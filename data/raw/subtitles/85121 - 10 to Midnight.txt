(police radio)
Nestor Crittenden. That´s with two Ts.
Tell you exactly how l did it.
Straight-edge razor.
When l catch ´em breaking the Lord´s
commandments, l rip ´em with the razor.
You gonna stick me in jail?
Not today, Nestor. We´re full up today.
Come back next week.
Stupid flatfoot.
Never tell you nothing again.
No wonder you never catch nobody.
- Jerry, don´t do that.
- What´s new, Leo? You onto something?
The captain issued a statement.
Didn´t you get it?
l could fart a better statement than that.
Are we friends or not?
- l won´t quote you directly.
- What?
You won´t quote me?
You won´t mention my name on the TV?
And you call yourself my friend.
- lt´s not nice, Leo.
- Jerry, l´m not a nice person.
l´m a mean, selfish son of a bitch.
You want a story, but l want a killer,
and what l want comes first.
Bye now. Don´t wait up for me.
Have fun.
Hi.
Where are we going?
Back to the lake, l hope.
(soft rock on stereo)
(switches music off
Hi, Fran. ls it as good as they say?
lf not, ask for your money back.
- Will we get our money back?
- No way.
- Don´t by any chance know her name?
- Not by any chance, no.
- lt´s Tina. Why?
- Nothing chanced, nothing gained.
lt´s my fifth time l´ve seen this movie.
- l haven´t even seen it yet.
- You´re gonna die!
- Robert Redford´s so gorgeous.
- l like Paul Newman.
Tina. Say hi to Warren Stacey.
Hi, Warren. How are you? Fine,
thank you, Tina. Hot buttered popcorn?
Would you mind
sitting somewhere else?
No, indeed. Wouldn´t mind at all.
l´d rather sit here.
Popcorn?
Now look what you´ve done.
Shame on you.
Don´t go away mad.
(woman moaning and sighing)
Honey.
(screams)
What the hell...?
(sobs)
(girl sobs)
Warren, don´t hurt me.
Why me? Warren, l´ll do anything for you.
lt´s so sad when they die at the end.
Come on.
- He´s so cute.
- Don´t even look at him.
- He´s cute, though.
- Yeah, that´s his problem.
- No hard feelings, l hope.
- Wanna bet?
Come on, don´t be like that.
Let´s start over.
You don´t like popcorn.
How about a drink?
Don´t tell me you´re not old enough.
We´re just not that hard up for company.
Wait a minute.
He´s only trying to be friendly.
- So what d´you have in mind?
- Forget it.
l wouldn´t wanna come between you and
your girlfriend. Good night, sweethearts.
Don´t do anything l couldn´t do better.
(siren)
Charlie! Charlie, come over here!
Get the camera!
- Who discovered the body?
- No comment at this time.
- Can you give us their names?
- Not till the families have been notified.
Were they both naked?
How were they killed?
Anything l might say, without further
investigation, would be speculation.
That´s mine.
- What?
- The chewing gum. l dropped it there.
McAnn. Paul McAnn.
lt´s not a very propitious way
to meet, is it?
You might say that.
Don´t throw things around
where we´re looking for evidence.
l´m sorry. l wasn´t thinking.
- l see you´ve already met.
- Yeah.
Let´s get on with it. Come on.
Come on.
What do you notice about the MO, Leo?
That girl that was killed
last Christmas Eve, Lorraine Partridge.
Right. Same scene.
Captain Malone and l think
the boy was incidental.
lt´s obviously the girl the killer was after.
The boy just had the misfortune
to be with her.
Misfortune?
ln the case of both victims,
death was caused by the severing
of the intestines and major arteries,
causing massive haemorrhaging.
This is all all right, but can you tell us
something that we can use?
The Johnson girl´s blood type
is the least common: AB negative.
ln addition, there´s evidence
of a hepatitis infection, now dormant.
Was this girl raped, doc?
There´s no evidence of forcible entry.
- l could have told you that.
- On the basis of what?
lf anybody does something like this,
his knife has gotta be his penis.
Karen, where´s Betty?
l´m sure she´ll be here soon.
l guess maybe she overslept.
You guess maybe?
Don´t you live together?
Yes, but sometimes
she spends the night with a friend.
A friend. When she comes in,
l wanna see her.
- What is it, Warren?
- This is Karen´s typewriter.
Put it down.
Yes, ma´am.
Works fine now.
Just needed some cleaning.
- Thanks.
- You´re welcome.
lf l need you, l´ll call you.
l guess she should change
her sleeping habits.
Would you mind
your own damn business?
What do l care? She screws around
and loses her job, what´s that to me?
Go away, Warren.
Who is this?
What are you saying?
Oh, no!
Oh, my God, no!
- Betty´s dead.
- What happened?
No! No!
Does anyone know
what happened to her?
l spent five years as a patrol cop.
ln all that time l thought
l´d learn to adjust to almost anything.
lt´s funny, this sort of thing,
the personal stuff,
- l suppose in time you become inured.
- Become what?
Able to face the parents
of a butchered girl.
You just don´t let your feelings
become involved.
- You´re only there for the information.
- You smoke?
Not any more.
lf you were smart, you´d quit too.
l know. lt´s a filthy habit.
Hazardous to your health,
offensive to everyone around you.
Have l left anything out?
Sometimes you talk like
you should have been a school teacher.
That´s not surprising. My father was
professor of social psychology, Berkeley.
Oh, yeah? And you´re a cop?
Lieutenant, l don´t think
you have a low regard for cops.
What l do think is you regard me
as a profound pain in the ass.
- Finally said something l agree with.
- l´ll try and raise my level of performance.
That shouldn´t be too hard.
l used to live in this neighbourhood.
That building was once a drugstore.
The owner was hooked on morphine.
His wife tried to have him put away,
so he killed her.
The jury found him temporarily insane.
Six months in the nuthouse
and he was pronounced cured.
A week later he shot his parole officer.
You sure this is the right street?
lt´s the right address.
Mr and Mrs F L Johnson.
- Oh, jeez.
- What´s the matter? You know them?
God, yes.
Their daughter and my daughter,
they were friends. God.
- You wait here.
- Wouldn´t it be better...
No, wait here.
l don´t believe it. Leo.
lt´s good to see you.
Marge. Come here, Margie.
Excuse my appearance. l work
on the night shift now. l just got up.
Leo Kessler!
Good Lord, look at you.
You haven´t changed a bit.
- How long has it been?
- What is it, Leo?
- Can we talk inside?
- Come in.
What´s wrong? What is it?
Don´t let your feelings become involved.
Jesus, can´t you drive any faster?
Before... whatever his name is -
Dale Anders. Who else?
She dated a lot of fellas.
Never a night somebody didn´t call up.
What are the names of the guys
she went to bed with?
l wish we didn´t have to ask this,
but we´re looking for a motive.
All the names you can remember.
Before Dale, there was Larry Williams,
Lou Porter, George Latham.
There was a guy she didn´t go to bed with
but who called up all the time.
Mexican or something. Every once
in a while he´d say something in Spanish.
- What´s his name?
- He´d never say his name.
All he called up for was to,
you know, talk dirty.
- Did he talk dirty to both of you?
- Just to Betty.
Start checking out these names,
find out if any of them spoke Spanish.
All right, Lieutenant. Thank you, Karen.
Karen, l know this is hard on you, but l´d
like you to show me Betty´s possessions.
Everything.
l hope you won´t make her look cheap.
She wasn´t, honestly.
- lf only you´d known her.
- l knew her.
And though this body be destroyed,
yet shall l see God,
whom l shall see for myself and mine
eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.
We brought nothing into this world,
and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
The Lord gave
and the Lord hath taken away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
Unto almighty God we commend
the soul of our sister departed,
and we commit her body to the ground,
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
- Thank you very much.
- l´m very sorry.
- Thank you.
- God bless.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you?
- How am l?
l´m sick because it wasn´t so long ago
that she was my best friend.
Have you found out anything,
or am l not supposed to ask that?
Me and McAnn here, we´re working on it.
- This is Paul McAnn. My daughter Laurie.
- Hi, how do you do?
Excuse me. See you in a minute.
- Are you a cop?
- So they tell me.
- You don´t look like a cop.
- Your father´s of the same opinion.
You don´t sound like a cop either.
ls that good or bad?
l didn´t say if it was good or bad. l just
said you don´t look or sound like a cop.
Do you live with your father?
No.
When my mother died,
he and l went our separate ways.
- l´m a student nurse.
- Really? You don´t look like a nurse.
What´s a nurse supposed to look like?
You take after your father, don´t you?
You think so?
l don´t. Excuse me.
Nice talking to you, Miss Kessler.
Thanks for coming.
Anything at all to report?
Nothing. But we´ll get him, l promise you.
l thought of something.
lt could be important.
Betty always kept a diary,
everything she ever did,
everybody she ever went out with.
Too many. Some of them the worst kind.
Excuse me. Don´t l know you?
- Do you?
- Well...
l´m Laurie Kessler.
Haven´t we met before?
Have we?
Maybe not.
(Betty´s father) l thought of something.
lt could be important.
Betty always kept a diary,
everything she ever did,
everybody she ever went out with.
(front door opens)
(phone rings)
- Hello.
- Hi, Karen.
- Hi, Tim.
- How are you bearing up?
l´m a wreck.
l can´t sleep and l can´t stop crying.
- l´m coming over to take you out.
- You´re a darling.
l just don´t feel like going anywhere.
l think l´ll just get a bite to eat here
and try to get some rest.
Why don´t you come over
in a couple of hours?
- OK, that´s great.
- You´re an angel. Bye.
(soft music on radio)
Mr Stacey.
Lieutenant Kessler, Detective McAnn.
Can we talk to you?
Come in, please.
- Didn´t l see you at the funeral?
- Yeah, and we saw you.
- Been shopping, have you?
- You´re very observant.
(police radio)
What´s that?
Sorry. Miracle of modern science.
Sit down, please.
l´ll just put these things away.
This is a nice place.
How long have you lived here?
About a year.
lt appears you´re something
of a movie buff.
l try to see everything worthwhile.
- You´re into karate, are you?
- Helps keep me in shape.
Nothing takes the place
of regular exercise, does it?
l see you keep yourself informed.
lt´s not often someone
you know personally gets murdered.
How well did you know her?
- Same as the other girls in the office.
- You ever take her out?
Once.
- Why only once?
- She wasn´t my type.
We talked to everybody
that went out with her.
Maybe you can shed some light
on what we learned.
- What´s that?
- This is Betty´s diary.
We got it from her roommate.
She kept what you might call
a graphic record of her experiences.
For instance, ´´So conceited that when
he said did l wanna go to bed with him,
it was like he was doing me a favour.´´
- That´s Larry Williams. You know him?
- No.
´´Always talking about
his Corvette and cabin cruiser,
but never once bothered
to mention having a wife.´´
George Latham. You know him?
No.
´´Good-looking but what a creep.
Makes my skin crawl.´´
´´l told him to get lost.´´
´´Creep called me up again.
Creep asked me to the office picnic.´´
´´l said l had a date. He said l was lying.
That made me mad.´´
´´l said l wouldn´t go with him
if he was the last man alive.´´
You know who that is?
l´ll give you a hint: you.
They say one shouldn´t
speak ill of the dead.
But the truth is,
she was not a nice person.
- No morals at all and terrible manners.
- l know what you mean.
A man can only take so much abuse
before he strikes back.
That´s not what l mean.
- Where were you on the night of the 6th?
- At the Aero Theatre.
- Betty Johnson was murdered on the 7th.
- l assumed you meant that night.
Anybody see you there?
The cashier. The manager.
A couple of girls l talked to.
- What was the movie?
- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
The one with Newman and McQueen?
Newman and Redford.
Shall l tell you the rest of the cast,
what it´s about?
That´s not necessary.
These are games we play with
just about everybody. Nothing personal.
Can l use your bathroom?
Help yourself.
This is first-rate.
lt´s a beautiful colour.
l´ve never seen a bullfight, have you?
- A couple.
- Where, Mexico?
Tijuana.
They really as gory as people say?
Not if you think of it as a spectacle.
l suppose that´s a valid point of view.
Shouldn´t be so quick to judge, right?
After all, football´s a fairly brutal sport.
Boxing. Nothing very elevating about
two gorillas beating each other to a pulp.
- This corrida de...
- Corrida de toros.
- What does that mean?
- Bullfight.
- You speak Spanish, huh?
- A little.
(police radio) 3L99. 3L99.
Phone the station.
- May l use your telephone?
- Of course.
Detective McAnn.
Lieutenant.
- Kessler.
- Karen Smalley.
Who?
Pretty girl.
The one Betty Johnson lived with.
- Where?
- The apartment.
l´ll meet you there.
Sorry to bother you.
Thanks for your help.
That´s OK.
lf there´s anything l can do...
This is Detective McAnn. He´ll take you
downtown and get your statement, Tim.
l didn´t do it.
Christ almighty, she was my girl!
- l know you didn´t do it, Tim.
- All right, Tim. Let´s go.
- This where you found the diary?
- Yeah.
- Figure that´s what he was looking for?
- Yeah.
And l got a pretty strong hunch
who it was.
After the funeral, you went
from the cemetery to the market.
l did.
But you didn´t get home
until three hours after the funeral.
That´s a hell of a long time
to spend in a market.
Are you telling me or asking me?
You were informed of your right to remain
silent. You agreed to answer questions.
He´s making charges.
Only the DA´s office can bring charges.
You haven´t been charged with anything.
l´ll ask the questions simpler.
- Where did you go after the funeral?
- l went for a walk.
You went for a walk. Why?
- l was upset. l felt bad.
- About what?
When someone you know is murdered,
maybe you feel good. l don´t. l feel bad.
Even about a girl
who was such a bad person -
no morals, no manners?
Warren, you ever been arrested?
No.
Were you ever taken to juvenile court?
For breaking your neighbour´s window
and throwing a dead animal inside. A cat.
l was 1 2 years old. Stupid thing to do,
but l was angry. l´d been punished.
Sure, for hurting
the neighbour´s daughter.
- You cut her with a knife.
- lt was an accident.
- You like hurting girls?
- l won´t answer that.
Look at him.
That´s the fella you saw and you´re sure?
- Yes, of course.
- What was he wearing?
- A red jacket and jeans.
- Designer jeans. He looked very neat.
He was repulsive.
- When did you see him?
- Outside, before the movie.
- And then when he sat down by me.
- By us.
And afterward, on the way out.
You saw this guy before, during
and after the movie. You sure about that?
Yes, l´m positive.
(Kessler) Did you ever
take her out, Warren?
l drove her to work a few times, that´s all.
Just not your type, huh?
Her boytriend objected, so l stopped.
The girls in the movie theatre,
were they your type?
No.
Thanks, kids.
You can go home now.
When´s the last time
you made it with a girl, Warren?
- That´s none of your...
- Last week, last month, last year?
- l refuse to answer.
- Never.
Never, because girls won´t
have anything to do with you.
But you get back at them. Betty and Karen
and God knows how many more.
- l won´t listen to your filth!
- Warren, do you recognise this?
- Leo, knock it off.
- Ever seen one of these? What´s it for?
Cat got your tongue?
lt´s for jacking off, isn´t it?
And these pictures,
you recognise the girls, Warren?
Look at them.
Look at them, Warren! Look at ´em!
- Stop it!
- Hold it!
You can go home, kid.
Get him outta here.
You better quit while you´re ahead.
Get him outta here.
- Leo, have you lost your mind?
- You can forget about this.
Have l gotta remind you about evidence
obtained under duress? lt´s inadmissible.
Right. The way the law protects
those maggots out there,
you´d think they were
an endangered species.
Will you give me a break?
Let´s not get into that.
The facts are we´ve got no evidence
and we can´t hold this kid.
He´s got an ironclad alibi.
- Do you believe it?
- Everything he says checks out.
The theatre and the market. We
questioned him about the Partridge girl...
Yeah, at the time of the murder he was
in a downtown hotel in bed with a whore.
- Do you believe that?
- Every case is a poker hand.
A good hand you stay,
a bad hand you fold.
You´re telling me you´re gonna fold.
l´m gonna stay.
He´s our man, Captain.
l´m gonna get him.
Hello.
l´d like to see Lieutenant Kessler, please.
l´m his daughter.
- You say he´s your father?
- Yeah. He´s my father, l´m his daughter.
- l´ve got something for him.
- l´ve never heard him mention a daughter.
That´s because it seldom
crosses his mind that he has one.
l almost had him the other day.
l blew it.
Bring him in.
l´d like to have another whack at him.
- (phone rings)
- Clem, bring him in.
Bring him in for what?
Any knifing, rape,
any obscene crime at all.
Just haul him in.
- Give me another chance at him.
- Malone.
- Leo, your daughter´s out here.
- Ask her if she can wait.
Tell her to wait.
What do you say?
l don´t know.
- McAnn, what do you say?
- l´m not sure if l´m qualified, sir.
Then l´m not sure you belong here.
What do you say?
lt wouldn´t take long
for Warren Stacey to hire an attorney
to charge us with harassment
and get an injunction.
(phone rings)
Malone.
- She can´t wait, Leo.
- l´ll go see what she wants.
How about it?
You know that from a legal standpoint,
we can´t lay a finger on this guy.
l remember when ´´legal´´ meant ´´lawful´´.
Now it means some kind of a loophole.
Miss Kessler, your father´s busy.
ls there something l can do?
Yeah, l guess so.
There was this guy at the funeral.
l couldn´t remember where l´d seen him.
Till l found this.
lt´s from Betty Johnson´s office picnic.
That´s me, Karen, Betty. Dale Anders,
her boytriend, the one that was killed.
And that´s the guy from the funeral.
Do you know who he is?
- What about him?
- Betty was scared of him.
- Do you know who he is?
- ls this the only time you ever saw him?
Yes. Now quit trying to act like a cop.
l may not look like a cop to you,
but l am a cop, that´s my job.
Will you please answer the question?
Why was she afraid of him?
He was always talking about
people who put him down
and how he was gonna
get even with them.
- May l keep this?
- Sure.
- ls there anything else?
- Yeah.
Tell my dad if he´s too busy to see me,
he might try calling me sometime.
Oh, and l don´t think
he´ll have any trouble getting through.
At the hospital they know l have a father.
Miss Kessler. Thanks for the help.
Sure.
(phone rings)
All right, all right, l´ll get it.
l wanna borrow that sweater of yours.
Was it in here?
Would you shut up, please?
- Who?
- Wanna turn on the TV?
Laurie.
- Make some tea.
- l did it last night. Your turn.
- Hello?
- (Spanish accent) Hi, baby.
How´s it going? How are you?
l´m fine. Who´s this?
You don´t know me but l know you.
You´re beautiful. l love you.
What good does it do to love me
if l don´t know who you are?
Quiero mamarte la panocha.
- What does that mean?
- lt means l wanna eat your pussy.
You give me blow job,
l give it to you in the ass.
l love you, baby.
You have reached a disconnected
number. This is a recording.
Who was that?
Just some creep.
Thanks for bringing in the photograph.
- Did it mean anything?
- Possibly.
(McAnn) We´re always looking
for new information.
Dad, is there something else
you wanna know?
- Just came to see how you were doing.
- l´m fine.
- Working you hard, are they?
- Like slaves.
At least you get to wear a nice uniform.
Why else would l wanna be a nurse?
lf you hit a snag or anything, let me know.
l could pull a few strings.
l know the superintendent.
Dad, you didn´t come all the way here
to tell me that. Now what´s on your mind?
Can´t l be interested in how you´re doing?
Sure.
- Just don´t pull any strings, OK?
- OK.
- ls that all you´re gonna eat?
- lt´s all l have time for.
l only have a few minutes.
l´m paying for both.
- Paying for three.
- That´s some lunch, Dad.
Coleslaw and quiche.
- l hate quiche.
- Then why did you take it?
l thought it was pie.
And coleslaw makes me sick.
- Let´s get organised about the party.
- l can swing some grain alcohol.
You´re kidding? That´d be terrific.
Doreen, Bunny, Ola,
this is Detective McAnn.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
- You don´t look like a detective.
- So l´ve been told.
Excuse me.
Are you and Laurie´s dad partners?
Actually, right now l´m trying
to measure up to his standards.
- Nice meeting you.
- See you later, Laurie.
Bye.
His standards of what?
What the hell kind of remark is that?
Your father´s been out
on the firing line for over 20 years.
Oh, God.
Do you have any idea how many
commendations he´s received?
He´s an outstanding public servant.
Nobody says he isn´t.
But when my mom needed him
or l wanted him, where was he?
Out on the firing line
earning commendations.
What is your problem?
Your father´s a cop.
- You´ve gotta make allowances for that.
- l´ve been doing that for 20 years.
This place is an ulcer factory.
What´s wrong here?
Detective McAnn was just telling me
how much he admires you.
You might call this a testimonial lunch.
Laurie, wait a minute.
Dad, l´ve gotta go to the lab.
l wanted to tell you
l´m sorry l missed you yesterday.
l´d like to do better.
Let´s have dinner sometime, OK?
Sure.
Why not?
l gotta go.
lt was a pleasure
to see you again, Miss Kessler.
l am good company, aren´t l?
You wanna go to a party tonight?
- l beg your pardon?
- We´re having a party. You wanna come?
- And you´re inviting me?
- Dad, is he always this slow?
Yes or no? l´m late.
Thank you very much but... l´m busy.
OK, bye.
- Busy doing what?
- Frankly, l don´t think we´d get along.
Dad, l forgot. l got an obscene phone call
last night from some creep.
- What did he say?
- The usual garbage.
This one had a Spanish accent.
- About that party tonight, Miss Kessler...
- Yeah?
l´ve changed my mind.
What time shall l pick you up?
Attach the microphone to the receiver
and to record press these two buttons.
Keep him talking.
Get him to say as much as possible.
- Do you really think it´s the slasher?
- Better safe than sorry.
This police radio, nobody outside
the department´s supposed to have this,
so just use it in case of emergencies only.
- You´re not trying to worry us?
- l´m trying to scare the pants off you.
That´s a new approach.
Most fellas do it manually.
Another thing - l don´t want you
going anywhere alone, especially at night.
- Was all this your idea?
- No, most of it was your father´s.
For reasons l don´t quite comprehend,
he seems to be fond of you.
No accounting for taste.
(disco music )
- lt´s hot in here.
- What?
- l said it´s hot in here!
- Take your jacket off.
- What?
- Take your jacket off.
- l can´t. l have a gun.
- Why do you have a gun?
He´s an officer of the peace.
lf you disturb the peace, he´ll kill you.
Hide your cocaine
and no shooting up in the toilet!
You´ve just ruined my whole evening.
- Having a good time?
- A wonderful time.
And to think l almost turned you down.
When l was in college
l really used to love this sort of thing.
- l must be getting old.
- You could be.
Do you have any dizziness,
shortness of breath?
- Maybe we should check your prostate.
- You´ve got to stop being so shy.
Are you... married?
You might have asked me that
before you invited me here.
Your moral standards are so high, l´m
sure you would have told me if you were.
Besides, the only reason you came here
was cos you thought
l needed protection from Mr Obscene.
- That is not entirely true.
- (woman yells out)
Don´t move.
Don´t shoot. We weren´t doing anything.
lt´s all right. Don´t be alarmed.
Just carry on. As you were.
lt´s OK.
ls that what you call keeping the peace?
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.
(Laurie) Thanks for dinner. lt was terrific.
Thanks for inviting me to the party.
l had a nice time.
l had a date with an intern,
but he had to cancel.
lt´s OK. l thought he was a pain.
l thought you were too.
l thought you were
fairly obnoxious yourself.
- Changed your mind?
- l´m thinking about it.
Don´t strain your brain.
The last thing l wanna do
is get involved with a cop.
l don´t blame you.
Good night, Miss Kessler.
What are you doing Saturday?
Saturday´s my day off.
(phone rings)
The phone.
- Hello?
- Hi, baby.
What´s doing? How you been?
Oh, it´s you again.
How about we get together?
What you say?
l don´t usually go out with strangers.
What did you say your name was?
Call me Pedro. That means Peter.
l got the biggest one you´ve ever seen.
That´s nice to know.
What d´you have in mind, Pedro?
l take you to a motel.
We do it every way there is.
How you like it - up, down, front, back?
Whatever suits you, amigo.
Where should l meet you?
- What you say?
- Tell me what hotel. l´ll meet you there.
Like hell you will.
Don´t fool with me, bitch!
But l thought you loved me.
Kiss my ass, cunt!
l love to stick it to you, that´s what l love.
Your father´s a pig,
your mother´s a whore.
Who told you?
That´s supposed to be a secret.
l wouldn´t piss on the best part of you
if you was on your knees begging for it.
- Don´t fool with me, bitch!
- But l thought you loved me.
Kiss my ass, cunt!
l love to stick it to you, that´s what l love.
Your father´s a pig,
your mother´s a whore.
- Laurie must be really scared.
- lt shook her up pretty badly.
l gave her a police radio,
showed her how to use it.
You didn´t tell her this is the guy
we´re after, did you?
Why have her thinking 24 hours a day
she´s in mortal danger?
- She is, you know.
- Yeah, l know.
We gotta do something.
We can´t just sit around.
l know, l know.
l´m gonna have to think about this.
ln case no one ever told you,
your daughter´s something very special.
Yeah, l know.
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.
(loud pop music )
(music stops)
Smells like pretty good stuff.
Confiscated material?
You testing to make sure
it´s the real thing?
- l didn´t expect anybody this late.
- l guess not.
Listen, l have a tape here
l want you to give to Milliken.
Have him make a voice print and compare
it with the one we have on Warren Stacey.
- Where do you keep that tape?
- ln the file.
Better make sure it´s still there.
- l will.
- You will? When?
- You want it now?
- No big rush.
As long as you do it
within the next five minutes.
- Was there anything else?
- No.
- Just see that Milliken gets right on it.
- Yes, sir.
l hope you don´t feel
you have to say anything about...
lllegal possession of marijuana.
Yes.
l don´t see any evidence.
l can´t bring any charges against you.
- Much obliged, sir.
- Me too.
(Stacey) l was 1 2 years old. Stupid thing
to do, but l was angry. l´d been punished.
(Kessler) For hurting the neighbour´s
daughter, cutting her with a knife.
- lt was an accident.
- You like hurting girls?
l won´t answer that.
Call me Pedro. That means Peter.
l got the biggest one you´ve ever seen.
l take you to a motel.
We do it every way there is.
Same voice print.
lt´s the same man, no doubt about it.
You want me to take him to court on this?
lt´s a lousy misdemeanour.
You´re gonna get 30 days at most.
What´s that gonna accomplish?
Gives us 30 days to find something
to hold him permanently.
What do you think, McAnn?
l think whatever Lieutenant Kessler
asks for is what he should get.
Then get a warrant and pick him up.
- What´s all that?
- You told me take his clothes to the lab.
Just the clothes
he was wearing on the 7th.
- Red jacket, striped shirt, blue jeans.
- And the suit he wore to the funeral?
OK. That too.
Perfect match. Blood type AB negative.
Also evidence of hepatitis, now dormant.
Then that´s it.
How do you figure a guy like this? Sets up
a perfect alibi and then blows it with that.
Why didn´t he have them
cleaned or burn them?
l think that might look fairly suspicious.
Suspicion leaves a reasonable doubt.
This makes him look awfully dumb.
- He doesn´t strike me as dumb.
- Everybody makes mistakes.
l made one myself last night.
l forgot to have Kessler sign
for the tape he picked up.
Last night? l was with Kessler last night
till one in the morning at his house.
lt was about two.
Anyway, have him come in and sign.
Sign here. Standard bail bond agreement.
What it´ll cost you.
- All l want is out.
- That´s what we´re here for.
They put you in, l get you out,
Mr Dante keeps you out.
- What´s he looking at, Dave?
- Did they read you your rights?
- Did you?
- Of course.
Good boy.
We plead not guilty, demand a jury trial.
With their backlog,
nobody´s gonna pay any attention.
Sexy phone call. l can practically
guarantee you a suspended sentence.
Excuse me.
l´m talking to my client. Do you mind?
l have something more
for you to talk about.
We found some blood
on your client´s clothing.
- We´re gonna rebook him. Murder one.
- What?
See you at the arraignment.
You dirty shit! He´s lying. There was
no blood on my clothes and he knows it.
You dirty shit!
He´s lying! He´s lying! He´s lying!
No!
No!
They´re coming out now!
Ask the DA.
Hold it. OK! Hold it!
Hold it!
He´s been charged with first-degree
homicide and held without bail.
Evidence will be presented at
the pre-trial hearing. No further comment.
You did it. Now tell me how you did it.
- Just lucky, l guess.
- Hell, luck? You´re terrific.
How does it look to you, Mr Dante?
l welcome the opportunity to prove
that all the evidence against my client
is not only flimsy, it´s fabricated.
- What do you mean?
- You got a dictionary? Look it up.
- How well did you know her, Warren?
- Did you do it?
- How well did you know her?
- Did you love her?
Dante says the evidence against
his client is fabricated. Care to comment?
- What evidence?
- Ask him.
- He wouldn´t say.
- Makes it unanimous.
- Why would he say fabricated?
- They always say that.
Daddy, l gotta go.
l´ve already missed two classes.
l´m real proud of my old man.
And you too. First time l saw you
l said ´´That´s a good detective.´´
- l don´t remember that.
- l said it to myself.
- l think l´ll go down with her.
- You never answered. Why fabricated?
- What´s he up to?
- Forget it.
McAnn. Can l have a minute of your time?
l´m in a hurry.
Tomorrow l´m gonna
call you as a witness.
l´m gonna ask you about
the evidence against Stacey.
What about it?
You know there were no blood stains
till someone planted them.
Who says that? Warren Stacey?
McAnn, you can deny it now, but if you lie
in the witness stand, that´s perjury.
Perjury is a serious offence.
Threatening a witness
is fairly serious too, Mr Dante.
Who´s threatening?
All l´m asking for is the truth.
´´You will know the truth
and the truth will make you free.´´
lf you don´t know the truth,
you´d better find out.
See you.
Hello, McAnn. This is Kessler.
l´m not interrupting anything?
lf you have a girl there, l´ll hang up.
- There´s no girl. Just me.
- l haven´t seen much of you lately.
l thought you might have died of old age.
l´ve been meaning to call you, Laurie.
lt sounds like a lame excuse,
but l´ve been very busy.
Got a new partner, a new assignment.
l´ve got your radio here.
l was kind of expecting you
to come by and pick it up.
- Maybe say hello, if you felt like it.
- Sure, l´ll do that.
ls this Paul McAnn, the detective?
l feel like l´m talking to a stranger.
l´m sorry. l just had
a lot on my mind lately.
Look, l´ve got another call.
l really have been thinking about you.
l would like to see you.
l gotta go. l´ll call you.
- Yeah, sure.
- (hangs up)
Hello.
Wanted to remind you, in case you forgot,
when you testify tomorrow, remember,
you´re sworn to tell the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God.
See you in court, McAnn.
When Kessler came to get
the tape and the voice print,
did you discuss anything else with him?
Shit. He told you, huh?
Let´s hear it.
The boys grabbed a load of... stuff.
They burned most of it.
- But this was such high quality...
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?
- Were you with Kessler the entire time?
- Except when l went to get the tape.
- When you came back, he was here?
- Where else?
- No, l mean here, right here in this room.
No, he was in there.
- What´s kept in that refrigerator?
- Blood samples.
Nice, very nice. Just right.
Let´s hear it again.
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.
Good boy. We can always
plead insanity later.
- l´m not insane.
- l know that.
But in case we have to go that route,
l want you to know we´re in good shape.
No matter what you´ve done,
the worse it is,
the more the jury´s gonna think that
no normal person could have done it.
So we work out a routine, say
you´re two people - one good, one bad.
You start hearing voices, the bad boy
telling the good boy what to do.
He doesn´t wanna do it
but he can´t help himself. You see?
- You´re saying l´m a schizo.
- No, Warren.
l´m saying that you walk
out of a crazy house alive.
They´ll carry you
out of a gas chamber dead.
What?
Stacey´s lawyer´s putting me on the stand.
He says Stacey was framed.
Dave Dante´s not a lawyer. He´s a shyster.
He says the evidence was planted.
Do you know that to him
this is one big game?
lf he gets Stacey off,
he´s won the Super Bowl
and to all the scum out there he´s a hero.
l went back to the lab
and talked to the technician. l asked...
What the hell did you do that for?
Why didn´t you ask me?
l was afraid you might tell me
you planted those blood stains.
Yeah, well...
l did.
Jesus, Leo.
- Why?
- What kind of a question is that?
- We´d have nailed him soon.
- After counting how many more dead?
He had to be stopped. The only way
to do that is to put him away.
- You understand what l´m saying?
- Yes, l understand what you´re saying.
You want me to commit perjury.
What do you think he´s gonna do?
He´ll lie about everything.
Stacey´s not a cop.
He didn´t take an oath.
An oath? Jesus Christ!
Would you take an oath
that he´s not guilty?
You go in that courtroom and forget
what´s legal and do what´s right.
lf l thought it was right,
l´d swear to anything you say.
We will then present evidence
that the crime was premeditated
and then we will call witnesses
to testify that the defendant
harboured malice towards the victim...
testimony confirmed
by the victim´s own diary.
We will produce evidence that there were
blood stains on the defendant´s clothing...
that he acknowledges wearing
on the night of the murder,
expert witnesses from
the police forensic laboratory
testifying that the blood type...
Excuse me, Your Honour.
Your Honour,
may we approach the bench?
You may.
Your Honour, l must ask for a dismissal of
charges against the defendant, based on...
ls that true, Lieutenant?
You planted the evidence?
Yes, sir.
- What have you got to say, Warren?
- How does it feel to be a free man?
How do you feel about what Kessler did?
- He´s the one that belongs in jail.
- He violated due process.
He thumbed his nose at the Bill of Rights.
He´s a disgrace to our system
of law enforcement.
- Stacey says you should be in jail.
- Why don´t you go (BLEEP) yourself?.
Turn that damn thing off.
What we need is another drink.
Come on, Laurie. l think
you´ve had too many drinks already.
No.
We´re celebrating.
First time l ever got drunk with my father.
Here.
You know, Dad...
You oughta fire your housekeeper.
l´ve been fired once today already.
That´s enough.
Son of a bitch.
- l hope he gets what´s coming to him.
- l hope it´s sooner than later.
You know, they´ll probably
give him a medal.
l´m talking about Stacey.
- l´m talking about McAnn.
- Ah, well...
l broke the law.
He wouldn´t buy it.
20 years ago
l would have felt the same way.
l don´t care.
- l still hate him.
- Laurie, you´ve had enough.
- That´s enough.
- Dad, you don´t understand.
Alcohol is the most effective
tranquilliser l know.
- You´ve still had enough.
- When you get up in the morning...
Oh, my God, the morning.
l´ve got a test. l´ll call a cab.
- l´ll take you home.
- l´ll call a cab.
l´ll take you home.
You don´t argue with your father.
l´m not arguing, Dad.
You wanna take me home, OK.
Listen, Laurie,
if Stacey calls again, you call me.
And if you can´t reach me by the phone,
use the police radio.
OK.
And tell your friends up there
to keep the doors locked.
They shouldn´t open up
to anybody that they don´t know.
You know, Dad,
l bet when you had your daughter,
you didn´t expect
she´d be so much trouble.
l don´t mind if you don´t.
You stay in touch, OK?
(phone rings)
Yeah, hello.
- Hello?
- How you doing, Mr Kessler?
Enjoying yourself?. l am.
l told you what a dirty shit you are.
Now the whole world knows, right?
What´s the matter, cat got your tongue?
To forgive is divine, they say.
But l don´t aspire to being an angel.
Know what l mean?
You tried to kill me. l owe you for that.
And l always try and pay what l owe.
Be seeing you, Mr Kessler.
Likewise, Mr Stacey.
l used to like this job.
Now l hate coming to work.
l´m gonna put in for a transfer.
Why can´t they get rid of him?
- l can´t sleep nights.
- Me neither.
What´s wrong, Mrs Byrd?
What are these doing here? Answer me.
- l didn´t put ´em there.
- No?
- Who did?
- Not me. Why would l?
Take them down.
Get rid of them this minute.
- Will you listen to me?
- l´m going straight to personnel.
l don´t want you in this office.
Jeez.
- You trying to commit suicide?
- l was gonna ask you the same thing.
You´re making life very unpleasant
for Warren Stacey.
- Who told you that?
- We in the police have our sources.
You keep it up,
he´s gonna come after you.
You think so?
lf you wake up one day
with your throat cut...
l´ll thank you for warning me.
(car starts)
Say hello to Laurie.
Sure. l´ll do that.
Tell her l drive by the dormitory
several times a night.
Me too. l´m obliged.
(soft rock music starts)
(phone rings)
(Kessler) Are you enjoying yourself,
Mr Stacey?
- Come on, get in.
- First things first, hon.
50 one way, round the world 75.
OK. Come on.
- What can l do for you?
- The girl that was standing with you here.
- Where does she usually take her tricks?
- Who wants to know?
Usually the Regis. Sometimes
the Drexel or the Golden State.
Thanks.
You want drinks, just call the bar.
l´ve got my own.
Give me a wake-up call in three hours.
Wowee.
You got your work cut out for you.
That´s too much. My union
don´t approve of me drinking on the job.
- lt´ll loosen you up.
- l´m already a loose woman.
Bottoms up.
That´s the story of my life.
- l´m gonna take a shower.
- What for?
Cos l like to be clean.
Buddy. A guy about this tall, young,
came in with a hooker. Which room?
- lt ain´t our policy...
- Which room? Here.
224.
Give me the key.
Don´t l know you?
Haven´t we met before?
- (door buzzer)
- Will you get that, Bun?
- Looking like this? You get it.
- l can´t. My toast´ll burn.
Take it out, dummy.
Come on, buddy. Get me a line.
(door buzzer)
- (phone rings)
- Somebody get the phone.
- Bunny.
- OK, OK.
- Who is it?
- Hello.
- Flowers for Miss Kessler.
- l´ll take ´em.
- She has to sign for them.
- Laurie, somebody bought you flowers.
- Who are they from?
- Who else? Your good-looking cop?
- Don´t open the door.
- What?
Oh, my God. Don´t open that door!
No! No! Oh, my God! No! No!
Leave me alone!
- Where is she? Where is she?
- She isn´t here! She´s not here!
Kessler. Laurie Kessler.
Where is she?
Laurie Kessler! Where is she?
- Where is she?
- She´s at the hospital!
- You´re lying!
- l´m not!
- You´re lying!
- No, l´m not!
- She´s not here, not here.
- Where is she?
- Hello, McAnn. Come in, McAnn.
- Kessler, this is McAnn.
- County hospital, dormitory three. Over.
- Ten-four. We´re on our way.
County hospital. Hit it.
- Where? Tell me where she is.
- She´s at the hospital.
- You´re lying!
- No! Really, she´s at the hospital.
l won´t hurt you.
She´s... she´s at the hospital.
l swear. l swear.
She´s on duty at the hospital.
That´s where she is.
She´s working.
No!
Why didn´t you tell me? Why did you
make me think she was in there?
(police radio)
- My father´s gonna kill you.
- No, he´s not. l know where he´s at.
That was him on the phone.
He´ll be here any second.
Oh, yeah?
Then l guess l´d better hurry up.
(car approaches)
That´s him. He´s here!
You can count on this. l´ll be back.
(car starts and drives off
Laurie?
McAnn!
Don´t shoot. Get back! Get away!
l tried to keep you from running loose.
Now there are three more dead girls.
You drove me to it.
That blood on my clothes.
Those pictures on the wall.
Digging into my personal life. lt´s my life!
Those phone calls. On me every minute!
All those girls.
You sick son of a bitch.
l am sick.
l am sick.
l didn´t know what l was doing.
lt´s like l couldn´t control myself.
Why else would l kill girls
l don´t even know?
lt´s like l´m two different people.
l hear voices telling me what to do.
Once it begins, l can´t stop!
So go ahead, arrest me.
Take me in.
You can´t punish me.
l´m sick.
They can´t punish me for being sick.
All you can do is lock me up.
But not forever.
One day l´ll get out.
One day l´ll get out.
That´s the law. That´s the law.
That´s the law!
And l´ll be back. l´ll be back.
You´ll hear from me.
You and the whole fucking world!
No, we won´t.
