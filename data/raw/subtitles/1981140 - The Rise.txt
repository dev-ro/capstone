[ Man ]
All right then, son.
Why don't you tell me your name?
[ Man #2 ]
You already know my name.
I'd like you to tell me
what it is anyway.
Why?
It's for their benefit.
Who's "they"?
Whoever's listening.
My name is Harvey Miller.
What's your date
of birth, Harvey?
April 19, 1989.
You're 22.
That's a good age.
Wish I were 22.
- I wish I were a lot of things.
- What do you wish
you were, Harvey?
- Somewhere else.
- Fair play.
Harvey, I want you
to do something for me.
- What?
- I want you to tell me
what you're doing,
sat in front of me,
bleeding and under arrest.
- Where shall I start?
- Well, I do hope you don't
miss out on the bit...
where a mutual acquaintance of
ours finds himself being wheeled
into an intensive care unit.
What makes you think
I know him?
Statements of about
30 eyewitnesses.
I knew I should have been
a little less conspicuous.
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
You can joke about it
if you like, Harvey,
but this is
a serious situation.
I can tell by
the state of your face
that you didn't launch...
a surprise attack
on Mr. Roper.
At least, if you did,
it wasn't very successful.
Given his track record,
you may have well acted
in self-defense.
But he's the one
in hospital.
If he doesn't wake up,
you're going to be in
a lot of trouble.
And if he does wake up
and he's more convincing
than you,
you're still gonna be
in a lot of trouble.
You've only been out
a matter of weeks, Harvey.
You're not going to be
the golden boy
in any court in England.
There'll be no probation
with 12 months off for
good behavior this time round.
So, if I consider you to be
soliciting lies, or acting
in an uncooperative manner,
it will be construed as
a violation of your probation.
I'll return you
to prison tonight.
Do you understand
what I'm telling you, Harvey.
- Yeah.
- Well, be sure not to leave
anything out then, won't you?
If you really want full picture,
we're going to be here a while.
You have my undivided attention
for the rest of the night.
[ Prison Door Buzzes,
Clicks Open ]
[ Harvey ]
Demps, it's Harvey.
I'm out.
Got my papers last night.
Didn't get a chance to phone.
Listen, mate,
I-I need a lift.
Ain't got enough money
for the train.
I'll go to the station,
wait outside till 3:00.
If-- If you haven't, um--
[ Line Beeping ]
Oh, for fuck's sake.
[ Exhales ]
Shite haircut, dated clothes
and a nervous stare.
You've either been
let out of prison
or kicked out of the army.
You're all right, Demps.
Not bad, Harvey.
Not bad.
Look at you.
You've not changed a bit.
Can't believe
it's been six months.
It's been a year.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Can't have missed you
very much then.
Cheeky bastard.
I know.
Twelve months, three days
this morning.
Didn't think I'd recognize you,
seeing as you gave us all
the fuck-off when you went in.
Nothing for a year.
Then a phone call
asking for a lift.
You know how it is, Demps.
I didn't want you to see me--
I know how it is.
Come on.
You look good, mate.
Thanks.
How was it?
Lot of reading.
Lot of wasted time.
Came through it though.
You're a harder man than me.
Like that were ever
in question.
Do you want to walk home?
[ Car Alarm Chirps ]
Probably be safer.
What happened
to your van?
Impounded by Christians
for exceeding tobacco limit.
[ Chuckles ]
Temp replacement.
Naught to 60?
If you push it down
a big hill. Get in.
Good-looking lad like you,
12 months inside?
Must hurt to sit down.
Twat.
You weren't though--
You know--
- Just drive, you dickhead.
- [ Chuckling ]
Fucking bloody Christ.
[ Demps ]
Charlie didn't know
it were Dodd's bird.
Dodd had been keeping her
well away from us since
he started seeing her...
for fear she'd realize
he was the least interesting...
and ugliest out of his
group of mates, which he is.
But he should have known
that none of his mates
would have shagged her...
had they known
it were his bird.
I'm not taking sides here.
But if you're Charlie,
you're in a nightclub,
there's a decent bird hanging
round your neck, practically
begging you for a length,
you don't stop to say,
"Sorry, sweetheart, I would
shag you six ways from Sunday,
but a mate of mine's
got this bird who
I haven't even met yet,
and for all I know
it could be you."
Fucking daft. You try
explaining that to Dodd...
when he walks in on Charlie
banging her from behind...
and slapping her ass
on Sunday morning.
Poor bastard was so destroyed,
he passed out there and then.
He only popped round to see
if Charlie fancied having
his dinner round theirs,
and found the door unlocked--
terrible business.
Say, Harvey?
Harvey!
I took the scenic route
'cause I know you like
the countryside.
Didn't expect to be
talking to myself,
ignorant bastard.
Sorry, mate.
What were you saying?
I were telling you about Dodd
catching Charlie doing his bird,
and how they've been
at each other's throats since.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, yeah.
Got a letter from Charlie.
Gotta laugh, haven't you?
Talking about letters,
you heard anything
from your mum yet?
No.
Fair enough.
Stay with me then, eh?
[ Chuckles ]
â™ª [ Electronic ]
[ Chattering ]
Hey up, lads.
Nice one, Dodd.
Keep 'em coming.
3.20 a pint.
Fuck off.
Oh, must've broke your heart
handing that 20 across the bar.
Can I have me change,
by the way?
Must make a nice change from the
antifreeze you've been sucking
out of condoms the last year.
You can't really
appreciate a drink
you don't risk your ass out for.
Mmm.
Where's mine?
At the bar,
you fucking prick.
Fuck you, Dodd.
How many times?
I didn't know
it was your fucking bird!
Yeah, well,
you didn't ask.
Fucking dick.
- It wasn't worth
the fuck anyway.
- Say it any louder, Charlie,
and I'll swallow you,
you scrawny little twat!
Will you two pack it in?
- We're meant to be celebrating.
- Sorry, Harvey.
Cheers.
Cheers.
So I hear it's true, Harvey.
Prison does do things to a man.
You what?
I were worried.
I had to tell them.
- Tell them what?
- That despite the fact
that it's been a year...
since you've even seen a bird,
you haven't once mentioned
the need to get your knob felt.
- [ Sighs ]
- Sex, Harvey, by a woman.
going past the massage parlor
on Sheffield Road, trying
to drop the hint. Nothing.
Have you ever been
in that place?
Those Thai girls aren't girls.
- Are you fucking serious?
- [ All Laughing ]
Your fucking face.
He loves a fucking Thai
lady boy though, that one.
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll make a move soon.
So it's not because
you're saving yourself
for anyone in particular.
We were just wondering
whether you were gonna try
for reconciliation.
No, too much time's passed.
Don't even know her anymore.
What she knows of me,
she don't like.
See, the reason I ask is that,
she's out at the edge
of the dance floor, alone.
To the best of my knowledge,
she's not a regular here.
- Where?
- She's right there.
- Fucking hell.
- Looking good,
isn't she, mate?
- She always looked good.
- Too good for you.
- What're you waiting for?
- I'm not gonna go talk to her.
- Why not?
- What would I say?
I'd rather a hello?
- Realistically.
- Well, a million things.
- It's not like there's
no history there, is it?
- No, there's too much.
History, Harvey,
is just oils on a canvas.
You own the paint,
so you get to change
your own picture.
Where the fuck
did you get that?
Dear Deidre.
Don't mean it's not true
The worst thing
about history, Harvey,
is that people only tend
to look at it through
the tearful eyes of regret.
Oh, God, stop now,
you sleazy bastard.
Oh, you are so full of shit.
Go talk to her.
- Give her one from me, pal.
- "Give her one from me"--
How profound.
- Fuck off, Charlie.
- Budge up.
Look at the sleaze go past.
Oh, it's all over me trousers.
It's good to
have you back, mate. Here.
That's the key to our flat.
I suggest that if you do
have a little sleepover
with the lady,
you do it at her place,
because you're in
the sitting room.
[ Dodd, Charlie Arguing ]
Shut the fuck up.
Your problem is your bird.
You need to get it right.
She came on to me, knowing--
Because you're not
talking to me--
I told you, you speak again,
I'm gonna knock you out.
You're not talking to me
'cause a bird is getting
in between our relationship.
Must be further
than it looks.
Seemed to take you forever
to make it over here.
Yeah, I think I look good too.
Thanks for mentioning it.
Can I buy you a drink?
I'm sure you can.
Will I drink it if you do
is the question
you should be asking.
Would you?
No.
But maybe that's 'cause
I just bought this one.
If you bought me another,
it'd go flat,
and the ice would melt before
I had a chance to take a sip.
Or maybe, it's because
I hate the very sight of you.
- Do you?
- Maybe.
Can I sit down, wait till
your glass is empty?
See how the theory pans out?
That depends.
On?
What you want.
Shall I sit down?
Don't you want
to have sex with me?
Well, it's been
over a year, Harvey,
and like you wanted to say,
I do look good.
Or do you just want
to talk about your feelings?
I'm sure it's a while
since you've been able
to open up emotionally.
Or are you going to apologize
for being the absolute prick
that broke my heart?
How about all three?
Come back to bed.
I won't be able
to walk around the ward.
- No, to sleep.
- My shift starts
in half an hour.
- Made you a cup of tea though.
- It's the middle of the night,
for Christ's sake.
- Can't you call in sick?
- It's 7:30, and, no, I can't.
It'll take half the day
to walk back to the estate.
Trust you to inconvenience
matters by moving.
Too many people
I don't want to see
on that estate.
I know the feeling.
[ Zipper Zips ]
I left you my number
with that cup of tea.
I really got to go.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Hello.
Hi.
Dempsey?
She's gone, mate.
[ Chuckles ]
What time
do you call this?
- You've got my stuff.
- I know.
My mum chucked it all
in the skip
before she left.
We saw her do it,
so me and Charlie got it
all back and fetched it here.
You never told me.
I wanted it to be a surprise,
see the smile
on your little face.
If I'd known
you'd be bangin' around the flat
in the middle of the night,
I would've thought twice.
Thanks, mate.
Say it with tea.
Lots of tea.
With lots and lots
of sugar in it.
Hang your stuff
up there, mate.
Where you off to?
For a shit.
What time is it?
Half-9:00.
Kitchen's there.
See you at 10:00.
Why are you not talking still?
[ Dodd ]
Don't you fucking start.
[ Sizzling ]
[ Dodd ]
Fuck off.
Shut up, you dickhead,
and read the pa--
- Hey up, Harvey.
- You two lovebirds
still bickering?
- All right.
- Come sit next to me, pal.
Pretty face like yours,
12 months inside--
Oh, it must hurt to sit.
Already got this one
from Dempsey.
You thieving little bastard.
You know that's my joke.
- You should've picked him up
in your car.
- I don't have a car.
- And that's my fault, is it?
- Fuck off!
So, the engagement's
back on then?
The way she ran out
this morning, I wouldn't
bet your pension on it.
- Cold shoulder?
- No, I--
I don't know.
Don't matter.
I won't be around long enough
to make a go of it anyway.
Where are you going?
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you all about.
Out with it.
[ Smacks Lips ]
Right. Basically...
I'm considering a business
proposition that were put to me
by a lad on the inside.
Yeah, admit it, you already
think I'm a dickhead.
The lad's a Dutch kid
called Dirk.
- [ Chuckling ]
- Dirk.
He'd already been inside
seven months when I got there,
and 11 left.
- What were he in for?
- Possession.
He'd been running club nights
back home in Holland
since he were 17,
decided to come here
and try his luck
at the same thing.
Why?
Misguided romantic notions
of England being
the home of dance music.
His problem was,
he didn't realize
that Leeds ain't Amsterdam.
Too fucking right.
When the local police sussed...
the reason his club was
so popular were because
the foreign manager...
were flooding the dance floor
with cut-price Dutch E's,
they had a stroll down.
Oh, dear.
That's what his dad said.
Although his dad's
an high court barrister,
so he was bound to be a bit
upset at the embarrassment.
However, he ain't
disowned the boy.
He's offered to help him
get started in a business,
knowing how an ex-con is shafted
for career prospects.
- That's nice of him.
- Those people
are laid back, Dodd.
[ Chuckles ]
His terms are...
Dirk goes back to Holland,
promises to stop being a twat,
and finds a way to match
his dad's investment,
show him he's serious.
- What's the business?
- Coffee shop.
- [ Chuckles ]
- In the tourist center
of Amsterdam.
Solid reputation,
managing to maintain
a good profit even now.
How much is it?
He's accepted Dirk's offer
of 110 grand English.
Bargain.
Offer's good for a month.
- Where do you come into it?
- He's asked me
to come in with him.
With money?
Yeah, Dodd, with money.
What does he think
your parents do?
He knows I ain't got 55 grand.
Knows I can't
get it on my own.
He's happy for me
to bring my three best mates
into the deal.
- Oh, that's good of him.
- There's still a problem.
What?
- We haven't got
50-odd grand either.
- [ Chuckles ]
No.
But Steven Roper does.
I don't think he's going
to give you a loan,
if I'm honest with you.
I don't give a fuck
what he won't give me.
He owes me for a fucking year,
and he'll pay me for that year.
[ Clatter ]
You were never
an idiot, Harvey.
So I'm going to assume
there's some logic here.
Yeah, there is.
[ Harvey ]
Maybe I should give you
a little background.
Are you aware of the details
of my case?
You were released
from prison six weeks ago,
having served half
of a two-year sentence...
for possession of heroin
with intent to supply.
First offense of any kind.
I can tell you
with a straight face--
I've never supplied
anything to anyone.
Only seen heroin once
in my entire life.
What do you know
about Steven Roper?
He's not a very nice man.
He's done time for
assault and robbery,
but that was some time ago,
because he is now
a legitimate businessman running
an industrial security firm...
out of the Rise Estate.
However, it has been
speculated that he's involved
in drug trafficking.
[ Harvey ]
Speculated?
We haven't been able
to build a solid enough
case against him.
- Why do you think that is?
- Maybe he's a lot smarter...
than we'd like to give
a two-bob thug credit for.
Steven Roper employs
a well-considered set
of diversionary tactics.
- You can't seem
to counter them.
- Diversionary tactics?
There's a lofty title--
nothing like giving it credence.
The money's coming in,
and you can't seem
to counter it.
All right, Harvey,
I'm listening.
Why don't you tell me
about Steven Roper's
diversionary tactics?
You're a detective, Inspector.
I'm sure you're familiar
with them.
I'm old, forgetful.
Why don't you jog me memory?
Okay. Step 1:
The controlling influence
of fear.
If you have built a consortium
of commission-based
contraband vendors,
you run the risk of being
name-dropped to the police...
if those in your charge
be faced with incarceration.
Also, there are those
who may wish to make money
on your behalf...
and then forget
to pay their dues,
of which examples must be made.
While there are guns,
their use brings
unwanted police attention.
This being the case,
the sensible criminal maintains
a fearsome reputation...
with good old-fashioned
hard graft.
Step 2: Evading detection.
Though the clandestine art
of surveillance
exemplified by the police...
owes little to the techniques
employed by government agents
in acts of espionage,
their constant presence
still requires
creative vigilance.
The trick is to keep the gear
moving from place to place...
so that even if the law
tracks its whereabouts,
it's long gone before
they can do anything about it.
Of course, police incompetence
can't take all the blame.
[ Tires Screech ]
After all, the drug squad
must be short staffed,
what with all
the traffic violations
requiring their manpower.
Step 3: Building a case
for citizen harassment.
- [ Beeping ]
- [ Ringing ]
You lot like nothing more than
to have someone else
do your job for you,
which is why
you are such big fans
of the telephone tip-off.
If the drug squad receive a call
from a concerned citizen...
giving details
of a drug cache at a residence
in a problem area,
they will generally act
on the information.
[ Man ]
Police!
[ Shouting ]
Of course, the trick is
to make the anonymous
phone call yourself...
after you have made sure
there is nothing even resembling
an aspirin on the property.
So you can laugh as you watch
the boys in blue...
sweat as they tear apart
your house to no avail.
[ Shouting, Indistinct ]
Why are you so fucking worried?
It's fucking bollocks!
When they finally call off
the search, your house
will be in such a state...
as to warrant a generous
compensation payment
from the taxpayer,
amid claims that your reputation
has been unfairly tainted.
Repeat this procedure four times
over a 12-month period...
and you can rest assured that
even the fire brigade wouldn't
dare enter your property...
if the whole fucking street
were ablaze.
Step 4: Throw the dog a bone.
This is where I come in.
The drug squad needs to fill
a certain quota of arrests
and seized quantities...
to prove it's keeping
the streets of England...
as clean as the Armitage Shanks
in Buckingham Palace.
By the same token,
the criminal needs
the drug squad...
to have the inclination
to continue helping them
perpetrate Step 3,
so, every now and then,
a big chimp will stitch up
a little monkey.
I'm the monkey.
Steven Roper was the big chimp.
In this particular example
of the successful execution
of Step 4,
I came home from a night
on the piss to find my flat
had been broken into.
A quick look around
told me two things:
One, there were no burglars
in the flat.
Two, the stupid fuckers
hadn't stolen anything
when they had been.
I didn't see what were coming.
In my defense,
I were fucking rat-assed.
It being January
I was also cold,
so I closed the door.
Police! Police!
Put the phone down!
Put it down!
Acting on an anonymous tip-off,
your boys came flying
into the house,
armed with a search warrant.
It took them about 30 seconds to
find the 200 grams of heroin...
I had so cleverly
hidden underneath
the TV Guide on the desk.
[ Chattering ]
It took the jury even less time
to find me guilty of the charge,
as the only evidence to
back up my claim that someone
had broken into the flat...
and planted the drugs
had been destroyed by
the police battering ram.
No further interest
were taken into my plight.
Well, there is
certainly authenticity
to what you're saying.
If you're familiar
with the methods,
why don't you do something?
Because they work,
like you said.
I've got to wonder how
a decent, upstanding citizen
like yourself...
understands the intricacies
of small-time drug trafficking.
It's not rocket science.
No, it's easy money.
That's why you do it.
I'm not getting
the year back either way.
Just trying to paint
a better picture.
Fair enough.
Go on.
Where was I?
I don't give a fuck
what he won't give me.
He owes me for a fucking year,
and he'll pay me for that year.
You were never
an idiot, Harvey.
So I'm going to assume
there's some logic here.
Yeah, there is.
[ Prison Buzzer Buzzes ]
Got their heads up their ass,
mate, so they can stay low
on the radar.
[ Harvey ]
I never had much to say
to any other inmates.
That don't mean my ear
weren't constantly bent
in the favor of prison pastimes.
Believe me, if these clowns
knew the half of it,
I'd be doing 20 easy.
[ Harvey ]
Giving it the big "I am."
[ Man ]
Their problem is,
they forget who you are.
Think you're old,
think you're a joke.
[ Harvey ]
In prison, it was all you hear
night and day.
You get sly enough to learn
to block it out.
[ Man ]
Soon stopped smiling when
he saw the fucking sawed-off.
Soon lost his heart as well.
[ Harvey ]
Although I don't think they care
if you're listening anyway.
I drop off all over the north.
Even the biggest twats from
the smallest two-rip town...
would have a wedge
the size of your mother's ass.
Take this one guy
from this filthy
nowhere estate over yonder.
The Rise,
I think they call it.
[ Harvey ] Of course you prick
up your ears when you get wind
of something interesting.
I'd drop a key off
to this twat called Steve,
first Monday of every month.
Flash bastard,
would open this
big green safe,
and he'd take the cash
from a pile that high
like it was pocket change.
Pass it over with a wink
and a "what the fuck
are you smiling at?"
Now, he always had
a four-strong team around him,
but you pull the right tool
at the right time,
and you can liberate
the content of his belongings,
smart as you like.
[ Dempsey ]
Great. Roper keeps
his money in a safe.
The man lives in that office
since he got into security.
I think he'd
notice us popping in,
trying to hacksaw it open.
Safe can't be in his office.
The Scouser said he used
a meat-delivery van
as his cover,
so he'd only drop at
suitable places-- restaurants
or big pubs that serve food.
No, the only place
round here that fits
the description...
is the Rise Club.
Okay. The club makes sense
as a dropping point.
But why would Roper
leave his money in there,
not in his own office?
He doesn't own the club.
Albert's in his pocket,
and it puts some distance
between him and his money...
in case he ever gets
his collar felt.
I suppose his firm
looks after the club,
so he thinks it's safe there
as in his own office.
Even more so.
According to this bloke,
the safe's in a basement office
with no windows, one entrance,
and the door's secured
like a bank vault.
How much are we
talking there?
At least 60 grand.
- [ Dempsey ]
Tiger Woods without the birds.
- [ Charlie ] Fuck off.
[ Dodd ] How do you know
the Scouser ain't just talkin'
out of his ass?
[ Harvey ]
Be a good guess
if he just made it all up.
But you don't know for sure?
No, but I'll find out.
How?
[ Dempsey ] It's the first
Monday of March next week.
If the meat van makes
a delivery to the pub,
we'll know it's sound.
We can stake out the pub
from the flat.
No, we'll need more than that.
The van turns up,
all it will prove is it used
to be a meat delivery van.
We need to get in the office,
see if there's
a green safe there.
If there is,
we'll know he wasn't lying,
be ours for the taking.
Jesus Christ.
Are you lot taking the piss?
Look, Harvey.
I know Roper fucked you
right up the ass.
But for Christ's sake,
drug money? Safe cracking?
Fuck off.
-Why dismiss it straight off?
-Because we're not safe-crackers
or cat burglars, are we?
Or coffee shop owners,
for that matter.
Harvey's not a smack dealer,
but he did time for it.
Somebody does this stuff,
so it can be done. Why can't
we be the ones to do it?
Because we won't know
where to fucking start.
It's not the type of thing
you want to fuck up, is it?
Come on, Charlie.
We're just talking here.
No, we're not.
We're serious.
- What? Just pack up and piss
off abroad just like that?
- Yeah.
And you're not
taking the piss?
- You can come back and visit.
- Oh, come on.
This is our home, mate.
I know.
[ Stammers ]
I'll understand
if you don't want to do it.
But if we do,
we've got a share
in a proper business.
All in it together.
It'll mean a new start
for everyone.
But on the upside,
it will mean a new start
for everyone.
Fuckin' hell, Dempsey. An
hour ago, you were the sort of
man who were content with life.
Now you're talking about pulling
off some crackpot robbery
and escaping around the world?
Skint old birds knocking
on the door at the crack of dawn
looking for cheap fags...
and a fortnightly trip
down to the Joke Shop.
Lovely. I'll--
I'll take another 10 years,
please. Bollocks.
Talkin' about your fuckin'--
So what?
You're so in love
with stacking crates
in that freezer...
two nights a week on agency pay,
not willing to
consider your options?
That's just temporary,
you fucking prick.
I'm a qualified
fucking welder,
and when it picks back up
and the factory's reopened--
There'll be machines
turning in there
before your factory's reopened!
Go fuck yourself, Demps!
At least I've got
a fucking trade!
And turn your nose up at me?
I've worked hard
for what I've got.
What was it you got?
A C.S.C.S. card,
a broken promise
and a chip on
your fucking shoulder!
Such a fucking prick!
Can't even start about you,
you fucking ponce!
All I'm saying is, wouldn't you
rather pack it all in and go
and sit in a nice, warm cafÃ©,
watching the world go by,
chatting to tourists--
Oh, fuck off.
[ Dodd ]
It's a bit of a pipe dream
in all fairness, Harvey.
What if it's not?
What if the money
is in that safe?
It's our chance
to have something of our own.
I'm not saying
it's not worth a look.
And if it looks good?
I don't know.
- Think about doing it.
- [ Charlie Scoffs ]
Charlie?
You lot are off
your fucking heads!
Hey.
Hey, come on, Charlie.
[ Harvey ]
Leave him, mate, He's got
to make up his own mind.
[ Dodd ]
So, what do we do now?
[ Dempsey ]
Wait till Monday.
Harvey.
Not going to say hello?
I'm not going anywhere,
so you may as well look at me.
Still handsome.
Thought maybe you'd have
a few scars now.
Only the kind
you can't see.
- How are you, Steve?
- Steven.
Been worse. Yourself?
Not too bad.
Well, it's been fun
catching up.
I don't want to have to
worry about you, Harvey.
Your concern moves me.
Don't get fucking smart.
I get the impression you
blame me for that spot of bother
you got yourself into last year.
That's fine.
Believe what you like.
But bear in mind,
I don't react well
when I feel threatened.
Is that why you're always
such an asshole?
Have that one.
Stay where you are.
Tell me, is it hard living
in a constant state of fear?
Fucking flying
if you think I'm scared of you.
No, you're not scared of me.
You're scared if you loosen
your grip on what's
yours for even a second,
someone's going
to come along
and take it all away.
Is that right?
Yeah.
And you know what?
What?
You fucking should be.
[ Dodd ]
Come on.
Oh-- No! Fuck!
I'll have you.
It's not much fun for me
listening to you play
on that thing, all right?
- [ Grunting ]
- Put the comedy channel on
or something.
When I'm on sentry,
you can do what you like.
When's that then?
Twenty-three minutes.
[ Sighs ]
Fuck's sake.
[ Door Closes ]
- Any sign?
- Not yet.
- But it's still early doors.
- [ Grunting Continues ]
- Go on, mate.
- I'll have him.
- Right, I'll get the kettle on.
- Yes.
Hey, watch out!
Oh, shit.
[ Laughs ]
Fucking wanker.
[ Woman On TV ]
It's in excellent condition,
but there's a small chip
on the back unfortunately.
It's a plate with
a big chip in it.
Who's going to buy that
for 70 quid?
You'd be surprised, mate.
If Winston Churchill
ate off it,
it'd be worth
a hundred times that.
It's a Princess Di
commemorative plate, Dempsey.
Just saying.
Hey up, lads.
We got a live one.
"Mikey's Meat."
It's-- It's Mickey's Meat.
What's the difference?
The "C."
[ Dempsey ]
Ah. Is that how butchers dress
these days?
Well, hello, soldier.
Look who it is, Harvey.
It's your best mate.
Want to go down to say hello?
It's the first Monday in March,
got a meat delivery man
who looks fuck all
like a meat delivery man,
and super Steven Roper
heading up his welcome wagon.
It's beginning to look
a bit like Christmas.
A lot like Christmas, Dodd.
- Come on, man!
- [ Chuckling ]
We're on.
[ Dempsey ]
A fucking lot like Christmas.
[ Dodd ]
What's the difference,
dickhead?
[ Woman ]
I've missed this.
Missed what?
You walking me to work.
Two buses and an eight-minute
walk from the estate,
just for the privilege.
I'm glad it's appreciated.
I'm sure I can find
a way to say thank you.
Oh, yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
The flat could do
with a cleaning.
Uh, no.
What's your plan?
What plan?
Your life plan.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
You've adjusted to normal life.
You have restarted
a relationship.
So now you've just got to
decide where you're going
to take your life.
I haven't given it
much thought.
You're lying.
I know how hard
it's going to be, but...
do you have to do it alone?
I know.
I know, I just--
just need a little time.
Yeah, I know.
Don't take too long, eh?
[ Brakes Squeaking ]
[ Air Hissing ]
[ Chattering ]
See you later, mate.
[ Grunting ]
[ Grunting Continues ]
[ Grunting ]
Hey!
What's Harvey planning?
Your mate Harvey.
What's he planning to do
to get back at me?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
If someone stuck me
behind bars for a year,
I'd make it my life's work
to track him down...
and watch him bleed out
through a hole in the face.
Look, I've only seen him once
since he got out,
and he hasn't said anything!
I'm going to give you
a message to give to Harvey.
Now, you tell him
that prison might have been
a nightmare,
but me,
I am fucking horrendous!
I'll tell him.
Oh, I know you will.
- No!
- [ Glass Shatters ]
[ Shouting ]
[ Shrieking ]
Let me out! Hey!
Hey! Let--
[ Shouting ]
[ Shouting ]
What's up?
Is Albert here?
Yeah, let's see
if he's still here.
â™ª [ Pop ]
â™ª [ Woman Singing, Indistinct ]
[ Sportscaster On TV,
Indistinct ]
â™ª [ Continues ]
Can I have a bit more
here and all, please?
[ Man ]
Yeah, no problem.
â™ª [ Continues ]
[ Buzzes ]
[ Man ]
Who is it?
Stan.
[ Door Buzzes ]
You've got a visitor.
Sit down.
Thanks, Stan.
Is that an original?
[ Sighs ]
What are you after, Harvey?
Let's not piss about.
I'm a busy man.
I just wanted a chat.
What do you want
to chat about?
- My membership.
- [ Chuckles ]
You don't have a membership.
But I used to.
I'd like to again.
Now why would I want to give
a convicted drug dealer
membership to my club?
Or even the privilege
of drinking in it?
I'm not a dealer, Albert.
And if I had been,
I paid for it.
I just want things
to get back to normal.
I can understand that.
I really can.
Okay, so, do you need time
to think about it or--
No, I'll be quick
and I'll be honest.
I wouldn't give a bollock
if the queen walked
through that door...
and gave you
a full pardon right now.
Your membership's
staying in the bin.
The only reason you ever had it
in the first place...
was 'cause it was
grandfathered in and the
committee wouldn't refuse you.
I don't like you, Harvey.
I don't really know why.
I just don't.
I never liked
your little mates either.
Smug little bastards,
the lot of you.
You can call me all the twats
under the sun if you like,
but that's the way it is.
Albert,
the past is the past.
If I acted in a certain way,
I apologize.
All I want is the chance
to wipe the slate clean.
[ Clatters ]
That... probably didn't
help my case, did it?
- It's time for you to leave.
- That were an accident, okay?
I weren't being petty.
Yeah? Maybe that's
your problem, Harvey.
You rub the wrong people up
the wrong way even when
you're having a day off.
Cost you dear in the past.
Cost you even more
in the future, lad.
- So you're saying
there's no chance then?
- Not a sniff.
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to take a piss.
Only went five minutes ago.
Must be the sound
of running water.
Shame you wasted
your time, Harvey.
No. It were a pleasure.
[ Harvey ]
I couldn't wait to tell
the lads I'd seen the safe.
I don't think I'd been
that excited by a sense
of discovery since I were 11,
realized an erection weren't
just for just pissing
over high walls.
[ Chuckles ]
Didn't last long.
Where's Charlie?
He's through there.
You can't go in.
His doctor's holding him.
Sit down.
How bad is it?
It's all right.
He's all right?
Obviously, he's a bit fucked
or he wouldn't be in here.
Listen.
He's conscious. The nurses said
his burns are not as bad
as we first thought.
But he's on a respirator
because his lungs are fucked
from all the smoke.
Harvey, it's gonna be
all right.
What happened?
Police told the nurse
he'd been dragged
out of a burning lockup.
He'd been locked in
and he'd taken a hiding.
Have they arrested Roper?
Charlie wouldn't
talk to them.
We'll fucking talk.
We know who did it.
We can guess.
- There's no witnesses.
What are they gonna do?
- This is attempted murder.
No.
It's some dickhead they
couldn't give a fuck about...
with smoke in his chest
and his mouth shut.
They're not going to put
a task force on it, Harvey.
Bollocks to the police then.
We know where Roper's gonna be.
If we go now,
he won't even see us coming.
All right, Dodd.
We're all upset here, but
let's not be fucking stupid.
I'm just thinking about Charlie,
lying in there,
shitting himself
at what's just happened to him.
Where's your mind, eh?
Fuck off, Dodd!
I'm thinking
about Charlie as well.
So we're not
gonna do nothing?
Look--
Look, right now,
we've gotta wait here,
make sure Charlie's all right.
Fuck that.
[ Ticking ]
[ Wheezing ]
There's a few quids
worth of kit here.
Starting to see
where all my money goes.
How are you, mate?
[ Coughing ]
- Never better.
- [ Exhales ]
I'm serious.
They've given me morphine.
Smackheads aren't
as big a set of twats
as you might think.
I'm so sorry, Charlie.
- It's not your fault.
- It is.
Roper's an asshole.
He did this to get back at you.
What did you ever do to him...
but get engaged to a bird
who knocked him back?
It's not your fault
he's an asshole.
And it's not your... fault
that we're mates.
[ Coughing ]
If I just...
kept my mouth shut
when I saw him the other day--
Fuck off, Harvey.
You're not having that one.
If anyone's gonna
feel sorry for themselves,
it's me, all right?
So, brave little soldier
all wounded,
must be getting
a bit of attention
from the ladies.
Oh, yeah. It's been like
the Playboy Mansion in here.
[ Chuckles ]
What are your nurses like?
Fat, foreign
and fucking ugly.
Your missus
on the wards today?
Yeah, she's on nights.
She'll be here somewhere.
Fuck off and find her.
Leave me to my painkillers.
Is it really bad?
No. I just like them.
[ Chuckles ]
Now go home.
It's the middle
of the fucking night.
I'll, uh--
I'll be back tomorrow.
Did you get a snoop around
in the office?
Uh, yeah.
- Safe there?
- Yeah.
So, are we on, or what?
We, Charlie?
I'll be out in less than a week.
A trio of twats like you?
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.
We'll be waiting for you.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Harvey ]
The job were a go.
Roper trying to kill one of us
put any wavering thoughts we had
straight to bed.
Which is the opposite
of what he intended.
If Roper was willing
to attempt murder
to make a point,
wouldn't your failure
to visibly appease him
elicit recourse?
We never gave his name
to police.
We may not have
packed up and left, but he had
no reason to believe...
we weren't quietly
capitulating.
But you weren't
quietly capitulating.
What were you doing?
Quietly planning.
We've got to be ready
to go on the 8th.
Two weeks Sunday.
Why then?
Easter weekend.
Fuck.
The members' excursion.
The what?
Rise Club trip.
Club trip to them. Thirty-five
coach-loads of people
in a convoy to Blackpool to us.
That's half the estate.
Lot less people to stumble
on what we're doing.
Pigging hell!
As it's a religious holiday,
not only will the estate
be a ghost town,
the club will
be closed by 10:00,
locked up by 11:00.
Yeah, but the coach
will be back soon after,
always before midnight.
Never before 11:00--
closer to half past.
Gives us a window.
A fucking small window.
Which means we got
to get it right.
No room for mistakes. None.
Roper won't be headin' off
on the trip though.
No. You can be
sure of that.
Is that Martin?
It fucking is.
That robbing bastard.
What's that about?
He gave him 80 quid
for a knockoff PS3
couple of weeks ago.
Turns out it was
an empty display shell
stuffed with lead shot.
Remember that PlayStation
you sold me, do you?
It's imaginative,
I'll give him that.
Shall we give him a hand?
No, he looks fine.
[ Grunting ]
Going to hospital
to see Billy Bragg there?
Yeah.
Taking Nicola out after.
Oh.
Going anywhere nice?
â™ª [ Dance Pop ]
He'll be out
in a couple of days.
He's a tough lad.
He's a lucky one.
Depends which way
you look at it.
Harvey. Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.
I won't do anything stupid.
Look at me.
I won't do
anything stupid, okay?
I swear on your life.
On my life?
Oh, that is chivalrous.
You can't swear on your own.
It's got to be the ones
you care most about.
â™ª [ Continues ]
Have you told your parents
you've been seeing me
since I got out?
Yeah, I told my mum.
Dad wouldn't approve.
Since when have you worried
about me mum and dad?
[ Chuckles ]
Seven months we were together,
and you still refused
to meet them.
- Never felt like
the right time.
- On my 18th birthday party?
See, that is--
that's more of a family affair.
- My mum loved you.
- It weren't your mum
I were worried about.
But you're right.
My dad never approved of you.
So... why do you care now?
Now I can't change his mind.
Has your mum
got in touch yet?
No. She won't.
I know she hurt you, but
not everyone will do the same.
The things I said before
I went inside--
I know you and Roper never--
Yeah, I know.
Don't matter.
It does.
Let's just forget about it.
Can you?
Yeah, I can try.
â™ª [ Continues ]
I still love you.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Dempsey ]
This isn't just
any fucking bird, pal.
This is Nicola.
Are you telling me
you can just walk away
without a word?
[ Harvey ]
I don't have a choice.
What's it going to do to her
if you just disappear?
Remember how I told you they
were going to put me through
management training at Weyland?
But you went from
bottom floor to office,
so I'm proud of you.
It were a good job.
Good money too.
I were gonna get
a flat in town
for me and Nicola.
Don't do this, Harvey.
Don't dwell on it.
We're moving forward.
I didn't tell you.
There was a Mr. Stewart,
the M.D. He said
if I topped out the course,
put me through on
the H.E. scheme,
I'd have full-time
management pay,
I'd work toward an LL.B.
When I finished that, he said
I'd move into legal to do
an L.P.C. and even my articles.
I-- I don't know what
any of that means, mate.
It means before I went inside,
I were five paid years away from
being a qualified solicitor.
Me.
I told Nicola.
Man, she was so proud of me.
Week later,
I were arrested,
and all that were left
were an embarrassed look
on Mr. Stewart's face.
Poor fucker humiliated
in front of everyone...
for thinking I could be
anything more than the loser
they all said I must be.
Roper fucked you.
There's no denying it.
But Nicola hasn't run away.
She knows who you are.
She knows
I'm back at the bottom.
I can't be her charity case.
That's why I pushed her away
before I went inside.
I said
some fucking nasty things.
She came back.
Yeah, right now
she's pleased to see me.
Thankfully I'll be gone
before the shine wears off.
I'm not saying you should
back out of the job
if she asks you to.
I'm just saying
you should tell her.
Oh.
[ Harvey ]
Third night in a row.
[ Car Doors Close ]
[ Dempsey ]
Why don't we just steal the gear
and sell it ourselves?
Who to?
Kids.
Get them hooked on a free trial
and laugh all the way to
the bank. [ Chuckling ]
[ Harvey ]
We went over different
scenarios, made lists.
Eventually came up with a plan.
Considering they're not
the most dynamic bunch,
the effort they put in
were pretty bloody impressive.
[ Chuckles ]
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
Here you go, Charles.
Here you go.
- All right.
- Cheers!

What are you doing here?
What's all this stuff,
Harvey?
- She surprised me at the door.
- And you let her in?
She just barged past.
I couldn't--
[ Nicola ]
So a year in prison
weren't enough?
And you think it's worth
going back, for what?
Robbing a fucking
working men's club?
It's not like that. Okay?
No one is going to prison.
We've got this all worked out.
So you break into club,
steal Steven Roper's money,
and then what?
Sail away
into sunset?
No, it's not how it sounds.
You swore on my life
you were gonna
leave this alone.
No, I swore on your life
I wouldn't do
anything stupid. Okay?
This isn't stupid.
You don't know the facts.
Oh, well, let's see if I do.
If your plan goes wrong,
you go back to prison.
Worse if it isn't the police
that catch you.
If it all goes right,
you were just gonna disappear to
another country without a word.
Either way, you were
going to leave me again.
I were gonna phone you when
it was all over and explain.
I wanted you to come with me.
Of course you were.
No, it's true!
You're so sweet, Harvey.
It's the truth.
- How am I supposed to know?
- I've never lied to you.
- You've never
trusted me either.
- That's not true.
That is the truth.
I really thought it was
just an excuse, that you
were going to prison...
and thought it'd be easier
if you didn't have someone
waiting for you.
But it weren't, were it?
You actually believed
the things you said.
No.
Yeah.
- You didn't trust me then,
and you don't trust me now.
- Of course I do.
If you did, you would have
told me what was going on.
- How could I put you at risk?
- If you loved me, you would've
asked me to come with you.
- I couldn't.
- Why not?
Because I didn't want to
hear you say no.
You're right.
You're right.
I'd have said no.
I would've asked you
to forget about all this
and stay here with me...
because this is
fucking stupid, Harvey,
and dangerous,
and I promise you that
if you go ahead with this,
I will not answer
that phone call.
It's your choice.
See, I don't have a choice.
I hope you see sense,
Harvey,
and if you don't
I hope you see
the morning after.
What do you want me to do,
just take it
on the fucking chin?
I've got no job, no future.
Am I supposed to just
fucking swallow it?
No problem, Harvey, mate.
Bad luck. Worse things
happen at fucking sea!
Am I supposed to be
a fucking saint or something?
[ Shouting, Indistinct ]
I'm sor--
I'm sorry, mate.
If she thought it were a
smash-and-grab, she really would
have thought you were an idiot.
[ Charlie ]
It's come around fast,
hasn't it?
[ Dempsey ]
The sooner the better.
Just think.
In 48 hours
we'll be away from here.
- Good, in't it?
- Is it?
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.
Just--
We won't be here anymore.
[ Dodd ]
We'll be...
somewhere else--
different language,
different money.
We won't even
know anyone.
Everybody speaks English,
the Euro's worth 90 pence,
and all three of your best mates
are coming with ya.
- I know, but--
- But what?
- You're not having doubts.
- Not exactly.
- So you are then?
- What if we don't like it?
What if we do?
It's a long way to go
to find out, Demps.
- It's a fucking
ferry ride away, mate.
- No, this is our home.
[ Dempsey Sighs ]
I don't know
anything else.
Bricks and concrete.
Same anywhere.
It's the people,
not the place.
- Still a lot to think about.
- You should've thought of that
before you quit your job.
- Before we put weeks
of work into it--
- I'm just saying.
Charlie, you've got a face
like a slapped arse.
- You having doubts as well?
- Have I said anything?
No, but you look like
you're going to,
so get it out.
You're worried about your mum.
Don't think she'll be able to
look after herself.
Will she be able to stay
off the piss long enough
to get shopping in?
Why don't you fuck yourself and
shut up about my fucking mum!
I'm not trying to
slag off your mother.
But if it's a worry,
I want to know now
and not tomorrow,
when we're halfway into job
to find out you've had
a change of heart...
and we're left standing
with our cocks in our hands.
It's not about
my fucking mum!
But I am
fucking worried.
- What about?
- About fucking
the whole thing up.
Christ!
Even if we did,
the police have their heads
stuck so far up their arse...
that they'd find Shergar
before it dawns on them
what we're up to!
Bollocks to the police.
I'm talking about Roper.
I'm not worried about
that asshole.
And that's the problem.
You're not, but you should be.
He's a fucking psychopath.
Don't think for one second
that if he tipples us,
it won't do us.
Together--
What's he gonna do?
Well, I don't know,
but it'll fucking hurt.
And it'll fucking last.
- So you're backing out.
- Did I say that?
It's the day before the job,
and I'm having some doubts
and I'm fucking entitled to.
All right.
So how about you then,
our fearless leader?
You're awfully quiet.
You're saying it all
for me.
Yeah, I am.
You're supposed to be
the one rallying the troops.
Oh, so Nicola's ultimatum
struck a chord.
Fancy a couple of years
in domestic bliss instead of
following up what you started?
- Fuck off, Demps.
- No, man.
You fuck off!
I've handed in me notice
on me flat,
I've sold the last of my CD's--
I've sold all me stuff!
I've put a lot of hours
into this job,
and I want that coffee shop.
I fucking deserve it.
Now, I'm not gonna
try and talk anyone
into anything,
'cause as far as I'm concerned
we've already made a deal.
Now I'm going home.
And anyone who hasn't
lost their bottle can follow.
I'll see you tonight,
or I'll see you around.

I would've told you sooner,

how you'd take it.
Me and the lads have
set something up abroad.
Our own business.
Working for nobody.
And when
we're up and running,
I'll have you over
for a visit and you can see
what your son's made of himself.
It's gonna be something.
You're gonna have to take care
of yourself for a while.
I know you can do it.

I hope things--
I love you, Mum.
Take care.

Nicola.
[ Engine Starts ]
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
[ Harvey ]
At the last minute,
when it becomes real,
you're gonna have doubts.
It's the line between planning
and actually doing it,
between fantasy and reality.
It's a hell of a line
to cross.
But you crossed it?
They all kept their word.
I kept mine.
That night
we went over the plan
to the smallest detail.
We had it locked.
Everybody set to 10:23 in...
5, 4, 3, 2--
Now.
[ Watches Beeping ]
I still think
we should've used mobiles.
Mobiles could have a delay.
Time is immovable.
Ain't that right, Harvey?
Come on, pal.
This is your mantra.
What? Yeah.
Just stick to the schedule.
We'll walk it.
- Are you all right, Harvey?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?
There ain't nothin'
you want to say?
Yeah, there is.
Let's fucking smash it.
[ Dempsey ]
Come on then!
Good night, girls.
See ya.
[ Women Chattering ]
[ Harvey ]
10:45. We move to
our first positions.
Ready to go
when the clock struck 11:00.
We expected
the first coaches home
in under 30 minutes.
It all had to move
like clockwork.
The alarm system
has an exterior bus network
by the telephone exchange.
This isn't the same
as an alarm control box...
which are housed
inside the building
for obvious reasons,
so we couldn't shut it down.
The best we could do was try and
suspend the individual exterior
alarm sensors one at a time...
and delay the transmission
of the signal.
One of us
had to take care of it.
He had eight minutes.
Another had to initiate
the actual break-in of the club.
His job was to
pave the way forward for
the third member of our team.
He had seven minutes
to do it.
The third member
had the unenviable task
of cracking the safe,
but his job wouldn't begin
until the others
had completed theirs.
And me? I had to make sure
the job were carried through
to the very finish.
Of course,
you know what they say
about best-laid plans.
[ Harvey ]
Charlie, I need you to do
something for me.
What, now?
You can't account for issues
like the weather
or nerves or human error.
If the tiniest element
misaligns,
the rest will follow.
Come on, come on, come on.
[ Clattering ]
Shit. Fucking--
[ Harvey ]
And that's when we panic.
[ Chattering ]
Don't take the piss.
Get your stuff together so we
don't have to keep the driver
hanging about all night.
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
[ Muttering ]
Come on, for fuck's sake.
[ Harvey ]
And panic inevitably leads
to mistakes.
[ Clanking, Rattling ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Alarm Blaring ]
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Harvey ]
That's when confusion
takes over.
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Alarm Continues Blaring,

[ Thunder Continues

[ Harvey ]
And before you know
what's happened,
you're left standing alone,
and it all comes
crashing down around you.
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Thunder Continues
Rumbling ]
[ Roper ]
Fancy meeting you here.
I'm gonna
fucking enjoy this.
Not too late, am I?
[ Harvey ]
And all you've got left is your
instinct for self-preservation.
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
Come on, shift your arses,
or you'll all end up
in the garage with the bus.
[ Mutters ]
Look at this.
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Albert ]
Come on, everybody.
Off now.
Call the fucking police.
[ Harvey ]
When I heard the alarm,
I should've made a run for it.
When Roper showed up
30 seconds later,
I should've run away,
but I just--
I couldn't.
Maybe there's a few things
I shouldn't have done.
That's quite a story,
Harvey.
[ Chuckles ]
Quite a story.
Now, I'm going to
have to ask you
a few questions, Harvey,
straighten out
a couple of details.
Understood?
You say
the alarm sounded...
and 30 seconds later...
you were stood
in front of Roper
outside the club?
Yeah, yeah,
that's about right.
Right.
Now, when the alarm
is triggered in a place
like the Rise Club,
it sends a message
to the security firm
that covers it--
in this case,
Steven Roper Securities.
The alarm was triggered
at approximately 11:15.
Emergency services
received a call from
a local resident at 11:16,
stating that the alarm
at the club was active
and had been for about a minute.
Our first officer arrived
at the scene at 11:19,
by which time the altercation
between yourself and Mr. Roper
had taken place.
Do you see
what I'm getting at?
No.
Right.
Now, if Steven Roper
was in his office...
on the other side
of the estate,
monitoring the security
terminal that indicated
the break-in at the club,
he would've had
four minutes to get across
the estate, on foot,
confront you,
slap you around a bit,
get knocked unconscious
and wait for the police.
It's not really possible,
is it?
No.
No, I suppose it's not.
So how long
had you been with Roper
before the police arrived?
Uh, a few minutes.
I mean--
[ Stammers ]
I-I turned up at the door
and it had already been busted.
Roper showed up.
We had an altercation.
He would've killed me.
All right.
He would've
fucking killed me.
All right.
We'll get to that later.
But what I want to know is
what Roper was doing at the club
before the alarm was triggered,
when it was closed for business
and you were trying to rob it.
- Mere coincidence?
- I don't know. Yeah. Maybe.
-I don't believe in coincidence.
-Maybe he were trying
to rob it himself.
Why would he do that
if he owns the firm
that protects the place?
A-An insurance job?
I don't know.
Maybe him and Albert
had the same idea as us--
- These three friends of yours--
give me their names.
- No, I can't do that.
Why not? They can't be
very good friends...
if they were gonna
leave you there
twisting in the wind.
They're not criminals.
I shouldn't have
got them involved.
You're probably right,
given the "coincidence"
we were talking about.
Now, I'd assume
a smart lad like you
wouldn't have...
announced your intentions
to rob Steven Roper
all over town,
so I also assume
the only people who knew
about this were you,
your three friends
and your estranged
other half.
Now, you've got to be
asking yourself, Harvey.
You've got to be!
Which one sold you out?
- No one sold me out.
- You really believe
it was coincidence?
Yeah. It's easier
than believing it wasn't.
Right. Well, let's stick
with that pretense.
But if I can speak to them,
they might be able to
get you out of...
at least some of the mess
that you're in.
I'm not giving you
their names.
You're gonna make life
very difficult for yourself
if you don't, Harvey.
The Rise Club
suffered a break-in
tonight.
We're gonna have to
charge you with
breaking and entering,
theft, A.B.H.,
and possibly even worse.
You've spent the entire night
incriminating yourself, Harvey.
Incriminating myself
as what?
Eh?
I didn't steal anything.
Roper was at the club.
Instead of taking his money
and disappearing into the night,
I got the shit kicked out of me,
- got dragged down here
and my mates ran away.
- [ Knocking ]
D.I. West,
can I have a quick word?
For the benefit of the tape,
Sergeant Kendon has
just entered the room.
I am pausing the interview
at 0130 hours.
Excuse me.
[ Door Closes ]
So? What you got?
I took Albert Redford
round the club...
in order to take
a full account of any damages
or missing effects.
Right.
So what's the verdict?
Tills along the bar have been
broken into and emptied of
a decent amount of cash,
but nothing else was taken.
Not even a bottle of Grouse
from the shelves.
What about the offices?
Anything taken
from the offices?
No. Albert was keen to take
a look, but nothing doing.
Bolted shut
like a bomb shelter.
A few quid
from the tills.
Not exactly Brinks-Mat,
is it?
[ Sighs ]
Right, well--
[ Chuckles ]
I guess
that's that then.
Not quite.
You haven't heard
the interesting part yet.
We found the money.
[ Knocking ]
[ Door Closes ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Sniffs ]
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?
No.
I've told you everything.
Now, you've noticed that
the tape is switched off?
Off the record,
just between the three of us,
anything else you'd like to say?
No.
I've told you everything.
Are you gonna
charge me, or--
- It appears
it's your lucky night.
- My lucky night?
The Rise Club
was broken into tonight,
as you already know.
Money within
the region of Â£1,200...
was stolen from
the tills in the bar,
which you don't know.
Officers have recovered
the money from the premises
of Steven Roper Securities.
What?
Steve Roper's fingerprints
were found on several
of the notes,
and alongside the money
officers found
something else--
a cellophane package
containing a powder,
brown in color,
which our friends
in the relevant department
tell me is heroin.
Five perfect fingerprints
have been recovered
from that package...
also belonging to
Steven Roper.
We've also heard
from the hospital.
He's still unconscious.
His face is a mess,
but he's stable.
Now, charges will follow
for you, Harvey.
A decent prosecutor
will have a lot
of questions...
about the force
you used against Roper,
but for now I'm content
to state for the record...
that I believe
self-defense is what
your actions constituted.
Now, being that the evidence
is painting the picture
that we're currently seeing,
I also believe it would not suit
the interests of the C.P.S....
to pursue
any further charges
against you...
concerning
the Rise Club break-in.
Where does that leave us?
Well, that leaves us
with conspiracy
to commit a crime.
Conspiracy?
Wh--
Well, conspiracy's
a funny thing.
[ Chuckles ]
Some might call it
jailing people
for thought crime.
And you?
Prosecuting a young man
for ballsing up breaking
into a working man's club...
would be an embarrassment
of the court's time.
So where does that
leave us?
Well, for now
you're free to go.
Right now?
Yes. Yes.
Just gotta process a few forms
and you'll be on your way.
Is it two or four?
Or five? I-I forget.
Sunday league
quarter finals,
there was a lad who
looked a lot like you...
put two away against Everton
in the second half.
We lost that game though.
Yeah.
It was
a good effort though.
It's a pity he was
let down by his team.
[ Door Opens ]
All right, thank you.
I'll follow you.
When Roper wakes up
and we charge him, his brief
will push for bail.
They'll set it high,
but he will have the money.
Understand?
Yeah.
Won't be long.
Right then, Mr. Miller.
You're free to go.
P.C. Nixon will escort you
to the desk sergeant
and get you signed out.
It's been fun.
It's been interesting.

[ Tape Rewinding ]
[ Harvey ]
Steven Roper
sent me to prison,
destroyed my life
and tried to murder my friend,
and he was gonna kill--
[ Tape Rewinding ]
I-I didn't lie.
Well, maybe a little,
but only by omission.
I had my--
[ Tape Rewinding ]
I had the shit kicked out of me,
got dragged down here
and my mates ran away.
D.I. West,
can I have a quick word?
[ West ] For the benefit
of the tape, Sergeant Kendon
has just entered the room.
I am pausing the interview
at 0130 hours.
[ Harvey ]
Hello, D.I. West.
I take it you saw the tape
were recording and decided
to investigate a little.
Now, you could go
running down a corridor,
screaming for a blue light,
bring me in
so we can talk more about
charges and evidence.
But what's the point
in doing that when
you can sit down, listen,
and not have to
break a sweat?
Go on. Sit down.
Comfortable?
Good.
Now, I feel
I shortchanged you earlier.
You sat and listened patiently
to a detailed account
of the last few weeks...
and I built it up,
but I didn't deliver.
I-I didn't lie.
Well, maybe a little,
but only by omission.
I had my reasons.
But now I'd like to
try that last bit again,
and this time I'll be sure
not to leave anything out.
[ Harvey On Tape ]
At 10:30 we left the flat
for our first positions--
one of us in the steelyard
to the east of the club,
another behind the wall
to the west,
and me and the third
on the wasteland at the back.
We each waited
for our time to move.
Night, Thompson.
Good night, girls.
Good evenin'.
Good night.
[ Harvey ] No one goes near
the front of the club
until it is time.
It'll be lit and visible
by the flats and houses.
Dodd, you'll be here,
on the east side.
You make your way
from the compound
to the east wall of the club.
The exterior bus network box
and telephone exchange...
is at the top of the building
with the phone lines.
- You'll have eight minutes
starting at--
- 11:00.
It'll be tight,
but I'll do it.
Charlie, I need you
to do something for me.
What, now?
[ Tool Clatters ]
Fuck!
[ Grunting ]
Dempsey, you'll be here
on the southwest wasteland.
You leave at 11:08.
You've got a lot to do.
We need it done by 11:15.
Piece of piss.
[ Scoffs ]
For fuck's sake.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Come on!
[ Grunting, Groaning ]
Okay. Okay.
That's enough.
Go. Go.
Okay.
[ Groaning Quietly ]
Dempsey, you need to be
on your way out of the lounge
by 12 minutes past.
Dodd, that's when
you cue Roper.
4, 3, 2, 1--
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Beeping ]
- That's the club.
- Want me to deal with it?
No. Your man's coming round
to buy weight any time now
and I don't wanna deal with him.
If I don't call
in 10 minutes,
you know the drill.
Hurry up, Charlie,
for fuck's sake.
All right.
[ Arrow Fires ]
[ Arrow Lands ]
Dodd, you rip out the wires
at 11:14.
Rip them from below the concrete
so they can't turn it off
without shutting down the grid.
Dempsey, you need to be
on the ground and finished
with the door by then as well.
- Then I want both of you gone.
- I don't like this bit, Harvey.
Me neither.
It's how it is,
or it all goes tits up.
- Don't know, mate.
- It's how it is.
- [ Alarm Blaring ]
- [ Grunts ]
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Flames Roaring ]
What the fuck!
[ Thunderclap,
Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Harvey On Tape ]
They didn't panic,
they didn't make mistakes...
and they certainly
didn't sell me out.
They had done more than
could have been asked of them.
The next part were mine.
Fancy meeting you here.
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
I'm gonna
fucking enjoy this.
Not too late, am I?
No, Steve.
You're right on time.
[ Thunderclap ]
I'm not gonna use this.
Be like wearing a condom
to fuck a girl you really like.
One step, and you'll
swallow this crowbar.
As if you have the balls.
Won't cost you
to find out.
Go on. Take a swing.
See if it works out.
What are you waiting for?
Come on! Have a go!
You got two choices,
Harvey.
You can either run away now,
and maybe you'll get far enough
I'll never find you,
or you take a swing.
But if you do,
you'd better swing hard,
because if I get back up,
my face, as I bury yours
into the ground, will be
the last thing you ever see.
You're out of
your fucking league!
I fucked you, Harvey.
I fucked you,
and I fucked your little mate,
and there's nothing
you can do about it.
That's not exactly true,
now, is it?
What are you gonna do?
Rip off the club?
It's not mine.
Threaten me with a crowbar?
You think I'm scared, Harvey?
You think I'm gonna apologize?
Beg for your forgiveness?
- I don't want
your fucking apology.
- Well, what do you want?
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
To watch you die.
[ Thunderclap ]
You've not got it,
to kill a man.
Have I not?
Go on then.
Have you got the bollocks?
Have a go!
I'm gonna take you
for everything you've got.
I'm gonna put you down,
and I'm gonna smile
while I do it.
And I'm just gonna let you?
It's already done.
[ Bus Pulls Up ]
Oh, what a shame.
A busload of people.
That takes the arse
out of your plans, didn't it?
Not at all.
You're standing in front of
a business with a busted door,
holding a crowbar.
You're fucked, Harvey.
Don't fuck yourself harder.
Walk away now.
How can I?
I haven't
put you down yet.
And you won't.
You might be a prick,
but you're not
a stupid prick.
On the other hand,
I'm just a hero
acting in self-defense.
[ Groans ]
[ Crowbar Clanks On Ground ]
[ Thunderclap,
Thunder Rumbling ]
Call the fucking police.
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Sirens Wailing ]
[ Harvey On Tape ]
Then the police came,
and I were arrested.
Then I met you.
Steven Roper
sent me to prison,
destroyed my life...
and tried to
murder my friend,
and he was
gonna kill me.
I hope you believe
I were justified.
Now, I'm sure
you're wondering
about the money.
After all,
wasn't that the point?
As you said earlier,
it's a shame
it hadn't worked out,
and you were right.
It hadn't worked out.
Not yet anyway.
So here's the fun part.
How do you get into
the room of a building to
break into a locked safe...
when the building
is teeming with police,
the room is in the basement,
the basement has no windows
and the door
is as secure as a vault?
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
[ Harvey On Tape ]
Like every
good schoolboy knows,
you have to
do your homework.
Charlie, you need to get back
to your first position
as quickly as possible and wait.
You can give me
a crash course in steelwork
if you've got the time.
[ Alarm Continues Blaring ]
â™ª [ Woman Singing
In Foreign Language ]
Can someone shut
that fucking alarm off!
Cabling's knackered. Gonna
have to shut power down at grid.
Just get it done!
â™ª [ Singing Continues ]
Everything in order?
Yeah, looks to be fine.
[ Harvey On Tape ]
As you know, Detective,
everything has a weakness.
You just have to find it.
So you're saying
there's no chance then?
Not a sniff.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to take a piss.
Only went
five minutes ago.
Must be the sound
of running water.
Shame you wasted
your time though, Harvey.
No.
â™ª [ Singing Continues ]
[ Sirens Wailing ]
â™ª [ Singing Continues ]
For Christ's sake.
I had them cut the power.
Come on.
Let's get back up.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
â™ª [ Singing Continues ]
â™ª [ Ends ]
[ Harvey On Tape ]
It's funny to think that
while I were chatting to you...
the safe in the Rise Club
were being emptied of
all his ill-earned money.
There's a couple of reasons
why I'm telling you this.
Being a smart arse
is just one of them.
Another is that you
seem genuinely concerned
for my well-being,
so I thought I'd put
your mind at ease, but...
mainly it's because I need you
to restore my faith in humanity.
You have a choice,
D.I. West.
You could pretend
you never heard this tape...
and let a man you know
deserves it go down
and let us walk away,
or you could alert
the police at the port
and have us brought in.
I suppose I won't know
till we get there.
[ All Shouting, Cheering ]
Hey up!
Fucking hell!
[ Laughing ]
Are you all right?
All right?
Oh, fucking hell!
You took your time!
I thought you'd been
taken to the big house!
Fucking drive, before
they change their mind.
- Everyone all right?
- Better than all right, mate!
We've only gone
and done it!
[ Laughing ]
It's soaking wet.
You would be
if I dragged you 20 foot
through a flooded storm drain.
- How much is there?
- Â£75,000!
Bang!
Whoo!
- [ Charlie Laughing ]
- That's the coffee shop and
four grand each pocket money.
- It's all down to you, mate.
- Bollocks. It were all of us.
[ Dempsey ]
Well, that's true,
but all the same--
Your math is on its arse,
by the way.
20 grand four ways
is five grand each.
- I think Nicola
deserves her cut, pal.
- What are you on about?
Think you just talked your way
out of police custody,
no extra boost?
Was the money and heroin found
in Roper's office the only thing
tying him to the robbery?
There was fingerprints
on them.
And how did
they get there?
- Steven.
- Hey, what?
Can I have a word?
In private.
What's that?
I'm paying you
to leave Harvey alone.
There's a grand there.
I'm giving it to you
for Harvey's protection.
Don't want your money.
Could work out another
line of credit though.
Please, Roper.
Just take that money.
You know, if I were you,
I wouldn't give a bucket of piss
for Harvey's future.
I'll drive you home.
That's a lot of money,
and it's a rough area,
and I'm a gentleman.
- [ Engine Starts ]
- I took the notes
with Roper's prints on them,
stamped them at club's tills
while I were in there
and added them to the rest.
I used the print-covered
cellophane to re-wrap the gear
we stole from Roper...
before we planted it
in his office.
Clever, eh?
You're not the only one
with bright ideas.
You let Nicola
go to see him?
Hold your horses!
- When I said other people have
bright ideas, I meant her.
- Why didn't you tell me?
She wanted to keep you safe
and out of jail,
but she didn't want you to think
that she'd changed her mind
about seeing you again.
So why are we portioning her
some of the money then?
Because she's full of shit.
I spoke to her for five minutes
when we went to
pick up a pizza last night.
Apart from prints,
two things came out
of the conversation.
One: She thinks you saw her
get out of Roper's car
two nights ago. Did you?
Yeah. I knew you'd have
called it off if I told you.
I didn't know what she were
doing, but I knew she wouldn't
stab us in the back.
It's good you trust her,
because the other thing that
came out of the conversation is,
she's still got it bad for you.
-What did she say?
-With a bird, pal,
it's not so much what they say.
- It's how they say it.
- All right, how did she say it?
Do you want me to do you
a fucking impression?
Just phone her, you ponce!
[ Line Ringing ]
[ Phone Rings ]
[ Beep ]
[ Harvey ]
Thought you said
you wouldn't answer.
Well, I suppose
I'm a good liar.
You should watch out
for that.
[ Stop Button Clicks ]
[ Clicks Off ]
For a while there, I thought
we were never gonna see
that shit-eating grin again.
What can I tell you?
Looks like it's gonna be
a beautiful day.
