The 2nd principle
is never, ever leave
a mission.
Nothing is insurmountable.
All Algerians
all
have to contribute to
revolution.
Within two days, you
will be released.
_ and also here in Paris.
_ How?
You convince anyone.

Have you heard?
Mom is right.
If you're a villain,
nobody respects you.
Bandit?
Who is a thug?
I?
In this country, it has
money, you're nothing.
Your brother is free.
I'll be free
when my country is.
We must be free.
And things change.
But you talk about?
Want to change everything
with these workers?
Listen, now we are three.
Tomorrow, we'll be all over the neighborhood.
Our cause is just.
He's right.
See the victory of
Vietnamese.
The Americans were more
armed and did not help.
Could get 15 or 20 years.
They never win.
A revolution is underway.
Nothing can stop it.
Listen.
I've thought a lot.
I know how to make money.
It's easy.
Listen to me.
You've been in Indochina.
You know your weapons.
You were in prison,
became resistant.
We three
do not fear anybody.
We will not stand in misery ...
for life.
Let's get it.
I swear.
You must choose.
Which side are you on?
With his brothers or
with your enemy?
My brothers?
I know you.
They do not.
I'm not supporting the enemy.
Are you with me?
Messaoud?.
Good luck.
I left the army.
I'm with you.

Zohra, take the cake.
Now, hold them.
Stop, wait.
My brothers. Listen.
Our struggle and
die in our country.
You must join the FLN.
The FLN's armed struggle.
The FLN controls everything.
She keeps the guerrillas.
The revolution, it is.
The dialogue does not lead to anything.
The French cheat
elections.
No politics here.
Remember.
Remember, my brothers!
Remember, FLN!
_ FLN!
_ FLN!
The French cheat
elections.
_ FLN

This morning we were two.
And yet we are only two.
Look at these pages,

Get there.
Patience.
_ What are you looking at?
_ you.
Why hang up?
I'm talking to you!
All of you ...
Listen to me.
We must bring the war here.
Join the party
promotes armed struggle.
Listen, you.
The only legitimate party
is the MNA.
Got it?
You are mistaken,
my friend.
The MNA will go nowhere.
The MNA trust in elections.
The French give us a vote.
10 votes against the settlers.
They falsify the elections.
Only through armed struggle
we will win.
Abdelkader!.
Out!
Put it out.
Let me! Let me!
Let me!
So you're the FLN?
I heard him say:
Life in the MNA.

Will say or not?
Thus you worse
things.
I'll show.
Look, be careful
Want to die?
Nobody does this to me
Let me go!
I have only one thing to say.
Do not put your feet over here.
While I live
FLN will not be here.
I'm the boss.
You were lucky.
The next time you
will be killed.
Close the door.
Not hurt?
No, okay. And you?
Okay.
They beat you.
Okay. It was nothing.
What do we do?
Hey, brothers?
What do you want?
I'm on your side.
Can I talk?
I received a letter
of our country.
The commanding FLN guerrillas.
I'm with you.
You know him?
No.
But we won one.
Take it.
You'll kill him with it.
Exit. Get out, sir.
So you're back.
You're not afraid.
"Because of the accused deny the
authority of the FLN,
and publicly deny the
need for armed struggle.
On behalf of the Algerian people
and revolution,
the accused is convicted

Sit!
You came with a lot ...
Alone, you would not dare.
Come on.
Give me that and hold it.
Long live the MNA!
