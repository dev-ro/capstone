- Good.
- What does he say?
- The English are running away, sir.
- Ha! Throw in the German tanks.
Attack! Quickly!
Use the ninth tank division. Immediately.
- Well?
- A complete rout. We're pushing them here...
- I know. What else?
- Only Tobruk is still holding out.
- There's a considerable unit there.
- We'll have Tobruk in a few days. What else?
We should regroup now -
to Alexandria, over Alamein or to Cairo.
Alexandria, Cairo - nonsense. Suez.
We're pushing through to Suez. Suez.
Suez - the key to the Middle East.
With the British in full retreat,
nothing stood in Rommel's way
but the tiny garrison of Empire troops
cut off in the fortress town of Tobruk.
This is the story of Tobruk
and the men who made up its garrison,
of the fight they made against
the pick of Hitler's troops,
and of the nickname they won with blood
and bore with pride - the Desert Rats.
- Message from the corps signal officer.
- Thanks.
- Barney, the general's waiting for you.
- What's up?
Orders came in from Cairo an hour ago.
The general's laying it out now.
I want these minefields
re-laid by your sappers.
Exactly the same as the Italians, sir?
They had nine months
to find the best locations.
We have nine hours before Rommel attacks.
- Or less, if that artillery is any indication.
- Yes, sir.
- Message for you, sir.
- Thank you.
It's good to see you, Barney.
I need your help.
Cairo's ordered us to take up
defensive positions for two months.
Two months? Can we?
If we stop Rommel tomorrow,
I'll tell you better.
And now if I may have
your attention, gentlemen.
In order that there may be
no misunderstandings,
these are our present defence positions.
Our first line of defence,
using much of the old Italian perimeter.
Our second line.
Colonel White's supporting artillery...
and our inner fortifications.
Now, Rommel is preparing to attack.
The most logical place to strike is here.
He sends his tanks in,
pushes up this corridor
and, with his infantry, fans out
and creates havoc with our inner defences.
Therefore, our plan of defence
is based chiefly on the belief
that Rommel will attack here.
You will have the honour of being the first
to expose the blitzkrieg for what it is:
a highly limited tactical manoeuvre.
I propose to let Rommel's tanks
come through here unopposed.
You infantry commanders will stop
all German infantry here at the perimeter,
leaving the tanks
to proceed up this avenue alone.
Colonel White will have moved artillery
to line both sides of this avenue.
Across here, we are already digging positions
for the captured Italian fieldpieces.
So... the longer we hold our fire,
the deeper Rommel's tanks
will advance into this box,
and the easier they will be to destroy.
- Am I right, Barney?
- I most certainly hope so, sir.
That'll be all, thank you, gentlemen.
- Tea?
- No, thank you, sir.
Well?
So they want us to hold on for two months.
If those tanks get in our inner defences,
we shan't be able to evacuate.
It'll be a wholesale slaughter, sir.
- Interesting, isn't it?
- Yes, fascinating.
- How many men are in the officers' pool?
- Too many.
Four more came in today from that battalion
that was wiped out on the Derna road.
I need an infantry captain
with battle experience.
I have one.
Been out here a year. Twice decorated.
Name of MacRoberts.
The reserve company I asked for
a week ago has just come in.
They're at the docks now.
Green or not, I must put them into the line.
- What?
- I've got to do it.
Detail MacRoberts to them as an adviser.
That's the best I can do.
Very good, sir.
I'll get him down there right away.
- Captain, Captain.
- What's up? What is it?
- Captain MacRoberts, sir?
- What is it?
- Orders from headquarters. Colonel White.
- What are they?
Temporary duty with an Australian
company. They're at the dock now.
Australian company?
What do they want me to...
Never mind. Find my sergeant.
Donaldson - he's in there.
And leave me your torch.
Get out my way!
- These your men, Lieutenant?
- Why, yes, sir.
Then get 'em under control.
All right, you men, break it up!
Form up here! Fall in!
- Come on!
- I'm sorry, sir.
- One of the men fell in the water...
- I don't care.
This is an assembly area. You'll have
the military police down here.
Company! Attention!
Ready for inspection, sir.
- This the best you can do, Sergeant?
- What do you think this is? Bush week?
- Straighten that line!
- Who is this bright-eyed...
Shut up, Mick. You're just asking for it.
- Better. Where's your commanding officer?
- Down the dock, sir.
Let's find him.
- But the...
- Shut up!
Get your head down.
- The man was seasick, sir. He...
- That's right, sir. A very weak stomach.
He's tight as a tick. Look at him.
Mr Bartlett, sir.
Tammy.
Little Tammy MacRoberts.
What are you doing here?
I was about to ask you the same thing, sir.
- You all right?
- Perfectly. Not a care in the world.
- We'll take care of him, sir.
- No, he can't march in that condition.
Put him in my car.
You'll find it up there on the street.
- I'll give you a lift, sir.
- It's a pleasure, I assure you, Tammy.
- Thank you.
- Pete, Rusty.
Right. Easy, boy. Easy.
- All right, let's find your captain...
- Currie, sir.
- Tom, give us a bit of help.
- Come on. Lift him up here.
In with him, Pete.
Comes up smellin' like a rose every time.
He'll ride and we'll walk,
and that ruddy captain'll
turn out to be his long-lost son.
Where'd you get it, Jim?
- Must be a shell splinter. Get his coat off.
- Stand back.
- What are you men doing?
- We have a man wounded.
You'll have more if you
let these men bunch up.
- He's hurt bad.
- Let the medics handle it.
- But he's my best friend.
- Get these men out of here.
Take cover!
- Now get out of here!
- Move out at the double!
Come on, move! And spread out!
At the double!
Keep moving, there.
Noisy show you're running.
That fool could have had
his whole platoon killed.
Don't be too hard on him.
After all, it's only his first night here.
He'll never see another if he doesn't
learn about Rommel's artillery.
You're still impatient.
You haven't changed much, Tammy.
Well, I suppose I haven't, either.
You haven't got a little nip
of something, have you?
- It's all I've got.
- I could have done with something stronger.
Ugh. What on earth is this?
Desert water. You'll get used to it, sir.
No one but a camel could get used to that.
Yes, and I wish you would stop "sirring" me.
You know, in our positions
it's a little embarrassing.
- How did you get into this?
- I suppose the way I get into everything.
A schoolmaster with the nickname
of Blind Tom doesn't last long.
I got an idea I might find
greener pastures in one of the dominions.
Unfortunately, I picked Australia,
where it appears everyone volunteers.
I made my usual mistake of being
in a pub the day war was declared,
- and on a wave of beer suds, I...
- You might at least have got a commission.
Commission? I'm the perfect private soldier.
No worries, no responsibilities.
- I can't even be demoted.
- Don't believe that for a minute.
Being an infantryman is
the toughestjob in the army.
Let me get you a transfer, sir.
I know a staff officer...
No.
It's good of you, Tammy, but no.
I'd only mess that up too.
And don't you worry about me.
You've got your own job.
All right.
There's your new home.
There's one thing you might like to know, sir.
At school... we all thought
you were the best of the lot.
When sober.
Good night, Tammy...
Uh, good night, Captain.
And thank you, sir.
- You'll need two feet more.
- Two feet?
You'll wish it were ten
when the mortars drop.
When you finish, put the dirt in sandbags
and camouflage the position with brush.
Anything else...
sir?
Yes.
Save that water. That's all you'll get.
Cheerful sort of a bloke.
What's an English officer
doing with Aussie troops?
The last time I heard,
we were still on the same side.
Now, listen, stow the chatter, mate,
and get on that banjo.
- What's your field of fire, Mr Carstairs?
- Full 180, sir.
- Better clear for a full circle.
- Behind us?
Yes. The Afrika Korps is not
committed to frontal attack.
- Yes, sir.
- Ammunition?
The men are bringing it now.
Better get plenty.
That's practically your entire air support.
Bit free with the rough side
of his tongue, your pal.
Yeah. I must have a word with him.
He's right about 'em getting in behind us.
Let's get it cleared away.
- All right.
- On your feet, digger.
- General von Helmhotz.
- Coffee. Helmholtz!
The weather observer has something.
Schmidt! Put it down here.
High-pressure area here,
low pressure here. Easterly wind.
- And this?
- Sandstorm in the direction of Tobruk.
- Sandstorm? Sandstorm.
- Yes, sir.
- A strong sandstorm.
- Thank you. You can go.
- The tanks attack with the storm.
- Pardon, sir?
Use the sandstorm. Immediately. Go!
Ulrich!
That's a sandstorm all right. Moving fast.
Right.
Roger. It's a sandstorm all right.
5,000 yards out.
- Will they attack under cover of it?
- Wouldn't you?
Get me Colonel White.
Yes.
I see. Thank you, MacRoberts.
Same thing, sir. Sandstorm.
Mm-hm. He'll come in with it.
It may even work for us.
Tank men can't hear anything.
Now they won't see much either.
- What's up?
- Tanks! I hear them!
Tank! D'you see it?
There's more than one of them.
Carstairs, sir. Tanks moving across our front,
bearing 65 degrees, about 1,000 yards out.
- Have you double-checked that direction?
- Yes, with the perimeter observers.
Doesn't look as if
they'd attack where we thought.
No, it doesn't.
Tell your commanders
it may be necessary to shift our forces.
- And get Colonel White here immediately.
- Yes, sir.
Remember now,
you're under orders not to fire!
If they don't attack here,
my guns will be useless.
- And it will take me time to move them, sir.
- Uh-huh.
- Mechanised equipment ready to move.
- All right, hold them.
Yes, sir.
Sir, don't you think we'd
better shift along with them?
Nope.
They're turning. Coming down on us.
Now remember, hold your fire!
Column's turning! Coming in!
- Coming right over us.
- Get that gun off!
Under here, Tom.
Tom, get under here!
Tom, what's the matter with you?
The old man was right after all!
- Attention. Alert your artillery, Barney.
- Yes, sir.
- Let me know when the tanks fan out.
- Very well.
- What about fire discipline?
- Haven't fired a shot yet, sir.
There's two machine guns that
we can see, sir. But there must be more.
Tanks passing C Battery, sir.
Within range of the Italian guns.
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.
Range 500 yards and closing.
Yes, sir. Hold fire!
Range 450 and closing.
Hold fire.
On target! On target!
- What are we waitin' for?
- Orders.
Yes, I know.
They're still coming in, sir.
Almost on top of the Italian guns now.
- Release them to fire.
- Yes, sir. Open fire.
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Tell headquarters to send an antitank gun.
- Yes, sir.
- Get your reserves out and ready to move up.
- Right.
Harry, look!
There's somebody out there.
It's Captain Currie. He's alive.
The dirty...
- They're going after him.
- I need three men.
Cover us.
Look at that, sir.
- Why is he leaving that position?
- He's going after the captain.
That idiot. That fantastic idiot!
He's left that position wide open.
- Take enough reserves to hold it.
- Yes, sir.
You heard him. Let's go.
What about that antitank gun?
- When they can pull one out of the line.
- Too late.
What was that New Zealander's name?
That major.
- Fitz...
- Fitzgibbon. Fitzhugh.
- Fitzhugh.
- Find him.
Tell him we need that gun.
I'll try to get up to the perimeter.
I'm with you, skipper.
You shouldn't have
left your position. Get...
- Skipper?
- Harry, look!
- Of all the flamin'...
- What is it?
The machine gunner must have copped it.
- We must get to that position before they do.
- Let's go.
- How many men have we got?
- There should be two more over there.
Hey, Ginger! Bill!
- Right here, Blue!
- When we go, you go!
Right-o.
When you're ready, Captain.
Oh, you little beauty!
Oh, bless you, Fitzgibbons or Fitzhugh
or whatever your name is.
There's Carstairs, sir.
I reckon the old man must have bought one.
- Get up to the position.
- Right. Let's go!
Come on!
- Gotta be the first one, Captain.
- Yes.
Traverse left. Traverse left.
Traverse left.
Up a bit.
On target.
Agh!
We'll take care of him, sir.
What about your hand?
Position secured. Our tanks and carriers
have chased them into the desert.
- A beaut shot on the tank.
- Thanks.
- You got ammunition going up?
- Yes.
I've asked headquarters
for replacements on our casualties.
- I want him put in for a decoration.
- Yes, sir!
I want court-martial charges
prepared on Lieutenant Carstairs:
leaving his position
against orders and under fire.
Yes, sir.
- He got the old man killed, didn't he?
- The captain got himself killed.
He was there. Why didn't he go?
It was the company commander's job.
He's not the company commander.
Ah, not then he wasn't. He is now.
Yes, he is. And whether you like
him or not, he's a good soldier.
Then let him soldier with
the king's flamin' guards.
He saved your stinkin' neck
today, and the position, too.
Ah? Now I hear he's
court-martialling Carstairs.
- What about that, Blue?
- I wouldn't know.
- The CO's boy.
- Why...
- Sergeant Smith?
- Yes, sir.
- Did you get the men to the position?
- Just moving up.
Come on, get going. Come on, move.
If any man goes to sleep out there,
I'll have him shot.
Get goin'!
There'll be none of that here,
or I'll tear you apart with me bare hands.
Break it down, Bluey. I was only thinking.
Never mind thinking. You're a footslogger.
Now get moving.
- Captain?
- Who is it?
Oh, you, sir.
- How's your hand?
- Burning like brimstone. But how are you?
I found a very deep hole.
If you can dig deep enough,
only your pride gets hurt.
- Look, let me get you a transfer...
- No, no.
Don't say it again.
I'm afraid I might take you up on it.
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- Oh?
Harry Carstairs.
There's a rumour that
he's to be court-martialled.
It's no rumour.
I forwarded the papers tonight.
But why, Tammy?
It was a natural and courageous thing to do.
Certainly it was.
But that has nothing to do with it.
He disobeyed orders,
jeopardised the position.
- But he's just a boy...
- We've no use for boys here,
- particularly not as officers.
- You can't be much older than he is.
I don't know whether I am or not.
I do know that I've been here a year.
And one of the first things I learned was
that this isn't a game for children.
Men get killed and stay killed.
- I know that.
- I don't think you do, sir.
Only a line officer knows
that any decision he makes
may involve somebody
being killed or wounded.
His job is to follow orders
and make decisions
without letting sentiment, loyalty,
friendship or anything else interfere.
When he can't do that, he might as well
get rid of whatever he's got up here.
He's no good to himself
or anybody else any more.
- That's a pretty cold estimate, Tammy.
- Perhaps it is, but it's the truth.
They'll just try to knock out
our supply convoy in the harbour.
- How do you know?
- I'm just guessing.
- Would you sooner get in there?
- Yes.
That's all there is to it.
Now, what's all this concern for an officer?
I thought you were a confirmed private.
I like him. He's honest, fair to his men
and, for a young man, very understanding.
- Did he let you off a couple of work details?
- Maybe, but he's done other things.
He gave me the bottle that was responsible
for my... condition the night we docked.
- So that's what's behind it.
- Well, no, no, not all.
It was the reason he did it.
Because he knew I was a coward
and that I'd fall apart without it.
Come off it, sir. You're no more of
a coward than anybody else.
Yes, I am. You noticed itjust now.
I'm frightened to death.
Well, all of us are afraid part of the time.
- You'll get used to all this.
- No. No, I won't.
I get sick, physically sick,
and I want to run anyplace just to get away.
But that's not right, sir. You should get
a medical discharge. The psychiatrists...
No. I'm afraid of that, too.
You don't know much
about real fear, Tammy.
Maybe it comes with age or the bottle.
You don't know what it is
to be a coward. Really a coward.
To know it, yet to hope one day something
will happen to prove that you're not,
yet half the time not
really believing that either.
But I'm off the point
and I'm embarrassing you.
What I really wanted to ask you was
to withdraw the charges against Carstairs.
Withdraw them?
Didn't you hear anything I said out there?
- Yes, I heard.
- Then you ought to understand why I can't.
I know how you feel about him, sir, but...
I can't. No.
Tammy.
Do you remember a long time ago your
coming to my study before a final exam?
The time I thought I was going to fail.
It seemed a terrible thing to me
at the time. Ruin me for life.
It might have.
You gave me a real going-over.
I remember that particularly.
I thought you were worth it.
I think Carstairs is, too.
That was in school, in peacetime,
not in the middle of a war.
Besides, I passed the exam.
I did, didn't I?
Yes. You passed.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, one of the few
real pleasures of rank
is the ability to make promotions in the field.
There's no question of your deserving them.
I congratulate you and I thank you.
Um... yes, that'll be all,
thank you, gentlemen.
Up!
If you gentlemen follow me,
I'll give you new orders.
Congratulations, Mac.
Gentlemen, I have a few matters
I want to discuss with you.
At ease, MacRoberts.
I have here court-martial papers
on Lieutenant Carstairs signed by you.
I also have a request for the dismissal
of the charges, also signed by you.
Yes, sir.
If these charges were as specified, the young
man endangered the entire operation.
- You still wish to withdraw the charges?
- Yes, sir.
You realise that he will succeed
as company commander.
- Sir?
- He's the senior lieutenant.
He'll have a highly competent
battalion commander.
- He'll need one.
- Yes, yes.
As you know, Major,
we're extremely short of field officers.
On White's advice,
I'm giving you the battalion.
You'll assume the temporary rank
of lieutenant colonel.
- Yes, sir.
- Fast-moving war, isn't it, Major?
You'll have three Australian
companies. Congratulations.
- I might have known...
- Uh-uh! Careful, Colonel.
You may have seen the press dispatches
on our defence. I don't like them.
Defence is a state of mind,
and I don't want our troops to think this way.
We're committed to holding
Tobruk for two months.
Unless we take the offensive,
Rommel will overcome us in a week.
- Or less.
- Yes.
We're in no position to mount
a major attack, but we can hit and run.
There are the German positions
as accurately as our intelligence can say.
From now on,
every company on the perimeter
will raid at least one of
these positions every night.
It's up to the commanders to select
the targets, brief the companies
and send Intelligence
a daily assessment of damage done.
- Can you handle it?
- If that's it, that's it, sir.
- But...?
- Well, casualties may be high.
The troops have been bloodied,
but they're still green.
They won't be for long.
I'll look to you to keep casualties down.
Yes, sir.
- That's all, Colonel. And good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck, Mac.
- Yeah.
Well, now what? Hm?
I was just thinking how happy I am
I'm not an infantryman.
Oh.
- We start with those.
- Mm-hm. Right.
I won't lie to you. This is hard, dirty work.
But if it's done and done right, it'll pay off.
The Jerries don't like people
wandering about in the dark.
There's one thing you've got to remember.
If a man is killed or badly wounded,
you've got to leave him.
You can't endanger the rest
of your patrol for one man.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
That's it.
- Colonel...
- Well?
I wanted to thank you
for dropping those charges.
Thank the general.
I had nothing to do with it.
The copy of your letter's in the company files.
Oh.
- Well, I could have made a mistake.
- Maybe you did.
But the thanks still goes.
- Good night, sir.
- Night.
He did drop
the court-martial proceedings.
How do I know?
Maybe the general told him to.
And what about his orders for tonight?
If a bloke cops one,
you flaming well leave him there.
You reckon he'd be so free
with English troops?
Put a sock in it
back there. Let's go.
Night after night,
through May and June,
bands of desperate men
went out from Tobruk
to spread havoc, confusion
and fear among the enemy.
On the vast, dark stretches
of the Libyan desert
they ranged like their ancestors who had
once made England mistress of the seas.
They struck in the darkness...
and disappeared into darkness.
And in the cold light of dawn
came back to their shell-pitted refuge.
Go on. Get a move on, Fritz.
- You reckon this'll make the colonel happy?
- Oh, hysterical.
He might even let us go out
tonight with our bare hands.
Come on, you, get a move on. Get movin'.
You're a difficult man.
Also an intelligent one.
- I think questioning is useless, don't you?
- Definitely, sir.
Take him out, John.
- I regret that I couldn't assist you, gentlemen.
- Come along.
Oh, my.
The minute those clever ones get away
from name, rank and serial number...
I crosschecked eight lies,
and that business of being a tank man.
- His collar tabs...
- Stop taking bows.
Come on. The general's waiting for us.
He's an artillery officer, and Rommel's
moved his long-range guns up against us.
It's obvious.
From what he said -
or from the lies he told us -
I'd bet a month's pay that
that's their encampment.
We thought it might be a rest area, but that
could be a camouflaged gun emplacement,
and that, and that.
This spot that we thought was a firing range
could be an underground ammunition dump.
- Barney?
- Can't touch them.
They're way out of our range.
Could you find out if Rommel
was planning a major new attack?
- Nothing as definite as that, but...
- It sounded awfully like it to me.
No other reason
for moving up heavy artillery.
We'll have to get that ammunition dump.
Commandos can't get in and out in a night.
It's 20 miles from the perimeter.
- If we could get an airstrike...
- No use against an underground dump.
That line there - that's a highway?
Mm. Supply route from Benghazi.
There are still some Italian vehicles
they left behind.
If we took them and broke through here,
where that Italian regiment is holding,
we could drive right down the highway.
And lose your whole expedition.
I'm not so sure.
There must be men who speak Italian.
Of course. And German.
I've two Arabs in my section.
They could lead you across that desert.
Simple. Delightfully simple.
- And has about one chance in a hundred.
- Perhaps.
But what were the chances of Rommel
sending his division in where you said?
Ha!
If your men are as cocksure as you are,
they might get through.
They've had two months of commando work.
They're tired of being shelled 24 hours a day.
So am I.
It's a calculated risk, but then
that's the whole theory of warfare.
- If we broke out here...
- Yes.
.. and you could give us
a diversionary attack here...
All right, fellas, make it snappy.
See you got all your papers ready.
Come on, come on. Hurry.
You new men, remember -
you take nothin' with you.
No identification, no letters,
no pictures of the kids or the old lady.
And don't take all day!
The trucks are waiting.
Tom, that's for the old lady, just in case.
I'll give it back to you in the morning.
There's four months' pay there,
and I'd like to see it again.
Don't worry about the dough, chum.
Just get back here in one piece.
- Tom'll have it for you. Won't you?
- Yes, I will.
Tom's always here, no fear of that.
Just don't take no chances while I'm gone.
- What's the matter, Tommy?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.
I'm sorry.
Yes, come in.
Oh, it's you, sir. What's up?
- I've come to ask you a favour, Tammy.
- If I can do it.
I want to go on this raid.
Honestly. It's important to me.
I believe it is. But why?
I'm the only man here
that's never been on one.
- Are they suggesting...
- It's nothing like that.
It's just seeing the men go each time
and looking after their valuables and letters...
Please, Tammy. I'll try not to disgrace you.
It's not that.
It's just that I...
Well, I need you for something else.
I've just put through a request
for you to be transferred to me.
My paperwork's in a mess.
I need someone I trust on the files.
That's a lie, Tammy, isn't it?
You just made it up.
Well, part of it.
I am transferring you.
This is a rough assignment.
Most won't come back.
- There's no reason...
- You're not to go and that's it!
I suppose, truthfully...
that's what I hoped you'd say.
You're probably right, too.
Look... you'll be four times
as valuable to me in an office
as you would be thrashing about with a gun.
And four times less dangerous.
Mm... pretty girl.
Yes.
Someone from home?
Yes, from Scotland, that is. My wife.
I didn't know you were married.
Or to such a lovely girl.
Not much time for an announcement.
We did it in '39, just before I went to France.
- Have you seen her since?
- A week, after Dunkirk.
- Any children?
- One.
- Little boy.
- And you've never seen him.
- No.
- That's tough.
But all wars come to an end sometime.
This one will too.
If I have anything to do with it... it will.
- Look after these for me.
- Yeah.
If I don't...
I'll see you tomorrow.
And so, on 9th July 1941,
began one of the most daring raids
of the North African campaign.
With their sole objective
a gigantic ammunition dump,
54 picked men jammed into
three captured Italian trucks
and prepared themselves for a wild ride.
30 seconds.
Remember, once that dump blows,
you're on your own.
Never mind anybody else.
Get your men out.
Good luck.
Get that back up.
Easy One to all units. Follow me.
Stay close. Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Looks like a roadblock, sir.
- Slow down but keep rolling.
- Yes, sir.
Easy One to all units. Proceed with Plan C.
Keep moving. Follow us.
Roadblock. Travel orders.
- We're going to the front.
- Your travel orders.
Keep talking.
We have travel orders.
Understand? Orders from General Rommel.
Wait. You can't... Stop!
What happened, Müller?
Crazy Italians.
They don't even know where they want to go.
May the devil take them.
- Keep your eyes peeled for a wadi.
- Yes, sir.
That's it ahead. Pull in.
Give the rest of them room to clear.
The camp is 200 yards down the road.
All those detailed, dismount
and proceed to stations.
Convoy will follow in three minutes.
No contact until you see the flare.
Get going.
Down!
Agh!
Agh!
That's it. Dead ahead.
All right, men, let's get 'em!
Take care of those wounded. Come on!
See if you can get that gun working.
Demolition team!
Quickly now!
Let's have the wire. Quick!
Come on, come on!
- All set, Colonel!
- Clear, everybody!
Come on, come on! Let's go!
Get 'em out of here!
Get moving!
Get moving!
- Ready, Colonel.
- Get in the trucks.
Get in there.
Let her go!
Get 'em out of here!
Get 'em out of here! Oh!
Can't you ever obey an order? Get out!
Shut up and push the ruddy plunger!
Come on! We can still get out!
Carstairs! We can still get out!
We can still get out! Carstairs!
Take prisoners! Take prisoners!
Get me a prisoner, understand?
There!
Over there! There's one of them!
Wet down all canvas!
Leave him alone!
Put six men on that hose!
- You filthy butcher! Keep your hands off me!
- Colonel...
I am a lieutenant colonel!
I demand to be treated accordingly!
If he touches me,
I'll break every bone in his body!
If your wound...
Get a doctor! By the terms of
the Geneva Convention, I'm entitled to one!
Now get a doctor here,
you incompetent clown!
Call the doctor here.
- A doctor will come, Colonel.
- That's better.
There is
a wounded English officer.
He wants a doctor, on grounds
of a... Geneva Convention?
It's called the Geneva Convention!
- You're getting all the time more stupid.
- Yes, Doctor.
I must ask you questions...
When you get a doctor here, I'll be happy
to discuss them, Herr Leutnant, not until.
Couldn't do it without me?
- Are you a doctor or a faith healer?
- Huh?
A doctor. Are you a reputable doctor?
- What does he want?
- He wants to know if you're a good doctor.
I studied in Heidelberg
and with Tosten in Vienna.
- See, sir, the bullet...
- Quiet!
Not too fast.
Quiet. Stay still.
Jensen, a probe.
Passed right at the artery.
A difficult position.
A little higher and it would be a bone splinter.
I hope you roast in the flaming fires.
Just one more moment and...
Brandy, quick.
Drink.
That'll taste fine.
Ready. Good!
Very good, Herr Doktor. Obviously
you got your training before Hitler.
What does he want from Hitler?
Here, Field Marshal.
Doctor!
- Doctor, quickly!
- One moment, one moment, please.
The field marshal is wounded.
Jensen, finish this.
- What happened?
- Damned Spitfire attacked.
- A Spitfire? Nothing trivial.
- Shut up, you!
Quiet.
You have the advantage of me.
- Colonel MacRoberts.
- A pleasure.
He was conducting an attack
on our ammunition store.
Really?
I have not inspected the damage, but from
what I hear you are to be complimented.
Thank you, sir.
My heavy artillery must have interested you.
It was perhaps making life exciting in Tobruk.
Or are we confined to
name, rank and serial number?
- Only when you touch a tender spot, sir.
- Uh-huh.
Well, we will devote ourselves
to general subjects.
Your commanding general, for instance.
Tell me, MacRoberts,
since it is now long past,
was it he who organised the defence
against my panzer attack, or was it Cairo?
It was the general.
If I remember, he described your attack
as a highly limited tactical manoeuvre.
Yes, yes.
It had worked well for us,
but I used it once too often.
- I underestimated your man, Colonel.
- Grave mistake, sir.
Yes.
But he is Australian, and you are English, no?
My intelligence has given me to understand
there was friction between the two.
I suggest some changes in your staff, sir.
It will be interesting to meet this man
the British think so highly of.
- And when will that be, sir?
- Mm?
I imagine whenever I decide
we've had enough of your Tobruk.
That might have been some weeks ago.
Colonel, I fully understand
your natural pride in holding a position.
Since it is the only position the British hold,
I can understand the extravagant claims for it.
Actually it plays very little part in our plans.
Please.
Uh-huh. I'm afraid
my general has other ideas.
I suppose he has,
but even you must be aware
that my forward elements are
within 200 kilometres of Alexandria,
and that within the month
we will have taken Cairo.
- Not until you take Tobruk.
- Now, MacRoberts,
I respect your pride in
this little rat hole you call Tobruk,
but don't insult my intelligence by telling me
that if it stood in my way
I couldn't crush it like that.
Sir.
Normally I would defer to your rank
and the fact that I'm your prisoner.
If you can crush Tobruk, crush it.
But don't tell me it isn't
a constant threat to your supply line,
that it isn't an open sore in your side, or that
you can take Egypt without first smashing it.
Silence, you!
Quiet, Kramm. Let him talk.
This is what keeps you
in those flea-ridden caves?
- That's part of it.
- And the rest?
The rest is that by holding Tobruk
we prevent you from taking the Suez.
And if you don't take the Suez,
I suggest you start planning for the next war.
- Cognac for the field marshal.
- You British pig!
- Lieutenant!
- Stop!
Take it away.
Colonel, you are a brave man,
and, were you not so stubborn, I might
have enjoyed your conversation more.
When I have brought your country to
its knees, it is possible we may meet again.
This gentleman has other ideas.
You are a prisoner of war
and will be treated as such.
- Kramm, take care of this.
- Yes, Excellency.
Thank you, sir.
Quicker, down.
Here, faster, before the planes are back.
Everybody out.
Smith! Good man.
What do you think, sir?
We can't move by daylight,
and we've got a long trip tonight.
I'm for some sleep.
Yeah.
Who's there?
- What is it now?
- I heard something over there.
Move away.
- Ah!
- I'm sure I heard something.
I'd give my stripe for a mouthful of water.
You'll have a bellyful
when you get to Tobruk...
if I don't take the wrong turning.
Well...
Somebody out there.
- Where?
- Down by the wire.
Put a burst over their heads.
It may be our patrol.
Who goes there?
Break it down, you mugs! I had me
flamin' foot caught in the flamin' wire!
It's Bluey!
Stone the crows. It's the colonel, too.
What about Harry? I mean, the captain, sir?
He bought one.
I'm sorry.
If you'd lowered your aim a bit,
you could've got me too.
The heavy and desperate fist
of Rommel fell on Tobruk again and again,
through the Luftwaffe,
massed artillery and frontal attack.
The men of Tobruk had been
asked to hold for two months.
By July, they had held for four.
Through August they held.
September, October...
In Egypt, an army was being rebuilt
during these precious months.
In November...
Our relief column under General Auchinleck
has broken out of Egypt and is on the move.
The general will push
straight across here to us.
Our supply convoy, already at sea,
will arrive here tomorrow night.
I don't need to tell you yourjobs,
nor do I need to tell you this column
will be in vital need of supplies.
I think that both Rommel and I can
promise you a very interesting week ahead.
- MacRoberts?
- Same thing last night, sir.
- On the move all along the front.
- Yes.
I think you'll find pressure
all around our defences.
However, it seems to me that
this hill, Ed Duda, is a key position.
It commands the Bardia road
and our supply road to the harbour.
Consequently, I'll have to
move troops to hold it.
But I can only spare one battalion,
so it'll have to be our best
and most experienced one.
That's it, gentlemen.
We will hold for three days or until relieved.
We will need every round of
ammunition we can carry.
- Start moving the men out right away.
- Yes, sir.
- Any questions?
- Well, I...
I wondered why it had to be us.
We've been in the line the longest...
In the first place, it's an order.
In the second, if it's any good to you,
the general asked for the best
and most experienced troops.
- Is that all?
- Yes, sir.
That'll put the cap on it.
There'll be some choice comment on this.
Come off it, sir. It's only an order.
They may even get a kick out of
the general choosing their battalion.
Uh-huh. And I may even run
for prime minister of Australia.
- What's up, Blue?
- The war over?
- We getting relieved?
- Beer ration?
Don't sit on it until it hatches, Blue.
You gents will be proud to know the general
considers you the pick of the garrison.
- Here we go again.
- Another dirty deal.
Consequently, you've been selected to hold
the key position in the comin' festivities.
- We're moving out.
- That ruddy MacRoberts.
He's volunteered us again.
He's pushing for general.
Here, rally round and I'll show you
the points of interest.
Now, this here's Ed Duda.
The mob's supposed to be coming up from
Cairo, and we're gonna hold it for three days.
They were asked to hold
for three days. They held for eight.
Eight freezing nights of roaring gunfire,
eight blazing days of searching
the horizon for a sign of the relief column.
On the morning of the ninth day...
See anything?
Not a ruddy thing.
Just hold it for three days
and the relief column will be along!
Well, it's eight flamin' days now,
and there ain't a sight of 'em.
Gone back to ruddy Egypt, I reckon.
One more night of this
and they'll take me off in a sack.
- They'll be along in a bit.
- In a bit!
Yeah, in a bit! Always in a bit!
Well, I ain't waitin'! I can't...
Let me up.
All right now?
Yeah.
Give me another tin of grub.
Three wounded and two dead.
Company strength down to 57 men.
About a thousand rounds of small arms
ammo and 23 mortar bombs.
- And C Company?
- Lost four more last night.
Down to 41 men, one officer,
1200 rounds, 17 mortar.
One machine gun completely destroyed.
Take command of A Company.
What about the forward post?
That's where we lost two of our four, sir.
Is it manned now?
Well, no, I...
I haven't been able to pick the men, Colonel.
Four hours is about as long
as anyone lasts out there.
- I thought after they had breakfast...
- All right. Let it go.
- If headquarters sent us replacements...
- They can't.
Rommel's throwing everything
he has round the perimeter.
- Will there be any change in orders, Colonel?
- If there is, I'll tell you!
Change, change.
What are they asking me for?
I don't give the orders, I obey them.
Headquarters told me to hold. I can't!
Get me headquarters.
Let them decide.
- Colonel Orten?
- Yes.
Diamond Red.
Coming on.
MacRoberts here.
It was a tank roadblock,
but they knocked it out.
They're moving now, Mac.
By nine o'clock, Mac. Noon at the latest.
No good, Orten.
You told me that four days ago.
No. We've had it.
We're through.
The first attack will sweep the hill.
- There's a chance we can detach a unit...
- Don't lie to him.
Let me have it.
- MacRoberts?
- Yes, sir?
We can't get anything to you
for at least six hours. Maybe not then.
- I called for air strikes over your position...
- They've been pounded for eight days!
- I'm down to less than a company!
- I know.
All I can tell you is
the relief column is moving.
Maybe one hour, maybe four.
All I can do is release you to make
your own estimate of the situation.
Whatever you do, I'll back yourjudgment.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you for what?
Dumping it back in my lap.
The old army game.
My estimate of the situation.
What else can he do? He's not here.
He can only trust yourjudgment and hope...
That I pull off a miracle
and take what's left of a battalion...
- Make the right decision.
- Right decision...
Jerry artillery moving out
in the desert, and plenty of it.
- Tell the commanders to stand by.
- Right, sir.
Get the artillery. Tell them we want
covering fire when we pull out.
- Call 'em! What are you waiting for?
- Is that what you want?
- Suppose they stand off one more attack?
- Are you out of your mind?
They'll be lucky to have
the strength to march out of here.
- They might, if you asked them to.
- If I asked them.
I might have known it.
Let's forget the old-school-tie nonsense
and face reality for once.
I'm the English colonel that got
their captain and Carstairs killed.
The officer that's whipped them in and out
of these caves for the last nine months.
- They'd rather see me dead than Rommel.
- No, Tammy. You don't understand men yet.
I don't say they love you,
but they do know you.
You're authority to them.
The general, why, he's just a name.
You're the one that's running their war.
If you give the order, they won't like it,
but they're just stubborn enough to follow it.
Uh-huh. And my order is to pull out.
Get the artillery. That's an order.
You know that, if Rommel takes this hill,
the advance could be held up for days.
Quite a tactician. Get the artillery.
- The general said that there may be a...
- You drunken old fool!
I'm responsible for over 100 men.
If I order them to stay, they'll be killed!
It's senseless to ask them for what they
haven't got! I can't do it and I won't do it!
I'm old, I'm a drunk... and maybe I'm a fool.
But I do know what I'm talking about.
Don't take all this on yourself, Tammy.
Everybody needs help sometimes.
Let them help you. Ask them.
No. I've had it.
I can't.
All right.
It's your decision, but if you make it
you'll be no good to yourself or anybody else.
You told me that yourself once.
- Remember?
- Then I'll be no good to myself.
- Ah, Tammy, an hour and...
- Don't call me that!
Tell the commanders we'll move out
in 20 minutes, and that's an order!
Yes... sir.
Devil? Give me Colonel White.
Barney?
I'm pulling out in 20 minutes.
Give me all the covering fire you can spare.
- It's that rough, Mac?
- It's that rough.
I'll put up a green flare when we're ready.
Sir, I think they have an OP
dug in on this first rise.
If that's the case, perhaps
we can manage to get some...
What's the matter with you?
I ordered you to get these men out.
- Where's Bartlett? I'll have him...
- He told us.
But it don't make no difference.
The men won't go.
We ain't going either.
Won't go?
I, uh...
Where's Bartlett?
He went out to the forward
position, sir. Alone.
That'll be him.
- Barrage! Barrage!
- Come on!
Barrage!
In there!
Fix bayonets!
Come out of your holes, you desert rats!
Let's go! You!
- You!
- Come on! This is it!
Come on! Fix bayonets!
Get out of your holes, you desert rats!
You go! Come on! You, you!
What's that?
What about Bartlett?
Hey!
So, after 242 days
ended the siege of Tobruk.
Not the biggest action of the war
and far from the last,
but one in which a sweating, dirty,
hopelessly outnumbered garrison,
by its stubborn courage,
won for itself an unforgettable place
in the world's history of battles.
