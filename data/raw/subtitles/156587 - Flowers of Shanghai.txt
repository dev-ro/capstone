In the late 19th century...
Shanghai's most elegant
brothels...
were found in the city's
English Concession.
They were called
"Flower Houses."
"AII Fortunes!
Three Great Fortunes!"
Why do I keep losing today?
If you lose, you have to drink!
I won't accept defeat!
What? Empty your cup!
"AII Fortunes!
Two Together! Five Champions!
"Five Champions!" It's a tie!
Neither of you won.
Then they should
both drain their cups!
Good!
Everybody, drink!
This is very enjoyable!
Who's next?
Who's next?
Me.
All right, Luo!
Let's use
the chicken-pattern cups.
Yufu...
"Two Together! Eight Immortals!
Four Joys!
"Two Together!
Three Great Fortunes!
"Three Great Fortunes!"
Drink up!
My young brother Yufu
is new here...
but look how many girls
will drink for him!
Impressive!
"Two Together!" An easy win!
"Five Champions!"
All right... "Eight Immortals!"
Pour wine for him.
Your brother's rather good
at this game.
He's learned from experts!
"Two Together! Four Joys!
Two Together!
"Three Great Fortunes!
Eight Immortals!
"Four Joys!"
Pour wine for him.
You have to drink!
Please, not too much!
Young people always have a way!
Yufu, who is she?
Crystal's younger sister.
Don't you know?
Crystal is always feeling ill.
Her sister is here in her place.
Thank you, miss.
We should let Yufu go.
We can go on playing.
The women all think
he should stop...
because Crystal
is waiting for him.
Have some more wine!
Come on, drink up!
He and Crystal are really
serious about each other!
I've seen besotted couples
in my time...
but none like them!
It's as if they're
stuck together like toffee!
They go out together,
come in together.
If a day goes by
without a meeting...
it's the end of the world!
Crystal asks the women
to track him everywhere.
And if they lose him?
Then she bursts into tears!
I tell you,
I've never seen the like!
That's what love is all about,
isn't it?
What happens
when they're together?
I'll tell you!
I visited him one morning...
and found them gazing
into each other's eyes.
Just sitting there,
gazing at each other!
Not saying anything?
Not a word!
Hopelessly lovestruck!
You know what that's called?
What?
Tell us!
"Mental telepathy"! Let's drink!
Fate has brought them together.
Luo calls it "fate."
I believe in it!
Really? I call it "bad karma."
What?
Notice how pale Yufu is?
He's caught in her trap!
He looks so pale, doesn't he?
One time I suggested a visit
to the opera.
You know what Crystal said?
What?
"The opera's just
a lot of noise. Why go?"
So I suggested to go out
in a horse-carriage instead.
I thought they'd
enjoy looking around.
You know what Crystal said?
"Who wants to bump around
in a horse-carriage?"
And it didn't even end there!
My next suggestion was to go
and be photographed.
Nice idea.
For a souvenir!
You know what Crystal said?
"But the camera will capture
the beams from your eyes!"
Next morning,
I saw her licking his eyes!
Licking his eyes?
With her tongue!
Actually licking his eyes!
This has been going on
for half a month or more!
What a story!
Let's have some more wine!
And the food's getting cold.
Your next dish!
What is it?
A delicacy!
Bean-curd soup!
Bean-curd soup in a sandpot.
What's wrong with Master Wang?
Master Wang has been
calling on Jasmin.
And so today,
Crimson sent her maids...
to beat Jasmin
at the Ming Garden.
I didn't know Crimson
was so vicious!
That wasn't vicious!
I think she was silly
to go to so much trouble.
If they'd damaged her jewelry...
Master Wang would have
paid for it anyway.
And if you'd been Crimson?
Me?
I'm not inclined to tell you.
They're quarreling!
Why don't you call on Cinnamon
and see how I react?
You think I wouldn't dare?
I'd have Cinnamon come out
to give you a beating!
You're saying this
to impress Master Hong?
All of your talk is ridiculous.
Why?
As a flower girl,
you have many callers.
So you must accept
that your callers...
will see other flower girls!
What do you mean?
It's simple enough.
We're in business,
so there's no other way.
If you buy my exclusive services
for three seasons...
then I'll see no one else.
Isn't that right?
You mean
you want to leech off me?
If not you, then who else?
Drink! Drink!
Master Zhu, I challenge you!
That is what I call a party!
FLOWERS OF SHANGHAI
Huifang Enclave
CRIMSON
Master Wang,
it was your mistake.
If you'd been frank about it...
you could call on as many
other girls as you like.
But you weren't frank!
When Crimson found out,
she wailed...
"Master Wang has abandoned me
for Jasmin!"
Master Wang
simply called on Jasmin...
for a cup of wine last night.
And now he's here, as usual.
Master Hong!
Don't blame our mistress
for being upset!
When Master Wang
began calling on her...
she had many other callers.
But they stopped coming...
when Master Wang
became her patron.
We invited them back,
but Master Wang said...
"Never mind if they come or not,
I'll support you myself!"
Master Wang...
those were your exact words!
Our mistress has been very
contented with Master Wang.
She takes no other
gentlemen callers.
You also said...
you'd take care of all
our mistress' debts.
Master Hong...
how can you blame our mistress
for being upset?
There's nothing more to say
about this.
Put Jasmin out of your mind.
Master Wang is here now.
Crimson, you have not lost face.
Let's put this behind us.
Master Wang will buy you
clothes and jewelry...
and he'll clear whatever debts
you have.
That settles everything,
doesn't it?
I don't mind him
calling on Jasmin.
What I mind is the secrecy!
And he's with her
almost all of the time!
Master Tang, I've been with
Master Wang for 21/2 years...
and what you see in this room
is all that he's ever given me.
He's been calling on Jasmin
for only ten days...
and she already has
an entire new wardrobe.
Seeing what's going on...
his friends have rushed
to buy furniture for her.
Master Tang, you have no idea.
This is nonsense!
Flower girls are recompensed
for their services.
Their callers
have no responsibility...
for their other debts.
You're asking too much!
No flower girl relies
on just one caller...
and no gentleman limits himself
to one flower girl.
We can go wherever we please!
It's tedious
to even discuss this!
You're right, Master Hong.
No flower girl relies
on just one caller.
Our mistress has plenty
of other callers.
Why should she rely
only on Master Wang?
But Master Wang
made her a promise.
If he'd kept her promise...
our mistress
would have no complaint.
Now he's calling on Jasmin.
As you say, no gentleman
has to limit himself...
to one flower girl.
Our mistress can say nothing.
But while he
is calling on Jasmin...
our debts remain unpaid.
Consider, Master Wang...
which of us is being "tedious"?
You or our mistress?
All right.
None of this
properly concerns us.
Let's go.
Are you leaving now,
Master Wang?
Jingda!
Master Wang,
you can leave if you want to.
No one will detain you...
but let's make one thing clear.
Jingda and I were up all night
comforting our mistress.
We didn't sleep at all.
Tonight we will sleep.
Women like us are
never responsible...
if our luck turns bad
and we are left penniless.
Master Wang, you cannot blame us
for this situation.
We should leave now.
Stay as long as you like.
I'm sorry you were troubled.
Tomorrow we'll set two banquet
tables to apologize to you.
No need for that.
You were too scared of us
to come alone?
You turn up today
with two friends.
For what reason?
What they said
just made me angrier!
Very clever of you!
Master Wang is not at fault.
Those friends led him astray.
Maybe they were the ones
who led him to call on Jasmin.
He needed no help!
His friends didn't push him.
He found that little chicken
all by himself!
Jasmin is no chicken these days.
She even hires opera troupes
for entertainment!
Master Wang...
how much have you spent on her?
Thousands?
Nonsense.
Really?
Well, Master Wang needn't
bother his head about it.
Smoke some opium.
Ginseng soup for you,
Master Wang.
Azhu, why is Crimson so upset?
What do you mean?
I've promised
to pay her debts...
but she still says
I'm cheating her.
Master Wang
understands very well.
No, that's why I'm asking.
Master Wang, an intelligent man
like you should understand.
Our mistress
has always treated you well.
Why didn't you clear her debts
before now?
Now you say you'll clear them.
But you sound grudging.
How can she accept
if you begrudge her...
for holding you to your promise?
But she's the one
holding a grudge!
Our mistress has nothing
to be angry about.
Sooner or later, Master Wang
will clear her debts for her.
It's all up to you.
But should
your relationship with her...
depend on such trivial details?
Well, should it?
If I don't clear her debts,
she calls me bad.
And if I clear them,
she still calls me bad.
What does she really want?
Master Wang,
do I really need to explain?
Don't get angry.
Just don't get angry, all right?
I'll follow your advice.
All you can say is,
"Don't get angry"?
If you were me,
wouldn't you get angry?
If I were you,
I'd be over it by morning.
Don't cry.
Don't cry!
Gongyang Enclave
PEARL
Master Hong is here.
Where were you last night?
I called on Jasmin,
then went home.
Why is your mother
hitting Treasure?
It's nothing.
Treasure should mind
what she says.
She wants more
than she can have.
Alongside Jade, she's nothing.
There's always trouble
when she tries to compete.
What did Treasure say?
Treasure said...
"Jade doesn't have
her own hookah...
"so Auntie took mine for her.
"She goes out
in my old dresses, too."
Jade overheard this, and refused
to wear the dress again.
This morning she stayed in bed,
saying she felt ill.
That's why Mother
is scolding Treasure.
She's asked me to talk to Jade.
What are you supposed
to say to her?
It's difficult for me.
Just seeing her makes me angry.
She gets a few bookings
and she's so full of herself.
While Treasure gets beaten...
as if she'd only
just entered the house.
But Jade is a real asset.
If you weren't the daughter
of the house...
she might look down on you, too.
Don't say that.
She and I are quite close.
She pays more attention to me
than to Mother.
A booking for Mistress Jade.
Coming.
I just told her...
if she refused to go,
then your mother...
would have to send
Treasure instead.
She rushed off the moment
she heard that.
Well done!
Eat something. You should eat
before we go out.
And you should eat
before you go drinking.
Not hungry, and I should go now.
Then send for me later.
I'll eat, have a wash,
and join you.
All right.
Mistress Pearl, food's ready.
Ask Jade if she's hungry,
we could eat together.
Sister.
Feeling better?
Have some more.
Treasure opens her mouth
without thinking.
She says whatever comes
into her head.
She upsets me, too, you know.
Anyway, you're not like her.
You get many bookings.
Mother likes you.
You needn't be so sensitive.
If Treasure upsets you,
tell me... don't tell Mother.
Does it seem like I'm taking
Treasure's side?
I'm not really.
After all,
we're just flower girls.
All working in this one house.
Some years from now,
we'll all be married.
Even the most popular
of flower girls...
has only a fleeting period
of fame.
Try to look at it that way.
Sister, you think too much.
I'm too ignorant to know
what's true and what isn't.
I'll never blame you
for setting me right.
I just hope you
really understand.
Let's eat.
Shangren Enclave
EMERALD
Do you have any money?
Yes.
Just look at you, at your age!
You still want to keep lovers?
Don't care about face?
Here's some spending money
for them.
I won't take it.
Who else can you borrow from?
Don't worry.
This is the last time.
Thank you, Master Luo.
This is so embarrassing.
At least you realize that.
Why does she need money?
She irritates me so much.
Look at her.
When she has money,
her men take it.
When she doesn't,
she borrows from me.
Scold her about it, and she
pretends not to understand.
A few days later,
she's forgotten all about it.
A booking for Mistress Emerald!
What can I do about her?
Where is it?
Houma Street.
All right.
Who is she seeing?
There are several men.
Some new,
as well as the old ones.
Carrying on like that
at her age!
I saw an old man in the outer
room. Is he one of them?
That's her tailor, Zhang.
How could he be her lover?
That money was to pay his bill.
Where in Houma Street?
The Qian residence again.
It's a mahjong party. They'll
want me to play for someone.
If no one else books me,
I'll be stuck there.
Sometimes I just sit for two or
three hours. It's such a bore.
Then why not turn them down?
I can't refuse a booking.
Auntie would be furious.
She'd scold you?
Definitely.
If I do nothing wrong,
she never says a word.
But one small mistake,
and I never hear the end of it.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Sister.
What is it?
Look.
Your Auntie beat you again.
I've told you,
learn how to flatter!
If you won't listen to me,
you'll get beaten.
But my Auntie isn't like yours.
She beats me
whether I flatter or not.
One man called me
several times...
and I was accused of
flattering him too much.
That's why she beat me
this time!
Didn't you follow my advice?
I said exactly
what you told me to say.
"If you want me to entertain
callers, don't beat me!"
That made her lock me in
and tie me to the bed.
She asked me
if I dared to refuse a booking.
So tell her you do,
and let them beat you.
I couldn't stand the pain.
I had to give in to her
to get away.
If you're afraid of pain,
you should be...
an official's wife or daughter,
not a flower girl.
Is there any opium?
There's a chestful over there.
How can anyone swallow it?
It's so bitter!
Some people take it raw.
It must ruin their stomachs!
So painful!
You're so stupid!
I don't think she'll ever learn.
You know,
last month Master Chen...
threw a banquet for her.
But that was
one whole month ago.
Then she had a caller...
who ordered some food
and wine for her...
but he turned out to be an old
friend of hers, a freeloader!
The clerk from
the foreign goods store.
He came after dinner
and stayed past midnight!
You see why Third Sister
beats her?
No tips from serving wine,
and no outside bookings?
That one banquet was the lot!
No more in prospect.
So her total earning for the
month was one foreign dollar!
You expect your Auntie to live
on the northwest wind?
Well, do you?
You want to have outside affairs
and treat nonpaying callers?
You're wasting your breath.
You're useless!
You deserve to be
beaten to death!
Otherwise you'll go on
losing money!
Stop it.
Get her out.
She makes me so angry!
Where is all this bad luck
coming from?
East Hexing Enclave
JASMIN
Sixteen foreign dollars
is too much?
Too much. Ten is about right.
Give him ten,
or twelve at most.
The best-value emeralds
are in Temple Market.
Then I'll trouble Master Hong
for the emerald jewelry.
That's fine with me.
Qiao!
Coming.
Bring hot towels,
clear the table.
Yes.
You have some, too.
I don't want to.
It's addictive.
I won't be able to work!
It's not addictive.
Crimson smokes it,
and she's no addict.
Crimson has many callers,
why would she care?
Even if she gets addicted,
she'll be fine.
Actually,
she has very few callers now.
How do you know?
I saw the books.
Aside from me, she's had only
twenty or thirty bookings...
all from old callers.
That's enough,
considering that she has you.
You don't understand.
She supports her whole family.
She needs a lot.
How much do they need...
if the whole family
shares one small room?
Unless she spends
a lot on herself.
She doesn't spend much.
She takes a horse-carriage
every few days.
That's not so expensive.
So where does the money go?
How should I know?
You suggested she spends a lot!
Tell me what she spends it on.
I have no idea
how Crimson spends money.
Don't call on her
and tell her I said this.
If you do, she'll think
I'm talking behind her back.
Don't worry.
I won't say anything.
You and Crimson have been
together for 3 or 4 years now.
What can I tell you about her
that you don't know?
You're so naive!
Crimson is always vilifying you.
And here you are, helping
to cover up her problems!
When I began calling on Crimson,
she told me...
"A really good gentleman caller
is every flower girl's dream."
"Now that we have met,
I need no other caller."
I told her she could stop
being a flower girl...
and marry me if she wanted.
And she was quick to agree.
But she was just humoring me.
She said we could marry
if I paid all her debts.
So I paid them...
and then she said her parents
didn't approve of the match.
Master Wang is kind to come
when he's asked to.
It proves our banquet table
still has legs!
Mistress, you have me to thank.
It seems she doesn't
want to marry me.
I can't tell
what she's thinking.
Master Wang, please smoke.
It's such a trial for you
to come here!
Not one of our stupid servants
prepares your pipe for you.
I don't need anyone to.
Have some tea, Master Wang.
The jeweler gave you this
to look at?
Yes. Sixteen foreign dollars
for a hairpin!
It must be cheaper
at Temple Market.
You already have hairpins
like this.
You can buy them
for someone else...
why can't I buy a pair
for myself?
Of course you can, but you
already have several pairs.
You could buy something else.
I will buy something else.
Frankly, I don't need
another hairpin.
But I'm angry,
so I want to buy a pair...
just to waste sixteen more
of your foreign dollars.
Then take sixteen foreign
dollars and buy something else!
There's nothing special
about these hairpins.
Nothing special about me,
either, so they suit me.
You're not serious!
Mistress Crimson is known
throughout Shanghai!
Am I still a mistress?
I'm less than a wild chicken!
I can't be called "Mistress."
Sister, Jade and I
must have been enemies...
in a previous lifetime!
We've just quarreled again!
She's still saying
bad things about me.
I can't stand it!
She wasn't talking about you.
Of course she was!
That's why Auntie threw me out!
All right, I give in.
I'll never say another word
when we're in Auntie's room.
Satisfied?
What is the matter with you two?
Stop it!
Treasure, go to your room.
Jade, sit over here.
I've told you many times
not to argue with her.
You know she isn't too bright.
Pearl.
Master Hong.
Luo has set a banquet table
in Emerald's rooms.
Let's go there later.
All right.
Jade, please leave us.
Honest flower girls
are so devious these days!
You all drink together.
You must know what I mean.
Which girl
are you talking about?
You all sit around
a table drinking...
but Young Master Zhu slips
an emerald pendant to Jade...
under the table.
And then Jade asks me
not to tell you.
So why are you telling me now?
I advised her to tell you!
I said it would make you
more eager to help...
if she ever needs a favor.
Jade is doing very well now.
So maybe it's time
she got married.
You can be her matchmaker.
You can do it. I'll help you.
Master Hong, your invitation.
Mistress, Master Wang is here.
Mistress.
I heard!
Am I wrong to call you?
You have no callers and you're
brimming with jealousy.
Don't you want to eat, Mistress?
Azhu.
We haven't eaten, either.
Order some dishes.
We can eat together.
But you've been drinking,
you must have eaten.
We really haven't.
Mistress,
shall I order for you, too?
I don't want to eat.
Master Wang, if you're hungry,
order for yourself.
Mistress hasn't even
had a sip of tea.
I'll get her some congee later.
Liang, bring some tea.
Master Hong.
I'll leave first.
Master Hong, are you going?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing!
I want to talk to you.
Come over here.
If you want to talk, then talk.
I don't want to see you
unhappy all day.
Every time I come,
you're unhappy.
You know how upsetting it is
to see you like this?
Don't be like this,
if only for my sake.
I'm unhappy, that's a fact!
What do you want me to do?
If you don't like it...
go somewhere
that you can be happy!
I'm being patient with you,
and you're so rude to me.
I said nothing when you came.
Not a word to offend you.
And all you can say
is that I look unhappy.
Now you say I'm being rude.
I think you're the one
who's being insensitive.
How can I be happy?
I see, it's always my fault.
If I behave like this again,
you might as well beat me.
But don't be like this.
Come here, I have something
to discuss with you.
Thank you.
Ham congee.
Don't wait for me.
Master Ge,
time for a drinking game.
Let's play.
"Two Together, Two Together.
"Five Champions.
"Four Joys, Four Joys."
You lost!
Have something to eat!
Let's play again.
Come on, now.
"Two Together, Two Together,
Five Champions!"
Drink up!
Your next dish...
Good!
Mistress Pearl and Mistress Jade
from Gongyang Enclave are here.
Spring rolls,
bring more spring rolls.
Master Wang, please eat more!
Jade, Young Master Zhu
is asking for you.
Shuren!
Please.
Who is that?
Shuren... he's Zhu Airen's nephew.
Master Hong,
have a game with me.
All right, come on.
You two are well matched.
I'm not so sure about that.
Here's the wine.
"Two Together, Two Together,
Five Champions!"
Got you!
I lost.
A rare occurrence!
Shuren, let's play.
I don't know how.
What is there to know?
Come on. Good.
"AII Fortunes! Eight Immortals!"
Lost again! Shuren...
Come on, one more time.
"AII Fortunes!"
"One Win! One Win!"
Drink up.
Once again!
"Five Champions!
Five Champions!"
Lost again!
Master Luo lost two in a row!
Not in form tonight!
Come on, come on.
One more time. He can't bear
to lose, play once more.
"AII Fortunes!
Three Big Fortunes!"
Let me drink for him.
Sorry, I've spilled it.
Never mind, wipe it up.
What's that?
Take a look, Master Luo.
You know what it shows?
Yes, it's the "wine rack"
(a scene from "Golden Lotus").
Don't discuss it with him!
He's immoral!
You're wrong.
It's not the "wine rack"!
What's amusing all of you?
Put that away,
or you'll be scolded.
Master Luo.
Did Emerald tell you
she wants to buy her freedom?
Yes, but it seems she can't.
No girl who wants to buy her
freedom announces the fact.
She announces it
when she has it.
Frankly, what I want
is the business she brings...
not her person.
If I don't let her go, she'll
be in no mood for business.
So I may as well let her go.
So why did she tell me
she can't do it?
I wouldn't want to
criticize her, but...
as you know,
Emerald is a mischievous girl.
In this business, I buy in girls
when they are seven or eight.
And I bring them up until
they're old enough to work.
I pay for their food
and clothes.
I teach them everything.
But not all of them
make the grade as flower girls.
Emerald is clever,
and she's helped a lot.
She recalls that I originally
paid 100 dollars for her.
Now, 10 times 100
is only $1,000.
Master Luo, really...
there's no comparison
between the original price...
and her value now!
So she says 1,000.
What do you say?
I'm guided by my conscience.
Go to the teahouse and see what
other people think about this.
Her bookings alone amount
to $1,000 per season.
Not counting her tips
or the gifts she receives.
Master Luo,
even if you paid me $3,000...
it would balance
only one year's earnings.
And she could still earn a lot
as a flower girl.
Isn't that so, Master Luo?
Look at Silver Phoenix here,
for example...
Girl! Where is your mind
wandering now?
Just look at her.
A girl like Silver Phoenix
gets no business.
Should I pay for her meals?
I should pay her $100
and let her go!
A Shanghai flower girl
can be worth 3,000 or 1,000.
There's no fixed value.
If you don't ask for too much,
I'll make it worth your while.
We can be partners,
and both of us can do well.
Master Luo is quite right!
I'm not demanding 2,000.
I'm sure that we can come
to a satisfactory arrangement.
You're back!
Think it over, Master Luo.
I will.
Is Silver Phoenix asleep?
No!
You look dead on your feet!
Not at all.
I was listening to Auntie.
Did she really drop off?
Auntie hit her. Don't mind her.
Leave us alone.
Auntie was discussing the fee
for your freedom.
She wants 3,000.
I urged her to reduce it.
And I'll help you
with some of it.
We can sort this out together.
It will be fine.
Who asked you to pay?
I have plans of my own.
You needn't be involved.
3,000?
We'll see.
All Aunties are calculating
by nature.
My Auntie is a self-made woman.
She bought herself a few girls.
We didn't cost her much!
Take me. I've been working here
for five years.
She's got nearly 20,000,
just from me.
And my dresses and furniture
are worth at least 10,000.
She'll keep all of it.
But she still demands 3,000!
Fine, 3,000.
If she deserves it,
she'll get it!
Emerald, Master Luo thinks
that your value is $2,000.
He'll pay half of it.
Does that seem fair?
Give me a light.
I didn't realize
you were so wealthy!
If I'm worth 2,000,
bring me 5,000 first.
Where do you think I'd find
so much money?
Come, this is no time
for false modesty.
I thought you were serious
about this!
If my freedom is bought...
I'll need 3,000 for clothes
and accessories to start afresh.
You think 1,000 from you
will be enough?
You want me to starve
once I leave this house?
So you don't want my help?
Of course I welcome your help!
Take care of my clothes
and accessories...
and I'll be grateful for any
further help you can give me!
Mrs. Huang.
Forget what we discussed.
Her freedom
is of no concern of mine.
Where is your conscience?!
Just reflect for a moment.
You were orphaned at seven
and came to this flower house.
I sympathized and treated you
like my own child.
I combed your hair,
bound your feet, everything.
Now you treat me as an enemy!
How did I offend you?
You want your freedom
so that you can rise above us.
I wished you success...
so that you could
reciprocate my favors.
And now you treat me like this!
So young and yet so cruel.
You'll come to a bad end!
Auntie, do stop crying!
What does this matter?
I'm in your house...
you can decide
whether to free me or not.
I don't want to buy my freedom.
And if we go on arguing
like this...
they'll hear us next door.
I can make no sense of this.
A flower girl
wants to buy her freedom.
Her patron wants to help.
If Master Luo had other ideas,
he could discuss them with me.
But now you reject his help.
I see. You want all of his money
for yourself!
"Three Great Fortunes.
"Four Joys!" Let's drink!
Losers drink
their own penalties.
All right, agreed.
That's good.
I don't want to see anyone
without a cup in his hand!
Keep the wine coming!
Let me drink with you.
Come on, let's empty these cups.
Good!
Master Zhu is a fine drinker!
Let's play the drinking game.
Come on.
Shall we play as a team?
Fine, you two together!
Master Wang, let's play!
Let me beat him first.
Ready...
"AII Fortunes!
"Five Champions! Five Champions!
Two Together!"
Drink!
You have to drink!
Your turn. "AII Fortunes!"
"AII Fortunes.
Two Together!"
Drink!
He lost!
He lost! Empty the cup!
Master Luo,
you should be drinking, too!
Come, have something to eat.
The food is getting cold!
This fish is straight
from the Huangpu River.
What's going on outside?
What's happening?
I don't know. Go and see.
What's going on out there?
Go and see.
Something's happened.
Let's play another round.
"Two Together, Two Together."
Sorry, I'll drink.
It's nothing.
Drink!
What happened?
Nothing.
It's a mess.
Drink!
They're just checking on
gambling in the alley.
Nothing to worry about.
Just checking on gambling.
No need to worry.
There's been an accident
in the alley!
What?
Someone has taken a bad fall,
that's all.
Someone's had an accident!
What? Fell down?
Go and see!
Someone had a bad fall.
We should go and see.
Master Wang, please slow down!
You scared me.
You could have fallen!
Where's the mistress?
Downstairs, I think.
Master Wang,
you've drunk too much!
Liang, bring a hot towel.
Master Wang!
Master Wang!
Master Wang has dozed off.
Master Wang!
Master Wang, what are you doing?
Please calm down!
Master Wang, don't be angry!
Master Wang!
Don't be angry, Master Wang!
Take care of these matters
for me.
Congratulations, Jasmin!
It's good that you
marry Jasmin now.
But you do still have some
obligations to Crimson.
What obligations?
You are Crimson's only caller.
She relies on you completely.
If you don't call,
she'll have no one.
Bills are served
at this time of year.
She'll have many expenses.
Her parents, her brother...
they all have to eat.
If you punish her too much,
it may kill her.
You may now consider
Crimson's life worthless...
but we started out calling
on her for pleasure...
and it shouldn't now
come to this.
Pleasure shouldn't just turn
into vindictiveness.
You're on their side, are you?
Don't be silly.
Why should I side with them?
Then why should I call on her?
I warned you when you
first called on her...
that it had no meaning.
You didn't listen, and you
let the relationship grow.
Now you're furious with her...
and you accuse me
of being on her side!
What can I say?
So why should I call on her?
I'm not asking you
to call on her again...
just put in an appearance!
Why?
I'm thinking of you! What if
something happens to her?
They'll be relieved
if you just show your face.
Just to see how they're coping.
You've been calling on her
for four or five years...
spending so many
foreign dollars.
You can't leave them facing
those small seasonal bills now.
If you help her settle
those bills, she'll survive.
You need never call on her again
if you don't want to.
Master Wang and Master Hong
are here.
We never expected to see you
here again!
Our mistress has been
so anxious.
She'll be so relieved.
The downstairs staff
are all worried...
that Master Wang
has turned against our mistress.
I told them
not to speak such nonsense.
Master Wang was furious.
That's the only reason he's
been blaming our mistress.
Deep inside,
he knew our mistress...
wouldn't have an affair
with an actor.
I don't care
if there was an affair or not.
It's not important.
Crimson.
If Master Wang weren't here,
you'd be complaining.
Now he is here,
and you're silent.
Liang, bring hot towels.
Azhu, bring hot towels.
Immediately.
Mistress, shall I have
the table cleared?
Jingda, clear the table!
I've never seen you so angry
in all the years I've known you.
A prosperous flower girl
might have an affair...
with an opera actor.
But am I prosperous?
How could you imagine
I was having an affair?
You could torture me to death
with accusations.
But I'd die
with a clear conscience.
If you say you didn't,
then you didn't.
It doesn't matter.
My parents gave me this body.
But everything else in these
rooms came from your generosity.
Even if you broke all of it,
it wouldn't matter.
If you want to abandon me,
my only option will be death.
One blue crystal bracelet.
One pair of
cloud-pattern earrings.
One pair of blue chrysanthemum
pearl earrings.
One pair of inlaid-gold
jade earrings.
One jade bat-pattern pendant.
One embroidered silk blouse,
maroon, with phoenix pattern.
One embroidered silk skirt,
black, with flower pattern.
One embroidered silk blouse,
black, with cloud pattern.
Zhao.
Woolen items in total:
Two large trunks,
two medium and two small.
Cotton items,
with or without linings:
Ten trunks, all accounted for.
Emerald, this has been
a long day for you.
Auntie, please sit down.
I'm leaving your house, but you
will always be my Auntie.
I'll always be
Auntie Huang's girl.
Our fortunes
will always be entwined.
We'll both do well.
You are capable in business,
widely respected.
But you should choose
better male friends.
This is my last word
on this subject.
Have more respect for yourself.
You're over fifty.
Don't make a fool of yourself
with young men.
If you buy a new flower girl
for 1,000...
you won't need to buy
her clothes or jewelry.
Golden Phoenix will be very
popular two years from now.
At least as popular as I am.
And so you'll prosper.
That's right.
Silver Phoenix is useless.
If anyone wants her, let her go.
But Golden Phoenix
will be a great success.
Take my advice, Auntie,
and you'll do well.
Right, that's absolutely true.
The other things I said
weren't true?
Of course not!
At my age, I know good advice
when I hear it.
I can hear them arriving.
I'll go down.
Master Luo,
don't trouble yourself.
This is the last time
I waste words on her!
If she wants to be sad
and lonely, so be it!
It's not easy
to run a flower house.
And you've always
criticized her openly.
None of the seven flower
house owners in her group...
is any good.
If I made any mistake,
she'd beat me.
Surely not.
Look at Golden Flower.
I've met three of
those flower house owners.
Golden Flower's Auntie
is kinder than ours.
She doesn't
beat her girls often.
The girls in this house beg
to be put out of their misery.
Tell me one flower house owner
who is good!
Good people wouldn't be
in this profession!
Madam, I'll read it to you.
"This contract of employment is
hereby rendered null and void...
"by Miss Zhang,
known as Emerald.
"She has paid 1,000 taels
of silver.
"No voice of objection
has been raised."
- All right?
- Yes.
"On this day
of 6 October, 1884."
Please give your fingerprint.
Yeah!
I'm next.
Here, see?
Correct. You, too, Madam.
Here, please.
Emerald, here's the agreement
and the receipt.
Please check them
for any mistake.
Master Luo, at your leisure.
Please check them for me.
Terrible calligraphy!
It's a standard agreement,
no mistakes.
It's all right?
Yes.
"Dragon"?
Is that someone's nickname?
He's one of her boyfriends.
Looks kind enough...
but he's always really devious!
He never fooled me.
Please check once more.
Splendid! Well sung!
Everybody must drink!
Master Wang is being promoted!
He'll be moving to Guangdong.
Let's all drink to Master Wang!
Congratulations, Master Wang!
May you enjoy continued success!
Please let me be your host
tomorrow evening.
We'll come!
It'll be in Qingyun Enclave.
Your flower girl is Laurel?
None of us knows her.
She's new to me, too.
A friend of mine introduced us.
So you call on her!
No penalty limits
when we play tonight!
Master Zhou, let's make a team!
"Two Together! All Fortunes!
All Fortunes!"
Drink up.
"Two Together! Two Together!"
Everybody, drink up!
Now you and me.
"Two Together!"
One man, one cup... that's right.
It's going to be a great night!
Master Wang, happy tonight?
If Master Wang is happy,
so are we all!
Master Luo puts it well!
The best thing is his promotion!
Where's the wine?
Let's all toast
Master Wang again!
Together!
Good fortune, Master Wang!
Come back to see
your old friends in Shanghai!
Don't forget us!
You must come back!
I'm most grateful
to Master Wang...
for introducing me
to this position.
It was nothing.
Master Wang,
you need a fresh pipe.
Have some tea.
Liu, bring a hot towel.
Immediately.
Master Wang, these will
take away the bitter taste.
Clean the pipe.
Master Wang, your towel.
Master Wang, Crimson's mother is
the only one attending her now?
Jingda left her
and hasn't been replaced?
And she's moved to a smaller
house, is that true?
I don't know.
Please smoke.
Master Wang has left?
Yes.
Why did Master Wang
seem so depressed?
It's not Master Wang's fault!
He's going back to Guangdong,
promoted.
Why should he be depressed?
Master Wang liked Crimson.
When Crimson proved untrue,
he married Jasmin.
But Jasmin wasn't true to him,
either...
and so he went back to Crimson.
His heart has been in turmoil.
How was Jasmin untrue?
Just take my word that she was.
Is it true that Master Wang
beat Jasmin?
Yes, he beat her hard
and abandoned her.
She took raw opium after that,
but we saved her life.
Master Wang's nephew
was sent away.
The whole affair was hushed up.
Jasmin was too audacious!
Crimson would be so amused
if she knew about it!
A booking for Mistress Jade!
A booking for Jade.
I must get back to work.
Please stay, Master Hong.
Jasmin was well off
with Master Wang!
Why have an affair
with his nephew?
If Master Wang weren't leaving,
he could start calling on Jade.
That reminds me...
Mother asked me to discuss
something with you.
What is it?
Jade started refusing callers...
when she returned
from Shanjia Gardens.
We asked why...
and she said Young Master Zhu
had promised to marry her.
We couldn't bear
to disillusion her.
Can you ask Young Master Zhu...
if he really wants
to take her as a second wife?
If not, please tell Jade
so that she can return to work.
Jade is such an ambitious girl!
Both of them must be dreaming!
Even if Young Master Zhu
weren't engaged already...
how could Jade expect
to be his first wife?
What's that about being
a first wife?
Why do so many flower girls
want to be first wives?
Crystal thought of nothing else,
and she died.
And then there was Celandine,
and she failed.
And now there's another one!
Have you finished?
You've forgotten
the lesson of the hookah.
You'll never be a match
for Jade.
Young Master Zhu,
take some rest.
I want to talk to you.
What about?
In July,
at the Shanjia Gardens...
we were talking,
just like now... remember?
I remember.
You remember what we said?
Tell me!
We vowed to be man and wife,
didn't we?
We said we'd die together
if we couldn't live together.
I knew you wouldn't forget!
I've brought something.
What is it?
One cup for you and one for me.
Drink it!
What's in it?
Drink it!
Help! Help!
Somebody! Help!
What's happened?
Jade, what's happened?
Did you argue?
What happened?
Quick! You drank this?
What is it? Opium?
Quick! Qiaonan, come here!
You cruel and terrible man!
You vowed to die with me!
I'm taking you to hell!
Did you drink any of it?
Quick,
rinse your mouth in water!
You believe what callers
tell you? You're so naive!
It's always nonsense!
Rinse your mouth!
Even if Young Master Zhu
weren't engaged...
he'd never take you
as his first wife!
First wife?
He vowed to die with me!
My uncle arranged
the engagement, not me!
I had no say!
You pig! You're already
engaged by your uncle!
Why don't you die?
Which medicine? Quick!
Drink this!
Why did you do this?
Quick, drink it!
Quick, take the medicine!
Put it there, I'll help myself.
If he doesn't die, why should I?
I won't die before he does!
Such nonsense!
Take the medicine!
Help her take it.
Uncle.
I told Jade Master Zhu
arranged the engagement.
The young master
was not to blame.
And I told her it doesn't matter
if she's first or second wife.
She can marry the young master
anyway, I'll be matchmaker.
But she refused!
What on earth is she thinking?
Who has she been listening to?
Certainly not us!
Our advice would be...
to work hard,
not create scenes like that one!
I think that what Jade did...
was half because
of Young Master Zhu...
and half aimed at Treasure!
You may be right!
Shuren, did you once say...
that you'd give Jade
whatever she wanted?
Yes.
Then let me help you
resolve this problem.
It will cost you at least 8,000,
at most 10,000. Can you agree?
Yes.
Good,
then bear with me a moment.
I'll think of a solution.
How, Uncle?
Don't ask.
If it works, I'll tell you.
Be patient.
Pearl,
please tell Jade he'll pay...
5,000 for her freedom
and 5,000 for her dowry.
Everyone can agree to that.
What do you think?
It might not work.
I think it will!
The Zhu family is very rich.
Young Master Zhu,
please stay for dinner.
Azhu, order some dishes.
Young Master and I
will dine here.
Yes.
Put it to her,
see what she says.
All right, I'll try.
What did she say?
Everything's settled,
as you predicted.
5,000 for her freedom,
5,000 for her dowry.
Jade is afraid of
looking ridiculous...
if things don't work out
as agreed.
Never mind! I'll take all
responsibility in this matter.
Then I'm sure all will be well.
Reassure her again.
Shuren, everything's settled.
5,000 to pay for her freedom
and 5,000 for her dowry.
Jade's "face" stays intact.
Your side spends a bit of money,
everyone's happy.
Who will she marry, Uncle?
Don't ask, nothing's harder
than arranging a marriage.
Anyway, you can leave it to me.
Uncle, who will she marry?
I told you,
marriages are hard to arrange!
Be grateful
that we've found a solution!
Be patient!
