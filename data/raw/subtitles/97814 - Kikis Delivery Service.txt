Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and
Nippon Telelision Network present
Now the latest weather forecast
for northwest Koriko.
Skies are clearing up,
thanks to a high-pressure front...
moling in from the continent.
Mild winds will be
blowing in from the northwest...
clearing out the clouds
by this evening.
We'll also have
a beautiful full moon tonight.
Tomorrow - fair.
Day after tomorrow - fair.
More news in just a minute.
First, a word from today's sponsor.
Jiji, I'le decided!
I'm gonna do it tonight!
Mom!
Oh, hi, Miss Dora.
It's gonna be completely clear tonight.
I heard the weather forecast.
There's gonna be a big full moon.
Did you borrow your father's radio
without permission again?
It's okay, isn't it?
Happy to see you, Miss Dora.
Mom, my mind's made up. It's tonight.
Weren't you going to
put it off a month?
But the next full moon
might be on a cloudy night.
I want to make sure I leale
on the perfect night.
Kiki, wait!
My, my.
What's this lealing business?
It's one of our old customs.
At 1 3, a witch leales home
for a year of training.
Your little baby is 1 3?
My, my. Time flies so quickly,
doesn't it?
I'm afraid so. But nobody
leales home that young anymore.
I remember perfectly well...
the exact day
you arriled in this town.
A little 1 3-year-old girl
came down from the sky...
riding a broomstick, her eyes shining.
I thought you were a bit full of yourself.
But Kiki still has much to learn.
She hardly knows any of my potions.
After I'm gone,
who will make this medicine?
Sign of the times, I'm afraid.
Elerything changes, bit by bit.
But I hale to say,
nothing works as well for my rheumatism.
You're always telling me to hurry!
Now who's the slowpoke?
I think it's better to leale
with decorum and great dignity.
If we put it off for a month, and I find
some wonderful boyfriend, then what?
We'll neler leale!
I'm worried about this.
Once you'le decided, you can't go back.
Of course. I know that.
Good. It's there.
I'm so excited!
It's like getting a birthday present!
Dad!
I'le decided to go away tonight!
- Tonight?
- Yeah! I just decided!
Well, yes, but what about
our camping trip for this weekend?
Sorry, Dad!
This won't do at all!
Yes. I'll expect you then.
Thanks.
Hi, Mom. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is lealing tonight.
Yes, at midnight.
- Not bad.
- I wish it were a different color.
Witches hale always worn this color.
Black cat, black clothes.
It's not really important
what color your dress is.
What matters is the heart inside it.
I know that haling a good heart
is lery important.
I wish I could show you
that my heart is ready.
Just follow that heart
and keep smiling.
Okay.
Be sure to write home
as soon as you'le found a place.
Dad, can I please take the radio?
Mom, you said I could hale his radio.
- Yea!
- Well, the radio's yours now.
Okay. Now let me hale
a look at my little witch.
You look like your mother
when she was young.
Dad...
would you pick me up like you used to?
Well...
How come you neler told me
you were growing up so fast?
You can always come home
if things don't work out.
Come back to my old room?
No, thanks.
I hope you find a good town.
I bet it's real tough to find
a town to lile in by yourself.
Don't worry. Kiki will be fine.
- What kind of town are you looking for?
- A big town?
Yeah. By the ocean, I hope.
- Wow!
- I'm so jealous of you!
But I'm not going for a good time.
I'll be in training at least a year.
Yeah, but they'll hale discos,
won't they?
- Kiki, it's almost time.
- Okay!
That's the broom you're lealing on?
Yeah. I just made it. Pretty cute, huh?
It's cute, but you can't start
on a broom that's too small. Take mine.
But, Mom, that one's so old.
That's why you should hale it.
It neler loses its way, elen in a storm.
Kiki, trust me.
But I worked so hard on it.
Right, Jiji?
Your mother's broom would be better.
You rotten traitor.
He's right. You can make yourself
another broom when you get settled down.
Be careful.
- Go get 'em.
- Bye.
Go, go, Kiki! Go, go, Kiki!
She still hasn't got the hang of it.
She's well past the lake
and doing just fine.
I'm going to miss the sound
of those little bells.
Which way are we headed?
I think south, to the ocean.
Climb up and turn on the radio.
I don't think I can.

Good elening!
It was.
Newcomer, I suppose.
I must be.
I just left home tonight.
Would you mind
turning off that music?
I prefer to fly without accompaniment.
Is it really hard to get settled
into a place you've never been?
Oh, yes. Lots can go wrong.
But since I'm good at fortune-telling,
I can handle anything.
Fortunes?
In fact, I'le started
telling fortunes about lole lately.
What's your special skill?
I halen't made up my mind yet.
Uh-huh. Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training period.
It'll be terrific
to go home with confidence.
That's my town down there.
It's not big or terribly interesting,
but I like it.
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.
Goodbye!
Disgusting. What a stuck-up cat.
I have to have a special skill.
What was that about good weather?
Don't tell me you are going to...
We'll sleep here
until the storm's gone.
- Won't we get into trouble?
- Not if nobody finds us.
I'm soaked through.
Do you feel anything moving?
This smells great.
Sorry. We didn't mean to fall asleep
in your breakfast.
Jiji, you'le gotta come see the ocean.
I don't beliele it! It's huge!
- It's only a puddle to me.
- Aw, come on.
That one's giant. Think there
might be other witches there?
How would I know?
Let's go!
You all right back there?
Look. A big town floating on the sea.
Just as I hoped.
A clock tower and everything!
What if there are some
witches liling here already?
There may not be.
- Am I gonna like it here!
- It's a trifle large for my taste.
Bless my hourglass!
If that ain't a witch!
Good morning!
Are there any other witches
in this town?
No. Can't say I'le seen
a single one of 'em lately.
How about that?
Let's settle down right here.
- Thanks, mister! Bye!
- Don't mention it!
- Tell me we're not landing down there.
- Of course we are.
Everybody's looking at us.
I know. Smile and make
a good first impression.
Well, you see, I'm a witch.
My name is Kiki.
This is my black cat Jiji.
We'd be honored
if we could live here.
We'd love to live here.
You have a wonderful bell tower.
We're glad you like it, my dear.
Hey, kid, what were you doing
jumping into the street like that?
You almost caused an accident.
You must be crazy,
zooming around on a broom in public.
I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.
You're supposed to obey the law
the same as other people.
What's your name and address?
- Are you gonna tell my parents?
- Of course, if it's necessary.
I have to. You're a minor.
Thief! Somebody stop him!
Stop, thief!
Don't you mole from there!
Kiki.
Wait up!
It worked out pretty good, huh?
Good plan to get rid of that cop, huh?
I was the one yelling "Thief! "
You're a real witch, right?
I saw you flying.
Could I look at that broom?
Hey, Tombo!
Isn't it a bit early for girl hunting?
Hey, you guys, shut up.
Let me look at your broom.
Please? Just for a minute.
I didn't ask for your help.
I guess I have to thank you...
but it was rude for you not to
introduce yourself first.
How old-fashioned.
You sound like my grandma.
Go away and leale me alone!
What a cool witch.
Stay here alone? I don't understand.
Aren't your parents here with you?
No. I'm a witch, so since I'm 1 3, I'm
supposed to be independent.
May I see some identification?
Never mind then.
- Are you going to eat that?
- You can have it.
It's going to be getting dark
fairly soon.
Let's go.
Let's just find another town.
There must be a nicer one.
Lady! Your pacifier!
Lady, you forgot this!
When that baby wakes up
and doesn't find this, he's gonna cry.
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.
- I could bring it down to her.
- What?
The woman with the baby carriage, right?
That'd be a big help.
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.
Let's go, Jiji.
Wow!
Sorry to startle you, but
you left this pacifier in the bakery.
Here you go.
The usual?
Hi! Come on in!
Thank you.
Next!
Thank you. Bye.
Take care.
I must say, I nearly fainted
when I saw you fly off.
That woman told me
to give you this message.
" I got the pacifier you sent.
Thank you! "
I guess I should be going.
Wait!
Where are you going so fast?
I want to thank you.
Come up here.
Sit down and relax.
I'll make us some coffee.
- Thank you very much.
- And this is for you.
I see. You need to
find your own town.
Yes, but people don't seem
fond of witches in this town.
There are many kinds of people
in a big town like this.
Take me, for instance.
I like you lery much.
Found a place to stay yet?
You should hale told me
you hadn't.
We hale a lacant room in the attic
you can stay in.
You'd give me a room?
I'd be happy to.
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Osono.
My name's Kiki.
This is my black cat Jiji.
It's not very clean at the moment,
but it's all yours.
Thank you.
Bathroom and water are downstairs.
- Don't hesitate to ask for anything.
- Thank you!
There's flour everywhere.
At this rate,
I'll be a white cat by morning.
Jiji, come look at the ocean from here.
Shall we try to find another town?
The Freedom Adventurer has commenced
its maiden voyage to Antarctica.
What a snob.
I've decided to stay awhile.
Maybe I can find others like Osono...
who will like me and accept me
for what I am.
How much do you think a phone
would cost to put in here?
- A phone?
- Yeah. For my business.
Good morning, everyone.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes!
That smells good. Can I help out?
A delivery service, huh?
I hale one skill - flying - so I thought
a delilery service was a good idea.
Everyone will love it.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.
And you can base the business
out of your room upstairs.
Really?
Thank you.
- I'd like to put a phone up there.
- But a phone costs money.
- I have some saved up already.
- Don't waste it.
Why not use our phone?
It takes time to get regular customers.
If you help around the bakery, you won't
have to pay rent or the phone bill.
I need a lot of help
since I'm expecting a baby.
And I'll throw in
free breakfast too.
Thank you!
I'll do my lery best for you.
You're such a wonderful person!
Jiji, come on! I'm all done!
It's time to go shopping.
Stop jumping out into the street.
We're not at home.
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
I'le neler been more embarrassed
in my whole life.
It was so terrible!
I wish I had something pretty to wear.
Boy, this is expensile.
Kiki, look!
Do you hale any money left?
We'll just hale to eat
pancakes for a while.
Wow! Those are beautiful.
Wait! Pull oler a second!
Miss Witch!
Not flying today?
What'd I tell you?
Black is all she wears.
Wait! Come back! I'm sorry!
I was only kidding!
Perfect timing, Kiki.
A lady wants you to deliver something.
She's your first customer.
Customer? I'll be right back!
The map!
This lady is a customer of ours.
We were talking about
your delilery service.
- You are a cute little witch.
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.
Could you deliler this by tonight?
Yes!
It's my nephew's birthday.
But I can't get there myself
to gile him his present.
Where do you want it delivered?
That's me.
It won't be too far?
I can fly there directly from here.
- How much do you want?
- I halen't really set a price yet.
Is this enough?
This is more than enough.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Oh, wow! That's great!
- I wish I could fly.
- Yeah! Hey, do you know that girl?
How high do you intend to go?
It's my first delivery. I don't want
to be stopped by that police officer.
I was afraid you were going to
deliver it to the angels.
It's just beyond the cape.
Here we go!
I'm liking this town more and more.
I'm not sure what I think.
I'll finally be able to write Mom.
Those are wild geese. Wonderful!
They're flying along with us!
- They seem awfully upset.
- They say a wind's coming.
They also say they're going higher.
Oh, no!
I'm sorry. I... Oww!
Please! I'm sorry!
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs!
I'le neler been so scared.
It's your fault. They warned us
of that wind, but you didn't listen.
You're right.
That's beautiful. They were able
to fly that high up with the wind.
Kiki!
The toy is gone!
Oh no!
We've gotta go back to where we fell!
They're saying,
"The egg thief's coming again! "
What are we gonna do?
Hey! Stop that!
Don't do that!
Stop it!
We're in trouble. They're still upset.
Witches get no respect these days.
Crows used to be witches' servants.
That was a long time ago, okay?
How about we go get it after dark?
We'll never make it in time.
There's only one way to do it.
They'll find out I'm a fake.
After I find it,
I'll be right back to help you out.
- Is that the place?
- Yes. Don't move a muscle.
- Can I breathe?
- Hold it as long as you can.
Yea! Gile me my present!
That's pretty weird.
A bit late, aren't you?
After my sister telephoned,
we were wondering where you were.
I'm sorry.
Could I please have your signature?
Mom, can I put
the canaries in here?
Uh-huh, but be careful
you don't let any of them escape.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Come on, birdie!
I'm gonna put you
in a bigger house!
Please hurry, Kiki.
I know it was here,
so it's gotta be around someplace.
There it is!
Excuse me! Anybody home?
Can you please help me?
Anybody?
Anybody here?
Yeah! ! can't come down right now.
Why don't you come up?
What do you want?
That stuffed black cat
you put on your window sill?
I'm sorry, but it's mine.
I dropped it.
Be good, and don't mole yet.
I found it in the forest.
Would you gile it back
to me, please?
Hang on a minute.
I can't stop just now.
Nice. Very nice.
You're beautiful
just the way you are.
You really should have told me
you were in a hurry.
- I got sort of fond of it.
- I'm sorry.
The stuffing's coming out.
I'll bet the crows did it.
They made such a fuss.
What am I gonna do?
I can't deliver it like this.
Say!
How about we work out a deal?
That's pretty exciting.
And at 1 3 too.
To be independent.
That's great.
- Can you fix it?
- Trust me.
Ketto, time for your bath.
Quickly! The guests
will be here soon!
Ketto!
- I'm done.
- Thank you so much!
You'd better help Jiji
before it's too late.
- But I haven't finished yet.
- You've done enough. Go help him.
Thanks!
Jeff likes my present
more than me!
It is strange, you know.
He adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leale it alone.
He thinks it's a puppy.
Your sister's not going to be
happy to hear that.
- That's okay. I gave it to Jeff anyway.
- Remember to tell Auntie "thank you".
You should be nicer to him.
Jeff is a very old dog.
But, Grandma,
all he does is sleep!
! suppose that's true.
Ketto, go open the door.
Jeff wants to go out.
Be sure to push the door shut
when you're finished.
- Jiji!
- Kiki, what took you so long?
I'm sorry.
That marvelous dog
helped me escape.
He said he'd be happy
to help us out.
Would you take this back in?
What's the matter?
- I'm famished.
- Yeah, me too.
And I'm tired too.
But it sure was
a wonderful adlenture.
And that painter
who found the stuffed cat
wants to do a drawing with me in it.
- Naked?
- Don't be silly!
"Kiki's Delivery Service"
Boring.
Hey! Aren't you supposed to be
minding the shop?
I am,
but nobody's coming in today.
- But it always gets busy around now.
- I know, but I mean my customers.
Jiji, if nobody comes in
I'll hale to eat pancakes foreler...
and be fat, fat, fat!
So, what am I supposed to do?
I think pancakes are superb,
prolided they're not burnt.
You're no help.
When you get fat, see if I care.
Beautiful, isn't she? Somebody told me
she's a fashion designer.
Personally, I'm not very fond
of her conceited cat.
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.
Pardon? Yes, ma'am.
About time we got a customer.
4:30 will be a perfect time
to pick it up.
And the address?
Yes. The blue roof. Right.
Yes, I'm sure I have it all.
Thank you very much.
Hi.
I'll take this one.
Okay?
Thank you very much.
Are you still mad at me?
We're having a party
at the club tonight.
It's called the flying club,
and we'd really like you to come.
Here's your inlitation.
It really is a serious club.
Elerybody would be lery happy
if you came.
May I help you?
They tell me
you hale a delilery service.
Oh. Pardon me.
Yes, of course we do.
It's urgent this package arrive tonight.
Can you do it?
Of course we can...
Are you gonna be all right?
- Uh-huh.
- Can I help you?
Uh-uh.
I'll be back at 6:00,
so make up your mind by then.
How much will that be?
Will that be inside
or outside the city limits?
- I wrote it down on the box.
- The box? Oh, I'm sorry.
Osono!
I got an inlitation to a party
at Tombo's flying club.
Terrific!
You'll have a wonderful time.
But what am I gonna wear?
Kiki, I wouldn't worry too much.
You look fine in that.
It makes you look beautiful
and mysterious.
- You mean it?
- Any work yet?
I almost forgot about it!
It's already 4:00!
Oh, no!
Can you watch the store
'til I get back?
Jiji! Jiji!
Why are you going to this party
when you're so mad at him?
I have to concentrate.
This thing is heavy. Be quiet.
Thank you.
Come on!
Our next appointment is at 4:30.
There's the blue roof.
My name's Kiki. Someone telephoned
for a delilery service, so here I am.
Right this way, dear.
- You're right on time.
- Yes, ma'am.
Madam, the delivery girl is here.
What? Oh, my goodness!
Is it that time already?
- Come, come.
- Thanks.
May I take that for you?
Broom and black cat.
It's just like my great-grandmother
always told me.
My name is Kiki, and I'm a witch.
Oh, and what a cute
little girl you are.
I'm so sorry, but that pie you were
supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.
The temperature
doesn't seem to go up at all.
Something's wrong.
Machines don't work
when they become old like me.
I was hoping you could deliver it hot
to my grandchild's birthday party.
It's one of my favorite recipes:
herring and pumpkin pie.
I guess I hale to admit defeat.
I'll hale to phone her
and tell her I'm sorry.
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.
Bertha!
Would you get her money, please.
Certainly, ma'am.
All of it.
Pay her the amount we agreed on.
- Oh, no. Please!
- Now, don't be silly.
It's not your fault it wasn't ready.
I have no other jobs today.
Maybe I could help.
Does that olen oler there work?
You mean that one?
It used to be the only one I ever used,
but I haven't opened it in years.
If it burns firewood, I can help.
I used to help my mom all the time.
It's a big job to build a fire.
It's a great idea, madam.
I neler did like that electric thing,
and we hale plenty of firewood.
I can build a fire.
Well, I'm not sure,
but if you think you can build it...
But won't this make you late
for your party?
I can't take money for nothing.
Come on. We have to hurry up.
Look what I found. And it works!
You're very good at this, my dear.
Your mother taught you well.
Oh, my goodness, it's so exciting.
Neler did like electricity.
It should be about time.
Yes, lery good. Well done.
And now we wait.
- About 40 minutes or so. Right?
- Exactly right.
- So why don't we take a little break?
- Do you need help with anything else?
Oh! Well,
if you'd really like to...
Thanks lery much.
You're very welcome.
- You're going to be late for the party.
- Stop worrying.
It'll only take me 1 5 minutes
if I fly there fast.
Would you care for some tea?
I just made a pot.
I just remembered.
Won't you be late for your party?
It won't be a problem.
It'll take me 1 5 minutes from here.
But, my dear, that clock
runs about ten minutes slow.
- What'll I do?
- See if the pie's ready.
Bertha! Bertha!
- Is the pie ready?
- It smells fine, so you'd better hurry.
Better hurry! Come on!
- Okay.
- Don't forget your money.
- That's way too much.
- Not for what you've done.
Hurry up, Kiki, or you'll be late!
- Hale a good time!
- Be careful!
What happened
to all that good weather?
My whiskers are tingling.
- Could we get out of the rain?
- We can't! That'll only make us later!
Besides, the food will get cold
if we stop.
Yes?
I have a delivery.
But it's completely wet.
I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way.
But the food came through all right.
I told Grandma I didn't want that.
Grandma sent another of
her crummy herring pies!
Um, would you please sign
this receipt for me?
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.
She can't possibly have been
her granddaughter.
Do you think we can still
make it in time?
Look! Tombo's down there!
We can still make it.
That certainly was quite an ordeal.
That boy waited a very long time.
Doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in these wet clothes.
Kiki, what's wrong?
Do you hale a headache?
Why don't we grab a bite to eat?
I know I'm famished.
Kiki!
Not feeling lery well, huh?
- You have quite a fever.
- Is someone pounding on my head?
I'll bet you neler dried yourself off
completely yesterday.
Am I gonna shrilel up and die?
You have a cold, is all.
I'll bring up some medicine.
And you should eat something.
I'm not hungry.
It'll be better if you eat now.
How about some oatmeal?
Like some, Jiji?
Oatmeal's the best thing for a cold.
There you go.
Don't burn your tongue.
Come and eat your oatmeal
before it gets cold.
Do I hale to eat?
If you want to get well.
That boy was in the shop
a while ago.
When I told him you were sick,
he asked how a witch could catch a cold.
Oh, yes. He said he wanted
to visit you a little later.
Oh, no!
I figured you might say that,
so I politely refused.
You're tired. Just relax and sleep.
I'll just open the window
for some fresh air.
- Osono.
- Hmm?
Um, never mind.
Jiji!
What?
Jiji! Breakfast is ready!
Kiki?
- Feeling better this morning?
- Much better, thank you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I'd olerslept.
That's okay. Come down here later.
I hale a falor to ask of you.
Okay.
"Koppori. " Is that right?
Uh-huh. Is this enough money?
That's all right.
It's close enough to walk from here.
Don't be silly. Work is work.
And be sure to deliler it
to him direct.
Jiji!
- You hale work?
- It's not far away.
Who's your friend?
Lily's her name. I'll be down.
Don't worry. I'll be back in a minute.
Pleasure to meet you, Lily.
Wonderful.
Hey! Miss Witch!
- Taking a walk?
- I'm looking for someone named Koppori.
Hey, that's my name!
Go around that way.
I'll be right with you.
I'll bet Osono planned this.
Gee, thanks a lot.
I want to apologize
for making you wait the other night.
I'm sorry you got wet.
Want to come oler to my place?
I hale something to show you.
Come on! Hurry!
That party was to celebrate
the completion of this thing.
This is the engine
of a human-propelled plane.
Like it?
We're assembling the wings and the frame
at somebody else's house.
I'm planning on flying this thing
during my summer lacation.
Hey! Let's go see where
that dirigible suddenly landed!
"Dirigible"?
You didn't see it on TV?
- I was sleeping.
- Then we have to go!
- We're going with this?
- Why not?
I hale to practice anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.
Okay. Ready?
I'le neler ridden a bicycle before.
Oh, boy! Elen better!
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her relled up. Let's go!
Kick off!
- Should I get off?
- No!
Go faster! Go!
That's great! Hang in there!
Swing your body to the inside
when we go around the curve.
Otherwise it won't turn very well.
Now!
Great! You're doing fine!
Yippee! Great!
- The dirigible, right?
- Right.
We're flying!
Tombo, are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
Does my face look that funny?
I'm sorry, but when we flew
oler that cliff, I was so scared!
I was scared too.
I'll bet you used some magic.
I'm not sure. I was so frightened.
Your poor bike. It's a mess.
Oh, no! Am I in trouble!
- Will you look after the bike for me?
- What happened?
I pedaled too hard!
Wait there!
Sure would be terrific to go around
the world in a dirigible like that.
How'd it make you feel,
the first time you flew?
I can't recall.
I was too young to remember.
But my mom told me
I wasn't scared a bit.
Gosh, I sure wish I was born
into a witch family.
You can just fly away
on a broomstick, but me...
That's all I can do.
I don't find flying that much fun.
It's more of a job to me.
But I think it's wonderful that
you can put your talents to work.
I sort of feel
my confidence slipping.
But I'm glad I came with you today.
I feel better sitting by the ocean.
I could bring you here anytime you want
and train myself at the same time.
- You're a lery nice person.
- You just found out?
I used to think
you were kind of a clown.
My mom says the same thing.
"You clown! Quit looking up to the sky
and get back to your books! "
- Tombo!
- Huh?
- Hey! Guess what!
- What?
Something good! Come here!
I'll be right back. Wait here.
They said we could go inside.
Coming?
They what? Wow! Of course!
Hey, who's your girlfriend?
That's Kiki the Witch.
Come on over, Kiki!
They're gonna show us around
inside that dirigible!
No, thanks.
Ah, come on. It'll be fun.
The delilery girl.
I'm positile that's her.
- You mean she's a working girl?
- My, how independent.
Come on.
I'll introduce you to everybody.
No, thanks. See you later.
What's the matter?
What are you so mad about?
I'm not mad at all.
I have a lot of work to do,
so just leave me alone.
Tombo, let's go!
I think something's wrong with me.
I make friends, then suddenly
I can't bear to be with any of them.
That other me,
the cheerful and honest one...
went away somewhere.
Some friend you are.
Jiji, I don't care
if you do have a girlfriend.
You can't be late for every meal.
And clean up after yourself.
What are you talking like a cat for?
Jiji.
Oh, no! Talk to me!
You mean you can't speak anymore?
Jiji!
I wonder what happened to him.
I can't figure out
a word he says anymore.
Oh, my gosh!
I'm losing my powers.
You can't fly anymore?
Have you lost your magic?
It's become lery weak, so I think I'le
gotta take a break from delilery work.
But I'll work really hard in the bakery,
so please let me stay in my room.
Of course you can stay.
Will your powers come back?
I don't know. Maybe.
I can make another broom, but...
Look!
It's me, Tombo. Did you see me today?
I was waling at you from the dirigible.
The captain took me on the test flight.
It was great!
Hello? Kiki, are you there?
Please don't call me anymore.
What? I can barely hear you.
The captain said he'd like to meet you.
Hey, come on! Don't hang up!
What's wrong?
You don't look like you feel well.
I'm still training to be a witch.
If I lose my magic, that means
I'le lost absolutely elerything.
Kiki!
Hi!
You didn't come pay me a visit,
so I had to come visit you.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I also came to shop a little.
Come on in. I'm done now.
We can take a break.
You'd better beliele I will.
- Nice place you hale.
- Help yourself to these.
- I'll make some fresh tea.
- No tea, thanks. Do you have some milk?
Sure.
Positilely amazing.
The spitting image of
that stuffed cat. You're Jiji, right?
How's the home delivery business?
- That bad, huh?
- I'm not working much now.
I thought you seemed down.
I didn't know things like that
happened to witches.
Why not come and stay
at my place?
Tell your boss you need a break.
They'll manage somehow.
How about it, Jiji?
Rather be with your girlfriend?
Come on! Let's go!
Hurry! The bus is leaving!
I'm bushed!
It's so beautiful here.
Must'le been blind, with two
beautiful girls in front of him.
What do you mean,
you thought I was a boy?
Well, look at the way you're dressed.
Tell me what kind of boy
has these legs, mister.
- Crows!
- We'le become real close friends.
Wow.
Hello, everybody. We're home again.
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I bothered you before.
Make yourself at home
while I get some water.
Like it?
Wonderful.
I got the idea for it
after we met the first time.
But I really haven't got
the girl's face right.
I'le been waiting for you to come back.
- You mean, that's me?
- Yes.
Would you be my model?
But I'm not beautiful.
You'le got a great face. Besides,
it's prettier than it was the last time.
Come on. Have a seat. Right there.
Lift up your head a little.
Look beyond the horizon.
Don't mole. Very good.
Painting and magical powers
seem to be lery similar.
- Sometimes I can't paint a thing.
- You mean it? Then what happens?
Kiki, don't look over here.
Without even thinking about it
I used to be able to fly.
Now I can't elen begin to remember
how I eler managed to do it.
At times like that,
you know what I do? Paint.
That gets rid of my frustrations.
- But still, if I can't fly...
- Then I just stop.
Take long walks,
look at the scenery, doze off at noon.
Don't do a single thing.
Then, suddenly,
I'm able to paint again.
Maybe that'll help.
Trust me. It'll happen.
Come on, don't ruin the pose.
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.
I loled painting.
So much that I couldn't sleep.
Then one day, for no reason,
I became unable to paint.
So I just kept on painting anyway,
but still it was no good.
I realized that I was just
imitating other painters.
Just copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere.
I swore I'd paint my own pictures.
That must've been hard.
But after that...
it's not much easier now.
I think I found what painting means,
at least for me.
To fly, you don't chant
a spell or something, right?
Mm. We fly with our spirit.
The witch's spirit? Perfect!
That's what I'm talking about.
The spirit of witches.
The spirit of artists.
The spirit of bakers!
I suppose it must be
a power gilen by God.
Sometimes you suffer for it.
I guess I never gave witchcraft
much thought.
That talk about discipline and training
was so old-fashioned.
I was so happy that you came
all that way to see me.
Left alone, I would've been
one giant ball of frustration.
There have been many times I've thought
of painting over that painting.
Why? It's so beautiful.
When I saw you today...
I looked at your sad face
and thought, " I'le found it! "
- I knew I could paint you.
- Not fair!
Sure it is.
- Let's go to sleep.
- Okay.
- Sorry about taking your bed from you.
- Don't worry about it.
Can I lisit you
once in a while?
Sure. Anytime during the summer.
And I'll try to lisit you too.
The dirigible
Freedom Adventurer...
recently downed
in a spectacular forced landing...
due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits...
has now been repaired.
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.
Ah, Kiki.
Take plenty of time
and get rested up.
That elderly lady you helped has
another job for you.
Should ! tell her no?
I've told her you'd be away
for some time, but she kept insisting.
Then stop on your way back.
Bye.
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well.
We'le been expecting you.
Come in.
There are less than five minutes
to takeoff now.
- Very nice to see you again, ma'am.
- I'm glad you came.
Excuse me for not standing, but my legs
are bothering me more than usual.
Bertha, bring the package.
Yes!
I hope it hasn't taken off yet.
Not yet.
Bertha's absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.
I'm the adventuresome type.
Turn the volume down.
Kiki, would you open the box?
Yes.
What's this?
Would you please deliver it
to a girl named Kiki?
She was kind
and a tremendous help.
It's my "thank you".
And would you find out
when her next birthday might be?
Then I'll be able
to bake her another one.
Kiki.
I will. And I'm sure Kiki will
want to know the lady's birthday...
so she'll be able
to gile her a present.
You'le got a deal.
- What happened?
- There's been a terrible catastrophe.
Oh, no! The ropes holding
the blimp are breaking!
It's drifting straight toward
our television cameras.
My God, it's going to...
Oh! They always leave me hanging
at the most exciting part!
These winds always come
in midsummer.
They'll be hitting us
pretty soon.
It'll pass by quickly.
Don't worry.
Oh, goody, it's back on.
It's completely upside-down!
The Freedom Adventurer
has been shaken by great winds...
It's like a balloon
in that position.
It has broken loose from its mooring and
drifted into an upside-down position.
A desperate, last-ditch effort is
being made to tie the dirigible down
and keep it from drifting away.
It's extremely doubtful whether
it can be done... Oh, no! It's useless!
That's my friend Tombo
holding on to that rope!
...attached to the end of the cable
as though it were a toy!
There's a young boy
hanging on to the cable!
He's being lifted away
along with the police car!
! don't believe what I'm seeing!
Oh, the humanity!
- Are you sure it's your friend?
- I have to go!
- Be careful!
- Oh, dear. What's happening?
Hold on there, son!
Just hold your grip steady!
Release the helium from the tail!
All citizens are requested
to remain calm. Do not panic.
The helium inside the dirigible
will not explode.
Tombo.
Any word about the boy
hanging on the rope?
The latest report was that
the police car dropped into a pool!
Clear the street!
Get on the sidewalk!
Do not block the street!
Are you feeling all right?
Please, sir,
may I borrow your broom?
- Huh?
- I promise I'll bring it right back.
- Well, I suppose that's okay.
- Thank you lery much!
Fly.
Oh, my goodness!
Straighten up and fly right,
or I'll burn you!
The boy appears safe...
but the dirigible is on a collision
course directly for the clock tower.
If the wind doesn't shift direction...
the Freedom Adventurer
will surely smash into the tower!
We gotta get up higher!
We're gonna hit the tower!
There's not enough helium!
Before we hit, jump onto the tower!
Aye, aye, Captain!
Hey there! Over here! Come on!
- Get out of the way!
- Grab hold of this!
That way! Hurry!
Don't you dare!
That sound
is the helium gas leaking.
The condition of the boy is unknown.
From where I'm standing... Oh, no!
Too much gas has escaped,
and it's falling!
It's snagged on another building!
- Hey, look! Over there!
- It's a miracle!
The boy has managed
to keep hold of the rope!
But how can anyone rescue him now?
That boy is hanging on for dear life.
Something just flew by!
Is it a bird?
No, no, it's a girl!
A witch!
Yes, there is a young girl
soaring through the sky!
Wow! Go, Kiki!
She can fly now!
Get 'em!
Tombo!
Kiki!
Come on!
Be a good broom and help me out!
Hang on, young fella! Don't give up!
Hold on!
She's almost there!
Tombo!
Kiki!
Hold on! Don't give up now!
Don't gile up, son.
Don't gile up! Don't gile up!
She caught him in midair!
I've never seen anything so amazing!
They've landed safely.
What a sight to see!
Everyone onboard appears to be fine.
That broom is mine.
I gale it to her myself.
She did it! She did it!
You're so brale, Kiki.
You did a great job!
Better call the hospital.
I'll be ready any minute now.
Jiji!

We just got a letter from Kiki!
"Dear Mother and Father,
How are you doing? Jiji and I are fine. "
Everything at work seems to be
falling into place nicely.
I'm even starting
to gain some confidence.
There are still times
when ! feel sad...
but all in all,
! sure love this town.
The End
