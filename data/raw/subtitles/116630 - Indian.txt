We had sent Medical reports
ls there any improvement?
What's this? lt has become a big
headache with the Police Dept.
The photographs sent by you shows

Commissioner!
Sir,All the 3 murders have been
committed by the same man!

Moreover,it doesn't match with any
criminal in our records
Could you find out the reason
behind these killings?
They don't have enemies or enemity
to get killed by stabbing!
Okay! ls there any thing common

Same knife!
Even that may also be an old knife
which Mr.Mehta says!
Old knife?

Not only that pieces of animal skin

leather case!
Even that one is also

Look,you too are speaking like

Oh No...
Elder sister?
Ay,you are his lover

Chandru,Who is

lt's not good,give her
the respect
Her name is Medical
sapna College
Oh! Blabbered

Her name is Sapna,a Medical
College student -
There's a fashion show in
her College
They wanted a male
model -
The trousers are in
that room
Please don't rub against me
stand a little away!
They wanted a little help
that's why...
l too had asked for a help
do you remember?
You were not to be seen for
two days -
Not even a
Phone call
Arsu,l don't know how to make you
understand my situation
l have understood
everything
Why are you behaving so
indecent like this ?
Even she is a girl like you
lsn't it -
You are insulting and
sending her
Let's do our work
Work is more important!
You old dog! lf you
are a man come -
lf you are born to one father
then come
Come and stab me
you wastrel!
Come and stab me
You dog,What did
you tell?
Ay,What's this you are
standing naked?
Old man,What happened
became tensed -
This is all a
set up
ln the happiness of getting free liquor
go and sleep in your cell
Sir,suspecting the killer of the treasurer!
We have arrested 20 people
with a great difficulty
Without interrogating
them...
What will be
their age?
They should be between the age
group of 25-45 years
Alright,release
them all
The criminal that we are in search
is above 70 years
Sir,are you telling it after seeing
that drunkard man stabbing?
Selvaraj not only
with that
You may have read handwriting
analysis book,isn't it?
The vibration for the age of this
handwriting is between 70-75 years
Look at this writing
such combined letters -
Way back in 1940's itself this
habit of writing was extinct!
Nobody writes like this in
this Generation
Look at this carefully,its as if
it is printed -
Look at the gap between
every letter
lts uniform
And that too straight
without slanting
This man is neither short-tempered
hasty nor mad
After knowing what the result of the
work would be? -
He plans it
l have to clean this stinking tank
for him to become a Break lnspector
Chandru,Why are you taking
so much time? -
Have you inserted the lace
in my peticoat?
l am doing
isn't it
While you are doing it,tell
me an ''A'' joke
Alright
Shit,he'll not
listen at all
l have cleaned everything you
start the Motor
Hello, should l insert the lace
or on the Motor? -
You,yourself come down
and switch on it
Chandru,That baldy has brought
your lover Blue Cross here -
Run away and
hide
What?
Run away and
hide
What are you
telling?
Run away and
hide
Ay,l can't switch on the Motor
Get lost
This is the vehicle
owner's house
The car that you had asked is
standing over there -
Atleast,now did you understand
that l am innocent -
You hit me for
no reason
Started with a slap now it
has come till a handshake
From now,lt will be love rain only!
Have it
What's this? Algae
rain?
Chandru! How come you
are here?
l am here just like
that
Whose Peticoat is
this?
lts mine
When one is in the house
lt can be worn like this -
lf the temperature goes up,lt can
be folded like this
Chandru,how long will you take
inserting my Peticoat lace?
What are you doing over here?
Nothing for going to Kakinada l
am inserting via Vijayawada
ln one movie,a similar
dialogue comes
What are you
blabbering?
lt comes in that movie
isn't it?
He is inserting a lace in
my Peticoat enough
Chandru,are you a servant
in this house?
Oh God! Don't do it you'll dirty
your hands leave it
Wait,Wait...
You came,broke my glass
now you are going -
What do you think of
yourself? -
Do you know the cost of
this wind shield?
First,give me an answer
and then go
That day on the beach road
you hurt my dog -
You,went without stopping
isn't it
First,give me an answer for that,l'll
give you an answer for this
Wait,l'll see you in
the court
My sweet hearts!
Enough of selling
the ice -
Deposit Rs.8000 for the Car glass
to my mother
Don't get angry
Then what? You told me that
you'll locate the address -
You concealed
yourself
You wore a stupid dress and played
a game with her -
Apart from that you inserted
the lace in her peticoat
Today for her sake you are asking
me to withdraw the case
Chandru,how much can
l tolerate?
lf you register the case,l'll have to
stand in the culprit box instead of that girl
And l'll only have to undergo
the punishment
Chandru,Why for
what?
For you
lnstead of marrying me as broker,l want
that you marry me as a Break lnspector
Aisu,ln this World all the
methods have become illegal -
My father doesn't
understand it
He is not even ready
to help me
l got annoyed and came
out of the house -
l didn't know what
to do
Sapna's father is a
Transport Secretary -
He'll definitely get me a job
if l pay him money
That's why! Right from the house
hold work to the Gardening -
l am doing even without
my liking for it
''Kerala'' State

this skill from my teacher

Aye! Get up!
This won't be enough
for you!
Ay! Do you have
brains?
Why do you torture
this poor animal?
How can it carry such a
heavy load?
How will it be if you are

Are you a
human being?
Why are you shouting at
me like that?
Eating my food and
Playing fowl with me!

a few beatings
For that,Will you

injustice?

Should l file

Will you pay Rs.500 in the
mobile court? -
Or will you pay Rs.150

custody was a big thing for Chandru -
Because of your sullen face even the
animals are in a bad mood
Aisu,l have brought one thing
for you come and...
l don't want the tempo
or anything
You just come and have
a look,come
Ay,Get that Rajasthan
Talkie down
Should we keep its name
as Silo

Only thing is that its lips are thick
and flat like a cattirole -
The nose is airy,but still
its beautiful
Look at its luck
Don't allow it to lick your face! otherwise
lt'll become like a sand paper
What name should
we keep?
Even that is
good
lt's a very good name
an lndian name
We'll push off
decently
Not enough

What's the purpose of your
visit?
You didn't recognise me,that's the
whole problem -
Even l was indulged in Freedom Fighting

Even,l had applied in Delhi for
my Freedom fighter Pension
They had asked for the signatures
from 4 freedom fighters
Madhavan agreed
Mugundan agreed -
Rajagopal who escaped from the gallows
has also agreed!
Even if Senapathi agrees and

A neighbour had set fire

my porridge and was sent off
Before l could come out,everybody
had received their medals
ln the clerical error,my name
had got missed
Please keep all this
inside -
And if you get Senapathi's
signature on this...
First get up,take all this and
leave this place
Somebody had set fire in
the post box -
You were simply standing and watching that & you
call yourself to be a Freedom Fighter -
For this,he should sign on it
Get out
Now,what have l told that you
are getting angry like this?
Does all this not happen in
the World?
ls your husband a real
Freedom Fighter?
Holding a knife in the name
of a terrorist -
He kept stabing the people passing
by and did rowdism
Some news was published about
him in the Papers -
That's why he
did that -
And the rowdy became a
freedom Fighter
Whom did you call
a Rowdy?
Do you know,who
he is?
Do you know,what freedom
struggle is?
