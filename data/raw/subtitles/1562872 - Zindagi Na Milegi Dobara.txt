Will you marry me?
Kabir... please.
Okay.
Will you marry me, please?
Why are you doing this?
Because sooner or later we will.
We love each other.
Our families seem to tolerate each other.
I'm an architect and
you're an interior designer.
We're perfect.
What do you say?
Are you sure?
Natasha, please make it quick...
my knee is hurting.
Yes!
It seems like only yesterday
that Natasha came into this world.
And today she's getting engaged.
Kabir, I'm not losing a daughter.
I'm gaining a son.
You're so filmy, dad.
Harryji
Two years ago you commissioned me
to build your hotel.
Who would've imagined that
one day we'll be a big family.
On behalf of my family,
I welcome you all.
Thank you so much.
Did you ever know that you're my hero
You're everything I wish I could be
I can fly like an eagle
Cause you're the wind beneath my wings
You're the wind beneath my wings
- That was lovely.
Hello everyone.
I am lmran.
Kabir and I have been friends
since school.
The three Musketeers!
That's right, it was the name
uncle had given the three of us.
The three Musketeers.
Unfortunately, the third musketeer...
Arjun is not with us anymore.
Don't worry, he's alive.
He just isn't here right now.
Anyway, Natasha...
Kabir is one of the nicest guys ever.
So, if you ever smash his BMW,
don't worry.
Good excuse to get a new car.
He's also very intelligent.
So leave the kid's homework to him.
You're a true friend, thanks.
You're welcome, bro.
He's very large hearted.
So, don't think twice...
just buy those diamonds.
Basically Natasha...
Kabir is a solid guy.
Put your hand in his and
walk with him.
Because no matter what...
he will never let you down.
- So sweet.
- Hear, hear!
Thank you.
You can send the cheque now.
Tanya...
thank you.
Let me warn you...
Nikhil is planning a
full power bachelor party.
Too late.
His school friends have planned
a bachelor holiday.
A road trip...
through Spain.
- A road trip?
- Don't ask.
They had made some pact
in college that...
each one would choose
an adventure sport...
Are you serious?
Like Fear Factor?
Exactly!
And the other two would have to do it.
So, what have you picked?
That I can't say.
Not in front of me, at least.
You see...
the sport we pick
is a surprise for the other two.
Shut up!
- Seriously.
- Are you kidding me?
No.
That ensures none of us back out.
Whose idea was this?
Mine.
Three weeks.
You know how these boys are.
Not Kabir.
Oh please!
All guys go crazy at bachelor parties.
In fact...
Nikhil still hasn't told me
what happened at his.
I don't know.
I heard something about
your bachelor party.
Who told you?
So it is true.
Does Natasha know?
No man, why would I tell her?
Please... don't tell her.
She was from Ukraine.
- Bloody hot!
- Nice.
I was sloshed.
Okay, listen...
If Sameera finds out about this,
she'll kill me.
I know, don't worry.
It was my last night as a bachelor.
You know I'd never do it otherwise.
I understand, don't worry about it.
- Please.
- It happens.
Sameera!
Sorry, I couldn't resist.
- Take care, man.
- See you.
Trust me, this trick never fails.
What do you mean?
Well, you tell people you know
something about them...
and before you know it,
they tell you their secrets.
Shut up!
You didn't know about the Ukrainian?
No, he just told me.
Mind blowing!
- Yeah, well time equals money, Simon.
You want money, stop wasting my time.
Sell 50,000 June contracts!
50,000 and don't screw up
my stop losses this time!
How much?
Damn! That's horrendous!
Sell it. Sell everything.
Listen Joe, if you continue to give me
bullshit fills like that...
I'm going to have to trade
my Ferrari in for a Ford Fiesta!
We have white and gold and...
tonnes of champagne.
And...
- the centre peice.
- This is nice.
Finally!
Kabira!
Sorry man.
You have no idea what's happening here.
And you have no idea
what a nice party you missed.
I'm sure, man.
Listen...
I've a problem.
I can't make it to Spain.
- What?!
Arjun, you promised!
I know but...
I thought this deal I'm working on
would come through...
- but I'm stuck.
I can't believe you're ditching me
on my bachelor trip.
It's not that...
- Then what is it?
We had decided to do this together.
If you can't make it,
I'm calling it off.
Don't get sentimental.
It's my work!
I'm not.
It's been cancelled once before,
so let's do it again.
It's fine.
It's either the three of us going
or none at all.
Hey...
Hi.
How are you?
Good.
Looking good,
you've been working out?
Yes.
I usually come in the morning.
I was going to call you.
Then why didn't you?
I'm getting married.
- That was quick.
- Arjun, please!
All the best, Rohini.
- Arjun, it's me again.
- Don't ditch me.
- I know why you're making excuses.
- But it's been four years
for that incident.
- I'm getting married now.
- Even today, I only have two friends.
- We're the three Musketeers.
All for one, one for all.
Have you thought about...
what we spoke?
About what?
Are you moving back to Bombay?
Ammi...
I like Delhi and living on my own.
And this trip to Spain...
is it a coincidence or
did you plan it?
Why don't you just say
what you're really thinking?
Fine.
Do you intend to meet Salman?
I don't know.
Imran, why don't you trust me?
It's not about you Ammi.
- He is my father.
- He's your father?
Has he ever called you
or tried to find out how you are?
Maybe he did and
you kept it from me.
Until recently I wasrt even aware
that he is my father.
Alright.
Do what you want.
But please remember this.
Faisal was your only father.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
I can see you.
I miss you, baby.
Now we can see each other everyday.
I'm only going for
three weeks, Natasha.
What will I do in London all alone?
You'll shop.
And in three weeks I'll come to London
to carry your shopping bags.
- Very funny.
- I know.
- I don't see Madrid in this plan.
- Because it's not there.
- We travel to Spain but
we're not going to see the capital?
- We don't have enough time.
- We can't change it now.
- I think we should.
Look who's here!
- Welcome! How was your flight?
- Hello.
Well...
it flew.
Funny!
- Good to see you.
- You too.
I'm sorry about Abu.
I got your email.
- How's Ammi?
- She's fine.
It's not easy to get over these things.
How've you been?
I'm good.
Pretty good actually.
I've a new apartment.
Three bedrooms, big space.
Nice.
I can't believe we're together again.
- Yeah.
- Finally!
Should we sit?
So, here is the plan.
First...
we go to Costa Brava,
which is my choice.
Then Arjun wants to go to Seville.
And then we'll head to...
Pampalona which you've chosen.
Tomorrow morning we leave for
Costa Brava.
What are you doing with the laptop?
I'm looking for an address.
Hola Kabira.
Kabira...
Your treasure.
Brilliant. Thanks a ton.
What have you done to this?
Dude!
First of all, be thankful that
I bought this 12,000 Euro bag for you!
What?
Here... show, show...
12,000 Euro for this purse?
Way more than your salary.
What?
Natasha loves these bags.
And I love cars, Kabir.
Always remember.
If you ever want to gift
me an expensive car...
don't hesitate.
I won't.
Good.
Let's go.
I can't.
I need to make some calls.
I'll see you guys later.
Adios amigos.
- I thought this was a holiday.
- Me too.
Let's go.
We take the next right.
- Looks quite old.
- There it is.
There is the cathedral.
- Do you know where this place is?
- Yes, straight ahead.
How far is this gallery?
Shut up!
It's just here.
This is the street.
Catonia... whatever.
And that's the place.
I guess.
Hey!
Salman Habib.
It's a desi name.
He must be Pakistani or Indian.
Thanks.
I wish you'd come with us.
We walked all over
looking for his gallery.
Man, this city is beautiful.
Well, today I made
a 2,000 Pound commission, so...
excuse me if I don't complain.
Cheers.
- 2,000 Pounds?
- Yup!
Cheers.
Dude...
I heard something about you.
What?
You know what it is.
Mom told you?
Yes.
But did she tell you I was forced?
- Okay?
- Okay.
God man!
She can't keep anything to herself.
She's driving me crazy, man.
Yeah.
She came to London a few days ago.
And dragged me to
some friend's relative's place.
To see a girl.
Neelu aunty and
Gogi uncle's daughter Cookie.
I'd decided that I'd go,
have some tea...
exchange pleasantries and
decline the match.
As I took the first sip...
Cookie said 'no'!
So... you know...
What?!
I mean, so what!
What is there?
What?
Come on, man!
You were set up for
an arranged marriage...
and you got rejected?
But I didn't even try
to create an impression.
- Now you're just saying it.
- I didn't want to impress her!
You've ruined our reputation.
Shut up, please stop it!
Why did she have to tell you?
What's wrong with her?
Actually, your mom said nothing.
It's his latest trick.
And you're his latest victim.
- Cheers!
2,000 Pounds!
Grow up, man!
How old are you?
You know what...
we have to have some shots.
- One for Cookie.
- We'll raise a toast to Cookie.
Okay.
Not for me.
I have a conference call
in an hour.
Same old plan?
Mint money and retire at 40?
Yup!
That's the plan.
Listen...
thank you.
For what?
For coming on this trip.
It means a lot to me.
I'm sure it does.
Literacy is the key.
It's not that simple.
Oh - my - God!
Kabira, amazing choice.
She's gorgeous but she isn't ours.
What?
An SUV will be a lot comfortable.
To hell with the comfort.
Just look at her!
Guys?
- Hola, good morning.
Your name?
- Kabir Dewan.
- Guys!
Kabir... Arjun...
She's beautiful.
I've booked an SUV and
they've charged me, sorry.
Sell Natasha's purse.
Funny.
Please!
What are you doing?
Behave yourself!
Oh, don't even
think about it, dude.
All my life I sat in your car.
Now it's my turn.
What are you doing?
12,000 Euro. She rides first class.
Hey Sarah, what's up?
Mr. Yamamoto called?
Well, he'll have
the docket in two days.
No, no don't say I'm on a holiday.
Just get Joe to call me back. Bye.
Hey Joe, what's up?
Like... 'now' now?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I'll do it, bye.
Sorry guys.
Guys... ten minutes tops!
Moshi moshi, Arjun-san.
Moshi moshi, Yamamoto-san.
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
Moshi, moshi?
It's Japanese for hello.
- I assure you,
I will always be here for you.
Kabira...
Look at this amazing view.
And, now look at our friend.
My team is going to
put together all the information.
And you will have
the docket with you in three days.
What happened to him, dude?
If you ask me...
he has become mantally sick.
And he needs the psychaitrixt.
Isn't this from school?
Not school.
- Eschool!
- Eschool.
Eschool!
Because only the Mr. The Dubey
can the talk like this.
The Mr. The Dubey.
Are you mantally challanged my buy?
Not buy.
Bwoy.
- Bwoy.
Mantally challangedmy bwoy...
Mantal bwoy.
Thank you, Mr. Yamamoto.
Let's go. I'm done.
Arjun, my bwoy...
you look the mantalin this the uniform!
Let's go.
Okay, the very the well the saids.
Guys...
just do as I say.
It's been ten years since college.
Please grow up.
- Don't do this, please.
- Trust me.
You'll kiss me later.
When I shout...
point to the urinal and
scream loudly.
Bye!
Dude, you're the mantallythe sick!
People are the same everywhere.
It's just human nature.
What are you doing?
Poor thing's feeling hot.
Poor thing?
Kabira...
meet Bagwati.
What's happened to your jokes?
Are they sick?
Well, they've taken after you.
Hey Joe, yes I spoke to
Mr. Yamamoto and...
Somebody please
throw his phone out.
What the...
- Are you mad?
Did you just...
You think we'll get it?
Sorry, I didn't think he would do it.
Of course you didn't know, Kabir.
Now go find my phone.
- Where?
- I don't know.
I want my phone, that's all.
It could've broken.
Arjun, don't be silly...
we won't find it.
Silly?
You threw my phone out
of a moving car, you moron!
He said it, I threw it.
Didrt you?
Kabir...
please tell me to slap him.
Don't be silly.
Just tell me to slap him.
Just tell me to slap him.
Slap him.
- What's wrong with you?
- Guys!
I'll get you a new phone.
I was just joking.
Well, it's not funny.
That call was important.
You think being 'cool and funny'
gives you the license to do anything?
It's always like,
'lmran said this. He's so funny.'
Lmran did that, he is so cool'.
Grow up!
Throwing my phone
out the window is not funny!
Hooking up with my girlfriend
was not funny!
Listen...
it's been four years.
And I've apologised for it.
Now let it go.
Or what? Huh, what?
Stop it. Stop it, you two.
You're behaving like kids.
If there's a problem,
deal with it.
Like adults.
Who made you the judge?
Do you see anyone else here?
Listen.
Let's get this straight.
I don't have any problem with him.
Why would you have a problem?
Sonali was my girlfriend.
Come on, Sonali and me
fell in love.
It happens. Shit happens.
Yeah.
It was shit.
For me.
And I'm sure you didn't
give it a second thought.
Imran man...
I would never do that to you.
Arjun...
I screwed up.
Now what do you want me to do?
What do I do?
Should I wear a 'Sorry, Arjur t-shirt
and walk around?
What should I do?
Just look at him.
Listen to me, okay.
You two, please!
Sonali was a bitch.
Understand?
I'm sorry, really.
She used you.
Then gave you a BPL
and used him.
And she dumped you as well.
She was a waste of time then
and she is a waste of time now.
Four years ago we cancelled
this trip because of her.
Today we're here for me.
Don't let her ruin this.
Please!
How many times
do I have to apologise?
How many times?
Let's just make it clear.
Till it doesn't come from here.
What's BPL?
Bum Pe Laat.
[Kick in the arse.]
You're crazy.
Speak with him.
He slapped me.
I can't believe this.
Hi baby...
Good.
We've left Barcelona.
On the road.
Yes, it's beautiful.
Of course, they're with me.
Where will they go?
Everything is cool.
Yeah.
All ready.
Come on.
Yes!
Now this is a house.
- I like.
- Cool.
It's lovely.
You haven't seen the half of it yet.
Can we slide?
No, you can't.
- Captain.
- Amazing.
Wow, man!
This is nicer than the pictures.
Amazing.
What a view!
Someday.
How was it?
Refreshing.
Who is she?
How should I know, dude?
She's nice.
Really nice.
What's happening?
She's got me.
She's pulling me towards her.
She's pulling me.
I saw her first.
So true.
But has she seen you?
What?
- Hola.
- Hola.
Can I try that?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Brazil?
Half US, half India.
India?
What a coincidence!
Which part?
My dad's from Delhi but
I live in London.
Hindi? Not bad!
You too... wow!
If you're free,
want to join me for a drink?
I have an early morning.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Bye.
What's your name?
Laila.
Imran.
But my friends call me 'Romeo'.
Romeo?
Seriously man... Romeo?
I mean, chee!
Arjun...
It's a mars duty to try.
Success and failure are in His hands.
Great, professor.
Seriously?
You got me this time!
What the hell is this?
What?
This! What the hell is this?
You said I had to
get you a new phone.
You didn't specify which one.
I'm a trader.
Not a Japanese school girl.
Moshi moshi.
Shut up, just shut up!
- Just don't talk to me.
- Guys that's enough!
Look at this.
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with you?
It's funny.
Anyway, now listen.
Why we are here in Costa Brava.
Ready for this?
Yeah.
Deep... sea...
diving.
What?
Yes, our training begins
first thing tomorrow.
I'm sorry but...
why is this turning into a
let's torture Arjun holiday?
I just don't understand.
Relax, I know.
I spoke with the people
at the diving school.
You don't need to know how to swim.
At least you know how to drown.
Listen, just keep quiet. Just...
keep quiet.
Kabir...
I don't understand how you thought
I'll do this.
What's wrong with you?
Bathroom... to the left.
Okay, listen.
I know you're scared of water.
Okay.
But then that's the challenge.
And it's completely safe.
Think about it.
Blue waters... okay?
Fish swimming close to you.
Corals...
It'll be amazing.
Look, if you're not comfortable,
no one's going to force you.
No, I'm serious, it's okay.
Okay. Fine.
Kabir Dewan?
Laila?
Hey.
Hi, what are you doing here?
Following you, I guess.
Really?
No.
I'm here to train you.
I'm an instructor here.
Wow!
- Hi, I'm Kabir.
- Laila.
- This is Arjun.
- Hi.
Laila.
Romeo?
You remember?
Arjun...
If you don't want to dive,
it's totally fine.
He can't swim.
It's okay, doesn't matter.
You'll be fine.
Thank you.
Shall we start?
Let's go.
It's a little difficult to
talk under water.
For obvious reasons.
So these signs are very important.
Up.
Down.
Okay.
Not okay.
Air guage.
Okay?
Okay?
Alright!
You have to wear a wet suit.
The water is pretty cold.
Next is the BCD.
Your buoyancy control device.
All okay?
These weights will help you
remain underwater.
Finally, your fins.
Cheers. Salut.
Good job, boys.
So, when is the wedding?
In two months.
- That's like now, man.
- Yeah, I know.
We only started dating
about six months ago.
Well, you know what they say...
when it's right, it's right.
That's what I said.
Actually, she said it.
What does she do?
Interior design.
And she's bloody good.
Okay.
And of course,
her father has a hotel business...
that's evaluated at...
Ten billion?
Ten billion.
I'm not marrying her for her money.
Kabir, of course not.
But you've got to admit,
it's a plus point.
Plus point?
Are you serious?
Would you marry for money?
Depends.
How much?
Ten billion!
Definitely.
And what if she's a bore?
When you have ten billion in your bank
who needs the wife for entertainment?
- Romantic.
- I agree, it's true.
- Cheers!
Are you seeing someone?
Do you have a girlfriend?
No.
Hey... what about Rohini?
What happened there?
- She was nice.
- Well...
I guess she wanted
different things out of life.
Laila...
apart from my body
what else do you want out of life?
I don't know.
I haven't really made a list.
Still...
there must be something.
I guess, I want that...
life should continue to surprise me.
Inspire me.
Make me meet new people.
Hola.
Hola.
Hola?
Sorry.
Give me new experiences.
And...
I want...
you to get me a drink.
Your wish is my command.
- One for me, please.
- Arjun?
I'm okay.
- Keep it down.
- Guys we're gonna get arrested.
He's here. Quiet.
I was just telling...
that's the problem you see.
Sorry.
Your life is about to change.
That's if I survive!
We'll see.
Yup, we'll see.
The moment flows by like molten sapphire
Deep blue silences
No earth below, no sky above
The rustling branches and leaves
Are saying only you are here
Only me
My breath and my heartbeat
Such depth, such solitude
And me
Only me
I now believe I esist
Baby, it was amazing.
You should definitely do it.
I have no interest.
Hey!
Hey...
Sorry. Can I use your loo?
Lmran is taking a shower.
Sure.
Who is that?
Wait. First say hi to Natasha.
Okay.
Hey... I'm Laila.
Hi.
Kabir has told me a lot about you.
Congratulations in advance.
Thanks.
Well, it's really nice to meet you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Who is that?
That's Laila, our instructor.
She's studying fashion in London but...
three months a year she works
at dive sites around the world.
Isn't that cool?
Very cool.
What is she doing in your room?
She's using the bathroom.
Imran invited her over for dinner.
To celebrate our first dive.
D'you think I'm stupid?
What? It's the truth.
Arjun is cooking.
Yeah, you must be very busy.
I'll speak to you later.
Natasha, why are you getting upset?
I'm not upset.
I've a flight to catch.
You're being really silly.
Yeah, I know. Bye.
Bye.
- All okay?
- Yeah, fine.
- See you downstairs.
- See you.
Need some help?
Nope. Almost done.
Paella.
- Yup.
- Very nice.
Thanks.
So...
you didn't tell me how it was.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
You did it.
So, how was it?
It was magical.
It felt like the
most peaceful place on earth.
It was beautiful.
I was 16 when I did my first dive.
And then stopping myself
was impossible.
Yeah, it could be addictive.
Addictive?
No.
Addiction is such a negative word.
Diving is...
something else for me.
It's like meditation.
You're conscious of
every breath, every moment.
Just imagine...
living your whole life like that.
Be fully alive to each and every moment.
Delicious.
- Seriously.
- Thank you.
You should cook more often.
I know man but...
where's the time!
So, the fear of water still there?
Now there's no fear.
Not even of life.
Wow! In one dunk
you've unravelled the mystery of life!
Well done, my lad.
Actually, it's quite simple.
What is it?
Just...
keep breathing.
Laila!
Finally, our old friend has surfaced.
And to avoid a relapse...
why don't you join us on the trip?
I'd love to.
But I'm off to Buñol tomorrow.
It's the Tomatina festival.
- Too bad!
- Is it?
Toma-tina, what's that?
Arjun!
How can you not know that...
it is world s largest tomato fight?!
It's like our festival of colours.
But played with tomatoes instead.
Really?
Actually, you guys should come.
It'll be a blast.
I'm in.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm in.
What? No!
We're leaving for Seville tomorrow.
That's perfect.
Buñol is en-route.
- Come on.
Look, Seville is Arjurs choice.
He made the reservations.
To mess with Arjurs reservations is...
like inviting Death!
Come on.
Alright, let me see what I can do.
Is that your phone?
It's a long story.
Let's not go there.
No, it's nice.
He's very much in touch
with his feminine side.
Eat your food.
Don't worry, even I like pink.
Great, I feel much better.
Thank you.
How could you do this?
Rohini, I'm really sorry but...
can't you see that
this deal could help me.
Can't you see that maybe I don't care!
You don't care.
- You don't care about my life?
- Stop it, Arjun.
Don't confuse your work with your life.
Your work isn't your life.
It's just a part of it.
Just like this relationship
is a part of your life.
- What about this?
- What about this?
I bought this apartment so that
we could live together.
What? Please!
You bought this apartment to impress people
with your up market address.
I can't believe you just said that.
- I'm planning a future with you.
- Our future will come tomorrow, Arjun.
- Don't scream!
- Where is our today?
Don't scream.
Then listen to me.
What do you want?
I want to spend time with you.
I want a relationship.
Not a retirement plan.
Please, Rohini.
The chairman of Nakatomi Corporation
wants a meeting with me.
What do I do?
I have to go.
If the presentation does it,
he'll give us the entire account.
That will boost my career.
Can't you see that?
What about our deal?
We can go next month.
It's my birthday, Arjun.
- I know.
- It won't come next month.
You had promised that we would
go to Italy no matter what.
And you cancelled the tickets
without even talking to me.
Rohini, I really am sorry.
Please understand. Just a second.
It's an important call.
Just one second.
Rohini, one second.
Hello...
Yes, Alex...
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Hey babe, I guess you're on the plane.
I called to say that we're going to
Buñol tomorrow, for the Tomatina festiva
Laila is taking us.
Please don't be upset.
Please call when you get this message.
I love you.
Where the hell is he?
Oh - my - God!
- I love it.
- Unbelievable!
- Okay.
- Yes?
- Can I drive?
- No.
Kabira...
if four days of diving
can do this to you.
Trust me, you should stay under water.
Who knows if I'll be with you guys again...
I decided, it's all or bust!
- Right?
- Correct.
Dude, you're getting married.
You're not going to prison.
Thanks.
All set?
- Arjun...
can you help me?
- It's to the right.
- It's jammed, what did you do?
Dude!
You have to apply some force.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Child!
Relax in the front seat.
Driver... Buñol.
So Lailaji, hale and hearty
both packed in the bag?
No, thanks.
What are you doing?
Laila, meet Bagwati.
Hi Bagwati.
Bagwatithinks you are very beautiful.
Thank you, Bagwati.
The evening was hazy...
The mood was sad...
A thousand memories vanished as they came...
That's really nice.
You wrote it?
I wish...
It's by Raghupati Sahai Firaq.
Even our man writes quite well.
- Really?
- Thanks man.
- What say, Kabir?
- Of course.
Diamond biscuit Diamond biscuit...
Whenever in a mood just have it...
Diamond biscuit Diamond biscuit...
For a healthy life just taste it...
Whenever mummy daddy bring it out...
All the happy kids squeal and shout...
Diamond biscuit Diamond biscuit...
For a healthy life just taste it...
Now available in a new coconut flavour.
- So beautiful.
- One has to do it, assholes!
Inspired writing.
- It's kind of nice.
- Isn't it?
Brought a smile to your face, didn't it?
Hello.
Hi, it's me.
- Where are you?
- Just landed in London.
Look...
I'm sorry I hung up yesterday.
It's okay.
You know what, just forget about it.
Thank you.
So, you're going Buñol?
Chee!
- What happened?
- What are you doing?
Sorry.
Yes.
- Laila, where are we staying?
- Hotel Venta Pilar.
Some Venta Pilar...
Venta Pilar.
Okay, fine.
Well you have fun, okay.
Okay, of course.
Arjun...
what are you doing man?
- Again?
- What are you doing?
I'm sorry, it's the wind.
I'm really sorry.
Really?
By the way, Bagwatiis feeling kinda hot.
I'll let her get some wind by the window.
- Turn left here.
- Yeah?
- I know I'll see her somewhere.
There she is.
- Hola!
Everybody this is Nuria.
- Hola.
- Arjun.
- That's Kabir.
- Hello.
And that's lmran in the corner.
- Hola!
She's saying it's already started.
We have to go.
We're going to miss it.
Imran.
- The bags?
- These guys will take care of them.
- But my laptop.
- Arjun, let's go. Come on!
- Okay.
- Imran.
We're leaving you.
Laila...
your friend is very cute.
Is that so?
You've already forgotten me?!
You're pathetic!
Laila...
You will go down in history
as my first love.
Okay listen guys,
there are two rules.
You have to make way for the trucks.
And squash the tomatoes
before throwing them.
Otherwise it hurts.
Alright? Let's go!
- Kabira, squash it.
- Did it hurt?
- Of course.
- Shit man!
What are you guys doing?
There are rules.
Have you ever followed a rule in your life?
You bastard, now you want rules!
Come here!
Come here I'll tell you the rules.
Come on!
Ooh aah... take the world and paint it red
Ooh aah... paint it red
There's a passion, a madness
All around
A carefree gladness
All around
Somewhere lightly, the colours fall
Stories of yesterday, you can't recall
Someone softly tells my heart
Give yourself away, let the magic start
This moment that's so whole
Seems high on its own
This moment unveils its intosication on you
Now you're in the mood
You hold hands with the groove
As voices blend in with the hues
And it's stinking too.
You're going to get this.
- She's going to get it.
- Put me down!
Kabir?
Natasha?
What are you doing?
Hi...
I came here to surprise you.
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.
I am happy.
Yeah, you look it.
Natasha...
this is my bachelor trip.
And you know, I want to
spend this time with my friends.
Really? Laila is your friend?
She's our diving instructor.
I told you on the phone.
And the other one... Nancy?
Nuria.
Whatever!
Oh God, Natasha!
I just met her this morning!
She was kind enough to give us her room.
We'll probably never see each other again!
That's just perfect!
No one will ever know what happened.
Is that why you are here?
The apology on the phone was
just an excuse to get the address.
How dare you, Kabir?
- That's really mature...
- Shut up!
Who is it?
Lmran.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hey.
I'm sorry, I just need my bag.
Don't apologise, it's totally cool.
Thanks.
Thanks.
We've made dinner plans,
would you like to join us?
- Actually...
- Yes.
Definitely, sounds like fun.
Okay, I'll call when we're heading out.
We don't have to go.
I don't want your friends to
think I'm a witch!
Witch alert!
Our holiday is in danger.
Who is next?
Mind if I go first?
Even I love you very much.
Dude, I can't believe Natasha's here.
I'm shocked!
Why?
What's the big deal?
Laila...
your fiancée can't crash your bachelor party.
That's the only rule!
Rule?
- You guys are so stupid.
- What?
Stupid?
You're stupid.
Natasha hates you.
What?
Yes, she said...
Is Laila your friend?
She asked you that?
No, she asked Kabir.
I was eavesdropping outside the door.
Of course.
How do you say,
'can I come ir, in Spanish?
Dude, what're you doing?
Don't be stupid!
Yes?
See you in the lobby.
I want to learn Flamenco.
It looks like so much fun.
Laila, you live in Spain?
No, in London.
So does Arjun.
Yeah.
Kabir and I will be there
after this holiday.
We should definitely get together.
Yeah, we should.
I'd love to but I'm off to
Morocco from here.
For a month.
Wow!
I think all of you
should come to Seville with us.
I'm going back to London tomorrow.
You only came here for a day?
Yeah.
Kabir wants to hang with the two of you.
I don't want to disturb your plans.
Don't be silly, Natasha.
You're hardly a disturbance.
- That's really sweet, lmran.
Thank you.
But, Kabir said it's a miracle to
get you two together.
And you have to attend the wedding.
No excuses.
100 percent!
Of course!
Excuses...
Could we get the more
the red the wines?
Arjun, the translation into the Españols?
Lmran, please!
It's because of such behaviour
that Indians have a bad reputation.
Will you please tell him?
Lmran, don't do it.
Chee!
What chee? He is right!
I agree with you.
Imran, it's wrong.
No.
I'm the very the sorry
No, I'm sorry.
Not funny!
- Been to Morocco?
- Morocco? No!
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.
Let's go?
In a bit.
Moshi moshi.
- Will you do me a favour?
- No way!
Why don't you both take a long walk?
Dude, it's late, we're tired.
You must be tired.
- You must be tired.
- No, not really.
That's the spirit.
The night is young.
You two aren't that old either!
I'm sure you'll come up
with some plan.
- You sure?
- Come on.
Shit! I forgot my phone.
Arert you on a holiday?
And, you are absolutely right.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
Really?
Why not?
You see, the guys I liked...
wanted different things out of life.
What kind of guys do you like?
What's your type?
I don't have a type.
Come on, everyone has a type.
Really?
Like I know, a guy who gets
only three weeks off in a year...
isn't your type.
He can't be anyone's type.
He has no time.
He is a slave.
And one who only thinks of his career,
isn't your type either.
If he only thinks about his career,
then he is a bore.
Or someone who thinks money is
the most important thing in life.
Like you!
You don't know anything about me.
So?
So, don't judge me.
I wasrt judging you.
I'm merely asking...
does money really make you happy?
I was eight when my dad passed away.
Leaving behind a huge debt
for my mother.
Very early I understood that...
only money makes the world go round.
Simple as that.
- I understand, Arjun.
But you still haven't
answered my question.
Yes, money makes me happy.
Then why did you cry,
the other day...
after the dive?
Has a paycheque ever brought
tears to your eyes?
- No,
Think about it.
When you've done so well in life...
are you really happy?
Even today if you feel
something is missing...
what is it?
Take time out for things that...
give you genuine joy.
Like cooking.
Well, that's the plan, I mean...
I'll retire at 40 and...
Dude!
How do you know
if you'll be alive till then?
Seize the day, my friend.
First, live this day to the fullest.
Then think about 40.
Come on.
My friends don't know
why I made them come here.
Your skin is beautiful.
I love your colour.
I want to meet Salman Habib.
I've never met him.
I have never met my father.
What if he
doesn't want to meet me?
- You're welcome.
Why are we lying here?
I mean, it's ridiculous.
No.
It's ridiculous that
you've never done this before.
What to do?
I'm stuck with
a beautiful home in London.
Only someone who has
never slept under the stars...
can say something so stupid.
Wow man.
I should learn from you.
I feel like I've spent my life in a box.
But you...
you are free.
You're free, Laila.
Arjun...
The only time a man
should be in a box...
is when he's dead.
Natasha, stay for a few more days.
You don't mean that.
No, I do.
I don't like it that you're so sad.
What do you expect?
How would you feel if I just left you
and took off with my friends?
You have your own life.
And if you and Sameera
ever decide to go on a trip...
why would I stop you?
And if I told you
that we've met some guys...
and made dinner plans
with them, then?
Then what?
Then what?
I trust you.
Of course I'd want
you both to be safe...
but besides that,
I won't suspect you.
I'm sorry, but it's easier said than done.
Babe...
you're welcome to stay
if you want to.
But if you don't,
I'll drive you to the airport tomorrow.
Good night.
- I'll miss you.
- Take care.
- Stay in touch. See at the wedding.
- Imran, can you help me?
- Of course.
For sure. Okay?
- Email me.
- I will.
Good luck.
Hey...
Yesterday was...
I had the best time yesterday.
Me too.
And good luck...
for your upcoming adventures.
Thanks.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Bye.
Ciao.
A thought came alive, but away it hid
It stole a glance, from under the eyelids
Sometimes from you, sometimes from me
it asked for words to set it free
Words to wear, so from the lips it can flee
A voice it can embrace and sway with glee
But this thought
Is a feeling... just a feeling
