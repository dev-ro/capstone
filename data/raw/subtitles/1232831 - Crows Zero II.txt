GENJI-SAN!
YES! Another loss!
Sorry Serizawa, but I
guess it's my win again.
But what is Takiya thinking?!
Neglecting the Suzuran War!
Hey! There is still some money missing!
If he beats Rindaman, then no one
would be able to stand against him.
But it seems like his
strength is at its limit.
Despite that, he'll just
keep on challenging Rindaman.
Well that's good! He'll
get defeated again anyway.
But we lost to GPS.
Still talking about that?
If it wasn't for Bandou, we
would've won. Right Serizawa?
Juvenile Centre
One...Two
One, Two, Three, Four
You're free to go. Do your best.
I'm really sorry for what I did,
back then...
Kawaishi Noburu!
We've been waiting for you.
Two years ago you murdered Bitou Makio-san,
now one of his brothers is the leader of Housen!
Let's settle this!
GET HIM!
Kawaishi-san!
HEY! You better hand him over to us!
What the hell do you baldies want?!
Now guys, calm down.
What did you say?!
SERIZAWA!
Hey! Do you plan to cover for Kawaishi?
Suzuran and Housen have
a pact of non-agression.
We've been waiting for the day
that guy gets out of prison.
Because of what happened two years ago?
He's just a murderer!
He was expelled from Suzuran so
you have nothing to do with this.
You're not the one to decide that. I do!
Gen-san,
let's forget about Rindaman and
concentrate on conquering Suzuran instead.
Chuta is right.
Even though we defeated the Serizawa
Faction, there is still alot to do.
Huh?
There's something going on over there.
Serizawa!
If you've decided to step into this situation,
we're going to have to deal with you also!
Hey you idiots!
Genji!
Hey bastard, get out of here!
What the hell is going on here?
This has nothing to do with you.
Stop acting all cool you hobo.
You shouldn't be calling
the Head of Suzuran a hobo.
Are you also from Suzuran?
Takiya Genji.
He's the Head of Suzuran.
DON'T YOU FORGET IT!
Serizawa!
This guy just broke
the non-agression pact.
So that means Housen and Suzuran are
going to war once again, doesn't it?
This concerns me and not some war.
But since the Head
of Suzuran started it,
we can't just let this go!
Fine by me!
STOP IT GENJI!
Kawaishi Noburu!
We'll let you off just for today.
Lets go.
Hey baldies!
Say 'Hi' to your mothers for me!
Long time no see.
When did you get out?
Don't worry.
Who's that guy?
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?
What?
So, we're going to war against Housen?
Yeah.
Looks like it.
The non-agression pact is broken and
it's all thanks to the Head of Suzuran.
Crows Zero II
Two years ago:
Kawaishi-san!
We need to stop Bitou!
SHUT UP!
BITOU!
Suzuran will never lose!
I doubt that!
After that Bitou died and Kawaishi
was sent to the Juvenile Centre.
But as a result a huge hate between
Housen and Suzuran was created,
and many fights broke out
between the two schools.
And thats why a non-agression
pact was created?
Yeah.
No one should ever break it. It's something
that must be protected at any cost...
Don't tell me that the pact was broken?!
Genji! You...
Oh Ruka-san!
We'll finish this later!
So did you get into another fight again?
Shut up.
I found Ken-san.
So what?
He misses you.
He only did it because
he wanted to protect you.
GENJI!
FLY!
Ken-san died?
Yes.
His boss killed him.
That's the truth.
Now you can go away.
Can you tell me who that boss is?
What?
Tell me, i want to meet him.
Don't make me laugh, you're just a kid.
Go home.
Hey...
HEY! JUST WAIT! HEY!
Hey,
since you're a friend of Ken's,
you should know that i killed him.
The new Head of Suzuran...
what was his name again?
Takiya Genji.
He broke the non-agression pact.
Serizawa is such an amazing
man for letting that happen.
We're going to destroy Suzuran!
YES!
Ryo,
you've always held back when you fight.
But since this time our opponent
is Suzuran, you can go all out.
What about Kawaishi?
Makio-san's death will not be in vein.
Which one of you is Narumi Taiga?!
I just got transfered here from
Suzuran, the name's Washio Gota!
And I'm here to rule Housen!
That's a good line!
Are you Narumi?!
Where's Narumi Taiga?!
I'm a former boss from Suzuran and I'm
here to take out Housen's strongest guy!
What?
Is it you?!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I hate Suzuran.
I can't go back there.
I want to destroy them!
What?
You really are an idiot!
Hey!
You're an interesting guy.
Madoba!
Go and get Tatsuya.
Tatsuya?!
Bitou Tatsuya, the younger
brother of the late Bitou Makio.
He just got transfered this year.
He's a fearsome freshman.
Alright!
LOOK TOKIO!
Are you some kind of idiot?!
Hey, I was waiting for you.
Okay.
GPS and the Serizawa
Faction are involved in this.
This conversation again?
Housen is very dangerous.
If we don't lend you a hand,
Suzuran will be destroyed.
Either way, this isn't a
situation you can win on your own.
We defeated your faction.
When I defeat Rindaman,
Suzuran will be unified.
Nothing will stand in
my way when that happens.
I never said I'd
recognise you as the boss.
Anyway, concerning what we were just
talking about, GPS is more than enough.
Genji!
Don't underestimate Housen.
Those guys are the real deal.
Tokio!
Don't push yourself.
You just had brain surgery. If
you're not careful, you can die.
Well, I'd have to agree
with him on that one.
Well done guys.
That's how a real man should act!
Oh...
Tatsuya!
You wanted to see me?
We're going to attack Suzuran.
Will you come?
We're going to take
revenge for Makio-san.
I doubt you guys can pull it off.
What was that?!
Don't get cocky just because
you're Makio-san's brother!
Don't you want retribution from
Suzuran for killing your brother?
My brother is long dead.
Whatever you do won't make a difference.
Are you making fun of us?
I thank you Narumi-san, for being like a little
brother to Bitou Makio, however im just a freshman.
Ryo!
Start attacking Suzuran.
You're looking for
the old Boating Garage?
Is there one here?
There should be one
somewhere around here.
That way.
Ken-san?
Kawaishi!
So! It's good isnt it? It's warm.
At least its better than
what they serve in juvie.
You shouldn't complain!
Hey, you know I've been
fixing that boats engine!
Hopefully I can set sail with
it. I've become a man of the sea!
Oh, do you still remember during Suzuran,
when we spent all our time in stupid fights?
Yeah, good times!
But you always got your ass kicked.
Hey!
Ever since I left
Suzuran I've done nothing.
My life was better
when I was at Suzuran.
Well, we're not there anymore Ken-san.
Ken-san.
What the hell are you doing?
Pretending to be dead and coming
to a crappy place like this?
I did something unforgivable
during my time in the Yakuza.
I totally regret what i did...
to Bitou.
I just wanted Suzuran to win.
Maybe you should have lost that war.
If Suzuran had lost to Housen back then,
I would've been the one
responsible for that!
I just did what had to be done!
Forget it.
I too regret it.
At that time,
you could have defeated
him without that knife.
It doesn't matter anymore.
A loss is a loss.
Everyone listen up!
It's time you all
join up and follow GPS!
We will conquer Suzuran!
Come on! Stand behind GPS!
Join up and follow behind GPS!
Come on and be apart of the team!
What a bunch of idiots!
What's wrong?
Hey you!
What?
Are you joining us or not?
Hey, what's wrong you bastard?
Hello Kyoko-rin?
Yes its me, Maki.
A date?!
When?
Tomorrow by the riverside?
And they'll be by the
riverside tomorrow.
That had nothing to do with
you wanting us joining GPS.
Tell me the reason why you're here?
No reason.
I just wanted to give a haircut.
You're haircut's done.
Hey!
Don't fuck around with us!
Izaki-san!
It's true that we acknowledge the
strength of Takiya for defeating Serizawa,
but we are not going to follow him!
I see.
Then you better be ready
because we not holding back.
I'm talking to you!
HEY!
Is it okay for a guy like
you to follow Takiya?!
Welcome home.
Gen!
So how are things at Suzuran?
Yeah its a piece of cake.
Gen!
What?!
Let me introduce you.
It's your new mother.
How are you doing Gen?
It's just a joke.
Omaeda!
Yes!
Show her the door.
Yes sir!
Follow me.
Be serious you idiot.
Alright! Should we do it now?
What?
We're going to join with GPS!
What the hell are you talking about?!
Like I said, we're
going to join with GPS!
Hey! What the fuck are you thinking?
We lost, so we don't want to be
apart of the losing team anymore!
What the hell did you say you bastard?!
Tokaji!
Let them do what they want!
Sorry but now we going to follow Genji.
Tokio-kun! Get up!
Oh come on get up!
Its the super fast,
super healing, super glue!
Get well soon.
Love Love! Steam?!
Oh no!
I must calm down!
Are you alright?
I managed to hold it in!
What?
Is this really necessary?
Alright it's done!
We're new to the
faction! Nice to meet you!
This is a gift for Takiya. A Mikami
original jersey! Wear it with pride!
Thank you.
Hey, solve these things by yourself!
It's not as easy at it looks,
you of all people should know.
Ken-san!
You're late! The ceremony is over!
Makise is nowhere to be found!
What?!
Where is that guy?!
Yeah, where is he?!
He should be here! There's still the matter
about Housen we need to discuss with him!
Yeah!
Dammit! That gorrila!
Kyoko-rin!
Maki!
Have you been waiting?
Nope, i just got here.
Want to go for a walk?
Okay!
Watch out, there are snakes around here.
What? I hate snakes!
It's a snake!
It's a river snake!
You bastard!
What the hell is that gorilla doing?
No clue.
Wait!
You must be tired, let's
sit here for a while.
Okay!
Please, sit.
Kyoko-rin!
SAFE!
Are you some kind of idiot?!
What did you say?!
Hey, what the hell is that?!
Yeah, that box floating over there?
What box?!
Oh no! The condoms that I had so much trouble buying and that I was
gonna use after she was scared by that fake snake i put under the bridge!
Kyoko-rin!
Kyoko-rin!
Kyoko-rin!
Kyoko-rin!
Kyoko-rin!
Bye!
Hey pass me the ball!
What the...
Get ready Suzuran!
Stop it!
STOP IT!
Let's go.
HEY!
It's not over.
Been wondering when you'd show.
Alright! LETS DO THIS!
Kyoko-rin!
Shut up!
Hey its a snake!
I said shut up!
What the hell do you guys want?!
Hey!
Aren't you one of our Sophmores?
Now I'm Housen's Washio Gota! KILL THEM!
Someone call an ambulance!
Washio!
Washio!
Real men don't behave like this!
Narumi!
As expected from Suzuran.
What?
You see,
I want a 'one on one' with your leader.
Fine by me!
You are a real man!
Ryo!
Don't you ever show your
face around me ever again.
Do you understand?
I understand.
Is he strong?
That Takiya Genji?
What?
I want to meet him.
The man who defeated Serizawa!
Makise and the others, Tokaji and
Tsutsumoto were all attacked by Housen!
How could this happen to Makise?!
If they get to you, it's
all over for Suzuran!
What the hell are you talking about?!
You're standing at the top of Suzuran.
You should be more aware of that!
Take my place then!
Don't fuck around!
I chose to follow behind you
because I believed in you!
If we don't do something, Suzuran
will be destroyed by Housen!
Then what should we do?!
Just wait.
I have an idea!
Tsutsumoto...
He needs to be in hospital for 3 months.
Who could do that to him?
Urushibara Ryo was in that
group, so it was probably him!
What do you want?
Serizawa.
Come with me.
If I defeat you, you'll join GPS.
Takiya sent you?
This has nothing to do with him.
Ever since I entered Suzuran, you were
always my enemy, but I never challenged you.
Meanwhile, you stood at the top!
So this is just a problem
between you and me.
I come to you for a request.
Why should I listen?
Please let me ask you.
Go on, out with it!
Please let me join the Yakuza.
Join the Yakuza?
Becoming a Yakuza isn't
something any idiot can do.
Katagiri is proof of that.
Hey brother!
If you want to be in the boss's good graces,
you should do something about the Ryuseikai boss.
They are our direct rivals, eliminating
the boss would do wonders for your position.
The Ryuseikai boss should
be out somewhere tonight.
Don't over do it.
Did something happen?
Genji!
Please take this to the counter.
Yes!
What do you want?
What do I want?
Aren't you the heir of the Yakuza?!
You already have a woman
even though you're just a kid!
You wanted to lead my Yakuza but
you haven't even unified Suzuran!
Shut up.
What kind of punch do you throw?
What?
What kind of punch do you throw?
Show me. Let me see your punch!
Come on.
Come on! Are you scared?
Are you really scared?!
You're a little scared aren't you?!
Is your head alright?
Come on! Come on hit me! Hit me!
It's a good punch.
But not enough!
That kind of punch has to have
more heart than actual strength!
And your heart is useless!
Come on, hit me again!
Damn you old man!
Temper, temper! You're too hot headed!
You should really change that anger of
yours, it's not doing you or anyone good.
Always think before you act, don't
charge in without knowing your purpose.
Sempai!
Thanks.
Take it.
Okay.
Hey!
Hideo Takiya! What brings you here?
How are you? Everything well?
I'm good, everything is fine.
That's good to hear.
Best be going.
Good bye!
I'm going to take a piss.
You go wait over there for me.
Yes!
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Please come in!
Young boss!
His condition is stable but
we can't let our guard down.
Sorry,
but can you all leave this room?
Come on.
What the hell are you doing?
I still have a punch to give you!
Kawaishi! Your target is still alive!
If he talks, then it's all over for you!
Go over to the hospital and
make sure he dies this time!
Are you finished mixing that?
And in other news, Hideo Takiya, boss of the Ryuseikai Yakuza
was shot tonight in an attempted murder by an unknown suspect.
Hey I'm gonna borrow your truck!
Are you still here?
I don't want to leave.
Makio-san ruled this place.
This place has the smell of real men!
I'm not a homo.
Your brother will be avenged!
My brother isn't dead!
What?
In my heart, he's still alive!
I see.
The destruction of Suzuran
was Makio-san's goal.
And now, you and I will
accomplish that goal for him!
Suzuran is my problem!
Until the day I face them,
I will make Housen strong,
stronger than my brother's Housen,
and then,
I will avenge my brother!
As expected!
But,
the Housen right now is strong enough!
Seriza Tamao is an amazing man!
So is the man who defeated him.
Takiya Genji isn't a nobody either!
So if we defeat them, we
can defeat Suzuran for sure,
and then Housen will become the true
king that nobody would dare to challenge!
Do you still want more?
That's enough!
Your enemy is not me.
If you destroy everything, you'll
have to start again from scratch.
I did it!
Don't underestimate Washio!
Are you alright?
What the hell?
Serizawa brought you here.
You were half dead!
Maybe I should really die.
What the hell are you talking about?
What is that?
Suzuran's on fire!
What the hell?
Genji!
They finally did it!
Damn those bastards!
Let's go Genji!
GENJI!
Why?
Gen-san!
Are you angry?
Don't worry.
It's not that big of a deal.
Chuta, cigerette!
Hey!
What do you want?
Move, I'm going to solve this!
With a head like that, what can you do?!
HEY YOU BASTARD!
Say it again.
With a head like that...
Like I said, with a head like...
STOP FUCKING AROUND!
How could you?
HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN GENJI!
Stop being a coward!
What?
Come on.
Hey, hit me!
I'M TELLING YOU TO HIT ME!
GENJI!
HIT ME!
Alright.
I'll hit you.
But don't blame me if you die!
Every single one of you,
should just shut up!
Genji!
Take the top!
So this is where you are!
Why did you come to Suzuran?
Since you came,
Suzuran has just been dividing
itself more than it already was.
You can't rule Suzuran
with just strength alone.
You can't do it with
a half-assed purpose.
Gen-san!
Lets go!
Show them the way of the Crows!
What's done is done! I
can't take back what i did!
Then why did you do
it in the first place?
Don't fuck with me you bastard!
You guys are too soft!
If you don't start something like
this, they would never fight back!
Hey!
We have guests!
You!
I'm Narumi Taiga!
It's not the first time we've met is it?
Whatever.
Fine stare! You guys
will be great opponents!
Are you the one who
burnt down our school?
Who knows?
Was that answer good for you?
So what?
I'll destroy you!
Interesting! When?
Tomorrow.
Place?
Here is good enough! You guys will
be destroyed in your own grounds!
Can't wait for that!
Okay. I'll make it interesting for you!
Just returning the favor.
Ally with you against Housen?
Stop beating around bush!
Do you want me to beg like this?
"Lets do it! Let's do it together"
GPS started it, so it's your problem!
You guys are just freshman,
you should just follow us!
Didn't you use to follow Serizawa?
What?! Are you trying
to pick a fight with me?!
Izaki!
What's wrong? Did Housen do something?
No. Why wasn't I with you?!
What?
Huh?
Dammit!
Aren't we going against Housen?
That's what I was told.
Who told you that?
That's not like Takiya.
Sound test.
This is Takiya.
I'm not good with things like this,
and I don't really know what to say.
I...
always tried to become
stronger to supass my Father.
In order to accomplish that
goal, I came to Suzuran.
Hey Chuta!
What does this mean?
Shut up and listen to what he says.
But...
right now,
that Father of mine,
is fighting for his life in hospital.
I...
used to hate my old man.
But he showed me,
what it's like to be a man.
I want to believe in myself.
It's really hard,
for me to understand what's
in the other person's head.
Tomorrow,
I'm going to attack Housen,
and I need everyone's strength.
Please, lend me your power.
I'm not asking you to follow me,
but just...
lend me your strength.
That is all.
ALRIGHT YOU GUYS! GET PSYCHED!
Tomorrow,
come.
See you there.
STOP IT!
So this is what you were thinking?!
Don't fuck with me!
So the attemptive
muderer was your doing?!
I will not let you touch him again!
SHUT UP!
I have to do as they say
or else they will kill me!
Now get stand aside.
MOVE!
Are you threatening me?!
Don't fuck with me you bastard!
You bastard! You should know the
value of life better than anyone else!
Listen Kawaishi, listen.
It's true that we are
not strong human beings.
That's why we need to try
out best to win in life.
We need to win in life!
You are so much more than this.
If you go through with this,
you'll end up pathetic like i did!
But,
I'm not going to give up!
Never! Even if it hurts me!
Even if I have to keep on trying, even if I'm almost
dead! I will still push foward to the end to win in life!
Don't run away anymore!
Kawaishi.
You are not alone!
You can ask for help anytime you want!
Don't do this.
You still have a life!
What the hell are you
thinking you bastard!
Please wait!
PLEASE WAIT!
LET HIM GO!
SHUT UP!
HE WASN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING!
PLEASE DON'T HURT KAWAISHI!
PLEASE DEAL WITH ME! HE
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!
I know you, you guys are...
our rivals after all!
PLEASE FORGIVE US! Forgive us!
Let's take them both!
What the?
Shut up.
Katagiri,
you shouldn't speak
too loud in a hospital.
You,
of all people, saved my life.
Now I'll return the favor.
Let them both go!
But boss! He tried to kill you!
Fly.
Crows!
Genji-san.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Is it just this many?!
Hey, hey!
Makise where are the rest of the guys?!
This isn't even half of our army!
Sorry,
but this is the best I could do.
Hey! Are you getting soft?
What the hell is this?!
Looks like no one wants
to follow Takiya Genji.
You have no power!
Let's go.
Why don't you guys
beg Serizawa for help?
What was that?!
Izaki-san!
You said to come,
so showing our faces here is enough.
Sorry,
but this isn't our fight.
Hey!
Hey! Wait!
HEY! WAIT YOU BASTARDS! WAIT!
We're running out of time.
If this continues, we'll be destroyed!
Fine by me!
All us Seniors are more
than enough to defeat Housen!
Gen-san!
Let's do this!
Genji.
Go home.
Everybody just go home.
What are you on about?
Don't be stupid, there's
no way we can win this war.
Gen-san, what do you mean by that?
We did everything you asked of us.
Chuta.
You did well.
GPS,
is disbanded!
Hey!
Are you running away Genji?!
Don't you realise,
we're going to lose for sure!
Am I wrong?
I'm not like you.
Sorry.
Hey!
GENJI!
If you want to die, go by yourself.
GPS is over!
I don't think so!
You should know that Takiya
Genji isn't that kind of man!
Don't tell me...
Get everyone ready,
we're leaving as planned!
Takiya went by himself!
If he loses, we'll have to fight Housen!
Genji carries the hope of Suzuran!
There's no way he can win by himself!
The Head of Suzuran is you, Serizawa!
Did GPS send it's
underlings to beg for help?!
What?
There's no way we'd beg for help!
Then what the hell do you guys want?
Oh come on, don't be like that!
Did the super glue
heal you up Tokio-kun?
What kind of joke is this?
I came as promised!
Then go and call your men!
Don't make me laugh!
Against bastards like you,
I'm more than enough!
GO!
If he came alone, why don't you
solve this with a 'one on one'?
You're still ignorant,
if you think this is his real strength!
Look!
HEY!
Bunch of idiots!
Serizawa!
This guy!
What the hell are you guys doing here?
What?
We're the ones that will save the day!
Hey, look at that hat!
What an amazing hat!
Try not to get beaten up too much!
I don't want to carry you home!
You should worry about
yourself, bastard!
Did you really think we
wouldn't follow our Captain?
Watch closely,
young Freshman!
Takiya Genji!
Make your way to the roof top!
We'll have our 'one on one' there!
Genji!
AND STAY DOWN!
HEY! GO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!
Are you okay?!
WHO'S NEXT?!
HUMANS ARE NOT STATUES!
HEY TAKIYA! LETS GO INSIDE!
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?!
GENJI!
GO!
Read it!
What?
READ IT!
I can't read.
YOU PIECE OF SHIT!
GO! GENJI!
COME ON!
Hey!
What?
You guys can go.
This is my guest, you can
go play with anyone else!
YES!
Are you okay?
Idiot! You should worry about yourself!
Not bad for an old man!
I'm just returning what you gave me!
It's hot in here.
CHUTA!
Takiya! You go ahead! We'll
take care of things here!
Hurry up and go!
Izaki!
You better not lose to these punks!
Go mind your own business!
You guys keep coming one after another!
AND I HATE GUYS WITH BLONDE HAIR!
NO WAY IN HELL!
DID YOU THINK YOU COULD BEAT ME!
COME ON WHO'S NEXT?!
So you guys are already here!
But this is as far as you go!
What a pain in the ass.
Lets end this quickly!
We need to get to the roof top.
Hey go clear the passage!
HEY!
Hey lets go!
KILL THEM!
HEY!
THE PASSAGE IS CLEAR!
Go! I'll handle this!
Come on.
Took you long enough.
Who the hell are you?
My name is Urushibara Ryo.
Were you the one that
beat up Tsutsumoto?
I'm guarding this place.
The only person allowed through
is the man who defeated Serizawa.
Takiya.
Go ahead. I'll take on this guy!
Alright.
You better be ready.
He might be alot more
than you could handle.
So you made it!
After Suzuran is destroyed,
Bitou Makio's sould will rest in peace.
Once I defeat you, that
dream will come true!
ALRIGHT!
YES!
Narumi-san was wrong about you!
I see. I see.

It's over for you!
TAKIYA!
I've got nowhere to return!
Give me a break!
Washio!
Washio!
YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND!
Watch closely.
Hey!
Let's hurry and finish this!
Our captain shouldn't look like this.
Shut up and let me
lean on your shoulder.
Thank you for carrying
on my brother's goal.
Now it's my time to carry on your goal!
Let's go home.
Just you wait...
Suzuran!
Guess we're not coming
back to Suzuran anymore.
Last day here. We had a good run.
The era of some new guys is about to begin.
Serizawa, what are you going to do from now on?
I'm not telling you!
You better because
you still owe me money!
Not telling!
I'll never tell them.
Genji!
I bet on you.
Don't lose!
So today is the last time?
Yeah!
I won't be coming back after graduation.
So maybe I'll hold back a little!
NO NEED!
ALRIGHT!
HEY!
I guess Suzuran will be
interesting from now on!
