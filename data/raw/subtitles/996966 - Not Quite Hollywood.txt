Thanks, everyone.
We trust you have a
very pleasant evening.
THERE WAS JUST THIS CERTAIN
\h\h\h\h\h\hFLAVOR ABOUT...
\h\h\h\h\hTHE AUSSIE EXPLOITAT--
I CALL IT "AUSSIE ‘XPLOITATION."
- AHHH!
- WEIRD, WONDERFUL...
- AHHH!
- ...REALLY STRANGE MOVIES.
- ( screams )
- DOWN AND DIRTY.
- AHHH!
- VERY FAST...
AND CHEAP.
URBAN VULGARITY...
- BAD LANGUAGE...
- COP THAT, YOU ROTTEN
\h\hPOMMY BASTARD.
SOMETHING‘S GOING
\h\h\hTO BLOW UP.
...SEXUAL OVERTONES...
- AHH!
- AUSSIE BULLIES...
TERRORIZING PEOPLE.
MURDER, RAPE AND MAYHEM.
( screaming )
THRILLER, CHILLER...
- AHH.
- SLASH AND CUT AND KILL.
BAD ADVERTISEMENTS
FOR AUSTRALIA.
MOST OF THE AUSTRALIAN GENRE
FILMS WERE ACTUALLY RELEASED
\h\hIN AMERICAN, ALL RIGHT,
THROUGH EXPLOITATION HOUSES
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAND STUFF.
\h\h\hAND IT WAS ACTUALLY
COINCIDING WITH THE WHOLE
\h\hBIG AUSTRALIAN BOOM--
THE BIG AUSTRALIAN NEW WAVE--
\h\h\h\h\hTHAT WAS COMING OUT
WITH "MY BRILLIANT CAREER"
AND "THE GETTING OF WISDOM"
AND "BREAKER MORANT"
AND ALL THOSE MOVIES.
NOW WHEN THOSE MOVIES
\h\h\hWERE COMING OUT,
\hTHEY‘RE LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"THE NEW AUSTRALIAN FILM--
AUSTRALIAN CINEMA, AUSTRALIAN
\hCINEMA, AUSTRALIAN CINEMA."
THAT WAS LIKE THE KEY WORD
\h\hFOR INDEPENDENT CINEMA.
\h\h\h\h\hBUT THE AUSTRALIAN
\h\h\h\h\hGENRE FILMS WEREN‘T
BEING TOUTED AS AUSSIE FILMS.
I DIDN‘T KNOW THEY WERE
AUSSIE GENRE FILMS UNTIL
\h\h\hI BOUGHT MY TICKET
AND THEY OPENED
\hTHEIR MOUTHS.
COME ON, MAN,
\h\hSHOOT ME!
YOU FINISHED
THE KANGAROO OFF!
SHOOT ME!

PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING
\h\hABOUT AUSTRALIA
EXCEPT WHAT IS HANDED OUT
\hIN THE TRAVEL BROCHURES,
WHICH DOESN‘T REALLY INDUCE
PEOPLE TO COME TO AUSTRALIA
BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT SO MANY
\h\h\h\h\hPEOPLE IN THE WORLD
WHO ARE THAT INTERESTED IN
KANGAROOS AND KOALA BEARS.
THE LATE ‘60s AND THEN
\h\h\h\hTHE EARLY ‘70s
\hWAS A SEISMIC MOMENT
IN AUSTRALIA CULTURALLY
\h\h\hAND POLITICALLY.
\hPEOPLE DIDN‘T WANT TO BE
CONTROLLED BY GOVERNMENTS
\h\hAND BY THE STATUS QUO.
THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN
A DESPERATE SITUATION.
\hAND THEY CAN‘T AFFORD
TO SIT WITH THEIR HANDS
\h\h\h\hFOLDED ANYMORE.
\hFEMINISM WAS JUST BEGINNING
TO FRACTURE THE RELATIONSHIPS
\h\h\h\hBETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
Germaine Greer writes, "Women
\hshould seek a revolution."
- THERE WAS A LOT OF
\hOPPOSITION TO THE WAR.
- ( machine gunfire )
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE
TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY
WHERE THEY WERE CONSCRIPTING
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWITH A LOTTERY.
WE WERE INVOLVED IN
\h\hTHE MORATORIUM.
- APARTHEID.
- STANDING UP AND SAYING
\hTHINGS ABOUT ABORTION.
- ( chanting )
- Rod Mullinar: D IN
\h\hNUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.
WE FELT WE WERE PART OF
\hTHE REBELLION THAT WAS
\h\hSTARTING WORLDWIDE.
\hWE CERTAINLY
HAD THE IDEAS
\h\h\hTHAT WE COULD
CHANGE EVERYTHING.
\h\hAND YOU COULD DO THAT
AS WELL AS GETTING STONED
\h\h\h\hOUT OF YOUR MIND.
THERE WAS A YOUNG ARISTOCRACY
\h\h\hWHICH WERE RULING THINGS
AND PREFERRING FORNICATION
\h\h\h\h\hAND HALLUCINATION
TO WHAT HAD PRECEDED.
IF YOU WEREN‘T WILD,
\h\hYOU WEREN‘T HIP.
IT WAS A TREMENDOUS ENERGY
AND THAT CARRIED OVER INTO
\h\h\hTHE ARTS GENERALLY.
\hI NEVER THOUGHT THAT AUSTRALIA
WAS A PLACE THAT NEEDED CULTURE
OF ANY DESCRIPTION, BUT WE DID
\h\h\hFEEL WE HAD TO HAVE IT--
WE HAD TO HAVE AN OPERA HOUSE--
SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE STAMPS.
AND SLOWLY OF COURSE,
\h\hIT BEGAN TO GROW.
AND IT ONLY REALLY GROWS
\h\hON DECAYING THINGS,
\h\h\h\hBECAUSE CULTURE IS,
AFTER ALL, CHEESE, ISN‘T IT?
OR YOGURT?
TODAY THERE‘S NO INDUSTRY
\h\h\h\h\hIN THIS COUNTRY
MAKING FEATURE FILMS.
WE RANK WITH ECUADOR
\h\h\h\h\hAND ICELAND
WHICH, LIKE US, ARE AMONG
THE GREAT NON-FILMMAKERS.
BUT THERE ARE SIGNS THAT
\hWE MIGHT HAVE FOUND OUR
\hDORMANT FILM INDUSTRY.
THE GREAT CINEMATIC SILENCE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN AUSTRALIA
\hWAS OCCASIONALLY BROKEN
BY AN INTERNATIONAL CREW
\hWHO WOULD WANDER IN AND TRY
AND MAKE AN AUSTRALIAN FILM.
\hTED KOTCHEFF CAME IN AND MADE
A FILM CALLED "WAKE IN FRIGHT."
\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
This is John Grant,
a handsome, intelligent
\hyoung schoolteacher.
This is John Grant,
an ugly, sweaty,
desperate animal.
What happened to
\h\h\hJohn Grant?
The Outback happened
\h\h\hto John Grant.
IT WAS A SLOWLY DEVELOPING
\hNIGHTMARE OF DRINKING...
FIGHTING, SHOOTING,
HUNTING KANGAROOS.
AUSTRALIANS AT THE TIME DIDN‘T
WANT TO SEE IT AS AUSTRALIAN.
\h\h\h\h\hPEOPLE WALKED AWAY
\h\hSAYING, "THAT‘S NOT US.
WE DON‘T BEHAVE LIKE THAT."
AS A FOREIGNER,
\hYOU SEE THINGS
WHICH AUSTRALIANS TAKE
\h\h\h\h\h\hFOR GRANTED
\h\h\h\hOR ACCEPT AS PART OF
THE DAILYNESS OF THEIR LIFE.
\h\h\hTHEY DON‘T SEE WHAT‘S
ECCENTRIC OR IDIOSYNCRATIC
\h\h\h\h\hABOUT THEIR LIFE.
( all chanting )
\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
Thank you, ladies
\hand gentlemen.
AND THE EARLY EFFECT
THAT THE FRONTIER HAS
ON THOSE WHO SEE THEMSELVES
\hAS CIVILIZED EUROPEANS...
\h\h\hPhillip Adams:
IF IT HADN‘T BEEN FOR
\h\h\hTHESE INVADERS
TELLING US SOMETHING ABOUT
\h\h\h\hWHAT WE LOOKED LIKE
AND WHAT OUR LANDSCAPES
\h\h\h\h\hLOOKED LIKE,
OUR CULTURAL ANONYMITY
WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTER.
\hWHAT THEY PROVIDED WAS
A KNOWLEDGE FOR WOULD-BE
\hAUSTRALIAN FILMMAKERS
THAT WE HAD THE ABILITY
\h\h\h\h\hTO TELL TALES
\h\hABOUT OURSELVES IN
A WAY THAT WAS DYNAMIC
\h\h\hAND INTERESTING.
WE WERE REALLY VERY LUCKY
\hTHAT WE HAD AT
THE RIGHT TIME,
AT THE RIGHT PLACE, TWO PEOPLE
\h\hWHO WERE DEEPLY COMMITTED
TO THE IDEA OF AN AUSTRALIAN
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hFILM CULTURE.
\h\hIF YOU COULD SHOW A HINT OF
CREATIVE ABILITY IN AUSTRALIA,
SUDDENLY YOU WERE BEING
\h\h\hLAVISHLY FUNDED.
THE GOVERNMENT‘S SHELLING OUT
PILES OF BLOODY MOOLAH
FOR ANY BASTARD WHO RECKONS
HE CAN PAINT PICTURES,
WRITE POEMS OR MAKE FILMS.
\hAND THE WHOLE
THING TOOK OFF.
( game theme playing )
( crowds cheering )
\h\hPhillip Adams:
I GOT A FUNNY IDEA
ABOUT MAKING A FILM
ON AUSTRALIAN SEXUALITY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
"LES-BI-ANISM"?
LES--
I‘M AFRAID I DON‘T
UNDERSTAND MEDICAL TERMS.
\hTHE IDEA WAS TO HAVE
A DR. KINSEY CHARACTER
WANDERING AROUND
\h\hTAKING NOTES.
\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
\h\h\hHe saw sex as
Australia sees it.
He talks with the madam
\h\h\h\hof a brothel...
I USED TO BE A PROS--
\h\hPROSTITUTE MYSELF.
BUT OLD AGE AND...
EVERYTHING CAUGHT UP
\h\h\h\h\h\hWITH ME.
...with fashion models,
photographers, the guy
\h\h\hon the street...
THE FILM WAS CONSTANTLY POUNCED
ON BY CENSORSHIP AUTHORITIES
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAT EVERY LEVEL.
EVENTUALLY WHEN IT WAS SHOWN,
\h\hMANY SEQUENCES WERE CUT.
I‘D BE TERRIFIED
TO SLEEP WITH A MAN.
I WOULDN‘T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.
AND THE DIRECTOR,
\hJOHN B. MURRAY,
INCLUDED DRAWINGS OF
\h\h\hA NAKED BUNYIP
TO SIGNAL THE SHOTS THAT
\h\h\hHAD BEEN TAKEN OUT.
THE BUNYIP WOULD LEAP
\hAND CAVORT AND DANCE
\h\h\h\hON THE SCREEN.
AND THE AUDIENCE WENT WILD.
\hTHEY MUCH PREFERRED THOSE
\h\h\h\h\hPARTS OF THE FILM
\h\h\hTHAT ONLY HAD
THE BUNYIP IN THEM.
\hAUSTRALIAN CENSORSHIP
WAS THE MOST REPRESSIVE
\h\h\h\hANYWHERE IN
THE WESTERN WORLD.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
IF YOU HAPPENED TO SEE
\h\h\h\h\hBREASTS BARE,
AND CERTAINLY IF YOU SAW
\h\h\h\h\h\hPUBIC HAIR,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU‘D JUST
ABOUT FALL OUT OF YOUR SEAT.
\h\hWE HAD IN AUSTRALIA
IN THOSE DAYS A CENSOR--
A MAN CALLED PROUSE.
I DIDN‘T KNOW ANYTHING
\h\h\h\hABOUT HIM MUCH,
EXCEPT THAT HE HAD ONE ARM.
\hPROWSE COULDN‘T MASTURBATE AS
EASILY AS PERHAPS OTHERS COULD.
AND WHEN I WAS INVOLVED
\h\hIN CENSORSHIP ROWS,
BARRY HUMPHRIES WOULD THROW
PRESS CONFERENCES AND SAY--
"I WAS SORRY MR. PROUSE
\h\h\h\hCOULDN‘T ATTEND,
\h\hBUT I HAD HEARD THAT
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS
RIGHT ARM TO BE THERE."
I THINK IT WAS THE ADVENT
\hOF DON CHIPP AS MINISTER
\h\h\h\h\h\hOF THE CUSTOMS
THAT LEAD TO SOME SLACKENING
\h\h\hOF THE CENSORSHIP LAWS.
\h\h\h\hI HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY
HAPPY STAY IN AUSTRALIA, SIR.
I THINK COMMUNITY
STANDARDS CHANGE.
\h\hAND THE CENSORSHIP
PHILOSOPHIES FOLLOW IT.
\h\h\h\hHE PIONEERED
THE "R" CERTIFICATE.
\h\hTHE "R" RATING ALLOWED
MUCH MORE EXPLICIT VIOLENCE
AND MUCH MORE
EXPLICIT SEX.
\hAND SUDDENLY, IT WAS
ON FOR YOUNG AND OLD.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
It‘s the bawdiest, craziest,
\h\h\h\hmost hilarious comedy
you‘ve ever seen!
AS I COME TOWARDS YOU,
I STUFF THE SMOKED OYSTER
UP MY NOSTRIL LIKE THIS.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hEXCUSE ME, MADAM,
BUT HAVE YOU GOT A HANDKERCHIEF?
\h\h\h"STORK" WAS THE VERY FIRST
OF THE SO-CALLED OCKER COMEDIES.
\h\hAND HOW‘S THE MOLE
SITUATION AROUND HERE?
\hTHERE WAS A LOT OF FRANKNESS
ABOUT THE MORALS OF THE TIME,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI THINK.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWHOO-HAA!
THE OLD MÉNAGE À TROIS, EH?
BUT SOMEHOW IT DOESN‘T
COME ACROSS AS DIRTY.
ARE YOU A VIRGIN, STORK?
\h\h\h\h\hTim Burstall:
TO EVERYONE‘S AMAZEMENT,
"STORK" TURNED OUT TO BE
THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN
\hCOMMERCIAL SUCCESS
IN SOMETHING LIKE
\h\h\h\h15 YEARS.
\h\hDavid Williamson:
IT WAS A TURNING POINT
\h\hIN AUSTRALIAN FILMS
BEING ACCEPTED AS POSSIBLY
\h\h\h\h\hBEING SOMETHING
THAT AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE
\h\h\h\hWANTED TO SEE.
NOT SO MANY YEARS AGO, IF YOU‘D
ASKED AN OVERSEAS RESIDENT
\hWHAT THEY THOUGHT
TYPIFIED AUSTRALIA,
\h\h\h\h\hTHE CHANCES ARE
THEY‘D PROBABLY SAY, UM...
A KANGAROO OR A KOALA.
NOW THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY
\h\h\h\hMORE LIKELY TO BE
\h\h\h\h\hOUR SELF-PROCLAIMED
NATIONAL HERO BAZZA McKENZIE.
\hBarry Humphries:
BARRY McKENZIE WAS
\h\h\hAN AUSTRALIAN
\h\h\hLOOKING FOR
SEXUAL ADVENTURES
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
\h\hFEARFUL OF THEM.
\h\h\h\h\hBarry Jones:
A SIMPLE CHARACTER WHO
\h\h\h\h\hFINDS HIMSELF
IN THE FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED
\h\h\h\h\h\hMILIEU OF LONDON.
WE TRIED TO MAKE ENGLAND LOOK
\h\h\h\h\hAS BAD AS POSSIBLE.
THAT‘S NOT DIFFICULT.
LIKE IT?
ONE COAT OF DULUX DONE THIS.
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
THAT THERE BE A LOT OF
\hDOGSHIT EVERYWHERE.
I‘D EVEN WRITTEN A SONG:
\h"LOOK OUT FOR POOP ON
\h\h\h\h\hTHE PAVEMENT.
DON‘T BE CAUGHT
\hTAKING A NAP.
THE BUILDINGS MAY BE
\h\hOLD AND HISTORIC,
\h\h\hBUT THE STREETS
ARE PAVED WITH CRAP."
BLOODY DOG CRAP!
NEARLY BREAK MY LEG ON
THAT ALSATIAN‘S VISITING CARD.
\hTHERE ARE A FEW FIRSTS
IN THE "McKENZIE" FILM,
AND I THINK THE VOMITING SCENE
\h\h\h\h\hIS THE MOST SEMINAL.
\hI EVEN MIXED
THE CHUNDER...
WHICH MOSTLY CAME OUT OF
\h\hA TIN OF CORN SOUP.
- PEA SOUP...
- FRUIT SALADS...
...AUGMENTED BY A CERTAIN
\hAMOUNT OF POTATO SALAD.
IT NEEDS LEMONADE
TO GIVE IT A FIZZ.
I REMEMBER BARRY SAYING,
\h\h\h"MAKE SURE YOU GET
A COUPLE SHREDS OF
\hTOMATO IN THERE.
THAT‘S ALWAYS PRESENT."
WE HAD ONE CHUNDER SCENE
\h\hIN THE FIRST MOVIE.
\h\hWE WERE COPIED
IN "THE EXORCIST."
I‘M NOT SUING.
I THOUGHT, "WELL, WE‘LL HAVE TO
\hHAVE TWO IN OUR NEXT MOVIE."
- WE HAVE. R SCENE
- AHHHH!
ONE OF THE SCENES
\hTHAT I TREASURE
\h\h\h\h\hWAS TO HAVE
BARRY McKENZIE VOMIT
\hFROM THE TOP OF
THE EIFFEL TOWER.
GOT A FUNNY FEELING
IN ME NED KELLY
I‘M GONNA CRY RUTH.
THE PEOPLE ARE PUZZLED BY THIS:
"CRY RUTH"?
\h\h\h\hHE LEANS OVER,
YOU HEAR HIM CALLING,
"RU-- RUTH!"
RUUUUTH!
NAUSEATING EVEN
TO THINK ABOUT.
\h\h\hIT IS ONE OF
THE GREAT MOMENTS
IN THE AUSTRALIAN CINEMA.
AND IF THERE‘D BEEN MORE OF IT
\hIN "PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK,"
\h\hIT WOULD HAVE BEEN
AN EVEN GREATER FILM.
HOW COME A GOOD-LOOKING
CLEAN-CUT AUSTRALIAN LIKE ME
GETS SO MANY KNOCKBACKS
WHEN SOME DIRTY, GREASY,
IKEY-MO-STYLE BASTARD
LIKE YOU
SCORES IT FOR
A KNEE-TREMBLER WITH
AN ABO IN AN AIRBORNE DUNNY?
HOMOPHOBIA AND RACISM
\h\hCAN BE CHARMING...
JEEZ, IF IT WAS RAINING VIRGINS,
I‘D BE WASHED DOWN THE GUTTER
WITH THE POOFTERS.
- ...DELIGHTFUL...
- WHAT A SWEET LITTLE
\hTINTED PERSON.
- ...ESSENTIAL.
- I WILL NOT HEAR ANYONE
\hATTACKING THEM.
THIS-- THIS MAKES US
\h\h\h\hWHO WE ARE.
\h\h\hWE DID HAVE
A CLASSIFICATION--
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h"N.P.A.
NO POOFTERS ALLOWED."
\h\h\hHOW MANY TIMES
I TOLD YOU, RHONDA,
\h\hNOT TO BRING ANY OF THEM
MALE-MODEL POOFTERS OF YOURS
THROUGH OUR PRIVATE QUARTERS?
\hESPECIALLY THE AUSTRALIANS!
THEY ARE THE BIGGEST
POOFTERS OF THEM ALL.
YESSAH!
\hPhillip Adams:
BARRY HAD ALWAYS
LOATHED AND DETESTED
THE AUSTRALIAN OCKER.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMen singing:
♪ ...THROUGH AND THROUGH... ♪
\h\h\h\h\h\hTO HIS HORROR,
THE PEOPLE HE MOST LOATHED
\h\h\hMOST LOVED THE FILM.
Man: Are you happy to have
a girl with you when
you see this movie?
Aw, yeah.
Like the song says, you know,
put your sheila in a frenzy.
Oh, I‘m prepared, you know,
\h\h\h\h\hto be Australian.
\h\hIt makes me feel
like I‘m Australian.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
\h\h\h\h\hYeah, I reckon
he‘s a true-blue Aussie.
LOOK, THERE ARE ALWAYS
\h\h\hMORONS WHO SEE
SATIRE AS DOCUMENTARY.
\h\hTHEY THOUGHT IT WAS
AN ENDORSEMENT OF THEIR
\h\h\h\h\hWAY OF LIFE.
\hIN FACT, IN A FUNNY KIND
OF WAY, I SUPPOSE IT WAS.
\h\hIT WAS CERTAINLY
QUITE AFFECTIONATE.
I‘VE BEEN SPEAKING TO SOME
OF MY MATES--
SOPHISTICATED MATES IN
THE FILM PRODUCTION BUSINESS.
AND THEY RECKON THIS IS
\h\h\hTHE TYPE OF SHOW
THAT‘S GIVEN AUSTRALIA
\h\hWORLD LEADERSHIP IN
FILM PRODUCTION TODAY.
SO I BELIEVE, BARRY.
DID YOU KNOW THE CRITICS
HAVE GONE ABSOLUTELY BERSERK?
A THIRD- OR FOURTH-RATE
NASTY LITTLE MOVIE.
IT WAS LOATHSOME, REALLY.
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
IT‘S JUST HORRIBLE.
IT‘S UGLY AND CLUTTERED
AND UNPLEASANT.
- SMUTTY...
- I MAY BE OLD-FASHIONED,
\hYOUNG WOMAN,
BUT LESBIANISM HAS
ALWAYS LEFT A NASTY TASTE
IN MY MOUTH.
- ...UN-AUSTRALIAN...
- IS IT TRUE THAT
\hALL AUSTRALIANS
ARE HOMOSEXUALS?
NO, MATE,
THAT‘S JUST A RUMOR
SPREAD BY THE AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT TO ATTRACT
POMMY MIGRANTS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS PERHAPS
\h\h\h\hTOO AUSTRALIAN.
\h\h\h\hWE WEREN‘T MAKING
A FILM FOR THE AUSTRALIAN
\h\h\hTOURIST COMMISSION.
IF YOU CAN‘T SATIRIZE YOURSELF,
YOU HAVE NO IDENTITY.
\h\h\h\hI THINK THAT‘S
A VERY IMPORTANT FILM.
SOCIETY WAS CHANGING--
\h\h\hTHE PERCEPTION
OF SOCIAL VALUES...
AND POLITICAL VALUES
\h\h\hWAS CHANGING.
"LET THE LEGAL BARRIERS
\h\hAGAINST PORNOGRAPHY
BE SWEPT AWAY.
\hLET‘S ABOLISH THE CENSORS,"
THEY SAY, "AND HAVE OUR FUN."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPERHAPS IN THE
TELEVISION FIELD, AUSTRALIA
LED THE WORLD WITH
\h\h\h"NUMBER 96."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDeborah Gray:
\h\h"NUMBER 96" WAS A MAJOR,
VERY SUCCESSFUL TOP-10 SHOW.
\h\h\hSandy Harbutt:
IT TURNED TELEVISION
\h\h\h\h\hON ITS HEAD
BECAUSE IT WAS
\hALL SHOCKING.
AHHH!
THAT KIND OF LIBERATION
WENT THROUGH TO FILMS
\h\h\h\h\h\hAS WELL.
IT‘S JUST DE RIGUEUR TO HAVE
\h\hAT LEAST ONE NUDE SCENE.
"THE NUDE NEXT DOOR,"
\hI GOT DUBBED A LOT.
IT WAS A STANCE
\hOF LIBERATION.
\hWendy Hughes:
\hIT WAS ACTUALLY
A WAY OF SAYING,
"I AM WHO I AM,
\hAND LOOK OUT."
\h\h\h\h\hTHE AUSTRALIAN GIRL IS
JUSTIFIABLY PROUD OF HER FIGURE.
SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE--
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIT‘S LOVELY.
NUDITY WAS NO ISSUE
\h\h\hIN THIS PERIOD
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO BE NUDE.
IT‘S THE IN THING
\hTO TODDLE AROUND
WITH JUST THE BOTTOM HALVES
\h\h\h\h\h\hOF YOUR BATHERS.
AND IF YOU‘RE WEARING YOUR TOP,
YOU‘RE DEFINITELY OUT.
EVERYONE WAS FLASHING THEIR...
\h\h\hEVERYTHING AND WHATNOT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGraeme Blundell:
PEOPLE WERE NUDE IN THE STREET;
\h\h\h\hTHEY WERE NUDE AT HOME;
THEY WERE NUDE
\h\hAT PARTIES.
ANYONE FOR STRIP POKER?
\h\h\hWOMEN ARE PROUD
OF THEIR BIG BODIES;
\hMEN ARE PROUD OF
THEIR BEER BELLIES.
IT WAS JUST A CELEBRATION
\h\h\h\h\hOF FLESHINESS.
THERE WERE CERTAIN ELEMENTS--
\h\hVERY CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS
IN AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY
THAT WERE ALARMED BY
\h\hTHE NEW FREEDOMS.
Man:
YOU‘VE WARNED THAT CIVILIZATION
COULD FACE DISASTER
IF MORALITY CONTINUES
TO BE DEGRADED.
HOW LONG HAVE WE GOT,
IN FACT?
WELL, I‘VE HAD DISCUSSIONS
\h\h\h\hWITH LORD LONGFORD
AND MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE,
\hAND THEY GIVE A PERIOD
\h\h\h\h\h\hOF 10 YEARS.
I WAS WAITING KEENLY
FOR THE MORAL DECAY
AND IT DIDN‘T HAPPEN AS BADLY
\h\h\h\hAS THEY SAID IT WOULD,
BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH AROUND
\h\hTO MAKE IT INTERESTING.
♪ ALVIN... ♪
\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
"Alvin Purple" was shot
\h\h\hearlier this year
by Australia‘s leading
filmmaker Tim Burstall.
"ALFIE" WITH MICHAEL CAINE
\h\h\hWAS OUT AT THE TIME.
- AND I DID A REVERSE
\h\hSITUATION-- T WOULD,
- ALVIN?
ALVIN WAS A VICTIM.
- ALVIN.
- THE WOMEN BECAME
\hTHE PREDATORS.
TIM SAID THEY WANT TO HAVE
SOMEONE PLAYING THIS ROLE
WHO‘S NOT AN OBVIOUS STUD.
IF YOU CAST A REAL STUD
AS YOUR LEAD,
ALL THE MALES WOULD HATE HIM
FOR BEING SO MASTERFUL
AND GETTING OFF
WITH EVERYBODY;
\h\hALL THE FEMALES WOULD
FEEL RESENTFUL, YOU KNOW,
"I‘D NEVER COME ACROSS
TO A FIGURE LIKE THAT."
\h\h\h\h\hGRAEME BLUNDELL
WAS PERFECT FOR IT BECAUSE
\hHE LOOKED LIKE EVERYMAN.
HE BECAME ONE OF OUR
\h\hFIRST MEGASTARS.
\h\h\h\h\hGraeme Blundell:
IT WAS QUITE EXCITING TO BE
\h\hAT THE CENTER OF THAT,
BUT ALSO DAUNTING TO HAVE TO
COPE WITH IT IN MY REAL LIFE.
PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME
\h\h\h\h\hWHEREVER I WAS--
\h"THAT‘S MY WIFE OVER THERE,
MATE. SHE WANTS TO-- HEH HEH--
\h\h\h\hTALK TO YOU!"
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
\h\h\hI DIDN‘T REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL
IN SOME JEALOUS,
POSSESSIVE WAY.
\hMY MARRIAGE BROKE UP.
MY WIFE WAS A PIONEERING
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hFEMINIST,
\hSO OBVIOUSLY SHE WASN‘T
GOING TO LIVE WITH ALL OF
\h\h\h\h\hTHE SHENANIGANS
\hTHAT FOLLOWED THE CHARACTER
OF ALVIN PURPLE IN REAL LIFE.
THERE ARE VERY FEW ACTRESSES
\h\h\h\h\h\hOF MY GENERATION
WHO WEREN‘T TITS AND ASS
\h\hON AN "ALVIN" FILM.
DID YOU LEAVE IN A HURRY
\hFOR WORK THIS MORNING?
GIRLS WHO HAVE BECOME
\h\h\h\h\h\hQUITE PRIM
\h\hARE BOLLOCKY
AND ENJOYING IT.
APPARENTLY ON VERY LOW WAGES,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI WOULD SUGGEST,
SINCE BURSTALL WAS INVOLVED.
\h\h\hTIM LOVED GETTING TIT IN
THE SHOT IF HE POSSIBLY COULD.
- I MEAN, THAT WAS
\h\hTHE NAME OF THE GAME.
- IT WAS ALL FOR THE ART.
I BELIEVE THAT TIM ACTUALLY
\h\h\h\hMAY HAVE ENCOURAGED
SOME OF THE ACTRESSES
TO BE A LITTLE MORE DARING
\hIN TERMS OF THE CLOTHING
THAT THEY SHED BY GIVING THEM
\h\h\hADDITIONAL REMUNERATION
\h\h\h\h\hIN ORDER TO MAKE
THEIR WELL-BEING HEALTHIER
\h\h\h\h\hAND MORE STABLE.
TIM BURSTALL DID NOT BRIBE ME
\h\h\h\h\h\hTO SHOW MORE TIT.
YOU COULDN‘T HAVE SEEN MORE
\h\h\h\h\hTHAN WHAT YOU GOT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRob Copping:
I CAN REMEMBER TIM OFFERING
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJACKI WEAVER
\h\h$500 I THINK IT WAS,
\h\hCASH, JUST TO GO OUT
AND TAKE HER CLOTHES OFF.
\hAND JACKI SAID,
"HOW MUCH? OKAY."
BIG BUDGET.
I REMEMBER ON ONE OCCASION
\h\hSAYING TO JOHN SEALE,
"HOW WAS IT?" AND HE SAID,
\h\h\h"VERY HARD TO JUDGE.
THE EYEPIECE WAS
\hCOMPLETELY...
MISTED OVER."
THE EYEPIECE FOGGED UP
\h\h\hQUITE REGULARLY.
\h\h\h\hTim Burstall:
\h\h"BY GOD," HE SAID,
"THAT‘S STEAMY STUFF."
YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD LAUGH;
\h\h\hYOU WANT TO SEE A LITTLE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBIT OF BOOBS,
AND THAT GAVE IT ALL.
\hIT WAS A HIT OF QUITE
ASTRONOMIC PROPORTIONS.
THE BUDGET WAS $200,000
AND IT TOOK $5 MILLION.
\h\h\hTO SEE THOSE HUGE
QUEUES AROUND THE BLOCK
\h\h\hKNOWING THAT IT WAS
A HIGHLY-PROFITABLE FILM
WAS A HUGE BOOST
TO THE INDUSTRY.
\hI WORKED WITH
ROBERT ALDRICH,
\h\hROBERT ALTMAN
AND TIM BURSTALL.
\h\h\hAND ALL OF THEM HAVE THAT
WONDERFUL QUALITY OF VULGARITY.
\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
Out of our rollicking,
\h\h\h\hpassionate past
\hcomes a story so bawdy,
so brilliantly beautiful,
so breathtakingly
\h\h\hexciting...
thank goodness it happened
\h\h\h\h\h\h140 years ago.
TIM WANTED TO MAKE A FILM
\h\h\h\hABOUT ELIZA FRASER
BUT HE DIDN‘T WANT A DEADLY
SERIOUS ANGST-RIDDEN PIECE.
\h\hIT WAS TO BE A ROMP WITH
BAWDINESS BEING THE KEYWORD.
\hNO DOUBT ABOUT IT
THAT "ELIZA FRASER"
WAS A HUGE GRAND MIXTURE, G
\h\h\h\hA GREAT POTPOURRI.
\h\hI SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT
\hHAVE BEEN BECAUSE THE
AUSTRALIAN FILM INDUSTRY
\h\h\hWAS SEARCHING
FOR A WAY FORWARD.
AND IN TIM THEY FOUND
\hTHE PERFECT PERSON
WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO
\hPROVIDE A BIT OF EVERYTHING.
\h\h\h\h\hBob Ellis:
HE WAS SCUM, REALLY.
\h\hHE WAS THE CRAB LOUSE ON
THE AUSTRALIAN FILM INDUSTRY.
\h\hON THE OTHER HAND,
ALL OF US WILL ALWAYS
\hOWE HIM EVERYTHING.
\h\h\h\h\h\hRob Copping:
HE WAS THE PERSON WHO WAS
\h\h\h\hMOST RESPONSIBLE
FOR GETTING THE RENAISSANCE
\h\h\hUNDERWAY AT THAT TIME.
IF TIM BURSTALL
\h\hHAD ENERGY,
\h\h\hJOHN LAMOND
HAD UBER ENERGY.
JOHN HAD A GREAT KNACK
OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PUBLIC
WAS INTO AT THE TIME.
\h\hA BIT OF CRUDITY
AND A BIT OF NUDITY.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
We will explore the weird,
\h\h\hthe erotic, the ugly,
\h\h\h\hthe obscene
and the beautiful;
A strange and sometimes
\h\h\h\hdisturbing trip
around darkest Australia.
I SPENT ABOUT A YEAR
\hGATHERING MATERIAL
ON PEOPLE WHO SWAM AROUND
\h\hNAKED UNDERWATER AND
\h\hFILMED TROPICAL FISH.
THERE WAS A MAD BASTARD
\h\hWHO USED TO CONDUCT
\h\h\hORCHESTRAL MUSIC
\hAND PAINT HIS WOMEN DIFFERENT
COLORS AND MAKE A NAKED MURAL.
\h\h\h\h\hTHERE WAS A LADY IN
KINGS CROSS NAMED MADAM LASH.
- LASH IS READY!
- Man: OH, LOOK AT THAT RACK.
YOU DON‘T SEE CRAFTSMANSHIP
\h\h\hLIKE THAT THESE DAYS.
\h\hIT WAS HAPPENING
FOR REAL AROUND US.
\hWE WERE SEEING THINGS
I‘VE NEVER SEEN AGAIN--
I WOULDN‘T MIND SEEING AGAIN,
\h\hBUT I‘VE NEVER SEEN AGAIN.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
Black witchcraft ceremonies
are weird and frightening.
We witnessed such a ceremony
\h\hin the middle of a forest
not far from Melbourne.
\h\hPEOPLE WERE QUITE SHOCKED.
THEY SAID, "DEVIL WORSHIPPERS
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN MELBOURNE!
I CAN‘T-- OH, THIS IS--"
\h\h\h\h\hAND JOHN SAID,
"I CAN‘T TELL YOU
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THEY‘LL PUT A HEX ON ME.
\h\h\h\hI‘LL BE CURSED."
\h\h\h\hI SAID, "TELL!
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME."
\h\h\h\hHE SAID, "IT WAS IN
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW‘S BACKYARD.
AND IT WAS ALL MY MATES
\h\hAND A MIST MACHINE,
\hAND WE HIRED SOME BIRD
TO WRITHE ON THE ALTAR."
\hAFTER KINGS CROSS,
YOU RAN OUT OF VICE.
SO WE HAD TO SORT OF CREATE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPHONY VICE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJohn Lamond:
"JAWS" WAS ON AT ONE THEATER
\h\h\h\h\h\hAND 14 DRIVE-INS
AND WE WENT IN THE NEXT WEEK
\h\h\h\hAND WE TOOK AS MUCH.
Drive-in announcer:
Information for those
who are attending the drive-in
\h\h\h\h\h\hfor the first time:
\h\h\h\hThe following hints
will make you feel at home
and add to your enjoyment.
IF YOU GO FROM ONE END OF
\hAUSTRALIA TO THE OTHER,
THERE USED TO BE SOMETHING
LIKE 400 DRIVE-IN SCREENS.
BOTH AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA,
BECAUSE WE BOTH FETISHIZED
\h\hAND BUILT AROUND CARS,
\h\h\hACTUALLY HAVE
A DRIVE-IN CULTURE.
Lamond: I CAN SEE THAT THERE‘S
\h\h\h\h\h\hA GREAT POSSIBILITY
\h\h\h\h\hFOR AUSTRALIAN FILMS
\h\h\h\h\h\hTO GET ON THERE.
I MEAN, IF THEY COULDN‘T WIN
SORT OF THE JOCKSTRAP AWARD
AT THE KRAKOW FILM FESTIVAL,
\hTHEY CAN MOST CERTAINLY
FILL THE GAP WITH SOME OF
\hTHE DRIVE-IN AUDIENCES.
\h\h\h\hWoman:
Sink your teeth
\hinto one now.
( all vomiting )
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
\hNow for the first time ever
on the motion-picture screen,
we bring you a revealing
\hand light-hearted look
\h\hbetween the sheets at
modern-day sex and love.
WE SAT AROUND ONE SATURDAY
AFTERNOON AND KNOCKED OUT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAN IDEA FOR
"A.B.C. OF LOVE AND SEX."
WHAT WE DELIBERATELY SET OUT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO AVOID
WAS TEXTBOOK DOCUMENTARY.
\h\hJohn-Michael Howson:
JOHN LAMOND CONVINCED ME
I SHOULD BE IN THIS FILM
\hPLAYING SOMEBODY WHO
WAS DRESSED IN LEATHER.
\h\h\h\hOOH!
OUTRAGEOUS.
EVERYBODY WAS STANDING AROUND
\h\h\hIN THEIR DRESSING GOWNS
AND THEY TOOK
DEEP BREATHS.
AND EVERYBODY LIFTED UP,
THEIR STOMACHS WENT IN,
AND WE GOT INTO
\h\h\hTHE ORGY.
\h\hBUT YOU WOULDN‘T WANT
TO HAVE AN ORGY WITH ANY
\h\h\h\hOF THESE PEOPLE.
- YOU WOULD HAVE RUN! on:
- WE DID RATHER GO OUT OF
\hOUR WAY TO BE CONTROVERSIAL.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnnouncer:
The vagina is a remarkable
\h\h\h\h\h\herogenous zone,
and because of
its elasticity,
can accommodate various
\h\h\h\hsizes of penis.
JOHN COULD COOK THIS STUFF UP,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAND HE REALIZED
IF YOU HAD NUBILE YOUNG LADIES
\h\h\h\h\h\hSOAPING EACH OTHER
\h\hUNDER A SHOWER, YOU‘RE
PROBABLY GOING TO ATTRACT
SOME SORT OF AN AUDIENCE.
\h\hAnnouncer:
Meet Felicity.
She‘s the world‘s cheekiest,
spunkiest, sexiest new girl.
I LOOKED AT THE SCRIPT
\h\h\h\hAND I THOUGHT,
"OOH, THIS IS
\hA BIT HOT."
\h\h\h\hJohn Lamond:
"FELICITY" STARTS OFF
IN A CONVENT SCHOOL,
\hBECAUSE I‘VE ALWAYS HEARD
\hTHAT PEOPLE WHO COME FROM
DEVOUT CATHOLIC BACKGROUNDS
\h\hARE THE HORNIEST ONES
WHEN THEY GET A GO AT IT.
I WAS VERY WOMEN‘S LIB
\hWHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
I MEAN IT‘S AMAZING,
\h\hIN A WAY, THAT I
\h\hDID THIS MOVIE,
EXCEPT THAT THE MOVIE IS
\h\h\hACTUALLY PRO-WOMEN.
MILES, I FEEL
SO HORNY.
JUST WATCH THIS BIT.
\h\h\hTHERE IS SOME
MALE FANTASY IN IT.
\h\h\h\h\h\hJohn Lamond:
THE NUMBER ONE FANTASY OF
\h\h\h\h\hALL THE PEOPLE
WHO GO TO SEE THESE FILMS,
\hAND NOT JUST THE BLOKES,
IS THE LESBIAN SCENE.
\h\hI THINK TWO GIRLS LYING DOWN
TOGETHER THAT AREN‘T LESBIANS--
\h\hTHAT‘S SORT OF
MORE MALE FANTASY.
\hGLORIA DOESN‘T LIKE
LESBIAN SEX IN FILMS,
\h\hAND I CAN‘T SPEAK
FOR THE PRIVATE PART.
I CAN SAY IN MY DEFENSE THAT
LESBIAN THINGS REALLY HAPPEN.
John-Michael Howson:
AND OF COURSE IT WAS
EVEN MORE INTERESTING
IF THE LESBIANS
\hWERE GORGEOUS,
\hNOT LADIES THAT LOOKED LIKE
THEY MAY DRIVE A MACK TRUCK.
\h\h\h\h\hIT‘S CONTRIVED BUT
THAT DOESN‘T MEAN IT‘S BAD.
JOHN KNEW THAT OUT THERE
THERE WERE ENOUGH PEOPLE
\hTHAT WANTED TO
SEE PEEPING TOMS
AND PANTY-SNIFFERS
AND LEATHER ORGIES.
HE COULD BE SCURRILOUS,
\h\h\h\hBUT HE WAS
TOTALLY LOVEABLE.
\h\h\hAlan Finney:
AND JOHN NEVER TOOK
\hHIMSELF SERIOUSLY
AS EITHER AN EVANGELIST
IN TERMS OF SEXUAL MORES
\h\h\h\h\h\hAND FREEDOMS,
\hOR AS A RESPECTABLE,
RESPONSIBLE DRAMATIST.
I‘M TOLD I TREAT WOMEN
\h\hLIKE A SEX OBJECT,
AND I SUPPOSE IT‘S TRUE ‘CAUSE
I ASK FOR SEX AND THEY OBJECT.
BY THE MIDDLE ‘70s, BONKING
\h\hHAD TURNED INTO BANKING.
THERE‘S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
\h\h\h\h\hRichard Brennan:
THERE BECAME AN INCREASING
\h\h\h\h\h\hNUMBER OF FILMS
WHERE PEOPLE HAD MADE
\h\h\hINCREASED SALES
BECAUSE THE FILM FEATURED
\h\hA NUDE APPEARANCE FROM
\h\h\hSOMEBODY ATTRACTIVE.
\h\h\h\h\h\hAlan Hopgood:
ABIGAIL MADE HER NOTORIETY
\h\h\h\h\h\hIN "NUMBER 96."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPhillip Adams:
\h\h\h\h\hAND SHE HAD A SORT OF
A RISQUE REPUTATION ABOUT HER.
\h\hAlan Hopgood:
SHE WAS DEFINITELY
\h\h\hA SEX SYMBOL.
\hWE ADVERTISED THE FACT
\hTHAT WE DID THE FIRST
FULL-FRONTAL WITH ABBY.
OOOH!
\h\hSHE FELT SHE WAS
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.
\h\hRichard Franklin:
SHE HAD THE PRESS SAY,
\h\h"HE USED MY BODY."
AND I WAS RATHER SHOCKED
\h\h\h\h\hAND RANG HER UP
AND SAID, "I DIDN‘T KNOW
\h\h\hYOU FELT THAT WAY."
SHE SAID, "I DIDN‘T.
I WAS JUST GETTING YOU
\h\h\hSOME PUBLICITY."
\h\h\h\hCandy Raymond:
THE MEDIA TOOK THIS ON
\h\h\h\hAS TITILLATION.
\h\h\h\h\h\hIT RAN WITH
"WOMEN AS SEX SYMBOLS."
( rock song playing )
\h\hIT WAS, YOU KNOW, KIND OF
THE THING TO BE AT THAT TIME.
IT HAD A LOT TO DO
\h\hWITH BIKINIS,
WET CLOTHING, RUNNING AROUND
\hHALF-DRESSED AND IN SHOWERS
\h\h\h\hAND THINGS LIKE THAT.
I WAS EMPLOYED PARTLY
\hBECAUSE I WAS PRETTY
\h\h\hAND I WAS WILLING
TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF.
I THINK IT‘S GREAT
\h\hTO ACTUALLY DOCUMENT THAT
YOU LOOKED PRETTY DAMN GOOD.
\h\h\h\hI THOUGHT THAT WE WERE
DEMYSTIFYING THE FEMALE BODY.
\h\hI WAS REALLY
SORELY MISTAKEN.
\hIT WAS SOMETHING
OF AN EXPLOITATION.
\h\h\h\h\hONE OF THE REVIEWS
I READ SAID MY TITS WEREN‘T
\h\h\h\hIN VERY GREAT SHAPE.
SO YES, MY BREASTS WERE REVIEWED
AS OPPOSED TO MY PERFORMANCE.
\h\hCONSEQUENTLY SOME OF
THE BETTER ACTORS TENDED
\h\hNOT TO BE IN FILMS,
\h\hAND YOU HAD MORE AND MORE
MODELS TAKING LEADS IN FILMS.
MY NAME IS TONY GINNANE.
LAST YEAR I BROUGHT A MOVIE
\h\h\hCOMPANY TO HOLLYWOOD,
THE FILM CAPITAL OF
\h\h\h\h\hTHE WORLD,
AND BROUGHT YOU
\h\h"FANTASM."
\hIT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
GET A CAST THAT WOULD
\h\hPARTICIPATE IN IT.
\h\h\hAND THE IDEA CAME UP TO
SHOOT IT IN THE UNITED STATES.
\h\h\h\h\h\hI WAS IN CHARGE OF
\hTHE BIGGEST NUDE THEATRICAL
MODELING AGENCY IN THE WORLD.
\h\h\h\h\hAND INTO MY OFFICE
ONE DAY COME THESE GENTLEMEN
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hFROM AUSTRALIA.
AND OF COURSE THE VERY FIRST
\h\h\h\h\h\hNAME I MENTIONED
WAS JOHN HOLMES,
\h\h\h\hTHE KING.
JOHN WAS LIVING PROOF THAT ALL
\h\hMEN WERE NOT CREATED EQUAL.
THAT‘S A SHOT THAT TENDS
\h\h\h\hTO MAKE YOU GASP.
\h\h\h\h\hTony Ginnane:
\hYOU KNOW, EVERYBODY HAS
THEIR 10 MINUTES OF FAME.
MAYBE JOHN HOLMES HELPED ME
\h\h\hGET 12 INCHES OF FAME.
I‘VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.
I‘D CERTAINLY GO AGAIN.
I THOUGHT IT WAS
REALLY AMUSING.
\h\h\h\hGREAT FUN.
GREAT FUN INDEED.
THERE WAS A BRIEF MOMENT
\hIN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY
WHERE MIDDLECLASS
\h\hMIXED COUPLES
WANTED TO SEE NUDITY AND SEX
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hON THE SCREEN.
NOW WE‘RE BACK
\hIN HOLLYWOOD
\h\h\h\hTO BRING YOU THE MOST
OUTRAGEOUS EROTIC COMEDY EVENT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU‘LL EVER SEE.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, BY THE TIME
\hWE GOT "FANTASM COMES AGAIN"
INTO RELEASE, I THINK THAT
\h\hTHAT MOMENT HAD PASSED.
\h\hTHE SO-CALLED CRITICS
IN THAT PERIOD JUST HATED
\hTHIS KIND OF FILMMAKING.
I‘D FEEL MORE SECURE IF
I ASKED THE PILOT
HOW MANY HOURS
HE‘S PUT IN.
YOU MUST COME UP
AND LOOK AT MY LOG.
IT WAS REALLY A SENSE
\hOF SHOCK AND HORROR
THAT WE WERE GOING TO ADMIT
\h\h\h\h\hTO THE WIDER WORLD
THAT WE WERE... YAHOOS.

\h\h\h\hGraeme Blundell:
YOU HAD THE FEELING THAT
\h\h\hGOVERNMENT AGENCIES
\h\hWOULD ACTUALLY STAND
AT THE BORDER WITH POLICE
\h\h\h\h\h\hAND SECURITY
TO STOP THESE CANS OF FILM
\h\h\hBEING SEEN OVERSEAS.
\h\h\h\h\h\hJack Thompson:
SO INSTEAD OF MAKING FILMS
THAT JUST CAME LIBIDINOUSLY
OUT OF WHO WE WERE,
WE STARTED TO MAKE FILMS
\h\hABOUT WHO WE THOUGHT
\hWE WANTED THEM
TO THINK WE ARE.
\h\h\hBarry Humphries:
SUDDENLY AUSTRALIA HAD
\h\h\hTO HAVE AN IMAGE.
\h\hAND THERE WERE THOSE
ENEMIES OF OUR IMAGE...
SHE‘S SCREAMING
FOR IT, CURL.
HER OLDIES WANT TO
GET ME TO THE CHURCH
BEFORE I SPEAR
THE BEARDED CLAM.
\hPARTICULARLY THOSE WHO
DID NOT DEPICT AUSTRALIA
\h\h\hAS NICE GIRLS IN WHITE
DRESSES VANISHING INTO ROCKS.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPhillip Adams:
BUT PETER WEIR AND THESE OTHER
\h\h\h\hMORE CULTURED DIRECTORS
\h\hHAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT WITHOUT BAZZA AND
\h\h\h\hWITHOUT ALVIN,
WITHOUT THESE VULGAR FILMS,
\h\hWE WOULDN‘T REALLY HAVE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAN INDUSTRY.
\hIT IS VERY CLEAR NOW WHAT
AUSTRALIAN CINEMA WAS DOING.
IT WAS BASICALLY CREATING
\hA HYBRID BETWEEN EUROPE
\h\h\h\h\hAND HOLLYWOOD.
\hAND VIRTUALLY ALL
THE AUSTRALIAN FILMS
\hTHAT WERE BEING FUNDED WERE
CATCHING UP WITH OUR HISTORY.
\h\hSO THAT WAS ONE MOVEMENT
THAT WAS TENDING TO HAPPEN.
\hTHERE WAS ANOTHER MOVEMENT
WHICH WAS GENRE FILMMAKING.

TERRY BOURKE-- PRODUCER,

EGOTISTICAL BASTARD.
\hHIS ATTITUDE WAS VERY MUCH TO
APPEAL TO EVERY KIND OF AUDIENCE
YOU COULD POSSIBLY REEL IN.
\hSO IF YOU HAVE A MURDER,
IT‘S 10 BUCKETS OF BLOOD.
( screams )
"NIGHT OF FEAR" CERTAINLY
\h\h\h\hWAS A TRAILBLAZER.
AN EXERCISE IN SLOW DESCENT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hINTO MADNESS.
IF WE LOOK AT CONTENTIOUS
\h\h\hSCENES IN THAT FILM,
THE ONE THAT CAUSED ENORMOUS
\h\h\hCONFLICT WAS THE SCENE
\hIN WHICH WE HAD
THE SEVERED HEAD.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
I‘VE GOT THIS DECAPITATED HEAD
\h\hIN FRONT OF MY NAKED BODY.
\h\h\hJUST STANDING,
LOOKING DOWN AT HER.
I DIDN‘T WANT TO SEE IT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN THERE
\hBUT WE WERE MAKING HORROR,
WE WERE TOUCHING NEW GROUND.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNorman Yemm:
HE GETS THIS LEVER, PULLS IT
AND 400 RATS COME INSIDE
\h\h\h\h\h\hAND EAT HER.
AND I‘M SITTING OUTSIDE
\h\h\h\hGOING, "OH OH."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTERRY KEPT SAYING,
\h\h"OH, DON‘T WORRY, YOU KNOW,
THE RATS ARE BEHIND THE GLASS."
JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO START,
\h\hHE SAID, "OH, BY THE WAY,
WE‘RE HAVING A BIT OF A PROBLEM
WITH THE GLASS CASE, YOU KNOW.
AND IT REALLY WOULD BE
SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
\h\h\h\h\hIF WE COULD
DO IT REALISTICALLY.
AND WOULD YOU MIND IF THE RATS
\h\h\h\hJUST REACH YOUR HAIR?"
- CARIN SCREAMED.
- ( screams )
IT WAS A SCREAM THAT WAS
\h\h\hA GENUINE SCREAM.
\h\h\h\h\hNorman Yemm:
LIVE RATS ARE CRAWLING
\h\hRIGHT OVER THE BODY
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGOING...
( makes chewing sounds )
WHERE HE COULD PUT SOMETHING
\h\h\h\h\h\hELSE INTO A FILM
THAT MIGHT BE CONTENTIOUS,
\h\h\hHE WOULD MAKE SURE IT
\h\h\h\h\hWOULD GO IN THERE.
Man: "THE LADY STAYED DEAD"
\hWAS JUST A HORROR FILM THAT
\h\h\h\h\hHE WANTED TO MAKE.
THE VILLAIN OF THE PIECE
PICKED THE LEAD LADY UP,
STUCK HER HEAD IN
\hTHE FISH POND.
\hTERRY TOLD HER, IF SHE RAN
OUT OF AIR TO KICK HER LEGS.
WELL, THAT GIRL WAS KICKING
\h\h\h\h\hTHE LEGS LIKE FURY
\h\hAND CHAD HAYWOOD
KEPT HER UPSIDE DOWN.
\hAND HAVING THE LEAD IN
THE FILM, CHAD WAS LIKE,
"OH MAN, I‘VE GOT TO KEEP
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHIS GOING,"
SO HE DIDN‘T TAKE ANY NOTICE
\hOF THE GIRL‘S LEGS KICKING.
AND TERRY DIDN‘T CALL CUT AND
THE GIRL HAD NEARLY DROWNED.
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHEY GOT HER
OUT OF THERE EVENTUALLY.
BUT THAT‘S THE SORT OF GUY
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHE WAS--
DETERMINED TO GET WHAT HE WANTED
IN REAL LIFE AND ONSCREEN.
( all screaming )
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRoger Ward:
IN "BROTHERS," TERRY HAD NUNS
COMING OUT OF THE BUS
\h\h\h\h\hSET ALIGHT.
\h\h\h\hONE WAS GRANT PAGE--
UGLIEST NUN I‘VE EVER SEEN.
\h\hHE WAS THAT SORT OF GUY
THAT WANTED TO BE THE BEST
AND DIDN‘T QUITE MAKE IT,
\h\h\h\h\hUNFORTUNATELY,
BUT HE CERTAINLY TRIED HARD.
IN THAT THRILLER GENRE,
THE FILMS WERE MORE
\h\h\hINTERNATIONAL
\h\hAND MADE FOR A MORE
INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Ladies and gentlemen, may we
\h\hintroduce you to Patrick?
- Man:
\h\hPATRICK WINDS UP IN A COMA. CE
- HE CAN‘T HEAR YOU. HE‘S DEAD.
\h\hTHE YOUNG NURSE BEGINS TO
SUSPECT THAT HE‘S CONSCIOUS.
YOU CAN FEEL THAT,
CAN‘T YOU?
THAT HE‘S NOT ONLY CONSCIOUS
\hBUT THROUGH PSYCHOKINESIS
\h\h\hHE‘S ACTUALLY KE IT,
CONTROLLING PEOPLE...
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
\h\h\hWHAT DO YOU WANT?
...AND STARTS TO GET
\h\h\h\hQUITE NASTY.
\h\h\h\h\hRichard Franklin:
A SCRIPT WAS PRESENTED TO ME
\h\h\hIN ITS FINISHED FORM AND
I WAS REALLY KNOCKED OUT BY IT
\h\h\h\h\hAND THEN I FIXED IT.
THE FIRST THING I KNEW
\h\h\h\hABOUT RICHARD
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWAS WHAT
A HITCHCOCK FAN HE WAS.
\h\h\h\h\h\hRod Mullinar:
HE WOULD STUDY HITCHCOCK‘S
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPICTURES
FRAME BY FRAME
\h\h\hBY FRAME.
\h\h\hAND HE VERY MUCH DESIGNED
PATRICK ALONG THOSE SAME LINES.
WE RIPPED OFF "PSYCHO"
AND HAD HIM MURDER HIS MOTHER
\h\h\h\h\hAND HER BOYFRIEND.
PATRICK?
( both screaming )
JESUS, PATRICK,
YOUR MOTHER!
\h\hI HAD TO ACT
WITH A CHARACTER
\h\h\h\hWHO DIDN‘T HAVE
ANY REACTION WHATSOEVER
\h\h\h\h\hEXCEPT SPIT.
PATRICK DOES LIKE TURN UP
\h\h\h\h\h\hIN "KILL BILL"
WHEN THE BRIDE IS IN A COMA--
\h\h\h\h\hAND HER SPIT THING.
I‘LL ALWAYS REMEMBER
\h\h\h\h\hTHAT ACTOR.
I THOUGHT HE WAS AMAZING
\h\hLOOKING IN THE MOVIE
WITH HIS EYES JUST WIDE OPEN
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAND EVERYTHING.
\h\hIN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT
I HAD IT WRITTEN LIKE THAT.
AND THEN I SHOWED IT TO UMA,
\h\h\hAND SHE SAID, "I‘M NOT
\h\h\h\h\hGOING TO DO THAT."
AND I GO, "WHY?"
\h\h\h\h\h\hAND SHE GOES,
\h\h\h\h"YOU WOULDN‘T HAVE
YOUR EYES OPENED LIKE THAT
\hIF YOU WERE IN COMA.
THAT‘S NOT REALISTIC."
\h\h\hI GO, "ACTUALLY,
I NEVER THOUGHT WAS IT
\h\hREALISTIC OR NOT.
\h\h\h\hIT‘S JUST, PATRICK
DID IT, ALL RIGHT?  AND IT
\h\h\hLOOKED REALLY COOL."
I‘M GOING TO TRY
SOME E.C.T. ON PATRICK
TO SEE IF I CAN SHOCK
SOME RESPONSE OUT OF HIM.
\hRichard Franklin:
\h\hWHEN WE SHOT THE
SHOCK-THERAPY SCENE,
THE GUY WHO WAS THERE AS OUR
\h\h\h\h\h\hTECHNICAL EXPERT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSAID, "WELL,
WHY DON‘T WE JUST GIVE HIM
\h\hSOME SHOCK TREATMENT?"
\h\h\h\hAND ROBERT SAID,
"YEAH YEAH, GREAT IDEA."
HE WAS SO KEEN TO GET
\h\h\hTO DO SOMETHING.
I WOULDN‘T LET THEM DO IT,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOF COURSE.
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE
\hBEEN EFFECTIVE.
Susan Penhaligon:
I THINK THERE WERE
\h\h\hSOME MOMENTS
WHICH PERHAPS WENT
\h\hA BIT TOO FAR.
I THINK WHEN ROBERT HELPMANN
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hATE THE FROGS,
- WE WERE INTO
\h\hANOTHER GENRE THERE. IM
- HE MADE ME.
EVERY MOVIE, TO BE
\h\hA BIG SUCCESS,
\h\h\h\hNEEDS TO HAVE
AT LEAST ONE MOMENT...
COME ON, LOVELY.
I‘LL TAKE YOU HOME.
...THAT EVERYBODY
\h\hTALKS ABOUT.
- AHHH!
- AHHH!
PATRICK LEAPING FROM THE BED
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWAS CERTAINLY
THE MAJOR REASON
FOR ITS SUCCESS.
\h\h\hTony Ginnane:
IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL
THAT A ROGUE ITALIAN PRODUCER
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRIPPED US OFF
AND MADE AN UNAUTHORIZED SEQUEL
CALLED "PATRICK VIVE ANCORA."
\h\h\hQuentin Tarantino:
I DIG ON THE FACT THAT AT
\h\h\hONE MOMENT IN TIME,
AUSTRALIAN FILMS WERE
\h\h\h\h\hSO BANG-ON
THAT THE ITALIANS, YOU KNOW,
\h\h\hDID RIP-OFFS OF THEM.
\h\h\h\h\h\hUNAUTHORIZED OR NOT,
"PATRICK VIVE ANCORA"‘S EARNINGS
ARE AN EXAMPLE OF A SEQUEL
\hSPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL.
AHHH!
\h\hEverett De Roche:
IT‘S GOT NOTHING TO DO
\h\h\h\hWITH "PATRICK"
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hEXCEPT EVERY NOW
\h\h\hAND THEN THEY SUPERIMPOSE
THE ACTOR‘S HEAD ON THE SCREEN.
I SUPPOSE IT‘D HAVE TO BE
\h\h\h\hFLATTERING, YES.
BUT I WISH THEY‘D COME UP
\h\hWITH A BETTER SEQUEL.
\h\h\h\hALMOST EVERYTHING THAT
EVERETT DE ROCHE WROTE IS ONE
\h\h\h\hOF MY FAVORITE FILMS.
THE FILM THAT HE DID
\h\h\h\hTHAT WOULD BE
IN MY TOP-FIVE FAVORITE
\hAUSTRALIAN MOVIES IS
\h\h\h\h"LONG WEEKEND."
\h\hTHE STORYLINE IS ABOUT
THIS COUPLE THAT FIGHT AND
\h\h\hBITCH ALL THE TIME.
AND THEY‘RE GOING OUT FOR
\h\hA WEEKEND IN THE WOODS
TO TRY AND LIKE ALMOST
\hSAVE THEIR MARRIAGE.
ALL RIGHT, YOU‘RE NOT WILD
ABOUT CAMPING.
WE‘RE NOT EXACTLY
ROUGHING IT EITHER.
$2,000 WORTH OF CAMPING GEAR,
I SHOULD HOPE NOT.
FOR THAT WE COULD HAVE A V.I.P.
SUITE AT THE SOUTHERN CROSS.
YEAH, YOU‘D BE
AN AUTHORITY ON HOTEL ROOMS.
GET FUCKED.
\hNOT ONLY ARE THEY AT
EACH OTHERS‘ THROATS,
\h\hBUT THEY PROCEED TO
TRASH THE ENVIRONMENT.
AND THINGS GO VERY
\h\h\hVERY WRONG.
( woman screaming )
\h\h\hQuentin Tarantino:
THE GENRE IN HORROR FILMS
- THAT IT WOULD SEEM
\h\hTO TAKE PLACE IN... I.P.
- PETER!
...IS A MOTHER-NATURE-GOES-
\h\h\hAPESHIT KIND OF MOVIE.
\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Every living creature,
\hevery blade of grass
- will turn against you. -
- ( squawking )
\h\hEverett De Roche:
I JUST LIKE THE IDEA OF
\hNATURE FIGHTING BACK;
\h\h\hTHAT IF PEOPLE
BECOME TOO INTRUSIVE,
\h\h\hLIKE A CANCER
ON THE ENVIRONMENT,
\h\hNATURE HAS ITS
OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM.
Quentin Tarantino:
YOU START BEING ON
THE ANIMALS‘ SIDE,
BECAUSE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE
\hAND SCARY AND DEADLY THING
IN THIS FOREST
ARE THESE TWO.
YOU WANT THIS COUPLE
\h\h\hTO GET KILLED.
BUT THEN AGAIN THERE‘S ANOTHER
\hWEIRD ASPECT ABOUT THE FILM.
AS YOU WATCH THE MOVIE,
THINGS ARE NOT EXACTLY
\hWHAT THEY SEEM TO BE.
THEY NEVER EVER MAKE IT CLEAR,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOR SAY OUT LOUD,
IF ANYTHING WAS WRONG
\h\h\hIN THE FOREST.
THAT‘S REALLY TERRIFIC
AND THAT‘S REALLY HARD
\h\h\h\h\hTO PULL OFF.
- WHAT‘S THAT?
- WHERE?
- THERE, IN YOUR HAIR.
- ( both scream )
WHEN IT HIT THE SCREENS,
IT JUST DIDN‘T RESONATE
\hWITH AN AUDIENCE HERE.
MAYBE AUSTRALIANS DIDN‘T
\hWANT TO SEE THEMSELVES
\hPORTRAYED LIKE THAT--
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAS AN UGLY COUPLE
THAT‘S GREEDY AND DESTRUCTIVE.
LOTS OF ELEMENTS OF NATURE
\h\h\h\h\h\hFIGHTING BACK
\h\h\h\hSEEMED A LITTLE
\h\hBIT PREPOSTEROUS TO
AN AUSTRALIAN AUDIENCE.
THE LANDSCAPE‘S VERY FAMILIAR.
\h\h\hIT DOESN‘T LOOK MENACING.
TO AN OVERSEAS AUDIENCE,
\h\hIT WAS REALLY EXOTIC.
♪ IF YOU GO DOWN IN
THE WOODS TODAY YOU MIGHT
GET A BIG SURPRISE. ♪
IT‘S A TRUE LITTLE
\hUNDISCOVERED GEM
THAT IS JUST BEGGING
\hTO BE REDISCOVERED
\h\h\hAND ACTUALLY HAVE IT TAKE
ITS PLACE IN ‘70s GENRE CINEMA.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\h\h\h\h"Long Weekend."
An experience in terror.
\h\h\hYOU KNOW, THE NAME
THAT JUST SHOWS UP MORE
\h\h\hTHAN ANYBODY ELSE
IS ANTHONY I. GINNANE.
\h\h\h\hHE WAS THE PRODUCER OF
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE GENRE FILM
THAT CAME OUT OF AUSTRALIA
\h\h\h\h\hAND THAT I SAW.
\h\h\hHE WAS SERIOUSLY
MISJUDGED AT THE TIME.
\h\hTONY GINNANE AND HIS WORK
SHOULD BE BURNED TO THE GROUND
AND THE ASHES SEWN
\h\h\h\hWITH SALT.
I WANTED TO BLOW THINGS UP...
\h\hHAVE PEOPLE BEING CHASED
AROUND WITH KNIVES AND GUNS.
I DON‘T KNOW THAT
\hHE‘S RESPONSIBLE
FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF
REALLY GOOD CINEMA.
\h\h\hTony Ginnane:
I DIDN‘T WANT TO PUT
\hAUDIENCES TO SLEEP.
- I WANTED TO WAKE THEM UP.
- ( screaming )
\h\h\h\hHE WAS ACTUALLY
GENUINELY INTERESTED IN
THE CREATIVE SIDE OF IT,
\hBUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
JUDGED HIM NOT TO BE.
TONY WAS A BIT OILY,
\h\h\hFULL OF CRAP.
\h\h\h\h\hRichard Brennan:
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
WHO USES EXPRESSIONS LIKE,
"I‘M GETTING REALLY HORNY
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LARGE
\h\h\h\h\hSUMS OF MONEY."
AUSTRALIA‘S ROGER CORMAN.
PROBABLY AN ACCURATE WAY TO
\h\hDESCRIBE ME, TRUTHFULLY.
IF I SEE HIS NAME AS
\h\h\h\h\hA PRODUCER
OF A FILM I HAVEN‘T SEEN BEFORE,
I‘LL GIVE IT A SHOT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator
From the decadent nightlife
\h\hand the jetset discos,
Angela is playing a deadly
\h\hgame of hide and seek.
( screaming )
\hI THINK EVERETT MUST HAVE BEEN
DRINKING SOME VERY STRANGE WINE
\h\hOR TAKING SOME VERY STRANGE
DRUGS WHEN HE WROTE THAT SCRIPT.
CAN YOU THINK OF A MORE ABSURD
PREMISE THAN THE MR. WHIPPY VAN
BEING THE INSTRUMENT OF EVIL?
"SNAPSHOT" IS PRETTY LIGHT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hON SUBTEXT.
\h\h\h\h\h\hSigrid Thornton:
I THINK PEOPLE FEEL AS THOUGH
BECAUSE I HAD TO TAKE
\h\h\h\h\hMY TOP OFF,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT IT MUST HAVE
\h\hBEEN SOMETHING THAT I MUST
HAVE FELT A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT.
BUT FOR ME IT WAS JUST
A TERRIFIC ADVENTURE.
THE STORY REQUIRED IT BECAUSE
\h\h\hOF THIS MAN‘S OBSESSION.
AND SHE WALKS INTO THIS ROOM
\h\hAND SEES THIS CENTERFOLD
PLASTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM.
IT WAS KIND OF CREEPY WALKING IN
AND FINDING THIS IMAGE
OF HERSELF AND THEN THE WHOLE
\h\h\hTHING CATCHING ON FIRE.
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHE STUNT GUYS WERE
EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WATER GEL
\hWHICH MEANS YOU COULD
SET FIRE TO YOURSELF AND
JUST RUN AROUND ON FIRE
WITH THE LEADING ACTRESS.
( both screaming )
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSimon Wincer:
WHEN IT‘S ACTUALLY HAPPENING,
IT‘S MUCH MORE REAL
\h\hTHAN YOU THINK.
AND SO HER REACTIONS
\h\h\hARE VERY REAL.
GO ON!
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHEY RETITLED
\h\h\hTHE FILM IN AMERICA,
"THE DAY AFTER HALLOWEEN."
AND THAT WAS GINNANE
AND HIS OVERSEAS LOT
TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON
\hJOHN CARPENTER‘S FILM.
ANYTHING WITH THE NAME
\h\h"HALLOWEEN" IN IT
\h\h\hAND LIKE, COULD BE
A SEQUEL TO "HALLOWEEN,"
\h\hYOU WENT AND SAW IT.
LIKE, "WHAT‘S THIS SHIT?"
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
\hWITH THAT AT ALL.
\h\h\h\hHALLOWEEN‘S
NOT EVEN MENTIONED.
Quentin Tarantino:
IT WAS EXPLOITATION
\h\h\hAT ITS BEST,
BECAUSE PART OF THE THING
\hABOUT GOING TO SEE EVERY
\h\h\h\hEXPLOITATION MOVIE
THAT CAME OUT IS YOU HAD TO BE
\hJUST COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF,
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST FIVE
\hTIMES DURING THE YEAR.
"DAY AFTER HALLOWEEN" WAS
\h\hONE OF THOSE RIP-OFFS.
\h\h\h\h\h\hTONY STUMBLED ONTO
A FORMULA WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY
\h\h\hVERY SUCCESSFUL FOR HIM.
\h\hTHRILLER, HORROR,
\hWITH A PSYCHOLOGICAL
OR SUPERNATURAL TWIST.
Narrator:
Vampires--
driven by insatiable thirst.
GINNANE‘S FIRST COMMENT WAS,
\h\h\h\h"I WANT YOU TO KNOW
RIGHT UP FRONT, THIS IS BEING
\hMADE FOR THE DRIVE-IN SET."
\h\h\h\hSO WE TRIED TO FIND
A SEQUENCE THAT WOULD REALLY
\hKEEP THE AUDIENCE ON EDGE.
THE THIRST IS IN ALL OF US.
NOT IN ME!
\h\h\h\hTony Ginnane:
IN "THIRST," WE BROUGHT
\h\hIN DAVID HEMMINGS;
\h\h\hWE BROUGHT
IN HENRY SILVER,
\h\h\h\hWHO COULD
NOT READ HIS LINES
WITHOUT WEARING GLASSES,
\hWHICH MADE HIM THE ONLY
\hGLASSES-WEARING VAMPIRE
IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA.
THERE IS A SHOT IN "THIRST"
\h\h\h\hWHERE DAVID HEMMINGS
\hIS IN A HELICOPTER AND
HENRY SILVER GOES UP AND
\h\hLETS GO OF THE SKIDS.
AND HE DIDN‘T WANT TO GO
\h\hNEAR A HELICOPTER--
\h\h\h\h"I‘M NOT GOING
NEAR THAT DAMN THING."
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE GOT
THE SKIDS OF A HELICOPTER
AND BOLTED THEM TO
\hA CHERRY PICKER,
\h\h\hAND SAID, "LOOK, HENRY,
WE‘RE JUST GOING TO LIFT YOU
\hA FEW FEET OFF THE GROUND."
IT DID GO A LITTLE HIGHER
\h\h\h\hTHAN HE EXPECTED.
\hVincent Monton: FT YOU
WE TOOK HIM UP 70‘,
\h\h\h\hAND HE WAS SCREAMING
AND YELLING AND CARRYING ON.
I‘M SURE HIS PANTS WERE WET
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAT ABOUT 50‘.
AHHHH!
\h\h\h\hTONY MADE FILMS
WITH A VERY CLEAR EFFORT
THAT HE WANTED THOSE FILMS
\h\h\hTO BE SOLD OVERSEAS.
\h\hTHAT DIDN‘T WIN ME
A WHOLE LOT OF FRIENDS
\h\hEXCEPT THE PEOPLE
WHO BANKED MY CHECKS.
MOST OF THESE FILMS
\h\h\hWERE RUBBISH.
\h\hI OPPOSED THEM
VERY STRENUOUSLY.
\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Is he the new messiah
or a demon from
another world?
"HARLEQUIN" HAD ITS
\hSMATTERING OF SEX
AND IT HAD BRODERICK CRAWFORD
\h\h\hAND DAVID HEMMINGS AND
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hROBERT POWELL.
IT IS A SORT OF MODERN
POLITICAL STORY, I SUPPOSE,
BASED ON THE UPDATING
OF THE RASPUTIN THEME.
AND THAT IS REALLY ALL.
IT EXCITED ME
ENOUGH TO SAY YES...
AND COME 12,000 MILES
TO SHOOT IT.
FLIMFLAM...
AND HOCUS-POCUS.
( all screaming )
\h\h\hWE WERE TRYING
TO PRESENT THE FILM
AS NOT BEING SET
\h\hIN AUSTRALIA.
\h\h\hIT WAS SET
IN NOWHERE LAND.
I THINK ATTEMPTS TO CURRY
\h\hTO THE AMERICAN MARKET
\h\h\h\hWERE OFTEN SILLY.
( American accent )
HELL, I DON‘T KNOW.
THEY JUST SAID PROCESS HIM
AND STICK HIM IN THE SLAMMER.
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
- DAMN FEDS.
- WE DIDN‘T SEE IT THAT WAY
\h\h\h\hAND IT CERTAINLY
WASN‘T SEEN THAT WAY BY
INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES.
THOSE FILMS, IF YOU
\hADDED THEM ALL UP,
PROBABLY MADE QUITE A BIT OF
\h\hMONEY FOR TONY GINNANE.
\h\h\h\hTHEY DIDN‘T
FOR THE REST OF US.
TONY DID DELIVER.
HE DID RAISE FUNDS
\h\h\hFOR PICTURES
AND HE ENABLED A LOT OF
PEOPLE TO MAKE PICTURES.
\h\h\hNarrator:
\hJames Herbert‘s
frightening novel
of supernatural power
\h\h\his now a movie.
\h\h\h\h\h"THE SURVIVOR" WAS
THE FIRST MOVIE IN AUSTRALIA
\h\h\hTHAT WENT OVER
A $1 MILLION BUDGET.
\h\h\hTHE FILM OPENS
WITH A PLANE CRASH.
IT WAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOF GASOLINE
AND OTHER FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES
\h\h\h\hTHAT HAD EVER BEEN USED
IN AN AUSTRALIAN MOVIE.
\h\hIT WAS PRETTY AMBITIOUS
TO BUILD AND BLOW UP A 747,
AND THEN TO GO INTO THIS LONG,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDEEP THING
\h\hABOUT THE PILOT
BEING RESURRECTED.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\h\h\h\h300 murdered souls
combine their psychic energy
to hunt down their killer.
ONE OF THE MISTAKES
\h\h\hI THINK I MADE
WAS TO THROTTLE BACK ON
\h\hTHE GORE COMPONENT;
MOOD, MYSTERY, AMBIGUITY
RATHER THAN SLASH
AND CUT AND KILL.
\h\h\hNarrator:
Brace yourselves
\h\hfor a journey
to the outer limits
\h\h\hof nightmare.
\h\hTONY HAD THIS THEORY
THAT YOU NEEDED TO SELL
\h\h\h\h\hINTO THE AMERICAN
\h\hAND EUROPEAN MARKETS BY
EMPLOYING AMERICAN ACTORS.
ACTORS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE
\h\h\h\hBE SITTING AROUND IN
\h\h\hTHE OLD ACTORS‘ HOME.
\h\h\h\h"HAVE I GOT
A FILM STAR FOR YOU!
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hREMEMBER HIM?
\h\h\hHE WAS SO GOOD IN THAT
MICKEY ROONEY FILM OF 1935.
\h\h\hYOU REMEMBER HIM?
HERE HE IS. HERE HE IS. IA
\h\h\hHE‘S GOING CHEAP."
IT WAS NOT A CASE OF BRINGING
IN SOME, YOU KNOW, DESPERADO.
\hBRODERICK CRAWFORD--
ACADEMY-AWARD WINNER...
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHE LOOKS AT ME
\hVERY BLEARY-EYED AND SAYS,
"WHY DON‘T YOU GET FUCKED?"
\h...JOSEPH COTTON--
ACADEMY-AWARD WINNER.
\h\h\h\h\h\hAN EXTREMELY
ADEQUATE ACTOR IN 1940.
\h\h\h\hA LOT OF THOSE ACTORS
ACTUALLY I LIKED QUITE A BIT.
\h\h\h\hIT WAS GOOD TO SEE THEM
GETTING THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY
\h\h\hWOULDN‘T GET IN AMERICA.
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT WAS VERY VERY
UNPOPULAR WITH ACTORS‘ EQUITY.
THEY MADE NO SENSE CULTURALLY
\h\h\h\h\hOR PHILOSOPHICALLY,
\hAND FRANKLY DID NOT MAKE
SENSE ECONOMICALLY TO US.
FAIRLY OBVIOUSLY EQUITY
BASED THEIR DECISIONS ON
\h\h\hFANTAIL WRAPPERS.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
The hitchhiker plays games...
\hAREN‘T YOU KIND OF YOUNG
TO BE HITCHHIKING OUT HERE
\h\h\h\h\hALL BY YOURSELF?
AREN‘T YOU KIND OF OLD
\hTO BE PICKING ME UP?
...the truck driver
\h\hplays games...
ONE TORSO IS PRETTY MUCH
\h\h\h\h\hLIKE ANOTHER.
\h\h\hOH, FOUL.
YOU LOSE A TURN.
...and a killer is playing
the deadliest game of all.
\h\h\hEVERETT WENT AWAY WITH
THE SCRIPT OF "REAR WINDOW"
\h\h\h\h\hAND CAME BACK WITH
"REAR WINDOW" SET IN A TRUCK.
I‘D ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBY THE IDEA
THAT WHEN YOU GO ON
\hA LONG ROAD TRIP,
YOU‘LL PASS SOMEBODY AND THEN
\hLATER ON THEY‘LL PASS YOU.
\hAND IT‘S LIKE THIS
TRAVELING COMMUNITY.
THEY MAKE STUPID JOKES...
NOW THERE‘S A MAN
\h\h\hWITH BALLS.
...AND PLAY STUPID GAMES.
\h\h\h\h\hAND TO HAVE THIS
\h\h\h\hLIGHT-HEARTED FEEL
\hAGAINST A BACKDROP
OF EXTREME VIOLENCE.
\h\h\h\h\h\hSO WHAT IF HE IS A
MURDERER AND HE‘S GOING AROUND
SYSTEMATICALLY BUTCHERING
\h\hEVERY FEMALE IN SIGHT,
- MAKING THEM INTO TACOS? EY
- ( gasps )
\hI GOT THIS CALL THAT THEY
WERE GOING TO MAKE THIS FILM
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN AUSTRALIA
WITH A DIRECTOR WHO WAS
\h\hTHE ALFRED HITCHCOCK
\h\h\h\h\hOF AUSTRALIA.
\hJAMIE LEE AT THE TIME WAS
THE GODDESS OF THAT GENRE--
THE QUEEN OF SCREAM.
SOMEBODY ASKED HER
\h\hTHE QUESTION,
"WHAT IS IT LIKE PUTTING
AUSTRALIANS OUT OF WORK?"
\h\h\hI FELT THEN AS NOW
THAT AMERICANS ARE SCUM
\hAND SHOULD NOT BE LET
ANYWHERE NEAR OUR MONEY.
IT‘S A VERY SCARY
\h\h\hTHING TO DO,
TO BE THE SORT OF TOKEN
\hAMERICAN ON SOMETHING
\h\h\h\hTHAT THERE IS
SOME HOSTILITY ABOUT.
\h\hI KNEW THERE WAS HOSTILITY
ABOUT BEING A TOKEN AMERICAN,
\h\h\h\hLET ALONE THAT I HAD
TAKEN ANOTHER PERSON‘S JOB.
THE CONCEPT OF TWO AMERICANS
\h\hMEETING IN THE MIDDLE OF
\h\h\hTHE AUSTRALIAN DESERT
\hIS A BIT OF A COINCIDENCE--
THERE‘S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
BUT IT WORKED.  I THINK THAT‘S
\h\hWHERE THE ATTRACTION COMES.
\hTHAT KIND OF SYNCHRONICITY
AND SERENDIPITY HAPPENS OUT
\hIN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Across 1,600 miles
of desert highway,
\hthey‘re playing games of
violence and sudden death.
WE STARTED SHOOTING THE FILM
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN MELBOURNE
\h\h\hAND SHOT ALL
THE WAY TO PERTH.
\h\h\h\h\hJamie Lee Curtis:
\h\h\hTHE ENTIRE MOVIE MOVED
THROUGH THE NULLARBOR PLAIN.
IT WAS LIKE A JOHN FORD MOVIE,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU KNOW?
\h\h\h\h\h\hBECAUSE WE WERE
THIS GUERRILLA DESERT CREW.
\h\hAFTER FIVE DAYS FILMING,
THEY WERE FOUR DAYS BEHIND.
\h\h\h\h\hRichard Franklin:
\h\h\h\h\hSUDDENLY THEY WERE
GOING THROUGH THE STORYBOARD
\hSAYING, "WE WON‘T SHOOT THIS
AND WE‘LL GIVE YOU FOUR TAKES
\h\h\h\hOF THIS AND NO MORE."
\h\hGIVEN THE BUDGET
AND THE CONSTRAINTS
\hTHAT HE WAS UNDER,
\h\h\h\hI THOUGHT IT
TURNED OUT VERY WELL.
\h\h\h\h\h\hQuentin Tarantino:
THE FIRST MURDER IS ABSOLUTELY
FANTASTIC WITH THE GUITAR WIRE.
THE WAY THAT WHOLE PIECE
WORKS IS JUST MASTERFUL.
\hIN FACT THAT‘S THE SCENE
THAT WHEN YOU‘RE WATCHING
\h\h\h\hTHE MOVIE YOU GO,
\h"OH, WOW, THIS ISN‘T JUST
GOING TO BE A SLASHER MOVIE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOF THE WEEK.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD."
- ( screeching )
- ( honking )
\h\hTHE BOAT STUNT IS PROBABLY
ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN THE FILM.
I LOOKED AT THE CHARIOT RACE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN "BEN HUR"
\h\h\hAND I GOT THE WHEELS OF
THE TRUCK RUBBING ON THE BOAT
\h\hAND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS.
\h\h\hStacey Keach:
AND WHEN YOU‘RE GOING
\hTO DESTROY A BOAT,
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE.
AND IT WENT OFF, THANK GOODNESS,
WITHOUT A HITCH...
COCK.
\h\hTHERE ARE ELEMENTS OF THAT
THAT I‘M SURE WOUND THEMSELVES
\h\h\h\h\hINTO "WOLF CREEK"--
\hTHAT NOTION OF THE ADVENTURE
ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE MEETING
\h\h\h\hOF THIS EVIL CHARACTER.
\h\hI MEAN, IT‘S STILL THERE IN
\h\hTHE FINALE OF "WOLF CREEK,"
THAT INFLUENCE OF "ROAD GAMES."
YOU COULD REMAKE "ROAD GAMES"
\h\h\hTOMORROW AND NOT CHANGE
\h\h\h\h\h\hA DAMN WORD OF IT
\h\h\h\hAND IT WOULD SCARE
THE HELL OUT OF EVERYBODY.
IT‘S AN AMAZING MOVIE.
IT‘S REALLY TERRIFIC.
\h\hNarrator:
"Road Games"--
if someone doesn‘t stop soon,
they‘re won‘t be anyone left
\h\h\h\h\h\h\halive to play.
\hAT THE TIME, THERE WAS
A HUGE SENSITIVITY ABOUT
\h\h\hCULTURAL IDENTITY.
\h\hONE OF THE PROBLEMS
WITH THE FUNDING BODIES
WAS THAT THEY HAD THIS BRIEF
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT THE FILM
MUST SING AN AUSTRALIAN SONG.
\h\hIT MUST SMELL EUCALYPTIC.
THEY‘RE TALKING ABOUT EMUS
AND CLOSEUPS OF GUM TREES
\hAND A COUPLE OF PRETTY SUNSETS
IN THE OUTBACK AND THERE YOU GO.
THAT‘S AUSTRALIAN CULTURE.
YOU CAN MAKE ANY FILM
\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU LIKE.
IT DOESN‘T HAVE TO BE RELEGATED
TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE OUTBACK
\h\h\h\h\h\hTO BE AUSTRALIAN.
CRITICS COULDN‘T GET USED
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO THE FACT
THAT SOME FILMMAKERS
\h\hWERE MAKING FILMS
\h\h\h\h\hTHAT THEY SAW AS
EXCLUSIVELY AMERICAN GENRE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\h\h\h\h\hWatch closely now,
but don‘t dare look behind you.
Just feel the skin crawl
on the back of your neck.
\h\h\h\h\h\hJohn Lamond:
I THOUGHT IF I‘M GOING TO
MAKE A GUTSY HORROR FILM,
THERE‘S NO POINT IN
\h\h\hBEING SUBTLE.
AND I THOUGHT I‘D LIKE TO SLASH
THE BARE BEHIND OF SOME BIRD
WHO‘S BEEN SCREWED
IN THE MAKEUP ROOM.
\h\hWHEN JOHN‘S ON THEME,
HE LIKES TO KEEP IT GOING.
\hTHEY SAID, "WHICH PART
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY?"
( screaming )
AND I SAID, "JUDY, PERHAPS.
\h\hSHE‘S THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN‘T GET KILLED
WHILE SHE‘S SCREWING."
IT‘S NOT SOME OF MY FINEST
\h\h\h\hMOMENTS ON SCREEN
AND IT‘S A FAR CRY
\h\h\hFROM CONTENT
WHICH PHILOSOPHICALLY ADDRESSES
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHE HUMAN CONDITION
AND CONTRIBUTES IN THAT WAY.
\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Many motion pictures
\hpromise you terror,
\h\hbut "Nightmares"
is truly frightening.
\h\h\hTHE BIG DANGER OF BEING
AN AUSTRALIAN GENRE FILMMAKER,
I THINK, IS THAT YOU CAN
\h\h\h\hEASILY FALL INTO
\h\h\h\hAN AMERICAN
DERIVATIVE PATTERN.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
\h\h\hI FELT "THE MARSUPIALS"
WAS USING A HOLLYWOOD GENRE,
AN ESTABLISHED ONE, AND TURNING
IT INTO AN AUSTRALIAN COMEDY.
ARRGH!
G‘DAY.  WANT TO PUT A SHRIMP
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hON THE BARBIE?
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
The howling terror continues
\h\hwith a whole new breed of
werewolves in "Howling III."
\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
IMOGEN AINSLEY PLAYED
\hTHE WEREWOLF GIRL.
THE RUNNER-UP FOR THE ROLE
\h\h\h\hWAS NICOLE KIDMAN,
\h\hBUT SHE JUST WASN‘T
WEREWOLF ENOUGH FOR ME.
THERE WASN‘T THAT WEREWOLF
\h\h\h\h\hTANG WE NEEDED.
THERE‘S A LOT OF RIDICULOUS
\h\h\hTHINGS IN THAT MOVIE.
MY FAVORITE IS THE BALLERINA
\h\hTURNING INTO A WEREWOLF.
( all screaming )
\h\h\hTHERE WAS A SCENE
WHERE SHE‘S LYING IN BED
HAVING THIS DREAM AND SOMETHING
\h\h\hCOMES THROUGH HER POUCH.
THE WEREWOLF HEAD BURSTING OUT
\hWAS A REFERENCE TO "ALIEN."
\h\hMORE AMUSING TO ME
IS THE MARSUPIAL BIRTH.
I STUDIED SOME REALLY BORING
FILM AUSTRALIA DOCUMENTARIES
ON KANGAROOS BEING BORN.
AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE
\h\hOUT HOW TO DO THAT WITH
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBOB McCARRON,
\h\hAND BOB McCARRON SAID,
"WHY DON‘T WE PUT A MOUSE
IN A WEREWOLF FETUS SUIT?"
\h\h\hI SAID, "GOOD IDEA."
SO WE GOT THIS MOUSE AND WE PUT
\hA WEREWOLF FETUS SUIT ON IT.
IMOGEN STARTED SCREAMING AND
\hIT WAS RUNNING ALL AROUND
AND BOB SAID, "WE‘LL HAVE
\h\hTO SEDATE THE MOUSE."
SO WE GOT THE NURSE.
SHE INJECTED THE POOR MOUSE
\h\h\h\hAND IT DROPPED DEAD.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSO WE SAID LOOK,
\h\h\h\h"USE LESS SEDATIVES."
SHE SAID, "I‘M REALLY SORRY."
SO WE HAD TO GET ANOTHER MOUSE,
\h\h\h\h\hUSED A LITTLE BIT OF
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHE SEDATIVE.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE GETTING
THE MOUSE INTO THE POUCH.
SO I PUT THE MOUSE IN THE POUCH,
FILMED IT IN REVERSE,
AND OF COURSE IT CAME OUT.
\h\h\h\h\hSO ALL WAS WELL.
WE ALL KNEW IT WAS RUBBISH.
WE KNEW EVERYTHING
\h\h\hWAS A JOKE.
( screaming )
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
IT GOT A THEATRICAL RELEASE,
\hTO THE PUZZLEMENT OF MANY.
THAT‘S THE UNDERSTATEMENT
\h\h\h\h\h\hOF THE NIGHT.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" SAID,
"IF YOU SEE ONE WEREWOLF MOVIE,
SEE THIS ONE."
I USED TO GET REALLY SICK
AND TIRED OF GETTING THIS
\hSORT OF BACKLASH ABOUT,
\h\hYOU KNOW, "WHY ARE WE MAKING
THIS SORT OF FILM IN AUSTRALIA?
WE HAVEN‘T GOT ENOUGH MONEY
ANYWAY AND WE‘RE ONLY DOING
\hLITTLE "b" B-GRADE FILMS.
\h\hLEAVE ‘EM TO THE AMERICANS,
THEY MAKE THEM BETTER THAN US."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU KNOW,
AND I THINK THAT‘S CRAP.
\hI DON‘T REMEMBER TRYING TO
COMPETE WITH THE AMERICANS.
IT WAS JUST REALLY JUST
\hTO FILM WHAT WAS TRUE.
I WAS REALLY ACTUALLY INTO
RUSSELL MULCAHY ALL RIGHT.
\h\h\h\h\h\hI THOUGHT HE WAS
THE POOR MAN‘S RIDLEY SCOTT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\hFrom Australia‘s hottest
new director Russell Mulcahy,
"Razorback."
ONLY GOT TWO STATES OF BEING:
DANGEROUS OR DEAD.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
BOB McCARRON HAD A VERY
\h\h\hLARGE RAZORBACK.
AND RUSSELL SAID, "SHOULDN‘T IT
BE MUCH BIGGER THAN THIS?"
\h\hLIKE, AT LEAST
2‘ or 3‘ BIGGER?"
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWE WENT,
"YEAH, THAT‘D BE SO COOL."
SO WE DID IT.
\h\h\hAND THINKING ABOUT IT,
WE PROBABLY SHOULDN‘T HAVE.
A $100 MILLION FILM
\h\hWITH A $10 PIG.
( man screaming )
IT LITERALLY ROLLED IN
\hLIKE A WHEELBARROW.
\h\hGREGORY HAD THE TEETH
GNASHING AWAY AT HIS FACE
TRYING TO ACTUALLY BITE
\h\h\h\h\hHIS FACE OFF.
\h\h\hGregory Harrison:
AND THAT SALIVA WAS SOME
\h\hGROTESQUE COMBINATION
\h\hOF-- WELL, WE USED TO
MAKE SPERM JOKES ABOUT IT.
IT WAS JUST REALLY GROSS.
\h\hTHERE WERE MANY POINTS
WHERE I HAD SECOND THOUGHTS
\hABOUT, "WHAT HAVE I DONE?"
I HAD A HUGE SCENE WITH
\h\h\h\hA MECHANICAL PIG
WHERE IT JUST TOOK ME APART.
( screaming )
\h\h\hAFTERWARDS YOU THINK,
"OH, THAT WAS REALLY STUPID.
\h\h\hI COULD HAVE REALLY
HURT MYSELF IN THAT CAR."
YOU JUST DON‘T THINK
THAT A MOVIE ABOUT
A GIANT MONSTER PIG
WOULD HAVE SUCH A GREAT
AESTHETIC VISUAL TO IT,
BUT RUSSELL REALLY
WENT ALL OUT.
I WAS LEAPING OVER CHASMS
\h\h\hOF MISSING DIALOGUE
\h\hOR MISSING SUBTEXT
AND HE WOULD BE SAYING,
"YEAH, BUT THERE‘S SMOKE
\h\hCOMING FROM THE FAN.
\h\hAND I NEED YOU
TO ZIP THROUGH THAT
\hBECAUSE THAT SMOKE STARTS TO
WAFT AWAY IF WE DON‘T HURRY."
HOW DO YOU ACT WITH THAT?
\hYOU CAN‘T ACT
WITH THE SMOKE.
RUSSELL ENCOURAGED ME
\h\h\h\h\h\hTO BELIEVE
THAT THEY‘RE NOT GOING TO BE
\h\hLISTENING TO THE DIALOGUE
\h\h\h\hAS MUCH AS YOU THINK
\h\hBECAUSE THE VISUALS ARE
GOING TO BE SO SPECTACULAR.
THAT‘S A HORRIBLE THING
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO SAY--
\h\h\h\h"DON‘T HIT THE DIALOGUE.
THE VISUALS WILL BLOW AWAY YOU.
\hNOBODY WILL BE
LOOKING AT YOU."
\h\h\hIT WAS CLEARLY
CAPITAL-C COMMERCIAL
\h\h\hAND MANY WOULD ARGUE
HAD LITTLE IF NO ARTISTIC
\h\hOR INTELLECTUAL MERIT.
I THINK WHEN THE DOG
\h\hGOT RUN OVER...
♪ EASE ON DOWN,
EASE ON DOWN THE ROAD. ♪
\h\h\h...I NOTICED A NUMBER OF
EXECUTIVES WHO LEFT THE CINEMA.
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?
- I DON‘T KNOW.
\h\hSO KILLING DOGS
IS NOT A GOOD THING
TO DO IN MOVIES,
\h\h\hI LEARNED.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHal McElroy:
WE HAD TO WORK ON A CAPITAL-C
\h\h\h\hCOMMERCIAL CRITERIA,
AND IN THAT REGARD, THERE WERE
\h\hBIGGER AND BETTER AMERICAN
\h\h\h\h\hFILMS THAN THIS ONE.
\h\h\h\h\hGregory Harrison:
I THINK "RAZORBACK"‘S PROBLEM
\h\hWAS STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE.
- BUT THERE IS
\hA LOT OF STYLE.
- ( cawing )
IT‘S NOT THAT I TRIED TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE A LONG VIDEO,
IT‘S JUST THAT WAS MY STYLE.
\h\h\h\hAND THAT WAS SEEN
AS A MINUS AT THAT POINT,
WHEREAS NOW IT‘S SEEN
AS AN ABSOLUTE PLUS.
( screaming )
MAYBE THAT‘S WHY IT HAS STOOD
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHE TEST OF TIME
\hBECAUSE IT‘S GRADUALLY GROWN
IN TO THE STYLE OF FILMMAKING
THAT IS MUCH MORE MODERN NOW.
THERE‘S AN ANIMAL OUT THERE
\h\h\h\hAND IT‘S HUNTING US.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
HALFWAY THROUGH WRITING
THE SCRIPT FOR "ROGUE,"
I FOUND OUT THERE WAS ALREADY
\h\h\hAN AUSTRALIAN CROC MOVIE
\h\h\h\h\h\hCALLED "DARK AGE."
( screaming )
\h\h\h\hQuentin Tarantino:
I ACTUALLY THINK YOU COULD
\h\h\h\hRELEASE "DARK AGE"
IN THE THEATER TOMORROW
\h\h\h\hIN 2,000 SCREENS
AND PEOPLE WOULD GO
\h\h\h\h\h\hSEE IT.
THE ONLY NEGATIVE IN IT IS THAT
THE CROC ISN‘T THAT GOOD.
I HAD TO ROPE THE HEAD AND
\h\hIT CAME UP AND WENT...
"BRRRR... ARRR."
SO I‘M TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK
\h\h\h\h\h\hFRANTIC, YOU KNOW?
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTony Ginnane:
THE CROCODILE WAS SUPPOSED TO
\hMOVE AT A REASONABLE CLIP.
WELL, I SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT
HAVE DEPENDED A LITTLE BIT
\h\hUPON WHAT YOUR DEFINITION
OF WHAT A REASONABLE CLIP WAS.
\hJohn Jarratt:
I MANAGED TO GET
THE LEGS TO WORK,
AND WE WERE RUNNING ALONG
\hLIKE IT WAS A LABRADOR
\h\h\h\h\hDOG BESIDE IT.
AND HIS LITTLE OLD LEGS
\h\h\h\hWERE DOING THIS.
\h\hAND WE WERE GOING,
"COME ON, NUMMINWARRY."
COME ON.
\h\h\h\h"HERE, BOY,
INTO THE BILLABONG."
I PUT IT IN THE WATER
\h\h\h\hAND IT FUSED.
( electricity buzzes )
\h\hTHERE WAS A SPATE OF
CROCODILES EATING PEOPLE
AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE
\h\h\h\hA WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY
TO SEE IF I COULD BUY
\h"DARK AGE" BACK...
( crying )
...BUT I COULDN‘T CONVINCE
\h\h\h\h\hHOYTS OR VILLAGE.
AND SO IT‘S ONE OF THOSE
FORGOTTEN MASTERPIECES.
THESE FILMS ARE NOW
SORT OF RELEGATED
TO THE DUSTY BACK SHELVES
OF VIDEO STORES, IF THAT.
\h\h\h\h\h\hTarantino:
\h\hTHERE‘S A WONDERFUL
AUSTRALIAN HORROR FILM
- CALLED "NEXT OF KIN."
- I WAS INTERESTED IN
\hLESS OF THE GORE,
\h\h\hBLOOD AND ALL OF WHAT
YOU DIDN‘T KNOW WAS GOING ON
AND MORE INTO FEAR,
\h\h\h\h\hI GUESS.
( screaming )
\hTHE FILM THAT IT REMINDS YOU
OF THE MOST IS "THE SHINING."
\h\h\h\h"NEXT OF KIN" HAS
A SIMILAR TONE AND FEEL,
WHICH IS ONE HELL OF A FUCKING
COMPLIMENT TO GIVE TO A MOVIE.
\h\h\hAND I‘M NOT
OVER-PRAISING IT.
THE THING I REMEMBER
ABOUT "NEXT OF KIN"
MORE THAN ANYTHING IS
\h\h\hTHE FINAL SHOT.
THE IDEA WAS THE CAMERA WOULD
\h\h\hCRANE FROM A HIGH ANGLE
AS THE GIRL CAME OUT
\h\h\h\hOF THE DINER.
THE CAMERA TRACKS INTO
\hTHE BACK OF THE TRUCK
UNTIL WE‘RE LOOKING AT HER
\hTHROUGH THE BACK WINDOW.
\h\h\hAND AS WE PAN BACK TO
SEE WHERE WE‘VE JUST BEEN,
THE WHOLE BUILDING BLOWS UP.
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS GUY
\h\hPUSHED THE BUTTON,
AND WE HADN‘T PANNED AROUND.
AND SO THE INITIAL EXPLOSION
\h\h\hIS SEEN AS A REFLECTION
\hON THE SIGN AND BY THE
TIME WE‘D PANNED AROUND,
\h\hMOST OF IT WAS OVER.
BUT THEN THE PUBLIC SAW IT AND
SAID, "WE LOVED THAT END SHOT.
\hNOT SEEING THE EXPLOSION TILL
THE END WAS JUST SUCH RESTRAINT.
IT WAS BRILLIANT."
MANY OF US WERE VERY SNOBBY
\h\h\h\hABOUT GENRE FILMS--
THERE‘S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
\h\hWE DIDN‘T APPROVE OF THEM.
"COMMERCIAL" HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A DIRTY WORD FOR SOME REASON
\h\h\h\h\h\hIN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU GO TO PLACES LIKE
THE CANNES FESTIVAL...
\h\h90% OF THE PICTURES ARE
JUST EXPLOITATION PICTURES.
YOU HAVE ARTY PICTURES AND SEX
\hPICTURES AND MONSTER PICTURES
AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF.
\hTHEY CAN‘T GET A RELEASE.
OVERLY COMMERCIAL
\hAIN‘T THAT EASY.
( fanfare )
IF YOU GREW UP WATCHING
AUSTRALIAN GENRE FILMS,
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
\h\h\h\hOF THE MIND
\h\hTHAT, ONE: THERE‘S
A DESERT EVERYWHERE...
AND TWO: MARAUDING PACKS
\h\h\hOF BULLIES IN CARS
THAT THEY COULD
NEVER AFFORD--
SHEENING MECHANICAL MONSTERS
\h\h\hJUST ROAM THE HIGHWAY
\h\hLOOKING FOR PEOPLE
TO PICK ON, ALL RIGHT?
\h\h\h\hWOMEN TO RAPE
AND GUYS TO BEAT UP.
\h\hIN LOVE STORIES,
THOSE GUYS SHOW UP.
YOU HURT MY CAR.
\h\h\h\h\hQuentin Tarantino:
IN A MOVIE ABOUT A GIANT PIG,
\h\h\h\h\hTHOSE GUYS SHOW UP.
\hTHEY JUST ROAM THE COUNTRYSIDE
LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO FUCK WITH.
\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
The Gravediggers are
\h\h\h\hon the move--
a new breed of
motorbike gang.
Somebody wants them dead.
So the cops sent Stone.
I‘VE SEEN THIS BLOKE.
\h\h\h\h\hHE‘S A PIG.
CERTAINLY "STONE" WAS NOTHING
\hLIKE ANYTHING THAT HAD COME
\h\hOUT OF AUSTRALIAN CINEMA.
\h\hIT‘S A TRIP INTO
ALTERNATIVE CULTURE,
ROCK ‘N‘ ROLL CULTURE.
AND THAT WAS THE SORT
\h\h\h\hOF ATTITUDE...
\h\h\hONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOTS
IN THE HISTORY OF BIKER FILMS
IS THAT FUNERAL PROCESSION.
YOU JUST SEE THAT SHOT,
\h\hYOU GO, "OH MY GOD.
\h\h\h\h\hWHAT A MOVIE."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
The copper and the bike gang.
- Two lifestyles clash... G,
- SLUT!
...in a suspense thriller
\h\h\hyou cannot predict.
\h\h\h\hSandy Harbutt:
PETER ARMSTRONG‘S STUNT
IS THE MOST AMAZING THING
\hI‘VE EVER SEEN ANY HUMAN
\h\h\h\h\h\hBEING EVER DO.
AHHH!
IT KNOCKED HIM OUT.
IT WAS THE HARDEST IMPACT
I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.
AND I WAS BLACK AND BLUE,
FULL OF BRUISES FOR
TWO WEEKS.
AND VERY STIFF.
BUT THE SHOT WAS WORTH IT.
\h\h\hWHILE WE WERE MAKING
\h\hTHE PICTURE I THOUGHT,
"WE‘RE GOING TO FUCK UP."
IT WAS A ROLLER-COASTER RIDE.
\h\h\h\hWHAT I DECIDED TO DO WAS
ACTUALLY FORM A MOTORCYCLE CLUB
AND SHOOT THE PICTURE
\h\h\h\h\hAS A CLUB.
\h\hIT WAS AS SEXIST IN
PRODUCTION AS THE WORLD
THAT IT WAS PORTRAYING.
SHUT YOUR FACE, TART.
\h\hTHE ACTORS VERY MUCH
EMBRACED THE REALITY OF
\hBECOMING A BIKIE GANG.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRebecca Gilling:
THE WOMEN DID AS THEY WERE TOLD
AND THE BLOKES SEEMED TO
\h\h\h\hHAVE ALL THE FUN.
I CAN‘T SAY I ENJOYED
\h\hWORKING ON IT ALL.
WE HAD ONE EXTRAORDINARY
\h\h\h\h\hSCENE IN THAT
WHICH TOOK 25 HOURS TO FILM,
\h\h\h\h\hSMOKING REAL DOPE.
\h\h\h\hBUT IT WAS
A RADICAL PICTURE!
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIan Barry:
\hSEVERAL OF THE SEQUENCES
INVOLVED THE HELLS ANGELS.
I GOT ON THE BALCONY OF
\h\hTHE HOTEL AND TOP OF
\h\hMY VOICE YELLED OUT,
"ALL THE HELLS ANGELS
\h\h\h\hARE POOFTERS."
\hTHAT WAS THE MOMENT
THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE
\h\hGOING TO BE DEAD.
OH, YOU‘VE GOT TO BE DUMB
\h\hNOT TO BE SCARED BY...
A GROUP OF TOUGH BIKERS...
BECAUSE NOTHING
WILL STOP THEM.
THERE WAS A FIGHT SCENE
\h\h\h\hOUTSIDE THE PUB.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BRAWL
\hTHAT ENDED UP BEING A BRAWL.
\h\h\h\h\hIan Barry:
THE REMUNERATION FOR
\h\hTHE HELLS ANGELS
UNFORTUNATELY WAS IN BEER.
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHEY WENT BERSERK
THAT NIGHT AND JUST BASHED UP
\h\h\h\h\hEVERYBODY IN SIGHT.
\h\h\h\hTHERE WAS A GUY THERE
WITH TWO GIRLS AND HE GOT INTO
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hA DISCUSSION
- WITH ONE OF THE CLUB MEMBERS.
- WHAT‘S YOUR PROBLEM?
AND HE SAID STUPID THINGS
\h\h\h\hLIKE, "FUCK OFF!"
\h\h\h\h\h\hDavid Hannay:
SO THEY TOOK HIS SCALP OFF.
\h\h\h\hNEVER SEEN SO
MUCH BLOOD IN MY LIFE.
IT WAS ALL OVER THE CEILING
\h\hAND ALL OVER THE WALLS.
\h\h\h\h\h\hYOUSE BLOKES--
YOUSE ARE NOT REAL GOOD AT
PUBLIC RELATIONS, ARE YOU?
SANDY WAS HOPING IN A WAY
\hTHAT SOMETHING DANGEROUS
WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THEN
\hHE COULD GET IT ON FILM.
HE‘D MADE A TOTAL COMMITMENT
\hTO EMBRACE THE REBELLIOUS.
CUT IT.
\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
The director of "Stone"
\h\h\his Sandy Harbutt.
He plays a leading
\hrole in the film.
He co-authored
the screenplay,
\h\h\hand consequently "Stone"
is very much an auteur picture.
\h\h\h\hHE‘S LIKE A TRUE,
REAL VISIONARY, ALL RIGHT,
WHO ACTUALLY HAS THE GOODS
\h\h\h\h\hAND ACTUALLY DELIVERS
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF IMPACT.
AFTER ALL THE COOL STUFF
THAT HAPPENS IN "STONE,"
THEN IT JUST HAS MAYBE
\hTHE MOST AUTHENTIC,
\hREALISTIC ENDING OF A BIKER
MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF FILM.
\hTHEY JUST SHORT OF
STOMP HIM TO DEATH.
BUT HE UNDERSTANDS
\h\hTHE BIKE CODE.
NO COPS.
AFTER HE GETS HIS KICKING,
\h\h\h\h\hHE WORKS IT OUT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTarantino:
HE KNOWS HE HAD IT COMING.
I THINK HE WANTED THEIR RESPECT.
HOPEFULLY HE GOT IT.
I SUPPOSE HE BECOMES ONE OF THEM
BY TAKING THE PUNISHMENT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Critics and bikies alike
\h\h\h\hhave acclaimed it
as the first honest appraisal
\h\h\h\h\hof their lifestyle.
Take the trip.
ROLLING, SPEED, BUZZER,
\h\hCLAPBOARD, TAKE SIX,
BANG CLANK, POWDERPUFF,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hACTION.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
They called him Mad Dog Morgan.
- He was the outlaw‘s outlaw.
- YOU.
WE WANTED TO FIND A PERSONALITY
WHO WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF ECHO
OF AMERICAN CINEMA,
\hOF WESTERN CINEMA.
\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\h\hDennis Hopper
is Mad Dog Morgan.
WE WERE JUST THRILLED TO HAVE
\h\h\h"EASY RIDER" AS MAD DOG.
- HOWDY.
- Jeremy Thomas:
\h\hWE‘VE GOT A GENUINE OUTLAW.
LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT
\hHAVING THE REAL THING
WAS GOING TO MAKE THE FILM
SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO MAKE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHEY.
COME BACK HERE, HORSE.
\hI SAID COME BACK HERE OR I‘LL
BASH YOU ON THE HEAD WITH THIS.
MAD DOG MORGAN WAS
\h\hA PSYCHOPATH.
\hAND DENNIS BROUGHT
THAT INTENSITY TO IT.
IT WAS EASY.
EASY, I DON‘T KNOW,
BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS.
\h\hARROGANT SON OF A BITCH,
SPEAKING IN AN IRISH ACCENT
\h\h\h\h\h\hALL OF THE TIME.
EASY RIDER HERE.
\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
DENNIS WAS A FULL-ON
\h\h\h\hMETHOD ACTOR.
I‘VE COME FOR OPIUM.
THAT WAS CONVENIENT FOR HIM
\h\h\hBECAUSE MAD DOG DRANK
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hA LOT OF RUM,
WHICH DENNIS HAD RESEARCHED
\h\h\h\hBEFORE HE ARRIVED.
I GOT THAT PART OF IT RIGHT,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hFOR SURE.
\h\h\h\h\h\hJeremy Thomas:
HE WAS ARRESTED AND PUT IN
\h\h\h\hJAIL WITHIN A NIGHT
OF HIM ARRIVING IN SYDNEY.
HE WAS ALREADY IN FIGHTING
\h\h\h\hDOWN AT THE PUBS.
HE SNORTED A LOT OF COCAINE.
\hHE STARTED DRINKING WHEN
HE WOKE UP IN THE MORNING,
\h\h\hWHICH IS VERY EARLY.
\hDENNIS COLLAPSED IN
THE MIDDLE OF SCENES.
\h\h\h\h\hHE WAS 39 WHEN
WE WERE MAKING THE FILM.
I REALLY BELIEVED HE WOULD
\h\h\h\h\h\hNEVER HIT 40.
\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
DAVID JUST COMPLETELY
\h\h\h\hDISAPPEARED.
\h\h\hFOUR DAYS LATER,
THEY BRING DAVID BACK.
\h\h\h\h\h\hI SAID TO DAVID,
"YOU CAN‘T JUST GO WALKABOUT
\h\hIN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOOT.
IT‘S BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM."
AND HE SAID, "OH, I HAD TO
\hASK THE KOOKABURRAS AND
\hTHE TREES ABOUT DENNIS."
AND I SAID, "REALLY?
\hWHAT DID THEY SAY?"
\h\h\h\h\h\hDAVID SAID, "WELL,
THE KOOKABURRAS AND THE TREES
\h\hALL SAY DENNIS IS CRAZY."
\hAND I SAID, "LOOK, DAVID,
I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT."
ARGGH ARGHHH ARGHH.
WHEN I GOT TO THAT 151 RUM,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU KNOW,
IT WAS DEFINITELY ON
\hTHE ROAD TO HELL.
I‘LL TAKE YOU TO THE WILDS,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO AUSTRALIA,
\h\h\h\hWHERE THERE‘S
17 WOMEN TO EVERY MAN.
\h\h\h\h\h\hJohn Seale:
REHEARSALS, FORGET IT-- ,
\hBE READY FOR ANYTHING.
HE WALKED BEHIND THE CAMERA. Y
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIT WAS LIKE,
\h\h"YOU KEEP UP WITH ME.
OTHERWISE YOU‘RE A GONER."
\h\h\h\hPhilippe Mora: WE WERE
\h\hREADY TO SHOOT AND I SAID,
"DENNIS, WHERE ARE YOUR BOOTS?
AND HE SAYS, "FUCK BOOTS, MAN,
\h\h\h\h\hI‘M MAD DOG MORGAN."
\h\h\h\hI SAID, "I KNOW YOU‘RE
MAD DOG MORGAN, BUT YESTERDAY
\h\hMAD DOG HAD HIS BOOTS ON.
\h\h\h\hIT‘S THE SAME SCENE.
IT‘S NOT ABOUT MAGIC BOOTS."
\hHE‘S FIRED, MAN.
HEY, OFF THE SET.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
HERE WE GO.  QUIET PLEASE.
\h\h\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
THERE WAS ONE SCENE WHERE
\h\hMAD DOG MORGAN DIES.
AND THERE WAS AN OLD ACTOR
\h\hWHO HAD TO PUT HIS HEAD
\h\h\h\hON DENNIS‘S CHEST,
- LOOK UP AND SAY, "HE‘S DEAD."
- HE‘S DEAD.
\h\h\h\h\hDENNIS WAS OBVIOUSLY
STILL ALIVE-- HE WAS GURGLING.
\hAND SO I SAID, YOU KNOW,
"WHAT‘S WRONG?  OBVIOUSLY
\h\h\h\h\hHE‘S NOT DEAD."
\h\h\hHE SAID, "LOOK,
\hI NEEDED THE MONEY.
I DIDN‘T TELL ANYONE.
I‘M COMPLETELY DEAF AND I CAN‘T
SEE ANYTHING REALLY."
HE SAID, "I‘VE GOT AN IDEA:
\h\h\hGET A 20‘ LONG STICK,
AND WHEN YOU WANT ME TO SAY
\h\h\h"HE‘S DEAD," POKE ME.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI SAID,
"THAT‘S A BLOODY GOOD IDEA."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSO DENNIS DIES,
I POKE THE GUY-- "HE‘S DEAD."
PERFECT.  AND THEN DENNIS
\h\hGETS UP AND HE SAYS,
\h\h\h\h\h\h"LISTEN, MAN,
\h\hI‘VE WORKED WITH SOME
MOTHERFUCKERS IN MY TIME.
I‘VE WORKED WITH SOME REAL,
\h\h\h\h\hASSHOLE DIRECTORS.
BUT I‘VE NEVER WORKED
\h\h\hWITH AN ASSHOLE
WHO POKES ACTORS
\hWITH A STICK.
\hWHAT IS THAT, MAN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
\hWE‘RE NOT PUPPETS.
WE‘RE NOT ANIMALS."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDennis Hopper:
I PROCEEDED TO DOWN A BOTTLE
\h\h\h\h\h\hOF 151-PROOF RUM
\h\h\hAND THEN I DECIDED THAT
I WOULD DESTROY THE CEMETERY.
AND THEN DENNIS LEAPED
\h\hBEHIND THE WHEEL,
ANNOUNCED THAT HE USED TO BE
\h\h\h\hA RACING-CAR DRIVER.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
\h\h\hTHE POLICE STOPPED HIM,
AND HE‘S DRESSED AS MAD DOG.
THEY PRONOUNCED ME DEAD.
\h\hTHEY SAID, "YOU‘RE DEAD."
YOU KNOW?  "YOU HAVE SUCH A--
THE ALCOHOL CONTENT YOU HAVE
IN YOUR BODY-- YOU‘RE DEAD."
SO THAT WAS GOOD NEWS.
"NOT ONLY WILL YOU NOT
\hBE ALLOWED TO DRIVE
IN THE STATE OF VICTORIA..."
I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO BE
\h\hA PASSENGER IN A CAR.
"...AND YOU ARE BEING TAKEN
\hSTRAIGHT TO THE AIRPORT."
HOW WE FINISHED THE FILM,
I‘VE GOT NO IDEA, REALLY,
\h\h\hTHINKING BACK TO IT.
\hWE WEREN‘T OVER BUDGET;
WE WEREN‘T OVER SCHEDULE.
\hAND LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THEY GOT SOME MAGIC.
IT‘S YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE,
\h\h\hAND IT‘S IN THAT ORDER.
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
SAW MAX FAIRCHILD RAPING
\h\h\h\h\h\hDENNIS HOPPER
\h\hAND THE CHINESE
BEING MASSACRED...
SOME OF THEM NEARLY HAD
\h\h\h\hA HEART ATTACK.
\hTHEY SAID IT WAS,
YOU KNOW, DISASTER.
AND THEY WERE THE ONES WHO SAID
IT WOULDN‘T MAKE A DIME.
\h\h\hAND THEN "MAD DOG"
\hAT CANNES THAT YEAR WAS
THE ONLY FILM THAT SOLD.
AND IT OPENED IN THE U.S.
\h\h\h\h\hIN 40 THEATRES.
\h\h\h\hIT WAS THE FIRST
AUSTRALIAN MOVIE TO GET
\hAN OPENING LIKE THAT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\h\hOutwitting, outriding,
outgunning an army of police,
here at last is the truth
\h\habout Mad Dog Morgan.
\hIT BECAME CLEAR
TO ME THAT ACTION
WAS THE UNIVERSAL CURRENCY
\h\h\hOF THE MOVIE MARKET.
AND ACTION, YOU KNOW,
\hTRANSCENDED ALL
LANGUAGE BARRIERS.
\h\hA GOOD PUNCH-UP PLAYS
JUST AS WELL IN HONG KONG,
AUSTRALIA, ICELAND,
ARGENTINA-- EVERYWHERE.
\h\h\h\hHal McElroy:
THE BRUCE LEE KUNG-FU
\h\hCHOP-SOCKY MOVIES
WERE QUITE POPULAR.  AND BRIAN
\h\h\hTHOUGHT, "WHY NOT HERE?
WHY NOT ON TOP OF
\h\h\hAYERS ROCK?"
♪ YOU ♪
♪ YOU‘VE BLOWN IT ALL
\h\h\h\h\hSKY HIGH ♪
♪ A LOVE THAT WINS
\h\h\h\h\hTONIGHT ♪
♪ YOU COULD HAVE
TOUCHED THE SKY ♪
♪ YOU‘VE BLOWN IT ALL
\h\h\h\h\hSKY HIGH. ♪
THE MOVIE FUCKING
\hKICKS ASS, MAN.
\hIT‘S A REALLY GOOD FILM
AND HOLDS UP TO THIS DAY.
THIS IS INSPECTOR FANG SEN LAN
FROM HONG KONG.
A CHINESE "DIRTY HARRY"
\h\h\hCOMES TO AUSTRALIA
\hAND WRECKS THE PLACE
IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE.
"DON‘T WORRY ABOUT WHAT
HE MIGHT HAVE SAID.
DON‘T WORRY ABOUT
GATHERING EVIDENCE.
OH NO, MAN, JUST..."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Asia‘s international superstar
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJimmy Wang Yu
arrives in Sydney to star in
\h\h"The Man From Hong Kong."
Jimmy Wang Yu is regarded
as Asia‘s Steve McQueen.
- JIMMY WAS JUST HORRIBLE.
- A NASTY PIECE OF WORK.
ONE OF THE TWO WORST PEOPLE
I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH
IN MY LIFE.
DON‘T GIVE ME ANY SHIT.
\h\h\h\hHE BASICALLY HAD
NO RESPECT FOR ANYBODY.
WHITE WOMEN WERE... SCUM.
\hAND WHITE ACTRESSES
WERE WORSE THAN SCUM.
\h\hAND REBECCA, CHARMING
AND WONDERFUL AS SHE IS,
\hWAS OF COURSE THEREFORE JUST
A PIECE OF DIRT ON THE GROUND.
\h\h\hAND HE HAD TO DO
A LOVE SCENE WITH HER.
DO YOU THINK YOU‘RE
RECOVERED ENOUGH FOR ME
TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU?
I THINK I COULD
STAND THE PAIN.
HE INSISTED ON CATCHING
\h\h\hFLIES FROM THE AIR
\h\h\hAND EATING THEM
BEFORE HE KISSED HER.
- WHAT?  HE WHAT?
- LOOK, I DIDN‘T WARM TO HIM.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJohn Seale:
\h\h\hBRIAN USED TO STAND IN
FOR JIMMY IN THE LOVE SCENES
SO THAT HE COULD LIE ON TOP
\h\h\h\hOF REBECCA GILLING.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAND HE‘D SAY,
"THIS IS THE SORT OF ANGLE.
\hJOHN HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED."
\hAND HE‘S LYING RIGHT
\h\h\h\hON TOP OF HER.
AND SHE‘S LYING THERE GOING...
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT,
ACUPUNCTURE?
\h\h\h\hWANG YU WAS
A TOP STAR IN ASIA.
\h\h\h\hAND HE‘D ALSO DIRECTED
EIGHT MOVIES.  AND HERE WAS I,
THIS KID, DIRECTING
\h\hHIS FIRST MOVIE
WITH A BUDGET FOUR TIMES
\h\hTHE SIZE OF ANYTHING
\h\h\h\hWANG YU HAD HAD.
JIMMY WANG YU WANTED TO BE
\h\hTHE BOSS OF THE SHOW.
HE WANTED TO BE
\hTHE DIRECTOR.
\h\h\h\hAND BRIAN WAS
HANDLING IT SO WELL.
HE ACTUALLY DID A PRETTY
GOOD JOB BECAUSE IT WAS
PRETTY DEMANDING ON HIM,
\h\h\hNOT ONLY DIRECTING IT,
\h\hBUT PERFORMING IN IT AND
COPPING THE PUNCHES AS WELL.
EVERY TIME I LOOK
\h\h\hAT THE FILM
\h\h\hAND SEE HIM KICKING
THE SHIT OUT OF BRIAN...
THAT‘S NOT ACTING.
HE TREATED ME BADLY.
A MASTER OF KUNG FU--
HE USED HIS ART
FOR AN EVIL PURPOSE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRoger Ward:
I SAID TO BRIAN, "LOOK, DO YOU
WANT ME TO TAKE CARE OF JIMMY?
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE
\h\h\hHIM A HIDING?"
BECAUSE I WAS QUITE PREPARED
\h\h\hTO DO THAT FOR BRIAN.
AND BRIAN SAID "NO NO NO.
\hI‘LL WIN MY BATTLE
AT THE BOX OFFICE."
\h\h\h\hAND HE DID.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
George Lazenby is Jack Wilton,
\h\h\h\h\hruthless czar
of international evil.
\hI NEEDED SOME MONEY
AND I HAD A HARD TIME
\hGETTING A JOB IN
THE FILM BUSINESS.
\h\h\hBECAUSE OF MY RECORD
AS JAMES BOND, I WOULDN‘T
\h\h\hSIGN THEIR CONTRACT.
SO I WAS BASICALLY
\h\h\hBLACKLISTED.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGrant Page:
HE‘D HAD A MOMENT OF GLORY.
\h\hAND I THINK HE‘D ACCEPTED
THE FACT THAT THINGS WEREN‘T
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT BIG ANYMORE.
\h"THE MAN FROM HONG KONG"
WAS PROBABLY THE LIMO BILL
\h\h\h\hOF THE BOND FILM.
I WANT THAT LUNATIC STOPPED.
WE DIDN‘T REALLY KNOW
\hWHAT WE WERE DOING.
WE JUST KIND OF LEAPT INTO IT
\h\h\hAND JUST TRIED TO SHOOT
THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF IT.
SOME OF IT WAS PRETTY GOOD
\h\hAND SOME WASN‘T SO GOOD,
BUT ALL OF IT WAS DANGEROUS.
\h\hTHERE WERE MANY TIMES I
THOUGHT I WOULD GET KILLED,
THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET
\h\h\hKILLED OR HURT.
THE SCENE AT AYERS ROCK
\h\hWHERE THE CAR ROLLS
\h\h\h\h\hAND BLOWS UP,
\h\h\h\h\hTHE DOOR FLIES OFF--
YOU THINK, "WHOA, THAT THING‘S
\h\h\h\hGETTING AWFUL CLOSE."
\h\hRoger Ward:
DANGEROUS STUFF.
\h\hEVERYBODY DID IT AND
JUST HOPED FOR THE BEST.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJohn Seale:
\h\h\h\hTHESE STUNTIES ARE
JUST SMASHING CARS TOGETHER
AND YOU‘RE IN IT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHal McElroy:
\h\h\h\hHIGH-SPEED CAR CHASE
SEQUENCES ON OPEN HIGHWAYS...
WITHOUT ANY TRAFFIC CONTROL,
\hWITHOUT POLICE PERMISSION,
\h\h\h\h\h\hWITHOUT ANYTHING.
WE JUST SHOT ‘EM.
IT WOULD GET OUT OF CONTROL
\h\hAND SPIN IN FRONT OF YOU
\h\h\h\hAND YOU‘D T-BONE IT.
AND YOU WERE SITTING IN
\h\hTHE PASSENGER SEAT.
MAYBE YOU HAD A SEAT BELT;
\h\h\h\hMAYBE YOU DIDN‘T.
NOBODY REALLY WORRIED
\h\h\h\h\h\hABOUT IT.
\h\hWE SAW PEOPLE HIT BY CARS
AND THEY‘D JUST PICK THEM UP:
"YOU ALL RIGHT?  HAVE A V.B.,
\h\hMATE, YOU‘LL BE ALL RIGHT.
\hJUST STAND THERE BUT MAKE
SURE YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY
\h\h\h\hA LITTLE EARLIER."
\hIT WAS CRAZY WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS JUST
A CASE OF RIDE THE BIKE DOWN
\hTHERE AND GET KICKED OFF.
\h\h\hHE JUST SAID, "YOU JUST
RIDE AT ME AND I‘LL KICK IT."
AND HE DID.
I‘D BEEN SET ON FIRE,
YOU KNOW, SEVEN TIMES
AND ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS
WAS TO SHOW GEORGE
HOW YOU COULD BE VERY
SAFELY SET ON FIRE.
\h\h\hALL THE GUYS
ARE AROUND SAYING,
\h\h\h\h\h"HEY, THIS IS
GOING TO LOOK FANTASTIC.
\hYOU‘VE GOT TO DO IT."
Brian Trenchard-Smith:
\h\hI DULY GOT LIT UP.
CHINESE CREW WERE GOING,
YOU KNOW, "THIS CRAZY GWAI LO.
WHAT‘S HE DOING NEXT?"
AND AFTER THE DIRECTOR
\hSET HIMSELF ON FIRE,
I THOUGHT, "JEEZ, IF HE‘S GOING
TO DO IT, I‘LL HAVE TO DO IT."
AHHH!
KNOWING THAT IT‘S REALLY
HAPPENING, ALL RIGHT,
YOU JUST CAN‘T BUY
THAT THRILL.
\h\h\h\hYOU CAN‘T CREATE IT.
THERE‘S NO SPECIAL EFFECT...
\hBUT WHEN THEY
ACTUALLY DO IT.
Brian Trenchard-Smith:
GEORGE GOES THROUGH ALL
\h\h\h\h\hTHE MOVEMENTS
AND THEN HE HAD DIFFICULTY
\hGETTING THE JACKET OFF.
\hAND GEORGE STARTS TO
FEEL THAT HE‘S BURNING.
MY ARM WIPED OUT THE GREASE
\h\hAND THE FIRE JUST BURNT
\h\h\hMY ARM RIGHT UP HERE.
I‘VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY TRY
TO RUN AWAY FROM HIS OWN ARM
\h\h\h\hSO FAST IN MY LIFE.
GRANT TACKLED HIM TO THE GROUND
AND WE PUT THE BLANKET ON HIM.
\h\h\h\h\h\hGEORGE WAS
UNDERSTANDABLY FURIOUS.
\hHE THREW A PUNCH AT
BRIAN TRENCHARD-SMITH.
NO, I DIDN‘T.
HE JUMPED UP AND WENT WHACK!
\h\h\h\hAND DICK TRENCHARD
WHACKED HIM AND, YOU KNOW,
\h\hNEARLY BROKE HIS JAW.
I DON‘T REMEMBER
\hPUNCHING HIM.
IF I DID, I‘M SORRY.
GOSH, YOU‘RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED
TO LIGHT A MATCH ON A SET NOW
WITHOUT FULL SAFETY OFFICERS
\h\h\hAND THINGS LIKE THAT.
\hSO IT WAS PRETTY
GUNG-HO BACK THEN.
\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\hThis is Grant Page,
professional stunt man.
GRANT IS THE GUY THAT YOU GET
\h\h\h\h\h\hTO DODGE THE CARS,
SLIDE DOWN THE CLIFF ON FIRE,
JUMP INTO THE WATER
AND FIGHT THE SHARK.
\h\h\h\hGRANT PAGE WAS ONE OF
THOSE GUYS THAT YOU RESPECTED.
THE MOST FEARLESS MAN
\h\h\hI HAVE EVER MET.
HE WAS GONZO, JUST WHACKED.
( animal growling )
IN AMERICA WE JUST
CALL THAT INSANE.
\h\h\h\hHE‘S THE KIND OF GUY
\hTHAT JUST BLOCKS OUT PAIN
FOR AS LONG AS IS NECESSARY.
"IT WILL HURT LATER."
THE WHOLE SCALP WAS OPENED UP
AND SORT OF LAYING DOWN HERE.
\h\h\h\hAND I THINK THEY PUT
120-ODD STITCHES IN MY HEAD.
\h\h\h\h\h\hHE‘S STILL ALIVE.
THAT‘S A MIRACLE RIGHT THERE.
\h\h\hI HAD THIS IDEA OF MAD DOG
COMING OUT OF THE WATER ON FIRE.
THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT WAS
\h\h\hTO SET GRANT ON FIRE
AND HAVE HIM DIVE INTO WATER.
\h\h\h\h\h\hUNFORTUNATELY THEY
COULDN‘T GET THE POOL OF WATER
WITH PETROL ON IT TO LIGHT.
SO I‘M STANDING THERE ON
\hTHIS LITTLE TINY LEDGE,
THE GEL IS DRYING OUT...
AND WHEN HE WAS SET ON FIRE,
\h\h\h\h\hHE QUICKLY BURNED.
\h\h\h\h\hGrant Page:
I HAD A NARROW LEDGE TO
GET PAST DENNIS HOPPER
WITHOUT SETTING HIM ALIGHT.
\h\h\h\h\hRichard Brennan:
GRANT MOVED SWIFTLY AWAY IN
\h\h\hTHE WRONG DIRECTION.
IT WAS HARD TO GET
\h\h\hHOLD OF HIM.
\h\h\h\h\hPhilippe Mora:
HE STARTED SCREAMING AND
\h\hTHEN HE WAS PUT OUT.
HE WENT TO HOSPITAL AND HE
\h\hWAS BURNT QUITE BADLY.
IT WAS NOT PAINFUL ENOUGH
\hTO KEEP ME IN HOSPITAL.
SORRY ABOUT THAT
GOING WRONG THERE,
BUT IT‘S SUCH A DRYING DAY.
A VERY DANGEROUS STUNT.
WE PREPARED THE STUNT
\h\h\h\hTHE NEXT DAY.
\h\h\h\h\hTHE MAJOR PART WAS
THE BACK FALL INTO THE WATER.
John Seale:
THAT WAS 80‘.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGrant Page:
A LOT OF ROCK ON THE BOTTOM--
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hQUITE JAGGED.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJohn Seale:
HE CAME UP WITH BLOOD COMING
OUT OF HIS EARS AND HIS NOSE.
OH, HE TOOK A HECK OF
\h\h\hA BANG ON THAT.
21 YEARS IN THE BUSINESS,
I‘VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
I‘VE WORKED FOR ALL THE MANIACS:
HATHAWAY, GEORGE STEVENS.
ALL THE MANIACS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
\hI‘VE ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING
THAT GRANT WAS INDESTRUCTIBLE.
\h\h\hBRIAN WAS MY REASON FOR
STARTING IN THE FILM INDUSTRY.
HE HAD HEARD OF SOME OF
THE OLD STORIES OF WHAT
\h\hHAD HAPPENED BEFORE
\hAND THOUGHT THEY
WERE WORTH FILMING.
Brian Trenchard-Smith:
\h\h\hI THOUGHT, "WELL,
\h\h\h\hTHIS IS SOMEONE
WHO SHOULD BE IN FRONT
\h\h\h\hOF THE CAMERA."
I OFFER YOU REAL EXCITEMENT,
\h\h\h\hA GENUINE TEST OF
\h\hYOUR SKILLS, INGENUITY
AND BLOOD-COOLING COURAGE.
\h\h\h\hI OFFER YOU
UNMISTAKABLE DANGER,
PLUS A LOT OF FUN.
\hIT‘S NOT MUCH, I KNOW,
BUT THAT‘S ALL I‘VE GOT.
\h\h\h\hBrian Trenchard-Smith:
A DUTCH DISTRIBUTOR HAD BOUGHT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h"DEATHCHEATERS"
AND SAID, "IF YOU EVER HAVE
A BRIGHT IDEA FOR ANOTHER FILM,
COME AND SEE US."
SO I SAID I‘VE GOT THIS IDEA
\h\h\h\hCALLED "STUNT ROCK."
♪ STUNT ROCKER... ♪
\h\hFAMOUS AUSTRALIAN
STUNTMAN MEETS FAMOUS
AMERICAN ROCK GROUP.
\h\h\h\hMUCH STUNT AND
MUCH ROCK TAKES PLACE.
\h\h\hTHE KIDS WILL

WHAT‘S NOT TO LIKE?
THE DUTCH COMPANY SAID,
\h\h\h\h"FIND A BAND BY MONDAY

♪ OOH YEAH... ♪
SO I WENT AND FOUND A BAND
\hTHAT YOU FIND BY MONDAY.
\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\hThe new discovery

BRIAN FOUND THIS GROUP
OF MAGICIANS WHO ALSO
\hPLAYED INSTRUMENTS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DID BETTER
\h\hMAGIC THAN THEY DID MUSIC.
\h\h\h\hNarrator:
This dynamic combo
\h\h\hgets involved
with stuntman Grant Page,
\hand a blaze of fire,
smoke and sound erupts
\hall over the screen.
SO IT DOESN‘T HAVE,
\h\h\h\h\hYOU KNOW,
\h\h\hA THREE-ACT STRUCTURE OR
A DEEP AND MEANINGFUL STORY...
IN WHICH A CHARACTER‘S ARC
CAUSES HIM TO CHANGE
\h\hHIS WORLD VIEW.
\h\hBUT IS THAT REALLY WHAT
THE KIDS ARE INTERESTED IN?
I THINK THEY‘RE INTERESTED
\hIN GUYS BLOWING SHIT UP.
♪ OOH YEAH... ♪
IT‘S LAUGHS AND GASPS.
THAT‘S WHAT A LOT OF MY FILMS
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHAVE BEEN ABOUT.
PRINT THAT.  LET‘S SET UP FOR
\hTHE HIT-AND-RUN NOW, PLEASE.
\h\hAND OUT OF GRANT PAGE
AND BRIAN TRENCHARD-SMITH
\h\h\h\h\hCOMES "MAD MAX."
GRANT PAGE BROKE HIS LEG
AND THE LEAD LADY‘S LEG
ON THE WAY OUT TO LOCATION
ON A MOTORBIKE ON DAY ONE.
\h\h\h\h\hWHEN GIBSON MET HIM,
THE FIRST DAY I THINK HE WAS ON
CRUTCHES AND ARMS IN PLASTER.
"THIS IS YOUR STUNTMAN."
\h\h\h\h\h\h"OH MY GOD."
WHEN YOU SEE THAT VEHICLE
GO THROUGH THE CARAVAN...
- HE‘S DRIVING WITH
\hHIS LEG IN PLASTER.
- OH, MAN.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDavid Eggby:
HE FLEW THROUGH THE CARAVAN
\hAND COLLECTED THE BONGO.
AND I REMEMBER IT SPINNING.
\h\hAND WE WERE ALL AMAZED
AT HOW MANY TIMES IT SPUN.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
\h\h\h"MAD MAX" WAS
B-MOVIE FILMMAKING
WITH A-MOVIE ASPIRATIONS.
WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD TO
FULFILL FANTASIES
OF A LARGE CROSS-SECTION OF
THE AUDIENCE
TO A DEGREE THAT WOULD SATISFY
US IF WE WERE SITTING THERE
WATCHING OUR OWN PROGRAM,
AND PAYING $5 TO DO SO.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGeorge Miller:
IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAD AUTOCIDE
\h\h\h\hRATHER THAN HOMICIDE.
BECAUSE I WAS WORKING IN
\h\hA BIG CITY HOSPITAL,
\hI WAS AT THE SORT
OF COALFACE OF THAT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIT WAS VERY
VERY CONFRONTING FOR ME.
\hI WAS INTERESTED IN
A CHARACTER LIKE MAX
WHO WAS IN VERY BRUTAL WORLD...
AND BASICALLY TRYING TO
AVOID HIS BRUTAL NATURE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Into a world without law,
a world without order,
comes a man without fear.
JUST THE IDEA THAT THIS DOCTOR
WITH HIS OWN MONEY
WENT OUT THERE
AND SET UP ROADBLOCKS
AND SHOT THESE SCENES.
FOR US FILM KIDS, IT WAS
SO INSPIRATIONAL TO KNOW
THAT THAT‘S WHAT THEY DID.
THOSE CRAZY STUNTS
SHOT ON WEEKENDS,
WITH DAVID EGGBY HANGING OFF
\h\hTHE BACK OF A MOTORBIKE.
\h\h\h\hTHERE WAS A SEQUENCE
IN IT WHERE THE GOOSE LEAVES
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHE NIGHTCLUB...
AND THERE‘S THIS ONE BIKE...
DAVID‘S SITTING UP IN
HIS SHORTS AND T-SHIRT
\h\h\h\hWITH HIS CAMERA OVER
THE LENS FILMING THE SPEEDO.
\h\h\h\h\hDavid Eggby:
THE SPEEDO WAS HITTING
\h\h\h\h\h\hAT 180kmh.
IT BECAME GONZO FILMMAKING
\hBECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING
IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWED YOU
\h\hTO BLOCK OFF THIS ROAD
AND THEN DRIVE A CAR OVER
\h\h\h\h\hTHE SPEED LIMIT
AND ROLL IT AND CRASH IT
\h\h\hINTO ANOTHER CAR.
I‘M A FUEL-INJECTED
SUICIDE MACHINE.
\h\h\h\hTHE NIGHT RIDER‘S CAR
IMPACTS WITH A PETROL BOWSER.
\h\h\h\h\hIT WAS A GENUINE,
GOVERNMENT-ORDINANCE ROCKET
IN THE BOOT OF THE CAR.
\h\h\h\h\hI KNEW THAT WE WERE
RISKING OUR LIVES, AND OFTEN.
AND I KNEW THAT THE GUYS ON
\hTHE BIKES WERE IN A VERY
\h\h\hDANGEROUS SITUATION.
\h\h\hTHE BIKE BESIDE IT
FLIPPED SIDEWAYS AND...
SLAPS HIM IN THE HEAD
\h\h\hAS IT CONNECTS.
\h\h\hHE FELT A BIT OF A BELT,
ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM A HEADACHE.
\hWE DIDN‘T KILL ANYBODY,
BUT WE DAMAGED SOME GOODS.
THERE WAS A LOT OF CHAOS.
NUMEROUS BROKEN BONES--
\hLEGS AND COLLARBONES.
\h\h\h\hIT APPEARED TO DAVID
THAT IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL.
WE DIDN‘T KNOW WHETHER
WE HAD A FILM OR NOT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHE AND GEORGE CAME
TO LOGGERHEADS ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
\h\h\h\h\hWHERE THINGS SHOULD
BE SHOT FROM, AND I KNOW THAT
\h\h\hTHEY HAD THEIR BATTLES.
\h\h\h\h\hTHERE WAS TWO
DIFFERENT SENSIBILITIES.
\h\h\h\hI KNEW THERE WAS
A DIFFERENT WAY TO SHOOT,
BUT NO ONE HAD SHOT LIKE
\h\h\hTHAT IN AUSTRALIA.
AND THAT WAS WHERE
THE CONFLICT WAS.
\h\h\h\h\h\hDavid Eggby:
GEORGE WAS THE VISIONARY.
THE TECHNIQUE OF FILMMAKING
\h\hHE WAS INEXPERIENCED AT.
I COULD HEAR THE MURMURINGS.
THEY WERE SAYING, "GOD, WE ONLY
GOT NINE SETUPS TODAY.
IF WE‘D SHOT WITH SUCH-AND-SUCH
DIRECTOR, WE‘D GET 43."
THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION
SIDE OF IT, HE HATED.
IT WAS LIKE WARFARE.
\h\h\h\h\hI DIDN‘T KNOW WHERE
THE BULLETS WERE COMING FROM.
I DIDN‘T KNOW WHERE
\h\hTHE MINES WERE.
\h\h\h\hI DON‘T KNOW HOW A FILM
WHICH ULTIMATELY WAS SUCCESSFUL
CAME OUT OF THAT EXPERIENCE.
\h\h\h\hTHE FILM WAS
PRETTY WELL ACCEPTED
AND PEOPLE SAW IT AS
\h\h\h\hA NEW WAVE.
THE IMPACT ON AUDIENCES
\h\h\hWAS MIND-BOGGLING.
IT REALLY GOT TO THEM.
WE RAMMED IT DOWN
\h\hTHEIR THROATS.
YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT
\h\h\h\hDOING 100kmh
\h\h\hWITH THE LENS
6" OFF THE GROUND,
\h\h\h\hWITH A WIDE ANGLE AND
THE FUN OF A CAR DODGING FROM
\h\h\h\hONE SIDE TO THE NEXT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGeorge Miller:
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT WAS THE THING
THAT ULTIMATELY DIFFERENTIATED
"MAD MAX," I THINK,
\hFROM OTHER FILMS.
THE VIOLENCE THAT WAS SHOWN
AND THE VIOLENCE THAT WAS
\h\hPOWERFULLY IMPLIED...
\h\h\h\hREALLY KNOCKED
THE STUFFING OUT OF ME.
I‘VE SAT THROUGH HOURS
\h\hOF LOOKING AT FILMS
OUT OF THE DEATH CAMPS.
\hI REMEMBER THERE WAS
A REVIEW OUT OF INDIA
WHICH SAID THE PEOPLE WHO MADE
THIS FILM SHOULD BE DRAGGED INTO
THE STREET AND HUNG.
I ACTUALLY WENT AND SAW IT AFTER
READING THIS HORRIBLE REVIEW.
\h\h\hALL RIGHT? I‘M LIKE,
"THIS MOVIE FUCKING ROCKS."
"MAD MAX" IS A TERRIFIC PICTURE,
BUT YOU KNOW,
IT‘S NOT ALL THAT ORIGINAL,
\h\h\h\h\hFOR CHRIST‘S SAKE.
Leigh Whannell: SOME GUY
JUST GETS PUSHED TOO FAR.
\h\hHIS FAMILY GOES DOWN.
THAT‘S WHAT THE FIRST
"MAD MAX" IS--
JUST A STRAIGHT UP
‘70s REVENGE MOVIE.
SO AT THE END,
HE‘S AN ANTI-HERO.
\h\hAND HE‘S DRIVING ALONG
AND HE HAPPENS UPON JOHNNY,
THE BOY WHO‘S RECENTLY
\h\h\h\hKILLED SOMEONE.
HE MAKES HIM HANDCUFF
\h\h\h\h\h\hHIS ANKLE
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR AND
THEN THROWS HIM THE HACKSAW.
THE CHAIN IN THOSE HANDCUFFS
IS HIGH-TENSILE STEEL.
IT WILL TAKE YOU 10 MINUTES TO
\h\hHACK THROUGH IT WITH THIS.
NOW IF YOU‘RE LUCKY,
YOU CAN HACK THROUGH YOUR
\h\hANKLE IN FIVE MINUTES.
THAT‘S THE CENTRAL CONCEIT
OF THE FIRST "SAW,"
IS THESE GUYS WITH A HACKSAW
HAVING TO CUT THROUGH A CHAIN.
HE DOESN‘T WANT US TO CUT
\h\h\hTHROUGH OUR CHAINS.
\h\h\h\hHE WANTS US TO
CUT THROUGH OUR FEET.
SO IT WAS DEFINITELY A BIG
DIRECT INFLUENCE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMan:
"MAD MAX" LITERALLY STARTED
\h\h\h\hTHAT WHOLE SUBGENRE
OF ITALIAN POST-APOCALYPTIC,
\hYOU KNOW, ACTION PICTURES.
\h\h\h\h\hIT GETS COPIED A LOT
INTERNATIONALLY BUT HERE, NO,
\h\hYOU DON‘T GET A FOLLOW ON.
\h\h\hTHE EXPECTATION WAS AT
THE TIME THAT WITH "MAD MAX"
\h\h\h\hBEING SO SUCCESSFUL,
\hTHAT THERE WOULD BE A 150
CAR-CHASE FILMS MADE HERE.
\h\h\h\h\hIT DIDN‘T HAPPEN.
\h\h\h\h\h\hGeorge Miller:
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO EMULATE,
\h\h\hBUT I THINK AUSTRALIAN
FILMMAKING WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY
\h\h\hON A DIFFERENT COURSE,
\h\h\h\hCATCHING UP
WITH PERIOD PIECES.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN A WAY,
"CHAIN REACTION" DID FOLLOW.
\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Somehow the one thing
\h\h\h\hthat should never
have happened has begun.
\h\h\h\h\h\hSoon the dead
could be the lucky ones.
GEORGE MILLER IN FACT CAME OUT
\h\hAND DIRECTED SECOND UNIT.
\hTIME FOR A BIT
OF DUCO DAMAGE.
I DON‘T THINK GEORGE
\hHAD CHOREOGRAPHED
\h\h\hA LOT ON DIRT.
IT‘S VERY DIFFERENT TO TAR.
\h\h\h\hYOU CAN‘T SQUEAL THE
\h\h\h\h\h\hWHEELS ON DIRT.
Arna-Maria Winchester:
\h"CHAIN REACTION" WAS
\h\h\hA CAR-CHASE ROMP.
\hTHAT WAS THE ENGINE
THAT DROVE THE STORY
BUT THE BASIC STORY
ALSO HAD SOME DEPTH
\h\h\hAND INTEREST.
\hA CHAIN REACTION
OF CONTAMINATION.
A NUCLEAR SPILL...
DONE ON THE CHEAP WITH THIS
\hLARRY STILLSON CHARACTER
TRYING TO GET A BIT
\h\hOF QUALITY TIME
WITH HIS LEOPARD-PRINT-
\h\h\h\h\hDRESSED WIFE.
\h\h\h\hNOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT AS AN IDEA.
\hTHE WHOLE NUCLEAR MESSAGE
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY
\h\h\hTOPICAL AT THAT TIME.
I THINK ENTERTAINMENT
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWON OUT
AND THE MESSAGE PROBABLY
\h\h\hTOOK THE BACK SEAT.
ROMANCE, SEX, CAR CHASES.
YOU KNOW, THERE‘S SOMETHING
\h\h\hFOR EVERYBODY, REALLY.
NOBODY SHOOTS A CAR
THE WAY AUSSIES DO.
THEY MANAGE TO SHOOT CARS
WITH THIS FETISHISTIC LENS
THAT JUST MAKES YOU
\hWANT TO JERK OFF.

A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT
WHERE A SPRINT CAR DRIVER
HITS AN ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN
\h\h\h\hWHO WAS RUNNING AWAY
\hFROM HIS PROTECTED CAMERA
POSITION AND HE WAS KILLED.
WE JUST WEREN‘T AS CAREFUL
\hABOUT THE SAFETY THINGS
\h\h\h\h\h\hAS WE ARE NOW.
\hAND IT WASN‘T QUITE
AS TIGHTLY CONTROLLED
\hAND, YOU KNOW, THINGS
OCCASIONALLY WENT WRONG.
\hWE DID HAVE A VERY
DISTRESSING INCIDENT
ON "YANKEE ZEPHYR."
\h\h\h\h\h\hVince Monton:
\h\h\h\h\hWE HAD A JETBOAT
THAT WAS GOING TO BE DRIVEN
\h\h\h\h\hBY KEN WAHL
AND DONALD PLEASANCE.
THEY WERE GOING TO DRIVE THROUGH
THESE RAPIDS
WHICH WE WERE ASSURED
\hWERE VERY GENTLE AND
\h\h\h\h\hNO PROBLEMS.
\h\hTHE JETBOAT DRIVER
JUMPED INTO THE JETBOAT
AND TOOK IT FOR A RUN
AND THE BOAT WAS COMPLETELY
\hDEMOLISHED IN THE RAPIDS.
THE JETBOAT DRIVER
AND ANOTHER PERSON
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAND ULTIMATELY
A THIRD PERSON WERE KILLED.
WE WERE PERHAPS LUCKY
\h\hTHAT THERE WEREN‘T
\h\h\h\hMORE MISHAPS.
\h\h\h\hDIRECTING HIGH-END
ACTION PICTURES IS A VERY
\h\h\h\hSPECIALIST SKILL.
YOU THINK I‘M SUPPOSED
TO BE IMPRESSED
BY THAT KIND OF FLYING?
I AM NOT!
\h\h\h\hTony Ginnane:
PROBABLY DAVID HEMMINGS
WAS NOT THAT DIRECTOR.
\h\h\h\h\hHIS DRINKING
WAS A PROBLEM ON THAT
BECAUSE IT TOOK AWAY
\h\h\h\hHIS STAMINA;
\h\h\hIT TOOK AWAY
HIS CONCENTRATION.
\h\h\h\h\hAND ONE WILL ALWAYS
LOOK BACK ON "YANKEE ZEPHYR"
AND HAVE TO ADMIT THAT PROBABLY
\h\h\hIF BRIAN TRENCHARD-SMITH
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHAD DIRECTED IT,
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A DIFFERENT FILM.
\h\hBECAUSE ALL THE ELEMENTS

IT DIDN‘T GEL.
\h\hCOULD IT HAVE BEEN

30 DAYS, NEXT CASE.
THE INDUSTRY WAS GREEDY
\hTO TAKE THE NEXT STEP
\h\h\h\hAND THIS WAS A TAX
CONCESSION CALLED 10 B.A.
YOU WOULD BE OFFERED
A 150% WRITE-OFF ON
\hA FILM INVESTMENT.
\h\h\h\hTHAT LED TO A WEALTH
OF GENRE MATERIAL BEING MADE
\h\h\h\h\h\hBECAUSE A LOT
\hOF THE FINANCIERS DIDN‘T
REALLY CARE WHAT GOT MADE.
THEY CARED ABOUT THE DEAL
\h\h\h\hAND THEY CARED ABOUT

I THINK BRIAN LIKES
\h\h\hTO EXAGGERATE.
\h\h\hTrenchard-Smith:
THE STUNTMEN WOULD BE
\h\h\hPAID TO TURN UP
AND WHATEVER THEY DID
\h\h\hWAS UP TO THEM.
THAT WAS HOW POVERTY-STRICKEN
\hTHE BUDGET SUDDENLY BECAME.
\h\h\hTHE PRODUCERS WERE OUT
AT THE RACECOURSES EVERY DAY
\h\h\h\h\hGAMBLING
TO GET MORE MONEY.
THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME
\h\h\h\h\hAT THE TRACK.
NOW...
I DON‘T THINK WE SHOT
\h\hTHAT $2.5 MILLION.
THEY THREW 25 OR 30 OR, 17--
YOU HEAR DIFFERENT STORIES.
\h\hHOW MANY PAGES OF SCRIPT
THEY THREW OUT I DON‘T KNOW.
WHEN YOU HAVE NO BEGINNING,
\h\h\h\h\hYOU HAVE NOTHING.
YOU‘RE SCREWED.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO STEVE,
\h\h\h\hI‘M NOT SURE THAT THE
\h\h\h\h\h\hSTATE OF HIS MIND
\h\h\h\h\hDURING THAT FILM
\h\hWAS SUCH THAT HE COULD
REMEMBER ANY OF THE PAGES.
\h\h\hSTAY AWAY
FROM THE TRACK.
DON‘T BLAME IT ON THE $700,000
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT WAS CUT,
\h\h\hBECAUSE THAT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
STAY AWAY FROM THE TRACK--
THAT DID HAVE SOMETHING
\h\h\h\h\hTO DO WITH IT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIF WE QUIT NOW,
EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN DIES.
WE‘VE GOT TO KEEP GOING.
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY,
I DECIDED TO MAKE IT
INTO A HIGH-CAMP
SPLATTER MOVIE.
STUNTS MAY BE EXPENSIVE,
\h\hBUT BLOOD IS CHEAP.
\h\h\h\h\hTarantino:
THE PRISONERS HAD TO
\hRECITE THIS MANTRA
\h\hWHICH BASICALLY SAYS
THEY ARE THE LOWEST FORM
\h\hOF LIFE ON EARTH...
I AM A DEVIANT, THE LOWEST
\h\hFORM OF LIFE ON EARTH.
...WHILE ROGER WARD,
THE GUARD FROM HELL,
\h\h\h\h\hIS THROWING
SHADOW PUNCHES AT HER.
\h\h\h\h\hI SAID TO HER,
\h"LOOK, I MAY SEEM LIKE
I‘M A RUTHLESS BASTARD.
BUT DON‘T BE CONCERNED,
\h\h\hI‘M ONLY ACTING."
AND I BASHED HER
\hAND BEAT HER.
I‘VE SEEN LIKE PEOPLE
GET KICKED IN MOVIES,
\h\h\h\hBUT IT LOOKS LIKE
HE‘S KICKING HER TO DEATH.
I LIKE THE WHOLE MOVIE,
\h\hBUT LIKE AFTER I SAW
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT SCENE,
\h\hI‘M GOING TO LOVE
THAT MOVIE, ALL RIGHT.
\h\h\h\h\hDO YOU WANT ME
TO BURY HER, MR. RITTER?
- SHE AIN‘T DEAD YET, DUTCH.
- I COULD DO IT ANYWAY.
ANYTHING THAT PRODUCED
\h\hA GORY LOOK, GOOD.
\h\h\h\h\hTRENCHARD-SMITH‘S
GOOD AT THAT SORT OF THING.
HE‘S GOOD AT MAKING SPLATTER
\h\hAND HE‘S GOOD
AT DEVISING MEANS
WHERE PEOPLE‘S TOES
\hARE RIPPED OFF...
- THE LITTLE ONE.
- (screams )
...AND OTHER PEOPLE COME
\h\h\hALONG AND EAT THEM.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHIS THING WAS
TURNED INTO A PIECE OF CRAP.
AND I HATED TO SEE IT.
AND WHEN SHE TURNED
\hTHAT ARROW AROUND
AND PUT IT IN HER THROAT
\hAND THEN HER HEAD BLEW
\h\hOFF AT THAT POINT--
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hALL IT DID
WAS MAKE SPARKS BEFORE.
\hBUT I TELL YOU WHAT DID WORK
IS WHEN I BLEW THAT HEAD OFF.
( yells )
I THOUGHT THAT ONE WORKED.
IN A WAY.
\h\h\h\h\hBob McCarron:
\h\h\hDAVID HEMMINGS WAS
THE SECOND-UNIT DIRECTOR.
\h\hAND I REMEMBER THE SCENE
WHERE ONE OF OUR ACTORS GETS
\h\h\hHIS HANDS CHOPPED OFF.
OLIVIA HAD THAT BLOODY
\hMACHETE IN HER HANDS
AND DAVID SAYS,
\h\h\h"AND CUT."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMEANING
"CUT. STOP THE FILM."
SHE THINKS HE MEANS CUT.
SO SHE GOES FOR IT...
NO NO, DON‘T CUT!
...MISSING HIS REAL
\hHANDS BY INCHES.
I WANT TO TELL YOU
\h\h\h\hSOMETHING.
NOBODY
SHOULD EVER
EVER
EVER BE HURT
ON A FILM SET.
\h\hMcCarron: E SCENE
WE ACTUALLY HAD
LIVE AMMUNITION
\h\h\hFIRED AT ACTORS
TO HIT ROCKS NEARBY.
\hWE HAD A STUNTMAN--
GLEN BOSWELL, HE WAS
\hCROSSING THE RIVER.
WHEN THE SCENE WAS FINISHED,
\h\h\hHE GOT UP AND FOUND HE
\h\h\h\hWAS STILL BLEEDING.
\h\h\h\h\hON EXAMINATION,
\h\h\h\hWE FOUND THERE WAS
A BULLET IMBEDDED IN HIM.
\hI THINK PEOPLE WERE
SHOOTING BALL BEARINGS
\h\h\h\hAT THE WATER.
\h\hI WOULD NEVER ALLOW
REAL BULLETS TO BE SHOT.
\h\h\hTHE GOOD THING
ABOUT "TURKEY SHOOT"
IS THAT IT ALLOWED US ALL
\hTO HAVE A LOT OF LAUGHS
\h\h\h\h\h\hAT THE EXPENSE
OF THE FILM ESTABLISHMENT.
DEAR OLD PHILLIP ADAMS,
\h\h\h\h\h\hNOT CONTENT
WITH TRASHING "MAD MAX,"
DECIDED THAT HE‘D BETTER
\h\h\h\hHAVE A GO AT ME.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h"TURKEY SHOOT"
\h\h\h\h\hIS ONE OF MY LEAST
FAVORITE FILMS OF ALL TIME.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI BELIEVE I SAID
THAT THE SIGHT OF LYNDA STONER
\h\h\h\hBEING STABBED
THROUGH THE LEFT NORK
BY A CARNIVOROUS LESBIAN
\hWAS TOO MUCH
FOR ME TO TAKE.
AND INDEED IT WAS.
\hHE WAS ONE OF THE ONES
WHO BOLTED OUT THE DOOR.
\h\h\h\hPERHAPS HE THOUGHT
ONE OF HIS SARCOPHAGUSSES
\h\h\h\hWAS BEING STOLEN.
IT WAS A FAR WORSE FILM
\h\h\hTHAN ANYONE COULD
\h\h\h\h\hHAVE IMAGINED.
\h\hIT HAS PROFESSIONAL
SHORTCOMINGS AS WELL AS
\h\hMORAL SHORTCOMINGS.
TOUCHDOWN.
\h\h\h\h"TURKEY SHOOT"
WAS REALLY OUT THERE.
\h\h\h\h\hBUT THAT TO ME
WAS BRIAN MAKING MOVIES.
HE JUST THREW HIMSELF
\h\hINTO EVERY MOVIE.
\h\h\h\h\hSOME OF THEM,
LIKE "BMX BANDITS" ARE--
NOT MUCH DEEP AND MEANINGFUL
\h\h\h\h\h\hSTUFF IN THERE,
BUT IT‘S GREAT
ENTERTAINMENT.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBMX Bandits,
they‘re wild in the streets,
a high-flying ride
\h\hto adventure.
THE BMX BIKE APPEALED
\h\h\h\hTO HIM GREATLY
BECAUSE IT WENT DOWN STEPS.
THEY COULD RIDE UP
THE SIDES OF WALLS.
\h\hHE COULD HAVE CAR CHASES,
EVERYTHING THAT HE LOVED DOING
WAS IN THAT MOVIE.
AND SOMEHOW IT ALL WORKED.
EVEN THE MOST CYNICAL CRITIC
IN AUSTRALIA GOT SUCKED IN.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI THINK THE MOMENT
\h\h\h\hTHEY SAW NICOLE KIDMAN,
THEY WERE DEFINITELY SUCKED IN.
\hYOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY:
TWO‘S COMPANY, THREE GETS
\h\h\h\h\hUS TALKED ABOUT.
\h\hIT RESTORED PEOPLE‘S
FAITH IN ME, I SUPPOSE.
THIS REMINDS ME
OF A REALLY GOOD MOVIE
I SAY AT THE DRIVE-IN ONCE...
"KISS THE BLOOD
OFF MY CARBURETOR."
- IT WAS A HORROR ROAD MOVIE.
- AREN‘T THEY ALL?
"FAIR GAME" HAS BAD-ASS,
SCARY, BITCHING-LOOKING
\h\hMECHANICAL MONSTERS
AND THE BAD GUYS
\h\hARE DRIVING.
GET OUT OF THE WAY,
YOU CRAZY MOLL.
\hTHEY‘RE KANGAROO KILLERS
WHICH AUTOMATICALLY MAKES
\h\h\h\hTHEM THE BAD GUYS.
AND THEY‘RE FUCKING
\h\hWITH THE CHICK.
YOU BASTARDS!
THEY WERE DESTROYING
THE HOUSE AROUND ME.
\h\hA TRUCK WOULD DO ONE TAKE
AND COME AND SMASH IN ONE WALL
AND I‘D RUN FROM THAT WALL
\h\h\h\h\hTO THE NEXT WALL.
\h\h\hIT WAS PRETTY SCARY
BUT I MADE IT OUT OF THERE
\h\hLIKE A LITTLE RABBIT.
\h\hIT‘S A CAR-- AS OPPOSED
TO AN AMERICAN SLASHER FILM,
IT‘S THE KNIFE-- AND IT‘S
THE ACCOUTREMENT OF THAT.
NO, IT‘S HOW SCARY
DOES THE CAR LOOK?
THE MALE CHARACTERS
\hWERE A LITTLE ...
A LITTLE NASTY.
\hSNAP.
GOTCHA.
AND THEY GOT EVEN NASTIER.
NO.
SO I JUST HAD TO
\h\h\hKILL THEM.
IT‘S A FEMALE
"STRAW DOGS."
\h\h\h\h\hAFTER YOU‘VE SEEN
A BUNCH OF AUSTRALIAN FILMS
\h\h\h\hAND YOU WATCH
"STRAW DOGS," YOU GO,
"WHY THE HELL DID PECKINPAH
\h\h\hSET THIS IN ENGLAND?"
\h\h\h\hTHIS IS SUCH
AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
( screams )
\h\h\hIF YOU LIKE
OUTRAGEOUS CINEMA,
\h\h\h\h\hYOU LIVE--
YOU LIVE AND BREATHE
TO WAIT FOR THOSE
\h\hWEIRD MOMENTS
\h\hTHAT HAPPEN EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE IN GENRE CINEMA
\hWHERE IT‘S LIKE
YOU CAN‘T BELIEVE
\h\h\hYOU‘RE SEEING
WHAT YOU‘RE SEEING.
\h\h\hWELL, "FAIR GAME" HAS
ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS, MAN.
AND THAT‘S WHERE AFTER FUCKING
\h\h\hTHE GIRL OVER LIKE CRAZY
THEY STRIP HER NUDE.
THEY TIE HER TO THE FRONT
\hOF THEIR MONSTER TRUCK.
AND THEN THEY JUST PROCEED
\h\hTO DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD
AT 100mph
\h\h\hWITH HER TIED NAKED
TO THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK.
\hALL RIGHT, SO SHE‘S
A HUMAN HOOD ORNAMENT.
WHO IN THE FUCK
THOUGHT OF THAT?
WHAT BRAIN THOUGHT OF IT?
\h\h\h\hWHO LET THEM DO IT?
AND THEN WHEN THEY DID IT,
\h\h\h\hWHAT THE FUCK WAS
GOING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
AS THEY‘RE SHOOTING
\h\hTHIS SEQUENCE?!
\h\h\hTO ME, THAT‘S THE REASON
YOU WATCH EXPLOITATION CINEMA--
\h\h\h\hIS TO HAVE
THOSE MOMENTS LIKE,
"IS THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?
\hAM I ACTUALLY SEEING THIS?
AM I HAVING AN ACID FLASHBACK
\h\h\h\hOR IS THIS GOING ON?"
\h\h\hIT‘S A CLASSIC MOMENT
IN GENRE CINEMA, HANDS DOWN.
THERE‘S AN AWFUL STATISTIC
\h\h\hTHAT SOMETHING LIKE
\h\hHALF THE FILMS
MADE UNDER 10 B.A.
WERE NEVER RELEASED
\hTHEY WERE SO BAD.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
The ark has been raided,
\h\h\h\hthe stone
has been romanced
\hand now the great
adventure is back.
"Sky Pirates."
It will be the ride
\h\h\hof your life.
\h\h\h\h\h"INDIANA JONES
AND THE TEMPLE OF CRAP."
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE
\h\h\hPUT THE CURSE
ON THE TERM "GENRE FILM"
\h\h\h\h\hIN AUSTRALIA.

MESH TOGETHER?
\h\h\hI DON‘T KNOW
HOW IT COULD HAVE,
\h\hIN RETROSPECT.
\h\h\h\hBUT IN AMONGST
THAT DROSS, YOU KNOW,
\hTHEY WERE STILL MAKING
BLOODY FANTASTIC FILMS,
AND SOME INCREDIBLY QUITE
\h\h\h\h\hORIGINAL FILMS.
\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Now comes a startling
\h\h\h\h\hnew vision
that takes you into the
apocalypse and beyond.
\h\h"DEAD END DRIVE-IN" IS MY
FAVORITE BRIAN TRENCHARD-SMITH
\h\h\h\h\h\hMOVIE, ALL RIGHT?
THAT‘S THE ONE YOU CAN JUST
SHOW TO ANYBODY AND ANYONE
\h\hWILL JUST RECOGNIZE IT
\h\h\hAND ACCEPT IT FOR LIKE,
YOU KNOW QUITE AN EXCEPTIONAL
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPIECE OF WORK.
- I COULD BE ODDBALL...
- SHIT, WE‘RE ON FIRE.
- ...BUT I COULD
\h\hALSO BE GLOSSY.
- ( screams )
SOMETIMES IN THE LAND
\h\h\h\hOF LOW BUDGET
IT IS HARD TO BE BOTH.
\h\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
When the show is over,
\hthere is no way out.
"Dead End Drive-in."
THE STORY AND THE IDEA
\h\hIS SO INTRIGUING.
\h\h\h\hTHE GOVERNMENT
DEAL WITH A CRIME WAVE
BY TAKING THE PURPORTED
\hCRIMINALS, YOUTH, AND
\hINCARCERATING THEM...
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTarantino:
\h\h\h\h\h\hIN A DRIVE-IN
AS A CONCENTRATION CAMP.
AS LONG AS THEY JUST GET
\h\hTO LIVE IN THEIR CARS
AND THEY KEEP CONSTANT
\h\hEXPLOITATION MOVIES
PLAYING ON THE SCREEN
\h\h\hALL THE TIME...
- OH MY GOD.
- ...IT‘S ALL GOOD,
\h\hALL RIGHT.
- FORGET THE BLOODY FILM.
- I HAVE TO SEE THE END.
\h\h\h\h\h\hTrenchard-Smith:
"DEAD END DRIVE-IN" SHOWCASES
ANOTHER GREAT AUSTRALIAN
\hSTUNTMAN-- GUY NORRIS.
\h\h\hHE WANTED TO ACHIEVE
A WORLD-RECORD TRUCK JUMP.
( man yelling )
160‘ HE FINALLY MADE
\h\h\hTHAT TRUCK GO.
\h\hTHE WRITING WAS
ALREADY ON THE WALL
BY THE TIME "DEAD END
\h\hDRIVE-IN" CAME OUT
THAT THE EXPLOITATION CINEMA
\h\hWAS JUST ON ITS WAY OUT,
\hTHAT FROM HERE ON IN
IT WOULD BE HOME VIDEO.
\hTrenchard-Smith:
\hI WANTED IT TO BE
THE ULTIMATE MOVIE
YOU COULD EVER SEE
\h\h\hIN A DRIVE-IN
\h\h\h\h\hAND DRIVE-INS
WERE RAPIDLY DYING OUT.
PEOPLE WERE SEEING THOSE KINDS
\h\h\hOF MOVIES IN THEIR HOME.
\h\h\h\h\h\hWHAT WAS SAD
\hWAS TO SEE THE GRADUAL
DECLINE OF THESE MOVIES
\hAND TO SEE THEM GET
CRAPPIER AND CRAPPIER.
I REMEMBER SEEING THIS THING
\h\h\h\h\hCALLED "BLOOD MOON"
WHICH HAD A FRIGHT BREAK
\h\hIN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
\h\hIT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
\h\hFOR THOSE WHO WERE
\hTOO SCARED TO MAKE IT
THROUGH TO THE FINALE.
\h\h\h\h\hNarrator:
Take the "Blood Moon"
\h\h\h\h\hchallenge.
Can you take the heat?
IT WAS A CHANCE FOR THEM
\h\h\h\hTO ESCAPE AND GET
\h\h\h\hTHEIR MONEY BACK.
\h\h\hI GOT MY MONEY BACK.
IT WAS LIKE, STRAIGHTAWAY,
"GIVE ME THAT MONEY BACK."
AS THE FUNDING BODIES
\h\hCAME BACK INTO IT,
\hIT‘S MUCH HARDER
FOR A FUNDING BODY
TO SAY, "HERE WE‘RE GIVING
\h\h\h\h\hTAXPAYER‘S MONEY
\h\h\h\hTO GENRE MOVIES BECAUSE
THEY‘RE SEEN AS IMPORTED FILMS,
NOT OUR CULTURE."
\h\h\h\hTHE ATTITUDE WAS
\h\h"CLEARLY THOSE GENRE
EXPLOITATION FILMS FAIL.
\h\hWE SHOULD NOT WASTE
OUR TIME ON ANY OF THEM.
WE SHOULD JUST BE MAKING
\hTHE ARTISTICALLY
MERITORIOUS THINGS
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT WE ALWAYS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING."
MORE SORT OF CULTURALLY
\h\h\h\h\h\hREFLECTIVE,
\h\h\h\h\hSOCIALLY
MEANINGFUL FILMS.
\h\hAND GENRE DIED
FOR A SHORT TIME.
MAYBE IT‘S ONLY
\h\hBECOMING NOW
THAT WE‘RE SEEING, YOU KNOW,
\h\hTHAT AUSSIE EXPLOITATION
\h\h\h\h\h\hIS ACTUALLY STARTING
TO GET SOME SORT OF RECOGNITION
\hAND SOME SORT
OF REDISCOVERY.
THERE IS A NEW GENERATION
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIN AUSTRALIA
\h\hTHAT WANTS TO GO BACK
TO GENRE AND REINVENT IT.
\hDirector:
AND ACTION!
THERE‘S ALL THIS ACTIVITY
\h\h\h\h\hALL OF A SUDDEN
AND THAT‘S COMPLETELY
\hDUE TO "WOLF CREEK."
\h\hWHAT DO YOU
ACTUALLY DO NOW?
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI COULD TELL YA,
BUT THEN I‘D HAVE TO KILL YA.
PLEASE!
\h\h\h\h\h\hGreg McLean:
THE FILM WAS TURNED DOWN
\h\h\h\hBY LOTS OF PEOPLE
FOR STUPID REASONS.
\hIT‘S TO DO WITH NOT
WANTING TO BE RISKY.
\h\h\h\h\h\hFOR HORROR,
IT‘S GOT TO BE EXTREME,
OTHERWISE IT‘S JUST GOING TO
\h\h\h\h\hFALL INTO THE WASH
OF THE MILLIONS OF HORROR
\h\hFILMS THAT COME ALONG.
THAT‘S NOT A KNIFE.
- THIS IS A KNIFE.
- NO!
\h\h\h\hMatthews:
WATCHING THAT FILM
\h\h\hGETTING MADE,
IT REMINDED ME VERY MUCH
OF THE FILMMAKING ENERGY
\h\h\h\h\h\hOF THE ‘70s.
\h\h\h\hIT FELT LIKE
\hA LITTLE BIT OF A
NEW WAVE HAPPENING.
\h\h\h\h\hWITH FILMS LIKE
"WOLF CREEK" AND "UNDEAD"
AND FILMS LIKE THIS
\h\h\h\hBEING MADE,
\h\h\hI‘M HOPING
THAT IT LEADS TO
A SORT OF A LITTLE RENAISSANCE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOF GENRE FILMS.
\h\hTHESE FILMS
ARE COMING BACK.
( shrieks )
IN "STORM WARNING"
\h\hWE REALLY TRIED
TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
\hIN TERMS OF CONTENT
\h\h\hAND BRING IT BACK
TO KIND OF WHAT IT USED
\h\hTO BE A LITTLE BIT.
\h\hSigrid Thornton:
\h\h\hIT‘S A SIGN OF
TREMENDOUS MATURITY.
IT‘S A VERY VERY GOOD SIGN,
\hI THINK, FOR THE INDUSTRY
\hTHAT WE‘VE SORT OF COME
FULL CIRCLE, IF YOU LIKE.
\h\h\h\h\hTHE ENERGY LEVEL,
THE AUDACITY OF THESE FILMS,
\h\h\h\hI THINK SETS--
IN AN INTERESTING WAY,
SETS A VERY GOOD BENCHMARK
\h\h\hFOR FILMMAKERS NOW.
PEOPLE LIKE ME AND A LOT
\h\h\hOF OTHER DIRECTORS
ARE KIND OF SEEING THEM GOING,
\h"THAT‘S A HERITAGE WE HAVE."
I THINK I CAN SAY
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWITHOUT FEAR
OF SUCCESSFUL CONTRADICTION
THAT AMONG THE MANY FIELDS
\h\h\hOF ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR
IN WHICH WE AUSTRALIANS
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHAVE SHOWN
SUCH WONDERFUL
\h\hLEADERSHIP
IS THE ART OF THE
\hMOTION PICTURE.

\hWHEN I HAD THE SYDNEY
PREMIERE OF "KILL BILL,"
\hA GOOD SECTION
OF THE AUSTRALIAN
\h\hFILM INDUSTRY
WAS OUT IN THE AUDIENCE
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT NIGHT.
I KNEW THAT THEY‘RE SNOBS
AND I LIVE TO STICK A WEED
\h\h\hUP THE ASS OF SNOBS.
\h\h\h\hSO I DEDICATED IT
TO BRIAN TRENCHARD-SMITH.
IF YOU DON‘T LIKE BRIAN
\h\h\h\hTRENCHARD-SMITH,
\h\hYOU AIN‘T GOING
TO LIKE THIS MOVIE,
SO GET THE FUCK OUT
\h\h\h\h\hRIGHT NOW.
I‘VE JUST WARNED YOU.
\h\hIF YOU READ
AUSTRALIAN FILM,
YOU KNOW, LITERATURE
\h\h\hAND ANALYSIS,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI AM A SORT OF
A GUILTY PLEASURE FOOTNOTE.
\h\h\hTHE POWERS THAT BE
WOULD BEGRUDGINGLY AGREE
THAT I‘M A HALF-DECENT
\h\h\h\h\h\hCRAFTSMAN
\h\h\h\hAND I DOUBT THAT
IT‘S MORE THAN THAT NOW.
\h\hTHERE‘S NO QUESTION THAT
THE LIKE OF RICHARD FRANKLIN
\h\h\h\h\h\hAND JOHN LAMOND
WERE VERY VERY UNDERVALUED.
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,
\h\h\h\hTHE ONLY TIME
I MET THEIR LIKE
\h\hWAS WHEN I FIRST MET
SCORSESE AND SPIELBERG.
\h\h\h\hI STILL HAVE
A NEWSPAPER CLIPPING
OF JOHN IN HIS RAINCOAT
\h\h\hOUTSIDE A SEX SHOP
\h\h\h\h\hIN MELBOURNE.
\h\h\hI PRIZE THAT.
IT‘S VERY MUCH JOHN.
\hIT WAS GREAT FUN,
AND I‘D DO IT AGAIN.
\h\h\h\h\h\hI WILL DO IT AGAIN
IF SOMEONE PUTS UP THE MONEY.
I WILL MAKE EPICS
\hON A SHOESTRING
\h\h\h\hAND BE GLAD
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
I LOVED WORKING
\h\hWITH BRIAN.
EVERYTHING HE DID WAS BIG
\h\h\h\hAND MORE EXCITING.
\hMOVIE MAKING
WAS HIS FORTE.
\h\hAND WHETHER THE REST
OF THE INDUSTRY THOUGHT
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHOSE FILMS
WERE OF A CALIBER
\hTHAT WAS WORTHY
OF THE NEW AUSTRALIAN
\h\h\h\hFILM INDUSTRY
\h\hREALLY ISN‘T IMPORTANT.
IN HINDSIGHT, THEY ALL WERE.
- IT WAS AN ADVENTURE.
- IT WAS LIKE THE WILD WEST.
\h\h\h\hIT WAS JUST
COMPLETELY THRILLING
\hTO BE PART OF IT.
IT DID NURTURE YOU
\h\h\hFOR A FUTURE
IN A BIGGER, BETTER,
\h\hBRIGHTER WORLD.
I‘D ULTIMATELY LIKE
TO BE SORT OF VIEWED
AS THE SORT OF
\h\hA LONE GUN
\h\h\h\h\h\hRIDING OUT THERE
AT THE EDGE OF THE PRAIRIE,
\h\h\hMAYBE A LITTLE BIT
LIKE SORT OF JOHN WAYNE
\h\h\h\h\hWALKING OUT THE DOOR
AT THE END OF "THE SEARCHERS,"
KNOWING THAT YOU‘RE
\hPROBABLY ARE NEVER
\h\hGOING TO BE INVITED
TO STAY IN BY THE FIRE,
- BUT THAT‘S OKAY.
- GIVE ME A BREAK.
\h\h\h\hGO HOME,
TAKE YOUR MONEY,
RETIRE, GET OUT OF MY LIFE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI HATE YOU.
THE TOORAK DRIVE-IN
ON FRIDAY NIGHT WAS
\hYOUR LITMUS TEST.
DOESN‘T MATTER A RAT‘S ASS
\hWHETHER THE CRITIC LIKED
\h\h\h\h\hIT ON THURSDAY,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIF YOU DRIVE
OVER THAT TOP OF THE HILL
AND YOU SEE THE CARS
\hAROUND THE CORNER
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU THINK,
"SHIT, WE‘VE GOT A FILM."
YOU‘LL GET ANOTHER FILM.
\h\hAND I DIDN‘T DO IT
TO GET A BIGGER HOUSE.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI DID IT
TO MAKE ANOTHER FILM.
IT‘S A STRANGE INDUSTRY,
\h\h\hTHE FILM INDUSTRY.
\h\h\h\hMASTERPIECES
ROTTING IN DRAWERS,
\h\hMEDIOCRITIES
WINNING OSCARS.
C‘EST LA VIE.
THAT‘S AN AUSTRALIAN TERM.
Narrator: Before leaving,
\h\h\h\hreplace the speaker
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hon its stand,
\h\hthen drive forward
and move to your left.
Thanks, everyone.
\h\h\hWe trust you have
a very pleasant evening.
