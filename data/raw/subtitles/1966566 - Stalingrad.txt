Stalingrad (2013)
March 11, 2011
We go now live to an address by the
Prime Minister of Japan
The devastating news of the earthquake which struck 
the Tōhoku region has left the country deeply shaken.
The total number of casualties is growing by the minute...
...so for now we can only speculate
as to the scale of this tragedy.
We're deeply moved by the bravery of our people
and their courage in the wake of such adversity
I want to express my deep gratitude to the
international community of relief workers
for their participation in the rescue operations
which is a very dangerous job,
and we admire their bravery and commitment.
I sincerely hope that we will 
continue to work together as a community,
as it is the only way to move past
the heartache of this difficult time.
I pray for the salvation of the victims.
Because of you, we will rebuild Japan
and continue forward...
The number of victims, roughly?
- In our area, about 8,000.
It's a very bad situation.
Can get worse at any time.
The building's struts are too weak
they're just barely holding.
We have 28 alive.
According to eyewitnesses, there are five
in the immediate area of the restaurant.
Two girls and three young men.
All of them are German.
They've been out here.  Clinging to life,
underneath the rubble.
We cleared a path, and we attached this 
microphone to the remote-camera.
We'll try to get this down to their level...
We just now did that,
I think that all five are alive.
They are trapped no more than 30cm
under the concrete panel
It's very dangerous, because this could
all collapse at any moment.
Remain calm, kids.
I am a doctor.
Try not to speak.
It uses up too much oxygen.
On my signal, I need one of you
to briefly describe the situation.
So... who will speak?
- I'm Nina.
Can you hear me?  There's five 
of us down here.
We... We're all alive.
Okay, kids.
Now let's do this...
Just try to lay quietly
to conserve oxygen.
We can talk further once we get
you all out of there.
No, don't go!
Talk to us. Please!
Where're we going to go? 
The Metro is out of service.
Does anyone at home know that you're here?
Your Mom, Dad?
Yes, my mom knows.
My father died.
I miss him!
Nina, Nina, please don't cry!
It uses up oxygen.
I had five fathers.
And they all died. Died.
But I'm not crying, see?
Five fathers? That's impossible.
but it is... it is possible...
As some of you know. Anything is possible...
<b>STALINGRAD</b>
Directed by Fedor Bondarchuk
Lord! They walk on water.
Well, yes. They're the apostles.
Shut up, asshole!
More nonsense coming from your smart mouth.
They'll hear us.
- Don't be crotchety, old man.
The reconnaissance engineers cross at night, 
so they're invisible to planes in the air.
God is with us now.
Get the paddles, comrades.
This was in Stalingrad.
In the autumn of the year 1942.
The Russians crossed the Volga
determined to help those on the other side
And to prevent the Germans from
taking the city and crossing the river.
It was a nearly impossible task,
but they did not think about it.
Each soldier fought the best he could
but they didn't realize that they
were participating in the bloodiest battle
in the history of mankind.
Jesus, don't fucking do that
The reconnaissance scouts are back.
Jump.
You go to repair the equipment.
Right. Jump.
Sit.
Did you find a way through?
Mined?
You didn't try?
What the fuck?!
In the factory we found a deaf-mute.
Retarded.
Listen. In Russia, there is no such
thing as retarded. Only mentally ill
No retards. Good...
Wait for the assault group.
Take them to the refinery.
And hurry up.
Come on!
Here we are, here is the building.
We'll enter quietly.
And then, it all depends on luck.
Heads or tails.
Now, bring grenades
They'll be on the 2nd floor, no higher.
There is good visibility
and there is no reason to be up there
since flying shrapnel and everything else.
Second thing: before entering, 
toss your grenades and kill everything.
Cut each wire you find.
That's it. Come on!
Jürgens. Jürgens!
Russians.
- What?
Go and tell the staff.
- We have no power, Captain.
Jürgens, no wonder we don't have backup!
Go and fill the tanks with fuel!
But that's the fuel supplies for
the whole army, Captain.
Jürgens, you're a fucking idiot.
The Russians are coming!
Grenade!
Here's where they put it!
And God is with us. Come on, son.
Oh, you. My dear...
Be careful.
I'm going up.
Comrade, oh stupid me
What a stupid fucking punishment...
Get me my radio set
comrade, comrade...
Here it is!
Yesterday morning we went
to the bombed out tower...
And here - Germans killed my radioman.
Do you have recon scouts?
We have recon scouts,
Hey, why were you hanging up like that?
I have already said - Punishment for 
neglectful conduct
unbecoming of an officer.
- An officer?
...is shot for cowardice.
- You know the Germans, they hang officers
like an ornament on the Chrismas tree, eh?
- I hadn't slept for three days.
So, I admit it, I fell asleep.
Sleepyhead, you bastard!
Because of you, a division burned alive.
There was no artillery support,
And you were sleeping?!
Commander!
- What do you want?
Semjonova was killed,
and his radio was destroyed
Maybe you can continue this later?
Do you know how to operate the radio?
- Yes, I know how.
Secure the connection with HQ.
- Fuse.
Just tell me the frequency and call sign.
- Call sign is "Kaluga".
Forty-four-three.
You chicken-shit!
I'm not a chicken-shit. I am an officer
in the The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
Give me back my gun, please.
- Secure connection.
If you do not get a secure connection...
I'll kill you.
Captain, come here, quick!
He's got a boy hostage
It's over, man!
Girl!
Oh God, it's a
girl, Commander.
A bit shell-shocked. God forbid,
possibly a bit cracky
We'll deal with it in a bit
How are you, Nikiforov?
What do you know, we have company.
Yes- and who the hell are you?
Hell? I'm not the devil, Comrade Captain.
I'm an angel.
Artillery Commander, Sergeant Poliakoff.
Tank Artillery?
- Exactly.
Where's your gun, Commander?
- right out there.
Hmm, so... A shell?
- Yep
Use, against an artillery.
Clearly...
Of course - we will still fight.
Comrade Captain... Comrade Captain!
Division headquarters on-line.
- Sit down.
Now let's see, are you ok?
- Damn, it only matters if we're ok
Wait, Commander. Can not you see
What the Germans did to her?
So many have died in this war,
If she's alive, she's fine.
And so they met...
Here were five men, hardened
in two years of fighting,
In big cities and remote towns
of the vast country,
passed by the winds and scattered
along major rivers in the city.
were five men and my mom.
My young mother.
The building where my mama lived was
completely sealed off but for one exit on the Volga.
For the past few months
Our side won the building,
but in a moment it was lost again.
Mama got tired of life
in a fiery hell,
got tired of horror and
human misery, human malice
tired of their suffering.
Mama was just living
in the old house
and didn't want to leave her home.
Here was her room, her apartment,
her stairs, her street.
And further on - her town
to simply leave it all...
she just could not.
In those days mama was
nineteen years old...
What do we have here?
Fontana.
Three hundred meters to her.
No one will miss Chvanov.
Nothing can hide from the Tswana.
Ha, the disabled tank hiding
behind the walls of the store.
The Germans...
Techniques.
- Shit.
That won't work. He can not shoot.
Nice nest,
shitty woodpeckers.
Tswana!
- A?
Go there. Check
on the guys there.
Fool. What did he do there?
Apartment #8, where my Mom's neighbor
an engineer Sazonov, used to live.
a collector and fan of
butterflies and insects,
caretaker of the building, Gromov
made the observation.
Keep building three days.
While the main force
do not move to your bank. Got it?
I understand, Comrade Forth.
- What do not you understand, other?
Like something you did not understand!
- I did not understand how to carry out that order...
You're a trained soldier,
Spoken like a mobilized student.
I'll solve both. Is that clear?
- Yes, Comrade Forth.
Done!
Hold it! What are you doing here?
Stop. Stop, stop!
Do not be afraid;
I need you.
You should not be here, he'll kill you.
Come on, go.
This is my house, not yours.
- Yours?
Do we have your permission to stay?
- It's fine. You can stay, for now.
Give me the canteen to get water.
And that night the garrison
in the building increased.
All that had survived, 
instinctively came to the building.
On the first floor there were
sailors from the Volga Fleet
and volunteer workers from the submarine
factory and several engineering units.
They settled in an apartment #6
The Kuljikov family with many children
had lived in it peacefully.
Now there was a machine gun.
It works, fascist creep!
Girl, come here, I'll let you
shoot at the Germans.
Joke, joke!
Hand me your canteen.
You want them back?
On, on- take it!
Blessed... and looks
feeble-minded.
You need to take and use her
I'd like that...
What the?
you don't get a joke?
What do you do,
Ask a girl what it's called!
You... What is your name?
Katya.
Give your canteen.
So, citizen tenants!
The first floor is yours.
Go there and find him.
Do not show it,
Do not shoot without command.
Germans aside,
the body will start to stink.
What you left off.
The arms and legs through the window!
Who's in charge here?
- I am.
Chief Sergeant Krasnov.
And you?
I am the building manager.
Hello.
- Hi.
Soldier. Another...
And this officer.
Apparently, poor Jürgens.
What's the matter, Kahn?
Your people are thrown out the window
and you are in front of me alive and healthy?
You want to throw me
through the window, Colonel?
I want to know why are there
Russians in that damn building?
I had orders to keep the building.
I was supposed to blow up fuel in case of an attack.
Kahn, do you want to know the difference 
between the German officer and other officers?
He does not discuss the orders.
He executes them.
That is why the Wehrmacht
is now on the Volga.
And is soon to be
on the border with India.
But do not be afraid, Kahn.
You won't have to ride on an elephant.
Damnit!  Lice!
The whole army is scratching
like monkeys in a zoo.
Russians add ashes to their washing powder.
Ashes? In the powder!
Barbarians!
Kahn, tomorrow that
damn building will be ours.
You gave it to the Russians,
You will get it back.
Ashes in powder,
you bastards died out!
So... they throw
our soldiers through the windows?
Let me teach them a lesson!
Next.
Oh, officer!
From mangy sheep sackful of wool.
Hold it! Hold it!
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!
Hands in the air!
- Put them up!
How to raise them, when they are busy?
- Who are you?
Locals.
- You live in this building?
No, next to the pier.
What are you doing here?
Check the basket.
Come on!
Country
Clay and sand.
Country.
- We came to the river.
I always come here to the river.
Why?
- We take the grain from the coast
The Germans bombed
the grain, and we get it
Sift the grain, dried it
and cook porridge for children.
Sand is gritty to the teeth
but it does not matter, it can be eaten.
Here we go.
- There are the Germans.
So what?
- You're crazy, it's behind the front lines!
You're crazy! Maybe tomorrow the frontline
will be on the river. Will you run, then, or what?
We did not surrender the city to the Germans,
We live in it.  It lives in us!
Captain, let's kill him!
I can't hear that. - I'll kill you!
Close your mouth!
- Make me!
All right.
You hear Ana?
Do not look!
The water is cold.
- Do not twist.
Do not twist.
There you go.
Heil!
Ashes?
- With ashes, ashes.
Do not open your eyes, Darja.
- Turn around.
Raja, come here!
Lord, you've arrived.
You've been gone for a week.
I was hoping you weren't killed.
I see others eat what
I bring to you.
Do you alone give it...
Or do they take it by force?
Watch.
That's my wife.
When I saw you, I was amazed
how much you looked like her.
She died. My Christina.
Tuberculosis.
Who is this?
- My wife.
Frau.
- Female.
Frau. Women.
Mine.
It's my time.
This food is for you.
Do you understand?
Just for you!
I'll be back.
I appeal to everyone :
If anyone took the food from
the girls, I will personally kill him.
Automat-, clearly. Bomb...
One. Four.
So, so. Listen to me.
It's a city.
It is a transition.
This is our building.
If we let the Germans here
will again ignite the transition.
It's the perfect place to fire.
Therefore, we must not let them in here.
Is that clear?
There aren't many cartridges.
We have a German machine gun.
Four belts.
Three.
- Three.
It will be an hour of battle.
The artillery, everything is set.
- Artillery is ready.
Something else. Know their location.
Spread out.
It will soon begin.
- Wait a minute, Captain.
will deploy.
But what are we doing here?
We will defend this building
because there is an order to do so
Whose orders?
Orders Staff Division.
- Well, thats a different story.
You, your staff orders, Execute!
And I want to know my staff.
Sorry, we were alone
deployed on that coast.
Nikiforov, Volga sailors!
- What!
Please no
I used to
- Why?
I did not have a boat.
Commander, come to the Square...
come on...
What is this circus?
The people are assembled, Colonel.
Ask if she's Jewish.
Are you a Jew?
- How could we be Jews?
We've never even had a Jewish family
in the neighborhood.
Let me go. Let go, please!
Why are you all quiet?
Let go of me and my daughter!
Look, there they are.
We will burn them alive,
Comrade Captain!
Let the girl go!
She is not Jewish, this child is!
Do you see the officers?
- I see.
Will you hit him?
- How, hiding behind children, bastards!
What are you doing for God's sake!
Colonel, what orders were given
for the attack on the building?
I will answer you, Kahn.
Although it's not required by the rules.
I know the rules, Colonel.
- I doubt it.
But in this war they're forgotten,
we are back to our primal selves.
For example, the ancient Germans
made sacrifices to the gods before the battle.
Go with the soldiers.  The order
to attack will be given soon.
Or do you want to watch
our sacrifice?
No.
Everything is fine. Do not be afraid.
Now someone will come to help us.
There you are, you bastard!
- Why won't you sit down?
Do something.
There's a woman with a child.
You better shoot them, otherwise they will
burn, and suffer horribly!
Commander, get it.
- It's right, shoot!
They're going to shoot the children?!
Motherfuckers!
Give me the gun.
Lord have mercy!
Deliver us from this torment.
Burn in hell, you bastards!
Go!
- Shoot the bastards!
Shoot them! Shoot them all now!
Go! Go!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Mine!
Heil!
What are you doing?
Some of them drowned...
Like rats coming out of the wood-work.
You, blue. You, you.
Come quickly!
It's gonna hurt for a second.
Does it hurt?
It's nothing. It's fine.
Sasha.
Alexander Nikiforov.
Yes, I know your name.
With my mom I often went to
your concerts before the war.
I know all your songs.
And arias.
Mom loved you.
And my sister.
Your portrait
hung on our walls.
Nikiforov!
Commander wants you.
Sasha!
If I ask you,
Will you sing?
Who, he can sing? He has spoken
once in six months.
I did about it
I do not know anything?
Come on.
Alexander Nikiforov.
Tenor.
You called me, Comrade Captain?
- Come here.
Do you see the plane?
Do you see the plane?
This is a "Henkel".  Bombed the
bastard trying to cross.
There are two machine guns
and a third, smaller, with midfielder.
Nikiforov, help the engineers.
Come on. Take the gun and instruments.
Wrap them in a cloth, and don't rattle
them around.
I am an engineer, not a mechanic.
- Come on, go!
Are you okay?
14 Germans dead.
We lost six.
We did.
Do you have a cigarette?
May I go sir?
- Yeah, go ahead.
By the time he was fourteen
years old, Sanja Nikiforov
knew that he was different then
the other boys.
He felt the weight of fate upon
his shoulders to be a soldier
but found work at the founderies,
and tractor factories
that had then existed, throughout  
the center of Stalingrad
Then in his 16th year Sanja appeared
to be a crystal clear tenor, and
on the recommendation of the factory Komsomol
he went to the Moscow Conservatory.
Before the war, he sung with
the Philharmonic as a soloist,
and immediately became a big
city star.
In first days of the war Nikiforov
became a volunteer.
Twenty days he wandered
through the bodies and a wasteland
in the Belorussian forests
until he was caught.
For twenty days he was interrogated
in a military camp.
These dreadful first months of the war
made him cold, with a
closed-heart, even cruel.
Look at these filthy animals.
Peter Kahn, awareded the
Order of the Iron Cross.
From the noble Prussian family.
Generalfeldmarschall Paulus
invited me to lunch.
He called me a hero.
Hero!
SS you can not fight.
You have no idea of honor.
The bandits who shoot back.
Do not fight for victory
but for the sake of revenge.
I came here as a soldier.
You've turned me into an animal
Well, in general and on the whole?
Are we going to learn to shoot?
Haven't you wanted to?
Why only gestures.
Say it with words.
I want.
- A desire, two desires.
Three, I want to squeeze.
You've been here with the Germans.
And not talking about anything.
That's not good.
Not good,
and in general as a whole.
What man.
As they say, a real spit.
Filthy mouth. Too dirty.
Galya, do not listen to him. Don't listen.
What are you looking at?
Want to know how
We lived under the Germans?
What were they doing to us?
How I stayed alive?
Why am I not in the pit with my mom and dad?
Why didn't I kill them?
Ask, do not hesitate.
Come on!
Go ahead, ask.
Do you want details?
Our protectors!
I myself couldn't
I was afraid. I waited for you to...
Shoot.
Come on. What are you waiting for?
I'll kill him!
- Damn. Sit down!
Sit down I say!
Forget what you heard!
Poles, go calm the girl.
Mine.
And one more thing.
I have a beautiful wife.
I took her from her village...
...because of her beauty.
The village was far away, in Lipetsk.
We began to live. We lived well.
I was worried about her.
Beautiful scarf she picked-out,
boots of felt...
She loved to caress my head.
I get home, I sit down beside her,
She laid her head on her knees.
I was petting...
Her hair long and black.
Before New Year's Day 1939
she gave birth to our daughter.
You'd think I look like a grandfather, eh?
And my daughter was born.
I want to sleep.
Can I?
I'm just a little.
I'm tired.
The wife and daughter
of Basil Poljak
had been dead for almost a year.
They lived in Moscow
the Red Square,
where Poliakoff had two rooms on Metrostroja Rd.
they were killed during the terrible
bombings of October 1941.
They didn't make it to the air-raid shelter
because they helped a woman with a stroller.
The woman and the baby survived.
The woman was young, Polish
Twenty-six years old.
While asleep in his lap now was
the kindest person on Earth...
...my mom.
You're soul is clean,
Do not be afraid of any-thing.
Masha - fascist nose.
Masha - fascist nose.
Did you wash?
Peeeew, Peeeew... you will not wash!
Go away from me!
Are you going to get water?
Here's your water!
What do you want?
You promised to teach me to shoot.
Teach me!
Lie down next to me, I'll teach you.
The butt of the shoulder,
Toes here.
I know how to hold a gun.
Teach me to shoot the target.
Find your target, get it in the crosshairs,
and then shoot.
Who is this?
Who, who, woman.
- She's beautiful.
It's nice.
I've seen her many times
In the basement there's a German
who goes... Maybe with her.
Shoot her.
Fool.
German.
No really, a German.
You're lucky,
first time and running into a German.
Now look...
You need to see this.
Head - chest, head - chest.
Skinny. With glasses.
He walks like a goose.
He's still young.
- Do not look at where he is, 
  but where he will be
Follow him!
Shoot him.
- Stop!
She got it.
On the first shot! Bravo.
What did you do, motherfucker?
- What is it, Commander?
You killed the soldier who was coming for water.
- He's a fascist, not a soldier.
Not even animals fuck with each other
at the watering hole!
Do you know the verse, Comrade Captain?
"How many times you see it,
so many times and kill him. "
I do not care whether you go
drinking, eating and shitting.
I have killed and will kill them.
My mother wrote to me that
they killed my little brother.
Just because his name 
was Vladimir Ilyich.
He was seven years old.
And what did the soldiers do?
Stop it! I killed him!
Get out, so we'll see you again
The mother of Mise Tswana
did not write that. She couldn't have
Back at their home in Gomel,
the SS had raped her and 
threw her into the barn to die.
His beautiful older sister
was wounded in the arm
and was nearly burned alive in the house.
She fled to the partisans.
There they amputated her wounded arm
which had gotten gangrene.
Good thing she was left-handed, because 
in the letter he didn't notice anything.
Well, look at you, you look like
a completely normal woman.
Like a German, or a French woman.
As if you didn't want to put a
knife in my back, if I turned around.
But we both know the truth.
- Not a word, I don't understand.
Grab anything useful
and take to the streets.
Heil!
Colonel,
We found a German officer.
It's a spectacle.
A German soldier in the basement
with a dirty Russian whore.
It was at this time that the Fuhrer's army
trying to keep the banks of the Volga.
Shining example for others.
There's no excuse, Captain.
Yes, I've tried .. but
still I can find no words.
What exactly is your excuse?
Yep, I thought so.
Colonel, permit me to speak.
- No I will not.
Headquarters has ordered us
to “clean” the combat zone...
...of all the dirt and filth.
What do you think Kahn...
Is this dirt or trash?
Well, I can understand.
You aren't conquered by this Russian
fortress, but by ... a smaller box.
But you want to have dignity, don't you?
I can understand you as a person,
To be an officer is what you don't get.
Petty Officer!
Get rid of the women who're currently washing our clothes
- Yes, Colonel!
Get new ones who are older and uglier.
We must somehow get rid of these damn lice.
Get up, go to the rear with Nikiforov.
- I'm not going!
Leave.
- Hey, you!
That's nice, while you're here,
guys will not rest.
They aren't fighting for the Motherland 
or Stalin, they are fighting for you!
You're not doing it right!
- Why not?
Then get dressed yourself already!
Because I'm not going to sacrifice you, it's crazy.
Our Motherland will not kill you,
She is great.
And you... I can not protect you.
You will kill
and they will break.
And you, you fight for me?
I will not give up.
I want to fight with you,
to kill Germans, to shoot them.
Listen, you're not even sixteen,
you're a child!
My passport.
Yes. Right. Fifteen...
It's your birthday!
Yes but I look eighteen
I can be mobilized.
You look nineteen...
Congratulations.
So...
- Let me, Captain.
You understand?
I understand why wouldn't
I understand?
Stop it.
Hush, hush, can you hear me?
I said, softly!
Can you hear me? Do not play games, chicken.
That's not good, right?
She's not your wife, you understand?
Do you understand me?
Get some rest.
God, look at that display!
Towards the head of the bridge.
We can't do anything here.
- Damn, can you...
turn your guns so that the river is behind us?
It's dangerous, but we can try it.
In the water! In the water!
Diiiii!
I'll hit them.
Our artillery.
Nonsense, there's no way to shoot
in the form of a "G"
Shot. It's my shot.
Where are you taking these people?
- At the station, Captain.
Why?
- Load them in wagons.
Masha!
Masha!
Masha!
Mr. Captain, this is the
mail post delivery cycle!
The engine belongs to
German Army, idiot.
Swine, get out of the way!
Sit.
You shut up, Tswana.
Lieutenant Astakhov is educated,
he graduated from the Institute.
Not ignorant like you.
Rustic peasant.
That's a great thing, the Institute.
But learning to shoot is another.
Don't be scared
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Chief, we've only got one shell.
But, give the orders, and...
He will hit.
Wait a minute.
Take a look.
I see the target. The dome of the tank.
The lower left corner.
The angle looks correct.
Well, shoot!
Perhaps God was looking down on us...
Damn!
In Stalingrad, we shoot
and destroy tanks!
Sergei Astakhov attended The
Artillery Institute straight out of school.
In the city of Podoljsk, where
he was born and raised.
In October of 1941, one year ago
he and the other cadets
defended the small town of
Jaroslavec for several days.
He was the only survivor of
his entire company.
No one could look at him
and say they saw cowardice
But with the girls, he was shy.
Kahn! Are you crazy?
We were evacuating your building.
You did not say that there was artillery.
You seduced a Russian whore
and you were AWOL.
Where were you? Answer!
I will execute that bitch!
She turned my best officers 
into brainless idiots.
And you, and you will be shot!
- As you wish.
But first I'm going to occupy that building.
And she'll wait for me here.
Kahn, if you do not get that
building, I will punish you.
I know.
Colonel!
All the residents of the building, 
whose memory history recorded
since childhood, all relatives,
friends, neighbors... died.
before her eyes
As mom lived it all, how she lived alone, 
I can not say.
and it is rarely talked about,
the events of the first months of the war.
Many times I've listened to her story
about the quiet life of the building.
and imagined all
its inhabitants.
and knew about her neighbor,
Uncle Misha Sazonov,
and Mitya and Lenocka Kuljikove,
her friends from the first floor
and Aunt Hasina Joseph
giving enticing music lessons -
but all were killed
in the August bombing.
and neighbors were buried
amidst the ruins of the building,
because it was impossible
to get to the city cemetery.
Later graves appeared
When the Germans occupied the building.
Nikiforov, let me go.
Be a man.
I need to find a gift.
For Katya. For her birthday.
Are you happy?
and Mama finally shoveling
the burnt land, itself.
and therefore 14 people, adults and children,
were layed in very shallow graves
and they were covered with stones.
Sister and mother,
My grandmother and aunt,
her mama is buried at the end
It's here somewhere.
Here it is. Here, here.
Think about it, no water, the
bathroom was destroyed by shell.
The poor thing was half a year
was difficult washing. Cold water.
Be happy.
Krasnov...
Shut the fuck up.
- NCO Sojman, Hauptmann.
How can I help?
- Do you have a cigarette?
One moment, Hauptmann.
Here you are.
What was destroyed?
- Everything.
Cannon?
- No cannon. The shutter valve failed.
Why aren't you fixing it?
- There are no spare parts.
I do not care if the tank drives or not
But I need the cannon.
If you can't do it, I'll kick you out
onto street and order you to storm the building.
Certain execution!
Grovel? Motherfucker
The Navy does not crawl!
I've got it!
See that, there is the tank.
can't you give it to me for
to give to Katya for her birthday?
All right. First torpedoes ready?
- Ready.
Second torpedoes ready?
Get up!
Flexed his muscles.
Attention. Attention!
You're ready?
- Yes, Hauptmann.
What's it say on the buckle?
Faster!
- God is with us.
God is with us...
Where there is God, there is 
our Führer, Adolf Hitler.
And where Hitler is, there is Germany.
Germany is here with us
in this place.
I'll ask: What do we need to do
to just take the damn building?
I listen to you?
- No, sir, Captain!
Behind this house is the Volga.
Behind this house is the end of the war.
Behind this building is India.
And in India, all whores have six arms.
Just imagine what they can
do with their six arms.
Maybe some of you
do not wish to go to India?
You have 15 minutes.
That's it.
Attention!
Shit, get up!
I said go!
Katya, you're with him on the second floor.
If something happens you scream, right?
Angel, get out.
Be careful out there!
Chvanov, Nikiforov, in the corner.
I will be in the center.
Come on.
Remember?
After the bombing, when they enter...
Cover up.
Where are you going? Hold it!
Hold it!
Not so fast, Captain.
Cover me, Tswana.
Do you know what you are, Kahn?
You are a disgrace to the entire Wehrmacht!
I'm going to the division headquarters.
You still have time.
I hope that you will use it.
Captain!
- What?
You are needed above.
At the right time. It is easy to die.
My comrade soldier.
Where's Katya?
- In your room.
I'm going to dig their graves.
I will not go. I'm not going anywhere!
Please let me go!
Fire!
What's going on? Why aren't you shooting?
The mechanism is again stuck,
Captain.
Shit!
Here was Captain Gromov
the immortal hero,
he was like a lion,
He had survived the
Battles of Khalkhyn Gol.
He had neither relatives, nor family, 
nor a home to return to.
He was wounded three times.
According to the doctors, once
he was even killed.
Bleeding.
- Where?
I think it's just from the debris.
Glass.
Slowly, slowly...
Listen. Go here.
Please. Go.
Do you hear? I beg of you!
So what?
- I hear you.
I will not go anywhere
Berber was the first
to which it is bound.
A mother - the only woman
with which so long.
God, why me?
For what sins?
How can I ever repay you?
Will I ever be again
at peace with this woman?
stroking her hair.
I do not understand you, Petya.
In Russian: "Piotr."
You are Petya.
Petiya.
- Not Petija.
But Petya.
Petya.
- Petya.
The funny sounds all you Russians
make:  -Masa...
Petya, Volga - Bul Bul.
Love?
You know what that word means?
I love you.
Libe.
It will either be, or won't...
Would kill me yours,
or ours.
Now I do not care.
- Sverazno.
Anyway.
- Whatever.
any...
- Whatever. I love you
Anyway.
Get out of the way.
Here's a gift.
Thank you.
- Smell it.
Beautiful...
Duni.
So what? To drink?
Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.
So... Help yourself.
And now, let's for a solemn part!
Our own Alexander Nikiforov will
sing romances and arias from the opera.
Look at him!
- Quite the instrument.
What should I do?
What should I do...
Tell me German,
What should I do?
Damn this war!
Damn country,
damn building!
Thank you, Sasha.
- And now, here's your present.
it's from all of us.
Come on! Come on!
Guys, it's girl time...
We're going down.
Let me see.
It turned out that he was wearing a tie
in his pocket throughout the war.
It's funny and all, and furthermore, there is
naked woman up there, who we can't even see.
and we can still die.
You know what they say:
Behind the Volga there is no life.
Angels, is it something else?
That's it. Fighters to sleep!
The sky is clouded over.
Tomorrow I'll take that building.
At any cost.
And I will take you to safety.
In the vicinity of the fire tower...
Nobody goes there.
Neither us nor the Russians.
I'll hide you there one day.
Do you understand?
One day!
Serjoza. Do not go.
Thank you so much.
That looks horrible.
It's terrible, because it's pretty?
Yes.
I don't need it.
The war is.
Katya. The sky is clouded over.
Dress, please.
I need to show you something.
Outside...
The commander said it's okay...
Serjoza...
Serjoza, where are you taking me?
Now, now.
Have a seat.
Sit down!
It will now begin.
Watch.
This was my observation post.
Then the Germans discovered us.
They began an aggressive attack.
We decided to retreat
Retreat -...?
- Retreat, move
They were all caught.
Bitch!
Why are there are no Germans?
It is strange.
They're everywhere, but we can't see any
Really. It is really weird.
I didn't think about it before
I bet that this is the only building
throughout the city, with no one inside
Neither Germans nor our own.
But it'll be better, we will wait.
Wait for what?
Wait out the fear
Wait out the terror
Wait out the war
Wait out everything
Like the cloud.
Katya.
I love you.
Two days and I'm already in love.
I know.
Come on. Sit.
You will stay here.
Do not go anywhere.
I'll be back.
Nikiforov!
Where's Katya?
Where is Astahov? Find them.
Wait.
What is it?
Will you be back?
- Go there!
German whore!
Russians!
Colonel,
We caught a Russian spy.
Where did you get him? - Hauptmann Kahn
it is caught in a fire tower.
He killed three of our midfielders.
- Hauptmann Kahn? Miracle!
What do I do with this waste?
Kahn, what do we do with him?
Question him?
- Interrogate him?
Do you know Russian?
- I speak German.
Come on, Grandpa, get up,
you sit there?
Tell your people to bring me
food and water.
So what? Why are you all standing, a Russian officer
was on his knees in front of you, you freaks!
Where did you come from? From this building
or on the other side of the river.
I have a present for you.
- What?
I have a present for you.
From a Russian girl ... Katya.
What a crock of shit.
I can't feel anything.
Absolutely nothing.
No pain.
I'm not even itchy...
Damn you try as I ...
... am left ... alone.
Lieutenant Schmidt.
- Hauptmann Kahn. Do you have a cigarette?
Let's go to the passage, which made
Russians across the devil's Volga.
See that building.
The third floor right?
I see it.
My Russian friend is in
his nest up there,
Can you hit it with the tank?
Yes, the target is plain-as-day.
Then go on.
What is it?
- Nothing.
Just a noise. What is it
dreams, it is still early.
You need to go home.
You know, I immediately fell in love with you.
At first glance.
I knew immediately that I was in love.
- I love you.
Really?
Really.
- I have to go.
I can't go.
Yes go.
- No!
You'll wait here.
Is that clear?
All right.
Soon it will all be over.
Are you alive?
I'm alive. How are you?
It's nothing.
You... Go.
I'll wait for Nikiforov.
Go.
Here it is, comrade.
We will die in the orchestra.
Well, it's time to go to heaven.
Right, why not heaven?
In heaven!
I have a pass.
That's not the Rus.
Where's the other one?
Russians!
Russians!
Don, damn it.
Don. It's Gromov.
Stand up.
Shit, don't shoot!
Radio station.
Come on!
Don... Don, Don!
Here Don, I'm listening.
- Here "Kaluga".
Open fire.
Immediately. Coordinates:
Square 24, the length of
17 degrees, width 14
If you've heard this, do you copy?
"Kaluga", "Kaluga", did not understand.
These are the coordinates of the building,
where we are. Do you copy?
That's us. We saying it,
Open fire!
The Germans entered the building.
Now open fire!
Roger that. I understand you "Kaluga".
All is understood. Goodbye, boys...
That's it.
It will be.
Do you want to ask for Katya?
It's good. I hid her.
She said to thank you.
And she said...
... that she really liked you.
This was in Stalingrad.
In November of the year 1942
Next were terrible months of
bloody battle,
which were the end of a grand
era of mankind's history.
In the history of
my great country.
Mom wanted me to always remember
that we owe our lives and freedom to
the millions who died.
And even though she gave me the name of my
father - Sergey Astahova,
My mother had always said,
that I had five fathers.
Sergei?
Sergei Astakhov there.
Sergei, Sergei?
- Sergey Astakhov there.
Mama always said,
that I was lucky,
because I look like all of them.
And I am so grateful,
because thanks to my fathers
my five fathers...
I did not have to truely know war.
