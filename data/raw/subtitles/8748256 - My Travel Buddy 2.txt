It was a hard time
This memory got me down
Loneliness has struck me
Come to me whenever you want
My door is still open to you
My loneliness hits the moon
It reflects back on my wall
Sing it!
I’ll sing it.
...open to you
My loneliness hits the moon
It reflects back on my wall
Wake up, wake up my heart
Sing it!
I’ll sing it all.
Loved ones
Trains loaded with love
Ride along the empty rails
Those who make the lovers sad
Keep riding along the way
My door is still open to you
My loneliness hits the moon
It reflects back on my wall
Hands up!
Here! Here! Maraş ice cream!
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you.
Great! It’s hard as concrete.
Here! Maraş ice cream!
You’re great!
You’re wonderful, my brother.
I’ve tanned!
Look, I’m all red and white.
I look like a football fan
fresh out of a national game!
I think you look excellent.
Şeref, am I supposed to play
at a döner shop?
-What kind of prompter are you?
-Here, brother.
Look, you’re getting requests!
That’s great.
Okay, we have a request
from this gentleman. Let’s see.
Chef, two half loaves and two ayrans.
Onur! Onur!
I’ll deal with this. Leave it to me.
Where are you going?
Sir, here’s your order!
You say:
"I’m your promoter, leave it to me,"
then you attack the men
with ice cream!
I actually landed the first hit.
I have no idea how they grabbed
the ice cream and beat me up with it.
They hit you and applied cold therapy
at the same time!
-A complete beating!
-Right.
They gave you a good whipping
with the Maraş ice cream!
-Right.
-What shall we tell Selim?
I’ll deal with it. I’ve got that.
What’s that in your hand?
Oh, I actually came here for that.
You’re entering a contest!
-What contest?
-A singing contest.
-A singing contest?
-Yes.
They produce a single
for the winner.
And they make a video too!
And there’s a prize of 50,000 liras!
-For God’s sake, don’t be silly.
-But why?
Do I look like I can win a contest?
I play at a döner shop!
And I’ve just been fired from the place!
You can win it! Leave it to me.
Leave it to you? This is where
I ended up when I left things to you!
I left it to you, and here I am!
I don’t want to hear
the word "contest" again!
-Onur!
-Shut up! I’ve heard enough!
-Onur, listen to me.
-Şeref, I want to be left on my own.
Leave me alone.
I can’t take any more of your nonsense.
-Excuse me.
-Onur!
Şeref, I said eave me alone. Alone!
On my own. You understand? All alone.
Just me!
I’m going to be alone.
I’ve had enough. I need a rest.
Okay, you rest your head.
I’ll see you at home.
Tonight is an important night.
-What’s going on?
-Sit down.
So?
-Don’t tell me you forgot.
-Forgot what?
So you forgot about today. Great.
-What’s going on?
-Alright. Nothing.
-Is it your birthday?
-No.
-Is it my birthday?
-No.
-Is it our wedding anniversary or what?
-You’re close.
I’m close? Don’t be silly.
Today is our first anniversary
as road trip friends.
-What?
-Exactly on this day last year,
we set out on a road trip together.
But of course, you forgot.
You males, you’re all the same.
-And you?
-I’m not a male. I’m a proper man!
What on earth is
a "friendship anniversary" anyway?
-I’ve never even celebrated my birthday!
-You say that because it’s convenient!
Şeref, thank you.
You’ve prepared a nice surprise, but...
I’m really not in the mood.
And you did lots of silly things today.
Something else must have happened.
It’s all over your face.
-What happened?
-Nothing.
What is it? Tell me.
-My mother.
-Did she text you again?
-Exactly.
-What did she say?
What could she say?
She wants to meet me.
I’ve been turning her down for five years,
but she still wants to meet!
Onur...
Şeref, don’t tell me the same things,
for God’s sake.
"She’s your mother,"
"You must meet her," and so on.
Am I supposed to hug the woman
who left me all alone at the age of three?
You know why
I’ve never celebrated my birthday?
I was too embarrassed to invite
my friends, as I had no mother!
So let’s not talk about this.
I’m going down to the house.
Why don’t we sit together some more?
Happy anniversary.
But I’m really not in the mood.
Give me the key.
Give it to me.
Here.
Is this the anniversary cake?
-Yes.
-You could’ve waited a few minutes
before you dug that tunnel.
Come on.
I just tasted it while waiting for you.
-Be careful!
-Wait, I’ll take it.
Don’t touch it. I’ll take care of it.
-Come over here.
-Okay.
-I’ll wash my hands.
-Okay.
Go on.
The water is cut.
Onur, we really need to plan
for this contest now.
When are we leaving?
Where do we stay?
Şeref, Ahmet called me from my old job.
He said they’re hiring.
And I told him I’d come.
You can tell Selim.
I’m quitting the music business.
-Back to being a pharmaceutical rep.
-Why would you do that?
You’re earning your living
making music!
-Earning my living?
-Yes.
-So you think we’re doing fine now.
-Of course.
You’ve been winding me up
to "follow my dreams" for a year,
-and now I’m singing at a döner shop!
-What’s wrong with that?
Even Tarkan used to sing in weddings.
What was Tarkan singing? Tell me.
Was Tarkan singing wedding songs?
Stop talking nonsense.
Just look at this mess of a house!
Before I met you, I was living in
a three-plus-one apartment.
How many rooms here?
-One.
-Not even one. Zero!
We can barely stand next to each other!
The toilet is next to the bed!
When you go to the toilet at night,
you almost shit in my mouth!
I run the water
so you won’t hear the sound.
I still hear it!
Onur, this contest
will change both our lives.
As your promoter, I promise you. Trust me.
I don’t trust anybody anymore.
We used to have girlfriends.
What happened? Where are they now?
Mine left me and went abroad.
Yours doesn’t even answer your calls.
-Maybe she didn’t see them.
-For three months?
Please, accept it.
My shyness on the stage,
the stupid places you booked for me...
We failed.
So you really don’t want
to make music any longer?
I don’t.
I don’t want this silly costume...
that you force me to wear either.
And...
I don’t want this either.
Take this. Look at it, and think.
I’m going to my room.
I can’t even go to my room!
I can’t even make a good fuss
in this house!
Selim, we’ll pay back our debt!
We have some payments due.
We can’t get them.
We found the man who owes us.
We threatened him.
He said he owed someone else.
He didn’t pay us.
-Is that so?
-Yes!
So that’s what happened?
Right.
Let me see you enact that.
-Sorry?
-Act it out!
You’re the man asking for his money.
And you’re the man not paying.
Where did you speak to him about this?
In Beşiktaş. At the wharf.
You’re the ferry.
You’re the sea.
And you’re the seagull.
Act it out.
Good. Seagull, get in the action!
And you, act it out.
Why aren’t you paying your debt?
I owe other people.
I need some more time.
-I’ve got no more time for you.
-Then I’m not paying my debt.
What do you mean you’re not paying?
I owe a debt to Selim!
Why did you stop?
In this part...
-he did something bad.
-What did he do?
He swore at you.
-What did he say?
-I can’t say it.
What did he say? You tell me.
Sir...
-I won’t say it either
-Say it.
-He said: "Fuck Selim."
-Say it properly!
He said: "Fuck Selim!"
Mind your words!
Take them away and run them over!
And Nevzat, bring that swearing jerk here.
-Sir!
-We stand by our debt!
-We stand by our debt!
-We’ll pay it back!
Sir, Şeref is waiting outside.
Shall we let him in?
Hello, Selim.
Şeref.
Onur has a beautiful voice.
But he can’t fill the venues.
You know that, right?
Something is missing. We booked him
for the bar and it didn’t work out.
The club, it didn’t work out.
I got him to play at a döner shop
to gain some experience.
And you made a scene there
on the first day!
It’s not like you think.
I heard three guys made fun of him
while he was on the stage
and you attacked them
with Maraş ice cream!
Well, it is like you think.
Şeref, what am I supposed
to do with you guys?
I have an idea
to help Onur pick himself up.
-I’ll get him to enter a contest.
-What contest?
A singing contest.
They make a single for the winner.
And they produce the video too.
And then, what next?
The boy takes off!
And once he takes off,
he plays at your venues only!
-So?
-So...
I know I already owe you.
If you lend me 20,000 liras more,
I’ll pay you back
with interest in three days.
-What do you need 20,000 for?
-We have some expenses to cover.
But I’ll pay you back many times more!
And there’s a 50,000-lira prize!
Şeref, to this day, you haven’t kept
a single promise you’ve made me.
How am I supposed to trust you?
Nevzat told me the same thing
on the phone.
So I brought you this.
What’s that?
I’m giving you the deed for the land
my family left me as a guarantee.
-How much is that worth?
-Sixty- or seventy-thousand.
Why bring it to me? Go sell it.
I can’t. This is the last thing
I have from my family.
It has great sentimental value for me.
-Have you given your power of attorney?
-I’ve given it to Nevzat.
That was the first time
I’ve done this in my life.
It was very special for me.
I’ll give you the money for the sake
of that boy with a beautiful voice.
Thank you very much.
We’ll bring back the car in three days.
I promise.
What car?
Can we borrow one of the cars
at the döner shop?
We’ll need it for the tour.
Okay, Şeref, enough.
No car. Get out of here.
Okay.
Selim.
That land has a great sentimental value
for me.
You’ll take care of it, right?
Look, Şeref.
This is my grandfather’s jug.
Your grandfather’s jug?
It’s 150 years old.
My grandfather trusted it
to me before he died.
I’ve been taking care of it for 20 years.
It brings me luck.
I kiss my grandfather’s jug
every morning before I start work.
Right.
-So?
-So...
if I tell you I’ll take care of something,
I will.
Now get out of here.
-Okay.
-Come on, Şeref.
Okay.
-Nevzat.
-Yes, sir.
Take this deed to my father.
Tell him to take it
for this month’s rents.
Sir.
-He said he’d pay it back.
-Do what I say.
The rents are late this month.
I don’t want my father to make a fuss.
Okay, sir.
Hey, handsome!
I haven’t seen your face in three days.
What’s up?
What are you doing here?
-That car?
-I borrowed it from Selim for the contest.
I gave it a bit of a repair.
I’m going to an important job interview.
Please go away.
Stop playing hard. Get in the car.
I know you want to.
People will misjudge us. Go away.
Not before I persuade you
to enter the contest.
Şeref, look, I don’t belong on the stage.
You see? We have to accept this.
Your promoter has that covered too.
I booked a few venues before the contest.
You’ll get on the stage for some practice.
I’ve got that covered.
You’re slowing down the traffic. Move on!
I’ve never had a dream of my own.
Let me make an effort to help
my best friend realize his dream.
I even got the payment
for the first gig in advance!
Two-thousand liras.
-Two-thousand liras?
-Yes.
-Here.
-Okay, put it down.
I can no longer do without Onur
and you can’t do without Şeref.
Okay, those are nice words,
but I don’t trust myself.
And you, I don’t trust you at all!
I feel like if I said yes to you,
something bad would...
Onur!
-Are you alright?
-I’m very fine.
Why don’t you order two cups of tea?
Let’s enjoy some hot tea right here.
-Open it.
-There.
REPORT MY DRIVING
YILDIZ ORGANISATION
What happened?
My mother.
She sent a message on Instagram.
With a photo of us together.
Let me see.
You were so little.
People are little when they are babies,
Şeref.
Right. It’s a great photo.
It’s nice, but the problem is,
it’s our only photo together.
Onur, why won’t you meet your mother?
She told you a thousand times.
She wanted to divorce your father
because he cheated on her.
Your father didn’t let her see you.
He made her lose track of you.
And your mother was so sad,
she went to Belgium
and settled there with your aunt.
-She did the right thing, somehow.
-You shut up somehow, Şeref.
-I’m already in a bad mood.
-Okay, okay.
Don’t start sulking.
Look, we’re on a beautiful road trip.
-You’ll be famous in two days!
-Come on.
-Paparazzis will be chasing you.
-What’s that?
Just wait.
We found Onur Güzel in
the nights of İstanbul.
Onur, we’ve been seeing you
out at night so often.
-What will you say?
-Where did you find that?
-I bought it at the fuel station.
-You’re crazy.
So Onur, answer our question.
You were seen out with a woman
at the bar last night. Is she your lover?
We’re only friends.
Friends don’t do to friends
what you did last night!
-Ask me about my work!
-You did some good work last night!
I don’t want to comment on this.
Okay, so let’s get to the serious matters.
Onur, there’s a rumor that you haven’t
been seeing your mother in years.
-Are you thinking of meeting her?
-Okay, put it away.
-Onur, please answer the question.
-Put that thing away!
Unbelievable!
Onur Güzel attacked our cameras!
Shock, shock, shock!
Coming up next:
Onur Güzel attacks our cameras!
Enough! Turn that thing off!
I trusted you,
and you’re already acting silly.
Why wouldn’t you trust me?
We’re riding along sweetly.
Okay Şeref, enough.
You keep saying I’m not to be trusted.
I’m offended.
What can I do? I just don’t trust you.
If you keep talking like that,
I’ll jump off the car.
- Don’t be silly.
- Say: "You’re my brother. I trust you."
-Or I’ll jump off the car!
-You’re my brother...
but I don’t trust you.
Look.
Say: "You’re my brother. I trust you."
-I’ll really jump off the car!
-Şeref, close the door!
-Say it or I’ll jump!
-You’ll cause an accident.
-Say it or I’ll jump!
-Şeref, don’t be silly! Close the door.
-I’m about to jump!
-Şeref, that’s a horrible joke!
-There I go!
-Şeref, stop it!
Stop!
-Come here!
-Don’t worry, what could...
Şeref! Şeref!
-I told you, you were about to fall!
-Help me!
Pull me up!
Are you hurt?
My head is bleeding!
-I have blood phobia!
-Şeref!
Şeref! Get up, Şeref!
Just look at us.
And we’ve only just set off!
I fell down by accident.
Stop bearing down on me.
It’s my fault for going on a road trip
with you again!
-Is your head still bleeding?
-I don’t know. Take a look.
Why did you press my t-shirt
against your head?
That was a brand new t-shirt!
-Onur, don’t show me blood!
-Şeref, wait! Şeref, get up!
Get up! He’s not getting up...
Şeref, get up! Wake up!
Şeref, stop it! Şeref!
Onur!
We hit something! What was that? Wait.
-Oh no!
-Miss, are you hurt?
-Are you alright?
-Do I look alright?
Where on earth is this hospital?
Look at the mess we got in because of you!
-Are you alright?
-I’m fine.
-What’s your name?
-Çilek.
What sort of name is "Çilek"?
She must have lost her memory!
-What’s my name?
-I don’t know!
-She doesn’t remember my name.
-She doesn’t know your name, idiot.
-What happened to you?
-My wrist hurts.
Her wrist hurts.
That reminds me of something.
-There was this guy in our neighborhood...
-Who?
The one who was hit by a car.
He kept saying his wrist was hurting.
-What was his name? With thick hair...
-Şefik.
-No, not him.
-Necati.
-No, not him either.
-Okay, what’s the story?
I get stuck
when I can’t remember the name.
I can’t tell the story.
Why does the name matter?
Tell us what happened.
-No, I need to remember the name.
-Oh, God.
The one whose son stole his money
and wasted it on horse races.
-Vedat.
-No, not him either.
I’ll tell you when I remember the name.
Alright, don’t tell it.
Not when you remember either.
He lost everything he had.
He was out on the streets. Miserable.
-To hell with him! Who is this man?
-Serdar!
-How would you know?
-I tried my luck.
-You know what? It’s Serdar.
-What?
She doesn’t know her own name,
but she got the name.
Serdar?
-The hardware dealer?
-Yes. The one with thick hair.
So what happened
after the car hit Serdar?
We’re almost there.
Don’t keep me speaking. Just look at us!
The girl calls herself Çilek!
Perhaps I should call myself Armut.
And we should call you Elma.
And we should go to the emergency room
and say: "Hello, we’re all fruits!"
-Thank you very much, Doctor.
-Get well soon.
Şeref, could you give back
the stethoscope?
I’ll give it back once the song is over.
-When will he recover?
-We’ve given him a strong tranquillizer.
-But he’ll get well soon.
-Thank you.
Over here! This way!
-What happened?
-He’s so thick-headed
that it took six injections
to tranquillize him.
-Are you alright?
-Yes, I’m fine.
The doctor told me to keep
the bandage on for a few days.
-Come on.
-Hello.
Could you please sit down
for a few minutes?
We’ll have a few questions for you.
I don’t like slow songs.
-What’s wrong with the gentleman?
-They gave him a tranquillizer.
Please.
Let’s sit over there. Şeref, come here.
Turn around. Sit down.
What is the matter?
There has been an accident.
We heard the gentleman hit you.
Will you file a complaint with him?
There was no accident, Mr. Officer.
We’re friends!
He stopped to pick me up on his way,
and we were fooling around
and as he drove the car towards me,
and bump!
He gently bumped into me.
That’s all.
I’m not filing a complaint.
Are you really friends?
Of course we are.
We are clearly, indisputably friends.
We’re buddies! High five!
There you go. We’re also milk siblings.
I mean, her mother was my milk mother.
When we were babies,
we sucked on the same breasts.
Such is our friendship.
Way to go, buddy. High five!
Right, buddy. Those were the days.
Do you have anything to say?
Hold that.
My bus has arrived. I’m off!
-Where are you going, sir?
-To the operation!
I’ll get off at Zeytinburnu!
Onur, come in! There’s room.
Thank you. You told the police
we were friends.
You saved us. Thank you.
Oh, no, we’re not friends.
We’re milk siblings, remember?
I’m sorry, I get a little silly
when I’m under distress.
Onur sometimes acts strangely.
I’d like to apologize in advance for him.
Şefer Yıldız. Yıldız Organization.
You must have seen it on the car.
-Yes. I’m Çilek.
-And I’m Onur.
Nice to meet you.
What do you do?
-I’m a YouTuber.
-A YouTuber?
I have a YouTube channel.
It’s called Çilek Zamanı.
Do you know an app called Travel Mates?
Of course we do. We met through that app.
I wish we hadn’t, but yes, we do know it.
I use that app. They became my sponsor.
I go out on trips and ride in random cars.
I make funny, entertaining videos.
And just before you bumped into me,
I was on my way to a car.
We’re sorry to have interrupted your work.
Don’t worry. It was an accident.
-Did you take some good footage?
-In fact, it didn’t turn out very good.
-No way!
-Shut up.
-Why don’t you film us?
-What do you mean?
We’re going to Çeşme
for a singing contest.
A singing contest? When?
-In two days.
-Where are you going now?
I booked some extra gigs for Onur,
to warm him up for the contest.
I don’t know.
You met on Travel Mates, after all.
Singing contest, extra gigs...
It’s a nice story.
We’ve got so many stories!
So we’re set, then.
Great.
Great! Well done.
-What?
-Well done!
-What?
-Nothing.
I haven’t done anything wrong.
Okay, I’m driving. Let’s talk later.
Well, we agreed about this with Şeref,
but perhaps you don’t want it.
No, really.
We’ve interrupted your work already.
I’d like you to come with us,
but I’ll appreciate it
if you don’t film me.
You just film me!
I’ve told Onur a thousand times
that we should start a YouTube channel
and upload videos of him singing.
-He never paid any attention.
-Why?
I don’t know. I feel I’ll embarrass myself
if I put things on the internet.
I don’t really have the courage for that.
When you talked about YouTube
and fun videos,
-I got a thousand ideas.
-Really?
-Can you film right now?
-Yes.
So turn on your camera.
Şeref, wait a minute. Okay. Not right now.
Come on, you’ll like it.
But you have to come here,
and I have to go over there.
-Okay.
-How?
I’ll go over there and he’ll come here.
Wait! Her foot is hurt.
Let me pull over first.
Okay.
-Here.
-It’ll be great.
-Are you ready?
-I’m ready.
We’re ruined!
-Okay, I’m ready.
-But I told you.
-Don’t film me. I don’t want it.
-Okay, you sit back.
Oh, no.
Goodness!
There’s a traffic radar up ahead!
A radar!
Come inside!
Sir, have you got a spare dime?
I need to get back home, to Krypton!
You’ll hurt yourself!
Şeref!
You were scared, weren’t you?
You were, right?
Yes, we were scared.
-But it was great.
-It was great but I was so scared.
How do you come up
with this kind of silly stuff?
I saw this somewhere before.
Can you play the video?
-Come here.
-Play it.
-Look!
-It’s great.
It’s great. I remembered this move
the moment I saw the trailer truck.
In my mouth.
-Nevzat, tune in my music.
-Yes, sir.
It was a rainy night.
I came home a little drunk.
When there’s alcohol in your body,
certain organs want to get to work.
You were conceived that night.
I can’t say you were a stray bullet...
because...
"bullet" might be too dynamic
a metaphor for you.
Looking back now, I think...
if your mother had been asleep
that night...
or if I had dozed off, or...
at least if I had used protection...
none of this would have happened to me.
What happened, Dad?
I gave the deed you gave me
in place of your debt to me
to someone else,
in place of my debt to them.
But I learned today that the deed
had a debt attached.
Because of you...
worthless guys have been giving me
a fuss over nothing but a dime!
I may have suffered because...
I wasn’t using protection that night.
But today I’ll wear protection...
not to hurt my hand!
Come here.
Come.
Dad!
Get up! Get up!
You’re embarrassing me
in front of the guys.
I did my best for you to become a man,
for you not to get into dirty business.
If you’re going to do business,
do it properly.
Don’t make me regret
not using protection that night.
Give him his deed.
- Is this where I’m playing? "Aşk Olsun"
- Yes.
-It’s not another stupid place, is it?
-Of course not.
Let’s get our stuff off the car.
Come on, Çilek.
I need to answer this call.
-Wait for me at the door. I’ll join you.
-Okay.
Selim, I swear I only borrowed the car.
I’ll bring it back after the contest.
Did you steal my car too, you jerk?
Didn’t you know?
I shouldn’t have told you.
What was the matter?
The deed you gave us turned out
to have a debt attached!
-You’re kidding.
-Do I sound like...
...I’m kidding? Do I? My father...
-...made a fool of me because of you!
-You gave the deed to your father?
Please, I stand by my debt.
That place is...
-...very important for me.
-That piece of land
has no value for me now.
Neither do you.
I really had no idea about this.
I’ll pay back my debt after the contest.
I promise.
We’ll do much business together.
-I’ve got much business to with you!
-Selim!
This is really a misunderstanding.
Forgive me. Forgiveness...
...is compassion.
Hello? Selim?
I’m coming.
He stole the car too!
You handled this very well.
Get ready. We’re leaving. Come on!
Come on!
Okay, I’ll take care of it!
Şeref, I’m not singing in this place.
It will be a nice experience
for you before the contest.
I don’t want that experience!
-We’ve already been paid!
-So what?
You should’ve thought of that
before bringing me to tavern.
You said it was a bar!
Let’s ask Çilek.
Çilek, is this place that bad?
Why are we asking Çilek?
Right. I’ll upload the last video
we filmed to the channel.
Onur, we’ve come all the way here. Please.
Şeref, I have my own life,
my own standards.
You know the schools I’ve studied at.
My personality, my character.
-I don’t belong here, man!
-Onur! Welcome.
Hello.
You don’t recognize me?
-I don’t.
-We were together at high school?
At high school?
In the same class?
High school, same class...
-Merve?
-No.
-Ayşen?
-Not her either.
-I don’t remember you.
-I’m Yeliz!
You’re Yeliz, but I don’t remember you.
I’m Tufan, man! It’s me!
Tufan, 342.
-Tufan?
-Right, Tufan. How do I look?
Good. Different.
Well, you used to be "very Tufan"
back then, but now...
you’re really Yeliz!
-Hello. I’m Şeref.
-Hello darling.
-And I’m Çilek.
-Okay.
I was so excited to see you on the poster.
I was so happy.
We used to play in the school team
together. Double strikers!
He crossed the ball and I hit it!
I crossed and he hit it!
-Well, people may misinterpret that...
-You know, this guy...
all the girls were after him.
I was too, but I couldn’t show it.
I was "too Tufan" back then.
-A really big one.
-Thank you, Tufi. It’s nice of you, Yeliz.
What was your name, darling?
Or are you his sweetie?
-No, I’m not.
-Nice to meet you! I’m Yeliz.
-Or are you his sweetie?
-No way!
You’re such a sweet thing.
What breed are you?
We had a great laugh.
I need to go now. My guy is here.
He might make a fuss.
My friend, I’m so happy to meet you.
-You’re in the right place.
-I’m so happy too.
This will be a long night.
We have so much more to talk about.
So much more!
You know what we’ll talk about?
-I don’t know.
-All sorts of things!
All sorts of things!
Perhaps you want to sing here now.
You’ll play as double strikers
after many years!
Don’t get Yeliz into this.
I told you before.
-I’m not going to sing here!
-We’ve been paid in advance!
-We’ll get in trouble.
-I don’t care if we do!
I’m not wearing these silly clothes,
and I’m not getting on that scene!
I don’t care! I’m not doing it!
Mountains, enemies,
liars have come between us
Everyone kept telling me
That you’re a devil
When I heard you left me
I couldn’t believe it
You have no conscience at all
Don’t make me beg to God
Don’t harden my heart
Don’t ask about me, I’m scarred
But I hope I’ll be alright
Don’t make me beg to God
Don’t harden my heart...
Who the hell is this guy?
He’s my friend from high school!
-No way.
-I swear. That’s my Onur! What a voice!
Look, that guy is way out of line!
What do you mean he’s out of line?
Keep your nose out!
I’m the only one
who can nose about your life!
Şeref?
That guy next to Yeliz
looks like he’s up to trouble.
Okay, you be careful. I’ll talk to him.
Good evening, sir.
-Is something wrong?
-Who the hell are you?
I’m Onur’s promoter.
Oh, good. Now go and tell your man Onur
that no man in this world can ever
wink at the woman
sitting next to me!
There must have been a misunderstanding.
Onur would never do that.
So you say I’m lying, right?
Am I lying? Mind your words!
-Calm down!
-You shut up!
-Sir, please!
-Shut up!
-Stop filming me!
-No, sir, I wasn’t filming you!
Put your hand down! Don’t make me crazy.
No, you don’t make me crazy!
Şeref! Çilek!
The man is bleeding!
Okay, bring it on!
Get out of here!
-I’ll show you!
-Go away!
Why break another window
when there’s a broken one already?
-Şeref, get in the car!
-Onur, wait a second.
Wait for me! I’ll be right back!
Şeref!
-Come here!
-Şeref!
I can’t beat them. Let’s go.
Let me see. What is it?
Look.
-Because of your Tufi!
-What does Tufi have to do with it?
I saw what you were doing
to each other on the stage!
-What did we do?
-"All sorts of things!"
"All sorts of things."
Because of this silly attitude of yours,
I’m going back to İstanbul tomorrow.
You understand?
Wait a second!
-What happened?
-We got on the road again
and we’re already
in a mess on the first day.
Onur, it’s too late to go back!
I’m going back early tomorrow.
You do as you like.
You can’t go back.
What do you mean I can’t?
Of course I can.
Selim is looking for us in İstanbul.
He’s looking for us?
Didn’t you get permission from him?
I thought I did,
but it turns out he hasn’t given it.
He’s a bit angry with us.
-He’s angry?
-He gave permission at first.
Then he called and scolded me,
perhaps because the döner shop is empty.
He’s angry with you!
I’ve got nothing to do with it.
I’m going back tomorrow.
You can’t, because we borrowed
his car without permission.
You can’t borrow something
without permission, Şeref.
That’s called stealing.
We kind of stole it.
We took it, to give it back later.
Let’s not change our plans.
I promise you. Tomorrow will be
a much better day than today.
Enough of this nonsense.
I have an '80s and '90s party
booked for you.
And then a wedding.
They’re both paying 2,000 liras each.
Okay?
And now we have this Selim problem...
Nothing will go wrong
in these other gigs, right?
Nothing. I promise.
When you win the contest,
you’ll be glad I’m your promoter.
-Just don’t make me curse after you.
-Amen.
Çilek is a fine girl.
She’s brought fresh energy
to our journey.
Yes, she’s alright.
And she’s beautiful.
And we’re in strawberry season!
She’s beautiful, but I don’t care.
Why? You’ve been cold to her.
I’m fresh out of a relationship.
I don’t think I can easily
trust anyone now.
That all depends.
Don’t condition yourself.
No, this is clear. I don’t want this.
Me, I don’t want it at all.
She’s not my type, to begin with.
I wonder if you’re anybody’s type at all!
I deserve better. That’s for sure.
This relationship thing
has really worn me out.
You say: "It won’t end this time,"
every time.
Every time, you say:
"I’ll be happy forever."
But it doesn’t work out.
Every time, it ends.
I no longer want the happiness
at the start of love,
nor the sorrow at the end.
Falling in love is just no good.
And you know why it’s no good?
Love makes you sad,
making people sad makes you loved.
That’s how it is.
You know what, you’re a monster.
The figs are so fresh.
You must have some.
Take a bite.
-I’m going to bed.
-Where are you going?
You should’ve stayed
until the figs are gone.
Onur.

Şeref, the Superman video we filmed
yesterday is getting lots of views.
-Onur, did you hear that?
-Don’t wind him up. Please.
Too late. I’m all wound up.
I’ll pay for the fuel and get
some stuff to eat, okay?
Okay.
-One hundred liras, please.
-I’ll go to the toilet.
Okay.
How can I help you?
-Cemre!
-Şeref!
You work here now?
Yes.
Şeref, what happened to you?
Are you alright?
A small accident. I’m fine.
-Get well soon.
-Thank you.
Where are you going?
I’m going to a singing contest with Onur.
To Çeşme.
-I’m his promoter.
-That’s great to hear.
-Why didn’t you answer my calls?
-Şeref...
The night when we first met,
I told you about my ex-boyfriend.
You remember?
-Yes.
-And I told you he looked like you.
-Yes.
-I got back together with him.
So, that’s why I couldn’t answer
your calls. I’m sorry.
Well, as long as you’re happy...
Really?
Yes.
Thank you.
You know what? He works here too.
He works the pump.
He works the pump.
That’s great.
Veli!
Darling, can you come over for a minute?
Baby?
Darling, you remember the man
I had told you about?
-Who?
-Şeref.
Şeref?
Oh, the man you said looked like me.
Darling, come closer.
I’ll tell you something.
-Do I look like this man, dear?
-What?
-Do I look like this man?
-Why, darling?
What is this?
What kind of a mess is this?
What kind of a look is this?
Brother, turn left.
Left.
What an ugly chin!
-Do I look like this thing?
-Veli, don’t do that.
Are you crazy?
It’s not like you’re Brad Pitt!
Alright, I’m not Brad Pitt.
But I’m not that thing either!
Darling, this is so bad. So bad!
Darling, please, don’t do that.
Alright, I’m sorry.
He doesn’t look like you.
You know, I’m bleeding inside.
Really, I’m bleeding inside.
Here’s your money for the fuel!
I’m at a loss for words!
Şeref!
What?
Too bad!
Şeref!
What happened?
-Şeref!
-Oh!
Şeref, stop it!
-Şeref!
-Get away, it’s coming!
The brush is coming! Stop the machine!
You’ll hurt yourself!
Stop the machine!
Şeref, are you alright?
Şeref, what do you think you’re doing?
Let’s go. We’re late.
Come on.
Don’t look at me. Çilek, get in.
Shall I change my clothes?
-Huh?
-Your choice.
Alright, stop worrying about this.
I still can’t believe it.
For God’s sake, tell me,
am I the kind of man to be left behind?
-Right.
-I’m doing great, I’m telling you.
-Right.
-It’s her loss.
She was dating her boyfriend
because he looked like you anyway.
Imitation is flattery.
No, that’s not exactly how it works.
He dated Şeref because
he looked like his ex-boyfriend.
So Şeref is the imitation here.
-Yes, I’m the imitation.
-Never mind. You can find another girl.
Right.
-Come on, smile!
-How can I smile?
-Hello!
-Don’t!
-Hello!
-Please, don’t.
I’ll tickle you! That’s so sweet!
-Don’t do it, I’m feeling weird.
-Okay, I’m stopping.
Just one more!
Stop it! Or I’ll jump off the car!
Don’t do it.
He actually jumps off the car.
Yes, I have.
Let me lock that door.
-Cheers!
-There you go.
That’s the way!
It’s the organizers.
Hello? Yes?
Yes, it’s me.
That seems to have gone loose.
-Yes.
-Would you like me to help?
Please?
-Let me open it.
-Okay.
They make these things so frail.
I’ll tighten it a bit.
-Okay.
-It’s not too tight, is it?
-No.
-Alright.
-If I pull it that way, is that better?
-It’s good now. Thank you.
Thank you too.
Onur! Çilek! Come over here.
There’s a wish tree here. Come over!
-It’s so sweet!
-Come, let’s make out wishes.
Okay. Give me one.
What did you wish?
-They say it doesn’t work if you say it.
-I think that’s superstitious.
Tying rags on a tree isn’t superstitious,
but that is?
I don’t care, I’ll say it.
I wished for a new love for myself.
That’s nice.
Tell me yours. I’m curious.
Okay, I wished to learn what you wished.
My wish came true before yours.
Why?
Because you have to tie the rag tight.
Şeref, what did you wish?
I placed a bet for
the Barcelona-Valencia game tonight.
I hope I win.
I played for 10 liras. It pays 22.
-He’s recovered.
-I’m fine right now.
-You’re fine.
-Let’s take a photo over there.
-Let’s take it here.
-Come on.
You go over. I’ll take your photo.
Okay, you don’t come, wild man.
Go over there and pose for me.
-Come over here.
-Right.
Get ready! Now!
-Great!
-Let me see it.
Look.
The bride...
-It’s so cute!
-It’s really nice.
-It’s a bit strange, yes.
-It’s great.
I’ve always dreamed of myself
in that white dress.
-Here you are.
-Here I am.
This is the location the girl shared.
Sorry, the lady.
Did this man come here?
No.
I haven’t seen him.
You haven’t?
-I haven’t.
-Are you sure?
I am.
Anything else I can help you with?
Do you have any change, darling?
Hello.
Brother. Come here.
Come closer.
Do you know this guy?
I do.
I wish I didn’t know
that five-letter name.
I don’t want to say his name.
He might come back.
-When did he come here?
-They came a few hours ago.
He had a man and a woman with him.
He said they were entering
a contest or something.
They went that way!
You look so much like Şeref.
-Are you related to him?
-Sir!
For God’s sake,
I don’t look anything like him!
What on earth is he?
What kind of a face is that!
-That chin...
-Enough!
What?
The phone is ringing.
-What are you doing?
-My pocket is too narrow.
Şeref, stop it!
It’s Cemre.
Will you answer it?
I don’t know. Should I or shouldn’t I?
Yes, Cemre?
-Hello, Şeref?
-Yes? Why are you calling me?
Şeref, four strange men came here.
They asked about you.
-Oh, really?
-Yes.
You’re alright, aren’t you?
You’re not in trouble?
-Of course not. Everything is okay.
-Oh, good. Alright, then.
What else?
Nothing else.
Okay, you don’t have to apologize.
-What?
Oh, you’re really exaggerating.
She’s crying.
Cemre, get back on your feet,
and hold onto your boyfriend,
get used to being without me.
Please don’t cry.
Please.
I hung up first.
What did she say?
Oh, it’s nothing.
His number looks like mine!
-What did she say?
-She says she’s very sorry...
like she’ll come back
right away if I want her to.
And I don’t actually look like
her boyfriend.
I’m much more handsome
and my sex appeal is much greater,
my libido is so high and so on.
It’s too late for these things, girl!
That’s my brother! High five!
That’s the way.
-There’s no trusting women, brother.
-Exactly.
Why is that so?
Because we’ve been let down
enough times,
so we have no trust left in women.
-Right.
-I don’t agree with you at all.
You can’t generalize that to all women.
That’s not the way to insinuate.
It’s an '80s and '90s party, right?
Of course. An '80s and '90s party.
Great.
I took the right turn, didn’t I?
It’s the right place?
Yes, we’re in the right place.
Come on.
You said it was an '80s and '90s party?
Well, here are the eighties...
...and the nineties.
You booked me a nursing home gig?
On this beautiful day when
we celebrate the 100th birthday
of Ms. Neriman,
I invite Onur Güzel to the stage,
with your applause!
Bravo!
We’ll have a lot of fun.
It’s going to be great.
Before I died
I had many friends
-What are you doing?
-Before I died
"Before I died!" Change it! Change it!
Switch to the next song! Next song!
I’m going to die tonight
Nobody can stop me
You can’t stop me
Neither can the stars
I fall down your eyes
like falling down a chasm...
I’m sorry.
Nothing can stop me
not even your eyes
What are you trying to do?
You’ve prepared a deadly repertoire!
You said it was '80s and '90s,
so I picked the repertoire accordingly!
Forget about death!
It’s not good for the audience.
Change the song!
Let’s get moving, with something faster.
Get moving! Let me see your hands!
Shh, shh, calm down
Don’t lose your temper
Shh, shh, calm down
Don’t lose...
This mortal life, these mortal men
Who cares if you’re wise or cruel
This mortal life, these mortal men...
You messed it all up! Wrap it up!
Wrap it up! Next song!
Don’t look back, traveler
The night has come to take you away
Don’t ask about me, traveler
Don’t call me where you go
Don’t you come back, traveler
Destiny has come...
Let’s thank Onur Güzel with our applause!
On this beautiful day when we celebrate
the 100th birthday of Ms. Neriman,
we would now like to get her birthday cake
over here, with your applause.
Sixty! Seventy!
Eighty! Ninety!
One hundred!
You see, Ms. Neriman is still so lively.
Ms. Neriman, you really don’t look 100.
You’re like 97 at most!
Happy birthday Neriman
Happy birthday Neriman
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday Neriman
Blow it! Blow it!
Is she breathing?
-Why are you looking at me?
-The woman.
-So?
-She died!
What are you implying?
You sang one song
about death after another
and encouraged the woman to die!
-She felt like dying!
-Oh, really?
What about your tactless jokes?
She doesn’t look 100, she’s 97 at most...
-You made the woman grow cold of life!
-Calm down.
Stop accusing each other.
They said the poor woman
was in bad health lately.
It was her time to go.
May God bless her.
-Amen.
-Amen.
But she let our her last breath
in a rather strange way.
God forgive me!
Just as people said happy birthday.
Okay.
Shut up!
-Let’s look ahead.
-Right.
I’m singing at a wedding, right?
Just a normal wedding.
Right, a normal village wedding.
You’re playing the wedding tonight,
and tomorrow night is the contest.
-It’s all going as planned.
-Okay.
Just a second, it’s the phone.
SELİM
Who’s calling?
-It’s about the contest organization.
-Answer it. I wonder what they’ll say.
Let’s find the wedding place
and I’ll get back to them later.
You can park on the left.
-Here?
-Yes.
You take out the stuff and go in.
I’ll talk to the organizers on the phone.
Okay.
Right.
This guy is going completely crazy.
Why aren’t you answering your phone?
Selim, please stop chasing us.
I’ll make it all right, I promise.
-Your promises have no meaning for me.
-We’re of no use to you.
-We’re at your mercy!
-I’ll decide what to do with you.
Once I come over there.
Where the hell are you?
-But look...
-Tell me!
Okay, I’m telling you the address.
We invite everybody on the dance floor.
Please.
Don’t leave the dance floor empty.
Here’s the bride’s henna
Here’s the bride’s henna
Let the bride’s mother cry
Let the bride’s mother cry
They’re our son and our daughter
They’re our son and our daughter
Let the mother-in-law
eat her heart out
Let the mother-in-law
eat her heart out
Here comes the wedding crowd
Let the mothers-in-law dance
Hands up!
We’ve been playing for an hour.
Nobody is dancing or having fun.
-What sort of wedding is this?
-I’ve just heard it.
The bride and the groom eloped together.
Without the consent of the families.
So the wedding is a bit tense.
Get off the stage!
Let’s have everybody on the dance floor.
Şeref!
I’ll take care of it.
-The back section!
-Şeref, please.
Altogether!
-This is your happiest day!
-Hands up!
-Brother.
-Yes, sir?
Where is the driver to pick up
the bride and groom?
No need for a driver, sir.
I’ll take care of it.
-The bride and groom are coming.
-Wait, wait!
Dear visitors,
here is that long-awaited moment!
Now, a strong round of applause
for the bride and the groom!
Come on!
-Çilek!
-I’m filming.
Make sure you film it!
Okay, calm down.
What are you trying to do!
I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean it!
-Sorry!
-What do you think you’re doing!
-Okay, calm down!
-We can work this out!
Şeref, on the next table?
I’m very sorry.
Please, let’s not ruin this night.
-Okay, okay.
-Please. Let’s continue.
The next song is from the groom,
for the bride.
Let’s hear it:
What does the groom tell the bride?
Who in this world loves you the most?
Of course it’s me
Who is the one to praise you the most?
Of course it’s me
My black-haired, sharp-eyed one
Mercy, mercy me
For I’m in trouble
Without you, my life is a waste
My days without you are worthless
Pity me
Don’t deny it
Say it, say it Play on.
I’m out of words!
Look at the wedding you booked!
-I’m trying my best!
-Oh, are you?
Of course it’s me
-I really don’t deserve this.
-You deserve much more,
but I don’t even know what to say to you.
Of course it’s me
Which of us
constantly avoids responsibility
and blames the other
for every problem?
Of course it’s me
Of course it’s me
Of course it’s you! Stop accusing me.
The cake is coming soon.
I’ll do some warming up.
It’s about time you worked that stage!
Let’s both do our jobs!
And now, with your loud applause,
here comes the wedding cake!
Bravo! I’d like to invite the families
of the bride and the groom
onstage to cut the cake.
Applause for the families!
Please, come on the stage.
The families, please!
At least be with your children
while the cake is cut.
Yes, please. Let’s cut the cake together.
I’m getting angry.
I’ll set myself on fire, I swear!
-Here they come, with applause!
-Bravo!
Excellent!
Please, let’s applaud the families!
Great! Smiling faces.
Wonderful.
Okay, let’s gather around the cake.
Sing something nice for the families
Okay, I’ve got it.
Şeref, the bride is on fire!
-The bride is on fire!
-Sir, pass me the lemonade!
Sir, did you put alcohol in this?
-You burned the bride!
-Sir, I...
You got our son in trouble, and here,
you ended up in trouble too!
-We’re not forcing him to marry her!
-We don’t want her anyway!
It’s not like we like your bride so much!
Sir, please!
Please, stop it!
Dear families, please!
Dear families!
Şeref, please break them up!
Please, calm down!
This is a wedding!
Please listen to me.
Enough!
This is such a shame!
This girl and this boy fell in love,
and they wanted to get married.
Isn’t this such a shame?
You’ve been standing between them
with your sulking faces all night!
And now you’re fighting.
What sort of family are you!
You’re supposed to share their happiness.
Now, everyone will get on the dance floor.
We’ll play music, and you’ll dance!
And this couple
will go home happy tonight!
Play!
Dance!
Yes!
Right, dance!
Come to the orchard
come to the garden
Speak your heart, become a legend
Ley-lim, ley-lim, ley-lim
Speak your heart, become a legend
Ley-lim, ley-lim, ley-lim
If your mother doesn’t let you go
Pretend that you’re sick
Ley-lim, ley-lim, ley-lim
Pretend that you’re sick
Ley-lim, ley-lim, ley-lim...
He gave us the wrong address!
What?
That jerk gave us the wrong address.
Şeref, I can’t waste any more time
with the tent. I’m exhausted.
Okay, okay.
I’m tired.
SELİM
Çilek, this is a nice place, isn’t it?
Yes. I love it.
-Look.
-I mean, it’s nice, but...
I’m not sure if we’ll be comfortable here.
I used to come here with my parents
very often when I was little.
-I’ve missed the place.
-Really?
-Who needs a hotel!
-Alright, we’re staying in a tent. Okay.
-I’ll bring the suitcases.
-Thank you.
Çilek is a beautiful name.
- Who gave it to you?
-My mother.
When she first got me in her arms,
I smelled like strawberries.
-It’s a beautiful name.
-Thank you.
-Where are they now?
-They both retired. They live in İzmir.
What about yours?
-I think we shouldn’t go into that.
-Why?
-We can’t get out.
-Oh. I’m sorry.
It’s alright.
I can’t meet my father very often
because of my stepmother.
And my mother left me when I was little.
I told you we couldn’t get out of it.
-Right. So how shall we go out?
-I don’t know.
You’re great on stage. Really.
You have a great voice.
But you seem to be a little uptight. Why?
You see how I changed the subject?
I do, but we can’t get out of this either.
-Why?
-This is complicated too.
Really?
You know, when you’re little...
you want your mother to see
everything you do.
Even when you jump in the water,
you say: "Mom, look!"
You feel better
when your mother is watching.
When I lost my mother...
I think I lost my first spectator too.
That’s why, when I go
in front of an audience,
I feel like I’ll lose their attention
right away.
I don’t know, it’s strange.
I both want everybody to see me,
and to be seen by nobody.
I’m sorry.
I’ve reminded you of bad things.
It’s okay. I’m used to it.
So, I’ll make another move
to change the subject. Are you ready?
-I’m ready.
-Do you have a girlfriend?
That’s a rather bold move.
I mean, I feel you’re a bit too shut in.
I thought,
maybe you have a jealous girlfriend.
No. I don’t have a girlfriend.
We separated.
But it’s not been a long time.
-So I may be a little shut in.
-I see.
-So where is she now?
-She went abroad.
-And then?
-She said: "Wait for me," and left.
I waited. And she didn’t come back.
"It was something like death
but nobody died."
-You like him?
-Who?
Özdemir Asaf.
Who’s that?
The poet who wrote that poem.
I don’t know him.
I saw this poem on the newspaper
I was clipping my nails on.
-And I memorized it.
-What?
-I’m joking! He’s my favorite poet.
-Mine too.
-I’m feeling a little cold.
-Me too.
-It’s getting rather cold.
-Right, quite cold. It’s chilly today.
Sorry, you’re getting really cold.
And he didn’t bring the suitcases.
I can’t give you my shirt either.
My trousers, I definitely can’t.
-Anyway, it’s alright.
-Well, okay.
I’m sorry, but...
when a woman says "I’m cold,"
you have to find a solution.
Right, right, I...
Perhaps I should come closer to you?
Maybe if I do this, you’ll get warmer.
What do you think?
-It’s silly, but not bad.
-This is silly.
And I’ve got this arm, if you want it.
Perhaps I should put it on your shoulder.
It might make you warmer.
-Let’s see.
-Let’s see.
Like that? But that won’t help.
Like that.
-Are you warming up?
-Yes.
-I’m warming up.
-Me too.
-Onur! What’s going on?
-Sorry! I’m sorry!
I have a tic for frogs!
-Şeref, stop it!
-What happened?
-Oh, it’s his tic again!
-Is this another joke?
No, it’s real this time.
-Onur, I’m sorry. I forgot about it.
-How will it go away?
-It won’t go away easily.
-Şeref, to hell with you!
Thank you. Were you kissing?
Okay, no frog sound here.
We’ll have to sleep in the car tonight.
I can’t sleep by the lakeside.
I can’t either. I’ll be too scared alone.
-But please, stop laughing.
-Okay, sorry.
How did this tic start?
When I was little,
at a school picnic, a friend put a...
-in my mouth. A friend just like him!
-Don’t say that.
Film him.
I bought you a present to forgive me,
and look how you talk about me.
A present? Why?
I thought I’d definitely make you upset
on the road, so I bought it in advance!
That’s a surprise.
What’s that!
That’s a horrible joke! Put it away!
Okay, I’m putting it away.
Goodness!
Stop it.
Okay. I’m going to sleep. Good night.
Good night.
You’ll come with us to the contest
tomorrow, right?
Well, in fact,
I was planning to leave you tomorrow.
I was going to join my friends, but...
But?
I can text them and cancel it.
I’m pleased.
-Okay.
-Okay.
-I’ll get warm clothes from the trunk.
-Okay.
What?
-Come close.
-What?
Whoever sits on that back seat
falls in love with you!
Mind your words! She’ll hear you.
-I’m too afraid to sit on the back seat.
-Don’t be silly. Go to sleep.
-I’m glad I’m on the front seat.
-Shut up!
-See if I look pretty from here?
-Stop it! She’s coming.
-Am I pretty?
-Stop it! Don’t talk nonsense.
Good night!
Good night.
Good night.
No, no, no. It’s not what you think.
Wait a minute. Şeref, wake up!
Okay, I’m waking up.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-We’ve slept until noon!
-Come on, we’ll be late for the contest!
Oh, the contest. It’s today.
Did you talk to your friends?
You’re coming with us, aren’t you?
I texted them last night
but they haven’t written back yet.
What shall we do?
I was going to meet them
at a rest stop anyway.
-Let’s go there and talk to them.
-Is it on our way?
Yes, it is.
Alright, we’ll stop by.
And then we’ll get on our way.
Let’s change our clothes
before we set off.
You’re right.
What are you doing, idiot?
Go change outside.
Sorry, I forgot. You’re right.
I’m coming.
Oh, it’s Onur and Şeref!
-I’ll talk to them.
-Oh, Çilek!
Hello.
-How are you?
-Hello.
-Hello, how are you?
-Hello.
You’re incredibly funny.
That video when you fly near the car
like Superman!
We laughed so hard!
-You hear that?
-Right, right.
But your frog tic was really something.
The kids just showed it to us.
I laughed so hard I was breathless.
Yes, that was so funny.
The frog tic?
I think Şeref gave you
a stuffed frog as a present.
I was going to upload the video
that Şeref filmed at the wedding,
where he dropped the bride and groom.
I really didn’t mean to upload this.
I uploaded the wrong video.
I’m very sorry. Believe me.
Little frog, little frog
Where is your tail?
Kids, stop! Please!
-I have no tail, I have no tail...
-Kids, please!
-Enough!
-Get out of here!
Onur... I uploaded the wrong video.
I’m really sorry.
So you’ve been filming me secretly?
-I told her to film you.
-Well done!
I was filming them just to keep
as memories. Really.
Just for memories.
So, now that we’ve shared the frog video,
what’s next?
How about this: You start filming.
I’ll tell you how my mother
left me when I was a kid.
That’s more dramatic.
You’ll get more followers.
Okay? Come on, start filming.
Okay.
-I think I’ll join my friends.
-I think you should.
Good luck for the contest.
-Çilek, wait a minute!
-Şeref, okay. She’s gone.
She told you
she didn’t mean to upload it!
You shut up!
She got in the car because of you anyway.
Great. You don’t trust me,
you don’t trust Çilek.
You don’t trust anybody.
That’s a great idea. Everyone is terrible,
and only you’re great.
Who are you to teach me lessons!
I’m not going to be a student
of your silly lessons!
-See? I guess you don’t have an answer.
-I’m offended.
I’m going to the toilet.
-Selim!
-Şeref!
-Selim!
-Onur!
-Nevzat!
-Şeref!
-Selim, greetings.
-Finish it.
Finish up.
Okay.
-Şeref, what’s going on?
-Relieve yourself for the last time, Onur.
-Relieve yourself for the last time.
Please, listen...
Let’s wash our hands thoroughly first.
Okay.
What’s going on?
Sir!
There’s no soap left here. Just a second.
Just a second.
I think the tap is broken here.
If I could use yours...
And there’s no soap here.
Shall I try?
Let me try.
The sensor is broken.
Let me check that one.
This is broken too.
Nevzat, wait a moment. I’ll...
Give that to Selim.
I’ll have some for myself.
-Nevzat, enough.
-Okay, sir.
-Get over there.
-What?
Get on your knees!
Get down!
Down, down!
Selim, what’s going on?
Selim!
Selim, why aren’t you talking?
This is where words end, Şeref.
I really didn’t know the land
had debt attached.
It makes no difference anyway.
We’ll pay our debt.
-Just let us enter the contest.
-What land? What money? What’s going on?
Şeref borrowed 20,000 liras
from us for your expenses.
He gave us the land in exchange.
And we gave the land to Selim’s father
in exchange for the rents.
When the deed turned out to be invalid,
his father screwed Selim.
Sorry, sir.
-Sir!
-Seagull.
Here’s your deed.
This is no longer about money, Şeref.
Did you give them the land
you inherited for the tour?
Look, I’m not sad about you.
But I’m very sad that this boy
with a beautiful voice will die.
Die? Selim, what are you talking about?
Let Onur go.
Do what you want to me.
Don’t touch my brother.
You, sing for me one last time.
How can I sing here?
A love song.
Slow.
Selim, I...
Sing!
Love, flee my spell
Love, return from the dead
Love, find a way
And come into my world
Go on.
-This is not a good place for singing.
-Go on!
Leave the lights off, Nevzat.
No!
-Are they still after us?
-I think they’re not.
-Slow down!
-Okay.
-Şeref.
-What?
I’m sorry.
Have we made peace now?
Do we have a choice?
Why did you borrow money
from these men?
I don’t know. I couldn’t bring myself
to accept you quitting music.
-Where did you spend 20,000 liras?
-I paid part of the money for
extra gigs to give you morale
before the contest.
-Didn’t you say we got paid for those?
-We did, but not that much.
And I spent the rest on the road,
for the motel, the contest and so on.
You’re really something, man!
I don’t know.
It seemed like a good idea at first.
What shall we do now? They’re after us.
Let’s go to the police.
I got 20,000 liras from these men.
And I also borrowed their car.
-We shouldn’t go to the police now.
-Right.
You know what we should do?
Let’s go to the contest.
You win the contest,
and we’ll get the 50,000 liras.
I’ll sort out the rest. I promise you.
If these men catch us, they’ll kill us.
And you’re still thinking about
the contest!
And how come you’re so sure I’ll win?
Brother, I trust you.
You’re going to win this contest.
You win, and leave the rest to me.
I’ll sort it out.
Alright, let’s go to the contest. Come on.
Great! But I need to speed up.
We’re running late.
Alright, speed up.
We’re smelling terrible.
And I’ll go on stage in these clothes.
-You smell bad.
-Stop smelling me.
I should get myself a t-shirt.
I’m smelling bad too.
Pass me my short-sleeve t-shirt.
-What’s that?
-The short-sleeve t-shirt.
I’ll wear this white one.
Move your seat.
-It doesn’t come out?
-Okay, wait.
- Where’s your t-shirt?
- I know where my short-sleeve is.
- Lower right, front.
- What does that mean?
-This one?
-Come on, do I wear that color?
I don’t know, it’s in your bag!
Don’t yell at me.
Find your own t-shirt.
I must come over there, right...
You couldn’t find a damn t-shirt!
-Here it is.
-Oh, was it that one?
-Yes.
-But who’s driving the car?
Şeref!
Hit the brake!
-The brake doesn’t work!
-Şeref, do something!
-I can’t!
-Stop the car!
Onur!
Onur!
Onur!
Calm down.
-Are you alright?
-Yes, I’m fine.
The car is on fire!
We have to get out, quick!
This way! This door!
From the side.
Onur, run! It’s going to explode!
-It didn’t.
-Yes.
Onur, come back!
It’s going to explode now.
-It again didn’t.
-Yes.
Let’s go and get our stuff.
See, it exploded.
I told you!
-Şeref!
-Yes?
You can’t do a single thing properly.
I agree.
Look at my face!
People are too afraid to stop!
If we can finish this trip in one piece,
I’ll count that as success.
We shouldn’t have unbuckled
our seat belts. Seat belts matter.
Cars have changed,
but seatbelts have remained the same.
Because they’re important.
You’ve got to wear your seat belt.
Is that a public service ad?
You’re talking nonsense again.
Stop a car. Lie on the road if you must.
We need to go to a hospital.
What hospital?
We have to make it to the contest.
-We have very little time.
-You don’t understand do you?
They would never let us in like this!
Destiny doesn’t want us to get there.
Accept that!
Let’s say it’s for the best
and give it up. It’s over.
Onur, I’m aware that I’ve got us
into a lot of trouble,
but please let me make up for it.
Onur.
Look, if you give up today,
you’ll ask yourself all your life:
"What would’ve happened
if I had entered the contest?"
I don’t want you to regret
your decision later.
Why don’t we learn the answer right now?
Come on.
What’s going on, kids? Are you alright?
-Muzaffer Usta?
-Yes, it’s me?
We’re Onur and Şeref.
We came to your repair shop last summer.
You remember?
-Muzaffer Usta,
we need to go to Çeşme, fast.
So go!
-How are we supposed to?
-Just bugger off!
He means, can you give us a lift?
Come in then, brother.
But, we’re in a real hurry.
So hold on tight!
I’m kidding.
This car is a Broadway!
8TH ÇEŞME SINGING CONTEST
Here we are.
This is as far as I can take you.
Thank you. We’ll find a way to get there.
-May God help you.
-Amen.
This way.
-Where is the place?
-Almost there.
Left, left!
So?
You didn’t finish the song.
What?
Selim! Please let us go!
Look, we made it to the contest.
I promise, we’ll make up for it all.
-Are you still thinking about the contest?
-Please, let me enter the contest!
If I can’t win, then we’ll talk.
I really feel great right now.
Great?
Looking like this?
Please, Selim!
Selim, I’m begging you!
Let us enter the contest.
You’ve already lost this contest.
Nevzat!
-Selim!
-Please!
-Selim!
-Please, Selim!
Onur!
-Give me your blessings.
-Be blessed, brother.
Nevzat!
It was a rainy night.
I came home drunk that night.
I wanted to give you a sibling.
Why?
To make sure you learn how to share...
you don’t get spoiled...
and be a proper man.
But not every bullet you fire
hits the bull’s-eye.
We tried a lot after that.
It didn’t work out.
I kept firing blanks.
And then, you grew up like a dog.
Dad!
How did you find me?
Your whole world belongs to me!
Nevzat!
Didn’t I tell you not to get into
dirty business,
not to play the mafia game?
Dad, it was these guys!
They gave me that invalid deed.
It was them who embarrassed me
in front of you.
Were you going to shoot these idiots
for a deed?
Why not? Should they go unpunished?
Walk on!
I’m not done with you.
-I’m not done with you.
-You are! You are done!
It’s all done. Get him in the car!
What the hell was that?
I don’t know!
Run, run!
Right! From the right!
From the left!
Çilek, let’s leave. They’re not coming.
-What shall we do now?
-I don’t know.
-What should we do?
-I don’t know.
Are you hungry?
I am.
Let’s eat over there.
Okay, let’s eat.
I’ll see what they have to eat.
-Let’s order here.
-I’ll take a look and order something.
Okay.
I’m sorry you missed the contest.
It’s alright. Don’t be sad, son.
There must be a misunderstanding.
Because my mother died.
I mean, for me.
Because when she left me...
I was three years old.
That’s why I don’t remember her at all.
When I was little, I tried to remember
her face when I missed her.
Of course, I failed.
So I would replace her with actresses.
So...
one day, my mother would be
Türkan Şoray...
the next day, Fatma Girik.
Filiz Akın.
It’s hard to grow up motherless.
But I did it. I succeeded.
So let’s leave it the way it is. Okay?
If I wanted to remember my mother
one day...
I’d remember Türkan Şoray.
And I’d be happy.
Onur, dear!
Please, listen to me.
I don’t want to listen to you.
Onur, I understand you. You’re right.
For years, I was too afraid to see you.
I know how upset you are with me.
Five years ago, I had a major accident.
I barely escaped death.
Even on the last moment,
when I thought I’d die,
I could only remember your face.
That’s when I understood.
That no matter what, I didn’t want to die
before I saw your face one more time.
Your friend Şeref was of great help.
I’m grateful to him.
-Şeref?
-Yes, Şeref.
He called me and encouraged me
to come here.
He even paid for all my expenses.
Onur, I know it’s too late
to talk about these things.
But all my life...
I’ve been waiting to live
these five minutes.
I wanted to see up close
what a handsome man
my son had become.
I can’t say: "I can die at ease now."
Because I died the day I lost you.
Please.
Mom!
Onur!
My son!
Şeref?
Wait a minute!
What’s going on here?
I couldn’t let you live without a mother,
when your mother was alive.
I know well what it’s like
to be without a mother.
Okay, I understand.
Look, I found my mother
after so many years. Thank you.
-I feel terrible.
-Şeref, calm down.
-I’m a bit upset right now.
-Şeref, it’s alright.
Okay.
Şeref, I’ve met my mother after 30 years.
I want to enjoy that.
I don’t want to console you.
Stop stealing the scene! Enough.
-You’re right.
-Şeref told me some things.
-Are you alright now?
-We’re fine. Let’s sit down.
-I’ll tell you everything.
-Okay.
You’re such a beautiful man.
-Am I really beautiful?
-Yes, you really are.
-We have so much more to do together.
-Like what?
All sorts of things!
-Come on.
-Let’s go.
Sit down.
Right.
What shall we eat?
-What shall we eat?
-We’re hungry!
-Aren’t we?
-Yes, we’re hungry.
Ms. Gülümser!
I’m hanging up now.
We’ll call you after the concert.
-I have a surprise for Onur.
-Thank you.
Mountains, enemies, liars
have come between us
Everyone kept telling me
That you’re a devil
When I heard you left me
I couldn’t believe it
You have no conscience at all
Jealous eyes, lying words
infidels have broken our love
Everyone lied to me
And disparaged you
You couldn’t trust me,
you thought I cheated on you
You have no mercy at all
Don’t make me beg to God
Don’t harden my heart
Don’t ask about me, I’m scarred
But I hope I’ll be alright
Don’t make me beg to God
Don’t harden my heart
Don’t ask about me
I’ve let myself slide
But I hope I’ll be alright
