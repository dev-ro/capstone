Okay.
Welcome to the McConnell
Unit State Prison.
It's my job to inform you
that while you are here,
you are going to refer to us
as Mr. and Mrs.
Correctional Officer.
Simple rules for navigating
this place might be
don't tell anybody
your business,
stay in your lane,
keep to yourself.
Do that, you should be fine.
The state has decided
that you have lost
your chance out there.
That's why you are here.
And as long as you are here,
just remember you belong to us.
This is it.
Turn around and face the wall.
Hands behind the head.
Don't put him in here Dowdeny.
I'll take his eyes out.
He's bluffing.
- We're coming in.
- I told you!
You told me what?
Turn around, Caleo.
Top bunk's yours, Gonzalez.
I can see the
evil in your eyes.
Caleo, If you start something.
Yeah, yeah, Dowdeny, I know.
If I fuck this
I'm going to solitary, right?
That fucking sink
right there, is mine.
You understand?
You even want to shit, you ask.
He's not gonna
last one day in here.
Nope.
Everybody has their day.
Can I get a set in?
Keep moving, mother fucker.
You don't belong here.
Shit, look at him, he's
picking up cigarette butts.
Do you guys got a light?
Are you lost?
Do you know where you're at?
You seeing this, man?
Hey man, you need
a light or what?
I got you.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of
our death, amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee,
blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,
and at the hour of death, amen.
Hey.
You up, bendejo?
What's up?
In County somebody gave me
some words of wisdom once,
they said, in order
to survive in here,
you need to learn
how to lose a fight.
Never snitch, borrow or steal.
Always roll with somebody
and don't associate
with any homosexuals.
Here.
What's this?
- Call your novia.
- I don't have a novia.
So then call your
fucking boyfriend,
tell him to send you some money.
I don't want you're
fucking help, man.
Take it.
You don't owe me anything.
When you want commissary,
just get me something
when they send you
some money, that's it.
Lights are
out, keep it down!
You better not
snore tonight either.
You're the one
who fucking snores.
How's mija, Mamma?
She misses you.
Tell her I love
her, por favor.
Okay.
Tell her now, please.
Mama, has Julio
come near the house?
Once or twice.
Has any of those
been near the house?
Why are you silent?
Mama, I don't want any of
those people around the house.
It's Julio,
he's your cousin.
Mama, you know what he does.
- Okay, mijo.
- Okay, Mama.
- Mommy?
- Hmm?
God bless you, mijo.
Gracias, Mama.
What the fuck
are you doing, man?
Shh, keep it down.
You want to make
some money or what?
- You gonna cook, ese?
- No.
Real men know how to
cook, I could teach you.
It's a business.
You need a connect
in the kitchen.
You take the orders, I make it,
Sal takes care of the rest.
Ah.
You need to be in the kitchen.
That's where you need to be.
This shit smells
disgusting, man.
Come on, try it.
You go.
Last time I took this,
I was taking shit all day.
That shit is disgusting.
Everything is looking beautiful.
Attention on F
block, attention on F block,
officer Harris, officer R Harris
report to center now, please.
Gonzalez.
Back to work, mija.
Chop, chop.
Of course, what do you think?
Sleeps in the bunk above me,
he's rolling with me.
But you know what?
This little bird flew
by my hair yesterday
and told me
just popped up in
County yesterday.
You know what's interesting?
Don't worry, I'll have my people
look out after him for you.
Hmm?
Today's your lucky
today, pendejo.
Tomorrow might not be.
Alonso tells me that you're
covering for him tonight.
I need you to pick up Adriana.
You know she's special to me.
Mi diosa.
I need you to take care of her.
Bring her home safe.
Okay?
And I don't need
the fucking mafiosos
finding out about her either.
You remember what
happened to primo Arturo?
Pendejo.
They chopped his
cock off with pliers
and they shoved it in his mouth.
Then they shot him
up with adrenaline,
so he wouldn't fall asleep.
Then they started
cutting off his face
and they sewed it
to a soccer ball.
Lil ninos kicked that ball
around all day long all day.
All day.
Just because we're familia,
it doesn't mean
you're safe, cabron.
You're early today.
Where's my regular driver?
Alonso couldn't come.
And he lets you drive his car?
He's my cousin.
Right.
And how do you know Julio?
No, no, no, wait, let me guess.
He's your cousin too.
Everybody in this town
it's related, I swear.
You need something?
You got a cigarette?
Lifesaver.
You don't seem like
the type of guy
to associate with these dudes.
That's because
you don't know me.
These men are
going to trap you
and they're going to make
sure that you end up dead
or in jail.
Remember that.
I'm not like that.
I can feel that.
Julio's house then?
I guess so.
Somewhere else
you'd rather be?
There's plenty of
places I'd rather be.
You got everything?
No bread?
Cabron.
Good job.
Is this okay, like this?
What the
fuck are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- Give me this.
Mija, you hold it with the
knuckle down, entender?
And then you cut, you see?
No fingers, dickhead, see?
I know a chef that
has three fingers
and another one
has four fingers.
You want to be the guy
with the second finger?
I just want one finger.
That one you can
stick up your ass.
Put your hands up.
Like this?
And your legs.
Square up.
Now, sit down, stay
there, when you come up.
- Okay.
- All right?
All right, sit down, square
up and I'm gonna push you.
- Okay.
- Come back in.
- Have that punch.
- Like this?
There you go, just like that.
Left punch, now the right punch.
Now the right punch,
plant that foot down.
Go left punch again.
- Almost, focus, huh?
- Mmhmm.
Left punch.
Left, punch.
Punch, punch, punch, now push.
Push.
Push.
Nice, so give me another punch.
Push.
Come on, push.
Come on, push!
Come on, push!
Let's go, push.
Push, push.
Keep working on that, huh?
Listen, I'm not gonna
be here forever, carbon.
You're gonna break
hearts outs there.
You're gonna get more pussy
than the Humane Society, cabron.
I used to get bullied
for just being handsome.
But now at least I got
something else, right?
Defend yourself, yeah,
defend that pretty face.
You keep working on it, yeah?
Hey, what's up man?
How you doing?
Yeah, so I got three quarts
for $20 this weekend.
All right, I'll see you bro.
Yeah.
Three quarts for 22?
Two or three?
I'll get two.
I'll get it for
the game tonight.
All right, I'll see you.
Easy pendejo,
you'll pop the bag.
Ah, just fucking
with you, pendejo.
Yay.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
Hey.
Here, drink this.
What is this?
You know that shit they
give you when you're sick?
This shit's better.
Hey.
You ever gonna tell me what
got you to end up in here?
I was just driving
for the mafiaos.
I drive the girls to work.
I drive them home.
There was this one girl.
She wasn't like everyone else.
I liked her.
But she was off limits.
She was the mafiaos.
Yeah.
Julio would kill us.
If he saw us here, he would.
He cares about me is all.
- Mmhm.
- He does.
And I care about him.
At least we're drunk, no?
I love your eyes.
You don't know, do you?
I think you're fine.
You think I'm fine?
I've seen you around, a
couple times actually.
Yeah?
Who's this?
La nuna, she's the
daughter of light.
Makes sense.
I asked Alonso to drive for you.
'Cause I wanted to
hang out with you.
Well we're hanging.
Are you sure?
Adriana!
Adriana, wake up.
Adriana, wake up.
Adriana, wake up.
Are you okay?
Oh my God, your friend
looks real hurt.
I called 911.
She died instantly.
I got called
I got to live with that for
the rest of my life, you know?
I haven't stopped
praying since then.
Shit man, that shit can
happen to any one of us, man.
Hey.
And Julio?
He'll come looking for me.
But if I see him
first, I'll be ready.
Are you okay with
about Adriana?
You don't got to be
embarrassed in front of me, man.
You stay long here long enough,
you can't tell the difference
between a man and a woman.
And God said,
"Let there be lights
in the expanse of the heavens
to separate the
day and the night
and let them be for
signs and for seasons
and for days and years
and let the lights in the
expanse of the heavens
give light upon the earth.
We all start this
journey in darkness,
in our mother's wombs.
People were there loving us,
waiting for us.
And God sees us.
And the light is coming
and that light is the hope
in the place where we are today.
All right cell N,
this is a lock down.
Lock down.
This is a lock down.
East wing's secure.
They're going to
be there for awhile.
- When are you getting out?
- I can't say.
- You don't know?
- I didn't say that.
I said, I can't say.
Listen
never ever say when you're
getting out in here.
These pendejos will do anything
to keep you right
locked up in here.
How 'bout you?
What are you gonna
do when you get out?
Oh man, I'm getting
Marisa right away.
Yeah,
my baby girl.
She's deaf.
So we communicate
through sign language.
I'm gonna travel with
her so many places.
We're gonna be like getting out
of the city, of the country,
I've never been out, you know?
Always stuck in this place.
- Hmm.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna see snow.
You want to see snow?
Si, I'm gonna drive up.
She would play with
it, you know, eat it,
just throw it,
make angels, all of that shit.
Yeah.
I've never seen snow either.
Yeah.
There you go.
That's for ice lake.
Oh, this was fun.
Yeah, snow.
Everybody cell
N, this is a lockdown.
Can I ask you something?
It depends.
You said that after
a while in here,
you can't tell the difference
between a man and a woman.
Where you going with this?
What did you mean about that?
I meant that I liked you
better when you were quiet.
How long were you
here before you started
doing stuff like that?
Why do you want
to know about that?
I told you
everything about me.
Three years.
Your last cell mate?
Alex.
You ever loved one
of your brothers?
They just get you.
They don't fuck with your head.
They're not moody.
They don't disrespect.
They don't expect too much.
Just enough.
That's it.
Yeah.
I know that.
With Adriana, who did what?
She did it to me.
Did you do it back?
No.
Fuck, man.
I bet she was tighter than any
,
that feels good.
Alex, he tried to beat me down.
Always complimenting
me and shit.
Trying to rub my shoulders.
Till one day it just made sense.
We made love.
And I discovered
that the man that I was
dealing with all these years
was my brother.
I love her.
All in one.
You got to act
tough in this place.
Sometimes.
Just sometimes all you want
to do is just surrender.
To be touched.
No, no wait, wait.
But we can't do it here.
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you safe?
Yeah, yeah.
I got tested already.
Me too.
Gonzalez!
Kneel down and face the wall.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Hey.
What's up, what's going on?
- Where you going?
- Is that it?
Gotta go, mijo.
Don't forget what I told you.
Are you coming back,
are you coming back?
Are you coming back?
Let's go.
Martinez, one second,
one second, please.
Let's go.
- Please.
- Gonzalez.
Please put your hands
behind your head.
Gonzalez, put your
hands behind your head!
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
what the fuck was that, man?
Make sure your
driver licenses is in there.
Medication.
Good luck out there,
you're a free man.
Thank you.
The
number you have dialed
has been disconnected or
is no longer in service.
I thought she was
staying with you, Arnaud.
No she's
staying with Julio.
- Since when?
- Since your mom died.
Before that even.
What's his number?
Ah man, you let him?
Yo, what the
fuck you want me to do?
And Julio took her,
it's out of my hands.
Where's he staying?
He's got
places across the Valley.
I don't even see Julio
anymore, no one does.
I wouldn't go fuck
with him, man.
Operator.
Yes, can you piece up the
member of a shop in Lynn County?
Can you give me the list
of all of them, please?
I'm ready.
Thank you.
Hey!
Where's Carlos?
He's in the back.
Let me take a
look at you, man.
Man, I know I fucked you over
and I know I fucked
you over real good.
I deserve the
worst, I know that.
You just rolled up without
saying a fucking word.
You got me fucked up, man.
Everything that you warned
me about, you did it.
You lied.
You borrowed.
You stole.
Yeah.
That's right.
I did all that shit.
You're not even
fucking worth it.
You came here to kick my ass?
Mijo, you came here to kick
my ass you fucking punk!
You fucking.
You fucking punk!
You fucking punk! Huh!
Do it you fucking bitch, do it!
Where'd you learn that bullshit?
It's been three years.
Sal left right after you left.
I had to defend myself.
I knew the time
was coming, man.
I didn't know how
to fucking face you.
I did what I always do.
I fucking ran, man.
I fucking ran.
And for that, I'm sorry.
How'd you even find me man?
I must have called
every shop in Lynn County.
You did that?
For me?
Where you staying?
No where.
Home?
Mama?
Marisa?
Why don't you come
to my house tonight?
You can spend the night with us.
We'll figure it out from there.
Damn.
Was beginning to think
you weren't gonna show.
Come in.
Amen.
This fideo looks good.
Thank you.
It reminds me of what
I used to eat fideo
when I was a kid.
Mijo, how does
it feel to be free?
Surreal.
Like I still think that
ICO is going to come
and take me back to jail.
No, brother.
That's not gonna happen.
I hope.
How did you two meet?
He fixed my car.
And then you two fall in love?
So easy to fall in love
with this guy, huh?
I'm sorry, senora.
I'm excited to be here.
I had a long day.
I'm just gonna go
off to my room.
I'm going to go help this
to his room.
Good night.
She's very nice.
I know it.
I know we used to make
hooch and all back then
but you got lay down
on the drinking.
Okay?
Good night.
Where's your friend?
He's got a hangover.
He drinks too much.
- He's thirsty.
- So do you.
I'm thirsty too.
Where are you going?
Take a friend with you.
- Which one?
- Both of them.
Doesn't he have a home?
No.
Mama, somewhere to go?
Family?
Mijo, this is your house.
You make the rules.
I make the rules?
Get rid of one of them.
Wake up.
You slept the whole day away.
Oh, come on!
Come on babe, I
got to go to work.
Get up, please.
You're not going to work.
I don't know where you're
going, but it's not work.
What?
Goddammit, what the
hell's wrong with you?
What do you mean,
what's wrong with me?
I work nights, we have
different schedules.
You didn't
work last night.
Still, I'm used
to that schedule.
And you know what?
Nevermind.
There's just no point in
explaining anything to you.
You're so stupid.
Stupid?
You're eating my food
and you're acting like-
- Don't call me a bitch.
Hey, relax, all right?
I didn't and you
know I wouldn't.
- What?
- Last night.
What are you talking about?
Sometimes you get drunk and
you say a little bit too much.
What the fuck are
you talking about?
You know what
I'm talking about.
No, tell me.
Tell me.
Do you really
want me to say it?
Hey, Hey, hey!
Tell me what you think
I said last night.
Let go of my arm or
I'll scream so loud
so your mother here
where her son does
when he's been without
a woman for too long.
If only your father
could see his son now.
Ay, ay, ay!
That's right.
Look, I know
you're not the one
who likes to talk
about your feelings.
Especially if it involves me.
But back when we were
locked up, what was that?
- Was what?
- Come on, man.
Don't act like you don't
know what I'm talking about.
Look
I just don't like walking around
telling people my
business, that's all.
One minute, you're my boy.
The next, you're in my bunk.
That shit is confusing, no?
It's confusing to me too.
Hey, I do it to women too.
So don't take it personal.
Look, I'm here.
I came for you, right?
You know that,
but my little girl needs me too.
I need your help.
What do you want me to do?
Can I stay here until I can
figure out what to do next
about Marissa?
Of course you can stay.
You're not gonna go
there by yourself.
Look,
you give me the word,
and we go.
- Okay?
- All right.
I got a surprise for you.
Come on.
- No, I'm good.
- Come on.
I have a headache.
Come on,
chop chop, come on.
I'm good, I'm good.
Mijo, come on.
Come on, let's go!
You're gonna love this.
Sal!
Surprise, surprise motherfucker!
No shit, motherfucker!
You didn't tell me
you were bringing this
,
when you said you had a
surprise for me holmes,
I thought you were going to
bring me a hoagie or something.
What's a hoagie?
This motherfucker, good
looking motherfucker!
He fucking hasn't
changed, huh?
Same innocent pendejo.
Hey, check this shit
out over here, man.
Oh Sal, what's this?
Ooh.
- Wow.
- I called her Stella,
what do you think?
It's a little fixer
upper, you know?
Just killing some time.
You haven't done
enough of that already?
Apparently not, bro.
Hey, you guys want a beer
or something or what?
- Of course.
- Yeah, I'll grab a beer.
All right, come on.
You guys want to
get freaky or what?
What do you have in mind?
Shit, I don't know,
I got some mushrooms
in the freezer.
Now you're talking
my language now.
No, I don't fuck with
that shit, I'm cool.
All right, but you got to
flush all that shit away holmes.
What do you mean?
Prison, you've got
to sell on everything
that got you there.
Man, you got to flush
all that shit away.
What makes you
think they need that?
We all do, holmes!
Well, you're standing
a little higher, huh?
Coming back
from the dead, brother.
You're coming back
from the dead.
Are you feeling this yet?
Are you feeling this yet?
Are you feeling this yet?
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Is this what you
thought it would be?
No.
Not at all.
Better, worse?
I can't tell,
I can't tell yet.
Carlos, he loves you.
What.
If I had to say, I would
say that you love him too.
Pendejo, what are you doing?
I'll take a ride
back to town, sir.
Off we go!
Quickly, please!
Come on.
Back to the fire.
Motherfucker.
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha!
Shh.
You got a smoke?
Hey,
no.
Hey, if you ever need some cash,
I give you the keys to this
box and you take what you want.
I don't even know.
I want you to have it.
What?
I don't know, man.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
You never told me why
you went to McConnell.
Yeah.
Why we went to McConnell.
I was there for embezzlement.
For the shop?
No.
Not that shop, but another one.
You're ashamed
to tell me that?
I don't know.
I just
had to survive in there, man.
You know?
I had to create this persona.
And you had to do
the same thing.
Please leave
your message.
I need you to please
get me Julio's number.
If you can, his
address, por favor.
Call me back or just
if I don't answer,
just text it to me, por favor.
Bye.
Thank you.
Did your mama make
traditional tortillas
like that when you were little?
Yeah.
Where's your mama?
She's gone.
I don't know, I don't
know where he is.
You know, Carlos, he grew
up without his daddy too.
When he got in trouble,
it divided the family.
Neither side wants to fix it,
I guess it's going
to stay like that.
Everything can be talked about.
Men and their code and honor.
Do you know where
that word comes from?
No.
When the Spanish
invaded the natives,
the natives were obliterated.
The Spanish code of chivalry
and the native code of fidelity
were mangled by years of
insecurity, shame,
indignities,
to such a degree that
they weren't recognizable.
What we now call
is now but a hollow remanent
of who we once were,
does not teach men to be men.
It gives them a reason
to act like boys.
Hey.
If I go get another
six pack for us, huh?
I'm okay, I think
one is enough.
Okay, now twist it.
Yes, this is the original
way to make a tortilla,
you make a tostada.
You see how I'm working it
around my fingers like this?
Yes.
You're
flattening it out
and it has a center, see?
- Like this?
- It's a little tricky,
- but you're getting there.
- Yeah.
That looks perfect.
No, it's not perfect
but it is a tortilla.
Okay, now you can try it.
I can fit this on
the griddle now.
We'll cook this one and
then we'll cook that one.
Would you like a
crispy tortilla?
- Sure.
- With butter?
See, this is very crispy.
I want to listen to people.
To God.
Most importantly, to myself.
And I owe it all to you.
I think we can be together.
Do you want the same thing too?
I want that too.
I need a new house.
You'll be fine right here.
We'd be two dads, right?
Yeah.
We'd be two dads.
Hmm.
I always wanted that.
A family.
I didn't feel worth it before.
But I am now.
I want my little girl to,
to know me like this.
Not the man that I was before.
Then let's go get her, man.
Ruben,
I'm ready.
Sal's gonna help.
I don't you involved in that.
If you're involved,
I'm involved.
Hello?
Primo.
Where are you?
I hear you've been
looking for me.
I know where you are, Julio.
Well then let's talk.
Man to man.
We'll talk.
No hombre, I
think you know better
than to come out this way.
It's not your home anymore.
- Can I use the computer?
- Of course.
Where you going?
I need to take
care of something.
So I got you-
You in?
Mijo?
Mama, you seen Ruben?
Came in about an
hour ago and left.
Where?
I'm not sure.
Mama, you don't understand.
He's not coming back.
You don't know that.
Fuck him! Fuck him!
There are things
he needed to do
and he did not want
you to be a part of it.
He did not want to involve
you and I appreciate that.
Appreciate that, Mama?
You appreciate that?
I wouldn't take him if he comes
begging through that door.
Oh, mijo.
That man loves you.
He cleans up after you.
He does your laundry.
He hangs on your every word.
Do you love him?
Do you love him?
Si, Mama.
He loves you too.
Let him take care of whatever
has to be taken care of.
No.
Stay.
Are you sure?
Please.
Go, please.
I love you.
Why!
Please, go, go.
Go baby, go.
Go.
I just get to get Mari.
That's not all
you came here for.
Don't do this man.
Julio.
All you had to do
was drive Adriana
from one place to another.
The family knew
you would fuck up.
But this was on a new level.
You hard now?
You macho?
Your mother, she asked me
to take care of Marisa.
I raised her like my own child
because you couldn't,
because you were a murderer.
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is!
I'm sorry, man.
Look.
I'm beat, I'm tired, man.
We were all wrapped up
in this mafioso shit.
This is not who we are, Julio.
Listen, I wanted her
to be just like you,
but I just want to
shine above all this.
Leave everything behind
and just have a decent life
for my daughter
and the man I love.
That's what I wanted.
Julio!
All right.
You can shoot me.
Shoot me.
Fire.
I found forgiveness, Julio.
And I think you can too.
I think about Adriana everyday.
Do it.
Promise me that you
will take care of Mari..
Fuck!
I thought you were dead.
Nice to meet you.
Beautiful.
