[in Polish]
I couldn't find anything decent.
New house, new wardrobe,
but it's still the same old mess.
[screams, in English]
What the hell are you doing here?
You're sick people. You know that?
[in Polish] You deviants!
Freaks! Filthy perverts!
[in English] Massimo,
you have to get out of here!
It brings bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding.
Not to say to bang her
and ruin her makeup!
[in Polish] You're driving me crazy.
You'd give Grandma Krysia a heart attack.
- [in English] Are you jealous?
- Listen to me.
Please have some respect
for Polish tradition, okay?
If you want, next time you can join us.
Go, go, go!
Adiós, amigos. Ciao, bella!
[in Polish] Or whatever you people say.
[in English] See you later, alligator!
[sighs]
[exhales]
[in Polish] It was supposed to be perfect.
The wedding, the dress, and you.
And I was supposed to be relaxing.
[sighs]
[lighter clicks]
Just look at you. [scoffs]
I'm not gonna get on your ass about it,
but you never smoke.
Whatever. If you wanna pretend
to be a badass, fine.
[Laura scoffs]
[Olga] But I need to know something.
You haven't told him, have you?
Okay. None of my business.
You've been trying
to tell him, though, right?
I think about it every day.
Massimo can never know I was pregnant.
[Olga] That's great.
A dark secret is the foundation
of any successful relationship.
[Laura] What should I do?
Tell him I lost the baby
in the tunnel where I almost died?
Do you know what he'd do?
What?
[Laura] These people aren't normal.
A war would break out.
[scoffs] A war? Come on.
You know Massimo.
He never lets things go.
Know what a "vendetta" is?
[Olga] Mm-hmm.
You do realize we're in Sicily, right?
I mean, I've heard the word before.
In movies. Who hasn't?
Of course I know what it means.
Oh shit.
I wasn't thinking.
[Laura sighs softly]
It was the hardest decision of my life.
I'm sorry.
[sighs]
You're the strongest woman I've ever met.
You know that?
Remember, you're not alone.
I'm here for you.
[Laura sighs]
So, do you love him?
[chuckles]
Okay, let's go.
Help me get ready.
I promise I won't forget
my panties this time.
Here you go. Pick any color you like.
What am I saying? They're all white.

Nope.

[energetic music playing]
[Olga, in Polish] Shit.
[music fades out]
[in Italian] Shit.
[Olga, in Polish] You changed your hair!
[in English] Welcome home!
[in Polish] Nice to see you too.
I didn't know we had to bring food.
[Olga] Listen...
I'm living my best life. I fell in love.
And when exactly did that happen?
You're the last person
who should be criticizing me.
I'm wondering how many pieces
of furniture I'll need to replace.
Would you be so kind as to make a list
of everything that's been tainted?
Want a raspberry?
In Italian, it's called "lampone."
[Laura] You can stick your lampone
up your ass.
[in English] I would like to propose
you two catch up in a different location
'cause Domenico,
now he needs to focus on work.
Of course, when he's wearing
a normal suit and not...
What is that, a... a cake or something?
[in Italian] Cream.
[in English] Um,
I arranged a little trip for you two.
Do I look like furniture
that you can move around?
- I want you to have fun with your friend.
- Oh, really?
- It's not a joke.
- [Laura] Why don't you put a leash on me?
Oh, I can see honeymoon is over.
[in Polish] Shut up.
Calm down. We could use a vacation.
It's been so long,
I've forgotten what alcohol looks like.
- [in Italian] I'll be in the office.
- All right.
[in Polish] What's on your mind?
Nothing. I'm just enjoying being here.
- Is that why you're acting so serious?
- [Laura] I'm not.
I just feel bad about Massimo.
He's making a real effort.
He arranged this trip.
Sometimes I think I'm just like my mom.
[Olga] Uh-uh.
Nope. Even worse. You're a typical wife.
[both chuckle]
Thanks, Olga. I can always count on you.
No worries. Happy to help.
Listen. It's simple, really.
You know what Massimo likes,
so just do that.
Oh shit!
I've got an idea.

[in Polish] Remember how we met?
No.
Remember your mom hanging out the window
with a plate in her hand?
[both, drawn out] Mom!
[Olga] How old were we back then? Six?
Mm-hmm. Even back then,
you had powder on your plate.
[both laugh]
Hey! It was just powdered Jell-O.
We ate it with our fingers
and went roller-skating. Remember?
[Olga] Ah.
Honestly? I prefer life now,
20 years later.
My skates weren't as fast as the Ferrari.
Not for lack of trying.
You know what?
What?

Forever.

[in Italian] Hi there! [sighs]
[in Polish]
I guess we're not having dessert.
[in English] We're leaving.
[in Polish] Did you hear that?
[in English] I said... we're leaving.
Don Massimo Torricelli,
I have needs.
I know that our beginnings
were quite rough,
or more like sick.
You've kidnapped me, and this is sick.
But I fell in love with you,
and we are together because I decided.
You cannot control people,
and I won't let you control me.
- I'm your wife, not one of your soldiers.
- What are you talking about?
- I just want to protect you.
- [Laura] This is not protection.
This is prison.
I can't live without doing anything.
I miss challenges.

[Laura] Nacho?
Nacho. Nice to meet you.
You have a nice cap.
[chuckles] Yes, I know. Thank you.
[Laura] But Nacho?
It doesn't sound very Italian.
It's a nickname.
My family has Spanish roots.
And you? Where are you from?
Poland.
Thirsty?
[Nacho] Oh, yes.
Thank you.
How long have you been working
for my husband?
[Nacho] I just started.
Mr. Torricelli wants
some changes in the garden.
I have to work.
I wouldn't like to waste
your precious time.
Wasting my time?
You're talking to a person
who has absolutely nothing to do.
Now my only job is being a... wife.
How pathetic is that?
[chuckles]
You're wrong, missus.
Being a good wife is one
of the most difficult jobs in the world.
[Laura] Oh.
[scoffs] It's why I'm so perfect at it.
'Cause I don't have to do anything.
They cook for me. They clean for me.
Even they cut flowers for me.
It's why I'm so perfect at doing nothing.
You are a real busy bee.
That's a great talent.
To be perfect without doing anything.
[chuckles] Please don't tell me
that you also make money by doing nothing.
Where do you think it all comes from?
[chuckles]
You need to teach me that.
[woman] Mrs. Torricelli!
I must go. Thank you for the water.
Ah. I will cut some flowers for you.
It was a pleasure, Laura from Poland.
It was a pleasure, Nacho the gardener.

the arrival of my parents.
It was a wonderful gift.
[softly] Anything for you.
Don't you miss your family?
Because, besides Domenico,
you have nobody.
You had Mario.
It was Mario's own decision to retire.
I didn't make him do it.
He couldn't deal with...
After the accident,
he was blaming himself for what happened,
but I know that he couldn't do anything.
But... he's a man of honor.
And I've lost my right hand.
Yeah.
I know how important he was in your life.
Sometimes I think that, uh,
you feel so lonely...
'cause besides me, you have no one.
No parents, no siblings.
I have a brother.
But I'd rather not have him.
But... correct me if I'm wrong...
Do we still have something to try out?
You have a brother?
And you didn't tell me about this before?
I still have some work to do.
No, do not tell me

[Laura] You know what?
You've been married for 30 years,
and I wish Massimo looked at me
the same way Dad looks at you.
Sweetie, you need to understand
that marriage is about compromise.

[quietly] My God.
How could he be so stupid? And with her?
I wish I could go away from here

I'm flying home in a few hours.

[in Polish] Mom, I'm sorry.
You were right.
I was wrong about Massimo.
After what I saw, I don't want
to see him ever again. Obviously.
I need to get away
for a while and collect my thoughts.
Don't worry about me. I'm safe.
I love you. I'll call in a few days.

Wow, you look great.
I like you in this outfit.
I took what I found in the closet.
Maybe it's your girlfriend's?
I think she prefers a sporty style.
Sister's.
I don't have a girlfriend, Laura.
These are my sister's clothes.
Come.
Dinner is ready.
Look what I made for you.
My favorite dish.
- Paella.
- But dinner?
Did I sleep so long?
It's so nice here.
It's my father's house.
Anyway, my sister Amelia
will come by later.
I think you will like each other.
She's a cool girl.
She's a bit moody.
You know,
pregnancy hormones.
[high-pitched ringing]
Your sister is pregnant. I'm sorry.
Oh.
Are you okay?
It's just a pity
she chose an asshole for the father.
Wait a moment.
I have to clean.
[Klara, in Polish] I'm gonna kill him!
Excuse me. Leave me alone!
[in Italian] Let her through.
[in English] I have no idea where she...
What did you do to her?
What did you do to my daughter?
She recorded a message
saying she was leaving you.
She never wants to see you again.
I knew you were a bad person
since I met you.
I don't know what you did to her,
but I know one thing.
If my daughter decided to leave you,
she has a damn good reason for it!
We are going back to Poland.
We'll wait for her to come home.
My husband is already in the car.
Don't try to stop me.
[in Italian] Bring me Davide and Tommaso.
Now.
Go!

You used to love the Sicilians.
That's even worse.
[kisses]
Wow.
I can see that your brother
takes care a lot about you.
Yeah, Nacho is wonderful. The best.
Just don't tell him
I said that. [chuckles]

Like you. He deserves it.
How do you know I'm nice? You just met me.
Intuition. It never disappoints me.
And there is something
between you two, I hope.
Oh, really?
But you know, my life got complicated,
so right now, I have to fix it.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
And you know
that Nacho worked for me as a gardener?
[Amelia] As a gardener?
Oh my God,
my brother will never cease to amaze me.
So, you didn't know
what he was doing in Sicily?
[Amelia] Honey, you can't keep up
with Nacho.
He's the most spontaneous person I know,
and he's also very loyal to his family.
Maybe too loyal sometimes.

and eternal rival
of your husband's family.
So, your father told you
to bring me to the island?
No. You came here because you wanted to.
What if I didn't want to?
I would've found a way.
[Laura] Fuck.
I was so naive.
I thought that you were my real friend
and nothing was a coincidence.
Laura, I wasn't faking
my feelings for you.
So I guess I have to thank you.
'Cause you proved that men aren't good.
Only good at lying.
You think I would fake all of this?
Take you to the beach?
Teach you to surf?
And the kiss?
You didn't feel it was real?
It was real, like a fairy tale.
And if you think I would fall in love
again with a guy who thinks
he can have me just like that,
you're absolutely wrong.
'Cause I've learned from my mistakes,
and I've learned
that you're a fuckin' liar.
Laura.

[Nacho] Be rational.
I didn't make you come here.
You came with me because you felt safe.
No.
You ruined everything since the moment
you hid the truth from me.

you are the wife of a Mafia boss.
You know how important
the loyalty is for the family.
When the Mob boss is your father,
you don't have much choice.

Thank you for accepting
the invitation to the meeting.

Oh, I would like to apologize
that we are meeting
in such unpleasant circumstances,
but I believe that, as a businessman,
you will understand
that the goal justifies the means.
After all, the stakes are high.

He knew that no opponent
should be taken lightly.
I cannot bear...
more chances with you as a boss.
All the families
would benefit from someone more, uh,
controllable to be in your place.
We figured your stupid brother
will do perfect.
He's so blinded with revenge and greed
