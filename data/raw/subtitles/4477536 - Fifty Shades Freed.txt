CHRISTIAN:
Hey, Ros, what's up?
I'm-I'm sorry to interrupt
your honeymoon.
We had a fire in the main
server room this morning.
- Was anyone injured?
- No.
And the damage
could have been much worse.
The fire suppression system
kicked in.
It looks like arson.
Someone planted
an explosive device.
This guy.
Security is sweeping the room
for fingerprints and DNA.
Did he get any data?
He took some of your
personal files, and then he
might have set the fire
to cover his tracks.
Uh, can you go back?
ANASTASIA:
Oh, my God.
That's Jack.
ROS:
Who's Jack?
Jack Hyde,
formerly of S.I.P.
- ANASTASIA: Uh, he was my boss.
- Uh-huh.
Not anymore.
He's been dealt with.
I'm sorry, we need to go home.
Ros, can you tell Andrea
I need the jet
in Nice tomorrow, please?
Got it.
I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Grey.
Oh, don't be.
Why would Jack do that?
It's insane.
[sighs]
What?
I got a report from the FAA.
They don't think
that the helicopter crash
was an accident.
They said it looks
like sabotage.
Sabotage?
Why wouldn't you tell me that?
I didn't want you to worry.
You think Jack did that, too?
Why would he be going
to these lengths?
[sighs] I don't know.
But don't worry.
I swore I'd keep you safe,
and I will.
[indistinct announcement

Linc.
Grey.
Hello.
This is my wife, Anastasia.
- Ah, Mrs. Grey.
- Hi.
Congratulations.
- [Christian clears throat]
- Thank you.
And good luck.
What was that?
Never mind.
Tell me.
It's Elena's ex.
Mr. Robinson?
Yes.
He doesn't like me very much.
[laughs]
I could tell.
[Anastasia laughing]
CHRISTIAN:
Ana, that's not funny.
- Hey. [clears throat]
- Oh, uh...
Mr. and Mrs. Grey,
welcome home.
- Hi, Gail.
- Thank you.
Uh, Sawyer, ma'am.
Hello. Hi.
This is my colleague, Prescott.
- Hi.
- Just Sawyer and Prescott?
- That's it?
- Keep it simple.
They'll be in charge
of your personal security.
Oh.
Both of you?
We'll mostly take turns,
Mrs. Grey.
You won't even know we're here.
That seems unlikely,
but thank you.
[Christian and Anastasia
chuckle]
- Come on.
- Can I get you something to eat
- before I unpack your bags?
- I'm good.
Anastasia?
Some tea, perhaps?
Yeah. Yes. Thank you.
I mean, please and thank...
and thank you.
[Christian chuckles]
- I'll be in my office.
- Okay.
Laters, baby.
GAIL:
Now, when you have a moment,
we should discuss how you'd
like to run the household.
Run the household?
The dinner menus,
- the wine list, uh, the flowers.
- Oh.
And what changes
you'd like made to the decor.
Um...
I-I know it's a lot
to take in, Mrs. Grey.
There's no rush.
Can't you just call me Ana?
Well, Mr. Grey likes
to be called Mr. Grey,
so that would be a little odd.
Right. Okay.
Now, what would you like
for tonight?
I have boeuf bourguignon...
Actually, I was kind of
thinking that maybe
I could just cook dinner
for Christian tonight.
Mrs. Grey.
I'm so sorry. You prob...
I don't want to mess up
your plans. I'm sorry.
Mrs. Grey, this is your home.
[chuckling]:
This is your kitchen.
You don't need
to ask permission.
Now, why don't I show you
what's in the fridge,
and you can take it from there.
Perfect. [chuckles]
Perfect timing.
Where's Gail?
I gave her the night off.
Sit.
[Christian sighs,
Anastasia chuckles]
Medium rare,
just how Sir likes it.
I could get used to this.
Well, we're kind of married,
so you might have to.
I mean you in my kitchen.
- Mm.
- You mean barefoot and pregnant?
[Christian clears throat]
That was a joke.
Yeah.
I'm assuming it wasn't
the "barefoot" part
that made you nearly choke
on your food.
You do want to have kids
someday, right?
Someday, sure.
You don't really sound sure.
[sighs]
You know what I am sure about?
Hmm?
That's great steak.
Christian.
Do you not want to have kids?
Of course.
One day, just not now.
I'm not ready to share you
with anyone.
[Christian chuckles]
Mrs. Grey.
Thank you.
[quiet chatter]
Hey, Brendan.
Morning, Miss Steele.
- WOMAN: Welcome back, Miss Steele.
- Hi.
[gasps quietly]
Ana.
Nice of you to join us.
Hi, Liz.
Am... am I in the right office?
We had a makeover.
Mr. Roach wanted to welcome
the new fiction editor.
Who's the new fiction editor?
You are.
You got a promotion.
I got a promotion?
And you weren't even here.
Ana!
- Hi, Hannah.
- [chuckling]: Hi.
ANASTASIA:
Hi.
- HANNAH: Hi. Welcome back.
- [cell phone chimes]
- How do you like your new digs?
- Amazing.
I'm gonna let you
get settled in.
And, Ana, good luck.
Not that you need it.
So...
who is that beautiful man?
ANASTASIA: Oh, that's Sawyer,
my personal security.
Oh.
I know.
It's very, very fancy.
Um, can we find a spot for him?
I might have an opening.
- Hannah!
- [laughing]: What?
Down, girl.
Uh, everything's
in relatively the same spot.
Oh, and I asked I.T.
to change your e-mail.
Because they still have you
as Ana Steele
instead of Ana Grey.
Oh.
Um, l-let's just leave it
- for a while.
- Done.
And Boyce Fox is in town.
I have penciled him in
for 11:00.
- Amazing. Awesome.
- [laughs]
- Thank you. Thanks, Hannah.
- Yeah.
Oh, wait, hold on.

Thank you.
It's good to have you back, Ana.
It's good to be back.

Hi. How can I help you?

Now, when am I gonna see pages

Already?
Um, well, I've written

Um, Boyce, this is my husband,

- Pleasure to meet you.
- Absolutely.
Do you mind?
I need a word
with Miss Steele here.
Uh, no. Actually, no, we're
not... we're not finished.
Uh, you know, I'm just gonna
grab a coffee real quick.
It was nice to meet you.
[door closes]
Good-looking guy.
Seriously, Christian?
You're vetting my authors now?
I tried e-mailing you.
It bounced.
There's no Anastasia Grey
at S.I.P.
I know.
Ana Steele is the name
I use at work.
And I know you're gonna say
I don't need to work,
but I can't stay home
and-and do lunches
and choose wallpaper.
I would lose my mind.
I work because I love my job.
Understood.
But you can't love it
as Ana Grey?
I need to have
my own identity here.
People already think I got
to where I am because of you.
But you didn't.
You got this
through hard work and talent.
Why does it matter
what you call yourself?
Who gives a shit
what people think?
Well, apparently, you do.
Would you change your name
for me?
Yes.
If it meant that much to you.
Okay.
I'll think about it.
You will?
Yeah.
That's how this works,
remember?
Talk, listen...
work stuff out.
Now, get lost.
I gotta find my author.
And you need to shave.
[chuckles]
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
I might not be done by then.

You afraid that your hot

Yeah. [chuckles]

How's Elliot? What's going on?
He's busy.
He's working
on this big eco project
with that architect Gia Matteo.
The one with the really big...
Plans. Yeah, huge plans.
And, boy, does Elliot like
to look at those plans.
No.
- He adores you, Kate.
- I don't know.
I just... I have this feeling.
Why don't you just ask him
straight up?
Honestly, I don't know
if I want to know the answer.
Whatever.
I hate that I even care
this much.
- No. No.
- Here you go.
Thank you.
Just keep 'em coming, will you?
And don't ever stop.
- Of course.
- [chuckling]: Thank you.
No, I really can't.
I'm gonna get
in so much trouble.
Look at you. You're so...
What?
Married.
I know. [chuckles]

Made my head spin.
It suits you.
Yeah, I think it does.

Elliot's taking us hiking.
- You coming?
- No.
I have work to do.
Come on.
Just a stroll in the hills.
When Elliot says "stroll,"
he means 20 miles
straight uphill with nothing
to eat but tree bark.
What if I run into a bear?
Mm, good luck to the bear.
ANASTASIA: What was Christian
like when he was little?
He doesn't ever really talk
about it.
It's a miracle he talks at all.
When Mom and Dad
first brought him home,
he never spoke.
He didn't cry.
I mean, he's never cried.
He did kick the crap out of me
a few times when Mom
wasn't looking, though.
Really?
You guys seem like
you're pretty close now.
Yeah, we've grown up a lot
since then.
Now I'm just in awe of him.
He's the bravest guy I know.
Nothing scares him.
You seem pretty fearless.
Me?
Nah.
What are you so afraid of?
Hey, Elliot, when is
this forced march gonna end?
I promised Ana
we'd go shopping.
Well, guess we could go back
through town.
I got some errands to run, too.
TAYLOR:
Sir.
This just came in.
More background on Hyde.
Went to Princeton
on a scholarship,
graduated summa cum laude.
Smart guy.
Worked for publishers
in New York and Chicago
before S.I.P.
[sighs] What else?
We tracked down
an ex-assistant.
Seems Hyde slept with her.
Made a sex tape,
used it to blackmail her.
Jesus.
Has she told the police?
She wouldn't go on record.
And another thing...
apparently, Hyde was
in and out of foster homes
in Detroit.
So was I.
Good work.
- Keep digging.
- Sir.
And, Taylor...
Ana's still shaken up.
Not a word about this for now.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes!

Hey, uh, Dr. Greene
called again,
and there is
a Detective Clark to see you.
CLARK:
I'm sorry, Mrs. Grey,
but my lieutenant asked me
to check something out.
Jack Hyde claims you and him
were sleeping together
when he worked at S.I.P.
- What?
- He tried to break it off,
you got upset,
and you made up this whole
sexual assault story
to get him fired.
- What?! -Says he came
to your apartment to try
and straighten things out,
but your security people
got involved
and it all went south.
No, that is complete bullshit.
I'll put that down as a denial.
- Jack attacked me.
- Right.
He attacked me,
and then he tried to kidnap me.
Do you believe
what he's saying?
Officially, Mrs. Grey,
it doesn't matter
what I believe.
Unofficially,
I believe Hyde
is a lying piece of shit
who will say anything
to get bail.
You need to be ready for that.
Thank you for your time.
Wait, Jack is applying
for bail?
Noon today,
municipal courthouse.
[door opens]
Does your client deny forcing
entry into this penthouse?
He does not, Your Honor.
However, my client
had exhausted all legitimate
means of redress
and merely wanted to confront
the parties responsible
for destroying his career.
I think he wanted to do more
than confront them, counselor.
These are not the actions of an
innocent man seeking redress.
However,
given his clean record,
the court will grant bail.
- Set at $500,000.
- Your Honor.
Next case.
Okay.
Let's go.

CHRISTIAN:
How'd it go today?
Uh, good. I got a visit
from Detective Clark.
[takes deep breath]
Apparently, Hyde is trying
to say that I came on to him.
He expects people
to believe that?
It's his word against mine.
Is that what's bothering you?
Ana, no one will believe him.
And the other assistants,
they'll tell the detectives
- he did the same...
- I'm pregnant.
Six or seven weeks.

I am not ecstatic, either,
given the timing
and your reaction.
But babies happen
when you have sex,
and you and I tend
to do a lot of that.
So we can either
do this together...
...or I will do it without you.
And what about us?
Well, when your husband prefers
the company of his ex-mistress,
it doesn't really say much
for your marriage, does it?
Elena and I just talked.
I was too angry with you.
I'm angry with you, Christian.
You left me.
You left me when I needed you.
You fucked up.
Yes, I fucked up,
and I'm sorry.
I'm standing here
telling you I'm sorry.
Okay, she doesn't...
she doesn't mean anything
to me.
I don't need her.
I need you.
Would have been good
if you felt that way yesterday.

NEWSMAN [on TV]:
Shares in Lincoln Industries
were suspended today
on news of a hostile takeover
by Seattle entrepreneur
Christian Grey.
The announcement came
on the same day
founder and CEO John Lincoln
was fired by his own board.
It's alleged Lincoln
misused company finances
- to post bail for one Jack Hyde,
- [reporters shouting]
currently under arrest
on charges
of kidnapping and extortion.
A spokesperson
for Grey Enterprises
said Lincoln Industries would
be broken up and its assets...

ANASTASIA: What is happening?
Are you cooking?
[grunting]:
Yeah. I got this.
Prepare to be amazed.
[chuckles]
Shit.
[Anastasia clears throat]
What's this?
CHRISTIAN:
It's more information on Hyde.
Open it.
Whoa.
Look at his foster family.
CHRISTIAN:
That's Hyde.
That's me.
You were in foster care
with him?
I must have been.
Do you remember these people?
Do you know these kids?
I barely remember anything
before I was adopted.
I was too young.
That must have been
what he meant
when he said
that you owe him a life.
Because your parents
adopted you and not him.
What's going on?
If I'd been left in the system,
who knows how I
would have turned out?
That could be me.
Maybe that should have been me.
Hey. No.
You are nothing like him.
[sighs]
You were given a life
with advantages, yes, but...
look what you made of it.
You're a man of honor.
And you treat people well.
You care.
No one could ever say that
about a man like Hyde.
No matter who raised him.
I love you.
Now, if you could only cook.
- You'd be perfect.
- Oh, God.
Okay.

Fuck it.

is buried.
