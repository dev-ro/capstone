No. No no no.
Just be quiet.
- Cameraman: Oh shit!
- Aw, man, fucking...
Shit. Shit. Shit.
- Shit.
- Man: Hey! Hey!
- Get the fuck back here!
- ( car door opens )
- Hey, give me that fucking camera!
- ( car starts )
-( bangs )
- ( tires screech )
Cameraman: Yeah, so you're
watching that footage I sent?
Man:
Yeah, I fucking saw it. You--
Cameraman: So as you probably guessed,
your wife hired me to get that.
My problem is if I show it to her,
she stops paying me.
So I was thinking you might want
to make a counter-offer there.
Oh, and whatever number
you come up with,
you can put 300 bucks on top
for the dent you put in my car.
-( Indistinct shouting )
- Well, you scratched the paint anyway.
You know what? If I don't hear from you
by tomorrow, your wife gets that file.
- Goodbye.
- ( phone beeps )
- So what's the deal now?
- Ah, probably nothing.
Just this woman thinks
her son is missing.
He hasn't been to class in a week.
He won't answer her calls.
He's probably passed out
in a pile of beer cans.
In which case we're gonna
take the kid on a road trip
and rack up some expenses, 'cause we're
getting 1,000 bucks a day on this one.
Turn left up here.
- Woman: Your button cam's working?
- Yeah, it's working.
Woman:
This is it?
Yeah.
Woman: It doesn't look like
anyone's home.
She couldn't give you a key?
She doesn't have one.
She said the lock
on the back window's busted,
so maybe we can get in that way.
- Woman: And the cops haven't been here?
- No, the cops don't give a shit
about some college kid
who's missing for a couple of days.
( Distant barking )
Man: Here.
- ( Metal clanks )
-( unzips )
- ( distant bang )
- Woman: ls there someone in there?
- ( Crowbar clanks )
- Here. Come on, give me the cam.
There's nothing there. See?
Woman: It sure as fuck
sounded like there's something in there.
Man:
It's an old house.
Besides, if there is somebody in there,
I'm gonna want to talk to 'em.
(whispers )
Here.
( Low rumbling, creaking )
Ow.
- Man: You all right?
- Ow.
Just great. Ow.
Man:
You okay?
( Static buzzing )
Woman: Huh.
- Man: Um...
- What?
You know what? Stay in here, okay?
I'm gonna go check
the rest of this apartment and make sure
no one else is in here, okay?
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.
All right, good.
Just-- just, um, pull anything
relevant onto the drive.
Okay? And record everything.
That was part of the deal.
She likes me to do that.
Well, you took my camera.
Man:
Oh. Then...
All right, so I'll be right back.
Just, um--
just-- I don't know,
see what's on that computer, okay?
If it's encrypted, we can take it home.
If not, just pull what you can.
Got it.
( Water dripping )
( rustling )
- Man on recording: Show her tits!
- ( woman crying )
( door creaks )
( man on computer sighs )
I found a new one.
It's third or fourth generation
from the quality.
L-- I got it from some guy
down in Little Armenia
with a pawn shop.
He is definitely not the type
of guy you usually see
on here trading with us,
but I think he's somebody
who's worth checking in on again.
(thrumming )
(thuds)
( hissing )
Okay.
That's fucking weird.
Man on computer:
Most of his collection, I would say,
was snuff and CP, but he had
at least one that was the real thing.
I don't even think
he knew what it was.
' Anyway...

A little bit of redness,
some irritation, but it looks okay.
- How's it working?
- Guy: It's good.
Um, yeah, I can see,
but what about my other eye?
- Follow.
- Okay.
(whirring )
You can't see anything
out of your biological eye?
- No.
- Okay.
How about now?
Yeah. I mean, it's a little better.
It's just kind of blurry and shadowy.
Yeah. All right.
Well, because your prosthesis is
attached directly to your visual cortex,
your real eye's essentially
battling with your camera eye
to give you input right now.
So when your brain gets used
to having that chip in there,
you should start to see more and more
out of your uninjured eye again.
Until then
you might see some glitches.
What do you mean by glitches?
Well, this is just being tested now.
Eye injuries like yours are quite rare.
So that's why we've installed
a recording chip
into the eye itself so we can
test the data that it's receiving.
Guy:
Right. Yeah, about that.
- Yes?
- Oh my God.
So if I want private time,
what do I do?
- How do I turn this off?
- Uh, well, you can't.
But that's just for this trial period.
I mean, you can't expect
the KPG Corporation
to just give you this implant
and not expect to test its data.
( Guy sighs )
Of course not.
So you guys are gonna sit around
and watch me take shits?
I'd say that's a fair compromise,
Mr. Middleton.
You can read a newspaper during,
or something.
- Mm-hmm.
- So make an appointment for next week.
We'll see how it's working.
Call me if you have any concerns.
All right.
Thank you.
( Man speaking on P.A. )
Middleton:
What the hell?
All right.
( Pop music playing

J' Fever, fever, fever... J'
- Middleton: All right, man.
- All right.
- Sure you gonna be okay, bud?
- Yeah, dude, I'm good. I'm good.
All right, give me a shout
if you need anything.

Oh shit.
Yeah. Yeah, I can tell
the difference
between a burst of light
and a fucking bloody person, okay?
I don't know, you tell me.
You're the doctor.
Look, I'm coming in there tomorrow
and you're gonna fix this fucking thing
and that's that, okay?
( Sighs )
Fine.
All right, thank you.

Hey, are you in there?
Look, I can see you
through the peephole.
Middleton: Weren't you
at the doctor's office yesterday?
Yeah.
Okay, so what's the deal?
Are you following me?
I'm not following you. I--
look, just open the door.
Middleton: All right, listen,
I don't mean to be rude,
- but it's kind of weird, you know?
- Look, are you seeing weird stuff?
Like people who look dead?
You should really open the door.
( Sighs )
Thank you.
I'm Clarissa.
Middleton:
Yeah, come on in.
- Clarissa: Nice place, man.
- Thanks.
Clarissa:
Do you have any beer?
Middleton: I do. Yes.
What about painkillers?
Did the doctor give you any?
No, I'm not actually in any pain.
I'll just take a beer then.
Look, Clarissa,
I'm actually on my way out of here.
Dude, you're not gonna get anywhere
if you don't hear what I have to say.
Just give me a beer,
get one for yourself.
You're gonna need it.
( Middleton sighs ) Right.
( Electronic hum )
- ( hisses )
- ( cap clattering )
- Thanks.
- Sure.
I was born deaf.
When I was 16
my parents put me up
for a new cochlear implant.
It worked, obviously.
But I began to be able to pick up
certain frequencies in my environments.
What happened
to your eye anyway?
(sighs)
I was in a, um--
in a car accident.
So who's the little girl?
Middleton:
What little girl?
There's a little girl here.
I heard her crying when I came in.
But you know...
I don't hear her now.
Some people never
hear them or see them--
maybe once in their entire lives,
if they're open to it.
So...
when you can sense them,
they know.
They can tell.
That's why I wanted to find you...
to warn you.
Middleton:
Warn me about what?
Yeah.
The more you interact with them,
the more they can
touch you,
hurt you,
stuff.
Middleton: Well, tomorrow
I'm gonna get this fuckin' thing
taken out of my head
and that'll be that, right?
Don't be so sure.
Have you ever done
anything bad to anybody?
Look, if you get
the implant taken out,
they're still gonna be there.
You're just not gonna
be able to see 'em.
I don't know,
maybe that's better.
Well, I guess-- oh shit!
Um, I don't want
to alarm you right now,
but there's a fucking creepy dude
standing right behind you.
I know. I can hear him.
- Do you know him or something?
- He was my uncle.
Oh, of course, right.
I mean--
well, I didn't mean to call him
creepy, but I mean--
- He wasn't a nice person.
- ( dance music playing )
Okay.
- Jesus.
- I know how to make him go away.
- Just focus on me.
- Okay.
Oh!
Holy shit.
( Chuckles )
No, don't look at him.
Look at me.
- ( Kissing )
- ( music continuing)
( music stops )
Oh.
Oh shit.
All right, you scientist assholes,
I want a copy of that footage.
Like, I want you to put it
on a disc or something,
but don't watch it.
Just get it to me, okay?
All right.
Oh fuck.
Oh, God damn it.

I just watched something

It couldn't have been reals.
Okay.
Is there anything on that computer?
I'm cloning his hard drive now.
It shouldn't take too long.
Here, look at this.
Tape is the final link for me.
Um, I know a lot of you
have posted that
it only affects you if you play it
in a correct sequence.
But I've been experimenting on--
( lowers volume )
- Is this the kid?
- Yeah, that's him.
I found some notebooks in his room,
kind of like journals.
Mostly just nonsense though.
I'm going through them right now.
Why don't you, like,
keep looking at these tapes?
The kid's a collector.
I don't know. Who knows?
Maybe there's something
relevant on them.
Oh.
Um... okay.

Is he...?
I think so.
It looks like
he's been bit by something.
Yeah.
Will you check his pulse,
just to be sure?
Nothing.
My God, I mean,
what could have done this?
Man:
I don't know.
I don't know.
An animal?
Oh, um, yes, hello.
We found someone.
He's, like, covered in blood
and there's no pulse.
We're on the bike trails and--
I mean, it looks like he's been
bit by something.
- It's a bite, right?
- That would be my guess.
Um, what state park is this?
I don't remember.
- This is Gold Stone State Park.
- Yeah, we're at Gold Stone State Park.
Um, but I'm not sure exactly
where we are here.
It's the--
the trail off of Highway One.
Yeah, on the trails

They're gonna send--
connect us with a park ranger.
Okay.

Are your pills in your purse?
Yeah.
They're not in here. Could you have
left them at your apartment?
I don't-- maybe. I don't know. I--
All right, so what do you want me to do?
We passed a drugstore on the way here.
I could go back,
get you some aspirin or something.

Adam, can you tell?
Adam:
No. From here, not a thing.
But if I zoom in...
- Man: The top button, Adam.
- Malik: Well?
Adam: Let's just say
you really have to be looking for it.
( Malik, in Indonesian )
Excuse me if I'm wrong but, paradise?
Yes, that's correct,
our paradise.
This, all you see before you,
is temporary.
There is a higher order,
another plane of existence.
My family and I, all of my disciples
we're getting closer and closer
to crossing over to the promised gates.
You mean in a spiritual sense,
metaphorically speaking--
No, not a metaphor!
It's as literal as it gets.
It's here in this world.
It has already begun.
We're on the precipice of...
We're on the verge of...
Do you have to be so close?
Just doing my job here.
Malik:
We'd love to discuss this further,
but in a more suitable location.
I was wondering
if we could come and visit
your family at the commune
and continue this interview...
No, I'm sorry.
I do not allow nonbelievers
to enter Paradise Gates.
Experience has taught us
that in your eyes we are seen
as nothing more
than a carnival freakshow.
- I understand, sir, but...
- Lena: Malik.
Excuse me, sir, but that's why
we want your approval.
We want to show
an unbiased view of your family.
No editorial slant,
just a platform for you
to show our viewers
the truth behind the ideology
at Paradise Gates.
What do you say?

Yo, Adam.

- Whoa!
You're a fucking dick,
you know that?
Okay, guys'
( speaking Indonesian )
Madame, my name is Malik.
- This is my crew.
- Hi, I'm Lena. I'm the producer.
- Hello.
- It was quite a journey.
Yes, we found being
too close to the city
was a little dangerous for Father.
- It's safer for us out here.
- I see...
We can't let any harm come to Father.
He's our sole shepherd
on ourjourney to immortality.
- You've got a large compound here.
- Yes, out of necessity.
- Hi, what's your name?
- This is Lydia.
Hi, Lydia. Oh.
Thank you.
Did the other little girls help you?
I'm not a girl anymore.
Father took care of--
Enough, Lydia.
Tend to your sisters now.
Please follow me.
( In English )
Yeah, all right.
Adam:
Oh, wait. Wait wait wait wait.
Wait.
Hey, Lena, you want
to upsize that thing?
No, this is creepy, man.
I don't want to wear this.
Hey, Joni.
This belongs to you, man.
Malik:
Hey, Joni, Adam, come here.
Adam:
Coming coming coming.
( Rope smacking )
(woman speaks Indonesian )
How many children are in the commune?
Twenty in total.
How about Father?
Does he have any children?
- We are all Father's children here.
- ( man speaking Indonesian )
- Our Father...
- ( clicks )
( speaks English )
Joni, not too bright.
( Speaks Indonesian )
Sorry, madame.
Our almighty Father has a lot
of responsibilities for his family.
Adam.
Woman:
As you spend more time with him
- you'll grow to appreciate our ways.
- ( distant children singing )
Malik: How long have you
had this building?
For some time.
Ah, here are Father's
little chosen ones.
( Children continue singing )
Would it be okay for us to film them?
You can film only what Father allows.
(Joni, in English ) Hey,
we're not the only one filming, guys.
( In Indonesian )
Yes, those. Security purposes.
Please, this way.
Joni: Yeah.
Malik:
Okay, we'll be ready to start soon, sir.
I'd like to start by getting
your perspective,
then we'll move on
to your family and the commune.
Are you all right?
( Hisses )
- I am fine. I am ready.
- Okay.
( Malik whispers in English )
Dude, can you speed things up?
Don't forget his. Go.
(whispers )
Dude, there's blood on the mic.
( In Indonesian ) Sir, are you sure
you're okay to do this interview?
I've waited a long time for this day.
In that case,
we'll start straightaway.
- I'd like to ask...
- ( retches )
Father:
Wait. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
All right, so as I said...
-( Lena retches )
- ...I'd like to begin by asking you...
(whispers in English )
You okay?
( Lena, in Indonesian )
Excuse me, sir, the restroom?
Go downstairs, third door on the left.
- Thank you.
- ( Malik, in English ) Lena, you okay?
Just start without me.
- Are you sure?
- Lena: Yeah.
( Father, in Indonesian )
Come on, let's start.
( In English )
Yeah, um...
Hey, you know what? Sorry.
You want me to go check on Lena?
( Father, in Indonesian )
There's no need.
( In English )
Just to make sure she's fine.
( Father, in Indonesian ) Do not be
worried, Madame will take care of her.
It's okay, sir. Technical issues.
Exactly, sir.
He'll do field control
and leave us to talk.
Well, first I must start
with a somewhat challenging question.
A question that I am sure
is on most people's minds.
Regarding your lifestyle,
specifically the relationship
you have with the children here.
What's your point?
- ( Distorted music playing )
-( Lena sighs ) Okay.
Hey, kids, where's your teacher?
Wow, these are really great.
What's this a painting of?
( Madame clears throat )
Lena: I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to just barge in.
Beautiful, aren't they?
Lena:
Yes, they are.
But not as beautiful
as yours will be.
Lena:
Excuse me?
No, you will bear something
very special indeed.
You are very blessed.
- Wait, don't be scared.
- ( In English ) Hey, Lena.
You okay?
- ( In Indonesian ) Excuse me, madame.
- ( In English ) Lena, what's wrong?
Yo. Hey, Lena.
What happened?
( In Indonesian ) In order to follow
this path you have to remain pure.
I can help maintain that purity.
They bring their wives, their children
so that I may wash away
their impurities.
Wash away their impurities?
They're still children.
You may see it as unnatural,
but we see it as a progression.
I see it as underage children
involved in what many consider
illegal behavior, sir.
I have blessed them.
They will stand by me on the front line,
in the heavenly glow of the gates.
Oh, how long they have waited.
Men in robes may seek
heaven in the skies.
But not me.
I do not need to look upwards.
I simply look ahead.
For paradise is right in front of me
and I hold the key to unlock the gates.
Pull with all my might,
I will open the gates of paradise.
- This world of ours is temporary.
- Um... Malik?
- This is just the beginning.
- Sorry, the battery is almost out.
- ( In English ) Seriously?
- My bad.
- I thought I charged it yesterday.
- Man! Don't worry, I got this.
( Speaking Indonesian )
Sir, please excuse me a moment.
- Father: Where are you going?
- We need a spare battery.
I'll be right back.
( Joni exhales )
- ( thuds)
- ( sighs)
( in English )
Batteries, batteries.
( Unzips)
( indistinct conversation
on video feed )
It's been over a day, Adam.
(Adam speaks )
Listen, I need to know whether it's
going to be me or you telling Malik.
We owe it to him.
Adam:
Are you even sure it's mine?
- Malik and I haven't--
- Haven't what?
It's been a while.
Fuck! He's my fucking--
- he's my fucking best friend.
- And he's my fiancé.
Adam, I am pregnant
and you're the father.
Just cover your fucking camera.
( Lena crying )
Do you think I wanted this to happen?
Adam:
Hey hey, come on, come on.
Listen.
We can go see someone,
fix this,
no one's gonna know.
Lena:
What the fuck?
- Adam: What?
- Fuck you!
I don't need you.
I'll tell Malik myself.
And whether or not I keep this,
and whether or not he walks,
I still don't fucking need you!
What?
You heard me.
Fine.
Decision made.
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck him.
God damn it.
( Lena sobs )
( sobbing continues )
( clock bells chiming )
( in Indonesian ) In your opinion what
do you think about organized religion...
- It's time.
- ( static over P.A. )
Joni: What?
( P.A. echoing )
Brothers and sisters.
My children.
Lovers of my life.
Follow me,
for I have been the compass
of your souls.
Months...
- ( clatters )
- Even years...
Oh, it felt like an eternity.
But now we are approaching
the final steps.
Today, at this very moment,
- we will reach our salvation.
- ( Adam panting )
- ( door squeaks )
- This is it!
- ( Electricity crackles )
- The final key to Paradise is ours.
Father has been waiting for you,
we must go to him directly.
- My wives and my children.
- Take one cup each, my little ones.
- Don't waver from your path.
- Make sure to drink every drop.
Yesterday you were tainted and sullied.
Today you stand as angels of purity.
Don't be afraid, hold firm.
Guide yourself to the promised land.
Take into your hearts
what you're about to do...
Sir?
- Don't fucking interrupt me!

And for my sons and brothers!
Our path is filled
with unholy obstacles,
but as we step closer to him,
boulders shall become
mere pebbles.
I command you!
Vanquish them with me!
( In English )
What the fuck? Sir!
What the--

It is our time now...
Stand up.
-( P.A. feedback)
- And give your bodies to him.
Lena: What?
- As we approach these final steps.
- Lena: No, you can't do this.
Know that we will soon
bask in his embrace.
( Approaching footsteps )
( Lena whimpers )
( in English ) Fuck.
( In Indonesian )
What the fuck is going on?
Rejoice, child,
the time has cometh.
(in English ) Hey!
- Stop! Stop!
- ( equipment clatters )
Adam:
Oh fuck. Fuck!
( Static )
(woman singing )
Father:
Virgins, angels,
all your desires--
He shall provide.
Until we meet again, my brothers.
