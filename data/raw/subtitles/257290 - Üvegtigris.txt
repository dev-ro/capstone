Good morning dear listeners,
good morning, Lajos.
- Good morning, Gábor.
- You look really ugly today.
As usual.
l practised a bit at home.
l thought it was intentional.
- You don't look great, either.
- Why, this is my best jacket.
- He's got graffiti all over his
jacket. - Autographs from Kiss.
They stood behind your back?
The whole band?
l lay down and they knelt on me.
- Let's change the subject.
What day is it today? - July 4.
What day is that in the US?
l know, lndependence Day.
God damn it!
Hey, l'm coming.

Why Glass Tiger?
Should it be Wooden Puma?
The name was my idea.
But it's
in a fucking bad place.
Lanky said the caravan was
all right there.
l told him it wasn't.
Leave me, l must be off.
- But they're gone now...
- Was it good? - Ja.
Ja? Are you German or what?
Was it good or wasn't it?
- l'll miss the bus.
- Go, then. But was it good?
- lt was.
- Why do you say it like that?
Why not properly?
That it was good.
- l told you it was.
- lt was better than ever.
- l told you it was good.
- You know what?
lt was better than ever.
That's why you're like this.
You're stunned.
You see? You're stunned.
ls it good now?
l've told you, you're stunned.
Easy rider, brother, easy rider.
l live with my mother,
l ride a Babetta,
l have a cat and
l shouldn't be tough?
A beer!
Dear Choco, you're
really very tough today.
Me? Laller, don't make
an asshole of yourself...
Bye! Thanks for the dough.
Billions, man, billions.
Why don't l have billions?
You think old Choco
won't get some dough
and scram to America?
l'm off!
New York by plane,
then across the prairie
along Route 66.
l'll shoot at each
fucking traffic sign!
l'll marry a broad and
rob all the gas stations
on our honeymoon!
Great stuff!
Sipping whisky
from paper bags,
rolling joints,
screwing all the hitch-hiking
cunts with tits on them.
l may not even get married,
come to think of it...
That will disappoint a few.
Look, Laller what l bought.
l'll give it to the shitheads.
l'm off. Beverly Hills,
Hollywood, Rodeo Drive...
Pamela Anderson will fall
for the old dickey right away.
Put it away. Then Mexico!
Tequila, mestizo broads.
- Badly guarded Latino banks!
- Put it away. The cops are here.
You should live there
not in this fucking slime...
Hi, neeno, neeno...
Good morning, gentlemen.
Hi, Lali.
Everything all right?
- But of course.
- Hi, Choco. Out on parole?
- A breathalyser?
- l'd prefer a blow job.
Why did you park this caravan
here of all places?
There's this little lake here...
- The one with the seaweed?
- Yeah.
lt'll be busy, you'll see.
Nobody will ever come here.
The water's murky like agitation...
- One, two, three... jinx.
- Jinx.
Boat 0 16.
Moustache, Rezsõ,
where are you?
l'll get it.
- Bye, Choco.
- See ya.
- All the best.
- Moustache, come on.
- l'm coming, boss.
- No more goodbyes. Drink up.
- But my beer's disappeared.
- You fuck with the cops?
- Okay, okay.
- The key.
And don't come here to screw.
Got it? Yeah?
One day l'll fuck the pants
off all these dirty bunnies!
Hi, Lali.
Hi.
A businessman must be on time.
Haven't l told you?
- This one talks all right.
- lt did yesterday, right, Röfi?
Thursday? Or Wednesday?
Thursday.
Look at this, Lali.
- Saw a button on this one.
- This is cool.
Move over. Use your brain.
Fox, where did you get it?
Are you released every day?
What shall l do? Play on the
stockmarket? Clever.
What's up? Get it out.
Okay, grab it.
Don't just fucking gape.
Don't let me and Lali
carry it over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
Listen, Lali.
Don't talk to me like.
- These men respect me.
- Think highly of you.
Coming back to that piece of iron...
There's a lot of dough in it.
So many people come here...
lf someone is interested, let him
know about it. There will be fine.
- What is this? - How should
l know? l got it from someone.
Or rather left it with me.
lt's a great bargain.
lt's good for something.
lt's big. Ballast or a support.
Support? What support?
lt has no serial number.
Can it stay? Okay?
We're off, Daddy.
l took up with them because
they liked my playing the sax.
Sanyi!
Sanyi, for God's sake!
Sanyi!
- We're playing the sax.
- Sanyi, stop it. - Sanyi.
Do something with this here.
You don't like my playing the sax.
l do, l do but l...
like you more.
When Lanky plays the sax,
something stirs in me.
A desire.
To strangle him,
or something.
Hi, pal! Nice boat.
Wassup, Lali?
How's your goldmine?
Hi, Gaben.
- Wassup?
- Fine, dear Lali, fine.
America's here again...
Then you'll dig this here.
lmpala.
Chevrolet lmpala.
No too bad?
- How big is it?
- Not too small. - Big?
lt sure is. Do you
remember Kriszti Farkas?
The hairdresser?
Haidresser? That l don't know.
She has red...
- A redhead!
- Orange, rather...
Like a Fox.
l screwed her in this one on
Children's Day last year.
- ln this one?
- Well, in one like this one.
l have been working in
the car industry for a while.
- Tell me about it.
- Listen.
l have one exactly like this.
For sale. You could have it.
How could l have it?
You're sitting here in this
shabby buffet caravan
like Jockey Ewing when
he was an apprentice.
l know you adore everything Yank.
Hang on, l get it.
You want to sell me a car.
- This is not just a car.
- This is just a car for me.
- No.
- Why?
Because you can't just buy
one like this.
- Why should l buy one like this?
- Don't you want one? - Wanna bet?
You didn't even know
such cars existed at all.
So how d'you know you
don't want to buy one?
You may well do.
- Do you need the money?
- lt's not just the money.
- What else?
- lt's a mission for me.
- A mission.
- Exactly.
So you're doing it for the good of me.
Listen.
l see you don't get it.
l'll give you an example.
lf you drank Coke all the time,
l'd tell you to drink Fanta.
lf you drink Fanta,
you fill your guts with the
same sugary water as the others,
but since they drink Coke
and you drink Fanta,
you differ from them.
Try to understand that.
That's why l drive such cars.
lnterested?
Hi, Dad.
Doesn't it have a great width!
Breadth, Joli, breadth!
A lovely trophy, a killer.
Doesn't it have a great breadth!
Have you seen anything
like this, Betty?
A killer.
Mum! l smeared the polish
because of you.
You got hamburgers?
Sure.
What kind?
- Mushroom?
- Yeah.
Mushroom, then.
- You use Chinese mushrooms?
- Yeah.
l don't want that.
- Why?
- They taste of can.
This is not a can.
lt's a jar.
They taste of jar, then. No.
l want a hot dog.
Okay.
- Ketchup or mustard?
- Mustard.
But don't soak it in mustard,
be careful with it.
Will you be away long?
l'll get this one.
l'll shoot it dead.
l'll shoot a stag this big!
That's too much.
l'd rather have some ketchup.
- Do you have mineral water?
- l do. - Still?
-Yeah.
- Sparkling, then.
- How many bubbles?
- Sorry?
- l have 1 , 5, 1 0 bubbles.
- Really?
- The one bubble is expensive. Had
to get rid of the rest. - Really?
Here's the bubble spoon.
Swiss.
- What's this? - Hamby.
- l won't eat it. - You will.
- No.
- Yeah, you will.
- l won't.
- You will.
- l want the book of complaints.
- l haven't got one.
- That's impossible.
- l have one, then.
- Where is it?
- ln a bag. Eat it.
- Sorry? - Eat it
if you're fucking hungry.
- l won't.
- You will.
- Good bye, Uncle Oszi. Walk?
- What was that?
Go home and get your mother
cook for you, you little shit.
- Listen, Lala.
- Lali, not Lala. Lali.
- Okay. Are you listening?
- lntently.
- You want iron?
- lron?
- You've just brought me some.
- This is different.
- A lamppost. Cool. Tall.
- Leave me alone with those.
Okay, Lala.
- And don't call me Lala...
- Why?
Because l'll cut your heart out.
That's why.
Okay, fine.
Boat 0 16... Come in...
Moustache, Rezsõ...
Where are you?
- Do you know what l want?
- What? - A sleeping policeman.
- Moustache, Rezsõ...
Where are you? - ln uniform?
- Concrete, you idiot.
- Concrete?
- Can you get me one?
- l can. Concrete it will be.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Lali.
Well? lt's got some feeling, right?
- Hi, Betty. - Look at it in the
light of the setting sun.
- lt's morning, Gaben.
- Details... - When are you coming?
l'm with you. Just a sec.
Do you still have the catalogue?
l'm bored.
l'll be with you in a sec.
Listen to some music.
- l am.
- Switch it off, then.
l've got a buyer for yours.
- My car?
- Don't exaggerate.
- lt's not for sale.
- They'd buy it though.
- You can still get something
for it. - And my delivery?
Your Uaz fits in it twice.
You can't drive a car like this.
lt's not for you.
You're a serious person.
Listen, sweetheart. Do you
know what car we'll have?
We'd sell that one.
We could buy a new one now.
A 7 1 ' lmpala. A Chewy.
American...
We'll go on a holiday, too...
l don't know.
l don't know that, either.
But l want this now.
Okay, l won't. Bye.
- So you won't.
- But of course l will.
You're lucky, Zsolti.
lt was worth every penny.
Hi, Gaben. l hope it doesn't
fall into pieces.
Hi, Zsolti!
Well, who's the king now?
lt wasn't worth that much.
Buy this one.
Or buy this one.
They drink too much.
Here's an American stall.
And here you are,
a tough American guy.
- l'm not American.
- But you want to be. - No.
Why? What'd you want to be?
How should l know?
Happy.
You can be happy in this one,
man.
Tune yourself in,
and whatever happens put on a pair
of shades and step on the gas.
Your compressor will suck
better than any girlfriend.
That was nice.
l've read it somewhere.
Bring it.
- Who's the king, Sanyi?
- Koko!
- Who else?
- Lali!
- And?
- Sanyi! Sanyi!
Sanyi who?
Sanyi King. Sanyi is the king.
Okay, Sanyi, go for it!
Always Koko. Lali!
That's his mania.
Hi! Hi!
Bloody flies!
Sanyi, is he coming here?
Sanyi?
Hey, somebody!
Excuse me...
Just a sec.
l'll be with you in a sec.
- l'm in a hurry...
- And l'm having a piss...
How long?
You know how to live!
- You do some boxing?
- Yeah.
- Good for you.
- So stop bothering me or else...
l was just joking.
l'm not cruel.
- Your kidneys okay?
- l have some problems...
Hang in there, man.
King...
King... man...
What's the matter?
ls he gone?
- Koko!
- Wassup?
Your mother never loved me.
We're having a rest.
- Pissing, anybody?
- What about Mom?
She never loved me.
Give your dad
something to eat.
Mom's been dead for six years.
What's that compared to the
30 while she didn't love me?
Give me some soda water.
She loved you, though.
Excuse me, where can one
have a piss here?
- There's a toilet there.
- There's a toilet there.
- But you can't use it.
- But you can't use it.
Dad, haven't you seen
a tomato somewhere?
You never look attentively.
A driver taught me
this trick in 1 967.
Taught me? Sold me.
For 1 40 Forints...
Make fun of me!
Do you have any business here?
You know what you need?
A television set. So that you
don't die of boredom.
And a woman.
Who loves you.
Give me the soda water.
l'm told the caravan is
in the wrong place.
This caravan is in the right place.
You are in the wrong place.
And me.
Hali, Lali-papi.
- Popi-kuki, mami..
- Chill out, Lali.
There's a draught here.
Don't girls ever come this way?
- How about Betty?
- lt's over.
- How come?
- She's got mad at me.
- lt was her Mom..
- What'd she do?
- Found us in the act.
- Her mother?
- No. Betty did...
- What an idiot you are...
Why didn't you lock the door?
We always did.
- With Betty?
- No, with her mom.
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.
How'ya doing?
Awkward...
Clumsy. Seven letters.
Awkward.
Will you have something?
Fanta?
You look great.
- Can or bottle?
- Bottle...
That'll be fine.
l'd have a bite.
- l have some sausages.
- Shall l help you?
- Will you come in?
- lf you want me to.
We never had the same taste
in women.
Mom... mom...
- Yes?
- Mom.
Mom.
- My mom's here.
- Your mom?
- Well... Joli...
- My fingernail damn it.
Hi, Lajos...
- l'm closing.
- Now?
- l'm closing now.
- l've just arrived...
And l'm just leaving.
God, it's late.
- Are you alone?
- Sanyi's gone running.
- Can l be your last customer?
- Stop it now.
Somebody will see your car
from the road.
l parked a long way off.
Just got in for a sausage...
- Run out...
- l'll come in.
- Pull me in.
- What?
Pull me in. Oszi's here.
My husband, you idiot.
- Hi, Lali!
- Good morning, uncle Oszi.
What makes this noise?
A dog?
- Field mice. - Would you like
me to...? - No. l like field mice.
- Shooting pheasants?
- No.
A coffee, perhaps?
No.
Has Joli been here?
No, why?
Nothing...
Do you have some sausages?
l've never had any.
Maybe it's not field mice.
Maybe it's my wife hiding there.
You'll be a married man
one day, too, Lali.
Yes l was running...
Then one left here, then
another one... Joli and Betty...
and l chased them because...
they were running.
- Beatles.
- No! Shadows.
- Beatles.
- lt's the Shadows, believe me.
Beatles, beetles...
Shadows is different.
- Two beetles, one shadow.
- Do you know English so well?
According to witnesses
the robbers fled from the scene
in an old red van.
The two robbers escaped with
about 40 million Forints.
One man fired several shots
at the security camera,
still it recorded the attack,
so the police managed
to get a good description.
Nobody was hurt
but that was pure accident,
since without any reason,
one robber fired several
shots at the safe of the bank.
- The guy executed the safe.
- lt sounds like Choco...
- No...
- Who else would shoot a safe?
- Come off it.
- Go ahead, Zsolti.
Everyone will stare in the street.
- lt was him. That's his style.
- No... come off it.
- Easy rider, brother, easy rider.
- Choco, the safe destroyer.
- What's the buzz, gringos?
- We heard about the bank robbery.
- We thought you did it.
- Why, didn't l?
Okay, sunshine...
Fucking wind there is...
My rum? My beer?
Your rum, your beer.
l really believed it was you.
Shooting guys took 40 mill
from a safe.
For that much...
l'd be damned if l didn't do it.
Choco flies off
and you stay here...
Good guys can come along.
What a mobile!
Lali, l'm rather hungry.
Go and make something
for yourself, will you?
Yeah?
Okay, thanks.
And Lank, switch that off,
will you?
- Lali, what day is it today?
- Tuesday?
- But this bread isn't fresh.
- Does it have a label?
- lt says Tuesday.
- There's one every week.
- How d'you open it?
- You mean it's a week old?
- Just pull it down?
- Over there!
Don't eat it if you don't like it.
Listen, this...
- lsn't it..? - lt is.
- Choco! - Leave me alone!
- Hello. Give me a coke, quick.
- Cool!
- Wassup, brother?
- l'll be right back.
D'you think l don't know
it's you, Gaben?
- Don't move!
- That's mine. Was.
Put down that knife.
Put that knife down.
- Put it down.
- Put that knife down!!!
l suggest that you scram
and we forget everything.
As if nothing had happened.
- Shut up!
- Do you want this or don't you?
lt was them, damn it.
- Kusturica.
- No names!
- Who's the boss? You?
- No, him. - Me? - No, him.
No, him.
Thanks.
You put your beers down.
Clear? l said clear?
Clear.
Get inside that stall.
Lock them up.
- Have you got your gun?
- No, god damn it, no.
- Boss, they are armed.
- Thanks, Sanyi. - Hey, man.
Come here. Give me
something to drink.
- Take off your clothes. - What?
- Shut up and give me a coke.
- But what about our clothes?
- Take them off. - l won't.
- So you'll die dressed up.
- Hurry, his hiccup is worse...
What?
- ls that why you stopped?
- What's so funny?
Our driver is sick and
unable to drive.
Give me that fucking coke!
Strip!
Strip!
- What is it?
- He wants one more.
- Let's not waste more time.
- His hiccup is terrible.
- Scare him.
- Stop laughing or l'll shoot.
Here, by the road?
Everyone's staring anyway.
This is fucking great...
- Boss, underpants, too?
- Underpants, too.
How stupid can you get!
Scram before you get caught.
No shit. We won't get caught.
Really?
The camera recorded you.
Says you. l shot the camera.
l saw you on TV
shooting the safe.
Shut up!
- You missed the camera?
- My foot. l hit it all right.
- You missed the camera!
- l hit it!
You missed the camera.
How can you be such an idiot?
We're on the fucking film!
We'll rot in jail.
l don't care, l'll bugger you first.
You'll get buggered first!
What's so funny? That my pal
is sick and unable to drive?
Why don't you drive?
Let's get outta here.
What are you doing?
Stop kicking it!
Can't you wait a moment?
Someone will come.
- You sure?
- Sure.
lt's hot in here, boss.
- The window won't open.
- l nailed it up.
- Shall l bust it out?
- No, someone will come.
- Shall l blow a loud one?
- No!!!
- l don't think l can do it...
- What?
- Hold it back.
- Not now, you fool...
- Stop shouting. - Hold it back.
We're holding it back, too.
- l can't. l had two beers.
- That's true.
What shall l do now?
- Piss into something.
- l'll throw up.
lt's not the best idea...
Do you have a better one?
No...
So?
- Better into a bottle than
on the floor. - God!
Go ahead.
Find something, Choco.
l can't...
What?
- l can't. Turn away.
- Now?
l can't do it if you watch me.
You crazy? We wouldn't watch
you if you paid for it.
l can't help it.
ln a public toilet l stop
when someone comes in.
- Okay, we're turned.
- Thanks.
- Shall we sing something?
- That'll be great.
''ln the jail window'', okay?
/n the jail window...
l didn't see them... clearly.
l didn't see them clearly.
Years fly by,
like a passing moment.
The sun shines brightly,
the light is dazzling...
lf you found a mobile
on them, it's mine.
/ think of you, / love you...
l don't remember anything.
Bravo! Well done!
ls that you, guys?
Who's this genius?
The Fox.
He can't be such a fool. Fox,
where've you been so long?
- At the barber's. What's up?
- l'll shoot this idiot.
Why are you naked?
- Has it rained here, too?
- Leave it to me. - Fox!
Yes?
Go to the back
and knock off the padlock.
You locked up? Why didn't
someone let you out?
Because nobody came here.
- The stall's in the wrong place.
- l can't believe it.
Listen, Fox.
You're right.
We've been locked up.
And we are naked.
And it has rained, too.
Believe me, we don't enjoy
ourselves in here.
So please go to the back
and knock off that fucking lock.
- How?
- With your dick!
Fox, have you got some
clothes on you?
- Clothes?
- Things people wear.
- l do but not exactly...
- Never mind. Bring them.
Nobody came until 9.
- So?
- lt's just that...
What?
The caravan's in the
wrong place, right?
Well, it is.
- lf we take a triangle...
- What for?
- To calculate it.
- We should move it to the left.
- There is a rule.
- Rule of thumb.
Rule of thumb, my foot.
Let's get out of here.
You know how l'd like to
go back? ln the lmpala.
Don't you worry. l told you
you'll have one.
What a lovely car!
Beatles.
- You can tell from this much?
- He's a fucking musician!
From Gaben? A car?
Better be careful.
Why? He's a nice guy.
With a pinch of salt.
l bought my first one from him.
My dear Lali,
shall l handcuff him?
l'd rather you got my
underpants back.
We're on the scent...
dear Lali...
- Let's go, Moustache. Bye.
- See you.
- Spit it out.
- He asked me how much l had.
l told him, so he showed me
a yellow Wartburg.
Finally he persuaded me.
He said it was good and big.
He was right, too.
A Wartburg is big.
Than a few things happened,
but we survived after all.
He gave back the money
right away, that's true.
He said he had a Trabant
for the same amount.
He said it was good and small.
So l bought some music
and a bicycle.
Which is good and good.
That's great.
So be careful with him.
He's a nice guy but swampy
a little - morally.
Hi, brother.
Your boat will be cool.
- When?
- Chill out. No worry. Coffee?
- For money.
- Oh. Something the matter?
- Nothing.
- Okay. l'll bring it this week.
What are you driving these for?
Bring mine.
- No fresh...?
- No.
- Won't you leave me in the shit?
- Listen.
l told you you'll have an lmpala.
So you will.
lf it breaks down,
l'll repair it for you.
lf it breaks down again,
l'll get you another one.
- Have l ever stood you up?
- You have... - Well...
- A hundred.
- Come on. Go to hell.
Listen, l know how to
do business.
l gave for this one 800.
You know how much it is
in the shop? 4600.
l paid for this one 3000.
How much it is in the shop? 1 5000.
This pair of shades
cost me 2500.
- And in the shop?
- 300. l was conned.
Lali is my cousin...
He can see through me.
l need some good ideas.
lt hardly grows.
Sanyi!
Look, he leaves the can
in the middle of the road.
- What ideas?
- l have this stuff.
- l don't know what to do
with it. - What? - Toys.
And you can't sell them?
They're not just everyday toys.
What shall l do with 400
piglets with no heads?
- Sucking?
- No, Disney.
Are you serious?
- What piglets?
- l told you, toys.
Plush. Nice ones. There's
a hole on their belly,
with a ribbon that says
''l love you''.
They can say hello, too.
- And their heads?
- They haven't got any.
They were made like that.
They almost threw them out.
My friend works there.
He called me.
- What shall l do with them?
- Don't know. Perhaps... nothing.
- Throw them all out.
- l can't. They cost me a lot.
- You paid money for them?
- Yeah...
My friend has a few socks with
no soles. You could swap.
- Dotted ones?
- l'll find out.
You threw everything here?

Why l let you?
You brought them here.
Foxtail, shitty sink?

the grindstone away.
How can you be...

So they won't be here.
They'll make someone happy.

He's mad.

Stupid place for a stall.
Six chocolates for the kids.

They'll eat them. Any kind.
Go away from here, mate.
Go away.

Little girl, don't do it.

- Lovely car...
This is not what we agreed on.
You told me to bring a Chewy.
Here it is.
- You said an lmpala...
- People will turn after you.
Like your mother.
l don't want her, either.
- Lali, this is not your style.
- Fast car, ain't it?
lt's been bought.
What's the matter,
this is a good car...
An lmpala, or nothing.
What's for sale?
This one?
l said to the guy it was bigger...
- What is this? - A Chewy.
Not a big engine, but fast.
Not much but people will
turn after you in the street.
Don't give it to me...
l have the same profession.
Okay, l'll say something to him.
- Here's the Cadet.
- And the dough.
What's this?
The guy didn't give me any money,
but he gave me an electric piano.
And a battery.
What?
l'll give you some money, too.
l'll arrange it with the guy.
Here's twenty.
Ten,
fifteen,
twenty. Okay?
Plus the organ.
Sure thing. Find someone
who plays at weddings,
it's worth everything to him.
- How much? - Fifty.
Or eighty, anything.
More than that. How much?
How much?
Twenty-twenty five...
- Thirty.
- Plus the Smart card.
- No, l have 6000 points.
- That's why.
l'm not giving it...
l collected them...
And we'll continue, right?
And buy a few things...
Bye, Gaben.
lt was a good deal, dear Lali.
Sorry.
Let's divide the money, okay?
l'm not rolling in it
these days, either.
l'll see you with the lmpala!
He didn't mean it.
Go on, Choco.
l don't think everyone was
watching you...
Yeah, afterwards.
You needn't have told her
to drop dead.
Because she's my grandmother.
They're not angry...
Uncle Matyi's not angry,
either. l know you were right.
She'll be in bed for 2-3 months
then forget the whole thing.
Here l am.
Will you have something?
Beer?
And rum...
Problems with Mummy?
Shoot the old gal.
l'd shoot her.
l'd shoot yours, too...
lf you had one...
- Are you mad, Chicano?
- Don't speak in Spanish.
- Why not?
- Because you can't.
lf you could l'd say speak.
Does it always have its side
open? And the roof, too?
lt's like an Ementhaler.
They'll be held up one day.
Disappeared, Chicano?
Are you here, Chicano?
What are you doing, Sanyi?
Of course, it doesn't grow.
- l'm watering it.
- What are you watering?
- The flower..
- No flower. Thuya.
And if it were a flower?
lt's all yellow.
Put your dick away.
We don't get any business.

You come here for fun?
But now you'll get screwed,

Lali, come out of the shop.
Don't move or l'll shoot.
- Chill out, Choco. Give me
the pistol. - Forget it, Lali.
These fuckers screwed us

Go to the car. Both of you.
Come on, get moving.
l'll avenge you, Sanyi.
Where's the dough?
Damn!
You got away this time, fuck you.

- Salted?
lmre. lmre Peanuts.
Supervisor. l'll come in.
Display cooking?
We've received a complaint
that on the 9th
of this month you served an
inedible hot dog to a customer.
He asked for the book of
complaints, which you refused
to give him calling him
obscene names.
As a result of my
investigation l declare,
that the statements of the
complaining Kálmán Peanuts
have proven right and the stall
called Glass Tiger is unsuitable
for selling food
for human consumption.
Therefore l order immediate
closure of the vending stall,
and requiring the co-operation
of the public health authorities,
l recommend
further investigations.
The resolution and the
official minutes
will be sent to you by post.
l am going to transmit
my comments ...
What's he doing?
Don't touch him! Oh, my God!
- ls that an electric shock?
- l don't know...
l've never seen anything
like it... Hit him! Hit him! Look!
He's a goner.
He's not well,
he's not well at all.
Call an ambulance.
Peanuts? Salted?
Oh, a name?
No, l can't recall anyone.
What luck that he's alive.
- Won't we get into trouble?
- No. Throw this into the lake.
Lali, l'll play that.
- How much?
- A hundred.
Just this one.
Take no risks, Rezsõ.
You have children.
- This way?
- Yeah. Up and down.
l hear someone's almost
got electrocuted but didn't.
lt happened to me once,
but l can take it.
My organism can take it.
Look, Moustache,
have l won?
Lali should know.
All those zeroes...
This is one million...
The jackpot!
Then l won!
l scratched it.
Right, Lali?
- l don't believe it.
- l don't believe it.
l'll leave the force, see this?
Are you happy, Moustache?
l'll get the hell outta here,
Lali, get out.
Are you crazy, Rezsõ?
He's crazy.
Rezsõ!!!
What are you doing?
ls that how much the force
means to you?
This is incredible, it was
there in my hand!
- Fucking one million!
- Why did l give it to him?
l gave it to him, damn it.
This can't be true.
Shall l marry you?
l'd marry you...
Lali!
How do you think
l got here?
- Hello, come on back!
- Gaben, the key.
Hang on, l'll turn round.
Not like that...
Made in Detroit.
When Detroit's finished,
the world is finished.
My foot. My fucking
Babetta is finished.
These guys bury my
cylinder-head.
Blow it, damn you.
Gas to gas,

Rest in peace, lmpala.

Come on, Lali!
Sorry.
Drink!
Puss, puss, pussy.
We're here.
Which one shall l buy you?
You want them both?
Whatever you want,
my dear Lali...
Absolutely fine, but not now...
Screwing is best.
Especially with someone
who knows how.
Betty did.
Do you know what it was
like with Betty?

- But you screwed her mother...
- Put some fucking wine in it...
Her mother...
Her mother, too.
Fuck you!
You screwed my girlfriend,

But l'm not mad at you.

- Why did you sell it?
- Why did you leave it here?
- l've been beaten for two days
because of it. - Why?
How should l know?
Four bastards came for the iron.
l don't know what's it called.
Stop fretting, Fox.
There's the money, pay them.
Not enough.
lt's worth 2 million.
Two mill? They should beat
you for that all right.
- They will beat you, too.
- Me? Come on...
lf l can't pay, you'll have to.
Or bring the iron back.
- How could l, you idiot?
- Who did you give it to?
No clue. How do they know

- l told them, you genius.
- You're a bastard, Fox.
- Shut up, Choco.
- Don't be so tough.
- l'll bust you, Choco.
- Come, let's have it out, pal.
Get lost, Choco.
Are you tough?
Why did you mix me into it?
What's it to you?
What'd you mean what? What
would you do without me, stupid?
You've got a big mouth
to bark with, you sissy.
Bark? Your mother barks.

Not my car...
Stop!
Something stinks.
Where are you heading,
Chicanos?
Why aren't there any seats

- Business? Man?
- Gaben! Watch the road!
There he is standing.
Stop!
Where's my car?
Gaben,... where?
What is it, you ape?

scratch on my car l'll kill him.
- Congratulations!
- l'll be damned!
- My car!
- What car? You complaining?
- What're you doing, you ass?
- Just you watch.
The cash delivery van
will come in a sec.
One man goes in, leaves his gun
behind. The other stays in the van.
- There's nobody around.
- So?
No bells ring, Chicano?
An unarmed security man
with a sack of money inside,
- another in the van with a hole
above him and one on the side. - So?
Your brains won't kill you.
The village is empty.
Two of us at the car. Waiting
with the engine running.
- Am l king or am l?
- You're an idiot.
We have 5 minutes.
When the van arrives, l'm off.
You want to get busted
for a piece of fucking iron?
50 mill at least, ten for each.
- We'll be rich! - You really don't
know where that iron is?
Tonight you can push
the Tiger into the lake.
They'll kill me, Lali.
They want it so much.
- That shit?
- Yeah.
You can't do it.
l'll wait in the car.
But l won't do anything.
Five's enough for me.
Plus you get my car fixed.
No...

Couldn't l wait in the back?
Two million's enough for me.
- Gaben!
- Don't worry, chicken.
Lali!
- What?
- Nothing.
- And those guys?
- They're nobodies.
Now.
l'll count to ten.
We'll be rich after five.
Assholes.

Excuse me,

On the main road a tireless

Drivers have to wait
for quite a while.
Especially because traffic
is directed by the police.
Resolution about
suspending the investigation.
No connection between the
robbery at the Bienniale in Vienna
and the ''Glass Tiger'' group
has been found.
Therefore the investigation is closed.
