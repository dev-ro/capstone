- How are you, Doctor?
- Hello, Harry.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hello, Dr Brewster, Mr Stanley.
- Say, those all the passengers you had?
- Just the four.
You didn't put anybody off
at the wrong station?
We're meeting a friend of
the Caldwells, Count Alucard.
There was no count on this train.
All customers.
There was a lot of stuff in the baggage car
that might belong to your count.
Thanks. We'll take a look at it.
(Man) All aboard!
(Train pulls away)
Does this look like he's come
to stay for just a few weeks?
No, it doesn't.
I wonder what's become of him?
Probably coming by car.
Don't worry, he'll show up.
"D-R-A-C..."
- What are you mumbling about?
- Nothing. Just a silly idea hit me.
There's no Alucard
so there's no need of our waiting.
I've got to get back to the office.
- Is that you, Matthew?
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Kay.
I brought the trunks but Mr Frank said
the Count didn't come on the train.
Oh. Well, put them
in the guesthouse as I told you.
Yes, but I have to have some help.
They're amazingly heavy.
- Get some of the other boys to help you.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, Sam. Come on.
- Matthew's back.
- Did the Count come?
No, not yet.
If you had a phone,
Frank could have called you.
If I still lived here, I'd have one,
even if I had to string the wires myself.
- There are other means of communication.
- Please, Kay.
No lectures on metaphysics tonight, huh?
You should allow your mind
to explore the unknown, Claire,
then you wouldn't laugh at telepathy.
I know Count Alucard will be here tonight
without benefit of telephone.
He probably missed the train
and will come tomorrow.
I must see Dad a minute
before I dress for the party. See you later.
(Frogs croaking, birds squawking)
(Mumbled chanting)
You do not know why
you came here tonight.
It was because I wished you here.
Well, why? Isn't Count Alucard...
I wished you here to warn you.
The angel of death
hovers over a great house.
I see it in ruins.
Weeds, vines growing over it,
bats flying in and out the broken windows.
But I want to know of Count Alucard.
Is he coming?
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me, Queen Zimba?
Alucard is not his name.
You must stop him before it is too late.
Stop him before death comes to Dark Oaks.
Tell me if he is coming tonight.
I see you marrying a corpse,
living in a grave.
- I see...
- (Wings flapping)
(Bat squeaking)
Queen Zimba!
(Bird cawing)
(" Waltz)
Hello, Steven.
This excitement over Kay's count
has worn me out.
If you'll all excuse me,
I'll let Steven take me upstairs.
- Good night, Colonel.
- Good night.
- He's holding up very well.
- Night.
Good night, Colonel.
Well, Father, we'll have to do this
all again when Count Alucard does come.
- I'm afraid so.
- I hope you're not too tired.
No, I feel fine.
Now, you run along and dance.
Steven will help me. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.
Good night.
I'll smoke a cigar before going to bed.
- That'll be all for now, Steven.
- Yes, sir.
Kay, you look worried.
I wish you'd tell me what it is.
Wouldn't you be upset
if your guest of honour didn't appear?
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?
I suppose it is, but I thought
you might be worrying about
that old Hungarian Gypsy
you brought back with you.
I understand she died tonight.
- Queen Zimba?
- Queen?
That old swamp cat with a cabin full
of dried lizards and stuffed toads?
It's good riddance, if you ask me.
How did you know she was dead?
That sort of news travels fast.
One of the farm hands told me.
He also said you were there when she died.
- I'd hoped no one knew that.
- Why?
She died of a heart attack.
Your being there has no bearing on it.
Oh, they'll ask questions.
What was I doing there?
What brought on the attack?
And if I told them,
no one around here would believe it.
What do they know of these occult matters?
Blind fools.
Kay, I think it's about time
I talked to you frankly.
We're not blind, we're not fools.
We're just sensible people that
aren't fooled by supernatural nonsense.
- Nonsense?
- Exactly.
There's no magic in dried lizards
and dead chickens.
Since you met this Count Alucard
in Budapest, you've changed.
I hardly know you.
Kay, let me take you away
from all this morbid business.
A six-month honeymoon, a year if you like.
We won't come back until you've overcome
some of these strange ideas.
I'm sorry.
Sorry? Does that mean
you're breaking our engagement?
Oh, no. You mustn't even think that.
Then what is it, Kay?
There must be some reason.
Of course there's a reason.
Since we were kids, there's never been
anyone in my heart but you. You know that.
But, well...
Don't ever doubt me, Frank,
no matter what happens. Believe in me.
Believe that what I'm doing
is best for us both.
Has it anything to do with Alucard?
(Sighs)
I see.
I'm afraid there's something
I must tell you, Kay.
Alucard is an impostor, a fake.
- How can you say that?
- I wrote to Senator Manfield.
He said Count Alucard is not known
at the Hungarian embassy.
You must be very proud of that snooping.
I did it to protect the girl I intend to marry.
Miss Kay!
- Dr Brewster, can I help?
- No. Stay here. Keep the party moving.
Father!
Get some water!
Looks like the Colonel fell asleep
and dropped his cigar.
Yeah, that's probably what happened.
There's no evidence of asphyxiation.
His heart might have stopped before the fire.
He may have died in his sleep.
He looks as though he were
literally frightened to death.
It's purely a reflex of the facial muscles.
Doctor, what are those two marks
on the throat?
(Claire sobbing)
Come, Claire. I think you'd better go.
(Car door slams)
(Car drives away)
(Knocking)
Announce Count Alucard.
Explain that I came by motor
and was delayed.
I'm sorry, sir,
but Colonel Caldwell died tonight
and the family isn't receiving.
- Announce me!
- Yes, sir.
Central, I called Professor Lazlo at
Muirfield University about half an hour ago.
Will you please check the call for me?
This is Dr Harry Brewster, 228. Thank you.
(Telephone)
Hello?
Yes, this is Harry Brewster speaking.
Fine, thank you.
Why, I called to find out
if you know anything about
a titled Hungarian family named Alucard,
A-L-U-C-A-R-D.
Alucard? No.
I'm sure there is no such family.
The name is not Hungarian.
Well, can you tell me, is it possible
there's a Count Dracula still living?
Dracula? I'm sure there is not.
History says the last Count Dracula
died in the Middle Ages. Why do you ask?
A certain Count Alucard
is visiting a friend of mine.
I happened to notice that
the name spelled backward is Dracula.
It made me curious.
That is strange.
According to the legends of my people
the last Count Dracula
became one of the undead, a vampire,
and was finally destroyed
in the 19th century.
(Chuckles) I am considered somewhat
of an authority on the subject.
'That's why I called you.
'Lf this man is an impostor,
why should he assume that name? '
He wouldn't, not if he were sane.
In Transylvania,
the name is associated only with evil.
I advise you to be very careful of that man.
From your tone, I gather you don't disbelieve
the legends of the former Dracula.
In my research, I have uncovered data
which I cannot entirely disprove.
I do not say I believe but, in honesty,
I cannot say I disbelieve.
I repeat, be very, very careful of that man.
I will, Professor. Thank you very much.
Goodbye, sir.
This will is a comparatively
simple document,
as you two girls are
the only living kin of Colonel Caldwell.
It divides the entire estate,
cash, securities, evenly between...
Pardon me, Judge Simmons.
May I ask the date of that will?
August 24. It was made on the occasion
of Miss Claire's attaining legal age.
Then there's a will of a later date.
There's no important difference
between them.
There's an important difference
for you, Kay.
According to this,
you get nothing but the plantation.
Claire gets all cash and securities.
It's properly witnessed
and can't be disputed
but I can't imagine what
your father was thinking of.
It's the way I wanted it.
To divide the estate otherwise
would mean selling the plantation.
I love Dark Oaks
and hope to live here always.
But my dear child, it takes real capital
to operate a plantation of this size.
Don't worry, Judge. I think
Colonel Caldwell knew what he was doing.
Oh, I see.
Well, I'd offer my congratulations
but this hardly seems the proper time.
That seems to end the matter.
I'll start the legal machinery
in motion at once.
In fact, I'll start it today
if the clerk's office is still open.
Goodbye. Oh, don't bother, Claire.
- I'll find my way out.
- Goodbye, Judge.
I can't understand how
you've got along without servants.
I take it that none
have returned since that night.
No, but I'll arrange for others
if I find I need them.
Well, of course,
you know what you want to do.
Come along, Claire.
Let's leave these two alone for a while.
I'll see you again before I leave.
I feel sorry for Frank.
I'm afraid he's living in a fool's paradise.
- A fool's paradise?
- I'm certain Kay won't marry him.
- What's the trouble? Count Alucard?
- Oh, she couldn't marry him.
There's something repulsive about him.
The way he came in the night
Father died and... I don't know.
I understand he left immediately.
At least that was decent of him.
Yes, but...
I'm positive Kay's been seeing him secretly.
Why do you say that?
A couple of nights ago,
I heard them talking in the hall downstairs.
Somehow I didn't like the idea and I went
to the head of the stairs to make sure.
- And?
- Kay was alone in the lower hall
but she was looking up at me as if...
Well, as if she'd been caught
at something she wasn't proud of.
I see.
Did you mention it to her?
Yes, but she pooh-poohed the idea,
said I was dreaming.
I let it go at that but I wasn't dreaming.
I hadn't been asleep.
That does sound strange.
Have you been in the guesthouse
since your father died?
- No, but you don't think Count Alucard...
- I don't know what to think!
He couldn't be living in town
without my knowing it.
I'd like a look at his belongings,
if he hasn't taken them away.
He couldn't have done that alone,
they were too heavy.
This might be a very good time.
Two large chests as well as the trunks
came on the train.
I don't know what's become of them.
They were put in here.
That's strange. They're not in there either.
Well, it may not be ethical,
but there are reasons why
we ought to find out more about the Count.
- He didn't have any hand bags.
- I don't like it, Claire.
He can't be travelling around
with only the clothes he's wearing.
See what I meant about Frank and Kay?
I don't like it, Claire. I don't like it one bit!
You leave here and go back to town,
the sooner the better.
You sound as if I was
in some kind of danger.
I'd rather not go into that
but I insist upon your leaving.
You can go in with me
and send for your things later.
I can't leave Kay alone.
If I'm in danger, she must be too.
I'll make one last attempt
to persuade her to leave. If she won't...
Well, if she won't, I want you to join me
in swearing out
an insanity complaint against her.
An insanity complaint?
Are you serious? Kay's my sister!
Claire, everybody's in danger here,
Kay more than anyone else.
If she won't leave voluntarily,
we've got to force her.
Yes, but she'd be arrested,
put in an asylum! I'd never do that to her.
Don't you see?
We've got to protect Kay from herself.
(Engine starts)
Yes, what is it?
You remember me, don't you, Mr Kirby?
Yes. You're Colonel Caldwell's daughter.
Sorry to hear about your father.
Thank you. May we come in?
We want to be married.
Married?
Yes, of course. Come right in.
Ma! Cecilia!
In a few moments, my dear,
you will become Countess Alucard.
(Wind whistling)
(Thunder crashes)
Everything has worked out as we planned.
This house is ours.
No one else has any claim on it.
I like old houses and I like your countryside
and the swampland.
- It's very different from your homeland.
- That is why I like it.
My land is dry and desolate.
The soil is red
with the blood of a hundred races.
There is no life left there.
Here you have a young and vital race.
You've spoken of your people
but I want to know more -
their legends, their mystery, their gifts.
Perhaps someday we may return there.
As I have told you, my dear,
ours will be a different life,
without material needs,
a life that will last through eternity.
(Knocking)
I'll see who it is.
(Knocking continues)
I told you not to come here again. I'm sorry.
Please, Kay. I've got to talk to you.
Kay, I must know what this is all about.
I know you and Alucard are meeting
secretly. I followed you tonight.
- I don't know where you went, I lost you.
- We went to Mr Kirby's...
and were married.
Married? No. No, you couldn't have!
I told you before, we were married tonight.
You'll save us all a lot of unpleasantness
by coming with me
and taking the first train out in the morning.
I'm afraid I do not understand.
I'll make it clear.
You're going back to town with me.
You'll take the first train out.
Kay will have the marriage annulled
and if you show up here again,
you'll be jailed!
Kay!
(Squeaking)
(Slow knocking)
Frank!
My boy!
Harry...
How did I get here?
Did you bring me here from Dark Oaks?
No, you came alone, a few minutes ago.
What's happened, Frank?
Harry...
Harry.
Harry, I've killed Kay!
It's all mixed up but I know I shot her twice.
Am I insane? Could I have shot through
Alucard and killed her without hurting him?
- Tell me what happened.
- Well, I shot right through him.
I shot right through him!
Kay screamed and fell
and he just stood there.
Just stood there, staring at me.
Just staring at me!
You don't believe that, do you?
Nobody will.
Yes, I believe you.
Have you got your revolver?
- I dropped it in the drive.
- You haven't told me what happened.
- Kay and Alucard were married.
- Didn't you try to stop the wedding?
A tree smashed my car and I lost them.
I went to Dark Oaks and I found them there
and got in a fight with him.
He got me by the throat.
It was like one of those crazy nightmares
where you can't move or struggle or...
I'd no more strength against him
than a baby. He just threw me aside.
Then I fired. The bullets went through him
without even hurting him...
- and killed Kay.
- What did you do then?
I don't know! I just seemed to be
running and falling...
Oh, I don't know anything
except I found myself here.
I don't even know if it's real!
- Shh.
- Maybe it's a nightmare!
Just rest yourself for a while, Frank.
We'll find out just how much of it happened.
Here. Drink this.
Lie down, Frank.
(Knocks)
(Creaking)
(Clucking)
(Creaking)
(Alucard) May I inquire
what you are doing here?
I was about to ask you the same question.
Tonight Miss Caldwell and I were married.
I am now master of this house.
You see, you owe me an explanation.
I came to see Katherine. The door
was open, she didn't answer my call
and I thought I heard somebody in the cellar.
I, too, thought that
I heard someone in the cellar.
Come.
(Knocks)
Dr Brewster, what on earth
brings you here this time of night?
I hope nothing's happened to Claire.
No. No, she was worried
that something had happened to you.
I'm sorry.
- Count Alucard and I were married tonight.
- So the Count told me.
It was the way we wanted it, quiet and alone.
That's the way we're going to live.
You see, I'm engaged in
some scientific research.
It will take up all of our daylight hours.
And we'll have no time for social life.
- We want you to explain this to Claire.
- And to Frank.
I'm fond of Frank.
But of course
he must never come here again.
I'd like you to tell all our friends not to come.
If Judge Simmons has papers for us to sign,
tell him to bring them in the evening.
Katherine is going to assist me
in my research.
I see.
Well, there doesn't seem to be
any more for me to say,
so if you'll pardon me,
Katherine, I'll be leaving.
- Good night.
- Goodbye, Doctor,
and say goodbye to Frank.
Perhaps I should emphasise
some of Katherine's wishes.
When I came to Dark Oaks,
I was not graciously welcomed.
Now the position has changed. I am master.
Anyone who enters here
without my permission
will be considered a trespasser.
Good morning, Sarah.
Will you set another place, please?
For Mr Stanley.
He slept on the couch last night.
There's nobody in there now, sir.
There's a blanket on the couch
but no sign of Mr Frank.
Why didn't you put him
in the spare bedroom?
No wonder he never stayed for breakfast.
I'll just take coffee this morning, Sarah.
(Urgent knocking)
Good morning, Judge.
It's Judge Simmons, Doctor.
(Harry) Give Sarah your coat
and have some breakfast.
I'll keep my coat on.
I can only stay a minute.
- Quite a rain we had.
- Yes, started about four.
- Claire isn't here yet?
- No.
No, I expect her any minute, though.
I was up most of the night studying that
insanity complaint you got for Katherine.
What did you decide?
Well, if I didn't know you,
I'd be suspicious of your motives.
You have no evidence of insanity, Harry.
The fact she wants to live alone at
Dark Oaks may be eccentric but that's all.
And her infatuation for this count,
even if he's an impostor,
that may be bad judgment
but it couldn't be construed as insanity.
They were married last night by Kirby.
- Oh...
- (Telephone)
I'm sorry to hear that.
Katherine's like a niece to me.
You're wanted on the phone, Judge.
It's Mrs Simmons, sir.
She says it's important.
- You'd better take it in my office, Judge.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Yes?
Yes, dear.
What?
Yes. Well, I'll go right over
to the courthouse.
Goodbye.
Frank Stanley's surrendered to the sheriff.
Told some story about killing Katherine.
That's not so, Judge. I know.
He came here in a delirious condition
and told me the same story.
I gave him a sedative
and I drove out to Dark Oaks.
I talked to Katherine
long after Frank said he'd killed her.
Well, you'd better come
to the courthouse and tell them that.
Sarah?
Professor Lazlo is arriving
from Memphis on the morning train.
He's spending a few days here.
Make him comfortable, will you?
- Morning, Bob.
- Good morning.
Come in.
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Morning, Coroner.
- Where's Frank?
- The deputy's fetching him.
- We're going to Dark Oaks.
- That won't be necessary.
Dr Brewster says that Frank is insane.
I talked to Katherine
after Frank was supposed to have shot her.
What? Well, I'm going to Dark Oaks anyway
and talk to them myself.
No need of going till evening.
They'll be away all day.
Yeah? Where will they be?
I don't know, but they told me
to tell Claire they wouldn't be home.
I'll take Frank out anyway.
Maybe he'll come to his senses
if we make him go over the ground.
I wish you wouldn't do that. Frank has had
a shock. He needs complete relaxation.
Frank has confessed to murder.
I have to act on it.
It won't hurt him to ride out there.
- I give you my word that it will.
- That's too bad!
Money and position don't rate him
any better treatment than anyone else.
- Did he act crazy to you, Dr Peters?
- Can't say that he did.
A little irrational, maybe,
same as anyone after committin' murder.
You can come along, Doc.
If everything's all right,
I'll forget all about the confession.
Funny that they'd leave the door open.
Anyone here?
Where were you when you shot Katherine
and where were she and her husband?
There's nothing to worry about.
Enact the scene
just as you think it happened.
It was in the library.
I seem to remember running out there
and dropping the gun.
- Are you sure you didn't leave in your car?
- I couldn't have.
I remember a tree fell on it
while I was following Kay and Alucard.
- About what time was that?
- It's all so mixed up.
I just don't know
but I'm sure I went out that way.
Come on, Frank.
Suppose you show us just where.
I was here but I don't remember
anything after that.
Remember this, Frank?
(Creaking)
We'd better go back to the office, Doctor,
while you do some explaining.
Kay! Kay, my darling!
(Sobbing)
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Has Professor Lazlo arrived?
Yes, sir. He's been in and out all day.
Can I fix you something to eat?
The Professor's had his dinner.
No, thanks.
- Professor, I am glad to see you.
- I heard about last night.
I called at the courthouse
but they wouldn't let me see you.
- Step inside.
- Thank you.
The sheriff believes I'm an accessory
after the fact in the murder of Katherine.
- I can't say that I blame him.
- Why?
He can't believe that I spoke to Katherine
after Frank shot her
and as I urged him to keep away
from Dark Oaks
he thinks I intended to hide her body.
- But he didn't arrest you?
- No.
He questioned me most of the day
but he's not ready to hold me.
Then, you didn't tell him what we believe?
The chances of convincing the sheriff
he was dealing with a vampire seemed slim.
Very.
And yet I am satisfied that such is the case.
Alucard is undoubtedly a vampire.
Probably a descendant of Count Dracula.
Are you sure we're not allowing
our imagination to run away with us?
Can you suggest any other explanation
for the events of the past few days?
No.
Neither can I give
a lucid explanation of a vampire.
Broadly speaking,
a vampire is an earthbound spirit
whose body comes to life at night
and scours the countryside,
satisfying a ravenous appetite
for the blood of the living.
This it does by drawing it
from the throat of its victim.
That's a nauseating thought.
They're supposed to be immortals,
no doubt?
Practically. So long as they return
to their graves before sunrise.
Between then and sunset
they remain in a sort of... cataleptic state
during which they can be destroyed
by two different means.
At night, however, they are invulnerable.
You believe Frank shot through Alucard
without hurting him?
(Chuckles) Bullets would have had
no effect on him.
It's strange to hear a man
of science like yourself
calmly admit that he believes
in a superstition so fantastic.
I could spend days citing proof
that it is not mere superstition.
My homeland in the Carpathian hills
where Count Dracula lived
is sad testimony to its truth.
What was once a happy, productive region
is today barren waste.
Villages depopulated, the land abandoned.
Maybe that's why he left and came to
a younger country, stronger and more virile.
Of course. And he will fasten on it
and drain it dry, just as he did his homeland.
Unless we can find his grave
and destroy him in it.
His grave?
He was buried in Hungary, wasn't he?
Yes, but one of the chests he brought will
contain a layer of soil from his birthplace.
That constitutes a grave.
Are you serious?
Oh, he has it hidden in some safe place
and returns to it
just before sunrise every morning.
Our job seems to be to find that chest
with him in it and destroy him.
That won't be as simple as it sounds.
The vampire can assume
very many different forms at will.
Sometimes it appears as a bat,
sometimes as a werewolf
and sometimes as
a small cloud of swirling vapour.
In this way it can move unseen
among its enemies,
learn their plans
and be in a position to outwit them.
You are very brilliant,
aren't you, Professor Lazlo?
Perhaps too brilliant for your own good...
and that of Dr Brewster.
You are right.
I am here because this is
a young and virile race,
not dry and decadent like ours.
They have what I want,
what I need, what I must have.
Do you suppose that I would allow
any mortal to stand in my way?
Here, drink this.
Thanks.
This doesn't leave me much room
to go on disputing your theories.
How in the world did you drive him away?
I showed him this.
A simple cross!
It would take too long to explain why
they fear it but they do.
Keep this and wear it at all times,
especially in your sleep.
Dracula has you marked for death.
Not only me but unsuspecting people
in this district
who'd never believe us
if we tried to warn them.
- We must destroy him before it's too...
- (Knocking)
Excuse me, Dr Harry,
but it's Mrs Land to see you.
- Something's happened to Tommy, Doctor.
- Put him here.
I sent him to my sister's on an errand.
He was gone so long
I finally went after him.
- Will you get my bag?
- Certainly.
I found him lying beside the road.
He talked a little but he didn't make sense.
He acted like he was scared foolish.
He said something about
a foreign man in a fog,
but there wasn't any fog tonight, Doctor.
I noticed those wounds on his neck too.
What are they? Small animal bites?
No, I don't think so.
We can fix that very easily.
Sarah?
Yes, Doctor?
Why don't you make Mrs Land a cup of tea?
- Go along with Sarah, Mrs Land.
- Yes, sir.
Tommy'll be all right.
He's had a bit of a shock.
I want him to stay here
until he regains consciousness.
Thank you, Doctor.
Dracula's first victim. It's starting fast.
Does that mean that Tommy's in danger
of becoming a vampire?
No, unless Alucard drained
so much blood from him that he died.
What about Kay?
She died from bullet wounds yet you implied
that she'd become a vampire.
Yes, but her case was different.
- Her background was...
- I know, morbid!
She'd gone overboard on the supernatural,
black magic and the like.
Exactly. I rather believe that Miss Caldwell
may have made the transition... from choice.
(Tuts) No one could choose
a thing so loathsome.
Don't forget, the girl was morbid.
That means thanatophobia, fear of death.
And Alucard could promise her eternal life.
Eternal life at such a price?
Why do you think she is a vampire?
The dirt which I understand
had been thrown into her grave,
who else would have done that
except Alucard - Dracula?
That means we have to destroy her as well?
That should be relatively simple.
Her sister could order her cremation
while the body is still in the morgue.
Perhaps you're right.
(Telephone)
Hello. Oh, hello, Claire.
I was just about to call you.
No, I think that'll be perfectly safe.
Professor Lazlo and I will pick you up.
It's no trouble. Besides, there's something
we want to talk to you about.
All right. See you in a few minutes, then.
The sheriff's office just called her.
Frank is still a bit irrational
and insists upon seeing her.
While she's there, she can leave orders
for Katherine's cremation.
Sarah?
Mrs Land?
Unfortunately, I have to run along.
In a few minutes,
it'll be safe to take Tommy home.
- Don't you worry, he'll be all right.
- Thank you, Doctor.
(Kay) Frank.
Frank.
Frank.
Kay.
- No, it can't be.
- Yes, Frank, it's Katherine.
No, you can't be Kay.
Kay's dead!
I know, I killed her. I saw her fall.
I was with the sheriff
when he found her body.
She was dead. I saw her!
You see me now too.
- Yes, but...
- Do you doubt your own eyes?
It is you.
It is you, Kay, and you're alive!
But what is it, Kay?
You seem to be cold, like death.
You seem to be Kay but there's a difference.
It's almost as if I didn't know you.
- Does that mean you no longer love me?
- I'll always love you.
Enough to spend the rest
of your life with me?
But you're married to Alucard.
I don't love him. I never did.
- But you're married to him!
- I had to.
It was part of the plan
I told you about in the garden.
I asked you to have faith in me then.
I beg you to have faith in me now.
I don't understand.
Count Alucard is immortal.
Through him, I attained immortality.
Through me, you will do the same
and we will spend eternity together.
Are you serious? Do you expect me
to believe anything so unreal?
How else can you explain the fact
you shot through him without hurting him?
How else could I be here?
Why, I can't explain it. It's...
It's so incredible!
Perhaps you'll understand when I tell you
Count Alucard's real name
is Count Dracula.
Count Dracula? You mean the Hungarian
who's supposed to have become...
Don't use that word, Frank. We don't like it.
Say, rather, that we are undead.
Immortal.
You deliberately planned this?
You married him so you could become...
So you and I could attain immortality, yes.
But even if it would work,
do you expect me to agree
to anything so fantastic?
You have no choice.
I've taken the first step
while you were sleeping.
No. No, I can't do it.
I've already told you,
you have no choice.
Frank, isn't eternity together
better than a few years of ordinary life?
Yes.
Yes, I suppose it is.
There's one thing you must do
while you're still in your present form.
- What is that?
- Destroy Dracula.
Destroy Dracula?
But how?
There is one advantage
all humans have over us.
You can move about in the daytime.
We can't.
We must return to our graves
before sunrise or we're destroyed.
But how can I keep him from his grave?
You don't have to.
You can destroy him in one of two ways.
Either drive a stake through his heart
or burn his grave before he reaches it.
You must do this, Frank, for us.
Miss Caldwell! It got so late
I didn't think you were coming in.
I thought you might have told Frank
and I didn't want to disappoint him.
- I don't suppose we're allowed to see him?
- Sheriff says no.
Find out if he knows where Count Alucard
keeps himself during the day.
I'll try.
(Door unlocks)
(Jailer) Third one on your left.
- Hello, Frank.
- Hello, Claire.
It's nice of you to come, after everything.
I can only stay a few minutes.
I just wanted to tell you
that I know it was an accident.
That makes me feel better.
Kay understands too.
I'm sure she does.
I know it because she...
Would you think I was losing my mind
if I told you that Kay has been to talk to me?
I'd be more likely to say
you'd been dreaming.
Yes, I guess you're right.
I was dreaming.
You know, they'll never convict
Stanley of that killing.
- No?
- No!
He's as nutty as a filbert.
He's been back there
talking to some dame who wasn't there.
First he talks in his voice
then he answers in the woman's voice.
Did you... Did you hear anything
that was said?
That'd be a swell way
to spend a rainy evening -
eavesdropping on some goof
talking to himself in two voices.
Some fun.
Dr Brewster's doing all he can
for you, Frank.
All he can do is get me out of here
on an insanity plea.
- That shouldn't be hard.
- You mustn't think such things.
Why not? I can't be sane.
I really believe Kay came here to talk to me.
If that's not crazy...
When are they going to hold the funeral?
We haven't been able to contact
Count Alucard so far.
Do you happen to know
where he stays during the day?
Why during the day?
It's an unpleasant trip out there at night
and there's no phone.
Why should anyone think I know?
You saw him meet Kay on the road once
and I wondered if you saw
where he came from?
I'm sorry. I don't know anything.
I suppose you'll be burying her
at Dark Oaks?
Yes, I think so.
At least her ashes will be taken there.
- Her ashes?
- Yes.
I'm going to leave an order
for her cremation.
You can't do that.
You can't do that, I tell you!
She isn't dead. I know! She talked to me!
You can't cremate her, it'd kill her.
- You can't burn her now she's immortal!
- (Claire) Don't excite yourself.
(Claire) You must accept that Kay is dead.
(Frank) But I know she isn't dead!
- Let her go.
- But she isn't dead!
All right, Frank.
I think you'd better leave, Miss Caldwell.
- You must listen to me.
- Frank, try and get some sleep.
Good night, Frank.
Kay.
Kay!
Did you hear? They're going to cremate you.
Yes, I heard. That means Dr Brewster
has guessed the truth.
- We may have to eliminate him and Claire.
- No! Not your own sister.
She's no longer my sister
when she interferes with me.
(Frank) But if they cremate you...
(Kay) They won't find me.
I'll go to Dark Oaks tonight.
But we'll never be safe
as long as Dr Brewster's alive.
(Frank) Our first worry's Alucard.
If only I could get out of here.
I'll get you out but
you won't have to hunt for Alucard.
- I know where he is in the daytime.
- Where?
Remember the drainage flume
near the edge of the swamp?
- Yes.
- That's the place.
- But don't get there until after the sun is up.
- (Door creaks)
- Didn't I tell you to get some sleep?
- I couldn't go to sleep.
I was talking to someone.
Yeah.
Well, she's gone now
so I'll just douse the lights.
I'll wait for you at Dark Oaks in the playroom
Claire and I used to have in the attic.
I'll unlock the cell and bring you a gun.
There is very little doubt in my mind
that Kay has visited Frank in his cell
and I'm afraid for one very definite purpose.
What purpose?
Didn't you tell me that she and Frank
have always been in love?
Ever since they were children. Why?
Well, it's an unpleasant thought
but there are cases on record
where the living have voluntarily joined
the ranks of the undead
in order to consummate
what might be called... an unholy alliance.
You can't be serious!
Such a pact between
Kay and Frank is unthinkable!
Perhaps.
But so long as there is
the remotest possibility, and I insist there is,
we must arrange for immediate cremation.
Otherwise she will destroy
her own soul and Frank's.
- Frank!
- Get back! Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!
Frank! Frank Stanley!
- What happened?
- Frank just escaped. He's armed.
Get after him. If you have to shoot, do it.
(Car engine revs)
- What happened?
- How'd he get out?
I don't know, Sheriff.
The keys were on the desk as usual.
Now they're gone and so is Stanley.
I tried to stop him...
- Did you have anything to do with this?
- Certainly not!
We are as anxious as you are
to keep him locked up.
More so. Did you hear him
do any more talking to that girl?
- What girl?
- Katherine Caldwell.
- Katherine Cald...
- It's some kind of a crazy trick Stanley pulls.
He pretends to be talking to some girl,
first in his voice, then in hers.
Is this some trick so he'd sound crazy?
- Did you listen in as we asked you to?
- Yeah.
- But it was too crazy to bother about.
- For instance?
Well, the girl's voice said something
about getting him out of jail.
(Lazlo) That wasn't so crazy,
was it? He's out.
That's right.
I never thought of that.
- Do you think someone was in there?
- Never mind that.
What else did he say, however crazy it was?
She said something about meeting him
at Dark Oaks in some kid playroom.
- I know where it is. What else?
- Some crazy stuff about killing Alucard.
Did he say kill him or destroy him?
Come to think of it,
I believe he did say destroy.
Shove a stake through him or something.
- Shove a stake through him?
- Yeah.
- We're dealing with a madman.
- Obviously.
Did he say anything about
where he expected to find Alucard?
Yeah, but that really was crazy. Something
about a swamp with a drainage tunnel.
I know where that is.
We'll warn Alucard before Frank gets there.
You'll not warn him
if we have to lock you up in jail.
- What's that?
- There's a lot you don't understand.
If you doubt it,
let's take a look in that morgue.
- What's the morgue got to do with it?
- Never mind.
- It's becoming as plain as day.
- It has been to me for some time.
Then let's go take a look in that morgue.
- The coffin is gone, corpse and all!
- Of course.
- You sound as if you expected it.
- We did.
What's your part in this?
How do you know what's happening?
We'd better get to Alucard.
We'll explain it on the way.
- I thought you weren't gonna warn Alucard.
- We're not.
But we may have to save Frank from
the Count and from his own madness.
The farther we go, the crazier you sound.
Well! It is seldom that my enemies
are so accommodating.
How did you learn where to find me?
I know all about you.
You're not Count Alucard
but Count Dracula, one of the undead.
A loathsome thing,
surviving on the blood of the living.
There'll be no more blood
of the living for you
because I'm going to destroy you.
If you had learned more about me,
you wouldn't have come here
until after sunrise.
Now it is not I
that is going to be destroyed.
Put it out!
Put it out, do you hear me?
Put it out!
Put it out!
Put it out!
You stay here, Jack.
- This is one thing we didn't foresee.
- How could we?
I don't get it. What's happened?
To maintain his existence
among the undead,
Dracula had to be back
in his coffin before sunrise.
Frank prevented it, as you can see.
- You mean, that's all that's left of Alucard?
- Look at the ring on his hand.
It bears the Alucard seal,
just as on his luggage.
Assuming it is Alucard or Dracula
or whoever, where is Frank Stanley?
- He's still wanted for murder.
- Do you think Frank killed Kay deliberately?
Look, Doctor, I'm only the sheriff.
I'm not the judge.
I bring him in
and the court decides if he's guilty.
But I think our testimony
will have bearing on their decision.
Undoubtedly. But the main thing
to do now is to find Frank
and I think I know where he is.
(Fire crackling)
