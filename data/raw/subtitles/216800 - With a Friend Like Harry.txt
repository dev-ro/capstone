Patient has Pneumothorax
but is trapped under the panel
There are no doctors
we can't perform aspiration
Send the emergency unit here now
Help me!
I can't perform aspiration, doctor!
BP 170/100, pulse 100, SAO270
Help!
I'll lose my license
I... won't make it
I'm sorry
Stay where you are!
You may lose your job, but remember
you saved someone's life
Breathing is steady, BP 170/80
pulse 80, SAO295
No hospital is like that! Ridiculous!
Dr. Wong!
Thanks!
This place requires forms for everything
You're lucky to have Dr. Wong
supervising you!
He's a good teacher
This is for first visit,
this is for blood test
and this is for X-ray
These two are the most important
Claim forms for meal and transportation
The hospital has a liability system
so write intelligibly
then no one can sue you for malpractice
What?
I... Ho Kau Kei
Yes, you're at the Ho Kau Kei Hospital
What happened to him?
Got hit by lightning
What would you do, Dr. Ho?
Take his blood pressure and SAO2
Check his optic nerve for any damage
Check for facial palsy
Most likely he won't make it
If he died in the A & E,
there is report to write
and maybe a law suit to settle
We should send him away
You know where to?
Surgery!
Dr. Ma is on duty there
He's too busy watching horse races
to treat anyone
Orthopedics' Dr. Yau &I can't get along
so he's out
The only one left is the old maid
at General Medicine
I heard she's in love,
been in good mood lately
She'll take the patient
Take him away!
Got hit by lightning at this age
must've done some bad things
I've done good deeds!
I know you're a scum
No internal injury, Surgery!
This is what a lightning victim look like
God will punish you for doing
bad things
I've done good deeds!
Stop explaining yourself!
Forget it! Take him to Orthopedics
Why is he here if his bones are fine?
Surgery!
He was just there
Then General Medicine
He was there too
Take him back to the A & E
Aren't you ashamed of shoving
an old man to different departments?
How about that hemorrhoids patient
You sent here last time?
Your department has openings
you should treat everyone!
Orthopedics is
not A & E's dumpster
You can't just send people up
My diagnosis comes from careful
thinking and examination
I know what I'm doing
He has no fractures,
not even a spondylitis
How about his bone density level?
Why don't you say a fish bone
got stuck in his throat?
Time to leave!
Left-over from the last shift
push him aside
He looks familiar
Every dying old man looks just like this
Send him up
You're in the way, old fart!
Move!
It stinks!
He's burnt
Old man, elevator maintenance,
take a breather
I only did good deeds, nothing bad
It's okay, being struck by lightning
is a natural phenomenon
When the atmosphere acquires
sufficient electricity
A discharge of electricity will strike
an object on the ground
Those people have no sense
You're a good man
Sorry, I'm just a new doctor
This is all I can do
Next time I'll give you a room
Brown-nosers!
This is the reality:
You kiss ass to those about you
How many doctors are actually impartial
and committed?
Let's eat!
Don't let go of your hands!
Go on hitting me if you like, Sir Ho
I can take it
Don't like your food?
Order something else!
It's your treat anyway
When did he last eat?
Call for help! AMI!
Doesn't look like chest pain,
could be asthma!
It's pouring outside!
His face is turning red, he's choking
He smells! I can't get any closer
I've never smelled anything this bad
Well done!
I feel itchy just by the brief contact
Observe carefully, girl.
This is an example of medical ethics!
It's like a miracle!
What a pity!
He'll probably make it!
She's too busy for dinner
We'll have it wrapped to go
The food's cold,
I'll get her another order
She barely touched her steak
Maybe she'll like pork chop!
I'll get her hot coffee
With little sugar
Are you okay, mister? You all right?
He was choking.
Had no pulse and heart beat
I performed CPR. There's pulse now
but very weak
So he's fine!
We won't take him then
I just had the car cleaned!
Let me... Get in
Al, don't take him to Ho Kau Kei!
You did good, I'm very pleased
I'm not, you're not fit to be a doctor
8 years ago, I came to the hospital
for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, nice body too
If the scar doesn't allow her
to wear bikinis
ruins her chance to marry a good family
her life will be meaningless!
She's 14, 5 ft. 1
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen
makes up 1/3 of the human body
If we cut 1 inch lower,
her pants will hide the scar
But this raises
the operation's difficulty
Difficulty is not an issue
The patient's future is what counts
It's not easy to be a doctor!
It's not easy to be a doctor
I became a doctor because of
what you said
But look at you now, look at your hair!
It's all greasy, what a mess!
And now you drive a Volvo,
afraid you may die?
I really miss you driving your GTR
and your spiky hair-do
He's fired up!
That gets him going!
Sir Ho, someone attacked you?
Who did?
I started the fight
Those morons don't know better
The 7F Management should go to hell!
They only wanted my money,
not my suggestions
So I attacked them with
Shaolin Kung-Fu!
They still tried to fight back
I knocked them down with the
Shadow Kick
I beat them under the ground
I dare them to talk back at me
What are you doing?
Plugging your tubes back
Kid, don't move around
when I'm talking to you
I want to reform the hospital
but there's no one to trust
I believe in you. You're the answer!
I can't, I'm new here
I'm ninety-something and
you won't help me
where's your compassion?
I'd love to help
but I can't change the system myself
Okay, who do you have in mind?
Say it, I'll write it down
Nothing at this moment
Say it
Where are you going?
I think I've got the answer!
Who is it?
Who made this mess?
Accident at a construction site
Fracture in the left thigh,
multiple lacerations
Conscious Index 10, BP 10/50
Pulse 110
1, 2, 3
Cross match, CBP, ECG, SAO2
Everything ready
Forceps!
Hypodermoclysis,
4 units of unmatched blood
Blood plasma full rate,
check for any internal bleeding
I need a hand!
A shot of ampoules, Defibrillator!
200! Clear!
I had it, it was all right
Did you watch TV last night?
The show was so lame!
Give me a coffee
Any sugar?
A little
Listen to the radio now
It's hard to be a good doctor
in this hospital!
Forceps!
I need a hand!
It's alcohol!
200!
Clear!
Should we go find him?
Rescue Center
Rectification
Emergency Check-up
Supersonic Welding
Give me a 23
Brake fluid 200cc, engine oil 4 liters
Battery water 40cc
accumulator plate 10cc
Clear! Start the engine!
Joe!
How is it coming?
I welded back the chassis
How many more years can the car go?
The parts I repaired should give you
another 10 years
Thank you! We'll go in and take a look
Joe! It's different this time
Think about it, we've got Sir Ho
I won't go back
Don't be so cold, help me out here!
Prepare the Rescue Center
Just this once!
Hurry!
Leave
If this is the way you are,
I'll stay here until you say yes!
Fine, see how long you'll last
Don't leave me here
Damage all over. Rocker arm is wasted
so is the ball bearing & the suspension
Get me a screw,
and remove the connecting rod
It hurts
Your determination can't last 3 minutes
We've been friends for so long, let it go
I really made up my mind, trust me!
You never follow through with
anything in your life
We gave our resignation
when the hospital demanded reform
But you handed in a Christmas card!
Stay there!
8 years ago, I came to the hospital
for Appendicitis
Pretty girl, good body
If the scar doesn't allow her
to wear bikinis
and ruins her chance to marry
a good family
Her life will be meaningless1
She's 14, 5ft, 1
Should grow 3 more inches
Proportionally the abdomen makes
of 1/3 of the human body
If we cut one inch lower,
her pants can hide the scar
But the operation will be more difficult!
Difficulty is not the issue
What matters is the patient's future!
Remember, it's not easy to be a doctor!
It's not easy to be a doctor
I became a doctor because of
what you said
That's not what you told me
A good doctor like you repairing cars?
You have to fix my car
it belongs to my boss
I like saving cars more than saving lives
What happened?
You may fool others,
but you can't fool yourself
This place looks just like an A & E
So where is your heart at?
Air compression 40%,
get me a pump and a drill
You will come back!
You have to help me out
You said last time I was the reason
you became a doctor
Yeah
Back there you said it was
because of Joe
Yeah
So who really inspired you?
It's not important who inspired me
What matters is who I will marry
What are you talking about?
Don't laugh at what I'm about to say
I can't promise how I will react
That time when I underwent
the operation
I had a crush on you guys
and wanted to marry you
But I can't be married to two guys
at once
So I decided to marry whoever
that said It's not easy to be a doctor
Don't laugh, I'm serious!
But I was drugged at the time,
feeling unconscious
couldn't figure out who said the words
Good, everyone's here
I hope you can tell me what you think
Say something!
You first, Benz
You know the answer already
Are you for it, Mitsubishi?
The girl made some good points
She's hot!
When she pulled down her panty
Don't go!
Don't be like that! Stop crying!
You can't just go and leave us here
You're crazy! Irresponsible!
Calm down!
Golf, we can't be selfish
This is a garage after all
Joe has been a doctor all his life!
Go back, Joe
Thanks
Thanks
Someone attacked you again?
Who did? No good!
I started the fight!
The management bastards
on the 7th floor
said I can't hire people,
won't let me sign you
So I attacked them using
the Mantis Stance
Signit! I fought very hard to get this
Kid, you're sitting on my tube
I'm ninety-something and
you won't help me?
Where's your compassion?
Won't be easy to change things
There's Andy, Leon and the gang
Plus the Management Rats are
spying on us
What? Those Rats again?
I'll talk care of them!
Okay, but you have to promise me
don't die on us before we succeed
Sure! Signit!
After being struck by lightning
last month at the Peak
Philanthropist Sir Ho was found
at the same place this morning
He was burnt and his condition
was critical
Police believes that Sir Ho returned
to the Peak for Kung-fu training
When lightning hit him again
This is worse than last time!
Sir Ho
Poor old man got stuck by
lightning twice
He probably won't wake up again
Maybe we should
No! This is Sir Ho's last wish
We have to fulfill it for him!
How?
We can't win the fight without
his support
Sir Ho is ninety-something and
you won't help him?
Where's your compassion?
Sir Ho manages to stay alive
He kept his promise, and so should we!
Thwart their plan
They're really sneaky!
His face is pale, must be anemic
I heard they haven't left the room
for years
What a pity, working in dark
could result in amblyopia
Sorry, sorry!
Besides triage
if the A & E can help any patient,
we'll do it ourselves
Every shift is 8 hours, you can't be late
Good morning!
What are we discussing now?
Being on-time!
Really?
No unexcused absence
We have to go now, bye!
Bye! Have a good time
You have one hour to eat
No food is allowed while you're
on duty
Delivery!
I ordered it! Over here please!
I'm starving
No phone calls during operation
Hello? I'm busy now listening
to nonsense
I'll call you from the OR later
Meeting adjourned
Hold there!
You are new here, so listen carefully:
Use the first urinal to finish business,
not the other ones
Cleaning all of them is too much work,
trying to kill me?
You clean up your own spots!
Meeting adjourned!
You call this a hospital?
Doctors don't save lives
Cleaning ladies don't clean
That's not all
Maintenance guys
don't maintain appliances
Yeah! Pharmacists don't fill prescriptions
filing assistants don't file papers
That's not the worse!
Canteen serves cold coffee
soda machine dispenses warm drinks
We'll do it ourselves!
Does it work? The stock you
Recommended lost all values
Don't worry, the owner is my friend
He said to hold on to them
How is it, doctor?
Sorry, we did everything we can
Don't cry
We'll try again, let's go!
Take it away!
It can't be done
How can you revive the dead?
I just unplugged the instruments
No breathing, no heartbeat
I'll do it
By the order of the Highest
Management
3 doctors can't work on one patient
at once
This is against cost effectiveness
Be aware... Be aware
Terrible, more ribs are cracked
He should let the guy rest in peace
Yeah
...but an important reminder:
According to the Service Agreement
300!
Every patient gets 5 minutes of
resuscitation procedure
You've exceeded the time
hundreds of patients will be affected
This is a BBQ. I can smell the char
The mortician will have a hard time
touching up the body
One unit of Type O negative is $200
One injection is $1000
Every pack of cotton balls is $30
More cotton
He really won't give up
until the corpse is destroyed
He should at least show respect
for the family
In order to balance the earnings
and expenses
we'll either fire medical staff
or reduce medical supplies
Over-budget, overtime, over-budget,
overtime
We've got pulse!
Put him on Dopamine
Loser!
Bastard!
Doctor, it's okay
Are you done? Hurry up!
We've got patients waiting!
How's my son, doctor?
He's got heartbeat
we're taking him to the OR
I love you!
I saved you because it's what I do
it doesn't mean I love you
Why not?
I don't like beggars
A rival!
What?
Did Yan say who she's going to marry?
What are you talking about?
She made a vow, if you said it
she'll marry you
if I said it she'll marry me
She'll marry me if I said it,
and will marry you if you said it
No! She'll marry you if I said it,
and marry me if you said it
She'll marry you if I said it,
and marry me if you said it
You have it all wrong. Like I said
She'll marry whoever said it
That's right
Said what?
It's not easy to be a doctor
You remember who said it?
Either you or I
Good memory
Of course
What are you doing?
Every doctor has a kind heart
it's the system that corrupted them
I'll remind them who they really are!
How?
Setting an example by doing everything
Will that include many
meaningless chores?
The more meaningless the better!
Go for it... Go for it
The manual
Not in Chinese?
Go for it... Go for it
Go for it... Go for it
3 hours left until the next shift,
let's get some rest
Get up!
Get up!
Get up! Time to work!
As usual, there's no one here
I have to go to the bathroom
You're always like this
Haven't eaten yet?
You think we can change them?
Someone plans to jump off of
the building!
How can this happen?
See? They responded!
I love you!
I found a job, I'm no longer a beggar
I don't date part-time construction
worker
It's a full-time job!
I don't like someone uneducated
Buddy, don't jump!
Wait!
What are you doing?
My car!
Life comes first!
Let me move my car first!
Don't jump!
Don't make me hit you, kid!
Let me move my car first!
I've nothing to do with this!
What's wrong with you?
You hit my car!
Calm down
Don't come closer!
Tell me your problem
Too late!
I came here for Appendectomy,
but had my sperm duct removed
Then a bad blood transfusion
destroyed my liver
During liver transplant bad oxygen
destroyed my lung
4 years later and my duodenum
is still not removed
instead my body is all messed up
My boss fired me, my wife left me
My existence is meaningless!
My death will bring attention
to this hospital's negligence
No, nobody will care
Look, they're busy getting their cars
out of the way
Give us a little time
We are trying to make changes
This place will turn into a caring
and responsible hospital
Really? Caring?
Pay up! You can't check-out
without paying
I'm about to jump!
That's the same as checking-out, pay up
I have no money
Stop making excuses
You hit my car, I want $30,000
for the damages
$30,000, are you kidding?
You switched lane without signaling
A guy jumped down, what can I do?
Whatever!
Pay for the damages!
Cross match, CBP, full-bodied X-ray!
Saline full rate, uncross match 4 units!
Get a drill, and diathermy
What color do you want?
What?
A & E doesn't have these supplies
you need to apply
Yellow is for one-month approval
Red is for one-week approval
Blue is for next-day approval
When do you need the supplies?
Right now!
Then it's the green one, but it ran out
You can submit a white form
to Administration
or a black one to the Highest
Management
Bring it back to the 2nd floor!
Sterilize them
Life comes first, hurry!
Damn! Can they revive him?
Hope God answers our prayer
Joe!
Joe!
Still no response
8:50, certify!
What's that thing attached to the liver?
The duodenum's got something too!
Isn't that Leon's mobile?
Does it still work?
Dentures? Someone didn't wear
his mask
He did
How is he, doctor?
Sorry, we did everything
Pay for your own car repair
Shit!
Come back to life!
I just paid off the mortgage on my car!
This belongs to the deceased
tell the doctors that operated on him
to pick up their things
Yes
Let's see what he's got. $41.5
Don't jump to death
if you had no money
Why couldn't you do it from a cliff?
You hit my car!
They're the same
because we haven't done enough
We've done a lot
Apparently not enough
Can't believe I just lost money like that
What? You have to pay for the repair!
And where's your apology?
Andy, sometimes one's luck
just hits the bottom
You
Sorry, doctors
Didn't mean to damage your cars
Sorry, doctors
Sorry, doctors
Didn't mean to damage your cars
More people are here, don't be afraid
Not afraid
We're sorry!
Find the doctor that did this to you
Let us go!
There's a ghost combing her hair
Then in an instant appeared over there!
Do I look pretty?
You girls never stop having fun.
Order take-out?
You guadvulets most not wonder
around the building
People would think your brother
came back from the dead!
You gave us a scare!
Thought we saw ghost!
It's safer to follow him
What are they doing?
Fixing our cars, I think
They are pretty decent people
Don't rush to judgement,
see if they can fix our cars first
They are admirable
we look insignificant in comparison
Andy, you can't make comparison
like that
There are halos above them
No way
It's just reflection, you're ignorant
That's true
If good people have halos
then should bad people have horns?
That's rubbish!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I don't like educated men,
I want someone rich
We've done enough
why haven't they changed?
You're right
Maybe they're not aware of
what we're doing
Should we make it more obvious?
1, 2
Up and down, up and down,
I am brushing my teeth around
You hear that? They're cleaning
the bathroom!
I'll be touched if they add new water
What did you say?
Doctor, I'm because of overworking
I'm not talking to you
Sell the stocks
What's your problem?
I haven't slept for days
Everything is out of focus
I can't hear things clearly
Then there's a blackout
Who turned off the light?
Then I passed out
Should we help them?
We don't want them dead here
We have no choice
Give a hand
We'll take care of you later, move!
This was a long day, I'm tired
I'm done for the night
I don't want to work to death
Looks serious
We have to find something to do
Yes, something
It's not my fault
They looked identical
& said they were going to the cemetery
Anyone would've got scared
and crashed his car
I'm really fine
You should treat them first
Your condition worries me more!
You may not feel any pain
But there's the possibility of concussion
and internal bleeding
Make way
What a pity, we've got a patient
Another one?
That one sitting over there
Are you okay?
Yes
No really, are you okay?
Wake Joe and the other two
up to help us out
Go get Joe
Lie down
How are you? Does it hurt?
No
What caused the accident?
I thought I saw ghost
Doctor! Doctor!
4 patients are brought to the hospital
They are the quadruplets
Wake up, doctor
Any problem with your hearing?
Give me your hands
Do you feel dizzy?
No
Skull X-ray, Cat Scan!
Any problem with your hearing?
You asked me that already
I'm testing your ability to recall things
What are you doing now?
The bandage is a mess. I'll do it over!
200!
Clear!
No one to clear
There's another one over there!
You can't just leave him there dying!
Their brother already killed
himself here
do you want them all to die here?
I'll help you, doctor
Defibrillator, clear!
Clear!
Certify!
10:15, certify
Certify!
I'm the patients' mother, doctor
Sorry! We've done everything
They all signed the organ donation card
Take any part you think is helpful
Take them to Surgery!
ICU, hurry!
ICU, hurry!
Give me five!
We did it!
Thank you, doctor
It's my duty
Thank you, doctor
Thanks, Thanks
He has heartbeat
but there is heart failure
He needs heart transplant now
or he won't make it!
Prepare heart transplant surgery
Yes
Thank you
Please help him
Please help him
What a pity! There's a complication!
ICU won't take him!
BP 100/50, pulse 100!
His face is pale!
No urine!
Abdominal distension!
Edema of extremities!
Possible kidneys and liver failure!
Heart arrest, Doctor!
Go to the OR!
Don't just stand around, hurry up!
Should we have transplant organs
standing by?
Get as many as you can
It's really not easy to be a doctor!
BP 60/30, pulse 100, SAO272
We have to hurry
Organs of the deceased
don't last more than 30 minutes
You can't take back the bodies
The patient is their youngest brother!
But the bodies are already sent to
other departments
What can we do?
Which form should we fill out?
Only way is to snatch them!
Liver and kidneys need to be removed
How much time left?
15 minutes
Help!
Suction
Stay focused
It's not easy to be a doctor!
What's the condition?
The heart, liver and kidneys need
transplant
Bad lung, heart, and kidneys
Bad heart, liver and lungs
Bad liver, kidneys and lung
Do we have healthy heart, liver
and lung?
I've got a liver!
I've got kidneys!
I've got a heart!
Prepare transplant!
The operation was a success!
I'll go visit him
Thank you, doctor
Thank you, doctor
Thank you, doctor
Thank you
It's really not that easy to be a doctor!
It's really not that easy to be a nurse!
I won the lottery with the highest
prize money in the history!
I love you!
Sorry
Money doesn't impress me anymore
I like someone good-looking
Money doesn't impress you?
Money doesn't impress you?
Speak!
No!
Misappropriating organs is
a criminal offense
Write!
No response
He's pissed!
Use Joe as scapegoat
How about someone else?
He has nothing to do with this
Guaranteed promotion and raise!
3 minutes
Give me 3 minutes
I never commit to anything
for more than 3 minutes
This time I won't betray my friend
Let's see if I'll change my mind!
Still couldn't get a sound out of them
They're persistent
What are you doing?
Leaving this place
You're leaving too?
You didn't hit anyone
or steal dead bodies
My contract just expired
Sir Ho asked me to work for 3 months
It's been that long already
And all these time the 7 Rats try
so hard to make you leave
They've always been that clueless
And all this time we fought for you
Then we are stupid too?
You guys are pretty clueless as well!
What are you doing?
Leaving with you guys!
You're giving up your job here?
Right!
Do you know how to drive a taxi?
No
Want to work at 7-11?
No. How about the bar?
You wear sexy nurse uniform
to entertain men
No
Anything else you can do?
Don't go, go on being a doctor!
Yes
Take care!
Good-bye!
Doctor
Who are you?
I love you!
What did you do to yourself?
I spent all my money on plastic surgery
Am I good-looking?
Sorry, but I have a crush on a doctor
Please don't do anything more for me
Thank you
You're really good-looking
How is my car?
I'm sorry, we've done everything
This auto shop is reliable
I hope you can donate the parts
I listed here to it

At 9:20 this evening lightning
struck the power plant at the Peak
It knocked out all electricity

Most of the accidents took place

A public bus and a tourist bus
overturned and crashed
There is a large number of
injured passengers
The accident happened
near Ho Kau Kei hospital
Pacing back and forth,
can't make up your mind
Don't hesitate, go!
You've been low-spirited
ever since you came back
Your heart is at another place
Come out!
Everyone out!
Your enjoy talking to me from
underneath the cars?
Where else should car mechanics be?
The chassis needs repair
What's with the erect wipers and
the flashing signal lights?
Stop hesitating. Go!
There are lives to save!
Thanks!
How did the door open with power?
Benz is sick
Didn't come to work today
You are late
What are you doing?
Friendship is one thing,
money is another
What are you doing now?
If I'm paying, might as well make
myself comfortable
Drive!
You can't come through!
I'm a doctor
What?
I'm a doctor!
Me too!
You don't look like a doctor
You don't look like a cop
Good point
Go ahead
Don't give me a ticket
You can't come through!
We are nurse
You don't like nurse
We don't look like nurse?
What makes us nurse?
I take it back, go ahead
You don't have to
Thanks!
Throat is swollen
CAT 1! No breathing, no pulse!

Trachea tube!
Doctor!
Hold on!
Trachea tube!

Just finished medical school?
Barely one month
How can they send a new guy here?
I'm the most experienced doctor
in the hospital
Give him oxygen
Jim!
Give him oxygen
Doctor!
You all came
What a pity! Someone could die!
Don't just stand here

$170 including tolls for the tunnel
You took the long route!
BB1234, my name is Leon Lai,
go sue me!
$170!

I didn't charge you for the luggage
You call these luggage?
You
We're doctors!
These two look more like it!
Your name?
Lam Wai Keung
Doctor, you have a fishy smell
Don't worry, I'll be careful
No, you have a fishy smell
Of course it'll hurt a bit
You crashed a car, not a bicycle!
No, doctor
You have a fishy smell
Do you know where you are?
How do you feel?
I know I'm at a fish market
and you smell really bad
He's unconscious. CAT 1
Where are they?
Over there!
This way?
Told you was over there!
Buddy, your name and your status?
Are you OK?
I'm a gangster, nothing major
Just have a problem with you
How dare you to show up at my turf?
I'll kick your ass!
Speaking incoherently, very critical
CAT 1!
What's your name? How do you feel?
Know where you are?
I'm Leung Kar Shing, this is the scene
of the accident
Couldn't stop my car, my head hit
the steering wheel
the cut on my left eye hasn't
stopped bleeding
there are bruises on my right cheek
broke my nose ridge, there's blood
coming out
had a few cough this morning
and had constipation
He's conscious, but in critical condition
CAT 1
CAT 1? But I could recall everything
Take a look yourself!
How did I miss that?
I'm finally here!
That is serious!
A retribution!
We're making up for all the years of
slacking off
Doctor
Why haven't you asked my name?
Where I am, and my condition?
Do you know your condition?
No, what happened?
Major hemorrhage, have to get you
to the hospital
Your feet are trapped under
the steering wheel
I had to use a saw
Left foot or right foot?
Half of left foot, the entire right foot
What's wrong with you?
What's your name?
6, 7, 8...
I'll hold it for you, Doc
What's my count?
6, 7
6, 7, 8, 9
6
Life comes first!
11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Trying to steal my money?
Want a coke?
Chocolate?
Chewing gum?
Wrigley's?
You got Sprite?
$10
A pack of cigarette
Buddy, how can you smoke?
Leave me alone!
$50
What a pity! Doctor!
Our hospital's shuttle bus
is here too!
Yan's name is on the list
What?
Have you seen Yan?
No
Yan!
Over here
Yan!
Yan!
What a pity!
Go get the fire service!
Someone could die!
What's your name? What's your
Are you all right?
I'm okay, just taking a nap
How did this happen?
You won't believe it
When the car over turned
the bamboo sticks flew around me
I kept ducking
and this is how it turned out
I'll get you out!
Be careful with that!
This is extremely complicated
The bamboo sticks are piled up on
each other
You can't tell how one will affect
the other
and which one may put a hole
in my body
This is trouble
Hurry, someone could die!
Where?
Stop asking questions!
What a pity! The firemen are busy!
Don't worry... They're here to help
Let me!
Don't!
It hurts
Be careful with the bamboo sticks!
You should've told us! Sorry
I'm okay, let me be
Fireman said I'll be fine
if there's no landslide
You blind? Wipe your glasses!
Look!
Let's go! It's a landslide!
We should go
Where's your compassion?
You're despicable!
I'm not that despicable?
But how can we escape?
Give me your hands!
What?
What now?
I got an idea
Leon, here!
Hold on to this, this one!
When I say 1, pull
When I say 2, push forward
You'll use the saw, and I'll cut the sticks
Leon
Give me your hand
Why?
When I say 1, grab this and turn left
Leon will use the saw,
and you'll follow him
Move
No!
She could get hurt!
There's no time for that
No time?
What if you cut her stomach,
or scratches her face?
We'll worry about that later, let's go!
I have a plan, it'll work
It's too difficult, there's no time
Difficulty is not the issue,
what matters is the patient's future!
It's not easy to be a doctor!
It was him!
So it was you!
So it was me
We'll go with your plan
Everyone remember the steps?
Yes
That's good
One more thing, Joe
You've got the difficult job
On 1, pull 1/2 foot
On 2, push back 3 inches
On 3, move left 1/2 inch
Then pull her out
How about you?
I'll do the countdown
I'll lift it up!
That's right
I'll lift it up!
1!
2!
3!
Let's go!
How come it's not you?
Sorry, I wish it was me too
Don't play games here. Remember,
you made a vow
Life is a funny thing
Before love blossoms, it's already
withered
The thought of calling you sister-in-law
is unbearable
You adulterous couple!
But it's okay, from now on
You'll take her body, I'll keep her soul
Serena, you're doing it wrong
Told you he needs intensive care
Rub it on his nose ridge and philtrum
Wake up! Wake up!
Use more
He needs intensive care!
This guy has internal injury
One dosage of diarrhea pills
He has bone fractures,
100 cc of arthritis oil
What are you doing here?
Saving people! It's wearing me out
I thought there are two new doctors
One passed out. The other freaked out
his mom took him home
We'll take it from here
Everyone stays alert
Nobody knows what will happen next
Such as?
Everybody, because of the disaster
tonight
We've decided to help out,
the bathroom is in service now
You can use all of the urinals,
we'll clean them all
Really anything can happen!
Turn the lights down, don't waste
A & E is waiting for instructions
As if I know anything
What if they ask again?
We better sneak away
We are the highest management!
Let us out! Help!
You rats finally decided to speak?
See what I'll do to you!
You're dead!
Doctor, you have a smile on your face
Does it mean I'm all right?
No, I'm getting married!
My wife is over there. Isn't she pretty?
Yes, congratulations
So am I all right?
No, start preparing your funeral
You don't have to take your vow
that seriously
Doctor, how's my husband?
Will he live?
Doesn't matter, this is what life is about
The guy you marry is never
the one you're in love with
What's a good honeymoon destination?
Austria or Australia?
She seems to like Joe more
I know
Where should I throw the wedding bash?
Never knew losing love hurt this much!
Feels like your heart is crushed?
No, my heart is beating very fast,
and I'm sweating
My stomach feels very full
Also, it hurts here
It could be liver rupture,
internal bleeding
Yeah
Really anything can happen!
The back-up generator may go
any second... I'm just kidding!
BP 100/60, pulse 90
Losing blood fast! I can't find the wound!
Fingers are turning blue!
4 units of unmatched blood, quick!
Heart arrest! Defibrillator!
Ampoules!
Clear!
Again!
Clear!
No power!
Back-up battery is dead
I can't clog the blood
without diathermy
4 minutes left before brain stem failure
What a pity, lots of lives will be lost
How can you resuscitate him
without electricity?
How do you stop the bleeding?
Not so fast!
Kids, just calm down
Lightning will revive him!
How much time left?
Less than 2 minutes!
Why is it taking so long?
You're staying here?
Here's how to attract lightning
Twice I was hit while doing
my sword exercise
Lightning will strike
if you do this move
Trying to strike me again?
I may die the third time
I should dodge this one
1 minute and 15 seconds left!
Hurry up!
Strike him!
Strike!
Strike him!
Strike!
Wait, wait!
Lightning carries a lot of wattage
it's too powerful for Joe's good
Use a resistor!
It can reduce the electrical charge to
the same level as the Defibrillator
250 watts, that'll be perfect
Where can you find a resistor?
Anything with a resistance of
400 Kilo Ohm will do
Look around!
No, no
What a pity! Nothing is right.
Someone could die!
30 seconds left!
We'll use human body!
Human being's resistance level
should be enough
That's dangerous
The person could
...COULD DIE!
Yan!
10 seconds left!
You bastard! Strike him!
What a pity! The rain stopped!
Sir Ho, the storm is not responding
tonight!
I'm ninety-something and
you won't help me,
where's your compassion?
I better shut up!
Please, please help my husband!
So all along I was the third person!
Clear!
Joe
Will you marry me?
What about Jim?
You can forget me
I've always been a wanderer
I'm a like a bird without a nest
A bird? More like a chicken!
Thank you
Damn it!
Ridiculous! No hospital is like that!
Do some research before you shoot!
Turn it back on, doctor!
You here to see me or the TV?
You
What's wrong?
I was hit by a cart,
it could be liver rupture
Does it hurt?
No
Then I'll come back to you later
When I did mouth-to-mouth to a fish,
I swallowed it accidentally
It's still alive in my stomach
Do you eat sushi?
Yes
You can go now
I have to get it out of my system
How can you not see
the convenient store?
You know how to drive a taxi?
Sorry, athlete's foot
Pay for the damage!
Yeah right!
Pay for the damage!
Yeah right!
Why sell your body dressed up
like nurse?
It's an insult to the medical profession
What? We're bartenders
Bartenders?
Your skirts are so short
I did many good deeds!
I donated money to the hospital!
Don't go!
Doctor, can you cut 1 inch lower
when performing Appendectomy?
No!
But I want to wear bikinis,
and marry a good family
Forget it!
But what matters is the patient's future
It's not easy to be a doctor!
Take him to the Psychiatric
