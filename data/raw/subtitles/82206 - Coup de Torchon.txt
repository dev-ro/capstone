<b>COUP DE TORCHON</b>
<b>FRENCH WEST AFRICA
July 1938</b>
<b>I thought it was judgment day!</b>
<b>Get out of bed, lug.
Vanderbruck's coming.</b>
<b>I feel I didn't get
my night's worth.</b>
<b>- Just what do you want?
- They say a husband's got certain... rights.</b>
<b>Worry about Vanderbruck.</b>
<b>Mr. Vanderbruck!
Always first, eh?</b>
<b>The roof still needs fixing.
Go fetch the carpenter.</b>
<b>But it's not the police's job.</b>
<b>These privies belong
to the Forestry Co.</b>
<b>They're your private property,
in a manner of speaking.</b>
<b>The whole town enjoys them.</b>
<b>The whole town, except me.</b>
<b>It's the first thing
that greets me every morning.</b>
<b>- Can't you move them?
- I can't.</b>
<b>- Why not?
- Because they're there.</b>
<b>Well, that's a fact.</b>
<b>No... not here.</b>
<b>- Not there either...
- Not here nor there.</b>
<b>Well, where then?</b>
<b>Nowhere.</b>
You think you and me are gonna...
<b>After what you've just done?</b>
<b>What have I done?</b>
<b>You said: Vanderbruck's a
public menace.</b>
<b>His latrines are a health hazard,</b>
<b>the law should take action and
since I'm the law, those rotten shit holes</b>
<b>will be gone in a week.
- That's what I said.</b>
<b>Sure...</b>
You chickened out.
<b>He pissed all over you!</b>
<b>Listen, to ass lickers like you</b>
<b>I will serve the soup,
but don't expect...</b>
<b>I'm not sure I agree with you.</b>
Maybe you're right,
but maybe you're wrong.
<b>Anyway, even if I'm what you say,
I'm not the only one. So there!</b>
Mama!
Your kid brother's up.
<b>I'm coming, Nono dear.</b>
<b>Funny, him calling
his sister Mama.</b>
<b>- What's my Nono want?
- There's a beast under my bed!</b>
<b>That's no reason to call me Mama.</b>
<b>And it doesn't flatter you,
sweetness,</b>
<b>being called Nono's mother:</b>
<b>Gives folks a wrong
idea of your age.</b>
<b>Whatta ya know... no more duck.</b>
<b>He had a bad scare.
The poor thing.</b>
<b>I noticed.</b>
You know what the beast was?
Yeah, a poisonous moth.
<b>Hey, that's my shirt he's got on,
and it's in shreds.</b>
<b>In shreds?</b>
<b>And his eye's scratched too.
Must have been that poisonous moth, huh?</b>
<b>- Don't kill me, Lucien.
- Kill you?</b>
<b>I'm speaking French, no? 'Kill me',
Understand that?</b>
<b>What's he trying to say?</b>
<b>It's about your job, putting folks
in the cooler, you know.</b>
<b>If it wasn't you,
I'd bet my right arm</b>
<b>some lady ripped my shirt, no?</b>
<b>There you go killing me.</b>
<b>That looks great.</b>
<b>It could use some rum.</b>
<b>Rum! Rum! Quick!</b>
<b>Bottle of rum.
Rice pudding wants rum, always!</b>
<b>Aren't you late for work?</b>
<b>I'm looking for my hat.</b>
<b>It's on your head, jerk!</b>
Mama, come and try
the pudding with rum.
<b>It's yummy, but don't say Mama.</b>
<b>- We'll have some.
- I hope so.</b>
<b>Is it true you had a girl last night?</b>
<b>- There's salt in the coffee!
- Cut the crap!</b>
<b>I tell you there's salt
in the coffee!</b>
<b>What a surprise.
I'm glad to see you.</b>
<b>Well, we're not. Being
with trash like you looks bad.</b>
<b>The brothel's feasting
the new colonel...</b>
<b>Got any prisoners
who can wait tables?</b>
<b>You know I never arrest anyone
unless I have to.</b>
<b>I have enough troubles
of my own.</b>
<b>What good is an empty prison?</b>
<b>- He's dumber than we thought.
- That's true.</b>
<b>Morning, Mr Cordier.
Coffee's ready.</b>
<b>And that's not a prisoner?</b>
<b>That one's mine!</b>
- You didn't mention him.
- Because he's mine.
<b>We'll borrow him 'til tomorrow, old chap.</b>
<b>- But he's old and stone deaf.
- Can he make coffee?</b>
<b>He poisoned his wife.</b>
But can he make coffee?
<b>Not very well, no.</b>
<b>It's not bad at all.</b>
<b>Superb! Bring him over tomorrow.</b>
<b>- What's your name?
- Fête-Nat.</b>
<b>So you were born
on Bastille Day, like me.</b>
<b>You've got a good life here in
Bourkassa. Better than in France.</b>
<b>You may be right there.
I can't complain.</b>
<b>I've got free housing,
the wireless, bath, electricity.</b>
<b>At times, not always, I think
I've found paradise on earth.</b>
<b>But you're still a zero!</b>
<b>- Shit, he fell.
- He went plop!</b>
<b>That's not very nice.</b>
<b>It was an accident.</b>
You didn't break anything.
<b>We were kidding.</b>
Yeah, just kidding.
<b>Then that's different.</b>
<b>Ooh, he slipped.</b>
<b>Say, "Fête-Nat" isn't
a saint's name, is it?</b>
<b>No, it's the 14th of July!</b>
<b>- I don't get it.
- You're a jerk too.</b>
<b>- But it's true.
- "National holiday"!</b>
<b>Oh, "Fête-Nationale"!</b>
<b>Your hand's shaking, Fête-Nat.</b>
<b>We're both shaking.</b>
<b>Y'know, I couldn't sleep
last night.</b>
<b>I lay in bed, eyes wide open,
tossing and turning</b>
<b>'til I thought I'd go crazy.</b>
<b>Then, suddenly, I got fed up
and said to myself:</b>
"You're going to go bananas."
<b>So I thought and thought...</b>
<b>'til my head ached
from thinking so hard...</b>
<b>and I came to the conclusion</b>
<b>that I just didn't know
what the fuck to do.</b>
You forgot my birthday!
Let me go.
You're hurting me!
Let me go!
<b>- You don't love me.
- No, I don't love you.</b>
<b>- Hear that?
- I don't hear a thing.</b>
<b>It's that brute Marcaillou,
beating his wife again.</b>
<b>Some day he'll kill her.</b>
<b>I must have water in my ears.</b>
<b>Now I can hear.</b>
<b>He's giving the poor kid
a bad time.</b>
<b>- You won't stop him?
- Sure, I'm going.</b>
<b>How much?</b>
<b>- Can't find it.
- Next time.</b>
<b>I hate debts. Here.</b>
<b>- Thank you. Seems to be over.
- Yes, it would seem so.</b>
<b>Rosette. Where'd the dirty pig go?
He's split, uhm?</b>
<b>That way.</b>
<b>I'm too late.
I came running when I heard.</b>
Look, he broke my bag, the pig.
<b>What a filthy mess.</b>
<b>There, there, my Rosette,
my Rosalie.</b>
<b>Put your hand
between my legs...</b>
<b>In the street?</b>
<b>At least they know someone loves me.</b>
<b>It's all over now,
my Rosette.</b>
<b>He hurt me.</b>
<b>It's all over now.
Think about me.</b>
Get down!
<b>Missed! It's your fault.</b>
<b>What are you hunting?</b>
<b>Nothing, jerk.
We're shooting stiffs.</b>
<b>Doesn't bother them and
it's fun for us.</b>
<b>When dysentery's cured,
we'll find a new sport.</b>
<b>This one's yours, Le Péron.</b>
<b>Look, I blew his head off.</b>
<b>You may not be aware of it,
but you're breaking the law</b>
and mocking the dead.
<b>But they're niggers,
thrown in like dead dogs.</b>
<b>No, they've been entrusted
to the river.</b>
<b>It's a ceremony, sort of a burial...
...words can't explain...</b>
You're desecrating their graves.
<b>So how much would the fine be for... that?</b>
<b>I'd like to know the value
of a stiff</b>
who used to earn a franc a day.
<b>Let's say a hundred,
but I'll close my eyes for fifty.</b>
<b>Fifty? What do you say?</b>
<b>OK, but on one condition...</b>
<b>- You can take a shot.
- I can't in my position.</b>
<b>- Just one round.
- No!</b>
<b>That body's blocked by a log.</b>
You miss on purpose?
<b>At least he tried.</b>
<b>You can always be bribed.</b>
<b>I've got no choice.
First, I'm underpaid...</b>
<b>second, my wife takes
all my money...</b>
<b>and third, fining you
is practically a civic duty.</b>
<b>No, Le Péron.</b>
Where'd you learn to play pool?
<b>How's your stick in bed?</b>
<b>Lucien! What's new?
I hope you can cheer us up.</b>
<b>Paulo, this is Lucien Cordier,
Police Chief of Bourkassa...</b>
<b>and this gawk is Paulo
who just arrived in this hole.</b>
<b>A drink?</b>
<b>Things booming?</b>
Booming, maybe... but...
<b>Bourkassa's not a big city
like here.</b>
<b>- How big is it?
- There's a signpost marked Pop. 1275.</b>
<b>Pop?</b>
<b>That means 1275 souls.</b>
<b>And as many people as souls?</b>
<b>Obviously.</b>
<b>I think you're wrong
to say 1275 souls...</b>
<b>It means 1275 inhabitants,
right, Paulo?</b>
<b>You bet, Marcel.</b>
<b>Tell him why, bright eye.</b>
You're more convincing.
<b>Your 1275 souls, that includes
niggers. But they've got no soul.</b>
<b>- Right?
- You bet.</b>
Maybe you're right,
but maybe you're wrong.
<b>How come blacks have got no soul?</b>
<b>Make him see the light.</b>
<b>They don't have soul 'cause
they're not really people.</b>
<b>Well, what are they then?</b>
<b>Just niggers, that's all.</b>
<b>The proof is we call them
niggers, not people.</b>
<b>Now wait a sec. How about this?</b>
<b>A white baby loses his mama,
who's also white...</b>
<b>It happens?
- It happens.</b>
<b>And there's nobody to feed him
but a black woman. She saves him, right?</b>
<b>- Yeah, so?
- Well, that proves</b>
<b>...Nothing
He could suckle a cow,</b>
<b>does that prove that cows are people?</b>
<b>I've slept with black women,
never with cows.</b>
<b>You could've.</b>
<b>But that doesn't prove
that cows are people.</b>
<b>Put that in your pipe!</b>
<b>You're great at logic, Marcel!</b>
<b>But you didn't come here
for my logic.</b>
<b>Oh, no! I've got headaches.</b>
<b>My head's all twisted.</b>
<b>I've lost my appetite.</b>
<b>So I thought and thought...</b>
<b>and I came to the conclusion</b>
<b>that I didn't know what to do.</b>
Go on!
<b>Out of the way, hag!</b>
<b>What? Shoes!</b>
<b>Did you hear? Those two pimps
are giving him hell.</b>
<b>And always in public.
It's bad for my reputation.</b>
But you don't stand for it.
<b>No, I give it right back.</b>
<b>I don't muzzle 'em,
but I bait 'em good.</b>
<b>He baits 'em.
You ever hear that before?</b>
<b>First time in my fuckin' life.</b>
You did good to come and see me.
<b>I'm gonna tell you -
no, show you - what to do.</b>
<b>Turn around.</b>
<b>I'm gonna illustrate my lesson.</b>
<b>Come back! Come back!</b>
<b>Sit down.
I wanna ask you something.</b>
<b>- I'd rather stand.
- OK.</b>
<b>If a guy kicks you in the ass,
what do you do?</b>
<b>I kick him back -
that way, we're even.</b>
<b>Turn around again.
You didn't follow.</b>
<b>- Just tell me.
- Who's in charge?</b>
<b>Turn around.</b>
<b>Did you understand this time?</b>
You gotta give it back
twice as bad.
But the pimps never kicked my ass.
<b>It's the principle.
Right, Paulo?</b>
<b>You bet. If a guy bugs you,
you bug him twice as bad.</b>
<b>Otherwise, it becomes a
status quo.</b>
<b>Next time your two pimps
start up...</b>
<b>kick 'em as hard as you can
in the balls.</b>
<b>But that'll hurt a lot!</b>
You gotta have good shoes...
<b>with no holes in the toes.</b>
<b>If it were up to me,
I'd rub 'em out. Pronto.</b>
<b>One, two... in the teeth!</b>
<b>I wouldn't miss the opportunity.</b>
<b>Damn straight!
Out of my sight!</b>
<b>Tell Marcel he's put me at ease.</b>
<b>Let us help you, Miss.</b>
<b>Now that he's told me
what to do...</b>
<b>thanks to him, I'm covered.</b>
<b>- Covered? How's that?
- Sure.</b>
<b>Cordier, what do you mean?</b>
<b>- Tell him, he'll understand.
- Cordier...</b>
<b>Bye... glad to have met you.</b>
<b>- May I show you how to peel it?
- That would be great.</b>
<b>So, wandering all alone
about Africa for fun?</b>
<b>Fun? I don't know yet. I'm the
new schoolteacher of Bourkassa.</b>
<b>That's a fine profession,
a vocation, I'd say.</b>
<b>Thanks to you,
black children will be able</b>
<b>to read their daddy's name
on French war memorials.</b>
<b>Did I offend you?</b>
<b>Not really.</b>
<b>Around here you've got
to joke a little</b>
<b>or you'll wind up
shooting yourself.</b>
<b>Is it good?</b>
<b>Delicious.</b>
<b>The exact time, please.</b>
<b>Six P.M.</b>
<b>Six P.M. We're entering
the virgin forest.</b>
<b>Six P.M. We're entering
the virgin forest.</b>
<b>Do you always carry a gun?</b>
<b>I have to, I'm the police
chief of Bourkassa.</b>
<b>- It frightens you?
- No.</b>
<b>I've never used it.</b>
<b>Careful, they're heavy.</b>
<b>Books... maybe I brought too many.</b>
<b>There's so much time to read,
you end up not reading at all.</b>
<b>Here's your school,
and your house across the street.</b>
<b>I'll lend it to you.</b>
<b>And I'll take it.
That way I'll see you again.</b>
<b>It's by an aviator.</b>
<b>In that case...
Let me help you.</b>
You've got no business around here.
<b>Doing nothing is my job.
I'm paid for it.</b>
<b>So go piss about somewhere else.</b>
You're going a bit far!
<b>What's with you?</b>
<b>Hands up.</b>
<b>Well, if it pleases you.</b>
<b>What would please me, is for you
to sing me a song.</b>
You must be kidding.
<b>"Caterinetta Bella" for instance.
You like that one?</b>
<b>Sure we like it.</b>
But that's no reason
to take your gun out.
Go on.
<b>When a gun is pointed at me,
I sing out of key.</b>
<b>I'll count to three.</b>
<b>One...</b>
<b>Two...</b>
You're just 16
and you should see...
How you trouble all the men...
<b>I would have expected better.</b>
<b>You're spoiling my fun.</b>
<b>When does the joke end?</b>
<b>We can do better.</b>
Is it your eyes so soft
that flips their wig...
Or your tits so big
that makes them daft...
Oh, bella Caterinetta...
<b>Listen, love
is calling you...</b>
Why say no, not now...
Get up, Lucien.
What is it?
Go answer the door.
<b>Get a move on.
They'll wake Nono.</b>
<b>- And if it's a thief?
- You're the law, moron!</b>
<b>True...</b>
<b>He's playing dumb.
Put your pants on.</b>
By the way, dear,
did you by chance find
<b>some bank notes that might've
slipped out of my pocket?</b>
Look... with this war
brewing out there...
You can't reproach me
for buying provisions.
<b>Don't get annoyed, my sweet.</b>
<b>I'm not annoyed.</b>
<b>Did you or did you not do it?</b>
<b>Me? What have I done?</b>
<b>Answer me, for chrissake!</b>
<b>You're acting like
I killed someone.</b>
<b>Then you didn't do it?</b>
<b>What? Kill someone?
What an idea!</b>
You scared me.
<b>One shot kills thirst;
two, worms; three, death.</b>
<b>Paulo scared the shit outta me.</b>
<b>He said your killing those pimps
would put me in a bind.</b>
<b>You couldn't even hurt a fly.</b>
<b>But you believed it.</b>
<b>I thought "Stupid as he is,
he might take me seriously."</b>
You've never misguided me.
<b>You might have thought it a good idea
when it was simply a joke.</b>
<b>I can tell the difference.</b>
<b>I came out here to save you.
Can I bunk here?</b>
<b>I hate to say no,
but there's no room.</b>
<b>Is the hotel far?</b>
<b>It's closed on account
of the epidemic.</b>
<b>So, where?</b>
<b>Well, you could...</b>
<b>No, you wouldn't sleep.</b>
Just try me.
<b>Not at a brothel...</b>
<b>Especially with girls
of top grade...</b>
<b>French, little girls.</b>
<b>What's little for you?</b>
<b>One of them is not 14 yet.</b>
<b>- Christ... and the law?
- No complaints, yet...</b>
<b>and in a country where black girls fuck at 12</b>
<b>- Yeah, white girls can't be left out.
- You bet.</b>
<b>Is it far?</b>
<b>- Well, there are those damn pimps
- You leave 'em to me.</b>
<b>They're probably off
getting smashed.</b>
<b>- You sure?
- Yeah, they'll be out all night.</b>
<b>But they still scare the girls.</b>
You might not get in.
<b>I beg your pardon there. Old Marcel
Chevasson wasn't born yesterday.</b>
<b>I'll tell 'em I've seen
to their two shits...</b>
<b>and that they won't
hurt a fly now.</b>
<b>You're just too much, Marcel...
I couldn't have done better myself.</b>
All alone in my empty room...
In my mouth,
a taste of gloom...
In my heart I hear
awful cries...
And there's darkness all around me
The door just closed...
Behind him now
he's shut away...
Our kisses and love vows...
<b>Try this.</b>
<b>A "tricolore".
Coffee, cognac, rum and calvados.</b>
<b>You must have given those ladies
quite a memory.</b>
<b>I did my best.</b>
<b>It's not every day they get
a real man in their bed.</b>
<b>And it didn't cost a cent.</b>
<b>Weren't they worried about the pimps?</b>
<b>They bought my yarn.</b>
<b>Tell me again what you said, Marcel.</b>
<b>"I put your pimps
in their place..."</b>
"You won't see 'em around too soon."
<b>That's it to the letter...</b>
<b>They'll stay away after your lesson,
right Marcel?</b>
<b>What did he do?</b>
<b>He won't say it out of modesty.</b>
<b>But he's told it 20 times over.</b>
<b>I just can't get enough.</b>
<b>And get it
through your head, Fred,</b>
<b>there's only one way
to deal with scum like that.</b>
Yeah, but you've got
more guts than me.
<b>Going to the whorehouse
all by yourself.</b>
<b>I've only got myself, dimwit!</b>
<b>That's true.</b>
<b>Speaking of pimps...
Isn't your brother-in-law...</b>
<b>A pimp? Nono?
He's too stupid even for that.</b>
<b>No woman'd look at him,
except Huguette.</b>
<b>Of course, she's his sister.</b>
<b>I don't see a resemblance.</b>
You'd never guess
they're brother and sis.
<b>That did surprise me at first.</b>
You may be in for another
surprise some day, poor Lucien!
<b>Another round on Cordier!</b>
<b>As Foch says:
When you're a lion...</b>
<b>you can't be a clam.</b>
<b>I've had worse than your pimps.</b>
<b>And where do you think
they are now?</b>
<b>In jail?</b>
<b>Some day you'll learn a coffin
costs the state less</b>
<b>than a man in a cell, old chum.</b>
<b>Say, Bartali beat Verwaeck
at Briançon by 17 minutes.</b>
<b>Natch. He pledged his bike
to the Virgin Mary.</b>
<b>Bartali?</b>
<b>If you need a hand with
your pimps, call me.</b>
<b>...if they come back.
- Why shouldn't they?</b>
<b>- Could be dead.
- Why dead?</b>
<b>Could've been killed.
And you're a suspect.</b>
<b>- You crazy?
- Why, you advertised it.</b>
<b>I never said I killed them.
I said I gave 'em a lesson.</b>
<b>A black eye is a lesson.</b>
<b>A bullet in the head's a lesson too.</b>
<b>I've never even seen 'em.</b>
<b>Of course, they couldn't be there.</b>
<b>You're not telling me
you've killed them?</b>
<b>Look at me!
How can you think that?</b>
<b>But you,
after all your bragging around...</b>
<b>If the bodies
ever popped up</b>
<b>I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes.</b>
<b>You heard right, Marcel.</b>
<b>All you can do now is pray...</b>
<b>Pray that if they were really killed,
they'll never find the bodies.</b>
<b>You speak and folks believe you.
That's some gift!</b>
<b>Put that in your pipe!</b>
<b>- How many today?
- Five.</b>
<b>- Dysentery?
- Obviously.</b>
<b>- All blacks?
- No, one white.</b>
<b>Oh yes, one white. That's life.</b>
<b>Are you dumping him in the river?</b>
<b>Are you crazy? It's the
graveyard for the white one!</b>
<b>Does it hurt?</b>
<b>Look at me.
Am I hurting you?</b>
<b>She's got something in her eye.</b>
<b>Open your eye...</b>
Much work?
<b>Dirty work.</b>
<b>Sometimes, I just want to drop
everything. But I can't...</b>
<b>I never will.</b>
<b>That'll do it.</b>
<b>There, all better now.
Give us a kiss.</b>
<b>And me?</b>
<b>What are you waiting for?
Do your job.</b>
<b>Stop it! Marcaillou!
Goddammit!</b>
<b>- He won't sell me peanuts.
- He won't pay what's fair.</b>
<b>- So what?
- Now you've knocked him out.</b>
<b>You gonna arrest me
for clubbin' a nigger?</b>
<b>No, not exactly...</b>
<b>The main thing is the board.</b>
<b>- The board?
- Yeah, covering that hole there...</b>
<b>What if somebody fell in and broke
his leg? It'd be your fault.</b>
<b>- So?
- So, being as nobody did,</b>
<b>I'll let you off this time.</b>
You never arrest anybody.
<b>You've got to show folks
you're brave, honest,</b>
<b>and hard-working.
Here, hold this.</b>
<b>I can't.</b>
<b>Why not?</b>
<b>First, because I'm not brave,
honest and hard-working.</b>
<b>And second, I don't think
my chiefs want me to be.</b>
<b>What are you talking about?</b>
<b>Well, they wouldn't have
picked me otherwise.</b>
<b>- That's how I see it.
- Sophism.</b>
<b>And no reason to let
Marcaillou get away.</b>
<b>The trouble is he's Rose's husband.</b>
<b>We're good friends, Rose and me,
that's all.</b>
<b>But if I arrest him,
folks'll jump to conclusions.</b>
<b>Let them. Do your duty.</b>
<b>Get rid of the trash
that poisons us all!</b>
<b>And who's gonna get rid of
the shit that poisons my house?</b>
<b>All in good time, each thing
in turn and one after the other.</b>
<b>For the general good,
Marcaillou first.</b>
<b>Then we'll get to your
particular problem.</b>
<b>If you say so.</b>
<b>May God grant you
the courage you lack.</b>
<b>That trash, they won't
get me like that.</b>
<b>There, boy, go and get it!</b>
<b>What brings you around here,
you turd?</b>
<b>Hands off my gun.
- You won't need it anymore.</b>
<b>- I've got a hunting license.
- You won't need that neither.</b>
<b>I'm hanging around here to see your wife.</b>
And she's gonna give me
what you never got.
<b>Don't move!</b>
<b>Africans hate a boring death...</b>
<b>...in a hospital say, with doctors,
nurses and priests...</b>
You, you won't have a boring death.
<b>I know kicking a dying man
isn't very nice.</b>
<b>But first, I wanted to
and second, there's no risk involved.</b>
You know,
this hurts me more than you.
<b>No luck, damn it.
His dog has just come back.</b>
<b>- We've got a minute, right?
- You know I want you.</b>
<b>I'm not so sure... if you really
wanted to... it's a minute...</b>
<b>- You know very well it wouldn't.
- I'd love to take you in my lap.</b>
<b>- Stop it please, don't say such things...
- I'd love to lift your dress,</b>
<b>and you could just take it off
and let me see the nice things it hides.</b>
<b>You could slide it over
your shoulders, then...</b>
<b>Oh, hell, let's go.</b>
<b>Why are you taking the dress off?
Just sit in my lap. I must tell you...</b>
<b>Tell me later... quick, come here my love.</b>
<b>I have a feeling I'd better
tell you beforehand.</b>
<b>Come here now. I want you.</b>
<b>It's about Marcaillou.
Something's happened to him.</b>
<b>Who cares! Pity he hasn't
dropped dead yet.</b>
<b>That's exactly it. I have a feeling
his insides got blown up.</b>
<b>- Really?
- He tripped over his gun.</b>
<b>Is he really dead?</b>
<b>If he isn't, he's the first guy
to get kicked in the balls and not budge.</b>
<b>Shit, I can't believe it! Pity
I didn't see the pig croak.</b>
<b>I'd have enjoyed ramming
a poker up his ass.</b>
<b>Come now, Rose,
a little respect, he's dead now...</b>
<b>You really shouldn't curse.
It's ugly, ugly and impolite.</b>
<b>That's not my fault Lucien.
He taught me that.</b>
<b>I was well behaved until
I met the fucker, son of a...</b>
<b>How come you're still
wearing your slip?</b>
<b>I'd rather you take it off.</b>
Yes, caress me...
<b>I'm coming...</b>
Must be the good news.
<b>The soup smells good.</b>
<b>It's just bean soup,
but homegrown.</b>
<b>His brother back home sends us
a few bags now and then.</b>
<b>- And the bowl's as big as a tureen.
- That was his bowl.</b>
<b>No way. I'll eat his soup,
but not in his bowl.</b>
<b>It's strange how you don't get some things...
It'd ruin my appetite.</b>
<b>You can sleep in his bed, but not
eat from his bowl?</b>
<b>It's not the same. There's only one bed.
So I have to!</b>
<b>But there're other bowls.
It's more proper.</b>
My soup...
<b>Even dead, he pisses me off!</b>
<b>That's a weird dog.</b>
<b>I've never noticed before
he's got a stripe in the middle.</b>
<b>Marcaillou did that.
So we'd each pat one half.</b>
<b>Sounds like poor Marcaillou.</b>
<b>Listen, don't leave me here
all alone tonight. I'll be scared.</b>
<b>It's my first night alone.</b>
<b>There are 3 sorts of French.</b>
<b>Real French, shitty French
and French shit.</b>
<b>You're not even French shit.</b>
<b>That's me on our wedding day.</b>
<b>I didn't want to rot with him.</b>
<b>Drop me before the village.</b>
<b>Wait, Father.</b>
<b>Do help me, yes.</b>
<b>Termites. They've already
eaten up two crosses.</b>
<b>Good thing the Christ's
cast iron, eh?</b>
<b>That should hold it, thank you.</b>
<b>Rose is here. Be nice.
She's anxious about her husband.</b>
<b>Is he sick?</b>
<b>- Worse, maybe.
- Let's go, then.</b>
<b>What's wrong, my dear?</b>
<b>I'm worried something's happened.
He left early with his dog to go hunting.</b>
<b>With his dog?</b>
<b>The dog... yes.</b>
<b>- The dog has come back alone.
- Did you hear? His dog.</b>
<b>- Yeah, I heard, his dog.
- His dog Medore.</b>
<b>Yeah, Medore, the one with the stripe
down the middle.</b>
<b>All alone.</b>
<b>Maybe he got a beating, no?
It doesn't prove a thing.</b>
<b>- Maybe he had an accident.
- Oh, don't say 'accident'.</b>
<b>Who's talking about accidents...</b>
<b>I say it's more likely Medore had an
accident after his master came home.</b>
<b>It's not that difficult
what she's asking!</b>
In the early hours of the morning
in Mexico a man is going to be executed.
We're not savages. We won't shoot anybody
sitting on a Galerie Barbe's chair.
<b>Ah, here you are! I pay you to
prevent gate-crashing.</b>
<b>Why should somebody do that?</b>
<b>Your workers they all get tickets.
Isn't that how you pay them?</b>
<b>Gotta be a stonic to take
that smell.</b>
<b>What's that mean, "stonic"?</b>
Ya mean ya don't know
what it means?
<b>Doesn't it bother
your wife there...</b>
<b>watching the film backwards?</b>
<b>If it's free, even
your shit houses don't bother her.</b>
<b>Good evening Miss. It's a good film tonight.
"Mediterranean Alert".</b>
<b>It's only so they can see the sea.</b>
<b>- No, this is on me, let's go.
- Thank you.</b>
<b>Put it on my tab.</b>
Go ahead, kiddies.
<b>Isn't that Cordier?</b>
<b>Yes, with the schoolteacher.</b>
<b>He could use some learning.</b>
<b>See that outfit?
It's just right for Lucien.</b>
<b>That dress!
With your eyes...</b>
You're so nice to me.
<b>I just love sailors.</b>
<b>Will they show the Riviera?</b>
<b>What's the Riviera?</b>
<b>Shut up girls! The plot's thickening!</b>
<b>- What is it?
- The Côte d'Azur</b>
<b>I thought it was judgment day.</b>
<b>It'd be worse than that.</b>
<b>You should turn in.</b>
<b>I'd miss my chance.</b>
<b>What chance?</b>
<b>The chance of something that has never
happened before.</b>
<b>During the film I had a funny dream...</b>
<b>It's a recurring dream,
about my dad beating me.</b>
<b>I show him my prize
for good reading in school:</b>
<b>A beautiful hard-cover book.
And he throws it in my face.</b>
<b>Because in the dream, I'm a little kid.</b>
<b>But then again this isn't a dream.
I am just a little kid.</b>
<b>A vile little monster who killed
his mother at birth.</b>
<b>Do you still resent your father?</b>
<b>Not any more.</b>
<b>He's one of those people who believes
there's only one answer to every problem</b>
<b>one of those who blames everything
on Jews and Freemasons.</b>
<b>Not seeing you're not going
to find one reason but a thousand,</b>
<b>to why things went wrong,
if they really did go wrong...</b>
<b>I'm cold.</b>
<b>It's warm out.</b>
<b>It's not the weather.</b>
<b>A helluva time for repairs.</b>
<b>But I'm not doing repairs.</b>
<b>- Want help?
- I'm nearly done.</b>
<b>It's for Vanderbruck.</b>
<b>You may be in for a real treat
in the morning.</b>
<b>Do you hate Vanderbruck?</b>
<b>- I don't hate anybody.
- I do.</b>
<b>He's here 2 years
and already rich.</b>
<b>I can't dirty up these mules.</b>
<b>Huguette'd be sore.</b>
<b>Wake up.</b>
<b>No, no...</b>
Vanderbruck's coming.
<b>Always a pain in the butt,
that one...</b>
<b>Quick. This is gonna be fun.</b>
<b>Not up yet, Cordier?</b>
<b>Hurry up... quick!</b>
<b>I was working late last night.</b>
<b>Don't make a habit... Shit!</b>
<b>Take a look! Fast!</b>
<b>Didn't even say 'good morning'</b>
<b>I don't believe it!</b>
<b>Thanks a lot, Cordier.</b>
<b>Get these shit holes out
of my sight!</b>
<b>Forever!</b>
<b>They must vanish.
Just as if they'd never existed.</b>
<b>Sure thing. Go on...</b>
<b>I don't dare.</b>
<b>Excuse me, Mr. Vanderbruck.</b>
<b>That's not funny.</b>
<b>Shit, my hat.</b>
<b>Kiss me, Huguette.
This calls for a celebration!</b>
<b>Whoever dares say I sawed the
boards so a man'd fall in...</b>
<b>and maybe get killed...</b>
<b>- Quit acting like an idiot, Nono-</b>
<b>...would be ruining my career...</b>
accusing me of a serious offense
and a one contrary to my nature.
<b>Everybody knows.
I'm not one to take risks.</b>
<b>That's for sure... sissy.
You're a prize asshole.</b>
<b>Cut it out, blockhead!</b>
<b>You resent Nono
because he's a real man.</b>
<b>There, Nono, my little he-man.
Lucky I have you.</b>
<b>Don't ever say that, Huguette.</b>
<b>Why not, if it's true?</b>
<b>What's got into you, Lucien?</b>
<b>Oh, Rose, you should've seen
the look in his eyes.</b>
<b>Like a killer's.</b>
<b>Me? Killer's eyes?</b>
<b>Eyes don't harm.</b>
<b>Hands do.</b>
Kiss and make up.
<b>Well, kiss him.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>You know, Rose, I've been
thinking... But then again...</b>
maybe it's not a good idea-
that you get a gun...
<b>- To shoot with?
- Not to shoot with, Nono.</b>
Just to keep her man off...
if he comes at her
with bad intentions.
<b>- It is a good idea!
- Not really.</b>
<b>I can't see Rose,
so sweet and frail,</b>
<b>with a big gun
in her little, shaky hand.</b>
<b>And especially 'cause I might
unintentionally kill him.</b>
You see.
<b>- Let's get you a gun.
- Really?</b>
<b>Sure. Come on.</b>
<b>That's a good one.</b>
<b>A pastor's wife shot
her husband with it?</b>
<b>Oh yes!</b>
<b>Have anything bigger?
Something very, very frightening.</b>
<b>A club?</b>
<b>- No, very frightening.
- Really, very, very frightening.</b>
<b>A gas mask.</b>
<b>Hold it.</b>
Good.
<b>- I'll never use it.
- You never know.</b>
You've got an idea in your head.
<b>Not at all, I swear. You know,
I do things and I don't know why.</b>
<b>Later, I understand.
But I never plan ahead.</b>
You're weird sometimes.
<b>You're not scared someday I might
shoot you if you leave?</b>
<b>First learn to shoot,</b>
<b>then I'll be scared.
Go on.</b>
<b>Morning. Did we wake you?</b>
<b>You see what I see?</b>
<b>- See you later.
- Are you following him?</b>
<b>Not him. The ladder.</b>
<b>Scram!</b>
<b>Never a dull moment when he's around!</b>
<b>Are you crazy!</b>
<b>What a sick idiot!</b>
<b>- Let me by.
- This isn't the first time! Should be locked up!</b>
<b>After such a beating, he won't offend again!</b>
<b>You'll be sorry if you touch me.</b>
<b>Play along.
I'm just pretending.</b>
<b>It's better than being
locked up, no?</b>
<b>- O.K. But go easy.
- Sure.</b>
<b>- Not the head.
- Of course.</b>
<b>Take that!</b>
<b>Pig! That'll teach you to peep.</b>
<b>Easy. He still has to bring
home his ladder!</b>
<b>Not the head, eh?</b>
<b>I can't read the aviator's book.</b>
<b>It's annoying me. Perhaps it's
too well written.</b>
<b>You like sounding illiterate.</b>
<b>You're not... So why?</b>
<b>Habit.</b>
<b>Grammar gets rusty
like everything else</b>
<b>if you don't use it. And there isn't
a strong demand for it in Africa.</b>
<b>Just like for
Good and Evil...</b>
<b>What's Good? What's Evil?
Nobody knows.</b>
<b>It's not much use here.
So that gets rusty, too.</b>
<b>Must be the climate.</b>
<b>Do you think it will happen
to me too?</b>
<b>You will never be like others.</b>
<b>It's not that you're prettier
than Rose...</b>
<b>She's my girl, Rose.</b>
<b>No, not prettier, but with you
the difference comes from inside.</b>
<b>Something that grabs you by
the heart like a vice</b>
<b>and doesn't let go.</b>
<b>When I look at you...</b>
<b>I'm ill at ease.</b>
<b>But I can't keep away.</b>
<b>Do you understand that?</b>
<b>Even if we kiss,
it won't make it simpler.</b>
<b>- Bye. Careful with the pistol.
- Don't worry.</b>
<b>Stop it, Nono!</b>
<b>- And if I pretend too?
- It was that or jail.</b>
<b>Leave Nono alone.
Rose is waiting for you.</b>
Kissing the bitch makes me sick.
<b>I promise I'll try to watch it.</b>
Listen.
<b>- What is it, sweet?
- Why, nothing.</b>
<b>I figured as much.</b>
<b>I'm a bit tired...
not enough sleep.</b>
<b>- The schoolteacher's cute.
- You know her?</b>
<b>Not really but I saw her on the
movie screen in silhouette.</b>
<b>You both looked fine
in silhouette.</b>
<b>You were swell, together.</b>
<b>Don't be silly.
She's not that kind.</b>
<b>She's too good for you?</b>
<b>While you're the best I can get?
- Listen...</b>
<b>Having you is an honor...A man
who's killed my husband for love.</b>
<b>No, I was just
getting rid of trash.</b>
<b>The trash also happened to be your husband,
so I killed two birds with one stone.</b>
<b>There's a lot of trash around.</b>
<b>There'll be less and less...
Had to start somewhere.</b>
<b>Well, I want to believe you killed
him on account of me.</b>
<b>Let me go on believing it. Who are you
to tell me what to believe or not believe?</b>
<b>- You're taking your time.
- I'm coming.</b>
<b>I don't believe it. They're all
conspiring to keep me from sleeping.</b>
<b>I'm worn out...</b>
<b>Wait.</b>
<b>What's wrong?</b>
<b>What's with you?</b>
Vicious nag...
<b>- Are you hurt?
- It kicked me in the privates.</b>
<b>- Come in and let me take a look.
- I'll go home.</b>
<b>- I'll fix you up.
- I'll see a doctor.</b>
<b>- You won't get there in this state.
- Are you sure?</b>
<b>Yes. Can you walk?</b>
<b>Barely.</b>
<b>I don't see any bruises.</b>
<b>But it hurts like hell.</b>
<b>Doesn't take much to hurt like hell,
when it's down there.</b>
<b>Here? Or here?</b>
You're too soft.
<b>I am not soft.
Touch me anywhere.</b>
<b>Say, you're not crying in pain now.</b>
<b>Someone's outside.</b>
<b>Hear it?</b>
<b>I'm sure. It's like
something was being dragged.</b>
<b>Wake up!</b>
<b>I'll go and see.</b>
<b>Take your gun at least.</b>
<b>Oh, goddamn!</b>
<b>The son of a bitch is back!</b>
Maybe he's not dead.
<b>He's dead as they come.</b>
<b>- Then he's not alone.
- I doubt that.</b>
<b>Which goddamn son of a bitch
brought him?</b>
<b>There's the bastard.</b>
<b>Stop there, damn you!</b>
<b>Black bastard.
Why'd you bring him back?</b>
<b>- Please, ma'am.
- I'll peel your black ass.</b>
<b>- Forgive me.
- What got into you, for Chrissake?</b>
<b>Stop it! How's things, Friday?
Getting cloudy, eh?</b>
<b>Thank you, Captain, very well.
Yes, it looks like rain.</b>
<b>What got into you to bring him back?
He was fine where he was.</b>
<b>- Stop it.
- You take the trouble...</b>
<b>to kill him and this prick...</b>
<b>Back to the house. Now!</b>
<b>Don't be afraid.</b>
<b>I always treated you right.</b>
<b>That's why you can trust me.</b>
<b>- I'll never tell a soul.
- Good.</b>
<b>I didn't see anything.</b>
<b>You mean like Ma'am Rose naked?</b>
<b>That neither...
Can I go, Captain?</b>
<b>Sure, Friday. Thank you.</b>
But before you go, give me
a hand with burying the body.
<b>White folk aren't meant
for vultures.</b>
<b>Will he have some?</b>
<b>Friday, want some coffee, a piece
of bread, some paté?</b>
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.
<b>I'd better be going, now.</b>
<b>Wait Lucien.</b>
<b>Do you think you'll sleep easy if I let
him go, after what he heard you say.</b>
<b>- Maybe he didn't hear.
- You were yelling it.</b>
Maybe he didn't understand.
<b>You know I swallow my words. They used to
tell me off all the time in school.</b>
<b>Well, this time you didn't swallow them.
I thought you were tougher.</b>
<b>With Marcaillou you took
advantage of the situation.</b>
<b>He was a different story. Friday's a good
black, who's never hurt a fly.</b>
<b>If we looked hard enough...</b>
<b>I know what's bothering you.</b>
<b>When it happens</b>
<b>like with your husband's 'accident'...</b>
<b>when you hear about it later...
...you can say:</b>
<b>"What can I do? I'm not responsible for it."</b>
<b>But this is not the case this time.
This time you know what's gonna happen.</b>
<b>So you're telling me "Don't go."</b>
<b>I can't back out now. Now I must go.</b>
Just checking if you've changed your mind.
<b>I'm coming.</b>
You think he'd wait
if he'd understood?
<b>Tired?</b>
<b>I'm not feeling well, my legs are shaky.</b>
<b>Don't worry, it'll pass.</b>
<b>What's wrong?</b>
<b>You know very well
I have to do it.</b>
<b>But, Captain, I trusted you. You're
different from other white men.</b>
<b>- There's your mistake.
- I've always believed your every word.</b>
<b>No, you didn't.
Now you're lying.</b>
<b>Coming from a good catholic like you
it worries me.</b>
Lying is a sin.
<b>Killing people is a sin too.
And a worse one than lying.</b>
<b>Let me tell you a secret now, and that
it might offer you some consolation.</b>
<b>We all kill what we love.</b>
<b>But you don't love me.</b>
<b>And one more thing.
No, don't tire yourself getting up now...</b>
<b>Better the blind man
who pisses out the window...</b>
<b>than the joker who told him
it was a urinal.</b>
<b>Know who the joker is?
It's everybody.</b>
<b>All the bastards who look away
when you're in shit,</b>
<b>who wallow in their cash,</b>
<b>praying through their assholes
that nothing happens.</b>
<b>If it's true they were made
in God's image,</b>
<b>I wouldn't like to get Him
in a dark alley.</b>
<b>You kissed too much white ass. And now
you're getting fucked, and you asked for it.</b>
<b>So now this is what I do
with friends like you.</b>
<b>Did you do it?</b>
<b>I'm tired of taking
the rap,</b>
for doing what everyone
wants me to do,
<b>and don't have the courage
to do themselves.</b>
<b>- Madam Marcaillou?
- Yes, sir.</b>
<b>Colonel Tramichel -
Tra as in tralala...</b>
<b>This early visit may surprise you.</b>
<b>Please, gather your courage.</b>
<b>Mother of God, no, I don't believe it!</b>
<b>Alas, yes, it's but too true.</b>
<b>There must be two.
This is the second I'm getting.</b>
<b>When is this story going to be over?</b>
<b>Wake up.</b>
<b>There's an officer here to see you.</b>
<b>He says it's urgent.</b>
<b>It's war, for sure.</b>
<b>I don't want you drafted.</b>
<b>But, Huguette
if there's a war</b>
<b>they'll need the police
more than ever</b>
to arrest the ones
who won't fight.
<b>No, listen.</b>
<b>No?</b>
<b>- Away!
- Let it say goodbye to his master.</b>
<b>It doesn't want to say goodbye.
Dogs eat what has scared them, right Medore?</b>
<b>Weird dog... He's got a...</b>
<b>I think the victims were
struck by the same hand.</b>
<b>The same weapon was used
on them both.</b>
<b>I won't say you're wrong,
but I won't say you're right.</b>
<b>I know how it happened.</b>
<b>Friday wanted to get even with my husband
for the beating he got the other day.</b>
<b>So he took the rifle and -see the hole-
shot him point blank.</b>
<b>Then my husband took the rifle back</b>
<b>and killed him before dying.</b>
<b>- A case of self- defense.
- That's how I see it.</b>
<b>This isn't something unheard of Colonel,</b>
two dead men shooting each other.
<b>You're right. It's happened before.</b>
<b>During the war,
a machine-gunner got killed.</b>
But his finger stuck
in the trigger
<b>so his corpse went on
and killed dozens of Huns.</b>
<b>My condolences, dear Lady.</b>
<b>Make sure they're six feet under.
I never want to see them again.</b>
<b>I've never seen a clearer
case of murder.</b>
<b>- Clear as rain water.
- You mean still water.</b>
Yes, sir!
- Kiss me.
- You're forgetting again: It's not proper.
You don't grab a brand-new widow.
<b>Well, I have to wait for tonight then!</b>
Look.
<b>My God... poor little thing.</b>
<b>This whole situation is a real pain!</b>
<b>I've put on the bed a little black
dress of mine I can lend you.</b>
<b>The dirty pig isn't worth
buying a new one.</b>
<b>The veil's a present.</b>
<b>Don't fool with death, Nono.
It's bad luck.</b>
<b>Have more.</b>
<b>Then I won't eat after
the funeral.</b>
<b>Pity though, 'cause this is good food.
- It's lamb stew.</b>
<b>- Need help?
- No, that's all right.</b>
<b>Quit stuffing your face
and look after Rose.</b>
<b>Does that really suit me?</b>
<b>You look pretty, dressed up like a widow.</b>
<b>- A kiss?
- A big one.</b>
<b>Come look.</b>
<b>- Come look.
- What's happening?</b>
<b>I saw them. They were kissing.</b>
<b>- What are you saying?
- Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.</b>
<b>You're losing it!
Why are you making this up?</b>
<b>I saw 'em, I tell you,
in the mirror.</b>
<b>- Shame!
- What's going on?</b>
<b>This is the last time I try
to comfort somebody.</b>
<b>I just told her
to lay her head on my shoulder.</b>
<b>Then I patted her on the back,
like anybody with a heart would.</b>
<b>You, my only true friend...
believing such a horrible lie.</b>
<b>- Not at all.
- Don't listen to those two.</b>
<b>He was feeling up the girl.</b>
<b>- Stop howling.
- I saw them.</b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>- Worst for you, 'cause I saw them.
- So?</b>
<b>I'm ashamed.
I'm going home.</b>
<b>- Are you leaving?
- After what happened...</b>
<b>She loses her husband,
gets insulted...</b>
<b>It's natural she's upset.</b>
<b>You keep out of it.
It's woman's business.</b>
<b>Come and powder your nose
for the funeral.</b>
<b>So, my little Rose...
Your heart mourns.</b>
<b>Not my heart or anything else.</b>
<b>Are you forgetting our Father's words:</b>
<b>"Forgive us our sins..."</b>
<b>"As we forgive others."</b>
<b>No, I haven't forgotten, they're lies
we teach children</b>
and they stick with them, even if they
know it isn't the truth.
<b>Why should I forgive Marcaillou?</b>
<b>You can only forgive those
you love, and even then...</b>
But this isn't something
your good Lord teaches.
<b>But you believe in God?</b>
<b>- Sure.
- Do you truly believe?</b>
<b>I believe, but not truly.</b>
<b>Hey, Father. Is that pigeon
hanging over the church altar</b>
<b>made of gold?
- That pigeon is the Holy Spirit.</b>
<b>I'll say no more.
I don't want to encourage theft.</b>
<b>What's it worth?
Approximately...</b>
<b>- What's that?
- A walking corpse.</b>
<b>- Where's he going?
- He's looking for the cemetery.</b>
<b>- Gonna get buried?
- Out of my way, brats.</b>
<b>Excuse me.
Is Mr. Cordier at the funeral?</b>
<b>That's him over there.</b>
<b>Everybody here thinks
you're dead!</b>
<b>No, Ma'am, that's not true.</b>
<b>Well, I'm glad. You've got
a bill to pay at the laundry.</b>
<b>Four silk pajamas.</b>
<b>I don't wear pajamas,
just nightshirts.</b>
<b>- Holy Jesus!
- What is it?</b>
<b>- A ghost.
- Where?</b>
<b>There!</b>
<b>It's Le Péron.
A ghost has to be dead first.</b>
<b>I didn't think of that.</b>
<b>Warrant-officer George Le Péron.</b>
<b>It's war!</b>
<b>Always the war. Why should I
be the first to know?</b>
<b>It's not the war.</b>
<b>It's about my brother.</b>
<b>- I see the resemblance.
- Hardly.</b>
<b>And how is he?</b>
<b>Dead...</b>
<b>And you know who killed him.</b>
<b>Didn't your regiment squash
the peanut picker's revolt?</b>
<b>- Sure did.
- It sure took guts...</b>
<b>All those blacks
armed with clubs</b>
<b>and all you had
were machine guns!</b>
My brother said you were an ass.
<b>Why try to cover up for his murderer.
You know very well who's done it.</b>
<b>If I knew who it was,
he would already be in jail.</b>
<b>He's a cop, that's why.</b>
<b>Is it your friend, Chevasson?</b>
<b>He's not my friend.</b>
<b>I even refused to put him up
the night of the crime,</b>
<b>which I regret, 'cause if he
hadn't been at the brothel...</b>
<b>Funny, in trying to defend him,
you implicate him even more.</b>
<b>Oh, that's the way I am.
I don't know why.</b>
<b>Fête-Nat! Bring the glasses!</b>
<b>Don't turn around.
He might drop the tray.</b>
You're not afraid of ghosts,
are you?
<b>My grandma saw some, long ago.</b>
<b>After the big war,
God wouldn't let the dead come out.</b>
<b>There'd be too many.</b>
<b>How'd he do it?</b>
<b>Hello, friend.</b>
<b>So now, white folks wait to be dead
to shake the hand of a simple black.</b>
<b>Well, it's too late now.</b>
<b>What I just heard is awful!</b>
<b>Here it is...</b>
<b>Their favorite place.</b>
<b>They were there, so quiet.</b>
<b>What'd they do?</b>
<b>Nothing - like anyone else
when they can help it.</b>
<b>He always liked ratafia...</b>
<b>This might do something...</b>
<b>It brings me closer to him.</b>
<b>To think that he might've
been killed here, my poor brother...</b>
<b>What makes you say that?</b>
<b>Well, he had to be killed
somewhere.</b>
<b>So, why not here?</b>
<b>True.</b>
<b>I'm exhausted.
Walking is tiring...</b>
<b>...but walking and thinking...!</b>
<b>It's funny...</b>
<b>My brother saw you differently.</b>
<b>- May I call you Lucien?
- Of course, George.</b>
<b>My brother sure had
the good life...</b>
Better than ours.
You can say that again.
<b>- No formalities between us?
- It's all right with me.</b>
<b>- The army must be a drag at times.
- Yeah...</b>
<b>But I couldn't do
anything else. And you?</b>
<b>Same for me.</b>
But is doing nothing
<b>a real goal in life?</b>
<b>Not always.</b>
<b>Does it excuse us?</b>
<b>Can you excuse a pole
for filling a hole?</b>
<b>It may squash some rabbits,</b>
<b>but is it the pole's fault
if it fits that hole?</b>
<b>There's no comparison. A pole is
an inanimate object.</b>
<b>Aren't we all more
or less inanimate?</b>
<b>What do you mean?</b>
<b>Who knows!</b>
<b>Look. There's a guy who
won't die in the war.</b>
<b>Sad sight...</b>
<b>Not for everybody. Your
brother enjoyed shooting them.</b>
<b>And you let him?</b>
<b>I'm not a policeman, George...
I'm Jesus Christ in person,</b>
<b>sent here with a load of crosses
each bigger than the next.</b>
<b>I see...</b>
<b>I try to save the innocent
but there aren't any.</b>
<b>All crimes are collective.</b>
<b>We contribute to
each other's crimes.</b>
<b>We all shot your brother...</b>
<b>And maybe I did a bit more
than anybody else.</b>
<b>Strange day!</b>
<b>Now what?</b>
<b>A red and a blue sock!
I must have dressed in the dark.</b>
<b>I have a question
no one has answered yet.</b>
<b>The big question.
- Go ahead.</b>
<b>When you scratch your balls,
is it 'cause they itch</b>
<b>or 'cause it feels good?</b>
<b>I've had an exhausting day.</b>
<b>I get taken for a ghost...
I drink ratafia...</b>
<b>I've heard things and I don't even
know if I really heard them.</b>
<b>But I don't mind 'cause now I know
who killed my brother.</b>
<b>Who?</b>
<b>You told me...</b>
<b>I forgot what I told you.
Could you repeat it?</b>
<b>What matters is what
I didn't tell you.</b>
<b>What didn't you tell me?</b>
<b>Your brother and his mate, I saw them
alive and well the day after the murder.</b>
<b>No... no... no...</b>
<b>What time is it?</b>
<b>Six P.M.</b>
<b>We're entering the virgin forest.</b>
<b>"Women nurse these fierce
invalids returned...</b>
"...from the tropics."
<b>How was my mutton stew?</b>
<b>Even better than the one
Huguette made.</b>
You ate twice!
<b>I can never say no.</b>
<b>Why'd you marry her?</b>
<b>I dunno. She asked me.</b>
<b>What about Rose?</b>
<b>Same thing.</b>
<b>Were you with her when
Marcaillou was shot?</b>
<b>Let's see...
when Marcaillou was shot...</b>
<b>It's strange... we've got so much
inside our heads...</b>
but when we want to use it...
<b>Nothing!</b>
<b>Why do you ask?</b>
<b>It was good for Rose.</b>
<b>Even better for Marcaillou!
He was a brute.</b>
<b>Whoever killed him, did him a favor.</b>
<b>Better, a charitable act.</b>
But not everybody
can understand that.
<b>I'm not everybody, Lucien.</b>
<b>No, don't.</b>
But why?
<b>Don't.</b>
<b>When I pity someone,
it's bad for them and me.</b>
<b>Why are you so late?</b>
<b>I'm exhausted, Rose.</b>
<b>Sleep is all you do.</b>
<b>It's the best thing,
besides eating.</b>
<b>When you eat or sleep,</b>
<b>you forget about the things
you can't solve.</b>
<b>Think about it.
You'll see I'm right.</b>
<b>It's not thinking I need.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>I'm praying for strength.</b>
<b>You think it'll work?</b>
<b>I'm so weak I couldn't
stick my finger in a cherry pie.</b>
<b>It's working!
Thank the Good Lord!</b>
<b>It's the least he could do.</b>
<b>GOD TOLD ME TO KILL THEM.
I WASN'T SURE. JESUS CHRIST.</b>
<b>- Can anyone read that?
- No, Ma'am.</b>
<b>It's the beginning of
"La Marseillaise".</b>
Children of the land
the day of glory's come...
...The bloody flag of
tyranny's against us...
Very good!
<b>The rice pudding's gone!</b>
<b>I had to shape up before
taking Rose home.</b>
<b>About time she's gone.</b>
<b>Aren't you done yet?</b>
<b>- What's taking you so long today?
- I'm drinking my coffee.</b>
<b>If you only bothered to look,
you'd see it's true.</b>
<b>Drink it somewhere else.</b>
<b>You're serving lunch in a bit,
so why should I get up now?</b>
<b>O. K, stay there.</b>
<b>I'm off to the hairdresser now and
I won't be back for your lunch.</b>
<b>How's she gonna turn up this time?</b>
<b>You spoil my appetite.</b>
<b>What are the odds
that war's declared?</b>
<b>You really want it?</b>
<b>Yeah! I waited so long!</b>
<b>- But you'll have to fight.
- Think so?</b>
<b>They'll put you straight in with
the Senegalese fusiliers</b>
<b>But I'm not from Senegal!</b>
<b>And the black units
are the shock troops.</b>
<b>Highest casualty rate!</b>
<b>Oh yeah?</b>
<b>I guess a war's
not so good...</b>
<b>I'll clear out.</b>
<b>But I'd need money.
I don't got any.</b>
<b>But I got a friend who does.</b>
<b>A friend?</b>
My sister's husband.
<b>- I didn't know he was your friend.
- Well, if you weren't...</b>
<b>I'd tell Huguette
all about you and Rose.</b>
<b>Poor Nono... What supposedly
happened is nothing.</b>
<b>Absolutely nothing compared
to what might happen very soon.</b>
<b>I've lost a button. I'm looking for needle
and thread.</b>
<b>Found it?</b>
<b>Please put it back in order,</b>
<b>so Huguette doesn't have to do it,
because I won't be here tonight.</b>
<b>And don't look for the money.
I've taken it all.</b>
<b>Coming! I'm just getting some ice.</b>
<b>Last night I dreamt God,
had turned into a black,</b>
<b>just as Marcaillou was
on his way to Heaven.</b>
<b>So that fool didn't even
try to get in.</b>
<b>He said "Such rotten luck.
I get killed,</b>
my wife fucks around,
and God's a nigger!"
<b>This is the kind of dream you have
after eating too much mutton stew.</b>
<b>Fakir Birman's horoscope!</b>
<b>Look, Pisces, that's my sign.</b>
<b>"You will soon make a voyage
for romantic reasons."</b>
<b>- Where'll we go?
- That's last year's paper!</b>
<b>So what? The words are still there.</b>
<b>Do you think we still have a chance
in the next world? You, Huguette, myself,</b>
<b>all the blacks full of good will
and that counted so little?</b>
My dream made you say that?
Maybe.
<b>Want to come with me?</b>
<b>Where?</b>
<b>To eat fish by the river.</b>
<b>I thought we'd go farther.</b>
<b>You're eating at home.
In fact, you're late. My dinner's burning!</b>
<b>Sure you won't come?</b>
I'm sure!
<b>Too bad!</b>
<b>- See you later, darling!
- See you!</b>
<b>Over there.</b>
<b>I'm worried! He tore
my room apart before he left.</b>
<b>I've never seen him like this.
He was crazy.</b>
You didn't see him?
<b>I keep telling you he's not here!</b>
<b>Of course, he might be
in the cupboard.</b>
Just 'cause he's not
isn't any proof!
<b>- You don't know where he went?
- Haven't seen him since last night.</b>
<b>Since last night!</b>
<b>And that hat there,
did it walk in alone?</b>
<b>So you sleep with the creep.
It's too disgusting!</b>
<b>And you and Nono?</b>
<b>- It's not the same. I love Nono.
- Sugar, sugar...</b>
<b>Don't change subject! I'll make you
spit it out. Where's the dough!</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>
Where's my money?
<b>That money's mine, not his.
I saved it up</b>
<b>to get the hell out.</b>
<b>I deserve some good times...</b>
<b>to see the Riviera...</b>
<b>I didn't spend 15 years here to be ripped
off by a whore like you. I'm warning you!</b>
<b>I never saw your money!</b>
<b>You seen Nono's hands?</b>
<b>What's wrong with them?</b>
<b>He can get nasty, Nono! One
last time, where's my dough?</b>
<b>That's enough!
Shut your fucking face...</b>
<b>and if you move, I'll clean
the shit outta your brains!</b>
<b>- What'd she say?
- Don't listen do it!</b>
<b>- Do what?
- Give her one! She'll talk.</b>
<b>Don't touch me.</b>
Let me go, you bastard!
My money!
Mama!
<b>Don't let her go!</b>
<b>Colonel!</b>
<b>Tramichel. Tra as in tralala...</b>
<b>War's been declared!
I heard it on the wireless!</b>
<b>How distressing.</b>
<b>It's just like Daladier
to pull a trick like that.</b>
<b>It's typical...
I just knew it...</b>
<b>Of course... Daladier...</b>
<b>Until we get our orders,
we'll have to make do.</b>
<b>Get out from under my legs.</b>
<b>They're nice but a bit...
clinging.</b>
<b>Attention!</b>
<b>War has just been declared
between France and Germany!</b>
<b>General mobilization!</b>
<b>Lucien, it's awful.
Huguette... Nono...</b>
<b>I know, I was there.</b>
You saw everything?
<b>Let's say I heard everything.
It's the same.</b>
<b>And you did nothing?</b>
<b>Why should I? Coffee?</b>
<b>Why... to stop me.</b>
<b>It wasn't up to me to stop you.</b>
<b>It was up to you, to Huguette,
Nono, Marcaillou.</b>
<b>I might lead you into temptation, but is
this a good enough reason not to stop?</b>
<b>I just help people to reveal
their real nature.</b>
<b>It's a dirty job, Rose!</b>
<b>And you might very well say I deserve
all the dirty pleasure I get out of it.</b>
<b>Aren't you ashamed of speaking like this?</b>
<b>That's yet another aspect of my business,
enjoying other people's misery.</b>
<b>You've gone completely insane!</b>
<b>No, quite the opposite. I should
crack down the rich and powerful</b>
<b>but that's just what I'm not
allowed to do.</b>
<b>So I make up for it
by coming down twice as hard</b>
<b>on the poor, the wretched, the blacks.</b>
<b>And poor girls like you who've
put their brains where I won't say.</b>
<b>Does that make you cry?
Don't. It won't help you.</b>
<b>You know, I've sobbed
my heart out.</b>
<b>It didn't solve anything.</b>
<b>You can't get out of it so easily.</b>
<b>Don't look at me like that!
You heard me!</b>
<b>I can't believe it.</b>
Lucien, why did you do it?
<b>I must get out of this situation.
You've gotta help me.</b>
<b>- I really don't know what to do.
- How the hell should I know?</b>
<b>Any idiot can see it's your gun and
your fingerprints!</b>
<b>But that's horrible!</b>
<b>At first, you're right, it is horrible,</b>
but then you start to think about
a thousand other different things:
<b>Starving kids, girls sold as slaves for
a mirror, women whose sex is sewn up...</b>
and you start thinking God created
murder out of pure kindness.
<b>'Cause what is murder compared to all
of those horrors?</b>
<b>So, my little Rose,
the only thing to do is scram.</b>
But where to?
<b>Listen, I'd be glad to lend you
the money for the boat.</b>
<b>You'll manage, I'm sure of that.</b>
<b>You could make a mint
just doing what you like best.</b>
<b>Which, by the way, you do better
than any woman I've known.</b>
<b>And being as we'll probably
never see each other again,</b>
<b>I'll be glad to have a last
quick one with you,</b>
even though you're a fugitive.
<b>How am I going to get up
in time for mass?</b>
<b>If you so much as touch me,
I'll rip your eyes out.</b>
<b>Even if I go,
don't think you'll get off.</b>
<b>It may take a lifetime,
but I'll see you dead.</b>
<b>Look at him. That makes him laugh.</b>
<b>It's those two dogs down there.</b>
<b>Do you know why dogs sniff
each other's butts?</b>
<b>When dogs still
ruled the world</b>
<b>they held a convention
to vote new laws</b>
<b>The head dog said:
"I suggest that</b>
<b>due to poor hygiene here,
our assholes be left at the door."</b>
<b>The dogs agreed
and de-assholed.</b>
<b>But just then,
a tornado blew in</b>
<b>and mixed all the assholes up.</b>
<b>Not one dog recognized his own.</b>
<b>Ever since, they smell
each other's asses</b>
<b>and it'll go on 'til
the end of time.</b>
<b>- Funny, isn't it?
- Very.</b>
Attention! Curfew
tonight at 9 o'clock...
<b>Stop! There's no more war!</b>
<b>- What?
- There's no war!</b>
<b>- Already?
- They've signed at Munich.</b>
<b>Tonight we celebrate.</b>
<b>Cordier, they've
signed at Munich.</b>
<b>He doesn't give a shit,
if there's a war or not, can't you see?</b>
<b>Don't say that, Rose.</b>
<b>Shut up! I've had enough
of your bullshit!</b>
<b>I might not be very bright but I did
notice you're justifying your every move.</b>
<b>One must always search for the
real reason for things, Rose.</b>
<b>You're being a little too harsh, Rose.</b>
<b>And then, doubting my good intentions.</b>
<b>There are times I could swear there
isn't a mean bone in my body.</b>
<b>But now I wonder...</b>
<b>They say there's only one death
but a hundred ways of dying.</b>
<b>I hope yours will be the worst.</b>
<b>Why did you write that on the blackboard?</b>
<b>Because I don't love you enough?</b>
<b>You mustn't love me, Anne.</b>
<b>It's not because of you,
but my job.</b>
<b>Being with you would prevent me
from doing it right.</b>
<b>And I can't allow that.</b>
<b>There are thousands of unhappy
people, and I'm all alone...</b>
<b>Then you shouldn't have told me.</b>
<b>I didn't need to know.</b>
<b>I had to.</b>
You're not afraid?
<b>Afraid of what?</b>
<b>Of what might happen...</b>
<b>That's not important.</b>
<b>Anyway, I've been dead
for such a long time.</b>
