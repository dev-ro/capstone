Under the burning
African sun,
Cochin-China, Madagascar,
a mighty phalanx
hoisted up our banners.
lts motto, "Honor and Valor,"
makes for brave soldiers.
lts flag, that of France,
is a sign of glory.
Hello. Djibouti.
Marseilles, late February.
l have time to kill now.
l screwed up,
from a certain point of view,
and viewpoints count.
Angles of attack.
My story is simple.
The story of a man
who left France for too long,
a soldier who left the Army
as a sergeant.
Chief Master Sergeant Galoup.
That's me.
Unfit for life.
Unfit for civil life.
Did you fish a lot
in Sicily?
With my father,
when l was a kid.
l fished
with my Uncle Livio.
He moved to Turin.
He taught me.
Careful.
You use bread as bait?
lt's better than cheese.
That depends.
One day, a plane from France
dropped off some new guys.
l noticed one of them
who stuck out.
He was thin, distant.
He had no reason to be with us
in the Legion.
That's what l thought.
l felt something vague
and menacing take hold of me.
Gilles Sentain was his name,
the name he gave to the Legion
when he signed up.
Maybe freedom begins
with remorse.
Maybe freedom begins
with remorse.
l heard that somewhere.
My muscles are rusty.
l'm rusty,
eaten away by acid.
Under the burning African sun,
Cochin-China,
Madagascar,
a mighty phalanx
hoisted up our banners.
lts motto, "Honor and Valor"...
What counts above all
is discipline in the Legion.
Loving one's superior,
obeying him,
that's the essence
of our tradition
Training, guard duty,
washing, ironing, time off--
The routine.
How many stripes are there?
1 , 2, 3, 4...
Are there 13 of them?
Yes.
Good. We always sit on mats
with 13 stripes.
We're attached
to the custom.
lt's a tradition.
How much
are you selling it for?
10,000.
Good price.
Not long ago, they cost
between 1 4,000 and 16,000.
Mine is 10,000.
Prices went up
during the celebration.
lt's so cheap.
What did you pay for it?
l made it myself.
Bruno.
Bruno Forestier.
l feel so alone when l think
of my superior.
l respected him a lot.
l liked him.
My Commandant.
A rumor dogged him
after the Algerian war.
He never confided in me.
He said he was a man
without ideals,
a soldier without ambition.
l admired him
without knowing why.
He knew l was a perfect Legionnaire,
and he didn't give a damn.
Bruno.
Bruno Forestier.
And there was Ali.
Ali bought him his qat.
Night after night,
Forestier chewed on it, alone,
with Ali or someone else,
or at a friend's house.
l never touched
those leaves.
l liked to stay on edge.
Forestier,
Sentain,
and me, Galoup.
Only one of us managed to stay
in the family,
in the 13th Section,
in the Legion.
There was something so strange
that night,
a sort of harbinger
of things to come,
of the circumstances that sent me
far from the Red Sea and Djibouti.
Sentain walked ahead
of the others.
Ramadan had just begun.
The arcades
were all lit up.
My bastards are good kids.
They're your only family.
You're a father
looking out for your sons.
Could be.
Guess how much
a colored girl costs here.
You're a pain, Ali.
What are you thinking?
lf it weren't for fornication and blood,
we wouldn't be here.
That's all.
ln triumph,
they carried one of their own.
One of their own.
We're taught elegance
in and under our uniforms.
Perfect creases
are part of this elegance.
Good, Cosse.
Here l am, Commandant,
like a watchdog,
looking after your flock.
- Tank top?
- Yes.
What's this?
Shirt.
That's right.
- Boxers?
- Underwear.
- Shirt.
- Right.
Good.
Socks.
l can speak French.
Why did you join the Legion?
Commandant,
you know what it's like in Russia.
No money, no work.
l was in the army there
for two years.
l fought for Russia.
But it's impossible to fight
just for an ideal,
an ideal
that keeps changing.
You know what l mean?
What ideal?
How much?
1 ,000?
l'm rambling,
ruminating.
Begging for a word, a gesture.
My beautiful...
Rahel.
Sentain seduced everyone.
He attracted stares.
People were drawn
to his calmness, his openness.
Deep down,
l felt a sort of rancor,
a rage brimming.
l was jealous.
He doesn't like you.
Beware.
Where's the baklava?
You should have
lit them first!
We just want to eat it.
Blow them out.
Thanks, guys.
So l'm 18 now.
First we just heard
a deafening noise.
A helicopter was practicing
emergency maneuvers above the sea.
For a reason still unknown
to the experts,
it plunged headfirst
into the sea.
lt was then that Sentain's heroism
came to the fore.
One person died,
Pierre, the Corsican.
That day, something overpowering
took hold of my heart.
l thought about the end.
The end of me.
The end of Forestier.
Sentain, step forward.
Yes, sir.
Congratulations.
You did your duty.
You acted bravely,
selflessly, and levelheadedly.
l'm proud of you,
as is the entire Legion.
- Back in line.
- Yes, sir.
Get in position!
Down, up, down, up.
Midway, up, midway, up...
Javanese defense.
Well, then...
Going out of your way
to make me squirm,
but l'll pull through.
How about this?
The game is starting
to interest me.
l'm going to...
Just you try.
l told him to be careful
about Sentain.
He answered:
"You put too much faith
in appearances."
"No, Commandant."
"He has something
up his sleeve."
"Don't say
l didn't warn you."
Careful what you're saying.
Backstabbing isn't
in the Legion's honor code.
Can l help you?
A Swiss newspaper.
ln French.
From Geneva.
l don't want one
that no one reads.
Feeling blue, Galoup?
No, l'm fine.
You're a rock,
the epitome of the Legion.
Yeah, right.
Keep Sentain away
from Forestier.
Go far from Djibouti
with the guys.
Set up camp.
Say we're going to repair a road.
Move it on through.
Now all that is no more.
Now those mountains and deserts
are just things,
information stocked
in my memory.
Now that l'm traveling this road
through the past,
l'm sorry l was that man,
that narrow-minded
Legionnaire.
What did l see
of wild camels,
of shepherds
appearing from nowhere,
women in bright colors
in fields of stone, all those images?
lt was an arid plateau
overlooking the sea,
lined with the remains
of workers' barracks.
We set up camp
in this desolate terrain.
The three volcanoes.
Like sentinels.
Legionnaires!
On my order...
Dig!
You're a bottomless pit!
Get lost.
Shut up, faggot.
l have to eat. l have to.
Shut up and eat.
You're a real comrade.
Sentain,
you're in such good shape,
you can clean the lavatory.
Ramadan began
for three of my men.
They sat to the side
as we ate.
Are six onions enough?
Add another one.
Make it tastier.
There must be a chip
in Sentain's armor.
We all have a trash can
deep within.
That's my theory.
l'll kill you!
Cosse! Tong!
Motherfucker!
Stop it!
Galoup?
Wake up, my boy.
Legionnaires, on my order...
Attention!
At ease.
Thank you, Legionnaire.
How old are you?
Twenty-two.
Get along with your parents?
l don't have a mother
or a father.
You know nothing of them?
No, sir.
l was found in a stairwell.
Found?
Fuck!
At least it was a nice find.
Keep at it.
l looked
at the desolate Goubeth,
thinking my black thoughts.
People tell many stories
about this wasteland:
the Devil...
Hey, you Muslims!
Evil spirits,
the evil eye...
Spaghetti with meat sauce.
lt's great!
Let's see your food.
Delicious!
That stuff looks like coyote food.
Where's CombE?
He went to take a leak, sir.
He deserted his post.
No, he went
to take a leak, sir.
He deserted his post.
Section, on my order...
Attention!
At ease.
Dig.
You'll stop when l say so.
Fall out.
You'll be sorry, Sentain,
believe me.
l see what you're up to.
We don't need guys
like you here.
You're in my power.
l will destroy you.
l'll set my trap.
The compass...
the compass...
Bakka!
You're not African anymore.
You're a Legionnaire now.
That's unfair, sir.
See you soon, sir.
Say hi
to the Commandant for me.
Sentain never came back.
People said he deserted.
He could easily have crossed
the mountains into Ethiopia.
1 ,000 francs.
Tierno recognized
Sentain's compass.
For him, Sentain fell prey
to someone's ill will.
Soon Forestier summoned me.
l said to him:
"Admit that you hate me for it."
You know the rules.
You knew what you were in for.
You have no choice now.
Repatriation
for disciplinary reasons.
Court-martial.
You'll be convicted.
Your Legion days are over.
All over.
So is he your boyfriend?
Yes.
How are things between you?
We get along well.
Why are you smiling?
You make me laugh.
Good-bye and good riddance,
Frenchie.
Don't ever come back.
But the Legion must be off,
be off.
Be off to go a-fighting.
Jeannine,
l'll be coming home.
No question about it.
But the bullets all around me
know no laws.
Lost...
Lost...
