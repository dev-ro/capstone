Dude, the motor is not working.
We can take it back after the wedding.
- That's fine.
Uncle, where is Minimol?
Father, shall we?
Why?
Didn't you go to get the motor?
Liked it?
Hey Joseph!
There are people at every corner.
What can I do?
go meet Kunjachan and ask him
to get her married to you.
Can you please talk to him?
Don't tell anyone, Father.
Isn't it better to drown my daughter
in this lake, than doing that?
You have your prayers
and everything, right?
And not the Father ofthe Church.
When did you come?
-I came yesterday.
He won't get that girl married to you.
it should be with people
who are equal to you.
What did he say?
Nothing.
You carry on.

I can't tolerate this any longer.
After two years, she got married to Peter.
Whenever I went somewhere,
I'd drop our daughter at her place.
Hi.
Mommy darling!
What's special today?
After a long time,
I told her everything.
Peter didn't have a
problem in us meeting.
Doctor said that there's no point in
keeping her on the ventilator anymore.
It's been over 40 days since Diana
has been on the ventilator here.
The infection has also
increased quite a bit.
I know it's cruel to ask something
likethis, atthis point oftime.
Diana will live through many others,
through organ donation.

hereafter'

with the sand within my palm'
'Only that belongs to me'
'Only you are beside my heart, my love,
hereafter'

Did the people who came in the car,
make calls from here?
Around what time did
the accident happen?
Hello sir.

Sudhi...
We need to do a mobile dumping.
Stella's accident was
created deliberately.
lfthey had intended to kill her,
Why do they need to
create a witness?
lfthere's a witness, it will be registered
under the accident case section.
For the relatives to get money...
That's how she had a
fracture on her left hand.
That's not such a
serious injury.
the cause of death is a deep
cut behind Stella's head,
would there be such a deep
injury behind her head?
If it was an accident that happened
unknowingly, he would have looked back.
The carwhich came after them,
came only to take Stella.
Did she go for the morning
Qurbana daily?
I need to see her
room and her phone.
Okay then.
Okay.
After the accident,
I'll call from them too.
Please attend those calls.
They can precisely know where this call
came from, from which part of which tower.
they would give us details of all
calls made in this area at that time.

Since they are not from this place,
Okay. Let me draw all this together.

It was an old car with a boot, sir.
Yes. This is the one.
Yes. This one.
Sir, our drawing is complete.
Someone like this, sir.
It's a black Ford lkon.
Call your old buddies.
Make it fast.

Stella had any kind ofthreats or problems.
I couldn't find anything unnatural.

Because, my blood group
