There you are!
You didn't think I'd
catch you, did you?
-Whoop!
-Wee!
Wee!
-Are you happy?
-Yes.
-Are you excited?
-Uh-huh.
Anna!
Anna! Anna!
Anna!
Please God, no.
That's Count Mitterhaus.
Count Mitterhaus, I'm
Jenny, Jenny Schilt.
Your child, your
child is missing.
Your child is missing.
And now your child is missing.
Peter, we've got to go on.
We must. Don't
you understand that?
You've got to listen to me.
We must go on.
This man is evil.
He's the cause
of everything that--
Albert, he's the Count.
If we dare touch him,
he'll have us all hanged.
Your daughter's in there.
I beg of you.
And my wife, Anna.
Anna, one lust feeds the other.
Tell him that we must go on.
Well as Mayor I
say, we should go on.
For the Count to
have us all hanged.
Well, I'm leaving.
Schilt? Schilt, no,
not you, not you.
Your daughter is in
there with my wife.
If your wife's in there,
maybe she wanted to go.
Heave!
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me.
-She's been killed.
-Killed by a vampire!
Anna? Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna! Anna!
You! What have you
done with my wife?
Only what she
wanted, schoolmaster.
Get out of the way, lad!
Get one behind him!
His heart, it must be his heart!
None of you will live.
The town of Stetl will die.
Your children will die
to give me back
my life.
The Count is dead!
We've killed him!
We've rid our village of evil!
Into the coffin, men!
-No! Not that way!
-Let go! Let go of me!
She must die,
she's gotta be killed.
This way is better.
Yeah.
No! No!
No, let go!
Let go!
No!
Albert? No.
Don't let them.
Stop! Albert?
Albert! Let me go!
Forgive me, Albert!
Ow! Please stop it!
-Stop it! Stop it, please!
-Save me, Albert!
I beg you, that's enough.
Anna!
Let her die in there, Albert.
-Die? What about our child?
-Better no mother at all
than a mother who
serves the devil.
Destroy the castle!
You, put this
against the north wall.
Right!
Put that in the courtyard.
Here, here, put
those on the stairs.
The Circus of Nights.
My cousin,
Emil,
he will know, know
what you must do.
Twelve dead, even the priests.
If the lord can't save his own,
God knows what's
going to happen.
God only knows how many
people are ill with this thing.
You still say there
isn't a curse on us?
It's a disease, something
that can be stopped.
It's more than that,
and we know it.
And so do all the people
in the villages around.
Why else do you think
they put up roadblocks.
Kept us all pinned
in here like lepers.
They're frightened
of catching the illness.
That's reason enough.
If it's just an illness,
why can't you cure it?
'Cause I don't have
the correct medicine.
You don't even know
what's causing it.
Well, do you?
Admit it!
No, I don't. I don't have to.
If I can get past
the roadblocks,
I can bring back knowledge
and medicines from the capital
to stamp out the
disease, whatever it is.
How do we know you'll come back?
Would you prefer
to go in my place?
Well, I wouldn't know what
medicines to obtain, would I?
I thought not.
Now, sign here,
please, as your authority.
Dr. Kersh, no
medicines will help us.
Fifteen years ago, we
thought we killed a demon,
but he has been waiting
in his castle to kill us.
Your children will die.
Now, stop it. Stop it!
Your two boys, and your
daughter, and my Rosa,
they're all well.
For how long?
The town of Stetl will die.
Mitterhaus' curse.
You weren't there.
You didn't have
to risk your life
to drive a stake into his heart.
I did.
Fifteen years ago
we killed a man.
There are no vampires,
the doctor told us
that and I believe it.
I killed a man who seduced
and killed the
daughters of this village.
And who helped him, eh?
Forgive me, Albert, I...
Mitterhaus has left his
curse, nothing supernatural,
you allowed that wreck of
a castle to grow and fester
into a breeding ground for
who knows what diseases.
Vermin and filth, those bats.
-Vampire bats--
-Bats, damn you!
Must you go on
believing old wives tales?
The vampires exist
only in legends,
the imaginings of sick and
diseased minds, nowhere else.
Legends, nowhere else.
The Circus of Nights!
A hundred delights!
The Circus of Nights!
A hundred delights!
The Circus of Nights!
A hundred delights!
The Circus of Nights!
A hundred delights!
Hey, woman! Gypsy woman!
Gypsy!
Can you hear me?
How did you get
past the roadblocks?
Didn't they tell you about us?
They didn't have to.
Everyone knows Stetl is dying.
Why have you come?
To steal the money
from dead men's eyes.
The Circus the Nights!
A hundred delights!
Well, if they got
in, I'll get out.
Good luck and god speed.
-Is everything ready, Anton?
-Yes, father.
Doctor! Doctor!
My wife and I,
we're both very ill.
You'll have to help us.
Please will you help us.
My son will be back.
He'll do what he
can for you, Heinz.
Look, there's the roadblock.
I'll go first and
draw their fire.
I don't want you to.
And I don't want to do it.
-Do you know another way?
-No.
I'll ride to the left.
Good luck, Father.
Luck? Remember,
we make our own luck.
Try and see Dora in the capital.
Tell her she must stay there.
Giddy up.
Easy.
Easy, come on, steady. Whoa!
Hurry, someone's
trying to break through!
Stop! That over there,
someone, stop him!
He's getting through!
Stop firing!
Wait! It's all right,
I'm going back!
I'm going back!
Boom!
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle!
And now, may I present,
your Burgermeister
and his beautiful family.
Hello! Hello, everybody!
Make way!
-Your seat, sir.
-Here we are.
And now, I wish to present
an entertainment
which has given pleasure
to many of the crowned
heads of Europe.
Ladies and gentleman,
citizens of Stetl,
tonight for your eyes alone,
Faber and Serena!
-Oh, whoa!
-Hmm...
Bravo!
Ah, our hero returns.
How goes the battle?
Well, it goes well.
Bravo, mon capitaine!
Ah! Go, the enemy is here.
Is it well?
I think he got through.
I told him to find Dora
and tell her to stay away.
Thank you, Anton.
I love her too.
I know that.
Back, back!
Down, down. Quietly.
Emil!
Ladies and gentleman,
the performance is over.
Oh, oh!
My son, he's gone!
They've taken him!
They've taken Gustav!
She's taken him!
-She?
-We must find him.
We must get him back.
There must be a chance.
Papa!
Papa, Mama!
I was running to look
into the panther's cage.
Suddenly it was
all black and dark,
but this man saved me.
I don't know how to thank you.
♪ The Circus of Night ♪

What is it, Rosa?
I just...
Shouldn't you be home?
Yes, I suppose I should.
Emil will take you home.
Won't you, Emil?
Emil, not yet!
Not yet, Emil. It is not time.
I won't stay at home. I won't!
Rosa, shh, keep your voice down.
Please, Mama.
Oh, Rosa.
Your father doesn't
know what time
you came home
last night, but I do.
Oh, Mama.
A circus performer...
A gypsy, someone
we know nothing about.
He's not.
He's been every
where, seen so much.
Not like the boys here. Please!
Sometimes I think please was
the first word you
learned to say.
Only because I was
so old when you came.
You weren't old.
You're not old.
Obviously not.
Or I'd know better than to
let you always have your way.
Thank you, Mama! Thank you!
Thank you, Mama!
Isn't it wonderful?
The circus, isn't it
wonderful having them here?
The sins of the
father shall be visited
on the children
and their parents.
Fifteen years cousin Mitterhaus,
but now we are here to free you,
to give you life.
Must they all die?
Their parents killed him.
The Burgermeister,
Hauser,
School teacher Mueller.
-But must they all die?
-All!
Ooh!
Whoa!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Oh!
I wonder who he's
picked out tonight.
It's all right, Schilt, there's
nothing to fear, nothing.
Emil.
Emil!
Now for another gilde.
Some of you may look
into the Mirror of Life.
And it is only right that his
honour, the Burgermeister,
should be the first
to see the light.
Oh, no, sir. Don't you see?
For you sir, everything is free.
Huh.
Papa, tell us what do you see.
It's not life, just distortions.
Oh, there's one more
mirror, then I'm coming out.
Well, what do you
see now, Peter?
Nothing.
None of you will live.
The town of Stetl will die.
And your children will die.
Give me back my life.
-Papa!
-Peter?
-Pa?
-My husband.
Peter, Peter.
The Count,
Mitterhaus, the curse.
He is here.
What is it?
What have you done to him?
Help us take him home.
I warned him the Count
would revenge himself.
We must get away.
Don't worry, I arranged
it with the circus people.
-Oh!
-Mom!
Come on, you little...
I've got you, here.
Here, sit there. All right?
We have passed the roadblock.
Oh, bless you.
Don't bless me, pay me!
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Don't leave us!
All dead.
That will keep the
others from trying to leave.
Tonight, the children.
The Circus of Night
a hundred delights.
The Circus of Night
a hundred delights...
Now rest, rest.
Circus of Night a
hundred delights.
What happened to
him at the mirrors?
Now rest.
Circus of Night a
hundred delights.
The Circus of Night
a hundred delights.
Do something, I
have to speak to him.
There's nothing I can do.
-Anton!
-Don't you understand?
He's going to die.
I'll come back tonight.
Try and get Hauser
to leave him alone.
Are you and Rosa all right?
She's asleep.
She stayed out all last night.
I tried to stop her.
I think she was, that
man from the circus.
Oh, I know.
He isn't the first.
Oh, I wish they'd never come.
Give this to Dora.
She wanted her to have it.
I will.
At the moment, she's
safe in the city, thank God.
She came this way.
-Did you see who it was?
-No.
But she must
still be here about.
Well, let's go back.
I'm not going any
closer to the village.
Why do you frighten
these poor people?
Fear drives out fear
as death drives out death.
Where do you come from?
From everywhere and nowhere.
-Go home to your daughter.
-Dora is not here.
Not yet, school teacher.
Dora, my child.
Oh.
The Schilts, God help them.
God help us.
It must have been the men
at one of the roadblocks
that killed them.
It was one of the jungle
beasts from the circus.
I should never have
let those people stay.
The circus animals are caged.
They couldn't have done it.
Then who tore
their bodies, Anton?
Wolves, wild boar?
No, Anton, you didn't see it.
Why are you so anxious
to protect the circus?
I'm just trying to keep
everyone from
going mad, that's all.
Well, you were ready to
lynch the gipsies that first night,
and it turned out they
helped find your son.
Anton, take Dora to the
house, will you? Come.
It might have been
men from the roadblock.
Who knows what lengths
people from other villages will go to
to frighten us.
Haven't you heard that
the plague is getting worse?
I missed you so much.
You shouldn't have come back.
Anton!
Didn't my father tell
you in the capital?
I didn't see him there.
But he did get
through, I saw him.
All I know is that I
had to be with you,
and Father, whatever the risk.
Oh, Dora.
Do you think I'm trying
to hide something?
How can you be so
sure about the animals?
All right, I'll prove it to you.
I'll take you to
the circus tonight--
Come along you two.
They're angry and irrational
because they're afraid.
They can't understand
why you defend the circus.
Because the circus is the
one thing that keeps people
from brooding about
death and disease.
Well, Helga and
Heinrich seem to fly,
and the gypsy woman
and her animals,
well, they play with
death, they defy it.
They play no games.
They are death.
The animals can't harm
anyone, they're in cages.
I still think they're
frightening and dangerous.
Let me show you
something interesting.
Nice tiger.
Helga!
You see?
The animals are quite harmless.
Did you enjoy the circus?
Where are your
mother and father?
They said we weren't to come.
But you're young, eh?
And a circus is for the young.
Would you like to
see inside the mirror?
But we don't have any money.
Ah well, for two brave boys,
I think we can
make an exception.
What's supposed to happen?
I don't know.
Would you like to
know how it's done?
Look, they have no reflection.
And your children will die
to give me back my life.
Hauser's sons are the
first of the children to die.
Who next?
The Burgermeister's
daughter, Rosa?
Or the school teachers
daughter, Dora Mueller?
No.
I'll fight her!
Smash what's left
of your brains in!
Hurry!
You're lying!
You're lying!
You chased those boys
away to avoid the plague.
You liar!
-And you don't want anyone to know!
-Help me!
So you blamed it on us!
Help me!
Help me!
The boys! The boys!
They're here!
They're here, come quickly!
The boys, the boys are here!
There they are.
It must have been the Count.
I've heard it, noises
from underneath here.
The Count, coming back from hell
to do what he swore he would.
Today it is the Hauser
boys, it'll be my Rosa next.
She stays away all night.
You know it's that panther.
Kill them, we must
kill all the animals.
No, Peter!
-Kill 'em, kill 'em!
-No, please!
-Please, stop him.
-Why? He's right.
Ah, ah, the others are
afraid, like they were before.
But you and I, we
know what to do.
Peter, no, please.
No, Peter, don't.
Please, please?
-Stop him, please.
-Get off!
Please...
Help me, please.
I just heard about the boys.
Talk to Peter,
please. He's sick.
He knows about Rosa.
He'll do something terrible.
Where have they gone?
To the circus?
Come on!
Come on.
Shoot, man, shoot!
We must kill them all.
Kill it! Kill it, man!
They were gonna take
my daughter, my little girl.
-No, I won't let you.
-Pa, no! Papa, no, no!
Slut! Slut, you're
trying to save him!
No!
Rosa!
What is it? What's happened?
It's his heart. He's dead.
So are all my animals.
What have you come to do to us?
Don't you know?
Emil?
Emil?
Emil.
Drink the blood, cousin.
Drink deep.
Live, my love, live.
I have done as Emil told me.
We have revenged you,
taken their children
to give you life.
Tonight, your twins
will kill Mueller's child
and you will live.
Emil?
Tonight!
Our show must be brief tonight,
but for all who are
willing to pay the price,
we invite you to go
through the Mirror of Life.
No, no.
Dora Mueller.
Dora Mueller.
Dora Mueller.
Dora Mueller.
Dora!
Dora?
Dora!
Dora?
Dora?
Dora!
Dora!
Dora!
It must be tonight!
But she wears the cross.
Your mother will be with you,
to tear it from her
daughter's neck.
We will do what must
be done, Peter, I swear it.
And Rosa?
I don't know.
-Leave us.
-Yes, Doctor.
I wish...
If only I'd returned sooner.
A virulent strain of
rabies carried by bats.
My test proved it.
The emperor himself saw
that I had everything we need
and provided me with these
soldiers to get me back safely.
Tell them the rest.
I mocked at talk of vampires
and the baron's curse.
I was wrong.
I've seen proof,
terrifying proof.
People have been killed
in towns and villages,
killed by vampires.
And each place where a
victim has been reported,
the Circus of Nights have stayed
for a day or two, then moved on.
They've been here
for a week. Why?
One of them, the
one called Emil,
is a kinsmen of
Count Mitterhaus.
We have two plagues to fight.
We must distribute
the medicines to the ill.
And rid ourselves of
this second sickness,
for good.
Whatever it was, you're
safe here in your own home.
I keep feeling it's
important for me
to remember what happened.
Do you know where
the key to this door is?
Anton,
I see myself
near the castle.
No!
No, no, under the castle.
No. Oh, no, I can't remember.
I must remember.
God bless you for this help.
-How many are sick?
-Two.
It's got something
to do with the twins.
Twins, they were
leaving. Then...
God damn them!
What's that?
It's only the boarding
students upstairs.
I'm getting so jumpy,
you'll have to protect me.
Well, what from?
What from?
The students, upstairs.
No, stay there!
Now, let me in or
I'll break it down!
Now, let me in!
What's happening in there?
Open the--
What's happening? Let me in!
Anton?
Anton?
Anton!
Anton!
Anton!
Anton! Anton!
Louder.
Louder, no one can hear.
No.
Helga!
My children! My children!
Oh, no. Look what you did!
In the school chapel, quickly!
Dora.
-Stay here and distribute the medicine.
-Right.
Dora, it's all right.
Are you all right?
Thank God you are.
The students upstairs,
they're all dead.
Kersh? Dr. Kersh?
I didn't think she'd
let them harm you.
Why? Who is she?
Who is she?
Someone who should
have died 15 years ago.
All the bodies have
been torn to pieces.
We have to get back to the
village, will you be all right?
Gerta, stay with her.
Here, take this.
Don't worry.
Lock and bar the doors behind us
and close the
shutters, all right?
Come, Anton, we must
finish it before dawn
or they'll escape.
We must finish it before dawn.
Take no chances.
Stay together.
Be constantly on guard and
remember how many there are.
Not all of them are vampires,
but all of them are dangerous.
The dancers, the
strongman, and the dwarf,
Emil, and the gypsy.
-And the Count.
-What?
And your children will
die to bring me back to life.
That's why they've
remained here for so long.
Don't you understand that?
The Count, back from the dead.
In the name of Jesus, leave us!
Leave us!
Please leave us.
Please leave us alone.
Please.
Go back to them.
Anna,
damn you!
Go back to the caravans,
find Michael and bring him here.
Doctor! Doctor, over here!
It's the dancers.
Human beings bled like
animals to feed the vampires.
We must find the others!
We must destroy the circus.
Burn them out!
-Hold fast or I'll fire!
-Wait!
Show us where they
are and we'll spare you.
Show us!
None of you will live.
The town of Stetl will die.
And you will die.
Daughter!
The crypt!
The noises I heard
came from here.
Start digging, quickly.
Aha!
No!
Dora!
Get away, Anton! Get away!
Thank the lord that
you have been saved.
