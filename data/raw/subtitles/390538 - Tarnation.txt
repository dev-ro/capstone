'Cause I went on the internet

Yeah.
Yeah, we could leave--
I could run a key over

I feel like I'm gonna

Yeah, I'm really--
I'm sick on top of it,

I've got, like, a 102 fever.

If you compare
yourself with others,

Enjoy your achievements as
well as your.
Keep interested in
your own career,
however humble.

This is like a, um,
testimony, isn't it?
Jimmy says when I
wear too much makeup,
it makes me look
like a whore, so...
sorry.
Hi.
Oh, I told you my name.
Um...
my testimony is about, um,
me and my little baby...
Caroline.
I've b-- I've been through hell.
I'm kind of nervous
here in front of you all.
What a year, you know?
1969.
Just...
housewife for me.
Um, it all s--
started when, um...
Jim-- Jimmy was
coming home late at night.
He was getting-- you
know, getting into,
um, alcohol.
And I-- I was...pregnant
with Caroline and...
still gaining the pounds.
She's only-- she's
two years old now.
Healthy baby.
Um...
s-- she-- he used to beat me...
when he'd come
home drunk at night.
He used to beat me.
And...
he used to, um...
he...kicked me in the
stomach while I was pregnant.
And, um...
he'd tie me up...
when he was smoking that dope.
That's what got to
him...in the brain there.
And, um...
This is really, um...
hard for me.
One night, he got out the gun.
I was tied up on the bed.
And he came and
pointed it to my head.
He said, "I'll
kill you, bitch.
I'll kill you!"
It was the other way around.
I-- I...
I got out the gun one night.
Blew his ass away.
That's it.
That's it.

Nobody else hears it, but I do.
And I've been-- I've-- I've

I don't-- I don't even like
to suck on stuff like that.
I just have the
feelings of doing it.
I don't like to do it.
Seriously, I don't.
I love my mother so much.

I was an extremely abused child.
It was a-- an ongoing thing.
There was no end to it.
I never knew from one minute to
the next when I was gonna be hit
or slapped or drug by my hair...
by my-- the
people who raised me.
Sick parents
raise sick children.
My children are
Jonathan and David,
and they are very
special, wonderful children.
When I was a little girl,
the mother who raised me...
would chase me through the
house with a belt in her
hand, and I would run to my
bed and lie on my stomach,
and she would
whip me on my back.
Rosemary was the
woman who raised me.
She was...
schizophrenic, she
was very neurotic,
and she was very psychotic.
She would hit me on
my back, she would...
hit me with her fist
for no apparent reason.
I was extremely
abused and, uh...
hopefully, I-- I didn't bring
over any of the abuse to my
children.
I wanted to be the
one to break the cycle.

-Nothing.

recycle these stories to me all
the time about Rosemary and
Adolph and your doctors and how
fucked up they fucked you up.
-Your father i--
of course is Steve,
and he was a very good provider
for us when he was married,
when I was married to him.
And, um, had a
beautiful apartment home,
had the finest
furniture and the best food.
And he was a good, loyal friend
and husband to me for the length
of time that we were married.
Um...
How
did you guys meet?
Oh, my God.

too.

Hello, Jonathan.
Adolph's going to
have me committed.
I can't take it anymore.
Adolph screams and
yells at me every day.
I can't stand this.
Hello, honey?
Listen, please call
your mom tonight.
It's-- it's
definitely an emergency.
Jonathan, please call me!
I think Adolph's gonna put me
in the hospital to make it look
like I'm the one
that needs the help.
They'll come to my door and
put handcuffs on me and put me
inside of a car and
carry me to God-knows-where.
Let me tell you, Jonathan, there
should be a law against this.
This is a call of desperation.
I take Lithium like a good girl,
but there's nothing wrong with
me.
Let me tell you, Jonathan,
I'm getting out of Texas,
and I'm...
I'm coming to live with you.

if she would have not had to
deal with anything like this.
-Well, she-- she--
Any illnesses.
-She's normal, she gets
depressed once in a while.
She gets delusional.
She tells me that you and
Grandma used to lock her in
closets.
-No.
That you would just
lock her in closets and abuse
her and...
she's even told
me things like...
horrible things, Dad.
Like your mother used to molest
her and touch her on her vagina.
And she thinks that
you're not her real parents.
-Sometimes, she thinks
Elizabeth Taylor was her mother.
That
Elizabeth Taylor was?
Do you know what
she also told me?
That she was born
with four nipples.
And that she was also
born a hermaphrodite.
A boy.
She either is delusional and she
completely believes what she's
saying or there's
maybe some truth to this.
-We've got a happy family and
a wonderful family and we love
God.
I know things a little more
deeper than-- than you do.
-Dad, the world is
a hateful place.
-No...
-Yes, it is, Dad.
Do you think this
family has been a government
experiment?
-Yes, it has been.
-I-- I-- I don't know what--
your fucking
memory is shot to hell!
Now, honey--
-You can't remember
shit in your own life--
-You're too pretty
to talk like that.
-Fuck you!
Dad, did you
ever lock Renee up in closets?
-No.
-Jonathan, don't
bring that up, damn you!
-No, I--
-Adolph, don't bring that up.
Jonathan, damn you.
Stop it!
-I'm out of it.
Just-- I-- I--
Why are
you so angry with me?
-The questions you
ask me and all of that,
there's nothing the
matter with-- with me.
You're trying to-- you're trying
to scheme something on me.
I'm not trying
to scheme anything on you!
-Just leave me alone and
you tend to your business!
You understand?
I'm not trying
to scheme anything on you.
-Well, just leave me alone!
Police department, please.
I'm on the phone.
-Adolph, are you insane?
-No, I want to call--
-Yes, you are!
I want to talk to.
You can come over to my house.
here is acting
up and I want you to....
Take that away!
Take that away!
He's photographing--
-No, I don't want to
be photographed by him!
-More like yourself.
-Can you see?
-Yeah.
Can I get my
New York ID tomorrow?
-Yeah, what time do
you need to get there?
-Okay.
You've gotta wake me up in
the morning because I'm off my
sleeping schedule right now.
-What?
-Oh, I know.
-Filming on the toilet?
-It's like five in the morning
and I wanted this scene to kind
of be in the dark like it was
when I was younger with the
light and...
the sun's about to come up, so
I have to hurry up and do this.
My mother's up right now.
She's-- she has insomnia.
She's-- she's off
her sleeping schedule.
She's downstairs right now.
She's just...
turning the sink on,
so I'm-- I'm really...
I'm scared of
letting myself go to,
uh...
talk about anything right now.
I don't know...
if it's just because
I'm a grown-up now, um...
that people tell me things
like "Why do you look so
worried?"
Or...
"Why do you have
such stress in your face?"
Or "How come you can't
get a sentence out now?"
Or "What the hell
is wrong with you?"
We sat through Neil Simon's
Seems Like Old Times with
Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase
like three times in a row.
That was back in the days
when like people could do that.
You could just like sit through
a movie over and over again.
Oh, fucking shit.
I don't ever want to
turn out like my mother.
And I'm scared 'cause...
um...
when I was little and she
was my age that I am now,
which is 31, um...
she seemed a lot
better than she does now.
I love my mother so much.
As fucked up as it is...
I can't escape her.
She lives inside me.
She's in my hair,
she's behind my eyes.
She's under my skin.
She's...
downstairs.
Uh, I can't do this.
Here, sweetie.
Take this.
I love you.
...But do not distress
yourself with imagining.
Many fears are born of
fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a discipline,
be gentle with yourself.
You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the
stars.
You have a right to be here.
And whether or not
it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is
unfolding as it should.
Therefore, be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive him to be,
and whatever your labors
and aspirations in the noisy
confusion of life, keep
peace with your soul.
With all its
, drudgery,
and broken dreams, it is
still a beautiful world.
