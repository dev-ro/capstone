Jojo Betzler.
Ten years old.
Today, you join the ranks of the Jungvolk
in a very special training weekend.
It's going to be intense.
But today, you become a man.
I swear to devote
all my energies and my strength
to the savior of our country,
Adolf Hitler.
I am willing and ready
to give up my life for him.
80 help me God.
Yes, that's right.
- Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?
- Snake mind.
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your body?
- Wolf body.
- Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?
- Panther courage.
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?
- A German soul.
Yeah, man. You're ready.
- Adolf.
- Hmm?
I don't think I can do this.
Was? Of course you can.
Sure, you're a little bit scrawny
and a bit unpopular
and you can't tie your Shoelaces
even though you're ten years old.
But you're still the bestest,
most loyal little Nazi I've ever met.
Not to mention the fact
you're really good looking.
So, you're gonna get out there
and you're gonna have a great time, okay?
- Okay.
- That's the spirit. Okay.
Heil me, man.
Heil Hitler.
What? You can heil me better than that.
- Heil Hitler.
- No...
Just throw it away.
Don't even think about it.
- Heil Hitler.
- No, you're overthinking it.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil "Hitterler."
Who's "Hitterler?"
Do you even speak German?
- Heil Hitler.
- That's not a heil. This is a heil. Heil!
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.
Ooh, that's it.
You've got it. Heil Hitler.
- Have a great day! Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
- You're gonna be the best. Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
- You can do it.
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler!

Heil Hitler, guys.
Heil Hitler!
Jungvolk, welcome to
the Hitlerjugend training weekend.
In which we will make men
and women of you all.
My name is Captain Klenzendorf.
You may call me Captain K.
Captain K. Whoo!
Ja. And this is Sub-Officer Finkel.
This is Fräulein Rahm.
Hey. Heil Hitler, everyone.
So a little about me. Who am I?
And why am I here talking to a bunch
of little titty-grabbers
instead of leading my men
into battle towards glorious death?
Great question.
I've asked it myself every day
since Operation Screw Up
where I lost a perfectly good eye
in a totally preventable enemy attack.
And according to my superiors,
you need two eyes to be
a meaningful part of the war effort.
Can two-eyed people do this?
- Jesus.
- Over the next two days,
you little critters will get to experience
some of the things
that the mighty German army
goes through every day.
And even though it would appear
our country's on the back foot
and there really isn't much hope
in us winning this war,
apparently we're doing just fine.
Anyway. You boys have all been issued
with your Deutsches Jungvolk daggers.
These are very special
and expensive weapons.
You should never be without them.
And don't try to stab each other.
No stabbing!
No stabbing.
This is your first step towards being men.
Today you boys will be involved
in such activities
as marching, bayonet drills,
grenade-throwing,
trench-digging, map-reading, gas defense,
camouflage, ambush techniques,
war games, firing guns,
and blowing stuff up.
The girls will practice
important womanly duties
such as dressing wounds, making beds,
and learning how to get pregnant.
Aw.
I've had 18 kids for Germany.
Such a great year to be a girl.
All right. Let's get to it.
Come on.
Go!
God help me.

Jews sound scary, huh?
Not to me.
If I met one, I'd kill it like that.
Like... that.
But how would you know if you saw one?
They could look just like us.
I'd feel its head for horns.
And they smell like brussels sprouts.
Oh, yeah. I forgot about
the brussels sprouts bit.
Imagine catching one
and giving it to Hitler.
That'd be a surefire way
to get into his personal guards.
Then we would become best friends.
I thought I was your best friend.
Yorki, you're my second-best friend.
First place is reserved for the Führer.
So, unless you're Hitler hiding in a fat,
little boy's body...
I'd be happy with second place.
I guess I'm just a kid
in a fat kid's body.
Case closed.
Raah! Raah! Raah!
When you stand before the enemy
and have to end his life,
which of you will have
the stomach to do this?
Good.
There is no room in Hitler's army
for those that lack strength.
We want hardened warriors.
Those that are prepared to kill at will.
Can you do this?
- Yes.
- Ja
Johannes.
Can you kill?
Pfff. Of course. I love killing.
Good. Come here.
Don't be scared. Come on.
Good.
Kill it.
Huh?
Wring its neck and kill the rabbit.
Or are you scared?
I'm not scared. I... I just...
Now.
Place both hands around its neck
and then one hard twist.
He might scream, but we'll just use
the boot to finish it off.
Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.
- Shoo! Come on, shoo.
- Hey! Hey, hey.
Good shot.
You are a coward.
Just like your father.
He... He's not a coward.
- He's fighting in Italy.
- Really?
But no one has heard
from him in two years.
He is a deserting coward.
He's scared and so are you.
You're as scared as a little rabbit.
Scared little rabbit.
Maybe we should snap your neck, too?
Jojo the rabbit.
Jojo Rabbit.
Jojo Rabbit.
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.
Poor Jojo. What's wrong, little man?
- Hi, Adolf.
- Wanna tell me about that rabbit incident?
What was all that about?
They wanted me to kill it.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Don't worry about it.
I couldn't care less.
But now they call me a scared rabbit.
Let them say whatever they want.
People used to say a lot
of nasty things about me.
"Oh, this guy's a lunatic."
"Oh, look at that psycho.
He's gonna get us all killed."
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
The rabbit is no coward.
The humble little bunny faces
a dangerous world every day,
hunting carrots for his family,
for his country.
My empire will be full of all animals.
Lions, giraffes, zebras,
rhinoceroses, octopuses,
rhinoctopuses.
Even the mighty rabbit.
Cigarette?
Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.
Let me give you some really good advice.
Be the rabbit.
The humble bunny
can outwit all of his enemies.
He's brave and sneaky and strong.
Be the rabbit.
Jojo!
Are you all right, Jojo?
Who were you talking to?
Nobody.
Oh, I thought you were crying.
Are you a teardrop specialist?
No.
Case closed.
Now, it's time for Jojo
to show those stick insects
who is the real cowardly rabbit.
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?
Never mind.
Jojo, where are you going?
To be the rabbit!
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.
Hunting carrots. Jojo Rabbit.
Hey, this is amazing.
We're like two human antelopes.
Now, lads, each of you
will be given the opportunity
to ignite and throw a grenade.
I will personally
be supervising each of you
to make sure you don't blow
your eyes out or something.
All right, who's first?

Hey, kid.
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
Mmm. My darling little cub.
Why so happy?
Your son is ugly like a monster.
Hey. You're no monster.
Besides, your scars will heal,
and you'll get most
of the movement back in your leg.
But I'll never be
in Hitler's personal guards.
Ah, you're fine as you are.
I'm just happy to have you back home. Hmm?
Mama Lion worries about her cub,
especially when Papa Lion isn't here.
Or Inge Lion.
Or Inge Lion.
You grab the rabbit by the tail,
wrap it around his ear,
tie it all up and then
stuff him back down the hole.
Now then, let's get on our way, huh?
I think getting out of the house
will do wonders for your recuperation.
I don't want to go out there.
What? Don't be silly. Of course you do.
I look stupid.
People will stare.
Enjoy the attention, kid.
Not everyone's
lucky enough to look stupid.
I, for one, am cursed
to look incredibly attractive.
Now, you're going
to pluck up your courage,
walk out that door, and have
an incredible adventure.
Okay?
Okay.
Field Marshal Jojo, you're our top man.
Prepare to leave the house.
Is it dangerous?
Extremely.
- Heil Hitler.
- Oh, Jesus.
Hey!
- Looking good, kid.
- Heil Hitler!
Frau Betzler,
you're looking fetching as usual.
Okay, wow.
It's because of you
my son can't walk properly
and has a messed-up face.
He stole my hand grenade.
- Just took it...
- Ja, ja.
So, you are going to look after him
while I'm at work, hmm?
Make sure he has a job
and feels included. Got it?
Got it. Ja, I really got it.
Good.
Guys, this is Johannes Betzler.
The kid I told you about.
Remember, he stole a hand grenade
and blew himself up and as a result
I got demoted for negligence.
Now I get to work in this office
with all these wonderful kids.
So, Jojo. I'm sure we can figure out
something for you to do.
- Oh!
- Ideas?
- Ja.
- Guys?
Ja. Ja.
Okay, well, we need somebody
to walk the clones.
Also, I think maybe he could hand out
this new propaganda
and deliver these conscriptions.
I don't suppose
I could be conscripted?
Could I?
Oh, yes, that's a wonderful idea.
Yes, I give my full permission
for you to send
this ten-year-old child into war.
Will someone get this kid a gun?
And I'd be more than happy
to fight in the front.
Get in line, kid.
Okay. Here are the conscriptions,
and here is a gun.
Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
It's a bit... for the gun?
No.

I'm something worse,

know that, don't you?
You know what I am.
- Yes.
Say it.
Say it!
A Jew.
Gesundheit.
You can't be here.
Well, your mother invited me,
so I suppose that makes me her guest.
- It's not allowed.
- What will you do, sweet Hitlerchen?
Hmm?
Of course.
Go on, then. Tell them.
But do you know what happens if you do?
I'll tell them you helped me.
And your mother, too.
Then we'll all be kaputt.
And if you tell her you know
about me, just one word...
I'll do the world a great, big favor
and cut your Nazi head off.
Got it?
Ja.
I think I'll hold onto this. It's pretty.
Sheesh. That was intense.
- What am I going to do?
- Honestly, no idea.
I mean, there could be more of them.
Hundreds of them living in your walls.
How did she get control like that?
She must've used her powers.
Mind control.
Oh, typical.
- Did you see how fast she moved?
- Yes.
Like a little, female Jewish Jesse Owens.
- And now she's got your fancy knife.

Yeah. Like a little, female
Jewish Jesse Owens,
Jack the Ripper.
You're definitely in a pickle, my friend.
Ah, what to do, what to do?
- Oh. Got it!
- Got it!
- I will negotiate.
- Burn down the house
and blame Winston Churchill.
Or negotiate. Hmm.
Excuse me?
Little girl?
Um... Jew girl in the wall?
Yoo-hoo. Jew?
Okay, well, I'll just say
what I have to say and that's this:
I'm not scared of you
and I think you should find
somewhere else to live.
Okay?
Not okay.
Get the hell out of my room.
She's pretty rude, you know.
That's just my two Pfennige.
- And now she's got two knives.
- I know!
- How are you going to chop up stuff?
- I don't know!
Oh, and she's still up there, too.
That... that thing, that, that...
- Jew.
- Yeah. Jew, yeah.
- What are we gonna do about that Jew?
- You think of something.
Oh, now I'm the expert?
Stop offering me
damned cigarettes! I'm ten!
All right. Sorry. I'm stressed out!
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.
You can't tell your mother
or that Jew will cutoff your Nazi head,
but there's no reason this thing
in the attic needs to ruin your life.
In fact, you could use it
to your advantage.
How?
When someone tries to use
mind powers on me,
know what I do?
Use mind powers back on them.
Remember last year
when that one-arm pirate von Stauffenberg
tried to blow me up with a table bomb?
Yeah, you survived.
Correctomundo.
The only reason I survived,
apart from having bombproof legs,
is because I outwitted old von Stauffy.
I let him think that I was dead, when
in actual fact, I was absolutely fine.
By pretending I was dead,
I drew out all the traitors.
So what are you going to do?
Pretend I'm dead?
Exactly. Wait, no.
No, what I mean is this:
make her feel safe
and then she'll drop her guard
and then you will be the one in control.
- Reverse psychology.
- Don't complicate things.
Just use my backwards mind power trick,
and everything will be fine.
Ooh! I got to go.
We're having unicorn for dinner
at my place tonight.
Concentrate, Jojo.
Remember, a Jew living in your wall
is better than two Jews flying around
with their bat wings
climbing down chimneys
and eating innocent Nazis.
And don't give her any more knives.
Tschüss.
Darling cub, why are you up, huh?
Did you eat anything, hmm?
Sorry, I lost track of time.
I was taking a long walk
and having a thing...
What are we going to do

You'll learn how to tie them
eventually, no?
- I heard her.

Oh. That's so sad for you.
You've lost your mind.
It's sadder for me, though, because I have

I heard noises. Upstairs.
Ghosts? Honestly.
You know what I heard? Rats.
Yes, we have them. Can you believe that?
Dirty animals.
I've been meaning to tell you

I'm being made to teach the HJ boys
water warfare training.
You know, in case they ever need
to go to battle in a swimming pool.
Can I ask you a question about Jews?
Oh, God. Why?
What should I do if I see one?
Ugh. Okay.
If you see a Jew, you tell us,
we tell the Gestapo, and they tell the SS,
and then they go and they kill the Jew.
And anyone who helped the Jew.
And because these are very paranoid times,
probably some other people just in case.
It's a pretty drawn out process.
Even if the Jew hypnotized someone
to make them hide
the Jew in the first place?
I'd be amazed if that could happen.
No, it can happen.
It happened to my uncle.
A Jew hypnotized him
and he became
a massive drunk and a gambler.
And he cheated on his wife
and he had an inappropriate
relationship with my sister.
And then he drowned
in an unrelated accident,
but it was the Jew's fault.
Anyway. Did you see one? A Jew.
I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if I did.
Yeah, me neither.
Without their funny hats,
it's damn near impossible.
Someone should write a book
on the subject.
It would make things
so much easier.
- It would be a hit.
- Ja.
Finkie, they're drowning. Come on.
I'll see you later, little man.
♪♪
Okay, here's the situation.
If I tell on you,
you'll be in big trouble,
and I don't think you want that.
But then you'll tell on me and my mother,
and we'll be in trouble,
which I don't want.
And if you tell my mother I know,
then she'll kick you out,
which you don't want.
And if I tell my mother I know,
then you'll cutoff my Nazi head,
which I also don't want.
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.
It's just a normal stalemate.
I have some conditions
for allowing you to stay here.
- "Conditions?"
- Yes.
Tell me everything about the Jewish race.
Okay.
We're like you,
but human.
Please take this seriously.
Think of this as an exposé.
I want to know all your secrets.
Kindly refrain from sitting

Why? She doesn't need it.
You know nothing of my sister.
Inge and I were friends.
I remember you.
Such a funny little boy.
Pfft. Enough with the small talk.
Start telling me about your kind.
Obviously, we are demons who love money.
Right?
Obviously. Everyone knows that.
But what people don't know
is that we're also allergic to food.
Cheese, bread, meat.
That stuff will kill us instantly.
So, if you're thinking of ending my life,
that's the fastest way.
Also biscuits, lethal.
Very funny.
Anyway, there's not enough food for you,
so I don't know what you're going to do.
Your mother managed to find me some bread.
She's kind. She treats me like a person.
But you're not. Not a proper person.
Are you?
How dare you, Jew!
You are weak like an eyelash.
I am born of Aryan ancestry.
My blood is the color of a pure red rose.
And my eyes are blue like...
Break free.
Break free, great Aryan.
There are no weak Jews.
I am descended from those
who wrestle angels and kill giants.
We were chosen by God.
You were chosen by a pathetic little man

France will be next
and soon the war will be over.
Goddamn it! Why does that make you happy?
You hate your country that much?
I love my country. It's the war I hate.
It's pointless and stupid,
and the sooner we have peace, the better.
Oh, the war will end.
We will crush our enemies into dust.
And when they are destroyed,
we shall use their graves as toilets.

Yes, Dad.
Thanks.

Who's Rilke?
A great poet. Nathan's favorite.
Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yay.
He's coming to rescue me,
then we'll go live in Paris.
You'd turn your back on Germany forever?
It turned on me first.
Well, we don't need you.
You and your stupid boyfriend can shut up
and go live in damn
cheese, snail, baguette land.
Now, now, just because
you don't have a girlfriend.
I'm way too busy for a girlfriend.
One day, you'll make time.
You'll think of nothing else.
You'll meet someone and spend your days
dreaming of the moment

That's love.
- Ridiculous.
- Finished.

I came across an old letter from Nathan,
your fiancé, addressed to you.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'll just read it.
"Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say,
"but don't want to marry you anymore.
"I found a new woman and we laugh a lot
"and do the tongue-kiss.
"It's like my favorite poet, Rilke, says,
"'We need in love to practice only this:
letting each other go.'
"So, goodbye and sorry
about letting you go.
"From Nathan, your ex-fiancé.
"PS, I'm not really in the resistance.
"I was lying.
I'm unemployed and quite fat now."
Um... don't open the door,
but I actually forgot
there was a second letter.
"Dear Elsa..."
"I just wanted to let you know that
I don't want to break up with you now.
"I changed my mind because I don't
want you to kill yourself over me,
"which a couple of girls
have done in the past,
"and it's pretty stressful.
"I need you to stay alive.
"Thank God you're being
taken care of by that kid
"who I must say is a remarkable young man
beyond his years.
"And brave, too.
"And let's still get married sometime,
"even though I am truly unemployed
"and have nothing going on for me.
Yours, Nathan."

No, you idiot.

You may continue, but I know it's true.
The penis thing.
Rabbis use them for earplugs.

After many years

Their heads are too thick

And we're also attracted to shiny things.
Crystals, glass, and gold.
"Attracted to shiny things."

You love them, yes?
Ugly things.

More dead people in my house, please.
Look, just all the time
you two are spending together,

You suggested it in the first place.
Did I?
- Yeah.

a good time to be a Nazi.
Hey. So now the war's over,
at least your girlfriend will be free.
She can leave now.
Something wrong?
I've got to go.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
Later!

Hi. I'm home.
What's going on out there?
- Out where?
- Outside, dummy.
Jojo, what's going on?
Is it safe to come out?
Jojo, is it safe?
Can I leave?
No.
You can't leave.
Why?
You have to stay here...
Who won?
...with me.
Jojo, who won... who won the war?
We did.
Germany won the war.
I-I'm sorry.

Nathan."

- Pardon?
Nathan.
He died last year.
Tuberculosis.
Well... that's weird.
Who wrote these?
Thank you, Jojo.
You have been so good to me.
Well, the thing is, I love you.
I know you think of me
as a younger brother, which is fine,
and, um, you're too old anyway.
But...
Man, it's quite hot in here.
I love you, too.
- As a younger brother.
- As a younger brother.
Look, me and fake Nathan have found
a way for you to escape.
Maybe you can trust a younger brother?
Maybe.
Okay, then.
Get your things together.
We're leaving.
Jojo Betzler.
Ten and a half years old.
Today,
just do what you can.
Where in the shit do you think
you're going, hmm?
- Out.
- Out? Oh, no, you don't.
No, we're gonna stay in here
and you're gonna tell me
exactly what's going on
with you and that thing in the attic.
That "thing" is a girl.
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- Yes.
- Admit it.
- I just said yes.
I knew it!
Well, it's never gonna work out.
No. No, she's too old for you.
And you're ugly.
You know she's gonna leave you.
You know that, don't you?
So, here's what's
gonna happen, you little shit.
You're gonna put this on, okay?
You're gonna forget about
that disgusting Jewy cow up there.
And you're gonna come back
to me, where you belong.
Right?
Put it on.
And then, we're gonna pretend
none of this ever happened.
You got it?
You're not gonna heil me?
Come on? For old time's sake?
- Heil me, little man.
- No.
- Heil me.
- No.
Give me a little heil.
Just a little heil. Please?
Fuck off, Hitler.
Come on.
