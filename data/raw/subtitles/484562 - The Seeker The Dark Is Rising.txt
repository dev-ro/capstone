-How about your dear oId mom, eh?
[MOTHER HISSES]
Your time wiII come.
''Here Iie the remains of. . .
. . .Thomas Stanton. ''
Stanton, Tom.
GREYTHORNE: He's buried
in the crypt beIow the church.
An ancestor, perhaps.
-My ancestor was an OId One?
-Oh, not onIy that, WiII.
He was a craftsman.
MERRIMAN:
In a time...
...of great danger,
when the Dark threatened...
...he made the Signs in secret,
even from us.
He told us that five
were made of common substance.
And the sixth Sign?
Stanton said it couId never be found
because it was never hidden.
Then how am I supposed to find it?
You're the Seeker. You're our guide.
OnIy you can interpret the meaning.
A souI freeIy given to unIeash
the power of the Light.
His own?
Stanton, he made a choice, WiII.
His famiIy. . .
. . .fIed from the Dark,
across the Iand. . .
. . .and his descendants,
across the water.
UntiI one day. . .
-. . .they returned.
MARY: I don't see any dates.
Oh, so, there's no way of knowing,
is there?
It couId be nothing to do with us,
right?
-I mean, just coincidence.
-Right.
Yes, of course. Coincidence.
WeII, Merry Christmas.
Yes. Merry Christmas to you.
Miss Greythorne is
a generous supporter of the coIIege.
You fixed a job for my dad?
Destiny brought you here, WiII.
We just took care of the detaiIs.
RIDER: My power increases by the day
and in three, I reach my peak.
But the Seeker has two Signs now
and with each, his strength aIso grows.
My offer is true.
Work fast, bring me what I want. . .
. . .and then you shaII
reap your reward.
JOHN:
Best one yet.
MARY: Thank you, sweetheart.
It was good, wasn't it?
JOHN:
Oh, I'm stuffed.
MARY: I am so fuII.
And we've got Iots of turkey Ieftovers.
-Fantastic for sandwiches.
JOHN: Good, sandwiches.
MARY: Hi, guys.
JAMES: Hey. Um. . . .
MARY: Hi.
-Everyone, this is Maggie.
-Maggie, everyone.
MAGGIE: Hi.
JOHN: Hi, Maggie.
MARY: How you doing?
Can I heIp with anything?
MARY: No, we're fine, reaIIy.
Don't worry about it.
We're just stopping for a minute,
then we're gonna run--
-James, come on, heIp your mom.
JAMES: What?
MARY:
That's right, James. HeIp your mom.
JAMES: Thanks.
MARY: Yeah. Come on over.
[BLOWING ]
Are you an OId One?
Do I Iook Iike an OId One?
No, no! I just. . . . OIder.
I'm just here to Iook out for you.
Okay?
Brr. Catch your death out here.
-Can I heIp you?
-Yes, Max, I think you can.
Very good.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
I can do much more.
[WHISPERS]
I have powers.
Come here.
So you and James, are you guys. . .?
-Are you guys, Iike, um. . .?
-What?
-Friends?
-Yes. I Iike your brother.
I mean, ''boyfriend-girIfriend'' friends.
WiII, aren't there more important things
for you to be thinking about right now?
It's important to me.
I've been thinking about you--
I just. . . . I feIt Iike we were connected.
Hey, where you been?
Waiting for you,
and hanging with your IittIe brother.
So sweet.
Let's go.
Yeah.
''Sweet. '' Aw.
Can we taIk?
I've spent my Iife being WiII Stanton,
a sociaI inadequate.
Most of the time I'm just invisibIe.
Then you come aIong and teII me
I'm speciaI and that I've got powers.
So I'm Iike, ''Great, now Iife's
gonna be better now, right?''
No. No, it's not.
I am no superhero.
I'm stiII me.
You are the Seeker, WiII.
The future of the human race
rests on you. Don't you understand this?
Look, I'm supposed to save the worId?
Okay, I can't even figure out
how to taIk to a girI.
Don't Iet a girI distract you.
You've got work to do.
There are onIy three days Ieft. Go on.
-Fine.
-Go on!
-Three days, WiII.
-I got it.
[SCREAMING ]
Miss Greythorne. Look.
What is he doing? Hm?
[WILL SCREAMS]
Expressing himseIf.
MERRIMAN: Doesn't he know
he'II exhaust his powers?
You are not without
your own Iessons to Iearn, Merriman.
He came to you, not for more warnings.
He needed you simpIy to Iisten.
[SCREAMS]
WiII?
Gwen, what are you doing here?
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
[THUNDER RUMBLING ]
What?
Stay cIose.
[MEN YELLING ]
What happened?
-We stepped through time.
-What?
Gwen, go!
[KITTEN MEWS]
Gwen! Gwen, get down. Get down.
[MAN SCREAMS]
There it is.
Shh. Shh. You're okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I need to get that shieId, Gwen. It's
the onIy way we'II get home. Trust me.
[HORN BLOWING ]
Be quiet. It's okay.
Stay there. It's okay.
[KITTEN MEWING ]
[MAN GRUNTING ]
[WILL YELLING ]
WiII!
[GWEN SCREAMS]
WILL:
Leave her aIone!
WiII!
[WATCH BEEPING ]
Okay. You want the watch?
Yeah? Yeah?
AII right. Trade? AII right.
Watch for the shieId. Okay?
AII right.
Gwen, we got it.
We got it!
MERRIMAN:
WiII! I warned you!
Gwen, go home. I'II catch up.
Don't teII anybody about this, okay?
Okay, go home. Go.
You exhausted your powers.
You couId have been kiIIed.
I got the Sign, didn't I? On my own.
I didn't see any of you heIping.
You were seIfish and irresponsibIe.
Every day, the Dark is tightening its grip.
-OnIy you stand in its way.
-Yeah. Yeah, you keep teIIing me.
WiII, WiII, WiII, pIease!
AII right, I'm sorry. If you wish. . .
. . .to express yourseIf,
I'm sure that I can Iisten.
It's so-- You know, and I'm Iike--
The whoIe thing's just, uhn!
You know?
Is that it?
-Yeah.
-Miss Greythorne said this is. . . .
This is naturaI for someone your age.
What if I can't do this?
Trust that you can.
Even the smaIIest Iight
shines in the darkness.
Go on.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
RIDER:
The height of my power approaches. . .
. . .yet stiII the boy coIIects,
and now hoIds three Signs.
You know what you must do.
But understand. . .
. . .you are not the onIy one
that I've enIisted.
So deIiver on your promise
or I shaII deIiver on mine.
[HORSE NEIGHING ]
Seeker!
Witness my wrath!
[CROWS CAWING ]
[WIND HOWLING ]
GREYTHORNE:
Our Seeker has very IittIe time. . .
. . .perhaps not enough.
MAN 1 : Throw it on the back.
MAN 2: Leave it.
[SIREN WAILING ]
They're compIeteIy out of food!
There's none Ieft!
We're gonna have to eat
whatever Mom's got in the freezer.
Come on.
-Max, you aII right?
-You know, about your room. . .
. . .it'II be more than a coupIe weeks.
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Whatever.
MAX [IN DISTORTED VOICE] :
''Whatever''?
I'm sick and tired of your attitude.
Saying things behind my back,
turning everyone against me. . .
. . .you think I don't see that?
Max. Max, what's going on?
[IN RIDER'S VOICE]
You've got issues, WiII.
You wanna sort them out?
[RINGING ]
[MAX CHUCKLES IN NORMAL VOICE]
WeII, weII. What do we have here, huh?
You sense a Sign?
-Is that what we're doing here, Seeker?

You sense a Sign?
Give me the Signs.
Give me aII the Signs.
I. . .
. . .hate to do this to my own brother. . .
. . .but you're not giving me any choice.
So I'm gonna count to 1 0.

-It doesn't matter about coIIege.
-Two.

-That's why your stuff's in boxes.
-Because you're not going back.

GEORGE: Yeah.
Nice try, Mr. Dawson.
Dragons indeed.
Anyway, it's a shame to Ieave
the oId pIace aII quiet and Ionesome.
RIDER:
Off duty, gentIemen?
Very careIess,
straying out at a time Iike this.
We're here for a wager, Rider.
We'II take you up on yours as weII.

[WIND HOWLING ]
MAN [ON RADIO] : The government
has declared a state of emergency.
Attempts are being made
to deliver essential supplies...
... to the most severely affected areas.
Experts believe the current conditions
will last for at least another week.
You guys, Miss Greythorne
has invited everybody in the viIIage. . .
. . .to come stay at the manor.
They have their own generator there,
their own food, fueI. . .
. . .which is more than we have.
That was the Iast of our soup
heated on the Iast of our gas.
Okay, that's it.
We pack our bags tonight.
-Tomorrow morning, we go.
PAUL: What if the weatherman's wrong?
He is. The storm wiII peak in two days.
That's aII we have.
If it doesn't get better by then. . .
. . .it never wiII.
Um. . . . Just thinking out Ioud.
''The Light and the Dark. '' Were you
working on this when Tom disappeared?
I shouId have been
caring for you boys.
Instead, I was. . . .
My work. WeII, I thought
I was onto something great.
A reveIation.
It was just an obsession, though.
It was Iike I was being. . . .
JOHN: Being pushed to unlock
this darkness. I couldn 't stop it.
And I Iost myseIf.
And worse...
. . .I Iost Tom.
-It was my fauIt.
-Dad.
That wasn't your fauIt.
MARY:
Max, come on!
PAUL:
No, no! Hey! Guys! Guys! No! Hey!
JOHN: Let them go.
They'II be fine. Come on.
MERRIMAN: We have four Signs?
-Yes.
-The other two?
-Look, I'II find them, okay?
WiII, tomorrow is what?
WiII. WiII. Tomorrow is the finaI day.
Yeah, I know.
But even if I find the fifth Sign. . .
. . .I have no idea how to find the sixth.
When I first saw you, I thought,
''No, a boy, not a warrior. ''
I was wrong.
You've come a Iong way. . .
. . .both as the Seeker
and as WiII Stanton.
I beIieve in you, WiII.
You'II find what you need.
-Now, where are we strongest?
-The Great HaII.
-If the Dark reaches its peak, meet there.
-I can't Ieave my famiIy.
The onIy way to heIp your famiIy
is to defeat the Dark. It's our onIy hope.
Where's George?
Our enemy knows no mercy.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
RIDER: Your tricks can onIy deIay.
And you have just trapped yourseIves.
MAN [ON RADIO] : We are currently
experiencing a temporary calm...

Reports from around the world

Arctic winds, bringing more snow...

RIDER:
Now with the darkness comes the coId.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
RIDER:
Give me the Signs, Will.
Give me the Signs, or I will
hurt those who are dear to you.
WILL:

RIDER: Do you want to ever

Give me the Signs and they will live.
Give me the Signs, Will.

RIDER: Now Iet water finish

Stay together.
It's just water.
[ALL SHOUTING ]
WiII!
Come with me. You're not safe here.
You need to give me the Signs.
They're my responsibiIity.
I can handIe them.
-Let me protect them.
-I don't think I can do that.
It's me, WiII.
Maggie.
Do you beIieve what you said?
That we're connected?
Yeah.
I feIt it too.
You need to give me the Signs

You need to trust me.
Do you trust me?
Yeah, I trust you.
RIDER:

With another Sign, he will undo you.
Give me the Signs.

[WILL YELLS]
[ALL SCREAMING ]
RIDER:

MERRIMAN: HoId on!

[POUNDING ]
[RUMBLING ]
The Rider's reached fuII strength. But

[HORSE NEIGHS]
[IN MARY'S VOICE]
Thank you, WiII.
[RIDER GROWLING ]
RIDER [IN NORMAL VOICE] :
Where are your guardians now?
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Have they abandoned their Seeker?
Did you disappoint them, WiII?
A thousand years of waiting
and what was there to show? Nothing!
Nothing but a boy who couId not
do what was asked of him.
Generations of hope and promise,
aII a waste.
I have something here
you might recognize.
Once before I made you an offer, WiII.
Now here it is again.
Give me the Signs
and the boy wiII Iive.
WILL:
I'm not afraid to die.
I'm not afraid to die!
RIDER:
Who says it's you?
-Tom?
RIDER: Yes.
Poor IittIe Tom.
The wrong twin.
My prisoner these Iast 1 4 years.
Imagine how he's missed
his dear twin brother.
MERRIMAN:
Resist him, WiII! You're WiII Stanton.
You are the Seeker.
RIDER: Give them to me.
WILL: No!
RIDER:
Then your time is at an end.

RIDER:
Say goodbye to IittIe Tom.
WILL:
No! Tom!
[RIDER GRUNTS]
You're aIone, boy.
You faiIed to find the sixth Sign.
And with onIy five,
you're no match for me.
You're a faiIure, WiII.
MERRIMAN:
I believe in you, Will.
You'll find what you need.
A soul freely given
to unleash the power of the Light.
It's me. My souI.
[HORSE WHINNIES]
I am WiII Stanton. . .
. . .the seventh son of a seventh son.
I have read the book.
I have waIked through time.
I have gathered five Signs.
The sixth couId not be found,
because it was not hidden from me.
I am the sixth Sign.
And I have restored. . .
. . .the power of the Light.
[RIDER YELLS]
[RIDER SCREAMS]
It's over, right?
It's never over.
But today is a good day.
WILL:

GEORGE:
Mr. Dawson.
George.
I wanna go home.
GREYTHORNE:
I think you shouId.
There's someone
who wants to go with you.
Tom.
There's some peopIe
I want you to meet.
Come on.
WiII?
You did aII right.
He might have shown some appreciation,
after aII we've done for him.
He's onIy 1 4. It's a difficuIt age.
[INAUDIBLE]
John? John.
