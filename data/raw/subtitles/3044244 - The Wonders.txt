Francè, what you're looking at?
There's a house that way.
Hey!
Where are you going?
Here...
Are you going to mom?
I can't hear you...
I have to pee...
-Then go.
Are you done?
I have to poo...
We'll see.
Go to bed,  I can't concentrate...
What's happening?
Go to sleep, mom...
Marinella's got to poop, isn't that true?
I...
-What?
Let me in...
You wanna come in the big bed?
Why you said you had to poo?
Calm down, you can both come...
Mom!  I'm hungry!
-I knew it!
See?
-I'm hungry...
I think we need a door here...
Mom!  Mom!
Mom, let's make crepes!
-Me too!
Didn't you have to poop?
Be quiet...
Is that all?
Good... go to bed now.
We all go to bed now...
and get up early tomorrow.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Nothing, dad.
Turn it off.
Did someone shoot?
-No... come on, get up.
We need to switch the buckets.
Yes, I know.
Fuck you, hunters!
Shoot your own dick!
Enough!
Enough!
Shit!
Where are you all?
Gelsomina!  Let's go!
Marinella...
Marinella!
Gelsomina... no...
We've been waiting you for 2 hours.
Let's go.
I didn't hear you...
Yea, sure...
You bring along the little ones.
No, you keep 'em, I'm too busy...
I gotta do the tomatoes.
Cocò's gonna help you, she's not on vacation...
if she wants to stay she's gotta work.
Cocò!
Move your ass if you wanna stay!
Take 'em with you, please...
You gotta start bringing 'em eventually.
Hold on!
Switch the buckets!
Smoke, Gelsomina.
Dad!
What...
There's a hole in the mask...
bees are gonna sting me...
Go in the car then... and don't bother me.
They're gonna sting her...
There wasn't any hole in the mask...
We're better off alone, aren't we?
Smoke 'em.
They are few... they escaped, dammit...
Where have they gone?  That way?
Are you there?
Come on!
Move the box this way.
A little higher.
Look out...
Higher, dad... like that...
Marinella...
What are you doing?
There's blackberries!
-Ok...
There's blackberries...
-Let's go.
They won't let us in...
What?
-They won't let us in...
Open up!
Open up...
No!
Yes...
-Nooo...
Open up goddammit!
-No...
Open up!
Gelsomina, come here.
Pull the stings out.
Come here, Gelsomina!  Dive in!
Gelsomina!
Come here!
Excuse me?
Could you tell them to be more quiet, please?
What?
Could you make less noise?
I can't hear you!
Excuse me... could you be more quiet?
Could you move, please?
You move!  My daughters are free!
I mean that...
Why?
Now be quiet and stay there...
It's alright... it was just them.
All ready?  Silence, please...
Step away from the rock...
Milly... step away from the rock.
Slowly...
Proceed like that...
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
It was a secret, but now I can tell...
Our great return...
The land of wonders will be here,
among the riches of Etruscan country...
Among families still living like in "pristory"...
-No!
Isn't that "prehistory"?
-Yes, I know!
I'm here, among families still living
like... long time ago...
We'll spend a long, beautiful night
in the necropolis at the center of the lake...
And in this levity between life and death...
We'll talk about sausages, hams, cheese
and many more delights!
This hat is so heavy...
One more take?
All ready...
Little ones, come here!  Let's go!
Wolfgang!  Are you gonna make
a boy someday or what?
Soon, you'll see...
-We'll see...
Gelsomina!  Call your sisters!
Gelso!  Come on!
Luna... Cate... out!
Out!
Pretty faces!  Come here!
Come closer...
How sweet...
What are your names?
-Caterina...-Luna...-Gelsomina...
What?
Caterina...  -Gelsomina...  -Luna...
You're so beautiful, ma'am...
Your hair is like sea foam...
Thank you...
Igor?  Where are you?
Take these.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
This is for you.
Bye...
Bye...
-Bye...
Throw that thing, come on...
I can't believe it... it's all bullshit...
You got nothing in your head?
Help me, come on.
How many hives are there?
-42.
We get it out right away, alright...
Alright?
-Yes...
Cocò!
-We're very busy now, Wolfgang!
I was thinking...
If we work well and plenty...
If you work plenty...
We'll buy you a present.
What?
I don't know, we can buy...
A camel?
What did he say?
A camel?
Yes... you used to like it.
Yes, when I was a child...
And it's against the law.
The law?  Who's gonna ever find it here?
Now... drink, it's good for you, come on...
Drink.
Drink...
Luisa, are you watching?
-Yes.
Yes, I'm talking to you...
If you run a family business,
providing typical products,
you can take part in the selection...
"The land of wonders."
We'll pick only 7 families, and the most involved in the conservation of our heritage...
Will win a lot of money and a cruise in the South Seas.
-Hey, what's wrong?
Nothing...
Are you watching, Luisa?
-Yes, yes...
They came to the town hall...
I found them the spot in the Necropolis.
The mayor was there too,
he was very pleased to see the TV people.
Would you like one more snack?
-No, mom...
What about you?
No, thanks.
Are you being shy?
-No...
Yes she is!
You want the snack... look at me...
Hey, Gelsomina!
Come!
Come on!
You're not on vacation.
Sit here and help us.
What you're doing?  Go away!
Are you mad?
It's a bad time, sweetie... bad news...
Gelsomina, go get me a rod...
the peels are stuck.
No... a stick is better.
They want to get rid of us, I'm sure.
There's gotta be a solution, Wolfgang.
We have to think it through...
-Enough, we'll look for a new place.
Is this good?
-Yes, thanks.
Dad?
What!
If we take part...
To what?
In the selection, the land of wonders...
Like we need that bullshit!
Dad, trust me!  Mom...
-Mom agrees with me!
I don't know what you're talking about...
-Nothing.
It's a TV show... you go on the island and...
If you get picked you can present your products.
Look...
Seems like a nice thing...
why you're always against everything?
Wait... we have nothing to lose, is it free?
Yes and we can win a lot of money...
-Enough!  We don't need a lot of money!
We need nothing!
Mom...
Yes, love?
When I'll be 60, you'll be dead?
Yes, now peel the tomatoes.
Maybe not a lot, but a few money wouldn't hurt...
Angelica, you gotta be on my side.
I'm a little tired of that...
She's tired now...
When I'll be 60, how old
Gelsomina is gonna be?
64, why?
It's not fair, she'll stay with you
4 years more than me...
Marinella... she was born 4 years before you,
it's normal.
I'm gonna leave before, you can catch up...
Good, Gelso!
We leave, you and me...
What the fuck do you mean?
-Sayin "fuck" is not mandatory...
Finish the work!
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm just wondering
what's best for your daughter.
She's asking you a nice thing...
She's not asking to go to the disco...
But to take part in a contest
of farmers and wonders and stuff...
And you?
Nothing!
Nothing from your side!
Do you think she wants to be a farmer?
Why not?
-You wanna build a wall around her?
A high wall, is that what you want?
So...
"Adaptation to standard sanitary rules
in protection of the consumer..."
Get to the important part.
-Yes...
"Honeybee farm sector"
"The general laboratory surface divided into 4..."
-I don't understand...
It means this room should be
divided in 4 parts, of which...
"Two assigned to the extraction, with washable
and disinfectable walls up to 2 meters..."
"Light colored floors, sloping
into a siphoned drain..."
-What?
It means there should be a hole...
and we don't have it...
And...
"The farms that won't fit the regulations by November 21st
will have the machinery seized and be shut down."
Stop it!!!
Thank you...
Girls, come here!
You would need a slave.
Instead of 4 daughters.
Pick 'em, don't eat 'em!
-Mmmhh...
Mmmhh what?
Come on, pick 'em!
Gelsomina... help us, please...
What's that limp?
Come on, help us out!
Bring the bucket.
What a long face... my...
Let's hurry, it'll rain soon.
Hello...
Here's my wife:
Hello.  Ilde, from Germany.
From the "New Life" project.
You may have heard about us.
He is Martin...
You can't decide all by yourself,
you understand me?
Don't overreact... I just forgot...
It can't be all easy.
Mom?
I'm fine, dear... just go.
What does it mean?
It means...
If I had known, I could have...
Let's get down now, they'll worry...
You're gonna make coffee...
-I don't think it's a good idea.
We keep him 3 or 4 months,
'til winter and we're done.
Did you see him?
He's just a kid!
Have you seen the muscles?
He's strong, he's gonna help me.
He's dangerous... for the girls.
No?
What no?
-There's the police.
Don't mind the police.
Let's go down.
Who's dangerous, mom?
No one, dear.
Ok, let's go.
Never take your eyes off him.
If anything happens,
call the Carabinieri.
They collaborate with us.
It's in his interest to collaborate.
If this rehabilitation goes wrong,
he's going to the Juvenile for 2 years.
He's 14yrs old and he got into some trouble...
nothing serious.
What did he do?
What did he do?
-Typical start of a criminal career.
Robbery, arson...
They sent him forward
cause he's small and fast.
Yes... he robbed some... how do you say...
almost nothing.
"Criminal career"... what did he do?
Would you explain to my wife
the matter of money?
Money?
My role is strictly educative,
I don't talk about money.
But after the first examination
you gonna get money.
Who's the head of the family?
We all are...
-No, she is!  She is... Gelsomina!
Don't get carried away...
-No, it's true!
So, not all of you are...
Head of the family!
I wanna know, little lady,
how are discussions like in the family...
Much violent?
Hitting?  Yelling?
Not much...
-Nothing!
Because violence is absolutely forbidden.
We prefer to speak with "methodo" to these boys.
What's this "methodo"?
-Will you shut your mouth?
I just wanna understand!
How can you understand
if you never shut up?
This is the behavior you must avoid.
So...
We have to do a lot of work...
Gelsomina will explain you everything.
We have to arrange the laboratory
and increase the number of bees.
Are you afraid of bees?
Have you ever been stung?
Can't you remember?
Can't you remember?
Does he understand?
Fuck!  Good!
Don't say "fuck"!
-How does he do that?
He practiced... can you do it?
-No...
Try...
How do you whistle?
They wanna know how do you whistle.
Dad... can you whistle?
No.
Kid, you're talented...
No, never do that.
You never can do that.
May I...
Yes, come in.
Is he good-looking?
Kinda...
Do it...
-Now?
Marì, go switch the buckets!
I can't...
Hurry up!
What have you done??
Get the paper!
Are you crazy?
Dad, it's just a little...
-A drop...
You gotta be careful!
-It was an accident...
And you let her switch the buckets?
Tell me how can she do that?
You ask him!  That's what he's here for!
Martin!  Come here!
Come!
Take the bucket there.
Bravo!
Here, come on.
Women...
Stay calm.
They can feel if you're nervous.
Come.
Wait, Gelsomina... let him open it.
Come!  Quick!
Remove this.
Good.
See how nice it is?
Dad... they are few...
-Few?
The plague!
It's not the plague...
It's poison.
Poison...
Come inside.
Good morning!
Hi.
Where  is your brother?
-Inside.
Good evening...
-Hey, Wolfgang...
You got a new worker...
No, he's German...
I have to talk to you.
-Me too...
The TV people came, for the selection...
They took a look around and had a taste
of something... and they liked it...
But not only that they did like...
What...
They liked my grandma...
Grandma!  They say you're pretty!  Telegenic!
They enjoyed the wine too...
they made fun of me...
No, no... come on...
Listen... I don't have time to lose...
What did you put in the field?
-What do I know...
Some new product maybe?
Here we go again...
Ma!  Go get me the bucket of herbicide please!
I can't, I'm making the sauce now...
Ok, I'll get it...
Here... this one.
You're a fool!
If you say so, I believe it...
You mustn't use this!
It's deadly!  Do you get it?
Calm down... the consortium gave it to us,
that means we can use it.
They are killing you!
They're fucking up your head!
He's right...
-Don't overreact...
It's a scam, Natalì!
First they make the tourists come and buy everything...
-They take control...
Then they just send us away.
It's true...
-True what?
He's right...
-Shut up you...
We gotta stay unite.
Together!
-Together we can do something...
Cause it won't last...  it won't...
Then we'll see those who
can't even plant salad...
How will they survive?
Cause you don't plant pizza...
-No, you don't plant pizza.
You don't.
What will they do when money
will become useless?
Will be useless...  we could use
money right now.
You know him...  you're suspicious,
but here nothing has happened in years.
This could create jobs...  tourism...
We already have a beautiful job!
Am I right?
-No way...
We need rocks!
Bring over a rock!
Is this good?
Yes!
Lay down on top of the bees!
Martin!  You too!
It's gonna stop.
Dad?
Dad!
What!
Shall we try that TV thing?
It'll be over in 5 minutes.
Hey... did they sting you?
Luna!  Caterina!
Look how messed up you are...
were you playing in the mud?
-Yes...
We catch our breath when he's not around...
Push!
Push, girls!
You hang on!
We'll get to the island...
-Faster!
How do you know the way?
Have you been here before?
Yes.
Is it the place where they're making that show?
It's beautiful.
How do they carry the set and
all the rest up here?
I've never been here.
He likes it here...
-Yes...
Where are you going?
Come here...
Show me that eye.
Listen, Gelso...
-Mom!
Mom!
Are you coming?
What's there, Marinè?
-I'll show you something.
What you're doing?
If he turns we say hello?
Where are you?
Gelsomina!  Let's go!
We came here to save you, right?
-Yes...
Say a price.
Have you seen all those bees?
-Yes...
So... name a fair price.
Come, Martin.
Look.
Come on! We're leaving!
Yes.
Gelsomina!
Why isn't she coming?
-Dunno...
Can't she hear me?
Gelso...
Come!  Pull the stings out!
Where?
I said Gelsomina... she sees better.
-What am I?  Blind?
It hurts.
Gelsomina, you stay here.
Shouldn't we make the swarms?
-Get off!
I'll have to teach him!
Martin, come in front.
What's up?
Did they give you this?
It also came in pink or purple,
but sincerely... what's the best?
This one...
-Thank you...
Are you coming with us?
I can't... I gotta stay here...
Come on...
Alright... bye, see you later.
-Bye.
May I have a vase, dear?
Which one?
This one.
How much?
-5.
You raised the price?
-No no...
Gelso...  go...
There you go.
-Thanks.
Go for a walk.
Where's Gioia?
-I don't know... not here.
Can I sign up?
Of course, the form's right there...
give her a pen.
Gelsomina?
Gelsomina... it's me!
What a surprise!
Fucking hunters.
Lun...a
She's Luna and she's Caterina...
My friend... two more girls...
can't you make a boy?
You want one too?
A bracelet with your name on?
And you, Cocò... you want it?
A bracelet with your name on?
Leave me alone!
Wolfgang...
If you don't throw him out, I'll do it myself
even if it's not my home.
You used to like me...
"Come, Adrian... come..."
you said...
Water is boiling, Angelica?
Come here...
Marinella, why aren't you helping?
-My head hurts... very bad...
Mom... come...
Sleeping time?
-No...
Yes it is, you're tired... let's go.
Good night.
-Good night.
What organization!
You really have changed.
Why?
I don't know, you're different...
You gave up the fight...
you're here cleaning, producing...
When we lived together it was different,
right, Cocò?
Nonsense...
it's a mess here...
If we don't update
they'll shut us down.
By November 21st.
No... they just wanna scare us.
What... they are serious.
Thank God lately they're all busy
with these shitty Etruscans.
They all wonder where
the Etruscans come from.
Why nobody wonders where
the Milaneses come from?
The Milaneses...
Eh, Angelica!
Shall we go to Milan?
I'm fine right here.
What about you, Cocò?
Leave me alone.
And you, Gelsomina?  Milan?
Ok.
Yes?  Really?
Look out, this daughter's gonna run away.
Cut it out.
If I hadn't her...
I remember you as a child.
You always had to be the last one
we said 'good night' to.
And you, only with him,
"daddy daddy daddy!"
You became a woman.
Shut up, she's still a kid.
Bullshit...
Up!
Who are you?
Eehh... he is...
-He can whistle very good.
Is that right?
-Kinda...
Let me hear you... whistle.
Whistle!  Is he deaf or what?
Yes, if we had more time
it would be better.
There's Cocò's money.
The kid's money.
He's helping you... right?
Not much.
I have no use of this kid.
I don't trust him anymore,
he's changed.
You see enemies everywhere.
-I don't.
Yes, you do.
You know, we could sell the sheeps.
Are you listening?
-Yes.
Mom...
Yes, love?
I have to talk to you
about something I've done.
Tell me.
If it's an excuse, there's nobody here.
Is it an excuse?
What happened?
Nothing.
It's not filled yet.
It's important... you won't get the money
if the papers aren't filled.
Evaluate his learning skills...
Good.
You said he couldn't do nothing.
-Yes, dad... but he learned.
Collaboration?
Good.
Sufficient... he often doesn't listen.
Ok, we'll finish in the car.
Cocò, you take care of lunch...
there's plenty of leftovers.
When i come back,
the honey must be all poured.
We'll be back tonight.
It's our song... come.
Cut it out!
Put 'em there.
What are you two doing?
Nothing...
It's nothing!
Calm down!
Did you switch the bucket?
The bucket...
And you?
-What?
Did you switch the buckets?
Marinella...
Marinella!
Not here, please...
We gotta know how the girl was hurt...
you say with a work machine...
Yes... ehm...
They were playing, you know...
we live in the country...
Yes but, the tetanus injection... it's important...
Did she get the injection?
Cocò... the bucket...
We didn't switch.
Gelsomina... dad's gonna kill us...
Got it?
Yes he'll kill us, alright!
Marinella, go get the large brush.
Come on, girls... we have to clean.
Come on!
Luna, don't play around!
We gotta pick it all up!
Gelsomina...
Gelsomina!
-What!
A man just arrived...
A man?
You go!
-I'll go...
Who is that man?
The man from 'The land of wonders'.
Gelso!  How do you make coffee?
If that's for me, don't bother...
I don't drink coffee, thank you.
Look at his eyes.
I present you Gelsomina, the great
beekeeper of this family farm.
Hello.
-Hello.
Can I speak to a holder?
You can speak to us,
we work here, you know?
I need to see the place where you
make honey, the laboratory...
It's important to us to verify the productivity
of the farm at the present time.
I mean, now.
Even more if you'll get selected,
I need to see the laboratory.
Of course... yes...
But first you have to taste something...
No, don't bother...
-No, it's very important!
No, Mrs... don't...
-Miss!
-Sorry...
Plenty of vitamins inside here.
What is it?
Everything's in order here, is it?
-Yes...
We're doing some adjustments,
washable walls and groovings.
May I...
-Of course.
You're here...
I'm leaving him... this time is too much...
He spent it all.
-What happened?
Girls, if I leave him
you know I'm doing it for you as well...
Stay calm...
We have a surprise.
What surprise?  We have overdue rent,
debts, laboratory...
I tried but with him it's impossible!
What happened to you?
What happened?
Where is Gelsomina?
Where are my princesses?
Where is Gelsomina...
Gelsomina!
-Dad, we have a surprise!
I also have a present.
You know what is the present?
That I'm leaving you!  You're wearing us out!
Go away!
Gelso!
I have a beautiful present!
-What present, dad?
You tell first.
-No, you tell.
-No, you first...
Marinella cut herself but when we came back
the man from the TV said we had won.
What?
Yes...
All problems are solved.
Why?
Because we gonna win the contest
of 'The land of wonders'!
The selector said that.
How did Marinella cut her hand?
-With the honey maker, mom...
I had my hand inside and then Gelsomina...
Gelsomina did it on purpose!
-No... they were pouring honey...
Then I heard a scream...
Why did that man came?
But... he said nothing about the lab...
He just had a taste...
He said "How good this honey, Miss!
I want some more!"
With such a honey you gotta win the contest...
that's what he said.
Who the fuck called him?
But...
When we came back from the hospital...
-Hospital??
Yes... for... yes, from the hospital...
We came back and the man was here...
A very handsome man... elegant...
Who called him here??
Cocò!  I'm talking to you!
Eehmm... he was already here and...
It was me, dad.
You didn't ask me first...
No.
In case you didn't hear, 
they've been to the hospital...
Was it painful, sweetie?
-Yes, look...
You tell bullshit!
Dad...
Always overreacting...
-Forget about him...
You know how much money we could win?
A first class laboratory...
Where's the present, dad?
Dad... is it only for Gelsomina?
For who?
Gelsomina...
Dad!
Thank you dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Do you need help?
-No!
Let me do something...
-No!
Dad...
Attention, please... in a few minutes
we'll get to the island...
Please, don't scatter
and follow the directions to the Necropolis...
I repeat... follow the operators
and stay in the group with your color, thank you.
Turn around... wave to spectators... perfect.
First are the blues, which are fishermen...
then the greens, hunters...
Then come the reds, farmers...
-Girls, go straight down... thanks.
Gentlemen of the jury, not here...
over there, please.
Mr. Portarena comes with me in the red zone...
which is for farmers...
Along with your mother, sister, cousin...
-And my grandma.   -And grandma.
Ma'am, how about rehearsing some singing?
No.
But we're here to rehearse, 
it's better if you sing a song.
No.
Sing, ma'am... it's important...
-Sing, grandma!
No.
-You have to!
I said no.
-You sing, ma'... please.
Wonderful!
An applause!
Did you hear, jurors?
-We did and they were very exceptional...
To you, selector.
Good evening to everyone, 
and to the people at home...
Just a question... why these ladies are not in museums along with paintings of famous artists?
That's right... we're in the
Grotta Balena tomb...
Among the descendants of
the mysterious Etruscan people.
We know little about them,
we can't read their writing...
But we can tell some things from their drawings...
They had livestock holdings,
just like the son of the lady...
No, the grandson of the lady...
Producer of sausages, hams and other delights.
-That's right...
We make everything ourselves, at home...
And then...
We're in the pork field since forever... 
And then... we've always watched your show,
we never miss one contest.
And to win is a dream I've had
for a long time.
And then... can I tell you one thing?
You're a beautiful woman, Milly.
Thank you... if your wife hears you...
I'm single... no wife...
Women don't come to live in the country,
they're used to comfort and luxury.
If you win the 1st prize who you're
taking with you on the trip?  Grandma?
I'd use the prize to set up an agritourism...
So that tourists will be able to
admire the beauties of this place...
So tourists will come, or better... female tourists.
-I'll be there with my arms open...
Very good!
Thank you...
-You're welcome!
Now we change subject and move
to the bee farmers family.
This gentleman comes from far away,
with his family and children...
Makes a delicious honey.
Can you tell us how it works?
It's honey.
Natural, and...
Virgin...
It's natural, we don't...
We don't add anything to it.
We bring the bees to the flowers.
You don't bring the flowers to the bees.
-No, the other way around.
Is there something else?
Some secret we should know 
about this nice tradition?
Yes...
I wanna say...
Some things... you cannot buy...
I was saying...
Talk to the spectators home.
-Yes...
When we work this honey...
It is totally...
The world is about to end...
Exactly... some things you cannot buy.
And that takes me to these two brothers.
They dress different, have different weapons,
but one single passion.
Etruscan people used spears, arrows...
here instead?
Good evening, what are your names?
Excuse me?
We haven't finished.
Tell me, dear.
We've prepared a little show.
A little show?
Let's see the little show, go ahead.
Eeehmm... wonderful!
Brava!
And now let's move to...
The ballet... music!
You were so pretty...
Really... prettier than all the rest...
So little...
Your little hands...
You're pretty.
I am pretty too.
-Yes...
I'm beautiful.
-Yes.
I'm hot!
Who's there?
-He followed us.
Martin!  Come!
Step out of the dark.
He can't understand you...
-You're always hiding...  that's no good...
He don't understand!
-He understands everything... come!
Where there are two human beings,
they gotta love each other...
What you're saying?
And also touch, like this...
see Martin?  Like this...
You also have to touch.
Also kiss...
-No!
Yes!
Come on, kiss!
No!
You want me to show you how it's done?
I'll show you?
-No!
Stop it!  No!
See what you've done?  See?
Martin!
There she is...
Here she comes...
The little Etruscan...
Thank you...
The winner is...
Mr. Portarena.
A hand for Mr. Portarena!
And for his beautiful grandma!
Excuse me!
It's really late, please come aboard!
Tell him to blow the whistle again!
Can you blow it again?
The Carabinieri will help you!
My daughter's missing!
Two kids... you got it?
They're with a responsible grown woman,
they're not alone!
It's really late, we have to leave!
-The Carabinieri will find them, we have to go...
Dad...
Where have you been?
What have you done?
Speak!  Speak, dammit!
Let me go!
-Calm down!  I understand you're worried...
We can't find him...
What?
-We can't find Martin.
Enough!
Enough...
Wolfgang!  They say he left
on the other boat!
What?
He left with the other boat.
-Are you sure?
So they say.
-Seems strange to me... all by himself...
Gelso, look...
Do you have a tissue?
What?
Tissue...
-No.
Come here!
Me?
Me?
Sit here.
Aren't you tired?
Don't you want the camel too?
-No... what for...
Try the circus.
-What?
The circus...
-Yes, the circus...
Gather all his stuff,
nothing must be left here.
We take everything away.
You know the consequences for him...
They'll find him,
I'm sure he couldn't go far.
Mom?
Can i bring that down?
I think I'll find him.
I think that to educate,
You must control yourself,
be detached.
You're confused,
too involved in things.
You're unable to adapt to the world.
You don't know what's going on out there.
You do know...
I got a sense of it.
Can I speak to Gelsomina now?
Marinella...
Call your sister.
Where's Gelso?
Don't know...
Why?  Where has she gone?
-Come here...
What's happening?
Mom... look...
Don't get mad now...
You neither.
Let me stay here...
Little one...
There's room...  come on.
We were worried... but not too much...
You know what I was thinking?
That... we'll have something secret
to hide inside the house.
Under the tiles maybe.
And that secret, in many years, 
will be discovered...
Gelso... what are you thinking?
Did you hear that?
A ghost!
TO BAUMI.
