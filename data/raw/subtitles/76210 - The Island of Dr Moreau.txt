Come on, Charlie, we made it.
We're all right, Charlie.
There's bound to be some water
in there, somewhere.
Don't let...
Good morning.
He's coming to, M'Ling.
Well, you won't get any medals,
but you do look better.
Who... Who are you?
Name is Montgomery.
Charlie.
- The other man?
- Yes...
Yes, he is all right?
We've buried him.
Oh, God.
Died of thirst and exposure.
You're the lucky one.
How long have you been adrift?
I...
Seventeen days?
And nights.
- You sure?
- Well, no.
No.
You're a seaman.
Engineering officer.
Lady Vain?
Yes.
We broke our back in a storm
and sank in minutes.
What is this place?
This place?
Paradise.
Just where on earth is paradise?
Slap in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
Exactly 1,000 miles from nowhere.
Exactly.
We haven't met. Officially, that is.
I'm Dr. Moreau.
Andrew Braddock, sir.
From the good shipwreck Lady Vain.
Ship's engineer officer. Adrift 17 days,
and lying here for four.
Thank you, Mr. Montgomery.
Mr. Montgomery runs this establishment.
I own it.
Let's have a look at you.
Seventeen days.
Remarkable how the flesh reasserts itself.
This island, it... It
is on a scheduled run?
Well, there hasn't been a ship
in some time, so we're due.
Meanwhile, we'll see if we can't find
some way to keep you amused.
Well, at least you have books here.
You're a reader, are you?
What else is there to do at sea
except tend to the engines and stop fights?
Well, you'll find
we have an excellent library.
How long have you been here?
Eleven years.
It's truly amazing
how the flesh reasserts itself.
She belongs to Moreau.
He wants to know
if you're feeling up to dinner.
I can see you're up to it.
Tell me.
What kind of animals are there
on this island?
All kinds, lad, all kinds.
Mr. Braddock.
Maria, this is Mr. Braddock.
Look up, Maria.
Mr. Braddock has come
to stay with us for a while.
- Has he come for your work?
- No.
Just till the next ship arrives.
Is dinner ready, do you suppose?
- Shall I see?
- Please.
- She's certainly very beautiful.
- Yes, extraordinary.
It pleases me
to have her dress the way she does.
She didn't wash ashore, too, did she?
No. I brought her here.
I found her in a crib in Panama City.
At the age of 11, any man could have her
for the price of a dozen eggs.
Do you still find her beautiful?
Yes. I'm no moralist.
Good.
She's a very delicate creature.
She's had some bad experiences.
By the way, Mr. Braddock,
now that you're up and about,
you must never leave
the compound after dark.
Why? What's out there?
Just a jungle island.
We haven't had a chance
to explore it just yet,
but one of these days
I hope to find the time.
There's been a great deal of talk
about flying machines,
although so far no one's been able
to get more than a few feet off the ground.
But what they have done, though,
is to go underwater in a craft
that can stay submerged for hours on end.
- Yes, just a few months ago in Bristol...
- How about man?
I mean, the developments you speak of
are certainly not to be ignored.
But how about man himself?
His development?
We know exactly how
and why an engine works.
But a one-celled organism
is more complex,
more mysterious
than your most sophisticated machine.
There's been enormous advances
in technology.
But how much in man?
I haven't seen any.
You haven't exactly
looked in the best places.
I've looked where I've been.
Mr. Montgomery was a mercenary.
Still am.
Whoever pays the most.
I'll say good night. I have much to do.
You say there are all kinds of animals
on this island.
But what kinds exactly?
I'm gonna strike a bargain
with you, Mr. Braddock.
When you require a drink,
my quarters are next to the gate.
When it comes to questions,
you save them for Dr. Moreau.
Good night.
The servants here,
are they from this island?
Nobody was here before Dr. Moreau.
What do you mean?
He brought everyone here?
Yes.
When I saw you,
I thought he brought you, too.
Are there... Are there
other islands nearby?
I think so.
Well, how far?
I don't know.
You haven't been off this island, have you?
No. There's no boat.
But one does stop here.
Sometimes.
How often?
When did one call here last?
Not long ago.
And you saw it?
No. Dr. Moreau told me.
I never saw it.
Why'?
He didn't let me.
Was he afraid you'd leave?
I couldn't leave.
I wouldn't live anywhere else but here.
What is your name?
Braddock.
Andrew.
Good night, Andrew.
Good night.
"Moreau, Paul. Born April 12th, 1851.
"Boston, Massachusetts.
"Doctor of chemistry, physiology, anatomy.
"Showed brilliant promise
in his early monographs
"on cellular structure and growth."
ls that what you're looking for?
I was curious.
"His most significant contributions
were made before the age of 30.
"But his work was severely criticized
by academicians
"as being highly speculative
and insufficiently documented."
Exactly 44 words.
"Severely criticized by academicians."
And actively opposed by his colleagues.
Too often men of vision become outcasts.
My books.
The distillation
of man's experience on earth.
Immortality and the soul.
The nature of good and evil.
The physical universe.
And here,
eugenics and inheritance.
Why is one flower red, another yellow?
Why is one man tall, the next one short?
Why...
I hope I'm not boring you, Mr. Braddock.
No, no. I'm fascinated.
Please.
Let me show you something.
Embryos.
A dog,
a mouse,
a human.
They look almost the same.
They virtually start out the same.
A bit of protoplasm, a nucleus,
a chain of chromosomes.
And yet we all know
what they turn out to look like. Why?
How does a cell
become enslaved to a form,
to a destiny it can never change?
Can we change that destiny?
Should we?
Good night, Mr. Braddock.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Beautiful.
I found her.
I found this.
Come in.
Have you seen Dr. Moreau?
If it's company you're
looking for, it's here.
- Have a drink, lad?
- No, thanks.
Don't reject my hospitality, Braddock,
I don't extend it very often.
Now, what else can I offer you?
- The man who serves us dinner...
- M'Ling?
Yes.
I saw him out there
in the jungle, drinking water.
Except he wasn't drinking it,
he was sucking it up.
A local custom.
But the way he did it.
The way he looked. He...
He was crouched down on all fours.
I told you, local custom.
Moreau'll tell you all about it.
As I said before,
Moreau'll explain anything.
I'm just another servant.
If you don't like it, why do you stay?
I sleep better here.
Not well,
but better.
Take him away.
Mr. Braddock,
you've seen something
I didn't want you to see.
- That was M'Ling, wasn't it?
- Yes, yes, that was M'Ling.
- What happened to him?
- What happened to him?
I'm not sure I know.
I mean, ultimately, I don't know.
But why shackle him in chains?
Look, I'm exhausted.
I've been up all night.
We'll discuss this later.
But what about... What about his face?
In your engine room,
things are predictable. You control them.
But my work is always elusive.
It doesn't always provide answers.
Just more questions.
What the hell have you done to him?
M'Ling is a very special kind
of human being.
And I simply wish you to know
I'm trying to help him.
What happened, Mr. Braddock?
What's wrong?
I was chased.
Chased? By what?
I don't know. Something.
I couldn't be sure.
Those creatures! What are they?
Well, how many were there?
Well, two, three, maybe four! I don't know!
- What in God's name is...
- Control yourself, Mr. Braddock.
We'd better have a look around.
You go back to the compound. That way.
What were they?
What in the name of God do you do in here?
Don't worry, Braddock,
you'll get over it just like I did.
Tend to the horses, Mr. Montgomery.
This...
This creature, what is it?
See for yourself, Mr. Braddock.
It's a bear, is it not?
Bear? It's not possible.
Well, whatever it is, it's in pain.
What have you done to it?
Mr. Braddock,
when you first came to this island,
I was apprehensive.
I was sorely tempted
to set you adrift again.
But the idea offended my sensibilities.
And then I saw
that you were intelligent and curious.
Virtues of the scientific mind.
I'm not sure you will ever understand
what I'm about to show you.
But I find myself wanting to.
I have proved, almost proved,
the existence of a cell particle
that controls the living organism.
This cell, this particle,
controls the shape of life.
This is the second stage
in the treatment of this creature.
This serum contains the distillation
of a biological code message.
A new set of instructions erasing the
natural instincts of the animal.
Some surgery
with implants into various organs
and he should grow
to resemble any creature we please.
In this case, a human being.
God almighty.
You see?
The serum is already
forcing a modification of the body.
But why do you do this?
For what possible reason?
Why'?
To reach for the control of heredity.
Think, Mr. Braddock,
think of what we can do for humanity.
The pain we can ease.
The deformities we can avoid.
The possibilities are endless.
Those women. Those servants.
- Even they're...
- Animals, yes.
So is that.
Stop it!
There was nothing wrong. He was perfect.
But he's still an animal.
Get Montgomery! Get Montgomery!
Montgomery?
You are human.
You are human!
Montgomery, what is that up there?
It is a man.
It is a man.
Like us.
Like us.
He must learn the law.
What is the law?
Not to walk on all fours.
Are we not men?
What is the law?
Not to eat flesh.
That is the law.
Not to shed blood!
That is the law.
What is the law?
Not to go on all fours.
That is the law.
What is the law?
Not to hunt other men, that...
Stop.
The law has been broken.
He who breaks the law shall be punished!
Back to the House of Pain!
Back to the House of Pain!
This master!
He is as I am.
If you do not obey him, he will punish you.
His is the hand that makes.
His
is the hand that hurts.
His is the hand that heals.
His is the House of Pain.
His is the House of Pain.
His is the House of Pain.
I think I understand
what you're telling me,
but these things, these
creatures, they're...
- Well, they're human.
- Partly.
- Human enough.
- For what?
Pity.
Pity?
Understanding. Consideration.
Yes. Consideration.
And haven't I considered them?
They've been lifted,
chosen above all animals,
been given speech.
The beginnings of a society, laws.
Laws so that you can control them!
- You have no right!
- Right?
- There have to be feelings!
- Feelings?
Is that what your heart tells you,
ship's engineer?
Does it ache for my poor creatures?
You may recall that the human heart
is no longer considered the seat
of emotions,
except by simple-minded lovers.
It's an organ for pumping blood,
for preserving life.
We discovered that by invading the temple
of the human body and chopping it apart!
Whereupon science was considered
to be ruthless, cruel, savage!
But we did learn to deal
with heart disease.
Well, those bodies were dead
before they were dissected.
Animals are put to death
for the same reasons.
These aren't animals, not anymore.
Exactly.
They're touched with humanity.
And some of the noble virtues of humanity.
Rage, anger, hatred. Homicidal hatred.
You've given them something to hate!
Do you want to live? Do you?
Then they will have to fear you
as they fear me.
I want no part of this.
You have no choice.
I told you a ship will be coming.
It will, the supply ship,
but not for two years.
Yes. Two long years.
So, like it or not, you're one of us.
And if you wish to survive,
you will have to behave as one of us.
At times I rise above my ambition,
mostly I fail below it.
I bring them
to within a hair's breadth of being human.
Almost give them human form,
feeling, thought, speech.
But always in the end, almost always,
they revert to what they once were.
Lion, bear, hyena.
I've suffered many disappointments,
but I've learned to wait, to watch,
and in the end I will succeed.
Understandably, they fear this place.
The pain they've suffered.
And when they reverse,
they bring back into their brute lives
the memory of that experience.
Their human legacy.
In the image of our own species,
they become vengeful killers.
Now do you understand? Do you?
If they spill one drop of blood, just once,
it will drown us all.
Ready, Doctor.
Mr. Braddock,
there's something I'd like you to see.
Hardly resembles the creature who
attacked you in the cave, now does he?
What are you going to do to him?
Take him back to the cave.
Either they'll take him in
or they'll eat him for dinner.
They'll take him in, have no fear.
Coming with us, Mr. Braddock?
No, thank you.
He is man again.
It is well.
No! Not well.
Better as animal.
Strong, proud,
not this.
This is human.
This is man. This is law.
His law.
Ours.
No, his!
Our law!
It is our law.
Are we not men?
Are we not men?
There, it's nearly finished.
With some food and water,
and with each other, we'll make it.
There's bound to be
a ship out there somewhere.
Where will we go?
Home.
England, eventually.
What would I do in England?
Be with me.
I'm afraid.
You don't really believe I'm a sailor,
do you?
It isn't that. It's...
Moreau?
I couldn't live anywhere else but here.
But why? Why do you keep saying that?
This is the only place I know.
Braddock!
You're coming with us!
You'll need this.
No.
Now do you see?
You'll have to join us.
Where is the Sayer of the Law?
Say the words. What is the law?
Not to go on all fours.
That is the law.
What is the law?
Not to hunt other men. That is...
What is the law?
Not to shed blood.
One of you has broken that law. Who?
Who?
Who among you has shed blood?
He who breaks the law
goes back to the House of Pain.
He who breaks the law
goes back to the House of Pain.
Back to the House of Pain.
None escape! None escape!
None escape. None escape!
Follow me! Follow me!
Follow me! Follow me!
Follow me.
Over here, over here.
No House of Pain.
Kill...
Kill...
His is the hand.
His is the hand.
His is the hand.
They don't seem to like you, Braddock!
Get off...
You can't understand, can you?
Don't let him suffer.
I can't help that.
Please.
Maria.
I forgive you, Mr. Braddock,
for wanting to escape.
I hope that you will forgive me
for what I'm about to do.
For the time being you will find it
impossible to move or to speak.
Neither will be necessary.
All the work that I've done brings me time
and again to the same barrier.
No matter how far I take my creatures,
they begin to revert.
But they can't tell me
what's happening inside their bodies
when that occurs. Until now.
You will do that for me.
You will explore that inner battlefield,
that war of the cells,
and bring back the knowledge.
The ultimate knowledge.
To become an animal.
To feel it inside your body and your brain.
What no man has ever known before.
You will bring that back to me.
What have you done to me, you bastard?
What are you doing to me?
Let me go!
Let me go, you bastard! Get off me!
Get off me! Get off me!
Get off me! Get off me!
Get off me! Get off...
Christ!
You've been drinking
for two days, Montgomery.
I suggest you continue.
Let him up.
I said, let him up!
If one is to study nature, one must
become as remorseless as nature.
You should know that.
Who's next? Me?
Unlock those chains
or I swear I'll kill you.
All right, Montgomery.
Keys.
In my room.
Your mental processes are changing.
The way you think is changing.
No!
You're beginning to think in images.
Concrete images.
Hot, cold, light, dark, food, hunger, pain.
I think as I always did.
Words are becoming meaningless to you,
except for the most
elementary commands!
No!
You see? It's happening already.
No! No! No!
You've lost control. You are an animal.
You're the animal!
He tells us not to kill
and yet he kills.
You haven't eaten in two days,
you must be hungry.
To eat, you must do so like an animal.
Never!
You've already entered the first stage.
Your instinct, not your mind,
but your instinct is to tear.
To ease your hunger, to fill your belly.
Try. Go on, try.
Soon enough it'll become natural to you.
I was born in Bolton, Lancashire, England,
on the 27th of March, 1881.
I have two brothers.
Phillip and Robert.
Robert died in a fire.
We used to go sledding in the winter.
Yes, there was a hill
that ran down from the railway station
to the lake.
The lake was called.
Barrow Lake.
The wind... The wind coming off the lake,
it was so cold it used to freeze ice
to the runners of our sleds,
to our hands, to our faces.
Bobby used to laugh, he liked that.
He laughed, he laughed...
I forgot that.
I thought I forgot that.
I...
My first book
was A Christmas Carol.
No. No, no, it was...
was The Sea Cook.
Now you see?
I remember it!
I remember it all!
I remember it all!
Damn you, Braddock!
Damn you!
Let go! Let go!
Andrew! Andrew!
Andrew, Moreau's leaving!
Get Montgomery.
Montgomery's dead.
Dead?
Get the... The...
Get the...
- Key?
- Key, yes.
- Moreau has it.
- Well, get a... Get a...
Maria, help me.
Where's Montgomery?
We have him!
Return him.
I said return him!
Repeat the law! Not to hunt men!
Not to shed blood!
That is the law!
That is the law!
He who breaks the law
must go to the House of Pain!
Back to the cave!
I created you.
I created you.
We have killed.
We have broken the law.
No more laws.
- No more laws!
- No more laws!
No more laws!
We must have laws.
We are not animals.
No more laws!
To the House of Pain!
Stop!
Look at me!
I am as you now!
No!
You master!
Must go to House of Pain!
Maria. Gate.
Animal.
You're an animal.
No! No! No! No!
Creatures of the law,
he is not dead!
You cannot kill Moreau!
Yes, he sees you now,
but you cannot see him!
Fear him, obey his law!
See? See?
He is not dead, he is alive!
He is not alive.
He is dead.
To the House of Pain!
No! No, do not turn them loose!
They're not like us!
Don't!
Don't open those cages!
It's gonna kill...
Push! Push!
Andrew, watch out! Watch out!
Hey!
Maria!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
