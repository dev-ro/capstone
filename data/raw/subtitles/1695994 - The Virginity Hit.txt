Gentlemen,
me and Hannah had sex.
No way. Hannah?
Yeah.
And I'm just gonna
tell you right now,
if you ever have
the experience to,
like, lose your
virginity in a car,
the Acura MDX, where it's at.
Spacious as fuck.
That was a little unnecessary.
ZACK: I'm just doing to you
what you did to Hannah!
And I also got you this.
JACOB: Is that a bong?
Yeah, man.
Dude, happy
virginity day.
JACOB: I'm dedicating
this bong right now.
ZACK: To what?
JACOB:
It's to the four of us.
We will only smoke it
on days on which one of us
loses our virginity.
So we're
smoking it four times.
Yes.
Until the last nut
has been busted.
But I don't smoke weed.
ZACK: Okay, Matt...
JACOB: We'll work
something out.
It's not really
about the high anymore.
I like that
we're just putting it away
for special occasions.
Yeah, it's ceremonial,
you know?
There's a spiritual bond
between the four of us.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
ZACK: To virginity!
JUSTIN: Goodbye.
ZACK: To goodbye virginity!
Okay.
ZACK: She's back.
JACOB: All right.
JACOB: Zack, Zack, Zack.
Anything strange happen
in your life recently
that we should
know about?
(BUBBLING)
JUSTIN: My man.
JACOB: Look at that.
(ZACK COUGHING)
(LAUGHING)
Oh, oh! Boom! Oh!
Oh, shit.
JUSTIN: Oh!
That was fucking...
KRYSTA: Nasty. Nasty.
JUSTIN: Wow.
ZACK: Hey, pal!
You must open the V-card.
Let's do this.
Smoke that shit.
Oh! Oh!
The virginity hit!
Whoo! First hit.
JACOB: Congratulations!
Congrats, dude.
Thank you.
I'm so happy for you, pal.
Thank you.
MATT: I'm really proud of you.
Thank you.
ZACK: Justin, will you
just grab the camera
really quick?
Yeah.
Best friends forever!
Mr. Man.
I'm so proud of you...
So proud of you.
...for getting that nut off.
I'm proud of you,
Justin.
Very important.
Matt, you're next.
JUSTIN: Matt.
You're next, brother.
JUSTIN: When is it
going to happen, man?
"I'm going to have sex soon!"
"I'm Matt!"
ZACK: Hey, what are we doing?
It's my anniversary
with Nicole,
and, you know, you know,
we thought we'd
spice it up a little bit
and actually
have sex this time.
Which condoms do you
think are the best?
Really, I just need...
ZACK:
How big is your penis?
You want lubricated,
non-lubricated, spermicidal?
ZACK: Dude, it's just condoms.
Why are you freaking out?
We're filming...
He's losing his virginity.
MATT:
He's telling everyone,
basically.
Are you having
sex with a virgin?
She'll be tighter.
ZACK: Did you get it?
JUSTIN: Yeah.
I think
it's really good.
Nicole, what is it
about Matt?
ZACK: What is it?
That you're willing
to give yourself to him
so readily?
Well, he's funny...
JUSTIN: Mmm-hmm.
MATT: That's one.
...and attractive.
Two.
NICOLE: Oh!
That's much better, actually.
(LAUGHING)
ZACK: How did you get
such a great girl, Matt?
I mean, honestly.
I mean, come on.
Well, I mean,
by using my wit and
my charm, my skills.
NICOLE: My heart just
melted after that.
That's so gay.
So gay.
It's, like,
borderline awesome.
I'm happy for you guys.
JUSTIN: Me, too.
Thank you.
♪ Oh, Nicole
ZACK: ♪ Oh, Nicole
♪ You're so wonderful to me
♪ To me
♪ You're so
wonderful to me
♪ Oh, Nicole ♪
CASHIER: That's it?
MATT: Yeah.
That's $2.50.
All you gotta do
is just take it slow
and enjoy yourself.
You'll have
a good night, sir.
Enjoy yourself.
You, too.
WOMAN:
What are you guys
doing this for?
So, you just decided
you wanted to
record your journey?
He records everything.
(ZACK LAUGHS)
ZACK: Matt, trust me
when I say this.
As a filmmaker,
and as your best friend,
I'm gonna do to your virginity
what Alfred Hitchcock did
to Birds.
MATT:
It's gonna be scary?
ZACK: No. Matt,
it's gonna be beautiful!
My whole life,
I wanted to get things
on camera or in a picture.
Oh, my God!
Find your
own refrigerator!
ZACK: But you losing
your virginity
is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened.
This is gonna be
our best movie ever.
ZACK:
What do you got planned
for the big night, man?
He's trying to, like,
keep it a secret from me,
but, like, he asks me
really obvious questions...
Like what?
...so, like,
I know what we're doing.
What did he ask you?
He's like, "What's
your favorite restaurant?"
Like, "If you were gonna go
on a really fancy date,
"what restaurant
would you go to?"
He literally
asked that question?
Yeah, he really did.
Wow. These are sexy.
Check these out.
I want to wear a dress.
Right, right, right.
Do you like it? Yes?
Yes, very much so.
JUSTIN: Hey, Nicole,
you know, when Matt's been
kissing you, how is he?
He's been getting better.
JUSTIN: Yeah? It's okay.
NICOLE: Lt'll be okay.
I'm relaxed.
I'm relaxed.
NICOLE: Just, you know,
sometimes he gets
a little stiff, like...
(LAUGHTER)
JUSTIN: Where exactly
does he get stiff?
Because that
might be a good thing.
Sometimes he
doesn't really know
what he's doing
with his hands.
JUSTIN: Yeah,
where does he put them?
NICOLE: Nowhere.
MATT: Uh.
If you show me where...
ZACK: You should know
where the hands go, dude.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.
JUSTIN: Can you instruct Matt
on how this would come off,
you know, easily?
You would take
it from this area
and just pull it...
ZACK:
I just can't wait for you guys
to make love to each other,
because that is just gonna be
such a fucking release.
(SINGING)
Oh, shit,
the string snapped.
Well, you ruined the song,
you dickhole.
ZACK: Come on. Mom!
MOM: Yeah?
Can you do me a favor?
MATT: I call top.
That's what she said.
Oh!
Oh!
ZACK: Justin, up here.
DAD: Throw a ball.
JUSTIN: Got it.
You got it?
JUSTIN:
I got it. You're good.
Everybody wave.
Everybody wave.
Hi!
ZACK: Hey, Mom, will you
describe to me
how we inherited Matt?
How we inherited Matt?
What?
ZACK: Your unfortunate
inheritance that is Matt.
Matt's mother and I
worked together.
When you guys were
in the first grade,
that's when we
started working together.
LOIS: Good job, Zack.
And you've been
inseparable ever since.
Yeah! Score, score, score!
When you guys were
about nine or 10,
that's when Lois got sick,
and she'd been
receiving chemo,
and one day,
I was taking Lois home
from one of her appointments,
and she turned to me
with a tear in her eye
and she said,
"Take care of my little boy."
And she died
three weeks later.
DAD: Yeah.
That's how we have Matt.
She knew how much
we all loved him,
and your father
and I love Matt
as much as we love
you and Krysta.
All right, well,
I'll shoot for her.
Is it my shot?
Yes, it's your turn.
Well, nobody's
taking my shot for me.
Hey.
MATT:
I feel like Nicole has become,
like, part of the family.
Not like a mom or sister,
but, like, crazy aunt.
Yeah.
I mean,
even though two years
and our relationship
isn't as intimate
as other people's,
I know that nothing would
ever come between us.
Ever.
ZACK: I was taking a pee
the other day on C floor,
and two guys came in,
and they were
talking about Nicole.
MATT: All right.
This guy was like,
"I heard she did something
with some dude
at a college party."
It's funny.
It's really funny.
I'm not...
I'm not lying.
I'm putting you
on speakerphone.
Yeah, we just said...
(GIRL ON SPEAKERPHONE)
They were in bed and...
They got naked.
JUSTIN:
But it's just a rumor, man.
GIRL: That's what I heard.
JUSTIN: Remember last year
when everyone thought
I was moving to Canada?
Everybody believed it.
Could you
pull over, man?
I'll see you there.
Man...
JACOB: Try and keep
your head up, Matt.
You need a baseball bat?
ZACK:
Don't give him that!
(BOTH ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)
And she cheated on me!
Hey, I had a girlfriend,
too, all right?
We all go through this.
JUSTIN: Hey!
JUSTIN:
It's a rumor, man!
ZACK: We will find out
if it's real, okay?
Just call.
I just can't...
I can't picture her
doing this to me,
all right?
I know, I know.
But you need to call...
We were gonna
lose our virginities
to each other.
ZACK: Clearly,
she wasn't a virgin.
Get the fuck out.
ZACK: Okay, okay.
Slow down.
JUSTIN:
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys!
ZACK: Calm down!
Calm down!
JUSTIN:
Grab him, grab him.
JACOB: This is for your
own good, buddy.
Look at me. We'll get
to the bottom of it.
Okay.
Calm.
I got it.
You got it?
JACOB: Cool heads prevail.
ZACK: Okay, Matt.
I'm here to find out
if Nicole fucked that dude.
Excuse me.
Hey, are you Harry?
No, man.
I'm not Harry.
Oh, thank God.
(HARRY SPEAKING)
You know,
I did meet her I think.
She was at this party,
I do remember...
(ZACK SPEAKING)
I just need to know
if you fucked her.
(HARRY SPEAKING)
Hey, do you wanna
see a stripper?
HARRY:
We had a party
three days ago,
and she never left.
She's trying to
shake us down
for more money.
As soon as you give me
my $300, I'll leave.
No, we paid you
already, so...
ZACK: Hey, man.
Anyway, what was I...
We were talking
about Nicole.
STRIPPER: Thank you.
ZACK:
Dude, back to Nicole.
Hey, I got pickle
juice all over me now.
ZACK: Harry!
Are you happy?
I don't know who
they're talking about.
That better be
the best fucking pickle
you've ever had.
ZACK: Hey! Hey, Harry,
Harry, Harry. Can you...
Sorry, man. I just...
I need to know what
happened with Nicole.
Just tell your buddy
I'm sorry, okay?
ZACK: Dude, you gonna
have to tell him yourself.
Sure. How?
Just look into the camera.
Just like this?
Yeah.
(SIGHING)
Matt.
Matt. Matt.
I really am sorry
about what I did
with your girl.
Okay?
Okay.
What did you do?
I can't get into that.
That's frat policy.
Here's what I can say.
Matt, Nicole is
a very nice girl,
and she likes to party.
(SENTIMENTAL SONG PLAYING)
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)
MOM: Looks yummy. Cookies?
MATT: You used to make
cookies all the time...
DAD: They're good.
(MATT SNIFFLING)
Hey. Sweetheart,
what's the matter?
She cheated on me.
I'm sorry.
Hey, guess what?
Yeah.
I talked to your sister.
She's gonna
come here this weekend.
That's great.
ZACK: (MUMBLING)
These cookies are really good.
MOM: Zack, zip it!
Can't you just back off
for a little while?
Do you have to always
be in everybody's face
constantly?
ZACK: (MUMBLING)
I'm just trying to get this
so he'll realize
how silly he was later.
Yeah, I can't understand
anything you're saying
with your mouth full of food.
ZACK:
Your mouth... Uh!
ZACK: Hey, dick-munch!
Krys is here.
Grab the camera.
You got it?
JACOB: Yeah.
Hey, hey! Krys is here.
Krys is here. Heads up.
Hey!
Hey!
KRYSTA:
Hey, what's up?
How are you, lady?
Come on. No. Jesus!
Zack! Shit!
Zack, stop! You...
JACOB: Just so you know,
this is not my idea.
ZACK:
Out of the way!
That's for me!
KRYSTA: Hey! Stop!
Oh, my God.
Jacob, take the keys! No!
(KRYSTA SCREAMING)
ZACK: Yeah!
KRYSTA: You're such a...
ZACK: I'm such a dick!
Did you hear that?
Welcome home, honey.
Oh, my God.
Welcome home.
MATT: Krysta.
Want to dry off?
Thank you, Matt.
ZACK: Hey, dickhole!
Matt's the only
person in this whole house
that's nice to me.
Thank you.
Oh!
So wet and disgusting.
I know. I'm a wet girl.
Very athletic.
You've been
waiting for this for
however long that you guys
have been going out?
ZACK: Two years.
Two years.
You've been
waiting for this
for two years,
and now she
fucked somebody else?
ZACK:
You should go on that date
you were talking about.
Have sex with her there.
KRYSTA:
Go on the date.
Go do all the things,
and the carriage
and the flowers and the hotel,
and then have
sex with her.
You get all of
those feelings out,
and then you get
out of it unscathed.
I'm becoming
aroused, yes.
MATT: I don't want to
do that to her, though.
MATT: She meant
too much to me.
KRYSTA: Why not?
ZACK: There's no revenge.
It's just making it right.
His girlfriend
cheated on him.
Damn!
KRYSTA: Look, you get to pick
how this song ends, okay?
I think you're gonna
feel better if you do.
Hey, Nicole.
It's Matt. How are you?
Um...
I'm sorry I missed
your calls before.
I was feeling
kind of sick,
kind of ill.
But I'm much better,
and I can't wait
until Saturday.
I am very excited.
So, give me a call back.
All right, see you.
Did that sound phony?
That was fucking awesome.
What're you doing?
I'm calling it off.
MATT:
I just don't think
I can do it.
I don't love her
anymore, dude.
ZACK:
Sex isn't about love.
Sex is about sex!
Who's your
favorite porn star?
What does it matter?
Just tell me.
Sunny Leone.
Okay, close your eyes
and think about Nicole,
and visualize
her body, okay?
Put Sunny Leone's head
on her body.
That's someone
you love, right?
Sunny Leone, yes.
Have sex with her.
I'll try.
JACOB:
Nice fucking place, dude.
Good choice.
MATT: Thank you.
You got style.
I thought it would be,
like, a really romantic
setting for our first time.
Whatever, dude.
You're here now.
We're gonna make
the best of it.
You ready?
JUSTIN: Yeah, let's go.
I'm here to
check out the rooms
under the name "Matthew."
ZACK:
Matt, check how many rooms.
MATT: Two rooms.
Two rooms? Are y'all
gonna throw a party?
No. I'm not.
What?
This is a great place
to party.
JUSTIN: I'm very good.
INNKEEPER: Adjoining rooms.
JACOB: Very nice.
INNKEEPER:
Here's the other one.
ZACK:
Yeah, this is great!
JACOB: Very nice, sir.
Very nice indeed.
Wow! Yeah,
we get this room.
ZACK: Can you check
how sturdy it is, Jacob?
Yeah.
ZACK: Fuck on it.
Yeah!
Is that
a good fucking?
Jacob, is that the way
that you fuck?
It is when there's
no one to fuck.
I want y'all boys to know
all these beds
are up to snuff.
My wife and I have
tried out every bed
and couch and cot
in this whole hotel.
JACOB: Really?
JACOB: Your wife sounds
like a truly amazing woman.
INNKEEPER: Well,
she's got Alzheimer's,
and that's no fun
when you...
MATT: I'm sorry.
For sex.
JACOB: Yeah.
Anyway, I'll bring back
some champagne.
Excellent.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.
INNKEEPER:
I have a big...
Oh, my God, he's back.
I have a really
strong connection
with you guys,
and I don't know what it is,
and I hope we can be friends
for a long time.
JACOB: All right.
(LAUGHING)
Okay. All right.
I'll be seeing you.
Thanks, buddy.
Oh, my God.
Do not drink
anything he gives you.
ZACK: All right,
this is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna be fucking
over here. On the bed.
Then we are gonna be
over in this room,
and we're gonna
have speakers set up
all over the place
so we can all hear it.
Now, once you're done,
you're gonna knock twice,
so we'll be like...
Busted!
And you're gonna
break up with her
on film.
Okay.
I'm so happy
you're doing this.
Okay, could you just give me
a little bit of room?
Guys.
JACOB: Yeah, no problem.
JACOB:
All right, man. Come on.
We need to set up
how I'm gonna, like,
tape shit down.
Do you think I should
really do this?
ZACK: Yes.
She cheated on you.
Remember that. Okay?
Okay.
Hey, Matty, Zack.
Hey, sir.
ZACK: Hey!
How are you today?
Good, good, good.
Why are you
so dressed up?
Well, you know,
it's our anniversary,
so I just wanted to...
Your anniversary of what?
We're going out.
Nothing. Just...
Please. Please don't.
No.
No, I couldn't.
Here we are.
Here, just take it.
I don't feel right.
It's not for you, Matt.
It's for my daughter,
all right?
Let me show you
something.
There it goes.
Forty miles an hour!
Here, now drink a glass
of this, and tell me...
ZACK:
Matt, don't drink that.
NICOLE'S DAD:
Go ahead, go ahead.
What do you think?
Frothy. It's...
It's definitely...
ZACK: Oh, my God.
That's a really good...
ZACK:
Does that shit turn
you into the Hulk?
It's good.
NICOLE'S DAD:
Is she beautiful or what?
MATT: Very beautiful.
(EXCLAIMING)
Hey. You look great.
NICOLE: Thanks.
Hubba-hubba.
NICOLE'S DAD:
Well, listen. Y'all have
a good time tonight.
MATT: Thank you, sir.
NICOLE'S DAD: Call me if you
need anything, all right?
You look great.
NICOLE'S DAD:
You look fantastic.
Y'all have a good time.
Bye, bye. I love you.
ZACK: I love you,
too, David.
Are you excited?
Uh. Yeah.
Can't wait. After all
the planning and secrecy.
Yeah, I know.
ZACK: Oh!
You guys are so cute.
I cannot wait to
hear how this goes.
Bye.
You're fucking like this.
You see a fucking mike!
Let's just put
it in her vagina.
Can you hear that?
Squeaking?
(BED SQUEAKING)
Is it, like, white noise,
or does it sound
like they're fucking?
No, no.
It's clear as fuck.
(BLOW-DRYER WHIRRING)
Test, test.
"Oh, baby,
that's the wrong hole."
Sounds good.
ZACK: This one is perfect.
If she squirts,
we're gonna hear it.
Come on, let's go.
For you.
All right.
Should I pop this or
should you pop this?
Let them pop it.
This is gonna be so good!
This is so good!
This is, like,
the peak of our genius.
We got it!
(VOCALIZING)
Hey! Hey, you want
to see me jump over...
♪ Matt's gonna get fucked ♪
Hell, yeah!
Jump over this.
(ALL CHEERING)
Nice, nice.
Don't watch me
while I do that.
That's me time.
All right, guys.
So what's happening
is we're gonna
fucking make Nicole
feel like
the bitch she is.
Bitch. Slut, whore.
Slut.
ZACK: And then fucking
break it online.
Hell, no!
ZACK: Who's excited for
Matt losing his virginity?
Whoo! Yeah!
Can we go
check the mikes?
JACOB: Checking.
We're by the bed.
Can you hear this?
We're having sex now.
This is so much fun.
Oh, my God.
(JACOB MOANING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Shut up! Shut up, guys.
Guys, shut the fuck up.
Hey, Matt.
Hey, man.
What are you talking about?
Yes. Yes. Are you almost here?
No. Nicole...
Then that's perfect.
Okay, okay, okay. Hey, guys,
they're leaving right now.
NICOLE: Champagne?
That's so sweet.
(RATTLING)
To us.
MATT: Cheers.
Do you want to
take a shower with me?
See, actually,
I'm good right now.
I just actually...
I took a shower.
Come on.
I hate... I hate him.
Fuck.
Hey. Get these off.
Okay.
What?
Is everything okay?
Fine.
Maybe you're
trying too hard?
Oh, no!
Dude, he can't get it up.
Do you want...
How about you lie down?
Let me take care of you.
Oh, my God.
Can you hold that thought?
I have to run to
the bathroom really fast.
Okay.
Okay. Really fast.
Just one minute.
Is he...
He's jacking off.
No, we'd hear it. Shh.
I hear nothing.
What's going on?
Fuck.
(MATT FARTING)
Oh!
Oh, no.
What did they eat
at the...
Oh! Poor guy.
(CONTINUES FARTING)
Oh, my God.
That's a problem.
That's a machine gun.
(DOOR OPENING)
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Actually not.
I have to go back...
I have to go back
to the bathroom.
Oh, my God.
He's not done.
(MATT FARTING)
Oh, my God.
That's what they
call a dirty job.
It doesn't get
nastier than that.
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with him?
He could
burn his asshole.
(NICOLE CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY)
What's wrong?
Fuck this.
This is wrong.
What do you mean?
What are you
talking about?
(DOOR BANGING)
Oh! Shit!
Open!
ZACK: No comprende.
I am from Mexico.
Is that Zack?
All right, Zack, come on.
I can't do it.
Hello.
What the fuck?
Nicole, where you going?
I just want to tell you,
you look beautiful.
Nicole, stop.
...and he says
if I win this one,
I get to suck on your tits.
I know that what
I did was stupid, okay?
But I didn't fuck him.
And I was drunk,
and I know that
if I wasn't drunk
I wouldn't have let it happen,
but it just seemed
like it wasn't so bad.
I put two years
into this relationship,
and I thought it was going...
It was working very well.
And you fucked it up.
Okay?
I know that I fucked up,
but, like, what is
this with all the cameras?
Like,
are you fucking kidding me?
Like, you would do that to me?
I didn't do
anything on purpose
just to hurt you.
You're doing this on purpose
just to hurt me, Matt.
(GASPS)
It's over, Nicole.
I'm breaking up
with you, all right?
It's done.
I get it.
I get it, Matt.
Do you?
ZACK: Matt, kick his ass.
Fuck you, old man!
Kick his ass, Matt!
MATT: Ow! Oh!
(ALL LAUGHING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
MATT: Why the fuck
would you post this?
I look like an idiot.
It's you in the video.
MATT:
What's funny about it?
ZACK: Everyone thought
she fucked Harry.
She just got
her tits sucked!
Matt. What's that?
What? What are you doing?
ZACK:
Some Asian dude responded.
Hi, Matt.
What you did to that girl?
It disgust me!
All she wanted to do
was get her titties sucked.
Like this.
(MOANS) Suck it, baby.
(ALL LAUGHING)
MATT: Maybe, you know,
maybe I need to grow up,
maybe I'm a bit of a baby,
but at least
I'm not a cheater, you know?
Right?
Good way to look at it.
ZACK: Sure, dude.
DAD: Hey!
MOM: Take a bite.
ZACK: Seth,
when did you start balding?
When did I start balding?
When I was 22.
ZACK: Matt, you're gonna
start balding at 22.
MOM: No. Matt has
a great head of hair.
I think I get it
from my mom.
MOM: Yes.
SETH: Look it, I got
something kind of special.
A little something for you.
Check it out.
Is there something I'm...
It's a sobriety chip.
ZACK: Is that a poker chip?
It's a sobriety chip.
No, that's a sobriety
chip, man.
That's amazing.
It's six months?
ZACK: You got a sobriety chip?
Yeah, absolutely.
MATT: I'm proud of you.
Thanks, Matt.
It's been hard.
Did it for you.
DAD: Happy birthday.
Here's a six-month chip.
Wow!
How many months
do you have?
Who wants more cake?
I'll have some.
SETH: Dude, dude, dude.
It's a big deal, you know?
DAD: He's a good kid.
Thank you.
In spite of the fact that
you're his dad. Father.
That's kind of un-cool,
but whatever.
Yeah, I know,
I'm real un-cool.
He didn't have to come.
At least he made the effort.
DAD: (SCOFFING) Yeah.
I love you.
Yeah, I can do that.
ZACK: I got you something.
MOM:
Oh, Zack, that's sweet!
Panties?
DAD: What the heck is that?
ZACK:
They're Sunny Leone's.
MOM: Sunny Leone?
Who's...
These are Sunny
Leone's panties?
ZACK: Yeah.
SETH: Who's Sunny Leone?
ZACK: Dude, open the...
It's your son's
favorite actress.
DAD: She's an
adult film star.
MOM: Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.
ZACK:
That's her wearing them.
Show the picture.
DAD: Oh, my God!
"This is to attest
to the fact that
these panties
"are genuine
Sunny Leone panties,
"as worn by Sunny herself.
This is awarded to Matt."
Signed by Sunny.
DAD: Couldn't you
have just gotten him
an autographed
baseball or something?
ZACK: Matt?
It's good.
It's a good present.
Thanks, man.
ZACK:
Time to wake up, dirt bag!
MATT: No!
It's your lucky day.
Do you always have a boner?
What the fuck
is that, dude?
MATT: Morning wood.
It's called morning wood.
ZACK: Dude,
I've got the biggest surprise
you've ever seen in your life.
Click on the video.
Hi, my name's Becca.
I saw a video yesterday
called "Matt's Big Night,"
and Matt, if you see this,
I want to make you an offer.
I thought that it
was pretty shitty
what happened with
your ex-girlfriend,
and I thought I'd offer
myself to your cause.
I want to be your first.
So I'm 25.
I'm very sexual,
very experienced woman,
and I'm also a direct
descendant of Cleopatra,
and I'm 100% confident saying
I embody her sensuality.
I hope that you contact me
and we could
take this further,
and I promise
you won't regret it.
All right, thanks.
ZACK:
Fucking awesome.
No way.
Yeah.
No.
You're such a fucking idiot.
I can't do it.
I don't want to
fuck a stranger.
Why not?
Strangers kill
other strangers.
Strangers also
blow other strangers.
You're not making sense.
Maybe this lady is,
like, your long lost love,
and you guys were
meant to be together.
This is exactly
why God invented
the Internet.
No, he invented
the Internet for porn.
How is this not porn?
This is porn
that comes home.
Porn is safe!
Having sex leads to babies,
leads to STDs...
Dude, porn is
your last priority...
...leads to commitment,
marriage.
...and me walking in.
Okay? That's what porn is.
Porn is me seeing
you every day, sad.
Okay, I know
this isn't your thing,
but you really need
something to help you
forget about Nicole.
I mean, it's
whatever you decide, okay?
It's up to you.
I don't even know
anything about her.
Not yet you don't.
(ALL LAUGHING)
ZACK: Okay, guys,
this is a phone conversation
between Becca and her doctor.
DOCTOR: TB, HIV, syphilis,
gonorrhea, chlamydia,
all negative.
You have no
transmittable diseases
of any kind.
BECCA: Good.
You do, however,
have high cholesterol.
That's something
we should maybe talk
about getting you...
JACOB:
It's no big deal, right?
That doesn't affect...
JUSTIN:
It's pretty hot, actually.
BECCA: Remember Matt?
I told you about that guy?
Yeah.
He's losing his virginity.
He's nervous.
He's worried. Tell him
what I'm like in bed.
If this is your first time,
and it's gonna be with her,
you're the luckiest guy
in the world.
She'll get on top of you
and throw you around
like a rag doll,
which is something
that most men love.
She's just like...
She's like a stripper.
Like, arms, legs, tongue.
It's fucking amazing.
"Hey, Becca, it's Matt.
"Please send me
some naked photos."
"Why?" She wants to know why.
MATT: I don't know.
"To make sure you
are without penis."
I think that's good.
BECCA: Yeah, is there
anything else that you can say
to help young Matt
feel more
comfortable, maybe?
DOCTOR: Well, in addition to
being disease-free,
you're on birth control,
so the risk of pregnancy
is very low,
and, Matt should feel good
about that as well.
ZACK: What more
could you ask for?
You're not going to
find many other girls
who don't have diseases.
What the fuck!
MATT: What...
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Enlarge it, enlarge it.
ZACK: There's her vagina.
She has a vagina.
"Well, are we going
to do this or not?
Last chance."
It's up to you, pal.
All right.
Good night.
Have a happy...
Good night.
She wants me to buy a suit.
Ralph Lauren, Black Label.
She said if
I want to fuck like a man,
I have to dress like a man.
ZACK: I get that.
God!
I'm actually
gonna do this.
Hey, I need to get a suit.
Ralph Lauren, Black Label.
Sure, this way.
Okay.
You're, like, a 36?
I guess so.
Okay. So,
this is a Black Label suit.
And they usually run in the...
This one's $1,795.
And that's
the price point right there
for Black Label suit.
Seventeen...
$1,700.
Becca, I want to go for it,
but it's all just super,
super expensive,
and if we could just
not worry about this...
Yeah. I understand.
I got you.
All right, see you. Bye.
ZACK: What did she say?
She said,
"No suit, no sex."
ZACK: So we'll
get you the suit.
It's not the end
of the world
that I'm not gonna
have sex with Becca.
I've never met
a single girl...
ZACK: Look at me.
What?
After that.
I mean, come on, dude.
ZACK: It's not like you
don't have the money.
I don't have the money.
ZACK: You have a college fund
that's overflowing with money.
Your mom would
want you to do this.
Matt, this is your last tape,
and I just
wanted to let you know
that I've put away
a little money for you.
I hope it will
help with college
and make your life just
a little easier, okay?
I wish I could be
at your graduation.
I'm really proud of you.
I love you.
Sir, it looks
as if your account
has been liquidated.
MATT: That's...
That's impossible.
I mean, nobody has
access to my account.
MATT:
So, I went to take money
out of my bank account,
and apparently
my dad had cleaned out
all my funds for college.
KRYSTA: Oh, my God.
Poor Matt.
I'm so sorry.
Maybe we should
call the cops.
I don't want to
have him arrested.
ZACK: Maybe you should
just punch him in the face
and ask for the money back.
Okay, yeah, that's
gonna do a lot of good.
Let's just punch
people in the face.
Why don't you just
call him? Maybe...
He's on this path to recovery.
Maybe he'll give it back.
Well, he doesn't
have a phone.
He's living in
the swamps right now.
Well, then, let's go.
In the swamps?
Yeah.
Can we go there?
Let's go.
Well, I'll confront him,
and we will talk about it.
I think that's a great idea.
I'd like to see you
confront someone.
There he is, right there.
All right, Zack, ready?
Come on!
Come on!
JUSTIN:
Road trip, motherfucker!
ZACK:
Get the fuck in the car,
you fucker!
All right, drive.
Drive!
KRYSTA: Go!
ZACK: Everybody wave.
Say hello to that guy.
We're going!
Where am I going?
(MATT SPEAKING)
Nicole keeps texting me.
(KRYSTA SPEAKING)
Are you going to talk to her?
I don't think I should.
I'm trying to think
more in the moment,
and right now,
I need to stop
thinking about Nicole
and start
thinking about Becca.
I understand that.
Some of the best sex
I've ever had is with
people I don't know.
That's really sketchy.
It's true!
Who wants water gators?
What in God's name is this?
Ow! Oh, what the fuck?
KRYSTA: Get excited, man.
There's nothing more fun
than something
a little wrong.
And what you're doing
is so fucking wrong
that it's awesome.
Before you know it,
you're doing shit you
would have never imagined.
JUSTIN: Snooker Island?
MATT: Do you know where
Snooker Island is?
Untie this little
rope around here.
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit.
You ain't going nowhere.
(BOAT ENGINE WHIRRING)
MATT: Hey, Dad.
Hey, hey.
What's up, Matt?
How's it going there?
Loving it?
You loving this baby?
SETH: So, I kind of
put some extra care
into outfitting it.
I'm just so grateful
to have this in my life.
It's the only thing
that I have that's mine,
you know?
But someday
it'll be yours.
Thank you.
Dad, do you have a minute
that we can go
talk in private?
Yeah.
TINA: I'm sorry.
Are you saying
I stole money?
(STUTTERS)
I wasn't talking to you.
I was...
TINA: Did you do this?
SETH: Um...
TINA:
What are you? A moron?
SETH: No.
TINA: You know something
about your dad?
I don't know
if you know this
or not,
but your dad is
a little bitch.
Did you know that?
You probably
do know that,
'cause you lived
with him for a while.
If people weren't here...
Just fucking get that
shit out of my face.
MATT: We came all the way
out here just for that,
and I...
Do I look like a bank?
I mean,
I can't press a button
and money's gonna
just fucking pop
out of nowhere.
You could, you know,
have some compassion for me
and stuff like that.
I mean...
I have plenty of
compassion for you.
Can I just
say something?
I just wanted you to
know that, you know,
the person who did
whatever it is
that you think I did
was not really me,
'cause that was a person
who was on drugs who did that.
So, let me get...
Are you using drugs
right now?
No, of course
I'm not using drugs.
You're clearheaded?
Yeah. No. I mean,
yeah. Absolutely.
And you have no intention
of paying me back?
Well, I'm
a drug addict, man.
ZACK: Matt, let's get
the fuck out of here.
All right,
you guys ready?
KRYSTA:
Wait, Matt,
where you going?
(KRYSTA LAUGHING)
That was awesome.
KRYSTA:
Thanks for nothing, dickwad!
ZACK: Matt,
let's go get drunk.
MATT: Yeah.
Party's all inside.
Bring us a beer
on your way out.
Okay.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
I want to grow up to be him.
Hey! Who has a match?
Who has a match?
Smoking's bad.
Smoking's bad.
(GUITAR PLAYING)
(SINGING)
You're so good.
Oh, thank you.
You're good.
ZACK: Hey.
You guys into
incense porn?
Incense?
KRYSTA:
Zack, stop it! Stop it!
ZACK: Incest porn?
You guys into
incest porn?
Like you've never
gotten a boner off of me.
Like you've never
seen me in the buff.
I've never gotten your...
What the fuck?
JACOB: I have.
KRYSTA: Thank you, Jacob.
JUSTIN:
Zack, why are you
so upset, buddy?
I mean, think about it,
now. Be honest.
They're not really
brother and sister.
They're not related.
It's not like
you and Krysta.
But they're my
brother and sister.
But they're not related.
Admit it.
They're not really
brother and sister.
There's no blood
shared there.
(ZACK COUGHING)
That is why
I wouldn't make out
with my brother and Krysta.
JUSTIN: Fuck. Jesus!
(JACOB LAUGHING)
Write...
JACOB: (WHISPERS) Nice.
(JUSTIN CHUCKLING)
Justin.
What?
I think Matt and Krysta
are hooking up.
(MATT AND KRYSTA CHUCKLING)
Zack.
ZACK:
Oh, what the fuck?
JACOB: Just get up.
Look, there's something
you gotta see.
Did someone die?
JACOB:
There's a situation.
(MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY)
No, no,
don't go that way.
Zack, come here,
come here,
come here, come here.
Just open up that tent.
What...
Shh.
This is pathetic.
She's still sleeping.
It's not funny.
KRYSTA: Stop it.
Why are you guys naked?
Oh, no, no, no. Matt, out.
Hey. Now.
Get out of here.
JACOB:
Everybody calm down.
(JUSTIN LAUGHING)
JACOB: It's all good.
(LAUGHTER)
JACOB: It's all good!
Whoa! Whoa!
Other tent.
Now. I'm serious.
I will fucking hit you.
KRYSTA: Mind your own
fucking business.
ZACK: I'm sorry?
Yes! Mind your
own business!
JUSTIN: Good night, Matt.
ZACK: And Krysta.
KRYSTA: What? Stop it.
I'm very
disappointed in you.
Well, I can do
whatever the fuck I want.
ZACK: I don't think
you want to fuck Matt.
ZACK: Krysta?
KRYSTA: What?
Can we
make a new rule?
No more attempted
sibling sex?
Deal.
Hey, just so you know,
I was really drunk last night.
That's... It's not ever
gonna happen again.
I... Yeah, I...
I understand. It's cool.
Listen.
You're not gonna
lose your virginity
with me, okay?
ZACK: Get up, baby.
We're gonna get you that suit.
Yeah.
(MATT SPEAKING)
(MATT SPEAKING)
MATT: Sorry, dude.
ZACK: Dude, everybody's
in the position.
Ready to go.
Are you ready?
JACOB: Hey, dude. Okay.
JUSTIN: Don't even worry.
ZACK: The guy out front
goes on break right now.
I look okay?
ZACK: You look like
a child pornographer.
Thanks.
MATT: How can I sustain
$40,000 right now?
I'm not a fucking bank!
Dumb motherfucker!
I'm gonna start counting.
I get to three,
one, two, three...
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Fuck! We're dead!
Sorry.

completely honest right now.
I thought you were
gonna fucking pussy out.
You did so good, dude.
It was fucking awesome.
MATT: I... I don't know.
I've... I've never...
(SIGHS) I've never felt
anything like this before.
What?
MATT: Not even when
I was with Nicole, man.
I've... I've never
felt this close to...
To having sex.
ZACK: I'm excited for you.
MATT: Thanks, man.
ZACK: Hey, Becca.
Becca. Wow!
BECCA: What's going on?
How you doing?
You look even prettier...
You look even prettier than...
Than the pictures
that you sent.
You're prettier in real life.
Oh. Thank you.
I like your glasses.
Hi, honey! How are you?
Hey, little guy.
That's my son, Renner.
Can you say hi, Renner?
Son?
Hi.
Renner, you remember...
Do you remember
Matt from the video?
You showed him my video?
Is this the guy
that had diarrhea?
Yes, I did have
diarrhea once.
Sure. Renner,
do you want a photo?
Okay.
Okay. All right.
You ready? Say cheese.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
ZACK: You guys look great.
You look like a family.
ZACK: Hey, Renner,
have you ever seen
your mom naked? I have.
So, I will
see you tomorrow.
Okay.
All right, great.
So, I'll just get a...
Sounds good.
I'm gonna give you this.
Oh. Thank you.
There's that.
Just a...
Thank you.
I'll see you.
I could be a dad.
It says, "Please be showered,
shaved, and no pubic hair."
ZACK: Holy shit.
I mean, we talked
about it a little bit.
She said pubic hair,
you know, prevents people
from getting as deep
as... You know,
as possible.
ZACK: Then do it.
I'm kind of...
I have butterflies
in my stomach right now.
ZACK: You should have
butterflies in your penis.
I feel... I feel...
I feel happier than I have
since I broke up with Nicole.
High-five.
Kickflip.
ZACK: You need to control
every single thing
that happens in that room.
Not only will it
make you feel better,
it's gonna turn her on.
I would actually
be more comfortable
if I didn't have
to be in control.
I like letting it...
ZACK: I would be
more comfortable
if my brother
wasn't an old woman.
Shall we check
further along?
ZACK: Dude,
you're being a pussy.
Slightly, yes.
I mean, very slightly.
I don't know where
to begin with her, though.
What do I say? What do I...
You say...
You say anything
you want to say.
You have no
reason to freak out.
MATT: I... I'm... I'm...
I'm thinking of all
the possibilities.
She could,
you know, get on top,
take the initiative,
and, you know, just...
Just be a man for...
Just this once.
ZACK:
You need to grow
a pair of balls.
I have balls.
Fucking give it to her.
I have the balls
to give it to her.
She's gonna fuck
your brains out.
Yeah.
MATT:
Oh, that's gonna hurt.
ZACK: All right,
I got a razor, buddy.
You ready?
Such a... This is, like,
the weirdest situation
I've ever been in.
Let's do this.
(ZACK LAUGHING)
Why is that funny?
It's not a massage.
You rub it around
the fucking hairy parts,
not your whole dick,
you weirdo.
Just keep shaving, man.
MATT:
It's tedious work, dude.
You're not really
getting very much off.
Can't see
what I'm doing.
Just push hard.
Push harder.
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)
Hey, you got this.
You're golden.
I can't do it.
Yes, you can, dude.
Get up.
You can do this.
I can't.
Yeah, I'll do it with you.
Could you?
'Cause I really can't.
No, my hands are
shaking too much.
So, when you're
fucking her tonight,
you know what you should say?
I was thinking about this
last week. You should say,
"Girl,
I'm gonna fuck the taste
right out of your mouth."
No. No, I'm not
saying that to anyone.
It's classy.
It's not classy.
It's very classy.
That's something...
That's like holding
the door for a woman.
Saying that I want
to fuck the taste
out of the woman?
Absolutely.
I am good at this.
ZACK:
You ready? This is it.
Let's go.
MATT: Becca?
Becca!
Hey!
The lock is messed up.
I'll lower a key to you.
Okay.
Got it.
BECCA:
Okay, come on up.
Wow.
You look fantastic.
Got you these flowers.
They look great.
Thanks.
(BECCA SPEAKING)
So, see you later.
ZACK: All right.
Thanks, dude.
I can take it from here.
Okay, bye.
ZACK: Bye. I'll see you
guys later. Have fun.
Bye, Zack.
ZACK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was just finding
the stairs.
I found them.
They're here.
BECCA: Your suit's nice.
You look good.
I jacked off twice today
thinking about you.
MATT: Oh! Yeah,
you know, right back at you.
I've just been, like, 24-7.
That's flattering.
Did you do everything
that I asked you to do?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.
Clothes off.
Mmm? Sorry?
Take your...
Take your clothes off.
Let's see. I mean, you know.
How was your day?
It was good. Good.
Yeah?
All right. Come on in.
Have a seat on my bed.
Little champagne? No?
Don't have any.
So, what do you
want to do to me?
Good sex requires
good communication.
All right, what if
I started off with...
Massaging your shoulders.
Okay, that's...
That's a good start.
And...
What else?
I'm not sure.
That's all...
That's all for right now.
That's all
I can think of.
Okay. That's...
That's what you
fantasize about 24-7,
jacking off to massaging?
Massaging my shoulders?
Yeah, but then,
whatever happens, happens.
Right? You know?
Goes from there
to the lower back
to the buttocks.
Yeah. You know what?
I'm not really getting
hot from that. Sorry.
No, wait, no.
Okay, what if
after all that,
I fuck the taste
out of your mouth.
That's good?
What? What...
Okay. Tell me,
why would I need the taste
fucked out of my mouth?
I don't...
What does that mean?
(STUTTERS)
Well, I... If you need...
lf, like... I don't know.
Do you think
that I need the taste
fucked out of my mouth?
I don't think... No.
I don't think you need it.
I'm just saying that
maybe it's, like, a...
No.
No.
Just forget I said it.
Let's start at the beginning.
Sorry.
Okay, you know what
we're gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
Have you ever
gone down on a girl?
Given a girl head?
I mean, I got really close.
It was, like,
inches away from my face.
Okay. Yeah.
Well, that's where
we're gonna start.
Okay.
Bend over here,
and we're just gonna
pretend that this is me.
That's...
That has a penis.
BECCA: So, yeah.
Just follow me over here.
She can just lay right here.
And, you know,
we're just gonna
start from the basics.
Okay, if you need
some support,
pretend that
the asshole is a pussy.
If you need to.
Get on your knees first.
On your knees.
On your knees.
Okay, take her legs up.
There you go.
Pretend...
Pretend that's me.
All right.
Yeah. There you go.
Now, just start kissing.
There you go.
Now, take your hand
and move it to
the inside of her leg.
Yeah? It's a little
happy spot, just the top.
Lick and caress me.
How does that feel?
KRYSTA: Oh, my God.
ZACK: Don't fucking laugh.
That's not funny.
You like that?
You just gotta
stay with that for...
JACOB: I've seen enough.
Can we please
turn it off, now?
ZACK:
Wait. It gets worse.
Hi, my name
is not actually Becca.
My real name is Kelly.
Becca was a persona
that I created
for my graduate
thesis this year
on the simplicity of men.
I never returned
to the loft last night.
Matt was so desperate for sex
and had so little self-respect
that he waited for my return
for 162 minutes.
None of my other test subjects
waited for more than 50.

Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maine, Maryland.

He's not really my kid.
Thank you.
ZACK:
How did we miss this?
KRYSTA:
He looks like an idiot.
Yeah, that's...
That's his own fault!
Is it his own fault?
Yeah, I didn't tell him
to eat out
a fucking tranny doll!
Yeah, well,
you told him...
He waited around
for 162 minutes.
What...
You told him!
Because he's a guy!
He doesn't know how
to deal with women.
His fault.
You told Matt to have sex
with a girl on the Internet.
Low on the
priority list right now.
You're appalled?
You're appalled?
I... I am
absolutely disgusted.
You have a camera
attached to you
at all times.
Yeah, man. This is true.
This is what
you are doing.
Jesus.
Where's the camera?
Right there.
MATT: No!
Oh, fuck!
I told you not
to show anybody!
Where did you come from?
Guys, stop it.
Fight like men!
My God!
ZACK: Matt, why the fuck
are you so mad?
MATT: Because you
ruined my life!
ZACK: No, I didn't!
You were just Rickrolled!
Calm down!
You're just Chocolate Rain!
This will pass!
Matty? Can we come in?
MOM:
Maybe he just needs
some time to sort things out.
ZACK: You can't let him
just sleep all day.
DAD: He won't show his
face over there anymore.
Can you blame him?
Good Lord,
what that girl did to him.
MOM: Well, you know,
the school year's almost over,
so maybe he can
just get his GED.
ZACK: Matt! Come on!
JUSTIN:
Matt, come in the pool, man.
No.
This is how you have sex.
You have to have your whole
body on the inside.
Matthew.
Stop it. Stop!
ZACK: Dude, what the fuck?
MAN:
Matt, you can fuck
the taste out of my mouth!
I'm a descendent of Cleopatra.
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
This video is
fucking bullshit,
that you fucking give men
a fucking bad name, Matt.
I don't care how big
of a fucking nerd Matt is.
Matt, you're a fucking nerd,
and you know it!
You're licking the fucking ass
of a fucking male...
What the fuck?
Do you want to
explain these dolls to me?
ZACK: Well...
Jesus Christ, Mom!
ZACK: Hey, Matt?
You know I'm sorry, right?
Dude, come on!
Dude, they're my muffins!
ZACK:
This isn't even my fault.
Maybe you should
stop feeling sorry
for yourself
and get off your ass
and do something.
That's easy for
you to say, man.
You don't have a dead mother
and a prick father.
You have two wonderful parents
who do whatever
you ask them to do.
They're your
parents, too!
They're not my parents.
They're just two people
who took pity on me
because their
own biological son
was such a fuckup
that he should
have been aborted
the second he was conceived.
You know what?
That's not nice.
So, fuck you,
and fuck your muffins.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
ZACK:
Everyone say "suck it!"
Suck it!
Suck it!
ZACK:
What the fuck?
Wait, wait, come back.
We have to rap.
JACOB: Oh, fuck!
ZACK: Fuck-you cam!
Why do you always fucking
bring the camera around?
It's so fucking gay!
ZACK: Fuck-you cam!
Fuck-you cam!
ALL (CHANTING)
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
That's my hat.
When did you get my hat?
ZACK: It's a nice hat.
Yeah, you're fucking...
Matt can talk to me himself.
He's not going to.
He hasn't left his
room in two weeks.
Well, that's his fault.
I couldn't fix it.
You fucking
cheated on Matt.
I think he's so insecure
that his heart is so broken
that he's never gonna
be able to forgive me,
and it's never gonna work.
JUSTIN: So, Nicole,
why haven't you
and Matt had sex yet?
Ask him.
No, I'm gonna ask you.
It's okay. I...
You know, it's my fault.
I just want it all
to be perfect.
It's gonna be perfect.
I don't know why
you worry about it so much.
Can we just change
the subject, please?
(SIGHS)
JUSTIN: Yeah.
I just don't want
to complicate it,
you know?
Yeah.
JUSTIN:
Nicole, do you think Matt's
over-thinking this?
Yes. Absolutely.
JACOB: Yeah.
JUSTIN: You're just,
like, get it out of the way.
Yeah.
ZACK: Matt has fallen ill
with two acute
medical conditions.
Blue balls and a broken heart.
And my associate, Jacob, and I
have found a way to
cure this problem.
With all the bad shit
that Matt's been through,
this is the perfect way
to turn his frown upside down
and just get him fucked.
Yeah. I completely agree.
There we go.
There she is. Sunny Leone.
We spoke to Sunny,
we agreed on a price,
and now we just need
to raise the money.
The one thing is,
she's also very expensive.
We both really
want him to be happy,
and I think this is
one of the only ways,
if not the only way,
this is actually gonna happen,
so we have to get
the money together
to get this girl to
just fuck his brains out,
and hopefully he'll
just shit the stick
right out of his ass.
It'd be good for him.
ZACK: Not bad.
We need you all to
look as attractive
as you possibly can.
JUSTIN:
Which isn't very hard.
Car wash! Whoo!
Would you like
some chocolate?
We're raising money
for our friend Matt.
He's a virgin,
and we're trying to...
...hire his favorite
pornographic film star...
You know, Sunny Leone...
Do you know who
Sunny Leone is?
JUSTIN: To spend
some time with him,
if you know what I mean.
We want to get him laid.
ZACK: Happy Christmas!
A friend is losing his
virginity to a porn star,
and I'm hiring her,
so I need some money.
All right,
how much is a chocolate?
No, I'm not...
Let me see if
I got something.
ZACK: All right. That's
what I'm talking about.
Come on.
No, no, it's for the...
It's for the kid.
Don't!
Are you kidding me?
Twenty.
Five dollars.
Happy Christmas!
(EXCLAIMING)
(SCREAMING)
Have you ever lost
your virginities?
You want to meet my friend?
ZACK: We raised all the money.
Now the only problem
is getting Matt
out of the house.
JACOB: That's the goal.
JUSTIN: What's going on?
ZACK: Matt won't come
out of his room,
so we're about to get Jacob
some army clothes.
JUSTIN: You're actually
going to join the army?
Absolutely.
JUSTIN: Really?
No, no.
I'm just gonna give him
some initiative to
get out of the house
and do something,
so he can get his
life back together.
ZACK: If he doesn't
come out for that,
that's the straw, bro.
I think he'll do it.
JACOB: Yeah.
JACOB: Where are most
of the uniforms?
Fucker!
JUSTIN: Oh, hello!
I'm liking these.
ZACK: Exactly.
JUSTIN: Dude,
that's a boy scout uniform.
JUSTIN: Ooh! Hello!
ZACK: I like black.

JUSTIN: I just want

up the butt right now.
Put the sailor hat on.

I'm here.
ZACK: Everybody ready?
All right, ladies.
Fuck that. Come on.
JACOB: This is very,
very important.
I can't believe
you joined the army.
Hey, buddy. I'm really
going to miss you, bro.
You know, if I don't
do it, who will?
Do I want to die?
No. Of course not.
Do I want to
kill somebody?
Fuck, yeah.
JUSTIN: Hook me up, Zack.
MATT: Dude, you know
where you're going yet?
Yeah,
I'm going all over the place.
I'm going all over the world.
I mean, fucking many places.
I'm doing a full 10, 12...
I'm gonna do
a 15-year tour.
After I ship out,
we might never
hang out again.
That's why
tonight we're gonna have
the best night of our lives.
JUSTIN: Fucking-A.
Yeah, let's make
a to... Okay.
Fuck toasts.
I'll pour another one,

Let's do it.

We're on the VIP comp sheet.

Okay. Let's go.

ladies and gentlemen,
this is what you've
been waiting for, boys.
Very special treat
for you on the stage
is triple-X superstar,
the Vivid contract girl.
You might have
seen her in such films
as Dark Side of Sunny,
It's Sunny in Brazil,
and Sunny & Cher.
Guys, coming up
here on the main stage.
Let's give a huge,
warm welcome
to the one and only
Miss Sunny Leone!
(CROWD CLAPPING)

Leave the camera off.

It's off. It's off. It's off.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are looking
for that big
round of applause.
People, put those
hands together right now.
Better make some noise.
That is Sunny Leone herself,
stepping down
on to the main stage
for you there.
It doesn't get
any better than that.
(ZACK SPEAKING)
It's time to meet Sunny.
What?
JACOB: Let's go!
JACOB: Matt, we fucking
hooked you up.
JUSTIN:
Hooked you up.
MATT: I don't understand.
JACOB: Dude, we got...
We got you something that's,
like, fucking insane.
ZACK: I don't know
how to explain it.
JACOB: It's nothing
but good things.
ZACK: Hey. Um...
Does it mean...
No. Fuck it.
JUSTIN: Come on, dude.
ZACK: Just be yourself.
Hi.
How's it going, guys?
Hi, Matt.
It's really nice
to meet you.
It's nice to meet you.
ZACK:
Sunny, anytime I walk in
on Matt masturbating...
(LAUGHS)
Aw.
It's true.
It's nice.
I'm glad I can
help you out.
Thank you.
Did you guys
like the show?
Yes. Yes.
ZACK: It was amazing.
You were great.
Poignant.
JACOB: Could I have
one of these DVDs?
SUNNY:
Do you got $20, sailor?
No. I don't even
have any pockets.
Then you gotta
put it back down.
SUNNY: Well,
I'm going to get undressed
and re-dressed,
and I'll see you in
a couple of minutes.
All right. Okay.
You guys are awesome.
SUNNY:
Little cute boy.
Oh, my God.
This is, like, the
Millennium Falcon of buses.
What's up, guys?
Come on in.
Hey.
SUNNY: Hi. This is my
boyfriend, Dirty.
JUSTIN: Dirty.
JACOB: What's up?
Pleasure to meet you.
MATT: Hey, Dirty.
Heard about
your shitty situation
with your girl. Sucks.
Thanks, man.
I wrote you something.
I want to play it for you.
You know, give a listen.

I appreciate the song.
Yeah.
Thank you.
JUSTIN:
I like the chord

SUNNY:
Do you guys want to know
how romantic Daniel is?
He sent me flowers
all across the country
just to win me over.
And this is before we banged,
just to let you know.
This is how men get women.
They're very romantic.
That's right,
be good to your girls.
You know,
when Zack first came to me
and told me what happened
and everything
that you went through,
I thought that, you know,
maybe we could do this,
but Daniel and I
talked it over,
and I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
You're really sweet, but...
It's just
not right, dude.
ZACK: Are you kidding?
Why? Is it...
When you have
sex with somebody
for the first time,
it should be with
somebody special
and someone that
you care about,
maybe in love with.
MATT: I love you.
DANIEL: Oh, boy.
You don't love me.
You don't know me.
MATT: I do. I've read
all of your interviews,
I've seen all of your movies.
You're smart and funny.
Making love to you tonight
would be a memory
I could cherish.
DANIEL: Kid, you're
embarrassing yourself.
ZACK:
Sunny, Matt has been
through so much shit.
I mean, terrible,
terrible shit.
You have to help him
fuck away the tears.
Zack, that's...
Not appropriate.
"Fuck away the tears"?
No matter how
much you have sex,
you can never
fuck away the tears.
Trust me, I know.
You're a really sweet kid,
but you shouldn't lose
your virginity like this.
If I...
If I can't do this,
do that,
you know, with you,
could I just spend,
like, five minutes
with you alone?
Just...
Only just five minutes.
We're not gonna
have sex.
Right.
We're just gonna talk.
Yes, I got that.
Okay.
Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
DANIEL:
You all right in there, baby?
It's been five minutes.
SUNNY: Okay.
Everything's fine.
ZACK: What did they say?
They're good.
Can you move over, man?
Oh. Yeah. Sure.
I saw this shit on ESPN2,
where, like,
these little
Asian kids stack cups.
It's like...
They do, like, like,
crazy-ass shit.
MATT: Thanks again.
SUNNY: All right.
ZACK: Hey, what happened?
What happened?
Sorry, excuse me.
JACOB: What the fuck?
MATT:
Thank you very much, sir.
DANIEL:
Yeah, no problem.
MATT: I really appreciate it.
MATT: All right, guys,
let's get out of here.
Come on, let's go.
Okay. Fine. Whatever.
All right, guys.
Good luck to you.
MATT: Thanks again, everybody.
ZACK: Matt? Dude?
What happened? Matt.
After I talk with Nicole,
I promise,
everything will be...
ZACK:
What? What does Nicole
have to do about that?
ZACK: Uh, Matt?
MATT: Yeah.
Did you have sex
with Sunny Leone?
MATT: All right.
I sucked her tits.
ZACK: $2,500, and all you
did was suck her tits?
MATT: Can we just
please stay focused
on finding Nicole?
ZACK: Be aggressive.
JACOB:
What did he say, dude?
He said he was
going to take my glasses
and shove them up my rectum.
JACOB:
Yeah, I don't feel like
getting molested today.
Let's get
the fuck out of here.
ZACK: Where you going?
What are you doing?
Hey, man...
Hey, what are you doing?
Go, go, go, go, go.
JACOB: Yeah, yeah.
That's what I thought.
All right.
Put that there.
ZACK: Fuck!
(SNEEZES)
(GRUNTS)
(WHISPERING)
Where is she?
ZACK:
Her keys aren't even here.
What the fuck, dude?
Did you even call her or...
Well, I wanted to
talk to her in person.
I said...
Yeah, but you...
I... I couldn't...
You never assume
someone's at their house.
JUSTIN:
Maybe she's in your room.
Holy shit! Fuck! Fuck!
JUSTIN: Oh, God. Oh, God.
I don't...
NICOLE'S DAD:
Open this door now!
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)
NICOLE'S DAD:
I'm gonna call the police!
ZACK:
Hang on! I got it.
I got it.
That was my finger!
Open the door!
We gotta get
the fuck out of here.
Fuck you, Justin.
JUSTIN: Out the window?
MATT: Will you be okay?
ZACK: Yeah, whatever.
Okay. Okay.
JACOB: Guys, run!
Look out!
There's a puppy.
Dude! Run, now!
We gotta go?
Yeah!
ZACK: Holy shit.
Hey, all of you, shut up.
Hey, cheese. What?
Where is it? Okay, bye.
She's going to a party.
MATT: Wait.
What kind of a party?
(ALTERNATIVE ROCK

(CHEERING)
(INDISTINCT)
Anybody seen
a girl named Nicole?
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Harry! Harry!
Hey, it's Zack.
You remember, uh,
my brother Matt?
You sucked my brother's
girlfriend's tits?
They're not letting
us into the party.
You must be Matt.
Is that right?
MATT: Yeah.
Yeah? What's up, buddy?
Nice to meet you.
Matt.
Yeah.
Hey, it's Jacob.
These four are good.
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no, no?
We have orders to
not let any guys in.
All you guys,
we're going in this way.
We're going down there.
Let's go.
Follow my voice.
Hello.
Awesome.

MATT: Hey, Nicole?
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
JACOB: What kind of
fucking frat house
do you run here?
Is that her right there?
MATT: Where?
Right there,
in the green.
The green talking
to the guy in the white?
MATT: It's not her.
HARRY: Nicole!
NICOLE: Matt!
MATT: Nicole.
What are you doing here?
I just went on a date with
Sunny Leone last night.
Congratulations?
Did you fuck her?
No, I didn't.
Okay.
Uh...
All I did with her
was suck her tits.
I don't care, Matt.
Don't you see?
I don't care about
you and Harry anymore,
'cause I had my own,
you know, uh, event.
Now we both fucked up,
but we all
fuck up sometimes.
That's really funny
because that's what
I said to you
way in the beginning.
Well, I hadn't fucked up then.
Now we both fucked up.
Tit for tit...
Tit for tat.
You didn't expect me
to come back, but I did.
I don't know.
I just thought it was
a really brilliant plan.
And it was.
I mean, you know...
We were
the wonder couple.
We were going
to be like...
Fantastic Four minus two.
Fantastic Two.
I just want to
get back together with you.
Matt, I know I said
I wouldn't film,
but you're gonna
thank me later,
'cause your dick looks huge.
Oh!
JUSTIN: Hi.
JACOB: You all right?
JUSTIN:
Where are we parked?
Matthew!
JACOB: Put it to your lips.
On your lips. Just inhale.
Take a deep breath and rip it.
Oh! Whoo!
JACOB:
Hold it. Hold it.
Release.
(COUGHING)
JUSTIN:
Welcome to the club, man.
Virginity...
I thank you, sirs.
JACOB: Completed.
Virginity lost.
I...
JACOB:
Virginity depleted.
I feel...
JACOB: Virginity...
Virginity done, son.
JUSTIN: Give us the details.
JACOB: Yeah.
So, what was it like?
These are the rules,
you know.
What are the details?
Oh. Come on.
Hey, respect his privacy.
He just got laid.
Give him some minutes.
Thank you.
ZACK:
You just need to promise me
you'll tell me one thing.
Just one thing,
that's all I want to know.
I'll try. I will.
Does she squirt?
Did she have a geyser?
'Cause she totally
looks like...
Her vagina was
like Old Yeller.
JACOB: No, not Old Yeller.
Old Yeller's a dog.
Yellow, you're thinking of...
Yellowstone Park.
Yeah.
Old Geyser.
JACOB: (LAUGHS)
No, not...
Old Yeller.
Old Yeller was the dog.
JUSTIN:
Old Yeller is the dog.
What's the name
of the geyser?
Old Geyser.
No.
JUSTIN: Old face...
Face/Off!
ZACK: Jacob, close it out!
Good man.
Here's,
here's a better question.
Did Matt pull out?
No.
JACOB: Hell no.
ZACK: Nicole.
Nicole's not here. Nicole!
JACOB: You didn't
really bring Nicole.
Guest of the hour.
That is so sweet.
MATT: Can Nicole take
her first hit, too?
ZACK: Nicole, will you
take your first hit?
Should I do this?
Yeah, come on.
Make love to you.
ZACK: First time fuckers.
Big rip. Big rip.
Big rip. Pull out.
(BUBBLING)
JUSTIN: Get in there.
All right.
You got it? Lock lips.
Like, air tight.
It's all about
the air tightness.
Right here.
Yeah!
We did it!
If I had to
impart any of my wisdom
from this experience,
I just want to say,
"Do it with somebody
that you love."
But when you do it,
do it hard and do it long.
And fast.
Ow!
(OH MY GOD PLAYING)
JACOB: Come on, get him!
My favorite thing
that I ever saw
on the Internet,
on the YouTube, was a horse
getting hit by a train.
ZACK: (LAUGHING) What?
JACOB:
Wow! You saw that?
Yeah. It was almost as good
as chimp-frogging,
where the monkey
was being given head
by the frog.
