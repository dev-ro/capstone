This is the worst storm yet.
Yeah, almost
every night
for the last three months.
Well, it sure ain't natural.
I'm getting away from this
lightning while I still can.
Ah, you'll be soaked to the bone
before you get ten yards.
Well I'd better
be soaked than barbecued.
What if we ran for it?
It's impossible
to make it to the main road.
Maybe we can make it
to the old willows place?
Are you out of your mind?
Do you actually
believe in them monsters?
But the newspaper
story said...
Oh, act your age, Mac.
Here's the house.
Don't look good to me.
Ah, you're just spooked.
Well, spooked or not, that
place just don't look healthy.
It hasn't been lived in
in 15 years, it's deserted.
It is, huh?
Thought you said
this place was deserted?
Well, it's supposed
to be. I don't get it.

what do you want?
Let's get out of here.
Uh, we didn't
think anybody lived here.
It was all his idea.
We thought maybe
we could get out of the rain.
It looks like
it's going to last all night.
It's pretty bad out there.
Oh no, you can't stay.
Oh, be reasonable.
You can't stay.
We might catch pneumonia.
You're not welcome in my house.
Go away, now, go, go, go.
Lobo!
Lobo! No, no!
The monster!
Now you believe
those newspaper stories?
Do you hear that, lobo?
You're the monster.
Perhaps, one day
you will meet the monster.
Heh, heh, heh.
Wait, wait!
I can't run anymore.
We gotta keep going.
That was the monster.
Well, I wouldn't give to see a
couple of cops right about now.
Come on.



you, get these straps off of me.
Let me loose, do you hear me?
Lobo hears,
but he cannot speak.
Lobo is mute.
Because of
the storm, I was afraid
we were not going
to have guests tonight.
Lobo, you're too
rough with my patient.
Already, he tires
of our humble hospitality.
I said, let me out of here.
At the moment,
i am afraid it is impossible.
Who are you?
Vornoff, Dr. Eric vornoff.
The name will
mean little to you.
what are you doing to me?
You will be soon
as big as a giant.
Strength of 20 men.
Or, like all the others,
dead.
Turn off the switch.
Isn't it strange, lobo?
Our friend always returns home
after his long, tiresome swim.
What's your name?
You find out.
We will.
Hey, watch that cigarette.
What were
you doing in the swamp?
What's it to you?
That's enough of that, buster.
No tank town jail
can hold me.
I'll be out of this
here rat trap in 24 hours.
That's what you think.
Vagrancy will
hold you for 72 hours.
Take him downstairs
and book him.
All right, let's go.
Let go of me, I said.
You can't do that to me.
Let go.
Hey, where do you think
you're going?
What do you mean,
where do I think I'm going?
I've got captain
Robbins' newspapers.
You have, have you?
And since when you don't leave
the captain's papers with me?
Since the captain told
me to bring 'em in myself.
When you read 'em first,
you mess 'em up.
Hold your tongue
and give me those papers
or I'll have you locked up
for peddling without a license.
I got a license.
Want to bet I can
make it expire all of a sudden?
Come in.
Here's the late
editions, captain.
Look, why can't
i work on this case?
Get back to your desk.
Yes, sir.
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?
I told the boy to bring
the papers in himself.
Yes, sir.
But if you ask me...
I didn't.
Yes, sir.
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?
Where's lieutenant Craig?
In his office, I think.
Send him in.
Yes, sir, right away, sir.

come in.
Hi, captain.
Hello, dick, sit down.
Seen today's papers?
Is there anyone who hasn't?
Well, there's the one
nice thing about birds.
They never cause
anybody any trouble.
Your girlfriend
writes a good story.
She thinks so.
Anything new.
No.
12 disappearances around this place
and nothing to go on.
And nothing this time either.
Been around that swamp so many
times, I'm getting web-footed.
It's been fired recently.
It's been fired
several times recently.
jake long's wife identified
it a little while ago.
The coat belonged to
Ralph mcrae, his partner.
They went hunting by
marsh lake and never returned.
Not much left of it.
Boys found
it floating in the lake.
What about the rifle?
About a mile from
the old willows place.
All ties together.
But it doesn't prove anything.
You think there's anything
in these monster stories?
Your girlfriend does.
What about you?
The police
don't believe in monsters.
Facts are our business.
Facts and only facts,
and don't you forget it.
I'm telling you,
the captain isn't seeing nobody.
Now please be a good girl,
miss lawton, and go.
Captain Robbins, will you tell
this junior g-man to let me go?
Kelton.
Yes, sir.
Let her go.
Just as you say, captain.
It used to
be a newspaper reporter
could get information
around this place.
What in the world do you mean?
Now, he makes like a comic.
Dick Craig, I don't put
much stock
in the future success
of our married life
if already you're
holding out secrets on me.
You've been dodging me
all day.
Where'd you
get an idea like that?
You mean you
haven't been dodging me?
No.
And all those times I called.
And kelton said the line
was busy, it really was?
Yes.
Ok, let's have the story
on lake marsh and the monster.
Uh... monster, monster... aaah.
I thought so.
There is no
such thing as monsters,
this is the 20th century.
Don't count on it.
Monsters, I mean.
Now, Janet.
Don't you "now, Janet" me.
And you can count
our engagement off.
- You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
No, she doesn't.
I most certainly do.
Well, then, give him back
the ring.
What?
If you're throwing over the
marriage, give him back the ring.
Now, chief, I...
Captain.
Give him back the rock.
It's the only fair thing.
I'd rather throw it
in lake marsh first.
Besides, we've got
to leave our personal lives
out of our business lives.
As it should be.
As I've been saying
all along.
Dog! Now, what about
the monster story?
Well, that's your own story.
You wrote it
and you're stuck with it.
There's no
such thing as monsters.
But two more men
have vanished up at lake marsh.
That makes
12 in three months.
Everything points
to an inhuman violence.
Or do you still stick to
the alligator devouring routine?
Oh!
You're withholding
news from the public.
Janet, you may not
believe this,
but you got
all the story there is.
You're right,
i don't believe it.
Well, nevertheless,
it's the truth.
Except for the monster, figment
of your very vivid imagination.
While we've got
nothing more to go on
than what you reported
to the paper.
The figment of my imagination
is something I believe
and you haven't
been able to disprove it.
We've conducted
every possible search.
Monsters, it's fantastic.
You know that.
Our business
is dealing in facts, evidence.
Can't you see that?
Men disappearing. Huh.
There's plenty
of quicksand out there.
Yeah,
12 went down in the same place.
Well, we're doing
our best to solve it.
Maybe your
best isn't good enough.
- Janet!
No, I mean it.
No clues.
What's this, a dancing costume?
And this, a pogo stick?
Well, I've got to admit
those we're found at the lake.
But remember,
they were in your own story.
No human did this.
So you say.
Well, looks like I've run
into a dead end around here.
Ok, if you boys wanna
play a game of secrets.,
there's nothing
left for me to do
but take a run out
to lake marsh myself.
Over my dead body.
That could be arranged.
Goodbye.
She's just crazy
enough to do what she says.
- You know what, captain?
What?
I think you're right.
Hi, tillie.
Hi, Janet.
Long time no see.
Tillie, do you remember
a couple of years ago
in the real estate section
when the old willows
place out on lake marsh
was up for sale,
against back taxes?
Seems to me that was around
November or December of '48.
- Wanna see the files?
Yes.
Just a minute.
Here they are.
October to December, '48.
In the top file there.
I won't be long.
Take your time I ain't going
anyplace, and neither are they.
Find what you wanted, Janet?
Yes, thanks. Sorry to leave
such a mess for you.
Well, that's
what I get paid for.
Be a dear, tillie.
Call the boss.
Tell him I'll be gone
the rest of the day,
- I'll report in later.
Sure thing.
On something hot?
Oh, it could be.
Oh, and dick.
Call him at headquarters,
break my dinner date with him.
Tell him I... I have
an ulcer or something.
Leave it to me. I fix.
Ok.
- Hi, Janet.
Oh, hi, Marge.
Janet. Still
on the monster hunt?
What do you think?
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.
Something about the police
wanting those monster stories 86'd.
You've got
the whole town in a panic.
I didn't hear you.
- I said...
I know what you said.
But I didn't hear you.
I get it. See you later.
Lieutenant Craig has
been working on the case
a long time, professor.
I'd like him to hear
what you just told me.
I should be happy
to cooperate.
Oh, hello, dick.
Professor Vladimir strowski,
lieutenant Craig.
Glad to meet you, professor.
How do you do?
Professor, will you
bring him up to date?
Lieutenant Craig, have you
ever heard of loch ness?
I think so. That's
a lake in Scotland, isn't it?
Mm. Then perhaps
you are familiar
with the loch ness monster.
Vaguely.
A few years ago, I was
called in by the British police
to investigate the appearance
of a monster at loch ness.
Well, they thought
that it was some creature
left over from a bygone age.
I am considered
an authority on the subject
of prehistoric monsters.
However, I must admit
that my investigation failed
to get the desired results,
in that I did not
see the monster myself.
But others did.
There are sworn statements.
Professor, is it
your theory that perhaps
the loch ness monster crossed
the ocean and came to the swamp?
I consider that possibility
extremely remote.
But the cases
do bear a certain similarity,
in that there are
so many varied descriptions
of this so-called monster.
And I thought perhaps, with
my knowledge of such things,
and with your
permission, of course,
that I might be able to shed
some light on this mystery.
That is the reason
for my presence here.
What do you think, dick?
Well, there's no denying
we need help of some sort.
And you'll keep your findings
secret for the time being?
As you will.
And you don't
mind a little company?
How do you mean, company?
Lieutenant Craig.
At times, the police
can be quite useful.
I should be most happy to have
lieutenant Craig's assistance.
How soon can you be ready to leave
for lake marsh, lieutenant Craig?
I'm ready.
Well, I suggest
we wait until morning.
There was a storm
brewing when I came in.
And it is
so close to nightfall.
According to reports,
the monster
strikes only at night.
Undoubtedly true, but
the preliminary investigation
should take
place in daylight.
The night,
the monster, all in good time.
Sounds logical.
Whatever you say.
Now, gentlemen, since I just
arrived in town this afternoon,
if you will excuse me,
i should like
to return to my hotel.
Certainly, sir.
Good day, captain.
Professor.
Until morning, lieutenant Craig.
I'll be here.
Strange sort of bird.
Where do I meet him?
Here, ten o'clock.
That will give
him plenty of daylight.
Well, see you later.
Hmm, got a date?
What do you think?
I'll say you don't.
I don't?
Girl from her office called in.
Said that Janet had a headache
or some such thing.
If she's
gone to lake marsh alone.
I'll take her across my knee,
if it's the last thing I do.
Well, it probably would be.
Watch him, dick.
Strowski?
Just a hunch.
Right.

you are all right now, my dear.
What?
Who... who are you?
I'm... I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.
You had a severe shock.
Oh.
How did I get here?
Oh.
That's not
important for the moment.
What you need now is rest.
Rest.
You will sleep.
Sleep.
For the lovely young lady,
sleep.
Well, here we are
at the fork in the road.
Like they say
in all good westerns,
which way to go?
Well, that's
the road to the willows place.
Let's take a chance on that one.
Ok. You know,
i get to hate this swamp more
every time I come out here.
You just weren't
born for swamp duty, Marty.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'd like to
transfer to a department
as far away
from here as possible.
The wind and the rain.
Gives this place a gleam
that just isn't natural.
The ground
alive with crawling things,
crawling death.
You're right there, Marty.
This swamp
is a monument to death.
Snakes, alligators, quicksand,
all bent on one thing.
Destruction.
Something strange
about all this rain.
The lightning's
been going crazy too.
Maybe it's like the papers said.
All these atom bomb explosions
distorted the atmosphere.
Maybe.
You know, if I was
this professor strowski guy,
i wouldn't come out in
this swamp without a guide.
You know, that's
the one thing I can't figure.
He comes to the office
with all these monster stories,
makes an appointment
to come out here with us,
then he goes off by himself.
Are you sure he came out here?
Where else could he go?
Well, let's get at it.
Hm.
Janet's car?
Yeah,
there's not a trace of her.
Well, maybe
after the accident
she found her way down to the
road and then back into town.
I've gotta be sure.
Look, there's a coffee joint
about ten miles back,
let's go and check.
- Let's go.
Ok.
Where did you find her car?
Not a sign of her?
Where's strowski?
I told you not
to let him out of your sight.
Right, captain.
I don't like
the looks of things.
Well, get back to strowski.
I'll get word to you later.
Yeah.
You look worried, dick.
No one.
Captain Robbins,
her apartment, her office.
No one has heard from
her since yesterday afternoon.
Captain Robbins
is checking further.
Ok, but what do we do?
Orders, find strowski.
Ah, get me the city desk.
Hello, Jim.
Yeah, about the lawton girl.
Uh, he just called me too.
Who saw her
last around your office?
Don't be afraid of lobo.
He's as gentle as a kitten.
Put the tray down here.
 That is all.
Get out.
I said, get out!
that is all.
Now come, my dear.
Some cream or sugar?
You didn't
have your breakfast yet.
Now it's past noon.
You must be hungry.
What happened to me?
Your automobile, an accident.
Lobo brought you here.
To me.
What is this place?
And who are you?
Don't you remember
i told you last night?
Did you tell me?
Yes, I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.
Oh. This is
the old willows place.
Yes.
How did you know?
I checked our real estate files.
A Dr. Eric vornoff
bought the willows place
in November of 1948.
You are a newspaper reporter,
huh?
Yes.
My name seems
to mean much to you.
Well, actually it wasn't
your name I was interested in.
Through
the mysteries of lake marsh,
and the willows place
being right on the lake.
I looked in the files
to see what happened to it.
Your name was
there as the purchaser.
I thought perhaps
you might have heard
something about the monster.
Oh, my dear miss lawton. I...
When did I tell you my name?
You didn't.
But since you were unconscious,
i took the Liberty
looking into your purse.
You must have
seen my press card.
Yes, I did.
Well, since you knew the answers
already, why the third degree?
And who or what
was that monster?
Oh, he's quite human.
I discovered him in
the wilderness of Tibet.
He has been quite
useful to me... at times.
But now, since
your tiring experience,
i think we have talked too much.
I'm not the least bit tired.
But you are tired.
You are so tired.
Strange.
Suddenly, I...
I do feel very tired.
Yes.
Very tired.
Very tired.
Lobo! Take the girl
to my quarters.
My dear professor strowski.
Well, it has been
a very long time.
Vornoff.
It is you.
You can see.
In Paris,
i missed you by a month.
In London, a week.
At loch ness,
by only one day.
The monster of lake marsh
sounded again like you.
Why the sudden interest in me,
professor strowski?
Your experiments
in atomic energy, of course.
Ah, so my dear country
now believes in my work.
And that it can be a success.
Our government wants
you to return, vornoff,
to continue your research
and experiments there,
where you can have
everything at your disposal.
Why do you laugh?
Surely this is not
a laughing matter?
My dear professor strowski.
20 years ago,
i was banned from my homeland.
Parted from my wife and son,
never to see them again.
Why?
Because I suggested
to use the atom elements
for producing super beings.
Beings of unthinkable
strength and size.
I was classed as a madman,
a charlatan,
outlawed in the world of science
which previously
honored me as a genius.
Now, here in this
forsaken jungle hell,
i have proven
that I'm all right!
Now, professor strowski,
it is no laughing matter.
Yes. Yes, indeed
it was a tragic error.
But, as soon as I had learned
how correct your findings were,
always have been,
I informed those in authority.
Vornoff, I have
searched for you everywhere,
everywhere I hear
stories of monsters.
Now, I am here,
sent to bring you home.
Home?
I have no home.
Hunted, despised,
living like an animal,
the jungle is my home.
But I will show the world
that I can be its master.
I will perfect
my own race of people.
A race of atomic supermen
which will conquer the world.
Yes. Yes, of course.
A truly great master race,
such as I convinced my superiors
only you could create.
One with which our government
can rule the world
without debate.
You misunderstand me, strowski.
I don't intend to return home.
My plans are for myself.
Are you mad, vornoff?
One is always considered mad,
when one discovers something
that others cannot grasp.
Our government ordered
me to bring you back.
I'm afraid you will
find that rather difficult.
You see, vornoff,
i did not come alone.
Neither did I,
my dear strowski.
Bring him along, lobo.
Come, come.
Hurry!
You are a fool, vornoff.
You... you may... you may kill me,
but others will come.
Silence.
You will never get
away with this.
Put him in there.
Vornoff! Vornoff! No! No!
Help! Help!
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Vornoff!
Now, professor strowski,
you will get a much closer view
of the product of my genius.
The alleged
monster of lake marsh.
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Vornoff! Vornoff!
Your country offers fame
and fortune for my return,
but my price is
so much more great.
You will disappear,
professor strowski,
just as all the others
have disappeared.

vornoff! Vornoff!
It's a rental car.
Think it's the one
strowski used?
I'd make book it is.
It's getting dark now.
You take the car,
and go down to the beach.
I'll go through the swamp
to the old willows place.
Ok.
Oh, here.
You'd better take this with you.
Right.
- Oh, Marty?
- Yeah?
You see anything suspicious,
you know where I am.
Trouble is, everything
in this swamp is suspicious.
What can I do for you, sir?
Captain Robbins, homicide.
Why, captain I haven't murdered
anyone in a month of Sundays.
Did Janet lawton stop by here
late yesterday afternoon?
Oh, just a like a policeman,
no sense of humor.
Yes, she stopped by
late in the afternoon.
Remember the time?
Well, not to the second.
She came in around two,
and left around 3:30.
Then again,
that isn't so late, is it?
What'd she want?
She was looking
for information.
That I'm sure of.
Do you happen to know
what that information was?
Well, sure.
- Well?
Well, what?
Must we play games?
I didn't know we were.
What was miss lawton
looking for in the files?
Oh, well, why didn't you
ask that in the first place
instead of all
your chit-chat?
She was looking over
the real estate files
in October, November
and December of 1948.
In particular, the sale
of the old willows place,
out on lake marsh.
Did she find what
she was looking for?
Well I guess she did. At least,
she found the sales notice.
I saw it myself
after she rushed out.
She left the paper open
at the November 26th date.
Wanna see it?
Why, very much.
Well, it's right up there.
I haven't had time to put it back yet.
Yeah, Dr. Eric vornoff.
Give me all you have on him.
I'll hang on.
Are we ready for the girl?
Here.
Oh, lovely.
Strap her to the table.
Do as I command you.
I'll teach you to disobey.
You will obey.
Strap her in.
Strap her in, I command you.
Get the equipment ready.
It will hurt just for a moment,
and then you will emerge a woman
of super strength and beauty.
The bride of the atom.
You are insane.
My paper knows where I am.
You can't hurt me
and get away with it.
As soon as my experiments
are completed,
no one can ever touch me,
I will make the law.
Either way,
whether I succeed or fail,
it will not
hurt you very long.
Let me go! Let me go!
You heard what she said.
Who are you?
For one thing, the police.
Now turn her loose
and make it fast.
You have the advantage
for the moment.
Stop talking
and turn her loose.
Dick.
Take him out, quickly.
Where's lieutenant Craig?
We found strowski's
car down the road.
Lieutenant took off
through the swamp.
Sent me down here to
the beach to wait for him.
Where was he heading?
Old willows place.
- Kelton.
Yes, sir.
Now, this is
your first time out.
- Don't mess up the operation.
Yes, sir.
I mean no, sir.
martin,
you stay with me.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
I'm sure my experiments
on the young lady
will interest you.
I'll live to see you hang.
There are much more
important things to attend.
I hope the straps
are not cutting.
Such lovely skin
should not be marred.
Lobo, stop.
Stop. Stop, I command!
Stop!

easy, Janet.
Janet, get me the gun.
Easy.
I've gotta stop him.
You can't, he'll kill you.
He probably will anyway.
Stay here.
Turn that thing off.
Lobo!
No! No!
Stop.
I beg you!
stop!
Kelton,
you station yourself here.
You men surround the house.
martin, you come with me.
All right, captain.
- Ready?
Right.
look, the place is on fire.
Let's get out of here
before we get roasted.
Ca... captain, look!
What do you suppose
that was?
Well, whatever
it is, get it.
Oh, wait a minute.
Here comes dick.
He's got Janet.
Get him!
No, don't shoot!
You might hit Janet.
Let's go.
- Marty.
Yeah?
Give me a gun.
Here you go.
There he goes!
Can I suggest
something, captain?
No!
Now get on up over that ledge.
Get up over on top of him.
That's what I was gonna suggest.
Well, stop the chattering.
- Get in action.
Yes, sir.
Now he's clear.
Give it to him.
I think it's broken.
Don't move, buddy.
he tampered in god's domain.
