Hey!
The sheriff ain't in.
Come back tomorrow.
You say something?
I only said the sheriff ain't in.
Well, where would we be
lucky enough to find him?
Fishing.
He'll be back tomorrow
for the hanging.
If I can help...
Why not.
You could tell us something.
Sure. What?
Some time ago, there was
a reward out for Bill San Antonio.
Five thousand, I believe.
I can check up.
It will only take a little while.
- I'll be...
- Take my word for it.
Here's all that's left of him.
Enough for the reward.
Our old friend died with his boots off.
No, I'm sorry. We need sure proof.
Unfortunately, I can't supply you
with "sure proof", as you call it.
He got blown up.
Come on, Hutch.
Let's not waste any more time.
Hey! What shall I do with these?
Play with them in your free time. Ha!
What can I do for you?
Take three or four men
and have them carry in the case
that's on that wagon.
And tell your friend to keep
his eyes peeled.
There's 300,000 in there.
Dollars?
As good as.
It's gold.
Same as got robbed from a train
on the MK&T a month ago,
and which we were lucky
enough to pick up.
- Really, sir, I...
- Just one more thing.
Where can we find the owner
of this piggy bank?
Mr. Harold's office is upstairs,
but the president isn't scheduled
to see anyone today,
Mr... I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name,
and unless I know that, I...
I never told you. Come on, Hutch.
Hey, you two.
If Mr. Pick says the president
won't see you,
it means you ain't going
anywhere, understand?
Get a move on.
Let's get that case out there
unloaded now, buttercup.
There's no use in running risks.
My good man, I think you better
announce us... to your boss.
But weren't you told that Mr. Harold
receives callers only by appointment?
He'll receive us. You'll see.
Just say it's San Antonio
who wants to talk to him.
You could be our Lord in person,
it would be the same thing.
Don't forget, huh?
Tell him, "Bill San Antonio".
If he sees us, it means
he and Bill were in cahoots.
Because a bandit that steals
a bank's gold from the train
is likely to be the last person
in the world
to know the president of that bank.
So if Bill was telling the truth,
and he kept swearing he was,
then half the gold he robbed
in the past few years
finished in the pockets
of that gentleman, right?
That's why he won't see us.
All we have to do is look at him
to understand it's impossible
a man like him
could have got mixed up
with that son of a bitch.
Oh, may he rest in peace.
Let's get out of here, Cat.
We might as well wait.
If I'm right...
...I'll make him spit up
all the loose change.
There's enough of that
for both of us to retire on.
Come in, gentlemen, please.
You think we overdid it?
No.
A small personal gift from Mr. Harold.
How should I put it?
A little memento of his appreciation
for what we've done for him.
In gold, mister.
Get it ready. We'll be by
in a couple of hours.
You're gonna need a little time.
Gold, huh?
- How does it feel to be rich?
- I don't know.
I'm not used to it yet. Hey, watch it.
A quarter of a dollar
and few minutes' patience,
and you'll have a picture of yourself
just as you are now
that will last centuries.
Take advantage now.
Tomorrow could be too late.
Hold still, please.
- Hold still, please!
- You know,
- I never had my picture taken.
- One, two,
- Now's a good a time as any.
- three, four, five,
- No.
- six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twe...
No, no, no, no, no. Now,
a little more to the left. No.
Now. Now. This way. Here you are.
Now, good, now. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
No, no, no. Now, don't move.
Now, that's right.
This way, you won't get tired.
Yeah, lean on it. That's it. There.
See how simple it is? Magnificent.
A stupendous sight,
but I know what's missing.
Just a minute. It costs only
a few cents more,
but wait till you see the effect.
Now, perfect.
Hold still now, please.
Just a matter of seconds.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven...
Looking at you, I don't know
which one is the pigeon.
...nine, ten, eleven.
You moved!
Oh, my dove!
The man shot my dove!
That's the only one I have!
Forget it.
Now, why don't you get smart.
Why should I?
He ain't fooling around.
Because I say so!
Hey, you!
Come on.
Come on. Hold him down.
The suits they make nowadays,
they sure aren't worth a damn.
I've had enough fun.
Let's go get our money at the bank.
Get ourselves out of this lousy village.
- That's it.
- Little more.
Look at that, would you?
Take the rope.
They sure got nasty folks
around here.
They hang people too.
I'll repeat it for the last time.
Yes or no?
I want an immediate answer.
All right. So you're not interested.
Do you or don't you want
to understand
I'm giving you an opportunity
to save your neck
from that damned rope?
When I give my word, I keep it.
I said tonight, and tonight someone
will get you out of here.
You'll have to take care of the rest.
But if I know you, you'll find
a way to recover the money
those sons of bitches stole from me.
I lost a partner recently.
If you're interested,
you can take his place.
We were friends once.
We can be again.
It's up to you, and you know it.
- All you have to do is just...
- Where can I find them?
As far as I know, they're still in town.
They're in no hurry.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, fella.
- It's gonna rain soon. We need it.
- Yeah, we need it.
Come inside.
I got something to tell you.
Well, why don't you boys just
sit down and have a drink.
I just had a bottle delivered
to me that'll really...
Get moving. Sooner we get
out of here, the better it is.
Come on, hurry!
I said, hurry up!
You, huh?
I wonder if it works.
Come on.
Let's go.
It works.
Pretty, isn't it?
It's like the life of a man,
beautiful while it lasts.
- I told you this afternoon...
- You told me too much.
In my opinion, you're getting old.
Once, you used to count your words.
But this afternoon,
you told me so much...
...I almost forgot to ask
about our mutual friends.
Our friends?
Still not thinking of that old story,
are you?
No. Simple curiosity.
You know...
...15 years of hard labor sort of cuts
into your social life.
What are they doing now?
Where are they, around here?
No. Paco went back to Mexico.
Years ago.
Years ago?
And Drake? What about Drake?
He settled in Fair City, near Memphis,
went into business.
- Big business, huh?
- Yes. He's gone up in the world.
But as far as you're concerned,
you don't need them.
- I'm here to help you any way I...
- I know, I know.
You're here to help me
make up for the lost time.
You told me. You told me.
- You like them?
- What?
Classy, huh?
And comfortable too.
If it weren't for these, I would've
made a mistake tonight.
I would not have noticed... this.
Instead, what do you know?
My eyes fell on this
just as I was putting my boots on.
You know, it's bad taking
too many precautions.
That's better.
You know...
...the idea of killing a deputy
with my knife
wouldn't have come from
the kind of people you sent,
but from a more refined mind.
I no sooner finish those 15 years
when I'm beaten up in a saloon
and robbed of my knife.
And while I'm asleep, that knife
winds up in somebody's chest.
Somebody I don't even know.
But that little detail, the law overlooks.
And before I know it,
I'm behind bars again.
Those two you sort of hinted
you wanted taken care of,
they must have given you
a rough time...
...if, after you get a rope around
my neck without dirtying your hands,
you suddenly change your filthy mind,
all in the name of old friendship,
you say.
Actually, it's because those two
sort of took the shine off your image.
And you had no one on hand
quick enough to restore it
by finishing them off.
Isn't that it, partner?
You keep on the side of the law.
But me, with a jailbreaking charge
and the departed soul of a deputy
hanging over my head...
"Easy to handle",
you must have thought.
You're out of your mind.
Out of my mind?
Prove it to me.
Prove to me you won't double-cross
me the way you did 15 years ago.
Or the way you did
just one month ago.
Do I make myself clear, partner?
This time, I want proof.
Concrete proof.
What proof?
Yeah... what?
There, that's proof enough for me.
Buy myself a nice little farm...
...few head of cattle. Not many.
I'll have enough income left
to live on for a hundred years.
Income.
Got any idea what income is?
You put the money in the bank,
and every month,
the bank pays you interest.
You go to sleep...
...and meanwhile,
the interest is growing.
You go fishing,
and the interest increases.
And your capital stays untouched.
You sleeping?
You'd keep quiet, maybe I could.
Takes a smart man
to understand you.
You put your hands
on a mountain of money...
...no strings attached...
...and for you, it's the most natural
thing in the world, and you sleep.
Just sleep.
Hi.
Hello, friends!
There's a rumor you just
cleaned out a bank.
It so happens I had savings
in that bank.
Never mind the jokes.
Oh, don't take it so badly.
You're both young and strong.
Me, I have to make up
for so much wasted time.
There are many things
I have to attend to.
So don't worry.
I just need a small amount.
Just enough for the bare necessities.
Well, no.
Money corrupts Man. It softens him.
So to keep you young and pure,
I think I'll take everything.
You'll thank me for this someday.
Listen, before you go,
there's one thing I'd do if I were you.
What is that?
Shoot me.
What a nice idea.
The world is too small for you to get
far enough away from me.
I'll find you sooner or later.
Listen, tiny, you must have worms
in your brain.
Cacapoulos doesn't go
around shooting people
just to have something to do.
Then give me a loaded gun.
Oh, no, I can't do that.
My grandfather always used to say,
"Even if you have a small advantage,
be careful not to lose it.
"In the best of circumstances,
you'd be considered a fool."
And I always find myself in trouble
if I don't follow
my grandfather's advice.
So long, friends!
Shoot me.
You shoot me.
A peasant.
You see? A peasant
on a dirty donkey.
And a minute later, you're lying
ass up on the ground,
without having the time
to say, "ouch".
We let ourselves be fooled
like amateurs.
My farm.
My interest sitting in the bank.
Shoot me, Cat!
Come on, shoot me!
What are you waiting for?
Shoot me. Shoot me...!
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
You gone loco?
Put down the gun, Cat.
And you save your breath.
We have 30 miles to do
before we see a living soul.
Stay here. They need
water and food, I'd say.
The murrain falls on us.
And before Jim and I can make out
what's going on,
all the bulls and cows are in pastures
with their legs straight up like pegs.
And we're left with just about nothing.
Well, we were worse off
than when me and my old lady
came here 30 years ago.
Worse off, indeed.
Without a penny
for a blind man's song.
That's how it was.
I was just thinking
of finishing myself off,
- when guess what happens.
- What happened?
A miracle, that's what happened.
- Guess who appears in front of me.
- Who appeared in front of you?
Our savior.
Oh, well, it didn't look like him.
He gets off his horse,
and he says to me,
"Hey, old man.
"You look worse than an undertaker
without a job."
So while he's eating, because
he looked hungrier than you did,
I tell him all my troubles.
Of course, I'm just letting off steam,
and he don't even seem
to be listening to me,
when all of sudden,
he comes out with a big laugh,
and he says,
"Is 5,000 enough?"
And I says, "What?"
And then he says,
"Write out a receipt.
"I have an idea that you're going
to get a loan from Cacapoulos."
Pa wanted him to stay,
but Mr. Cacapoulos is a man
who likes to see happy people
around him.
So he left with a strange man
who earns his living
walking on a rope a hundred feet
above the ground,
and he went into town
with his wagon for the fair.
If we don't hurry,
that crook won't have a cent left.
Nice to give to charity
when it's other people's money.
Quiet, please. This is very dangerous.
Thank you.
Quiet, please.
Step right over this way...
Step right up here.
Well, how about this?
What's the matter with you?
Why, you little bitch. Come here.
Get your hands off me! Please! Help!
Don't! Please let go!
Skip it.
He needs a dozen like you
before he even starts having fun.
Even if you're an idiot, I don't see
why you wanna die so young.
I'll join you if you don't mind.
All right. If somebody's ready to start.
I warned you.
He left last night.
Told us he was going all the way
to Tula on the other side of the border.
He said he had
an old account to settle.
Did he...?
Did he give you a loan too?
To tell you the truth,
he offered me one.
But I refused.
We've always been able to make it
on our own, at least until today.
You'd have done all right today too.
You certainly didn't need us
to handle those guys.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Mr. Cacapoulos, too, is very kind.
He seems to wanna
make everybody happy.
And that's very nice of him.
Except, it seems to me,
it's very hard to make
everybody happy.
It seems to me that
Mr. Cacapoulos is not very thrifty.
Well...
...I think it's about time we got going.
Looks like this is it.
You like to bet?
- This fiesta, we're paying for it.
- You can count on it.
- He dead, that one there?
- "No entiendo, señor".
Este hombre, ¿ está muerto?
¿ El nuestro benefactor, muerto?
No, "señor". No, not dead.
Is... He's good to us. Not dead.
No", señor".
If I could get my fingers
around his neck...
Listen, Miguel, I wanna play a joke
on those two gringos over there.
See them?
"Bienvenidos" to Tula, "señores".
Take it easy. This stuff will knock you
right out if you're not careful.
Not me.
The hell with it. It's me that's paying.
Now, then. Piece of paper, huh?
You ugly little cockroach,
I'm gonna kill you!
We can't talk in here.
Let's go outside. I can't hear you.
We got nothing to say to each other.
Just spit out my money, and fast.
And if I don't?
I wouldn't be carrying it
with me anyway.
It's no use looking for Cat.
By now, he's about ten miles
from here thinking he'll find me.
What do you mean?
Follow me.
You know, tiny, in your condition,
I could lay you out flat.
Very quickly, without any trouble.
Why don't you try.
During my travels, I was thinking.
I decided to give you back
your money.
All of it. I don't need it anymore.
Sure, you done nothing else
but spread it around.
Small change.
And anyway, I'll give you back
even that.
There's somebody here
who owes me a big debt.
To have debts owed you is one thing.
To collect them is another.
He'll pay.
All I want is you two
to leave me alone till I get it.
And then I'll give it back to you,
seeing as you care so much about it.
It seems money is nothing to you,
I guess.
You're wrong.
Once, I was convinced there was
something more important. I...
Try to imagine that you
have three friends...
...that you've shared everything
with them since you were a boy.
Even these.
Imagine, one day
you clean out a bank...
...and while you get away...
...half the town on your heels...
...one of your good friends
pulls out a gun
and shoots your horse
out from under you.
And then they shout,
"You hold them off
till we catch our breath.
"Then we'll come back and free you."
Fifteen years I waited for them.
Doing hard labor.
And the best part is,
they didn't forget.
Oh, no.
They were waiting till I got out
so they could send me straight to hell.
Lower me gently
into a nice new grave.
And put a stone on my head.
But these friends of yours...
...how many did you say there are?
Two.
There were three.
I took care of the first.
And the second?
Paco?
It's his turn tomorrow.
I don't like to look on the dark side...
...but suppose, instead of your friend
Paco, it's you who gets shot?
Would you explain to me
why I have to go through hell
just to get back what's mine?
You don't trust me?
I have another idea.
What?
If you want, you can come with me.
Sure, sure.
Why not? The two of us together.
Be easy as child's play.
Well, now, that's a wonderful idea.
¡Fuego!
Preparados, apunten, ¡fuego!
Preparados.
Apunten.
¡Fuego!
Another one. Enrique Ramirez
Sanchez Cornejo y Mendoza.
The charge?
He refused the opportunity to fight
for the liberty and independence
of our great country.
For the defense.
A pig.
The jury?
Rebel.
Rebel.
He's a rebel.
Guilty.
Another one.
Ramirez Fernandez Sanchez
Eugenio y Mendoza.
Take your hat off!
Like you said, huh?
It's gonna be child's play.
Leave it to me.
¡Cargáis!
¡Preparados!
- "Leave it to me", huh?
- Buddy, I didn't force you to come.
¡Apunten!
¡Fuego!
Those are my friends from Tula.
I underestimated them.
You see, some friends are
better than others.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
Open the gate! Open the gate!
"¡Nombre de Dios!" The gate!
Take care of that damn machine gun!
How did you manage to get
all these people together?
I just told them Cacapoulos had
a lot of money hidden somewhere.
Look how they're guarding his life.
Now drive the rebels out!
Through the gate, men!
Through the gate!
Come on, men! Follow me!
Follow me!
¡ Viva la Revolución!
Cover him!
Cover him, "nombre de Dios",
cover hi...!
Where the hell is he going?
All right, come on.
Jump!
Wait, wait!
Onward, "mis hombres", on!
Here we are, just the two of us.
All alone.
I spit on your mother.
Not for long.
Wait, wait!
Did you make him...
...give back the money?
I forgot.
Don Pedro Ramirez Maria
Santiago Gutierrez.
Charge?
He wanted to fight
for the freedom of our country.
Guilty!
- Another one.
- Jimenez Maria Ortega
y Manolo del Fraile.
From what I can see now, we have
to share with all these people, huh?
Nice idea you had.
Yeah, now that you mention it,
it would have been better
if I'd never had it.
At least I'd be free of two imbeciles.
If only this imbecile would
make up his mind to talk.
He'll talk.
Let them finish their patriotic duties,
and you'll see.
Cangaciero doesn't have
the tender heart you have...
...you ox.
No! No! No!
I wouldn't like to be in your shoes.
Look at the mess you put us in.
Idiot!
You and your fantasies.
You're out of your head.
Don't think I'll lift a finger when
they separate it from your neck!
"You'll get it all back,
even the pennies.
"There's somebody around here
that owes me a big debt."
Then...
...when he gets that swindler
in his hands...
...he kills him without even giving him
the time to sign a piece of paper!
Coffee's boiling.
I'd like a cup.
Did you hear that?
Mr. Cacapoulos wants coffee.
And how would you like it?
With sugar or without?
Without.
Well, this time, Mr. Cacapoulos
will have to make an exception.
Open your mouth.
What's the matter, too hot?
Cacapoulos.
What kind of a name is that?
A Greek name.
My grandfather was a Greek.
He was a Greek.
Like Sophocles, Aristophanes,
Plato, Homer.
And like Ulysses,
he had to keep traveling.
He never suffered from homesickness,
my grandfather.
Oh, no.
And so...
...he left the schooner
on which he had embarked
and continued his travels on foot.
Bouncing from place to place,
trading in skins,
until he came to a Cherokee tribe.
And there, he was admired
by an Indian girl.
Or he admired her,
I don't know which.
But the fact is,
among other children...
...my father, too, was born.
And he grew up and raised a family
in a small mining town.
And he had just the time to do it...
...when someone shot him dead.
And my grandfather, told of it...
...had to get his son's body...
...and he had to take me too,
still teething...
...back to his tribe.
And I cried...
...and I cried...
...and I cried.
Who cried?
He had some very strange ideas,
my grandfather.
What ideas?
"I advise you," he said,
"never tell lies.
"It means you fear those facing you.
"On the other hand,
never tell the truth either.
"In the best of cases,
they'll put you on a cross,
"like they did someone
centuries ago."
That's what'll happen to you
if you don't cut it short.
He wasn't such a fool, your grandpa.
I'd like to know what his advice
would have been tonight.
"If you have a loaf of bread,"
he would've told me,
"no matter how large...
"...don't cut it into thin slices,
"or else you'll wind up
with an empty stomach."
Yes, he was really a wise old man,
your grandpa.
Then it's agreed.
Yes.
Quick, untie him. We'll have
to borrow three horses.
Hey.
You try anything funny, and...
What?
This way, "mis hombres"!
Don't shoot!
My grandfather used to say,
"One ally's not enough.
"Two is too many."
Try not to get yourselves killed,
my friends.
I would be very sorry!
He already told me that damn story.
Giddap.
Bienvenidos.
Mr. Cacapoulos knew
you'd make out all right.
He left me the job of burying
three of them.
This one is the last.
He says he hasn't finished yet.
He still has one to kill.
He's very, very sorry.
He says, "Don't worry."
He says, "Thanks for all you done."
He says, "Hello, folks."
Watch it, pal.
One more.
Watch it.
No, he's gonna make it.
I know he is.
Hurry up, you hear? I'm hungry.
Hey, have a look.
Haven't I seen that other one
somewhere before too?
Yeah, on top of a rope.
What...? What the...?
Hey.
Hello, friends.
Sure took you a long time.
Where?
Wait a minute. Calm down.
Where?
This is no time to lose your temper.
Where?
- Now, you don't wanna get mad.
- Where is it?
- Now, wait. Now, we'll talk in minute.
- Where?!
There.
What's that? A bank, maybe?
Safer. A gambling house.
You mean...?
You mean to say...?
I mean... I mean... I mean to say...
Yes. I lost it. AII. Every penny of it.
- But you don't have to worry.
- I think I'll kill him.
- Will you listen to me, huh?
- Yeah, I'll kill him.
- It won't help.
- Even so, I'm gonna kill you.
- If you listen to me, I...
- Take it easy, Hutch.
- Take it easy.
- Sure.
If you'll listen to me,
I have something to tell you.
Oh, you mad killer!
I didn't do it.
You know, gambling is a terrible vice.
What are you doing in a kitchen?
Earning money to eat with.
In Fair City, people with money
only think about gambling.
That's all they're interested in.
My act was going great
till they started having fun
betting whether I'd fall or not.
Are you ready to listen to me now?
We're all ears.
Drink up, shorty.
It's not as bitter a pill as you think.
So I traveled for a time,
here and there,
until I find where the third friend is.
You and your damn lies.
You came here straight as an arrow.
And leave your grandfather
and his darned advice out of it.
All right. All right.
I knew where Drake was,
and I came here straight as an arrow.
- But he's a hard nut to crack.
- Here we go again, huh?
Just let him talk.
So I couldn't settle the question
right away.
I begin snooping around,
and I end up at the casino.
And that, too, belongs to my old friend.
So as not to attract attention,
I place a few bets.
I like it.
And when I really start
enjoying myself...
You went and got cleaned out.
From what I've heard around,
those people play rough.
Mr. Cacapoulos got cleaned out
before he realized it.
He sure had a lot of money
to start with.
There's something very strange
going on in that shack.
Washing dishes brings ideas.
And sure enough, I get one.
And that's why I was waiting for you.
Listen to that. He was even impatient.
Out with the idea.
Put 50 on the red...
- Fifty on 12.
- All right, gentlemen.
Last call. This is last call, gentlemen.
I know a lot people...
Please.
Checkroom's over there.
How much money do you have?
- Change it.
- And if I lose?
Be careful.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Please place your bets.
All bets down. No more bets, please.
Eight. The gentleman's
number is eight.
Six. Try again, sir.
All side bets down. Going for eight.
Thirty-four red. Fair pass.
My friend, I'll make you rich tonight.
I'm on a lucky streak.
But... Hey.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Please place your bets.
All bets are down.
No more bets, please.
No more bets.
Twenty-six black. Fair pass.
Get it in there again, Tommy.
- Hit him!
- Come on.
My grandfather used to say, "There's
only one way to make money."
Forget it. Forget it.
Try to get in there, Tommy.
- Step right in there.
- Knock him back, Bill.
Come on, now! Come on, boy!
- Get in there, boy.
- Come on, now.
Do you think this is the moment
to waste time around here?
- Come on!
- Let's go!
Go on, ring the gong.
Sorry, gents. Sorry.
Twenty-five dollars,
I say, 25 dollars to anyone able
to knock out
this great champion
from Mississippi,
Tommy Glancing Blow,
in a regular boxing match,
the new sport so popular
in England today.
Come on, boys. I can't believe
you haven't got the guts. Well?
My offer not enough?
OK, I'll double it.
Fifty dollars. Fifty dollars, boys.
I'm not fooling you.
I'm talking 50 big dollars.
- Let's see it.
- Certainly, sir. By all means.
The gentleman is of little faith.
And he is in his rights to check.
Our motto is "faith and trust",
my dear sir,
since faith is the soul of commerce.
Thus, we don't want to see
your 5 dollars
until the end of the match,
in the unhappy event you lose.
Step right up, sir.
Not me.
Him.
What's going on?
- Show it.
- He's gonna show it.
Silence, folks, a little silence.
And let's free the ring.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you
the heavyweight champion
from Missouri,
Hutch Bessy, in a fight to the finish
under the
Marquis of Queensbury rules.
Come on, Hutch.
We're depending on you.
Go on! Go on!
Now throw the punch, Hutch!
Don't forget the 50!
Come on, Hutch!
You know you can do it. Come on!
You know you can do it! Come on!
Watch him! Watch him!
- Watch him. Watch him.
- Hutch!
- Don't turn your head!
- Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!
Keep your head low.
Come on!
Yeah! That's the way to do it there!
- Go on, muscles!
- Come on.
- Go on, now!
- Come on. Back in there!
Come on, Hutch! You won't miss!
Hit him! Hit him!
Stop! You gotta stop!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
- Hit him again.
- Hit him again.
- Hit him!
- Get him!
Attaboy, Hutch! OK.
He's scared of you. He's scared of you.
He's scared of you.
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!
Come on! Get in there!
Come on! Go!
- Hit him, Tommy!
- What do you mean, hit him?
- My man's gonna knock him flat!
- He's got him now.
Get him now! Get him now!
- Finish him! Finish him!
- Finish him off!
Get him! Come on!
Come on! Finish him!
Come on, Hutch!
Get him now! Come on!
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!
Come on, Hutch!
Come on! Left, right, left, right!
Get in there, boy. Come on.
Hutch won! Hey!
That was it! Goodbye!
- And what's this?
- A people-leveler, sir.
What?
When it goes off, it's better
to be the one directly behind it.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, this sprays bullets.
The sheriff says you can't tie a rope
on the roof of the gambling house.
If he'd given me the right permit,
we wouldn't be needing this.
Do you still feel like it?
This is no joke.
- Save your breath.
- All right.
So she was saying,
"Get out of my house.
"I never wanna see you again..."
"A wife should stay in her place
"instead of criticizing everything
her husband does."
You think she understood that?
Hell, no.
Can't blame a man
for going out nights,
playing cards and drinking a little.
And why shouldn't he give her
a hard time when he gets home?
If he didn't, she'd never
let him get to sleep.
- That's right.
- Here, give me the bottle.
What a mess women get you in.
Hey.
Save some.
What would a man do
without friends?
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Give up a horse for a woman,
and you never get back in the saddle.
I'll drink to that.
Now!
Hey, you see? There's nothing to it.
Pick it up and get rid of it.
I'll bet you couldn't do that.
- Now, remember, this is the last.
- I know. I know.
- The very last.
- You told me. I know.
When you play, one bet only
on one number. Any number.
You told me. You already
explained it. I know.
The fact that I explained it to you
doesn't mean you understood.
I underst... I understand.
I wait till the place opens
tomorrow night.
I go in like a newborn baby.
I change the money. I make a bet.
I play any number.
And for at least one day,
you'll have to keep your mouth shut.
Your gun.
What?
Come on, we're wasting time.
I feel naked without it.
Oh, and another thing.
This time, if you get even one little idea
in that worm-eaten head of yours...
...I'll kill you.
He's not like me, you know. He'll do it.
But this doesn't explain anything.
The explanation must be
in the cellar. Look.
Simple, isn't it?
Thomas, go up into the garret and
say something into that tube we saw.
A magnet.
Two people are enough
to control the game.
One above, who decides
the winning number,
and one here,
who places this
on the same number.
Evidently, the little ball contains
a small amount of iron
to make it obey.
Put your ear to that thing.
- "Ninety-nine."
- Don't yell, idiot. Don't yell!
I wasn't yelling, Hutch.
All right, Thomas, come down.
You understand now?
I'm not a fool.
Now all we have to do is wait.
"Guapo".
Guapita.
"Ay".
Te siento.
Wanna go upstairs?
Buy me a drink?
A drink?
Here we go.
OK.
Take it easy. Instead of bringing him
to his senses, you'll kill him.
But they're only love taps.
That's what you think.
- Everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
- "Dead?"
- No.
- Deep sleep.
- "Well, tie him up."
And if you have any trouble,
knock twice, but softly.
This thing's more sensitive
than it looks.
- I know.
- "Now, be careful."
Here come the pigeons.
- Good evening, sir.
- Evening.
A little music never bothered anyone,
don't you agree?
Now, you have to tell us
a few things, right?
- I've got a family.
- Exactly.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, please.
Get your chips on the numbers.
Damn it. All I wanna know is
where the hell that imbecile is.
You can't do it.
I haven't earned a dollar
in three or four weeks.
I don't have it.
A debt owed is a debt to be paid.
- It's your problem, Al.
- Wait until Saturday.
Afraid not.
I can tell by the look in your eye
you're dying for a little game.
I never play. It's a habit of mine.
Well, it's time we change
those bad habits.
Shall we sit down?
Don't worry.
Nobody will see us.
We'll play a little game of cards.
A very simple game.
Hold up your hand up like that.
One for you, one for me.
You have a ten, I have a six. You win.
Queen for you, king for me. I win.
Of course, the ace is always high.
You like it?
No.
Now you like it?
Yes, sir.
All right, come on.
We haven't got much time to lose.
Come on, smile.
Gambling's good for the spirit.
Three for you, five for me. I win, huh?
Looks good for me.
Ten for me. I win, huh?
Nine for you, three for me.
I win again.
King for you, nine for me. I win, huh?
Six.
Eight.
I still win.
Here he comes, flat-headed idiot.
Thank you.
Now, watch out.
The real game's gonna start.
Hi.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.
Here we go. The gentleman
would like to have some change.
All bets down, please. No more bets.
No more bets.
I pay 13 black.
Here you are, mister. 1,750 dollars.
Let me see.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, please.
Get your chips on the number
down there.
Leaving it all, sir?
Leave it all. Leave it all.
- Go on. All hell's gonna break loose.
- Right.
Thirteen black.
Thirteen black wins again.
Pay it.
What the hell's going on?
Let's check upstairs.
Right. Let's go.
...which we have chosen for our city,
Law and Order...
...is the expression of an ideal
by which I've lived,
well, long before I came
to settle here with you.
Nay, these words, "law" and "order",
have been, are and always will be
the very basis of my life.
Thank you.
And so I want to thank you
for the honors that you've bestowed
upon me tonight,
and especially Mr. Piggot.
Mr. Piggot, whose cascade
of flowery phrases
has warmed the cockles of my heart.
A round of applause for Mr. Piggot.
Just a second. Let's hear
what Mr. Drake still has to say.
We can't accept bets
over 10,000 dollars, sir.
Why?
The house limit is 10,000.
And how much does that come to
if I win?
360,000 dollars.
Really?
All right.
You get that thing spinning.
Still on number 13?
Yeah.
It would be a miracle.
I believe in miracles.
The fool doesn't even try
to keep up appearances.
Thirteen again.
Thirteen again.
No bets down after
the first turn of the wheel.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets, please.
Place your bets.
Faites vos jeux.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets, please.
All bets down, please.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, please.
- You better play regular.
- By all means.
Certainly.
Wait! Wait for me! Drake!
Drake, don't leave me! Drake! Wait!
Wait for me, Drake! They're coming!
Don't leave me, Drake!
They're coming!
Thirteen! Oh!
- Pay him.
- I can't pay it all, Mr. Drake.
He just broke the bank.
Pay him!
And send for the sheriff.
I know this fella very well.
I wouldn't be in such a rush
if I were you.
Oh, so it's a holdup, eh?
In a way. But not by us.
Am I right?
Or would you like to have
the sheriff look around?
- Maybe in the garret.
- What's he talking about?
What's all this about?
If I may give a little advice
in this situation,
I'd resolve it in only one way.
All right.
Slow down, gents. Drop your belts.
If I were you, I'd just take it easy.
Your way of doing things is gonna
bring you bad luck, Your Highness.
Don't you touch him.
Remember, he's mine!
All right, Caco.
Now, then, Your Highness.
Will you have this man who won
fair and square paid off?
Why don't you take care
of it afterwards.
No, this time we'll do it our way.
Or you got something against that?
- All right, as long as you do it quickly.
- Easier done than said.
Don't forget the small change.
I wonder if it works.
It works. Only, I wouldn't
use it if I were you.
- What?
- You're getting your money back.
That's fine. But what about us?
If this gambling house is
really crooked,
these yellow-bellies have been
tricking us for years.
Let's take a look into this dirty setup,
and if what the man said is true,
we'll make sure he gets
what's coming to him.
No!
You should have thought
of this before.
Get down, all of you. Down!
They leave, and we're finished.
These animals will tear us apart.
What are you muttering about?
I was saying it would be better
if you did leave.
After all,
it would be impossible for me to fight
against a Negro on equal terms.
Have I made myself clear?
Now, Maurice, I beg of you to make
an exception in this case.
After all, the color of a man's skin
is sometimes nothing compared to,
well, a specimen like this,
a lice-infected jailbird...
...who walks in where he
obviously doesn't belong...
...and takes over
as if he owns the place.
Am I right, Cacapopoulus?
Or whatever the hell it is
you call yourself now.
Am I right?
Is that a man?
A real man?
But... But you were once my friend.
You hear that, Maurice?
You tell me if it's possible.
As far as I know, the only feeling
that you could possibly arouse
is one of...
...pity.
Ah, you still scratch yourself, do you?
See?
You've talked too much even for me.
Come on, gents. Here's your artillery.
Give them to them too.
The checkroom's an arsenal.
Let's go. Get a move on.
Well...
...we'll have to have some
sort of a signal, won't we?
We'll use this.
When it stops, huh?
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Fifteen years I've dreamed
of this moment.
Fifteen years.
Every night.
Every night.
And so?
There's always music.
The music of violins.
A slow, sweet waltz.
I want music.
He wants music.
Play it!
Need anything else?
Clown.
A rope around that fine,
perfumed neck.
Think about it.
Not a bad idea, huh?
A beautiful rope you can see through
the bars of the cell they'll put you in.
A good, strong rope, waiting for you.
Calling to you.
Hey.
You won't change your mind, huh?
No, I told you. You can count on it.
My grandfather used to say...
I bet that imbecile got himself killed.
Ten will get you 100 he didn't.
OK?
I think you lost, Hutch.
Don't move!
The last wish of an old friend
must be respected.
Don't you agree?
