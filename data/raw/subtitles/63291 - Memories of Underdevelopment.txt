Havana, 1961.
Many people are leaving the country.
she'll have to go to work there...
Well, that is, until she finds some
dumb guy who'll marry her.
To tell the truth, she's until
something to look at...
she'll remember me as long as she's
having a rough time, after that...
I'm the one who's really stupid.
Working so that she could live like
someone who had been born in New York or Paris,
and not in this underdeveloped island...
Excuse me.
GIRoN
All those who loved and nagged me up
to the last moment have already gone...
I've been saying for years that if
I had the time
I would sit down and write a book
of stories or a diary;
now I'll find out if I have anything to say...
everything is the same.
Here everything is the same.
All of a sudden it looks like a set,
a city of cardboard.
The Bronze Titan...
Cuba, free and independent... Who would
have thought that this could happen?
Without the imperial eagle.
Where is the dove Picasso was going to send?
It's very comfortable being a
communist millionaire in Paris.
"This humanity has said enough
and has begun to move".
Like my parents, like Laura, and they
won't stop until they get to Miami.
However, today everything looks so different.
Have I changed or has the city changed?
It is the time of departure...
oh! Abandoned like the wharves at dawn.
Everything in you was like a shipwreck.
I mean, what are you reading?
something banal, frivolous and superficial.
"The Best of Everything".
- oh, yes. That film...
- Yes.
- Leave me alone, please.
- Me?
Yes, you're looking at me as if I were some
strange inset. I can't read like this.
Why don't we talk a little?
What's bitten you?
You can only talk about when
we're surrounded by insects all day?
What am I going to talk about?
one's just surrounded by bugs all day,
by rabble, by dirty people...
- This country is falling behind, as you say.
- What do you think?
Why do you say that? You've never been
interested in what I think about anything...
- What's come over you?
- You're practicing your English a lot lately.
- I think you intend to leave.
- Leave me alone!
I like you more when you getvulgar...
That always excites me,
when I see you struggle between
elegance and vulgarity.
I've been looking atyou for some time now
and you're looking really strange.
Lately you're rather disgusting.
It's that I don't have any
Yardley's hair lotion,
nor any Colgate toothpaste,
nor any after-shave lotion...
- As you know, all that helps a lot.
- Yes, it must be that...
- And yetyou get more attractive each day.
- Really?
You're more artificial.
I don't like natural beauty.
I like women like you,
who are made with good clothes,
good food, make-up, massages.
Thanks to thatyou have stopped
being a slovenly Cuban girl
to become a beautiful and dazzling woman.
I never know when you're telling the truth
or when you're kidding.
- A little of both, darling.
- Well, go kid your mother, darling.
Go to hell!
- That's very good!
- Are you crazy, stupid?
Let me go, I can't stand you,
I can't stand living here any longer,
I can't stand the heat.
You stink. Let me go.
Everything you said was taped.
- What?
- Everything. Word for word.
It'll be fun later on,
when you hear it.
- You monster! You're sick!
- Be careful, you'll break it!
Here women look into your eyes as if they
would like to be touched by your look.
That only happens here. People only look
after their own problems.
Maybe Italian women gaze a little longer,
but no, it's never like here.
since "El Encanto" burned down,
Havana is like a country town,
to thinkthey once called it
the Paris of the Caribbean.
"our wine is sour
but it's our wine".
That's what the tourists and
the whores used to call it.
Now it looks more like a Tegucigalpa
of the Caribbean.
It's not only because there are few
good things in the stores.
It's also because of the people.
What meaning has life for them?
What meaning has it for me?
But I'm not like them!
Pablo
These people say they're making
the first socialist revolution in America.
so what?
They're going backto the jungle.
They'll go hungry.
Like the Haitians.
They beat Napoleon and so?
They had the most important sugar industry
in the world before the revolution,
and look at them now.
Times change.
Besides, Sergio,
this is not our problem,
this is a problem between
Russians and Americans;
we have nothing to do with it.
Listen to me, Sergio,
this whole thing is going to blow up.
We're going to catch the first punch
either of them throws,
and you know why? Because we're
so small a teeny tiny island,
it will be you who'll catch the punch,
because I won't be here.
To thinkthat we've been friends
for more than five years.
Under Batista, things had reached the point
where you couldn't take it any longer.
Not for me, I never got involved in politics,
my conscience is clear.
The only thing I've done all my live
is to work, to work like an animal.
Can you imagine Anita?
so beautiful and yet her stomach
is stuffed with black beans.
Today I saw her having lunch at "La Terraza"
But after all they have all
the resources anyway, Sergio.
They definitely have all the means
to develop his country's economy.
Fully...
- The "know-how"?
- Yes, the "know-how".
The Americans know howto do things;
they know howto make things run.
Three.
- Checkthe oil.
- Haven't got any...
If you want I can check it anyway.
No. What for?
Shit, I feel like tearing down everything.
I've got to hand it in the same
condition as it was before.
Why?
It's been inventoried,
if I don't hand it in like it
was I can't leave...
I can't get the sealed unit,
you'll have to do thatyourself.
Things aren't what they used to be...
Yes, I knowthat.
It will not lookthe same.
If you can't get wood alcohol,
you'll have to use synthetic paint,
which isn't the same, you'll have
to paint at least this part
- so it won't look bad.
- Yes, I know.
- What about this dent?
- Well, this down here, too.
He says the only thing a Cuban
can't stand is hunger.
All the starvation we've gone
through since the spaniards came!
In Latin America four children
die every minute
due to illnesses cause malnutrition.
After ten years there will be
20 million children dead.
The same number of deaths caused
by the second World War.
It's a symbol of decadence.
But I feel better, that way
I don't have to go on fixing it.
- Well, if you like to walk.
- No, but I feel more at ease.
- Yes?
- Yes. I don't have any problems.
They say the latestAmerican cars
are incredible,
I was reading a magazine Julio had lent me.
sealed motors with two spark plugs
and a two-year warranty.
If it breaks down they give you another one.
Can you imagine?
With the mechanics we have here
that's the solution.
People seem to me more stupid.
Pablo is right, all the French stink.
They're just naturally dirty...
It's the same to me if they take it all,
I don't care!
But now it's going to be different,
man
But now I'm not going to stay at home
and do nothing like when
they were fighting Batista.
No.
The truth is I never thought
they could overthrow him
I must do something now
or I won't be able to operate
when this thing blows up.
- That's what they said.
- Who?
The Bay of Pigs prisoners.
oh! Listen to me.
THETRUTH OF THE GROUP
Is IN THE MURDERER
We found under the military
organization of the invaders
an order in the social duties
that summarize the division in the moral
and social functions of the bourgeoisie:
the priest, the free enterprise man,
the dilettantish official, the torturer,
the philosopher, the politician
and the innumerable sons of good families.
Each one of them carried out
specific duties,
and yet it was the whole, the group,
which gave meaning to each
individual activity.
Calviño was a murderer who caused horror
and scorn even among the bourgeoisie.
The housecoat I wore...
There are still bloodstains in front
because he kicked me in the stomach
and I had a haemorrhage.
That wasn't enough for him.
I had to fight so they wouldn't do that,
and they broke two of my vertebras.
Do you remember?
When they started hitting him with sticks,
you also hit him. He fell on his knees
and you kicked him in the side
and he fell on the floor.
Do you remember?
so after you murdered him you
abused him also?
He's a murderer!
- In front of you?
- I saw you!
You shot him and then laughed
at the way he died!
- Excuse me...
- At 106 Avellaneda st.
- October 6th, at seven o'clock in the evening.
- shut up, Calviño.
- Listen to me.
- And say it isn't so.
Say it isn't so.
Say it isn't true that after you
killed Morua, nine days later,
you told me how you had killed him.
- say it, Calviño.
- I can't answer her.
In all capitalist societies there is this same
type of man at the disposal of the bourgeoisie,
who is in charge of such singular duties.
In the division of moral work
the murderer permits
the existence of those who are not
directly in contact with death,
and as separate individuals, they want to
keep their souls clean.
I'm talking for myself and for those who think
like me, we might be in the minority,
I'm not talking for Ventura
nor for those miserable creatures
that have been named.
- I didn't even know Calviño at that time.
- You didn't know him?
I was just interested in living my own life.
They appear like disjointed
elements of a totality
which nobody assumes completely.
I can't answer for the others.
Because everybody answers for himself.
It seems like you want to accuse me
of being the originator of the invasion,
- No, no, I don't blame you of anything.
- I'm telling you I...
I want to insist that my mission
was purely spiritual.
I have never handled a weapon.
The fact that one is mixed up
in the conspiracy
doesn't make him a conspirator.
I've told you
that I have never been a political person.
I never had anything to do with
any political party,
and also, it's your personal behavior
that frees you form responsibility.
Everyone refers to his own individuality
when he wants to walk away from the alien
misfortune that contaminates him,
or he sinks into the group when he has
to conceal his own responsibility,
and then he, unashamedly,
contaminates the others
We are now a group.
I'm not the only one now.
It can be seen howthat responsibility,
repelled by all,
is returned and recovered by a member
of the same group...
No, you're talking of the group's cause.
It isn't mine.
In fact, the murderer-torturer
resorts to the category of totality in order
to claim his moral irresponsibility.
Listen, I've committed no direct crime,
I'm telling you.
Meeting adjourned.
But in none of the cases considered
was there a recovery
of the true dialectic relationship
between individuals and the group.
The others who came with Calviño
don't recognize themselves as part of the
system which entangles them in their own acts.
In the accounts of Freyre,
the land baron;
in the extreme unctions of Lugo,
the priest;
in the reasoning of Andrue,
the philosopher;
in the dismissals and in the bood of Rivero,
the dilettante;
in the "representative democracy"of Varona,
who could read clearly the death
which through them spread over Cuba,
death by hunger, by sickness,
by torture, by frustration?
NoEMÍ.
she comes three times a week
to clean the apartment.
she's been coming for over a year
and I've never noticed her.
If she would fix herself up and dress better
she would be very attractive.
she's as thin as a Vogue model.
I like her.
Born in Matanzas and a protestant.
A Baptist, I think.
Did they baptize you in a river?
of course...
And then...
Well.
Can't I know?
The group gathered at the edge of the river.
The pastor and I went into the water.
Afterwards he told me what baptism means.
It symbolizes the death of sin,
the resurrection of a new life
full of faith, of hope, of dignity,
then he took me to the deepest part
and put me under.
If you could have seen how scared I was!
But everything happened so quickly
I didn't even notice.
All that anxiety and all that fuss,
for nothing.
Almost everybody is an exhibitionist.
They generally give me the impression of
defenselessness, almost hairless animals,
balanced precariously on two legs.
someone once said man's intelligence
and physical imperfection are due to
the fact that he is the premature
fetus of the monkey.
There is an exquisite moment
between 30 and 35
when Cuban women suddenly pass
from maturity to poverty.
They are fruits which rot
at an amazing speed.
And the rule of the Yankees' empire
having been ended by the revolution,
the United states now uses the Guantanamo
Naval Base as an espionage center in Cuba.
ICAIC cameramen film
some of the provocations
of military personnel and
counterrevolutionaries exiled on the Base.
ELENA
You have beautiful knees!
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- Are you crazy?
No, I just don't like to eat alone.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for someone?
- Your boyfriend?
- Are you crazy?
Atyour age it's dangerous
to be alone around here.
You are crazy!
No, look, really.
Why don'tyou come with me?
I can't digest properly
when I eat alone.
I'm waiting for someone from ICAIC
who called me about a job.
From ICAIC?
They're going to test me for a film.
I have a friend who's pretty important
there. He's a director, I believe.
- At ICAIC?
- Yes.
If you want I'll introduce him to you.
- What time is it?
- Around six thirty.
He's late. He won't come now.
Are you coming...?
Bring me a dry Martini first...
Why don'tyou have something to drink?
I can't drink; I'm taking these shots
for my nerves. Look...
Why do you want to be an actress?
Because I'm tired of always being the same.
That way I can be someone else
without people thinking I'm crazy.
I want to unfold my personality.
But all those characters are
like scratched records.
The only thing an actress does is to repeat
the same movements and the same words
thousands of times.
Where did you get them?
They showed up one day.
These are the cuts the Commission made.
What commission?
The Revision Commission.
What we used to have before the revolution.
Those are the shots they took out.
They said they were offensive
to morals and good breeding.
Against morality, good customs,
all that stuff...
Yes, yes, yes,
now I remember.
- Well, I'm leaving, cause I've got a test now.
- see you.
It looks like they also had
their moral preoccupations.
At least they worry about
keeping up a front.
- I'm thinking of using them.
- In a film?
Yes.
Yes. It'll be a "collage"
that'll have a bit of everything.
- It will have a meaning.
- It's coming along, you'll see.
- Will they release it?
- Yes.
Come on.
What's your experience? Have you worked
in the theatre, T.V. or something?
No, I haven't had any luck.
Have you studied?
I was going to take some classes once,
but... I didn't.
Well, write that in on the form.
Aren'tyou going to try me out now?
I can also sing.
This sadness rejects oblivion
Like darkness rejects light.
I hope destiny lets you return
one day, to remember...
If you say so...
And you?
- No.
- sure that it's no?
What a beautiful house!
Like it?
I don't know.
You don't thinkthat we'll do anything.
Look, that's where I live.
Come on.
What's the matter?
- I don't...
- Don't what?
And your wife?
Didn't I tell you I'm divorced?
- Well, even then...
- Even then what?
What'll the neighbors think?
Well, if you don't trust me...
It isn't that.
What is it then?
Well. You go up first.
on the top floor, apartment K-L.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll make some coffee.
They're my parents, that's Laura.
They left the same day.
And you?
I, what?
Aren'tyou leaving?
I'm fine right here.
Are you a revolutionary?
What do you think?
Thatyou're neither a revolutionary
nor a counterrevolutionary.
Then, what am I?
You're nothing.
They'll send you things.
What for?
Nice shoes. What do I know!
They could even send you a car.
Laura had a figure like yours
more or less.
If you want I can show you some of her
dresses. If you like them you can keep them.
But.
Look at them anyway.
You look fine, take a look...
You'll have to button me up.
Come on, don't cry.
Please don't...
- Come on.
- You've ruined me!
Who, me?
We haven't done anything wrong...
What am I going to tell my mother?
Don't tell her anything.
If you wait a minute,
I'll go with you.
No, I want to be alone.
Call me.
Thanks to that, you've stopped being
a slovenly Cuban girl,
and have become a beautiful,
exciting woman.
I can't stand you. I never know when you're
telling the truth or when you're kidding me.
- A little of both, darling.
- Well, go kid your mother, darling.
- Go to hell!
- That's good, that's very good!
Are you crazy, stupid?
Let me go, I can't stand you.
I can't stand the heat, the sweat.
You sweat too much, you stink. Let me go!
Everything you said is taped?
- What?
- Everything. Word for word.
It'll be fun later on,
when you hear it.
You monster! You're sick!
Be careful!
You'll break it!
Give it to me! Let me go! We're through!
I never want to see you again!
I'm leaving. I'm going alone.
I don't wantyou to come with me.
so, you want to leave me?
I don't care!
- Didn'tyou use to say...?
- Nothing!
I won't be a guinea pig for
your whims and little games.
I'm going to live my own life!
I'm getting old! Do you hear! old!
iI leave alone! iI leave alone!
iI don't care anymore thatyou come with me!
What's this...?
Before your lips confirmed that
you loved me, I knew it, I knew it.
- Are you all right now?
- Who, me?
I though you didn't feel well.
I didn't, but I'm all right now.
I came to see how you were.
If you like I can help you make lunch.
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing at all...
Go on and say it; it couldn't last,
It's all over,
It couldn't be,
you don't love me any more...
Do you like the song?
Then all that crying last night?
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm not making fun of you.
You just don't have any feelings...
You don't have to criticize
the way I live, if all I have now...
one of the things that
really gets me about people
is their inability to sustain
a feeling, an idea, without falling apart.
Elena proved to be totally inconsistent.
It's pure alteration, as ortega would say.
she doesn't relate things.
That's one of the signs of underdevelopment:
the inability to relate things,
to accumulate experience and to develop.
It is difficult because here one produces a
woman shaped by sentiments and culture.
It's a soft environment. Cubans waste their
talents adapting themselves to every moment.
People aren't consistent.
And they always need someone
to think for them.
- I hope I'll see you soon, Sergio.
- I don't think so.
I already knowthe states and what's
going to happen here is a mystery to me.
Everyone knows what's going to happen here.
Well, I don't. I really don't.
It won't be like the Bay of Pigs.
Maybe. But that could have
interesting results.
That's true. But I want to be
on the other side.
You'll be safer. And you'll also
be able to see old friends.
- I know whatyou're driving at.
- Yes?
Yes. But there are also decent
people amongst them.
At least that's what they say.
I don't know if they say that or not.
My conscience is clear.
Yours, yes.
Was I like him, before?
It's possible.
Although it may destroy me, this revolution is
my revenge against the stupid Cuban bourgeoisie.
Against idiots like Pablo.
I realize that Pablo isn't Pablo,
he's my own life.
Everything I don't want to be.
It's good to see them leave.
Just as if I threwthem up.
I keep my mind clear.
It's a disagreeable clarity, empty.
I know what's happening to me
but I can't avoid it.
He, Laura, everybody...
Francisco de la Cuesta lived here.
We were eight or ten years old.
Where is Francisco now?
Does he remember our games?
I try to and I can't.
When we were at school,
the priests were always right.
They had the power then.
I hadn't done anything,
but it was all the same.
I understood then, for the first time,
the relationship between Justice and Power.
Armando's father was a freethinker.
Every week he'd give him a peso
so he could go to a whorehouse.
He took me for the first time.
To a fat woman
who charged 50 cents.
He told her to be nice to me.
But I couldn't do anything with her.
I had to find another.
After that I went every week.
All of a sudden I discovered that
Elena didn't thinkthe way I did.
I had expected more from her. I thought
she was more complex and interesting.
I always try to live like a European.
And Elena makes me feel
underdeveloped at every step.
I also tried to change Elena. And
like Laura, she doesn't understand.
she had another world in her head,
very different from mine.
she doesn't see me.
A TROPICAL ADVENTURE.
This gazelle was shot by Hemingway
during his last trip to Africa in 1953.
he made that trip with Mary,
his fourth wife.
This is one of the fastest
gazelles in Africa.
Besides being very fast,
it's constantly jumping.
He said he killed so as not to kill himself.
But in the end he couldn't resist the temptation.
We know Hemingway made
several trips to spain
as a war correspondent.
And after that, he joined
the International Brigade...
Is this where Mr. Way used to live?
I don't see anything so special.
Books and dead animals. Just like
the American house in Preston.
The same furniture and
the same American smell.
What is an American smell?
I don't know. You feel it.
Which do you like best, the smell
of the Russians or of the Americans?
Leave me alone. I don't know
anything about politics.
The tropics.
That's what backward countries are for:
to kill animals, to fish and to sunbathe.
There you have her:
the beautiful Cuban señorita.
I don't think I'd ever be afraid of
anything again, Macomber said to Wilson.
"something happened inside me when we saw
the buffalo for the first time.
Like a dam bursting.
It was pure excitement.
As if running after a buffalo
was enough to Conquer fear.
Anyway, there are no buffaloes in Cuba.
I'm an idiot.
He conquered the fear of death but
he couldn't stand the fear of life, of time,
of a world that was beginning
to get too large.
Why did you leave?
You were amusing yourself.
- Jealousy.
- oh, please!
- Does it bother you?
- No, it doesn't.
- You don't care.
- About what?
Me.
- You're the one who doesn't care.
- About what?
You don't care about anything.
This is Hemingway's private study.
He could always be found working
in front of this old typewriter.
He never sat down to write,
nor did he wear shoes.
He'd get up very early and would work
until eleven or eleven-thirty.
Very few people could come into this room
And I was amongst them.
I would walk very quietly.
The rest of the day Hemingway
would spend his time.
His name is Rene Villarreal.
Hemingway found him when he was a little boy
playing in the streets of san Francisco de Paula.
I read that somewhere.
He molded him to his needs.
The faithful servant and the great lord.
The colonialist and Gunga Din.
Hemingway must've been unbearable.
This was his refuge, his tower,
his island in the tropics.
Boots for hunting in Africa, American
furniture, spanish photographs,
magazines and books in English,
a bull-fight poster.
Cuba never really interested him.
Here he could find refuge, entertain his friends,
write in English and fish in the Gulf stream.
... Mary, Hemingway's fourth wife,
had it built in mid-1947.
Many journalists and people who wanted
to see Hemingway used to come at that time
to interview him. They never left
him in peace to write in this room.
she thought that by building that study
he would be able to isolate himself.
she had ten windows put in
so that the air could circulate
and he could enjoy.
Sergio! Sergio!
Hey, wait! Have you seen a gentleman
that was in there with me?
Sergio!
Wait a minute!
RoUND TABLE.
LITERATUREAND UNDERDEVELoPMENT
Culture, in an underdeveloped country,
is the sometimes painful and
costly operation by which people
become conscious of their ability to change
their social life, to write their own history,
and to choose the best of their traditions
to make them bear fruit
through the conditions created by
the struggle for national liberation.
We were just a few steps away from
the negro cooks and servants at the school.
I discovered I was a spy,
a derogatory term used in order
to look down on Latin-Americans.
I know nowthat though I look white, Anglo-saxon
and protestant, I really am a southern negro.
All Latin-Americans are negroes, discriminated
against, oppressed, rejected, ignored,
strangers in this new swindle which
has pretensions of universality.
The American way of life,
the great white dream of the United states.
Now it's the devil's advocate's turn,
he who piles doubt upon doubt
and who asks you: but don'tyou, guys,
realize that the words you are using
underdevelopment, underdevelopment
are sick, or at least, sickly?
Don'tyou realize that these words
might be language-traps,
accomplices of an already wasted culture,
a stratagem, a linguistic alibi,
a linguistic-ideological arrangement, that might
lead us to the mental peace of formulas?
It is useless to flee from the linguistic
continents of underdevelopment
and forget that the basic
contradiction of our times
is not the contradiction between
North American imperialism
and the three underdeveloped continents,
but the contradiction between
the impetuous development of the
productive forces of all the world
and the forms and the production
relations of capitalism,
between the socialist revolution
and the capitalist system
in its last imperialistic phase.
For example, you speak
of the basic contradiction between
the proletariat and capitalism.
I believe that whatyou have
said is entirely abstract.
The basic contradictions
are verified in reality
and when the basic contradiction is
embodied, it is transmitted into war.
For me, at this moment, the basic
contradiction is not to be found
between the European
proletariats and capitalists,
but in an area where
the war embodies, materializes,
and shows what the basic contradiction is,
in other words, Viet-Nam.
This discussion is based
only on the fact that
if the basic contradiction
is the one or the other.
on a level derived exclusively from
Marxist scholastics, I do agree with you,
but in the concrete embodiment
I see it as something else.
What are you doing up there with that cigar?
You must feel pretty important,
here you don't have much competition.
outside of Cuba you'd be a nobody.
But here, you're well situated.
Who's seen you, and who can
see you now, Edmundo Doesnes?
Your name, please?
Jack Gelber.
Why is it that if the Cuban Revolution
is a total revolution,
they have to resort to an archaicform of
discussion such as a round table?
Why doesn't it develop
a more revolutionary way
to reach a whole audience like this?
I don't understand.
The American was right.
Words devour words and
they leave you in the clouds.
A thousand miles away.
How does one get rid of underdevelopment?
It marks everything.
Everything.
What are you doing down there, Sergio?
What does all this mean?
You have nothing to do with them.
You're alone.
In underdevelopment
nothing has continuity,
everything is forgotten.
People aren't consistent.
Butyou remember many things,
you remember too much.
Where's your family,
your work, your wife?
You're nothing, you're dead.
Now begins, Sergio,
your final destruction.
Every time my old lady writes
it's the same thing.
she knows I don't chew gum and
that I use an electric shaver.
The only thing I've asked her
for are books and magazines.
I can't read her handwriting.
They're crazy.
We don't understand each other.
Hanna is the best thing that
has ever happened to me.
Running away from Hitler,
they landed in Cuba.
Hanna was more mature, more of a woman
than the underdeveloped girls here.
How long were we together?
I can't remember.
It's the best thing that
has ever happened to me.
Why did I let her go?
Why didn't I run after her?
When she left for New York with her
parents, we were going to get married.
We didn't believe in formalities
but we thought it would be best.
We had plans. I was going to go
to New York, make my life with her.
I wanted to be a writer
and she believed in me.
she believed in me.
she was going to help me.
Then my father gave me
a furniture store.
I buried myself behind a desk.
I worked like mad for two years.
"Hanna, darling, I can't leave now.
Please understand.
I don't want to go there
with empty hands..."
Hanna darling,
one day it was too late.
I'll always look for you.
Where are you now?
What do you think of me now?
Wait, stop, stop right here.

sign here...
And what's all this for?
We're justverifying.
- Yes, but...
- Don't worry,
if there's anything wrong
we'll letyou know.
Hey, wait!
You can't turn there...
- We're going two more blocks...
- Go straight ahead.
I'll get off here.
In the midst of all this
I'm living off rents.
I still have 13...
no, 12, 11 years to collect.
It's been two years since
they took away my apartment house.
Everything comes to me either
to early or too late.
Before, I might've been able
to understand what was going on here.
Now, I can't.
I'm 38 years old and I'm already an old man.
I don't feel wiser or more mature.
Rotten away but more stupid.
Like a piece of rotten fruit.
Like refuse.
It might have something
to do with the tropics.
Here everything matures and
rots easily. Nothing endures.
I'm an old man already.
I've been in whore houses since I was 13.
When I was 15, I thought I was a genius.
At 25, I owned an elegant store.
Then Laura...
My life is like a monstrous vegetable
with large leaves and no fruit.
I think I affect a certain dignity.
Are you Sergio?
- Yes, I am.
- I'm Elena's brother.
Is she sick?
she's never sick.
It's something else. she says
you abused her.
What?
- It isn't like that...
- I don't know if it's like that
You've ruined her
and that's got to be fixed.
- Well, I don't know what story
she may have told you.
No, it's not a story.
This is not something that
can be paid for with dresses.
But please...
she says you promised to marry her.
- That I promised?
- And then you abused her...
- It isn't like that.
- I don't know if it is or not!
Elena would do anything.
I should've known that.
I didn't want any trouble
with the police.
I was willing to marry her
if she wanted.
I was afraid.
Tell him whatyou told mother.
- You deceived me.
- What?
You deceived me.
Why?
You said you were going to give me
some of your wife's dresses
and then you abused me.
If you say so...
But you know it isn't true.
Besides, you're not a virgin.
You are being disrespectful!
Look.
I know my sister's no whore, damn it!
How could I get mixed up in all this?
I resigned myself.
I was going to let myself be dragged
through to the end. I was afraid.
Girls must go to the altar as virgins!
That's the greatest treasure
a woman can give in marriage.
Now women are liberated.
Don't start talking as if you were
a revolutionary because you're not!
- If you don't marry her, I'll kill you...
- Keep quiet!
What?
If I marry her it's because I want to.
You're not going to force me into it!
- Nobody can make fun of my daughter!
- Be quiet!
Why didn'tyou want to see me?
Did you want to get rid of me?
It isn't that.
I'll marry you.
I've got to think.
Think what?
I've got to get the permit, haven't I?
I've got to get my divorce papers.
- You're divorced?
- Yes, I'm divorced.
- You'll have to marry her!
- Come on, Dad, will you be quiet now!
Why did you bring him?
That night she came home late.
- You needn't have brought him.
- she told me.
she came home with her panties
stained with blood...
That's not true!
Will you stop it now?
You're going to screw it all
Why the hell did you
come in the first place?
Hey, come on, be quiet!
Hey, be quiet! Knock it off!
And you, stop it now!
I was sure she wasn't a virgin.
Poor devils!
What could they get out of all this?
- Do you have anything to explain?
- It isn't true.
I've had relations with her,
but they were voluntary
There was no abuse and certainly no rape.
All that's a lie.
sign here, Sergio.
The accused, Sergio Carmona Bendoiro,
planned to seduce Elena Josefa Dorado,
aged sixteen,
and to that effect took her
to his apartment
located on Línea, Vedado,
where he abused her virginity
though he knewthe said
young girl was mentally disturbed
and therefore incapable of resisting.
- Do you have anything to say?
- Yes.
Answer the prosecutor's questions.
Do you know Miss Elena Josefa Dorado?
Yes.
- Answer the attorney.
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.
- sorry. Yes, sir.
- Where did you meet her?
- on 23rd street, in Vedado.
Is it true thatyou took her to your apartment
and had sexual intercourse with her?
Yes.
Tell me,
before the night in question,
did the plaintiff confess to you
whether she'd had sexual
intercourse with another man?
No, never.
I was the only one who spoke with
some coherence. That finished me.
They treated me as if I had cheated some
"unfortunate common person".
Yes, also to give me some dresses
he offered me.
Those that belonged to his wife
who had left for the states.
Now, everything is "the people".
Before, I would've been the respectable
one and they the damned guilty ones.
I thought I was lost.
You wretched swine...
Degenerate...
Did you threaten Sergio's life?
Yes, if he didn't marry her.
- You threatened him?
- Yes, sir.
What did Sergio say?
He said that he would get the permit
but in the end he didn't marry her.
When was Elena taken to the doctor?
I don't know exactly.
My mother says she took her
some months before all this happened.
- Do you know what the doctor said?
- No.
And the results of the tests...?
Then came the verdict.
The accused, Sergio Carmona Bendoiro,
invited Elena Josefa Dorado, aged 17,
for a walk on the evening
of January 25th, 1962,
and during said walk, they went
to the home of the accused
located on Línea street,
where they had sexual intercourse.
According to tests performed,
there is no proof
that Elena Josefa Dorado shows
any signs of mental disorder
nor that she was insane or
unconscious at that time.
secondly: the district-attorney
has sustained his conclusions
as definite and they have been
duly recorded in folios 6 and 7.
Thirdly: the defense sustained
as definite its conclusions
in which it concretely denied
every charge pressed by
the district-attorney,
pleaded the acquittal of the accused
and the exemption from court costs.
Lastly:
in the facts proved as true
there are no grounds to sustain
the crime of rape
as charged by the district-attorney.
Due to the above and executing articles 142,
240, 741and 742 of the social Defense Code
and the Criminal Prosecution Law,
we render the following verdict:
we hereby absolve the accused
of the crime
of rape as charged
by the district-attorney.
It was a happy ending, as they say.
For once, justice triumphed.
But was it really like that?
There is something that leaves me in a bad
position. I've seen too much to be innocent.
They have too much darkness
inside their heads to be guilty.
I hope they haven't shut her up.

WORDs OF MAO TsETUNG
Trying to solve ideological problems and
the problem of what is right or wrong
through administrative regulations
or by repressive methods
is not only useless but also harmful.
... "as well as for the customers of the
tore downstairs, and also for the tenants",
Why don't they repair the balcony where I live?
I've made a report to the corresponding
Urban Reform office seven times,
that a piece fell off
and the rest is all loose
As I don't have the means or tools to solve
the problem, I'd like to know what I can do".

It's nothing.

KENNEDYsPEAKS
... a number of sites for offensive missiles
are being prepared on that oppressed island.
... an additional site, notyet completed,
will clearly be designed
for intermediate-range ballistic missiles,
capable of striking most of the major
cities in the Western Hemisphere
ranging as far north as Hudson's Bay, Canada,
and as far south as Lima, Peru.
In addition, jet bombers capable of
carrying nuclear weapons
are being uncrated and assembled in Cuba
and necessary air bases are being prepared
to halt this offensive build-up,
a strict quarantine on all military equipment
and its shipment to Cuba is being initiated.
If these aggressive military
preparations continue,
thus increasing the
threat to the Hemisphere,
further action will be justified.
I have directed the Armed Forces
to prepare for any eventuality.
What's all this for?
What are they going to get out of it?
And if it all should start right now?
It's no use pretesting.
I'll die like the rest.
This island is a trap.
We're very small, and too poor.
It's an expensive dignity.
We definitely reject any
intention of inquiry,
any intention of
inspecting our country.
Nobody inspects our country.
We know what we are doing and we
know howto defend our integrity
and we know howto defend
our independence.
They threaten us by saying
we'll be nuclear targets.
That doesn't scare us.
We have to know howto live during
the age we happen to live in,
with the dignity to know howto live,
Everybody,
every man and woman,
young and old,
are all one
in this hour of danger,
and it is the same for all of us,
revolutionaries and patriots,
and victory shall be for all.
Homeland or death!
We shall prevail!
