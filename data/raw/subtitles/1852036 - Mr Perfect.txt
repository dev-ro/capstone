Vicky, this is the last ball,
you must get him out!
Give me the ball to bowl.
You? You don't know to bowl, right?
Do you know Maths? Didn't l teach you?
You teach me to bowl.
Now?
Please give me the ball.
Your son has pushed
my daughter once again.
What happened?
She doesn't know to bowl,
but wants to bowl.
You can let her bowl, right?
lf l give her, we'll lose, father.
The winners are your friends, right?
But it isn't me, right?
Winning isn't the only thing, it's
important to enjoy the game you play.
Aren't you happy to play
with them, are you?
Can't you adjust little for them?
Why are you asking to adjust
for everything, dad?
l'm playing to win.
Come, l'll tell you a thing.
Take this entire palm as your life,
these are your friends,
classmates and relatives,
the more you adjust your life,
as many stay with you.
but if you lay rules and demands,
and try to catch them in your fist,
nobody will stay with you.
You'll be happy but only little
if you do it for yourself,
but if you do anything which others like,
your happiness will be great!
Go!
We won!
This is the problem with my dad.
He wants me to adjust with everything.
lf l adjust, l'm losing.
Though l say l'm not happy,
he's unable to understand.
That's why l've decided.
Hereafter no adjustments
l'll do if l like, l'll not do if
l don't like, let anyone may tell.
We didn't trouble them, they came,
they hit and went away, sir.
For namesake the country is theirs,
when they're cleaning toilets
and cars,
if you come from somewhere to
earn dollars sitting in AC comforts,
won't they be frustrated?
That's why they would've
beaten you up.
listen to me, say sorry and
compromise with them.- Compromise?
lf you don't compromise
and lodge a complaint,
they'd use guns to down
all of you y tonight,
by morning news would
spread about NRl's murder,
and hearing this your parents
falling down unconscious,
is this all necessary?
Listen to me and
compromise with them.
We'll but would Vicky
compromise with them?
Where is Vicky?
lts fight if it's between 2, how can it
be fight if one hits so many?
Beat the smart with intelligence,
beat the powerful cleverly,
but my friend Poorna says
to beat guys like as l like.
Greetings!
Still paining?
- No problem. l'm much better,
they haven't yet got up from
beds getting beaten by you.
You're in Australia
for 4 years now,
can't you learn to
speak in English?
My foot! He asked for our office and
you sent him to our next office.
Such words are not there in English.
That is also not there.
Hi buddy!
Our marriage is fixed.
Coming Sunday, Catholic Church.
Buddy, bachelors' party on Saturday
Call from Mindgame!
Good news buddy,
Mindgame people liked our video game.
They've agreed to 50% partnership
and launching company in lndia.
Thank God! lf we hadn't got this contract,
my father would've called me back to lndia,
and l would end up like Rao's son!
Who is Rao?
Son of Rao wanted to
become a film actor...
But his father made him a doctor...
Though minting money...
He's always like a patient,
a man who'd become superstar...
He's giving shots of injections now...
lf you don't do what you want to,
where's the kick in your life?
lf you don't believe yourself,
who will stand by you?
...if not your life will
become a hell...
You're right, l'm following you,
so l'm what l'm now,
if not l would end up
like Lakshmi's daughter,
living a life without any life...
Lakshmi's daughter...
- ls she beautiful?
First listen the matter, you fool!
Lakshmi's daughter wanted
to become a dancer...
But her mother got her married...
Though she has a billion worth property,
she's always in the kitchen...
She wanted to wear anklets
but she's holding a spoon...
lf you do what others say,
where's the kick in your life?
lf you keep on adjusting yourself,
who will stand by you?
Dad, l've very good news for you.
Project formalities are over here.
l'll start a company in lndia in near
future and settle down there only.
l too have good news for you.
We've fixed Lucky's marriage
on the night of March 3.
Marriage is in our village.
Elders tell you...
others will advice you...
lt's not wrong,
they say what they think...
What you want...what suits you...
lf you don't tell them clearly
what can they do?
lf we're not clear,
we're in for trouble...
lf you fear unnecessarily,
then your future is bleak...
What are you saying?
You say suddenly l'll drop out,
l'll quit the contract.
What are we supposed to
tell the Mindgame people?
Swathi is not accepting,
we're married just now only.
She doesn't want me to
quit job and start business,
she's creating trouble.
Didn't you tell it's our dream?
l told her, she says job is secure
but business is risk.
What am l to do now?
Do what you want to do,
don't do anything for others,
you'll never be happy in life.
l know that but Swathi
can't understand this.
Do you want us to give up
the contract and join job again?
Aren't you ashamed to say
wife is objecting?
Cool down.
- You wait.
She must be sensible,
she was fine till now, right?
Abuse me but not my wife.
- l will, what the hell will you do?
Perfume is very good,
Swathi's selection, right?
Not that...- Had it been men's,
it would've been better.
Please buddy...
Get lost!
Please try to understand me.
What shall we do now?
Let's meet them and ask for time.
Okay father...
Father says Saturday is very
auspicious for the engagement,
what shall l say?
Weekend is always happy, right?
l'm sending my daughter to this waste
fellow's home as his daughter-in-law.
Engagement is two days later.
Marriage is in Melbourne next month.
We've an animator Robert, take him.
Can you please ask Robert
to meet me?
Game is a creative job,
would he adjust in my team?
lf he can't adjust,
you adjust with him.
l'll never adjust for anyone.
l don't know what your name is,
if you don't adjust
you'll come good in life.
l too don't know your name,
if we adjust, we'll lose.
Look Vicky, get your man
or take Robert.
Only then this contract will work.
lf possible send Robert to us,
or else give us some time.
Will you lose such
a big contract for ego?
No need to come this far to lose it,
to hit another shot if you miss one.
l don't feel like that.
You wait.
- Not like that...
He's young, will he give up
the project in haste?
lf he understands that,
why would he talk so arrogantly?
Not that...
What's that cap like a gypsy?
Why are you dressed like a nomad?
Anyway what's this game?
Hitting a small ball in such a big
ground and go in search of it.
Aren't you bored with it?
Don't know who will marry him?
She'll experience hell.
After that taking my old friend
Bobby in place of Shivaji,
we started all over again
to start our own business.
We left to lndia as my sister's
marriage day approached,
l'm going to meet all of them
after 4 years,
Cadbury's are releasing
made for each other Chocolate.
So what?
For this they're asking unmarried girls and
boys in all the countries to fill this form,
when two people answer
the questions similarly,
this new chocolate will be
released by them.
Let's fill the form.
You try, l'm sure you'll get
an African girl.
lsn't the contest great?
By chance, if any girl who thinks
just like me, if such a girl exists?
lf l get such a girl?
The colour you like...white!
What you like in others?
What you do when you're happy?
Hear my humble plea,
O Gopikrishna...
You're the dazzling moonlight
to these maidens...
Don't laugh, my dear Krishna...
My heart skips a beat
when you laugh...
l've engaged the priest
and videographer.
They'll be here on time.
- Okay.
You're not seen now a day, uncle.
l'm quite busy with marriage
arrangements.
Why are you telling as
if you're managing it alone?
Aren't we helping you?
Are you helping me?
He's doing for Nandu, bride's father.
Let it be anyone, am l doing or not?
- Okay, bye.
Uncle, coffee?- Don't tempt me,
l'll come for it evening.
Okay bye.
One...two...
Oh my God! ln the third world war...
Obama too fought...
Third world war hasn't yet happened.
ls it father?
Don't overact, read properly.
- Okay father.
When l hear your voice early morning,
its gives me a great kick,
if l don't talk to you at least once,
l'm on fire from inside...- Father!
Differently...
Don't you want to know?
What's there to know?
Due to over cholesterol,
heart valves may have got blocked.
Consult a doctor, you fool!
She says she'll die for me!
How long do we've to bear
this trouble?
Till l'm married.
That's what l'm asking,
when will you marry?
Father has got you a proposal,
you know the bridegroom.
- What if l know?
Shouldn't l like her?
Not just like, you'll be as happy as
here after marriage in that home too.
How can you decide with
whom l'll be happy?
We haven't decided anything.
l'm telling you what we
had discussed, that's all.
What have you discussed, dad?
My son is earning Australian dollars,
after marriage he'll take
your daughter to Australia,
that's all isn't it?
Australia?
Not only Australia, she's not ready
to settle in any other country.
We thought about this proposal
after you said about settling in lndia.
Who is the girl, father?
That boy?
That girl?
He was very arrogant as little boy.
She used to take lessons like
a teacher as little girl.
She's a big torture, dad!
Would people be same always?
They do change, right?
l'm not forcing it on you.
l'm asking you to think about it.
That's all.
l'm there for ten days,
l'll observe her.
He's coming here, right?
l'll tell after meeting him.
l'm telling you before hand, if he tries
to dominate me as foreign returned,
and if he disrespects me,
l'll not keep quite.
Okay dear.
God, if this match is settled...
l'll make my husband to climb hills
on knees and tonsure his head.
Son, once upon a time all
these lands were ours.
Do you remember it?
Tell me if we've anything now, dad.
We've reached the place.
Temple!
Son, please stop near the temple.
We're here for 10 days, right?
We can visit later, mom.
We may face trouble for the sin
of not visiting the temple, son.
What happened, brother?
What happened?
- Flat tyre.
No stepney too.
Didn't l tell you God will
punish for visiting the temple?
Mom, God isn't sadist like us.
To deflate tyres, for not
visiting his temple.
Okay, you visit the temple,
l'll have the tyre repaired.
Find where's the nearest
shop and go.- Then?
God, we're coming. Come, let's go.
You too come fast.
God! What's this entrance test?
Send someone who can
give me a lift!
Where do you want to go?
- To Rao's house.
My car has a flat tyre,
l need to go to puncture shop.
What's your name?
Sit on pillion.
l didn't expect girls here had
developed enough to give lifts,
l was scared first.
Now l'm confident after seeing you.
Darling is the word l use habitually.
You know Dr.Rao's daughter Dr.Priya?
- l know. Why?
Nothing, my parents are
thrusting her on me,
l don't know how she'd be
and what...
Would she be good looking?
ls she beautiful?
- ls it okay if she's beautiful?
She was little mad as little girl.
ls it okay if you like her?
Shouldn't she like you?
How can she refuse a man
of my personality?
ls she so great?
Not proud, pure arrogance.
Go further and
you'll get the shop.
Can't you drop me there?
You're very beautiful.
lf l go straight, what would l get?
- Hill!
lf l cross the hill?
- River!
River?
Where can l get the puncture shop?
Why would it be that side?
Walk 10 kms this side, you'll find it.
Where have you come from?
Did you go all the way to Hyderabad
to repair the tyre?
Keep quiet.
He came back to village
after many years, right?
He would've gone around the village.
Priya, Vicky is here,
please get him some water.
Smile as you please,
this will be your last smile.
You've made me walk 10 kms.
lf l don't torture you for
next 10 days, watch out!
You're not that smart!
The moment l left you 10 kms away,
l've rejected you outright.
lf you cross swords with me,
l'll make sure you leave without
seeing your sister's marriage.
Did you've a happy journey?
lt has begun just now.
Aren't those Gucci glasses?
Good.
l've talked to all about the marriage
but haven't fixed up anyone.
No problem,
let's go and confirm it.
No need for us to go,
let's send Vicky.
Vicky? He's new to the place.
Let's send Priya with him.
- That's better!
Come, l'll show you!
Please have a sweet.
- l don't eat sweets.
We'll not serve what you ask,
you must eat what we serve here.
Not again!
Tell me one thing which can
make your sister angry.
Not one, l'll tell you 3 things.
My sister hates if anyone
calls her Ammulu.
That's more than enough.
Ammulu! Serve me chicken please.
Coming sir...coming...
l thought you'll get down
from that side.
That's why l got down this side!
Wasn't my entry sensational?
Don't you feel like living
at least a day like me?
l feel like killing you!
You will feel man! lt's natural!
But it's impossible for anyone.
Because...
My taste is different.
What are you looking at?
Remove my slippers.
Do l've to tell you that too?
This slipper too.
Wash!
Not the slippers, wash my legs.
lt seems you had a daughter.
- Yes sir.
What's the name you are
planning to give her?
My mother's name Lakshmi.
- What Lakshmi?
Don't you feel ashamed of
copying another's name?
Lakshmi...Shakimila...
that'll be great!
lsn't it sensational?
l can never reform you guys!
Uncle, if you grow moustache and
dye your hair, you'll look young.
Just forjoke, brother-in-law.
What are you eating dear?
- Uncle, S?mbhar.
lf you eat just S?mbhar,
you'll not know the taste.
Add some potatoes,
add all the dishes.
Eat...add carrot...add cabbage...
Eat...you must eat...eat...
Mash this pappad.
l'll add this also, eat.
Eat now, taste will be sensational!
lsn't it sensational?
Very good...superb, uncle.
Man must know the taste!
Uncle, please for me too!
l like you.
l'll get you something really tasty!
Did it burn your hand?
Me? No way, l can eat fire
and digest it.
You please come out for a second.
Uncle! Did you burn your hand?
- No!
Are you fine, sir?
Didn't you recognise me, sir?
When you were a kid, you said
you'll marry me if l give 25 paisa.
Remember me?
At least give him now,
he'll marry you.
No jokes please madam.
How can l forget you? You used
to wipe running nose of Ammulu.
What are you doing now?
He creates video games
which useless people play.
Have a car, right?
- Roads are bad.
l'll drive.
Why? To apply sudden brakes.
Get down!
You drive!
But l'm warning you,
don't apply brakes!
What are you doing?
- You told me not to apply brakes.
Get down!
Shall l also come?
- No need.
l'm a girl like match stick....
l won't take it easy
if you look down upon me...
l'm not less to you
in anything...
Are you happy now?
You'll know about me
as times passes...
l'm a pure bred village queen...
l grew up in fresh and clean air...
l'll never invite trouble...
l can't stop myself
from troubling you...
Hey you handsome man in suit
and boot, stop boasting...
l've the upper hand here...
Accept my greatness, it's not wrong...
You're tall like a palm tree,
in what way you're greater than me?
Stop looking at stars and
come down to earth...
My sister has a special spot
in the terrace.
She hates if anyone goes there,
if it's you she'll be furious.
Give me that!
What are you doing here?
What do you think this is?
Home or bar?
l too never drink in home, but l came
to know this place is special to you,
that's why l'm drinking here.
First get out from here,
this is my place.
My private place.
Very nice place to have a beer.
This is just the beginning.
l'll show you what is torture
from tomorrow, Ammulu.
Hey girl, how is your Vicky?
He hasn't changed a bit.
Got bored with him in 2 days.
Forget about 2 days,
l can't stand him for 2 minutes too.
A piece of moon fallen on earth...
ls boasting and one-upmanship
your birth right?
Enough of your monkey acts...
Can't you be docile like a girl?
You frog in a little village well...
What makes you so proud?
Don't tell yourself that
you're super...
Don't fly in sky
leaving the ground...
l'm a young man with moustache...
Don't challenge the mischievousness...
lf not you'll face the heat and flak...
Hey girl, stop challenging me...
Won't you lose if you challenge
the hot spicy chilly?
Ammulu, alms please!
l don't like Vicky, father.
He wants to win in everything,
very stubborn.
He hasn't changed a bit yet, father.
He's irritating me.
Tell me who started it?
Look in the mirror!
lf we smile, it'll also smile.
lf we see angrily,
it'll also look back angrily.
Humans too are just same.
You always said what we give
is what we get.
This too is just the same.
l'm not forcing you.
For my sake, just one day...
Look at Vicky positively.
lf you still feel the same,
do as you wish.
Let's forget what had
happened till now,
let's stop it here.
You're very beautiful!
That's what l said to stop it.
- l'm telling the truth.
l thought saris are irritating,
you're awesome in sari.
lf l had hurt you...
Sir!- Priya will bring
Vicky into the room,
l'll latch the door,
you cover him with sheet.- Yes sir.
lf l hit him with this,
he's finished.
Will madam co-operate with us?
Why wouldn't she?
lt's her revenge and our plan.
She'll definitely do it.
- Then, let's go sir.
How come she's coming with him
before you told her about the plan?
Not only in love, hearts exchange
feelings in revenge too.
The fight between you and Vicky
will be over after today.
Though you've beaten him so much,
he's still standing tall, sir
lt's Jalsa Kishore who has beaten him.
Mind would've got blocked
and brain would've got fused.
lt's not manly to beat
covering up someone.
l'll beat him without the cover,
remove it.
l mistook you for someone
and beat you.
Why did you throw it? Why?
Don't humans err?
How come you're so fresh sir?
- Am l fresh?
l told him not to beat in one place,
he beat there only.
Vicky, that's our school!
Do you remember?
Why not?
School makes me remember
our Maths teacher.
lf l didn't tell the tables, he would
beat with scale on the knuckles.
Pandu Babu would give his
hand to him and ogle at you.
You remember it?
We all dreamed of becoming
Sachin after growing up.
How will it be if we meet
all of them again?
Have you done it?
- We've sir.
Get it fast, cows are dying
without water.
Go fast!
- Yes sir.
Greetings uncle.
- Greetings.
Who is he? He's not greeting me.
Vicky, Anand uncle's son.
ls it you who stays in Australia?
My son is also in Australia,
he said software is going down
and may lose his job,
l said you don't need
to work there at all,
l'll fix an AC and computer in
our feed shop, come back here.
Your father isn't a
businessman like me,
what's your situation now?
He'll never face such
a situation, uncle.
He creates video games,
if one works out, he can buy
1000 feed shops like yours.
Hey, your girl friend!
Come fast, Vicky!
lt seems someone is coming
to you with a proposal.
By any chance are you
planning to marry?
You'll not do it.
lf you do, l'll kill you.
l'm Kathi Seenu, a localite!
l'm in love with her for 5 years,
if anyone upstages me...
l'll cut him with knife!
What are you doing, Vicky?
He's teasing you, right?
You beat him,
he'll seek revenge now.
What are you doing now?
You said he'll take revenge,
l'll take him to city and kill him.
Oh God! Kill me?
You'll not go to the city for a week,
what if he escapes and hurts me?
Oh no! She's inciting him!
Tell me if there's any abandoned well,
l'll kill and dump him into it.
Hello boss! No need to go to
the extreme and kill!
Hello sir...excuse me!
lt'll be horrible to die in a well.
Hello sir, l beg you,
l'll never tease her.
Oh God! l think he has
reached the well. Hello sir...
Look darling,
as much right you've to express
your love to a girl you like,
they too have the same right
to reject you if they don't like.
lf you try to dominate and
get love under threat,
it'll not last long,
because love is something that
happens between equals,
l'm sure there will be some girl
who may like you.
Come!
lt weaved me coolly...
it pinched me teasingly...
My heart turned towards you...
- You look awesome in sari.
lt's jumping with joy...
it's running helter-skelter...
My youth is confused
and in chaos...
Strange little wishes...
They're pinching me teasingly...
Little mischievous desires...
They're hurting me with pleasure...
Like you're always with me...
like my shadow...
l'm imagining you're always
watching me...
That you've become my breath...
and you're inside me...
l'm dreaming you're telling
me something...
Starting with fights and
getting closer with tiffs...
Our relationship developed
into bond...
Though we differ in thoughts...
though we're opposite shores...
The relationship is growing
stronger as days pass...
As if falling into a valley...
Like soaring above the sky...
Like meeting stars...
l fell like that,
what has happened to me?
l showed my anger on you
without any fear before anyone...
But l'm hesitating to tell you
also that l like you...
l'm getting away from myself...
when l remember your mischief...
To reach myself...your steps
are coming towards me...
lf he becomes Priya's husband,
he'll become my boss!
l must do something with him.
Will you kill Vicky sir?
Killing is easy!
But l must make him cry all the life,
why am l alive?
l'll beat him for a week
after gagging his mouth...
l'll beat myself.
When did you come uncle?
l came when you were wriggling
like a piglet on the ground!
lf he lashes me,
why are you so happy?
Bloody fat boy!
Uncle, please don't call me
as fat boy!
What else can l call you then?
You look like a bull wearing
pant and shirt,
if not fat boy,
should l call you bean pole?
Fat boy!
- No uncle!
Hereafter this area is mine!
lf you see or hear or dare
say any word here!
How is the girl?
You mean okay?
l didn't say yes but l don't have
any reason to say no too.
What did the new company
say about our project?
What's this?
He said he'll start the
company here, right?
He said he'll settle in lndia, right?
How can you say you'll go to
Australia for someone else?
The offer isn't from any
small company, dad.
He'll pay salary till project is over
and then a share in profit too.
What will he pay?
Can't we earn it here?
Can't you start the company
here taking bank loan?
Dad, it'll not work out practically.
What do you say?
Should everything happen as you wish?
We took this decision after you
said you'll settle in lndia...
Bloody dream!
As if he alone has a dream!
3 years is not big deal,
it'll be over in ajiffy, uncle.
What's more important than
fulfilling one's dream?
l mean everyone's happy when you
do something which others like.
Are you here?
l was searching for you everywhere.
l love this place.
My mother used to feed me here
when l was a little girl.
She used to tell stories.
She helped me do my homework.
All the memories of my mother
are imbibed here.
That's why l asked you
not to drink here.
My mother loved to dance.
That's why l'm still practicing dance
though she's no more.
Do you like dance?
l like dance in pub,
there's energy in it,
l don't like much of traditional dance.
l wanted to see this surprise on
your face and sent this MMS.
lf l greet you personally,
you'll say thanks,
but l wanted it to be
memorable, that's why!
l was with you, right?
When did you send it?
My laptop has that facility,
to record the message and set time,
message will be sent wherever
we may be at the set time.
First time l've spent so much
time talking to a girl.
l've lost the count of time
when l'm talking to you.
lt's your place too from today,
can drink here if you want to.
After knowing how much
you love this place...
Where's your birthday party?
Grandpa!
Grandma!
l know all of you are here only!
Please come out.
lf not l'll go away!
l'm leaving really!
Let's go, Vicky!
Oh my God!
What happened, dear?
- What happened?
Nothing happened.
Are you playing with me?
Mischievous girl!
Your home is very beautiful.
This is not our home, its Priya's.
We all are orphans.
All the old here are parents
orphaned by children,
all the children are
orphaned by parents,
after spending entire life
for children,
we are old deserted parents
because who can't earn anymore.
Not everyone can understand
the hunger of orphaned people.
Priya has understood that.
She brought us all under one roof,
she gave parents to the children
and us as support to them,
making this into a one big family,
and helped us to live respectfully,
and gave this grove to make a living.
Till now my birthday means,
me, my dad and the orphanage.
First time l'm celebrating it with
so many family members.
Suddenly l feel my world has
turned very beautiful.
Your world will always be beautiful.
Though l'm in Australia,
l don't have a world other than
my home, my office, friends and pub.
But you're not like that.
Your orphanage, this temple,
your village,
you've a bond with all these,
there's life in your world.
Sir, Vicky is coming,
where's our batch?
They'll be here in a bat of eye,
finish him before the next bat.
Think over it again,
do we need to take this risk?
There's no risk for us in this.
l hear the sound of vehicles,
see how many are here?
Two vehicles sir.
Has Don Seenu got down?
Kathi Seenu got down from it.
- Kathi Seenu? Why did he come now?
No use in packing a lone man
in boot, do it now.
Do you know who he is?
He owns Hanuman gym!
One punch and you'll go mad.
He's wrestler from Ghost town!
lf he pats his thigh, you'll go deaf.
He's world famous in our village.
One punch will make a hole
in your body.
Darling! You don't have
any urgent work, right?
No problem if you spend
few months in hospital, right?
Will you beat so terribly?
l'll not beat them.
- Won't you?
Who will beat then?
Who?
Why are you watching?
Beat him boys!
Why are you beating me?
l'm better dead!
Leave me, bloody idiot!
May you go to hell!
Beat him!
Can't take it anymore! Get up!
Sir, our boys are here!
They're not here to finish him
but to kill me.
Sir, are you running away?
May l tell you a secret?
A warrior must run if he's in danger.
Run!
Take rest, you'll be fine.
l don't like anyone suffering
or sacrificing for me.
Okay, l'll never do anything
you don't like.
But l can do what l like, right?
Do it, who is stopping you?
You!
l did this because l like it.
As anklets chime...
As hearts sing...
As drums beat...
lt's celebration all the way...
Spreading a canopy of moonlight...
Feasting with butter delicacies...
The entire place is agog...
Celebrate the marriage
as the place reverberates...
The drums are playing...
lt's festivities on the marriage day...
Conducting and overseeing
the celebrations...
lt's elders paving the
way to marriage...
lt's King and queen
in the palanquin...
As sandalwood paste
and bands...
lt's a day when changing rings
become master of ceremonies...
Turning into a made for
each other couple...
Live all the life happily...
As holy Veda hymns are chanted
accompanying marriage band....
Rock the earth and sky...
Light up the world...
The young bride's shyness...
turned into designs on ground...
Hey mischievous young girl behind
the sari...raise your eye to see...
He's very handsome...
But will not look at the bride...
No need to send feelers...
he's destined to be hers...
There's place in his heart
for Seetha only...
Won't the looks turn into
words and write poetry...
Love turns into fun and
frolic in marriage...
lt's a place where hearts meet...
Wishes in my eyes...
are fulfilled after seeing you...
l've wished you to be mine,
won't you promise to be my life partner?
l've built a castle of love
for in my heart...
l've breathed life in you...
l'll tie the knot with you and
look after you like a queen...
Your partnership is boon to my life...
Making this world to vanish,
let's be alone in here....
Turning eons into moments...
Please offer flowers and
rice on the coconut.
Buddy, it's Shiva here!
l want to meet you.
l'm in lndia now.
Okay, bye.
Not fine. You were right buddy.
l'm not happy ever since
l changed myself for Swathi.
l've gave up my dreams, changed
my habits, job and place, for her,
though l changed so much
she isn't satisfied.
l'm also not happy.
l think l rushed into marriage,
so we've applied for mutual divorce.
Shall we go?
Where?
l told you morning about
going out, right?
Not now, let's go later.
Not angry any more, right?
Come.- Where?
Our classmates!
Recognised me?
How come you've grown so fat?
- l was always fat.
No, Raju!
How much is 2x2?
2x2=?
3 sir!
So, you're still weak in maths!
You...
We must first thank Priya,
she called me so many times,
though l live here only.
Don't know how much she toiled
to gather so many people?
You're here for a week only, don't know
what magic you've spun on her,
though l'm chasing her since
childhood days,
she didn't even accept
a greeting card from me,
but such a girl has started
eating non-vegetarian food,
and gave up dance,
and it seems she gave up
her pet dogs too.
The girl who never liked to cross this
village is willing to come to Australia.
What man? What magic have
you spun around her?
l was fearing if my future husband
would understand me or not,
but when you said you love my world,
do you know how happy l felt then?
Brother-in-law, uncle is calling you.
Tomorrow at the same time
is very auspicious.
Good!
Come, tomorrow is very auspicious
for engagement.
No need to rush for it now, father.
When will do it then? lsn't it fine
if you get engaged before leaving?
What's this dad?
You said watch
for 10 days and then you'll ask me.
How can you decide before
knowing whether l like her or not.
What's this son?
Did you go out without liking her?
l did like her but practically
it'll not work out for us.
Our worlds are totally different!
lf we've to live together,
either she must give up her world,
or l must give up my dreams,
and it'll not happen, father.
Why will it not?
She prepared herself and
gave up dance too.
That's what l don't like, father.
Why should she give what she
likes for my sake and feel sad?
Who told you she's sad?
- Why wouldn't she be sad?
Won't you feel sad for giving up dance
which practiced for 20 years?
Won't you feel sad for
giving up pet dogs?
She didn't wear modern dresses or
eat meat because she hates it.
Why should she develop it
newly for my sake?
lt'll be fine now, but after marriage,
what if she feels her world was better?
Priya, think it yourself,
who is better, one who lets
you be yourself,
or change your world for my sake?
Any girl's world is different
before her marriage.
How many can boast of
such a beautiful world?
She may adjust everything
for marriage now,
but l'm sure she'll not be
happy giving up everything.
Do you mean are we not happy
in life adjusting with others?
Somebody rarely is happy,
that's why l'm saying no, father.
lt's unlike your time,
life itself has become a craze,
don't know when we'll return
once leaving home.
Wife and husband hardly spend
2 hours together while awake.
l'm asking why should one
compromise those 2 hours too?
l'm not asking you to follow me,
l grew up like this only,
l'll be happy like this only,
l want to live like this only.
What's this son?
You said you like her.
You say she's good girl
but reject her now.
l love Taj Mahal, mom.
But if you ask me why l didn't build
my home like that, l can't answer.
Sorry sister, l thought he was
teasing you for fun.
l never expected he'll make
it so serious, sister.
lf l knew l wouldn't have
accepted this from him.
l'm really sorry, sister.
Look dear, few memories are pleasant,
few memories hurt you,
it depends on us which
one to remember.
As if life is going to end here.
l know it son,
that's why instead of a girl
who thinks like you,
we selected a girl who thinks for you,
please don't go for a girl
who thinks like you,
you'll never find one.
Even if you find,
you can't be happy with her.
When l'm happy with myself,
l can't understand why can't l be
happy someone who thinks like me?
Dad will never change,
it's waste to argue with him.
Very nice!
Lady boss is awesome!
- He'll never change.
Come.
Why are you still running
around with bags?
Didn't find any scapegoat?
You'll never find one,
you're youth, you'll never find one
till you change your attitude.
l'm telling you again now,
you need to change
to come good in life.
l don't believe in changing, bending
or crouching for success in life.
One must have the thing.
The other man must need us.
lf i had adjusted with Sri as you said,
l'd be playing golf with him now.
l didn't adjust, so l've got a better
offer from much bigger company.
Who is the fool who made
the offer to you?
You want to sack him?
- No, pity him.
You can carry on, this is my office.
Do you know Vicky, dad?
Fool?
Call Raja!
- He hasn't come yet.
Tell me what do you want,
brother-in-law?
Who selected Vicky?
- Me, brother-in-law!
Despite my warnings, Bhuvana selected him.
Not me!
Fire Vicky and his team.
We'll face legal problems if we fire
without any valid reason.
What bloody legal? There are 100s of
cases pending on me in lndia.
What the hell they could do?
Not about the case, company's honour...
Honour? My foot honour!
Am l not living without any honour?
Tell him to change his attitude.
lf he refuses, talk to legal
department and fire him.
You can go now.
We don't need him here.
Pack him to lndia after marriage.
Brother-in-law...
A girl who thinks just like me
in 6.5 lakh applications?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Find me!
l won't do anything which l don't like.
l'll not meet anyone.
One must have something special.
This is a test to know if you've
that special thing or not.
l'm giving you 5 minutes to find me.
Do you've any problem
if l find you in 3 minutes?
You find a lot of lndians here,
it isn't that easy.
2 minutes is enough.
After 2 minutes, we'll never
meet again, right?
l ordered it.
2 minutes earlier.
The apple pie, choco chips,
and sparkling water you love.
We use the same brand of perfumes,
you're playing video game,
l too prefer bike when
meeting special people.
You could've told me
that earlier, right?
l know you too hate to lose like me.
Now we both have won.
l came to meet the girl, who
thinks like me out of curiosity,
but l felt she's the right girl for me.
She too does what she likes to do
if not never, just like me.
Adjusting and saying yes
is not her style.
Our worlds are same!
We met just now and dating so quickly?
ln 40 countries, 200 airports,
out of 6.5 lakh people,
only we two got selected
as made for each other couple.
More we both are lndians
and Telugu people.
A chance which lakhs
of people missed...
l can hear the sound of sky shattering
in my heart after meeting you...
My eyes have brightened like
clouds hitting to create lightning...
Ride your heart like a rocket...
Forget about the signals
on the way...
Whether it's highway or one way,
can't move any further without you...
Every moment with you is like party,
but l can't say why...
Every word you say is good,
it's great to lose in your words...
Can rollercoaster give the thrill
l'm having with you, dear?
Can the excitement ever dip
when you're with me...
Can cartoon channel out beat
the fun l'm having with you?
Time flies when l'm with you...
l can't shake a leg anymore
without you...
When you say hi online,
my heart pushes me into love line...
When you're offline, my heart
goes into hiding in coal mine...
Any place appears like
a greeting card, my dear...
Do you also get such
new feelings like me?
Any day is like Valentines Day
to me, my dear...
Do you also feel the same
while walking with me?
Whether it's dating or fighting,
my day doesn't move without you...
Hello uncle! lt's me.
How are you boy?
l'm fine uncle, it seems you said
you're not coming to the marriage.
That is...l need to attend
health camps.
Moreover Chakri has to take exams.
How is Priya?
She'll be like that only there...
l'm sending tickets,
convince and send her.
Earlier l used to remember only
mother when l came here,
now l remember Vicky too.
Dad you said what we give
is what we get.
l gave love but why father?
Will you do as l tell?
How are you son?
He said no girl is there
who thinks like me,
even if there is you'll not find,
even if found, we can't be happy,
l found her!
l'm very happy!
lnform your husband too!
l'm going now to meet her father.
Mom, l want your blessings.
What's that cap like a gypsy?
l didn't expect life to be
so exciting!
He's not the right choice,
l don't like him.
You say you don't like him
in the first meeting, dad.
l'm saying l like him after
dating him for a month.
Anyway it's me who is
going to marry.
He's not the right man for you.
This will be your idea
who so ever l may fall in love.
l must show my talent to impress
brother-in-law and settle here,
this is a golden chance.
Anjibabu, go for the kill!
l knew you'd do something
silly like this, darling.
l would've beaten them there only,
you wouldn't know my capacity
and send another gang,
and l've to beat them again,
no need, you'd lose money
and l'd waste my time.
So...
What's your problem?
Your love application is my problem.
l think you don't know the real matter.
We both were selected as made for each
other couple from 6.5 lakh applications.
Life isn't application form,
to tick any of the 4 options,
you've to take a decision
where you don't have any option,
and bear the consequences of it,
that you can't do it.
Love isn't liking the same
brand of coffee.
lt's making a coffee together!
You both don't have that patience.
l think like her and
she thinks like me,
what's the problem
if we want to stay together?
lf you don't like anything,
you'll fight but never adjust,
my daughter too is like you,
both of you want to win
in everything,
you'll spend all your life in
winning over each other,
when will you live together?
The love of parents have
no expectations.
But love in youth has
many expectations,
and you can't balance it,
so you're not the right man
for my daughter.
My foot! When people were less
and jobs were plenty,
you came here and achieved a lot,
l'm doing such a big contract
overtaking 1000 candidates,
but l don't have balance,
may l tell what's your problem, uncle?
That l love Maggie.
lf anyone tells you or
some marriage bureau informs you,
how much he has achieved
in this young age,
you'd have thought about me
positively at least for a second,
no boss ever likes his employee,
certainly not so much to give his
daughter in marriage to him.
For argument if you're right
in the equations of life,
if you get Maggie married
to a man of your choice,
can you guaranty that she'll be
happy all the life without fighting?
Matter is very simple, sir.
You must have faith to live together,
we've that faith to marry,
since you don't have it, how can you
say we're not the right choice?
l'm telling you now,
l'm the perfect choice for Maggie,
Anyone in this world would
say this other than you.
Okay, l'm saying you're not
the right man for my daughter,
you say l'm the lone man saying that,
do one thing,
my elder daughter is getting
married in 4 days,
all my relatives would be here,
you too join us,
you don't need to do anything,
just be like yourself,
after the marriage,
l'll ask 4 people
who know my daughter,
if you're the right choice for Maggie?
Even if two of those four say agree,
l'll not only arrange your marriage,
but start a new company in lndia for you.
lf they say no,
you must leave my daughter
as well as this contract.
We accept this challenge, dad.
The lectures my dad gave me,
he's repeating the same again.
l'll not get better chance to prove
that elders are wrong.
Not two even if one says no,
l'll leave on my own.
What's all this?
They say they were selected
from 6.5 lakh people,
l would say other than these two
all others have rejected them.
He won't last for 4 days also,
he'll go away. Forget him!
Got another golden chance to see
happiness in brother-in-law's eyes,
come to the farm house Vicky,
l'll take you to task there.
How could you agree for a challenge?
l didn't feel any risk in it,
that's why.
Are you all happy with me?
Everyone would be like that only.
He's mad, how could anyone dislike me?
lf he had said routine dialogues
like leave my daughter,
l would be on honeymoon with
Maggie in Venice by now.
So, you'll be here by tomorrow morning.
Our challenge starts
from tomorrow, right?
Yes Rambabu...
l'm fine... No problem...
no salted fish here or dried prawns,
your life is happy,
it seems you got married,
had honeymoon?
You asked me, right?
Why are you asking him again?
Did you ask him?
Why did you then ask me again?
He doesn't know he mustn't ask fools.
That's why he asked you first.
lf you talk nonsense,
l'll take you to task.
You're calling your elder brother
disrespectfully,
what do you expect in return?
lf you beat a grown up brother,
they'll call like that only.
lf you're such a big man,
why did you send message of peace
of forgetting past with your wife?
My wife asked only once but
sister-in-law called us 100 times.
Why should l talk to you
because of some idiot?
He's an idiot, that's why he
asked a fool like you.
l'll punch and smash your face.
- Beat him!
Not only him, l'll beat you also.
Will you beat me?
Aren't you ashamed?
Look at your age and the fights.
lf you can't stay together,
why not part in your own way?
Why should we face this torture?
- You said it right,
you threaten sister-in-law about
some job in London, right?
Go, it'll be good riddance.
l'll definitely go after this marriage.
lt's better to go to London
than see your dirty face.
Better do that if not l'll...
Who are you?
You're advising them to split
instead of staying together.
lt's better to split than
living together and fighting.
That's what l told them.
- That's all?
How many people here wish
they must unite,
and how happy they would be
if they come together, do you know that?
lsn't it right to split and be happy
than staying together and fighting?
Never take any decision hastily
seeing if it's easy or hard,
always think about what's good and
bad before taking any decision.
You'll never understand this.
That's the problem with
your generation.
Sitting in a farmhouse wearing sweaters,
looking the world through window,
please don't comment on our
generation who live in the real world.
l'm bored hearing that!
Anyways what you say
is good to read only.
Will never work out in practical.
Father!
Father?
Maggie's friend,
he's here for marriage.
They guests are Gods!
That's why l'm not telling
you anything.
Our is one family and this
marriage is a festival to us,
for God's sake never use
the word split again here.
l told you to come 4 days
before the marriage,
fight with Ram and Lakshman,
argument with my father,
l think you'll go away in 2 days.
A girl friend's kiss would
ease tension.
lt'll change the mood.
l'm worried about fighting with
3 people on the day of arrival.
l've never lost any bet.
That too for love.
l'll definitely win.
Can we win?
Who would daddy ask among
all these people?
And what would be their reply?
Someone told me boy friend's
kiss would ease tension...
lf my uncle comes to know
you kissed me,- What would he do?
He sent goons on knowing
you love me,
if he comes to know you
kissed me, he'll kill you.
He appears like a comedian,
can he do all that?
Who is comedian?
Who is comedian?
l'm Basha in my native place,
you know that?
l'll get you thrown out from
here before marriage,
and get kissed by my brother-in-law
in appreciation. Watch out!
l'll take you to task!
Tell him l kissed here.
l kissed here too!
Go, tell him l kissed here also.
Stop the vehicle, tell Vicky that
Maggie is calling him.
Take a chocolate. Go!
Vicky, you're finished!
Brother-in-law, be ready
to appreciate me.
l'm doing this to help you.
He fell down!
Would've got the kick!
l poured for him,
why did this guy fell?
Why did you fall don, Ram?
Stop...stop...he kicked me!
Will you pour oil to make me fall down?
l poured it for Lakshman not for you.
- Did you pour it for him?
You should've told me that first.
Oh my God! He too is coming!
My box!
Anji, your oil plan succeeded,
you got him.
Bloody crook! ls it your plan?
My plan?
- You said it's your plan.
Give me a break!
Why did you return it?
What's this silly?
Pouring oil and banana peels?
l'm not so foolish to fall like them.
Foolish?
Are the groom's arrangements
going on fine?
Everything's fine, father-in-law.
Father-in-law, l thought he said
it for argument,
he's really planning to go to London.
lf it happens they'll never
meet again in this life.
You tell him something and
stop him, father-in-law.
Greetings!
- Greetings!
Why the owner of Mindgame is here?
Where else would the
father of the groom be?
Maggie said she loves him.
You know him and his attitude, right?
We know but she doesn't know, right?
She'll know it.
- Not that...
Just ignore him forjust 4 days only!
He'll leave the place on his own.
How come you're here?
- How come you're here?
Brother-in-law...
She's my cousin from lndia.
l talked to Maggie,
she's just like you.
You both are made for each other.
lf you cry and tell uncle about us..
l was worried about
expecting big trouble.
lf crying could solve my problem,
l can cry all my life.
lt'll not, right?
That's why!
l lost the hope of winning this
challenge after seeing you.
Challenge?
Look, you too are tensed!
l'm thinking about you.
lf you stay away from them,
how can you get closer to them?
How will win?
What do you want me to do?
Each person here is an item! Like an item!
You don't know your specialty,
nobody can dislike you.
l'm sure you will win over them!
What's this?
l've made all these
arrangements for them to be happy,
but they're hanging out with
cell phones and laptops!
lt's work from home busy, grandpa.
What bloody home and work!
Should l be happy for
growing technology?
or feel sad for the growing
distance between people?
Brother-in-law! When did you come?
What the hell did you do till now?
Why are you staring like ajackal?
Why did your brother-in-law arrange
this music program spending a fortune?
Get the people to the dance floor!
Rock the party!
Everyone is busy with their own work...
Without any fun my spirits are dull...
Shut the computers and hide mobiles,
no need of it in marriage party...
Stop worrying about your problems
and turn your attention on marriage...
Behave like you're the chief guest...
What's he saying?
Forget it boy...
Forget about your tensions
for sometime...
We attend school to take lessons...
We visit temple to offer prayers...
We do our duty in office...
But we celebrate and
enjoy a marriage...
What's the use if you come for
the sake of coming to a marriage?
Take marriage as an occasion to
mix and cement the bond with others...
What do l get to befriend you?
World has become so selfish...
You're silent and l'm silent,
the distance between us grows...
lt's uncles, aunts, sisters
and cousins all around you...
lt isn't a daily soap
for repeat telecast...
Give your time for relatives
for this one day...
He pushed him down!
lt happened by mistake, uncle.
- He did it wantonly!
You should've seen Maggie's dad,
l felt pity on him.
l think l've already won
the challenge.
Had you come a day before,
l would've charmed them by now.
But it's true that l can win in
anything if you're with me.
Promise to stay with me always!
Promise to be with me always!
Everyone wants you there!
l wanted this only!
You must get closer to them,
only then they'll know you
and your attitude.
You'll not win.
Victory is like guest to you.
lt comes at times!
lt's like friend to me!
Always with me!
lf l go from here,
l'll go with your daughter only!
You lost the toss,
how can you win the match?
l lost the toss to win the game!
No captain would've...
- Said like that!
He's our common enemy!
He mustn't stay here after this game.
That's why this match plan!
All our balls must hit his head
not the stumps.
As your captain...
l'll not co-operate if he plays!
Get lost! l'll not play if you play!
You both keep fighting but
the balls must hit his head.
My uncle lured me into
betting 1000 dollars.
We must win the match at any cost!
ls it your uncle's plan?
Then l must play with him.
He's struggling!
Anji! l like you!
19 fours till now!
You've stopped it bravely!
lts 20 not 19! Count properly!
- That's 21!
Should it always be him?
- He's...
Catch it...
Well caught!
With your infighting
you've kicked my...
Watch out!
Like Waugh brothers,
you brothers must rock!
No way! l'll not play with him!
- Why are you padding up then?
Anyway he'll come back
getting out for duck.
You open!
Why are you playing blindly?
l'll not play if he's there!
Brother, you play!
- Me?
Touch one of the fingers!
- Why?
Touch it.
Had you touched this finger,
l would've bowled on the stumps.
What will he hit now?
How far will you go?
l'm out...
Are you waiting for feast?
Go and play!
l told you l'll not play
if he's there.
You're the last batsman,
you've to play.
Okay, l'll go, can l avoid?
They don't talk to each other,
how can they win?
Watch the ball and run!
- Okay.
Please come here!
Come...come...
l don't know how to thank you, Vicky.
lf ego stops you from saying sorry,
bonds will get snapped.
lf you cross the ego and
take a step further,
they'll understand now that
those bonds will live on forever.
At last my dream has come true!
lf you attend any function,
to share ourjoy and
to comfort in our sorrows,
one must get the trust,
l've so many people,
but now, people just come to marriage
for the sake of attending it,
but l don't want this marriage
to be celebrated like that,
so l invited all the relatives,
and arranged this,
l did the arrangements but it's you
who gave them that hope.
What did l do sir?
You've done so much
yet asking me what have l done?
What did l tell you, Vicky?
Nobody will dislike you.
l want to talk to you for a minute.
l don't want to talk to you,
leave me alone.
Can't you understand if l say no?
He's coming!
Take it out!
Get out of my way, sir!
Get out of my way, sir!
l told you earlier, you said wait
for 4 days. What has happened?
He pushed me wantonly
in the music program,
he hit me with ball in
the cricket match, and now...
send him out!
lf he stays here for a second,
l don't know what would l do.
Why did you come here now?
What other plan do you've for me?
l...
lf God gives me the opportunity to
kill anyone, l'll kill you right now.
Can't you hear what he says, uncle?
l didn't do anything wantonly, sir!
Whatever it is, l'm responsible for it,
l don't know how to correct it too,
you said if God give you
an opportunity, you'll kill me,
if the same God gives me an
opportunity, l wish your speedy recovery.
lf possible please forgive me.
Did he forgive you?
Why didn't you beg falling at his feet?
That rascal was shouting at me,
instead of beating him,
will you say sorry to him?
What has happened now?
Look, how happy everyone is!
ls it right to disturb others for us?
l'll take care of everything.
You've changed!
You don't like sweets but
ate in the music program,
you don't like to lose but
you wantonly lost the game,
you'll never say sorry
if its not your mistake,
but you said sorry today,
lf our opinions, ideas and
tastes are alike,
when l'm so angry,
how can you be so cool?
because you've changed!
Never opens the closed fist...
Never tells anyone it's secret...
Why the riddle is questioning me?
lt never gives the way to escape...
There's no reason to
say you're wrong...
Why is he excited to get
himself into troubles?
What's this barrage of questions
without any answers...
What to do if heart is turns like
a never tiring sea of dreams...
Did you ever get so
agitated inside earlier?
What happened today?
Has anything happened...
Do you feel like that?
Why do people see you like a wonder?
They show you to yourself that
you don't recognise yourself...
Though some accuse you in haste...
How will the truth come out?
lf some felicitate you
for the happiness...
How am l to know whether
to laugh or sigh...
You've changed from
what you were earlier...
ls your path changing to
reach a new shore...
lf you miss to see the
change in yourself...
How am l to believe
if others tell me that?
lf the path ahead is ridden with
thorns and if missed to see it...
we can one go ahead blindly?
Thank God! Have you come?
Come in.
l'm unable to pack all by myself.
l'm getting late to the flight.
l forgot to tell you, come to lndia
for your honeymoon.
Bhuvana wants to see Taj Mahal,
l'll take her personally.
You encouraged Vicky
because he loves Maggie.
You brought them together
when they had a fight.
You're leaving suddenly now.
What's all this?
l know the pain of losing love.
l don't want Vicky to feel the pain.
l'm happy as he nears victory,
but l'm sad for going away from him,
if he sees me in tears,
he'll feel guilty,
l'm leaving the place to avoid it.
Vicky expects you'll be here
till he wins the challenge.
But if you leave without
informing him...
Dropped everything...
where were you till now?
Priya is leaving to lndia,
spent sometime with her.
Why are you leaving suddenly?
lt's all over!
What's over?
Can't you stay back?
How many more days?
Please stay!
l don't like you going away.
l'll be happy if l do
what l want to do, right?
Do you know how happy l felt when
you were with me on my birthday?
l too wanted to be with you
on your birthday.
But l'll be here and
you'll be in Australia.
When l had this doubt,
you told me about the option of
sending recorded MMS from your laptop.
l remembered it, so...
l've tasted it!
No problem, anyway
we would be engaged by then,
do you know how happy
l'll be if l'm with you?
When l researched to find
what could make you so happy,
l got an interesting
finding about you,
do you know what you love
the most in this world?
Yourself!
l got an idea then!
lf l change myself like you,
you'll be happy with me
as much as you're with yourself.
So, l've decided,
from today l like whatever you like,
l don't like what you don't like,
when l told my cousin about this,
he said l'm mad,
he asked me how can l be happy
leaving my place and dance,
poor man, how can he know,
they were my world once,
now you've become my world,
trust me Vicky,
l'm not there without you!
lf you ask me how much,
l may not be able to answer,
if you ask me how,
l may not be able to show,
l'll keep on loving you
till my heart beats!
the more you adjust your life,
as many stay with you.
Please come, Vicky!
l thought you were just a guest but
didn't expect you're here as son-in-law.
Just now my son told me
about the challenge.
Not just two, everyone here
said you're the right choice.
You've proved that faith is
greater than experience.
l may have lost the challenge
but l've won as a father.
l don't have any more fears
about my daughter's future.
l misunderstood you.
No sir, l hurt you.
l believed winning is life.
Likewise l kept on winning
in my career,
l accepted your challenge
to prove that l'm right,
but every time l tried to
win the challenge,
l realised what's real victory
in life, sir.
l myself didn't realise that
l've changed, till Maggie told me,
when l gave a thought about it,
if it's right or wrong,
l remembered the happiness on
your faces when they united,
then l realised what my father
had told me,
you'll be happy but only little
if you do it for yourself,
but if you do anything which others like,
your happiness will be great!
Without knowing this l hurt
my father for many years,
he took it in his stride but
never went away from me,
he's father, right?
To get two people come closer, l didn't know
one of them must change position.
Without knowing that l hurt Priya.
Priya loves me.
She loves me so much
to give up her world.
To make me win,
she lost every time in life.
l rejected such a girl
as you're not fit for me.
l didn't feel sad.
But today when Priya is leaving me...
Now l realise how much
l had hurt her that day.
l thought love is what l like!
l realised its changing
yourself to suit others.
l thought adjustment is pain.
Now l know there are
no adjustments in love.
l thought marriage is between
two perfect people.
Now l know becoming perfect
to each other is marriage.
You said l gave them the hope of
so many to share joy and grief,
but l fear they may lose that
hope because of me, grandpa.
l didn't care about anyone
to do what l like,
l was very happy then,
now l don't want to hurt anyone
and see everyone happy,
l don't know why l'm sad.
Marriage is beginning of a new life,
the marriage has meaning only
if it starts with real love,
if something good is to
happen for life time,
then it's better to bear
a few minutes of pain.
You're right, grandpa.
Had l not met you,
l would've remained the same,
l thought if tastes match it's love,
now l know love is union of two hearts,
Do you know l was alone in
my world till this day?
From now onwards everyone
here join my world.
lt has happened because of you.
Father!
l hurt you many times, right?
l'm not sad, you've realised the truth.
lt's all because of you.
You're not leaving us in sorrow,
you've united us,
you've cemented the bonds,
What bond has brought us together?
Let's stay together with
the same bond.
What happened?
Why don't fishes fly in air?
Why don't ships sail on land?
We too know to crack jokes,
not just you.
For success in career,
work hard without any compromise,
only then you'll succeed,
but in relationships,
even losing to others is victory!
Because we get back
their love in return.
This is what l leant.
