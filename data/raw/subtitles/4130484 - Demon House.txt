I'm Zak Bagans,
paranormal investigator.
For the past 13 years,
I've investigated
over 1,000 hauntings.
I have a series on
The Travel Channel in the U.S.
called "Ghost Adventures."
I'm one of the world's
leading researchers
on ghosts and demonology.
And this is the case
that really fucked me up.
The story was huge.
It was the next Amityville.
And I went all out.
I had plenty of resources,
equipment, a great crew.
I thought I was
gonna crush this story.
But in the end,
nothing was as it seemed.
I fell ill and couldn't
leave my room for eight days.
I didn't feel like myself.
Crew members quit on the spot
or had to get fired.
Witnesses and experts
ended up in the hospital.
And at the heart of it all
was a little screwed-up house.
It took me three years
to finish this film.
I had everything I needed.
But the truth is,
this film is cursed.

[wind whistling]
In 2014, I had a nightmare
where I'm a spirit hanging out
with other spirits.
And I show them
this trick I can do,
moving an object on a table
without touching it,
like what I try
to get spirits to do
during my investigations.
Then, I'm suddenly
in front of a door,
and I can't control my body.
And the door opens,
and a 12-foot-tall goat figure
is standing there,
and dark black smoke
comes out of its mouth,
and I'm forced to inhale it.
[growling]
When I woke up,
my lungs hurt,
and I knew this was
some serious shit
that meant something.
A week later, a story
about a demon possession
in Gary, Indiana,
makes international news.
And a look at one
of the most documented cases
of demon possession
and exorcism in recent history.
While this news is breaking,
I'm filming a show
in California
when I start getting calls
about it.
The next day, over the phone,
I buy the house, sight unseen.
Now, "Inside Edition"
with Deborah Norville.
That "Portal to Hell" house
that we've been telling you
about in Gary, Indiana,
where so many eerie things
are said to have happened,
has just been sold.
And wait till you see
who's moving in.
The new owner is Zak Bagans.
What on Earth were you
thinking, buying this house?
A week later,
I arrive with a film crew.
A woman named Latoya Ammons,
along with her young children
and her mother,
are the family at the center
of this haunting.
Unfortunately,
they've since moved out,
and some squatters
have moved in.
It takes some convincing
to get them to leave.
Hello?
Hey, Charles, it's Zak,
did you call?
Okay, thanks, Charles.
Hey, how you doing, man?
Leon Steadman.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
how are you?
- How you doing?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.
Your friends?
Who's your friends?
Oh, man.
This is my first steps
right now inside the home.
And... wow, this is it, huh?
Then, psychic medium
Chris Fleming sends me a text.
He's heard I bought the house.
He sends me a warning
that I'll never forget.
He tells me there's
a 12-foot-tall demon guardian,
just like the one
from my dream,
at that house.
And I better stay
the hell away from it.
I should have
taken his advice.
[eerie music]
But I didn't.
I just got the keys
to the Demon House.
So I have the house,
but I don't have Latoya Ammons
and her family,
who were allegedly possessed
in the house.
They've moved away
to Indianapolis,
so we go searching for them.
This is it.
This is what it all
comes down to,
after numerous conversations
with Latoya and her mother
about them debating on whether
or not they want to talk
or do an interview with me.
They always said
they'd return our phone calls,
and they never did.
So, we were able
to find their address.
I have to go try
and talk to them.
We're in Indianapolis.
Latoya did a news story,
like, a year ago or something.
And we were able
to find this news story
that wasn't related
to her exorcisms,
about a mold problem
here in these apartments.
And you could see her
standing there
with the address
on the right-hand side.
And that's how we were able
to be led here.
This whole story started
in 2011,
when the Ammons family moved
into that old rental house
in Gary, Indiana.
They started hearing footsteps
going up and down
their basement stairs,
saw shadowy figures
in the living room,
and flies swarmed
their screened-in porch
in the dead of winter.
The local Catholic church
told them
their house was haunted
by spirits,
and a couple clairvoyants
claimed that the house
was home to 200 demons.
Then it started affecting
their young children more.
They started having
dark conversations about death
with people who weren't there.
A family doctor wrote it off
as delusions.
Then, on April 27, 2012,
everything blew up.
[eerie music]
Now I'm outside their new home
150 miles away,
hoping they'll talk to me.
Someone in there.
[knocking]
Is Latoya or Rosa here?
How are you?
I'm Matt.
We talked on the phone
a couple weeks ago.
- This is Zak.
- What's up, man?
How you doing?
Good.
I wanted to see
if Latoya or Rosa
would want to talk to us.
Okay.
Okay, yeah.
See what happens.
[tape fast-forwarding]
- It's bullshit.
- I knew it.
Oh, she won't?
Okay.
Kevin explains
they won't speak to me
because I've spent time
in the house,
and they fear things have
attached themselves to me.
Luckily,
Kevin is willing to talk.
What did you notice first?
I was told not to even
go in the house.
It was really affecting
the kids
and my sister the most,
you know.
And really the youngest,
my nephew.
It was really, really
letting him have it.
It was hurting him, you know,
things of that nature.
Then, when they came to see me
and stay with me
those few days and nights,
it was attacking them
in my home.
I heard it.
I was upstairs in my bedroom,
and I heard, "Whoom!"
[distorted shouting]
They were all sitting
in my living room,
and they started this little,
weird, evil little chant
out of nowhere.
And it started with...
my youngest nephew started.
[video game music]
He stopped.
My oldest nephew picked it up.
He stopped.
My niece picks it up.
Are you okay?
[eerie music]
[wheezing gutturally]
[distorted groaning]
[eerie music]
[distorted roaring]
We were taking them
to the car,
and then all of a sudden,
my one nephew started
attacking the other one.
And then, my niece
just starting attacking.
They just kept attacking
each other.
[kids shouting]
Stop it.
[kids screaming]
[distorted screaming]
And my nephew
looks up at my mom,
said, "Get your hands off me,
you old bitch."
I said that's enough.
[deep voice] Get your
fucking hands off me, bitch.
[deep voice]
Fuck your old-ass car, bitch.
Had they ever talked
to your mom like that?
No, they would never do that.
- Ever?
- Ever, ever.
I had my oldest nephew,
and she had him.
And he looks at him,
he's like, he says,
"Are you ready to go,
my brother?"
"Yes, my brother,
I'm ready to go."
All of a sudden,
it just started grabbing
my oldest nephew,
just slamming him,
slamming him, slamming him
in the back.
Then he just
kept throwing him.
I don't know exactly
why it chose my family.
I don't know if it was...
Do you think
it was in the house?
I'm thinking it's a presence
that was in the house
before they moved there.
Do you think it's dangerous
for me to be in that house?
I wouldn't be there.
No way I would be there.
[eerie atmospheric music]
After meeting with me,
the Ammons won't let their
brother back in their home,
because I've been
inside the house,
and the spirits could have
transferred over to him.
Next, I track down
Father Michael Maginot,
the priest who performed
multiple exorcisms
on the Ammons family,
to fill me in on
the next part of the story.
They called 911?
They called 911.
Ambulances came.
They took the boys
to the emergency room.
When they got
to the hospital,
were there still
strange things
being reported
by the emergency room staff?
Yeah, there was one boy,
was very violent.
Could you mention
about the hospital again?
Tell Lieutenant Gruszka
what happened?
And my granddaughter start,
"I can't take it anymore,
Grandma.
Make them stop.
I can't look in their eyes.
I can't look in their eyes."
His head is doing this.
"I've been here long enough.
I came to kill.
I'm going to kill now."
This is how
he started talking.
What happens next
is witnessed by hospital staff
and Child Protective Services
case manager
Valerie Washington.
[whispering, screaming]
So I have
the intake officer's report.
And this is
by Valerie Washington,
the family case manager,
dated April 23, 2012.
Okay.
And this was
Valerie Washington
that did say,
"Later that evening,
he began to growl.
He charged
at the grandmother's stomach
and head butted her
several times."
Help him, please!
Jesus, help him!
[indistinct shouting]

He went up the wall
real fast.
Standing like this,
facing the wall this way,
and went up the wall,
and then came back around
and stood back in front of us.
What did you do
when that happened?
I left the room.
She walked out.
I saw her.
I ran out the room.
I saw you, girl.
So there's the CPS worker,
right there,
admitting to the police
that's filming this,
that she did witness this boy
walking backwards up the wall.
Who else was in the room
when that happened?
The psychologist.
The psychologist
was there too?
He was there.
He had just examined.
What did
the psychologist say?
He left the room too.
You haven't been here
since the last time?
I haven't been here
since the day
after he came here.
This home video
was shot by police
doing a wellness check
on the Ammonses
one week after the incident
at the hospital.
This is the first time
the Ammonses
have been back to their home
since then.
Is everything
pretty much intact,
the way you guys left it?
Yes, yes.
Okay, so this is...
Who's room is this?
My room.
Oh, so you had
the front room... nice.
I had to stay in there.
One of the officers
that was there that day
was Captain Charles Austin,
who had been there
a month earlier
on a Child Protective Services
call.
Why did you come here
March 2012?
I'm the watch commander
for the police department.
One of the sergeants stated
that he was dispatched
to this location
to assist
Child Protective Service
and remove
two or three children
who had not been
attending school.
Upon walking in,
he saw several crucifixes,
candles which had been burnt,
and Bibles.
And he stated
that he had an eerie feeling
within inside the residence.
In my 37 years
of police investigation,
I've never run into anything
like that before.
[zapping sound effects]
So we stayed up here
for approximately 45 minutes,
and I was in disbelief.
What time do the things
in this usually start?
You said in the evening?
They don't have
a special time.
So I'm saying,
yeah, okay, right.
This is really occurring.
The officers then
went down into the basement.
And it was a table
with a crucifix, a Bible,
and a candle
which had been lit.
We stayed down here
for about 15 minutes.
And he was videotaping.
I was taking my iPhone
and I was taking pictures
and whatever.
And I said,
"It's time for me to leave.
I've had enough."
I immediately started walking.
And as I walked, I say...
"That's weird."
I don't know that much
about construction.
But why would somebody concrete
a whole basement
and leave dirt
under the stairs?
I said,
"That don't make sense."
And as I look closer,
I saw floor pan
with a candle on it.
Don't make sense.
Don't make common sense.
At this stage
of the police investigation,
what Captain Austin
perceives as odd
may be something much graver.
Is it possible this discovery
is the remnants of a ritual,
one capable of conjuring
something terrifying?
Then, in fact,
things start occurring.
What do you mean things?
What kind of things?
[eerie creaking]
We noticed when
we went in the basement,
there's actually two doors.
The one on the left that
actually goes to the room,
at various times
we were in the basement,
it was in a different position,
and neither one of us
had went into the room.
I had an audio recording
that I was walking
around the house,
just making notes
or commenting on things.
There was an unusual,
unidentifiable voice
that appeared on that audio.
They're burning stuff
all over the place here.
That's where...
[indistinct
background chatter]
I'm surprised
the fire department
hasn't been here.
It sounds like "heys" to me.
[indistinct whooshing]
[camera shutter clicks]
I'm surprised the...
[tape rewinding]
[indistinct whooshing]
Did you hear that
with your own ears?
When that happened that day,
I did not hear any voice.
I only heard it
on the recording.
[indistinct whooshing]
And I walked out of here
and got in my unit,
squad car,
and I drove approximately
a mile and a half away.
You pulled over, no?
Right, I'm in
a gas station parking lot.
And all of a sudden,
the AM/FM radio in my car
changed and went to static.
And it said,
"Who in there?"
[crickets chirping]
The home's previous owner
told me
that other police officers
had experienced things
in the house
that had caused them
to quit their jobs
and move away from the area.
I have come
to the conclusion,
because of everything
that had transpired
and all the things
that I had witnessed
and heard about,
that it affected women
and children physically
and the stronger men
electronically.
We set up another meeting
to come to this house.
Who did?
Myself, the other officers,
Child Protective Services.
The same CPS worker
from before?
No, she wouldn't come back.
Why?
She was terrified.
Something was coming
from underneath those stairs
that was causing
the whole house...
To turn.
[eerie music]
In light
of these developments,
Reverend Maginot gets approval
to perform a minor rite
on the mother, Latoya Ammons.
You basically want to try
to either aggravate the demon
or abate it.
But if it's consistent,
okay, you're not really
affecting the demon,
and you may be
endangering the person.
Behold the cross of the Lord.
Flee bands of enemies.
May you be snatched away
and driven
from the church of God
and from the souls redeemed
by the precious blood
of the Divine Lamb.
I saw she had an aversion
to holy objects.
I put the crucifix on her head.
She began convulsing.
I took it off;
she stopped convulsing.
And then I did it
a second time.
Again, watching,
it's consistent.
And did it a third time.
Father Maginot sat
on the couch with a Bible,
some holy water,
and some salt.
And he was reading the Bible.
He was just intense.
He was really reading.
While Reverend Maginot
tends to Latoya,
the three police officers
who are present
begin digging in the basement,
under the stairs.
We were digging, whatever.
He had dug about 4 feet.
The officer?
Right.
And he found a nail,
a finger nail, a clip-on nail.
I think it was pink in color.
A nail?
Right, right,
a finger nail, a clip-on nail.
And he found some panties.
Panties?
Women's panties,
women's underwear.
Also dug up that day:
a comb, two children's socks,
a heavy bar, and a red tin.
So who buried these objects
under the stairs?
And why?
Do you believe that
that house was haunted
before Latoya and her family
moved in?
If those items were there
from that original family,
it could be.
Now, I think it would be
what you would call
"necromancy,"
which is trying to communicate
with the dead.
We only assumed,
because we had no expertise,
that this was a portal to Hell.
Upstairs,
something begins to happen
in the center bedroom.
We went in the center bedroom
on the first floor,
and the blinds
were dripping oil.
In fact, they weren't dripping
from the top,
as you would expect.
They were dripping
from the middle of the blinds.
There was
some liquid material
that had appeared
on some blinds in there,
and we had no source
for that material.
We left the room.
First, we photographed it
and documented it.
And then I wiped down
the blinds.
And then we sealed the room,
and I thought,
if the grandmother
had went in there
and introduced the oil,
I wanted to make sure that she
didn't go in the second time.
So we stuck a Q-tip
in the door,
at the bottom of the door,
and then we came back
about 40 minutes later,
after Father Maginot
had blessed the house.
And the Q-tip
was still in the door.
We went in, and the blinds
were dripping oil again.
Lieutenant Gruszka
went outside,
and we shined flashlights
on the outside of the window
to see if it was coming in
from the outside
or from the ceiling,
and we could never determine
the source of that.
This CPS worker would be
the next to fall victim
to the malevolent energy
in this home.
The CPS opened the cabinet,
and she took her left hand,
I remember.
She may be left-handed.
And she touched the dripping.
- The fluid...
- The fluid.
- That you'd been seeing.
- Right, right.
And when she touched
the fluid,
a whole half of her hand
changed
like all the blood
had been drawn out of it.
It went white?
White.
It was just completely white.
And she had to leave the house.
She had complained
of pain in that,
and it did turn white.
I went on the investigation,
like I said,
at the very beginning,
thinking that it was a hoax.
The more investigation we did,
I believe
that there's something there.
There's just too many people
that I know
are truthful people
that saw things,
some of them which I saw,
to discount everything.
I was talking to the Child
Protective Services worker.
Her hand was starting
to come back to life.
Okay.
And Father Maginot came to
the front porch stairs outside,
and he stood there,
and he looked.
I say, "Father, what's wrong?"
And he looked exactly
like the CPS worker's hand.
He was flush
as a sheet of paper.
And it was like...
I said, "What's wrong?"
And he said,
"The blinds are dripping."
With so many unrelated people
finding themselves entangled
in this demonic web,
Father Maginot is compelled
to help the Ammons.
Evidence in hand,
he requests permission
from Bishop Dale J. Melczek
to conduct
an official exorcism
on Latoya Ammons.
His request
is granted immediately.
I adjure you,
ancient serpent,
by the judge of the living
and the dead,
by your creator,
by Him who has the power
to consign you to Hell.
Latoya would later recount,
this was the moment she felt
the spirit lift from her.
[atmospheric vocal music]
♪ ♪
The stories I had heard
about this haunting
were compelling,
but as I began
my own investigation,
there was just
one nagging question.
Was the whole thing a hoax?
In early 2014,
I get a call from the producer
of a very big horror film
from a few years ago.
He's threatening me because
he wants the film rights
to the Ammons story.
Due to privacy laws,
his identity
is disguised here.
[on phone]
Don't bully me around.
Do not call me
and threaten me.
Don't call me and tell me
that Mr. [bleep]
is this big-wig attorney
and I better listen
to what he's saying,
because you're
being documented
right now by myself,
listening to what appears
to be threats.
And I didn't want
to go this route.
[voiceover]
So Hollywood wants the rights,
which means there's money
in it for the major players,
from the Ammons family
to Father Maginot.
And now the Ammons,
who originated this story,
won't talk to me,
and they're apparently talking
about a movie deal.
Oh, she won't?
Okay.
Are they doing something else
with another movie producer?
Mm-hmm.
They are?
Charles Reed,
the home's original landlord
who I bought the house from
and who had owned it
for roughly a decade,
told local media
that he was skeptical.
"I thought I heard it all.
This was a new one to me.
My belief system
has a hard time
jumping over that bridge."
And the people who were
squatting in the house
when I bought it originally
told me they didn't experience
anything there.
You think it's
all about money?
Yeah, you want to know
the truth, yeah.
They had all these reporters
out in front of my house,
and I refuse
to entertain something
that I'm not seeing.
Mm-hmm.
So it's like, it's a lie.
To me, I've been here
for two years,
and I hear
the occasional creaks
and this and that,
but I'm thinking
the house is just old.
Whether the claims
are real or false,
I'd like to find out
whether they're real or false.
I'm not here
to fabricate nothing
or sensationalize on anything.
If people are making this up,
I'm gonna catch them.
Well, I'm telling you,
I haven't seen it.
You haven't seen any ghosts?
But as soon as I slipped her
fiancé some money to leave,
suddenly he had
all kinds of crazy stories.
Your friends?
Who's your friends?
Oh, man...
When they... "Inside Edition,"
it really came,
because they was at the story.
Mm-hmm.
And if I was able to...
man, I had it in the bag.
What you're offering
is peanuts, man.
They came out here,
Deborah Norville,
the other little lady,
they was out there.
The producer...
the producer, man.
Oh, man,
when this first broke, Zak,
you should have seen it, man.
You just getting
the ass end of it.
Like I told them,
and by me not being on a lease,
I was done.
I couldn't do nothing.
Yeah, have you seen
things in here?
Have you seen ghosts
in here?
I'm not gonna tell you that
until we sit down
and we sit down
and make an agreement.
You know, it's a market for it.
And I've seen the market,
with the people...
But your fiancée said
that there's nothing in here.
Well, that's her story.
"Inside Edition"
also wanted to talk to me.
But instead, I went to meet
with the home's
original owners.
There, I learned that other
members of the Ammons family
also took issue with
the claims they were making.
Charles has got me
an article here,
and this was published
February 5, 2014.
It says the grandmother
of the possessed kids
insists none of this went on.
Could this be
the other grandmother?
I don't know.
I read that...
So Latoya Ammons,
her mother is the one
that lived in the house,
that witnessed all that stuff
and did all the interviews
stating that she saw the kids
being lifted up
and tons of other stuff.
So now Latoya Ammons's
step-mother,
which is a different woman:
"My children,
Latoya's brother and sisters,
are outraged,"
the step-mother told me.
They know the true story,
and they're upset
about the family's name
being dragged through the mud.
"My family hoped
this would all blow over.
It has not."
Wow.
Wow.
Also, a photo leaked online
of a ghostly figure
in one of the house's windows.
But this was almost definitely
faked using a cell phone app.
On top of this,
I had the house inspected,
and the inspector found mold
and other things
that could have had
a psychological effect
on the residents.
So what does the house contain?
Asbestos, black mold,
everything?
Can that make you feel dizzy
or euphoric?
And then you have
to think about, too,
if any of those elements
would affect the human mind
or the body
to perceive those side effects
as paranormal-induced type
euphoria and spirit energy.
So it's something to take
into consideration.
I was starting to think
this may be
an overblown case
of mass hysteria
or that there was some other
normal explanation
that was now being turned
into a money grab.
But then,
with my own investigation,
shit got crazy.
One day, when we're filming
at the house,
a woman drives by
and says she used to
live there in the '90s.
You got my audio, Jay?
Check, check, you got it?
Did you used to live in here?
So you used to live here,
how many years?
Just stayed, like,
four or five years.
Did you all hear about
what's been going on in here?
Yes.
You guys have all heard
about it?
Has your mom
been telling you about it?
I saw on Facebook.
Yeah, a lot of stuff
happened here.
If the claims are true
about the demons being in here,
I just want to make sure
it's okay
for them to be in here,
because the other family
did have three kids also.
Oh, for real?
Yeah, except they were
two boys and one girl.
What?
Mom, are you giving them
permission to go inside?
Yeah, y'all just have
to be careful,
because like I said, I ain't
been here in a couple years.
[keys jingling]
My mama's landlord
used to own this house.
You ready?
I am ready.
This was my room.
The skeleton...
the skeleton key doors?
Used to be skeleton keys.
Really?
Not all the doors
were skeletons.
These are the latch doors.
This was your room,
right here?
My bed was right here.
How old were you then?
I was, like, 10.
Teenagers?
Yeah, something like that.
What does it feel like
to be back in here?
Oh, my God, I'm shocked.
- Yeah?
- I'm shocked.
Mika, do you ever, ever
remember anything happening
to you or your friends
or your family
that was strange?
Well, my friend Kaneshia,
we used to leave

witnessed this,

it was a very traumatic

The day before Father Maginot
was going to perform
the second exorcism on Latoya,
he experienced
what he describes as an attack
while on a bike ride.
As I was riding
through the neighborhood,
anyone who looks up to me
is staring at me
with a puzzled look,
like, "What in the world
is riding by?"
And so that was happening
all the way
to the end of the path.
And all of a sudden,
I'm on the side of the path,
thrown down.
How did that happen?
Then I looked
at my bicycle seat,
and it was 45 degrees off.
Captain Austin
was also affected.
Just two days
after I interviewed him
in the house,
he found himself
in the emergency room.
I exited a restaurant.
I was in full uniform.
And when I exited
the restaurant,
I had the dinners
in my right hand,
I was walking
towards my squad car.
I walked down the sidewalk,
and as I walked
down the sidewalk,
both feet slid on the ice
and went up
about 3 feet in the air.
I did a somersault
and fell on my head.
I was unconscious
for approximately a month...
a minute, a minute.
And I was bleeding
from my head.
Everybody came
out the restaurant.
They was hollering
and screaming.
And they called the ambulance,
and they transported me
to Methodist South...
or Methodist
Northlake Hospital.
Captain Austin would also
end up being shot
during a home invasion,
but he survived.
As I make my way back
to the hotel,
I receive a phone call
from a distressed Mika.
[phone ringing]
Something is terribly wrong.
We were out
at my daughter's pageant.
I don't know.
My mama came back.
When did this happen,
just now?
Will you call us back
after the police leave?
Yes.
On February 20, 2014,
just two days
after visiting us at my house,
Mika's daughter
attempted suicide
by overdosing on medication
and stabbing herself.
After this incident,
one of my crew members
quits immediately.

Father Maginot.
Okay, hi there.
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.
This is Mika.
- Hi, Mika, Father Mike.
- Hello.
It's been three weeks
since I got the phone call
about Erica.
This is Erica.
And Erica,
pleased to meet you.
Father Mike.
Do you mind if I talk
with her real quick?
Okay.
For, like, five minutes?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Erica, do you want to...
Do you remember
going in that house?
Remember when you went in
with me and your mom?
Like, a month ago?
Do you remember when you went
inside the house with me?
Three weeks.
That's how long it's been
since Erica spent time
with me in the house.
Is the demon
still in the house,
or have they moved on?
Do you remember
a couple days later,
things that were going on
with you and your mom?
Partially.
That day was,
like, in and out.
Okay.
Do you remember
what caused you to get angry?
No?
No.
Okay, did it feel like you,
or did it feel like just
someone else out of nowhere?
Not when I threatened
my mother.
Have you ever
threatened her like that?
No.
Okay, what did you tell her?
That I was gonna kill her,
mostly.
Okay, in her sleep?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
Do you remember
hurting yourself that day?
Um...
Do you remember
stabbing yourself?
No, I just... no.
She had holes in her wrists.
Her eyes were, like, red.
How did she have holes?
In both her wrists?
In both her wrists,
just little cuts,
like she had stabbed
her wrists.
- With...
- A pen.
And my sister is an RN.
- In both, you said?
- Yes.
Like when Jesus
would have been crucified.
Yes, yes.
It was scary,

I never seen that.
Something was wrong with her.
She wasn't Erica.

No, it was strange.

was trying to calm her down,

snapping off.
Look down in pity on this,

Another weird thing
that happened when
we was at the hospital...
and I'm not making this up,

my daughter was laying
in the bed.
And where Erica got up,

She doesn't remember that.
After news of Erica's
attempted suicide
hit the media,
my dear friend
Debby Constantino,
who'd been on my show
numerous times
with her husband, Mark,
saw the headlines
and began to try
to make contact
with the demon remotely.
After her attempt,
she called me
and told me that she believed
they had made contact
with a demon at the house.
The voice she captured is deep
and difficult to understand.
[garbled speech]
It almost sounds like it's
saying, "Something's wrong."
[garbled speech]
[tape rewinds]
Tragically, just a few months
after this recording was made,
Debby and her roommate
were murdered
in a double murder-suicide
at the hands of her husband.
This hit me hard.
I couldn't accept it.
I felt like I had lost
a member of my family.
I believe
that certain environments
can make demonic activity
more likely.
Poverty, high crime rates,
murders can all contribute.
Gary, Indiana,
unfortunately fits the bill,
with over a third
of its population
living below the poverty line
and one of the highest
murder rates in the country.
You guys ever heard gunshots
around your neighborhood,
around your house?
- Yes.
- Yes.
We live down there.
Do you know
where the house is,
where the drive-by was?
Yes, it's, like, right...
That green house right there.
A lot of the elderly
are getting robbed here,
and houses are getting
broken into.
We need to bring jobs back.
We need to get the schools
back open in Gary.
It hurts me to my heart.
The Ammons' old neighbor
told me
that a total
of five people died
while living in the house,
and one of those
was a little boy
that died in the back bedroom
downstairs in the basement.
It's the same bedroom
that Mika's murdered brother
had lived in.
I also had to consider that
someone close to the Ammonses
may have cursed the house
and invited the activity
on purpose.
Latoya Ammons's
former neighbor also told me
that her ex-boyfriend
may have been abusive.
Was he the one who had put
the altar under the stairs,
possibly trying to curse her?
I decided I would try
to confront him
to get some answers.
How far are we?
2.7 miles.
Oh, my God, my nerves
are just fuckin'...
Our secret informant who's
been on surveillance over there
just called
and said that he's there.
And right now,
I'm really tense for this,
but happy.
So we'll see what happens.
I want to talk to him
and ask him
if he had anything to do
with putting a curse
on that family.
Even if he won't tell me,
I can still just get
a good sense
of his personality.
I'll get a sense of his energy,
to see if he would be
the type of person
that would be into the occult.
This is gonna be him?
Yeah,
that's gonna be him.
- Yeah, that's him?
- Yep.
[tape fast-forwarding]
[unintelligible chatter]
I told him
what this was all about.
Man, he just dropped his head.
He was like, "Man, I don't
want nothing to do with that.
I don't want to talk
about it."
He keeps repeating
that he wants nothing
to do with us.
Thank you.
It appears to be a dead end.
I invite Dr. Barry Taff,
who holds a doctorate
in psychophysiology,
a minor
in biomedical engineering,
and who's conducted
over 4,500 investigations,
including the famed
"Entity" case in 1974,
to help me try to decide
if high levels
of man-made electromagnetic
or earth-made
geomagnetic energy
could be causing
false positive
paranormal events
inside the house.
This is the frequency
counter here.
And we plugged it in,
and it showed 60 hertz fields
throughout the whole house,
higher than I would want.
But it wasn't that bad.
Then we come to this.
Dr. Taff, what is
the geomagnetometer?
What are we gonna measure
for here?
Are these natural
geomagnetic levels?
It measures the earth's
magnetic field, primarily.
Okay, so this,
we're not looking so much
as the house...
Right.
But what's under the house
in the ground.
Right, and coming up
from it.
Right.
High levels
of geomagnetic energy
could trick the brain
into thinking
there was paranormal activity
when there wasn't any.
This is very normal.
We're getting low 500s.
This is what I would expect.
You start getting
over 600, 700,
then you have a problem,
because it means
something is creating
this low-frequency
magnetic field.
And what is it?
What are your readings?
About normal.
Everything is normal here.
Took out the 60 hertz
calibrated field meter.
Then, a few feet
away from the wall,
about halfway up my body,
I started seeing, like,
a 1-hertz oscillation.
Look, look.

Why is it spiking here

We tested the walls.
It's not the wall, look.

Why is it...

Floating right there?

Now it's, like, gone.
So it's transient.
And what was odd

It's not against the wall.
It's not on the floor.
It's not up above.

his hand wouldn't be broken up

It would all be one hand.
I'm 100% sure that is not

It's trying to draw you in,
piss you off, and...
Like, that's been happening
the whole time we come here,
is these little pokes at us,
these little things.
Honestly, I know,
but it's like,
why the fuck
would it fuck with me?
God, dude, I thought you saw
a dead body in the fuckin'...
I thought I was gonna open
it up and see a mutilated...
What'd you say?
There was a face.
Could you get any details
or anything?
I think you know
what I saw, bro.
I had never told my crew
or anyone else
about the nightmare I had
a week before
I bought the house,
where I saw the face
of a goat man
exhaling black smoke
into my mouth.
Like, I shouldn't be
really amped up right now.
I need to calm down.
I'm sorry.
Scared the shit
out of me.
That scared
the fucking shit...
I'm not gonna lie to you
right now.
When that fucking
door opened...
For a second,
I fucking screamed
like a little girl.
Did you hear me call for Zak?
I was like,
fuck, dude, this guy...
Yo, it doesn't want me.
It wants him?
Yeah, it wants you.
That shit scared me like...
it wasn't just, like...
it was like... the thing...
the first thing
that I thought was,
this is real.
Because I have to be honest.
Like, up until that moment,
right there,
I didn't believe any of this,
like, 100%.
There's something, like,
touching my hand right now.
What's it feel like?
It's cold.
You got...
Whoa, whoa.
He has a field around him.
Come over here.
I felt it on my arm here.
You're a fucking bitch.
Do something better.
Do something better than that,
you fucking bitch.
Feel around him.
That just made my arm hair
fucking stand up.
Do something
better than that!
I'm sorry.
These arm hairs
just crawled up,
like, backed up off of him.
Like a towel out of the

I'm gonna find you.
A short time
after returning home,
Dr. Taff's organs begin
to shut down one by one.
Being in overall good health,
the doctors cannot explain
the cause of this.
So they started telling me
my organs are shutting down
and failing.
All my organs
started shutting down.
My prostate, massive infection.
My kidneys, my liver,
my bladder was infected.
My whole body was failing.
But, I mean,
it was collectively.
It wasn't, like, a little here.
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom.
It was like a cascade.
Boom-boom-boom-boom.
Boof.
I felt nauseous and dizzy.
Went back to the hotel
later on, and I fell,
and then I passed out.
I started to shake really bad.
And that's atypical.
"Did you ever go back
to the house?"
No?
I said the man who hired me
went back.
He got sick.
The cameraman was there,
and he got really sick,
and I saw it
right in front of me.
And he got sicker than I did.
Started shaking, nauseous,
kept throwing up.
It's all happening...
the problem is,
it's all happening
at the same time.
That's what makes it weird.
So, you know, the problem is,
why are my organs all starting
to shut down simultaneously?
This place might have had
a more dynamic
and dramatic effect on me,
but in a way
I didn't understand
until it all
slammed me together.
If my theory is correct
that my body shutting down
is a result of being
in the demon house
just for several hours,
that's long-term effects.
I was only there
for a few hours.
If I'd stayed there overnight,
given what's going on
with me now,
I'd probably be dead by now.
Who knows
what's going on there?
You know, beside
the paranormal phenomena,
there may be other elements
that are tied into it
that explain this in ways
we don't yet understand.
And what happened with you
at the house,
what happened with
the cameraman at the house,
this is the tip
of the iceberg.
So this may provide
incredible new definition
for what is going on
in these cases.
This is a life-changing
experience,
because I never thought
this would happen to me.
After the night
of Adam's meltdown,
his behavior continues
to be disturbing.
The very next day,
he tells me to go
into the bathroom
of the house,
to smash the mirror,
and to slit my throat
with the broken glass.
He's no longer himself.
And after a couple days
of this...
Come here, you fucker!
I have no choice
but to remove him
from my crew.
Jay, my other camera guy,
tries to get Adam some help,
but he refuses.

With the effects of the house
seeming to take down
members of my crew now,
I decide to accelerate
the situation
by boarding myself up
in the house...
sealed up, alone, overnight...
and let whatever
may be haunting it
take its best shot at me.
I know this sounds stupid,
but the investigator
inside of me
wants to experience it.
Been a long time.
I'm okay.
I want to seal myself
inside here.
I'm gonna start
in about 15 minutes.
Yeah.
The last piece of plywood
goes on that front door.
And that last piece
of plywood
is gonna get screwed in
with me inside.
- No.
- Okay, all right.
That's fine.

Shortly after his interview,
Kevin Ammons was kicked out
of his family's apartment.
They claim something dark
transferred from me to him.
Ever since his meltdown,
Adam refuses to speak
with me or about the house.
It appears that the time
he spent in the house
is still having
an effect on him.
He even got the numbers "666"
tattooed on both his hands,
the same place he'd felt
the dark energy touch him
in the hotel room.
There's something

Dr. Barry Taff continues

Doctors are still searching

even Chief Miller claimed

Something came back
with him.
I don't know
