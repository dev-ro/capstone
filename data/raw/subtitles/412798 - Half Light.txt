TOY: Time for action!
Gangrene, you slimeball!
Hands up!
TOY: Gangrene, you slimeball!
- Hey, Thomas.
- Hi, Brian.
- How was school, eh?
- Fine.
(Softly) good.
Time's up, you slimeball.
- Let's go outside.
- I'm almost done.
Come on, mom, you promised.
I know
and I am a terrible mother.
- You're horrible.
- Horrible?
- You're dreadful.
- Dreadful? Oh!
Well, I’m gonna be horrible
and I’m gonna be dreadful
if I don't finish
this chapter.
So I need at least...
- five minutes.
- Three.
Four.
Deal. We're escaping outside!
Whoosh!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What did they say?
- (Groans)
Not interested.
What do they know?
They rejected my first novel anyway.
It's Tabitha king
syndrome.
Stephen King's wife.
She's a good enough writer,
but no one knows her.
All they know is Stephen King.
(Class bell rings)
They'll know you
one day.
Look at all the help
you've given me.
That's editing, darling.
It's not the same thing.
See? "not sufficiently
mysterious for a mystery,
nor sufficiently thrilling
for a thriller."
You know, it wouldn't
be the worst thing
to add a few thrills
and resubmit it.
Throw in some more blood?
Psychopath jumping
out of the closet with an axe?
No, it's not
the English tradition.
I thought a sort of style, wit...
imagination.
Darling, you have wit?
Very good.
You're the best editor in London
is that so bad?
Max Perkins saved Hemingway.
Yes, well, no one
remembers max Perkins,
and he's right up there
with Tabitha what's-her-face.
Well, I couldn't have done
any of this without you.
Well, you do realize,
darling, that...
that I’m supposed to be
saying that to you?
Hey, when can I read some?
About three minutes.
That's all Thomas has given me.
Okay, three minutes it is.
TOY: Action alert!
Hand's up!
Action alert!
Hands up!
Brian, dinner's ready.
Yeah, coming.
Thomas.
Thomas?
Thomas?
Thomas?
Thomas?
Thomas! No!
Oh, baby.
Brian! Come on.
Come on! Breathe!
Brian!
(Choral music playing)
(Sobbing) no...
no no...
no!
WOMAN: I searched
every website.
This is everything you want.
It's remote, quiet,
- no one around for miles.
- Ingonish cove.
You'll get so much writing done
it's got the boats we used in Suffolk
do you know how long
you might want it for?
I don't know.
Just whatever it takes
for me to finish this book.
It looks great.
Well, Brian hasn't
been any help.
He should have been
there for you.
Yeah, weli...
he tried.
Look, whatever we had,
we lost a long time ago.
Yeah, I know.
But are you really gonna
be okay out there, all by yourself?
- It's only been eight months.
- Yeah, I’m fine.
Would you like to get some tea?
Yeah.
I'll get you wherever you are!
(Eerie music playing)
(Soft piano tune playing)
If you're really gonna go,
take these with you.
You know I was wanting to try
it without it for awhile, Robert.
It's just in case.
(Elevator dings)
Rachel.
Shall I call Bartlett?
I'm not up for divorce
lawyers right now.
Let's just deal with all that
when I get back.
(Dings)
- ROBERT: So how did it go?
- BRIAN: All this time,
she's never talked
to me about Thomas.
She won't open up to me at all.
You've got to remember it's not
the same for you.
What, because he's not my son?
Because you weren't
the one who left the gate open.
- Hello.
- WOMAN: Rachel, how are you?
You should see where
I am right now.
- You're there already?
- It's beautiful,
and there's not another
house around for miles.
They said there
was a lighthouse
there as well?
- Mm-hmm.
- You've got one in your book
haven't you?
You can do some research.
RACHEL: It's perfect.
It's exactly what I wanted.
If I can't write here,
I can't write anywhere.
Ah. At least you're
not stuck writing crap
for a crap paper,
like I am.
It's not that bad.
It keeps the bills at bay.
- Almost
- yeah, which is good for you.
Which I don't
need reminding.
Hey, remember...
if you want me to come out there,
you just say the word.
Thanks.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna be okay.
I really... I really think
I’m gonna be okay.
Excuse me...
excuse me? Am I headed the
right way into town?
Sorry?
Am I...
am I headed the right
way into town?
Yeah, you just follow up the beach.
You can't miss it.
Okay, I wasn't sure.
Are you traveling through?
Oh, no no, actually, I’ve just
moved into foster road, number 1.
Foster road, number 1?
Are you sure?
I think so.
It's the only house on the road.
Yeah, that's it.
I'm Finlay Murray,
what passes for a police
sergeant round here.
- And I’m Mary.
- Hello. Rachel Carlson.
- So you here
on your own?
- Yeah.
Well, if you hang on,
I’ll give you a lift in.
It's a wee bit of a hike.
Thank you,
but this is what I’m here for.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
- Okay.
- To the beach.
- Yep.
- All right. Thank you.
Your son's waiting for you.
On the swings.
He's been waiting for you.
He told me.
My son?
I'm sorry.
It must have been
someone else's little boy.
Wait. Can I talk to you?
I was mistaken,
that's all.
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?
(Squeaking)
THOMAS: Mom? We're escaping outside
come with us.
You promised,
but you never came.
(Camera shutter clicking)
It's impressive,
don't you think?
Quite.
I didn't realize that there was
anyone else around.
Carry on.
Lighthouses are a dying breed.
I'm Angus McCulloch,
the lighthouse keeper.
Rachel.
Sorry, I just assumed
that all lighthouses
were automated now.
Well, most of them are.
In a few years,
I’ll be gone, too.
So what brings
you out here?
I'm researching
lighthouses for a book.
It's a long way from America
just to see a lighthouse.
No no, I live in London
actually.
I'm just out here
doing some writing.
Oh, you're in
the cottage.
It's about time
someone moved in.
It's been empty for years.
Well, you've certainly
come to the right place
to write a book.
Did you meet the horses yet?
That's a story for you.
A Spanish galleon shipwrecked,
right there, 1754.
The entire crew died,
but a few horses
swam here to safety,
and they've been here
ever since.
And they've never
been off the island?
I can think of worse.
Yeah.
Listen, I’m just
putting some dinner on.
You're welcome to stay,
have something to eat.
I can tell you
everything you need
to know about lighthouses.
Thanks, I need to get back.
I'm still unpacking boxes.
Well, look, maybe next week.
Same time?
I'll cook some extra
and if you don't show,
I’ll eat with the horses.
We should be friends.
We're neighbors now.
We should.
(Gasps)
RACHEL: "to my love in
honor of what we decided yesterday."
"Forever yours, k."
"Page 145, line 7."
"Today I begin to understand
what love must be,
if it exists.
When we are parted,
we each feel the lack
of the other half of ourselves.
We are incomplete,
like a book
in two volumes
of which the first
has been lost.
This is what
I imagine love to be...
incompleteness in absence."
ACTION MAN:
I'll get you wherever you are!
(Eerie music playing)
Thomas.
Thomas.
Mama.
It's okay, mom.
Don't go.
- Don't run, don't go.
- I won't.
Come. Be with me.
(Gasping)
(Sizzling)
Ah!
Hello.
You turned up at last.
Good timing
I’m just burning the fish.
It's good to see you.
How's your research coming?
Well, it's all right.
Could be better.
That's why I’m here.
I was hoping I could get a tour.
Okay.
How about some lunch
before the tour? (Chuckles)
Is there anything
else on the menu?
Why is it that everyone
paints their boats
the exact same color
as their houses?
Well, that's actually
a tradition here.
The wife needs to be able
to look out on the water
and know her
husband's okay.
That's very romantic.
And we also
get a tax break
on the paint.
Which is also very romantic.
Very romantic.
RACHEL: I can't make it!
Quick.
Do you ever get lonely
working out here?
You never get lonely
sitting at your typewriter?
Sometimes.
I like being alone.
Do you really
like it?
Or do you think it's
just something you've
gotten used to?
Or maybe I like it
because I’ve gotten used to it.
- I love it out here.
- Who do you talk to?
Who do
you
talk to?
Isn't that what you
love about writing?
The solitude?
I write because...
well, I don't function
very well as a human being
unless I’m writing
well, what are you writing now?
I'm not.
RACHEL: Don't tell me
you paint as well!
Oh, no.
Kate, my wife.
She...
we haven't seen each
other for a long time.
She loved it out here at first.
But in the end,
the isolation was too much for her.
Loneliness
can make you
a little crazy, I think.
Come on.
Wow!
Kate could never understand
why I wouldn't leave here.
But my father lived here
and his father before him.
My great-grandfather,
he built the balcony
from wood that was washed
ashore from a shipwreck.
This is him.
I could never leave here.
You'll see why.
Come on.
By the way,
I’ve brought you something
as a thank you for the tour.
It's one of my books.
- I had it sent.
- Thanks.
"Dreamers awake,"
by Rachel Carlson.
I'm impressed.
Is it a comedy or a tragedy?
Well, it's a mystery.
But please be kind... it is
the first novel I had published.
Weli...
I’ll find out
all about you.
Maybe.
If you need any help,
just send out a flare.
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you. I really...
I really enjoyed that today.
Aye. Me too.
SHARON: So have you
slept with him yet?
RACHEL: It's just nice to have
someone to talk to.
Meaning you haven't
slept with him.
You know,
you're starting to sound
like you're conducting
a tabloid interview, my friend.
You know me, always working,
always looking for the angle.
And you know I rely
on you for my kicks.
(Chuckles)
Is that the sea I can hear?
Yes, it's less
than 10 feet away.
- Can you hear the crashing?
- Wow, look at you.
Number one best sellers,
waves at your feet,
romance on a deserted island.
Tough life.
Rachel, I’m sorry.
That came out wrong.
Sharon, forget it.
It's okay.
Look, I wouldn't have made it
this far without you.
I mean it.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
Okay.
Okay, don't peek.
(Beeping)
Qu... qu... qu-quick quick quick.
Ready?
- RACHEL: Smile.
- Okay.
(Camera shutter clicks)
RACHEL: And no faces this time.
Hurry hurry,
come on, come on.
Wait wait wait.
It's gonna come.
- You smiling?
You promise? - Yes.
- Yes.
- You promise?
ANGUS: Rachei...
are you okay?
Rachel?
Is something wrong?
What's wrong?
I think I need to get back.
Why?
I'm sorry.
- Afternoon, Rachel.
- Afternoon.
Are we gonna see you
here on Sunday?
I don't think so.
Your man and I aren't
on very good terms.
Don't you worry about
that.
All the more
