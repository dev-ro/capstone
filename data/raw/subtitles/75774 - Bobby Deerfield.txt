Bobby! Bobby!
"To Edward. Love to Edward. "
Thank you. Thank you.
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!
Bertrand!
Holtzmann and Modave.
Bertrand!
We're being premature here,
because there's priorities.
I'm not gonna get in my car...
...until I know what was wrong
with Modave's car.
- It's the same car.
- Bobby, listen.
I went over the car
a dozen times, Bobby.
I couldn't find anything wrong.
Don't give me "nothing's wrong. "
Please, fellas, what did it, now?
If nothing was wrong, what did it?
We haven't ruled out driver error.
Don't talk to me about driver error.
I didn't come to hear you
tell me something...
...that any 10-year-old kid
could tell me.
"Driver error"?
Now, come on, what did it?
The track was clean.
He wasn't going fast...
...and there was no reason for him
to make a mistake on that corner.
Now, what did it?
What's today, the 8th?
The 9th. We've still got
three weeks until Jarama.
I don't care if we got three years,
I'm not gonna run at Jarama...
...till I know
what's wrong with his car.
I'm gonna go over there.
- Maybe something took his attention.
- What did you say, Bobby?
I said, maybe something
took his attention. Some...
Something headed for the track.
A dog, a rabbit or something.
Rabbit?
Who the hell knows.
What about Holtzmann?
You hear anything?
His family sent him to Leukerbad.
He's got a broken neck.
Hello?
Yeah?
- Who is it?
- Your brother. 
My brother?
What do you mean, my brother?
Shall I tell him you're not here?
No.
I'll talk to him.
- Hello?
- It's Leonard. 
- I didn't mean to throw you.
- Leonard, where are you?
I'm here, in Paris. 
What are you doing in Paris?
- How long you been here?
- Two weeks. You know that. 
I've been leaving messages
for two weeks. 
Don't give me the old crapola. 
- Well, what is it you want?
- I wanna talk to you. 
- Can I come see you?
- No, no. Don't come.
This is a friend's apartment.
Don't come here.
Can I...? Why don't I meet you
at the airport.
I told you he phoned,
when you were at Solda.
You didn't tell me he was in Paris.
You were driving.
Is that the time to announce
that your brother is in Paris?
Do you really want to start
having all your messages?
Relax. Everything is packed.
There's no need to rush.
And you're perfect.
You know that?
You're absolutely perfect.
Where's my watch?
She doesn't get it, Robert.
Not that I get it either.
You never answer her letter.
You never call.
But she still talks about you.
It's not easy hearing how you made
her laugh, what you eat, all that crap.
Make her laugh?
What do you mean, I made her laugh?
Your impersonations always
made people laugh, you know.
What impersonations?
Your impersonations. I don't know.
- Mae West?
- Mae West?
I did an impersonation of Mae West?
You and Daddy would do
impersonations of Mae West.
He'd tap-dance,
you'd sashay around the room...
...like Mae West, and you'd sing...
Well, you got me...
Boo-hoo, you've got me crying for you
And it made Mother laugh.
It made all of us laugh.
What did we do, Leonard,
live in different houses?
Another drink.
You don't even remember him
tap-dancing, huh?
He'd roll up the little rug
by the telephone table...
...and he'd do a tap dance.
- Take it easy.
- What's the matter with you?
- Hey, Bobby.
There's a parcel of land
back there for you.
Things are gonna be left there for you.
I don't know how you wanna handle it.
If you've got a lawyer,
or how you wanna handle it.
I don't know either, Leonard.
I don't know about "handle it. " I...
It has to do with what is legal.
There are certain things
you have to do.
How's the printing business?
How are you doing?
The printing business
is a bore, Robert.
But your nephews are great,
and they're three years older.
We have a new playroom
with a Ping-Pong table.
Mother comes down on Sundays
and watches the kids play...
...even though she can't see
the goddamn ball.
Now for God's sakes,
will you help me out one time?
- Don't lay it all on me, okay?
- I don't want to lay it all on you.
It's legal matters. She talks about
some land she wants you to have.
What's the matter? Is she sick?
No, she's not sick,
but she's 70 years old...
...and she's wrapping stuff
around her legs.
I don't want any land, Leonard.
I don't want it.
I don't give a damn
if you want it or not.
I'm talking about legal matters.
You know something, big shot?
You haven't changed a bit. Not a bit.
There. There's some pictures
she sent for you.
Tell me something.
You wanna know when she dies?
I'm serious.
If you don't wanna know,
I won't tell you.
Yes or no?
When your mother dies,
want me to get in touch with you?
No, no. Don't bring any bill.
Just answer the question, yes or no?
When the mother dies,
does the son wanna know about it?
You go home, Leonard.
Go home.
- Rabbits.
- There were rabbits at Silverstone.
There were rabbits
on the track at Barcelona.
I always said Spencer Black
lost his leg...
...because there was something
headed for the track.
I think I'll go see Karl Holtzmann.
His family sent him to Leukerbad.
Deerfield! What the hell?
You have to tell them, Karl.
No more starch in the collars.
You come all the way
up here from Paris.
That's beautiful.
You're busted up for a while.
What am I supposed to do,
sit down there and celebrate?
Well, you might. You won.
How's the pain, Karl?
They killing it for you?
Yeah, that's okay now. It's all over.
Good.
Tommy says hello. Mario.
- Everybody.
- That's great.
- You're staying for dinner, Bobby.
- Sure.
I can't understand how that man
made a mistake on that corner.
He made a mistake.
He misjudged the turn.
Tommy. You know Tommy.
Modave's mechanic.
He had some crazy idea...
...that maybe there was
something headed for the track.
A dog, a rabbit, something.
I saw no dog.
That's what I said.
But we don't know for sure, do we?
He took too much risks.
There was no dog.
I was thinking, maybe it was
the reflection of something.
A lady's pocket mirror.
Bobby, why do you make it
so complicated?
I'm not making it complicated, Karl.
I'm trying to make it simple.
If there was something on that track,
I wanna know about it.
Have some fruit.
How long are you going to stay?
What's the matter, Karl? Did I...?
Did I say something to upset you?
No.
It's okay.
I have to phone my children now.
And then I'll be back
and we'll watch...
...that ridiculous entertainment
they're planning for us.
I don't speak...
No sprechen Sie German.
I'm sorry. Could I have
your butter, please? Thank you.
I'm Lillian Morelli.
- You're what?
- I'm Lillian Morelli.
- How do you do?
- Do you have a name?
Yes. Bobby Deerfield.
You're a friend of the auto racer?
- Yes.
- Do you race?
Do I race? Yes.
How do you come to do that?
Just come to do it.
You're from America, of course.
Yes.
Texas?
- No.
- California?
No.
You're from a secret place
in America?
- I'm from Newark.
- New York.
No, no, no. Newark.
It's in New Jersey.
I don't know. I don't know Newark.
Are you as famous as your friend?
Am I as famous?
You are more famous
and I should know it. I'm sorry.
So tell me, you are more famous
because you drive a faster car?
- No.
- Could I have your bread, please?
Thank you.
Does your friend know
that you're the better driver?
Better...? I didn't say I was better.
I thought you said it.
Are you the better driver?
Sometimes.
So you know many things
about death, about dying.
No.
You don't think about dying.
But when you race,
there's always the danger, no?
Well, you don't think about danger.
- But you move with such speed.
- You don't think about speed.
So why do you do it? Drive so fast?
I don't know. Just do it.
It seems so boring.
To go in a circle all the time.
Boring?
It's not boring.
Deerfield. Deerfield?
Right.
- I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
- Lillian.
Lillian Morelli. Are you at the hotel?
Yeah. You're a patient?
- Do I look sick?
- No.
- Well, what's wrong with you?
- It's too bad. About your friend.
You've been broken many times,
I suppose.
No. Never.
Never?
Never had anything broken.
Extraordinary.
You think it's a trick?
May I sip from you?
Do you believe in it?
Magic?
No.
Destiny?
I don't, no.
You don't know?
Or "No. No, you don't"?
No. No, I don't.
Please excuse me, Bobby.
I'm tired now. I must sleep.
Sure. Sure.
It's really beautiful
you came to see me.
I'm sorry not to be more fun.
Listen, if there's anything
I can do, Karl...
- I mean, anything...
- Good.
- Have a good drive at Jarama.
- Take care.
There's no plan, then.
What?
There's no plan.
Unless, of course, you believe in God.
Do you believe in God?
No.
Then everything's more dangerous.
You will have breakfast
with your friend?
No. I leave in the morning.
What a pity.
I think it's kidneys and eggs tomorrow.
Unless, of course, you have gout.
Do you have gout?
No.
Sorry.
Do you know what I think?
I think it's a trick.
Your medications.
The rules, Mademoiselle Morelli.
Not my rules.
I'll come to death
on my own terms.
Hey, monsieur? Monsieur?
Yeah.
May I ask you something?
The trick you did with the violin.
Was there a motor in it?
Was there a magnet on the...?
On the cloth?
How did you do that?
Magic.
- Please, may I?
- May you what?
Ride with you. May I?
- Where are you going?
- Down! How far do you go?
- How far do you go?
- Go to Milano.
- Oh, so you can take me to Florence.
- No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Have you been checked out?
- What?
- Have you been dismissed, or freed...?
- It's not a prison here.
No, I didn't say it was a prison,
but when...
Oh, I see. You suggest I would
leave without paying my bill?
No, I didn't say that,
but I don't know...
- I don't know if you're cured...
- I'm fine, don't worry.
- You won't catch anything.
- I'm not worried about catching it.
- I just don't wanna be responsible...
- You think I'm deceptive?
- Deceptive? I didn't say...
- You are deceptive.
Oh, please, will you?
It's 5:00 in the morning.
You deceived your friend.
- What do you mean, I deceived...?
- Why did you come up here?
Why did you come up here?
I came up to see him.
What do you...? Look...
You think you came
to make him feel better...
...but you talk about death and dying,
and leave him upset.
Now you say you're not deceptive,
and I'm crazy.
Don't have to take me,
you can forget about it.
Get in.
Come on, get in.
If I upset you, I'm sorry.
What makes you think
you upset me?
Newark isn't like this?
- What?
- Is Newark like this?
- No.
- So how is Newark?
It's fine.
You have a delicate touch.
When you race, can you have
such a delicate touch?
Well, you hold on tighter.
But there's a kind
of delicacy to it, yes.
It must be difficult to be delicate
when death could be so close.
It's even very feminine, I think.
What?
The way you touch the wheel.
What do you mean, "feminine"?
It's all right. The best men are
always feminine in some ways.
- What ways?
- The ways that are feminine.
I don't mean that you're a homo.
You aren't a homo, are you?
Nope.
It's not so terrible
to have the qualities of a woman.
People have said to me
I was like the man in my family.
I was impressed by it.
I loved my father.
I have big hands like my father, look.
I didn't mean to suggest
that you're a homo.
- I have nothing against homos.
- That's good to hear.
I have always heard that the man
who race in cars...
...that the car is really nothing
but an extension of the penis.
Do you think that's true?
It seems like a fair question.
The motorbikes, for example.
I'm always hearing the motorbike is...
I know you're always hearing,
but you don't know anything about cars.
See? And you don't know
anything about racing.
- Do you know anything about racing?
- No.
Only it seems boring. Crazy.
And that I'm told that the car is really
just an extension of the man's penis.
- Are there homos in Newark?
- Oh, yes.
We have them there.
They're all over the streets.
We build them there.
We have homo factories.
- Make you feel better?
- No.
Do you want to scream?
What?
Do you want to scream?
No.
- Was he a close friend?
- Who?
The driver who was killed.
I knew him.
I drove with him.
Have you other friends
who have been killed?
Yeah.
Doesn't it frighten you?
No, it doesn't.
Would you care...?
Wouldn't you care
to scream with me?
No.
I think... I think I'm going to scream.
Now... Now you can scream too.
I'm not screaming.
- But why?
- I don't want to scream.
- Why?
- Because I don't want to.
We can stop over if you like.
I mean, we can stop over
for the night.
We could stop over for the night
or stop, have something to eat.
Just drive right on through.
- Whatever you wanna do.
- That's fine.
What? Drive right on through?
No. For the night.
Deerfield here. 
I'm on my way down to Milan
to check those half shafts.
I had a thought:
Is the steering linkage
in Modave's car intact?
Well, pull it out, I wanna check it.
And listen, also pull out mine.
No, I'm gonna be back
tomorrow night.
Late. So have the film there
for me, okay?
Okay. Take care.
Hello?
Me. It's Deerfield.
Oh. Deerfield. 
Listen, I was calling you
about tomorrow.
Is there any particular time
you want to get started?
No. Whenever you want to. 
Well, actually, I would like
to get going early if I could, so...
But, I mean, if you wanna sleep...
...whatever, you know, that's okay.
Whatever you want to do.
No, no, no. Sunrise is fine.
Or earlier, if you want. 
Look, why don't you call me
when you wake up, all right?
- Fine.
- Okay.
Good night then.
- Hello?
- Hello. 
- I said, good night.
- Are you hungry, Deerfield?
Hungry?
I could eat.
You eat and you eat,
and you don't get fat.
You?
Are you married?
No. You?
No. Were you married?
Was I married? Why?
You were married.
Once. For a minute.
You watch people eat,
but you don't eat.
Somebody told me
that the intestine is 32 feet long.
But we control only
the first few inches of it.
Perhaps that's why you don't eat,
it's too risky.
Perhaps.
You're a careful man, Deerfield.
- You like to pick at me, don't you?
- I find you curious.
- Curious?
- You are such a turtle.
Turtle?
Well, nobody's ever called me
that before. A turtle.
You're the world's fastest turtle,
but just the same...
- You are a turtle.
- A turtle.
I am sorry if
I make you uncomfortable.
You don't bother me.
I have musicians in my family.
I've lately thought about
learning to play the cello.
Do you have musicians
in your family?
No. I don't know. I don't think so.
What do you have in your family?
You know, you're a very difficult
person to have a conversation with.
I mean, you ask questions...
...and I don't know
where they're coming from.
I don't know what you're thinking.
Or really thinking.
Would you like to know?
Sure.
You think my hand is too large
to play the cello?
I don't know anything about cellos.
You think it's a strong hand?
What do you think?
I think...
...it's a nice hand.
You know what I'm thinking now?
What?
I would like you to hold me.
I heard you gargle.
I always gargle.
I bet you do.
Hey, Lillian?
You're kidding.
Thank you.
Deerfield. Look.
Where do you think it's going?
- I don't know.
- Let's follow it.
- What do you mean, follow it?
- In your car.
You can follow it on the road.
No, you can't...
How can you follow it?
We don't know where it's going.
What do you care?
No, no. Nobody knows
where it's going.
The guy in the balloon doesn't know
where it's going. You can't follow it.
It's going away.
Wait a moment.
I will give you something.
Thank you, Deerfield.
I'm sorry you wouldn't scream
with me.
I'm sorry you wouldn't chase
the balloon.
I hope you find your rabbits.
It's more... Sugar.
It's lovely...
- You see?
- "Everything's sugar. "
Sugar.
- Sweeter.
- Sweeter. Sweeter, that's right.
Okay. "Everything is sweeter. "
When you do the... No.
If you do this, but you shouldn't...
How? How you say?
When you do it...
...but you should not do it.
So...
You shouldn't... You shouldn't...
- When you...
- But take... It's one word.
- But take a...
- Chance?
- Chance. Chance.
- "Take a chance. " All right.
So, "Everything is more sweeter
by take a chance. "
- Safe and sound?
- I thought you'd be asleep.
Off and on.
How is Holtzmann?
He'll make it.
How was the road?
I expected you yesterday.
Did you have trouble on the road?
No. It took a little longer
than I expected.
How was Rome?
On strike.
I ran into Overton there.
He was very nice to me, as usual.
He still wants to marry me.
What's his wife say about that?
She's very fond of me.
- Did you buy something pretty?
- Of course.
Would you like to see it?
- Sure.
- Wait a minute.
I'll have a suit made for you.
Soft, eh?
Did Holtzmann upset you?
- No.
- What has upset you?
I'm not upset.
I'm tired.
Did you drive back alone?
All alone.
Overton went to Bellagio
for a few days.
He wanted me to come with him.
He called me from there...
...and he said he saw you.
I didn't see him.
He saw you.
Oh, where was he? In a tree?
We said we wouldn't lie.
I picked up a hitchhiker,
that's all, Lydia.
That's all.
Delvecchio phoned.
The film will be here tomorrow.
What are we supposed to do,
report every second of our lives?
Not to lie! That's all.
- I will make you an omelet.
- I don't want an omelet.
I'll make you an omelet, and I don't
give a damn if you want an omelet!
That's it.
Why don't you go on ahead.
I wanna look at that last piece again.
Slower.
Slower.
Slower.
Stop. Stop it.
- Hey.
- Thank you.
Delvecchio phoned with the time
of the new driver. Look.
He goes very fast, I think.
Did he say anything
about Modave's car?
- No.
- This way, Bobby.
- Bobby? This way.
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- How well do you know Lilliana?
- Well, we're acquainted. 
- Louder.
- I drove her down from Leukerbad. 
- Yes, she gave you my cigars.
- Yes.
- You are the driver, huh?
- Yes, yes.
You must be obsessed.
Are you obsessed?
I get letters from the clinic.
She say me,
she left without so much as a...
- Do you speak Italian?
- No.
No.
So they telephone to me.
"Where is your niece?" You know?
They find an...
How can I say...?
You understand?
They find an independent patient
and they worry.
I don't trust doctors.
I believe we know ourselves
better than they think we do.
I never been ill a day in my life.
Never consulted a physician
in a professional way.
I never missed a meal
through inability to eat.
What?
Good. That's good.
So can you tell me...
...where I can find her?
Is she in Florence?
- Who?
- Lillian, your niece.
Oh, Lillian. Yes.
If you're wise,
you will not bother with her.
She's difficult. Outspoken.
Like her mother, special.
Like my sister, you know.
But if you want to see her...
...come and play bocce with me.
Do you play bocce? You know, bocce.
- Yeah. No.
- No?
I will teach you.
She come to watch me.
Unless she is someplace else.
You give me the game? No?
Nobody has ever given me a game.
One person only.
And I would never play
with her again.
Oh, there is my baby.
You must never let him win.
I have your friend here.
I am playing with your friend.
Do you see him?
How is my friend?
Still driving in circles?
It's more complicated than a circle.
Where have you been, baby?
He's looking for you.
Here I am.
So, what brings you to Florence?
- Is there racing here?
- No.
No, I...
I was in Italy
and I thought I'd stop by...
...see if I could figure you out.
Am I so complicated?
You make me feel like
you're complicated.
Must you wear those glasses?
They keep me
from being recognized.
But mirrors? They look like mirrors.
Must you wear mirrors?
You want my hat?
Buy a mustache?
I don't want to look at myself
when I talk to you.
I'll get mobbed if I take them off.
My dressmaker is three blocks
from here. I make you a bet.
Take off the glasses, and in three blocks
you will not be recognized.
What are we betting?
A bottle of Chianti
and some cheese.
Make it a weekend in the country.
I don't think you could
keep me interested...
...for a weekend in the country.
- Why?
- I don't know. A feeling I have.
So let's bet for a bottle of Chianti
and some cheese.
Besides, you won't win anyway.
Oh, no? Watch.
Hey! Bobby Deerfield!
- Bobby Deerfield!
- Bobby Deerfield!
Bobby Deerfield.
How are you doing?
What are you doing over here?
Do you like it?
I'll buy it for you.
May I buy it for you?
I never thought I would see you again.
I never thought I'd see you.
When do you race next?
When do I race?
- Ten days.
- Between the races, what do you do?
I go on picnics.
And then you race again.
You don't have much fun, do you?
Sure, I have fun.
What do you mean...
...I don't have fun? I have fun.
You spend your whole life
trying not to die.
Why wouldn't you go with me
for a weekend in the country?
Because you expected me to.
Because I don't have time.
And because...
Because you are not ready to spend
a weekend in the country with me.
I'm not, huh?
No, you are not.
Are you difficult like your mother?
- Who told you about my mother?
- Your uncle.
He was telling me
that she was...
...very difficult.
- Very outspoken.
- I'm told she was.
She died in the war. I never knew her.
- Your father?
- He was as fat as a walrus.
But he is dead too.
He died on a beach.
- In the war?
- No, in the summer. When I was 13.
You picnic on my land,
but you are welcome.
- What?
- Would you like to hear the story?
- Sure.
- Is that why you came to Florence?
- To hear the story of my life?
- I'm just trying to figure you out.
Try that. I make it myself.
- Tomorrow I will fly...
- Hello?
...from these hills in a balloon.
- What?
- The day was hot...
...and the water was cold.
- What day?
The day my father died.
- Your father died?
- A long time ago.
What?
My father stood
at the edge of the beach...
...put his toe in the water,
and at the instant he did...
...he fell over dead. Just like that.
This is... What's your name?
- Carlos del Montanaro.
- And this is Bobby Deerfield.
- Do you know Bobby Deerfield?
- Oh, yes.
I am very honored.
Bobby Deerfield.
Now I... I must go.
Have a good time, huh?
Be careful with snakes.
Who was that?
Carlos del Montanaro.
Where was I? Oh, yes, my...
My father's toe in the water, yes.
As soon as his toe
touched the cold water...
...he fell over dead. Just like that.
And then the people ran to him...
...and they looked at him...
...this big walrus of a man.
Jesus, he was so enormous.
And...
Then someone put their
ear to him and said:
"He is dead. "
And then someone said:
"There's a tiny hand. "
And no one understood.
And the woman began to scream
about this tiny hand...
...that was coming
from under my father.
And they rolled my father over...
...and they found
a little child under him.
With a pail and toys and a shovel.
And no one knew
that when he fell...
...he fell on a tiny child...
...who was digging in the sand.
And it was so strange because...
...it was as if my father had died...
...and in dying,
had laid this child like an egg.
Do you believe it?
What do you think?
Do I believe it?
- Yeah.
- It's not true.
I made it up.
- You made it up?
- Was it good?
Why did you make it up?
I mean, why would you make it up?
For my circulation. I don't know.
I think... I think I need
a little surprise now and then.
Why don't you try it.
Who was that guy with the salami?
Carlos del Montanaro.
You know...
...you're playing with me.
You're trying to keep your distance...
...and you're playing with me.
You're trying to confuse me.
Perhaps.
Who was that guy?
Now it's your turn.
Tell me anything. A truth or a lie.
Even a lie is better
than "Newark is fine. "
I don't wanna tell you a lie.
I don't wanna make up a story.
I don't wanna do it.
Perhaps you will learn.
It's very much like screaming.
Who's Carlos del Montanaro?
Come on, Lillian.
Who was the guy with the salami?
I don't know.
Who is Bobby Deerfield?
My apartment is near the river.
We could finish the wine there
if you would like.
Okay?
Thank you.
My gallery, Bobby Deerfield.
Want some coffee?
I make some coffee for me.
Lillian?
Please, signora, don't smoke.
Don't smoke. Very dangerous.
We're leaving in a few minutes.
Hello.
- Deerfield, you found me.
- I found you.
I thought you might have told me,
you know, that you were going.
It's difficult to talk sometimes.
It is difficult.
To a good wind, Deerfield.
You know, Lillian,
that I made a special trip.
I did. I came all the way down
from Paris just to see you.
I really appreciate it.
You do?
And you show your appreciation
by leaving me, so I wake up alone.
- That how you show it?
- Please, don't pout.
This is a regatta.
One doesn't pout at a regatta.
Pout? I'm not pouting.
We spend the day together,
spend the night together...
...I wake up and you're gone.
You could've had the decency to
wake me up and tell me you were going.
There's the guy with the salami.
- Into the gondola.
- Lillian...
...you're not
a very dependable person.
Why don't you come with us.
No rabbits in the sky.
- Please come.
- I'm the commander, Deerfield!
I will do everything.
You would like to come with us?
Everybody's ready?
We are going to...
We are ready.
There's not many people
that I wanna be with, Lillian.
What have you got to lose?
- With the wind!
- With the wind!
I'm not going anywhere
with any wind.
You and your split-second moves.
What's the game? What's the game?
- It's not a game...
- All your freedom, all your questions.
What do you care about anything?
Do you care about anything?
What do you call this, a risk?
Is that it?
Meeting a guy with a salami
and getting in his balloon?
You call that a risk?
You and your questions.
Your questions are driving me up a wall.
"Are there homos in Newark?"
What do you care about homos?
What do you care about Newark?
You scream in a goddamn tunnel,
you make up stories, lies.
That's right, lies.
You write me notes.
"Take a chance. Everything's
sweetened by a risk. " Risk, my ass.
Remember this:
I'm the commander, here. You are nothing!
You are nothing, Deerfield.
- I'm in control here!
- He is everything. We are nothing.
Oh, God. I'm going to fly.
Do it, Bobby.
Do it.
On the track or off,
time is important to all of us.
And if you're like me...
...you wanna know the correct time
exactly, not a guess.
That's why I'm never
without my Seiko.
Whether I'm driving a race
at the Nürburgring...
...or going out to dinner
with friends...
...my Seiko is here on my wrist...
...telling me precisely
the time and date.
Information I need to know.
So whether you're
a sportsman or not...
... if accuracy in time
is important to you... 
... try 24 hours with a Seiko. 
You'll never take it off. 
I'm Murray Trid,
The Montreal Gazette. 
If I could get a few comments...
- Can I get to you later, Bobby?
- I said, let him alone.
Oh, God. Quick.
- You all right?
- You all right?
I understand more than you.
You know that.
That's why you are here.
It's been good for you here.
And I know this woman
is already hurting you.
This Lillian Morelli.
How do you know that name?
Dressmakers know everything,
especially who pays for the dress.
How long have you
followed me, Lydia?
I have never followed you.
Why would I have to?
I also know she has come
from the clinic where Holtzmann is.
I also know how ill she is.
A woman who is dying...
...who is alone...
...is perhaps concerned about having
a lover to be there at her death.
Surely I would be.
But the truth is that
she has many lovers.
And I know she is very beautiful.
And I know
she travels like a gypsy.
And her hands are small,
Andrea said.
But could she make your clothes
from memory?
Has she taken the briefest time
to consider who you are?
Oh, God.
What?
Who told you that?
- What?
- Who told you that she was dying?
How do you know that?
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
Come in.
I have been to Rome...
...to Genova, Piombino...
...and almost Cortina d'Ampezzo.
- You know Cortina d'Ampezzo?
- No.
It is so high, you must finally
walk to the top.
But it's so steep, so...
...they all wanted to come back.
I wanted so much to reach the top...
...but they all wanted to come back,
so we came back.
And you?
What have you been up to?
I raced.
Did you win?
No.
Is it your rabbits?
You found them?
No.
No rabbits.
What, then?
- What's on your mind?
- What's on my mind?
Please stop answering questions
with questions.
I ask what's on your mind,
you say, "What's on my mind?"
I say, "How are you?"
You say, "How am I?"
That's boring.
- I'm not trying to bore you, Lillian.
- I know, but...
I have a headache.
- So don't shout back at me.
- I'm not shouting at you.
I know, but don't.
I don't wanna be your boring friend.
What do you want to be?
Something better than that.
Who do I go to see about that?
Are you asking me
to change your personality?
I'm not a magician.
What can I tell you?
If you don't want to be boring...
I don't know.
Surprise me.
Surprise yourself.
Why didn't you go into the balloon?
That damn fool invited you.
God, this is all so stupidly comical.
And don't shout back at me.
- I'm not shouting.
- But you are ready to.
- No, no.
- Aren't you?
- I didn't come to shout.
- Why did you come?
To figure me out?
Again?
I don't want to be figured out.
I don't need to be figured out.
I can do an imitation of Mae West.
What?
I said, I can do an impersonation
of Mae West.
Who is Mae West?
- You don't know?
- No.
She was...
...sort of a sex queen...
...in the U.S.
I can impersonate her.
Big boy...
...you say you're selling notions?
Well, what kind of notions
have you got?
Come up and see me
some time, big boy.
Mae West?
What do you think?
It surprise you?
No.
They call me Flower Belle.
Hello, Flower Belle.
Hello.
It's a beginning.
That's my aunt Martha.
That's a picnic in 1950.
And that's my uncle Frank...
...and my cousin Bonnie.
I like her face.
I remember she used to...
...always sing a song called
"Red Sails in the Sunset. "
How'd that go?
It's my uncle's dog.
I remember the day that dog died.
My uncle cried so hard
he scared me to death.
Me.
- That's you.
- Me.
This is my brother, Leonard,
and his new bike.
He looks so skinny.
He's kind of a damn fool.
Except he tries.
There's my father.
He always wore pinstriped suits.
I remember...
...they were hard to patch.
My brother claims...
...that my father tap-danced.
But I never saw him tap-dance.
Perhaps you weren't home
when he tap-danced.
I was home.
It's where I lived.
What's happened to him?
That's a question that's beat
the hell out of everybody for years.
Although I think I saw him once...
...on a trolley car
with a redheaded woman.
Wouldn't it be ironic...
...if I began to find you irresistible?
I'm gonna tell you something.
And I don't wanna
scare you or anything.
But I find you irresistible.
Now that's the bridge.
And I don't know that too well.
In all your pictures,
there was no picture of your mother.
Tell me about your mother.
My mother was an alcoholic.
What was she like
when she was drunk?
She was superb
when she was drunk.
She'd get good and drunk,
she would be fantastic.
That's the truth.
Nobody knew her like I did.
One time, we took my bicycle...
...and we just went.
We got on a highway and we rode,
and she was drunker than...
And, of course, it got dark before
we got to where we were going.
And we had to call my father up...
...and he had to come down
in the car and pick us up.
And we couldn't get
the bicycle in the car...
...and my mother started laughing
and I started laughing.
My father didn't like it much.
And then we'd get her home...
...and my father would put her to bed
and she'd sober up...
...and it was over.
And I'd just have to wait
for her to get drunk again.
One summer...
...my father...
...sent me off to visit my aunt
for a couple of weeks.
And when I got back...
...my mother was in a hospital.
And they wouldn't let me see her.
I couldn't understand it.
They wouldn't let me see her.
She died in her room.
I must have been
about 11 or 12 at the time.
And a nurse...
...there, she told me my mother
wrote me a note when I was away.
But my father took it...
...and he wouldn't let me see it.
I couldn't understand it.
I remember I tried
to beat him up one time...
...just to get him to tell me
what was in the note.
He wouldn't tell me.
I always wondered what it said.
I know it was something nice.
Some story, huh?
It's not true.
What?
It's not true.
I made it up.
- No.
- Yep.
I made it up just now.
What do you think?
Was it good?
- It was superb.
- Was it?
It's no good, my English.
I watch you run every day now.
I need it.
Are you training?
No. I just like to do it.
It makes me...
- Are you English?
- American.
You want water?
I just wanna be with somebody.
Are you all right?
I just wanna be with somebody.
That's all.
I don't wanna talk.
I just want to be with someone.
I'm wondering about
your friend Holtzmann.
What about him?
I think I would like to go back...
...and see how he is.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Are you American?
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah? No kidding.
Where you from?
We're from Detroit, the wife and me.
I'm from New Jersey, Newark.
New Jersey?
We're not that far apart.
Hey, listen. Would you be...?
Would I be too presumptuous...
...to ask you to take a picture of me
and the wife together?
- No. Fine.
- Thanks. Come on, Ellen.
- He's gonna take our picture.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
- Anywhere you wanna stand?
- Well...
With the valley at the background.
What do you think?
Okay?
Oh, sorry. This the focus right here,
and you just press that.
I think it's all set. Let me see.
Yeah, it's set.
Yeah. Move closer together.
I can't get it.
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you very much.
- Why don't we take one of them.
- Sure.
Would you mind? Just for our book.
You know what it's like to look back
at the faces you came across.
- Henry?
- Yeah, sure. Do you mind?
No.
Okay. Why don't you stand
where we stood.
Oh, it's gonna rain.
Move over a little here.
Let's get it.
Okay. Hold it. Hold it.
There we are. Okay?
Got it.
Listen, why don't you
give me your address...
...and I'll send it on to you.
I'll have a copy made.
You won't get it until September
or December. Who knows?
What's your name?
Robert Deerfield.
Robert...
- With two E's or E-A?
- Two E's.
Deerfield. What's the address, Robert?
2162...
...Bank Street.
- It's in Newark. Newark, New Jersey.
- Bank Street, Newark. Got it.
Okay, you'll get it in the mail.
Be a big surprise.
You know, people forget
about things like this.
- Thank you.
- So long.
You went away?
No. I'm here.
Could you please
leave us for a minute?
I'm here, darling.
Do you love me?
Oh, yes.
Bobby...
...what will you do tomorrow?
