Okay, thank you very much.
We're in a very critical
phase of our war
against the coronavirus.
Our country is in the midst
of a great national trial,
unlike any we have
ever faced before.
As people
isolate at home,
video conferencing
is the new normal.
The
video meeting app,
increasingly popular in the
era of social distancing.
An app that
experts warned could be used
by governments to eavesdrop
on their citizens.
After consistently
downplaying the virus,
President Trump tested positive
for COVID-19 last night.
Today he boarded Marine One,
heading to Walter Reed
Medical Center for treatment.
What you're
seeing are massive groups
ignoring the curfews,
crowding the streets.
Just months
after what we thought
was the end of COVID,
this is a momentous day
in the relentless
march of this pandemic.
The new strain is
three times more contagious
and it has twice
the mortality rate.
As of
tonight, over 18 months
into a seemingly
endless struggle,
the U.S. count alone is more
than 1 million people dead.
This footage at
the White House barricade,
moments before the police
and protesters clashed.
As fires
continue to spread,
the air quality in many
U.S. cities declines
to evermore dangerous levels.
The increasing
tension resulting in greater
and greater violence.
January 13, 2022,
the death toll now
at 12.3 million,
as the second strain of the
virus continues to spread.
We ask you to follow
the guidelines
of no groups coming
together of more than 10,
and if anyone in the
household is sick,
that everyone quarantines
in the household together.
The third major
strain of the coronavirus
has brought the total to 31.2
million American lives lost.
To bring back order and slow
the spread of the disease,
increasing penalties
have been set
for those breaking the
strict nationwide curfews.
Sooner or later,
the pandemic has to end.
It's not a crisis
like a hurricane or 911,
where it's bound by time and geography.
It feels indefinite.
It takes a toll on people
in a very real way,
to be stuck inside, unable to
do the things they wanna do
or go places they're used to.
Dr. Lauren Fisker is
a researcher at Johns Hopkins.
In Los Angeles, California,
newly appointed police chief,
Charles Yates, mandated a new
earlier curfew this month,
citing worsening
numbers in the city.
Anyone caught outside
their designated neighborhoods
past curfew, without specific
credentials, will be arrested
and held in a detention center.
Harper, hey, girl.
Holy shit, that picture
you started was crazy.
What happened to the
Salt Lake barbecue?
Oh my God, the whole
block burned down.
- Wow.
- Yeah,
it's my late night go to.
RIP.
Austin's turning into
a fucking ghost town.
Yeah.
What city isn't, right?
Yeah, so where's Evan?
Why did you wanna
get me on early?
- I have some news.
- Did he propose?
No.
So what happened?
Alright, but you have to promise
not to tell anyone, especially Evan.
I may have known him
longer, but, girl,
you know I would take you
any day in the divorce.
Yes, okay...
I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant?
- Shh.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Wait, okay, so
Evan doesn't know?
No, I'm gonna tell
him after the party,
but I didn't want
him to stress out,
but I had to get it out.
Oh my God, I'm so
happy for you guys.
Oh, shit, okay,
he's coming, just...
Okay, yeah, I'll snooze you.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hello.
And my phone is dead.
- You want anything?
- Nope.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey, oh, I miss those faces.
- Hey, girl.
- Oh, you forgot the wine.
- One sec.
- Hold on.
Aw, they look good, huh?
Yes, there we go.
- Hey, careful.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah, how are
you two holding up?
- Oh, God, the same.
- The exact same.
Oh, except Central Park is now
a giant makeshift hospital,
so that's great.
Anyway ,
happy birthday, Evan.
Oh my God, how excited are you?
- Yes.
- Another birthday.
- Oh.
- Hey, Harper.
Austin to the TX, what's up?
- No, take your time.
- Yeah, we can wait.
It's fine, we have
nothing to do.
Oh.
How are you guys doing?
I'm kidding.
You know I know how you are.
We gettin' white girl wasted
up in here.
I don't know what this is.
- I can do that.
- You guys,
look what I found.
- Oh my God.
- Oh, man.
Where...
Oh my God,
where did you find it?
Where'd you dig that up?
I literally organized
and cleaned everything.
- High school.
- Evan, look at your hair.
- I know, high school.
- He was a baby.
Wow, I didn't have
any good role models.
Yeah, he definitely
went through one
or two phases with the hair.
Harper, can you send me
a copy of that,
and maybe send one to
everyone else in the group?
Oh, yeah, not a problem.
You know that's coming.
Oh, first, you guys,
what is up with these things?
- Yeah, what is this?
- I don't know.
- What is hers?
- Oh, no idea.
- No clue.
- I don't know.
Ah, Mia, Mia, hi.
Where's Oliver?
We want to open these.
- What's going on?
- Yeah, what is happening?
I honestly don't know.
This is his thing.
Bitches, no,
don't start without me.
- Oh my God.
- Are you okay?
You start without me?
- Jesus.
- No, okay.
- Happy birthday, Evan.
- Happy birthday, Evan.
And a one, and a two,
and a one, two, three.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Evan ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- That was good.
- That's very good.
- I thought that was good.
- Yeah, that was touching.
You all should do a live concert
and relieve yourselves
from that.
In other birthday news, Jen made
us our very last freezer rib eyes.
- Fancy.
- Then she came to our room
wearing nothing but
my varsity jersey.
What the fuck?
No, no, no, no, no, okay,
all right, that's cool.
And then we watched
his favorite movie.
- Point Break.
- Yes.
Fire.
- Sick.
- Straight movie.
- Come on, guys.
- It was a very special day.
- I loved it.
- Good.
Right up until Antonio
saw us grilling
and guilted us into
going back inside.
Dude, that guy's such a dick.
- Wait, who is Antonio?
- He's their neighbor and an ex-cop.
Yeah, and he's been
so bored, that lately,
he just reports
every little thing
that's slightly out of place.
All right, Ollie,
I can't wait anymore.
- What is going on?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Okay,
so obviously Vegas
couldn't happen again.
- Will it ever happen?
- Well, stay tuned,
my friends, 'cause that's
what we're doing here today.
We're taking the Vegas party
that you all thought was dead,
and we're bringing it
right here, right now,
because it is very much alive.
- What is that face?
- Nah, you'll see.
Okay, and open them.
- Open them.
- All right, all right, all right.
- Oh, they're so cute.
- What is this?
- Really?
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Have these been sterilized?
Oh, come on,
I thought it was gonna be
something better than this.
Keep digging.
Oh.
Oh,
so drugs?
- Oh, this is so cute.
- Wait, what is this?
Like molly or something?
You're goddamn right it's molly.
One for each one of you to
stick into those gorgeous faces.
Got it from my guy
in the valley,
but he got it shipped in
from Japan.
But do they put those little
hearts on them over there?
Yes, they do.
This is designer shit.
It's impossible to get anywhere,
especially now.
Look at that.
- We're in.
- We're in.
What's up, Ben?
Well, Mia,
you're cool with this?
Why wouldn't I be?
We're all a team now, right?
Can we talk?
Wait, either we all do this
or none of us do.
- We expand our minds together.
- Yeah.
Very well put, professor.
No, no, no, come on,
I can bow out.
You guys can still take them.
- You could bow out, by the way.
- Come on, don't start, baby.
I'm just saying.
Okay, guys,
I guess we have to pass.
- Thank you, though.
- What, what the fuck?
- No.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Ben.
- Ben.
Stop, no, you guys
don't understand how hard it was
for me and my partner
during this whole thing.
- Please, Ben.
- I can't.
There's no interacting
with colleagues in real life.
There hasn't been any
interacting with colleagues
in real life in forever,
and that's exactly how long
there hasn't been any
drug tests, so you're fine.
- Yeah.
- What is it?
The thing that happened
between you two guys?
- Ollie, Ollie.
- We all talk.
Everyone knows.
Yeah, we all talk.
- They're my best friends.
- Yeah,
- and it's not a big deal.
- Ben,
personally I see
your side of it.
Ben, Ben, tonight
is about forgetting.
Well, I thought it
was about my birthday?
Shut up, Evan.
It's about forgetting
about all the shit
that's out of our control.
Don't you want to let go of
all of it, just for one night,
with no consequences?
Yeah, be like Harper,
she eats that shit for breakfast.
- Mm, maybe.
- Yeah, it's true
and look at me.
You're gonna make a
great nurse, Harper.
Thank you.
- Oh my.
- Please?
- Okay, fine.
- Yay.
- Yes.
- Yay.
♪ Open it up, open it up ♪
- All right.
- Y'all ready?
- Yup.
- Yah.
Okay, here we go, and a
three and a two and fuck it.
Whoa, I feel like
I'm floating on air.
- Oh my God.
- One with everything.
Okay, all right, all right,
obviously it's going
to take a second,
ladies and gentlemen and Keanu.
Okay, and now, welcome to Vegas.
I love it.
You two had to
have planned this.
- No, we didn't.
- No.
Yo, Oliver, you and I are cut
from the same cloth, dude.
Guys, after all this time,
we finally made it.
All right, so what should
we do to kill time,
AKA take Ben's mind away
from his ever mounting
drug-addled regret?
Well, I am going to go
get some more alcohol.
That's classy.
- Jeez.
- Ah, Harper, nurse's opinion.
Will red wine prevent me
having a heart attack?
I'm asking for a
friend, obviously.
Well, yeah,
it's like science, right?
So Ollie, did she move in?
It's kind of fast.
- We're co-quarantine.
- Is your divorce final?
- Oh, kitty likes to scratch.
- What?
I just wanna know.
The legal stuff
is taking forever.
Seriously though, is it?
The legal stuff is taking
forever, which is understandable.
I'm just glad
she's in a safe place.
We really miss Rachel.
Yeah, can we have
her back, please?
There's no talking about Rachel.
There's no talk about Rachel.
Okay, okay, what was it,
what was it?
- Her beautiful body?
- Or that long black hair?
Yes, thank you for reminding me.
She broke up with me,
and thanks for the support,
by the way.
You never...
- Hey, you.
- Hi, honey.
Okay.
All right, so let's
get this party started.
- We brought Pictionary.
- Are you joking?
- Really?
- No, no,
Pictionary is fine.
Yes, it's my favorite game
to play with my friends
- on molly in Vegas.
- Oh, okay, you know what?
- That's enough of that.
- Oh, come on.
Come on, dude, it'll be fun.
All right, all right,
let's do it.
- Okay.
- Okay, who goes first?
Obviously the birthday boy.
Yeah, everyone get
markers and paper.
Okay, and everybody
close your eyes,
- except for Evan.
- Markers and paper.
- You got it?
- Ready?
- Okay.
- All right.
- Got it.
- Evan.
Okay, got it, got it, got it.
- And...
- Open?
Go, yeah, open, go.
- Oh, house.
- Park?
- Apartment?
- Fire Island beach cottage.
You slut.
- That's what it looks like.
- Person?
- Penguin?
- Person.
- Woman's work, housework. It's housework.
- Woman's work.
It's Harper, it's Harper.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, I get it,
'cause she's all alone.
- Oh, lonely Harper.
- Doh.
- Okay, yeah, yeah.
- It is Harper.
- I love you.
- You guys, that's fucking cold.
- Whatever.
- It is cold in your house.
That's not what was on the
card, for the record, okay?
- How's Patrick?
- Wait, who's Patrick?
- He's her old roommate.
- Patrick, yeah.
He's hanging in.
His dad got corona and passed,
and so he went to go take care
of his mom a while ago now.
Guess all we can do right now
is be with the ones
we love, right?
Yeah, he and his fiancé
had to cancel their wedding
four times, and it
finally did them in.
Now he's stuck in the
middle of nowhere, Kansas,
if you can imagine?
Not that it matters where
you are anymore, right?
- And we fought all the time.
- Question?
What's going on with the apps?
Can we please live
vicariously through you?
Well, okay, guys will
forever be in two camps,
aggressive and horny
and desperate.
- That's you.
- Or, you know what?
They want to move right in
because it sucks doing this
fucking quarantine alone.
- That's me.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Well,
I think it's always better
to meet someone in real life.
Yeah, and how does that
even happen anymore?
Ollie and I met on the street,
in front of my place.
He walked by almost every night.
It took me months to see
what was behind her mask.
- Oh, God.
- Well,
look on the bright side.
At least you're not
stuck homeschooling kids
or trapped in the same house
with the same face over
and over and over.
Yes, we started to despise
one another this week,
just a little.
These drugs are...
- They're strong.
- He keeps trying
- to get me to read.
- Yeah.
- What is it?
- They're coming on fast.
- The Republic.
- The Republic.
- Ew.
- Ick on The Republic?
Yes, ick on The Republic.
I don't even know what it is.
Plato, it's Plato.
Yeah, thank you, it's only
the most important piece
of literature that has
survived for 2000 years.
Oh my God, stop it.
- It's a...
- Yo, I love this song.
- Oh, yeah.
- Turn it up.
It's a Plato set.
Music brings the
soul to the mind.
I love this song too.
- Light to the imagination.
- Hey, hey,
- should we?
- Ah, yeah, dance battle?
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, I think we should actually.
- I think we fucking should.
- Oh my God.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- You win.
- I won as usual.
Well, I think we
can say we are done
with the dance battles.
- So now what?
- Oh, I have an idea.
How about we play a game,
where we point out all
of your insecurities?
- Sorry.
- Or whatever.
- The truth hurts, okay.
- By the way,
are you guys feeling this,
'cause I'm...
- Me, me, I am.
- Oh my God,
- my heart is racing.
- Yes, mine too.
Evan, you were right.
This shit is strong.
I feel like I can
run a marathon.
- Oh my God.
- Okay, big guy, we get it.
- Very, very impressed.
- Yeah, show off, my God.
I do feel pretty fucking great.
Hey, that's the spirit.
- Look, we got him.
- Woo.
I had you on here.
- Put it down.
- Oh, come on.
It's after midnight on a Friday.
- What could be this urgent?
- Just ignore it.
No, no, you know what?
I'm going to tell my senior
partner to take this email.
- He can shove it.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.
- Don't, no, no, no.
- Don't do that.
- It's not funny.
- Give it.
- No, sorry.
- Breathe, breathe.
- All right,
definitely time
for another game.
How about Fuck, Marry, Kill?
- Whoa.
- Yes.
That's like the worst game
you could possibly play
- with a group of friends.
- Yeah, no way.
Well, I would fuck Evan,
marry Oliver and kill this.
Stop it.
- I wasn't going to say you.
- Okay, okay,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
How about Never Have I Ever?
- I'm into that.
- Sure.
Yeah, it's low stakes for
someone who's new to the group.
Okay, well, we'll be best
friends in no time, don't worry.
I'll start, yeah, yeah.
Okay, three fingers,
and if you've done something,
you have to put
your finger down.
Yeah, we've played the game.
Are you explaining
how to play this game?
Never have I ever.
Okay, so I'll go first.
Never have I ever
had a one night stand.
- Come on.
- Yeah, right.
- Are you fucking...?
- No way.
I'm not lying, I swear.
Okay, okay, never have I
ever slept with two people
in one day?
- What can I say?
- What?
- Oh, what?
- When?
In high school.
Was it like a morning
and a night thing?
Like wake up with one,
go to sleep with another?
- No.
- Oh,
- so someone had a threesome.
- Jen.
Hold on, wait.
You never told me about this.
What, it was so long ago.
- So who were they?
- Yeah.
- Ah, two guy friends.
- Two guys?
What difference does it make?
It's totally different.
Oh, Evan, come on.
- I wouldn't have thought.
- Yeah,
this is why I don't
tell you things.
Okay, I think we need to
change gears again, yeah?
- Yeah, yes, please.
- Yeah, let's, let's, let's.
Oh, I'm really feeling this.
People right here,
we can see you.
See, Rachel never
would have done this.
- This is fucking...
- Jen, Jen, Jen.
You're not on mute.
- Oh.
- Well,
good thing she isn't here
or you guys would miss out.
Come here.
- Sick.
- Two guys?
- What, it was high school.
- Oh my God.
Okay, you know what?
You know what,
like you haven't had a past?
I guess, but I want to be able
to share all of that with you.
Oh, you want to be able
to share things with me?
Okay, so you want to
share a threesome with me?
All right, Harper, hey,
so are you busy later?
You want to like hook up with us
or something?
- No.
- Oliver?
Oliver, yo.
Yeah, you're interested?
Great, hey, look, there we go.
- All right.
- You're welcome.
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, yeah.
Oh.
Oh, okay,
does anyone else feel like
they're watching a music video
or they're trying not to?
Yeah, I feel like
there's things.
Guys, this stuff
is really strong,
or I'm high still maybe,
or both.
I feel like I need to
get out a lot of energy.
- Does anyone else?
- Yes, yes.
- Same here.
- I feel really jittery.
No, you're just overthinking.
No, that's not normal, is it?
- It's fine.
- I don't know.
Maybe it's all of this?
- It's fine.
- No,
I've seen people on molly.
This doesn't seem like that.
Yeah, I don't know what this is.
- Co-quarantine.
- Best idea ever.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, Christ, seriously.
Oh, come on.
Oh my God, she's ridiculous.
Okay, you want to record it,
then you can save it forever,
- you know?
- What?
My body feels weirdly
and I don't like it.
Baby, just breathe, okay?
You've gotta let it happen.
Come on, or you're in
for a very long run.
You want me to embrace it?
I just said I don't like it.
Honey, hey, you're gonna
be okay, I promise.
- No, don't be dismissive.
- I'm not.
I'm trying to help you relax.
And you're not helping, are you?
Okay, Liam, Liam, Liam.
- Just give him a beat, okay?
- Yeah, seriously, dude.
He's fine.
Hey, he's gonna be fine,
all right, and he always gets...
Come here, come here.
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?
Come on, you're really
freaking out, aren't you?
Hey, I shouldn't have
helped them convince you.
I thought you could
use the escape.
I'm sorry, okay?
- This was my fault.
- No, it's my fault.
Every time this
group gets together,
some ridiculous shit happens
that I have to deal with,
and most of the time,
I have to clean up.
- Hey.
- Well, you're the lawyer.
- That's not funny.
- Hey, Liam, Liam.
- I'm done.
- With what?
The group?
You guys, are you really going
to do that in front of us?
- I mean, come on.
- She's fucking ridiculous.
- Oh my God.
- Whoa, I'm sorry.
No, you're right.
This is not the place for that.
Yeah, it's fucking weird.
I didn't even realize.
To the bedroom.
- Yes, go.
- Come on, daddy.
- You're bad.
- You love it.
- I really do.
- Classy.
- Keep the camera on.
- Try and stop me.
Jesus.
Come on,
what are you doing?
You know
what we're doing.
We're adding a little
excitement to the evening.
Now we've got a party.
Come on,
seriously, guys.
- This is gross.
- That was really amazing.
You guys ready for a show?
Yeah, guys, are you?
Ah, well, this just
got interesting.
- Seriously?
- Perverts.
Oh, that's no fun.
I was just starting
to get into that.
You were starting to get into
watching your two friends
have sex, but, oh, no,
you're just weirded out
about some shit
I did in high school.
- I was kidding.
- Okay, didn't seem like it.
- Hey, come on.
- Don't, don't, don't.
Don't what?
Just don't do that
right now, okay?
Do what right now?
Be playful?
Want my girlfriend?
Jen, it has been 10 years.
Oh, Jesus.
Should be happy that I
still want you every day.
What did you just say to me?
What I'm saying is
that it would be nice
if sex were more than
just a birthday present.
Whoa, come on, Evan.
No, yeah, let's talk about this.
Okay, all right, let's talk.
I'm sick of getting
treated like this, okay.
I do something nice for you
and then you get all
fucking weirded out
about something I did
15 years ago.
I think that's
the drugs talking.
No, no, it's not
the drugs, Evan,
- 'cause I didn't...
- Way to ruin the party.
Oh, so this is my fault?
I didn't ruin the
fucking party, Evan.
You ruined the party when
you got all butt hurt
about something that
happened 15 years ago, yeah.
Fuck that, all right.
Stop trying to control me.
Stop trying to
control everything.
You guys, come on,
just let it go.
You know what, maybe you should
try to control the effort
that you put into
our relationship?
Oh my God, are you
fucking kidding?
You do not want to go
there with me, okay.
You want to talk about effort?
Effort is more than
your desire, Evan.
Why don't you do something
to make me desire you?
Like, I don't know, do something
nice for me, like once.
Brush your teeth,
workout, dress nice.
It's quarantine, Jen.
What does it matter?
Thank you for proving my point.
It does matter.
It matters to me and all
of them notice it, okay,
and this is all we talk
about when you're not here.
Oh, which by the way,
is fucking never,
because we're stuck together.
You know what? When we first
met, you were so different,
and then this all happened,
and now I'm stuck here,
and I was so
excited to tell you.
- I was...
- What?
Tell, Jen, what?
Jen?
- Jen?
- Evan...
Baby, come on.
Talk to me, Jen, Jen.
Oh, please, please, no,
Jen, Jen, Jen, come on.
- You can't...
- Oh my God.
Jen?
- Oh God.
- Evan.
Oh, Jen.
Come on.
Ben, Liam.
- Hey.
- Oh my God.
- Hey.
- She's bleeding a lot.
- Fuck, come on.
- What's going on?
Harper, what happened?
I didn't see it.
I heard a crash and now
Jen's on the ground.
- Jen, Jen.
- What are they saying?
Oh God, oh God, oh my God.
Jen, wake up, baby, wake
up, wake up, please?
- Evan, what did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
- I didn't even touch her.
- Evan, come talk to us.
Come here.
Baby, come on.
- Hey, talk to me.
- Evan, come here.
- Hey.
- Evan.
She's not breathing, okay?
Just try and calm down, okay?
Calm down?
- Are you kidding?
- What the fuck?
Hey, Jen, wake up, come on.
Jen, hey.
- Hey.
- Just tell us what you see.
Nothing.
She's not breathing.
I don't...
Hey, baby, come on.
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do?
Lift her head gently and
see if you can find a wound.
Is it still bleeding?
She hit her head near
the base of her skull.
Okay, okay, check her airway.
Baby, come on, please.
Come on, talk to me.
She's not breathing.
She's just limp.
Fuck, come on,
wake up, baby.
Come on, you can wake up please.
You guys missed
something real special.
Ollie, please, just
tell me something.
What do you see?
What's happening?
- Jen.
- Harper?
What happened to Jen?
You guys, there was a crash
and now she's on
the fucking ground.
- Oh my God.
- What?
- Oh my God.
- Come on, talk to me, Jen.
Evan, what did you do?
- I didn't see it.
- Ben, what happened?
We don't know,
we weren't listening.
We had you guys on mute.
Evan, can you at least
come grab the phone
and just show us what happened?
Evan come here.
Oh God, oh God.
Evan, come here. Fuck!
Evan, I need you
to grab the phone
and show us what's happening.
Evan, listen to her.
Evan come on, come on.
Evan!
Hold on.
Oh my God.
Show me the back of her head.
No.
Oh God.
Oh my God, I have
to go over there.
I don't hear a heartbeat.
Are you sure?
Am I sure?
No, I'm not sure doctor,
but she hasn't moved in
the last two minutes.
Oh God, how is this possible?
Hey man, don't panic, okay?
Stop.
She's dead.
We have to call an ambulance.
No ambulance is gonna come
with everything that's going on.
What good is an
ambulance gonna do?
They won't send an ambulance,
they'll send the police.
She's dead.
Okay, but we have
to do something.
He'll end up in a
detention center or worse?
They'll think he killed her.
So...
Evan muted us.
- I have to go over there.
- No, you're not leaving me.
Well, we're the only
ones anywhere near him.
And what are you gonna do?
You're gonna drive when
we've been drinking
and you're on drugs
and it's past curfew?
I need to help my
friend, he's in trouble.
No.
Evan, Evan? Will you
talk to us please Evan.
Evan?
He's not
listening to us.
Okay. Harper, Harper,
just tell us exactly
what happened, okay?
Okay, well, you two were
fucking and then logged off.
Yes Harper, after that.
They were fighting and...
and it got super heated
and I heard a crash,
and then Jen was on the ground.
I didn't see it.
That sounds nothing like them,
they never fight.
Are you sure?
You didn't see anything else?
- That's all you saw?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure, Ollie.
Ben and Liam were in
their own little drama
and then I was trying
to avoid Jen and Evan,
and if drugs aren't
making this any clearer,
I don't know.
Something happened
and now she's dead.
- I'm going over there.
- Oliver?
He's my best friend.
I'm the only one who
can help him right now.
When he unmutes,
tell him I'm on my way.
Oliver, you can't...
You guys, I don't get it.
He would not
intentionally hurt her,
- I know that.
- Yes, I know.
I think the drugs
had something to do...
This is why I don't
do this kind of stuff.
Can you just calm down?
Calm down? Come on,
she's fucking dead.
This is insane.
Please, I'm begging you.
I can't, I can't.
What was that?
- What?
- Fuck, fuck.
Oh my God, what was that?
I know
you're in there.
Fuck. Antonio.
I heard yelling. Hey.
Don't. Fuck!
Yo, Evan! Evan!
Come on, I saw
you turn the lights off.
- Hey, Evan.
- Hey.
I heard you two arguing.
What's going on in there?
Sorry, we were
watching a scary movie.
Do you think he saw her?
Oh, no, no way.
He would have said something.
What is Evan gonna do?
It really didn't sound like
you were watching a movie.
What do you mean it
didn't sound like a movie?
And why are you always
snooping around?
I think he's gonna leave.
What was that?
Jen? You all right there?
We're in quarantine.
See, it's not good
for somebody your age
to be out here right now, okay?
I'm not feeling too well,
so you need to go.
- You don't look so good, Evan.
- Good night, Antonio.
All right, fine.
Have it your way.
Evan, what are you...
Hey, talk to us,
what are you doing?
- Evan, can you come talk to us?
- Evan?
Hey, how
can we help you?
- Evan? Evan?
- Evan
Come here.
What do you...
Did he see anything?
I don't think so.
Since
when do you smoke?
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, I'm back on.
I'm heading over to
you, I'm five out
Man, I don't know what to do.
I should have done something.
I should have been able to help.
Honey, honey.
There was so much that
I wanted to do with her,
so many things I wanted to say.
What? Harper?
Yeah, what is it?
Come on, spit it out.
You're doing that thing with your lips,
we're not idiots.
Come on Harper, what is it?
- Harper?
- Harper?
- Jen was pregnant.
- No.
Fuck.
Do not do that.
Don't do that.
Evan, she told me tonight.
No! If that were true,
I would have known
about it already.
How could you possibly know?
My God, why would she do molly?
She didn't take it.
I know that she didn't.
We had a moment earlier
when we were all cheers-ing.
I know that she didn't take it.
She... she did that
thing where she...
Wait, what thing?
Whenever she doesn't
want to take a shot,
She spits it in the bottle.
Yeah.
When did she tell you?
Tonight, before we all got on.
She was so excited to tell you.
She was just waiting
for the right time.
With everything just,
she wanted to wait till
after your birthday.
Didn't want you to stress out.
So she was...
And I was gonna be a...
And now she's...
What am I gonna do?
I'm turning on to Gower.
We're gonna do whatever
we need to, okay?
What was that?
- This is the police.
- Oh shit.
Officer, I'm
the one who called.
We received a call
about possible domestic abuse.
We need to talk to you.
Open the door.
House is quiet, we cannot enter.
I heard
them fighting earlier.
I think she might be in trouble.
What the fuck am I gonna do?
Mr. Barnes,
open the door.
I've had a bad feeling
about him killing his wife.
Listen, you
know how this works
since you were on the force.
Leave the unit here for an hour
to keep an eye on the place.
We cannot push our
way into a dark house
in the middle of the
night without a warrant.
Mr. Barnes, this is the LAPD.
Please open the door.
I don't know how this happened.
I'm so sorry.
Fuck.
Where's he gonna go?
Where can he go?
Try his cell.
Hold on.
- Hello, you've reached Evan...
- No, nothing.
Try again.
Hello, you've reached Evan,
please leave a message.
Evan, where are you going?
Listen, please just
stay put, okay?
Ollie is not too far behind you.
We can help you.
Come on, Jen.
All right, look, we need to
figure out what to do.
Yeah, no shit.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay, we're on
video doing drugs.
Jen is dead and we
watched Evan kill her.
That was an accident.
Okay, but it doesn't matter.
We're all a part of this now.
If anyone sees this,
we are screwed.
Baby, how is anyone
gonna see us?
We're in a private video chat.
Private? Are you kidding me?
Either way, Evan isn't some
crazy killer, he's terrified.
No, it doesn't matter, okay?
Imagine if someone like a
cop were to walk in there.
Has Evan been like this before?
- Like what?
- Like angry or violent? Anything?
No way.
I mean, there was all that
stuff after his mom died.
What stuff?
He got into a fight in college,
and then he went to
therapy after that.
He just went through some
stuff a long time ago.
Well, I mean it
was more than once
and that one guy did
end up in the hospital.
It was his mom,
she was his only family.
That would mess anyone up.
Hold on, I'm pulling
onto his street.
I mean, he has to
be nearby still.
Christ, there's cops everywhere
still all over his house.
Where are you, Evan?
You guys, do we need
to call a lawyer?
Ben is a lawyer.
- What?
- What do we do?
Well, I'm a patent lawyer.
So what? You must know somebody.
Somebody in your
practice, something.
I cannot tell them that
I was a part of this,
let them know that
I was doing drugs
and that I saw
someone get killed.
- I'm gonna lose my job.
- All right, all right.
Ben, you must know
some other lawyer.
Oh, I must? I must know someone?
Do any of you know
any fucking lawyers?
Don't tell me to calm down.
I can't even think.
I can't, I'm shaking.
Yeah, this doesn't
feel right, Ollie.
Come on, man.
I feel like I'm on shit tons
of Adderall or whatever.
She's right, man, she's right.
There's something else in this.
This just can't just be molly.
Are you kidding me?
Ollie, tell me I'm wrong, dude.
No, no. I trust this guy,
he's my go to.
Okay, well, when you went to
this trustworthy go to guy,
what did you ask for?
I asked for molly.
I said it's my buddy's birthday,
I need something off the hook.
Something off the fucking hook?
Something from a
fucking lab in Japan?
Yes, it's better
over there, okay?
Maybe it's just something else,
like something stronger
or heavier, you know?
Like an amphetamine
or something?
Like meth?
I feel like I'm gonna crawl
out of my fucking skin.
Where are you, Evan?
Fuck, I can't take
another round of this.
- We have to call the police.
- No, no.
We have to figure out
how to help him
before we get the
police involved.
The police are already there.
Okay, are you guys
fucking out of your mind?
He killed Jen and we don't
even know where he is.
- I'm calling.
- No, no, no, no.
Don't, please, please.
Listen to me,
I don't expect you to understand
that Evan is family to me.
Please.
So I'm not?
Of course you are.
No. You know what?
I am gonna go lay down.
You have five minutes to
talk with your family,
I'm calling either way.
All right guys, it's just us.
What do we do?
Ben's right. This shit is
way too big for us now.
- What?
- You know, with everything, the fucking lockdown
and everything's
closing and reopening
and so many people are
dying every single day,
and there should be a light
at the end of the tunnel,
but there is no light at the
end of the tunnel at this point.
No, stop. Don't do that, Harper.
Do what?
Don't do what you always do.
Shit gets hard and you bail?
Fuck, if I wanted to bail,
I would have left when our
friend broke her fucking neck.
Liam, she's dead.
Look at her, okay?
There's nothing we can do
from this side of the screen.
We have to call the cops,
we have to tell them
exactly what happened,
we have to tell them
everything. Ben's right.
Finally one of you guys is
making sense,.I am calling.
Evan?
My God, looked like they were
gonna break your door down.
Hey, baby, he's alive.
- What?
- Come here.
What are you doing?
I don't think they followed me.
Where are you?
I'm on your street.
- What?
- I'm right down the street.
I'm by that school off Franklin.
On my way.
I'll meet you at the corner.
What happened there?
- What?
- Your hand.
I... jumped the fence,
I guess I didn't see
the points at the top.
I had to loop all the
way up around the hill
by the convenience store.
This is not gonna be okay.
So what are you gonna do?
I'm trying to find my car.
Oh my God, fuck!
Shit, we're losing Evan.
Hey, Evan.
I'm so fucking
over these streams.
Evan?
What are you doing?
If he still isn't in
this neighborhood.
It looks
like he's on Argyle.
Ollie, don't you
think people can find him?
Where he can go.
Where can he go?
Evan, get
out of the street.
So many of them up there,
all the time.
Did they find him?
There's cops everywhere.
Evan?
Where are you going?
I'm on the other
side of the school,
over by Cherimoya.
I know
exactly where you are.
Meet me on the street
by those tennis courts.
Oh shit.
- What was that?
- It's a cop.
What's up, officer?
Oh my God.
Quiet.
Right, I'm sorry,
I'll go home.
Forget those guys.
Every time they pull up...
You must be close
to your apartment now.
- He's lost.
- No, he isn't.
Guys, he's almost there.
Fuck, they're everywhere.
Be careful.
What do you
think he's doing?
He just needs
to find his car.
Then what?
What do you
mean then what?
He needs to go somewhere safe.
When you get
to Oliver's place,
figure out what to do.
Like that
will solve anything.
Can you drop it?
At least until he
gets to Oliver?
You know what they'll
do if they catch me.
There's a checkpoint up ahead.
Can you turn off?
There's a cop
headed right for me.
Fuck.
Holy shit, he went right by me.
Maybe I can go around.
Evan, are you
gonna make it to your car?
He looks so freaked out.
He is freaked out,
he's fucking lost.
I don't know where it's at.
I think I parked it down here.
I don't think I'm
gonna make it to you, bro.
There are cops everywhere.
There it is.
Oh my God,
watch out, Evans.
Hey, stay the
fuck away from here, man.
If not for you...
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on, get out of here.
You little piece of shit,
who the fuck do
you think you are?
Get away.
Get away.
Oh my God,
that's fucking frightening.
Jesus! Fuck!
What is he doing?
- Is he gone?
- He's just staring at me.
Oh, thank God I parked
all the way over here.
Evan, what are you gonna do?
Maybe we can meet
somewhere close.
Maybe you can just like
sit in your car for a minute
and chill until
things calm down.
You know, like lay low.
Can you all just
give me a second?
I need to come down
off whatever we took.
In Atlanta today,
after months of construction,
a wall was completed.
There are checkpoints
everywhere,
but I bet you can
make it to my place.
Holy shit, there's lights
in the next street over.
Get out of there, man.
I'm coming to your place.
I'll meet you there.
Holy shit, it's got
terrible out here.
My God, look at all that.
It's gotten so much worse.
My God.
You should see downtown.
The 101 is up ahead.
Is that a good idea?
How else am I going
to get over to Ollie's?
There are cops
everywhere on the side streets.
Here we go. Jesus.
Do you
see any other cars?
Not yet.
Get off as
soon as you can.
I will.
Take the Sunset exit,
- it was clear yesterday.
- Yeah.
I haven't been out in weeks.
They're so clear.
How far are you
from Oliver's now?
Like five minutes.
There's no one on the road.
Which I guess
is good and bad.
You need to get off the highway.
There's a helicopter
right above me
with its spotlight circling.
Fuck, oh God. Oh no.
Well, where are you?
- Where's this happening?
- Molina.
Show us what you see.
Here.
I'm almost home.
There it is,
I'm getting off the highway.
Good, go past Sunset on
Bronson, but be careful.
I think there's still a
military roadblock there.
I know, I got it.
Hey, how far are
you from Oliver's?
- I'm getting close.
- Okay.
How could I do it?
I can't believe I did that.
Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- Shut up for a second.
Holy shit, holy shit.
Jesus...
That was too fucking close.
They aren't following me.
Oliver, you're breaking up.
Hey, how close are you?
- I'm right around the corner.
- Park in front.
You're already back,
what happened?
Yeah, Evan is coming over here.
- What?
- Where else is he gonna go, Mia?
You saw what happened.
It was an accident,
he's not a violent guy.
This is my best friend.
We can't have him here.
Evan is not like Danny.
You promised you
would keep me safe
and that I would never end up
in a situation like that again,
and now your friend
who killed someone...
He didn't kill anybody.
Well, his girlfriend is dead
after being in a fight with him.
Nobody knows what happened.
He can't be in this house.
I shouldn't have to
explain that to you.
Baby, you have to trust me.
Mia, please, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you, Mia.
Please.
Evan, did you make it?
Talk to us.
What are you doing?
What was that?
That's the gate.
He's already here.
It's gonna be okay.
Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I promise you.
Oh shit.
It's gonna be fine.
Hey, hey go to the garage,
okay? It's by the roll-up.
All right.
What are you doing?
I'm giving him the car.
What?
I'm not going anywhere.
What are you doing?
I'm going to try and see.
Where did Oliver go?
Are the police
outside your place?
There's at least one
police car out front.
He's gonna meet
Evan in the garage.
Mia, what do you see?
Hold on, here.
- Is that Evan's car?
- Yeah, that's his.
Oh shit.
Are you all seeing this?
- That's a fucking police car.
- Yeah I know.
Fuck.
Where the hell is he, Mia?
I don't know, but the
police are all over your car.
God damn it.
Evan, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, what should I do?
Where the fuck is Ollie?
Hey, Ev.
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
What happened tonight?
We're gonna figure that out.
I didn't do... I promise you.
You know I didn't do
anything like that.
I know, I see that, I know.
You're okay.
You're okay.
It was an accident, all right?
It was an accident.
Listen, we're gonna
figure all that out.
We need to go, you need
to get out of here.
Hey listen, listen to me.
Come on, come on, get up.
Come on, take the car, okay?
- Take the car.
- Okay, where do I go?
I don't know,
you gotta get out of here.
Just go, go to Griffith Park,
turn off by the...
by the tennis courts.
Remember those old trees?
- Yeah.
- Go there.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Okay, I can do that.
There at the front door.
Oliver.
Holy shit, I'm so sorry, bro.
- I shouldn't have come here.
- Hey, don't say sorry.
Don't say sorry.
Just... We're gonna
get through it, go.
All right?
I think I just saw
someone coming here.
Holy shit, that was close.
His garage door
opener is on the visor.
Hit the second button
and it will open the back gate.
Jesus.
Get out of there, Evan,
come on, man.
LAPD, open up.
- Where the fuck is Oliver?
- One second!
He's on his way up.
All right.
Hello, officer.
The vehicle outside
is owned by a suspect
we are looking for.
Name is Evan Barns.
He has a known connection
to this household.
I know him, but I haven't
seen him in a while.
Is this the residence
of Oliver Harris?
Yeah, it is.
I live here too, but
he's not here right now.
He's taking food
to a sick friend,
and I don't know
when he'll be back.
I'm sure he's gonna stay
at the guy's guest house
cause it's past curfew
and everything.
Things have gotten a lot
worse out here at night.
And so have the penalties
for breaking curfew.
Of course.
Under Los Angeles
City Code 6A,
I'm conducting a lawful
search of this household.
Please put on a mask, ma'am.
- You're alone.
- I am.
Status?
Resident is complying.
Living room is down that way
and bedrooms are upstairs.
No sign
of him down here.
Copy that.
Loud and clear.
You need to move that to
street level... dark in here.
I was about to go to bed.
Officer 17921
checking premises.
First level is clear.
If you want,
I can call my boyfriend.
Please stay where you are.
This won't take long.
Kitchen and living room
are clear.
Heading upstairs.
Waiting at vehicle.
I can barely breathe.
Where the hell is Oliver?
Shh, calm down.
- He won't find anything.
- Will he?
- I don't know, I don't know.
- More drugs?
Anything?
I don't think he could keep
that stuff here. I don't know.
House is clear,
no sign of suspect.
Thank you for your compliance.
I'm happy to help.
What are you gonna do
if you find him?
You know the penalty
for breaking curfew.
He'll be taken to the local
detention center and dealt with.
- What did he do?
- Why are you looking?
Just contact the police
immediately if you see him.
- Of course.
- It's not safe for anyone out here.
What the fuck, Ollie?
Sorry I heard the officer,
I didn't think...
I don't understand. How did they
even know where you were, Evan?
I don't know.
I was the only car out there.
I mean, you know how it is now.
- I handled it.
- What'd you say?
You promised to have my back,
I promise to have yours.
Thank you.
Are you two okay?
Yeah.
Where are you?
I'm over off Silver Lake
headed towards Griffith.
Oh shit.
There's a cop headed
straight for me.
Drive slow.
No, drive normal.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Do I turn off?
- Yes.
- No.
- No.
- No, no, no, don't turn off,
he's gonna follow you
if you turn off.
Just keep driving.
You guys are not helping.
Oh shit, he just turned around
and started following me.
- No.
- Okay, all right, listen.
Hey, stay calm, okay?
And just drive slow.
Evan, if you turn yourself in,
we can find help.
Babe he needs a lawyer,
and we...
Shh.
You know who I should call.
No.
Danny is the best
criminal lawyer. I need to...
Absolutely not.
What?
- Why?
- Who is that?
- I hate the guy.
- Okay, well personal feelings
don't really matter
right now. Okay, Ollie?
Please Mia, please.
You have no idea.
This guy was terrible to her.
All right, then.
No, someone else.
Oliver, we're out of time.
Danny deals with this stuff.
He specializes in it.
He's a big-time trial lawyer.
What else are we gonna do?
- I should call him.
- Yes, she is right.
- You should call him.
- This has gotten so out of hand.
I should have
called him before.
Okay, okay.
I'm right here with you.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Danny.
I know, I know,
and I'm sorry, it's late.
Look, okay, can you just
stop for one second
and listen to me?
Look, our friend is in trouble.
The police were just here,
and I really need your help.
Hey, Ollie,
what happened with them?
This is the guy
she was stuck with
at the beginning of all this.
Okay.
The fact that she would
even call him for us.
I don't know what to say.
Okay, Evan, Evan, go to the
Hollywood police station.
358 North Wilcox,
Danny will meet you there.
Okay, I know where that is.
And park down the street,
and do not go in without him.
And if anybody sees you,
tell them
that your lawyer is on the way.
Mia, thank you.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I know if he tried anything
I got you.
Oh fuck.
Oh God, Mia he's
not gonna make it.
I'm freaking out
'cause I'm on drugs.
- No, calm down.
- And I'm out here past curfew.
No, calm down, calm down.
- He doesn't know any of that.
- Just don't say anything, Evan.
Don't say shit.
Pull the
vehicle over immediately.
Nobody's gonna believe.
You already
violated the curfew,
pull over and turn
the vehicle off.
What should I do?
Should I, should, should I,
should I pull over
or should I just
drive to the station?
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, okay?
Right now just
don't say anything.
Fuck.
What should I do?
Right now,
just don't say anything.
That's all you can do.
Don't say anything.
Evan, what's happening?
Nothing.
He hasn't gotten
out of his car yet.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Evan, I'm not kidding,
whatever you do,
don't say anything to them.
- Maybe I should.
- Stay in your vehicle.
I'm gonna tell him
what happened.
I'm gonna call Danny. Tell me
exactly where you are, Evan.
I don't know,
Sunset and something.
Danny, they pulled him over.
I don't know.
I'm gonna tell him what happened.
I can't just sit here.
No, no, don't say a word.
- Don't do that.
- Stay in your car.
- Do not get out of the car.
- Get back in your car
and put your hands on
the steering wheel.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Get back
in the vehicle.
Just listen to me, please.
No, no, I don't give a shit.
Hands on the steering wheel.
- Back in the vehicle now.
- Just calm down.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Back in the vehicle,
hands on the fucking
steering wheel.
Just, just listen to me.
You don't understand,
- it was an accident, okay?
- Fuck.
I was on my way to the
station to turn myself in.
Suspect has
fresh blood on his hands.
Here.
Hands where
I can see them.
They were all watching,
I didn't mean to kill her.
Get back.
Suspect is down.
Holy fucking shit.
Evan.
Oh my God, Danny,
he got out of the car
and the cop shot him.
I don't know.
Copy that,
back-up is en route.
Will wait till approach.
Fucking do something, help him.
We are watching on chat,
it doesn't record.
I don't think.
Oh fuck, this can get
traced back to us.
Guys we have to log off,
we have to log off right now.
- Everyone has to log off.
- No.
Hello? Do you hear us?
He's gonna die.
Oh, what happened?
Oh my God.
Oliver.
- Babe, what is going on?
- Oliver.
Jane, Jane, how can you?
- How is this?
- Oh my God.
- Are you okay?
- Oh my God, we were sure you were...
We thought you were dead?
What?
What happened?
Where's Evan, my head.
Are you okay?
There's blood everywhere.
I don't...
I don't remember what...
Suspect...
Suspected in
breaking the curfew.
...reaching for a weapon.
Jane.
What the fuck?
Hey, what happened?
What happened?
It's impossible,

Where are you?
You're alive.
Evan, oh my God, oh my God.
How are you alive?
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.
I just woke up.
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Hey, hey, hey, help him, please.
Hey, why aren't you helping him?
Help him.
I'm so excited to
be with you again.
To have a family with you,
to do all things we talked about.
We're gonna have all that, okay?
I promise.
There is so much I wanted to
tell you, I was so excited.
But I waited, it just...
You're gonna be
such a great mom.
No stop, stop, okay?
You are gonna be
an amazing father.
- I love you.
- No, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, help him.
Hey, why aren't you helping him?
Come on.
Back up units
and forensic investigators
arriving on the scene now.
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
What the fuck.
How could you do that?
How could you just let him die?
Suspect appears to have been on
some sort of video chat app.
- I count six viewers.
- Shit.
How can you do this?
This is your NPR news recap...
We are 62 days into the
lockdown for COVID-22 C,
the fourth major outbreak of the novel
coronavirus in just over two years.
The disease
took almost 2 million
more lives today,
bringing the pandemic
death toll to 253 million.
While the first COVID outbreak,
which began in early 2020,
may have lasted the longest,
the subsequent strains of the
virus have been far more deadly.
The United States
to offer assistance to UK,
where a split Parliament
has started the
official division
into two sovereign states...
This is the seventh major
superpower to fall in 2020.
Today in Jakarta, 562 people...
Evan.
Oh my God.
It's going to disappear
one day.
It's like a miracle,
it will disappear.
And from our shores,
it could get worse
before it gets better.
Maybe go away.
We'll see what happens.
Nobody really knows.
Because of all we've done,
the risk to the American people
remains very low.
Those, of course, clips
from some of the first
coronavirus task force briefings,
all the way back at
the beginning of 2020.
In response to early
breakthroughs in the application
of successful vaccines
and life-saving treatments,
political officials
are declaring
that the COVID-19 pandemic
is over.
Today, President Trump
announced the full reopening
of the United States.
It's a great day for everybody.
This is a great day
for everybody.
This is a great, great day.
Open it up.
Much has changed,
but we can all breathe
a sigh of relief
that the worst is over.
- Oh my God.
- It's over, baby. Cheers!
It's over.
Can you guys believe
it's actually over?
- Oh thank God.
- Yes.
It's over.
Okay, I just have to say
was it just me or was that
the longest six months?
- Ever.
- Ever.
- Ever.
- In history.
And no more
group video chats.
- What?
- I liked them.
Oh, Evan,
your birthday's coming up.
It is.
Oh, hey and we can
all travel soon, so...
You know what else we can do?
We can go to Vegas.
Yes.
I like that idea.
Guys, I hate Vegas.
Ah please, don't listen to her.
Come on.
You know what?
I had one thing I would like to say...
Yes.
...friends, and that is
can I get a "fuck corona"?
Oh, you wanna "fuck corona"?
All right.
- Fuck corona.
- Fuck corona!
- Fuck corona!
- Fuck it.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Over.
COVID-19.
- Cheers, babe.
- Cheers, baby.
