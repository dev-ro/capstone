Julian "Dice" Black,
The New York City DJ...
who discovered music sensation
Billie Frank...
Was found dead in Lower Manhattan
earlier this evening.
[ASTONISHED GROANS]
Dice, as he was known
in music circles,
was the victim of
a gunshot wound to the chest.
Police are ruling his death
a homicide,
and at present, no suspects
have been apprehended.
I'm Tanya Kim for NYC News.
Let's hope she wasn't with him.
[TV CLICKS OFF]
Oh, Billie, I'm so sorry.
