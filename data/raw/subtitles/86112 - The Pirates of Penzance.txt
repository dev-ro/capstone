Shoo, shoo.
Pirates!
What? No! No!
I'll get you for this.
Not in the water! No!
Happy birthday!
Pour, oh pour,
the pirate sherry
Fill, oh fill,
the pirate glass
And to make us
more than merry,
let the pirate bumper pass!
For today our pirate friend,
he rises from indentures freed
Strong his arm
and keen his scent is
He's a pirate now, indeed
Here's good luck
to Frederic's ventures
Frederic's out
of his indentures
Happy
21st birthday!
One and 20
now he's rising
And alone
he's fit to fly
Which we're bent on
signalizing with
unusual revelry
Here's good luck
to Frederic's ventures
Frederic's out
of his indentures
Pour, oh pour,
the pirate sherry
Fill, oh fill,
the pirate glass
And to make us
more than merry
Let the pirate bumper pass
Yes, Frederic.
From today, you'll rank
as a full-blown member
of our band.
My friends, I thank
you all from my heart
for your kind wishes.
Would that
I could repay them
as they deserve.
What do you mean?
Today, I am out
of my indentures.
Today...
I leave you forever.
Hey.
What?
This is quite
unaccountable.
A keener hand
at scuttling a Cunarder
or cutting a P&O
never shipped
a handspike!
Yes, I did
my best for you.
And why?
Because it was my duty
under my indentures.
And I am
the slave of duty.
Oh.
As a child,
I was regularly
apprenticed to your band.
It was through
an error.
An error?
No matter.
The mistake was ours,
not yours, and I was
in honor bound by it.
What error?
Well, I dare not say,
for it would reflect
upon my well-loved Ruth.
Ruth?
Nay, dear master,
my mind has long been
gnawed by the cankering
tooth of mystery.
Better have it
out at once.
When Frederic
was a little lad
He proved
so brave and daring
His father thought
he'd 'prentice him
to some career seafaring
I was, alas,
his nursery maid
And so it fell
to my lot
To take and bind
the promising boy
Apprentice to a pilot
A ship's pilot?
A life not bad
for a hardy lad
Though surely
not a high lot
Though I'm a nurse
You might do worse
than make your boy
a pilot
I was a stupid
nursery maid
On breakers
always steering
And I did not catch
the word aright
Through being
hard of hearing
Mistaking my instructions
which within my brain
did gyrate
I took and bound
this promising boy
Apprentice to a pirate
A sad mistake
it was to make
And doom him
to this vile lot
I bound him
to a pirate, you
Instead of to a pilot
This afternoon
my obligation ceases.
Aye.
Individually, I love you all
with affection unspeakable.
But collectively,
I look upon you
with a disgust
that amounts to
absolute detestation.
Oh, pity me,
beloved friends.
For such is my
sense of duty,
that once out
of my indentures,
I shall feel
myself bound
to devote myself
heart and soul
to your extermination.
No, no, no,
no, Frederic.
If you
conscientiously feel
that it is your duty
to destroy us,
we cannot blame you
for acting on
that conviction.
Always act
in accordance
with the dictates
of your conscience,
my boy,
and chance
the consequences!
And besides,
we can offer you
but little temptation
to remain with us.
We don't seem able
to make piracy pay.
I don't know
why I'm sure,
but I don't.
Well, I do know why.
Alas, I cannot tell you!
It would not be right.
Why not?
It's only...
11:56.
And you are one of us
until the clock
strikes 12.
Aye!
And until then,
you are bound to
protect our interests.
Hear, hear.
Well, then, it's my duty
as a pirate to tell you
that you are too
tender-hearted.
For instance,
you make it a point
of never attacking
a weaker party
than yourselves.
And when you attack
a stronger one,
you invariably
get thrashed!
There's some
truth in that.
And then again,
you make it a point of
never molesting an orphan.
Well, of course not!
We're orphans ourselves!
And know what it is like!
Yes, but it has got about.
And what is the consequence?
Everyone we capture
says he's an orphan!
The last three ships we took
proved to be manned
entirely by orphans.
One would think
that Great Britain's
mercantile fleet
was recruited
solely from her
orphan asylums.
And we know
this is not the case.
Frederic, you wouldn't
have us absolutely
merciless?
Ah, well,
there's my problem.
Till 12:00, I would,
after 12:00, I wouldn't.
Oh, was ever a man placed
in so delicate a situation.
Frederic.
Frederic.
Frederic.
And, Ruth, your own Ruth
whom you love so well,
who has won
her middle-aged way
into your boyish heart.
What is to become of her?
Oh, he will take you
with him.
Well, Ruth.
I feel some little
difficulty about you.
It's true
I admire you
very much.
But I've been
constantly at sea
since I was eight years old.
Yours is the only
woman's face I've
seen in that time.
I think it is
a sweet face.
Ah, it is.
Oh, it is.
I say,
I think it is.
But as I've never
had the opportunity
of comparing you
with other women,
I just
may be mistaken.
True.
Excuse me.
What a terrible thing
it would be
if I were to marry
this innocent person,
to find out that she is,
on the whole...
...plain.
Plain? Oh, Ruth?
Ruth is very...
Well...
Well?
Yes. Very well.
There are the remains
of a fine woman about Ruth.
Do you really
think so?
I do.
Well then,
I will not be
so selfish
as to take
her from you.
In justice to her,
and in consideration
for you, sir,
I will
leave her behind.
Oh.
Ah.
Oh.
Oh, no. No.
No!
No, Fredric. No, no.
No, this must not be.
No, no! We are rough men!
Rough!
Who lead
a rough life.
Rough! Rough!
But we are not
so utterly heartless
as to deprive thee
of thy love!
I think I'm right
in saying that
there is not one here
who would rob thee
of this inestimable treasure
for all the world holds dear.
Not one!
I thought there wasn't.
Well, it's the top
of the tide and
we must be off ourselves.
There's the day's
pillage to be done.
Man the foresail.
Jib the top fold.
Hoist the topsail.
Hoist the mainsail.
Hoist the jibsail.
Drop the anchor.
Weigh the anchor.
Hoist the topsail.
Frederic! Don't swim.
Take the dinghy.
And when your process
of extermination begins,
let our deaths be
as swift and painless
as you can conveniently
make them.
I will.
By the love
I have for you,
I swear it!
Oh, would that
you could render this
extermination unnecessary,
by accompanying me
back to civilization.
No, Frederic,
it cannot be.
I don't think much
of our profession.
But contrasted
with respectability,
it is comparatively
honest.
No, Frederic.
I shall live
and die
a Pirate King!
Oh, better far
to live and die
Under the brave
black flag I fly
Than play
a sanctimonious part
With a pirate head
and a pirate heart
Away to the cheating world
go you
Where pirates all
are well-to-do
But I'll be true
to the song I sing
And live and die
A Pirate King
For I am a Pirate King
And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King
But I am a Pirate King
You are!
Hurrah for the Pirate King
And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King
It is!
Hurrah for the Pirate King
Hurrah for the Pirate
King
He is a Pirate King,
he is
Hurrah for the Pirate King
And it is,
it is a glorious thing
To be a Pirate King, it is
Hurrah for the Pirate King,
hurrah for the Pirate King
When I sally forth
to seek my prey
I help myself
in a royal way
I sink a few more ships,
it's true
Than a well-bred monarch
ought to do
But many a king
on a first-class throne
If he wants to call
his crown his own
Must manage somehow
to get through
More dirty work
Than ever I do
For
I am a Pirate King
And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King
I am a Pirate King
You are,
you are a Pirate King
And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King, it is
Hurrah for the Pirate King
Hurrah for the Pira...
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ho
...rate King
Now watch it.
Watch it carefully.
That's it. That's it.
Now take my hand.
Be careful,
don't rock
the boat now.
Oh!
Ruth.
Oh!
Tell me candidly,
and without reserve.
Compared with
other women,
how are you?
I will tell you
truthfully.
I have a slight cold,
but otherwise
I'm quite well.
Well, I am sorry
for your cold,
but I was referring
rather to your
personal appearance.
Compared with
other women, are you...
You know...
Beautiful?
I have been told so,
dear master.
Oh, but lately?
No. Years
and years ago.
Well, what do you
think of yourself?
It is a delicate
question.
But I think
I am a fine woman.
Thank you, Ruth,
I believe you.
For I know
you would not practice
upon my inexperience.
I wish to do
the right thing.
And if you are truly
a fine woman,
well, then, your age
shall be no obstacle
to our union!
Hark!
Surely, I hear voices!
Who has ventured
to approach our all
but inaccessible lair?
Can it be
the Coast Guard?
Oh, yes,
it's the Coast Guard.
No, it does not sound
like the Coast Guard.
By all that's marvelous,
a bevy of beautiful
young maidens!
Oh, it's lost,
lost, lost.
How lovely!
How surpassingly lovely
is the plainest of them.
What grace,
what delicacy.
What refinement!
Oh, false one,
you have deceived me
I have deceived you?
Yes! Deceived me
You told me
you were fair as gold
And, master,
am I not so
And now I see
you're plain and old
I'm sure
I'm not a jot so
Upon my innocence
you play
I'm not the one
to plot so
Your face is lined,
your hair is gray
It's gradually
got so
Faithless woman
to deceive me
I who trusted so
Master, master,
do not leave me
Hear me 'ere you go
Faithless woman
Master, master
Faithless woman
Master, master
Faithless woman
Do not leave me
To deceive me
Do not leave me
I who trusted so
Hear me 'ere you go
Faithless woman to deceive me
Master, master,
do not leave me
I who trusted so
Hear me 'ere you go
Ow!
My love
without reflecting
Oh, do not be rejecting
Take a maiden tender
Her affection
raw and green
At very highest rating
Has been accumulating
Summer's 17
Summer's 17
Don't, beloved master
Crush me with disaster
What is such a dower
To the dower
I have here
Yes, your former master
Don't, beloved master
Save you from disaster
Crush me with disaster
Your love would be
What is such a dower
Uncomfortably fervid,
it is clear
To the dower I have here?
My love unabating
If, as you are stating
Has been accumulating
Forty-seven years
Forty-seven years!
Forty-seven years
Faithless woman
to deceive me
I who trusted so
Faithless woman
to deceive me
Master, master,
do not leave me
I who trusted
Hear me 'ere you
So!
Go!
Climbing over rocky mountain
Skipping rivulet
and fountain
Passing where
the willows quiver
By the ever rolling river
Swollen with
the summer rain,
the summer rain
Threading long
and leafy mazes
Dotted with
unnumbered daisies
Dotted, dotted with
unnumbered daisies
Scaling rough
and rugged passes
Climb the hardy
little lassies
Till the bright seashore
they gain
Scaling rough
and rugged passes
Climb the hardy
little lassies
Till the bright seashore
they gain
Let us gaily
tread the measure
Make the most
of fleeting leisure
Hail it as a true ally
Though it perish
by-and-by
Hail it as a true ally
Though it perish
by-and-by
Every moment
brings a treasure
Of its own especial pleasure
Though the moments
quickly die
Greet them gaily
as they fly
Greet them gaily
As they fly
Though the moments
quickly die
Greet them gaily
as they fly
Let us gaily
tread the measure
Make the most
of fleeting leisure
Hail it as a true ally
Though it perish
by-and-by
Hail it as a true ally
Though it perish
by-and-by
Let us gaily
tread the measure
Make the most
of fleeting leisure
Hail it as a true ally
A true ally!
We're quite alone.
Suppose we
take off our shoes.
And our stockings
and paddle.
Paddle?
In all probability
we are the
first human beings
who ever set foot
on this enchanting spot.
Except for
the mermaids, it's the
very place for mermaids.
Who are only
human beings
down to the waist.
And who can't be said
strictly to set foot anywhere.
I'm going to
take off my stocking.
Stop, ladies, pray
A man!
I had intended
not to intrude myself
upon your notice
In this effective
but alarming costume
But under these
peculiar circumstances
I feel it is my bounden duty
to inform you
That your proceedings here
will not be unwitnessed
But who are you, sir?
Speak!
I am a pirate
A pirate! Horror!
Ladies, do not shun me
This evening I renounce
my vile profession
And, to that end,
o pure
and peerless maidens
Oh, blushing buds
of ever-blooming beauty
I, sore at heart,
I, sore at heart
Implore your kind assistance
How pitiful his tale
How rare his beauty
How pitiful his tale
How rare
His beauty
Oh, is there not
one maiden breast
Which does not feel
the moral beauty
Of making worldly interest
Subordinate
to sense of duty?
Who would not
give up willingly
All matrimonial ambition
To rescue such a one as I
From his unfortunate
Position?
From his
Position
Oh, is there not
one maiden here
Whose homely face
and bad complexion
Have caused
all hope to disappear
Of ever winning
man's affection?
To such a one,
if such there be
I swear by heaven's arch
above you
If you will cast
your eyes on me
However plain you be
I'll love you
However plain you be
If you will
cast your eyes on me
However plain you be
I'll love
You!
I'll love you
I'll love
You
Alas!
There's not one maiden here
Whose homely face
and bad complexion
Have caused
all hope to disappear
Of ever winning man's
Affection!
Not one?
No, no, not one
Not one?
No, no!
Yes, one!
Oh, Mabel!
'Tis Mabel
Yes, 'tis
Mabel
Oh, Sisters,
deaf to pity's name
for shame!
It's true that
he has gone astray
but pray
Is that a reason
good and true
why you
Should all be deaf
to pity's name?
The question is
had he not been
a thing of beauty
Would she be swayed
by quite as keen
a sense of duty?
For shame
For shame
Poor wandering one
Though thou
hast surely strayed
Take heart of grace,
thy steps retrace
Poor wandering one
Poor wandering one
If such poor love as mine
Can help thee find
true peace of mind
Why, take it
It is thine
Take heart,
no danger low'rs
Take any heart
but ours
Take heart,
fair days will shine
Take any heart,
take mine
Thank you.
Take heart,

In. Out. Stop dinghy.
Maidens!
Maidens!
Quietly, men, down.
Men!
What?
Quiet!
Come on.
Stay down.
First-rate opportunity.
Now, to the port.
You to the starboard.
No. I mean, the starboard.
You to the port.
Stay, we must not
lose our senses
Men who stick
at no offences
Will anon be here
Piracy their dreadful trade is
Pray you get you,
hence, young ladies
While the coast is clear
No, we must not
lose our senses
If they stick
at no offences
We should not be here
Piracy
their dreadful trade is
Nice companions
for young ladies
Let us...
Each man to a woman.
Man your women.
Too late
Hello. Mmm.
Here's a first-rate
opportunity
To get married with impunity
And indulge in the felicity
of unbounded domesticity
You shall
quickly be parsonified
Conjugally matrimonified
By a doctor of divinity
who is located
in this vicinity
We have missed
our opportunity
Of escaping with impunity
So farewell to the felicity
of our maiden domesticity
We shall
quickly be parsonified
Conjugally matrimonified
By a doctor of divinity
who is located
in this vicinity
By a doctor of divinity,
who resides in this vicinity
By a doctor, a doctor,
a doctor of divinity
Of divinity
Away!
Hold it, you.
Hold, monsters
Ere your pirate
caravanserai
Proceed against our will
to wed us all
Just bear in mind
that we are wards
in Chancery
And father
is a Major-General
We'd better pause,
or danger may befall
Their father
is a Major-General
Yes, yes,
he is a Major-General
Yes, yes,
I am a Major-General
For he is
a Major-General
He is! Hurrah for
the Major-General
And it is,
it is a glorious thing
To be a Major-General
It is!
Hurrah for the Major-General
Hurrah for the Major-General
It's the same as
the Pirate King tune!
I am the very model
of a modern Major-General
I've information vegetable,
animal, and mineral
I know the kings of England,
and I quote
the fights historical
From Marathon to Waterloo,
in order categorical
I'm very well acquainted,
too, with matters
mathematical
I understand equations,
both the simple
and quadratical
About binomial theorem
I'm teeming
with a lot o' news
Lot o' news.
Got it!
With many cheerful facts
about the square
of the hypotenuse
I'm very good at integral
and differential calculus
I know the scientific names
of beings animalculous
In short, in matters
vegetable,
animal, and mineral
I am the very model
of a modern Major-General
In short, in matters
vegetable,

He is the very model

In fact, when I know
what is meant
By "mamelon"
and "ravelin"
When I can tell at sight
A Mauser rifle
from a javelin
When such affairs
as sorties and surprises
I'm more wary at
And when I know precisely
what is meant
by "commissariat"
When I have learnt
what progress has been made
in modern gunnery
When I know more of tactics
than a novice in a nunnery
In short,
when I've a smattering
of elemental strategy
Strategy?
Oh, my word.
That's a hard one,
isn't it?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Cup of tea.
Allergy.
Got it!
You'll say a better
Major-General
has never sat a gee
You'll say a better
Major-General

For my military knowledge,
though I'm plucky
and adventury
Has only been brought down
to the beginning
of the century
But still, in matters
vegetable,

I am the very model
of a modern Major-General
But still, in matters

He is the very model

Encore! Encore!
Can you do it one more time?
Certainly.
And can you do it
really fast?
Watch this!

Enough! He might sing
another encore.
Well, now that
I've introduced myself.
I should like to have
some idea
of what's going on?
Permit me,
I can explain
in two words.
We propose
to marry your daughters.
Against our wills, Papa.
Against our wills.
Oh, you mustn't
do that!
Ooh! May I ask.
This is a picturesque uniform.
I'm not familiar with it.
What are you?
We are all
single gentlemen.
I gather that.
Anything else?
No, nothing else.
Don't believe him, Papa.
They're all pirates.
The famous Pirates
of Penzance.
Yes, infamous.
The Pirates of Penzance!
Yes, I've often
heard of them.
All except
for this gentleman,
who was a pirate once,
but is out of
his indentures today
and means to lead
a blameless life
evermore.
Now wait a bit.
I said you wait a bit!
I object to pirates
as sons-in-law.
We object to major-generals
as fathers-in-law.
But we waive
that point.
Oh!
We do not press it.
We look over it.
I have an idea.
And do you mean
to say...
Do you mean to say
you would rob me of these,
the sole remaining props
of my old age?
And leave me to go through
the remainder of my life
unfriended, unprotected
and alone?
Well, yes,
that's the idea.
To them, lads.
One moment.
One moment.
Have you ever known
what it is to be an orphan?
Oh, dash it!
Here we are again!
I ask you
have you ever known
what it is to be an orphan?
Often!
Yes, orphan.
Have you ever known
what it is to be one?
I say, often.
Often, often, often.
To the ship.
Hang on a minute.
I tell you,
hang on a minute.
Now, listen,
I don't think we quite
understand one another.
I ask you have you
ever known what it is
to be an orphan,
and you say "orphan. "
Now as I understand you,
you are merely repeating
the word "orphan"
to show that
you understand me. Hmm.
I didn't repeat
the word "orphan. "
Pardon me,
you did indeed.
I only
repeated it once.
True, but you
repeated it!
But not often!
Ooh! Ooh!
I think I can see
where we are
getting confused.
Now, when you say
"orphan,"
did you mean "orphan,"
a person that has
lost his parents
or "often,"
"frequently"?
Oh!
I beg your pardon.
I see what you mean.
Of course,
you do, yes.
Frequently.
You said
"often" frequently?
No, only once.
Exactly. You said
"often," frequently,
only once.
Seize that man!
Oh, men of dark
and dismal fate
Forgo your cruel employ
Have pity
on my lonely state
I am an orphan boy
An orphan boy?
An orphan boy
How sad
An orphan boy
These children
whom you see
Are all that
I can call me own
Poor fellow
Take them away from me
And I shall
be indeed alone
Poor fellow
See, at our feet
they kneel
Our hearts we cannot steel
Against the sad, sad tale
Of the lonely
Orphan boy
I'm telling a terrible story
but it doesn't
diminish my glory
For they would have
taken my daughters
over the billowy waters
If I hadn't,
in elegant diction
Indulged in
an innocent fiction
Which is not in
the same category as telling
a regular terrible story
He's telling
a terrible story
Which will tend
to diminish his glory
Though they would
have taken his daughters
Over the billowy waters
It is easy,
in elegant diction
To call it
an innocent fiction
But it comes
in the same category
As telling
a regular terrible story
It's easy,
in elegant diction
To call it
an innocent fiction
But it comes in
the same category
As telling a regular story
Although our dark career
Sometimes involves
the crime of stealing
We rather think
that we're
Not altogether
void of feeling
Although
we live by strife
We're always sorry
to begin it
For what, we ask
Is life
Without a touch
Of poetry in it
Hail, poetry
Thou heaven-born maid
Thou gildest even
The pirate's trade
Hail, flowing
Fount of sentiment
All hail
All hail
Divine
Emollient!
You may go,
for you're at liberty
Our pirate rules
protect you
And honorary members
of our band
We do elect you
Thank you.
Hurray!
For he is
an orphan boy
He is!
Hurrah for the orphan boy
And it sometimes
is a useful thing
to be an orphan boy
It is!
Hurrah for the orphan boy
Hurrah for the orphan boy
Oh, happy day,
with joyous glee
They will away
and married be
Oh, happy day,
with joyous glee
They will away
and married be
Should it befall
auspiciously
Our Sisters all
will bridesmaids be
Should it befall
auspiciously
Our Sisters all
will bridesmaids be
Oh, happy day,
with joyous glee
They will away
and married be
Should it befall
auspiciously
Our Sisters all

Should it befall
auspiciously
Our Sisters all

Papa?
Papa?
Papa?
Oh, dry
the glistening tear
That dews
that martial cheek
Thy loving children hear
In them thy comfort seek
With sympathetic care
Their arms around thee creep
For oh, they cannot bear
To see
Their father weep
Oh, Frederic,
cannot you,
in the calm excellence
of your wisdom,
reconcile it
with your conscience
to say something
that will ease
my father's sorrow?
What?
Can't you cheer
him up?
Oh, I would try,
dear Mabel.
But why does he sit here
night after night
in this drafty old ruin?
Why do I sit here?
Oh, Frederic,
Frederic!
In order to escape
the pirates' clutches,
I described myself
as an orphan,
and heaven help me,
I am no orphan.
Well, be comforted, sir.
For had you not
acted as you did,
these reckless men
would most assuredly
have called in
the nearest clergyman
and married
your large family
on the spot.
I thank you for
your proffered solace,
but it is unavailing.
I tell you, Frederic,
such is the anguish
and remorse I feel
at the abominable
falsehood
by which I escaped
these easily deluded
pirates,
that I would go
to their simple-minded
chief this very night
and confess all.
Ah!
But did I not feel
that the consequences
would be oh, oh,
oh, no, oh, no, no,
most disastrous,
most disastrous
to myself.
At what hour
does your expedition march
against these scoundrels?
At 11:00.
And before midnight
I hope to have atoned
for my involuntary
association with
the pestilent scourges
by sweeping them
from the face
of the Earth!
Oh.
And then, dear Mabel,
you will be mine.
Are your devoted
followers at hand?
They are.
They only await
my order.
Then, Frederic
Let your escort
lion-hearted
Be summoned to receive
a General's blessing
Ere they depart
upon their dread adventure
Dear, sir, they come!
When the foeman
bares his steel
Tarantara,
tarantara
Oh, we uncomfortable feel
Tarantara
And we find
the wisest thing
Tarantara,
tarantara
Is to slap our chests
and sing
Tarantara
For when threatened
with emutes
Tarantara,
tarantara
And your heart
is in your boots
Tarantara
There is nothing
brings it round
Like the trumpet's
martial sound
Tarantara,
tarantara
Tarantara, tarantara
Ra-ra-tarantara
Go, ye heroes,
go to glory
Though ye die
in combat gory
Ye shall live
in song and story
Go to immortality
Go to death
and go to slaughter
Die, and every
Cornish daughter
With her tears
your grave shall water
Go, ye heroes,
go and die
Tho' to us
it's evident
Tarantara,
tarantara
These attentions
are well meant
Tarantara
Such expressions
don't appear
Tarantara,
tarantara
Calculated men
to cheer
Tarantara
Who are going
to meet their fate
In a highly
nervous state
Tarantara, tarantara,
tarantara
Still to us
it's evident
These attentions
are well meant
Tarantara,
tarantara,
tarantara
Go and do
your best endeavor
And before all links,
we sever
We will say farewell
forever
Go to glory
and the grave!
Go to glory
and the grave
For your foes are
fierce and ruthless
False, unmerciful
and truthless
Young and tender,
old and toothless
All in vain
their mercy crave
We observe
too great a stress
On the risks
that on us press
And of reference
a lack
To our chance
of coming back
Still perhaps
it would be wise
Not to carp
or criticize
For it's very evident
These attentions
are well meant
Yes, perhaps
it would be wise
Not to carp
or criticize
For it's very evident
These attentions
are well meant
Yes, it's very evident
Wait!
Get back in line.
These attentions
are well meant
Get back! Back!
Evident, yes,
well meant evident!
Ah, yes, well meant!
When the foeman
bares his steel
Go, ye heroes
Tarantara, tarantara
Go to glory
Oh, we uncomfortable feel
Though ye die
Tarantara
In combat gory
And we find the wisest thing
Ye shall
Tarantara, tarantara
Live in song and story
Is to slap our chests and sing
Go to
Tarantara
Immortality
Go to death
For when threatened
with emutes
Tarantara, tarantara
And go to slaughter
And your heart
is in your boots
Die, and every
Tarantara
Cornish daughter
There is nothing
brings it round
With her tears
Like the trumpet's
martial sound
Your grave shall water
Like the trumpet's
martial sound
Go, ye heroes
Tarantara, tarantara
Go and die
Tarantara, tarantara
Go, ye heroes
Tarantara, tarantara
Go to immortality
Tarantara, tarantara
Go, ye heroes
Tarantara, tarantara
Go to immortality
Ra-ra-ra-ra
Go, ye heroes
Ra-ra-ra-ra-tarantara
Go to
Ra-ra-tarantara
Immortality
Away, away
Yes, yes, we go
These pirates slay
Tarantara
Then do not stay
Tarantara
Then why this delay?
All right, we go!
Yes, forward on the foe!
Yes, forward!
Yes, forward on the foe!
On the foe
They're still here!
We go! We go!
They go! They go!
Yes, forward on the foe
Yes, forward
Yes, forward on the foe
On the foe
Mabel,
they're still here!
We go! We go!
At last they go!
We go! We go!
At last they go!
At last they go!
We go! We go! We go! We go!
At last they
really, really go!
Yes,
but you don't go.
We go! We go!
They go! They go!
Yes, forward on the foe
Yes, forward
Damn it,
they don't go.
We go! We go!
At last they go!
We go! We go!
At last they go!
At last they go!
We go! We go! We go!
At last they really, really
We go! We go! We go!
Really, really, really
We go! We go!
Really go!
Now for the pirates' lair!
Oh, joy unbounded!
Oh, sweet relief!
Oh, rapture unexampled!
At last I may atone
in some slight measure
For the repeated acts
of theft and pillage
Of which, at a sense
of duty's stern dictation
I, circumstance's victim
Have been guilty
Young Frederic!
Who calls?
Your late commander
And I,
your little Ruth
Oh, mad intruders
How dare
ye face me?
Know ye not,
oh, rash ones
That I have doomed you
to extermination?
Have mercy on us
Have mercy on us
Get back! Back!
Hear us,
ere you slaughter
I do not think
I ought to listen to you
Yet, mercy should alloy
our stern resentment
And so
I will be merciful
Say on!
Quiet.
When you had left
our pirate fold
We tried to raise
our spirits faint
According to
our custom old
With quips and
quibbles quaint
But all in vain
the quips we heard
We lay and sobbed
upon the rocks
Oh.
Until to somebody
occurred
A startling paradox
A paradox?
A paradox!
A most ingenious
paradox
We've quips
and quibbles
heard in flocks
But none to beat
this paradox!
A paradox, a paradox
A most ingenious paradox
This paradox
Ooh, I love
a good paradox.
The paradox
For some
ridiculous reason
To which, however,
I've no desire
to be disloyal
No.
Some person
in authority
Who?
I don't know who
Very likely
the Astronomer Royal
Has decided that
Although for
such a beastly month
as February
Twenty-eight days
as a rule are plenty
One year in every four
His days shall be reckoned
as nine and twenty
Through some
singular coincidence
I shouldn't be surprised
If it were owing
to the agency
of an ill-natured fairy
You are the victim of
this clumsy arrangement
Having been born
in leap year
On the 29th of February
And so?
And so, by a simple
arithmetical process
You'll easily discover
That though you've
lived 21 years
Yet, if we go
by birthdays
You're only five
and a little bit over
Dear me! Let's see!
Yes, yes, with yours
my figures do agree
Five and a quarter,
oh, that's rich!
How quaint
the ways of paradox
At common sense
she gaily mocks
Though counting
in the usual way
Years 21
I've been alive
Yet, reckoning
by my natal day
Yet, reckoning
by my natal day
One, two, three, four...
I am a little boy of five
He is
a little boy of five
A paradox, a paradox
A most ingenious paradox
The paradox
A curious paradox
A most ingenious paradox!
Upon my word,
this is most curious
indeed.
Most absurdly whimsical.
Five-and-a-quarter, eh?
You wouldn't think it
to look at me.
You'll be glad
I'll be bound,
that you spared us.
You never
would have
forgiven yourself
when you discovered
you killed
your two comrades.
My comrades?
I'm afraid you don't
appreciate the delicacy
of your position.
You were apprenticed
to us.
Yes, until I reached
my 21st year.
Ah! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Until you reached
your 21st...
Oh. Birthday.
And going by birthdays,
you are as yet only
five-and-a-quarter.
You don't mean to
say you are going to
hold me to this?
No, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no.
We merely remind you
of the fact,
and leave the rest
to your sense of duty.
Your sense of duty.
Oh, I abhor
your infamous calling.
I shudder at the thought
that I've ever been
mixed up with it!
But duty is before all!
And at any price
I will do my duty.
Oh, bravely spoken!
Come!
You're one of us
once more.
Lead on, I follow.
Come.
That's the ship.
My eyes are fully opened
to my awful situation
I shall go at once to Mabel
and make her an oration
I will tell her
I am bound by duty
and my moral senses
And I don't know what to do
about the penny consequences
Now I do not want to perish
by the sword or by the dagger
But a pirate must indulge
a little pardonable swagger
And a word or two
of compliment my vanity
would flatter
But I've got to go tonight
so it really doesn't matter!
So it really doesn't matter!
So it really doesn't matter!
So it really
doesn't matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter!
Matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter
If this were not
a little mad
and generally silly
I should give you my advice
upon the subject, willy-nilly
I should show you
in a moment how to
grapple with the question
And you'd really be astonished
at the force of my suggestion
On the subject
I shall write you
a most valuable letter
Full of excellent suggestions
when I feel a little better
But at present I'm afraid
I am as mad as any hatter
So I'll sing this song
for ruddy good
it really doesn't matter
What we sing doesn't matter
What we sing doesn't matter
What we sing
doesn't matter
No, it really
doesn't matter
What we sing doesn't
matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter
Matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter
If I had been so lucky
as to have a steady mother
Who could talk to me
as we are talking now
to one another
Who could give me
good advice when she
discovered I was erring
Which is just the very favor
which on you I am conferring
My existence would have made
a rather interesting idyll
And I might have
lived and died
a very decent indiwiddle
This particularly rapid,
unintelligible patter
Isn't generally heard,
and if it is,
it doesn't matter!
If it is, it doesn't matter
If it is, it doesn't matter
This particularly
rapid, unintelligible patter
Isn't generally heard,
and if it is,
it doesn't matter!
This particularly rapid,
unintelligible patter
Isn't generally heard,
and if it is,
it doesn't matter!
Matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter
Matter, matter, matter!
Oh, horror!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Ought I to tell you?
What?
Oh, no, I cannot.
Yet, as one of
your band...
Speak out, I charge you
by that sense of
conscientiousness
to which we've
never yet appealed
in vain.
General Stanley...
Yes.
The father of my Mabel.
Yes, yes!
General Stanley
escaped from you
on the plea
that he was an orphan.
He did?
Oh. Oh, yes, he did.
I was there.
Well?
Oh!
It breaks my heart
to betray the honored father
of the girl I adore.
Break it.
And yet,
as your apprentice,
I have no alternative.
None.
It is my duty then
to tell you...
Yes, your duty.
...that General Stanley...
Yes?
Well, General Stanley...
General Stanley
is what?
Well, he is no...
He's no...
Well...
What, what, what?
General Stanley is no
orphan!
When you say "orphan,"
you mean, "orphan,"
a person that has
lost his parents
or "often,"
"frequently"?
A person that has
lost his parents.
What?
What?
And more than that...
No.
Oh.
Oh.
He never was one!
Am I to understand
that in order to save
his contemptible life,
he dared to practice
on our credulous
simplicity?
Our revenge
will be swift!
We will go
and collect our band
and attack Tremorden Castle
this very night.
But stay!
Not a word!
He is doomed!
Away, away!
My heart's on fire
I burn, this base
deception to repay
This very night
my vengeance dire
Shall glut itself in gore!
Away, away!
Away, away!
Ere I expire
I find my duty
hard to do today
My heart is filled
with anguish dire
It strikes me to the core!
Away, away!
With falsehood foul
he tricked us
of our brides
Let vengeance howl
the pirate so decides
Our nature stern
he softened with his lies
And, in return,
tonight the traitor dies
Yes, yes!
Tonight the traitor dies!
Tonight he dies
Yes, or early tomorrow
His girls likewise?
They will welter
in sorrow
The one soft spot
In their natures
they cherish
And all who plot
To abuse it
shall perish
Tonight he dies
Yes, or early tomorrow
His girls likewise,
they'll welter in sorrow
The one soft spot
In their natures
they cherish
And all who plot
to abuse it shall perish
Away, away! Away!
Tonight the traitor dies!
Away, away!
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!
The traitor dies tonight!
Away!
Oh.
Stay, Frederic, stay!
Nay, Mabel, nay!
They have no claim
But duty's name
The thought my soul appalls
No shadow of a shame
But when stern duty calls
Will fall upon thy name
Stay, Frederic, stay!
I must obey
Ah, leave me
not to pine
Alone and desolate
No fate seemed
fair as mine
No happiness
So great
And nature, day by day
Has sung
In accents clear
This joyous roundelay
"He loves thee
"He is here
"Fa-la, la-la
"Fa-la, la-la
"He loves
"Thee
"He is here
"Fa-la, la-la
"Fa-la"
Ah, must I
leave thee here
In endless night
to dream
Where joy is dark
and drear
And sorrow
All supreme
Where nature, day by day
Will sing
In altered tone
This weary roundelay
"He loves thee
"He is gone
"Fa-la, la-la
"Fa-la, la-la
"He loves thee
"He is gone
"Fa-la, la-la
"Fa-la"
In 1940
I of age shall be
I'll then return
and claim you
I declare it!
It seems so long
Swear that till then
you will be true to me
Yes, I'll be strong
By all the Stanleys
dead and gone
I swear it!
Oh, here is love
and here is truth
And here is food
for joyous laughter
She will be faithful
He will be faithful
To her sooth
To his sooth
Till we are wed,
and even after
Oh, here is love
and here is truth
She will be faithful
to her sooth
He will be faithful
to his sooth
Till we are wed,
and even after
Till we are wed
And even after
Yes, even after
Oh, here is love
and here is truth
And here is food
for joyous laughter
She will be faithful
He will be faithful
To her sooth
To his sooth
Till we are wed,
and even after
She will be faithful
to her sooth
Till we are wed,
and even after
And after
Even after
Oh, here is love
and here is truth
Oh, here is love
Here's love
Farewell.
No, I am brave
Oh, family descent
How great thy charm,
thy sway, how excellent
Come one and all,
undaunted men in blue
A crisis, now,
affairs are coming to
When the danger's near
Tarantara,
tarantara
We manage to appear
Tarantara
As insensible to fear
As anybody here
Tarantara, tarantara
Ra-ra-tarantara
Sergeant, approach!
Young Frederic
was to have led you
to death and glory
That is not
a pleasant way of putting it
He will not so lead you
For he has allied himself
once more
With his old associates
He has acted shamefully!
You speak falsely
You know nothing about it
He has acted nobly
He has acted nobly
Dearly as
I loved him before
His heroic sacrifice
to his sense of duty
Has endeared him
to me tenfold
He has done his duty,
I will do mine
Go ye and do yours
Right oh!
This is perplexing.
But no matter,
our cause is clear.
We must do our best
to capture
these pirates alone.
It is most distressing
to us to be the agents
Whereby our erring
fellow-creatures
Are deprived
of that liberty
Which is so dear
to us all
But we should have
thought of that
Before we joined
the force
We should
Well, too late now!
When a felon's not engaged
in his employment
His employment
Or maturing
his felonious
little plans
Little plans
His capacity
for innocent enjoyment
'Cent enjoyment
Is just as great
as any honest man's
Honest man's
Our feelings
we with difficulty
smother
'Culty smother
When Constabulary
duty's to be done
To be done
Ah, take
one consideration
with another
With another
A policeman's lot
is not a happy one
Oh
When Constabulary
duty's to be done
To be done
A policeman's lot
is not a happy one
Hoo!
Quiet down there.
Good night.
A rollicking band
of pirates we
Who, tired of tossing
on the sea
Are trying their hand
at a burglary
With weapons
grim and gory
Hush, hush!
I hear them
on the manor poaching
With stealthy steps
the pirates
are approaching
We are not coming
for plate or gold
A story
General Stanley told
We seek a penalty
fifty-fold
For General Stanley's
story
They seek a penalty
Fifty-fold!
We seek a penalty
Fifty-fold!
They seek a penalty
fifty-fold
For General Stanley's story
Quiet!
They come in force
With stealthy stride
Silence! Down.
Our obvious course
is now to hide
Tarantara, tarantara
Go on.
Quiet!
With cat-like tread
Upon our prey we steal
In silence dread
Our cautious way we feel
No sound at all
We never speak a word
A fly's foot-fall
would be distinctly heard
Tarantara, tarantara
So stealthily
the pirate creeps
While all the household
soundly sleeps
Come, friends,
who plough the sea
Truce to navigation
Take another station
Let's vary piracy
With a little burglary
Come, friends,
who plough the sea
Truce to navigation
Take another station
Let's vary piracy
With a little burglary
Quiet!
Here's your crowbar
And your center bit
Your life preserver
You may want to hit
Your silent matches
Your dark lantern seize
Take your file
And your skeletonic keys
Tarantara
With catlike tread
Tarantara
In silence dread
With cat-like tread
Upon our prey we steal
In silence dread
Our cautious way we feel
No sound at all
We never speak a word
A fly's foot-fall
would be distinctly heard
Come, friends,
who plough the sea
Truce to navigation
Take another station

With a little burglary

Our cautious way

Feel!
Who's there?
Hush, hush!
Hello?
Not a word
I see a light inside
The Major-General comes
So, quickly hide
Yes, yes!
The Major-General
comes
Yes, yes!
The Major-General comes
Yes, yes!
The Major-General comes
Tormented
with the anguish dread
of falsehood unatoned
I lay upon
my sleepless bed
And tossed and turned
and groaned
The man who finds
his conscience ache
No peace at all enjoys
And as I lay in bed
awake
I thought I heard a noise
He thought
he heard a noise
Ha, ha!
No, all is still
In dale, on hill
My mind is set at ease
So still the scene
It must have been
The sighing of the breeze
Sighing softly
to the river
Comes the loving breeze
Setting nature
all a-quiver
Rustling through the trees
Through the trees
And the brook
in rippling measure
Laughs for very love
While the poplars
in their pleasure
Wave their arms above
Yes, the trees for very love
Wave their leafy arms above
River, river
little river
May thy loving prosper ever
Heaven speed thee,
poplar tree
May thy wooing happy be
Heaven speed thee,
poplar tree
May thy wooing
Happy be
Yet, the breeze
is but a rover
When he wings away
Brook and poplar
mourn a lover
Sighing, "Well-a-day!"
Well-a-day
Ah, the doing
and undoing
That the rogue
could tell
When the breeze
is out a-wooing
Who can woo so well?
Shocking tales
the rogue could tell
Nobody can woo so well
Pretty brook,
thy dream is over
For thy love
is but a rover
Sad the lot of poplar trees
Courted by a fickle breeze
Sad the lot of poplar trees
Courted by a
Fickle
Breeze
Papa!
Papa! Where are you?
Now what is this
and what is that?
And why does Father
leave his rest
At such a time of night
as this, so very
incompletely dressed?
Dear Father is,
and always was,
the most methodical of men
It's his invariable rule
to go to bed at half-past ten
What strange occurrence
can it be that calls
dear Father from his rest
At such a time of night
as this, so very
incompletely dressed?
So very incompletely dressed
At such a time of night!
Forward, my men,
and seize that
General there!
His life is over!
The pirates!
The pirates!
Oh, despair!
Yes, we're the pirates,
so despair!
Frederic here!
Oh, joy!
Oh, rapture!
Summon your men
and effect their capture!
Frederic, save us!
Beautiful Mabel,
I would if I could,
but I am not able
He's telling the truth,
he is not able
With base deceit
You worked
upon our feelings
Revenge is sweet
And flavors
all our dealings
With courage rare
And resolution manly
For death prepare
Unhappy General Stanley
Is he to die
No!
Unshriven, unannealed?
Oh, spare him!
Will no one in his cause
a weapon wield
Oh, spare him!
Yes, we are here,
though hitherto concealed
Oh, rapture!
What do we do?
So to Constabulary,
pirates yield
Oh, rapture!
To them, lads!
Charge! Ow!
Kill! Kill!
Come on, boy,
sic 'em, sic 'em!
Come on, boy, bite them!
Bite those pirates!
Sit!
Away!
Sailors always
welcome ladies
Most politely
Now give three cheers
I'll lead the way
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Hurray!
Kill them!
To gain a brief advantage
you've contrived
But your proud triumph
will not be long-lived
Don't say you are orphans,
for we know that game
On your allegiance
we've a stronger claim
We charge, you yield
We charge, you yield
In Queen
Victoria's name
You do?
We do!
We charge, you yield
In Queen
Victoria's name
We yield at once
With humbled mien
Because with all our faults
We love
Our Queen
Yes, yes
With all their faults
They love their Queen
Yes, yes
With all their faults
With all our faults
They love their Queen
We love our Queen
Away with them
And place them
at the bar
One moment!
Let me tell you
who they are
They are no members
of the common throng
They are all noblemen
Who have gone wrong
They are all noblemen
Who have gone wrong
No Englishman unmoved
that statement hears
Because,
with all our faults
We love
Our House of Peers
I pray you, pardon me,
ex-Pirate King
Peers will be peers,
and youth
will have its fling
Resume your ranks
and legislative duties
And take my daughters
All of whom are beauties
At length we are provided
with unusual facility
To change piratic crime
for dignified
respectability
Combined I needn't say with
the unparalleled felicity
Of what we have
been longing for
Unbounded domesticity
Tomorrow morning early
we will quickly
be parsonified
Hymeneally coupled,
conjugally matrimonified
And this
shall be accomplished
by the doctor of divinity
Who happily resides
in the immediate vicinity
Who happily resides
in the immediate vicinity
My military knowledge,
though I'm plucky
and adventury
Has only been brought down
to the beginning
of the century
But still
in getting off my daughters
Eight or nine
or ten in all
I've shown myself
the model of
A modern Major-General
But still
in getting off his daughters
Eight or nine
or ten in all
He's shown himself
the model of a modern
Major-General
Poor wandering ones
Though ye have
surely strayed
Take heart of grace,
your steps retrace
Poor wandering ones
Poor wandering ones
If such poor love as ours
Can help you find
True peace of mind
Why, take it
It is yours
Poor wandering ones
Poor wandering ones
Take heart
Take heart
Take, take heart
Take heart
Take heart
Take heart
Take heart
Take heart,
fair days will shine
Take any heart
Take heart
Take heart!
Take
Heart!
