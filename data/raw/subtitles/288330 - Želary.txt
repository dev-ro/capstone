"May 1943"
Yes...?
Speaking... Evening, Slávek.
No, I'm not sleeping;
I'm working...
Cut it out!
Of course it can wait.
Serious? How serious?
I understand.
Some guy was hurt
at a sawmill in the mountains.
They're bringing him in.
- What about tomorrow?
- I have to operate in Prague.
- Some people have all the luck.
- On Thursday I'm all yours.
I've got tickets to the theater.
Damn...
There's an emergency.
- Dr. Littner?
- Yes.
- Hi, Slávek...
- Evening, Richard...
Richard...
How's the patient?
Holding on. By all rights,
we should have lost him.
You're his last chance.
Suction...
I'm off. I've got a long trip
and can be of no more use here.
Say goodbye
to Richard and Slávek.
I will. Goodbye.
Eliška...?
The patient
needs blood immediately.
- What type?
- Yours.

You can't always be lucky.
- I've done it before.
- Exactly.
No one expects it of you;
maybe you've had enough.
Loose the envelope
if there's trouble.
- There won't be.
- Fine.
- Let's go over it again then.
- A four-story corner building...
With exits into two streets.
I use the one by the post
office, 2nd floor, 1st door.
- When do you enter?
- Just after 5 PM.
Two names on the door: Emílie
Fojtková and Aleš Dobøanský.
At 5:03 PM I'll hear a vacuum
cleanerturn on inside.
I slip the envelope in the slot
and exit by the other door.
Good.
Always the same game.
It's getting boring, gentlemen.
Thank you. Excuse me,
may I use your bathroom?
Of course...
Let me just get the light.
Thank you.
We saw you come in...
- Are they searching apartments?
- Not yet.
Wouldn't you like to lie down?
No, thank you. I just
felt a bit dizzy. It's okay.
Thirsty, Mr. Janda?
You're my personal patient;
I must take good care of you.
- You need to drink.
- Thank you, doctor ma'am.
I already told you
I'm not a doctor yet.
How could I be
since they closed the school...
And I'm no ma'am either.
You'll have to wait for both.
We're releasing you soon. Would
you like to write your family?
No family?
I know about having no folks,
or not knowing about them...
Mr. Kukalík, how'd you sleep?
Good.
Good heavens! Sitting there
like a ghost. Where's Richard?
- What're you doing here, Slávek?
- You have to leave. - What?
Here's money, ration coupons,
new work papers, all documents.
- New personal data. Commit it
to memory. - Are you crazy?
No. The Gestapo got Fojtková
and Dobøanský; they may talk.
Tonight you're taking
an ambulance to Køenovice.
What will I do there?
Continue on by train with Janda,
the man you donated blood to.
- You can't return here anymore.
- And Richard? I need to see him.
- Impossible. Get packed and go.
- I want to hear it from him.
Richard's gone. He emigrated.
Nonsense! No one can emigrate.
Tell me the truth. I can take it.
- That's what we counted on.
- Dammit, This isn't possible!
It is possible!
Richard emigrated
and left you this.
He took off and left me this?
I'm supposed to believe that?
This wasn't part of the game! Am
I the only one who didn't know?
- No one knew and everyone did...
- And everyone was ready but me!
Please, be quiet!
Your relationship was public,
so we'll say you emigrated too.
The Gestapo'll probably buy it.
- Where'll you go?
- Don't worry. Give me your keys.
- I'm going home. - No! You can't
be seen! Give me your keys.
What do I do now?
Learn your new identity.
There, there, sweetie,
don't tremble.
- Slávek, come with me.
- Pull yourself together...
You'll get your bag in Tynec,
some clothes and personal stuff.
Dr. Beníèek will have it; he's
the man who brought Janda in.
Nothing to be afraid of;
he'll guard you with his life.
Beníèek vouched for him.
- What's he wearing?
- The shoes and pants are his.
The coat, shirt, and briefcase
are mine; there's food in it.
I left some photos
at Richard's place.
Don't worry, I'll clean up.
Bye, Eliška.
I'm a doctor.
I'm carrying medicine
and food forthe sick.
Here's the receipt
and inventory.
- And this?
- Personal belongings.
Personal belongings?
And this? Hardly yours...
They are a bit small...
I have some old clothes forthe
patients; they have so little.
They're lucky to have you...
You may go.
I'll leave the bag in the train.
Joza?
That's what they call you,
isn't it?
You know the danger I'm in...
I've got to hide and
I don't know for how long.
You have to forget who I was.
Now I'm Hana Hofmanová.
- Didn't Dr. Chládek tell you?
- He did, miss.
We needn't be so formal.
My name's Hana...
- Your hands are like ice, miss.
- Miss?
Your hands are like ice, Hana.
Your hands are like ice, Hana.
- We're here.
- Where?
Šádová Hu.
Watch out forthe mud, miss.
Must you be so formal?
No.
You'll have to stay here a bit
till I find something else.
We can't stay at my old place,
but I'll find an empty cottage.
- You have empty cottages?
- From those who left or died.
- You didn't die?
- No. Waiting for your beau?
For Lipka and he's not my beau.
He got caned again yesterday.
- Did a fairy save you?
- She's one of us.
Helenka...
She's Žeòa Bojarová's.
She can stay a few days, Joza,
if we're good enough for her...
- I'm not asking any questions.
- Good idea.
I'll talk
to the principal about her.
So you made it back...
You look betterthan before.
Želary-celery,
chickenshit smellery...
Želary-celery,
chickenshit smellery...
- Why are they teasing her?
- She's from Želary. That's why.
Thank you.
You scared me...
You've acted very dangerously.
Slávek wouldn't have sent me
here if he'd known.
He's dead.
The Gestapo came for him.
And if they catch you,
they'll execute everyone
who helped you, including me.
I'm taking you back.
You'll go to Želary,
marry Janda, and I won't
ever hear about you again.
A fairy saved Joza Janda.
I saw her.
No such thing as fairies.
A plane!
German. Flying in the clouds.
And she is too a fairy.
You're just a stuck-up brat!
Forthe last time, who stole
boards from Burda's fence?
Confession eases the soul...
Lipka,
come with me to my office.
If he beats you again,
bite another one of his fingers.
The cane solves nothing.
Šádová Huis in a rut.
Chickenshit stinky butt.
Kids from the Hu
like to shake their butt.
Better hope Lipka
doesn't wring your necks!
Šádová Huis in a rut.
Chickenshit stinky butt.
Kids from the Hu
like to shake their butt.
Are you happy?
Trying our patience?
You think it's worth
the beating, don't you?
Beat it!
Get out of my sight!
Out!
- You got punished, eh?
- Not today.
Nice of the principal
to let you off.
He didn't...
When he beats me he lets me off.
You're with Joza, huh?
Joza from the sawmill?
Yeah... that's right...
I assumed you knew you couldn't
just waltz around like this.
I don't want to see you outside,
ortalking to the children.
Children can't keep secrets,
and they're my responsibility.
Take yourthings back inside
and wait till they come for you!
Come in!
- Praise Jesus...
- Forever and a day...
Can't sleep either? I can't
sleep since she's been here...
- What do you want?
- I came to thank you for Lipka.
- It was nothing...
- You maintain strong discipline.
The last principal
couldn't compare.
But that's the only thing I've
accomplished with the cane.
Most of the kids here
are headed forthe gallows.
That's where we're mistaken:
A child's soul is a flower bud.
Then what hemlock
did Lipka bloom from?
Though he'll be gone soon, I'm
still telling his stepfather.
Don't.
Save your compassion
forthose who need it.
His stepfather will kill him;
what about your conscience then?
What makes you think I have one?
Please, rethink this!
I'm applying for a transfer...
Come in...
Lord keep us!
Sorry to disturb you;
I'd like to speak to the priest.
- Have you come for her?
- Yes, principal.
Let's go outside.
Thanks for everything.
There's not much furniture
but I'll make some soon.
There's a kitchen,
bedroom, front room, shed...
Lucka lives up there,
Žeòa next to her...
And Juriga lives down below.
Where's the yard?
Everywhere.
There's no electricity
but you'll get used to it.
Have a seat...
I have to take
the horse back to the mill.
It'll be warm soon.
Sit closerto the stove.
That's Azor.
Now I've got two guards.
Tea will be ready soon.
Tomorrow's Saturday.
I arranged the wedding...
without banns.
The priest
will help register you
in Želary and with the parish.
I'd like to wash and go to bed.
Good night.
- This is Žeòa Bojarová.
- Good morning.
Get out of here!
Žeòa will dress you.
What for?
I think I'm capable.
- You need different clothes.
- My clothes are fine.
- You can't get married in them.
- What's that supposed to mean.
You're all so sure I'm marrying
Mr. Janda, but maybe I'm not!
There's no other way.
Then I'lljust go
and yourtroubles will be over.
- You've got nowhere to go.
- You're all mad or I'm dreaming?
You're not telling me
what I can and cannot do.
Sorry...
I told you to stay outside!
How will you make me?
There's no other way.
They wouldn't accept you.
Why don't we eat something?
Cheers...
What's that?
Clothes from
the theater group we had here.
You could use
this wig and this dress...
orthis one...
My clothes are fine; I don't
need to dress like a clown.
- You can't wearthem.
- Why? - The local people...
- And because of your hair, too.
- My hair?
Wearthis
until your hair grows out.
They're coming! They're coming!
Morning! Good morning!
I assume you don't have a recent
copy of your birth certificate?
Will you try to get one later?
I suppose you have no idea
what I'm to use to register you?
Your presence here in Želary
is forcing me to commit fraud.
I hope, at least,
you are aware of that.
I am in an unenviable position.
I can turn you in and endanger
all those who have helped you.
Or I can marry you and pray
that no one else turns you in.
God help you
from being arrested...
Well, I hope
you're single at least.
At the ceremony
I have to ask three questions;
I'd like the answers now:
Do you enter
into matrimony willingly?
Yes.
Yes.
- Are you under pressure to marry
- No, not at all.
Not at all.
Do you wish to have offspring?
What will you say
before witnesses?
Yes.
Yes.
Fine.
I'd like to pray
before the ceremony. Alone.
Thank you, father, thank you.
Forest, forest,
oh, forest green,
Come, lass, I'm home alone,
Home alone, all are at mass,
Come to my bed, come, my lass...
Sorry, but I don't know
how to dance like this.
Don't worry, I'm drunk too.
You have a fine wife, Joza!
You whore!
- You whore!
- Stop that! Leave her alone!
Stay the hell out of it,
you dirty slut!
He hit you again?
You should've killed him!
Can I sleep here?
The bench is hard.
I have to tell you something.
I was unfaithful to you.
Not today, before.
Down in Šádová Hu. With Irèa,
the one you stayed with.
How could it matter?
She's used to sleeping with me.
I don't mind.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm not used to the stove.
I'm helping mow
Juriga's meadow tomorrow.
Then they'll
help us with the floor.
Morning.
- Pretty here, huh?
- You're right about that.
Police are scarce around here.
The Germans use a back road.
So I heard.
You're safe here.
And there's no reason
to be afraid of us.
I asked myself,
where'd she find that old goat?
He's lived alone for years.
Then one day all those logs
fall on him, near kill him,
and he comes back with a young
gal who doesn't suit him at all.
I met Joza at the hospital.
A person has to wonder
what a young city thing
would see in such an old goat.
What's there to like?
Various things come to mind:
Maybe she doesn't like him,
just needs a place to hide.
Someplace far away
where no one will find her.
- Get your hands off me, you pig!
- Oh, don't worry...
We'll have
more chances to dance.
Lunch!
Lunch!
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.
Sit.
Him too...
Enjoy the meal.
I broke the lamp.
It doesn't matter.
I'll tell young Juriga.
He'll bring another
from Šádová Hu tomorrow.
You'll like it.
You'll see.
Don't cry.
You'll have a new one
tomorrow, Hanulka...
- Shouldn't I call you that?
- You can...
That lamp doesn't matter.
You're not mad, Joza?
I brought you some books
from Šádová Hu.
The priest said
they might help with boredom.
So that's your plan: If I read
I won't touch anything. Thanks.
Azor, stay.
Evening, Mr. Janda.
May we come in?
- What's your business?
- I need to sort out some papers.
- God keep us!
- Evening.
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
Have a seat.
Bring drinks forthe guests.
We have to register you, ma'am.
I'll need to see your papers.
Fill this out:
Address, name, age...
Born 1924?
If you were single you'd have
gone to work in the Reich, eh?
To bad we didn't meet her
before Mr. Janda did!
Any domestic animals?
Cross it out then.
Here's a voucher for ration
coupons, and we're all through.
Sign it, please.
Respect the black out.
No lights at night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Farewell.
I'll teach you how to do it.
Good afternoon.
Hello, kids.
- Hello, principal.
- Hello.
What can I get you?
Run out of honey?
No... I just wanted to ask...
Do you know your Helenka
is friends with Lipka?
- Of course; everyone knows.
- You've given your permission?
- I haven't forbidden her.
- He's not a good influence.
Helenka is an intelligent child.
She could already start school.
But Lipka is a loser, a hoodlum.
He grew up fatherless
and his stepfather drinks.
- Helenka has no father either.
- Yes, but she's sensitive.
But under Lipka's influence
she's obstinate and standoffish.
It seems the opposite to me.
You realize that Lipka will
become an outcast and a thug.
- What boy is better?
- He's like a wolf.
You don't know him as I do.
It's appalling.
Threats and beatings?
Like water off a duck's back.
But I do know him.
They're my kids.
- Not Lipka...
- He's Helenka's brother.
- What?
- Milk brother.
What's that?
I nursed him
when his mother lost her milk,
- after I'd lost Matušek.
- Milk brother, eh?
That's right, principal.
As you wish, Mrs. Bojarová.
I was concerned about Helenka.
I can see how busy you are...
so I won't detain you.
- God keep you.
- And you.
The floor's ready.
Come have a look... Hanulka.
You bastard!
No, daddy!
You don't lift a finger
at school or at home!
No, daddy!
Michal!
Get off!
Don't come back, you freeloader!
Why do you hound him?
Must he sneak home like a thief?
This isn't his home. I don't
want to see your bastard again!
- Going to town tomorrow?
- Yes.
I need a couple things.
- I can't read this. - Soap.
I need it for laundry and...
I didn't want to say it, but
you could use it occasionally.
- We'll go together.
- I shouldn't be seen.
I'd like
to show you to my mother.
Like to tell her I married.
You have a mother?
I was in Želary
to see Lipka's stepfather.
Now something for you:
I'm worried about him...
about Lipka.
I'm afraid
that brute will nearly kill him.
I wanted it, wanted that animal
to be an extension of my arm.
Now tell me
who's the bigger brute.
Who will God's wrath strike?
Sometimes I envy your pure soul.
You're wrong.
I know. Even saints sin.
Seven times a day, isn't it?
May I touch you.
Yes.
Okay children, who can
name ten forest creatures?
- A flea!
- What are you doing here?
And a frog, a worm, a snail,
a wasp, a rabbit, and a bear...
That's seven. Okay,
a badger, an owl, and a trout.
- You like school? - It's pouring
outside. - Who taught you that?
- Lipka. He knows them all.
- He should be here, not you.
I'm here instead of him.
He's not coming again. Ever.
It stopped raining. My goat
must be completely soaked.
Let's continue!
"Autumn 1943"
Get into your little cottage;
you'll be warm there in winter.
Azor!
Joza...
Well, shit...
You look frightened.
This is Lucka Vojnièková.
- What is it?
- Drink up!
There was a swamp
and an old house...
She got all the way
to the old mill.
