Man:
How do you do that??
Hey, Daddy, look at me!!
Woman: I'm not wearing
any underwear+
Are you going
to be able to concentrate?
Not if you aren't her e+
( laughs )
I'm on my way+
We hit some weather
in Washington,
so I just got off
the plane+
I don't think
I'll make curtain,
but I won't miss
y our entrance+
Have I ever missed?
( laughs )
What's wrong?
Today is the last show+
Aw+ Ar e y ou sad for us
or for the show?
For us+
Oh, I'm touched+
(phone beeps)
Hold on+
Hang on, Victor+
- Hey, what's up?
- Client doesn't like London now+
- Is Paris set up?
- Yeah+
- I just have to talk to Brian+
- Alr eady did, he's fine with it+
Looking forwar d to seeing us
in New York for a champagne toast+
I said,
""Friday would be okay?""
Sounds fine+
I'll call y ou later, okay?
- ( phone beeps )
- Russell?
- Sorry, baby+
- Russell: That y our husband?
Uh-huh+
Now wher e wer e we?
Oh y eah, my underwear+
Look, I didn't want to tell y ou
this over the phone, but+++
I've f allen
in love with y ou+
( phone beeps )
Shit, hold on+
What is it, Victor?
I am counting on y ou
for dinner, y ou know+
Why?
Victor:
What do y ou mean, why?
George is dawdling
on this thing+
He desir es y ou and I think he can
close it tonight, that's why+
You know, I don't think
I can make it+
But I'll try
to make dessert, okay?
Don't wait for me+
George?
Thanks for holding+
Listen, 9:00 might be better
if it's not too late+
Good+
( phone beeps )
- Russell?
- Yes+
We had a deal, r emember?
So y ou'r e just going
to have to deal
with me pining and moaning over
what we might've had together+
You didn't hang up+
Woman: Not y et+
So what does that mean?
I can't do this+
If y ou'r e going to bail,
y ou'd best do it now+
( phone beeps )
Sweet+
But y ou didn't
scar e her away+
Sounded too much
like y ou meant it+
I did+
Man: 10 minutes
till curtain every one+
Her e we go, folks+
Last night+
Well, then I f eel
like Cupid+
Please, don't hurt her
if that's what this is about+
Do y ou believe in God?
Russell:
Yes, I do+
Lif e's a walking shadow,
a poor play er, that struts
and fr ets his hour
upon the stage
then is hear d no mor e+
It's a tale told
by an idiot
full of sound and fury
signifying+++
nothing+
If y ou move or speak,
this blows+
It's very sensitive+
For the next f ew moments
y ou'r e going to be closer
to y our God
than y ou've ever been+
Don't waste it+
Man: Early curtain
tonight, every one+
Let's get going+
( sighs )
( whispering )
Help+
( whistling )
What, motherfucker?
Jeez,
say something, fool+
Man: Hey, Dwayne,
how's the salmonella business?
Dwayne:
Hey, Papa Chulo+
I got kosher, man+
I got turkey,
100%beef, y ou know,
and all that good stuff+
- What, no vegetarian?
- I got vegan, best on the market+
Can't tell
the diff er ence+
Forget it+
Me, I'm going to go all the way+
- 100%beef+
- And lips+
It's true+ What do y ou think
they do with the lips, man?
Anus and spleen
and all that stuff+
It's all 100%cow+
V ery funny+
I'll see y ou
next week+
Give my r egar ds
to y our boss+
( Dwayne chuckles )
Man:
Russell?
Has any one seen Russell?
Woman: Did y ou lose
my little darling again?
He told me he'd be back by now+
Have y ou seen him?
In the carnal sense?
No, not y et+
Hey, find the ice queen
rich bitch and y ou'll find him+
- Russell+
- Help+
- ( jiggles knob )
- Russell?
Please don't do this
to me again+
Russell y ou will personally
be r esponsible for my heart attack+
Five minutes, every one+
( br eathing heavily )
She's still not
in her seat?
He left a message on my cell
10 minutes ago
saying he would be her e
10 minutes ago+
Shit+ Okay,
five mor e minutes, every one+
- Should I be getting dr essed?
- Fuck off+
Okay+
I'll get dr essed anyway,
just in case+
( beeping )
So y ou want to spot me
another gram?
- It's the weekend+
- Can't do that, Mel+
I got a big day, bro'+
Look, I'm going to tell y ou
something, man+
My boss is a mean
son of a bitch, all right?
I got kids, y ou know?
A hundr ed+ I'll give y ou
the r est Monday-- end of day+
Don't be waving that shit
around her e, man+
Jesus+
- Hey+
- I swear+
- You the man, Dwayne+
- Whatever+
Hello, Dwayne+
Hey !
- Has it been a week alr eady?
- Yeah+
Last performance tonight+
We'r e having a big party+
Yeah?
Well ,they got some big numbers
coming in from New York next+
- Oh, y eah+
- Yeah+
Big deal+
( snorting )
Oh+
Wow+
You take car e
of y ourself, huh?
Got a good thing going on,
y ou and me, huh?
( cell phone rings )
Liberty Wallace+
Man: Nice to meet y ou,
Liberty Wallace+
- My name's Joe+
- What could I do for y ou, Joe?
Stand still+
Ex cuse me?
I'll need y ou
to pay attention+
Look, I'm late for a play+
Who is this?
Joe: You mean y ou'r e late
for y our weekly fuck?
Asshole+
( phone beeps, rings )
( cell phone ringing )
Look, asshole, whoever y ou ar e,
if y ou call one mor e time--
Joe: I didn't expect
to like Russell+
But then again, I guess y ou
didn't expect to like him either+
About a half hour?
Joe:
Dwayne had to take a whiz+++
( gasps )
+++so he needs y ou
to step in+
What do y ou want?
Joe: Calm+
Walk over
to the hot dog stand+
You need to be closer+
Aah!
Joe: You need to know
I've locked a signal
onto y our cell number+
Ther e's a bomb,
a r eally big bomb,
in that hot dog stand+
I'll shoot
innocent people+
We've got
a bit of ground to cover,
so I don't want
to have to kill y ou+
Walk closer
to the stand+
If y our cell phone
goes dead
or y ou touch the mute button
for any r eason, it'll blow+
It's irr eversible translation+
No off switch+
Ther e's enough
explosive in ther e
to take out
the whole block+
So+++
y ou have a little problem
on y our hands+
Now take a br eath+
Liberty, could please
check y our battery?
'Cause we need to know
how much time we have+
It's half charged+
Joe: That gives us
about 80 minutes+
Ther e's a pair of cuff s
hanging on the cart+
You've got quite
a decision to make+
Tell me what y ou want+
Your soul+
Fine, name a price+
Do y ou r eally think
I'd go through all this trouble
for cash?
You'r e going to have
put on that ankle cuff+
Then we'r e going
to have a talk+
Do it+
- Do it+
- No!
Okay, okay+
Joe: No+
On y our ankle, please+
Tug+
Show me it's secur e+
Good+
Okay, now I'll make
an honest man of my self+
Open the top left door
of the cart+
Liberty: Jesus+
Joe: I'm guessing y ou know
what that is+
I take it y ou have
some political affiliations+
Joe: No+
That's the problem+
I need y ours+
Look, we could just cut
to the chase her e+
I'm guessing y ou have a 223+
It's sophisticated+
- You mean expensive+
- That too+
- Which means y ou'r e connected+
- Yeah+
All right, y ou've got me
standing still+ What's next?
Easy+
I get to decide
how this goes down+
- ( phone beeps )
- Joe: I know it's not Russell,
because he's backstage
thinking about y our futur e+
He's wondering whether y ou
put y our panties back on
and ar e making
a run for it+
I'm sur e y ou'r e wondering
if I'm working for y our husband+
I'm not+
If he knew about Russell
he'd take it har d
and he's a very
violent man+
Hey, is Dwayne around?
No, he stepped away+
Is he going
to be back soon?
Did he leave anything
for Frank?
Tell him something,
he looks desperate+
- No+
- What?
No, I don't eat meat+
- ( Joe laughs )
- Thank y ou+
He thinks y ou warned him
about the cops+
You having fun, Joe?
Yes+
But not like y ou think+
How much do y ou want?
Nothing+
It's not about cash+
It's about y ou+
You have two choices--
First, y ou die
an American hero+
Second+++
y ou die still working
for the f at man+
Look, I have accounts
all over the world+
I have unlimited r esour ces+
Tell me how much y ou want+
Is it all champagne
inside that pr etty head?
I don't see
wher e this is going+
Ah, Liberty+
Memory lane+
The former y ou+
Lif e befor e
the Bulgari handbag+
What happened?
- You know my husband--
- Can't pin this on him+
He's just a thug
working on any side of the law
that'll give out
a check+
By the medals he earned during
his stint with the military,
some would say
he's a hero+
And what would y ou say,
Liberty?
I don't think
this is about
what I think
of my husband's track r ecor d+
Do heroes pray for war so that
they can sell their bullets?
We never discuss
our business+
Okay, Liberty+
You'r e in my sightline,
y ou'r e standing
next to a bomb,
and y ou'r e not at liberty
to discuss
that y ou and y our husband
manuf actur e guns
and sell them
to any fucking country,
or str eet asshole,
or all-American kid
who'll pay y ou the cash+
( scoff s )
Hooray for
the American dr eam+
If y ou want something,
ask for it,
otherwise,
I'm just going to hang up+
Go ahead+
Is this about
the sale to Poland?
- Serbia+
- Poland+
( sighs )
Denial is a curious thing+
The shipment
never made it to Poland+
Serbians, Croats--
kids on both sides+++
all died+
What's the fucking diff er ence?
So y ou wer e ther e?
( beeping slowly )
( beeping f ast )
( beeping slowly )
Go on, honey+
Hot dog, please+
Sur e+ Sur e+
No mustar d+
I said no mustar d+
Cute+ Don't make me
pull the trigger+
- He's just a kid+
- I have nothing to lose, Liberty+
Or haven't y ou figur ed
that out y et?
Go+
You know,
y ou know a lot about me+
What I'm thinking,
who I'm fucking--
just amazing, Joe+
And I'm y our only friend
at this moment+
- My final conf essor+
- That too+
So y ou whacking off
right now, baby, hmm?
Working out some
domination bullshit?
Tr ead car efully,
dear heart+
Why? In this game of y ours,
the way I see it,
I die either way+
May as well have some fun+
VP Marketing, McCloud,
standar d in American weaponry+
Kind of like Ber etta is
to the Italians+
Ah, so that's
what this is about+
Your dilemma is+++
when to pull the plug+++
pull the plug+++
Who ar e y ou going
to take with y ou?
And who ar e y ou going
to take with y ou?
Aah!
Man:
What was that?
Now+++
y ou've just been shot at
by y our best-selling rifle+
How does it f eel?
How's it supposed to f eel?
Real+
Fine, I'm terrified+
Is that what y ou want me to say?
Well, it's a start+
And y ou've got
a little over an hour
to sound like
y ou r eally mean it+
( sighs )
You want to know what makes me
so twisted?
Crazy?
The why of it all?
It's kind of funny+
Right now I f eel absolutely sane+
But I know what it's like
to be twisted and crazy+
Something I don't think
that y ou've
ever experienced+
Liberty:
Well, I've had my moments+
Don't compete+
You'r e right, y ou'r e probably
crazier than I've ever been+
( Joe laughs )
Man: I'll take a long walk,
and then y ou'll know+
I mean, I don't have to+++
Good God, he sucks+
I can't go out ther e+
( beeping )
So, y ou'r e quite a shot+
Yeah+ I started
with BBs and squirr els+
You'r e a pr etty
crack shot y ourself+
Well, y ou know, my f ather wanted
a competition kid,
so I went for the medals+
You know what he did to me
the first time he took me
out in the bush?
He shot this deer+
The deer had a f awn+
You know
what he made me do?
He made me shoot it+
Close range+
And y ou pulled
the trigger+
I hated him
for making me do it+
- I had nightmar es+
- How ironic+
Yeah+
Come on, let's get back
to the point+
Why ar e
y ou doing this, Joe?
You must meet
all kinds in y our business+
- Why do they?
- Come on, I sell corporately+
It's not like I deal
with every asshole
who wants to wave
a big dick at something+
So it's about my dick?
( applause )
What if Russell
slit his wrists?
We should call
the police+
Slit his wrists?
Russell's the happiest man
I've ever met+
Happiness is the best cover
for clinical depr ession+
What? Did he tell y ou
he was depr essed?
The man is dating a barracuda+
What's not to be depr essed about?
You know, we'r e in a bit
of a time jam her e+
This guessing game's
getting a bit tiring+
Why don't y ou just tell me
what's going on?
Fair enough+
I want y ou
to understand loss+
You lost someone+++
to a gun accident?
No accident+
A willful act+
Pr emeditated+
Liberty:
Your wif e?
Son?
( Liberty sighs )
Your daughter+
Look, I'm r eally sorry
for y ou and y our f amily,
but is this how
she'd want y ou to act?
She's not alive to ask+
Liberty: Why would y ou want
mor e blood on y our hands?
Misery needs company+
The blood is going
to spill into y our hands,
wher e it belongs,
Liberty+
Ther e's hundr eds of people
who trade weapons+
I'm just one tiny speck
in all of this--
That's all it takes+
Pr esidents
and thr ee-y ear-olds die
all in the name
of the Constitution+
They have metal detectors
and cops in schools+
Is that what makes
America gr eat?
Okay,
I get wher e this is going+
I'll denounce
my involvement in weapons,
I'll denounce
the industry, fuck,
I'll denounce death
in general, okay?
We'll get the pr ess her e,
we'll cause a big scene+
Is that what y ou want?!
You'r e so full of shit+
Liberty: Look, I know
y ou must be dying inside,
but I'm standing next
to a goddamn bomb,
and it's going to cause
some serious damage+
So if y ou want coverage,
come on, let's get it going+
What wer e y our f ather's
last wor ds?
He has nothing to do
with this+
Yeah, I guess blowing
y our brains out is--
is about as much
as any one person can ever say+
( laughs )
You seem to know a lot
about me and my f amily, Joe+
Joe: It's personal+
And I get to atone
for the sins
of every cheap-suit
fucking gun salesman?
Yeah, and y our f ather+
He has nothing
to do with this+ Fuck y ou!
This has nothing to do
with my f ather+
This is about y ou
going postal!
He's part
of the f amily legacy+
Liberty: Bullshit!
He is not+
- He is not!
- You wer e an impr essionable kid+
His money bought y ou
into a society
on both sides
of the law+
He's definitely
a part of this+
No he isn't+
( wolf whistles )
Try that $5, 000 watch
y ou'r e wearing+
- Fine+
- Oh, better y et,
that $25, 000
wedding ring+
Liberty: You got it+
Say, honey+++
( police radio chatter )
Wher e's Dwayne,
Ms+ Liberty Wallace?
Oh, he had to step away+
I'm watching the stand+
You doing this
for a r eason?
Joe: You tell him,
I shoot him+
It's hot today+
Joe: His lif e is
in y our hands, Liberty+
Put y our clothes on+
Yeah! I'll take whatever
y ou'r e selling+
Beat it+
A hot dog for the road+
Oops+
- Good for sales+
- I said beat it!
All right+
Whatever y ou'r e on, lady,
get mor e of it+
You'r e pissing me off+
I'll be right back+
Uh-huh+
You'r e signing
his death warrant+
Is that what y ou want?
It's show time+
( officer grunts )
Your actions
have consequences+
You shot him?
God, y ou shot him+
He's dying as we speak+
( gasping )
Tell me what y ou want+
For one,
y our company just made
a deal worth
several million dollars+
You'r e not going
to deliver+
( officer groaning )
Officer,
ar e y ou all right?
Oh my God+
( phone dialing )
Hello?
Yeah, ther e's an officer her e+
He's bleeding+
I don't know, I think
the corner of 9th and Grace?
Joe:
Fuck him he was a bad cop+
That dick did it
on the take+
My name?
It's George+
McCannister+
I'm just standing her e,
I don't r eally want--
Yeah, I'll wait+
I guess+
A fucking lot of people
ar e about to arrive+
This is y our window
of opportunity, Liberty+
- Let's call y our husband+
- No, don't+
- I'll thr ee-way y ou+
- Don't!
( phone dials, rings )
Secr etary: McCloud Industries,
Victor Wallace's office+
- Yes, is he ther e, please?
- May I say who's calling?
- Liberty+
- Ex cuse me?
His wif e+
I'm calling for his wif e,
who asked me to call
because she's
in a bit of a jam right now+
Secr etary:
Please hold+
Make a copy
and distribute it
to code r ed
level security+
Secr etary: Mr+ Wallace,
y our wif e is on the line, sir+
( clears throat )
- What's up, Lib?
- Joe: She's on the other line+
We'r e conf er enced+
And who is this?
I'm Joe+ Your wif e's cuff ed
to a bomb wir ed to blow
if the cell phone dies+
I've also got one of y our rifles
pointed at her
so I can shoot her
or any one else I figur e
isn't working out+
Liberty?
( phone hangs up )
Joe: Oops+ Is he alway s
that sympathetic?
He probably thinks
y ou'r e a terrorist+
Terrorist?
Why is that?
Because of the deals
y ou cut with Senator Tollman?
Government involvement
is classified+
Man: Hey, they'r e
on their way, all right?
Just hold on a second+
Your husband
just hung up on y ou+
That's because he thought
he was protecting me+
We signed a no-deals policy
so we wouldn't be vulnerable
to every--
every fucking terrorist+
It was a condition
for the military+
Oh, please+
What does signing a contract
r eally have to do with it?
( cell phone beeps )
Don't answer+
( cell phone beeps )
- Victor: Liberty?
- Hey, it's me+
It's for r eal+ I'm at the corner
of 9th and Grace+
I have about 45 minutes
left on my battery+
( gunshot, scr eams )
Liberty, talk to me+
Any idea who we'r e dealing with?
No+
He said something about us
bailing on a deal+
I don't know
what he's talking about+
The only one big enough
is the one going through Paris+
- Nothing mor e specific?
- No!
I don't get it+
How did y ou leave it
with Washington?
Done+
The money's wir ed+
What does he want?
Hijack the shipment?
What does he want?
( scr eams )
I don't know what he wants!
He won't tell me+
- This could be goodby e+
- Don't get dramatic+
If they wanted y ou dead,
y ou would be+
I'm hanging up now+
I'm on it+
- I don't fucking believe y ou+
- If y ou do that again+++
I'll shoot innocent people
on y our behalf+
Oh, he didn't even
say goodby e, did he?
Well, he's got
a lot at stake+
International arms dealing
is tricky business+
No loy alties+
Call Brian+
- I alr eady did+
- Oh, good boy+
V ery good boy+
This is a hostage situation+
Your hands ar e tied+
( sighs )
What am I supposed
to do now,
go and sip tea
in a saf ehouse
while my wif e is
chained to a bomb?
Calm down+
You'r e a target too+
She knows the drill+
You both signed
the security agr eement+
- The machinery just kicked in+
- I'm calm+ I'm very calm+
( sir en wailing )
Shit+
Officer #1:
Step away+
Officer #2: Did y ou see
what happened her e?
I didn't see anything+
1986 r equest backup+
Request immediate backup+
Shots fir ed, officer down,
possibly dead+
Officer #2: Oh my God+
He's bar ely got a pulse+
Do y ou have
an open marriage,
or is it all just pr etend
from the beginning?
I'm sur e this isn't
about our marriage+
But I'm the last person y ou'r e
going to speak to on this Earth,
so might as well
tell me everything+
- He'll hunt y ou down+
- He might hunt y ou down+
You just became
a security risk+
You know, they took out JFK
over the price of oil,
so I'd say y our chances
of being a military target
ar e pr etty high+
Like y ou said,
the stakes ar e high+
Joe: This is all mor e important
than an individual+++
Am I right? Is that what
y ou tell y ourself every day?
I'm only a cog
in the gr eat wheel of misfortune+
That's the way it is+
Joe: How did y ou
end up her e?
How the fuck
did that happen?
I can make a deal
or br eak one+
I have my own connections+
Get back to y our
little theater gig,
backstage every Thursday+++
body guar ds, off limits,
of course+
Do y ou pr etend,
it's passion,
or is it like
taking Prozac?
Liberty:
Leave Russell out of this+
( bleeping )
( Russell inhales )
He better be dead, or I swear
to God I'm going to kill him+
Call his publicist+
She'll know wher e
he's hiding+
You'r e on, folks+
( clapping )
( clapping )
Name y our terms, Joe+
This is about dignity+
My daughter's death
robbed her of hers,
You'r e going to dr edge up whatever
little nobility y ou have left+++
and give the world a little
of what she had+
Can't believe
she'd want this+
She was a fighter+
Unlike y ou,
I wasn't+
I had to make a choice+
Jump out the window,
or live by the rules
that she died by+
What happened to her?
A boy in her school+
Armed and fucked up+
Headlines that make every
mommy and daddy in America
cross their fingers--
Ah, but for the grace
of God go I+
So+++
now I'm using the same right
to bear arms that he had+
It's an all-in package,
I was told+
And y ou can't fuck with fr eedom--
to quote a phrase+
How do y ou know that?
Joe: What?
Your f ather's last wor ds+++
Ah+ Brilliant+
Brilliant way to go out,
I thought+
In f act, it's+++
it was what made me choose
y ou as the spokesperson+
Nobody knew what
my dad's note said+
( clinking )
Just fucking shoot me+
Get it over with,
I'm sick of y our bullshit+
How do y ou know
so much about me?
I'm good with details+
Liberty: Nobody knew
what was in that note, Joe+
Only the cops,
it was a long time ago,
the files ar e filed+
Unless y ou'r e a cop+
Is that it?
What makes y ou think
y ou should do this?
You don't have kids,
so y ou don't know+
God+++
Bless America,
Just give us a minute,
stay ther e+
( loudly singing )
What do y ou make of that?
Stand beside her+++
Psy ch war d+
She may have seen something+
I'll check it out+
( loudly singing )
Hey, get back her e+
I don't want them
getting any closer+
What do y ou got
y our hands in the air for?
Don't come any closer+
Looks like y our husband
sent some goons
to protect y ou
and y our r elationships+
He has Washington,
the Middle East,
the May or's office,
the police, the mob+
You guy s work on
all sides of the f ence+
Must be har d to keep track+
Did y ou see what
happened over ther e?
This is r eally about Victor+
You'r e a package+
What?
Now it's time
to make y our deal with God+
- Officer: You all right?
- Joe: Say no+
His walkie signal
is a bad thing
for sensitive explosives
detonators+
Get back!
Ther e's a bomb
in her e+
Did she say bomb?
So+++
The chick's a looney+
Now what?
Well, thank y ou,
for getting
the ball rolling
but improvise again
and everything goes boom+++
She said ther e's a bomb+
Let's call the Henry guy s,

Give us some space,

You know I'm alway s
on the hunt for that Emmy+
Yeah+ We've got
nothing for y ou, y et+
Family hasn't been informed,

What happened?
Bill, we've been

Just back off, y ou'll be
the first to know, I promise+
Okay+ Yeah+
Promises, promises+
Dispatch: One Adam 9 7,

Repeat+ One Adam 9 7,

Bill Tollman+
Look at the hotdog stand+
She can tell
y ou the story+
No cameras y et+
Stay on the phone+
I want to know who y ou ar e
befor e I get any deeper into this+
You wer e happy to get
a tip 20 minutes ago+
Why all the sudden
the change of heart?
Because a cop is down+
Joe: Then y ou can help+
You'r e the only one
I'll let her talk to+
She saw it all+
Dispatch: One Adam 18,
Alameda and 11th+++
ETA, 12 minutes+
Bill!
Jesus Christ Bill+
Get back her e+
The bomb squad's
on the way+
I got a guy on the cell phone,
tells me she's got the whole story+
Son of a bitch+
Wait until he gets back her e+
No one-- not y ou, not us--
goes over ther e+
I swear to God
I'll take y ou down, Bill+
Now get back her e+
( sir ens wailing )
Joe:
Welcome to our party+
We'r e conf er enced+
A-team, Liberty Wallace,
please let me introduce
y ou to Bill Tollman+
We'r e lucky to have
Bill join us+
He's ambitious, smart,
and for the most part+++
honest+
I'm sorry+
And y ou ar e?
I'm Joe+
I'm out for vengeance+
Liberty needs forgiveness+
And we both need publicity+
Why me?
Your lucky day+
Why don't y ou bring
him up to speed, Liberty?
He's got a military-issue,
sniper rifle pointed right at y ou+
He's an ex cellent shot+
Ther e's a bomb
in the hot dog cart+
It's set to blow, if my cell phone
battery dies, for any r eason+
The bomb's big enough
to blow up this entir e block+
Think Oklahoma+
That theater's going to let out
in less than an hour+
I have less than an hour
left on my battery+
I die either way+
Unless y ou get out
of her e soon, so do y ou+
Ar en't y ou
the Liberty Wallace of+++
Yes+
Any demands?
He wants+++
He wants somebody to pay
for the death of his daughter+
Joe: Almost right+
Joe's daughter, died+++
from a fucked up kid
with a gun+
It was a gun manuf actur ed
by my company+
He wants me to die,
knowing I have blood on my hands+
Bill:
Joe, y ou've got to r ethink her e+
This is crazy+
Ther e's a r eal gun
pointed at y ou+
What I mean is,
ther e ar e other way s,
Uh-huh+
That's wher e y ou
come in, Bill+
You want me to use
my influence as a journalist,
to debate the right
to bear arms with y ou,
because y ou've got
a gun pointed at me?
I'm standing next to a bomb
that's on final countdown+
Yeah+
What happens when
all this is over?
I blow my brains out+
Bill: This becomes my journalistic
moment of truth+
Your Emmy+
And y our quest+
I'm sorry, Joe+
What do y ou want me to say her e?
Liberty: Say y es+
No+ Say that y ou'r e
accountable+
Say y es+
Ther e ar e plenty
of causes, Joe+
Joe: Bill, look at Liberty+
She's going to die+
It's her choice when,
it's my choice how+
You have a similar dilemma+
Now,
look around+
( Liberty gasps )
Jesus, shit+
( Liberty scr eechs )
He shot me+
I'll do whatever
he wants+
Joe: He's going to die
in y our arms, Liberty+
Get r eady+
Watching someone die+++
changes y ou for ever+
19-86+++
to Dispatch+
We have a f emale with a gun+
I'm not dying+
Joe: His f ather is
Senator Robert Tollman+
He's also
a constitutional lawy er+
He lobbied for the NRA,
so we know which side
his br ead is butter ed on+
He's proud of his son+
And now like me,
has every r eason
to switch sides+
Hey+
( gurgling )
How many times
do I have to tell y ou?
Turn that fucking
thing off+
( crying )
Just hang on+
Help's coming+
No+ It's not+
- Camera man: Fucking asshole+
- Sue me+
Get him out of her e+
Can't buy this
kind of pr ess+
10:00 news, buddy+
Call my f ather for me+
( gurgling )
Why ar e y ou doing this?
Why?
Why ar e y ou doing this?
Liberty: Tell me+
Your dick is the size of
the little trigger on that gun+
That makes y ou
nothing, Joe+
You'r e less
than nothing+
You probably didn't
even have a daughter,
if y ou did,
she's better off dead+
I'll forgive y ou
for that,
given the cir cumstances+
( gunshot )
Just kill me+
- Liberty: Get it over with+
- Joe: Shut up+
I'm not the one shooting+
I can't take anymor e+
I'm going to hang up+
That asshole's shooting
with a +9 millimeter,
He hasn't got a hope
of hitting y ou from that distance+
Ah, Victor+
You have made my day+
Hello+
It's kind of ironic,
me saving y our lif e+
( sir ens )
They'r e her e+
( sir ens )
The officer went down
over ther e+
The lady with the bomb
is across the str eet+
It's time to do something+
Bill has a tape r ecor der,
in his suit pocket+
Name names,
Liberty+
Blow the lobbies wide open+
Pay off s ar e alway s
good news br eakers+
Liberty:
You'r e an amateur, Joe+
No+ No+ No+ Don't tell me that
y ou'r e worried about the f allout+
Your husband, or someone
he works for,
has or der ed the CIA thugs
to put a bullet in y ou+
Is that the world
y ou want to live in?
What do y ou think
y ou can accomplish
by me babbling about Senator-this
and Senator-that?
That's not going
to do anything+
It's a start+
It's an end, Joe+
Let me do what
I can r eally do+
Let me work
from the inside+
I can--
I can--
( sobs )
I can do something+
So that's what
y ou tell y ourself every morning?
Joe, I can r eally
change things+
I promise y ou
I'll do it+
I promise+
( gunshot )
Police+
Put them down+
Come on+
Come on+
We can alway s count on our nation's
finest to serve and protect+
Officer: Shots fir ed+ I've got
a civilian down possibly dead+
Looks like a shooter+
Senator Libby
took at least
thr ee payments in cash+
Senator Lipton, Crick,
Congr essmen Gomez+++
Check Geneva bank accounts,
Swiss Union bank accounts,
Cayman Islands, Bahamas+
My husband+
Liberty: Victor Wallace is fucking
the pr esident's wif e,
among others+
Pr esidents+++
or wives?
Humph+
Liberty:
What do y ou want me to do?
Nothing+
You'r e on a roll+
Keep it going+
Joe: You'r e alr eady
on the news+
Victor's mobilized
every senator I've just mentioned+
The police chief is
in his back pocket+
He supplies the gang that controls
this corner, for Christ's sake+
Joe: He?
Okay+ I+
We+
I+
I'm in this, okay?
Is that what y ou want me
to say, ""I'm in it""?
Yes+
Now, who ar e y ou
going to trust?
Nobody+
- Keep talking+
- No+
I'll name names,
I'll bury every one who deserves it,
but y ou have to shut
this bomb off+
Uhh+++ can't+
Liberty: Then I can't+
Joe: Fair enough+
You've done
y our job anyway+
Now we can depend
on Bill's dad, the senator,
and his newfound quest+
Joe: He'll go down
as a hero for the cause+
It was a lif e well spent+
In the big pictur e+
Have a hot dog+
You don't want to go out
on an empty stomach+
Let them take
him away+
Officer: Ma'am+
Come with me, ma'am+
Over her e+
Woman:
Every Thursday,
they meet backstage,
go into Russell's dr essing room,
and lock the door+
They or der in+
Bastar d changed
the lock+
Fuck+
Woman: Yeah, she slinks out
sometime during the night,
and we don't see Russell again
until the next performance+
Oh+ Ex cept for tonight+
He's probably in ther e,
fucked to death+
Uh-oh+
Time to call a locksmith+
Back up's coming in from 53+
Look's like we've got
ourselves a sniper+
Ther e's no I+D+
on the woman,
no trace on her cell phone y et+
If she's chained to the stand--
She told officers
ther e was a bomb, all right?
We believe she's working
with the sniper+
The man on the ground out ther e,
is a r eporter with KNBS+
Bill Tollman,
the senator's son+
We believe shot+
We have a confirmed f atality
in a parking structur e back her e+
We don't have enough
information on that y et,
but we can't rule out terrorists,
militia, or just a basic nutcase+
We'r e going to block
5th to 10th, Olive to Berry+
We've got at least 20 buildings
to evacuate+
We'r e thin on manpower+
Use uniforms to back y ou up+
All right?
Be saf e, gentlemen+ Let's go+
Swat member:
Captain+
We've got no location
on the shooter,
No I+D+ on the woman+
We've got backup coming in+
We'r e set up in the garage
back her e+
Somebody shut them down+
Jesus+
Clear the media back, please+
We ar e live+
The drama continues
in downtown LA,
wher e we appar ently have
a f atal shooting of an officer,
her e at the corner
of Grace and 9th+
Liberty: Is y our wif e going
to be tuning in?
( laughs )
No+
But I guarantee
y our husband's watching+
Back to y ou, Dennis+
( laughs )
My husband+
My husband's on the way
to the airport by now+
He will be unr eachable
for comment+
Why'd y ou marry him?
I thought he could save
my f ather's company+
It was a bad idea+
I even thought I loved him+
Should we do a shield r escue
for the guy on the ground?
No+ It's too risky until
we find out wher e the shooter is+
Poor bastar d's gonna
bleed out+
I want all traffic locked down
from 5th to 9th+
Yeah, that's done alr eady+
Who's the negotiator on call?
John's going to be her e
in 10 minutes, Captain+
Joe, mor e death isn't going
to make the guns disappear,
it's not going to bring
y our daughter back+
I'm begging y ou+
Oh+ Liberty+
Tiananmen Squar e
boiled down to one man,
standing in front of a tank,
that couldn't move or shoot+
Because human dignity
was stronger
than steel or bullets+
It changed a nation+
That was a completely
diff er ent situation+
Joe: What's the diff er ence?
We've got gated communities,
security sy stems, and kids
carrying combat weapons,
all because most people
haven't even
r ead the 2nd amendment+
So,
our fr eedom of speech,
is protected,
as long as we don't piss off
a guy with a gun+
Liberty: I'm not brave enough
to take a bullet for my country+
Joe:
You under estimate y ourself+
The one thing
that guarantees our fr eedom,
and independence,
is r esponsibility+
We lost that somewher e between
Vietnam and pr esidential blowjobs+
Joe: Many of the Fathers
of the Constitution+++
had slaves,
but they wrote a document,
about fr eedom+
Go figur e+
So y ou see,
things ar e meant to change+
We'r e all grown up now+
So ar e y ou, Liberty+
I think y ou've figur ed out
ther e's no such thing
as a politically corr ect gun+
I'll say all
that to the pr ess+
But please turn
this bomb off, Joe+
I don't know what to do next+
It f eels like
this whole thing was a dr eam+
I should have told
y ou befor e, but I+++
What do we do now?
Joe: Huh+
The cops have+++
G-36's+
Did y ou make that deal too?
It was mor e of a donation+
I'll bet that y ou wer e a hero+
We got a big luncheon,
key to the city,
may or in my pocket,
- You make it sound so easy+
- If y ou've got the cash flow,
a little planning
goes a long way+
Joe: Did they know
y ou had just sold 26 stripped down
P-99's that went
straight to the str eets?
I guess it was one of those
an-ey e-for-an-ey e deals+
It's easy to get lost
in a deal+
I know it's not an ex cuse+
This is a perf ect
fucking nightmar e+
127 locations
for an asshole with a gun+
We've got a cell phone
we can't bust into,
and a bomb next
to a theater+
Anybody picking up
in ther e y et?
- Just voicemail+
- Fucking voicemail+
Joe: Well+++
the shooter is back+
Who's he work for?
Your husband
or the CIA?
Liberty:
Whoever's got the cash+
( helicopter )
Who's the cowboy
in the chopper?
Get him higher,
he's surveillance+
I don't want him
landing on the fucking rooftop+
Okay, y ou guy s,
let's get in her e+
Let's get
into the theater+
I should have told y ou
befor e, but I+++
What do we do now?
It's up to y ou+
Do y ou still love me?
Of course I do+
How about y ou?
Of course+
It won't make
a bit of diff er ence+
( clapping )
How full is the theater?
It's the last performance+
( clapping )
I figur e 10
to clear the building,
Officer: Copy that+
No one exits the front door+
Hold until we've clear ed
all r ear exits+
( sir ens )
Senator Tollman's son
was just shot,
by the same guy
who's got Liberty+
I'm calling y our husband+
Why?
( cell phone rings )
Yeah+
Who called the militia?
I want to talk
to Liberty+
Touching+
It's not one of y ours?
That's not good,
Victor+
Liberty ar e y ou ther e?
Such a sweet name,
don't y ou think?
Her par ents
wer e Republican+
I want to talk
to my wif e+
I'm her e+
Alive+
And on TV+
I+++ uh+++
I know, y ou'r e doing
what y ou have to do+
You know who's calling
the shots?
The pr esident's wif e?
Come on+
Liberty: No, of course not+
If it wer e, y ou'd be standing her e+
I'm doing what I can, but+++
You know the rules, right?
Aw, honey,
fuck y ou+
Liberty:
Joe, hang up+
No, what she meant is,
why don't y ou let her die
with some dignity?
Get the car+
- Mr+ Wallace is leaving+
- Yes, sir+
Man: Right through her e+
Right this way+
Through her e+
Liberty: How do y ou know Victor?
Classified+
Keep moving this way+
Come on, let's go!
- Copy that+
- Who the fuck is she?
We just I+D+'d her,
Liberty Wallace+++
the VP of McCloud,
married to the CEO,
connections up the wazoo+
Jesus Christ+
I know him+ Victor+
Yeah, we'r e trying
to track him down right now+
Then ther e's no way she's
with the shooter, she's a hostage+
So I'm bait+
No, mor e like--
mor e like a showpiece+
I like y our r eckless side+
You travel without y our body guar d,
five hours every
week and sometimes twice+
You'r e a little bit mor e
accessible and pr edictable
than the pr esident's wif e+
So, who's pissed off
at Victor, the pr esident?
( sighs )
No+
It's all me this time+
I was a dad+
I'm not anymor e+
Somebody's pulling y our string+
Who is it?
No one+
Not now+
Never thought my skills from
my former lif e would ever pay off+
CIA?
Well+++
that too+
Come on,
if I'm gonna die
I have the right to know
my assassin a little better+
( sighs )
I worked covert--
covert operations for the CIA+
I was in China
during Tiananmen Squar e,
Cuba, Panama,
and I was in Columbia+++
when my daughter was killed+
( police radio chatter )
This is Captain Hank Wilfor d+
Could y ou tell us
what this is about?
I don't want any one else to die
because they'r e talking to me+
So, what's it gonna be?
Huh-uh-uh+
It's y our show, baby+
Just leave me out of this for now+
Liberty: Ther e's a bomb
in the hot dog cart!
It's set to blow
when my cell phone dies+
In about 15 minutes+
I'm chained to the cart+
What ar e the demands?
A public debate
of the 2nd amendment+
- Hmm+++
- Liberty: Hear d of it?
Go, girl+
I'd like to understand,
ar e ther e any other demands?
Can I come closer?
Any other demands?
No+
No!
Liberty,
I will kill any one who comes close+
We have no confirmation y et,
but it appears that
KNBS r eporter, Bill Tollman
has been seriously hurt+
And that Liberty Wallace
of McCloud Guns
is demanding a public debate
about the constitution,
and its role
in our violent times+
She's grandstanding,
got to be militia+
Sir+
Yeah+
Yes, sir+
Yes, sir, Liberty Wallace+
You wer e good
under the pr essur e+
And the whole world
will applaud y ou+
Or laugh at me+
The pr ess is the least
of my concerns at this point+
I'll try to move them back, but+++
Yes, sir+
I'll move them back right away+
Thank y ou, sir+
Get rid of the pr ess+
Tell them it's a saf ety issue+
Uptown doesn't want this thing
under a microscope+
They'r e gonna make a move, Joe+
They'll never disarm that bomb+
They probably alr eady guessed that+
You won't be alone
in the final moment+
( sighs )
Status on the theater?
Somebody welded
all the side exits shut+
We've got an
entering team coming in,
- but the fir e department--
- Is stuck in traffic+
- All exits?
- Yeah, our cutters won't work+
The only exit is onto the str eet,
and through the front door+
So in eff ect they'r e hostages+
Tell me about
y our daughter again+
( sighs )
A boy at school
put a gun to her head,
and asked her
if she believed in God+
What did she say?
I don't know+
Liberty's voice:
What did she say?
Joe's voice:
I don't know+
Is that robot r eady to go?
Officer:
It'll be her e in 15+
Wilfor d:
What about the bomb truck?
We've got one coming in from the 48+
ETA-- 30 minutes+
General evacuation?
We've got a full r etr eat going+
We'll find this son of a bitch+
It'll just take a little time+
Tell me about y our f ather+
My f ather+++
He was my hero+
( sniffles )
He was+
After he+++
y ou know+++
I had to leave school
to earn a living+
One thing led to the next+
I found my self working
in the f amily business
that was no longer f amily-owned+
Captain, I've only got 10 guy s+
We should be fine
once the 53 squad shows up+
That should be another
10 or 12 minutes+
We'r e not gonna make it+
Liberty: It's all I knew+
Along came Victor,
he was brilliant, thought he could
save my f ather's company+
Our first big deal
was with the Saudis+
But the Iraqis wer e shooting
us with our own guns+
What do people think the government
does with all those used weapons?
Melt them down?
Make little sculptur es out of them?
Once we took the company
international,
suddenly we wer e
in a diff er ent league+
It got complicated+
Her e I am+
And Russell made y ou f eel
human again+
Liberty:
And anonymous+
You know,
my gr eat-gr eat-grandf ather,
he designed the gun that changed
the outcome of the Civil War+
( chuckles )
I gr ew up thinking that's
what we wer e still doing+
( chattering )
Officer:
We ar e securing the building+
( officer speaking Spanish )
I'm r eally sorry
about y our daughter+
Liberty: Joe+++
One less br eathing
to help us tell our story+
We've got the shooter
on the roof of a building at 8+
Victor: I don't car e
if it looks like the Russians,
or the Pakistanis,
or the Girl Scouts,
that guy's voice is American+
This is an internal thing,
get on it+
I want to know who the fuck else
is shooting at my wif e+
( phone beeps )
Yeah+
Joe:
Wher e ar e y ou going?
Why?
( chuckles )
The ber eaved husband+
Victor: When ar e y ou gonna
stop scr ewing around
and tell me what this
is all about?
You'r e doing it by the book:
go on a business trip:
be unavailable for comment:
touch down in Washington
for a little f ace time
with the client:
check the temperatur e+
I don't r eally have a whole lot
of choice, now do I?
Joe+++
We know each other don't we?
Victor:
Don't we?
You do any time
in South America?
Well, who didn't?
Victor: None of us
r eally came through that
with our mental health intact,
did we?
God knows,
it took me a while
to pull my shit together
when I got back+
Yeah+++
Yeah,
it's a mental health thing+
You talk like a company man+
Or at least, well,
y ou wer e a company man,
because they'd never go for
this kind of theatrical bullshit+
What is y our beef with me?
That y ou'd run away
and let them take Liberty+
That y ou'r e not man enough
to stand up for y our wif e+
Hope y ou'r e impr essed
with y our lif e+
Grace and 9th+
- Sur e about that, sir?
- Grace and 9th!
You've got it+
- Officer: Shooter's still out her e+
- Wilfor d: Shit, take cover f ast+
The sniper is shooting
at our guy s on the ground+
How many down?
No r eport y et+
Over headset:
Luke, it's Mac+ We have the shooter+
We've got the guy on the roof+
Nobody moves until we get
mor e information+ Understood?
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lor d is with thee,
blessed art thou amongst women,
blessed is the fruit
of thy womb Jesus+++
Mac: Looks like
we've got a problem up her e+
It's not the sniper+
Well, who the fuck is he?
Why is he shooting?
No r eport y et+
+++pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death+
Amen+
Chuck say s he's talking
the gold star clearance+
CIA?
Jesus, get him down her e
if he's still br eathing+
Joe,
what is enough?
Ar e y ou begging for lives?
Yes+
Wher e ar e the shots coming from?
My guy s ar e thinking the brick,
maybe the concr ete+
I'm thinking higher than the--
Way too much information+
Status on backup?
Woman: It's probably a hoax+
I think it has something
to do with her husband+
Russell's been playing with fir e+
Now, don't be jealous, dear+
Woman:
Oh, fuck off+
Victor knew y our voice+
Is this some kind of setup?
Come on, now think har d
and y ou'll get it all figur ed out+
What the fuck do y ou mean, think?
Liberty:
Come on, come clean+
You've taken my lif e,
y ou owe me that much+
If I'm CIA or FBI,
then I went through all of this
because someone very high up
wants a lot of visibility+
Liberty: Okay, okay,
it was a stupid thought+
Look, y ou can't write this off
to be some big conspiracy+
That's gonna confuse
the fuck out of all of them+
Think+ Think about how
y ou'r e doing on the scor eboar d+
It's not like I woke up
one day and said,
""Wow, it's gr eat to be
in the lethal weapons business+""
It's like the guy on the corner
who sells newspapers,
it's what I do+
- What else am I gonna do?
- Be the boss!
It's y our lif e, isn't it?
If the idea was
for me to see God,
y ou've achieved it+
I mean, I pray ed, for Christ's sake+
To the parking garage+
Let's assemble in ther e+ Let's go!
When my daughter was killed,
my wif e came apart+
We met the par ents
of the kid who did it+
His f ather+++
cried+
And he told us that
he had taught his son
how to use a gun saf ely+
Never saw it coming+
I wanted to kill that kid+
Then I wanted to kill the f ather+
But+++
her e I am instead+
I like y ou+
This is no way to die+
For us ther e's
no other way out+
I thought about this
for a long time+
Bomb squad wants us
to move further back+
Captain, it's Victor Wallace
on the line+
Nobody move+
Victor, Hank her e+
Hank?
Jesus Christ+
Hank:
Do y ou know what this is about?
I was hoping y ou'd tell me+
I don't believe y ou+
We found a guy on the roof
shooting at her+ He looked CIA+
- Did y ou get him?
- No, somebody else shot him+
The guy we've got is not the sniper
or maybe he's one of them+
My ass is
hanging out her e, Victor+
I need y ou to tell me
what's going on+
What's going on?
We'r e dealing with a nutcase+
That's what's going on+
Yeah, or terrorists buying time+
It's only been half an hour
and the pr ess is still stacking up+
I'm five minutes away+
This action may be connected
to the r ecent lawsuit
filed by seven
of the largest gunmakers,
alleging that efforts
by government to impose
gun saf ety measur es,
amounts to a conspiracy
that violates constitutional
guarantees of fr ee trade+
Wallace's company, McCloud Guns,
is at the center of this controversy
by r efusing to become signatory
to any government proposal
that legislates mor e controls+
Man:
Thanks for that br eaking news+
Now on the international--
31 cities and countries
have brought charges against
manuf actur ers claiming
they'r e not doing enough
to keep guns out of the
hands of childr en and criminals+
Appar ently, Wallace is
staging a high-stakes protest
against the very industry
that made her f amily
f amous in America+
Back to y ou, Dennis+
We'r e in the final str etch, Liberty+
So,
what's y our plan?
I don't want to die+
I don't want to die+
I don't want any one else
to die because of me, Joe+
Me neither+
You know,
the NRA is just gonna
spin this and say it's because
of people like y ou
that we need to be armed+
Well, I was an honest
law-abiding citizen+
By that definition
I deserve to be armed+
And I was acting
out against the oppr ession
of our fr eedom+
Ther e it is+
( car horns honking:
helicopters overhead )
Joe: You know,
I first saw y ou in Jerusalem+
About thr ee y ears ago+
You must have made
a hell of a deal+
'Cause they wer e
kissing y our ass+
- Did I meet y ou?
- Nope+
I did business
with Victor, though+
On behalf of the Saudis+
It seems he likes
to sell on all sides+
We met in our early day s+
Seriously flawed
mission to Columbia+
I saved his lif e+
( chuckles )
How funny+
I saved the lif e of the man
that killed my daughter+
Joe+++
( car horn blar es )
Thanks, Barry+
I don't f eel good about this+
( deep exhale )
Death isn't as ex citing
as I thought it would be+
Ex cuse me, please+
Ex cuse me+
Ex cuse me,
I'm Victor Wallace+
Sir, y ou can't
come through her e+
I'm the husband,
y ou fucking moron+
Woman:
Sir, just one question!
Don't talk to me+
Woman: Has this play ed
into McCloud's position
on gun saf ety legislation?
This has absolutely nothing to do
with McCloud Industries+
These ar e the actions
of an insane man+
And my wif e
is a wonderful woman+
She's a wonderful woman+
- Victor, y ou can't go out ther e+
- I just want to let her see me+
Why?
'Cause I think I know
who this guy is+
And I think I can
get her out of this+
Whatever y ou'r e thinking,
- I can't let--
- This is my problem+
Don't make me
make problems for y ou+
Be good to the car+
I said the car+
Liberty !
Victor+
( cell phone rings )
Hey, Alex+
Well, her e we ar e again,
in the kill zone+
What can I do for y ou?
I r emember the day
y ou wept like a baby
while I promised
not to let y ou die+
Okay, okay,
y ou saved my lif e, y eah+
Wasn't I thankful enough then?
Well, thanks again+
I mean it+
- Victor+++
- But I have a f eeling that+++
what's r eally expected of me
is some sort of big,
public conf ession+
Am I right?
What am I supposed to say?
Joe, don't do it+
That--
that r eally shiny one
that I have is actually for--
for leading a bunch
of men to their death?
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?
Come on+
Alex, it's a war+
That's the kind of stuff
that happens+
You think I'm proud of it?
I didn't ask for the medal+
Your death is gonna
mean something+
But my daughter's+++
won't+
Joe, don't do it+
Liberty:
Don't do it!
- Liberty: Don't!
- Christ, he's been hit+
Officer:
Get him out of her e!
Get him inside f ast!
Come on, pick him up!
Move!
Let's go! Let's go!
( sighs )
( explosion )
( scr eaming )
Liberty:
Don't!
Joe: Liberty+++
Liberty !
- It's time+
- What?
Time for y ou to go+
The key s for y our cuff s
is in a box taped to the underside
of the cart near the corner+
Okay, guy s, it's got to be this one
right her e, 7th and Alvarado+
Move on it!
7th and Alvarado!
( sir ens wailing )
Aah!
Bring the chopper
into the back,
or this guy will
blow it out of the sky+
Must be some kind of shooter
if he's holed up that f ar+
In the theater,
officer needs backup+
Ther e's people panicking+
Smoke everywher e+
A fir e's been set
or something+
Hey !

Ther e's a bomb!
Guy s, all ey es out

Run! Run!
Ther e's a bomb!

( scr eams )
Joe: Liberty,

Time to choose+
( sir ens wailing )
Officer: Everybody, move!
Computer:

Senator Libby took at least

Wilfor d: You'll all be able

Wher e's Russell?
- Wher e's Russell?

Liberty:

Get out of her e!
Don't!
Get out of her e!
Ther e's a bomb!
Get out! Run!
Get out of her e!
( exhales )
( deep sigh )
Computer: The file with the video

( sir ens wailing )
As y ou can see,

The situation is under control+
Now, if y ou'll ex cuse me+
All right,

All right, get the fir e hose+
Find that motherfucker !
No, sir+
No other civilian casualties

We've had a fir e r eported

No damage+ No casualties+
All noise and smoke+
He made me shoot it+
Close range+
- Who ar e y ou?
- I was looking for my wif e's purse+
It's not saf e in her e+
Get out of her e+
Liberty's voice:
My gr eat-gr eat-grandf ather,
he designed the gun that changed
the outcome of the Civil War+
( Liberty chuckles )
( sir ens wail )
Wher e exactly wer e y ou when
the first explosion took place?
Umm+++ that's funny
that y ou would ask+
Ex cuse me+
Mr+ Perry ! Mr+ Perry !
Liberty's voice: I gr ew up thinking
that's what we wer e still doing+
Officer:
On the other side!
I'm r eally sorry
about y our daughter+
My f ather+++
he was my hero+
( sniffles )
He was+
( sighs )
Liberty's voice:
Let me do what I can r eally do+
Let me work from the inside+
I can--
I can do something+
Joe,
I can r eally change things+
I promise y ou I'll do it+
I promise+
