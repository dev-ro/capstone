They were broke up,
but suddenly
That girl, she came back,
and found him
That one with beard, start over again
But, she has promised
to marry that guy with no beard
So, he didn't agree of course
Now, they all are here to discuss...
straight thing out, to have a result...
Okay, l got it,
this is a complicated love affair
Yes...you are very clever
According to his boss
Your dad worked in the evidence room
for 20 years
He was a very reliable person
This time he stole the money,
just an act of greed
Even he had been caught,
only if he can return the money
The court will punish him lightly
Didn't you say that you can find him?
He doesn't show for one day
Nobody will let...
go of you and your father
We can arrange you go back to HK...
for protection
3 months ago, my dad called me
He said he will come here
He wanted to visit my mom's grave
on her memorial day
When is your mom's memorial day?
June 20, tomorrow,
Boss, the car was found,
l got the registration info
Okay, we are ready to go
Do you think
they can negotiate peacefully?
Or, will they fight without settlement
lf it was that hard to choice
They might kill each other or
suicide together
Did you think your friend
The one with beard, he looks awful
What did he do anyway?
Police
l knew it, he is a cop, looking bad
But l think
he looks like a corrupted cop
He will beat the criminals
Shut up,
he is my idol
Why did you so mean?
Where will we sleep tonight?
Whatever
How come...
you always said ''whatever''?
Do you like me to decide everything?
Of course not
Man can make decision...
is the man with power
More power will attract more women
l like you always like this
''Whatever'' and no power,
so, l don't have to worry
Your take out
So you think l will be no power forever?
Where the hell do we sleep tonight?
Don't hit my face, anywhere will do,
but not my face
Who borrow your car? Tell me

Too tired, slept already
She likes you, it's good
We have no time, if you want her,
do it tonight
Sir, if her father return

How about...
Let go of this girl?
What did you said? Are you crazy?
We just want money,
we can close the case
lf they don't die,
can we take the money safely
She is pretty, so you won't do it, right
She is innocent
lnnocent? So what?
You were with me for so long,
l have told you many times
Don't be emotional,
you are playing a game of guns
You can never soft-hearted
lf a person want to kill you,
will he think you are innocent?
My share of money, you just take it
Damn it, you don't want it,
l won't be happy
Come on, don't think too much
Heaven gave us...
this great chance
You don't take it, you will get bad luck
Let me tell you,
we will hide the money then
Back to HK empty handed
Just playing ''dead dog'',
and tell the boss, ''Sorry Sir''
We get 30 million,
