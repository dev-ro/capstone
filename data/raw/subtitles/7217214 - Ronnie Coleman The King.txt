...with a flashlight.
You can see that she's
on the way to her house.
There's also gonna be
a retired officer.
Both have a weapon
at her location. A 9mm.
Twenty-five, uh...
Got hit by a teenage daughter.
The daughter is gonna be
a white female.
The daughter...
Oh, man...
Everyday thing.
I've been working here for 12 years now.
The best thing about working this job...
is being able to wear shorts.
Let's go to work, do a briefing.
Only schedule change is, uh...
Steve Smith's gonna take
five hours of vacation today.
This is meal number...
three.
That's chicken and baked potato.
And so I grabbed my son by the arm
and said "go on back inside."
Well, she lost it, and got a hold of me.
Good ol' chicken.
Damn.
Claims the daughter has assaulted her
in the stomach area with a fist.
At this time,
the daughter is in the bedroom,
does not have any vehicle,
might attempt to leave location.
What seems to be the problem here?
Where's Mom?
She hit her
on her foot and it's swollen.
Well, she'll be lucky
if she just got hit on the foot.
I wish I would've just got hit
on the foot when I was a kid.
I got hit all over.
She got hit
all over her legs and her arms.
If I hit my mom back, I'd be dead.
- Why are you crying?
- I don't know.
Arrested.
I've been bodybuilding for...
ten years.
And I've been working here for 12.
And the famous question is...
"Why do you still work here...
and you're Mr. Olympia,
two-time Mr. Olympia?"
My answer to that question is...
"Because I love it."
Doctor said he's gonna go in
and perform a surgery
in which he's gonna take out the screws,
'cause all they're doing now
is just causing me pain,
and when I say pain,
it's a lot of pain.
It's, like, 24/7. It never stops.
After a while,
you've been in pain so much
you kind of get used to it,
and you just kind of
learn to block it out.
I feel bad for people
who didn't get to witness
what Ronnie was in his prime.
Videos and pictures
don't do no justice.
To witness it, to, you know,
feel the electricity in the air,
just to gaze your eyes on that person.
Late '90s, you know,
the guys that were there were so good.
You had the Kevin Levrones,
you had the Flex Wheeler,
Shawn Ray.
I mean, if you change the judging panel,
Kevin Levrone could have
a Mr. Olympia title.
Same could Flex.
What I didn't have, Flex Wheeler had.
What Flex Wheeler didn't have,
Shawn Ray had.
You know, it ran deep.
You know, you had Chris Cormier.
Everyone was so good, you know?
Everyone was hungry.
We were all aggressive,
especially, like, on stage.
You don't find someone
stepping in front of someone
without getting an elbow
or something like that.
You know, it was just...
it was pretty aggressive.
There was no room
for anybody else to get in.
You know? So you had to be
just another crazy level.
And you need to
be able to see those things
in order to be able to appreciate
what the hell happened
when Ronnie Coleman
pulled out of the backdrop and just...
Just wasn't human...
To just, naturally, to even perceive
what he looked like at his...
at his peak, and at his best.
This guy, Ronnie Coleman,
looked like an alien.
There was nobody that
you could compare that to.
Nobody had that.
Meat was just hanging off of his back,
and it was just traps...
...and lats that were forever long.
Pec line that was just,
you know, these muscle attachments
that would go on forever, seemingly.
Ronnie Coleman had things
on his body that we hadn't seen
on another Mr. Olympia prior to him,
and you probably won't see it
on another Mr. Olympia after him.
Ronnie just had it all, man.
He was strong, he was big,
he was bigger than everyone,
he was more conditioned than everyone...
And he just didn't give a shit.
Like, he stood up there on that stage,
and just was like, "I'm here.
Give me my Sandow,
and I'm leaving with it."
That was it.
You had to admire that.
And he was humble about it.
He wasn't cocky, he wasn't arrogant.
He knew it was his,
and he came and took it.
All right, so I want
to ask you about your childhood.
Can you tell me about
your family growing up?
- I know you were born in Louisiana, right?
- Mm-hmm.
Can you tell me a little
about your upbringing?
First, it was just me and my brother,
and, uh, my mom...
She worked at the plant.
It was a clothing manufacturing plant.
I can remember when I was young,
my mom, she was real good
at making clothes, too,
so she made a lot of our clothes,
and a lot of our clothes she got
from that manufacturing plant.
On her second marriage,
I remember the guy she was
married to this time, you know, uh...
He used to take me hunting all the time.
We used to hunt, like,
deer, and rabbit, and squirrel,
all kind of stuff,
and, yeah, that was a lot of fun,
but I think the most fun
I ever had was fishing.
He taught me how to fish,
and we'd go fishing all the time.
After a while,
fishing kind of developed into a hobby.
I got to the point where I was just going,
like, every single day.
I had a bike that I would just ride
right down to the local bayou
and just fish all the time,
so that kind of developed
into a small hobby.
I always had some kind of way
of making money.
That's what I remember most
about my childhood.
Man, I had to be, like,
12 years old, 13 years old,
somewhere in there.
I started working
at this convenience store...
and I would go up there and work,
make probably like a dollar a day.
Back then,
that was a lot of money.
And then I had another little hustle...
where I used to go, and, uh...
I had a lawnmower. I used to knock
on people's doors, and, you know,
ask who needed their yard mowed,
so I made money that way.
When I was in high school,
I was always making
the honor roll every year
and every semester.
I played football,
I was on the track team,
and I was on the powerlifting team.
I used to do the field events,
the shot put and discus,
javelin, stuff like that.
I always did pretty good
in all those events.
I always got, you know, first or second
in just about all the meets we went to.
This is my trophy case.
I don't know if you saw it
when we first came in.
I noticed it when I walked in.
Yeah, that's the Arnold Classic
trophy right there.
I won that "Most Muscular" thing, too.
Mm-hmm, I won two...
I won that twice. I got two of those.
The other one is somewhere in there.
Yeah, all the Sandows are up there.
If you had to pick the most special year.
- The first one, easy.
- First one?
Yeah, 'cause Flex
was supposed to win that.
Like I said, I got ninth the year before.
So I was nowhere, you know,
in the running for that.
So I was like,
"If I can finally make the top five,
I'll be one happy camper."
I'd never made the top five
in the Olympia.
- Never made...
- You went from ninth to the first.
Ninth to first, yeah.
I started powerlifting
when I was in high school.
You know, we traveled all over the state,
did meets and stuff.
- And I wasn't that good, you know.
- Wasn't that good?
No.
No, I wasn't good at all.
But, you know, I was...
Those guys was...
they were strong.
They were squatting 500 and 600 pounds
in high school, yeah.
I remember one time
I saw this little bitty guy,
he was about this tall.
He was getting on the 500, I'm like,
"No way he gonna squat that."
Man, he got on there
and squatted like it wasn't...
like it was like 200 pounds.
He went down.
I'm like, "That did not happen.
I did not just see that."
He...
He had to be about 15,
16 years old, something like that.
And he was short.
Blew my mind.
I can still see it today.
Back then, I could only do,
like, 400, you know?
Three, four-hundred.
Three-fifty, four-hundred
It took me a long time
to squat 800 pounds.
I used to squat, I mean... 700,
you know, and 750, like...
when I was in my early thirties.
But when I got to almost 40
is when I got to 800.
It takes time, I mean,
no matter what you do...
and I was working out hard, too,
you know?
- Consistently.
- Consistently.
Yeah, so no matter...
You can't speed up the genetics,
you know, process.
It takes time.
Ronnie Coleman is a story
that lore is made of.
This is a guy that lifted weights
that nobody else could lift.
'Cause even Arnold Schwarzenegger
in Pumping Iron with Lou Ferrigno,
it looked like they were throwing
around a lot of weight in the '70s.
Like, wow, you know?
Here's Lou Ferrigno saying,
"Put on another ten pounds."
But, I mean,
Ronnie Coleman doesn't even warm up
with the weights that
Lou Ferrigno was lifting,
and he's 6'5", 280 pounds.
Ronnie was lifting weights
that were at the far end
of the rack that were dusty,
things that nobody would even
fathom picking up,
and he was doing it with relative ease,
with repetitions.
I wanted to work out with Ronnie.
I wanted to see how intense
the champion's work ethic was.
But, yeah, you felt like
you'd been in a physical fight
after that workout.
When I went to the gym,
you know, I'd lift hard,
I'd lift heavy.
I'd get in there, and I wouldn't stay
in the gym no longer than an hour,
and the whole time
I was there, you know,
I was focused, and I think,
for the most part,
I worked a lot of those guys, you know?
Like I say, I trained six days a week.
You know, I only took one day off.
I trained Monday through Saturday.
You know, working full-time
for the police department,
I didn't have enough time to,
you know, like,
break my training up,
and train a body part here
and train a body part there,
and stuff like that
like some of the guys would do
that didn't have jobs.
So I'd get all my training in
in one session.
If you can't go in a gym
and train like Ronnie Coleman,
you don't have a chance
of looking like him.
So, without having
the fear of the weights,
and you see this guy throwing
this kind of weight around,
you couldn't help but press rewind,
and watch it again
and again and again.
Suddenly, you're not even caring
that he's a freak of nature
in terms of a bodybuilder,
you're just looking
at this freak lift this weight.
You know,
his mindset is just at another level.
The things he'd do in videos
with that amount of weight,
it's not normal strength.
It's a gift from God, number one,
that he has.
He's gifted with genetics.
If you're a strong bodybuilder,
you have
the propensity to put on more weight.
The taller you are,
the bigger you're gonna be.
They can eat, and they can outlift you,
and the only thing that
we would have to rely on was our genetics.
Flex Wheeler was...
You can't say Flex
without saying symmetry, or genetics.
And that's what made me who I was.
I think Flex had
the best genetics in the world,
but I kind of outworked him.
You know what?
Hey, listen, sometimes, you know,
they joke,
and they say about me, you know,
"When God made you, He broke the mold."
Well, when He made Ronnie,
He broke that mold, too.
He was just a freak.
Hey, Erica, how you doin'?
Can I get you to give me a hand?
Got ya.
You want me to drive your car?
You want to drive my car?
- Got you.
- Thanks a lot, Erica.
- You have a good one.
- You too.
We'll see you tomorrow.
One thing I want to stress about Ronnie
which really annoys me...
People sometimes think,
because of his Louisiana drawl,
you know, he's not very well educated,
he's not...
maybe he's not that smart.
He's as smart as a whip,
and he knows exactly what he's doing.
You never ask him a question
with him, "I don't know."
You know, he knows what he's doing
and why he's doing it.
You know, when I was in football,
I kind of, like, walked on to the team
and made the team,
and worked my way up to first string.
I started out, you know, in fifth string,
and worked my way
all the way up to first.
I've always tried to be the very best
at whatever it is
that I've always done.
When I was in college, I always tried
to be the smartest guy in the class,
and if I wasn't, then I would study
with the smartest guy, but...
nine times out of ten I was.
I started out in management,
and then I stumbled upon
accounting, and I...
I was really good at it.
You know, I was doing...
I was making hundreds
on each and every test that I took.
And one of my instructors said,
"What are you majoring in?"
and I'm like, "Management,"
he's like, "No, dude,
you need to change that to accounting
'cause you're, like,
acing every test that you go through."
He said, "And I think accounting would be
more lucrative than management."
So I'm like, "Okay."
Hey, Corey, you ready, man?
This ain't no joke.
You gotta get that back bigger, baby.
Yeah, buddy!
Gotta dig deep! Come on, yeah!
So after you retired professionally,
you started a business,
your own supplement line.
Tell me about that.
Every year,
the company has grown,
and got bigger, and bigger, and bigger.
And we're on our sixth year now.
We launched in Europe and...
the Middle East, uh, India.
Did pretty good,
and then, like, two years later,
we launched it here in the U.S.
And we got to the point where we...
started with two products,
you know, the first couple years,
then we worked our way up to, like, four,
then six, and then eight.
You know, now,
we are branching out to...
we got, like, almost 20 products now.
We started out doing, like,
four million the first year,
six million the year after that,
then eight million, then ten, you know.
And then 12, and then 15.
So, getting bigger and better
every single year.
Just growing it, and, you know,
just seeing how far we can take it.
I got it.
- What's going on with you?
- Not much.
- You doing all right?
- Yeah.
Man, you know,
I ran out of the stuff again.
I'm always running out.
Yeah, what do you need today?
You have peanut butter, uh...
King Whey?
Oh, you got a big one over there, huh?
- That's all I got.
- That's all you got?
Yeah. Go big or go home, Ronnie.
How many you got over there?
Got enough. I've got three.
- You got three?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I don't want to take
your last one, you know.
- Yo.
- Hey, man.
You talk to what's his name?
So, yeah. I'm emailing James right now,
and then I copied you on the email, too.
Hey, about that shot?
What about that shot
you was talking about?
- The Yeah Buddy shot?
- Yeah.
It's not...
We're having a problem
with one of the ingredients.
- That one's not gonna...
- Ah, ain't that a bitch.
Yeah, but, right now,
we're having a very good month.
- Yeah. Oh, cool.
- Just gonna bill this shit and get it out.
Oh, cool, that'll work.
That'll work, that'll work.
We need a damn good month.
- All right.
- All right, dude.
- All right, bye, later.
- Later.
When I got out of college,
I started looking for jobs in accounting,
and most of the jobs
I went on interviews,
they all required you to have
some kind of experience.
And, you know,
since I never worked anywhere,
I never got a co-op job
or nothing like that
while I was in college,
I didn't have no experience,
so I missed out on a lot of hiring.
So, I just took pretty much
the first thing that came along.
The first thing that came along
was Domino's Pizza.
I didn't like pizza after a while,
workin' for Domino's for two years.
I remember, when I worked for Domino's,
I was so poor I looked forward
to going to work so I can eat,
'cause pizza was free
and I ate it every single day.
And after a while, you know,
about a year or so into it,
you know, I'm like,
"Man, I'm tired of eating pizza."
But Burger King was right next door to us,
and I'm like, "I wonder
if they're tired of eating hamburgers."
So I called them.
"Hey, y'all tired of eating burgers?"
They're like, "Yeah."
"Y'all wanna trade?"
They're like,
"Yeah, we want to eat pizza."
So I would trade pizza for hamburgers.
Then, afterwards,
I got tired of eating hamburgers,
Kentucky Fried Chicken
was right next door to them.
So I called them up, like,
"Hey, y'all tired of eating chicken?"
They're like, "Yeah."
"Y'all want to trade?"
But, you know, the whole time I was there
I was looking for jobs in accounting.
I went on a lot of interviews, you know,
but like I said,
everybody was still saying
I need experience and stuff, and...
And I'm about two years into this,
and I'm like,
"Man, I don't think it's gonna work out."
And I noticed that...
every time I got the newspaper,
in the classified section
there was always a big ol' ad there
for police officers,
and they all said,
"No experience needed."
So, when I went to Arlington, uh...
I had taken, like, two tests already,
so I kind of, like, got to Arlington
and kind of like breezed
through the process,
but it was a long process.
Biggest thing was
the background check, you know?
You had these officers,
like, two or three guys going,
talking to everybody
that you talked to over the years.
I still kind of, like, breezed through it
'cause I never was in no kind of trouble.
I always got along with people,
and never did any kind
of drugs or nothing,
so I kind of breezed through it
because, you know,
I had a real clean record, you know?
I was always trying to be the best,
and my first year, you know,
I was able to get rookie of the year
because I worked so hard,
and, you know...
And tried to be the very best
that I could at it,
and I was able to get that award.
Girls, take a break.
Daddy needs to record something.
Turn the water off.
- Yippee!
- Okay, go outside.
Oh, Lord. That's so small.
- I know.
- Do you want to stand, or...
Yeah, I'll stand.
For me, he's perfect
'cause he does what he wants to do
and I do what I want to do,
and at the end of the day,
together, we come home,
and we all, you know,
have family time,
and we don't get in each other's way.
At the same time, we work together.
Okay, can you read it from here?
Yeah, yeah. I see it.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Hey, guys. Big Ron here.
Just want to let you guys know...
We met at his show,
the Ronnie Coleman Classic.
A friend knew him, and said,
"can meet up with him afterwards."
A big group of us,
all together afterwards,
and we all ended up staying till...
up till 5:00 a.m., talking.
Yup. And at the end,
we exchanged phone numbers.
Mm-hmm.
Let's all make some gains together.
Yeah, buddy.
No.
- Try again.
- Okay.
Follow the link below
to check out our official website.
Let's all make some gains together.
Yeah, buddy.
Hold on, let me see this.
You going, "Oh, man."
Oh, wow. Where's my keys for my car?
I've always been real fond of kids,
when I was in high school and college.
Had my first one in college.
I got my 32, and 33-year-old.
You know, my 32 is in Houston.
Actually,
I have a granddaughter, too, with her.
And Susan has two kids, uh...
15 and 13.
And then me and Susan
have the four together here.
- Who's that?
- Sophie, mami.
She's a little "ah!"
Sophie, give me kiss, kiss, kiss?
Mwah! Thank you.
Huh?
Laila!
Hey, girl! How you doin'?
You doin' all right?
Can I have a kiss? Dada get a kiss?
Mwah! Thank you!
- Ready to go?
- Ready! Ready!
You okay, Sophie?
You all right, mami? What happened?
- Did you hit your shoulder?
- She bumped her head.
She bumped her head?
Yeah.
What are you looking at, Laila?
- Daddy!
- Yeah?
- Over here.
- What's over here?
- Car!
- Yup.
Laila, didn't you have
a jacket on this morning?
Laila?
Laila, where's your jacket?
Did you have a jacket on this morning?
- No.
- You didn't? Are you sure?
No.
I think you did have one on.
Yeah, we got four together.
So we got a three-year-old.
She's adorable.
They're not... She's not into any sports
or anything right now.
She's doing her own thing.
The four-year-old, same thing,
she's not into any sports or anything.
Just doing the kid thing.
And I'm not trying to rush 'em.
- A-ha! Did I scare you?
- Daddy.
Daddy! I scared ya?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Give me kiss.
Mwah! Thank you!
For the most part, I pick up the, uh...
three and four-year-old
every single day from school.
- Laila, you're blowing the horn, mami.
- Daddy.
Daddy, where is it?
- In the sink.
- In the sink.
Mm-hmm.
Daddy, can we take this off?
Mm-hmm.
You want to take it off?
Yes, Daddy.
Okay, hold on.
Aw! Daddy!
- Hmm?
- I want to take it off.
Man, it seems like
their energy level is endless.
I mean, they're always going.
Even when I get 'em home,
it takes another two hours
to wind 'em down
to get 'em into bed.
And sometimes they don't even fall asleep.
They up watching TV and stuff.
It keeps us pretty busy.
Sorry, Daddy.
Uh-oh!
Oh, wow.
I always mix up a King Whey shake,
and then I take this Yeah Buddy
pre-workout before I train.
And I take the Stacked-N.O. along with it,
and take a couple...
maybe a multivitamin
and vitamin C with it.
How much pain do you feel every day
on a scale of one to ten?
Uh, nine, ten.
Yeah, it's pretty heavy.
When I do appearances,
my pain level goes up to, like, a 12, 13.
Some was unbearable.
Some was unbearable.
If I'm in a whole lot of pain,
I'll just sit,
and just do the appearance...
and have people take pictures.
But for the most part, you know,
I always try to stand up.
I've been in pain for so long now,
I'm just used to it.
I take the pills, too.
Helps it a little bit.
Like I said, I take about...
four, sometimes five a day,
every single day.
They're called oxycodone,
these pills right here.
I even keep 'em with me.
They're 30 milligrams.
And, uh, they work...
They work pretty good.
This is the highest, uh...
The highest, uh...
potency you can get
is 30 milligrams.
So it eases the pain up a little bit...
for about three or four hours.
And then it comes right back.
Then I take another one.
Whoa.
Oh, ow.
- How's it going?
- Good.
Been busy?
Today, not really.
How did you decide to become
a professional bodybuilder?
After I graduated from the academy,
and they cut you loose on the street,
one of the guys saw me
on one of the calls, like,
"Man, you're a pretty big guy.
Where do you work out at?"
I told him, "Man, I work out
at the station, where it's free."
He said, "You ought to come over to
Metroflex, the gym I work out at."
So I go, "okay."
So I go to Metroflex and Brian is there.
My name is Brian Dobson.
I'm the owner and operator
of Metroflex Gym.
We're here in Arlington, Texas.
Brian is the guy that got me
into bodybuilding.
A friend of mine
brought me to this gym.
Brian was insistent
upon me bodybuilding,
and told me I could do good in the sport.
Finally told me that he'd
get me a free membership,
and I said, "Oh, what the heck?"
Brian Dobson.
I'm the owner of Metroflex Gym.
Been here since 1987.
I mean, you know,
we get new equipment here and there,
but pretty much stays the same, man.
We believe in the old-school ways.
Our training methods here are hard.
We get criticized a lot for that.
He trained in a dungeon-type gym. Uh...
In my terms,
it would be labeled as a shithole.
Rusty weights,
and very dusty, and whatever.
But that's where he trained
because he loved to train.
Yes, that place is a trip.
I mean, I was from California.
We got the ocean breeze
coming in through Gold's in Venice,
and I wasn't accustomed
to all the heat.
You know, a hundred-something
degrees in the gym.
I don't know how they do it,
but they do it.
It's hot as hell in there.
As soon as he walked in,
I knew who it was.
He had the red sweatshirt on,
and you could see the veins,
like, you know,
bulging through this thing.
And, of course, I was used to
being around champion bodybuilders,
but I don't think I'd ever seen that yet.
Brian kind of took me under his wing,
and taught me all the poses and stuff.
And then he would go over,
you know, like, diet and stuff
and tell me what I needed to eat.
The thing that separated him,
of course, was just,
his work ethic
from the very start has been supreme.
Never...
He was never one of
them guys you had to push.
My first show,
I went in, won first in overall.
And I'm like, "Whoa.
I can probably be pretty good at this."
When I was in high school,
the gym I worked out
was like Metroflex.
When I was in college, the gym
I worked out at was like Metroflex.
So I got accustomed
to working out at a gym
that had no A/C,
there's dirt on the floor,
there was no carpet.
And I kind of, like,
fell in love with that type of gym.
You know,
you get used to a certain thing,
you just don't want to change
'cause that's kind of like
what's worked for you...
your whole life.
And you fall in love with it,
and that's what you want to do.
And that's what Metroflex is,
and that's what it's been
for me all my life.
It's what I'm accustomed to doing,
and it's what made me successful.
So...
Like they say, if it ain't...
if it ain't broke, then, you know,
you ain't got nothing to fix there.
I knew he could be
Mr. Olympia one day.
There's no man
who trains harder anywhere.
I truly believe that
if Ronnie put his mind to it,
he could set the all-time
record in powerlifting,
and not only be the greatest
bodybuilder of all time,
but the greatest powerlifter
of all time, also.
I think Ronnie could be Mr. Olympia till
he's 45, 50 years old if he wanted to be.
Uh, this is 2000, I'm still here.
I've been here for almost 11, 12 years.
Been the happiest times of my life,
and I kind of, like, hope Brian's been
kind of happy with me being here.
Hell yeah.
I mean, Brian's kind of like,
you know, an angel to me
because, you know,
I've been working out now
for about 25 years.
And when I first walked
through that door,
Brian had told me
I could be a world champ.
And he stuck by his belief
and his feeling toward me.
It's kind of like
we got a bond here.
So, I think we're
kind of like a family.
I didn't do this thing all by myself.
I had some help.
And right here is my angel,
Brian Dobson.
Thank you, brother.
One of the stories
that stands out to me
goes all the way back to 1992,
Helsinki, Finland.
I believe that was
Ronnie Coleman's first Mr. Olympia.
He and I were one of the last
at the baggage claim,
and I thought, "What's he doing here?"
Like, "Who is he here with?"
I didn't know that he was actually there
to compete in the competition.
And lo and behold,
by the time the show was going on,
he was backstage warming up,
and he obviously was a work in progress.
I believe he got dead last
in that competition.
When it comes to Ronnie Coleman,
he was so far back in the pack
in my economy of a great bodybuilder.
You gotta remember,
I came up behind Lee Haney,
and behind Dorian Yates,
and with Flex, and with Kevin
and with Nasser,
and those were the guys
that made the fabric of the Mr. Olympia.
So every time I looked at someone
to measure where I stood,
it was never at Ronnie Coleman.
Ronnie, on a competitive level,
you just never thought about him.
Going into competitions, you know,
he was nowhere close.
If I was in the first call-out,
he was probably, like,
in the third or fourth, if that.
He was placing, you know,
in the back of the pack
a lot of the times.
I didn't even get a call-out, you know.
I didn't think I could be, like,
with the top guys anyway, so...
So I didn't even qualify
for the Olympia '93.
So I went to Olympia '94
and placed 15th, 16th, somewhere in there.
But at least they called me out
and compared me to the other guys.
So 1995 rolls around
and I went to Olympia that year
and I think I placed, like,
11th, somewhere in there,
12th, somewhere in there.
So, you know, I'm moving up in placing,
I'm doing a bit better, you know.
In '96, I did pretty good in Olympia.
I ended up in, like,
seventh place that year.
So things are getting better
and better every year.
'97 rolls around,
and that year at the Olympia,
I got ninth, you know.
I started noticing, you know,
this is the first year
and the second year, same thing.
Third year, same thing.
So Ronnie would be on the road
with Vickie Gates,
and just carrying his food.
We're talking about...
You gotta go from Spain
to compete in Italy, and, you know.
So he's got
this whole thing mapped out.
He's taking trains, you know.
We're flying and stuff.
And I'm like,
"Dude, why do you keep doing this?"
I felt like saying,
"Why are you wasting your time?"
I was like,
"Man, what are you doing?
I mean, I wouldn't even do this
if I'm not winning.
That's my approach,
'cause I'm out there to win.
And Ronnie looked at me
and he says,
"Because I love doing it.
I mean, I love bodybuilding."
He said, "Man, I love bodybuilding."
You know, when he said it like that,
I was like,
"Damn, yeah. You must really love it."
You know?
I can remember it like it was yesterday.
They finally let me in the Arnold Classic.
The show before the Arnold
was the Ironman,
and I ended up in, like,
third place, I think.
But the guy who won the show
was Lee Priest.
I'm like, "Man..."
"How did he beat me?"
You know, Lee about this tall.
I'm like, "I don't know
if this the sport for me."
So I'm at the Arnold Classic
and I remember, after the prejudge,
I went back to my room
and I, like...
My girlfriend at the time was Vickie...
a girl named Vickie Gates.
She was competing in the show, too.
I was like, "Vickie, I think I'm done
with this bodybuilding stuff.
They letting guys like Lee Priest beat me.
I don't think this is for me."
She's like,
"Boy, shut up. You ain't gonna quit."
And I thought about it.
I'm like, "You know what?
If I do quit, I might lose
my free membership to the gym, so...
I think I am gonna hang around here
for a little while longer."
I've always had back issues
from my high school days.
I hurt my back in high school.
I hurt my back in college.
One day, out on the football field,
something snapped
and I went to the chiropractor,
and I've been going to the chiropractor
ever since then.
We're going to, uh,
utilize the Apollo cold laser here.
With different types of laser therapies,
of course we want to protect the eyes.
The cold laser therapy...
is a slower laser therapy
that is utilized
for musculoskeletal injuries.
We're putting this on Ron's muscles here,
on the lateral aspect
of the paralumbars,
and then we're gonna
work our way down...
into the sacroiliac joint.
Ronnie had injured his back, I believe,
when he was doing a squat.
Yeah, it was painful, you know,
to have a disc just pop out.
I was getting ready for
the Arnold Classic at this time.
It was December 1996.
Squatting 600 pounds and, you know,
600 pounds for me is like nothing.
I always do, like, you know,
12 to 15 reps with that,
and I was coming up
on rep number eight
and "pow,"
the disc just popped out.
And I didn't know
what had happened, you know?
I just heard a loud pop.
I thought the guy, actually,
that was spotting me
had hit me to get me fired up,
you know, for the set.
But he told me,
"No, man, I didn't touch you."
I'm like, "What was that loud sound?"
He's like, "I don't know."
I'm like, "I don't know either,
but I'm done with squats."
So I went on over and did leg press,
I did my hamstrings,
a couple exercises.
Came home and I ate,
took a shower,
put on my uniform to go to work,
and I'm like,
"Wait a minute, I'm feeling pain."
And I'm like,
"Should I make this right turn
and go to work,
or should I make this left turn
and go to the hospital?"
So I made the left turn
and went to the hospital,
and found out, you know,
I had a herniated disc.
Have you ever recommended
for Ronnie to stop lifting so heavy?
Yeah.
I sure did.
You know, Ronnie, he had a goal in view.
He wanted to be the number one
bodybuilder in the world.
But, of course, eventually,
with the massive weights
that he was lifting,
those discs can, many, many times,
pay a pretty heavy price.
Bodybuilding, on the surface, is, again,
it's a great way
to build confidence, relationships,
um, overcome fears...
But it comes at a price for some.
Ronnie trained hard,
but did he train smart?
That was the only thing
that I questioned, especially now...
seeing Ronnie with injuries
and everything else.
Through time, I've wished
I'd known what I know now,
because I still think
that you could train...
not as heavy,
but train your body to failure,
or train your body to,
you know, gain lean muscle mass,
and not have to train where
you're gonna get injured.
I think someone like myself
or even like Ronnie Coleman,
we were just training
pedal to the metal.
It didn't matter, and we didn't think,
"Oh, we're gonna get injured doing this."
We just did it.
To get to that level,
you have to train like that.
You know,
Ronnie had enormous amounts of size,
and the quality of the muscle.
You know, that can't be done
through just sitting there,
pumping 25, 30, or 40-pound dumbbells.
He put the workload on his muscles
to make them get to a level
to where there were deep cuts
and deep striations, and hard work.
You know, and that's what
his body prevailed.
You saw that.
You know, so if you're not
willing to go to that place where...
where he is going to,
and train like that,
and withstand that,
and live like that,
and do that, and do that,
and do that,
you don't have a chance against him.
Woo-hoo!
Whoa, baby!
Lightweight, baby!
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!
Yeah!
Ronnie is number one, man.
Two! Three! Push it!
Yeah! Yeah!
Woo!
A lot of people don't know it,
but I learned
from the guys that beat me.
You know, I applied the same knowledge
when I was in college, you know.
If I'm not the smartest,
I'll go talk to the guys
that are the smartest.
And when I got to bodybuilding,
I wasn't the best, so I went
and talked to the guys
who were the best, like Flex and Kevin,
and all those guys,
and they gave me the knowledge
that took me to the next level.
We were in Russia one time
and he came to me,
and I had won everything, you know,
six straight shows.
I was placing like fourth
and fifth, you know, in every show,
because I was kinda, like,
burnt out for the most part,
you know,
from doing all those shows anyway.
I did the Olympia,
I did the show before the Olympia.
So I was kind of like burnt out,
but I remember
Kevin is winning every show,
and I'm like,
"What the hell is he doing
to win all these shows?"
So, I went to Kevin's room,
I'm like, "Kevin."
I was in there eating pizza
and stuff, you know,
just chilling.
I had just won a show.
Heard a knock on the door.
I look, open the door, it's Ronnie.
"Hey, man. What you doing?
You don't mind if I come in here?
I wanna ask you something."
I said, "All right, come on in, big dog."
You know, "what's up?"
"Man, what's the trick?
What you doing, Kevin?"
What are you doing?
How are you staying so hard
to win all these shows?
He's like,
"You wanna know what I'm doing?"
- I'm like, "Yeah!"
- I said, "Dude,"
I said, "Listen, man." I said,
"You've been carrying your food around.
You're so serious. You're measuring out
your food. You're doing...
You gotta just relax, Ronnie."
I said, "Why don't you
just have a seat, man,
do a shot of this vodka with me?"
So he goes over to his coffee maker
and pours a little coffee in the cup.
Then he goes to the refrigerator...
and pulls out a bottle of vodka,
and he poured that into the cup.
And he said, uh...
"Drink that."
I'm like...
"I don't drink no alcohol,
Kevin, you know that.
I don't drink no alcohol, man.
Man, bodybuilders can't do that."
I don't drink no vodka.
I don't drink alcohol.
I said, "Look, big dog." I said, "Listen,
take a shot of this vodka, man.
You'll be all right."
I said, "You know, just chill,
man. Take it easy."
So he took a shot.
"Man, you sure?"
I said, "Yeah, I'm sure."
So I'm like, "Okay."
So he drank it, and...
"Man, this stuff don't taste right.
Man, I ain't used to this in my body.
But if you say do it, I'm gonna do it."
I said,
"All right, go ahead and drink that."
All right, so he drank it,
and we sit down and talk a little more.
Talked about training,
working out.
I gave him another shot,
gave him another shot.
Gave him another shot, right?
So by the fifth shot he's like,
"Man, this stuff's pretty good.
Got a... let me have
another shot of that.
Man, that vodka,
that made me feel real good."
So he got up, and I says,
"Man," I said, "Listen,
eat some of this pizza,"
ate a little bit of pizza.
And he left and went to his room.
So I didn't see him until
the next morning when we woke up.
You know, when...
saw him backstage,
pumping up,
pulled his clothes off.
And I looked at him, dude,
and my jaw's just dropped.
I was like...
"Damn."
I drank that coffee and that vodka,
and I went to the show
the next day and beat Kevin.
I think that by him
having the alcohol,
it dehydrated him just a little more,
but it was able to also relax him,
to not think about any food,
not think about anything,
and I think that
relaxed state of mind
just let the water
just leave his body.
And when Ronnie hit that stage,
man, it was all over.
It was like,
"Where'd this dude come from?"
I remember going into
the Olympia, they said,
"Dorian ain't competing this year,
so the Olympia's wide open."
Flex had been getting second.
Kevin had been getting second.
Shawn Ray had been getting second.
Nasser had been getting second.
and I'm like,
"Well, I ain't got a prayer."
Leading up to the competition, you know,
it was highly
anticipated
because Dorian wasn't there anymore,
and everyone is, like, trying to see
where they're gonna fit in.
There was me,
Nasser El Sonbaty, Kevin.
Ronnie Coleman wasn't
even on my top six list.
The media at the time,
which was only magazines,
was pumping up Flex Wheeler,
you know.
Flex Wheeler,
you know, Sultan of Symmetry.
Flex Wheeler, you know,
'93 Arnold Classic.
You know, '94.
You're expecting this.
He managed to go
from getting his pro card
to being, you know,
the top in Mr. Olympia
all in the same year,
and that was just...
that was in '93.
His first pro year
he swept through everything.
Every pro show, he won.
And as the Olympia came,
he kinda really expected
for that to, one day,
you know, end up on his mantel.
Flex Wheeler, congratulations
for winning the Arnold's Classic,
and tell me now,
how much did it help you
to come out of this kind
of momentum of winning
the Ironman competition
a week ago?
I think it played a tremendous
influence on me,
especially that
that was my first pro... pro debut,
and I won that show, and I think
it gave me a little momentum
going into this show,
which I think I needed quite a bit.
Flex was always
the heir apparent to the title.
Flex Wheeler was definitely looking to be
the heir apparent to the throne.
He was the heir apparent.
Logically, he would be the guy to win.
From that time, he was always
destined to be the next guy.
I would've bet millions
he would never win the Olympia.
The first five, six years of his career
he was a journeyman pro,
had had a good few shows,
but you never really thought
he was gonna make the breakthrough.
When I saw him backstage
in New York City,
I knew that it was pretty much
game over for me.
It was night and day.
There was Ronnie,
and then there was everybody else.
We all took off our clothes
and went out there to compete.
That's when you knew
that it was gonna be
a changing of the guard.
I remember going to the show
and being compared
to Flex and Kevin, and, you know,
those guys that had already won.
And a couple times
they had put me in the middle,
and I'm like,
"Oh, I'm doing pretty good here.
They put me in the middle,
comparing me to the big dogs
of the sport."
I think in 1998
the world had never seen
the total package that
Ronnie Coleman presented,
and when he presented that package,
he knocked out a bunch of Hall of Fame
bodybuilders in their prime.
And although Flex Wheeler
thought he was in the hunt,
I don't think he was beating
Ronnie Coleman in any of the poses.
My goal was just
to place in the top five, you know?
I was like, "Man, if I can just place
top five in the Olympia,"
you know,
"it'd be a dream come true."
And I remember they called,
you know, like fifth and sixth,
and I'm still standing there,
and they called fourth,
and I'm like,
"Oh shucks, I'm doing pretty good."
Third and I'm still standing there.
I'm like, "Whoa."
And then I can remember
me and Flex standing there,
and they were
down to first and second.
I'm like, "Wow."
I was truly blown away.
And then Wayne,
when he called out second place
he waited for a long time.
Flex Wheeler!
That's when he collapsed, of course,
the famous officer down move that he did.
But I think that got to everybody.
That made everybody in that theater,
Madison Square Garden, warm to this guy.
Here was a guy, real emotion
at taking the sport's top title
when nobody thought
he had a chance.
It was a Rocky story, you know?
Everybody was happy for him.
To be at the top,
the best in the whole world,
you can't get no better feeling
in the world than that.
I suspect somebody
cut this one open.
- Was it you?
- Maybe.
Uh-huh. Okay.
I want you to know
these are very, very expensive.
You have to just adjust to
whether he's going to be here
or not be here
for long periods of time.
The household is run
more or less the same way,
but there's... I mean,
there's a few differences, of course,
'cause there's one extra person
or one less person.
And I have to buy another one
now to get your other ankle.
At least I gave you money.
Yes, at least you gave me money.
Every now and then,
it's challenging on me and him,
but I mean, we're grown-ups.
We understand
this is the way it is and it's okay.
And, you know,
technology helps a lot,
but it's challenging
on the children, the girls.
You know, 'cause they miss him.
And as they get older,
they understand better,
you know,
he has to go, but he'll be back.
I just don't really
wanna wash the dishes.
Only if you come outside
with me to play.
- After?
- I wash the dishes.
Deal.
Lola is the one in black,
and she is just like me.
Suzy, the one in blue,
she's emotional like me,
but, in a weird kinda way,
she's analytical like him as well.
- Lola!
- Yes?
You gonna come
to the swing with us?
Okay, you gonna get
in the swing with sister?
Do you want me to push you?
- No!
- "No!"
You don't need me to push you.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because you're strong.
Strong like Dad.
One reason we have so many kids
is because he and I both love kids.
You know, when you choose that,
it becomes your world,
and I don't know that you change
into a different person,
or you just evolve into
the person you've always been,
which is the person who cares
about the next generation,
and what happens with them.
He was a simple country boy
from Louisiana
that came from not having
much of a chance
to dominating the sport.
Yeah, I mean, Ronnie took it
to another level with the size.
He was metamorphosizing
into something
that we'd never seen before.
Ronnie Coleman had reached a point
where he didn't look human backstage.
Lee Haney already had
the record about numbers.
He had eight Mr. Olympias.
Ronnie matched that.
The guys that got second to Lee Haney,
when you stacked them up
against the guys
that were getting second
to Ronnie Coleman, um...
Ronnie Coleman was
putting to waste guys
that arguably could be Mr. Olympia.
I was still working
for the police department, too.
I worked, let's see...
my first three or four Olympias.
I worked for the most part
until the Olympia came around.
Olympia came around,
I'd take, like, three months off,
and get ready for the show.
I didn't go to work or nothing.
I didn't even know he was
a cop for a long, long time.
You know, until he started beating me.
So, yeah,
it brought a lot of attention to...
to him, and...
what he was as a person,
and as a man, you know.
You couldn't beat him in size,
couldn't beat him in condition,
and, you know, when you're
just really feeling yourself,
I mean, you know...
peacock strutting with his tail...
all his feathers out.
I think once he tasted victory,
he didn't wanna taste defeat,
and that can move mountains as well.
People wanted to have that size.
People wanted to adopt
what he has adopted
through his physique.
The Mr. Olympia,
for Ronnie Coleman's confidence,
was exactly what I think he needed
to cement and put the ribbon
around who he was.
I mean, because it's like
winning the lottery,
but lottery's luck.
When I first started competing,
I was 215, my first... when I turned pro.
When I won my seventh Olympia
I was 296, almost 300 pounds.
So I went from 215 to almost 300.
It was like a gradual thing.
I was getting bigger year by year,
so you couldn't really see
a whole lot of size
come on me at one time.
But I do remember
the first time I hit 300,
'cause I couldn't bend over.
The bigger Ronnie Coleman, years later,
was not the quality Ronnie Coleman
that won in New York in '98.
But the judges saw it differently,
that Ronnie Coleman was just
too big and too muscular,
and that's, I think, the turning point
in our sport where they started
over-rewarding size over quality.
When he started getting bigger,
started just losing that look,
that small waist,
and he just got too thick,
which I think was a mistake.
Sometimes he was heavier
and bigger and blockier,
but he was on such another level
in terms of the muscle size.
Ronnie Coleman, you know,
still won the eight Olympias,
but it was questionable
on the last two Olympias that he won,
or the last Olympia that he won.
Ronnie was starting to get
a little heavier than what he, uh...
what was best for his physique.
His Olympia look wasn't as great.
It was 2001, and I did the Arnold Classic,
and I decided I was gonna do
the Olympia that same year.
The night before the show,
I'm getting tanned.
My girlfriend is putting my tan on,
and we're in the bathroom.
All of a sudden, I just faint.
And I've never
in my whole life fainted before.
And I wake up,
I'm in the tub, you know.
I'm like, "What happened?"
They're like, "You fainted."
I'm like, "What?"
I've never... this has
never happened to me before.
The next morning
when I wake up to get out of bed,
I'm so tired, I'm so exhausted,
I can't get out of bed.
I know how I'm supposed to feel,
you know, the morning of the show
and I'm always very energetic,
and I'm ready to go,
and I'm ready to fight,
and I'm ready to get it on.
This morning, I'm very exhausted,
I can't get out of bed, I'm so tired.
I'm so tired to the point that
I actually feel like I'm about to die.
So I call my nutritionist,
I say, "Hey, dude."
"Hey, the show is over with for me,"
you know?
"I'm going to the hospital."
He's like, "No, man, don't do that.
You put too much work into this."
He's like, "Just grab a gallon of water
and just drink as much as you can
until you feel like you're okay."
So, I'm like, "Okay."
So that's what I did.
I grabbed a gallon of water.
I think I drank about the whole gallon,
you know, that morning,
uh, for the morning show.
And by the time I finished
that gallon of water
I felt pretty good, and I'm like, "Okay,
I'm all right now.
I'm back to my old self."
He's at the top, being Mr. Olympia,
and then there was guys like
Jay Cutler who was chasing him.
I went into the Mr. Olympia
every year thinking I was gonna win.
I never had a doubt.
He was an obstacle for...
I was trying to be the best in the world.
You know,
and Ronnie was standing in my way.
So every year it was a battle
against Ronnie Coleman.
I didn't give a shit
about anyone else but Ronnie Coleman
because I knew that was the only
guy that could possibly beat me.
In 2001, a lot of people thought
Jay Cutler had beaten him,
and he beat him based on
the dryness and the hardness
of his frame,
but the judges saw it differently,
that Ronnie Coleman was just
too big and too muscular.
Jay was sort of satisfied that
he'd made the big breakthrough.
I thought he'd won.
When I landed that second place in 2001,
I was highly disappointed, even though
I may not have shown it on stage,
because I put a lot of effort
into training for that contest.
The policeman out of Arlington, Texas,
Ronnie Coleman.
Jay Cutler has to wonder what
he has to do to upset the champion.
When I looked at this house,
I fell in love with it.
It was brand-new.
I moved here in '96, 21 years.
I paid cash for it
when I won my first Olympia.
I notice you have
your own gym here, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You wanna check it out?
Yeah.
Everything that I used at Metroflex
I put in here.
My hack squat,
my leg extension, leg curl.
My calf machine over there.
I got a decline, I got an incline,
and I got a flat bench.
It start at 5,
and go all the way up to 200.
I even put a T-bar row here.
My legs are still numb
so I can't go heavy.
I do light, so...
They'd call the police on me
all the time when I used to work out.
'Cause I'd be... I'd be loud.
Duke, this way. Let's go.
It's hot in here.
Yeah.
Remember I told you
we had the gas, uh...
stealing out of the cars.
We got this monitor right here.
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh, yeah.
The, uh, lights down there,
they come on at night.
You walk past and it lights up
the whole thing down there.
The day that Jay Cutler
actually beat Ronnie Coleman,
you could hear a collective...
passing of the torch.
The crowd shift,
it just really went straight to Jay.
I think a lot of people were
making up for the 2001 victory
that Jay should've got that he didn't get.
People were cheering for the upset.
We'd seen so much of Ronnie Coleman
that eventually, like Mike Tyson,
you tune in to hopefully see
the champ get knocked out.
The younger version of you
is lurking out there somewhere,
and, you know, you're gonna meet
that hellfire person.
So, it happens.
I was fed up.
I wasn't sure how much longer
I could keep getting second place,
and my whole family came out.
You know, I always had my family there,
my brothers, sisters,
everyone came out, family friends.
I think I bought 100 tickets
that event, that year.
Ronnie came in off.
Ronnie doubted himself that night.
And I remember being backstage
and seeing it, you know, unfold.
You know, when you compete at that level,
you can kind of sense and see.
You get to know people's personalities
and their approach and everything,
and Ronnie just showed up
as a different Ronnie that night.
Ronnie was going for nine
and didn't get nine.
Jay Cutler beat him.
The Olympia gold medal
to the 2006 Mr. Olympia...
...Jay Cutler!
When Jay knocked out the champ,
it validated years of work
that Ronnie Coleman had done before him.
And there's not a champion
out there that's not susceptible
to getting knocked out,
and getting beaten.
We've seen it happen.
We saw Mike Tyson lose,
we saw Muhammad Ali lose,
and we saw Ronnie Coleman lose to Jay.
The night I beat Ronnie,
2006, it was a flash.
He knew he was gonna lose,
and I think he didn't think that
until the very end,
because he was Ronnie Coleman.
He hadn't lost in a very long time.
I thought it was pretty much automatic
that I was gonna win number nine,
because I had won, like,
eight in a row, so like,
you know, you come up
for number nine, and, like, okay...
Those eight were...
you know, I worked hard for 'em.
So I'm thinking, you know,
number nine's just gonna be a breeze.
I won on that stage,
and it was the first time in history
that a Mr. Olympia
was beaten on that stage.
When Ronnie Coleman
was beaten by Jay Cutler,
it took a little bit of the shine off.
I can only imagine Ronnie Coleman
being Mr. Olympia for, like, eight times.
And then he loses to a guy
that he was routinely beating
in head-to-head competition.
In the end, it was...
It happened, you know? Jay took him,
but that wasn't Ronnie at his best.
You know, the injuries
had shown up, and, you know,
he was battle-worn by that time.
I didn't beat the best
Ronnie Coleman ever.
I don't want people ever
to think like, "Oh, well,
Ronnie was at his best
and Jay was at his best."
That's not the case.
I just was better that day.
You know, time was creeping up,
he was going for his record number nine.
Lot of publicity going into the show.
But I felt bad for Ronnie.
I felt bad winning, which is weird.
Because, you know, he was...
it was everything to him,
you know,
and he was going for number nine.
It was the record,
it'd beat Lee Haney's record.
And he was upset, you know?
He was visually upset.
My name is Mike Hisey.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon
with the Texas Back Institute
and I specialize in spine surgery.
So, Ronnie came to me from
a friend of mine who has known him,
and has worked out with Ronnie
for years and years.
And when he had a particular problem
with his back
that Rob knew that I knew
how to operate on,
he referred Ronnie to me.
And it's an advanced stage
of, really, degeneration,
wear and tear,
and it's from all of the weight
he's been putting through
his back over the years.
So it had worn out the discs.
And he had had operations
before I met him
to try and unpinch some
of the nerves and make room
for the nerves,
and then ultimately an attempt
at trying to hold the bones still
that didn't heal up.
So, we tried to do another
operation to get him to heal up
and try and improve his alignment.
These are the artificial hips now,
they were already in
by the time I met him.
Here's one of them and the other.
And then you can see the screws,
and you can see how collapsed
this disc is.
We were able to lift it up some.
Got his alignment a little bit better.
Now he's got this spacer in here.
This is lifted up. We were able
to get that one lifted up.
You see how collapsed this one is.
We weren't able to get this one
pulled back as far as I'd hoped,
but some, and this looks like it's...
on the CAT scan,
it looks like it's healed.
We were able to get the nerves
unpinched at that level.
Disc is okay, but the joint
is wearing to some degree.
We see this all the time.
Not all of our patients
are competitive bodybuilders.
It's a common problem,
but he puts himself at higher risk.
You know,
some of the people are gonna get it
because of their genetics.
It's years, miles, and your activity.
And his activity, I think,
is what put him at the risk,
and it's what he lives for.
So, we're just taking care of it.
Doctor said he's gonna go in
and perform a surgery
in which he's gonna
take out the screws, 'cause...
uh, from that nerve block shot
that I had.
The pain went away for a whole day,
and that showed that the hardware
was causing the pain, those screws.
Screw was just there
just to hold the fusion in place.
They fused my discs together.
They've been there almost two years.
They've pretty much done their job.
All they're doing now
is just causing me pain.
He's still working out, obviously.
- He's still in the gym.
- I don't think he'll ever stop.
And do you think
that's a positive thing?
Would you recommend it, or not?
If I had to pick, just for his back,
it's probably not the best thing.
But for his overall well-being,
I think he needs to.
Step in the room,
we'll check out your nerves and stuff.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Where's your wife today?
She's got the kids.
Just scooch on back there.
- Put these here.
- Lift your big toes up for me.
Hold 'em up real strong. Real strong.
You're a little weak on this one still.
Yeah, that one's real weak.
Okay, push down strong,
down towards the floor, strong.
That's much better.
How 'bout hold it up straight.
Hold that up real strong.
Straight, straight, straight.
Hold this one up real strong.
Straight, straight, straight.
- Oh, that's gotten so much better.
- Yeah.
That's gotten so much better.
So much better.
Yeah, that's perfect. Now, let me just...
- That may not come back.
- That ain't gonna come back.
That may not come back.
That ain't worked in some...
a whole lot of years.
Yeah, I don't think
I've ever seen that one work.
I don't think this one does either.
No, no, no.
Yeah, he's an amazing guy
in terms of being able to
work through things.
But, with this operation,
with as much time as we had to spend,
it's not uncommon that weakness
on the leg on the side we go in.
And, so he had that,
and that's been getting better,
but it certainly was an issue
for him early on, post-op.
I don't think he's done with
treating his back by any means,
but I think he's on his way.
His recovery, I think,
is better than average
for what he had to start with.
It's not perfect.
There may come a time when he wants
to try and get it a little bit better,
in which case we might extend it up
and get a few more levels
above or below
to correct his overall alignment.
I don't think it's gonna do anything about
getting strength back,
but it may help with pain
and it may help him stand up
a little bit taller.
What happened was,
they put in four screws
'cause the discs were shifting forward
and pushing up against my nerves.
So they had to
clamp them together,
and they used these screws.
Anyway, those screws ended up breaking.
And in the process of breaking,
they broke bones in my back.
You know, and then the pain got so bad
where I couldn't even walk.
Hey, guys! What's going on?
Big Ron here, coming live
to you from the...
what I deem my...
Ronnie Coleman recovery center.
You know, a lot of people
that go through this kind of surgery
tend to have the mindset
that they may be in a wheelchair,
and they say people like that, who...
eventually do go to wheelchair,
never get out.
And they could,
but it's just a mental...
you know, thing that they have.
And it's never occurred to Ronnie.
I'm ready to take off.
I'm gonna take off in flight
in a second here.
Put some nitrous
on that wheelchair.
So I stayed in the hospital
for like a whole month,
trying to get better,
and trying to deal with the pain.
And this is what I get
early in the morning
for the next day's meal.
I'll be having cranberry juice.
It was real bad, you know?
But I made it through all that.
I started out in a wheelchair,
did that for a while.
Then I graduated to a walker,
did that for a while.
And then I got to the point
where I got the crutches.
Doing that for a while,
and I'm still on crutches,
but, for the most part,
I can walk around the house,
like short distances,
but I use the crutches
for like when I have to walk
for like long distances
and stuff like that, so...
I say I've come a long way.
The six and seven-year-old,
they're kinda like figure skaters,
both of them.
Susan, of course, she's a lot older,
so she's a national level competitor.
This family comes first.
We're the ones he chose.
- Lo-lo.
- What?
- Give me huggie?
- No.
He's very good with them.
He's very patient.
Quitting too soon,
you might have regrets.
Lee Haney was 31 years old,
but he had 8 Sandows,
nothing else to prove,
and he was able to turn the page.
The majority of the guys
are gonna go out of this sport
a loser, so how do you go out, you know?
I think Ronnie's one of those
guys that would go out fighting.
With Ronnie, win or lose,
he always was always the same, you know?
And he's always been
very humble like that,
and, you know,
I can appreciate who he is
because that's
what makes a champion, is...
someone that can stand on all stages
and be thankful for every gift
that they're given,
and indirectly affect a lot of people.
I didn't wanna see Ronnie Coleman
get on stage in 2007.
I didn't wanna see him push
and not get rewarded.
It's hard to advise bodybuilders
of that caliber
what they should or shouldn't do,
because they are in control
of their careers.
But I think Ronnie Coleman did
what was best for him.
If there was a way for him
to compete tomorrow, or next week,
or this year, Ronnie Coleman,
I don't think any of us
would stop him from doing it.
Thank God he's not a boxer,
because he'd probably be,
you know, brain dead.
People, they know the type of talent,
and they know how hard I worked,
and they know
I put my all and all into it.
You know, I don't have any
regrets about it, you know, so.
Everybody said, "Oh, what a shame.
That's how we'll remember him."
No, you'll remember the eight-time champ.
Nobody remembers
the fourth time.
Nobody remembers Muhammad Ali,
last two or three fights,
being in shambles.
They remember the king
when he was on top.
That's how they'll remember Ronnie,
with that big smile and that personality
who's got time for everybody,
who's never turned
a fan down.
I've never seen in
a temperamental mood.
So he's got a great legacy.
As well as being the best
bodybuilder of all time,
he's one of the most loved, I'm sure.
Not used to getting up
in the morning, you know.
Takes a minute for me to get going.
Not really used to it.
Never get used to it.
I've been here almost 30 years now.
Long time.
Yeah, when I first came here,
there was hardly nothing here.
Weren't that many people or nothing.
Now, man, it's just doubled in size.
Just like that.
They put up houses everywhere,
do all kinds of stuff.
Made this place huge.
I came to this city and this gym
about the same time.
It was thirty-something years now.
Yup.
- How you feeling, bro?
- Same old, same old. You?
Another day at the office.
- Little bit cooler this morning.
- Yeah, I was surprised.
Warm yesterday during the day.
It was warm yesterday.
I got up this morning, went outside.
When I first got out of the hospital,
both my legs were numb.
Now I got to the point
where just one is numb.
The numbness is going away slowly.
I remember when I had my neck done,
uh, the doctor told me
it was gonna take two years
for the numbness to go away.
And I remember two years to the date,
the numbness went away totally.
So I know that if my neck can recover
and the numbness can go away there,
that I can recover, also,
in my legs and stuff.
If somebody embodied
what Mr. Olympia was like,
I think Ronnie Coleman probably
loved being Mr. Olympia
more than anybody else.
And I had to be happy for him.
But Ronnie Coleman took bodybuilding
to another whole level when
it came to size and symmetry.
Size and symmetry.
You know, we had someone
like Dorian that introduced mass
into the bodybuilding era,
but then Ronnie did it
with aesthetics as well.
I don't think there's still
been anybody since
that, you know,
brought the same combination
of size, shape, and condition.
Not only with a great chest,
not only with a great back,
not only with all those arms
and everything...
shoulders, glute, hamstring.
It was just unparalleled.
He just had it all.
He had the training,
he had the crazy diet that was...
He was able to eat, you know,
all these crazy things,
and be able to still get that kinda shape.
He brought a lot to the table,
you know, and, uh...
He was the strongest
Mr. Olympia of all time.
Oh, yeah!
- Keep going!
- Yeah, baby!
Lightweight, baby!
Yeah!
Yeah! Lightweight!
Yeah, baby!
He was a beast, and, you know,
he set a new standard
for bodybuilding, which,
you know, came to my time,
and I couldn't get as big as him.
Phil Heath took over, he's not even close
to big as Ronnie was.
You know, they can't compare
Phil Heath to Ronnie Coleman.
Ronnie Coleman was challenged
by Hall of Fame bodybuilders,
and, of course,
in Phil Heath era, he's not.
And I say this today, I still think that
Ronnie Coleman, at his best,
would still win the Mr. Olympia today.
I don't know if you can say mindfuck,
but it's a mindfuck to the max.
Like, you can't imagine coming from
being the upper echelon of your sport
to not being that anymore,
and then just having to deal
with that part.
To be on the other side of that
is pretty hard, you know?
I won't lie, I cried the first time.
You know, I never told him
that or anything, but, you know,
seeing him like... 'cause to me,
his strength was supernatural.
I mean, it was so above
and beyond everybody else's.
You know, it was very, very hard
to see that, you know,
especially when the hips went
and he had to use a walker
and all that.
That was tough for me.
And, you know, he got down to,
I don't know, 215 pounds
probably at one point, maybe.
You know, 220.
And I mean, I'd never seen him
that small ever, you know?
- Lola.
- Hello.
Wake up.
I know.
The Nuggets whisper up
on the Clippers for the eighth spot.
- Where you at?
- About five minutes away.
- Okay, all right. I was just...
- Five minutes away.
...making sure you made it okay.
Oh, yeah. Be there in just a minute.
- You okay? Doing good?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm all good.
Ready to get this over with.
I heard that, man.
Wish it was already done.
You and me both.
All right, we'll see you in a minute.
- All right, big bro.
- All right, bye.
See, this surgery's gonna last
only like three hours,
but the only thing about it is...
instead of going through my back,
because I've had
so many back surgeries
and I have so much scar tissue there,
they've gotta go through
the front now.
In order to go through the front,
there's all this stuff in the front,
you know, to get to the back.
So he's gotta take out my intestines.
Gotta take those out
to get to the back.
So, he said this surgery
should last about three hours,
but the recovery time is gonna be
the same as the last surgery.
Six months again.
- You made it in, huh?
- Of course.
Yeah, the traffic's always fun.
You ready to go,
ready to do this thing?
I remember the doctor said
when he took a break
he would always go out
and talk to my mom.
She was there the whole time.
Unfortunately, she's no longer here
'cause she passed away in August
from, you know, pancreatic cancer.
You know, she was always there
at all my surgeries.
So, you know, that's gonna be
real hard to go through
and not have her there,
'cause I'm so used to,
you know, waking up
and seeing her.
All right, Ronnie.
Let's get this thing done.
Yeah, buddy.
- We're gonna back you in.
- Okay.
It's very sad, you know?
It hits hard for me, because...
remember,
I stood next to him,
and battled him, and, uh...
I admired the way he trained,
and sometimes I wish...
I'd go,
"Man, I wish I could do that."
And now I look at it and say,
"Wow," you know...
You know, "What did it?"
I don't know the answer,
'cause Ronnie's not gonna cry
about anything.
That's the thing
about Ronnie Coleman.
He's not gonna make excuses for himself,
"Well, this is why it happened."
He'd rather just say...
you know, when people say, "Hey..."
You know, "You're laid up.
You had this many surgeries.
What do you think?"
He goes, "Well...
I'm really disappointed
I only squatted 800 twice."
That's just Ronnie.
Everything negative is a positive to him,
and that's why he's great.
I think I could've got five with 800.
I could've got five reps.
I think I could've got five easy reps,
But I went... I did the 800 squat,
and then I went to the leg press
and I put 2,300 on there,
and I got 8 reps.
So I kinda made up for it there.
I can't feel sad for Ronnie Coleman,
because I knew
that there would be a price
to pay for what he was doing,
and I think, for him,
that price was worth it.
Ronnie Coleman was
one of the few bodybuilders
that paid his house off,
bought his mom a house,
took care of his entire family,
created his own supplement line,
and had multiple opportunities worldwide
to see the globe,
as a result of what he did.
So, if this is the price
you have to pay,
I think if you ask Ronnie,
he'd say he'd do it again.
If you ask me, I would say it's foolish.
I would never do that.
I don't want any of those
Sandow trophies
to have the body that 53,
54-year-old Ronnie Coleman has.
It wouldn't be worth it for my lifestyle.
And that's why you gotta respect the guy,
because he could be crying to everyone,
"Well, I'm so beat up," and, you know,
"Bodybuilding did this to me,"
but Ronnie's enjoying his time
with his kids,
he's doing his travel still.
He's making the best of it.
He's wheeling in expos in a wheelchair.
I feel sorry that it happened,
but I don't think Ronnie
feels sorry about it,
because, you know what?
He just did what he had to do
to be the greatest bodybuilder
of all time.
And he will go down in history as
the greatest bodybuilder of all time.
Hold on tight, Laila.
I've been bodybuilding for 10 years...
and I've been working here for 12.
And the famous question is,
"Why do you still work here...
and you're Mr. Olympia,
two-time Mr. Olympia?"
My answer to that question is,
"Because I love it."
I was just in China, you know...
and, you know,
there's a language barrier and everything,
but whenever I said something like...
- Lightweight, baby.
- Lightweight.
..."Lightweight, baby,"
everybody got it without the interpreter.
Ronnie took the time to write
back to every fan.
And the people around us would be like,
"Man, I can't keep up to Ronnie,"
you know?
He had everything timed perfect,
but he would sit and do his emails, like,
at that super early time
of the morning, to every fan.
I had to throw everything
I had from New York,
and he said the best burgers are in Texas.
I said, "No way, Ronnie,"
I took him to...
I had to take him to Old Homestead.
I'm just kinda looking at him,
"Oh, I hope I'm right.
I hope...
I hope I'm right."
You know, took Mr. Olympia,
you know, arguing with him
on the best burger in Texas.
So, bites into this burger...
all he kept saying was,
"Man, this ain't no burger.
This ain't no burger!"
And I was like,
"Yes, I think I got him."
And after years of hard work
and struggles, you know,
I was able to get that Olympia title.
But, you know,
that's not the reason why I got into it.
The reason why I got into it
was 'cause he told me
he'd give me a free membership.
