Let's do it!
The women sure love him, don't they?
Everybody loves him.
They sure do.
Thanks for the interview, Lula.
Tell Dusty I'll pick up the second half
in Shreveport, will you, please?
Absolutely.
Look at him.
He could stand there and look cross-eyed
and they'd still scream.
- Did you play him my song?
- I told ya I would.
When?
When the time is right.
And when will that be?
When I say.
I'll be in Dusty's bus...
...if anybody wants me.
I can do something about that.
God bless!
We're bringing him in.
You killed them tonight, boss.
Great show. Better than ever.
Incredible sounds.
What?
You all right?
It's all that damn smoke.
It was a great show tonight,
don't ya think?
Bobby Louis went on and on
about that interview.
Bobby Louis is a jerk.
We need him.
He's gonna give you good publicity
for your new record.
Earl and I wrote a really nice song.
We're thinkin' maybe...
...we'd like to simplify the arrangements
on this new album.
That reminds me...
I got a new song I want you
to try out the next few nights.
I think it's gonna be your new single.
Come on, give a listen.
I said I had some new ideas for this album.
When he first approached me, I said no...
...but this song's really somethin'.
Who?
Who?
Buddy Jackson.
Buddy Jackson?
With the road crew?
Yes. With the road crew.
I don't remember you bein' much more
than road crew when I found you.
Couldn't draw more than 20 people.
I had good taste then, didn't I?
Hold it!
- Hold it!
- Come back here!
Buddy?
That's great. That's great.
Thank you.
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
What's not?
It just needs...
It just needs more... energy.
More energy?
See what I mean?
More energy. More energy.
What else?
Then we bring in the strings.
Bring in the horns.
It's gonna sound great.
We'll bring the strings and the horns in.
Accordion.
How about the accordion?
No accordion?
No accordion?
What else?
- That's it.
- That's it?
Thank you. We'll work on it.
Thank you so much.
- It'll sound great.
- Thanks a bunch.
Get him out of here.
Come over here. Come on.
I want to talk to you.
What a nerd!
Don't ever, ever do that again!
Do what again?
You really don't know, do you?
He is the big star. You are the road crew.
- I won't be if that song...
- You will if you don't listen to me.
Now you are a very talented guy.
And you're real cute, too.
There are a lot of talented cute guys
dying to be where he's at.
I got him there.
I can get you there, too.
But you've gotta listen to me.
Did you hear them?
They went crazy over my song.
You're not supposed to be in here.
So what if I'm in here?
See you next trip.
I don't want him to find you here. Go on.
Out.
So what if he finds me here?
You were really killin' them tonight, boss.
Great show. Better than ever.
Incredible sound.
Hear them screamin'?
They went crazy!
That's exciting.
What was Buddy Jackson doin' in here?
'"See you next trip? '"
Since when do you start
changin' my show?
Your show?
I don't remember seein' you out there
makin' those people scream.
What is your problem, Dusty?
I'm tired.
I'm tired of the smoke and the lights.
It ain't me.
It's not a cowboy bar with a bunch
of drunks sittin' around a little stage.
This is 20,000 people. They came to see
your show, and they want to see a big one.
Hell, they can't see me
for all the smoke and the lights.
They can't hear me,
the music's so damn loud.
I stopped singing out there for three bars.
Three bars, and nobody even noticed.
- What are you tryin' to say?
- I'm sayin' I don't like it!
I don't like the sets.
I don't like the lights.
And I don't like you sneakin'
your boyfriend in my bus.
And I don't like you crammin'
his songs down my throat.
He is your boyfriend, isn't he?
My personal life is none
of your business anymore.
Well, maybe your business
doesn't belong in my show.
If it wasn't for me...
...you would probably still be singin'
in some run-down rat hole...
...for a bunch of fat cowgirls from Iowa.
And if it wasn't for me,
you'd probably be a waitress there.
You listen to me.
Cute guys like you who can sing are
a dime a dozen. I can find me another one.
Go find one then.
Fine!
Relax, just relax.
Sounds like you need a beer, brother.
You heard?
No, thanks.
Man...
...why does it always have to be like this?
I mean,
everything's gotten so complicated.
Sometimes I just want to dump
the whole deal.
Includin' this stupid-looking outfit.
Oh, hell, Wyatt! It's better than a real job.
Besides, you're helping me pay
my alimony.
Man...
...remember when we was kids,
we snuck out to that carnival?
That one we snuck into
'cause we didn't have the money.
Yeah, with that fat, old...
...bald-headed guy
with the sweaty armpits.
Had that dancin' chicken.
Remember when he put
that chicken on stage?
We snuck around back. With one hand,
he was puttin' the needle on the record.
And with his other, he was turnin'
on the stove underneath the stage.
That chicken... his feet was burnin'.
He started hoppin' all over the place,
just dancin'.
The dancin' chicken!
Sometimes I feel like a dancin' chicken.
You know what I always wondered?
Why didn't that chicken
just hop off the stage?
Sure you don't want one?
What are you gonna do tonight?
Sit right here...
...smell the horse manure...
...finish down this six-pack...
...and go find me a fine-looking woman.
Wife for a night.
How about you?
I think I'm just gonna take me a little walk.
Take care.
Thanks. See you.
Get his bags.
What are you doin'?
Just wanted to feel
like I was out in California.
Where's Dusty?
He took a walk.
Where?
- I don't know.
- Knock it off.
I'm worried.
Did you see him last night?
Yeah.
What was he doin'?
Was he drunk?
No.
I was.
Did he say where he was goin'?
Yeah.
Where did he say he was goin'?
To take a walk.
You boys are makin' me work.
You know I don't like that.
Oh, yeah. Right.
Hi, you.
Hello.
Are you new around here?
Brand new.
Welcome.
Well, thanks.
Hello, Grandma.
Did I miss the parade?
What parade?
The one that usually arrives before you do.
That nice tour manager...
...and all those bodyguards,
and the reporters.
It's just me this time.
I hardly recognized you
without all that hair.
Did you quit?
It's just a short pause.
- How are you?
- Oh, hell, I'm fine.
I'd like to quit.
It's just gettin' bigger and bigger.
Startin' to look like a circus.
I saw you over in Dallas.
That was quite an extravaganza.
Why didn't you call me?
I'd have got you tickets
and you could've been backstage with me.
You were workin'.
You don't disturb men
when they're workin'.
Did you like it?
'Course I did.
It was you singin'.
I love to hear you sing.
But...
It was loud, and I couldn't hear the words.
Without the words, there's no song.
And...?
I could've done
without the smoke and the lights.
Yeah, me, too.
The kids liked it.
You kept my old guitar.
I learned to play on this old Dove.
I kept it around in case you might
want to play me a song sometime.
No smoke. No lights.
No amplifiers.
No big stage production.
Just me and my guitar.
Think anybody would buy that?
I would.
I'll see you soon.
Howdy.
Want a beer?
Yeah, I'll take a beer.
Is there a rent-a-car place
anywhere nearby?
Where you tryin' to get?
Louisiana. Shreveport.
I used to play in here years ago...
back when I was in high school.
Yeah, I know who you are.
You do?
Yes, sir.
I tell ya, the place hasn't changed much.
If you played here, you earned this.
It's on the house.
Thanks.
There is a General rent-a-car place
just down the road.
I appreciate it.
Dave, come in. Anything?
Nothing, Lula.
We have all the entrances watched.
I'm too old for this.
Hey, we can't hear it, man.
Will somebody please tell me where he is?
Put that thing away.
One of you must know.
Earl?
How many times you gonna ask me?
All right, look.
Dusty and I had a fight the other day.
And I said some things I shouldn't have.
And I'm sorry.
But I can't apologize to him
until one of you tells me where he is!
Are you cancellin' the show?
No, I'm not cancellin' the show.
There are 25,000 fans out there.
Some of them drove
hundreds of miles to get here.
And they're gonna get their show.
He'll be here.
Thanks, gentlemen.
Y'all been a real big help.
You're supposed to be out
on that stage in five minutes.
I suggest if you wanna keep your jobs,
you better get out there.
Dave...
Let's do it.
Dusty?
Bring the lights down really slowly.
More smoke. Now. Right now.
I think we got it.
Okay.
Good.
- Harley, honey. How about a little dance?
- Not now, Al.
Oh, come on.
Why are you always avoidin' me?
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm goin' home.
- Oh, come on.
- AI, leave me alone!
- Hold on. Where are you goin'?
- I'm going home.
- Come on back in.
- I don't want to. I'm going home.
I don't like you. Leave me alone!
- Leave her alone.
- What do you want?
- No, Al! Don't!
- Back off, cowboy!
There's no need to do this!
I said, back off!
Leave him alone.
Al, come on.
- You're botherin' the lady.
- Let go!
That's enough!
Why does he always do this to me?
Stop it!
- He started it.
- Leave him alone.
You should've stayed inside.
Leave him alone. That's enough!
- Stop it, now. Just stop it!
- Come on back in.
Harley, my hand!
- Want your hand?
- Open the door!
Oh, my nose!
Sorry. I'm sorry about your nose.
- It was a mistake.
- Leave me alone.
Why is this happenin' to me?
Kill the spot. Kill it.
Listen to me! Kill the spot.
Nice show.
When's Dusty gonna be ready
to give me the rest of that interview?
I've got a plane to catch
in about two hours.
I'm not gonna let Dusty
do the interview tonight.
He's been fightin' a sore throat
and I just wanna keep him quiet.
Come on. I just got a couple of questions.
It's no big deal.
Hey, Lula, good show, huh?
Can't do it.
My first responsibility is to Dusty.
I gotta go.
Wait a minute.
Take Mr. Louis to the airport.
See he's taken care of.
Catch you in Vegas, okay?
You are really startin' to wear me slick.
We're not playin' games. Get in
the bus before somebody sees your face.
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm goin' in this bus.
- No, that's Dusty's bus.
Well, tonight, I'm Dusty.
You don't want my fans
to get suspicious, do ya?
You don't belong in there.
Lula, you better get over here.
We have a problem.
Peckerhead.
What do you think?
We were real lucky.
If there was one glitch with the tape...
...if Bobby Louis had come
this much closer...
Hell, aren't you even gonna thank me?
Yes, of course!
Good. Then we can...
...we can go celebrate.
The guys in the band would like
to have a word with you.
Get him outta these clothes
before someone sees him.
Hell!
You guys were great tonight.
What the hell was Buddy Jackson
doin' out there?
Why didn't you just cancel the show,
rain check it or somethin'?
We can't play with a guy
who's lip-synching.
We change tempo, he can't follow us
or the audience will know.
Where is Dusty, anyway?
Buddy Jackson!
Have you lost your mind, Lula?
If I hadn't done what I did...
...all of those people
would have gone home mad.
And we...
...would all be out of a job.
Now I am sure that your ex-wives...
...and Henry's five kids
and Keith's mother...
...don't care if it was Buddy, Dusty...
...or King Kong up there on that stage,
so long as you get your paychecks.
You know I have always
taken care of you guys.
Now...
...we've got a little time off
before we get to the big show in Vegas.
Everything...
...will be straightened out.
Dusty will be back.
I'm gonna tell you something.
Promise me you will not say one word...
...to anybody
about what happened tonight.
This is for Dusty's sake.
And your own.
For Dusty's sake?
I'm sick to death of your crap.
You had him hung up
and twistin' in the wind.
He had nothin' to do with this.
Tonight was all you, Lula.
He had nothin' to do with this?
He walked out.
And he left you and me
and everyone sittin' on their thumbs.
- He had everything to do with it.
- You should have cancelled tonight.
I ain't gonna be a dancin' chicken
in your freak show.
Get yourself another drummer.
Earl...
Let's do it.
Why the hell not?
What day is this?
Friday.
Oh, my. The show.
You know horses?
I know a few.
I'm sorry. I was...
...a little drunk last night.
Yes, you were.
My name's Wyatt.
Well, Wyatt...
...you can't drink.
And you can't fight.
Can you eat?
Yeah, I think so.
Might as well have some breakfast...
...before you go.
Well, come on.
Excuse me.
You can sit over there.
Sure do appreciate your hospitality.
The hat.
Sure is good.
You were nearly three seconds long
on that pattern this morning.
I got in late.
Maybe you should just get in
a little bit earlier, you know.
We all need to win this time.
Why are you here?
- What are you doin' here?
- Come on, don't be like that.
Why do you have to start all this?
Go back in the truck, and go home!
Who was that guy last night?
I've never seen him around.
None of your business.
It's not like you know him or somethin'.
What's the deal?
You can't tell me what I can
and cannot do! Just go!
You made a mess of me last night!
Excuse me.
Why don't you just shoot me
and put me out of my misery.
I'm sorry about that.
It's okay, it's not about my nose.
I don't want you comin' here and tellin' me
what I can or can't do.
I am not tellin' you what to do.
You do it all the time! I'm tired of it!
- How long have we known one another?
- Don't start.
I'm not startin' nothin'.
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Just go back in the house. Go ahead.
Don't you remember that beatin'
you got last night?
Me?
You look like the one who took the beatin'.
Not by you. I whupped your ass.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.
What's the matter?
Were you too drunk to notice?
Stop it! Just stop it!
Stop it!
We were all drunk last night.
And I'm sure we're all sorry.
Come on, Al,
get in your truck and go home.
Why should I? This drunk is staying.
Look, honey...
The lady said to leave.
You're just beggin'
for another ass-whupping, aren't you?
Absolutely.
What're you doin'?
Just go back in the house. Go!
Oh, my nose!
Go back in the house!
My nose!
Just go!
My hand! Oh, God!
He busted my nose again.
Get my hat.
Sure is a beautiful ranch.
How many acres you got?
I can't blame you for keepin' quiet.
Kind of hard to get a word in edgewise
with those three.
Yes, sir.
People talk too darn much for my taste.
Yappin' about this and that
when they ought to be...
...eatin', workin' or sleepin'.
What's anybody say that everybody
doesn't already know anyway?
Can you tell me that?
No, sir, I can't.
That's too bad.
Take, for example, this morning.
We all know that Harley
was slow on her ride.
We know she was out late last night.
That's no front-page news.
So why talk about it?
I guess I see what you're sayin'.
You guess?
Never guess!
You got to know!
You got to know what you're doin'.
If you guess, you're leavin' yourself
wide open to suggestion.
And that to my mind is what's wrong
with this whole country.
It's goin' straight to hell.
Everybody's open to suggestion.
Well, are you comin'
or are you just gonna sit there?
How long have you known Harley?
Not very long.
- Thousand.
- Pardon?
Thousand acres.
Used to be more.
What happened?
Getting to be a business. I'm a rancher.
I don't want to be a businessman.
And taxes are getting harder to pay.
People want to buy us out.
Seems like we wind up selling it off,
bit by bit.
I'm kind of glad I won't be around
long enough...
...to see it all go.
And Harley?
Well, Harley thinks she's going to save it...
...by winnin' at the rodeo.
Would you excuse us for a minute, please?
You rope pretty good.
I've always wanted to learn
how to do that.
Good luck.
Any chance you'd give me lessons?
Did you hear that? This guy wants us
to give him ropin' lessons.
I'll pay.
In advance.
In advance?
Wonder if maybe you might want
to rent out that empty bunkhouse, too.
I could pay room and board.
Maybe stay a little while.
Take some ropin' lessons.
You want to buy a rope?
You mind tellin' me
why you can't stand still for one minute?
I just don't believe you're tellin'
our problems to a perfect stranger.
Our problems with this ranch
are none of his business.
If he's such a perfect stranger,
what are you doin' bringin' him home?
He got knocked out defending my honor.
Was I supposed to leave him
lyin' there on the ground?
If you hadn't liked him,
you sure would have.
I do not like him.
Then why is he makin' you so nervous?
I'll be right back.
What's he doin' on a horse?
Well, he bought it.
He what?
He's gonna be stayin' with us for a while.
For ropin' lessons and room and board.
He's payin'.
What's your problem?
You like him, don't ya?
Why does everybody keep sayin' that?
'"Lights and smoke swirling,
his voice particularly strong...
'"...Dusty delivered the performance of his
life last night in Shreveport auditorium.'"
Idiots!
They love me.
They think I'm better than Dusty.
Loved you?
They didn't even know it was you.
Thank God they didn't.
Maybe they should know that it's me.
You've got a lot of talent...
...and someday people are gonna be
spendin' a lot of money to see you.
These people paid to see Dusty.
So'd the people in Vegas
who bought tickets for the show.
And what happens if you don't find Dusty?
I will.
Grandma Ivy?
Who's there?
- Earl Blackstock.
- Who?
Earl Blackstock. Wyatt's friend.
You took us fishin'.
I know who you are.
I just couldn't hear you.
Why don't we go over here and sit down?
It's cooler over here.
You're lookin' well, ma'am.
Thank you. I'm feelin' pretty good.
The rain's doin' great things
for your flowers.
They are pretty this year.
He's not here.
Tell you the truth, Grandma,
I'm pretty worried about him.
He took off and...
He's got all this pressure and people
just tryin' to get a piece of him.
It ain't surprising.
But this one's different.
He missed a show and...
...that just ain't like him.
Well, sometimes...
...the tree grows too fast.
And the roots don't develop.
And sometimes...
...you have to chop off the top
of that tree to let the roots catch up.
But do you know where he's at?
I expect if you follow the roots,
you'll find him.
Grandma, in all the years I've known you,
I've never heard you answer directly.
There are no answers.
Only the search.
Whatever that means.
It was great seein' you.
You, too.
Take care now.
I will.
Drive careful.
Don't you leave home now
without seeing your mama.
Yes, ma'am.
No sign of Dusty.
Come in!
I'm not puttin' you off, I swear! Really!
Dusty's workin' on some new material
for the Vegas show...
...and he don't want to be disturbed
right now.
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.
All right. 'Bye.
- What's the problem now?
- It's Frankenstein.
He's sayin' we better take care of him
in case Dusty doesn't show up for Vegas.
This mornin' he asked me for a massage.
Come on, Lula...
I don't have to put up with that.
I don't work for him.
I know, I know, I know...
But you guys do work for me...
...and I want you to keep him
quiet and happy...
...just a few more days.
And I don't want him talkin' to anyone.
Understand?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm still not givin' him a massage.
What do you think?
Looks pretty nice, huh?
I think it'd look a whole lot better
without that price tag right there.
Decided to give Dusty a new look
for Vegas. Drop the cornball stuff.
Buddy, you are not goin' to Vegas.
Dusty will be back.
Dusty is a joke to people
on the cuttin' edges, a farce.
Since when do you know
anything about the cuttin' edge?
Since I talked to this reporter last night.
She wanted to know
the roadie's view of Dusty.
She said she thought
the whole show was passé.
Why are you doin' talkin' to a reporter?
She bought me a drink.
You know, I got to thinkin' afterwards...
...here I am savin' the day...
...yet I'm not gettin' anything.
No one even knows it's me.
No one's gonna know it, either.
- That was our agreement.
- I know.
But everything happened so fast,
I didn't have a chance to think it through.
I mean...
...I think I oughta get
a recording contract, at least.
And money.
How much money?
A hundred grand.
Hi, Sam.
No, Dusty's not going to be makin' it
down to the station this trip.
He's gonna be real disappointed, too.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna send you and the guys
some CDs.
Okay, you take good care.
A hundred grand?
You are out of your mind.
It would have been...
...awful easy to tell that pretty reporter
the whole story last night.
Don't you threaten me.
Can I get a cold one?
Does Pete Shanks still own this joint?
I'm gonna come down there myself
in the mornin'.
Just keep on him.
So you really can play that thing, huh?
Two horses?
He really needs a little exercise.
J.W. Usually helps me out,
but he's not up for ridin'.
- And Tim's still out doin' chores.
- So I guess I'm nominated.
Well, if you don't mind.
So how come a beautiful girl like you
isn't married?
Well, I almost did once.
What happened?
This good-lookin' stranger
came into town and...
...he said all the right things
and did all the right things.
And then he went back.
Back where?
To his wife.
You didn't know?
No, I didn't know.
- I'm sorry, that was stupid.
- No, it's all right.
I'm over it by now. It just...
It makes you wary, you know?
Hard to trust people.
I trust you, though.
Why?
Oh, I don't know. Just somethin' about ya.
You married?
No.
You ever been married?
No.
What the hell is that?
I don't know.
Hey, brother...
- You look like you're doin' all right.
- That's Earl.
This is Harley Tucker.
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
I'll take the horses.
You know, I hardly recognize you.
Clean-shaven...
...short hair. You look...
...pretty.
Younger.
I should've known you'd find me.
How'd you do it?
Somethin' to do with trees and roots.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Grandma Ivy.
So you've been playin' some?
You're a flat lying cur-dog, I tell you.
I guess you two
have played together before.
She doesn't know?
Earl and I played in a band
back in the old days.
Speakin' of the old days,
you'll never guess where I went.
That was quite a show
you two put on back at the ranch.
It was fun.
It was more fun
than I've had in a long time.
You're quite a talented man, Mr. Wyatt.
And you're quite a woman, Miss Harley.
I'll be right back.
What's the matter with you?
Haven't you ever been in love before?
You like dancin' with my husband?
Come on, we're going home.
What's wrong?
You son of a bitch!
How could you do it?
How could you stand there...
...and look me straight in the eye
and lie to me like that?
I just don't understand it. I trusted you.
We're goin'.
- What the hell is wrong?
- Don't! Don't!
I don't want to see you near anybody
in my family again!
Do you understand me?
No, I don't.
Oh, man.
It's time to come home.
That's me.
Underneath that Dusty hat, that's me.
Harley? This is Wyatt.
I can't believe you two.
Us two?
I swear to God, Wyatt...
...I had nothin' to do with it.
She must've had me followed or somethin'
after I walked.
Hell, you walked out. Went home.
I followed you...
...just like I always do.
How's I supposed to know
you didn't want to be found?
I didn't even know myself.
You should've made that show
in Shreveport.
I intended to.
Things happen.
Well, man...
...nobody missed you.
Lula just cranked up the fire
on another dancin' chicken.
I want to see Buddy Jackson.
Haven't found him yet.
Find him. Soon.
You're certainly good at that.
That Shreveport concert, I want you
to reschedule it. I'm gonna do it for free.
If we do that,
everyone will know you weren't there.
We can't let anyone know that.
You don't know what I went through
to save your ass.
Those people paid to see my show,
and that's what they're gonna get.
What choice did you give me,
disappearin' like that?
Forget about me.
You got a whole band with families
to support.
Did you think about them
on your little holiday?
They're the only reason I'm here.
What are we doin' out here?
Where are we goin'?
Just takin' a walk.
You know what happened
while I was gone?
I remembered I could still play a guitar.
And I can sing.
And I remembered I used to enjoy it.
And I'm good at it.
So that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna play the guitar and sing.
No more smoke.
No volcano blast.
And no more light shows.
Just gonna stand on that stage and sing?
Can the whole show?
That's right.
We've been doin' this for a long time.
You can do this with me...
...or I'll do it by myself.
That's it.
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
- What was that?
- That was me.
I wasn't concentrating.
I just can't concentrate, dammit!
Just forget about him, Harley.
He's no good.
You got a rodeo in three days in Vegas.
Get him out of your head.
I wish I'd broken his jaw.
Today, an entertainment exclusive.
It's Milli Vanilli in reverse.
A member of country superstar Dusty's
road crew reveals an amazing secret.
I impersonated the guy
throughout the whole concert.
The TV! Quick! Come here!
The band was live, but the voice
was on tape and I lip-synched to it.
His manager offered me a hundred...
Lula Rogers offered me $100,000 and
a recording contract if I'd keep doing it.
But she changed her mind?
Maybe she found somebody else.
There's no tellin' how many
different guys she used before me.
Where's the real Dusty?
I don't know.
Dusty ends his phenomenally successful
road tour this weekend...
...at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.
Country Music Network
will be there to answer the question:
"'Ls it Dusty, or is it Memorex?"'
This is Monique James,
Country Music Network...
...and we'll try once again
for an interview in a minute.
I owe all of you an apology.
I put each of you here in this room
in a difficult position...
...leavin' the way I did,
and for that I'm sorry.
I guess I...
...kind of lost track of...
...what our real job was.
Maybe we all did.
In the early days...
...it was all about the music.
We did it because we loved it.
Lately, it seems like it's just...
...for the smoke and the...
...glitz and the...
...money.
And it's real easy to get caught up in that.
I know I did.
I think we all did.
That's what happened to Buddy Jackson.
That's why he did what he did.
We got a lot of fans out there
who don't trust us anymore...
...and tonight I'd like to get that trust back.
I want to thank you all for coming in
and stayin' with me...
...and I'd like to see the band in my room
later on this afternoon.
I need to talk to you.
This has just been a big misunderstanding.
Harley told you
she don't want you around.
Can't you at least respect her that much?
She's told you once, don't come around.
She don't want you anymore.
You know...
...it's a funny thing about that white speck
on the top of chicken shit.
That little white speck is chicken shit, too.
Rodeo fans, as the competition's
been keen here in Las Vegas this week...
...remember the City of Neons
brings you the best rodeos in the world.
We've got cowboys and cowgirls
from all over the world, but...
...we've got a beautiful lady from
the state of Texas that'll be next to go:
Harley Tucker.
The time of 16.30 is what we're runnin'
after the bucket of the big bucks.
Here comes a pretty lady, Harley Tucker.
One turn to the right, two to the left.
Las Vegas, get ready to have
a Texas lady take the money home!
One more turn left
and we're gonna be there.
Off and running!
And the number: 16.30...
...and the mark
we've been looking for, 16.26!
That's what it's all about, folks. All right!
What'd you tell her?
I was just callin' you.
Dusty...
How you doin', Buddy?
I'm doin' great.
You're not so smart, are you?
How's that?
- This little charade you been pullin'.
- I don't know.
I'm gettin' an awful lot of media attention.
I barely keep reporters
from knockin' down my door.
I'm a pretty popular man.
Everybody knows who I am.
I'd say that's pretty smart.
Yeah, but I think you're forgettin'
a little somethin'.
Like what?
Like a little matter of fraud.
That fraud you been committin'
on 60,000 unsuspecting fans.
Especially when Lula offers you
all that money and a recording contract.
Come to think of it,
I think that qualifies as extortion.
Of course the only person
who'd have to press charges is me.
- She didn't give me any money.
- What?
You mean you've been lyin' to the press?
Hold on, Dusty.
No, you hold on.
I want you to disappear, Buddy.
If I ever hear of you
makin' another comment to the press...
...if I ever see your face
around country music again...
...Ill sue you so fast you won't believe it.
Now go on.
Get your ass out of here.
Can he do that?
Yeah.
Go on.
Get your ass out of here.
This isn't over yet.
Yeah, it is.
Thanks.
Harley Tucker.
I've got some tickets for you.
- Tickets?
- Who is it?
I'll pick you up in the limousine at 7:00.
- Limousine? You got the wrong room.
- There must be some mistake here.
Are you the Tuckers?
Harley, J.W., Tim and Ernest?
- Yeah.
- No mistake.
We're live at the Mirage Hotel
in Las Vegas...
...where recent allegations
by former staff member, Buddy Jackson...
...have left Dusty fans in a turmoil.
We were unable to speak with Dusty,
but his long-time manager, Lula Rogers...
...promised he is here and he is ready
to give the best Dusty show ever.
Look at these seats!
Enjoy the show.
Are you Miss Harley Tucker?
Could you come with me, please?
Someone would like to speak with you.
I'll be back.
Mrs. Chandler?
I hope your ride from the airport
was all right.
Just fine, thank you.
Shorter the ride, the longer the car.
Showbiz.
What's goin' on?
Wyatt, I know this doesn't...
...change anything...
...but I just wanted to apologize.
Next to Earl, Lula, you're my oldest friend.
You're due a few mistakes.
Knock 'em dead!
Let's do it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the Mirage Hotel and Casino
proudly present:
Dusty.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I gotta do something a little different
tonight, so if you'll indulge me this...
...Ill appreciate it very much.
Could you follow me with the spotlight
right down here in front please?
