Imagine, there was a time when
the whole world looked like this.
Imagine there
was another paddle...
And long after we're gone,
this thing will still be here.
It'd better be,
it cost enough. Hey...
Pass me a sandwich.
- What's on it?
- Roast beef...
- Monster.
- And mustard. Fucking Dijon, baby!
"Baby"?
Where did you get Dijon anyway?
Oh, I know a guy who might know a guy
who knows another guy who basically...
knows me.
- Shit!
- What?
For fuck's sakes, Gabi.
How far out?
About two k's,
but there was a guy.
- I'll go get it.
- No, we've still got four more cameras to check.
Just drop me. I'll meet you
in the next valley.
- People disappear in this forest.
- Come on, Winston.
They were crusty old hippies. They
probably just moved on to their next squat.
Sometimes you're just
like those whiteys.
"Danger!"
"Where? Oh, let me go see."
We can't just leave
our trash here.
One hour.
Winston, come in. Over.
Winston, come in.
Oh fuck!
Winston... I need help.
Fuck.
Shit!
Gabi, copy. Over.
Fuck.
Gabi!
Gabi!
Gabi?
Gabs?
Gabs?
Oh!
Come on!
Gabs?
Hello?
Fuck.
Hurry.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- Shh... Who sent you?
My name is Gabi Pekeur. Please...
Please, they're looking for me.
You broke our trap.
It's okay...
What the fuck?
Who are you?
Barend.
You from the city?
Forestry Station.
How many of you out there now?
Two.
Elephant?
Just the one old cow.
What's your name?
Stefan.
He doesn't speak much.
Porcini...
Costs a fortune
in your fancy restaurants.
Winston, come in.
Winston, come in.
Where are you? Are you okay?
Over.
Asshole.
Gabi...
Winston? Where are you?
I'm...
- Winston!
- What is this?
Winston, what?
Hey!
Winston, are you there?
Is anybody there?
He's intelligent.
- He should be learning.
- He is learning.
Bone cancer. Thirteen years now.
Collateral damage.
And what did you use to do?
I was a scientist,
plant pathology.
But after Lily...
Something to remember us by.
Shh...
What the fuck?
It's a fungus.
Seems to prefer Homo sapiens.
It feeds on the eyes,
the mouth, the lungs.
First it grows down, saves the muscles
for later, connects to the fungal network,
filling up with spores
until it's ready to...
repeat itself.
And so...
finally, the apes
return to the trees.
What in God's name
are you talking about?
The largest organism on the planet
lives right here, underneath us.
Older than human history,
it's been growing...
waiting, ripening.
And it's ready to spread.
To see the future of
humanity, observe monkeys in captivity.
Aggressive hoarding
of limited resources,
asserting hierarchies
through sexual violence.
Every day, the human habitat
resembles more closely a cage.
Hey...
Gabi?
Please...
Kill... me.
No.
I can get you to the hospital.
Stefan!
You don't believe me, but you
believe in a central nervous system
which promises you that it's
the only intelligence on Earth?
Three hundred years ago we
started the Industrial Revolution.
Nothing less than
a declaration of war.
And she's losing.
So you're saying
this is intentional?
That's the difference
between science and...
Madness?
Faith.
- Long enough to taste joy.
- Mm... It's all about sex for your kind.
Vermin children surviving on
the scraps of a decaying world.
The human race is standing
on the first of many tipping points...
...unwilling to change,
and ready to destroy itself.
All it needs is a nudge.
We're about to witness the
greatest reckoning of all time.
