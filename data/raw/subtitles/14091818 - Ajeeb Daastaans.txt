LOVER
Our fathers are
quite happy with this marriage.
After all,
it's a profitable deal for them.
But I've always loved someone else,
so I won't be able to love you.
I won't allow my father
to be a grandfather,
so don't expect anything from me.
I won't apologize
because in such marriages
everyone has to compromise.
You understand.
Then why did you marry me?
I wasn't given a choice.
So what do you expect from me, then?
To uphold
our families' reputation, that's all.
Why are men
in this country such hypocrites?
If you guys can cheat, you should
have the guts to be cheated on.
If I had guts, there'd be
someone else here in your place.
So now I'm supposed to suffer
all my life for your lack of courage?
Look at me.
Happy birthday, Lipakshi.
How do you know it's my birthday?
Because I'm crazy about you.
I know everything.
Your age is 25. Zodiac sign, Scorpio.
And your favorite color is green.
I even have a gift for you.
What is it?
Why are you being so shy? Tell me.
It's a sexy nightie.
Just like they wear
in those English movies.
And it's green.
Please put it on. It'll be so hot,
I swear on my mother's life.
If Babloo comes to know,
he'll put you through some serious pain.
He's gone to Lucknow to meet his uncle.
Tonight there's no pain, only gain.
Please, Lipakshi, dear. Please.
Thank you, Lipakshi.
A dying man's last wish
should always be fulfilled.
-You fucking piece of shit!
-Gopal, sir.
-How dare you!
-Gopal, sir.
Babloo, sir…
I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me.
You call me sir
and then you try to screw my wife.
I messed up, sir. I'm so sorry.
-I'll show you, motherfucker!
-I don't wanna die.
-I don't wanna die, sir!
-Cut off his head.
Won't you wish me a happy birthday?
How do I look?
Stop acting so promiscuous.
Then do something about it,
so that I won't act like that.
Someday I'm going to kill you myself.
Use your hands.
I don't trust your gun.
It's prone to misfire.
No! I don't want to die! Please!
I'll leave Bara Banki
and never come back, I promise.
Please forgive me, sir.
The oil will burn me.
Now listen to me, you dickhead.
Oil has to be hot enough
to fry meat, you get that?
I swear on my mother's life, sir.
I'll never even look at your wife again.
Why not?
In fact, I want you to look at her
with your hungry, lustful eyes everyday.
So that when you do,
your fried little sausage reminds you
of what it means in Bara Banki
to put your eyes on Babloo's wife.
-Lower him.
-Sir. Please forgive me, sir.
Sir!
-Later, then.
-No!
Lower.
Sir, namaste.
Mishra.
-How's everything?
-All good, sir.
Sir…
Sweets? What's the occasion?
Sir, with your blessings,
my son Raj just got a job
at a bank in London.
He'll earn 1.5 million a year.
-1.5 million.
-Yes, sir.
Isn't his name Raj Kumar?
It is. But ever since
he went to Mumbai for college,
he chucked the Kumar out of Raj Kumar.
What's wrong with "Raj Kumar"?
He thinks it doesn't suit his personality.
Whereas Raj sounds pretty cool.
So is this cool guy
coming to Bara Banki or…
He's on his way.
His friends have gone to pick him up.
-Ask him to come to the mansion.
-Okay, sir.
Hello.
Where the hell are you?
I'll show him how cool he is.
-Gopal, sir.
-Yes.
What do I have to do
to look as good as him?
Wait for another life.
-Sir.
-Babloo, sir.
-Hello.
-How are you, Raj?
-I'm good.
-Sir, it's Raj Kumar.
No. Just Raj is fine.
Suits him better.
Thanks.
Thanks to you, sir,
I now have a job in London.
What did I do?
You've kept my father
on your payroll for 30 years.
Even paid his hospital bills
when he broke his leg.
-I was the one who broke it.
-He made a mistake.
You have the right.
I've got a Rolex for you.
You didn't have to.
You've given so much to my family.
And I believe that
when you take something from someone,
you should always return the favor.
Won't you give me anything?
I'm Lipakshi. Babloo's wife.
Hello, ma'am.
Don't call me ma'am.
Not everyone needs to call me ma'am.
Sir's wife deserves respect
from everyone in this town,
state and the entire country.
You could have said that
while looking at me.
The only person
who's entitled to do that is Mr. Babloo.
That's exactly the issue.
He doesn't really know
what to do with that entitlement.
-Sir, I should go now.
-No.
Breakfast is already set.
Mishra, you can leave.
Raj will come later.
Sir, have a paratha. It's hot.
-Thank you.
-Some pickle?
Just get the damn pickle.
I've been asking for it since forever.
You'll go there and become
a slave to white people again.
Work for us. You're like family.
-My job there has already been confirmed.
-So?
Tell them you changed your mind.
Nobody's gonna shoot you.
-You're getting 1.5 million there, right?
-Yeah.
We'll…
give you 2.5.
Sir, it's not about the money.
You do know finance, right?
Or did you cheat to get your degree?
I topped at the university.
You'll be amazed to see
how I'll double your money.
Okay, it's final, then.
From this day on, you're mine.
Okay, sir.
From today, I'm yours.
Eat.
Do you work out?
Yes, ma'am.
Even we have a little gym
here in our mansion.
You can use it if you want to work out.
Thanks, ma'am, but I work out at home.
You could invite me over then.
Are you out of your mind?
Now you'll become Babloo's servant?
Like father, like son.
You were his servant
all your life. I'm just following you.
I did it because
I didn't have any other option.
Why'd I pay for your education?
I did it so you could get out
of this cesspool and take us with you.
You can leave. I'm staying here.
Do you see my limping leg?
This is all thanks to Babloo.
You crashed
his new Mercedes into a planter.
What else should he have done?
I can't believe this.
You're taking his side?
That's because
the real moolah lies on his side.
Instead of 1.5, I'll get 2.5.
Have you seen that much money?
Yes, I have. Many times.
I've also seen how people get ruined
when they keep running after money.
-Bravo!
-Hey! Shut up.
I didn't force you to get married
so that I don't have to butt heads
with a daughter-in-law.
Let me watch my TV show in peace?
-Sorry, Mom.
-Get out of here.
Mishra, warm my dinner.
-I told you to get an expensive one.
-Here you go.
And where the hell were you?
Hey.
Yeah, right.
Here you snatch my cigarette,
and there you put a Rolex in Babloo's ass.
Your ass is too small
for a Rolex, isn't it?
Should I try a lollipop?
Shut up. Bloody freeloaders.
Vibhishan, the Rolex is fake.
Anyway, what's with that Lipakshi?
-You mean ma'am?
-Ma'am for you, not for me.
Give me the information.
She hails
from a political family in Hardoi.
Babloo's father funded
her father's political campaign,
helped him become an MLA.
Then forced her into marrying Babloo
and handed him a liquor license.
But one thing's for sure…
the marriage is totally on the rocks.
-And why's that?
-Children, of course.
It's been years since
they got married and still no child.
Does Babloo Junior manage
to give a standing ovation?
I don't know what Babloo Junior does,
but, yes, I do know
that Babloo Senior can screw your ass.
Stay away from her or you'll be screwed.
-Really?
-Really.
Collection network is set.
Every day they are counting.
The cash generated yearly is 100 million.
From land and liquor.
All this money is invested
in builders and property.
The yearly returns is at 15%.
Gopal has helped raise me.
He has handled all my business till now.
Sir, I have something to say.
Dealing in cash is now old school.
Returns are less,
and the government
is looting rich people for votes.
Now it's time to turn
all this black money into white.
Are you out of your mind?
Those income tax guys will come after us.
They won't.
Your money will be moved
through offshore accounts.
We'll invest in London
and New York stock exchanges.
We'll invest in hedge funds.
You know what hedge funds are?
Hedge funds. I know.
We'll get minimum 30% returns.
I'll get the paperwork started.
Good.
He speaks such fluent English.
That bugger
is fooling us with all his English.
I also know. Fuck.
What are hedge funds?
You never mentioned them.
Sir, I don't think this is a good idea.
When are you going to
stop pretending and look at me properly?
Hello, ma'am.
This naive act of yours,
keep it aside for Babloo.
He can be fooled, not me.
Why have you come here?
Why have you come here?
I wanted some water.
From my glass?
I'm not talking about the house.
I'm talking about my life.
-Why have you come into my life?
-It wasn't me.
I was supposed to go to London.
It was Mr. Babloo who stopped me.
And you let him do that so easily?
Wow.
Quite obedient you are.
Ma'am, please maintain distance.
Someone might see us.
Let them.
You are from a good family.
You are Mr. Babloo's wife.
This disgraceful behavior
doesn't suit you.
Quiet!
You're all the same.
Ever since you've arrived,
you keep staring at me.
You drink water from my glass,
and you talk about disgrace and stature?
You don't need to remind me
that I'm Babloo's wife.
The loneliness I feel
in this house is enough of a reminder.
I came to you looking for a companion,
but you're not even worthy
of being called a stranger.
Sir.
If you don't mind, can I say something?
You should leave ma'am.
She's not the right kind of woman.
If I could,
I would have done it a long time ago.
Her father is an MP.
If she goes, then I go down.
Ma'am.
Yes, Raj.
-Hi, sir.
-Hi.
I'm sorry
I've called so late in the night.
I have a fever.
I can't even manage to stand.
Can I take a leave tomorrow?
Yes, get some rest.
You have to travel to Lucknow.
I'll send Vibhishan.
I'll go on my own.
Okay, I'll tell Krishna.
He'll come to pick you up.
-Yes, okay. Take care.
-Okay.
Good night, sir. Thank you.
You bugger.
Why should I take him to Lucknow?
Because you look like a driver.
Your father's a driver,
dickhead. Not mine.
But you're the one
who looks like my father's son.
Did Auntie ever
pay our house a visit? Tell me.
Friend, companion, enemy…
Make me whatever you want me to be.
Just don't make me a stranger.
What if I raise an alarm?
Please go ahead.
Now that Babloo is away,
you've suddenly become Romeo?
The day you decide you're ready,
this Romeo
can even make you elope with him.
I don't trust evading eyes.
How dare you look into my eyes?
The whole country
should call me ma'am, right?
Am I not Mr. Babloo's wife?
I'm bad luck.
Whoever comes close to me dies.
Death is fine for me.
One, two. Yes.
One, Two. Jump.
-Sir.
-One, two.
Sir?
-Sir, you've become quite lazy.
-What the…
Sorry, sir.
-I'll show you how lazy I am.
-Sorry, sir, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
You're such a bitch.
You were making me jealous
back there with Babloo.
If I'm a bitch, then you're a bastard.
Will you run away with me?
After I got married to Babloo…
I had lost all hope from life.
And then you came into my life.
Now it feels like
I also have the right to be happy.
To start a new family.
To be able to live again.
Do you love me?
You do, right?
Yeah.
I love you, Raj.
I've booked two tickets
for the day after tomorrow.
Reach the railway station by 4:00.
-This mail arrived today for you.
-Here, keep this inside.
Okay, sir.
-Done?
-Yes.
Raj, you'll come with us.
But, sir, I have to drop off
my parents at the bus station.
-Drop them and come to the farm.
-I'll bring him there.
-Raj, come alone.
-Okay, sir.
Okay, you go.
-Take care of Mom.
-Go, you go.
Sir.
Don't call me that.
I'm not your sir.
Why do you say that?
-You'll always be that.
-Because I don't want that.
I want something else from you.
Sorry. It's just that…
I've fallen in love with you.
I didn't think this would happen…
but it did.
I love you, Raj.
-Sir--
-Don't call me that.
Okay.
Babloo.
Can you say that one more time?
Babloo.
He…
He called me by my name, too.
"Aye, Babloo."
Ashish Pandey.
We were in love with each other.
We were planning
to run away from Bara Banki.
Somehow my father came to know…
And that very night…
Ashish and his entire family were gone.
I don't even know if he's alive.
And then my father,
in order to save his honor,
forced me to get married.
I could never love Lipakshi.
Even though it wasn't her fault.
I never gave my father the satisfaction
of being a grandfather till the end.
Can you do me a favor?
After marrying Lipakshi,
I was never attracted to anyone.
Never expressed my feelings.
I let her off the hook for every mistake
she made. But… not for this one.
Raj, kill Lipakshi.
If her father wasn't a powerful man…
But I won't let anything happen to you.
I'll be with you forever.
Will you do it?
I've been alone
for a long time, Raj. Very alone.
I found out that Gopal and ma'am
are planning to run away together.
You take care of Gopal.
I'll kill ma'am at the station.
Be careful.
Just make sure nothing happens to you.
I'll be fine.
So what do you expect from me, then?
To uphold
our families' reputation, that's all.
You were always like my son!
How could I have done this?
That is why!
Babloo, sir.
Gopal is innocent. Let him go.
Now that you've seen the video.
You broke my father's leg for no reason.
-Which of your feet slipped, Mr. Mishra?
-I'm sorry, sir.
Babloo, sir! Sir, please!
That was the day I took an oath
that one day I'll take my revenge.
Out of your colossal wealth,
I've siphoned off only five million.
Which you and Gopal
will never be able to trace.
By the time you watch this video,
me and my family
will have left this country.
Lipakshi and you
have given me a lot of love.
I'll always be grateful for that.
I once told you…
use your hands to kill me.
I don't trust your gun.
I'm pregnant.
I had told you
when I take something
from someone, I always return the favor.
Yours lovingly, Raj Kumar Mishra.
TOY
What's your name?
Binny.
-Can you speak louder?
-Binny.
Binny.
Which school do you go to?
Rani Lakshmi Bai Inter College.
You study in an inter college?
No.
Why not?
Why don't you study
in an intermediate college?
I'm too young, that's why. Fourth grade.
You don't seem that young.
Hey. Go away.
Sister will be here soon.
No, she won't.
Neighborhood people have
told her not to hang around here.
You get lost, too.
They also told you not to set up
your stall here, didn't they?
Hey! You've got a sharp tongue.
And there's leakage in you shop.
Leakage? What do you mean?
Water leakage.
I'll burn you sisters someday!
I've heard that you're quite mischievous.
No, I'm not.
Come on, you're bluffing.
Be honest.
Okay, maybe sometimes.
So what kind of mischief do you get into?
I sometimes pour water into Sushil's iron.
Really?
Then he must be quite angry at you, right?
He says he'll burn us.
Where's my sister?
How come you're panting so much?
I just poured water into Sushil's iron.
What did he say then?
He said he'll burn us.
He said that?
Burn us?
Meenal?
Shoes outside!
How many times have I told you
to leave your shoes outside!
-Why don't you get it?
-That's enough.
Look at this! She never listens to me!
I just cleaned it and she stained it!
-How hard the child is hit.
-Go on.
Get the clothes from the terrace. Go!
You hit me too hard today.
-You want her to give you food?
-Will she?
After seeing you
get that beating? She sure will.
-What's for lunch today?
-Eggplant.
They eat eggplant every other day.
That's why they're not able to have kids.
If they do, it'll look like an eggplant.
Fold them.
I've kept aside
some food for you, child. Go eat.
Ma'am, you shouldn't give her food.
She'll finish all of your eggplant.
Look at this cute, innocent child.
How could you hit her like that?
It didn't hurt too bad, did it?
-Ma'am?
-Yes?
We don't have electricity anymore.
The neighborhood people
have cut off our illegal power connection.
There's nothing
but darkness in our lives now.
She can't read, she can't sleep.
Would you please talk
to the neighborhood people about this?
Vinod Agarwal is
the neighborhood's new secretary.
You should talk to him.
Which Vinod Agarwal?
B-16. His wife is pregnant.
I've been knitting this sweater
for their expected baby.
He's the one who wears dark glasses
and rides a motorcycle. Talk to him.
If he agrees, he can get
your power working.
Okay.
Isn't that so? Take it.
-Sister, I swear on Binny.
-Stop calling me sister.
Sorry.
Ma'am, we're poor people.
-So are many people in this country.
-Please--
-Stop it!
-Sorry, ma'am.
Our father left us after Binny was born.
Our mother died.
We were left all by ourselves.
I somehow manage to earn enough to send
her to school. I've not done anything.
Meenal, if our senior officer
sees you crying like this,
then he'll surely think you're a criminal.
Stop crying. Give straight answers.
Manju.
Did she say anything?
What's going on between Sushil and you?
What luck!
Yeah, whatever.
What luck!
You're such a bitch!
-Hey!
-Bitch!
You're calling me a bitch?
I'll bite you then.
Should I bite you? Should I?
I'm here.
-Did you bring coal?
-Coal?
You didn't ask me to get coal.
You forgot?
To burn us.
They'll take away my stall.
If you love your stall so much,
stay there. Why come here?
My hands are aching.
So are mine, after washing
all those kitchen utensils.
And so are mine,
after doing all that homework.
Don't worry.
-I'll massage your hands.
-No need for all this.
If us coming to your stall
bothers you so much,
then you shouldn't be here either.
That motherfucker Agarwal
tells me that I fool around with women.
-Who's Agarwal?
-Vinod Agarwal.
He's the new secretary.
I told him I don't fool around with women,
but he said
I shouldn't even joke around with them
as it doesn't look good
for the neighborhood.
He cursed at me so much.
He's threatening to
close down my stall. What will I do?
What do I do?
It's okay. Calm down. Relax.
Calm down.
Can I mess up your hair?
Yes, you can.
You're overdoing it.
You're orphans, but you're teaching
your sister to fool around with men?
Screwing around with that laundry guy?
No, ma'am.
I go to his stall
to deliver people's clothes.
What time did he leave Agarwal's house?
-When?
-The day of the incident.
-What time did he leave Agarwal's house?
-I don't remember, sister.
You both sought pleasures of the flesh.
Now you'll get your flesh ripped.
-Sister…
-Move!
Move. Straight ahead.
When did you
start working at Agarwal's house?
How many times have I told you
not to come here?
You should get away from here.
I'm not leaving without meeting Agarwal.
He has said multiple times
that you shouldn't hee-haw over here.
-Am I doing that?
-What does "hee-haw" mean?
This. It means this.
See? There's your hee-haw.
He always has his eyes on me.
Not on you. He always has his eyes on me.
Utter nonsense you speak.
Hey, you done with the clothes?
No, sir, they'll be done in an hour.
You should be focusing
on your trade and not the maid.
Congratulations.
-What for?
-You're going to be a father, right?
Congratulations.
Abha didi told me.
She's knitting
a blue sweater for your baby.
Wasn't that supposed to be a surprise?
You ruined it.
Surprise, in English, means unexpected.
You get what I mean?
Like you're crossing a road and suddenly
a truck comes at you unexpectedly.
-Then you get a surprise.
-Yes, you got it.
But how exactly
did I ruin a surprise for you?
You just told me
about the blue sweater, didn't you?
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
What did she say?
She studies in a government school.
Becoming more of a rascal lately.
I want to put her in a better school.
Been looking for more work
so I can do that.
Come to my house tomorrow morning.
I'll introduce you to my wife.
Okay.
Focus.
I had to cough.
Yes. Let's call it a day.
This neighborhood
is filled with such idiots.
A woman who can't bear children
is knitting sweater
for someone else's baby.
And someone who's having a baby
is more excited
for a surprise sweater than the baby.
These people give you clothes,
fruit and food to eat.
You're talking shit about them.
That huge gate and the guard outside it,
who are they meant to stop?
People like us.
So we can't ever get into their palaces.
Those people living
in mansions can never be our friends.
Sons of bitches shut off our power.
Let it go. It doesn't matter. Happens.
Why doesn't it matter?
She had gotten used to
falling asleep watching TV.
Used to leave the TV on
when she went to sleep.
Colorful lights falling on her eyes from
the TV used to give her colorful dreams.
Those people won't let you reconnect
your illegal connection.
If Vinod Agarwal decides to,
he can make it happen.
He won't do anything fishy.
He has a wife at home.
I'll do all the cleaning
in two, three hours and get out.
Let him stare at me if he wants to.
If he tries anything more than that,
I'll print a hot iron on his face.
You're not any less of a fool.
If that ain't the truth.
Meenal, cut these vegetables.
Okay, ma'am.
Meenal, what are you doing?
Ma'am, actually we don't have electricity.
The neighborhood people disconnected
our power. Could you have a word with sir?
I will.
Come on, tell me everything you know.
What, sir?
Everything that happened
at his house. Quick, there's no time.
-Sir, how would I know that?
-Why?
Meenal didn't tell you anything?
As of now, it's only
Sushil's screams that you can hear.
Start talking or else
you'll soon hear Binny scream, too.
I haven't done anything.
You should question that bitch Abha.
She's infertile.
She must have been jealous.
I haven't done anything at all.
-It's really beautiful.
-You can use it later.
Offer her first.
You left our house to work over here.
It's because she's pregnant.
Needed more attention.
When you get pregnant,
I'll work for you again.
My darling, my golden boy.
Let me give you a massage.
Oil.
Oil massage, oil massage.
Oh, my darling son.
Such a beautiful baby.
Little Agarwal.
Such a pretty little baby.
When I go to sleep,
what exactly do you and Sushil do?
Nothing.
Hey. That's a lie.
How do you know
what's true and what's not?
-You're asleep by then, aren't you?
-How can I sleep without the TV on?
Do you want to have a baby, too?
I'll whack you so hard,
you'll see colorful lights without the TV.
-Now sleep.
-Why?
Weren't you crying
all those tears watching that baby?
What baby?
They make me clean all that shit and piss,
and the only reason they
even hold their baby is to play with it.
It's not their baby,
it's just a toy for them.
Yes.
We're all prepared for the function.
Stop worrying.
Don't go on shopping
for too long, it'll tire you.
Yes. I'm with the baby.
Come home soon.
Listen.
You need electricity?
-Yes.
-I'll get it done.
No need to worry.
Thank you.
You'll dry all these clothes by yourself?
Let me help you with that.
You should be with the baby.
-It's okay, let me help.
-No, I'll do it.
Binny, keep playing
with the baby. Shake that. Yes.
Take care of the baby, okay?
There.
You got hurt.
You want the electricity or not?
You want it, right?
Meenal, what happened?
Will you please tell me what happened?
Sushil, you motherfucker.
I've told you not to
let people loiter around over here.
Don't you get it?
What are you staring at?
What are you staring at, you bastard?
We let you put up your stall here,
and you create a nuisance for us.
Fucking imbecile!
Take this.
I'll teach you a lesson today.
Fucker!
Mr. Agarwal, stop it.
What are you doing? Stop it, Mr. Agarwal.
What are you doing, Mr. Agarwal?
Let me go.
Look at that little girl, she's seven.
She has no idea
what this man's intentions are, does she?
Are you okay, child?
We're having the function tonight.
Come over.
Help my wife with things.
You come, too.
Okay?
Come here.
Now look…
when I tell you something,
you better listen.
I say everything for a reason. Get it?
Come over in the evening.
Have some snacks.
Go on now.
Can we play a game?
It's working!
What's this?
Haven't you seen me cry before?
"Such a beautiful baby.
What a pretty baby."
"Little Agarwal baby."
"My baby."
These tears aren't like those ones?
And what are those ones like?
Bitch tears!
Motherfucker!
Son of a bitch.
So you don't know anything?
Nothing at all?
I have done nothing, sir.
All I did was blow up the transformer.
I'll make you feel sorry, you fucker.
Vinod Agarwal groped Meenal, sir!
That motherfucker groped Meenal!
No. What the hell?
Here we're celebrating the light
of our lives, and it just went dark.
He talks without thinking.
-Where's our light, our Chirag?
-Right here.
Check if he's okay.
-He's not here.
-What do you mean?
Abha?
Where is he?
Where's our son? Does somebody have him?
He was here only…
-Get me a flashlight.
-Did you see him?
Sunita mausi, is he with you?
Do any of you have him with you?
Munna, munna.
Where's my son? Where is he? Move aside.
Vinod Agarwal had groped Meenal
on the same day.
Both of them think
of the other as their toy.
Both of whom?
The rich, and then these ones.
The ones who steal electricity.
HAZRATGANJ POLICE STATION
LUCKNOW
She's here.
Please come.
Please come.
That's her! She's the one!
It's because of her
that we're getting accused!
She's the one who killed that baby!
She's barren! Bloody bitch!
I know you did it!
Shut your mouth!
Show me your bag, child.
Your bag.
You took this from the baby.
It wasn't their baby.
It was just their toy.
SLOPPY KISSES
Bhupesh!
The manager is here! Get to work!
But who's that madam over there?
Bharti.
Learn from her.
She's the one
they were talking about yesterday.
There goes your dream job.
Sir.
Sir, you said
the data operator job wasn't available.
Then why did you hire that girl?
I have the same degree.
I gave the right answers in my interview.
Sure. You gave the right answers.
You're qualified, too. There are
many factors when it comes to hiring.
Sir, I got 74% in B. Com.
I'm very good at accounting, too, sir.
Can you work on Tally?
And Excel?
I can learn it in a week, sir.
Bharti, is there a better machine-man
than you on the entire floor?
You know what separates
you from these men?
They're all workers.
And you're a craftsman.
Don't get wrapped up in all this.
Soon you'll be promoted
to a shift supervisor.
So I can't get the data operator job?
It's time for my morning prayer.
We'll talk about this later. Now get out.
How long does it take
to learn Excel and Tally?
Three days? Four days?
A week at most?
Even if you learn all that,
you won't get the job.
What do you mean?
Why can't I get the job?
Say something.
Is it because I don't
wear makeup like her?
-I have a degree, too, you know.
-Because you're Bharti Mandal.
Do you have a privileged-caste surname
like Banerjee or Sharma?
We are Dalits.
Did you forget that for a moment?
They'll allow us to eat at a table,
but they won't let us work at one.
Don't fight for what can't be yours
or they'll burn you up in flames.
To hell with your fear, Dashrath.
Please come, madam. This is the canteen.
Hello. Priya Sharma.
It's my first day at work.
Would you like some stuffed okra?
Where do you go when you have to pee?
Where everyone goes.
But how can women go there?
Do you see any women here?
You?
Sit down.
Miss Priya, you coming
down here feels like…
a goddess has descended upon us.
Look, India has progressed so much,
and yet there isn't
a single woman in this factory.
Don't look at her.
If you stare too long,
you'll see a beard sprouting on her face.
Get back, Bhupesh.
She works her hands on machines all day.
She only has her hands to satisfy herself.
Motherfucker.
Have you gone mad?
How can you hit her like that?
She threw water at me!
-And you…
-Stop it. Don't you have manners?
-Bharti.
-Ma'am, stop.
No, no, no.
You had it coming.
Take her away.
Behaving like such a creep,
I'd say he deserves a few more slaps.
I had warned him many times.
Are you okay?
-Yes, sir.
-Who started the fight?
Sir, that long-haired man was being--
Sir, it's just…
Let it be.
Why do you do this?
It happens in every few months.
If you had hurt your hands,
who'd pay for the idle machines?
Tell me.
Be careful.
Why didn't you say anything?
You are Kavita.
What?
Kavita was my childhood friend.
We were in high school
and the Holi festival was on.
As she was about to sit,
I kept a red water balloon on her seat.
Her white skirt and panties
turned totally red.
She was screaming in horror.
Poor thing.
But she didn't complain, just like you.
She spent all day with a sweater
tied around her waist. Stupid girl.
Your name's Bharti, right?
Bharti…
Banerjee.
You have beautiful eyes.
I should leave now.
Yeah, I need to finish
my joining formalities, too.
I'll see you later.
Murli.
What are you eating?
Come on. I'll feed you.
Come here.
What happened?
So you pooped outside
Auntie Dwivedi's house again?
Why?
Why did you do it?
Tell me. Don't you understand?
Haven't I told you 100 times not to do it?
All you want is food.
No, you're not getting any.
-Not on video. Witch.
-Why?
All the boys do it.
So you know what stuff boys do?
I do. Can I show you?
-Can I?
-Show me.
Witch. Not on video.
What shall I do?
Pack you in a suitcase
and take you to Delhi with me?
Are you asleep?
Please come.
Miss Bharti.
Do you always walk home?
-Yes.
-I live nearby, too.
About ten minutes by rickshaw,
and fifteen minutes walking.
But the Sharmas' daughter-in-law
can't be seen walking on streets.
Can I drop you home?
Well, I'm not a Sharma daughter-in-law.
Don't worry. I won't cling on to you.
I won't ask everyday.
Just for today. Come on.
Is it some special occasion?
I'm really craving some dahi vada today.
Come on.
Don't put ginger powder in hers.
And make mine really spicy.
Thank you.
That's for you.
So you were telling me,
who are your friends?
Friends?
-Dashrath.
-Not like him.
I mean… your best friend.
Like Kavita, whose skirt
and panties you turned red?
OMG! Such dirty talk in public?
You know, Kavita and I loved
riding around on my scooter in college.
Once during our exams,
we were up studying all night.
So in the morning I said,
"Let's go for a ride."
She sat behind me
and fell asleep
like a baby on my shoulder.
I didn't have the heart to wake her up,
so I rode the scooter around
for an hour and a half
just so she could
remain blissfully asleep.
And then, it ran out of petrol.
We dragged the scooter
around for four kilometers.
And instead of being grateful,
she shouted at me.
Witch.
You call her a witch?
That's what I used to call her.
Not anymore.
Now she doesn't even take my calls.
She got married and flew away.
I guess someone else
gets to call her a witch now.
-Didn't you try to contact her again?
-I did.
I even went to her office to surprise her.
She got mad at me.
She said, "Grow up,
we're not in college anymore."
She said, "You're married,
and you still want to frolic
on a scooter with pompoms."
I talk too much, don't I?
You must think
I'm always telling these Tangy Tales.
"Tangy Tales"?
Haven't you read that magazine?
It has such fun, pulpy stories.
Really.
So is that how you got the job?
By telling them Tangy Tales
during your interview?
Believe it or not,
it was something like that.
The manager asked me what my hobbies were.
I told him I do palm-reading.
That's it.
You learn that much in a Brahmin house.
I looked at his palm
and just rattled off a few things.
Astrology, fortune-telling, blah-blah…
And I got a call the next day.
They didn't ask you
if you can work on Excel and Tally?
No. Sir said that Mr. Alok
will teach me everything.
Everyone's so helpful.
Anyway, I've managed to learn
quite a bit in the last few days.
Did I say something wrong?
Nothing. It's just…
I miss my mom suddenly.
I can understand.
Look.
Neither is Dashrath your best friend…
nor is Kavita my friend anymore.
From today onwards, we'll be friends.
Okay?
I made pulao today. Ma taught me.
I think I overdid the cardamom. Try some?
-No.
-Come on. Just one bite.
Just want to say
Stay with me, always
Your hands, these nights
Our little secrets
Snuck in a corner
Tucked under my pillow
Like a magic potion
Stay with me
Wherever I go
I pass through you
To find myself
Just want to say
Stay with me, always
Forever, stay
Priya.
-Sorry, I'm really late.
-Not at all.
And I forgot to get the box of sweets.
Never mind. Come in.
-It smells delicious.
-Right?
Totally.
You know,
I haven't had chicken since I got married.
If my in-laws find out,
they'll be in shock.
-A Sharma girl eating meat--
-Stop talking.
Tell me how it tastes.
Salt?
-It's perfect.
-Is it salty enough?
You have magic in your hands.
-Give me your hands.
-Why?
I thought you were going to read my palm.
Sorry.
I gave you sloppy kisses.
What? Do you want sloppy kisses, too?
-Come.
-He just wants chicken.
I see.
So you won't share
my sloppy kisses with anyone?
Sorry.
No, it's okay.
I understand.
Come.
Why did you call me here?
Actually, the manager
told me to not go downstairs.
He said there are strange people there,
and the place stinks.
Please sit.
Yeah.
What else?
What else did the manager say?
Nothing else.
But I don't care about any of this.
You can come here.
We'll have our own small world.
Our little corner.
Where no men are allowed.
There are men around here.
By the way, didn't you see
my WhatsApp message?
Yeah, I did.
I won't take any excuses.
You have to come for my birthday.
Shiv especially asked me to invite you.
Please come?
My in-laws are after my life.
They say there are
no ladies at the factory.
If they meet you,
they'll stop pestering me to quit.
Please?
All right.
-Bharti. Come in.
-Sorry.
-No, I'll wait outside.
-Come.
Is she always dressed like this?
Yes.
-To what caste do Banerjees belong?
-They're Bengali Brahmins, Ma.
Be cautious about who you mingle with.
Your father-in-law
will be a head-priest next year.
-Yes.
-Okay?
From there, yes.
From this side…
Hello. How are you?
Please come.
Here comes the birthday girl. Please come.
I'll be back in two minutes.
-Excuse me.
-God bless you.
Well, a cake contains eggs.
So my father wouldn't allow it.
He's stuck in a time-warp, you see.
You're right.
So here's what I did. I worked
all night churning milk and grinding nuts
and made, for my beautiful wife,
a pristine milk cake.
-Here, do the honors.
-Keep it there.
So I shouldn't serve her?
Yes, come.
It's a birthday to remember.
You deserve this first.
No, silly girl.
Are you in a time-warp, too?
Like my father.
You're getting influenced. Here, eat.
Why are you crying?
Serve it to everyone.
We got you a birthday cake, after all.
Help your sister-in-law.
Please have some hot samosas.
Please have some.
What's the matter?
When I take a bath,
Shiv irons my clothes for me.
My WhatsApp reads
"Shiv is typing" all day.
Then his messages pop up.
"What are you up to?" With a smiley.
Look.
He sends me
cute baby pictures every morning.
Shiv wants a child,
and I can't even get myself to love him.
What should I do?
Is there some defect in me?
Should I see a doctor?
-Am I crazy?
-No.
It's crazy that I can't love
such a nice man, right?
Please.
Please help me.
At times like this, I really miss Kavita.
You loved Kavita a lot, right?
And me?
Even more than Kavita.
Look, there's no defect
in us that needs to be fixed.
Listen.
You need to own your truth.
That's the only way you can be happy.
I've accepted my truth.
Now that you know a part of my truth…
another truth is that…
I'm not Bharti Banerjee.
My name is Bharti Mandal.
I'm a Dalit.
My mother and granny are midwives,
like most women of our caste.
Someone's calling.
Hello, sir.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Yes, sir.
The manager said I've made a big blunder.
Will you please come with me?
Yeah, let's go.
I'm telling you the truth.
I think we are all prepared.
She's here.
You wait outside.
Okay, she's here now.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Priya
Happy birthday to you
Have some snacks, sir.
Before they go cold.
Cut and distribute the cake to everyone.
No one's eating the samosas.
They're just sitting there.
Thanks to you, we've cut
a cake here for the first time.
Really?
So what if you cut a cake on Sunday?
Your office can still celebrate on Monday.
Please have it.
I have an announcement to make.
I've given orders to install
a ladies' toilet in our office.
-It was long overdue.
-Superb.
All you workers
can share the rest of the cake.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Sorry.
The manager and others were around.
Or I would have fed you cake, too.
You were saying something earlier, right?
About owning my truth,
accepting my identity
to find happiness?
Priya, I'm going to tell you something.
Listen carefully.
It may sound strange at first.
You told me the other day
how Kavita is so happy with her life.
Think about it.
You guys had loads of fun in college.
But now she's settled in
with her new family.
She has a respectable life.
In all these years,
she's never called you.
Why?
Because she is really happy.
She's found her identity as a mother.
Similarly, the thing
that will make you feel complete…
is being a mother.
Once you become a mother,
you'll stop fighting within yourself.
This storm inside you will settle down.
Only a child can bring you closer to Shiv.
But I'm not even 30 yet.
Priya, I was 32 when I had a miscarriage.
After three months, my husband left me.
Our palm lines often deceive us.
Anyway, you're fully ready to be a mother.
You have to decide.
Whether you want to suffer like me…
or live happily.
With respect.
With Shiv.
Think about it.
My heart's not convinced, Miss Bharti.
But thank you.
Without your help…
I don't know what I would've done.
Really.
Thanks a lot.
I barely finished talking.
I just mentioned a baby
and Shiv got so excited.
He was so happy
that he started making sweets at midnight.
He woke everyone up.
That's when I understood what you meant.
You were right.
I'll have a baby.
You've made the right choice.
But will you help me?
Sure.
Tell me. Do you get your period on time?
Yes.
Doing it ten days before
and after the menstrual cycle
increases your chances
of getting pregnant.
The uterus opens up at this time.
Wow. You know so much.
How did you learn?
The same way you learnt palm-reading.
Right.
You'll have to keep track
of when you do it in a diary.
All right.
Now I know when I'm supposed to do it…
But where?
There's no place at home.
We're a family of 11
in a two-room apartment.
No. You asked me
to feed him biscuits, right? I fed him.
Shiv must be on his way.
Did the manager ask about me?
Yes, I told him…
"Ladies' problems."
Thank you. Also,
I had to tally April's expense sheet…
Yeah, I've done it.
It's in the expense folder.
Wow!
You did it in 20 minutes flat.
It takes me at least two hours.
Thank you so much.
Sloppy kisses.
Shiv's here.
I'll hang up now.
Yeah, okay.
All the best.
Thank you.
I have to leave in 15 minutes.
-What?
-Yes.
Okay, move.
Sorry.
-Did you get hurt?
-No.
Forget about that.
Thank you.
That's it.
Are you okay?
Should this be happening now?
Morning sickness doesn't occur during
the last month. Must be indigestion.
Let's go?
Are the reports okay?
Yes, sir. Just got
a check-up done. Everything's normal.
Great.
Sir, you've been so helpful.
I'll be back in three months.
Please don't hire someone else.
I understand.
You must take complete rest.
But we can't stall work for three months.
No, sir, that's what
I wanted to discuss with you.
Bharti knows all the work.
She can manage until I'm back.
She's been helping me all these days.
All right.
I can't say no to you.
Thank you, sir.
-Shall I leave?
-Sure.
4 MONTHS LATER
Bharti. When did you come?
Just now.
-Shut the door, please.
-Yes.
Little prince.
Looks just like you.
Sit.
You look all settled.
-How's everyone in the office?
-Everyone's fine.
What happened?
Nothing.
I wonder if I made a mistake.
All day I'm either changing diapers,
cooking or breastfeeding.
And Shiv seems weirdly distant lately.
He's very helpful.
But even his niceness
has started to prick me.
Kavita was right.
"You're married, but you still want
to frolic on a scooter with pompoms."
You're a mother now.
Focus on your baby.
Miss Bharti, thank you so much.
-Come on.
-No, really. I mean it.
She just praises you all the time.
She told us how you
encouraged and supported her.
Honestly, you've brought
all this joy to our family.
It's nothing.
We don't want to give you more trouble.
She'll resume work this month.
-Right?
-Again?
The baby hasn't even
learned how to drink milk yet,
and you want her to start work?
-Ma--
-Bharti, you tell them.
Priya was telling me your mother
and grandma are midwives, right?
You must’ve learnt such work
considering the caste you belong to.
Put some sense into them.
Okay.
Make a separate file for cash flow.
Already did it, sir.
I emailed you yesterday.
I sent the purchase records, too.
Really?
Good.
Okay, sir.
By the way…
-I spoke to Priya.
-Really?
She needs some more time.
Your mother's right.
It'll take you some months
to regain your health.
A mother needs proper nutrition.
And looking after the baby,
feeding him, changing diapers…
Being a mom is a full-time responsibility.
Feeding the baby, changing diapers, etc.
And then to handle
office work and all that stress.
And factory conditions are so unhygienic.
It stinks so much there.
It won't be good for her health.
She seemed a bit stressed.
That would definitely
affect the baby's health.
Right?
She's quit the job.
So you can take over her responsibilities.
Yes, sir.
As you deem fit.
UNSPOKEN
Hot.
May I say something?
Say it.
So should I leave?
Where do you want to go?
Madam?
Bandra.
Don't walk away.
I'm not done talking to you!
One second! One second, just wait.
Don't "one second" me, Natasha.
-This is your entire plot.
-What plot?
Your game, your strategy, your tricks.
Every time
you accuse me of all these things.
Hey, I'm not accusing you.
I'm just trying
to show you the truth, Rohan.
What truth?
That I'm a bad father?
-Okay, I'm a bad father. Happy?
-Did I say that?
Don't put words in my mouth, okay?
I'm just saying
that you're a distant father.
I've heard that. And I've also heard that…
I'm unavailable. I'm disinterested.
That I don't talk to my daughter.
What does it all come up to?
That Rohan Sharma is a bad father.
Rohan, you are a very good father.
-Make an effort to talk to the child.
-You know what? I don't give a shit.
Don't use that term. It infuriates me!
I don't give a shit
about that either, so shut up.
Have you ever thought
about what all I do for Samaira?
I'm bloody moving heaven and Earth
to get a cochlear implant done.
Maybe you don't know,
but I've talked to her about this.
And she wants it, too.
You don't talk to her!
You send her WhatsApp messages!
That's because
I'm bloody working day and night!
I don't have time
to learn the sign language!
Sign language is her only language, Rohan.
She's going deaf.
How many of us are you going to lose
before you
come to grips with this situation?
Just because you can't handle this,
doesn't mean you bring it out on her.
You have to talk to her, at least.
If you can't understand it,
it's your problem.
Don't bring it out on my child!
Enough!
I don't have as much spare time as you do
to learn painting,
poetry and sign language.
Please understand, and leave me alone.
I will be on time
for dinner tonight. I promise. Bye.
She looks just like you.
She's way prettier than me.
Wait. You speak sign language?
When most people come here,
they keep trying to talk to me.
Some communicate through writing.
And I end up
getting tired of all that reading.
You must know what I mean, right?
Take this girl, for example.
When I was taking this photo…
this girl just kept pouting and posing.
It just ended up looking silly.
I was fed up.
I think these days
people have forgotten how to be happy.
So then, what did you do?
I told this girl…
a Deaf joke.
And then she finally started laughing.
What was the joke?
Wait a minute…
You told this girl a joke. Told her, how?
With my mind.
Who is she?
That's you 15 years later.
Or maybe you 15 years ago.
Hey. I'm not that old.
Where's Dad?
Work.
Busy?
Busy.
Mom?
Do you think I'll ever be
able to lead a normal life?
Of course, yes.
You're unable to hear.
-But you are absolutely perfect.
-No.
I don't mean that.
I mean, do you think I'll be loved?
Like this?
You'll be loved a lot by someone someday.
Even more than I love you.
I don't think so.
Why are you saying this, honey?
Mom, look at you.
So pretty.
You can obviously hear.
Dad still doesn't love you.
And if someone can't love you,
then do I even stand a chance?
This old couple was just sitting
so happily and enjoying the rain.
Or maybe they were tired.
Fed up.
And just sat in the rain in despair.
I think…
the photographs you click…
have a little sadness in them.
What people see in my photographs,
it says less about me…
and more about them.
Could you ever hear?
Yes, with a cochlear implant.
If you're able to hear with an implant,
then why do you choose
to remain deaf and unhappy?
Because people always lied to me.
So I got it removed.
Your lips…
can always lie.
But your eyes always the truth.
Do you know why books are better…
over movies?
Because when we read books,
we create our own world.
I could always hear sounds
with a hearing aid,
but now I can create
my own soundtrack without them.
I can hear you in my mind.
And your voice sounds just so beautiful.
You know I can hear, right?
And I know what you sound like, too.
Nats, have a look at this.
There's a long waiting period
for cochlear implant.
But I have a friend who can
bring it down to six months. Good, right?
Now what?
You're planning for tomorrow,
but what about today?
What about right now?
Natasha, just stop it, okay?
It's such a simple thing.
Just look into her eyes and talk to her.
You make it sound like
I don't love my own daughter.
But your daughter
is gonna feel that you don't love her.
I know you love her.
Just go tell her that…
in her language.
Just make her laugh.
I'm really tired
of listening to your voice.
If you'll try to hear it
with your mind, you'll know.
What do you call a deaf dog?
Doesn't matter because it can't hear you.
How many
serious relationships have you had?
One. It's finished now.
What do you mean, "It's finished"?
I don't care, okay? Bye.
What happened?
Nothing important.
What "nothing important"?
You have to tell me, come on.
Please.
Till the time I tell you,
you won't let me relax?
Just relax, Natasha.
Don't tell me to relax.
That's the last thing you say
to somebody when they're angry.
That's because
you react to every little thing.
It's always the little things
that matter, not the big promises.
What's important
is that people understand each other.
When was the last time
that you said "I love you" to someone?
Too scared.
Hi, Samaira.
I…
I love…
I love you.
Hot.
May I say something?
Say it.
So should I leave?
It's here.
-You are supposed to respect me.
-Respect.
I think… I am… trying.
Mom.
Hey, Nats.
I asked her what she'd like for breakfast,
and you know what she said?
"I don't give a…"
Say. "I don't give a shit."
-What are you laughing at?
-At you.
To breakfast now, you naughty girl.
Come on. Chop-chop. Hurry up.
Nats?
Who is it?
Nobody.
It's just some salesman.
We don't need anything.
We don't need anything.
You…
managed to lie…
with your eyes.
I'm sorry.
That man loved you?
