Oh no!
You're out of tune.
Completely out of tune.
- What's up, Maestro? - A lifeless
voice can't sing in tune.
Sounds like she has a sore throat.
- What's wrong, Kiran?
- She needn't say. I know it all.
All these girls do nowadays
is to roam till late...
... at nights with friends.
She has shouted her voice hoarse.
And they'll eat whatever they like.
ls that a sign of love for music?
- That's going to get you nowhere.
- Please do not say so, maestro.
Tell us Kiran, d'you or don't you
want to master classical music?
You must devote yourself
completely to your lessons.
I'll be back after a few days.
Get over the sore throat by then.
Greetings, Sir.
- Does he have a problem with me?
- Never mind the daily dramatics.
Have you got the tickets
to the New Year's party?
A pack of biscuits and a bread.
Need anything more?
- No thanks. How much was that?
- Fifteen bucks.
Rohit Kumar, your neighbor upstairs,
screams his head off all day.
- Aren't your ears sore already?
- That's him rehearsing music.
And he loves music. Besides,
l am not irked to complain.
For God's sake!
How come you're so busy with your
accounts so early in the morning?
- Won't you sit down to a cuppa?
- Woe beside!
Rohit Kumar hasn't paid
me in 3 months now.
He gets me to make him new
dresses every now and then.
But just doesn't bother
to pay for the stitching.
He owes me a large sum too.
But I just can't complain.
Hey Kanhaiya! Come over
for a cup of tea.
Give it a rev.
It's all your fault.
You've given the house to a
tuppence worth of a singer on rent.
All you have for yourself
is a room in the backyard.
- Has he paid the rents yet? - He'll
pay up in due course. Fine fellow.
How are you, Rohit?
- Come over here, Qasim.
- ln a moment.
- I'm ravenous.
- What can I get you?
-2 fried eggs, buttered toasts, jam,
a special cup of tea. - Coming up.
Hello, Mr. Jamshed.
How d'you do?
- Forget niceties. Talk cash. - Some
bills are due for a couple of months.
Today's the first of the month.
I'll settle everything by the 30th.
Very well... er... what
did you say? By the 30th?
- Exactly. How many days between
the 30th and the first? - One day.
- There you are. - The number of
days between the 1st and the 30th...
- He's making a fool out of Jamshed.
- That's right.
Didn't you have a show last night?
How did it go?
- It was a riot! - Was it then?!
- The crowd went berserk as I sang.
And the girls were crazy about me.
There was this girl
who caught my eye.
She has beautiful eyes
and a pretty face.
- Fabulous! What happened later?
- She left after the program ended.
If she comes into my life, I'll
write the best songs on earth.
Dream you may.
But everyone cannot become Elvis.
Shut up Moolchand. You're a grocer.
What d'you know about music?
Someday Rohit Kumar will make the
greatest singer in our country.
No one even bothers to listen.
Look... it's Mehra. He's counting
the proceeds of the show last night.
- He made 50 to 60,000 last night.
- And we don't get a penny of it.
Happy New Year, Mr. Mehra.
What's so special about a New Year?
Just another day and another night.
Oh yes. But it was a grand
show last night, wasn't it?
- Well, average, I'd say.
- Average, d'you say? - About that.
- There! Look at the pile you made
last night. - What are you up to?!
It's all because of me, Sir.
People come here to hear me sing.
- That's how you sake in the moolah.
- D'you take yourself for a star...
... just because I've put up
a couple of your portraits?
- You see, Sir. I am...
- You should be grateful to me!
Grateful for letting you sing
before such a large gathering!
Minstrels like you roam the
streets a dime-a-dozen.
And no one would even
care to give you tuppence.
You ingrate!
How dare you misbehave! You come
here to sing. Not to chase girls!
I'm not chasing her, Sir.
l was just...
- I'm responsible for the harangue.
- It's a part of my daily diet.
Now, what's it you were saying?
- I'd like to learn how to
sing from you. - From me?!
And, you wrote such a beautiful
song. I'm crazy about your song.
I can't think of anything else.
I couldn't sleep last night after
your show. I kept humming the tune.
- Neither did I sleep after
the show last night. - Why?
It is a new tune that
kept me up all the night.
Would you like to hear it?
Such a beautiful song!
Songs like that are what I'd like
to sing. Not the classicals.
Please teach me how to
sing a song like that.
I'll work hard at it.
Why don't we get married, Kiran?
What?!
I've never thought about it.
- I've only think about one thing.
- What?
Music and my career. I want to make
the greatest singer of the land.
- That'll be difficult.
- Why?
Because that status has been booked
for me a long while ago.
What could be better for both of us?
We travel towards same goals. And
we could reach our goal together.
Tell me.... will you marry me?
What brings you here?
- He's a famous singer. - I see.
So you are a singer, are you?
Actually, I'm a composer.
I write the songs I sing.
Classicals?
- Not classicals. I sing
lighter tunes. - How light?
- I don't think you understand.
- Please help me too.
I sing songs that strike a chord
in the heart.
And where do you sing such songs?
- Presently, I sing at a hotel.
- At a hotel?
One might as well sing at a hotel
as go around with a begging bowl.
As with wandering minstrels who
collect pence in tips if at all.
Enough. I have not come here
to discuss my careers.
So, what brings you here?
Excuse me, Kiran.
Stop, Rohit!
Listen to me.....
I didn't invite Rohit so you
might insult him.
D'you take me for a fool? A look at
him and I know why you invited him.
Stop being foolish. Your marriage
has already been fixed.
- I'm in love with Rohit.
- Do you hear what she says?
You must consider the consequences.
This is not done.
The upbringing and education I've
given her all these years are a waste!
If you think so highly about my
upbringing and my education,...
... you should respect
my decisions too.
I have a feeling that he's a
cunning fellow. He's ensnaring you.
- You're still an innocent girl.
- I'm no innocent, mother.
And what does that make of you?
I'm an artist. And, he's an artist
too. You can't gauge our sentiments.
Don't I understand? An artist
my foot! A Bremen-town musician!
A good for nothing vagabond! And she
wants to marry him!
You'll get to know about
the realities in life in no time!
Don't you come back crying later on.
Our doors will have closed for you.
Just as well that you told me all
this. It'll help me take my decision.
I'm going to marry Rohit.
- I'll floor them at the audition
today. - May I accompany you?
It'll take me 2 minutes
to get dressed.
lsn't the plumber expected in today?
See you. Bye.
How are you going to climb four
stories in the condition you are?
But, this is your first recording.
And I wanted to be there with you.
I'm not recording for a film. Its
just a jingle for an advertisement.
When am I going to meet the right
people? When will I start working?
It's just a matter of a few more
months. What makes you so upright?
- Hello, Farida. Come in.
- What are you doing?
Nothing much. Just cooking.
- Like a cup of tea? - Why not?
- ls the tea brewed? - Yes.
I haven't seen you
around in 4 or 5 days.
- Have you been keeping well?
- Absolutely.
- What's the matter? You seem tense.
- Not at all. I'm perfectly fine.
How are your music
rehearsals going on?
l hardly find time outside household
chores. How am I to rehearse?
What of the career in music? Can you
immerse yourself so in the chores?
You must carve out some time
everyday for rehearsing.
Look at me... I must fetch Sonu
from school after I finish cooking.
I'll go and fetch Sonu... Yes. l
will. It doesn't really matter.
Will you please draw a bath for me?
Make it fast. I've to attend a party.
- What party? - Oh, there's
something I'd like you to know.
- I've dumped the job.
- Why?
l had enough of Mehra's abuses.
Besides, I want to move upwards.
- What's more, I met Gulbadan
Kumar today. - Gulbadan Kumar?!
Yes. He owns Prince Records. Its
really tough to get to meet him.
I walked into his office and sang
a few songs. He liked my voice.
He invited me to the party this
evening. Looks like I've made it.
- Just press these clothes for me,
will you? - I'm coming with you!
- What'll you do there? You'd get
bored. - No. I won't get bored.
- What about Sonu?
- Farida can put him to sleep.
All right. You can come along.
Get dressed in some good clothes.
Now. Take the clothes.
Press them quickly.
Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan Kumar.
Ever since your company was formed...
-... music sales have grown manifold.
-It's the grace of The Divine Mother.
A double gold disc for the music
directors. Someday I'll get mine too.
l've recorded my voice on
a cassette... Rohit...!
l've recorded one of
my songs in a cassette.
- Will you please give it
to Gulbadan Kumar? - All right.
Hows the good lady? I greet you
in the name of The Divine Mother.
- Hello. - I'm Rohit Kumar.
- Of course, Mr. Rohit Kumar.
- Greetings! - Grand party.
- It's modest really.
- Have you listened to my cassette?
- Yes I did. - Did you like it?
- Very nice.
- Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir.
Glory be to The Divine Mother!
Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan!
You're raking in gold discs.
Let's pose for a photograph.
- You're the biggest of them all.
- Not at all. - lsn't it, now?
It's the two of you, Messrs Amar &
Kaushik who are the most well known.
That's the magic of our music.
We've defined 6 super hit films.
- Our critics are now silenced.
- lndeed. lndeed, Mr. Gulbadan.
You must listen to the music
we've scored for our next film.
- The Divine Mother be praised. - We
recorded a song yesterday. Beautiful!
Which film is the song meant for?
Well... he's an upcoming artiste.
He's also a singer.
- Mr. Rahul Kumar.
- I'm Rohit Kumar, Sir.
Oh yes,... Mr. Rohit Kumar.
- Do you sing?
- Yes, Sir.
I see. For whom
have you sung till now?
- Nothing special yet. - Yes. Go on.
- I want to sing for you.- Of course.
- Don't forget to give my cassette.
- Oh yes. But, stop it now, will you?
- Yes... what is it?
- I'm not only a singer.
l've written a few songs too.
- And what are you?!
- A composer.
ln a country like ours, just
about anyone can turn a composer.
Call me up on Monday. If your
voice is worth it, you're made.
I'll come over on Monday
after giving you a call.
What more could you want?
Glory be to The Divine Mother.
- Mr. Gulbadan...
- Yes, Sir.
Why aren't you giving
him my cassette?
- I can't give the cassette now.
- Why?
- It was so difficult getting an
audition for myself. - So what?
How can I ask them to
audition my wife too?
They'll think I'm trying to
force my family down their throats.
- So, d'you feel that I'm imposing
myself upon you? - I never said that.
- That's what you meant! - I'm tired
and I don't want to get into a fight.
D'you mean to say that l
want to get into a fight?
Sonu is sleeping.
l'd only asked you to hand over
my cassette. Was it so difficult?
I haven't heard what you've recorded.
I don't even know what's in it.
I don't know if it's worth a hearing.
And, it was tough getting an audition.
Must I lose a chance by trying
to push your cassette?
An hour ago, you loved my voice.
Now, it isn't worth auditioning!
I don't mean that. One must practice
regularly to be able to sing properly.
Just another excuse! And I think l
understand you perfectly, Rohit.
You've been pursuing your career.
And all I get are flimsy excuses.
- Please don't scream.
- Why don't you say it plainly?
That I don't have the aesthetics.
That I should stop dreaming about...
...becoming a professional singer.
That's not what's going to be, Rohit.
I won't give up! And you for one,
cannot break my resolve! Get that?
I don't know why Rohit is doing
this. He mustn't do this to you.
- It's wrong on his part. - We've
finished our homework, Mother.
- May we go to play? - Make sure
you return soon. - All right.
You have the right to a career.
Why don't you discuss it with Rohit?
What are you doing here? I've been
looking for you so long.
- I had to discuss some
things with Farida. - What?
Besides Sonu is getting on my nerves.
Who is to take care of him?
I have to go to a rehearsal. Where
are my clothes? How about some food?
- I'm coming over. - And, where's
the file of my songs?
l've been looking for it all day.
I just can't find it.
l'd brought it down with me for my
practice session.
Why don't you just sit over here for
the rest of the day practicing!
- I said I'm coming. - Don't bother.
You can practice singing...
...for the rest of the day. I'll
feed myself at a restaurant.
- I'll look after the household too.
- Have I ever refused to do all that?
- What've you done? - Sorry, Mother.
- You've got my washing all dirty.
l've been at the laundry for 2 hours.
And I've asked you not to play here.
How many times have l
asked you not to play?!
What's up, Kiran? Why did you beat
him? What has he done?
He won't listen to me. And now,
he's got the laundry all dirty.
I'm sick and tired of chorus all day.
l've gone out of my mind.
We tread upon the same path, Kiran.
What could be better for both of us?
Open up, quickly.
Come on, hurry up.
Make sure to remember the day today.
We'll celebrate this day every year.
This is the day I've awaited forever.
The day on which my career commences!
Today was the day! Amar-Kaushik were
left speechless after I auditioned.
I'm singing the first song
for Pawan Chopra's new film.
I'm leaving, Rohit.
And they said that if this song
passes the muster while recording...
...I'll get to sing all the songs
for the film. I'm recording tomorrow.
- Want to come along?
- I said I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?
- Here are the keys to the house.
These are the rationing cards...and
here are the bills for the month.
l've paid all the bills.
You'll find the balance of the
money in the cupboard.
Here's the electricity bill. Make
sure you pay it up by the weekend.
I'm leaving you.
Wait a minute! What are you saying?
What's happened?
- Have I done anything wrong?
- No, you haven't. - What's it then?
- Tell me.
- Don't touch me!
- Just let me go. - But why are
you leaving? Say something!
Why don't you understand! It isn't
just an isolated something.
It might be my mistake too.
- Something is happening to me.
- What's this with you?
- I don't know! - It's nothing more
than a figment of your imagination.
-I must make a life for myself. -But
this and here, is what your life is!
Else, I'll go out of my mind.
So you want to walk out of this
marriage. But what of Sonu?
How can you walk out on him?
But, he's better off without me.
Oh God! I don't believe this! Kiran!
Why are you doing this to me?!
l've just got my golden chance. And
here you are...walking out on me!
I need you, Kiran. If you stand by
me, I can even reach for the stars.
But you had told me that we'd reach
out for the stars together.
D'you feel that I'm trying to stop
you from becoming a singer?
You might dream of becoming a singer.
But don't expect me to go around
singing false praises for you.
I lost my head. I agree that both
of us have made mistakes.
But that doesn't mean that you must
walk out of your home. lsn't that so?
We can always mend our ways.
Now , come in.
Now you're being stubborn. Just
like your parents.
-Don't drag my parents into this.
-Why not? You carry the same traits.
Now, are you going to stop
taunting my parents?!
Won't l! They haven't been able to
achieve anything in life.
And they're jealous of others.
- And d'you think I'm jealous of
your success? - Yes!
Thank you very much.
I won't ever forget that.
l'd rather suffer my traits than
your taunts for the rest of my life.
Where has Kiran gone?
- What I should be asking you?
- Why me?
Because she used to spend more than
half her working hours in your company.
And the two of you must've more than
discussed my weak points.
Forget all that. Kiran has left you.
- We must do something about it.
- Not ''we''. It's I who has to do.
And I'll do whatever must be done.
You must try to understand it now
or never. Kiran is very unhappy.
- And the fact is that... - Fact
remains that of the past 6 years...
... I've been trying heart and soul
to get a break...
... so that my career can take off;
so that my life shapes up!
After 6 long years, I get a break.
I'm slated to sing for Amar-Kaushik!
I took a cab home as soon as I got
to know; so that I could...
... share the greatest moment of
my life with her.
And she tells me that she's
walking out of my life.
- What does it mean?! - She couldn't
share the greatest moment of your life.
- It's your life, after all.
- You're fantastic!
That your husband deserted you
because you were unhappy...
... doesn't mean that every woman
is unhappy with her husband.
I haven't come here to discuss my
husband. I'm concerned about Kiran.
- You may keep your concern within
your confines. - I shall.
Before I leave, let me tell you that
you could never understand Kiran.
She is no petty woman to serve as
a part of your interior decor.
She had her own dreams. And it
takes courage for a woman to walk out.
Yes! And it takes more to walk out
on a helpless child. lsn't that so?
- Why are you sleeping here?
- Oh.. what? - And where's Mummy?
- Tell me... Where's Mummy?
- What's the time now?
The small hand is on 7.
And the big hand is on 3.
I'm going to be late
for the recording.
- Tell me, Daddy... where's Mummy?
- Wait a minute.
- You mother has gone to your aunt's.
- Which aunt?
-The one in Pune. -Aunt Ratna lives
there. - That's where she has gone.
- When is she going to come back?
- Very soon.. in 3 or 4 days.
Now make a move.
l've got to get ready.
- Who's going to get me ready
for school? - I will, son.
- And, who'll pack my school bag?
- I will.
- Who'll take me to school?
- I will.
- What about my breakfast? - l...
what do you eat for breakfast?
An omelette of 2 eggs, toast with
butter and Bournvita.
A dash of coriander... and onions.
Ever had one of my omelets?
- No.
- Try it today. You'll love it.
- You're cutting them in such
large chunks! - That's just fine.
lsn't this fun! Yes, it's fun.
Now, take a look at this.. a circus
with one hand... two eggs in one hand!
Now take a look at how I break
both eggs using one hand.
The eggs had soft-shells.
But never mind.
This place is perfectly clean.
What are you doing?
I'm not going to eat that!
- It has shells in it. - A few
shells will make the omelette crisp.
- Here go the onions... and the
chilies. - Not that way! - How else?
Mummy used to flip the
ingredients first.
What Mummy doesn't know is that an
omelette is an omelette, flip or flap!
Eat it and you'll know. Later on,
I'll drop you at the school.
And afterwards, I'm off to record
my first song ever!
Your Daddy is going to
become a famous singer.
- What's up?
- The toast is burning!
Well, never mind that.
You don't know a thing!
Go on in... hurry.
Go inside.
- Who'll come to pick me up?
- I'll come.
Where are you going to
wait for me?
I'll wait for you under this tree,
okay? Now go on inside.
- What if you don't turn up?
- I said I'll come. And, I will.
- What if you're late? - I won't
be late. I'll be here on time.
- What if you're still late? - If
I am, you can wait under the tree.
Go on, now. Hurry.
- When does the school get over?
- No idea.
When does the junior school
get over?
- I'm that child's father.
- At 2 o'clock.
- I'm sorry to be late.
- ls this your idea of time?
You've turned a star even before
you've recorded a single song.
-I got stuck in the traffic. - Never
mind. Sit inside and get the lines.
We'll record the orchestra in the
meantime. Let's have another take.
- Give him his lines, will you?
- Come on for the break in your life.
- We can fit the 16 tracks on to 12.
- Very well. Let's try.
Let's have the rhythm.
Still waiting here? I'm afraid
we won't be recording you today.
- Sir...?
- lncrease the bass slightly.
- When will I record?
- After a couple of days perhaps.
Do keep calling to find out.
I'm late by only half-an-hour.
Must you be so upset?
- You said you'd be here on time.
- I did. But I was so busy.
- What if someone kidnapped me?
- But no one did?
What if someone did?
l've told ten times that
I'm sorry.
You must forgive
someone who apologizes.
Do you know the meaning
of the word ''sorry''?
What are you doing?
What's up?
This car run on batteries. It has a
horn. And, the headlights work too.
- So what?
- I'll forgive you if you buy me one.
What if I don't? Won't
you forgive me ever?
Had it been Mummy, she would've got
the car for me.
Ask your mother for one when she
comes back. Now, let's go. Come on.
- 250 grams of lentil... anything
else? - A packet of tea.
- The Red Label, or the Yellow?
- Yellow. - Not Yellow. The Red one.
- Why? - Because Mummy used to buy
the Red Label. - Give me red.
A pack of soap and coconut oil.
- Can I have a chocolate?
- Take these upstairs.
Forgive me for asking this... but l
heard something. ls it true?
I heard that your wife left your...
no, I mean to say that she didn't...
... care for you. She didn't care
for the child. Nor her status!
Let me have this package.
And I didn't like her either.
She used to have this temper.
Have I asked you what you liked
or disliked about my wife?
- No, I mean...
- Have I asked for your opinion?
I come here to buy groceries. Not
to listen to your useless banter.
- Do you understand?
- Understood. Here's your stuff.
That's worth 300. The balance last
month was 350, totaling 650 bucks.
- And I've stopped giving credit.
- I'm not asking for it.
Here's your money. 550.. and I'm
sending 100 bucks for you right away.
That's the credit.
- ls that all right, Mr. Manohar?
- Yes. Let's record it.
Thank you, Mr. Sharma for letting
my friend sing in the chorus.
- She'll even sing a lead part if
you let her do it. - Of course.
Shall we proceed, Mr. Manohar?
Take a look at this!
A letter from Mummy.
A letter from Mummy! Here!
- I see... it's addressed to you.
- Oh yes! It is.
Read it, quickly. And tell me when
Mummy is coming home.
- Read it aloud.
- Oh, yes.
''My dear Sunil...''
''You must be wondering where your
Mummy has gone all of a sudden.''
''Let me explain this... sometimes
your Daddy had to leave home.''
''And then, it was Mummy
who looked after you.''
''Sometimes, when mothers leave,
fathers have to look after children.''
''Your Mummy wants to make a
career for herself, Sunil.''
''That's why I had to
leave your home.''
''I may not live with you anymore.
But, you'll remain in my heart.''
''Don't ever think that
Mummy will forget you.''
''I remain your Mummy always.
And I'll love you always.''
''Take care of yourself. And, on
your way back from school everyday...''
That was marvelous. Ms. Vandana.
And you must concentrate, Rohit.
I want the right perspective
in your voice.
Don't sing in a stifled voice.
Open your voice up.
That's my file, Sir. It contains
the songs I have written.
Don't be afraid.
We won't steal your tunes.
No! I didn't mean that.
Let's proceed with another take.
Let's have a rehearsal without
the music accompaniment.
That's a lot of crap! Let's have
some real voice. Haven't you eaten?
- Go on... sing it.
- Yes, Sir.
Forget about turning a music
director and concentrate on singing.
- I'll ruin his happiness.
- Why! We have a composer!
- Go on.
- Yes, Sir.
Nonsense! Forget it. Please sing
his lines for him, Ms. Vandana.
- Well done, Ms. Vandana. Excellent.
- Did you get an idea of the tune?
- That's what I've been singing.
- Sing it properly! - Yes, Sir.
What are you doing! You're out
of tune! What are you up to?!
- Please let me finish my lines.
- Shut up!
- If you interrupt, you can't
appreciate the singing. - Shut up!
0-Please listen to me. -Bloody fool!
Shut up! Who d'you think you are?
Stay within your limits!
Else I'll throw you out of here.
And, I'll banish you forever
from filmdom.
Will a singer in a night club to
teach me how to compose music?!
- Yes. I can.
- What! What was it you said?!
Oh yes! I'll teach you how to score
music right away.
That is, if you may dare
to listen to me.
lsn't this how you've composed it?
lsn't that your song?
Now listen to this.
Please play along with me.
What are you up to, Sunil?
Be quiet and eat your food.
Pick up your spoon.
Go on. Eat.
- It's yucky. - It's bell plant and
it's very good for you. Go on, eat it.
-I don't like bell plants. -You do.
Aunt Farida has cooked it for you.
And you've eaten it earlier.
- What's all this black stuff
in this? - Onions. Now eat it.
-Onions give me stomachaches. -Not
at all. And now start with the bread.
- It's Yucky.
- You mustn't call food ''yucky''.
Don't spit on your plate.
Where are your manners?
Go on. Eat it now.
There... I've removed the onions.
There's this chocolate ice-cream
you've brought. It's in the fridge.
Yes I know about the ice cream.
But, you won't get any of it.
You must finish your food first.
Only afterwards you may eat it.
Sunil!... Where are you going?
Don't you open the fridge!
Now don't take the ice-cream out
of the fridge.
Can't you hear me? I'm getting
very angry with this now.
Don't take the ice cream.
I'm warning you, Sunil.
I'm warning you.
Don't you dare eat that ice cream.
Eat the ice-cream and you'll face
dire consequences. D'you understand?
Get up. Now!
And let go of the chair.
You unmannered boy!
And stop screaming.
- I want to got to Mummy!
- Enough of it.
No food for you. Nor any ice cream.
You can go to sleep hungry.
I won't talk to you ever again.
He's asleep.
Will you leave me and go away too?
- Never.
- But Mummy left me and went away.
- That's because I'm a bad boy.
- ls that what you think?
That isn't true. Mummy loves you.
She didn't leave because of you.
She left because
I couldn't understand her.
I wanted her to do what all other
mothers do all their lives...
... tending the family and doing
household chores.
But she wanted to do something else.
And she tried to reason with me.
But I was too involved
with my life and myself.
And do you know why she
stayed back so long with us?
That's because she loved you, son.
She didn't leave us because of you.
She left because of me.
Now, go to sleep.
Let's start a new life from
tomorrow... you and me.
- Let's have another ride. - No.
I'm tired. Go on. Play by yourself.
You've changed so completely, Rohit.
I only wish Kiran should've
seen you in these spirits.
- Don't talk about Kiran.
- Very well.
- Tell me the truth... don't you
ever think about her? - Not at all.
Look at me, Daddy!
- Don't do that, Sunil.
- No! It's my turn now!
- Don't you think about your husband?
- His case was quite different.
- He had started having an affair.
- Really? I had no idea. Who was it?
He had this girl in his office. And
my Romeo wanted to bring her home.
What nonsense!
Look at me now, Daddy!
I'm coming down standing up!
- No, Sonu. What are you up to?
Get down. - I'll get him down.
- What happened afterwards? - I told
him he was free to do what he liked.
But I wouldn't let go of the house.
It's for my children and me.
- No! Sonu!
- Watch your step, Sonu!
What's happened, Sonu?!
Take him to a hospital. Hurry!
Nothing's going to happen to you,
Sonu. You're going to be all right.
I'll treat you
to ice creams afterwards.
I'm Ravinder Kapoor. I'm the chief
assistant director in RP Films.
- I see. - I have come
here for a sound transfer.
I saw your friend all of a sudden.
She's very good.
My director wants a smart girl as he
is about to shoot an important scene.
The role is that of a friend
to the leading lady.
No. Not stand-by.
You don't know Mr. Kapoor.
That's right. Mr. Paresh Kapoor.
- You must've seen his film last
year. - Yes. - It was a super hit.
It's still raking in royalties.
- How many days is she to work
at it? - It's only a day's shoot.
- But...
- How much money will she make?
2000. And I'll make sure she
gets 100 bucks as conveyance.
- I'll speak to her about it.
- Please do try. I'll wait for you.
l've dumped Sunju.
He says that I'm selfish.
He asked me why I went to see
a film when he was sick.
I couldn't bore myself sitting
by him all evening; now could l?
Have I done anything wrong?
Tell me, Anjali... have
I done anything wrong?
You were supposed to
deliver your lines.
Don't you remember your lines?
Will she be able to
deliver the lines?
You wanted someone simple and
innocent. She'll deliver all right.
Didn't I tell you that I don't
know anything about acting?
All you have to do
is to my your lines.
Tell me, Anjali...
What have I done wrong?
You haven't done
the right thing, Deepa.
D'you remember how anxious he
was when you had fallen sick?
He kept by you and cared
for you like a man possessed.
And you can't even spare
an evening for him!
You call that boredom.
The truth is that you've
never even understood Sunju.
He loves you very much.
She's going on saying
whatever she wants to.
l'd told you earlier that l
know nothing about acting.
I tried it at my friend's instance.
I really want to become a singer.
- Very well... you may sing some.
- Sir...?!
- Please listen to the songs I've
scored. - I've helped you already.
I introduced you to Amar Kaushik.
And you've disgraced me.
- They started misbehaving with me.
- Will they really misbehave?
- You see, Mr.Gulbadan. - You see,
Mr. Rohit, I merely run...
.. a small-time music company. We
only publish records and cassettes.
I'm not a film producer.
Now, please excuse me.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Please take your time.
One minute, Mr. Rohit.
I can help you sell your songs.
Amar Kaushik needs new tunes.
I'll get you 2000 for each tune.
- Here's my card. - So they get
the credit for my compositions.
Why bother about the credit?
You want me to give you a job so
you can walk out on me again.
That won't happen ever again. I beg
your pardon. Please give me a chance.
- lsn't that, Mrs. Kiran?
- Yes. She's Rohit Kumar's wife.
- She's made a heroine in films.
- She used to sing.
And now, she's up to
dancing in public.
Come quickly, Dad.
Take a look... over there.
It's Mummy's picture.
They put up the posters today.
I want to see Mummy's film. You'll
take me to see it, won't you?
You'll take me, won't you, Daddy?...
Won't you, Daddy? Please tell me.
