My dear (Fatima).
Behrouz Parastouyi, Behrouz Shafeii
Naser Monfared, Shahram Shadman
I prefer to talk to you.
I feel calmer addressing you.
Tonight is the last night of the year.
Tomorrow the New Year will arrive.
We must felicitate.
I can't remember writing any
letters for you.
No, I do!
I have written a few wills.
Writing a will is much easier.
In a will, I don't need to
bring reasons, but now...
Writing is difficult.
Especially when you're under
the red light of a siren.
The electricity is cut.
One of the guests is snoring.
But some eyes glitter in this darkness.
No one is talking.
A large number of forces are
entrenched outside and God knows...
how much they're cursing me for
ruining the last night of the year for them.
By the way (Abas) is also here.
The poor guy, doesn't know what to do.
I wish he hadn't come here.
I wish (Salman)...
(Fatima)!
This boy thinks he's
so distant from me.
Photography:
Mitra Mahaseni
But I can see myself in his face.
Set manager:
Hussein Khallili
Tomorrow is a difficult day.
Very difficult.
No one knows what's going to happen.
I guess they won't pardon me.
First assistant and programmer:
Hamidreza Charakchian
It's unlikely that I can
get away with this.
When I think about tomorrow,
I can't concentrate.
I wish...
I don't have time to beat around
the bush. I have to tell you...
...why we came, we arrested, we
stayed and what we want.

Mehrdad Mirkiani
(Fatima)!
I'm so stupid to think
you'll receive these writings!
Sound recordist:
Mahmoud Samakbashi
I would've done the same,
if I were in their shoes.
Sound mix:
Mohsen Roshan
I won't criticize them for this at all.
Music:
Majid Entezami
But I hope they understand me as well.
I don't expect them to give
me any right.
Edit:
Haydeh Safyari
I just want them to understand.
I'll attack, if they attack.
Production manager:
Mehdi Karimi
I'll wound, if they wound.
Cinematography manager:

Oh God!
I swear you to (Fatima)'s
life to help me!

(Abas)!
(Abas)!
(Abas Heydari)!
What are you doing here'?
Dude, it's not your house's roof!
What the hell is wrong with you'?
I'm talking to you!
I hadn't heard from him for years.
He was the R.P.G operator of my battalion,
from the Mashhad suburbs.
He said he's here for treatment.
He couldn't continue farming.
His body had shrunk.
It wasn't right to leave
him alone in this crowded city.
But (Abas) had come to
Tehran at the wrong time.
Exactly the night before the New Year.
(Ham).
Excuse me, we better leave.
Yes.
You want to leave?!
Yes. Please come
to Mashhad with your family.
We're familiar with Tehran.
You're busy the night before the New Year.
From now on when you want to insult me,
let me know beforehand.
Because I have a weak heart.
Let's go!
Okay.
Get in!
Okay (Ham)-
I will.
Just obey and come.
On this night people think
about their own feast.
Wherever we went they asked for
money to hospitalize (Abas) immediately.
(Abas) and his wife insisted
that I leave them...
...with their pain and
get on with my work.
But I couldn't...
I remembered (Bahman).
He was a Basiji, who
had become a doctor.
I knew his whereabouts.
I thought he could help.
Sir!
Who allowed you to come in'?
We're looking for Dr. (Bahman).
Get out!
Wait outside.
What's wrong sir'?
Doctor is one of my old friends.
Wait outside.
He'll be with you.
Please sir!
Okay!
Okay man!
Let's go (Hajji).
No need to shout!
Wait a minute!
(Hajji), you're a fighter
like always!
What happened to your beard doc'?
Well!
I guess you're here for
an urgent matter.
I'm at your service.
Tell him (Abas)!
I think he hasn't recognized me.
Don't worry. He knows you.
Valfajr 8, Khosro Abad, the boar
that got stuck in the medical tent.
We were being bombed,
I operated the R.P.G...
You don't remember me.
Don't you remember (Abas)?
How can I not remember him'?
Mr. (Heydari).
(Panjali), (Shafeii), (Kowsari), (Harirchi),
(Hajibashi), (Gholamzadeh)...
All of them got martyred.
Well, what's your problem'?
In general I'm fine.
Then why is your hand numb'?
It gets numb and after a
while, it gets better.
Doctor, his leg is numb.
He falls down...
My leg gets numb and then
it's okay after a while.
He can't see.
He gets blind
Only one eye!
My sight comes and goes.
Can't I see'?
I feel sorry for him.
I've got used to it.
Every time this happens
I sit down and it gets better.
I don't have any problems.
If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be in
Tehran right before the New Year.
I wouldn't bother (Hajji) as well.
- Are you his wife'?
- Yes, hello. How are you'?
I congratulate you.
(Abas) has always been like this.
During war he used to flee and go to the war zone.
He wouldn't stay in any hospital.
What can I say'?
Now the war has ended.
When did you get wounded'?
I can't remember the exact date.
This happened to me a few times. They
hospitalized me and I rah away to the war zone.
When did your neck get wounded'?
Can you remember'?
I can't remember.
I see!
But I remember.
It was during Karbala 5. I pulled you back.
This skinny guy from Mashhad...
had made such a chaos
with a wound and his R.P.G...
(Hajji)! Stop it.
He didn't ask for the whole story!
It was the year 1986 doctor.
Mr. (Heydari).
A shrapnel is moving in your neck.
You can put your clothes on.
Doctor.
Wear it.
You'll catch a cold.
The doctors used their
own medical terms.
At first I didn't understand at all.
But then I heard what
I shouldn't have.
The shrapnel in (Abas)'s neck, which
couldn't be touched during the war...
and probably had to
move away from the jugular vein...
has now moved around and
is putting pressure on the vein.
(Abas)'s numbness is because the blood
that flows to the brain becomes clotted.
For a few seconds it disconnects
the brain from the body organs.
If you want my opinion...
although we have good doctors here...
I suggest...
Mr. (Heydari) to be
recruited immediately.
I suggest London.
Actually the hospital I have on
mind has an Iranian surgeon.
He travels to Iran periodically.
But now he's in London.
I can talk to him.
Here you are.
How much time do we have doctor'?
Please.
It's a difficult question.
I can't give you any time.
The sooner the better.
Even now is better than
an hour from now.
But you should be able to
define something doctor.
Dr. (Bahman), this is so unlikely of you.
This isn't in my hands.
Maybe 3 days.
Maybe it's even too late now.
Please!
Thank you.
Can't something be done in Iran'?
It's possible but the
success rate will drop.
It's not only a matter of expertise.
The equipment is also important.
Excuse me.
Tell me what's going on.
Shall I lie or tell you the truth'?
Please lady.
Thank you.
Have it!
Thank you.
Well, we better not bother
the doctor anymore.
I'll tell you on the way.
No (Hajji)!
He better explain it for him.
Go ahead doctor.
The shrapnel has moved
towards your jugular vein.
Mr. (Heydari), you have to
be operated immediately.
I'll use a Protez so that you
don't move your neck too much.
Mr. (Heydari), I won't prescribe
any medication for now.
You only have one choice.
You better take it seriously.
But it can be dangerous,
if you ignore it.
Are you listening'?
Yes.
Pay attention Mrs. (Heydari)!
You have to help.
Anxiety and nervousness can directly
affect the movement of this shrapnel.
If these things aren't controlled...
it would move faster.
But if...
he stays calm, hopefully...
I emphasize, hopefully the
movement will be minimum.
Of course I can't predict that...
...he won't get angry
until his operation.
But if something bothers you...
...you have to forget it immediately.
Try to stay calm.
I mean...
...you should always have a
smile on your face.
A real smile...
can prevent danger.
Excuse me.
Right! That's it!
It's a wreck (Hajji).
No matter what I do, it boils.
I was so confused.
God bless (Bahman) for paying attention.
He gave us hope and divided our duties.
He was supposed to get the
pass and visa for England.
I had to go after the
money, ticket and hospital.
And most important of all,
the foundation.
Dude!
I've asked everyone not to stand here!
More power to you.
What?!
I said more power to you!
Thank you.
I swear it isn't my fault.
Either I work or you work.
It can't go on like this.
Do your work sir.
I don't think you'd be able to deliver on time.
Did I invite you'?
I'm an employee like you.
That's your duty and this is mine.
What a nuisance!
Excuse me, what happened
to Mr. (Heydari)'s file'?
Are You (Heydari)?
(Abas)?
No, it's him.
Hello. How are you'?
Are you (Abas Heydari)?
Yes.
Hello.
Your file has been studied, the
medical commission has to decide...
...whether you should be urgently
recruited to London or be treated here.
That's it!
Thank you man.
So we'll leave.
Sir!
Sir!
When is this commission being held?
Can't you see the situation'?
God willing after the New Year holidays.
Sir, my brother's condition is critical.
- He can't wait that long.
- All patients are the same.
I couldn't convince him.
He even criticized me for going to
a doctor and applying for a visa.
I was about to lose hope that
a war wounded helped me out.
He made me understand
we only have one choice.
To go to London directly and
make them face a done deal.
We have an embassy there,
London is full of Muslims.
We can even get help
from the Pakistani Shiites.
It was the best and easiest suggestion
under the current circumstances.
But now something had
become clearer for us.
Money!
I tried to get money for 2 whole days.
But no one could help me out.
Don't spill water here!
Let me clean it and then you can wash it!
Wasn't I supposed to
wash the car for you'?
Okay, you can wash it later on.
I'm in a hurry now.
Shall I wash here'?
No!
What about here'?
(Abouzar), let me get on
with my work!
Then where shall I wash?
Stop it!
Sorry for the bother.
Hold the water away.
Hello doctor.
Welcome.
- Doesn't the bell work'?
- No, it...
You're the best man!
You got it in 2 days'?
I thought it'd be more
complicated than this.
It was complicated.
But I did my share anyway.
A 3 month visa for you and (Abas).
Don't touch these!
What about his wife's visa?
They didn't issue it.
I knew they'd only
give visa to 2 of you.
But not to a married couple.
Wouldn't it be better if
your father goes to London'?
This makes our job difficult.
Why'?
Don't forget to examine the shrapnel
in your waist when you get there.
Take your medical file with you.
Forget it doctor. I had even forgotten
that it's sitting in my waist.
I always tell you but you don't listen.
Come on doctor.
It's your own doing.
Is this how you thank me'?!
I couldn't have done
better in a field hospital.
I kept asking you to leave,
but you didn't.
Stop talking so much here.
Let's go in and have tea.
Come on!
I have to go.
Just a cup of tea...
Be at the airport the
day after tomorrow.
Aren't you done yet'?
If this rascal allows me,
I'll finish it.
Come down!
I think they're arguing.
I'm embarrassed to say anything.
I wanted to say something.
You shouldn't do this.
(Salman)!
I said don't interfere!
But I think I have the right to do so.
What's wrong'?
Why are you washing
the car so late at night?
It's obvious.
Lower your voice.
It's no time for this.
I disagree!
Do you even know (Abas)?
But mom, (Abouzar)
and I are closer to you.
Would you understand if I tell you,
mom (Abouzar) and you owe (Abas)?
The war is over.
Let's talk about now.
That car isn't only yours.
(Kazem)
Go.
(Salman) has enough time
to think about these things.
I've heard London is a nice place.
Have a nice time!
What's wrong'?
(Narges) is making a big fuss.
Am I making a fuss'?
Here.
He wants to travel alone.
Why alone?
I'm with him.
That's the problem.
So you've made your arrangements
and you don't want me to come.
Oh my God!
Can you explain (Hajji)?
Is that place appropriate
for people like (Narges)?
Why isn't it appropriate'?
Don't do this (Hajji)!
We shouldn't take a woman along.
The mouse couldn't go through a hole...
it tied a broom to its tail'?!
So I'm the broom!
(Hajji), I don't want these.
I want to come.
I want to come with you.
On (Merges)!
Why are you doing this'?
You're embarrassing us.
The last day of the year.
This was the only New Year,
which I didn't want it to arrive.
I only had half a day left.
I had to meet the
buyer at the agency.
To get the money from him
and pay for the tickets.
Hello.
Can I make a phone call'?
Are you sure you're leaving tomorrow?
Yes, as you can see I have a visa.
It's an emergency.
Listen sir! I respect Dr. (Bahman)...
...that's why I haven't
cancelled your booking yet.
But if the agency loses 2 passengers,
I'd be blamed for it.
I have 2 waiting list
passengers for London.
Tell me if you're not leaving.
What are you talking about?
There's a problem, which will be solved
immediately. I just have to make a phone call.
Excuse me.
Mr. (Nemati)...
He's not there'?
When did he leave'?
Then who knows'?
Don't bother me.
Get out!
I just want some water.
Go away!
If I go away, on this winter day!
I'm thirsty.
Let me drink some water.
Wait here, I'll bring it for you.
You know me, don't you'?
No, I don't.
I'm the one who you loved.
The one you couldn't live without.
It's there.
Please, let me have some water.
Can I help you'?
He's with me.
Excuse me.
I don't want to leave!
What's wrong'?
I don't want to go to
London or anywhere else.
I want to go back to my farm.
What do you mean'?
I mean I've changed my mind.
(Narges) and I have plans
for the New Year.
I want to be home for
the New Year arrival.
That's all!
Wait a minute.
Has anyone told you anything?
Has your wife changed your mind'?
No, it's my own decision.
It's better like this.
Do I have to give this to you'?
What the hell is wrong with you'?
Sit!
There's no need to sit.
Give me that paper lady!
Just give back the tickets
and let's leave.
There's no need to sit (Hajji)!
Man, the doctor said
you shouldn't get angry...
Forget it (Ham)-
Do you want me to smile and tell you'?!
Such ridicule isn't good for you and me.
Smile (Abas)!
(Hajji), return the tickets.
Smile!
(Ham, let-s go.
(Hajji), let's leave.
You asked for it.
(Hajji)!
Do you have ants in your pants'?!
Why is he acting like this'?
Okay!
Stop it.
Well done.
Damn you!
Who asked you to come here'?
(Salman)?
(Hajji) don't you love your kids'?
Huh'?!
Come here!
Look at him.
How did you gather the money'?
It seems the shrapnel has hit
your brain and not your vein!
Whatever, where did you
get this money from'?
(Hajji) still has some credit.
You've underestimated him.
Go home!
I'll come.
No! We'll go together.
It might take long.
Go, I'll be back soon.
No.
No'?
No.
No'?
No.
Come here.
Sit here and don't
move until I come.
Okay.
Don't worry.
I think it will be solved.
You're among the first London
passengers on the waiting list.
This means if only two
passengers cancel...
automatically you will be confirmed.
Most probably two passengers
from this agency will cancel...
How can I help'?
Do you need anything'?
I'll wait until you're done.
They're my guests.
How can I help you'?
Excuse me.
Sir.
Yes'?
Car keys.
The car paper.
What are these'?
And the deed.
What shall I do with them'?
I'll tell you right away.
Don't you close in the afternoon?
Yes, so what'?
Isn't there a flight for
London tomorrow?
I think so.
But...
Why are you asking
these from me'?
Don't you have the details?
We have to fly to London tomorrow.
They were supposed to bring
money for the tickets.
I don't why it hasn't
reached here yet.
Keep these as guarantee
and issue the tickets.
I will give you the
money this afternoon.
Excuse me sir!
But I can't do this.
I think you've come here by mistake.
Isn't this the manager's office?
Your colleague said you're
the only one who can decide.
That lady is cancelling our booking.
I understand.
But this isn't a problem.
We can book you on another flight.
By then your problem will be solved.
Right?
That means next week.
With a foreign airline.
It's a bit more expensive.
But less than a week.
It's not possible sir.
It's an emergency.
Everyone has a problem.
I have a problem as well.
I'm sorry.
I was talking about the Shengen members.
The members of this agreement,
I mean Germany, Spain, France...
Netherlands, Luxemburg...
and Greece and Italy,
which are joining them...
Having visa for one of these
countries is enough to enter the rest.
One month isn't even enough
to visit all of these countries.
Thank God, you don't have
any financial problems.
Mr. (Ahmadi), who allowed
this man to come in'?
Send him away.
Throw him out!
Sir.
My friend is in a critical condition.
He has to go to London.
Who's in a critical condition'?
That man, do you see him'?
I can't see anyone but this clown.
Which clown'?!
Come here.
The one sitting there.
He has a neck brace.
Sir, he seems to be
healthier than me.
Mr. (Ahmadi), thanks a lot!
What you did was enough
to disgrace the agency.
Will you help if I bring
his medical file'?
No sir, I can't help you.
If you wait, I promise to send
you with the next flight.
I wouldn't have insisted
if it were for me.
You're trying my patience.
Sir, this isn't my duty. Each person
has certain responsibilities.
Please get help from those responsible.
Ask them to fix your problem.
This young man has fought
for this country and you!
For you, who's calmly sitting
in this aquarium now.
I'm not begging.
I'm telling you my problem.
Sir!
Please stop it!
You're asking for the impossible.
Brother.
I don't have a car showroom here.
And I don't have a secret
budget for special cases.
I'm only an employee.
Like you.
Please go to counter number 3.
Ms. (Gharechedaghi) will
look into your matter.
Thank you.
Have fun.
I knew you'd help me out.
Thank you so much.
Please.
Ms. (Gharechedaghi),
I've sent them to you.
Please see what
you can do for them.
Okay.
Great timing for a
clown to walk in here.
(Hussein).
Did you cancel it'?
Cancel what'?
Did you cancel our tickets'?
Stop it man!
Let me get on with my work.
God, what clients do we have to
deal with on the last night of the year!
That stranger, who issued the visa,
had more loyalty than you, an Iranian!
Sir!
Stop insulting me!
Get out!
Please, leave!
Tell me.
Did you get permission
from me for 8 years of war...
...that you've come here
to get your rights from me'?
Go and seek help from
those who sent you there.
Please leave!
This isn't a charity center.
I've been putting up
with you for an hour!
I think his words tore my eardrum
and I couldn't hear anything.
I hadn't felt like this for many years.
I could only see the moment of attack.
I'm scared.
(Hajji). what's going on'?
Just watch.
I'm scared mom.
You should've moved!
We haven't done anything.
Where are you going'?
He'll shoot you!
Brother.
Let me go.
I don't even belong here.
(Ham).
I beg you.
I'm at your service.
(Hajji), I don't know what's going on.
For God's sake, tell me.
I'm about to have a heart attack.
(Hajji), say something!
Tell me what's going on.
(Hajji)!
Just like these people I don't
know what's going on.
Do you want me to join them as well'?!
Just wait and watch.
You've become too hasty (Abas).
Sir, can you tell me
what's going on here'?
Son, is your buddy traumatized'?
What does traumatized mean'?!
Traumatized'?!
It means traumatized!
They're not traumatized,
they're materialized!
You better keep this.
It's safer with you.
I'll solve the problem.
Do you think you're in Texas, man'?!
We did not expect this from thou.
Don't come closer!
If you want to know why
we're here, I'll tell you briefly.
Tomorrow there is a flight
from Mehrabad to London.
My fellow companion and
I have to be on that flight.
If you send us...
...we'll be gone for good.
But if you don't...
all those here will be our witnesses.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
And don't forget this game
can only continue till tomorrow.
That's all!
What are you saying for yourself?
My wife ran away.
We have 2 tickets. We'll give
them to you if you let us leave.
We just wanted to go to Germany
to visit our damn son...
This is Major (Namvar) speaking.
I want to talk to you face to face.
Please stay calm so we can negotiate.
Are you ready for negotiation'?
Who has the keys to this lock'?
I asked who has the key'?
(Mash Ghafour)!
Yes'?
Give the key to that man.
Which man'?
That one.
I can't!
Give it!
Then you can't hold me responsible!
I said go and give it to him!
Are you afraid of me'?
Why should I be afraid?
Of course I am.
You're holding a gun.
Just come and open it.
(Mash Ghafour).
The key!
You can come in.
You have 2 minutes.
Lower it half way down.
Mom! Police!
Sir, please save the kids and women.
We're helpless.
Calm down!
Calm down mother.
Be quiet!
Let him talk!
Calm down and everything will be solved.
I'm not armed.
I hope so.
You only have one demand. Right?
Yes.
Don't you want any money'?
No!
We even have our visas.
Then why are you holding hostages'?
They're not hostages.
They're my witnesses.
What difference does it make?
A witness has the right to leave.
Can they leave'?
I told you what I had to say.
That man is your accomplice, right'?
No, I'm not.
Sir, they came together.
Which political party do you work for'?
None.
You can leave.
You mentioned your fellow
companion, are you Basijis'?
No, you heard me wrong.
Then what are we (Hajji)?
No, this has nothing
to do with being a Basiji.
Then what (Hajji)?
Are we thieves'?
Murderers'?
I have to know who you are.
We're just your countrymen.
A driver, a farmer.
A fellow citizen, is that clear'?
Is that all'?
Listen brother, I have to
remind you of something.
Fortunately I've noticed
you're not into such stuff.
What you're doing will
only make things worse.
We're thieves, murderers.
Don't talk nonsense (Abas)!
Listen sir!
May God forbid me from pulling
the trigger on an innocent man.
Be quiet!
Well done!
You fulfilled your duty.
If I were your commander...
I would've rewarded you.
All these people witnessed that
you endangered your life.
Now don't say a word...
and leave.
Wait!
Move it!
I said move!
Come on!
Turn around, turn around!
I can...
Stop talking!
Come out!
And you.
Come on lady!
Come here.
What you're doing is wrong.
Why did you come'?
He's my husband. He's sick.
You sir!
Come out.
And you lady.
Come here.
Turn around!
Father, you come as well.
Stop talking.
Turn around.
(Mash Ghafour), come here.
You come as well lady.
And the kid.
With her mother.
The rest of you move back.
All of you!
Well sir.
You did your job.
You can take them with you.
What about us'?!
Leave mother. Get out of here.
That's a sign. Don't go!
Go.
May God punish you for your sins.
It's such a pity.
Get out!
I won't leave.
Go (Mash Ghafour).
Leave.
Where can I go'?
Where can I spend the night?
He's telling you to leave.
Get out.
Go to my house.
(Hajji), please let me go.
I'm in trouble as it is.
I have nothing to do with this place.
I just came to have some water.
You keep picking on me.
I could've helped you.
It's not too late.
I know it's not the right
time to tell a story.
But I want to tell you a story.
I won't take much of your time.
Once upon a time...
...there was a nice and beautiful town.
The people were strong and firm.
Everyone was celebrating.
Celebrating their honor.
Everyone was happy that suddenly
a monster attacks their feast.
A hungry monster that
wanted to gobble up the town.
Everyone was worried.
They were thinking how
to get rid of the monster.
We're languished from the feast.
We better not fight.
But the wise man of the city said...
...the young have to fight the monster.
So the youngsters were chosen.
Youngsters, who wanted to brag,
went to fight the monster.
The monster was strange.
When they cut off one leg,
two legs grew instead.
When they cut off his hand,
he grew several heads.
To make it short...
...they managed to kill the monster and
returned to their city tired and wounded.
They noticed their
spiritual leader has left.
So one of the young
experienced men replaced him.
But something had happened.
Some of them looked at these
young men as if they were strangers.
Maybe they had every right to do so.
Because these youngsters had been away
fighting with the monster for a long time.
Fighting the monster had
its own rituals.
They had got used to these rituals.
Fighting the monster had made them pure.
They had become like the
“companions of the cave".
Their money had no value.
Some of them crawled into their heart's cave
and others were forced to deal with the people.
I don't know you.
But if you speak Farsi like us,
you'd know what this honor means.
This honor is fading away.
The vein, in which this
honor is flowing...
Help us and don't let this happen.
I just want you to
have patience. That's all!
My name is (Nadia).
I don't live in Iran.
My family lives in Switzerland.
I came to Iran after many years.
To be honest, I don't know you.
I have heard things about you,
but I don't think it's sufficient.
And I didn't understand
anything from the story you told.
But if I'm not mistaken...
I can write a check
for any amount you want.
I have cash and international checks
that you can cash anywhere.
Just allow me to be next to my
parents for the arrival of the New Year.
That's why I came to Iran.
Listen sir.
I'm a merchant.
My life is in Dubai.
Take these checks and
I can even give you cash.
You and your family can
be my guests for a month.
You really need to relax.
Listen young man.
Have you thought with whose
money you fought that monster'?
It was the money coming
from me and others like me.
This isn't your solution. Like all your friends
you should've paid a visit to us .
I could've offered you a
chartered plane.
Making the wrong move
has consequences.
My dear, excuse me.
Listen (HEM-
If I were you, I'd teach a lesson
to all of these rich people.
And I'd help needy people like me.
Dude, just calm down for a minute.
Don't even help me,
if you don't feel like it.
Just let me make some money
this last day of the year.
I promise that tomorrow...
I'm a student.
I want to visit my
parents for the holidays.
Until now, I always took your side
but I won't do that anymore.
Sir!
How much do I have to
pay to be able to leave'?
The money is in my wife's handbag.
I'll give whatever you want.
Why are you acting like this'?
I have the solution to this problem.
I'll issue your ticket right away.
Okay.
You won't have any problems
leaving the country.
I'll issue a first class ticket.
Is it a deal?
Just tell us what you want.
Did I sound like I'm begging'?
I didn't ask for money.
Are you acting dumb or
are you really that naive'?
If we leave this place,
will they let us get to the airport'?
Go.
I'm at your service.
Go back.
I said go back!
I don't know what kind of
myth you'll turn me into later on.
Godspeed!
Thank you.
Listen to me sir.
I've been crying
like hell since morning.
It's my father's funeral. He won't let me leave.
Help me!
Please, at least convince
him to release the ladies.
Why don't you understand our situation?
Why don't you do something'?
Son, you don't seem to be a bad person.
Please.
Ask your friend to release the ladies.
Come here!
Stop begging!
I said come here!
(Hajji), let them leave.
They have problems just like us.
(Abas), would you like to be on
the second floor or the first floor'?
(Hajji), they're scared to death.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
I don't think they'll let us in,
on the second floor.
That's where the classy ones go.
We have to choose the buffet.
Why did you let that woman leave'?
I don't know.
You don't know?!
(Hajji), I'm not content
with what you're doing.
I'm not content to
threaten people with a gun.
(Hajji), please.
Why do you want to ruin
the end of the story like this'?
I swear to God, I had only
come to talk like a fellow citizen.
That's all!
That's their least share in this!
Share'?!
From these creatures of God'?
I don't want such a share.
We made a deal with God, not with them.
For God's sake let them go.
You always call me (Hajji), but you
know I've never been to Mecca.
All (Imam Ali)'s soldiers are (Hajjis).
Well warrior, do you still
believe in me'?
Yes, but those soldiers are silent.
They don't shout out.
I agree but right now
they're holding your breath.
Even better!
I won't let them.
This wasn't what we agreed.
You gave your youth.
(Hajji), this isn't the right solution.
I swear to (Imam Ali),
this isn't the way.
The path you've chosen
is full of minefields.
Over there they volunteered to come.
Now you're forcing them to come.
Me'?!
Me (Abas)?
Yes.
I just want them to be
my witnesses for one night!
Tomorrow is what scares me (Hajji).
(Abas)!
Trust me (Abas).
I never make the wrong move.
Here son.
I've said what I want.
We're here for your demands.
There's nothing more to say.
Just give me what I want.
Nothing will happen
unless you convince us.
You! Come!
Me'?
Move out of the way.
I'm talking to you!
Come on.
Why me'?
What do you want from him'?
That's what I'm saying.
Go and open...
...the lock.
Hurry up!
Move it!
Okay.
You can come in.
(Hajj Kazem)!
Warrior, what are you doing here?
Wait (Ahmad)!
I have to search you.
That's all I needed!
I'm so sorry.
Don't forget.
One wrong move and my
hand might slip on the trigger.
They're training bullets, right'?
No, they're war bullets.
You know that G3s are dastards.
Have you forgotten?
No.
This man was my mentor. (Kazem).
Mr. Mentor!
Turn around.
Turn around (Ahmad).
If you won't get offended,
turn around young man.
I've passed my youth.
You feel too old.
Aren't you one of those who felt your rights
were oppressed by others after the war...
and now you've come to get them'?
I won't say something twice!
Turn around!
It seems you can't hear properly.
Come on (Hajji).
We're not armed. Trust me.
We made a deal.
Usually mentors don't
trust their students.
If you're not armed,
it means you're amateurs.
Take it out with your
left hand and throw it here.
Okay.
You disarmed the
10th Iraqi army division.
Now can we sit and negotiate'?
Okay, Mr. (Ahmad Kouhi).
Now I'm all ears.
He wants to talk to his student.
(Hajji), I can't believe
you're doing this.
Why'?
It's because of the times...
...the distance...
and you being too busy.
Mr. (Ahmad Kouhi).
Leave these for when he's in jail.
Where's your accomplice'?
You're too big headed, aren't you'?
Well done!
Shoot me!
Assume I'm a Baathi general.
For example (Maher Abdulrashid).
For God's sake put an end to this.
People are watching you.
Wait (Ahmad).
Oh my God.
He's (Abas Heydari), isn't he'?
(Abas) has nothing to do with this.
Do you remember when he got wounded?
Yes.
The shrapnel is still in his neck.
He has 3 days.
He needs to go to London.
Sir.
Please don't beat around the bush.
Get to the point.
So we have nothing to say.
(Hajji), at least let them know.
Point.
The point, mentor.
The bush...
My heart broke.
The glass broke.
An officer came.
His weapon got stuck in my hand.
Armed assault.
Do you know the sentence'?
I have nothing more to say.
You can leave now!
What are you saying (Hajji)?
I won't let you stay here like this!
(Hajji), I swear to God,
you're making things worse.
Do you know what it
means to take hostages'?
They're only witnesses (Ahmad).
For what'?
What if we don't want to
be your witness'?
They have a life.
Let them leave.
I can be your witness.
We'll board the plane tomorrow.
Once we board the plane, all of them
can go and celebrate the New Year.
Celebrate?
Mentor!
Have you seen too
many movies after the war'?
Bro, this isn't Texas.
Mr. (Salahshour), will you let me talk'?
You're not talking.
You're flirting!
Get to the point.
The end of the path.
This path has no end (Salahshour).
(Hajj Kazem) was the battalion
commander and (Abas) has fought.
Even worse.
Being one of us and doing
this is even a heavier crime.
This country has thousands of
domestic and foreign enemies.
We're fighting them
all day long. Aren't we'?
Then one of our own men points a gun
at us a night before the holidays.
Do you call this justice?
Do you know how many youngsters
have died to keep this country in peace'?
How many?
Tell me. Come on.
If you think properly, you'd be
embarrassed from what you're doing.
Who's the superior'?
Assume it's me.
Your friend is talking very clearly.
I like your frankness.
If I were you, I wouldn't say
these to a man sentenced to death.
I apologize.
I didn't get it.
You are totally right.
So what'?
Nothing, you said what'll
happen at the end.
No.
This isn't the end.
Send (Abas) away for his treatment.
I'll turn myself in.
Now you're talking.
Come.
Come and sit!
You know a lot of big shots,
who can reduce your punishment.
Give that to me!
Okay.
Is that all'?
I love wise men!
Now, I'll tell you about
the end of the path.
For me the end is a countdown.
Ten...
Nine...
Eight...
Seven...
Six...
Five...
Four...
(Hajji), for God's sake stop it.
Three...
Two...
I'll leave you...
and your mentor alone.
Listen (HEM-
I'll do whatever I can.
I'll do whatever it takes.
I prefer to deal with (Salahshour).
What?
So you don't trust me anymore'?
I do.
But this trust will weaken me
and also put you in trouble.
You better leave this to your friend.
(Ham).
Wait! Wait a minute!
You don't know him.
I know him well.
He's just like me.
I can handle him.
Give it to me brother.
Give it to me!
(Hajji), I promise to
resolve this problem.
For God's sake, put an end to this.
I assure you that (Abas)
will go to London for treatment.
He says he'll send him to London...
(Ahmad), don't force me to
start a countdown for you.
Don't you want (Abas) to go to London'?
Consider it done.
I can't release any of
the witnesses until...
...we board the plane and leave Iran.
Understand my situation.
(Hajji), I swear to (Imam Hussein)
I don't want to visit you in prison.
I swear to God, I'd fire you,
if I were your boss.
You don't know your job at all.
I can't talk to you.
I want to talk to (Abas).
Can I'?
It's up to you.
Listen to what I'm saying!
For me you and (Abas) are the same.
As much as I don't want anything to happen
to (Abas), I don't want you to get hurt as well.
You better leave this
to your friend and go.
This is better.
I'll talk to (Abas).
I have to confess something (Fatima).
I wish (Abas) had left
after talking to (Ahmad).
If this had happened...
...then (Abas) would've been safe.
I thought (Ahmad) is man
enough to send (Abas) away.
(Hajji), I'm ashamed.
I prefer to die...
and not witness such a day.
Don't think I'll go to England.
No.
Or to my farm.
No.
No!
L...
...won't even go to (Narges).
I'll leave because of you.
I've become a goner.
Hopefully, this time...
I won't fall behind
from the caravan.
Forgive me (Hajji).
Well done.
Well done (Abas).
Well done.
Well done.
That's enough!
Stop it!
What's the meaning of this'?
(Abas)
I'm not coming (Ahmad)!
What are you talking about'?!
I told you everything.
Go for God's sake.
This is to (Hajji)'s benefit.
I beg you to go.
Why don't you get it (Abas)?
It's not to your benefit.
I can't leave him alone.
If you leave, you won't be
turning your back on him.
At least have mercy on yourself.
The hell with me!
(Abas)
(Abas)
Don't abject me these last moments.
(Abas)
He sat down again.
Man, why did you act like this'?
We've become puppets for these kids.
We're suffering here!
I disagree with them as well.
I wish I had such buddies.
You're approving their dirty act.
Yes, they're making us suffer.
They have to go after those
who are plundering millions.
Someone has to ask
them why they fought'?!
We paid our taxes
for the army to go to war.
Only the army'?
What about these Basijis'?
What time is it'?
Go and talk to them.
I want to see how my wife is.
One of us must talk to them
so that they release us.
They're too merciless to talk to.
Didn't you see the
tears in their eyes'?
They'll kill us with the same tears.
Mark my words!
Haven't I seen you at the front?
Please pray for me.
Give him some space.
I doubt thou will reach thy
destination through this path.
Halt!
I'll shoot!
Move back.
Don't stand in front of the door.
Move away!
(Hajji)!
(Hajji), open the door.
Open it (Ham)-
I said open the door.
It was (Asghar).
(Hajji)!
(Hajji), I've come to join you.
Why is (Asghar) here'?
I don't care.
He better not interfere.
I haven't seen him for many years.
I want to see him (Hajji).
(Asghar)!
My dear, in which operation
did you seize this place?
Valfajr 9 or Karbala 10'?
Shut up!
You cowards, all alone?
What about your friends and...
brothers'?
Damn this luck!
Why did you come here'?
I'm not alone.
All the guys are here.
The bikers are your friends?
I know, but I'm afraid to
say they're your friends.
Do you know when the last
time I saw you was'?
You still smell of gunpowder.
Who told you I've come'?
Someone reported that
(Hajji) needs money.
What happened'?
Tell me!
They said (Hajji) needs
money and I called you...
What's wrong with you'?
It's because of my shoes.
His wife said he's at the agency.
I got it.
I searched all over Tehran to find you.
(Hajji), call your wife.
She's worried.
(Hajji), when did you captivate him'?
Did you see (Ahmad Kouhi)?
How come'?
Did you?
Yes.
What did he tell you'?
The same things you told him.
What did I tell him'?
(Hajji), are you interrogating me'?
I have to search you.
(Hajji), what are you doing'?
I have to (Abas).
What if I don't let you'?
I'll insist.
What if I don't accept'?
I'll beg.
What if I don't listen'?
I'll fall on my knees.
Search him (Abas).
(Hajji), I'm here to accompany you.
Accompany me'?
Have they come for the same reason'?
Yes.
Yes, they're on your side.
They've made a mistake.
Those bikes need an audience.
I don't like such shows.
Who gave this to you'?
Make your phone call.
It's none of your business.
We have a phone here.
No, they're all disconnected.
(Asghar), what happened to your sleeve'?
God had mercy I only tore my sleeve.
How did you find out'?
Yes.
(Ahmad Kouhi) gave it.
Call them.
- Who'?
- The bikers.
To say what'?
Tell them to leave.
Leave'?!
(Hajji), they're here for
of you and (Abas).
The smoke of their exhausts
will choke (Abas) and me.
Ask them to leave.
What shall I tell them'?
Tell them this prescription
is only for me.
I'm (Imam Ali)'s soldier.
From the land of bamboos...
...wetlands and water.
His soldiers are silent.
They burn without any smoke.
Hello.
Is it you (Hajj Hussein)?
Listen up.
Ask the guys to leave.
(Hajji) doesn't consider them as friends.
He wants to talk to you.
He doesn't want to talk.
Stop preaching me.
No, I'll stay.
Bye.
I'm ready.
This guy got on the plane.
He said would you go to London or not'?
The pilot said...
...But you're not armed.
He replied. I know, do you always
have to be forced with a gun'?
(Hajji), I'm at your service.
I'll do whatever you want.
On (Imam Ali).
On (Imam Ali).
Whoever wants to call
his family can use this phone.
I have a cell phone, can I use it'?
Go ahead.
I don't need this man!
I have to leave.
I gave you a phone
to call your family.
The hell with my family dude!
I feel sick. Let me leave
for (Abas)'s sake.
We'll all leave together
when the time comes.
I won't even set foot
in heaven with you!
Listen!
If I don't leave, you'll have
a corpse on your hands.
Then they'd say you
killed an innocent man.
My dear.
Let me kiss your gun.
Listen.
Don't disgrace me.
I have to have my stuff!
Do you want me to help you'?
I have bullets and gunpowder.
Would it help'?
I could guess what
they're saying about us.
Damn me, if I set foot here again.
I wouldn't settle for less than a
few curses, if I were in their shoes.
But what can I do (Fatima)?
What can I do when
there's no time to speak?
There's no time to understand.
God, what's breaking all
of these hearts worth'?
Dad, don't you have
anyone to do something?
They already know me.
No, just assume the disciplinary
forces have arrested us.
Dude, many big fish come and
go and nothing happens.
Foreign affairs is better.
Like the desert stars.
I got the tickets.
(Mash Ghafour)'s shoes.
The woman ran away.
I have to find her.
What shall I do with the tickets'?
I think I found my thesis
subject in this situation.
A messy obstinate man with a beard.
This woman is so closefisted.
I lose man!
Leave me alone!
The hell with the workers.
I'm officially dead.
Saveh road.
Behind the railway,
the dusty alley. Damn!
Yes.
I'll be stuck here for a while.
I don't know. I swear, I don't know.
Do you remember how
we neglected (Ahmad)?
No.
He's just like him...
Take a painkiller and sleep.
Hold on!
Well done.
Well done.
Yes, the car was sparkling.
No one can do it like (Abouzar)...
What?
Which promise'?
Sure. Yes.
Now give the phone to your mom.
Hello...
Hello (Fatima)!
L...
It was so hard for me to talk to you.
I knew you wouldn't be able to
understand this comparison.
This trip was just like the
times I went to the front.
Very sudden and untimely.
(Fatima)!
I intended to tell you
the story a few times.
But I couldn't convince myself.
(Abouzar) and I had made so many
plans to travel to your homeland.
My dear (Fatima).
It was hard for me to tell
you to leave without me.
(Asghar)!
- What is it (Hajji)?
- Give the phone to (Abas).
(Hajji), look at the forces!
It's your wife.
Talk to her.
Now it was (Abas)'s turn to
suffer like a snake bitten victim.
He had to talk calmly so
that his wife won't find out.
I was only worried that
(Abas)'s words might not...
be like mine and that
you'd become suspicious.
(Hajji)!
How does this story end'?!
You could've watched from outside.
I'm not afraid.
Whose fault do you think it is'?
It's obvious.
Who'?
Me!
Can I talk to you'?
No, I have a cell phone.
Thank you.
He's (Abas). She's my wife.
Consider her as your sister.
Unfortunately she has forgotten
to bring her heart pills.
Her head is getting heavy.
She might face problems.
I wanted to kindly ask you...
how much our share is...
What share'?
The share we have
to pay for our freedom.
Don't get offended.
But what you're doing is
forceful and illogical.
I can't believe that all this
hassle is because of your sickness.
It's only an excuse, right'?
You're into politics and you're
using us for your political aims.
We all know you guys took
enough booties from this war.
Fridges, A/Cs, TVs,
plane tickets, scholarships...
and much more, which I'm not aware of.
What else do you want'?
What's wrong (Abas)?
Move out of the way!
You can leave!
All those who think
they've given us booties...
and we're overwhelmed
with joy, can leave!
I didn't have any expectations.
I worked on my farm with a truck.
When the war ended, I returned to my
land but this time I didn't have a truck.
I didn't even get my insurance policy.
And I cannot stand such slandering!
I can't hear such words!
I'm talking to you sister!
You've paid your share.
Your share was the
tongue-lashing you did.
Thank you so much!
Now leave before your
heart stops beating!
Get out!
Go!
He's letting you leave!
That's a sign. Don't go.
Wait!
(Hajji)!
(Asghar), let them leave.
She's my wife.
Man, she's my wife!
You'll be our guest for now.
Hello...
Yes, it's (Asghar).
Hold on.
Didn't I tell you to stop interfering
and let your colleague deal with me'?
No (Ahmad), I won't let you come.
Only your colleague.
That's final!
What shall I do (Hajji)?
Shall I open it'?
Open m
You weren't supposed to come!
I'll do the talking.
Why did you bring my son'?
I objected as well.
I brought him.
He wanted to see you.
Didn't you know better not
to get (Salman) involved'?!
Oh my God!
Is he alone?
Yes.
I'm ready.
- Can we talk in private?
- We don't have any strangers here.
It's better.
Okay!
What?
Go ahead.
Here'?
Yes.
As you wish.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
You can sit as well, mentor.
I'm fine.
I have done my investigations.
A mentor...
...who switched to moving passengers, is
in debt for his house, has a young son...
It's difficult.
What else?
Of course such people are rare,
but we can't deny that they exist...
Do you think it'll cost more than
one of these skyscrapers they build?
You prefer to keep an eye on us, right'?
How about exposing us in
a museum or zoo'?
You can even use him as a guinea pig!
Did I insult you'?
I'm being honest.
Have you ever been to the front?
Where I was didn't lack
anything from the front.
Do you know what it means when a battalion
is dispatched and a company returns'?
Do you know what it means when a company
is dispatched and a unit returns'?
Do you know what it means when a unit
is dispatched and a few soldiers return'?
Can I ask my questions now'?
Go ahead.
You must've seen Iran's map.
It's like a cat.
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan,
Afghanistan, Pakistan...
The tiny countries of the Persian Gulf,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Turkey...
Do you know what they
think about this cat'?
If you knew, you wouldn't have
allowed a mentor to disgrace us.
Your days are over mentor.
Who'd listen to you,
if you don't hold that gun'?
This is what bothers you.
You did whatever you liked for a
decade and we stayed silent.
You bragged and arrested
and we didn't utter a word.
We never said anything.
Now let us talk.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Do you want one of our neighbor
countries to attack us again?
Not at all!
God forbid, do you want
the war to start again'?
Not at all!
Stability!
Our decade is the decade of stability.
Safety!
When can this country be safe'?
When can it see stability?
When does your son have
to make plans for his future?
It's not even my decade,
it's your son's.
Get out!
Let go!
Let go of me (Ahmad)!
(Hajji)!
I swear to (Imam Khomeini)'s soul,
I'll shoot you.
Trust me, even if I had arrested you,
I would've said...
...you're a disgrace to the Basijis.
Don't waste your breath and
worry about your own decade.
I think I can smell its death.
You're mistaken.
This is the smell of the death
of your childish acts.
I want to tell you something mentor.
Do you know your heroism
is being broadcasted live'?
Do you know CNN and BBC
have you under the spotlight?
If we give in to your demands...
it means this country isn't safe.
You won't even be able to leave this agency,
let alone setting foot in London.
Calm down!
Do you know the foreign affairs'
has denied this situation'?
Do you know what it means'?
Let me clarify this.
It means no one by the name of (Kazem)...
and no one called (Abas),
exist anymore.
What do you mean'?
But we exist!
I'd like to thank you.
Is this good or bad'?
I'm sorry mentor.
What could've been easily
done by the right means...
has turned into a
national security issue...
because of your obstinacy.
Yes, that's true!
A national security issue!
Well!
Now it's better.
The sooner the better.
Otherwise...
What?
You'd execute us with a firing squad'?
(Asghar), don't interfere.
This has nothing to do with you.
(Abas)'s problem is a
problem for all of us.
The security you're bragging about...
is because of the existence
of people like (Abas).
Have you forgotten?
Mr. (Kouhi)!
This ruins everything.
It means whoever has a
gun can do as he wishes.
People got martyred!
So that people like (Kazem) become
bullies and do as they wish?!
Yes!
Man, don't make it worse than it is.
Be careful.
He'll shoot!
Leave him alone.
Let him talk.
(Ahmad).
His actions are defendable, aren't they'?
This prayer is void.
This place is seized!
He couldn't do anything as well.
Isn't there anyone to tell these
Muslims their prayer is void?
We even prayed in Iraq, how could
a prayer on our own soil be void'?
So may God accept!
(Hajji), pray for me.
May God accept.
I hope so.
Listen to me (Ahmad)!
The flight for London is
leaving tomorrow morning at 8.
As I've heard we have
to be there 3 hours ahead.
If you pull a few strings, we
can be there 2 hours before departure.
Okay.
Oh Saint (Abolfazl)!
I think they want to attack.
See if the street has any electricity.
Yes, only this place has gone dark.
Something is going on out there.
All these policemen have
come to save us.
What's all this fuss about?
We have electricity!
No, this is the emergency electricity.
Don't you understand
what's lawful and what isn't'?
Why are the men and
women sitting together'?
Move to that side!
Lady, I'm talking to you.
Do these people have any honor'?
If they did, they wouldn't
have kept us here.
Move it!
(Asghar)!
Leave them alone!
(Hajji)!
Let the ladies leave.
(Ahmad)!
You can take these ladies with you.
What shall I do (Ahmad)?
The ladies can leave.
Please!
- Really?
- Go.
- You mean I can go'?
- Yes, please.
Please leave. Go.
Hurry!
What about us sir'?
They've kept us here since morning.
Please calm down.
- What are you waiting for'?
- I won't leave.
Why'?
I'm working on my thesis.
The hell with your thesis!
Get out of here!
When are you going to end this game'?
It'll be over soon brother.
Nothing bad will happen.
Please.
Lady, please leave!
I'll only leave with my husband.
My wife won't go anywhere without me.
You're supposedly Muslims!
(Hajji), this is so unlikely of you.
Please.
Go sister!
Can I go instead of her'?
Me!
Only the women!
I'm a woman, I'm even
less than a woman!
I said only women!
Get out of here!
I won't!
You won't'?
Listen sir. You are
responsible for these men.
Nothing will happen!
Nothing will happen!
Lady, sister, please leave.
Please.
Come on get out.
It's no time for crying!
- Shut up!
- They shut me up a long time ago!
Come on, leave.
Wait!
Tomorrow 6 AM.
Send a Mercedes to take
us to the airport.
I swear to the prayers I said...
if the car isn't here at 6 AM...
...something bad will happen!
By 6:10 AM, two bad things will happen!
6:15 AM and 3 bad things will happen!
(Ahmad).
I swear I am capable of doing this.
Please do this before 6 AM.
(Hajji), don't make things worse.
It was obvious who'll lose
from the beginning.
Stop it!
You heard what you should've heard.
Tell them to choose between
BBC and (Abas).
To me (Abas) and people like him are
those who preserve the national security.
If BBC determines their
national security...
each of us better stick to
our own beliefs. That's it!
Excuse me (Hajji)!
How many groups and parties are you'?
Leave me alone!
What is your opinion and belief?
You're together, you pray together...
but you don't approve
and understand one another.
Can you do me a favor?
What?
Please bring my car papers and the keys.
Sure.
Why didn't you tell me before?
Come on, finish this.
(Salman)!
(Ham).
Don't scold him.
Hello dad.
Hello son, sit down!
You've been fined.
Sit down.
What's going on here'?
I think you've already heard everything.
You've forced these people to stay here.
I can't believe it.
Who told you to come here'?
Mom was worried.
She sent me.
Does she know anything'?
I don't know.
Here you are.
The keys...
Car papers...
...the deed and the rest of the stuff.
How nice.
Is he your son'?
You can leave now.
He said leave!
Take the car and go home.
If anyone stops you,
tell (Ahmad Kouhi).
Mom said I don't know you well enough.
Now I've come to know you.
But right now mom needs you more
than me.
You have to be home.
Dad.
Do you hate me'?
You've become the man of the house now.
Just make a promise to me.
Be nicer to people like (Abas).
Now go home, big man.
Why are you searching me'?
Take this!
What are these'?
These people are hungry.
Thank you man.
Where's (Hajji)?
He's the one with the flashlight.
I've come to take (Abas).
Hello. Welcome.
Do you see this (Kazem)?
Can you see what nature the
logic of war has left behind'?
You're a doctor and (Abas) is wounded.
Don't interfere in the details
and just do your job.
Where's (Abas)?
What if they've poisoned it'?
What are you talking about'?!
Here you are (Hajji).
Content am I, from the
day that went by.
Please.
Did you expect me to leave him alone?
With the fuss they've made, they'll
surely sentence (Hajji) to death.
No doctor, I couldn't have done that.
Do you agree with what he has done'?
You know (Hajji) doesn't look for trouble.
They've tread on his toes.
Whatever it is, you're the
key to this problem.
You better leave.
Don't disgrace me.
What kind of logic is this'?
My dear, I don't want to hear anything.
That's final!
Have one once every two hours.
You've disappointed me (Heydari)!
By the way...
...your wife is here to see you.
Talk to her.
Who asked her to come here'?
Who told (Narges) to come here'?
This is so unfair.
Instead of getting angry, which
is as bad as poison for you...
go out and talk to her.
Doctor.
Doctor!
If he's sick, he's sick as well.
If he's a human being, he's one as well.
You only care about your own people.
He's asthmatic. He doesn't
have any medication.
Okay, calm down!
You don't listen to anyone.
We've been begging since
morning and no one listens to us.
I'll take him with me.
(Abas)'s wife is outside.
I don't want her to come in.
Well, she's here now
and we can't do anything.
I'll talk to her on phone.
(Abas), what's wrong'?
I don't know. I can't
move my hand and leg.
You shouldn't get nervous and angry.
(Asghar)!
Yes (Hajji)?
(Asghar), why doesn't he laugh?
Why should he'?
Then why are you here'?
Come on, do something!
(Abas), do you remember the operation nights'?
When they fired a Dushka, we used to sing...
Bang, bang, bang,
We're the most scared gang!
Karbala 5...
...they had captivated an Iraq
I and they asked him to say...
Saddam is an oil barrel!
The old woman sold 2 eggs and
a Levis jeans to help the front.
Damn me that I can't
make this man laugh.
Canned fruit, if I see you,
I will hunt you down.
If I find you in a corner,
I will gobble you down.
I will have your cherries and
throw your stones down.
Yes!
I will have your cherries
and throw your stones...
(Abas), your wife is here.
Calm down!
Congratulations.
(Hajji), I can't see her.
I want you to act
like a classy groom.
Applaud our great groom.
He's the groom,
can't you see'?
He's the best,
can't you see'?
Oh my God, I don't want to
get ruined (Abas).
Don't shout.
Don't shout (Narges)!
Who asked you to come here'?
Didn't I call and ask you to stay home'?
I don't want to become a widow.
They want to kill you.
Hello (Narges).
I must thank you (Kazem).
Is this how you prove
your brotherhood?
(Narges), don't say this.
Did you save your men like this
when you were at the front?
(Narges), you said you want to
give his wife's message.
I swear you to (Abouzar)'s life,
for God's sake...
...what'll happen at the
end of this journey?
Does it have any end at all'?
God willing.
How can I believe you'?
There's an army waiting outside...
Have trust in God.
(Hajji) come, they'll shoot you.
I'll stay here.
I'll die, if I go back home.
I won't move from here.
This is no place for you.
Listen to me!
Then whose place is it'?
Huh?
I'm talking to (Hajji).
Isn't he pulling the strings here'?
(Narges)!
(Narges)!
I swear (Abas) can
leave whenever he wants.
I won't get upset at all.
It's my duty to defend
(Abas), that's all.
He's talking about duty!
Who's really doing his duty'?
They're saying the same thing.
Who's telling the truth (Hajji)?
I know at the end of the day
(Abas) is going to be the victim.
So you want to kill my (Abas).
(Narges)!
(Narges)I I swear, I'll never forgive
you, if you talk to him like this.
Stop calling my name!
I hope (Narges) dies, so that
all of you get relieved.
Don't I have a say in this'?
(Abas), I'm your wife.
You're my everything
but you don't know (Hajji).
It doesn't make any difference for me.
I only care about your life.
Do I have to spend the rest
of my life visiting you in the prison'?
Is this the trip you wanted?
(Narges)!
Sister.
No one will lay a finger on (Abas).
I've told everyone it's my fault.
(Abas) will be with you after his treatment.
I promise.
Didn't you have a message from his wife'?
So you lied to me, huh'?
I swear, I didn't lie.
Then what are you waiting for'?
Did (Fatima) send this'?
You have a cold. Huh'?
Here.
No, it's because of the wind.
(Fatima),
(Fatima), you sent me the
shortest message possible.
You gave strength to my heart.
(Fatima), (Fatima), (Fatima).
I wish I were home, so that
I can cry on your shoulders.
But what can I do'?
Over here a lot of eyes are on me.
I'm tired (Fatima).
I want to sleep.
The sound of the Azan
is like a lullaby for me.
It's time to write my will.
I swear to Shiite's path...
every person has his
own duties in this society.
I also had a duty.
I do not have any
complaints against those...
...who might shoot me in a few minutes.
They did their duty and I...
am asking all those who somehow
suffered in this incident, to forgive me.
I hope you understand the intentions of your
humble slave. I never intended to hurt anyone.
(Fatima)!
My beloved (Fatima)!
I wasn't around during the war.
The war ended.
The pressure of life was so much
that once again I didn't understand you.
We only have two common
memories, (Abouzar) and (Salman).
I know the time has
ended for people like me.
My sons should be like you.
Make them understand.
Tell them dad couldn't
have unseen (Abas).
If (Abas) gets orders from
an ideal beyond war regulations...
how can I forget him and leave
him to those, who have forgotten him'?
(Fatima)!
My dear (Fatima)!
I don't want this letter to end.
I wish...
...for years...
...for hours...
for days...
Shut up!
Give it to me!
It found it under my foot last night.
I didn't want it to get damaged.
Yes'?
Everyone's fine.
(Abas) is fine too.
Listen Mr. (Salahshour)!
Instead of these small talks, you
better adjust your watch with mine.
Four minutes, according to mine.
Can you see anywhere
with these dark glasses'?
Not all things are there to see.
I can see the truth.
Hello'?
No!
I can't hear anything anymore.
Except for the ticking of my watch.
Listen to me!
According to the watch of this
respectful man sitting next to me...
...3 minutes.
Let's go!
Where do you want to take me'?
To the kitchen for a friendly chat.
Why don't we chat here'?
We'll bother those who are asleep.
But I don't find it necessary.
Are you from the intelligence agency?
No sir.
Then what'?
Assume I'm a cultural man.
Really?!
Where were you headed to'?
Paris.
Job?
I don't think it's your
duty to interrogate me.
Right now I play the
role of a hostage for you.
I think that's more than enough.
He won't tell me his job.
He might tell you.
Boss.
Boss.
What's wrong'?
I have to tell you
something important.
Wait.
Yes'?
It's 2 minutes.
You better not call anymore.
Obviously you haven't
taken me seriously.
Okay, you asked for this.
(Hajji). what's going on'?
These times and phone calls.
You keep going back and forth.
Don't worry.
It'll be fine.
One minute left to 6.
So what'?
What does he want to do'?
Do you know what's going to happen'?
I can guess.
It's 6 now.
What's going on here'?
Is it you (Hajji)?
What's this time thing'?
No, I don't know.
No, he went to the kitchen with a guy.
What?!
No.
Oh my God!
He killed him.
(Hajji), what have you done'?
(Hajji), you promised.
You promised no one would get hurt.
Why did you do this'?
Calm down (Abas)!
Why should I'?
This happened because I calmed down.
Why are you shouting'?
I swear you're not our (Mash Kazem)!
Why are you making so much noise'?
Lower your voice!
I won't.
I want to shout.
According to my watch, you have 3
minutes before the second incident happens.
These are the consequences
of your actions.
I'm not joking with anyone.
I'll do as I said.
Will you tell me your job'?!
Wait!
You can't kill a cultural man!
I asked who you are.
I have been invited
to Paris for a festival.
This guy has fainted in
the middle of the kitchen.
I didn't want to come.
I had to.
(Abas)
I guess now you know
there's no turning back for me.
Listen to me.
I'll do the talking!
You have one more minute.
Good.
I'm ready.
I was even ready
before this last shot.
So the car will come
in front of the agency.
Mr. (Salahshour).
I think this will be
the last time we're talking.
Just for your information.
(Asghar) will stay here!
He'll stay until we arrive
in London safe and sound.
That's all!
Lie down!
(Ham).
(Ham).
(Hajji)!
Get going!
Where'?
Don't you know where
you're supposed to go'?
No sir!
They've told me to wait for their orders.
I said go!
I don't have the keys.
(Ahmad).
This game is over.
I ended it.
Maybe it's over for you...
but not for me!
(Ahmad)!
Take (Abas).
I want both of them!
This is a fax.
Where's the original'?
I swear to their lives...
I won't back down,
if you do what's on your mind.
(Hajji), we have to take the helicopter.
Trust me (Hajji).
Then I'll take (Abas).
Come!
Okay!
We'll be out of Iran in half an hour.
I think...
we'll land in London
Airport in 3 or 4 hours.
Listen (Hajji)!
Foreign reporters are
waiting at the London airport.
What do you want to tell them'?
Nothing!
Only the truth!
They'll distort your words.
They'll change it and broadcast
something that isn't to our benefit.
Trust me, what I say can't
be to our disadvantage.
I wish you hadn't put
yourself in trouble!
Don't worry.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm thirsty.
Okay, buddy.
I'll bring you water.
Don't you need anything'?
(Hajji), I put you in so much trouble.
One day I'll make you
compensate for this.
You were supposed to
travel during the holidays.
Well...
...we're travelling.
(Hajji), please put your
hand on my neck.
My throat burns.
I want you to put
this hand on my neck.
No.
My hand is bloody.
I know.
I want you to put this hand.
I want to tell you a joke.
(Asghar), prescribed it last night.
The dose is once every one hour.
Tell me!
Once during an operation, 5 soldiers
...aTehrani...
a northerner...
aTurk...
a southerner and a Lor...
...were supposed to take captives.
(Abas)
(Abas)
(Abas)
(Abas), water!
(Ham).
The New Year arrived right now.
Happy New Year!
If we haven't left Iran's soil yet...
...we better land.
No!
Happy New Year (Abas)!
