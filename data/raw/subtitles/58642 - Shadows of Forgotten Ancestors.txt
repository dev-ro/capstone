SHADOWS OF OUR FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS
Mykhaylo Kotsyubins'ky
A God-forsaken Carpathian region.
A land of Ukrainian Huzuls
Olexa. My darling!
Your torments are mine
Dear God. Preserve Ivanko,
my last child
Come here, Ivanko
Don't look he's insane
Is that Satan, father?
You won't find Satan in church
Satan is among men
See? He gives money to God...
...but fleeces the poor
Paupers! You should be
begging by the door!
Please stop! This is a holy place
Teach those Paupers a lesson!
They've insulted us
You needn't tell what to do
Don't, they're vicious
I've others that are better
Mama bought me fancy stockings
I'll wear them and be a young lady
I can play a pipe
-Why did you hit me?
-Your father fights, too
-Your father started it
-No, yours did
Petrik, my darling!
Why did you have to die?
Lord, place a pox upon the
Guteniuks and upon their cattle
Don't be afraid. What is your name?
Yours is Ivanko
-I'm lending the lambs
-I'm lending the cows
That which Himka stole our flour
He soon forgot his father,
but not Marichka
IVAN AND MARICHKA
I'll be amongst the rushes,
with my white sheep
And I shall sing my songs to you
By the hay-rick, the cuckoo cooes
Marichka cooes to her darling Ivan
The wind is blowing
...in the valley where Marichka
drives Ivan's sheep
My darling flowers, where
shall I drive you
Perhaps I can sow them on the hills
Ivan, what is that?
An invisible axe
I'm frightened
-See the goat?
-Where?
Where are you going?
Where is my goat?
Godmother, why so late?
Where have you come from?
I've come from the sycamores,
from your godfather, from the forest
Holy mother of God, save us
What is it, Marichka?
Will we marry?
If God wills it
My family hates your family
I'll tell my mother. You'll
come and live with us
Cheer up
Come here
No matter what they say, you'll be
mine. Did you hear me, Marichka?
We'll never marry
Don't say that
what's wrong, my love?
May the Guteniuks lose
all they have, as I have
They've destroyed our family,
Ivanko, and you...
My darling
I never dreamt you'd go
to be a hired hand
You're leaving me here all alone
Give me your blessing
Lord, protect my son, Ivan...
...and remember the souls of my
departed children. Mikhail, Daniil...
...Anna, Vasily, Mikola and Olexa
Our Father which art in heaven...
How did you sleep Marichka?
Very well
-Are you leaving?
-It is God's will
I'll be back in winter. Wait for me
Come, my darling, spend
a little hour with me
Across the river, the hay was ablaze
I'll gaze at the star
above the pasture
So will I
Come, my darling, if only for an hour
I'll go to the glen, and think
all the time how summer will pass
Are you Guteniuk's daughter?
How pretty you are
Have some berries
What's this, eh?
THE PASTURE
God willing...
...we'll drive the sheep back
in the autumn
Whose son are you?
Pyotr Paliichuk's
Give me a job, I'll work well
"Why don't you marry?"...
...the wind asked the mountain
And the mountain replied
"The green pasture won't have me"
Through eternity
...they gaze at each other
but cannot marry
The wind alone carries songs to them
I don't know
Time vanished in the boundless
universe. "Why don't you marry?"
What's the matter Miko?
Why did she drown herself?
Find Marichka, Onufrii
Thinking he had pined away, people
made up songs about their love
LONELINESS
Come to my wedding, Ivan
I will if I can
Don't put it out, Ivan.
It has to go out by itself
I know
Did you hear what happened to
Poliichuk? Did you see Ivanko?
He was so handsome. Now
he's wretched and tattered
His mother was such
a good housekeeper
He's all alone now. he's sold
all but one lamb
-What a fine lad he was
-look at him now
-How are you?
-Fine. And you?
I sold two pelts,
bought some pepper...
...and headed back home
I saw ivan at the cemetery
He was digging a grave.
Don't tell a soul
It's shameful, what love
has done to him
Spring's on the way
The sun is warm. The ice is melting
Where's Ivan? who will wash
his clothes for him?
Who will cook his meals?
Who will bring him back to us?
His house is empty
We'd all help him if he come back
See what love has done to him
My old hut collapsed
I hired ivan to build me a new one
He's been at it a month,
always brooding
He won't say what's bothering him
I brought him food, but
he wouldn't eat
-Where were you?
-Seeing the priest
-What for?
-So he would pray for my son
I saw ivan there
He was painting the roof,
or making a cross
He was dressed in rags,
in this freezing whether
They say everything's going
to freeze this winter
Good evening, my good sir!
Let's rejoice
O let the earth be happy,
for the son of God is born
Lay the table with fine white cloths,
let us rejoice
O let the earth be happy,
for the son of God is born
Put out wheaten loaves,
made of spring flour
-Where were you?
-Drinking with the boys
-Our boys, or Magyars?
-Magyars. We had a wild time
Did you see Ivan there?
I gave him some vodka. They got him
so drunk, he ran after the girls
They have saddled the white horses
The girl is ready for the wedding
O bride, bow down
Bitter times will greet you
At last ivan married, for he
had to set up a house
IVAN AND PALAGNA
If your mother was alive,
she would wash you better
Soon you'll have a wife
Dry him properly, for he's
going to Palagna
We'll dress him and he'll go for her
They'll be happy and
they'll visit us
I have but on daughter,
her name is Nastechka
When the beloved arrives,
you lads must come, too
He will be wearing red boots
made in Khotiv
He's comming!
WORKDAYS
CHRISTMAS
We've nothing to reap or sow,
nothing to feed our kid goat
The old woman went to the high hills,
but couldn't find its bones
She found only its horns.
Please remember our kid goat
Where's my child, Ivanko?
Where's my child, Palagna
Come, sorcerers and magicians...
...there's food and drink here
Vanish never to return
Christmas supper's ready
Lord...
...may lost souls join us...
...those hurt on long journeys...
...or drowned in deep waters
Drowned in deep waters
The holy virgin has borne a son
In a crib, with lambs amidst the hay
Where's my child, Palagna?
Where's my child?
Where are my goats?
She's come?
There's no one here. Go to sleep
Dull workdays, and sorcery
on holidays
THE EVE OF SPRING
Yearning for a child,
Palagna tried witchcraft
Lord, make Ivan want me
Make me happy. Grant me
healthy babies
A boy or a girl. I beg of you
Never seen a woman before?
Never one like you
Where have you been?
See what's happened!
Praised be Jesus Christ!
THE SORCERER
He was feared, but needed by all
Hearken to me, clouds and thunder
Go to the forests and waters
You have no power here. no power
Vanish in the forests and gorges,
away out of sight
Yura!
Are you all right?
I turned away the storm
Come to me. Soothe me
THE TAVERN
Praised be the Lord!
Across the river, the hay was ablaze
Come my darling, if only for an hour
I'll go to the glen, and think
all the time how summer will pass
Praised be Jesus!
IVAN'S DEATH
Look, Palagna
If I strike here, the arms wither
Here, the legs wither
-And here?
-The man dies
Let the horses go to water
Then we'll sell them, but
we won't tell the truth
People drink and mess about,
but let's praise God all the same
Ivan sing me any song you know
then I'll sing you a song
you will not understand
But tell me, Marichka...
...how have you twisted my brain,
like the twining of poplar and birch?
Will we marry?
Compassion
The deacon is hoarse.
Give him some vodka
Dear Ivan's dead
Woe is me!
Our ivan's dead
I've just remembered something
Ivan once said to me
"When I die, bury me in the white
clothes I wore in my youth"
I was suprised when he said that
