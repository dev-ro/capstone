Now, if you'll follow me
this way onto the quad,
we'll continue
our campus tour.
So, sweetie, remember,
if you drink a beer,
you drink a glass of water,
all right?
Six-pack of beer,
six-pack of water.
Okay. This just sounds
like way too much liquid.
Or just don't
party at all.
Okay, Mom, you're the one
who always talks about
how much you smoked
pot in college
and for a whole semester,
you just peed outside.
Okay,
they did call me,
"Smoke a Lot of Pot
and Pee Outside" Kate.
But I regret that.
Okay? Just skip over that
part and act like I am now.
Let's show her
stranger danger.
Do you know
stranger danger?
I'm sure...
Okay, this is real important.
So, I'm a scary frat guy.
Right?
Okay.
There's a lot of them.
Mom is you, all right?
Lucky me.
Okay.
Hey, sweet thing.
My name's Geppetto...
'Cause I make the ladies
my puppets.
See? I already
don't trust him.
Right? He's a bad guy.
Trust your instincts.
Weird choice.
So, you wanna
come up to the bro house?
You don't have
to answer.
But, for this scenario,
I will.
I'm fine, thank you. I'm
getting ready to study.
But I like
the silent type.
You smell good.
You probably think I'm close to
you, but I'd like to get closer.
Then you elbow him in the
balls, and then you roll away.
Right there.
And you roll.
And the guy's like,
"No! My nards."
And you get out of there.
So, stay away from guys
named Geppetto.
Got it. Thank you.
Guys...
I love this school. This is
where I wanna go next year.
We're so happy
you love it here!
Let us come with you!
She's just kidding.
Nah.
I love you guys.
We love you, too.
Come here.
God, our little baby!
If I get in.
If you get in.
If you get in.
Tough school.
It's tough.
God. No,
I don't wanna click it.
I'm not gonna click it. One
of you click it. I'm not...
Honey, Alex,
you're an A student, okay?
Chill. I'm sure you got in.
You know, if they don't want
my baby, they're stupid.
The Bisons? What kind
of mascot is that?
If they say no to you,
I say we say no to them.
Fuck the Bisons!
You know.
Yeah. Bucknell,
more like Fucknell!
Yes!
I got in!
You got in! Yes!
Bucknell, I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!
We're Bucknell!
Bucknell, baby! Bucknell!
Yeah! Bucknell!
It's a majestic creature,
the bison. Bisons! Bisons!
Man, Frank is not looking
so hot since Raina left.
I can smell
that poncho from here.
He looks like Animal
from the Muppets.
What's up, buddy?
How are ya?
Frank, buddy.
Great party!
Yeah, it's going
great?
Yeah, we're glad
you could come.
You made it.
Yeah, of course I made it.
Rode my bike all the way here.
Good.
Yeah.
What happened
to your car?
I can't find it.
You guys must be
pretty psyched, right?
Yeah, we are.
So proud of Alex.
She's really grown up.
No, no, no.
I'm talking about us.
I'm talking about the three
of us, next week. Vegas!
We were thinking
about Vegas.
Yeah.
What if we push Vegas
until the fall?
Yeah. We still go. We just
push it a little later.
No. There's only now.
There is no later, right?
We'll... We'll talk.
All right, buddy.
All right.
Guys, high school's over.
And, let's face it, we're
not ready for college.
It seems like being
a freshman in college
means you have to be prepared
to get date raped, right?
I don't understand the difference
between, like, rape and date rape.
I think date rape is when you go to
dinner and a movie, and then rape.
She's talking to her friends
about how sad she is.
Yeah.
Look at
their body language.
They don't want
to leave their parents.
We're gonna pack everything we should have
done at high school into this summer.
I mean, I kind of told my parents
I'd hang out with them this summer.
No, my parents are fun.
For parents, they're fun.
For people,
they're the worst. I...
Does your mom even
talk to you, Rachel?
Stop.
How did we get so lucky
to snag a kid like that?
I don't know.
Kind of feel like
I'm losing my best friend.
Gotten so used to it
being us three.
What's it gonna be like
when it's just us?
Well, it's gonna...
Come on!
I mean, yeah!
Empty nest?
This nest is gonna be
filled with our loving.
Yes!
Yeah!
It's gonna be a regular
fuck fest around here.
Yeah!
Get your passport ready,
'cause we're...
We'll be going
to fuck town.
What a nice party.
Hey, thank you so much
for the party.
You're welcome.
It was really fun.
I had such a good time.
Rachel invited me over
to her house tonight,
and I was wondering
if I could go.
Well, we were gonna
watch Walking Dead.
What's more fun,
hanging with your friends,
or watching zombies eat
people with your parents?
Think it's time
for an Alex sandwich?
Please stay, please stay.
Stay, stay, stay.
Okay. Okay, I'll stay.
Yes.
Brains.
Brains.
No! No!
Brains.
My God!
All right, town.
We'd now like to open up
the floor to its citizens.
First up on the docket,
Council would like to
recognize Officer Chandler.
Good afternoon.
Last Tuesday night at
approximately 3:14 a.m.,
vandals spray-painted what
appears to be a male penis
and accompanying genitalia
on the high school
football field.
It has since been removed.
All right.
Town would like to recognize
Frank Theodorakis.
$1,500 of fines
for the height
of my hedges.
This is bullshit, Bob.
Screw this town.
I am out of here.
Right after I say this.
Raina, baby,
please come home.
You're my wife.
God.
I love you, and I want
you to come home.
Frank, shut up. Stop it.
This is the only time I can
be in the same room with you.
Come home!
Just not here!
It's not going
the way you think it's going.
I want it, but I've gotta turn
this around. Raina, just...
Stop it. Go. Just...
Come on!
And where the hell
is our car, Frank?
Well, looks like
Fox Meadow's having
its own little
soap opera play out here.
I'm sorry.
No need
to apologize to us.
Just apologize to yourself
for making a bad decision.
On a bad man.
Moving on to
the next issue.
If we could, please.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fox Meadow's
most exciting project,
the town pool!
What?
The actual pool
will be five pools,
picnic area, playground,
state-of-the-art
locker room,
and the best food court
in the tri-state area.
All right, the last item
on today's agenda
is 207-G,
that is the Fox Meadow
Scholarship,
rewarding one hardworking
high school student...
This is us.
He's talking about us.
By paying
their college tuition.
This year's recipient is none
other than Alex Johansen.
Alex Johansen.
Alex... Yes!
Unfortunately,
the town is facing
some devastating
budget cuts this year
and I'm afraid the
scholarship is an indulgence
that the town
can no longer afford.
All right, so if that is it,
then we can move on.
Hold on, please.
Bob...
Are you saying that you don't
have money for the scholarship,
but you have money
for the town pools?
Look, I would love to give
Alex this scholarship.
Heck, I'd love to give
everybody a free education.
So, let's open it up
to the town.
By a show of hands,
who here likes swimming?
No, wait.
No, don't raise your hands.
Come on.
That's not what we're debating here.
It's a trick question.
I guess I'm a little torn
here, to be quite honest,
'cause I do love Alex.
But I also love swimming.
Shut up, Joe.
I love swimming.
I'm Martha.
'Cause, you know,
with three kids and a job,
it's the only
me time I get.
Of course
you want the pool, Martha.
It's right next
to your house.
You know what Laura
brings to a potluck?
Her nasty mouth
and no more.
How was I supposed to know that
I was supposed to bring food?
That invitation was vague.
And you don't have to keep telling
everyone your name's Martha, they know.
But that's who I am,
I'm Martha.
All right, ladies,
enough, enough.
Let's bring this to a vote.
Those in favor
of eliminating the scholarship
and building
the town pool, vote yes.
Those opposed, who want
one family to profit
while the rest
of the town suffers, no.
Yes?
All right, looks like
the yeses have it.
Please.
I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna take a hate crap in that pool.
We can barely afford
our mortgage, and now this?
It's time we face the truth,
we're bad parents.
Remember that mother who
threw her baby down a well?
We're worse
than that mother.
You know, when I became a dad,
I made a choice.
To be the dad my father wasn't.
Right?
To play with my daughter,
to support her dreams
and talents,
and, yeah, maybe I could have
spent a little more time
checking on
what was in the bank.
But instead, I put my
heart in the bank.
I deposited love,
a lot of it.
And that's not gonna be the cover
story of The Wall Street Journal,
but it's the headline
of my heart.
No, honey, I lost you
halfway through.
Okay, the bottom line is that Alex thinks
we can afford tuition, and we can't.
We need to tell her
the truth.
We always tell the truth.
That's what we always say.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think we should do it.
I'm not gonna do it.
Me neither.
We gotta lie about everything,
because that's what parents do.
The job of being a parent,
number one job,
is to keep this crazy shit
from their kids.
'Cause otherwise, the kids are gonna realize
that we don't know what we're doing!
Exactly, that's what
our parents did!
Yeah.
My dad had cancer
and never told us!
And what you didn't know,
didn't hurt you.
It was weird.
But I got over it.
And then he died, so...
Hey, guys.
Hi.
I heard about
the scholarship.
So, I guess
I can't go to Bucknell.
You're going
to Bucknell University.
We're gonna
send you there.
Yeah. Yeah.
And if we can't keep the
promise that we make to you,
we are the worst parents
in the world.
Honey.
Thank you guys so much.
I love you guys.
Love you, too.
So, as you know,
Bob took away our scholarship,
which we were
kind of counting on.
But then we remembered
that we have a college fund
with our dear
financial advisor, Dawn.
You don't have
enough money.
I don't have any money.
Can I have a raise?
No way. No earthly way.
I have an idea.
Can we apply for a loan?
Listen, I'm just gonna
come right out with it.
No one's gonna
lend you shit.
But if I don't
get my job back...
Are you jerking off a giant?
No, I'm...
I just hung...
I just hanged myself.
I don't know
if you heard me.
If you don't
give me a raise,
I'm walking out
of this building
and I'm not looking back.
I don't believe you, and
I think you're bluffing.
Is this the face of a man
who's bluffing?
Okay, right here.
It says right here, in this
account, we have $401,000.
You missed it!
No, that says
you have a 401K account.
Look, we have to tell him that
we're not going to Vegas, okay?
Yeah. There's no way we can go.
Yikes.
I'm not a loser.
You are a loser!
Frank? Where are you, bud?
I'm not a loser! No!
What do you
want from me?
What do you
want from me?
Sign the divorce
papers, Frank!
No, I don't wanna do...
What did I do to make
you hate me so much?
We should get out of here.
Give them their privacy.
You punched my dad!
He called m
a gambling addict!
You are a gambling addict.
You lost your job,
and you stopped showering.
We should go.
She's coming.
I know.
Just sign the fucking
divorce papers, Frank.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey, Raina, you look great.
That was crazy.
Yeah, it was kind of weird.
We don't really know.
Yeah.
He's your problem now.
Hey, Frank?
Hey, bud.
Hey. Hey, guys.
What's going on?
I was fixing the sink.
Splashed
some water on my face.
That's what's
going on here.
'Cause I was fixing the sink
'cause the sink was broken.
Right, it's okay.
We saw Raina.
I know my life seems totally awesome and,
like, things are going great, but...
It looks
pretty bleak in here.
Who am I kidding? I'm having a
pretty hard time right now.
It seems like it. Yeah.
Which is why I'm all in
on this Vegas trip.
That's the only thing that is keeping
me alive right now, frankly.
So, let's get
this party started!
Right.
You know...
We know you need it.
But, for us,
it's not a great time.
So, we were thinking,
maybe...
Maybe...
We could leave later than
we talked about leaving.
You said
we were going to say...
I said we have since...
decided that we need
to support a friend.
Who's this friend?
Vegas.
It's 11! Eleven!
Yes! Yes!
Gentleman needs some chips.
Guys, what are you
waiting for?
Get in on this! I'm hitting every
single number over and over again.
Let's do this!
Dice are out!
Eleven!
This dude is on fire!
You guys need money?
I am literally making every single
person at this table money.
I don't know, we said
we weren't gonna gamble.
Come on. What's the worst
that could happen?
Maybe we put
a few dollars on four.
Hot shooter.
I mean, yeah, the fourth
is Alex's birthday.
We'll just do one bet.
I kind of can't lose at this
point, so let's do this.
Welcome to the Wynn, sir.
Number four, please.
No, no, not all 500.
Hey!
Yeah! Fuck yeah, four!
Yes! Yes!
Four! Four!
I should tell you, the probability of
hitting four again, very unlikely.
But if we do, you guys are gonna double
that and it's gonna pay out big.
And, plus,
it's for baby Alex!
Alex! Alex! Alex!
Alex! Alex! Alex!
That's a four.
Come on, Frank!
Frank, look at me!
We're gonna do this, Frank!
Here we go, Kate!
Let's do this!
Four!
Okay, guys...
If I roll another four, that's
Alex going to college, all right?
I feel very lucky
right now.
We believe in you, Frank.
All right.
Whatever you do,
don't roll a seven!
Why would you say that?
I didn't know!
No!
No!
Fuck you, asshole!
No!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
God damn it!
Seven out,
there was no four.
Hey, that money's
my daughter's college tuition.
Yeah?
Well, she just got accepted
to the School of Hard Knocks.
Misroll! It's a misroll!
I said not a seven!
Give me that stick!
Give it to me!
"Whatever you do,
don't roll a seven"?
Thanks a lot, asshole.
You basically jinxed us all.
I was merely trying to make you
aware of what number not to roll,
which, by the way,
for the record, was seven.
Fuck you, asshole!
That guy gets it!
Why is that guy
following me?
Why?
Because he hates you.
I hate you, too, right now.
This place
makes you crazy.
You know, we came in hell-bent on
not gambling, and what did we do?
We gambled and
we lost all our money.
You know what I say?
House always wins.
What if we were the house?
Are you guys
familiar with the cliche,
"It's a cliche
because it's true"?
Well, that cliche about cliches
being true has never been more true
than right now
with the cliche,
"The house always wins."
What?
Okay?
Now, we stand to make
four years' tuition
in one month.
One month, guys.
Think about that.
This is the most impressive
thing you've ever done, Frank.
Thanks, Scott.
I'm very wary to go
into business with you.
Noted.
However, we know
why we need the money.
Yes.
What's in it for you?
Well, full disclosure, the bank
has foreclosed on my home.
There we go.
So, this money would
help me get that back.
That's pretty much
why Raina left me.
No, that's not
why Raina left you.
It's because you started
gambling on golf...
True. Well, not just golf,
but okay.
And you developed
an online porn addiction.
Okay, it's not an addiction if you can
quit any time you want, which I can.
I don't want to right now.
Listen, I know I'm throwing a lot of
numbers at you guys, lot of financials.
But let's not take away from the
fact that this is gonna be fun.
Okay, but we're not
doing it for fun, right?
No, we aren't. No.
I think we're saying
the same thing, all of us.
Work hard, play hard.
Everybody has fun.
I think this slide
will explain it.
Hey!
Well, it just says "fun."
But it just says "fun."
Yeah, it's gonna be a great time,
probably the best time of our lives.
And we're gonna make
crazy money.
The graphics are great, but it
doesn't help us. It doesn't.
I have one last slide to show you,
and I think it's the most important.
Check this out.
Look at Alex, right?
Here she is.
She's gone to college,
Bucknell,
top of her class,
built her own company.
If she doesn't go to college, boom!
She's a homeless prostitute.
She's a runaway
on the streets,
selling her tiny body
for money.
I don't like this. This is
very emotionally manipulative.
Yeah, exactly.
May I speak
with you privately, please?
Right now?
Yes, I'd love to talk to you
in the kitchen, if I could.
Okay.
Well?
Thumbs up, right?
I mean, the math.
It seems to check out.
Do this math.
You're 40 years old and you
go to jail for 20 years.
How old are you
when you get out?
Ninety. Hundred.
No. Honey...
If I have some scratch paper,
I can figure it out.
Really fucking old!
Besides, I don't wanna start
an illegal operation with...
Frank?
Yes!
No, he's your best friend.
He's my long friend. We haven't
been friends since college.
Besides,
we promised Alex
that we would spend time with
her before she went to college.
But if we don't have the money,
she can't go to college.
And then she's living
with us until she's 40,
working as a banged-up
cocktail waitress.
She's gonna have tattoos with
weird guys' names on them.
She's gonna get
a neck tattoo.
My God.
Of a hand trying
to choke her.
I know. You don't
think I know that?
We need to figure
this shit out!
Can we pull this off?
I mean, can we run a casino?
It's a shady business
with criminals, mobsters, you
know, with shady people.
Look, we tried
to play it safe,
we've tried to play by the
rules, and it got us nowhere.
What do we have to lose?
Nothing.
So, what do you guys think?
Let's take a risk for Alex.
All right, fuck it, I'm in.
Yes!
Yeah!
We'll do it here, my house.
My hedges are crazy high,
so it's private.
Plus, Raina took
a lot of the furniture,
so we've got
plenty of room for tables.
We need players.
That's easy.
There's Martha. Her husband
left her last year,
and now she runs book club
and tries to suppress the rage
bubbling just beneath the surface.
There's Joe, retired at 30,
taking care of his mom
and bored
out of his fucking mind.
Then there's Reggie,
who just made partner
at his law firm,
which means he's got cash to burn,
but he's super stressed out.
He needs to blow off steam.
Now, remember, this is
an underground casino.
We can't park
outside my house,
or everyone will know,
including the cops.
Park at Taylor's,
buy something and keep the receipt
to prove you're a customer.
Don't attract attention.
Remember, you're just
buying groceries.
You're not on your way
to an illegal casino.
Walk out to the back,
where the electrical wall
and the wooden fence
meet by the woods.
Ignore the sign.
It's a decoy.
Got it.
Take the path
through the woods,
bear left
at the fourth tree,
and boom,
you're right in my backyard.
Go down the basement stairs,
then knock three times
and give the password.
Andre the Giant.
Welcome.
Frank!
When we open this door,
don't get confused.
It's still just
Frank's house.
Ta-da!
What do you guys think?
I mean, am I in the
Bellagio right now,
or am I three blocks from my house?
I genuinely don't know.
This is the best day
of my entire life.
Thumbs up. Pretty good.
And we can gamble here
for real money?
This isn't like one of those charity
things where you think you're winning,
but then you have to give it to
cancer research or some bullshit?
You win it, you keep it.
Okay, you know what,
fuck book club!
Fuck book club!
On these notes,
let the games
of chance begin!
Yeah!
All right, man.
Hit me right now!
Hit it!
Hit it down right there!
And I lost!
All right!
Mama like!
Now, we don't have
five years to make the money.
We only have a month.
So, we have
to reinvest our winnings.
It's like I always say, "Back your
own horse, baby. Bet on yourself."
We gotta invite everybody,
even Garvey and fucking Craig!
Did I win? That's fun.
I never played before.
Isn't that funny?
Anybody been to that Burrito
Hut over on Fox Meadow Lane?
Yeah, it's a nightmare.
You can't even get a
burrito out of there.
People are getting
so involved,
they had to put
a spit guard up,
because people kept falling
into the vegetables.
"More corn!
I want more corn!"
So, where are we at?
All right.
When all's
said and done,
we are...
Down $3,500.
Yeah!
Nice!
Wait.
Up top!
Down?
Wait...
Listen, Reggie went on a streak,
that comedian was very expensive.
We're lucky that Joe lost
that $1,000 bet at the end.
If he hadn't, you know
where we'd be then.
Where would we be?
Really?
We'd be down $5,500.
It's simple math.
Math gives him anxiety,
numbers make him nervous.
A lot of people, you know,
break out in sweats
and have heart palpitations when
they hear numbers out loud.
That's not true at all.
But, you know what,
let's not worry about that.
Let's just focus
on the positives,
which is, down $3,500
is a great start.
Bucknell.
What's this?
50 million dollars?
Thousand, honey.
God.
My butt just got
so tight.
Yeah.
Hey, what's that?
Hey.
What?
Nothing.
Hey.
We gotta get
a bell on you.
Sneaking up
on us like that.
Yeah.
And so that's why your mother
and I will be working late,
every night,
and on weekends
for all of next month.
Because you're working on a
super top secret project
that you may or may not
reveal to me later.
Yes, exactly, you get it.
No, but I don't get it.
You're just being weird.
You're acting weird,
with your shifty eyes
and your sketchy posture.
Sorry.
Doesn't feel good to be called
names, does it? Weirdo.
I thought we'd hang out
a lot this summer.
Are we still
going school shopping?
Yes! Absolutely, we're gonna
do all of those things.
While you work every night
until 3:00 a.m.?
You know what?
-You're kind of acting like a...
-Bitch.
What did you just say?
I didn't say it.
I didn't vocalize it.
Mom?
If it walks like a duck and talks
like a duck, it's probably a...
Bitch.
You just said "bitch."
You just called me a bitch.
Don't say that word.
I just can't help but feel
like you're lying.
My God!
This is what I wanted to show you guys.
Pretty beautiful, right?
It's Thomas Kinkade,
Master of Light.
It's mesmerizing.
Yeah.
But it's,
so much more.
Crafty hiding spot, Frank.
Each of these safes
holds 100 grand.
I know, because I cut paper into
money-size stacks and I checked.
It took an incredibly
long time.
Now, if we fill all five
safes, that's 500 grand.
250 for you,
250 for me.
You guys can put
Alex through college,
and I can get my life
back on track.
Let's fill these
fucking safes.
Looks like we got some
heavy action tonight.
Yeah, Reggie winning was the best
thing that could have happened to us.
People actually think they
can win money at this place.
We're giving people hope.
There's at least one, two,
three, four...
There's at least 800 people
in here tonight.
There are max
35 people in this room.
You got a 19!
Yeah, I'll take advice from the
guy who's down four grand.
Is that what
I'm supposed to do?
Please, will you leave,
so we can all win?
We could all win
if you leave.
Fellas, come on. What's the beef?
How can we squash it?
This bo-bo here keeps
hitting on the worst hands.
I play how I play. You
don't like it, you leave.
And he's a thief.
Where's my leaf blower,
Garvey?
I just thought maybe you'd
wanna rake a little bit more.
You know, get some physical activity,
on account of you being fat.
Hey, hey! Okay! Time out!
Gentlemen, time out!
Time out!
You're 86'd.
Come on!
Right in my armpit!
It's such a sensitive area.
I'll squash
the shit out of you!
They'll be peeling you off the
ground, you sackless bitch.
I'll bet
100 bucks on Reggie.
He's gonna kick
Garvey's ass!
I will call that bet, sir.
There is fear in Reggie's eyes.
I know a pussy when I see one.
Only when you're
looking down.
Reggie, we got this.
Eat shit, Garvey.
That's right.
Laura, you wanna
keep your mouth shut?
You got a big
fucking mouth.
There's a StairMaster
downstairs.
Why don't you go stand
next to it and do nothing?
You want a piece of these thighs?
You don't know what's coming.
Everybody,
shut the fuck up!
Nobody is betting
on this fight.
Thank you, Frank.
What?
Come on.
Yes.
Unless you're betting
with us!
Damn skippy. Damn skippy.
That's right, I'm gonna...
We're gonna bet
on our friends fighting?
Hell, yeah! Are you kidding?
We're a casino.
Have you ever heard of Fight Night?
This is the same thing.
Get your juices in there.
Come on, Scott, these guys are gonna
beat the shit out of each other anyway.
These dildos
are gonna bet on it.
We should be getting
that action. We're the house!
Hey! Who wants a fight?
Can't wait!
Can't wait!
Who wants fight?
Say, "Hey!"
Hey!
Here we go, fight!
Here we go!
And we're gonna
start a race war!
Reggie, Reggie,
that makes us nervous.
This is just a fight between
two men of different races,
fighting each other to decide
which race is superior.
Nope, that sounds wrong.
Black power!
Welcome to Fight Night!
In the corner
closest to the fireplace,
weighing in
at 220 pounds,
Reggie "The Rocket" Whaler.
And in this corner,
weighing in at 180 pounds,
give it up for Kevin
"I Didn't Know His First Name
Was Kevin" Garvey!
Now, murder each other!
That was fast.
Reggie is the winner!
This is bullshit.
I want my money back.
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.
Laura, why don't you shove that
chicken dinner right up your asshole?
And then bring it
to my potluck.
For the love of God, if you
bring up that potluck again...
Ladies!
Cool your jets!
Yeah.
Save it for the ring!
What's my name?
I'm Martha!
Yes, come on. Fight!
Yeah!
Fuck you, Craig!
I don't know why
I love this so much!
Eat her fucking face off,
Martha!
She doored her!
Double knockout?
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.
What does that mean?
Okay, the good news is we don't
have a prop bet to cover that,
so the house
wins everything!
I'm feeling
pretty good.
Yeah, me, too.
Can I talk to you in the
laundry room for a second?
This is why I'm not worried
about next year.
No. Not in the least.
Is this a real microscope?
Yeah, dude. You can get high and
look at ants at the same time.
We never walk at night.
So nice to walk.
So beautiful.
I drive everywhere. It's
just nice to get out...
Excuse me, beep-beep.
Beep-beep.
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm gonna pee outside.
What?
I'm gonna take
a pee outside.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna do it.
What, are you kidding?
Come on.
She's doing it.
Yes! Yes!
You're so good at it.
This is the real me!
Yes.
Yes!
"Pee Outside" Kate
is back!
You do it.
You're doing it.
This is my lawn.
You're a woman.
This is my lawn.
God, you got
a lot of pee-pee.
Shit!
What?
Fuck, it's my parents!
God damn it! Quick!
Is she still looking?
Guys, I'm feeling, like,
really nervous right now.
You want some weed?
We can totally go talk to her
like regular people.
How drunk are you?
I'm fine.
How many fingers
do I have up?
Don't do that.
Who's the president?
The president?
Bah...
Ba-Obama.
The back, the back, they never
come in through the back.
We'll just
sneak through there.
We'll go around the back.
Yeah. No, we never
go through the back.
Let's do it.
Go.
Go.
What are you doing?
Sorry. I'm so high.
The coast is clear.
Do you hear something?
What is it? Raccoons?
It sounds human.
Go.
Okay.
It's good. Rachel...
It's Rachel.
And Alex. Hey!
Hey!
Alex.
Hey!
Hey!
What's up, guys?
I got them.
Sorry. Sorry, Rachel.
Alex sandwich.
Alex sandwich.
God.
Sweetie.
You guys have
fun tonight?
Great hug.
Okay, this went great.
We're fine.
Night-night.
I'm gonna go pee.
And I'm good.
God.
God.
Good thing
it's a container store.
There's containers
everywhere.
Honey?
Yeah. I'm just gonna lie down.
Check some emails.
Fuck.
Excuse me one second.
Raina?
You're the Raina
of Raina's Hair Salon?
Okay, what are you doing here?
You got the divorce papers?
Listen,
I'm onto something big.
God.
Okay?
No, and it's not some
harebrained scheme
that I cooked up
with my friends.
I'm gonna get
the house back...
Cool.
And we're not gonna need
to get divorced.
It's not gonna need to even happen.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Are you gambling again?
What?
Is that what this is?
No, no.
You gambling again?
No. And in fact...
I'm not gambling.
Why'd you say it
like that?
What do you mean?
No. Sorry, I'm just saying,
in terms of gambling...
Yeah.
People might be doing it,
but I'm not.
You just did it again.
What? I'm not gambling.
"I'm not gambling"?
Yeah, that's right.
All right, I'm not gonna argue with you.
You look nice.
Thanks.
Well, you smell good.
I mean, you look good.
What? Okay. No, yeah.
I mean, you're nice.
I'm not doing this.
Just because you've showered
and you look great,
it doesn't mean
you've changed.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
You might notice that I've made
some Vegas-style upgrades.
Welcome to Club Ooze.
Because what does every casino
need, but a kick-ass pool.
You're done gambling, what are
you gonna do? Go home? No.
You're gonna come out here,
get a drink, party in the pool
and then back inside
to lose more money.
How much did
all of this cost?
You know that old saying,
"Spend money to make money."
Now, this
I'm very excited about.
These are pure
oxygen tanks.
I'm pumping it into the
house, and guess what...
It works.
Welcome to the
relaxation zone.
We've got a nail salon, we've
got massages, shiatsu,
deep tissue and hand jobs.
Bob... I think
we really need to start.
I'll start
when everyone's here.
Stop it.
What?
Where is everyone, Laura?
Nowhere. Why do you think
they're somewhere?
Why are you wearing
sunglasses in town hall?
'Cause...
my future's so bright.
Well, I find it
highly disrespectful.
Would you please
remove the sunglasses?
Fine.
My God.
What happened?
This looks
way worse than it is.
What are you
hiding, Laura?
What's that face?
You wanna fight me, Bob?
What?
Is that what
this is about, Bob?
'Cause I'll tell you
right now,
I'll headbutt you
to next Tuesday, bitch!
Well...
Okay.
This town hall meeting
is suspended
until I find out what's going
on around town, all right?
I can't believe no one showed
up at the goddamn meeting.
And I was going to announce that Panera
was opening a location on Butler Ave.
Panera Bread?
Great get, Bob.
My God, you do
so much for this town.
It's a 24/7 job.
But I love it.
Plus, means I get to spend
more time with you.
Stop.
What?
Stop it.
Were you guys
holding hands?
Yeah. We were holding hands,
Chandler, you know why?
'Cause we're
having an affair.
Yeah.
Nine and a half months,
emotional and physical.
Yep. He knows about all
my hopes and dreams.
Yeah, yeah, I plead with her
to leave her husband,
but in reality, I would be
sort of scared if she did.
That's so specific.
It just sounds
like it's true.
No, there's nothing
going on with us, Chandler.
But there is something
going on in this town.
I've been noticing a lot of crazy
shit going on in this town.
Over at Taylor's Meat Market at night,
the parking lot is really crowded.
Maybe there's
some flank steaks
that are starting
a gang over there.
Looks like a pork chop
prostitution ring.
Now leave,
so we can have sex.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll get the blinds.
But make it quick.
How are we
looking tonight?
Garvey caught
a heater in blackjack,
but we're killing it
in roulette.
Good call hiring that Judy, by
the way, she destroys people.
She's a bad-ass bitch.
Hi, Judy.
You're very smart
with this stuff.
Very shrewd.
Where'd you get that?
This?
Joe gave it to me. Some sticky-icky
hybrid. It chills me the fuck out.
You want some?
No. No, I'm good.
Maybe later.
I gotta stay vigilant.
Keep my eye on the prize.
Yeah. Weed is so great,
you know?
When I smoke it,
I feel nothing.
It's like
emotional armor, man.
Alex is gone next year,
who cares?
I got weed.
And you, yes.
Guys, we've got a problem.
Table four,
third guy from the left.
This motherfucker right
here is counting cards.
How do you know? If I'm gonna accuse
someone of cheating, I wanna be sure.
He's cheating.
Yeah.
He's definitely cheating.
That's so rude.
If people think you can
come in here and cheat,
the street is gonna
think we're soft.
Yeah. Every Blackjack Barry and Roulette
Rob's gonna think it's open season.
We gotta do something
to send a message.
Like De Niro in Casino.
Didn't he break that guy's
hand with a hammer?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right. Okay.
Yeah.
Kazowee!
Excuse me, can we have
a word with you, please?
Yeah, I'd love another Grey
Goose on the rocks, extra lime.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Enjoy your gambling.
Get in here.
All right, okay.
Watch the jacket.
Sit down!
Sit down!
You think you can
cheat us?
You think you can
steal our money?
I got lucky. I didn't know it was
illegal to catch a hot streak.
Well, your luck
just ran out, man,
because me and my friends
about to fuck you up!
Yeah!
Hey, pal.
You better call your momma and tell
her you're gonna be late for dinner.
Which is a shame, 'cause she's serving
your favorite, coconut shrimps!
Hey, you're gonna
miss dinner, bitch!
We had your mom's
shrimp last night.
It was delicious!
What are you guys gonna do about it
anyway? You're a bunch of soccer moms.
You ever hear of Tommy Papouli?
He's my boss.
You know what? Fuck this guy.
And fuck Tommy whoever.
I'd like to introduce you
to my friend, Mr. Vice.
How does that feel?
Yeah, I got it.
Coat's coming off, bitch!
Coming off!
You taking your jacket back
to Marshalls?
I'm gonna get me
a chunk of flesh.
Yeah! Yeah, maybe we'll cut
your fucking dick off.
Shit!
Shit!
This shit just
got real, bro!
I'm so scared.
You're looking
at a bad man.
This motherfucker
don't give a shit.
Yep.
This axe is burning
a hole in my pocket.
What are we doing?
Can we just conference
on what we're doing?
We're gonna...
Just you wait.
Hold on.
We need to focus up and figure
out what we're gonna do.
Honey, are you
still stoned?
What?
Yes!
I am also stoned
and nothing is more clear
than the fact that we
need to murder this guy.
Just to be clear,
we're pretending, though,
we're not gonna
actually do that.
We have to send a message, okay?
We have to send a message.
Yeah!
You're bluffing.
You're not gonna do shit.
You're not gonna do
jack shit, Paul Bunyan.
He's making it easy.
You know what?
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna do this.
Hey, hey, hey, hold on.
Fuck off!
You're not gonna do shit.
No, I'm gonna use...
Tommy's gonna
kick your fucking ass.
Fuck you!
Don't wrestle
with the fucking axe!
Fuck you all!
Shut the fuck up, Frank!
Put it back on!
Put it back on!
I'm trying to find it!
I'm trying to find it!
My God. My God.
Shut up!
Apply pressure, man.
Please, apply pressure.
I'm trying!
It's so slippery!
It won't fit on!
It won't fit back on!
Honey, please get it on.
I don't know if it's up or down.
Does anyone have any gum?
I'm just gonna put it right
there, maybe it'll grow back.
My God, the blood!
Could this help?
Put that Croc on there.
So salty! I'm swallowing
so much blood!
You cut off
my fucking finger!
What the fuck
just happened?
Tell your friends,
if they mess with us,
this is what...
They're gonna get.
Nothing ever happens
in this neighborhood.
Sweetheart!
Where are you going?
Where are you going
Don't go in there, buddy!
No, I swear to God, I'm looking, Reggie.
I'm not finding it.
In my experience, money lost in the
woods does not easily get found.
Fuck.
Buddy, great news.
Excuse me, sir?
What are you doing out here?
Jogging.
You don't appear
to be jogging.
Well, now you're jogging.
You caught me
in a cooldown.
What'd you put
in your pocket?
Very slowly. Very slowly
with the hand, sir.
Very slowly, take it
out of your pocket.
Okay, Officer.
I think, earlier, you just saw
me put this phone in my pocket,
which is now
videotaping you.
I don't feel safe,
I don't feel safe.
I am Frank Theodorakis.
I don't feel safe in the woods,
the police are harassing me.
Hello, everyone,
I'm Officer Chandler,
and I'm here protecting
as well as serving.
What are you,
like, doing a PSA?
Well, if you're
filming this.
Look at you, you put your hands
on your hips immediately.
You look ridiculous.
I will end you!
I will end your life!
Man!
I'm sorry that I said that,
everyone,
and I...
am gonna...
What's that? I'm gonna
respond to this call.
What call? Nothing happened.
It didn't say anything.
There's a disturbance
in the force.
There's a disturbance
in the police force.
Dad.
What...
Dad, it's just...
It's just, it's good... Dad!
Don't touch 'em!
Hey, did you see the game?
Stay away
from the meat section!
Hey, there you are.
Everybody's looking for you
downstairs. What's going on?
Hey.
Hey.
So many buttholes,
so little time?
Yeah.
You okay, man?
You seem a little off today.
I don't know.
Something's changed, Frank.
I chopped a man's finger off.
And ever since that moment,
I've just been barraged
with a series of
anxiety-induced
hallucinations.
They're hallucinations.
They're not real.
You know what is real?
This is real.
This is real.
This is real.
And this is real.
And do you know where
all that money came from?
From you.
You chopped
that guy's finger off,
and the whole town
became afraid.
You know what they're
calling you on the street?
The Butcher.
They're so afraid of us,
people are starting to give
us the money they owe us.
I didn't know
people owed us money.
I've been extending
lines of credit
to all of our high rollers.
All the casinos do it.
It's not a big deal.
Frank, you didn't
tell me that.
And that's a huge decision.
You need to let Kate and I
be a part of that.
It's a moot point now,
okay? It's done.
Everybody's afraid that
you're gonna take them
into the garage
and chop some piece
of their body off. All right?
"The Butcher" is our identity.
Come on in.
Hey.
Do you guys mind if I...
Come on in, Reggie.
Okay.
Hi, Frank. Scott.
Here's that...
Here's that money I owe you.
I'm sorry it's so late.
Reggie, don't worry about it.
It's fine.
Hey.
You sure about that, Butcher?
You happy about that?
I mean,
don't let it happen again.
Yeah, you bitch!
You little bitch!
Hey, Butch, you want me
to go get your axe?
Yeah, so I can cut me off
a piece of bitch meat.
No, I don't want the axe.
Hey, Frank, this feels
a little light to me.
Reggie, is everything
you owe us in there?
I counted it myself.
Maybe I should count it.
Are you gonna count it?
I don't think...
Are you okay?
I'll handle the counting.
Okay.
Get out of here, Reggie!
Okay.
Tell your friends
what you saw here, Reggie.
Sorry.
That was amazing!
Did you see how scared he got?
Yeah! How did that feel?
It felt good.
Yeah.
Yeah, it felt real good.
Hello, Gary.
I understand you have
an overdue library book.
No! No!
Come here. Come here.
Pay your debts!
Get out of the way!
Hi, Crystal!
Where's our money?
Give it to us!
You piece of shit!
Give us the money!
No, no, no.
I'm tired of
asking you, Eddie!
Eat it!
Give us the money, Eddie!
You don't wanna
do this, Eddie!
Get out of here!
Just walk away, Angela!
I'm the Butcher.
And I'm the Burner.
Why are you guys talking
like that? Really low?
'Cause we're cool now.
Get on board.
Okay. This is what
we're doing from now on.
It's weird
when you do it.
You sound
like Cookie Monster.
Well, Cookie Monster
wants some
motherfuckin' lobster.
Madam Treasurer, there's
something for you to sign.
It's really nice.
I can't accept that.
How would I explain that
to my husband?
You can tell your husband
that you're in love with me
and that we're
gonna be together.
This is getting
out of control, okay?
Yeah, it is.
At first, it was, like, you know,
gifts and trips and things,
but I didn't know where
the money was coming from.
It was coming from me.
Yeah, but you took it
from the town.
And that poor girl's
scholarship?
Come on. Look at these
budget numbers, okay?
We are 300 grand short.
We're gonna get audited,
and we're gonna lose our jobs.
We're probably gonna
go to jail, okay?
Just stop.
At first it... Stop.
It was like...
Stop, stop.
Stop. Stop it.
I think, next year,
when Alex is gone,
we do this
every Tuesday night.
Yay! Cheers, team.
Hooray!
We look great.
We do.
We should dress like this
every night.
Yeah.
It's been a pretty tough
year for me.
And I just wanna say
thank you to both of you.
This might be
the best night of my...
What?
What?
Raina?
Hey. Easy, tiger.
It's okay.
We knew this day
would come. Okay?
Scott, Kate, excuse me.
I'm gonna go get my wife back.
Hold on, buddy. Frank.
Frank?
Hey, pal.
There's no reservations...
He's very strong!
Frank!
At least
I have my dignity.
I don't understand why
you're talking to me.
Go arrest that guy.
He attacked me.
Mr. Theodorakis,
I talked to him.
He said that you attacked him,
and then you grabbed
his man bun.
What? I don't remember
any of that.
Officer Chandler,
what's going on here?
It's been
a hell of a night.
I've gotten
multiple reports
of violence all over town,
and no one's talking.
Well, no one's
talking 'cause
there's nothing
to talk about, so...
What's your deal, Johansen?
No deal.
You got a deal, Bob?
No deal here.
Yeah.
I would advise you to put that away.
I'm a police officer.
Don't worry about it.
Check your
marshmallows, fellas.
No one says
"check your marshmallows."
You wanna get fucked
by a fire dick?
No.
Then check your marshmallows.
Yeah.
There's something fishy
going on with those three.
Definitely.
Are those women's sunglasses?
No. They're Italian.
And that's a woman's
cigarette. That's nice.
Also Italian.
Italian sunglasses,
Italian cigarettes.
Okay. Ciao.
Excuse me,
what the hell is that?
Craig ordered eggs,
over-medium.
No. Look at the yolks.
Those are hard, that's not
over-medium. Take it back.
Scott, I'm really
slammed right now.
I don't give a shit, asshole.
Take it back.
All right, dick face?
You're doing a great job.
Hey, sexy.
Hey, baby. Looking good.
Feeling better.
Hey, things are getting
super weird.
I just found
a glory hole upstairs.
Just a dick-sized hole
in the middle of the wall
that somebody made.
You know how I knew?
There was a dick
hanging out of it.
Who the hell are they?
They're
Wall Street guys.
They're betting
a lot of money.
They're also doing
a ton of blow.
Yes!
This is Frank
Theodorakis' house.
And right through those woods,
only 100 yards away,
is the parking lot
to Taylor's Meat Market.
Right,
the great meat conspiracy.
Come on, man.
Don't do blow on the table.
It gets in the felt.
Hey, we're betting
1,000 bucks a roll.
I'll do cocaine
off of whatever I want.
I'll do it off of that dumb
wall sconce over there.
Check this out.
What the shit?
Everybody, freeze! Police!
Everybody, freeze!
Respect my authority!
No, no! No!
No, freeze!
You're not freezing!
Freeze! Get on the ground.
You will stop or get arrested.
Do not inhale that!
My eyes!
Playing cards?
For cash?
That's illegal.
It's for charity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Which charity?
Horse circumcision.
Money for psychic kids.
Canada.
Where's the money?
This is pointless. You're not
gonna find anything anywhere.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, we've looked in
all of the other rooms, so...
Chandler, take a look.
Hey, Scotty!
Eyes up here, buddy.
Honey, don't point at that.
Look how nervou
the baby deer is.
You guys seem
pretty interested
in this painting, here.
We're not.
The baby. The doe.
What's this?
It's safes, Bob.
You fucking idiot.
Those are my
pornography collection.
Why don't we just
pop the safes and see
if it's all the money
that you've taken?
You can't open them
without the combo,
and I'm not giving it to you.
What are you looking at?
Why are you staring
at this photo over here, now?
Don't do that.!
A Post-it note.
Is this the combination?
'Cause you 69 yourself, 24/7?
Okay, here's the deal.
We're not gonna arrest you.
But you guys have to
shut down this casino.
What?
And also, we're confiscating
all your money.
Hold on, you can't take the
money. It's for our daughter.
You're gonna take
their money, Bob?
I'm not gonna
take their money.
I'm gonna confiscate
their money for the town.
Come on, Chandler,
you're not gonna get
caught up in this, are you?
You're a good guy.
Who's always lead baritone
when we go Christmas caroling?
Come on.
Shut up.
You remember when you guys
started an illegal casino?
I'm Alex.
I wanna go to Bucknell.
But my parents fucked up.
They couldn't find the money,
so they started
an illegal casino.
Bob, she's a kid.
We're taking the cash.
Let's go, Chandler.
Shut it down.
Bob. Bob!
That money's for college.
Tonight
at 11:00. Earlier this week,
a local man was treated
at Sacred Heart Hospital
for a severed middle finger.
Authorities believe
this may be related
to the recent
local crime spree.
The man is known to have
connections to Tommy Papouli,
long suspected
of racketeering,
illegal gambling,
and even murder.
Hey, sweetie.
You were watching Walking
Dead without us?
Yeah. Lizzie killed Mika.
Fuck, we suck.
We lost all our money.
And I am mentally
and physically
addicted to marijuana.
Honey, you love it.
I think about it all the time.
It's really hard
to focus right now.
I'm so mad I'm not high.
And we started a fight club.
What are we doing?
We're each other's enabler.
We're not even...
One of us has to be
an adult here.
So you do it.
You be it.
Okay. I'll be the adult.
And, as the adult,
I'm gonna say,
we're gonna call Frank
and tell him to shut it down.
Okay.
And that's how
we're gonna handle it.
Okay.
What a relief.
Right?
Or we keep it open,
and go big.
Or we do. Yeah.
Fuck Bob Schaeffer.
I'm not gonna look
my daughter in the eye
and tell her
she can't go to college,
because some small-time
city councilman
is bullying us.
Exactly! We'll call everyone
and tell them
the casino is still open.
No limit
on any bet in the house.
We go big,
we make our money,
and then we parachute
out of there.
Go big, or go home.
Let's do this!
Okay.
All right, here we go
Here we go!
All right!
This is fun!
That guy!
Fuck Bob Schaeffer!
We got a professional
shooter here.
He can't tell us
to shut down!
Let's go! Two more
Let's go. Come on.
Hey, Raina.
What a pleasant surprise.
My God!
You said, "I'm not gambling."
Raina, I meant that.
I'm not!
They are!
All of them,
and they're losing.
You know, when you emphasize
one word
more than the other,
you know
that's bullshit, right?
Okay, so do you want me to
emphasize something for you?
I am not coming back.
Oof.
They said go through Taylor's,
then through the woods,
then we'll get to the casino!
Let's do it!
I'm beginning to think Raina's
not gonna take me back.
Mom? Dad? What are you
guys doing here?
Alex, what are you
doing here?
We got invited
to this casino.
You shouldn't be here.
Come with us.
Sweetheart,
it's very complicated,
but we need to tell you
a few things.
Hello?
Hey, go around back.
There's a secret entrance.
The password is
Andre the...
Holy fuck,
look at this place.
When you said casino,
I didn't think
you meant fucking casino.
Remember me, motherfucker?
That looks great.
Hey, dickfuck,
you're not gonna like Tommy.
He doesn't cut off fingers,
he cuts off heads.
Shut up.
Come on.
Guys, we've got a problem.
He's got a gun.
Okay.
Where's the money?
We just got robbed.
Yeah.
Look, the safes
are all empty.
Do you know
how many times
I've seen someone point
to an empty safe
and say,
"We have no money"?
A hundred?
Five hundred?
It's rhetorical, fuckstick.
Okay.
Shut up.
This your daughter?
Where?
Who? Her?
Right here.
That's such a compliment.
This is my wife.
Alex?
In fact,
there's our daughter.
There she is. Hello, daughter.
Hi, honey.
Don't overthink it.
Just be our daughter.
Come right here.
I'm not your daughter.
That's your...
Sorry, Rachel!
Fuck's the matter with you?
What?
Shoving a girl like that?
We are strict disciplinarians
in our household.
Get out of my way.
I know this is your daughter.
Mom!
No, no, no!
Cuff her.
Sweetie.
Mom.
Honey.
Wait, no.
Take me, not her.
No. No one cares
if you die.
Thank God.
Help 'em find the money.
And hey...
300 grand. Or you'll never
see your daughter again.
Mom! Dad! Help! Help!
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Let go of me.
You know what? You got us.
There's $300,000 in money
in this room,
hidden in these money,
buckets.
So, if you want,
you can take the money
and we'll take
their daughter back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's one here,
there's one behind the bed
and there's one
right over there.
Money cannon.
Yeah!
Don't worry, guys, I got this.
Yes!
No! Not in Frank's place,
you don't!
He's got a knife.
Look what he did.
My God, Frank.
Frank! Frank!
Are you okay?
Did you see him stab me?
It was so cool and effortless.
Okay. Okay.
Let's go. Come on.
Jesus. Aren't you supposed
to be getting me my money?
Pal?
Dad?
My name's not Pal.
They call me the Butcher.
Alex! Stranger danger!
Fuck!
Don't forget about the Burner!
Yeah!
Shit!
Put him out! Put him out!
I got this!
No, no, no!
That's vodka!
Are you kidding? Help!
I got it!
No, no, no!
That's vodka, too!
God!
Wait, no! That's polyester!
I've got an idea.
Everybody, back up!
All right.
Ouch!
Stop!
What's with these people?
I did it!
Frank!
Frank, you saved his life.
Everybody, everything's
gonna be just fine.
I was wrong!
I'm sorry.
You were right about me.
I will sign
the divorce papers.
As long as you print
a new copy,
'cause the ones that you gave
me burned up in the house.
I fucked everything up.
I know.
But we have insurance.
They don't know that I took
all the furniture
and jewelry and stuff.
Raina...
What?
Are you suggesting that
we commit insurance fraud
together?
What, Frank? I'm just sayin'.
That's one of
the most fucked-up things
I've ever heard.
But,
you guys kind of
did it all for me.
So, thank you.
Honey, don't thank us.
The money's all gone.
You can't go to Bucknell.
We are so sorry.
We had it,
but then Bob Schaeffer
took it from us.
The asshole that
took my scholarship?
If he stole it from us, why
don't we just steal it back?
'Cause we don't
do that anymore.
Once you go to the dark side,
it gets dark very quickly.
Trust me.
I see fingers everywhere.
Are you guys serious?
You've been doing this
insane stuff all summer,
and now that I have a chance
to help, you just wanna quit?
Good afternoon, folks.
Excuse me? Hello?
Mom?
Don't be alarmed.
I'm not here to arrest you.
What you did
was self-defense.
We are alarmed,
you're in our backyard.
Ignore the badge.
Ignore the gun.
Put it down.
What are you doing?
Put that down.
This is nothing
to be afraid of. Here.
People being afraid
of guns is silly.
And I'm sick of it.
Anyway,
I'm just here
to say one thing.
Fuck Bob Schaeffer.
He doesn't care
about this town.
Here's what we're gonna do.
You're never gonna
believe this, Bob.
They never shut down
the casino.
They just moved it
to another house.
But I told them
if they kept it open,
that I would
have them arrested.
There are
Smurfs who are taller
than Bob Schaeffer.
He looks like a gremlin
learned how to tie a tie.
Don't get him wet
after midnight.
Hey, guys!
I found the casino!
For God sakes, I'm short!
They're making
fun of you, Bob.
Hello, I'm Bob Schaeffer.
You told them to shut it down.
Cop car. Now.
Can't wait to see their faces
when we get there.
Come on.
Okay.
Yeah, right there!
Okay, here you go.
Okay.
All right.
What's the combination?
It's okay, I know.
Officer Chandler told me.
And right now...
I completely remember it.
It's okay,
I know, I know, I know.
Dad, there's no time for this.
Hide!
Hey, how's it going?
Good.
I need that by tomorrow.
No, I'm serious, though.
All right. Bye.
Okay, Scott...
Honey, I have
faith in you, okay?
Yeah.
I know that you can remember
four sequential numbers.
Just think. Just think.
Squiggly line.
Is that part of
the combination?
Poop. Poop emoji?
Is that part of it? No.
I love you so much, Dad.
I'm gonna miss you
next year at college.
29-52-41-78 pound.
I remember!
You did! Good job!
I'm gonna miss you,
too, sweetie.
Okay.
Good job.
Okay.
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.
Honey, there's wheels.
I got it. What?
It's got wheels!
You can wheel it.
It does.
Okay, yeah. So much easier.
Just drag the suitcase.
Careful!
The floor is slippery.
Are you meeting
with the Johansens?
I think I saw them
come into Town Hall.
Dawn,
they can't be there.
We're going to
arrest them right now.
Well,
they're here somewhere.
Your office door is open.
Wait, so is the safe.
What? I'm coming back!
Go faster, Chandler.
I'm driving safely, Bob.
Punch it!
Bob, I'm going
the speed limit.
Punch it, Chandler. Let's go.
I won't.
Back to Town Hall now!
You stop it!
Stop doing that!
No!
Watch out, Chandler!
That's why you don't punch it!
Great, just great!
Fuck you, Bob Schaeffer!
You wrecked my car! You pig!
Stop it.
Look what you did!
Ma'am, we have to
exchange information!
Fuck the police.
There you go.
There we go.
Your family fucking sucks!
Stupid fucking money bag!
No! Not the model!
I handcuffed it to my wrist,
you fucking shithead!
So, what are you gonna do
about it now, Scott Johansen?
You're not talking
to Scott Johansen.
What?
You're talking to...
No. No.
The Butcher.
No!
I thought you were gonna
cut off my arm.
So did I. I'm so glad
I didn't do that.
God.
Chandler, God.
Chandler, arrest
these people, please.
I don't think so, Bob.
I like them a lot more
than I like you.
Are you kidding me?
So, that's how
it's gonna be?
Yeah.
Don't touch the fucking money.
It's fine.
All I need is
my sweet, sweet Dawn.
Bob, is that all cash
that you stole from them?
Yep.
Yeah, he did.
All of it.
Come on!
I took that money for us,
for our future.
What future?
What are you talking about?
I wanted you
to be my First Lady.
You're never
gonna be president.
You're too short.
Dawn?
What's going on in here?
Joe...
My God, the model.
And you know what, Bob?
I'm already
somebody's First Lady.
I'm coming in
for a kiss right now.
Here I come.
Way to go, Joe.
Did I get you that necklace?
What?
You know what?
All I do is give!
What about me?
What about Bob?
What's so funny?
There's a movie.
What About Bob?
Yeah. Richard Dreyfuss,
Bill Murray.
Am I the only one
who doesn't get Bill Murray?
You're coming off
like a real dipshit now.
You're being
a piece of shit, Bob.
Don't judge me!
Yeah, I took the money!
I took the money
from the Johansens
and I took the money
from the town.
But I deserve it!
I'm so glad you said
that clearly, Bob.
'Cause we've been recording it
on all of these cameras.
What? What?
God!
I'm gonna go shoot Bob.
No, no, no.
I'm gonna go arrest Bob.
That a boy!
Anyway, those cameras
weren't turned on.
I just said that
to freak him out.
Are you kidding me?
That was badass.
I totally bought that!
Come on.
Let's go, guys?
It's okay.
It's okay.
You got it.
I love you guys.
Thanks for getting me
into college.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, you?
Yeah.
You know,
I thought losing Alex
would feel like losing
my best friend.
Yeah, me, too.
But it's not.
Alex is my daughter,
you're my best friend.
You're my best friend.
And you're not just
my best friend,
you're the baddest
mofo around.
Whom I fucking love.
Did you just say "whom"?
'Cause you're giving me
a straight-up boner, girl.
Grammar has always
been your thing.
Yeah.
Math, not so much.
I know you.
I wanna feed you soup
when we get old.
I really hope that
I don't die before you.
Because I don't know
how you're gonna
make it without me.
I know.
I think about that
all the time.
Okay.
For another day.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
You mind pulling up?
We're just having
a little trouble getting out.
Where are you gonna go?
Soccer moms.
Hey!
Wrong couple
to fuck with, pal.
You're fucking crazy!
I'm starving.
Yeah, me, too.
God, he was scared shitless.
