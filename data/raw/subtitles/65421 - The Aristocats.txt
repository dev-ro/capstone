Marie, my little one...
you're going to be as beautiful
as your mother.
you're going to be as beautiful
as your mother.
Isn't she, Duchess?
Careful, Toulouse!
You're making it very difficult
for Edgar.
Whoa, Frou-Frou, whoa.
Steady, girl.
Thank you, Edgar.
Oh, of course, Frou-Frou.
I almost forgot.
Madame, uh, uh, may I take
your parcel, Madame?
It really is much too heavy
for you, Madame.
Now, tut tut, Edgar.
Don't fuss over me.
Berlioz, come back here. Haven't you
forgotten something, darling?
Thank you, Miss Frou-Frou, for
letting me ride on your back.
- You're quite welcome, young man.
- How was that, Mama?
Very good, darling.
That was very nice.
Come along, Duchess, kittens.
Come along.
Oh, and Edgar, I'm expecting
my attorney, Georges Hautecourt.
You remember him, of course.
Of course, Madame.
How could anyone forget him?
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Oh!
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de...
Whoops! Oh, ho, ho. I'm not
as spry as I was when I was 80. Eh?
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ah, good day, sir.
Madame is expecting you, sir.
Evening!
Evening, Edgar.
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Oh, another ringer, sir.
You never miss.
Come on, Edgar. The last one
up the stairs is a nincompoop.
Uh, uh, could we take
the elevator this time, sir?
Oh, oh, that birdcage?
Poppycock!
Elevators are for old people.
Whoops!
Uh, may I give you a hand, sir?
You haven't got an extra foot,
have you, Edgar?
That always makes me laugh, sir.
Yes. Ha, ha. Every time.
- Whoa, ah! Let go of my cane!
- Ooh, ah, careful, sir.
Oh, please.
l-l-I'm frightfully sorry, sir.
Don't panic, Edgar.
Upward and onward.
Whee!
Am I going too fast
for you, Edgar?
Oh, please, sir, hold...
There now, Duchess.
That's better.
We must both look our best
for Georges.
He's our oldest and
dearest friend, you know.
Come in.
Announcing Monsieur...
Georges Hautecourt.
Oh, my goodness, Edgar,
I know Georges.
Adelaide, my, my dear.
So good to see you, Georges.
Ah, still the softest hands
in all of Paris, eh?
You're a shameless flatterer,
Georges.
Adelaide, that's, that's music!
It's from Carmen, isn't it?
That's right.
It was my favorite role.
Yes, yes!
It was the night of your grand premiere
that we first met, remember?
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.
Champagne.
Dancing the night away.
Oh, Georges!
Oh.
Oh, thank goodness.
Just in time.
Ah, Georges, we're just a pair
of sentimental old fools.
Now, Georges, do be serious.
I've asked you to come here on
a very important legal matter.
Uh! Oh!
Splendid, splendid!
Who do you want me
to sue, eh?
Oh, come now, Georges.
I don't wish you to sue anyone.
I simply want
to make my will.
Will, eh?
Will. Will.
Now then, who are
the beneficiaries?
Well, as you know,
I have no living relatives...
and naturally, I want my beloved cats
to be always well cared for.
And certainly no one can do this better
than my faithful servant, Edgar.
Edgar?
Adelaide, you mean to say you're
leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?
Everything you possess?
Stocks and bonds? This, this mansion?
Your country chateau?
Art treasures? Jewels?
And, and...
Oh, no, no, Georges.
To my cats.
- To your cats?
- Cats!
Yes, Georges, I simply wish
to have the cats inherit first.
Then, at the end
of their life span...
my entire estate
will revert to Edgar.
Cats inherit first!
And I come after the cats.
l, me, after... No.
It's, it's not fair! Oh!
I mean... Ooh!
Each cat'll live about 12 years.
I can't wait...
And, and each cat has nine lives.
That's... Four times 12,
and multiply by nine times.
No, it's less than that. Well, anyway,
it's much longer than I'd ever live.
I'll be gone.
No. Oh, no.
They'll be gone.
I'll think of a way.
Why, there are a million
reasons why I should.
All of them dollars.
Millions.
Those cats have got to go!
- Wait for me. Wait for me.
- Me first. Me first.
Why should you be first?
Because I'm a lady,
that's why.
Ha-uh. You're not a lady.
Ha-uh. You're not a lady.
You're nothin' but a sister.
I'll show you
if I'm a lady or not.
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.
Fight fair, Marie.
Females never fight fair.
Ah! Now that hurt.
Mama, Mama!
Marie, darling, Marie,
you must stop that.
Th-This is really not ladylike.
And, Berlioz...
but such behavior is most unbecoming
to a lovely gentleman.
Well, she started it.
Ladies do not start fights...
but they can finish them.
Berlioz, now don't be rude.
We were just practicing
biting and clawing.
Aristocats do not practice
biting and clawing...
and things like that,
that's just horrible.
But someday we might meet
a tough alley cat.
Now, that will do.
It's time we concerned ourselves
with self-improvement.
Now, you want to grow up to be lovely,
charming ladies and gentlemen.
Now, Toulouse you go and start
on with your painting.
Yes, Mama.
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint
before we start our music lesson?
- Please?
- Well, yes, my love, but...
- Whoops.
-you must be very quiet.
- Uh-oh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
- It's Edgar.
- Yeah, old pickle puss Edgar!
Old pickle puss!
Now, now, Berlioz.
That is not kind.
You know Edgar is so fond
of all of us...
and takes very good care of us.
Rock-a-bye kitties
Bye-bye you go
La-la-la-la
And I'm in the dough
Oh, Edgar,
you sly old fox.
Oops! Oh, dear.
A slip of the hand
and it's off to dreamland.
I say, that's not at all bad.
Slip of the hand, dreamland.
Now, let's leave Toulouse
to his painting.
Now, dear, you go to the piano.
Now, run along, both of you. Go ahead.
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.
It's time to practice
your scales and your arpeggios.
Ouch!
I'm ready, maestro.
Oh! Mama,
he did it again.
- Tattletale.
- Now, Berlioz.
Now, please, darling,
settle down...
and play me
your pretty little song.
Yes, Mama.
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do
Every truly cultured
music student knows
You must learn your scales
and your arpeggios
Bring the music ringing from
your chest and not your nose
While you sing your scales
and your arpeggios
If you're faithful
to your daily practicing
You will find your progress
is encouraging
Do, me, so, me, do, me, so, me
Fa, la, so it goes
When you do your scales
and your arpeggios
Do, me, so, do...
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do
Though at first it seems
as though it doesn't show
Like a tree
ability will bloom and grow
If you're smart you'll learn
by heart what every artist knows
You must sing your scales
and your
Arpeggios
Ah, good evening,
my little ones.
Your favorite dish
prepared in a very special way.
It's creme de la creme
a la Edgar.
Sleep well. l, I mean,
eat, eat well, of course.
Good evening, Duchess.
Hello, kittens.
- Hello, Roquefort!
- Hi, Roquefort!
Uh, good evening
Monsieur Roquefort.
Mmm. Something smells
awfully good.
Mmm, what is
that appetizing smell?
It's creme de la creme
a la Edgar.
Oh, won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?
Well, yes. l, I mean, well,
I don't mean to interrupt.
But... But it so happens
that I have a cracker with me.
Come on, Roquefort,
have some.
Oh, thank you.
Don't mind if I do.
Just a few dunks.
Mmm. Ooh, very good.
My compliments
to the chef.
Mmm, this is yummy.
Mmm, delicious.
Double delicious.
This calls for another cracker.
I'll be right back.
So that's...
creme de la creme...
a la Edgar.
Lafayette.
Hey, Lafayette.
- Lafayette!
- Well, I'm right here.
Listen.
Wheels approachin'.
Oh, Napoleon, we done bit
six tires today.
Chased four motorcars
and a bicycle and a scooter.
Hush your mouth!
It's a motorcycle.
Two cylinder.
Chain drive.
One squeaky wheel,
on the front, it sounds like.
Now, you go for the tires, and I'll go
right for the seat of the problem.
How come you always grab
the tender part for yourself?
'Cause I outrank you,
that's why.
Now, stop beatin' your gums
and sound the attack.
No, that's mess call.
Made a mess of it, huh?
You can be replaced,
you know.
Okay, let's charge.
Wait a minute.
I'm the leader!
I'm the one that says
when we go.
Here we go.
Charge!
Nice doggie, nice doggie.
Heel, roll over, play dead.
Yeow!
This sure beats runnin',
Napoleon.
- Step on the gas, Napoleon.
- I got her wide open.
Ow!
Yeow!
Oh! Oh, where am I?
I'm not at home at all.
Children, where are you?
Answer me.
Children, where are you?
Answer me.
Berlioz, Toulouse, Marie,
where are you?
Here I am, Mama.
Marie, darling.
Ar-Are you all right?
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare
and fell out of bed.
Now, Marie darling,
n-now, now don't be frightened.
- Mama! Mama!
- That's Berlioz!
Over here, darling Berlioz.
Here we are.
A-And don't worry. Everything
is going to be all right.
I'm comin', Mama.
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.
Mama?
Mama?
Mama!
Oh, darling.
That's only a little frog,
my love.
But he had a mouth
like a "hippolotamus."
Oh, what's so funny?
Now, now, darling... Darlings,
now you just stay here...
and I go and I look
for Toulouse.
Toulouse!
Toulouse, where are you?
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
- Hey.
What's all the yellin' about, huh?
Why didn't you answer?
Mama, he's been here
all the time.
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh.
A-Are you all right?
I was having
a funny dream.
Edgar was in it.
And we were all riding
and bouncing along...
Frogs? Uh-oh, it wasn't a dream.
Edgar did this to us.
Edgar?
Oh, darling, why, that's...
Why, that's ridiculous!
Yeah. Maybe you fell
on your head, Toulouse.
Mama, I'm afraid.
I wanna go home.
Now, now, my darling, now don't
be frightened. You'll see...
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Now, let's
get into the basket, all of us.
What's gonna happen to us?
Why, darlings, l,
I just don't know.
It does look hopeless,
doesn't it?
I wish we were home with Madame
right now.
Oh, poor Madame.
She'll be so worried
when she finds us gone.
Duchess? Kittens?
Oh, my gracious! I had the most
horrible dream about them.
Thank goodness
it was only a dream.
Oh, dear,
what a terrible night.
Now, now, my darlings.
Don't be frightened.
The storm will soon pass.
Oh! Oh, no!
They're gone!
Duchess! Kittens!
Duchess, where are you?
They're gone!
They're gone!
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?
Why, that's terrible!
But where? Why?
Good heavens! Anything could happen
to them on a night like this!
Get, get washed down
a storm drain.
Struck by lightning.
Oh, they'll need help.
I've just got
to find them.
Duchess! Kittens!
Duchess!
Kittens!
Kittens!
I like a chee-chee-chee-chee-rony
like they make at home
Or a healthy fish
with a big backbone
I'm Abraham Delacey
Giuseppe Casey
Thomas O'Malley
O'Malley the alley cat
I've got that wanderlust
Gotta walk the scene
Gotta kick up
highway dust
Feel the grass

Gotta strut

Showin' off my eclat
Yeah
Tellin' my friends
of the social elite
Or some cute cat
I happen to meet
That I'm
Abraham Delacey
Giuseppe Casey
Thomas O'Malley
O'Malley the alley cat
Oh, why, monsieur...
your name seems to cover
all of Europe.
Well, of course.
I'm the only cat of my kind.
I'm king of the highway
Prince of the boulevard
Duke of the avant-garde
The world
is my backyard
So if you're goin'
my way
That's the road
you wanna seek
Calcutta to Rome
or home sweet home
In Paris
magnifique you all
Oh, boy! An alley cat!
Shh, shh. Listen.
I only got myself
And this big old world
But I sip that cup
of life
With my fingers curled
I don't worry
what road to take
I don't have to think
of that
Whatever I take
is the road I make
It's the road of life
Make no mistake
For me
Yeah
Abraham Delacey
Giuseppe Casey
Thomas O'Malley
O'Malley the alley cat
That's right
And I'm very proud of that
Yeah
Bravo! Very good.
You are a great talent.
Well, thank you.
And what might your name be?
My name is Duchess.
Duchess.
Beautiful.
Love it.
And those eyes.
Ooh.
Why, your eyes are like
sapphires sparkling so bright.
They make the morning
radiant and light.
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.
Oh, c'est tres jolie,
monsieur.
Very poetic.
But it is not quite Shakespeare.
'Course not.
That's pure O'Malley, baby.
Right off the cuff. Yeah.
I got a million of'em.
Oh, no more, please.
I am really in
a great deal of trouble.
Trouble?
Helping beautiful dame...
uh, uh, damsels in distress
is my specialty.
Now, what's the hang-up,
your ladyship?
Well, it is most important
that I get back to Paris.
So, if you would be just
so kind and show me the way.
Show you the way?
Perish the thought!
We shall fly to Paris
on a magic carpet...
side by side...
with the stars
as our guide...
just we two.
Oh, that would
be wonderful.
Three? Four?
Five?
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.
These are my children.
Oh, how sweet.
Do you really have
a magic carpet?
- And are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.
Mama, do I have sparkling
sapphire eyes that dazzle, too?
Ooh, did I say that?
Yes, right off your cuff.
And you said we're gonna ride
on a magic carpet.
Well, now, uh, what I meant...
You see, l...
No poetry to cover this
situation, Monsieur O'Malley?
Well, what I had in mind was
a kind of a sports model, baby.
- You know, one of those...
- Uh, perhaps a, a magic carpet
built for two?
I wouldn't take up much room.
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.
Well, come along, darlings.
I'm a tough alley cat, too.
Hey, there, you're comin' on.
I'll bet you're a real tiger
in your neighborhood.
Yeah. That's 'cause I practice
all the time.
Now, now, Toulouse, Toulouse,
come along, dear.
Yes, Mama.
See ya around, Tiger!
Ha-ha. Now, that's
quite a family.
And come to think of it, O'Malley,
you're not a cat, you're a rat.
Right? Right.
Hey! Hey, hold up, there!
Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?
Now, look, kids,
if I said magic carpet...
magic carpet
it's gonna be.
And it's gonna stop
for passengers...
right...
here.
Oh, boy!
We're gonna fly after all.
Ah, another flight into
the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?
No, no, no, baby!
No, no, no, baby!
Now, you just hide over there and you
leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.
- Quick, Mama, get in here.
- But, but, children...
Hurry up, Mama. Hurry.
One magic carpet comin' up.
That's a magic carpet?
Stupid cat!
Brainless lunatic!
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.
Why, Mr. O'Malley,
you could have lost your life.
So, I've got a few to spare.
Nothin'.
How can we ever thank you?
My pleasure entirely.
Aloha. Auf Wiedersehen.
Bon soir. Sayonara.
And all those
good-bye things, baby.
Sayonara, Mister... Oh!
- Mama!
- Marie! Marie!
- Oh, Marie, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.
Haven't we met before?
Oh, and I'm so very glad we did.
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley,
for saving my life.
No trouble at all,
little princess.
And when we get to Paris, I'll
show you the time of your life.
Oh, I'm so sorry, but...
Well, we just couldn't.
You see, my mistress will be
so worried about us.
Well, humans don't really worry
too much about their pets.
Oh, no.
You just don't understand.
She loves us very much.
Poor Madame,
in that big mansion...
all alone.
In all our days,
in tender ways...
her love for us was shown.
And so, you see...
we can't leave her alone.
She'd always say that...
we're the greatest treasure
she could own...
because with us
she never felt alone.
Oh, Roquefort, I've been
so worried about you.
Did you have any luck
at all?
Not a sign of them,
Frou-Frou.
And I've searched
all night.
I know, and poor Madame
didn't sleep a wink either.
Oh, it's a sad day
for all of us.
Morning, Frou-Frou,
my pretty steed. Ho-hmm.
Can you keep a secret? Hmm?
Of course you can.
I've some news
straight from the horse's mouth.
If you'll pardon the expression,
of course. Ha.
Look, Frou-Frou,
I've made the headlines.
" Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats"
- Well, aren't you proud of me?
- So, he's the catnapper!
The police said it was
a professional, masterful job.
The work of a genius.
Not bad, eh,
Frou-Frou old girl?
Oh, they won't find a clue to
implicate me. Not one single clue.
Why, I'll, I'll,
I'll eat my hat if they...
My hat!
My umbrella!
Oh, oh gracious!
l, I've got to get
those things back tonight.
But... Ooh, you...
Why, that sneaky, crooked...
no good butler of...
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?
- Where is it?
Right under
that magic carpet.
But now we have to cook up
a little spell.
You know.
You ready?
All right. First,
to make the magic begin...
you wiggle your nose.
And tickle your chin.
Now, you close your eyes...
and cross your heart.
Then presto!
Breakfast a la carte.
- Hurray!
- We did it!
- Look, Mama, look.
Why, Mr. O'Malley,
you are amazing!
True. True.
Thieves! You robbers!
Mangy tramps!
Take that and that!
Oh! Oh, what a horrible,
horrible human.
Well, some humans
are like that, Duchess.
I've learned to live with it.
I'll show him.
Meow!
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.
That guy's dynamite.
But he called us tramps.
Oh, I'll be so glad
when we get back home.
Well, that's a long way off
so we better get movin'.
Gee whiz!
Look at that bridge!
- Come on, let's play train.
- Now, be careful, children.
Marie's the caboose.
All aboard!
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Clickety, clickety,
clickety, clickety.
Whoo! Whoo!
- Oh, no!
- All right, now, don't panic.
Down underneath here.
Mama!
Marie! Oh, Marie!
Keep your head up, Marie.
Here I come.
Thomas! Thomas, up here.
Gee, Marie, why'd you have
to fall off the bridge?
Thomas! Oh, Thomas!
Take care!
I'm all right, honey. Don't worry.
I'll see ya downstream.
What beautiful countryside,
Abigail.
Oh, so much like
our own dear England.
Oh, indeed yes.
Amelia, if I walk much further,
I'll get flat feet.
Abigail, we were born
with flat feet.
I say,
look over there.
Oh! Oh, how unusual.
Well, fancy that.
A cat learning how to swim.
And he's going about it
all the wrong way.
Quite.
We must correct him.
Sir! Sir!
You are most fortunate
we happened along.
Yes, we're here
to help you.
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doin' fine.
First, you must gain self-confidence
by striking out on your own.
Go away.
I'm tryin' to get to shore.
You will never learn to swim properly
with that willow branch in your mouth.
Indeed not!
Snip, snip.
Here we go.
Don't do that!
You're doing splendidly!
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.
Ooh, he takes to water
like a fish, doesn't he?
A very enthusiastic pupil.
No. Now, this is no time
for fun and games.
Gracious, Amelia.
You don't suppose...
Oh, yes! Yes, I do!
Bottoms up!
- Deeper!
- Deeper!
Look, Ma, there he is.
You really did quite well
for a beginner.
Oh, Thomas!
Thank goodness you're safe.
- Keep practicing!
- And toodlely pip.
Can I help you,
Mr. O'Malley, huh?
Help? I've had all the help
I can take.
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so
much for helping Mr. O'Malley.
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.
Yes. We British like
to keep things proper.
Now, now, I am Amelia Gabble,
and this is my sister...
- Uh, Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.
- You might say we're related.
- Oh, silly thing.
How nice.
I never would have guessed.
- Look, they got rubber feet.
- Yeah!
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.
- Uh, swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.
Of course.
Uh, Thomas, this is Amelia
and Abigail Gabble.
Yeah, honey. Get those two
web-footed lifeguards out of here.
Now, now, Thomas.
Okay, okay, baby.
Hiya, chicks.
Oh.
We're not chickens.
We're geese.
No! I thought
you were swans.
Ooh! Ooh! Flatterer!
Your husband is very charming
and very handsome.
Well, ha, uh...
You see, l-I'm not exactly
her husband.
Exactly? You either are
or you're not.
All right.
I'm not.
- Oh?
- Oh? Hmm.
- He's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.
- Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
- A roue.
- Mmm, his eyes are too close together.
- They're shifty, too.
- And look at his crooked smile.
- His chin is very weak, too.
Obviously a philanderer who trifles
with unsuspecting women's hearts.
How romantic.
Please.
Please let me explain.
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
He's just helping us to get to...
Come on, Duchess, come on.
Let's get out of here.
Well, girls, see ya around.
We're on our way to Paris.
Ooh, how nice.
We're going to Paris ourselves.
Why don't you join us?
I think that's
a splendid idea.
Oh, no.
Now, uh,
you stand here, dear.
And, uh, let's see,
uh, you take this position.
- Uh, Duchess, you will do nicely here.
- Yes, very good.
And, and you, dear,
you take this place.
Oh, now that leaves
Mr. O'Malley.
Oh, we can't leave him,
can we?
Mr. O'Malley, I think
you should be the rear end.
Ready, everyone?
Now, think goose.
Forward march.
Mama, do we have to waddle
like they do?
Yes, dear.
Think goose.
When we get to Paris,
you must meet Uncle Waldo.
- Waldo?
- Yes, he's our uncle.
We are to meet Uncle Waldo
at Le Petit Cafe.
Le Petit Cafe? Oh, that's
that famous restaurant.
Ah! C'est magnifique.
Oh, he bit my finger!
Get out! Go! Go!
Get out! Scram!
Good riddance!
Why, why, it's Uncle Waldo!
Uncle Waldo!
Abigail! Amelia!
My two favorite "nooses."
Uncle Waldo. Tsk, tsk. l, I do
believe you've been drinking.
Oh, dear! What happened
to your lovely tail feathers?
Girls, it's outrageous.
Why, you won't believe
what they tried to do...
to your poor old
Uncle Waldo.
Look! Look at this!
" Prime Country Goose

in white wine."
Basted? He's been
marinated in it.
Dreadful!
Being British,
I would have preferred sherry.
Sherry! Sherry.
Oh-oh, oh, oh!
Oh, Uncle Waldo,
you're just too much.
You mean,
he's had too much.
- Uh, Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, yes.
We best get
Uncle Waldo to bed.
Ah, I say there now.
What's all the whis-whispering
about, huh?
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Now, now, now, now, girls.
Girls!
Don't shush
your old Uncle Waldo.
Why, you'll, you'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.
- Shh.
- Whoopee!
- Shh.
- No.
- Neighborhood.
- Oh, come along, Uncle Waldo.
- Oh, yes, I think we'd better be going.
Oh, right-o, girls.
Birds of a feather must
"hic" together.
That's stick together.
I'll say!
- Girls! Girls!
- Shoo, shoo, shoo.
You know somethin'?
I like Uncle Waldo.
Especially when
he's marinated.
Frou-Frou,
here comes Edgar.
Hurry, Roquefort,
hop aboard the motorcycle.
And for goodness sakes,
do be careful!
Frou-Frou, tonight operation
catnapper will be completed.
Wish me luck.
Fisherman's luck.
Bye, Frou-Frou.
Ooh!
Lafayette!
Lafayette, listen.
Oh, shucks, Napoleon. That ain't
nothing' but a little ol' cricket bug.
It's squeaky shoes approachin'.
Oh, cricket bugs
don't wear shoes.
Hush your mouth!
Let's see.
They're oxford shoes...
size nine and a half.
Hole in the left sole,
it sounds like.
- What color are they?
- Why, they're black...
Ah, now how would I know that?
Hey, now the squeakin'
has stopped.
I still say it was
a little ol' cricket bug.
I'm the leader.
I'll decide what it was.
It was a little
ol' cricket bug.
I'll see you in the mornin',
Napoleon.
That's my hat!
I'm the leader!
Well, shoot fire! Don't get sore
at me. I ain't done nothin'.
Ooh, oh, hey.
Ooh!
Mmm, that feels good,
Lafayette.
That's all right.
A little lower
and faster there.
I'm scratchin' as fast
as I can.
Right there! That's good!
Oh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh!
Mmm, it's so warm and...
mmm, cozy.
Wh-Wh-What's goin' on? Lafayette,
what in tar nation are you tryin' to do?
Aw, I get blamed
for everything.
Wait a minute!
Where's my hat? Where...
And somebody stole
my bumbershoot.
Well, where's
my beddie-bye basket?
And whoever it is,
is gonna get it and get it good.
This time,
I get the tender part.
Hush your mouth!
Now, come on.
Hey, N-Napoleon,
oh, it's them shoes again!
Yeah, yeah, I hear' em.
Napoleon, I'm plumb
goose-pimply scared.
Now, this is no time
to turn chicken.
I got a feelin' this case
is gonna bust wide open.
Ah, d-d-d-did, did, did,
did you see him?
No, no. He sneaked up
behind me and tailgated me.
- Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.
- Shh, shh.
Listen.
Sounds like a one-wheeled,
oh...
- A one-wheeled what?
- You're not gonna believe this...
but it's a one-wheeled
haystack.
Hey! There it goes!
Come on, after it!
- I got him, I got him, I got him!
- Ouch! That's me!
Oh, wow.
Oh, get him, get him,
get him, get him!
Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.
Ow! Ohh, ohh, ohh!
Criminently!
Thomas, Madame will be so worried.
Are you sure we can't get home tonight?
Mama, I'm tired.
Me, too!
And my feet hurt.
Look, baby, it's late,
and the kids are bushed.
I'll bet we walked
a hundred miles!
I'll bet it's more
than a thousand!
Now, now, darlings,
cheer up.
Mr. O'Malley knows a place
where we can stay tonight.
How much farther is it,
Mr. O'Malley?
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.
It's just beyond that next chimney pot.
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's
peaceful and quiet. And you'll...
Oh! Oh, no!
Sounds like Scat Cat
and his gang have dropped by.
Oh, friends of yours?
Uh-huh, yeah. They're old buddies.
And they're, they're real swingers.
Swingers?
What is a swinger?
You know, uh, not exactly
your type, Duchess.
And, uh, maybe we'd better find
another place. Huh?
Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see
your pad, and meet your Scat Cat.
Well, okay.
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some
of that sweet stuff my way.
Well, lookie here! Big Man O'Malley
is back in his alley.
Swing on down here, daddy!
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.
Yeah!
Welcome home, O'Malley.
Duchess, this is
the greatest cat of'em all.
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you,
Monsieur Scats Cat.
Likewise, Duchess.
You're too much.
Oh, ho-ho,
you are charming.
And your music is so...
so different,
ah, so exciting.
It isn't Beethoven, Mama,
but it sure bounces.
Say! This kitten cat
knows where it's at.
- Knows where what's at?
- Well, little lady,
let me elucidate here.
- Knows where what's at?
- Well, little lady,
let me elucidate here.
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at
Tell me, everybody's pickin'up
on that feline beat
- 'Cause everything else is obsolete
- Strictly high-button shoes
A square with a horn
makes you wish you weren't born
Every time he plays
But with a square in the act
you can set music back
To the caveman days
I've heard some corny birds
who tried to sing
But still a cat's the only cat
who knows how to swing
Who wants to dig a longhaired
gig and stuff like that
When everybody
wants to be a cat
A square with a horn
makes you wish you weren't born
Every time he plays
Oh, a rinky, tinky, dinky
With a square in the act
you can set music back
To the caveman days
Oh, a rinky, tinky, tinky
Yes, everybody
wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at
When playing jazz
you always has a welcome mat
'Cause everybody digs
a swingin' cat
Oh, boy, fellas,
let's rock the joint!
Groove it, cats.
Shanghai, Hong Kong
egg fu yung
Fortune cookie
always wrong
That's a hot one!
How about you and me,
Duchess?
Yes, let's swing it,
Thomas.
Groovy, Mama, groovy!
Blow it, small fry, blow it.
Boy, he blew it!
But he was-a close!
- Mmm!
- Beautiful!
If you want to turn me on
Play your horn
Don't spare the tone
And blow a little soul
Into the tune
Let's take it to
another key
Modulate
and wait for me
I'll take a few ad-libs
and pretty soon
The other cats
will all commence
Congregatin'
on the fence
Beneath the alley's
only light
Where every note is
Out of sight
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Hallelujah
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
I'm tellin' you
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
- Yeah
- Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
- Mmm
- Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
- Hallelujah
- Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody wants
to be a cat
Because a cat's
the only cat
Who knows where
it's at
Oh, yeah
Happy dreams, my loves.
I'll bet they're on
that magic carpet right now.
They could hardly keep
their eyes open.
Oh! Such an exciting day.
It sure was.
And what a finale!
Thomas, your friends
are really delightful.
I just love them.
Well, they're kind a rough,
you know, around the edges.
But if you're ever in a jam,
wham, they're right there.
And, wham,
when we needed you...
you were right there.
Hmm, that was just
a lucky break for me, baby.
Oh, and thank you so much
for offering us your home.
Oh, I mean your pad.
- It's very nice.
- Well now, wait a minute.
You know, this is
the low-rent district, remember?
No, no, no, I like it!
Well, uh, well, all it needs
is a, is a little tidying up.
And, well, maybe a,
a little feminine touch.
Well, if you're applying
for the job, well...
Goody! Mother's going
to work for Mr. O'Malley.
Boy! Your eyes
are like sapphires.
Gee! Ha. That's pretty corny,
though, huh?
Oh, no! Not at all.
Any woman would like it.
l, I mean,
even little Marie.
Yeah. All those little kittens,
Duchess, I love 'em.
And they are
very fond of you.
- Yeah!
- Well, you know,
- Shh.
- they need a...
Well, you know, a sort...
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.
Oh, Thomas, Thomas,
that would be wonderful!
Oh, darling,
if, if only I could.
- But why can't ya?
- Because of Madame.
l, I could never leave her.
But, but Madame's...
well, she's just
another human.
You're just her house pets.
Oh, no, no! We mean
far more to her than that!
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear...
but we just have
to go home tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well, I guess you know best.
But I'm gonna miss you,
baby.
And those kids!
Gee, I'm gonna
miss them, too.
- Well, we almost had a father.
- Yeah.
Let's go back to bed.
Good night, Duchess.
Good night, Thomas.
Hey! Meow!
What a classy neighborhood!
- Dig these fancy wigwams.
- Wigwams?
Are you sure we're
on the right street?
Yes. Yes. Let's hurry.
We're almost home.
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!
Oh, no! Edgar!
I've got to do something quick!
Edgar, old chap, get used
to the finer things of life.
Ooh, someday they're all going
to be yours, you sly old fox.
Oh!
Oh, he got me!
- Hurray, we're home!
- Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first! Me first!
It's locked.
Come on!
Let's all start meowing.
It can't be them!
The kittens!
Don't come in!
Go away! Away!
Look! There's Roquefort.
- Hi, Roquefort.
- He's sure glad to see us.
I don't know what to say.
I only wish that l...
Maybe just a...
short, sweet good-bye
would be easiest.
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.
- Bye.
- So long, baby.
Don't come in!
Look out for Edgar!
Duchess,
wherever have you been?
Look out for the...
sack.
Well...
I guess they won't
need me anymore.
You came back!
Oh, it, it just isn't fair.
Edgar! Edgar, come quickly!
Coming, Madame, coming!
I'll take care of you later.
Oh, Edgar, they're back!
I heard them!
Hurry, hurry, let them in.
Duchess? Kittens?
Come here, my darlings.
Where are you? Come on.
Uh, allow me, Madame.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
His name is "O"' what?
His name is O'Malley.
O'Malley.
Abraham Delacey
Guiseppe Casey.
Oh, never, never mind.
Just run, move, go get him!
Yes, yes, I'm on my way!
I told you it was Edgar.
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.
I'm afraid it was just
the imagination of an old lady.
But I was so sure
that I heard them.
I'm so sorry, Madame.
Mr. O'Malley!
Hey, stop!
Duchess, kittens in trouble.
Butler did it.
Duchess and kittens
in trouble?
Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats.
A-Alley cats?
But I'm a mouse!
- Look, I'm gonna need help.
- You mean you want me...
Move! Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble.
" No trouble," he said.
Well, that's easy for, ah,
for what's-his-name to say.
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.
What's a little swinger like you
doin' on our side of town?
Oh, please, ah, I was sent here
for help by a cat.
Why, this is outrageous!
This is crazy!
Kinky!
Oh, but, but honest!
He told me just to mention his name.
So, start mentioning name,
rodent!
Now... Oh, now, wait a minute,
fellows.
Lo... Don... Look, don't, don't, don't,
don't rush me. His name is O'Toole.
I don't dig him.
Strike one.
Oh, ooh, O'Brien!
- Strike two.
- Oh, boy.
- You believe me, don't you?
- Keep talkin', mousey.
H-How about O'Grady?
Huh?
Mousey, you just struck out.
Any last words?
Oh, no, oh! Why did I listen
to that O'Malley cat?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
Hold it, cats.
This little guy is on the level.
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level!
Oh, we didn't mean-a to,
to rough-a you, squeaky.
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.
Duchess and the kittens
are in trouble.
Come on, cats.
We gotta split.
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!
Now, my little pesky pets,
you're going to travel first-class...
in your own
private compartment...
all the way to Timbuktu.
And this time,
you'll never come back.
Oh, oh, oh,
we-we-we've got to hurry.
The baggage truck will be here
any moment now.
Ooh!
Over there!
They're in the trunk!
Quiet!
Everybody out of here fast.
You're going to Timbuktu...
if it's the last thing I do.
Well, Mac, this must be
the trunk, eh?
Yup! And she goes
all the way to Timbuktu.
Heave ho!
Now, my pets,
a little closer together.
Good! Good!
Look, Georges,
what do you think?
Very good, very good!
But I think we should
get on with the will.
Yes, yes, of course.
But you know what to do.
Very well.
Scratch one butler.
You know, Georges, if Edgar
had only known about the will...
I'm sure he never
would have left.
Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back.
And I think this young man
is very handsome.
Shall we keep him
in the family?
Of course we will.
We need a man
around the house.
An-and, Georges, we must be sure to
provide for their future little ones.
Of course!
The more the merrier.
Now, don't move.
Smile.
Say cheese!
Did somebody say "cheese"?
Thank you.
Now, run along downstairs.
There's a surprise for you.
Adelaide,
what's that music?
Sounds like a gang
of swinging hep cats.
That's exactly what
they are, Georges.
They're the start
of my new foundation.
What foundation?
My home for all the alley cats
of Paris.
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody, whoopee
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be
A cat
Hey, Napoleon,
that sounds like the end.
Wait a minute.
I'm the leader.
I'll say when it's the end.
It's the end.
Oh, yeah
