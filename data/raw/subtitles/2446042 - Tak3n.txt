I'm fine!
I'm just gonna take the dog for a walk!
Nice office
Nice family
Sorry to disturb you at
this time of night, but...
we have a little problem.

a lot of money

I'm just account. I
don't know anything.
You don't need to know anything
Except the combination to the safe
You do know the combination, yes?
Yes.
Perfect, please.
Get in
Hello my friend, it's Malankov
I came to your office
to collect my money
What a disappointment
to see it's not here.
But I'm leaving you
something here in return.
as a reminder
I can not wait any longer
My best to the family
Sweet.
Yeah.
How old?
No matter how old they are, my friend. They
will always be our baby -Ain't that true?
Come on big guy.
Thank you!
Happy birthday! Dad.
Wow!
My birthday is not even for 3 days.
Your always saying I'm so predictable. I wanted to shake
things up a bit and make it a little less predictable.
Sorry, come in
Champagne glasses
You know me. Why would
I have Champagne glasses?
Or a giant stuff panda. I heard that.
Inappropriate, huh.
Well, I mean...
Not if I was 7.
Well I can I can return it or you can hang on
to it until you have a 7 year old of your own
Not funny.
Hey baby! Babe! Yay!
Hey, look who's here.
Mr. Mills
Hello Timmy
How are you? Good, you?
You know. Hey! Hi.
Hey, if you guys are having father
daughter moment I can really...
No, no, no, I just dropped
by thought I'd do something.
Unpredictable. Kim is always
pointing out how predictable I am.
That's funny coming from her.
You wanna talk about predictable.
I'm not predictable. Come on!
Every single day she goes to the same exact
store, right off campus, every morning before class
gets the same peach yogurt drink, right? The 4th one from
the back, not the 5th one, not the 3rd one, right? Stop.
Cause it's still cold.
I know. I would do
exactly the same thing
Yeah, the OCD gene
So, whats with the bubbly?
Pre-birthday
celebration -Nice
If you don't mind, I think it's just a little early to pop open
a bottle. -Yeah. Yeah, no problem. I'll put it in the fridge.
What was that?
Well, I'll leave you two
Dad font...
You don't have to take
it. Now I feel bad.
- Yeah, you should feel bad. I'll
exchange it for something more predictable.
Love you. Take it
easy, Jimmy. -Alright!
Hey, how you doing? Is something wrong?
Nothing -You sure, babe?
How'd it go?
Great, fantastic. It
couldn't have gone better
The panda was not a hit, i take it.
Careful what you say. He's
sitting right next to me
When did she grow up, Lenore?
I know
It goes so fast. All of it
Where are you?
just going home. Make a little dinner
If you'd like to join
us. Us? Me and the panda
I'll uh...
I'll take a rain check on
that. If thats OK with you?
And the panda
That's fine by us
I'll see ya.
See ya
I know what your thinking
Keep it to yourself
Hey -Lenny
You changed your mind -Yeah
You left the door open. -Come on in
OK
I'm not intruding or anything. -Of course
your not, I was just preparing dinner, drink?
Yes, please.
Thanks for coming over
Cheers -Cheers
You look stressed. -Yeah. Why?
Stuart and I...
we've tried everything. Therapy,
counseling, together, separately
He wants it to work. He really does.
And you? -I know I'm hurting him
I just don't feeling anything anymore.
I hate that. I hate not feeling. I hate going through
the motions. They only thing I feel is trapped.
I have the worst taste in men. -Thanks
Oh my God!
I wasn't talking about you.
Oh God, I'm sorry. -Its OK.
Do you know what I fantasize about?
I'm afraid to ask
Us
Yeah?
Right after the guilt comes
roaring in, I feel like such a shit
Does that make me a bad person? Being
married to one man, fantasizing about another?
Confused, maybe. Bad, no
You must think I'm crazy
If you are Lenny,
you're not the only one
Lenny
I'm sorry. -No
This lead that you are apologizing.
It's not that I don't want to, believe me
But until you and Stuart clear up your
situation, I think it would do more harm than good
For all of us
Why do you have to be so damn honorable
Believe me, right now I wish I weren't
I'm gonna go. -Wait!
Here
I'm going out of town in a couple
of days, for a month, on a job
If you ever feel you need to go
to someplace just to be by yourself
Use it
Thank you
Will the rest of you gentlemen please.
Seriously, it's money. It'll be fun.
I know. I can't go
It's a four man job. We
can't do it without you
I know, I know, but a couple of things have come up and
I'm not comfortable being away for a month right now. -Kim?
It's not Kim.
Man, you got to let this go. Lenore is a
grown women she can take care of herself.
Your not her husband any longer.
But she is my friend
I think you better talk to somebody about this.
- A shrink maybe?
Why would I go to a
shrink when I got you guys?
Well there's a good point
Could somebody drop the flag stick?
Hey Kim, what's up?
- You want me to take it out?
- If you wouldn't mind.
Sure! When?
- Oh come on.
- OK, baby.
OK, the big moment.
Come on!
- That's a good...
- Oh!
Well, this is an unexpected treat
Yeah, I um...need some advice
OK, shoot.
So, its um...
I guess its not something I was really
planning on here or even thought about.
ever.
Anyway, I just wanted your advice.
I'm flattered.
Wow.
Poor lady.
That it going to be serious trouble
in a few years. You mark my words.
So, what was it you wanted to ask?
Um...
Um...Puppy.
- A puppy?
- Yeah, I was thinking about getting a puppy.
- From where?
- Um, my friend found one behind a building.
- Uh huh
- We were trying to find it a home.
You know we put it on Facebook,
but nobody claimed it yet, so.
Wanna know what I think?
I mean its alot of work, alot of responsibility,
and with your lifestyle and your going to college
Yeah.
But a puppy you have to
be there all the time.
Feed it, walk it. No
different than having a kid
- Have you had a chance to look at the menu?
- Not yet, Annie.
What will I have?
- Stuart.
- Hey Brian.
- What are you doing here?
- Um...
Everything alright?
- Yeah, its fine, its fine.
- Can I talk to you inside?
- Yeah, yeah, sure. I was just making some coffee.
- Milk? Sugar?
- Um, both please.
OK.
- Milk, cold or hot?
- Uh...
Hot.
- So, how's business?
- Oh, you know. Some days good. Some days great.
Yeah.
- One sugar or two?
- Two, please.
- Here we go.
- Thanks.
Um...
I'm sorry to bother you this late,
but I thought it was more um...
respectful to say what I have to say you.
Face to face. Man to man, so to speak.
Listen, I know that Lenore has
she's spoken to you about the
problems that we've been having.
um
Your a good guy, Brian. I
like you. Your a respectful guy
And listen, I'm not
accusing you of anything. But
Lenore and I If your
marriage is gonna work,
that can't happen
with you in between us.
Stuart, there's nothing between
Lenore and I other than we share Kim.
I didn't say there was.
You know obviously you share a daughter and
your tried to be the best father that you can.
Under the circumstances.
And part of that means the two of
you talking and staying in touch.
But, I still want you
to stop seeing my wife.
Until we sort things out.
Does she know your here?
Doesn't matter if she does or if she doesn't. That's not the
point. I'm asking you to stop seeing my wife. Can you do that?
I can do that.
Wow, that's great. Thank you.
You know I got to go to Vegas tonight some business
meeting tomorrow. I really don't want to be worrying about
- you know
- Yeah.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
Need to see you. Urgent. Bagels.
I'll have four bagels and
some cream cheese, please.
- OK, be careful they're really hot.
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.
- Take care. -Thanks.
Hello?
Lenny?
Lenny?
Lenny?
Lenny?
Jesus Christ! Lenny, wake up!
Come on, come on, come on! Lenny!
Freeze! Don't move!
- Get your hands up!
- Sir, back away now!
Step away from the knife!
- I didn't do this.
- Get your hands up, now!
Slowly!
- Get your hands up!
- You got to listen to me!
- One the floor, now!
- Listen to me!
- Down on the floor, now!
- Listen to me!
On your knees!
Now!
Put your hands up!
Hands up!
Hands up!
Higher! Higher!
I didn't do this.
Shit! Over there!
Get em!
Come on, he's heading west!
Stop!
Get inside. I'll be back.
Police, freeze!
- Door is sealed. I just saw him inside.
- Shit!
Clear! Moving in!
You see him anywhere?
He disappeared.
God damn it, he's gone.
This is 103, suspects gone.
- Yeah
- Kim, Its dad.
Where are you?
I'm at mom's. Looking
for my yellow sweater.
Are you alone?
Stuarts in Vegas, why?
I have something to tell you.
Dad?
Dad, whats wrong?
Something terrible has happened and
I wanted you to hear it from me first.
Your mom...
She's dead.
Someone murdered her.
In my apartment.
It looks like I did it. I don't know why,
I don't know who, but I'm gonna find out.
Listen carefully, Kim.
- No matter what anyone says, don't trust them.
- No.
- You hear?
- I'll find a way to contact you.
- Dad?
- Try to be strong.
- Dad?
- I love you.
Wait!
You need to check this out, alright?
Sargent Dotzler, suspect
name is Brian Mills.
His?
His.
Not his.
Your officers happen to see him because?
We got this call. Came in reported a women
screaming, "He's killing me, he's killing me"
Her name is Lenore St. john.
We sent a card to her address
that was listed on her license.
Her daughter was there but her husband
was in Las Vegas on some business
He's, uh, taking the first flight home.
Any witnesses?
The cameras didn't see anything at all.
Call came from an unlisted number
I'll had them checked
out the cells as well
Download both the
phones. Encrypt the data.
I wanna know when these two people...
spoke, text, emailed.
Every form of communication.
Date, times, durations of calls.
Lets bag this.
Take that. Bag it up.
What's wrong?
Good.
Right now this is still
a very active crime scene.
investigators have been here, on
the scene, all morning but so far,
police have not told us what happened inside the apartment
where, earlier this morning, a women's body was discovered.
Brian Mill's is the owner of the apartment
and the ex-husband of the deceased.
- Who's this?
- It's me.
- Your on the news
- i didn't do it, Sam.
Obviously you didn't
do it. Are you alright?
I'm going down the rabbit hole.
- The code still the same?
- Yeah, yeah, its still the same.
- I'll be in touch.
- Be careful.
So this is the area we lost him, sir.
It got fetched.
Uh, thats the gun that he took
off one of our officers, sir.
He had a gun?
And he didn't fire at you?
No, sir.
And the Helicopters? Saw nothing?
Choppers didn't see anything, Sargent.
I know he's good.
But
Vanish into thin air?
Lets move the truck.
Do you know why your wife
went to visit Mr. Mills?
No, I don't know.
You know there relationship was
mostly centered around their daughter.
Um, but I think that he
wanted more than friendship
I asked her to speak to him and tell him
that she should stop bothering her about it
So you think that's what
she was doing over there?
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?font
Stuart? Why are they going
through my mom's stuff?
Hey Kim.
Mrs. St. John.
- Franck Dotzler.
- Mills.
My name is Mills.
Can I just have for a few minutes of
your time. Ask you a few questions.
Why aren't you out there
trying to find out who did this?
Instead of standing around
going through our home.
We can't be bound through looking
But in order for me to get a full picture, I
have to ask questions of him and questions of you.
My mom went to see my
dad. I don't know why.
Probably to talk about me.
Look, there's just
he didn't do it!
- He just didn't. He didn't do it. There's no way on earth he would
- Come on, Kim.
Just don't!
He loved her.
That's all I know.
Please.
That's mine. That's not even hers.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
- God!
- Come on, lets get you home.
If something comes to
mind, anything at all.
You know it might not be anything, um...
You know what happen in Paris and Istanbul, a
couple of years ago, were Bryan saved his family.
Sure, you that's connected to this?
You know, I never really wanted
to know all the details. But,
A lot of people ended
up dead and now this?
So what your telling me is...
I'm dealing with a very dangerous man.
No!
Brian's not dangerous.
The world he lives in is.
He loves his family.
But he has a lot of enemies.
I see.
Bring him into room 3.
Garcia, will uh, get you back home.
Thank you.
This guy is a ghost.
at 21
he's in the army
at 23
he joins special forces.
He's good.
No service records. No
discharge. Nothing! Nothing!
Sounds like spy shit to me.
And until we have another
suspect, he's our man.
So here's our best way of finding him.
His daughter with the deceased.
The husband says that he
is really close to her.
Devoted to her.
So lets keep a close watch on her.
Where she goes, who she
calls, who she talks to.
Lets not screw this up, OK?
So this is gonna be our
best shot at finding him.
Do we have the deceased car?
Yeah, that just came in.
- There it is still.
- Alright.
Garcia. Smith.
Go sweep the car. GPS download
it see where it went and when.
see if they correlate.
See if we can find out what's going on.
Just came in, its a nerves.
Lets go then.
Follow me.
So, what's this about?
- Some guy offed his ex.
- Allegedly
Right.
Allegedly
- He didn't do her in the car, did he?
- Nah, at his house.
Good, I hate to clean it up after.
Blood.
pieces of flesh and
shit that is disgusting.
Which GPS you want done first?
His.
- His first.
- Right over her.
What the hell were you doing
all the way out there, Leonore.
Excuse me.
Inspector Malry LAPD.
We're following up on a
missing person investigation.
Was wondering if you've seen this women?
Nope.
- She was her about 10pm last night.
- I was here then.
I didn't see her.
Didn't see hardly nobody.
not exactly a best selling
destination if you know what I mean.
Hey, Sarah.
Excuse me, duty calls.
Amanda
Excuse me.
Inspector Malry LAPD.
Are these security cameras operative
or are they just there for show?
Yeah they work.
Follow me.
You have the tape from yesterday?
No I wasn't here. The other guy was.
If someone was here, it'd be on there.
Just push that button for playback.
I'm just gonna stay here
while you look at that.
you have problems with this system?
It breaks down sometimes. They keep
saying their going to replace it.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this women?
- You fellows should get more coordinated.
- Coordinated?
What you mean? Like color coordinated?
No, like one of your guys was
just in here asking the same thing.
One of our guys?
- Him?
- Yeah.
Him.
Took off to the gas station.
Shh
Freeze!
Mr. Mills!
Step out buddy!
Freeze!
Get up out of here!
Freeze!
Stop what our doing, Mr.
Mills. Step away from the desk!
- Back away from that desk.
- Step away from that desk!
I'll shoot you!
Step away from the God Damn desk, now!
Step away one step from the desk!
Just keep your hands
were we can see them.
Stay perfectly still!
You know the drill.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in the court of law.
You have the right to an attorney. If
you have one present during questioning...
Garcia and smith, they got him.
- He's here?
- Yeah, just picked him up.
Easy peasy
If he was a pro, like you said.
He wasn't on his game today.
- He's playing you.
- What are you talking about?
- Where is he? Where is he?
- He's back in Phillips care, why?
- Stop the cars!
- What!?
Stop the cars!
Now!
Aw, come on.
- Phillips.
- Yeah.
Our boss has got a hair up his ass about
something. Just keep an eye on this guy, alright?
Yeah, OK.
They think we're idiots.
It's unbelievable.
- He acts like I never done this before.
- He's just being Dotzler
Nah, you know what it
is? He's a control freak.
If he's not doing it
himself, he's not happy.
Keep driving!
Phillips!
Come on!
Oh my God! What the hell is he doing!?
Pull it over!
Back it up!
Get out of the car!
Drive!
Drive, Come on!
Now move!
Radio!
Cell phone!
- This is gonna end bad for you.
- Don't be such a pessimist
Connecting to LAPD computer files
Calling unit a code 10-29
on police con number 706
Number 706.
Suspect in sight!
Move! Move! Move!
LAPD! Freeze!
Send some back up, now!
Dotzler
By now I'm sure you know who I am.
You know what I'm capable of.
CIA operative. 66' 67' what?
All you have to know is I'm innocent.
Give me 2 days and I can prove
it. I can find out who did it.
You may very well be
innocent, Mr. Mills.
But that's the courts
job to decide, not mine.
My job is to bring you in and let
nature take its course. Thats it.
Good luck.
Hey, I got a GPS on the phone. He's
heading North. You want me to send units?
Don't bother. He's gone.
- Dead end.
- Wait, wait.
- He wants us to watch it.
- Why?
I don't know yet.
Who she waiting for?
Who are these guys?!
Holy shit!
Who are these guys?!
Get me a tech guy. I need some magic
done on a security tape, now. Right now!
Hey, let me guess.
Pile up on the 710N
massive cluster of police
vehicles 15 miles heading south
Sounds about right.
Hey, thanks Sam.
You want to tell me what's going on?
Lenore sent me a text.
Asked to come over to
my place for bagels.
I got the bagels.
When I came back, I
found her car out front.
she was in my bed with
her throat slashed.
and
Oh Jesus.
What else?
I found a location on her
car's GPS from the night before.
She was out of this gas
station in the middle of nowhere
I saw it on the security camera
She was snatched.
What do you want us to do?
I downloaded all the phone records
from the police files. I'm on it.
Maybe there's something there.
I didn't notice that this
Her hair
It might turn up something.
It might turn up nothing.
Anything else?
I want to go to the funeral
The Bible constantly tells us
that there will be
difficult times in life.
When we feel like we are walking
to a dark, dangerous valley.
- Valley of the shadow of death.
- Are you OK?
But what the Word of
God does make very clear
is that as we move through such times
the LORD is my Shepard and He maketh
me to lie down in green pastors
He leadeth me besides still waters
In the name of the Father
and of the Son
And of the Holy Spirit
you already know
Right there.
Get me sound on that.
Right there.
Kim.
I'm so sorry.
If there's anything we can do
Hey
We're there for you.
You know that, right?
Hey baby
I just want to go home
You hear that?
Hear the click?
Yeah, I'm getting some
interference somewhere.
He's gonna go to Kim now
- Hey
- Hi
Oh sweetie
They're jamming our signal
I know
I'm so, so sorry
I know
Listen
He'll be in touch
just stick to your schedule
Your very predictable schedule
You want me to put a tail on him?
Nah, it's a waste of time.
They're always about winning
These guys could lose a tail
if it was attached to a dog
We're done.
Cut the feed
Stuart, why are there still
Why are there still cops camped outside?
Uh, I think it's just
standard operating procedure.
What do you think my dad
is gonna show up here?
Are they stupid or something?
I don't know what they think.
Inspector Dotzler asked
if we minded and I said no
You should have asked me.
I mind
I'm sorry
And who's he?
Well, we um...
we need protection
Kim, honey, I know it's hard
on you but it's hard on me, too.
I'm sorry I didn't realize
it was a competition
It's...
it's not a competition, please.
Don't hate me
I'm not responsible for what happen
I don't hate you, Stuart
But for the last 2 years
every time I looked into my mom's eyes
the only thing I saw was hurt and sadness
And for that, I do hold you responsible
- Where're you going?
- School
If I'm allowed
Why are you following me?
It's for your own protection, miss.
Protection?
From who?
My father?
You really think my
father would hurt me?
Your mother probably
didn't think so either
Asshole
- Hi
- Hey
Drink me now
Anything?
She's on campus. You want me to follow?
Is the bug active?
Yes.
OK, stay near her
Really soon. If he shows up we're here
She went to this convenient store and chugged
down a drink of some kind from the fridge
What else?
Was it skinny or fat?
Uh huh
As you might remember last week
We discussed dissociation and interactions between
dorsal and ventral streams in object recognition...
Is that the dorsal stream is supporting
motor interactions with objects
while ventral streams structures extract visual
information about the object that is independent
I'm feeling a bit nauseous
- Can you right the notes for me?
- Yeah, sure
Now in other words, object knowledge
is represented in ventral streams
Thanks
- Excuse me, I wonder if you could help me out with something.
- Sure
There was a young women
in here. About an hour ago
Poor kid
Oh yeah
She come here often?
Everyday
- She bought when?
- Same thing. Peach, yogurt, drink
But today, she drank it all
right there from the fridge
Must have been thirsty
Yeah, she went to school.
Got nauseous in class
Get anything?
Now she's on her way to the bathroom
Call for back up! I'm coming right now!
Shh
Here Kim, drink this. I put something
in the yogurt to make you nauseous
this will take it away
Hi baby
Hi
Oh Kimmy
Oh Kim
Dad
I don't know what to do
I'm pregnant
What?
I'm pregnant
I'm OK
Dad
I have low blood sugar. I
haven't eaten since yesterday
Eat this
Don't, don't you worry
Lets get through this first, and
then we'll figure out what's best for
What you have to do, Kim, is act
natural. This cop is really smart.
Anything out of the usual
he becomes suspicious, OK?
I love you
I love you, too
Yes?
Where are you?
I'm in the science building east left
- She's in the bathroom.
- Don't move.
Wait for me.
Where are you staying?
I'm still at mom's
I started packing her stuff
it just...
it doesn't feel real
Oh I know
I know
Dad there's...
Stuarts been acting really weird
He must be scared about
something. He hired body guards.
Oh my God it was so fun. But
you know what he was such a jerk
- Really?
- He made me pay for my own drink at the bar
- I did! I was wearing something like more skimpier than this
- Really? More skimpier than that?
They'll hear you
I'm not gonna do it again there.
I completely understand
Oh!
Move, move, move, move, move
Excuse me!
Perv!
He just left.
She's in the can.
I can't let you leave.
Seal entrances
Hey!
There he is.
Gotta stop the water!
Freeze!
I know you think your helping him.
But your not
Your not.
This we can't recommend
I can't start trying to
make sense of what happened
Someone killed my mom.
That's what happened
It was not my father
We haven't heard his side of the story
They can't know that can they?
I do.
Is there anything else?
You know we can arrest you for
obstructing an ongoing investigation.
Arrest me.
I rather not.
Well then, If your not going to
can I go home?
Course.
Course.
Thank you.
Interesting family
Don't worry.
We will take care of this.
Do as we planned.
Call the car
Where are we going boss?
Malibu house.
Okay, lets go get drunk.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I need a ride.
- Mind if i drive?
- OK.
You can go.
You when you stand in the
field with a box of matches.
Uh huh
You can have hundreds of
rabbits in seconds like this
- You know how?
- No.
Come in all rabbits
Come in all rabbits
Like this
Who hired you?
Huh!
Who are you working for?
Your accent is shit!
Who are you working for?
I'd rather die than tell you!
Boss, they're at the gate.
Well let them in.
Oh, and take a stroll.
I need a little privacy.
Manny?
Manny!?
Bryan.
Oh, God no, please!
None of this is making
any sense to me, Stuart.
I was hoping you could help me out.
How did you...
Survive the crash?
The Russians who were following
me when I was following you
- They work for you, Stuart?
- No.
I don't know what your talking about.
What do you know!
The only thing I know is that
you were screwing my wife.
And I know that she's dead
No! No! Not...
What do you know!
I don't know anything
I swear I don't know anything.
If I believed that, we wouldn't be here!
No! No! No!
What!?
Malankov
Oleg Malankov
- Who is Oleg Malankov?
- I owe him money.
You don't know him.
He will never give up.
Its only a game for him.
I lost everything
- He said he'd kill my family
- Why didn't you tell this to the police?
You let them think it was me.
I was angry with you God damn it. You
promised, you promised to stop seeing her.
So what do you think happen?
She came over to my place.
This Malankov followed her there
If you weren't seeing her being my back, she wouldn't
have been there in the first place, would she?
They would have killed
her someplace else.
So why are they coming after me?
Because I told them who you were
That you would find them and kill them.
How convenient would that be for you.
I kill them. Your debt is canceled.
I'm sorry, Bryan.
But I loved her. You gotta believe
me. I loved her, I loved her.
Well, here's what your gonna do.
Your gonna go to the police
and tell them everything
I can't
I can't. He's crazy. You don't know
him. You can do whatever you want.
Either way, I'm a dead man.
I'm dead.
They kill you, they don't get paid.
Your not the one they're
gonna come after next.
Kim.
Hey!
Can you get your keys, please?
- Do you know what your
getting yourself into,man?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Could
you get your keys and your phone, please?
you mind putting your
hand on the steering wheel?
Or what?
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?
Left or right?
Go ahead, put the cuffs on.
Thank you very much.
Dad!?
Dad!?
Lets go Kim.

Dotzler
He took the daughter
out of St. John's house.
What?
Fucking sake, man!
I'll be there right away
- Anything yet?
- No
Nothing came up from the
samples you gave me, but
it's gonna take a while to sort through,
Bryan. There's a shit load of data here
What is that?
I downloaded the police computers.
For what?
First thing they're going to look at are the
phone records to see if there are any clues.
I mean what's it gonna tell ya?
That you and Lenore spoke to each other?
Hey, you know what? Don't worry about
it anyway. We're almost done here anyway.
So what's the plan?
The plan is to make
sure my daughter safe.
And the only way to do that, so it seems, is to
eliminate the thing that would make her unsafe
- Malankov.
- Good one, Stuart
I'd like to help
Oh your gonna help, alright.
Like bait helps to catch a shark
Excuse me?
Start talking about Malankov.
I want to know every detail.
Where he lives.
Who he is
What he does
Where he works.
Oleg Malankov
He's as tough as they come
He served in the Russian army
when they invaded Afghanistan
He was Spetnaz
It's like our Navy Seals.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
when everyone was grabbing what they could
there was a real demand for
men with his kind of skills
He become one of the grabbers
I met him when I was doing a
deal involving heavy machinery
Since then, we did business in
a number of different occasions
Some deals worked out
I don't have the money
Last one didn't
What?
My mom is dead because of one
of your shitty business deals?
No, no, no, Kim. That's not what happen
I knew it!
- It's his fault. He killed her!
- Kim.
- Let me go!

The elevators is controlled
by security upstairs.
Once they see who's inside
the elevator and give the OK
they'll send the elevator up
outside the elevator upstairs is the
security station and 3 more body guards
2 sets of doors
through the second set of doors
is Malankov's private apartment

Brooks

Black Porsche just spotted heading West
Yes.
Listen, Mr. Mills. It's Dotzler
I still have to piece
this thing together
There's two life insurance policies
One for St. John. One for
your ex wife, you understand?
Stuart owed money to these
Russians. A lot of it.
The ones who abducted her
The men then took her to my place
to kill her to keep me out of the way
I need you to step back
and allow me to handle this
I got it
What's your first
priority here, inspector?
To arrest St. John and charge
him with your ex wife's murder
My first priority is my daughter
Get out of the car
Come on, lets go
Go!
Kim's cell Santa Monica airport
OK, we're leaving now
- Come on, lets go.

Requesting clear for take off
Come on, guys. Come on, lets go
Requesting permission for take off
We got a visual on the Porsche
He's heading to Santa Monica Airport
I want all units in the area of the Santa Monica
airport to be on the look out for a black Porsche
89-90
No
Lets go, lets go!
Come on!
Go!
Give me the God damn gun!
Shoot you in the head!
Shut up!
Very smart.
Played me off against the Russians
Coming over for coffee
Taking my phone, sending
text, and then erasing them!
So that your pals could plant Lenore's
body and make it look as if I killed her
Well your problem solved
All your worries over
But it didn't quit work out that way
Listen, Bryan
They're coming
You can't kill me now
Oh yeah?
Dad.
I know you know alot of people
and with a good lawyer you'll
get out of jail in a few years
and then I'll come for you
I'll find you
And we both know what's gonna happen
I knew from the beginning
It was the bagels
They were warm
I mean I had to ask
myself what kind of guy
goes out for warm bagels
and comes back and commits a murder?
So, I compared
the time stamps to the deleted texts
That you downloaded from our computers
which by the way is illegal
and we could arrest you for it
either way, I could
But it's got me
and I was able to figure it out
She was leaving him
He needed the insurance
money to pay Malankov
you didn't help us out by escaping you
You figured what better way to get rid
of Malankov and keep the insurance money
than by getting me the kill
the guy who would kill him
because it was the only
way to keep my daughter safe
It almost worked
Almost
So, are we done, Inspector?
Course
course
We're done
Could you um, just stay in town for the next month or
so. Just in case I have a few other questions for you
Sure.
Now you two
I've though about this all night
It's um...
very important choice
whatever you decide
the two of you
together
I'll support you 100%
And I know your mom would
have said the same thing too
Tell em
Dad
We've been talking
We though that
If it's a girl,
we'd like to name her after mom
She'd like that very much, Kim.
