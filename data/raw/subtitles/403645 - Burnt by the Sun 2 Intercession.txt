 Is a pioneer-Komsomolets, 
 and even more pioneer-team,
 must respect 
 the decision of the Soviet authorities,
 Nadezhda Arsentiewa said 
 that parents are always parents
 and you should respect them and love
 regardless of the issued 
 by the recommendations.
 I reported their opposition.
 I said that parents-traitors
 deserve a full and absolute 
 pioneer contempt, or Komsomol.
 Pioneer or Komsomolets, 
 and even more pioneer-team,
 he went into the ranks of pioneering 
 or Komsomol organizations,
 has only one parent:
 Soviet Motherland 
 and the National Bolshevik Party.
 Excuse me, but why 
 I have just read to you?
 Thank you.

 That's it?
 Everything.
 Even the date and signature:
