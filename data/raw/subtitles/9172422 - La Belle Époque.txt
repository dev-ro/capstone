A gift from the Emperor?
He only gives me his bed.
Even then, it's just a loan.
Why must His Majesty torment the creature?
Because it's a bastard.
Like Mr. de Luynes, to whom I will do the same.
Majesty, such humor! Far from dulling you,
power makes you shine!
Sit back down, harlot.
You like men too much to flatter me.
I do like them!
To whet your appetite,
I've placed around you my handsomest treats.
By the way, dear,
are you pleased with your negro?
Quite!
May we touch?
Come closer.
Come on!
Closer, idiot.
Still closer.
It doesn't stain?
Hardly.
Imagine the pleasures such lips
might bring.
- What on earth?
- Shut up!
Part of the game?
Don't kill me, I'm an actress!
Phone down!
He's the client. He's loaded.
Hand over the dough.
He paid a company to reenact the period.
That's what these morons get off on:
denigrating Arabs and Blacks!
Shut up!
I run an import-export business.
Why snuff out a loser?
Spare me, I'm Muslim.
So am I!
So am I.
I'm Jewish.
Want my big lips?
- Look at your dad.
- He doesn't get it.
Not at all.
Look, he's suffering.
As if a dog were chewing on his balls.
In seconds he'll look up and say, "What is this?
"I don't get it. Is it a film, a series?
"It's creepy. Totally racist."
I don't get it.
What?
I don't understand. What is it?
- Didn't like it?
- What'd you say?
Your headphones, dear!
Why'd you want me to watch it?
It's the promo reel for a series
I'm producing for StarNet.
I didn't understand a single word.
He produces dramas for a digital platform.
Ok, but it's kinda racist.
Don't be silly!
Why's he laughing?
It's a satire, Dad!
Of course, it's a satire.
Sorry to be a schmuck.
But you need a schmuck at dinner.
No.
Pretty base, patting a black man like a dog.
Dad!
- Who'll watch that?
- Everyone!
Mom, relax.
- Everyone! Millions.
- On the Internet, is that it?
Yes, on the Internet.
On tablets, VOD, streaming. Words you don't know.
Sorry.
You don't give a shit.
It's true! He doesn't care what we do.
I'd like some wine.
With or without alcohol?
They make alcohol-free wine now?
Hurry. We only have 30 minutes to the next set.
I hear there are hot babes.
Does he know we don't do porn?
For the pilot
I was inspired by a real company.
A childhood friend does
tailor-made historical events.
Dad?
What?
Remember Antoine?
Who?
Antoine Beck. My friend who wasn't well.
You loved the kid! You lent him books.
Sorry, no.
I don't see who he is.
Anyway,
ten years ago he started a company
that's going great guns.
Since classical fiction no longer affects people,
he enables clients
to immerse themselves in any era.
The Middle Ages, World War II,
whatever.
Fine. Good evening.
May I see your shoes?
Ok, perfect.
Need more padding in there.
Pierrot.
LA BELLE ÉPOQUE
Light that one again, please.
Ok, perfect.
Very good.
Mathieu Molé? I told you, he's not born yet.
Sure, ok. But it's no go.
Good evening. This yours?
Take it off.
Put your cell phones away.
We have to capture the mood.
Focus, please!
Where's Paul?
Here.
What's your name?
Paul.
Tomorrow night.
Hans Axel von Fersen,
Swedish count and officer, in 17...
Don't give me Wikipedia, act natural. Birthdate?
Nineteen hundred...
- Unsure?
- No.
Yes, he is.
A little.
Never hesitate.
The client knows everything
about Marie-Antoinette.
Her dream is to be that bitch.
She's worse than I am.
Get it all down pat:
your biography, your character,
your tics, your lines.
Hello there.
Your lines.
It must cost a fortune.
It can, depending. Anyway,
his business is booming.
He just bought huge studios.
He operates round-the-clock.
He also rents a chateau.
I'm not surprised.
Nostalgia has become big business.
That's great.
How about you, Victor?
What period would you relive if you had a choice?
Prehistory.
When I slept with my wife.
Margot?
Hurry, they're opening!
Coming!
Reserved: Antoine
No earpieces, there's 40 of you.
We can't prompt everyone.
Is he still with Margot?
Didn't you hear?
She took a part in a theater play.
And?
He can't deal with her working elsewhere.
So he ditched her?
Who knows? Now it's him, now it's her.
- You invited Antoine.
- No.
Bullshit. I saw his name.
Where?
On the list.
It was out of courtesy.
Since when are you courteous?
Since I started smiling.
Nonsense, you cry every evening.
That's the role.
And my lines are ridiculous.
You cry over his lost child eyes.
Stop it!
- And his limp.
- Shut up.
And his huge wet dick.
You familiar with it?
Would that bug you?
Out of courtesy?
- Where to now?
- 1932
The Hemingway party. Starts in 45 min.
- Who's Hemingway?
- Sylvain quit.
She took Maurice.
The guy who did De Gaulle on New Year's?
He's way too old.
The only bilingual guy I have.
You who catch the stars with a wail
Drunk, full, modest
Tear the mainsail
Choose the appearance you want:
old, young, man, woman...
So if I speak, he'll answer me?
Not you.
Speech recognition doesn't work in German yet.
So you have no more patients?
On the contrary, I have 3000.
Per day.
We developed online psychoanalysis.
It uses algorithms of recurrent questions.
Aren't they handsome?
Like an exhibit on the Oedipus complex.
- Do you mind autographing this?
- On the contrary.
John Bolton's Ball
I only sold 3 copies.
- Your name?
- Brigitte.
It's my grandma's, from when I was a kid.
We read it on the john.
I'm Bruno. I handle your son's marketing.
He's a great boss.
Very kind.
He oughta be, with all he makes.
What are you on now?
Now? On a chair.
Here.
Thanks.
He conked out.
I beg your pardon?
My husband.
He's napping.
Maybe he's tired.
No, he's bored stiff.
What is this? Tomato juice?
- No vodka in it!
- I don't drink.
You...
- Hemingway doesn't drink?
- I'm not Hemingway.
Hemingway reeked of booze!
My name's Maurice.
It's ok. It's a Bloody Mary.
Tomato and tabasco mask the vodka.
I know. I can't taste the tabasco.
I just had a stomach flu.
My gut's fragile.
- Put vodka in his glass.
- He puked for 3 days.
You got the wrong man.
The clients want a binge with 3 alkies.
So give 'em vodka. Tabasco. Lots.
I don't care if they get sick.
Gentlemen...
Why's that painting here?
I don't know. She's gorgeous, though.
Very. And smart.
- And funny.
- I'd marry her.
Me, too.
You hung it there?
- No.
- Yes.
And me, inert, metallic
I extract my pleasure
from the fire of their tears.
A great evening.
Yes, it was.
Drive safely.
Sleep well?
Doors locking.
Shut up.
I mean the car.
When do we meet for that project?
Oh, yeah...
I'll call you tomorrow.
Start the car.
And here.
- For you.
- What is it?
- A gift, you'll see.
- Thanks.
Let's go.
Not opening it? Not curious?
It's probably another dumb gadget.
Don't you find his physique annoying?
Because he's handsome or rich?
You're so jealous!
Of who? My son?
In 300 yards, turn left.
but you love him so much as it is.
No threesome for me.
Turn left.
Shut that off! We're next door.
- I prefer the GPS voice.
- To mine?
You irk me. Your son's offering work.
I don't want to do video games.
It's an animation series.
I'm already working on a comic.
It's the same.
Drawings, characters, dialogue, a script.
But you might make money.
Money!
Action! Reread Freud:
"In the beginning there was action."
- Remember?
- Watch the road, please.
No need, it's a Tesla.
Well, it scares me.
Everything scares you, dear!
Turn left.
Shut up, bitch!
- Shit!
- What?
We're out of milk for tomorrow.
Would you go?
Sure.
- Doors unlocking.
- Thanks.
Let's drink to alcohol.
Oh, sorry.
Yes, darling?
I've had it, François.
What's wrong?
My reptilian brain's taking over.
I'm starting to feel the archaic
pleasure found in sadists.
I'm at my party, remember?
The historic thing with Faulkner and Hemingway.
- When do I see you?
- When you like.
Gotta go. Love you.
I mean, I'm crystallizing.
I don't get it. My credit card doesn't work.
What a nightmare.
Reassure me: The guns are loaded with blanks.
Shit!
Time Travelers
Dear Mr. Drumond,
Your son and I wish to treat you to a sequence
provided by Time Travellers.
Smoke detected.
Fuck you!
Shit.
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
A joint before bed?
No, but thanks.
What are you up to?
Testing a sleep atmosphere.
You blink and the setting changes.
It's rather delightful.
And you?
Testing a book made of paper.
Just turn the page to continue. It's cool.
I like to draw with a pencil and paint with paint.
And kisses with your lips.
Touch yourself with your hand.
How d'you shut this off?
Figure it out!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Not that!
- It relaxes me.
- Makes my teeth chatter.
- Chatter then!
- What?
Here, the guest room.
It's free for you to sleep in.
Be my guest.
You want separate beds?
Sleeping with you, I age faster.
When I think you continue
analyzing that scumbag who fired me.
You let all your patients go
except the guy who put me on the dole!
He's your best friend!
He was.
And somebody has to work!
Take off your mask so we can argue properly.
No! I hate your grandpa PJs.
I am a grandfather! You're a grandmother.
I don't look like one.
Take that off.
- Take that off!
- No!
Get out of here. Leave!
- Why?
- Because you're so critical.
So critical! It demolishes me.
At first it was funny. But it's grown old.
I think you've been alive too long.
At one point I thought: he'll kill himself.
He hates society. Progress.
He doesn't work. His son annoys him.
His wife can't stand him.
He'll top himself somehow!
But no, you're there, doing fine, watching us
and saying "Fuck you."
If only I were a widow!
Why say I don't work?
- You were on a comic?
- Yes, it's progressing.
It's been progressing for 4 years!
A backwards progression?
Nobody buys books.
Nobody buys your books.
Stop drinking.
I drink, I live, I move forward.
You should drink more often.
- What're you doing?
- Canning you. That's life.
Everyone has. You're the archetypal canned guy.
- Why should I leave?
- I pay the rent!
- Not even a cell!
- What for? To be like you?
Tapping on it day and night,
ordering everything on the web.
We don't cook. We don't go to the movies.
My bookshop closed, my record shop's gone,
my drawings are sold by antique dealers.
There's something else now.
Well, I don't like that something else.
Then beat it!
Be proud, hold your head high,
and face the enemy fire alone!
Are you drunk?
I can't even stand your clothes. Grey, black...
They even stink fresh out of the machine.
Careful, Marianne.
Keep talking to me like that and I'll split.
There!
And there.
Feel free.
I'm warning you, if I go out that door...
- Go on.
- Think it over.
Ok.
All done.
You can go. Only 10 more feet. You can do it.
"In the beginning was action."
What'll I do for money?
Ever consider prostitution?
You know what? I'm outta here.
Marianne, I'm leaving.
I swear I am.
I can't wait!
Well done!
Meanie.
Meanie.
May, 1974
Where'd he sleep?
No idea.
When do I see you?
Did you tell him?
Not yet.
Mr. Giraud!
What about you? How do you feel?
I don't know.
Good. Free.
Time Travellers Invitation
Darling, I want you to know...
Man! You scared me.
Sorry.
What brings you?
I thought I'd piss myself.
I think I did.
A few drops.
And? What'd he say?
How's the paper doing?
- You know...
- I don't care.
I understand.
You seem fine for a guy who canned 20 people.
Thanks.
A scotch?
Things good with my wife?
The sessions, I mean. They help?
Yes, she's tops.
I think she's cheating.
Marianne?
Yeah.
With who?
Everyone.
Anyone would do.
Even an asshole, a scumbag, some...
But younger than me. She wants novelty.
If it could make her younger,
she'd lick an infant's diapers.
That nut wants to live.
And you don't?
In these circumstances...
I understand.
You understand a lot.
Still cheat on your wife?
No, not at all anymore.
Shit, then.
Why?
Because of that bachelor pad you used to rent.
I had to give him the keys.
My husband lives at your place?
Yes. Makes him easy to locate.
I'm just playing.
- Where will we go?
- Your place.
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.
I want to love you everywhere. For real.
- At our age?
- You're ageless.
Really?
You're the youngest woman I ever loved.
Back to our session.
How are you?
I'm pretty good.
I dreamed of my brother.
What's that look?
I'm glad to see you, Dad.
When you died, Mom had me read your letters.
I discovered a kind, sensitive man.
I should've come to the funeral.
I'm truly sorry.
I was too afraid I'd cry,
that you'd rise from your coffin and say,
"Get a hold of yourself. We're not fags."
You used to say stuff like that.
It took me 15 years to shed my first tear.
Cry, son, cry.
Can I?
You must.
They're great this evening.
Like watching a Lelouch.
Gérard, try shedding a tear too.
I'm doing my best.
Would music help?
Yes, please.
I wasted my life.
I blew all your dough.
It's what I do best.
That, and regret.
At least you were driven.
You were tough.
But you were driven.
My dear son...
There we go.
It's working.
Good, isn't it?
They're gonna be fantastic.
This way.
Come in.
Please, take a seat.
Thanks.
First, a few questions.
May I ask what you do in life?
Be my guest.
What do you do?
Nothing.
Well, actually, I'm a cartoonist for a paper.
I caricature politicians.
Cool.
But the paper went bust,
or rather, it still exists,
on the Internet.
They don't take cartoons.
They take bullshit, but no cartoons.
Is that him?
- When would you like to start?
- The sooner the better.
I have few obligations these days.
No plans.
My life is totally empty.
Great.
Any ideas about what period,
or shall I make suggestions?
Actually, I like the year '74.
1974?
Yes, 1974.
May 16, 1974. In Lyon.
That's specific!
That day I met someone...
I was very fond of.
We were regulars at the same café.
Now it's a pharmacy.
And is this person living?
No, she's dead.
She died a few years ago.
That a problem?
Not at all. On the contrary.
On the contrary?
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
So, who would you like to be?
Myself.
So, you want to remain yourself?
Yes. Not that I love it,
but at the time, it wasn't horrible being me.
It wasn't great, but it wasn't...
It was better.
You don't sound convinced.
Yes, I am.
I'll explain how it works.
We'll contact you in a few days,
and someone will come for you.
Will it be in Lyon or...?
I don't think so.
We have several sets.
But the main site is nearby.
If it helps, I have a document.
A draft comic I found recently.
Sure.
It was in that café, in fact.
I was young, wasn't I?
That's perfect!
Pictures and all...
Careful with it. It means a lot to me.
Alright.
Hello, Mr. Drumond.
It's nice to see you. A good trip?
This is wild. The hotel disappeared in the 1980s.
But it feels so real.
Because it is!
Here's your key.
Room 14, isn't it?
Room 14, exactly.
We hung up your things.
What things?
Besides drawings, any photos, mementos...
I've left home. I don't have much.
When you say "tailor-made," it's not just hype.
No.
- Margot...
- No.
- Wait!
- What d'you want?
- You were fabulous.
- You only saw the end.
- Sorry, I didn't have time.
- I don't either.
How's it going?
You saw: SRO! We need a stadium.
That's why you must come back.
Fuck off! What d'you want?
I need you.
I don't!
I'm through with you. Got that?
It's not about us, it's work.
Both piss me off.
This time it's important.
Stop assuming I'll say yes.
I don't think that.
Yes, you think I'll say yes. I always do.
No.
Yes.
Don't stop.
No.
What is it? Who's the client?
Someone I know well. Who means a lot to me.
Someone means a lot to you?
Someone living, I mean?
As a kid, he gave me a book that saved my life.
I can't thank him.
It's a huge script. You'll have lots of scenes.
Can I improvise?
Why do actors always want to improvise?
Drop it. You have no self-control.
- Me?
- You'll chew me out.
You were staring into space!
I swear I wasn't.
Even when you deny it!
You aren't there. Where are you?
Margot?
Anyone seen Margot? Call Margot. Her cell:
We've rehearsed this for two days, and nothing!
It's not that hard!
What do we do meanwhile?
- How old are you, ma'am?
- 85.
She's 85.
I don't think she has all day
to wait until you stop diddling
and play these scenes!
Then you'll apologize.
Angel, don't cry. We have no time.
We're working. I'm sorry.
I don't mean you.
I mean the actress. The character.
Then you'll do it again.
We're not here to lick ass! Honestly!
If you have to be careful of every word, because
the lady's a china doll.
You can't hurt her. Can't offend her.
Change jobs if you can't take criticism!
Careful, she's sensitive.
The actress!
No! No! No!
We've rehearsed for two days,
and you can't even look at him.
Then apologize again.
You were superb.
The client was mesmerized. He loved you!
Sorry about earlier.
I was running late on the set.
No problem.
You should get help.
Me, get help? You broke my nose!
There's always something you think is off,
a line I said wrong. I'll never get it right.
You're the best.
Then why treat me so bad?
Ouch! My leg! Stop it!
Why?
I'm trying. I started meditating.
I'm seeing a specialist.
Careful! You're getting water all over.
Sorry.
Meditating!
He's a cartoonist.
Very popular in the 1980s.
What's my role?
The love of his life.
You're good at that.
Save it for your floozies.
Not staying?
I can't. I have a week to build the '70s.
We have to redo the façades of a '50s set.
Then go get fucked.
Don't forget this.
Good night.
Not busting any furniture?
Last time, you wrecked a dresser.
I meditate now.
Hi, gorgeous.
Hi.
Glad to see you back.
Lucky you.
Margot, can you hear me?
Unfortunately.
The client's on his way.
Get ready to roll.
Everyone have the material?
I'm talking to you!
Got it!
That couple's no good.
What's the matter?
Too cute, like an online dating ad.
No time to switch.
Ready? He's coming.
Amélie, listen...
See the girl behind you?
Mind replacing her?
Me? I'm no actress.
You'll be perfect. Right?
Totally.
Go change.
Ok, this should be fun.
I think so too.
Places, please.
Snap to it!
Everyone, light up.
C'mon, light up!
Hey, bud. How's tricks?
Good. Yeah, swell.
This café was my life, my office, my home.
I'd have slept there
if Yvon had let me.
How's it going, Mesrine?
In my memory, you were alive.
What did you like about the '70s?
Life was simpler. There were rich and poor,
right and left.
We defended immigrants without
a care for the economy.
Religious fanatics were less annoying.
People talked to each other, not their phones.
And I was younger.
Are your folks well?
Well, no.
I mean, yes.
I'm confused.
Your table's free in 5 min.
Great.
What'll you have while you wait? A Suze?
Suze, good idea.
Suze was good.
Give little Victor a Suze.
"Little Victor."
What are you reading?
France-Soir.
Thank you. What's your name again?
Dummy!
Jean-Claude.
You're Jean-Claude.
Right, Jean-Claude!
Moustache and southern accent.
Jean-Claude.
We found out he did heroin and that he OD'd.
It's not funny at all.
I don't know why I'm smiling.
It's just, seeing all this again...
They've done a great job. It's really well done.
May I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Who's the finance minister?
Finance minister in '74, quick!
'74, look it up.
Fourcade.
Jean-Pierre Fourcade.
Fourcade.
Wrong. If it's May 16, Fourcade came later.
It's Giscard.
Tell him you don't care about politics.
I don't give a shit about politics.
Right you are. When you see what it is today...
Only Coluche talks sense. He ought to run.
Veal blanquette at 20 francs? Sounds good.
It's excellent.
Sausage with lentils, mutton stew,
pork pie, coq au vin...
Now that's food! At least you die smiling.
Excuse me, don't take it badly,
but are you real, or an actor?
Client. Cost me a mint, too.
So we're sharing the same set?
I had a similar hangout,
so I'm piggybacking. Do you mind?
Not at all.
Except I was in Lille.
- What age did you ask for?
- 25
- And you?
- 18
No kidding!
Why not, while we're at it?
- Youngsters, another round?
- No thanks.
Youngsters! How ridiculous.
I love it.
And you manage to believe?
Sure.
You'll be surprised.
At first you're skeptical,
you resist, then gradually...
This is my second week.
Second week? You must have means!
My father left me a lot of money.
I'm meeting him this evening, like every evening.
Every evening I relive the moment
I wished we'd spent together.
Here he comes.
Dad!
- Have a nice evening.
- You, too.
He's crazy, isn't he?
Why?
Bud, if you're hungry, your table's ready.
Cool.
Dessert?
You'll think I'm nuts,
but do you have hard-boiled eggs?
With a little sugar?
I'll get you some.
I left him.
Who?
Your father.
And since you ask, yes, I met someone else.
I did.
Someone much younger, more positive.
You get the picture.
We'll probably move in together.
And since you ask, yes, at our place.
I love it. Why should I deprive myself?
I know what you think.
It's a bit late to fall in love.
But first, I disagree.
Second, I'm not in love,
but that's beside the point.
Spare me the prudish look.
Don't forget Freud:
"The festive feeling is produced
by the liberty to do what is prohibited."
So grant me the liberty
I gave you to marry a dipshit.
Nice place, here.
Do you come often?
- Here, Victor.
- Thanks, Lucie.
My pleasure.
Lucie, c'mere a sec.
What?
- When's quitting time?
- Why?
Because I love you.
I wrote you a song.
Cut the crap.
I swear. It's called "The Golden-Eyed Waitress."
She served me all my drinks
The waitress with golden eyes
And as I downed my drinks
I mused about her thighs
Call that a singer?
I'd love to down some more
With her I'd like to score...
How was I?
Where the hell's Margot? Freddy's started.
Calm down. I'm coming!
Take a Valium, get a blowjob
from one of your slaves,
but don't yell in my ear.
Hope your client likes drag queens.
Hot, hot, hot, hot...
Hey, rock stud, don't bust our ears.
Youth bothers you?
Jerks do. They often go together.
- Old fascist.
- Little fag.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
The first time I saw her,
I thought she was drunk.
Like a bowling ball knocking down pins.
Hey, doll!
Doll?
I thought you were ill.
You said a 104° fever.
When angry, she could make the earth shake.
Ready?
Now!
You don't look sick.
I guess I'm cured.
Oh, yeah.
A good start.
I love your ebony glow
I love it don't you know
Your breasts are a sin
Your body's silky skin
That hurts.
Did Nathalie like that shitty song?
Stop! It's just a song.
It's just your balls.
That hurts for real.
Never my girlfriends.
But she's really hot.
Bitch!
No, "big slut."
Excuse me?
He didn't call her a bitch, he said big slut.
He's right.
Another goof and I'll grind your balls.
Keep going!
What's his problem?
True, I'm nitpicking.
Look at me, asshole.
You're 41, and not one single.
A guitar doesn't make up for a pencil dick.
I know. She didn't quite say that.
Jotting from memory, I puff things up.
Would you shut it?
You're doing great.
Who are you?
Me?
No one, for the moment.
Listen,
I'm splitting.
Yeah, get lost.
Young man? If I may...
Goddammit!
It was a glass of wine.
Asshole!
You morons! Can't you see it's wine?
What do you see there?
The bastards! It's my own jacket.
Shit.
They could've told me.
- Relax.
- I'm not relaxing!
This sequence cost me 35 grand!
We had 3 days to rehearse 5 characters.
And the Munich Accords is tomorrow.
Fuck the Nazis!
Goddammit.
- What's she doing?
- Crushing an 800-buck earpiece.
When you yell in her ear, how can she act?
Why do I always play the dope?
Do I look like a dope?
Well...
Well, what?
It's your physique, not you.
Insult me if you like. You might feel better.
May I?
Feel free.
You're ugly.
You're dishonest, fickle, deceitful.
Talky,
hypocritical, conceited...
Cowardly.
And despicable?
Absolutely.
Musset. Her favorite monologue.
But you added ugly, which sort of skews...
Spur of the moment inspiration.
I'm just playing.
Me too.
Feel better?
Dating so many jerks is wearing me out.
You've dated many?
Yeah, I have notoriously bad judgment.
Out of bad taste?
Very bad. I find you charming, for instance.
I see. It's really bad.
Marry me.
Are you serious?
I am. This has to stop.
You're probably an asshole, but you'd be the last.
Is she improvising?
No, she has a good memory.
What do you do?
Med school, goddammit.
Send Lucie with an earpiece.
Dim the lights.
Haven't you just flunked med school?
How do you know that?
I don't know. Intuition.
I'm impressed.
Keep going.
I'd say you were born in Grenoble.
Prematurely.
Almost died. I got lucky.
And my parents?
I hated your father most. Harsh man.
He wanted you to be a surgeon.
So, prep school in Bordeaux.
- But you fell in love.
- A jerk?
And jealous.
- Mean?
- Sheer hell.
Your focus had to be on him.
- Kept me from studying?
- Constantly.
Left you for a super tall blonde.
You always say "super tall" super fast.
Since then, you wear super high heels.
You know me super well.
It feels that way.
Good! She's good.
Is that all?
No. You don't like your red hair.
In a few years, you'll dye your hair dark.
I thought it was a shame,
but it suited you, too.
How am I politically?
Weird. You just voted communist,
but you'll vote for Sarkozy.
Who?
Never mind.
And you?
Me?
I owe you everything.
Everything?
Everything. Take drawing, for instance.
With your prodding,
my hobby became my profession.
You saved me from drink.
You introduced me to books, people, cities.
Everything.
He talks a good line.
That's lovely.
I wish someone said that to me.
Now she orders hard-boiled eggs.
With sugar.
Turn up the lights.
All done, Victor?
- Dessert?
- Yes!
You'll think I'm nuts,
but do you have hardboiled eggs and sugar?
Sure.
We do.
Thank you.
I don't know why I love them.
Don't force yourself. It's an acquired taste.
I love them.
Poor thing.
Are you an actress?
Me?
You should be. You're convincing.
You said a few lines earlier...
Quite frankly...
I don't know what you mean.
Is it well paid? It can't be easy,
new lines every day.
And there's no applause.
I could applaud, if you wanted.
He's ruining the scene.
Change the subject.
Talk about his hands.
Men love that.
Compliments in general.
Stuff you never do.
We'd be together if you...
Are you joking?
Excuse me?
You must be joking.
Invite me to your table.
Enough of the jerk's beer.
By all means.
Move!
What would you like?
You have nice teeth.
- And I love your ears.
- My ears?
They're perfect. Not too big, not too small.
But those hands...
Look at those hands.
Ease up, sweetie. It's not foreplay.
Don't call me sweetie.
I didn't.
Were they always this soft?
I don't know.
A scotch, please.
No, she drank vodka.
Well, I want a scotch. Can't I?
Of course you can.
Of course you can.
"The phone rang."
The phone.
It's for you.
I'll put her on.
Marianne!
Be right back.
I hated the stranger on the phone.
I imagined men, handsomer and stronger than I.
Which wasn't difficult.
I have to go. I have a date.
The other guy?
Yes, indeed.
Where's Dad sleeping?
At a friend's.
Who?
You don't know him.
Poor guy.
My baby boy, don't be sad!
Both your parents were miserable.
Now, it's just him.
And you've always seen him moping.
You're not yourself.
I'm afraid you'll regret this.
Share my joy!
It's not you I'm leaving.
I never should have breast-fed you.
Freud warned me:
Sucking the mother's breast is the starting point
of all sex lives.
He never told me it was the end, too.
Good night, sweetie.
How's it going?
We're making progress. Trust me.
Does he seem happy?
Does he have a hard-on?
What?
Tell me he has a hard-on.
Well, I'll go check.
Talk later.
Sorry.
My brother.
Yes, that's what she told me.
Turned out it was an Italian
she slept with on Wednesdays.
You think I'm a slut?
We're in '74, it's a crazy time for you.
People change, you know.
I don't think so.
You're wrong. He's right. People change.
Shut up.
Ok.
You're resplendent.
Should we leave you?
You're sublime, Margot.
Shut up.
I could watch you perform for hours.
Sorry,
I'm going off the rails.
Is everything alright?
Yes.
Everything's fine.
But it's time to stop making the same mistakes.
Ok, I'm sorry.
My timing's bad. Keep going.
I'm sick of waiting for something gentle,
something harmonious.
Something real.
I'm tired of waiting.
What's she doing?
Sorry.
Send in the singer. Then Gisèle, right after.
Send in the singer and Gisèle right after.
To soak up her smile
Hear her laugh awhile
I'd give up the time I have left
Shedding tears
For just one caress
A sip of tenderness
I'd give up my future to you
Right now, my dear
She's a singer too?
Hey, cookie.
C'mon! We're waiting.
Gotta run.
So soon?
There we go.
Up the music.
Nice! Sweet move.
You perverted piece of shit.
You beat off on your own productions.
Miss!
You forgot this.
Thank you.
It's been lovely to meet you.
It's all fake, but enjoyable all the same.
Coming tomorrow evening? I am.
Alright.
I believe it was raining.
Nope, not the first night.
Give him what he wants.
Many thanks!
Stop the fucking rain, before I catch cold.
Are you busy afterward?
Very pretty!
And young. She could be my daughter.
It's all in the head. I've been 18 for 2 weeks.
My father.
It's a pleasure.
Likewise, young man.
See you soon, son.
See ya, Dad.
No partying, he has exams in the morning.
I promise.
All went well?
Yes.
Especially as in 5 hours he's dying
of a heart attack.
One last drink?
I won't say no.
- We'll laugh a lot.
- Yes.
We'll be cheerful.
Look at me as if I were heaven's gate.
I need my glasses.
Yes...
When asked about happiness, Friedrich Engels said,
"It's a sip of Château Margaux, 1848."
Cut it out. You know I don't like wine.
Do you have a beer?
A beer now?
I hate this painting.
I look dead, like when I lived here.
We weren't so unhappy.
Aren't you sick of all this stuff?
I hardly dared move.
It made me crave sneakers, fast food and rap.
What stopped you?
You scared me.
I pretended to read poems and like opera.
During sex, once,
I wondered how girls gave blowjobs in 1841.
I can show you. It's simple.
Sorry.
I brought tomorrow's schedule.
Thanks.
Can I be in the next sequence?
Because personally,
I found the experience truly gratifying.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Ok. Thank you.
She was shaking. Do you screw her?
No.
You screw her.
And those two?
You screw them all once. It's like an OCD.
Revenge for your nerdy years:
yellow teeth and zits.
What are you doing? Leaving?
Say, your limp, do you play it up?
Good night.
Shut the door behind you.
It's so 19th century. Lord Byron at the Lido.
Bozo.
Stupid cow!
Shit.
You're snoring.
What about it?
Well, stop.
Mr. Drumond, excuse me.
We need your suit back.
Why on earth?
Your stay with us ended this morning.
But I have a date tonight.
Ok, how much for a few extra nights?
I have to work it out.
Off the top of my head...
2 nights would be about...
What's that? Euros? That's outrageous.
Fine! You know what?
Fine!
Mr. Drumond, your suit?
It's mine! The most expensive suit I've ever worn.
I'm staying.
Where's he going to find the money?
Don't you worry.
Start rehearsing?
Go ahead.
Who's the clown?
My dad.
See? You're everywhere.
Don't you want to read it?
Meet the team?
No need, I'm sure they're all great.
I'm so pleased. I always hoped we'd work together.
Actually, me too. Really. After all.
But I have a favor to ask.
We're gonna work with that dude?
He has a look of his own.
- That's no small sum.
- Knock it off my pay.
Sure, but still...
Don't make me beg.
I gave you allowance till you were 25.
It's like paying me back for all the vacations.
Alright.
Looking at it that way.
He's writing a check?
How are things with Mom? Ok?
Never better.
I'm rediscovering her.
Welcome.
You'll wipe me out.
Don't you think it's worth it?
I hope it is.
Catch you later.
Can I see the petal rain?
I need weed everywhere. Even in the back.
It's a weed rug.
Try it with lights out.
Not bad.
Works pretty well after all.
What'll it be?
I'm waiting for someone.
Yesterday's doll?
How old, would you say?
I say beauty is ageless.
Besides, you're a kid.
Do you love him or what?
We go way back.
I was 13 or 14.
Lived in a dump, was a dunce.
My dad always called me a dimwit.
I was 5 feet tall with zits.
You too? I feel better.
One morning, I found out the only girl who liked me
had dropped me for a boy named Jérôme Corcelet.
Jérôme Corcelet.
Piece of shit.
I opened the window,
I peered down into the void,
and I did a really stupid thing.
I lost it.
So your leg...
No, we lived on the 1st floor.
I broke my wrist.
A few months later, I met his son.
We became friends.
He invited me on vacation. His parents were there.
The opposite of mine.
They were funny, smart.
They seemed so in love.
I'd never seen anyone like them.
One evening, he gave me this book he'd illustrated.
I reread it every year.
And your leg?
Ski accident at Valmorel. Broke his leg.
They pinned it, but he went running...
Where the hell is she?
How should I know?
I have to swing by a party.
Come with us?
It's around the block.
Let's go.
Move!
Here.
No, thank you very much.
Never mind.
I'll take it.
You shouldn't mix alcohol and...
Alcohol and what?
Is he the hunk?
Nice to meet you, Gisèle.
I remember Gisèle!
Gisèle the wild child.
It's good to see you again. I really liked Gisèle.
Good thing the night is young.
Cool it, girl.
Gimme a sec, I have to unburden myself.
- Sorry about that.
- Not your fault.
I remember she was hypersensitive.
Drinking eased her shyness.
Ready for a drink?
I like her better shy.
To think she became advisor
to the Interior Ministry.
It was as if the grass
was growing under me
like a vast forest of delights.
Some people, I swear.
I feel like I'm in jail.
Is that real weed on the floor?
It's a mix of hemp and weed buds.
It's his doing. Everything has to feel real.
I hired 5 dealers.
Do we get leftovers?
Yes, of course. In your dreams.
What's fantastic with parallel markets
is the revival of the communal spirit of the '70s.
People share, mix and mingle
with no socio-cultural boundaries.
It's what I call e-conviviality.
How's Victor?
He's sorry he couldn't come.
He's working with our son on a series.
Ah, for which platform?
StarNet.
What if he has a bad trip and sues you?
Look at his eyes.
He doesn't look litigious to me.
You danced well.
What?
I loved watching you dance.
Sweetheart, easy on the beer.
Screw you.
His wife wasn't a stripper when they met.
Wasn't she?
Drop the roses.
No, no roses.
Damn you...
- She's gorgeous.
- Totally.
Yeah, super gorgeous.
What's the matter with you?
Have you tried coffee enema?
A coffee enema?
I read on Gwyneth Paltrow's blog
that introducing one grain of coffee
detoxes the colon.
Interesting.
Marianne?
Sorry.
- Are you ok?
- Everything's fine.
No, you're boring, but it's fine.
What did you say?
You're total bores.
You have to admit you're depressing tonight.
Diane, admit it.
Did my husband pay you
to be so dull tonight?
Were he here, we'd badmouth you all the way home.
I'll be going, right? I should.
I'll take this.
Because it tastes good.
Very good.
Should we call you a cab?
I left Victor.
I haven't heard from him since.
I don't even know how he's doing.
That's life.
Love your hair. Is it real?
'Course it's real.
Everything is real.
But what happened to all the people like you?
Where'd they put you?
Have you seen my wife?
Who?
I need some air.
- He oughta lay off weed.
- I like him stoned.
Sorry!
Join us.
Maybe later.
I love my job.
Let's get moving.
Orgy people, you're done.
Am I disturbing you?
Not at all.
But everything's spinning.
Their weed rug is strong!
Yeah.
Actually, the trick is never to close your eyes.
Breathe.
Hard.
Harder.
I think it's worse.
Yeah, it is!
Look at me.
Her perfume.
I loved that one. With bergamot.
I miss you.
Do you?
Why's she kissing him?
It's here, "We kissed with sudden conviction."
No, we agreed to skip that.
What are you doing?
I'm an old man.
Me too.
I'm an old man.
You're going too far. It reeks of revenge.
Fair enough.
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.
I'm going to talk to her.
- Why's she kissing him?
- Easy, tiger!
Stop everything.
Let her improvise. Trust her.
Improvise what?
A blow-job? A doggie fuck?
Cut it out. Give her space.
It's water. Fuck!
Is everything phony?
This is phony.
That's phony.
That's phony. Everything!
I'm phony!
Maybe.
Please, you must have a name.
- I don't!
- You must...
A shortcut.
At least, I hope so.
Leading to Set E.
I am under the impression
that discussions are encouraging.
Gentlemen, I don't know if you can see,
but I'm starving.
I am very curious to know
what the cook has prepared for us.
- You ok?
- Yes.
Careful.
Excuse us, gentlemen.
There's a scene going on.
Two seconds.
I don't believe it!
The wackos!
Who are you?
Excuse me, sir...
Come on!
Sorry!
Still here?
We're chatting.
Can I join you?
No.
It's steep.
Go on in. I'll be right there.
Everything ok?
Say, isn't this young...
Yeah.
He hasn't changed much.
You live on the set?
No, it's temporary.
I'll make ginger tea.
That'll fix you up.
- And you must be hungry.
- I could eat a horse.
My father's name is Piotrowska.
My parents are Polish.
And my name is Camille Piotrowska.
Did you have the accent?
No, I'm kidding.
I was one and a half when we arrived.
I have a passion for Poland.
You do?
So, tell me, Victor,
where have you been in Poland?
I lived near Warsaw in a little town: Dobre.
Yes, Dobre. I know it well.
I set a comic in 1920s Dobre.
I'd love to read it.
Me too. I can't find it.
Say that again.
Did you always want to act?
No, I started playing piano.
In Poland, you play Chopin before you walk.
So you play well?
And I stopped. For lack of talent.
Said who?
Me.
Play some more. It's nice.
You have to go home.
I can't stay?
No. Look at your drawings.
They sleep together on the 4th night.
But I'm talking to you right now.
You're not allowed to.
I could lose my job.
I need the work.
When do I see you again?
In 1974.
Mr. Drumond?
Put this in your ear.
Hello, Victor.
I hope you can hear me.
I just wanted to tell you that...
it was a joy for me to see you smile tonight.
You seem to be feeling better.
That means the world to me.
A long time ago, you helped me out.
I'd lost all faith in life.
And you told me,
"Be curious.
"Develop your imagination."
I followed your advice.
I didn't find happiness,
but it could've been worse.
It's my turn to say it.
Keep being creative.
I don't know what the future holds for you,
but live it to the fullest.
I sound like a fucking song.
Hi.
Hiya.
Sorry, I'm just picking up a few things.
No problem.
- How are you?
- Very well. You?
You've shaved. It suits you.
You think so?
Wait.
Stay for a coffee.
No, thanks. I have to go to the office.
Ok.
- Say?
- Yes?
Ever hear from Gisèle?
Who?
Your friend Gisèle.
- My Gisèle?
- You should call her.
She's sweet.
Everyone, this is Victor, my dad.
He'll be working with us.
This is Paul, Stéphane, Louise.
I'm just 10. I know I'm not really,
but I'm just 10
Lemme daydream, I'm just 10
It's been 15 years since I was just 10
It sounds like baloney. If you think I'm lyin'
If you think I'm lyin'
At recess you'll be cryin'
I'm just 10
I'm in grade school.
And I learn
To play by the rules.
Not my concern
I'm nobody's fool.
I watch kites turn
And dream I'm cool
If you think I'm lyin'
At recess you'll be cryin'
At the weekend I parade
A straw in my lemonade
I bug the vanilla cookie girls
And the chocolate chip guys...
My wife and I own a small apartment near Biarritz
and we've decided to sell.
Just to be sure: Your wife agrees?
Yes, my wife always agrees with me.
Lucky man you are.
I'm just 10.
Got marbles in my pocket
I'm just 10.
Girls are idiotic
I'm just 10.
Lemme daydream, I'm just 10...
- What's that?
- Nothing. Don't pay attention.
High up in my tree-house hideout
I'm the king of blowpipe stakeouts
I shoot wads of gum to the four winds...
Come on in.
Could you burst out laughing?
A more annoying laugh?
Great.
Now eye my colleague lustfully.
Ok! Thank you.
- Again.
- Stop it.
Sorry, I'm late.
Who are you?
I'm Marianne, sugar.
No, you're not. There's some kind of mistake.
I don't know what to do.
Me neither, frankly...
Where is she?
I don't know, sir.
I was asked to learn a role...
What's going on?
PRIVATE
I spent a fortune.
You have no idea what I did to raise that money.
Tell me where she is.
I can't. Actors have private lives.
When will she be back?
She won't. All I know is she left the project.
Alright, thank you.
What are you doing here?
Why, I'm working, sir.
Should we do your room?
But you're...
Sorry?
They asked me to replace...
- You're an actor?
- That's a big word.
But your "father" story?
It's all part of it.
Fake clients win your trust.
What?
Mr. Drumond, then, should we keep your keys?
Stop it or I'll shove 'em down your throat.
I do as I'm told. I'm making a living.
- Where is she?
- Who?
- The girl.
- Let go, dammit.
Where?
I'll tell you if you let go!
Very well.
I'll give you
the address of a good barber
over in...
Levallois.
There.
I'm looking for Camille Piotrowska.
Who?
It's ok, Mom. It's for me.
Why are you here?
I have to talk to you.
You shouldn't be here.
Mommy, I got a booboo!
Another one?
Come in.
Hello.
Come in.
It's a mess. We had a birthday party yesterday.
Darling, this is Victor, my current co-actor.
I see. Nice to meet you.
The '70s, right?
- Have a seat.
- I'll be right back.
What's your role in the sequence?
He's my father.
Ok, yeah, I can see it.
Care for a glass of wine?
Sylvie, can you bring glasses?
Would you mind?
You never had kids.
I did, but a long time ago.
I can't do it, Antoine.
Why not? You're an actress.
This is...
This is what?
The look in his eyes.
I see his eyes.
Did you do him?
Stop it.
What?
Zoom out the living room.
What's your name?
Klaus Barbie.
That's a pretty name.
Klaus Barbie!
What is all this?
My life. You knew I was an actress.
What about the brunette?
Poland, the piano?
I think you wrote that a while back.
I have it somewhere. Right here.
The Warsaw Violinist.
I improvised around it.
I play roles. It's not always easy.
Very good.
Mommy!
Sylvie.
Take off your coat, make yourself comfortable.
Could you hold it?
Not if I can help it.
Flirt now, Josiane.
What's the matter?
Labrador eyes.
Your face seems familiar.
Touch him, go ahead.
Haven't we met before?
I don't think so.
Mom, please.
What?
I'll get it.
You're perverse.
I'm perverse?
You hit on your wife through someone else,
pay extras...
You asked for a love story!
But not to get jilted after.
Who does?
Am I disturbing you?
No, we're rehearsing.
Nice blockhead. Good choice.
I'll take her, she's getting you dirty.
Even the baby's good.
Besides, jilted when?
What does that mean?
You don't even know who I am.
Music.
I'm scraps of sketches.
Of lines.
Scraps of a woman you love.
Scraps of a woman you love.
Because I think you love her.
Although you're running from her.
She's changed but so have you.
Instead of revisiting memories,
find what makes her beautiful,
sad, surprising,
here and now.
We can't rewrite
how we want people to be forever.
You can't direct everything.
You have to accept to be disappointed,
criticized,
predictable, less amazing or whatever.
Or you always start over.
Why's she crying?
I didn't ask her to cry.
Some trials work,
but you miss out on your real life.
That's incredible.
It's totally convincing.
I'm sorry if I hurt you, Dad.
I really am.
Less than I am, kiddo.
I'll be going.
Did I say something wrong?
No, Victor's tired.
We worked late last night.
I fell in love with you.
For real.
What's he saying?
Nothing. We're rehearsing.
Goodbye.
Bye, see you soon!
She's never been this good. It's fishy.
No, it's not.
Is he gone? My ear thing is itching.
Whose baby is this?
Would you mind shutting up?
This sequence was rough.
Did you do him?
Did you?
You did, didn't you?
You're going too far.
If he kills himself, don't tell me.
Cut it out! Everything's fine.
He'll go home to his wife.
He’ll look at her
like a shipwrecked sailor spotting land.
He'll take her in his arms,
get on his knees and beg her.
How would you know? Are you God?
I'm a screenwriter.
Holding a baby suits you.
I was eager to see it.
Music.
You psychopath.
Hold her a sec.
No, c'mon. Gimme a break.
Where are your fucking cameras?
Where? There?
See me?
Can you?
500-buck mirror.
Margot!
Wait!
- I'll stop.
- I can't anymore.
- I know.
- I can't!
I'll stop.
I swear, I'll stop.
I swear.
I'm done.
I'll stop.
I love you.
Morning, sweetie.
Sit, I boiled some eggs.
With sugar.
I have an unbelievable story to tell you,
very complicated.
Not too strong, right?
I went back to the '70s.
I wanted to meet you.
I mean, meet you again.
When you liked me.
Or when I was likeable.
Anyway.
I meet the actress playing you.
She looks nothing like you,
but it's your hair, your words...
Redhead but younger.
Naturally.
After a few days,
the girl becomes a dark-haired pianist.
Not to imitate you.
A real brunette, born that way.
It happens.
Then nope, she's blonde.
She has kids, a house. The works.
But I didn't know that.
I was naive enough to think maybe she loved me.
Some men like old women.
No again, it was all fake.
So I'm ruined. For nothing.
By the way, I had to sell Biarritz.
- You did what?
- I sold it.
You've gone mad.
No, I've gone broke.
Those PJs suit you.
They're yours.
I know.
Want a hit?
Yes.
The good news is I'm drawing again.
Is that so?
Here.
François, if you don't mind,
I still need your pad.
Of course.
Thanks, you're a true friend.
Yeah, well...
Victor!
Why don't you go shave?
Today again, yellow vests demonstrated
throughout the country.
Hello?
Gisèle?
We haven't fought in 2 weeks.
Oh yeah?
I haven't left you. You haven't left me.
What does this mean?
I don't know. That we're on vacation?
I like vacations.
I hadn't taken any in a long time.
Did you sleep with him?
Looks like vacation's over.
What does it bring to mind?
It's complicated.
Everything's complicated.
The goal isn't to simplify,
it's to accept complexity.
Jeez, you're annoying!
Are you nuts?
Why'd you do that? What's with you?
Dad.
Here you go.
Thanks, Lucie.
You're welcome.
Lucie, c'mere.
What?
- When's quitting time?
- Why?
Because I love you.
I wrote you a song.
Cut the crap.
I swear.
It's called "The Golden-Eyed Waitress."
Hey, doll!
Doll?
Don't you remember him?
No. Should I?
No.
Now I do...
I remember.
Oh my God!
Sometimes oblivion is bliss.
You were a singer, right?
I have my moments.
I missed you, muffin.
There!
You bitch!
- It's coming back to you!
- I loved that part.
Here.
Not that!
What a dope.
Shit, I've had it!
I really have.
I'm splitting.
Good idea.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
So this is where you spend your time?
I don't regret those days.
We weren't so free.
Rapists went unpunished,
getting an abortion was a nightmare.
And I felt like I was living
in a giant ashtray.
You can put out your smokes!
Finally!
You could have chosen
our vacation in Normandy.
Our weekend in Berlin.
True, there were other great dates.
What is it we said that evening?
I know.
You're dishonest,
fickle,
deceitful,
talky, hypocritical,
conceited, cowardly,
despicable...
Etc. but...
would you marry me?
No.
Why not?
In 25 years, you won't stand me.
25 years is no small feat.
And I disagree.
It's me I can't stand.
Drinks?
A vodka, please.
Two.
Three.
Come here.
Can he have your seat?
Sit.
Take the headphones.
- You ok?
- Yeah.
You looked good dressed like that.
You should wear ties even now.
It wouldn't change much.
Little details are a big deal
when you've known someone 40 years.
What do you do?
Everything's ahead of me, sir.
Children, a marriage, a career.
Everything.
I have to make the most of it because later...
I'll go crazy.
You'll go crazy?
One day, yes.
One day, I'll wake up...
my son will be an old bore,
my profession will have become routine,
my husband will be depressed,
and I'll go berserk.
Will you regret it?
Yes.
Very much so.
Here you are.
Thanks.
I looked at your drawings.
And?
Unbearable.
I love them.
I hadn't been so jealous in a super long time.
What a dreadful emotion. It feels good.
I feel like I'm 12 years old.
I could do her violent harm.
I miss you.
Me?
Yes.
I hardly know you, but I miss you already.
Why?
That's life.
I like your hands.
That bimbo's right.
They're soft.
Up the lights.
Pierre?
Let me introduce my wife.
Pleased to meet you.
Good evening.
So it's you?
Yes, the old-age version.
Don't say that, you're superb.
Who are you playing tonight?
No one. I wanted a Suze. I'm off today.
Can I ask you something?
Yes, of course.
How's your father? The real one.
My father?
He passed away a few years ago.
I loved him dearly and playing this part
a few nights did me good.
I felt completely in character.
It's a curious profession.
I imagine so.
Good evening, miss.
Good evening.
He's right. You're superb.
If they make love, will you watch?
Phone.
I'll put her on.
- Marianne!
- I'm not here.
You're wearing the perfume?
- Yes.
- Aren't you?
To soak up her smile
Hear her laugh awhile
I would give the time I have left
Shedding tears
For just one caress
A sip of tenderness
I'd give up my future to you
Right now, my dear
To taste her tender gaze
Feel her body ablaze...
Hey, cookie, c'mon.
We're waiting.
Oh, that's right.
- Gotta run.
- So soon?
Will you call me?
Alright.
- When?
- Soon.
The sooner the better.
Life is short, you know.
- Yvon?
- Yeah, bud.
Check, please.
Coming up.
Cut. It's all wrong.
You, ok. Move over.
Gimme.
Back there, you look like you're at a funeral.
And you,
stop giggling like the scene's funny.
And do something with your arms.
Show me how you'll kiss the client.
Show me.
Wait, show me again.
That wasn't bad.
What?
Get to work!
Let's do it!
