According to science,
the fluttering of...
...a little butterfly's wings
gives rise to a storm.
When a leaf falls on earth,
it affects the stars.
A slight wave gives
rise to a tsunami.
In the same way,
a storm and a disaster...
...move towards us slowly,
and by the time we realise,
it's a little too late.
Who... who's there?
You need not remove your shoes,
Mr. Cooper.
God doesn't reside here anymore.
We killed God!
Don't you remember?
Veer is back.
There's going to be a disaster.
Oh, my God!
I'll kill everyone.
Everyone.
No one can do anything to me.
No one can do anything to me.
Because... I've attained salvation.
Did you hear?!
I'm attaining salvation!
I've attained salvation!
I've attained salvation.
Baby, you look simply the best!
Just... just superb!
I'm so happy
you've decided to work again.
Just wait and watch. You'll be
at the top of your profession...
...and nobody will be
able to stop you.
Anyway, get ready quickly.
We have to attend
the sponsors party.
Meet people...
...make new friends.
I don't feel like going.
Oh my God, Nutty!
Stop making excuses, okay?
I'm not going to listen to anything.
I'll just see you there, okay?
Hello! Hello?
Hey, it's me.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
Don't lie.
Yash, I've got to perform at a show.
I have to leave.
Don't worry.
I won't take much of your time.
There's an award function...
...at the Taj today.
My programme
has been nominated.
I've called to invite you for it.
That's it.
I have to go for a party
after the show.
I know you're busy,
but I'd really love to
see you there.
But if you can't,
I'll understand.
You take care. Bye.
What was Yash saying?
Nothing. He just wanted to
invite me for a party.
And you're surely going,
aren't you?
Caron, it's not like that.
Nutty, please try and understand.
I have no objection to your
relationship with Yash.
I know you really love him.
But is it necessary for us
to be tied up...
...in one relationship or the other
all our lives?
I know what Yash thinks
about your work.
Whenever you've gone back to him...
...you've completely ignored
yourself and your work.
Nutty, you know how important
it is to have...
...your own identity today.
You've overcome all this
with great difficulty.
I suggest, please don't go back.
But I'm not going back to him.
We were good friends too.
You were good friends!
I've heard that one.
Anyway, if you really want to
go for his party...
...then by all means, please go.
But remember, if you go back today...
...then everything will
get sorted out...
...with your lover boy once again.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
I promise.
We're fooling ourselves with
all the dupery going on...
...in this country
in the name of God.
We're still where we were,
thousands of years ago.
We're still obsessed
with superstitious beliefs.
Some say that statues have
started drinking milk.
Sometimes salty water turns sweet.
A monkey starts praying
at a temple...
Etc.
I mean, we fail to realize...
...that it's only when our
thinking progresses...
...that India can progress.
If our dream is to become
economically powerful...
...we'll have to first
fight superstition.
Remember, the brains to make
an atom bomb is very dangerous...
Ladies and gentlemen, the award
for the best reality show...
...goes to Yash Dayal...
...for Andhvishwas
(Superstition).
Thank you.
The fact is, the TRP's of fictional
programs and daily soaps...
...are the highest in this country.
The success of Andhvishwas...
- ...really encourages me
and my team. - Wow!
So guys, please give
a huge round of applause...
...to the entire team of
Andhvishwas.
You guys rock!
Prahlad, thank you so much
for keeping Andhvishwas on air...
...for 200 long episodes.
Vishal, you too.
And yes, of course, mom and dad,
I love you guys.
Our sponsors, Zee News, my crew,
my staff, everybody.
But most of all,
I'd like to thank the person...
...because of whom I'm here today.
If it wasn't for her...
...I'd have been an ordinary reporter
with an ordinary news channel.
I owe my success to her.
Nandita, my love.
You've done a lot for me in life.
Whatever I am today,
is just because of you.
You deserve this award
as much as I do.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
# You're going to be by my side. #
Yes! We've done it!
I love you!
# I love you! #
# Darling! Oh, my darling! #

all I think of is... #

all my sorrows will vanish. #

I've been waiting here for
so long. Where are you?
I've got a surprise for you.

I can't wait no longer. #

I am in love. #
# Come into my life.
Let's grow old together. #
# Be with me, hold my hand,
no matter what happens. #
You can leave the key. The house
is not going to run away, baby.
Yash, for so many years,
I was yearning...
...for a house that
I could call my own.
I can't believe this.
This house is very expensive,
isn't it?
Can we afford it?
- Yes. You had told me to sell
the truth... - Yes, I know.
Sell the truth and
buy your dreams.
Everyone does it.
What's the big deal
if we did it too?
Yash, I want this house
at any cost.
It's all yours, baby.
It's all yours.
# Come and be my guiding light. #
- Yash, I'm shopping so you...
- Cool.
Just shut up, okay?
Try to understand.
Security will chuck us
out in no time.
I have a 6 a.m. flight
to catch, baby.
- Why don't you understand?
- Fine! Go away.
And... it's fitting you.
I'm buying it, okay?
- Bye.
- I'll see you at the party.
My... My wallet?!
Listen, Nandita...
Hello! Yash, I am in the car park.
Hello! This thing...
Yash? Hello!
Hey, security. Hello!
Excuse me.
Hello, Yash.
Can you hear me?
Yash? Hello!
Hello.
Yash?
Yash...
Is that you?
Who's there?
Yash, is that you?
I've been trying to call you.
What happened?
A man at the mall
was staring at me...
...in a very unusual manner.
Must be a fan, baby. Forget it.
I'm going to crash.
Got a flight at six in the morning.
So, what does it say?
Positive.
I just can't believe you, Nandita.
I mean, you can be so careless!
First, you go back to that man...
...and then come back pregnant!
Do you know
how stupid you are?
# Hare Rama! Hare Krishna! #
# Hare Rama... #
Dear, keep the Gita with you,
if you want to ward the evil away.
It will always protect you.
Driver, let's go.
Scared you!
I have a bad habit of
shocking people.
Do I know you?
No.
But, perhaps, I know you.
- Is that why you're stalking me?
- Yes.
For the past few days, in fact.
For the first time in my life...
...I took the trouble
to stalk someone.
It's very costly,
you know.
What am I doing?
Why am I doing it?
I don't ask myself such questions.
Give me just two minutes.
I'll explain everything.
- Just two minutes.
- What are you doing?
My name is Prithvi.
I'm an artist.
All artists live to create
one exceptional work of art...
...during their lifetime.
Their master piece.
I've tried very hard.
I alienated myself from the world,
and painted this.
This.
But I didn't commission anyone
to paint a portrait of me.
One night, all of a sudden,
a picture came to my mind.
And that was it.
My master piece.
I had made it four months ago.
At that time, I didn't even know
there was someone with such a face.
Last night,
I made this new painting.
I see an impending disaster
in your future.
Do you believe in ghosts?
What happened, ma'am?
Have you gone crazy?
Were you trying to break
open the door?
The key got stuck
in the lock, ma'am.
Couldn't you just ring the bell?
I forgot my bag in the kitchen.
Hello.
Hello, Yash?
- Nandita...
- I need to talk to you.
- Yash! - I can't hear you!
Hello! Your voice is cracking.
Can you hear me now?
Hello!
Hello!
What the hell!
Stop the car!
What's happening?
They are Aghoris (cannibals).
Let's leave this
place please, boss.
- We shouldn't stay here.
Let's go from here. - You leave.
Let me see what's happening.
Tonight is a full-moon night.
They worship ghosts
to save themselves.
What're you saying?
What's that foreigner doing here?
Go and fetch my camera.
Let's capture this. Come on.
Boss, I think it's better
to not get involved.
Even the Tantrics
are scared of them.
Oh, what the hell...
This has international appeal.
Go and fetch the camera. Go.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is 21 st-century India.
While on one hand, it dreams big...
...about making big leaps
towards globalisation...
On the other, it has
still not managed...
...to rid itself of archaic
beliefs and rituals.
Let's show you some proof.
Tonight is a full-moon night.
It's a night when ghosts
and spirits...
...descend upon earth
with all their might.
It's a night when Tantrics
and Aghoris...
...devote themselves to the worship
of immortality...
...Tantric knowledge and
supernatural powers.
They make themselves wiser
and more powerful.
At least that's what the
people say, not us.
It's also believed that the
weak-minded, the weak-hearted...
...and the superstitious,
can easily be possessed by ghosts.
Don't be surprised.
You may be a victim of
these superstitions as well.
Now, it's for you to decide. Are we
ever going to move forward in life...
...or run backwards, like always?
Along with cameraman
Vishal Gor...
...Yash Dayal, Zee News.
Help! Help!
Help!
- Start adrenaline now.
- Yes, doctor.
Cotton...
Get the crash cart now!
Mr. Dayal, I'm Dr. Murli.
You don't need to worry now.
She's doing much better.
We'll have to keep her
under observation until evening.
Since she lost a lot of blood...
I'm sorry, but we couldn't
save the child.
Child?
So, what did you see?
I felt as if...
someone was drowning.
How many drinks
did you have that day?
- I...
- Excuse me.
Hello. I'll talk to you
in the evening, okay?
Yash... The baby...
Why did you do this?
You were pregnant
and you didn't even tell me.
Yash, you were busy working.
I didn't want to disturb you.
Stop this nonsense! You have
no right to bother me like this.
What do you want to prove
by hurting yourself?
Yash, you think I have done this?
- What are you saying?
- The doctors say so.
Yash, you know how much
I love myself.
Why would I ever do
such a thing?
Really? Then who did it?
If not you, then who?
Yash, I know that man
has done all this.
He was following me that night.
Yash, try and understand.
He even followed me inside the lift!
He started showing
his paintings to me.
There were my portraits!
There was one in which...
...my wrist was slit
with blood oozing...
...just like this.
Yash, I'm telling you.
It's him. Please trust me.
It's him. You have to
believe me, Yash.
He used to work in an
ad agency in Chennai.
He's an artist by profession.
His father was in the military.
I've inquired. He has
no criminal record.
Believe me, he's clean.
You'll have to arrest him.
Yash, he has saved Nandita's life.
He fought with the security guard...
...broke into your house...
...and rescued Nandita in time.
He called for the ambulance.
Honestly, you must thank this man.
Hi, I'm Yash.
Nice to meet you.
But I'm very sad to
meet you, Mr. Dayal.
I'm sorry?
You should be. God has given you
such a beautiful girlfriend...
...and you couldn't even protect her.
And then there's me, who doesn't let
anyone close to her paintings even.
I'm sure you must've been helpless.
You take care of her next
time. Do you hear?
I'll keep that in mind.
But tell me something.
Why were you following Nandita?
And how did you know that she
was going to commit suicide?
I mean, the watchman was
inside the building...
...and he didn't hear her voice.
But you were outside
and you heard it.
It's very, very strange,
Mr. Prithvi. Isn't it?
Strange. Quite strange.
Even I was thinking the same.
But I know why this is happening.
Why I heard her yell, when
your watchman didn't...
Why I followed her and why
you're troubling me...
I don't ask myself
so many questions.
Actually, I hope I was clueless.
Confused? I'm used to it.
I hope we don't meet again.
Goodbye.
For you.
Scoundrel!
Come, sir.
It stinks in here.
I wonder what's going on, sir.
Sir has already called thrice.
All the cases should be solved...
...before the fair begins.
Sir, he was saying...
...that they are pressurised
by their seniors.
Many international tourists
flock this place.
If they find out, they
will never come back.
Neighbors say that he has not come
out of the house since four days.
He wasn't meeting anyone.
In all the suicide cases...
...it is written something
like this behind the wall.
He says... he will kill me.
They heard some gun shots,
and then... this.
Have a look at this.
Sir. Blood, sir.
Go to sleep, baby.
It's too late.
# In the solitude of the night...
In the shadows of the day... #
#...a face haunts my mind. #
# There's someones fragrance
in every breath I take. #
# What's this secret? #
# Why is it not being revealed? #
# - Pray tell me, why are you on my
mind, stranger? - Stranger... #
What's he doing here?
Why is he looking here?
Go and take a look.
# Some questions... #
#...don't have answers. #
# You're on my mind... #
#...but do I really know you? #
# Why has the weather
suddenly changed? #
# There's neither sunshine,
nor shade. #
# What's this secret? #
# Why is it not being revealed? #
# - Pray tell me, why are you on
my mind, stranger? - Stranger... #
I can hear your heart beat till
here. It's just a ramp show!
Come on, now. Look at me.
The great sage is here.
If you perform before him...
...all your sins will be
washed away...
...and everyone will be
entertained as well.
Come on.
# I wonder what's hidden
in the stars. #
# I'm losing control
over my thoughts. #
# Everything's slowly starting
to wither away. #
# An eerie silence engulfs
the river bank. #
# It is like a knock on the door. #
# Why do I hear someone's
footsteps all the time? #
# What's this secret? #
# Why is it not being revealed? #
# - Pray tell me, why are you on
my mind, stranger? - Stranger... #
# What's this secret? #
# Stranger... #
# Stranger... #
You're in big trouble.
Do you understand?
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to welcome Mr. Anand Dev.
What do you think you're doing?
He is with us today.
Although he doesn't
require an introduction...
Nutty!
...I'd still like to tell
you about his body of work.
After which,
you'll begin to wonder...
...if he's a human being or God...
...in a human incarnation.
I'll just get someone, okay?
He has opened free schools
and hospitals...
...in many villages and
other backward areas.
He summoned specialists
from America...
...to cure life-threatening diseases
like AIDS and cancer.
They are all his devotees.
We are all fortunate...
...that the great sage has
come here to bless us.
So, ladies and gentlemen,
a huge round of applause...
...for the great sage,
Mr. Anand Dev!
You think you're God's devotee?
For how long are you going
to run this business?
Excuse me?
You're impure! You're rotten!
You don't have anything...
...other than impurity in you.
You commit sins in
the name of good deeds.
You're a fraud!
You're impure!
You are impure!
You are a wolf!
You are a pimp!
You are a murderer.
You eat others and
satisfy your hunger.
What the hell do you
think of yourself!
I won't spare you!
What the hell do
you think of yourself!
You're impure!
I won't spare you!
You are a sinner!
A spirit has possessed that girl.
That spirit abused me.
It's not that girls fault.
She's helpless.
She doesn't need a doctor.
She needs God.
Only He can cure her.
I can only pray for her.
May God free her soul.
God bless!
I've received a lot of messages...
...from our sponsors.
You know, everyone's laughing at us.
They say that while Yash
sermons on anti-superstition...
...his girlfriend is possessed
by a spirit.
- Prahlad. - Please. Don't be
emotional, okay? This is business.
I can't see the shows credibility
going down the drain.
I've dedicated...
...the five most important
years of my life to it.
I just can't lie back and accept it.
Forget this girl.
- Yash, why don't you understand?
- Prahlad...
For God's sake, please!
You know I can't do that.
- No... - Why don't
you just forget her?
Prahlad, listen to me.
Just try and understand.
Listen, once she's cured,
I'll bring her before the media...
...and everything will be cleared.
I'll tell the media that
this problem is medical.
Just give me one opportunity.
Listen, I understand.
You try and understand me.
A guy from the 21 st-century, is
reading the Bhagvad Gita?!
People visit temples to see God.
They keep His photo in their bags.
They hang His photo in their cars.
But no one keeps
Him in their hearts.
What's the matter, Mr. Paranjpe?
You look disturbed.
I like to trouble people.
This Bhagvad Gita belonged
to my father, sir.
You seem to be very stubborn.
You're right, sir. That's
why I'm an artist...
...and not a police officer.
As you can see, sage Anand
Dev's devotees...
...have collected outside
the studio...
...and are harassing
Nandita Chopra...
...who had assaulted the
sage at a Fashion show.
What would you like to
say about what happened?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have done what I did.
Why did you do that? What
do you have to say?
We've heard that you suffer
from a mental disorder...
...and that you're undergoing
treatment. Is this true?
Yes, it's true.
People say that you're
possessed by a spirit.
So would it be safe to assume...
...that you too are superstitious
and believe in ghosts and spirits?
No, I'm just not well.
Thanks a lot for
coming on our show.
That was Nandita Chopra.
You are impure.
No!
No!
- Yash, she...
- What happened?
- She...
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
I'd gone to take the medicines
and I slipped.
God! You scared me.
You know a lot about me, don't you?
Prithvi, just like Yash,
I never believed in ghosts.
I don't know why...
...but I guess because of
what I'm going through...
...I've been forced to think
about these things.
And trust me.
I don't understand it.
I have nothing to do
with any of your problems.
Just leave, please.
How can you have nothing
to do with it?
You were there whenever
anything bad happened to me.
You have got something
to do with it, Prithvi.
Have mercy.
Please tell me if there's
anything you know.
Prithvi, please help me.
You're impure.
You're rotten.
I'm sure you must've
heard these words.
Do you know this man?
- Him?
- Who are they?
He is Madhav Sharan.
There's a small city
Kalandi in Himachal...
...where a fair is held
every five years.
He was the high priest there.
His name is David Cooper.
There's a USC plant not
far away from Kalandi.
He was on the board
of directors there.
There are few others like them.
Now you need to find out...
...what connection you
had with these people.
But I don't understand...
Both of them committed suicide.
They kept saying the same thing
before they died.
Their family members believe
that they were experiencing...
...something similar
to what you're going through.
Scary noises in the first week.
The smell of something burning.
They had started fearing
their own face.
They kept saying,
you're impure...
...you're rotten.
And what not!
And finally they slit their hands...
...and wrote that on a
wall with their blood.
And then, they used the same weapon
to slit their throats.
You're destined to meet their fate.
On the day of the fashion show,
you had uttered the same words.
Do you want to know what's
my connection with all of this?
Look at them!
I drew these painting and sketches...
...in my right mind and senses.
I painted this in your house.
You were screaming at
the fashion show!
I've tried hard to stop
this from happening.
But the truth is, that
no one can stop it.
Neither I, nor anyone else.
And the way these paintings
came true...
...this also can come true.
Take a look!
I've decided it's better
if I stay out of this.
Just get out now.
Am I going to meet the
same fate as them?
Am I going to die tonight?
They kept repeating the same thing,
you're impure...
...you're rotten and what not!
And finally they slit their hands...
...and wrote the same on
a wall with their blood.
And then, they used the same
weapon to slit their throats.
But the truth is, that
no one can stop it.
Neither I, nor anyone else.
Nutty, Yash has been
trying to reach you.
Why aren't you answering?
He's on the line.
Speak to him.
Hello, Yash.
Where are you?
Hi baby, I'm sorry I can't
make it tonight.
Something urgent has come up...
...and I don't think
I can ignore it.
Yash, you promised me.
Baby, try and understand.
I know I did, but...
Yash, don't do this please.
I need you.
I'm very scared too.
# I'll be by your side always. #

Happy new year!
This is what you wanted, right?
You, me, our home.
A happy married life?
Will you marry me?
Nandita, stop!
Nandita!
Nandita!
You're impure. You're rotten.
You're impure. You're rotten.
You're impure. You're rotten.
You're impure.
Nandita...
You're impure. You're rotten.
You're impure. You're rotten.
Nandita! Nandita!
I won't let you kill yourself!
You can't kill yourself for others!
Let go! I'll help you.
I'll help you, Nandita.
Nandita, let go of it. Leave it now.
Nandita, I'll help you.
I'll help you.
Yash, I really tried.
She's just not ready to come out.
Come on, let's go.
Nandita, it's been four hours.
For how long are you
going to sit here?
The people outside
are laughing at us.
Come on, let's go.
You should leave her
alone right now.
Will you stay out of this?
You've already said enough...
...and done enough!
This is between Nandita and me.
Just get out.
I'm waiting outside for you.
You failed me.
You failed me again.
Nandita, you know
what's so funny?
The battle I was trying to
win against the world...
...I lost in my own house.
You are hiding here
because you think...
...that outside, the
ghost will kill you.
How can someone who doesn't
exist at all...
...help you, Nandita? How?
Just look at yourself!
Has Prithvi brain-washed you?
He's fooling you! He's
lying to you, Nandita!
Why don't you get it?
He's lying to you!
If he's lying, I'm lying,
and the whole world is lying...
...then what is this?
Are these lies too?!
Yash, if this is a lie, then
I want to know what the truth is!
I want my life back.
I want my life back.
I want to live, Yash.
I want my life back.
What's all this, Nandita?
Yash, I've always believed you.
Why can't you believe
me this one time?
Try to look at what's happening...
...from my point of view, Yash.
Please.
I need your help, Yash.
Prithvi was saying that...
...Madhav Sharan's wife
lives in Kalandi.
She can help us, Yash.
Listen to me. I have to
solve this mystery.
Only you can help me do that.
No one else.
- Nandita...
- I need your help!
Nandita, I'm trying to help you!
I want to help you!
But why don't you understand...
...that you need a doctor
and not Prithvi?
My career, my reputation...
...everything is at stake, darling.
Please.
Let's get married.
We'll go someplace far from here.
I never gave anyone as much
importance as I gave you.
The day I decided that
you're the one for me...
...I never ever looked back.
Your reputation, your
work, your career...
...are more important
for you than my life.
I'll go to Kalandi, with
you or without you.
So, is this it?
The end?
I guess it is.
# I chose you as my destination. #
# My heart started beating
after you came into my life. #
# I've considered
you my destination. #
# My heart started beating
after you came into my life. #
# My journey is incomplete
without you. #
# My life resides in you. #
# Be with me, hold my hand,
no matter what happens. #
# Just stand by me. #
I've found two rooms with
great difficulty.
All the hotels are booked here.
Maybe because a fair is going to
be held in Kalandi very soon.
Your room.
Mine's over there, at
the end of the passage.
Your keys.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Who's there?
It's me.
Thank God you're here, Prithvi.
I'm very...
Nandita, it's me!
What happened to you?
Where were you going?
Come on, let's go inside.
I was very scared as a child.
I always used to think
that there's a monster...
...or a ghost hiding
behind my cupboard.
That's why, my dad
gave me the Gita.
I used to sleep keeping
it under my pillow...
...thinking that
a ghost or a monster...
...will never appear before me.
Keep it with you.
You'll be rid of your fears.
These are his blood stains.
He was shot in the 1971 war.
He had the Gita with him then.
They say if he hadn't bent down
to pick it up...
...the bullet would've hit his chest
instead of his hand.
This was his good luck charm.
- Where is he now?
- What?
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
Actually, we never got along.
And now, neither does
he look for me, nor do I.
Our last meeting was very strange.
I wanted to invite him
for my exhibition...
...and he wanted to attend
a protest march.
I fought with him.
In my anger, I told
him that I hated him.
And that was it.
After that, I decided
I'll never be like him.
I'll live just for myself
and not for this bogus world.
Then why did you come
back to help me?
I don't know.
Perhaps I remembered
what he said.
And it's having an effect on me now.
He used to say that the world
is already a masterpiece.
Instead of painting it,
protect it.
Love it.
That's what I am doing.
I'll get going.
Scared you, didn't I?
I often scare people.

We have reached.
Kalandi.
Hello. Hello, Boss.
Vishal here.
Okay.
Boss, they have
set out for Kalandi.
Someone spotted them
on the national highway.
If you want to go there,
you must leave now.
You may get traffic on the way
because of the fair.
There's no other way, Boss.
Boss, hello?
Everything will be destroyed.
This world will come to an end.
- We all will die!
- There is an old myth...
...surrounding this temple.
Take as many baths
as you want!
- Take as many dips in the river
as you want. - Nandita. One second.
Your sins won't get washed away.
We are all sinners.
We are the founders of hell.
No one will see tomorrow's sunrise.
No one will see tomorrow's sunrise.
This city's biggest temple
is in your husbands name.
Madhav Sharan.
Being a priest's wife,
you're leading such a life?
The income I earn is more pious...
...than my husband's, got it?
Do you know why?
Because this money was earned...
...by killing thousands
of innocent people.
Poor, foolish people
used to come to him...
...with their troubles
and sicknesses.
And he used to fool them.
Give me money.
I want money!
Pray. Venerate.
Worship.
Sacrifice this and
that to please God.
God will be pleased!
I'll do this dirty job.
But I won't touch his money.
I don't want to die.
I won't touch his money.
But how did he die?
How did all this happen?
What do you mean?
He had to die!
He had killed innocent people.
He deserved a brutal death.
A rotten one.
Tell me, for how long can anyone
keep that dirty money?
His friends and him had done
some dreadful deeds.
They all died,
one by one.
Do you want to know something?
Someone has returned
from the dead.
He won't spare them.
It's their turn now.
What's happening outside
isn't a fair.
It isn't a fair, sir.
It's a curse on full display.
Animals will die,
people will die.
The place will
look like a graveyard.
Everyone will die.
Inspector Amin will be
the first one to go.
Fool.
Where can we find Amin?
What do I know?
He must be at home.
I've heard he doesn't
venture out anymore.
Not even to work.
He doesn't even meet anyone.
The way a dog takes up a corner
when it's about to die.
He's hiding in a corner
like a dog!
Nandita...
I was waiting for you, Nandita.
How do you know me?
How do you know me?
- Nandita, wait.
- You want to kill me? Kill me.
- Wait, Nandita. - But I won't rest
until I find the truth.
What have you done?
I won't rest until I find out...
...what you've done with
Madhav Sharan and David.
What will happen
at this fair?
Tell me.
- Tell me!
- Stop it!
- What sin have you committed...
- Nandita!
...for which I am suffering!
Don't scream, you hussy!
It all started with you!
Even you're a part of it.
You don't think you
can escape, do you?
No! You will rot like us in hell!
Then why don't you tell
me what I've done?
- Nandita!
- My times up!
It all started with you!
You too will die with us.
Don't look there.
Nandita...
We'll surely find a hospital
here. You'll be okay.
Everything will be okay.
Prithvi, do me
one last favour.
Kill me.
Before I become like Amin,
free me from this trouble.
Please kill me.
You don't need courage to die,
you need courage to live.
And you have the courage.
I've seen that.
Prithvi, there's no other way.
Who will help us?
Who will reveal this secret?
Prithvi, watch out!
Prithvi, don't stop the car.
- What's the matter, Nandita?
- Move.
- What's the matter, Nandita?
- Move!
- Prithvi, don't stop!
- What happened?
Nothing will happen, Nandita.
- What?
- Prithvi, don't stop!
- What are you saying?
- Don't stop!
Nandita!
Nandita, are you okay?
Nandita!
Nandita!
Nandita, stop!
Nandita!
You're impure! You're rotten!
I will come back!
Nandita!
I know everything.
He told me everything.
Who?
This is where he died.
Your father,
Veer Pratap Singh.
What?
You are right, sir.
This water is contaminated.
Your report clearly shows
that this pesticide company...
...has poisoned this river.
If the fair and his factory then...
Then what,
Veer Pratap Singh?
Take my advice.
Be discreet and leave this city.
Go. My men will drop you
to the station.
Go anywhere you want to...
...but leave this place.
Or else be prepared
to face the consequences.
Let Mr. David do his job. Go.
You're right.
Tomorrow is a
very auspicious day.
Devotees from
all over the world...
...are going to come here
to pay homage to God.
The villagers earn their
bread and butter...
...because of these people.
And you're asking us
to fill up the pond with dirt.
God will be unhappy
if we do that.
The poor will lose
their bread and butter.
Do you understand
what it means...
...to obstruct God's will?
Well, I guess you won't need...
...these lab reports anymore.
I don't believe in a God
who doesn't sympathise...
...with His devotees
and a religion...
...where there's no room
for the poor and helpless.
Now, I'll do what I want to.
Don't worry.
God is with you.
I know my life is in danger.
All of them want to kill me.
You're my only hope.
We'll have to stop this fair
as soon as possible.
The lives of thousands of
people are in danger.
Please come.
I'm waiting for you.
# Why are you searching
for me, devotee? #
# I am with you. #
# Neither a pilgrimage,
a statue or a peaceful place. #
# Neither in a temple,
a mosque... #
# ...or any other place of worship. #
# I am with you, devotee.
I am with you. #
# O Devotee... #
# You'll find me in no time,
if you truly look for me. #
# Devotee, I reside in your faith. #
# O Devotee, I am with you! #
# O Devotee, I am with you! #
Where are you going,
Veer Pratap?
If you obstruct a good deed...
...you'll not only die,
but also rot in hell.
You're rotten. You're impure.
Don't teach me about
good and bad deeds.
You don't know the difference
between the two.
# I don't exist in chants
or penance... #
# ...or even in fasts. #
# I don't exist in rituals
or venerations. #
# Not venerations. #
# I don't exist in life,
or in death. #
I'm not up in the sky.
# Neither am I in the caves
made by nature. #
# I don't reside in just anything. #
# I don't reside in just anything. #
# You'll find me in no time,
if you truly look for me. #
# Devotee, I reside in your faith. #
# O Devotee, I am with you! #
# O Devotee, I am with you! #
# O Devotee, I am with you! #
# O Devotee, I am with you! #
# O Devotee, I am with you! #
I'll come back!
God will never forgive you.
I'll come back!
He kept calling out for help...
...for death.
But when no one came,
he committed suicide here.
Your father killed Madhav
Sharan, David Cooper...
...and Amin just as they
had killed him.
He inflicted them with the same
pain that he went through.
What he couldn't do
when he was alive...
...he's trying to do in death.
Nandita, I always thought...
...that my dad didn't care for me.
But the fact is that I abandoned
him in life and in death.
He was trying to say
something to me...
...and I didn't hear him.
Look there.
Thank you for everything.
But I don't understand something.
I know
why I'm here...
...but what have you
to do with all this?
Why did he hurt you?
That's something
even I want to know.
I'll have to do this alone...
...without anyone's help, Prithvi.
Are you okay?
Come on, wear this.
I'm glad
we came here.
You know what Nandita,
I'm sorry.
I guess I could never
understand you.
Anyway, I told you it's
a waste to come so far.
I had to drive 550 kms
unnecessarily.
I came just for you.
You haven't come for me, Yash.
You've come for the tapes.
I know everything.
He has told me everything.
We'll have to stop the
fair at the earliest.
- Thousands of lives are at stake.
- Yes.
- Please come. I'm waiting for you.
- I'm coming.
That water is poisonous.
Oh!
You have two options.
Shut down your pesticide plant...
...and I'll forget anything that
ever happened over here...
...or make me an offer
I can't refuse.
I'm looking for sponsors
for my show...
...if you know
what I mean.
Sponsor my show and these
tapes are yours.
Done.
But I'm going to
take this tape...
...so that you can't
use it against me.
And remember, you're
now party to this crime.
What do you mean?
That's why I was so
afraid of this place.
I couldn't stay here
even for a moment.
Is this not the same place...
...where you traded the tapes and
your conscience for money?
Why did you do this?
Why did you do this?
Why did I do this?
Damn it!
I did it for you!
Wasn't it you
who used to say that...
...emotions and humanity
are a waste of time and money?
Do you remember?
Wasn't it you who said that
if I try selling the truth...
...I'll get peanuts in return?
That's why I hid the
truth and sold it!
For your and my sake.
For our present
and future.
You're the one
who started it all!
Do I want to die
for that money?
Sell the truth and
buy your dreams.
Everyone does it.
So what,
if we do it too?
Yash, you're right.
He said the same thing as well.
I kept looking around
for the culprit...
...not realizing that
I'm the sinner here.
You're not at fault, Yash.
It's my fault.
You only did what
I asked you to do.
I ruined millions of lives
for my happiness.
I'm responsible
for everything.
It all happened
because of me.
Believe me, Nandita.
I was standing there
when they killed him.
I haven't done anything.
And I feel guilty for that.
Let bygones be bygones.
Forget everything. Let's go.
Death hasn't killed him, Yash.
He is here... amidst us.
What do you want?
Where are those tapes?
- Where are those tapes?
- With me.
Yash, we have only four hours.
Call your team here.
We'll have to finish what
Veer Pratap left unfinished.
He wants that.
He wants to be heard.
He hasn't caused you
any harm...
...because he knows only you can
bring the truth out...
...to the world.
You can save the lives of
millions of devotees.
Don't let this calamity
befall. Please, Yash.
There's no other way.
Nandita, everything will be ruined.
Please do it.
Please, Yash.
Vishal, it's me.
Yes. I've got a great story.
Come to Kalandi along
with the entire team...
...as soon as possible.
I'll go get the tapes.
This number does not exist.
Please check the number
you have dialled.
This number does not exist.
Please check the number
you have dialled.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- You think I am stupid?
- Yash...
Why didn't you call him?
You think you'll give me
a lecture on ghosts...
...and I'll get scared?
- Shut up!
- Give me the tape! - Tapes.
Why should I?
I've been telling you since forever
to forget about all this.
I've been begging you...
...but you're just not
listening to me!
Listen to me.
I won't let my career or
future go down the drain.
Enough!
Neither for the sake of
this village...
...nor for Veer Pratap Singh...
Not even for you!
This show will belong to me
in a matter of minutes...
...and no one will be able
to do a thing. Got it?
Forget about it, Nandita.
You need not do anything.
Forget it.
Forget it, please.
Please! Please!
Please! Forget it! Please!
Open the door!
Open the damned door!
Nandita, open the door!
What do you want?
Open the goddamned door!
Nandita, open the door!
Nandita!
Open the door!
Nandita, where do you
think you are going?
No!
Nandita!
I'm doing this
for our own good.
Why do you want to ruin us?
All I want is for us
to be happy.
Give me those tapes!
Yash!
- Yash!
- Give me those tapes!
What did you think?
That you could escape me...
...and tell Veer Pratap Singh's
secret to the world?
Too bad, baby.
Too bad.
Too much of mine is at stake.
This is where I'll bury the
secret along with you.
I could've killed you and extracted
revenge from you...
...as you have killed
my father.
At least I would've felt happy...
...that I fulfilled
the duty of a son.
But the truth is that
if my father wanted...
...he could've killed you like
he killed the others.
He didn't want that.
He didn't want revenge...
He just wanted people
to know the truth...
...which you have kept
hidden till now.
That's all he wanted.
That's all.
Give me the tapes.
Give me the tapes!
Prithvi!
Leave him!
Get away!
You all are crazy!
You are both morons!
There's no one greater than
human beings in this world.
There's no God,
devil or ghost.
Don't you get it?
A man once dead,
is dead.
No one ever comes back
and no one ever will.
Death is the end.
Do you understand me?
Who is it?
As you all can see that...
...the biggest pesticide plant
has been shut down...
...owing to certain shocking
discoveries by Zee News.
The poisonous chemicals released
from this plant...
...were polluting the
pious river for years.
The USC pesticide plant
was shut down.
The devotees weren't allowed
to bathe in this river...
...located at Kalandi.
We were successful in
saving many lives.
We also learnt
an important lesson.
It reminded me of
Vadaniya saying...
...that one person's
good or bad deeds...
...have a direct effect
on the other.
For instance, someone else had to
pay the pricey for my greediness.
I looked everywhere for evil,
but I couldn't find it.
But when I looked within myself...
...there was no one
more evil than me.
