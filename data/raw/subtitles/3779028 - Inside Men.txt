Earn money as much as 300 billion Won of Bank Hangyeol as secret funds.
30 billion of which was used as campaign funds Jang Pil Woo.
All the proof is here.
News that Oh Yeon Soo-nim Hoejang provide sexual entertainment in Byeolwon is true?
Anyone involved women as comfort women?
Before you ever make a declaration accepting retaliation from Oh Jang Hoejang and Congress.

This is an article written or taik dog?
You've heard the relationship between Mirae Motors in Kongress Jang Pil Woo?
Because both people themselves, pretending not to know, so?
According to the observations, it looks like the pause button has been pressed.
What do you want to convey?
Although it is now his bank director had fled abroad and storms temporarily abated,
but some say if he'll be right back.
If so, the prosecutor will be folded hands and closed eyes.
This is the main topic today.
Which also means it's time to climb the car and entered a new era.
A journalist as I could what?
People who choose Kongress Jang that appeared in Yeuiodo, instead Editor Lee?
And also to find him the support of Mirae Motors.
All of this is not the act of Editor Lee?
Even if not immediately,
as long as you help me connect this cord.
That's what I mean.
Under the current situation, this important?

Therefore what is important is next.
To be sure the opposition parties also intend to give up.
Kim Seok Woo, Jang Pil Woo, select one.
People like Jang Pil Woo also can be president, shucks.
I will remain silent?
It is definitely not.
Moreover, Kim Seok Woo is seonbae her high school.
As far as I was still in elementary school seonbae.

How to tow later I'll manage.

Therefore...

What can you do?
Power in the Republic of Korea is no more than a background and click.
That's why I told you ...

 That way, want it or click the background, did not need. </ i>
 Surely you win. </ i>

Do you think is the talk of a prosecutor is like a fart, motherfucker?
You want to wait until all his money runs out you scattered squander and lose one's shirt, you can only be aware of?
Listen carefully!
Mirae Motors earned $ 300 billion from the Bank Hangyeol used as a secret fund.
30 billion of which was used as campaign funds Jang Pil Woo.
You are managing secret funds and intends to ingest 1 billion.
Finally caught and fired.
That's why you came looking for me.
But since been looking for me, at least we have to make a deal.
So what you're actually drinking and drunkenness here?
From this site you now want to directly come with me to the prosecutor's office,
or go home after handing over the evidence?
I got to the bathroom for a while. Dying.

Meat that has been stuck in the corner of the lips instead of flying, damn it!

Why get married? Gileogi want to be a father? <font color = "# FFFF00"> [Gileogi appa - father / husband and wife who send children abroad while he was looking for money in the country to finance them] </ font>
<font color = "# FFFF00"> [Gileogi appa - father / husband and wife who send children abroad while he was looking for money in the country to finance them] </ font>

Live life alone. Life was indeed alone.
But you're going in and out at will like in your own house?
You're not at all concerned the views of others.
More or less have to be a hundred pairs of new eyes I feel daunted.
Why are you so happy?
Expansive.
Or perhaps better suited spelled compatibility?
What do you mean?
Later, when Hyeong-nim plunged into political circles, the financial sector, the academic world,
bring this document
I will also be a slot machine entertainment.
Hyeong-nim.
What if I use this opportunity and do well?
So, exactly what is it?
Received funding of 300 billion from Bank Hangyeol and as much as 30 billion used for the benefit of Jang Pil Woo.
What?
Mirae secret funds Motors.
Hyeong-nim, please save it. I've made a copy of it.
Later certainly pointless. We'll wait.
If directly exposed to seem a little less polite. You know, right?
Fox sly bastard.
Aigoo, precisely because so why children become spirit.
It has been tested and passed the level A. You break it, do not worry.
Rain was so heavy, quickly entered.
This is a file Moon Il Seok manipulate funds.
So using torture methods, all to say.
Plus,

To be sure this is a good thing.
Public opinion and companies are like partners in business marketing.
Editor Lee ...
In the future, I have to ask for help to you.
Yes.
Aigoo, I came too late. Sorry, Hoejang-nim.
It's okay, you arrive at the time of our agreement.
I was thinking lest Congress Jang feel bothered and not willing to come.
If fun just feels troublesome, it is better to die.
How to tackle the problem of temporary workers?
I, Jang Pil Woo is trying to finish well, so do not worry.
This issue will definitely pass.
- Casually. - Yes.
Want to drink a glass?

Yes, Hyeong-nim.
Drink a glass!
thanks.
Kimchinya well.
How is your work?
Today I did a big case. Get ready to be transferred.
Why do not you set up a meeting for me.
By eating together once everything will be solved?
Even without you asking, I also plan to meet with the Congress.
Hyeong, this is a phone that has been filtered. His position could not be traced.
From the position Moonbang, apparently not because they want to earn a few cents they met in the construction of the building.
But from the Congress Jang, the purpose of the meeting is for the sake of money indeed.
Actually, what to do?
His name is Ahn Sang Goo.
Large organization. Some time ago served as affections.
Thugs?
 Yes. </ i>
 In 1988, unrest in the mafia organization. </ i>
 Ahn Sang Goo take advantage of this opportunity. </ i>
 After that he was getting skyrocket. </ i>
 With his ability, he unites the organization. </ i>
 Arguably the peace some time. </ i>
 The building industry, corporate lending, saloon entertainment company knows something. Anyway growing in all directions like an octopus. </ I>
 Plus, I did a little investigation. </ i>
 In 1966, due to the case of radio PD been imprisoned. </ i>
 But before that, a massive investigation carried out during the election period. </ i>
-  Oh, in that case the radio PD cases averted? - Yes. </ I>
Moreover, Moonbang Sajang is confidant Ahn Sang Goo.
 Arguably is the number 3. </ i>
 But why would he be disabled? </ i>
If it was not a severe injury, so there must be a dispute with anyone.
 Who? </ i>
Great political thugs who use their subordinates to obtain a dark secret Jang Pil Woo.
There is no feeling whatsoever?
Yes!
Just finish our homework and the rest will automatically follow the system develops. No need to use violence against violence.
These bastards are still involved in the project?
 Attorney of the Republic of Korea there for the sake of justice. </ i>
 Of course. </ i>
 Of course, I also participated. When is yes it? </ I>
1990 in which the criminals are rampant, everything is also me ringkus.
The mafia and those who live by accepting money from the mafia.
Among these bastards no Attorney General us.
Then you how?
Fuck him that the Attorney General or not. Which certainly caught me who uphold justice.
 Ah, indeed Kongress Jang. </ i>
Enough! Enough!
What is wrong?
Ah, just want to make friends only.

But you do not have any backing, still can to a large Public Prosecutor's Office?
You must be selected by their new first can.
They say once you become a head section, you can stay in Seoul.
 If not, have moved into the area and start from the bottom. </ i>

I just worry alone. Beking just not there.
You now again scold me rabble who had no backing?
Not the rabble.
Just say you do not have the backing only.
Damn, what the hell are you talking now?

What will happen? It does not occur to you?
Listen carefully, Seok Myeong Gwan!

Damn! Who?
Sorry.
What is wrong?
You asked me the phone.
Oh, yes?
Then after examining the evidence available, immediately apply for extended periods of interrogation.
Who? Pleaded whom?
If he lost the election, you will not get amnesty from the President.
It's okay if you have to lie and rot in jail for 10 years?
You're familiar with Moon Sajang Mirae Motors, right?
He is a former chairman of the Project Management Section team.
Two years ago he intends to give documents relating to secret funds.
But was prevented by Jang Pil Woo and Oh Hyeon Soo.
They took off a dog hunters.

The point is that he wants to hand over a copy of that document to me.
Why? Because want me catch Jang Pil Woo and Oh Hyeon Soo this bastard.

Mafia?
Yes, it seems from the gang Sanggu.

Markedly huh? Bastard like crazy.
Asking strangers deal with the problem, it could be unsuccessful.
Stuff I gave you you're a good store?

Now you seem to be fine.
You feel I betrayed you?
Reportedly hyeongsu and your children still in America?
School fees they are all borne by me.
Apartment in Bundang also bought me.
You're threatening me?
Why say so. We do have a past together.
What do you want?
As long as you give me the money I want, soil which covers tens of thousands pyeong everything will be yours.
Sang Goo, if the money was bitten by the monster. Getting bitten, the greater monster.
Fight with monster like that, you know what the consequences will be like?
Damn, I do not want to know. Then fight until death. Hyeong, you do not interfere.
Did you bring a copy of that document?
I did not expect Hyeongnim stained with blood. You decide for yourself.
Why?
Lee Kang Hee decanted wine.
Bitch!
= Yes, Hyeong-nim? =
Did you investigate?
= We managed to find out his schedule. Tomorrow after returning from mountain climbing, going back to the Hotel Royal. =
You have to clean up, understand?
= Good. =
What did Lee Kang Hee? He will not forward it to Jang Pil Woo, right?
He will not say it clearly. He also felt guilty.
But the prosecutor, what should kulaporkan in Single-nim?
Just tell me again to relax fishing village. Enjoy life.
Although I know what it means,
but the organization ... I do not want to get involved.
So? OK.
But it seems that our Daejang and Single Hangook Steel never eat together once.
Good?
There? Very delicious.
Attorney! You're a prosecutor!
Because he is seonbae, so not in the mood rejected. Moreover really just a bite to eat alone.
What is certain is that people learn geopolitics bring bad luck.
Therefore, how to Ahn Sang Goo?
For the moment there has been no movement whatsoever. But, prosecutors ...
Really I just meals only.
Yes yes. So, let's do it right.
Sang Goo, where he is on earth?
Why? Need money? If you need money, work there!
Can be reached only ask for money?
You know Moon Il Seok, right? Me and her...
Aigoo, Sajang ... Why so senile? Too much to drink eh?
Who are you?
Damn!
Attorney!
Damn, why not chase there?
Anu, he brought the bottle.

Cause headache! Useless!

Park Sajang is a person who takes care of the place.

Well, I can own.
Yeah, OK.
Busy?

Precisely because it knows.
Until now I still clean the remnants of excrement.
And wipe your ass.
So ...
Continue to help me remove dirt and wiping butts.
With so new you could be the executive, so the prime minister.
Which is certainly a major player in life has been determined.
Because the rest of your life, you will always be behind.
Help me wipe ass.
 Hell, beraknya would not come out. </ i>
Already awake?
Mafia.
A mafia whose hand was cut,
turns so sontoloyo.
If it was not thanks to me, is dead you.
These people have no manners.
Damn, I was told to use jondae (mall)?
Damn, you've seen the prosecutors who use jondae against a thug?
I went straight to the point. Listen carefully!
Understand?
You remember the Moon Il Seok, right?
Timjang Finance Department Mirae Motors.
Two years ago people were
wants to hand over documents relating to secret funds to me.
Mirae Motors.
But in the middle of it, there are those who grab it.
Who could?
You're asking me?
Is not it because you kidding use the goods and turned into what it is today?
Hence hands hacked, right?
My eardrums burst ya? Why had I heard of a dog barking?
Bitch!
Okay, okay.
Let's make it like this.
Now, what do you want?
Revenge, right?
What do I want?
I want justice.
Because I was the prosecutor of the Republic of Korea, bitch.
Revenge is what you want,
I'll help you.
How? Want to work together?
Not bad.
Mr. Prosecutor.
Ridiculous.
Just now ... just now you said what?
You want justice?
Justice.
In the Republic of Korea is still no such thing as justice?
If you want to seek justice, seek you were there yourself.
I was not interested.
Damn.
As I speak well, he's against.
Hey, listen carefully mafia!
If you're not willing to cooperate now,
using the threat of jail Moon Il Seok,

I wonder how?
Hey!
Hey, prosecutor I've entered into.
Did you see the lights hanging from the ceiling?
Lamp? Lamp!
Okay!

Oh, yes?
Okay! Nice! Good your work!
 Tell him to buy a bottle of soju! </ i>
Fitting behind all later bought a bottle of soju.
Origin bought it.
Which Iseul, Iseul.
Others do not.
Bang Gojang-nim, the mafia that wants that Iseul.
Classic.
Motherfucker.
Damn toilet.
How?
There is a point?
Oh Hoejang absolutely nothing. Jang Pil Woo also been reduced a lot.
With only could get an extension.
Where documents secret fund?
I told dispossessed people.
It...
You talk do not like fart!
You think of what people say it is like a fart?
Well, let's see.
You do not believe in Lee Kang Hee?
Until not make copies?
Hyeong-nim and I
very special relationship.
Damn!
As hyeong-nim conjunction with dongsaeng. Very special.
Public opinion and the mafia have a relationship like brothers.
Fine.
How much you got?
It is not like that.
By Lee Kang Hee.
Which should be given, yes given. Which should have been received, yes accepted.
Damn! Special.
Such relationships.
Well, why do you want to submit documents that secret funds at Lee Kang Hee?
Creepy world.
Without insurance, which can live?
Buy insurance?
Provide insurance without making a copy.
Yes you crazy! Damn!
Damn, did I tell you that captured people?
This person was benra gone mad! Crazy!
Attorney! Attorney!
 Barking course of yesteryear. Damn! </ I>
Attorney, anu ...
it seems better to move the location.
Why?
- Anu, if he were here seems a little ... - So what anyway?
Damn!
Should the Jang Pil Woo also are chasing us.
The distance from Seoul seemed a bit ...
Hey, you!
Got places to stop off in rural areas?
Actually, I had an acquaintance in Gwangju.
But Park Sajang damn well know the person.
Who?
No business?
Bitch!
Your job is capturing all the criminals in Korea?
What is wrong?
Eating alone is not given?
Fit your taste? There is nothing else left to eat.
Yes.
Are you okay?
What? What do you mean?
Out of the police force and became a prosecutor, not happy?
Very delicious.
You'll excuse me.
Excuse me home immediately after eating?
Yes, because tomorrow morning I still have business.
No need, no need. You break it.
Kunyuk!
Be careful!
Good.
Jang Hoon's former room.
Make yourself at home.
Anu ... first met, Asaiah was presumptuous.
This cultivation will surely repay later.
This is not nothing. No need.
Later ...
please help my case alone is sufficient.
Plebeian, do not know anything. Still do not understand this world.
Instead of still do not understand.
Just a little bit disrespectful. Later I will remind you.
Good.
- Do not worry. - Fine.
Go to sleep.
Well, you rest.
<font color = "# FFFF00"> - = If walking through the streets of hell, walk straight ahead. = - </ font>
Crazy.
This just is not enough.
There should be a document that secret funds.
He says there is no copy of it?
For now this is so.
Prof, how are you lately?
Which one?
I was a little worried.
People like this Professor
be so against political factions.
 It must be very tiring. </ i>
The opposition is not easy.
I also need to do something.
Professor...
Therefore...
I have an idea, be kukemukakan?
What?
Ahn Sang Goo ...
Holds a press conference for him, how?
How to document the secret funds?
That ... that I'll let that take care of.
Well, the car may be too.
New buy?
Where the bonus?
Bonus movie's retaliation.
The movie has been released.
It was not the fault of the actors.
But errors director.
For a time, hide first!
Do not carelessly out.
The Goo oppa.
We go along with it.
What is the point of revenge?
We go somewhere like the Maldives.
Drink a glass with me, like old times.
Grave all the memories in my heart. Forget all nostalgiamu.
Hoejang-nim,
keep themselves well huh?
See you later.
For the sake of becoming an attorney, middling worked hard are you.
Dysentery alone ever.
Sitting in front of a desk. Dreams ahead.
Others are so so prosecutors, bright future.
And married to a rich man.
Continue?
Want an arranged marriage?
What is the reason you want to catch Jang Pil Woo?
There seems to be a reason.
As I wanted to be a prosecutor,
not least catch criminals.
Very, very much. Serious.
Mafia like you this.
Disrespectful really!
But, what is the point after being arrested? Damn.
I'm not a graduate of the Police Academy.
Police Academy graduates who not only can spin down.
Talent it is useless. Fortunately, someone else who can.
So I was a prosecutor. Because it is too unfair.
But...
This time the problem is the mafia.
What is the point of work worked hard?
People like me who do not have a shield, also had no backing,
everything "please mampus there", like that.
Korea was a really great country, is not it?
It is true.
Due to the already started, at least be able to produce something.
Where there are prosecutors who have no family tree 'nobility' can be promoted?
Korean Criminal Code, article 2, paragraph 11.
All citizens are equal before the law.
Gender, religion, and social status.
Political, economic, Correctional, culture, life, in all fields,
should not be treated in a discriminatory manner.
Flies shit.
Fuck, damn it!
Hey, mafia!
Hey! Hey!
Our children should not live in the country as it is, is not it?
Then, try to have you arrested.
You have a copy, right?
Ngakunya merely hyeong dongsaeng.
But the truth is lively semati brother, right?
Where?
You make a copy of it before you leave to Lee Kang Hee, right?
Now this level of support for Jang Pil Woo rose 10%.
If left alone, it has been an absolute triumph.
Being president is not a problem.
But you can leave it like that?
I can not let the president like that.
Before the election tomorrow,
submit the documents.
Do not you want to use me to catch Jang Pil Woo?
If it's like that, just take advantage of me.
If not, you ...
will live life like people with disabilities,
living in hiding.
 All my life ... for life. </ i>
Before my father died, he said
Sang Goo, be a good person.
I'll be watching you from above.
This is...
documents obtained from the hands of Moon Il Seok.
But,
How to record in the villa?
Why Kim Jong Il develop nuclear weapons?
Documents secret funds that must remain confidential.
If only the video just for what?
A bomb.
Although this was not planned from the beginning,
Such action is also arguably a vengeance.
It...
He wanted to drink a glass on the island of the Maldives. Bastards.
Want to taste
I kill everything.
Want me to do it yourself?
Documents secret funds
Also to be investigated can only be used as evidence.
What should I do?
Of course in the process of detention can not be avoided.
You're also not without one.
Damn.
What I want is not justice, but revenge.
Want to catch Oh Hyeon Soo and Jang Pil Woo, there is no other choice.
Sorry.
Rely on yourself a prosecutor,
and toying.
Justice bitch.
You think I do not know why you want to be successful you do this.
If caught Jang Pil Woo, you can only bring about change.
Act like it's wrong anyway? Damn!
Do not have a shield, also had no backing.
By capturing the criminals I want to show my ability.
Should not I be?
Did not you approached Lee Kang Hee also because they want to be successful? Bastard!
Right now you're like a dog abandoned by the employer.
- The bastards! Bastard! - You still do not understand, bitch?
Not Jang Pil Woo, but Lee Kang Hee.
Mirae Motors, Bank Hangyeol, Jang Pil Woo.
From the beginning the person operating a secret fund is Lee Kang Hee.
And also this, this, this.
The person who makes your hand like this is Lee Kang Hee.
You crazy.
What do you mean? It...
Replaced the main players.
Never following a script, always acting alone.
If we replace the people, then he could be benign.
Jang Pil Woo will be obedient?
We just need to choose a new actor only. Not a big thing.
Not a striker, but midfielder?
When the movie was finished running, he would know.
If he is not the protagonist, is only supporting actor.
Aigoo, Editor Lee.
Do you know how much money is spent to invest in him?
Capital alone is not turning, you're now asking me to invest again?
That's no way to do business.
Plus ...
Compared Kim Seok Woo, Jang Pil Woo more obedient ..
You must have this kind of awareness.
If the ghosts are crazy treasure gathering together, the smell would not be so oppressive.
Just a moment please.
Hello?
Hyeong-nim, it's me.
My mind was more chaotic, so remember Hyeong-nim.
Are you okay?
Where are you?
Demi rid itself of errors, you prepare it, is not it?
= Not afraid I sue? =
You're wiping ass Jang Pil Woo, right?
It turns out you have a copy.
Where there are businesses that only accept a bullet instead?
If you want revenge, maybe I can help.
In order to get the secret funds, how much money did you receive?
How about for a bit to the person who shot the bullet?
= Hyeong-Hyeong-nim nim ... ... =
Where should you treat me like this?
You do not have as smooth acting.
The person who collects the coffers through Jang Pil Woo are you, bitch?
Bitch!
At that time, you say?
Told me to take documents that secret funds.
As a result, hand cut.
 Hyeong-nim, please save it. </ i>
 Later certainly pointless. We wait. </ I>
 If directly exposed to seem a little less polite. You know, right? </ I>
You've never seen a bear like a fox?
= Must know the limits. =
= How can a dog traitor to replace the employer and barking here? =
Sang Goo, stop barking. Come here obediently.
What do you want to talk about already finished. You rest in peace.
It had been planned from the beginning?
Memperalatku like this.
For life in hiding, which could possibly know?
Then you want me to do?
I want to go to jail?
If you want to catch the bastards, there is only this way.
Choose.
Want to which.
People will remember what I look like?
You want your shapes like what they remember?
Loving justice.
Die for justice.
Gregg, the hell is this?
The hair must be trimmed.
Clothes also select one set better.
 Damn. </ i>
It is obtained from the Finance Department Timjang hand Mirae Motors.
Earn money as much as 300 billion Won of Bank Hangyeol as secret funds.
30 billion of which was used as campaign funds Jang Pil Woo.

Now it's almost time to start.
The water is bad, right?
Just now there are matters to attend to first.
Nothing feels uncomfortable, right?
Bastard.
I once read an article that you wrote.
Which articles you mean?
The prosecutor's investigation of excessive lead Myeong Seong Gwan suicide.
He was also interrogated here, right?
But why the man was killed?
Did not you kill?
With the hand used for writing.
Is not it?
Your words seem too excessive.
Next time please my interrogation in accordance with the facts.
Do not make up stories again.
Then let's talk facts alone. Time is also not much.
The Jang Pil Woo and Oh Hoejang it ...
Bahagiakah life to lick their ass?
Bastard!
Who lick whom?
Aigoo, so be it if it does not lick.
If seen look, it looks like first when you democratization movement was also so persistent.
Until visited the site to publish.
But people like that
why now ...
could sit here?
Then you yourself why be here?
Capturing Ahn Sang Goo are like idiots.
Why can slumped like this?
Is not the same reason?
You, me, the thing that we're after.
Do you think this meeting because of what?
Even so, I ...
you're not such a terrible thing.
That's not what I mean.
You introduce Ahn Sang Goo Jang Pil Woo and Oh Hoejang, right?
I did not ever do anything like that.
Why the president of a large company and a politician called him a thug?
Common sense could not understand.
Oh, I see.
Let me briefly yes.
In 1995, due to the union strike Mirae Motors using the services of thugs.
In 1996, the elections to the 15th Party Sinjeong mobilize thugs.
In 1998, upon acquiring a car factory Mirae also mobilize the power of thugs.
Now it is common sense, was somewhat understandable?
How does it work, not easily visible.
Is not a lot of statements like this?
By the time the prosecutor investigating suspects
When a reporter wrote a public opinion too.
Often they write like that, is not it?
But,
This is a joke that often exist?
You know?
Hard to explain what purpose.
Hard to explain whether intentional.
There is hard to explain what kind of relationship.
Hard to explain there is a demand like.
But,
for a thug like Ahn Sang Goo
how to practice?
 Arguably no other purpose. </ i>
Arguably due to deliberate.
Arguably nothing to do.
Arguably there is a demand.
It could even be written into a meaning that can be expressed clearly.
Bastard, what are you doing this?
 Even saying the same POINTS, </ i>
there are people who say difficult to explain what, what.
 But there are also people who immediately say what, and see it clearly. </ i>
The language is a right which is also a strength.
Where the crazy people who believe what a thug?
Hmm, it's time published daily in the morning.
May I read the papers?

need evidence and witnesses.

Have you hired to kill?
I kill people or not,
Please ask Coach Choi at the Training Institute.
Sexual violence?
Min Ji Ah ...
works very hard
in search of a new boss for the other members.
All I said is a fact.
I've done everything you asked.
Because want to catch Jang Pil Woo, because it
I've done everything you asked.
 What is your response to the problem Ahn Sang Goo is it? </ i>
In accordance with the results of the investigation by the police facts.
I did not ever introduce Ahn Sang Goo to Oh Jang Hoejang or Congress.
 With the mafia Ahn Sang Goo only met a few times while collecting material for an article. </ i>
 Then, according to Ahn Sang Goo lied to you? </ i>
 Now Ahn Sang Goo get paid to kill, </ i>
 plus the fact that he sexually assaulted a female singer has been leaked to the public. </ i>
I want you to mafia is
focuses on the mobilization of companies, politics
plus
for the sake of freedom of speech and public life,
reputation that has been my life kudedikasikan
have been damaged and stained.
It is deeply regrettable.
 She's supposed to have died two days. </ i>
 It looks like hell suicide by burning gas ethane. </ i>
 plus </ i>
he finished a meeting with Choi Jang Pil.
Was killed on instructions Ahn Sang Goo.
Plus,
in an atmosphere of election
appears a case like this.
Mafia Ahn Sang Goo receive instruction from someone unknown
intervene in the political world and also the facts related.
The public can judge for themselves.

Hyeong-nim ...
Hyeong-nim forgive me.
I am also in order to sustain life.
Sorry.
Joo Eun Hye who was killed?
Sorry, I've killed him.
On the instructions of Lee Kang Hee.
Why was he killed?
Lee Kang Hee know about me and threatened me.
He said only in this way can live Hyeong-nim.
Yes, already visible.
In situations like this
Ahn Sang Goo caught or not
is not important.
Yes, Hoejang-nim.
No matter Ahn Sang Goo say,
who also believe?
I did not do anything.
Ahn Sang Goo himself who chose the wrong path and doing the wrong thing that dropped like this.
 Why so happy? </ i>
So senangkah could set me up?
Another time my new phone again.
There is guest.
No business?
Because Hyung-nim, I come bearing gifts.
Want Hyeong-nim that here,
or I were there?
Oh, do not mempelototiku. Relax, relax.
As a dongsaeng, I came because there I wanted to ask.
The friendship between Hyeong-nim and I are already many years,
I do not believe Jang Pil Woo and Oh Hyeon Soo.
I just believe a Hyeong-nim.
Why?
Because I was dongsaengmu, Hyeong-nim.
No matter whatever filthy world,
by-Hyeong-nim, dongsaeng come licking the knife.
The Goo ...
That's why I told you to stop everything.
In order to get what you want, you pass your days to lick the knife. The comfortable are?
It seems there is no way to communicate again.
Now I betrayed by you.
What do you want?
But, should Joo Eun Hye was killed?
It was not me who killed him.
And bribe Moon Il Seok.
Told her to lie and say never gave documents secret funds.
I do not know about this.
Lastly, I want to ask.
The greatest liar in history, assassin, perpetrators of sexual violence, all of these allegations
is an idea from you, right?
What do you want?
Want to take the ax?
Son of a bitch!
I look easily bullied?
What do you think of this place?
Basic thugs!
Bitch! The bastards!
Bastard!
Bitch!
Jang Pil Soo deeds.
I told Jang Pil Soo.
Killing Joo Eun Hye,
make accusations you kill, and rape,
everything on the instructions of Jang Pil Woo.
You will also feel a day like this.
Left hand next to it, use it to wipe your ass.
No need to write any article.

It seems not easy if would be used as evidence.
The words spoken when someone's life is threatened,
of course, can not be used as evidence.
You know, why they come here?
But, what if these records fall into the hands of Jang Pil Woo?
It will not be easy as it is completed.
That person, if it arises a sense of suspicion in the heart, will not be able to believe again.
People who betrayed me, it is definitely not going to wear it again.
What do you want to say?
Position you get through Jang Pil Woo,
let others who do, how?
These days you intend to cooperate with me and start from scratch?
As if I was told to cooperate with you?
Give me the book used the loan to me.
As a prosecutor, at least this time I should be able to catch one.
Or become a friend.
If so, please yes.
 These days, the prosecutor is not only required to show the facts of a case, </ i>
but also to be able to build a country with the rule of law is more a reality for its citizens.
 In the future, will not be subject to any power. </ i>
The money has been received?
Yes, the book was successfully obtained.
Now what to do?
Do not be too tense. Let's just say you want to go on a blind date.
Good.
You should have been met by Gwon Single people.
Well, I'll be careful.
I think it was a school friend of Kim Seok Woo.
Yes.
The election was close, but the level of support is still mediocre.
This is evidence of scandalous Kim Seok Woo and Han Il Construction.
The plot is set. Stay exposed at the right time.
Well, I understand.
Jo Sangmu, long time no see., Sometime back?
There are already several days.
Here alcohol is a lot, why still bring drinks here?
First time visiting here, which may come up empty-handed?
