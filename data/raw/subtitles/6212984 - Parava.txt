Go to the shop.
I told you to go to the shop.
How long are you taking?
If you don't listen,
I'll fry all of it.
If you touch my fishes, I'll kill you.
Go away. I'll kill you.
Why are schools giving
so many holidays?
I wish they open as soon as possible.
You took only this fish?
He stole only this
fish from here...Right !!
For what? We just needed
to take our fish back.
Go away lchaPPi!
Come, Haseeb!
Come on.
The boys have started
training their pigeons.
It seems like they will participate
in Pigeon Tournament this time
That male pigeon won't
fly long enough without its mate
These two won all the
tournaments in the past.
Even now the boys
don't know where it is.
All our tournaments
are won by its babies.
He is still searching for his partner.
" PARAVA"
Today they will fly very well,
lchappi!
Damn! He is landing back.
Just shut up Haseeb!
Not even 2 minutes
Let us feed them. They must be hungry.
Just Get lost.
There is problem
with the carrom board.
For everyone else there is no problem.
Don't waste time! play!
There is no time.
I have to go for marriage.
You do one thing. You fly
the other Blue rock Pigeon's baby.
Okay.
What is happening?
Where are they all going?
Come... come...
Come! Come!

Get our birds down.
What are you guys waiting for?
Whose bluerock pigeon is that?
Yah! Which pigeon is that?
They are looking here.
Its theirs only ...Fly it away
Have you started your play?
When the cage opened
up they all flew away.
From there we saw what you were doing.
No!
I know you will fly one day
- No I wont
They have set eyes on
our 'Double Eyed Pigeon'.
That 'Double Kanni' is good.
Informing Rafooka we'll steal that.
- What?
- It is ours.
You are back again...
To eat my mung beans...
I'll close this window
and will never let you in
What is that on top?
Will you guys break everything?
Mother is calling for breakfast.
I'm terribly hungry.
It is 'Rice pancake' and beef.
Without coconut milk
nothing tastes that good.
What is this, lchappi?
Don't finish the water?
- Haseeb, did you wash your hands?
- I'll wash after having food.
Go and wash. There is no cleanliness.
From morning you have
been chasing pigeon and fish.
Saad Lamjarred - lm3allem (song)
- Don't scare me
- Look at that...
After vacation other children appear
healthy by eating good food from home.
But both of you appear dark like apes.
- What is this?
- Its a flower arrangement
Haseeb, how did you pass?
By copying from him.
Then what about the
subject in which he failed?
What is this? Shouldnt
you have given it to him also?
Haseeb! Haseeb! Give it.
I haven't written anything.
Give it.
Okay, that's it.
Tie up your papers please!
Just because he failed in
one subject my son lost one year.
Ichaapi,
should I put cover for your book?
You put yours and
the remaining for me.
I'm done with mine.
To write the failed subject?
He is going to learn the
same book this year also, isn't it?
He hasn't written anything
in the previous year.
You write properly at least this year.
Mother, didn't you
give them clam meat?
Is there clam meat?
She is fooling you both.
There is no clam meat in here.
Go away!
She unnecessarily made me greedy.
Haseeb!
Give this to your mother.
Make sure it reaches home.
lchappi, I'm leaving.
Your breakfast is here. Have it.
- Come on!
- lchappi! lchappi! lchappi! lchappi!

lchappi! lchappi! lchappi! lchappi!
lchappi! lchappi! lchappi! lchappi!
What is this, lchappi?
Is this sports?
Everyone else learned how to flip
Somebody make him understand
He won't understand even if taught.
What happened to you?
You jump and roll.
If you do it once, its easy.
That's only if I can do it once right?

Mom asked to get
them back to their cage
Come... come...
From tomorrow we have
to go to school, isn't it?
Dear Haseeb! Don't tell
me boring words at mid night.
Hearing this I lost my sleep. Get in.
Yes. I had.
Yes!
Yah! Yah...!
