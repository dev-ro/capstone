Okay, here we go.
Yeah. No, I'll be good
with this.
Okay. I'm ready.
Alright. Thank you.
To those who are
enthralled by mountains,
their wonder is
beyond all dispute.
To those who are not,
their allure is
a kind of madness.
What is this strange force
that draws us upwards?
This siren song
of the summit?
Only three centuries ago,
setting out to climb
a mountain
would have been considered
an act of lunacy.
The idea scarcely existed
that wild landscapes
might hold
any sort of attraction.
Mountains were places
of peril, not beauty.
An upper world to be shunned,
not sought out.
How then have mountains now
come to hold us spellbound,
drawing us into
their dominion...
often at the cost
of our lives?
Because the mountains we climb
are not made only
of rock and ice,
but also of dreams
and desire.
The mountains we climb
are mountains of the mind.
To humans, high mountains
were once considered the home
of either the holy
or the hostile.
There was nothing in between.
A realm to be
revered from below,
but never entered.
Go around mountains
if necessary,
along their flanks,
but not up them...
for only gods and monsters
dwelled at height.
The upper world was
a sacred landscape
to which we directed
our devotion
and our rituals of awe...
...but always
from a safe distance.
Daily life brought ample
hardship and danger.
There was no need
to seek out more.
Gradually, though,
the dragons and divinities
were put to flight,
and our feelings
toward mountains
underwent an astonishing change.
Fascination replaced
trepidation.
Adventure replaced reverence.
As cities grew
and we insulated ourselves
away from nature,
the mountains called us back.
The magic of mountains
strengthened:
their fierce beauty,
their power to enchant,
their challenge.
We went in search of places
that were intimidating
and uncontrollable,
that inspired in us
the heady blend
of pleasure and terror,
which we came to call
the sublime.
This search for the sublime
drew us outwards and upwards.
The great peaks
of the world
began to exert a force
upon the imagination.
A siren song
that was easy to hear,
hard to resist...
and sometimes
fatal.
But legends of
death in high places
spread the spell
of the mountains
wider still.
Slowly,
the blank spaces on the maps
were filled in.
The imperial aim was to grid,
girdle, and name
the upper world.
To bring it and its peoples
within the realm
of the known
and the owned.
To replace mystery
with mastery.
And the greatest
mystery of them all?
Everest.
And so began the campaign
to vanquish it.
Everest was placed
under siege.
Until, at last, it succumbed.
This was the moment
that mountaineering
as adventure
entered the popular imagination.
Our fascination
became an obsession.
Now our need for mountains
runs deep and wide,
for most of us exist
for most of the time
in environments
that are humanly arranged
and controlled.
But mountains are wild
and ungovernable.
This is the source
of their danger
and also the source
of their allure.
And so, a longing
for the unknown
beckons us onwards.
Like Echo's Cave,
the unknown will answer back
with whatever
you call into it.
To travel to the high peaks
is to cross a threshold
into a space where
time warps
and bends,
and sensations are
thrillingly amplified.
Stone and ice, though,
are far less gentle
to the hand's touch
than to the mind's eye.
The mountains of the Earth
have often turned out
to be more resistant,
more fatally real,
than the mountains
we imagine.
These are matters
of hard sharp rock
and driving ice...
...of bone-deep cold...
Less than ideal.
Ahh! Ahh!
...injury and nausea...
...fizzing fear...
Ahh!
...of stomach-turning vertigo...
Oh God, take me home.
But
they are also places
of unspeakable beauty.
And so the peaks
summon us still,
sharpening our sense
of being,
setting life on a knife-edge.
For danger can hold
terrible joys...
...dreadful splendors.
Today, mountains are considered
among nature's
most exquisite features.
No longer do their
chaotic forms
upset the spirit level
of our minds.
Now, we migrate to them
in our millions each year,
pursuing our strange
pilgrimages.
A very modern mountain
worship has taken hold...
...a worship that requires
the modification
of the mountains...
...and the management
of their risks.
And in doing so,
we have come to forget
something of their power.
What odd devotions
we undertake!
What curious
performances we put on,
with the mountains
as our theatre!
To certain people,
the call to adventure
is irresistible.
As everyday life has become
safer and more comfortable
for some,
we have begun to seek
out danger elsewhere.
We court danger.
We pay for it.
Risk has become
its own reward.
At height,
you can be taken
right to the brink...
...for you never feel
so alive,
knowing that,
at any minute,
you could die.
So up to the mountains we go,
in headlong pursuit
of peril...
...or a testing ground
on which the self
can best be illuminated.
Today's adventurers
are driven by the lust
to reach somewhere
no one has reached before...
...and to do something
no one has done before.
Our wish to be first
induces in us
forms of insanity...
...and forms of grace.
Adventurers sometimes
liken fear to a rat.
When you take risks,
you feed the rat with fear.
But each time
you feed it that fear,
it grows fatter.
So then you must
feed it more fear
to sate it,
and yet more again,
and then still more...
until a madness bites.
How has it come to this?
The mountains as a stage set
for a pumped-up poker game
of high stakes
and high returns,
all driven by big brands
and online views.
Many who travel to mountain tops
are half in love
with themselves
and half in love
with oblivion.
Today's mountain mania
culminates on Everest,
where the wish
to test one's limits
or to battle one's demons
draws thousands of people
to the peak each year.
Attempting Everest
offers a way
for the ordinary person
to be briefly extraordinary.
But the nature
of the challenge
has, in many ways, changed.
This isn't climbing anymore.
It's queuing.
This isn't exploration.
It's crowd-control.
This is the modern industry
of ascent,
in which the risks
are often taken most
by those who have least.
But mountains
exceed our command.
They slip our grip.
And there is no glory
for those who are left behind.
Mountains are so much
more than a challenge
or an adversary
to be overcome...
...for mountains humble
the human instant
and reveal our insignificance.
They live in deep time
in a way that we do not.
Behind and beyond
the mountains
stretch aeons too vast
for us to comprehend.
They were here long before
we were even dreamed of.
They watched us arrive.
They will watch us leave.
Born of fire,
born of force,
mountains move.
Over epochs,
they rise and fall.
This is the symphony
of the earth...
...a rhythm of uplift
and erosion
that makes
not waves of water,
but waves of stone.
And from these waves of stone
flows life.
Being in the mountains
can ignite our astonishment
at the simplest transactions
of the living world.
Anyone who has been
among mountains
knows their indifference,
has felt a brief,
blazing sense
of the world's
disinterest in us.
In small measures,
this feeling exhilarates.
In full form, it annihilates.
Coming back to Earth
from the high peaks,
you can feel
like a stranger,
bearing experiences
that are beyond expression
and beyond price.
Time has flown over you,
but left its shadow behind.
Mountains don't
seek our love
or seek our deaths.
They want nothing from us.
And yet, they shift the way
we see ourselves.
They weather our spirits...
...challenge our arrogance...
...restore our wonder.
More than ever,
we need their wildness.
