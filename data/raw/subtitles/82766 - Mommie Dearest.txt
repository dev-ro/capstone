Yes?
We're ready for you, Miss Crawford.
Let's go!
And on our left, up the hill, is the
home of movie queen Joan Crawford.
Excuse me.
- Helga's finished in the living room.
- Good.
Carol Ann, help me with this.
Helga! When you polish the floor,
you have to move the tree.
If you can't do something right,
don't do it at all.
- I'm sorry, Miss Crawford.
- Give me the soap!
You see, Carol Ann, you have to stay
on top of things every single minute.
- Carol Ann, you get that.
- Yes, Miss Crawford.
Helga, I'm not mad at you,
I'm mad at the dirt.
Mr Savitt, come in.
- Greg? You're early.
- Only an hour and a half.
Take your shoes off.
I've just washed that floor.
What about the socks?
I can handle the socks.
Hello, Bridget.
Miss Crawford,
words cannot express our gratitude
for the happiness
you bring our children.
No, I'm the one who's grateful,
Reverend Mother.
Being with the children at Christmas
is one of the things I look forward to.
Bridget, look.
Merry Christmas, Bridget.
- You know what's missing in my life?
- A hit movie.
- You've got everything you want.
- I don't. I want a baby.
- A baby?
- Yeah.
- You know I've always wanted a kid.
- You're too vain to be pregnant.
Vain.
I can't have one.
I was pregnant seven times
with Franchot. I lost them all.
I am going to adopt one.
- Out of the question.
- What do you mean?
- No agency would give you a baby.
- How do you know?
- I'm a lawyer.
- Bend the law!
You're an actress,
you've been divorced twice.
Adoption agencies can be brutal.
Besides, a baby needs a father.
Father.
A father.
I never had one. Ma changed husbands
faster than she changed bedsheets.
Ma, with her sloppiness and dirt!
Hard times is good for people.
Would I be where I am
if I hadn't had them?
I could teach a kid to look after himself
and amount to something. I could!
Maybe you could. One thing's certain,
you'd sure get a lot of publicity.
Bastard!
You guys in Hollywood. All you think
about is publicity, deals, box office.
Why don't you try
to understand a woman?
I'm afraid I have some difficult news
for you, Miss Crawford.
The agency has denied
your application for adoption.
Why?
Well, you live alone. There is no other
family member in the home.
You have two previous divorces.
You're a busy, active woman.
''The candidate is found
to be an unsuitable parent.''
Unsuitable?
- Please, Miss Crawford.
- Don't you dare judge me!
We have a moral
and legal responsibility.
You don't understand.
What you're doing is denying
one of your children
the opportunity to live a wonderful
and advantaged life.
How sad that is.
Good afternoon.
Do I look all right? Am I dressed right?
For God's sakes, Joan.
I want everything perfect.
Perfect!
The kid's a couple of months old.
It's not going to know.
- I know. Why aren't they here?
- I don't know.
Please!
I don't want whisky on your breath.
Damn it, Joan.
I got you the baby. It's yours!
I know.
They're here.
Hello. Please, this way.
- We're so pleased, Miss Crawford.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Hello!
Oh, Greg!
She's perfect.
You're perfect.
My daughter.
My own daughter!
I'm going to make a perfect life for you.
I'm going to give you
all the things I never had.
My beautiful little darling!
You're a lucky girl, and very expensive.
You cost me a lot of favours.
I'm going to call you...
...Christina.
Christina, darling.
My darling daughter.
My own...
...Christina Crawford.
Are you having a happy birthday,
Christina, darling?
This is the best party I ever had!
- I love you, Mommie Dearest.
- I love you, Tina, darling.
- Hello, darling.
- Here's your mommie.
This is Christopher, my second child.
I would like to adopt every
unwanted child in the world.
Look at that, darling!
Life is tough enough
when you are wanted. Isn't it?
It's time for his nap.
- He's sleepy.
- Have Nanny tuck him in properly.
Christina!
Birthday girl! What do you think?
- Should we open the presents now?
- Yes.
- Do you think it's about time, too?
- Yes.
- I'm not so sure.
- Please!
- Look right there.
- Miss Crawford?
The studio would like some shots of
you watching Christina open a present.
All right, Jimmy. Come on, darling.
Oh! I have a grass stain.
- Darling, that will never show.
- I'll have Nanny take care of it.
- No, we'll take the photographs now.
- Actually, it might read.
All right, dear. Go along and have
Nanny fix it. We'll wait for you here.
OK, Christina...
Over a little more, Christina...
OK, big smile, Christina.
OK, Christina, wide smile, now.
Wide eyes. OK?
A little to your right, Christina.
Come on, Christina. Beautiful!
- She's a real natural.
- I think that's enough now, Jimmy.
Tina, tell the children to come up
and we'll open the presents for real.
OK.
I promised the studio some stuff
when she blows out the candles.
All right, Jimmy.
Oh, Mommie, thank you.
She's so beautiful!
What should I name her?
- Is that the present you like best?
- Oh, yes!
Then that's the present you can keep.
We'll take the rest to the orphans
who don't have anything.
And tomorrow
we'll write our thank-you notes.
Christina, why can't you...?
Hello, hello!
Happy birthday, darling.
Hello, darling.
Oh, Uncle Greg!
It's just what I wanted.
- Do you like it?
- I love it!
But you see,
I'm only keeping one present.
All the rest I'm giving
to the poor orphans.
Yes, I read about that
in the newspapers. It's wonderful.
So, I'll just keep this for you
until you don't have to choose.
I put a lot of thought into this
when I picked it for you.
All right.
This time we'll make an exception.
You may keep the doll
and the bracelet.
Oh, Mommie Dearest!
What about Christopher's present?
This one.
Darling, remember what I told you
about adopted children?
Adopted children are luckiest,
'cause they were chosen.
That's right.
That's good! But you've got
to push off more with your weight.
- Let's see another one!
- She's had enough.
- I'm tired, Mommie.
- Quitter!
All right, ready?
One, two, three, dive!
Better, but keep your legs together
when you go in the water.
She's only a kid.
So was I, only a kid.
I learned early!
Life goes by too fast. You've got
to know how to compete and win.
I don't want her growing up
a spoiled Hollywood brat
just because
she's Crawford's daughter.
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
It's a great Sunday at home...with a star.
You know, we hardly ever
have nice days like this any more.
I've got an appointment.
They call, you run.
Who calls, I run?
Nobody.
- Then why do you say that?
- Because I'm mad at you!
Why?
This is the best script the studio has,
and it hasn't been offered to me.
You could help.
That's Mayer's business. I never tell
a man I respect how to run his business.
They think I'm slipping.
- Are you?
- No.
So?
Yes.
I just want that part!
- I want you, too.
- You got me.
- Have a good time, Tina.
- Thanks, Uncle Greg.
I love you.
- Who wants to go swimming?
- I do!
- I'll race you!
- On your mark, get set...go!
Again?
I'll give you a bigger head start.
Come on, Tina!
On your mark, get set...go!
You lost again!
It's not fair! You're bigger than I am.
It's not fair to win twice!
But nobody ever said
that life was fair, Tina.
I'm bigger and I'm faster.
I will always beat you.
Then I'm not going to play with you
any more, ever!
Don't you ever use
that tone of voice with me, missy!
Who do you think you're talking to?
You will march yourself upstairs
to your room
and stay there
until I tell you to come out!
- No, I won't!
- No, you won't?
Yes, you will!
- I won't go!
- All right! You will stay in here
until you are ready to behave
and to apologise.
- I won't!
- Get in!
- Fans should know the price you pay.
- Mayer should know the price I pay.
The biggest female star he's got,
ever had.
And he's burying me alive.
- Where's Tina?
- She'll be down in a minute.
Hello, darling.
Oh, God.
Hello?
- Yes, sir. Joan.
- Who? At this hour?
It's Mr Savitt,
calling from Mr Mayer's office.
Greg, darling.
Hello. Anything wrong?
We had a sudden little labour problem,
so we had a sudden little early meeting.
By the way, Mayer thinks
you'd be wonderful in that picture.
What? What, Greg?
I tried to talk him out of it, but I couldn't.
- No, Greg, wait!
- Goodbye.
No, Greg!
Wait a... Greg, oh!
Carol Ann!
I've got it!
I've got it!
I've got it! I've got it!
Christina! Darling, guess what?
Oh, yes. It was thrilling.
I'm so grateful to you all.
My wonderful fans
who've made me a star.
Oh, yes, it was thrilling.
I'm so grateful to you all.
My wonderful fans
who've made me a star.
Mommie?
What do you think you're doing?
Nothing, Mommie. I was just playing.
What do you mean, playing?
Going through my things?
Making fun of me?
I wasn't making fun of you.
I was just trying to...
I was acting, play-acting,
like you're always doing.
Look at yourself!
Gimme that!
Ow!
What have you done?
What have you put on your hair?
- What have you done to this hair?
- I'm sorry!
It was just setting lotion.
Mom, ow!
What are you doing?
- Oh, Mommie, don't!
- Don't you tell me what I'm doing.
- I look awful!
- I know you look awful.
Be quiet! You're always trying to find
a way to make people look at you.
Why are you always looking
at yourself in the mirror? Tell me!
Sit still! This ought to teach you!
- You're vain, spoiled.
- I can't go to school like this!
I'd rather you go bald to school
than looking like a tramp!
No, Mommie. Please, no!
I can't go to school like this.
Mommie, please, don't!
You spoiled it just like I spoiled you.
Mom!
Good evening, Miss Crawford, welcome.
Your booth is ready.
Excuse me.
I'm glad they let go of you. We were
about to send out a rescue party.
Hello, LB. What a pleasant surprise.
I want you to meet
a few financial friends.
- Mr Lubin.
- It's a pleasure.
- Mr Dodd.
- Please, sit down. Join us.
My daughter would love
to have your signature.
You see, she didn't ask
for L B Mayer's signature.
That's because
she's not as smart as her father.
She doesn't know
that you are the king.
Where are you going? You're one
of the reasons bankers love Metro.
- Thank you, but our table is ready.
- I insist.
You're aces, Joanie.
Glad you think that, LB,
because aces beat kings.
Not in Hollywood, dear.
I'm sure you'll find
the interest arrangements agreeable.
We'll all meet in New York.
Hauling me over to Mayer's table
like some picked-up floozy.
Or one of those starlets, out to give
the big shots a nice night in town.
Is that what you think of me?
How many drinks is that?
When you were a kid that made you
look sexy. Now you just look drunk.
You may as well have ''Property
of MGM'' tattooed on my backside!
Damn it! Perino's is my place.
Nobody wanted my signature,
so I just walked in.
You expect me to ignore my fans?
They're life and death to me, baby.
They're the ones who really made me.
I expect you to walk in
and sit down at your table with me!
Then Mayer would bring his bankers
over, get your autograph and leave.
- That's what you should have done!
- Maybe I would have,
if you'd been nice enough to help me
through the crowd, like a gentleman.
- Why are you screaming?
- Because I'm damn mad!
Damn it, Greg.
How can you put Mayer over me?
You know that son of a bitch
is trying to destroy my career.
If your career's in trouble,
it has nothing to do with him.
- Then what is it?
- You were always the shop girl
who fought her way to the top,
made a great success!
You're not a little shop girl any more.
That's the truth, to face and deal with,
if you want to survive.
The truth is you're getting old.
Yeah, you're nothing
but a rotten, crooked lawyer...
...supplying the grease that makes
this shitty movie business work.
You think your life's a mystery.
There isn't a cover-up in this business
that I don't know about.
- And your hand is in every one of them!
- Damn you!
Are you crazy? No person talks
to me like that! No one, anywhere!
Are you crazy? Are you? Tell me!
- Tell me!
- I'm crazy.
I didn't mean that, Greg.
I didn't mean it.
Get up. There's no camera in here.
Greg.
Where are you going?
Where I belong.
Out of here.
You belong here.
I'm waiting for you.
Goodnight, Joan.
Please don't leave.
If you do, you'll never come back in,
no matter what you say, or ask, or do.
I'll always wish you well, Joan.
And I'll only speak well of you.
Please don't go!
Don't leave me here alone.
Please!
If you're acting, you're wasting your time.
If you're not, you're wasting mine.
I'm not acting!
I'm not acting.
Goodnight.
Good luck.
Goodbye.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, dearest heart.
Hello, darling.
Hello, Christopher, my angel.
How are you?
Did you sleep well? Did you?
Run downstairs, get your breakfast,
and don't be late for school.
- Look after Christopher.
- OK.
If she doesn't like you...
...she can make you disappear.
- Should I send for more photographs?
- No, Miss Crawford.
The studio sent over a new batch.
We've got plenty.
You're all so gracious to help,
and you're doing a wonderful job.
And you!
I'll roll it to you this way.
Go get it, Christopher.
Come on, Christopher!
Christina! Christopher!
Damn it!
Carol Ann, I have asked you
to keep the children quiet today!
- Get them out of the garden!
- I'm sorry, Joan.
- Have Tina bring me up my coffee.
- All right, Joan.
I'm sorry, Mommie.
- I tried to be quiet. We were playing.
- And you forgot?
You promised last night.
You promised!
I told you how important
today is to Mommie.
I explained why, didn't I, Tina?
I'm sorry, Mommie.
Go to your room until I come for you.
You were very, very bad
to wake Mommie up like that,
very naughty.
I told you,
Mommie has to be beautiful today.
This afternoon
she has to see Mr Mayer.
Today is so important.
You are selfish and thoughtless.
You must learn
to think about other people.
You're bad, bad spoiled children.
My babies!
Someone stole both my babies.
That's good, darling.
They were thoughtless,
selfish, spoiled children.
Now they won't wake you up
when you need your rest.
- Good morning, Miss Crawford.
- Good morning, Ellen. Lovely blouse.
Thank you, Connie.
Joan...
Look at you. Look!
Eighteen years in the business,
and who can hold a candle to you?
- You're always so kind.
- Kind?
Of all my picture family,
who turned out best? Joan Crawford.
To all the new kids coming up,
she's like a diamond. Class.
- LB...
- Have I ever lied to you?
- Or given you one piece of bad advice?
- Never.
Never.
Your treatment of me has been divine.
You can do me a favour
that will be as big a favour for you
as it is for me.
You don't have to ask.
You only have to tell me.
Good. I want you to leave Metro.
Leave Metro?
Leave Metro?
Your pictures, one after another,
are losing money.
Theatre owners voted you
box-office poison.
For years I've paid no attention.
You know me, Joan.
I don't give up so easily.
We'll pay you off. But you can't afford
to make more losers for us.
It's the scripts, LB,
bad pictures, bad directors.
- Bad with you, good with others.
- Listen to me.
I have been begging you,
begging you for a good script.
I've always had some bad movies,
you knew I'd make them work.
- I can't keep doing it!
- Listen with your ears, not your pride.
With me,
feeling is more important than money.
You're a great star.
You're Hollywood royalty.
But styles change. You'll leave.
''We have creative differences.''
''We don't want to fight or argue,
because we love each other.''
Every studio will think
they're smarter than LB.
They'll try to finesse me.
You'll be offered one,
two, three, four, five films.
You may even get a hit.
Will you be sorry then?
I'm sorry now.
But here there's no confidence,
there's no hope. It's time for a change.
New faces, new voices,
a breath of fresh air. Who knows?
Don't do this to yourself.
I'll...
I'll have my maid and studio people
clear out my bungalow.
- I have a lot of years to collect.
- It's done, Joan.
They've packed your things.
They're loading your car.
You mean everybody already knows?
That we parted friends
because we didn't agree.
Will you walk me to my car?
Hollywood royalty.
Hollywood royalty!
We parted friends!
Everyone already knows!
Box-office poison!
Box-office poison!
Class...you're class...you're class!
Box-office poison!
- Wake up. Come on, children.
- What's happening?
Your mother wants you downstairs
in the rose garden.
You, too, Christopher.
Your mother wants you right away.
Eighteen years in the business!
And we parted friends!
Creative differences!
Good, I want some help here.
I want these branches cleared out.
Carol Ann and Christopher,
start clearing away all these branches.
Get the wheelbarrow and the rake.
Tina!
Bring me the axe!
Carol Ann, get some more emotion
into the scene.
I can't keep the emotion up
if you don't come in right away.
Let's... After the uniform,
downtown restaurants.
My mother, a common waitress!
I took the best job I could find, so you
could eat and have a place to sleep.
Do you have to degrade us?
- Don't say that!
- I'm not surprised.
You've never spoken of your people,
so perhaps it's natural.
Maybe that's why Father left.
I'm sorry I did that.
I'd have rather cut off my hand.
Your mother's been
practising and practising.
You know how perfect
she always wants to be.
Well, this time she must be perfect.
- Do you understand?
- She wants everything to be perfect.
This time it's even more important.
They're making your mother
take a screen test.
- Do you know what that is?
- When they're not sure they want you?
And you know how shameful
that is for her?
She wants this film.
She knows she's right.
She is this character, Mildred Pierce.
We have to help her.
We will, won't we?
I will. I will.
Christina,
you haven't touched your lunch.
- It's raw!
- It's rare, not raw.
- It's got this red juice when I push on it.
- Then don't push on it.
Darling, rare meat is good for you,
the doctor said so.
Christina, meat loses its vitamins
if it's overcooked.
I've had my vitamins this morning.
Pills!
She negotiates everything
like a goddamn Hollywood agent!
Christina...
...eat your lunch!
You are not getting up from this table
until you have finished that meat!
You may get up from the table now.
Just a minute, young lady!
Pick up that plate,
take it into the kitchen
and put it into the refrigerator.
I'm going out this evening.
You will have dinner in your room.
You will eat everything on that plate.
Do you understand?
You may drink your glass of milk, and
then you may be excused from the table.
Tina,
empty that plate into the trash can.
Why must everything be a contest?
The envelope, please.
And the winner is Ray Milland,
for The Lost Weekend.
God! I hate this night!
It turns every year into a crisis.
I wish I did have pneumonia.
I wish I was raging mad with the flu,
and a fever,
so I wouldn't have to even listen.
For the best female performance
in a leading role, the nominees are:
Ingrid Bergman,
for The Bells of Saint Mary's,
Joan Crawford, for Mildred Pierce,
Greer Garson,
for The Valley of Decision,
Gene Tierney,
for Leave Her to Heaven,
and Jennifer Jones,
for Love Letters.
You're going to win, I know it.
- The picture is a hit!
- Shh!
And the winner is Joan Crawford!
Oh, Mommie, you won!
Oh, Joan, listen to them!
They're so happy for you.
I would rather be here with you
than anywhere else in the world!
You, all of you here, and everywhere,
gave me this award tonight.
And I accept it from you, and only you.
I love all of you!
Now, please forgive me. Goodnight.
No wire hangers!
What's wire hangers doing
in this closet when I told you
no wire hangers, ever?
I work and work until I'm half dead,
and I hear people saying
she's getting old,
and what do I get?
A daughter...
...who cares as much
about the beautiful dresses I give her
as she cares about me!
What's wire hangers
doing in this closet?
Answer me!
I buy you beautiful dresses,
and you treat them like
they were some dishrag. You do!
A three-hundred-dollar dress
on a wire hanger?
We'll see how many
you've hidden over here. We'll see.
We'll see! Get out of that bed!
- All of this is coming out! Out!
- Please!
Out! Out!
We're going to see how many wire
hangers you've got in your closet.
Why? Why?
Christina, get out of that bed!
Get out of that bed!
You live in the most beautiful house
in Brentwood,
and you don't care if your clothes
look hunchbacked from wire hangers.
Mommie, don't! Mommie, stop!
And your room looks
like a two-dollar-a-week priced room
in some cheap little
backstreet town in Oklahoma!
Get up! Get up, clean up this mess.
Did you scrub the bathroom floor today?
Did you?
Yes, Mommie.
Yes, Mommie, what?
Yes, Mommie Dearest.
When I taught you to call me that...
...I wanted you to mean it.
Come here!
Look at this floor!
Do you call that clean? Do you?
Miss Jenkins said it was clean.
Miss Jenkins said it was clean.
Do you think it's clean?
Do you think it's clean?
- Look at that. Do you?
- Yes, I do.
Dirt on the floor. We're going to clean
this floor, you and me together.
Go! Scrub hard.
Scrub! Scrub, Christina!
- This floor's already clean.
- It's not!
This floor is not clean. Look at it!
It's not clean!
Nothing is clean.
This whole place is a mess!
Mommie!
Mommie, I don't understand.
Clean up this mess!
How?
You figure it out.
- I'll help you clean it up.
- No, go back.
Strap yourself in.
She'll kill me if she found out.
Jesus Christ!
No report on Christmas
would be complete
without a description of how one
Hollywood family spends this holiday.
So now, let us all
hop on our imaginary sleigh
and whisk away to the home
of one of America's foremost actresses,
Miss Joan Crawford.
We're so very happy
to have you with us.
- This is my daughter Christina...
- Hello, everybody!
- ...and my son Christopher.
- Hello!
All of America knows of your generosity
in adopting these homeless children.
And might I say to all of our listeners,
they're beautifully behaved.
Thank you. I feel that discipline
mixed with love
is such a good recipe.
Christina, do you and your brother
get lots of presents at Christmas time?
Yes, we do. Mother's fans
send us so many beautiful things,
but we like to share them with other
boys and girls who aren't so fortunate.
Could you tell us what will happen
after we leave you this evening?
We will probably watch
the Christmas tree lights.
Later, we'll welcome some
of their friends to help us sing carols.
And surely you'll finish up by reading
'''Twas the night before Christmas''?
No Christmas Eve
would be complete without that.
As a Christmas present to our listeners,
would you all like to say the last lines?
''And I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
''Merry Christmas to all
And to all a good night''
Goodnight and thank you for letting
us share your Christmas Eve.
And thank you, George, and
Merry Christmas to all your listeners.
Mommie's not quite ready yet,
Mr Gelber.
- Will it be scotch with ice tonight?
- Please, but easy with the scotch.
Easy. Easy on the scotch, Christina.
Mr Gelber,
I fix all my uncles' drinks this way.
I am not your uncle.
- Mommie, Mr Gelber is here.
- Very good, darling.
- Hello, Ted.
- Hello, Joan.
You can call him Uncle Ted.
Yes, Mommie Dearest, Uncle Ted.
See you later, Tina, darling.
- It's not good.
- You didn't like it?
No, it's not good!
- We have to find something wonderful.
- Everything here is just fine.
We've got company.
Tina?
I've brought you a freshener,
Mommie Dearest.
Thank you, Tina, darling.
That's quite
an extraordinary young lady.
Whatever I did, I won't do it again.
I promise! I can be better.
You'll see. The time'll fly by.
You can call me any time, collect.
Mrs Chadwick, how kind of you
to greet us. This is Christina.
- I know you'll be happy here, Christina.
- I won't.
Please don't make me stay.
- I don't want to leave home!
- No, darling. Now, listen to me.
You're not leaving home. You'll be
home some weekends and holidays.
What will Mrs Chadwick think?
I'm sure everything will be fine,
once you settle in.
I'll call you later, all right?
I understand just how you feel, Christina.
I understand.
Understand.
The first word I ever heard...
...out of any of you was that word...
...''understand''.
There'll be time enough to understand
when I'm old,
if I ever am old.
Oh, but not now.
That was great.
- That was great, Christina!
- Thank you.
- What play was that from?
- It's Antigone.
It's a Greek myth,
written by a French playwright.
Can I have your autograph
when you're a star?
- Darling, if I'm not too booked.
- Not too booked?
Miss Movie Star,
what is this, not too booked?
- Stop it, Tony.
- Yes, stop it.
Christina, do sit up properly.
Isn't this fun? Us having a date
on your weekend home from school?
- Charming hat, Christina.
- Thank you, Tommy.
I picked it out myself.
Don't flirt, Christina.
Tommy, we'll have
the New York steak for two, rare.
And two limestone salads.
- Thank you, Miss Crawford.
- Thank you, Tommy.
Tina, flirting can be...
...taken the wrong way.
Do you understand?
I want to show you something.
I got all As, one B.
- I'm very proud of you, Christina.
- Thank you.
Very proud.
And what about
your Christmas card list?
Christmas cards?
I've been studying for exams!
I'll get the cards out on time, OK?
Being away at school
has made you more rebellious.
I am not a baby any more.
Maybe you'd be better off at home.
I'm sorry.
- I have had a lot of schoolwork.
- Times are tough.
Still, I treat you to a lovely evening.
And I get smart-aleck back talk!
- I'm sorry, Mommie Dearest.
- It's all right.
I've had to let Helga go.
I need your help at home this weekend.
Let's have a lovely evening...
...shall we?
- You scared me!
- Sorry, Tina.
- How are you doing?
- OK.
- Finished?
- Almost.
Sit down, Tina. I want
to talk to you about something.
What did I do?
It's not you.
Tina, darling, I...
...I'm having some financial difficulties.
I just spoke to Mrs Chadwick.
She's agreed to let you go
on a work-scholarship programme.
That's all right.
We'll manage.
You know, I was
on a work-scholarship programme.
I worked my way through school
scrubbing floors.
Mostly work.
What is it?
There's something else.
I lost my contract at Warner's.
I don't feel I have anybody.
No contract.
No studio.
No money.
Tina, I don't know what I'm going to do.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
It'll be OK.
We'll manage.
I'm scared, Tina.
I'm scared!
After all those years!
I never thought it could happen to me.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't worry.
Mommie, I love you.
Mommie?
Mommie?
I came up to say goodnight to you.
Mommie?
Mommie?
Mommie!
Carol Ann! Carol Ann!
- Something's happened.
- What's the matter?
I came in, and I found her like this.
- I think she needs an ambulance.
- She doesn't need an ambulance.
She's drunk.
Come on, let's put her to bed.
- When did she buy all of these?
- Two days ago.
They were delivered this afternoon.
Come on, Joan. Get up, get up.
She told me we were broke.
Come on, help me!
Stop it! Help me, come on.
Come on, Joan.
Give me the pillow.
- Good, good.
- Lousy substitute...
...for someone who really cares.
Christina, darling.
- Christina, darling.
- Come on, Joan.
Christina, darling.
Sorry it has to be like this,
for you, for her.
Come on, Joan.
It all comes out in the washer.
It all comes out in the wash.
- Hi, Tony.
- Hi.
You handle that horse pretty well
for a lousy rider.
He's a great horse. Want to ride him?
- When?
- When you want to.
- I work all day.
- How about tonight? I'll go with you.
- What about Vera?
- She's just a friend.
- 8.30?
- Right here? OK.
OK.
- That's my first kiss.
- I'll bet.
Well, kinda.
- Swell! This is really swell.
- Vera?
I am going to tell.
I am. I am going to tell!
How could this happen?
How could you humiliate me?
I'm ashamed to be your mother.
How could you let this happen?
Both have been put on probation
and will have no privileges for a month.
Probation! I have devoted myself
to making her a proper young lady.
That boy should be expelled!
- When this has happened before...
- Before?
Is this an institution of learning,
or a teenage brothel?
Chadwick has
an impeccable reputation.
When students break the rules,
we curtail their freedom.
We are leaving. Obviously, she cannot
be controlled in this environment.
Nothing really happened.
It was innocent.
- No thanks to you!
- I think you're overreacting.
And I think you're under-reacting!
My compliments to your school
on its impeccable reputation.
Christina, come on!
There's a liquor store to the right.
I should have known you'd know
where to find the boys and the booze.
All right. Tina, look at me.
Barbara Bennett is here from New York
doing a cover story on me.
Tina, look at me...
when I'm talking to you!
This is very important to me.
I don't want any trouble from you!
- We're back.
- You're going to love this!
Movie star manages to have it all:
career, home and family.
Let me see that.
My God! Christina?
It can't be!
The last time I saw you, you were four.
- How are you, Miss Bennett?
- Call me Barbara.
They're teaching you some
fancy manners at Chadwick.
That's not all
they've been teaching her.
- How do you like school?
- Very much, thank you.
- She got expelled.
- That's a lie!
Excuse me, Barbara.
Christina, I want to talk to you...
in the other room!
- Why do you defy me?
- Why did you tell her I got expelled?
- Because you did get expelled!
- That is a lie!
You love it, don't you?
You love to make me hit you!
- Joan!
- Barbara, please.
Leave us alone, Barbara.
If you need anything, ask Carol Ann.
This is wonderful. This is wonderful!
You deliberately embarrass me
in front of a reporter!
A reporter! I told you how important
this is to me. I told you!
Why did you adopt me?
What?
Why did you adopt me?
Because I wanted a child.
Because I wanted someone to love.
Don't you act for me.
I wanna know!
Why did you adopt me?
Maybe I did it for a little extra publicity.
Tina, that's not true!
You know that's not true.
Maybe just a little true.
I don't know what to do with you.
- I don't know what to do with you.
- Why not?
I don't ask much from you, girl.
Why can't you give me
the respect that I'm entitled to?
Why can't you treat me
in the way I would be treated
by any stranger on the street?
Because I am not one of your fans!
- Mommie!
- You never loved me!
Mommie!
- Mommie!
- You've hated me!
You never loved me!
Never!
You've always taken and taken!
You never wanted to be my child!
You've always hated everything!
Everything! Everything!
Get out!
Dear Christina,
God has brought
you to our convent school
so that you can see
the error of your ways.
Your mother has told us how difficult
you've been, at home and at school.
She has requested
the strictest discipline for you.
There will be no privileges.
You're not to leave the school.
There will be no telephone calls
in or out,
no visitors, no mail.
You have sinned in the past,
transgressed against
the Holy Commandments,
but you shall find forgiveness here...
...and be cleansed.
Let us pray together
for your repentance.
The good Lord will grace you
with his comfort and guidance.
To Joan and Alfred,
a long and happy marriage.
Hear, hear!
Hold it! Look this way, please.
Thank you.
Alfred, darling, I'm so happy!
Speech! Speech!
Thank you all for being here
on such short notice.
If this marriage
comes as a surprise to some of you,
just think how I felt
when Joan said yes.
A few minutes ago,
a reporter asked me what I thought,
and how I would describe the marriage
between the soft-drink king
and the queen of Hollywood.
I told him I thought
it was a helluva match!
That's my Pally.
Pally, that's what he calls you
when he can't remember your name.
Don't let her kid you. I remember
her name. It's Mrs Alfred Steele.
- Right, Pally?
- Right!
Thank you, Sister...
...for being so good to me.
These years have been very hard.
Goodbye, dear child.
God be with you.
Thank you.
No, thanks. I can manage it. I'm OK.
Mommie?
I miss you, too, darling.
Yes, but you get to New York so often.
You know, we'll see each other there.
I've put the house up for sale.
Corporate headquarters
are in New York.
Darling, my daughter's here.
I'll talk to you before we leave.
Love to you, too.
Hello, Mother.
Christina,
I want you to meet my husband.
- What do I call him?
- What would you call your father?
Go introduce yourself. Go on!
Hi, Daddy. I'm Christina.
Hello, Arthur.
I don't know what to do. That bitch
of a bearing wall is blocking my view.
I'll tell you what to do.
Tear down
that bitch of a bearing wall
and put a window
where it ought it be.
Tina, what do you think?
It'll be great.
- Darling, coffee?
- Yeah, sure.
Tina, darling, coffee?
- So, you're acting?
- Yeah.
- Where?
- Mostly in stock.
- I think I may be pretty good.
- Good luck, darling.
I have been working nights, so I can
go on interviews during the day.
But the thing is, I...
...I was wondering if you could lend me
a little money, to get by this month.
Not a cent.
Joan, come on! A little something.
Doing things on your own is best.
Don't you agree, Tina?
Sure.
I'll get by.
Between us.
Now, the sofa... This is wonderful.
And this chair...
- That is my favourite, I think.
- It's mine, too.
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?
Al, look at this. It's perfect, except
for the colours. They're too strong.
- And I want you to look at these.
- I hate to bring this up, but...
...we're going to have to cut back
on the spending.
What are you talking about?
I'm doing this for you. I'm turning
this apartment into your showplace.
You're doing a marvellous job.
But we've got to economise.
Most of our expenses, including
this apartment, are for your company.
We have to look great for Pepsi-Cola.
I want us to look great
and us to live well, but there's a limit.
We're going into debt.
Al, you're a great businessman.
You and your company have found
a movie star to sell your soda pop.
- You've got to pay the price.
- Pally, be reasonable!
You've got everything you need.
Just look at this joint!
You are the genius
of the soft-drink world.
Get the goddamned company
to pay the bill!
Joan, you've got to understand,
it's a public company.
This isn't Hollywood.
This is the real world.
The real world expects us
to live in a certain way.
That way is breaking my back.
We'll find a solution.
You love a challenge.
OK, Pally.
The condolences of every person
at Pepsi-Cola are with you.
- Al Steele helped make this company.
- And you were by his side,
sharing the burdens and the joy.
And we want to give you ample time
to repay the debt,
plenty of time.
We'll have to take
the Fifth Avenue apartment.
You wouldn't want to
stay there alone, anyway.
What debt?
I've got 1 00,000 shares of stock.
Your husband had to borrow to pay
for the construction on your apartment.
We loaned him a considerable sum to
meet expenses his salary didn't cover.
You think you're very clever, don't you?
Trying to sweep
the poor little widow under the carpet.
Well, think again.
I'm on the board of directors
of this lousy company.
We assumed that you would
no longer want to be on the board.
Al and I helped build Pepsi
to what it is today.
I intend to stay with it.
We appreciate your devotion
and contribution, Miss Crawford.
But we have retired you
from the board of directors.
You drove Al to his grave, and now
you're trying to stab me in the back.
Forget it!
I fought worse monsters than you
in Hollywood. I can win the hard way!
We don't want any hard feelings.
You don't know what hard feelings are
until I come out publicly against your
product. You'll see how much you sell.
It's hardly necessary
to make threats you surely don't mean.
Don't fuck with me, fellas!
This ain't my first time at the rodeo.
You forget the press
I delivered to Pepsi was my power.
I can use it any way I want.
It's a sword,
cuts both ways.
The board has failed to realise the
extent of your interest in the company.
We...
...misjudged.
We shall be pleased
to have you stay on.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Now, let's get to work.
Coming.
Mommie.
- Hello, Tina, darling.
- I wish I had known you were coming.
I just happened to be
in the neighbourhood.
I would have straightened up a little bit.
It looks quite neat to me.
Jesus Christ!
I'd forgotten what it was like.
Sit down.
- How are you, Tina?
- Been making rounds.
A lot of rejections,
but I'm up for a part.
- Good!
- It's a soap opera.
It's very good experience.
- Have you got a glass, darling?
- Yeah.
You know where I got this from?
Batista himself.
When I opened the plant
outside Havana.
- That's all they gave you?
- That's it.
Cheap bastards!
- Do you miss all that?
- I miss Al more.
So, how are the guys?
Guys are guys. It hasn't changed.
I brought you a gift.
Thank you, Mommie.
They were the first present
that Al ever gave me.
They're beautiful.
I want you to have them.
Thank you.
Tina...
...if you don't get this part,
for Christ's sake, don't hock 'em.
Oh, I wouldn't.
Thank you, Mommie.
- Don't be a stranger.
- No.
- Four o'clock yet?
- It's five after.
Five after! Turn the set on, now!
I want that set on every day
at four sharp.
I'm going to try to make him happy.
You know, in every way.
You two make a lovely couple.
I want so much to be a good wife.
- You will be.
- But there's so much to learn.
Don't worry. Love conquers all, right?
You're so good to me, Susan.
You're so understanding.
How's your mother doing?
You know Mom. She's been
secretly planning this for years.
You're in good hands, then.
Sometimes I feel like it's her wedding.
But Bruce is being good,
although I know he feels very
far removed from all the planning.
She's doing quite well, don't you think?
She's improving.
A lot of fans have written
how impressed they are with Christina,
and how proud
you must be of her acting.
Well, something good had to rub off.
Come on, let's get to work.
Mommie!
Miss Crawford?
I'm Belinda Rosenberg, Christina's
producer. Thank you for calling us.
- How is she?
- She'll be fine.
It was an ovarian tumour,
but completely benign.
It's a rotten break for her. This won't
affect her job in any way, will it?
- How long will she be here?
- The doctor's not sure yet.
Tell you what, let me call you tomorrow.
We'll discuss it.
- Please.
- Good.
Your show's on.
Don't you want to watch?
To see how well
they manage without me?
To see your mother.
They announced your mother is going
to stand in for you until you're well.
She can't.
My character's only 28 years old.
Could you...
Could you call...
- You want me to call Cindy for you?
- Yes.
You know, she wants to...
I know she wants
to have an affair with Robert.
But are you sure his divorce is final?
His divorce is final?
Fade...and out!
- Miss Crawford, are you all right?
- Fine, just nervous as hell.
- Give me a drink and I'll be all right.
- We've only got another 90 seconds.
You just keep finding those cue cards.
That's the problem. The cue cards are
too low. Tell them to bring them higher.
- I think that's where I went wrong.
- Right. Are you all right?
OK, go.
You look perfect.
In ten, please.
Nine, eight...
...three, two, one.
Now, what about us...
...about our situation?
- Maybe we should elope.
- No!
- Absolutely not!
- I was afraid of that.
Be serious now, Bill. Mother and I
have to make plans today.
I was serious. Think of all the work
it will save your mother.
Mom loves every minute of it.
Don't you have any more
romantic ideas?
A small, simple ceremony.
It'll be grand.
Turn it off. Turn it off.
Come on in.
- Here's what your mother picked out.
- Let me take that from you.
My God, Carol Ann.
She's still picking out clothes for me!
She went to such lengths
to pick out the right colours.
Well, I hope it fits.
It is pretty, pretty colours.
Carol Ann, let me get you
a cup of tea, or something.
Carol Ann?
Carol Ann? What is it?
Oh, Christina.
What's the matter?
Your mother is going to be
so alone when you leave.
Don't you worry.
She'll be all right.
She always is.
Hello?
Yes, Mommie.
No, she's here.
Mommie, I told you.
I want to do it for you.
As the final event
of this prestigious evening,
we bestow our organisation's
highest award of merit
upon a woman known not only as
an Academy Award winning actress,
but also as a businesswoman
held in high regard
for her charitable,
civic and professional contributions.
It is an honour for me to present
this award of recognition
to a truly great lady,
Miss Joan Crawford.
With us tonight to accept the award
on behalf of her mother
is Miss Crawford's daughter, Christina.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's a privilege to be with you tonight,
to accept this honour, this award,
on behalf of my mother, Joan Crawford.
When I spoke with her, she asked me
to convey her deepest gratitude.
She wanted so much
to be here in person tonight.
But she was simply not well enough.
I know she would
want me to say thank you
to each and every one of you
who made this honour possible.
And on a more personal note...
...I would like to say directly to her...
...congratulations!
And...
...I love you...
...Mommie Dearest.
Thank you so much.
Oh, Mommie.
I always loved you so.
It's over...
...the pain.
There's no more pain.
You're free.
You're free!
Oh, Mommie!
Mommie!
Oh, Mommie.
Christopher.
I'm so glad you're here.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
- You?
- OK.
- Did you meet David, my husband?
- Yeah.
- Let's go out, get some air.
- OK.
Miss Crawford, I've always
been such a fan of your mother's.
I do hope you feel
we've done her justice.
I worked from my own personally
autographed photo of your mother.
You did a beautiful job.
She looked lovely.
Thank you.
Christina, Christina!
My little Tina.
She always loved you...
...so very much, Christina.
I need to believe that.
I need so much...
...to be able to believe that now.
She did.
Here it is.
This is the section
pertaining to you and Christopher.
It is my intention
to make no provision herein
for my son, Christopher...
...and my daughter, Christina,
for reasons
which are well known to them.
What reasons?
Jesus Christ!
As usual, she has the last word.
Does she?
Does she?
