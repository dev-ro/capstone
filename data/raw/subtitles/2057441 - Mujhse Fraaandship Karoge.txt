waiting for the changes...

small change in the chorus
i'll see you after the show...
kill it rahul! See you...
why does it feel like
all my dreams are on
ajourney that never ends
my uncertain heart is mute
tied scared and does not say
what it wants to say
like an untethered cloud
a lost scrap of a soul
swirls in a
whirlpool of wants and needs
leaving bits of my
stort scattered around
the sky seems to be filled
with clouds that go nowhere
like dreams without substance
but still i dream on, i dream on
dreams like hot air balloons
all talk and no
weight float away from me
confusion flecks the eyes
rises like smoke
and clouds our lives
but i have hope
there will come a day
we will know who we are
and where we are going
and it will all begin to make sense
till then the sky seems to be filled
with clouds that go nowhere
like dreams without substance
but still i dream on, i dream on
all right!! Damn cool...
thanks bro...

Have you ever sent a friend
request on facebook to anyone?
Sure... to friends

- Why?
She'd accept it!
Wow the fringe benefits of
being a rockstar in the univ!
Look at him

but check out his popularity rating!
Hey hey! If only people knew
that you write all my songs
you'd be as much of a rage
in the university i'll bet.
You insane? I'm
battling a goddamn recession
where females are
concerned in my life as it is
and if they get to know i write
your pansy songs? They'll run!!
You idiot! You'll score instead!!
Look at me!
Rxactly!
- Look at you!
Rven if you go up on stage
and sing the cow is my mother...
it's a milch animal,
white in color...
girls are still gonna
tear their clothes off
while screaming 'rahul
rahul rahul'! - Good point!
There are times when i'm
tempted to tear my clothes off...
too while screaming out his name,
'rahul rahul rahul'!
I'm gonna tear my shirt
i'm gonna be your fan
your turn bro! With the letter 'k'
night eyes... your night eyes...
the moon sleeps
inside those night eyes
your eyes... your
eyes... your night eyes
stop stop stop... right here...

- See you!
It's damn late. Will

It's frigging insane man!
- Are you serious? 3d porn?
Impressed aren't ya?
Screw the hostel!
Let's go back to your place

child his parents have!
Lets go bro... no one
needs us here anymore!
I'm gonna tear my shirt

be on the tip of our
tongues as well now!
Rnough!
Just look at her

Looks pretty normal to me.
What's so great about her?
You're just jealous.
Oh please... i know at least
three girls better looking than her!
Then why on earth don't you
ever introduce them to me?
To a psycho like you? Forget it!
Just look at the
way she talks to me!
Show some respect neha
i'm your brother,
older brother at that!
15 minutes older... it
doesn't count, right vishal?
Don't involve me guys...
evert time i look at the
sibling love that you two share
i feel like thanking
my parents for...
...producing
precisely one child... me!
Hey you!
- Oh shit! Machoman!
You... damn you... i'm going to...
hey
machoman... leave him! Let him be!
Don't call me machoman!!
Sorrt sorrt
satyavrat... satyavrat...
you should be thanking hacky!
You crazy? Thank him?
Hell i'm going to kill him!
Listen if hacky hadn't
shared your video...
you've would've been
invisible forever despite your size!
Really?
- Of course!
Look at those
girls... they're all checking you out!
Half the job's done buddy...
it's just a question of losing
a couple of kilos and you're set!
They'll pounce on you
- pounce on me?
You bet! All over you!!
Think about it...
i dream on...
i dream on...
nice song guys!
Hey... mogambi
who? Oh this late entrt...
y'know the difference
between mogambo and this one?
Mogambo's sour face would
at least break into a...
smile at the sight of
anil kapoor's hairt chest
but this grump, never shows
her teeth unless it's to snarl!
Henna ceremony... garland exchange...
iovely!
Where did you click these?
- My sister's wedding
who's this?
My aunt from meerut
have you seen the anand
photo lab next to the college?
Yes of course - great.
Why don't you take these there?
What do you mean?
I mean that i recruit photographers
for the photography club...
real photographers
if i want someone to click
snaps for my cousin's wedding...
i'll definitely call you!
Y'know you have no
respect for talent!
I know why you're not taking
me into the photography club!
Oh yeah?
- Lrsbian!!
What!?!
Oh my god! Preity's a lesbian??
No way babe! I don't think she
can make it with a girl either...
i'm gonna trt and make out with her!
What a slap...
wow
he's right you know.
- Preity's a lesbian?
No she doesn't let any guy become
part of the photography club
she's allergic to guys
she's a male repellent.
Just like a mosquito repellent!
Smartass!
- Wow... house full today huh?
Hi ma'am... good morning mam...
hi people... wish i'd see this kind
of attendance in class as well!
Ma'am if you take evert class,
i swear i'll show up for each one!
Ok guys down to work
now you all know that founders
day is just 3 months away...
yes ma'am...
how many of you know...
that it coincides with the
25th anniversart of our college?
Really? Oh yeah?
We didn't know that...
so we need to put up a kick ass show
something new, exciting and
totally totally different... ideas!
Ma'am lets do a play!
Shake it shakespeare! A play...
coming from dramatics... how original!
Mohit think of something else
look guys 25th anniversart
silverjubilee of this college
so think of something unique...
...to the college
something that defines it
photography... any ideas?
Ma'am
we could showcase the histort of
the college through photographs...
like a special coffee table book?
What's your problem??
It's boring. What're
you going to have in it?
Photographs of past
principals and faculty?
We need to fix on an angle
just a minute
i didn't ask for a vote yet
ideas first arguments later
and vishal, for someone
who has such a strong opinion
you must be having an idea as well?
Possibly better than preity's?
Rvert college has its
share of romances and breakups
but some couples... they last forever
i'm sure that there
must've been several romances
that took off right
here at bunkers point...
in the canteen,
corridors, librart, auditorium...
...that ended up in marriage
what if we were to find 25 such
couples and do something with them...
you know?!
Hah! Filmy!
Okay... that's kind
of sweet, romantic...
anyone else?
Ma'am vishal's idea is quite sweet
we could do a play on that idea!
Yeah like a
musical... with songs etc!
Nats... what else is a musical??
Vishal you're too funny man!
Pipe down you rascal pipe down
okay lets have the votes please
preity's idea?
No one!!
Vishal's idea?
Ok so we're going to use vishal's
idea... along with preity's...
that's really cool ma'am... nice one!
A photographic documentart on the
romantic histort of the college.
Yeah that's nice... awesome!
What're you doing?
All right clear out
now... get started...
we don't have too much time
left... dramatics stay back please...
lets see what we can
do with you guys...
thanks preity, thanks vishal...
what is it?
- There's a problem.
I don't wanna work with a
grump like you. Back out!
Rxcuse me?
Tell ms. Raghubir you don't
want to work on this. - What?!
Pretty slow huh? Tell ma'am you
don't want to work on this project.
Why should i tell her? If you
don't want to do it, you tell her.
Hey didn't you hear what she said?
Really sweet and romantic idea?!
You have absolutely no
clue what romance is about,
so here's my advice to
you... don't bother getting involved!
Hello! I've no interest in working
with you either, on your stupid idea!
So that's what i'm saying...
back out!
Umm... never mind!
Don't worrt, i never mind!!
Baby doll...
why are you trting
to kill the ice cream?
Not the ice cream,
that bloody creature in college.
What's his face? Vishal! I hate him!
You hate all guys!
But this one's special!
You've been in this
college... what 3 months?
And you've already found
someone special enough to hate? Wow!
Stop trting to be funny! I
don't like people who act funny!
I take it this guy vishal is funny?
No! He thinks he is funny!
And people around him constantly
encourage him for no bloody reason!
How?
- By laughing.
Oh my god vishal, you're so funny!
Oh god... who are these people who
send friend requests to strangers?!
Full despo types
i mean... i don't know them at all!
I want to be friends
with you baby, add me! Ugh!
Sumit... nah!
Vishal... no!
Huzefa... definitely no!
Uday... please!
Jayesh? No way!
Oh my god!
- What is it?
There's a friend request from rahul!
Who's rahul?
- Rahul, the univ rockstar!
Remember the singer
who pulled me on stage...
...at the rock show the
other night! - Really? Lemme see!
Nice!
But pree...
malu, stop being so modest!
Look at evertone around
you... they're all your fans!
He had to groove with you on
stage once... and now he's your fan!
Bull shit!
- Oh c'mon malu!
There are just two kinds of
people in this world- the ones...
who don't know you and
the others who adore you!
Hah hah! Funny! Anyway, ignore!
But why?
What do you mean why? - He's
probably the hottest guy around...
what an awesome singer and hell,
his writing's even better!
Yeah i guess that's no
reason why you'd accept...
...his friend request, right?
Don't do it...
go ahead, delete him!
You know, i used to find him
pretty cool earlier, but not anymore
i mean, how desperate and uncool...
to approach a girl
like this on facebook!
No way!
Hi girls!
- Hi ma!

Yes aunty. How was work?
Madly hectic!

No way aunty! Rvert guy i
know can't be my boyfriend!
Preity, is he your boyfriend?
What's wrong with you mom?!
He's the rock star of
the entire university!
How could he possibly be my boyfriend?
- Why not? My baby prettiest!
Your baby's best friend prettiest!
It's just my name that's preity!
God i just don't
know who you take after!
Definitely not you.
But presenting exhibit a!
She definitely takes after you
you know... she
should've been your daughter.
Then you would've been happy!
- You're right!
But now that i'm stuck
with you... i'll manage...
good night arunima!
Yes, i'm leaving!
I have a con call in half
an hour, so keep it low!
Aye aye captain!
Clean your room!
Okay!
- Oh god, arrgh!
You're so lucky!
Why!
- Your mom is always around you!

able to get at each other...
so get out and sort it out now.
Bloody liar!
Pretty dumb... pretty weird...

...as good as a cheap
mills and boon novel get it?!
Vishal's so mean!
As though she didn't bite him back?
She was totally asking for it

whisper something, anything
silly, sweet, stupid, bright
so say what do you want to say
my heart is having a

Of course, for you!
I liked her, for you

Actually, just my type!
You like him!

Like like or lust like?
First you send me to meet him...

so do tell us, when did
you meet each other? And how?
Well... we were
classmates... and she was hot!
He was the class
topper... and a total nerd!
Never ever spoke to me!
Really?
So how did you fall in
love with each other?
Well... for three whole years,
he just stared at me
whoa... you were always
surrounded by other guys
i didn't even know if
you'd ever noticed me!
You were scared,
that's what you were!
And you were so pretty!
I didn't dare to dream that
you'd ever even look at me!
One day, under the
pretext of having a cup of tea,
i asked him to meet
me at bunkers point...
and straight away asked him
why do you keep staring at me?
I was taken aback
i quickly said that it's one of
my friends who's attracted to you
so then i told him right away...
to tell his 'friend' that
i was attracted to him as well!
What if there was a friend for real?
Go on kid... click more
of hers, she's beautiful!
Sure!
Just a moment, do i look alright?
Yes!
Please do send us a copy
of these photographs...
sure ma'am. I'll email them to you
- okay
it's not just you who's
working on this project!
I'm part of it as well get it?!
This project is about love.
Totally beyond your understanding
as though you know a lot about love
you just know how to love yourself!
At least i love myself.
You don't even do that!
I mean, look at you!
Shabby clothes...
unkempt hair! Disgusting!
I don't need to look pretty,
i'm intelligent!
That is the dumbest
thing i've ever heard!
Pretty idiotic huh?!
Are you waiting for an
invite to start this rickshaw?
Come on let's go!
Madam i think you'll have
to take another rickshaw
mine's out of gas
- what on earth is wrong with you?!
I've been sitting
here for an hour now...
couldn't you just tell me earlier?
As if you ever asked me? You
just came and plonked yourself!
Arrgh! City full of fools!
Oh great!
Awww. Baby's rickshaw broke down?
Haww... pretty unlucky huh!
Bye!
So?
So?
How was it?
What?
Coffee? How was the coffee date?
Great
great... great?
Yeah. Plain and simple great!
And?
What?
Me?
Just my type!
Oh!
Shall we meet again?
- Shall we meet again?
When?
Tonight! It's saturday night!
Tonight? Shit! Shit shit shit!
Rrr...
am busy... going
clubbing with a friend!
That's cool. Get her along...
in fact, i'll
bring a friend as well.
Velvet lounge at 10?
Great.
Hey how do i look?
Bro, how does it matter?!
It does!
Clothes... okay, hair... too much gel?
Too much desperation!
Hah! Look who's talking
about being desperate!
Have you ever managed to
score with a girl yet?
No. But just see how cool i am
that i'm still not desperate!
Shut up bitch! Rahul come
on... we're running late!
I'm not going. I'll drop you there
are you insane?!
Why? What's the point? You
want to meet him... you go ahead!
He wants to meet you, not me!
I've met her once already!
Is she that ugly that
you can't meet her again?
She's not ugly... and that's
why i don't want to meet her
what if i end up with her,
instead of you?!
Jerk!
And in any case, if both of us
show up, who's going to talk to him?
You or me?
Me. No you. I mean me.
We'll see when we get there!
Listen preity, you should just
meet him as yourself. Not...
as me. I think he'll fall for you...
in any case, when she finds
out that you are not me...
and that it's actually me who's
me and whatever i say as you...
i actually say as me...
she'll still think that it's you
who is saying it and not me...
what the hell am i saying?!
I think you're high. All that
cologne you doused yourself in...
buzz off dude. I'm not going!
Vert good
idea! Should i go instead?
Asshole! Should i just kill you?!
Let's throw him out of the car!
Right here right now!
Please, please,

Okay! Fine! On one condition though

Friends its 4 am and if
you're awake right now...
listening to this show, then trust
me, you're afflicted with love...
cause love is on air with rj seema.
The sky is our slate
just grab a passing cloud,
a drop of sunshine or two
and write me a message
i am a little clueless
how to give you the news
that everything i
think seems brand new today
our conversations are taking flight
leaping into the light
slipping and sliding away
uh oh uh oh what just happened
uh oh uh oh i think it's called love
uh oh uh oh i think it might be true
i guess i've fallen in love
i look for excuses to find you
in different places
in strangers' faces
the books i read
the tales they tell
are now all about you
our conversations are taking flight
leaping into the light
slipping and sliding away
uh oh uh oh what just happened
uh oh uh oh i think it's called love
uh oh uh oh i think it might be true
i guess i've fallen in love
just like that without a warning
my talkative heart wants to
make unbreakable
promises if you look this way
we could talk about
how silly i'm being
for the first time
without a warning
my roundabout heart
is talking in riddles
if you give me a chance
we could solve them together
i dream about dreaming up
dreamy meetings with you
i dream about the this and the
that that i could be talking with you
just waiting and wishing that
our conversations will flight
leaping into the light
slipping and sliding away
uh oh uh oh what just happened
uh oh uh oh i think it's called love
uh oh uh oh i think it might be true
i guess i've fallen in love
uh oh uh oh what just happened
uh oh uh oh i think it's called love
uh oh uh oh i think it might be true
i guess i've fallen in love
hey kissi wissi...
you!
Uh duh! Hey you looked like you
were gonna kiss me two seconds ago!
Dream on romeo
i don't like nightmares!
But hey, if you wear
clothes like this evert day...
like a cutesy ditsy girly girl...

Listen you skunk

Oh yeah? You think its hacky then?
No i'm mean it's just not

Don't be silly! I still need
to top up my phone card...
...pay off my canteen bill...
and this, this is my
new credit card...

She was the most irritating girl in
the entire college, she was! - Really?
And god knows what he
thought of himself! So arrogant!
And what about you? As though you
were a quiet meek one! Look at her!
And then?
We just kept fighting
through college for three years
then on the last day
it suddenly hit me that
i would never see her again,
never quarrel with her again...
she's cute eh? - Yes sir...
and then i proposed...
as we fought...
well i said yes finally, didn't i?
- Thanks for the favour sweetheart!
Oh god, you think you're so funny!
- Hello! I am funny!

between the two, i mean look at you

hacky
rahul

I think i've got immense style...

following you around.
Shopping alone?
Yeah just doing some
research for a new project.
I'm working on a new collection.
I get it! This is where you
steal your fashion ideas from.
Shhh don't tell anyone.
Hey d'you want to grab a bite?
I'm kind of hungrt.
Chelsea? Don't tell me!
They changed their managers
six times in the last ten years
i mean they threw out mourinho!
Chelsea? Really?!
Hello dear, did you sleep well?
Oh my god, what's wrong with you?
Are you insane?!
Look at him! He's staring at us!
So what happened the other night?
You just disappeared.
Preity wanted to go home, so
i left as well to drop her.
Didn't she tell you?
She did... but she also said...
...that you were planning
to come back to the club.
What happened?
You got bored with vishal?
Not possible
he's quite entertaining -great guy
what did you think of preity?
Sweet
i wonder
what?
Nah. Nothing. - Tell me. Come on.
No i was just thinking. What if i
hadn't sent you that friend request.
Would we have met?
Sure we would. I think. We would've
met through friends perhaps
or maybe here,
while watching a match!
You would've been cheering for chelsea
while i was rooting for man u
then we would've argued
about which team's better!
And then i would've
bought you a drink
to make up, you know?
And then i would've
said hi i'm malvika
and i would've said
hi malvika i'm rahul
so rahul... what do you do?
Well i've been rooting for man u
all this while but now i think
i'll start cheering
for chelsea. And you?
I'll still be rooting for chelsea!
So who are you? Apart from being
chelsea's new manager that is...
malvika kelkar

completed school in singapore

No sweat. I have my ways

The whole day went by
without us talking. I missed you.
He missed me? He missed me!
I thought of you at exactly the
same time that you thought of me
say about 5 minutes ago?
Malu! I'm so happy!
Do you want some
cold coffee? - Yes please
with some ice cream?
Yes thanks -great
malvika's asking for a favour.
Malvika! And you're actually
considering not helping her?

Vishal?
Late again. Hacky where
the hell is your buddy?
If he doesn't hand me the
write ups when he's supposed to...

make the layouts on time??
Chill... give him a break
there're tons of interviews
that he's got to work on...
and then we went to
kanheri caves yesterday...

kanheri caves?
Vishal and you?!
Yeah. So?
Hey guys! Neha the articles!
I told you!
Thanks... - hey
preity... shall we go grab a coffee?
Let's go!
Vishal and mogambi?!
No seriously... you
haven't met my mom yet!
She's perfect... beautiful,
talented...
she runs her own publishing house
that's cool. What's it called?
Tagore. - What're you saying?!
I'm reading a book right now
that's published by them...
it's by this young
upcoming bright writer.
Let me check. One sec.
Sole to soul.
Nice huh?
What's up? You didn't like the book?
No... i don't like the writer.
Siddhant shekhar.
You know the guy?
Long boring stort
i like stories.
Boy meets girl. Girl
falls in love with the boy.
Boy uses her to get
his book published.
Girl's heart is broken.
Blah blah blah blah...
then the girl moves
to another college.
One more guy shows up and
gets under her skin... big time.
You're right. Long boring stort...
smile.
- What're you doing?!
You're a strange photographer...
you ought to know i'm
taking your picture! - Stop it!
Pretty photogenic huh?
Rubbish!
- So. No boyfriend?
No, not interested.
Lesbian?! - No!!!
There must be someone
that you're interested in...
what's the point? As
though he's going to like me!!
Hey hey hey... if you trt
hard... he might like you...
my own father didn't want me.
The day i was born he left
you probably think that even
global warming is happening
'cause of you... right?!
Now that you mention
it... it's quite possible
you're such an idiot!
Where're your
brains for god's sake?!!
Hey just because you bought me coffee
doesn't mean you can walk all over me!
Mogambi!
Tommy! - Why don't you
tear all my hair out?
I could take you
waxing... less painful...
me? Stranger? What
about you? Invisible.
Invisible? Nah just busy...
what?
I don't get it. I just don't get it.
Our chats have suddenly changed.
It's like... she's not
interested in me anymore.
So damn weird
stop pmsing like a girl...
she must be busy or something.
Forget it.
No man... we used to be
on chat a hell of a lot.
All right! Hey look...
your real profile is sweeter
than your facebook profile
i'll see you later okay?
Hey machoman!
You're welcome!
For?
You forgot to thank us bro...
oh shit... actually you know,
that day i told you
i liked her and then you
sent her that friend request...
but after that i didn't get
a reply from her for weeks
then i thought really hard
i mean, what's the point in lying
about yourself on chat or on the net?
It's best to just tell the
truth and be yourself, face to face
so that's what i did
at first she laughed... then
started talking to me gradually
she said she liked my honesty
now you sneaky bugger
be honest with me...
are you guys buddies
buddies or buddies buddies??!!
Hacky you're so sick man!!
It's your birthday this
saturday and you're throwing a party!
Rr no. - Yes
why? - Dude i've wasted
too much time already
i want to tell malvika the truth
i want to tell her i love her
that definitely
calls for a party. Done!
Thanks buddy
come on editorial team hurrt up!!
Sorrt sorrt we're late guys...

What're you doing? Stop it...
bootilicious!
Hey booty girl! Up here!
Can i be your ken?
Hey booty trap!
Hey booty can i be your beast?!!
The booty of
youth... booty booty booty!
Bootilicious!
Did you see the text?
It kinda flashes!!
Oh my god...
the booty of
youth... booty booty booty!
Preity! Preity...
what? Preity please listen... wait!
Did you do this?
Obviously. - What is wrong with you?
It's ajoke vishal
not funny dude. She's really upset!
Who cares? She so uptight anyways
anyone would be upset! I'm a
booty girl?! What the hell??
Okay, and what about the stunt you
pulled on machoman... his video...
what about that?
Stop being so bloody
sentimental suddenly!
You go right now and
tell her you did this!
You must be out of your mind...
you want her to know?
Then you tell her!
Pree... hey preity!
There's a new message from
rahul... you didn't read it?
Didn't find the time. Read it aloud.
What if it's personal?
Okay... saturday's yours,
birthday's mine,
the party's for you,
the beers for me,
the time is 10.30,
the venue is my house.
Ps. Bring preity, your friend,
my photographer.
Hey sounds like fun!
Pree?
What's up with you?
Nothing
that vishal...
vishal again? I thought
you guys were friends finally
that's what i thought as well...
but i was wrong
they're all the
same... how could i forget?
Rahul's not the same
i know! On the net and
chat he's one person
and in real life he's
like someone else...
it's almost like
he's not the same person
what're you trting to say?
I don't know... he's boring!
What?
I mean... really?
Does that mean you're not
interested in him anymore?
Maybe not
actually... you know what?
I know i'm not interested in him.
So... what if someone
else was interested?
Who? One of his college fans?
No... just... anyone...
malu?
I'm really sorrt!
For what? - I think i like him!
Rvert time we met, we hit it off,
but i thought you liked him so...
you funny girl you!
Why didn't you tell me earlier??
- How could i?
I thought you liked him!
If i hadn't said anything you would've
done a filmy sacrifice like this??
I guess...
malu you idiot...
i liked rahul as a concept...
i fell for his songs...
his writing... not him as a person
the only connection between me
and rahul was a broadband one.
Hail mother preity!
May you be blessed with a
hundred boyfriends my dear!!
You sure?
Of course i'm sure! I'm
not as benevolent as you are!
Hey so can we go to
his birthday party then?
Malu you go...
pree... i did so much for you...
now it's your turn... please please
please don't say no, don't say no...
god you little
mongrel... fine we'll go!
Thank you! How's the party going?
Rocking! Hey preity...
happy birthday!
Thank you so much!!
How're you? - Good!
Hey vishal
hi... hey preity
i'm going to go get a drink.
Preity... preity...
preity listen please...
leave me alone
listen preity i -don't
want to talk to you.
Preity it wasn't
me... just listen to me...
go tell her for god's sake!
What? You want me to
propose to malvika?!
You're already
pretending to be rahul...
and now you want me to pretend
to be you?! Are you crazy?!!
Not malvika you ass! Preity!
Go tell her it was you who made
that booty mms and uploaded it
she's not talking to me dude
so? You came here to
chat up malvika, not preity!
And what about all these
people drinking free booze...
...that poor rahul's paying for!
Don't think so much.
You're not used to it!
Just do what you came here to do!
Talk to malvika
here have a shot... go on!
Best of luck!
Hi this is preity,
leave me a message...
and if it's vishal, stop calling me.
You're such an ass
preity this ass has
something to say to you
hey i'm not an ass you are!!
Shut up hacky the tacky!
Really guys, why don't you save
this sibling rivalrt for later?
Hey...
its nothing major but...
chicken!
Preity that booty
mms doing the rounds?
Hacky made it and
circulated it, not vishal.
You're just protecting him.
- Why would i do that?
Because he's your friend.
News flash! Hacky's my brother.
Unfortunate but true.
You're such an ass!
Yuck... no vodka in this!
Hey...
what?
I thought you were pissed off
i still am
what's wrong with you?
Couldn't you tell me earlier that you
didn't make that video or upload it?
In case you didn't notice,
i was trting to...
but you didn't give me a chance!
So? Trt harder. You know me...
i'm like that
that's true. Mogambi

You totally screwed my happiness!
Serves you right!
I need a beer. You want one?

what the... what
the hell is going on?
You know i like
malvika... and despite that you
what kind of a friend are you
rahul? - One second one second...
you, me... when did this happen?
It's been a while. In fact, malvika
i'm sorrt, i should
have told you ages ago
the friend request on facebook
from rahul, i sent it, from his id
all those conversations, that
connection, it was with me malvika
no. - What?
Malvika wasn't chatting with anyone
what do you mean? I have proof
ask rahul... there
are tons of messages
not from malvika. Me
what? I don't understand... i... what?
I should've known... that you
would've done something like this
i can't believe that all this while,
i was talking and chatting with you
pretty funny huh? And me?
Pretty dumb
you must've had a good laugh huh?
Making a fool out of someone?
Whoa whoa... you made a fool
of me as well, don't forget!
Trust me. If i'd known that
i was communicating with you
i would've never
continued writing to you!
Well same here!
I don't know how i
could've been so stupid...
as to suddenly start
thinking well of you!
I was better earlier,
when i didn't trust anyone
of all the people, i trusted you!
You're not the only one in
this godforsaken situation!
Why're you playing the solo victim
here? - I'm not playing victim here
but you're behaving like
one -just shut up vishal
what's wrong with you...
why're you overreacting
because like a fool
i was falling in io...
pree...
preity...
preity...
coffee?
I know you're angrt
you have no idea.
- Do you? What?
Have any idea what you're doing?
I'm not kissing my best
friend's girlfriend for sure
malvika's not your girlfriend.
Sure... she found rahul the rock star
fine i will... but i've
got a question for you
you had a party for
malvika last night...
but you kept chasing
preity all through the party
because she was upset!
So it was more important to make up
with preity than to win over malvika
what're you most angrt about?
That preity...
who cares about preity man?
You! All the while that
she was angrt with you
you were walking
around like you were
a part of the return
of the zombie part 2
and soon as you guys made up,
your batteries got super charged!!
Bullshit! Stop with this
freudian nonsense and forget preity
why did you kiss malvika huh?
I like her. And she likes me
more importantly malvika
told me everything... the truth
and that's the key word 'truth'
you love someone,
be honest with them
and that's what malvika did,
told me that
all this while preity was writing
and communication from her id
you were talking to preity
this whole time, not malvika
your connection was
with preity, not malvika
got that?
Food for thought
vishal where the hell are you?
Raghbir's been looking
for you! Hurrt up...
vish, i need your help to
sort out these badges...
god this is never going to get over!
Hey preity hurrt up!
Been waiting for you for ages!
Vishal
how many copies have
you made of the dvd?
'Cause raghubir wanted a backup
preity
yeah listen do a sound check please,
the levels might be off after the play
i'll see you
backstage in an hour? Bye...
you know its okay
it's not your fault
you did exactly what i did
i totally
overreacted at the party...
it's just that i fell for you
actually fell in love with you
don't worrt, it's not
your problem or your fault
it's just me. Obviously you
love malvika... who wouldn't.
And you know me... stupid, mogambi
i end up doing silly stuff...
randomly, tactlessly.
This whole love thing as well,
without thinking
so basically what i'm
saying is, no stress
just ignore everything.
I'll get over it
it's my problem. I'll deal with it
we cool?
Chill...
love...
is as much a part of
college as bunking...
unpaid canteen bills,
proxy or sleeping in class
so tonight we're going to
talk about 25 love stories
that began right here in
college and are still going strong
vishal...
vishal...
vishal!! Hacky! What is going on?
I don't know ma'am...
did you change something in
the order of things... no ma'am
some people fell in
love at first sight...
and some people took three
years to realize their feelings
some folks blurted their feelings
out at the first chance they got...
and some kept their
emotions to themselves
they just let their
eyes do all the talking
back then, they knew how to love
they figured out how to voice and
express the matters of the heart
that's why some love stories,
are forever. Like these...
you're right
there was no
internet in those days...
no sms... short messaging service.
Here you go!
In short how would you say
those thousands of things...
that were dying to be articulated?!
Is this part of the
whole thing? - No ma'am...
a smiley doesn't have the
same effect a real smile has...
when shared between two eager faces
across the length of a classroom
rarlier one hid from teachers,
parents...
and even other students
whilst in the throes of romance
today we end up pursuing love
whilst hiding from each other
instead of hiding
behind librart shelves
...and trees like our seniors did...
today we can face each other yet
choose to hide behind computer screens
love happens real fast like the
speed of an internet connection...
and logs out equally easily
i mean think about it...
how can you actually
fall in love with...
...a display picture
or clever bio line?
You fall in love with a living
breathing fighting, angrt, complex...
complicated, sweet,
idiotic pretty amazing girl
yes friends, there is a
26th love stort as well...
but it won't work out with a
simple fraaandship request
for it to work one
would have to look...
...into her eyes and
walk towards her...
go down on one knee
vishal's gone crazy!
And speak the truth...
you're in my heart
and even my liver!
You're the fever that
strikes now or any time...
you're the one who'll
be in my life forever
preity...
i love you
i'm sorrt
its okay, i did the same
no not that
i've been so stressed out all
morning, i think i forgot to wear deo
reoww. - What!
At least i'm being honest!
From today... only the truth!
I watch girls... from
the hostel balcony.
I watch porn
also... and that's not all...
those pansy songs that rahul sings?
I write them
what? Really? Why
didn't you tell me earlier
oh my god!!!
Oh my god oh my god...
ma'am i'm 21... its legal!
Hey vishal that's the way man!
That's called the power of love!
Somebody call the principal!
I'm telling you i think
its all part of the show...
and the heart beats a little faster
neha! Neha! Neha cut the
lights... put on the av...
i swear on you it's true
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
oh dear god it's true
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
i swear on you it's true
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
the world has no clue
what it means to
fall in love like this
heart breaking happiness
that makes you realize
now you cannot
live without the other
now you cannot
live without the other
now evert road leads to you
oh dear god
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
i wish for one thing alone
that you stay right here beside me
as your light breaks the darkness
is that too much to ask?
Is that too much to ask?
Now evert dream is
coloured by your love
i swear on you it's true
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
i swear on you it's true
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
now evert dream is
coloured by your love
now evert road leads to you
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
with evert breath i take your name
and the heart beats a little faster
