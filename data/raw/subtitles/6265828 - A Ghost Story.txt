When I was little and we
used to move all the time,
I'd write these notes,
and I would fold them up really small...
...and I would hide
them in different places,
so that if I ever wanted to go back,
there'd be a piece of me there waiting.
- Did you ever go back?
- No.
See? That's what I'm saying.
'Cause I didn't need to.
What'd they say?
They were just like, old rhymes and poems.
Things I wanted to remember about...

[Man] I don't know if you
believe in the spirit world.
- [Woman] I do.
- [Man] You do?
[Woman] Yeah, I totally do.
[Man] Well, then this next
phenomenon will really fascinate you.
I know it sounds strange,
but it does begin with,
"Pick a card, any card", so pick one out.
And you got it?
- Burn the image into your mind.
- Yeah. Got it, got it.
[Man] I want you to
watch this very closely.
Because if the spirits are
with us in this haunted house...
...they may divine the card.
[Woman] Holy shit.
[indistinct conversations]
I don't-I don't- I don't
have a problem with it
if it's two people in love.
It's some sort of expression
of, you know, kind of...
[Woman] It sounds like you
don't think women should do that.
If it's not gonna be that
and it's not gonna make
us any money, then why...
And those are your two polarities?
[Woman] Polarities?
Priorities or whatever. Money's just money.
You gotta take that out
of the equation. Now what?
[Woman] Well, that's what I
was saying. It's not just...
[Man] No, no, you can find a reason.
And I wanna find out what happens, too!
So, no money.
What have you got left?
You've got... other people.
You got Clara, you've got time.
Time's a big one.
But you've got about as much
as anyone else, give or take.
What about God? Maybe you've got God.
Do you?
- [Woman] What? Have God?
- Yes.
No.
Okay.
Well, here's how I break it down.
A writer writes a novel.
A songwriter writes a song.
A symphonist writes a symphony,
which is maybe the best example
because all the best
ones were written for God.
So, tell me what happens if Beethoven's
writing his "Ninth Symphony"
and suddenly he wakes up one day
and realizes that God doesn't exist.
So, suddenly all of these
notes and chords and harmonies
that were intended to, you
know, supersede the flesh,
you realize, "Oh, that's just physics."
So Beethoven says,
"Shoot, God doesn't exist,
so I guess I'm writing
this for other people.
It's just nuts and bolts now."
He didn't have any
children, that I can recall,
- but if he did...
- He had a nephew.
- He had a what?
- A nephew, he had a nephew.
Okay. Great. So he-he writes it for him.
Or Immortal Beloved.
Yes.
Or for whoever that was.
But let's leave love out of this
and let's wrap this
all up under the blanket
of someone thinking,
"This is something that
they'll remember me for."
And they did. And we do.
And sure enough, we do
what we can to endure.
We build our legacy piece by piece,
and maybe the whole
world will remember you,
or maybe just a couple of people,
but you do what you can to
make sure you're still around
after you're gone.
And so we're still reading this book,
we're still singing the song,
and kids remember their
parents and their grandparents
and everyone's got their family tree,
and Beethoven's got his symphony,
and we've got it too.
And everyone will keep listening to it f...
...for the foreseeable future.
But...
...that's where things start breaking down,
because your kids...
Do you have kids?
Wait, who here has kids?
You? Your kids are gonna die.
Yours too. Yours too.
Hey, just sayin'. They're all gonna die,
and their kids will die,
and so on, and so on.
And then there's gonna be one
big-one big tectonic shift.
Yosemite will blow and the
Western plates will shift,
and the oceans will rise,
the mountains will fall,
and 90 percent of humanity will be gone.
One fell swoop. This is just science.
Whoever's left will...
...go to higher ground
and social order will fall away,
and we will revert to
scavengers and hunters
and gatherers, but maybe there's someone...
...someone who one day hums
a melody they used to know.
[humming Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony" ♪]
And it gives everyone a little bit of hope.
Mankind's on the verge of being wiped out,
but it keeps going a little bit longer
because someone hears someone
else hum a melody in a cave
and the physics of it in their ear
make them feel something other
than fear or hunger or hate,
and mankind carries on
and civilization gets back on track.
And now you're thinking
you're gonna finish that book.
But it won't last.
'Cause by and by, the planet's gonna die.
In a few billion years the
sun will become a red giant
and it'll, uh, eventually
swallow Earth whole.
This is a fact.
Now, maybe by that point,
we'll have set up shop on some
completely different planet.
Good for us. Maybe we've figured out a way
of carrying with us all
these things that matter.
They've got a photocopy
of the Mona Lisa out there,
someone sees it, mixes a little
bit of alien dirt with some spit,
paints something new, the
whole thing keeps going.
But even that doesn't matter.
Because even if some form of mankind
carries some recording of
Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony"
all the way into the future,
the future's gonna hit a brick wall.
The universe will keep expanding,
and it'll eventually
take all matter with it.
Everything you've ever strived for,
everything that you and some stranger
on the other side of the planet
share with some future stranger
on some entirely different
planet without even knowing it,
everything that ever made
you feel big or stand up tall,
it'll all go.
Every atom in this dimension...
...will be pulled apart
by force as simple as...
[can clatters]
And then all these shredded particles
will contract again...
...and the universe is gonna
suck itself back into a speck
too small for any of us to see.
So, you can write a book...
...but the pages will burn.
You can sing a song and pass it down.
You can write a play and hope
that folks will remember it...
...keep performing it.
You can build your dream house...
...but ultimately none
of that matters any more
than digging your fingers into the ground
to bury a fence post.
Or... or fucking.
Which I guess is just about the same thing.
