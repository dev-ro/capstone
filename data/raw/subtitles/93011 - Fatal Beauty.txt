Woo!
Check it out!
Oh, sugar.
You lookin' to party?
I want to talk
with you, daddy.
We can
do that, honey.
¶ Don't wanna blow
your cover, my dear ¶
¶ how'd you ever
end up down here? ¶
ooow!
¶ With a Smith and Wesson
and the fifth degree ¶
¶ and a mastermind
on disaster street ¶
here you go, honey.
¶ Ooh, baby,
what's your game? ¶
watch the jewels, baby.
Hey, come back!
Put it away!
Ooh, girl!
Where'd you get that dress?
What are you doing
in that leopard jumping outfit?
Ha ha ha!
¶ ...you're so
pretty, pretty, yeah ¶
aren't you
a little busy?
You in
a hurry, honey?
¶ Sin city know you... ¶
yeah!
Your daddy, too!
Wooooo!
¶ Sin city ¶
¶ sin city know you ¶
¶ sin city looking down... ¶¶
you wanna
have my baby?
Personal hygiene
is a good habit.
Oh, girl!
Get it, girl!
Look at her throwing them
around her neck.
That's too much!
Stop that!
Oh, you whore!
Ooh, too much
for me, honey!
ВїQue quieres?
What you want?
A carta blanca.
Don't speak Spanish.
What the fuck
you saying?
Want a glass?
What?
A glass!
No, wrap it in a taco,
dumb motherfucker!
Don't be doing
this shit to me, honey.
You people come up here
under the bushes.
Then you want
people like me
to get down on you.
You've got no teeth.
Brush!
Give me a kiss.
What?
Come on.
You better
kiss this, honey!
What's
wrong with you?
That nasty-assed
tongue of yours.
Howdy.
Oh, no, honey.
What do you want?
I'm your date,
little lady.
Don't squeeze me,
porky.
You're not my date.
I'm expecting
somebody here.
That John's
gonna blow the bust!
Relax, kid.
She'll get rid of him.
He'll cut your ass
into teeny pieces,
which will get blood
on my new dress.
Either you get
the fuck out of here,
or I'll cut
your dick off.
I have to go.
Dumb motherfuckers.
Every time I turn around,
somebody's trying
to get in my pants.
Girlfriend!
Ooh, honey!
Ooh, look at you!
Child, what is that
on your finger?
This is bad!
Is this new?
This is
beautiful, honey.
Who's your friend?
Honey, that's some fool
tried to pick me up.
Sure. I'm supposed
to believe that?
You want to
play that shit,
I'm going home.
Wait a minute,
for God's sake!
You got the money?
Yes, I do.
Do you
have the blow?
I'm getting it
in a couple hours.
What are you trying
to pull here, honey?
I can't wait
for this shit!
The sun doesn't
rise and set
at your command!
I'm very
well-connected.
You fucking bitch!
Aaaah!
Say!
There are decent people
trying to talk here.
Keep that shit down!
Back off, bitch!
Mind
your fucking business,
or you'll get hurt!
Ow!
Please!
You just gonna let him
drag her out
like that?
I'm minding
my own business, lady.
Get out this door,
fucking bitch!
I think that's enough.
Wanna bet, nigger?
I'll kick your black ass
back to Africa!
Stinking nigger!
You piece of crap!
You're dead meat!
You're dead!
You're dead!
Uh!
No!
Nigger!
Stop!
Fuck off!
Please!
Get your fingers
out of my eye!
Police officer down.
Get your asses
back here.
Aah!
No!
Police officer.
Freeze!
Fuck you!
Nice move,
asshole.
And don't
call me bitch.
[Crying]
Terrific.
What?
Shit!
Hey, Charlie.
Who's that?
Oh, shit!
That's, uh, kroll's
main distributor,
name of, uh,
delgadillo,
but he's no sweat.
What do you mean
he's no sweat?
It's already
a goddamn convention in there.
Leo, you only got to
worry about Lou Russo.
Russo? He's a hardass
from d block.
He could be tough.
You want to
call this off?
You got shit
in your blood?
No!
Let go of him, Earl.
Let go!
You all right?
Ok?
Charlie,
you all right?
Yeah, right.
Ok, you guys.
It's a little tight.
All right,
all right.
Uh...
They got to be
finished by now.
Give me 30 seconds.
The door will be open.
Ok.
You all right?
Yeah.
What are we going to do
about that scumbag, Leo?
Earl...
Not till I
give the sign, Earl.
Not till I
give the sign.
All right.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, man,
it's me.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Dawson, Russo,
come here!
I just
want you to see
what's
been going on.
What? Somebody tried to
stick some up his ass?
He's stoned
out of his mind.
Not only that,
he screwed up the cut!
Taste this stuff!
A snort of that
would kill an elephant.
You stupid!
You fool!
You idiot!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
All this boy's stuff has to
be properly cut and repacked.
Look at this!
He even stamped
the damn package wrong!
This has to
be repacked.
Ha ha ha ha!
Charlie, come here.
Come here, Charlie.
Charlie!
Charlie!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Yahoo!
[Gunfire]
Ha ha ha!
What are you
doing to me?
Huh?
No money! No dope!
No delgadillo!
I have
a reasonable explanation.
I don't need
explanations.
I need results.
Do you know
what captain McKay
will do to me?
And all over
some two-bit hooker.
Not a two-bit hooker.
Charlene farr
is my friend,
and she gave me
the McGyver bust
last month.
I don't care.
Hookers don't count.
Tax-paying citizens,
the kind that vote, count!
What? What are you telling me?
Doesn't all that bullshit
you gave me
when I left the academy
mean anything?
"Read the side
of the door, rizzoli."
What door?
The black and whites.
"To protect and serve.
"Remember that.
"Remember...
[Coughs]
Rizzoli."
When I want a lecture,
I'll see captain McKay,
which is what I'll get
because of your screw-up!
[Telephone rings]
Lieutenant Kellerman here.
Where?
She'll be right there.
Sergeant getz is down
at the international
grocery company,
and he needs you.
Oh, no.
I've been on my feet
for 18 hours.
I'm not going anywhere!
I'll drop if I don't
get some sleep!
Get your butt down there,
or you'll be back in records.
Drop on your day off.
Records, rizzoli.
Bye-bye.
[Door slams]
[Speaking Chinese]
[Speaking Chinese]
Shh!
What is she saying?
I speak Japanese,
not Chinese.
How much difference
could there be?
Lower the barriers!
Here's
our dusky little dick now.
What kept you?
Stopped to pick up
a sailor?
Yeah, but your mother
beat me to him.
Is that a joke?
Yeah.
What
happened?
Two crazies.
Professional rip-off.
They killed everyone
and made off with the goods.
Unidentified white males,
25 and 30.
Yeah, what do you
got there, Fred?
2, 3, got it.
Everywhere I go,
people are dying to meet me.
Looks like they
enjoyed their work.
No shit.
Yo, rizzoli, you know
where we could find a maid?
People like you
are the reason
abortion is legal.
All right.
Let's get him out of here.
Watch your back.
Looks like there's
a new bag on the street.
Why did you want me?
Over there.
Delgadillo?
You tell me.
50 bucks says
you can't identify him.
Why?
You want the bet
or not?
5o bucks, rizzoli.
Only this time,
no food stamps.
You're on.
Jesus, what happened
to him?
Looks like they, uh...
Emptied an entire clip
into his face.
You owe me 50,
rizzoli.
No, I don't think so.
It's delgadillo...
Definitely.
How do you
know that?
Check the pinky ring.
It's got
his initials on it.
Excuse me.
I've got it.
Let's go.
I'll drive.
Watch your step.
Kroll.
[Dripping]
Hey, stay bent over
like that,
and I'll show you
a good time.
One quick hump
and you'd be
in the hospital.
Ever get it
doggie style?
No. Tell me,
what's it like?
Ha ha ha!
Get these people
out of this area.
You got no business
being in this area!
Hey, what are you doing?
Jesus!
I--I'm telling
you something!
You are
in big--
how did you
figure that?
Trucks don't bleed.
You're
still here, hmm?
Keeps coming up kroll.
What are you
talking about now?
Conrad kroll.
Heavyweight valley guy.
I'm telling you,
this man is
moving serious weight.
On what evidence?
First, the van
with the body in it
said "kroll construction"
all over it.
The stiff in the van,
Charlie Dawson,
worked
for kroll enterprises,
security department.
Let's not forget
Lou Russo.
You know
what you got?
Nothing.
Wait a minute.
Look at this.
I pulled the file
on the transcript
from the cascales bust.
It says, "where did you
get the dope?"
Answer--"from a fat queen
named tito delgadillo
who runs a beauty shop
in encino."
The beauty shop's
in kroll Plaza.
Forget it.
Why are you
fighting me?
I feel it
in my gut!
I can't take your gut
to the city attorney's office.
You can't go anywhere
without evidence!
That's hard evidence!
Probable cause!
That's straight
from captain McKay.
How can I get
hard evidence
if you won't let me
go talk to him?
It seems
obvious to me.
A year ago,
he couldn't raise bus fare.
Now he's
building malls!
He's riding around
in a rolls royce
and sponsoring
the civic light opera,
for Christ's sake!
He's also sponsoring
a couple of
heavyweight politicians
down at city hall.
That scare you,
lieutenant?
No.
 You scare me,
rizzoli.
Writing on
the goddamn walls,
huh?
The names
of dead junkies.
Jesus.
What the hell
do you do?
What do you do?
Draw a line through
a dead junkie's name
every time you
take a dealer out?
Something like that.
Yeah.
Why?
It's a long, long story,
but I'll tell you this.
If you let me
go talk to kroll,
I'll wash the walls
and windows clean myself.
You know I hate
to do windows.
Go home
and get some sleep.
Get lucky, get laid,
get out of my face.
If I were you,
I'd stay away from Conrad kroll.
Jesus!
"Get laid." Please.
Hey, you
got any coke?
Come on.
Get out of here.
Watch it!
Jesus, guys.
This is
a private table.
Not anymore
it's not.
Tito delgadillo
sends his regards,
but, uh...
[Snap]
[Snap]
Get lost.
Earl.
Hee hee!
Listen, uh...
I'm not sure I know
this tito delgadillo.
Well, you've
missed your shot.
He's no longer
with us.
We all go sometime.
But the upside is,
we don't all
have to go without.
¶ ...can't you see how much
I need your lovin'? ¶
¶ say it to you
time and time again ¶
¶ oh, Casanova ¶
¶ Casanova... ¶¶
hey, Max.
Just a minute.
It looks nice
in here.
Hey,
it ought to.
What'll it be?
I think I will have
a pastrami on rye.
Make it ham.
So, how's it going?
Catching lots
of criminals?
Oh, I catch a couple,
I lose 'em.
Catch 'em, I lose 'em.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't see you.
I saw you.
You don't know me?
No.
No? Well,
I know you.
You're
the cunt that put
Bobby kerrigan away.
You know
something else...
Rizzoli?
I know where
you live, too.
I'm going to
break inside
your apartment,
I'm going to
kick your ass,
and maybe for dessert,
I'll fuck your brains out.
Be still, my heart.
You think
it's all talk!
I hope not.
You're everything
I want in a man--
a snot-nosed
little whipdick
in designer jeans.
Oh, that's
really funny.
A lot of big laughers
around here, huh?
Try and laugh this off.
Laugh this--
what's the matter?
Did you lose something?
You picked
my goddamn pocket!
That's a felony,
I think.
Really?
Assume the position.
You gotta have a warrant.
You can't search me.
You got a nice
little keister, boy.
Oh, my goodness,
what is this?
This is
not a good sign.
Very bad for you.
You get out
of my way, bitch,
or I'll carve you
into steak tartare!
You know,
there are two things
I don't like in the world.
One is to be called "bitch."
The other
is steak tartare.
Now, I have had
a shitty day,
so do us both a favor.
Put down the knife,
take your ass out of here,
and we'll
call it a night, ok?
Ok, bust me.
I don't care.
Make my day.
Go ahead!
That's what you're
best at, isn't it?
Come on!
I don't
want to bust you.
I want to go home
and eat my sandwich.
You mean, you're
not going to bust me?
Go.
Quick!
Kids today, huh, Max?
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
Hello, Sam.
What?
You're hungry now?
Go into the refrigerator.
Be nice if you learned how
to tear the tops off these bags.
Then I wouldn't have to
rush home to your butt.
High toy cat food.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Hello.
Rita?
It's me, charlene.
I'm at good Sam.
What did
the doctors say?
I'm all right.
Look, Rita...
I'm going to need a fix bad,
I'm not going to be, you know,
working looking like this.
Can you stand me the bread?
I don't give people
money for drugs,
even if
they save my life.
I've got something.
What?
You interested in
the Chinese market rip?
Yeah.
Word is
there's a goon squad
looking for the guys
that did it.
Somebody's really pissed.
Any idea who?
Well, I don't know,
uh...
But the whisper is
he drives a...
A rolls.
Kroll.
Rita, is it worth
something to you?
Yeah, maybe.
I'll come by
this afternoon,
and we'll talk then.
Hey!
Hey!
[Car radio]
 ¶ runnin' for your life ¶
 ¶ you've got to
 turn around, baby ¶

 ¶ now every single time ¶

can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking
for Conrad kroll.
Hi, there.
Good morning.
What's your business,
miss, uh...
Detective rizzoli.
And what might
your name be?
Mike marshak.
I'm head of security
for kroll enterprises.
Oh.
Mr. kroll isn't in.
That's his car,
isn't it?
Maybe he
took another one
when he left.
You got it.
Try kroll Plaza
on ventura.
I just
came from there.
I can't help you.
I could go in
and wait.
Rizzoli.
That's Italian, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
I always had a weakness
for Italian ladies.
In school,
there was one,
this rose amalfitano.
My God, those eyes.
She had one problem.
She thought those
beautiful brown eyes
could get her
anything she wanted.
Maybe all
pretty Italian ladies
feel that way.
Figure?
What's your point?
The point is,
this is private property.
If you want to
come calling,
show me a warrant.
Otherwise,
 arrivederci.
For all this,
we had to go through
rose amalfitano?
Just trying
to be friendly.
Oh.
My name's
detective rizzoli.
I have
some questions.
Relax, Marty.
Sweet, but slow.
It's tough
to get good help
these days.
Detective rizzoli's
gone to all this trouble
to see us.
We should oblige her.
Would you hand me
a towel?
Seeing you
raises a question
in my mind.
Yeah? What's that?
Does that come
in adult size?
That's very funny,
rizzoli.
Thank you.
Let's discuss it
over lunch.
I'd love it.
To what do I owe
the honor
of this visit?
Last night
in Chinatown,
several people
were killed.
One is a tenant
of yours,
tito delgadillo,
a drug dealer.
Two of the others
worked for you.
Yeah, Russo and, uh...
Charlie Dawson.
Yeah, Charlie Dawson.
That's terrible.
Of course,
I hardly knew them.
I guess
you didn't know
they did time
in vaccaville
for narcotics.
I didn't know that.
They were
packaging narcotics,
in large quantity,
as I hear it,
and they got
ripped off.
No!
If I was speaking
hypothetically,
which I am,
and I thought
my dope was stolen,
I wouldn't be
sitting by the pool
drinking wine.
If we were speaking
hypothetically.
I don't believe
that you're implying
that I was involved with
these...Narcotic dealings.
But you are,
aren't you?
I never said that.
You are.
No, I'm not.
That's the most
incredible thing
I've ever heard.
Of course, I read
that your stock
was down nine points
since the beginning
of the year.
That would panic
any normal guy.
Get me
the narcotics division.
Maybe you were
overextended.
This is Conrad kroll.
Does a rizzoli
work for you?
Detective,
if you don't mind.
She accused me
of dealing narcotics.
I never said that.
He wants to talk
to you.
Can I get you something?
Some humble pie?
He's offering me
humble pie.
He's a real clown.
I don't mean
he's a clown--
see, what--
you said if you were me,
you wouldn't come here.
I decided
you weren't me,
so here I am.
He uses
such rash language.
All right.
Yes, sir.
If they let you go,
I'll hire you.
The pay is better
than the police department.
Yeah, but you got
a shitty health plan.
Listen, drop by anytime.
Use the front door
next time.
That's very white
of you.
Bye, Marty.
Jesus, Marty.
Christ.
Go get me
Mike marshak.
The next time somebody
sneaks up on me--
you understand
what I'm saying?
Shit.
 Attention, all units--
918 at 1033 north cherokee.
 Officer needs assistance.
 Use caution.
 Suspect could be armed.
 Code 3.
[Megaphone]
 We are willing to talk.
 No one wants to hurt you.
 You are
 completely surrounded.
 Please throw
 your weapon out,
 and come out
 with your hands up.
We may need
tear gas.
Hey, Carl.
What are you
doing here?
I was going
to charlene farr's place
and heard the call.
That's her place.
I hope
she didn't use
the same drugs
as this guy.
What guy? Carl.
What--Carl!
 You are
 completely surrounded.
Hey, Rita!
Ha ha ha!
What is he doing
over there?
Fools rush in.
Shigeta.
Here he comes!
Jesus!
He's hopped up!
He's got a gun.
Careful!
He's wired up!
I'm a nice man.
I'm a respectable man.
Drop the gun!
Fuck you,
little man!
Fire!
Fire!
Stay there,
shigeta!
Hold your fire!
Just stay there!
Be cool!
No.
What the hell's
keeping him up?
He's down.
Get a paramedic here.
Jesus!
It had to be pcp.
He must've been
mainlining pcp.
 Let's clear the roadblocks.
 Cordon off
 the immediate area.
 Let the paramedic people
 through.
 Units 17 and 22,
 you're clear.
What's wrong
with charlene?
Was it the new bag?
Will she live?
I don't know.
What new bag?
Must've been
some radical shit.
Took out
both of them.
Where'd she get it?
Her pimp--
Jimmy something.
Hangs around
those fern bars
down on Melrose.
Looks like
Richard gere.
Huh...
Aw, shit!
Go run some cold water
in the tub.
Grab her legs.
Grab her legs!
Come on, boy!
Damn!
Come on, charlene!
Come on! Damn it!
Here, let me through.
Forget it.
Come on.
Beat it! Don't go
near kroll!
Whoo!
Trouble, rizzoli?
You got that $50
you owe me?
Next week.
Your wife probably
hears that every night.
You think
that's funny?
Yeah.
How did it go?
Fine, if you don't mind
getting your ass chewed.
Fortunately,
I have more ass
than he's got teeth.
I contacted a friend
at vaccaville
about landers, Dawson,
and Russo.
They were very big
with the Aryan brotherhood--
the white-supremacy boys.
Find out
who else got out
of vaccaville recently.
Just the heavyweights,
though--
the narcotics,
armed robbers, killers.
Sure. Anything else?
Yeah. Help me
find this guy
who hangs out
in fern bars
on Melrose.
Hear he looks like
Richard gere.
Carl, line two.
Who?
What do
you mean, "who?"
Richard gere.
I can't believe
you don't know
who Richard gere is.
He's an actor--
tall, gorgeous guy.
You better
stop going
to those
cantinflas movies.
You'd better start
a new wall, Rita.
You'll need it.
Why is that,
Jerry?
This.
Polterman from Metro
brought that in.
Here's the stuff
you gave me.
You see any difference?
The markings.
They're both cut
with fentanyl.
This one's normal,
8 to 1.
This one is 50%,
with a heavy cut of pcp.
It'll kill you
or drive you insane
in less than 30 seconds.
Shit. Did you
tell Kellerman?
You know him.
If it's street people,
he calls it
population adjustment.
Thanks, Jerry.
Meet me on Melrose
and Fuller
in an hour, ok?
Why?
Richard gere.
Not tonight.
I got a date.
Rita!
Rita!
Damn!
Ha ha ha!
How's it going,
rizzoli?
Just fine.
What are you
doing here?
Mr. kroll sent me.
Wants to make sure
nothing happens
to you.
You wormed your way
into his heart.
Well, tell Mr. kroll
nothing's going to
happen to me.
I know, but the man
who pays me
wants to make sure.
So how about
we make friends
and I follow you
for a while?
Sorry, babe,
I got a date.
Dressed like that?
Meaning what?
Meaning
you're, uh...
Meaning you're
probably undercover,
or, uh...You got
shitty taste.
I got to go.
I'm going with you.
You made an asshole
out of me this morning.
You won't do it again.
Really?
Have a good evening.
¶ Hey! ¶

Oh, yeah? Where?
A restaurant
two blocks down
across the street.
Let's get him.
I'll call you
if I need you.

I beg your pardon,
but you look like
my favorite actor.
Are you
Richard gere?
Here, have a seat.
Oh, really?
Have a seat.
You like Richard gere?
I just love
Richard gere!
I could
introduce you to him.
Don't play with me.
We know each other
from the old neighborhood.
You've got the finest legs
I have seen
in this restaurant
tonight.
You do something
with your hair.
Oh, stop that!
This hair makes
your eyes sing to me.
Those eyes, those legs--
you're an actress,
aren't you?
Yes! How did
you know?
The way you carry
yourself.
Your body.
Jane Fonda.
Yes. Could you tell?
I mean,
is it evident?
You're working
on that body.
Can I get you
a drink?
Yes, I'd like
a cranberry juice
with a Tequila shot.
Cranberry juice
and a Tequila shot
for the lady.
With a body like yours,
you have to be a star.
I can't believe
you just--
I am telling you.
I tell you what.
Finish this.
Take you to my place.
I have some blow
that will set you free.
What are you
talking about?
Blow. Flake. Buzz.
Colombian goo-goo dust.
We'll do a few lines.
I'll call
some people I know.
I am telling you,
you have a future
in this town.
I feel it
in my bones.
Stop!
Trust me. This is
your lucky night.
I'll open up a--
you'll open up
something
you don't
want to know.
What is that?
What?
That.
Cold and hard.
That.
Cold and hard?
Oh, that!
That.
That's rad.
Rad?
Mm-hmm. Conrad.
You're under arrest.
Fuck you, lady!
She's got a gun!
Oh!
Honey, get back!
Let's go!
Did you see it?
Lady...
Fuck! My ass!
Don't be
such a crybaby.
Give me your hand.
What's wrong with you?
Don't be
such a crybaby.
Hello, boys.
I'm a police officer.
Please take this gentleman
into the refrigerator
and hang him up
with the sausages,
if you don't mind.
Come on,
help me, you guys.
Ooh, cookies!
Cookies! God!
What's going on?
Nothing.
Keep everybody cool.
I'll talk
to you later.
Have a cookie.
They're delicious.
Oh, that's
wonderful!
It's so hard
to find good help
like you gentlemen.
I want a doctor!
Get me a doctor!
Why? It's only
a flesh wound.
I'm bleeding!
I've been shot!
I know, honey.
I shot you.
Get me a doctor!
I'm bleeding
to death!
You're not going to
bleed to death.
I'm not?
No!
You might freeze, but...
Police.
Narcotics.
We got one guy in there.
The other went out
the back. Hurry.
Aah! Are you crazy?
What's the matter,
honey?
Jesus Christ, lady!
Hang in there.
What? What?
Foot patrol is here.
You got five minutes.
Ok.
How's it going here?
Fine. How's it going
out here?
Ok.
Is the food
any good?
Yeah.
Great. We'll
come back next week.
Hurry up.
Ok.
Get me down
from here.
Hey, who was that?
Friends of mine
from the coroner's office.
I invited them
to take your body
in about 10 minutes.
You could
alleviate all that
by just simply giving.
Give what?
Fatal beauty.
Fatal beauty?
Ha ha ha!
This is funny, huh?
Beats me.
I beg your pardon?
You overplayed it,
bitch.
You're in some
serious shit now.
You know, there's
two things in the world
I really hate--
a man
with funky underarms,
and someone
who calls me a bitch.
What do you think
you got?
Try false arrest.
And you try this.
You try this.
You killed a friend
of mine, charlene farr.
You know her?
Yeah!
You gave her
bad dope.
Yes, I did. Yes!
Tell me
where you got it,
or I'll
blow your nuts off.
At a buy house
on ramparts
and 13th street
from a guy
named Raphael.
I swear!
Don't shoot, ok?
See? All you have to do
is be nice,
and good things
come to you.
Is that you?
Y-y-yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah,
that's it! Yeah!
God, that's pitiful!
It only feels
about that big.
I'd really be pissed
if I were you.
You gonna get me
down from here?
¶ Jimmy on my mind ¶
you gonna--
c-c-come on!
¶ Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy ¶
you are
fuckin' crazy!
¶ Jimmy on my mind ¶¶
Jesus!
[Door shuts]
Come on, man!
Get out of here!
Get the fuck
out of here, faggot!
I'll be back, man!
Come on, move it!
I'll pay you.
I'm gonna pay you!
Hey, man!
Come on, man!
Looking for something,
pretty one?
Yeah. My friend
Jimmy silver
told me
if I stood here,
I might
meet somebody
named Raphael.
Jimmy silvers?
Oh, yeah!
Runs a taco stand
over on bellflower.
Runs a line of girls
out of Melrose.
I take you in for 20--
fatal beauty,
the hottest bag around.
Epifanio
get you anything.
Oh, yeah?
Right this way.
You're kind of cute.
Next week,
I get you 40.
What do I
have to do?
I don't know,
but it may be fun.
She wants to
go in first.
I know that bitch.
That chinga is heat, man
all right.
Talk to you later.
Ah!
Look at them.
They want it--
the cure!
They want
fatal beauty!
Hey, man,
heat's here!
Where?
Inside--
she's black
and dressed
like a puta.
Come on, let's go.
[Coughing]
[Sniffling]
This baby's anxious.
She paid extra
to go first.
Grams cost 80.
5s and 10s only.
I'll take a half.
Move!
Hey, man!
30,000.
40.
Pot's, right?
Mm-hmm.
You Raphael?
Maybe.
Why?
I thought we could talk
about helping one another.
Yeah, sure.
You and every
other chick
that comes in here.
Just take the stuff
and blow.
I'm not talking sex.
I'm talking business.
I'd like to buy
in quantity.
Ha!
Can we discuss this
without everyone
in the hallway hearing?
Ha ha ha!
I like your chain.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ok.
It's going to be a minute.
Ok, goldilocks, what--
one word,
and I'm going to
clear your sinuses.
Move it, here!
Hey!
Let's go!
What the hell's
goin' on?
Ok, where's
the black bitch?
In with Raphael.
Yah!
Argh! Uh!
Uh! Uh!
You're never getting
out of here, bitch.
Not alive, anyhow.
[Cocks gun]
Neither are you,
unless you talk.
Ha ha ha!
Earl, Earl! Up to
the third floor,
down
the fire escape.
Hey,
where's he going?
Now, who are you
fronting for?
Some crazies just out
of vaccaville.
Names.
Hey, how should I--
but I could tell you
where they are.
Oh, yeah? Where?
Ha.
Right outside
that door,
getting ready
to come in here
and blow
your black ass away.
No!
Aah!
Aah!
What the hell
are you doing here?
Oh, I've missed you, too,
rizzoli.
How exactly
did you find me?
Transmitter
under your bumper.
I've been following you
since last night.
That's a nice outfit.
Oh, shit!
This is great,
marshak.
[Noise]
Where'd
everybody go?
Maybe they got a whiff
of your perfume.
That's funny.
Almost hysterical,
marshak.
[Rats squeak]
I've known you
one day, rizzoli.
Already, my life
is passing
before my eyes.
Trust me, marshak,
it's not a pretty sight.
What are you
doing here, marshak?
I'm here to collect
on my tire.
What does it take
to get on
a first-name basis with you?
You might try minding
your own business
and not following me.
Right now, following you
is my business.
If you
don't like it,
you could always
go home.
I would, but my boss
worries about you.
He's worried that
I'll find his drugs
before he does.
Once I find them,
I'll look for him,
and I'll find him.
If you fuck with me,
I'll find you, too.
Bullshit.
Yee-ahh!
Cover the hall.
Rizzoli,
you ok?
Why? Scared
I'm going to
find the drugs
before you?
I'm telling you
I don't know
anything about
any blow.
[Door creaks]
[Creak]
Marshak!
You ok?
Yeah.
[Siren]
Marshak!
Marshak!
Yeah.
[Sirens]
Are you all right?
Yeah. I just
fell on my ass,
that's all.
Heat, Earl!
All the fuck over.
[Helicopter]
Come on, rizzoli.
[Crack]
Shit.
Rizzoli?
Rizzoli.
Hi.
Oh!
I'm sorry to bother you.
This is father Martin
at Mary star of the sea.
Some of the children were
reading about detective rizzoli.
The entire fourth grade
has written her a letter.
But the article did not say
which hospital she--
oh, well,
thank you very much,
and God bless you, too.
The cunt's at vista Verde.
Sorry. I didn't know
you were busy.
I'll come back later.
No, no, no,
no, no, stay.
I was just leaving.
You marshak?
Jimenez, yeah?
[Door slams]
So how you doing,
rizzoli?
Good.
Good.
Those the two
you been after?
[Sighs]
You know, marshak,
I'm not so good
at saying stuff,
but I have to
thank you.
It's my job,
rizzoli.
Yeah. So what
do you want?
What do you mean?
Why are you here?
I'm looking
for peace, rizzoli.
Piece?
Piece of what,
marshak?
Real nice, rizzoli.
Why don't you just
open the package, huh?
Ain't nothin'
going to jump
out of here, is there?
Wow!
Told you I
followed you
that night.
God. This is
really great.
Yeah.
I can't accept this.
What do you mean,
can't accept it?
I said
I can't accept it.
Why not?
Because this is like
taking a bribe
from kroll.
Hey, lady,
honest money
bought this dress.
What I do for kroll
is strictly legal.
You work for kroll.
Kroll sells dope.
The money you make
is dope money.
You bought this dress
with dope money.
Do you understand?
Maybe I do,
maybe I don't.
Look, the man
pays my salary.
Maybe I
let it slide.
I'll be there
in half an hour.
 Dr. hart to room 1624.
 Dr. hart to room 1624.
Yeah,
here it is.
 Respiratory tech
 to o.B., please.
Freeze!
Aah!
Somebody
get help!
Aah!
Everybody ok here?
What happened?
It's just my ankle.
When you say freeze,
do people stop for you?
Yeah.
Doesn't work
for me.
Doctor?
[Screech]
How's he doing?
He's got
a sprained ankle.
Oh, good.
What now?
I'm going home.
He stays the night.
I'll give you
a ride.
No, thanks.
Got a quarter?
What do you mean,
"no, thanks"?
You haven't
got a car.
What's going on,
rizzoli?
Yellow cab,
please.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Give me the number
to yellow cab.
You're what's wrong.
People are sticking
shit up their nose,
and they're dying because
people let it slide.
I got lunatics coming into
a goddamn hospital
to shooe me
over some bad drugs
because somebody
let it slide.
You're what's wrong,
marshak.
Get the fuck
away from me, ok?
 Dr. Madison,
 please call line one.
Hey, rizzoli.
Come on,
rizzoli.
The world's
gone to shit,
but it isn't
all my fault!
Stay out of my face.
What do you
want me to
do about it?
Nothing.
Not a damn thing,
marshak.
And you know why?
Because you're a coward.
It's much safer
to let it slide, right?
God help you
if you ever
have to take
a stand.
I do what I have to.
You're getting fat,
kroll gets fatter,
and people
keep on dying.
You listen!
You're an asshole,
and you're a coward.
Now fuck off.
Hey, rizzoli.
Rizzoli!
Let me give you
a ride home.
It's a two-hour
walk from here,
for chrissake.
Come on.
Let me give you
a ride home.
I won't say
a God damn word.
You won't
say anything?
Nothing?
Not a God damn word.
I'll just drive.
Oh, yeah.
I really believe that.
¶ Mmmm ¶
¶ mm hmmm ¶
¶ mm mmm ¶¶
must you do that?
Hmm?
Sorry.
You look nice
tonight, rizzoli.
Do something different
with your hair?
Um-umm. Same--
damn.
Tricky.
Very tricky.
Sorry, rizzoli--
for being
such an asshole.
That's all right, marshak.
I'll get used to it.
Bye.
Yeah.
Hey.
What?
What about
the dress?
No.
I told you I...
[Cat meows]
[Meow]
[Meow]
What's the matter,
rizzoli?
My cat's
on the roof.
So, what, are you
going to shoot him?
No. But my door is open.
Cat's on the roof.
And my cat
hates heights.
He's one of my
many admirers.
Hey.
What are you
doing here?
They're dead.
They're all dead.
 ¶ Red hot ¶
 ¶ baby, you're red hot,
 red hot ¶
 ¶ I need your love ¶¶
Jesus.
Jesus?
I mean, you let it slide,
right, marshak?
You want to tell me
what happened?
Well, um...
We were just having
fun, that's all.
I mean...
We were just
kicking back,
and the party
was breaking up.
And, um...
I had this coke.
So we decided
to do it up.
And it was supposed
to have this radical
buzz, right?
Anyway, I, um...
I decided
I wanted to
take a jump
in the pool first.
And they started
without me.
I didn't know.
Otherwise I'd be
just like them.
Zack...
Where did you
get the stuff?
From cecile.
Cecile?
Who's cecile?
She's my mom.
Match point,
cecile.
In your face!
Great shot!
Good, cecile.
Ha ha ha!
Better luck
next time, huh?
Congratulations,
Marty.
How about
another set?
I have to go
up to the house.
Hi, Cece. Did
you get him?
Whipped his
skinny butt.
Excuse me,
Mrs. jaeger?
Deliveries
around back.
Mrs. jaeger, I'm
detective rizzoli.
I'm with narcotics.
I hardly mistook you
for a guest
in your undercover
suit by K-Mart.
That's really,
really witty.
This is about
your son.
What's he
done now?
He's over at detox.
I hope they have
better luck.
Excuse me,
Mrs. jaeger?
Take your hand off.
Excuse me.
My mistake.
Last night 10 of your
son's friends od'd.
Your son says he got
the stuff from you.
My son is
a congenital liar.
Tennis, Cece?
Sure.
10 minutes.
That's real motherly.
Your kid's in detox,
10 kids are dead,
and you're meeting her
in 10 minutes.
I'm sorry
about my son.
I'm sorry
about his friends.
Sure.
I've done
everything I can.
Excuse me.
I hate to keep
bothering you
Mrs. jaeger, but...
There is more.
Listen to me,
miss ravioli,
or whatever
your name is.
You put your hand
on me one more time,
you'll wish to hell
you hadn't.
You know,
you're right.
Why don't you
just tell me
where you got
the stuff from?
Mrs. jaeger?
Now you get
out of my house!
Do you hear me?
Get out!
Ohh!
Now, Mrs. jaeger,
everybody knows
it's against the law
to hit a police officer.
I'm afraid you're
under arrest,
and I've got to read you
your rights. Understand?
You have the right
to remain silent.
You bitch!
Ow!
Oh, my God!
You have the right
to speak with an attorney
and to have an attorney
present during questioning.
Mrs. jaeger, I don't want
to arrest you.
Just tell me where
you get your stuff,
and I'll leave
you alone.
That's all
I need to know.
Come on.
I'm sorry
about the window.
I don't like disrupting
people's lives.
Just tell me where
you buy your stuff.
You won't get away
with this! Are you--
what is your problem?!
I come over here
to tell you about your kid,
and what do you do?
God damn!
Get your hands off me!
You throw crap
at me.
Excuse me,
excuse me.
Shit, Rita,
what are you doing?
Thank you.
Hit her! Hit her!
Take her. Go.
Ow!
I can't let you go
anywhere without me.
Somebody get her!
Don't let her go!
Well, get her!
Don't let--
damn, marshak.
I cannot believe that I
hit this woman that way.
I can't believe
that you would
encourage me to do that.
I think
she needed hitting.
You want some coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
Make yourself
at home.
Thank you.
Hey, how do you take
your coffee?
Black.
Oh.
[Telephone rings]
Hello?
When?
Yeah, uh...
Yeah, you call.
No, you do it.
All right.
Just let me have
some coffee,
and I'll be fine.
Maybe you'd rather have
some juice, huh?
You want juice?
Coffee's fine.
All right. We'll
make coffee.
Or something to drink,
maybe whiskey?
Rizzoli,
what's the matter?
Nothing!
I'll just make you
a drink.
Mom always told me
to be a good host.
You want a drink?
Just tell me what you want.
I know how to
take care of people.
I'm real good at this.
Take your glass--
I don't want a drink,
rizzoli.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll get you
some coffee.
It's no big deal.
I just want you to know
you're welcome in my house,
and how pleased I am
that you're kind enough
to come all this way
with me,
because you think
I'm a nice person
and pretty responsible.
So what do I do?
You want me to go?
No, I-I don't
want you to go.
I just want to know
what's happening.
What's going on?
Talk to me.
I got four dead kids
at the grammar school.
8, 9, 10, and 12.
Dead by fatal beauty.
I guess they wanted me
to call his mother
and tell her,
but I can't, you know.
I don't know what to say.
Because I'm kind of
responsible
for trying to get this stuff
off the streets.
You know, every time
I take one out...
Every time I think
I'm this close,
I got more people...
Gone, you know.
I got little kids dying,
I got fucking teenagers,
and adults and old people
and everybody.
But I just don't know
what to do, man.
I'm really tired.
So what are you
going to do?
Be a quitter?
You blame yourself?
You're going to accept
the responsibility
for all that shit
out there or what?
Now, please.
Don't talk to me
about responsibility.
Because I'm responsible,
you know.
You want to talk
about stuff like this?
I'll tell you, man.
I was not
a pretty kid.
I knew that.
My mother never
let me forget,
because I come
from pretty people.
People who don't say boo.
But I fucked up.
I had a baby.
Didn't have no husband.
Didn't even have an "o"
after the number.
Just one-four.
You know, I was 14,
I started going out
with this guy
who I found out
went out with me
on a dare.
[Sighs]
I don't think
I ever got over that.
I couldn't see no way
to get people to like me.
And then I discovered
drugs.
Now, drugs,
I could hang out.
I could party,
I could dance,
I could go to bed
with people,
I could be funny,
I could be pretty,
you know?
And I thought,
nirvana.
I found nirvana,
you know.
And I did them
for a long time.
And this pretty little baby
kind of kept growing
and got cute.
Oh, man, she was so sweet.
All she did was hug.
She'd hug you and say,
"I love you."
That's all she did.
But when you're high,
it doesn't matter,
you know?
And I came in one day
after making a run,
and I get in and my stash
was gone through.
And I'm looking around,
and it didn't occur to me
that there was something
else wrong in the house.
Ok, I'm looking
for the stuff,
and it's
all over the floor.
My shit is gone.
Then the phone rings.
It's a guy
down at the pool,
calling me to tell me
that my...Daughter...
Was dead...
Because she got
into my shit.
When I think back now,
I think of all these
little kids, you know,
who don't want anything
but to...To be looked at
as somebody special,
somebody worthwhile.
You want to tell them
this ain't the way,
but you can't, because
they don't listen.
They don't fucking
listen, man.
So they just keep dying.
Oh, rizzoli.
It's ok.
It's ok, baby.
It's okay.
[Telephone rings]
[Telephone rings]
Hey, marshak.
Yoo-hoo! Can you get
the phone for me, please?
 Hi, it's Rita. If you
 have a message,
 leave it
 after the tone.
Hey, marshak!
 Rizzoli, I've talked
 to captain McKay.
 He didn't mind you
blowing away that scumbag...
Mike?
 Or hanging the pimp up
 in some meat locker...
Mike?
 But when you invade
 a woman's home
 and punch her out
 in front of her guests,
 you've gone too damn far.
 He wants to see you now.
 I don't mind
 telling you, rizzoli--
[telephone rings]
Hello?
Detective rizzoli,
sorry to bother you.
This is cecile jaeger,
Zack's mother.
How'd you get
this number?
At the detoxification center.
It's about Zack.
What happened?
He...Well...
They're ready.
I'll be right here.
I'd better go.
What happened?
He cut his wrists
last night.
Could you come
down here? Please?
Yeah, I'll be
right there.
Good evening, ma'am.
Excuse me, please.
Thank you for coming.
How's he doing?
They don't know yet.
One break--at least
we have the same blood type.
I was...
The reason I called
is...Is I want to help.
Hmm. You really
want to help?
Tell me who
you buy from.
Have a seat.
His name
is Denny miflin.
A young man,
attractive, blond.
Know where I can
find him tonight?
He'll be at kroll Plaza
tonight about 7:00.
He always wears
a white turtleneck.
Anything else?
Yes. He'll be
making a pickup
from his suppliers
tonight.
They'll do it
in some store.
I don't know
how they work.
Thank you very much.
Keep me posted, huh?
I will.
You've been terrific.
Yeah.
Terrific.
Balloons!
Mommies and daddies,
come and get some balloons
for the kiddies.
Complimentary balloons.
Balloons! We got red ones,
white ones, blue ones!
A gram.
100 bucks.
Yeah.
Flowerpot.
You better go get that blow
from those kids, Carl.
It's rizzoli.
Will you be
all right?
Yeah, but hurry.
And, for God's sakes,
take off that tie.
Mr. kroll had better know.
See what her friend
is up to.
Out of the way!
Freeze!
Huh?
Give me the dope.
Give me the drugs!
Do you like my tie?
Mm-hmm.
Uh-uh.
Don't make me
repeat myself.
Do you like my tie?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Get out of here!
Ah!
Uh-huh.
Something's going on.
Maybe I know
what it is.
Those two guys
from the mug shots
just came out
of LA baguette.
Nova and Skinner.
It's got to be.
Take them out.
Try to avoid trouble
if you can.
Go, Marty.
Her, too.
You got a problem, Mike?
No.
I got no problem.
Excuse me.
Now.
[Balloon pops]
Hey, what an asshole!
Let's see the stuff.
Denny, let's see
that stuff.
Check it out.
Here's 10 grand.
Count it.
All right, Leo?
Here's 20.
Uh--
don't make a sound,
or we're both dead.
Listen to me,
God damn it.
The shit's about to
hit the fan.
It's a wipeout.
All of them and you, too.
Do you believe me now?
I was a fool not to.
Shit, rizzoli, we're all
entitled to make mistakes.
Yeah.
Uhh!
Come on!
Uhh!
Aaah!
[Gunshots]
Denny?
Denny?
Denny?
Stop.
Come on, move!
Move!
Fuck!
Ready?
Go on, quick,
do it!
Hey!
Come on, come on.
Earl, come on,
let's go!
Let's go!
Follow me in.
Yaa! Yaa! Yaa!
It won't move.
Forget it.
Wait. Here, here.
Shh! Come on.
Aah!
There she is!
Harry, she's in the next aisle!
Shit!
O.K., I'll fire,
you go past. Go!
I'm going to go here.
[Gunfire]
[Click click]
Bitch!
[Crash!]
Shhh...
Hey, bitch!
You're fucking meat!
Hey, bitch!
I'm coming!
I got you!
Got you!
Hey, bitch!
I got you!
You're meat!
Hey, bitch!
I'm coming!
I got you!
[Creak]
[Creak]
Ha ha ha!
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
You know, marshak,
it's getting
to the point
where I'm glad
to see you.
You're too fickle
for me, rizzoli.
Will you be
all right
by yourself
for a while?
Get that
son 0f a bitch.
You're on.
[Crying]
Well, well, well.
Nice to see you
again, Mr. kroll.
Are you being
sincere, rizzoli?
Surprise.
Think so?
[Sniffs]
Kevlar, bitch!
Ha ha!
Aah!
Smith and Wesson,
asshole.
Hey, what happened?
It looks like all hell
broke loose here.
Hey...
How you doing?
Good.
Guess I'll be going
away for a while.
Yeah, but
the good news is,
I'll be waiting for you
when you get out.
Hang in there, babe.
Everything's
going to be fine.
You're going
to be fine.
