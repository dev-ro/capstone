[ominous music playing]
- [gun cocks]
- [breathing heavily]
[soldier] I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Where is he hiding?
[speaking Arabic]
[soldier] Your husband is a wanted man.
We have orders to bring him in.
[speaking Arabic]
I want to ask you again.
Where is he now?
[breathing heavily]
Colonel, let me talk to her alone.
Look at her.
She's terrified.
Believe me, she'll talk,
but not like this.
You got five minutes.
- [door opens]
- [indistinct chatter]
[door closes]
[in Arabic] Listen, madam.
We're not here to kill your husband,
but to arrest him.
I'm afraid for my son.
I promise we won't hurt him.
When your husband is in custody,
we'll release him to you.
Your son isn't to blame
for his dad's actions.
Think of your son. Just your son.
He's all that matters now.
[helicopter flying overhead]
[in English] He should be in one of
these buildings. Second floor, she said.
[sighs]
All right, move out.
[dramatic music playing]
[brakes hiss]
[soldier] Let's stay alert.
[soldier] B Team heading up
east stairwell.
[soldier] Alpha Team in position.
[soldier] Copy that, Alpha Team.
[gunshots]
[soldier] Found the target!
Get down now! On the ground!
[man in Arabic] Do it!
[soldier in English] I said get down!
On the ground! Hands up now!
[man in Arabic] Do it.
[soldier in English] Don't look at me!
Turn around!
Get the kid against the wall.
The kid! Get him somewhere safe!
Get that kid out of there!
[boy in Arabic] Dad, what should I do?
I'm really scared.
[in English] Something's wrong.
[engine idling]
[soldier] Answer me when I talk to you.
Are there weapons here?
[woman speaking indistinctly]
Hey! Any weapons here?
Ask if there are weapons.
[in Arabic] Do you have weapons?
[speaking Arabic]
- [gunfire]
- [in English] Get down! Take cover!
Get down now! Retreat!
We need backup!
Get down now! Where are they?
Two o'clock! You see them?
In front!
Target right! Target right!
- [gunfire continues]
- Go! Go!
Go, go!
[gunfire stops]
[soldier on radio] Target eliminated.
All clear.
[engine idling]
[breathing nervously]
[man in Arabic] Do it, son.
You'll make me proud.
God will reward you.
Do it!
- [soldier in English] Shut up! Move it!
- [man in Arabic] Do it, son!
Do it, son!

[Tania exclaiming and laughing]
[in English] Oh, my God!
Mom's going to lose it!
- [Klara] Sweetie!
- Good flight, huh?
Oh, I'm so happy!
[both laugh]
You back for long?
I'm back for good.
I'm not on leave,
I've been transferred.
That's great.
I'm not thrilled about it.
I mean, look, I graduated
at the top of my class.
I speak five languages.
And all of that just to
pound pavement for Operation Sentinel.
I mean, that wasn't part of my plan.
I know it wasn't.
But you're here now.
That's what matters, right?
So is that asshole still living up here
on the sixth floor?
- Yeah.
- Still bothering Mom?
Not as much anymore.
[Maria singing softly in Russian]
[singing in Russian]
- Let's eat. I'm starving.
- Shh!
Shh!
[sighs]
[speaking French]
You're finally here.
[laughs]
Mom, you're smothering her.
All right.
I used to make this for your father.
It reminded him of his homeland.
- No!
- No way. Is that true?
[laughs] Now, please dig in.
You're nothing but skin and bones, hmm?
Here, have mine. I'm good.
Don't want it?
Maybe later.
Pa-pa-pa. Ah!
- [laughs]
- Mom!
- Mom, want some?
- No, I'll eat later.
Well, more for me.
Oh, yeah.
[ethereal music playing]
- [ball bouncing]
- [man] One, two, three.
One, two, three. Not bad.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Keep going, come on.
One, two, three.
Pick it up!
[doctor] I see that you were prescribed
a pretty strong opioid
for your migraines,
as well as some sedatives
and beta-blockers.
That's quite a cocktail.
Wouldn't be hard to get hooked.
How about we strike a deal?
I'll refill your prescription,
but only after
you've met with a therapist.
This is for your own good.
Do we have a deal?
- All right.
- Here's the number of a colleague of mine.
Thank you.
[shower running]
[cell doors creaking open]
[cell doors closing]
- Good morning, officer.
- Sir.
I'm Lieutenant Jaubert. Éric.
You're patrolling under my command.
Allow me.
Please, go ahead.
I'll wait. But thanks.
[man] Lieutenant.
- Hello.
- Good morning.
[exhales]
[woman laughing]
[Jaubert] So we'll start with the harbor,
then we'll head to the canal.
- After that, we'll circle back...
- Excuse me, sir.
I'm a little lost.
Could you direct me
to the Negresco Hotel?
There.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
You'll get used to it. That's the gig.
[Jaubert] Anyway, as I was saying,
we'll patrol the harbor,
then head to Garibaldi Plaza.
[percussion music playing]
[sighs]
- [man] Who's this guy, huh?
- [woman] I don't know!
I swear, I don't know!
- [woman 2] Help! Please help!
- [woman 1] Stop!
What the hell?
[woman 2] God, help!
Quickly, please hurry!
- [man] Look at me!
- Requesting backup. Assault in progress.
[woman 2] Hurry! Please hurry!
Poor girl's getting beaten.
He's completely lost it. Hurry.
He's totally wasted.
I swear, he's going to kill her.
Mister, you have to calm down!
Look, the police have been notified.
[woman sobbing]
[man] I'm going to fucking kill you!
[woman 1] Oh, shut the fuck up!
Hey, don't!
- Officer!
- [grunting]
- Officer!
- [yelling]
Hey! We can't do that!
[microwave beeps]
[in Russian] Are you okay, my love?
[sighs]
[in English] Everything's all right,
sweetie.
You're here with us.
We'll take care of you now.
[Tania] Hey!
We're still on for Saturday, right?
Don't leave me hanging.
[both laugh]

[pills rattle]
[car horn honks]
[seagulls squawking]
Hey! How are you doing, handsome?
- [soldier] How are you?

Can I get you boys some coffee?
- [soldier] Please.
- [car horn honks]
- [woman] Let me get that for you.
- [siren blaring distantly]
[man shouting in Arabic]
[gasps]
[panting]
[in English] Officer?
What's wrong?
You got any Oxy or codeine?
You a narc?
- Codeine is 50.
- Okay.
Wait here.
[sighs]
[pop song playing on radio]
Hey, what's that? Is it new?
Yeah. You approve?
I like it.
[giggles] Cool.
[exhales]
What's up with that face?
- Nothing. I'm fine. Let's go.
- No. Look at me.
- No, don't.
- Come on.
Smile.
All right, that's enough.
What am I, a matryoshka?
[in Russian] My beautiful girls!
Yes, beautiful girls.
[Maria in English]
My two beautiful girls together.
- Let's take a photo.
- [Maria] Okay.
[Klara] Oh, perfect. A photo op.
[camera shutters click]
[dance music blaring]
[woman] Hey, girls!
Hey!
What's up?
Oh, hey!
- How are you?
- This is my sister, Klara.
- Oh, the soldier.
- Yeah. How are you?
- Yeah, totally.
- Later.
- Who was that?
- No one.
[dance music continues]
- Come on!
- What? I'm dancing.
- Oh, snap.
- [laughing]
[whooping and cheering]
[man] Tania! Hey!
[laughs]
- Tania!
- Hey!
- What's up?
- What's up, beautiful?
I'm good.
Hey, this is my sister.
- What's up?
- Hi.
- Aurélien.
- Klara.
Who are those guys?
Oh! Whoa!
- Russians.
- Introduce me?
Tania.
- Oh, come on!
- All right, fine.
I'll be right back, okay?
- What? Where are you going?
- She's with me, don't worry.
Tania!
[dance music playing]
TANIA
YOU ALL RIGHT???
WHERE ARE YOU????
[sighs]
Good morning.
Oh. Morning.
I've got to go.
Call me later?
Of course.
[seagulls squawking]
[officer] Open that up.
[man] Can't you see the bag's empty?
[officer] I have to check.
We're conducting a search.
- What's this box?
- It's just a box.
Tiffany's? You got a hot date?
- Open it.
- It's just a box!
[officer] Open the box.
Give me that bag.
- What's all this? What is this?
- [man] Papers. Just papers.
[officer] Just hand it over.
- [man] Why are you hassling me?
- [officer] Do what you're told.
Spread your arms.
- Anything dangerous on your person?
- [man] No, man!
- [officer] What are you doing here?
- [man] Nothing.
Just hanging out with some friends.
See?
[indistinct chatter]
[dramatic music playing]
[panting]
Let it go! Let it go!
Not a cop then, huh?
Get lost.
Go.
Fuck.
[police siren blaring]
He get away?
- I'm sorry.
- Go. Go.
[vehicle receding]
[starts engine]
- Here.
- Thanks.
[exhales]
[children shouting distantly]
[cell phone vibrates]
Hello?
[exhales]
Excuse me, nurse.
Where is my sister?
[heart monitor beeping]
[doctor faint] Your sister's in a
stage-three coma caused by cerebral edema.
It's inoperable.
We're attempting resorption.
[whimpers and sobs softly]
[doctor faint] I'm very sorry.
[woman] Hello.
Captain Muller.
Are you Tania's sister?
Can I have a word?
[heart monitors beeping]
Your sister was found this morning.
Well, a passerby found her
by chance on the beach, and…
Our preliminary examination shows
that she might have been raped as well.
Do you know her whereabouts last night?
I was with her… at Millennium.
Club Millennium?
With friends, or…
No, just the two of us.
But she left before me
with people I didn't know.
[indistinct chatter]
[somber music playing]
[woman] Did you see that shot, though?
The sergeant couldn't believe…
[man] You got it.
- [cocks gun]
- You all right?
I heard about your sister.
I'm so sorry.
[cocks rifle]
I just need five minutes.
[man 1] Right.
Let's just pump up the capacity
by 50 people.
- [man 2] That could work.
- [man 1] And from there we…
Are you the owner?
Yes, can I help you?
I'm here for this club's
security footage.
I'm sorry, for what?
Under whose authority?
Anti-terror squad.
What exactly are you looking for?
[taps keyboard]
How can I see that angle?
Him. There.
Do you know him?
- He was right over there.
- Of course I know him. He's a regular.
[camera shutters click]
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Look, the police already went over
all of this.
Now, please leave
or I'm calling them back.
[man] Officer?
- You good?
- Fine. Come on.
[monitor beeps]
[gunshots]
You hold your breath when you shoot.
You shouldn't.
Try exhaling next time instead.
Coffee?
[muffled gunfire]
He's the one there.
He is the man my sister left with.
He's the one I have to find.
How did you get a hold
of these images?
Let me remind you,
this is an active police investigation.
I apologize.
I couldn't help myself.
His name's Yvan Kadnikov.
In addition to the nightclub footage,
we were also able to find
your sister's mobile phone,
and there were photos
of that night on it.
- Have you questioned him?
- Not yet.
- The request's been made.
- What are you saying?
Yvan Kadnikov is the son
of Leonid Kadnikov.
A tech genius who's made
quite a fortune.
He's a pretty influential man now
who some say is protected.
Since what happened, Yvan's been hiding
in his father's villa.
Problem is,
they have diplomatic passports.
Father and son.
And the villa itself
has consulate status.
They're bulletproof.
[knocks]
Shit. I have to go.
Listen, I'll be honest with you.
Cases like this are complicated.
All we can do is hope
she wakes up,
and maybe she'll remember
what happened.
[man] Let's go.
I'll keep you posted.
[muffled gunfire continues]
[man on radio in Russian]
You only think of food.
[Maria singing softly in Russian]
- [singing continues]
- [monitor beeping]
[both singing softly]
[coughs and gasps]
[pensive music playing]
[cheers and applause]
[in English] What the hell are you doing?
[tense music playing]
Have you completely lost it?
Come on, let's go.
Your weapon.
[man] Understood.
Yeah.
[shower running]
I assumed a soldier with your experience
would want to set an example.
You need to stop getting stoned at work,
officer.
This is the girl's locker room, sir.
[door closes]
[dance music blaring]
- What are you drinking?
- Vodka tonic.
You got it.
[urinating]
[zipper rasps]
[gasps]
[in Russian] My sister's in a coma!
You left with her. What happened?
Huh? Huh?
[man laughing]
[man in English] Oh, fuck.
[footsteps receding]
[grunts]
[in Russian] I'll cut you
unless you tell me.
Stop, please. I did nothing.
- Tell me what you did!
- It wasn't me!
- Tell me.
- [man in English] Yvan?
Let him go.
[all yell and grunt]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[all yell]
[breathing heavily]
[groans]
[both yell]
[groans]
[panting]
[grunting]
[breathing heavily]
What the fuck is this?
Hold on, I know you.
Get this bitch out of here now.

[bottle pops open]
[heart monitor beeping]
[birds tweeting]
[grunts]
- [muffled screaming]
- [water bubbling]
[gasps]
[coughs]
[gasping and panting]
And you are?
What are you doing in my house?
[in Russian] Your son raped my sister.
It's you.
Yvan told me
about your exploits at the club.
Well done!
[in English] You are the one
I should be hiring as my bodyguard, huh?
You just missed Yvan.
He's far away now.
Well, in any case,
he hasn't much to do
with what happened anyway.
Much to my disappointment…
My son Yvan…
Has never been one for women.
Your sister was here.
She was with Yvan
and some friends.
She drank my vodka.
Danced in my living room.
Hell, she even swam in my pool,
practically naked.
[chuckles]
In front of everyone.
And, well…
let's just say…
I don't have my son's affliction.
[spits]
Mmm, that pretty little
tattoo shaped like a diamond, well…
What a memorable feast.
[gasps]
[coughs]
[in Russian] I'm sorry, my dear.
I must take this call.
[in English] I'll leave you in
the company of these lovely gentlemen.
Hello?
[Leonid speaking Russian]
[yells]
[intense music playing]
[in Russian] Shit!
- [sighs]
- [shower running]
I WANT TO BE THE NEW WIND
AFTER THE STORM
[cell phone vibrates]
[in English] Hello?
The young Russian,
he didn't do anything.
I know.
I just want to forget.
I'd been drinking.
I went to his house.
People will say I asked for it.
It's my word against his.
You don't mean that.
If you press charges,
they'll investigate and prove it.
They'll have a trial.
And Kadnikov will be put
behind bars.
Leonid Kadnikov.
I know everything.
I don't want to press charges.
I don't want my life
on display like that.
I won't do that to Mom,
do you get it?
He can't get away with this.
What he's done to you,
he'll do to others.
And he will keep doing it.
Do you get that?
Huh?
Look, I'm tired.
Please just leave now.
[anchor on TV] Live from Nice,
the Kadnikov situation…
[reporters on TV] Mr. Kadnikov!
[reporter] Will you go back to Russia?
[Leonid] Business is calling me away,
but I could never leave the city
without seeing this magnificent church
that was completely renovated
thanks to the great generosity
of our Russian donors.
[reporter] Police sources say
that your son, Ivan,
is the lead suspect
in a rape case right here in Nice.
My son, Yvan,
has nothing to do with any of that.
Clearly some individual was
just trying to make some money.
[reporter] Well, the same source
also claims
that your son is hiding in Paris
at the Georgian Embassy
with your friend Andrey Baranov.
[reporter] Is this why you are
returning to Russia?
To help your son escape the charges
leveled against him?
[reporters] Mr. Kadnikov!
[reporter] Mr. Kadnikov,
please answer the question!
[anchor] Thank you.
Live from Nice,
the Kadnikov situation is still unfolding.
- [monitors beeping rapidly]
- [Tania hyperventilating]
What happened?
[doctor] It's an embolism.
Tania!
Miss, you need to leave.
Please, she'll be fine.
Oxygen.
Five liters, continuous, on a mask.
- Oh, my God.
- Get a heparin pump ready.
Please leave now.
We'll take care of her.

- Thanks.
- [Klara] Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?
I was hoping we could talk.
Yeah. Sure.
[door buzzes open]
- How are you?
- Uh, I'm good.
- What the hell are you doing?
- That bag.
Quickly.
I need two Glocks.
And ammo.
[man] Shit.
- [Klara] And two FAMAS.
- Uh, well…
- Oh, fuck.
- [Klara] With loaded magazines.
[man] Okay.
Shit.
Close the bag now.
You've really lost it.
Put the bag down.
On your knees.
Tie yourself up!
Tie yourself up!
Now, hurry up. Go on.
- [tie zips sharply]
- [man winces]
Don't move.
[man 1] Hello!
- [faintly] Help! In here!
- [man 2] What the hell?
[man 1] The armory!
[Klara] Sir.
Listen, I'll call you back.
All right?
- [man] Somebody help!
- [man on phone] Yeah.
[dramatic music playing]
- [turns off ignition]
- [gear shift cranks]
[cell phone vibrates]
- Hello?
- [Maria] Sweetie…
You okay, Mom?
I'd be better if you were here.
Where are you?
I had to leave.
[in Russian] Come back.
Come back, please.
[in English] It's too late, Mom.
Are the police with you?
Klara?
You're making a huge mistake.
Do what your mother says.
Come back.
The woman who tried
to kill your sister,
she's alive.
She works for Kadnikov.
He'll be arrested.
I promise that.
No.
He has to pay for what he did.
Now.

[thug 2] The police have
closed all the exits.
I want something to eat.
[thug 1] All you want to do is eat.
Okay, I'll bring you something.
[thug laughs]
[gasps]
[thug 1] Hey, listen.
- Do you hear me?
- [thug 2] Yes, I do.
[thug 1] Did you see
the car I bought last week?
[thug 2] Why do you need that?
[thug 1] For driving women around.
[thug 2] I prefer to walk.
[panting]
[thug on radio] Dima? Sasha?
What's happening?
Dima? Sasha?
Are you there?
[gunshot]
