Two cops were killed
He was tried for one only
They robbed a computer store
All accessors were killed, he was wounded
4 years has he spent in prison
He is in the 5th cell-Block
Never made any troubles
respected by other prisoners
Never messes with any shit
A man from Moscow offers good
money to take him out of here
I think it's a crappy deal
Too much to do
... and too risky!
Hard to rely on him
What if he commits crime after he is released?
Cops will get him and we'll be in shit!
So I think we'd better not mess with it
.. Good money offered, though
And we can make it so that no
one will know ... what we did
How much money?
- You remember how much was the last deal?
- Yep
Three times more
cash at once
Huh.. Great money
Great great
Great!
How are we gonna make it...
singing
- Come on, bastard!
- Hey what you doing kolian?
- Calm down kolian! - Son of the bitch!
- Don't beat me, stop it
Fuck you kolian!
Why the hell did you beat me bro?
Enough! Enough! Stop it! I said
Stop it now!
- What?
- Stop it!
Why did you start this, motherfucker?
- Stop!
- Shut up bastard!
How come you started the fight?
- He got the picture from my shelf
- The pict was on the flor!
No! It wasn't on the flor! Even if it
were don't you see that this is mine?
Lier! He ain't sure were it was
I thougth he threw that away
i got the girl out from the pic
- What's the problem?
- Ok! Enogh!
I thought he threw it away
i see the baby on the pict, I got her
Whoudn't you get yourself?
Can I see?
Do you think she is waiting for you?
Such nice girls never wait
for such assholes as us
Who would wait for a prisoner...
forget...
this is my only sister
Dashka!
What the mess on the tables?
Dasha, dasha
Dashka!
Dasha, open this for me!
- Where have you been last night?
- I had a lot to do
You do nothing serious all the time
Your brother got in trouble
i feel you gonna do the same
I am embarraced for you guys
Don't worry uncle mike, kolia will soon
be released and we'll leave you forever
You may start packing up just now
you doin nothin anyway
Only embarracing me
Tell me. What do you do? What?
I wait for kolia
Tomorrow he is released. You follow him to Moscow
once you're in the right place... do a clean job!
Get all the docs from him
Singing
Had a party? You drank all the night
Tomorrow? When is he gonna get to Moscow? Ok.
Kazanskiy railway station? I'll meet him there
Alright. Thanks!
Bye!
Dmitri, it's not your size,
they mistook. Two sizes bigger
- It's not for myself
- Huh...
my friend is getting back from a long trip
Take this too
He would visit my mom and
kicked me out of the house
He would visit my mom and kicked
me out of the house even in winter
Hmm.. Creeppy
Mom wasn't home, he grabbed
me and forced me to the bed
- And then?
- And then...
then what?
One time mom got home
early and saw us together
Oh god...
can you tell that to the camera?
No, I am too shy...
can I borrow money now?
How much you got?
What you gonna do?
Life has changed. Business,
trading no need to rob anymore
I own a car-Trading company.
You can own half of it
You gotta obtain the drivers
lisense and insurance to have wheels
Don't wanna forgive me get money
for living. You are free, you decide
Thank you dimon for everything you did for me
You got kids?
A daughter and a son
Make sure they don't do what we did
And... listen dimon
I don't know what would i've done
if I had been you that time
You're stubborn
No luck
Dimon.. Dimon..
Dimon
Dimon, why?
Dashka, everything is on fire! Crap!
Where you goin? Dashka, stop!
Don't go there. You will burn!
Too late! It's gone
Get out quickly! What are you doin there?
Stop it!
- What are you doin?
- It's hot!
What's this?
Who's this?
Not your business
Who taught you to hide money from me?
This is for kolia. Why didn't you put it out?
You will get where your brother is!
Better that, than flipping
your crappy burgers
Damn ass!
Damn ass
...indeed damn ass
Who knows when she'll get back..
She just left
You know where to look for her?
She drives a silver honda
i don't know the plates
She often goes to the town, not far from here
visits her friend, a daughter of one rich man
I am homeless now
Deposit in a bank the
bills which aren't burned
- They are dirty, a will the bank take'em?
- It should
Listen, I thought that's irina
She is not worth you
- Think so?
- Yep
Look. I just printed yesterday
They are all for sale or for rent
Near the ocean
This is where pineyro comes from
The quality is crappy
original has such fine colors!
Let's go tonight
In the morning we'll get to Moscow, then take the first
flight to gua in 8 hrs we'll be swimming in the ocean!
Fine, dasha
Let's spend all the money in three days
and come back empty
We made not that much
we need to live on this
We wanted to spend it for getting abroad
Dasha, dasha
hey dasha
Leave me
Crap
Hey, dasha, lets make a nice deal for two
months and then we'll enjoy your ocean all life!
You said that we don't
need much money overthere
Like in paradise
Even in paradise
we would need money to survive
I dream how I meet kolia
drive him to the airport
He is asking: where we going?
Then he realizes
and he says...
no, it's not gonna be, the money have burned
It's ok, dasha. It could be even worse
You don't know hard was it to earn this money
I know, at least I imagine how hard
If you know, then shut up
not your business
When is he gonna be released?
This fall. I didn't get letters for a
while. May be he's gonna make a surprise!
I'll make him a surprize myself!
Listen.. How much you need to go abroad?
Do you really care?
I know a rich man, who cheats his wife let's
make a tape of his phone calls to black mail him
And then we'll ask for 20 grands
10 yours and 10 mine
Hey, ksukha, why you wanna mess with it?
Do you need it?
- How come you know that he has such money?
- He does have!
How come you know?
He's my father, he cheats my mom
spends all the money with another woman
Ksusha, I sure?
Dasha, I know you need the money, right?
He's your father!
So what? We are not gonna kill him ...
and i, his daughter, will get some money
He spends thousands on that bitch
while I have to beg every dollar from him
- You sure they will come over?
- Of course, I promised them such a good deal!
- How many of'em?
- Doesn't matter, check this out man!
Oh!
Very nice!
Hide it!

Look at this
Dashka, let's go away from here
Turn the wheel
You know.. In childhood we went to the south resorts
every year mom would always cook chickens before the trip
A train hasn't departed yet but we
start lunch meet other passengers
I would always take the top bed
one night I fell down
I took the train only once when uncle
mike took me and kolia from Moscow
In childhood we lived on peace blvd. In
Moscow once mom and dad flew to novosibirsk
The airplain crashed
From all the relatives only unlce mike
took care of us brought us to his town
You were friends with kolia?
We lived in the same block.
He was a really good guy
He is the only one from my family... he was
He got in prison because he
protected me and stabbed a man
Once in winter we were in a cafe, the road was under snow no cars
but there is a truck with a picture of palms, sun, sea, like paradise
There is no paradise in life
I wanna go to paradise
I'll get money and go
Where? India? Africa? Rio de janeiro? Don't
be naive. Who is waiting for you over there?
Who is waiting for me here...
prison?
You can always start a new life
Which new life? The same as sitting on
this tramway and waiting for it to leave
You think it's better to
ride elephants in africa?
What can I do here? Sell junk in the streets?
Why selling junk? You can try anything
For instance?
You don't know?
Think of it. What do you like to do?
Writing sms
What about sms?
Have you been to baycal?
I haven't
you?
Not necessary baycal. When i'll go somewhere I will send you sms
but i'll have to think how to describe everything in a few words
Bright yellow sun, blue
sky, golden sand, warm ocean
Actually... no...
Hello kostia. I'm in
paradise. It's so quiet here
Do you know if there is any car
market close by? I wanna sell x-5
You sure?
I don't need him
I'll go to cemetry to my friends and then go back to ilya his friend
is a supervisor in northen fleet. I'll get a job there and a new life
You need to go away from
here. Cops are looking for you
Not in paradise, but somewhere closer
go to baycal for instance
I wanna go there. But it's better
to take baycal and go abroad
Yep, also altai, kamchatka, murmansk and everything take with
you to some beautiful country then it's gonna be a perfect place!
Then what will be left in russia?
Only cops
- How much?
- No idea I don't sell
Can you sell it though?
I don't know the price
You can take it for free
Thank you
Enjoy it
Sir, could you please help me open the hood?

Hi dashka
It's so quiet here
No goodness no evil when wolves
are praying god gives them prey
No bravery no fear when a bullet is
in the heart only the t-Shirt torn
No love no hatred when you
can save youself or save no one
