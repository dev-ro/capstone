Core and countdown one
in two hours, 57 minutes.
The crew has arrived
at the pad on schedule.
Copy.
Dragon's healthy
and ready for crew ingress.
You're looking at the rocket
that will return American astronauts
to the International Space Station
from American soil
for the first time
since nearly nine years ago.
Today's mission is known as
Demonstration Mission-2, or Demo-2.
Demo-2 is the final test for NASA
to certify SpaceX
for regular crew flights
to the space station.
Core and countdown one
in T-minus two hours and 46 minutes.
The crew has arrived at the White Room.
Its ingress is in progress on schedule.
Dragon has transitioned to
terminal count and is on internal power.
Stage one locks load, close out.
Earth is the cradle of humanity,
but you cannot stay in the cradle forever.
It is time to go forth,
be out there among the stars,
expand the scope and scale
of human consciousness.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.
There's this little candle
of consciousness on Earth.
It hasn't been around for very long,
and it could easily go out.
It could be a meteor,
extreme climate change.
Who knows? A third world war.
Clearly, we need to preserve
the light of consciousness into the future
by becoming a multi-planet species,
extending life beyond Earth.
Before starting SpaceX,
I was waiting for NASA
to send people up to Mars.
Every year, I'd look at the NASA website,
and I was like, "Well, it's hard to f..."
There just didn't seem
to be a date
for when we're sending people to Mars.
In fact, uh, space, you could say, like,
"Look, we were able
to go to the Moon in '69,
and our last mission to the Moon
was in '72."
"And now here we are half a century later,
and still we have not gone
back to the Moon."
The absolutely fundamental breakthrough
that's needed for humanity
to become a multi-planet species
is a rocket system
that's fully and rapidly reusable.
- Yeah.
- So, uh...
For 50 years,
NASA has been left behind.
As the NASA administrator,
I will tell you,
that is a failure of our nation.
But now, through our partnership
with commercial companies like SpaceX,
we have the opportunity to fix that.
If Mission Demo-2 is successful,
we'll launch American astronauts
on American rockets from American soil
for the first time in nine years.
The ability
to once again send our astronauts
to the International Space Station
is the first step
in getting humans ready to go to Mars.
Good morning,
safety divers EV-1 and 2. How do you copy?
Copy safety divers EV-1,
copy safety divers EV-2, going to backup.
Five GPH and work on the blue.
Alarms have been enabled,
and we show no alarms that impact testing.
Hey, Bob,
you're gonna need a Bravo 7.
Okay.
Bob and I, we're laser-focused
on what we need to do
to get Dragon safely to Space Station
and then, you know, our mission
on board Space Station after that.
We've been close friends
since we started as astronauts
almost 20 years ago.
- That feel better?
- Yep. That's good.
Doug's a meticulous pilot
and extremely skilled at the same time.
It's a... a rare person that kinda
can put both skills together
where not only are they super good,
but they're also super good
at staying out of trouble.
He's a Marine, right? And so he does have
some of the stereotypical, uh, things
about a Marine, so you need to know that.
Everything has a place, and I like things
organized and symmetrical,
and Bob... Bob's just...
He doesn't have time for that stuff.
It's just an override.
It allows you to bypass...
He's got a tighter sense of hygiene
than I do, I think.
"Do you really want it cleaned that well?"
"Yes, I do."
Try to give you as much flying
as possible today, just to show you...
Bob's got an incredible mind.
He's just always
a little bit ahead of everybody else.
He's very analytical, very mechanical,
which I think is why he's been
such a successful spacewalker.
He pictures it,
yet he has the ability, mechanically,
to do those things.
I'll just get
to another handrail over here.
Bob expects a lot out of himself.
We set pretty high bars
for ourselves and each other.
You got a lot you need to get done,
and there's a lot of people
that are counting on you to get it done.
How confident are you
that we'll see humans launch from US soil
this year or in the summer?
Um, it's been 17 years,
and we still haven't launched anyone yet.
But hopefully, we will later this year.
Seems like you're feeling good
about flying on it.
Yeah, I think this is...
this is what you wanna see.
You wanna see the team hitting its stride,
uh, as we get ready
to put people on these things.
Elon, you've got these two guys
sitting right next to you.
Any thoughts on that,
how you're gonna get through that launch?
I suspect it'll be extremely stressful,
but we've been very focused on
just making sure that the vehicle works.
We definitely won't launch till we've done
everything we can possibly think of,
that's for sure.
We are doing everything we can
to make these vehicles
as safe as possible,
because my generation,
we... we remember a catastrophe.
I remember exactly where I was in 1986
when the Challenger exploded.
I was in Miss Powers' fifth grade class.
This was the mission
with Christa McAuliffe,
a teacher going into space.
They brought in the TVs.
Challenger, go with throttle-up.
What appears
to be a major catastrophe
in America's space program,
Challenger, only seconds
after leaving the launchpad,
has exploded in midair.
No word yet on if there are any survivors.
Spaceflight
is an unforgiving environment.
You know, you're riding
a controlled bomb into space,
and you're accelerating
to 17,500 miles an hour.
Obviously, there is inherent risk.
With all of our experience
on the NASA side,
having dealt with the risk,
Doug and I were a good fit,
I think, for SpaceX.
That experience
with the actual loss of a crew
was something that they felt was important
for the crew members
that were gonna work
on developing a new vehicle.
Do you do it on the back one
normally, Bob?
You know, Bob and I have been working
with SpaceX for five years.
We're involved with the design.
And, of course, one of the things
that we wanted Dragon to have
that shuttle didn't have
is the abort system.
If something goes really, really wrong...
we'll be automatically separated
from the booster
and parachute back down into the Atlantic.
Today is the uncrewed test
of this abort system.
Good morning, everybody.
We are now actually live.
It's awesome,
but I'm also just a little bit sad.
I don't wanna see a rocket
intentionally blow up
and sacrifice itself for the safety
of humankind's going to space,
but sometimes, that's what you gotta do,
you know, so...
I've been doing this full-time on YouTube
for almost three years.
I'll move closer
so you have a sense of scale.
The point of Everyday Astronaut
is to bring space down to Earth
for everyday people.
We're gonna be trying to track
the rocket with this...
Thirty-five percent of my audience
is in the United States.
Sixty-five percent
is an international audience.
And so spaceflight
is literally uniting people
around this common goal
of space exploration.
It's not... it's not just one person
or one country. It is humanity.
You're exploring together.
T-minus ten.
Five, four, three, two, one,
ignition.
Look at that!
We are in this. We are doing this.
Yes!
Whoo!
Yes! Look at that!
Car alarms are going off!
Car alarms are going off!
Oh, those clouds
might ruin our shots here.
Here we go.
It's gonna happen right now in the clouds.
No!
We have to watch SpaceX's stream.
Vehicle is supersonic
and passing through
maximum dynamic pressure.
Dragon launch escape initiated.
Dragon's away.
Okay, the major activity coming up.
Okay,
you just saw a bright flash there.
It looks like Falcon 9 breaking up.
And there they are. Drogue chutes are out.
Another amazing milestone
is complete.
This was a very successful test.
It looked beautiful.
Yeah, obviously, I'm super fired up.
This is great, you know?
I was wondering how much data
you were able to get after the breakup.
We lost telemetry
on the first stage
shortly after it exploded.
There's definitely not any big pieces
of the rocket left.
Hi. Loren Grush with The Verge.
The explosion that happened today
with the Falcon 9,
what would happen
if an explosion like that occurred
while the Crew Dragon was still attached?
Is there any concern about that happening?
It's much more a fireball
than it is an explosion.
It should be, uh, really
not significantly affected by a fireball.
So it could quite literally,
like something out of Star Wars,
fly right out of the fireball.
Um, so that's, uh...
Obviously, we wanna avoid...
avoid doing that, but...
Well, thank you, all.
Elon,
doesn't this deserve a dance today?
Come on.
I... I can't set these expectations,
uh, of... of dancing constantly.
- I... I'm not that good of a dancer.
- You are!
- I'm gonna have to work on my skills.
- You are.
No, no. I... I am not your dancing puppet.
I'll tell you what,
after crew launch, 100%.
All right, it's good to see everyone.
What we did this morning
was almost a final exam for the system
we're gonna fly here in a very short time.
There's certainly
a fair amount of work left to do.
We've got final simulations.
But just to see the in-flight abort
and think about flying rockets again
to the space station,
it's unbelievable.
I mean, nine years ago,
you know, I was the pilot
on the last shuttle flight.
At that point, I didn't know
if I was ever gonna fly again.
We're about to see something
that none of us will ever see again,
the launch of a space shuttle.
On the 135th and final
space shuttle mission,
the shuttle program coming to an end
after 30 years of flight.
Space shuttle
spreads its wings one final time
for the start of a sentimental journey
into history.
Houston station,
Atlantis on the big loop.
Atlantis...
Flying high
over the Atlantic Ocean
off the west coast of Africa,
as we watch Doug Hurley
up on the flight deck of Atlantis.
I remember the last night
we were in space.
Right before I went to bed, you know,
just looking out the overhead window
of the shuttle...
you know, you could just see,
I mean, literally see out into the galaxy.
And to see what's over that next bend
and around that next curve
is why I originally got
into this business.
And, you know, knowing
it was the last flight of the shuttle,
just looking out and thinking about
what was gonna happen after that,
uh, it was pretty tough.
With its signature sound
of twin sonic booms
piercing the predawn sky
as the space shuttle announces
its arrival at the launch site,
having gone subsonic for the last time.
Hurley now deploying the drag chute.
Hey, thanks to you
and your team, Mike.
Until the very end,
you all made it look easy.
The shuttle's always gonna be a reflection
of what a great nation can do
when it dares to be bold
and commits to follow through.
When I became
Deputy Administrator of NASA,
anybody who looked at it knew
that we had to retire
the space shuttle program.
It was very expensive.
You know, we had already spent
hundreds of billions of dollars
building it and keeping it going.
And it was also dangerous.
We'd lost astronauts twice.
To replace the shuttle,
we ultimately ended up
launching with the Russians in Russia.
The American space agency
signed a new contract.
The US will pay
about $82 million to Russia
for every astronaut on board a flight
to the International Space Station.
On the New York media tour,
Stephen Colbert asked the crew,
"So what would you tell a kid today
growing up who wants to be an astronaut?"
And Sandy Magnus answers,
"Learn Russian."
Three, two, one, zero.
Oh goodness.
The end of an era in Florida.
One of Cape Canaveral's
most storied launch sites
was imploded this morning.
Forty years of space history
is being dismantled and demolished,
just one more sign that human spaceflight
is coming to an end.
It was really a tumultuous time,
I think, especially for the astronauts.
Things were changing pretty drastically,
and we weren't really sure
kinda what was gonna happen.
We needed something very different,
so we had to create a new program,
which required
turning to the private sector.
We will partner with industry,
we will invest
in cutting-edge research and technology,
and by 2025,
we expect new spacecraft
designed for long journeys
to allow us to begin
the first-ever crewed missions
beyond the Moon into deep space.
And a landing on Mars will follow.
And I expect to be around to see it.
Thank you.
I thought
tapping into the private sector
was really a symbol of innovation.
Of course, there were
a lot of questions and concerns.
Like if companies are on the Moon,
does that mean they own it?
So I thought we'd need new laws,
but I was pretty sure that
the private sector
would get us over the hump.
Getting everybody to agree
was the challenge.
I want order in this hearing room.
I find serious flaws
in the president's proposal
that relies on
a still-developing commercial sector
that may not be able to deliver.
Safety has been...
You know, change is hard.
The relentless momentum of the status quo
of a tens-of-billions-of-dollar
government program
is a lot to overcome...
...and people
went batshit crazy on us.
The proposal by the administration...
...is a bad idea.
...will be, in a word, devastating.
Many of the companies are start-ups.
We're not sending
cases of Tang into space.
Future generations will learn
how the Chinese, the Russians,
and even the Indians took the reins
of human space exploration away...
The industry feared new entrants.
You're in the club
if you're a big aerospace company.
There's a lot of revolving doors
between astronauts
who then go to companies,
and it became us versus them.
I want to welcome
Mr. Neil Armstrong,
who was commander of Apollo 11,
Eugene Cernan,
who was commander of Apollo 17.
And we will start with you, Mr. Armstrong.
There will be overlooked requirements
and unwelcome consequences.
This proposal has no focus
and is, in fact, a blueprint
for a mission to nowhere.
- You had to hold me down in my seat.
- I was... I was so... I was so upset.
And I was not the only one.
I was very sad to see that, uh,
because those guys are... Yeah.
You know, those guys are heroes of mine,
so it's really tough.
They inspired you to do this, didn't they?
Yes.
And to see them
casting stones in your direction...
It's difficult.
I... I wish they would come and visit
and see what we're doing here.
And I think that would change their mind.
Why is this not working?
I've worked for SpaceX for years now.
Can't turn it on.
And in that time, of course,
SpaceX has had lots of successes.
Come on.
But also, you know,
it's had its fair share of failures.
For many failures that we had, I felt like
we could have done better here or there.
But this is what the business is, right?
You make mistakes,
and you fix them the next time.
Okay, you see it works.
The great thing about Elon
is that he understands that failure
is part of the development,
and he's been that way
ever since the day I met him.
I decided one day
to go to an amateur rocket weekend.
All right, let's go. Let's go fly.
We ran into Elon Musk there
and talked a little bit about rockets
and... and plans what to do.
And then he asked me
if I'd be interested
in working at a company
to build a rocket and go to Mars.
If you say Mars in Germany,
people will just laugh at you
and think you're crazy.
It took me ten milliseconds
to just say yes.
In a warehouse
near the Los Angeles Airport,
Musk and his staff are building a rocket
they call the Falcon.
Musk is no rocket scientist.
He's a dot-com millionaire
many times over.
Now he says he can do what NASA has not,
jump-start the space age.
I... I had somewhere in the order
of 100 million to invest...
Oh wow.
...and thought we could
at least do some good
for the advancement of space exploration.
Falcon 1 is expected
to launch this fall.
Elon Musk's fortune will be riding on it.
Hans introduced me to Elon.
And I'd been in this industry
for 15 years,
and I saw what could be done
and wasn't being done.
And I really felt like, if anyone
was gonna break through the mire
of a very bureaucratic industry,
Elon and SpaceX
was kind of the last opportunity.
These are dispersed rocket parts.
Parts for the stages,
parts for the engines.
I remember
the early days of SpaceX.
It was a small team.
But when you can all
rally around one project,
magic can happen.
We were all focused
on exactly the same thing,
getting Falcon 1 to orbit.
On the fuel side, we're gonna add
a port rather than mess with the valve.
So we'll just...
Designing an orbital rocket,
it's... it's not the mad scientist,
like, "Yeah, I've got the idea." It's...
It's just a monumental amount of work.
Everything, the engines,
software, hardware,
down to the nuts and bolts,
was redesigned for the modern era.
It's extremely difficult
to build a rocket from scratch.
Falcon 1 is a two-stage rocket.
Basically, the rocket launches,
and the first stage burns out.
The two stages separate,
and the second stage ignites
to get to orbit.
And rockets are unforgiving.
One design error,
and... and everything is... is over.
At that point, I was not sure
whether success was even possible.
I told the team
I'd have enough money for three flights,
and then that'll be it, you know.
Curtains if we didn't make it
in three flights.
We understood what was on the line.
So we worked on it for four years.
I had no doubts ever.
I was just so focused
on building the company
and... and getting...
getting the rocket to fly.
Five, four,
three, two, one, zero.
Plus one, plus two, plus three, plus four,
plus five, plus six, plus seven,
plus eight, plus nine, plus ten.
This is the LC on the countdown net.
Falcon 1 is airborne at this time.
We have a loss of signal there.
About 30 seconds after liftoff,
the engine shut itself off.
The really hard part
was collecting the pieces the next day.
We'd worked on it for years,
and suddenly everything was over.
I came back home after a couple days,
and my wife told me
I did not talk at home for two months.
I had... It took me...
It took me so long to just get over this
and... and... and collect myself
and then continue working
on... on rocket number two.
Five, four, three, two, one.
A year later,
our second attempt failed.
And the year after our second attempt,
our third launch failed,
and we knew the company
was in a bad place.
We were running on fumes
at that point. We had virtually no money.
Uh, that was... that was definitely
the worst year of my life.
And I never thought
I was someone who could ever
be capable of a nervous breakdown,
but I... I felt this is the closest
I've ever come,
'cause it... it seemed pretty, pretty dark.
I was pretty depressed at the time.
You know, three failures in a row,
um, wasn't really a testament
of... of great engineering.
Elon pulled us in a big conference room,
and I expected him to say,
"You guys suck,"
and stop it at this point,
but he was just the opposite.
He was actually saying,
"I want you guys to fix everything
and launch another rocket
as fast as you can."
He put all the money
that he had into SpaceX
and was doubling down,
basically, on... on... on this.
And... and I was really,
"Whoa, okay, that's, uh..."
I didn't expect that.
T-minus 30 seconds.
Deck one is triggered.
I knew NASA
was watching our flights,
and so we needed to get Falcon 1 to orbit
to prove that we could earn the right
to work with them.
I think Elon
was even more nervous, um, than I was.
Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
We have liftoff.
Oh fuck.
Come on, baby.
Please tell me that's second-stage lights.
- Fuck. Thanks.
- We're already 2B.
Thank fucking God.
I mean, whatever.
Thank whoever. Fuck.
Come on. Just fucking hold, you fucker.
It's hard getting to orbit,
but we learned a lot on flight one,
we learned a lot on flight two,
and we learned a huge amount
on flight three.
And we were ready to fly.
Second stage approaching SECO.
And that would be a nominal SECO...
...which means Falcon 1's the first
privately developed launch vehicle
to reach Earth orbit from the ground.
This is one of the greatest days
of my life,
and I think probably
for... for most people here.
We've shown people we can do it,
and this is just the first step of many,
ultimately getting to Mars.
And I think the future of SpaceX
is really great.
In the history of spaceflight,
only four entities
have launched a space capsule into orbit
and successfully brought it
back to the Earth,
the United States, Russia,
China, and Elon Musk.
NASA called and told us
that we'd won the $1.5 billion contract.
And I couldn't even hold the phone.
I was like... I just blurted out,
"I love you guys."
SpaceX again
successfully launched its Falcon rocket.
Today will be
the fifth Falcon 9 launch.
Today we'll be placing
a communication satellite...
...a TV satellite into space.
23 satellites,
geostationary orbit.
- SpaceX...
- SpaceX...
SpaceX plans to launch
a dozen commercial satellites a year.
SpaceX may be in the lead
to win NASA's confidence,
but SpaceX isn't alone.
- You're creating, like, spaceships.
- Yeah.
Yes!
Musk and Bezos
are dueling for contracts
to supply the International Space Station.
The third space billionaire, Branson,
wants to create
a space tourism industry for hefty fees.
You wouldn't imagine
that something shaped like that
would fly so gracefully
and so beautifully.
Somehow it all
seems a little less noble
than in the early days.
Perhaps space travel today
is all about money and ego.
Thanks for not lighting
this place on fire.
You're welcome.
How does one decide
to just make a flamethrower?
Well, I'm a big fan
of Spaceballs the movie,
and in Spaceballs,
Yogurt goes through
the merchandising section,
and they have a flamethrower.
- Spaceballs the Flamethrower!
- Ooh!
The kids love this one.
Does anybody tell you no?
Does anybody go, "Elon, um...
...selling a flamethrower, the liabilities"?
Yeah, it's a terrible idea. Terrible.
I said, "Don't buy
this flamethrower. Don't buy it."
Still, people bought it.
I just couldn't stop them.
Elon......you know,
he's gonna do what he's gonna do.
I mean, he has an Iron Man suit
in the middle of the factory floor.
How does it work? Do people
get upset at you if you do certain things?
There's tobacco and marijuana in there.
That's all it is.
Oh, here we go.
Elon Musk back making headlines.
That is his specialty.
Elon was out there,
you know, creating lots of stories.
And so I didn't have any reason
to believe at first he'd be the one.
Now he took a lot of heat
for smoking marijuana on camera.
He was ridiculed
for his wild middle-of-the-night tweets.
What is going on with Elon Musk?
He's an eccentric billionaire, I suppose.
So an eccentric sense of humor as well.
He's a human,
just like the rest of us.
You know,
we all have our pluses and minuses.
To be out there among the stars,
I... I find that incredibly exciting.
That makes me glad to be alive.
But I don't think it has anything
to do with individual antics
or individual wealth.
This is a much greater vision
that he has
for not only society but the planet.
That hasn't changed.
And he demands a lot
of everyone around him,
I think as much as he demands
out of himself,
and, you know, he's relentless.
You decided to build a space company.
Why on Earth would someone do that?
Got that question a lot. That's true.
The big innovation is still ahead,
and you're working on it now.
Tell us... tell us about this.
Uh, the goal of SpaceX is to try to crack
a problem that I think is vital
for humanity to become
a spacefaring civilization,
which is to have
a... a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.
The space shuttle
was an attempt at a reusable rocket.
But even the main tank
of the space shuttle
was thrown away every time.
So it's possible to achieve, let's say,
roughly a hundredfold improvement
in the cost of spaceflight
if you can effectively reuse the rocket.
A general estimate
of how much we have spent
in human spaceflight since Apollo
is around $350 billion,
and we send
about 350 US astronauts to space.
So it's about a billion dollars a person.
So being able to lower that cost
is just such an obvious goal,
or you're never going to go anywhere.
In order to make spaceflight cheap,
and in order to land on Mars
and do all these things,
you have to have a fully reusable rocket.
It's really common in space movies
and science fiction to see...
Retros on!
...you know,
the sci-fi vision of the rocket
that can take off and land anywhere.
That's so far away
from what was even considered possible.
Like, that's
really, really, really hard to do.
In fact, no one had ever tried
to land an orbital booster.
Landing a rocket certainly seemed absurd
when we first started trying it.
To get it right,
you have to set down this thing
that is the size of a skyscraper
and weighing 30 tons
and land it on this speck
in the middle of the ocean.
At any point,
any part of that can go wrong,
and it'll only end one way,
which is in an explosion.
SpaceX is not afraid of failure.
They almost embrace failure.
"Hey, we're gonna test this.
It might blow up."
"If it blows up, we'll learn something."
The way a traditional partner
with NASA works,
everything all along the way
is qualified
before it ever gets on the vehicle.
SpaceX does things very differently.
The two philosophies
couldn't be more opposite.
You'll see NASA
literally solving everything on paper,
and SpaceX is literally building stuff,
seeing what breaks,
and then iterating from there.
They're developing a rocket
around those explosions.
That's why it's important to have a lot
of launches and make a lot of rockets.
Every rocket, every launch
is an opportunity to improve.
Obviously, we get unhappy
about failures that we have,
but we also are pleased with the results
that come out of failures.
You never know your system
until you've pushed it to the limit
so that it breaks.
One of the reasons
people had imagined reusable rockets
but had never achieved it
is that we'd never cracked
precision landing.
After the rocket launches,
the booster stage separates
and then flips around
to shoot back towards Earth.
So we had to figure out
how to get a rocket that's moving
seven times the speed of sound
back to its target.
First, we developed the legs,
the engines, the actuators and sensors,
and some very advanced algorithms.
Finally, we added grid fins.
By rotating these fins,
we precisely guide
and fly the rocket back to the target.
At the very last minute,
we light the engines one more time
for the landing burn
to slow the rocket
all the way down for landing,
hopefully right in the middle of the X.
Six, five, four,
three, two, one, zero.
Liftoff of Falcon 9.
Falcon 9 has cleared the tower.
Stage separation confirmed.
The first stage
is returning to land.
- Stage one landing burn.
- Stage one landing burn.
Thousands of people
worked on the booster landing.
Seven years was entirely
about getting that booster to land.
When that thing finally came down
and did a picture-perfect landing
right on the target,
it's just one of those moments...
...that you will carry
for the rest of your life.
- It's standing up. It's standing up.
- It's standing up.
Oh my God.
Look at this.
It's just sitting there.
Holy smokes, man.
To see them doing this
over and over and over
and hitting these bull's-eye targets,
it's just an absolute testament
to the... the engineering involved.
Elon and SpaceX
changed our industry completely.
Because everything is reusable,
they can now launch for a tenth
of the cost that we had,
which saves a lot of tax dollars.
Launching in the midst
of a coronavirus pandemic,
it's been a challenge.
But we're gonna persevere through this.
We're gonna get Bob and Doug
safely to the International Space Station.
Because this mission
to once again launch
our astronauts from American soil,
it's really about hope.
It's about looking up and saying,
"Look, we can still do amazing things,
even when we're being challenged in ways
that we've never been challenged before."
Bob and Doug are going into quarantine
with their families
in the lead-up to launch day.
This quarantine period
is normal for any launch.
Though I guess
not much will change for them
since they've been in some form
of quarantine since March.
We entered the quarantine period,
so it's hands-off to the rest of the world
until we get back
from the International Space Station.
- How's it look?
- Looks good to me.
I'm guessing we're not gonna have this
on Space Station, right?
Mm-mm.
You know, everything
that you know and love is down there,
and you're up here.
And then hopefully everything will work
so I can get back down there, uh,
to see 'em again.
Mom, you're walking. I thought we...
I'm gonna catch you.
I wanna make sure
that I focus on my family,
you know, this being
kind of my last opportunity.
Oh yeah,
I might be living up there in two weeks.
Sure.
Remember when
you saw Mommy on this thing?
Yeah.
Probably nobody knows more about
what the astronauts are going through,
of course, other than another astronaut.
Copy.
Oh, nice silhouette on the door.
Bob and I, you know,
we're both married to astronauts.
My wife, Karen, she's got two flights.
After my shuttle flight
to the space station,
I was not fulfilled completely.
I... I wanted more, you know.
And so I went back up there
for six months.
Hey, you guys.
- Hey, you guys. Good to see you.
- Hey.
Every day was varied,
but the main objective
was to conduct science
in a zero-gravity environment.
I mean, the station is basically
a huge laboratory that's built in space.
Any experiments where we interacted
with the researchers on the ground,
that was always fun because
you could just feel their excitement
and how these experiments help
to figure out what's happening on Earth.
Because of the tremendous amount
of time Karen was on board the ISS,
there were people years later saying,
"Hey, I found your wife's hair up here."
I'm like, "Well, well, sorry."
What a beautiful spaceship
we're on, guys.
My wife, Megan,
flew on a space shuttle mission
to the Hubble Space Telescope.
Clear the pin.
Five seconds, the mode switch is in auto.
Three, two, one, release.
My mission was the final servicing
and repair mission for the telescope.
We would joke and say, "We're helping
to unlock the mysteries of the universe,"
but it really is true.
So whenever I see an article in the paper
where a group of scientists
have discovered something new,
I always think, you know, "Hey, you helped
a little bit with that."
Before any of us
actually got into space,
Bob and Megan and Karen and I,
we were all classmates.
And so we spent a lot of time together.
So far, so good on
the ascent of the space shuttle Atlantis
on this its 22nd mission,
the 99th flight in space shuttle history.
One of the astronauts
from the class ahead of us
hosted a party
to celebrate the incoming class,
and I first met Doug at that party.
We were friends first.
It... it took a few years
to become more than that, but, um...
Yeah, I think we were lucky, though,
to find each other.
I remember actually
the first time I really heard about Bob.
We each received kind of this pamphlet
that showed everyone's picture
and, like, a two-sentence bio.
He was born in this year,
and he graduated in this year,
and he got a PhD by this year.
He's got to be some kind of,
you know, child prodigy.
And he said, "Well, there's actually
a typo in there with the dates,"
But I think you'll find
that he is a prodigy.
But over time,
I think it became clear
that we were gonna build a life together.
Had a chance to come out
to the old astronaut beach house today.
I'm really looking forward to spending
some time with my family out here
before launching on Dragon
in just a few short days.
You know, I think the thing
that's most important to us right now
is that we are living every day normally.
We're just enjoying time together
as we get closer and closer to launch.
Blastoff!
Oh, that was our new DM-2 tradition
with our sons
to launch rockets from the beach.
Thank you.
- Hey. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.
- Bye-bye.
As we approach liftoff,
I'm just kind of feeling
sort of joy tinged with terror,
I guess is the best way
that I can describe it.
It's like every other trip, over-packing.
Being the person watching,
especially having been a crew member,
it's all out of your control.
There's nothing you can do
other than watch,
and it's... it's definitely a lot harder.
- None of these I would ever want.
- You gonna grow a mustache?
The best your family can do
is break even, right? You come back.
- Never want a what?
- Never had a mustache.
I have wrestled with that.
But in the end, ultimately,
you want your child to understand
that during your life,
there are things that are risky,
but if it results in a better world,
maybe it's worth that risk.
So what you're looking at here
is our main stage
for the launch broadcast.
We've got three cameras,
then what you don't see is the fourth one.
- We'll have a jib out here as well.
- Okay.
They're putting together
a Launch America banner
that will be brought up
directly behind our hosts.
Behind that,
you'll get a little NASA in there.
You'll get a little of the American flag
in there as our backdrop.
So you got layers of depth
to work with, which is kinda nice.
And where we go from here
is the full dress rehearsal,
as if it were live.
This is the point
when the launch escape system is armed,
and that happens just before SpaceX
begins fueling the Falcon 9 rocket
at T-minus 35 minutes.
As a reminder, the purpose...
Right, I'm gonna interrupt Lauren
because it looks like we've had
some type of anomaly on the pad.
We have a developing situation
with our launch operations.
We've taken a pause
for our NASA and SpaceX teams
to gather information.
We are not going away.
We're gonna stay here on this pad shot,
so please stay with us.
Would we really hold on the disaster?
In terms of what, when you say hold?
Like, would we just watch it...
Like, if it's a flaming mess,
we just watch the rocket explode?
So depending on when
and how it plays itself out,
we'd probably be cutting to a wide shot
and watching this thing happen.
Can we cut to a control room or something?
We couldn't cut away.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Ugh!
Couldn't cut away.
- Uh, we would get...
- Hey, look at that.
Static fire happening right now.
So it looks like they have had
successful static fire of the rocket.
That's where they hold the rocket down
and actually light up its engines
to make sure all things are good to go.
And it looks like that has gone smoothly.
This is my sign.
This is when I was gonna hit the road,
because that means they're still on track
to actually be launching here.
I have to pack masks.
It's a freaking pandemic.
This is the actual warning label,
like on the International Space Station,
the hatches.
I mean, even space underwear.
I am... I'm a nerd.
Now, with humans flying, starting to get
a little... a little nervousness
because I have watched rockets fail.
Just today, Virgin Orbit
had their first orbital launch attempt,
and it failed.
And it sucks. Space is hard.
There's still so many moving parts,
and there's so many things
that can go wrong.
And, of course,
I have a lot of confidence in the systems,
but it...
There is a real sense of... of importance.
There's a real sense of danger now.
It's getting a lot more real now.
With primary day tomorrow,
it's looking a little wishy-washy.
Um, all the models are showing
some isolated storms
just west of the staging area that...
Yeah, you can see the map.
That's the front approaching.
Looks pretty scary.
The, uh, risk for, uh, the launch corridor
went up to 47%,
in the high category.
I was gonna suggest maybe Ben,
since he compiled this,
what would be his recommendation?
Looking at just wind and waves
at this point,
I... I feel like it's within a risk level
that we would accept.
Um, but based
on the... the rain, the lightning,
it's driving the numbers
quite a bit higher.
Weather is very,
you know, fickle in Florida.
Some of the most intense lightning
I've seen in the world
happens at Cape Canaveral.
My job, at the end of the day,
is to make sure
that the risk is acceptable
and give the final go-ahead
for the mission.
I basically have to have
nerves of steel.
It's terrifying when you, like, say, like,
"Yeah, go for launch."
It's gonna be
right on the edge, probably.
We got to be crisp
on this thing going forward.
Thunderstorms are such a big issue
because our launch to the space station
is an instantaneous launch window.
Basically, we have to wait
for the Earth to rotate
until station is directly overhead
and then launch at that exact millisecond.
Any problems it's like,
"Oh, we're scrubbed."
You know, "We're not gonna go fly."
In addition
to all those weather factors,
one of the most nerve-racking moments
is loading propellant
with astronauts on board.
We're basically loading, like,
a million pounds of, like, fuel and oxygen
into this big tank,
and the astronauts are sitting on top.
A rocket is an energetic system,
and anything leaking
can be pretty catastrophic.
We have had an incident in the past...
We destroyed the satellite,
we destroyed the rocket,
we destroyed the launchpad,
and it took us months
to figure out what... what happened.
The rocket blew up, but it was not caused
by the fueling process, per se.
It was caused by a pressure tank.
I didn't expect it to fail that traumatic.
When you work on this,
you really hope it works.
I'm cautiously optimistic
about tomorrow.
There's nothing more we can think of
to improve the probability of success.
But I don't wanna tempt fate.
There's always things
you don't know about,
so you don't know
when those are gonna come and get you.
Um...
Making sure Bob and Doug are safe
is not simply our first priority.
It is our only priority.
So at the top of the hour,
we're gonna make
another judgment on the weather.
But remember, thunderstorms down here
in Florida are generally isolated,
and so just because
there's thunderstorms on the horizon
doesn't mean we can't launch.
I'm more optimistic than pessimistic,
but we're gonna get one last look
at the top of the hour.
Thank you, sir.
- Have a great launch.
- My pleasure. Thank you.
- Hey, this is huge.
- We got more down there.
Gets me through the day.
I'm very grateful.
It's not too bad.
I mean...
...it's a mess, but at least it's...
It has a chance to clear up.
The big thing right now
is isolated thunderstorms.
The question is,
is it gonna be sufficiently problematic
to where we... we can't launch?
Um, right now, I'm being told fifty-fifty.
Hi, it's me, Tim Dodd,
the Everyday Astronaut.
I'm three miles away,
looking at the rocket right now.
The weather is starting to clear up
here a little bit,
but I can tell you,
based on the amount of people,
this is definitely the launch
to watch for the year, guys.
Now, just waiting to hear
what's gonna happen.
My name is Jessie Anderson.
I'm a lead manufacturing engineer
here at SpaceX,
and I speak for all of us
when I say we could not be more excited
to finally be sending humans
to the International Space Station.
It's a great day.
Today's mission is known as
Demonstration Mission-2.
It's gonna be the first time
a commercially built spacecraft
will launch people to the space station.
Demo-2 is an end-to-end flight test,
from launch all the way to docking,
and ending with splashdown.
And it's the final test for NASA
to certify SpaceX
for regular crew flights
to the space station.
I don't get nervous for launches.
I don't get nervous
for doing speaking gigs.
Starting a month ago or so,
I started getting nervous for this launch.
I shouldn't have eaten breakfast.
It's a stress-eating kind of day.
And then yesterday was tough,
and today, just forget it.
Hard to get any work done at all today.
I always worry about the things
that we don't know about.
Launch makes you superstitious.
It's called launch juju. Um, I don't know
where that term came from.
I think it's an Air Force term actually,
but people do very odd things.
So here's my Dragon socks.
Cool launch-day socks is my ritual.
I don't look
at the mission sticker.
I can't look at it before we fly.
I will wear red sometimes
when it's really important.
Don't wear red on launch day.
- Really?
- Red means "no go." Don't wear it.
Wearing green would be extra good luck.
Hans has got it figured out.
I call it the launch beard.
Like, you know, it grows out.
And then day of the launch, it cleans up.
I usually have a beard,
but if we don't launch more than
two days in a row, I shave the beard.
Why is that?
Just so that we can launch
on the third day.
I was in Scotland
for the first time we got to orbit,
so for every launch,
I put stickies in my shoe
that say "Scotland" on it.
So I am always in Scotland when we launch.
Are you a very superstitious person?
I'm not at all, uh, except for this.
I think we've pounded flat
the risks that we understand
and the risks we know about,
and I really hope we do the right thing
by Doug and Bob
and get them to the space station safely
and inspire generations to come.
Really, we just can't fuck it up.
That's the most important thing
about today.
No fucking it up.
This is my second one.
That was my first. So I don't know,
is that like three? I don't know.
Okay, Jim,
we have the, uh, official weather update.
The cell that they're worried about
has moved to the north.
- So we're go for launch.
- Fantastic.
- So we're gonna head over.
- Yes.
Big day, sir.
- It is.
- Yeah, it is.
I think anybody
who's been involved in this
for the last decade
has got to be
on the edge of their seat right now.
This agency has had
many, many tough times in the past...
but for Bob and Doug's launch today,
we've done everything we can.
There comes that moment
when you say, "Okay, now is the time."
Here they come, NASA astronauts
Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.
They've each made this journey
twice before.
There's Megan and Karen
and their sons.
- I love you.
- I love you, Dad.
Here's my big hug. Here comes the big hug.
Oh, squeeze.
When you're saying goodbye
to your family, you really realize
that there's more to it
than just a rocket going up.
That there's... There can be consequences.
To see your parent launch
on the rocket,
it's scary for a small kid.
The first time we shared it with him,
his opinion was, you know,
"Daddy can't go to space."
That's something
I wasn't quite, uh, prepared for.
I didn't expect to... to have that hit me
as much as it did.
And we are following the convoy
as they continue
to make their way to the pad.
These people have been working long hours.
Coronavirus happened, and we made it.
And here they come.
Just minutes from now,
the astronauts will climb into Dragon.
It's a beautiful view up there, too,
of getting ready for the business at hand
of heading to the cosmos.
We're gonna make sure
all your zippers are closed,
minus your gloves.
Good?
Does it feel like
this line is gonna move?
And then this will kind of move off.
This should subside
anything behind it.
- Okay.
- Probably a couple hours.
I think if we can get Elon here.
I just wanna make sure he's in the loop.
I just wanna double-check.
Who's doing the measurement?
The Range.
Yeah, great, but who at the Range?
Uh, the Launch Weather Officer.
Basically, the whole weather office.
They're the ones that basically
make the call on the Range weather.
Mike's gonna call it right now.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Weather is go at this time.
Dragon copy. Go weather.
Dragon, SpaceX.
You are go for section seven.
Close visors and arm launch escape system.
Visors coming closed.
7.2, our visors are closed,
and we're arming the launch escape system.
Launch escape system
is verified armed.
Launch director
to countdown net, poll is complete,
and we have a go
to proceed with propellant load.
Propellant load has started.
Dragon, SpaceX launch director.
2D to violate a couple of weather rules
that now do not expect to clear
in time for launch.
Proceed to 2D
launch abort sequence, please.
We copy.
We can see some raindrops on the windows,
and it's just part of the deal.
Copy all.
That's it.
- It's aborted?
- Yeah.
It's not our day.
Basically,
we've got ten major weather rules,
and three of them
are in violation right now.
- Three?
- Yeah.
At least eyeballing it, this does not look
like we should be stopping launch.
We wanna make sure
we're not scrubbing
based on half-hour-old weather.
The measurement's real-time...
it's real-time lightning.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
We just wanna make sure it's real
and we're not jumping at shadows.
Okay.
So next launch time is Saturday.
Okay.
I... am bummed.
Yes, I am bummed too.
I, too, am bummed. Yes.
I am too.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Thanks for the valiant effort today.
Appreciate your resilience.
Yeah, we appreciate those words.
Everybody did great today,
and we'll do it again on Saturday.
Today,
we're giving it another shot.
Wednesday's first attempt was postponed
due to that wild weather,
but if all goes well today,
we will mark a new first
and usher in the commercial-crew era
of American spaceflight.
To get an actual scrub,
it really was almost like a gift.
It was just one last chance
to go through and evaluate
and make sure everything's ready to fly.
But from an emotional standpoint,
it was extremely difficult.
My son, Jack, was really hit pretty hard
when we scrubbed.
Karen said he kind of went
and sat in a chair
and just wanted to be by himself.
He kind of gets
that there's a lot that can go wrong.
He had already said goodbye to me,
and I... I think he probably didn't wanna
have to go through that again.
Hey, buddy, I love you.
You bet. This is gonna be cool.
Be good for Mommy.
See you, buddy.
Hey, Theo,
you be on good behavior, okay?
And enjoy today.
Watch the rocket for me, okay?
I'll call you from the space station.
Okay, you're welcome.
I love you.
To see your parent launch on a rocket
is something that my son
hasn't been exposed to.
I needed to figure out a way
to prepare him for that.
This is, uh, Tremor.
Tremor is, uh...
was actually my son's dinosaur.
I decided to bring Tremor
and take him through the entire process,
you know, to make it feel
a little bit more normal for my son.
Core and countdown one
in T-minus 2 hours and 46 minutes.
The crew has arrived at the White Room.
Its ingress is in progress on schedule.
Launch Control,
clear to retract the axis arm on time.
Crew access arm retract has started.
Launch director
to countdown net, poll is complete,
and we have a go
to proceed with propellant load.
Copy.
What's up, Elon?
Looking a little nicer today.
It looks really nice.
- Oh, palo santo.
- Yeah.
Like it. Anything you can do.
It's for good luck.
Situations like this,
you can't have too much luck.
You believe in luck?
I believe luck
is the best superpower.
If you can have any superpower,
luck is the one you'd want.
Propellant fills are complete.
Falcon 9 is in startup.
Dragon is in countdown.
FTS is armed for launch.
All right.
Holy shit, here we go.
Here we go.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Go for launch.
SpaceX, Dragon. We're go for launch.
Let's light this candle.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Ignition. Liftoff.
- It's going.
- Here we go.
Stage one propulsion is nominal.
Falcon power telemetry nominal.
We're monitoring.
Vehicle is supersonic
and passing through
maximum dynamic pressure.
Copy one bravo.
And 1D throttle down.
Throttling down the Merlin engines.
Standing by for separation.
Dragon copy.
Stage separation confirmed.
First stage has done its job.
Switch over to the second.
Second stage ignited.
SpaceX, Dragon.
Thanks for the great ride to space.
Congratulations. We just put...
we just put astronauts in orbit.
- Incredible.
- Yeah!
Yeah.
Well-done, guys.
- Good work.
- That's awesome.
Congrats hug.
That's real, dude. That's space!
Wow. It only takes nine minutes
to get to orbit.
Nine minutes, and you're going
25 times the speed of sound.
Bob and Doug...
Bob and Doug are cool as cucumbers.
Just hanging out.
It looks too smooth.
Two dads.
Dads in space.
Well, everyone, kind of a tradition
we've had with spacecraft,
going way back to the Mercury era.
We're given the honor
to name this capsule.
Without further ado,
we would like to, uh, welcome you aboard
Capsule Endeavour.
Uh, I'll tell you
that for the ride uphill,
while it was a... an exciting ride,
I think we got a... a couple of surprises
just in terms of the way the vehicle
is kind of moving
and... and shaking
and taking you into orbit.
You can tell that it's, uh...
It's fighting against the Earth
as it makes its way into space.
We did, it turns out,
end up with one stowaway
on board our, uh, vehicle
when we launched today.
I hope both of our sons
were super excited to see, uh, their toy
floating around with us on board.
I'm sure they would rather be here,
given the opportunity,
but hopefully,
they're proud of this as well.
So with that, I think it'll be
good night from Capsule Endeavour.
Good night, Megan and Theo.
And Karen and Jack.
Thank you. Congratulations.
We can breathe
another sigh of relief.
Indeed.
You're good there?
- He's left of the pole? Yeah?
- I gotcha.
So far, everything has performed
very, very well,
and we are excited
that Bob and Doug are safely in orbit
and on the way
to the International Space Station.
Elon, what would you say
to those who doubted SpaceX could do this?
Do you have a message for them?
Do I have a message for those who...
- What?
- Who doubted you.
Oh, doubted. Okay.
I was like, "What did he...?" Okay. Um...
Maybe I just blank out the word "doubt."
No, I mean, I...
To be totally frank, I doubted us too.
When starting SpaceX,
I thought we maybe had
a 10% chance of reaching orbit.
But fortunately, fate has smiled upon us
and brought us to this day.
Elon, you said
that you had told Bob and Doug's boys
that you'd do everything you can
to bring them home safely.
Even with a safe launch out of the way,
that must still weigh on you,
and I wondered what it's like as a dad.
Um...
So, you know, uh, there's still...
We still gotta dock with Space Station.
We still gotta, uh... still gotta return.
I think there's an argument that
the return is more... more dangerous
in some ways than the ascent.
So we don't wanna declare victory yet.
Anyway... I'm getting choked up here, so...
It... It's... Really, this...
Yeah, I don't...
I'm getting choked up. Sorry.
I'm not sure I can answer the question
any more than that except, um...
Yeah, we're gonna do everything we can
to make sure it gets home safely.
Well, good morning,
everyone, from, uh, Endeavour.
We, uh, had a great night.
Got to get a little sleep.
And, uh, as you can see,
a beautiful day pass right now.
Getting pretty close to ISS,
uh, as we're flying
at about 17,500 miles an hour
around the planet.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Comm check on big loop.
SpaceX, Dragon.
Loud and clear now on the big loop.
Good morning, Anna.
Good morning.
Great to hear your voice.
It's great to hear yours as well.
We're looking forward to rendezvousing
with Space Station today.
I am responsible for being
Bob and Doug's eyes and ears on the ground
as they approach and then dock
with the International Space Station.
My role is to help make sure
that they are informed
of anything that's going awry,
and I am forever grateful
to be a part of this moment.
One of my fourth-grade teachers
was actually the daughter
of one of the astronauts
on the Challenger.
She brought our class to NASA,
and from that time on,
I knew I wanted to be
a part of space operations.
I still am amazed by how
she... she ultimately changed my life,
and I imagine that she changed
many other people's lives
as a result of something
that had to have been
incredibly painful for her.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Your rendezvous complete time
is expected to be 1050 UTC.
Copy.
As Dragon is approaching
the space station,
it's flying at incredible speeds.
It first does a series of burns
to get it in close proximity
to the space station
until the point at which
it is basically in a straight line
towards the docking adapter.
The whole time,
we are watching our telemetry
and making sure that
when it gets to the docking adapter,
it is precisely where it needs to be.
One problem, and it's a collision.
We face that risk, and we deal with that
by being extremely intentional
in everything we do.
Space Station on the big loop.
Dragon, tally ho. I know you guys
probably see it on the video cameras,
but with the naked eye,
we can see it as well.
Looking like a nice, shiny new friend.
Dragon copies. We'll be there in a second.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Ground is go for approach initiation.
Dragon on the big loop. We copy go.
Dragon,
just 400 meters directly below station,
swinging itself up out in front
to align itself with the docking adapter.
Dragon, SpaceX. Commanding hold.
Copy. We will command the hold.
Dragon holding
a little over 17,000 miles an hour,
directly out in front
of the space station.
Space Station on the big loop.
Crew on the International Space Station
is ready for docking.
Dragon, SpaceX.
You are go to execute final approach.
Copy. Go for docking.
We are following along with you.
One hundred meters
away from the space station.
You know, as we were approaching
the space station,
I remember being extremely focused.
I had a checklist in my mind.
We're inside 20 meters.
And I remember at one point,
we were close to docking,
and I looked up, and I saw Dragon.
I just had this moment
of almost pinching myself
that... that I couldn't believe
this was happening.
I told myself this is...
this is an incredibly special moment.
Three meters to go.
Two meters.
We are inside the hands-off point.
One meter to go.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Docking sequence is complete.
Welcome
to the International Space Station.
Dragon arriving.
The crew of Expedition 63
is honored to welcome
Dragon and the commercial crew program
aboard the International Space Station.
Bob and Doug,
glad to have you as part of the crew.
Aboard
the International Space Station,
Commander Chris Cassidy
standing by in node two.
He does have two crew members on board,
both Russian cosmonauts.
He, uh, recently launched
on the same Russian Soyuz spacecraft
just a little more than a month ago.
And with that, Endeavour, welcome
to the International Space Station.
Please come aboard.
Station, this is
the NASA Administrator. Can you hear me?
We hear you loud and clear, sir.
Welcome to the space station.
Thank you, Chris.
It's good to see you.
And welcome to Bob and Doug.
I will tell you,
the whole world saw this mission,
and we are so, so proud.
I have a... a question for Chris.
Our crew here
decided to be about three days late.
You gotta work them overtime,
I presume now,
to get them caught up on all
the activities that they missed out on.
Well, the day they missed out on
was a good one for them to skip.
It was Saturday housecleaning, and I...
But I took care of it for 'em.
We'll catch up next... next weekend.
Uh, but in all seriousness,
we're looking forward to some
operational stuff later in the month.
Maybe we'll get outside
and do some space walks.
So we're... we're all super excited
to have two more crewmates
to the Expedition 63 team.
Station, this is James Corden
with the CBS Late Late Show.
How are you, gentlemen? Can you hear me?
James.
Welcome aboard
the International Space Station.
We heard you loud and clear.
How are you getting on up there?
How are you doing? Are you okay?
We're doing pretty good.
I think we're assimilating
into the, uh, ISS life,
trying to help Chris out
as much as we can.
That's great.
I'm jealous of both of you right now
because I've spent most of my life
wanting to be weightless.
Tell me, what's the best and worst thing
about living life
in zero gravity every day?
Oh, look at this.
That's magnificent.
You can imagine
that there's a lot of places,
like going to the restroom, for example,
where you like stuff
to stay where you put it.
And so, uh, we definitely find that
frustrating at times.
Time to go.
You take the valve, and, uh...
That's where your business goes.
They have six crew quarters
on board the space station,
and those crew quarters
are really, really nice.
You've got your laptop in there.
You've got your sleeping bag
attached to a wall.
Can you reach down
and touch your toes?
You probably would have to fold
your computer up,
and then you might be able
to kind of do a sit-up,
uh, and not hit both walls.
I mean, it's certainly not huge,
but it's actually kind of...
kind of cozy, if... if I had to be honest.
What kind of liquids
can you drink?
Is there a cocktail hour in space?
Every hour is cocktail hour for, uh...
for astronauts.
Because you can drink balls of fluid
right out of the air like that.
I don't know how many of these examples
I wanna set for my son,
because he'll be playing
with his food all day
if he gets the chance
to see something like this.
Chicken.
We exercise
for about two hours, uh, every day,
with weight lifting
and either running or cycling
to maintain our health and our fitness
for our return.
Our heart,
its most important job
is to feed the brain oxygenated blood.
And then when you take
the gravity vector out of the picture,
the heart sends too much up to the brain,
and your head gets all puffed up.
The way your body adapts
to weightlessness,
I distinctly remember
when I first got to space,
every time I would flip upside down,
I felt like I was upside down.
And there was a moment
where I was trying to hang my sleeping bag
on the mid-deck wall,
and, just like this,
my mind completely changed.
And from that point on,
I could be in any orientation,
and I never felt like I was upside down.
It was so neat to me,
the way your body and mind
just switch like that.
You feel congested
because you still have
all this extra volume in your head.
So your sense of smell
and your sense of taste are dull.
We have every hot sauce
known to humankind.
You pour that on absolutely everything.
I believe birthday wishes
are in order, Bob. Is that true?
That's true.
I got to join the 50-year-old club,
just like these two other guys.
They've been teasing me all day about it.
Yeah, I know it's not safe
to put 50 candles on a cake
in a high-oxygen environment,
but at least make everybody sing to you.
Because I know so well what Bob
is doing, I know he's working really hard.
I've had those same experiences,
and I know it's hard
to be away from your family.
It was important to us
to do something special.
That encouragement from home,
I think, is really important,
that we're thinking of him,
that we know what he's doing is hard.
You know, the work requires,
you know, a lot of dedication,
a lot of focus, a lot of problem-solving,
and always a lot of risk.
Can you guys hear me?
- Yeah, loud and clear.
- Okay.
Check the PTT's off.
Houston air lock on one.
Uh, we're complete
with the, uh, med-ox lab
change-out procedure.
Going back to step 15 in 1.225.
Thanks, Doug,
for working the setup so well.
Got us right on timeline.
We appreciate it.
Chris and Bob, good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Okay, with that,
we'll step into the post depress.
- EV1 copies.
- EV2 copies.
To keep Space Station
flying over the Earth,
it's a constant maintenance program.
We do all these space walks
to either add modules to the space station
when we were building it.
And now it's to replace
pieces of equipment
that either are getting old or that fail.
Our mission is essentially
to upgrade the batteries.
You know, the power of the space station
is maintained by the battery system.
Through the solar arrays,
the batteries are recharged.
And so just like
a rechargeable battery at home,
after many years of these cycles,
and then of course the hot and cold
of being in space
between daylight and darkness,
those batteries wear out.
It's a big job, because these batteries
are like 400 pounds apiece.
Fortunately, we got both Bob and Chris,
two of our best spacewalkers.
- Doing good?
- Yeah.
During my first two missions,
I did six space walks
associated with the construction
of the space station.
But even though I've done it
a couple of times,
it doesn't get easy for me.
You know, there's a lot of pressure
in a situation like that,
that, uh, if you don't do
your job, uh, successfully,
I could float off into space.
You have to compartmentalize
and take deep breaths
so that you can pace yourself
and stay focused
in the face of this daunting task.
Hey, Bob, we're ready
with the crew lock depress.
We're gonna take the, uh, depress
pump power switch to "on."
Okay. Depress pump power coming on.
Good luck, guys.
Okay, guys, great job.
We're gonna pick up slowly.
Yeah.
Bob, for you, as you get outboard,
you're looking for handrail 2075
for your green hook.
Copy. 2075.
- It's kind of dark out here, Chris.
- Yeah, it's kind of dark.
How much longer
till daylight has me?
Approximately
three and a half minutes till daylight.
- Sun.
- Here comes the sun again.
You should be coming up
on the coast of California soon.
If you look south,
you might see Hawthorne.
And, Bob, did you wanna go
to battery one first?
Let's go to battery three first.
You'll be going to H1.
Confirm socket tape line flush.
Looking for eight turns
to release the battery.
I have control of the batteries?
You have control.
Okay, copy that.
Looks good, guys.
And we're about
to enter a night pass.
Bob, I have several cautions and warnings
for you when you're ready.
I'm ready.
Okay, no sudden movements.
The Bravo 7 torque setting
may cause bolt failure.
This could result in a non-captive
sharp edge and broken shank.
How copy?
Copy all.
Is there any good news about this?
Sounds scary, Bob.
You sure you wanna do that?
- Obviously.
- Obviously.
It looks equal to me on both sides.
I agree.
In the indicator, those locked.
Copy, such a good install.
Just a heads-up, you're going
into a day pass in about a minute.
How about a picture?
It's a good location, good time.
Yeah.
I don't know if we're gonna make it
through another day-night cycle.
Yeah, that's good.
To see the wondrous events
that are happening
as you go through a space walk,
there's sunrises and sunsets,
you realize, you know,
our world is precious,
and you start having appreciation
for how little you actually are.
And I think every astronaut
kind of feels the same way.
As you go around the Earth,
you don't see the lines and the borders
that are drawn on maps.
You see the Earth as this one entity,
and it's our home.
You sense its fragility
in this sort of vast blackness of space
and this very thin atmosphere
that's what's keeping us all safe.
You feel very protective, I think,
and you feel a very strong connection.
Even the most hardened,
cynical astronauts, you know,
once they've gone to space,
it's changed them and for the better.
You know, you look down, and you go,
"We're all on this little ball."
And then you look back into space
and get this overwhelming sense
of, you know,
the things we're gonna do next.
Okay, Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.
Oh gee, that's great.
Yes, indeed.
They've got the flag up now,
and you can see the stars and stripes.
Beautiful, just beautiful.
Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the Moon.
July 1969 AD.
They came in peace for all mankind.
And welcome home.
Landing on the Moon
is singularly the most dramatic event
in the history of humanity.
And so this is the leftovers,
basically.
If you asked what inspired me,
this is what inspired me.
- Saturn V?
- Yeah.
I mean, that's what I saw
when I was a kid.
This is pretty crazy.
You know how much thrust it had?
A million and something?
Like the size
of that gas generator,
it almost looks like
the size of our thrust chamber.
Exactly.
Yeah, it's huge.
This is the most powerful rocket
that had been built up to date.
Yeah,
you just need that energy to get...
To the Moon.
- Or to Mars.
- Mars, so...
The other thing to recognize
is, like, this was all like new stuff
that they had made and, like,
didn't have much flight experience on.
I mean, we have, like,
80-something flights.
And we're slowly
getting into those flights.
Only now are we confident enough
to put Bob and Doug in there.
And they tested it twice and said,
"Okay, you guys go in there."
Yeah.
All right, let's go one step further.
- That's the lunar lander.
- Yeah.
It looks small, actually.
- I wanna see that inside.
- Yeah.
They'd be standing up in there, basically.
There's no... no chair or anything.
Yeah, and this had the rudiments
of digital computers in there.
I mean, a computer on this thing,
I don't think there's anything
comparable that we have.
- A car key is probably smarter.
- Yeah.
But, I mean, they made it work.
- I mean, that's the main thing.
- That's the fascinating thing.
Even more dramatic
when you think that what they had
in terms of electronics to make that work.
Yeah.
Pretty inspiring coming back here
and just looking at it.
Now that we've shown
that we can fly astronauts...
...it's time to go back to the Moon
with astronauts again for a longer time
and extend our range to Mars.
These super smart,
super talented people,
they believe in the goal.
A base on the Moon
and a city on Mars can happen.
I was not sure
whether such a path existed before.
Now I am confident
that such a path exists.
But first, we got
a real important mission tomorrow.
Good morning, Bob and Doug.
We have a special message for you
to start your day.
Rise and shine, Daddy. We love you.
We can't wait to see you.
Wake up, wake up!
I'm happy you went into space,
but I'm even happier
that you're coming back home.
Hurry home so we can go get my dog.
We love you, Dad.
We're about to embark
on the final portion of the journey.
And as I look forward
to heading back home,
my son and Doug's son are really excited
not only to get their fathers back
but to get our Apatosaurus,
our zero-G indicator,
that they nominated to go with us.
And so for Jack and Theo,
uh, Tremor the Apatosaurus
is, uh, headed home soon.
Reentry is obviously
the next big milestone,
and so everything
has to work really, really well.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
SpaceX, Dragon. Comm checks.
Dragon to ground.
It's hard to prepare yourself.
You don't know exactly
what you're gonna feel.
But there's a part of you
that can't let go
of that sort of, you know,
hopefully irrational fear
that something could go wrong.
The final reconfigurations
for undock
are complete and nominal.
Am I gonna be nervous? Absolutely.
But I want my son to experience
the joy and excitement of that moment
and try to keep
all of the... the nervousness to myself.
The ground is go for undocking.
Please confirm your visors are down
and that you are ready
for undock and departure.
Our visors are down,
and we're ready for departure.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Separation confirmed.
Endeavour, Station. Bob and Doug,
it's been an honor to serve with you.
Safe travels
and have a successful landing.
Godspeed.
Endeavour copies all. Thanks, Chris.
Bob and I,
we're just excited to get back home.
But you can never let your guard down,
especially on a first flight.
You know, you really have to do
the whole mission end to end.
There was a time when we thought,
"Well, we just get through the ascent,
and we'll be fine."
But then we had Columbia.
Everything look good to you?
Control and rates
and everything is nominal, right?
Control has been stable.
We have good trims.
- I don't see anything out of the ordinary.
- Okay.
This is amazing. It's really
getting fairly bright out there.
Yeah, you definitely
don't want to be outside now.
Both Bob and I were on the runway
where the shuttle would be landing.
I remember them knocking on the window
and saying to us
that they'd lost, uh, comm,
uh, and data and tracking from Columbia.
Columbia, Houston, comm check.
Columbia, Houston, UHF comm check.
We do not have
any valid data at this time.
Oh my God.
We've got some breaking news.
There you see what appears to be
multiple pieces of the shuttle.
We can only hope
that what we're seeing is not the worst.
When landing time came
and the shuttle didn't come,
we were there in the room
when they told the families
what they think had happened
and that it was likely not survivable
and that they were, you know,
gonna do the best they could,
but when the vehicle
broke up at 200, 250,000 feet,
that it's not likely
that anybody survived.
Just seeing the pieces of Columbia,
pieces of the crew module
and helmets and those kinds of things,
you know, that... that leaves an impression
that I think you never ever...
you never really get over.
When you lose a rocket
with a payload on it,
that is a bad situation.
But if you lose a rocket
with a crew on it,
that... that is
an order of magnitude different.
And in the end, you don't want anybody
to ever have to go through that again.
We have been preparing
for Bob and Doug to come home.
You know,
as soon as that capsule released,
uh, and we undocked,
the nerves popped up again,
the general feeling of like,
"Oh man, we're in free flight."
And these boys are coming home.
It's happening.
Um, there's no turning back at this point.
So... it's time to rock and roll,
talk to the recovery dudes,
and... and get Bob and Doug home.
Everything's been going
very smoothly for Bob and Doug
ever since they undocked
from the space station yesterday.
Now just ready and waiting
to begin the reentry process.
Yeah, really exciting day
as we approach splashdown here
in a matter of a few hours...
I've gotta talk to these two guys.
...to think that this all started
two months ago, and here we are.
- Did you get some sleep?
- Yeah. A few hours.
- A few hours?
- Yeah.
- How's everything looking?
- Ready to go.
Yeah, everything's looking great.
Dragon's in good shape.
All right, good luck.
- Good luck.
- All right, good luck.
Oh, look at that.
They seem super calm.
I guess it doesn't go over well
when they're nervous.
Actually, you can see they're nervous.
They do this...
You know, every once in a while.
I think reentry is the part
that everybody hates.
You're in a stable orbit around the Earth,
and then you do a reentry burn.
That's a thrust maneuver
that reduces your velocity
so that you start descending
until you hit dense atmosphere
and you can't get
a radio signal out anymore.
It's called "blackout."
For a few minutes,
you're in the dark on the ground,
and you have no idea what happens.
Okay, blackout here is 18:36,
and you land at 48.
So that's 12 minutes before we land,
is the blackout.
What altitude is that?
- A hundred and five?
- So...
A hundred
and ninety-five kilometers?
- Does that sound too high?
- Uh, it does sound a little bit high.
- Found it?
- Yeah.
Forty-seven.
- Okay, fifty.
- Fifty. Okay.
So it happens
between 50 and 30 kilometers.
That means you fall from 30 kilometers
to six kilometers in two minutes?
- That's crazy.
- That seems crazy fast, man.
- Yeah.
- Remarkable.
You're moving at high speed,
and you're using the atmosphere to brake.
It's a lot of energy.
It gets hot on the outside,
and on the inside,
you see the fire flying by the window.
You need a heat shield that is perfect.
And after you get through the atmosphere,
you still have to deploy the parachutes.
They come out, then two minutes later,
you deploy the chutes. It's pretty quick.
In my mind,
it's probably the parachutes
that are the most significant thing
that needs to work.
In spite of all the testing we've done,
that's still one of the riskiest parts.
Right.
And, you know, we haven't had
a splashdown since the Apollo program.
Yeah.
Dragon, SpaceX for entry brief.
Go ahead.
The recovery team is go,
and the weather is great,
and your vehicle
is still looking really good for entry.
No health issues at this time.
Copy.
How long until
they hit the atmosphere?
They go into the sequence
in five minutes.
I'm actually here for the deorbit burn.
To make sure that goes well.
- Deorbit burn's coming up now?
- Yeah.
Ah.
Well...
Everything's looking good, I think.
Yeah, well, it certainly has been
quite a journey.
Crazy. Here we are, right?
Yes, 18 years.
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah, I am.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Deorbit burn start.
We copy. Go.
Cool as a cucumber,
because they're not breathing very heavy,
'cause their CO2's not going up.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Deorbit burn complete.
Performance nominal.
Nose cone closure initiated.
All right, boys.
Brace for entry.
Copy.
All right.
Here we go.
Four G's. That's moving.
Almost like a little comet.
Dragon, SpaceX. We show
two minutes until predicted comm blackout.
We will see you
on the other side at 18:42.
Dragon copy, 18:42.
Okay, we're in blackout.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Jesus, dude. This thing is so long.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Come on, where is it?
Let's find that puppy.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, there it is.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Copy, I heard you loud and clear.
We're about 3.9 G's.
Copy, we've got you.
- All right.
- Hell yeah.
Coming in hot.
Passing 15 kilometers,
brace for drogue window.
Copy, we're braced.
Come on, baby.
Visual, two drogues out.
Oh yeah, we felt it.
Slow down, baby.
Drogue descent rate nominal.
Nice.
Yep.
All right.
Let's get these mains out.
Inflate, baby.
Inflate.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
We are visual
on four chutes out.
- Ooh.
- Yeah.
Hold on. Almost down to the ground.
Main chute decent rate nominal.
Passing through 700 meters.
And we're back
to seven meters per second. Nothing.
It's, like, sitting there.
Boom.
Slowing.
Six hundred meters.
Six hundred meters.
Two hundred meters.
We are braced for splashdown.
Copy. Brace for splashdown.
All right! Whoo!
Welcome back to planet Earth,
and thanks for flying SpaceX.
Hell yeah!
Yeah!
All right.
Everything's good?
Everything was great.
This was super smooth.
Okay.
Are there small boats out there?
That doesn't look like a 45-footer to me.
That looks like a...
Now there's a... Who the hell is this?
- It's a boat there. Not ours.
- Oh, it's someone else?
Not ours.
Yeah, these are not our boats.
- Who is that? Just random people?
- Just random people.
- They're just like...
- Oh my gosh.
Look at this, dude,
just like fucking 30 jabroni boats
just show up out of nowhere.
You got a front-row seat.
Dragon, SpaceX. Stand by
for side hatch opening and egress.
Copy. We're ready.
What's up, fellas?
All right,
so they're getting set up.
They're gonna work to get Bob Behnken,
the joint operations commander
for this mission, out of the capsule now.
We got a thumbs-up,
indicating that things are going well.
And now
spacecraft commander Doug Hurley
making his way out of the capsule.
There we go. Another thumbs-up.
Whoo!
- Don.
- Thank you.
Will you have some?
Yeah! Whoo!
Here's to happiness
and to Bob and Doug safely home.
No doubt.
Whoo!
It had been a couple of months
since we had launched,
so I was just really excited
to see my family.
But first, we were going to do
a little bit of a press event.
Six-year-olds, you know, they didn't have
him in handcuffs or anything,
so he broke free
and ran to me at the airplane.
It was just awesome to see him.
I'm glad I didn't fall down the steps
when he tried to tackle me
at the base of the stairs.
All right, um,
we're not gonna stand right now.
For those of you
who have done this before,
you know it's not pleasant standing
for a few hours after you get back.
Five hours ago, we were
in a spaceship bobbing around,
making prank satellite phone calls
to whoever we could get ahold of.
You know, this has been a, uh...
quite an odyssey the last five years
since Bob and I
started working on this program.
And to be where we are now,
the first crewed flight of Dragon,
is just unbelievable.
There's something special
about having that capability
to launch and... and bring
your own astronauts home.
I just wanna thank you all
for coming out today
and celebrating what was accomplished.
Thank you, all.
Whoo-hoo! Yeah.
After these great words that were spoken,
um, I... I'm not sure I have much to add.
I mean, I really came here
'cause I just wanted to see Bob and Doug,
to be totally frank.
Like, my entire adrenaline,
it was just dumped, you know.
It's like...
Like, "Thank God."
You know?
You know, I think
this is an achievement of humanity,
and... and I think the whole world
can look at this as a new era.
We're gonna have a base on the Moon,
and we're gonna have... send people to Mars.
Have... and make life multi-planetary.
And I think this... this day
heralds a new age of space exploration.
You're looking
at the Crew Dragon spacecraft
and Falcon 9 rocket
set to launch four astronauts
to the International Space Station
on a six-month science mission.
This crew is about to fly
in the exact same capsule
that first flew NASA astronauts
Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley
in last year's Demo-2 test flight.
This is the second crew to fly
on a commercial spacecraft
for this new era of human spaceflight.
And here they come,
the Crew-2 astronauts
taking their first steps outside
before their journey to space.
Yay!
Hey, Mommy!
Pilot Megan McArthur
in the front.
Hi, buddy!
Hey, Mommy, I love you.
Looks like Bob Behnken
is there with their son.
They are a power couple,
and I love it.
Now it's time for Megan's mission.
It's super exciting for us
that she's gonna be able
to ride the same Dragon capsule.
And so I need to step in
in the backup role
and flip-flop and make sure
our son Theo gets everything he needs.
See you in six months.
See you in six months. I'm gonna miss you.
My husband flew
the Crew Dragon last year
and happened to be
in the same seat that I'll be in.
This time it's Mom's turn,
and I'm gonna be up there for six months.
As our son gets older,
he's starting to build an awareness
of what it is that we do.
We want him to understand
we think it's important to explore
and to push the boundaries
of what we're capable of.
The crew now on their way
to Launch Complex 39A,
ready for their ride to the space station.
I embrace this dawn of this age
of commercialization of space.
Our mission proved that we could get
humans in the low Earth orbit
and kind of planted the seed
for how we're gonna go beyond that.
As we go forward,
we wanna accomplish all those missions
that help us understand what's out there,
but at the same time,
we have to figure out the smart way
to take care of the resources
and our solar system
and not trash Mars
when the opportunity presents itself.
Of course,
there will be questions and challenges,
like how we're gonna govern
something like that.
But if we can continue
to get people into space,
I can't imagine it doesn't make us better.
Elon, are you go?
Absolutely.
MJ, we're here.
We just spoke to Elon. He's ready to go.
We should think more about,
what's the future we want?
What has the happy ending?
For me, it's, you know, making sure
we become a spacefaring civilization.
Dragon, SpaceX.
You are go for launch.
But it's very important
to appreciate this is not inevitable.
People are mistaken when they think that
technology just automatically improves.
It does not automatically improve.
If you look at great civilizations
like ancient Egypt,
and they were able to make the pyramids,
and they forgot how to do that.
And the Romans,
they built these incredible aqueducts.
They forgot how to do it.
In 1969, we were able
to send somebody to the Moon,
and we forgot how to do that.
T-minus 15 seconds.
The window of opportunity
is open right now
to make life multi-planetary.
But we cannot count on it
being open for a long time.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
We need to take advantage
of that window while it is open.
...four, three, two, one.
Endeavour launches once again.
Four astronauts
from three countries on Crew-2
now making their way to the one and only
International Space Station.
Crew Dragon flying free.
