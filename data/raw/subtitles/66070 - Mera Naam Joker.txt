You might've forgotten me;
but I've never forgotten you
On Monday, I'm presenting
the last show of my life
You must come.
Bring David, too
Do tell him that even today
I say with pride...
My name is Joker
Do you still remember
a little Hindustani?
You saw my very first
performance.
Won't you see my last?
I'm sending the ticket
You were mine once
I'm presenting the last show
of my life. Can you come to it?
I've called Mr. Kumar, too.
You must come
In the history of the circus,
tonight will be memorable.
Because after many long years,
once again before you...
is your favourite laughing,
singing clown, Raju!
Are you a heart or a man?
A man is all heart. A man has
a heart. A heart has a man
You are ailing.
You will be operated upon.
- Doctor, what is wrong with me?
- You have a terrible illness.
Your heart is big,
the world is small.
Then operate on the world.
Why remove this poor soul's heart?
Because no one in the world
has as big a heart as yours.
Such a big heart?
It's even bigger!
It's grown even bigger.
Has someone seen my heart?
Here it is.
Doctor Saab,
my heart's that big?
It's very dangerous to have
a large heart. Look after it well.
If it continues to grow,
it will engulf the world!
The whole world? Doctor,
my heart will engulf the world?
Mr. Mahendra, you must stop him.
If he jumps about like that,
he'll die.
Will you risk a man's life
for a show?
Sher Singh, Raju is not a man.
He is a clown, an entertainer.
He'll live here. He'll die here.
He'll die here.
He'll live here, too
Wonder which subject the new
teacher will teach us today?
- It'll be the same algebra and
geometry. - All that is fine...
but wonder how she looks?
- She looks like this!
Old and snooty!
She'll say, Go on children...
stand on your heads
- Do I look like this?
- No, Madam.
Will you all please sit down?
What is it?
The fatso keeps tripping up.
Children, today we have met
one another in laughter.
May you always be happy.
It's easy to laugh at others.
But you must learn
to laugh at yourself.
The drill, Raju? What is it?
Madam... it's very difficult.
No, it isn't.
Watch me!
Madam, I've split my pants.
Come along.
The seams have opened.
Who made this?
My mother.
So your mother knows
how to sew?
She stitches my uniform.
She can't pay a tailor. We're poor.
Don't say that again!
You have such a big heart
and high ideals.
Who could call you poor?
- What is your mother's name?
- Only mother.
Your father works?
He died.
- Before he died what did he do?
- I was very young.
I've asked mother often.
But she won't tell me.
- She won't?
- No.
She won't tell you?
Try this on.
- I've made a shirt for you.
- I don't want it.
Why? What is it?
What did father do?
Have a wash. Freshen up
and eat something.
No... What did he do?
You said father's with God.
Tell me.
Your father!
Father was a clown, too?
He made people laugh?
Yes, he did. People said he was
the greatest clown in the world.
People went crazy with
laughter each day.
The circus was his life.
He always used to sing...
Here I shall live,
here I shall die
The circus was his life.
The circus caused his death.
When he fell from the trapeze,
people thought it to be...
...the joker's newest act.
He was breathing his last.
And the audience applauded.
Mother, I'll be a joker, too.
I'll make them laugh.
What did you say?
You'll become a clown, too?
Your father made the others
laugh and left me with tears.
Now you? Will you be one, too?
I've slogged day and night
to send you to a good school.
Not to have you be
a clown like your father.
So that some day,
while they laugh, you...
I want you to study
and become a great man.
To be famous and
well-respected.
To live in comfort.
You're here?
I thought as you were praying
that I'd do the same.
Whenever and wherever I've seen
Christ, He always looks so sad.
I've never seen Him smiling.
Why is that?
I'll tell you.
He is unhappy because...
His children, the people
of the world are sad.
Does my sadness
make Him feel sad?
Of course. Because He loves you.
I won't be sad.
I'll make Him laugh.
We're off to a holiday camp.
Take the musical instruments along.
Now boys, tell me
which instruments you play.
Was that you?
Come here.
- Play it again.
- But I...
Play that tune again.
He won't take a dip...
drag him into it!
No...
Catch him and dip him.
Listen, please! I'm cold.
I'll catch pneumonia.
Help! Help me!
What is going on?
What is it?
Someone's drowning?
He isn't drowning.
We want him in.
Don't force someone
who can't swim to dive in.
But you...
Learn some manners. You're
educated. You're not urchins.
Come on. Change your clothes.
Come out now.
Get dressed!
I've committed a sin,
a terrible sin.
They say if you confess,
your sins are washed away.
I promise, I swear,
I won't ever do it again.
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you home?
I was confessing to Sir.
I have sinned.
- Sinned?
- Yes.
Children don't sin.
I'm not a child
Your exams are over. In a few
days, your holidays begin.
I know how much
children love holidays.
If they could, they'd
make Sundays of Monday.
Enjoy the holidays, but
don't forget your studies.
Take out your books
and note down the homework.
You're not going away, either?
Raju, you're here?
Our compartment?
- Why are you here?
- I came to see you off.
What are you hiding?
What is this?
A joker, a clown. It's me.
Keep it safely.
He's very sweet.
He's just like you.
This for me, too?
How were the holidays?
They were too long.
They wouldn't end.
The holidays were too long?
The others said the contrary.
I don't know. They were no fun.
Why not?
You weren't around.
The school was so lonely.
David, meet Raju.
He's the smartest in my class.
Raju, this is David.
My name is Joker.
Raju it's you! Come!
Mary, your student is here.
You've come in such
a downpour?
I'm delivering the books.
From the library.
Madam, I'll go now.
You're drenched.
Have some tea.
I'm in a hurry.
Mother's waiting.
He's a lovable child. He came
all this way in the pouring rain.
Is the class over?
- Yes sir.
- Are you waiting for someone?
- No.
Nothing!
I'm a little late.
You still haven't gone home?
Well, I was...
Poor Raju.
He's nothing of the sort.
He's very mischievous.
He pesters me no end.
He's the pet of the school...
...and the staff.
He may be the pet of the staff.
But for him, only Madam exists.
That's right. He loves you.
He's my student.
It's not the love of the student.
It's the love of a 16-year old.
16-year old?
How can you tell?
I've observed him.
He looks at you with love.
But this love is very
painful for him to live with.
Turning sixteen is the most
delicate phase in one's life.
It's like the day
rushing to meet the dusk...
...which rushes
to meet the night.
And the night
rushes to the day.
The turn where the day meets
the night is called dawn.
It's part night and part day.
Turning 16 is much the same.
It's being part-child,
part-adult.
That's Raju's state.
He's neither a child
nor is he an adult.
He is only... sixteen.
On a sixteen year old
blank page, he has your name.
- Why?
- It's natural.
A climbing plant clings
to whatever supports it.
And so a sixteen-year-old
belongs to the one he loves.
You can't.
Who can stop a flowing stream?
If it can be stopped, it isn't
a stream, nor is it life.
It isn't being 16.
- How do you know all this?
- Because I was sixteen once.
- And now?
- I'm still only sixteen.
- And I love a 20 year-old teacher.
- Lies!
- Honestly!
- It's a lie.
How do we decide
if it's true or not?
Decide?
- How is it?
- Very nice.
I mean the ice-cream
you've not touched.
- I thought...
- That I meant Mary?
Eat it or it'll melt.
I love ice-cream.
- I know.
- Who told you?
She also told me you won't be
a barrister or doctor some day.
But you'll be a clown,
to make the world laugh.
Why don't you laugh at me, too?
Shout like the others: Joker!
Don't be angry.
Come with me.
A man is born on earth
for a short time.
But he is overcome
with sorrow.
Only a clown is happy,
no matter what happens.
- Do you know why?
- Why?
Because whatever a joker does,
he does it for others.
He may cry but
he makes others laugh.
He jumps from the heights
so that people may applaud him.
He paints his face and
wears strange garbs.
He becomes a spectacle.
And while the show is on, he
forgets all his own sorrows.
Who is the greatest
joker of all?
- Who is?
- I mean till now.
God?
He, too, does everything for
others, nothing for Himself.
If I call you a joker,
will you mind?
No sir.
From now, my name is Joker.
Ram Ram to Hindus, Salaams to
Muslims, Good Morning to Christians.
Sat Sri Akal to Sikhs!
Try my wonderful poison...
no powder!
Try it out! Use my black
kohl for your eyes.
It's the best for one and all!
Only one rupee a bottle!
Good people, try one. Buy one.
Try it! Be generous...
What is it? Why stop here?
Someone is selling medicine.
- That's Raju. My friend.
- Raju?
A class-mate
Hello, Bunny. I'm selling.
I may be late for school
Does this boy study
in your school?
He's a great fun.
We call him Joker.
He's poor, so he has
to make do somehow.
We'll have to see to him.
- You haven't paid your fees.
- Father, I said I'd pay.
My mother is ill. That's why
I'm late. We'll pay up soon.
That's why you go about
dressed as a clown?
I like being a clown.
My father was one, too.
You'll have to leave.
You can't stay.
Father, Raju is a very
intelligent boy.
It isn't a crime to be a joker?
Many children in the West
study and work, too.
I must think of
the other parents.
I've been expelled. I wanted
to make You laugh...
...may be that's why.
I'm going.
I'm leaving, too.
You're leaving?
Because of me?
No, there's another reason.
I'm getting married
in a few days.
Getting married? To David?
Yes, in this church.
You will come, won't you?
He wants you as best man.
- Didn't you understand?
- No.
The dearest friend
has to be best man.
You are our dearest friend,
aren't you?
You'll come?
Of course, I will.
How can I refuse?
I will come, Madam.
You're the best man.
It's your right.
- Here.
- What is it?
A present.
I should've...
I have your gift.
My gift?
I have taken your teacher
away from you.
But this...
What must I do?
Keep it safe.
I'm returning it to you.
It's you, for you.
For me?
One day, Raju will become
an adult.
Raju, the clown
will stay the same.
Innocent and pure.
Think carefully before
you give this to anyone.
If anyone does anything
for a clown, it's a jest.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Don't worry!
You speak Hindustani?!
Wait there, you rascal!
You tricked me and got
in here? Out!
He fooled me!
Take Miss Marina
to the make-up tent.
It's nothing. This man has
made a mistake.
Khan, is this a way
to treat guests?
I've been tricked.
I was looking for a rascal...
...who came in with him.
Can't you make out between
An Indian and a Russian?
Sir, there isn't much difference.
These people are our guests.
Don't blunder again.
I apologise!
Apologise to them.
I'm sorry.
Please don't take any offence.
Please forgive me.
Your dog is a real torpedo.
He shot everywhere.
He made me enter places,
I shouldn't.
Be thankful I escaped alive.
Mr. Mahendra, I've worked
for you for seven years.
I won't tolerate another
ring-master in my place.
Why can't you see?
The Russian ring-master is
a guest. Give him a chance.
Where is he? None of these
artists look like ring-masters.
He's arriving on
the next flight.
I tell you, he'll be
scared to come.
If he doesn't,
then you'll be on.
And if he does?
Sir, are you the Russian
ring-master?
It's your blue eyes.
I can tell you're Russian.
Yes! I'm the ring-master.
You are Hindustani?
Where did you learn it?
University, Moscow.
Explain clearly.
Professor Koski at the
University said...
Rajovsky, you speak
Hindustani like an Indian
- Here.
- A love-letter?
Better than that! It's money.
Mr. Mahendra said you will be
performing with the lions.
The lions?
Sher Singh, come here!
He's the Russian ring-master...
Mister...
And this is our ring-master...
Sher Singh
He speaks our language
very well.
I do and sometimes I don't.
Even if you do, can you understand
the language my lions talk?
I'll understand.
Get the lions ready!
My foot!
Tonight will be a special date
in the history of the circus.
Tonight the Ganges
and the Volga meet.
Indian and Russian artists
together...
will perform and
entertain you.
This is our aim. If the world
wants peace, this must be its aim.
I present Soviet Union's
incomparable trapeze artist...
...Miss Marina!
Excuse me, sir, please listen...
He speaks our language!
Don't tell anyone.
I'm not Russian, I'm Indian.
- Will you do me a favour?
- Yes?
There's 200 in this
and my mother's address.
If anything happens to me,
please deliver it.
I'll be grateful.
And now we present, Soviet
Union's renowned ring master...
...Ivan Rajovsky!
That man isn't from our circus.
He isn't even a Russian.
Yes, him! He isn't even
a lion-trainer.
Sher Singh, hurry!
You speak Hindi.
But you look Russian.
You are light-skinned.
Blue eyes and brown hair.
You wear western clothes.
Who are you?
Isn't it enough for you that...
I'm a human-being, who has two eyes,
two ears, a nose, a stomach and...
...a heart?
If you want, call me Raju,
or Rajovsky.
Why did you tell such
an enormous lie?
Should I say it in front of all?
Yes, go on and tell us.
They're all friends
So listen...
I told a big lie because
we're past the age of small lies.
It's the age of big lies.
Women who apply paint and
powder are considered beautiful.
People who lie to the public
are called leaders.
In business, the bigger the
lie you tell, the richer you are.
In this field of big lies,
I'm but a small player.
Fool! Don't you realize
you risked your life?
The lions would've devoured you.
Yes, I was scared.
But in this world,
there's something more scary.
Poverty and hunger.
I had to get money somehow
to feed my mother and myself.
For my mother's treatment.
I've wandered from city to city.
My mother has been ill.
I didn't have money
to pay the doctor.
No one gave me a job.
They'd say: You call
entertaining others, work?
Join a circus
The truth is, even the doors of
a circus were closed for me.
To enter I had to tell a big lie.
Tell me...
How do we punish him?
What does the jury says?
You've been found
guilty of being humane.
Our court has decided that
you shall be kept prisoner...
in this circus until you wish
to leave of your free will.
She says you're a strange man.
Me? Strange?
Thank you!
She wants to know why
you're thanking her?
Because at least she
considers me a man.
She says, when you were
in the lion's cage...
...she was very concerned
for your life.
Sorry, I must go.
You were concerned
for my life.
You were...
...concerned for...
...for my life?
Da means yes?
What do you say for no?
- Listen! - Tell me,
what is the problem?
The problem is that
what does desvidanya mean?
It means, we'll meet again.
What is the matter?
You look very happy.
Did you find a job?
What does da' mean?
Da' means yes'. From now on,
everything in life is da'!
Then bring me a bride.
- A bride?
- Yes. Now say da'
If God wills it, yes!
Come here!
Were you just singing?
- Were you singing?
- I won't do it again.
Yes, you will!
And every night, too
From now, you'll be a clown who
sings and entertains.
In your circus?
Thank you, sir.
No Sir. Call me Mahendra.
- You called me sir again!
- Sir...
For you...
I'll sing. I'll make them laugh.
I will sing a song
for the audience. A song!
Namaste.
How are you?
I'm fine.
No, remember the gender.
How are you, Miss?
I'm fine, Miss.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
You must sit down too.
For you...
It's for you. Try it on.
For you... try it on.
Not like that.
Tie it round your waist.
How do I look?
Remember the gender!
Main kaisi hoon, not kaisa
You look lovely.
Ma will be happy.
My mother.
I haven't a mother, only father.
You don't have a mother?
Well, I don't have a father.
Only mother.
Will you meet her?
My mother will meet
the fairy of her dreams.
- Mother, look who's here.
- Who is it?
The fairy you dreamt of.
May you be blessed with
a long life, child.
May you be showered
with prosperity.
Marina doesn't speak our language.
She isn't an Indian.
- Is she a Bengali?
- No, mother.
She's very fair-skinned.
She must be Kashmiri.
She's belongs to a place
close to there.
Mother, rest.
We must return to the shop.
She works there, too.
Whoever she is, I approve. But
you must stop her from working.
Shameless fellow!
Letting your wife-to-be work.
Don't worry, mother.
I thought of that, too
Okay mother, we will go now.
Mother said when a guest...
...visits our home, they
never leave empty-handed
One moment.
Here you are.
What is this?
It's me.
Keep it with you.
- What is this?
- It's me.
Can I come in?
For you.
Sir, you called?
I told you not to call me Sir'
But Mahendra.
You tell the others...
Watch where you're going
You yourself don't watch
where you're going.
- I don't get it.
- Sit down.
Listen, Raju you're a joker.
You make others laugh
at your own expense.
But for your own happiness
you can't make others sad.
Whom do you mean?
Marina.
The Russian artists are guests.
They're leaving soon.
They're good people.
They are our friends. But they
belong to a foreign land.
Their language, culture differ.
Maybe you don't know, every
country is separated by a wall.
To come here they need
passports, to go there...
...we need passports.
I know all that.
I was trying to forget.
My naive mother dreamt of
a fairy-like daughter-in-law.
She knows no walls.
Trust in me.
I won't forget now.
Your mother is very ill.
She wants to see you
and her daughter-in-law.
Daughter-in-law?
What have you done?
For the first time ever,
you've found a mother
And you will hurt her?
She loves you.
You'll reject her?
What shall I do?
What am I to do?
Come in. Come, daughter.
My daughter.
How are you?
I was telling Raju
only today...
...to bring my fairy.
I'd see her and I'd be fine.
Raju is a very good man.
His heart is...
You're crying?
My heart is crying!
My child...
Your son is a wonder. He makes
everyone roar with laughter.
So he does, does he?
That's what I feared.
Please sit in the front.
The circus was life for him.
The circus meant death for him
When he fell from the trapeze.
The audience thought...
here's the clown's latest act
He was breathing his last breath
and they applauded
Mother!
Now you know the truth.
Don't be annoyed with me;
what else could I do?
Where else could I go?
My father's blood...
runs in my veins and says:
Here I shall live and die
Where else can I go
Raju's mother.
Raju, you're on.
Raju, you're on next.
The microphone.
Now we present...
the most unusual clown.
The bravest of them all.
Our dearest laughing and
singing, Raju!
This is your test, Raju.
Today you must prove to the world
how big the heart of a clown is!
This was near her
when she died.
Yes, this is the circus.
And the show lasts for
three full hours.
And after that...
You're crying?
We say, we shall meet again.
We'll meet again.
If we never part,
how do we meet again?
- I'm not a philosopher.
- Every clown is a philosopher.
I love you.
To meet and to part...
To part and to meet, that's life!
If that's life,
what's death?
I don't know.
You aren't annoyed, are you?
Are you sad?
Take those glasses off.
May I ask you for something?
Whatever I had, I gave you.
My life is all that's left.
I have heard and
seen love talk.
But what did she say in Russian
before she left?
She reminded me of
an old song.
What are you looking at
Mr. Rajendra Kumar?
Some day, my face will be
on an even bigger poster.
You thief!
Running away with my Moti!
Is Moti your dog?
He's really a gem.
A gem or a pearl. He is
mine. If you touch him...
Good grief! Are you a boy
or a film gangster?
How you wield a tin knife!
Shall I show you
how sharp it really is?
Well, kid?
Children don't play with knives.
Get it? Here...
You think I was running away
with your dog?
I'm not that stupid, I've
nothing to eat, how do I feed it?
Was I kidnapping you?
Come, Moti.
- What's your name?
- Minoo. What's yours?
Raju. Have you a job?
Sometimes I get this work.
Putting up posters?
And otherwise?
- Nothing. - That means
we're both in the same business.
Let's try turning tables.
Raju and Minoo.
And Moti too.
But what can we three do?
Minoo, what can't
the three of us do.
Let's shake hands!
Am I not right, Moti? Now you
watch what we three will do.
You've seen the great footpath
circus performers perform.
Now let us see
kind-hearted souls perform.
Put your hands
in your pocket.
Take out some money. Be a rupee,
or two rupees or a five rupees!
One, two rupees...
Five paise, ten paise,
fifteen...
Ten paise, five paise,
three paise...
Your smallest coin will be
like a million for us.
Give freely,
Give generously!
Three Cheers!
Minoo, Moti, Raju... Hurray!
Master, which gutter
are you taking me into?
Hey mister, don't you
dare call this a gutter.
This leads straight to heaven.
Here's heaven.
It's very nice.
You must have paid atleast
a 2000 deposit, how did you do it?
I got it for free. The
poor man who build it died.
He died?
See that bridge.
He came under a train.
Ever since then, people say
his ghost haunts the house.
- His ghost?
- Yes, that's what people think.
That's why no one dares enter.
Aren't you scared of ghosts?
Me? Raju, in this world I see
nothing but ghosts about me.
Why should I fear that poor
man's ghost? Aren't I right?
Yes, I'm not scared of
ghosts either.
What do you mean?
I mean that from today
I'll live here, too!
And the rent?
But... there isn't
any rent to pay.
Well, I'll pay half
of nothing, too.
How is that possible?
The hut is too small
for the three of us.
There's me, Moti and you.
And there is only one bed.
So? I'll sleep on the floor.
Moti can sleep under the bed.
Suppose you're cold at nights?
We'll squeeze in with you.
Don't you dare do that!
I'll smash your head in.
OK! You sleep comfortably on
your bed. I'm used to the floor.
I think we should
get food organised.
Let's share our earnings.
Out with the money!
Yes, of course. Why not?
Here, sit down.
Altogether that makes
three rupees forty five paise.
So that means you get
one rupees and fifteen paise.
One rupee and fifteen
paise are mine.
And one rupee fifteen
paise for Moti.
- Moti gets a share, too?
- Why not? Isn't Moti human?
So Minoo, how was our circus?
- First-class!
- Partner, let's shake on it.
Minoo Master, your hand
is just like girl's hand.
Don't call me a girl!
I'll cut you!
I'll kill you!
Bravo! Now clap, Children!
Saw how the African lion
jumped through the ring?
Now all of you
watch Minno's marvel!
Master Minoo will risk his life.
Through a ring...
...of knives sharp as
swords he will jump.
Come on Master Minoo,
show your wonders!
Be careful. You nearly
tore your expensive shirt.
I will explain everything.
Minoo master lied!
Raju, don't leave me alone.
You're back.
Where were you all night?
In hell or in heaven...
who are you to ask?
I'm your friend, Minoo master.
You're not master
but Miss Minoo.
You're no friend.
You can't be.
What is it? What sin have I
committed that ends friendship?
That sin is called lying.
I can tolerate a lot.
I've lived through a lot...
...unfaithfulness, selfishness
and injustice.
But I can't tolerate lies. Your
friendship was based on a lie.
It was a lie.
But you were responsible for it.
- Me? - Yes, you!
Not you alone, but all men.
You don't know...
how many trials a parentless
girls has to face.
I arrived in Bombay
with high hopes.
I had dreams of becoming an
actress, of working in films.
But it is very tough for a girl
to live respectably in a city.
Very difficult, Raju.
Everyone eyed me with an evil motive.
I decided that in order to
save my honour, I had to die.
The long-haired Meena died.
In her place...
was born a knife-wielding
vagabond. Meenu Master.
The lie isn't necessary.
Here...
What is it?
The end of Raju and Minoo.
Take off that old shirt
and rags and wear this.
Enter the world
as your real self.
After ages I feel
the softness of a sari on me.
You may not believe it.
But that tough Minoo master...
...was once a
shy young girl.
I used to sing and dance.
Everyone used to say
Meena is beautiful!
One day she'll be
a famous artist.
She'll be known everywhere.
Fame will be hers.
When she went out all dressed up
people would forgot their way.
They were right.
People will surely
forget their way.
Now I have accepted the truth.
I didn't know that when the
truth shone, it would dazzle.
You are going?
Yes Meena, I'm leaving.
- You'll leave me alone?
- You've lived alone.
So can you now.
Minoo Master could live alone.
Meena cannot live on her own.
You've transformed me from
Minoo to Meena. You can't leave.
No, Meena...
Don't talk like that.
I've always been hurt
in this game.
It's a dangerous game.
Don't consider my love
for you to be a game.
You've swept the town off its
feet with your qawali, your song.
On every one's lips are the
names of Meena and Raju.
No, it's first Raju
and then Meena.
First the guru then the pupil.
No, Meena; qawali is like love.
There's no first or second.
Two voices blend into one.
Isn't it?
Don't believe me?
Ask him.
- What is this?
- Don't you know?
This is me, isn't it?
It's a clown.
Yes, a joker.
In other words me'.
Hang him upside down. He'll still
laugh. Do anything he'll laugh.
And if one embraces
him lovingly?
- He'll still laugh.
- I'll keep him in my heart.
Is there enough place?
Yes, Raju.
- Where is Moti?
- He's been taken to the dog-pound.
Hang him upside down,
he'll still laugh.
Do anything, he'll laugh.
What's the matter, Raju?
They've taken Moti away.
They'll put an end to his life.
That's the fate of
stray dogs.
He's not a stray dog.
He's a partner in our circus.
We're finished with the circus.
We've got our qawali show now.
- There is no need for Moti.
- Need?
Do you love out of need?
When you needed him you fed him,
gave him a bone.
No more need, so you destroy him.
Today, it's Moti and...
Raju, forgive me!
I didn't mean anything like that.
Don't be angry.
Look, he's imploring you,
too, on my behalf.
When a clown's angry, he
still laughs just like you.
You're right. Meena.
A clown always keeps laughing.
Under any circumstances.
I greet you, the great
qawali singer, Raju.
And of course,
the great Meena.
- Who are you?
- Jannab Kala Narayan Dilgir.
- A wise man, a learned man.
- Do sit down.
The late Agha Hashrat was my teacher.
Unique in the art of drama.
- Maybe he was. But you?
- Kindly listen.
He owns a theatrical company.
How can we help?
If you both perform in our theater,
it will come alive.
None will stand a chance.
- I'll be the leading heroine?
- Of course!
As soon as I saw your show,
I knew you were a born artist.
Did you hear?
He said I'm a born artist.
I'll present you on stage
in great splendour...
- The world will be in awe.
- And why not! You're right.
You are absolutely right, madam.
Do you agree to
Rs. 500 per month?
500?
All right. Accept six hundred.
But no more qawali.
No more singing?
How can that be possible?
Think of this poor man. Who's
paid in advance for our show.
What will become of him?
There's no need.
Now we will act on the
stage in the theatre.
Well said, Miss Meena.
Raju, did you see who
came to the show today?
You'll be dizzy if you know.
Meena, kindly garland
our chief guest.
No amount of garlands
will suffice.
Your dancing is unique.
- Thank you, Mr. Kumar
- You know me?
Who doesn't?
Everyone knows me. But few
recognise who I really am.
I've been your admirer for a
long time. What brings you here?
Aren't your studios in Bombay?
I came to Madras to scout for
new talent for my next film.
This way...
Can I talk to her?
How would you like to work
with me in my next production?
- Me?
- Yes!
I want a new heroine, a new face.
- I'll act opposite you?
- And why not?
But first a screen test.
Can you come with me tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
Today's flight has left.
We'll send the ticket.
Really? Will I really
be acting in a film?
But not just one ticket. Two.
Raju will accompany me.
Where have you been? I've been
looking for you. Where were you?
Right near you.
You didn't turn to look.
This is Raju.
He's taught me everything I know.
It's kind of her to say that.
How could I be so capable?
On the contrary,
she's taught me much.
Raju, did you hear? Mr. Kumar is
going to give me a chance to act.
We'll have to go
to Bombay tomorrow.
What about the theatre?
If I act in films, where's
the need of the theatre?
Miss Meena, you'll receive
two tickets tomorrow.
Remember one thing,
I don't believe in compromises.
Work is work.
And feelings are feelings.
Did I make a mistake?
No, Meena.
You didn't make any mistake.
What shall I do? Tell me.
Do just as Mr. Kumar says.
Work, Meena.
Work is work...
and feelings are feelings.
No one can hold you
back from flying.
Fly high so that you
attain much celebrity status.
Is Madam's make-up kit with you?
Why look at me? Look over there.
From here, too, I see you.
Stop looking at others.
Try looking at yourself.
- Did you call?
- Come in, Raju.
Sit down.
You may leave.
Now, we can talk as friends...
...who love the same art.
Miss Meena praises you a lot.
She says you're famous in the
circus and on stage. A poet-singer.
But unfortunately I have
never seen any of your shows.
You have. But you
didn't recognise me.
- I'd like to ask you a question.
- Yes?
You love Meena?
You ask if I love Meena?
That isn't the question.
It's do I love? '
The answer is 'yes'
I do love...
I love the world, children,
old people, women...
I love men, flowers, stones...
A flower called Meena?
- Yes - Then I want to
tell you this.
Meena is like an uncut diamond.
A song that hasn't been sung.
She can be a great artist.
She can be a big film star.
You mean that you can make her
into a big film star.
Yes, I am interested in her because
I've seen an actress hidden in her.
And if she gets the opportunity,
she'll emerge as a super star!
But for that I will
have to work very hard.
- And you... - Will have to
make a small sacrifice.
You're a famous film star, you
can't understand a joker's feelings.
No one can tie down
this restless wanderer.
No gold, nor silver...
no love can do that.
You're giving Meena a new life.
Remember that giving someone a
new life entails responsibility.
You're so right.
At today's press conference,
I shall present Meena in public.
You'll be there, too?
Whether I'm there
or I'm not there...
Meena will be there on time.
Who is the person
behind your success?
I will answer this question?
There is an unusual wanderer
who is responsible for her success.
Even today, he must be perhaps
wandering all alone!
Thank you! Thank you very much
Now we shall have an interval.
Yes, this is an interval.
The interval could last
15 minutes, 15 hours, 15 months.
But the clown's show
will never be over.
The joker's act isn't over.
Don't go! My act isn't over.
Don't go away. Don't leave!
