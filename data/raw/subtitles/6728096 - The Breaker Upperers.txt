Uh...
Oh.
Now, we didn't find Brendan,
but we...
we did find this.
It was down at the dock.
That's his!
Yep.
Oh my God.
OK. Well, we'd better
head back to HQ.
We've got a very busy day planned.
Yeah, fighting crime
and whatnot, so...
Shall I-? Couldn't leave that
half eaten. Should I...?
- Take that, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Wait.
What?
But...
so what do I do now?
Uh, well, what you don't
do is call the office.
Yeah, it's getting pretty
stressy down there,
so I wouldn't-I wouldn't bother.
Here's our direct line.
Nice to meet you, Annie.
Anna.
Cool.
Congratulations, Brendan.
You're a free man.
Get down.
You're taking me to
the airport, right?
Not a taxi service.
But...
Get out, man!
- Get out.
- Out, out, out, out, out.
Bye, dickhead!
Hello. Breaker Upperers.
Hello. Breaker Upperers.
You wanna be single by March?
Consider it done.
I've had it up to... I've had it
past here. I've had it up to here.
Just because we got gay marriage
doesn't mean we need to...
follow through, you know?
I didn't vote for it.
- Will you support this marriage?
- We will!
We will not!
You weren't gay
eight months ago, Russell!
It's simple, really.
What we do is we take
unhappy couples such as yourself
and consciously, forcibly
and irreversibly uncouple you.
Whoa.
What the hell, David?!
After the job is done, you don't
know us; we don't know you.
- Thank you so much.
You're a free man, David.
Sarah, I think we need
to talk about Jarrod.
The spark is gone. We used to play
'refugee trying to find asylum'.
I'd be the refugee, obviously,
and she'd be a sexy,
sexy UN case manager.
Don't do that any more.
I want whips, I want chains.
I want a hundred shades of grey.
He's not even one.
Cos women are scary. I mean,
they say they're the fairer sex.
Sure, if you go
round with the devil.
Why are you doing this, Sharon?
Get away from me,
evil woman!
I've even entered a relationship
with my neighbour Raewyn.
I moved in with
her for three months.
But, you know, he's just
not getting the message.
Kathy!
Let's give it another 10 minutes
and call it quits, eh?
Kathy!
I want a nice, clean break.
I don't want years of heartache
and stalking and therapy
and possible violence.
Oh! I've been shot!
It wouldn't take much
to knock the old bugger off.
- We don't-
- We don't-
We don't kill people.
We're not breaking any laws, Joseph.
We're simply guiding two souls
towards inevitability.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
I will shoot your faces.
I will shoot your faces!
Go! Go!
Thank you.
- Oh, that's good.
- That's really good.
It's mine! It's mine!
Um, yeah, he's saying that
he didn't appreciate
you talking to your friends
about his vasectomy.
W- No-No-No, I'm not saying you
shouldn't talk to your friends.
No. that's not what I'm saying.
I think you should
talk to your friends.
I think it's good to,
you know, talk to your friends
about your emotional state.
I'm just-I'm actually just reading
from a piece of paper, but, um...
Listen, lady. He doesn't
want to be with you any more,
so suck it up and move on.
Yep. Yep. OK. Well, what I
would suggest is popping down
to your local stationery store,
buying yourself a journal
and start writing some
tear-jerking diary entries.
Thank you for your call.
You are so good at that.
Just gotta find the
fun in it, you know?
Did we order a courier?
Oh, hi. Sorry. I'm Jordan. I've got
an appointment with you guys.
Oh, sorry, Jordan. I was expecting
someone older and whiter.
I thought you were white.
Doesn't matter, though.
I don't see colour.
I mean, I do see colour-there's
nothing wrong with my vision.
Come in. Have a seat.
That's Jodie, our intern.
You can just ignore her.
I'm Jen, and this is Mel.
- Hey, Mel.
- HI.
Shower in a can.
So...
Mel-is that short for Melon?
Melanie.
- French?
- I don't think so.
Ra re?
Maybe.
Anything else you
guys wanna catch up on?
Favourite food? Music? Movies?
Yeah. Yeah.
So, what's your favourite food,
music and movies?
Lasagne, hip hop and
The Last of the Mohicans.
You don't listen to hip hop.
Yeah, I do, and
I've got a CD... of it.
Mm-hm.
So, Jordan, how can we help?
Uh, I wanna break up
with my missus, Miss.
OK. And how long have you and
your missus been together?
Since high school, Miss.
You don't have to call me 'Miss'.
Just call me Jen.
OK, Miss.
And have you attempted breaking up
with her before, Jordan?
Yeah, a couple of times.
See here-I sent her broken hearts
and crying faces,
which obviously, um,
represents sadness and heartbreak.
And then she sent this back.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
And I just couldn't
go through with it.
Well, we can do a phone call,
spell it out.
Yeah, I don't think that'll work.
She's very delicate-
delicate like a delicate flower,
but very persuasive like
a persuasive...
flower.
OK. Well, maybe we could
do something in person.
We could do the
'other woman' package.
Mm.
I could pretend to be your
girlfriend.
Sorry, Jen, I don't
mean to offend you,
but it's more that there's a natural
chemistry between Melon and I.
She's 35.
36, actually.
No, you're lying.
You're not.
Your skin's amazing.
- What product do you use?
- Just over the counter-
OK, fine. Well, it's $500 up front
and $500 at the end of the job.
Do you think this is something
that you could afford?
Easy. Chump change.
Oh yeah.
Oh, you like that, huh?
Yeah, it's all right.
- Are you bored?
- What? No.
- You seem bored.
- No.
Just thinking about somebody else.
Come on! Wake up, Mel! Wake up!
Are you a pussy who
hates her life choices?!
No!
'My life sucks.
'My boyfriend left me
for some fat-arsed bitch
'who's great in the kitchen!'
- Huh?
- Fire up, Mel!
Fire up!
- Let's get that bra off, eh?
- No, no, no, no, no. Bra stays on.
Bra stays on.
Took my T-shirt off.
Are you a loser?
You're a pussy!
Loser!
No mates!
Hit me!
You keep hitting me!
Can you look at me, please?
Not like that. I like to feel
a connection of some kind.
You're literally inside me.
I mean on a human level.
If you want human connection,
you shouldn't be on Tinder.
Yeah, well, if you wanna work out,
you should go to the gym.
I don't like gyms.
I don't like people.
Free shot! Free shot! Go!
Harder!
Put everything into it or
I'm gonna knee you in the head.
Get up.
OK.
- Don't 90 yet.
- I'll go when I want to.
- Oh! Don't go yet.
- I'm gonna do it now.
Dude, I'm starving. Oh.
Oh, I'll just be a sec.
Wait.
W-No! No! No! Not yet!
Oh!
♪ Wah, wah, wah.
♪ Wah-wah-wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
I'm not wearing any undies.
Come on. Guess the singer. Go on.
- ♪ Wah-wah-wah...
- Uh, Prince.
- No.
- Kermit.
- No!
- I give up.
It's Celine Dion.
You sound like a
seal being strangled.
Yeah, that's what she sounds like.
That's why I love her.
Oh, hey, that Tuesday job's
been confirmed. Good.
Man, I hate doing
missing person jobs.
Yeah, they pay the best.
Yeah, but they cry all the time,
and doesn't that lady have kids?
I don't know.
OK. My turn.
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
What the fuck is that?
It's a seal.
Guess the Singer.
The game is called Guess the Singer,
not Guess the Animal.
OK. Seal the singer.
Butterfly kick, butterfly kick,
butterfly kick, butterfly kick,
butterfly kick.
Have you washed these?
No. Why would I?
I've only worn them once today.
Oh God.
- Eh! Food time! Hurry up!
- Oh!
Oh, no, no. Don't go on the lawns.
Don't go on the lawns.
Dad just did them.
OK.
Wow. Your mum's got some new... art.
Oh my God.
Whoa.
I forgot you had a perm.
You know, I thought about making
a curry, and then I thought,
'Oh God, no. I'm still a
novice in that department.'
So I got Sarina,
our cleaner, to make it.
Mel hates curry.
No.
But I thought you were Indian.
I'm half-Indian, half-Irish.
I'm a curried potato.
White people love that joke.
I just don't understand
why you would blow up a photo
of my ex-boyfriend,
print it on corrugated iron
and stick it to your wall.
Oh, here we go.
Because it is art, Jennifer.
It's Kiwiana, which is very
de rigueur.
Don't use that accent, Mum.
It's the correct accent.
I really liked it, Shoz.
Merci beaucoup.
I'm, like, 24 in that photo. Why
don't you blow up a photo of Stan
with that bung-eyed chick he took
to the high school social
and put that up?
Because Stan is married
with three children now.
I mean, if you get a
new partner, that's fine.
Give me a photo.
I'll bung it up on the wall.
Why do you have to have a
photo of me with a man in it?
Why can't you just have a photo
of me in front of a building
or a tree?
Because I don't want to feel sad
every time that I walk up
and down my own hallway.
Christ, Jennifer, you're 40.
When are you going to
start making an effort?
Look, Jennifer, I think
your mother's just worried
that time might be running out.
For what?
For you to become a mother.
Kids are pretty great.
You hate your kids.
No. It's-One of them.
Jennifer, all I'm saying
is there are many options
for you and Mel to start a family.
What? Just because I don't have
a boyfriend doesn't mean I am gay.
I'm just saying you
already live together.
You might want to consider it.
I'm not sure it's something
you can actually consider, Shoz.
I think it's more like something
you're born with, you know,
like-like a genetic mutation-
like X-Men but, like, in vaginas.
Like, boom!
Vulvarine!
We think it would be nice if
Stan donated some of his sperm
so that you could start a family.
- What?
- Uh, that's Incest, Mum!
No. Not if he inserts it into Mel.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
Uh, yeah, I've gotta
check a thing. A... thing.
Me too have to check
the thing, so...
Oh, you reek of sex.
Yeah, you reek of not
getting any.
Oh Christ! That shit is horrible!
- Tastes like air freshener!
- Argh!
Jennifer.
You'd better not be
partaking in my cocaine.
Jesus Christ, Mum, what is this
shit? Ajax? Where did you get it?
Oh, I don't know.
Graham. Graham, where
did you get the cocaine?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't want my septum to fall out.
Why do you keep doing it if
it hurts your face so much?
Because I hate my life!
Argh!
Graham says he hasn't bought
any Cocaine, so that will be Ajax.
Oh my God!
Now is probably not the best time
to tell you this, but, uh,
Joe's back.
How do you know?
I sold him a house.
You sold him a house
and you didn't tell me?
Or me?
Or her, but more importantly, me!
Well, maybe equally
as important-me?
Jen, please, don't freak out.
Not freaking out.
I'm cool. I'm fine.
Y-You're bleeding from the nose.
Oh shit.
Jen.
Jen?
What's happening?
Uh... I don't...
She's having a flashback?
Mwah!
Call me if you get a chance.
Yeah, well, I'm out on the rig, so-
I know, but if you get a chance.
I will.
I will if I get a chance.
You just stay out
of trouble, you, OK?
- OK. I'll see ya.
- Yep.
Argh!
I love you.
Welcome home, sex bag.
Come on. Come on.
Go, baby, 90. Go. Go.
Man, Joe was a cocksucker.
Total cocksucker.
Grandmaster cocksucker.
Not in a good way.
Maybe I should go gay.
Man, you
bang a lot of dudes.
Yes, I do.
How many dudes have you banged?
More dudes than I have women, just.
But the women that I did bang,
I banged them more often.
So I'm not sure how that works out.
Mm-hm.
- Do I talk about being bi too much?
- You talk too much.
Oh, hey, lady!
Hey, I wouldn't
walk down this way.
There's a couple of
creepy dudes back there.
I'd stick to the street, I reckon.
The well-lit street.
OK. Thank you.
No worries. Nice doggie.
Do you find Kristen Stewart hot?
Who's Kristen Stewart?
Oh, no. You're not gay.
OK. What did
you think about that, then?
- Yeah, I didn't mind it, but...
- Nah.
It felt a bit unnatural.
Yeah. I didn't get anything
happening down there at all.
- Nah.
- No activation.
I don't feel like
I need to do that again.
Not a throb. Not one.
OK, don't go on about it.
Don't go on-
- Not one slither of-
- OK, don't go on about it.
- Not one-
- Don't. Enough.
...droplet of-
Not a droplet.
Do you think Joe's
still a cocksucker?
So, yeah, just put that, um-
I thought you were
taking me out to lunch.
What? Uh... have that.
Can we please go?
No, I wanna watch him,
just for a couple of minutes.
Please, OK? It's not all about you.
You're sick. You know that.
You need help.
He treated you like shit.
He just bought you jewellery
and clothes the whole time.
He totally objectified you.
Yeah, I liked it.
- Is he married?
- Yep.
- Children?
- Yeah. Three.
Three!
Sarah, Michelle and Danny.
Yeah, I didn't-I didn't
need to know their names.
Did he ask about me?
I've gotta go. I've gotta
get back to the office.
Hey, hey, hey. Stay low. Stay low.
The kid's text says 'GF'- which
I assumes means 'girlfriend'-
'is standing by the subs'.
What's subs?
Subs is the, um, substitutes.
The players not on the field.
You spotted her yet?
Mel.
Mel
Mel.
H-Hot
- What?
- What?
- Sepa.
- Jordan.
No, the girlfriend.
Have you spotted her yet?
Smash 'em babe.
Go, Jordan!
Fuck 'em up, baby. Fuck 'em up.
Ooh.
OK, braids-
12 o'clock.
That's the way-shut 'em down!
Put 'em on the ground!
I would not describe that
as a delicate flower, Jordan.
OK.
Hey, Mel. You look different.
But you look nice, though.
You look nice. I like it.
Oh, it's just a costume.
Oh.
Did you see any of the game?
I got a try. Did you see it?
I signed your name-
M-E-L-O-N-
Melon... ie.
Hey, you know that
when we do the job
that I have to do all the
talking, eh? Remember?
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
But before you do do the job,
can I please say one thing?
OK.
Well, we're all animals, right?
Well, in the animal kingdom,
there are no rules.
So if a lion and a
panda bear wanna make love,
they just...
The magic just happens.
They let it happen.
People may frown upon it, but
to the lion and the panda bear,
it's all natural.
It's chemicals, Mel.
And,
Melon,
I know you feel the chemicals too.
Uh...
- The fuck, Jordan?
- Oh. Oh.
Is this the bitch you've
been secretly texting?
This better
be a fucking joke.
This better be Candid Camera.
That hasn't been a
show since the '90s.
I don't even know how
you know that reference.
Shh! Do not talk to me, white girl.
- OK, I'm not white-
- Sepa. Sepa, babe.
I didn't mean to do this.
I didn't mean to fall in love.
The heart just goes
where the heart goes.
No harsh feelings?
What the fuck is going on, Jordan?
- I can tell you-
- Well-Well-Well-
Well, this is Mel,
and we are in love.
We are in love.
Hang on a sec.
Oh! Are you telling me
that you're leaving this-
this fine piece of
Maori-Samoan-German-Jewish-Tokelauan
arse
for this ugly old
curry muncher slut?!
OK, you called me white before-
Hey, hey, hey. Don't you
dare talk to her like that.
- Bloody hell!
- Oh shit! Whoa.
Don't push her! I don't want
anything to happen to her
in her condition.
Wh-? What the fuck?
Just go with it.
Tell her, honey. Tell her.
- I-
- She's pregnant.
It's twins.
The fuck?!
We did IVF cos her eggs
are a bit older.
Are you telling me that you didn't
even accidentally knock up
this old bag of shit,
but you got your jizz,
and you put it in
a little fuckin' petri dish,
and you made it swim around
her little raisiny eggs
until they fertilised and then
you syringed them back up
her wrinkly grey-pubed twat?
OK, you don't know
that my pubes are grey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep.
We did exactly that.
And we're moving to
the Gold Coast too,
cos I got a million-dollar contract
with the Titans.
Pull it back. Pull it back.
Is this some, like,
MTV Punk'd type shit?
What about everything we've
been through together?
All the times that
I drove you to rugby?
All the times that I
read you Harry Potter
one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven because of your bad dyslexia?
All the times that
we played Dragon Ball Z?
Kamehame...
- ha.
- Ha.
Does that mean nothing to you?
Babe, I've been trying
to break up with you
for the past couple of months.
That emoji text?
How the hell was I supposed
to understand your emoji text?
I agree. That could
have been quite confusing.
Who the fuck are you?
This is my mum.
That is not your mum.
I know your mum. She's not
a white bitch. She's Maori.
That's racist.
Don't you talk to me
about colour or race,
you colonialising bitches!
OK, what Jordan is trying to say
is that he no longer wants to be
in a relationship with you.
So my suggestion is you take
that information like a woman.
We shake hands, say our good-byes,
and we walk away with our
integrity and our faces intact.
What do you say?
You'd better run!
You better run for your life!
She punched me.
Oh, holy crap! Run!
Jordan, I told you to
let me do the talking!
Get her! Get her! Get her!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Drive!
Drive! Drive! Go! Go! Go! Go! Fast!
Open the door!
What the fuck, Mel?
It's not my fault
that he went rogue!
Guys, talk to me, not about me.
If it's not your fault,
whose fault is it?
This is a $200 skirt, Mel.
I don't know why you spent that
much money on that skirt anyway.
Jen, it's a-
Jen, it's stop sign.
OK? Everyone has to stop at a stop
sign. That's why is says 'stop'.
OK.OK.
Let's all take a deep breath.
And we'll talk about
this like adults.
Oh, also, can you take
me to Mangere, please?
I ran out of credit,
so I can't text my mum.
OK, fuck this.
I'm getting a cab.
Jen...
I'll see you at home.
What? Jen, come on.
Jen!
Hey, I'm sorry I messed
up back there, Melon.
I just...
...had to speak my truth,
which in this case was all lies,
but all of these emoticons
just flowed up inside of me.
You do that to me, Melon.
Like, you make me feel all
of these emoticons, and it just...
makes me wanna.
Makes you wanna what?
All I am saying is mixing with
clients is gonna get messy.
And don't forget our
number one rule-DFTC.
What's DFTC?
DFTC-don't fuck the client.
It's a new rule.
Why do we need a new rule?
I don't know. You know,
to keep ourselves safe.
- From what?
- From complications, STIs.
I don't know, Mel.
- Shit, what's her name again?
- Sheree.
♪ Sheree don't
want to be with you no more.
♪ Sheree don't want to
be with you no more.
♪ Sheree don't want to
be with you no more.
♪ I'm sorry, Jeff, it's over. ♪
I just don't think we should do any
more jobs with horny teenagers,
you know?
What?
You know, I can't help
that people are drawn to me.
- No, you can't.
- Like cats.
I'm allergic to them, but does
that stop them from coming up to-?
It's not like-I don't
put any vibe out to cats.
Cats are just like, 'Mm. Mm. Mm.'
I'm a real pussy magnet.
I just don't have a
good feeling about it.
Call it women's intuition, OK?
Constable Woods?
Annie.
- Anna.
- Anna.
Anna, um...
You remember Constable Glen, right?
Jen Glen? You introduced
yourself as Constable Green.
Uh, yeah. It's my maiden name.
Yeah, all of her family have,
urn, names that rhyme with Glen.
So her mum's name is Gwen,
brother is Ben,
and Dad is...
Glen.
Glen Glen.
Yeah.
Ooh.
I forgot to give him that birthday
present. He's gonna be so mad at me.
- Oh, he wanted fishing stuff.
- Yeah.
Maybe we should head down
to the, urn, fishing tackle-
How are you?
.“Shop.
Fine. Um, yeah.
Uh, I've been putting
up some flyers.
But I'm not well, to be honest.
I have vulvovaginitis.
Oh, it sounds fancy, but it's just
a commonplace yeast infection.
The doctor thinks
it's grief related.
I have to wear maxi pads,
so I had to throw out my handbag.
But I've got this reusable
shopping bag so that I can fit them.
That's good for the environment.
Well, it was nice to bump into you,
Annie, but we've got to actually-
I've been trying to
get a hold of you.
Have you heard anything?
Is there any news?
Um...
- Not yet.
Nothing?
I've just been waiting.
I haven't heard anything either.
I haven't got any friends.
Brendan was it.
I really wanted a baby.
But then I was diagnosed
with severe endometriosis,
so the universe kind of took it
out of my hands-that decision.
It's OK. It's fine.
Have you been to hospital?
I quite like it.
People there.
At any time I could
just press a button,
and then someone will come
in the door and go, 'How are you?'
I mean, I've had a deep sense
of loneliness since I was a child.
Oh my God.
You guys have each other, which is-
must be really great. Is that good?
What's that like?
I'm so sorry.
The Crayfish Orgy.
- Bon Appetit.
- Merci.
Anna, Anna, Anna. Would some seafood
cheer you up a little bit? Do...?
Me?
Yeah. Me-I see food,
I eat it.
Why don't you just hang
outwith us for a bit?
Whoo!
Shamone!
- Drinking is good.
- Oh.
I still feel dead
inside but it's like
the more I drink, the more
I forget how dead I feel.
- Yeah.
- That's why we do It.
- Do you guys have husbands?
- No.
I was a practising bisexual.
Yeah.
- Are you a bisexual, Jen?
- Uh-uh.
But I'm kind of celibate now.
- Celibate?
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.
- Yeah. Me and Jen made a pact.
- Well, it wasn't a pact.
- Yeah, it was a pact.
Emotional attachment is
just, like, not our thing.
Oh.
But it's not sad,
cos, um, I have a very-
I have a very extensive wank bank.
What's a wank bank?
- You've never heard of a wank bank?
- No.
OK. It's like a bank in your
mind of, like, images of people
that get you off.
Like, I just think of old Bruce
Springsteen running on a beach.
Hoo...
Got some activation
down there, you know.
You just scan anyone.
You just scan a room.
I mean, maybe there's consensual
issues there, but anyway, you scan-
You just look at them;
they don't even know?
- And you're just like, 'You're in.'
- Bang.
- You're in.
- You're in.
- You guys are in.
- You're in.
You're in.
- They don't even know.
- No.
Really?
Because who knows how to fuck
yourself better than yourself?
- Am I right?
- Yes!
Yeah!
Do you have one?
Do you have a wank bank, Jen?
No. I live in reality.
I just bang dudes.
- Another round.
- Yes. More tequila.
- What?
- These are terrible.
Oh...
Check that out.
I don't know.
Oh, he does Capoeira.
Is it fighting or is it dancing?
She asked if I'd help put some up.
What did you say?
I said, 'Yeah.'
Are you insane?
Brendan is not missing, and we
don't want anyone to find him.
But that's what friends do. Friends
help each other outwith stuff.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're not friends.
Do it! Do it! Do it!
- She's pathetic.
- Yeah!
Number one...
in the wank bank.
Come on. You were exactly
the same when Joe left.
What?
I'm just being nice,
Jen, you know?
I'm going to the bathroom,
and then we are leaving.
I got one.

Bravo Mel!
Can you smell bacon?
Is my head gonna fall off?
Mel!
She'll be fine. Come on. Let's go.
I don't... Mel!
OK. So you're Constable Wood,
and I'm Constable Glen.
No. Just Constable Green.
Just stick with that.
OK, OK. Well, OK.
So thingummy went for a walk
in the bush and hasn't returned.
What's...
- What's her name?
- Trudy.
Trudy.
Trudy Stallone.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Just...
- What are we doing?
- Just going-
- Why are we here?
- Want to make sure that Anna is OK.
- Are you crazy?
- Yep, yep.
- Fine. Just be back in a sec.
- Mel, just leave her alone.
- No.
- Mel, we don't do follow up care!
- Mel?
- Hey.
Just wanted to check that
your head was... all right.
Oh. It's just a bit
scorched, but fine.
Not as bad as the pole burn.
I looked for you.
I was a bit concussed.
I couldn't find you, probably.
Yeah, um, Jen-
What a drag. She wanted to get home.
I was having a great time.
Would you like to come in?
Oh...
I've got vodka.
Nah. I better not.
I don't think
I should be here alone.
I used to have a cat,
but it died.
I think.
I can't find it.
You know what? I don't-
I was just doing a
routine check, really.
You know, just procedure and all
that, and so on and so forth.
And henceforth, I should probably
get back to the station.
Can I come?
Huh?
If I start crying, you won't even
notice, I promise.
See?
It's barely audible.
Uh...
I'll just get my vodka.
Hi, Jen Glen.
Fuck.
What?
She looked like she was
going to kill herself.
- Did she say that?
- No. But I was picking up a vibe.
She looked like she was gonna
do something to herself.
Is this your work car?
Uh, yeah, yeah. We just, um...
We do a lot of undercover stuff.
Oh, urn, yeah, we-we just
actually busted a big drugs case.
We confiscated that.
Yeah, we were trying to lock
up that bong for a long time.
That was a big win for us,
wasn't it, Constable Glen?
Huge win.
Now, where is
that police station?
It's just up here
on the right, isn't it?
Yep. So this is the,
um, police station.
We've got a couple of
cops out the front.
We've got, um, a
couple of palm trees.
We've got a rubbish
bin at the entrance.
But we're actually heading
back out on the beat today.
I would love to look at
Brendan's file, just quickly.
Oh...
- Uh, Anna, Anna.
- Anna, no.
We shouldn't-
A-At least let me go first,
because I've got the swipey.
Yeah. So we've got a reception area,
we've got some disabled toilets,
we've got a bell,
we've got these guys.
Hey, Jill.
But nothing really much to see,
so we'll probably just head-
Yeah, we should probably-Oh.
Actually, why don't we
check out the hallway?
So, which one is your office?
Um, it's just down here, actually.
If we go up-
Ooh-It's back-What am I thinking?
Oh, it's just like a
bloody rabbit warren in here.
Mm?
Oh, hey, Tony.
- That's Officer Tony.
- Yeah, Dirty Tony.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Fingered me at the office
Christmas party last year twice.
Here we are. Oh.
Oh, hi, guys.
Don't recognise those guys.
They must be new.
Uh, yeah. Here we are.
The office.
Have a seat. It'll be a bit boring
for you, sorry.
Just paperwork.
Mm.
How boring.
Can I see Brendan's file now?
Yeah.
Constable Glen, do you want to
get Brendan's file for... Anna?
Yeah.
Brendan's file. It's called 'Lock
Docs', but it's just a code... name.
- What's going on?
- Um...
Who the hell are you guys?
- Constable Wood. Jen-I'm Glen.
- Glen-Uh, Green-
- Just here from the-
- Wood.
- ...the, uh...
- Yeah.
- What's with those uniforms?

- Where is he?
- Rio.
Why didn't he do it?
Because he's a coward,
like the rest of them.
How long have you
two been running this scheme?
It's not a scheme, Anna. It's a
service. We're service providers.
What you're doing is corrupt.
If by 'corrupt' you mean
helping liberate people
from dysfunctional
relationships, sure.
You work for weak arseholes
who don't have the guts
to talk to their partners.
Anna, your relationship
wasn't working, OK?
How would you know?
Think about it like a big tree
that's blocking out the light.
Now, you could either stand by
and watch that tree die
of natural causes
over about 200 years-
I think you're horrible.
Yeah, well, I don't like your hair!
Look, I think what Jen is trying
to say is that, you know, yeah,
this is yucky, you know.
It's not ideal.
Brendan was a dick, and
all that sort of stuff.
But, you know, you'll
emerge from this a stronger woman.
And when the next situation comes
along, you'll be able to handle it.
And we'd like to think that
we've been a positive part
of that transition for you.
I thought you were my friend.
I- I am your friend.
No, Mel. Friends don't fuck
each other in the arse.
Some friends do.
Like, I don't know if you're
meaning arse-fucking in a bad way
or a good way. Like, arse-fucking
could be nice for some... one,
when it's consensual.
Can we go?
You two are disgusting.
I don't know how you sleep at night.
I really don't.
Anna. Anna!
We are an hour and a half late
for our next job,
and we're probably gonna have
to refund Brendan the money.
This is the sort of thing that
happens when you take charge, Mel!
- You're so mean.
- I'm not mean. I'm professional.
You're heartless.
You know what?
You need to toughen up.
That is a soft knock.
- Just soft. Just-
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
Tuck your shirt in.
- Just tuck It In.
- Just-
Oh!
Surprise!
Oh, uh, sorry.
We thought you were Trudy.
Um, is everything OK?
- Uh, no unfortunately.
- No.
Um...
Trudy went for hike this morning,
and she hasn't returned.
She's officially missing.
Is she?
That's not-I-
- Wow.
- We have a, um...
We didn't talk about
this before, so I don't-
- A note came through on the RT.
- Not on my RT.
Well, maybe yours was off, and-
I don't think it was off,
because I definitely heard
'Coming in, coming
in, coming in, Constable Wood.'
What I was just
gonna say is that we...
there's a search party
out looking for her,
and we've got a hundred
of our best men out there.
Past tense.
They're back. They came back.
No, they came back for lunch,
and then they went back-
And they have some
interesting findings.
They found-
- No, we haven't.
- Yes, we have.
- No.
- Yes, we have found her.
- Yes, we did find her.
- We haven't found anything.
- They found a clue-
- They found a corpse.
- And we're-
- She's dead!
What?
How?
We're still working it out, but I
think maybe she fell into a crevasse
and just... died on impact.
Yeah.
Dead 0... Impact.
D-O-I.
She is dead, dead, dead.
Is that tough enough
for you, Constable Bitch?

You should totally come along.
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Mel?
Why do you always talk to
me like I'm 16 years old?
You know what?
I can't do this any more.
I-I-I feel... stifled.
I- I want to see other people.
I want to do other things.
OK, sure. But not on my throw!
You know what?
You care more about that throw
than you've ever cared about anyone.
And this is coming from someone
who ruined my relationship,
- who stole my boyfriend?
- What?
Joe cheated on both of us, Jen.
I went out with him for three years.
You rooted him for three months,
and you never apologised.
My bad. Keep going.
A decent human being
would've apologised.
Apologise for what?
We didn't even know each other.
Well, should I also apologise
for being the one
that ended up calling you to
tell you Joe was cheating on you?
For letting you sob on
my shoulder every night?
For being a good fucking friend?
You know what?
I have... loved meeting Jordan,
and I have loved sex with Jordan
and meeting Anna,
and hanging outwith Anna.
You know why? Because they're nice
people, and they make me feel good.
You know what kills me?
You can't stand to see me happy.
And I can't be friends with someone
that doesn't want me to be happy.
But you don't have anybody else.
You know what? I don't want to be-
I don't want to be
in this friendship any more.
I'm taking off this stupid bracelet!
OK, fine. Well, I'm
taking my bracelet off.
You give that back to me.
Give me it!
This is my bracelet.
- I made that. Give me that.
- No. No!
- Give me my bracelet!
- No. I will take my bracelet.
I made you that. That's the
rules of friendship bracelets-
you give the bracelet back
when you break the friendship!
And you're-I'm breaking
the friendship.
Fuckin' tight.
Too tight. Supposed to last forever.
It's not supposed to come off.
Fuck.
This is fun, eh?

Thanks so much for coming.
Yeah. It's good to see you.
There is, um, something that I...
I wanted to say, actually.
I love you.
I've always loved you.
You're the love of my life.
Sorry.
Are you kidding?
You're the only man I've ever loved.
I'm sorry. That's...
Sorry.
I'm sorry. That was just... Nervous.
Jen, that was 15 years ago.
We were kids.
I know. But-
I screwed around a lot.
Yeah, well, I know about Mel.
Yeah, yeah. There was Mel,
um, then there was
me, Mel and Sharon;
me, Sharon, Raewyn;
me, Raewyn and Juanita.
Hey, I was a dickhead back then.
I've changed. I coach
the school football team.
I led the walking bus this morning.
I-I-I don't understand.
It's a whole group
of parents get together,
and you walk the kids to school.
I understand what a walking bus is.
I grew up, Jen.
Hi... ma'am.
I know you're not a cop, Mel.
Yeah. I-I know. I just...
Maybe you should
get off my property
before I call the actual police.
Fair enough.
Oh!
Oh my God!
I'm so sorry.
Oh!
Oh! I'll get a cloth.
Sorry about your doormat.
It's fine.
I came to apologise.
OK.
Jen and I aren't friends any more.
I don't really care, Mel.
Fair enough. But...
when me and Jen started
this business, we...
we had the best intentions.
And meeting you reminded me that...
that we hurt people.
And I feel bad about
that, and I'm...
I'm sorry, Anna.
OK.
- Friends?
- I don't think so.
Mm. Oh well. It was worth a shot.
I got in touch with Brendan,
by the way.

lawyer on Monday,
and I'm getting a second opinion

Good for you. That's great.
Thank you.
Divorce sucks, but...

is it fighting or is it dancing?
That's what I say.
Who are you fighting like that?
Yeah. Like, the wind?
Friends?
Goodbye, Mel.
See you round.
No.
I will see you round.
It's New Zealand, so it's...
Chances are, you know?
The door is that way.
Shit. That's gone
right to the back of my eyes.
Oh!
Well, it looks like
you've made a string of bad choices,
and they're all coming
back to bite you.
You're my mother.
You're meant to be cheering me up.
Look, I do want you to
know that we love you, Jen.
We're very, very proud of
everything that you've achieved
in your life so far...
with your high school and...
the one year at university
and the achy-breaky
thingummy company.
Thanks, Mum.
I am sorry to hear
about you and Mel, though.
I'm surprised the friendship
lasted as long as it did, actually.

Oh, sick!
Uh, a lot younger.
- Disgusting.
- He's 18.
Oh, legal.
So, you and... Jordan?
That's-You guys are
doing it together?
- Yeah. He's the dad, so...
- Yeah. Cool.
- How else would I...?
- Great.
Don't get involved.
No. Not me.
I've got to go. I've got to go pick
up... Jordan from Rainbow's End.
That is one unhappy woman.
You're also gonna have
to pay for her groceries.
Yeah.
Thank you, ma'am. Have a good day.
Thank you.
Well, that should be that. All done.
Closed. Sorry, ma'am.
Oh, hell no.
Can you believe this bitch be up
here in my teller window right now?
You guys do everything together?
- You got some sass, honky.
- What do you want?
I want you to help me
break up Jordan and Mel.
Oh!
I don't have to help
you with anything, white girl.
All right. All right.
I understand that, but...
You still love him, right?
Of course, I fuckin' love him.
He's the love of my life,
despite all the revenge fantasy
dreams I've had of slashing
his beautiful fuckin' face off.
Why should she help you, bitch?
Because of...
the sisterhood?
Ha! The sisterhood?
Oh, did she actually say,
'the sisterhood' right now?
Of what? The travelling pants?
That's where she lives.
All right, all right. I know
I'm not part of your sisterhood.
But Mel is like a sister to me,
and we've got our own little,
tiny sisterhood.
And our sisterhood
needs your sisterhood's help.
You feel me?
'You feel me?'
I feel you, girl.
OK, at least let me buy
you a-a rum and Coke,
and we can have a chat about you
getting your rightful man back.
You girls feel like a drink?
Mm. Yes.
There you go.
Mm-hm.
OK.
Yum.
That is some cold-hearted
shit you guys do. Ice cold.
I wouldn't say ice cold.
I like it.
I mean, I think this break has
been really good for me and Jordan.
It's just made me realise
that I really do love him
and maybe I need to
show him more of my Queen Bey
and less of my
Sasha Fierce.
You know?
I have no idea what
you're talking about,
but I am very pleased
you're happy to help.
So I'll come up with a plan-
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No offence Jennifer,
but your guys' last plan sucked.
Well, the plan didn't suck.
The execution of the
plan might have sucked.
Whatever.
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do this my way.
You want to know the
key to Jordan's heart?
Not really.
It's the power...
of song and dance.
Oh.
No, that's my purse.
That's my purse. Can I just
grab my purse back, please?

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
Coach Fitzsimmons here again.
I want to talk about one
of the members of our club.
Hey, I might, um, go get another
fizzy. You want another fizzy?
Uh, nah. I'm OK.
OK.
When he first come to me,
he couldn't tackle to save himself.
So I was, like, 'Boy,
get down low, and.'
You know,.
Hey, uh, can I get a mixture of
fizzy raspberry and fizzy cola?
Fizzy raspberry, fizzy cola, yeah.
Um, maybe more raspberry
than cola. So like 60/40.
60/40.
60 being the raspberry,
and 40 being the cola?
...this person actually
got a contract
with the Gold Coast Titans
Development Squad.
So let's give it up for
Mr Jordan 'Snaky Legs' Marsden.
Come on up!
Awesome opportunity, boy.
I never got it, but good on you.
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, firstly I'd just
like to give thanks to Coach
and the team for this.
As some of youse may know,
I'm about to take up the-
the responsibility of a lifetime.
Uh, Mel, come on up.
Uh, everyone,
this is...
this is, uh, Melon...
or Mel.
Um, a while back we played hop-ons.
Well, I did the hopping on,
and I ended up planting my seed
in her, and now she's pregnant.
You don't-You don't have to clap.
Yeah, um, so, sorry, Coach,
but you might need to call
up those Gold Coast people
and tell them I can't take
that contract right now...
because I need to be in New Zealand,
taking care of my responsibilities,
because in the words
of my mum, Lisa,
'You fucked up, and I sure
as shit ain't paying for it.'
Love you, Mum.
Yeah.
Whoa.
I hear congratulations are in order.
Thank you.
I'm talking about his
Titans offer, white girl.
Oh, nah, thank-thank you, Sepa.
What are you doing?
I don't-I've got no idea.
- What are you wearing?
- I've got no idea.
I'm so sorry for the way
I treated you, baby.
I know I come on a
bit heavy sometimes,
but I enrolled in a course to
tackle my anger management issues.
Can everyone at the bar
please shut the fuck up?!
I've been suspended for a week
because I punched my tutor,
but the point is that I'm
working on myself, you know?
And it's been really illuminating
getting down to the core
of my insecurities.
And what I want you to know
is that you're the one.
You're my man till the end.
My ri till I D.
Ride till I die.
