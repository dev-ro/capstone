Habitat for Humanity.
Okay.
Hey.
Hi.
So, I've been doing some

- For what?
- For saying you can't come on spring break.
I know you didn't mean it.
- Markie.
- Yeah?
I love you so much,

But I can't. I already
signed up for Habitat.

You know what, I know, I know.
It's just...
this is our last
spring break, ever.
And the thought of doing that
without my best friend...
that breaks my heart.
Since high school, you and I
haven't spent more than a week
away from each other.
This is our last chance
to have some fun
before life tears us apart.
I mean, when you
put it that way...
- Yeah.
- No. Still can't.
Okay. Olivia,
what ever happened to
"between you and the world,
I choose you"?

Yes, most of the time.
This just...
you know, isn't
one of those times.
Okay. All right.
You know, I really didn't want
to have to do this, but
you've left me no other choice.
I un-signed you up.
- You what?
- Yeah.
I told Habitat
you got shingles.
Which is kind of funny,
'cause roofs have shingles...
Markie, that is so...
- Brilliant.
- Thank you.
Okay, if you come with us
for this one week
of spring break debauchery, we
will all build houses with you
for two weeks over the summer.

It'll help with your

I'm sorry for the wait.
She has written
something for you.
What is it?
She would not let me read it.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Thank you for seeing us,
Miss Reyes.
"The mission was a convent
"where young women
went to find God.
"We were girls, so we played
silly games like Hide and Seek.
"But the priest
who ran the convent
"forced us to play
his own game.
"He let us hide, but then
he took the one he found.
"His pleasure was our pain.
"We suffered in silence.
"Then one of the girls
told a secret.
"She knew spells
that could call spirits,
"so she summoned
a demon named Calux.
He possessed our game."
Possessed the game?
"Demons possess people, places,
objects, even ideas."
Uh, uh...
"Calux is a trickster.
"That night, when the priest
found his victim,
"she was possessed by Calux.
"She hid the priest's body
in the mission...
"in pieces.
"It took them a week
to find his head.
"But Calux didn't want to stop.
"He made us keep playing.
Many of my sisters died."
Wait, how did you
and the others escape?
"The person
who released the demon
"can trap it
with a simple ritual,
but only by his own hand."
Uh, this is the spell?
Uh, it's in Spanish.
OLIVIA: "The spell must be
repeated seven times
"and a sacrifice must be placed
in a pot sealed with wax.
"As long as the pot
stays sealed in the mission,
the door we opened for Calux
will also be sealed."
Wait, I've seen
that pot before.
Yeah. Look.
But when I saw it,
it was broken
and there was something inside
it and it smelled rotten.
(INEZ GASPS)

"Whoever broke the pot
will have to do the same."
What was it?
The sacrifice.

BRAD: It's been a few years
since AP Spanish,
but I think it says,
"I have called upon an evil.
Silence my voice,
so the evil is no more."
So when Carter and his friends
broke the pot at the mission...
The demon was freed
and possessed their game
of Truth or Dare.
And we have to find
whoever broke that pot.
But Giselle said somebody
named Sam trashed the place.
And we have no idea who Sam is.
- Or if he's even still alive.
- And if we do find him...
What?
"Hi, Sam. Do you mind
cutting out your tongue
and sealing it in this
lovely handmade pot?"
I'll check
Giselle's Facebook again,
