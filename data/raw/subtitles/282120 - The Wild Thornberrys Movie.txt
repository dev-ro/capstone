l'm Eliza Thornberry.
Part of your average family.
l've got a dad and a mom.
And a sister.
There's Donnie. We found him.
And Darwin...he found us.
We travel all over the world.
See, my dad hosts this nature show,
and my mom shoots it.
And along the way,
something amazing happened.
l freed a warthog
who was really a shaman.
Shaman Mnyambo.
He granted me
the power to talk to animals.
lt's really cool...but totally secret.
And that was just the beginning
of my biggest adventure ever.
And now, Phaedra the Magnificent
will walk the Circle of Destiny!
Circle of Destiny, indeed!
Phew! Eliza, your friend stinks.
And those tusks
could poke an eye out.
Darwin, chill.
- Phaedra, take us around that tree.
- Sure.
Here's how our moms make us go.
They nudge the back of our necks
with their trunks.
- Really? Like this?
- That's it!
And if she wanted us to turn around,
she'd nudge one side.
Oh, cool!
Rub behind the ear and
the elephant turns. Fascinating!
Eliza, can we go now?
My butt's gone to sleep.
OK, Darwin.
- Bye, Eliza.
- Bye, Phaedra.
Bye...chimp!
l think l hear your grandmumsy
opening a fresh tin of pudding.
- Darwin, listen.
- To what? l don't hear a thing.
That's what l mean. lt's too quiet.
lt's a shame you couldn't spend
more time with us, Mumsy.
Two weeks is more than enough.
Your father gets a bit daft
when left on his own too long.
He's probably searched the entire
estate for his reading glasses.
Good thing l take after you,
eh, Mumsy?
Marianne, have you had any luck
locating my binoculars?
Try around your neck!
Bad news!
Jungle Boy used the teapot
to store his grub-worms.
Dad! Mom! Stampede!
Battle stations, everybody!
Mumsy! Stand absolutely still!
They're not carnivores.
The gazelle is quite harmless.
Unless you happen to be
a tuft of grass!
lt's Akela!
- Does this sort of thing happen often?
- No.
Thank goodness!
Cordelia, l hate to leave you, but we
need to get some footage before dark.
Yes, Mumsy.
Will you be all right here?
Don't worry. The girls and l will have
a nice quiet evening together.
See you later, then! Bye bye!
Just when we get something cool
to drive, l have to be grounded!
Certainly you're grounded.
You tied Donnie to a termite mound.
Hey, he was happy.
- Eliza, where are you going?
- Just going for a walk!
Have we forgotten
about that cheetah?
lt's OK, Grandmumsy,
l do it all the time.
Deborah, does your sister...?
Talk like a monkey,
dress like a geek? Yeah!
Come on,
Akela's cubs must be nearby.
Cheetah cubs? To them,
l'm a walking snack pack!
- Hey, guys!
- lt's Eliza!
Oh, you've grown so big.
Hey, where's Tally?
Here l am! You should see me run.
l'm really fast now.
Fast? As in ''able to outrun
defenceless chimps''?
You guys remember Darwin.
l've got an idea.
- Let's have a race.
- Yeah! Me first.
Children! lt's time for dinner.
- Not me, l'm skin and bones.
- Mom, Eliza wants us to race.
No, the plains are too dangerous
for little ones like you.
But l'll be with them.
l'd never let anything happen.
You can trust me.
Please, Mom!
All right, Eliza.
But keep an eye on them.
And don't go beyond the acacia tree.
Hey, slowpokes, l'm winning!
Who are you calling slowpoke?
Eliza, you've passed the acacia tree!
Just barely!
Don't worry, we'll be fine.
Poachers!
Run!
Eliza!
No!
Eliza!
Give him back!
He's just a baby!
Deborah, bring the Commvee
straight away!
l wish l could, but l'm grounded!
Debbie, now!
Deborah, slow down immediately!
Sorry, Grandmumsy. Dad's orders.
Donnie, this is no time
for the wedgie dance!
Will somebody do something?
Somebody?
We'll discuss your impertinence later,
young lady!
Follow that helicopter!
l couldn't have had a sister
who plays with dolls.
Hello, Mumsy. Having a jolly holiday?
Nigel, we must discuss
your children's manners.
We're equally as proud,
but now's not the time.
My baby!
My baby.
We can't just sit here.
We have to find those poachers.
You were almost killed.
Let Jomo take care of them.
- But, Mom, l have to save Tally.
- Who?
That's what l call the cheetah cub.
She names man-eating wild animals?
Names 'em, plays with 'em,
talks in monkey to 'em!
Debbie, enough!
- Could you identify this man, Eliza?
- No. He shined a light in my eyes.
But the handle of his knife was
carved in the shape of a falcon.
That'll help, won't it?
There are many knives,
many poachers.
- But l have to find Tally.
- Eliza, you must leave this to us.
Promise me, you will never go off
alone at night.
l promise.
Good girl.
Nigel, l will call if l hear anything.
- Good night, all.
- Thank you, Jomo.
Eliza! Don't go out
in the savannah at night.
Yeah, right! She and the monkey
are always sneaking off!
- What?
- Debbie!
l've covered long enough.
She once fed one of my protein bars
to a Komodo dragon!
And in wherever-land,
she rode a Siberian tiger!
And ask about the time she was
dancing with crazy dingoes!
- What?
- That's not the half of it!
- Eliza!
- Thanks, Deb!
Nigel...l don't know what to do.
Well, l do! Elizabeth has no regard
for her own safety.
We have discussed this for years.
She needs a structured environment.
One such as a boarding school
back in London!
Hold on! She messes up and
gets to go to boarding school?
Mumsy, that's rather drastic.
Need l remind you, that it was
in the confines of boarding school
that you received your education,
not here in the wild?
You don't think it's civilised for a girl
to play with cheetahs and chimps?
Hello! What about me?
Do l look civilised?
Frankly, no.
But l'm afraid
it's much too late for you.
Mom, Dad, l can't leave!
Tally never would've been out
on the plains if it wasn't for me.
- lt's all my fault.
- How?
- l have to go back out there!
- No!
We make these rules for a reason.
lf l have to send you away
to be safe, l will.
Dad? Please!
Poppet, your intentions are noble,
but you're just too young.
l'm sorry.
We agreed, when we took this job,
we wouldn't split up the family.
We'd keep the children
with us on the road.
l remember, dearest.
Oh, Nigel.
Are we doing the right thing?
You heard Eliza. She blames herself
for this unfortunate incident.
She'll never stop
until she finds that cub.
She's quite fearless, you know.
She takes after her father.
That poor girl.
Boarding school? l never heard
of anything so ridiculous!
Did anyone bother to ask my opinion?
l wish l could tell them
l talk to animals.
No! Then you'll lose your power,
and we'll never talk again!
- How will l know what Debbie's saying?
- Calm down, l won't break the rule.
Good.
Now, about this boarding school,
l can't take gym class,
because those tight shorts
show off my problem area.
Dar...you can't come with me.
Darwin, come back!
- Whatever is the matter with Darwin?
- He saw me pack my suitcase.
- l guess he figured out l'm leaving.
- Very intuitive, that chimp.
l'm sorry about all this, Dad.
l'm not sure l wouldn't have done
the same thing.
ln fact, l went up against poachers
myself once,
to save an elephant, remember?
l remember.
Come, let me show you
where we're headed next. The Congo.
- To look for forest elephants?
- Yes. lf we can find any.
There's an old, old Baaka legend,
that tells of a solar eclipse,
when thousands of elephants
made their way to Tembo Valley.
l wonder why.
Nobody knows. But there's an eclipse
in a few weeks in this exact spot.
And l intend to witness it first hand.
l wish l could see it with you, Dad.
Eliza, l received this medal
when l was in boarding school.
Perhaps you'd like to take it, for luck.
''Awarded for bravery.''
Oh...it was nothing, really.
A blazing building, twenty students
trapped, a makeshift rope ladder...
Well, never mind.
The point is you will have
your own challenges, Poppet,
and l predict,
you will meet them splendidly.
l looked everywhere for Darwin.
l didn't get to say goodbye.
l'm sorry, honey.
You'll see him again soon.
l love you.
l'll miss you, Mom.
You won't leave without him, Dad?
Of course not, Poppet.
Here's what you can get me
in London: CDs, boots, T-shirts.
Basically, anything cool.
Don't forget: ''cool''.
Elizabeth! lt's time for take-off!
Kiss your natural wilderness
girlhood goodbye!
Bye, Dad.
Look at that.
ls that a new girl?
Darwin!
You didn't think l'd let you get civilised
without me, did you?
- You can't be here!
- lt's a miracle l survived the hold!
Your bags are not handled
with care.
They don't allow chimps in school.
They'll change their mind
when they meet me!
Let's look at my new home.
Small yet charming.
Not much natural light,
but we've had enough of nature.
Dibs on this bed!
Feel those springs, firm yet flexible.
Could you lend me your cashmere
sweater for the dance?
- Someone's coming.
- Room service? l like school already!
Darwin, you can't be here!
But why?
- l'm a fast learner and...
- l can see your feet!
Let me in!
Are you still quibbling about
that 2% difference in our DNA?
Just be quiet
until l figure out what to do.
l'm Eliza Thornberry.
Guess we're room-mates.
So it appears.
l'm Sarah Wellington.
Have you been romping
on my bed?
Just trying out the springs.
Firm yet flexible.
Perhaps we should
negotiate a few issues.
You stay on your side
and l stay on mine.
My things shall be off-limits
as they are antique and expensive.
This perfume is French.
And don't even dream
about wearing my clothes.
No matter how tempting the urge.
l see that you've already rooted
through my wardrobe.
Sarah!
Want one of my mom's
home-made cookies?
l might have a use for you yet.
lt's so great to talk to you guys.
You have no idea how awful it's been.
Go on, Eliza,
tell Reggie your troubles.
l don't suppose you have any
of those cheesy snacks?
Cheese Munchies? Right here.
Brilliant!
Now, what's the problem?
l miss my friends in Africa.
You should see it there, Reggie.
l've even met some squirrels who fly.
Fly? Like a bird?
Don't like the sound of that!
l heard her family lives
in the jungle in a motor home!
And she bathes where animals drink!
Next she'll be bringing animals
into my room!
- Eliza, can you hear me? lt's Mom!
- And your dear old Dad!
- What did you say, honey?
- Has Jomo found Tally?
Sorry, Poppet, no.
ln fact, the poachers disappeared
without a trace.
- Tell her about Darwin.
- l was leading up to that.
Poodles, l'm afraid
we've lost track of Darwin.
He'll be all right. He's probably
foraging for bugs right now!
The shepherd's pie is heavenly.
But why do they put
these green things in it?
They look like bunny poop!
- Honey, is someone there?
- Just my room-mate, Sarah.
Mom, please don't forget
about Tally.
We won't.
We told Jomo where we're headed.
Try to have fun with your new friends.
She's making friends?
Give me that!
Hi. Here's what's going on
with my life.
Donnie's now half-goat,
my hair is half-terrier,
and we're heading into the abyss
where there's no teen interaction! Bye!
Oh, Debbie!
Debbie? Mom? Dad?
Donnie?
We're all a bit curious.
Have you ever seen a tiger up close?
- Close enough to pet.
- Oh, really?
Tigers, bears, Komodo dragons...
Once, we were in the Arctic
and l hung out with this polar bear.
Seems my room-mate
is making friends.
My friends!
- They're really gentle...
- Sarah, Eliza swam with whales.
- lsn't that lovely?
- Tell us more, Eliza.
Darwin!
l know! Don't l look fetching?
Where was l? Swimming
with dingoes...l mean dolphins...
Enough about me.
Anybody try the boiled cabbage?
l'm going back for seconds.
Anyone else?
- Who's that girl?
- Never seen her before.
- ls she Eliza's friend?
- That's my monogram!
Who are you and
why are you wearing my new blazer?
There's an ape in my uniform!
Give it back! Give it back!
- Did it escape from the zoo?
- Darwin, no!
Food fight, everyone!
Come back!
Girls! Girls! Food is for eating!
Food is for...
This is the best meal we've ever had!
Miss Thornberry, your grandmother
will hear of this in the morning.
And when we revive her, l'm sure
she'll be gravely disappointed.
Now, say goodbye to your pet...
...and come along!
Eliza, don't leave me in this place,
l'll never last the night!
No offence. l'm sure you're very nice.
''Thunder'', is it?
- How horsy!
- l'll come see you in the morning, Dar.
Trot along, lassie.
Your friend will be fine with me.
Thanks, Thunder.
Miss Thornberry? Come along!
l need a hot bath and a good meal.
You're in luck. They'll be bringing
the hay round any minute.
- l'm to eat hay?
- Aye, and sweet crunchy oats, too.
Oh, that changes everything.
l'm beginning to see
why they call you Thunder.
- Never mind. Where's the bathroom?
- You're standing on it!
Did Mrs Fairgood make him
go to the zoo?
- Where did he sleep?
- How did you smuggle him?
Darwin decided...
l mean, it was easy.
Hiding him from Sarah,
that's a different story.
Miss Sarah Wellington thinks
she's the bee's knees!
Why would you ever come here,
where it's so boring?
l got into trouble. l snuck out...
There were poachers hunting...
- Poachers?
- With guns?
Go on, Eliza.
There were three cheetah cubs
l knew. Like kittens, only wild.
We were running
when we heard shots.
A man dropped from a helicopter
on a ladder and...
...grabbed the one l named Tally.
l tried to save him,
but they cut the ladder and...l fell.
Tally was gone.
Poor Tally.
l think he's alive. l just feel it.
This is terrible!
Can't we write letters or something?
- Let's have a bake sale!
- Let us help!
Thanks, but...
What's going on in my room?
Sarah, Eliza was just telling us
the most awful story
about...Tally.
Never mind.
l've been filling out a report
and am quite tired.
- You'll all have to go.
- Goodnight, Eliza.
Goodnight, Sarah.
'Night, you guys!
l still can't believe you harboured
a wild animal in my room...
There are peas in my bed!
Tally? Tally!
Tally! l knew you were alive.
Eliza, help me!
Tally?
Tally!
l gave you this gift
for a reason, Eliza.
Shaman Mnyambo?
You must not waste time.
You must go to your destiny. Go!
What do you mean?
Where am l supposed to go?
Shaman?
Tally is alive. Go save him, Eliza.
Go! Go!
Shaman Mnyambo's right.
l have to go.
What are you doing?
l have to leave.
- l'm calling Mrs Fairgood.
- No! You have to keep this a secret.
Do you have a credit card
for tickets to Africa?
- l won't do this.
- My parents will pay you back.
- No one will know until it's all over.
- What's over?
You're acting so odd.
l'm reporting you at once.
Sarah, please, it's a matter
of life and death.
l have to go now
and l really need your help. Please!
Just think, you'll get the room
all to yourself again.
Would you prefer aisle or window?
Darwin, wake up!
What?
l've tried to keep track of the days,
but they've blurred into months!
Dar, it's only been four hours.
lt's certainly better than riding
in the hold, but l don't understand...
Shh! l'll tell you
after the plane takes off.
Fine!
Shh! Stop fidgeting!
l can't help it, l've got hay in my skirt.
She has that hairy disease.
We're going to see
a special doctor in Nairobi.
l'll find you, Tally.
l promise.
We'll be gone until after the eclipse.
Will you be all right with Donnie?
This will be the highlight
of my young life!
That's the spirit, Poodles!
Dad, have you completely lost
your ability to recognise sarcasm?
l'm not sure l ever had it.
Stay close to camp. lf you're lucky,
you might see a hyena roving about!
Excuse me, while l go find
a container for my joy.
Very well, we'll wait right here.
Oh...that's sarcasm, isn't it?
You do that rather frequently,
don't you?
Debbie, just how long
is this sulking going to go on?
Another 35-40 minutes.
Then l'll start up again tomorrow.
Get some rest.
l know it must be draining.
We'll call you on the short wave.
Be careful. And have a good time!
No problem.
l'll take the Congo-Com for a spin.
Absolutely not!
But do have fun!
That is so wrong.
Help! The poachers...
l've been shot!
- Darwin, get up.
- What?
Excuse me...
A rhino's been shot.
You have to let me off this train!
Hang on, we'll get help.
You'll be OK.
They shot me...at the river.
They were trying to take my horn,
when l ran away.
Help! Help!
Please help me!
This rhino's been shot!
- Hold this, right here.
- ls he still alive?
Barely. But l think l can save him.
You're a very brave young lady.
We saw you jump from that train.
l had to save this rhino...
That's the knife from the man
who took Tally.
- Keep applying pressure.
- Sorry, l just...
- Thank goodness, the authorities.
- What happened here?
Poachers shot him at the river.
Find them.
They took a cheetah cub.
l recognised their knife.
Call Jomo Mbelie!
- You know Jomo?
- Yes, he's friends with my father.
Tell him Eliza found the knife.
We were just at the river,
there were no poachers.
l'm Sloan Blackburn. We're studying
the endangered wildlife.
We have to get this poor guy
to our camp.
My wife, Bree.
She's a wildlife veterinarian.
We'll take him to the rhino sanctuary.
Eliza, they'll take care of him,
don't worry.
Can we give you a lift? You shouldn't
be alone with poachers around.
No, thanks. Our camp's not too far.
We have to get back to our work,
but l hope we see you again.
Me, too.
Thanks for your help. Bye!
Come on.
We have to find those poachers.
We have to find your parents.
You saw what those poachers did.
- But if they're nearby, Tally is, too.
- No!
lf those awful people see you again,
they'll hurt you.
And l'm not going to let that happen.
You're right, Darwin.
We can't do this alone.
Hurry, we'll find my parents' camp.
lt's not far, is it?
We'll get there...by morning.
l wish we'd never left school.
Thunder said there'd be days like this.
This dude Jack plants these
magic beans, 'cause he's hungry.
Then, a mondo beanstalk
grows way up into the clouds.
Bushbabies! How annoying!
Jack, who's totally buff,
climbs up the beanstalk
and finds a golden goose,
a golden harp and a big, scary...
...giant?
Donnie?
Donnie!
Donnie! Donnie!
Radcliffe! You never told me
how to land!
- Grandmumsy?
- lt's all in the knees, Cordy!
- Colonel?
- You're looking well, Deborah!
Do we have a kiss for Grandpapa?
l knew l shouldn't have brought
the good china!
Debbie, dreadful news.
Your sister has run away from school.
Under cover of night...with Darwin!
Excuse me, did you say
the monkey got to go to London?
Debbie, are you there? Over.
- Guess who's here?
- Don't alarm your parents.
She means there's no need
for Marianne to blame her
a minute earlier than necessary!
Sorry.
Eliza was seen boarding a train
for the Congo. We'll take her back.
Debbie! Who's there?
Some cute bushbabies!
Did l just hear you call
a wild animal ''cute''?
That's called sarcasm, dearest.
Sure, you can ride with us.
My owner will never know.
How did l end up here...
amongst chickens?
Donnie, this may look like
a shark cage, but it's a playpen.
lt's where nice little boys play, when
their sisters want peace and quiet.
Hey, Donnie!
lf it isn't the boarding school dropout
and her sidekick, Chimp-o!
- l need to talk to Mom and Dad.
- They're not here.
Talk to me and pretend l'm listening.
- Where are they?
- ln the jungle, filming.
- But the eclipse isn't until tomorrow.
- Whatever.
Fine. l'll call them on the radio.
Don't go in there.
- What are they doing here?
- Taking you back to England.
l'm not going back.
l came back to find Tally.
- l just need Dad's help.
- What's wrong with you?
You finally get a chance
to escape our jail,
instead you come back
like some freaky homing pigeon,
and wreck my chance
of ever getting out of this place.
l am not going to slow dance
at my prom with some baboon!
