Hello, My name is Elsa
Beskow and I'm going...
to tell you about one of my
colleges in the art world...
Nobody know the exact
hour of his birth...
It was either at 5 PM
"ala cinco de la tarde"
or during the midnight hour,
which he himself claimed...
He, one of the strangest
men of our time...
He, a decendent of the
16th century knight...
" Juan de Leon"
Who was killed in the war
between Loja and Granada
He, Pablo Picasso...
whom was born in Málaga
almost a century ago
Pablo was brought up
in the poor area of Málaga
His mother - Doña Maria - was...
Happy
Tender
Independent
Sensitive
Warm blooded
Proud
and affectionate
But his father - Don José - was
very sloppy in his work
The young Pablo Picasso soon
proved to be quite artistic.
The proud father decided to introduce
him to the art-academy in Madrid
"The rain in Spain stays
mainly in the plain"
There was a genie in the bottle
a magical force that would
make his art come to live
Madrid
The education at the
academy was academic
Attention!
Coal!
One
Two
Fart!
Neither of his parents could
ever come to grips with...
Don José's near
death experience.
The tension at home grew
odious for the young artist...
and he decided to leave.
It was the
new years eve of 1899
The Parisians outside
celebrated with Champagne...
dancing in the streets
and fire-works.
Paris, 1910
Pablo Picasso was
still poor and hungry
He paints and paints and paints
But selling and selling and selling
he is NOT
That was the birth of Cubism
Picasso returned to the
vagabonds in the circus world...
These warm hearted
artistic souls...
whom - free of charge - gave
there pathetic faces...
to the artist
The American author
Gertrude Stein's salon...
was the centre of the
French artworld...
and her constant companion...
her chaperon
Alice B. Toklas
Now Picasso was at the centre
of the Parisian art world...
with people such as
[John] Brack...
[Henri] Matisse...
Fernand Lege...
Pompidou...
entrecôte...
Carl Larsson...
Popeye [Karl-Alfred]...
Loulou...
Dodo...
Joujou...
Clo-clo...
Margot...
Frou-frou..
Jenny Nyström...

Concelett...
an omelette...
and Rembrandt
And there is Hemmingway
sitting with his knitting
There was also a Erik Satie the
often misunderstood composer
Guillaume Apollinaire,
the absurdist poet...
Henri Rousseau, the
painting customs officer
Vincent van Gogh,
the guy with the ear
And not less than two
Toulouse-Lautrec
And the famous Mimi...
the woman that inspired Puccini
to write "your hands are so cold"
What is a man, or even an
artist other than a small flake...
in the vast and
silent universe?
Well then!
Let's stop for a minute to
examine the regular life...
of a lonely artist in
the 1910's
Is there anything lonelier
then a genius?
Th... that is relatively
lonelier than a genius?
He rose early in the morning,
put on his clothes...
humming of a cheerful
morning-song...
and then he went outside...
to prepared himself for
an intensive workday...
with a long brisk walk
in "Bois de Boulogne"
LONG
BRISK!
He stopped every
now and then...
to "skissa"
[skissa similar to kissa=urinate]
Skissa=To sketch
Here the master is painting
a pair of eyeglasses
A... a bicycle...
A painting!
Pablo Picasso continued
wrestling with his art
The Swedish-American
multi-millionaire...
Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim
loved art...
and artists
Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim...
was one of the many people that
didn't understand Picasso's work...
but she knew it was expensive,
hence immortal.
Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim became
a persistent pester for Picasso
She strived to be part of his
life and work, at any price
He fled to the tranquillity
of nature
It's not easy being famous.
To make his friend happy...
the kind-hearted Rousseau
invited Pablo...
and Apollinaire to his
secret forest...
where no human-being had set
foot except Rousseau himself.
Guillaume Apollinaire read one
of his deeply philosophical poems...
about the human essence,
This was to be the onset to the
memorable masquerade ball...
which Picasso held in his salon,
in honour of his friend Rousseau.
What a fabulous crowd!
There was Jean Cocteau...
Enrico Caruso
Brack and Matisse was
seen off the shelf
Marie and Pierre Curie
[Alexander] Graham Bell, the
inventor of the telephone-kiosk
Emperor Wilhem II was dancing
with his elegant wife
There was Lenin
And the young
Winston Churchill
Even the French president was
there, dressed as a balloon
It was an unforgettable
farewell party for Rousseau...
the little customs officer,
the king of imagination!
The year was 1914
The future had never
looked so bright...
workers and artists
joined together...
people would never stand
against each other...
faith in the international solidarity
was equally strong as...
the faith in the blessing
of the industrial era.
The optimistic view of development
in the future was stronger than ever...
The machines were supposed
to save the world!
Freedom [Liberté]
Equality [Égalité]
Fraternity [Fraternité]
Would at long
last come true
In short...
it was the time
of a new dawn.
There would never be another war...
a new generation of artists came
to Paris to build a better world.
And that's why Picasso made
decorations and costumes...
for the famous
Russian ballet
Djagilev's production, Erik
Satie's music and...
Picasso's décor would
dumbfound the world.
The world première
was in London.
Don José was responsible for catering
It was three hours
before the première...
the tension was high.
Picasso had had enough with
the foul stench of high society
He fled from
Djagilev and Olga
He hid in a little obscure
cabaret in Monparnas, Paris
Picasso was spellbound
by Sirkka's singing...
and it would lead
him to his destiny
