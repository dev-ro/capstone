TIM: You gonna drive this
deathtrap to California?
WILLY:
You saying I'm not?
TIM:
You won't make it past that tree.
WILLY: Novalee, you plan on
leaving today?
She's in the bathroom.
Why don't she just move into the damn
bathroom? Get all the little photos.
NOVALEE:
I'm ready.
Now, hold on. Now I gotta go.
We'll miss you, Novalee.
The floor's missing.
He got the whole car for $80.
He had to fix everything on it.
And here's the best part:
No fives.
- You and your fives.
- What fives?
On my fifth birthday, my mama ran off
with an umpire and never came back.
After I dropped out of school and was
waiting tables, a lady went crazy.
When I tried to calm her, she jumped
at me and cut me from wrist to elbow.
- What's that got to do with fives?
- Took 55 stitches to close her up.
I don't like fives.
That's it. Let's hit it! Let's go!
Hon?
Will you take a picture
with my new camera?
Wait.
All right, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on.
- Sweetie, call me, okay?
- All right.
Bye.
NOVALEE:
All right, bye.
Finally, it's already five.
Five?
I hope we can find a place
that overlooks the ocean.
Hell, you can't see the ocean
from Bakersfield.
Well, maybe a pond, then.
I want to get one of those tables
with an umbrella over it...
...where we can sit with the baby
and watch the sun go down.
I've never lived anyplace
that didn't have wheels.
Hey. Hey.

Hey!
Hey, Novalee. Wake up!
You sound like a damn pig!
What the hell's the matter with you?
And where are your shoes?
That's just great. That's great.
My feet are swollen.
I had to take them off.
NOVALEE:
Ooh!
Want to feel the baby?
Here.
Feel that?
WILLY:
No.
Right there.
Feel that little "bomp, bomp, bomp"?
That's where the heart is.
Couldn't prove it by me.
- Ooh!
- Would you...? The hell...?
Wal-Mart. I can go to the bathroom.

I have to get some house shoes.
I gotta get some kind of shoes.
- All right, get you some house shoes.
- Come on.
Get you some green polka dot
house shoes.
WILLY: That way, everyone will be
sure to notice you.

Attention, Wal-Mart shoppers.

- All the way back.
Thank you.

a beautiful child here.
An award-winning picture.
It might end up on a cereal box.

NOVALEE:
Ahh!

Mommy!
PATTY: Ma'am?
- Hm?
PATTY: Here's your change.
- Sorry.
Five dollars and 55 cents.
No!
Ma'am!
Ma'am. Ma'am?
You left these at the counter.
And your change.
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.
I just...
My boyfriend...
...went to get the car fixed.
He'll pick me up.
Well, have a nice day.
Hey.
Ruth Ann Mott!
Just look at you.
Little Ruth Ann!
I haven't seen you
since your mama passed.
What's that, 10, 11 years?
- I'm not...
- Don't you remember?
I'm Sister Husband.
Oh, you remember me.
You used to call me "Telma" because
you couldn't say "Thelma."
Can you say "Thelma"?
- Thelma.
- Good. Oh.
Good Lord, look at you.
Having a baby.
You just move home, Ruth Ann?
See, I'm not...
You know what they say:
Home is where your history begins.
Home is where they catch you
when you fall.
That's what Brother Husband said.
Brother Husband?
Was he your husband?
No, he was my brother.
A real man of God.
You read the Bible?
Not as much as I should.
Good. I think that's good.
Folks read too much of it,
they get confused.
That's why I like to hand out just
one chapter at a time.
That way, folks can deal
with their confusion as it comes.
Come on. Come on.
You're coming with me. Come on.
I'm not gonna let you
get away empty-handed.
Now, on behalf of the Merchants
and Businessmen's Association...
...of the city of Sequoyah, Oklahoma,
I give you this basket of gifts...
...and merchandise.
- Thank you.
- Look, Ruth Ann.
You got discount coupons and matches,
a map of the city, emery boards.
Oh, yeah. Now, you see this
little appointment book?
I ran out of these last week, so I
had to put my appointments in one.
If you're not an alcoholic,
you'll know they aren't yours.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Good. I think that's good.
Oh, oh, yeah, one more thing.
NOVALEE:
What is that?
This is a buckeye tree.
Brings you good luck.
Here, take it.
There.
Well, goodbye, Ruth Ann.
It was real nice to see you again.
And welcome home!
I'm in the phone book.
You come and see me anytime you want.
And bring that baby.
(TRUCK BACKFIRES)
Excuse me.
Would you like a picture of your baby?
I'm not... I mean, I'm still...
Well, I mean, after.
- Oh.
- Of course.
What kind of camera is that?
This is a Rollei. There are not many
made like this here.
It's a beauty.
My name is Moses. Moses Whitecotton.
Novalee Nation.
That's a good, strong name.
A name's important. Have you
picked out a name for your baby yet?
Well, I was thinking
about "Wendi" with an "I."
Oh, don't you dare. Give that baby
a name that means something.
A good, sturdy name.
Here.
I'm here the first Friday
of every month, 12 to 6.
Take care.
And remember...
...give that baby a name
that means something.
I will, I promise.

Somebody stole my wallet last night
right out my damn hotel room.

Maybe I will.
Maybe you'll get yourself
a nice big sunrise.

Shit.
Two hundred and eighteen dollars

I'm looking for a book.
FORNEY:
What kind of book?
About... About trees.
FORNEY:
Trees?
Yeah.
You know.
Forestry, environment?
What do you want to know about trees?
NOVALEE: A few weeks ago,
somebody gave me a buckeye tree.
Buckeye:
Horse chestnut,
belongs to the genus Aesculus...
...of the family Hippocastanaceae.
I think it's dying, my tree.
I could show it to the people who gave
it to me, but I'm embarrassed.
Here, look up buckeye in the index.
The what?
I'll start slower.
These are books. Are you with me?
- Hey.
- Here.
There. See, read.
"Leaf rot, root damage, ni...
Nitrogen def... def...

- Deficiency, keep reading.
Also a book...
(GLASS BREAKS)

I don't know how I made that mistake.
You don't look like Ruth Ann.
It's good to see you again,
you come right in.
I want you to meet my gentleman,
Mr. Sprock.
- Mr. Sprock? Mr. Sprock.
- Hm?
Oh, howdy do?
Buttermilk?
Dear Lord, we pray
that you will bless...
...this food to the nourishment
of our bodies.
And we pray, Lord,
for a safe delivery...
...and a healthy child
for our new friend.
And we ask forgiveness, Lord,
for the fornication...
...that Mr. Sprock and me have
committed again this afternoon.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
I'll come by every day
to take care of it.
Oh, good.
- Lf it's a bother...
- No, darling.
I meant that it's good
you'll be by every day.
Why, we'd sure be glad to see you.
Oh.
I don't know what kind of people you're
with that won't let you plant a tree.
Well, they're...
What'll happen
when you have your baby?
I'm not sure.
Let me help you there, Mr. Sprock.
Hey Rosita, how are you doing today?
Good.
The book in the library said the
highest spot is the best place.
Oh, you must have met Forney.
Who?
(MR. SPROCK WHEEZES)
You all right, Mr. Sprock?
Oh, I'm fine. A little emphysema.
Nothing serious.
Oh, you know, he makes that noise
whenever he exerts himself.
Who's thorny?
Forney. Forney Hall.
Brilliant man, lives in the library.
- Brilliant.
- There's no telling...

if he'd finished school.
Why didn't he?

I'm Lexie, Lexie Coop.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Where'd these flowers come from?
All over. You're a big celebrity.
There are reporters here. Lean up.
See?
TV! They've been here all night.
- What for?
- For you.
They want to talk to you.
Me?
Everybody wants to talk to
the mom of the Wal-Mart baby.
Are they gonna arrest me?
What for?
For living in the Wal-Mart.
Arrest you?
Is the hospital gonna keep my baby?
Where is she?
Why would they keep your baby?
Because I can't pay.
It's like a restaurant...
...when you can't pay,
you wash dishes.
I don't know what they'll make me do.
No. No.
I'm broke. I got nothing.
I have no family, no job...
Now I got a baby.
I know what you need.
Yes, you're okay.
Look who we're going to see.
Say, "It's about time."
Does that help?
(CRIES)
Oh. Oh, yeah.
How can you love someone
so much you just met?
Forney's okay too.
The doctor stitched him up
and sent him home.
- Forney?
- Mm-hm.
- The library guy?
- Yeah.
What happened to him?
He jumped through a plate-glass window
to deliver your baby.
That was him?
So. What are you going to name her?
Oh, that's right.
LEXIE: How the hell did you come up
with a name like "Americus"?
NOVALEE: I wanted her to have a strong
name that stood for something.
(AMERICUS CRIES)
I shouldn't talk, I named
my kids after snack foods.
- Brownie, Praline, Cherry, Baby Ruth.
- You got four?
- Yep.
- You aren't old enough.
I started when I was 15,
and I just couldn't stop.
I wanted to find the first one a dad,
but I got another baby.
I wanted to find them both a daddy
and so on and so on.
I think I'm going about this
the wrong way.
Hey, there she is.
That's the Wal-Mart mommy!
Now, how long were you living
in the Wal-Mart?
Uh...
SiX weeks.
And what was it like?
You know.
Have you spoken to the father?
If I was you, I'd rule out
a career in broadcasting.
Why would anyone write anything
so hurtful?
What does it say?
"A baby born out of holy wedlock...
...is an abomination
in the eyes of God."
- My baby is not an abomination.
- Screw them.
"Midnight, Mississippi."
Oh, my.
This one's sad.
"I gave birth to a baby
in the back of a VW van...
...where I lived for a year.
My baby didn't make it.
I hope yours does.
I don't have much else to offer
but I know money might help...
...so I enclosed $ 10."
Do you believe that?
"Duda, Texas."
"I would send money,
but I don't have any.
What I can offer you is a good home."
Send her the $ 10.
Lexie, one of your kids is calling.
Which one?
I don't know.
Pez, Twinkie, one of them.
LEXIE:
I'll be right back.
LIL: Novalee in there?
LEXIE: Yes.
Well, I hope you don't think this
kid's gonna call me "Grandma."
I'm sorry, but visiting hours...
Are when?
- Right now.
- Yes.
Mama?
I thought you'd be surprised.
How'd you know I was here?
There you are.
I saw your fabulous interview
on the television...
...and I hopped right in the car,
and here I am.
I must have been in that damn
car 10 hours, I'm telling you.
From where?
New Orleans.
I been living there about...
I guess I been living there about two,
three years now.
- With Fred?
- Who?
Fred. The umpire.
(COUGHS)
That shithead? Oh, my God!
Jesus! What in God's name
made you think of him?
Because he was the reason you left.
Left what?
Me.
Aw, geez, now. Sweetie, look.
That's water under the bridge.
I didn't drive 10 hours
to reminisce with you.
- Why did you come?
- I thought you needed help.
You didn't look too good up there.
Living in the Wal-Mart is not
my idea of a big success.
How are you gonna help?
I don't know.
- You got a man?
- No.
This isn't one of them artificial
spermination things?
No.
Then where is the prick
who put you in this mess?
California.
Well, that figures. All the pricks,
they move to California.
They ought to call it
"Prick-a-fornia."
Got a place to live?
Sweetie, you are going to need
a place to take this baby.
Maybe you should think about moving
into Sears, or Kmart is really nice.
Did you come here to make fun of me?
God, no.
Jesus!
I didn't.
I wanted...
...to help my child with her child,
is all.
You want me to go?
No.
All right, then.
- When are they letting you out?
- Tomorrow.
Well, I'm not in any hurry to move on.
Maybe I could find a place.
You and me and the baby.
You mean like a home?
Home, apartment, whatever,
until you get on your feet.
I got me a little money.
Oh, I got money. The president
of Wal-Mart sent me $500.
Why?
He's not the father, is he?
- No.
- Oh, shit.
No, he just wanted to be nice.
They offered me a new job in any
Wal-Mart in the country.
Wow.
So...
I'm thinking...
...what with your money
and my money together...
...we might find a real decent place.
I don't want you to worry
about anything anymore...
...because Mama Lil is here now.
Why don't you come by
and pick us up tomorrow? 9 a. M?
On the dot.
I got a lot of stuff to do.
We gotta get diapers,
and blankets, and a cradle...
- Mama?
- Yeah?
Thank you for coming.
You bet.
(AMERICUS CRIES)
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
Shh. Okay.
You should try to call
whoever is coming.
I don't know where she is.
I could call a cab for you.
Where are you going?
(AMERICUS CRIES)
Five hundred dollars,
I should have known.

Hey.
Well, look at all this.
And look at you.
Oh, yes, you're just as cute today
as you were yesterday.
Maybe cuter.
Well...
You know that tree?
Your tree that you planted in my yard?
I'm trying to take care of it.
I don't have the feel for it.
I don't have the time either.
I thought that maybe if you and the
baby came with me for a while...
...you could take care of it for me.
It'd sure help me out a lot.
Okay.

Here. Here you go.
- Hello.
- Here you go.
- Who's a good girl?
- Yes.
I got her.
Yes?
Ma'am, we have come to bring the word
of God to the Wal-Mart baby...
...and to her young, unmarried mama.
We drove all the way up
from Midnight, Mississippi.
Well, you folks could have saved
yourself a trip...
...because the word of God has been
in this house a long time.
I thought that was over and done...
...people wanting to see
the Wal-Mart baby.
Bye, sweetie.
Mama will be back.
- Bye, Mr. Sprock.
- I made links.

you won't be pregnant.

and then I had twins.

Why's that?
Well, he's sterile as a cotton ball.
- So it's permanent?
- He had mumps when he was 15...
...and they went down on him.
Down where?
To his manly areas.
So they're...?
Oh, God, Novalee, no.

- Hard for me, anyway.

- Something wrong?
- Is there a ladies' room?
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

Yes! Thank you, Lord!
Thank you so much!

You bet!
Oh, I've gotta go.
- Got a big date or something?
- No.
Oh, because I thought you were
sort of seeing somebody...
No, that's done. That's finished.
I'm done with guys like that.
Like what?
You know, good-Iooking, cocky...
...and look great in some tight jeans
and a white T-shirt.

to meet my sister.
This is Mary Elizabeth Hall.
She's the librarian.
Mary Elizabeth's a lot older than me.
I was still a kid
when she started drinking.
Oh, you're underselling that. Yeah.
I was 10 the first
time my father put her away.
Away? Where?
In a sanitorium back East.
So, what exactly are you looking for?
I'm looking for a gift for Sister
and Mr. Sprock.
- It's their anniversary.
- Anniversary?
Yeah, they've been "close"
for six years.
I was back East at college and...
- College?
- I was studying to be a teacher.
My dad died and my sister
couldn't be left alone.
She begged me not to send her away,
and said she'd kill herself if I did.
That was nine years ago.
So, what are you thinking?
Candlestick holders? Picture frame?
Good God. Who would buy
somebody else's toupee?
Oh, my gosh. Look at this.
It needs a little cleaning, is all.
Hey, Moses, you want to hear
something funny?
I wouldn't mind.
Well, I was thinking that someday...
I mean, a long time from now,
I could...
...maybe be a photographer.
That's not funny.
It's not?

Not a live one.
- You have one of those aluminum ones?
- No.
Those cost money.
No, when I was 8,
I was living with this old lady.
She promised me we'd have
a Christmas tree.
And then she went
and spent all her money...
...on a set of bagpipes because...
Well, I guess she was just insane.
But she felt bad.

she found some green paint...
...and she painted a Christmas tree

- Hi.

- Everybody say "hi."

- How do you feel?
- Ha! Mumps?
I got his mumps right here.
Go find us a good-Iooking Christmas
tree that doesn't cost more than $40.
Have you heard from him?
You mean since he stole my brand-new
pillows and left town on his Harley?
I guess that's what I meant.
You want us to wait
and give you a ride?
No. You never know, maybe I can get
knocked up again on the way home.

- Merry Christmas.

steal a woman's pillows?
Because he could, I guess.

sees this tree.
Don't expect too much of a reaction.

- Hey, you know what?
- What?
Americus is exactly
five months old today.
- What?
- Yeah, she was born July fifth.
SISTER: Novalee!
NOVALEE: What happened?
I turned around and she's gone.
- What happened?
- She's gone! Americus is gone.
The front door was unlocked?
I went to the shed for decorations.
I was two minutes.
Is anything else missing? Money?
Is there anyone who might've
taken your daughter?
Anyone who is mad at you?
There's a woman at work.
She says I park in her space, even
though we don't have regular spaces.
But she wouldn't take Americus.

Anyone have a grudge against you?
- Like who?
- Someone at the AA?

We're alcoholics. We're generally
