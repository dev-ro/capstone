Father.
Father.
What's up?
We've heard a lot
about your goats.
It is said that their milk
is sweeter than nectar.
Won't you offer us
your goats' milk?
Go get the milk.
Good.
So the rumor is not false.
It is true.
Really.
Your goat's milk is
sweeter than honey.
They call me Nanhe Singh.
Have you heard my name?
Tell him about me.
He is a politician from
the Delhi government.
Yes!
A politician from Delhi
and do you know the Salwa Judum
of our district?
It is under my jurisdiction.
Understood?
At least, now offer me a seat?
Yours?
How many?
And how many kids?
Only two.
- Only two?
You are one of those
family planning types.
Does he look like a tribesman?
If I put these glasses on you..
Here, wear them and show me.
Look.
Doesn't he look like
Rajesh Khanna?
Now I know why your
goat's milk is so sweet.
Tell me.
Do you know what Salma Judam is?
It is a public movement
to save you, your wife
your children
from the Naxalites.
And they say
you denied going to the camps?
Do you want to die here?
You will be safe
in government camps.
If you stay here,
the Naxalites will kill you.
Come with us.
I can't leave the temple.
For 5,000 years,
the lamp has been burning.
Bull crap. 5,000 years?
Do you even know when
our country got independence?
Have you ever sat in a train?
Do you know
where Ram temple is?
Moron! 5,000 years!
Do you understand
what am I saying?
Where is your eldest son?
Moron! Family Planning?
Tell me.
Do I look like a moron to you?
A boy for you and
a girl for me!
Where is your eldest son?
Where is he?
Woman, get some water.
He is with the Naxalites,
isn't he?
Pour here.
Do it properly.
Come on get up. Get up.
Wear them.
Now you decide
whether you want to be with
children of Mother India
or be with enemies
of our motherland.
India is your mother,
you moron.
These Naxalites are
raping your mother.
See.
We'll try to save your son.
We can get him out of it.
Like you, he can also live with
dignity in the government camp.
You just have to put
your thumb impression here.
This will verify that
you are with Salwa Judum.
See the others have
also done the same.
Give me the ink pad.
Hurry up, man.
Take it.
Here, come on.
Come on. Do it, man.
You won't do it?
Moron. Naxalite. Rascal.
What do you want?
You want me to force your son
to rape your daughter
and wife in front of you.
Do it!
Move!
Father.
Should we go to the camp?
I don't know.
How many more days
will you worship?
We have left our homes,
our parents, our kids for you.
And you.
You want to go in
that government camp?
And join those
Salwa Judum rascals?
With the government
which is making
a mockery of our nation
for past 60 years?
Nanhe Singh is a beggar.
If this beggar becomes
a minister
he will become a bandit.
His hunger will
never be sated.
The filthy pig will devour all.
Do you know what happens
in these camps?
Do you?
The doctors perform
vasectomy in these camps.
They cut your veins,
castrate you.
You know what they do?
Turn you impotent!
Like the race horses
are neutered so that
they can gallop faster.
Similarly they
will remove your testicles.
Make you a eunuch
and a slave in your own farm.
Now you tell me.
What do you want to do?
Do you want to fight?
Or you want to die?
If you want to die
then die fighting.
Like your son.
You have become a traitor
to your own community.
They forcibly took
my thumb impression.
There you see.
This is the dirty
politics they play.
The British forcibly
took our thumb impressions
and made us slaves.
These moron are
using the same strategy.
Now you tell me.
What will you do now?
I will betray the government!
Shut up!
- Father.
Father.
You are not
betraying government.
You are betraying
our community.
Mother India... rat's tushy.
You are already a eunuch!
You coward!
If he stays with you
he will also become
a coward like you.
He will fight with us!
He will come with us.
Fight along with us.
So the Naxalite put
a gun to your head
took away your son
and you didn't do anything?
Now see another spectacle
from these glasses you wear.
And don't utter a word.
Father.
Father.
Everyone listen carefully.
Whoever...
Whoever supports the Naxalites
will meet the same fate.
Get me some water.
"You strip us,
yet you are not sated."
"It's your psyche
that is naked."
"I can also rip your flesh apart
if given the power of wrath."
"Why the powerful
won't deliver justice?"
"Why the only drive in this
world is greed and injustice?"
"In this ever changing world."
"Life goes on,
in orderly chaos."
"Life goes on,
in orderly chaos."
"Life drifts on, steadily
as a boat in the river stream."
"As my bleeding soul
sings like a black bee."
"Why the powerful
won't deliver justice?"
"Why the only drive in this
world is greed and injustice?"
"In this ever changing world."
And I'm gonna get high.
Oh, you!
- Have some more.
Good job, babes.
Good show.
Hi, baby.
- Hey, sweetheart.
Guys, are we seeing
any film today?
I watched 'The Social Network',
so no more movie this week.
What a movie! Brilliant!
It wasn't that brilliant!
- Buzz off, pal!
How sweet! You thought
it was a true story, Shibu?
It's a lie,
you know that, right?
It's all manufactured.
And as far as I'm concerned
your film should've been called
'The Anti-Social
Freaking Network'.
Of course! - Anti-Social
Network. What the hell!
What do you do on Facebook?
You go home. You sit alone
and you poke people.
And who are your friends?
And what do people do
on Facebook?
They farm, they gamble
and they become gangsters.
Is this social networking?
Twitter! Is what you call
innovation. Steroid blogging.
Now that I get!
Vikram! Chill!
Facebook and Twitter are
like apples and oranges.
Both are different,
but both are awesome, dude.
Oh honey!
It's like saying
a shag and a blowjob are both
different and both are nice.
Ask any guy
he'll tell you what's better.
- I prefer both.
Of course, you freaking do.
And you know guys,
according to a survey
Twitter posts are complete
nonsense and pointless.
Where did you read this?
On Twitter.
- No, you didn't!
I did!
- Damn you!
Bet on this.
- How much?
Guys. Guys, I want to get this
tattoo done on my back. See.
Sorry. Here!
That is so pretty.
See.
These dragons, eagles,
tigers, cats, bats.
Why do potheads
get animals tattooed?
Because my love
humans are slowly
turning into animals.
Okay, guys, I have a theory!
Oh my God!
For example.
The world probably began with
a hundred people
and a hundred souls.
- Right.
These hundreds
turned into thousands
thousands into millions
millions to billions.
So humans are
constantly increasing.
Babies are born every day.
Population is multiplying
but a soul is neither born
nor can it die.
So then...
So where do all these humans
get their souls from?
From where?
Animals.
Today is the day...
Why do you think..
- Ladies and gentlemen
Pooja Reddy, you have broken
the sound barrier
and spoken the stupidest..
- Why do you think..
You've realized.. - Why do you
think people are turning into
pigs, rats, vultures, dogs?
Etcetera. Understand?
- Listen, listen.
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
Pal, did you realize?
Why you behave like
an ass all the time?
So what are you?
You are also a wicked soul.
Which animal lives
inside you?
Look guys. It's confirmed he is
hundred percent donkey reborn.
No, guys.
Vikram is not a donkey reborn.
He is a cock reborn.
I will just... wait.
Aw!
And we can all call him
Prick Reborn.
You know what you are?
What the hell, man!
Look at this!
I am...
a witch.
I am a witch.
I am a witch.
A born again witch.
I am loud,
I am proud I am bad.
Here goes my baby.
"I am a witch."
"A born again witch."
"A born again witch,
just a born again witch."
"I am a witch. I am a witch."
"I'm loud, I'm proud, I'm bad."
"I am bad, I am mad
and my papa is so rich."
"Take me home, baby!"
"I am a witch."
"I am a witch."
"A born again witch,
just a born again witch."
"I am a witch. I am a witch."
"I'm loud, I'm proud, I'm bad."
"I am bad, I am mad
and my papa is so rich."
"I am.. I am a witch."
Should I cast her as
Juliet in our play?
Juliet was a virgin.
"A born again witch
just a born again witch."
Hey Pooja!
I am a witch, I am a witch,
just a born again witch."
Come down!
Pooja, come down!
From now on, no girls should
be seen dancing in bars.
If you want to live in India,
live as Indians.
We won't let India
turn into America.
Long live India.
Long live India.
Long live India.
Pink Bra Campaign.
Interesting concept, right.
Yeah, these rascals should
really be set straight.
Take a look, this is awesome.
- Yeah! I know this.
Oh, wow.
- Pink..
Hey!
Good job done!
- Wow! Awesome.
Cheers!
Good job.
Okay, guys.
Okay.
- Oh!
Come here, come here.
Come here. Come up here.
I am the profile picture.
Damn those Rascals!
Yeah, damn those rascals!
Corruption is the much
needed grease
for the squeaking tires of
a rigid administration.
Who said that?
Okay! You tell me.
- Sir, Huntington.
Absolutely right!
So that's why I say
corruption is good.
Sounds weird, isn't it?
Okay! Let me explain it to you.
Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai.
These are four major
metro cities of our country.
Here the traffic never stops
and we know the
conditions of our roads.
And the Indian traffic sense is
world famous.
Yet people manage to reach
their homes and offices.
How?
The traffic countable standing
in the middle of the road
managing traffic is solely
responsible for turning
this impossibility
into a possible situation.
Since the government
pays him a meager salary
he has no other option but
to report on duty every morning.
Because when he goes to work,
he will get bribes
and that is the only way he can
manage his family expenses.
Now like that traffic constable
ticket collectors,
municipal workers
state electricity board workers
and everyone working in
the whole political system
the only reason for them, to
work or not to work is the same
and that is bribes.
Yes... - Sir, if graft was
so good then it would
benefit the rich and
the poor equally.
But it doesn't.
Corruption is an economic
stimulant.
A catalyst for growth.
For the economy
corruption is like tonic!
Yeah.
I am sorry, sir, don't you think
it's time to change this tonic?
I mean that's ridiculous.
So how do you propose
to do that, Mr. Vikram Pandit?
By starting a Pink Bra
Campaign on Facebook?
Why not? - Because you can deal
with local issues
by creating a social media
campaign.
But can you change
a corrupt system
with social media?
Perhaps no!
No, sir I mean.. Er..
the revolution in Egypt.
That was started on
social media.
Okay!
Then the Kashmir issue can
also be solved on social media?
We can solve the Naxal
problem on social media?
The tribal could also get
their long awaited justice
through social media?
But that does not happen,
Mr. Vikram Pandit.
Sir, I don't know if I can
get justice for the tribal.
But I can certainly raise
a voice for their rights.
That's a start.
Okay.
I'll see you in my office.
That's all for today.
Thank you.
Lunch.
While speaking
with the correspondent
The greatest weakness
of a tribal is
that he is not corrupt.
He has no part to play
in this nexus of graft.
And unfortunately neither of
us can do anything about it.
You mean the tribal won't
progress until he is corrupted?
That's the logic!
You are my student.
I did not want to you
to make feel small
in front of the
whole class.
Especially after what...
what's that Pink Bra Hero..
This social justice,
socialism are mere words.
Socialism has no future today.
It's a..
It's a hopeless situation!
I'm sorry, sir
in a country where
70 percent people are poor
and only a few thousands
have money
socialism can't be
just a word.
I mean, I am convinced it could
be the hottest trending issue.
Yeah! Hottest trending issue!
Okay Mr. Pandit,
if you are so confident
let's play a game.
Reliable source claim that
the government has
decided to deploy
over 150 CRPF battalions..
One second, one second, please.
in the remote parts
of the affected area.
Hello, papa!
Did you listen to BBC?
Yeah, tune in to listen.
I will call you in a while.
I'll call you later.
Papa, bye! Bye!
The earlier
government had discussed
using Air force to fight
against the terror,
it is yet to be seen..
What game, sir?
The game? - Okay.
Yeah, yeah! A secret game!
Take this file.
It has my notes.
Articles, essays on
social revolution.
How old are you?
- 27, sir.
I was 21 years old
when I wrote this.
It's useless for me now.
You are the hero
of social media.
Publish it on social media.
Blog it!
But under your name.
Because in 2014 only
a handful remain
who listen and think
about socialistic theories.
You will understand
the difference
between tribal issues
and Pink Bra.
Try it!
Okay.
Yes, papa!
I was about to call you up.
Did you hear it?
Hey! Hi.
- Hey.
Yeah, tell me, Vikram.
When is the next student
body meeting?
Next Student body meeting is...
On Saturday. Why?
- Okay.
Can you book me a slot?
- Okay.
Let me know the time.
What?
You need a time slot?
- No.. I want to speak.
You want to speak!
Are you serious?
Yes! I want to speak!
It's not that funny!
I know, guys.
Ever since I can
remember myself.
My answer to a no has
always been a yes.
If everybody here wanted beer
I'd want rum.
If all of you wanted to have rum
I'd want beer!
I am pretty sure
I was born prematurely
because my mother was
not quite ready for me yet.
When my girlfriend wanted
a tattoo on her left breast
she ended up with
one on her right.
When she wants to be on
top of me
she ends up under me.
It was such a big deal for me
that I didn't realize
when I started doing exactly
what other people wanted
because they had figured me out!
I am just this quirky screw-up
that has this stupid
predictable habit.
But because of it, one thing
I positively understand is
that when people
know what your weakness is
they can manipulate you at will.
Now it's a big mystery.
Whether the government
of Pakistan
manipulates the terrorists
or whether
the terrorists manipulate
the government of Pakistan.
In either way
Kashmir is paying the price!
Everyone gets a piece
of the pie.
Employment for unemployed youth.
Business for the arms and
ammunition dealers,
winning elections.
ISI's enormous budget
gets justified.
The president of Pakistan
be he elected or otherwise
gets a very convenient truth
to fool his own people and
to fool the powers of the west.
Everyone gets a piece
of the pie!
Except for the
people of Kashmir.
Be he the Pandit,
be it the mullah.
He has nothing in it now.
He will have nothing in it later
and he is paying the price.
And this is something we
as Indians understand very well.
And so we scream slogans like:
Victory to Mother India!
Hail motherland!
So patriotic!
Now simply replace
the Government of Pakistan
with government of India.
The terrorists with the Maoists
and the Kashmiris with
the tribals.
I'm not saying I am a Naxal
or a Leftist or a Maoist.
Please!
I am just a quirky screw-up!
Not bad!
In two hours,
more than hundred hits!
Nope! 136 to be precise.
It's true that we need support
from outside the border.
We need help.
You know we need friends.
We need guns,
we need ammunition.
And in this war, because
this is gonna be a new war
the guns have got
to be our minds
and the ammunition
are our thoughts.
And we have this enemy
that's inside our country.
The biggest enemy
are the people who are
in the government offices
they are in the parliament.
They are in all the institutions
running this country.
That's right
That's who we need to
fight against, you know!
Thanks.
What we actually need
is to raise a storm.
You know, a tornado!
An army of incorruptible
intelligent youth
to finally to take the fight
to these imperialist rascals
and bring them down.
I mean what
we need is to strike.
We need a revolution.
Yeah.
- That's what we need.
But how, man?
- We do it by thinking it, man.
We do it by believing in it.
We do it by getting out there!
I mean you are gonna get placed
and you gonna go out there
and you're just gonna work
as a corporate drone
for 4.2 million a year
and you are never gonna look
back and think that maybe...
Maybe if you'd had tried
you'd have changed the world.
Because you can do it
but you're never gonna do it.
Because somebody is gonna
come from Infosys
or Google or somebody they gonna
give you a fat-ass pay check.
They are gonna give you
a nice crappy little house
and that's gonna be your life.
And if everyone thinks that way
then everyone becomes
a slave to the system again.
But it's just ten of us...
It's not ten of us,
it's ten of us now.
Then is the other ten.
Then it's the ten they tell
then it's the ten they tell.
How many kids of our age are
in a position to do something?
If we just freaking try.
If we just freaking believe.
It's right there!
Excuse me. Can I?
Hey!
You wrote that piece? Inside.
- I did!
Wow! How did you think about it?
- Honestly, I was doped!
Well! Maybe then even
I should try some.
I always wanted to be a writer!
Then why don't you write?
Never quite understood
what to write!
And anyway half the
people in the world
are either writers or actors.
That's true. That's true!
Going this way?
So you live in Hyderabad?
Yes, for the past six years,
I'm here. - Oh nice.
Married!
Yes, I am married!
- Why such a long pause?
Honestly?
- Honestly!
I was tempted to say no.
- Ah!
Do you have kids?
No
- You don't like kids?
No! I love kids!
Any plans to have kids?
- Not today!
Not today!
How about a drink today?
Sure, why not!
Priceless.
- So, what do you do?
As in job?
Not now, but I did earlier.
- What?
When I was in Delhi
I used to work for this
National Museum of Modern art.
- Wow!
I mean, that's a great job!
- It's a wonderful job, yeah!
So how did you come
to Hyderabad?
Had to relocate.
But enough about me already.
You tell me.
You tell me about yourself.
There is nothing much to tell.
You write so well,
you speak so well, so.
Thank you. Thank you.
Girlfriends, I am sure
you have a plenty.. - Sadly no!
Why? - Because I don't
understand this.
You tell me.
The girls that are sexy
have no substance
and the girls that have
substance are just not sexy.
And by the time they have both
they are married.
A lot...
Thank you!
Oh you know there's a...
There's a really
interesting version.
Interesting way
of reading these.
The one where you add
a word at the end of the...
Yes! Yes! You know that one.
- Yeah! Yeah!
You wanna try? Okay.
- Yeah! Sure.
Word?
- Yes.
In bed.
It's a bit cheesy I know.
- Very cheesy.
But sometimes cheesy is good.
Okay.
So...
Plan for many pleasures
ahead in bed!
See! I see girlfriends
in the future. - I hope so.
You'll find something
that you've lost in bed.
I did. My earrings.
And Vikram Pandit's
forecast is..
Nothing! It's a blank!
It's actually blank.
It's not funny.
Blank in bed.
- Vikram Pandit.
You Naxalite. Here you are
having imported beer
and you sermonize about tribals?
They are all the same.
Write a book, win an award
and start pimping
the damn Naxalites.
What book?
What gibberish are you talking?
You think the country is dumb?
Do you think we all are dumb?
What the hell!
Look..
- Oh my God!
I'll come to your institute
and shoot you.
If I see you again, I'll put you
in a grave. You ISI agent.
Then you'll know what
revolution is.
You are selling
your own country.
You will make us slaves again.
You hypocrites, rascals
educated freaking
intellectual terrorists.
What the hell..
So what do you
have to say about it?
It was game for me, sir.
The game's over.
Your file, your thoughts.
I came here for my MBA,
not to become an activist.
And you are right.
In this country,
there is no hope.
Thank you.
Vikram.
You won the game!
Thank you, sir.
"When I wake up"
"I realize that
your love's all I need."
"And heaven knows."
"That your love, that your love
has blown me away."
Vikram, this is Mr. KVS Prasad.
Additional Director General
of Police.
The man behind Greyhound.
- Greyhound as in...
Greyhound as in Greyhound dogs.
Hunting dogs.
We are paid to hunt.
It's a different thing
that they hunt humans.
Professor Batki.
All right, I'll see you.
Yeah, yeah! I am coming.
Not humans... Man-eaters.
Sorry, I am little confused.
What were you guys
talking about?
We were talking about Naxalites.
Damn traitors!
Anyway, you tell me
about yourself.
Not much. I was in IIT Delhi.
Then I went to New York.
Worked at Wall Street
for four years
then I came back for my MBA.
But tell me.
This Naxalite problem.
Why is it called a war?
And why do you
call them traitors?
How many of our soldiers died
in Kargil?
587.
And who killed them? Our enemy.
And here in my area,
I mean in Naxal area...
Do you know how many of
my men died here?
1,500 soldiers
and 4,500 civilians.
Kargil: 587.
Naxal area: 6000.
Now you tell me
where is the real war
and who is the real enemy?
Potter's Club is
Sheetal's brain child
and as a good husband sometimes
I look after the child.
Okay, Just hold on. Hello!
Hello! Sheetal! Come here!
And keep the remaining ones too.
- That is Sheetal, my wife.
Sheetal, this is Vikram
you know. The same boy.
Hi! How are you?
- Hello.
I am very well.
- Okay, you know each other.
Okay, then I will leave
you alone and be good.
Okay?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Oops!
A girl joined Sheetal
in the first year.
And now there are 58 people
with her in Potter's Club.
Professor! I need to
talk to you. It's very urgent.
Two minutes..
- One second. Yes?
The thing is...
May I have everyone's attention
please. Excuse me.
Just.. Just.. just
gather around please!
It's time now. A very, very
good afternoon to all of you.
Thanks for coming!
A bored housewife's hobby
converts into a business
and that business
turns into charity.
Nothing can describe the
birth of Potter's Club better.
So welcome to the 5th year
of the Potter's Club annual.
This year, tribal welfare
department has given us
a grant of 220 million rupees.
And it's such a
wonderful coincidence
that the Tribal Welfare
department's undersecretary
Mr. Satyadev Dubey is here
with us. Welcome, sir.
Okay.
- Well done, sir.
Wow! Keep it up!
- Good job!
Thank you!
But this year our target is
not 220 million but,
it is 250 million
which we have promised to an NGO
called the Peace Commando.
It is not just an NGO for us.
The whole and sole of this NGO
is a colleague of ours,
a very good friend of mine.
Where is she? Charu!
Charu! Come! come!
Let's give it up for
Charu Siddhu.
Come! Come on!
And now the man himself.
My husband,
Professor Ranjan Batki.
Please Ranjan!
Well, my friends I won't
take much of your time.
Thanks, sir!
Pooja, calm down.
As Sheetal just mentioned
we are still 30 million short.
So please buy our pots and
help make this charity popular.
Sir, you are doing a great job!
Don't worry about
the popularity crap.
Thanks!
Buy them as gifts
for your friends
you can contribute
to this charity.
Yeah, guys! All of you please
contribute to this charity crap!
Pooja, enough, stop it.
I think, young lady,
the wine is really very good.
But for your kind information
this Potter's Club
is no charity crap.
But now, I formally announce the
opening of Potter's Club 2014.
Cheers!
- Well done.
Well done! Congratulations!
- Thank you sir.
Sir, it's urgent.
- Okay, let's go, let's go!
Okay, please start.
Sir, I don't know
how to say this.
This is bad timing
but the government
has denied all your grants.
Denied? Denied.. but why?
Sir, the government funds
go straight
from the Potter's Club
to the NGO
that works in the
Maoist afflicted areas.
But we are IIB. What have
we got to do with Maoists?
Sir, neither IIB
nor Peace Commandos have
anything to do with it. - So?
But all the NGOs are
under the radar.
I have personally seen
the intelligence report.
Naxalites are getting
their money through the NGOs.
Everything was fine but
they blew up an entire CRPF bus.
Home Minister wanted
to get the Air Force in
but PM suggested
a better solution.
Severe their bloodline. Funding.
Just think!
Where do you get the money
for guns, bombs, AK-47s?
How are the land mines funded...
- I know all that.
Seeing you doing this
after a long time.. - Oops!
Oh crap! I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry, sorry, sorry.
No, that's okay.
Such an easy.. - I was checking
if I am still any good.
I'm sorry.
There is only one cigarette.
Anyway.
You had quit, right?
Just felt like having a drag.
Sorry, I couldn't do much
for you.
But don't worry
everything will be fine.
It's not about
the club, Ranjan!
You know I am not ambitious.
I can find happiness
in small things.
It's just that, you know,
everyone is so busy.
Everyone is contributing
as per their level
even our maid for that matter.
I've been working with
Charu and the tribals
for such a long time.
I thought even
I was contributing.
But I guess it's back to
the potter's wheel for me.
Sheetal. come what may,
the money will be arranged!
Potter's Club won't shutdown.
Trust me!
"..we drifted apart..."
Once again.
"Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?"
"Are you sorry
we drifted apart?"
Professor, please join me.
- No, not me.
You are singing beautifully!
Come on! come on! - Two lines.
"Does your memory stray"
"to a bright summer day?"
Good...
Guys! I am going home!
22.. - Pooja, you should
take admission here
life will be much simpler.
MBA! And what about GMAT?
- So good, right?
I am tension free
and having a ball.
Pooja, will you do
Juliet's role in my play?
Depends on the Romeo?
Seriously, it's the limit.
- Every time.
I mean, this is ridiculous.
200...
Well tried, sir?
Thank you. Thank you.
Sir, please sit.
- No, you sit. I am fine.
Sir, how about a beer?
- Yeah, I will have one.
Sir, I've got information.
I've got a job from Amazon.
Fantastic
- 3 million.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
And sir, Vikram Pandit
is joining Infosys
and Sudhir is picked up
by ICICI.
Fabulous! Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir!
I am so proud of all of you.
Sir, I got McKinsey!
Pretty happy with that.
He is so happy sir, that girls
will actually now talk to him.
Okay, I need to say something
very important to you.
Not that I have not been saying
for all these 3 terms.
But you see...
The country doesn't
just need successful
brilliant managers and CEOs.
But the country also needs
new innovative business ideas.
Of course. - Of course,
you know that! Of course!
I taught you that.
Let me say it's like how an
earthenware artisan would be...
Earthenware artisan?
What's that?
Earthenware artisan means
a potter the way he moulds
the clay
in the same way Industrialists
can mould a country.
It's the entrepreneur
who leads the country
into a new era
of success and growth.
The government has refused
to purchase
the Pottery Club products.
And as a test of your
keenness and sharpness
I want you guys to create
a landmark marketing plan.
The target is 250 million
and last date is 26th January.
Sir, but this is
very aggressive.
I know it's aggressive
but that's why I am
throwing this challenge
to all of you.
I am sure something
will come out of this.
Sure. Okay.
So shall I take it
that you will do that?
Yeah, we will work on it.
- Yeah?
Okay. Great!
Hi!
- Hi!
How are you?
- I am good.
I thought since you are
helping us so much
let me also help you a little.
Okay.
- Take a look!
This file contains the
names and telephone numbers
of all the business
houses and people
who understand our cause.
- Okay.
Now, how you contact them,
what you may say
how you will go about it,
is all up to you.
You can use this.
Oh, wow, that's great!
Thank you, Charu.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah! I want to know something
which only you can tell me.
In all my research
what is the nexus between the
tribals and the Naxal Maoists?
It's a very complicated issue,
but a simple answer would be
that it's a fight for the rights
and the freedom of the tribals.
Freedom?
Freedom from what?
Hunger, unemployment and the
atrocities of the government.
After 60 odd years
of independence.
Can you believe that?
Whose side are you on?
I am with the tribals.
So, are you Pro-Naxal?
Now! That is the problem!
If I am with the tribals
then it means I am Pro-Naxal
I am anti-establishment?
It's such an Urban
Elitist point of view.
I am just a middle class man
with middle class thoughts.
But I know one thing for sure
and that nobody wants
a revolution today.
You know what they want?
- What?
Money. 'Moneyism'.
Money has so much power
that it's an ideology,
a revolution in itself!
The day your tribals get rich
these Naxalites will become
their slaves.
Really?
If you've quite figured this out
then why don't you
do something about it?
Because it's not my job!
- It's not your Job.
Do you know why
the tribals don't have money?
Because everybody thinks
the same. It is not my job!
When it is nobody's job
then the ones helping them
will be labeled as traitors.
The tribals don't even get an
ounce of what they deserve.
You know why?
It's freaking nobody's job!
People are moving from Karachi
to neighboring state
for the celebration of Eid.
Cameraman- Kamin Yusuf.
Chand Nawab. Indus News.
Karachi... Shameless guy,
take another route.
People are moving from Karachi
to neighboring state
for the celebration of Eid.
What are you doing, lady?
Stop for a minute.
People are moving from Karachi
Oh, no spilled. - to neighboring
state for the celebration..
Dude, at least you stop them.
- Forget it.
Brother, you can go
from there, right?
Train will be leaving
the station soon.
People are moving
from Karachi
to neighboring state
for the celebration of Eid
With cameraman Kamin Yusuf
Chand Nawab.. You moron...
Look at him..
Karachi..
Oh, look at that speed.
Shibu! Shibu, Shibu, Shibu!
You have to watch this.
Come, come here.
Take me to Batki's home.
- Look. Hurry.
I have seen it, bro...
Batki's house.
Just move away!
Batki. It's a two minute drive
to Batki's home. Take me there.
Just move, bro!
- I need to talk to him now.
Do me a favor,
take the keys and go.
What will I do with keys, moron?
I don't know
to drive this thing!
It's your problem,
not my problem. Move!
How is it..
- Freaking, go man!
That Arab will fall on you.
- Pooja.. Come with me!
I don't want to come..
- You are driving me..
I'm not coming with you.
Not.. I'm not coming with you.
Hey..
Okay. Wait! Two minutes..
If you take more than
two minutes then I'll leave.
Your time starts now.
Coming.
Hi, sir.
- Hi, hi. Come, come!
No, sir, just wanted to
talk for two minutes.
I'm just having dinner.
Come, come.
My friend is waiting!
I'll get your friend.
- Who is it?
Hi! - Hi! Vikram.
Come. Come on in.
Okay, I will get her.
Come in. - I just... I just
wanted to talk for two minutes.
Just two... - Yeah,
come and sit. Come.
Will you have some wine?
- Ah no! No, thank you.
Please come on.
- Come on.
I don't want to disturb.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Sheetal!
Remember the girl
who embarrassed me in front
of everyone the other day.
Today she is embarrassed
to come in. Look at this girl.
Vikram, I must say that you have
a very beautiful girlfriend!
No!
- Girlfriend?
Aren't you seeing...
I didn't understand.
No, no, she's...
she's just a friend.
I mean,
I mean I love this weirdo
but I am not in love with him.
If you are not in love with him?
How is that possible?
Okay, let's put it this way.
When you are 'in love'
with someone
then you fall for
the first impression
and not the real person.
But love is just love.
It means...
Okay, it's a little
complicated. Forget it.
Okay, let me put it like this.
That I love what you said.
But I am not in love
with what you said.
That was a good one.
You got it, sir.
You deserve a kiss for that.
I get a kiss for that! Okay.
- Yeah.
Thank you! Wine for you on that.
No, I am trying to quit.
- Quit?
That's good!
After that day!
What did you want to ask?
- Yes sir, I wanted to know
yesterday you asked us
to think a marketing plan
for Potter's Club.
I did have a few ideas.
I came to ask about..
Her department...
- ...Sheetal about
the Potters Club
and the pottery.
You want to know about pottery?
It has a little clay,
some colors and labor.
Usually a pot sells
around 40 to 50 rupees.
No, no, what I really wanted to
know was.. about the business.
Like how you make the pottery.
What you position it as,
supply chains.
That's a long story.
No, it's not a long story.
Come on.
Everybody will get bored!
- It is not boring at all.
At least narrate it, in fact
when she narrated me this story
I actually got married to her.
- Come on, come on.
No, I seriously want to know.
- From the beginning.
Okay.
Since the beginning
of civilization
pottery has been
the perfect reference
in understanding
of those times.
The lifestyle,
traditions and culture
has all been depicted
in their pottery.
It's evident from
archaeological excavations.
Subsequently
as civilization spread
man started travelling
and wherever he went
he imbibed local influences
which were reflected
in his pottery.
Like, the Roman influence in
Aztec, the fusion of Chinese-art
or the Mughal art.
All this formed
a global mixture of art.
But our pots have a uniqueness.
In every pot you can see
history, folklore, a story.
Our pots are uncorrupted and
very unique and you know why?
Because the place
where they are made
the area called Bastar...
It's the remotest tribal area
where apart from these people
no one has set foot
for past 5,000 years.
That's unique.
- I'll have a glass of wine.
Yeah, please help yourself.
Right here. - Of course. Sure!
Thank you. - You remember
in the party the other day
you picked a pot and said
that it was amazing?
- Yeah.
Now, the village where
the pot is made
reaches back to time of Buddha.
But then,
what's your brand name?
Under what name do you sell it?
There is no brand name
because the government buys it.
And it's not business.
It's just charity, you know.
Charity is big business today!
Oh yes,
but you have to call it CSR.
Corporate Social Responsibility.
And don't forget you are sitting
here for past one hour
because of my charity.
I'll have one more after this.
I mean we are doing this
for a cause? Right?
For the tribals?
Your pottery is beautiful.
So what's missing?
Sir, I believe if we apply
proper solid marketing
and get a simpler,
more innovative
distribution module going
package that with the cause
that we are already selling
there'll be
a huge market for it.
But the product distribution
is very disorganized!
There are too many middlemen
and hardly any profit.
So let me say that it's.. it's
a boutique item, am I right?
Boutique item.
Okay, Vikram, where are
you from? - Ah! Indore!
Indore everybody knows.
But I am from Rourkela!
Have you heard of Rourkela?
Ranjan,
please not Rourkela again.
It's a good story
and don't worry.
I'll narrate it
in a better manner.
What better manner!
- Okay.
I'm listening!
She is listening, everybody
is listening! So Rourkela!
My father was a station
master in Rourkela.
So, obviously we lived
in a railway colony.
There was a tradition
in our colony that
Durga Pooja must be
celebrated with galore!
It was financed by the
CPM or the Janata Party.
But in 1975,
Emergency was declared
and the railway employees
went on a strike.
It was decided there would
be no celebrations
on Durga Pooja that year.
So everybody was
a little depressed.
So one day my father called me,
and said 'Son.'
'It doesn't look good that we're
not celebrating Durga Pooja.'
'Everyone looks
a little depressed'
'so why don't you just
collect money?'
So you know for 10 days
I went to everybody's house
to collect money.
And can you guess
how much I collected?
75,000 rupees. 25,000 more.
So everybody was happy.
We celebrated Durga Pooja.
What I'm trying to say is
if you are determined,
then no one can stop you.
Everything is possible.
Correct!
- Hold on.
Vikram, I must say
your ideas are very interesting.
In bed.
This is.. Take this book!
What happened? - Nothing.
Take this book.
Dean is coming on Monday.
Get your presentation
ready and
if you need any help.
I am there for you!
Thank you, sir!
- Cheers on that.
Cheers, Pooja. Pooja!
- I need some wine.
Okay, I love wine but
I am not in love with wine.
"Cool, cool breeze and a man on
a funny trip, it's freezing."
"Freezing..."
"Cool, cool breeze"
"and the fat man
is running out of breathing."
"Breathing..."
"Co... co... cold, cold heart"
"with a red nose,
struggling, amazing."
"Amazing and I say..."
"When I say I'm gonna leave, let
me be on my own. Bang! Bang!"
"When it's time to set me free,
make no scene, watch me go."
"Chilling in my dreams
and rolling in the deep"
"is close to my desire."
"Walking in the breeze
so I can be on my own."
Hello!
What is this?
Just an earthen pot!
But if I were to say to you
that this is not just a pot
but a rare piece of India's
artistic tribal heritage.
I won't be wrong.
Prof. Batki gave us
this challenge
to make the Potters Club
a financially independent
profitable venture,
free from government grants.
And while I was thinking of
this I thought of us here
at one of the finest
business schools in the world.
I thought about
the responsibility
that that education
should bring.
I thought about why despite
of booming economy
and an industrial
growth rate rivaling
any other in the world
why are we still a poor country?
Why are our villagers,
our downtrodden
our rural areas, our tribals
all not getting even
a single piece of this growth?
And then I realized
that this pot
has the potential
to change all that.
Today sir, this pot, is worth
less than a bottle of Pepsi.
Because you and I have never
looked at it the right way
and never valued it,
accordingly.
But tomorrow, say I were
to create a perception value
in the market for a 100 rupees
for this pot.
Why does the artisan who created
it get less than a rupee?
And he is supposed
to be content with this?
Where do the other 99 rupees go?
They go to the wholesalers.
They go to the retailers.
They go to the transporters.
They go to the shopkeepers.
They go to the warehouses.
They go to government offices.
They go to the octroi
and the unending list
of necessary middlemen.
What if I propose to
wipe out the middleman?
What if I make every single one
of these middlemen unnecessary?
What I propose, sir, is to
instead of selling these out
let's create an online auction!
Let's market these,
package them and sell them here!
If we create a perception
value of a 100 rupees
all we need is 10 rupees!
Just think about that!
10 rupees! To send
these anywhere in the world!
And this fellow, the artisan,
gets the remaining ninety!
I have created the application,
sir, it's ready!
I've spoken with Christie's
I've spoken with eBay,
they are ready to host us.
Sir, it's such a simple
business model.
But I think I believe
that we can bring about
a kind of economic revolution!
All we need is to click!
And let's create some pottery
and it goes live. Thank you!
It's very impressive!
Er.. Ranjan, what do you think?
Sorry, sir?
No, it was... well done!
Very good, but...
I don't think
it can be implemented, sir!
But Ranjan...
- It has..
I feel it has
political undertones.
But sir, you wanted
a profit making enterprise
that is what I've done!
I've... I've turned...
- I think..
It's not about you,
Mr. Vikram Pandit.
No, what he is trying.. - Can..
can I just finish please?
I feel...
It's very important that
we look at the prestige
of our school also, sir.
I think that's it.
It's... it's... Thank you, sir.
Good evening.
But where was the need to do it?
Come on!
- Do what?
Vikram's proposal,
why did you reject it?
Sheetal, sometimes we
need to do certain things
regardless whether
they are right or wrong.
But his proposal was brilliant
and you know it!
Everyone in the room..
Yes on paper, in theory what
Vikram said was not incorrect.
But what he was proposing
can never succeed in India!
Oh! Come on,
you are saying this.
Prof. Ranjan Batki
is saying this!
I mean you go out there
and motivate your students
to just go and change the world.
Think new ideas.
I mean, come on, Ranjan.
An out-of-work art curator
like me...
Sheetal..
- You gave my life a purpose..
I am not a chairman of a
corporate business house!
I am a professor, a teacher.
And this is not
a business house.
This is a business school.
An institution.
You can do charity here
but not business.
It could've turned
into a huge scandal.
And less financial,
more political
So just.. Just trust me!
I'll trust you. I always trust
you on everything.
So why don't you just
trust me on this also?
I will trust you because
I do not have a choice
in the matter, do I?
That's... That's not fair.
- That's enough.
I don't want be part
of this conversation.
Now don't turn it
into a domestic issue.
Damn it, man!
Vikram!
Vikram, listen!
Listen.
Listen to me.
What's wrong?
Why you are avoiding me?
You claim to be a tribal ally.
When I was proposing
progress for the tribals
why did you sit there
dumbstruck?
Why didn't speak up
in front of the dean?
You seem to know everything,
Charu Siddhu.
The great NGO worker.
A Messiah of the tribals.
You know everything about
the tribals and the Naxals.
You have given me numerous
lectures on the subject.
So why did you keep quiet before
the professor and the dean?
Try to understand.
I am neither a student
nor employee of this institute.
What could I say?
And I have no right..
- It was for the tribal rights.
Or was that not your
freaking job either?
Hypocrite!
Vikram. Vikram.
I wanna talk to you.
How dare you bypass me,
Vikram Pandit?
This is a business school!
Potter's Club is a
part of its curriculum
and you want to run it
like a corporate office?
It is and it will always
remain a charitable partnership
between the NGO,
Peace Commandos and us.
And you want to rattle
its very foundations!
Sir, I came to your home and
talked about it. Sir, I did...
Just that.. - The person
who spoke to me in my house
was a marketing student.
But the one I saw yesterday
was a political mind speaking.
I will never let your
political ambitions to succeed.
Political ambitions?
Forget it.
Forget the economic growth.
Forget your Potter's Club!
And go and join an eBay job.
Take 5 million per annum.
And have a party all your life.
- But sir...
I don't want to talk to you!
Hello, sir.
Morning, and why are
you not in your class?
Sir, just reaching.
Shibu!
What!
- Let's go.
Where?
- Just go.
Freaking!
I need to get the notes.
I will get the notes.
Damn notes!
Always on the edge.
Can you change a corrupt
system with social media?
Perhaps no.
Let's play a game.
Educated intellectual terrorist!
Kargil 587 and Naxal area 6,000!
Where is the real war?
I don't think
it can be implemented.
I feel it has
political undertones.
Okay, comrades
I hereby begin the proceeding
of this public court!
Janardhan Jha,
Depot Manager, Indian Oil!
Is accused of.. Comrade?
He has given information of land
mine on Gangapur road to CRPF.
Janardhan Jha gave
information to CRPF about
the land mines we
placed on Gangapur road.
Janardhan Jha has not
only helped our enemies
but also betrayed and
compromised fellow comrades.
Comrade! CRPF personnel
held me at gunpoint
but I only told them
about mines on Gangapur Road.
They put a gun to your head
and you spit out everything?
Comrade! My wife is ill,
I have two little kids.
How will a traitor like you
teach your kids to be
a true Maoist?
Comrade! Comrade!
Get this traitor away from me.
- Comrade!
And put a bullet here.
Spill his bloody brains out.
Comrade! Comrade!
Comrade!
- Move!
Because of this mess
I lost my pipeline!
I had paid a million for it.
Master Sahib has arrived! - "You
strip us, yet you're not sated."
Master Sahib is here! - "It's
your psyche that is naked."
Master Sahib has arrived!
"I can also rip your flesh apart
if given the power of wrath."
"The mockery called
People's Government."
"The system I resent the mockery
called People's Government."
"The show goes on.."
Red Salute!
- "...of this satire"
"It's a chaotic locomotion
arsenic in attire."
"A failed engine spews oils
from its lungs."
How did all this happen,
Comrade? That boy..
Your student.
He was under your wing.
You said he is our future.
How did he turn out
to be so weak?
Someone randomly threw a glass
of drink at him
and he just quit?
And yet you entrusted him
with such a big job! Why?
Prabhat, you could've simply
written to me about this.
Why did you call me here?
What is to be done
about Vikram Pandit?
It'll be taken care of.
Why are we meeting here?
I attended the central
committee's meeting yesterday
where I was informed that the
Potters Club auction has begun
and the money is going
directly to the tribals.
Comrade!
If the tribals get
a taste of money
what will happen
to our revolution?
What are you trying to say?
- I just want to tell you
stop Vikram or kill him.
Are you mad?
Please try to understand,
comrade.
Hello! Yes, papa!
No, I am still in class!
I forgot to write about your
letter for the pension.
I'll.. I'll write it today,
itself!
Sorry! Sorry about that.
I'll call you back.
Yeah, papa. Thank you!
What are you
trying to tell me?
Revolution will succeed by
killing a handful of policemen?
By killing a DM,
a station master
or kidnapping four school
teachers?
Or you think we will be
able to collapse the government
by hiding in jungles
like scared rabbits?
This is not 1970!
Neither is it the 80s
or the 90s!
This is 2014!
What are you trying to tell me,
Comrade Prabhat?
Just what you
have forgotten, comrade!
Oh my God!
We started this
in college together.
We had taken an oath.
You will stay in the city
and I will stay in the jungles.
But our goal will be the same.
War!
Revolution!
Nothing else has changed
in the past 30 years.
Only you have changed.
That's not true at all.
Is it? Is it?
Tell me..
- I said let me go!
I want to talk to him.
Who are they?
They are the ones. We can stay
safely hidden because of them.
Why have they come here?
They want to know when and how
Vikram Pandit will be silenced?
How does it affect them?
Because Commrade
I run the real government here.
Me, Nanhe Singh!
And the problem is
I was assured.
'Nahne Singh, 250 million is on
the way, damn the rascals.'
'250 million are on the way,
let the high command know!'
Isn't that what you said?
Isn't it?
I got 30 men out of jail.
I passed 8 tenders
in Ashok's favor
and now you tell me
there is no money?
Come on, speak up!
Has the cat caught your tongue?
Or should I get a bull dozer
and raze your
Peace Commando to the ground!
Nanhe Singh,
stay in your limits!
Or else what will you do?
You won't be able
to tolerate it. Forget it.
You witch! You blabber a lot.
Moron, talk within your limits!
Nanhe Singh!
No bullets will be fired.
There shall be no noise
until 26th January.
Here's to lesser noise. Moron!
Pimp of the government.
You dare to stop Nanhe Singh?
Shove 26th January up
a donkey's behind.
And you...
the slut of the Polit Bureau.
Professor Batki!
I have always bowed
in respect for you.
But how can I bow with
a chopped head?
I have been
a Naxalite for 10 years.
I went into politics,
but I am still with you.
Please understand my situation.
Ashok has paid for now.
But if the remaining
money is not delivered
they will not lay
the gas pipeline.
There are 23 police stations
under the DSP.
Money is needed to shut
their eyes, ears and mouth.
If the money is not delivered
then the high command
will shoot me.
I will die.
But not alone. I will take
all of you with me.
It seems that
it's not a struggle anymore.
It's business now.
Excuse me, Comrade Batki,
but we are also struggling.
Shut up! I do not want
to hear a single word.
All right then!
You stop Vikram Pandit!
Ashok is ready
to give the money.
Just need your word.
Ashok!
Give Nanhe Singh his money.
You'll get yours
on 26th January.
Let's go, Charu
- Comrade.
Charu will leave
tomorrow morning.

Tea?
Comrade Charu.
It's fine if Vikram Pandit
stops the online auction.
Otherwise you'll have to kidnap
him on Sunday evening at 7.
Any problems?
No.
Our comrades will wait
outside the school.
You will abduct him
and get him here
and make sure he has
his laptop with him.
Hmm.
I'll get him here. What's next?
Once the job is done, we'll
take care of his departure.
I can see Prof. Batki's
affection for the boy.
But you also seem to care
a lot about Vikram Pandit.
If you make even one mistake
I will rip your body apart!
"The noose is pulled."
"It's the war cry."
"Chaos all around."
"Kidnapping, molestation,
pyres were lit."
"And everyone was burnt alive."
"As an offering to God,
ill India."
"All was set on fire and burned
to a cinder. India is very ill."
Why don't you understand?
The play is still going on.
You'll have to wait.
Try to understand.
After the play is over, I'll...
They've come, comrade.
I said after the play.
Charu!
There should be no mistakes.
Does Vikram have to die?
- It's not in my hands anymore.
You can stop them, comrade.
It took me a lifetime
to reach here.
A lot of people are involved
our comrades,
government officials
school teachers, college
professors, doctors, engineers
philosophers, people
in media, in cinema.
All share the same dream.
To rewrite the history of India.
Down with these
imperialist rascals!
Mao believed in sacrifice
for the greater good
if it helped the society
and the nation
we should do that!
Now you know why
Vikram Pandit has to die!
Vikram, just run away!
My husband's going to kill you.
- What the hell!
All of them are Naxalites?
It's true.
You have to believe me.
I was...
I was just trying to help.
- I know.
He fooled me!
- He fooled everyone.
What do I do?
Anybody could be a Naxal.
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.
Are you a Naxal?
Are you a Naxal?
Is that why
you are telling me?
Are you a Naxal?
- Yes, I am.
I am a comrade and so are you!
If my husband can be a Maoist
then your father can be one too.
This librarian could
be one of them.
Your school friends.
The entire school,
people in the park
in buses, in the trains, malls
and God knows who
all may be a part of this.
Vikram, I was collecting
money for the tribals.
The same money was used
to kill them! Ranjan did this.
And I funded the killings.
They are spread across
all over India
so you have to run away, Vikram.
No, no.
- Listen!
Listen to me please.
You have to run away
before they get you.
They'll kill you, Vikram.
They'll kill you.
I know they'll kill you.
I have heard them.
- What about you?
What about you?
- Don't worry about me.
You've got your whole life
ahead of you.
Please just go away.
You don't have time.
It could be tonight.
It could be anytime.
Just run away.
Listen to me. Please go.
Vikram, wanna have a cigarette!
Who gives the hell about
the tribals!
Time to run!
Vikram, it's freaking
nobody's job!
Vikram, it's nobody's job.
I think we had an appointment?
Come on.
Tie me.
Come on. Tie my hands.
I'm not running anywhere.
Come on. Tie me up.
It has started, Charu.
It won't stop now.
"A few more days, my love.
Just a few more days."
"We are forced to live
under this oppression."
"Let's try and bear
the atrocities"
"the pain and humiliation."
"This is our inheritance,
we're helpless!"
"A few more days, my love,
just a few more days."
"Bodies are imprisoned,
emotions are bound in chains."
"Thoughts are held captive,
speech is but a slave."
"Our life resembles
a beggar's tattered cloth."
"On which patches of pain
are sewed and fraught."
"A few more days, my love,
just a few more days."
"Dusty layer of melancholy
clings to your beauty."
"As a token of our
lost brief youth."
"Cruel pangs of
a moonlit night."
"Helpless throbs of the heart"
"and mind, dejected,
the body cries."
"A few more days, my love,
just a few more days."
Professor, mission accomplished.
From now on,
Charu will take over.
Okay, sir!
All the best.
From now it's yours.
Maddy!
Red Salute!
- Red Salute!
"A few more days, my love,
just a few more days."
So in your municipal
corporations
in your electricity boards,
in your political system
in your day-to-day life
you have to grease
the squeaking
palms of the people
because we are having
a rigid administration.
That's why I say
corruption is good.
I am not sure I agree with that.
Why do you say that, Rakesh?
Sir, how can something criminal
be good for the society?
You can take example of India
and China.
Is corruption really good?
No, I don't think so.
Okay come and see me
in my office.
That's all for today.
Thank you very much.
Have a good weekend.
I'll see you.
My father.
Yes, papa?
I'll call you later.
I am in the class.
Sit.
Join me, Vikram.
Come with me.
As my soldier.
I had chosen you.
Perhaps you misunderstood
the file I gave you.
I can make you understand
something, but I can guide you.
You'll be part of
this revolution which
is against the money-minded
officers and leaders.
It is for the poor man's right
for freedom.
You know what I mean?
So let me explain to you. How?
Okay, you there?
Look around you.
Peons, clerks, officers,
teachers, doctors, lawyers
builders, traders,
collectors, DMs.
Judges, secretaries,
ministers, MLAs
MPs, police, NGO,
Prime minister
even the media, artist and
sportsmen are corrupt.
No department is spared.
And the only person
who is not corrupt is
the poor man who never got
the opportunity to be corrupt.
This is what your country,
your freedom has come to.
And this is exactly
what I'm fighting against.
Your idea was not
to eradicate poverty
but just make handful
of people rich
and this is India's
biggest problem.
You think making
a section of society rich
means reducing poverty.
That's it. That's why you
had to be stopped.
Leaders instigate riots.
One demolishes a mosque
to get votes
the other builds
a temple for it.
Who is paying for all this?
I am, you are, all the poor
Indians are paying for it.
Under this shimmering
veil of incredible India
can you not smell the
stench of a throbbing civil war?
Forty percent.
Forty percent of India is
under military control.
A war is on. It's a war!
Capitalist state versus its own
hungry deprived people
Mr. Vikram Pandit.
It's a freaking war.
Yeah, papa?
If you still haven't received
your pension, what can I do?
We live in a messed up country.
I'll talk to you later,
I'm sorry.
Revolution is the only answer.
Not just for India but also
for the rest of the world.
It's a... new world war.
This war is not between
two nations.
Nor is it for a piece
of land or for power.
This war is between
the rich and the poor.
It's a war between haves
and have-nots and now...
no one can stop it.
I...
I have a dream before I die.
The one I want to see
with my eyes before I die.
Kanpur.
Faizabad.
Delhi, Mumbai, Varanasi,
Chennai
Kolkata
and from every corner of India.
In every city millions of
comrades are marching
billions of bullets
are being fired
and the earth is bloody red
from the blood
of these traitors.
And this not a distant
dream anymore
Government of Bharat instead of
Government of India, is turning
into reality now.
Join me to create
a new mindset of a new India...
Say yes to revolution!
Why should I join
your revolution?
Why should I say yes
to your revolution?
Where is your revolution?
Where is your strength?
Where is your revolution?
What has changed? All through
your life what did you change?
How many children
have you killed?
How many innocents
have you sacrificed?
Did you change the nation?
You wanted to cover
the streets with blood.
What did you change?
I can kill you right now.
Where is your power, professor?
Where is your power?
Charu is dead.
Do you even care?
Yes?
And she didn't die for me.
Neither did she die
for your revolution.
She died for this.
Even your comrade understood
that your revolution
will change nothing.
These tribals don't
need your guns
they need business, professor.
The students will conclude the
revolution that they started.
This is the new
mindset of a new India.
No middleman.
This is revolution!
Do you still want to play
a secret game with me?
Hello, papa.
I am sorry I spoke
to you like that.
Yeah.
I... I heard BBC.
I'll hear it now.
