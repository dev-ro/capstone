Today they pass judgment
against the journalist --
and the responsible publisher
from Millennium, Mikael Blomkvist, --
who is accused
for gross slander --
of the successful financier
Hans-Erik Wennerstrt.
Blomkvist accused of Wennerstrt
Illeagal arms trafficking and fraud -
over 60 million.
The Swedes have always had
divided opinions on Blomkvist.
His supporters believe he is
the last idealistic journalist.
But now his long career as
journalistic watchdog may be over.
In the case Wennerstrt Vs. Millennium
Is defendants Mikael Blomkvist declared --
guilty in six of
eight allegations.
The accused is sentenced
three months' imprisonment --
and a compensation of 150,000
dollars to Hans-Erik Wennerstrt.
How do you see the ruling?
We must stop
people like Kalle Blomkvist --
Digging in honest peoples cases
simply because do not agree with their views.
- I have no further comment.
- There he comes.
How is it
to be declared guilty?
Will you continue as a journalist
Mikael Blomkvist?
- Cheers, everybody. God Jul
- Cheers. God Jul
- Cheers.
- How do we appeal the ruling?
We're behind you
one hundred percent, Micke.
We must do something. The advertisers
have lost confidence in us.
- We wont regain that with an appeal.
- An appeal would win us the time.
- We will not appeal.
- This is about Millennium's future.
The sooner this is over
the better for Millennium.
Not to act as the
Devil's advocate --
but it is not an idea
if Mikael left Millennium?
Just until the storm is over?.
Merry Christmas
Wait Micke.
- They are in shock.
- Only Janne dare speak the truth.
- I am a liability for the magazine.
- It's about finding a way out.
There are empty here.
I have not written a word
for several months.
Do you?

Delivers a knockout to Blomkvist
Jail!

It is rare that we show
our research for our clients.
But we have a special relationship with
your client, so we make an exception in this case.
- That we appreciate.
- I must warn you.
- Lisbeth is a special little girl.
- What do you mean by special?
But make no mistake. She is
our very best researcher.
Good morning, Lisbeth.

How do I get access to it?
You order the product.
I will deliver it.
What can you tell me
About Blomkvist?
- Everything is in the report.
- The short version.
Blomkvist got the nickname
Kalle Blomkvist --
when he solved
a bank robbery in the 80s.
A public person with no major
secrets. Read the newspaper articles.
- But then he does have secrets?
- Everyone has secrets.
How hard is he affected by the
crisis on Millennium?
- financially?
- Maybe you should read the report.
Miss Salander,
Do you have anything to add?
Do you have any thoughts of your own??
There is something odd
about the Wennerstrt case.
How so?
Is there more in the case?
I must examine him,
not do his job.
I would like to hear
your personal opinion.
Blomkvist is clean. Not one single speeding ticket.
I found nothing on him.
I do not think
he has fabricated false evidence.
Someone caught him in a trap.
Why did you not ask me?
- No lawyer could save me.
- I know. I have read the ruling.
I did not want to get you involved.
But you could have asked me.
I am your sister.
I know.
I'm stuck in the shit.
Why drag the family down with me?
And now your going to jail.
That is far out.
The secret of good meatballs is
that you have to moisten your fingers.
And then
rub your hands against each other.
Shit. could you take this for me?
- Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist.
- Hey hey, your little terrorist.
- It's Mikael.
- Mikael Blomkvist?
- Yes. Who I am talking too?
- My name is Dirch Frode.
I am a lawyer.
My client would like to speak with you.
- It is Christmas! Is it important?
- My client do not want to wait.
- Call Millennium after the New Year.
- My client does not want to wait.
- Who is your client?
- Henrik Vanger.
From The Vanger Concern?
My client would appreciate it
if you came.
It is Christmas Eve.
It has been a horrible week.
I promise
you will find it interesting.
Blomkvist!
Henrik lives on the island Hedeby,
A few kilometers from Hedestad.
The bridge here is the only connection
to the mainland.
Once everyone came from the top of
Swedish business community to this estate.
Now, its only Henrik
and the housekeeper Anna, who lives here.
Thank you for coming, Mikael.
Frodes call
was somewhat unusual.
- Are you hungry? There is lunch.
- Otherwise, thank you. Let's get down to business.
- I go home this afternoon.
- Then we skip lunch.
Do you remember her?
That is Harriet Vanger,
my brother Gottfrieds daughter.
You have met her.
The girl here?
Your father worked for me
in summer 1965.
He was a mechanical engineer in the workshop
and lived in one of our cabins.
You and your mother came to visit --
at weekends.
Harriet liked you.
You often played out there by the water.
I remember her.
- Harriet.
- I never got any children himself.
Harriet was my precious.
She was an incredibly smart girl.
I looked at her
like my own daughter.
What happened to her?
- I think she was murdered.
- Murdered?
This is family Vanger, Mikael.
My family.
22. September 1966. Thet day
the whole family gathered in this house --
to the annual meeting.
30 petty and greedy people --
who fought over who would
have the largest piece of the cake.
One of these people...
... murdered Harriet.
Harriet was 16 years.
It was Children's Day.
She had been inside the Herdestad
to see the parade on the main street.
That image
was printed in the local newspaper.
Around two she came
back to the island.
She wanted to talk to me
about something, but...
... I was busy
with a board meeting.
How was she murdered?
Nobody knows.
She just disappeared.
You are well prepared.
I have thought of that day in 40 years.
That you can call preparation.
Quarter past two, there was a serious
traffic accidents down on Hedeby Bridge.
A tanker full of gasoline
collided with a car.
Truck was across the bridge.
Tank leaked gasoline
All over the place.
Nobody could get past.
All had to stay on the island.
By accident
the photographer captured it here.
See up there at the curtain.
It is the last picture
made by Harriet.
Commissioner Morell from Hot Hedeby
led the investigation.
He took the film here and had made
Enlargements of this image.
Since then, no-one have seen her.
We waited for her at dinner,
but she never showed up.
- Hello?
- Lisbeth Salander?
- Who is it?
- Svensson from the state administration.
- You have a new guardian. Bjurman.
- I already have a guardian.
Your previous guardian was
hospitalized with a stroke, -
- so I had to
find you a new one.
Good we could meet,
though it's Christmas, Sit down.
It is a bit unfortunate --
that Palmgren has had such a lax
approach to guardianship law.
I see
you've managed your own economy.
- It has not been a problem.
- No, it probably is not.
But as your guardian
I am legally and financially responsible.
That means I get the blame if
you suddenly cannot pay rent.
I have work.
I earn my own money.
Yes, you work for
Milton Security, I see...
- What are you there?
- I make coffee and photocopies.
We do it this way:
From now on, your salary goes into
a new account, which I dispose over.
You get some pocket money every month
for personal expenses --
but all other expenses
I will have to accept. Okay?
How do you manage
your personal hygiene?
What do you mean?
With all those rings.
Don't you get inflammation in the holes?
Do you have a girlfriend?
No.
Have you ever had sexual intercourse?
I am 24 years.
I can choose to write
that you are cooperating, --
or that you create problems
and is being troublesome.
And then your life
quickly become very problematic.
So how many
have you had sex with?
- Two.
- Two?
200. No, 2000.
- 200,000. Are we finished?
- What kind of sex do you have?
Any special preferences?
Have you considered
That might just have left?
No, because of the accident.
The bridge was blocked for 24 hours.
And it was the only way off the island.
Harriet disappeared,
while no one could leave the island.
The day after we thought
that it could be a crime.
But then the bridge was open, and the killer
could have gotten rid of the body.
She may have drowned
have committed suicide.
We searched after her. We put dogs out
and divers in the water.
Even today,
when I take a walk, --
I find myself
looking for her.
When Harriet was eight,
She gave me a birthday present.
A bluebell
from 1958.
Then she gave me
a new flower every year.
1966.
The year when Harriet disappeared.
We have to go to the attic.
Incredible.
Every damn year, I get
a flower on my birthday --
from a new spot
on the world map.
- Who do you think you send them?
- Harriets murderer.
You do not know my family.
You do not know what they are capable of.
I favored Harriet. It did
her an obvious victim for them --
Those who wanted more power
in The Vanger Concern.
They wanted to crush me.
I am 82 years.
The police have since long given up.
I end up going to the grave
without knowing.
Help me
to make one last attempt.
- Why just me?
- I have followed you.
You are a good journalist. Stubborn.
I do not ask you
to solve the puzzle. Just make an attempt.
There are half a year to
you must serve your sentence.
You have devoted 40 years...
I will pay you
a good fee.
You will be wealthy.
You have nothing to lose.
You have nothing
to return to in Stockholm.
"Blomkvist resigns from the Board
and works no longer for Millennium. "
Have you written the press release
without talking to me first?
It is me
who must take the decision.
What happens now?
I will work for Henrik Vanger
in Hedeby.
Aha. So now you
work for large capitalists.
It is not for The Vanger Concern.
Are you going to live there?
In Hedeby?
Good trip.

And the rest?
You need to go on sales hunting.

- nevermind.
- You stink of beer.
- And you just showered?
You can borrow the desktop pc.
I use it for backup,
so it needs to stay here.
Welcome to Hedeby.
Very refreshing
with this cold weather.
You did not want to live in the main building,
so I hope you'll like it here.
If it gets colder,
The water pipes freeze.
Then you must come up to me
and get water.
Yes? Well, it is good.
Just put them here.
It is part of the material
I've collected over the years.
There are pictures.
Police Reports.
Newspaper. In addition
some of Harriets possessions.
It is a start.
You were a beautiful nanny.
What did you experience?
Defending Swedens purity:
We are the
Swedish national socialists -
Which the arian race
can not do without:
Family Vanger is
a pretty unpleasant bunch.
Most of us detest each other,
but are forced together by the company.
In there lives my brother Harald.
To put it mildly
we do not get along together.
Your brothers Richard and Harald
was in a Nazi group in the 30s.
Well, you know that already.
Gottfried was in the Hitler Jugend.
They were all three Nazis.
Yes. Fanatical.
Richard fell in
The Finnish Winter War.
Harald has been a bitter, old
man. He never goes outside of a door.
Harald's daughter Cecilia
Is in Scotland at the moment.
Cecilia and Harald
are not on speaking terms.
In there lives Martin, Harriet's brother.
He took over The Vanger Concern
after me.
Hello.
There you are. It is
the famous Kalle Blomkvist.
Just call me Mikael.
I am curious to hear
why you want to --
spend six months
in this godforsaken town.
Martin and Harriet's father, Gottfried, --
lived a miserable and
alcoholized live with his Isabella.
I have never seen a woman be
as bad a mother as Isabella.
I intervened
and took care of Harriet and Martin.
That was all the familie members
who live here.
On the day itself
there was even more.
Cecilia's sister Anita,
who died of cancer.
- Greger Vanger and Ulrika Vanger.
- Stop just a moment.
Who do you suspect?
None.
And everyone.
That is where you come in..
Dear diary. Today I got this
book by my dear uncle Henrik.
a nie, but busy man.
He has finally come home
from his trip and gave me this book.
I sit alone in my father's summer house
and write. Anita is coming soon.
So that is you
who pry into the familys history?
Shit you scared me!
Cecilia Vanger.
Henrik said you were here.
- Mikael Blomkvist.
- I know you from the newspapers.
- What have you there?
- Harriets bible.
She was often here
with my sister.
- Anita?
- Yes.
The last summer
before she disappeared.
- Strange, since her father died here.
- Gottfried died here?
He got really durnk and fell in the lake.
They found him the next morning.
Down at by the bridge.
This happened
years before Harriet disappeared.
Henrik said you were abroad.
I had to come home
to hide Harriets body.
We were not allowed to go here when we were small.
It was forbidden.
Thank you.
Dear diary. It is autumn.
The weather has been colder.

I do not understand why
Henrik hired you.
Me neither, to be honest.
With all due respect: There is nothing
to find. Its almost 40 years ago.
I found Harriets diary
in her father's cottage.
- Yes, but the journal did not help us.
- What with the five phone numbers?
- The phone numbers was a big mystery.
- But 32 is...
32 can be Hedenstad.
30 is Norrbyns area code.
But the names and numbers
do not match.
- Did you ring the numbers?
- We rang. Tried them backwards.
Swapped them, took numbers out.
We tried everything.
The report describes her as
introverted and religious.
Was that also your impression?
Who is not introvert
as a teenager?
But yes, she stayed for herself.
Anita, her cousin, knew her best.
Anita is Cecilia Vangers sister.
And Anita is dead.
She died many years ago.
Harriet was my first case.
I have thought about the case
every day for almost 40 years.
I retire this summer. It is
only now I can let it go.
There is no answer.
You gain nothing but
keeping Henriks obsession alive.
Drop the case
Before you become obsessed with it.
What are you working on?

Plague calling WAsP.
Hello.
- Who is this week's victim?
- No one.
Still that journalist?
I thought you were finished with him.
Why do you keep on?
Yes, it is a bit slow.
A new computer?
- Yes, I need 20,000.
- Why do you need a PC for 20.000?
- Game, surf the Internet.
- Do you surf the Internet a lot?
Do you chat?
You know, Lisbeth?
I can not just give you 20,000.
- Not just like that.
- How hard can it be?
Why can I not manage my account?
Hit again. Do it now.
That is what you want, right?
Hit me.
If there are problems with you
I will arrange for --
you are cooped up the
rest of your life.
I know all about your mental
problems and violent background.
Understand me right, Lisbeth...
I would like to give you
the 20.000.
But you know
that any trade --
is based on trust.
I have to feel that I can trust you.
Can I do that, sweetheart?
Can I trust you, Lisbeth?
Can I trust you?
If you're nice to me...
If you're nice to me
I will always be nice to you.
- It's only 7.000.
- More than enough for a computer.
What are you looking at?
You said it was the newspaper's photographer,
who took pictures of the children's parade.
Yes, both that and the traffic accident.
The old part of the archive
is very messy.
We have not scanned it electronically,
so everything is still in negative folders.
20.. 30..
... 40, 50, 60..
A photographer will take between two and ten
rolls in one day.
Closer to ten,
when we were talking about childrens Day.
Here. September 1966.
I will only need the hour,
of the procession.
- Knock yourself out.
- Is it not sorted?
If you are lucky,
they are roughly chronological.
Do you have a negative scanner
and a light table?
This is the first trace in the case
in 39 years.
It is a start.
It is more than that.
See there.
Thinking about the same as I?
What is it that caught her eye?
What is she afraid of?
Her murderer.
Aabout here
on the other side of the street --
Is Harriets murderer.
- Coffee, Mikael?
- What have you found out?
I must have read...
... several thousand pages.
People have been on the case for 40 years.
To be quite honest, --
I have not found anything.
Should you not be in Stockholm
and try to appeal your conviction?
- Leave it.
- No you leave it.
- Mikael is old enough to...
- I was lured into a trap.
One of my old classmates
gave me a tip on Wennerstr鰉s company.
It was a good story.
Good enough to trap him.
You would think.
Yes, for suddenly there was an even
better history of fraud --
and arms trade for 60 million.
Wennerstr鰉s name appeared everywhere.
So far so good.
So I wrote the story.
The all my sources dissapeared.
And all documents and evidence
proved to be fabricated.
Counterfeit?
It was too lure you
away from the real story?
It was too good to be true.
do you want something, that
is really too good to be true?
Single malt. 21 years old.
To hell with the past
mischief. Cheers to you.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
You...
Should we take one last glass of wine?
I had enough.
- Thank you for a pleasant evening.
- Because of the investigation?
My secretive family?
- What do you mean?
- It could be me. right?
I am also
on your list of suspects.
- Bjurman.
- It is Lisbeth.
- What do you want?
- I need more money.
- That we can talk about.
- I need them now.
Welcome.
Come in and take off your jacket.
- I just need my money.
- You'll get your money.
Thank you for last time.
I hope you also had a nice time.
I will not suck cock
every time I need the money.
Oh you will not?
What would you want to do then?
Should I call
to social services and say --
you're breaking into my home
and exhibits threatening behavior?
Then we see how fast you can go
back to the psychiatric hospital.
What say you?
That was better.
There you go.
Come here.
Come on.
No!
I have a... rule
you need to learn.
If you resist, then...
Are you sweet? Are you sweet now?

Do you remember whether you were in Hedeby
in September 1966?

- In 66..
- Yes, 66
- That was our honeymoon.
- How nice. Do you have pictures from it?
We camped.
It was the latest fashion.
It was our best trip together.
honeymoons often is.
- But you have some pictures?
- Yes, I have them.
Who does not store images
from their honeymoon?
On the first part of the journey
we walked in the mountains.
My husband had always walked a lot.
So it was some long walks.
He was not exactly
romantic.
Now let's see.
Hedeby...
See there.
How beautiful.
Although the image does not
do the sunset justice.
Now let's see. Here's something.
- There was a parade.
- Did you?
What the hell are you doing here?
I was on the way out.
You have misunderstood the rules. You must
agree with me when you come.
Do you hear me?
Let me go.
Do you hear me? Let me go!
Do you like being tied?
Or does it turn you on
tying others?
Super nice.
Have you chosen that yourself?
You did not chose it?
I think it is nice.
Have you seen the program in which
politicians were filmed with a hidden cameras?
We have those cameras at my work.
I had one in the bag last time.
Welcome.
I thought
I had to blow you.
But you are sicker,
than I thought.
The products a couple of hours. Think about
what the police and the media would say.
Enjoy.
Thanks for last time.
I hope you also had a good time.
I will not suck cock
every time I need the money.
Oh you will not?
What would you like to do?
Now I will tell you,
how we are doing. You nodd in response.
I dispose of my own account.
You no longer have access.
I dispose of my own money.
Is that understood?
Every month you write in a report
I behave myself exemplary.
Better than ever.
In exactly a year you apply for
getting my guardianship terminated.
There will be a mail with instructions.
You should never contact me.
If you do, I send copies of the
film to the police and all the newspapers.
The same happens
If I have an accident --
or you break my rules.
Is that understood?
I have never tried it before.
Lie still, otherwise you make a mess.

I have received a mail with a copie of

So he has been

Do you know anything about it?

No, but I have a guess --

You just sleep on.

- Who are you?
- You know that. Can I come in?

You gained illegally access into my files.

hacke your way into my computer.
If you remove that folder
I'll remove the chain.
What do you want?

- Is there coffee in the jug?
How much do you know

Until today I was not sure that
that she was murdered.
Then you showed me

- It is the main trail so far.
- And?
- I need your help.
- You will be well paid.
- I have a job.
You work

Can he have visitors?

It is good Frode.

"Between two and three o'clock

"The young woman's body was mutilate,
possibly after a religious ritual.
Police would not disclose details. "
Mutilated, possibly religious...
Was the killer found?
No. The case was never solved.
- It's a shot in the dark.
- I know.
- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- A bit too far on a motorcycle.
What are we waiting for?
- Do you want to drive?
- Why?
I have not driven
since the divorce.
Then it is about time.

What are you doing?

They could not sell the farm after the
murder. It has stood empty since then.
She was found here?
Yes. Her husband found her.
Terrible for him. Terrible.
It was here she was.
In her crib.
Curbed and beaten.
Animals were also abused?
How did you know?
"If a woman
an animal comes near...
... you must kill
both woman and animal. "
- It may be a coincidence.
- Yes.
Damn da, Lisbeth.
If the other also fits...
I have found
an old television program.
A program from 1999
about a murder in Dalarna.
"In the series' Swedish murders 'we have
come to Magda Lovisa Sj鯾erg --
from Dalarna. "
Magda...
"A cruel murder mystery, which caused
police problems in November 1954. "
- Had we not a Magda-quote?
- Leviticus, Chapter 1, verse 12
"So he cut it out
also head and suet, --
and the priest shall put it on the
wood over a fire on the altar. "
That was literally.
It was quoted word by word.
So as far as I know, they found Magdas body
after six hours.
There was a farmer
who saw the smoke from the fire.
He thought it was a party.
Someone has cut the fat from the body.
Yes, that is true. they found residues
of fat along with the head.
Discusting.
What the hell are you doing?
Relax now.
I wanted to wake you.
We are there now.
Can I come in?
Here's your bag.
Are you okay?
Yes, I am okay.
I can not find anyone
who fits BJ.
But LI can be Liv Ingvartsson.
A prostitute who disappeared in age
and showed up at a construction site.
What was the quote?
... take two doves, one for
Burn victim, the other for a sin sacrifice.
The priest clean her sins;
she's clean.
It is some way back
where we come from.
I think I have found one to.
17-year-old girl from Uppsala.
- When?
- 1964.
"The Mari murder desert the streets."
"Murderer still at large."
There.
Now we have Sara, Mari, Magda and Liv.
Four murders.
So we just have BJ,
which is circled.
Harriet did not known them.
LiV was murdered in 1949. Harriet was
born in 1950. So what's the connection?
She made a list of murders
and disappeared.
- Harriet knew who the murderer was.
- Yes.
What is it?
There have been someone.
The images are different.
Bible was in a different way.
- See for yourself.
- What the hell?
There is someone who is curious.
I buy a new lock tomorrow.
Lisbeth...
you have photographic memory?
Sorry.
I will not make you regret it.
It is great if you have it.
I wish I had it.
Shut up,
You scared me.
Whats the problem?
What are you doing?
Is this a good idea?
- Are you leaving?
- Good night.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
- I will visit Henrik. Do you wan to come along?
- I hate hospitals.
That is...
That is completely absurd.
you have found out more
than I had dared hope for.
Use your energy to get better.
I will keep you informed.
Regarding the last quote...
The last name.
- BJ.
- Ask Morell, if he can help.
Morell!
Damn to hell!
Five murders!
- It was not phone numbers.
- It was not me who discovered it.
We have not found the last BJ.
There are ring as if she is
important. It is the last quote.
Is there a woman with those initials,
who died between 1940 and 1969--
we must find her. Do you
know what this means?
If the first murders occurred in 1949--
is the man that sends
Henrik flowers old.
This limits the number
of suspects considerably.
Mikael. It is good
you could come. Welcome.
Harald could not come.
He is hunting.
- What do I owe the honor?
- Did you read the local newspaper recently?
I have been away.
They bring
a very exciting serial --
about your exile in Hedeby.
BLOMKVISTS NEW YOUNG GIRLFRIEND
- And?
- We do not like that.
Henrik is dying.
My private life has nothing to do with
My task for Henrik.
It affects everyone
in The Vanger Concern.
Have you not done enough damage? Are you going to drive
Henrik to a heart attack --
by rooting up in my daughter's death?
- Maybe you should pull out now.
- What do you mean?
You only make things worse
by coming here with your whore.
Not that tone mother.
But perhaps you should take a break.
It has been quite exhausting.
- There is a need for me.
- As your friend...
Sorry, but I have a comment.
Henrik has signed a contract.
As long as he lives,
it can not be repealed.
Whether Mikael like it or not,
he is forced to continue.
I'm sorry,
that it would be so dramatic.
- Why do you have Harriets chain on?
- What do you mean?
Harriet had it on
when she disappeared. Now you have it.
What are you saying?
Accusing me?
Where did you get it from?
I inherited it after Anita.
It has never belonged to Harriet.
Your sister Anita?
Hello, Micke.
All good?
Anita is Harriet.
It is not her.
What are you talking about?
They fit me both.
The necklace is Anitas.
Yes, this is Anitas.
Damn! they are similar.
- What do we know about Anita?
- Harriets cousin and best friend.
She had no alibi
but was not suspected.
After Harriet's death she moved
to London to study.
She quick career,
but died of cancer 37 years old.
She died 20 years ago.
She did not tell Morell,
that it was her in the window.
Perhaps to cover up the murderer.
Hey plague.
Want to check an Anita Vanger?
- Plague?
- If there is anything, then he will find it.
- What happened?
- An idiot shot me.
- Did you see who shot?
- No. Damn!
We must be really close now.
Someone does not like it.
- We must call the police.
- What can they do?
- Give me my mobile.
- Then I'll leave.
We should not draw
any hasty conclusions.
It can be a hunting accident.
If it is not a hunting accident then you
are in danger.
I think you should go home.
At least for a while.
Ever since I came here,
everyone have asked me to leave.
Is there anything new about BJ?
We found no BJ in the system.
But we continue to look.
There are two cameras out there, and four
here with motion sensors.
Great.
You do not want to go home?
No.
Do we have everything on video now?
Yes. It is already online.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- Lie down in your bed.
- I want to be close to you.
Okay, but I must sleep.
What have you experienced?
How did you turn out this way?
You know everything about me.
I do not know a shit about you.
Not a thing.
Yes, thats how it is.
- Who is it?
- It's Morell.
I found the last one.
Rebecka Jacobsson
with nicknamed Bea.
BJ.
That was why we did not find her.
"When a man or woman
have a spirit in themselves... "
"... they shall suffer death.
I will stone them. "
It is her.
- Where was she murdered?
- In Karlstad.
But it is more interesting --
she worked for Vanger
until his death in January 1965.
She was secretary
for Gottfried Vanger.
Gottfried died before Harriet
disappeared. It was not him.
But we must look at whether she was in contact
with others from the Vanger.
Wait.
Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names.
- Magda...
- Magdalena.
Mari, Maria. But liV?
Eva means liv (life). I dare bet,
that Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish.
Racist murder. This fits
with the pseudo-religious rituals.
But what about Harriet?
Harriet died, because she discovered
the connection. Why did we not see it?
It is Jewish names. There was
three Nazis in the Vanger family.
Only one was alive
when Harriet died.
Harald.
Which coincidentally was out hunting,
when you run alone in the woods.
The first murder took place there in 1949.
So Dalarna, Vilhelmina,
Uppsala, Karlstad.
If Harald has been there
He left the track.
- What do you think?
- The Vanger Concerns accounting.
- Business Travel. There is evidence.
Restaurant and hotel bills.
He has been deducted
for murder in taxes?
Yes, I know
the kind of financial men.
Even if we can prove that he has
been everywhere, it is not enough.
- Maybe he is hunting now.
- Are you proposing that we break in?
We need to go a good bit
back in time.
There we have 89.. 89..
We need
from 1949 to 1966.
Thank Henrik
for his business principles.
Otherwise, the accounts had
been destroyed.
But there they are
now it's just getting started.
Miss Salander, what did you
really find out?
Thank you, I do not need more help.
IN THE FRRERS NAME
I AWARD...
What the hell are you doing here?
Answer me!
Do not worry.
Are you now to write about me
in your cursed Communist spray?
I'm leaving now, Do not shoot.
You're breaking into my home. So I'm
in good right to shoot.
What the hell is going on here?
- Stand still!
- Release the gun, Harald.
- Release the gun now.
- Don't interfere!
Release the gun. Release it.
Are you okay?
How the hell could Gottfried get
Such a sissy for a son?
Harald...
No.
No.
- We must get Morell.
- We can call from my place.
Harald is not leaving.
Come on.
Gottfried?
Gottfried.
Uppsala 1964.
Was there a group picture?
What the hell?
That can't be true.
Blue sweater...
What the hell?
Shit.
Does that help?
- He scared me out of my wits.
- You do not joke with Harald.
Why were you in his house?
Harriet discovered a series of ritual
murders from 40s to 60s.
We know that she discovered a context
the police knew about.
We believe it was because of that
she was murdered.
But that is...
It sounds quite crazy.
We have found the link between
the dead women.
They all have Jewish names.
Yes, Harald is not exactly thrilled
of Abraham genus.
No. So I went in to see
if I could find anything.
- And?
- Yeah, whatever?
I did not find anything.
But he did not exactly behave,
like if he is innocent.
If Lisbeth can track his
doings through the accounts --
we have evidence against him.
Receipts, invoices.
She eis turning everything over.
Ok. I'll call the police.
Try Morell.
What were you doing at Haralds place?
Now now.
Cry as much as you like, Mikael.
Cry as much you can.
Do you think anyone can hear you?
We both know how it will end for you.
Why?
Why what?
- Everything is here.
- Why not?
I live out all men's dream,
I take what I want.
How many women
after the first?
That I do not know.
I have stopped counting.
There sat a girl in the cage there
as we sat and ate upstairs.
This kind of women disappear
all the time. No one miss them.
Prostitutes, immigrants.
What do you do with them?
What about the quotes? The mutilations?
It was father's project. He mixed
race and religion into his hobby.
But it was a mistake.
You should not let the bodies lie around.
I take them on a trip out into the boat,
and then I throw them into the sea.
Mikael?
Mari was my first.
64.
You were 16 years old.
It was my father, Gottfried, who showed
me how I had to strangle her.
That is sick.
It is about sex.
The killing is just
a natural consequence of the rape.
There must be no witnesses.
Although I must admit
I love to see their disappointment.
- Disappointment?
- They refuse to understand that they must die.
It is not included
In their world view.
They always think,
I will spare with them.
It is a fantastic moment --
when they realize
they do not get away.
When their eyes...
... goes out... and die.
You'll discover that yourself.
And how does it feel,
when your sister's eyes died?
- Harriet disappeared.
- I believe?
Believe what the hell you want.
I would have enjoyed to kill
her. But she disappeared.
And you will also disappear.
Want some water?
Yes.
Thank you.
There you can see.
You are like all the others.
A small, human gesture
and you get a glimmer of hope that --
I may
let you escape.
Right?
Do not worry.
It's fast.
I look forward to
your little friend.
Come and get it, dickhead.
Are you okay?
Fuck!
I can not...
I can not...
I can not move...
I can not move.
Help me.
Would you please help me?
- Where is Martin?
- He will not return.
What do you mean?
He drove to his death.
- He is done.
- Are you sure?
What the hell have you done?
He died in a car accident.
We know nothing. Okay?
Blomkvist!
- What the hell has happened here?
- Basement.
What happened there?
He died in an accident?
For fuck sake, Lisbeth.
His father trained him to murder,
when he was 16 years old.
Anyone would get sick in the head
with that upbringing.
Keep shut up with the victimization.
He nearly murdered you.
He murdered and raped,
and he enjoyed it.
He had the same chances as us.
You choose who you will be.
He was no victim. He was a
damned pig who hated women.
How did he die?
He burned to death.
- Could you have saved him?
- Yes.
- But you let him burn to death.
- Yes.
I would never have done it
Lisbeth.
But I understand why you did it.
I do not know what you have experienced.
But I was about to die
down in the cellar, --
and you saved my life.
Whatever you have seen --
you do not need to tell me.
I'm just happy,
you are here.
Thank you.
For the first time in my life
I feel old.
- We are not finished yet.
- What do you mean?
- Harriet was not a victim of Martin.
- What are you saying?
Martin did not murder Harriet.
Lisbeth?
Lisbeth?
There are two named Anita Vanger.
One dead in London.
The other lives in Australia.
First entry into the country in 1966.
Harriet?
Harriet Vanger?
Harriet Vanger?
Is everything okay?
Do we know each other?
Yes, indeed. You and your cousin
looked after me when I was little.
But I come
on behalf of Henrik Vanger.
Does he know I am alive?
Not yet.
I come to visit
Agneta Salander.
- Who, I should I say it is?
- Her daughter.
Her daughter?
Are you Agnetas daughter?
Sorry, it's just...
I have not seen you before.
Hello, mother.
Mom?
This is me. Lisbeth.
Lisbeth...
Are you Lisbeth?
I would have come
long ago.
You've changed so much.
- Do you have children?
- No.
Have you a man?
There is a...
... but you must not
fall in love.
You know that better
than anyone else.
Right, Mom?
I should have chosen
a better father to you.
Mom!
It was you who got hurt.
Mom...
Come in.
Mikael. Welcome back.
I have a good surprise. Promise me,
you do not get a heart attack.
With all the pills
I eat at the moment --
it is probably physically impossible
to have a heart attack.
Harriet?
Forgive me.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I was 14,
when dad raped me for the first time.
The year after he took me
to the cottage.
Then came Martin.
In the time after
they abused me several times.
One day I had enough.
Dad was drunk as usual.
He was quoting bible quotes and boasting
of all the women he had murdered.
I took the paddle and hit.
I hold him,
under the water till he was still.
I pushed the boat out
so it would look like an accident.
But when I turned me around...
... Martin was there.
Martin treated me worse
than Gottfried.
You sent him to boarding school
in Uppsala, --
but at the Childrens day
he came back.
I was terrified
that it would start again.
And then you went to Anita?
Anita helped me out of here.
When the bridge was opened again,
she drove me away.
I lay on the back seat
under a blanket.
I've thought of you
in all the years.
The frames with the pressed flowers
I sent --
to tell you
I was somewhere out there.
So I was sorry it when Mikael
told how you have interpreted them.
If you had not sent them,
you would not be sitting here with me now.
No.
Lisbeth, it is me again.
Call if you hear this.
I hope you are doing well.
Ring.
You have visitors.
Half an hour.
I Am glad to see you.
Here.
- What is it?
- A little reading material.
- Please sit down?
- I just wanted to give you that.
I have only one and a half months left.
