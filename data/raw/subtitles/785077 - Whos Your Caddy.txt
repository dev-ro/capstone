You have the entire
Carolina Pines Golf and Country Club

Oh, and that...

Best hole in all of golf

We did have
a successful tournament here,
the year that Jack Nicklaus

Oh, yeah, he had a good round
its only two strokes
off my course record
Did I ever tell you about that?
Just last week

What the hell are you doing

Shootin a music video
What it look like?
It looks to me like trespassing
It does look like trespassing
And you’re the one
that’s doin the trespassing
Now, get your monkey ass
off my property
Your property?
You see that line?
It represents
the property line of that estate
Now, 99 years ago your club
leased the land from the owner of record
That 99-year lease expired yesterday,
and was not renewed
One acre belonging to Carolina Pines
reverted back to the owner
of that property
Guess who closed escrow yesterday?
Whoo!
How much do you want?
Oh, it ain’t about the money
I don't wanna beat you up
on the land at all
All I want is a membership,
and I sign everything over to you
I never get that past the board
All right, girls,
were going commando style
Everybody take off your tops
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
All right, I try
I do what I...
You got a deal
Okay
Don’t play with me, though
I keep you up
way past your bedtime deal?
All right, everybody back to one
Here we go, girls
And action!
- # Yeah, yeah #
- Uh, Im sorry, Frosty
Just a slight misunderstanding
Is he a member?
No I assure you, no
I be back in three weeks
to make my final decision
Well make this our little secret,
but if I find out that this
is how you run your club, Cummings,
the only thing you’ll be hosting
is a Bud Light commercial
I like those Bud Light commercials...
funny and creat...
I’m all over it, sir
Can I go back and watch
for a little bit?
No
Everyone
Id like to introduce you
to Miss Shannon Williams
Hello Nice to meet you all
I’ve hired Miss Williams
to handle the C-Note situation
She comes highly recommended
Graduated top of her class
from Harvard,
law degree from Columbia
Miss Williams
Gentlemen,
Im not going to waste your time
He owns the property legally
and outright,
and you have
no legal recourse to get it back
Now, the way I see it
is you have two choices...
Take his offer or buy him out
- Harrington?
- Well, yes, its a complex scenario...
- Well buy him out
- Well buy him out
As you legal counsel,
I would advise against it
If I were you, Id take his offer
- Not an option
- Not an option, no
May I ask why?
Hes a... hes a rapper
Not quite our class, dear
This is not a strip club
its a golf and polo club
its gentleman’s club
Well, its gonna cost you
Throw some money at him,
Miss Williams,
and make him go away
That’s right
So what I need you to do
is call your boys,
crunch the numbers and y’all
gotta make this thing work for me
I don’t think its working
on the bill, you now
You either want to be
part of the team or you don’t
Toodles Jackass
Sorry to interrupt you, C,
but we have here a Ms Williams,
and she’s a
lawyer?
Can I interest you
in something to drink?
No, thank you
This is a business call
- Water?
- No
- Kool Aid?
- No
- Juice?
- No, thank you, Mr Hawkins
All right, cool
Have a seat
Okay
We gotta give you a hand
- Smart play
- How's that?
Sending a beautiful, voluptuous,
honey-caramel-complexioned sister here
to do battle with the big bad brother
from the streets
Mr Hawkins,
you’re hardly from the streets
You went to Dartmouth
You graduated
with a bachelor degree in business,
a minor in English lit
- Hmm
- You played lacrosse for the Big Green
Rightwing, wasn’t it?
So this gangsta rap thing cover up
that you got going
wont get any play with me
Well, either you know
how to Google real good,
or somebody done did their homework
Well, I like to know
who Im dealing with
So were dealing now
Yes, Im authorized
to settle this dispute
All I want is the membership
I don’t know nothing
about no dispute
My client was under duress
and made a rash verbal commitment
Hed like to honor his word but alter it
Oh, this ain’t about the money
I know
its about sticking it to the man
So what’s the number?
There is no number
Come on
Everybody has a price
Girl, you done brought me a gift?
Yes, we did
Three million dollars?
That’s grocery money, baby
Now, the property alone is worth
five million in a soft market
You do the math
You tryin to play me?
Im not trying to play you
I just want to settle this
So what will it take?
I want a membership,
and I wanna
stick it to the man
And the deal is done
# You know it could happen,
it don't happen#
# Till it happen, when it happen#
- # You gonna wish it never did #
- # Hey! #
That’s the 458, man
You got the 458
where the 622 should be
its stupid its stupid!
Are you sure you wont reconsider?
Well, I don’t know
You might have to tell your boss man,
sir, that I ain’t gonna change my mind
C-100!
Lookin good

So how much it cost me?
Nothing Hes not interested
in your money
This is not acceptable,
Miss Williams
I need you to kid-glove this guy,
you know, speak his language,
you know, wine and dine him
Mr Cummings, I am a lawyer,
not a street hooker
I didn’t mean to insult you,
Miss Williams
Im just up against it
Exactly what are you up against?
His lifestyle has jeopardized
our chances of hosting the US Open
The USGAs going to be here
in three weeks to make their decision,
and I need this guy gone
I will not let a low-life street thug ruin everything
I’ve worked so hard for
So give him a membership
Have you not been listening
to what I’ve been saying?
According to your bylaws,
all new members are on probation
for the first four weeks
Ah
I like where you’re heads at
If he even breaks one rule,
the slightest infraction,
Yeah, he wont last one day
And then you’ll have grounds
for dismemberment
Dismemberment
Oh I like the sound of that
I thought you would
Have a good day
Whoa, Killah Ink
Hey, Mr C
What’s happening, baby?
I have to hand it to you,
Mr Hawkins

Get in where you fit in
Money talkin, bullshitwalkin

You ready to sink this thing or what?
- Nothing but net
- Call the shot, Caddy Mack
Okay, boys, listen up
Here’s the shot
Off the ice machine, into the pole,
off the fire extinguisher,
into the ball washer,
bounce, bounce, bounce,
into the vending machine,
into the bucket
Easy like Sunday morning, baby
Now, you good, Mick-o,

If you please turn your attention
to the plasma screen
- Court TV
- Here we go
Violation number one,
rule 729-36
No personal or commercial aircrafts
may land on the course
except in case of emergency
Hold on, Ronald Reagan Jr
If you see the plasma, you see
the chopper didn’t even touch the grass
Didn’t even touch the ground, lady
Oh, yeah, oh yeah
I didn’t even see that
Can you say hovering?
Its a technicality
We are getting technical, aren't we?
Violation number two,
section E, rule 12...
What did he do now,
proper light skin?
Thirty-six, dash 12
No firearms are permitted
on the premises
No, hold up, hold up

This is signed by the mayor
The permit to carry my weapon

Oh, shoot
Sweet Jesus
Excuse me, honey
Excuse me
What does this mean?
# What does it mean? #
Hes not fit to wear
the Carolina Pines crest?
- Preach on it!
- Go on, Reverend!
Does this mean hes not the right size?
In the words of Whitney Houston,
Hell to the no!
Or is it about something else,
something more sinister?
- Holler!
- Cause this is surely not about
guns and golf carts
Tell it!
- This is not about rules and infractions
No, no, no
This here is about black and white
- Free Mandela!
- That’s what Im talkin about!
This is about rich and poor

Putter

so she came to the source
Is that right?
Im gonna whip y’all up
something to eat
Yes, maam
I gotta tell you,
I don’t understand this generation
In my day, you met somebody
You fell in love
You got married, you had babies,
none of this sleeping around
and booty calls and online sex
You kids got it all wrong
Momma, chill out
Do we gotta do this now?
Damn right, we have to do it
Look at you
You’re running
around town making millions,
shooting videos, carrying on,
but where’s the love, Christopher?
Little girl, I got your number, too
You running around town
with your big fancy law degree
and your power suits,
spending your time
in a courtroom instead of a bedroom
Your eggs aren’t getting any fresher
Sweet potato pie?
Yes, maam
This is it
Oh got pictures
Oh
Nice look
Now, that was so long ago
Okay, so tell me,
was LL more upset with you
about stealing his clothes
or his little, thin mustache?
Well, if you really want to know the truth,
it took me about six, seven months
to get this here chin together,
but LL did help me win
the talent show with that I Need Love
Pow
Im sure you did need love,
looking like that
Don’t do me like that
I’ve got a couple fashion skeletons
in my closet, too, thanks to Madonna
That must’ve been
so devastating to a girl like you
Whoo
- You’re crazy
- No, you crazy
Well
Well, you... I should be going
I guess you gotta go
Yeah, I better go
You gotta go
I gotta go

and I met Christopher Hawkins
You’re all right with me
Damn
Well, it really is
a beautiful day here at Carolina Pines,
home of the storied Carolina Cup
We’re just minutes away
from our second match of the day,
which promises to be
a real humdinger, as they say.
Hey there
Mrs Cummings
How you doing?
Are you smiling at me,
or am I smiling at you?
Now, you know there’s only one way
you’re going to win out there, right?
How's that?
Play dirty

Well, I think you done tuned
into my channel
Fellas?

That’s what we do
We’ve been trying to do that
for a long time
We do that
Is that?
Throats a little parched
Would you like a sip?
Sweet grapes
Ooh, Mrs Cummings
I can bite you
Can you?
They’re gonna kick us out of the South
This is, of course,
the 75th anniversary
of this wonderful tournament.
I'm sure every one here
is quite as excited as I am.
Good luck today, Señor Cummings
What are you doing?
I got a better offer
You’ve been playing
for me for 15 years
Where’s the loyalty?
This is all about money
Besides that, you are a prick
Yeah, now, slow down,

This is serious skunk weed
Im telling you you’re making a mistake
Hmm? You’re not gonna make it
the whole game, no you’re not
You know you’re not
Hey, who does your hair?

And now, taking the field,
put your happy, clappy hands together,
for our defending champions
for the last 15 years,
wearing their signature navy and gold
and led by Captain Richard Cummings,
please let's hear it
for team Carolina Pines.
And on the opposite side of the wall,
wearing a rather zesty orange and black,
in their first tournament here ever,
lets hear it for team Killah Ink
All right, C-Note!
# They call me Nicky-Nicky
in the streets #
What’s up, Prime Time?
Go kick my daddy’s ass!
# We should take his head off#
# We should take his head off#
# I believe there's a... #
# We should take his head off#
# I'm taking his head off#
# I'm taking his head off#
# I'm taking his head off#
Good afternoon, ladies
You don’t stand a chance
You know,
I’ve been hearing that all my life
Well, lets play some ball
And it's Magrini and Cummings
heading up the field together
towards the goal mouth.
They're 30 yards away, 20,
and Cummings is
in a wonderful position
and he shoots and scores!
# Whether it's rock and roll
or old soul #
- # It don't matter #
- Y’all stop clapping
- # Disco, Calypso, it don't matter #
- Stop clapping
- Welcome to my world
- # Suit and tie or tie-dye #
# It don't matter #
# Snakeskin’s or Timberlands,
it don't matter #
# Tight fade or long braid,
it don't matter #
# Red head or brunette #
# It don't matter #
# Break-dance, slam dance #
# It don't matter #
# Do the jerk until it hurts,
I'm tellin' you #
- # Ain't nothing wrong with that #
- I’m not your son, you suck
Oh, come on, please
No, no!
# Ain't nothing wrong with that #
- # Ain't nothing wrong with that #
- Boom, boom!
Get out there and score!
Lord have mercy
I need a horse
# Ain't nothing wrong with that #
Magrini is once again chasing the ball.
His opponents are hot in pursuit.
He reaches the goal mouth, and the goal!
The game is tied at 11 apiece,
which means we'll go to sudden death, where the next
goal wins.
That hurt my momma
Let the big dog eat, baby!
Ha!
Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Yeah
Yeah
Miss Williams,
this has got to stop
I cant take this one day more
What exactly is wrong?
Look around
The members are enjoying themselves
I don’t care
its my club
I make the decisions here
I tell them when to enjoy themselves
My recommendation
is that you let this thing go
I think that Christopher Hawkins
is a great addition to your club
Now you need to find someone else
to do your legal work
You cant quit me
I just did
You did it!
- Told you I don’t never lose, baby
One of us has to go
How you wanna handle it?
Golf match
My team wins, you go
Your team wins, I go
That’s cool,
but when I bust your ass,
you’re gonna take
that bullshit course record off the wall
You hear me?
Ridiculous! I hold the course record
Everybody knows
Who’s this? Who’s that?
Arnold Palmer
- The caddy
- Caddy?
Yeah, the caddy
that worked here for over 40 years,
a caddy you fired
because he was a better golfer
than you could ever be
His name was Robert Hawkins
Is that what this is about?
A caddy?
That was my father
You think he shot a 59, don’t you?
Caddy Mack
I played with him
the day he posted the score
If you’re calling him a liar,
you’re calling me a liar
I saw this score card 20 years ago
It is, to be kinda forgery
its as worthless today as it was then
It doesn’t matter
whether you believe it or not,
its the truth
He was the best golfer I ever saw,
professional or amateur
We will settle this
on the golf course
Im looking forward to it
its a very simple question!
Who ordered the hit?
Im just a businessman
I’ve got no beef with you
Believe it
You know, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way
Cause I love
that big body Benz back there,
and Im gonna ride tonight
Love makes a brother stupid
You don’t wanna see me stupid,
little man!
You got a big-ass mouth, bitch!
Ooh, is that all you got?
My baby sister hit harder than that
Hurry up, Tank!
Im starting to get bored with this
The more time I spend hitting you,
the lest time I spend hitting that, tater tot!
Next time bring it from the shoulder,
you big pussy!
Doh... uh yeah?
The last time Im gonna ask
Oh, its... its...
No, don’t, big boy
Save your energy
cause you gonna need it
Now, if you thought he was bad,
you ain’t messed with me
Im queen bitch of this universe
Now, if you don’t tell me
what I want to know,
after I whoop your ass...
Okay, okay, okay
I tell you what you wanna know, all right?
Mick-a-leek-a
Thought I might find you here
What’s happening, boy?
Not much
I hear you got a big match tomorrow
You should be working on your game
Oh, its too late for that
its never too late
Besides, I hear Cummings got a ringer
I got a ringer of my own, though
I need this job
No, you don’t,
not when you got C-Note
Here’s your boy I got you
- All right
- Lets do it
What the hell
Giddy-up Lets get it done
- Yeah
- Ho, hey
# Now, on your mark, get set, go #
# It's time to let it show#
# Relax your mind
and let your arms go #
# Go go go go #
# And let your arms go #
# Go go go #
# Now, I've been waitin' a long time #
# I'm patient enough #
# Been gettin' my work on#
# And now it's time to let it show#
# Time, time I let it show#
# You keep on cry in’ all night #
# You call for the sun#
# Your hair to the sky,
and that's the limit, oh, oh #
Hey, hey, hey
Hello, everyone
Top of the morning to you
What’s happening, Mr C?
Ow!

All right, let me in here, let me in here
Let the betting begin
Come on, who’s betting on the kid?
Im taking ten-to-one, five-to-one
Okay, okay,

Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming here
to this rather special contest
Let me explain
what were going to do today
Well play 18 holes of match play,

Thank you
Attaboy, Jesper!
Hit it good!

Whoo Whoo
What did I tell you?
Nice shot, Mick
Oh, this guy

Are you done?
Swing away
Watch out there!
- Boo

Damn, that waters deep
Oh
Oh
Does this smell infected?
Shoot him
Ladies and gentlemen,

and convene back at the 10th hole
Thank you
Cant we kill him?

You ain’t foolin, man
Yo, wait

Man, were getting bitch-slapped
This guys got shots in his bag
I didn’t know existed
Big deal
What are you,
a couple of pussies having a pity party?
Hes great
So what?
See, that’s your problem
You’re playing him
instead of the course
It doesn’t matter how great he is
Every time you put a peg in the turf,
you’re playing Old Man Par
Now, you’ve got two choices...
you can either play big or go home
Im going to go warm up
You know
whether you win or lose,
your father would be proud of you
He didn’t give a damn
about course records
He golfed his ball
because he loved the game
And that’s what you need to do
See, this could be the last time
you set foot on this course
Make it count
Hey
Hey, hey
What’s happening?
I wanted you to know
I don't work for Cummings anymore
So sorry
I should’ve quit sooner
That’s cool
I get it
Gotta do what you gotta do, right?
Yeah
Yeah, you think you’re working
for someone that’s honest,
then you find out later they’re not
Well, the three blind mice
could’ve solved that
Want to wish you luck on your back nine
Well, you know Im gonna shake em up
its halftime
All I have is time for the bliss, baby
Bing! Bam!
I didn’t bring you all this way
for you to... to... to
- Choke, sir?
- Choke!
Whoo!
Ladies and gentlemen,
after 17 holes, we are dead even
The winner of the next hole
takes the match
Mick, its your tee
Hey, our ticket right there
Come on, Mick!
Don’t piss like a puppy
Stay on the port
Let the big dogs eat, brother
You the man!

Ross King:
Welcome to the final round
of the US Open...
Sergio Garcia, Tiger Woods
battling it out to take the crown
and become Open Champion
over these wind-swept fairways
right here at Carolina Pines
Golf and Polo Club,
The club itself established
