[instrumental music starts]
[music ends]
Uh huh.
No, no, no. The food he ate was heavy.
But it's normal after surgery. Do not worry.
But be sure to add the medicines I gave him to his food.
Uh huh.
I understand [knocks loudly]
[whispering] Relax.
ok
No, mine came with a ball. He wants to play games.
-[man whispers] What? -No, mine is a stray dog.
[imitates dog]
OK, call me if he keeps vomiting.
Ok. Good evening.
-Sinan. -Did you call me a stray dog?
You don't stay relaxed either.
As I recall, you didn't get your last rabies vaccination.
Come on, look, we're going to be late. Come on, get ready.
-Come on my love. -Nothing will happen.
What does "nothing will happen" mean? Look, Banu will be angry. It will be said now.
-Sinan. -What?
Look, I'm done protecting myself. You know right?
-Then I think we can start working. -[laughs] Sinan, come on.
-Come on, come on, come on, come on. -What happens?
Until.
[yells] Kerem, come on.
Berk, don't stick to the iPad, don't stick to it. [game sounds coming from tablet]
Everyone will be asleep in this house in an hour, okay?
[game sounds]
[flush sound]
[Kerem] Esra, I am ready.
I am ready.
Oh finally. Take it.
Going to bed early. Grandma won't be upset, okay?
[game sounds]
-Where are you going? -For Meltem's birthday.
There was a place on the street.
-Tibet is coming too, of course. -Does such a thing ever happen?
I specifically told Meltem. "My mother hates men.
"Don't call Tibet," I said.
I hope your know-it-all attitude continues when your exam results arrive.
You will get rid of me the day I get into university. Don't worry.
You always spoil this girl, huh.
What did I do again?
-He was going out with his friends again. -I know, I have news.
It was Meltem's birthday. He asked me. "Come out, girl." I said.
I wonder why I learned about this very important event ten minutes ago?
-Because if he asks you, you won't let him. -I want his well-being because I am.
By not letting it out?
Because if he just sits at home and takes one more test
Not to that godforsaken university of some sort
-Maybe he'll go to the Bosphorus or something. Who knows? -Banu, leave that girl alone for a while.
Defne is a girl who knows very well what to do and when.
So now she's inside doing makeup for some stupid kid with acne.
[laughs] You mean Tibet?
I mean, I think he's a little goofy, but he's a good kid.
Let me, as his mother, guide him a little.
[traffic and horn sound]
-Do you think he'll like it? -What's this?
-Fatima's Hand. -What?
Hand of Fatima. In other words, it brings luck, luck and patience.
Are we in the Middle Ages, do we still have such superstitions?
How much did you pay for this?
I went shopping the other day. I saw it there.
-I said, "It's a perfect gift for Banu." -How much money?
300 lira.
How much?
300.
Wow.
But it's custom made.
[bell rings]
-Come in. -What's up?
-Good baby. From you? -Oh, it's better than us too.
-What are you doing? -It suits you very well.
-Thank you dear. Did you do? -I did.
-Stop, don't turn it off. Sinanlar is coming. -He did. Did you do?
-Huh. Here you go. -It smells so nice in here.
-[Banu] Welcome. -Health to your hands. Come, I'm in the kitchen.
Banu, your table is wonderful.
What are you doing?
What do I do? Food. Was there traffic?
Well, that's it. As always.
-What is this? -That's right.
This is actually a wonderful thing. Health to your hands.
Just eat this.
-My dear, how are you? -I'm fine honey, how about you?
-Is good. -What have you done?
All for you, I'm beautiful.
Red and white?
-Red. -White.
Isn't there any laurel?
He should stay in his room if possible.
-Hih. Teenage conversations? -Oh, how.
I hate you all.
-I hate it. -[Esra] I will say something.
-Ours will say that too, right? -Wait,
The child has just started to pee.
[Sinan] We came.
-[Text] We are in the kitchen. -[Banu] We are here.
-Hi. -[Text] Welcome.
But Kerem?
Wow, you made it spill again.
-Welcome. -My dear.
-Hello. -Chief, thank you.
A small gift. I hope it brings you luck.
-Oh, it's very beautiful. -Special edition.
I noticed.
If it is custom made, it is expensive, dear Sinan. [laughs]
Is it?
So, aren't there any Suavis?
-Exit. -No. We are waiting with excitement.
I'm really curious about this Suavi's girlfriend.
-Me too. -Sevtap.
I know that much.
What if an aunt brings one? "Dear Suavi,
-Can you pass me the salt shaker, son?" -[Sinan] Sure.
Whoop, whoop, whoop. First of all, we do not make fun of women's age.
-You know, we are considered mature now. -Gee.
-My love, you don't look 55 at all. -[Esra laughs]
-Does it show? -Ugh.
I will say something. Or maybe he should bring some feminist chick.
"I don't wear make-up. I pee standing up. My mustache is organic."
-Oh, oh, oh, oh. -Why? Are feminists ugly?
Are leftists poor?
Or just forget about it. Just don't bring that Hande.
-Don't go in there. -Yes, yes.
-Hande? -Forget about Hande.
Suavi's ex-wife. Look, look, look.
I mentioned your name, feathers are rockets. Do you see? Snake, snake.
Huh. [bell rings]
[Metin taps his hands and whispers] They came. They came. I opened.
[exciting music starts]
[footsteps]
Hi guys.
What?
Where is Sevtap?
Or "I have a bad cold." he said, we talked on the phone.
"I'm sorry, I don't feel like leaving the house." said.
[everyone] Oh!
-We were waiting for Sevtap. -Well.
What do I do? Should I go?
No dear. [laughs]
-Come on. -No dear.
Come come.
This time I bought plums and pickled peppers.
-What you brought before was not finished yet. -No way.
Tell the truth, did you have a fight?
What a fight, son. I mean sick.
Look at me, if he hits you, you're going straight to Purple Roof, okay?
What about? It says "Purple Roof". What's up Tuba?
What? They are working. Come here. [laughs]
Now, wait a minute, guys. First of all, let's clarify this issue.
How old is this sister of ours?
-Hah. -Yes.
- Oh my God, he is at our age. -How many, how many? So what?
What about Suavi, what if you find yourself a hottie like this?
If only these would crackle.
-Well, I put it to Suavi. Take this, my dear. -Thank you. While I'm gone
Apparently there was a lot of backbiting.
[Text] Well, since you didn't bring it, tell me a little bit. Tall, short, fat or skinny?
Don't you have an Instagram or photo? Show. We are dying of curiosity.
Don't bother with the guy.
The lunar eclipse will begin, come on.
-Come on Suavici, let's go first. -Where are you escaping?
No, no, no.
He literally kidnapped my wife.
His brother will learn.
[Sinan] Come here.
Well Suavi. Tell me, what is he like?
How's he like? Good person. So how can it be explained? I don't know.
When will it still be held? Stand by.
Suavi.
-[laughs] Are you happy? -Ha ha.
[sighs] I'm happy. I'm doing fine. I'm happy. I am good.
So are you in love?
Oh. Difficult question. In love...
How can a person understand that he is in love...
-Banu. -What?
-How does a person understand that he is in love? -Let me look at your eyes.
You're so in love. [laughs]
Also, if you talk on the phone for more than half an hour a day, it means you are in love.
What if we're talking for more than an hour?
-Oh no. -Then you are very much in love.
If you don't talk at all, it means you're married.
[laughs] It is.
-I wish there was Sevtap too. -[sighs] I wish.
[siren sounds in the distance]
I was getting into the quail business. You know, right?
In Izmir, the farm and everything was ready.
What happened then? Didn't the quails fly?
-We couldn't reach an agreement with the partner. Otherwise... -[Kerem's mouth is full] Huh.
If they didn't close the roof, they must have escaped from there.
Dude, you're kidding, but there's serious money in that business.
Let me tell you.
The electronic cigarette business was also stuck in customs, right?
[Sinan] Look, they prevented him. Ta...
Like that.
[laughs]
Come on, the table is ready.
[Banu] Come on.
[Esra] You had an avocado farm.
Ona ne oldu ya?
[Sinan] Avocados produce fruit in five years.
[Banu] I talked to Zeynep today.
-Greetings to everyone. -[Sinan] Say hello too.
-[Suavi] Thank you. -[Esra] How is that girl?
He has moved in with his mother for now. Let's see what he will do next.
Oh, I feel so sorry for Zeynep. Suavi, give me this.
So the thing is very dramatic. You know, he turned 40, okay?
He just said, "Oh, I've got my order." You know, "I'm comfortable."
Now you know, "I got the job done." like. One 20-pack is coming.
She's stealing her husband and she's gone.
Did you know?
[Banu] Of course they knew.
[Suavi] What will happen if we know? We don't have the mood to tell Zeynep.
-[Kerem] So. -So, aren't you friends with Zeynep?
My dear Tuba, what should we say? "Dear Zeynep, you are our friend."
"By the way, your husband Haluk sends five mails a day to a cute girl." Should we say?
-So what should we say? -Oh, no more.
These are sensitive issues. Between two people.
Then I'm telling you now.
If you hear that Sinan is up to something,
You tell me right away.
My dear Tubi≈ü, since you brought up the subject, let me tell you.
-Look, I'm saying he believes. -There's no shit this one doesn't eat.
-[Kerem] This is Don Juan. -My love, there is no such thing.
Men don't tell in real life.
So we are really very different. Like PC and Mac.
-Which one are we in this case? -Of course PC.
Cheap, slow, constantly virus-capable, one-task-at-a-time, that's the PC.
Hah, this is Kerem, friends. The ability to do one job at a time.
He can never do two things at the same time.
For example, sometimes he takes a shower. For example, I enter.
While soaping his hair, I say, "Kerem, sing a song." I say.
This is what he does. "AA!" It remains like this.
-[Sinan] How does he stay, how does he stay? - Nah, it stays like this.
How beautiful. Very good. So funny. Everyone had fun.
-It's funny, of course. -[Esra] Everyone laughed.
Wait a minute, but we, Mac women, are quick, efficient, elegant...
[men making fun]
...complicated.
Actually, tell me about Haluk. How is Haluk doing?
Well, in a loft flat in Levent,
his wife left him, his children abandoned him,
Alone with a hot 20-year-old girl.
-Oh dear, wow. -His situation is so pathetic.
I swear, it hurts inside me.
Look at me, you're making fun of me like this, but I think it's really pathetic.
What will he talk to the little girl about now?
He only runs after her from bar to bar so as not to lose her grip.
Let that be Haluk's punishment.
Idiot. He did not delete the messages.
[clears throat] So...
...I wish Zeynep hadn't read it.
-What do you say, son? -One minute, one minute, one minute.
So now is this Zeynep's fault? I did not understand. Was it Zeynep's fault?
No, of course not. I don't want to say that but...
Okay, okay. Since you eat such shit,
You know, there is no need for extra stupidity.
You don't keep messages on your phone.
-Sinan, what do you call stupidity? -[Metin laughs]
[Tuba] Forgetting the message? Cheating on his wife? What?
I'm so sorry, why do you keep coming at me?
It's like I'm the one cheating on his wife. Gee.
-[Banu] I think Sinan is right. -[Sinan] That's it.
-[Esra] Oh Banu, for God's sake. -Why?
-[Esra] What's right? -He's right, he's right.
Friends, everything we have is in this now.
So yes, we mostly use it when talking but
There are also those we keep silent. Our memories, our conversations,
our most private things.
Yes, actually, when we think about it, it's pretty much in our pocket.
There is a stranger who knows everything about us.
The stranger in my pocket. [laughs]
[everyone] Wow.
[Banu] We have pretty much a black box.
Imagine if couples looked at each other's phones
How many couples do you think will survive?
Very few couples survive. Let me tell you.
For example, Kerem never shows his phone. It doesn't show in life.
Al.
Here I showed you. Here you go.
Look, the moon is making such cool moves now, I'll see, it will happen.
-[Kerem] That's okay. -Look, his hand is shaking.
[Sinan] What was the risk? That's exactly what it was.
-You put it out there. -Here, I'm giving it to you for you to look at.
-You put it on the table too. -Kerem, don't make it longer.
I'll put it, darling, I'll put it
But don't expect such fun things from my phone.
Look, I'm counting, lots of doctor's correspondence, and a message from Kerem's sister.
-He asks about your mother. -[Kerem] Why is he asking you?
You don't answer your sister's phone.
-[whispers] She doesn't answer her sister's phone. -[Text] Pick up Burcu's phones.
[Banu] Tuba, would you answer Sinan's phone?
I swear I don't even know the password.
-1900... -[Sinan silences]
-My love, I don't know yours either. -[Banu] What about you, Metin?
What?
Would you look?
Guys, I don't think we should get into this ball at all.
I'm not saying it for myself. I'm saying it for all of us.
Whatever he keeps is on his phone. You see, look.
-Who? -[Sinan] Artist.
-Me? -You of course.
What am I going to hide?
For God's sake, what happens to my phone? It's either breast or ass.
-What more? -There is a before, there is an after.
-That's right. -Can we take it over here?
Boy, what else happens on a plastic surgeon's phone?
-Shall we take the phone here? -Get.
Now you say:
"We have no secrets. We have no secrets." Really?
Wow, I'm so impressed.
No, of course.
Where's the phone? Get. Get. I'm putting it in, take it.
I put it, here you go.
[Kerem] Will we have neither a secret nor a secret?
For example, how many years have we been together?
-For 30 years? -[Sinan] But when we say we are together...
So we spent our childhood together. So there it is, in the same house
We would watch the adventures of the German gardener.
-[women] Oh! -Everyone was hanging on the sidelines. Like that.
-[men laugh] -Oh, oh!
-Oh, but we are eating. -We are eating.
But it is. We have no secrets left. We would hang in every corner.
We were teenagers. And you can't blame us for that. Everyone was like this.
Kerem, we really don't have any secrets anymore, huh?
That's okay. I made the point.
-Yes it's done. Okay come on. -[Something comes to Banu's mind] Ah!
Friends, are you ready to play a game?
What game?
Tonight, everyone will put their phones on the table during dinner.
Whatever comes, Whatsapp, message,
speech, everyone will hear and see everyone else's.
After all, we don't have any secrets to hide, right?
It was fun. I'm in.
-My love, are you sure? -Yes.
Well, I'm in too, let me sell his mother.
More fun than that German gardener of yours.
Isn't it? Sevtap is not here anyway. You are comfortable.
-I don't understand what part of this is a game. -[Esra] Well, I didn't understand either.
-We're going to have fun. -Do any of you see the fun?
And why are you so panicked? Do you have that much to hide?
Why should I panic? I have nothing to hide.
-I do not know anymore. -I don't know if you have one.
Oh, of course.
But I don't want to find out what you're hiding in such a stupid game.
I really have so many things to hide.
That's why I insist that we play this game.
-You knew. -Maybe
You're tired of hiding it now
-And you want it to show up. -Oh.
-Wow nice. -[Sinan] Maybe.
I read an article about these things, about serial killers.
In fact, what the men really wanted was to be caught.
[Tuba] Well, forget about the murderer Matili, I think we should play this game.
We see that we are bored, we quit. Isn't it?
It was like this.
We were playing spin the bottle at the summer house. Just like him.
We would also peep into the girls' toilet at the summer house. If you want, we can do that too.
[laughs] My love, put your phone on the table.
-"Interest." says. Put it on the table. -Oh my love now...
-[Tuba] What? -Really...
-Are you hiding something? Should I be upset? -Of course not, but...
Alright. I am putting.
[Sweet] Aha.
-Did you relax? -Uh huh.
Hm. So we play a lot. Well okay.
Anyway, I didn't like everyone having a phone in their hands at dinner like that.
Come on.
-[Banu] Metin always mutes. -AA? Kerem's phone is always wrong.
-When? -Always.
Well, I don't remember anything like that at all. Gee.
Ok. From now on, we put it upright next to the television.
We look at the TV, then at my phone.
Let me tell you something? You don't need to place it next to the TV.
You don't need to put it upright. Just put it on the table.
I'm putting it upright on the table, look.
Take it down, take it down. Satan fills it.
Okay, I'm adding it too, but I'm telling you now.
If my mother calls, I won't be able to tolerate her nagging at this hour.
Unless there is an emergency, no one will call me at this hour anyway.
Here's my phone.
[Banu] We're just getting started. I wonder what will happen?
-[Suavi laughs] -[Kerem] What are you laughing about?
[Sinan] Wait a minute, friends, this is...
We're doing something crazy. Am I the only one aware of this, for God's sake?
No no, you're not the only one bro.
[Banu] It's not crazy at all.
[Defne] Dad.
-Sir dear? -Good evening everyone.
[all together] Good evening.
Can you come for a second, dad?
I am coming.
-[Esra] This was very nice. -[Sinan] Thank God he took it after his mother.
[laughs] That was a lot of peanuts. I love it.
Dad, can you give me some money?
-Of course. Why didn't you want it inside? -With my mother?
[people at the table talk among themselves]
-What happened? You argued again. -My usual mother.
-[Esra] How old is Defne? -He turns 18 in July.
AA? My daughter, it seems like just yesterday, the birthday we celebrated together.
Everything was pink and everything.
Dear Esrac, Defne was ten years old on that birthday.
Oh, I swear it feels like yesterday.
Time flows like water.
Well, I am now the age of the man I called uncle when I was a child.
What the hell is going on?
Uncle Sinan, let me see this salt.
Of course baby. [message voice]
-[Tuba] Wait a minute. The first message arrived. -AA.
[Kerem] Stop, stop.
-Uhh. We started great. -[Tuba] What happened? Give give.
"I want you."
Who's this?
-I don't recognise. The number is not registered. -What is that mean?
My love, I don't know. I don't know, I guess they got it wrong.
-I really do not know. What if... -Hah. Calling, open.
[phone rings with ƒ∞rem Derici "To the Only Owner of My Heart"]
ok
-Open it up. -Come on.
-Hungry. -Ok.
I really don't know.
-Hungry. -Okay, I'm opening it.
[kekeler] Hello.
-[Banu whispers] Speaker. -Speaker.
-[Tuba] Turn on the speaker so we can all hear it. -[yells] Okay, okay.
Hello. [sizzles]
Alo.
Alo.
He doesn't speak.
[yells] Hello. Tell me, brother, who are you?
Who are you brother, talk. You disturb me evening and evening!
Who are you?
[Metin imitates a woman] My love.
May God curse you, Metin! [everyone laughs]
-Metin. -Have you seen his face?
Stupid!
-[Text] I was joking. -Is this a joke?
I've been talking for two hours. "He believes." I say.
But you were scared, huh?
Of course I wasn't afraid, but...
"Who are you? Speak!"
-Don't bother with my husband. -You too, but you just sold me out.
[Kerem] It was going from the heart here.
[Suavi] It was really good.
Dad, if you're done, let me grab my phone, I'm leaving.
Say goodbye to everyone, Defne.
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
-[everyone laughs] -Hush, hush.
[door closes] Well, I'm sorry.
That is adolescence. We've all had it.
-They never withdraw at this age. -You seemed different at that age.
[laughs]
-How was it, how was it Sinan? -[Kerem] How will it happen?
A teenager with acne.
Cigarette in hand, like a Valley of the Wolves brother.
I was smoking at that time. But what? After all, we went to university.
Okay, yes, we couldn't become academics like you, but...
[Suavi] Hadi lan.
You were a size good in high school. That's why you became a gymnast.
Professional athlete and trainer
-It's called dear. -Please.
Metin, I'm sorry, did I push your buttons somewhere?
Why do you keep walking towards me this evening?
-I'm not walking. -Aunt Naciye, her mother,
He beat this donkey every day until it burst from water.
That's what motherhood was like back then.
Let's see how we will be mothers?
-Are you pregnant or not? -Well, no. Not yet.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Not yet, I mean, but you've decided.
-Like. -Very good. So to congratulate you...
There is nothing more.
And should I tell you something?
At least you're making love. There are also those who cannot find it.
[Esra and Suavi's laughter]
[yells] What the hell are you doing?
I mean, you know what? You got married, so...
You know, as the years go by, the frequency, tempo and energy in marriage decreases.
I'm not saying anything false. In conclusion, I am stating what exists.
No, they are trying to have children. Location? Is that the point?
Ok then.
I want to raise my glass to the children.
The only meaning of my life.
-Yes, let's remove it. -Come on, cheers. Come on.
-Cheers. -Well, friends, we were just talking about making love.
How did the topic come to the child right away?
Oh Suavi, you are not being used at all either.
I don't understand. What is sanctifying this child?
So life has no meaning without children?
I think this seems like a bit of an easy way out.
Why did he take the easy way out?
Of course dear. "I got married, had children,
oh, I became a parent. How nice, there is no one better than me.
To figure out the meaning of life, I don't know, to make sense of life
I don't need to chase after anything.
Because I became a mother. What more? "I became a mother."
But I don't want the child for that reason.
Why do you want it then?
-So there are many reasons. -Hmm, hmm. Give one example.
So, for example, to be a family.
One minute, one goal. Can't a couple become a family on their own?
Is it necessarily a third person or a third thing that brings us happiness?
Where did you bring this up, Suavi?
Brother, I am an individual on my own now.
What about me...
I think my own journey, my own happiness comes first.
I mean, if someone walks next to me, how nice, how good.
But this isn't meant to be a crutch.
If he will enjoy walking with me.
I don't love myself first, I don't think about myself,
I think I need to make it happen.
So is it selfishness? You may say so.
[Banu] Sometimes giving birth to children can be selfish.
[Tuba] Why was it selfish?
[tense background music] To save his broken marriage
Lots of couples are having children. Even then they get bored,
They do it again, they do it again. -Friends,
You are bringing a life into the world.
Isn't this a very sacred thing? So think about yourself.
What about those children? Is this sacred?
The best thing I did in this life was being a father.
Well, I didn't regret it even a day.
[Esra] I will say something. However, I agree with Sinan on this issue.
So a child is a very sacred thing. I won't even discuss this with you.
Look, let me tell you something.
For a whole day...
...one of my favorite things to do
After putting Damla to sleep, watching her while she sleeps.
Oh, I just realized.
In fact, it's my favorite thing.
Hmm, lucky you.
Wait until he turns 18 or so,
"Get the hell out of me. I don't want to see any of you." Let him say.
Then I will see you. Look, don't forget what I said.
Okay, I won't forget this, but you should also remember this,
The child feels like a second chance to me. Where are the mistakes you made in your own life?
It's like a second chance to come clean. [music ends]
‚ô™Now if they give me my lost years‚ô™
[Kerem] "I put it on a plate and eat it." you say huh?
-[Kerem] Slowly, slowly you will drown. -This is how I eat, brother.
[phone rings]
[Tuba] Oh, the phone is ringing.
-Hah. My older sister. -Open it up.
-What am I doing? -You are opening it.
-You will open it. You will say "hello". -Turn it on with speaker.
-Turn on the speaker too. -Okey stop.
Hello. Sister is a...
Where's the speaker on this? I'm opening it for a minute.
Why do you say that?
-[Sinan whispers] Tuba, show him. -Hello. Why did you turn on the speaker? Shut it up.
-Why did you say that? -So...
Well sister, I can't turn it off now.
What's happening? Who is with you?
I'm in your texts, sister. Kerem, Sinan, Banu, everyone is here.
-[everyone] Ah! -[Esra] Esra is also here.
-[Sinan] Hello, sister Zehra. -[everyone] Hello.
Hello to everyone.
I called about this job in Izmir, but you are busy. I call later.
Well... Sister, I told you so. I don't think of going.
Oh, okay. We will speak tomorrow. Good evening.
Good evening, sister. See you later.
Friends, I'm sorry.
The first phone call is not a sin. From now on it's legal, okay.
What is this Izmir business?
A new university is opening in Izmir.
-Should I go and apply? That's it, sister. -Well, it's good. Apply.
-Yes my son. You just come and go. -Son, I didn't say Beylikd√ºz√º. I said Izmir.
Well Suavi...
Honey, should I take it too? Do you have the luxury of refusing a job?
No but what should I do? Should I pack up my house and settle in Izmir?
If it were me, I'd move. Izmir is beautiful.
-[Sinan] Would you move? -Yes.
-To Izmir? -Yes.
My son said "Yes" three times. said. "I would." said. Even I understood.
My love. Am I the donkey's leader here? You "I'm moving to Izmir." you say.
-Where are you moving to? -My love, am I saying that for that reason? I...
I say this to support Suavi. The man is unemployed.
Thank you Tuba, you are very kind.
But I applied to a few places. I'm waiting for news. Here we go.
What happened to that court?
What court?
[Kerem] So you didn't file a lawsuit either?
What case bro?
Court, lawyer, lots of... Fifty shitty things.
After five years, they will pay only a small amount of compensation.
Will it be like a little boy? How many years did you work there?
Can they appoint people as they please? Can such a thing happen?
They didn't throw it anyway. They just didn't renew my contract.
Isn't that another kind of dishonor anyway?
You know, if you take it to court, you'll get it right down to your underwear. Do you know this?
I have panties. Shall I show you too? Grey.
-What am I saying, what is he saying? -What a dirty man is this?
I'm not saying anything else.
Friends, thank you all. You want to help but I...
These methods are not for me. So it was the court, the lawyer, the paperwork.
I can't handle it like that.
There was one thing: "That job is mine." I'll handle it my own way.
Without courts, without documents.
Without ƒ∞zmir.
Without ƒ∞zmir.
But do it as soon as possible, Suavi. So time passes.
It is necessary to maintain life.
I'm thinking of getting into the quail business.
[laughs]
Just don't sweat it too much.
-[everyone] Ugh! -Get up, get up, get up.
Look, you're laughing, but you really have to try.
After all, what you call success comes by experiencing failures.
Okay, I may have gone bankrupt with a lot of work. I agree.
But if I'm here today, I also know one thing.
Sinan, you work as a fitness instructor at a gym.
Kerem, how banal you have become.
Oh, haven't you ever heard of personal trainer, life coach, huh?
-Exit. -Oh...
Now the world is ketogenic brother.
-What sogenic? -Ketogenic dear.
O ne ya?
We last talked to the teachers today. In the hall with good teachers.
We say let's open one place. But only for elite customers.
A concept that has never existed before.
We will provide everything, from nutrition to exercise, in a package like this.
I will print the money. Everyone will work like a donkey.
Is my love okay? Are you opening a location?
My love, I'm giving an example.
When were you going to tell me?
My love, I'm giving an example.
So, where do you plan to find the money, Mr. Sinan?
-Eb... -Ebeb?
Brother, money will be found, okay? As long as it's your project.
Once you have a project, you get a loan. I don't know, it might be found.
You take out that loan. After that, this time they take those panties from you.
Brother, you know I have panties.
-Whenever you want. -You can take it from there.
Look, I'm going to nail one project.
I will scatter the money like this. Nah for you too. Especially for you.
-Look at me, I'll feed it to you. -We are proud of you.
-I'll tell you something... -You'll buy me panties, right?
From the best. [laughs]
[distant conversations]
You put something mambo jambo in it again, didn't you?
Metin Usta's famous almond curtain pilaf.
Look, no one puts currants in this.
But when combined with onions...
-You say we will stink. -You can't kiss me tonight.
What happened to the case?
It will be concluded next month.
Hmm. There's nothing wrong with prison, right?
So, we will solve it somehow with compensation.
So you'll finally have your driver's license?
I ate my son's driver's license.
Son, once this matter is resolved, I will treat you to a feast, a feast.
-If you put onions, I won't come. -What did you boil?
-Come on, I'm going out. -Stop. I'm coming too.
-Oh, don't drink that crap. -This is the end. I'm leaving from now on. [Laughs]
-The eclipse has started. -Well, he started slowly.
[Kerem coughs]
[bird and siren sounds]
Give it to me too.
Suavi, there is a problem.
What happened?
[sighs] What if...
Every night at ten o'clock...
-...a friend is sending something. -A kiss?
Here it is, photo.
Photo, what photo?
His own photo.
But you're just reading the articles, right?
That's what we would say, right? While taking it manfully.
Oh, you don't have much time left.
[low voice] Help me.
What, how, what help?
Well, the phone models are the same.
-Hm? -So we change it until the message comes.
Then we continue with the old order, huh?
Oh my God, so the photo will come to me?
You're not married or anything.
Sevtap is not here anyway. So nothing happens. Ha?
Oh brother, don't be ridiculous. Does such a thing happen?
If you're doing such shit, why are you even playing the game?
Did I want to enter? It was like I was very curious. Gee.
Sorry Kerem.
Thank. Thank you very much indeed.
Let Esra see those photos, then our marriage will end.
So you want it, right? Thank.
What kind of photos are these?
Here he is with Mickey in his pajamas.
What the hell should I do with Mickey pajamas? How old is this girl?
So young. He's in his 20s, but he's crazy. Childlike.
Brother, for God's sake, don't put me through something like this.
So you won't help?
And what kind of trouble are you?
Is something like that possible?
[Sinan] Ugh!
[Banu] Everyone bought it, right?
[phone rings]
My mother is calling.
I'm opening it.
-Anne.
-Hello baby.
-Hello. -How are you?
I am good. We gathered with our people. We are eating too.
Enjoy your meal. Then I won't keep it too long.
Look, I talked to your father, he arranged for the doctor.
The man is a professor.
He was coming from America for three days, but he intervened when your father asked.
-Hmm, nice. -I wrote the history
but now you forget. Save it somewhere anyway.
-Date of surgery... -Okay. Come on, have a good evening.
Good evening...
Is Banu okay? What surgery is this?
No, it's not that important. It's just a small intervention.
Plastic surgery.
[Kerem] What do you mean by aesthetics?
I'm getting my breast done.
Are you going to get your breasts done? But you didn't tell me. I do not know.
But do therapists get their breasts done?
[Suavi laughs]
Why?
So therapists aren't people? Why not have it done?
No, my dear Banucu, you misunderstood. Of course I didn't mean it like that.
The therapists I know help people see themselves as they are.
They teach him to love etc.
I love myself. I don't like my breasts.
-But I think you can solve this. -To solve?
Not everything is solved like that, dear Tuba.
-Why doesn't Metin do it? -Huh!
-What happened? -Don't ever go in there.
-Don't ever enter. -Why?
-Entering. -[Banu] Oh!
As you know, you are my husband.
Even if a person is a doctor, he should not do his wife's breasts, dear.
-You should not bring work home. -What will happen next?
While making love, "Oh, I did it so beautifully." Are you going to say something like that?
I don't think it's a sexy idea at all.
Self catering.
[laughs]
I think Banu is right. Imagine that you went to Banu for therapy.
[Sinan clears his throat, stamps his foot on the ground]
That's ridiculous.
[beep] Hah, to whom?
-What's happening? -Something happened to someone again.
[beep] Oh the bakery, the bakery is calling. No panic.
I'll take care of it.
[Sinan] Yes Metin, record. Health to your hands.
My mouth says hello, the food was delicious.
So Pilaf was really destroyed.
-Do you like it? -Very good.
Look at me, did you do these?
Of course not. But I am responsible for the service.
Oh wait, don't spill them on yourself. I will pour it last.
-Come and help with the tray. -Hah.
Did you hear that yours was going to therapy?
-Text? -Hmm.
So where did you hear it?
Kerem said.
[phone vibrating sound]
-Esra is looking for someone named Emel. -[Esra] Wait a second.
-Ms. Emel, Esra is coming now. -[male] Hello. Hello.
Hello? Hello?
Sir Emel Bey?
I'm sorry Ms. Esra, I'm disturbing you at this hour.
- Oh astaghfirullah, here you go. -I collected your laptop, but the video card is missing.
Since it failed again, I ordered a new one.
[Esra] Okay.
If you have urgent work, I can arrange another computer.
No, no, no, Mr. Emel. There's no need. So let's get it done by tomorrow, okay.
OK, we'll handle it. That's it then, good evening.
Good evening. Hah, come on, my dear.
Allah Allah.
Is there a male name called Emel?
After four boys, when there is a fifth boy
They set a goal.
I also had one teacher in secondary school. As Emel.
What happened, are you upset? What happened?
Shall.
You know, they just change names like that.
Let.
Of course. Pelin, but actually she is a Curtain Maker Osman, for example.
-For example. -No no. I don't do those things.
[message sounds one after the other] Message arrived. One two three.
Thing. From Oƒüuz.
This is Oguz. Astroturf field.
-Oƒüuz astroturf field. -Astroturf field.
Is there a match?
There was.
I didn't receive any message.
[Kerem] He will probably come.
Surely, this idiot must have forgotten.
Come on, leave it alone. It's like I don't know.
You only call me when a man is missing.
Is it really so?
What you said happened once. It has already happened to all of us.
How bad are you?
But if there are too many players, it's normal for one of them not to play, don't worry.
My dear, this is not a league match, it's just an astroturf field.
The purpose is for friends to come together.
That's the intention, but the message is not.
Just turn your phone off and on. Because it happens.
Yes, also did you update it?
Go away, you nonsense, for God's sake.
Let's call Oƒüuz and shit in his mouth. Sealess. Who are you?
[message voice] Ah! A message came to Sinan.
-Who? -Bundle.
"Call urgently."
-Public relations of the Fitness Center. -[Esra] Oh.
Secretary, you know. What public relations?
Here, customers' hours are constantly changing.
Of course, he keeps sending messages to let you know.
-Only Demet is a pretty sexy name, huh. -Metin, now. Ha?
-Bundle. -Don't struggle, nothing will come of it.
Look how she protects her husband. Of course, these are newlyweds. Sweeties.
Come on, call me, husband.
I wonder if you shouldn't get excited anymore, Tuba?
It's like you don't know what to say.
"Mr. Sinan, Ms. Nil√ºfer canceled." Why did he cancel it? "Because he's drinking now.
We will take Nevin Hanƒ±m instead. And from there to the vacant place
Mr. Sahra will come." etc. Nope. Tsk.
He's not the type to pull away anyway.
So Sinan keeps complaining about it all the time.
Nevermind. What were we saying to him?
-Hah, Montofon Demet. -Montofon no ya?
Breasts milk tanker.
You send it to me, brother. I make them smaller.
[laughs]
[vibration sound]
[notification sound] Ah! What the hell?
It came from me.
-I downloaded an app. -What app bro? Give me this.
Exercise app.
-What? -Let me see.
-Look, he's counting. -Exercise.
Aa!
-It's nice. -Let me see.
-What's this? -Bravo to you, Suavi.
-Stay fit. -What are you doing?
-What are you doing? -Started.
-I'm exercising, brother. -Let me see.
You are downloading. You write down your weight.
After that, it gives you a weekly program based on your weight.
You do it at work at certain times of the day.
-[Tuba] So, does this play every day? -[Suavi] Of course, of course, every day.
[Sinan] What about you, Suavi, what are you doing with these?
Come to our living room. I'll take care of you.
You are very expensive, son. I reduced it to three liras.
-[Sinan shouts] How many? -I'll download it, I'll tell you.
Guaranteed one kilo a week, ten kilos in ten weeks.
Should I say something? I swear to you
Look, I swear, I thought about this. They did.
Anyway. Now the topic is ketogenic...
It doesn't matter what you call it.
Now, for example, you are going on a diet, okay?
You say, "I will use light products."
[distant conversations heard]
[tense background music]
-Why didn't you tell me? -What?
That you went to therapy.
It hasn't been long since we started.
-When did you start? -I will go to the sixth one next week.
It's pretty much done.
Are you angry?
You were saying, "I don't believe in therapy." saying.
So now I believe.
What changed?
I am trying.
If we ever get divorced in the future
I don't want there to be anything we haven't tried.
So does it work?
I don't know, you tell me.
Oh, by the way...
...I learned something about all our fights and arguments.
Every couple argues.
But the important thing is not to be right in these discussions and fights,
come out happy.
-[Text] Let's make room. -Oh Metin, what did you do?
What have you done? [music cuts]
What is stuffed melon? [notification sound]
-Brother, I'm going to crack up. -A spoon.
I end the night with this. Last but not least. This is the end.
-Throw in a spoon. -I can't eat.
-[Tuba] Suavi received a Whatsapp message. -Message arrived, message.
[Suavi] I'm looking, wait a second, right now.
-[Banu] Can I have it too? -[Suavi] Wait a second.
The photo has arrived.
From who?
Jasmine.
Yes, right? Jasmine.
[yells] Guys, wait a minute. The message did not come from Sevtap.
Okay, why are you shouting?
I said this just to underline it.
Oh yes.
-This is a private message. This... -[Sinan] Wait a minute.
There are no specials tonight.
-You wanted to play this game. -[Text] What's special bro?
Friends, this is a video message. I can't open this.
[Sinan] It was nice walking to the German gardener, wasn't it?
-[Text] We talked about the rules from the beginning. -Friends, the article is complete. This image.
We made a deal. Everyone shows everything.
-It wasn't about the image. -You wanted to play.
-Sinan, don't be ridiculous. -Suavi, you insisted that we play.
I...
Tell me.
[Sinan] Oh!
-[Banu] Come on. -Friends. Text. My master.
-[Banu] What is that? -[Esra] What is that?
-You know, what size are these? -What the hell?
-[Text] 90 plus bro. -[Banu] Come to Suavi!
-Dear Kerem, can you look at me, brother? -Let me see.
[Sinan] Let me get your comments.
-[Sinan] Suavi, there you are. -Suavi, who are you?
[laughs]
Bu ne ya?
-The best message of the night. -That's it. This is it.
I'm proud of you.
Brother, a woman is a breast, and this is Suavi. Well done to you.
I will say something. Here's "Getting over divorce." we said.
No, he has a new girlfriend, I don't know what.
You are vulgar, we are sorry, but you are such a straw man...
-What a snake you turned out to be, Suavi. I applaud. -There you are, yes.
-Applause. -Be proud.
-Congratulations to Suavi. -Well done to you.
Well done to you. Halal. [frog voice notification]
[Banu] To whom did he come now?
-To who? -He came to Kerem.
[Esra] Oh! To Kerem? What the hell is that croaking? I've never heard of such a thing.
Well... I guess the kids changed it. Faruk, "How are you?" My dear, it's me.
-[Esra] Who is Faruk? -A friend from work.
I swear I've never heard of it before. Faruk, I don't know.
No, this is a new arrival anyway. In the accounting department.
A new person comes to their company every day.
So, did something happen? Why "How are you?" said?
So today, voices were raised.
There was some tension or something, I guess he was curious about that.
So you won't answer?
Nope. There's no need.
I also get angry at those who don't respond to these messages.
The man thought of you and was kind. Don't you have ten seconds?
I mean, I don't know, you know, "I'm fine. I'm at home." Write.
-TRUE. Let me write. -Wait a minute, wait a minute.
He's not at home. You're not at home.
-TRUE. -I mean, for example, I mean, you know.
No, I will write something, my dear. Well, naturally...
"I'm fine. I'm having dinner with friends."
[yells] And why... Who? where am i
why will he say it? Why would you say where you are? So what about him?
What is the need for such a thing, my dear?
What is this? What is this like, my friend?
Curiosity to know everything in everyone. The man asked you.
"How are you?" I am good. This much.
-What are you shouting, son? -There is this tool or that tool.
It ruined our whole life.
Nonsense, everyone knows everyone else's things!
What is it, sir, "Enjoying tea at Bebek."
Come come come. "Enjoying a boat in √áe≈üme." Damn you idiot, you in √áe≈üme...
...you are enjoying the boat and your house in Istanbul is robbed. Stupid.
[Banu tries not to laugh]
Let everyone know our every shit, every damn thing we do. How beautiful.
Allah Allah ya.
What is the need? Why would he know where I am?
Why should he know?
-Okay, I'm not answering. -Oh, that's it. This much.
[Sinan] What did this lunar eclipse make you?
I don't believe in such signs, hairs and feathers, but I swear.
[message voice]
-[Esra] Ah. I received a message. -The text has been sent to you as an e-mail.
-[Banu] First we look at Metin. -[Text] Let's see.
-Are you scared, baby? -What should I be afraid of?
"Great opportunity in Maslak. Two plus one houses with prices starting from 750 thousand."
Guys, is there anyone who wants a house in Maslak?
-Dude, these ads. Ugh. Bitch blah blah blah. -[Banu] You ripped it again.
-Come on it's your turn. -It is my turn.
-Oh Esra, can I do anything for you? -Take it, take it, take it.
Well, I just learned this thing. Are you doing something with voice command?
Oh, he'll try.
Post... Sorry. Read my mail.
-I did not understand what u said. -Enter the mailbox.
-I did not understand what u said. -He can't explain his problem to the phone yet.
-Son, you will ask about the message, not the mail. -Oh ok. I'm new, wait. One minute.
Read my messages.
You have one new message.
Ms. Esra G√ºrb√ºz is in single rooms, under the supervision of specially trained personnel.
and how about a life in five-star hotel luxury?
-Third Spring Elderly Living Center... -Give me this.
To get detailed information...
At this time of night, crazy things are coming.
This is the first time I hear the nursing home message.
-Did you call? -Ha?
Did you call?
Oh no, I...
I went with a friend last week because her mother was staying there.
I really liked it, in a garden like this.
Just to get some information like this...
So that I can get information?
It was fine. Well...
...if you go to the funeral, you will ask the price of the grave, right?
Kerem, I'm impressed. I guess I couldn't explain.
You know, it's so incredibly shiny and clean. The employees are very friendly...
-Why didn't you tell me? -...those who stay are very happy. Ha?
-Why didn't you tell me? -What about me,
What if this message does not arrive?
-I won't remember this... -So why didn't you tell me?
So you wanted to kick my mother out of the house? That's what I'm saying.
[tense background music]
Look, you're accusing me of things I've never done, nonsense things,
-I feel very sad. -He loves you, though.
Oh I know.
He looks after the children. He takes care of everything, doesn't he?
Oh ok. Look, but...
But what? What but? What? Come on what?
Kerem, I love your mother too. But we have to accept this...
Since your mother moved in with us
Our life has changed a lot. So our relationship has changed a lot.
Yes, our lives have changed.
In other words, the woman sitting somewhere with a mouth but no tongue is guilty.
He changed our lives, didn't he?
Okay, you forget it.
Forget. Forget what I said and explained. Everything is fine, okay.
Well... Dear Kerem, it's like this...
...I also love Sinan's mother very much.
So she's a very sweet, very good woman.
But when it comes to living in the same house...
...my love, I'm so sorry, but I couldn't do it.
Are you talking about my mother?
-Hmm. -[Sinan] Even I can't do this with my mother.
So now, sure look. Places like this aren't actually bad.
I mean, it's being cleaned. There are doctors there all the time,
-What if there was an emergency... -What do you say, son?
-Did you agree or what? -His seniors, I mean...
Kerem, would you live in the same house with Esra's mother?
Oh my dear Banucu, mine is alone.
Oh, mine is not alone. I'm losing it from there.
[Text] Oh my son... We all love Aunt Hayriye.
We have known each other since our childhood. Don't we know?
Otherwise, she is the most difficult woman in the world.
I did not receive the beating I received from Aunt Hayriye in the military.
-Obviously it wasn't enough though. -[Suavi] Oh Aunt Hayriye, living...
-She's a difficult woman. -I'm not saying it's easy anyway.
-Okay, that's it... -Why are you being hard on me?
-Did I say something? -[Tuba] Friends, okay.
-Let's go and look at the Moon. -Oh...
[Suavi] Come on, come on, everyone out, come on.
[city sounds]
[sad background music]
[Sinan] Kerem.
-No, I mean... -We got a little over it, okay, you're right.
Look, they seem to be intertwined.
Yes, but they will be leaving soon. Truths.
Kerem, for your mother...
...Sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Because I scolded like that in front of everyone.
[sad background music continues]
I wonder why the lunar eclipse affects us so much?
[music ends]
‚ô™The sea and the moonlight asked you, Where are you?‚ô™
‚ô™How can I say he left?‚ô™
‚ô™He left me and went away‚ô™
‚ô™They realized that our love is over‚ô™
-Let's take a picture. -Yes, okay. Give me.
‚ô™They always made fun of me‚ô™
-Photo. Photo. -Tamam.
[laughs]
-Do I have hair? -Come on.
-Yes. -Did everyone fit?
-Uh huh. Kerem, laugh a little. -I'm laughing, son.
-Hadi, hadi, hadi. -Hadi.
[message voice]
-What night is this? -Who is Sarpiko?
-Tuba's old fracture. -[Text] Why are you angry?
I wasn't angry.
-I was just kidding. Come on, pull this. -Come on.
-Hadi -Hadi ya. Hadi Sinan, hadi.
Look, it's caught. Come on.
Why do you still have this registered as Sarpiko?
-That's its name. -The guy's name is Sarp. Sarpiko?
Oh Sinan, okay.
-The girl recorded it like that while she was in love. -His ex-girlfriend.
-If it's an ex-girlfriend, it's dangerous, of course. -Men are like the Japanese, they never surrender.
Well, we are just friends with Sarp. There is nothing.
There's nothing to worry about, my love.
-Let's take this picture now. Fly. Two. -Why am I registered with you?
-My love. -One.
[message voice]
"I miss you, I can't stand it." What kind of message is this?
-I will tell you. -Hold on... What can't he stand?
-Sinan, I will explain. -Are you still seeing this guy?
We are seeing you. Can I explain?
-Sarp started dating a girl. -Yes.
But the girl's only concern is sex. Sarpsa is in love like a dog.
-That's why he calls the vet. -What do you say, Suavi?
Oh Suavi.
-So, the environment... -Take this.
Oh look. Look, let me call, okay? Best let him explain it himself.
-Call. Don't do anything like that. -Sinan, I will call.
-Call. -I will call.
Friends, silence. It's ringing.
[call tone]
Hello, I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour, dear Tuba, but...
They came to me again.
Did he call?
Of course he called. "Should I come to you?" said.
You didn't accept it, did you?
Just "Come." I was saying, what you said came to my mind.
That's why I sent you a message.
My dear Sarp, look, you know you won't get anywhere with that girl.
The more you talk like this, the more connected you will become.
Oh but I miss you so much.
Look, I know you're in pain now, but it's going to get worse later.
Or protect yourself a little.
Let me do that, right?
What a nice friend you are. I'm so glad to have you.
So are you, my dear Sarp.
Look, if you feel bad, call me.
I'm always a problem for you too.
Don't be ridiculous, what are friends for?
Thank you dear. Good night.
Goodnight.
-Are these going? -Yes. Thank you Kerem.
-My dear Esrac, you take this. -Are you relieved now?
How long have you been talking to this idiot?
-Yes, from time to time. -How often?
Sinan calls when he's in trouble.
My dick's antifreeze.
[Kerem] My Banucug, Tuba is taking your customer away from you. Get the news.
I noticed.
Pass me that spoon.
-How beautiful they all look. -Shall I give you this?
-Why didn't you tell me? -I bought parsley from the market today.
-I didn't say that either. -Don't talk nonsense to me.
I say sarp, you say parsley.
That's exactly what I'm trying to explain. Both are the same thing for me.
Sarp is just a friend.
The one you call friend still walks only for you.
-Shame on you, Sinan. -What? Am I being shameful?
Tuba, do I talk to my exes?
-They will break your mouth and nose. -Wait, you too.
Okay, if you're that bothered by me, I'll call and tell you. Is it ok?
Yes, you should have done this a long time ago.
Mr. Sinan was relieved. From now on, dear Tuba, you too can talk secretly.
If I said something to Sinan, I will keep my word.
Dear Tuba, there is no such thing. Isn't this Sarp your friend?
My dear Sinan, if this is your wife, you will trust like a donkey.
Well, it's not a matter of trust.
What if you saw the guy, the guy...
... loser, incompetent. What about me...
What are you doing with a guy like that anyway?
Didn't this Sarp have a house in Izmir?
That's why he wanted to move to Izmir. Of course, we have solved the issue now, brother.
[laughs] Sarp doesn't have a house in Izmir, right?
-Of course not, son. We're kidding. -We don't know him.
Come along, one by one. [laughs]
[phone rings] Defne is calling.
Let's open.
Sir Defne, are you okay?
I'm fine, dad. Are you in a position to talk?
-Yes, yes I am available. How's the party going? -Good, I mean it was good.
What happened?
No, we had a lot of fun and laughed a lot. It felt really good.
What?
Tibet is not good. I want to stay with you. Is it OK for you?
No, no, my dear. If you want to stay, of course you can.
Your mother and I trust you.
-You can explain it to my mother somehow. -Why don't you explain?
Do you think he will allow it?
Let me win Ankara, everyone will be comfortable.
Look, my dear Defne, we
We're pushing you a little hard, I know, but both your mother and I
-Because we care about your well-being... -Dad. Please don't defend my mother.
-Defne, you are being unfair. -He doesn't think about anyone but himself.
-It's not going too far... -I hope you don't die before my mother.
Goodnight.
[tense background music]
[phone hangs up]
Look, so therapy is working.
[whispering] Tuba.
[music ends]
Did you say it?
-Only to Tuba. -I'm only talking about Suavi.
I only told Kerem.
[Text] Kerem hasn't told anyone anyway.
Oh, what? She is my wife.
Well... Banu is also my best friend.
Pardon.
Pardon.
Oh, don't exaggerate, friends. The man didn't go to a whorehouse, he went to therapy.
-For God's sake, what's going on? -So, duh.
[frog voice notification]
The moon croak. Give me that phone, give me.
-Kerem, change this. -Quack, croak, croak. What's this croak?
Faruk. He was waiting for an answer.
The man is stubborn.
Well, okay, write an answer to this and let's get rid of it. So let's relax.
Okay, let me write yes.
I'm having dinner with friends, we'll talk later.
Hah, private life, private life, it's all lies.
But persistence, you see. [message sending sound]
[frog voice notification] Oh?
The answer came from Faruk.
Are you ready?
[laughs] Do you know what Faruk wrote?
"Ox." [Suavi laughs]
-[Text] Ox? -What is an ox?
Here I don't know. You will know this.
They also have such rudeness.
[phone rings] Oh?
Calling. Faruk is calling.
Then pick up the phone and let's all hear what happened. Let's open.
Hungry. Turn on the speaker too. Hungry.
Turn on the speaker too.
OK, I'm opening it.
[sighs]
Where were you sick? Where were you going to rest at home tonight?
Turns out he was going out. I'm worried about you here too.
Does he have a fever? Should I bring soup?
Why are you silent? Of course, that's because you don't have an answer.
Ox.
Let me tell you something? You can't do shit in life.
You haven't decided what you want yet.
Do you like women or do you like men?
You don't even know that yet.
Well, I can't waste time with you. Fuck you.
[phone hangs up]
[tense background music]
[Kerem laughs.]
The guys turn out to be crazy.
You think people are normal, but they turn out to be crazy.
Don't be ridiculous.
[laughing] So you don't think I'm a thing, do you?
Ok. [gulps]
In fact, we noticed him when he first came to the company.
All together. So, well, he's a bit of a soft guy, like that...
-He was slightly hanged. -What do you mean by hanging?
I mean, he implied something like that, but of course I...
...of course, I mean, I didn't give in.
Guys, don't be ridiculous.
Hop! What is he doing... What are you saying?
Esra.
Why didn't you tell me?
What if I have to tell you everything that happens in the company?
Also, do I say it? No. Metin, Sinan, say something. Well.
-If it's at work, of course it's work -Work environment. Maybe.
-That's right. -Ha? I mean, look, Esra.
Have you been together?
-What did we do? -Have you been together?
[loudly] Oh Esra, I don't understand what you are saying.
Can't you hear me?
"The man was hanged, and I did not give up." I say. What nonsense are you talking about?
Bro, all these topos are like this, don't we know? Now...
He thinks that he is a topo and everyone else is a topos.
-Metin, what are you saying? -He's telling the truth.
It was a very deep explanation.
No no, you're right. So the text says it right.
That's what it seems like. Gee. Esra.
[Esra is in tears] I'm asking a very simple thing.
Have you been together or not?
-You will say yes or you will say no. -You keep talking nonsense.
Do you realize what you are saying?
How many years have we been married? We have a family, we have a child. Gee.
Don't you know me?
Maybe I don't know.
Oh Esra, what are you saying?
My God.
What about you, can you think of me like this? What if...
Okay, I'm not saying anything to the person who did it. Everyone has their own choice, but so...
I swear to you.
-I have nothing to do with that guy... -Faruk.
I didn't have anything with Faruk. [background music ends]
Really I swear. [frog voice notification]
Message.
Faruk.
He missed sleeping with you so much.
[tense background music]
Esra, think about it this way.
He's not cheating on you with another woman.
So he's questioning himself, not your relationship.
[background music ends]
Did something happen?
-Ha? -"Did something happen?" I say.
Nothing.
You're okay then?
I'm fine, Kerem.
How are you?
-Good morning my baby. I'm fine, thank you. -Good morning my baby. If everyone is okay...
-Exactly. -Ok then.
Good morning my baby.
Sinan, what's happening to you? What are you cheering for?
-Let it go, maybe it will tell you something. -What will he say?
The man didn't tell about it for all those years. What will you tell now?
What am I going to tell?
We've been friends for a long time, right, Kerem?
Weren't you going to tell me who you are?
Wow, it's the same guy.
The one you spent your childhood with, grew up with, drank the same thing...
-You talk about everything. -No. We haven't talked about everything.
I think we needed to talk about one more thing.
What should we talk about?
Didn't I have the right to know, huh?
Don't I have the right to know who you are?
You will tell me this so that I can see if I approve.
I will decide that too. Because that's my responsibility.
-Do you realize what you are saying? -Do you realize what you didn't say?
Guys, I think this topic has gone a bit long...
No, no, wait a second, wait a second. Suavi, let's solve this issue.
No, now there is something I don't understand.
So, are you angry that I'm like this or that I didn't tell you this?
Either he had to tell you a lot of lies.
Now the question you need to ask yourself is this.
Do I want to be with this man anymore?
The man you call kissing other men. [sounds of arguing are heard from inside]
-Do you still have any questions? What question? -[Sinan] Kerem.
Friends, good evening. Thanks for everything.
What a good evening? Stand there, don't move.
Look at the man. Look at life.
Fall in love. Have a child. Years pass.
Look at what the man tells you.
How long have you been cheating on me? How long have you been cheating on me?
Esra, I did not cheat on you. None.
When was the last time we made love? Do you remember?
When was the last time you touched me?
I was sure. I was guessing there was someone but I was saying,
I was guessing this was something like Suavi's bitch.
Because even that makes more sense.
What do you mean it makes sense?
How long have you been cheating on me?
For a while.
-Guys, can I say something? -No no.
For a while. Is it ok?
-Another? -What else?
-Was there anyone else? -No, it didn't happen.
It was just Faruk. Is it ok?
Can we go home now? Let's talk there.
Should we go home? What? Let's go home. Let's go home.
Let's go home. Let's say to the children: "Children, your father is a faggot.
But don't tell your friends at school.
Because your father will be disgraced."
-Is it over? -It's not over!
You were going to tell me this. You were going to tell this to our friends.
Don't we have the right to know this?
-Can we go home? -I am not going anywhere. You fuck off.

[The phone rings with ƒ∞rem Derici "To the Only Owner of My Heart"]
-Hello, brother H√ºseyin. -Sinan, speaker.
-Dude... -And I say,
-"Is Sinan avoiding me for payment?" -No.
-So, did the lady like the ring? -Brother, let me call you later, okay?
-Well, I'm not available right now. -But she definitely liked the earrings.
-They are custom made, son. -Brother, I will call you. Good evening.
Who would like the earrings?
Its.
Who else will it be? What kind of question is this?
-I? -Yes.
Sinan, I don't wear earrings.
I don't even have a hole in my ear.
I know my love.
I was going to surprise you. I like the ring...
You are lying.
Have I ever lied to you, Tuba?
You bought those earrings for Arzu, right?
Kim?
Desire. Arzu, your lover before me. You bought it for him, didn't you?
No, desire is marzu. And what kind of game is it? Friend, let this end now.
Tell me you haven't slept with Arzu yet.
What do you say, Tuba? Look, you are in a very ridiculous place.
Then who did you buy those damn earrings for?
I say "to you", you don't believe me.
[Sinan's phone rings]
Tuba, Demet is calling. You know, don't open it at this hour.
[phone continues ringing]
Opening. Is it ok? Give me that phone.
Tuba, give me that phone.
Tuba, give me that phone.
Give me that...
Hello. My Sinan. Hello.
My love.
Well, I'm calling at this hour, but I'm panicking.
I bought a test from the pharmacy. It came out positive.
When two lines appeared, it was positive, right?
Oh my love, I think I'm pregnant.
What will we do now?
My Sinan, please say something. My love, why don't you make any noise?
Sinan, my love.
Are you there? Hello? [Tuba sniffs]
[phone hangs up]
Room.
[gagging and coughing sounds]
[knocks on the door]
Tuba, can we talk?
Room.
And...
Bu ne ya?
What's this like?
It hasn't been two years since we got married.
We were happy.
So why?
Why?
I don't know at all, honey. I dont know.
I never wanted to get married.
"Marriage kills love." I always said.
I didn't want children anyway.
What do I know about a child?
I was a free spirit.
Then this troublemaker came along and turned everything upside down.
"That's her husband." said.
"We will be happy." said.
"Trust me." said.
I trusted too.
[knock on door]
Either go away.
[knock on door]
Don't open it. Don't open it, please don't open it.
O Sinan, go away!
[Kerem] Esra, it's me.
A message came to you. From Kadir.
The...
[unlocked]
Kerem.
I don't know any.
[Esra] Kerem.
I don't know you at all, huh? I don't recognise.
I don't know Kerem. Can you listen to me for a second?
I don't know the man at all.
So it's someone you don't know
He wonders if your panties are red tonight, are they?
It's a joke, I mean, it's a joke between us. A guy I joke with sometimes.
Oh, someone you joke with. I don't care, he was just joking.
Okay then, let's make a joke. Let's look for the man.
-What? -I say let's make a joke.
-Let's talk. -No no.
Kerem, we have never talked before. I mean, he has a family, a child, a wife.
He had a wife, family, children... He also had a family. Look at the coincidence. Just like you.
Let's call now, let's joke.
-Let's joke right now. -Kerem, stop.
-Come here. -What should I talk to the man about?
-"We never talked." I say. -You will talk.
Kerem, we are not talking. What will I tell the man?
Alo Alo. Esra, is it you?
Yes it is me.
Did I write too soon?
No, no problem.
Now it was a surprise to me too. How come you called?
I was wondering about your voice. I wanted to hear it.
You did well.
We can even meet if you want.
But we talked about never doing this.
Or rather, you said we would never do that.
Yes that's right, I said so.
But we can meet if you want.
Yes. Sorry, I have to close now.
-Good evening. -Ezra, wait a second. One second.
Sir.
Your voice is very beautiful. It's much more beautiful than I imagined.
Thank you. Good evening.
No, I didn't understand the answer. Now we're all wondering.
We wondered. The man wondered what color it was, red. Let's see.
-What are you saying? -Let's see. Get up, get up.
-What will we look at? What are you doing? -I'll see. We wondered.
-The man is wondering. I was curious. -Wait, what are you doing? Oh wait.
-I'm going home. -To the children by their mother
And tell me what the hell you're doing.
All this fuss over a pair of red panties?
Ha?
-Here are some red panties. -What are you doing?
What is this compared to what I heard tonight?
Since we started, let me continue.
Now I will tell you a secret of mine. But you can't find it on the phone.
-No, don't do it. Don't do that. -Shush.
-No, Esra. No. -Shush. I will continue. Stop.
There is an accident.
Chicken.
That accident...
I did...
I was driving the car in the accident.
Kerem took the blame.
Because I drank too much again.
If I was caught, I would definitely go to jail.
At that time I told the children...
...who would look after it? What would happen? For that reason...
...Kerem took the blame.
Otherwise, I had the accident.
This remained a secret between us.
But we killed someone.
I killed someone.
That's enough, Esra.
Are you aware that we are talking about this issue for the first time?
Since that incident.
We are not talking about anything else anyway.
This secret is the only thing between us.
I'm so tired.
I'm so tired.
I'm so tired of this guilt.
I'm so tired of being a criminal.
[Esra] Why didn't we break up?
Why didn't we break up? We couldn't manage to be together.
I wish we had managed to break up.
Since the confessions came one after another this evening,
Let me confess something to you.
In fact, the only one in this house...
...I'm the fagot.
Toposh.
Son, you say it with a more accent... "Toposh."
There's a stressed P, an O stressed, and a S... "Shhh."
There, you exhale there. Toposh.
It is necessary to underline that ≈û. Toposhhhh.
It was like that, wasn't it?
Is he telling the truth... I can tell.
[yells] Tell me, did I say it right? Tell me something.
You were just saying. Say it again!
[Suavi] Kerem.
Not such a good idea, huh? Changing phones.
Why didn't you tell us?
Why didn't I tell you?
Why didn't I tell you?
[Kerem] Let me tell you why you didn't say it.
I was "toposh" for two hours.
I know what I'm going through.
[Suavi] You're telling me...
"Why don't you go back to work?"
Don't I know...
...to go back to work.
-Did they fire you because you were gay? -Metin, for God's sake.
It doesn't suit his gay mouth at all.
Say toposh. Also faggot. Say it the way you feel.
That's why you didn't open the case.
Kerem, I couldn't tell you.
How can I explain this in court?
I mean, I have a record...
...my students, my relatives...
I liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game very much when Banu first mentioned it.
Maybe like the moment when serial killers were caught...
But I never thought it would happen like this.
I couldn't think of it at all.
[sniffles]
Will you introduce us to Faruk?
You... Faruk...
I do not think so.
I don't think so, I definitely won't introduce him.
You will find a way to upset him.
[Sinan's phone rings]
[knock on door]
- [Banu] Repentance - [Sinan] Repentance, Repentance.
[phone hanging sound]
-My dear Tuba. -Tuba.
My dear, come on, open the door. Please. Tuba?
-Come on, open the door, Tuba. -Tuba.
Room.
Room.
-Oh Tuba, open the door, please. -He doesn't open the door.
-Tuba. -Get out. Move away from the door, move away.
Kerem. OK, back off. Get out.
Your mother called.
"Your son is becoming a father." I said.
He was very happy.
He congratulated me a lot too.
[door opens]
[door closes]
[seagull sounds]
Isn't it beautiful?
You are more beautiful.
We get it, we get it, you are newlyweds. Constantly chattering.
-It's okay, are you jealous or not? -I'm back, come on.
We're here, okay.
[Suavi] What about gentlemen, are we playing an astroturf match tomorrow?
-[Kerem] Well, I didn't receive any messages. -[Sinan] There is nothing coming to me either.
-[Suavi] If there is news, you can call me too. -[Sinan] Okay, okay, of course.
Oh Suavi, bring Sevtap next time. We don't want excuses.
-Yes. -Yes.
No, this time I won't listen to sick jokes. If necessary, I will bring it by force.
[laughs] Come on, see you.
-Gentlemen, have a good night. -See you later.
-It was a beautiful night, wasn't it? -Hmm.
-You made it spill again too. -[Metin laughs.]
I am glad you like it.
Let me see why you didn't want to play games?
I don't know, I didn't like the idea.
And you insisted on one extra. I didn't understand it.
Otherwise we would have played so well.
Whatever secrets you have kept from me now.
What secret will I have? I don't have any secrets.
-What beautiful earrings. Is it new? -Huh.
Don't change the subject. What was it then?
-[Tuba] My love, who are you writing to? -To Metin.
-Ha. -Thank you for the food.
Well done. My husband is a very thoughtful thinker.
BANU, YOU WERE VERY HANDSOME THIS EVENING!
TOMORROW COFFEE BREAK
-Wasn't it beautiful tonight? -A lot.
[phone rings]
-Who is calling? -Demet.
Don't open, don't open. Tomorrow "I haven't heard of it." you say.
What am I going to open anyway?
Let me tell you something?
I can resign from the club, just because of this woman. I swear.
You said, "This thing has become our black box." saying.
You are right. I think you can tamper with it...
...there is no point in spoiling it.
Al.
You can look if you want. He doesn't have a password either.
The lunar eclipse was truly impressive.
Yes.
-Goodnight. -Sweet dreams.
