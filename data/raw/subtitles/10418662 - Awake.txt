What you got?
All right.
They're cool.
Business is growing.
Twenty-nine.
One's missing.
Count again.
Here you go.
Hey!
Come on, you're 20 short.
Count again.
Dick.
Hey, Mom! Hey!
Oh, Sweet Pea.
Oh. Hey.
- I brought you this.
- Awesome, Mom. Thank you so much.
- Yeah, of course.
- Sleeping in the car.
Resting.
Worked the night shift.
I should have something for you
by the end of the week.
Noah?
You're going with your mother.
- Technically, I don't have to, Grandma.
- Noah.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom.
I have a church meeting tonight.
Can you keep 'em until 7:00?
Maybe they could stay the night?
Just have them back by 7:00.
- You're welcome to join us.
- I'll think about it.
So, how was school this week?
- Did you know birds come from dinosaurs?
- I did.
How about you, Noah?
- How about what?
- How was school?
Fine.
What are you looking for?
Nothing.
- Why are we even doing this?
- I'm tired, Noah. Okay?
I just worked the night shift,
and I'm doing everything I can
to get you guys back. All right? So...
I don't want you to feel bad,
but I don't want to pretend that...
Oh.
What did you do?
Nothing, I...
- Brake, Mom, brake!
- Hold on!
- Mom!
- Stop!
Yeah, Mommy, I'm okay.
Mom, the car's flooding!
- What do we do?
- Come to me. Quick!
Hold on.
You okay? Are you all right?
Take off your seat belt right now.
It's okay, I'm right here.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Come towards Mommy. Okay, right now!
Come towards Mommy. Quick!
I need you to go faster, baby.
- Come on, it's gonna be okay. Go!
- Mom!
Get out of there.
- Come on, Noah. Get out!
- I can't! My belt's stuck!
- Oh, fuck!
- Mom!
Fuck!
You okay?
- Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
- You okay? Matilda!
Matilda!
Matilda!
Come on, Noah!
Oh, God!
Oh, my baby!
She was out for a minute,
but she's gonna be fine.
Oh, thank you so much.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.
- She's good. She's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I don't know what happened.
- Oh. Oh, baby.
Power's out everywhere.
Cars, too.
I don't think we're gonna get
an ambulance here,
but the VA Hospital's just
four blocks away, and...
you're gonna need stitches.
- What?
- Stitches.
I'll be right there.
Uh, Exam Room 3.
Hey, excuse me! Excuse...
Hey, excuse me. Um, I need a doctor.
Um, uh, we just got into a car accident
and my daughter was, uh,
spitting up water.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
She's fine.
- Wh... Hey! Hey!
- I need some help here!
It's a terrorist attack, for sure.
What?
Terrorists?
Able to shut off all the power...
- to cars?
- Maybe it was the Chinese, right?
They built all this shit
so maybe they just turned it all off.
And maybe we're at war.
Maybe they blew up New York and LA,
and we're next.
I gave him ten cc's.
- That should put down a rhino!
- Someone!
It's a miracle.
Please, someone!
He's awake.
He's up, too.
The phones aren't working,
the power's out...
What happened?
The car's in the lake.
Always clear out the air.
- Always.
- Good girl.
- Hey, Doris, you good on meds?
- I got plenty.
The store's not taking credit cards.
Do you have cash for food?
The cash was in the car. In the lake.
I... I can see if I can pick something
up on the way home from the university.
I'm in at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.
I just need to get a little sleep.
You're still going to work?
Yeah. They don't have power.
They're gonna need security.
You know, there's no point
in you walking home.
Why don't you spend the night?
Thanks, Doris.
I don't know
how you sleep like that.
I'm not sleeping. Meditating.
Does it help?
Hmm. Think so.
You know when you wake up in the morning,
everything is good for a minute
before the shittiness hits you?
I get that minute when I meditate.
I tried yoga when my hip started hurting,
but...
it didn't work for me.
Do you, uh...
You have a little something
to help me sleep?
I don't do that anymore.
You know the judge said
that I wasn't allowed.
Well, I guess you really aren't using
if you're awake too.
I'm gonna head to work.
I'll stop at the pharmacy
and get you something.
Why don't you get some sleep?
I'm not tired.
Look at all the shooting stars.
Those are satellites, Noah.
- Hey, hey, hey, I need more stuff.
- Relax, okay?
Downers, benzos, phennies, tooies,
red jackets, people are crazy right now,
amped up. That shit'll be, like, gold.
I'll double the price.
No, fuck, I didn't say that.
Yeah. Yeah, you did say that.
All right. I'll do it. Fucking Gregg's
a man of his word, all right?
Cash in, cash out. Cycle of life.
I'll double the price
on all types of zombie pills. Come on.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Angel?
Where the fuck is everyone?
How'd you get
your cars to run, huh?
How come our cars aren't working?
What the fuck is going on?
- Hey!
- Easy.
Easy. I'm 68 Whiskey. Corporal Adams.
Out of Fort Huachuca.
What are you doing up here?
Not active anymore. I mean, I might be.
I don't know. They call in reserves yet?
I just don't know.
She's fine.
That's a lot of pills, Jill.
I can explain.
It's not what it looks like, I promise.
- Pack those up for me, please.
- Yes, ma'am.
I know you stuck your neck out for me
to get this job, and I am so appreciative,
- and... and I know I screwed up...
- I don't care.
Was that an EMP yesterday? Are we at war?
People are saying it's been happening
all over. Who would we even attack?
Major Murphy?
Hard drives are useless.
Anything with a microchip is fried.
Here's everything I have on hard copy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Any additional personnel?
I'm starting a hub.
We could use you.
What's going on, Murphy?
We were the "get answers" people
over there. They need those people again.
Major...
we need to go now.
I can't do that anymore.
This is the location of the hub.
I'd like you to get Lori and my children,
and...
get down there as soon as you can,
all right?
Absolutely. No problem.
You don't understand how serious this is.
You should have gone with her.
How is Murphy gonna bring the power back?
She's a psychiatrist.
It's not about the power.
There are contingencies for that.
Replace enough wires and fuses...
It's about the people.
Nobody can sleep.
After 48 hours of no sleep,
there's a loss of critical thinking.
Ninety-six hours,
hallucinations, motor failure.
But what about after that?
Organs will fail but then what?
Days of lying in paralysis
until the heart shuts off?
Yeah, yeah, I know what happens.
Of course, you do.
But this is different.
Everything is accelerated.
Symptoms are appearing
two to three times quicker.
It's gonna be total chaos.
We're not all going to die.
- Well, this is not happening to everyone.
- Yes, it is.
Well, there is this one woman
who can sleep.
They're bringing her to this hub.
Matilda was sleeping too.
My daughter was sleeping.
Are you sure?
Jill, they're setting up a whole station
based on this one sleeper.
That's how big of a deal she is.
Are you sure your daughter was sleeping?
Oh, I-I... I got into a car accident,
- but I'm fine.
- Was your daughter also hurt?
What are you saying?
I'm just saying,
odds are she wasn't sleeping.
What, do you think she's unconscious?
There are no such thing
as unconscious people anymore.
They're either...
on, or they're...
off.
Matilda?
Matilda!
Matilda!
Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?
Where is your sister?
Where is your sister?
You're hurting me!
Psycho.
I'm sorry, I know.
Where... Where is Matilda? Is she okay?
Yeah, she's fine.
Where is she? Please, Noah.
Church. Grandma took her to church.
Maybe we are meant to be awake.
'Cause you need to be woke
to see how the world really is.
And the Lord says,
"Come to me, all who labor
and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest."
She's not sleeping.
Not sleeping, Birdie?
Only my dad called me that.
I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm just... tired.
Not everyone...
asked to be called to God, you know.
Some people just are.
I know that more than most
because before I was a pastor...
I was a drug addict.
Covered up the evidence with a tattoo.
I overdosed.
I mean, I should've died within hours,
but I didn't.
I had built up such an immunity
to narcotics over the years, I just...
laid there for three days in rest...
'til eventually I passed.
But I was only gone for a minute
when they found me.
So, like Jesus, I...
returned from the dead.
Now, I'm not comparing myself to Jesus.
I just...
I'm saying that...
since that day,
I dedicated my life to serving him.
And to me...
it was a miracle that I survived,
you know?
And I think people really need
a miracle right now.
I'm not sure what...
I mean...
You think I need to die?
No.
No, of course not.
No, I'm sorry. No.
I, um...
It's just everyone is tired
and... desperate, you know?
People just want to know if you can sleep.
I can sleep.
It's just hard when I'm not tired.
Would it be okay if I prayed with you?
A lot of children say my prayers
are so boring, they nod right off.
Lord, we thank you for this day
and we thank you for Matilda.
What the...
Oh, okay.
717-127-0414.
Pizza, really?
Uh, no, it's a test
for mental sharpness.
- How'd you do?
- I-I got two wrong. It's fine.
Uh, we need to go and find a car,
and get your sister somewhere safe, okay?
Everything with a circuit's fried.
- Cars don't work, Jill.
- Some do, Noah. Okay?
So, can you just help me out, please?
Grab your bag. Let's go.
We need to be careful.
Oh, shit!
- Your daughter, can she sleep?
- What?
- Is this your boyfriend?
- No. No!
She can't sleep? Is she okay?
No, she's fine, she's fine. I was wrong.
She was just pretending.
Matilda was totally sleeping.
I woke her up.
What? She was sleeping.
Jesus, Jill, we need to get your daughter
to Murphy.
- Look, she could be key.
- Noah, we gotta go.
I know where the hub is.
They're setting up a station
to help solve this.
Look, they already have this one sleeper.
Brian, we're not going there.
Come on. Noah, let's go.
Hey! Yo, that's my bike!
Hey!
In our basement,
like an angel of peace,
a young girl sleeps.
So if she can sleep,
that means we can too.
So, as all mankind lays awake,
we pray for answers.
- Pastor...
- Yeah.
So what if she can sleep?
Miracles spread, Jim.
Just like good grows,
if you believe in it,
if you give it a fighting chance.
There is no over-the-counter
sleeping pills left.
Give us the stuff
behind the counter!
You'll have to talk
to your doctors. Get the notes.
You know no doctor's answering
his phone.
Please, I can't help you!
Come on.
Come on, Noah. Keep up.
Come on.
Whoa.
Wait here.
Oh, God.
It's only going to get worse.
What's happening to everyone?
If we don't sleep...
Your mind will bend and bend
until it breaks.
You snap.
Life changes like that.
But it's adversity
that prompts us to change
- when we otherwise wouldn't.
- Amen.
So then we embrace it.
Pastor...
She's awake.
- Matilda...
- When are you gonna make us sleep?
- Patience, please.
- I don't have patience right now.
Raymond isn't responding.
He's eating but not talking.
- He's tired, just like the rest of us.
- He's beyond tired.
- He'll be fine.
- We should sacrifice her.
No.
God sacrificed Jesus,
his own son, to save us.
God willingly sacrificed himself
for our sins.
There is no sacrifice needed.
We... We only need prayer.
God help me,
I'm willing to be Pontius Pilate
- and condemn the girl.
- Robert, sit down.
Sit down!
- That's enough.
- What good is prayer?
We need sleep.
Oh. Matilda.
- Mommy!
- Hey, hold on.
Please, sit... Sit down everyone.
Jill, we just wanted to pray with Matilda,
that's it.
She can sleep. Maybe she can help.
Lord knows we all need help right now.
Come on. Matilda is my daughter,
and she's coming with me.
- Not legally, she ain't.
- Please, sit... sit down.
Doris... Doris takes care
of those kids by law.
You're right.
But right now, with what's happening,
I can help, and you know I can help.
- Okay, come on, Matilda. Let's go.
- She has to stay here.
Hey, Jim.
She's special.
- She is.
- Okay.
- Just calm down, everyone.
- Mom?
- Pastor, you promised.
- Sit down, please.
We're on the same team here.
You're all absolutely right.
- She is special.
- That's right.
But she can't help anyone here.
Now, we're all gonna die
if we don't solve this.
Right now, your brains
are slowly swelling.
Our cranial walls are impressing
on the brain,
and it's affecting critical thinking.
It's what happens when we don't sleep.
Now, the more excited we get,
the more blood flows to the brain,
the worse we are.
So, the best thing we can do right now...
is take a deep breath...
and calm down.
Now, we're gathering scientists
and doctors to help solve this.
And they can.
And all they need is the girl.
Mom?
No one dismisses the value of science,
but neither is she a test subject
to run experiments on...
- You're not taking her anywhere.
- Jim, please.
- That's right.
- Prayers are not gonna save...
Fucking people,
if you don't hand her over,
I'll be back with the Army,
and they're not gonna ask nicely.
- You calm down!
- Is that what you want?
Because unless you people wake up,
that is exactly what is gonna happen.
And book throwing, that's gonna...
Jim, what have you done?
Doris took her down the back.
Noah, Noah, look at me.
You're gonna be okay. All right?
I need you to meet me in the forest
out back. I'm gonna get your sister.
- She in there?
- Hey!
- Bring her out!
- Get her out here!
She's not in there.
Get the guys. Let's look out back.
Where is she?
She's not in there? She was.
It's a miracle.
This isn't Jesus
rising from the tomb, Doris.
This is not who we are.
Jim?
Jim!
Matilda.
Oh, my God, my baby.
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
- Grandma told me to run, but I couldn't.
- Oh, that's okay.
- Are you okay?
- Oh. No, I'm fine, baby. I'm fine.
- Please.
- God spoke to me, Pastor.
- Put it down.
- We can't let her leave.
Jim, put it... put it down, please.
You're scaring everyone.
Jim!
Please put down the gun.
Come on, stay close.
- Come on.
- Mom, stop, please!
What about Grandma!
Baby...
Your grandmother can't run, okay?
She has a condition.
- All right?
- But Mom, please...
No, no, no, no. She's gonna be fine.
- I need you to keep up with me, okay?
- Okay.
How are you feeling?
No more running.
- All right, piggy-back time. Come on.
- Okay.
Let's go, Noah.
This way.
Come on.
We're here.
Come here.
We're gonna need a car.
You stay here.
I'm gonna go get one.
Where are we going?
They call it the hub.
We can't go there.
- You don't know what they're capable of.
- But we need to find a cure.
Noah, it's not that simple.
It... It's right here,
wherever this... this is.
I touched a dead body to get this.
A dead body!
It's not safe there.
What's your plan here, Jill?
We bring Matilda somewhere safe,
we both die, and she lives alone?
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
Here.
Light this. Light it.
- Burn it. Burn this, and we can't go.
- Noah, stop that.
It doesn't work.
Wake up, Mom.
This is our only chance.
If we're all gone,
she'll be dead within days.
There's another woman there already.
They're gonna find a cure. They will.
Please.
Okay.
Hello?
Hello?
Gregg?
215-124-0519.
Not even close.
Hello?
Gregg?
We got the pick of the litter.
How about the Beemer instead?
Idiot! It's gotta be an old car.
What was that?
Gregg.
It's just Gregg.
He's, like, still awake.
He can't even sleep now?
Shit.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep, baby, sleep.
Okay.
Okay, can we focus?
Get that Camry started?
Goddamn!
World's in chaos
and you're wasting time stomping heads.
Why can't we do the Beemer?
This is the last time I tell you.
We need an old car. No electronics.
It had no battery in it
when whatever the fuck was happening...
Now I'll start it.
The Camaro or the Dodge should work
with one of the older batteries.
Get in. Give it a shot.
Ahh...
Transmission's in.
Fingers crossed.
It's fine.
- Tell me when you're ready.
- Yeah.
Whoo!
There it is.
Told you we could boost the battery.
- Sweet!
- Go get the keys for the Dodge.
And grab the battery we brought up
from the basement!
Ha-ha!
But I get the Camaro.
What?
I get the Camaro.
- I don't want a Polara. I want a Camaro.
- Just grab the keys, pendejo.
All right!
All right.
You find it?
They're in here somewhere.
You find 'em.
I want the Camaro.
Is that right, sheriff?
I'm taking that fucking car.
You're not.
Yo, you hear that?
- You heard that, right?
- Yeah.
Someone else got a car running, too.
Fuck.
Man, they were stocked up. Medical shit.
Bet they could sleep with that.
Let's go.
Grab all the keys.
We'll come back for the Dodge later.
Here. It's easy.
Just one motion.
Who's Emily?
My girlfriend.
Ex-girlfriend.
Did you guys ever...
do it?
What?
Shit.
Mom?
Everything okay?
Noah's never had sex.
I...
I have.
Hey, get in.
Seat belt on.
So, what happened with this girlfriend?
No.
We're... We're not going to talk about this
right now.
Noah, come on. I basically...
I basically had you when I was your age.
We do not need to have this conversation.
Okay.
- But you can talk to me if you...
- Are we done?
Yeah, we're done.
Why her?
Why not us?
What's this?
Stay in the car.
Those were Murphy's guys
that shot up that car.
I worked with Murphy, overseas.
She helped me get a job
at the university and...
helped me with rehab, too.
She's a psychiatrist, Noah.
Sleep expert.
In the desert, she would...
help set parameters for interrogation.
Sleep deprivation, it was torture.
They killed people.
The kind of things that we would do
to try to find answers, it's not human.
Are we still going to the hub?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
We're gonna need, like,
a book on mapping.
Hey, sweetheart.
Hey.
You okay?
Mm-hmm.
Come here.
I... I want to make sure
that you understand how this works, okay?
Mom, I know how a library works.
Yeah. The computers don't work anymore,
so...
This is gonna be your new school.
So, when mommy's gone,
you'll need to find a library.
Okay? And... read. Don't stop reading,
and I...
...and I need you to learn
as much as you can, okay?
'Cause you are my smart girl.
All right.
All right. Um...
Um, come with me over here.
Here we go.
Okay, look at me. I'm gonna teach you
something very important, okay?
I need you to learn
how to shoot this gun, okay?
And, look at me, not just for people,
but for animals too. All right?
And we're gonna find you a rifle,
and you're gonna learn
how to shoot that too,
because the world
is different now, baby, okay?
And you gotta be prepared for anything.
All right? Here we go.
Put two hands on the gun for me.
There you go.
Okay.
Hold onto it strong
just like the handlebars of your bike.
Put this foot forward. There we go.
Nice strong stance, okay?
Keep both eyes open.
And you see that eye groove?
I want you to look right through that,
all right?
Now focus, breathe.
You can do this.
I don't like guns.
- Matilda, please.
- I don't want to.
- You have to.
- No!
- You have to.
- No!
- Yes, Matilda!
- We're gonna find a cure, okay?
And you and Noah are gonna shoot the gun.
Now you do it.
- Oh.
- I'm going to the car.
Wait, baby. Baby, come...
Hey!
Did you shoot at me?
No. Noah, I thought you were in the car.
I was here. I said I was here.
Who's in the car, Noah?
No one.
You said to find books on mapping.
Just don't shoot at me again, okay?
I think the coordinates lead here.
Mmm.
It looks like...
it... it's 1,500 miles away?
I think it's 150 miles. I don't know.
We haven't slept in four days.
I-I wrote down the directions.
I think.
Hey!
Matilda. Come on.
No. No.
Stop! Stop!
Hey.
I'm not stopping. I'm gonna hit you.
I'm not stopping.
Fuck you!
Hey, I ain't gonna hurt you.
I ain't.
I promise.
Just, hey, let me have the boy.
No, you can go. I'll let you go.
Hey, give me the boy.
I'll let you... I'll let you go.
I'm just messing around.
I'm messing around.
We're all free men here. It's all good.
Hey, can I... Can I have that gun?
Noah, I'm gonna shoot at one.
They're gonna scatter. You're gonna
go inside and lock yourself in, okay?
Noah!
- Noah!
- Hey, give me... Give me the gun.
Are you gonna shoot me?
Go on.
Sweetheart...
Noah, run.
Noah, run!
Yeah, run, Noah, you pretty little bitch.
Hey, Mommy. Get in.
- Get in, Mom, please.
- Get in!
Yeah, get in.
- Who are you?
- Why does it matter?
What is your name?
- I said, "What's your name?"
- Dodge! Dodge, call me Dodge.
How did you get out, Dodge?
I was locked in the cells,
guards were gone, okay?
We were starving, and I thought
that, you know, I was gonna die in there.
And then the guards came back
and opened the cell.
- You just walked out?
- Yeah, I just walked out.
- Where are you heading?
- I'm in a red fucking jumpsuit. Okay?
I'm heading far away.
- Far from here, okay?
- Watch out!
Ha!
There are no bullets in that.
What?
There are no bullets in that gun.
I keep the keys. And we need gas.
No bullets, huh?
Fuck!
Oh, my God.
Mom?
Okay, that should be clean enough.
So, you saw I put it in the gas tank,
right?
And now I want you to just, um, suck on it
like a straw,
but do it hard,
and then when it comes out,
put the gas in the tank.
You're gonna put it in here, okay?
So your sister can sleep, huh?
Where's your father at?
He died...
in the war.
Oh, he served.
Not bad.
Not good either.
Change of clothes, baby!
Go on.
Come on, you can do it.
Come on, you gotta learn, Matilda.
You got this.
Oh! Oh.
- I drank it.
- Okay, baby. It's okay. It's all right.
Spit it out.
Hey, your mom's hardcore, man.
She's getting Matilda ready
in case we can't find a cure.
- She thinks I don't know what she's doing.
- A cure?
You guys are trying to find a cure?
You know, the funny thing is,
I usually sleep, like,
two to three hours tops at night,
but now, you know...
So, you're taking our car?
Well, depends where you're heading.
North. Lewisburg, right?
Hmm.
That's where I'm heading, too.
North.
You know, you should probably
hang onto it.
You, uh, look pretty mean
pointing it at people.
Just in case something happens.
That's good, baby.
Remember, two hands on the steering wheel.
Yes, I have two hands.
Okay, I was just telling you
so you don't forget.
You always say
I have a really good memory.
- Why do you think I'll forget?
- Eyes on the road, please.
Thank you.
Fixing this car is gonna be so hard.
Oh, man. Okay.
But there are books on that, okay?
You hear?
Burn the books, man. Burn 'em all.
- Don't need those anymore.
- Ah, eyes!
Can you maybe just not...
Focus on the road, please.
Not talk to her
so she can concentrate, please.
Enough people said
that the Earth was flat,
so the Earth was flat.
Then, they said the Earth was round...
so the Earth was round.
The Earth is round.
Prove it.
Science proves it.
Science?
And who understands the science, huh?
Eyes on the road, please, always.
Enough people talk
about something, right?
Then it becomes fact.
Then they put it in the books,
and then the book becomes fact.
Then it's settled.
Then no one understands it anymore,
no one even talks about it anymore.
Fuck, this is why
we gotta burn the books, man.
He said the F-word.
I know. Please shut up.
Sorry.
- She's a kid.
- Okay.
You know, my grandmama,
you know what she used to tell me?
- Huh?
- That all the world's problems
could all disappear in one generation
if every kid grew up
forgetting all the shit they were taught,
the shit that doesn't make sense,
but you're taught it enough times,
you believe it.
Then we can actually live in a world
where no one is starving...
and everyone's equal.
- Really?
- Whoa.
I'm sorry, guys.
I used to think she was crazy, though,
Grandma.
Man, but now...
maybe she was on to something.
- Watch out. You see that there?
- Yeah.
Go right around the car, just like that.
Hey...
Slow down. Slow down, put the brake on.
What the fuck?
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, right now!
Put your head down, Matilda!
- Come on.
- Move, move!
I'm trying, I'm trying!
Watch out, Matilda!
Matilda!
Press the gas, Matilda!
Press the gas!
Go, go, go!
Mommy!
Mom!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
why're you stopping the car?
You see those lights ahead?
Mm-hmm.
Noah, do you see them?
Yeah.
That's the hub.
We have to get off the road.
Are you guys sure
you don't want me to stick around
and maybe help
with whatever y'all are doing?
No, you go to where you need to get.
- Yeah.
- Bye, Dodge.
Bye-bye, kids.
It's time for me
to get the fuck out of Dodge.
All right.
Hey, why'd we stop at this place?
We're just gonna, um...
I'm gonna just go first, okay?
Make sure it's safe.
If I don't come back,
I want you to stay in this house, okay?
There's enough food
to last you about a week.
- No. No, no, no.
- Mat...
It's just in case.
It's just in case.
And if anyone comes, I want you to hide.
Okay? Especially men, okay?
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
It's just in... It's just in case.
It's just in case.
Hey, Noah.
Come back.
I will.
Don't come after me, okay?
Aww.
Army baby needs her meds.
Fuck you, Danny.
Navy prick.
- Diaz, we're going up.
- Let's go.
I'll take them up.
You watch the bridge.
We'll get you situated.
It'll be all right.
Come on, let's go.
Checking the bridge!
- I can't do this.
- Just keep taking the meds.
It'll help you work.
I don't have training
on the hemopurifier.
I'm not equipped for...
Ah, shit, what was the code?
I wrote it down.
Two, zero, four, six.
Two, zero, four, six.
Okay, let's go.
Two, zero, four, six.
Two, zero, four, six.
Two, zero...
four...
Four, six...
Four...
Two, six...
Zero, two...
Okay.
Two...
zero...
four...
What...
Come on.
Please, please, please, please.
Six.
Hey, hey.
- Huh?
- You.
That's mine.
Huh? Oh, okay.
Okay, I'm sorry. I, uh...
Oh, wh...
Where's the woman, uh, that can sleep?
Yeah.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
You need blood samples?
They already did radio x-ray.
Yeah, I need blood...
I need to take blood samples.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
How much blood can you take from me?
It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I want out of here.
Good. I can help you with that.
You need to raise my daughter.
I have a little girl. She's ten years old,
and she needs you to help her
in the new world.
I...
I can't...
I...
- I can't...
- No.
Is... Why?
She can't make it on her own.
She needs somebody to help her.
Okay? She needs someone to help her.
You're the only one who can do it.
In the next few days,
the rest of us are gonna be dead, okay?
I'm gonna take you out of here.
I'm the one that needs help.
I was supposed to be dead
months ago.
You're crazier than the rest of them.
Jill?
Dr. Murphy.
I, uh...
What are you doing here?
I came to help.
After you left the campus,
Brian helped me with the coordinates.
Brian...
My family, are... are they with you?
Oh...
No, uh...
Brian was, um...
I'm... I didn't see him again.
So I'm assuming he was here.
They're not here?
I'm sorry.
Uh...
Is there a cure?
It's been six days, and we're no closer.
We have, um, a cocktail
that helps with mental acuity,
but it's... it's causing some...
neurological damage.
But it is...
It's buying us some time.
This morning, I...
I thought...
maybe the only answer...
we're gonna get is...
that none of us are gonna survive.
But...
you got here, right?
I mean, that must mean something.
Get some meds...
get situated, and let's get to work.
I'm so glad you're here.
Oh.
Uh...
Oh.
Hands up! Get out!
- Get down! On your knees!
- Get out of the car.
- Hands up!
- No.
- Don't shoot, okay?
- Get down on your knees!
Don't shoot!
- Listen!
- Get out of the car!
- No, no!
- On your knees!
- Okay, okay, I'm here to help!
- Get out of the car.
- I'm here to help.
- Show me your fucking hands!
- Oh, no.
- Listen.
No, no!
Hands up! Hands!
Hey! Oh!
Oh, God!
Don't fucking move!
On your fucking knees!
I'll blow your head off!
I will shoot you in the fucking face!
- Get out of the car. Hands up!
- Okay, don't shoot!
Put your hands up!
- We're here to help. Okay?
- Keep moving! Show me your hands! Go!
- Keep moving!
- She's just a little girl!
Stop moving!
I can sleep.
I can sleep.
I can help people sleep?
Yes.
And we need to find out
what makes you so special.
Is he still alive?
Oh, yeah, she is still alive.
We, um...
had to ease the tension by...
draining the cerebral fluid, but...
that hasn't helped.
A catch-22. The only way
to ease the tension is to drain the fluid,
the only way to clean the brain
is the fluid.
Can I touch her?
Sure.
You're such a brave, sweet girl.
Ether.
Well, see?
Nothing.
No effect.
Most animals are able to sleep...
after the incident, but chimps, well...
they were always closest to humans.
Hi.
I'm Dr. Murphy,
I'm... I'm a friend of your mom's.
Can she?
Uh, we're gonna, um...
try the ether on you now, Matilda.
- To prove that you're special.
- Will it hurt?
No, we're not gonna hurt you.
I'm a doctor.
We don't hurt people.
Kinda weird, huh?
Yeah.
Slow, easy breaths, babe.
There you go.
Nice and easy. It's okay.
Nice and easy.
She sleeps.
Poor thing.
Amazing.
Hey.
I...
I want to be disappointed...
that you didn't tell me about Matilda
after all I've done for you.
But, as a mother, I understand.
How long have I been here?
Uh...
Eighteen hours.
Why can she sleep?
Who?
Who? Matilda.
Has she had any, um... any surgeries?
How long have I been here?
It was, um...
some sort of a...
a solar flare, we think.
It... changed our electromagnetic wiring.
It affected our glymphatic system.
Messed with our...
our clocks.
Matilda.
Matilda.
Oh, please, let her go.
Jill, your survival...
Our... Our survival depends on Matilda.
Hmm?
Gotta keep trying.
Oh, no, please.
Oh, no, please, please.
No, no, no, that's my baby.
That's my baby.
That's my baby girl. Please just take,
like, blood samples or something, please!
You really an electr... electrician?
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.
It's a cocktail of anti-inflammatories,
stimulants, other things.
It reduces the beta-amyloid.
It'll help.
Um, it's most effective
when injected near the brain.
The carotid.
Fuck that.
Fuck...
What...
Okay.
Ah.
I think she stopped breathing.
Huh?
Defib. Hey! I need your help! Okay.
Okay, come on.
- I need you to press "charge."
- Okay.
- Okay? Charge.
- Ready. Charging.
Clear!
You're hurting her.
We're trying to restart her heart.
Do it again.
- Charging.
- Clear!
One more time.
Charging.
Clear!
It's all the spiders in here.
There's too many.
That's why they're all melting.
We have to get rid of the spiders.
- It's all the spiders in here.
- Well...
Let's get her brother up here...
so we can compare them.
- There's too many.
- What?
I have to save...
We need to save her.
We... We need...
- You lied to me.
- We... We just...
You wanted to find a stranger
to leave Matilda with.
I guess that's what you do.
You rely on other people
to raise your kids.
No!
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Noah!
Why did you bring me here? Why'd you
make me think it was just for me? Why?
- I'm sorry.
- That doesn't mean anything.
Noah! Noah! Noah!
Noah, don't do this! Noah!
Please! Noah, please!
- Don't!
- You? You're coming with us.
Hey, you? You're coming with us.
No.
No, no. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, please!
Please, please, please!
Noah, please.
No, don't take...
Don't take my other baby, please.
Please don't take my other baby.
Grenade!
Grenade!
Fuck. Everything's gonna be just fine.
- We're taking fire!
- I'm on it.
No one's attacking.
They're losing their minds.
She's okay? You're okay.
You're okay. All right.
I know we can do this.
Get down on the ground!
- Get down on the fucking ground!
- Okay, okay.
Sandra?
Sandra, is that you?
Yeah. Yes!
Yes, yes, it's me!
You fucking cunt.
Huh? Huh?
Don't fucking look at me!
If you move,
I swear I'll blow your fucking head off!
Hey! He's just a kid!
You're just seeing things, okay?
No one is attacking us!
Yes, good.
He's a kid.
No, no, no, no. You're good, you're good.
I'll fucking kill you!
Ah!
We're sacrificing the child
for no reason.
This is an extinction event.
Do it.
No! No, no, no! Oh, no!
It's okay.
Matilda!
- Matilda.
- Mom?
Jill, I-I-I can't let you take her.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What are you doing?
- Put the knife down.
What are you doing?
Please, please.
Aah!
He didn't remove the air from the needle.
You have to remove the air,
or you can die.
I had to.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Come with me.
Where's Noah? We have to find him.
- We gotta find your brother.
- Noah?
Mom!
Come on.
Okay, other side.
Mom! Mom!
Over here! Noah!
Noah! We have to go!
Dad taught me how to do this.
- You gut fish from the head to the tail.
- Noah, don't touch that!
Noah!
Please wake up for me, please!
Mom! Please, Noah, please!
Okay. Okay, come on, Noah.
Come on, baby. Mommy's here.
Please wake up for me, all right?
Wake up for me, please.
Yeah. Come on, baby.
Okay, okay.
Wake up! Mommy's here, wake up!
Where...
Matilda!
Coming!
Please.
Okay. Okay, I got it.
That's it. Turn it on. Put the pads on.
- Okay.
- Adjust.
- I can't.
- Okay.
- I need help.
- Come on! Come on!
Okay. Okay.
What else?
- Okay.
- What else?
Wait, we have to clear.
Noah.
Noah.
Noah.
Please, Noah, please.
Noah. Noah, Noah.
Noah?
Mom?
I think Noah's...
Mom.
Go.
It's okay.
Noah.
Hey, Noah!
Noah, come on, please.
Noah.
Noah, please. Noah, please.
Noah, please.
He's not dead.
Mom, he's not dead.
He's not dead.
Noah.
Hey, Mom, he's alive.
I was dreaming.
- Noah.
- Mom.
I was dreaming.
It's okay. It's okay.
Mom.
Oh.
No, no.
No.
Who are you?
I'm their mother.
Thank you. Thank you.
Mom?
Mom, can you hear me?
You were right...
about not wanting to come here.
You were right...
to try to find someone to help Matilda.
I know you love us.
I know you do.
I can't lose you, too.
We need you.
Matilda needs you.
I need you.
You died, Noah. You died.
Your heart wasn't beating,
I listened to it.
And then when I got the defibrillator,
I brought you back.
Yeah, I owe you, okay?
We don't have lots of time to discuss it.
Mom's not gonna make it.
Did I die?
Did I die, too?
- What?
- In the water, when the sheriff saved me.
I mean, there was nothing,
absolutely nothing,
and then the sheriff was pushing
on my chest, he was hurting me.
Maybe I started over?
So you're saying...
I mean...
Oh, fuck.
You have to trust me, Mom.
Put her down.
Gently.
Okay.
Come on, grab her leg.
