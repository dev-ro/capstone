Lovely...
That's a good dog!
The water's freezing.
You should wait a while,
we only just ate.
You pigged out,
but I only had a sandwich.
It's wonderful.
- Arnold, I don't feel so good.
- It's the cable car, darling.
What's up, Maggie?
Nothing, I feel okay now.
The kid was throwing a tantrum.
All this movement
is making it kick.
Think what it'll do on the boat.
If there was a risk, the doctor
would've advised against the trip.
The boat's only for island hopping.
Don't count on it, Arnold.
Alan hired the boat for a month,
he wants to see the archipelago.
She won't be able to do that.
Then leave Maggie and me on an island
and pick us up on the way back.
- Come on, darling, sit down.
- Yes, good idea.
Careful!
- Damn. I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.
I'll pay for it.
It's the least I can do.
My husband's always
causing chaos.
- I'm sorry.
- It's no big deal.
But I heard you mention a boat.
Do you have room
for someone else onboard?
Want to come with us?
Guys, would Alan mind if
we take along an extra guest?
I'm visiting friends on one
of the islands. I just need a ride.
All right. It's settled then?
Sure.
I bet he's not here yet.
He's always late.
Here he is!
- Hi!
- Here we are!
- Let's go and meet him.
- Look how tanned he is.
Hi, how's it going?
- You look great!
- With the bulge!
Hi! Alan, this is Julie.
Nice to meet you.
The pleasure's all mine.
Come on, all aboard.
- I'll ride in front.
- Arnold, in the back with me.
Come on, get in!
We've got to stop by the hotel
to pick up the bags.
Hold tight.
Here, this is island I'm going to.
It's about 100 miles from the coast.
Well, we could include it
in ourtrip.
It's weird that there's no
ferry service though.
No, it's not weird at all.
It's practically uninhabited
off season.
The families are self-sufficient.
It's only full of tourists in Summer.
Believe me, it's a paradise.
- How do you get there?
- By boat or by hitching a ride.
I was delayed and arrived late.
- Or I'd have left with my friends.
- But then we wouldn't have met.
Sure.
Are going there or not?
Let's vote on it.
Those in favour raise their hands.
- Yes!
- Okay then, let's go!
I can wait to get onboard the boat.
- How long will it take?
- Two days.
- Is that everyone?
- Yes, let's go!
Come on. We're all here.
Move over a little, please.
Give me the bag.
It's this way.
Come on!
Don't worry, darling, it's normal.
I feel a bit nauseous too.
Here.
- Fantastic, isn't it?
- Yes, wonderful.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
- He's already hit on you, eh?
- I think so.
I'm flattered,
he's a really nice guy.
I like Carol too,
and she's crazy about him.
Don't be too flattered.
He tries it on with all the girls.
- What have you got against him?
- Actually, I think it's fun.
The fact is, Carol's my sister.
- Want to take overthe helm?
- Yes, sure.
Keep an eye on the compass
and change course
if the needle moves.
Easier said than done.
- Well done.
- Thanks.
Here.
This is the past, this is the present
and this is the future.
Forget the past and present,
I already know them.
- Tell me the future.
- What do you want to know?
If it'll be a boy or a girl
and whether it'll be happy.
I want to know all about my kid.
Put your right hand
on the cards.
Now choose three
and turn them over.
There.
Now turn over another
with your right hand.
Well?
Carol,
are you going to tell me or not?
Are you under a spell?
What do they say?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
Sometimes they're not clear.
They don't always
say something.
I don't understand what they mean,
I can't see a thing here.
Everything just looks muddled,
it's never happened to me before.
I think we ought to do them
anothertime.
Well, I think they're very clear.
The two knights are the two men
in your life.
One's Arnold and the other's
the baby, so it'll be a boy.
The sun is a positive sign
of strength and security.
And it'll protect the two knights
fortheirwhole lives.
As forthe night, it signifies
peace and tranquillity.
- And so...
- It's time to eat.
If someone knows
where the can opener got to.
I'll give him a hand
orwe'll never eat.
Don't think you're getting away
with that, we'll carry on later.
I'd better go
and give them a hand too.
Thanks, you found a way
of keeping Maggie calm.
Why did you stop?
Because the cards didn't answer.
I believe in the cards
and when they're not clear
I can't make up lies.
If the cards didn't answer,
why are you so worried?
If you ask the cards about
the future and they don't answer,
it means there's no future for
the person who asked the question.
Are you coming to eat?
- Good morning!
- Hi.
Maggie's still sleeping.
The island's not far off now, is it?
If the wind keeps up,
we'll be there in a couple of hours.
- Want one?
- No, thanks.
Are your friends waiting for you?
Sure, but to tell you the truth,
they're not really friends.
They're a French couple
with a 15 year old daughter.
I keep the daughter company
and they give me a free holiday.
What do you do in winter?
Study languages at university.
Then in my free time I work
for a private TV channel.
- What do you do?
- Study medicine.
Two more exams and I've finished.
And the cruises and easy life
will finish too.
- Did you fall out with Carol?
- No, why?
It's weird, when I woke up this
morning she was already up and about.
She said we shouldn't have
let you come with us.
Anyway she begged me not
to debark on the island.
I couldn't get anotherword
out of her.
But don't worry, she was even moody
when she was a kid.
It's the fault of those damned cards,
we could never get them off her.
She can't help it.
- Be careful here.
- You were right, it's a paradise.
- Why don't we stay here a while?
- It's worth thinking about.
- Where's the village?
- Just overthat ridge.
Okay, we'll come with you.
Everybody off.
This way!
Come on, Maggie. Take it easy.
Watch out!
My ankle!
I must have sprained it.
That's all I needed!
I don't think I can come with you.
- I'm sorry.
- What a shame.
Soak your foot in salt water,
then it won't swell up.
- Want me to stay here with you?
- It's okay, you can go too.
Bye, Maggie. Thanks.
Bye Julie. Have a nice stay.
Come on, Carol!
- Need anything, Maggie?
- No, thanks.
- It's weird, though.
- What?
- I don't see my friends' boat.
- It'll be moored somewhere else.
There must be another jetty.
Well, there wasn't two years ago,
as far as I know.
They'll have built another
in the meantime.
Right!
There was a strong current
as we got nearto the island.
I heard my friends talk about it.
It's very erratic.
Sometimes it pushes towards land,
sometimes out to sea.
That'll be because of the tide.
More than likely.
Last time I even risked my life.
The current dragged me out to sea,
I couldn't get back.
- It seems like a ghost town.
- Right.
Julie told us
it was peaceful here.
Is anyone here?
- There's not a living soul here.
- What about the church?
Could be.
There's only one church here,
next to the cemetery.
But it's deconsecrated.
Let's take a look round.
Carol, come on.
Let's look in the general store.
There's a telegraph,
but it's in bad shape.
I'd say it was put out of action
on purpose.
Aren't there any 'phones here?
There are no lines to the mainland.
It's the only means of communication.
Look here.
The last telegram was sent
on June 7th.
More than a month ago.
You know, there's something fishy
about this whole thing!
Hey! Jumpy, aren't we?
Got to the bottom of the mystery?
- Where are the others?
- Trying to find somebody.
Daniel, let's go back.
Look...
A woman.
So, there is someone here.
Let's go take a look.
Excuse us...
May we come in?
Is anyone here?
Why doesn't she answer?
The window!
Look!
Go away.
There she is.
Come on, she's trying
to give us the slip.
Do you mind
changing the water?
It looks like it's been eaten.
Nothing, they've vanished
into thin air.
- Let's go back to the boat.
- Maggie's alone!
Stop!
What're you doing?
Are you crazy?
- They're drifting!
- You'd never make it!
Maggie's onboard!
Calm down!
There must be a storm brewing
so he's going downwind.
Yes, that must be it. The boat will
be back tomorrow morning.
It's almost night, we can't do
anything. We've got to stay calm.
You're right, it's getting dark.
Let's look for somewhere
to spend the night.
We can go to my friends' house.
They'll put us up.
- Is this all their stuff?
- Yes, but they've vanished.
It's like a nightmare.
What could've happened?
I don't know.
Any hypothesis
just seems absurd right now.
Maybe they left in a hurry.
But no one would leave without
taking at least something.
Unless they were in total panic,
terrified.
Maybe an epidemic broke out,
a deadly virus.
No such virus exists
and then we'd have found bodies,
right?
Perhaps that woman Daniel saw
knows what happened.
Maybe she'll turn up again.
She'd have got in touch by now
if she wanted to.
I don't think
she'll show herself again.
Even if she tried to scare us
with that horrible thing.
She succeeded,
even if it was too late.
Hey there! Hello!
How romantic!
Want to eat in your room orwill you
be coming to the restaurant?
Service is included.
- Anyone still hungry?
- No, thanks.
Arnold should eat something.
I made him drink a bottle of wine,
it's betterthat he sleeps.
Poor Maggie.
We should look for her.
Maybe she was already on land.
There'd be no point!
How can you say that?
I can feel it.
Like I felt we shouldn't have come
to this island.
But you didn't listen to me.
I had this feeling
right from the start.
But we still came ashore anyway.
Now it's too late.
There's something evil
on this island.
Something that won't
let us leave.
Something with an inhuman,
diabolical strength.
I can feel its vibrations in the air.
Vibrations with a horrifying power!
Lt'll destroy us!
Lt'll destroy us like it did
all the others!
Cut it out!
Tomorrow morning
we've got to look for Maggie.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Now we'd better get some sleep,
there're two bedrooms.
- I suggest we all sleep in here.
- Yeah.
We can make ourselves comfortable
on the sofas.
I heard it too, let's go look.
Look, the piano!
I'm here!
Come here!
Help me! Let's take him upstairs.
Henriette!
It's Julie, do you remember me?
Calm down, it's all over now.
Ouch! Be careful.
Shut up, it's not serious.
She didn't get any vital organs,
but it is a nasty cut.
Boil some water, clean the wound
and dress it.
- How is she?
- Not too good.
She's badly shaken up.
Who knows how long
she was down there?
She's the daughter of my friends.
You didn't tell me she was blind.
It happened when she was five,
after a car accident.
- How's Daniel?
- It's nothing serious.
I'm just worried about infection.
I want to go into the village
and get antibiotics from the store.
- What, now?
- Yeah, it's better.
Arnold will come with me.
Can you hear me?
What happened in the village?
What happened
to your mother and father?
I don't know, but they're scared.
- What of?
- I don't know.
I call them, but they don't answer.
Mum!
Dad, where are you?
There's no one left.
No one left!
Just him...
I can sense it when he's near.
I can smell him.
Only I can smell it.
I can sense when he's near,
I can smell him.
Who? What can you smell?
Blood.
He smells of blood.
Calm down, sweetie.
It's all over, you needn't be afraid.
We're here now.
We're here.
- Is it too tight?
- No, it's fine. Thanks.
- Now try to get some sleep.
- Okay.
Where's Julie?
Upstairs, with the girl.
They should be overthere.
- Got them.
- Let's go.
Want one?
Thanks.
- Does it hurt?
- No, it's just a scratch.
- You should get some rest.
- I preferto keep you company.
When will this storm end?
The rain's already stopped,
but the air's full of electricity.
- You're scared, aren't you?
- Yeah.
But you don't show it,
you're wonderful.
You're a really special girl.
I don't know
if you've noticed that...
- No, I don't think this is right.
- Why, because of Carol?
You're wrong. Between me and Carol
there's only an old friendship.
I'm not interested in your
personal situation.
Okay, you may not be interested,
but I want to tell you anyway.
Maybe Carol's in love with me,
but she can never give me
what I'm looking for.
What do you want in a woman
that's so special?
I don't know how to describe it,
but I'm sure that I'd find
what I'm looking forwith you.
Damn you!
It's all your fault!
Everything that's happening!
It's all your fault!
Damn you, I'll make you pay!
Listen, I...
- Where's that idiot going?
- Wait, I'll go.
What are you doing?
Open up!
Open the gate!
Where are you going?
What happened?
- Carol ran off.
- Where to?
I don't know. She locked me
in the cemetery and split.
- Maybe she went back to the house.
- Let's go.
What is it, little one?
What's wrong?
He's here!
He's close by, I can smell him.
Calm down. I'm here.
Calm down, I'll lock the door.
Daniel, where are you?
Little one!
What's the matter? Move it!
There's no point. They're dead.
They're all dead.
Carol was right,
this place is cursed.
That monsterwill kill us all,
me too.
Don't talk crap.
The curse, the monster,
it's all bullshit!
Okay, Daniel was killed by a bite
from a human.
We can't deny that, but maybe it's
the work of some poor lunatic.
Maybe we can kill him
before he kills us.
But we can't abandon
Maggie and Carol.
Dead or alive,
we've got to find them.
Let's go.
Come on!
Who could this place belong to?
The Vortmans. I've never met them,
but it must be theirs.
Klaus Vortman was in the papers
a few months ago.
His yacht was wrecked off the coast
of the island.
He disappeared with his wife
and son.
Any surviving family members?
Careful.
I think there's a sister. They said
she went crazy afterthe accident.
They were very close.
Careful.
The Vortmans were masters
of the island.
They established themselves here
almost a century ago.
Let's take a look upstairs.
Come on.
My God!
Cut the rope, quick!
Who could it be?
Maybe it's Ruth, Vortman's sister.
Come here!
Come on, Henriette.
Careful.
Answer me, Carol!
What happened?
Daniel's dead, isn't he?
Yes, how do you know?
She told me. Where is she?
She killed herself.
- How did she know?
- I don't know.
She was kind to me,
even though her behaviourwas weird.
Last night, before I went to sleep,
she came to me.
She asked me to forgive her.
Who knows why?
She was upset.
Look!
The boat!
I knew it!
The current's brought it back.
We've got to reach it
before it drifts out to sea again.
Wait here.
- How do you feel?
- A bit groggy.
I think I was given tranquillizers.
- I think we should join the others.
- Yes, let me pull myself together.
I owe you an apology,
I wasn't very nice to you.
Forget it,
it's all in the past.
Why did she kill herself?
I don't know.
Something terrible's going on.
- It's her, right?
- Yes.
This is the brother, his wife and
their son who died in the wreck.
They were a good looking family.
- What is it?
- A notebook.
There's some stuff written in it.
It looks like a diary.
May 12th.
"Today they found the bodies
of two German kids.
The horrific mutilations
have terrified the entire village."
I can't make out anything else,
it's all burnt.
This part's still legible.
"There have been a lot of deaths.
The locals talk about a monster
The tourists are leaving the island,
but he continues to kill.
The police came
but they can't do anything.
I hid the bodies,
so they won't have any proof.
I managed to hide
the entrance to the room."
What does she mean?
We've got to find a way
to reach the boat.
- Let's split up.
- Yeah, you go that way.
I'll go. You stay with Henriette.
Yes.
Come on.
I'll get you out of here.
Go away! Leave us alone!
We've not done anything to you!
Go away! Go away!
Go away!
My wife's pregnant!
She's expecting a child.
My child, our child.
Go away!
No, you can't do it.
It's our son!
He's dead,
now he's only food for survival.
You won't touch him. He's our son!
Eat me, damn you!
Sit down, love.
There, stay calm.
- Julie, where are you?
- I'm here.
It's horrible, Carol.
That man is totally crazy.
Come on. We've got to go, quick!
Careful!
Come on, quick!
- Where are we?
- Be quiet.
Keep down!
Don't die.
