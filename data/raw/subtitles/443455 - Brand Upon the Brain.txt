Guy Maddin, housepainter...
swirling around in his little dreams,
his little memories.
About to return
to his childhood home...
after an absence of 30 years.
Summoned by a letter from his mother,
also not seen in 30 years.
"It is my dying wish...
"that you go back
to our old home at Black Notch...
"and give the lighthouse
two good coats of paint...
"so that I might see it
spruce and proper...
at least once before I pass on. "
"I will come when I'm able,
if I am able.
Signed, Mother. "
The past.
The past.
Into the past.
The deserted Black Notch Island.
The deserted lighthouse.
Site of the old mom-and-pop orphanage
run by Guy's parents.
What distant, distant memories.
Slap a coat of paint on it!
Cover it up. Cover it up, Guy!
Two good coats. Two.
The past.
The past.
The past.
Painting, brooding,
thinking of the past-
of home, of childhood...
of loves lost...
of scattered friends...
of happiness grown cold.
Brooding and painting.
Painting and brooding.
The past!
The past.
The past.
Young Guy, 12 years old...
out at the secret meeting of orphans.
All eyes on Savage Tom...
the oldest orphan on the island...
leading a Black Mass.
Guy's older sister-
always living dangerously.
Sis, always in trouble,
always in trouble.
To bend a young boy's will...
Guy's mother threatens daily
to sell the island.
Guy, heir to his father's island
and orphanage.
And the threats gnaw like worms
in the lad's bosom.
"I, too, am an orphan.
"My mother, I am told,
was very beautiful...
"but completely bald.
"Her sister had superb hair
but was barren of womb.
"The two girls
were so jealous of each other...
"of what the other had-
hair, a baby-
"they didn't waste words.
"Their hatred spilled over
into bloody violence.
"Knives were never far from hand.
"One was scalped
for her beautiful hair...
the other one stabbed into the stomach
to get at that baby. "
"From my mother's womb untimely ripped...
"I was carved from my mother's belly.
"Now my mother and aunt are buried
in the silt of the lagoon...
"next to each other...
disgraced, forgotten. "
The sights, the sounds...
the feel of Guy's beloved island.
While the orphans toil at their chores...
young Guy is free
to wander his island...
free to indulge himself,
free to remember.
Free to remember.
So many secret spots to revisit.
And out gush the torrents of memory.
Everything that happens
will happen again, twice.
"The first time
I will just see something...
"smell it or taste it...
"but it won't stick.
"I know there will come again
someday...
a second chance
to really feel these things really. "
One day, Guy's solitary practices
received a spectacular, disruptive jolt-
the sudden appearance
upon his familiar island of a celebrity.
Is it?
Is it?
It's Wendy Hale, the sister half
of sibling teen detectives...
known around the world
to readers of crime stories...
as the Lightbulb Kids.
With her brother, Chance Hale,
these two intrepid sleuths...
have earned far-flung fame...
for both their harp playing
and their crime solving.
"I am here on Black Notch Island...
"to work on the case
of The Face in the Lighthouse.
"Seems many of the children
adopted out of this orphanage...
have very suspicious holes
pierced into the back of their heads. "
"Oh, Wendy."
Shh. Secrets.
Secrets.
Shh.
Secrets are always told in whispers.
Guy, always on the run-
running to please.
Secrets.
Secrets.
Secrets.
"Mother!"
Invented by Guy's father...
the aerophone allows
two people who love each other...
to communicate
over great distances...
merely by speaking into or bending an ear
toward the horn.
The signal is strongest
when the feelings are running high...
when the communicants
are deeply in love...
but also during outbursts
of extreme fury.
In other instances,
the signal is either weak or nonexistent.
And so, Mother has given little aerophones
to her two children...
in order to tell them she loves them
and to keep them out of trouble.
Just one of the fantastic devices
invented by Guy's father.
It seems Neddie
once threw his little brother's toy...
into a powerful transformer...
never expecting the toddler
would retrieve it.
The little one was fried to an ash...
and Neddie has been
ticking and twitching ever since.
"A nd both my mother and I
have identical birthmarks over our womb...
"as if a knife had cut us open too.
"Isn't that creepy?
It looks like Rumania, doesn't it?"
"Rumania! Rumania! Rumania!"
Charms just asking to be enjoyed.
Wendy decides that she can pursue
her interests on Black Notch Island...
much better as a boy...
so she quickly disguises herself
as her own brother-
Chance Hale, teen detective.
Chance explains that Wendy was called
back home on a secret business...
and that he, Chance, would be
taking over the Black Notch investigations.
"Oh, Wendy."
The detective gets down to work.
Chance is gathering all the evidence.
Guy, smitten again.
This time, Chance is the dazzling one.
"Oh, Chance. Chance."
Hero and role model.
"Chance-all to myself."
Chance thinks differently than the other boys.
Mother used suicide threats
as her primary teaching aid.
She kept orphans and offspring alike
in line with colorful bluffs.
Chance has this theory,
and his theories are always right.
Mother and Father are criminals.
Chance says so.
"If only I could remember...
"the exact order
of the places I've touched...
"Just before I found Wendy.
Wendy. Wendy. "
Everything happens twice. Twice.
Now!
Fearing that Sis will touch him...
and discover his secret identity
as a girl...
Chance devises a strategy
of the kissing gloves.
"Only the wearer
of these nifty little items...
is allowed to do any touching, "
claims Chance.
Ah! Sweet gloves.
"Stop! Look at your hair!"
"I really love goats."
"Guy's mom says they're devils
because their pupils are square. "
"I think they are lonely."
Chance wants Sis,
and Sis wants Chance.
Can it last?
Both Guy and Sis
are crazy about Chance.
Guy pines for Wendy...
but loves every second spent
with his new hero, Chance.
The secret touches between Chance and Sis...
and the secret touches yet to come.
The kissing gloves
now the undressing gloves.
Mother is determined to age backwards.
To become a little girl again.
Even a baby-
a complete innocent.
She's even set aside
a cradle in her room...
for when the day of infancy
finally returns.
"Your father is so overworked.
I will always be there for him. "
Secrets are hard things to keep secret.
Now!
Ah. Sweet gloves.
Always embarrassed by being out with Mother.
Holding hands.
What happens behind the door...
is secret.
Secret.
Secret.
I wish there was a little keyhole
that I could look through.
"F-Day.
"A II questions about Father
will be answered tonight.
"A II mysteries solved anon!
"I'll force the issue.
Mother will have me
in Father's lab faster than" -
Rage!
Frequent rage!
Rage ages one!
Rage ages all!
"Oh! Oh!"
It takes the weight of many orphans...
to keep Father's casket in the earth.
#Mother's gone #
# We're orphans #
# Orphan angels now #
# Her heavenly charge #
# Pennies paid #
# For water's passage #
# Burdens we no more ##
What's a suicide attempt without a wedding?
So much for suicide!
Plan "B"!
Rumania! Rumania! Rumania! Rumania!
"Oh."
Relief.
Cursed relief.
Fevers.
Chills.
Sleepwalking.
Down in the dorms...
a voodoo restlessness prevails
after the resurrection of Father.
"Go! Go! Go! Out! Out! Run!
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!"
"Everyone's playing hooky!
Everyone's running, running!"
Three's a crowd on honeymoons.
Guy banished.
