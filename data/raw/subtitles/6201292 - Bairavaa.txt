Previously on "Designated Survivor"...
Looks like the House is gonna
pass the gun-control bill.
Speaker Hookstraten came through.
Now, I may be new to the
Hill, but so is everybody else.
You're the last of the old
guard around here, Madam Speaker.
So get on board... or step aside.
There is a connection
between MacLeish and Lozano.
And this FBI Agent,
Hannah Wells, was onto it.
You're interested in Nestor Lozano.
So are we.
You got my attention.
Someone is feeding Abe
Leonard classified information,
and we need to find out who.
This is a manifesto, Jason.
"Pax Americana... An American empire
to replace our own
constitutional government."
Oh, my God.
It's Lozano.
It can't be.
Lozano's dead.
Let me see that.

Tree line!
Go, go, go!
Don't let them get away!
Shoot them!
Oh, forget this.
I thought we said
11:00. It's almost 2:00.
Just testing your resolve.
Three whole hours... is that
all the truth is worth to you?
Is that what you're
gonna give me, the truth?
Tip I gave you on Hannah
Wells paid off, didn't it?
All right, what do you got for me now?
Another piece of the puzzle.
Why not the whole thing?
That's not how this works.
I'm not on the record here.
You need to find the story yourself,
and I need to know I can trust you.
You got to be kidding me.
I've never burned a source in my life.
I lost my job at the Herald
'cause I wouldn't give up my sources.
The White House is
covering up the truth.
Truth about what?
The Capitol bombing.
Hannah Wells' boss was the last person
to see Majid Nassar alive.
Jason Atwood... Check him out.
Wait, wait.
How the hell is Lozano still alive?
Jason, are you hit?
- Oh, God.
- I got to get you to a hospital.
No, it can wait.
Damn it.

Today marks a milestone for
the Kirkman Administration
as he signs his
gun-control bill into law,
igniting hopes that this
unelected, independent president
can actually break the partisan gridlock
that's paralyzed Congress for years.
There's another big winner today...
Speaker of the House Hookstraten,
the moderate Republican
who went out on a limb
supporting the White House on this.
These two have got to be
feeling good this morning.
Madam Speaker,
this could not have been
accomplished without you.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
I don't think my hand
has shaken this much
since I signed my first mortgage.
No dice.
What do you mean?
The plate's from a White
House pool of vehicles.
White House? You're sure?
That's what it says.
I need to get a name.
Hundreds of people work there.
Any one of them could have accessed it.
Hey, I paid you to get a name.
You paid me to run a plate.
Oh, come on.
Wh...
I should at least get a discount!
White House.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey, hey! Big win today!
Yeah, for all of us.
Yeah, we're trending... #GunControlWins.
We, uh... We get you back in
the West Wing with the new VP?
Ask her.
What is it?
No comment.
No comment necessary.
The speaker swung the vote for POTUS,
creating a true bipartisan alliance.
No. Tri-partisan alliance.
You had Democrats, moderate
Republicans, and Independents.
I stand corrected... A
true tri-partisan alliance.
Now, who wouldn't
want to keep that going
with Hookstraten as VP?
Well, the polls are
in. America wants this.
And the president will make
up his mind when he's ready.
Yeah, but what's your opinion, really?
Hookstraten said she'd
deliver the vote, and she did.
That's it?
You find that evasive?
I find that evasive.
Absolutely.
That's evasive. I
want a straight answer.
Look, we all know that the relationship
between POTUS and the Speaker
hasn't always been easy.
He's a consensus builder,
and she's a...
Hey, watch it.
Bulldog is what I was gonna say.
That's fair.
Yeah, but Kirkman needs a bulldog,
especially one who controls
a majority in the House.
He needs allies, but he also
needs someone he can trust.
Mm, so you're saying you don't
find her to be trustworthy.
Okay, what is this? A press conference?
I am enjoying being on the other side
of the podium for once.
Of course you are.
All I'm saying is
that she's a politician
and he's not.
Well, opposites attract.
Sometimes.
I have to be honest...
When I first took
office, I had my doubts.
I didn't know if I could trust you,
and I knew you didn't trust me.
I trusted you were doing your best.
I believe that.
Well, let's just say you
didn't have a lot of faith
in what my best could be.
Oh, you were an unknown
quantity, Mr. President.
I just wanted to make sure the
best interests of the country
were being protected.
I know.
I hope I passed the test.
I hope I did.
We have a lot of momentum
right now.
Together, as a team, we managed to cross
the bipartisan divide for the bill.
You did your job
quickly and efficiently.
I was really impressed.
I have sharp elbows
when I'm fighting for
something I believe in.
Well, we can certainly
use your sharp elbows
when rolling out our
new legislative agenda.
But, Kimble... well, I
think we've got a chance
to do something really special here...
Beyond policy.
I would like my daughter to see a woman
become vice president
of the United States.
Sir...
so would I.
Good.
We'll start the formal vetting process.
As soon as you clear that,
we'll make a public statement.
I'm excited for both of us.
Thank you, sir.
No, thank you. Come on.
Today's legislation deals a serious blow
to Senator Jack Bowman,
who clearly underestimated
the president's ability
to build a successful coalition
in the House of Representatives.
Senator, Liam Price to see you.
Send him in.
Thanks for seeing me, Senator.
I-I know what a busy schedule you have.
May I also say how much
I admired your stance
on the gun-control bill.
You said you have something for me?
Close the door.
And you're sure it was him?
Yeah, it was him.
From one sighting, at 130 yards out,
through a night-vision scope?
I know what I saw. Atwood saw him, too.
Where is Atwood?
He's recovering. He
took a round in his arm.
What about Lozano? Did
you track the helicopter?
Tail number was blacked out.
And there's no FAA airtraffic
control in the area.
It's like he flew into a vacuum.
Did we secure the munitions, at least?
Yeah, the task force was on the ground
two hours after Hannah called it in.
They secured the silo,
but everyone was gone.
So, if Lozano's alive, then
who did the FBI take down
after the attempt on the president?
Here's your boy.
Crime report said he
was holding a grenade.
What did the shrapnel tell you?
That he was less than three
feet away before he threw it.
So it was intentional.
Either that, or he was shot
before he could throw it.
How'd you I.D. him?
Prints on the left hand were intact.
Lower mandible, too. Did the trick.
Do you mind if I get a
set of prints for myself?
Knock yourself out.
Aaron Shore.
It's Dan Pyne from Politico.
Hey, Dan. What's going on?
We're going with a story
about Speaker Hookstraten.
Wanted to give you guys
a chance to comment.
Okay, well, what's the story?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Did you see what just hit Politico?
No.
This is bad, right?
No, this is really bad.
_
- Hey.
- Hey. You heard?
Yeah, Aaron gave me a heads-up.
Mr. President.
Thank you, Ava.
Am I missing something here?
Because as far as I can tell,
Kimble took a trip to Turkey
during her first year in Congress,
six months later, co-signed a bill
providing them with
further military assistance.
Turkey's been a member
of NATO since 1952,
so this is pretty standard practice.
What's the big deal?
It's the optics, sir.
It appears as though
she's accepting gifts
in return for military favors.
I don't care about the optics.
There's no sign of malfeasance here.
No, sir, but it's implied.
And this is a town that
loves to connect the dots.
She stayed in hotel suites
in Ankara and Istanbul
and had lavish meals.
What was she supposed to
do, check herself into a cell
and survive on bread and water?
The military-aid package
included the latest
in digital-surveillance technology.
And, at the time, the Pentagon
was strongly advising against
giving it to Turkey.
It was a controversial measure.
It only passed by four votes.
Everyone on that trip
voted in favor of it.
Circumstantial at best.
When can I talk to her?
- I'll set it up.
- Okay.
Thank you both.
Mike, what is it?
It's about Nestor Lozano.
Sir, there's a possibility
that he's alive.
What?
How is that even possible?
Agent Wells thinks she
spotted him in North Dakota.
If she's right, who did the FBI kill?
Wells and Foerstel... They're
investigating that now.
As a precaution, we're
gonna switch up your schedule
and run more decoy motorcades.
I'm not worried about me.
What about Alex and the kids?
We're doing the same at Camp David,
along with increased perimeter security.
Sir, they won't even notice.
Okay. Thank you, Mike.
Thank you, sir.
No, that's good. That sounds
like a win-win for everybody.
Senator Bowman.
Now, listen, you let me know
when you have Goodman on board.
We'll see what we can do about
pushing it out of committee.
Now, if this has something
to do with your new boss,
I have nothing to say.
She didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, then there's nothing for
her to worry about, is there?
Yeah, except you can't
un-ring a bell, Senator.
Now, we both know an accusation
is just as bad as a conviction.
I-I'm sorry. I'm having a
really hard time understanding
what any of this has to do with me.
What, you're saying it's a coincidence
that right when she beats
you on the gun-control bill
that this hits Politico?
You're not White House Chief
of Staff anymore, Shore.
I'd watch your mouth.
Nobody from my office gave
that story to Politico.
And you expect me to believe that?
I don't give a damn what you believe.
It's a match.
Yeah, but the body in
the morgue isn't Lozano's.
There's enough left of
his face to tell that.
But there's a positive
I.D. Who screwed up?
No one did.
Fingerprints and dental records matched.
Someone hacked the IAFIS database.
They switched Lozano's
records with the dead man's.
You realize what you're saying?
The clearance level it
would take to pull that off.
Well, we've known for a while
that someone in the White House
made Kirkman designated survivor.
Yeah, we thought it was someone
who probably died in
the Capitol bombing.
I think it's time that we consider
that this person may still be active.
You know, how it works at the Bureau.
I can't say anything about
the death of Majid Nassar.
It's an open investigation.
All right, but you know
Deputy Director Atwood, right?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Well, what does that mean?
Means I haven't seen him in a while.
What, he's not there anymore?
- I didn't say that.
- Well, you implied it.
No, I didn't.
What, was he canned? Is that it?
You're a disgrace, you know that?
You're worse than Atwood.
Whoa, whoa. Wait. What a
minute. What does that mean?
Don't call me anymore.
What does that mean?
Just a couple more. Thank you.
Okay, great.
Gentlemen, I want to
thank you for your service.
And I promise, we will
look at the numbers
for those body cameras
as soon as possible.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you. Gentlemen.
Sir, Speaker Hookstraten.
Great. Madam Speaker.
Mr. President.
Well, this afternoon
took a turn, didn't it?
Yes, sir. Please.
Thank you.
I just wanted to assure
you that the trip I took
and the bill I co-sponsored
were completely unrelated.
Kimble, I believe you.
The trip was largely agricultural...
Drip irrigation, things like that.
I thought it would be
useful for my constituents.
And the bill?
I co-sponsored it with
Representative Holden of Ohio,
former Chair of the
Armed Services Committee.
I've heard he was a good man.
He was my mentor.
And he believed the aid
package was necessary
to protect American personnel
at Incirlik Air Base.
And a majority of Congress
agreed with him, as it turned out.
Well, just tell people
what you just told me.
You have a ton of supporters.
It's a whole new
ballgame out there, sir.
The new Senate is like the
old Senate... conventional.
They were all appointed to
replace their predecessors.
But the House... they were
all elected, and they're young.
Youngest House in U.S. history.
And I'm old guard, sir.
They don't see me as
their legitimate Speaker.
I got here the same way
you did... by surviving.
Well, that's not fair or true.
You were elected. You were
a serving Congresswoman.
Besides, if they wanted to replace you,
they could have done it a while ago.
They were finding their feet.
And now they have their
excuse to replace me.
Because of Senator Bowman.
He's denying it, but who
benefits most from this?
I'm his biggest rival in the party.
Son of a bitch.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
What is it?
I thought you would both want to hear...
The House Ethics
Committee just announced
that they are opening an
investigation into the Speaker.
Jay Whitaker, Homeland Security Adviser.
Thank you for meeting me.
I put together that video you asked for.
We were able to
reconstruct Lozano's path
from the PLC Building
where the assassination
attempt took place
to the Annapolis facility
where he was taken down.
This is Lozano exiting the PLC Building.
This is the camera that
covers the main entrance.
This camera covers the side,
and you see him walking there.
He walks two blocks
north to Union Station.
Then we got him on camera
passing an ATM machine.
Next we pick him up
in the parking garage
where he jacked the minivan.
We have the minivan on
constant camera surveillance
all the way out of the city.
- It's all on the flash drive.
- Good.
Here's where Maryland State Police
spot him entering Annapolis.
A unit attempts to pull him over,
which leads to a high-speed pursuit.
But Lozano manages to elude them.
Then he flees on foot into
the marine-storage facility.
At this point, Maryland State Police
set up a perimeter and
wait for the FBI to show up.
This is how that plays out.
And that flash, is that
the grenade going off?
Yes. At first we thought he was
shot before he could throw it,
but the coroner's
report was inconclusive.
He may have detonated it deliberately.
From what I've read,
Lozano was a total soldier.
Well, this is very
impressive. Thank you.
It's all on here, including
the highway cams, as I said.
This is gonna help us a lot with
the rest of our investigation.
I'm just glad we caught
the son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Me too.
Hey, Dan.
Shore.
Nice smear job.
Give me a break.
I called you for a comment.
Yeah, and you buried it
under four graphs of innuendo.
Look, I-I want to see
both sides of the story.
And the Speaker's willing to
sit with you... an exclusive.
I already reported that
she denies any wrongdoing.
Yeah, but... But it's not the same
as letting her tell
her side to the story.
Well, she can tell the Ethics Committee.
Hey, you could at least give her
the same platform you gave to Bowman.
Look, I didn't give Bowman anything.
And for your information,
there's lots of people
gunning for your boss.
In the latest scandal to hit Washington,
the House Ethics Committee
has opened an investigation
into Speaker of the House Hookstraten
for alleged improprieties
involving a military-aid
package to Turkey 12 years ago.
Thank God we didn't go
public with your choice.
Maybe we should.
No. Sir, this is not
the time to double down.
We need to cut her loose now.
Kimble told me she
didn't do anything wrong,
and I believe her.
If you nominate her at this point,
you will destroy all
of the political capital
we've worked so hard to gain.
I don't believe that's necessarily true.
We can take our case
to the American people.
But, sir, your battle isn't
with the American people,
it's with Congress.
And you'll lose.
I'm sorry.
She's the right choice,
and I'm not gonna back down.
Okay.
I'll stay in contact with Aaron,
get a sense of where things
stand with the Committee.
I also want Seth to start
working on a press release.
I want to remind the American people
of what we've just accomplished here,
and let them know that
Speaker Hookstraten
is our bridge across
that bipartisan divide.
What about finding a
surrogate to author an op-ed?
That's a good idea.
Let's see what names
we can attach to it.
- We'll do everything we can.
- Thank you.
The reservation's in your name.
The ambassador's a fan of Riesling,
so I had them put aside a
bottle of '14 Emmerich Knoll.
All right. What about that tweet?
"If these allegations prove true,
it will be a damn shame
for Speaker Hookstraten
and the country."
Good. Send it.
Just make sure not to comment
on the investigation, per Se.
Did you see Bowman's latest tweet?
Oh, yeah, pretty transparent.
Now, the release... We
need to talk about...
Yeah, I got it. Uh, just a
general statement of support
for a woman with a long record
of outstanding service to the country.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Yeah, that's why I'm
the press secretary.
I'll push it out to
the briefingroom list.
Okay, just make sure it's
the first thing they read.
And the op-ed?
Yeah, uh, let me write it first,
then we can see who we
can drum up to sign it.
Swing big, okay?
He really wants this to happen.
Yep.
Jason Atwood, right?
Abe Leonard, New York
Standard. You got a minute?
Nope.
What happened?
Don't tell me it was
from a shaving accident.
Hey, I'm not looking for trouble.
I just got a few questions
about Majid Nassar.
Excuse me. Can I have the check, please?
Right away, sir.
You were Acting Deputy
Director of the FBI,
lead investigator on the
Capitol bombing, right?
Here you go.
Come on. That's public record.
I'm just trying to find
out what happened next.
Why'd they fire you?
I resigned.
Well, a White House
source tells me different.
This have anything to do with your son?
Don't you ever talk about my son.
Okay, all right.
I'm sorry. I'm just trying...
First you're leading the
bombing investigation,
then you see Nassar die
the day he's in custody,
then your son gets kidnapped.
Ow.
I told you... Don't mention my son.
Ah, my bad.
I just want to know what
happened to Majid Nassar.
Are you a good guy or a bad guy?
Got it. Thanks, John.
House Ethics Committee.
They want to see me tomorrow.
That was fast.
They're like a firing squad.
Yep.
How did it go?
Well, it didn't come from Bowman.
In that case, I might have a good idea
where it did come from.
Who?
I want to check it out first.
It's funny... yesterday, I was
talking about the vice presidency,
and today, I'm fighting
for my political life.
How the hell did he know
I was at the prison
when Nassar got killed?
There has to be a leak, Hannah.
Leonard said he has a
source at the White House.
Oh, we're looking into it... Believe me.
We just have to be really careful.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Stay at home while all this goes down?
Look, I need to help.
- You can't.
- What do you mean I can't?
You... You can't.
You can't shoot a gun.
You can't even drive a car.
I need you to heal right now, Jason.
Go and find somewhere
to stay off the grid.
- Like, go hide somewhere?
- Look, I don't hide.
I cannot be worrying about you
when all of this is going on.
- You don't have to worry about me.
- But I do.
You need backup.
I'm gonna go it alone for now.
- What?
- It's better than widening our circle.
Look, Jason...
I know it's hard for
you to take a back seat.
You got to trust me. It's gonna be okay.
You remember your first
time going through a door?
You think I forgot East Baltimore?
And you almost threw up in the hallway.
I think I did... a little.
You saw me and you told me to calm down.
You said everything was gonna be okay.
I'm gonna trust you.
Hey. I love the op-ed piece.
Oh, thanks. You want
to put your name on it?
Problems?
I sent it to six people.
They all said "no."
Really?
I thought that being able to take credit
for a piece of your writing
would be incentive enough.
I'm serious.
It's not the quality of the piece.
It's that nobody wants to stick
their necks out for a dead duck.
It's that bad, huh?
Look, not to mix metaphors,
but there's blood in the water, Emily.
The people I've sent this to know that.
Okay. Well, keep trying.
Yeah. Big swings, right?
Exactly.
Liam Price to see you.
Thank you, Kristie. Send him in.
Come on in, Mr. Price.
Speaker Hookstraten.
Liam.
How long has it been?
So, you figured it out.
It wasn't that hard.
I thought, "Who worked
for me 12 years ago
that'd want to stab
me in the back today?"
You fired me.
You were taking money from lobbyists.
And if I recall, I didn't fire you,
I gave you the chance to resign.
Well, now you will
have that same option.
Oh.
So, let me guess... you've
been to Bowman's office.
He'll never make it to the White House.
We'll see.
I should've gone public
with you 12 years ago, Liam,
fed you to the wolves.
Too late now.
Not really.
I still have the evidence
against you, Liam.
And now... Senator Bowman does, too.
You know, I doubt any
presidential hopeful
would want anything to do
with a lying,
unscrupulous punk like you.
You can go now, Liam.
It is very convincing
when you first look at it.
Here is Lozano, supposedly
leaving the PLC Building
after the assassination attempt,
but look... His face is always down,
away from the surveillance
cameras, right?
His back is turned. His collar's up.
Now, look at the street.
- Same deal.
- Mm.
Could be Lozano, but who knows?
Now, the parking garage.
We're on his back the whole time.
It's like he knows
where the cameras are.
Exactly.
And the next time we
get a good look at him...
he's crossing from the car
to the storage facility.
Right. There's no way to tell.
Right.
So, when did they make the switch?
Here is the footage from the
PLC Building after the shooting.
And now this is the next morning,
20 hours and 17 minutes after that.
Long after the building
has been cleared,
long after the suspect
has been shot dead...
someone leaves the building.
Would you like me to zoom in?
Please.
Lozano never left the building that day.
He waited till the coast was clear.
He left the next day.
So, it's true?
Lozano is alive, sir.
And Agent Wells is absolutely positive?
Yes, sir.
The man the FBI killed was a decoy
and was willing to sacrifice
his life to help Lozano escape.
Sacrifice his life for what?
And why?
How many more of them are out there?
Good news?
We got a hit on the dead guy's
prints... Desmond Legarth.
ATF picked him up in 2005
on a gun-possession charge.
I just sent you the file.
This guy fell off the
grid six years ago.
Before that, he was Army Infantry.
His last known employment was
a small-arms instructor for...
Browning Reed.
Financial forensics did
a full work-up on him.
He took out a loan for
his mother's house in 2003.
You know who co-signed that loan?
The C.E.O. of Browning Reed.
Patrick Lloyd?
Yeah.
I'll be back.
Where you going?
Where are we at with the op-ed?
Whose names are attached?
Reagan Whithorne, sir.
Former one-term
congressman from Arkansas.
That's it? Who's rolling it out?
The Sentinel.
Oh.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
It's the best we could do.
It's not your fault.
It's a good piece of writing, Seth.
Thank you.
What's the word from Aaron?
Speaker Hookstraten appears before
the Ethics Committee tomorrow.
They're gonna go after her hard.
Looks like she was right
about the younger generation
wanting to replace her.
That's the information I have, also.
It may not be possible to save her.
You know what? To hell with it.
Run the op-ed now.
Yes, sir.
I'm good. Thanks.
Long time.
I've been busy.
I've noticed.
So, why are you looking
for Patrick Lloyd?
It's a two-way street.
You want Intel from the Agency,
I get Intel from the Bureau.
Beck...
I've never denied you anything
when you've asked for it.
You don't need to know
why I'm looking for Lloyd.
I met him a few times... Scary dude.
Spent 16 years in Special Forces,
completed more classified missions
than anyone in his unit.
In 2000, he inherited a fortune
from his father's business,
put it all into Browning Reed.
Okay.
After 9/11, he won over $2 billion
in government
contracts... Super patriot.
A friend to politicians and generals...
Until things went south.
Yeah, I heard... Scandals and lawsuits.
Company went under.
Yeah, but not because
he couldn't afford it,
because he felt betrayed
by his own government.
He turned.
Since he dissolved the company,
Lloyd's become a political player.
He started behind the scenes,
but now he's making more
public appearances now.
Very big on the alt-right circuit,
but he makes those
guys look like liberals.
Scary thing is,
he's got the IQ and the
money to back up his views.
So where do we find him?
He's been hiding in plain
sight the whole time.
There he is.
Oh, we have visitors.
Will you take that for
me, please? Thank you.
Hey, there.
FBI or, uh, Homeland?
What gave us away?
Oh, shoes, the walk...
the fact that federal agents
raided a piece of property that
was owned by my former company
a few nights ago... Take your pick.
FBI.
Ah.
I'm Agent Foerstel. This is Agent Wells.
So, how about we talk about that silo?
And the munitions you
were keeping there.
Certainly.
They are Russian-made land
mines, 300,000 of them,
flooded the market after Russia
pulled out of Afghanistan.
Browning Reed bought them, legally,
and used them for our Demining training.
My attorney has all the
import permits on file.
Here's his card. Hmm.
Though, I expect he'll
contact you first,
once he's pulled together the charges
for the illegal search and seizure.
What about Desmond Legarth?
Who's that?
You bought his mother a house.
You don't remember his name?
Well, if I did that,
then I assume he must
have worked for me.
I gave loans to hundreds of
my employees over the years,
most of them veterans, ignored
by the country they served.
See, I won't ignore them,
and I won't fail our
ancestors by allowing America
to become a broken system of oppression.
It...
What did Mr. Legarth do?
He's a person of interest
in an ongoing investigation.
Well, you must be searching in the dark
if you're talking to me.
Well, we're not reading
tea leaves, Mr. Lloyd.
Fact is, Browning Reed keeps coming up
in connection to our case.
Browning Reed no longer exists.
Uh, yet they still hold titles
to properties and munitions.
Liquidating a billion-dollar business
takes time, Agent Foerstel.
It's something that someone
on a government salary
might have trouble understanding.
If you want to talk again,
please feel free to contact my attorney.
Charming.
What?
"We have failed our ancestors
by allowing America to become
a broken system of oppression.
It is our job to take back
America from the corrupt leaders
who seek to take our land and money."
Everything he's
saying... It's all there.
Go home. It's late.
Hey, did you put eyes on Lloyd?
Yes, 24/7.
And I'm betting he's
very well aware of it.
It's fine. Maybe it'll slow him down.
Look...
If you're right, i-if
he's the guy behind this,
it's gonna be just like MacLeish.
Knowing and proving are
two very different things.
And Lloyd is 10 times more dangerous.
He is protected in every way...
Physically, financially, legally.
No one is above the law.
Yes, I get that, but it's
gonna be very difficult
to catch him with dirty hands.
We're gonna have to work our way
through his whole organization.
His organization?
What organization?
I was down there in North Dakota.
I saw them. They vanished.
They're everywhere and nowhere.
They're the waitress at the
restaurant down the road.
They're your accountant.
We're...
We're not gonna flush them out.
Okay, look, we'll hit this
again in the morning, okay?
You need to get some rest. Go home.
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm in no rush to get
back to the fleabag motel.
Get some rest.
I will.
Okay.
Hey, Jason. It's me.
Hey. What's going on?
Look, I know I told you to lay low,
but I need your help.
Name it. What do you need?
Patrick Lloyd.
Hello?
Little pea, how are you?
Hey, Daddy.
I miss you.
I miss you more than
anything in the world.
Me too.
Where is Mommy?
Upstairs, helping Leo with his homework.
Want me to go get her?
No.
No, I want to talk to you.
Okay.
Did you have fun with your tutor today?
Yeah. She lets me watch the news.
I saw you on the TV.
You did?
They said you might pick that
lady as your vice president.
The one you gave the pen to.
Did you know she'd be the
first girl vice president?
Yeah, I did.
You think that's cool?
Yeah.
Me too.
Over here.
That's far enough.
What did you learn?
Well, Atwood was fired.
Some agents are calling him a disgrace.
And what does that tell you?
I don't know.
But it's got something
to do with Majid Nassar.
Check the White House log for
the day after Nassar was killed.
The White House log?
I'm leaving now.
Don't follow me.
Well...
Yeah?
How'd it go?
Clockwork.
Good.
We're back on track.
