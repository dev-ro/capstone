[Flamenco-Style Guitar Intro]
[Pop, Up-Tempo]
Our glorious city
Was built by the divinities
By gods who saw fit
To bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below
And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago
El Dorado
El Dorado
El Dora-a-a-a-do
-Today, we sail...
-[Nickers]
to conquer the New World...

[Whinnying]
[Grunts]
Altivo, eyes forward.
-Seven!
-All right!
-Yes!
-Partner! Hee-hee!
-Tons of gold for you
-Hey!
-Tons of gold for me
-Hey!
-[Both] Tons of gold for we
-Hey!
-One more roll!
-[Plucks Notes]
Uh, guys, you're broke!
-You got nothin' to bet with!
-Oh, yeah? I got this!
-[Man]A map!
-A map?
-A map!
A map of the wonders
of the New World.
-Wow! Let's have a look.
-[Scoffs]
[Indistinct Muttering]
Uh, Tulio!
-Excuse us, for one moment, please.
-Tulio, look!
-El Dorado, the city of gold.
-[Sighs]
This could be our destiny, our fate.
Miguel, if I believed in fate,
I wouldn't be playing
with loaded dice.
-Hmmm. [Chuckling]
-Not with the face. No, no, no, no, no.
-No! No! No!
-[Whimpering, Panting]
I said one more roll!
My map against your cash.
-Hmm?
-[Dice Clattering]
-All right, peewee. You're on!
-Not with those!
This time we use my dice.
Ehh, got a problem with that?
[Whimpers] No.
[Whispers]
I'm going to kill you.
Come on, baby.
Papa needs that crappy map.
[Giggles]
-[Scoffs]
-[Blows]
Stop that!
Show me seven!
[Gasps]
[Crowd Exclaims, Cheers]
-Seven!
-All right!
-Seven!
-[Groans]
[Laughing] There it is!
Well, nice doing business with you.
-[Grunting] I knew it!
-[Crowd Gasping]
[Gasps]
Your dice are loaded!
What?
You gave me loaded dice?
[Grunts]
-He gave me loaded dice!
-[Crowd Murmurs]
-Guard, arrest him!
-You dare to impugn my honor?
He was the one who was cheating!
Arrest him! He tricked these sailors
and took their money!
-Oh, now, I'm the thief?
-Yes.
Take a look in the mirror, pal!
Oh, you better give them
that money back, or I'll--
-En garde!
-En garde, yourself.
I will give you the honor
of a quick and painless death.
But not with that. Ha!
I prefer to fight fairly. Aha!
-[Growls]
-Well, any last words?
I will cut you to ribbons,
-fool!
-Such mediocrity.
Let your sword do the talking.
-I will.
It will be loquacious to a fault!
-Ha! Take that!
[Both Grunting]
-You... mincing, fencing, twit.
-Ah, you fight like my sister.
I fought your sister.
That's a compliment.
-Braggart!
-Heathen!
-[Man] Kill him!
-Not the face. Not the face.
[All Gasping, Clamoring]
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've decided it's a draw.
[Miguel]
Thank you all for coming.
-You've been great. See you soon.
-Adios!
-Congratulations. You're very good.
-No. That was good.
-Very--
-[Snort]
-[Gasping]
-[Mooing, Snorting]
-We should have kept
our swords, I think.
-Y-Yeah.
-[Snorting]
-[Tulio Whispering]
Yeah, I've got a plan.
-What is it?
-Uh, well-Uh, you...
-pet him, and... I'll...
-Yeah.
run!
-Uh, well, thanks a lot!
-[Bull Bellowing]
[Both] Whoa!
-There they are!
-[Hooves Screeching]
[Male Chorus]Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
-[Woman Screaming]
-Bye. Thank you!
-[All Gasping]
-[Bellowing]
[Chorus] Olé
[Groans]
[Fabric Ripping]
[Both Grunting]
-Uhh--
-Ohh--
-I'll bet we can make that.
-[Men Shouting]
-[Guard] There they are!
-Two pesetas says we can't.
You're on!
[Both Yelling]
-[Miguel] You lose!
-[Coins Jingling]
-[Miguel]Ohhh!
-[Tulio] Whoa! What's happening here?
We're both in barrels.
That's the extent of my knowledge.
[Muffled Grunts, Groans]
Okay, Miguel,
we gotta move fast.
-On three, we jump out
and head for the dock.
-Good. Good. Excellent.
[Together]
One, two, three--
-[Both Grunting] Th-Three!
-[Creaking]
-[Both Straining] Three! Ohh!
-[Creaking Continues]
[Straining]
Three!
[Tulio]Uh, you ready?
Ah, okay. One more. Let's go.
[Together]
One, two, three!
-[Fly Buzzing]
-[Wind Whistling]
-Excuse us.
-Okay. We're outta here.
-Who ordered the, uh, pickles?
-[Sailor Laughing]
[Grunting]
Cortes!
-My crew was as carefully chosen
as the disciples of Christ.
-[Cracks Knuckles]
-And I will not tolerate stowaways.
-[Gulps]
You will be flogged.
And when we put into Cuba to resupply,
God willing, you will
be flogged some more...
and then enslaved
on the sugar plantations...
for the rest of your miserable lives.
To the brig.
All right!
Cuba!
-[Gasps]
-[Gasps]
[Whistling]
-[Chuckles]
-[Nickers]
Hey, Altivo!
Ah-ta-ta, not for you!
You're on half rations.
Orders from Cortes.
-[Gasps]
-[Banging]
[Banging Continues]
So, uh, how's the--
How's the escape plan coming?
All right.
All right. Wait!
-I'm getting something.
-Yeah.
Okay!
Here's the plan.
-In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions,
-Mm-hm.
hijack one of those long boats,
and then we row back to Spain
like there's no mañana!
-Back to Spain, yeah?
-Yeah.
-In a rowboat.
-You got it!
Great. Sensational.
And that-that's your plan, is it?
-That's pretty much it.
-Well, I like it.
-So, how do we get on deck?
-Umm.
In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions,
-hijack one of those longboats--
-Uh, great.
Okay, what's your idea, smart guy?
Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Don't ask
me that! You're the one with the plans.
-[Horse Whinnying]
- Wait, I-I have an idea.
Uh, come on. Give me--
Give me a boost.
Hey, Altivo.
Altivo.
You want a nice apple?
Come and get it.
-[Hooves Clattering]
-You have to do a trick for me first.
Huh?
[Sputtering]
All you have to do
is find a pry bar.
A long piece of iron
with a hooky thing at the end. Yeah?
-Miguel, you're talking to a horse!
-[Hooves Clattering]
That's it, Altivo,
find the pry bar.
-Yes, find the prybar.
-[Whinnying]
-He can't understand "pry bar."
-[Clattering Continues]
He's a dumb horse.
There's no way--
[Whinnying]
Well, it's not a pry bar.
-[Wind Howling]
-[Ship Creaking]
-[Gasps]
-[Nickers]
Oh, Altivo.
Oh, thank you, old boy.
Listen, if we can
ever return the favor--
For Pete's sake, Miguel,
he's a ruthless warhorse, not a poodle.
Come on,
before he licks you to death.
-Adios.
-[Whinnies]
Shh, shh. Shh.
Quiet, please.
-What's the matter with him?
-Oh, he wants his apple.
-Well, give it to him
before he wakes the whole ship!
-[Bellowing]
-Fetch!
-[Whinnying] Huh?
[Snoring]
[Gasps]
Hmm?
[Hoof beats Clatter, Stop Abruptly]
-Huh?
-Huh?
-[Whinnying]
[Whinnying]
-Altivo!
-Huh? Miguel!
[Yelling]
-Altivo, I'm coming!
-Miguel!
Just hang on!
I'm right here, old boy!
-Have you lost your mind?
-Help is coming!
[Gasps]
Ho-o-ly ship!
[Miguel, Tulio] Whoa!
[All Gasping]
-Loop the rope under the horse!
-Yes!
On the count of three,
pull back on the rope.
-What? [Gasps]
-Three!
-[Tulio] Pull!
-[Grunting]
Tulio!
Hey, it worked!
Did any of the supplies make it?
-Well, uh, yes and no.
-[Crunching Sound]
Ohhh, great!
Look on the positive side.
At least things can't get--
Excuse me.
Were you going to say "worse"?
-No. No.
-No? You're sure?
-Absolutely not.
I've revised the whole thing.
-Okay, because--
-[Tulio] Yeah,
we're at least in a rowboat.
-We're in a rowboat, exactly.
[Miguel]
You miss nothing.
[Grunting, Groaning]
-[Grunting, Groaning Continue]
-[Whinnying]
[Yelling]
-[Groaning]
-[Gasps]
[Together] Ahh!
[Coughs]
[Smacking Lips]
[All Sobbing]
Tulio, did you ever imagine
it would end like this?
-The horse is a surprise.
-[Nickers]
Any... regrets?
Besides dying?
Yeah.
I never... had enough... gold.
My regret, besides dying, is...
our greatest adventure
is over before it began,
and no one will even remember us.
Well, if it's
any consolation, Miguel,
you... made my life...
an adventure.
[Sobbing]
And if it's any consolation,
Tulio, [Sniffles]
-you made my life... rich.
-[Sobbing Continues]
[Scoffs, Sputters]
[Both Sobbing]
[Shuddering Gasp]
[Moans]
-[Gasps] Is it?
-Hmm. [Gasps]
It is! It's-It's--
It's-It's-It's--
[Both] It's land!
-[Both Screaming]
-[Whinnying]
All in favor of getting back
in the boat, say "aye."
-Aye!
-Aye! Go!
-[Nickers]
Hey, Miguel!
I could use a little help!
Miguel!
Hello!
Tulio!
We've done it!
-What's that? The map?
-It's all right here!
You still have the map?
The whistling rock!
The stream!
You kept the map, but you couldn't grab
a little more food?
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:
It could be possible.
And it is!
It really is... the map to El Dorado!
[Panting]
-You drank seawater, didn't you?
-Oh, come on!
I'm not coming on!
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle
for a million pesetas!
-How about a hundred million?
-What?
I just thought that, after all,
since El Dorado is the city of gold--
-What's your point?
-You know, dust, nuggets, bricks,
a temple of gold where you can
pluck gold from the very walls.
But you don't want to go, so let's...
get back into the boat
and row back to Spain.
-After all, it worked so well last time.
-[Gibberish] Wait!
Mmm. Wait a minute.
New plan.
We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,
-and then we go back to Spain.
-And buy Spain!
-Yeah!
-That's the spirit!
-Come on, Tulio.
We'll follow that trail!
-What trail?
The trail that we blaze!
[Nickers]
That trail that we blaze!
-[Mutters]
-[Whinnies]
Oh, no, you don't.
Yeow! Your horse
bit me in the butt!
-[Chittering]
-[Hissing]
Look out new world
Here we come
-Brave, intrepid
-Charge!
And then some
Pioneers of maximum audacity
Whose résumés show
that we are just the team
-To live where others merely dream
-What are you looking at?
-Building up our head of steam
-Whoa!
On the trail we blaze
[Chorus Vocalizing]
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Chorus] On the trail
On the trail we blaze
-Dinner is served.
-Hello.
Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la
The promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold a child
On the trail we blaze
[Chorus Vocalizing]
[Chorus]
On the trail we blaze
The trail we blaze
Is road uncharted
Through terra incognita
to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be fainthearted
We are part
of a sumptuous grand design
Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
[Creaking, Crackling]
-On the trail we blaze
-[Yelling]
[Yelling Continues]
[All Grunting]
[Groaning]
Hmm.
-[Snaps Fingers]
Miguel. Miguel, wake up.
-[Moans]
-We're there. Oh, yeah. We found it.
-We found it? Oh!
Fantastic!
Where is it? How far?
-Right here! Here.
-Where? Behind the rock?
-No, no. This is it.
-[Stammering]
Give me that!
This ca-What?
-Apparently, "El Dorado" is
native for...
-[Muttering]
"great, big... rock"!
[Echoing]
Hey, but I tell you what, I'm feeling
generous, so you can have my share!
You don't think Cortes could've
gotten here before us and--
And what?
Taken all the really big rocks?
-The scoundrel!
-Tulio, you--
We have to think about this.
We've come all this way,
-and we-we-we should really, you know--
-Get... on...
the horse!
[Sighs]
No, no, no, not with the face.
Stop.
[Clears Throat] Looks like
there's a pass right over there.
[Panting] Ohh!
[Panting Continues]
-[Grunting, Gasps]
-[Whinnying]
-[Men Shouting]
-[Both Gasping]
-[Both] Hyah!
-[Whinnying]
-[All Gasping]
-[Snorting]
[Gasping, Grunting]
[Chuckles] I've--
Uh, hello. Is this your rock?
Sorry. We were just looking.
We're, uh--
We're tourists!
Tourist.
-[Clears Throat]
-We-We lost our group. May we go now?
-[Gasps]
-[Chuckles] Spears.
[Grunts]
[Nickers]
[Chittering]
Hey! Hey!
-[Chittering]
-[Bird Calling]
[Bird Calling Continues]
[Sighs Dejectedly]
[Whistling]
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
Oh, my--
[Miguel]
It's-It's--[Gasps]
[Both Whispering]
El Dorado.
-[Giggling]
-Oh!
[Chittering]
-[Chuckling]
-[Children Giggling]
[Whispering]
[Chanting]
[Whispering]
Mmm. Ah!
[Chattering]
[Sighs] Well, it was nice
working with you, partner.
Tulio, I just want you to know...
I'm sorry about
that girl in Barcelona.
-So-You-You, f--
-[Man]Behold!
As the prophesies foretold,
the time of judgment is now!
[Both Gasping]
Citizens, did I not predict
that the gods would come to us?
Hmm.
[Chuckling]
My lords, I am Tzekel-Kan,
your devoted high priest
and speaker for the gods.
Hey.
I am Chief Tannabok.
What names may we call you?
-Huh? I am Miguel.
-[Murmuring]
-And I am Tulio.
-[Murmuring Continues]
And they call us Miguel and Tulio!
[Tzekel-Kan] Your arrival
has been greatly anticipated.
My lords, how long
will you be staying in El Dorado?
-[Whimpering]
-Aha! I see you've captured
this temple-robbing thief.
-How would you have us punish her?
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
My lord, I am not a thief.
See, the gods sent me a vision...
to bring them tribute
from the temple to guide them here.
My only wish is to serve the gods.
-Release her, don't ya think?
-[Villagers Gasp]
-[Grunts]
-Then you will begin
by returning this...
to its rightful place.
[Chittering]
-My lords, why now
do you choose to visit us?
-[Scoffs]
Enough!
You do not question... the gods!
That's right!
Do not question us,
or we shall have to unleash
our awesome and terrible power!
And you don't want that!
-Well, yes! We do!
-You do?
Of course we do!
Visit your wrath upon this nonbeliever!
Show us the truth
of your divinity!
-Divinity! One moment.
-[Chuckles]
Miguel, you know
that little voice people have...
that tells them to quit
when they're ahead?
-You don't have one!
-Well, I'm sorry. I got carried away!
-Way away!
-Maybe we should tell
the truth and beg for mercy.
Are you nuts?
We'd be butchered alive!
Yes, but they're getting suspicious.
-And if we don't come up
with so me mega-cosmic event--
-[Rumbling]
-[Altivo Whinnying]
-[Chittering]
I'm trying! I'm trying! I can't think
with all these distractions!
-You-Horse--
-Think horse. Think, think, think.
I'm on the verge of--
Stop! [Echoing]
[Coughing Sound]
-[Gasps]
-[Gasps]
[Crickets Chirping]
[Villagers Chanting]
-[Chanting Continues]
-Don't make me start it up again,
'cause I will.
[Chanting Continues]
O mighty lords!
Come.
Let me show you to your temple.
All right!
Temple.
Step aside.
[Villagers Murmuring]
[Panting]
[Grunting]
[Panting Continues]
[Sputters]
To commemorate your arrival,
I propose a reverent ceremony at dawn.
Ah, then perhaps I could prepare
a glorious feast for you tonight.
Which would you prefer?
-Both.
-Both.
-[Together] Both.
Both is good.
-My lords.
-My lords.
And so dawns the Age of the Jaguar.
Happy New Year.
[Chuckles]
-Hey!
-Hey. Hey.
-[Laughing]
-[Laughing]
[Whinnying]
Tulio. Tulio.
They actually think we're gods.
-[Tulio]
It's an entire city of suckers.
-[Miguel Laughing]
We just have to keep
this up long enough...
to load up on the gold
and then get the hell out of here!
Tulio, we'll be living like kings!
-Miguel and Tulio!
-Tulio and Miguel!
-Mighty and powerful gods.
-Gods.
-Hello.
-[Both Gasping, Whimpering]
-[Laughing]
-Depart, mortal,
-before we strike you
with a lightning bolt.
-Mmm. Mmmm!
[Humming]
Beware the wrath of the gods! Begone!
[Clicking Sound]
Save it for the high priest, honey.
You're gonna need it.
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel, it's not working.
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel! We've been caught.
Oh, no.
Don't worry about me, boys.
"My only wish is to serve the gods."
Remember?
-How?
-Well, if you guys want the gold,
then you don't want
to get caught, right?
-You're going to need my help.
-[Scoffs] What makes you
think we need your help?
-"Ck-ck." Are you serious?
-[Whinnies]
I-What-We--
Okay. So, uh, who are you?
-Yeah, uh, what's your angle?
-[Laughs] No angle.
-I want in.
-In?
-On the scam.
-[Chuckles]
There's no scam!
Why would you think there's a--
-Why?
-So I can get out.
I thought she just said she wanted in?
She wants in so she can get out.
Aha! Got it.
[Chuckles]
-W-Why?
-Think you're the only ones
who dream of better things?
Of adventure?
You've got your reasons,
and I've got mine.
Let's not make it personal, okay?
-It's just business.
-[Both] Oh.
So when you guys
are ready to go back to...
wherever you came from,
-I'm going with you.
-[Laughs]
No!
Don't think so.
[Coughs]
-[Whistling]
-All right. Fine.
After all, I'm sure you know...
the proper rituals
for blessing a tribute,
the holiest days on the calendar--
Oh, and of course you know
all about Xibalba.
[Chuckles]
Okay? Good luck.
-See you at the execution.
-[Gibberish]
Wait! Ho--
Would you-Hold it.
-[Chuckles] Deal?
-Hmm.
-Deal.
-Not yet.
Let's just see how this works out.
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose that means
you'll want these back?
-How'd you get those?
-Where was she keeping them?
-Call me, Chel, your new partner.
-Uh,
-that's partner-in-training.
-[Humming]
Now, put these on.
Your public's waiting.
[Continues]
-[Chel Giggling]
-Do you mind?
No.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Giggles]
Right. Uh, excuse me.
-[Grunting]
-Bye.
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call
this place "Chel Dorado."
[Chuckles]
She's whoo--
-Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
-What?
The little voice--
Remember the little voice?
Ju-Ju-Just for a second
imagine that you have one.
What would it be saying about Chel?
-[Purrs]
-No. No. Listen.
-We are partners.
-We are partners.
-We have a plan, remember?
-Get the gold. Go back to Spain.
Yes! And we are
pretending to be gods.
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?
-Listen carefully.
-[Gasps]
-Chel is off-limits, hmm?
-Bravo! Chel is off-limits!
Shake on it.
-Off-limits. Mm. Mm.
-[Both] Mmmm.
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.
We must avoid
giving in to temptation.
-Gods. Oh. This is
gonna be tougher than I thought.
-Tulio, relax!
All you have to do is smile,
act godly and follow my lead.
[Gasps]
[Gasps] Big smile.
Like you mean it.
A-one, two, three.
I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it
with the cherubim
-[Groaning]
-Tulio, what are you talking about?
There again they're on their knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
Which rather suits us in
-The interim
-Interim, interim
It's me and him
Oh, my God!
It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a rather touching notion
All those prayers and those salaams
And who am I to bridle
If I'm forced to be an idol
If they say that I'm a god
That's what I am
What's more if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes
I can see us being sacrificed
-Or stuffed
-You have a point there.
Very good thinking.
-So let's be gods
The perks are great
-Yeah!
-El Dorado on our plates
-Thank you.
Local feelings should not
-Be rebuffed
-Never rebuffed
I never rebuff a local feeling
No, my friend
It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings
Yeah, keep 'em sweet
-That's our advice
-It's great advice!
Be a symbol of perfection
Be a legend
Be a cult
Take their praise
Take a collection
As the multitudes exalt
Don a supernatural habit
-We'd be crazy not to grab it
-You got it!
So sign on two new gods
For paradise
Par-a-dise
-[Continues]
-[Chattering, Laughing]
-[Screeching]
-[Drunken Whinnying]
[Fades, Ends]
[Both Snoring, Mumbling]
-[Metallic Clattering]
-[Both Gasping]
Good morning, my lords!
-He's back!
-Oh, no.
And now it's my turn!
-The gods have awakened!
-[Cheering]
Whoa!
[Groans]
Mm-hmm.
-[Grunts]
-[Whimpering]
-Hey, Chel, what's going on?
-It's not gonna be good.
Thank you.
This city has been granted
a great blessing.
And what have we done
to show our gratitude?
A meager celebration.
-The gods deserve a proper tribute!
-[Crowd Gasping]
-Hmm.
-Hmm.
The beginning of a new era,
the dawning of a new age...
demands...
sacrifice!
-[All Gasping]
-[Gasps]
-I don't like this.
-Tulio, we've got to do something.
[Groans]
-[Groaning]
-[Yells]
[Tulio]Stop!
Hmm?
-This is not a proper tribute!
-[Moaning]
-[Crowd Gasps]
-You do not want the tribute?
No. No, no.
W-We want tribute.
Uh, it's just that, uh--
Tulio, tell him.
The stars are not in position
for this tribute!
Like he says, the stars--
Can't do it.
Not today.
Ah.
Perhaps it is possible
I misread... the heavens.
-Don't worry about it.
To err is human, to forgive--
-Hmm.
My lords, may the people of El Dorado
offer you our tribute.
[Crowd Gasping]
[Gasps]
[Gasping Continues]
My lords, does this please you?
-[Sighs]
-Yes, very nice.
-Certainly acceptable.
-Yes, lovely. It'll do.
The gods have chosen!
To Xibalba?
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-No. No.
[Together] To Xibalba!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-Oh, great.
[Cheering Continues]
Hey, Chel, um,
what are they doing?
They're sending it to Xibalba,
the spirit world.
-The spirit world.
-I'll take care of it.
[Clears Throat]
Um, excuse me, Chief.
The gods have changed their minds
about Xibalba.
They wish to bask in the reverence
that has been shown them.
Stop!
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-They wish to bask!
Take the tribute to the gods' temple!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Humming]
Nice going.
[Chuckles]
Smile while you can.
Well, well, well,
what have we here?
[Evil Chuckle]
-[Tulio]Ai-ai-ai.
-Tons of gold for you, hah
-And tons of gold for me, hoo
-[Together]
Tons of gold for we, ah
-Not bad for a day's work, eh?
-Not bad at all.
We just became richer
than the king of Spain. [Laughing]
You know, speaking of kings, the chief
and high priest seem a bit, uh, tense.
Buenos días!
Listen, all we have to do...
is keep playing
the one against the other.
You know, do a little god dance,
chant some mystic mumbo jumbo,
dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors
and then get the hell back to Spain.
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna
get all this back to Spain?
Ummm--
-A boat?
-[Tulio] Yeah.
Um, we really hate
to be ascending so soon,
but, uh, some urgent business
has come up--
-family matters-and it's just a bit--
-Yeah, family.
Badda-bing, budda-boom,
you know what I mean.
Oh, we expected you
to be staying with us...
for the next...
thousand years.
Well, as we say
in the spirit world,
-there's your plan and then...
there's the gods' plan.
-Mm-hmm.
And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,
'cause we're gonna ascend...
-kind of in
a horizontal pattern at first.
-[Chuckles]
And then we're gonna go vertical,
uh, as we get further out to sea.
Hmm. To build a boat
large and glorious enough...
would take... about a week.
-A week? Hmm.
-Um--
I wonder how long it would take
Tzekel-Kan to do it.
But-But for the gods,
uh, three days.
Uh--
Well, if that's the best you can do.
Oh, perhaps if you were not burdened
with so much tribute,
you could leave sooner.
-Hmm?
-Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?
Yep, yep.
Three days is just fine.
-[Tulio]No, three days is not fine.
-[Chel Humming]
-This is a real--
-Mmm.
-these-these are the ones-problem.
-Oh. Thank you.
-Miguel, how are we gonna
keep this up for three days?
-[Yawns]
You worry too much.
No, I worry exactly the right amount.
You can never worry too much.
We just have to lie low.
But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's--
No! Don't even move!
-Tulio--
-You're moving!
-A little, but-Come on.
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-[Stammering] Stay!
-I gotta-I--
-[Groans]Just... stand there!
-I just--
For three days?
-[Clatter]
-Yes! Exactly.
For three days.
Don't even breathe. All right?
All right.
We lie low.
No, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Promise?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.
Great! Good. Okay.
-Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to gloat over my gold.
-[Giggling]
[Kissing]
Oh, yum, yum, yum.
[Kissing Continues]
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah!
-You know, you really shouldn't miss it.
-I know.
But I-I couldn't.
Go ahead.
I'll cover for you.
-Oh, good. Thanks.
-[Tulio Singing, Indistinct]
-So, what happened to Altivo?
-I don't know.
Tulio goes for paradise
-Hey, what happened to Miguel?
-I don't know.
Oh, my God! He's gone!
Miguel's gone!
He's loose!
What am I gonna do?
Oh, no, no!
[Sobbing]
Oh, Miguel is right.
You worry too much.
[Groaning]
Oh. Ooh.
[Moans]
-Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, down, down, down.
-[Humming]
-No! No! Big trouble.
-[Gasps]
[Chuckling] Whoa!
Look, sweetheart,
we're in the middle of a con here,
walking the razor's edge.
On the one hand, gold!
On the other hand,
painful, agonizing failure!
[Clears Throat] I can't afford
any tempta-uh, distractions.
So, I'm sorry.
So sorry.
[Sharp Inhale] But perhaps
another time? Another place, hmm?
[Chuckles]
Too bad. I'm free now.
I'm... not really sure
I trust you.
Mmm, I'm not really
asking you to trust me.
-Am I?
-Whoo.
'Kay.
[Moans]
Ooh, yeah.
[Chirping]
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
Hey, where is everybody?
They've been cleared
from the streets, my lord,
so the city can be cleansed,
as you ordered.
-Cleansed?
-Yes.
So the Age of the Jaguar can begin,
-as you ordered, my lord.
-[Man]Get back in!
-Where are you going?
-Hey, stop that!
-[Guard]Move!
-Hey, stop that!
What are you doing?
Stop that!
But, my lord,
anyone who disobeys your orders...
must be punished, as you ordered.
It seems I've been giving
a lot of orders, haven't I?
Tzekel-Kan has made
your commands clear, my lord.
Really?
-Here's an order: Take the day off.
-Huh?
-Are you all right?
-[Panting]
-Here.
-[Whimpers]
Oh, no!
It's all right. Please.
[Random Notes]
[Tuning]
[Continues]
-[Whinnies]
-Hey, Altivo. There you are.
-[Gasps]
-[Strums]
[Playing A Tune]
-Oh.
-Oh.
[Both Chuckling]
[Murmuring]
[Continues]
The more I learn
The more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart
The roving eye
Have come to rest
Do not apply
The frantic chase
The crazy ride
The thrill has gone
I step aside
I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me by just existing
Only this is true
I love you
I love you
Without question
I love you
I'd believe in anything
Were it not for you
Showing me by just existing
Only this is true
Oh, I love you
[Chuckles]
[All Chuckling]
[Whinnies]
Hmm. This is not what I expected.
Perhaps Lord Tulio will enlighten me.
[Chuckling]
How do I look?
Oh, uh-Well, you--
Oh, shut up.
-[Tulio Gasps]Oh! Whoa!
-[Chel Humming]
-[Tzekel-Kan]My lord?
-[Gasps]
-Hello?
-The high priest.
-Ow!
[Gasps] What's he gonna think if he
finds one of the gods like this with me?
Uh, lucky god?
J-Just-Just-Just--
[Groans]
-Hello?
-Whoa!
Oh, Tzekel-Kan!
-What brings you here?
-I-I-I-I-I humbly request
an audience with you, my lord.
-Yes, what can I do for you?
-My lord, I have just seen
Lord Miguel out among the people.
-Really?
-If I may be so bold as to
offer some advice.
-All right. Shoot.
-[Clears Throat]
My lord, you are perfect.
[Chuckles]
Oh, well. Go on.
But in your perfection, you cannot know
how imperfect humans are.
-Like snakes they are.
Spineless and slippery.
-[Hissing]
They are as untrustworthy as rats,
stealing and cheating with no remorse.
Spinning webs of lies, like spiders!
Stop it!
That's disgusting.
They're beyond disgusting!
-Yeah, yeah, way beyond.
-Then we're in agreement.
I'll begin the necessary
preparations immediately.
Do you wish to have
your victims bound to an altar,
or would you prefer them free-range?
-[Mutters]
-And will you be devouring
their essence whole...
or piece by piece?
Tzekel, you've lost me.
My lord, these people will not
respect you if they do not fear you.
And, of course, we'll make them
fear us by--
A sacrifice, as it is prophesied
-The history of the Age
of the Jaguar will be written in--
-Ink?
-Blood!
-Blood! Oh, right.
Of course. I should probably
consult with Lord Miguel.
This is fairly important stuff.
I, um, should discuss the entire, uh,
blood issue right away.
Excuse us, won't you?
Let's go.
[Chuckles]
Finally... we're connecting.
[Horse Whinnies]
[Nickering]
This way.
-[Chief Laughing]
-[Chuckling, Panting]
[Grunts]
-What do you think you're doing?
-[Chuckles] Lying low.
[Grunts]
Look, change of plans.
-We have to grab what we can carry
and get out of here now!
-What? Why?
Because the high priest is nuts!
He wants--
-This is unacceptable!
-Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.
The gods should not
be playing ball like this!
-Well, exactly!
-This is how the gods should play ball!
-[Cheering]
-[Horn Sounding]
-Well, don't blame me.
-I blame you.
What is the object of this game,
pray tell?
You've gotta knock the ball
through the hoop.
-What hoop?
-That hoop.
-[Cheering Continues]
-That's impossible.
-We're gonna lose.
-Gods don't lose.
[Rumbling]
[Men] Heep-ha!
My lords, Chief Tannabok's warriors are
the finest ballplayers in the city.
-[Grunting, Gargling]
-Fifteen mere mortals against two gods.
[Both Gulp]
-I realize it's a bit uneven,
-[Warriors] Heep-ha!
but I do hope they'll challenge you
enough to make the game... interesting.
-Play ball!
-[Crowd Cheering]
Crush them into the dust.
[Chuckles]
-Enjoy.
-[Crowd Chanting]Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
-[Rumbling]
-[Chanting, Cheering Continue]
-[Yells]
-[Gasps]
-D'oh. D'oh.
-[Murmuring]
[All Grunting]
My lords,
were you not supposed
to put the ball into play?
Ohh!
[Chuckles]
Well, no, no, no, no, no--
We were merely demonstrating
the, um, traditional, uh,
first avoidance maneuver.
Ah.
I've never heard
of such a thing.
Excuse me.
Who invented this game?
-Why, the gods, [Chuckles] of course.
-[Chuckles]
I'm warning you,
don't push your luck with this guy.
But, Tulio, we're the gods.
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Grunts]
Tulio!
The hip! The hip!
[Groans]
-[Panting] This is impossible.
-[Grunts]
-[Cheering]
-[Groaning]
-[Horn Sounds]
-Excuse me?
-Heep--
-Haaa!
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!
[Both Groan]
-[Warriors Chanting]
-[Footsteps Rumbling]
[Chel]
Foul! That was a foul!
[Chanting Continues]
-[Squeaks]
-[Gasps]
[Warrior]
New ball!
[Both Panting]
How long does this go on anyway?
The game is over
when the shadow touches this line.
-We need a miracle.
-No, we need to cheat.
-[Warriors Shouting]
-[Crowd Cheering]
[Chittering]
-[Both] Yes!
-[Horn Sounding]
-[Both] Huh?
-[All Grunting]
Hey!
-[Laughing]
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Both] Olé!
-[Crowd Chanting, Indistinct]
-[All] Huh?
-[Women Cheering]
-Hmm.
Yes! [Laughs]
-Who's the god?
-You de god.
-No, you the god. Fine.
-No, you de god.
[Giggling]
Y-Yeah! Yeah!
[Coughs]
Guys, it's here!
It's right here with me!
-[Both Gasp]
-[Altivo Whinnies]
[Gasping]
-[All Gasping]
-[Chittering]
Mmm.
[Cheering]
-[Horn Sounding]
-I love this game! [Laughing]
-[Both] Yes!
-[Laughing]
-[Laughing]
-Well done, partner.
-Yes! Yes!
-My lords,
congratulations on your victory.
And now, you will, of course,
wish to have the losing team...
-sacrificed to your glory.
-[Crowd Gasping]
[Groaning]
Not again.
-Look, Tzekel-Kan,
-Uh, Miguel?
-forget the sacrifices.
-Miguel.
We don't want any sacrifices.
But all of the sacred writings
say that you will devour
the wicked and the unrighteous.
Well, I don't see anyone here
who fits that description.
[Scoffs]
Well, as speaker for the gods,
it would be my privilege
to point them out.
The gods are speaking
for themselves now!
This city and these people...
have no need for you anymore!
[Grunts]
There will be no sacrifices!
-Not now, not ever!
-[Crowd Cheering]
-Get out!
-[Gasps]
-[Scoffs]
-[Cheering Continues]
[Gasps]
[Low Growl]
Mmm. As the...
gods... command.
-[Laughing]
-[Crowd Cheering]
Whoa! Who-o-oa!
Hey, not bad for
my first commandment, huh? [Laughs]
Miguel, the little voice--
[Stammers]
Yeah, fine.
Do you know why
the gods demand blood?
-I don't know.
-[Grunts]
Because gods don't bleed.
It's time to take the future
into my own hands,
and this city will be cleansed.
Even if I have to do it myself.
-Uh, how?
-[Grunts]
There are dark magics here...
and power... and--
Ooh. My, my, my, my, my.
It's not called
the Age of the Jaguar for nothing.
[Snickering]
This'll be a delightful way
to bid the false gods... good-bye.
[Workers Shouting]
Hmm.
-Adios, muchacho!
-[Chuckles]
-[Chuckles, Gasps]
-[Birds Chirping]
[Pleasurable Moan]
[Workers Shouting]
-Well, it's, um, uh, nice.
-Nice?
-Yes, nice.
-But?
Um, but, uh,
is it really fit for the gods?
-My lord.
-[Chuckles]
I have been around boats, believe me,
and that, um--
the pointy, tall, um--
the-the-the-the long
up and down thing--
-The mast?
-The mast, yes, yes. The mast is good.
Well, look at it. [Stammering]
There's not nearly enough, uh,
um, rope.
-Rope?
-Yes, rope. Exactly my point.
Vertical ascension requires
a lot more, uh, rope.
-My lord. [Chuckles]
-And look at this. [Grunting]
[Sighs, Clears Throat]
This doesn't look at all secure.
Chief, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but all
in all, it is a complete do-over.
Hmm.
You know, Lord Miguel,
if you wish to stay,
you only need to say so.
-You mean... forever?
-Of course.
Oh, no, I can't.
I have to go back with Tulio.
We're-We're partners.
Big plans in the other world, huh?
Yep. Big plans.
Well, then,
I better go get some more rope, huh?
Oh, Chief, um,
forget about the rope.
Um, my mistake.
Hey, to err is human.
-[Tulio]Half?.
-Mm-hmm.
[Laughing]
I don't think so.
I-I'll tell you what. Uh, I'll let you
come back to Spain with us,
like you wanted, and, um, yeah,
I can see my way clear to throwing you,
mmm, ten percent?
[Chuckles] You know, maybe I won't go
to Spain with you and take a third.
Ohh! [Chuckling]
Like you don't wanna go to Spain.
Oh, like you don't want me
to want to go to Spain.
-I want you to want... what you want.
-Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm. Go on.
All right.
Cards on the table.
Uh, I want you to come to Spain
with me and Miguel.
Mostly me.
Especially me.
Only me.
Forget Miguel.
[Chuckles] Well, as long as
that's what you want.
-Me too.
-Okay.
Deal?
-Deal. Mmm.
-[Plate Clattering]
[Hoof beats]
[Gasps]
"Forget Miguel"?
[Sniffling]
Well, forget Tulio.
[Nickering]
[Humming]
Well, is it ready yet?
Ooh.
Ah! [Sniffing]
Ahh! Hmm.
-It seems to be missing something.
-[Humming]
Ah, that's it.
-It needs more... body.
-[Grunts]
[Gasping]
[Hysterical Laughter]
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
[Grunting]
-[Growling]
-Do... as I command!
-[Tzekel-Kan Laughing]
-[Jaguar Laughing]
-The gods deserve a proper tribute.
-[Chittering]
-Stop! There will be no sacrifices!
-[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
That kid does you better than you do.
[Sighs]
Some send-off, huh?
We're finally at the "go back to Spain
and live like kings" part.
[Children Laughing]
[Nickers]
Ooh-hoo-hoo.
Well, isn't king
kind of a step down from god?
What? Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Miguel, we can't stay here.
[Chuckling]
We have a plan, remember?
How about... we forget the plan?
Hmm?
-What?
-[Jaguar Roaring]
[Roaring Continues]
[Both Screaming]
[Evil Laughter]
Now everyone will know
the truth of your divinity.
[Shouts]
[Screams]
[Screaming Continues]
I'm okay!
I'm still okay!
Come on! Get on!
[Whinnying]

Hey, over here,
you big Tzekel-Kan cat creep!
-[Growls]
-Altivo, get Chel out of here.
[Whinnying]
-[Roars]
-[Both Yelling]
Duck!
[Roaring]
[Panting, Yelling]
Who-o-o-oa!
[Both Gasping, Yelling]
Move! Move!
-Jump!
-[Roaring]
[Both Yelling]
[Both]
Who-o-o-a!
I know what you are,
and I know what you are not!
And you are not gods!
Y-You're not a god?
You lied to me?
[Clears Throat]
-How dare you!
-Hey, it was his stupid plan!
-What?
-Oh, oh, oh.
My plan was that we should lie low!
But your plan was to run off and be all
"Oh, look at me. Look at me. I'm a god."
-That's not true!
-No? Who are you kidding?
You're buying your own con!
At least I'm not dating mine.
I-Ooh, low blow.
Listen, Mr. High and Mighty,
we'd both be sailing out of here
with a mountain of gold...
-if you had just listened to me!
-[Grunts]
Well, now you've got all
the precious gold and Chel.
So what do you need me for?
Well, maybe I don't need you anymore.
Well, then, why don't you just go back
to Spain, and I'll stay here,
and we'll both get what we want!
-That's... fine with me, pal!
-Fine with me too!
-Ooh.
-Fine!
-Ouch.
-Okay!
-[Evil Chuckling]
-[Both] All right!
Tie him up!
-[Roaring]
-What?
-[Jaguar Roaring]
-Whoa.
-[Roaring Continues]
-[Both Gasp]

That was good, huh?
[Grunting]
[Cheering]
-[Cheering Continues]
-Hey, a little help, please?
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!
-I've decided to stay.
-Oh, this is wonderful news.
What a glorious day for El Dorado.
Lord Miguel has decided
to live among us!
Tulio!
-Is everything okay?
-[Cheering Continues]
Everything is... fine.
[Wind Howling]
There isn't much
I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all
there'll always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
-Beckoning the great divide
-[Grunts]
Ask no questions
Take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
All I know is all we had
Is over
Said and done
Friends never say good-bye
[Chorus]Friends
Never say good-bye
[Chattering]
Ha!
[Villagers Laughing]
Ahhh! Whew!
-Mmm.
-Friends never say good-bye
-[Children Giggling]
-[Man] Take care.
-[Child] We'll miss you!
-Thank you.
-Never say good-bye
-[Nickers]
[Groans]
-[Groans]
-[Chuckles]
-[Giggling]
-Friends never say
Good-bye
[Chorus]Friends
Never say good-bye
Well, good luck.
Yeah. You too.
Never
Say good-bye
[Nickering]
[Nickering Continues]
-[Villagers Gasping]
-Whoa.
-Whoa, boy, what is it?
-[Loud Nickering]
[Man Shouting]
-[Explosions]
-[Chattering]
-Cortes.
-My lord, what is it?
Chief Tanni!
Chief Tanni!
-Approaching the city...
is an army of strangers.
-[Weapons Firing]
We are safe here.
They'll never find the gate to the city.
But, sire, they are being led
by Tzekel-Kan.
He survived!
Warriors, prepare yourselves for battle!
[All Shouting]
Chief, you cannot fight them!
Then how can we stop them?
We can't.
-Hmm.
-[Firing Continues]
Uh, one moment, please.
-Okay, here's the gate. Here's the boat.
-Uh-huh. And?
-Here's the gate. Here's the boat.
-Okay.
-Got that. And? Tulio!
-Well, here's the "goat,"
and here's the "bate."
[Shouts]
-[Chittering]
-[Gasps] That's it.
We'll crash the boat
into the pillars.
That's it? I mean--
But-[Scoffs]
-What about the gold?
-Well-[Sobbing]
[Whiny Voice] Chief!.
[Clears Throat]
[Normal Voice] Chief.
I've got a plan.
[Villagers Shouting]
Hold the line steady!
They're almost in place!
[Whinnying]
It better be there, for your sake.
[Sighs]
Okay, Chief, on my signal!
Ready! Hit the pillars!
-Now!
-[Shouting Continues]
-[Rumbling]
-[Gasps]
[Weapons Firing]
-They're breaking too fast!
-Tulio, the sail!
[Grunting]
[Grunting Continues]
It's stuck!
[All Grunting]
-[Both Shout]
-[Gasps]
They're not gonna make it. Altivo!
[Nickering]
-[Whinnying]
-[Shouts]
-[Whinnies]
-Are you crazy?
[Yelling]
Get off the boat, Miguel,
or you'll never see the city again.
I know. You don't think I'm gonna
let you have all the fun, do you?
Come on.
We've got a wave to catch.
-[Yelling]
-[Whimpers]
-Get out of the way!
-Huh?
Hold on!
-Whoa!
-[Whinnies]
We're gonna have to hit it broadside!
That's your plan?
But the gold!
-I know!
-[Gasps]
Just turn the boat!
On impact, everybody jump!
[Gasping, Groaning]
[Coughing]
[Panting]
We made it.
It worked.
[Chuckling] It worked.
-Wait. Get down!
-Ouch. Ow.
-There they are.
-[Men Shouting]
[Gasps]
No.
You lying heathen.
There's nothing here at all.
No. Wait. Wait.
[Grunts, Gasps]
-Men, seize him!
-What?
There is no El Dorado here.
Onward, men.
[Groans]
-[Gasps]
-[Chittering]
Wait! No, wait!
Wait!
[Echoing]
-[Sputters]
-[All Laughing]
-Yes!
-Now, that was an adventure.
Yes. Yes, it was.
And, um,
-[Sobbing] it was so much gold!
-[Chuckling]
-I'm fine.
-Good.
-Let's go.
-[Sighs]
Partner.
Partner.
Hey, guys, come on!
You don't wanna stay here
forever, do you?
-But... we don't have a map.
-We don't have a plan.
Well, that's what makes it interesting.
You're right!
What are we waiting for?
Let's follow that trail!
-[Whinnying] Hyah!
-[Groaning]
-Oh, the sweet unfolding
-Come on, boys!
-Of an antique mystery
-Hey, Altivo!
-All will be revealed
-Sit, boy! Sit!
-Chel, we're not on the horse!
-[Chel Laughing]
On the trail we blaze
[Chittering]
[Snorting]
[Twittering] Uh-Uhh.
Eh! [Crunch]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me-e-e
Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again
Someday soon
I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me-e-e
Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again
Some day soon
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-[Vocalizing]
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me-e-e
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again
Someday soon
The more I learn
The more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart
The roving eye
Have come to rest
Do not apply
The frantic chase
The crazy ride
The thrill has gone
I step aside
And I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me
By just existing
Only this is true
-I love you
-[Chorus Vocalizing]
-I love you
-[Vocalizing Continues]
Without question
I love you
-The more I want
-[Chorus] The more I steal
-The more I steal
-The more I hold
The more I hold
The less is real
-All worldly things
-I follow blind
-I follow blind
-In hope, not faith
In hope, not faith
Was paid in kind
The line is drawn
The change is made
I come to you
I'm not afraid
And I'd believe
In anything
Were it not for you
Showing me
By just existing
Only this is true
I love you
