RE: NO SUBJECT
I WANT TO EAT YOUR PANCREAS.
Create a pitch-dark room and close your eyes
So you won't notice the pain in your heart
The one to open the curtain
blocking out the dazzling rays
Is none other than me and my shaking hands
Stop running away, pretending not to see
Even your unpleasant and cowardly sides
If you acknowledge and embrace them
There will be a new you
Passing through the night
And trekking through the darkness
I'll come meet you
Even the sea of wounds and the forest of sorrows
Won't get in my way
I'll take the poison
Passing through the night
And trekking through the darkness
I'll come meet you
I won't look away from the bright morning light
So I just keep blinking
I WANT TO EAT
YOUR PANCREAS

THE LITTLE PRINCE
I'M STUCK IN THE HOSPITAL
FOR TWO MORE WEEKS!
COME SEE ME TONIGHT!!
Rubbing both eyes,
then opening them
An afterimage of the residual night remains
Sinking into the pillow are pieces of memories
It was a dream of a summer night
My senses are faint and not all there
I'll hold your hand until I can feel your warmth
It's a secret,
this dream I had
How remembering it could make me so happy
It's a secret,
this dream I had
That it would come true in your warm arms
In this eternal dream
Rubbing both eyes,
then opening them
It's the same dream again today
I'M LEAVING THE HOSPITAL THIS MORNING!
LET'S GET LUNCH
I WISH I COULD BE LIKE YOU
I WANT TO EAT YOUR PANCREAS

LIVING WITH DYING
The forecast for the cherry blossoms was in vain
All of the blooms were scattered by a downpour
The breeze in April was still chilly
And the nights were still long
The stale firework shells
Waiting in the closet for their time
Bothered by the smoke but still happy
That's how I remember you
You started copying me
by keeping your nose in a book
You'd fallen asleep with your head
on my lap one fall day
Not too fond of the cold
So we shared our warmth
Even the freezing season
Wasn't so bad anymore
Thank you and goodbye
They're both here
I'm sorry and I want to see you
Still remain, too
I'm happy and I'm lonely
They're both left behind
I miss you and I'm in pain
I never even had the chance to tell you
When the wind blows again
And I'm reminiscing
Spring, summer, fall, and winter
Cycle again
The taste of food, the color of flowers
The natural, sweet smells
That the warmth of others weren't just numbers
You taught me with your touch
In my ears, so significantly
You've changed all my senses
It might be too late
But there are all these things
Thank you and goodbye
They're both here
I'm sorry and I want to see you
These feelings I've fostered
I'm happy and I'm lonely
I can now express them in words
I miss you and I'm in pain
I've embraced them
When the wind blows again
And if you ask me to hurry
I should go soon
It's my turn
For thousands and millions of times
I'll think back upon our time
For thousands and millions of times
For the next seasons
Spring comes, then summer
Then fall, then winter
And back again to spring
And then the spring after that
To meet you once again
In the spring I've been longing for
