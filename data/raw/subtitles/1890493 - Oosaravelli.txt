Uncle! Do you know Tony?
Tony? Don't ask me about him.
He's a mad man!
l'll not say anything about him.
Tony is vety good man,
but he's not useful for guys like you.
We must know about him.
He's mad about money,
he'll do anything for money.
Gave me Rs.10000 more.
Who told you he's mad about money?
Whether you give money
or not, it's okay to him,
he insists character is
more important.
Oh God! My money! Rs.1 crore!
More over dollars.
Why didn't you pay Rs.20000
you owe me?
Couldn't you've taken it from it?
l don't need my Rs.20000 from it,
you must pay me.
Oh no! Each one gives different
idea about him.
How does he really look like?
Who so ever he may be facing,
he'll be over powering him.
His blood too is B Negative like him.
His nerves are not nerves.
High tension wires!
lf evetyone's heart beats 72 times,
his heart beats 42 times only,
they call it as Napoleon heart.
He'll never get any heart trouble for
that but people who face him get it.
The most dangerous part
in his body is eyes,
he's an enigma!
To say it in short, he's an extraordinaty
man who looks ordinaty.
Did you get him?
ls he handsome?
You don't have any thoughts,
Tony is vety good man.
He'll never hurt even an ant.
No...no...please don't beat me.
lt seems you'll never hurt even an ant,
why are you beating me then?
You're not an ant, right?
l'll never hurt only ants!
What sort of a man he is?
Won't he listen to anyone?
He'll listen...
to his father.
Bloody useless son!
Got beaten up and fallen down?
You took money and committed
yourself, right? Get up l say!
You're ruining my honour,
you're unfit to be my son.
Go...beat him...beat him!
Beat him, bloody useless son!
Hey father! You're dead but killing me!
Hey you guys! Stop!
lf l don't beat you now, l think
a soul here will not rest in peace.
Wait, l'm coming!
ls he dead but keeps appearing?
He says so!
l was never so confused in my life,
what's this? Who is he?
The more you know about someone,
you get some clarity,
but the more you know about him,
the more you get confused.
There are 400 homes here and evety
home has a different idea about him.
He makes the rules and he breaks it.
Where is he now?
l must meet him right now.
Don't know sir, didn't see him here
for about a year,
l'm sure he would be in
new character somewhere,
evety man on earth has a character,
if there's any character without
any character, that's his character.
What did you say now?
Please don't ask again
and confuse me.
To say in short, to achieve his end,
he's ready to change
any number of colours,
his father gave him the name Tony,
the perfect name to him is...
Chameleon!
Start the vehicles!
lsn't he the right man for you?
He's right man
but we're not right for him.
We're small time thugs
doing small time business.
We'll find another man for Bhai.
Come on boys,
let's make a phone call to Bhai.
Hey Tony! Where are you now?
ln an attack on the terrorists
by lndian army in Kashmir,
Chief of lndian Mujahideen Yasser Mohammad
was arrested by lndian army.
Within 10 hours of this incident,
terrorists kidnapped tourists threatening
to kill them if they don't free Yasser.
Bring four men!
Kill them!
Hey Major! Take a decision quickly
and free our leader.
lf not l'll send one body
evety 10 minutes.
Who is that?
Who are you?
Oh a girl!
You...?
l'm a man!
Will they kill us too?
- Any doubt?
Thank God, l found a man to open
my heart before l die.
Where are you from?
- Hyderabad.
You're from...?
- Mumbai!
Where ever we may be from,
looks like we came to Kashmir to die.
l didn't come here to die,
l came here to see Kashmir.
lt's all my damn fate!
l came to Delhi for a fashion show,
l forced Chithra to come to Kashmir
though she warned me not to go.
She stayed back in hotel room,
l came out to enjoy the snow,
and got stuck here,
there's only snow in Kashmir,
nothing is good.
How long would they take to kill us?
Just a while ago he said 10 minutes,
it's reduced to 5 minutes now.
Are we going to die in 5 minutes?
How can we die in 5 minutes?
Aren't you tensed about it?
Don't you feel like escaping?
Why are you silent?
Why don't you say something?
What's your age?
- 25!
25?! Then you'd have seen
everything in life.
l haven't yet seen anything...
lndeed vety big age gap.
l've so many big dreams,
l wanted to become a fashion designer,
wanted to become personal
designer to Katrina,
wanted to have panipoori in Delhi,
wanted to buy a car to Chithra,
but l'm dying without fulfilling
any of this wish,
l'm talking alone,
please you too say something.
What?
Please say something
to boost my confidence,
You please move this side,
move your hand little.
Dreams?
l don't anything like that.
How can you without dreams?
You're tensed.
Can't you share feelings
at least before dying?
Right! What if we die suddenly!
l don't have any dreams
but l've a feeling.
A girl friend in my life,
a small romance,
first kiss, what if l die without
enjoying all this!
One should be fortunate for that!
Like a thunder the first kiss
smacked his lips...
Swiftly spreading like poison
all over his body...
Anyway l can't fulfill
my dreams this night.
At least your dream is fulfilled.
Think me as your girl friend till death.
The first kiss dug in the brain
like crow bars...
The first stood shining before
like a thousand Suns...
My dear, l'll not leave you even
on the face of death...
My dear, l'll never forget you
even in my next life...
My dear, l'll blink even
if earth breaks into two now...
The bridge of kiss built by you
in me will not even shake...
My body is thrilled,
it has turned into a canon...
Raking up passionate desires
in my eyes, O dear...
l want to live...
wish is growing in me...
l want to kill...
the death chasing us...
A war...destruction...
a violence is raking up in me...
A charm...an intoxication
is sweeping over me...
A life...a motion...
a fire is simmering in me...
A friendship...
a thirst is enamoring me...
Ripping away the darkness of the past...
burning me with raging fires...
My dear, your touch gives me
all the power and strength...
A rage...a futy...frenzy is
taking over me...
A peace...a song of happiness
is lulling my heart...
A Yoga...a sacrifice...
it's taking me without any stop...
A bond...a fortune...
is waiting for me...
Breaking the walls of fear...
hearing the voice of fights...
Your friendship is giving
positive signals, O my dear...
Rs.10 crores! 10 month plan!
Got you perfectly!
ls it hurting you?
lt is hurting me here
for quite long time.
Shouldn't anyone else other
than you do this business?
You rule the harbours, arms,
drugs and extortion in lndia
Will you kill if anyone dares
to enter the field?
Once you're dead, l'll kill your
brother Ajju Bhai also.
lt isn't as easy as you say.
What a great confidence!
Pick up the call,
tell him lrfan Khan is dying.
Yourjob will be done.
lf not l'll come personally
to finish it.
Yourjob is done. Pay the money.
l've paid already, bhai.
l said you didn't, yourjob is done,
pay immediately.
l've sent!
- No! l didn't get it, send now.
What's your confidence!
Can't you see you're dying?
You're cheating me.
- l'm cheating, l've sent it.
Cheating isn't in my blood!
l've been doing business with
you for many years.
l'll kill you!- Shut up!
Hereafter entire business is yours.
Do what so ever you can,
why should l pay you?
He's finished!
l got you!
The time given to him is over.
Let's go boys!
Who is this boy?
Are you the Shiva gang?
Can't you see it?
Come on boy!
No...no...go away!
He's changing the instrument!
- No please...enough!
You've bashed us black and blue!
Who you are?
Tell me, why are you beating us?
ln fear...
Why?
You all came to Madhura Nagar
yesterday, right?- Yes!
Has Shiva gang become
so cheap to you?
You're not giving money.
l'll wait in your godown,
come with Rs.50000 by noon.
Are you his man?
No, l'm in no way connected to him.
Then? Why this violence?
You threatened him while leaving, right?
lf you don't pay by noon, not only you,
l'll see that entire Madhura Nagar
is removed from Hyderabad map.
l came yesterday only
to live in Madhura Nagar.
l came to know he didn't pay you.
As warned by you l feared you may wipe
out Madhura Nagar along with me,
so l came here to
wipe you out before that.
l spent last night completely
in fear without food or sleep.
lt was just a warning,
it was just a bravado.
You carty on your business but please
don't scare common man like me.
Because l don't know
what would l do in fear.
Bye brother.
Brother!
What would you do in fear?
- l'll run away.
What about you?
- l'll catch my wife tightly.
But why is he scaring us
if he gets scared?
What's his character?
- lsn't it new, brother?
lt seems he beat you.
- Yes sir.
Get into the jeep.
- Why?
He has lodged a complaint on you.
- Why?
He beat you, right?
Fearing retaliation from you,
he has lodged a complaint.
lf he gets scared he'll beat
and he'll file a case on us.
Who the hell he is?
- lsn't it new, brother?
Do you've any sense?
When tailor told his difficulty,
you felt pity and gave him Rs.20000.
How am l to pay the rent
to the owner now?
Manage it somehow, please.
You've started taking
social service vety seriously,
better cool down,
recently you kissed
a young man facing death.
l felt like that then, so l did it.
- Take it.
lf he comes after you for that reason,
you'll understand then.
That's why l escaped from there
without informing him.
Never trust boys.
Even boys have the
same opinion on girls.- Satire?
l'm getting to flight, l've to rush.
Rent!
- Your dress is great.
You designed it.
- You've added sheen to it.
Make a tty, l'll not fall for it.
lnfact you owe me Rs.10000 after
deducting for this designer dress.
lt's ringing in my heart.
- No the door bell s ringing.
Then, l'll go.
Get lost!
- l'll go.
Who are you?
Who are you?
What? Didn't she tell you?
l and she in Kashmir...
l expected this.
Didn't she tell you?
She has gone to US.
Only 2 hours is there for flight.
- What?
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
You came back from Kashmir
yesterday only, going to US today.
You left without informing me.
You know how l got tensed?
l found you after great difficulty.
Are you going away to America?
You can't go.
l need to talk to you, come with me.
Please listen to me.
- l'll not, need to talk to you, come.
Stop.
- l'll not.
l'm not the going now.
- Then?
My would be.
Rakesh, l told you about a man
saving my life in Kashmir. That's him.
You saved my life too
not just her life.
Leave!
Not my hand but the girl.
What are you saying?
Have you gone mad?
Yes, l've gone mad on seeing her.
l see her everywhere whether
l close my eyes or open.
You're failing to understand,
we've got vety well.
Anyway you're going to US,
find yourself a white girl there.
That will be good for your range
and she'll be good for my range.
This is not handshake but
you're giving me a promise.
Leave his hand.
ls he a mad man?
l think he's little crazy.
Normally good.
l'll deal with him.
Sir, you're getting late to flight.
You're getting late, go.
l'll stay back.
Will you cancel your program
for this trivial issue?
l'll make sure the problem is solved
by the time you come back.
Go, Home Minister is waiting for you.
l'm leaving trusting you.
- Go. l'll manage him.
Do you've any sense?
l left Kashmir without informing
suspecting you'd do like this.
You're following to disturb me.
Do you know what did
you just told him?
What am l to do? You told me to consider
you as girl friend till death. So l am.
l told like that fearing
we would die in minutes.
Please tty to understand,
15 days from now l and Rakesh are going
to marty after he returns from US.
That's why l'm after you.
Though you were committed to Rakesh,
you thought about me and my last wish,
can l get a better girl than you?
You answer me, can l?
l'm telling this because
you saved my life,
we both came back from certain death,
this is our second chance in life,
each one of us have their own life.
l don't want to leave the second chance.
Anyway Rakesh isn't here,
can l tty my luck with you for 15 days?
Tty?
l promise, l'll not disturb you.
l'll just make a tty.
- What tty?
Please, l beg you.
l'll tty before Rakesh comes back.
How much ever you may tty,
l'll not fall for you.
lf l fail l promise l drop out.
Till then, please give me
an opportunity.
Okay, tty your luck.
What's your name?
Really?
- Really Niharika.
My Harika...

Say it few times, you'll get used to it.
Greetings brother!0

You reside in Madhura Nagar, right?
Why did you come to Mehdipatnam?
l stopped going there because
it's your area so l came here,
but you've come with a knife here,
you're here to kill me, right?
This is not a knife, just a dummy!
He's looking down!
He has come with a bag again!
What's this? How can we run
business in fear like this?
lf we've to get out of this fear,
we must stop him fearing us.
lf you take one glass,
evety fear in you will vanish.
l don't drink.
Okay, l'll drink. l'll lose my fear.
You said you don't drink.
- My father drinks.
Does your father smoke cigarettes?
- l smoke.
Who is your father?
Where is he?
Right next to me.
- Next?
Where is he?
Right here next to me.
- Here?
Where?
- No jokes please. No one is there.
Father, nobody believes you're here.
Lift the glass and keep it here.
That's it.
We came here to make you stop
fearing us but you're scaring us.
No...no...that is...
Tell me now.
What you fear most?
- You!
Apart from me.
l fear my love stoty may end in failure.
Love stoty?
Yes, mine is a different love stoty,
The girl l love already has a boy friend.
What's different in it?
The girls we love have husbands too.
You continue.

Can we carty on our business then?
You shut up, you carty on please.

Then the girl must be

Any lover would take a girl
from street to home,
but you want to get her

You carty on please.
She mustn't know l ordered you
and you did it.
You mustn't scare or threaten her.
lnfact she mustn't know anything.
But she must be thrown out
on streets in an hour.
How?
Greetings brother!
The portion below is fantastic like you.
Who the hell are you?
Nothing, if you throw out the tenants
from the portion now,
we'll occupy it in an hour,
it's that simple.
How dare you come to my home
and threaten me, go away!
Why did you kill him?
l just touched him, that's all.
Don't l know about your touch?
Someone is calling.
Where is Sathya?
l didn't even touch him.
Don't l know what would happen
even if you don't touch?
How did he die?
Will you kill our men for asking
you to throw out the tenants?
l don't want this life without them,
l'll also die!
Oh God! He jumped out!
Did he die too?
No, one man jumped but
there are two bodies.
Oh my God!
- Where are you going?
Two more bodies are coming.
l don't want any more,
you stay here only.
Madam, please switch on the TV,

Our owner threw us out suddenly.
What will you do now?
Call Rakesh.
- What if you call?
Come on do it,
l forgot he's not in lndia, right?
Luckily l saw a house
in the next street,
if it's okay, you can take it.
Rent is also not much.
- No.
Think over it.
Drunkards will take over the street.
Let's pay him extra Rs.100
for showing vacant house.
What about the luggage?
Smaller luggage please,
can't carty big ones.
l think power cut, come carefully.
Boys, keep the luggage there.
- Okay brother.

l'll pay Rs.2000,

You're getting late, go now.
Aren't you little overboard?
Come down please.
Whose house is this?
- Mine.
That's his plan!
He brought his lover to his home.
Where will you stay now?
Where will you stay then?
He's in our home and
we're getting wet in rain.
Time is on his side.
- This is too much!
l'll stab him to death!
He's over doing things!
l'll kill him!
Brother, l'm hearing sounds
from outside, l'm scared.
Why are you shouting like this?
Looks like vety big bungalow.
He brought you home in
darkness to thrill you,
it's all his plan!
My photo?
He has made to his liking!
- lsn't it vety good?
Good, l'm sure this is his house,
it's his plan.
Niharika Nilayam
He has built a home

Whatever it is, home is fantastic!
lt's his entire plan. Let's vacate.
Wait, let it be his house
or anyone else's,
let's pay rent and stay, if there's
any problem, let's vacate then.
Did you see he's making passes?
- Would l fall for it?
l love myself vety much...
l love you more than myself...
l'm there for you anywhere...
My love's other name is blue sky...
Hot sunrays too have to pass me
and your cheeks tan it...
Any uneasiness that may strike you
will be filtered by my eyes, dear...
Myself and air are competitors...
to reach you as your breathe...
Myself and earth adjust ourselves...
to carty your feet on ground...
All flowers belong to you...
all the thorns belong to me...
l'm your shadow that
engulfs hot sun...
The colour you like is
the colour l love...
l've changed my colour
for your smile...
Brother, go on.
Slowly...
Hey, silence please.
Wrong Tony! Never watch lover
like that before marriage.
Oh my God! Why is she here?
Who is she then?
l didn't see anything, you know?
What sorty?
Do you know what you've done?
No Niha, l thought you'd be there.
l didn't mean like that.
Chithra, l swear l didn't see anything.
lf you're still angty,
see me like that.
Will you please stop it?
For God sake, don't ever show
your face to me.
Return it!
Stop you bastard!
Will you stop it?
Take him to hospital immediately.
Do you understand
what you're doing?
Will you kill him?
- He deserves that punishment.
l'm more scared of your
behaviour than him.
How could you beat a man to bleed?
That's how l'll react if anybody
comments on my love.
Love? What love?
Do you take it as love if l talk
to you or enjoy yourjokes?
You saved my life, l didn't want to hurt
so l told you tty your luck.
That's why l tolerated
all your excesses. Enough of it.
l'm telling you now, listen carefully.
Whether it's 15 days or 15 months,
l'll not change my mind.
At least now leave me alone
and go away from my life.
l didn't do it wantonly.
l thought it was rod and pulled it,
came to know later it was your hand.
What a lousy life!
Do l need love?
l don't know what is love,
don't know how to behave with lover,
just because l've free time,
l made a tty,
no use of having a wish,
one must be lucky.
l think l'll lose my image too.
Love between us will not work out,
so l'm dropping out.- What?
Hereafter l'll not disturb you
in the name of love,
that's why l'm killing my love.
Really?
- Don't trust me, l swear on her.
Great relief! l can't bear anyone
getting hurt for me.
Thanks for dropping out of love
understanding me, Tony.
Shall we become friends
to celebrate the death of love?
l don't have any problem
to be you friend,
basically you're a good man.
Actually friendship is great.
Shake your hands with me.
But one condition,
l could take love failure,
but l can't bear if friendship fails,
you must be vety sincere, okay?
From now on we both are great friends!
- Not just we both but we three!
Friend? Why friend?
You said you can't live without her.
- l still say the same.
l can't live without my friend.
Can't you live without your friend?
Never seen any friendship like this.
Earlier you said lover, now you
say lover, you're confusing me.
Okay, let's come clear on it.
Take this as lover and
this as your friend.
Tell me who are you between that two?
lsn't it new?
You're happy now, right?
Then, let's celebrate.
How dare you want to celebrate
on my love failure!
Please don't tell him l'm ctying.
Why is changing so many
colours so quickly?
l think chameleon is better than him.
There are just two ways
to get him off our backs.
One is going far away from him.
- That's impossible.
l know that's why l've a second option.
Second is to make him a member
of our gang. - That's better.
Brother!
- Brother!
l told you we've a boss,
he wanted to meet you.
Will you come without fear?
- l'll come.
But it's not so easy to meet our boss.
We've some rules,
please don't mistake us.
- No, l'll not.
Put the mask!
Get in.
Get him down.
Brother, there are steps here,
get down carefully.
Sircar! l've brought him!
Not that side, this side.
- Where's that hand? Got it!
Remove the masks,
why are you both wearing it still?
You each other, right?
Why wear mask again? Remove it.
My boys told me everything
about you,
not yours, that's my seat.
l must tell you about myself too.
Evetyone here has a code name.
You know him, right? He's Shiva.
He's Sathya, that's Govinda,
that's another Govinda,
he's Adivee.,
he's latest entty Appalaraju,
she's Raat and she's Bhoot.
Are you their company?
Basically you're a gang of robbers.
Don't feel for bringing you in a mask,
nobody must know this place.
vety secret place.
- What's so secret?
From Secunderabad
came down to Seethaphalmandi,
we're in the ground floor of Lakshmi
Nivas building in Shivalayam street.
Did you tell him full address
and brought him here?
We didn't tell him Sircar,
we said he's vety clever,
how did you find it?
Flashback please!
This is Secunderabad.
- Yes.
Tell him to go to Seethaphalmandi.
Go to the left into Shivalayam street.
Where should we stop?
- Lakshmi Nivas.
We've reached the place,
tell him to stop.
lt's okay you got the address,
how you know we're in ground floor?
You took to the third floor in lift
and made me walk down,
l knew it was ground floor.
How did you know the lift
stopped in the third floor only?
One more flashback please.
This will not get you an entty
in my gang.
You've to do to something now,
tell my name now.
Your name is Jayapradha not JP.
You're not using it now.
How did you find he's not wearing it?
lntelligence not important,
common sense is enough for this,
would anyone make for his size?
Why are you passing comments
on my brother-in-law?
He's your brother-in-law,
he too is not using it.
Will you use whatever l use?
You'be know one thing,
he's using all your things.
Don't you've any sense?
Will you use all my things?
How can l run a gang with such fools?
l'll take you into my gang,
but tell how will you help
to develop this gang?
Okay boss.
Who is the biggest Don here?
He does everything from street
to Mumbai business.
l want him, call him on phone.
Why?
- Please call him, boss.
Who is it?
Why did you cut the call?
Gave him a missed call,
he'll call us back.
Vety low balance.
- Crap! Call him again.
l'll give him one ring.
- Please make the call.
Will you give one ring?
l'll pick it up.
He picked the call.
Give the phone to Jeevi.
- Somebody online for you, boss.
He Jeevi, your game is over.
JP will stop you in evety
business you do.
Who are you man?
l'm JP's man.
- Who is JP?
Jayapradha, he's the new don,
to settle the matter we need to meet.
When should we meet?
When it rains.
- When will it rain?
lt'll rain when ever we meet.
Cut the line.
You're finished with this phone call.
- Finished?
You'll become a great don!
Stop overacting and change
your get up and set up.
What's it?
How's friendship? ls it good?
You've become vety proud.
- Where's your other friend?
Sleeping.
- Sleeping?
Do you've any sense?
The job is yours, the program is yours,
told me to pick you up at 7.
l came here to pick up a friend,
are you still in bed?
Get up quickly, let's go out.
He wasn't like this as lover.
Where's Niha?
She's sleeping, want me
to wake her up?
No...no...it's just 10 am,
l'll wait for her.
l'll wake her up.
- l'll kill you.
Fill up the tank.
So, you go to old age home
evety Sunday.
Though the jeep is mine,
we're out on herjob,
ask her to pay.
l didn't bring my purse.
Don't worty, you've gold jewels
on you, right? Give the chain.
He's a crook.
Sir has already paid, madam.
Why are you behaving indifferently?
You're hurting me, you know that?
What did l do?
How was your behaviour till yesterday
and how it is now?
Oh that one!
That was love and this is friendship.
What's the difference?
Quite a lot of difference.
Love means caring,
friend means sharing.
How is my framing?
Love means caring,
friend means sharing...
Tell me O girl,
how is my framing?
What's your feeling?
Tell me my darling...
l'll turn my steering
which ever way you say...
Lovers mean you've meet
secretly like thieves...
Friends have a chance to meet
openly like lords...
Love means red rose which
is symbolic of anger...
White rose of friendship is cool...
At times he says love is better...
at another time says friend is great...
Which fine morning what he would
say he himself doesn't know...
At times he says dear...
at another time he says fear...
There's no update in which mood
he would be any given day..
lf your eyes shed tears,
l'll give my kerchief...
l'll wait till you return
after washing it clean...
lf your legs pain, l'll carty you...
After dropping you,
l'll make you massage my legs...
l'll get you a cell phone
if you ask for a sim card...
Even if you've switched it off,
l'll make it ring...
lf you give address,
l'll drop you at home...
l'll swipe your credit card
for the petrol...
Just l love you is enough
if you want to express love...
Language falls short to
explain friendship...
Though it's your mistake,
l'll say sorty...
l'll show you there's no ego
in friendship...
Past or present, present or future...
l'll always be there for you...
Rain or shine or streets of tears...
One who stays with you
through thick and thin is friend...
Where did you find him?
- ln Andheri, sir.
Did he say anything?
o matter how much we tortured,
he didn't say a word.
Confiscated a cache of weapons.
How much ever you may torture me,
l'll not say anything.
How long are you in Ajju bhai's gang?
8 months sir.
You're handling arms and weapons
it quickly means you moved up vety fast.
l'm just a courier, l just follow
instructions, l don't know anything.
Ajju bhai...his brother lrfan,
what's their next target?
What's their plan?
They're planning something big, sir.
To keep off praying eyes, they're
recruiting new men to do the task.
l don't know anything
more than this, sir.
Something is going to happen,
as per my list...
As per your list, we're following
four of Ajju's men,
we've complete details of evety one
with criminal background,
we've traced out all of them,
but one member is missing.
There are 4 cases on him, sir.
He'll do anything for money, but he's
missing for a year from Mumbai.
his name is Tony.
l want him.
Where is he? Trace him out.
Tell me!
- What should l tell him now?
say something.
lt's raining,
didn't you bring umbrellas?
Take out the umbrellas.
Did you call us to tell this?
Tell me what's the matter?
- What matter?
Stop all your business and
leave this city in 24 hours.
As you say.
- Not you, tell him.
Stop all your business and
leave this city in 24 hours.
What if l don't?
He's asking what if he doesn't!
- What did you say?
l'll bump you off!
- l'll bump you off!
This looks strange, where's the trigger?
ls there any protrusion in the middle?
Yes, there is.
- Press it.
What will happen if l press it?
- How do l know?
That's all?
Bloody! He died!
Why are they kissing my hand?
You've become a big Don, boss.
Who is she talking to?
- With Rakesh.
Why are you getting tensed?
-You're a friend, right?
Friend can become lover but
a lover can't become a friend.
Have you become one?
- No.
What?
- l've not.
What did you say now?
- l said l haven't become one.
lt means l've not become one.
Rakesh is coming tomorrow.
- Why are you saying it so dull?
Already 15 days have passed.
Didn't know the time.
l wanted to ask you for long time, how did
love start between you and Rakesh?
lt's a big tale.
- Oh! Say it as short stoty.
Do you remember the old age
home we visited recently?
We used to live in a flat
opposite to it 6 months ago.
lt was my habit to spend evety day
some time with them.
Once a situation took
them the streets.
ln the dispute the land went
to the opposite side.
They warned them to vacate
the place in few hours.
l went there to talk to
the opposite man.
He was Minister's son Rakesh.
As soon as l told him Rakesh returned
the land to the old age home.
Two days later he came with his
family seeking my hand in marriage.
l liked his approach.
l said okay.
That's how our love stoty started.
What?
l expected your love stoty to
be as great as Titanic film.
Just business!
lf you both start a business,
you can overrun anyone.
What did you say?
What else then?
Basically he wants you,
you want the land,
so he offered what you want,
and after two days gap,
he sought what he wanted,
you're too smart, fearing he may take
back the land if you refuse marriage,
you decided anyway l'll marty,
why not him and said okay to him.
Moreover painting this
business deal as love!
How can you say it's not love?
Not just once,
l'll say hundred times.
Because Rakesh is in your brain
not in your heart.
How can you decide Rakesh
is not in my heart? - Ask your heart!
When you were on the verge of death,
you remembered Chithra,
fashion designing,
and the panipoori you
eat in Delhi too!
But you were to marty him in 15 days,
you didn't remember him!
The value you've for panipoori
you don't have it for Rakesh.
Oh no! l got it just now!
Didn't l give up my love for
a useless man, right?
You too are saying right
in the flow.
l'll go out to have panipoori.
When you were on the verge of death,
But you were to marty him in 15 days,
you didn't remember him!
What are you doing here?
What's this? l'm her friend,
we've become friends.
l'm here to receive you.
- Friends?
Yes Raks! Didn't you tell him, Niha?
l've dropped from love,
she's high range and l'm low range.
lf she's top floor, l'm ground floor.
l'm not the right man for her.
And you're totally unfit for her,
you know that?
lf l'm ground floor,
you're C+, isn't it?
So listen to me and
you too become her friend.
Who are you?
- Friend!
When said love, l thought you
wooed her but you laid a bait.
As a friend l'm telling you,
you're not the right man for her.
Why are you silent?
Do you believe if he says friend?
He's playing games.
When l left he said lover
now says he's friend.
He's ttying to break us.
Why don't you believe me
if l tell truth?
We both are unfit for her,
so find another girl.
You stop!
You don't either of us to
marty her, right?- Right!
Good show as a friend.
Okay, neither you nor me
is right man for her,
will you marty her off to
any perfect man if find?
Answer me.
His game is going reverse,
he's shocked.
l'm ready to let her marty
another man.
Answer me.
l'm sad for not getting this idea
though l'm her friend.
l'm also ready,
you're also ready, right?
You're much better than me, right?
Stand by your word.
l'll work and you pay the bills,
l'll search and you'll spend,
don't ask me how l'll do it,
l'm throwing open challenge to find
a perfect man for her in 30 days,
and get her married to him.
Be ware!
lt's all over!
Your life is settled.
l'll be on the job.
What happened?
ls he dead?
He's dead now.
l told you to keep an eye
on her and that man,
so much has happened
and you've no information.
Who is he, father?
Though he's playing so many games,
she's watching it silently.
l can't act before her anymore,
l'm dying!
l feel l'm losing her.
After all for a girl...
No, for the girl only! l want her.
This is vety small issue,
if you lose balance for this,
how can you deal state
politics in future?
Manage mafia.
Evety man would do anything
to achieve something.
Find what he wants
and give it to him,
if it's not possible, kill him,
but please be little patient,
lrfan is coming down from Dubai,
it's good for us to be cool
till the job is done.
Moreover it's Ajju bhai's order.
Find out what he really wants!
Find a groom!
You said lover and then friend.
- You made lover into a friend.
Now you want to find
a groom for your lover.
What's this new stoty?
- lsn't it different?
Tell us the specifications
of the prospective groom.
Horse...he must be like a race horse!
Where can we find such a man?
- Search, you'll find.- Can we find?
Not you, must shoot myself.
- Found him!
Where?
Look there!
lsn't he exactly like
what l told you, right?
Just the same!
Find out if he's married or not.
- Okay.
He's fixed!
He's still there!
You're torturing us terribly!
l'll kill you!
How dare you fall across me!
With just one phone call
you changed my life completely.
Mafia has contacted me, they have
called me to Vizag for a big deal.
l'm going to meet Chota bhai,
it's all your grace, boy.
Evetybody is using me except you,
please use me.
Why should l use you?
All others are using, right? Enjoy it.
Just a minute, l got a phone call.
For killing local don l got this position,
what if l kill Chota bhai?
l've found a brilliant boy!
We must meet immediately.
What's the matter?
What do you really want?
Tell me what do you want to leave Niha?
Will you give anything?
- l will.
Will you give anything?
- Just make your wish, l'll fulfill it.
l want your life.
You said Niha is your life, right?
l want that life.
You said you were her friend.
l'll tell anything for love,
how could you believe it?
You've played too many games,
enough of it.
Leave Niha.
lt's vety hard to get a girl
for rogues like me,
l got her by chance,
with the same respect l'm telling
you to leave her, go away!
Are you threatening me?
Girls are not new to me.
She hit me softly somewhere,
l spent Rs.50 crores to
make her fall for me.
you don't know about me,
if you become hurdle, l'll kill you.
Go to Mumbai and ask
about Tony in any street,
they'll tell about cutting legs
for Rs.1000.
For the girl l like l don't know what
would l do or what would l cut?
Do you know who you're
crossing swords with?
l do business with mafia.
l do business with lrfan bhai
who terrorises Mumbai.
One phone call to bhai
is enough to kill you.
When caught with traffic policeman
for not wearing helmet,
we too cite such high
connections to scare him.
We're talking about girl and
you say about mafia.
lt's lrfan bhai...
can't you understand?
lf l don't get Niha, l'll kill her.
Oh both are caught red handed.
You saved my life again.
Both are caught,
why did she thank only you?
As soon as you called me,
l called her.
To show how crooked you're,
l said l'll tell few lies.
All that you said about yourself...
l told her its lie
what is true in reality.
What l told you is true in reality..
l'm a worse crook than you.
Why are you so happy?
- No l'm dull.
Even your smiling face
is like ctying face.
Stop joking! She's vety upset
about Rakesh matter.
People cty for love failure, but l'm seeing
someone ctying for saving life.
l feel ashamed to call you
as my friend, go away.
l too have the same feeling.
What did l do?
That's what l'm asking you,
what did you do?
How happy we should be now,
you must throw party in pub, enjoy a dance.
Do you've any such idea?
Why are you smiling boy?
Like a wax doll in a pair
ofjeans in festival...
Fair and bright like washed moon...
Delicious and hot like pickle...
You're devastating and rocking...
Let's do dandiya...
entire lndia will shake...
Your words are like blowing bombs...
Your eyes are fiety like petromax bulbs...
Your touch is electrifying
like a transformer...
You're ravaging like
a suave thief...
Telugu master wrote epic poem
on seeing me in Rajahmundty...
lf you come like a swan, even a tenth
class boy would become a poet...
When l walk on beach in Vizag,
l'll get 1000 love letters...
Why not? Getting lakh of letters is also
not wrong for such a great girl...
Am l really so beautiful?
l want to believe when you praise me...
There won't be darkness if you laugh
at night in your road when power fails..
Stop those white lies, boy,
you can charm with your words...
Even lilies and jasmine are
jealous of your tender body...
You enchant with your silly words...
You're divine beautiful moonbeam,
how can l not praise you?
Yourjob will be done.
l want to talk to you, Tony.
- Tell me, Niha.
l don't remember a moment when l was
happier than after meeting you.
But l'm happy evety moment
after meeting you.
lf l want this happiness
to be mine all the life,
You want to know
why l shot him down?
He cheated me in business.
Your material has left from Vizag.
Do you want Niha?
Don't l've so much capacity?
Don't l know who lrfan bhai is?
Answer me.
You hit me from behind and
asking me to believe your silly lies
Still l'm saying, to hell with lrfan!
Where are you?
One man is torturing me, bhai.
ls it? Then kill him.
l want to kill after making
him realise my power.
Then bring him here,
let's show him our power.
He's the man who said
to hell with lrfan!
Show me.
Look there! Look at lrfan bhai.
Greeting lrfan bhai!
Didn't recognise me? Ajju...Ajju bhai!
Will you become lrfan
on wearing suit and shoes?
From which drama company
did you bring him?
lf he's lrfan, then l'm Laden!
Bin laden!
l'll blow up your tower.
The same critical retort!
Should l believe if you beat me?
Who is he?
What makes you so confident?
You're alone and we're so many here.
Hardly there's a kilo of flesh
in your body,
you're so thin,
what's your confidence?
Electric wires too are thin like me,
but if you dare touch it,
it gives the shock of your life.
His death mustn't be easy,
he should shudder even to
think about her in ten lives,
he must think about lrfan only!
He's delivering dialogues too well,
you stop that nonsense.
Were you lrfan,
you'd have killed me long back.
Do you know what have you done?
l've killed Ajju bhai's brother lrfan
who was terrorising you.
Did you kill lrfan bhai
for a girl and her love?
Love, my foot!
How could you think
l would fall in love?
l had entered Hyderabad to kill
you guys not for the girl.
l didn't trouble your son
for love but to kill you all.
l wanted to kill lrfan in Kashmir,
but l waited to kill you
all together in one go.
l got you all!
l've been waiting for 2 months
to find a spot like this to kill you.
What a place you've selected!
l'll not leave anyone.
Minister Bharani, his son are missing for 24
hours and no information or clues about them.
Meanwhile 2 lorty loads of weapons
proceeding from Vizag were confiscated.
The accused escaped.
Home Minister has called an emergency
meeting of higher authorities.
Media are troubling us a lot, sir.
Think about how to face them, sir.
Don't worty about them,
worty about how to face Ajju bhai.
lf Minister's son is not found,
we'll lose our positions,
if Ajju bhai's brother is not found,
we'll lose our lives.
l'm tensed from all sides.
What's the tension sir?
Nothing, Central govt. has
sent a special officer.
Minister Bharani, his son and few other
missing people were found dead.
Along with them lrfan was also found dead,
he's mafia don Ajju bhai's brother.
Nobody knows who did this and why...
Niha, do you know about Rakesh?
Where is Tony?
l want to talk to him.
Special officer Krishna is investigating.
lt's we who left the lorty last night.
Police...stop!
Escape!
What if police come to know
we've links with lrfan.
Why would anyone kill lrfan bhai?
l'm getting tensed.
Shall l do massage?
- l'll kill you.
My boss is mad, you massage me.
Brother-in-law!
He's coming again.
What happened? Tell me.
Got a good stick?
He came here to kill them.
The man who killed them is
none other than Tony.
He promised to make you a big don,
and he gave him a long rope.
He shoved a stick from under
and escaped.
We're tensed and
you're making crazy gestures.
Gestures?
Can't you hear anything l say?
Tony did this.
We're tensed somebody has killed all
of them and you're making silly gestures.
Gestures?
lsn't my voice coming out?
Has my voice gone?
Or can't they hear it?
ls there any link between
lrfan bhai and Minister?
Who killed Minister and his son?
lnformation about this...
- We'll give details in near future.
Do you suspect Minister has
links with mafia?
Does bhai know this?
- Not yet.
He's on some island with his family.
What are you saying? lt's already
late, phone him immediately.
Who will call?
Who has the courage to tell him?
Ajju bhai who is making police
of 13 countries sweat it out,
he wants us to inform him somebody
killed his brother and stole Rs.500 crores.
l don't have that courage,
do you've it? Will you tell him? Tell me.
Tell.
You eat bhai, l'll tell you later
Bhai, lrfan bhai is dead.
- When?
Last evening.
- Where?
ln Hyderabad.
- How?
He was stabbed in chest.
- Who?
Don't know bhai.
Who did it?
- Don't know.
This is Rs.500 crore deal, bhai.
Where do you want the
money to be delivered?
lt seems lrfan is dead.
Who killed him?
- Don't know.
The word l hate to say,
you've made me say it.
The pain of not knowing father is
same for not knowing who killed you.
l should know the man who killed
my brother and is still living!
Why are you cutting the calls?
You heard me on my last
phone call, right?- l did.
You wanted this, right?
Why are then avoiding me?
To have it confirmed again for better.
What do you want to confirm again?
You said you loved Rakesh for
helping the old age home,
now you say you love me for
helping you in Rakesh matter,
l had a doubt if l'm in
your mind only.
l thought l'll get a clear picture
if l meet after few months. You got me.
How do l look to you?
What do you think of me?
Even on the verge of death you didn't
remember about Rakesh,
you asked me if it's true love?
But l feel like dying if l don't
see you for two days.
What do you call it?
Are both the same?
You're right here!
Answer me,
why don't you say something?
l know you're doing it wantonly,
please don't ever play with me like this.
l can't live even a moment
away from you.
Promise never to leave me.
l'll not leave.
Niharika, you're my path...
Niharika, you're me...
Niharika, you're my wish...
Niharika, l've become you...
My life wants only you...
My heart wishes for you only...
lf you ask me how much
l love you, l can't tell...
l'll say l love you, that's all...
What am l wish you to do with me?
l just want you to be with
me always, that's all...
My eyes never close
when you're near me...
My lips will never open
when you're away from me...
My hands will never rest
if you're with me...
l can't take a step further
if l don't get you...
When we've become one and are
together, no use of saying two...
Once you come to me,
l'll not leave you, hold my hand...
How many mistakes you may commit,
they all appear to be good...
How much ever you may cross limit,
it's giving me pleasure...
Whatever you may scold
is music to my ears...
How much ever you may be stubborn,
it's delightful to me...
We're speaking as if this is
the last moments of our lives...
Though we're discussing so much,
it's strange we get more to talk...
What's our condition now?
Don't know who killed them but the
police officer is pain in our ass.
Brother-in-law!
Boss, you don't hear me,
so l've written everything, read it.
l'm tensed and going mad about
incidents happening here,
are you making fun of me
saying l'm an illiterate?
Where did you go away?
l'll get some relief if you're with me.
He's torturing me.
- What's this torture?
He's gone mad.
Yesterday he was gestures and
now he's scribbling on paper.
He has written something on paper.
You please read it.
You shut up!
He has written chiding me.
Not yet told him? l thought you
would've told him by now.- What?
Nothing, he has written in detail who
killed Minister, Rakesh and lrfan.
Who?
- Me!
You?
- Yes boss.
No jokes please,
l may get an heart attack.
Would l joke about such matters?
Wait a second.
l killed them and hid the
stolen money here.
Did you kill them? Why?
lf l kill them, l thought you'd
occupy their position.
When did l ask you to kill them?
Did l kill Jeevi on your order?
Didn't l kill Jeevi?
Do you feel like that?
Press the trigger, let's see.
Why? Why?
l want to see you as the Don!
Happiness in you is my aim.
Agreed you killed lrfan for Sircar.
Why did you kill the Minister?
Feeling what would Minister do after
lrfan's death and so killed him too.
We know you beat up people
if you get scared,
will you kill if you feel pity?
What's this?
How can you kill at your will and wish?
You say you killed him for my sake,
l'm wetting my pants on seeing police.
l'm scared about getting caught.
Kill when you're scared, just say yes,
l'll kill the police officer too.
You never said yes,
anyway don't l know about you?
l'll kill him when the time comes.
What a smart man you are!
Looks like your voice is cracking
up with little shock.
What an intelligent man you are!
Better to stay away from you.
Before l could tell them you told them
everything and shut their mouths.
Nobody can catch you, somebody
from sky must come for you.
As far as l know we don't
have any enemies.
l don't suspect anyone.
They've unjustly killed
my son and grandson.
These are Minister's things.
20 days have passed since
lrfan bhai is dead.
Still no clue about who did it.
l'm dying with tension evety time phone
rings fearing it's from Ajju bhai.
Bloody fools! Tony did this for my sake.
l'm also dying with the same tension.
lntelligence reports suspect gang war.
lf Ajju bhai himself doesn't know it,
what can we do?
Tell him to come here
to find the killer.
Do you know who is it?
Don't know bhai.
Hearing the same answer for 20 days.
The feeling l don't know his killer is
hurting me more than lrfan's death.
l don't want to hear that word again.
Tell me now, do you know or not?
You know or not?
What's this option?
He'll kill if we say no,
if l say yes, l'll get caught
and he'll kill me.
This silence is scarier.
Bhai, give us little time...
- Enough, l'm here because you failed.
This is not gang war but
the work of a lone man.
l'll catch him is 24 hours,
till then no one must get treatment,
you must feel the pain.
lf you've any information,
please call me.- Okay.
My grandson was to marty
but he died.
Despite my warnings, he went
after that sinister lady.
That unlucky girl stepped into
this house bringing disaster.
What is Rakesh's love stoty?
After fixing marriage with Rakesh,
the girl fell in love with another man.
Who is he?
- His name is Tony.
Tony?
He's Tony.
He's Tony sir, he's missing for
a year from Mumbai.
ls this Tony's house?
- Yes sir. They've gone to the temple.
Which temple?
Vety far, outside the city Venkanna Gutta.
l want complete details about a man Tony.
God! Ajju bhai says he'll kill
him in 24 hours.
Tony is doing all this for me.
lf he finds Tony, l'm also caught.
To stay away from police and Ajju bhai,
we're leaving this place,
and came to offer prayers
to this remote temple.
Please shower your blessings.
Circumambulate the hill 4 times,
everything will be fine.
He is...
- We're going marty soon.
Please show me.
- No need, l know my future vety well.
Show your hand.
There won't be any lines,
only plans and moves.
You don't appear but little crazy.
- You said it perfectly sir.
You go around the sacrificial fire
and pour ghee into it.
lt'll do good for you and him.
- Okay.
Bye sir.
- Where are you going away?
l sent them away to talk to you.
l've never seen any man with
such a horoscope.
You think something, see something,
do something different,
you're an enigma to evetyone.
That's your affection sir.
Look, l've been seeing her for long time.
Vety good girl.
She loves you and
l can see it in her eyes.
Don't ever harm her.
You're born to play with dangers.
Don't think you.ll win always.
Danger is following you.
Why did the priest ask us
to go around the hill?
Thank God, he didn't ask to take
a round of the place.
Looks like he's here for us.
Sir...alms please....charity please...
He didn't recognise me.
Chithra! Stop!
Will you kill me? Kill me!
l never thought you were a good man.
Before evetyone knows about you,
kill Niharika too.
Poor crazy girl.
You're a criminal,
why did you enter her life?
Stop it!
Who entered whose life?
She entered my life.
Nobody knows Niharika
the girl l know.
lnfact Niharika herself doesn't
know who she is!
Yes, l'm a criminal.
Do you know what my world was?
My father!
My father is everything to me.
My father's job is to take money
from a crook and beat another.
He raised me to follow him.
Once he accepts, he'll never
back off even on facing death.
He was my inspiration.
One day my father...
Father....father...what happened?
What happened father?
They stabbed me.
Stabbed? Who did this to you father?
Old account...closed the account.
- Father...
No, that's his account.
Father, don't look up and talk
and look down and talk to me.
l'm scared of seeing my blood.
ls it deep cut? See.
Two stab wounds, little deeper,
no problem father.
No problem? l'm wounded and
you're talking, take me to hospital.
l feel like telling you something.
Father...what's it?
There's a crook in evety home,
but we've two in our home,
there should be only one
and that must be me.
this must stop with me,
my entire life went past before my
eyes while coming to the hospital
not a single thing or incident to
feel proud or to remember,
everything l ever did stopped
on this side of the pocket,
it never touched the heart
behind the pocket,
l'm sad for dying without
any satisfaction.
Father, nothing will happen to you.
l'm not sad for raising you like me.
But don't die a zero like me.
Evety one is born as zero,
life gives them a chance
to become a hero,
most fail to use it,
l too failed to use it,
life will give you also a chance
to become a hero,
don't leave the chance,
you'll know the day it comes,
hold it tightly,
when you look back in your life,
you must have satisfaction
of doing something good,
if you come up there without
doing, l'll kill you, Tony.
Father...why are you talking
like a dying man?
Where will l go leaving you, son?
l'll come back alive or
die and come back again.
l'll never leave your hand.
My father's dying words took
deep roots in my mind.
meanwhile another stoty was
happening elsewhere,
the stoty of Niharika,
whom l didn't knew then.
Just send your sister, that's enough
we don't want any property.
There's nothing to refuse him
but l'll not marty.
You'll not get another proposal like this.
Please listen to me.
-No brother.
Please explain her as a friend.
The boy is handsome and
he's perfect match to you. Agree!
What's your problem?
This is my problem.
l don't want to marty now, brother.
l don't want to go to US
and miss you all.- No dear...
Promise on me,
you'll not say one more word.
Why a gun in our home, brother?
Why do you need guns and
money for your marketing job?
As far as l know my brother
will never do anything wrong.
l'm not asking you, just showing
how much l trust you.
My brother never commits mistakes.
Am l a police officer
or a criminal?
Why that doubt, Sutya?
l don't know how to tell you.
Only you know l'm an undercover cop.
l'm doing for the nation which
l can't even reveal to my family.
Lived among the criminals and
tolerated their criminal acts.
But couldn't kill anyone.
Because situation is like that.
As a police officer
l want to kill them.
Don't rush.
lf l announce you're a
police officer suddenly,
do you know how dangerous it is?
l'll die for the countty but
not as a traitor.
l want to die in my uniform...
When l'm gone my family
must be proud of me,
they shouldn't feel sad
because l'm a criminal.
lf operation is not complete
all your efforts would go waste.
lt'll not go waste sir,
complete activities of Ajju bhai,
political links, terrorists plans,
financial hubs,
all the details are in it.
Today a crucial meeting
is planned in Mumbai.
Give me just one chance,
l'll finish the criminals.
This is enough,
give me 24 hours time.
l'll announce publicly that you're a cop.
Tell your family.
Dear, your brother here.
Come home immediately and
bring kids from school.
Okay brother.
Evety detail about you is in that file.
Your links with people, your accounts,
everything is there.
You don't have a place
in this world to hide.
Would years of my political life end?
Do something Ajju bhai, if not l and
my son will spend life in jail.
Rs.50 crores to close this case,
l'll give you another Rs.100 crores,
if you give me the
identity of your informer.
Leave it bhai, our people infiltering your
group and you buying them off,
this is routine for us.
But this is not routine for me.
The man who eat, stayed with me
and then back stabbed me,
l want know who he is!
l should know who he is!
You'll know in two days,
l'll announce him as a cop.
He mustn't die as a cop, he must die
in the mask he wore to cheat me.
He must die like a criminal.
He must remain as a traitor.
Today l'm going to tell you a truth.
Sutya is a gangster,
we've evidence that he has links
with arms and drug mafia.
lt has proved that he has
links with terrorists too.
We've information that he has links
with anti-social elements too.
5 months later...
lt took 5 months to come
out of coma.
Nobody survived.
People think your family
is a terrorist.s family.
Your brother is a gangster.
l too don't know what had happened.
Finding you alive l got you treated secretly
fearing they may kill you also.
You're dead according to them.
l've destroyed all your identities.
To this world you're no more.
lt's a miracle that you're alive.
But your health condition...
What happened?
l'm not able to say as a doctor.
But l can tell as a friend.
How much time do l've?
- Don't know.
Anything can happen at any time.
To tell the fact, there's no time at all.
Why did you save my life?
l feel dying when l think what had
happened before my eyes.
Why did you save my life?
They say nothing happens
without reason,
if l'm still alive,
there must be a reason,
l want to do something,
but l don't know what to do.
l'm a woman,
l don't know where to go.
Do me a favour,
show me the way yourself.
You pushed my life into darkness,
show me the light yourself.
Show me the light!
Show me the light!
Tony, they know our plan,
entire neighbourhood is coming.
Come, let's escape!
There are hundreds!
Let get them later.
He's alone, right?
Are you blind? ls he alone?
There are so many people here.
You may be seeing hundreds, but l can
see only one whom l want to beat.
Once the war starts,
you've to see only the target.
Lord Anjaneya...the mighty warrior...
Always be on my side...
There's no one to challenge you...
go ahead in achieving your aim...
You're the ultimate in truth and
stand by the good in their test...
Come with all power to
destroy the evil...
Come with all the force to
vanquish the wicked...
Lord Anjaneya, punish the evil
and protect the good...
Lord Anjaneya, you must blow the
conch of sacred monosyllable...
Even the fiercest missile
is nothing to you...
Even death dare not come to you...
You live in the hearts of your devotees...
Make it the highway in
this journey of the life...
l've ajob for you.
lt'll cost you.
Rs.1 crore!
One crore?!
Who? When? Where l've
to beat them? Tell me.
l'll beat anyone in this world.
Kill, don't beat them.
You left your bag.
Hey, stop!
Please stop, only you can do this job.
ls it any inauguration of shop that
only l must do it,
it's a murder. Go away.
Stop. Please listen to me,
keep the money.
lf you want l'll give my flat also
in Hyderabad.
Are you mad?
Go away.
Please stop...don't go away.
- l told you to go, leave me.
Tty to understand me, l beg you.
l don't have any other way.
- Leave me.
lf you don't accept l'll kill myself.
Leave me.
- l'll not.
Listen to me.
- l said leave me.
l'll leave only if you accept.
Tty to understand me,
only you can do it.
l've no choice.
Stop! Please don't go away.
l've given everything l had.
lf you want use me too!
When you look back at your life,
you must feel satisfied of
doing something good.
l'll do whatever you ask me to do.
They didn't even spared kids.
My brother is a good man.
l don't know who did it
and why they did it?
But l want to find them and kill them.
l'm scared of dying without doing this.
There's a bullet in my head.
l'll die if it is removed.
lf not l may forget the past any
moment so say the doctors.
That's why l'm rushing.
God showed me you at the right time.
Even if you agree, l don't know
when l'll forget all this.
Forget it!
Your revenge is mine
from this moment.
Don't spare anyone,
kill evetyone of them.
Promise to wipe out evetyone of
them who killed my family.
Promise me.
Though you may forget this promise
but l'll never forget it.
Not one of them would be alive.
When l heard the injustice done to her,
l remembered my father's words.
l decided this is the chance
life is giving me.
When l promised her,
l didn't even knew her name.
After promising her,
l didn't feel like knowing her name.
With clues given by her
l found one man,
but by then she forgot her past,
she went far away from me.
l too didn't search for her.
l didn't commit myself to
search someone.
lt was for hunt!
From Ajju bhai's man l got all the
details about the incident.
Few days later l went
to Kashmir for lrfan,
l met her there suddenly.
She left me with revenge earlier but
now she introduced me to love.
l came to know she has forgotten
me and is your friend now,
l understood she was happy
forgetting her past,
l followed her to Hyderabad.
l came to know she was in love
with a man who was a collaborator.
So, l killed her love first.
And later him.
When i met her,
she was not in a
condition to tell anything about her.
Understanding her condition,
l said l'm your friend.
l named her as Niharika.
l expected a small stoty behind her.
l didn't expect such
a dangerous past.
Why don't you tell her the truth?
lf l wanted to tell,
l would've told long back.
l agreed to do herjob without
knowing who she was,
but today l love her,
l can't tell her the past,
l saw her going through hell
after losing her family.
l don't want to tell the past and
make her lose the happiness,
and push her into the hell
where she was.
For evetyone forgetting
past is a bane,
but for Niha, it's a boon.
Anyway l'm there for her
to remember the past,
she must never know her past.
You should also not tell her.
l will not.
Though she took promise
and forgotten it,
you're still keeping her promise,
and doing it for her,
l don't think Niha would get
any better man than you.
You both must always
be happy together.
O flower, you're cutting me down
like a colourful axe...
You've played the Congo drums
in my heart...
Mango in your sari...
l'll pluck and eat it, dear...
You're like a lion...
is your other name honeybee...
The eyes are masked by mischievous
thoughts, is it right or wrong...
Your waist is Mongolia...
Your hip is Nigeria...
Your waist area is
enchanting Manchuria...
Your fastness is like a cyclone...
Your prowess is Siberia...
Your swift like mafia...
l'm finished...
Your beauty is soft like cotton...
Your eyes are fire spewing extremists...
l'm a python and you're a young doe...
l'm hungty and can't hold on...
There wasn't any war here...
there wasn't any bloodshed...
But my heart stopped
with your sight...
Neither my sari nor my dot
got displaced...
Let my beauty blossom in
the heat of your passion...
You're on the threshold of pleasure...
Ready to get caged in your desires...
Let me leave the mole of pleasure and
tattoo of happiness on you forever...
Why are you still here?
Somebody tried to kill a man here.
They took him to the near by
hospital in an ambulance.
lt's good for you to leave
the place immediately.
lf he survives,
Niharika's life will be in danger.
Find Niha and leave immediately.
Who is it?
l brought him to the near by hospital.
- Good.
You saved a police officer.
There's evety possibility he
could be attacked again.
Take him to a city hospital immediately.
l'll alert the others.
- Okay sir.
He tried to tell something on phone,
he must live at any cost.
Don't stop, you keep going.
You...?
What's this?
What you're seeing is true!
How could you kill a man?
He has no right to live, Niha.
You move away.
You don't have any right to kill.
He's fighting for life.
Leave him.
Niha, you are...
l've promised to kill him, move away.
What about our love then?
My love for you is as true
as l want to kill him.
lf you kill him now,
our love too dies with him.
Promise or love which is
more important to you?
Promise is important.
Check it!
lt's empty, bhai.
Something fell on our car.
- Nothing, you go on.
No, l heard sound, let's check.
He killed police somewhere
but his body is here.
What's our position now?
Why is bad time hell bent on us?
lf anyone sees,
they may think we killed him.
What shall we do now?
Boss, an idea.
- What's it?
Let's take him to hospital saying
he has met with an accident.
Nobody will suspect us.
- He's right.
Firs time you talked and
gave a good idea.
Let's go to city with the body.
You brought him at right time.
- ls he dead?
He's alive, he needs surgety,
pay Rs.5 lakhs immediately.
Rs.5 lakhs?
l forgot, l think his kidney too is
damaged, another Rs.5 lakhs,
pay immediately Rs.10 lakhs.
- Rs.10 lakhs?
We got trapped.
They're plundering money
for a dead man.
Whose idea was it?
- His!
Give your address, phone number
and pay Rs.10 lakhs. Do it fast.
Police!
lt's danger to run away,
if we stay with
Ajju bhai, nobody will suspect.
We'll be update with information.
We've blocked all the hospitals,
we've alerted evetyone.
He can't leave this city, bhai.
Bhai, we've info on him, he's Tony,
special officer went for him only.
He's a small time goon in Mumbai.
Bhai, l think he's the same Mumbai Tony.
He has a lover too.
Lover?
Let's kill her, he'll come to us.
You were right in saying
not to believe Tony.
Where did you go away, Niha?
l searched everywhere for you.
Tony is not a right man.
He killed evetyone mercilessly
right before my eyes.
Why is it happening to me only?
Niha, you know only that
he's killing people.
But l know why is he killing
and for whom.
Tell me where are you?
He didn't even blink to kill me
also for stopping him.
He'll not leave also if he
comes to know.
Don't think madly.
You be careful.
l'm coming home.
Are you Tony's lover?
l'm saying you.
Are you Tony's lover?
Yes.
Where is he?
- l don't know.
Tell me.
- l don't know.
You'll die if you don't tell me.
You mean...is she his lover?
Why are you covering for her?
What's happening here?
He's killing my men.
She's helping me.
The other girl is our target.
- She doesn't know anything.
That's why she helped you.
Do you know then?
l know.
l know you'll die in his hands.
Tell me, where is he?
- l'll not tell.
lf you die, she'll tell me.
Sorty dear, we didn't know
she was your friend.
l came to know she has
information about Tony.
By the time we reached here,
he killed her.
He's a gangster in Mumbai.
A professional killer who will
do anything for money.
He escaped from there and came here.
He's killing innocents like her.
Such criminals must be
shot down on roads.
We're scared of how many
more lives he may take.
Only you can help us to catch him.
Just a small clue about him will do.
Kill him sir!
l know where you can find him.
He mustn't live.
Kill him sir.
How come he got caught so easily?
He didn't get caught,
if he opens mouth we'll be caught.
Ajju bhai is coming!
The world is searching me
and l came in search of you.
You know why?
Not because you're some big fish.
You're a small time thug in Mumbai,
and you dared to take on me, Ajju bhai,
there's something big behind you.
Who is behind you?
He's asking about us.
Would he tell him?
Who?
- Don't know.
l hate this word don't know.
Tell me.
You'll die, tell me.
We're finished,
just a step away from us.
Still l don't know.
You're not important to me.
Who paid you? Tell me.
The bullet fired at you is coming
and right before you,
why are you bothered about
the gun that fired long back?
You're the only man who survived
for so long taking on me.
You're the only man who survived
for so long after l decided to kill.
You could've killed me there,
why did you come here?
Visa problem bhai, l tried my best.
Are we tourists to get visas easily,
we're criminals, right?
They refused.
- You're vety proud.
How much you got paid to kill me?
- Rs.1 crore.
You refuse to pay us salaty
but paid him Rs.1 crore.
He's covering us perfectly.
Just one crore to kill Ajju bhai.
l should've killed for free but l've
expenses, right? So took money.
l'll pay you Rs.100 crores now,
just give me the name of him.
Rs.100 crores?
- Yes, Rs.100 crores.
He'll tell now.
l promised bhai.
l can't take it back, l must kill you.
He's a mad man.
He'll commit to kill even for Rs.100.
l can't tolerate this anymore.
Come.
- Boss.
You're not afraid of death,
what do you fear then?
Mother, father, lover...
l left your lover after getting
my hands on her.
Love is vety powerful, right?
l got you boy!
Bring her!
Not a man can out from here.
lf your heart beats 72 times for a
minute, mine is just 40 times.
Let it stay in 40!
lf you tty to go out,
it'll race up to 70's,
and it'll create a havoc!
Go boys!
You can't go out of the gate.
You can't even move your finger.
What makes you so confident?
Hot blood, bulging nerves,
angty heart, bulging muscles,
unlimited pride, destroying futy,
and an unchanging brain.
This is my body structure.
Provoke anyone of this,
it's vety dangerous, bhai.
But if you provoke my heart which loves,
you'll see a Tsunami here!
l'm also itching to see Tsunami.
l'm going myself for your lover.
l'm going out of the gate
and killing her.
lf you've guts, stop me.
What l heard about in Mumbai
is correct,
so many facets in one person?
vety man can imagine about you.
Now another new facet.
You're a chameleon.
When you know so much about me,
why did you dare come near me?
No!
For whom you tried to stop us,
she's coming here.
lnfact she helped us in catching you.
You said your pulse will race
to 70 if we touch her.
What would happen if you know
she ordered us to kill you?
She's coming here to kill you.
Tell me at least now,
who paid you to kill me?
He's telling us
why he's doing all this?
You kill him.
Chithra is dead.
They killed her.
Tony is good man.
Who did this?
The man you helped now.
Tony is doing all this...
You refused my love for the promise
given to someone to kill him.
l'm asking you as your lover,
kill that bastard!
Kill the man who killed Chithra.
Don't leave anyone, kill all of them.
Kill all of them.
Promise to kill the man
who killed Chithra.
Promise to kill evetyone of them
who killed my family.
Kill them!
There's nothing l don't know.
At least now tell me,
who paid to kill me?
The girl who ordered to kill you now
is the one who paid me to kill you.
Few days later...
Tony you didn't kill an ordinaty man,
his deeds are out in paper.
Look at this.
lt seems he was an honest police officer.
They killed his entire family.
His death has brought out the truth
that he was a police officer.
How happy anyone from
his family would be now!
Forget about them,
are you happy now?
l'm vety happy!
Boss!
Entire thing is ours!
l've shifted to Malaysia
from Hyderabad.
Because of you l'm in Ajju's position now.
Last evening l got a call from
ltalian mafia, what was his name?
Shut up!
Jiju bhai!
l've changed my name to Jiju bhai,
isn't it good?
Rocking boss.
Yes, evetyone is using Jiju bhai
except you,
you're not using him
from the beginning.
please use him.
- Please use him.
Why me?
- Please use!
No boss, my dream of seeing you
as a big don has been realised,
that's enough for this life.
Brother.
- Boss.
Brother, nobody has used in this world
my brother-in-law like you,
he can't understand he's now in this
position because of your usage,
he won't listen to me,
if you keep an eye on me
and concentrate little,
l'll occupy my brother-in-law's place.
Once l start beating, l'll not rest.
