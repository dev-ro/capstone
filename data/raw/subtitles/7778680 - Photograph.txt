Let me put today

Miloni!
Hey, Miloni!
Miloni!
Rafi!
Rafi!
How's business?
This girl,
she had me take a photo.
I was looking for the envelope
and she ran off.
- Ran off?
- Ran off.
She pulled the wool
over your eyes.
She'll be in Dadar by now.
Rafi bhai,
I called the village yesterday.
Your grandmother was in
our village asking about girls.
My aunt has four.
Your aunt with the mustache?
Yes, but the girls
don't have mustaches.
- You marry them, then.
- No, not me!
Your body has amassed
all this anger.
Your grandmother
is right to worry.
She said she'd pay a dowry
for you if she had the money.
What do you say?
What should I say?
If you get married,
at least you'll have
a warm body next to you
at night.
You can go to the zoo
with the kids,
an evening out with the wife...
Yeah, right.
The wife and kids will be
in the village
while I'll be stuck here
pining for them.
- You don't do it, either.
- Why not?
You'd become a softie,
like Zakir bhai.
Softie?
- What's a softie?
- Never eaten a softie?
A softie is like ice cream.
Like kulfi, but not as hard.
It's so soft,
it melts in your mouth.
Softie.
It melts in your mouth?
So what use is it, madam?
That's what I'm saying!
How much do you need to send
home this month, Rafi bhai?
All of it, madam.
Here. This, too.
Keep something for yourself,
too, Rafi miyan.
Want a kulfi?
Why do you always eat kulfi
only at the end of the month?
- My father, when he was alive...
- Hey, Rafi miyan!
What's this I hear?
Your grandmother stopped taking
her medicine?
Because you won't select
a bride?
Where did you hear that, uncle?
His grandmother was asking
around my wife's village.
What kind of girl do you want?
You've never told me.
Well, you should've told me!
Look at that.
No one appreciates help

Two kulfis.
Rafi miyan, has Grandma really
stopped taking her medicine?
It's high time you got married.
Rafi miyan?
Is it true what I heard
about your grandma?
And then Rafi throws the kulfi
right in his face.
[laughter]
Then he says,
"I heard you like sweets,
son of a bitch!"
Rafi bhai,
if a boat isn't anchored
at the right time,
- it can sink.
- [laughter]
Absolutely, Rafi.
100%, you'll sink!
- He wants you to drown!
- Let me tell you something.
Remember what I told you
about Tiwari?
Zakir bhai,
not that story again.
Let me tell it one more time.
Don't play
that old record again.
You get too emotional.
Go on.
So this is what happened,
Rafi miyan:
I woke up one morning
and really had to pee,
but it was really hot.
So I'm thinking,
"Why is it so bloody hot?"
And I look up
and see that the fan
has stopped,
but Tiwari is swinging.
He had hanged himself.
So Zakir peed right then
and there.
[laughing, chattering]
Rafi miyan, think about it:
that man left without a word.
He didn't even leave a note.
Not even a note.
Who would he write it to,
anyway?
To this day,
to this day,
I can hear that man swinging...
from this fan. Even now.
[shuffling cards]
I swear in God's name he still
paces around this room at night!
Enough Zakir bhai,
you're ruining the party.
[laughter]
Rafi miyan, you should stop
sulking like this.
Stop worrying
about your grandma.
My mother,
she used to call
and bug me all the time.
It got so bad, I could barely
drive my rickshaw anymore.
The food is delicious,
Rampyaari.
Thank you, didi.
Son? Eat properly.
You have to finish it all.
He doesn't eat well, Saloni.
It's not just the food, Papa.
It's the same with his studies.
If you don't study, what
will you be when you grow up?
An actor!
[light laughter]
You know, Miloni wanted to be an
actress when she was in school.
Really?
The teachers in school, my God!
They gave her trophy
after trophy for drama.
You won trophies?
Finally I had to go and tell
them, stop giving her prizes!
If she does drama all the time,
when will she have time
for her academics?

Most adventurous young lady!
I remember your grandfather.
He used to bring you in
when you were this little.
You used to love that cola.
Which one was it?
- Campa Cola.
- Campa Cola, that's it!
Don't worry at all. It's
a very simple case of gastro.
Doctor.
She should know better than
eating things on the street.
[doctor chuckling]
The longer I live,
the more pain I have.
But the longer I live,
the pain hurts less.
If your daughter eats
street food every day,
she'll become immune to it.
She has her CA Inter exams
coming up.
CA Inter exam?
Young lady?
No street food it is!
Mr. Shah?
Here's the prescription.
You can pick it up outside...
Rafi?
- Hey, Rafi!
- Hmm?
Wake up! Stop this hmmm, hmmm!
I don't understand.
Why didn't she come today?
I hope she's okay.
I told you not
to make her eat ice candy.
She must've fallen ill
because of you. What else?
How could she fall ill?
I mean,
we all ate the same thing.
Go to sleep, Dadi.
How can I sleep, son?
Where did you find such
a delicate girl
who eats just one ice candy
and falls sick?
Don't worry, Dadi jaan.
My Ruksana
was also very delicate.
Her family pampered her a lot.
After we got married, she
adjusted to our circumstances.
Her parents must've given her
a comfortable life.
Rafi's love will help her
digest ice candy someday.
Don't worry. Go to sleep.
Sleep now.
[Dadi groaning quietly]
[creaking]
What's that sound?
Tiwari has just joined us.
Who's Tiwari?
Tiwari is our resident ghost.
We've all heard his steps, Dadi.
No one gets peace in Mumbai,
not even in death.
Easy, easy. Careful.
[chatter continues]
Good-bye, friends.
Parting is hard.
I'll miss you a lot.
[music playing,
audience cheering over TV]
[quiet chatter]
Don't trouble yourself, Dadi.
It's no trouble at all,
my child.
I told him
to bring Noorie along,
but she's studying
for her exams.
Poor girl.
She's all alone in the hostel.
Had she come,
she would've loved your biryani.
It's very good.
Very tasty, really.
[engine starts]
[horns honking]
Evening outing, sir?
Very good.
Are you from up north, sir?
- Haan.
- Ah.
I knew it the moment you spoke!
I'm from Gonda, and you?
Balia.
Balia!
What are the odds?
Your home is only 40 kilometers
from mine!
I can leave my house at dawn and
be at your house by breakfast!
Have you been to his village,
madam?
No?! You should definitely go.
You'll love it.
You know, madam?
A friend of mine, my roommate,
his wife was also from Mumbai...
Brother,
please focus on your driving.
This is my daily work.
This is what I do every day:
talk and drive.
One eye on the road, always.
So where were we, madam?
Getting back to my friend
and his wife...
Why should we care
about your friend?
Be quiet and focus on driving,
please.
You know what?
This is too much!
One moment, I'm your brother
from the village.
The next, I'm a stranger.
You told me to shut my mouth!
I didn't tell you
to shut your mouth.
I just told you to...
drive safely.
That's all I said.
Sir, I'm an educated man.
When did I say you weren't?
I have an M.A.
from Banaras Hindu University
in English Literature.
It's all God's will.

Mm, mm.

Gafoor bhai told me
you'd know where I can find it.
It's been years since anyone
came looking for Campa Cola.
You're the first.
There must be a Campa factory
somewhere.
It's a big country.
Correct.
The country is big.
But the country's memory
is very small.
[clicks tongue, sighs]
Many years ago, a man came here,
just like you,
a Parsi gentleman.
His wife loved Campa Cola.
When the factories
started closing down,
he bought the Campa Cola formula
and set up a factory
in his house
so his wife
could keep having Campa.
He must still make it, right?
I don't know.
I don't know
