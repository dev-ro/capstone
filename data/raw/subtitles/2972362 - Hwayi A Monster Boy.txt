A JANG JOON-HWAN FILM
Something was there.
Lurking in the stretching
darkness.
Don't touch the bag.
We're fucked.
We've got customers.
They called the cops?
What happened?
The operation was kept
confidential.
Yeah.
I'm telling now 'cause
I just found out.
Who's on?
Beom-soo.
Can you get him off?
We'll try.
We've got cops on board.
Why do parents take
their children for granted?
I'll give it to you for $1.
Just a single dollar
If you look here...
Hey, mister, can I take
a look at that?
Of course. If you look here,
the blade is...
Hey... Throw the knife away.
Hey, is that a gun?
Shit, let's just jump him.
There's just one bullet left!
Aw, shit.
Hey, don't lose it!
Hey, asshole!
Let go of him!
Come over here! Quick!
Get... get behind me...
Oh, I'm sorry...
This is nicely sharpened.
Real sharp.
Beom-soo's a lazy bum,
but he makes one hell of a gun.
You should've seen
those cops' faces.
Is that a gun? Is that a gun?
Buh... bury it?
Buh... but it's still alive!
It's all withered.
No good anymore.
Let's end things here.
It's just too risky.
If they hear he's still alive
they'll definitely... pay up.
Won't they?
This is so not my style.
That's for me to decide.
Got it?
Thuh... then... we're good,
right?
Aw... he's throwing up.
Is... is he sick?
I'm telling you it's gone bad...
Aw... gross!
Young-joo!
Come here for a sec!
Peek-a-boo!
Oh, Young-joo!
He... he's cute...
Whuh... what should we
call him?
SPRING 1998
This afternoon, a gang of
masked robbers hit a bank...
The police are searching
for the suspects...
Unrevealing their faces and
dodging surveillance cameras...
Their nickname, Day Breakers
came from their daring capers...
during broad daylight.
A warehouse robbery today...
Nevertheless, their trademark...
untraceable work,
handmade weapons...
and unusual crime technique
are baffling the police...
The Day Breakers case is
shocking the nation.
A community credit coop
was raided by armed...
HWAYI: A MONSTER BOY
You're as good as they say.
What happened to your eyes?
I was born like this.
Then, you've never seen
anything your entire life?
I can actually see
things close up.
Are you expecting someone, sir?
Huh?
I can hear someone outside.
I can't hear a thing.
But someone's here...
They're here...
Who... who the hell
are you?
And, done!
Hey!
Hey! Do you know who I am,
you fucking crooks?
I know!
Open it.
Bribe money's gotta be laundered
ASAP 'cause everyone knows now.
It's just some silly rumor.
I'll do it, I'll do it!
But...
It's actually this hand.
Think wisely. 'Cause I'm not
in the mood for liars.
I'm not lying.
It's this hand, this one.
Open it.
Hey you motherfuckers!
You shouldn't have
underestimated me.
Consider this your lucky day.
I'm not in the mood for trouble.
So get the hell out!
Don't you get it?
Since I haven't seen your faces,
just beat it!
Now you've seen me.
Kill him.
May I?
Yes, kill him.
Yuck! Shit...
Hey, he's dead! Dead!
What a fucking psycho.
You sure know how to hit
the right spot.
SUNGJI (HOLY LAND)
So you really can't see a thing?
I... I can't...
Whatcha doin?
Aren't ya gonna kill him?
There he goes again...
When the cops come, remember.
You never saw ME,
but I saw YOU.
Okay?
Hurry up!
Hurry, get up close!
Hey, which way did they go?
- Hey, to the left, to the left!
- Aw, shit!
WINTER 2012
Hey, school boy!
Can you lend me a hand?
I've seen you a few times.
You live around here,
don't you?
Which school wears that uniform?
I guess you don't wanna
talk to me, right?
Hey, school boy,
what's your name?
Hwayi...
My name is Hwayi.
Hwayi?
What an unusual name.
Bye, Hwayi!
Thanks for the orange!
Why kill him when he couldn't
call the cops anyway?
That dude's morally fucked up.
He's just a crook.
But he's an ex-prosecutor.
This could get us in deep shit.
You...
should've finished the job.
Why let the other guy go?
Why do you have to do
things on a whim?
- What's the use of planning...
- Enough, I get it.
Wasn't this the plan anyway?
That crook stashed so much
for himself it's hard counting.
Let's go to the
public bathhouse later.
I don't want to.
What's the big deal?
Shit!
Little twerp.
- I'm home.
- Hey!
Hwuh, Hwayi
Whi, which way did you come?
I... I kept watching for you.
The orchard.
You should've called me.
Whuh, why bother walking?
Son!
Great job today.
You deserve this.
Duh... don't give too much
muh... money to the kid.
A real man should have
a fat pocket, right?
This will make my pocket
fat enough.
Any problems on the way?
No, dad.
Good job today.
Yes, father.
Fruh, from now on,
call me, okay?
Did I ever mention I was
craving for this?
No, but they're your favorite
anyway.
Let's split one. Wait...
Hey, Beom-soo. What did you
do to the bullet?
- Did he hit it? Let me see.
- Nice... He totalled it.
Nice! We should get him
into the Olympics.
It looks like our son's
great at everything.
- Stop practicing...
- Let's eat.
Come here. Come, Hwayi.
But Beom-soo, where would
we use these bullets?
Korea's all about blades.
Hwayi, let's have a blade fight
after dinner, okay?
Suk-tae's getting more
fucked up with age.
He's getting more and more
crazier.
He should think of the people
cleaning up after his shit.
He can't go on shitting
all over my territory...
What about the blind guy?
Who cares? He's scared shitless
but you never know.
In my opinion,
Suk-tae has no vision.
You and I need to be swimming
in bigger waters.
Hey! Want me to fix you up
with Mr. JEON from Incheon?
Who?
You know, Mr. JEON Seung-ki
from Incheon.
Now that's a man with a vision!
You call that vision? It's just
gangsters doing business.
He's not the same man
you used to know.
He's handling all the big
redevelopment projects
in the metropolitan area.
The dude is now holding the,
veins of Korea.
You don't say?
They're on a redevelopment
project in our district.
But one house is giving them
a headache 'cause they won't budge.
How about removing them?
We're no mercenary gangsters.
They've already tried that
shit on these people.
Breaking.
Threatening.
Torching.
But they just won't budge.
And legally they have the right.
We have no other choice
but... to kill them off.
So, why won't these people
move out?
That's the fucked up part.
IM Hyung-taek lives there.
Who? LEE Myung-taek?
No you moron, IM Hyung-taek,
the owner of Sungji Cement!
You can go wild
on your asking price.
And if the job's done well,
you'll get your network with
Mr. JEON and your vision.
- How about it? Are you in?
- Hey...
I'm a bit busy now.
Let's talk later.
Busy? Are you kidding me?
What the fuck...
You're not busy at all...
After a 3 month language course,
you can start school.
And this too.
Memorize the name
and date of birth.
Basic things, that
I'll take care of,
but for the time being...
you're on your own, okay?
Okay. I'll talk to him.
Trust me. You'll regret this bad
if you don't do this.
I'll leave you two to talk.
What's going on?
I'm going out.
Where to?
Downtown.
You're going out quite
often these days.
Are you wearing that again?
I prefer this.
'Cause it doesn't stand out.
You've grown again.
So he wants to go?
We should let him go.
It's what we agreed on.
Did we?
We can't keep him here like this.
Hwayi's different from us.
Different...
You used to be different,
weren't you?
So what's his excuse
for staying?
That IM Hyung-taek?
SEOKHWAWON GARDENING
A car accident!
You crazy bastard!
You wanna get killed?
Your eyes aren't
there for fun, asshole!
I almost crashed into you!
Jesus!
You're good!
Are you gonna apply
for art school?
Doesn't it cost a lot?
Are your parents okay with it?
I'm so jealous.
I'd like to study photography...
But they want me to quit.
It costs too much.
Hey, can you draw me?
Huh?
I'm supposed to draw
a self-portrait for my art class.
Don't try to be so perfect.
Go easy with the drawing.
Okay? How about Saturday?
Okay.
Really? Great! I was dying to
get out of this assignment.
I'll take your photo in exchange.
Wait... something's missing.
Here, bite on this.
Okay, that's good!
And I did it again!
An artist never blames the material.
Your number!
I'll send it to you.
Look! Look!
There's a pervert over there!
Have another drink.
Stop enticing me, sweetheart.
- Let me have a little squeeze.
- Not this!
Jeez, that dude is totally whack!
- Let's have another drink.
- Hwayi... Hwayi!
You?
Hwayi!
You know that guy?
Yeah...
He's my dad.
Who's that next to him?
Stop drinking and driving.
- It's dangerous.
- Who could it be, who?
Who are you talking about?
I don't know.
Wuh... want me to teach you
how to get girls?
No thanks.
First.
Screw her.
Then you're halfway there.
Yeah, halfway... Just her body.
Then guh... go for the kill
and grab her heart.
Like how?
Look carefully.
This, this is the asshole.
This one huh... this one's
the hole, the hole.
And this one's the one
I told you about.
Right here, get it real wet.
And then, just do this.
And go at it.
Dad, dad, how come you're
always talking like that?
And for a big one,
you just have to...
Dad, dad...
What?
Aw come on...
Hey, slow down a bit,
a bit, a little bit.
Slow down.
I'm glad I'm not driving.
My face totally shows.
But dad...
I'm in my school uniform.
So stop wearing that uniform!
You're not even in school!
They'll notice your uniform.
Loo, look down.
- Hey, isn't that a high school student?
- Go, go, go.
Go, go!
Get them!
Hurry, get in the car!
If... if it was me. I... I'd have
ditched those fuckers by now.
Sir, sir!
Why, those sons-of-bitches!
Step on the brakes and
slow the speed down.
Sir, slow the speed down,
the speed!
That's it, so you wanna play,
you motherfuckers?
There, over there...
intersection...
Grab the side brakes...
Nuh, nuh, now! NOW!
We're good! We're good!
What the fuck.
Hey, you sons-of-bitches!
Good job. But your timing
wuh... was a bit off...
Your cue was a bit off!
It was? No...
It's 'cause you said
nun... nun... now!
When did I say nuh, nuh, now?
I said, now!
So you think you can
make fun of me?
You know what I'll be
doing to you!
- Cut off your dick and eat it!
- I know! Stop!
That's not the same story
you first gave me!
You can't keep changing
your story like this.
Day Breakers or not,
this isn't working. Let him go.
Got it, sir.
May I try?
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?
Intercity Investigation Crime Affairs,
Det. CHOI Jeong-min.
You can't see this?
Really?
Sir, who the hell's that asshole?
Master CB CHOI Jeong-min.
CB?
Crazy Bastard. He's got
a grudge against the Day Breakers.
He's known for his creativity.
So let's see how he does.
So, you can't see...
What the...
Your pupils tell me you can see.
Why claim you can't see
when you can?
Were you threatened?
Did they tell you to
keep your mouth shut?
Is that why you won't
say anything?
Fine. Then you may leave.
Huh?
We're done, you're free to go.
Really?
I'll tell the press you can see.
And that you've seen
the killer's face.
If they're the right guys,
they'll come to get you.
Then I'll sweep in! And nab 'em.
So get the hell out of here.
Shit, didn't I tell you to
get the hell out?
Hey, KIM!
We don't need him anymore,
so see him out!
- What?
- Are you out of your mind?
URGENT, THE POLICE
There was a scent.
I smelled this scent on him.
A scent?
I smelled Chinese Juniper
on his hands.
It's about 8 years old.
They were... laughing.
Even while they were
handling the body.
Just laughing...
Hello.
You saw his face, right?
His eyes...
They weren't human.
He was...
Torn skin should be stitched up
quickly or else it'll fester.
Do you get what I mean?
Yes.
Take it.
Get ready.
No need to be afraid.
Just think of it as a pig's head.
Pull the trigger.
Shoot!
Is... is it cold?
Wuh... want me to turn
the heater on?
It's so cold! I'm freezing!
Why can't you leave
the boy alone?
You crazy fuck!
Let go of him!
Father... Father...
Father... Father...
Why didn't you shoot him?
Tell me.
I... I saw the monster...
Monster?
Do you see it?
Do you see it now?
Do you?
I don't think I can do it.
What?
Say that again.
I don't want to do it, father.
Why not?
Everyone else is,
so why can't you?
You think you're different
from your dads?
You think you're all clean?
Is that it?
Yeah, your dad is dirty.
And that embarrasses you.
Is that why you're running away?
Is it?
Forgive me, forgive me, father.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
Then I guess you should
be punished.
You tell me then.
If you made a mistake
you should be punished, right?
Okay...
I'll get rid of the monster.
I'll get rid of it for you.
That dirty monster.
No, father, no! No!
There's a monster in here!
It's gonna get me!
Stop being a wuss.
Monster or not, don't turn away.
Look it straight in the eyes!
And it'll go away.
Father... Father!
Father!
Don't come near! Go away!
Go away! Go!
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!
Father! Father! Forgive me!
Father! Forgive me!
FATHER!
Let's do the job.
That IM Hyung-taek.
We can't just let him
stay like that.
It's a 30% advance.
There are just two requests.
Make it look like a robbery.
And finish the job by
Sunday morning.
What? Tomorrow?
He's losing $300,000 daily
just in interest 'cause of them.
They go to church on Sundays.
We'll break in then and wait.
How long will it take?
The locks look like imports.
I guess 10 minutes at the least?
Hell no! There are a lot of eyes
watching with the construction.
And IM's public grievances
have cops patrolling the area.
It's too risky.
There'll be witnesses.
I... I agree.
Let's not do it, okay?
Suk-tae?
YOO-KYUNG
YOU HAVE 4 MISSED CALLS
You should go to the hospital.
Is it those people again?
Just finish your meal.
You think... we should give up?
Go.
Juh... just do as you're told.
Just open the door and guh...
get the hell out.
O, okay?
Ah! An... and...
Duh... don't get yourself wet...
Stupid weather!
Why's it raining all of a sudden?
Hey, is this where you sleep
when you run away from home?
Aw, I told you we're no
runaways!
Officer PARK, wait.
Sir?
Is there a kid living
in that house?
Hey!
Hey, kid!
Wait.
Hey, kid!
I'm home.
SOMEPNES IN THR HOUSR
TO 'HUSBAND'
SOMEPNES IN THR HOUSR
FROM 'WIFE'
Excuse me...
Uh? Our son's left
his footprints here.
What is it? Something wrong?
No.
The first time's always hard.
Still you did well, son.
Put these on first.
Yes, dad.
Son.
Always wear these when entering
another person's house, okay?
Okay.
Since you're already inside,
take a look around.
Why isn't Hwayi coming out?
Get him out first...
Wait.
112, POLICE
112, this is the police.
Who's there?
What are you doing!
Aren't you praying today?
You like praying, don't you?
Who the hell are you?
Your wife, where's your wife?
I don't know who you are, but...
Tell me.
Where's your wife?
The country...
to visit her parents.
Where in the country?
- How about some hot soup?
- Not that again!
What's up with that lady?
Hey, lady! What's wrong?
What is it? Hey!
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, lady!
Wake up, lady! Hey!
Lady, lady!
Hey, lady!
I lost her.
Theh... then I... I'll guh, go...
Hey, mister.
Do you know that lady over there?
Hey.
Kill him.
You...
Move!
What are you doing?
There's no time.
Take it.
Shoot him.
Didn't you hear me?
Kill him.
Wait.
Shoot him.
Shoot!
Shoot again.
Shoot...
Shoot...
Are you by any chance...
SHOOT!
- So, you didn't catch his face?
- No.
Then how do you know
he's a student?
He was in a school uniform.
Uniform? Which school?
Uh, well...
It was raining hard, and school
uniforms all look alike...
Hey, hey!
You think a kid would
do a thing like that?
Huh?
Fucking school uniform, my ass.
Where would he get
a goddamn gun? Huh?
Ever see a kid carry a gun?
Chief!
KIM Sun-ja says she's seen
one of their faces.
What?
She says he was in
a school uniform.
Hey.
Do you believe her?
She seems disoriented.
She has been kind of
in and out of it.
Hey, Chief.
I went to see Mr. JEON's
people and
- I don't think it's them.
- How come?
All employees were on
a company field trip.
They said they can give us
recordings of it.
I knew it!
You think they're stupid?
This is a grudge crime. 100%.
I've been asking around and
these people have a great
reputation in the neighborhood.
They kept to themselves except
for their Sungji Foundation work.
But they're rich,
that's the thing.
No one gets rich without
stepping all over someone else.
Look hard and you'll find
some typical grudge.
Try looking harder.
Al... righty...
Doesn't this look like the
Day Breakers' work?
Nope, something's messy
about this one.
Scour every high school nearby.
Men or work...
It's no good when
other people do your job.
'Cause they're not thinking
like you.
Don't you agree?
I am deeply sorry, sir.
How is KIM Sun-ja doing?
She's in shock and hospitalized.
Poor woman.
When can she be discharged?
We're not sure yet.
Forgive me, sir.
Where do you think people
die the most?
Don't you think you should
pay her a visit?
Yes, sir.
Huh?
Goddamn weather.
14TH PAJU FLORICULTURE DAY
Floriculture...
How could you do this to me?
Why the fuck did you take
the boy with you? Shit.
You think they hired you
'cause they're scared to kill?
Do you know how fucked you'll be
if things go wrong with JEON?
How could you make
such a fucking mess like this?
I'm caught in the middle...
What are we gonna do now?
We'll just have to wait and see
how the Incheon boys react.
If things go wrong,
Hwayi could be in danger.
You already had this in mind
for Hwayi, didn't you?
Round up three plants and
tie them with ribbons.
We're making a delivery
to Ilsan tomorrow.
You should eat something.
Aren't you going to get up?
Are you sick?
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.
Where did you find this photo?
You were such an adorable child.
Your eyes looked just like...
You know...
The dog with big ears like this.
Your face changed as you grew.
That's...
not me.
It isn't?
But it is.
It's you.
PAJU FLORICULTURE ASSOCIATION
It's from this place, right?
Right. I think we gave out
about 200?
200?
As you can see,
our association is quite big.
Then can I get a list of
Chinese juniper farms?
Chinese juniper?
What kind?
It's just 'cause there's so many
goddamn kinds.
Shit, there's so goddamn many...
Shit! It's chipped.
Shit!
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Where's Hwayi?
Where is Hwayi?
Huh?

CHANG-HO
Speak.
A high school boy found
KIM Sun-ja hanging herself.
Where's your boy?
I'm on my way to the hospital.
I'll see you there.
Where's Hwayi?
I don't know.
When I got here, he was gone.
Aw, it's so fucking cold.
Are you sure Hwayi called
the cops?
Are you in denial?
What are you thinking?
What about the kid?
We can't just let him run loose.
And if we do?
But KIM Sun-ja has seen
his face.
We can't just let him
run loose like this.
If she's seen him, shouldn't you
be asking what we'll do to her?
Why are you doing this to me,
goddamn it...
Have you found Hwayi?
He's not home yet?
A cop came by this afternoon.
I'm getting a bad feeling.
Once we find him
we're sending him away.
And what if he refuses?
Then I'll take him out myself!
We'll talk when I get home.
JNU CONSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION
JEON SEUNG-KI...
Are you gonna go with me?
Is that you, Hwayi?
But...
I don't think
I'll be able to go.
What're you talking about?
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick.
I went back to that house.
Where I killed that man.
The child in the photo.
Is it a child you know?
Hwayi, I'm not sure
what you're thinking,
- but Young-joo is all wrong.
- The child...
Do you know who he is?
You must be tired. We'll talk
tomorrow. Go to your room.
What the hell is this?
- Tell me the truth.
- About what?
Who the child is.
I want to know.
The only thing you should
know is that I raised you.
Those folks.
Do you know why they
refused to leave?
What?
They were waiting.
Just in case their child returns.
Dad...
You knew all along, didn't you?
Put the gun down!
Then why!
Why didn't you stop them?
I said, put the gun down!
WHY?
Why?
INCHEON HOSPITAL
I'll keep this short.
We're tying loose ends at the hospital
and we need your help.
And what about me?
You think I'm your fucking dog?
Detective.
I don't tolerate
such filthy language.
And I don't take shit from
some gang banging punk.
Hey.
How would it reflect on me
if you made a mess while I'm here.
Tell me, PARK Ji-won,
you fuck?
Come on.
Who do you think I am?
Just 'cause I've done some work
for you lately,
you think I'm your dog?
Is that it?
What a piece of crap.
- Does it even work?
- Yeah.
When I'm using it on fuckers
like you, mothafucka!
Is your hearing okay?
What's that, asshole?
Tell me. Is this one
empty or not?
Who do you think I am?
Tell me!
Who do you think I am?
What was that?
I can't hear you, speak up.
Who do you think I am?
You've got it all wrong.
You're not in charge. It's me.
Okay?
Buh, bye.
Fucking asshole!
Stop!
Here, here.
Look at that son-of-a-bitch's
timing.
Can we get one from
another angle?
Yes. There's one right here,
so take a look.
Shit!
Every fucking farm is growing
Chinese juniper trees!
Why does it have to be
Chinese junipers...
Fucking shit...
Why can't it be something
more rare.
PEACE NURSING HOME
Thank you.
It's done.
Thank you.
It's just for one day.
Why are you out here?
Go inside.
What's wrong?
Didn't you say she's your mom?
You're not gonna go inside?
Muh... mom...
Mom...
So...
You wanna kill me too?
Then you'll need one clean shot.
Or else you're 100% dead.
I heard you saved KIM Sun-ja
and killed Jin-sung.
What's with you?
We're the only ones
in your memory.
KIM Sun-ja's gonna die anyway.
Leave her alone!
I'll kill them.
Mr. JEON, the Incheon people...
I'll... I'll kill them all.
You?
Think wisely.
KIM Sun-ja must die
in order for you to live.
Hwayi...
Hwayi...
Hwayi!
Hwayi!
You're not really gonna shoot,
are you?
Come on. Can't catch him?
You want me to drive?
Don't shoot!
I... I... I'll... catch him.
Hwayi...
Wait!
Hwayi! Hwayi! Talk to me!
Let's talk! I'll listen!
Hwayi! Hwayi!
Hwayi!
That's enough. Now get him.
Gotcha! Step on it!
He was intending to
kill us, right?
- Yeah.
- What?
I tuh... taught him to do that.
DAY BREAKERS CASE
DON'T TOUCH!
Fucking moron!
You crazy bastard!
RANSOM NOTE
$1 MILLION, 3/24 AT 14:20
SUBWAY LINE 3, YANGJAE
Is that you, Hwayi?
I need to ask you something.
Why did you raise me?
What kind of question is that?
I'm your dad.
Where are you now?
Dad...
Are you gonna come to get me?
Of course.
The place you first took me to.
Bring everyone there by 10 am.
I'll be waiting.
Did you want to see me, sir?
What happened last night?
Sir, we had a small setback,
but we'll fix things soon.
The security guard
gave this to me.
IF YOU WANT KIM SUN-JA
BRING 5 TIMES THE BALANCE
TO THE SUNGJI CEMENT
FACTORY BY 9AM TODAY
Why are these people
doing this to me?
I never make any enemies...
You know that, right?
Yes, sir.
What's this?
Are we having a party?
You should look out
here for him.
Nuh, nuh, no, no.
I... I wanna go with you.
Do as Beom-soo says.
Duh... don't kill him. Okay?
You're late.
This way, please.
Aw, don't be rude.
Put your guns away.
I can tell from this place that
you've got
quite a romantic side to you.
But I must say
it's not my taste.
What's so funny?
We didn't call you here.
That won't do.
I've quintupled the balance
as you demanded.
So hand KIM Sun-ja over to us.
Who admitted this woman?
She said she was her daughter.
She was here a few minutes ago.
What's all this?
MS. YANG,
FEMALE, AGE 55
Is this all some kind of act?
So you didn't send this?
There's a number here.
Shall I try calling it?
What is this? Just tell him
to come inside.
I found KIM Sun-ja. If you're
whacking her, get over here.
Hey, PARK Ji-won,
are you listening?
Where are you?
Suk-tae?
Hwuh... Hwayi!
- Hwayi.
- Let go. Let go!
Stop... stop it.
You're just like them!
I... I'm here,
duh, dad's here...
You're just the same.
You fooled me like the others!
That's enough now.
Just stop...
Why should I? Why!
Why should I stop!
Dad will hold you, okay?
No! You're just like them!
Go away! Go!
GO AWAY!
Ah... Jeez...
Hwuh... Hwayi...
Dad...
I... I'm so suh, sorry... Hwayi.
Dad! No... no!
I... I'm really really sorry...
Hwayi... dad's so sorry for...
DAD!
Dad...
Hwayi, it's me. Some men are
looking for you.
What should I do?
Hey, are you listening?
Someone's inside.
I know, you fucking bitch!
Open the goddamn door!
Open the door!
Police.
May I come in?
What the fuck!
Hey, you asshole!
Who is this child?
Who is this kid here?
My son.
- Your son?
- Yes...
My son.
Ms. JANG Young-joo?
You're JANG Young-joo,
right? Born in 1971.
The owner of this house.
Your husband is YOON Suk-tae.
Your housemates are
YOON Ki-tae, LEE Jin-sung.
I don't see a son though.
He died. Two years ago.
Is that so?
I'm looking for these guys
called the Day Breakers.
This time they killed this man
named IM Hyung-taek.
They're known to be cold
and methodical.
So why so many bullets?
And traces of hesitation.
This could mean
the killer knows the victim.
Please get to the point
and leave.
You know IM Hyung-taek,
don't you?
- I don't.
- You don't?
YOON Suk-tae, YOON Ki-tae
and JANG Young-joo.
You all grew up at the Sungji
Orphanage in Incheon.
IM Hyung-taek's father was
the foundation's Chief Director.
Think carefully.
Are you sure you don't know?
That's why you gotta make
friends with the right people.
I wasn't always a bad person,
you know?
But... Shit...
I made the wrong friends.
And now I'm in deep shit.
You startled me,
you fucking asshole!
What about the kid?
Did you kill him?
She's on the 4th floor.
I've cleared the ward for
the job, so go get...
What?
Aw shit...
These fuckers are
the Day Breakers, right?
Get out.
You people also killed
IM Hyung-taek, right?
Who's this kid?
The student at the crime scene.
He's was in it as well,
wasn't he?
The kid's not dead, is he?
Hwayi...
Hwayi's a good boy.
It's not his fault.
Hwayi?
Hwayi tree...
What the fuck...
Did you people...
really raise the kid?
You never saw him
grow up, did you?
He was about this tall at first.
Now he's...
Ah, but you've
seen him before, right?
He's a good kid.
And mighty bright.
Whatever he's taught,
he learns fast.
He's good at drawing, too.
He's such a great kid,
but he has this sickness.
He keeps on seeing things.
When it's bad, he has fits.
It's heartbreaking to watch.
I guess he takes that after me.
I used to be like that.
Don't come near!
Or I'll kill you...
Don't come near...
Don't come near...
Or I'll kill you...
Hyung-taek...
I bet he had a heart
bigger than Jesus...
He was such a good person.
He said...
It was fear and anger
that tainted my soul.
And praying will make
the monster go away.
So I prayed really hard...
But it didn't fucking go away.
I was sick of it all.
Of every goddamn prayer
and monster.
So I screwed a girl he liked.
Oh, I liked her too,
but the bitch
didn't like me back.
So I...
Yeah?
Young-joo!
Once I got myself all dirty,
it finally went away.
That filthy monster.
Oh, god...
Do you get what I'm saying?
You have to become the monster
to make the monster go away.
But Hwayi went too far
with what he did today.
Don't you agree?
Don't worry.
Hwayi will get better
when it's all over.
Answer, for crying out loud!
- No...
- Shit! I've got them!
- The Day Breakers.
- Not Hwayi...
I'll give you the address
so send me backup!
Not Hwayi...
Why...
Why...
WHY!
I've tried to
figure that out myself.
Ask when you get up there.
He'd know for sure.
What's that?
A cop?
I'm impressed.
So, how was it?
It's no big deal, is it?
You wanna go to a place
that's warm?
You know? A place so hot
you can't even think.
Let's eat first, Hwayi's coming.
Not Hwayi, not him...
Didn't you hear me?
Make something to eat.
Make it yourself.
What?
Filthy bastard,
fucking son-of-a-bitch.
Make something to eat.
No... not anymore...
No?
Then why didn't you leave?
What more is left for you
to suck out of us?
Tell me.
You're scared, right?
'Cause it's scarier out there
now, right?
It's better in here, isn't it?
Everything you need is here.
I gave it all to you, right?
You're afraid, too, aren't you?
You were scared, too,
weren't you?
'Cause Hyung-taek and Hwayi
were different from you.
This scared you, right?
What the fuck
are you saying? Huh?
Stop.
Just let Hwayi go, please...
Stop?
Stop what?
I'm just getting started.
Hey.
Is that why you were waiting?
To run off with Hwayi?
Why? Isn't a toe enough?
Want me to cut
your throat this time?
Stop it.
See, I told you he'd come.
So what do you think?
Your home is the best place
to be, right?
Why did you kill her?
What? Who?
Why...
Why did you do it?
Why did you do that to me?
You said you were
seeing a monster.
You call that a reason?
Your dads are all monsters,
so you should become one too.
Right?
That way we can all
live together.
Live together?
What?
Are you still all confused?
Do you still think I'm dirty?
Think about it.
How dirty
you've become yourself.
Aren't you feeling
much better now?
You don't see it anymore,
do you?
Things like the monster.
No one moves!
I got you now,
you motherfuckers.
What do we have here?
A monster from the basement.
Don't move. I'm a cop,
you son-of-a-bitch!
Hey! Drop your gun!
So.
Who are you gonna shoot?
Me or the monster?
You fucking bitch...
So you think you're
better than me?
Stop.
Crazy bitch! Filthy bitch!
Stop it!
Am I so dirty?
Stop! Drop the gun, asshole!
You're fucking pieces of shit.
How dare you shoot my son?
Haven't you had enough?
So you hate everything
including your dad, huh?
Then you're on your own
from now on.
Don't!
Pull the trigger.
You fucking retard... KILL!
Stop...
Stop!
Why?
Why can't you pull the trigger?
Do you see the monster again?
Do you still see it?
No...
No...
No...
Not... anymore...
Forgive me...
Forgive me, father.
Get up.
No...
Hwayi... No...
Okay.
It's been hell for you,
hasn't it?
It's all over.
It's all over now.
Dad will take care of everything.
Me, your dad...
All I need is you.
Only you...
- Hey, stop running!
- Yes, ma'am.
- You sly bitch.
- Stop!
- What is it?
- He was really hot.
Who?
He asked me to
give this to you. A boy!
What is it?
Beats me. Open it, quick!
- Jeez!
- This is totally whack!
I wanted to get one,
but it's so expensive.
We're so jealous!
The guy...
The boy... where's he now?
The playing field... I guess?
Our special guests of honor
opening this historic moment
for Golden City are coming up
on stage! The mayor of Incheon.
What an amazing accomplishment!
See how this redevelopment
makes such a difference!
You know we still have
a long way to go.
Of course I do.
Do you mind if I stand
next to Mr. JEON?
You know it might start a scandal.
It's my pleasure to be linked
with him.
He's the heart of Korea now.
Congratulations, Mr. JEON.
Thank you for making it
when you're so busy.
How could I miss this?
Please count with me.
- One!
- One!
- Two!
- Two!
- Three!
- Three!
