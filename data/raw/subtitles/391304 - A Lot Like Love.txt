# Love burns brighter than sunshine
# Brighter than sunshine
# And it's brighter than sunshine
# I never saw it happening
# I'd given up and given in
# I just couldn't take the hurt again
# What a feeling
# But suddenly it seemed so right
# What a feeling in my soul
# Love burns brighter than sunshine
# Brighter than sunshine
# And it's brighter than the sun
# It's brighter than the sun
# It's brighter than the sun,
sunshine
# Give me your hand and you will see
# Your heart is keeping time with me
# Oh, what a feeling in my soul
# Love burns brighter than sunshine
# It's brighter than sunshine
# Got a feeling in my soul
# Love burns brighter than sunshine
# Brighter than sunshine
# I got a feeling in my soul
# Love burns brighter than sunshine
# It's brighter than sunshine
# And it's brighter than sunshine
# Maybe it's just me
# But you seem finally happy
# I don't think I've seen your face
just glow like a neon sign
# And maybe we should be
# 'Cause even all the nights alone
at least I'll make it another day
# But I can live without you
if it makes you smile
# Oh-oh-oh
# After all that went down
# But I can live without you
if it makes you smile
# And I can't wait to see you rise
# And I can't wait for you to shine
# But I can wait for you
if all you need is time
# But I can live without you
if it makes you smile
# And I can't wait to see you rise
# I can't wait to see you shine
# But I can wait for you
if all you need is time...
