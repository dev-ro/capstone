[girl] Summer break, huh...
I bought lots of Butamen.
What should I do starting tomorrow?
[metal clanking]
[man 1] I might get cursed.
[man 2] What? How come?
[man 1] Because I saw
the ghost of a child here.
Whoa, right when we're about
to demolish this?
- Oh, look!
- What?!
Now, what should I eat?
Huh?! Wait, was that a lie then?!
[man 1] I heard our manager saw it.
[man 2] Aww, but this is the first site
I'm assigned to...
[man 1] Lucky you.
Grandpa Yasuji...
[boy] About 60 years ago,
the Kamonomiya complexes were built.
Sometimes it's called the haunted
apartment complexes, but it's still home.
It was me and Natsume's precious home.
NATSUME: LET'S GO VISIT
GRANDPA YASUJI TOMORROW!
KOSUKE: SORRY
LET'S GO TO GRANDPA'S PLACE
NEXT TIME FOR SURE!
COME TO SOCCER CLUB

VOICE CALL
[groaning]
[grunting, yelling]
[woman] Kosuke!
Dinner time!
[yelling]
[rasping, sighing]
[woman] What are you doing?!
DRIFTING HOME
[teacher] Finish your homework early
if you want to enjoy the last
summer break of elementary school!
Just be careful not to get
into any accidents!
Let's see each other again
at the summer festival. Bye!
All rise! Attention! Bow! Goodbye!
[girl] Natsume, are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine! See you, bye-bye!
[girls] Bye-bye!
Kumagaya! Huh?!
[both grunting]
- [whimpering]
- [gasps]
- Reina, sorry!
- Reina! Are you okay!?
Reina, are you okay?
[gasps] Gosh, what are you doing?!
- Oww!
- I'm sorry.
Natsume, that!
- What?
- Didn't you make that in art class?
[Reina] What's this trash?
Reina! No problem. It's fine, it's fine!
I got business with Kumagaya, not you.
Kumagaya!
I'm going to Florida in two days,
but we have one extra seat.
Huh?
It's okay if I borrow Kumagaya, right?
You don't need to ask me.
Feel free to take that little kid.
It's Land in Florida! If you don't mind,
do you want to go togeth...
Natsume, I found you!
We're going to
the haunted apartments tomorrow!
Huh? Why?
Summer break's research project!
The details are secret!
Hey, you'll come too, right, Kosuke?!
Wait a second!
I'm talking to Kumagaya here!
What?!
We, Kamo Elementary School Soccer Club,
are all-in-one and one-in-all!
Huh?
All for one, and one for all?
- Shut up, you runt!
- [boy] You're a little runt yourself!
Huh!? You're the last person
I wanna hear that from!
- [Natsume] Those apartments...
- Oh.
...are dangerous because
they're tearing it down, so don't go!
[boy] What? But still!
- She's right, Taishi.
- [Taishi] We can still go!
[Reina] See?
Then hand over Kumagaya to...
[shouts] Jeez, you guys are so loud!
I ain't going to either!
[Natsume] Hold it, Kosuke!
See ya!
[Reina] Oh, Kumagaya!
- [teacher] No running in the hallways!
- [pupils] Yes, sir.
[grunts] Jeez, boys!
[chuckling]
What?
If Natsume would
just come back to the club...
Hmm.
We got a practice match next week
with Naka Elementary School!
You're our best players and brothers!
We're not brothers.
[Taishi] Oh, the haunted apartments!
There's a ghost there! Everyone says so!
[Kosuke] Hey, Taishi!
That used to be Kosuke
and Natsume's house before!
- Hey.
- [Taishi grunts]
You guys, don't you wanna play
Smash Bros. at my new house?
[both] Yeah.
[Kosuke] Then whoever gets there last
gets the cheap controller!
[Taishi] No! I want the pro controller!
I don't want the cheap one!
[door opens]
[door closes]
I'm home!
[woman] Ah, welcome home.
[Natsume] Aw...
It's not getting cleaned up at all!
Jeez.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to do DIY for you,
but I don't have energy
after working from home.
Why don't you start jogging?
Maybe.
By the way...
Hm?
Did that apartment get demolished already?
Huh? Who knows? I don't know.
Oh, really. But that's a little sad.
You did spend a lot of time there.
With Yasuko and with Grandpa Yasuji too.
I wanted to properly thank them.
- Here we go!
- [grunts]
Come on!
Clean the rest yourself.
At this rate, we're gonna have
takeout tonight.
Maybe I'll get Gusto's
sukiyaki rice bowl again.
[woman] Here,
take Grandpa's favorite sukiyaki.
Come on, get going!
What a pain.
[woman] Hey, how's Nacchan doing lately?
[Kosuke] I don't know.
[sighs]
You two were so inseparable before!
Satoko too. That's so like her.
As soon as she returns, she takes her away
without barely discussing it!
It's so glum without Nacchan around.
Since you're very cold.
- Thanks for the food.
- Oh, you're finished already?
You left them again!
Your shiitake mushrooms!
VOICE CALL VIDEO CALL
NATSUME
We're going to the haunted apartments
tomorrow for sure!
Seriously?! Don't tell me
the research project's about...
Now, what do you think it is?
You'll find out when we get there!
KOSUKE:
I'M NOT GOING
What's taking them so long?
[Taishi] Kosuke!
Hey! [chuckling]
[Kosuke] What are we doing?
Operation Ghost Trap!
Huh?!
He says we're gonna catch it and study it.
It's our research project!
Well, just humor him, Kosuke.
What the heck?
Let's go, you guys!
Yeah!
Use this? Just use smartphones.
How's your side?!
[man] Who's there?!
Wait. Hey, don't do this to me.
Please don't.
[gasping]
[whimpering]
Jeez, this is all his fault!
Give me a break.
[breathing heavily]
This way!
Taishi, you idiot! What are you doing?
- Whoa! Ow...
- You...
[floorboards creaking]
Nope, this place is sealed too.
What?!
[Yuzuru] We've come all the way
to Kosuke's old house now.
[Taishi] Hey, hey! Over here!
I'm betting on this one!
- [Kosuke] Let's go already, it's imposs...
- Whoa!
It's open! Awesome!
There's gotta be one in here!
[Kosuke sighs]
[Taishi] Ghostbusters!
[Yuzuru]
Are you going to exorcise them?
[Taishi] It won't open!
[Kosuke] Of course it's locked.
[Taishi] It opened!
What? Seriously!?
[Yuzuru] Hey, Taishi! Take off your shoes!
Wow!
- Oh, Kosuke...
- Awesome!
Taishi went on inside with his shoes on!
YASUJI, TOYOKO KUMAGAYA
[Taishi] Where are you?!
It's not like I'll live here again,
so it's okay.
[Taishi] You here? Dah!
[creaking]
Pardon our intrusion!
Where is it?! Come out!
Your house was
above this place, right Kosuke?
- Yeah.
- So, this place is your grandpa's house.
Hey, knock it off!
Ugh, let's go!
[Taishi] I know you're here!
[gasps]
What's wrong, Taishi?
[Yuzuru gasps]
A ghost.
Huh?
[Yuzuru] That's Natsume.
- Let's go home.
- What?
[yells] Natsume!
Shut up, you bastard!
But our match!
[Natsume] What?
Noppo?
[all] Noppo?
[gasps, grunts]
What are you guys doing here?
- [Yuzuru whimpers]
- That's what we'd like to ask!
I was just taking a little nap.
W-We can see that.
Besides...
But who's Noppo?
[Natsume] Taishi and Yuzuru too,
I'm sorry I can't go to soccer club.
[Taishi] So, you came to join us
as all-in-one too, Natsume?!
[Yuzuru] You mean "all for one."
[Natsume] No, it's because Noppo's
always upstairs.
Here we go!
See?
Whoa! You can go up?
How did you open the hatch?!
It was open.
[Taishi] Whoa! It must be fate!
[Natsume] Noppo, are you here?
Whoa! Awesome!
Whoa. It's pretty high up.
[Natsume] Taishi,
be careful not to fall off!
[Taishi] There's a tent!
Natsume, are you camping?!
[Natsume] Well, something like that.
[Taishi] Really!
[Natsume] Noppo's always here,
so I set one up here for him.
[Taishi] Awesome!
[Yuzuru] So, who's this Noppo?
[Natsume] Seems like he used
to live in this apartment before.
[Taishi] Can I go in the tent?
[Natsume] Sure!
- [Yuzuru] Is he in elementary school?
- [Natsume] Yeah, he's about this tall.
[Yuzuru] Ah, that's why he's called Noppo?
[Natsume] Exactly!
He won't tell me his real name and
it seems like he doesn't want to go home.
Maybe he's the ghost!
What are you saying? He's not.
So, where is this guy?
Huh?
[Kosuke sighing]
You're just saying stuff like that,
because you want to stay here.
I'm sure you were the one who opened
the lock on your own here too.
Uh...
[Natsume] Well, I couldn't
just ignore that boy.
Don't lie.
I'm not!
[Reina] Once you have a taste
of Land in the U.S., you can't go back.
The Japanese one's a bit you know?
I'm taking the first flight tomorrow,
so let me know now
if you want any souvenirs!
- Hey, look!
- Huh?
[Taishi] There's a tent!
- [Aoi] Aren't they from our class?
- [Moe] The haunted apartments.
[Reina] Playing in a place like that?
Boys are seriously Neanderthals.
They're all idiots.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, it's Kumagaya.
What? Where?!
Huh? I don't see him.
Where is he?
Reina!
"For women, the early bird gets the worm."
"Seize the opportunity
that comes your way!"
Huh?
That's what my sister said.
N-No, that's not it!
I'm just irritated
because he ignored me yesterday!
I'm gonna go complain to him.
What? You're going there?
Hey!
[Juri] Wait, Reina!
[Reina] I'm gonna find him right away!
Just how much do you love this apartment?
It's not like that!
[Yuzuru] Let's calm down a bit! Okay?
[Kosuke] You don't even come to the club.
You're not finished cleaning up?
Stop lying! It's been two months already!
[Natsume] It's not a lie! My mom's...
Hey! The little runt!
Shut up.
I got business with Kumagaya, not you.
Natsume?
It's their usual argument.
Kosuke's telling her not to enter
this place on her own.
She's causing trouble again!
[Kosuke] You're the one who's lying!
Well, we're in here too though.
[Kosuke] Try me.
You'll just lie again anyway.
Natsume! That's enough already!
It's none of your business.
You're troubling Kumagaya!
You shouldn't be in here!
Setting this thing here.
Don't touch it!
[Reina] What are you doing?!
Huh! You're playing with this old junk?
No! Give that back!
- [gasps]
- Whoa.
Wait, let go!
- I said give it back!
- [yelps]
Oww.
Reina!
Are you okay?
[sobs] I'm gonna tell
the teacher and my dad!
This... is Grandpa's, isn't it?
Hm.
[Natsume] This is...
[Kosuke] I was looking for this.
What are you doing
stealing people's stuff?
No.
I'm taking it back.
Wait.
Grandpa's dead already, but you're still
barging in on other people's business.
You make me sick!
[Natsume] Oh, I see.
That's how you're gonna treat me?
Huh? What?
We played together so often
and lived together for so long.
I can't believe you can say that!
You have nothing to do with my house!
[Natsume] You're stupid!
[both grunting]
Crap! Stop!
[Taishi] Natsume?!
[yelps, grunts]
[Kosuke] I said stop!
[panting]
[Kosuke] Hey!
[Reina] Wait!
- [Juri] Natsume!
- [Yuzuru] Natsume, that's dangerous!
- [Juri] Get down from there!
- [Natsume] Leave me alone!
Come down!
No! Don't come here!
[gasping]
[gasps]
[grunting]
[gasps]
Give me your other hand!
[Natsume gasps]
[cracking]
[Kosuke] Natsume! Natsume!
[gasps]
Natsume!
[Yuzuru] She's coming up!
[Juri] Natsume!
Natsume!
Natsume!
[panting]
[gasps, coughs]
Natsume, you okay?!
Natsume!
[Yuzuru] You okay?
[Natsume] Yeah, I'm fine.
[Yuzuru] Oh, thank goodness.
[Taishi] Oh. No way.
[bubbling]
Th-There's nothing there!
What? You mean we're floating?!
Salty!
[gasps] The town vanished in an instant!
[Yuzuru] You're kidding! Maybe we just got
washed away in that heavy rain.
[Taishi] Then we're the only ones
who survived?!
[Natsume] No way.
[Reina] Kumagaya!
There's a ship coming over!
- What?!
- Seriously?
[Taishi] This is bananas!
Is this some kind of drill?
They've come to our rescue!
[Taishi] Hurry!
- Oh! Don't push!
- Hurry up!
- Ow!
- Stupid!
- You're heavy!
- Ouch!
[panting]
[gasps]
Huh?! Whoa, that's close!
Hey!
- [Kosuke] Help us!
- [Taishi] What's that?! Wait!
- Wait!
- Wait up!
Don't ignore us! Hey!
It's leaving!
Hey, we're right here! Whoa!
Wait for us! Whoa!
[Yuzuru] Taishi!
[grunts] Aww...
There it goes.
[Reina shrieking]
NO SERVICE
- [Reina] No way!
- [Kosuke] Why?
[Taishi] This guy can't connect either!
This place looks like the ocean
no matter what.
Is this even Japan?
[Taishi] A drifting home!
- [Reina] What?
- [Yuzuru] How can that be?
[Reina] Hey, will you do something
about this?! Isn't this your fault?!
What?
[Reina] It's all because you were here
to start with!
[Natsume] But I don't know either.
[Reina] Don't lie to me!
Reina...
[Natsume] I was just... just...
Just what?!
[Natsume] Because Noppo was here...
Who's that? There's nobody here!
Such a liar!
I-I'm not lying!
Then show him to us!
Cut it out! There's stuff to do
besides argue right now.
Well, what do we do?
But Natsume, you were here all this time.
Don't you know something?
Uh. Umm...
Not really.
I don't know.
How suspicious!
Oh yeah.
There might be food
in the room downstairs! I'll go check.
How suspicious.
[door opens, creaks]
[door closes]
[tap squeaking]
Is it really my fault?
[door opens]
- [Taishi] Sayaendo chips!
- [Juri] Her art project's fixed.
[Reina] What was she doing here?
She said she was camping here.
Neanderthal.
- [Taishi] Think we can have this?
- Kumagaya?
- [Yuzuru] After we ask Natsume.
- Hey!
[Kosuke] Huh? Makes no sense.
[Reina] Hey, wanna drink some of this?
[Kosuke] What's with her?
- Someone's worried about you.
- [sighs]
You could at least be honest with me.
Don't run.
[gasps] Hey, I know!
This must be a prank!
So we shouldn't get serious about it!
- Huh?!
- A prank?
That can't be...
The ship we saw earlier
was probably monitoring us!
I see!
If that's what they want,
let's enjoy this as much as we can!
That's true!
Right, Kumagaya?!
There's no way that
that's what happened here!
We were probably involved in a disaster!
I swear we're gonna get home!
But Kumagaya, how?
Just... leave it to me!
[Reina] Kumagaya...
You said to leave it to you.
[Kosuke] SOS, radio, fireworks,
searching everywhere with binoculars,
all failed.
Worst-case scenario,
we'll have to make a raft and escape...
I don't want to do that! No way!
If we don't find an island with that,
that'll be the most dangerous.
That's true.
Ugh, I'm at my limit!
I'm sweaty and there's no shower!
I wanna go to the toilet.
Just go in the ocean.
Definitely not!
Jeez! What's she doing anyway?!
This is all her fault!
[Juri] Reina, calm down!
[Reina whining]
Whoa, it's so dark!
Kumagaya, where you going?
Room 101 since it was clean.
What about Natsume?
She'll be fine!
- Reina...
- [thudding]
S-Someone's there.
Oh, it's just her.
What were you doing? Jeez.
[gasping]
[whimpering, screaming]
- [Yuzuru screams]
- Wait.
- Reina, hurry!
- I-I know!
[panting]
[door slams]
[whimpers] Wait!
[panting]
[yells, gasps]
There really is a ghost!
This isn't a prank or anything!
He probably brought us here!
- [rattling]
- [boy] Open up.
H-He's gonna kill us!
[banging]
[panting] No! I don't wanna die!
[Yuzuru] Me neither!
[yelling]
Whoa! There's a light!
[panting, yelling]
What is this?!
It's an evil ritual! It's a trap!
[gasping]
[fire crackling]
[Taishi] There it is!
Whoa!
Natsume? What are you doing?
You guys are here already? Where's Noppo?
Wait for me. Kumagaya, help me.
[whimpering]
Wait.
[screaming]
This boy here is Noppo. He used to
live in this apartment long ago.
So he really does exist.
He might be bigger than Yuzuru.
You're actually in junior high, huh?
Which elementary? Junior high? Club?
Forget that! Where's the food?!
Besides, what is this?!
There was oil used in construction.
We'll need it at night, right?
I thought this was
an evil ritual at first.
- But it's pretty and very relaxing.
- [Reina sighs]
[Natsume] There's food too.
[Taishi] Ooh! Butamen party!
Lots of snacks too!
Drinks too.
Water party!
[Yuzuru] Cola too!
[Juri] You brought all of this?
But that won't be enough, so I was boiling
rain water with this stove Noppo made.
Eww, how dirty.
[Natsume] You can wash your body too.
What? A shower?! I can take one?
If you wash with sea water
and rinse with water last.
[Reina] Noppo and Natsume,
you're both incredible!
[Taishi] We're sleeping here tonight!
- [Yuzuru] Cola! Cola!
- [Reina] What? No way!
- [Natsume] Listen, everyone.
- What?
To be honest, I've been here before.
[all gasping]
[Yuzuru] Came here... on a ship?
[Natsume] No, in this apartment.
I was inside this apartment,
and I found myself at sea a couple times.
Why didn't you tell us?!
Sorry. I couldn't come out and say it.
But relax! Usually when I sleep
and wake up, I'm back home!
This is probably a dream!
[Taishi] What?!
- [Yuzuru] Seriously? But this is so real.
- [Reina] Stop saying stupid stuff!
[Natsume] Don't worry!
Even when I stayed here overnight,
no time had passed when I got home.
[Taishi] Really?
Then shouldn't we be okay?!
[Yuzuru] I can't believe this. But if
you say so, Natsume, I believe you!
[Reina] No way!
[Juri] Me too, Natsume!
[Reina] What?
[Yuzuru] It's a one-night camp!
[Taishi] When you hear it's a camp,
it's suddenly exciting!
This is why boys are...
Kosuke?
There's no way this is a dream.
Is your head in the clouds from
locking yourself up here for so long?
Kosuke, don't be stubborn.
Why don't you guys make up?
[Kosuke] That's not it!
We should be doing something
instead of saying
this is a dream or something stupid!
Like what?
I'll be on the lookout upstairs.
Help will come some day.
Escaping this place is priority, okay!
- [door slams]
- [sighs] Jeez.
[Taishi] There he goes.
I wanted to play cards.
Hey, where's the toilet?
[grunts] Hm.
Hm.
[Natsume] No way.
Is this real after all?
I had a dream
where I was eating McDonald's.
[music drowns speech]
BUTAMEN
[music drowns speech]
[Reina] This is the first time
I've felt hungry in a dream.
Reina?
How's this a dream?
We can't get back no matter
how long we wait.
Our smartphones won't connect.
I'm hungry and there's nothing to eat.
We're just waiting to die.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure... I'm sure we can get home soon.
I hate that fake smile of yours.
Reina!
[Juri] Natsume, wait!
[door opens]
[scoffs]
- [Noppo] Kosuke.
- Hm?
[Kosuke grunting]
Here. Though there isn't much.
O-Oh, it's just you.
- I'm not hungry, so I don't need...
- [stomach grumbling]
Hm.
Is that...
Yeah, I've been thinking of some ideas.
I'd like to hear your ideas, Kosuke.
Well, I can share a little.
Within these four days, there were
other buildings drifting like ours.
We don't know when we'll get back,
so we'll need food
if we're stuck here long.
If we can't even catch fish,
we gotta go fetch some food.
That's why, when they come near
next time, I'll jump over with this!
And this rope?
I connected the roof's cables.
The end of it was an antenna lying around.
I'm gonna hang onto it
and use it like a zipline.
Kosuke, that's amazing.
Not really.
It'd be scary to actually do it.
What?
Kosuke, come join us. Everyone's waiting.
[Kosuke] At this point? Why would I?
[Noppo] Natsume's holding on by herself.
[Kosuke] Natsume?
[Noppo] Natsume's worried.
She won't say it, but she's waiting
for you too, Kosuke. Natsume's...
Natsume this, Natsume that.
How do you know so much about her?
Even I can't understand her.
I know Natsume needs you, Kosuke.
Who are you to say that?!
H-Hey!
BUTAMEN
GREEN TEA
[rain pattering]
[thunder rumbling]
Huh?
[gasps]
Isn't that...?
Whoops!
[grunts]
Darn.
[grunting]
[yelling]
Y-Yes!
What?!
Kosuke.
[inhales, exhales deeply]
[gasps]
Here I go!
Whoa!
[yells]
[groans, gasps]
Ow!
[coughs, sighs]
[groans]
This is Narahara's pool after all.
- [banging]
- [gasps]
What was that?
[gasps, yells]
[squeaks]
[squeals]
[door creaks]
What are you doing?
Why are you...?
Y-You bastard!
You made a big noise on purpose!
Huh? What's that about?
What?
Anyway, you came to Narahara
to find food, right?
Yeah. Wait, why did you come along?!
I'd be too worried if you went alone.
I'll help, so come on! Quit peeking
in the changing room and hurry!
Hey, this is a boys' changing room, okay?!
Wait up!
I remember these photos. Maybe
the other rooms are left as they are too!
This way!
- How's your side?
- [Kosuke] Can't find any!
If there's like
emergency rations somewhere...
But how's this possible?
Narahara was definitely
torn down in third grade.
Leave that aside and hurry up!
I know!
But it's natural to be curious about it!
[stomach grumbling]
Jeez, at a time like this?
I can't help it!
[gasps]
Ha! You're hungry too!
That's it! I remembered something!
Weren't there vending machines upstairs?!
Oh yeah!
We gotta hurry!
Found it!
You serious?!
Whoa! Hey, wait! That's dangerous!
It's fine! See?
Kosuke, you come too!
That's dangerous!
- [gasps]
- [glass smashing]
[grunts]
Natsume!
[groans]
You okay?!
I'm... okay...
What do you mean you're okay?
Wait one second!
[Natsume groans]
I'm the one who said this was a dream...
but it hurts so much.
This has gotta be real!
That's why I told you, you idiot!
Idiot...
Here, it's done.
We lost time. We gotta hurry.
- [grunts]
- Kosuke.
Just wait right there!
Darn it.
[grunts]
Jeez, I should've just come alone then.
You always dash off on your own
in matches and get hurt!
[clanking]
Even if you score more points than me,
someone who gets hurt is useless, stupid!
[banging]
You!
Hey, don't move!
We were the two forwards
because we were together!
You're such a wimp
who can't shoot the ball on your own!
Shut up! Even without you,
I can do fine by myself!
Someone came all this way to help you
and that's all you can say?!
Be quiet!
This is nothing!
Just leave it to me!
This is why when you're alone...
I can do it!
- [both yelling]
- [banging]
See? This is where we need to cooperate,
you little brat!
How long you gonna act like my sister?!
I can do it!
You can do what?! You're a little brat,
so you can't understand how others feel!
Who's the little brat
who locked herself up in the apartment?!
You know I was worried about you too!
Mind your own business!
That's my line!
Just forget it...
[both] And let's do this!
[yelling]
- [panting]
- [Kosuke] It's no use. Darn it.
[Yuzuru] Kosuke!
[Taishi] Natsume!
[Taishi] Natsume!
- [Kosuke] Oh, those guys.
- [Taishi] Hurry up!
Hurry and come back!
You're drifting away!
[sighs]
[Natsume grunting]
[grunting]
Time's up! We won't be able to get back!
[Natsume] No!
Natsume!
[sobbing]
At this rate, everyone will...
Don't worry,
we'll do something about food later!
Okay?
Let's go back to the apartment together!
Kosuke, you don't have to tell me that.
I know!
Cut it out!
- Jeez, right when I'm trying to...
- [banging]
[gasping]
[Kosuke] Uh, is someone there?
- [Natsume] What?
- [shrieks]
EMERGENCY BAG
FOR FOOD
[both] Oh.
[all] Natsume! Kosuke!
You guys, use that to come back!
[both grunting]
[water splashing]
- Kumagaya, are you okay?
- Are you injured?
NARAHARA
SWIMMING CLUB
[Taishi] Wow, awesome!
- [Reina] What's all this?!
- [Taishi] That's a huge haul!
[Yuzuru] Looks tasty!
[all gasping]
[Taishi] Open them!
How did you guys get this?!
Well...
- Rice party!
- Ugh...
It's almost expired.
This one's expired,
but I'm sure it's still okay!
- [Reina] Little runt, you test it out.
- [Taishi] Say what?!
- [Yuzuru] Hey, wasn't that Narahara?
- Yeah.
Wasn't it gone by the time
we were in the fourth grade?
Did it get washed away too?
[gasps] Natsume, is your leg okay?!
It's bleeding.
Mmm, I just tripped a little,
but I'm fine! I'm fine!
I'm so glad. Natsume, you're so cool.
You have guts! Right, Reina?
What?! Don't ask me! Huh!
I bet Kumagaya did all the work!
No, I...
- [Natsume] It's thanks to Kosuke.
- Huh?
[Taishi] Oh, so then you two made up!
No, this isn't like making up or anything...
Kosuke.
Kumagaya!
Kumagaya, come over here.
Just forget about her.
- Reina!
- [gasps]
Natsume, you're okay too, right?
Kosuke, come over to this room.
Well, sure.
[Juri chuckling]
Oh yeah! Kosuke, we made a big discovery!
We just found it earlier!
Look, you can see it, right?
[Kosuke] You're right. You can see
the water towers! It's our town!
[Taishi] Right?!
- [Reina] Seriously?!
- [Yuzuru] Whoa.
We're getting home.
If we just keep going this way, for sure.
All right!
[Kosuke] Whoa! We're falling!
[Reina] Jeez, what is this?!
[Juri] I can't breathe!
[Reina] Doesn't Kumagaya kind of stink?
[Kosuke] What?
- [Taishi] The town didn't vanish.
- [Reina] I hope my parents aren't mad.
- [Juri] It'd be nice to reassure them.
- Oh.
- [gasps] K-Kosuke!
- Huh?
[sighs]
What?
Kosuke, here.
[Kosuke] You...
[Natsume] This was
from Grandpa Yasuji to you.
What?
Um, we were talking about
making your birthday present a surprise.
My birthday... You mean that day?
Yeah, you've always wanted this, right?
So you guys were planning this together.
It was supposed to become
a precious memory of yours,
but I got in between you two.
When I'm not even family.
I'm sorry.
[Kosuke] Don't apologize.
Huh?
[Kosuke] I'm... I'm more...
That time...
- [grunting]
- Kosuke?
No! I don't know! It's nothing!
Hey, wait!
This is where
you're supposed to accept it!
Hold it, Kosuke!
[music playing]
[singing in Japanese]

[singing in Japanese continues]
AT SEA FOR
NATSUME 11
KOSUKE 11
What? You two were always together,
but you aren't gonna sleep with Natsume?
That was when we were
in the lower grades!
[Reina] Kumagaya, where are you sleeping?
Still thinking.
[Reina] Then, you can sleep here...
[Kosuke] I'm gonna go pee.
Hey, close the door.
- [Noppo] What's wrong?
- Oh.
[Kosuke] I gotta pee!
[Noppo] I see.
[Yuzuru] I didn't think the day
we eat weeds would ever come.
How long are we gonna
continue these tiny meals?
Reina, better safe than sorry.
Huh?
You mean "better not play with fire"?
[Yuzuru] What the heck's that?
Don't they mean the same thing?
Noppo... What on earth are you?
What do you mean, Kosuke?
I saw your arm yesterday.
Something was growing.
Growing?
You said you lived here long ago,
but I've lived in this apartment too.
So I would've known if you were here.
Especially if you were this tall
with shorts like that.
Kosuke, don't comment
on other people's fashion.
I've always been in this apartment.
[Kosuke] Always?
Since this apartment was built.
Lots of people came here, had babies,
and this place
was always filled with children.
But gradually, everyone left.
And I've continued watch.
Wait, I don't understand
what you're saying!
How old are y... [screaming]
[yelling]
A-A-A human plant monster!
That's right, a ghost!
Noppo was this apartment's ghost!
You're kidding.
- [Juri] Reina!
- [Taishi] Eek! Don't kill us!
[Kosuke] You bastard!
You! I don't know
if you're a ghost or what,
but you know what's going on, right?!
Why are we here at sea?! Hey!
I... I only know about myself.
I'm sorry.
[Kosuke] You sure?
Maybe it was your fault...
Kosuke, Noppo really doesn't know.
It's not Noppo's fault.
Besides, he's one of us who we've been
living together with up until now.
He's one of us?
Are you seriously saying that?
Huh?
That's not normal. That's a monster!
Don't say it like that...
Besides, "living together"?
Is this like playing house to you?
I hope you haven't forgotten
it's your fault we got dragged here,
because you locked yourself
in this run-down apartment!
This is your fault.
Just because we might get home soon
doesn't mean I've forgiven you!
What do you mean "living together"?
- This is awful, a filthy place like thi...
- Reina!
Don't say things like that!
Huh?
Hm.
Does it hurt?
Mmm.
Actually, maybe I'm not scared.
Noppo's big...
but I think he's a good guy.
Jeez...
What the heck? Then what about me?
[Taishi] Yuzuru's a good guy too!
Hm.
I'm afraid of scary things,
but Noppo, you have gentle eyes.
Noppo isn't a bad guy.
Yeah, everyone's no different. Right?
- Yeah.
- [Yuzuru chuckling]
[Reina scoffs]
Kosuke.
You really don't know anything?
Sorry.
[sighs] No more secrets now, okay?
[Taishi] All right, let's eat!
- [Yuzuru] My rice ball!
- You can eat it! Three-second rule!
- [Natsume] Want me to cook it?
- [Reina] Neanderthal.
What are you looking at?
Let me see!
Oh! Bring it!
[nurse] No running in the hospital!
[Kosuke] We're sorry!
Today's your birthday, right?
Maybe Grandpa Yasuji
will get you something.
What's with that? You must be plotting
something with Grandpa.
It's a secret.
You were all freaked out before,
and now you're completely fine.
I know Grandpa Yasuji will be okay!
Kosuke, you were freaked out too!
Shut up!
I bet you're probably still freaked ou...
[Natsume] Hmm. Shut up.
YASUJI KUMAGAYA
You're still freaked out after all.
Hm.
Well, he's not your grandpa anyway,
so don't be so scared.
Uh...
That's true. He's your grandpa after all.
My...
H-Hey, Natsume?
[man] Kosuke!
Grandpa.
- Go apologize.
- Huh?
Hurry up! Go apologize!
[gasps]
[Kosuke panting]
Kosuke.
Natsume.
[Kosuke panting]
[laughing in the distance]
[Taishi] That can't be!
[Noppo] Do you have a precious memory
with that stuffed animal?
Huh?
Yeah.
When I was small,
Grandpa Yasuji bought it for me.
I really wanted it at the time,
but I was holding back.
I don't how he found out,
but he bought it for my birthday.
Grandpa Yasuji was always trying
to surprise me.
That's why this is my treasure.
Natsume, you really love Grandpa Yasuji.
[Natsume] Yeah.
He was like a father to me, I think.
[chuckles]
That's a little creepy
when he's someone else's grandpa, huh?
Hm.
I would've been at Land in Florida
with my dad and mom by now.
Reina, you really love
amusement parks, don't you?
You're saying I'm childish, huh?
Well, why not?
All my memories are from there.
It's probably the same.
Huh?
[Juri] For Natsume,
I think this is the precious place
where all her memories are.
You gotta be kidding. Not for us.
Um, I want to apologize to you, Reina.
Huh? What?
I'm all talk, you know?
I'm always just hiding behind you
who can take action brashly.
Brashly?
I'm sorry I said all those things.
I'll work harder.
Juri.
Let's promise to get home together.
And... I'll take you to Florida.
Okay!
Ugh, when are we getting home?!
Is that place really getting closer?
[Taishi] # I'm so hungry! I'm so hungry #
# A hundred Big Macs and ten nuggets
Happy Meals aren't enough #
[Yuzuru] It's gonna make us
even more hungry.
[Reina] Shut up, runt! You woke me up!
[Taishi] Kosuke, aren't we there yet?
Nah, it's cloudy and I can't see.
[Taishi] What?!
What's that?
Hey, you guys!
- [Taishi] We made it?!
- [Reina] What, really?!
[Yuzuru] That fast?!
- [Taishi] What? Where?
- That!
[Taishi] Huh? That's not the town!
[Reina] What? Jeez.
[Juri] What is it?
[Taishi] Is it McDonald's?!
[Yuzuru] It can't be... It looks old.
- A department store.
- [Kosuke] Huh?
Hey, what's wrong?
Kosuke, isn't that coming toward us?
It's like the same as when Narahara came.
Yeah.
- I'll try going to it.
- What?!
We're low on food too, right?
I'll do it right this time.
[Noppo] Me too.
I want to go too.
Me too.
[Kosuke] It's a rooftop amusement park.
[on radio] This is Taishi on the
apartment roof! You guys, hurry!
[Kosuke] Okay.
If something happens, call us.
There it is. We can't stay for long, okay?
Hey, Natsume!
Huh?
[Kosuke] What's wrong?
Did something happen?
[Natsume] No, I'm fine. Let's go!
Uh, o-okay.
[Natsume] I thought
we'd find something here, but...
[Kosuke] It's too run-down.
- How's that side?
- [Natsume] Nothing.
- This.
- Huh?
2016
BIG THANK YOU FESTIVAL!
[Kosuke] Six years ago?!
No way.
[panting]
[Natsume] Wait one second!
- [Kosuke] What's wrong?!
- [Natsume] Just wait.
[door opens]
[Kosuke] What? You mean again?
[Natsume] Is someone there?
[Kosuke] Hey! We gotta hurry!
[panting]
[grunts]
Hey, wait up! Huh?
[Natsume] This is...
[Kosuke] Huh? This is what?
Natsume!
Hey, where did you go?! Whoa!
Found you!
Hey, was someone here?
If not, let's hurry and go!
Huh?
What's going on?
You've been acting weird. Hey!
I... hated this place.
Huh?
TOY PARADISE
[Natsume] When I was little,
we came to buy a birthday present,
but my parents got in a fight here.
I ended up not getting anything.
I'd forgotten about it though.
I'm sorry. Let's go!
[Taishi on radio] Kosuke!
Answer if you can hear me!
What? What is it, Taishi?!
[static]
Finally, I can hear you!
Hey, hurry and run!
- [Kosuke] What?
- [yelling]
[banging]
[Kosuke on radio]
Taishi, what's going on here?!
[gasps] Kosuke, your side
is closing into us this time!
- [Juri] We're gonna crash!
- [Yuzuru] Anyhow, let's get inside!
This is bad!
Oh my gosh!
[whimpering]
[yells] We're gonna crash!
[grunts]
- [Reina screaming]
- [gasping]
[grunting, panting]
[screaming]
[Kosuke] This is bad!
There's water coming in!
Natsume, you okay?
Yeah.
- Noppo, how about you?
- I'm okay.
- Let's hurry and get out!
- Yeah.
[panting]
[sobbing]
[gasps]
What is this? Isn't that a kid?
[Kosuke] Oh, crap!
Natsume, there's no time, let's go!
Natsume!
[grunts]
- Whoa! This is a disaster!
- [Kosuke] Yuzuru!
Pull us over!
- Kosuke! All right!
- [Kosuke] Yuzuru!
- [Juri] I'll help too!
- O-Okay!
[shrieking]
[yells]
[grunting]
[Juri] Oh, Taishi!
There!
- [Yuzuru] Taishi?!
- Somebody help!
- Taishi!
- [Taishi] Help me!
I'll go!
- [Reina] Juri! Me too!
- [Yuzuru] Sorry, get Taishi please!
[panting]
- Ow...
- [Reina] Are you okay?!
Yeah, I'm fine!
[grunting]
[Juri] Taishi!
[gasps] Juri!
You'll be okay now!
- What were you doing?!
- Reina!
On my mark!
O-Okay!
[both] Ready, pull!
[grunting]
[panting]
Thank goodness.
Causing us trouble.
Juri, Reina, thank you, seriously!
Oh, hey. Ow!
[Juri] It's okay, let me.
Huh?
[groaning, grunting]
[grunting]
- [Yuzuru] Hey, Juri!
- Huh?
Juri! Juri!
- [Natsume] It's Juri!
- [Kosuke] What?!
[Taishi] Juri!
[Juri grunts]
[Taishi] Juri!
Yuzuru, we'll go help!
Pull us over that way!
O-Okay!
[grunting]
[metal clanking]
[Natsume] Juri, I'm coming right now!
[grunts]
- Juri, hold on!
- Juri!
- [groans]
- [Reina] Juri!
[both gasping]
[grunting]
- [metal clanking]
- [shrieks]
Natsume!
[gasps]
[Natsume groaning]
[grunting]
[gasping]
Kosuke! Natsume!
[gasps] Juri...
[grunting]
[gasps] Noppo!
[Reina sobbing]
[Reina] Wake up.
Juri.
- [Natsume] Ow!
- [Reina gasps]
Hey, what are you doing?!
I'm sorry!
- [gasps] Don't touch her!
- [groans]
[gasps]
You! It's all your fault
that this happened!
What?
What are you gonna do
if Juri dies this way!?
[Yuzuru] Wait, Reina!
If Natsume didn't save her,
Juri might've been washed away by n...
I don't care!
Juri... Juri is my best friend! But you...
I-I'm sorry.
I'm at my limit!
We probably can't even get back anymore!
We're all gonna die!
[Kosuke] Stop!
Reina... stop... please.
[sobs]
[door opens, creaks]
[creaks]
[Natsume] I brought food.
Is your foot okay?
It's because of me. I'm sorry.
[clanking]
Huh?
[gasps]
[gasps] I know it's you, Kosuke!
What are you doing? Go away!
Hey, wait!
I thought I'd come listen to your story.
Huh?! Don't touch people's
precious things without asking!
Gosh, you're so hopeless!
[chuckles]
You've always been like
a little brother since we were little.
If you were sulking,
Grandpa Yasuji bought you anything.
Hey.
- I could never be like you, Kosuke...
- Hey!
What?!
You...
sound kind of fake.
[Natsume] Huh? What?
[Kosuke] I know you were crying.
No, I wasn't.
Don't hold it in.
That's why I came to listen.
I... I'm...
actually a crybaby.
[sobbing]
You know, right?
Since my family was a disaster, so...
I was always crying.
[wailing]
[glass shattering]
[music drowns speech]
[Natsume] But...
No matter how much I cried,
nothing would change,
and everything broke apart.
That's why, I held myself back
from wanting anything at that time.
I thought it'd be easier that way.
But...
Once it was decided
that I would come to the apartment,
and Grandpa Yasuji accepted me,
I think I was actually really happy.
Because I even thought
that this felt more like a real family.
- Say, "cheese!"
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [Natsume] And plus...
- What was that for, Natsume?!
...I could talk about anything...
and it was okay to cry.
I never knew that would make me so happy.
But Grandpa Yasuji passed away already.
The apartment is gone,
and everything's broken apart again.
The more I thought about
how I hated goodbyes, I struggled more...
But even if I told my mom that,
there's nothing she can do.
That's why I had no choice
but to come here.
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to trouble you either, Kosuke.
It's my fault for moping around.
That's not true.
It's my fault for dragging everyone here,
and I'm just talking
about stuff like this. I'm awful.
What happened to Juri is my fault too.
[Kosuke] I'm more awful.
[Natsume] Why? Don't...
[Kosuke] No, I knew
that you were having trouble,
but I couldn't do anything!
Plus, I said those things... and hurt you.
[Natsume] That little guy,
when Grandpa Yasuji gave it to me,
I didn't actually like it.
[Kosuke] Huh?
[Natsume] Because it reminded me
of bad memories.
But when I used to play with you,
this little guy was always with us.
That's why it became my treasure.
It's thanks to you, Kosuke.
No, not only that.
Going to school together,
and playing soccer together...
All of it was fun.
Just that alone makes me glad
to have been with you, Kosuke.
Okay! End of story.
I'm fine now.
I'll take care of my own problems myself!
You could... depend more on others...
Thanks though.
Even though I talked a little too much.
Kosuke.
Let's get home together!
I... I'll...
Huh?!
- What is it?!
- [gasps]
Kosuke, look down!
What's this?!
What was that sound?
Whoa!
This is worse than the department store!
- Kosuke, the sky!
- Huh?
[Yuzuru] Isn't this...
[Taishi] The Milky Way?
Is this light...
[Yuzuru] Hey, Kosuke.
Enough time has passed.
Shouldn't we get to town soon?
[gasps]
Darn it, are we really gonna
be able to get back?
[Yuzuru] You guys! You guys! You guys!
- Wake up!
- What's wrong?!
D-Downstairs! There's water downstairs!
You're kidding!
[Yuzuru gasps]
When we crashed, it must have
created a hole. What do we do?
[Kosuke]
We might have to leave this place.
[all gasping] No...
- [Kosuke] Get everyone together!
- [Yuzuru] O-Okay!
[Kosuke] Noppo's missing?
At a time like this...
[gasps]
That guy... is he still hiding something?
[grunts]
There he is!
[Natsume] Noppo! I'm glad you're safe!
We need to hurry!
Noppo... Tell us everything you know.
This apartment is sinking.
It won't reach the town either.
We don't know what to do anymore.
Isn't there any other way?
Noppo...
[gasps]
[gasps]
[rumbling]
[Noppo] I... couldn't leave
Natsume all alone
in this apartment
where everybody had left.
And Kosuke too.
Huh?!
[Noppo] I've watched
over you two all this time.
I'm one with this apartment.
This is the only place I belong.
That's why I was always
with the both of you too.
That image of you two
laughing happily together.
I couldn't get that out of my mind.
Once you both left, I understood.
NO TRESPASSING
I think that I really liked
seeing the two of you smile.
That's why...
[grunts, gasps]
This ocean was probably a place
where only I was supposed to come.
I think... I was the one
who brought you all here.
Huh? What do you mean?
Brought us here?
You gotta be joking.
What are you gonna do about it?!
Reina... N-Noppo...
Shut... up!
[Kosuke] Reina!
Hey! Why did we have
to get dragged into this?
Hey! Give me an explanation!
Reina...
How can we get back?!
I'm sorry,
I don't know how to return either.
[sobs] Forgive us already.
I'll do anything... please.
[Juri] Reina!
[gasps] Juri!
Juri!
[sobbing]
Jeez, I thought that you died!
You're being overdramatic.
I'm fine, I was able to come up by myself.
Are you sure? Really sure?!
Sorry, Juri!
- Juri!
- Reina...
I'm so glad! Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- [Reina sobbing]
Don't cry, Reina.
We're going to Florida together, right?
Yeah... but now...
Don't worry.
If we're together, we can get home!
[sobbing]
- It's my fault, Juri!
- Not at all.
- I'm okay.
- Me too! I'm sorry, Juri!
- It's okay, don't worry about it, Natsume.
- I'm so glad, Juri!
Tell us please.
You really don't know how to get home?
I'm sorry.
You guys should hurry
and leave this place with a raft.
Don't worry about me anymore.
[thunder rumbling]
[grunting]
- I leave it to you.
- Okay.
- Let's get the next one.
- Yeah.
[door creaks]
Are they done?
Just a little more.
[thunderclap]
Natsume, are they done?
Oh, yeah.
Natsume?
Noppo will board the raft too, right?
When this is his fault?
We can't just leave him like this.
If the apartment sinks,
Noppo's going to die too!
[Reina] He's not human, right? No!
But...
Besides, what if we can't get back
because we're with him?
What?
[Reina] Because he's the one
who brought us here.
[Natsume] You don't know that yet.
[Reina] Just stop already.
Hey Kosuke,
Noppo has always been with us.
Not only now, he's always been
with us from long, long ago!
- Of course I can't just leave him.
- [Reina] You seriously...
If we can't return together,
I don't want to leave this place.
- [gasps]
- Hey, what are you...
Don't say that!
That doesn't mean
you have to die with him!
Stop with your moping already!
That's true.
I'm overthinking it again, aren't I?
Uh...
Wait a second! I-I understand
what Reina's saying too but...
But! Even if we could get home
by leaving Noppo here,
that's... that's not right!
That's too cruel.
[Reina] I'm not saying this
because I want to either!
Right, I think arguing is the worst thing
we could do right now.
It's not clear
that it's Noppo's fault either.
But...
I'll be by your side, Reina.
You guys, sorry.
There's no time to be thinking.
Let's all escape together.
[music drowns speech]
Hey, is that...
[Natsume groans]
Now everyone can get on, right?
Do we have enough time?
Don't worry, I'll get it done.
Natsume, about earlier... um...
No, I'm sorry.
- I won't say anything anymore.
- Natsume...
[snoring]
[gasps]
[gasps]
What? There's water!
- Everybody hurry!
- Noppo!
- The room's lopsided.
- What is this?!
The raft?!
- Just a little more!
- Our stuff?
There's still some left.
Let's hurry and finish it!
[Taishi] Kosuke!
The raft's good to go!
Okay, this is the last!
Hurry and come!
I'll be right there!
What?! Hey, you idiot!
You're still here?! Let's get going!
[Natsume] Grandpa Yasuji's room...
- [laughing]
- [indistinct chatter]
No, I'm okay.
Let's go, Kosuke!
Whoa!
[shrieking, gasping]
- Noppo!
- Noppo!
You can't die in a place like this!
[grunts]
[Yuzuru] Hurry!
[Kosuke] Hurry up!
Is everything ready?
We're good to go!
Come on, Noppo!
[Kosuke] Noppo, hurry and get on!
[Natsume] Noppo!
- Noppo!
- [gasps]
[grunts]
Noppo, why?!
I'll go with the apartment.
So, I'm sorry.
[sighs]
[Natsume] I... don't want...
[sobbing]
...anymore... goodbyes!
[Kosuke] Wait!
Natsume!
Natsume! You idiot!
Come back, Natsume!
No! That's reckless!
Darn it!
- Kumagaya!
- Taishi!
- We're gonna row back!
- Yeah!
[Kosuke] Come back!
Natsume!
[Natsume] Noppo!
- [Noppo] Natsume, you shouldn't be here!
- Noppo, hurry!
- [Kosuke] Natsume!
- [gasps]
[gasps]
Natsume!
[grunts]
We're not moving back!
Kumagaya, come back!
[Yuzuru] Reina, the rope! I'll go!
[Kosuke] You said we'd go home together.
Why did you go? You idiot!
[Yuzuru] Kosuke!
- Pull us!
- Natsume's...
No! We gotta go back!
Natsume!
Noppo, don't worry!
We can still make it somehow!
[gasps]
Noppo?!
No... You can't be doing this too!
You can just forget about me!
No, I can't!
I can't just leave you here!
There's probably still a way!
Besides, we'll probably
get through this storm!
I'm sure we can get home together!
- [explosion]
- [gasps]
[Natsume shrieking]
[Kosuke] Go back.
[Yuzuru] It's no use.
[Taishi] This is impossible!
[panting]
[Kosuke] Darn it.
Darn it!
[panting]
Natsume...
What do I... What do I do?
[gasps] It's glowing!
What is this?
[all gasping]
We're moving!
What's going on?
[Juri] Isn't this going back
toward the way we came from?
[Reina] What?!
[gasps]
Huh.
Huh?
[Yuzuru] Mom... everybody...
We can get home, right?
[sniffles]
Yeah.
Taishi, we're...
Yeah.
[gasps]
Uh... huh?
Natsume...
[gasps]
Even if we went home like this,
she won't be there.
[all] Huh?
[sobs]
[gasps]
[gasps] Natsume!
Come over here!
Natsume!
[gasps] Hey.
Wait! Why are you going that way?!
You said we'd get home together!
Natsume!
[gasps, sobs]
Natsume!
No!
Let go! Natsume!
[Reina] Kumagaya!
- Don't go!
- [Yuzuru] Kosuke!
[Kosuke] Natsume!
[sobbing]
[Kosuke] Natsume!
Natsume!
[water sloshing]
Huh?
[Taishi] A bunny?
I don't want this.
I can't go home like this.
I swear,
I'm gonna tell that idiot. I swear to...
[Yuzuru] What's that?!
[all gasping]
[Yuzuru] Isn't this...
YASHIMA
[whimpers]
[gasps]
[clanking]
[grunts]
[Noppo] I just... wanted you
to keep smiling, Natsume.
That's all.
B-But...
It turned into this.
We'll get through the storm soon,
so don't worry.
[gasps]
[gasps]
[shrieks]
[Natsume] If I didn't return...
I wonder what my mom would do.
I'm sure it'd be easier for my mom.
That's right.
I'm the reason
why... everyone broke apart.
Kosuke too.
Because of my selfish actions...
KAMONOMIYA HOSPITAL
...he couldn't say goodbye
to Grandpa Yasuji.
I've been forcing myself into
someone else's home all this time.
YASUJI KUMAGAYA
Because I...
It's better...
if I just disappear.
But...
But...
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
[sobbing]
[Yuzuru] Hey!
[Taishi] Natsume!
- [Juri] Natsume! Noppo!
- [gasps]
- [Kosuke] Natsume!
- [gasps]
[glass shattering]
- All right! It's connected, Kosuke!
- Nice pass!
[grunts]
Kosuke!
Here I go!
[grunts]
[grunting]
[grunts]
Why did you come?!
Move!
What are you gonna do?!
We're gonna have
the Ferris wheel pull this wire!
[grunting]
Good! It's connected!
- [Yuzuru] He did it, Taishi!
- [Taishi] Kosuke!
Kumagaya!
- [waves crashing]
- [shrieks]
[Juri] Reina!
[grunts]
I'm sorry.
[girl] I remember you.
You always came with your father, right?
Huh?
Go!
[Natsume] You idiot! Why did you do this?!
I never told you to come save me! I...
I was fine!
You say, "I'm fine, I'm fine!"
How much more are you gonna lie?!
- It's not a lie!
- Just shut up!
[grunting]
Why did you come?
Everyone's gonna die now!
It's because you locked yourself in here!
[gasps]
I hate this old run-down
apartment after all!
It reminds me of how you hid
and cried while I pretended not to notice!
And it makes me wanna punch myself! And!
I said you had nothing to do with my
family, but you have lots to do with it!
You weren't barging in
on anyone's business!
This is really your house too!
But we gotta leave it behind now!
Or else, we won't be able
to go home together!
More than Noppo,
I want to stay together with you!
[Kosuke sobbing]
[wailing]
I'm sorry, Kosuke.
I want to stay with you too, Kosuke.
I wanna go home too!
But... But at this rate...
Don't worry! If we're together,
we can definitely get there!
Once I pass to you,
what do you need to do?
- Huh?
- There's only one thing.
Remember how much we practiced?
To shoot.
That's right!
That's the two forward's job!
Yeah.
Hey, Noppo.
You're gonna come home with us!
You got that?!
Yeah.
We're gonna get through this storm!
Here it comes!
Here it comes!
[clanking]
[grunting]
[both] Whoa!
It's pulling it up!
All right!
Kosuke, it worked!
See, we can do it if we try!
[Natsume and Kosuke] Whoa!
[clanking]
[banging]
[both] Whoa!
[gasping]
[clattering]
Whoa! It's super tangled!
[girl] This cable runs along the gondolas
and to the apartment.
If this line is severed,
we won't be able to save those children!
Everyone...
[Yuzuru] It's tied up!
[Taishi] This side too!
[Yuzuru] I'll tie one more!
Thank you! We'll put this last!
[grunts, gasps]
[clanking, creaking]
[gasping]
- [Yuzuru] It stopped.
- We did it!
[grunting]
- I'll help! Don't worry!
- It's dangerous!
[yelling]
[grunting]
[grunting]
What happened?!
[grunting]
- This thing!
- Y-You!
We're definitely all going home together!
I'm gonna feed everyone
my mom's croquette when we get back!
[Taishi] Me too! Me too!
I wanna play Smash Bros. with everybody!
Me too! I'm going to Florida
with Kumagaya!
[Juri] With me too, right?!
Juri!
Let's all save them together!
All of you...
[Yuzuru] Let's go!
Kamo Elementary School, fight!
[all yelling]
[clicking]
[snapping]
[yelling]
[chain chinking]
[Kosuke] Oh no! We're getting separated!
No!
That's dangerous!
If I let go, Kumagaya will...
Reina!
[smashing]
[creaking]
[gasps] Are you okay?!
Don't worry about me.
- [all gasping]
- Oh no!
[Taishi] It's starting to spin!
[grunting, panting]
Don't go!
Don't spin!
Darn it!
- [grunts]
- Taishi!
[clanking]
[all gasping]
- [banging]
- [shrieking]
[panting, gasping]
[clanking]
[gasps]
[clanking]
[whimpering]
[crashing]
[all sighing]
[Kosuke] Oh!
[grunting]
[Natsume] No way...
[Kosuke gasping]
[all shrieking]
[thunderclap]
[grunts]
- [gasps]
- [grunts]
- I'm pulling you up!
- [grunts]
[gasps]
Natsume!
Kosuke!
Just wait! I'll...
- [shrieks]
- Darn it! Are you okay?!
I said I'm fine! This is nothing!
[shrieks]
[gasps]
[grunts]
You...
Get a good hold on Natsume!
Natsume, come on, your other hand!
Don't push yourself again
and leave on your own!
If I become the only forward and
you hate me for it, I'm not gonna care!
That would be impossible
just by yourself, Kosuke!
If you don't have my assists,
you can't even pass through!
- I dare you to say that again!
- Ow!
[grunting]
[thunderclap]
Whoa.
[all yelling]
[thunderclap]
We'll be fine, okay?!
Kosuke, I know you're freaked out too.
Huh? N-No I'm not, why you little...
[Natsume laughing]
Natsume... Kosuke...
[gasps]
[panting]
[whimpering]
[Natsume yelps]
[sighs]
[Noppo]
Because I held these two back,
it turned into this.
I don't care if we can't go back
to that time anymore.
I don't care what happens to me.
But these two, Natsume and Kosuke
are alive!
I want them to live
and keep smiling!
[Kosuke] Where are we?
[Natsume] The storm is gone.
[Kosuke] Did we survive?
[Noppo] Yeah.
[both gasping] Yes!
[all laughing]
[Kosuke] I'm so glad, seriously!
- [Natsume] You were trying to act cool.
- [Kosuke] I was so scared!
[Natsume] Kosuke, you wimp!
[Kosuke] Shut up!
[both laughing]
[Kosuke] It's an island.
So it wasn't our town.
- Yeah.
- [Yuzuru] Hey!
[Taishi] Hey!
- [Juri] Kosuke!
- [Reina] Kumagaya!
YASHIMA
Um...
What is it?
Yashima
was the first amusement park
that my dad took me to.
I've rode this Ferris wheel
many, many times too.
Yes.
I loved it.
Yes.
Reina.
Reina, we should go soon.
Oh. Yeah, but...
[girl] You were such a daddy's girl
and a crybaby, but you did very well.
Hm. Mm.
Yeah, I worked hard.
Now, you must go.
Yeah.
Thank you for spending lots of time here
and loving this place!
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you!
[Reina] Goodbye!
[music drowns speech]
[music drowns speech]
[both] Wow!
[Taishi] So pretty.
[Taishi] Huh? There's someone there!
[Yuzuru] What? You're right. Hey!
[Taishi]
They looked this way! Let's go down!
[Yuzuru] Yeah.
[Reina] Me too!
[panting]
[Noppo] Don't.
[Taishi] Huh?
Only I can go from here.
What? But everyone's getting off.
How come?
I understand now.
Me and those children are the same.
This is the place where we return.
If you come with us,
you won't be able to get back home.
That's why,
I can't go with you.
I'm sorry.
Natsume?
Then this is goodbye.
[Kosuke] You...
Huh?
Y-You're such a crybaby.
You're probably worried about
if we can get home. Don't worry, stupi...
Ugh, that's not it! Nor am I crying!
Just when I was working hard to...
There you go again! You're making me itch!
I haven't been able to bathe either!
That's right! You stink!
That's mean!
- So do you!
- Shut up!
[laughs]
[Natsume grunts]
Natsume should be okay now,
right, Kosuke?
Hey, not you too, Noppo...
What is it?
Isn't this glow from before?
Don't worry. These little guys
will take all of you back.
These little guys?
Hm.
[Natsume] Noppo!
- [gasps]
- Hey!
- [gasps]
- Noppo!
It's moving!
[Natsume] Noppo!
See ya, Noppo!
Take care of yourself!
Goodbye, Noppo!
[gasps]
I'll be okay!
I'll work together with Kosuke!
[gasps]
[all] Awesome!
Hey, where's the other two?
- Over there.
- Huh?
[Natsume]
So we're really going home now.
Huh...
Natsume?
Uh...
Ah.
It's pretty.
[both gasping]
- [girl 1] Natsume!
- [girl 2] This is your home.
[girl 1] Welcome.
[Yasuji] Kosuke, Natsume.
Grandpa Yasuji...
Grandpa...
[Yasuji] Here you go.
- [girl 1] Natsume!
- [girl 2] Kosuke!
Let's go home together, Kosuke.
[Kosuke] Okay, Natsume!
[Natsume] Bye-bye.
Natsume?
Natsume!
Where were you?! I was so worried!
Oh, thank goodness!
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?
Natsume?
Natsume?
Is it okay that I stay with you, Mom?
Of course! You're my precious daughter!
C-Can I be a baby in front of you?
Of course you can! I'm sorry...
You can be a baby as much as you want.
Then, Mom...
No more takeout.
Huh? What?
Let's make dinner together, Mom.
[sniffling]
Welcome home, Natsume.
[Kosuke] About 60 years ago,
the Kamonomiya complexes were built.
Sometimes it's called the haunted
apartment complexes, but it's still home.
It was me and Natsume's precious home.
SUMMER FESTIVAL
We spent so much time together,
but I said something awful to her.
And in the end, I couldn't apologize.
Even when Grandpa told me to...
Sorry.
Once we came back,
everything was back to how it was.
CHOCOLATE FLORIDA
We still can't explain
what actually happened that time.
It's all a blur.
Just like Natsume said,
I wonder if it was all a dream.
But... it can't be.
What happened at that apartment was real.
I'm able to talk to Natsume like I do now
because of everything that happened.
Grandpa.
Our house was an incredible house.
That's why, with Natsume...
[Kosuke] Thanks.
Huh?
Kosuke, are you saying that to me?
[both shrieking]
[Natsume grunts]
Oh, jeez! You scared me!
Are you two okay?!
[pop music playing]
[singing in Japanese]
