Come on over a minute.
I just had some ideas
that I'd been thinking about
for quite a while...
About modulation.
It seems to me
that there are...
http://worldmkv.com/
Different themes in life.
 And one of my main jobs,
it seems to me,
is to help
through the mass media,
for children...
To help children
through some of the difficult
modulations of life.
Because it's easy,
for instance, to go from c...
- ...to f.
But there are some modulations
that aren't so easy.
For instance,
to go from f to f-sharp,
you've got to weave
through all sorts of things.
And it seems to me,
if you've got somebody
to help you as you weave...
Maybe this is just
too philosophical.
Maybe I'm trying to...
To combine, uh, things that...
That can't be combined,
but it makes sense to me.
14 years ago, a television
program for children
made its inauspicious debut
on station wqed in Pittsburgh.
Its host, Fred Rogers,
an ordained minister
with an abiding interest
in children
and an equally abiding belief
that they deserve more
from television.
-Mr. Rogers?
-Yes.
Where do you live?
-I live in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. -Oh.
- Did you want to...
- Pardon me?
- They are gathered
 in this television studio
 with Fred Rogers,
 an adult who cares
 just about them.
 His reward is the love
 of millions of children.
I want to tell you something.
What would you like to tell me?
-I like you.
-I like you, my dear.
Thank you very much
for telling me that.
 We had a
 director that once said to me,
 "if you take
 all of the elements
 "that make good television
"and do the exact opposite,
you have
 mister Rogers' neighborhood."
 Low production values,
 simple set,
 unlikely star.
 Yet, it worked.
 Because he was saying
 something really important.
 Love is
 at the root of everything.
 All learning, all parenting,
 all relationships.
Love or the lack of it.
 And what we see and hear
 on the screen
 is part of who we become.
 He had a singular vision
 of kindness and love,
 but a question that I think of
 a lot, in terms of Fred,
 is whether his attempt
to influence America
succeeded or not.
 I was all set
 to go to the seminary
 to become a minister,
 but I went home my senior year
 for a vacation,
 and I saw this new thing
 called television.
 Tootsie roll!
 America's favorite candy...
 And I saw people
 throwing pies
 in each other's faces.
 And I thought, "this could be
 a wonderful tool.
Why is it being used this way?"
 And so I said to my parents,
"you know, I don't think
I'll go to seminary right away.
I think maybe I'll go
into television."
And they said, "wait,
but you've never even seen it."
 Station wqed
 is located in the heart
 of Pittsburgh.
 His father
told him about this new station
that was coming along here.
It was going to be called...
It was called
educational television.
 Nobody wanted
 to do a children's program.
And I said, "well, we need
a children's program."
 And I said,
 "well, I'll produce it
 "and play some music
 in the background.
 "We'll get some free films,
 and, Josie,
 you can introduce them."
And then we discovered
the awful fact
that when you got free film,
 it was often brittle,
 and it would break.
 And if you were
 on the air live,
 you had to do something.
 Somebody had given me
 this little tiger puppet.
 I pushed it through
 the clock and said,
"hi, Josie. It's 5:02,
and Columbus
discovered America in 1492,"
and then just went
right back in.
 And that's how
 the puppetry began.
 We never expected
 to use puppets.
You know that... so much of it
was the necessity being
the mother of that invention.
My friend,
Daniel striped tiger.
How do you do? How do you do?
 The interesting thing was--
dad remembered
being six and seven
and eight and nine years old.
 That inner child
 never really went away.
 I had every imaginable
 childhood disease,
 even Scarlet fever.
 Whenever I was, uh,
 quarantined,
 I would be in bed a lot.
 I would put up my knees,
 and they would be mountains
 covered with the sheet.
 And I'd have all these
 little figures moving around,
 and I'd... I'd make them talk.
 I had to make up
 a lot of my own fun.
Eh! Take that.
Eh, eh, eh!
What's the matter?
 Over time, Fred became
unsatisfied with
 the children's corner.
He thought that it was
 simple and slapstick.
 And he said he really wanted
 to concentrate
 on the seminary, so he wanted
 to stop for a while.
 His ordination was
 as an evangelist
 for television.
It was pretty way out there
for the presbyterian church.
 With television,
Fred wanted to focus
on the very young.
What do you think it is?
Lion!
A lion. Great.
 Back in the 1950s,
 there was a school of people
at the university of Pittsburgh
 looking at early childhood
 education.
What was it?
 They felt that physicians
 needed a training ground
 so that they had a sense
 of where human behavior
was coming from
from the very beginning.
 Dr. Benjamin Spock
 was part of it.
 Berry brazelton, the famous
pediatrician, was a part of it.
Erik Erikson, the extraordinary
psychologist, was a part of it.
And Fred's part of that group.
 He-he became part of the group
 as a student
 of Margaret mcfarland.
Margaret mcfarland:
Fred, I think,
to the child,
the television program
between you and the child
is a real relationship.
 For him to say,
 "the feelings of a young child
 are every bit as powerful
 as our adult feelings,"
he was radical.
I know everyone says that,
but he was radical.
I've always felt that...
That I didn't need
to put on a funny hat
or jump through the hoop
 to have a relationship
 with a child.
 I went to visit
 with a new nursery school.
I had never met
these children before.
And I walked in,
 and there was a long stare
 from most of them.
 And one little boy by the name
 of Thatcher spoke first.
 And all he said was,
"my doggy's ear came off
in the automatic washer."
And there was silence.
Just complete silence.
It was as if,
"this is your test, Mr. Rogers.
Are you still in touch
with childhood?"
And so I said,
"sometimes that happens
to toys, doesn't it?
"Their ears come off
or their legs come off,
"but that never happens to us.
"Our ears don't come off.
"Our noses don't come off.
Our arms don't come off."
And Thatcher's eyes
were getting bigger
and bigger and bigger,
and he said,
"and our legs don't come off?"
And I said, "no, they don't."
 And immediately,
 all of the other children
 started asking questions,
 and poignant questions.
It was just as if, you know,
"we shall now open the door.
"You have passed the test.
You may come in."
 And what he wanted to do
 was to take all of that
 that he learned
 in television work,
 add to that
 the sense of ministry
 and the child development
 background.
 It became 
mister Rogers' neighborhood.
 A neighborhood was a place
 where, at times
 that you felt worried,
 scared, unsafe,
would take care of you,
 would provide understanding,
 safety.
 That's what the neighborhood
 was for Fred.
 Television has the chance
of building a real community...
 ...out of an entire country.
 The neighborhood
 is not a fantasy place
 where all these
 different people got together
 and everything
 was happily ever after.
 When you have diverse people
 together
 with their different opinions,
you have conflict.
And that's what happens
in the neighborhood.
You have conflict,
real conflict.
Halt, trolley.
Give me your name, rank
and serial number.
 "King Friday xiii
"establishes border guard.
King against change."
 The parallels between what
 is happening in the real world
 and what is happening
 inside the neighborhood
 are uncanny and undeniable.
In 1968, the country is at war.
 He can go on fighting
 longer than we can.
Frightened, meow,
frightened, meow.
There's nothing
to be frightened about
until somebody
starts shooting, henrietta.
Meow, meow,
start shooting, meow!
 That was the first time
 he knew that he was
 producing something
 for a national audience.
 King Friday
 was really irritated
 that people
 were changing things.
 So his reaction
 as the authority
 was to build a wall.
Remember our battle cry, Edgar?
Down with the changers!
-'Cause we're on top.
-That's right.
I can't believe
what a broad area we covered.
Oh, dear.
-Edgar, Edgar,
wh-what do you think he means
by "any trouble"?
Fred didn't want you
ad-libbing,
putzing around with the words,
 because he was always trying
 to get a message across
 in every show.
I want there to be peace
in this neighborhood.
It's been a hard time
for everyone.
Well, I really do hope
that what you say will work.
Do you have the tags
on the bottom?
Yes, I... I put 'em on.
-Look, see if you like them.
-Good.
"Love," this one says.
And then we float them over
into the castle
 so that great uncle Friday
 will know
 that the whole neighborhood
 wants peace.
Paratroopers!
Fire the Cannon!
Hold it, king Friday.
-Well, what is it?
-They're not paratroopers.
They're...
They're messages of peace.
Look at this: "Tenderness."
Messages of peace?
"Peaceful co-existence."
-Wait.
-You see, that one was...
They're peaceful messages, sir.
Let us stop all fighting.
Stop all fighting now.
--Oh, superb! Superb!
Meow, wonderful, meow.
That was the first week.
That's how it got started.
 From the early days
 of mister Rogers' neighborhood
 until the end of that program,
 he came in the door
every day the same way.
Hi.
Hello.
And he changed to the sweater
 to give a sense
 that we are gonna have
 this relaxing time together.
Whoop.
Change the shoes.
Some food for the fish.
Picture picture on the wall,
would you kindly tell us all,
is Mr. mcfeely on his way here?
 My job was
 to be the prop person.
And then he said, "oh,
"i know you've done
some... some acting.
 "I'd like you
 to play the character
 of the delivery man."
I must go off, Mr. Rogers.
I have a lot of deliveries
today in the neighborhood.
So I became Mr. mcfeely
on the spot.
 The trolley left for its house
 into the neighborhood
 of make-believe.
Boomerang, toomerang,
soomerang!
 Anything could
 happen in make-believe.
Oh!
But make-believe was not real.
I mean, there was
a distinction.
 Fred never appeared
 in make-believe.
 Actors did. The puppets did.
 There's the clock
 where Daniel striped tiger
 lives.
 Next you see
 king Friday xiii's castle.
 King Friday xiii
 is one of the few remaining
 benevolent despots.
These characters are...
Were people in his life.
Queen Sara
 would obviously be my mom.
I'd just like to say
what a fine person
my husband is.
Why, Sara.
 None of us
 like to think of lady Elaine
as my aunt,
but we wonder about that.
In the beginning,
she was a witch.
I heard that.
Here's a squirt.
What can I say?
 In a beautiful tree
 lived x the owl
 and henrietta pussycat.
Meow, meow, beautiful day,
meow, meow, neighborhood.
 And then,
 at the end of every program,
 we came back to Fred's
 television house.
And to help children understand
 all of these experiences,
he put that into a song.
And children need to hear that.
I don't think
that anybody can grow
unless he really is accepted
exactly as he is.
 I think he was
 one of those people
 who would do their work
 seriously
 and they hope that someone
will pick up on the seriousness
 of what they're about.
 There were times
 when he thought,
 "will people ever understand
 that I'm not just a klutzy guy
"who's fumbling around
in a '50s living room with...
With weird curtains?"
 Wgbh in Boston decided to have
 something called
 a Mr. Rogers day.
There was just a woman
in... in gbh
who was in their PR department
who loved the program,
and I think
her colleagues said...
 You know, I think they thought
 it was really simple,
 kind of '50s, square.
And she said, "no, I really
want to bring him here,
and I want families to be able
to come and see him."
 And the line to get in
 was blocks and blocks long
 before they even
 opened the doors.
 And the word got around
 really quickly
 that there's something
 going on with this guy.
Mr. Rogers, Mr. Rogers.
I like you as you are.
 A little boy came up
to him and said, "Mr. Rogers,
how did you get out?"
 And so he talked
 to the little boy,
 explained what television
 was all about.
 And the little boy's just
taking it all in, going,
"mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm."
And he...
When Fred finished, he said...
The little boy said,
"how are you gonna
get back in?"
 There was a whole
spiritual dimension to his work
 in the television business
 to be inclusive.
 He did this without ever
 identifying himself
 as a minister.
 He didn't wear a collar.
 He wore a sweater.
And he preached in that context
in a way more effective
than anyone I've ever seen,
because it wasn't a sermon
like, uh, an oratorical thing.
It was a communication
right into their hearts.
 He was a life-long
 registered republican,
 and if you look at the values
 that Mr. Rogers represented,
 it's influenced by his faith.
His christianity was this kind
of wide open christianity
 that was accepting thinking
 from all other places
 while never departing
 from the Christian faith.
 Fred's theology was:
 Love your neighbor
 and love yourself.
 And he saw that communication
 as the most deeply
 spiritual thing
 that he could be doing.
 When I look at the camera,
 I think of one person.
 Not any specific person,
 but one person.
 It's very, very personal.
 The space between
 the television screen
 and whoever happens
 to be receiving it,
 I consider that
 very holy ground.
 A lot happens.
 A lot happens there.
For somebody
who was in television,
he was just...
He hated television.
Here, buddy. It's all yours.
Wow, look at this!
Hey! What about me?
 In this country, the child
 is appreciated
 for what he will be.
He will be
a great consumer someday.
 The quicker we can get them
 to go out and buy, the better.
 There's so much of that
 in this country.
Mr. Ellison, I think you
have felt strongly
about some aspects of this.
Public television
could make a contribution.
As the American people
becomes aware of itself,
it discovers itself.
We do not know
as much as we should know
about who we are, what we are
and how we differ.
 How will man use his miracles?
 The answer just begins
 with public television.
 We want most of all
to enrich man's spirit,
and that is the purpose
of this act.
And then Nixon
became president,
and he wanted
to cut the funding.
 The beginnings of pbs
 was gonna probably be
 dismantled by Richard Nixon,
 whose approach to media
 was to threaten stations
if they didn't behave
politically.
 Nixon had a problem
 with his budget.
 He had to find money
 for the Vietnam war.
 It wasn't a lot of money
 in today's terms,
but he wanted
to cut the budget.
 In the midst of all this,
 Fred Rogers gets
to go before congress,
argue for $20 million
of funding
to sort of solidify pbs,
 in front of John pastore,
who's a senator who had already
 sort of made
 his congressional bones
 by attacking television.
This is going to be
a thorough hearing.
This is going to be a hearing
not to reach for a headline,
but to reach for a result.
 There had been
 two days of hearings,
and he hasn't been
very impressed.
http://worldmkv.com/
 If you'd been watching
 those hearings
and you had to bet
on whether or not
pbs was going to keep going--
no.
http://worldmkv.com/
That educational television
should permanently
struggle for subsistence
is intolerable.
All right,
who's the next witness?
Senator pastore told the group,
"I've heard everybody read
your testimonies.
"I don't want anyone
to read anymore.
I'm tired of hearing
the reading."
 When I heard about that,
 I thought, "uh-oh, Fred."
 All right, Rogers,
 you've got the floor.
- May I use this?
- And I could hear
in his voice the... the nerves.
Senator pastore,
this is a philosophical
statement
and would take
about ten minutes to read.
So I'll not do that. Uh...
One of the first things
that a child learns
in a healthy family is trust.
And I trust what you have said,
that you will read this.
It's very important to me.
I care deeply about children.
My first children...
Will it make you happy
if you read it?
I'd just like to talk about it,
-if it's all right.
-All right, sir.
This is what I give.
I give an expression of care
every day to each child
to help him realize
that he is unique.
I end the program by saying,
"you've made this day
a special day
"by just your being you.
"There's no person
in the whole world like you.
And I like you
just the way you are."
And I feel that if we
in public television
can only make it clear
that feelings are mentionable
and manageable,
we will have done
a great service.
Uh, could I tell you the words
of one of the songs,
which I feel is very important?
Yes.
This has to do with
that good feeling of control,
which I feel that...
That children need to know
is there.
And it starts out, "what do you
do with the mad that you feel?"
And that first line came
straight from a child.
I work with children,
doing puppets in...
In very personal communication
with small groups.
"What do you do
with the mad that you feel
"when you feel so mad
you could bite?
"When the whole wide world
seems oh so wrong
"and nothing you do
seems very right?
"It's great to be able to stop
"when you've planned
a thing that's wrong
"and be able to do
something else instead
"and think this song.
"I can stop when I want to,
can stop when I wish,
"can stop, stop, stop anytime.
"Know that there's something
deep inside
that helps us become
what we can."
I think it's wonderful.
I think it's wonderful.
Looks like you just earned
the $20 million.
 Fred Rogers is
 easily the star of the show,
and if children had votes,
public television would be
on easy street tomorrow.
- Oh, wow.
Everything just
sort of exploded.
 You know,
 suddenly there was press
 beating a path to our door.
 Good evening.
 I was in Pittsburgh
a few days ago
 doing a bit
 of investigative reporting
 on a man named Fred Rogers.
Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Wonderful. Meow!
 Mr. Rogers
 does ten different voices
 for ten different puppets.
Well, a copperhead
is poisonous, is it not?
 He writes, he's the producer,
 he is the chief performer,
 and he is a marvel.
 Fred Rogers,
 as best I can tell,
 has managed to escape
 the calloused, the embittered,
 the negative aspects
 of being a public performer.
 He is doing the one thing
 in the world
that he wishes to do, and he is
by any definition a happy man.
 I sometimes wonder
 myself how he ticked.
It's a little tough
for me to have the...
Almost the second Christ
as my dad.
 If we were
 at the dinner table
 and he would want
 to say something
 that wasn't necessarily
Mr. Rogers-like,
he would say it in
lady Elaine fairchilde's voice.
Get out here, Friday.
I need to speak with you.
 That was our cue
 that this is the alter-ego
speaking now, you know,
and just letting off
a little steam.
 He and I both had childhoods
 that you weren't allowed
 to be angry.
You weren't allowed
to show your anger.
 And we were never able
 to do it.
 It scared us.
 Music was my first language.
 I was scared to use words.
 I didn't want to be a bad boy.
 I didn't want to tell people
 that I was angry.
 But I could show it through...
 The way I would play
 on the piano.
 I could literally laugh or cry
 or be very angry
through the ends of my fingers.
I've always felt that you were
someone who could understand
the deep feelings
or thoughts of people.
Well, it took me so long
to get tame.
I try to understand
how everybody else
is working at it.
Sometimes it isn't easy.
No, but it's worth a try.
Daniel was pretty much Fred.
He did all the voices,
but, uh...
But I think Daniel
was the real Fred.
Maybe I could talk about clocks
and loving...
And things like that.
A, b, c, d,
f, g, j, k,
l, m, s...
Oh, lady aberlin, I just
can't go to school tomorrow.
Why not, Daniel?
Because I don't know
everything.
 Daniel is articulating
the fears and anxieties
and feelings
that Fred had as a child,
but that many children have.
 He never forgot how
 vulnerable it was to be a kid.
 You know,
 you're this little thing.
Everything else in the world
is bigger than you are,
and you have to learn
everything
that helps you
get through in life.
 I think that it just
 never left him.
 Whatever those scars
 of his life were,
 he wanted to help heal
 that wound, maybe?
It's a lot easier,
even as an adult,
for me to have Daniel say...
"I'm really scared.
Do you think maybe
you could give me a hug?"
You know?
That would be hard for me
to say, "I'm really scared.
Do you think
you could give me a hug?"
So the difference from the...
From here to here,
that doesn't seem
very far, but...
It was efficacious,
to say the least.
A car ran over
the jaw of your cat?
-Mm-hmm.
-And what happened?
It was bleeding.
Oh.
They tried and fixed it,
but they fixed it
for a half a day,
but then it died.
-But then it died?
-Mm-hmm.
Oh, I think that's scary.
 All you had to do
 was see Fred
 inhabit Daniel to...
Really kind of figure it out.
I mean, they were symbiotic.
 As strange as it is
 to see a grown man
 have a symbiotic relationship
with kind of a dingy, you know,
worn-out little sock puppet,
he definitely had that.
Would you give me a hug?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
'Cause I needed that.
I better go back in the case,
Mr. Rogers.
Okay, Daniel.
He's really nice.
You could talk to him.
Okay, Daniel.
 Just a minute.
 I want to show you something.
Okay.
Wonder what.
It's a balloon.
Oh, a balloon.
Could you blow it up for me?
Surely.
 So, this is the first year
of mister Rogers' neighborhood.
 Daniel striped tiger
 is there with lady aberlin,
 asking her to blow
 a balloon up
and then let the air out.
 You wonder why this
 is in there.
Uh, they can't hear.
Can you hear on any of these?
 There's something
 I want to ask you.
What does "assassination" mean?
What happened? Do you know?
Somebody said he's been shot.
Let's roll some videotape
on this out here, friends.
 Ha-have you heard
 that word a lot today?
 Yes.
And I didn't know
what it meant.
Well...
It means...
Somebody getting killed...
 ...in a...
 A sort of surprise way.
That's what happened, you know.
That man killed that other man.
A lot of people are sad
and scared about it, you know.
I'd rather talk about it
some other day.
Whenever you like.
 I felt that I had to speak
 to the families of our country
 about grief.
 A plea not to leave
 the children isolated
 and at the mercy
 of their own fantasies
 of loss and destruction.
 Children have
 very deep feelings
 just the way parents do,
 just the way everybody does.
 And our striving
 to understand those feelings
and to better respond to them
is what I feel is a most
important task in our world.
 He realized
 that if he really wanted
to communicate,
the most important thing
is to listen.
'Cause there's so many people
who will just
lump 'em all together and say,
"hey, kids, come along.
We'll see the next cartoon."
And they couldn't
care less about
what that cartoon
is saying to the child
about such things
as human dignity.
 Remember what was happening
 for children's television.
 It was speeding up.
 Fred was pretty radical
 in television for that day
 in that he used time
totally differently.
 To Fred, silence
was his delight.
 Fred took
 an egg timer and said,
"do you want to know
how long a minute is?
Here. We're going to show you."
 And we just sat there
 for the whole minute.
 There's a lot of slow space.
There's no wasted space.
In.
Out.
 I think silence
 is one of the greatest gifts
 that we have.
 His questions are direct,
simple, short,
 and then he waits.
 He interviewed me,
 and he put his face
about three inches away
from my face,
 says, "it's so nice
to see you and to be with you."
 It scared the living daylights
 out of me.
 But I realized this is what
 children do with adults.
 And sometimes after
they answer,
he doesn't say anything else.
So they say a little bit more.
It's-it's a... it's a perfect
interviewing trick.
Very funny. Very funny.
Very funny.
I'm not falling for it.
Very good.
Handyman negri and
officer clemmons, I presume.
Correct as always,
your highness.
 Could we take a close look
at, uh, your badge here,
officer clemmons?
My friends, I think,
can read it.
P-o-l-i-c-e.
I have always felt
policemen to be
the most dangerous person
in the neighborhood.
 So, to have me playing
 a police officer,
 I was tremendously hesitant.
 But there was something
reluctant about Fred to let go.
 And I said, "Mr. Rogers,
"i would be very happy
to be on your program
as long as it doesn't
interfere with my singing."
 And he teased me.
He teased me about that
for 20 years.
He'd say, "officer clemmons,
 "are we interfering
 with your career?
 Are we interfering?"
 He was relentless.
 But he also told me, he said,
"that was the moment
i loved you."
He said, "because you were not
going to kiss my ass."
Those are Mr. Rogers' words.
Mm, that feels good.
Oh, there's officer clemmons.
Hi, officer clemmons.
Come in.
Hello, Mr. Rogers. How are you?
Come on.
Why don't you sit down?
Oh, sure. Just for a moment.
It's so warm, I was just, uh,
putting some water on my feet.
Oh, it sure is.
Would you like to join me?
That looks awfully enjoyable,
but I don't have
a towel or anything.
Oh, you share mine.
-Okay.
-Sure.
 Around the country,
 they didn't want black people
 to come and swim
 in their swimming pools.
And Fred said, "that is
absolutely ridiculous."
 Today,
 trouble under a noon sun.
 Negroes and white rabbis
 marched to a segregated hotel
 with these results.
 The manager, James Brock,
 told them to get off
 his private property,
 tossed, uh, cleaning chemicals
 inside the pool
 in an effort
 to get the negroes to leave.
My being on the program
was a statement for Fred.
Cool water on a hot day.
 I think that will is the great
unseen and unacknowledged
ingredient in Fred's story.
 The level of will
 that this guy brought
 to really almost
 all phases of his life,
 physical and spiritual...
 ...there's no better
 manifestation of that than...
143.
Is that your address here?
Oh, no.
It-it means something special.
 1-4-3?
 Mm-hmm. You see,
"i" is one letter,
and "love"-- l-o-v-e--
is four letters,
and "you"-- y-o-u--
is three letters.
 Fred would go to
 the Pittsburgh athletic club,
 and he swam a mile.
 He swam at a unhurried
 but deliberate
 and determined pace.
 And then he got on the scale,
and the needle of the scale
jumped to 143.
And he came off it
with kind of a little smile
on his face,
 and he told me that he
 had weighed 143 pounds
 every day of his life
 since, like,
 the late '50s or early '60s.
Now, I've thought
about this a lot.
What, that... that 143-pound
thing drives me insane.
Try that.
I can't do that.
 In Fred's private numerology,
 "i love you" is "1-4-3."
 So, when the needle
 jumps to 143,
 there's, like,
 this confirming quality.
There are so many weird things
that I'm not gonna tell you.
No.
 Freddy was like
 the little rich kid
 that lived in the big house.
 And we were all the...
 The goofball kids
 that lived across the alley.
 We could be ourselves
 around Fred.
 We were crazies.
 We all had long hair,
 and we were always
having fun,
we were always making jokes.
Those aren't mine.
Whose are these?
 If we ever
 saw a camera laying around,
 we'd grab it,
 I'd pull my pants down,
I'd take a picture of my ass
and put their camera back.
And, like, then it was film,
so, like, three weeks later,
you'd go to the fotomat,
and you'd get
your pictures back,
and there's aunt Judy,
and there's uncle Fred,
and there's some guy's ass,
you know.
 And one day, Fred brought
 his camera into the studio,
 and he was taking pictures
 with it.
And we went behind the set,
took a picture of my butt
and put his camera back.
He never said anything,
and, like, months later--
I think it was around
christmastime--
he said to somebody, "did you
give Nick his present?"
And it was a poster
of that picture
of me and my butt.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
-Did you make these yourself?
-Mm-hmm.
I... I, um...
I thought...
I-i thought of x the owl,
so I... so I, um...
I drew him in his house
and his little door.
Oh, these are real treasures.
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.
Would you like
to see x the owl?
You're a little happy.
That makes you
just a little bit happy, huh?
Oh, hello there.
Hello, everybody.
Hi.
I'm x the owl.
I hear you drew
a picture of me.
This is a book
 on all of the different tapes
 that we have.
Here are the tapes. Here.
 At that point, he thought
 he had done enough programs
that they could be repeated.
Those are all
different visits...
Television visits
that we have on tape.
He was writing, he was hosting,
 he was singing,
 he was composing.
And it took a lot out of him.
I think he wanted a breather.
Well, next week, we'll start
to show all of these visits
so everybody can see them
the whole way through.
Well, I'll look forward
to that.
Let's take a look at this one.
 When you think
 about all of those episodes,
there's only so many stories
you can tell, right?
What's in
the future for Fred Rogers?
I understand that you are
ceasing production this spring
of the neighborhood shows.
Well, it's going to give us
time to make some things
that I've wanted to do
for a long time.
-Hi, Katie.
-Hi, Fred.
And, John, wait till
you see this quilt.
 He wanted to do
 some prime-time stuff
for adults, and so he got
funding to do a show
called old friends...
 New friends.
 I wonder what it is
 that makes one person
 push on in the face
 of difficulty
 and makes someone else crumble
 in helplessness.
What does tomorrow feel like?
That big. I feel...
I feel that big.
There's no feeling
for tomorrow.
Feeling is dead for me in here.
 He was incredibly open.
He was scarily open.
 He wanted to speak to adults.
 He kind of put
 the puppets away.
But have you watched
some of these?
The feeling that...
This instrument is a place,
that it is a country,
that it's somewhere that you go
to say something.
What... what does this
have to do with our world?
I don't know any store
that's like this.
Any television program
that's like this.
A flower is like this.
A child is like this.
 Nobody but Fred
 would have thought
 of doing that for adults.
Take number 19.
Thank you for your poems
and your thoughts
about loving poetry and music.
You really inspired us
to make this program.
I'll be with you next time.
 But he wasn't making
the kind of connections
with adults on television
that he thought
he might be able to make.
 I remember opening the paper
 and reading about a child
jumping off a roof
with a towel around his neck
 because he was
 playing superman.
 And there had been a lot
 of stories like that.
 Some children died
 because of the injuries.
 I read it to Fred.
 It hit him, because he thought
 he had covered
 all that there was to say
 in child development,
but this was new.
Fred didn't become angry a lot,
 but he just became so angry
 about the fact
 that people would mislead
 a small child.
 And angry
 that it was his medium
that was doing this.
Yeah, superman.
I am tired of hearing people
who have long ago
set aside the concerns
of childhood,
 telling everybody
 what children really need.
I'll tell you
what children need.
They need adults
who will protect them
from the ever-ready molders
of their world.
 That was the moment Fred said,
"i wonder if we could do
a week on superheroes,
 talking about
 the pretend-ness of it."
 Very quickly,
 we came back with the show. 
Mm-hmm.
 Uh, careful, Ana.
-I don't want you to...
-I think I'm flying.
-I am! I'm flying!
-No, you're falling!
What is going on here?
Oh, Ana was trying to fly.
I was using my super-skirt,
and I was going
through the air.
Yes, but you were going down,
and you might have gotten hurt.
That's right, Ana.
You have to be really careful
with super-things.
 He was cool with every kid.
That's the whole thing.
I mean, there were little...
Kids that were...
They were little bastards.
They were just rowdy,
and Fred never said,
"this kid's a dick.
Get him out of here."
You know, I mean,
i sure would've.
 Fred used to say
that the outside world
of children's lives
has changed,
but their insides haven't.
 He realized that his work
 wasn't through.
I'm Fred Rogers,
and I'd like to talk
 with you about make-believe.
 When it goes to the next level
 is in the 1980s when he goes
to the theme weeks.
 I mean, to... to do
 a week on death...
"Oh, hi, kids.
 We're gonna
 do a week on death."
On divorce.
Some people
get married, and after a while,
they're so unhappy
with each other
that they don't want
to be married anymore.
On children getting lost.
Man, that's guts.
Help! Help, help!
Help, please, everybody!
 There's a piece of paper
 that I accidentally ran into.
 And he typed in this little
 sheet of paper
 about how he couldn't do it,
that he didn't think
he was up to the task.
 "Am I kidding myself
 "that I'm able to write
 a script again?
 "Am I really just
 whistling Dixie?
 "I wonder.
 "If I don't get down to it,
 I'll never really know.
 "Why don't I trust myself?
 "After all these years,
 "it's just as bad as ever.
 "The hour cometh, and now
 is when I've got to do it.
 "Get to it, Fred. Get to it.
 "But don't let anybody
 ever tell anybody else
 "that it was easy.
 It wasn't."
 The time that I was with him
 going on a New York City
 subway, all the children
in that crowded subway car
 began singing
 the neighborhood song.
 He might as well
 have been an animated figure
 stepped into real life.
Could I try that?
I brought my skates with me.
I can try.
Whoa.
-What else do you like to do?
-Moonwalk.
- Moonwalk?
- You got it. Yeah.
 People thought he was
 such an important
 American figure,
 they wanted him to speak out
on the issues of the day.
 And so Fred grew
 pretty comfortably
 into more of a public role.
You know, the earth is a name
for the place
where everybody lives.
And the moon
 is the name for the place
 where the astronauts go.
 Every time we went through
a national
or international tragedy,
 my impulse was always
 to call Fred
 and put him on the radio.
What shall we tell our children
 about the things
 that are in the news
 that seem so difficult,
 so tragic?
 Pilot Mike Smith,
 followed by christa mcauliffe,
 teacher in space.
 Christa has been rehearsing
 the lessons she'll teach
 from space.
Good morning.
This is christa mcauliffe,
live from the challenger.
 The lessons will be seen
 nationwide
 on public television.
Five, four, three...
 Two, one...
 And liftoff!
 Liftoff of the 25th
 space shuttle mission,
 and it has cleared the tower.
Challenger,
 go at throttle up.
 Roger. Go at throttle up.
God, no!
 How do we put it to children
 so they will understand?
 And part of Fred's answer
 was always to tell children
 that we, the parents,
 would take care of them.
Sometimes I found that
a difficult message myself
as the parent of a young child.
Sometimes I felt I was lying.
I knew that there were things
in this world
that I couldn't protect
my child from.
 Sometimes we need to struggle
 with a tragedy
 to feel the gravity of love.
Love is what keeps us
together and afloat.
 You know, it must
 be tough to be Fred Rogers...
...with your mission in mind
and then to have parodies.
 Eddie Murphy did that
mister Robinson's neighborhood,
 and I remember meeting him,
 and he just threw his arms
 around me
 the first time he saw me,
 and he said,
 "the real Mr. Rogers."
That's, uh,
Mr. Rogers there in the, uh...
-On the left.
-On the left, yeah.
Uh, now, how do you react
to that?
Well, some of them
aren't very funny.
But I think that, uh...
That a lot of them
are done with real kindness
-in their hearts.
-Mm-hmm.
I'm moving to a new
neighborhood
where I've made a...
A new friend.
Can you say "hooker"?
 There were some that...
Were not as kind
 in nature, and if they
 made fun of the philosophy,
 that was the only thing
that offended him, I think.
 The battle of the pbs stars.
 The crowd is literally buzzing
 with excitement
 as Mr. Rogers enters the ring.
 Oh, look out there, Fred!
 Fred had such
 a great sense of humor,
for the most part.
 There's child,
 obviously in shape
 -and ready for this fight. 
-Thank you.
 But what about Rogers?
 Experts have cast aspersions
 on his manhood itself.
 Fred would watch them
 with the rest of us,
 and everybody would be
 laughing, and I just wonder...
If a little bit
of fat Freddy came back.
 Just before
 getting to adolescence,
 he didn't have an easy time
 making friends, I don't think.
He got a good taste of what
bullying was all about.
 I've often wondered,
if there hadn't been
a fat Freddy,
would there have been
a Mr. Rogers?
 You can feel the momentum
actually swinging toward child.
 And what just happened there?
 He grabbed a puppet!
 Oh, look at this!
 He's hitting child
 with the lovable king Friday!
 And the French chef is down.
A laughter record.
Used to play one like this
when I was a young boy.
You see, I felt
that the adults around me
were pressuring me to be
what I couldn't be yet.
"Act like a grown-up,"
I'd hear them say.
Well, I was afraid they'd laugh
at me when I tried.
So I found a record like this,
and I could make
the laughs start
and make them stop
whenever I wanted to.
For someone who hated
to be laughed at,
it was a good feeling
to be in charge
of at least this laughter.
I think that those
who would try
to make you feel less
than who you are...
I think that's
the greatest evil.
 There was
 a wonderful quote from Fred.
Oh, that's hard.
 The most important learning--
it's the ability to accept
and expect mistakes
and deal with the
disappointment that they bring.
Hi, neighbor.
Had a little trouble
with my zipper there.
I'll get these shoes tied
and then...
Try the zipper again.
 And Fred also understood
 that there's a deeper level.
 You know something,
-lady aberlin?
-What, Daniel?
I've been wondering
about something myself.
Something about Mr. skunk?
Something about mistakes.
What is it?
I've been wondering
if I was a mistake.
 If you were a mistake?
And I will tell you,
sitting in the studio
listening to that, that day,
I said to myself,
"i can't believe Fred
had the courage
to put that into words."
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm too tame.
You do?
 Lady aberlin
 is saying to Daniel
what Fred himself
wanted to say,
not only to his childhood self,
but to all children.
"Okay, then Daniel's
going to say,
'oh, thank you.
That helped me a lot.'"
 and I thought to myself,
 "thank you, Fred,
 for reminding us
 that it's not so easy
 to quiet a doubt."
But make it a duet
so that it's not just
your fears,
but you'll hear my support.
I think you are just fine
exactly the way you are.
The way I look?
Yes.
The way I talk?
Well, yes.
The way I love?
Especially that.
 There were black kids
 watching the show.
 They needed a black figure
 who would not let them down.
 So, if I came out as gay
and there was some kind
of scandal,
that would not serve the race.
I carried that all the time.
- Really nice, François.
 I went to a gay bar
 downtown called the play pen.
Oh, god, did I have
a lot of fun.
But somebody, uh, told the
 mister Rogers' neighborhood
people about it,
and he asked me, "did you...
Were you downtown at that bar?"
And I said, "yes."
He said, "you can't go
back there anymore."
I wanted to show this film
to you.
Okay, on picture picture.
 Here's Mrs. clemmons at home.
 In '68, I got married.
I'm not stupid.
 There's the
portrait of the king and queen.
If I came out publicly,
he said,
"you cannot be
on the show anymore."
 The sponsors,
 Johnson & Johnson, and sears,
 they are not going to support
 an openly gay man.
 Fred was not prepared
 to lose that market.
 My marriage failed miserably.
And I discovered
you can't pray it away.
 Eventually,
 Fred came around to it.
 I think François
just came a little too soon,
maybe, you know?
Oh, yes. Oh, my, yes.
Heavens.
Um...
You gotta forgive me for this,
but I have to ask you something
that may sound impertinent,
and I don't mean for it to
for a second.
Are-are...
Are you square?
I mean, are you a straight guy?
I mean, you're just...
Are you really the way you are?
First of all, no, he's not gay.
I tell everyone who asks me,
"no, he's not gay."
But the, uh...
The other part is--
I spent enough time with him
that if he had the...
If there was a gay vibe,
i would've picked it up.
Nope, not as far as I know.
I mean, I think that anybody
who looked at Fred
looked at somebody
that they couldn't compare
with anybody else.
There's something inside you
that hasn't been lost.
Thank you, Daniel.
-Your childhood.
-Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I like him.
I know.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye. Okay.
 That was one of the things
 that I responded to.
That's terrific.
Wow.
I definitely saw another way
of... of being a man.
 I'm sure you've heard
 all these rumors
about Fred being a Navy seal
and killing people.
 Was Fred a Navy seal?
Did Fred have tattoos?
 And that, you know, he wore...
 He wore the sweater
to cover the tattoos.
 Fred was born a rich kid.
He didn't know how to use
a screwdriver,
let alone kill a bunch
of people.
 That, to me, is just, like,
 a classic example
 of people looking at Fred
 in all his eccentricity
 and singularity,
 and trying to basically say,
 "well, that can't be.
He has to be this way."
 The universal question
 about Fred is--
was he that way in real life?
And the answer is yes.
François clemmons, hi.
Welcome.
Thank you. How you doing?
-I'm fine. How are you today?
-Fine.
My feet were tired,
so I thought I'd just
soak them for a while
in this water.
-Does it make 'em feel better?
-It does.
-Would you like to try?
-Sure.
 On the show,
 he would say, "i love you
 just the way you are."
 One day, I said,
"Fred, were you talking to me?"
And he looked at me,
and he said,
"yes, I've been talking
to you for two years,
and you finally
heard me today."
And I just collapsed
into his arms.
I was... I started crying. I...
That's when I knew
that I loved him.
 No man had ever told me
 that he loved me like that.
 I needed to hear it
 all my life.
 My dad never told me.
 My step-father never told me.
So, from then on,
he became my surrogate father.
I'm so proud of you, François.
Oh, thank you, Fred.
-Thank you.
-May I help you here?
Thank you.
 The people who have had
a lot of struggle
in their lives,
 those are the people
 who really impress me.
There was an interview
with a little boy
by the name of Jeff erlanger.
We wrote because Jeff was
going to have a spinal fusion
and be in a...
What they call a halo, uh...
-Cast. A halo cast.
-Metal rim, and then cast
on his shoulders
and bolted all together and...
-All the way down his trunk.
-Yeah.
 We weren't sure... 
-Howard: He may not have
 survived the surgery,
 and so we said, you know,
"what would you like to do?
"Uh, this is going to be
a really big task for you,
"and so we want
to kick it off with something
that would be really special."
Mr. Rogers?
Hey, Jeff.
-I'm glad to see you.
-Hi.
Thank you very much
for coming by.
Can you tell my friends
what it is
that made you need
this wheelchair?
Sure.
Well, when I was about
seven months old,
I had, um...
I had a tumor,
and it broke the nerves
to tell my hands
and legs what to do.
I see.
And I got a wheelchair
when I was four years old.
-That was your first one?
-Mm-hmm.
-When you were four.
-Uh-huh.
 He told Jeff before
 they started that they would
have a chat and then sing
a song together.
I think he said,
"we might sing a song."
-I remember.
-Yeah.
'Cause, I mean,
i was sort of surprised.
"What? He's going
to start singing a song?"
Well, you know,
this is totally...
Not even what song.
-And it is you I like, Jeff.
-Thanks.
And there must be times
when you do feel blue.
Uh-huh.
I'm not feeling blue
right now, though.
- Me, neither.
I'm so glad
that you came today.
Thanks.
I remember asking one of the...
One of the staff people
that was there,
"well, you know,
what do you think?
Did it go okay?"
"Oh, this is good.
This is good."
 He had his surgery.
 He survived.
 Certainly, Mr. Rogers had
 an impact on who Jeff became.
His sense of self.
You obviously have a power now.
I mean, that you wouldn't
have had
when you first
started the show.
Well, it might sound
very ingenuous,
but I don't feel that.
 Behold.
 These shall be your minions.
 I would hope that anybody
who sets himself or herself out
 to produce mass programming
 for children...
...could have the kind
of respect
of childhood that I have.
 Because it's not all clowns
 and balloons.
What do you mean,
you don't agree with me?!
Some television programs
are loud and scary,
with people shooting
and hitting other people.
You know, you can do
something about that.
When you see scary television,
you can turn it off.
 We need to help our children
become more and more aware
that what is essential in life
is invisible to the eye.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
 As he got older, it was
 more important for him
 to be strong in his beliefs.
 Maybe that was how
 he was getting his anger out.
 His anger that people
didn't take him seriously.
They didn't get him.
They didn't get
the depth of the show.
 He started out being Daniel,
 soft and quiet and shy;
developed into king Friday.
That is not correct.
Now do it again
and do it perfectly.
 Wasn't king Friday
 a wonderful insight
 into his character?
 His determination
and his ambitions.
As a king, I must see
that the world runs smoothly.
Farewell to you both.
 That gruffness was his way
 of getting what he wanted
 across.
 Fred Rogers wanted something
 very badly
and would do what he felt
was necessary
in order to get it.
 Let's take the gauntlet
 and make goodness attractive
 in this so-called
 next millennium.
That's the real...
That's the real job
that we have.
I'm not talking about
pollyanna-ish kind of stuff.
I'm talking about
down-to-earth,
actual goodness.
People caring for each other
in a myriad of ways,
rather than people knocking
each other off all the time.
I mean, I don't find that
funny at all.
 What changes the world?
 The only thing that ever
 really changes the world
 is when somebody gets the idea
that love can abound
 and can be shared.
You're doing a great job.
 Dad never stood up and said,
 "look at what I've done.
 Look at this.
 Isn't this wonderful?"
 The only time I ever saw him
 come even close
to anything like that
was when he did the interview
with koko the gorilla.
Great.
That's a happy sound.
Is it?
That's a purr.
Like that?
Can you teach me
how to do that?
Isn't that a nice way
to welcome someone
and say that you're happy?
 It's... it was
 a weird kind of a...
 Kind of a thing, but, uh...
You realize there was something
kind of magical going on there.
What? Love?
"Love you," she said.
-Oh, is that...? Oh.
-"Love you. Visit. Love."
-Oh.
-Well, that was very nice.
Thank you, koko.
There's so much
to think about, isn't there?
 Let me ask you
 something about what we've
 -been discussing for the last
 three hours. -Woman: Yeah.
-Yeah. -Mr. Rogers
and the narcissistic society
that he gave birth to
 because he told every kid
 that they were important.
 Do you believe his philosophy
 destroyed a generation?
 This evil, evil man.
The criticism goes like this:
"You told everyone
they're special.
"They don't have to do anything
to earn that special.
"That's what's wrong
with our country.
That's what's wrong with
children today."
 He didn't say,
 "if you want to be special,
 you're gonna have
 to work hard."
 And now all these kids
 are growing up,
 and they're realizing,
 "hey, wait a minute.
 Mr. Rogers lied to me.
 I'm not special."
 I'm sure by then Fred
 had heard the criticisms,
 but he's not talking
 about entitlement.
 And if you don't believe
that everyone
has inherent value,
you might as well go against
 the fundamental notion
 of christianity
 that you are the beloved son
 or daughter of god.
-Hi, Mr. Rogers.
-Hi.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm glad to meet you.
Thank you.
I watched your show
as a youngster.
I wasn't allowed to go
to preschool
'cause I had a disability,
and my mom made me
watch your show every day.
So thank you.
Bless your heart,
and here you are.
Thank you for
my preschool education.
And thank you
for inspiring me today.
 At the very end of Fred's
 very last commencement speech,
 he said
what he meant when he'd say,
"you're special."
And what that ultimately means,
of course,
is that you don't ever
have to do
anything sensational
for people to love you.
 It is really a matter
of believing that
you're endowed
by your creator with good.
You know,
there are many different ways
of saying, "i love you."
In fact, I like
to think about times
when I've seen people
showing their love.
- Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Show 1765.
This is the last scene
of the last show
of the last day,
the last taping day
of the interior
of mister Rogers' neighborhood.
This place has been condemned.
Oh, it's been condemned.
Oh, well.
-You got two days to move out.
-Okay, thanks. See you.
That was wonderful.
 Years ago, it wasn't so weird
that... that somebody
as nice as Fred was around.
Now there-there isn't room
for a nice person on TV.
So, we must have, uh,
regular reunions.
Yeah.
How about Tuesday?
Yeah, I'll have forgotten by...
About everyone by Monday,
so Tuesday will...
-Tuesday will bring it
all back. -Bring it all back.
- We did it.
- We did it.
-Can you believe it?
-We did it!
Ooh, mercy.
 When he did stop
 making the programs,
 I felt that he was depressed.
 I mentioned it to him,
and he said,
"well, I miss my playmates."
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
That's fine.
Okay. Okay, slate out.
 We decided to have Fred back
 to do some promos about 9/11.
 He was very troubled,
 and I said,
 "Fred, what's wrong?"
 And he said,
"i just don't know what good
these are gonna do."
 And I just remember saying,
 "Fred, how can you say that?"
 When the horror of 9/11
 really hit him,
 i-i think it was
 a real eye-opener.
 He was realizing that...
 It was just so big.
 It's always going to be
 an ongoing struggle
 to overcome evil.
 I remember thinking, "okay,
"this is the time
that you need to pump him up
"because he doesn't understand
"this... this is really
important.
People listen to you."
Okay.
No matter what
our particular job,
especially in our world today,
we all are called
to be tikkun olam,
"repairers of creation."
Thank you for whatever you do,
wherever you are,
to bring joy and light
and hope and faith
and pardon and love
to your neighbor
and to yourself.
 Fred didn't like going
 to the doctor's office.
He had stomach problems
for a long time.
I mean, for several years.
Oh, what's that
right down there?
Take a look at the aquarium.
Do you see a dead fish?
A dead fish would be one
that isn't swimming
or breathing
or anything at all.
Look down there and see,
will you?
See if you see any.
Oh, yes, right there, isn't it?
 He told me that he was sick.
 I played a bach sarabande
 for him over the phone.
It's like sending
a little loving message.
 When he was very ill,
 he talked a lot
 about dying well.
To die with the hopes in...
With the hopes intact.
 Before he became comatose,
 he said,
"do you think I'm a sheep?"
And we knew what he
was talking about
because he had been reading
in the Bible
 about the last days,
 with the... with the judgment.
 It will be decided at the end
 who is a sheep
 and who is a goat.
 And I think the need was
 always there for being loved,
 for being capable
 of being loved.
There was a...
A little silence,
and then I said, "Fred,
if ever there was a sheep,
you're one."
Well, I suppose
it's an invitation,
"won't you be my neighbor?"
Uh, it's an invitation for...
Uh, somebody
to be close to you.
You know, I think everybody
longs to be loved
and longs to know
that he or she is lovable.
 And consequently, the greatest
 thing that we can do
 is to help somebody know
 that they're loved
 and capable of loving.
 Across the street
 from Fred's funeral,
 there's this hubbub,
 and there's all these people
 holding up signs saying,
 "god hates fags."
And I went and talked to them
because Fred would have it
no other way.
 I said,
 "are you condemning Fred?
 "Are you saying
 that he was gay?
Wh-what's... what's happening?"
 And they were saying that,
 "no, no, he just...
 He-he tolerated gays."
And so they were... they were
intolerant of the tolerance.
And the thing that... the thing
that struck me that day,
uh, more than anything else
was the children
that were there.
 Children that had been drafted
 into doing this work,
 into standing there
 with their parents
 and holding up signs
 and screaming.
And those kids
looked so unhappy.
Those kids looked so exhausted.
Those kids looked
so ill-treated.
It was just heart-breaking.
And I... and I knew
that if Fred had seen that,
that that's where his heart
would have gone.
I can't think how he would feel
 about the things
 that have come out
 that seem to set us back
 so far.
 And I wonder
 if he wouldn't simply
 put down his tiger
 and just stay home,
 forget about even trying.
 He's not a person
 who would have given up,
but this is daunting.
I... I think he would be
trying to mend...
Mend the...
...the split.
 He would be trying
 to find some way
 to find something positive.
 When I was a boy
 and I would hear
 about something scary,
 my mother would tell us,
 "always look for the people
 who are helping.
 You'll always find somebody
 who's trying to help."
I think there are
a lot of people
out there like Fred Rogers.
A lot more than we really
want to believe.
 In response to the question,
 "what would Fred Rogers do?"
 It's not a question
 that you can answer.
The most important question is:
"What are you going to do?"
From the time
you were very little,
you've had people who have
smiled you into smiling,
people who have talked you
into talking,
sung you into singing,
loved you into loving.
 When he was
 giving speeches, he would say,
"now, think about somebody
who's helped you along the way
 "for one minute.
 I'm going to time you."
 Let's just take some time
 to think of those
 extra special people.
Hmm.
Some of them may be right here.
 Some may be far away.
 Some may even be in heaven.
 No matter where they are,
 deep down,
 you know they've always wanted
 what was best for you.
 They've always cared about you
 beyond measure
 and have encouraged you
 to be true
 to the best within you.
Thank you.
My mother.
How I got to this point,
because it was
my grandfather's doing.
There was this woman
named viola
who used to take care of me
when I was little.
She was our babysitter.
I thought about Fred.
How about you?
Yeah.
Mm.
Thank you.
 Please welcome
 Jeffrey erlanger.
Oh, my.

Hi.
I am so glad to see you.
-Thank you. You, too.
-Oh!
What a surprise.
 You help to make each day
 a special day
 by just your being yourself.
 There's nobody else
 in the whole world
 who's exactly like you.
 And people can like you
 exactly as you are.

 You are special.
