Bunny rabbit.
How'd my hair come out ?
This is your half. and my address

You'll love

But people are looking

My name's HillayWhitney, and

Whatever she's having.
Certainly, Miss Whitney.

She died when

Oh.

i_ Sa_ Fra_cisco ?
Sure, but how comeyou want me
to write toyou so much ?
Areyou crazy ? Youjust happen

Hillay,

Aunt Vesta.
l got lost and she showed me
the way back after her
''Gloy of Love'' number.
Her ''Gloy of Love'' number ?
Your father and l have been
Iooking foryou for hours.
We werejust about
to call the police.
Uh, listen, maybe we shouldjust
forget about the sodas, you know ?
lfl don't go back, Leona will
start foaming at the mouth.
Oh, my. Come, Hillay.
Come on.
- Whatever they had, charge it
to the room.
- They didn't have anything, ma'am.
Look, l'm sory l got to go.
That's myAunt Vesta.
l'm glad she's not
myAunt Vesta.
Here, little girl.
Now, go home.
What's this for ?
lt will keepyou
honest.
Be sure to keep
in touch, CC. Okay ?
Well, sure.
We're friends, aren't we ?
You shouldn't playwith that
strange little child.
-Well, who am l going to playwith ?
- Me.
You like to play bridge.
Ta-da !
Dear CC, we're spending
the summer at our beach house.
lt's vey peaceful here. l get
to ride horses and think a lot.
l miss you. It's fun to have
somebody to be sillywith.
Ride ?
All l ride is the subway.
Leona won't pay for me
to go toJuilliard...
so l have to keep taking
dancing and singing...
from MissJean Kayton,
the freaky, fat vaudeville star.
The studio's in the cellar, which
means you only graduate...
when you're tall enough
to hityour head on the ceiling.
P.S. l hate my hair.
Okay, then we have Hillay
Whitney on Little Clementine.
Stop daydreaming, Hillay.
Let's go.
Dear CC,
Sometimes l get sick ofwords...
like ''proper;' ''well-bred;'
''cultured.''
l go through life thinking
eveyone's watching me.
Are they ?
Well, things are pretty good
in the Bronx.
l hate school, and l like
taking singing lessons.
l got to sing at my father's
dy cleaning convention.
l was a hit.
Seeyou later, alligator.
Cecilia Carol Bloom.
Dear CC, l've decided
to study law...
and l'm convinced l'll have
some effect on the world...
rather than end up in a mindless
woman's club like myAunt Vesta.
l ended up
choosing Stanford...
because four generations ofWhitneys
went there, all men, ofcourse.
But, mainly, l have to confess,
because it's co-ed.
DearWASP Queen...
Leona gave me a great present
for my 21 st birthday.
She moved to Miami.
l'm on my own now, and
l've got a flat, a can ofmace
and a subscription to Variety.

Dear CC, l went
on my first protest march...
and my father
called me a radical.
He doesn't understand
the whole world's falling apart
while he's playing golf.
Sory my trip east
didn't work out, but Dadjust
wasn't feeling well enough.
Will l ever seeyou again ?
Call orwrite soon, will you ?
Love, Hillay.
l wasjust about
to commit suicide...
by taking an overdose
ofvitamin A...
when your letter arrived telling me
l'm a genius and don't lose heart.
l've decided to live, even though
l never get anywork...
l've got no agent, and l'm deeply
Ionely during this festive season.
Thankyou. Next, CC Bloom.

- Okay, okay.
- l'm sory, he's not in.
Good morning, A.C.L.U.
Yes, hold on a moment, please.
All right,
Mrs. Thomas, you canjust
ignore the eviction notices.
l found out that
your landlord's been served
with enough citations...
from the Health Department
to wallpaperyour house.
Guess who got the lead in
the Falcon Players' new musical ?
Certainly not
the hand-walking queer !
-This is it ! This is it !
- l know.
Doyou feel it ? l feel it !
Oh ! l'm so happy foryou !
Okay, stand by, smoke.
l am the captain
And this is my shrine
Lord ofthe manor
See what l teave behind
A river in flames
Citiesonfire
Yes, l'm a retic
trapped in the wire
H_drogenfuet
lt burns so ctean
Throbs in the veins
Of my betoved machine
She is mywife
Her mechanicat heart
Constantly serving
titt death do us part
Now our gtorious war
draws to a ctose
The _ettow winds btow
And l have to know
Oh, Industry
Whatever will become
of me
Oh, Industry
Whatever will become
of me
Of me
lndustry, charity, faith
Oh
lndustry, charity, faith
Oh
lndustry, charity, faith
Oh
Great !
Well, l didn't understand
one damn thing in that play.
- That was the worst.
- Oh, Frank.
How can you say that ?
- It was brilliance. Brilliance.
- Get out of here.
- Were we at the same play ?
- It was avant-garde at its best.
Mom, l'm showing you
how they make the smoke.
ln the office, where
he stashed the 1 5 cases
he bought this afternoon.
- They taught him how to do it
at Carnegie Tech.
- It's the strangest thing...
but l just can't shake the feeling
that l knowyou well.
l know, l feel the same way
aboutyou. Why is that ?
Well, that's obvious.
You must have met
in a former life.
l don't suppose it has anything
to do with the fact l talk about
the two ofyou incessantly.
- Okay, eveybody, this is it !
- They're here.
All right,
takeyour time.
- l got it.
- Hill, l can't stand it.
Listen, listen. ''_ohn Pierce gives us
a probing musical attack...
at automation, industy
and the dehumanization
ofthe American worker.''
''Earth Mother Bloom is a veritable
Hannah Arendt ofsong.''
-Who's that ? Is she a singer ?
- No. She's a, she--
No, a sociologist- philosopher-radical.
It's a positive review.
- Positive.
-_he Times. _he Times sa_s...
''CC Bloom's performance is both
promising and purposeful.''
l propose a toast
to a great writer...
and to a wonderful
company.
- Where's the music ?
- Yeah, let's party!
-To a long run.
-A real long run.
And to a great director,
John.
- A great--
- Okay, CC.
Will you take a picture
with my cousins here ?
Just get in there.
Good, good, good.
Okay, now smile.
More champagne, CC ?
- You've got to get me
out ofhere !
- Be quiet, lady. Be quiet.
- l'm not drunk!
-Yes,you are.
Come on, let's go.
- You'll get a cup ofcoffee,
sleep it off. feel better.
- Don't touch me !
- Shut up !
- Relax and calm down.
Now get in the house.
- l don't have to sleep anything off!
- Go ahead.
l'll tell you for the last time,
l wasn't the ringleader !
- Marge.
- Huh ?
Have a drink on me.
l was a big hit.
My God,
what happened toyou ?
l went for a swim...
in the Central Park boating pond
with my real friends.
Did you sleep
with him ?
Yes, l did.
What a snake.
So, did the two ofyou
fall in love ?
l don't know.
It was incredibly romantic.
We went to the Plaza.
We drank champagne.
l think he's the most attractive
man l've ever met in my life.
You and your
feminist principles.
l know howyou feel about him.
l feel sick about what l've done.
l showed a complete lack
ofcharacter.
Sexual attraction has nothing
to do with character...
unless-- unless you're
Eleanor Roosevelt.
You mean, you would have
done the same thing ?
Me ? Never.
l'd never do something
that heartless to a friend.
- l swear,
l'll never see him again.
- Oh, who areyou kidding ?
Besides
what's the diff_rence ?
The fact is, he doesn't
even know l'm alive.
Looks like he's crazy
aboutyou.
What are we gonna do ?
l don't know.
You want me to move out ?
What do l wantyou
to move out for ?
l'm used toyou.
Besides, ifit hadn't been you, it
would have been some other girl.
Will you still water my plants
while l'm gone ?
- Where areyou going ?
- l told you, San Francisco.
My father's sick.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
We're friends, aren't we ?
Hey, Hill,John says l'm
outgrowing the Falcon Players,
and l ought to move on.
What doyou think ?
Where am l gonna go ?
l'm soryyou had to let go
ofyourjob at the A.C.L.U.,
but, geez, don't give up.
Your fatherwill be better soon,
and you'll be back.
Dear Ceece, l miss you.
l miss shopping at Bergdorfs.
l miss our facials.
What can l say ?
l'm now the adult,
and my father's the child.
l'm also dating a young lawyer,
Michael Essex.
He's got good breeding and a good
personality and good body.
Hillay, you'll never believe it.
l got offered a Broadway revue.
lt's called ''Sizzle.''
It's in the worst possible taste.
lt's vulgar, it's gross, it's dirty,
and you know what ?
lt's gonna make me
a huge star.
-All right, what do l do ?
- Let me showyou
how to hold it.
Put three fingers down and
make a circle. Stick the cue
through the circle.
- Okay, all right.
-Just go for the ten. Here.
Make that--
- Ooh, l like this.
Look, it came back.
- Prettygood.
Okay, that's it. That's all you get.
Stop. Wait. Stop.
l like the sound.
It's a great little sound.
Click. Click, click.
So, you hear anything
about Hillay ?
Um, her father
took a turn for the worst...
and she has to stay in San Francisco
a little longer than she thought.
You play.
l'll just watch.
- You mean, play alone ?
- Yeah, you do that pretty good.
Dear Ceece,
l thought it over and l feel you
should be true to your talent...
and not be seduced
by the money of Broadway.
By the way,
how are my plants doing ?
l gotta tell you, girls,
you don't look that good.
l wish you'd cheer up.
She'll be back soon.
l miss her too.
Now, come on,John, what do
we need signers for ?
How many deafpeople
are gonna come see our show ?
Three. Three deafpeople
always come to see any show.
Will you get out ofmy office ?
l don't want to talk
about it anymore.
- CC ! CC, come on.
-What ?
- Hi, Bill. What's the matter ?
- Come, come in here. Come.
Where the heckwereyou
all dayyesterday ?
Shopping. Why ?
- Why ? l must have tried
to call you a billion times.
- No kidding ?
My machine must be broken.
l wonderwho else called.
What's the matter ?
What did you want ?
- l don't know.
- You don't know ?
l guess l missed you.
That's a nice thing to say.
- You want to have dinner tonight
again after the show ?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Like a real date ?
- Real.
- Semi-date.
- Whatever.
Okay.
Any news
about the funeral ?
The funeral.
Well--
The funeral was yesterday,
and she's gonna stay
a little while longer...
to settle the estate
with her father's lawyer.
That's all l know.
-Well, Hillay, l did it.
- Bye, Mr.--
l'm leaving the Falcon Players
next month...
to start that bawdy revue
l told you about,
the one called ''Sizzle.''
l knowyou don't approve,
but, hey, l'm gonna be rich.
l can't wait.
Suicide.
Dear CC, Well, l did it.
l'm Mrs. Michael Essex.
Michael wasn't
just my father's lawyer.
He was the son
my father never had.
And in his final days, it gave him
greatjoy to see us together.
The ceremonywas beautiful...
and ourwedding reception
small but lovely.
The only flaw
was your absence.
But l understand
the show must go on.
By the way, how'sJohn ?
Doyou see much ofhim
socially ?
Last night, when
we were making love...
did you say
you loved me ?
What ?
l thought l heard you say
you loved me.
Did you ?
Yes, l did.
ls that usual ?
What doyou mean ?
l mean, is it part
ofyour routine ?
Doyou say it
to eveybody ?
l don't have a routine, CC.
l haven't said it to anybody
in ten years.
ls that true ?
l'm a womanizer, CC.
l'm not a liar.
That's great...
'cause l have
the most wonderful idea.
For richer or poorer,
in sickness and in health,
till death doyou part.
CC andJohn,
by the powervested in me
by the state of New York...
l now pronounceyou
man and wife.
By the way,
you may kiss the bride.
Here's your tape.
l've got to get back
to my lunch.
- What did you do that for ?
- This is the happiest moment
ofmy life.
l don't everwantyou
to forget it.
Does that make any sense ?
Perfect.
l t makes perfect sense.
l know you by heart
That's CC Bloom's
biggest hit of 1 988.
Thousands ofCC's fans
were disappointed last night
when her concert was rained out.
lnsiders sayshe'd left earlier
for personal reasons,
but whatever the reason...
all money will be refunded
and the concert rescheduled
for a tater date.
Putt over, ptease.
- She's running ten minutes late.
- l waited a year for this play.
Hillay.
Hillay,
the curtain's going up.
Oh, sory, Michael.
And now we takeyou back
to 1 9th centuy Bavaria...
for a vey sad stoy about two
ofmy favorite subjects:
industrial theft
and bosoms !
Otto Titsling
inventor and Kraut
Had nothing
to get very worked up about
His inventions were failures
His future seemed bteak
He _ed to the opera
at teast twice a week
One night at the opera
He saw an Aida
Whose bust was so big
it woutd often impede her
Bug-eyed, he watched her
fatt into the pit
Done in by the weight
ofthose terribte tits
Oh, myGod
There she btows
Aerodynamicatty
this girt was a mess
Otto eyeballed the diva lying
comatose amongst the reeds
And he suddenly felt the _re
ofinspiration flood his sout
He ran back to his workshop where
he futzed and futzed and futzed
For Otto Titsling
had found his quest
To lift and mold
the femate breast
To point the small ones
to the sky
To keep the big ones
high and dry
Every night
he'd sweat and snort
Searching for
the right support
He tried some string
and paper ctips
Hey, he even tried
his own two tips
Well, he stitched and he slaved
and he staved and he stitched
Until _nally one night
in the wee hours ofmorning
Otto arose from his
workbench triumphant, _es
He had invented the world's
_rst over-the-shoulder
boutder-hotder
Hooray
Exhausted, but ecstatic
Otto ran out to the diva
Bearing the prototype
in his hot tittte hand
But little
did Otto know
At the moment
ofhis greatest triumph
lurking under the diva's bed
was none other
Than the veryworst
ofthe French patent thieves
Phittipe De Brassiere
And Phil was watching the
scene with a great deat ofinterest
later that night
white ourAida stept
lnto the wardrobe
Phittipe softty crept
He fumbled through knickers
and corsets gatore
Till he found Otto's tit sling
and he ran out the door
Crying,''Oh, myGod
Whatjoy,what btiss''
''l'm gonna make me
a mittion from this''
''Every woman in the world
witt want to buy one''
''l will have
att the goods''
''Manufactured in Taiwan''
Ooh !
The result
ofthis swindte
ls pointedty ctear
Doyou buy a Titsting
Or do you buy
a Brassiere
Hoo !
Listen, l've got a racquetball
court in the morning.
So we go in, say hello, a quick
dinner and back to the hotel
nice and early, right ?
- We already agreed on that.
- And let's be sure to tell her how
wonderful we thought the show was.
- You are going to be civil,
aren't you ?
- Ofcourse l'm going to be civil.
She's yourvey best friend
in the whole wide world, right ?
Ta-da ! l can't believe
it's reallyyou.
l'm so happy
to seeyou again.
Oh, Hillay, Hillay.
And you.
- This is Michael.
- Oh, hello, Michael.
- You were fabulous tonight.
- Oh, it's so exciting
to finally meetyou.
That Otto thing thatyou did--
l really enjoyed it.
Stay, stay,
Arthur. Stay.
Stay. Arthur, Arthur,
back to the bedroom.
Back ! You're
embarrassing me, you idiot !
Get back ! Go back,
you brain-damaged bag ofbones
or l'll haveyou gassed !
- This is quite an apartment.
- Oh, doyou like it ?
l'm so glad.
Naturally, ofcourse, we're paying
through the nose for it, but...
really l think it's worth
evey single penny.
We're leasing, but we have
an option to buy.
lt's so close
to the theater and the stores.
Rememberwhen we said we wouldn't
be caught dead above 1 4th Street ?
l couldn't bear that downtown
squalor one more second.
But enough about me.
Let's talk aboutyou.
What doyou think ofme ?
No, tell me the truth.
What did you think ofthe show ?
Areyou kidding ? We loved it.
Especially that Otto--
Stay, stay !
Stay, stay, stay.
Good boy.
Stay.
-John.
- Oh, my God. Hillay.
l haven't seen you since
the night that play opened.
Yeah, it's been
a long time.
John. John. Come, you haven't met
Michael Essex, Hillay's husband.
This is my husband,
John Pierce.
So, Hillay, what doyou
think ofthe place, huh ?
Not exactly the old dump
on Avenue ''A;' huh ?
No, it's not.
It's all so new.
Yeah. New.
No, l don't miss
practicing law at all.
But it meant
so much toyou.
lt's a little difficult having
two lawyers in the same household.
Somebody's got to do
the entertaining.
Hillay, really, truly,
you were devoted.
l thoughtyou were.
The poor man's friend,
you know ?
Yeah, l'm still
the poor man's friend.
- Taxi !
- l guess you are. John.
There are lots ofways
to be the poor man's friend.
- Let the doorman do that.
-John, tell me what
you've been doing with yourself.
Oh, living the high life
with hi-ho here.
- He looks good, doesn't he ?
- Yeah.
The theater's mounted a lot ofnew,
successful productions this year.
- We're vey lucky. l bet.
- l bought thejacket.
Yeah. Ifl was in the theater,
l'd want to bejust likeyou.
l would. You have
an integrity that seems
Iacking in so many others.
So what doyou do all day
now thatyou're a housewife ?
l mean, don'tyou get bored
sitting around all day ?
No, because l don't sit around
the house all day. l'm extremely busy.
- Doing what ?
- l beg your pardon ?
How doyou keep busy ?
Doing what ?
What is this, CC,
the Spanish Inquisition ?
We haven't seen each other
for a while. l just want
to know how she spends her time.
- Is that a crime ?
-l don't know.
Is that a crime, Michael ?
l don't know. You're the lawyer.
Is that a crime ?
l spend my time working
on various charities.
l'm on the board oftheJunior
League, the Stately Homes
Preservation Society.
- l'm a docent at the art museum.
- She's a docent. She docents.
Excuse me. There's someone
bigger than you here tonight.
- You've got
your horticulture classes.
- Horticulture classes.
You may not be aware ofit,
but gardening's an art.
Hey, who's criticizing ?
Just soyou're happy.
l am.
l'm vey, vey happy.
- Miss Bloom ! Good to seeyou.
- Hi.
- Mr. Pierce. How areyou ?
- How areyou, Nicky ?
-Just a second. l have
your favorite table ready.
- Great.
Vey happy.
- This is the toast
of Broadway: CC Bloom.
- Hi. Nice to seeyou.
- Who's winning ?
- l am.
By quite a bit.
l'm home !
- In here.
- Arthur, get down. Get down !
You're still playing cards ?
You were playing cards
when l left this morning.
- So ?
-You want to stop maybe
and have a late lunch ?
- No, l don't. Doyou, Hillay ?
- No, thanks.
Arthur !
- This is a great color
on me, isn't it ?
- l guess.
-Well, is it or isn't it ? Be specific.
- No, it isn't.
lt makes you look like a corpse.
Is that specific enough foryou ?
May l have a tissue, please ?
Thankyou.
- Hill, l have a great idea.
Let's get a facial.
- Oh, l can't.
Michael's conference ends
in an hour, and then we have
to leave for the airport.
- l wish l could.
- Maybe next time.
Oh, Hill, look.
Isn't this divine ?
lt's so sweet.
l can't wait
to have a baby.
l know whatyou mean.
-You do ?
- Ofcourse l do.
- Whywouldn't l ?
- l don't know.
l just thought someone likeyou
wouldn't care about children.
You're so obsessed
with your career and all.
l'm not obsessed.
Just because l work
doesn't mean ''someone like me''
doesn't want to have children.
Well, wanting them
and caring for them properly
are two different things.
lt's a full-timejob.
For some people.
Yes, the ones that take
the responsibility seriously...
and don'tjust have children to
grati_ their overweening egos.
- Can l showyou something ?
- No, thankyou.
What the hell
is going on here ?
- Would you please
Ioweryourvoice ?
- No, l won't.
l want to know what's eating you.
You have been a total bitch
ever sinceyou came to New York.
l could say
the same thing aboutyou.
- l've simply been reacting toyou.
- For God's sake, don'tyou get it ?
We've grown apart.
It happens to the best offriends.
lt's happened to us.
We might as well face it.
- You're ridiculous.
- l'm ridiculous ?
We haven't grown apart.
You'_e fallen apart.
l don't think l care to pursue this.
So long, CC. Take care.
Why, you stuck-up
little witch !
- When your father died, he took
the best ofyou with him.
- Don't make a scene.
You tried to be an interesting person
for a while, but look atyou now.
You've completely
reverted to type.
You're nothing but a small-minded,
tight-ass little snob these days !
How would a pretentious
little climber likeyou know that ?
- Experience.
- ''Experience'' ?
- l know what's eating you too.
- Really ? What's eating me ?
- Plain, old-fashionedjealousy.
-Jealousy ? Jealousy ?
What am l jealous of?
Your insane ambition ?
No, it must beyour new money.
No, l-l'm jealous
ofyour marriage ofconvenience.
That must be it.
Mywhat ?
Aren'tyou afraid
you got him by default ?
Maybe l am.
But at least
l belong to myself...
which is more
than l can say foryou.
l'm doing what
l set out to do. Remember ?
l'm living the lifeyou didn't
have the courage for.
So don't give me
you're notjealous.
You're sojealous
you can hardly breathe.
Can l helpyou
with something ?
Oh, no.
No, thanks.
Ladies and genttemen...
the captain has turned off
the seat bett sign.
Please feel free
to move about the cabin...
but we do suggest,
foryour own safety...
that you keep your seat belt
fastened white seated.
- l'll be right back.
- Okay.
Butwhatwill l do
without a best friend ?
You've got me.
lt's not the same.
Dear Hill...
Stop sending
my letters back.
l have to talk toyou.
Okay, okay, so we had a fight.
So what ?
Let's make up.
John and l are having
such a terrible time lately.
l don't know
what's the matter with him.
My career's going so well.
Come on, Hill, lighten up.
l'm your only ethnic friend.
Please, Hill, keep in touch.
Love, CC.
Sory. Coming home
for dinner tonight ?
Um, no, sweetie.
l don't think so.
- l'm swamped with work.
- Work, yeah.
- What's on your-- Uh--
- What about-- Sory.
- You were--
- l just wondered whatyou were
going to be doing today.
Me ? l'm going
to myexercise class...
and l'm going
to buya wrench.
A wrench ?
Why ?
We don't have one.
Well, super.
Sounds good.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
l don't think
l'll be too late. Bye.
J
Isn't it nice here in Miami
Arthur ?
Maybeyou ought to think about
moving down here. What doyou say ?
Are we thereyet ?
The neighbor said the beach
across from the Fontainebleau.
Don't wory.
l wait with the puppy.
CC ! CC, my baby!
l don't believe
that it's you !
Y-You-You're a gift from God !
You're a dream !
- You're a dream come true for me !
- l just sawyou last month.
- Who is that ?
- CC Bloom. So eveyone should look ?
- This is my daughter, CC Bloom,
the Broadway star.
- CC, can we haveyour autograph ?
Skedaddle. My friends: Mrs. Valdez,
Mrs. Cohen, Mr. Levine.
- He's in bagels.
- It's a distinct pleasure.
Could you give me five minutes ?
We want to talk.
- Take a dip.
- Nice meeting you.
- Sit down.
- She's a real star.
What doyou mean, you left him ?
What happened ?
After only threeyears,
you left him ?
Was it anotherwoman ?
lt's not a soap opera, Leona.
Eveything with you
is a soap opera.
Tell me, honey. Go ahead.
Get it offyour chest.
Somethingjust died
between us, that's all.
He used to care
what happened to me.
He stopped paying
attention to me.
What's so funny ?
Never mind.
Leona, what's so funny ?
Why areyou laughing ?
Tell me why
you're laughing !
- Ma ! Tell me !
- What ?
All right, l'm gonna tell you.
You want to know ?
l'm gonna tell you.
Why doyou think l'm living
down here in Florida, huh ?
l give up.
You like the sun.
l don't give a shit
about the sun !
l'm here because
it's peaceful ! That's why !
You always wanted
too much attention.
You wanted so much attention
from eveybody all the time
thatyou wore people out.
You wore me out,
you woreyour father out--
may he rest in peace--
by the time
you were 1 5 years old !
Oh, come on.
l loveyou, CC.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, l do.
l loveyou vey much.
But l just can't pay
any more attention toyou.
You know what l mean ?
l want to, but l just can't do it.
And ifl wereyou...
l wouldn't leave anybody
for not paying attention to me.
Because sooner or later, you're
gonna have to leave eveybody.
You understand me ?
Welcome home,
Miss Bloom.
Arthur ! Arthur !
That's it !
- l'm putting you to sleep !
- l got him.
Do me a favor. Take him for a walk
down by the river.
- Maybe somebodywill steal him !
- All right !
John, l'm back.
John ?
John ?
John.
John ?
John, l'm begging you.
Please give me another
chance. Please ?
Please don't leave me.
l loveyou,John.
l need you.
- You don't need me.
What doyou need me for ?
- What ? l need you !
You need an escort ?
You need somebody
to hang up the fur coat ?
Come on. That's not how
l want to spend my life.
l don't care about success
the way thatyou do, CC.
Moving into the mainstream--
You know that never interested me.
We have been fighting
about this for so long.
What's wrong
with success ?
We're Americans. We're
supposed to want to be successful.
- You're too good for it, is that it ?
- Yeah, that must be it.
No, l like it here. l'm happy here.
This is what l do.
l'm not threatened. l'm not scared.
l just-- l'm glad you're a success.
- It makes me happy
thatyou're successful.
-Areyou ?
Yes. l just don't want
to go whereyou're going.
Then l won't go.
You're already gone, Cecilia.
You're long gone.
You're CC Bloom.
What the hell's the matter with that ?
That's great.
That makes me happy.
l feel that in some small way
that maybe l had something
to do with that.
Areyou sure
this is whatyou want ?
Yeah. l'm sure.
l loveyou.
l'll always loveyou.
l just want to let go ofus
before ''us'' gets bad.
Happy anniversay, sweetie.
Oh, Michael.
Oh, we're so good here.
Nobody around.
l know it.
l love it here.
l wish l didn't have
to go back tonight.
Doyou really have to ?
Can'tyou stay one more day ?
- l could quit myjob.
- Good. l'd like it.
One more day, come on.
l'm sory, Hillay.

on Monday.
lfyou're lucky.
Have a good
weekend.
Hi. You're back early
from the beach.
Yeah, it got
rained out.
- It's beautiful now.
- Yes.
That's my robe.
Don't dump me, Freddy.
Don't dump me
when we get back to Lubbock.
The only thing that kept me going
was waiting foryou to come back.
Don'tyou wory about
a thing, little darlin'.
l'm gonna take good care ofyou.
Give me a little kiss.
Stop that.
We didn't rehearse that.
This isn't working for me !
Shit.
- Cut.
- That's a cut.
Cut ! Cut !
- Was there too much dust ?
- It's fine.
- Stop rocking the truck.
- Quit the dust-- Will you
stop the rocking !
Jay, baby, how was the belch ?
Was it real ?
Vey honest, vey good.
What is it this time ?
- l wouldn't do a thing like that !
- Do what ?
Beg this asshole to stick around
after he screwed my sister
and stole myWinnebago.
Whywould somebody like me
do such a pathetic thing ?
Ah ! Because it's notyou.
It's a hooker from Lubbock.
It's called acting.
- Why don'tyou do that until l
tell you to stop ? Trust me.
- Trustyou ?
You haveyour frigging head
in that monitor the whole time !
You haven't said anything
about character or motivation !
You could be watching a Laker game
in there for all l know !
Clear the set,
will you ?
- Clear the set, people.
- Clear the set !
- Clear the set !
- Look, it's no secret, CC.
l didn't wantyou on this picture.
You're trouble.
Your looks are shot.
The bags underyour eyes, doll--
You got enough luggage
in there to go to Europe.
l don't know what
you've been doing to get by.
Maybeyou still thinkyou can
dazzle them with your talent.
l'm here to tell you you're through.
You ain't got it anymore.
You getyour fat ass
back in the truck, and you'll
shutyour smart mouth.
You'll do evey line as written;
eveyword, evey syllable.
-We understand each other ?
- Yes ! You asshole !
Stop it ! Get this bitch
offme ! Come on !
All right !
Show a little respect !
Dear Hillay, Ifyou're still mad at me,
you're gonna love this letter.
My career is now officially
approaching oblivion.
My agent had a brilliant idea.
He thinks l should be a disco queen.
What doyou think ?
Yours, CC.
Look at this.
Your friend, the singer--
She's here in San Francisco.
- CC ? Where ?
-The Pink Palm.
l met my first husband
there.
lt's a snake pit.
Wait till l get my hands
on that agent. l'll kill him !
That toad. He told me
this was a nightclub
with leather banquettes...
and a dressing room
with a door on it !
l mean, look at this place !
It looks like a flamingo
threw up in here !
Lady, lady, excuse me.
We're not open yet.
Well, lookwho's here.
lt's okay.
Oh, Ceece,
l'm so glad to seeyou.
l feel awful
for sending your letters back.
l don't even know what happened
in New York. l don't care anymore.
l wantyou to know,
whatever it was you said...
l forgiveyou.
Go home.
l have nothing
to say to you.
No.
l do have something to say.
You and your damned letters.
Evey time l opened one,
l was happy before l even read it.
Just to get them
made me feel important.
All your crappy stories,
your big dreams !
- l didn't know that.
- Well, what the hell
did you know ?
Did you know how bad
things were for me ?
Did you know my career
was in the toilet ?
No, becauseyou never
answered one ofmy letters.
lfyou'd only answered one,
just one !
Tell me what
ajerk l was, anything.
l don't know how to fight back.
l'm not strong likeyou.
You took awayyour friendship
without even discussing it with me.
That friendship was more
important to me than anything.
l trusted it.
l believed in it.
Butyou didn't.
And now it's gone.
Thankyou vey, vey much
for forgiving me...
but l don't forgiveyou.
l wasjealous.
l was sojealous ofyou
l couldn't see straight !
You did eveything you said
you were going to do ! Eveything !
And your talent !
This incredible talent !
l-l can't even yodel !
Hillay!
What's yodeling
got to do with it ?
You're beautiful.
You're smart.
People look atyou.
lt was all my fault.
No, it was our fault.
No. No, you were right,
whatyou said.
You were right. WhenJohn looked
atyou, it used to drive me nuts.
l can't even think about it today.
Look at me. l start to shake.
Excuse me. Could l have
a Stinger, please ?
Here, here.
- You want something ?
- l can't.
lt wasjust so obvious
he was in love with you.
- Oh, Hillay, itwas ?
- Ofcourse it was.
- Didn'tyou know that ?
- We broke up.
Oh, no.
lt really did me in.
l was so wrecked, they had
to shut down my first picture.
- What happened ?
- It was horrible.
l was terribly edgy.
l wasn't comfortable
in the medium, you know ?
So l broke
the director'sjaw.
Worst ofall
Arthur died'.
- Oh, l'm sory.
- He was hit by a laundy truck.
- He wentjust like that.
- At least he didn't suffer.
No, but l always thought l hated him,
when really l loved him.
- There was no time for me
to show him any affection.
- l'm sure he guessed.
- He never knew
how much l cared.
- No, he guessed.
- People know those things.
- Hillay, believe me,
he wasn't smart.
You shouldn't torture
yourselflike this.
Ceece, wh-who's Arthur ?
My dog.
Remember my Great Dane ?
Oh, he was so stupid,
but he was so sweet.
He used to like to run
after trucks and--
Hillay,
you've got so fat !
l'm not fat.
l'm having a baby.
You're not.
You're having a baby ?
- l'm three months pregnant.
- That's great !
Before l caught him
with that woman,
we made love and--
- What woman ?
- There is this woman,
and l caught them together.
- Michael ?
- Ofcourse, Michael.
And that's when it happened.
Except he doesn't want it
because he's going to mary her.
Can you believe
he's going to mary her ?
Would you make this
a double, please ?
Let me get this straight.
You caught Michael
with another woman ?
Yes.
And nowyou're going to have
a baby all on your own ?
Oh, Hillay,
l think that's so wonderful.
-You do ? Really ?
- l do ! l think it's
the most exciting thing.
And ifit's a girl,
will you name it after me ?
Oh, Ceece.
Baby mine
Do_'tyou cy
Baby mine
- Oh, CC, feel this.
- Dry your eye
Press your head
ctose to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
Littte one
When you ptay
Pay no heed
What they say
Let your eyes
sparkte and shine
Nevera tear
Baby of mine
- No, l wantyou to come.
- Forget it.
- Why ?
- Becauseyou know
how l feel about sickness.
- It depresses me.
- l'm not sick, l'm pregnant.
l know, but this is a hospital. There
are sick people here in the halls.
- You don't want to see
the baby on the screen ?
- Draw me a picture, Hillay.

- l traveled through a hurricane
to seeyou on Broadway.
Really ?
Gee, l hope it was worth it.
Oh, absolutely.
You were brilliant.
And yourwife ? Did she
think it was worth it too ?
Oh, that was
before l was married.
Oh.
Also, she's not
mywife anymore.
l just got divorced
Iastyear.
Oh.
Oh, l'm so sory to hear it.
l mean--
l hope it wasn't too painful.
Areyou ready foryour radar ?
lt's sonar, and l thought
you weren't coming because
you don't like sick people.
Not coming with you ?
Areyou mad ?
l wouldn't dream
ofmissing a chance to see
the little darling on screen.
- What floor ?
- Six.
Okay.
- What did you think ?
l couldn't tell.
- About the restaurant ?
Gee, l thought it was great.
l love that Victorian crap.
Really ? l thought
it would be too provincial
foryou after New York City.
- No, l grew up in the provinces.
- Uh-huh.
Really ?
Where ?
- The Bronx.
- Oh.
- l-l suppose
you're anxious to get back.
- To the Bronx ?
- No, to New York City,
show business and eveything.
- Oh.
Oh, yeah, that.
Maybe l am
and maybe l'm not.
What doyou mean,
maybeyou're not ?
Well, maybe l'm sick
ofthe show business life.
Maybe l want to have something
normal for a change, huh ?
Maybe l'd like to be
a wife and a mother
and-and-and have kids...
andjoin a quilting bee
and have a station wagon.
- Did l hurtyou ?
- No, no, l'm all right.
You mean you'd consider giving
upyour career for marriage ?
Oh, God, yeah.
lfl met the right guy,
maybe.
Okay, Hillay, shutyour eyes.
l can't believe
how perfect this is.
Look.
What do you think ?
Am l the picture
ofa doctor's wife orwhat ?
l don't know what to say.
You hate it.
You hate my hat.
You hate my hair.
No, no, it's the brooch.
Here, wait a minute.
- Ty this one.
It was my grandmother's.
- That's so beautiful.
- It will be perfect.
- You think my brooch is tacky ?
- This will make it perfect.
Don't wory about it.
- Oh, thankyou.
- Eveything will be all right.
- A doctor, a doctor
l can't believe l'm marrying
a doctor, a doctor
lt's foryou.
It's your agent.
You're leaving ?
Just like that ?
l have to.
It's a lead. A lead !
lt's my chance to come
back from the dead.
- What about the baby ?
- l'll be back for that.
l told you that.
- Look, doyou want this ?
l can't reallywear--
- No.
- All right.
What about the brooch ?
- No, l won't letyou do this.

-Justwaltz in and make a mess
and leave it for me to clean up.
l don't know whatyou're
talking about. l told you
l would clean up the room.
l'm talking about Richard,
your fiance.
You're heartless.
You are really heartless.
- Youjust used that poor man
to get back on your feet.
- l did not !
- You did too !
- l did not !
- You did too!
Maybe l did.
But l didn't know l was doing it,
so it doesn't count.
Besides, l feel terrible
about it, all right ?
All right.
Then have the decency
to tell him you're leaving.
Yeah, all right,
l will.
Good.
But l was, uh--
- l wasjust thinking.
- Thinking what ?
l'm in a mad rush
to get back to NewYork.
- l've got to go.
- No.
- He's a vey old friend ofyours.
- No.
- He'd take it coming from you.
- No !
- He's your gynecologist !
- No.
Hillay, please.
Please.
l can't face him.
She's gone ?
lt was the part ofa lifetime,
Richard. Shejust had to go.
l don't understand it.
J ust yesterday
she was telling me how
she wanted to become a nurse.
Here.
You might as well have this.
Oh, thankyou.
It's lovely.

Why don't we get together

Hi, CC.
Gee, you haven't

Neither haveyou.
You look great.
When my agent...
told me it was you who
wanted me for this show, l--
l just couldn't
believe it.
Why me ?
Well, l heard you weren't busy.

You're the only person with enough
talent to play the part.
Soyou'll do it,
even though l'm the director ?
- Sure, l'll do it.
-You will ?
Mm-hmm.
Business is business.
So, rehearsals

1 O:OO sharp.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
What doyou mean,
you can't ?
- Some people are afraid ofsnakes.
- Snakes ?
- What does that have
to do with anything ?
- l'm afraid ofblood.
l'm afraid ofdeath.
l can't even stand to hear
someone say, ''mucous membrane.''
- You were going to be my partner.
- l've made a terrible mistake.
l should have known
you'd do something like that !
This isn't the first time !
What areyou saying ?
The timeyou left me waiting
in the lobby ofthe Plaza Hotel
and you never showed up.
l cannot believe
you're bringing that up again !
lt was the most inconsiderate thing
anyone's ever done to me.
l toldyou a million times
what happened.
l went to the Iranian queen
for a pedicure.
His manic-depressive boyfriend
stole my purse with eveything in it !
- CC.
- Richard.
Hi. Congratulations.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Thanks.

little girl.
Oh, she's so beautiful.
This is the most important
moment ofmy entire life.
Look at her.
She's vey smart.

theWizard ofEvil...
for l am Princess Opgel...
and even he cannot
resist my powers.
l know he locked
Prince Charlie in the tower--
Victoria Cecilia,
areyou in bed yet ?
Yes, Mom.
And she goes to rescue
the princess.
And she goes up
the slimy steps...
and meets the Wizard,
and she kills--
The Wizard of Evil
shows up unexpectedly...
and he grabs
the princess.
He puts her
into a deep, deep sleep...
for at least
eight hours, l hope.
Come on. Let me
pull the bed down.
Just ten more days
till school's out.
You know what ?
l can't wait too.
l don't know aboutyou,
but l am exhausted.
- Loveyou.
- Loveyou.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Pouncer, Pouncer
The wonder cat
l'm so glad
you're _ot a rat
Or a bat or too fat
- Pouncer, Pouncer, the wonder cat
- Victoria, it's time for dinner.
Dear favorite lawyer, that was
great adviceyou gave me.
l held out, and they had
to outbid two other
record companies to keep me.
So l get to do another album, and l'm
going to pick music that l like.
You are the greatest.
Love, Ceece.
But, Mom,
you said l could.
You can invite Melissa the last week
in August, but not before.
But l thought she could stay the
whole month. l already told her.
Then ''untell'' her.
l-l want this summer to be peaceful.
l can't shake this flu.
l'm tired.
l don't want to spend my time
taking care ofother people's
children. Understood ?
Butwhowill l playwith ?
The same children you've
played with evey summer
sinceyou were born:
the ones who live there.
l'm late !
l'm sory, puss.
l'm just so tired.
l'm vey tired.
You're always tired.
Hey.
- Thanks a lot.
- Bye-bye.
- Okay. Hi, Frank.
Gorgeous night, isn't it ?
- It certainly is.
By the way, l want to congratulate
you forwinning the Tony.
- Wasn't that something ?
Did you like my speech ?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
l didn't mean a word.
Did you see those three other
broads gnashing their teeth ?
- Yeah.
- It was great, wasn't it ?
- What's this for ?
- It'll keepyou honest.
- Congratulations
on the Nordoffcase.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Hillay,
doyou have a minute ?
-Just. l'm due in court now.
Well, the attorney
from the drug company
called me this morning.
- Theywant to settle out ofcourt.
- l bet they do. Forget it.
You're being stubborn.
l'm not stubborn.
l'm right.
Look, l respectyou--
We all respectyou--
but get off
your moral high horse and--
Going to court is not going
to solve a thing.
lt'sjust going to complicate
a simple financial deal between
your client and mine.
Hillay ? Hillay,
you all right ?
- Hillay,you all right ?
- Can't breathe.
- What's the matter ?
- She can't breathe.
She can't breathe.
- l don't know what's going on.
- Oh, my God.
Call a doctor, somebody !
- Doyou know C.P.R. ?
- No, l don't.
- Honey,
what can we do foryou ?
- Maybe she's a diabetic.
l don't know. What is it ?
Call 91 1 ! Call a doctor!
Technically, it's called
viral cardiomyopathy.
What that means toyou is that she
will suffer from shortness ofbreath...
fatigue, dizziness.
- Doyou mean all the time ?
- l'm afraid so.
You see, this virus attacks the heart
and damages the muscle.
l don't know how
disciplined she is now...
but she's gonna have
to change her lifestyle.
With proper rest and medicine,
we can slow down the deterioration.
- Hi, puss !
- Hi, Mom.
Come here. Give me a kiss.
l missed you so much.
Missed you too.
- What areyou doing here alone ?
- Aunt Vesta's outside
talking to the doctor.
- Oh.
- Areyou okay ?
- Sure, l am. l'm gonna be home
at the end oftheweek.
- Really ?
- Yeah.
- Good ! What's this ?
See ? l t's how the doctor
can tell what's wrong with me.
- What is wrong with you, an_ay ?
- l caught a virus.
ln your heart ?
Who told you that ?
l heard the doctor say it
to Aunt Vesta.
Yes, l caught a virus
in my heart.
And you caught
three new freckles.
- You've been busy, haven'tyou ?
- Yeah. What's their names ?
- Ellen, BettyAnn and Benji.
- What color are they ?
- Broken windows
and empty hallways
- Hi.
l was wondering
ifyou could help me.
- l want to see eveything
you have on a heart disease...
- A pale, dead moon
- called cardiomyopathy.
- In a sky streaked with gray
Let me look that up foryou.
- Human kindness
- Viral cardiomyopathy.

Hillay, l want to help.
l came all the way from New York.
Just tell me what we have to do.
l've chosen medication
and rest.
But that's not
vey aggressive, Hillay.
- There's lots ofstuffthey can
do for the heart nowadays.
- Sure, l'm on a list for a donor...
but it's unlikely
with my tissue type.
Butyou will
get better ?
Look at it this way:
l'll never have to take
another aerobics class.
W-Why doyou always go
to those crappyjokes, Hillay ?
l mean, l feel
Iousyenough as it it.
These are nice.
l better put them in water

l still want to take Victoria
to the beach house for the summer...
and we can't go alone.
No, ofcourse not.
Well, don't wory about it.
l'll hireyou a nurse.
No, it's all right.
We can, um--
l'll do that myself.
Better put those in water
before they die.
- Where did you get this ?
- Get what ?
This is great.
This picture ofus
in Atlantic City.
Victoria found it
in a box.
Look at us.
l always hated my hair.
What a pair.
Well...

my record...

Maybe l should go to the beach
with you instead ofa nurse.
l'd like that.
Yeah.
Sure.
l set the alarm
on yourwristwatch...
so we'd know what time
to giveyou your pills.
- Areyou okay ?
- Yeah. Why ?

Victoria,

CC's driving,
soyou have to sit in the back.
Will you sit in the back

There's not

When we get there,
will you go swimming with me ?
l can't, but CC will.
Won'tyou, Ceece ?
Yeah, sure.
l love the water.
Never mind.
l'll go by myself.

Um, continue making the castle.

You're right.
We do.
We have exactly
the same hands.
Come on, Pouncer.
- Come on.
- There.
- Hillay, what areyou doing ?

We'll find it.
We'll find it.
lt'sjust gonna
take a minute, that's all.
Here's one.
That's it.
Thankyou.
Come on, you know the words.
l can't.
There's too many people.
Who's watching ?
What's the matter ?
You think
we're gonna get arrested ?
People pay me to do this.
You ought to come see me
work sometime.
- Could l ?
- Ofcourseyou can.
l'll tell your mommy.
Okay, you ready ?
First you put your two knees
ctose up tight
Thenyou swing 'em to the left
and you swing 'em to the right
You step around the _oor

And then you twist around
and twist around with all
ofyour might
Spread your loving arms
way out in space
Thenyou do the eagle rock
with styte and grace
Put your foot way out
and bring it back
And that's what l call
Battin' theJack
Vey good. Vey good.
Take our bow.
Thankyou.
Vey nice.

Bravo !
Bravo !
Hello ? Hold on.

Hillay,

Victoria, tell them
she's not here.
You make me say that
to all your friends.
They're gonna think
l'm holding you prisoner.
l don't care
what they think.
We're going down to the dock
Iater to buy some lobsters.
- You want to come ?
- You know l can't walk that far.
l'm gonna drive.
l'd rather not.
Okay, then, why don'tyou

Hillay, l'm sory

but l know how hard
this is foryou.
No, you don't. You don't know
what this feels like at all.
l'm the one who won't live to see
my daughter grow into a woman...
who won't be able
to protect her from the world.
And l hate that
she'd rather be with you...
who has energy,
who is fun.
You told me
to playwith her !
l know l did, but l didn't know
itwas gonna make me feel like this !
l don't want it

Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Oh, lila, l can't tellyou
how manytimes...
- l've asked myself
that very same question.
- She's gonna do it.
First and foremost,
l woutd have to say...
that CC feets things deepty.
CC is a deepty feeting person...
and, because ofthis,

Do _ou understand ?
Can these two things
