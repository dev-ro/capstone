( 'GOLDEN BROWN' PLAYS )
SONG: § Golden brown,
texture like sun
§ Lays me down,
with my mind she runs
§ Throughout the night
§ No need to fight
§ Never a frown
with golden brown
§ Every time just like the last
§ On her ship tied to the mast
§ To distant lands
§ Takes both my hands
§ Never a frown
with golden brown... §
Flip, turn the fucking TV off!

SONG: § Don't you wanna be
§ A personality?
§ An ocean in the sea?
§ But you'll never make it
if you can't shake it
§ So don't mistake it
Just try and fake it
§ And l want you to know
§ You don't have far to go
§ So we'll use all your dough
§ To buy new clothes
and see what flows
§ And powder your nose
for those photos
§ You're almost on your way
§ To popularity
§ And we'll teach you to play
§ With icy stare
and punk-rock hair
§ And beatnik flare
We'll take you there
§ And there's so many
round like you
§ And we don't care
just what you're doing
§ After we have gone
our separate ways
§ Yeah, yeah
§ Yeah, hey! §

MAN: Fore!
Shit!
MAN: Bullshit!
MAN: lt's not bullshit.
lt's fucking bullshit!
White's bleeding over Orange.
Cradles him in his arms
and says, ''l love you, man.''
lt's fucking bullshit
and even if it wasn't,
they'd say it
like blokes say to each other.
GOLFER: Fore!
( WHACK! )
(Sings) § All the leaves are...
All the leaves are brown
§ And the sky is grey... §
Then Orange says back...
..''l love you too, man.''
Yeah, they're saying,
''l love you, man.''
Not, ''l LOVE you, man.''
§ l went for a walk
§ On a winter's day... §
Why would he say that?
Why would he say
''l love you too,''
if he wasn't a pillow biter?
He's bleeding to death.
You say shit like that
when you're bleeding to death.
§ l'd be safe and warm
if l was in... §
He's been holding it in
the whole time.
He thinks he's going to die.
He has to let it out.
Otherwise, his secret
will be carried to the grave.
Bull-fucking-shit!
l love Danny here.
But it doesn't mean
l'm a fucking chocolate dipper.
l'm no fucking
chocolate dipper, mate.
What about that bit
where they're pointing guns
at each other?
What about it?
Well, maybe it's not really
their guns they're pointing.
There's no way, pal!
No way! No fucking way!
Dude, l've seen it
like 1 8 times.
lt's fucking bullshit!
There's no fucking chocolate
dippers in that movie!
lt's my favourite
fucking movie!
You're all fucking
ruining it for me!

§ California dreaming... §
lt slices a bit
to the right, dude.
Fore!
( WHACK! )
l knew this bloke once, right?
And...
..he used to masturbate so much
that he grew very fond
of his hand.
So much so
that he began talking to it
and he put a little face on it.
And he called it Muriel.
And after a while, Muriel
began to talk back to him.
Fore!
( SPLAT! )
He'd get her
all dolled up in make-up
and specially made
little clothes.
And at night she'd go down
and make intense, mad,
passionate love to him.
Anyway, one night about 3am,
he wakes up in a cold sweat.
And he hears all this panting
and moaning and groaning
coming from the next-door
neighbour's apartment.
And he looks down at his hand...
There's nothing there.
lt's gone.
lt's just this bloody stump.
So he staggers out
into the hallway
and he sees that the next-door
neighbour's door's wide open.
So he pops his head in
and what does he see?
On the bed, his hand, Muriel,
all dressed up to the nines,
make-up on, going down
on the next-door neighbour.
lt's a true story.
Yeah, l heard tell once, dudes,
a guy has about 4,000 times
in him before he's all used up.
That's fucking bullshit!
More like 40,000.
ln your dreams, stick man.
Add it up!
Two times a day,
seven days a week,
for what, l don't know,
40 years?
Two times a day?
Who gets to do it
two times a fucking day?
Me and Jess used to.
Two times a day...
Me and Jess used to do it
five times a day.
For 40 years?
What about hangovers?
What about Christmas Day?
How can you do it five times
on Christmas Day
while the family's sitting
around carving up the turkey?
Make up for it at night
with the wife.
What wife? You haven't had
a wife in over six months.
l haven't got a problem
getting women.
l've got this thing l can do
that sends them gaga.
How exactly do you mean 'gaga'?
Gaga. lnsane, berserk, talking
in tongues. You know, gaga.
What, like some sort
of secret weapon?
Some kind of like
weird sideways movement?
Can't really say, Flip.
But it's pretty special, though.
lt could be worth
a lot of money.
Let's just get this straight.
You're 20-something years old.
You have no job, no money,
very few prospects.
You haven't been seen
in the vicinity of anything
which even faintly resembles
a member of the opposite sex
in over six months.
And yet,
you sit here and tell us
that you have
some kind of special thing
that makes the other side
go gaga.
Well, if it makes them
go so fucking gaga,
then what the fuck are you
doing here with us losers?
Yeah, he's got a point there,
Danster.
Yeah, well,
l didn't say it fixed
all the emotional stuff, did l?
Did l hear someone mention
emotional stuff?.
MAN: A writer?
You're a writer?
l'm a writer.
l worked at Burger King
for three years
before getting this job.
l've got an arts degree.
lf we get you a job that says
you lick toilet bowls,
then that's what you do.
You lick toilet bowls.
(Laughs)
(Mutters) A writer?
Jesus.
You can't write.
l can write.
Philosophical insights...
Direct experience
with the mystery of being...
Dusky whores...
Russian transvestites...
An unfinished thesis on the
1 0 most painful human emotions
does not constitute writing.
Got stuck on jealousy.
lf it points inwards,
it means your heart's full.
lf it points outwards,
it means your heart's empty.
You'd better
spin it round, then.
She might change her mind.
She ran off
with your best friend.
She said
l didn't let her breathe.
She said she needed some space.
You followed her
every time she left.
You sat outside the door
when she went to the toilet.
ls it my fault l worried
l didn't have a reason to exist
whenever she wasn't around?
What about a muse?
Enigmatic, mysterious,
intelligent of spirit...
All great writers have a muse.
What about teletype paper?
Excuse me?
Kerouac wrote on the road on an
entire roll of teletype paper.
He reckoned the pages imposed
an artificial structure
on his stream of consciousness.
l heard tell once, dude,
you write
a story for 'Penthouse',
they pay you 25 G's, minimum.
25 grand?
Yeah, minimum!
lt won't budge. That must
mean something, mustn't it?
Means you're getting fat.
She said she needed
to live a little.
What does that mean,
''live a little''?
Lead melts
at 335 degrees Centigrade.
The last tram
leaves the town hall at 1 1 :05pm.
That's so fucking true.

Anya.
l control the remote.
Understand?
Remote stays with me
at all times.
l do not believe
in the watching of television.
lt is the opiate of the masses.
l'll just pretend
you never said that.
l need to know if the fridge
has ever had any meat in it.
( WHACK! )
l am...how you say...
..non-eater of meat.
Vego.
Vego.
Fridge is cool.
Nothing but poundcake,
beer and fish fingers.
What is this...fish fingers?
Rectangular...
Fish...
Fried.
Crunchy.
Good.

( SPLAT! )
''Enigmatic, mysterious,

You're talking about the girl

One. All intelligence
must be shared.
Wasn't there an Anya
in 'War and Peace'?
Two. Everyone's got to give it
their best shot.
Chemistry, Danny.
Can't beat chemistry.
Three. There is to be no lying,
cheating or backstabbing.
Maybe it's Dostoevski.
'Brothers Karamazov', l think.
Guy who gets the first date

Loser runs around the house

Did you see
the sparks fly between us?
lt's a done deal, my son.
Don't even go there.
l thought
you all hated vegetarians.
True love knows no boundaries,
Sammy.
And she's not adverse
to the occasional fish finger.
Basically, we're willing
to make concessions.
Are we agreed?
l'm not like you guys.
l'm in it for the long haul.
We can deal with that.
We'll work around it.
lt's a bonding thing.
Blokes got to stick together.
All for one, one for all.
That sort of thing.
Guys with hard-ons.
Blood rushes from their brains
to their dicks
and they all
become real stupid.
MAN: Mr Kirkhope?
Yes?
l wonder if we might have
a few moments of your time.
Every month,
$563 is supposed

( VOlCE CHATTERS ON PHONE )
For the last four months,

..for this?
You do know those things give
you brain tumours, don't you?
Um... (Clears throat)
We seem to be going through
a bit of a transitionary
fiscal crisis at the moment.
He means a recession.
We're considering it

Are any of you

Looks like we're in the clear.
Damn good tea.
lt's chai from lndia.
Biscuit?
No, thank you.
We're expecting a big cheque
at the end of the month.
25 G's
from 'Penthouse' magazine.
What do you do?
Pose for a fucking centrefold?
No, l'm a writer. l write
for 'Penthouse' magazine.
No kidding.
You got a machine?
Er, l've got an Underwood.
ls that Mac or Windows?
lt's a typewriter.
Don't sound like
no fucking writer to me, mate.
Oh, well, Hunter S. Thompson
used an Underwood.
Er, Kerouac, Hemingway
used an Underwood.
Stephen King? Stephen King wrote
heaps of stuff on an Underwood.
Are we going
to get our bond back?
Did anyone say
you could talk, dickstrap?
Did anybody here say
you could open your dirty,
fucking, stinking little trap?
lf l get a tumour, funboy,
l'm going to hold you
personally fucking responsible.
Us again.
One of the life forms here
has raised a question
about the bond.
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure. No problem. Can do.
Four months' back rent.
Two months' rent in advance.
End of week.
Otherwise...
Comprehende?
Do you think it's true
about the brain tumour?
Supposed to be.
You can get headset,
you know.
Keep the phone in your pocket,

'Penthouse' magazine?
''Enter me...
''..enter me,''...

''Enter me hard, enter me deep.

''Yes, yes!

''l want you now, entering hard,

''l entered her''?
''He entered me''?
''l wanted him inside me.''
What are we? Cars? Elevators?
Hotel rooms
that guys can crawl inside of,
eat, sleep and leave a big mess
for someone to clear up?
lt's for 'Penthouse' magazine.
l just don't think
anyone should enter
or get entered, that's all.
What about the 25 grand?
1 5?
You want the truth?
( OUTSlDE DOOR CLOSES )
ANYA: This...
Just put it on the right.
You sure
you don't need any help?
Maybe later, l think.
All these words for a woman
who doesn't want sex -

Getting some
serious rays there, Flip?
l'm moontanning, man.
Full moon.
You don't get 'em every day.
No, you don't.
Do you ever wonder
if it's all a big con, Flip?
Eh?
This. Everything.
What if none of it
really exists?
What if it's
like some big experiment,
and we're like ants
trapped in a giant Petri dish?
What if there's
a greater intelligence out there
and it's creating everything
purely as a way
of stopping us
going insane on them?
What if nothing really exists
until we sense it?
My...my room doesn't exist
until l walk into it.
Front yard doesn't exist
until l experience it.
You don't exist.
l don't...exist?
Well, you could be just
a projection of my inner psyche
materialised from my brain
in order to keep me company.
What about the cashmere
sweater babes over the road
with their swishy little skirts
and all?
Would they be
from your inner psyche or mine?
Probably yours, l reckon, Flip.
Took off a while ago
with some rugby types.
Losers, man. Forget them.
No. We're connected, man.
Once you have them
by the moonlight,
they never want to go back.
lt would mean
that when we close our eyes,
everything disappears.
And if we open them
fast enough...
..we might be able to catch
the greater intelligence out
and see that there's
actually nothing there.
What if l kept mine open
while you shut yours?
No, you're just
being stupid now, Flip.
lt doesn't work like that.
There may be some sort
of delay switch happening.
Tomorrow is the shortest day
of the year.
ln pagan times,
it would be time for the king
to be sacrificed...
..and for the queen to select
a new man to be her king.
May l?
Seems a bit rough on
the poor old kings, doesn't it?
lt was a great honour.
Their blood had to be poured
into the ground
to make the earth
fertile again
and the harvest plentiful.
Makes you sort of thankful
for crop rotation, doesn't it?
The female fertility cycle
is 28 days.
The lunar moonth is 28 days.
A month.
No, moonth.
The moonth is a lunar month,
the same
as a woman's fertility cycle.
1 3 moonths
fit exactly into one year.
At the end of the 1 3th moonth,
the king must die.
Oh, well. l guess
if it helps for the harvest...
When the patriarchy took over,
they abolished the 1 3th moonth
to stop
the killing of the kings.
That's why they say
1 3 is the unlucky number.
Why should
1 3 be the unlucky number?
Just because some man didn't
want to be bled to death.
l get very pissed off
about that.
Men are bastards.
l hear about
your secret weapon.
To make us go, how you say?
Gaga?
(Clears throat)
Uh, will you excuse me
for a moment?
GOATEE: l'm telling you, bud,
if this deal comes together,
it's just going to be
one long line of kneeling down,
dick-sucking motherfuckers
waiting for me to come along
and give them a taste
of the big fellow here.
How will you get
the designs on?
l don't see how you'll do that.
(Coughs)
Any fucker propeller head
can do the designs, bud.
Those lines
and dots they've got...
..can be changed
into, like, ridges and bumps
for added sensitivity.
Fucking guy's going to think
he's fucking Tarzan.

Male bonding, remember?
We was doing you a favour, man.
We thought she'd be impressed.
We thought she'd want a taste.

Do you want to get married?
We get married,
we live together.
We sit...

We stare at the same thing.
We have conversation
that lasts no longer
than the commercial breaks
on TV.
And one day,
we wake up.
We look in the mirror...
..and we wonder what happened
to our lives.
You sure that's what happens?
There's no hope?
Very little.
Pages, uh, tend to impose
an artificial structure
on my stream of consciousness.
They don't make
teletype paper anymore.
l've already looked.
Show me your hand.
You are deeply aware
of your own sense of melodrama.
You lack faith in yourself...
..but expect faith in others.
You project your insecurities
onto everyone around you.
You reject happiness as being
shallow and superficial.
You embrace postmodernism...
..to avoid having
an original thought.
You criticise yourself
because...
..it places you
above criticism.
You desire what you hate
and you hate what you desire.
And you always have to kill
what you love the most.
You can see all that?
Nothing is new anymore.
Everything is rehashed.
Do you think there's
such a thing as human nature?
Do you think l can invite
some friends for a party?

Poor little bastard here
nearly froze to death.
You should really
call your mother, Daniel.
She hasn't heard from you
in weeks.
Been doing the figures,
Danny boy.
l've done all the dates,
bought all the flowers,
had all
the candlelit dinners...
Been to gallery openings,
sat through the plays.
Expressed my feelings.
Came up with some new ones
l never even knew l had.
Said all the right things,
told all the right lies,
but still...still not one drop
of affection down south.
You do realise Lenin
wasn't actually his real name?
lt's a completely made-up name.
Like...Bono or Prince.
You see this wallet?
Apparently...rocked up
one morning
and said, ''Call me Lenin.''
$4,873 have passed through this
wallet in the past 1 2 months.
All of it...
..in the sole pursuit of women.
Pity he didn't hang around.
He could have called himself
'The political leader
formerly known as Lenin'.
So, you know what l did?
l got up, caught a cab
to the red-light district,
walked into a brothel...
..pulled out a $1 00 bill
and a very nice girl
took me into her room
and had sex with me
just like that!
l'm a convert, Danny boy.
A true believer.
Just goes to show you
what a postmodern guy he was.
( THUNDER CRASHES,

Fuck!
Sammy!
Your mum says

..try and ring her a bit more.
She's terrified
of commitment, Danny.
Commitment involves feelings,
feelings involve emotions
and emotions
are a fascist construct
forced upon us
over thousands of years
by the patriarchal hierarchy.
l'm beginning to hate
that patriarchal hierarchy.
l wasn't allowed to moan
because it sounded
like a cliche.
l wasn't allowed to gasp
because it sounded
like a cliche.
l wasn't allowed
to say ''l love you''

How do you climax without it
sounding like a cliche?
Do you reckon l should look

l didn't know
there were any unwritten rules
of the moral code of mateship.
Oh, yeah, they're...
they're the biggies.
No sleeping with a mate.
No sleeping
with a mate's girlfriend.
No urinating on a mate's car.
lt's column-of-salt

Your room's
very orderly, Danny.
One of the best we've seen.
How do you know my name?
l'll tell you
how this game works, Daniel.
We're the cops.
We get to ask the questions.
You're the suspect.
You get to complain
about your civil liberties,
perhaps get shot,
maybe even killed.
And it has
to stay like that, Daniel.
Otherwise, everything
falls out of balance.
And when things
fall out of balance,
you know what happens then,
don't you, Daniel?
Your spiritual values
start to decline.
You get your disintegration
of your social structure,
don't you?
The system collapses.
Pestilence, flood, famine...
lt happened to the Romans.
lt happened to the Greeks.
lt happened
to the ancient Mesopotamians.
And we don't want it happening
to us, now, do we, Daniel?
What's this, then, Daniel?
Toilet paper?
l'm a writer.
Pages impose
an artificial structure
on my stream of consciousness.
Well, l guess that would mean
you'd write shit, then.
Wouldn't it, Daniel?
What's going on?
We're the police, sweetheart.
Your civil liberties
are about to be violated.
Oh, great.
lf prostitution
is the rental of the body...
..marriage is the sale.
You're a sick fuck,
aren't you, Daniel?
What is wrong with you?
Haven't you got
anything better to do,
like chasing rapists
or murderers or something?
You know something
about rapes and murders,
do you, sweetheart?
Fuck you.
Sammy.
We refuse
to answer any questions
without the presence
of a solicitor.
You know what we usually
do to places like this, Daniel?
We usually torch them.
So that would make you
the arson squad, then?
(Laughs) You're a tough nut to
crack, aren't you, hard case?
You animals got any guns
on the premises?
Sure, we've got a cache
of paramilitary weapons
up in the attic.
l'll just nip up
and get them, shall...?
No, l reckon
you're on something.
What do you reckon, Stuart?
Put it away, Russ.
You lot on drugs?
Only when we can get them.
lf you don't cooperate,
hard case,
you never know
what might happen.
Nice tatts, man.
You look like a fucking
pincushion down there, mate.
Flip, what's going on?
lt's cool, dude.
Nanna's booked me into rehab.
(Sighs)
lt's a good one. They get you
to make your own bed and stuff.
Let's stop the clowning around,
hard case.
Your friend here led us
a merry chase last night
through numerous brothels,
two nightclubs,
a girlie bar and the casino.
Picked him up
at the blackjack table,
trying to order
half a dozen Asian girls
and a gram of speed
from the croupier.
We cancelled the girls.
Not before he whacked up over
eight-grand's worth of whoopee
on this, though, Danny boy.
That's my card.
lt would seem so, Danny boy.
Seems like you owe $7,257
in rent and damages
to some of our friends
in Brissy, Daniel.
Add that to the eight large...
..notched up
by your associate here.
Which means
you're going to need
the mother of all student loans
to pay that lot back,
aren't you, Daniel?
We refuse to say one more word
until we have spoken
to a lawyer.
l've had just about enough
of you l can take, arsewipe!
Some of our friends
own that casino, Daniel.
And they don't like
being out-of-pocket.
Makes them angry.
Makes us angry.
(Nervously) l need to pee.
Can you hear something, Stuart?
Put it away, Russ.
You know,
like a mosquito buzzing,
or something like that.
Russ! Put...it...away!
He needs to fucking pee,
you fascist pig dog!
( BANG!, THUD! )
Shit.
Big mistake, hard case.
Big fucking mistake.
Fight the power, Daniel!
Fight the power, lain.
STUART: Pity it had to come
to this, Daniel.
And who was to know
it was only a water pistol?
Excuse me?
The gun.
What gun?
Your friend pulled a gun.
We fired in self-defence.
Who was to know
it was only a toy?
Are you insane?
There was no gun.
You look after yourself
out there, Daniel.
Anything could happen,
you know.
And let's face it, mate,
it probably will, won't it?
( SlREN WAlLS )
l'm not your mate.
Maybe...
Maybe it was like,
you know, a Buddhist thing.
He denies your existence,
don't call us, we'll call you,
that sort of thing.
lt's the police, Sammy.
They're hardly likely to be
Buddhists.
They shoot first,
ask questions later down here.
l'm a dead man.
Maybe you're
just losing weight.
lnwards, your heart is full.
Outwards, your heart is empty.
l wasn't exactly expecting
a shower of confetti.
Maybe you should...move on.
lt might not be too sensible
to wait around
for anything to happen.
What about you?
l think l'll...think l'll
stick around here for a while.
Sort of like it.

..that you tune in...
..and chill fucking out.

Nobody asks me

Can't get much better
than 'Penthouse', dude.
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
Sammy?
Flip, what are you doing here?
l couldn't
handle it anymore, man.
lt was like the fucking army
in there.
When they said
l'd have to make my own bed,
l didn't know they meant...
MAKE my own bed, you know?.
Like, out of twigs and shit.
Shit.
Mr Dostoevski, l presume?
l've just been reading
one of your novels, Feodor.
What did you think?
Bit depressing, actually.
l was going through
a dark period.
Had to brush up on all my
pop culture references, Feodor.
Or is it Bragg?
Or maybe it just all adds up
to one Robert J. Corcoran.
Tea?
Letters
for the oppressed minority.
That's not funny, Taylor.
Gay men aren't dying, you know.
What exactly does it mean,
''gay men''?
$7,257 on rent and damages
to a house in Brisbane,
$8,329 owing
to a Melbourne casino,
and $9,392
in credit card fraud.
Leaves a grand total
of $24,979.
They are, like, very fit,
aren't they?
They are all very, very fit.
lt's a summons, Corcoran.
You're due to appear
at Darlinghurst District Court
tomorrow at 1 0am.
Fucking little faggot!
Don't be late, Corcoran.
You can't afford
any more fines, can you?
SONG:
§ Shout, ''Man overboard''... §
They're going
to send me away, Flip.
No, it's not going
to happen, man.
You're the only one.
Only one what?
The only one not into it.
lnto what?
Well, they said at the farm
that l had to find
someone who's not into it
to hang out with.
When l checked it out, man,
everyone's into it.
Seems like
it's an absolute must-have
to have on the CV, you know?.
And you're the only one.
Only one not into it.
They're not going
to send you away.
Been going through
a lot of emotions and stuff.
You know, like...
crying and stuff?.
Been thinking
a lot about things.
Like l was sitting in
the common room the other day
watching a video and stuff,
and this...
..video came on with a band
and an orchestra and shit.
And the tears just started
pouring out of me, mate.
l mean...
..the way those cloths
floated downwards and stuff.
Even though we didn't
hang out together much,
l really appreciated
you being there.
lt was really great.
You're not upset with me,
are you, mate?
l just didn't realise
how heavily into it l was.
Want to know
what the worst thing is?
l can't get an erection.
Can't get an erection, mate.
lt's the...medication,
you know?.
l love you, mate.
l love you too, Flip.
l'm going to get
something to eat. You want?
Oh, jeez, l got the horn!

SONG: § Golden brown,
texture like sun
§ Lays me down,
with my mind she runs
§ Throughout the night
§ No need to fight
§ Never a frown
with golden brown
§ Every time just like the last
§ On her ship tied to the mast
§ To distant lands
§ Takes both my hands
§ Never a frown
with golden brown... §
Flip, turn the fucking TV off!
People are trying to sleep.
Flip, have some fucking
consideration!
( MUSlC STOPS )
For Christ's sake, Flip!
Flipster?
Shitload of paperwork
here, mate.
Shitload.
Must have happened right
in the middle of the Top 1 00.
Just like a junkie, eh?
He'll never know what hit
number one now, will he, eh?
(Snorts)
Typical bloody junkie.
Did you know he was a junkie?
Don't touch anything
until the lab boys arrive.
Never know with these junkies.
Mmm, you never know.
And don't eat the felafel.

ALL: To Flip!
SONG: § l don't believe
in an interventionist God... §
See you around, dude.
§ But l know, darling,
that you do... §
Just some buds, bud.
§ But if l did, l would
kneel down and ask him... §
The essentials of life,
little buddy.
§ Not to intervene... §
Greater love
hath no man, Flipmeister.
§ Not to touch
a hair on your head
§ Leave you as you are
§ lf he felt
he had to direct you
§ Then direct you
into my arms... §
See you, Flip.
§ lnto my arms, O Lord
§ lnto my arms, O Lord... §
Goodbye, strange man.
§ lnto my arms, O Lord
§ lnto my arms
§ And l don't believe
in the existence of angels
§ But looking at you,
l wonder if that's true... §
l love you too, Flip.
§ But if l did,
l would summon them together
§ And ask them
to watch over you... §
This is for you.
She opened it by mistake.
§ To make
bright and clear your path
§ And to walk like Christ
in grace and love
§ And guide you into my arms
§ lnto my arms, O Lord... §
We're off to Paris.
Anya says they take actresses
much more seriously over there.
§ lnto my arms, O Lord... §
l think l should
dye my hair black.
Wouldn't l look much more
like a babe with black hair?
We should go
to the Cannes Film Festival.
There's all sorts of producers
and directors over there.
l'd love to network
with those sort of people.
Can l borrow your phone?
Yeah. Can l speak
to Sergeant O'Neil, please?
Tell her it's about
Robert J. Corcoran.
(Danny plays acoustic guitar)
TAYLOR: lf l was gay,
l wouldn't be worrying
about fucking all...
How could you, Taylor?
(Dirk cries)
Everything will be alright.
Now there's no National voters
or footballers here.
TAYLOR: Oh, just trying
to do my straight man...
l've got something for you.
What?
Teletype paper.
( CAR ENGlNE STARTS )
What?
(Laughs quietly)
What?
( POLlCE SlREN WAlLS )
Do you want to get married?
Can't. Got to go out later.
l don't know if it's all
it's cracked up to be, anyhow.
There's just one more thing.
Mmm?
Berserk.
Gaga. Talking in tongues.
Well, you know. l may have
exaggerated that part a little.
