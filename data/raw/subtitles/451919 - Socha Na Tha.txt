stop the car.
- What for?
Just stop
Hold it! Not inside the car
Do it here.
- It's not that
Then?
- Look
That's Aditi's house
Behind that balcony
is her room
That's where she stays.
- Bloody drunkard
You're getting married.
Stop flirting around now
come on
flirting, eh!
"You and I..."
"how are we related?"
"In no way"
"should you..."
"look at me pass by..."
"can you ignore me?"
"Probably no"
"should we..."
"never meet again..."
"will I miss you?"
"No"
"Because, you don't mean
anything to me"
"I know it"
"You don't mean anything to me..."
"yet you aren't a stranger to me"
"With strangers..."
"I was never..."
"so articulate"
"What came from the heart..."
"I kept on rambling"
"I never felt..."
"apart from you"
"so close to you..."
"I was..."
"I feel"
"Yet, you mean nothing to me"
"Perhaps, I'm still hopeful"
"When you mean nothing to me..."
"why don't you feel like a stranger?"
You told her father that
your parents have no objections
But when people here find out,
d'you know how they'll react?
Give me an idea
You remember me when you need me!
If I support you...
all of them will consider me a vamp.
- My heroine can never become a vamp
And stop that melodrama.
I know you're going to help me out
Why did you hide this from me
for three years?
But you're the one
I broke the news to
I told someone else too.
- Who?
Aditi. Mr Malhotra...
we had been to their place
You're crazy, viren.
Why did you have to tell her?
I don't know, babhi (sister-in-law).
There's something great about her
I share everything with her
share? You were in that room with her
for just five minutes
What all did you share with her?
- In that room...
in Goa...
- Goa?
You mean she was with you in Goa?
You lied, eh?
I couldn't have said that
Karen was there too...
and I was carrying on with her
How do you find her?
- How'd I know?
You never introduced us.
- You've met her
When have I met Karen?
- Not Karen. Aditi. How's she?
You want to marry Karen, don't you?
- Yes
Then why is Aditi dropping in?
- Aditi isn't dropping in, babhi
I'm just asking.
- Don't! Keep your mind clean. Dig?
Just think up an idea to work
things out, to tell your father
Nirmal? He will exile me
But you got to tell him anyway, right?
- Yes
And tell him before he finds out
from others
Dad...
I know what I'm doing
What's right and what's wrong,
I can tell
What does nature teach us after all?
Love others
Love is a string that binds
all of us together
Where's your master?
- In the garden
Jump into the ring, kid,
and face it
What have you achieved in life?
How could you think that...
we'll accept any girl you love?
Have you seen such a thing happen
in our society, viren?
Maybe same religion, same caste, still
no one marries outside the society
Did Lord Krishna say in the
Holy Geeta that, do anything...
but don't marry a catholic?
Religion, customs, society...
know why they were created?
To rein in morons like you.
Get that?
Countless girls in our society!
If there were none, we'd understand...
that you are looking for girls
of other faiths. Am I wrong?
What will she teach your kids?
Can she instill our culture in them?
I'm there for them. Besides,
viren doesn't intend to elope
He's asking for your permission.
- Namita...
don't favour him anymore. It has
become a fashion in the cities
The moment kids grow up,
they become boyfriends-girlfriends
Does he even know about relationships?
- It's not like that, daddy
viren is not a kid anymore.
- Why? Has he proved to be an adult?
He came from America 9 months back.
Has he been to office even once?
Did he ever talk about work?
- Daddy...
Enough. I've decided.
Viren is not marrying that girl
No one takes up this subject anymore.
Understand?
I'm sorry if I've been nasty
I was afraid viren might
walk out of this house
I thought if we agree with him,
he might understand us too...
and take up responsibilities.
And that's why...
No good, viren... no good
They have decided.
- On what?
On what? What's this family talking
about since last two weeks?
I see
What's so important on tv?
What's that?
Isn't she the one...?
- Yes. Aditi
People are fighting here because
you want to marry a catholic girl
Daddy is yelling,
mummy is enraged...
Naren and I have lost our minds
trying to reason with them
All because of you. And here you are,
watching some other girl on video
What's going on?
I don't know, babhi.
- Then find out!
If you can't, then forgive us
Must find out
viren...? What are you upto?
Go back
Go inside, viren
I've come to find out something.
- Find out...
how they're going to throw me
out of the house?
Angry with me?
- Very
Will you hit me?
- Yes, I'll kill you
What's this Aditi...?
Between you and me?
I've never felt like this before
With Karen...
I thought it was love
If that was love...
what is this?
Leave
Go, viren!
Am I in love with you?
- I'm really going to kill you, viren
You'll kill me?
And why not?
"Close to my heart..."
"O my love..."
"I'll ever draw you,
I never imagined"
"This moment of love..."
"answers to all my questions..."
"I will find,
I never imagined"
"Those eyes I behold now..."
"I've been looking for ages"
"Those eyes resemble..."
"the eyes I dream about"
"In reality..."
"the love of my dreams..."
"I would find,
I never imagined"
"close to my heart..."
"O my love..."
Aditi, food is served.
- Coming, aunt
What I set out to seek...
I've found
"In loneliness..."
"I would sometimes get lost"
"I'd not be my own self"
"You'd invade my very being"
"That strange mistake..."
"and these repercussions..."
"would come my way,
I never imagined"
"close to my heart..."
"O my love..."
"I'll ever draw you,
I never imagined"
"This moment of love..."
"answers to all my questions..."
"I will find,
I never imagined"
Dad is in!
Go away
for the first time today,
I felt that...
you are right, and I'm wrong
You are right when you said that
religion, society are fine...
but love towers above everything
Look... love has brought us together
Don't stand rooted there, moron!
Daddy has agreed
I knew you'd mess things up
D'you remember the cinema hall?
How's Karen from within,
from outside, et al
shall I tell her everything?
- Why be afraid when you are in love?
Tell her, "Karen, now that everyone
has agreed to our wedding..."
"why don't we just drop the idea?"
"Because I don't love you"
"Besides, it's no good marrying
someone you don't love"
Well, can't Karen drop me?
Are you crazy? Why would she?
She won't. But her father
will certainly refuse
How's that?
Mr fernandes is a hot-tempered man.
- So?
He could do anything
in a fit of rage
Greetings, uncle
Oh come on, uncle. I don't belong
to a family of drunkards
But you are... well,
carry on, uncle
Amba, Ambika, Amrapali,
Amita, Amulya
Mummy likes Ambika,
my sister-in-law likes Amulya
I'll make do with anything.
What do you suggest?
I don't understand.
- A name for your daughter
Got to change her name. She won't
remain a christian after marriage
The priest says,
according to her birthchart...
her name should begin with "Am"
No one spoke about conversion
This young man's here
to talk about it
Look, we are... hang on! I hope she
has stopped eating non-vegetarian fare
Pure vegetarian!
After marriage when she drops in here,
this house should be pure vegetarian
And booze...
well, it's fine now
But after the wedding,
when you sit for the "pooja"...
Pooja, who?
- You won't sit for the prayers?
Who said we'll go through
Hindu rituals?
Dad
He said everything was obvious...
fernandes is wise enough,
he'll understand
But brother said, "No, the old man does
not have a sound mind for a guesswork"
He asked me to go and explain things
to you, so here I am
They acted so understanding!
And you...!
You said you don't believe in religion
when you came here to propose marriage
"shaadi". Our society doesn't
call it a marriage
so now you remember
your damn society, eh?
Not a word against my society
It's our custom. For the sake
of Ambika, you will have to follow it
Ambika?
Ambika is the best name, I think
Keep your thoughts to yourself,
you jerk!
We're minorities. You think we'll
reel under your pressure, eh?
Good I didn't need to explain
You'll understand
the other things too
Good we discussed these things.
All the confusions stand cleared now
Don't you think you're
getting a bit too hot?
Hot, eh? If I flare up,
your dead body will leave from here
What are you saying? Think it over
before you break the wedding
It's a consolation for you because
I'm not breaking your neck
What a thing to say! I know you will
be ashamed of all this tomorrow...
and you'll drop Karen at my place.
- Not even a bitch at a place...
where such scoundrels live!
- This is between us, Mr fernandes
Don't call Karen a bitch
I'll break all your bones
and present them to your old man
He'll call off the wedding
I heard
What happened, Karen?
- As if you don't know, eh?
I really don't know, Karen
That's the innocent facade
you put up to lure boys?
In Goa, you said you will help us!
- What's the problem?
She's poisoning my fiance's mind.
She wants him to break off with me
I know it is because of you
that he's trying to avoid me
fiance?
- Viren
There's some confusion.
I've really no idea...
You stuck to him like a parasite,
and now you've ensnared him
He slipped once, but that
doesn't mean that he'll drop me
Your stupid plan
just won't work, Aditi
I got it. What the girl said,
was all a lie
What was seen was a lie, the
excursion to Goa was also a lie...
sonal said viren held your hand...
that was a lie too
Your entire world is a lie.
You are the only one who is right
Isn't that what you want to say?
Friend, swim this one sea across,
and you'll have made it!
Tell uncle everything,
don't be scared
I'm not scared. I respect him,
he's my father
Oh yes, you must.
Carry on
I'll stay here
Look, I don't want to talk to you
No, not another word.
Please hang up
This is the limit!
You aren't even listening
I'm not interested in chatting
you up either. Look, Mr Oberoi...
I'm fixing my niece's wedding. If I
see your son, that loafer, around...
My son won't even come to spit there.
Don't you dare call up again
What did she say, Dad?
- Nothing. She was rambling that...
he is still interested
in Malhotra's niece
she has no idea that he's picking
everyone's brains for Karen's sake
Listen, if you come across that girl,
you don't need to be friendly
Who?
- Malhotra's niece
I say, they are scum
Besides, it's about a marriage.
There could arise a situation...
where they can even blackmail us
How's september 27 for your wedding?
Dad, actually...
Is september too early?
No...
Too late, probably?
Reason with your kid brother.
- Understand, kid brother
When you've waited three years,
be brave for three more months
Look, we haven't yet fixed the date.
Tell us if you have a problem
say something
Nothing.
- So let's fix september 27?
Yes.
- Final?
Final
Now! Right now!
I tried to call you up twenty times.
Well, did Karen come here?
This could be our last meeting,
so listen carefully...
Don't say that.
- Your wedding is fixed
And mine is being talked about inside.
Our fate is decided
What do you mean? We're to decide
on our fate, not someone else
Understand my predicament. Uncle and
aunt have taken care of me for 7 years
They've done so much for me.
There's no way out
If you think negative, obviously
there won't be a way out
How are you going to convince everyone
that you don't like Karen anymore
You fought with everyone for her,
you dreamed for her
Why the hell do dreams come true?
If mine was to come true,
then why didn't I dream about you?
I wasn't a dream, viren. I wanted you
to accept my love once
I do! I do, I'm telling you
Wake up, viren! For God's sake,
be practical
Not every wish of us is granted
I met Karen's father...
- someone is coming here, I'm going
Hurry back, I'll be waiting here.
We'll decide what we must do
Nothing doing anymore.
I'm not coming back
Why do you concede defeat?
Listen to me...
No more, viren.
There's no way out now
There could be a way out, Aditi.
Be prepared
No. Not a word more, viren
Listen, Aditi...
Your aunt wants you
Let's go
What's the matter?
Babhi...
I've been thinking over it
Everyone was against Karen first
They had a logic behind that.
We have convinced them now...
but have we proved their logic wrong?
Everyone spoke about the ways
of this house...
about a girl of the same society
who'd handle things, like you
I don't want to be selfish
Now, to have my own way, will I
upset them? I can't do that
It's that girl, right?
What stuff are you made of, viren?
To marry Karen, you had
made our lives miserable
And now that everyone is fixed, you're
saying that you don't want her...
and you feel you want Aditi
You... are you mentally ill?
I don't like doing all this
Then why the hell are you doing it?
Because I can't do anything else.
I have no choice
Aditi is a nice girl.
You will like her, I know
No viren, I won't like her
Because everytime I see her,
she'll remind me of your betrayal
Where are you?
Who's up there? Get down! C'mon
Don't go inside!
You were right! This world
won't let us live together
Who wants to live
in this world anyway?
What's this?
Is he the guy?
Aditi, show him around your room
I was shown around too
Where's he?
- Inside, sir
Aditi, I've forsaken everything...
my house, my parents
I had to make a choice, I chose you.
They can't harm us, Aditi
You and I are adults. Come with me,
I'll take care of everything
You know the truth, Aditi. Just
come with me. Nothing else matters
Hold it! One minute!
Leave him
viren, this is Mahesh. My boyfriend
I used to jump from the balcony
to meet him, I told you. He's the one
We had some misunderstanding,
but everything is clear now
What are you doing?
I told you
not to concede defeat
And what did I tell you?
I told you to come out of your dreams
cut the crap!
Look...
it's a very important moment
in our life. Don't make a mistake
I've made up my mind
It's decided, viren!
I'll do as I please. Get that?
This is my life, my decision
Take him inside
What's all this?
- He's insane
He has screwed our minds of late
He won't anymore
Over there
You used to boast off
about your son...
that you had implicit trust
on him, et al
But now when people have come here
to seek an alliance...
your son has sneaked into
my niece's bedroom, like a thief
I'm a bit confused now
as to what to do with your son
should I turn him in to the cops?
Or have him whacked?
You are the wisest of them all,
so I thought I'd ask you
No, Mr Malhotra...
don't take my opinion
Today it is proved that my words
carry no weight
He's your culprit. You can do
anything you want with him
As far as I'm concerned...
I've nothing to do
with him anymore
What do we do with him?
Take him out of my sight, Papa
Else, I don't know what I'd do
Aditi has said
what he wanted to hear
What's wrong with you?
Daddy is saying something...
your father is saying something else.
I thought I pity you
I even went over to see you.
You saw me and ran off. Why?
Where did you go?
What's come over you?
Know what I went through last night?
I'll fix him! Now that he is here,
he won't go back home walking
viren, look at me
I'm with you,
everything will be fine
I'll talk to Daddy,
he will give in
Believe me, he will. And everything
will be fine like before. Yes, viren?
I don't love you, Karen
I know, if I say yes, everything
will be normal again
But that will be a lie
What do I do?
I'm not in love with you
I was very nasty with you folks
But I can't pull back
what I've already done
Here, I stand before you.
You can do whatever you please
I was always scared of you
But today, for the first time,
I'm not scared of you
I feel sorry for you...
for having got a son like me
You always tried to make me
see reasons, but in vain
But yesterday, for the first time,
I gathered everything in a single day
What I did...
it is all over now
What happened with me,
I deserved it
But what happened with you,
shouldn't ever have happened
What you heard because of me...
Wherever I go...
I'll try to turn a new leaf
That's all.
- Listen...
Iook at me
come
My son!
I'm tired, Dad...
of lying, and from trying to run away
from responsibilities
I don't know why I did that
I always wanted to be like you
But I couldn't
come on inside...
come, daddy
Jaswant, drive in
c'mon

Pooja... Anuj,
come this side and play
Is Aditi in?
- Yes
Engagement?
- Yes
I'll call you later
Mahesh, right?
- Yes
viren told me. When is the wedding?
- Next month
so soon?
So you're happy...?
Yes
You don't appear to be happy,
I don't know why
No point discussing it.
What had to happen, has happened
What had to happen, has happened!
So simple. Isn't it?
What happened, didn't happen
on its own. You did it
Everything was fine earlier,
and you could've let things be
But no, you had to drop in between
and destroy everything
And now you're marrying someone else
I know how I reasoned with myself,
to come to terms with it
viren doesn't think of me
the way I think about him
Because he's in love with you.
He loves you...
and you love him. Then why
aren't the two of you together?
Let's not talk about it, Karen
What else can you and I talk about?
I want to know why you're doing this.
You are not crazy
There must be a reason.
Tell me
I had promised uncle that
I'd marry the boy of his choice
It's only because of a promise?
D'you have any idea
what state viren is in?
What stuff are you made of, Aditi?
D'you have a heart?
D'you even feel?
- No Karen, not at all
I just want to destroy my life!
- I'm not interested in your life
No one is interested, I know.
Why did you come here, Karen?
Do you think you can...?
He's suffering exactly like this.
That's what I wanted to tell you
Give me five minutes, sis
These tears will take
some time to stop
It's too late. The invites
have already been sent
Nobody can help you either
You will have to do it
all by yourself
lt'll create a furore here,
we'll all be tense for some time
viren and you, that's how
all of us wanted earlier
Maybe, after a while all will realise
that it happened the way they wanted
You mean...? What should I do?
What do you want?
What says your heart?
Guests have arrived. Mahesh and
family will arrive any moment
You will be summoned downstairs, and
the engagement ceremony will begin
Tell me, what do you want to do?
What says your heart?
But actually...
This balcony... I have climbed down
several times
You'll go now?
- Yes
Go on, hurry
I'll watch the door
son...
this is our dream project
It's all in your hands now
Where to...?
You...?
- Where's he?
Where is he?
Thousands of years back, during
the Indus valley civilization...
It has happened before
We tend to leave behind
ancient wisdom
But the same wisdom comes back in the
form of vaastu, feng shui, et al
stability is the key
to this structure
for stability, you have rejected
several architectural designs
It's complicated.
It's a very tall building
But it isn't taller than the Red fort
or the pyramids
They were successful in building
such huge structures sans technology
lmagine what we can achieve now,
with sophisticated technology
Why are you here?
- Viren, I want to...
Is everything fine?
- Stop grilling me
Won't you let me reply?
- What if you're seen here?
If you know, then go away.
- Listen to me, viren
We can't talk here
You ran away from your house, right?
You ran off and came here...
and you want us to elope, right?
Are you out of your mind?
You sneaked into my bedroom, and in
public you asked me to elope with you
And you had me thrown out
All right, you have me thrown out.
Call the guard. Guard!
Throw me out!
You want to take your revenge, right?
I know.
- So what?
I'll award you the Nobel Prize
for this brilliant plan
can anyone be so stupid?
You thought you'd come here and
I'd be glad to elope with you, eh?
Right
That's what I thought.
I was wrong, no?
Of course, you were wrong
Did you actually think it's possible?
I'm talking to you
Why?
Is eloping the right way?
That's what I used to tell you, viren
Yes, but everything has changed now
Despite what happened,
my family has accepted me
I tell you... go back home
viren, if I ever need an advice
in life, you will be...
the last person
I'll fall back upon
Why? Why does everyone
tell me like that?
I just asked you to go back home.
Am I wrong?
I'm getting engaged, viren
You left the engagement
and...!
Do they know you've run away?
- I don't know
Who doesn't know?
You? Or them?
Anyway, what are you going to do now?
No idea.
- What crap! Find out then
What is it to you anyway?
- Stop acting pricey
Don't pay heed then. Go to your dad,
he'll get you a bride...
who won't act pricey at all.
- I can't trust Dad's choice
You were his first choice. Besides,
you've given your engagement a slip
Listen! At least I did
what my heart desired
I'm not saying you did a wrong thing.
You know, walking out of this place...
and doing a vanishing act
in just one pair of dress...
there's no money either...
it's all so strange
Is this logical?
- Then why are you following me?
You know why.
- I don't know. Please tell me
Because...
I want to explain to you that...
- Taxi!
I understand that
there's no other way, but...
eloping, eh? Okay,
how does it sound, "Eloped"?
Okay viren, I got it
Good you followed.
It's important to be practical
Move.
- Where to?
Go straight for now,
I'll tell you soon
viren isn't here as yet
He won't come so soon.
It'll take some time
A couple of weeks,
a month or so, perhaps
Both of them will return.
- Both...?
You got to take decisions calmly,
after much discussion
And what a place this is
for a conference! A taxi!
No disturbances here
Of all the options...
eloping is not an option at all
Tell me something.
What if I go over...
to Mr and Mrs Malhotra
and seek that girl's hand...?
It won't seem proper after
all that happened. We'll lose face
Dad...
But if these two
do something today...
no one can help it.
Everyone will have to accept them...
and I'll accept too
Now I understand
who viren has taken after
Why? Did I say anything wrong?
You seem to be
on the wrong side today
I'm your father!
- Not mine alone
You are the father of them all!

"Let's together..."
"change the course of the winds"
"come, let's resolve..."
"let's make a promise"
"My love, it's our resolve,
it's our promise as well..."
"even if God seethes in anger..."
"even if the crazy world
forsakes us..."
"like a heartbeat I'll always
beat in you heart"
"I want to behold you for ever"
"I want to think about you for ever"
"I want to fight with you"
"With you I shall make promises too"
"The way I love you..."
"no one does"
"I wish for a place..."
"where the earth and the skies
shall belong to us"
"My love, this is where..."
"you and I will create
a paradise for ourselves"
