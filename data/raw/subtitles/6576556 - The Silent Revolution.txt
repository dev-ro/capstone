BORDER BETWEEN EAST
AND WEST BERLIN, 1956
Train from Stalinstadt
to the American sector...
5 YEARS BEFORE THE BERLIN WALL
Please have your ID ready.
Hello.
Papers, please.
What's that?
My toothbrush.
Are you planning to leave the country?
No.
I'm a bellhop.
At the Kempinski Hotel, in the West.
I'm on the nightshift.
It's for tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
And where are you headed?
- Südstern.
We're visiting my grandfather's grave.
So you're just tagging along?
I'm the one with the green thumb.
Happy birthday, Grandpa.
I can't think of a single reason
why anyone would let themselves be shot.
No reason at all?
No, Kurty.
Dead is dead.
Come on, Kurt.
We've got to go.
Hey, Theo.
- What?
Check out those radios.
- The movie's about to start.
Come on.
"Liane."
How are we going to get in
without money?
We'll figure it out.
Through here.
Are you sure?
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.
This isn't going to work.
- Hey, hold on.
Oh, I know.
Do you think they're really like that?
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.
We were already inside.
- Ditto.
Those two guys behind us are odd.
Thanks for letting us tag along.
We followed you in.
We noticed.
- We didn't have tickets.
Hungary.
The people revolt
against Russian occupation.
Hundreds of thousands demonstrated
in Budapest on Sunday
for freedom of the press,
free elections
and the end of Soviet domination.
They demanded their own government
led by opposition leader Imre Nagy.
They're booting the Russians out.
Students chanted,
"We'll never be slaves again,"
before burning the flag
of the hated occupiers.
When protestors
tried to storm Radio Budapest,
authorities responded with force.
Emboldened by desperation,
Hungarian freedom fighters
courageously battled the Soviet tanks.
Instead of subduing the rebels,
the Hungarian Army joined them.
"Hungarians don't shoot Hungarians,"
they said.
As a result, the Russian tanks
were driven out of the capital.
Is this the hour of victory
for Hungary's young freedom fighters?
There they are.
Hi, Evi.
- Good evening.
Can you bring us a round?
So? Were you at the movies?
- Of course.
Did you see her boobs?
- Yes, but...
Are they as good as everyone says?
- Is she topless for all of it?
Marion Michael
spends the whole movie topless.
Right, Evi?
Because it's so hot in the jungle.
Nice going.
I want to see Liane's boobs, too.
You too, Erik?
- I'm not watching that indulgent filth.
We saw something else, too.
The weekly newsreel.
Wow. The newsreel.
Were there naked girls?
- No, morons.
They showed the Hungarian revolt.
Masses are demanding Russian withdrawal.
It's a fascist counter-revolution.
Here.
HUNGARY CRUSHES COUNTER-REVOLUTION
"On October 23rd, foreign imperialists
and counter-revolutionary elements
attempted an armed putsch
against the people's state."
But their leader is Imre Nagy.
- What revolt?
I didn't hear about that.
- You dunce. Read.
The fact is, they're trying
to send the Russians home.
And that's great.
Yeah.
Those jerks should all clear out.
Let's go. Out.
Crap. What now?
Split up. Go!
Come on.
Come on, Kurt.
It was just a stupid joke. I'm sorry.
How old are you?
18.
I'm 21.
I don't want to be here either.
You damn Nazi kids.
We should've wiped out the lot of you.
Thanks.
- Care for a dumpling?
No, thanks.
Father.
Are fascists leading
the Hungarian revolt?
The situation in Hungary
is complicated, Kurt.
Then please explain it to me.
I don't have all the details.
The reports arrive with some delay.
All we know is that a counter-revolution
against the people's socialist state
is underway.
It's probably like the uprising
we had here in '53.
Foreign agitators
were involved then, too.
We talked about it
at the factory today...
Were you in the West again?
Did he visit your father's grave again?
It was his birthday.
I just took some flowers.
You'll get me into trouble.
Don't you two understand that?
The city council chairman's son
putting flowers on an SS man's grave...
He was a simple infantryman.
In the Waffen SS.
Did you see footage of the Hungarian
revolt at the movie theater?
Was it Theo's idea?
Theo.
Karl, Jakob.
Let's go, kids.
Lemke family, wrap it up.
You're doing homework now?
I'm done.
- I have to eat my oatmeal.
Then eat.
Hurry, Dad's yelling.
- Yeah.
Jakob. Karl.
- I'm nearly done.
Come on.
What's that?
- It's a clover.
It's a four-leaf clover.
Come on.
- Yeah.
Wait a second, Dad.
Bye, Theo.
I love you, Theo.
I love you, too.
They'll all be there.
Look who's here.
Theo?
Theo.
You're graduating this spring.
You need to focus on your exams.
It's important.
Yes, I know.
You needn't worry.
I'm on top of it.
I'm proud of you, my boy.
See you later.
Morning, Theo.
- Good morning.
Good morning, sunshine.
- Good morning, Theo.
I have something for you.
Really? What is it?
A good luck charm
for when you take your exams.
That's extremely rare.
Yeah, well...
Will you keep it for me
so it doesn't get lost?
Sure.
Come on.
It's the flag ceremony.
Hurry up.
Pioneers and Free German Youth,
at attention.
We open this ceremony
with the Pioneer greeting:
For peace and socialism, be ready.
Always ready.
And the Free German Youth greeting:
Friendship.
- Friendship.
Did the Russians catch you?
Yes. But nothing happened.
You know you're nuts, right?
That could've meant big trouble.
What happened?
- Theo threw a nut at a Russian's head.
What? Why?
Because of the Hungarians.
Did you throw one, too?
Nah.
I think it's brave
that they're revolting.
Morning.
- Morning, Paul.
If you want to know more about Hungary,
we could go to Edgar's
and hear what RIAS has to say.
Right, Paul?
- No, I... No.
The reports from the West
are way different.
It's propaganda and it's forbidden.
I'd go.
- I'll come then, too.
Me too.
- We're not going.
We would've lost the war
in Czechoslovakia with you bozos.
I'd like to put a bullet
in his Nazi skull
and splatter his filthy brains
across the wall.
That's disgusting, Erik.
Come on, Paul.
My parents quit talking to Uncle Edgar.
No one has to know.
Don't go. You know old Edgar...
- Quiet!
...has the hots for you.
Nonsense,
we'll be there as a group.
And then he said,
"You're graduating this spring."
And then I said, "You needn't worry."
- I'm not.
What?
Someone still lives here?
- Yes, my great-uncle.
What happened?
The Russians torched his farm in 1945.
And there he is.
Paul, my boy.
My dear boy.
Nice of you to come by
and visit old Edgar.
We've got a question, Edgar.
We'd like to know what the West
is reporting on the Hungarian revolt.
Yes.
And so you've come to see old Edgar?
Do you want to secretly listen to RIAS?
Then you've come to the right place.
Come along.
Come on in.
- Come on.
This is RIAS Berlin.
A free voice of the free world.
Hungary.
Insurgents sustained
tragic losses in their fight for freedom
against the Russian occupying forces
last night.
The number of fallen freedom fighters
could not be precisely determined.
But according to current estimates,
several hundred were killed,
including the captain
of the Hungarian national soccer team,
Ferenc Puskás.
Puskás is dead.
- They can't just shoot people.
Hundreds were killed.
The Russians used tanks to take action
against an oppressed populace
that desires freedom.
In Strasbourg,
members of the European Common Assembly
stood in memory
of these Hungarian national heroes
and observed two minutes of silence.
Listen up, everyone.
Let's have a moment of silence,
for the Hungarians.
What?
We'll have two minutes of silence in
memory of our fallen Hungarian comrades.
Are you crazy?
What's the point of socialism
if we kill socialists?
He's right.
You don't get it.
Fascists and capitalists
want to ruin the USSR.
Exactly.
One "fascist" the Russians killed
was your soccer hero, Ferenc Puskás.
Puskás is dead?
That's not true.
It's true, Erik.
Puskás is dead.
What?
Imre Nagy is the opposition leader.
He's a socialist, not a right-winger.
Yeah, the Russians need to get lost.
So you can see titty movies here
instead of in the West?
Mosel's coming.
Let's vote on it.
Who's for a moment of silence?
Hungarians our age are dying.
Twelve.
That's a majority.
Friendship.
We'll go over the material again.
"The state
of pre-revolutionary Germany."
What was the position
of the Social Democratic Party in 1918?
Paul.
No? Nothing?
That's another F for you, Paul.
Hands out of your pockets
when I speak to you!
Kurt, you tell us.
Kurt, I know you know the answer.
Why aren't you saying anything?
Why aren't you saying anything, Kurt?
And you, Theo?
This is very funny, isn't it?
Say something, damn it.
I want to know what's going on.
I want to know what game you're playing.
Lena.
What...
is going on here?
I want to know what's going on!
It's a sign of protest.
What did you say?
Please repeat what you said.
"It's a sign of protest."
A protest against what?
Against me?
Come on, Theo.
Let's have a smoke.
Listen here.
We've never been more united as a class.
You can come down from there now,
Kurt.
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Our graduating class
is a good group.
They're staunch socialists.
We're doing good work here, Comrade.
Or should we be asking ourselves
if that's the case?
No.
Who knows what got into them.
I'll put it this way...
I think we should keep the matter
between us.
As they say, a farmer who fears
every cloud is a lousy farmer.
If you say so.
Comrade Ringel,
Stefan and I are nearly done.
I'm here about the same matter.
Comrade Mosel informed me
of the graduating class's disobedience.
Are you nuts?
- You're about to find out.
Enough.
That was a nasty foul, Erik.
I'm fine.
- Theo.
Guys, we're done.
Hit the showers, then go home.
You're supposed to see the principal.
Don't say anything to Dad.
- Alright.
Come in.
Come in, Theo.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
Tea?
Sure.
Have a seat.
Sit.
Sugar?
- Please.
How are you?
Fine.
And your family as well?
They're fine, too.
Great. And your dad?
He's fine, too.
He works hard, doesn't he?
Oh, yes.
You know, Theo,
I once did menial labor, too.
As a farmhand.
I'd have remained a blue-collar worker,
just like your dad.
You'd have been one, too.
But our comrades gave people like me
the chance to become "new teachers"
and head wonderful schools
like this one.
Socialism isn't perfect yet.
But it's good.
It's good for us.
You probably want to know why...
- No, I don't.
I don't want to know anything.
I just want to sit
and have tea with a student
from a similar background
who gets to graduate next year.
You're not some small-minded,
stuck-up prig.
You're someone who knows
that for the first time,
the working class has a real chance.
It's a historical chance, a future.
And we don't want to spoil that.
You'll get your diploma next year, Theo.
And then the future is yours.
If a student has nothing to say so close
to graduation, that's not so bad.
But if the whole class
has nothing to say for two minutes?
If everyone is silent?
That's odd, Theo.
It's hard to believe, isn't it?
There has to be an explanation.
Yes.
We need an explanation.
Farmers say,
"If the earthworm starts
to burrow in fall,
brace for winter storms, one and all."
And a clever farmer
prepares for a storm.
Good night, Theo.
Good night, Principal Schwarz.
The situation
in the Hungarian capital, Budapest,
seems to be growing increasingly clear.
After mass demonstrations
for freedom of speech, free elections
and more independence
from the Soviet Union,
opposition leader Imre Nagy
named his new government today
and officially recognized
the revolution.
The Soviet Union announced its intention
to withdraw its troops from Hungary.
Russian troops
have already handed over control
of Budapest to the new government.
The Russians are pulling out.
- They did it!
I can't believe it!
Hey, Theo, have you heard?
What's going on?
Theo, they did it.
The Russians are going.
Hungary has a new government.
It's time to dance, guys!
Reason enough to celebrate.
To the freedom of nations.
To freedom.
Yes!
What?
- I want to show you something.
Theo?
Sorry. We're about to leave.
No, wait. Hold on.
Tell everyone to wait.
I have something to discuss.
Wait, guys.
Hold on a sec.
Go back inside, please.
I had a very strange conversation
with Principal Schwarz.
What did he say?
He was saying that something is brewing.
Something about a worm in fall
and a coming storm.
What?
- I forget exactly what.
But his message was clear: They're going
to look into our moment of silence.
What?
He's worried about his job.
He said it could cost us our diplomas.
How's that?
Because a moment of silence is
a disagreeable act of political protest.
Whatever the case may be...
I thought it over and have a solution.
If they ask us why we were silent,
we'll say it was because Puskás died.
Who?
- The soccer player.
Ferenc Puskás.
- Yeah.
We were remembering an idol
out of a love of sport,
not political conviction.
Simple.
- But that's not true.
No, it's an excuse.
But otherwise, there'll be trouble.
So we should say we're apolitical?
- Exactly.
The Russians are leaving.
The Hungarians won.
The whole thing is over.
We need an excuse.
I don't want to give an excuse.
Lena is right, we can't use Puskás
as an excuse. It'd be a lie.
What good is a revolution
if it's only in our minds?
"Revolution?"
Listen, can we take it down a notch?
Sometimes you've got to roll
with the punches.
Theo's right.
This could mean big-time trouble.
- So what?
May I ask a question?
Why do you need high school diplomas?
I mean, you...
You seem to have big plans.
So why do you need
to get a fancy high-school diploma?
I assume
it's because you don't want to spend
all day working on an agricultural co-op
like your parents.
That's not it.
I believe in socialism.
That's good.
You have to believe in something.
Otherwise there's no point.
Believe in socialism,
in capitalism or even in the monarchy.
Whatever you like.
What counts
is that everyone adheres to the thinking
of a given system.
Well, you didn't do that.
You did something else
with your show of solidarity
with the Hungarians.
You revealed yourselves
to be freethinkers.
And no system likes that.
The individual must conform,
or there will be anarchy.
It's an idea I'm not averse to,
but that's irrelevant now.
Have you understood
what I'm trying to tell you?
Right...
You're now enemies of the state.
What?
- Nonsense.
Yes, you're enemies of the state.
Because you thought for yourselves
and acted upon those thoughts.
And I do believe your principal
is right when he says
there's a storm brewing.
Fine, I suggest we vote on it.
Who's for an excuse, and who wants
to stick by our show of solidarity?
No, Kurt.
Let's vote by secret ballot.
Yes, that's better.
We had enough trouble with Erik.
NO
The majority is for the cover-up lie.
Come on, Kurty.
Do you have another cigarette?
Yes.
My last one.
Thanks.
Can we split it?
Really do it.
- Go on, Kurt. You're angry, too.
Let it out!
We have another problem.
We have to get Erik on board.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.
Is Erik home?
- Yes. He'll be glad you dropped by.
Erik!
What are you doing here?
Cut it out, man. Seriously.
The Russians are leaving Hungary.
Says who?
RIAS.
Were you at Edgar's again?
That fairy likes having
you boys lounging around.
Come on.
Enough of that, Erik.
Schwarz said
they're going to investigate.
Well, of course.
We all plan on saying the moment
of silence was only in memory of Puskás.
So...
apolitical.
Yes.
Do you see it that way too, Kurt?
Majority rule.
If you support it,
I'm sure everyone else will.
That's not an answer.
Are you in favor of it?
No, I'm against it.
But I'll go along with it.
Well?
Yes, I'm in.
Friendship.
- Friendship.
Everyone copy Chapter 3.
Lena, go see the principal.
Now, Lena.
Come in.
Friendship.
Good morning, Lena.
Sit down, please.
Comrade Kessler from the district
school board has some questions.
It's about the moment of silence you
held in history class a few days ago.
Why were you silent?
We thought...
Well...
Pardon me, Lena.
We don't know each other.
Just so you know,
a healthy spirit of opposition
is always welcome in our schools.
I simply want to understand
why you were silent.
Because Puskás died.
Pardon me?
Puskás.
A soccer player.
Because Puskás died.
We heard he died
in the Hungarian revolt.
We were sad.
He's a role model.
So you're saying
that you made a fool out
of your teacher,
because you're soccer fans?
Yes.
Well, that's a whole another story.
Erik,
you're supposed to see the principal.
The district school-board chairwoman.
Theo.
You're supposed
to bring the class register.
Where do you sit, Theo?
So your silence was in memory
of the fallen Hungarians?
Just to mourn Puskás.
You know, the Major.
Match of the century, '53.
6-3 against England. Rematch 7-1.
So there was no political reason?
It wasn't political. Not at all.
How did it come about?
It came out of a group discussion.
I don't know whose idea it was.
Erik says you started it.
That can't be.
A class full of sports fans.
You'll be glad to hear
that Ferenc Puskás is not dead.
He's alive?
FERENC PUSKÁS ALIVE.
Yes.
It was a false report from RIAS.
Western propaganda.
I can't help but wonder where and why
you were listening to enemy radio.
We weren't.
It was just being talked about.
Just great.
Erik.
What nonsense did you tell them?
What?
Ringel said
you told them I was behind it.
They're trying to pit us
against each other.
So you didn't say I was the ringleader?
- No.
You're sure?
Do you think I'm lying?
You or Ringel.
- Sit down.
This is a problem.
For all of us.
It's a big problem.
Comrade Kessler is writing a report.
There's no telling
where this business will lead.
Come on. Listening to enemy radio
so close to graduation?
May I say something?
Ringel's not treating us fairly.
He's twisting our words.
And he's pitting us against each other.
I forbid such baseless accusations.
Baseless?
You heard him say Erik betrayed me.
Yes.
- Yes, and did I?
No.
I...
- Those are Gestapo methods.
Gestapo?
Do you have any idea how men like
Ringel and I fought against fascism?
You're out of line, Theo!
You're an ungrateful bunch!
You're unworthy of the privilege
of attending this school!
Today, the entire graduating class
is receiving a warning.
Theo Lemke,
I hereby give you an official reprimand.
You've shown yourself
to be especially disobedient.
The reprimand
will be noted on your diploma.
One more reprimand,
and Theo won't graduate.
There won't be any more incidents.
I promise you.
I do have one request, Comrade Schwarz.
Can we take Theo out of school
for the day tomorrow?
Sure.
Read this aloud.
Not you, her.
I don't have my glasses.
- Then take mine.
"Counter-revolutionary mobs
wreaked great havoc
and plunged Hungary
into dreadful chaos last week.
Austrian journalist Bruno Frei
describes the events..."
Stop.
An Austrian, mind you.
An observer from the West. Continue.
"The city's leadership has changed twice
over the last few days.
The insurgents had set up headquarters
in the tavern formerly frequented
by the Arrow Cross Party..."
Stop.
The Arrow Cross Party.
The fascist, anti-Semitic party
in Hungary till 1945.
Continue.
Continue.
Read on.
"21 members of the Communist Party,
whom the insurgents took prisoner
when they stormed the building,
were hanged in the square
outside the building in broad daylight."
So, my dear boy.
Hungary is in chaos.
The Russians are the only ones stopping
that chaos from spreading all over.
The West is full of fascists,
all the way up to Adenauer's government.
You think
you're on the right side, Kurt.
Showing solidarity
with the "freedom fighters."
But you're in league with the fascists.
Maybe you're more like
your mother's father
than I'd like to believe.
It's fine here.
Hermann, break's over.
Get back to work.
Theo.
You're the first man in our family...
- I know...
Don't interrupt.
Sorry, Father.
You're the first man in our family
who's able to go to a good school.
The first.
All of the others were killed in wars.
Or spent their whole lives
toiling in mines or power plants.
Or as steelworkers, like me.
But you're smart, Theo.
Clever, like Grandpa Hans.
What?
I'm clever, too.
Of course you are, smarty pants.
Yes.
This is RIAS Berlin.
A free voice of the free world.
- Has everyone else left?
The revolution can't take place.
The students are tired.
The government
led by Imre Nagy announced
the country is leaving the Warsaw Pact.
The Russians are retaliating brutally.
- No.
A tank division
has attacked the capital, Budapest.
But the brave, undaunted Hungarians
are again taking up arms
and defending their newfound freedom.
From the radio building in Budapest
we received this...
'SOS.
Peoples of the world, march onward
and extend us a brotherly hand.
Save us."'
The damn Russians sent in tanks again.
There must be something we can do.
- We can't be the only ones who care.
Maybe the Americans will intervene.
- Certainly not.
We can't.
What?
Oh my God.
I thought it prudent not to inform
Principal Schwarz you were coming.
Comrade Education Minister,
what an unexpected honor.
May I introduce myself?
I'm Principal Schwarz.
I had a report from Comrade Ringel,
and since I happened to be nearby,
I thought I'd drop by.
If we'd known you were coming,
we'd have prepared a proper reception.
From whom?
The counter-revolutionaries?
Theo, last night at Edgar's...
What?
They're screwing around on you.
You're nuts, Paul.
- Good morning, Paul.
What's with him?
Friendship.
- Friendship.
Good morning.
We have a visitor.
Education Minister Lange
is here with us today.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
You can go now.
I see astonished faces.
Who among you is surprised by my visit?
No one?
I see.
Then you've obviously realized
attempting a counter-revolution
is no laughing matter.
Counter-revolution?
Or did you think
the whole thing would be over
after the reprimand given to...
Theo?
Did you think that was it?
Yes, Theo, you heard correctly.
This is a counter-revolution, and
I'll find out who the ringleaders are.
What do you know about the Gestapo?
Is that a rhetorical question?
So your father is Hermann Lemke?
He has inside information.
Quiet.
I'm a communist.
I know the enemy of the people well.
I've crossed paths with him in combat.
I will not sit by and watch
as the enemy of the people
tries to undermine socialism.
Or, put more simply,
if you're against socialism,
I'll punch you in the face.
What profession do you hope to have?
- Movie director.
Oh. An artist.
No, I want to make sports movies.
Oh, yes.
This is a class of the GDR's
ultimate sports enthusiasts.
And I see that you believe in God.
Do you believe in God?
Yes.
Do you believe
in the Immaculate Conception?
Do you believe that Mary
conceived her child as a virgin?
Yes.
Do you believe
in the freedom of the working class?
Leave my sister alone.
- Silence!
You're the daughters of Winkler,
the veterinarian, right?
Veterinarians are the worst.
Always taking the shirts off
farmers' backs and gorging themselves.
Like ministers.
Who said that?
There's no doubt that your show
of sympathy for the Hungarians
has to be classified
as a counter-revolution.
I demand the names
of the ringleaders within a week.
If I don't get them,
no one in this class
will be allowed to get a diploma
anywhere in the GDR.
What?
Comrade Kessler will continue
questioning you this coming week.
If you do not break your silence,
she will shut down this class
at the end of the week.
You can go now.
You can go now and think about
how this matter will be resolved.
Erik Babinsky, please remain here.
The rest of you can go.
Please have a seat.
I have a report from Comrade
Kessler's initial investigation.
According to this,
you're the ringleader.
Me?
- Yes.
You gave the incident a name.
You said, and I quote:
"It's a sign of protest."
Or didn't you?
- I did.
I just said that to explain it
to our teacher. I wasn't taking part.
Oh.
So you weren't the ringleader at all?
No.
I'm most definitely not the...
Don't you know who my father was?
Franz Babinsky.
The Red Front fighter?
- That's right.
He was in a concentration camp, right?
He died for socialism.
I'd never join a counter-revolution.
Your report is very misleading, Comrade.
Very misleading.
I apologize, Mr. Minister.
But if you weren't part of it,
I'd like to know
why you told Comrade Kessler
you were also silent because of Puskás.
And I'd like to know
why you, a staunch socialist,
listen to RIAS.
I didn't...
Stop there.
We'll do this differently.
You can prove to me
you're a credit to your father's name.
First, I'd like to know
where exactly it is that the lot of you
listen to RIAS.
At Edgar's...
That is...
I was never there, but the others...
They go to an old queer named Edgar.
Check it out.
It has a 2.3-liter engine.
Erik.
Stop for a second, Erik.
What did old-man minister want?
Do you think this is a joke?
- No, it's a counter-revolution.
Did you betray us, Erik?
No, Kurt. I didn't.
You can keep hiding
behind your classmates.
What?
Someone will tell eventually,
or we'll all get thrown out of school.
Nonsense.
- No, Erik's right.
The moment of silence was my idea.
I got you into this. I'll admit to it.
- No.
That's good, Kurt.
- Shut up. You voted to do it, too.
No, I didn't.
You were at Edgar's.
If Kurt admits to it,
he'll get thrown out.
How sweet. See, Theo?
- Shut it.
But they're screwing around on you.
- I said shut your trap.
Go ahead and put your neck on the line.
It won't do any good.
They'll ask:
"Who else listened to RIAS?"
"Where did you listen?"
They'll want to know everything.
They won't just let you go.
If we stick together,
there's nothing they can do.
They won't kick out a whole class.
How would that look?
Maybe it's better if I tell the truth.
You get on my nerves with your "truth."
Everyone sticks with the cover-up lie.
Or there'll be an uproar.
Theo, wait up.
- No, Kurt. Leave me alone.
I don't know what Paul said, but...
- But?
Take her, Kurt.
I'm seeing someone else as it is.
The minister himself, right?
He'll evaluate
the matter independently.
Oh, come on. Stop.
"Independently."
You don't honestly believe that.
How does the minister
know your name, Dad?
I want to know who's dumb idea
this moment of silence was.
I'm not going to betray anyone.
Don't try that with me, pal.
You're going to tell me right now
who instigated this whole business.
Now, damn it!
It was Kurt's idea, but we voted on it.
The majority voted yes.
The majority.
Kurt.
If it really was Kurt's idea...
then he has to answer for it.
Wait until the last moment.
I don't care.
If by then no one has...
you tell them it was Kurt.
I'm supposed to betray my best friend?
Do we have an understanding?
Mom, you two can't really want that.
Go to your room.
Sorry for making things tense.
What's a moment of silence, anyway?
And why does it
get you into so much trouble?
Good question. Beats me.
Can we talk?
- Of course. About what?
Can you come outside?
- No.
But I have something of yours.
Don't get too excited, now.
It's fake.
I glued it together. Right, Karl?
A real four-leaf clover
really is a very rare thing.
I'm sorry if I've upset you.
But I can't be with someone
who always makes excuses.
Knock-knock.
Excuse me.
We knocked.
I'm Ms. Kessler,
the district school-board chairwoman.
Is it true that the graduating class
listens to RIAS here?
...to our much-loved tea dance.
We'll open with a boogie-woogie tune.
And Jesus said, "Truly, I tell you,
one of you will betray me."
We just heard
that from the Gospel of Mark.
But what if, that night...
You rotten bastard.
Paul.
You betrayed him, you swine.
They've taken him away!
They've taken Edgar away!
RED FRONT FIGHTERS' LEAGUE
Is there anything
you want to tell us, Erik?
Please sit up
when your father talks to you.
My father.
Is it true you testified that Edgar
made his radio available to the class?
How should I know
why they arrested that fairy?
If that's so,
you have to retract your statement.
Homosexual men
have it bad in our prisons.
Erik.
Very, very bad.
- Please say you had no hand in it.
Your father's right.
- He's not my father!
That was my father, and you were
too weak to stay faithful to him!
SEAMSTRESS'S WORKSHOP
I'll walk you there.
- What?
No, no. Don't bother.
I've been finding my way to the bar
since before you were born.
And when you leave one day,
I'll have to find it myself again.
Fine,
but I'll stay up till you get back.
I want to know
what happens at the meeting.
Things are never as bad as they seem.
Everyone, please settle down.
Please settle down.
Please.
There's no point whatsoever
in discussing every single detail
of our letter to the minister.
It's far more important
to reply as quickly
as we can to protect our children.
We have to include
the school administration.
It's a reply from the parents.
- Yes, but...
Okay.
The minister will see you now.
Thank you.
Comrade Lemke.
Comrade Minister.
Thank you for taking the time to see me.
Have a seat.
What can I do for you?
It's about
the students from Stalinstadt.
Yes, Theo is your son.
I'm informed.
Yes, of course.
Look, it's all just a stupid prank
some kids pulled.
Theo is a good student.
And he's certainly not
a counter-revolutionary.
He staunchly believes socialism
is the only way into the future.
And he loves soccer.
The boys, they love soccer.
Is that why you've come here?
To tell me platitudes?
Do you see this?
That's where a couple of SA men
tried to hang me from a wire.
You'll understand
my utter disinterest in soccer.
I want the ringleaders.
I'll make sure they don't get diplomas.
I just don't know
if your son is one of them.
Most definitely not.
Would you say
Theo's character is similar to yours?
I would say
there are similarities and differences.
He's obviously just as...
dissatisfied...
as you are.
We haven't forgotten
you took part in the uprising in '53.
But I conformed.
Then let's hope that your son
follows your example.
Theo...
- Silence.
Sit down.
Theo Lemke.
Is everything okay?
Please sit at your desk.
Who told you
about the moment of silence?
I don't know, it...
- ...was passed down the rows. I know.
Your father took part
in the workers' uprising in '53.
Oh.
You didn't know that?
Still, he was given the chance
to start over again here in Stalinstadt.
He was given a secure livelihood for
your whole family, your siblings, too.
They're still very young.
You shouldn't put that at risk, Theo.
No.
Who were the ringleaders?
It was passed down the rows.
Lena.
Theo.
- Kurt.
Your mother lives in Sweden, correct?
Yes.
Your grandmother,
who is a seamstress for the cooperative,
has poor vision
and is on her own?
Yes, Comrade Kessler.
If you want her to keep her job, tell me
who's leading the counter-revolution.
No one.
It was passed down the rows.
I've now listened
to all of your classmates' lies, Erik.
Who is the ringleader?
It was a majority decision.
It's very simple.
I just need one name.
One.
Who is it?
It wasn't one person,
it was passed down the rows.
I'm tired, Erik.
We'll make this quick.
I have a file here
on your father, Franz.
I'm afraid your mother didn't tell you
the whole truth about him.
Which I can understand.
She lied to you.
He was a Red Front fighter, that's true.
That's why he was sent
to the camp in Sachsenhausen.
But he collaborated with the Nazis
and betrayed other communists.
And when the Russians arrived...
he was hanged.
That...
TRAITOR
TRAITOR
You have two options, Erik.
Either you tell me whose idea it was,
or we'll publish the story about
your father in the paper next week.
It was...
It was Kurt.
Kurt?
It was his idea.
Are you absolutely certain?
You're accusing
the city council chairman's son.
You'll repeat that in front of the class
when the ultimatum expires.
You can go.
Oh, Erik.
Go ahead and take that picture with you.
It will remind you
that you did the right thing.
Aim better.
You're late, Comrade Babinsky.
Late yet again.
Kurt.
What's wrong?
- I...
And now you want to chat?
What happened?
Take up your shooting post. Erik!
Yes, sir, Untersturmbannführer!
Erik.
Put the weapon down, boy.
- You goddamn filthy Nazi!
What happened?
Put down the gun, Erik.
He's not worth it.
Not that guy.
You'll regret this,
you good-for-nothing.
Sit him down.
Where's he going with that gun?
Erik.
Erik, stop!
Erik!
Erik!
How did my father die?
Erik.
What is this?
Put the gun down.
You stay out of this!
What is this?
- How did my father die?
I don't know what you mean.
Get back, kids!
They're coming. They'll shoot you.
How did my father die?
Mom...
- Erik, please.
How did my father die?
- Erik, I don't know what you mean.
Did you lie to me, Mom?
Was my father a collaborator?
What is this?
Yes, what is it?
- Christa.
Christa, tell him the truth.
What?
Erik...
It's true... He...
Erik, your father was very weak.
No!
Erik, I'm sorry.
Why?
Erik, I couldn't...
- Why?
Mom, why?
Why?
Why?
I betrayed you.
They would have published
the story about my father in the paper.
About mine...
and yours.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Thank you.
Kurt.
We'd like to speak to you, Kurt.
Sit down, please.
Sit down, please, Kurt.
Erik claimed
the moment of silence was your idea.
All we have on record to date is this:
Erik gave the incident a name.
He called it a sign of protest.
I'm taking your father's
political office
into consideration and will therefore
call on you first in class tomorrow,
and you will say
Erik was the ringleader
of the counter-revolution.
The class won't go along with that.
I won't bother asking the class.
I'll end the investigation
after your statement.
I'm giving you this opportunity.
Erik is going to prison
for at least ten years as it is.
See you tomorrow.
I'll walk you out.
Thank you.
Should I make you tea?
I have to ask you something.
Sit down, please.
How important is the truth to you?
The truth.
I asked Mother.
You have to choose
the lesser evil, Kurt.
Say it was Erik. He'll do time anyway.
Then it'll be over.
Be glad Kessler
is giving you this chance.
Mom?
Stop asking your mother!
That's an order,
and you'll obey!
You have your whole life
ahead of you, Kurt.
You won't ruin your future
over something like this.
It's a white lie, that's all.
One I'll have to carry with me
my whole life.
What? In ten years, in two,
you'll laugh about it.
Why would I ever laugh about it?
Did you laugh
when you hanged Erik's father?
He was a collaborator.
How is that relevant?
Did you betray him to the Russians?
Go to bed now, Kurt.
Tomorrow is an important day for you.
Why won't you say anything, Mom?
Leave here and don't come back.
I love you so much.
I'll always think of you.
Every day.
Every minute.
But you have to leave now.
Okay?
Tonight.
The boys are asleep.
Can you come outside?
Theo... what's going on?
Go back to sleep, Karl.
What is it?
I'm going to the West to get my diploma.
What?
They want me to pin it all on Erik.
They're just calling on me.
But I won't play along.
If you go,
it'll be like an admission of guilt.
At least everyone else
can get their diplomas.
And we both know it was my idea.
It's best this way.
I just came because I thought...
Well, I thought...
maybe you'd come to the West with me.
Me? No.
I can't do that.
Because I betrayed our friendship?
- Come on, Kurt.
Stop making everything such a big deal.
I can't leave my family alone.
I can't do that to my parents.
I would really miss my siblings, too.
Then make sure this all ends well.
The others should get their diplomas.
Will you see to that?
Yes.
Are you cycling there?
To Königs-Wusterhausen.
I'll get the first train tomorrow.
One more thing.
I couldn't say bye to Lena. Tell her...
- Tell her what?
Oh, nothing.
Kurty. Kurty.
Kurty. Kurt.
Good luck.
Take care, Theo.
Anna.
He's gone.
My son is gone.
Anna. Anna!
Kurt's gone.
Anna!
I know.
...to the American sector.
Please have your ID ready.
Morning.
Papers, please.
Where are you headed?
Südstern.
To visit my grandfather's grave.
Is that your bag?
- Yes.
Open it.
School things?
I'm taking my final exams soon.
At your grandfather's grave?
No, I wanted to study on the train.
Come with me.
Sit down.
Your son claimed
he was taking the train to the West
to visit his grandfather's grave
in the war cemetery.
Yes, he does that now and then.
What was your grandpa's rank?
My father-in-law
was an infantryman in the Waffen SS.
So you knew your son
was traveling into the American sector
to visit the grave
of a National Socialist?
His grandfather's grave. Yes.
He'll return today. I'll give you
that in writing, if you wish.
Good.
Then you can go.
Father, you can't do that...
- Mother expects you home for dinner.
Yes, Father.
See you later.
Then sign here, Comrade.
Bye, boys.
- Bye, Theo.
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Theo.
- Bye.
The big day, huh?
Don't play the hero, Theo.
No, of course not.
I'm proud of you.
Stand up!
Friendship.
- Friendship.
Sit down.
As you know,
the National Education Minister
asked me
to identify the ringleaders by today.
According to the way things look,
Kurt Wächter
has as good as admitted his guilt.
As his parents just informed us,
Kurt has fled the country.
What?
The minister would like class
to return to normal.
However, it is imperative
that each and every one of you,
right here and right now,
confirm that Kurt
orchestrated the moment of silence.
Theo.
Can you confirm that Kurt led you
to observe a moment of silence?
No, that's not how it was.
That's not how it was?
How was it then?
We were all in favor of doing it.
At least the majority was.
And you?
Were you for or against it?
I was for it.
Right.
Then I hereby expel you from school.
You're kidding.
You will never get a diploma
in the German Democratic Republic.
Every academic path is closed to you.
You are to leave
this building immediately.
Now.
That's not right...
- You're expelled, too.
Expelled.
It was my idea.
Sit.
And mine.
It was my idea, too.
Sit back down in your seats.
Mine too.
And mine.
- All of you, sit down.
It was my idea as well.
- I said sit down!
I was in favor of it, too.
Me too.
It was my idea, too.
- Sit!
Mine too.
- And mine.
I said sit down!
Mine too.
- And mine.
You are all to sit down!
I hereby expel
the entire class from this school.
We will not tolerate such behavior here.
- Comrade...
You'll have to answer for this, too.
Principal Schwarz.
And how did this help the Hungarians?
It didn't.
It didn't help them one bit.
What do we do now, Theo?
We've each got to decide that
for ourselves.
All right, come here.
A lot of people visit family in the West
between Christmas and New Year.
Controls aren't as strict.
- That'll never work.
It's our chance.
Everyone has to decide for themselves.
We have to leave everything behind us.
But if you go, then in pairs,
so one of you can tell the parents
if you get caught.
But how?
How do we do it?
- Friends, acquaintances, relatives...
Well, I can't imagine
anything worse than that.
My parents...
We should go now.
It's better than staying here.
Bye.
- Take care.
Bye.
So?
Do we run away or do we stay?
Like I said,
everyone has to decide for themselves.
Okay.
Take care, sunshine.
Good night, Theo.
- Sleep well, Karl.
Thanks for the ball.
Well.
Then that's just how it is.
You'll start at the steel mill
in January.
Why didn't you ever tell me
about the uprising?
You took part in '53, didn't you?
I'm not staying here, Dad.
I'm going to the West to get my diploma.
You'll go to jail if they catch you.
You'd never be able to come back.
- You could join me.
We can all go.
- What? Run away and be proud of it?
That's nonsense.
Good night.
You don't know him well,
if you think he'd run off.
Never.
He'll never leave here.
Why not?
What is there here?
Really, what?
Nothing. There's nothing here.
He's from here.
This is where he was born, and...
He's not going to leave.
He hardly talks to me anymore.
- He's just sad.
I still remember the day you were born
as if it were yesterday...
Let's go, boys.
Grandma is anxious to see you.
Theo, come on.
- Let's do it.
Theo.
Theo.
Theo, let's go.
I'm going with Paul.
- Bye, Theo. See you later.
We'll get all the cookies.
And the goose.
Theo, come on.
Bye, boys.
- Bye.
Bye.
Mom?
What's wrong, Dad?
- Nothing. We're going.
Bye, Theo.
See you later.
Attention: The train from Stalinstadt to
Berlin leaves shortly from Platform 1,
with stops in Frankfurt
and Fürstenwalde.
NEARLY ALL THE STUDENTS LEFT
BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR 1956
AND GOT DIPLOMAS IN WEST GERMANY.
FOUR STAYED.
SILENT REVOLUTION
