Sports photographer ?

photographer
We do fruit, cheese and,
you know, yogurts and stuff
Oh
It's highly exciting
Yeah
Have you done
much of this, then ?
Um, yeah, I mean,
one day, I got this--
this, um,
this girl ringing me up telling me
she was a rock star
No
Yeah, and she was,
like, real stoned
She was, like,
"Hi, I'm with this band"
She started telling me about
her life as a rock star
and how interesting
it is and, you know,
if I wanted to be with her,
I'd have to kind of make
compensation 'cause she'd be
on tour a lot, you know
Were-- Were you
really adopted ?
Yeah
Oh, 'cause I-I used to pretend
I was an orphan
I'd, you know, pretend our house
was the orphanage,
and, um, my sisters
and my little brother,
they were orphans
from other families
I really wanted
to believe it, yeah
Yeah, I know,
it's strange
Yeah
Yeah Cheers
Cheers
I'll see you tomorrow ?
Yeah, all right
Okay, bye
See you
Bye, then
Yeah
Here for a copy
of the Big Issue
Big Issue
Here for a copy
of the Big Issue
Hello, Eileen
Hello
You're looking smart
Where have you been ?
Just to my daughter, Molly
Oh, God !
Cut it out, you lot
I hate those fucking things
You all right ?
Yeah
Our front door
needs fixing
I'm getting 'round
to it
That's the Sony CD 1 7 00
Right What are you
asking for this ?
That's 1 99 plus VAT
Plus VAT
Which works out to 23 5
Can I have a look ?
See you tomorrow,
Harvey
All right
See you later, mate
Strong cappuccino,
one and a half, take it away
Hello Can I help you ?
Is it eat in ?
Take away ?
You give me the pound, and
I'll give you the change
Yeah ? Yeah
You give me a pound, and
I give you 40 pence change
Salt beef and,
uh, cappuccino
All right
That's three pound,
please
Thank you
All right, first of all, don't get--
don't get angry with me
This is not
gonna look good
This might not
look good at first
And I know this is not
the best of time-- No
We're both responsible
adults, right ?
I care about this baby
we're having
Yeah
I care about this baby
we're having
And I realize that there are
certain financial advantages
in having a job
I'm aware of that
I am aware of that
Think of the drawbacks of holding
onto a job that you hate
Think of what
that could do to a man
Think of what I could
and would become--
short-tempered father
I turn to drink
I blame you
Eventually,
I even take a lover
And then one day, I just snap
Finally, just snap
I buy a gun
I'll lock myself into the house
with you and the kids
Police surround us, begging me to be
reasonable, but--
No
No, it's too late
It's too late
Another statistic
A news item
A news item
in The News of the World
Whoo !
Yea !
Things can be
even more tricky for a male
if his mate is well armed
The female tarantula
has fearsome poison fangs
Aren't you gonna
do something ?
What do you
want me to do ?
Doesn't it bother you ?
Of course it bothers you, but you're
too pathetic to do anything about it
Pathetic
Only now dare he reach
forward with his palps
What do you mean,
"pathetic"?
Who's pathetic ?
You're the one
who's fucking pathetic !
Male spiders are by
no means always so skillful
These few legs are all that remains of
a male nephila spider who failed
But another male is on the same web
now preparing to chance his luck
And his task is indeed formidable,
for his mate is gigantic--
six inches across and several
hundred times his weight
She's virtually blind, and
she relies on vibrations of her web
to tell her what's going on
Hi
You all right ?
Can't sleep
Why not ?
What's wrong ?
Dunno
Just can't sleep
Well, you shouldn't be reading
What is it ?
A new game
Gonna ask Dad to buy it
for my birthday
What's this
girl's name again ?
Lara Croft
Do you like her, then ?
She's all right
Yeah ?
Not very good, are you ?
No Well, I've got
to practice, haven't I ?
Get some rest
What are you doing tomorrow ?
- Going to the football match
with my dad
- That'll be nice
You'll need all the rest
you can get, then
Put your head down
Give us a kiss, darling
'Night
See you in the morning
Yeah Do you want
this world left on ?
Yeah
All right
Sleep tight, darling
Good night
Night-night

Why'd you
bring me here ?
This is where I work
I take it that's where you work,
unless you broke in
I mean, most people have houses,
don't they ?
They go to what is a bed,
rather than some--
I've got a big bed
Have you got a big bed ?
Why don't you show me your big bed ?
No I've got
a little boy
You've got
a little boy ?

He's fucking little
How little ?

Gimme a cup of coffee
You spill
your coffee on me,

I haven't had any sleep
I didn't hear anything
That's 'cause

the whole fucking night
I haven't had any sleep
If Molly phones,
you're to tell me--
I know Don't worry
You'll be the first to know

Why ?
Oh, I don't feel sexy at all
Just feel fat

When's the last time

Dunno
Couple of months
Couple of months ?
For God's sake, Molly
Darling, I'm pregnant
Did you feel sexy

Yeah, really sexy
Did you ?
I loved it
I loved having big tits
Did you do it right up till the end?
Yeah
Felt really gorgeous
all the time
Did you have weird dreams
when you were pregnant ?
No
I've been having the weirdest dreams,
like nightmares almost
Nightmares ?
Yeah, I had this really
weird one last night
I was-- Well, I dreamt that I was
at home, and I went into labor
And so, we're gonna go
to the hospital,
but we didn't actually go to
the hospital, we went to a theater
Do you mean a stage ?
Yeah, like where they
do plays and things
Yeah
I thought it was a bit
weird but all right
And we went in onto the stage
and there was a bed on the stage,
and the midwife
was there and everything
Eddie was on the bed,
was he ?
Eddie-- I dunno
I can't remember
if he was there then
Was he naked ?
Shut up
But I looked out
into the audience,
and it was all my kids out there from
my class from last year, yeah
It was--
It was weird, but--
Anyway, and then I gave birth
to a fish, right on the stage
Eh ?
I know
Isn't that weird ?
Everybody in the dream
thought it was really strange
It's fucking weird,
Molly
But I still loved it
Jackie ?
What's that, mate ?
Molly said she had sex
with a fish last night
That is not
what I said
Jackie, Jackie, that's not what I said
She's lying
No, I had a dream that
I gave birth to a fish
Well, that ain't normal, is it ?
I know, it's weird
It's not normal at all
It's fucking weird
It's gotta mean something,
though, isn't it ?
Yeah
It means she's a horny bugger
Shut up
Talked to Nadia lately ?
Yeah She was asking about you Yeah
Was she ?
I think she's jealous of me
Jealous of what, Molly ?

I'm only asking
Jesus, it's not
an odd question to ask
I haven't seen you for ages
What happened to him ?
Why do you always try

It's better than trying
not to be funny, isn't it ?
Don't be putting your coat on
That's not polite, is it ?
I'm not staying
Why ? Why ?

Hi Hi
Let's listen to the prophets
that God rises up,
as we are shown
through their messages
our sins, our shortcomings
And so we thank God for not
leaving us in our slumber,
but awakening us, awakening us
to our true condition
And yet, the messages
of the prophets
are not all doom and gloom
