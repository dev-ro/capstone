The drivers are all on the grid now, and
the Monaco Grand Prix is about to start.
There's Scott Stoddard
with his Jordan BRM.
And with him now, is Jeff Jordan himself,
talking to this brilliant English driver...
... who's won so many races
in the dark-green BRMs.
Even faster than Stoddard in practice,
was the Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Sarti.
Twice world champion, an absolute master
of these twisting Monte Carlo streets...
... he's won the Grand Prix here
three times.
He drives for the great Italian manufacturer,
Ferrari.
His teammate is the Sicilian, Nino Barlini,
who's also won a place on the front row.
Barlini's the former world champion
motorcyclist...
... who made a very successful switch
to car racing last year...
... and is certainly a potential
world champion in Formula 1 racing.
On the second row, is Pete Aron,
the American, now driving for BRM.
Pete hasn't won a Grand Prix since
he left Ferrari three seasons ago.
But in spite of two bad accidents last year,
he's still just as fast as ever.
Yesterday he lapped only a tenth slower
than Scott Stoddard...
... number one driver in the BRM team.
Let's try and get the season
off to a good start. Shall we?
Drive the car, don't try
to stand it on its bloody ear.
Tim Randolph, another American, driving
a Japanese Yamura, also on the second row.
This team's only been in Formula 1 racing
for two years...
... and so far the car's not been
reliable enough to win a Grand Prix.
But the Japanese have
the most powerful engines of all.
Ten seconds.
Five...
...four...
...three...
...two, one.
Go!
Ste. Devote,
then Sarti in the lead.
From Stoddard, Aron, Hulme,
Anderson and Randolph.
Stoddard's drawing level with Sarti
up the hill. He's going to overtake him.
Now, it's Sarti in the red Ferrari,
number 17 leading...
... past the Hotel de Paris
and into the Casino Square.
Along the seafront, at the tobacconist...
... it's Sarti's red Ferrari ahead of
Stoddard's green BRM number 12.
As they finish the first lap, it's Sarti first,
Stoddard second, Aron third...
... and fourth now
is Barlini's Ferrari, number 16.
I used to think nothing
could be better than motorbike racing.
Three times I'm awarded champion
on my motorbike. I'm happy.
Then I go into one of these...
These cars... You sit in a box, a coffin.
Gasoline all around you.
It is like being inside a bomb.
Crazy.
But, of course, the cars are faster.
And that is the most important thing.
You have to remember that at Monte Carlo,
because of the nature of the circuit...
...you shift gears over 2600 times
during the race.
That's an average of once
every three seconds.
No reason to expect gearbox trouble.
On the other hand, potential problems
are in the back of your mind all the time.
I've driven this course six times before...
...the way I see it, I've only got
three big problems today, and that's:
Two Ferraris starting ahead of me
and my own teammate, Scott Stoddard.
Walking the course is just about the last
thing I'd do on the morning of a race.
It's become a bit of a thing with me.
I do a lot of thinking...
... collecting my thoughts about how I'll
run the race, all that sort of thing.
Of course, it originated with my brother,
Roger. He used to do the same thing.
As a matter of fact, before I started racing
I often used walk the course with him.
The funny thing about Roger,
you know...
...the day he was killed, he hadn't walked
the circuit for some reason or another.
I suppose I'm rather superstitious
about that.
I love the challenge of Monaco.
Driving through ordinary streets full out,
is to me what racing is all about.
It's a pity it's the only one
left of its kind.
At the end of 10 laps the order is still
Sarti, Stoddard, Aron and Barlini.
Stoddard can't quite squeeze his BRM
past Sarti's Ferrari.
There's very little room to pass
on these narrow Monte Carlo streets.
Barlini and the other Ferraris
can't quite...
- Oh, my darling. You're not ready?
- Ready? For what?
Pat, you've forgotten.
Hugo, the way I feel now...
...if I could remember my own name,
I'd consider myself very fortunate.
- What have I forgotten?
- Last night.
I told you I'd be by to take you
to the winner's circle...
...if Scott wins.
- Hugo, there's lots of time.
The dungarees.
Hugo, have you ever had ouzo?
I have had everything, my dear.
I was with two Greeks last night
and we drank ouzo. A lot of ouzo.
And where, may I ask,
was your husband...
...while all this Greek
and ouzo business was going on?
Where he always is the night before a race:
Trying to sleep.
The danger? Well, of course.
But you are missing
a very important point.
I think, if any of us imagined,
really imagined...
...what it would be like to go into a tree
at 150 miles an hour...
...we would probably never get
into the cars at all. None of us.
So it has always seemed to me,
that to do something very dangerous...
...requires a certain
absence of imagination.
Number 17, the Ferrari of Jean-Pierre Sarti,
is still in front...
... but he just cannot get away from
number 12, Scott Stoddard in the BRM.
And the second BRM driver, number 11,
Pete Aron, is only three seconds behind...
... with Nino Barlini in number 16
Ferrari breathing down his neck.
That's 25 laps gone.
One-quarter of the race distance.
As Sarti and Stoddard fight for the lead,
they're leaving Aron and Barlini behind.
Stoddard's pressing Sarti. The Frenchman's
usually unbeatable at Monaco...
... but today the Englishman is faster
on some parts of the circuit.
Now that Stoddard's out in the lead,
his lap times are faster and faster.
And he's going steadily away from Sarti.
There doesn't seem to be anything
the Ferrari driver can do about it.
There's Scott Stoddard completing his
30th lap and increasing his lead over Sarti.
But there's the third man, Barlini,
in his red Ferrari now well-clear of Aron.
And he's just lapping a slower car.
That can be tricky here at Monte Carlo.
It's almost impossible to pass...
... unless you can rely on the driver in the
slower car to move over and make room.
That's 32 laps completed and the order is
Stoddard, Sarti, Barlini, Randolph, Aron.
- Get back out there.
- It's sticking in between third and fourth.
It didn't do it in practice.
Do you suppose it could be you?
All right, I'm doing it on purpose.
On purpose or not,
you're breaking her up.
- I didn't build the damn car.
- We can't do anything about it.
- Do the best you can.
- What lap is this?
- Forty-two.
- It's a cinch. I'm halfway home.
You're never halfway home!
Pete Aron's away again.
He's had some sort of gearbox trouble.
There's Stoddard now. He'll lap
his BRM teammate, Aron, next time round.
Stoddard's driving a tremendous race.
Bet he's broken the lap record again: 129.3.
Blimey, they nearly collided
at the Gasometer hairpin. That was close.
Louis Chiron's waving
the blue flag at the American...
... which means he ought to move over
and let the faster car through.
Let Scott through!
The bloody idiot.
Sarti's picked up three seconds.
You can't blame Pete
for wanting to race.
Not with a teammate!
He has to let him through!
Barlini in second place at the Gasometer
as Sarti completes 50 laps...
...half distance in the lead.
- That's my driver. Let go. Let me through.
- Damn you! Damn you!
- Get these people out of here!
- I waved him through.
- Where are the cops?
- You're a bloody liar.
- Please, Jeff.
I told you to take it easy with him.
- Apart from being a bloody coward!
- Jeff, don't.
- Shut up! You're a liar!
- Now, get these people out of here!
Shut up.
Look, you're through with me!
Now, just get out of my sight
as quick as you can!
Something's happened.
There has been an accident.
That's what they come for:
See someone get killed.
- How did it happen?
- A bloody lot you care.
- Don't say that. Don't speak to me like...
- Mrs. Stoddard.
You can stay here if you want.
It will be some time in surgery.
You've got what you want now.
He's finished with driving.
Maybe we'll have some peace
in our lives now.
You think so?
How I didn't spin out
is a miracle of skill and daring.
What do you think of this man?
In the middle of the race
he decided to take a swim.
It cost me two seconds.
From the manager.
Hey, Jean-Pierre.
You should fix that.
I have something in my room.
I just talked to the hospital.
- He's alive?
- Yeah.
Jordan says I was blocking.
Said I didn't give him a signal to pass.
- Did you?
- Of course I did.
The gearbox froze coming out of the tunnel
and I waved him through.
Got on the brakes, locked up,
and threw me in front of him.
Next thing I knew,
I was in the Mediterranean.
What are you going to do now?
I don't know. Gotta get a ride for the rest
of the season. I don't know where.
Pete?
Do you ever get tired?
Of the driving?
No.
Lately, I sometimes get very tired.
You know what I mean?
Very tired.
All right, unhook it.
Jeff is wrong, isn't he, Scott?
He says you're finished.
But you're not finished, are you?
I know, Scott.
Better than Jeff, better than anyone.
If I told them you'd drive again,
they'd think I was crazy.
They'll think you're crazy
when you tell them.
But you will, won't you, Scott?
You're in pieces now,
but it won't change anything for you.
You'll pull yourself together
and get back in the car somehow.
And for what?
To be better than Roger.
To compete against a dead man.
They don't know anything about that,
do they, Scott?
Not like I know.
They don't know it wasn't Pete Aron
in that car today...
...it was Roger you were trying to beat.
Roger's in every car you try to pass.
Well...
...this time, I'm the one that's finished.
No more for me, Scott.
I won't be there next time.
No more for me.
Please.
- Madame. Madame.
- Let me through.
Will he drive again?
Leave it.
Come on, will he be flown back to London?
Leave it.
I don't need your help.
You bastard.
- Agreement. Really.
- Yes, sir.
Then we can accuse Aron
of being ungentlemanly.
But not of breaking the rules.
- Oh, excuse me.
- I still don't agree.
At last. I began to think
you were not coming.
I'm afraid I got lost.
You need only have followed the crowd.
I wish I had known.
I've only myself to blame.
I invited them all.
First, a drink.
And then I will introduce you to some
people who will be able to help you.
Of course, you must tell me more about
the sort of things you'll be doing.
All in a day's work, Hugo.
This is work, huh?
It looks so easy.
I'd like you to meet
Miss Louise Frederickson.
This is Jean-Pierre Sarti.
Jean-Pierre, it was a wonderful race.
Fantastic.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
She...
She's an American journalist,
so be careful what you say, huh?
Would you believe it?
Once, a boy off the streets...
...and now he speaks to kings.
Anyone can speak to kings, Hugo.
But will they speak back?
But if they do, what will they say?
Oh, you see must see my museum.
- Something that might interest you.
- Museum?
- Yes. It's a...
- Jean-Pierre?
- Marvelous, Jean-Pierre.
- Thank you.
- Simply marvelous.
- Thank you.
Your first nine. Hugo, you've got
to come to settle an argument...
...about the 1932 Targa Florio.
He's the only one old enough
to have been there.
Now, there is a dubious distinction.
Was an excellent race you did today.
Well done.
- Thank you, Bob. Thank you very much.
- Very good.
Suppose I show you the museum?
Obviously, if I don't escape from here,
we'll never get past "hello."
Come to think of it,
we haven't even managed that yet.
Now...
...hello.
- Hello.
- What did she mean, "your first nine"?
- Points.
Toward the Drivers' World Championship.
Have you known Hugo very long?
Since yesterday.
Someone in New York
gave me his name.
He's offered me his influence.
Which I gather is quite extensive.
Influence? For what?
Well, I work for an
American fashion magazine.
We're going to do
an issue around racing cars.
Yes! Now, I have it.
Of course.
Louise Frederickson.
You once did an article about my wife,
Monique Delvaux.
"One of the 27 best-dressed
business women in the world."
Something like that.
Only 10.
You were away at the time, as I recall.
Yes. "While..."
"While her husband is off
racing motor cars...
...this busy woman executive
spends long evenings in her office...
...administering the complex affairs
of the Delvaux Motor Company."
I remember that part quite well.
It had about it the slight hint
of feminine prejudice...
...toward the footloose male.
It wasn't meant to sound that way.
Is your wife here tonight?
She never comes to the races.
Charming, isn't it?
I can use this.
It's interesting.
Do you like motor racing?
I don't know.
I had never seen a race before today.
- What are these?
- Autographs.
People in motor racing.
Where are you?
Over there somewhere.
Are you going
to the palace party tonight?
I wasn't invited.
I invite you.
There are a lot of parties tonight,
aren't there?
Yes.
- Is that the usual thing after a race?
- Of course.
And I can assure you...
...that if you don't come
to the palace party tonight with me...
...you will be missed.
And this man Stoddard,
will he be missed too?
I don't understand.
- Do you know Stoddard?
- No.
But I find it difficult to understand
how this sort of thing can be going on.
The celebrations.
When a man lies in a hospital,
possibly crippled for life.
If he were dead,
it would be the same.
More subdued perhaps, but the same.
And apparently it doesn't
affect you at all. None of you.
I'm sorry.
I guess that was all very rude of me.
Before you leave,
I want to tell you something.
Not about the others.
But about myself.
I used to go to pieces.
I'd see an accident like that
and feel so weak inside...
...that I wanted to quit.
To stop the car and walk away.
I could hardly make myself go past it.
But I'm older now.
When I see something really horrible,
I put my foot down.
Hard.
Because I know
that everyone else is lifting his.
What a terrible way to win.
No, there is no terrible way to win.
There is only winning.
Hello, Nino.
Nino!
Nino!
Dance?
I don't dance.
Have a drink with me.
I don't drink.
- Smoke?
- I don't smoke.
What do you do?
So you let Stoddard lap you.
You're still getting yourself
into hopeless situations.
It wasn't hopeless to begin with,
it just turned out that way.
There's a difference.
But you didn't come all the way to Modena,
to talk about Scott Stoddard. Did you?
I wanna drive for you again,
Signor Manetta.
Aron, your last season with me...
...you did nothing but tell me
what was wrong with our cars.
Then you left us, to follow hopes
that lasted a season.
Then to Jordan,
now back to me.
You confuse me, Aron.
And I don't like men
who confuse me driving my cars.
I left you because I didn't want
to become second driver to Sarti.
A position you put me in.
And now?
I need a ride.
I won a lot of races for you.
Of course you did.
Before you became reckless.
- I want to be champion.
- Everyone wants to be a champion, Aron.
There is no distinction in that.
I can be.
At what cost? And to whom?
All right.
I'll drive for you for less than
I was getting on my old contract.
I'll pay my own expenses.
You take the starting money.
I'll just take my share of the prizes.
I'm not talking about money, Aron.
Of course, I would not appreciate
your doing to me...
...what you did to Jordan at Monaco.
To have two cars wiped out,
at a cost of $100,000 apiece...
...is an unhappy experience.
But I could afford that.
I could not be in this business
if I weren't able to afford that.
It's one of the risks I take
every time a car leaves the starting grid.
But what is a greater risk, Aron...
...what means far more to me
than anything else is a good name.
Our reputation represents desire
for perfection of the highest quality.
I gamble that reputation gladly.
Because I have
absolute faith in every car...
...that leaves this factory.
But I will not risk it in a driver...
...in whom I cannot have an equal faith.
There are fewer than 30 men in the world,
qualified to drive Formula 1.
A mere half-dozen, perhaps, to win.
At this moment, I'm inclined to think
you're not one of them.
Tough luck, Scott.
- Hello. How are you? All right?
- Jeff, how are you?
Is it true that doctors strongly advise
against moving Scott?
No, the decision to come home was Scott's.
He felt with English doctors he'd probably...
What about next season?
Scott, will you be ready to drive?
He's ready to drive now.
I just don't happen to have
a car for him at the moment.
All right, let's get him in.
- Hey, Jeff.
- Yeah?
What about these rumors of a divorce
between Scott and Pat?
- Absolute nonsense.
- I know, but we've heard...
Now, look, Mrs. Stoddard is taking
an enforced vacation under doctor's orders.
You know neither heaven nor earth
could keep her from Scott's side.
- She's just on this holiday.
- All right.
- Okay. Thanks.
- Good luck.
- Where is she?
- Forget her.
- Where is she, Jeff?
- I don't know.
I want her back, you know.
You're a fool, then.
Jeff, you've never understood her.
I know you think she's frivolous,
incapable of any kind of understanding.
But you're wrong.
It's just that she hates what I do.
I think she still loves me, you know.
Hard as that may be for you to understand.
Trouble is, she's got to persuade
herself that she doesn't.
I worry about what she might do...
...trying to convince herself of that.
- Fine. Thank you, David. Where's Tina?
- Tina! Tina!
Tina?
Hey, Pat? In the car.
- How am I doing?
- You're doing beautifully.
- I look all right?
- You look fine. Now, just stop worrying.
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.
I expected you to be back
in America by now.
Oh, no. We'll be doing this
the entire season. I thought you knew.
No, no.
Does Guido know about all this?
Of course.
Arrangements were made.
Well, I can't say I'm not properly dressed
for the occasion.
I should be wearing
something fashionable.
Well, your driver's suit isn't bad.
Maybe you could start a new style.
Spun-glass, form-fitting,
waterproof, flameproof.
What's Pat doing here?
Oh, she asked for a job
and I was able to give her one.
She's very good.
- Hello, Pat.
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.
You're looking very chic in my car.
- How's Scott?
- I don't know.
- Arrangements were made.
- They told me arrangements were made.
Guido.
They mean no harm.
So far, Sarti has
the fastest practice time.
If nobody goes any faster this afternoon,
the Ferrari will be in pole position...
... for tomorrow's French Grand Prix.
Sarti's time was 3 minutes,
11. 1 seconds.
95. 1 miles an hour.
This Clermont Ferrand circuit is just...
- How do you feel?
- Like an idiot.
Don't look so glum.
It's an honorable profession.
- You'd rather be dogcatcher or something?
- Or something.
- He's doing well.
- He could do better.
A slave driver, this one.
This looks very complicated.
At first glance.
It's only a different way to tell time.
More precise.
Well, I'm afraid I don't understand
any of this.
- Not any of it?
- No.
I mean, for one thing, it looks to me
as though the spectators...
...can't really see very much of the race.
True enough, I suppose.
Jean-Pierre, andiamo!
And the risks you take.
Aren't they ridiculous?
I might understand it if you
made a great deal of money...
...but I'm told you don't at all.
Some of us do. But money
is not an important part of it.
- Then what is?
- Many things.
It's marvelous to go very fast.
Why is it so marvelous to go very fast?
Answer that one, Lisa.
- Hello, Chris.
- Hi, Pete.
- Jean-Pierre. How are you?
- Hey!
- How are you, Pete?
- All right.
Hey, Nino.
The cars aren't good enough
for him anymore.
Interview me first, Pete.
I have had a fascinating life.
- I might as well.
- World should know.
I wouldn't want people
to think I was unemployed.
I was a born a poor boy
in Cerda, Sicily. Nothing to eat.
- Not a crumb of bread in the house.
- I guess Manetta told you...
...I came looking for a job.
- Every year, I would...
Well, I think he should've found you one.
Cerda is right on the course
of the great Targa Florio race.
- Knock it off, will you?
- Knock it off? What's that?
It means: You would be
well-advised to cease.
Yes.
"Knock it off."
I like that.
We're pleased to announce the arrival...
... of the famous Japanese industrialist,
Mr. Izo Yamura.
He's been racing Formula 1 cars
for more than two years now.
But this is his first visit
to a Grand Prix circuit.
We're delighted to welcome him
to Clermont Ferrand.
This might be something to get, Pete.
Well, you care to come watch my debut?
- Hello, Tim.
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello again.
- Pete, how are you?
Mr. Yamura? My name is Pete Aron.
Mr. Yamura wishes you to know that he,
of course, recognizes from photographs...
...the well-known Mr. Aron.
Although he was at first
somewhat confused...
...to find you in your present occupation.
He also offers his regrets in regard
to your unfortunate accident at Monaco.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.
I was wondering if Mr. Yamura
would consent to doing an interview?
Mr. Yamura regrets
he does not give interviews.
Well, I'm sorry. Thank you,
thank you very much, sir.
- See you, Tim.
- See you later, Pete.
Well, I'm off to a flying start.
- Well, there's always Nino.
- Yeah. There's always Nino.
He was born in Cerda, Sicily, you know.
Not a crumb of bread in the house.
But he always knew that someday,
someday a poor guy, you know.
Of course there's no trouble
between Scott and me.
I've simply resumed my career.
Well, one of my careers.
Mostly at Scott's urging,
I might add.
It would hardly be a proper motor
racing season...
... without the Stoddard name connected
to it in some way, would it, Pat?
Considering what the Stoddards have been
to the sport in the past few years.
Needless to say, I'm present in a far more
humble capacity than Scott would be.
I'm delighted to be able to represent
the name for the rest of this season.
Pat, when did you last talk to Scott?
Can you give us some idea
of how he's coming along?
Oh, we talk two or three times a day.
He's coming along beautifully.
And he wants everyone to know
how very grateful he is for all the hun...
That interview concludes
this broadcast from Clemont Ferrand.
Tomorrow at 3:00,
there will be a live transmission...
...of the start of the French Grand Prix.
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.
- Hello.
Hello. Pete.
You were fine.
That was beautiful, Pat.
Really beautiful.
Particularly the part about representing
the Stoddard name?
That was especially good.
You'll have to be careful, though.
If Scott gets a load of that kind of thing,
he's liable to recover very quickly.
You'll be out of a career again.
You're very superior, Mr. Aron.
For the man to put Scott Stoddard
where he is.
Scott put Scott where he is.
That was a perfectly appalling thing,
what he said to that girl.
He may have done it badly,
but he isn't altogether wrong, you know.
The Stoddards don't exactly have
what one would call a fairy-tale marriage.
- Well, that's their business, isn't it?
- Not if she chooses...
...to discuss it
in front of a television camera.
Now, would you care for some lunch?
Nino seems to have enough there
for all of us.
That's what comes
of a poverty-stricken childhood.
This girl has died from over-timing.
Enough food. I need the sun.
The sun it will be.
Sun, food and sex.
It's hard to think of them
10 years from now.
Fat and married.
With five fat children.
Maybe.
Maybe they'll avoid it.
The marriage or the fat?
Both.
You don't believe in marriage?
It depends on whose marriage it is.
- I apologize for that.
- Why?
Because it was bad manners.
What does it matter to you
what I do or don't do?
A girl has to make a living.
Last time a girl said that to me,
she was stepping out of her skirt...
...and asking for a hundred-dollar bill.
- Making a comparison?
When did you last talk to Scott?
- At Monaco.
- That's sweet.
Why are we being so offensive?
Probably because
we don't like each other.
Speak for yourself.
Now, you see?
The object is to put the fly exactly
where you want it to be.
Well, what difference does it make?
It's a big lake.
The difference is the art of it.
We could wade out and hit the fish
over the head...
...but there would be no art in that,
would there? Now...
Now, is that where you
wanted it to land?
Would I admit to anything else?
Where was I?
You began racing
because of your marriage.
Yeah.
When we got married,
Monique and I...
...Delvaux had just started competition
and I began testing cars.
The next step, of course, was racing.
Delvaux stopped racing some years ago.
But I kept on.
Why?
Well, actually I think
I've begun to wonder myself.
But I suppose it doesn't really matter.
A man does what he does.
We do what we most want to do,
I suppose.
Now, you try.
Here, and here.
Hold it here.
This way. Here.
Where are the fish?
The fire is too high.
We must have a bed of embers.
We will have a bed of cold gray ashes
by the time you catch a fish.
Have faith, Nino.
I tell you, there are fish.
Now, very gently.
Come on. Now.
- Very good.
- There.
Is that a good place for it to be?
Doesn't really matter.
It's a big lake.
Hey! My stomach refuses to accept
your promises any longer.
If there were some beefsteak,
I would cook you meat...
...in the style of the Auvergne.
- An excellent idea.
There is no beefsteak.
We will have fish.
In the house, hidden behind the cheese...
...in the cooler: Beefsteak.
We will save some for you
because there are no fish in this lake.
Go away, Nino!
You are too close!
Why aren't you married?
Well, it's not a very subtle question, is it?
I need all my subtlety for the trout.
How do you know I'm not married?
I have noted the unmarried
woman's brave air of independence...
...mingled with vague longing.
Independence, maybe.
Vague longing. I wasn't aware of that.
Something perhaps
only a man would see.
Or imagine.
Well, no vague longing, then?
But not too much
independence either, I hope.
Very bad for a woman
to be too independent.
Very bad for whom?
I like to be free.
I like traveling.
I like making my own decisions.
Meeting new people, working.
I like to be free.
I was married once.
But he was in love
with someone else.
You going to win tomorrow?
Probably.
Could we declare a truce long enough
for you to buy me a drink?
Sure.
I'll have one of those.
Well, Sarti did it again.
Yeah, he drove a good race.
How do you like your new job?
It's what I've always wanted to do.
You know, I've known you for, what?
Two and a half years.
And all I know about you
is that you drive cars.
That's all anyone knows
so far as I can tell.
You've just written my biography.
"The Silent and Secretive Pete Aron."
"Inside Pete Aron."
"What's Pete Aron Really Like?"
It will never sell.
Will you give me a lift back to the hotel?
I'll never understand
why none of you...
...get this sort of thing out
of your systems on the track.
We all drive like maniacs.
I've left Scott, you know.
Really.
Yes, I know.
You've got a great sense of timing.
You think I should be at his bedside,
nursing him back to health and vigor?
I guess I'm just
an old-fashioned boy at heart.
You don't understand.
I left him because he won't quit.
He won't stop racing.
And I couldn't take it anymore.
I couldn't stand it.
You know what he does
the night before a race?
He lies in bed and sweats.
But then, you wouldn't know
what that would be like for a woman.
To live with that.
Will you go back to America
when you are finished with your click-click?
Yes, of course.
You couldn't be persuaded
to remain in Europe?
My life is in America.
What is your life?
What is it?
I never thought about that, I suppose.
Well, think about it.
Friends...
...work.
That's my life.
My friends and my work.
Well, one needs those.
But what do you need now?
Nothing.
Liar.
Come with me, Louise.
- Where?
- To a place I have in Monza.
I have to go there to test a new car.
There are two weeks before
the Belgium Grand Prix.
We could leave tonight after the party.
Come with me.
And your wife?
We share nothing
but our business interests.
Nothing.
What do you think we would share?
More than that.
A bed?
More than that.
With luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
- Why do you all do that?
- Do what?
Wear your sunglasses on top of your head?
- I don't know.
- It looks ridiculous.
I guess you're going to the party tonight.
- No. You?
- No.
What are you going to do about dinner?
- How many guesses do I get?
- Nine.
- Guesses?
- O'clock.
Mr. Yamura?
Mr. Yamura, I got your message.
Your message.
Yes, I was hoping
it would reach you in time.
Well, I thought...
Well, you do speak English.
Yes, but not for the press.
I hope you will forgive me.
That's quite all right.
There have been times when I wish I'd been
able to pull something like that myself.
I gather, then, that you didn't ask me
here as a reporter?
Will you join me in some tea?
Some years ago,
when I decided to race cars...
...I tried to buy
the Jordan-BRM Company.
Oh, yes. I had heard that.
Impatience on my part.
I also manufacture radios
and sewing machines.
In order to save time,
I wanted a proven product.
That was not to be, however.
Racing cars are not merely
another product.
They require great attention.
If any success is to be hoped for.
Than that's why you're here.
I have been racing my car
in Formula 1 for two years.
And have yet to win my first Grand Prix.
I intend to win by whatever means
are open to me.
That's the right attitude.
All you have to do is go fast enough
and long enough.
And with the best drivers.
Do you want a job with me?
- Driving?
- Driving, of course.
- Who are you dumping?
- Dumping?
Oh, which one of your drivers
are you getting rid of?
Neither one.
I am entering a third car.
- That will be expensive.
- Yes.
You've got a driver.
My racing headquarters
is at Silverstone in England.
- Can you be there next week?
- Yes, sir.
We must begin to think about Spa.
- Next week, then.
- By the way, you are a terrible broadcaster.
Mr. Aron.
If giving you the job
would have meant firing...
...one of the other drivers,
would you still have taken it?
Good.
- Is it true what you said about Scott?
- What?
About not being able to sleep
the night before a race?
A man like that
should be in some other line of work.
I'll bet you sleep like a baby.
I'm divorcing him.
Are you?
Why tell me?
Well, because I don't think
you were entirely joking...
...when you said you're
an old-fashioned boy at heart.
And old-fashioned boys
have old-fashioned scruples.
- About what?
- About other people's wives.
I don't follow you.
Like hell you don't.
Good night.
- Memo?
- Jean-Pierre.
Memo, good to see you.
I would like you to meet Miss Frederickson.
How do you do?
Yes, there's luggage in the car.
Rafael?
Come, I'll show you around.
The only member of this club?
The only one
who keeps an apartment here.
In fact, I have the only apartment.
"Jean-Pierre Sarti,
World Champion, 1961."
It's so quiet.
Appreciate it while you can.
At Grand Prix time,
crowds, excitement, noise. Terrible.
- Care to drink?
- No.
Are you very tired?
No.
To health, wealth and happiness.
You are very greedy.
No.
Hopeful.
There are seven more races.
Yes, seven.
And then?
Do you want to think that far?
No.
Good.
Now I feel marvelous.
Marvelous.
And you?
Yes.
Smile for the cameras.
Come.
As you can see,
we work day and night here...
...to get the car ready.
I'll take your word for it.
We must immediately mold
the cockpit for you.
Yes, sir.
All right? Or too long?
- I like what you've done here.
- Thank you.
I was afraid it might have offended.
Offended? How?
My not adapting to your ways.
No, not at all, sir.
I promise you, if I'm ever in Japan
and I entertain you for dinner...
...you'll get a fork.
Fair enough.
Right after the war...
...my house in Tokyo was used
by an American general and his family.
When it was returned to me...
...it had flowered wallpaper...
...three new bathrooms
and four new closets.
Americans, I think,
are over-devoted...
...to bathrooms and closets.
Well, we accumulate things.
And then you lock them away in closets.
And the bathrooms?
No, no. You don't get me on that one.
- Were you in the war?
- Yes. And you?
No, I missed it by a year.
In the war, I was a fighter pilot.
I shot down 17 American planes.
- Okay.
- I believe...
...that some things
must not be left unsaid.
There will come a time...
...when you will ask yourself:
"What did he do in the war?
This man, Yamura?"
- Mr. Yamura, I like you.
- Why?
Well, because...
- Because you come right to the point.
- In a sense...
...you're here because you drive a car...
...the way I conduct my business.
You come right to the point.
- Hello, Mrs. Stoddard. Nice to see you.
- Jeff.
- Scott.
- That's okay, just get me the crutches.
- All right, come here.
- Hello, Mother.
- It's good to have you home.
- How are you? The place looks terrific.
Thanks. Hello.
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.
Gates, come and shake my hand.
- How are you?
- Terrific, thank you.
Come along in.
Careful there, it's slippery.
Can you manage all right?
I'll get Thompson to bring lunch
to your room.
- I'll eat downstairs.
- You can't go downstairs again.
I'm getting up the stairs,
I can certainly get down them again.
If worse comes to the worse,
I can always slide down the banisters.
- Right?
- Yes.
- You'll stay for lunch, Jeff?
- I'd love to.
I should've thought you'd have
cleared this lot out long ago.
- Why?
- Roger's dead.
It's just too bloody morbid.
- Where are your own things?
- I don't know.
Around somewhere.
Of course, they're nothing compared
to this lot.
Something to shoot for, old boy.
You gotta have something to shoot for.
- Okay, you can say what you're thinking.
- What am I thinking?
That I haven't got all this
to shoot for anymore.
But you're wrong, you know.
Quite wrong.
What really scares me, here at Spa,
is driving into a cloudburst.
You're doing 160 in the dry...
...then you're suddenly driving
into a wall of rain.
Can't even see the car in front.
Just like trying to swim underwater
in the dark.
Please, Bob, in a moment.
The point is, gentlemen...
...the road condition on the approach
to the S's before Stavalo...
...have not been improved over last year.
If anything, they're worse.
I don't see how they could
possibly be worse than last year.
- Let's write them a letter.
- They file letters.
A strongly-worded letter,
official, from the Driver Association.
They have a special file
for strongly-worded letters...
...from the association.
- We gonna talk about calling the race off...
...in the event of rain?
- No, no.
Please, Ritchie,
one thing at a time.
The subject is road condition.
They haven't changed the road
in 10 years. They not liable to do it.
We know you're taking your life
in your hands driving in the rain.
- When are we gonna do something?
- A letter demanding that the road...
...be paved.
- They can't pave the road by tomorrow.
- What's the point in talking about it?
- We talk about this business of rain...
...every year. It's damn well time
we did something.
Well, let's demand to cancel it, if it rains.
You can't cancel this race.
- Or postpone it.
- You can't even postpone it.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
What about the flag marshaling?
Hey, look who's here.
It's Scott.
Find out which room they're in.
- Don't be foolish...
- Come on, man, find out.
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?
How are you?
Hooray! Hooray!
- Hey, Scott.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Hey, Scott.
How are you?
How are you?
Is that you, Pete?
Better be.
Meeting over?
Scott's here.
What?
We'd better have a talk.
What do you wanna talk about, Pete?
May I?
Really, Scott, this isn't
in very good taste.
