Hyah.
We're behind schedule.
[Horse Whinnies]
[Spanish]
[Whinnies]
[Whinnies, Snorts]
Hold it right here.
[Man] Is a good thing
you didn't tell us this is
where you wanted to come.
Why is that, toad boy?
Because we wouldn't have.
This place is dangerous.
There's a legend.
Four hundred years ago,
a ship stopped near here
and left behind a treasure.
Must be a big treasure for someone
to go to the end of the Earth to hide it.
And for some gringo to go
just as far to dig it up. Huh?
You're a smart boy, Miguel.
[Flies Buzzing]
And because of that,
I'm gonna let you have
some of what we find.
Ah, remember
you say that.
Oh, I will.
I'm gonna let it have
a little of you too.
Right about here.
Tell your men to start
diggin' right here.
The opening
to the cavern's about two
or three feet down.
A cavern?
Thas what the Indians say.
The men who came buried
the treasure in a cavern.
[Spanish]
[Men Digging]
[Pulley Squeaking]
You know,
this thing doesn't look
like a treasure chest, huh?
Looks more
like a casket.
[Men Chattering,
Spanish]
You're right again, amigo.
And inside it is the most
incredible treasure
in the whole world.
[Laughing]
[Gringo]
Cut the straps.
Come on.
Open it up.
- [Men Gasp]
- [Gasping] What the fuck!
Boys, meet Lilith.
Thas it?
Thas your
goddamn treasure?
You bet it is.
This here is the most horrible woman
the world has ever known.
And she's all mine.
You sick, pathetic,
little piece of shit.
You drag us all the way
to the end of the Earth
for a fucking stiff?
Vamonos.
This ain't no ordinary stiff,
my friends.
I've been looking for this
little lady for ten long years.
I've searched the four
corners of the Earth...
just
to find her heart...
so I could give it back
to her.
[Chuckling]
[Heart Beating]
[Laughing Wickedly]
- [Continues Laughing]
- [Heart Beating]
[Heartbeat Continues]
Ahh.
[Miguel, Spanish]
H-How are you doing that?
What can I say, boys?
I know how
to turn a woman on.
- [Chuckles]
- [Heart Stops]
Damn.
Thas not supposed to happen.
Wake up!
Wake up, you bitch. Shit.
Wrap her up.
We're taking herwith us.
You sick
piece of shit.
[Gasping]
[Man]
Efe! Efe, mira aqul!
Ahora! Aqul está!
- [Gasps]
- [Miguel] My God, blood. Blood.
[Blood Dripping]
[Spanish]
[All Gasping]
Ay, madrecita.
[Men Gasping]
[Miguel Gasps]
Oh, mama.
- Wh-What is that?
- [Gringo] Is a vampire.
The mother of all vampires!
- [All Gasping]
- [Man Groaning]
[Gasping]
[Raspy Voice]
Come to me.
No! No!
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
Chill, baby.
[Growling]
[Continues
Growling]
- What is that?
- You don't get to the movies
too often, do ya?
- "Movies"?
- Is the only thing
that keeps her in line.
The blood inside gives
whoever possesses the key
total power over Lilith.
It doesn't matter
where the key is.
In a pocket.
In a safe.
[Chuckles]
- Or right in her face.
- [Hissing]
- Isn't that right, sweetheart?
- [Continues Hissing]
- Hey, beautiful,
if I give you one more,
- What are you doing?
- You promise to behave?
- Anything foryou, lover.
You son ofa bitch.
[Screaming]
Then she rips his face off,
and she eats him!
[Laughing]
I-I know. It-lt doesn't sound
like all that much,
but ill do
great business foreign.
And the cassette...
Believe me.
You know the last picture
that I directed made a fortune.
I don't need to tell you
what a piece of shit that was.
[Thinking]
No, you don't. I know
what a piece of shit it was.
Jack! Jack.
How are you?
Kudos to you, my friend,
on your promotion.
We must do lunch.
Must, must, must.
[Whispers]
What a schmuck that guy is.
When I was still acting
in motion pictures,
[Sighs]
I couldn't get him
to call me back.
Not a single
goddamn phone call!
Now, of course,
he'd give his left nut
to work with me.
[Thinking]
And I'd give my left nut
for this lunch to be over.
Which brings me to why
I've asked you here today.
You and I have been friends
for a long time.
[Sneezes "Bullshit"]
[Clears Throat] Yes, yes.
We have, haven't we?
Just as well
you feel that way...
because I don't think this tomb
is big enough for the both of us.
[Chuckling]
Which is why
I would like...
to propose
a friendly little competition.
Winner take all.
You're on, pal.
One.
Two.
- Three!
- My rock beats your scissors!
[Gasps]
Give me that hand.
[Chuckling]
[Laughing]
[Gasps]
[Cackling]
That didn't hurt one bit.
You ready for round two?
- Go for it!
- [Wheezing Laughter]
Well, kiddies,
looks like your pal the Crypt Keeper's
in for the fright ofhis life.
Um, I mean death.
Which is kind oflike the man
in tonighs tawdry tale.
He's about to meet
the ghoul ofhis dreams...
in a nasty bit
ofscarnal knowledge I call...
Bordello of Blood.
[Heart Beating]
[Man Over Headphones]

Yeah,
it probably would.
- Well, great.

[Shuts Off Music]
Thanks.
I was going out anyway.
Where are you going?
You're my sister,

A parole officer's
exactly what you need.
Fuck you.
Caleb, look, don't go out looking
for trouble, okay? Stay home. Please?
Are you afraid that I'm gonna go out
and have some fun, for Goïs sakes?
I know what it is.
You're afraid that maybe I'm

Ten fuckin' dollars.
You got it.

Look at it this way, pal.
At least they're paying

My kids are gonna

I wish you boys would
stop playing that game.
Is disgusting.
Why don't you just go out
and get yourselves laid?
Thas not a bad idea.
Louise, why don't you come over here
and give me a little piece
of what you got goin' on?
[Boys Laughing]
You're a little young
for me, honey.
Why don't you come back when you
grow some hairon your nuts,
and we'll talk about it.
Oh, my.
Why don't you come look at my nuts?
They're very nice.
Here's to getting laid, boys.
Sooner or later.
Here's to gettin' laid
sooner and later.
Boys, I know a place...
not too far from here...
where you can get the best
goddamn piece of ass...
in the whole
goddamn world.
They got girls
thall do things...

Why don't you get fucked?
I'm talkin' about

three days later.
Okay. Okay.
Sounds pretty intense.
All right, man?

Ask for the Cunningham...
wake!
You crazy,
bug-eyed motherfucker!

I'll kick your ass, man.
Can you believe this asshole?
He's insane, man.

Yo, Caleb.
Where you goin; man?
Where the fuck you think?
The Cunningham wake.

- You pussies comin' orwhat?
No. N-No!
What are you doin', man?
The guy's insane.

Thas what the guy said.
[Thunderclap]
[Thunder Rumbling]
You think there's a party
going on inside?
I don't know.
But if one member
of the Addams Family
opens the door, I'm outta here.
Come on, try again.
Hello.
Can I help you boys?
- Okay. We're outta here.
- I don't think so.
Here for the Cunningham wake,

[Thunder Rumbling]
[Man Laughing]
Excuse me.
Nice place. You got
about 10,000 termites
holding hands here?
[Chuckling]
I hope you boys
are ready to have fun.
Just the thought
of all that naked flesh
waiting foryou.
I'd join you myself,
but somebody has
to watch the door.
Been so busy tonight.
Yeah, looks like
a packed house to me.
Yeah.
[Man]
Come on, boys.
Keep up, keep up.
[Caleb]
This guy's pretty creepy.

Oh, my God.
Is a necrophiliac's

Come on, boys.
The girls are waiting.
[Chuckles]
Girls.
Girls.
Come on. Chop, chop.
In you go.
You want us to
get in the coffin?
Yes.
You're outta your mind,
old man.
Yeah.
We were gonna take you up,
but, uh, thanks,
we've changed our minds.
Changed your minds?
[Clicking Tongue]
I'm afraid this is
the only way out.
Come along, boys.
Get with the program.
The party is this way.
You heard the man.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Come, come.
Really.
I insist.
No, I insist.
Oh, man.
I don't like this.
Man, I must

Fuck.

Oh, thas a great start.
Oh, yeah. Um, do you want me

[Panting]
Okay.
You've got

Nice hair.
[Inhales]

'Cause I want to taste

Do you mind if I cut in?
Who are you?
The name's Lilith.

No.

And then I finish you off.

Okay.

Don't eat your heart out, baby.
Thas my job.

Wow, I guess I finally found a girl
with a little something extra.
[Both Sighing]
So, what are
your hobbies?
[Pants Unzip]
There's something
I need to ask you about. Um...
My girls know betterthan
to talk with their mouth full.
Whoa.
Two chicks. Thas cool.
[Chuckles]
You care for a little deep throat?
[Chuckles, Growls]
Deputy,
you don't understand.
My brother's been gone
for days.
Ma'am, I understand just fine.
Right now,
I'm up to my eyeballs
in missing persons.
I'll get
to your brother...
after I've gotten
to all these cases first.
I'm sorry.
That could
take forever.
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.
- Fucking cops are unbelievable.
- Great.
- Now thas just ridiculous.
A pretty lady like you
being treated like that.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help
overhearing.
My name is,
uh, Rafe Guttman,
Guttman Investigations.
I specialize
in missing persons.
Can I get that back?
I'm savin' trees.
Just doin' my part.
I have an office.
Maybe you and I
could go talk...
Watch what
you're doing, huh?
Rafe Guttman.
We could talk about this.
Unless you want
to stay here...
and let the A-Team get
to your brother's case.
I've had a few run-ins
with the cops myself, Miss...
I didn't catch your name.
Verdoux, Katherine.
Look, Mr. Guttman...
Call me Katherine.
I'm not sure that I'm ready
to hire someone right now.
What are you waiting for?
Every minute you delay,
is harder to find your brother.
You gotta trust me.
I'm an expert.
Well, I guess
it couldn't hurt to talk.
Of course it wouldn't.
And I'll be gentle.
And, you know,
I can't believe it,
but I'm actually
going to ask a woman this:
Uh, haven't I met you
somewhere before?
Must be my imagination.
Well, anyway, we're here.
And I know you're already
feeling a little bit better
about me, aren't you?
[Chuckling]
Why don't you plunk it down
right over there?
So tell me
about your brother.
We had a fight.
He went out,
and he never came back.
[Chuckling]
Thas one hell of a tiff.
That sort of stuff
happen all the time?
We argue a lot.
Then he goes out,
gets drunk with his friends,
and usually he comes home.
Yeah, not this time.
I'll tell ya what,
I'm gonna need the names
of those friends.
I'm gonna need some phone numbers,
some addresses.
Maybe a photo, charcoal rendering.
You got anything like that?
Yeah, I did bring
a picture with me.
- What are you lookin' at?
- [Laughs] Uh, your clutch.
I'm a purse freak.
I'm looking at you.
I swear to God I know you.
We've never met?
I don't think so.
Well, you know something, dearie,
if is any consolation to you,
you're just not my type.
That is comforting.
Believe me.
Can I get you something?
Maybe a cookie, popcorn,
a little Prozac, dear?
I'm fine.
So this is your brother.
Jesus Christ.
Wow. Same parents?
[Laughing]
- Can I keep this?
- Yeah, I suppose so.
I might have to wear this
in a locket.
How much is this gonna cost me?
A hundred and fifty a day,
plus expenses.
Now I know
I made a mistake.
No, come on.
Don't club me
with the dramatics.
I've got a half-price sale
this week on missing brothers.
How's that?
[Sighs]
Okay.
[Phone Rings]
One sec.
Hello. Guttman Investigations.
You've got Guttman.
What the fuck are you doing
calling me here?
For Chriss sake,
what do you want now?
You're reminding me why
being married to you drove me
to the brink ofhomosexuality.
I'm not hiding out on you.
Business has been dreck.
I don't care what
yourslimebag lawyersays,
I'm not holding out on you.
Don't you get it?
You cleaned me out.
You're a high colonic

What a sleaze.
I gotta go.
Fuck you.
Hey, where you goin'?
Somethin' spook you?
No, I'm fine. Don't worry.
I will pay you foryour time.
I don't want paid for my time.
I want paid for helping you.
Like it or not, Katherine,
I'm all you've got.
I'm gonna win this one
foryou, honey.
And you.
You just couldn't possibly

Listen, uh, you're Zeke,
aren't you?
I'm Zeke.
Zeke, I'm looking
foryour friend, Caleb.
You seen him?
I don't know anyone
named Caleb, Rafe.
You don't know shot selection either.
You really gonna do that?
You really thinking of that?
You're gonna pot the cue ball, man.
Why don't you go to hell.
Why don't I get out of the way
of the shrapnel.
Goddamn it!
[Rafe]
What did I tell ya?
Whas happening, Tonto?
[Laughing]
[Zeke]

Are you still here, man?
I'm still here,

I see you boys both

[Laughing]
Maybe you watch
a little too much QVC, huh?
Thas quick.
Fuck you.
[Laughing]
Consider me fucked.
Whas next on the shit shot
agenda here forZeke?
You cannot be serious.
Really, you should think about
putting the three in the...
[Zeke] Look.
- I don't know where Caleb is, all right?
- Uh-huh.
- Him and Reggie,
they went off to get laid.
- Long trip.
Why don't you get the fuck
outta my face, tiger?
I'm there foryou, Zekey.
What about you, Stephen Hawking?
You seen Caleb?
You seen his girlfriend?
[Chuckling]
He ain't got no girlfriend.
[Chuckling] No.
They went to a whorehouse.
Oh, you like whorehouses,
don't ya?
At this point in your life,
you're pretty much at peace
with having to pay for it.
Hey, you got an address
on that whorehouse?
Um, Bowmont, I think.
Bowmont?
You got a numberfor me?
Come on,
squeeze it out.
325.

You are making
such progress.
I'm gonna get Nurse Ratched

This is real cute.
I hate to break it up,
but I wanna play some pool here.
Shot number three.
[Zeke]
Uh-huh.

I'm telling you, man,

Oh!
Oh, asshole!
Jeez!
[Rafe]
Six-pack in the side cleavage.
You know what?
Step outside.
You know, Zeke,

Just not in the mood
for a blow job.
I gotta rock, kids.
Oh, Mrs. Johnson,
you were robust, vital.
Thas the Mrs. Johnson

Before the horrid ravaging

You got some figures for me?
Yes, I do.
For under $5 million, we can

Thas incredible, Katherine.
You're incredible.
Thank you.
Katherine.
Hi.
This is Rafe Guttman.
He's the man I hired...
to help me
find my brother.
Have you found him yet?
Sorry, Rev,
I'm on her dime, not yours.
Oh, I don't have any secrets
from J.C. Is fine.
Thas all right.
I got a ton of work
on my desk.
Good to meet you,
Mr. Gutten.
Well, he just radiates
a Christlike glow, doesn't he?
Nice place, Katherine.
Sort oflike Superman's
daïs joint on Krypton.
Mr. Guttman, have you
found my brotheryet?
[Clears Throat]
I haven't made contact,
but I did get a lead on him.
He and a friend ofhis evidently
went to a local whorehouse.
- Awhorehouse?
- A house inhabited by whores.
Okay. Well, I figured it
would be something like that.
Thank you foryourtime.
My checkbook's in my office.
I'll be right back.
You know,
I've not nearly finished
my investigation.
If thas where he is,
I'd rather not
know about it.
What is it with these religiosos
that makes 'em so uptight?
Thas a shame too
'cause she was hot.
Really hot.
As women of God go,
she was ungodly.
You could
always convert.
No, man.
That old-time religion
and sex just don't mix.
Unless, of course,
you're a Catholic priest.
[Snarls, Burps]
Sex.
You lookin' for sex?
[Chuckles]
Well, Hopalong
chimin' in over there.
I might be.
But throw a Bic lighter
on that burgerfirst.
Is still mooin'.
Didn't I see you

I know a place
not too far from here...
where you can get the best
goddamn piece of ass...
in the whole goddamn world.
They got girls thall do things
there aren't even names for.

You know, you make it sound
really enticing.
325 Bowmont.
Ask for the Cunningham wake.
[Belches]
All right. Thank you.
You loosen that headband, okay?
Oh, you look very lovely
tonight, Mrs. Factor.
We're going to have
some wild games tonight.
And I want you
to know something,
Mrs. Factor.
I'm very proud and happy
to have you on my slab.

Lovely perfume.
[Knocking]
Who is that?
[Knocking Continues]
- Yes?
- I'm here for the Cunningham wake.
I'm afraid the wake
is closed tonight.
Come back tomorrow.
I, uh, really must
pay my respects right now.
Then I suggest
you come back tomorrow.
Maybe you don't understand me.
- I'm feeling excruciatingly sad.
- I'm so sorry.
If I don't grieve right now,
maybe even grieve two or three times,
I'm gonna go out of my mind, okay?
I suggest that you go mourn...
somewhere in private
with a box oftissues.
[Lilith]
Myra. Such a pretty name.
We have a very different idea
about the profession here.
For us girls, isjust
a means to an end.
What else did Vincent tell you?
He told me that you took
good care of the girls...
and that you offer
some kind ofbenefits.
- Is that true?
- [Knocking]
Yes, we do have benefits,
ones you won't find anywhere else.
[Knocking Continues]
[Knocking Continues,

[Muttering]
There's never any peace.
[Young Man] Hi, I'm here...
The wake is closed tonight,
you little shit.
Come back tomorrow.
But... But l...
I'm coming to you,
Mrs. Factor.

McCutcheon.
McCutcheon?
[Coffin Lid Creaking]
[Sniffs]
[Sniffing]
Ooh! Deadly.
McCutcheon!
Wow. Hey, guys, lookin' for a scalpel
for a frienïs birthday present.
Seen a salesperson?
No? Okay.
Stealin'
from the dead, huh?
What the hell?
[Katherine]
So we have oursunrise
symbolizing faith...
and the dove
symbolizing good value.
Ofcourse, once we animate it,
the dove will appearto fly
straight into camera.
I like it.
Is simple, clean.
And tasteful.
Don't forget tasteful.
Sorry to disturb you,
but I have something
you should see.
I thought you said
Mr. Guttman had finished
his investigation.
He has finished.
Mr. Guttman...
Mr. Guttman...
your job is done.
Now, if you don't leave,
I'll be forced
to have you removed.
Fine. Katherine, you should
really take a look at that.
Take care, you two.
Mr. Guttman.
Yes, Miss Verdoux?
Where did you find this?
I found that
at the McCutcheon
Mortuary,
which also happens to be
the McCutcheon Brothel,
where young men
gather to get stiff
amongst the stiffs.
Unfortunately,
most of them end up getting
ripped off or even worse.
[Chuckling]
Why am I telling you that for?
Like you care.
Are you sure about this?
Maybe we should
call the police.
"We"?
Oh, I'm back
on the team now.
Christ, you're so nervous.
You gotta listen to me.
I'm gonna try to be
as discreet as I can, all right?
As far as going to the police,
until we have something solid,
thas a mistake.
I'm staking out
the mortuary tonight.
You have to trust me, okay?
Hey. Hey.
Captain Moped, wait up.
Hey, hey,
whas happenin',
wild thing?
You're lookin' cool tonight.
You must know Mickey Rourke.
[Growls]
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?
Here's my card.
My name is Rafe Guttman.
I'm-I'm out of cards.
[Growls]
Oh. Here to try
your luck again?
I've got good news foryou,
but I'm afraid there's only room for one.
This way, young man.
Sorry, kid.
Hey, wait a second!
You'll wait right here.
You got me?
So this is my pathway
to paradise, huh?
Oh, yes.
And the girls
are waiting foryou.
Ah, the girls.
Let them eat a guy named Cake.
[Chuckles]
They also like crumpet too.

Here, baby,

[Clears Throat]
We have a little problem
upstairs, I'm afraid.
##
Mr. Jenkins...
I understand
you have a problem.
I can't take it anymore.
Well, have you been
wearing sun block?
You know the sun is very hard
on undead skin.
And you're not even
fully undead yet.
Is a process.
I don't care what it is.
It hurts.
Men.
Such big babies.
Yeah, I just love a man
who gives you head...
and lets you keep it.
[Chuckles]
Lucy, I'm home.
Tammy, I love
what you've done with it.
Maybe I would hang a picture
of dogs playing poker over there.
But that would be
my only quibble.
Take off your clothes, worm.
[Laughing]
Whas that?
Medieval foreplay?
[Laughing]
Tamara, maybe
I'm a traditionalist,
but I've always thought
it should be ladies before worms.
So... you first.
You are not gonna
believe this,
but I almost
wore that tonight.
Wouldn't we have been
mortified?
Now is your turn.
All right.
[Gasps]
Leave your shirt on!
A little early to be repulsed,
isn't it?
[Gasps]
I thought
it was a cross.
Let me take it off.
Be gentle.
I used to be a virgin... I think.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Take it easy.
Easy.
[Sighing]
Pull back on the stick,
Amelia.
You know, the weave
isn't even paid foryet.
Now, what about this funky
little Barcalounger?
Break this down for me.
Well, first
I'd strap in one hand.
Yeah? Like this?
[Chuckling]
Yeah.
Then...
I presume,
the other hand goes there.
Right?
You comfy?
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
[Gasps]
[Screams, Gasping]
I hate
to be a painful party pooper,
but I gotta split, okay?
You have been
a super little host.
[Screaming]
You bastard!
##
[Approaching Footsteps]
[Creaking]
Huh. There's always
something going on.
Men. Always leaving
something behind.
I really am sorry.
Mmm.
I don't know
what happened.
One minute I thought I had him,
and the next...
[Sniffs]
I knew it.
Is one in a million.
Very rare, this blood type.
And I haven't tasted that
since... Ivan the Terrible.
That was
four centuries ago.
Hmm.
Mmm.
Oh, we gotta keep him alive.
[Spins Barrel]
Who the hell
are you?
The name's Lilith.
You left this behind.
Is not very nice to leave
a girl hanging like that.
I'll have to apologize
next time I see her.
I didn't mean her.
I meant me.
[Chuckles]
You know, I saw you
back at the house.
And when I did,
I knew you were special.
I'll bet you say that
to all the boys.
Yeah, but with you I mean it.
Listen, uh, Lilith,
I'm reasonably sure...
you're the type of woman
who's never heard
the expression "half-cocked,"
but that is exactly
what this gun is,
and I swear I'll use it.
You wouldn't shoot these,
now would you?
Go on. You can touch 'em.
I'll let you.
I'm not gonna tell you
those aren't the breasts of the century,
but I'mjust not
diggin'the owner.
So why don't you put those away?
You're not my type.
So what is your type?
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
Two, four, six, eight!
You can watch me masturbate!
Getting warmer?
No?
Mmm, then how about
something... like this?
Ooh.
[Giggling]
Ooh.
Can I tell you
something, Rafe?
Yeah.
When you were looking
at me before,
Mm-hmm.
I liked it.
I can't stop
thinking about you.
I can be just like her
if thas what you want.
I'd do anything foryou, lover.
[Katherine]
Rafe? Hello?
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Katherine.
Forget it, Rafe.
I'm going to the cops.
[Rafe]
How do I know
is a whorehouse?
- I was there. How's that?
- Isn't that interesting.
As I recall, your private
investigator's license was
suspended almost a year ago.
Were you aware of that, ma'am?
- No... I wasn't.
- Well, thank you.
And could you possibly get just a little
of that fuckin' stew inside your head?
Huh?
Could we shoot for that?
Is a license. Is paper.
It doesn't matter. Come on.
And the check foryour
license renewal bounced.
For Chriss sake, man,
there are people dying!
Isn't that more important
than my secretarial skills?
I didn't even know her
when I went there!
I was there as an everyday,
horny citizen, all right?
- Did you give this man money?
- You're fuckin' clueless.
Hmm. Well, seems to me...
the only person I should be
throwin' in jail is you.
Listen to me,
shit-for-brains...
Excuse me.
Deputy, I don't know
what to believe
at this point.
I know that you have
a lot of cases ahead of mine,
but Mr. Guttman did find this
at the mortuary.
Is my brother's.
Hmm.
Try not to eat it, Mongo.
I apologize for gettin'you
out ofbed at this hour.
Thas okay, officer.
What exactly was it
the gentleman said
happened here?
[Rafe]
Don't give me
that shit, Karloff.
[Opens Curtains]
Whad I tell you, kids?
Right there.
A coffin.
[Officer]
Uh-huh.
Is pretty suspicious
for a mortuary.
Noonan, you don't
wear irony very well.
Why don't you leave that
to the big boys?
Now watch what happens
when I pull this.
Watch this.
You stupid son of a bitch!
What the hell do you think
you're doing?
What happens, Barney Fife,
is the conveyor belt goes
all the way through the fire,
empties out into a room
down in the basement.
My God, that coffin cost me
more than a thousand dollars.
[Chuckling]
Look at little Olivier!
You are so utterly
full of shit.
Uh-huh.
Careful you don't
burn yourself on it now.
I'm sorry
to have bothered you.
Thas all right, officer.
Noonan, come on.
This is the entrance
to the whorehouse.
They knew I was comin' back
so they changed it.
They're gaslighting me.
Why the hell should I
want you to come back?
We've already thrown you out
of the parking lot tonight.
He was carrying on
with some woman in his car.
Disgusting!
The two of them
stoned out of their minds.
You're a goddamn liar.
Ow! Ow!
Don't you dare
take the Lorïs name in vain!
You were with a woman tonight
and have been drinking.
We can all smell it.
[Police Radio, Indistinct]
- Katherine...
- You know, you almost
had me believing you.
It would have served me right
for getting involved with a liar.
- And a fornicator.
- [Opens Door]
And an asshole.
[Engine Starts]
But a charming asshole!
[Car Departs]
[Lilith]
Hmm. Nice butt.
- You want me to finish him?
- [Lilith] No, I don't think
he'll bother us anymore.
Besides, you and me
have to talk.
About what?
Our future,
without the reverend.
If I were in charge here,
we'd have lots more fun.
You can't tell me you're
having fun working for the rev.
Plus, we're making
so much money
selling the cars.
Seems a shame
to give it to charity
when we could...
give it to someone
more deserving.
I'll make it happen
if you give me the key.
- How are things?
- Good. Good.
The girls are killing sinners
by the truckload.
The more...
[Chuckles]
The merrier.
J.C., I'd like to talk to you
about what I'm getting
from this bordello thing.
Brother Vincent,
we're doing this for the Lord.
Thas what you're getting from it.
I know that,
but I was thinking,
ifthere was some way I could
make a little extra money.
Maybe I could make...
Brother Vincent,
am I hearing you right?
Sorry,J.C.
Bad idea.
Didn't know what
I was thinkin:
Just forget
the whole thing.
# How I got over #
[Singers]
#How I got over#
# How I got over #
# How I got over #
#You know
my soul looked back #
#Soul looked back #
#And wondered
how I got over #
#And wondered how I got over #
#Yeah ##
This thing gonna work?
Absolutely.
Go.
Stop, Satan!
Stop right where you are!
I'm sending you back
to the fiery depths
where you belong.
[Satan Laughing
Wickedly]
I said...
I'm sending you back
to the fiery depths...
[Current Yells]
Cut! What the hell...
Cut it!
Just... God.
[Crew Shouting]
Look what he's done
to my guitar.
Whas he trying to do,
kill me?
We'll fix it,J.C.
Don't you worry.
You can wait in your office
while we reset everything.
Fine.
[Katherine]
That was scary.
I'll say. I don't know why
they have that laserlight
turned up so high.
It could have hurt someone.
Good Lord!
All he has to do is
reflect it onto the devil.
Bunch of morons.
Whatever has happened
to your brother,
I'm sure Satan had a hand in it.
## [Organ]
Was there something else
you wanted to talk about?
I'd like to make a documentary.
Really?
About?
Lust.
I want to warn young people
about all the things that inspire it.
You know, like strip joints
and dirty magazines, pornography.
## [Continues]
What else can I say, but...
onward, Christian soldier.
[Pallbearers Groaning]
[Groaning Continues]
[Pallbearers Muttering]
Be careful.
[Rafe]
"Flesh Eating Bacteria"?
The cat went from 280 pounds
to 114 pounds in three days?
Whas wrong
with this picture?
[Thunderclap,
Thunder Rumbling]
- [Cat Screeches]
- [Rafe Gasps, Sighs]
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Oh, Brother Vincent,
I was just looking foryou.
Where you going?
I have a doctor's appointment.
##
You're so right,
Vincent.
We should definitely expand
into places like this.
I want that one
for myself.
Hi.
[Current Clears Throat]
Vincent.
J.C.
Relax, sugar.
What the hell
is goin' on?
Game's over, Rev.
I'm drivin' now.
You vile, pernicious,
disgusting little harlot.
[Chuckles]
You're not so bad yourself.
I did not bring you here
for the purpose of feeding
your evil desires!
We are doing
the Lorïs work.
Vincent...
give me the key.
[Lilith]
No, Vincent.
Vincent!
Give me the key!
Hey, Rev, how'd you like to have
a real religious experience?
- [Bouncer] Hey.
- Katherine Verdoux,
Current World Ministries.
Jonas, follow me.
[Current, Vincent]
Oh, my God!
Don't touch
the camera.
Excuse me, sir.
Can you please tell me
why you come here?
This place
is unbelievable.
Hi, sweetie.
You really get around,
don't you?
You're into prostitution
and strip joints.
Mm-hmm.
You're a total sex maniac.
You need professional help.
You want to play doctor?
- [Jonas] Get your hands off of me!
- [Bouncer] Gimme the camera.
Oh, man.
Bingo. All right, boys,
big smiles now.
Beautiful.
Love it.
For Goïs sake, Vincent,
you are flirting
with eternal damnation!
Why don't you relax?
I bet that stick up your ass
hurts like hell.
[Lilith] I can't decide
what to do with you.
Should I kill you
or let you live
and make you my dog?
Vincent.
Vincent, give me the key.
- [Growls]
- Please. The key.
- ForGoïs sake, hurry.
- You leave that thing
right where it is.
- [Current]
Give me the key.
- Vincent.
Give it to me, and I will send this
demon slut back where she belongs!
Vincent,
what are you doing?
What I should have done
from the start.
- [Gasps]
- [Laughing]
No!
Thanks, honey.
Do us both a favor.
Kill him!
[Gasps]
Fuck, no.
I want to let him live.
I want this sanctimonious shit
to watch what happens
now that I'm free.
- Katherine?
- How did you get in here?
Katherine, I have something
I have to show you.
You don't give up, do you?
Is like a sickness
with you or something.
I went to the Mount Hope
Cemetery last night.
The McCutcheon Mortuary held
an internment there yesterday.
I took some photos.
These photos are the contents
of the coffin they interred.
I think you're gonna
want to look at 'em.
Just take a look.
Thas very nice.
You're worse than I thought.
You are really sick.
There were two bodies
in that coffin
when I took the pictures.
Two bodies.
Get your fuckin' hands off me.
Sure.
At least come to the cemetery,
for Chriss sake! Take a look!
[Sighs]
Sorry, Jonas.
[Security, Rafe Arguing]
Excuse me, sir.
Can you please tell me
why you come here?
There was a woman
at that table, wasn't there?
[Katherine On Tape]
You're into prostitution...
I wasn't talking to myself.
[Katherine]
I know there was somebody
at that table. Oh, my God.
[Katherine]
Look, there'sJ.C.
[Rafe] Where?
I don't see him.
Right there.
Well, I'll be damned.
There he is
with the demented Ewok,
Professor Loveless.
You know, Katie Scarlett,
never...
trust any man of God
with a boner.
I mean an erection.
Sorry.
No, boner's the right word.
Wow.
What is he doing there?
It doesn't make any sense.
Les get our facts
in order.
We have Reverend Current
leaving a topless bar.
Thas an odd one.
And we have photos
and videotape with people
who didn't photograph or record.
Follow that thread
of thinking.
Did not photograph.
Did not record.
I don't want you to flee.
I'm gonna advance a weird,
Duchovnyan riff.
What if what we're
dealing with here...
is, in fact... vampires?
Are you crazy?
Why is that crazy?
Because I advance the theory
that the perpetrator
of our crimes...
is an eternal spirit who
sustains itself solely...
through the intake ofhuman
hemoglobin through a set
of protracted fangs?
Shut up, Rafe.
Although... you have been right
about a lot of other things.
Wow.
Were you being nice
to me there, Katherine?
No. I just said you have been right
about a lot of other things.
Okay.
[Ringing]
Hello.
[Caleb]
Katherine, is that you?
Caleb?
[Whispers]
Is Caleb.
I need your help.
I'm in trouble.
Where are you?
I'm at the old power plant
on the south side.
They're coming for me.
You gotta help me. Please.
I'm in trouble.
They're coming for me.
Hurry. Hurry!
Katherine, I'm not complaining,
but I wish your brotherwould
have picked a less creepy place.
I feel like I'm in a bad
Tales from the Crypt episode.
Sorry.
I had Mexican for lunch.
Next time I'll ask him
to be more considerate.
Caleb!
Come on.
Caleb!
Where are you? God.
I think is really sweet
you wanna find your brother,
but we should split.
I'm getting some really bad
juju off this place.
Katherine.
Oh, my God.
Here, hold this.
Is he dead?
Is he breathing?
Hey, man, don't touch me
unless you love me!
Come on, dude, les party.
[Caleb Snarling]
- [Katherine] Rafe, no.
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- [Groans]
- Sorry, Katherine,
but that wasn't
your brother anymore.
Wrong! I'll always
be your brother... sis.
Katherine,
run from your brother.
Hurry!
I am.
Hurry!
I am.
[Caleb]
Katherine,
I'm coming foryou.
[Maniacal Laughter]
[Caleb]
I like this.
See the ladder? Up.
Katherine.
- [Caleb] Katherine? Katherine?
- [Rafe] Shit. We're screwed.
Les go back.
No, no, wait a minute.
I see a way.
What do you mean?
Jesus Christ, Katherine,
what are you doing?
Come on!
Is the fucking Grand Canyon!
- Just shut up and follow me!
- What are you doing with that chain?
That is the craziest
fuckin' thing I have ever...
Hi, dickhead.
That is the second craziest
fuckin' thing...
This is a mistake!
Have a little
chloroform, darling.
Too bad.
[McCutcheon, Vincent
Laughing]
[Noonan]
Is about fuckin'time.
I've gone to hell,
and is worse than I imagined.
Noonan, where am I?
Where's Katherine?
Now, don't you start
with that bullshit.
She was at the factory.
McCutcheon had her.
And that guy who worked
for Current was there.
And her brother.
What is this shit?
Get me outta here.
[Chewing]
Why don't you shut up?
Do you hear me, thumb dick?
They've got Katherine!
Now get me outta here!
[Grunting]
Nurse. Nurse.
[Nurse]
Still causing trouble, is he?
Officer, would you mind helping me?
[Rafe]
Listen, ifwe don't
stop these things,
they're gonna
destroy the city.
- Listen, you fat fuck...
- [Groaning, Gasps]
Tammy.
[Roaring]
[Screaming]
[Panting, Chuckling]
Remind me, Tammy.
Why do vampires hate sunrise?
[Gasping]
No. Oh, no. Oh, no!
Oh, no!
[Screams]
You want to keep it down?
I'm trying to rest!
I knew I should have
taken that private room.
- [Slurping]
- Caleb, please let me go.
- Sorry, no can do.
- [Gasps]
I gotta play by the rules here.
I know how you feel.
I didn't want to be a vampire either.
At first.
But afteryou get used to it...
is pretty damn cool!
Besides, you know me.
I've always been a night owl.
And getting to live forever
doesn't hurt either, does it?
You got that right.
Before we get down to business, darling,
I'm gonna take you fora test ride.
[Chuckling]
Oh, sis, can I watch?
Ah, first customer of the night.
What the hell
do you want?
I'm here to see Lilith.
I know I can't fight you all,
so I've come to join you.
- Is that right?
I'll be sure to tell her.
- No.
No, I want to tell her myself.
Come on, Jimmy, I know you
a little better than that.
Into the parlor,
Reverend, sir.
Get your filthy hands
off of me!
[Lilith] Feisty.
I like that.
[Gasping]
I like that
even better.
Mmm!
[Panting, Growling]
[Katherine]
Don't touch me.
[Sighs]
[Caleb Chuckling]
Very nice.
You're disgusting.
[Lilith]
Breasts are always nice.
But I prefer...
[Caleb Panting, Snorting]
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[Caleb Continues Panting]
- Ooh!
- [Gasps]
I guess this is the end
of a beautiful relationship.
[Tires Screeching]
[Screaming]
[Snarls]
Oh, shit.
Whas happenin', Rev?
Come on, man, talk to me!
I'm jumpy! Friend or foe?
For Goïs sake,
I am responsible for all this,
but I've come to end it.
[Sighs]
All right, all right.
I'll give you this.
Is holy water, man.
This might work for the others,
but it won't do a lick of good
against Lilith.
No, to get her, we're gonna
have to get in real close.
We're gonna have to put
a stake in Lilith?
I'm telling you that to kill her,
we're gonna have
to cut her heart
into four pieces.
Some chicks demand
special attention.
Les do it.

[Chuckles Weakly]
[Vampire Screams Echoing]
[Current]
My God, what have we done?
[Rafe] Don't flake on me.
They're vampires.
Send them to hell.
[Caleb Panting,
Snorting, Chuckling]
Katherine?
[Creaking]
Howdy, honey.
You are outta here.
Oh, shit!
This sucks.
[Groans]
[Gasping]
Katherine!
Help! Hurry!
Before Lilith comes back!
Katherine, is me.
Is me,J.C.
Now, don't you worry.
I'm gonna get you outta here.
Just give me a second
while I undo these straps.
I'm sorry if I touch you
somewhere I shouldn't.
Is okay,J.C.
You can touch me.
You can touch me anywhere you want.
[Grunting]
[Current Yells, Gasps]
[Roars]
Fuck you.
[Chuckles]
[Lilith's Laughter Echoing]
[Rafe]
Katherine.
Where's Katherine?
- [Muffled Whimpering]
- [Drops Axe]
Katherine!
Christ, you're so pale.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Hurry.
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?
Just checking
for punctures.
Can't be too sure.
Come on.
- Oh, my God.
- [Gasping, Panting]
You gotta...
You gotta hurry.
[Panting]
Go... Go back to the studio.
[Continues Panting]
Broadcast.
Tell the...
world.
[Exhales]
All you have to do is
point the camera at me
and keep it in focus.
- TellJonas to start
the uplink and go.
- Okay, you got it.
We'll have uplink in...
30 seconds.
[Rafe]
We'll go in 30 seconds.
[Sighs]
Okay.
[Demonic Laughter]
- What the hell...
- [Demonic LaughterContinues]
Katherine?
[Katherine]
Jonas, what the hell
are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything, man.
- Katherine.
Rafe, tellJonas to turn it off.
[Rafe]
I don't think he can hear us.
I heard her, I heard her!
- What now?
- [Voice] So long.
[Vampire Roars]
[Rafe]
Jonas, can you hear me?
Jonas, are you there?
Can you hear me?
I'm coming up there.
Rafe! Hello?
Whas going on?
[Rafe]Jonas.
Honey, Jonas doesn't
work here anymore.
I retired him.
Ooh! Pretty strong
for a little guy.
[Chuckles]
So you wanna fuck?
Lilith, I'd rather Crazy Glue my dick
to the bullet train than fuck you.
How's that?
Trying to impress your girlfriend?
I'm gonna fix that now.
[Gasps]
Shit. Katherine.
Katherine!
Katherine, get out now.
Katherine, she's coming.
Oh, my God.
Katherine!
[Lilith]
I'm afraid God can't help you.
[Grunts]
How am I doin', lover?
You gettin' hot?
I thought we could
work this thing out.
You could have his mind,
and I could have his body.
I guess I was wrong.
[Gasping]
Face it,
the best you can hope for
is a charity fuck!
[Snarling]
[Gasping]
You know, I've never
killed a woman before,
but I'm kind of
looking forward to it.
[Laserlight Alarm Beeping]
- [Alarm Continues]
- Rafe!
[Hissing]
[Sighs]
No. No.
I guess Reverend Limpdick
forgot to tell you.
- Shit!
- You can tear my heart to pieces,
but it won't do any good
ifis still here.
- Fuck!
- [Lilith Hissing]
- [Hissing, Snarling]
- Come on, Lilith.
You're holding in a lot ofanger.
You gotta see a vampire shrink.
Come on. Lilith.
[Continues Hissing]
- Can't we talk about this?
- As far as I'm concerned,
you and I are through.
Lilith. Lilith, baby.
I want you to know
I'm not happy.
I didn't mean it!
I didn't mean it about the bullet train.
[Snarling]
- [Rafe]
Can't we talk about this?
- [Hisses]
- Please?
- Sure. After.
Come on.
Baby. Snookums.
I'm through
talking now, baby.
First I'll rip
yourdick off,
then I'm gonna grind your balls
into guacamole.
[Lilith Gasping]
Heartless bitch.
[Shrieking]
[Sighs]
That should do the trick.
When I consecrate a vampire,
they stay consecrated.
Thank you, Rabbi.
Does this go with my shirt?
Is lovely.
[Rafe]
Katherine, I don't want
to beat a dead vampire here,
but I really want
to thank you for coming
to my rescue back there.
Thas okay, you can beat it
some more if you want to.
What was that?
A little comeback?
[Chuckling]
Thas so sweet.
Good foryou.
Les say
I owe you one.
No, you don't.
I had my own reasons
for saving you.
And a come-on too.
Am I hearing this?
Is this a whole new
Katherine emerging?
Maybe. I don't know.
You think you can learn
to love me like this?
Well, I'm certainly
willing to give it
the old college try.
Afteryou.
Oh, well, thank you.
I'll put that in my satanic
bric-a-brac collection.
I have a friend at NASA.
We're gonna send that
damn thing into space.
Well, we could do that...
I suppose.
You have a better idea?
Mm-hmm.
[Kissing, Sniffing]
Whas that perfume
you're wearing?
Is not perfume.
Is sun block.
[Hissing]
[Screaming]
Well, kiddies,
I guess Katherine
learned in the end...
that the fastest way
to a man's heart
is through his rib cage.
[Laughing]
Still, I think they make
a fabulous couple.
They're a regular
Romeo and Ghouliet.
And when they do have
the occasional disagreement,
at least now she'll know
whas eating him.
She is!
[Laughing]
Looks like I won.
[Mummy]
What are you talking about,
dear boy?
Come on.
Les play again.
Huh?
Double or nothing.
Take my advice, pal.
Quit while you're "a head."
[Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
