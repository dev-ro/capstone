-Me too
Back when it meant something
One big union
-Not around here buddy
C.E. Lively
This is my restaurant, fellas
are waitin'
They don't give a damn whether
we live or die
Just so long as they get the
coal out of the ground
They had us pulling pillars and
the roof was working, you know
Like it does before it's going
to fall down
If i say i ain't dying in here
and walk away
They'll put me down in some damn
puddle in a 2 foot seam
And no air to breathe..A man
can't mine coal that way
They're just pushing us further
than we can go
The check wayman he'll take 50
pound off your load for slate
When there ain't a pebble in it
It's down in the bottom where
they ain't looking for it
Then they raise the prices that
the company store the same god
Damn week that they lower the
tonnage rate
And they still ain't rock dusted
that damn hole
Who am i talking about?
-Jesus
I can't hear you?
-Jesus!
I still can't hear you?
-Jesus!!
Jesus christ our lord do you
know his name?
Hallelujah, say yeah
Have you felt the warming
comfort of his precious love
Praise jesus
Praise his holy name
Parise his blessed spirit
Praise his everlasting love
jesus christ our lord
Listen to me now, listen to me
The prince of darkness
Is upon the lion
Amen
-In the bible his name is
beelzebub
Lord of the flies
Right now on earth today
His name is bolshevick
Socialist!, communist!, union
man
Lord of untruth sower of evil
seed, enemy of all that is good
And pure and this creature
Walks among us
What are we going to do about
it?
First thing we got to have is
all of these niggers and all
These dagos that come in here to
take our jobs thrown out of the
Mines
Mines hell! They got 'em in our
houses, they're setting at our
Tables right now
And they're sleeping in our beds
while we're out living under a
Piece of canvas at the back of
the holler
I been a union man my whole life
I know the story with these coal
operators and their gun thugs
The only thing they understand
is the bad end of a bullet
If we show them, we just assume
blow up their damn mines than
Seen them worked by a bunch of
scabs and then they gonna listen
Someone is coming, it's alex. He
got someone
Where did you find him?
He come right up on the steps
They told me that c.E. Lively is
where the union mens meet
So?
I biznus wit the union
That's so?
What's your name son?
They calls me few clothes
(laughs)
I didn't come here looking for
no trouble
A mans got to eat
-So why don't you go eat, back
where you come from?
They told me that they was jobs
here
Go home nigger
-God damn scab
You watch your mouth peckerwood
I been called nigger and i can't
help that the way white folks is
But i ain't never been called no
scab!
And i ain't fixin to start up
now
I got ton for ton loading coal
with any man here
And when i do, i expects the
same dollar for the same work
You get out of this hollar alive
son you be doin' good for
Yourself
Union men my ass!
You want to be treated like men
You want to be treated fair
You ain't men to that coal
company
Your equipment
Like a shovel, a gondola car
A hunk of wood brace
They'll use you till you wear
out or you break down
Or your buried under a slate
fall and then they'll get a new
One
And they don't care what color
it is or where it comes from
It doesn't matter how much coal
you can load
Or how long your family has
lived on this land
If you stand alone you just so
much sh*t to those people
You think this man is your
enemy?
Huh?
This is a worker
Any union keeps this man out
Ain't a union
It's a god damn club
Now they got you fighting white
against colored
Native against foreign, holler
against holler
When you know there ain't but
two sides to this world
Them that work and them that
don't
You work
They don't
That's all you got to know about
the enemy
You say you got guns
Well i know that you all are
brave men
And i know you could shoot it
out with the company if you had
To
But the coal company don't want
this union
And the state government don't
want it
The federal government don't
want it
And all of them just waiting for
an excuse to come down and crush
Us to nothing
Fellas we're in a hole full of
coal gas here
The tiniest spark at the wrong
time is going to be the end of
Us
So we got to pick away at this
situation slow
And careful
We got to organize and build
support
We got to work together
Together!
Till they can't get their coal
out of the ground without us
Because we're a union
Case we're the workers damn it!
And we take care of each other
How can we shut the mines down
if we don't dynamite them
The men walk out
All of them
Fat chance
And every man that walks out on
his own steam
We take into the union
All the dagos and all the
colored?
That's what a union is fellas
You better get used to it
So this fella owns a vineyard,
goes out first thing one morning
And he hires some workers
Says he'll give 'em a dollar for
the day which was decent wages
In biblical times
Well then he's at the
marketplace and he sees some
Other fellas and he hires them
And some more at noon and some
at 2 and some at 5 and every
Time it's the same deal
A dollar for the day and he's
hiring all day long right up
Till 1 hour before quitting time
Look we're real sorry to barge
in on you like this
But it's come to a point where
we got to talk to you
Now i know you people got it
hard coming to a new country
You don't know the rules
Don't know how things work
You don't know sh*t about mining
coal that's for sure
They been dying like flies in
that #3 hole
But how it is
You don't have a whole lot of
choice in this thing
You know what a union is?
Cindagato
cindagato?
What the situation is
We need every..
-We join the union they shoot us
We no join the union you shoot
us
Well, that's one way of looking
at it
Those dagos are driving me crazy
Now what's he playing?
-Shhhh
Now who's that?
(Harmonica playing)
Peckerwood is gone pass
Union men will be up in a few
minutes
What we talking here for?
-You want to walk back to
Alabama?
The sun goes down and he sends
for his foreman and he says to
Go pay off the workers starting
with the ones he picked up just
An hour ago and to pay everyone
of them the same dollar a day
And of course the fellas that
went out first
Is roped off about this
So they get to agitating,
complaining so loud that the
Owner come up and he says look
it
We dealt for a dollar and that's
what you get
And what i pay anybody else is
none of your look out so there
Now that's all the gospel story
says except for the moral jesus
Drew out of it
And so jesus says
Thus it will be in the kingdom
of heaven the first will be last
And the last will be first
Now it's clear from this parable
That jesus hadn't heard nothin'
about the union
If he was walking the earth
today and seen the situation we
Got with these coal operators
he'd changed his tune
A man deserve an hourly wage
he'd say for those the pit be
Gassy and the face full of
slate, a man still toileth by
The sweat of his brow
And what's a better deal here on
earth, no matter i got in store
For him in the hereafter
Praise jesus!
Kennehan

They're sneaking them in for a
night shift
Let's go fellas

missionary the other night
Talking union from the pulpit

(Yelling)
They're down the hill!
Over here
Now fellas put their lanterns
out
Just hit the dirt
I think this belongs to you
(Yelling in italian)
I'm with him
All of you union men let's
welcome our new brothers
(Cheers)
From now on
Stone mountain don't move one
piece of coal unless it's a
Union man that moves it
(Cheers)
Let's get out of here
(Singing in italian)
In them days the coal company
owned your houses, they owned
Your land, they owned most of
the town and the people who run
It
If you wasn't for the company,
there wasn't too many places you
Could go that was still on the
map
The union didn't have too much
they could give to the people
Back then
All we got in common is our
misery
Joe kennahan used to say and the
least we can do is share it
(Speaking italian)
She got the evil eye that one
Oh mama
Don't you let me catch you
peeking over there she got the
Evil eye if i've ever seen it
Well what do we got here?
We bring you some food mama
stole it from the company
Quite danny
-Well we can use anything you
Got
You people are crazy, you ain't
never gonna win this thing
Then what are you helping us
for?
I got work to do
Appreciate your help
I ain't never seen everybody all
together like this
Company don't stand a chance
Jessie...
What's the pitch?
Well i was just saying to the
mayor here how
We're all trying to do our jobs,
you, and me and him
And nobody is paying us enough
to be dodging no bullets for it
Um, now.
Mr. Felts has authorized me to
Make it more attractive for you
gentleman to cooperate
Town ain't for sale mister
What about you?
Now i figure that little show
you were putting on out there
The other day was just for
bargaining power
Or are you going to be stupid
too?
Either you sh*t  hogs lift a
finger
In town limits i'll put you away
Damn hillbillys always gotta do
it the hard way
You boys are going up against
some
Pretty big people
Don't push your luck
How's jesse these days?
-Oh she's okay sid
You think they're bluffing?
Nope.
Neither am i
Now the way the relief fund
works is kind of tricky
Cause all the different
situations we got going around
The country
We stretched real thin, there's
a lot of strategy to who gets
What and when
I report to the strike committee
They evaluate the progress we're
making here and the political
Situation
And then they release the strike
fund to us
You mean they cut us off?
No, the amount we get is based
on..
What if they think we're going
to lose?
Look the strike committee
considers what's best for the
Union as a whole but that
doesn't mean..
Politics boys
Gonna play union, you gotta play
politics
I'm sure joe don't like that no
more than you do
I don't like it one damn bit
Me neither, i didn't get into
this thing so i can have one
More boss to tell me what to do
The union isn't your boss, it's
you
Then why we gotta wait?
For some hunkies up in
pittsburgh to give us the word
To move
Cause it's a democracy, it's
like the united states
Democracy
-That's a joke
Quiet
Get down they're shooting
Just keep your head down son
I'll make a night of it
I think he just got a little
piece of bullet left in there
Company doctor said he wouldn't
come out
But there's a fella in fifle on
the kentucky side that'll treat
Union men on this lie
He'll be here by noon
Will he treat colored?
He treats union. He'll treat
colored
More water danny
-Yes ma'am
You just hold this up there
against that real gentle
Don't press hard
-Elma you seen any of the men?
Only them that's wounded
How's ya doing?
-Not bad
At least nobody got killed
No thanks to you
Take it easy buddy
Morning joe
Hey bridey
You seen any of the fellas?
-Not a one
He's real nice lookin'
He likes me, i can tell
How?
-I just know men that's all
That'd make a cat laugh
If you want to make that kind of
slop
For dinner you go back home and
make it
This is united states here and
we do things differently
Listen to me, you can learn
Something here
C'mon ladies what's the problem?
I thought she was going to make
up some cornbread with it well
You should see the slop she come
up with
Miss elkins
These people got their own way
of doing things
Well that is a waste of good
corn meal if you ask me
She makes up this porrigly kind
of mess i wouldn't feed it to
The pigs
Where's all the men gone to?
That changes the whole picture
What i'm saying is unions is
fine for some things
But for other things a man has
to go on his own
Of course that's up to you
Roscoe
You make cindicato, you do what
the cindicato say
I listen to joe
Few clothes
We gonna be shooting white folks
right?
That's the idea
People you hear about black
folks shooting white folks
No matter what it's for there's
going to be hell to pay
You gotta point
Well then
If you gentleman will excuse us
You people have been put out of
stone mountain mine housing
And some of you have seen fit to
take along certain items
Of food, furniture and clothing
that don't belong to you but
Belong to the company
Now as of the day of the strike
your script ceased to be legal
Tender meaning
That any item of food, clothing,
and furniture not paid for in
Cash money
Must be turned over to me
And my deputies and i suggest
you all cooperate
See my boys
They didn't get much sleep last
night so they're kinda jumpy
Besides we got the law on our
side
You ain't no law you got to slip
around the real law
You just got guns is all
You just thugs
Yeah maybe your right sonny
We just got guns
You still got to hand in them
goods
Yellow scab herder you
You hurt? You get up from there
-You gotta list of goods
Don't need one
How you gonna know what belongs
to the company and what don't?
He's the red hickey
He's the agitator
Everybody you see i don't got a
gun on me
What good do you think that's
going to do you red?
You shoot me folks e'll know it
was murder
Well that's some cold comfort
Now you listen to me red
We was hunting
You folks are making an awful
lot of commotion
You scaredt all the game away
This your machine?
Heard it last night too
It's an offense to the ear
Hold it pops your talking to the
law here
He ask you anything?
Where did you get that thing
pal? Spanish war?
Nope
War between the states
You all get in this machine and
get into town where you belong
Ain't but one law out here and
that's the law of nature
Let's get the hell out of here
Folks try and keep the noise
down you'll do fine
Help yourself to the bird and
the rabbit
You see any hogs they probably
ours, we'd appreciate it if
You'd leave them be
Good day to you
Are you okay joe?
Yeah i'll be all right if it
weren't for my ribs
Who were those people?
Rossons mostly
And a shuttleworth
They miners?
-You never find them folks near
A hole, they have most of their
land stole by the company
They's hill people
-Foothill people really your
Genuine hill people
They can be dangerous
Now the thing you gotta remember
son
Is your fuse burns 1 foot per
minute
Make it too long they might see
it
Make it too short,
Well i'll be meeting you on the
other side
(Knocking at door)
Damn it

Attraction

Heartfelt desires

Heartfelt desires
Dearest
Joseph

Are you drawing breath son?
Baldwins, we were sold

Sephus purcell
Kin to nimrod purcell?
That's daddy's uncle

From behind
None of them purcells ever was

He is bleeding like a stuck pig
I found 'em boys, he's here
It's reese
Got yourself a martyr
I tired to stop this
Any sign of sephus?
We'll maybe smell him before we
see him
They found somebody?
Just stay right here honey,
don't want to look at that mess
But i got something for mr.
Kennehan
I don't think he's in no mood to
be bothered right now
I'll see he gets it
Who is it?
Oh just some poor miner whose
troubles is finally over
Don't look honey
I talked to elix he says your
phonograph machine
Is going to be fixed in a couple
days now
It's awful nice of you to do
everett
Well we got to take care of our
favorite lady now don't we
You been so generous
Thinking about me when that mr.
Kenerhan got you all so busy
With the union
That mr. Kenerhan is what i come
to talk to you about bridey
I got a suspicion he might not
be what he says he is
What do you mean?
Bridey
Did you send kenerhan some sort
of letter?
What do you want?
No.
He wouldn't
There's a whole crowd of fellas
standing around him i seen
Kenerhan laughing and waving
that letter
So i
Come over to see what was so
funny
A lot of fellers?
You mind if i have another drink
honey
It ain't purdy what i gotta say
He said some things bridey
She been following me around
ever since i got here
Trailing after me like a dog in
heat
Sniffing around my legs like a
brood bitch
She don't wear no drawers he
says so she can be ready for
Whatever stumbles down the
pathway
He didn't!
He didn't
He said you done it with one of
the coloreds
Lying bastard
Bridey
I think it might be worse than
that
I think he might be a spy
In with the coal operators
Well he's got the fellas so
turned around with all this talk
I need for you to help me bridey
And sometimes you gotta tell a
little bit of a lie
Just to get the truth across
We fight them with guns
We lose
That's the whole damn story
I'm not going to bulls*it you
fellas and tell you there won't
Ever come a time when the people
that own this state send the
Word down to have us all
murdered
But if we don't stand together
now
As workers we got no hope at all
Help me up
You going somewhere?
This is miner's business and you
ain't no miner
You two come along
So, um
Last night he comes up here and
Uh, he's all drunk and
everything and i says as how i
Didn't want to have nothin' to
do with him and
And i would call some of you
fellers
For help and
He says that all of you was
Taking care of
Taking care of huh?
When i seen that there wasn't no
help i ...
He uh, kinda
Forced me, he...
He forced me
Easy...
That's okay you better hear this
first hand
Go ahead honey, what happened
then
And afterwards he
Thrown money on the bed like i
were some kind of a whore
You done just fine honey
Now why don't you go sit outside
for a minute while we figure out
What we're going to do about
this
So he don't have no sense with
women
So what?
You know how bridey builds
things up
Take a look at this
That our friend left laying on
the floor last night
Baldwin felts agency
What it say?
-It's a death warrant is what
For mr. Joseph kinerhan
(Knocks on door)
So it's goodbye mr. Kinerhan
tonight
Miners?
How'd you manage that?
That tramp that goes to meet the
passenger train
Seems she's got the eye for
kinerhan
So he put it in her head that
kinerhan has been bad mouthing
Her all around town
He's got her down there right
now crying to the miners
And..He's got these papers from
loufield
I didn't leave my colt like this
You spying little bastard!
What'd you hear huh?
What did you hear?
-Nothin'
Horse sh*t hit him bill!
See this medal
You know how i won this preacher
boy huh?
I was sitting alone in a ditch
in france and this kraut jumps
In right next to me
And i took my bayonets
And i stuck him right in the
face
And then another jumps in and i
stick him too
And another, and another
And another they just kept
coming one at a time all night
Long
And a little bit i got too
worried that they weren't all
Dead so
I stuck them all again a couple
times just to make sure
And in the morning
They said that i was a war hero
Well i'm going to stay close to
you tonight preacher boy
And you let one wrong word fly
And i'm going to put one in your
skull
And i'll do the same for your
pretty mama
You know i ain't lying don't ya
boy?
Yes sir
Man who draws the short straw
gets to do the job
And word don't travel beyond
this room about who it is
The rest of us will want a good
alibi
I figure in that prayer meeting
tonight
Right under the preacher's nose
Welcome to the union son
What's the story?
Flutie that the baldwins was
coming out here tonight
And i'm supposed to stick by you
You got the sh*t detail again

You all right danny?

scripture than i do
And that ain't a whole hell of a
lot is it grigsy?
You know any?
I never got no further was in
the beginning was the word guess
We both doomed to the hot place
(Laughs)
Lord relies on little sh*ts like
this one to spread his word, i
Don't want no truck with heaven
And as for hell, well we been to
west virginia (laughs)
Â¶(singing a hymn)â¶
(Laughing in the back)
Ahhh

son? I just got your licks all
Stopped and here your trying to
bust them open again
I got to get down there, they
got to know
You ain't goin' nowheres unless
it's in a pine box
Where's your sense?
I got to
I wish those fellas'd get here
Huh?
If they're comin' i wish they'd
hurry up, i don't want any more
Shooting in the woods
You ever use one of those?
10th calvary
In cuba 2nd 98th
San juan hill
Pretty rough down there?
Did what i had to
Is it true you're a red?
Yeah i suppose it is
Then how come you don't carry a
gun?
Well we carry little round bombs
Don't you read the papers?
I want to tell you tonight about
the blackness in the heart of
Man
Gonna warn you about the many
and devious ways in which satan
Will hide from you the truth
Of who your real friends are
I'm going to do it with a story
from the patriarchs
Now we all know about joseph and
how out of all jacobs 12
Children he was the smartest and
the smoothest and how his
Brothers got so jealous they
pulled off his coat of many
Colors and whooped on him and
left him out to be sold into
Slavery
But joseph was not your ordinary
fella even for biblical times,
He had a special way with him
A way of looking at the grand
scheme of things
So when this fella podafar
bought him for a slave
Joseph just smiled and vowed he
was going to be a good one,
Making the best of a bad
situation
He put his heart to his work and
was honest and friendly in his
Dealings and before you knew it
he was just about running
Podafars households and fields
and all his business' for him
The only trouble was podafar's
wife
Now she was what you might call
a loose woman
When i was in leavenworth there
was a bunch of mennonites
Mainly because they wouldn't
fight in the war, it's against
Their religion
It's also against their religion
to shave their beards or
Wear buttons on their clothes
and they was being forced to do
Both by the prison guards
So they refused to work
And they went on a strike right
there in hell's half acre
They was handcuffed to the bars
of a cell house
8 hours a day for two full weeks
They were put with their arms up
like this
So's they had to stand on their
toes or those cuffs would cut
Into their wrists
Can't nobody stay on their toes
8 hours
So pretty soon
Their fingers would start to
swell up
They turned blue and then
They'd crack open
Blood would run down their arms
8 hours a day
Day after day
Still they wouldn't work
Still they tore the buttons off
their uniforms every time they
Were sewed back on
They tore them with their teeth
because they're hands wouldn't
Close no more
So now i don't claim the fame
for myself
But them fellas they never
lifted a gun in their lives
And you couldn't find any braver
in my book
I wish them fellas would get
here
Also in podafar's employ at this
time were a couple of spies from
One of his enemies
Fellas that wanted to bring him
down in the world and get their
Hands on his fields and houses
They seen the want and lust in
miss podafar
And seen it would be good for
their purposes to get shed of
The young joseph
So they come to podafar's wife
(Harmonica playing)
She calls joseph in and she asks
him one more time, joseph will
You lie with me?
And he says no ma'am i won't
And she sets up and grabs a hold
of his garment he's wearing and
Runs it in two before he can get
clear
Podafar runs in with his guards
and she's bawling her eyes out
And shaking like a leaf, your
servant joseph, she says
He come in here and tried to
make me lie with him
Only when i called out he fled
leaving this here garment as
Evidence
And now only that she says she'd
been spying and plotting against
You with your enemies he means
to take over here and have you
Killed
But podafar had no reason to
misbelieve his wife
Joseph was a slave and a
foreigner
So he gathered up his servants
and household workers and they
Went and slew joseph dead
Cut him from gut to gizzard and
left him bleeding in the street
And though they never learned of
miss podafar's lies and went to
Their maker unrepentant with
innocent blood on their hands
Draw your own conclusions
Â¶(singing hymn)â¶
Gettin' awful late
-Shhhhh
You hear something?
No.
Yeah i think i did
Like somebody moaning
Maybe it's the fellas
I think we should go out there
and have a look
Who's that?
(Laughs)
That's (laughs)
(Laughs) mingala
Well we better get back to camp
-(Laughs)
Wait a minute (laughs)
Well at least we didn't waste a
trip
(Fire bell blaring)
No way it won't spread
Is c.E. Inside?
No such luck
Find that son of a bitch
(Fire bell blaring)
(Train whistle blowing)
How come they waste more food in
one day than a poor workers
Family has on their table in a
week?
Now let me ask you? Who's sweat
was it that went into building
Those mansions
-Once they seen hell, they'd
almost done an innocent man it
Was like joe couldn't say no
wrong
We moved out into mango county
then
Spreading the word about the
union
Spreading like wildfire over the
red jacket
The ragland and dale barton all
up and down the tug fork river
Brining the union out to all the
folks that needed help
Putting the spirit into them and
trying to shut down the whole
Southwest field
-Helping themselves to our land
and our labor for too damn long
Â¶(singing in italian)â¶
Joe kinerhan said how there was
a new day comin' and sometimes i
Could just about see it
But it were a dangerous living
for a union man and you didn't
Dare turn your back
Hit with hard times and hit with
hungry times too
The union relief was spread thin
in hope of a new day you can
Feed your soul
But leave your belly rumbling
Scoot!
Lady?
Since there's just me and
hillard, and you got all these
Little ones
Well...
You know what to do with this?
Hillard brung it in
It's for you
I ain't gonna watch no babies go
hungry, now here you go on
Here is some navy beans
And these here is ramps now you
can cook with these
They put a taste in your stew
Anyhow
Well, i...
Figure we's all in this together
We sure got some pretty babies
Who's your favorite pitcher?
-Hot eller
He's from logan county
You get to play ball much?
When the mines were open
Joe...
Yeah
You ever kill anybody?
What brought that up?
Bet sid has
Here in the war
All i saw was workers killin'
workers
And it wasn't any point in it
They thrown you in jail cause
you wouldn't go?
Them two years kept me from
killin some poor stiff that got
Pushed out on a battlefield by
rich folks and politicians
And they were worth it
It's gettin' dark danny
You better go get that coal
You see there, right there by
the railroad trestle
That's where cap hatfield and
his boy joe glen killed three
Men
Boy wasn't but 13
Used a winchester
You think it hurts much? A
bullet?
Beats dying in a damn coal mine
Boy wasn't but 13 year old joe
glen
Must be in there
He always sleeps with the lights
on
Just gotta be quiet though
(Gunshot)
-Let's get the little bastards
-Over here
-Grab him, cut him off
Well, well what we got here?
Smarts a little don't it boy?
Hillard right?
Now, how about you give us the
names of your ring leaders up in
Logan
Give us 5 names boy, that's all,
5 names and we'll let you go
That's fair isn't it?
-Never
Grigsy
Talk to us boy
(punches him)
Talk to us
I'll rot in hell first
-Have it your way
Mr. Lively
Boy, i sentence you to death for
the crime of stealing company
Property
And being a dirty bolshevist
human man
You got 10 seconds to talk
Talk
Whoo, what a smell, boy dirtied

To stir things up
(Crying in the distance)
Baldwin's coming into town

You fellas have any idea what's
waiting for us?
You mean they didn't tell you?
Oh i just seen a line in the
papers of opportunity for red
Blooded american men
Immediate openings, high pay
Travels, chance for advancement,

Your own ticket
The natives get restless
someplace they put that out
You ever hear of the hatfields

Yeah of course i have
This is one of their stomping
grounds
They'll put a bullet in your
brain as soon as they look at ya
Sid, we have authorization to
put these miners off company
Property here in town
Not from me you don't
And we also go a warrant for
your arrest you give us any
Trouble
This ain't worth sh*t and you
know it
One way or another we're going
to carry out these evictions
Tomorrow morning
Gentleman
Hey come to kill me
Hillard was my friend
When i first come down to the
mines it was hillard who'd show
Me what to do
He was a good coal miner, a good
union man
And he always took care of his
mama
I don't know how they could have
done him like they did
All he wanted to do was live
decent, that's all
Sometimes people say how god
willed it, how everything is his
Plan
Well...i don't think he planned
on hillard laying here amongst
All these elinson's not this
young in his life
I think all god plans is we get
born and we got to take it from
There
So you rest in peace hillard
You rest easy cause we're going
to take up where you left off
Amen
You gonna tell us to turn the
other cheek still
Shootin' is what they want now
Then maybe it's what we want too
Expect too much of people joe
Your still after that one big
union but most of us
We can't see past this holler
Â¶(singing gospel)â¶
I need to talk to the men
Be decent now
I'll call a meeting in the
morning
First thing
Â¶(gospel singing continues)â¶
Pastor said stay away from town
tomorrow
Is something up?
Got a feelin' you know how white
folks gets when they're all
Excited
Nothin' is going to bring
hillard back you know
And i came here to help
Sure you did
First people come here to help
us with some money
Next we know we got no land
Then they say they're going to
help us with a job and a place
To live
And they stick us in some damn
coal camp
And let us dig out their mines
Now you come here to help us
bring in the new day
Well hillard ain't gonna see no
new day
We had about as much help as we
can stand
We gotta take care of ourselves
We got to take care of each
other
Â¶(harmonica playing blues tune)â¶
Joe!, joe! The men go to town
See it?
No need for you to be in on this
It's my town too, they're my
people
Y'all have no right to come to
this here town with all these
People and drawing guns and
terrorizing them
The writs you have are not valid
for this town
If you can't get one..
-No!!!!!
Oh...
Jesus don't shoot me
I just want to talk
I just want to talk
(Gun firing)
I can't feel my legs
(Softly sobbing)
There was a trial but there
wasn't nobody going to pass
Guilty on sid hatfield in mango
county
Sid got married to mayor
testerman's widow and then the
Baldwins they caught him unarmed
Walking up the steps of the
mcdowd county court house
They shot 15 bullets into him
Right in broad daylight and c.E.
Lively stepped in and put one
Right through his skull
Wasn't even a trial on that one
That was the start of the great
cold feet war and us miners took
The worst of it like joe said we
would
It's just one big union the
whole world over as joe kenerhan
Used to say
And from the day of the mate 1
massacre that's what i preached
That was mreligion
We buried joe kenerhan with our
own
My mama she thought it wouldn't
never stay
But now he's with us for always
Laying up here in these west
virginia hills
Â¶(singing slow country song)â¶
