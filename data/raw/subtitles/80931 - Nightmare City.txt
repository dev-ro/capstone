Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.
From the channel 5 newsroom.
At the top of the news
this evening is speculation
concerning the real facts
behind the department of
health announcement about a
radioactive spill supposed
to have occurred yesterday
at the state nuclear plant.
lnformation from an official
source, which reached our
newsroom this afternoon,
stresses the seriousness
of the situation.
But at the same time,
provides a certain amount
of reassurance, concerning
already contained any damage
caused by the accident.
Hello, Miller.
Mr.Desmond's waiting for you
Go right in.
The arrival here, expected
at any moment,
of professor Otto Hagelberg.
One of the original planners
of the nuclear station,
will undoubtedly enable
us to obtain more
precise information.
You heard?
He's arriving tomorrow
morning at eleven.
Take one of the best
camera men with you.
Why me in particular?
Because l want an exhaustive
interview, which will
reassure all our viewers.
Not just the truth,
pure and simple?
Forget the philosophy,
Miller.
Just do what you are told.
lf possible, Sir.
Only if possible.
He hasn't arrived yet.
Find out which runway
they're landing on.
Okay.
Clipper 981 . Cellcode OK.
Request cellcode on 5626.5.
Clipper 981 this is
Glipswick standby.
Glipswick,
this is Clipper 981 .
Will do.
Glipswick Tower,
this is flight 777,
out of Selkirk.
Hey, Wayne, come over here.
Flight 777 we'll lead you,
stand by...
What have you got?
Unidentified trace
- What's the bearing?
About 30 miles north east
altitude approximately 5000.
Control tower here.
There's a trace approaching
from the north east,
distance about thirty miles.
We've seen it control tower.
Doesn't seem to fit in
with any of our data.
We're trying to
identify it now.
Try to make contact.
Calling aircraft about
thirty miles north east of
Glipswick tower.
ldentify yourself.
Calling aircraft about
thirty miles north east of
Glipswick tower.
ldentify yourself,please.
lt could be his radio
isn't working.
Glipswick tower.
This is Twin Beach Craft
A10157 niner.
Approaching from 100 miles
due south.
Requesting landing
instructions.
Glipswick tower to
Beach Craft,
please stand by.
lt's a Hercules military
transport.
That's strange. lt doesn't
have any markings on it.
lt looks like he's
going to land.
He's coming in on 16.
Make sure that the runway
is clear
and Pete, would you declare
an emergency please?
Attention ground crew!
Emergency landing runway 16
Repeat. Emergency landing.
Runway 16.
Hey you. Up there!
Who are you?
Where's the pilot?
Harry here.
Nobody inside answers.
What the hell's going on?
l don't know.
What do you think?
Let's see.
What's the story?
Nobody answers, Sir.
You inside!
Open the door and come out
with your hands in the air!
This is Commander Davidson
of the Airport Security
Police.
You are surrounded in
the name of the law.
l order you to come out.
You have just thirty seconds
to make up your minds.
Watch it!
The door's opening!
lt's Professor Hagenbeck.
l don't believe it.
My god!
Let's get out of here
Go...
lnterrupt the program.
We're transmitting
a special newsflash.
Does the chief
know about it?
There's no time to tell him.
Am l in charge of
the broadcast or not?
Whatever you say, Massa..
Your wish is my command.
Wake up Terry.
Drop your powder puff girl
and announce Miller and
a special news flash.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Your attention please.
We are interrupting
our transmission of
"lt's All Music" for a
special news flash.
At the end of the newsflash
we'll return with our
regular program. Thank you.
Oh shit! Just when l was
gonna do my first close up.
Oh, shut up, will you?
l want to listen to it.
At 1 1 o'clock this morning,
an event without precedent
took place at the airport
of this city.
An airplane of
no nationality landed on
the south runway
of the airport.
lgnoring all instructions
from the control tower.
The airport police
immediately converged
in the scene of
the unauthorized landing,
surrounding the aircraft
and ordering...
Yes sir. l told him that.
Right away chief.
..the order had
absolutely no effect.
What the hell are
you doing?
Why did you interrupt
my broadcast?
Now don't get mad at me.
lt's not my fault.
The chief rang down.
Albert. What the hell
is going on here?
They're UFO's.
lt's bound to happen
sooner or later.
You've read too many
comic books.
You can say what
you want but
l'm not going home
alone tonight.
You can sleep at my house,
l'll protect you.
Yeah, who's gonna protect
me from him?
Will you all shut up!
We're back on the air in
20 seconds, come on.
ls it possible that you're
not aware of the trouble
that broadcast
could have stirred up?
Or the uproar that would
have followed it?
l'm well aware of that
General Merchenson.
But l'm a journalist and
my job is to keep
the public informed.
Mr. Miller
listen to me very carefully
Something very serious has
happened at the airport.
But until we conclude our
investigation, and take
the necessary counter
measures, nothing is
going to leak out. Nothing.
The defense department
has strictly forbidden it.
l don't give a damn about
the defense department.
ln a democratic country
nobody is allowed to
interfere with the freedom
of the press,
for any reason whatsoever.
l see. Mr. Desmond.
As the person in charge of
this station, you will be
held directly responsible
for the dissemination of
any tendentious news.
l'm sure you realize
what you're risking.
Don't worry.
We won't transmit anything
without your authorization.
Thank you.
Good morning.
l'm fed up with you Miller.
l'm suspending you
from all duties.
No you're not. l quit!
Okay.
l'll take care of
it first thing.
Excuse me honey. Sorry.
Hello?
Hello, Liz?
ls my wife there?
She just went out.
Just this minute.
Call her back immediately!
Yes. Yes sir. Of course.
Mrs. Miller!
l am sorry, sir.
But l missed her.
But you'll be able to
reach her at the hospital
in half an hour.
She said she wasn't
feeling well today.
She was going to stay home.
l don't know.
Maybe she changed
her mind.
Okay Liz.
Okay.
Please don't answer.
lt'll stop.
This is your day off.
Yes.
Agent Warren Holmes?
Speaking.
This is civil defense
headquarters
General Merchenson would
like you to come down
here right away.
Why? What's up?
The general will explain
everything to you himself.
Come right over.
The drill is maximum
urgency.
l'm sorry my love.
We'll finish our
conversation later.
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?
No, on the contrary.
Every time l look at it
l get a feeling of...
Of death?
ls that what you were
going to say?
lt's funny.
lt's the first time one of
your works have given
me a feeling like that.
lt's the truth.
l'm sorry.
l can't say that
you are wrong.
When l look at it,
objectively... l mean
when l'm not actually
working on it.
l almost get the feeling
that l wasn't the one
who made it.
But some other being
outside of me.
lt frightens me.
That sounds like
science fiction.
Metaphysics if you want.
lt's better if we don't
take it too seriously.
l'll junk it if you like.
No. Don't even think of it.
Can you imagine what
the world would have lost
if Michelangelo destroyed
his works at the request of
Major Warren Holmes?
But l'm not Michelangelo.
To me my love,
you're much more.
Wake up Major.
lf not you're never going
to get to work.
Camera one.
Move out from her waist
and hold on it.
On two. Hit it!
Holy shit!
What the hell is going
on down there?
Civil defense?
This is Channel 5
TV station.
We're being attacked!
For God's sakes!
Send somebody fast!
Get out of here!
Hi Louise.
Well how are you
felling today Phil?
Horrible.
l feel like somebody
the hatchet guy is
waiting for to chop
off his head.
Well, that sounds like
an improvement
over yesterday.
Temperature?
Normal doctor.
Continue with antibiotics
every eight hours.
Well. lf it isn't my
favorite patient.
Hi, Jim.
How are you feeling today?
l feel a lot better,
but l can't play soccer yet.
You've got a couple more
weeks and that's it.
Before you know it
you're going to be running
up and down that
soccer field making one
goal after another really.
Dr. Kramer is
the best there is.
ls that the truth?
The truth.
Last night l had
this nightmare.
lt was all about my leg.
There was this big
explosion, it was right
here in the hospital.
My leg got cut off.
Well we don't have to
worry over that any more.
Your legs gonna be just fine
The truth.
Well okay.
l'll stop by and see
you later.
Our latest report shows
the presence of attackers
here, here, and here.
This enables us to determiine
a presumed line of march
from the airport
to the city limits.
Their quite definitely in
a north eastern direction.
We don't know if
this indicates a
pre-determined plan,
but we must react
as though it did.
We have no other choice.
Unfortunately,
the reports coming in
from our various
information centers,
the latest from the National
Science Academy, are
all rather sketchy.
But they do suggest, even
in a vague way, the type of
counter measure to adopt.
You may proceed.
This is the body of one
of the attackers.
lt was picked up on
the runway at the airport.
The autopsy categorically
excludes an
extraterrestrial being.
His molecular structure
clearly establish him as
a member of
the human race.
A paradox when you
consider what they've
been doing.
Colonel, please.
l am Colonel Donahue
from the institute of
atomic research.
The examination of various
tissue samples that we
have taken from the body,
reveal the presence of a
high degree of radioactivity
far superior to the level
normally tolerated by
the human organism.
ln addition, we have
found more or less recent
hyper tissue regeneration.
Can you make that a little
simpler, Colonel.
Some of your colleagues
may not have the same
theoretical or technical
background.
ln other words, this
individual and others like
him, have been subjected
to strong doses of atomic
radiation which increases
their physical capacities
beyond the norm.
How far beyond the norm?
That's difficult to say.
But it's a fact that these
cells subjected to every
treatment we know have
turned out to be almost
indestructible.
ln short it's a kind
of a superman.
Much more than that.
What do you mean?
l mean that at the abnormal
strengthening of the cells
vital quality has
increased their direct
genetic capacity.
ln other words, Major,
the victims of these
creatures are contaminated,
even if they only suffer
minor injuries.
Then they can reproduce
themselves, say indefinitely
That more or less, Major,
is correct.
And you say with our
weapons that they cannot
be destroyed.
No. That their
substance can't.
Excuse me Colonel.
lsn't that the same thing?
Not exactly. A machine may
be indestructible, yet its
functioning may still
be blocked.
By interrupting the feeding
process for example,atomic
contamination destroys
the efficiency of
red blood cells
in very short order.
That is why new blood
is always needed.
For these creatures
tthe human organism i
greatly strengthen.
However, the power still
remains in the brain.
A lesion to the nerve center
can produce paralysis.
The procedure stops
the complex entirely.
You mean that only bullets
damaging the cranium can
stop these monsters?
This corpse is the proof.
lt's the only lifeless body
we have recovered.
The cranial apparatus has
been destroyed.
Thank you, Colonel.
Lieutenant Reedman,
you've heard everything.
The order to every soldier
and police officer is
aim for the brain.
We must be very specific
about that.
As for our combat plan,
we'll follow emergency
plan H and keep plan B
in reserve in case
the situation gets
out of hand.
That's all for the moment
gentlemen. Thank you.
Oh Warren?
l have to talk to you.
Excuse me General.
May l make a phone call?
Alright but hurry it up.
Yes sir. Thank you sir.
l'm trying to reach
him now, sir.
Yes sir. Hold on please.
Hello. Sheila?
Oh, it's you Warren.
l was in the bathroom
doing my hair.
l want to look nice
for you this evening.
l'm afraid that
this evening is out
of the question.
Can you tell
me why Warren?
l can't explain it now.
l was looking forward to...
My darling listen
l want you to do exactly
as l tell you.
Understand?
Perfectly.
l will do what you wish
and not ask why
a typical male
chauvinist pig attitude.
Sheila this is serious.
Don't kid around.
l want you to make sure
all doors and windows
are locked.
Nobody is to be
let in!
Nobody, understand?
l'll be home as soon
as l can.
And when l get there
you make damn sure it's me.
Clear?
Yeah. Transparent.
Have you become insanely
jealous all of a sudden?
Think whatever you
want to think.
But for God's sake, Sheila.
Do what l tell you...
Okay
City Poly Clinic.
May l help you?
Wiill you hold
the line please
Dr. Miller is
wanted on the phone.
lt's for you Dr. Miller.
lt's your husband.
Tell him l'm very busy.
He can call again later.
l'm sorry sir.
But Dr. Miller is
about to go into
the operating room.
Please would you call
back again later?
l must speak with
her now! lt's urgent!
Can't you just...
l'm sorry sir, but l
can't disturb her now.
l see. Thank you.
Jessica, what are you doing?
We're supposed to be
leaving for the weekend.
l know. l know.
ls the camper all packed?
All packed and filled
up with gas.
Now who could that be?
Oh well.
Okay. l'll get it.
No.Leave it.
Don't answer it.
lt's probably some bore.
Or maybe your father
who always wants to know,
where we're going and if
we have enough money.
Oh, didn't you know?
Generals are fussy and
General Merchenson is
no exception.
l really don't know why l
married Jessica Merchenson.
lt isn't even three months
and already you repent?
l'm a pacifist.
You know l hate uniforms.
Good morning madam.
Your father wishes you
to join him immediately
at headquarters.
He does?
At headquarters?
Why?
l have no idea.
He tried to phone you but
there wasn't any answer.
He says that you're not
to waste any time.
l have a car outside.
Why?
Did something
serious happen?
Your father will explain
everything to you.
Maybe some kind of
war broke out.
Okay. You can wait
for us in the car.
Headquarters 79.
Hello. May l talk to
General Merchenson?
lt's his daughter speaking.
Yes ma'am.
Will you hold the
line please?
l'll try to locate him.
The line was cut off.
Listen. lt's dead.
Why don't we just
clear out of here
l don't like spending my
weekend with a General.
lt's probably not important.
l could call him from a
telephone booth.
Come on. Hurry up.
We have to sneak out,
so that idiot outside
doesn't realize anything.
Okay? Let's go.
Give me your hand.
Dr. Miller, please.
l'm her husband.
Oh, l'm sorry.
Dr. Miller is in
the operating room.
She's assisting Dr.Kramer
in a very delicate operation
and we have strict order
not to disturb her.
But l must see her.
l can't wait.
Sorry Mr. Miller,
orders are orders.
Dr. Schreiber,
Dr. Schreiber, Please.
We have an emergency in
the outpatient department.
Dr. Schreiber.
What the devil's
going on today?
You know, that's the sixth
emergency in two hours.
Alright. Alright.
l'll be right down.
Hold your socks on.
Raise it up.
lt's Whitey, let him in.
Come on.
Come on Whitey, why are
you standing there?
Hey, what's happening here?
Unfortunately they've just
sabotaged the south power
station as well.
We have a team of
engineers there, but
this will take hours before
they can get working again.
With luck.
Well, the lines are
still down.
There's orders to bring your
daughter and son in law
back here to headquarters.
General Merchenson.
Gentlemen. The government
insists that we not
dramatize the situation or
leak any news that might
cause public disorder.
We can't conceal this
from the public.
Why... lt's absurd.
The government disagrees
We'll just have to try to
keep control of public
buildings, barracks,
hospitals as long
as we can.
After which.
we'll be completely
on our own.
You're right Warren.
We'll simply have to
declare a state of
emergency ourselves.
Dr. Peterson!
They're coming
in like flies.
Come on.
We need all the help
we can get.
Hold that light up a
little higher miss.
Thank you.
What the devil are
they up to those fools?
Why haven't they turned on
the emergency generators?
Two of the generators are
out of order Doctor.
They are starting
up the third
lt'll provide just enough
current for us and
the emergency ward.
Have you checked
the pulse rate, Anna?
Yes, Doctor.
Weak but regular.
Very well.
Continue with
the direct oxygen.
Keep the light steady.
Ah, it's about time.
lt's running low Doctor!
What? Yes.
Anna would you please take
care of that and hurry.
Yes Doctor.
Help... help...
Somebody help us
There you are.
Oh my god. l can't breath.
l think l'm going to faint.
Why doesn't somebody
do something?
Hey out there!
Open up this door will you
come on
Help... somebody help...
Oh please god. Help me!
Help... help
Anna... Anna
Where are you?
lt's me Anna.
Don't be afraid.
Oh my god it's you.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Oh Dean. There's something.
lt's terrible. lt's horrible
You can't imagine
Yes, l know. Anna. Come.
Have they gone crazy?
Jason do something.
Make them keep quiet.
Keep still. Don't move.
Let's try to
reach the stairs.
Now...
Get us out of here...
My heart feels like
it's bursting.
Why don't they hear us?
Somebody help us...
Please... somebody
Let's not panic.
lf we keep calm then we
can all breath a lot easier.
The shaft has a lot of air.
Why doesn't somebody
do something?
These things have manual
controls on them.
Why don't they
wind us down?
You're right...
Hey, wind us down!
Hey somebody...
Wind us down... Help
Somebody help me please...
lt's alright. Be calm.
We're falling. We're falling
Get back.
We're gonna be alright now!
Oh my god.
Quick, the ambulance
Behind you... Lookout...
Hey George.
How about taking us
down a little. Okay.
Air force 7 to base 2.
Air force 7 to base 2.
We're at coordinate B.
So far we've had no trace
of invaders on this side.
lt's only an ambulance
heading out of town.
l'll continue on re-con.
Any news of your family?
No. None.
l only hope
they're alright.
l'm sorry Merchenson.
l really am.
Thank you
Well, the situation
is hopeless.
Many parts of the country
are cut off.
Most telephone lines
are out.
What's worse,
we've lost contact with
government headquarters.
We'll have to declare
a state of emergency
ourselves.
But you realize...
l'm fully aware of
the consequences.
l just see no alternative.
l understand.
What are you orders?
Please notify bases 1 12
and 401 to stand by with
helicopters and if
necessary, squadrons of
fighter bombers.
We've got to get
control back at once.
Before it is too late.
Or before we have all
become contaminated
just like them.
"... has declared a
state of martial law.
All civilians have been
ordered to remain in
their houses or to
place themselves under
direct protection of
the police or the military.
Private traffic may
circulate but only
if authorized..."
lt's frightening.
How could a thing
like this happen?
lt's part of the vital
cycle of the human race.
Create and obliterate
until we destroy
Words!
We're up against a race
of monsters.
Created by other monsters
who have only one thing on
their mind, the discovery
of greater power.
At least this time there
won't be any historical
justification.
Even if any of us survive.
Do you think it's
possible to stop them?
The infection is like an
oil stain and who knows
how far the contagion
has spread now.
"With the grave danger
of contamination all
public buildings and
private enterprises
will remain closed for
an indefinite time.
Weekend vacationers are
ordered to report
immediately to the nearest
police station or
military installation.
The civil defense
authorities have declared
a state of emergency.
They have further stated..."
Jessica. Stop that humming,
will you?
lt makes me nervous.
What's wrong?
What on earth
is the matter?
l just heard a news flash
on the radio.
Something serious has
happened in town.
They've declared a
state of emergency.
A state of emergency?
Are they crazy?
No. l don't know.
lt's difficult to
understand, but we
should go back to town.
But we just arrived.
l have no intention of
giving up my weekend.
To hell with the soldiers!
Listen, you're my wife
and l love you and l
don't want anything
to happen to you.
So it's better we go
away from here.
Something doesn't feel
very right.
Like what?
Like that continuous
barking, but l haven't
seen a dog around and
we haven't seen a car
since we got here.
ln a place like this.
Look at the road Jessica.
Usually there's
heavy traffic.
lt's all very strange.
Listen, it's almost 10,
but John should
arrive soon.
Let's talk with him.
They should know
what's happened in town.
Okay.
Bob...
My god.
lt's horrible.
What do you think happened?
There they are!
Martha, Martha...
Oh, are we glad you
are here.
You can't imagine what's
been going on.
First Bob heard this
news flash and...
Say. What's going on?
You two... Hey!
What are you doing
with that gun?
Sheila... Sheila...
Open the door
Please Sheila...
Sheila, it's me Cindy
let me in please!
Sheila, can you hear me?
For god's sake, Sheila!
Open the door!
Sheila. Thank heavens
l found you.
l just couldn't stand
it any more, being in
the house all alone.
Come into the front room.
Johnny went off to work
and the cleaning lady
never showed up.
l kept hearing noises
everywhere.
On the roof.
ln the cellar. Everywhere.
Well, you can relax
We're safe here.
At least for the moment.
Warren is coming as
soon as he can.
My god, Sheila!
What's going on?
l don't know.
l really don't know.
Have you tried
calling Gracie?
Her husband is with
the department of...
something or other.
How can l call?
The phone hasn't been
working for three hours.
Are you sure?
lt's not working
here either.
There must be a breakdown
at the exchange.
Cheer up.
Drink this.
l'm frightened Sheila.
Really frightened.
On the radio they said
to stay home and lock
all the doors and windows.
l did it.
l even barricaded
the crawl hole
to the cellar.
What did you say?
That l barricaded
the crawl hole
to the cellar.
How did l manage to
forget that?
Wait Sheila!
Don't leave me alone!
l'll come with you!
Thanks for reminding me.
Be quiet.
Light a candle and
stay down here
Sheila...
Sheila
Sheila...
They weren't even
curious.
We have a red cross
protecting us.
What is it dear?
Damn. We're running
out of gas.
There.
Anybody here?
Anna? You can get out.
There's nobody here.
Looks like they left
a while ago.
What do you think
about this?
lt's not really you.
But it's better
than that.
Just like a western.
Except that they didn't
have instant coffee in
the good old days.
Another advantage of
civilization my dear.
Like Coca-cola or
nuclear energy.
We'd be a whole lot
healthier without
all that stuff.
This is good.
Do you think we should
give up the advantages
that we have gained?
Maybe it would be better.
However it is not
the fault of science
and technology,
but of man.
Nature's own
human element.
We haven't reached
the age of the robot yet.
This mess could have
been avoided.
Yes, but for how long?
l don't know.
But one thing is clear,
we're partly to
blame ourselves.
Just think of the life
we have led up until
Shut up in those
ridiculous cities
in a steel and
concrete jungle,
like machines.
All this had to happen
to realize the truth.
Let's hope it isn't
too late.
"... have special commando
units positioned at all
strategic points in and
around the city,
according to the latest
reports from the civil
defense headquarters.
Public buildings, offices,
and businesses alike
have been ravaged and
damages are estimated in
the hundreds of thousands.
General Hospital has been
hit the hardest.
Many have been seriously
injured and hundreds of
lives have been lost with
the end still not in sight.
General Merchenson,
commanding officer of
civil defense..."
lt's better we start moving
Get all the provisions
you can from the back room
l'll get the gas.
Dean...
They're here...
Outside. l saw them.
Dean. l saw them!
lt won't hold
them for long.
Find something.
Something like cotton.
Here.
Perfect.
Let's hope this works.
They're all together.
When l say "now",
you open the door.
Okay?
But Dean, l can't
- Listen...
Do what l say
Don't argue
- Alright
Now!
Let's go.
Do you want some more?
Don't give in.
