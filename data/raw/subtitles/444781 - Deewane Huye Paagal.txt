welcome friends!
I'm here to narrate to you...
...a fantastic story
whose essence is love.
Friends, let me tell
you such a story...
...in which the impossible
becomes possible...
...in which a King finds his lost
queen and an old man, his youth.
There was a scientist
by the name Khurana...
...who was a little forgetful
and a bit crazy.
For 25 years he worKed on a formula
that restores youth to the old.
EureKa! Found it!
One drop of this will maKe
a person younger by 25 years.
Let us see a live demonstration...
how Khurana's formula has
done the unimaginable!
One drop of this will
KnocK 25 years off.
A ducK will become the
egg that it once was.
Khurana has only two confidants
who Knew his secret.
One, his secretary Kavita,
and the other, a talKing parrot.
The duty of the talKing parrot was...
...to remind the forgetful
Khurana his every worK.
But the secretary Kavita
proved to be a traitor.
Khurana wanted to gift his
formula to the Indian government.
But Kavita schemed to leaK
it to Khurana's twin, a mafia don.
What? My son, Baljit!
Baljit, the don's eldest son,
is corrupt and utterly selfish.
Dad, this is the day that
I've been waiting for.
Now on we will deal not in
billions but in trillions.
Shut up! I shall not
give it to anyone...
...whatever be the amount offered.
Only I will use the
formula and become young.
What foolishness is this, dad?
I am not being foolish.
Good morning dad.
Now meet his second son.
He is Sunny, whose genes seem
to have got jumbled up.
Today my love and life
Tanya is going to perform.
That's why I am going early to college.
Wish me good lucK.
You fool, learn to speaK
your language properly.
Don always had a suspicion that Sunny...
...is not his own son.
He carried a notion...
...that his second wife wanted
to confess on her deathbed...
...that Sunny happened
because of her affair...
...with her neighbour Subramaniam.
Baljit deceived his father.
And offered to sell the
formula to a Chinese gang.
The gang gave him an
advance of 50 crores...
...and told Baljit to give
them the formula in 3 days.
Now let us put the formula
and these plots aside...
...and come to the love story.
He studies in the college
and worKs in a canteen too.
A simple-minded lad
by the name Karan...
...with no one to call his own.
Murugan, who too worKs
in the canteen, is his only Kin.
Give this burger,
these pastries and this sandwich...
...to that fat girl sitting outside.
That fat girl eats a lot.
But we earn our living
only because she does that.
Said it right,
your honesty is your undoing.
Who is the best guy
in the college? - Sunny.
And who is most beautiful girl?
- Tanya.
The South Indian problem
of a North Indian father!
Sunny, Tanya's show is about
to begin. Come fast.
SpeaK softly.
Otherwise everyone will
turn up at her show.
Did you see that?
C'mon guys let's go for the show.
Not just Sunny but the entire
college is obsessed with Tanya.
Karan too loves her...
within himself...
Don't you want to
go to Tanya's show?
No
You liKe her a lot, don't you?
Yes. - Let's go.
How can I when she and
I don't Know each other?
I worK in this in small canteen.
But the entire college
is mad after her.
She doesn't even Know my name.
How can she...
till you get to Know each other.
C'mon now. - No, Murugan.
Let's go.

KILLER JEANS singer of the year award
goes to Tanya Moolchandani.
C'mon people,
lets give her a big hand.
TaKe this.
- Give my goggles bacK!
Somebody please help me.
They've taKen my goggles.
Leave him... leave him...
what are you doing?
We are playing the goggle
game. Want to join?
It is not good to
trouble someone liKe this.
Who are you? Are you the
brother of this mad guy?
Are you his brother?
Tell me, burger...
Is he your brother?
Is this mad guy your brother?
He is my brother.
Sister, he snatched my goggles.
He is being rough with me...
he is a rogue.
This one is a good guy.
Tanya, sorry. We didn't Know
that he is your brother.
Thousand apologies,
Here, taKe these glares.
Shut up! Just get out of here!
But, Tanya...
- I said get out.
OKay, I'll see you later.
C'mon boys, she really loves me.
How did you come out of the house?
From the rear window.
Because I couldn't trace my cycle.
Golu, how many times
should I tell you...
...not to come alone out
of the house liKe this?
Sorry, sis. - It's oKay.
Say thanKs to Karan.
ThanKs, Karan.
Do you Know my name?
I also Know that you came
last in the first year exam.
Just Kidding! You are a scholar
and... along with the studies you
...worK in the canteen
for your expenses too.
This is how the friendship started.
Karan wanted it to bloom.
What better chance than
a private Birthday bash!
He invited her and
Tanya too obliged.
A green signal from her side!
He cooKed delicious food,
lit the candle and waited...
He bought new pants and shirts.
Tanya too did some birthday
shopping for Karan.
Their hearts were
just about to unite...
...when villains played spoilsport.
The scientist locKed
the formula in a closet...
...told its code to his parrot...
and forgot it!
Baljit came to his uncle
to cheat him off his formula.
But the scientist tricKed Baljit
and ran away with his parrot.
Baljit then saw how things stood.
The formula in the locKer...
...and it's code with
the talKing parrot.
Baljit tooK his men and
went looKing for the scientist.
Open the door.
Who are you?
Get out of my vehicle.
What were you doing in it?
The scientist then saw
what fell out of Tanya's purse.
She left something behind.
When he saw it up close...
...it was Tanya's credit
card with her name on it.
Tanya felt sorry a little later.
A man is in trouble,
why shouldn't I go to help him.
Well, she turned her car
to go bacK to him...
...and was aghast to see
the scene ahead of her.
Baljit saw the girl...
...and realized that
a horrible thing happened.
The girl saw him committing the murder...
...and she must be caught
before she lets it out.
He saw the credit card in
the scientist's hand...
...and understood that the parrot
was with a certain Tanya.
Now I have to catch
two girls in one night.
One who has the parrot and another,
who saw the murder.
We must find the parrot.
Go and search for it.
When Baljit saw Tanya's photo,
he felt relieved.
The two girls he wants are
in fact one and the same!
Tanya ran to a police station...
...but the enemy was already there.
Tanya secretly overheard
their conversation...
...and realized that she has to
flee from her home that very night.
Karan waited and waited no end...
...but Tanya did not turn up that night.
Karan went to Tanya's house
to inquire after her.
Karan, who was unaware of
the sinister plot of murder...
...went to Tanya's house
but couldn't meet her.
Tanya had already left with
her brother Golu in darK...
...leaving Karan's love
story high and dry.
Later Karan searched
everywhere he could...
...but couldn't trace Tanya.
She just vanished in thin air!
In this way the lovers parted ways.
See for yourself if they will
ever come together again.
Hey, what happened?
Any succees with the locKer?
It is 3 years now...
but they are still clueless about its code.
The fruit is within reach
but I can't have it!
Hey, Baljit!
Why are you gaping liKe that?
Search for that parrot and bring it.
You have been searching for
the parrot for the last 3 years.
Get my Tanya for me and
I will give you a grandson.
Get lost, idiot!
Go and get it... or don't
show me your dirty face again.
You have come very late...
- OKay...
what is this!? A bill though
I didn't eat anything!?
Excuse me, here is your food...
that bill is mine.
'Experience the joy in giving a bill! '
You are mixing up your sandwich...
...with your bill.
Are you out of your mind.
I'm sorry. I got carried away a bit.
A bit!? You have lost
yourself since three years.
You have ruined your
life thinKing about Tanya.
Such a young and handsome guy you are!
Tell me and I will get you
not one but ten girls.
But none liKe Tanya.
And none is as smitten
by love as you!
Now taKe this bill and give
it at the correct table.
Excuse me!
Sorry... I thinK you are from
City College, right? - Yes.
And you are Karan. - Yes.
He's at it again! He's been
doing it since 3 years.
Inquiring all those who come
here, about Tanya.
You are Tanya's friends,
aren't you? - Yes.
Do you Know where Tanya
stays at present?
Yes. Tanya went to stay at
her aunt's place in Delhi.
So... Tanya is in Delhi.
No, she was in Delhi
two years ago.
But now she settled
with her aunt in Dubai.
In Dubai!
Do you Know her address in Dubai?
No, we don't. Sorry.
ThanKs.
We are going to Dubai.
- What!?
Let's leave all this.
Tanya is in Dubai. Let's go there.
Is Dubai in the next street
for us to go there in a jiffy?
Do you have a passport?
- No, but I have a ration card.
You get ration and not flight
ticKets with a ration card.
But one can get a passport
with the ration card... what now?
Do you Know that it taKes
15 odd days to get a passport?
Besides, Dubai is a huge city.
How will you find Tanya there?
Three years have passed.
Isn't it possible...
...that someone else
entered her life?
Come what may, even if it
means that I have to spend...
...all my earnings,
I want to meet Tanya just once.
OKay, by the time that
we get our passport and visa...
...I will get Tanya's Dubai address.
How will you do that?
I have a friend who
imports items from Dubai...
...and sells them here.
He has very good contacts there.
He can help us.
- Where can we find him?

Nana, what brings you
here so suddenly?
What else? I want money.
If you don't return my money today,
I'll cut your throat.
Hey, man! - Who is that?
Let him go. He doesn't have
another throat to spare.
Leave him. Come here, brother.
Who are you and what
worK do you have here?
What can you do to me?
Not me... all of us will do it.
Well... who are your men?
Do you want to checK out?
Kaliya, come here.
Does that bring you down to earth?
I am not afraid of you.
I am indebted to him.
I am ready to taKe the blows.
Raise the staKes one to ten.
Hey, play the music he liKes!
Kutty, your man is a goner today...

C'mon... into the ring!

Fifty-fifty. Fair enough,

Happy? - Very happy.
No cheating. - No.
If you feel cheated then taKe

No, you are great.
Brother Kutty! - Brother Murugan?
TaKe this...
welcome... - How are you?
Doing fine?
He is Karan.
The one I told you about...
...who wants to search
for his love in Dubai...
There is a man who is most
capable of doing that. - Who?
My name is RocKy.
You are Karan and he is Murugan.
You own a hotel but
go out and eat elsewhere.
He is younger and he,
elder... and are liKe brother and sister.
Brother and sister!?
- Want to Know anything more?
We want to Know about
Tanya and not about ourselves.
I can tell you not just
about Tanya but about her past...
...and future lives too.
Tell me what you want to Know.
We just want to Know about her present.
Is she a maid who stole
your money and ran away?
No, she stole his
heart and went off.
Oh, I see! It is a matter
related to the heart.
It will be 15 to 20 days
before we get our passports.
We want you to go ahead of us
and gather information...
...by the time we reach there.
Any problem?
I'll taKe 25000. - 25000!? - OKay.
That's just the advance.
Another 25000 after the worK is done.
50000!? We want
to Know only about Tanya...
...and not about the whole of Dubai!
Murugan, I am ready to pay.
And pay 50000 after you meet Tanya.
That'll settle it.
Oh my gosh! 100000 in all!
For that money, Tanya will herself
come here and give her address.
OKay, call her and taKe her address.
We don't need your help.
Let's find someone else.
You wait.
OKay then. - No, this isn't
how things are done.
I will give you one laKh rupees.
- One laKh!?
Fine. How can I identify her?
What is this? Does she looK liKe this?
No, not liKe this. - Then what should
I do with it, should I feed it chillies?
Should I sing a song?
Give me her photo.
- Sorry, I don't have that.
But I have her name...
Tanya Mirchandani.
Give this to her.
She may recognize it.
Will she recognize
this parrot? - Yes.
What a strange
love affair yours is!
OKay, I'll do your worK.
Dubai...
welcome to Dubai.
- Any progress in your worK?
Lots! It goes on rent
for 8 hours everyday.
The girl goes on rent!?
Oh, not the girl...
I'm talKing about my rental car business.
It's doing pretty well.
I am asKing about Tanya.
She has changed her name...
she is Natasha now.
I found this from the Indian embassy.
Here is her address.
You are quite fast at worK
these days. Very good.
Come on, let us go.
This bungalow is wonderful!
That's the one we want.
It has one balcony,
two windows and one main gate.
A tree too, though I don't Know
it's name... but I'll maKe a note.
Are you a broKer?
We came here to investigate...
...and not to deal
in real estate here.
Leave this and taKe this.
It is good that you
brought this baton along.
People here Keep a lot of dogs,
don't Know why.
This is a miKe and not a baton.
Shall I say something into it?
It's not for us to speaK
but to evesdrop on others.
Go in there.
I will stand here and listen.
Will you hear with this?!
I will see with this...
and hear with this.
Just go now! - OKay.
Natasha! - Here I come.
Turn it the other way!
Turn the miKe... not yourself!
Turn it the other way round.
Isn't Natasha sexy?
This Natasha is some joKe! - What!?
TaKe a looK.
You are right.
- She seems to be an old hand.
I thinK that this guy,
Karan, deals in old scrap.
Natasha!
Why is she calling out
to herself? - Don't Know.
Natasha! - What is it,
Ms. Sweety?
Why are you shouting?
Natasha seems to be a man!
What all did she change
along with her name!?
I am starting to doubt Karan.
It is getting late for
the shooting. Where is Natasha?
Ms. Sweety,
Natasha is in her room.
I'm sorry for the delay.
Only five more minutes.
Is she Natasha?
- Yes... I am dead sure.
Today is a great day for me.
Today is the shooting
of my video album.
Had you been with me,
my joy would have been even greater.
I miss you.
- We miss him too.
Why are you crying?
Why do you thinK that you are alone?
I am always with you.
Jayantilal and Tommy too
are with you. Isn't it?
C'mon fast. Or we will be
late for the shooting.
Start the car.
Forgive me brother,
I can't see.
I'm sorry. - It was my mistaKe.
Please forgive me.
It's oKay. Let me drop you.
Please forgive me.
I can't see at all.
Otherwise I'd not
have bumped into you.
Let's go fast.
- But brother, taKe this out.
Cut, cut, cut.
What are you doing here?
I'll go wherever Natasha goes.
I'll also dance.
Don't disturb the shooting. Later on,
you can dance as much as you want.
Let's go and sit there.
Let's go.
I'll be there in a moment.
Shut up!
Sorry, director.
The fact is that he was run over...
...by Natasha's car
and has become disabled.
He even lost his memory and
is living with us since then.
Boss, he's disabled.
He's just liKe her brother
who passed away. - What!?
It's none of our business.
He may be her distant relative.
Trying to eavesdrop?
Sanju!
Wow... Natasha,
you looK gorgeous.
Today is the first video
album of your career.
All the very best.
- ThanK you, Sanju.
Natasha, I want to tell you
something very important.
What's the matter?
- Let's go over there.
Why is she always surrounded
by invalids? - Now, who's this?
I don't Know. I've to find out.
Hold the miKe properly.
Why do you looK so worried?
Natasha, it is about
that friend of yours.
I learnt everything about him.
He's not only a drunKard,
but also a drug addict.
What? - Yes, he not only consumes
but also peddles drugs.
Oh, no.
Why can't I hear anything?
- Shall I go close to them?
Why don't you rather
give them the miKe!?
Just stay put.
- So... shouldn't I go?
Natasha, you must Keep away
from him... for my saKe.
Sanju, I can't believe it.
Even I couldn't
believe it initially.
Raj... how did all this happen?
TaKe this. Read this paper.
There's the police report in it.
O my God! ThanK you very much, Sanju.
I wouldn't have Known it,
but for you.
Madam, there's a call for you.
Cut, cut, cut it.
Hello Raj, I don't want
to talK to you again.
And I don't want to have
anything to do with you.
And from now onwards,
if you try to meet me...
Or if you try to call me...
...l'll complain against
you to the police.
Be strong! I'm with you.
Madam, the shot is ready.
Please come.
Go now. Your shot is ready.
I'll wait for you.
And Natasha, be strong. OKay?
Great! So... you wore
a new Kurta today.
This is not a Kurta.
It's a coat.
This is called a coat.
Buddy, these are pants.
These that you have on your
hand are pants. Very nice!
This is a tie. - This is not a tie,
it's a handKerchief.
What a weird man you are!
This... is a handKerchief.
But this is a vest.
- A vest is worn inside a shirt!
What one wears inside a
shirt are called socKs.
SocKs are worn inside shoes!
What we wear inside
shoes is called 'underwear'.
Underwear! LooK here...
this is what is called underwear.
What are you staring at?
It seems that your Knee
isn't worKing well.
Go and get it treated by a plumber.
By a plumber? - Careful...
or this blouse will get broKen!
Silence... silence please.
Move bacK! - Your Kurta looKs great!
I have to get some more
details about this girl.
No boss, we should get
more details about her.
What happened?
- Nothing.
Sometimes, I feel that
it is my mistaKe.
It's my fault.
Had I forced you...
...you'd have been
married by now.
Aunty, what's the point
in forcing someone?
Shouldn't one find
a worthy man for that?
You saw many guys.
What sort of guy do you want?
Good looKs and riches...
these don't matter.
But he should have a loving heart...
...and must do something creative.
LiKe... an architect.
And he should respect women too.
Even after all these years
aunty couldn't find a good guy.
But I am sure that you will
find such a man very soon.
What happened to your voice?
- What happened?
Why did you laugh liKe a man?
Aunty, I'm sure that some day
I'll get my dream boy.
Now, we're in Tanya's city.
Aren't you happy?
Are you happy? No?
No, Murugan. Till I see Tanya
with my very own eyes...
...I can't be happy.
No problem. Give me one hour.
We'll go to RocKy and taKe
Tanya's address from him...
...and from there we shall go to
Tanya's house.
Then you can see her and talK to her.
As much as you wish. Happy?
What's the problem?
How are you?
Come... come. Welcome to Dubai
please have a seat.
Sit down. - OK.
Congratulations. He was right.
He was right.
His heart was always right.
She is in Dubai.
How is she?
Beautiful. Her face is very beautiful.
Good. Very good...
But... - But?
She's expanded in all directions.
Expanded...!? Is she some Kind
of a blanKet or what?
She has become 132 Km!
132 Km?
I mean, she now weighs 132 Kg...
she just sits all the time.
Sits all the time!? Can't she walK?
How can a person walK on a wheelchair?
- On a wheelchair?
Isn't there any other chair in her house?
Why a wheelchair?
An accident is bound to happen
when one drinKs and drives.
Accident!? And did Tanya start boozing?
She normally never touched liquor.
But when angry, she would
gulp down a full bottle.
And that day she had a fight
with her husband.
Husband!? You mean...
Tanya got married?
Did I ever say that she is married?
Did I?
Actually, she is a widow.
In fact, she is a double widow.
Her first husband was very good.
His only vice was smoKing.
One day he was smoKing a cigarette
and it blew up.
Blew up!?
He was at a petrol pump
and it blew up.
And the second husband?
- He was liKe God.
He had no bad habits.
But he was forgetful.
One day, he got up from bed
and tooK his bath.
For his breaKfast he had
bread, jam, butter, cheese...
But he forgot the most important thing.
Bread? - No, his breath.
He forgot to breathe.
Because he had acute
breathing problem.
Both the husbands passed away...
...but I've seen how much
she loves her Kids.
Kids!? She has Kids too?
She has 6 healthy Kids.
Six Kids?
How can she have six Kids in three years?
Twins! A pair of twins each year.
You are right.
To raise them,
she worKs very hard at night.
WorKs at night?
Yes, she started a laundry
at her home.
She set up 4-5 machines.
She goes about on her wheelchair
and washes all the clothes.
Then she irons them. Don't asK
what all things that Mother India doesn't do.
She worKs hard for her seven Kids.
Seven? Just now, you said six Kids.
The sixth child is illegal.
Illegal?
It's from an underworld don's.
She married him too? - No. She didn't!
One day she burnt his suit.
The don forgave her.
And then the affair started.
Now both of you decide and tell me.
When should I booK the ticKets to India?
Let bygones be bygones.
Get him married to a nice girl in India.
Find a good bride for him.
Where's your luggage?
Aren't you coming to India?
Who will maKe the payment?
Defaulters are Killed here.
But, I'm not worried about the
payment you owe me.
Your payment... - No.
Your payment... - No.
TaKe your payment.
Are you mad? I can't taKe
money from a true lover.
Hey God! I shall never commit such a sin.
OKay, put it in here.
C'mon. Why have you landed here?
If we don't get a seat in the plane,
we'll have to travel standing.
No... I'll not go bacK.
What!? You'll not go to India?
However Tanya is in trouble right now.
She needs me more than ever.
And I can't leave her alone in this condition.
I'll not go bacK.
I bow to the greatness of your love.
Stay bacK. And I promise...
...when you meet Tanya after 3 years,
I'll cry a lot.
After three years!?
She went on her honeymoon last night.
She went to honeymoon alone?
Not alone. She went with that underwear.
Underwear?
Sorry, I mean the underworld don.
She went away with him for three years.
Such a long honeymoon! Three years!
When the Interpol chases
an underworld don...
...he needs to be on the run
for at least three years.
Three years! I won't stay here
for three years.
The three years will pass easily
in five years.
What is all this nonsense?
Don't confuse us. We're not mad.
Do we have oil wells here to
stay on for three years?
Who'll manage our business there?
Karan, let's go.
Stop there!
Let go!
Hold on. Go away!
Go away if you have to.
Good riddance!
Can I checK your passport?
How many pieces do you have?
- Two.
Your passport. - ThanK you.
Karan, Karan.
What's it?
Karan, will you go to India running?
The new van that came just now...
- Yes.
There's Tanya's poster on that van.
What?
Tanya is in Dubai. - What?
I found her, Murugan.
That means RocKy tooK
our money and cheated us!
No. I saw that poster and...
...the name was Natasha instead of Tanya.
That means Tanya changed her name.
And we've asKed RocKy
to search for Tanya.
That means whatever he said
was about some other Tanya.
OKay, but the van is gone.
Where will we looK for Tanya?
I saw the music company's name.
We'll get the address.
That won't be difficult.
No difficulty! No difficulty!
Where's the luggage?
The luggage has been put
on the flight to India.
Why don't you do
some shopping with us too?
What is this nuisance?
I'll call the police.
Leave me...
Hello buddy! - Who is that?
How far is the nearby hospital?
Do you want to get admitted?
No, I'm thinKing of admitting you people.
Excuse me, madam.
Please hold this. ThanK you.
Come on boy...
If it is far off, I will taKe you there
and breaK your bones.
Or do you want me to do it here?
What do you say?
How was it?
TaKe this. This is your 100.
Yours... and yours. You taKe 50.
Why only 50? What was my mistaKe?
They worKed so hard.
He broKe the bonnet and he, the glass.
He broKe a bottle on his head.
You didn't breaK even a mud pot.
You are not fit for this.
Sorry boss. I missed out this time.
Teach him or I will have to bash you all up.
You got hurt?
Just a minor scratch, but its oK.
But are you oKay?
Yeah, I'm absolutely oK.
Are you an architect?
How did you Know that?
I saw it...
You must have seen me in
Time magazine's cover story, last year.
No, it is written on your bag.
Sharp mind! - ThanK you.
By the way, I'm RocKy Hiranandani.
Natasha Mirchandani.
It is I who designed this global village.
Really? Wow!
I'm a gold medalist from Oxford Dictionary.
Excuse me!
Oxford university. What did you hear?
I'm sorry, I heard dictionary.
I'm really sorry.
I earned a lot of money and
now want to do something else.
I want to help the disabled,
mentally retarded and the blind.
Have you seen the movie 'BlacK'?
- Yeah, it was very touching.
Great! I financed it.
Really?
I gave all my white money in blacK.
Oh!
Come. I will drop you. What happened?
Wow, Ferrari!
Yes, this is my car, Ferrari. Please come.
Lovely car.
Isn't it lovely! Please, come.
No thanKs. I've my car. I'll go on it.
By the way, I stay nearby.
If you're free, let's have some coffee.
Let's go.
No. Not now.
No, I meant 6 pm. How can we go now?
This is my worK hour.
Someone is driving away your car...
Driver, come soon after having lunch.
A driver? I will go in a boat
what is your address?
Bungalow no. 13, Jumera Beach.
OKay, I'll see you there.
Nice to meet you. - Bye, bye!
Got it?
We are finished! It's Thursday today.
What if it is Thursday?
This is Dubai, man.
It is a holiday on Thursday and Friday.
We will Know about Tanya
when the shop opens on Saturday.
We are in trouble.
Murugan, this time I will trace
Tanya at any cost.
In these clothes?
After two days you won't be able to
recognize me.
How can Tanya recognize you?
Right buddy! Our luggage
has gone to India.
Let's do one thing. First of all,
let's buy some clothes.
Let's go. - C'mon.
These days there is no safety
even in the parKing lot.
Aunty, I wonder what would have happened,
if that guy hadn't come at the right time.
Right, and by the way, how does he looK?
Good looKing... handsome.
Handsome! He must be using
'Fair and Lovely'.
Shall I tell you one more thing?
He is a famous architect.
Architect? Whom are you talKing about?
They are talKing about you!
Am I an architect?
You fool! It is about me.
Even Raj pretended to be an architect,
but he was a drug addict
Aunty, please...
what 'please'?
She said something sensible
for the first time.
Aunty... we shouldn't
trust loafers liKe him.
He isn't a loafer.
Really!
I have asKed him to come here for coffee.
Here!?
It's alright. We'll get a
chance to examine him.
Jayantilal Knows who is good and who isn't.
If Jayantilal approves him, so have I.
You understood the situation? - Yes.
No, you didn't. Now,
we have to propitiate aunty.
Aunty! Have you changed the target?
How many people will you woo.
To woo Natasha, we have to
tacKle her aunty first.
And to do that, we have to
persuade Jayantilal.
Happy birthday to you!
Whose birthday?
Your birthday.
My birthday! It is not my birthday.
Weren't you born?
How did you Know that I was born?
Because I too was born.
And you were also born.
That means we are brothers by birth.
TaKe this. I brought flowers for you.
OKay, put them on that tree
and leave this place.
I will give you gifts daily,
after you become my brother-in-law.
But I don't have a sister.
You have two sisters inside.
And you are lying to me, Jayantilal.
Where is Jayantilal?
So you forgot your name also?
What is your name? - RocKy.
Is it oKay with you if I call you
MonKey, hocKey or TanKy?
Jayantilal!
Jayantilal! Is my tongue wagging?
- No.
Do I have a tail? - No.
Did I ever barK at you? - No.
Did you ever see me wetting the posts?
Hold on! Not till now.
Then, how can I be Jayantilal?
Because your name is Jayantilal.
So you really have the itch
to meet Jayantilal.
I will call him, right now.
It will give you a awful bite... Jayantilal.
Whom are you calling?
My dog.
What is your name?
Tommy.
Oh my God!
Who are you and what do you want?
Why do you come here always?
Why do you meet me always?
Because this house is mine.
Now, leave this place.
I am the future owner of this house.
Now, you leave this place.
I am the owner. Go away.
Your sister Natasha invited me.
You should go away.
She might have called you
to maKe you her brother.
She maKes every other man her brother.
I am the main one and
you are the 'other'. Get lost.
Go away from here.
TaKe a u-turn.
I will maKe your hand taKe the u-turn.
Tommy!
What are you doing?
How much will you beat me?
No. No! - Stop it.
Hi, RocKy. - Hi!
He is RocKy that I told you about.
Since my childhood, I Knew how to
Keep animals under control.
And the people, bacK where I lived,
used to call me TC.
TicKet ChecKer?
No, no. Trainer and Controller.
Wow, that's great.
By the way, she is Sweety, my aunty.
What? Is she your aunty?
I thought she is your sister?
ThanK you.
You have maintained
your physique very well.
ThanK you. By the way, are you married?
No. I am a bachelor.
Till now, I didn't find my Kind of girl.
Even she isn't married...
Go and get him.
Tommy, today we have to attend a program.
Go and get ready.
He taKes time to get ready.
If you are going somewhere,
I shall taKe your leave.
No, not now. In the evening.
Today, we are launching Natasha.
You are launching her?
Where is she going?
No, I mean we are going to
Natasha's music launch party.
You too come with us.
What? Music! Are you a singer?
Yes. - I love singers.
I mean, I love music. You Know,
music is my life. I just love music.
Please, taKe this.
What is the need for this?
This isn't a gift. This is yours.
Do you remember? That day when
there was a fight, your bracelet fell down.
It tooK me whole night to fix it.
TaKe it. Now, it is very strong.
Would you liKe some tea or coffee?
No. No tea or coffee for me.
I am too health conscious.
Really. Even Natasha doesn't
liKe tea or coffee.
Oh, that's very nice.
What a coincidence! Very nice.
Then...
But I drinK juice.
- I'll bring it in a moment.
Tell me something about your family.
Bitter Gourd. - Bitter Gourd?
AsK him to add Bitter Gourd in the juice.
Yes, sure. - You got it.
Jayantilal...
Do you have Ginger? - Yes.
Add that too in the juice.
Jayantilal!
Do you have spinach? - Yes.
Add that too in the juice.
Do you have Red pepper? - Yes.
Add that also in the juice.
It seems to be a very special juice.
OK girls, I am ready.
And the juice is also ready.
Why did you wrap
Jayantilal in the blanKet?
He was feeling very cold.
That' why I wrapped it on him...
...without your permission.
I hope you don't mind.
How sweet! - You are right.
Here is your juice.
Juice! Don't give him juice.
I will drinK that juice.
This juice is not for me.
This is for Tommy.
His hand will be restored
if he drinKs this juice.
Natasha looKs wonderful, isn't she?
ThanK you so much for coming.
I am so glad.
I can't tell you how well you sang.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Congratulations!
Madam, today your album

Your album is called 'Man Of My Dreams'.
Can you tell us who the man

He is India's no. 1 architect.
Are you also an architect?
Who else is an architect over here?
Actually Sanju is also an architect.
I see. You too are an architect?
Nice, very nice.
When will the program start?
From which university did you graduate?
That was in... - Oxford.
Yes, Oxford university.
Oxford! And what all
buildings did you design?
I built the Taj Mahal.
You built the Taj Mahal!?
But Sahjahan claims that
he built the Taj Mahal.
Hotel Taj Mahal in Mumbai.
You built the hotel Taj Mahal in Mumbai?
I didn't build the Taj Mahal hotel
in Mumbai...
...but next to it is a building
with a glass fa¢ade.
That means you also into...
- what? - Into glass business?
Excuse me. That glass building was
built by Oberoi brothers.
Absolutely right. Oberoi builders
did build that.
But I am the one who designed it.
But I put a condition that my name
should not be revealed.
And what else have you built?
Isn't it hot here?
They are asKing what else you built.
The AC is full.
Did you see the Red Fort?
Red Fort, nonsense.
If you have built the Red Fort,
then I have built the qutub Minar.
Why are you getting angry?
I was talKing about
Red Fort undergarments...
So, you also have
the business of undergarments? - No.
No. I built the factory
for the owner of that company.
And what else have you built?
I built parKing lots, parKs, entrances...
...toilets, and the plaster on their walls.
Should only I list my achievements
or will someone...
...asK him about his worK.
You say something.
This happens always. When two persons
of the same field meet, they speaK liKe that.
Ladies and Gentleman!
May I have your attention please.
- LooK boy, looK.
Come...
world Gold Council
and D'damas Gold
...presents you the most
sensational music album...
And now we also liKe to present, collection
G'gold jewellery to Natasha.
Are you happy, invalid?
Let's now watch Natasha
exclusively on zoom.
Watch this Munna.
Father, Tanya, Dubai.
Hey, son of Subramaniam,
why are you shouting?
I brought this Idli and Dosa for you.
And there are many more things
that you have to bring.
I searched a lot and found Tanya.
Tanya is in Dubai.
Dad, she is the girl that has the parrot.
You will definitely get married.
Let's go to Dubai.
My son, can you recognize her,
I mean my daughter-in-law?
I can recognize Tanya even
without looKing at her.
You fool! How can you recognize her
without looKing at her?
Uncle, you don't Know that his nose
is liKe that of a dog.
I can smell Tanya.
Don't worry dad.
She is in Dubai.
How can she escape from us?
Oh, you have a point.
Let's move forward.
We were supposed to come at 6.
Why did we come early?
If we hear them in advance...
...we will get to Know
what the girl has in mind.
TaKe out your baton quicKly.
That is not needed now.
I fitted a microphone in her bracelet.
What are you saying!?
Do you thinK that RocKy is coming
on a special purpose?
I don't Know.
Quiet...
what will you say if he proposes to you?
I don't Know.
But I Know that.
The aunty seems to be on our side.
I shall have a temple made for her.
Beggars are lining up even before the
temple is built. - What!?
What will he say after going in?
Natasha, I came here to say
something important. - Important!?
What is it?
Stay away from RocKy.
Why? What happened?
He is a fraud.
He is not an architect as he claims to be.
What are you saying!?
Yes, he is not an architect...
...or even a small time mason,
for that matter.
This bastard is putting braKes
in their relationship.
But he is invalid, isn't it?
I'm finished now.
I have checKed all Institutes fo
Architecture on the net.
RocKy's name isn't in any of them.
Why did he lie to me, then?
If you don't believe me,
I can give you the name...
...of that website from my dairy.
ChecK yourself.
Don't be sympathetic to me
because I am handicapped.
I found out his address too.
I will reveal the truth about him
in a day or two.
Everything will be oKay, boss.
I'll go and teach him a
lesson just now.
He is anyway going to
come here at 6 pm.
I cannot Keep quiet that long.
She is coming this way. Run!
Hey, let's drive off!
Boss, she has come.
Why did you tell her?
Why do you want to ruin my home?
Why do you want to ruin my home?
Why are you beating me up?
Why did you tell my mother?
- What?
That I am not an architect.
And that I am a captain in the Navy.
You don't Know that
my mother hates water and the sea.
Why does she hate it?
I'll tell you that.
What am I to say?
My father was the Captain
if the ship Samrat.
My elder brother was its Vice Captain.
When that ship sunK in the sea...
...both of them died.
My mother hates water from that day.
She wouldn't even let me
taKe a bath in my childhood.
I used to bathe secretly
at some neighbour's place.
But my father's blood runs thicK in me.
And the sea becKoned me one fine day.
But why did you tell my mother
that I am not an architect...
...and that I am a Captain in the Navy?
You've made me an orphan.
Who will love this forlorn child now?
Who will love me now?
Tell me from where I should get love.
Natasha, when did you come?
Babloo, why didn't you tell me
that she came?
You are so naive!
Natasha, I want to tell you that...
You need not say anything.
I heard it all.
You are not alone anymore from today.
How good-natured you are!
You are very Kind.
You are the one from whom
I'll get all my love.
Hello friends!
The second part has begun.
Karan's love is in danger.
Tanya fell into RocKy's trap.
Till now there was one love story,
but now we have two.
What will Karan do?
Even those goons are getting anxious.
They want the parrot.
Sunny wants to marry Tanya
and give Khurana a grandson.
Some people want the
girl and some want the code.
