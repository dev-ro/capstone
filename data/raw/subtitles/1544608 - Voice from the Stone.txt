(MALVINA SHUDDERS)
MALVINA: (FAINTLY)
Jakob. Are you there, Jakob?
Are you listening?
Jakob.
Jakob.
I'm here.
I'm right here.
Don't.
Shh, shh.
Be silent.
And hear me.
This is how it must be.
Another woman will come.
You will see.
There will be another.
You will know her
by the love she shows to you.
(GASPS)
Let the words you speak
be the words that
call me back to you.
Promise me.
Promise.
(GASPING)
(SOFTLY) Jakob.
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)
(SOBBING)
MALVINA:
I will always be your mother.
(CHURCH BELL TOLLS)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(WOMAN SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(GIRL SPEAKING ITALIAN)
No.
Carlotta.
Carlotta...
Arrivederci.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(CRYING)
WOMAN: (SPEAKING ENGLISH)
I hardly know the woman I see.
Her name is Verena.
She is alone.
She remembers all of them.
Every parting.
Her life is measured
out in goodbyes.
Each one harder than the last.
Enter La Rocciosa...
And the boy who wouldn't speak.
(LOCK OPENING)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(CLEARS THROAT)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)
My first language.
I have these from
previous employers.
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)
Did you live with each family?
Yes.
I find it helps in
understanding the child
to know the family.
And do you remain in
contact with these people?
When a child recovers, the family
will generally choose to forget.
You've no degree.
But they say you've a gift.
My skill comes
through experience,
and a certain, um, sensitivity.
Sensitivity.
Mmm.
You have no
children of your own.
No.
Hmm.
Your son.
He prefers English?
His mother.
My wife wanted him to speak it.
She died. There was an illness.
My son has not spoken since.
Seven months...
And 16 days.
Alessio will see you
to your room.
I would like to introduce
myself to your son.
You haven't told me his name.
I must say there
have been other nurses,
all of them as sure
of their talents as you.
My son's name is Jakob.
(STONE WHIRRING, CLATTERS)
Hello, Jakob.
My name is Verena,
and I'm going to be
staying here for a while.
I promise I'm not
like the others.
I'm much worse.
(STONE CLATTERS)
Please look at me, Jakob.
I'd like to help you.
Do you understand?
KLAUS: There's no point.
He won't even nod his head.
He won't write or draw...
Sing or laugh, mmm?
Smile...
(SOFTLY) Cry.
Grazie.
(FORK SCRAPING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
We'll begin our work
in the morning, Jakob.
Say 9:00?
Your questions are wasted.
Jakob doesn't need to answer me.
I think he understands that.
Enough.
(FORK CLATTERS)
Sit down.
Now you may go.
Good night, Jakob.
(LIGHTER CLICKS)
He is very obedient.
Hmm.
This is part of it.
To disobey is to say
something, so...
So he obeys.
He isn't trying to hurt you.
That's my son, signorina, not me.
Hmm.
Jakob doesn't want you here.
He hasn't shown
it yet, but he will.
There is such power
in his silence.
You will feel it.
You speak very harshly to him.
(POUNDS TABLE)
Braver than the others.
I have some things
I need to ask.
What things?
Tomorrow, perhaps.
(STONE WHIRRING)
(GASPS)
VERENA: To begin with,
I will tell you what I see.
I see...
That if you wanted
to speak, you could.
Hmm, and I see
how hard it must be
to truly say nothing.
How hard you must be
concentrating every moment.
And I must admit,
you're very good at it.
I know a little something of what it
feels to be apart from the world.
I lost my mother when I was a
little bit younger than you.
And my father when
I was a little bit older.
It's a lovely day.
I have an idea.
Jakob?
Jakob.
Buongiorno.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(SIGHS)
Grazie.
Jakob?
Jakob?
(DOOR OPENING)
Jakob?
(RATTLES DOOR HANDLE)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Oh.
(SPEAKING ENGLISH) Please, forgive me.
I didn't... Verena.
The nurse, of course.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Come closer. Come.
Let Lilia see you.
You've come to make
the boy talk.
Just to help if I can.
Oh, welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome to La
Rocciosa, my child.
Grazie.
You're very kind.
But I should go.
Yes, of course.
Go find the boy.
Make him talk.
(TOUCHING KEY SOFTLY)
(PLAYING KEYS)
(STOPS PLAYING)
I'm sorry. (STAMMERS)
I was looking for Jakob.
Do you play?
No, I, uh, never could.
This is your wife?
Yes.
What was her name?
You spent time with
Jakob this morning.
Yes. And did you
observe anything?
I need to understand
what he has been through.
Malvina.
Malvina Rivi.
You may have heard of her.
No.
That's Carnegie Hall.
She played all over the world,
in all the great halls,
for kings and queens,
presidents.
VERENA: She was
very beautiful.
Six months after that photograph
was taken, she was dead.
It began after our return.
It started as a simple fever
and it became like fire.
Each day, it consumed a little
bit more of her strength,
her beauty.
I had to leave to find help,
and Jakob stayed with her.
He and Lilia
nursed her together.
He wouldn't leave
his mother's side.
Hmm.
He has his mother's gift.
They would sit here and
play together for hours.
(SCOFFS)
He chooses not to speak?
Oh... Oh, this...
This must be that incredible
sensitivity of yours?
I mean, there is no injury?
No incapacity?
Something inside him
has been broken.
It is simply a refusal.
A denial.
As if, by this vigil,
he can undo what is done.
You're telling me he wants
his mother back, hmm?
Well, that's a... (CHUCKLES)
That's a revelation.
(GUNSHOT ECHOES)
(NECK SNAPS)
(PANTING) I've...
I've been looking
for you, Jakob.
I'm here to work,
not to play hide-and-seek.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
No.
(SPEAKING ENGLISH) I haven't
finished yet, Jakob.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(SILVERWARE SCRAPING)
You have a very beautiful home.
Thank you.
I do hope you'll be
comfortable here.
Once, Jakob,
I stayed with a family in Lucca.
Their house hadn't
been cleaned in years.
There were cockroaches
as big as your father's watch.
And once, I stayed
with a family in Piacenza.
I shared a room with the cook
who snored come un bufalo.
(CHUCKLES)
So, yes, I'm sure...
I will be very comfortable here.
In truth, I cannot think
of this place as my own.
My wife's family has lived
here for 1,200 years.
Mmm. I'm just a visitor.
Alessio's family has been
here for just as long.
The women work here
in the house.
The men, in the quarry.
The quarry?
Mmm.
It's where all this comes from,
the wealth of the family.
The stone was once
highly prized.
Was?
She allowed it to flood
at the beginning of the War.
Times were difficult
and she had her career.
No more need for the stone.
Jakob swims there.
He'll take you
there if you wish.
Yes.
I'd like that very much.
(GREETING IN ITALIAN)

(WATER SPLASHING)
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
LILIA:
(SPEAKING ENGLISH) Let me.
Per favore.
(SIGHS)
It's been so long.
I used to do this to her
every night of her life
since she was a tiny girl.
She began to perform
when she was 14.
She took me with her everywhere.
Nobody knew her as I did.
Knew her moods,
her needs.
Oh...
How I loved her.
(LILIA BREATHES DEEPLY)
(SCREAMS)
(WHIMPERS)
Jakob, was it you?
If it was, then all you've
done is tell me you're afraid.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Ja...
Jakob.
Jakob, what is it?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Jakob.
Ah!
What?
Jakob, no!
Wait! Wait!
(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
Jakob? What? Hey!
(GRUNTS)
(STRUGGLING)
Jakob.
Jakob, no.
Quiet. Quiet.
Be quiet. Be quiet.
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.
(STRUGGLING)
KLAUS: Quiet. Enough.
Stop!
VERENA: I should have
left him. He was...
He was by the wall
as if he was...
Listening.
Yes, I've seen him do it.
In his bedroom.
Also in the garden.
In the quarry.
I assume it's his
mother he hears
or thinks he hears.
It seems to give him comfort.
I should have been told.
It changes the situation.
It may indicate a far
more serious condition.
You don't believe
in such voices?
(ANGRILY) No.
(CALMLY) No, signore, I do not.
Nor do I.
Sometimes I wish I did.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Have you considered
taking him away from this place?
Yes, of course.
It was impossible.
It was as you saw last night.
He became a danger to
himself and to others.
Then he should be in hospital.
No, absolutely not.
No. (CHUCKLES)
Signore, I'm no longer sure
I can care for your son.
Why?
I have been misled about
what is required.
I must consider whether I
am properly qualified.
You're just like the others.
(SCOFFS)
I await your decision.
(WINGS FLUTTERING)
VERENA: Jakob.
Jakob!
Jakob!
(PANTING)
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)
(FLOOR TILE CLATTERS)
Help me down.
You scared me, Jakob.
But you've helped me
realize something.
I can't leave you.
I once knew a boy
who thought he could
hear his dead sister
through the teeth
of an old comb.
He would sit with it for hours,
listening and whispering
his secrets.
He was as sure of what
he heard as you are.
The mind is capable
of extraordinary things.
It is your mind that is
speaking to you, Jakob,
nothing else.
I'm not saying that...
That what you hear isn't real,
because anything we experience
is real in its own way,
but it's...
It's not what it pretends to be.
It's important
to understand that.
I want to hear you speak.
But I am not your enemy.
I care about you.
What is it?
You wish to leave?
(BEES BUZZING)

(GATE CREAKS)

you're afraid that if you speak,
the voice will cease.

We'll listen together.
I'll tell you what I hear.

It's strange,

One could imagine
almost anything.
But she's not there.
I want you to stop this.
The dead do not speak.
I know it, Jakob.
I know it well.
However hard we wish them to,
the dead remain silent.
Good night, Jakob.
(BREATHES SLOWLY)
(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)
(CLICKS PHONOGRAPH OFF)
Your father told me
you have her gift.
What would she say if she knew
you might never use it again?
She must have spoken
about the future
before she died,
about the wonderful things
that lie ahead for you.
Try to remember what she said.
And imagine what she might say
now if she could see you.
(STONE THUDS LIGHTLY)
(STONE WHIRRING)
Buongiorno.
Signore.
There's a story about that cat.
(CHUCKLES)
It was the custom amongst those
building houses such as this to...
To seal a cat within the walls
as a protection against evil.
A dead cat?
No.
Not dead.
That's horrible.
Of course.
I... I'm a fool
to speak lightly of it.
Forgive me.
Jakob will be waiting.
Yes.
(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)
VERENA:
Now, if you were to play,
it would mean only
what you wanted it to mean.
Play for me, Jakob.
Perhaps I was wrong earlier
when I spoke about your mother.
Perhaps your silence
wouldn't horrify her
as it does me.
It is said that a true performer
cares only for the love
of her audience.
(PLAYS PIANO NOTE)
Perhaps...
Your silence
is a fitting tribute.
(PLAYS PIANO NOTE)
More adoration
as she leaves the stage.
(PLAYS PIANO NOTE)
What are you telling me, Jakob?
That I'm wrong
or that I'm right?
You can't...
(BANGS KEYS)
I do it to help you, Jakob.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
LILIA: The boy
was upset today.
He's sick.
He needs help.
And he's breaking
his father's heart.
(LILIA SIGHS)
The boy
is all that matters.
He is the future.
Look at yourself,
how beautiful you are.
Give me your hands.
Oh...
They're strong,
like hers.
He will not speak to please you.
The boy will speak
when the time is right.
(SOFTLY) He's waiting.
But he's waited long enough.
Surely that is clear to anyone.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
When he speaks,
where will you go?
To the next place.
Oh...
Lonely child.

(DISTANT CLATTERING)
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
Oh...
I wondered if Jakob
was still here.
No.
May I see?
If you wish.
It's, uh, my wife.
She was the worst
possible model,
restless, complaining.
(CHUCKLES)
She was the worst
and also the best.
And this one?
I have not worked
in many months.
It was to be of her.
You cannot finish it,
so you abandoned it.
(EXHALES)
Perhaps, to see you work,
it would help Jakob.
Perhaps it would signify hope.
Yes.
Perhaps.
(HEART BEATING)
(FABRIC RIPPING)
(GRUNTS)
Hello?
Lilia?
(DISTANT THUDDING)
I keep it clean for her.
She was here at the end.
We nursed her day and night,
me and the boy.
He saw terrible things.
He heard terrible things.
(SIGHS)
And when she died,
I washed her...
And tidied her hair.
(SIGHS)
The room upsets you.
Oh, you've torn your dress.
Uh, yes.
Yes, I... I wondered if I
might borrow some thread.
Ah.
I have an idea.
Oh, no.
No, no,
I... I couldn't.
Wait.
I can't... I really...
Please, I really can't.
Let's see. This?
No.
Try this on.
See how it fits, huh?
(ZIPPER CLOSES)

Brava. Sei Bellissima.
Ah, Perfetto.

I have something to ask.
You may very likely refuse.
What is it?
I saw this afternoon
something I had previously
failed to notice,
certain resemblances
between you...
You and my wife.
I...
I... I think you know
what it is I ask.
If I have offended you,
I apologize
and ask that we forget
the matter entirely.
Your work here
will be unaffected.

I'm going to look after you.

You're hurting him now.
Let me care for him.
Let me care for them both.
Oh.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)
Is it her?
Or is it me?
(SOBBING)
You wanted to see me?
I think it's time for us
to review the progress
of your work,
to discuss any changes
in Jakob's behavior.
He needs me.
I can help him.
And yet he has still
said nothing.
It's for me to protect him,
and now I have made
things worse.
She wants me here
to take care of Jakob and...
And to take care of you.
The voice is real.
You're mad.
Yes.
You said it yourself.
"Serious condition."
I should have paid
closer attention. No!
Instead of helping Jakob, you've
made yourself unwell. No...
Now you hear whatever you wish!
(SHAKILY) No.
Yes.
Why would she speak to you
and not to her husband?
Please don't send me away.
Please.
I must do what is best,
above all, for Jakob.
But...
(WHIMPERS)

Jakob.
(SNIFFLING) He's going

This is how it must be.
We must help her.

Your mother

But she is suffering.
And she is tired.
And she is trapped.

we must help her.
We must help her.
You know what you must do.

It's time.

You have to let her go.
No. Jakob!
No, it has to be now.
Do you understand?
He will send me away

You have a fever.
That is all.
You don't have to leave.
I want you to stay.
Forgive me. We've been
under her spell too long,
not only Jakob, all of us.
I can't.
No, Jakob needs you.
For him.
I'm so afraid.
