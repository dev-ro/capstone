Adapted from the Movie "Black"
by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
My name is Ela.
I am the daughter of a wealthy family
from Buyukada.
This is the story
of me and my teacher.
It's about two people
who were left disabled by God.
We who fight fate and
made possible the impossible...
My story is
that of a different world.
Inside me, voices turn into silence,
light turns into darkness.
This world is neither seen
nor heard.
My world has only one name:
Black.
This is my world.
My World
How long can you live
in this darkness?
How many days? Hours? Minutes?
I lived in it for 40 years.
I've waited at the pier every day for
12 years for my teacher to arrive.
Each snowflake that falls
into my palm, reminds me of him.
All of my prayers consist of
him returning to me one day.
Stop, stop, wait right here.
Sister!
He's here. Mr. Mahir is here.
No, I'm not kidding. He is here.
Stop, slow down.
Teacher
Teacher
Teacher
Teacher! Teacher!
That day,
my teacher came back to me.
A full 12 years later.
But he had forgotten everything.
Even me.
I am writing this story for him.
For my teacher.
For my Mr. Mahir.
Are you sure
that he remembers nothing?
Is there nothing that we can do?
There is nothing, Mrs. Ayla.
Mr. Mahir is in the far stages
of Alzheimer's disease.
Doctor.
He must remember something, anything.
Or else, after all these years,
how did he find our house again?
He may have forgotten everything,
but not his memory of Ela.
Mrs. Handan, this disease
has erased everything in his memory.
Unfortunately,
there is no cure for Alzheimer's.
What is Ela doing?
She is reading him her life story,
written in Braille.
Perhaps this can remind him
of something.
My daughter believes in miracles.
She will not stop
until her teacher remembers.
This is impossible.
"Impossible". Ela's teacher
never taught her that word.
What you call "impossible" is
what my daughter will make possible.
My beautiful girl, my sweet girl.
I was two years old
when I met the darkness.
That was the night
that happiness left our house.
Ls my daughter better?
Ls my daughter all better now?
Is my daughter all better now?
Your father is here.
Let's see what the doctor has told
your father.
Handan...
The doctor says...
Ela is both deaf and blind.
What did you say?
Ela cannot see
and she cannot hear.
My gm.
He'?
Ela.
Ela.
My beautiful girl!
Your mommy...
Your mommy is here...
Ela!
My lady, my lady!
Hurry! The house is on fire!
Help!
- Ela!
- What's going on?
- Ela!
- Bring water, Huriye!
'Ela! 'Ela!
Look, Handan,
I've told you many times.
For eight years now...
there is a new accident
that happens every day in this house.
She stabbed someone with a fork...
and hit someone on the head
with a candlestick.
She almost burned the house down.
This girl is going to kill us all
one day.
As long as Ela is living
in this home...
we will never have peace of mind.
- What do you mean?
- We can't keep her anymore.
So, we send her
to a mental hospital?
How could you think of such a thing?
Handan, Ela is my daughter too.
I love her just as much as you do.
But it is impossible
to continue this way.
Before even larger disasters strike,
Ela needs to leave this house.
- She will not leave anywhere.
- I am growing impatient.
- Ayla
- Enough!
What have you done?
Let her go! Huriye, take the baby!
- Leave her alone, let go!
- She will leave this house!
My child will not go anywhere!
She's done nothing wrong!
Nothing!
My baby doesn't know anything!
She doesn't know!
She's drowning in the dark.
She doesn't know.
There is a special school
in Ankara...
providing education
for children like Ela.
Perhaps if you were to get involved,
they might send us a teacher.
To teach a deaf and blind child...
You need a wizard, not a teacher.
For God's sake Refik,
let's try one last time.
Maybe a teacher is Ela's last hope.
- Who is it?
- It's me, teacher, Sumbul.
Sumbul. The door is open.
Just push it and enter.
You come uninvited...
have a seat at least
and act like a real guest would.
Don't just pick things up here
and there and mix everything up.
Mr. Mahir...
No one outside these walls
would call...
rotting away with empty bottles
in a run-down house, a real life.
I'm in good company here.
Living with your sister's ghost
in here, aren't you?
Wounds of the past just don't heal,
my dear Sumbul.
But I'm happy here alone,
in my own mansion.
Someone is seeking a teacher.
A very prestigious family.
They applied to the school.
You are the only qualified one
in this entire country.
I just figured I'd stop by to see you
and inform you at the same time.
Maybe it will interest you,
so that...
you can salvage a life
is what I thought.
Salvage a life...
Salvage a life...
I created a new form of sign language
for the deaf and the blind...
to salvage their lives.
But I didn't do right by anyone.
With your efforts
and with your teaching...
you guided hundreds of people.
You wanted to create a miracle, but
were never presented the opportunity.
There is a girl here in waiting,
she can ease your pain.
Both deaf and blind.
They can't cope with her.
They can't cope with her?
If you don't go,
they will institutionalize her.
Just like my poor older sister.
So, they are going to take
this little girl to that hospital...
to basically bury her
in that stinking place, huh?
Yes, teacher.
If you don't lend a hand,
this little angel will disappear.
It was fate
that brought two like souls together.
God had left me incomplete.
You were a tired warrior.
I was waiting within my darkness.
You were on your way
to bringing me light.
Let's have a look at our girl,
shall we?
All we were missing was an alcoholic,
now that he's here, we are complete.
She wants to play. We will play.
Oh, you are such a pretty girl.
Come on, let me see you.
Come on.
Yes, a new person. A new hand.
A new face. A new figure.
Do you like my glasses perhaps?
Here you go. That's it.
Teacher. Teacher.
Teach...
- Does she understand you?
- No, she's just imitating me.
Way to go, girl. Well done.
What is she doing?
Sign for mommy.
Sorry about that.
Sorry about that. I'm so sorry.
It's nothing, madam.
These are bells.
What are these bells for?
That's how we find her
when she disappears, Mr. Mahir.
So, you are treated like an animal
in this home, huh, girl?
If you think of your daughter
as an animal...
what do you expect others
to think of her?
We are not the
trained professionals here.
It's your job to make her human,
Mr. Mahir.
But I wonder, how will you do it?
With fingers...
The eyes of the blind,
the voice of the mute...
and the poetry of the deaf.
Do you understand?
It is not as easy as
you make is seem, Mr. Mahir.
My daughter is stubborn,
just like me.
Arrogant!
Not you, I meant your daughter.
Dinner's almost ready.
If you want, let's head down.
My pleasure, madam.
Thank you, Ms. Huriye.
- Welcome, once more.
- Here you go, enjoy.
Enjoy your meal.
We went to dinner
at Madame Theodora's the other day.
The food was so delicious...
I've never been there.
- One day, we will take you.
- Of course we will. I'll invite you.
- Of course, I'd be pleased.
- Ms. Huriye.
Ela.
Ms. Huriye.
Please bring the cold dishes.
No! No.
- Mr. Mahir. Leave her alone.
- She has to learn how to behave.
Please let go of her hand.
This is why
she has not learned anything so far.
- That's it.
- Ela.
Mr. Mahir,
Ela always eats this way.
Ela may have always eaten this way
until now...
but that is going to change
from now on.
She will sit and eat from her own
plate, or she will be left hungry.
This is not education.
Is this how you treat
all of your disabled students?
Do you even feel sorry for them?
Do not call this child "disabled"
ever again.
Please note that
you are a worker in this house.
I'm not a worker, Mr. Refik.
I'm a teacher, a teacher!
- Leave now.
- Get out!
This is not the way to go,
Mr. Mahir, please.
You will help me, Mrs. Handan.
Get out! Get out!
All of you!
Let us leave him to his work.
Come on... Please.
Oh, that's good rice.
If Ela can be a good girl,
Ela will be able to eat some of it.
Spoon.
No eating with your hands, no.
Open your palm. Open!
Come here. Come here, my baby.
Come on.
Look... No!
This is a spoon.
What do we do with it?
We eat with it. Okay?
You are very strong.
Let's see...
Ela, sit down.
Spoon.
Mommy is not here.
Just you and me. Sit here.
Open your mouth.
That's it...
What sort of education is this,
my lady?
What we do, we eat like this,
isn't that right, sweetheart?
See.
Good for you.
Well done, good girl.
Think it over, for God's sake, Refik.
I beg of you. Look, please.
I know he has a strange form of
educating, but eventually...
He is a rude and arrogant man.
Moreover, an alcoholic.
He is not suitable for teaching.
But you don't know,
today, for the first time, Ela...
Look, my dear...
What is it that you want?
Do you enjoy seeing me
get insulted in our own home?
No.
He will leave this house immediately!
- Mr. Mahir?
- Yes?
Mr. Mahir, I need to talk to you.
I have prepared a report.
Concerning Ela.
Today was the first lesson.
Proper behavior and etiquette
training.
Unfortunately, both are qualities
which you do not possess, sir.
Anyway,
let's not let it go any further...
I want you to leave this house.
I'm going to leave but only
when it's time for me to go.
I still have time.
I do not like
your method of education.
As I do not like it
when you intervene in my work.
Your wage.
While I'm away on a business trip...
I do not want my wife and children
to be left alone with an alcoholic.
You will leave this island
tomorrow morning on the first ferry.
Will you then send Ela on the next
ferry to go to an asylum, is that it?
She's deaf and blind.
She will also be branded
mentally ill, is that it?
- That is none of your business.
- Yes, it is.
You will lock her up
in a loony bin and ruin her life.
Regardless,
you are finished in this house.
The first ferry is
at 7 in the morning.
Before I forget,
put this back on where it belongs.
Good day.
We will decide on what to do with Ela
when I return. Goodbye.
What's going on?
Where are you taking that?
Huriye, Huriye!
Who told you to take these?
Where are they moving things?
The teacher asked us to do it,
so we are doing it.
What? Ls the teacher here?
Mr. Mam.
Who gave you the right
to be an authority in my home?
- I am Ela's teacher.
- Not anymore.
Mr. Refik told you
to leave this house.
Why aren't you going?
If I leave this house, Mr. Refik
will lock Ela up in a madhouse.
Mr. Mam.
Look at me, Mr. Mahir!
I'm looking, Mrs. Handan.
As long as I'm alive,
no one can send my daughter anywhere.
Do you understand?
You reminded me
of my departed mother.
She would say the same thing.
"As long as I live, my daughter
will not be separated from me."
My sister
was just like your daughter.
She too was deaf and blind.
But one day, my mother
was forced to give her up.
The poor girl just rotted away
behind the iron gates of a madhouse.
Ela is deaf and blind, Mrs. Handan.
Not mentally retarded.
She needs to recognize the words.
Everything she touches, everything
she eats has a name and a meaning.
I'll teach them to her
through sign language.
It is not possible to begin with
the way the house is currently.
Firstly, we have to change
this part of the house.
Everything must be new to her.
No books, no pads, blank walls...
I even want to change
the smell of the room.
Secondly, only I'll have a say
in the education.
Thirdly, no one will enter this room,
and that includes you.
Don't shake your head, Mrs. Handan,
look at me.
Look at me, Mrs. Handan.
It will be difficult,
but we have to it for Ela.
Four
I don't want a single penny from you.
Five... No more alcohol for me.
And now...
When will I get my student?
Tonight.
Mrs. Handan, I just feel like
I want to sing out loud...
but my voice is really terrible.
That day, my mother
had a strange excitement in her.
She dressed me neatly
and combed my hair.
It's like we were getting ready
to go somewhere.
Apparently, that would be
the first day of school.
Your student is ready.
Alright.
Now that I am taking over,
let's get you out of here.
My student and I should be alone
for now. Come on Ela.
I've never left her alone before.
Please take care of her, be careful.
- Ela!
- No.
- She wants me.
- Please get out.
Please allow me through.
2O days, for just 2O days,
you will not touch her.
- Ela!
- I'm telling you to get out! Get out!
No mommy, no daddy.
Just me and you.
Your teacher, your friend.
Oh, dearest Ela,
your world will be very different.
Ela.
Come on, wake up, sleeping beauty.
Well...
The regular alphabet starts with
"A-B-C-D".
But your alphabet is "B-L-A-C-K".
Black.
Black.
Bird.
Ball.
Water.
Water.
Well done.
Water.
Ela, you are going to be end of me,
you know that?
Don't be afraid, touch it.
- Mr. Mahir?
- Yes, Mrs. Handan?
Ela is afraid of water,
just so you know.
I know, Mrs. Handan. I'm trying
to get her to get over this fear.
She will be swimming in five days.
Where are you going? Come here.
Stop, stop!
That's a thorn, just a thorn.
Come on, let's take a look.
This is an ointment.
This is an ointment, dear.
This will relieve your pain.
The pain will be gone.
- Your first handshake.
- Yeah, we're friends now.
This is the first butterfly kiss.
I will not hand Ela over to you now.
She has not learned anything yet.
She knows the word,
doesn't know the meaning of it.
She calls water, "spoon".
We still have a long way to go.
How long? It has been 19 days.
We agreed on 2O days, there are
still a few hours left to go.
What can possibly change
in just a few hours?
Many things can change.
When there is a power outage...
do we know when
the electricity will be back? No.
It leaves us in the dark for a while,
but we know the light will return.
That's why I'm here.
To bring some light inside of her.
Mr. Refik is coming
tomorrow morning.
I'm sorry, but
you need to leave before he arrives.
I have believed in you
from the start, Mr. Mahir.
Okay, tomorrow at dawn,
I will come to get Ela.
I will pray that
the dawn doesn't come so soon.
You've changed my daughter
into a proper lady.
You've changed her
into a proper lady.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
You have to know
the meaning of words, Ela.
If you don't know it,
you can't escape the dark.
You will not be able to reach
the light, my dear.
They will put these bells on you
again, like a donkey, like an animal.
Like an animal, just like an animal.
That is enough, Mr. Mahir. My dear.
They will put you in an asylum,
but I won't let them, not this time.
Ela, do you understand me?
You have to learn.
You are my last hope!
- Now, you need to leave.
- No, I'm not leaving.
Look, I kept my word,
now, it's your turn.
I have a little more time,
I'm waiting.
Mr. Refik will be here
at any time now.
I'm in a desperate position,
please understand.
She needs to know
that the hand she holds has a name.
She needs to know
that you are her mother.
Mommy.
Refik.
And this is daddy.
Mr. Mahir, you are still here?
Leave this house at once!
I just...
- Huriye, stop her.
- What can I do, sir?
Ela!
I've been trying to teach you
for 2O days now.
Every day...
You are going to use the napkin.
You will sit and eat with a spoon...
Sir, just let her eat.
You will eat with a spoon!
Now, I'll show you what it's like
to be thrown water at.
At me... You throw water at me.
I will teach you about water.
Now, you will learn about water.
Look, water...
Water.
Water, water...
Water.
Water.
Water.
Mrs. Handan, come at once!
Flower. A flower, dear. Flower.
Mr. Mahir, what happened?
Did something happen to Ela?
- She knows the meaning of the words.
- What?
She knows the meaning of the words.
Come on, Ela.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Mom-my.
Mom-my.
My baby! My baby!
Mommy.
Daddy.
Dad-ch; .
- Daddy.
- My baby.
My baby.
Teacher .
Teach...
You had won the first battle
against the darkness that day.
Yet today,
you remember nothing of it.
Now, it's my turn
to fight against your darkness.
I will teach you everything
that you once taught me.
Water.
Water.
Water.
Water.
The first word you taught me.
You wrote every little detail
on my arm.
Like the conductor of an orchestra.
- Mr. Refik.
- I'm coming.
Enjoy your meal.
Let me introduce you...
to the dean of the faculty of
science and literature, Mr. Bedri.
Nice to meet you.
Hopefully, our girl Ela,
will study at his university.
Is that so?
How quickly time passes,
doesn't it?
It does, it sure does...
Come on.
Do you recognize her?
That can't be Ayla.
- Do you remember your aunt Sevinc?
- Welcome, aunt Sevinc.
Where is Ela? I want to see her.
Have you seen your sister, dear?
I don't know, mom.
You guys have fun.
Look over there.
Bravo.
Bravo.
She can't see, can't hear,
but how beautifully she dances...
Ela is my student, Mr. Bedri,
I had told you about her.
I want her to go to your university.
Is this a joke?
That's impossible.
"Impossible". That's a word
I never taught her the meaning of.
Mr. Mahir, you know, there are
special schools for such students.
Yes... For weaving baskets, sewing,
hand weaving carpets, is that so?
Mr. Mahir, for the love of God, have
you ever seen a student like Ela...
gain acceptance
into a normal college?
I have not.
But I'd like to see it.
- How can she understand the lessons?
- As she always does.
I also attend the classes,
and sit next to her.
I explain every lesson
in sign language...
word for word, letter by letter.
Bravo! Bravo!
Meet the administrator
of the university.
I told him. I said that you wanted to
take courses in literature.
Sir, I need to consult
with the board on this topic.
In this life, we truly get too few
chances and opportunities...
to do something truly good
for other people.
Mr. Mahir,
you know that this university...
is meant for normal students.
But, because of the faith
that you have in Ela...
and because we believe
that you are a good teacher...
we have scheduled
an interview for Ela.
Thank you.
We have here today, a teacher that
neither of you are acquainted with.
She will perform
the interpretations.
Ms. Sumbul, please.
Ms. Sumbul.
Are you ready for the interview?
We are ready, sir.
Why does she want to study?
Why do you want to study?
"To live with dignity and
independence, in order to thrive...
I want to study and learn."
How many oceans are there
in the world?
How many oceans are there
in the world?
"For me,
every drop of water is an ocean."
You need to provide
a clear answer.
You need to give clear answers
to the questions.
As we are in Turkey,
where is America located?
As we are in Turkey,
where is America located?
"The earth is round.
That's why, America can be found
in both the east and the west."
What does knowledge mean for her?
What does knowledge mean for you?
"Knowledge is everything."
Knowledge is
spirit, courage, light, and sound.
"Knowledge is my teacher."
Bravo.
Bravo.
Ela is a university student now.
Congratulations, Mr. Mahir.
So, you answered all the questions
right. Well done, my beautiful girl.
Ela has been smiling all day today,
Mr. Refik.
You should always smile like this,
my dear.
Our daughter is
a college student as of today...
of course she deserves
to be smiling.
Can you imagine Ela
graduating from college?
My daughter will receive a diploma
and throw her cap.
Isn't that right, Ayla? This is
so special and nice for your sister.
Sure, mom, everything my sister does
is very special, isn't it?
Anyways,
I have to finish my homework.
Good day to you.
- Welcome, Mr. Mahir.
- Welcome, Mr. Mahir.
- Good afternoon, Ayla.
- Good afternoon.
Mr. Mahir,
you have performed a miracle.
We still have a long way to go,
Mr. Refik.
She has been eagerly waiting
for your gift all morning.
What is my gift?
I don't want to be dependent on it.
This will make you independent,
not dependent, trust me.
It was the beginning of a new life.
New excitements, new horizons...
You had faith in me,
I had faith in my wings.
Do you remember
how happy I was that day?
What did I tell you?
I don't feel right at heart about
Ela staying in this house all alone.
There is nothing to worry about,
Mr. Refik.
Ms. Huriye is here, I'm here.
It's very close to the university.
She will meet new people.
Besides,
we can't protect her forever.
Everything is going to be very good,
don't worry.
- I'm so sick of it, mom.
- Ayla.
Anything I put
anywhere, she either
throws it out or
places it elsewhere.
What has gotten into you,
what is this?
We were all just having
a good laugh inside...
where is all of this coming from?
Enough is enough, mom,
I also have a limit.
She's just so excited,
can't you see that?
I understand everything, mom.
Don't worry.
It's always about her, isn't it?
Her happiness, her enthusiasm...
And me? What about me?
Do we need to speak
in sign language in this house...
in order to be understood'?
God, grant me patience.
Do you hear what she's saying to me?
Ela!
No, leave her.
She will stand every time she falls,
leave her alone.
Let it go.
Well done, Ela.
She can get up on her own.
Now, I want for you
to walk by yourself.
5O steps straight ahead,
then you take a right. Alright.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
To class. We are going this way.
No, this way. We are late already.
Let's run, come on, run.
Come on, run!
- Deniz Bagci?
- Here.
- Ayse Kurtulus?
- Here.
- Mehmet Tolunoglu?
- Present.
Ela Bayindir?
As life begins in the womb,
or from the soil.
This journey
both begins and ends in the darkness.
You would speak through your hands
to me tirelessly, 24 hours straight.
One day we are all going to have to
go through the darkness.
New doors had opened for me.
- Can't you see where you are going?
- I'm sorry.
New friends, new thoughts,
a new kind of poetry...
"You see what you envision."
She's objecting to the poet.
"It is not the eyes that dream,
but the mind."
My eyes don't see,
but I still have dreams.
"Our dream is to graduate one day."
We are ready.
Tree.
Butterfly.
Bird.
Fish.
Bee.
The most beautiful years
of my life.
Memories
that bring me joy till this day.
No problem, let's continue.
"The changing seasons,
coming and going.
Autumn has come..."
Did that tickle?
It's not going to snow.
Concentrate on the lecture.
We don't need an umbrella.
Give me the umbrella.
Give it here.
Give it to me, I said.
You write too slowly,
how will you pass the exams?
You are going to try, you say.
1O words per minute is not enough.
You are going to work
toward 3O words per minute, you say.
Come on now!
Pass?
No, you've failed.
Not just two courses,
you have failed all of them.
Congratulations.
People generally celebrate success,
but we celebrated failure.
Hello?
Hello.
Mr. Mahir, how are you, how is Ela?
We are fine, Mrs. Handan, just fine.
They announced
the results of the exams today...
I hope you have good news.
Not so good, we failed again.
She had told us
that her exams went well.
So, she probably lied
in order to enjoy her holiday break.
Mr. Mahir, isn't it you
who always says...
"by falling over and over again,
she'll learn to get up"?
But I have to teach her how to fly,
before I crash myself.
Mrs. Handan,
you do realize I'm getting older now.
Stop it, Mr. Mahir...
Hello?
Hello!
She failed again?
What can we do? It happens.
Hello?
Mommy...
My beautiful girl.
Teacher...
Mommy...
Home...
You want to come home?
I love you so much.
I love you so much, baby.
I love you...
so much.
Come in.
Mr. Mam.
- Mr. Bedri, you've summoned me?
- Mr. Mahir. Have a seat.
Mr. Mahir...
Ela has been taking in the same
classes for two years now.
I have decided to do something
in order to help her.
All of the study and
all of the lecture notes...
for the first two years,
written in Braille.
You once said:
"We get too few chances
and opportunities in life...
to truly help people."
Mr. Bedri,
thank you very much...
for not missing out
on this opportunity to help.
From now on, there will be nothing
that can stop Ela from progress.
Thank you so much.
My pleasure, sir.
It is my duty, my happiness,
my pride...
How's that, I have gotten
sign language down good, haven't I?
Mr. Mahir...
Are you okay?
You should take these notes to Ela.
How do I get outside from here?
Excuse me?
How do I get outside?
The same way you came in.
From the door behind you.
Teacher .
Are you okay?
Teacher .
I've developed new feelings
as I've grown.
Some things I don't understand.
I never really knew anyone
besides you.
That's why, I've thought of a
different relationship with you.
Was it wrong to think like this?
So many things were changing.
But my failure stayed constant.
Ela, time's up.
I already gave you some extra time.
It's not enough for you
to know the answers.
You need to write them faster.
You disappoint me, I'm very upset.
Why are you just standing there?
Come on, let's go.
Don't worry, Mr. Mahir.
She's not the only one to blame,
Mrs. Handan, it's my fault too.
We have been taking the same courses
for three years.
We have been failing the same courses
for three years.
- It's nothing.
- Her writing is very slow.
Two minutes for ten words...
Where are you going, huh?
Put that luggage down.
Ela.
That's it, I want to go home.
No, you are not going anywhere.
I don't want to stay,
I don't want to study.
You are going to stay,
you are going to study.
Get that through your head!
Calm down, please.
I wasted 18 years of my life,
Mrs. Handan.
I cannot stand failure.
Come back here!
Where are you going? Come here.
Come back here!
Come back here!
Don't run away from failure!
What's this?
You have no respect for the books?
Pick up those books, right now!
You will study
as long as I am alive.
I don't want to study.
You will study.
You will graduate.
What about our dream?
Wearing a black graduation gown.
I don't want the gown.
My world is black.
Your world is not black.
It's full of light.
My world is black.
Black... Black... Black...
Black... Black... Black...
Black... Black... Black...
Black... Black... Black...
6O words
in less than two minutes.
We are no longer slow, Mrs. Handan.
Now, we have earned some ice cream,
sweetheart.
Now, it's time to celebrate.
Ice cream?
Yes, Mrs. Handan.
Life is like ice cream, we need to
enjoy it before it melts away.
Two, please.
Yes sir, right away.
Here you go, sir.
Your ice cream.
You forgot your change, sir!
Sir, your change!
Are you alright, dear?
She jumped in front of the car.
Are you okay? What are you doing?
Are you hurt anywhere?
- Mr. Mahir?
- Yes.
Sir, do you not recognize me?
Bedri... From the university...
Mr. Bedri.
Sir, I will call Ela down right now.
Ela, where are you?
Sir, Ela can't hear you.
Ms. Huriye,
can you please bring Ela here?
Sir, Ela is not at home.
She is right here.
Mr. Mahir, you forgot the way
outside, you forgot my name...
These are not important,
but you also forgot Ela.
You have a serious problem.
You should see a doctor.
Good night.
I'm sorry.
"It doesn't matter."
"Don't forget me again."
I promise.
I will never forget you again.
You are scared for me.
Don't be scared for me.
I'm just getting a little old.
Come on now, go to sleep.
"Can you sing me a lullaby?"
I can't sing.
Please.
Again, her violet eyes are
Shutting now.
She has rows of tears
On her eyelashes and brow.
Go to sleep, my dear,
Go to sleep now.
Go to sleep, my dear...
go to sleep now.
A storm destroyed
my most beautiful dreams.
I felt fear
for the first time that day.
If you forget me, how can I live?
- What is my sister saying?
- She doesn't want to go downstairs.
Why?
She thinks
that she would ruin the night.
What's this about? Did she really
come all his way for this?
Okay, stop being ridiculous.
Today, I don't want to see you fight,
please don't upset me.
Come on, help your sister prepare.
Dress her up.
There's a lot of work for me to do
downstairs, come on.
Sister, I have a favor to ask.
So far, everything you have done
was very special.
But tonight is my special night.
I fell in love.
Semih and I are getting engaged
before you do...
and we do love each other
very much.
I know this may upset you.
Maybe you will never have
a night like this in your life.
Maybe you will never fall in love.
But one day, if you do fall in love,
then, you will know what I mean.
Please don't ruin my night.
I'm very happy today.
I want to say a few things, now that
all of my loved ones are here.
I'm very lucky
to have parents like you.
And to have a sister like Ela.
Perhaps, I have not been
a very good daughter...
or a very good sister.
But I would like to say,
I love you all.
I love this house.
We have memories
all over the house.
I remember playing outside
with my sister one day.
We were running hand in hand
in the garden.
We both fell and began to cry.
My mom and dad came running and...
lifted Ela from the ground.
But they left me on the floor.
Arms stretched out, waiting...
And I'm still waiting.
As a child, I'd get mad at Ela.
Although I loved her,
I was very jealous.
I would feed Ela
all of the food I disliked.
At nights,
I would ask if she was thirsty...
and even though she would reply
"I'm thirsty"...
I would turn my back
and go to sleep.
She waited for water
from me all night.
I can't believe I did this.
I want to go.
For all of the bad and unjust things
I've done, I apologize to all of you.
Did I say something wrong?
Let me finish.
I don't want to hear it.
Sister!
Sit down. Sit down.
For this happy evening,
Ela had prepared a speech for Ayla.
She would have told in sign language,
and I would read it, but...
Ela doesn't feel like it now.
I want to read it to you anyways
because I want you all to hear it.
She wrote...
"I was eight years old.
Wild, fierce, and furious with life."
Then, my mother put Ayla on my lap.
I recognized her beauty.
I touched her little eyes.
I realized that I would get to
see the world through Ayla's eyes.
My mother would say that I couldn't
help it but smile all day.
Ayla would share
all of her happiness with me.
She would take my by the hand
and take me everywhere.
When our mother was not around,
she would feed me.
She would wake me up at night
and ask me if I wanted water.
You have been
the voice of my fingers.
I look forward to your wedding.
I will be dressed beautifully
that day.
I may never become a bride but I'll
be beside you there, at your wedding.
Teach Semih the sign language.
I have many complaints about you.
As you walk towards a new life
with Semih...
"...I promise, I won't cry."
A toast for Ayla and Semih.
Ayla Bayindir,
without being under any influence...
do you knowingly take
Semih Sener to be your husband?
Yes.
You, Semih Sener,
without being under any influence...
do you knowingly take
Ayla Bayindir to be your wife?
Yes.
Signatures, please.
Both said "yes".
With the authority given to me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Congratulations.
He gave the book.
He opened her veil.
Kissed her.
On the lips...
Teacher .
What are you doing in my room?
You want to talk.
You love me?
You are in pain.
I understand your pain.
You'll never know
how it is to love a man.
"Will you kiss me?
Once..."
With him recognizing me as a woman,
he could no longer be my teacher.
I knew I wanted a lot.
I made a big mistake.
You didn't even give me the
opportunity to ask for forgiveness.
"Just as you never forget your cane,
don't forget one more thing:"
The darkness
wants to swallow you up.
Always walk towards the light.
Your every step
will fill me with life.
"Mahir."
Once again, the light turned
into darkness, sound into silence...
I walked the path you showed me
for 12 years, without you.
It was dark and lonely.
This is your bed,
lay down, please.
Mr. Mam.
Mr. Mam.
Mr. Mam.
Mr. Mam.
Teacher?
Teacher .

Dear youth,
today, we see someone...
showing an example of
fortitude and strength...
proving that
nothing is impossible in life.
We are very proud of her
as a university.
Now, I would like to invite her here.
Ela Bayindir!
That's my girl.
"After trying many times, the little
black fish has reached her home."
The ant climbed the mountain,
the tortoise crossed the desert...
and Ela graduates today.
But between you and me,
there is a difference.
What you can do in two decades,
I did in forty years.
But in the end, I succeeded.
When I was little, I would always
stay behind the other children.
My parents would be ashamed of me.
Each year, I'd call home and say
'mom, I failed'.
But today, I say
'mom, I passed'.
I know that they are proud of me.
Proudly, they say,
'this is our daughter'.
I would like to thank them.
As a child, I was always in pursuit.
But in the end,
I found only darkness.
One day, my mother put me
in unfamiliar arms.
He was different than everyone,
he was a magician.
He dragged me from the dark
into the light.
He was my teacher.
For me, everything was black.
But he taught me
the other meaning of black.
Black, is not just drowning
in the dark...
it's also the color of knowledge,
of success and of graduation robes.
Today, our common color.
All of you are in gowns
to celebrate graduation...
but I'm not wearing my gown.
I want my teacher to be the first
person to see me in my gown.
He would bring me here
every year.
Each year, standing in front of
the door, writing on my arm...
'l want to see you
on that stage one day'.
It took me 4O years to realize
my teachers dream.
But today,
for the first time in my life...
I feel the lack of my sight.
"Because I would love for
my teacher to see me in my gown."
My teacher.
Our dream.
Water.
Water. Water.
Today, my teacher remembered
our first word: Water.
He is the world's greatest teacher.
Once again, he proved that nothing is
impossible in the world...
and he taught me how great it is
to live for someone else.
But his alphabet is just like mine.
It doesn't start with "A-B-C-D".
It's "B-L-A-C-K". Black.
