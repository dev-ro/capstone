[ Sharon Narrating ]
As Sharon Gill stared at the woman and her pet-
[ Purring ]
she was consumed with grief
over her own cat, Harold.
Three days ago,
Harold had jumped out the window.
[ Meowing ]
Afterward, she learned that
this was not uncommon with cats.
The fact that Harold landed on his feet
1 0 floors below was of little consolation.
- [ Thud ]
- Oh!
[ Hissing ]
[ Sharon Narrating ]
Sharon understood that Harold was a trigger.
That she was emotionally exhausted.
[ Chattering ]
Ohh.
[ Sharon Narrating ]
Still, caring more for a dead cat than her sick patients...
was clearly a case
of clinical depersonalization.
Open.
Wider.
Excuse me.
[ Sharon Narrating ]
No one had ever mentioned this reality...
when she was a bright, shiny medical student.
[ Nurse ]
Uh, Doctor?
When she believed she was going
to save the world one patient at a time.
Doctor.
No one told her
that care does not equal need.
Care being finite, need being endless.
Doctor! Move, man. Move.
What care equals...
is 1 5 minutes per patient.
- Doctor, Mrs. Fine is in 4.

Mrs. Fine! She's one of
Dr. Fielding's patients...

And we got Wong in 3

- Who are you?
- [ Sighs ] l'm Dr. Gill.
l want Dr. Fielding.
l understand,
but he was sent away on an emergency.
Emergency. Bullshit!
He just wanted to get a jump on the weekend.
Sir, l was able to look over your scan—
Are you even old enough
to practice medicine?
Has Dr. Fielding gone over
the results with you?
No.
No, as in he hasn't called?
He thinks it's migraines.
l have headaches, bad ones.
- When did he say that?
- When l was here last.
That was before the scan?
Yeah.
What?
- Can you please sit down?
- Why?
- Because l would like for you to sit.
- Why does it matter?
- Because l need you to sit down.
- l need to stand.
Fine, stand.
The results showed a brain aneurysm.
Wow.
[ Exhales ]
Mr. Altmann...
do you know what a brain aneurysm is?
My uncle died of one.
One minute he was brushing his teeth,
the next, he was dead.
Didn't even have time to rinse.
lt's a ballooning-out
of an artery wall in the brain.
- And when it pops?
- That would be a hemorrhagic stroke.
And l'm dead.
The seriousness depends on the size
and location of the aneurysm.
How big is it?
l'm an internist.
lt's best if you speak to a specialist.
- You have the scan right there! How big?
- l understand.
- But there's a specialist, a neurologist at Brooklyn—
- You know, right?
Dr. Bernstein. l already called.
l made arrangements—
What are you scared of?
lt's not your brain!
Just look at the scan and tell me!
lt's big.
And the location?
Please, sir, l think it's best
that we talk to a neurologist.
The location?
By the brain stem.
Untreatable?
lt's not for me to say.
You already have.
How long has it been there?
A long time, l'm betting.
Why didn't they find it till now?
Are you incompetent
or you just don't care?
- That's it, you don't care, do you?
- No. No, no, no.
- No what?
- No, l do care!
Bullshit! You're thinking,
how inconvenient, how annoying...
how difficult, how disagreeable.
Poor little princess. Poor, poor you.
Well, excuse me for dying!

lt's bad for your blood pressure.
- Please sit back down.
- How long do l have?

- No, l don't.

Cerebral aneurysm.
And you let him walk out of here?
- That wasn't the plan!
- Christ!

Seriously, Christ, Sharon.
l know, l know.
l'm horrible. l'm a horrible person.

l have kids. l have a life."

- No, you didn't.

- He said that he loved me. He—
- [ Groans ]

Let's focus on the logic.
Like the patient. What's the guy's name?
Altmann. Henry Altmann.
Okay, Henry Altmann.
That's a great name.
That sounds like a very wholesome,
nice family man's name.
l'm sure this is not the type of guy
who's gonna freak out...
file complaints, just go totally nuts on you,
trying to ruin your career.
Ohh.
Okay, l'm getting the impression
maybe he is that type of guy.
This is bad.
This is miscommunication, is what this is.
l need to get him admitted
to a hospital today, for his own good...
and then he's somebody else's problem.
Then he's Bernstein's problem. Right?
Can't hurt.
l have to find Henry Altmann.
A Dr. Gill has been calling for you.
- Where's Aaron?
- She said it was extremely important.
Where's Aaron?
ln the meeting.
[ Aaron ]
148 and 65 Charles Street.
There is a six-month advance on the one
and a six-month delinquency on the other.
My long-lost brother.
What if you pick up
the pending violations on 148?
- Garbage.
- And boiler.
- l have a question.
- About the boiler?
No, l need some advice.
A client, he just found out
he has 90 minutes to live.
- What should l tell him to do?
- Henry, we really need to get back to this now.
- [ Man ] l know what l would do.
- What?
Cry.
For the first 20 minutes.
Then l'd go to that Thai massage place
on York and get a blowjob.
l'd go to Temple lsrael, pray a little,
make a nice big donation.
Can we get back to this now?
- Me, l think l'd kill someone.
- Why?
For the social good.
Some deeply evil schmuck.
- Like who?
- We live in Brooklyn. How hard could it be?
l got a joke. Hang on a second.
Man goes to see a doctor,
and he's told that he only has 1 0 hours to live.
lt's a terrible shock.
What's he gonna do?
So he picks up the phone
and he calls his wife, and he says...
"Honey, l'm gonna take you to the Four Seasons,
the best restaurant in town...
and we're gonna eat everything
on the menu.
And then, we're gonna go
to the Rainbow Room...
where we're gonna dance all hours,
like we were young again.
And then, finally, home,
where we will make mad, passionate love...
till all hours of the night,
until, at last, at dawn...
l will die in your loving arms.
What do you think of that?"
And the wife says, "Easy for you.
You don't have to get up in the morning."
[ Chuckles ]
- Henry.
- What?
Tell your client to go home,
make love to his wife one last time and be happy.
ln the end...
all we have is family.
Family?
You're right.
Family. Thanks.
You're not gonna be billing us
for this crap, are you?
Hey, hey, Henry, wait up!
- Where you going?
- Home.
You know, if you want out
of the meeting just say so...
or don't show up like you always do...
but this bullshit is really annoying.
ls this gonna take a long time?
You know, you're getting worse.
You know that, right,
that you're getting worse?
- l got a lot to do.
- ln 90 minutes?
Less.
Family?
Yeah, family.
So, what, brothers don't count?
Because we got a lot of work to do.
l'm thinking, you know, immediate family.

What?
Well, uh, come on, Henry.

but fight for two years. And Tommy?

[ Henry Narrating ]
Henry was fully committed...
to make tender love
to his wife one last time.
But there were concerns.
For one, he couldn't remember
the last time they'd done it.
A year ago? Maybe more.
Henry also wondered what was
the appropriate position for a last shtup?
He assumed spooning must be involved.
Then again, he had read
that condemned prisoners...
often asked for peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches as their last meal.
Certainly, the missionary position
was the PB&J of sex.
And, of course, there
was Henry's biggest concern.
Would he be able to raise the flag at all?
As Henry ran, he prayed,
not for a medical miracle...
but for the simple ability to get it up.
l know l shouldn't be telling you this...
and it's going against every protocol...
but, um...
your brother was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm
and is refusing treatment.
Oh, God.
Well, uh...
- are you his doctor?
- Yes.
Well, no. l mean, l'm filling in
for his doctor, Dr. Fielding.
And this diagnosis is definite?
l'm afraid so.
He— He was just here...
and l was awful.
You didn't know.
l knew something was strange.
But with Henry,
there's always something sort of strange.
He had a son, Peter. Great kid.
Died two years ago
in a hunting accident, of all things.
Henry's never been the same since.
We used to have lunch together every day.
He would bring
a brown paper bag in and we—
Two sandwiches.
One for him, one for me.
We talked about everything.
And now we don't talk
about anything anymore.
Wait. Ninety minutes.
How can you be sure it's only 90 minutes?
That's a misunderstanding.
How do you misunderstand that?
The important thing is we find your brother...
and get him admitted
to a hospital immediately.
- He went home.
- [ Beeps ]
Bette, it's Aaron.
l'm on my way to your apartment.
Call me back on my cell.
lt's an emergency. Any instructions?
Oh, um. Make sure that he remains calm.
Nothing that raises his blood pressure.
- Like?
- Anger.
And you've met my brother?
Henry, l thought you were working late.
Frank, hi. Get out.
- What's going on?
- He needs to leave!
[ Bette ]
He's our neighbor!
No, no. l need you alone.
Why?
Because we have to have sex immediately
and then cuddle.
What, are you nuts?
No, no. l just wanna have a moment,
a husband and wife moment.
lt'll be a good thing, a family thing.
l don't have a lot of time.
- l really think l should go.
- You stay.
- Go!
- You're staying!
Stop that! l don't care how crazy you are,
we are not having sex.
Oh, but, Bette, listen...
l know the last two years
have been tough...
and l didn't deal well with, you know...
and l've been erratic
and often pissed off at things.
- You think?
- But it doesn't mean l've stopped
loving you in my own way.
And in the end, what is there?
Family. Our family.
And this is our default position,
me and you.
And making love to you is my way
of telling you l know what's important.
We can do it in the kitchen, if you like.
What the hell is the matter with you?
- Can't l make love to my wife?
- No.
- Why the hell not?
- Because sex isn't some magic switch you pull...
just because you're feeling
a momentary twinge of guilt.
- Guilt? What guilt?
- About being horrible?
- Who said l was horrible?
- Oh, l thought that part was obvious.
- What's he still doing here?
- l-l really-
You know what? Stay!
You always were a little bit of a jerk...
but you were an amusing jerk.
But since Peter, you're just a jerk!
l lost a son, for Christ's sake!
And l didn't?
You just can't honor the son we lost...
and you drove away the one
we do still have!
Tommy doesn't deserve that!
This has nothing to do with Tommy!
You never accepted his life choices!
Ballroom dancing is not a life choice...
it's a Tuesday night on a Fiesta cruise!
- Fuck you!
- Yeah.
- Oh. You still want that husband and wife moment?
- Maybe.
Do you even remember
the last time we had sex?
- Yeah! Um—
- Well, l don't!
Because l have sex all the time,
just not with you!
Frank?
- [ Laughs ] No way!
- Why not Frank?
Duh. Standards.
What standards?
He's not in your league!
He's not even playing the same sport!
We love each other!
Oh! Puke! Ohh!

He's got issues. Yeah.

[ Sharon ]
Shit!
Okay. Thank you. Oh.
Are you always this passionate
about your work?
[ Doorbell Rings ]
- Hi, Bette.
- Oh, Aaron, thank God you're here.
This is Dr. Gill. Dr. Gill, Bette.
- Your fucking brother-
- Sharon.
She's a pretty one. Come in.
l've gotta talk to you.
Come in! Come in!
Henry, call me back as soon as you possibly can.
l've just heard the news.
Why didn't you tell me?
You just went on and on about sex,
for God's sake.
You know Frank
doesn't mean anything to me.
l love you!
[ Sharon Narrating ]
Sharon took in the habitat of her difficult patient.
The photographs of Henry's family,
in particular...
made her want to vomit.
"Look," they said, "l am a family man.
l am a man that is capable of love."
She reminded herself
that Hitler was also capable of love.
At least for his dog.
Which reminded her of
her love for her cat, Harold.
All in all, the family photos
had the decided effect...
of making her hate Henry even more.
Do you have family, Dr. Gill?
No. Not really.
Well, Mom and Dad in Wisconsin.
But, you know, divorced, married.
Thrice!
Thanksgivings are a mess.
Guess, uh—
Guess l don't know "normal."
The only normal people there are
are the ones you don't know very well.

Oh, well, hey, l'm here.

- Forty-three.
No! What prompted it?
Not that you need a reason
to call an old buddy.
Not that we do, you know, call.
- l'm dying.
- Right. Long as you don't need any money.
Because l am broke-o.
No, no, just dying.
Right. Who isn't?
Soon.
Oh.
For real?
For real.
'Cause l thought you were talking
metaphorically, you know?
'Cause l feel like
l've been dying for years now.
Brain aneurysm.
l have a brain aneurysm and—
Oh, Henry.
Oh, Henry, l'm sorry.
Oh, buddy, that sucks.
Yeah.
- How much time they give you?
- Hour and a half.
That's it?
Apparently.
And you wanted to spend it with me?
l'm touched. No, l'm touched.
Because old bonds are the strongest, right?
- Yeah.
- And l know what you're going through...
because last year l had kidney stones...
and before l passed them,
l felt like l was gonna die.
You know,
they say it's worse than childbirth.
- You got two kids, right?
- Had.

Oh, you looked so happy.
Me? l never had kids.
But l think it was for the best

- No. Dagon, no.
- Yeah, that's what they call me.
You remember that girlfriend
that you stole from me in high school?
What?

Remember you stole Gloria from me?
Who?
Gloria Cameron.
Remember? Redhead.
- Beautiful skin like milk.
- No.
Oh, come on!
You really don't remember her?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Love.
Love! How you squashed it!
l tell you l'm dying
and all you can talk about is you?
You and some high school crush
from 40 years ago?
- l wanted to get it off my chest!
- And you had to wait till now?
Not my fault it's now or never!
You really don't remember her?
This is insane! l'm sorry you turned
into some lonely, pathetic fuck, Dagon!
But l have to go. Fuck you!

- No, fuck you.
- Go fuck yourself!

this cab hit my car.
Then l went to the hospital
and Dr. Gill told me that l had a brain aneurysm...
- and l had 90 minutes to live.
- From the car accident.
No. Then l went to my office
and this guy was telling a joke...
about a man having sex with his wife
one last time, and l thought...
"Hey, that sounds like a good idea.
l'll go home and try it with mine."
l get there and there's my wife
sitting with my neighbor.
Turns out they've been shtupping
the whole time and l had no idea.
So l get out of there and l go to Juniors...
and l invited all these people to say good-bye
to them and only one guy shows up...
and he's pissed off at me
for stealing his high school sweetheart...
- who l don't even remember!
- Calm. Calm.
So l go across the street
to buy a video camera from this nice guy.
A little bit- D-D-D-D- But still a good guy.
Not the fastest salesman.
And l give the video camera to a homeless guy
to videotape me talking to my son.
And l get a little upset
because after law school...
he decides to be a dance instructor
rather than a lawyer.
- The homeless guy?
- No, my son.
l had all these business cards printed up.
But what can you do?
l got upset and then l passed out.
And when l came to,
l jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge.
That's when she shows up.
She jumps in the East River.
She fishes me out.
That's why we're wet.
Then we got picked up
by the same cabbie who hit me earlier.
She maces him
and that's how we got this cab.
- Weird, huh?
- Yeah.
You weren't kidding
about him needing brain surgery.
No, no, no, not at all!
- Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

if you knew how long you had?
l would try and figure out
how to be happy.
Then why don't you?
Maybe l will.
lf it's all right with you,
l'm gonna close my eyes now.
[ Sharon Narrating ]
No one expected Henry to survive one day.
lnstead, he lived for eight days.
lt was sort of like the Hanukkah miracle.
ln that eight days,
he had long talks with his wife...
shared one last brown bag lunch
with his brother...
and cheated his son at gin rummy.
My tombstone will say,
"Henry Altmann, 1 951 dash 2014."
l never knew till now,
it's not the dates that matter...
- it's the dash.
- The dash?
You little shtarker.
You already knew that, didn't you?
Kind of.
You picked your own path.
You lived your life,
even though it pissed me off.
l'm proud of you, kid. Gin.
- That card was up your sleeve.
- No, worse.
[ Laughs ]
[ Sharon Narrating ] For eight days,
Henry Altmann never got angry even once.
Except at the very end,
when he told death to go fuck himself.
[ Mouthing Words ]
And then he turned his thoughts
to things that pleased him...
and sailed away.
[ Henry Narrating ]
No one expected Sharon Gill to go back to her old life.
And, indeed, she did not.
On the same day, she quit her job...
her pills and Dr. Fielding.
And then signed up to work
at a free clinic on Bergen Street...
where she could spend
more than 1 5 minutes per patient...
and be the doctor
she always wanted to be.
By summer, she felt she kept
her promise to Henry to be happy.
Enough to adopt a new cat...
and to begin to date again.
What about you guys?
Any plans for this winter?
We might go on a bike tour in Hawaii.
No, l don't bicycle well.
Dad didn't teach us.
Henry hated bicycles.
What? Why?
He considered them predatory.
All right, speaking of, huh,
who's got Henry?
Yeah, let's do this.
l do. l do.
- Mom, will you?
- Brown paper bag.
- He's a simple man.
- [ Chuckles ] l love it.
[ Henry Narrating ] As Henry Altmann prepared
to go into the East River for the second time...
he added "Being in the East River"...
to the list of things he hated.
But he also felt at peace...
secure in the knowledge that somehow...
he would live on in the hearts
of those who loved him.
Hey! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?
What the hell?
l ask you, what the hell?
What do you think we're doing, littering?
What are you,
the River Beautification Patrol?
l ask you, do you think
we're sprinkling fairy dust all over Brooklyn?
Are you the Fairy Dust Police?
Are you one of those guys
that hates anything that tinkles?
Have you no humility?
No fucking manners?
lt's ashes, you moron!
A ground-up friend,
husband and father, you asshole!
lf you can't understand that,
why don't you come over here?
- Leave it alone!
- Come here and talk to us!
What, you don't have a father?
- [ All Shouting ]
- [ Tommy ] You don't have a father?
Yeah, you better run! You better run!
[ All Laughing ]
[ Frank ]
Fuck you!
