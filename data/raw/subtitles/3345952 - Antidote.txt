Tiger! Tiger! Burning bright,
In the forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
William Blake
Monsters never forget.
The evil they have done.
The blood they have spilled.
The promises they haven't kept.
No matter the passage of time,
they never forget.
And monsters know how to hide.
In the depths of the city,
among millions of innocent people...
...they hunt with impunity.
No one can stop them.
We call these monsters "hitmen".
Sometimes, hell is on earth.
It is near
to those you love the most.
The ones you sweat and bled for.
Sometimes, it takes you 40 years
to realize this.
So, you want to quit the game?
Both of these are crucial, Kadir.
Both of them are fruits of a tree
watered with blood for 20 years.
You should know,
you drew that blood.
Talk straight to me,
because I know you well.
Will you do if, or will you not?
I won't.
When I was one,
back in the village, I got ill.
Nobody could cure me.
They said I rolled in agony.
No sleep, crying all the time...
My mother took me, far away,
to an old villager.
A "surgeon", so they said.
He wasn't.
For everyone to see...
...the old man took out a razor
and began to cut open my back.
With every cut,
yellow bile gushing and gushing...
Then, my crying stopped.
Everyone wondered if I was dead.
The old man took a cloth,
dipped it in vinegar...
...wrapped it on my back
and put me to bed.
I slept comfortably.
Even at this age,
I still cam! Those scars on my back.
How many men have you killed for me?
66.
You cut open the infected back
of this world 66 times for me.
I'm not so young as to be disloyal.
So be if, tell me "no".
Now, you can quit the game.
What's the girl's name?
They fear you more than me.
They whisper "Demon"
behind your back.
Neither money nor fame could
take you away from us. Only love could.
- What's her name?
- Elsa.
Come to the restaurant
tomorrow night.
Let's have a farewell dinner
fit for Kadir Korkut.
Are we really going to do this,
Ferit?
We have to do if, father.
Our last bastion was old friends.
And now, we throw them away?
There's no one like him, father.
Some live to solve problems,
some to rule.
And some live to destroy.
Only Kadir can kill the other two.
- What if he resists?
- He won't.
Antidote
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. I can hit it.
Wait.
Close your eyes.
Imagine your mother there.
- Mom's packing the luggage.
- No. She is there.
It's a coincidence.
Your gun is pointed right at her.
I thought you were sure.
- Come on, pull the trigger.
- Dad, what are you saying?
Pull it.
Never let your hatred blind you.
Sometimes, not pulling the trigger
is where the real strength lies.
- But you...
- Forget about me.
Your goal is to surpass me.
- Dad, I don't want to go.
- You're going, Kadir.
You'll become a man there.
A good man, Kadir.
Sometimes, hell is on earth.
Some endings are worse than death.
Like not keeping your promises.
Like having no mercy, no honor.
Promise me, son.
Will you be a kind man?
I will. I promise.
Some people look at you
all their lives, but never see you.
But Elsa, even though she will never
be able to look, still sees me.
Don't go unbuttoning your shirt
to show off to girls or something.
You're from Adana.
Karaisali district.
You won't be from
the exact same village as Cemal...
...but it will be close,
to help make you more likeable.
Don't act all smart, polite
and well-educated.
Try to be more like a thug,
rude in your own way.
That's exactly why
I got you that car.
One fuck up, and we'll find you
in a garbage can the next day.
They'll shoot you in the face...
...just so your mother can't look
at you one last time. Got it?
- I got it.
- You don't get shit. You don't.
Count them.
Cemal the Dark. His son, Ferit.
His enforcers;
Refik, Hamit, Yavuz, Recep.
- The hitman?
- Kadir the Demon.
Sure, Cem, say that!
Go to Kadir Korkut
and say "demon" to his face...
...then he can tear you
a new one.
- Relax, man. I asked for this job.
- Just keep your wits about you.
I know your mom, your dad.
Don't make me live with this burden.
Let me tell you the real deal:
If the operation fucks up,
which is very likely to happen...
...the Chief will mourn our failure,
but I will mourn your death.
Come, let's go in the other room.
- Did you see all of it?
- Yes.
- Well? Did you like it?
- I did.
- Don't lie.
- I swear.
- Did you close your eyes?
- I did everything you told me to.
What did you imagine?
I know, it must be strange for you.
I wouldn't want to force you
to do something you wouldn't like.
I just...
I remembered my childhood in Adana.
Before I went to Germany.
- So it was nice.
- It was.
And if he doesn't send Kadir
for the job?
Kadir has been with the family
for 30 years. He's completely loyal.
He will do it. He's the only man
feared by all the families.
- Because he's overrated.
- Because he's immortal.
There've been 8 hits in the last
10 years, each one he came out alive.
- Why?
- What can I say, man?
He's one of our "once-in-a-century
geniuses" we gift the world.
Only this lime,
it's a genius in killing.
I saw the man last week.
He didn't seem particularly impressive.
You're starling to get on my nerves!
The Demon isn't your mission.
Just go see Cemal,
infiltrate the family...
...record his conversations,
get out of there with your ass intact.
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you respected the guy.
Kadir is the last tiger in the jungle.
He's the last pure hitman in Istanbul.
He's been raised to kill and kill only.
And if you want to survive,
you'd better respect him too.
- I'm a bad man.
- I know.
I've done horrible things.
Unforgivable things.
I know.
I can't be in love with you
and remain that man.
I told Cemal I'm getting out.
Let's just go away. Tomorrow.
Let's just leave everything behind.
But what about your job,
your students?
If you'll come with me
and leave your life behind, so will I.
They're holding
a farewell dinner for me.
I need to attend it
and leave on good terms.
Then, I'll look for tickets to Munich
for tomorrow morning.
- Let's just start fresh.
- We will.
Stay close to Ferit.
He's the brains.
He'll never put himself in harm's way.
So, you'll be safe too.
Nobody knows who you are
except those in this room.
Even the department is unaware.
The village head in Sadikali
tampered with the records.
You're a member of the Kilic family now.
Stand behind everything you say.
As long as you remain confident,
you'll be fine.
Give me your ID.
Nobody has managed to convict Cemal
in 40 years.
If you do this, you'll become a legend,
they'll teach of you in the academy.
I'd like to keep her picture,
but you'd cuss me out.
Cem, buddy, forget about that girl.
Don't dwell on her. Please, don't drink.
- Don't worry. I'm fine.
- Come on. Let's get going.
Osman is from Karaisali as well.
The beloved old country...
From which part, exactly'?
Sadikali, boss.
- What did you say your last name was?
- Kilic.
The village head verified it.
I knew the grandfather of the Kilic
family. Ls Uncle Ali still with us?
He died in 1999, boss.
When I was young, he used to make honey.
The best honey in all of Adana...
Osman, son, stay close to Ferit.
If there's a problem, go to him.
Our men are short-tempered.
They're from
Karaisali, Kozan, Kadirli...
When we're young,
we all think we're tough guys.
Don't dare let me down!
Mr. Korkut, greetings!
My name is Osman.
They'll be here soon, they're
stuck in traffic. Please, after you.
I should have guessed.
The old man loves surprises.
But to invite the two men
he wanted me to kill only yesterday?
I'd have never thought
in a million years.
Everyone's here.
All the families, big or small.
The Dagdeviren family.
The Gokmusa family.
Even Madam Huma.
The whole hungry wolf pack.
But Istanbul's cake has three owners:
Civan of Haymana.
Hayri the Polite.
And of course, my godfather,
Cemal the Dark.
All have their seasoned killers
right beside them:
Yavuz the Blond.
The Tatar.
And my greatest rival,
The Italian.
Gentlemen,
behold the man of the night!
Kadir from Karaisali,
who is leaving us.
I told him this wasn't necessary,
but you know how my father is.
Don't worn! About it.
He's going to use your retirement
to forge a lasting peace.
I hope that's alright with you.
Yeah, mom?
He can't be delirious enough
to try and kill them all there.
- No. I'll be back later.
- Could he be brokering peace?
I don't know. It's late, shops are
probably closed. You go and sleep.
Listen,
if you sense anything odd, text me.
I'll be there with 20 cruisers.
Don't put yourself at risk.
Don't worry, mom. You always do that.
Have a good night now!
Enough with the calls from mom.
All my mojo is going down the drain.
We've been killing each other
for 20 years, and what have we gained?
You're right, Ferit.
Our side has gained nothing.
But your father, for some reason,
has always risen.
You were the ones who violated the code.
It's all on you.
Kadir's father and I
did away with that code 40 years ago.
When Mehmet and I came here,
you mocked us.
You made fun of us...
...asking how two rascals from Adana
would survive in Istanbul.
But what happened?
We killed Dagdeviren
and put fear in your hearts.
That's rude, Cemal!
Gentlemen. I'll say this only once.
Listen carefully.
We started as enemies,
but we can finish as friends.
Kadir is retiring today.
I propose we let
all the bad blood retire with him.
Assure me of Kadir's safety
once he's out of the game...
...and I swear, I will give you
a share in all of my businesses.
We'll divide everything into four.
In exchange for Kadir's safety,
we will all live in peace.
There are three families here.
Who is the fourth party?
It's me.
My father is making you the offer.
And he's not being greedy.
It's only natural that
we get a little extra.
There will be peace,
and Kadir will be safe.
We will divide everything like family.
- But you'll lose millions for Kadir.
- I'm willing to do so.
What can I say, Cemal'? I'm surprised.
This is very noble of you.
I accept!
Who am I to oppose what you old wolves
have agreed upon?
Just like that.
Fake smiles...
Neither a signature nor a lawyer.
Hands are shook, jokes are told,
and the war ends.
The only losers are kids like Osman...
...young men who have been dying
for the last 20 years...
...and their mothers who had raised them
with high hopes.
You haven't eaten a single bite
all night, Kadir.
But you're going to drink this.
Tonight, we drink to everything
Kadir has done, and has yet to do.
Now.
I've always hated lying to you, Kadir.
Forgive me.
Sir, we lost audio.
Let me go! Let go!
I said "Let go!"
If this were an ordinary night...
...we'd waste this little rat
and enjoy the evening.
But tonight is a different night, Kadir.
This is the night we poisoned you.
Do you remember how we met?
You chewed me out
like never before.
I had even! Reason
to stay away from you.
Your attitude, your words,
my anger...
But you know, sounds are
everything to me, my whole world.
And when I first heard your voice,
I felt met a prisoner.
If you enjoyed what you did,
I'd hate you.
But you're good, Kadir.
You may not feel that way...
...but you're a good man
who's done bad things.
Your hands are calloused from
gripping guns and throwing punches.
They're merciless.
They're so strong.
But you know
how they tremble when I hold them.
I have to go.
Kadir.
They tremble because somewhere
deep inside you, there is a good man.
That's the real Kadir,
the one who can find redemption.
That's the man I fell in love with.
The man who, no matter what,
hasn't forgotten who he is.
Do you trust me?
Ever since you protected me
from the rain.
I'll catch the plane.
You will be dead within six hours.
But there's a cure.
We have just taken the antidote.
And we have more of it.
If you do as we say,
you and the cop will live.
- You think I'm with him?
- No, Kadir.
You wouldn't dream of betrayal
even if they ripped you to pieces.
This little mole is a stroke of fate.
We found out about him today.
The two other bosses are content.
Your job would be easier
if you took the dying cop with you.
Or put a bullet in his head,
it's up to you.
We cut the taping at exactly the right
time. The police won't be suspicious.
You have six hours. Kill the two bosses,
and I'll give you the antidotes myself.
So, this is what your word is worth?
It's not words that get you to the top.
Your father also asked for my word,
in keeping you out of the game.
I had you kiss my hand
even before his funeral was over.
- I wanted that.
- You should want this as well.
With even! Second,
you die a little more.
Kadir.
The poison is some nasty stuff
that the Russians concocted in the 80s.
Hospitals and doctors won't do shit.
Six hours. Hum! up.
Otherwise, I'll be comforting
your pianist after you're gone.
Even! Time you step out of line,
I'll take one of her senses.
Her right ear, her left ear,
fingertips...
Ferit, that's enough!
Kadir, as God is my witness,
the girl will be safe.
Just go and do what you do best.
Why didn't you poison the bosses?
They were right here. You had them.
Kadir has a weak spot.
The others would never trust us enough
to eat or drink with us.
- What?
- Give me the keys.
Get in.
Wait, what?
- Have we really been poisoned?
- Shut up.
I need to report to HQ.
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.
If it was just you and me...
...I'd walk right back in there and
take them all down.
But it's not just you and me.
There is someone who mustn't be harmed
because of me. Do you understand?
The pianist.
The only thing that matters
is that she doesn't get hurt.
Do you understand?
You're serious!
You're really serious.
You want us to go,
poisoned, mind you...
...and kill two mob bosses,
the best-protected men in the city...
...despite dozens of bodyguards
and save your girl!
- Three.
- What?
Tonight is the last night
for all of them.
- Hello, Zafer?
- Where have you been, you little shit?
We've been waiting to hear from you.
We thought you got whacked.
We lost the signal, it's gone.
Maybe I turned the wrong way
and the cord got ripped or something.
Well, fix it immediately.
It's all quiet, but I have to stay put.
If anything comes up, I'll call you.
Keep your eyes peeled, Cem.
Please be careful! Hello? Cem?
Order something fatty.
Two servings of stuffed mussels...
...one mineral water
and French fries, if you have any.
What are we doing here?
Is this how you kill people?
By boring them to death?
I don't fear you, Kadir the Demon.
You're nothing but a heartless murderer
who deserves the chair.
- But to die here loitering...
- What's your name?
Cem.
Everything I tell you to do
has a purpose, Cem.
You'll eat
because it will slow the poison.
We are waiting
because we need to get ready.
- Why did you make me lie to HQ?
- Because they would only hinder us.
We'll start with Hayri the Polite.
He's the closest.
After he's taken out,
Civan will know.
That will be the point of no return.
Kill or be killed.
You realize
we'll never pull this off, right?
How's your acting?
What do you think?
6 feet tall, gorgeous.
A total knockout.
Almost too pretty to fuck...
...but if you did,
you'd feel like a champ.
One day, I was having a meal
at the resort.
She came over and sat down
across the table.
She said: "All your friends
have been hitting on me."
Aren't you interested?"
I said: "Do I have to be?
What might we have to do
with each other?"
She was all over me.
She asked me
to take a picture of her.
I said: "I'm no photographer."
I told her to take a hike.
She came back and asked me
why I wasn't hitting on her.
I said: "I am not a hitman,
I don't hit on people."
She started thinking of
how to come back.
She said: "Either you have a driver
or a boat at the marina."
if she actually knew...
So, then, I had to get back at her.
I looked at her and said:
"Where I come from,
there are many girls like you."
Nice one.
Then, Hayri came and took her.
Guys, good evening!
I was passing by
and couldn't help but overhear.
You were saying something.
I was by myself. I couldn't help but
listen to you. Sorry.
You were talking about
a real knockout.
And so, you had to send her to Hayri.
Why? The man has 800 prostitutes.
First, he must have pumped her
full of heroin, made her an addict...
...then threatened her relatives
and blackmailed her.
He'll probably force her
to work for 20 years.
What do you care? Who the hell are you?
Search him.
Bro, bro... Bro!
He's clean.
I'm just trying to empty the bottle.
Mind if I join you?
What are you, a faggot?
No. But I do have a faggot friend.
Don't you have one?
Shut the fuck up!
He doesn't speak much, my queer friend.
That grumpy bastard!
- But he's built like a beast.
- Enough! Get the fuck out of here!
Are you going to take my bottle
and throw me out?
I'm this close to shoving it
up your ass!
- Junkie! Don't make me whack you!
- But my friend...
- Fuck your friend!
- He's here.
Oh, shit... Oh, shit...
Look, look here.
If you want to live, shut up.
Kadir, now what?
Kadir, please don't.
For God's sake, please don't.
A lot of men will die tonight.
The kid needs to get used to it.
In the comics he has read,
in the series he has watched...
...enemies are tied and knocked out.
But not tonight. Not me.
What the hell is going on at this hour?
Which one?
What do you mean "it opened itself'?"
Where is Erkan?
Get your guns and go check.
Oguz!
Yes, sir?
Keep your eyes open, son.
Don't let anyone in.
Yes, sir.
What the hell am I doing here, man?
Cemal...
Shit!
You sneaky bastard.
Kadir!
Kadir, come on!
Come on, Kadir. Come on.
These screaming fools,
dying on the ground, they're whores.
They sell their youth and their strength
to monsters.
They protect scum
and poison the streets.
Hayri's hands are shaking because
he's never had to do his own dirty work.
He never took someone's life
while looking into their eyes.
He beat poor girls,
stole them from their families...
...destroyed countless lives,
but never in person.
Mr. Korkut, sir, let me go.
He's inside.
My mom is from Adana also.
We're from the same hometown. Don't...
- Will you hurt the girls?
- I'm not you.
I only hurt the unruly ones, Kadir.
The other bosses called me "pimp"
behind my back for 30 years.
And why?
All my girls have
weekly blood tests, Kadir.
They take classes in
speaking, dancing, foreign languages.
For example, these two are
the best masseuses in Turkey.
Don't you think
I deserve some respect'?
Are you done?
I'm going to ask you
one thing, Kadir.
I underestimated Cemal.
You tell him that when you see him.
This car is wrecked.
What the hell are we going to do?
- We have four hours left.
- I know that.
We're not taking a cab, obviously.
- This is Hayri the Polite's mansion.
- So?
Fuck me...
We really are going to die.
Say what you will
about the late Hayri...
...but you can't fault
his taste in cars and music.
"Ferit: Go to Nisantasi"
Drive to Nisantasi.
- How did you meet the pianist?
- Do you always talk this much?
A seasoned, merciless hitman.
A veteran of
sweat and blood soaked nights.
He shows no pity.
He's an expert in what he does.
But he falls in love.
The feeling's alien to him.
He feels weakened. He stumbles.
I'm curious about just one thing:
How did you two first meet?
Come on, tell me.
We are in the same boat now.
- Is that what you think?
- Well, yeah, it is.
You and me.
We're bound to lose, Kadir.
For instance, I already lost the woman
I loved the most.
We made each other miserable.
On our last fight,
she got so angry with me...
...that she got out on the street
in Nisantasi...
...and threatened to report me
to a traffic cop.
Knowing that I'm a cop.
That's how much I made her hate me.
I laid dozens of girls,
but I couldn't forget her.
In my dreams,
I keep reliving those past memories.
I try to do things differently,
so that maybe,"...
...when I wake up one morning,
we'll be together again.
But it's no use.
Don't look at me like that.
I have things to confess before I die.
- You'll have to bear with me.
- What's her name?
Did something ever happen to you
that you couldn't forget?
Something that no matter what you do,
even! Day you're reminded of.
I met Elsa two years ago.
She yelled, and scolded me.
You? Kadir Korkut the Demon?
Keep driving.
Don't push your luck.
I told you he'd make it.
Welcome.
We were just having a chat.
I was telling Elsa about
how we were always like brothers.
But it's time I get going.
Elsa will stay here tonight.
I got her the Presidential Suite,
out of respect for you.
Ferit, don't do this.
Hayri was unprepared.
But Civan is old school,
twice the man.
We'll need leverage.
You think too highly of yourself.
Don't underestimate Civan's men.
The Tatar is just like you were
10 years ago.
I can do this
without involving the girl.
It's good that you're confident...
...but the "raki" you drank
will start to take effect.
You'll start making mistakes.
I can't take that risk.
- Ferit...
- This is not a request.
I'll find you
after you take care of Civan.
"23 Missed Calls MOM"
Are you in danger? Talk to me.
Why did they bring me here?
How do they know me?
Kadir, please.
I'm not mad, just answer me.
I'm going to do everything I can
to be on that flight, Elsa.
I know. But you must tell me.
- If anything happens to me...
- Don't say that.
If anything happens to me,
I want you to promise me.
No! Don't ask me for promises!
You said that
you'd leave everything behind...
...and that it would be over tonight.
Keep your own promises first.
We all have a tender spot for someone.
Elsa...
Those who turn their backs and leave,
those who are left behind...
We're aware of our tender spots,
but we never share them.
And it hurts inside.
It hurts inside.
Kadir.
The women we can't embrace,
the promises we can't keep...
...places we have to leave from
when we want to stay.
Kadir, son.
Here, I peeled tangerines for you.
Hum! Up or Osman will eat them all.
When will you and dad arrive?
Once your uncle Cemal
drops you off at the airport...
...we'll drive to Istanbul
and then join you in Germany.
Come on now. Uncle Cemal is on his way.
Grab your luggage.
Don't let him see you with that
long face. He'll get upset.
Osman is staying,
why do I have to go?
Osman is just a little boy, Kadir.
Is he a big boy like you?
He isn't.
You should get to know the place.
You can show your brother around.
My brother...
Drive slowly on the back roads.
He's my son too, Mehmet.
Don't you worry.
And he's got a baby brother on the way.
- Do you still plan to call him Ferit?
- Yes. It's my father's name.
Be careful,
those named Ferit tend to be dangerous.
Just as long as
he takes after his father...
Don't forget your promise.
Have a safe trip.
We are all someone's weak spot.
We overlook their evil deeds.
They protect us.
Your men are dedicated.
They won't be able to stick with us
so easily in Asmali.
What if they see you making out?
- Are you crazy? My father would lose it!
- He sure would.
Bravo! Bravo!
Put the boss' daughter right
in the crossfire, great idea.
Go ahead, Kadir, shoot.
Kill her and flush us down the shitter.
Shoot, man! Come on! You shoot tool
Tatar, go right ahead and kill the girl.
Come on, Kadir. Back me up.
The kid is smart.
He's sharp as a razor.
He thinks quick and finds solutions.
But he's impatient.
That's the greatest weakness of youth.
Civan's men, on the other hand,
are patient and experienced.
No one should be beaten
for their peers to see.
My instincts take over.
This is my territory.
Just then, like Ferit said,
the poison starts to take effect.
I'd like to show the kid
that I could do it without killing...
...but my body betrays me.
I don't have the luxury of
dragging this out.
You know what this is about, Demon?
Whoever kills you
will make history.
Everyone knows that,
but their fear betrays them.
The only person that could kill you
is someone who didn't fear you.
And that's not you.
If Kadir takes out Civan,
I want you to take Kadir out.
My father
will not know of this meeting.
Ferit, Ferit, Ferit...
- Let me tell you about Turkish cheeses.
- France, be serious.
Turkish mob are just like
Turkish cheeses:
You just can't compliment them
enough...
...but at the end of the day,
they are disappointing.
It's like comparing your kasseri cheese
with parmesan.
Only Kadir matches my talent.
And if I am to kill him,
I need a good reason.
My brother, in his own way,
respects Kadir.
If he is to kill him,
he needs some convincing.
I don't have time to lose.
- Did you hear me?
- I did. Did you hear me?
My father thinks
Kadir can be controlled.
But he's just a dog.
Dogs resent
being betrayed by their owners.
They become aggressive.
We have no other choice.
Name a price.
You're starling to go too far.
No. Not this time.
This time, it's about respect.
You know what I want.
Istanbul is currently divided
into three pieces.
Hayri dealt in prostitution.
You'll take over that now.
Civan dealt in drug trafficking.
Risky business.
So?
We want what he has.
Do you think Istanbul
would ever accept a foreign boss?
I don't think so. I know so.
Kill Kadir.
You'll get what you want.
Kadir, I swear...
We shouldn't stop with Civan's daughter.
We should also get two beggars
and a transvestite in the car.
In fact, let's also get a midget. That
kind of crew could bring down anyone.
We could annihilate everyone.
But we need to round up more people.
We are undermanned.
Hop in.
"Hop in"? In case you didn't notice,
the car's a two-seater.
Kadir?
Are you kidding me?
- Get up.
- What?
- You're going to sit on my lap.
- Oh, really?
- Get out, girl.
- That won't happen.
It's like I am the hostage here.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I couldn't fulfill your fantasies.
Don't get sassy.
It was Kadir's idea.
Why are they pulling us over?
How should I know, Kadir! Probably
to peek inside and have a laugh.
Don't speed up.
Let me try to handle it.
If you can't,
you know what I'll do.
They are just doing their jobs.
It's the night patrol. They're innocent.
- Then, don't try. Do it.
- Alright, alright.
Hey there.
Get back in your vehicle!
We just went to pick up my sister.
And I needed some fresh air.
Good evening! How are you?
Are you going to use me for leverage?
You know my father.
If you're doing this for money,
let me go, or you'll regret it.
We're not doing it for money.
Go ahead, shout if you want.
Cw for help. Shout.
Maybe they'll come through.
Maybe they'll get lucky.
Or maybe they'll die too.
- How's work? Are you alright?
- Move, move!
- Have we been drinking tonight?
- Yes, we have been.
Really, I am a cop. Just, I don't have
records because of my assignment.
Alright, man. Stop panicking.
We'll place a call and find out.
You reek of alcohol.
Did you get in a fight?
What's that got to do with anything?
Believe me, I'm undercover.
Alright.
Get your hands off the car.
- Mind if we do a breathalyzer test?
- I do.
Then we'll need to draw blood
at the hospital.
- Will you now'?
- License and registration, please.
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Zafer, listen to me.
You dumb-ass, they took Hayri down!
Where were you? I thought you were dead!
I don't have time to explain, Zafer!
You need to reach a patrol unit
right now, or two officers will die!
- Waif, what officers?
- Do what I said, Zafer!
This time, Cem won't forgive me.
It'll take too long by radio. Give me
the plate number, I'll try their cell.
This is the tipping point.
Mr. Hayri, your license please.
I feel the poison.
There's only one option.
Zafer! Come on!
I don't want to, but I must.
- Come on!
- Damn if, they're not answering!
Kill or be killed.
Don't kill him!
This time...
...I won't...
...be beaten!
- Will he live?
- Yes. With a limp.
And the car?
We need a distraction.
You can't be serious.
Dispatch, 412 is at the location.
We're near the suspected vehicle but...
Stop! Stop! Don't go there!
Stop! It's going to explode!
Don't go there!
Don't go there!
It's going to explode! Stop!
Shit! Floor it! Go!
Kadir. Where are we headed?
Kadir, who is Haci Emmi?
What is Haci Emmi?
Is it a restaurant? A kebab place?
A record store?
Where are we going, to Unkapani?
Haci Emmi...
I feel the poison. God damn it!
Kadir, who is Haci Emmi?
He's the cranky old man
my dad sent me to 40 years ago.
The only man I trust.
Haci Emmi.
It's time to take your medicine.
I'm busy, go away.
You didn't take them on time
yesterday either. Please.
Hacer, I'm from the old world.
Back when your father swam
in your grandfather's balls...
...I was hanging out with made men!
Get out of here before I smack you!
Go!
Go and open the door.
Go and open the door. Go.
God's curse on me.
Who is it?
Kadir?
You hooligan, come here!
- Who are these?
- Civan's daughter, and a cop.
What have you gotten into?
Never mind the cop, what are you
doing with Civan's daughter?
- Emmi...
- Civan has no mercy, no remorse.
Emmi...
Look, I can still shoot a gun.
I've just fixed Cemile.
I'll go into the night
if you're in trouble. Are you?
- Is my "down!" ready?
- Yes. Fiona is in the back room.
Go on, get her.
Hold on, Kadir, let me take this off.
Go get her. Fiona is quiet.
The poison is killing us.
We're down to our last 1.5 hours.
I feel even! Heartbeat.
I don't have the luxury of
dragging this out.
This night is my last.
But memories still haunt me.
Painful, bittersweet memories...
Faces I've not seen in years,
my family from another life...
This is his father Mehmet.
He left his village
and conquered all Istanbul.
I raised that lion back there!
I protected him for 10 years
in Germany.
You know what he said
when he first saw me?
Of course,
I was young and handsome back then.
He looked at me and got mad.
"You look neither like a hadji
nor like an uncle."
Oh, dear God...
- Girl, why is he wheezing?
- I was running... I'm okay.
Hacer, come here.
Yes, Kadir.
Whatever he wants, however
he wants... Move to a nice place.
- Take good care of Emmi.
- Thank you, Kadir. Don't you worry.
- Give me your blessing, Emmi.
- You have my blessings, Kadir.
Don't watch the TV, watch me.
- Say it.
- Emmi, they will be here soon.
Say if, hooligan.
Cemile...
You've been here
for two weeks now.
You're going to learn it all.
- "My parents will come."
- Good job.
You need to learn
to get accustomed to this place.
Emmi, they're going to come.
Let's stop it.
Your father is antsy as well.
But I miss him, you know'?
- I'm your relative from Kozan.
- I know. You told me when I came here.
Uncle Cemal?
Uncle, where are my parents?
Kadir...
My dear Kadir...
The day
I put you on the plane...
...it started raining in the evening.
Your father was driving.
I couldn't tell you
without being by your side, Kadir.
I wished to die.
I asked God to take me, just like
He took your mom, your dad and Osman.
I'd rather die
than to have to tell you this.
God didn't kill me,
so may He be my witness:
You're my own flesh and blood, Kadir.
You're my son too.
It's hard to kill a man.
Looking into their eyes and
taking their lives right then...
Well, it's hard.
- Bapir, what if Demon comes here?
- Let him.
- What happened to Hayri...
- Are we the same as that pimp?
Of course not, sorry.
Dogs bark, lions keep quiet.
Hayri was a dog, we are lions.
We used to be hitmen once.
We used to raise hell, just like Kadir.
I've seen his father:
Mehmet Korkut.
Now, he was the real Demon.
He'd conquer rooms he walked in.
Even! Woman wanted to be his,
even! Man wanted to be him.
40 years ago...
Those were legendary times.
Bapir, the Demon...
Enough with the fucking Demon!
Why fear death
when it's inevitable anyway?
- Boss, he's here.
- What?
He's out front, boss.
He's got Dilan with him.
Dilan?
- Use the girl as a shield.
- No.
Kadir...
Kid, there are worse things than dying.
- Like what? What could it be?
- Like having no honor.
Alright, Polat.
- Bapir, I can take him.
- Don't even think about it.
Pull that trigger, and
I'll burn your family in a mosque.
What do you want?
First, I want your men to
put down their weapons.
- And then what?
- Your life.
Our family also deals in gambling,
Demon.
I've seen bluffing faces
for 70 years.
You might be a good executioner,
but you're no gambler.
You're just like your late father,
aren't you?
You guys don't kill innocent people.
I underestimated Civan.
I never thought he'd gamble
with his own flesh and blood.
I was wrong.
Just like Cemal,
he's a boss first, a father second.
He would risk anything for power,
even his own daughter.
Kadir, what are you doing?
Now take him down.
This is it.
What about me, Civan?
Do you know me well?
Did you know my father?
- What are you doing?
- I'm playing my role.
I'm sorry.
Civan of Haymana! What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?
Who the hell are you, scumbag?
Osman Kilic. Cemal the Dark's right arm.
More demonic than the Demon himself.
Easy.
Forget innocent people,
I wouldn't spare even an angel.
In my world, everyone is evil scum.
Even your daughter!
Put your weapons down on the ground!
Do it!
Put them down slowly.
That's more like if, Bapir.
When the girl walks,
they'll draw spare weapons.
- I know.
- Okay.
- Wait a minute. What?
- We can do it.
- Don't be crazy.
- This is the point of no return.
Kill or be killed.
Can you change the station?
The radio, damn it!
You aren't that old, Civan!
Change the station
and crank up the volume.
Are you crazy, kid?
I am crazy! I'm a drunk!
I have poison in my veins! Come on!
I might as well die
to some fast music.
When I give you the signal,
run to the right and don't stop.
And...
...if we make it through all this alive,
maybe we'll grab a coffee together.
Although, this father killing stuff
could get between us.
We're up against 15 people!
They're all heavily armed,
and look at what I have!
- You have a purpose.
- Which is?
- To be the bait.
- What?
We go out on my count.
One, two, three...
Kadir, you made me do stupid things
all night, but this one takes the cake.
I was wrong, Demon.
You're good at gambling too.
Kadir... My shoulder...
The bullet grazed you.
The men?
The ones who survived jumped,
and the dead ones I threw overboard.
They say alcohol is
the mother of all evil.
You know what I say?
There's no love like a mother's love.
- Save your strength.
- Are you worried because I got shot?
Yeah, you are!
The Great Kadir Korkut
worried to see a rat die.
- You're not going to die.
- We're all going to die.
Maybe the poison will kill us two
in an hour and a half...
...but in the end,
we're all going to die.
But hey, at least we lived, Kadir.
We saw and we conquered.
How much have you lived?
25 years, tops.
Well, I lived.
I loved and lost.
If only she'd call me once...
If I saw just one call from her,
instead of Zafer's 50 missed calls...
...I'd get up on my feet
and get better that very second!
We don't have much time left.
The poison is really kicking in.
What was the girl's name?
Tell me where
you learned to fight like that...
...and I'll tell you her name.
Never mind then.
Fine.
None of us should say anything.
We'll find the answers
in our imagination.
Kadir Korkut, ex-special forces.
Kadir Korkut, street fighter trying to
survive on the streets of Germany.
Kadir Korkut,
the mysterious yacht captain.
I like that one.
At that moment, because he shed blood
with me, Cem becomes my brother.
- I brought you something to drink.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- You understand Turkish, right?
- Yes, but I speak poorly.
Look, you don't have to worry.
We're only keeping you here
for your own safety.
You get that, don't you?
I could break this door down.
In fact, I could even pull my gun and
start shooting, and no one would care.
Do you understand?
So just open the door.
I'm not working right now, man.
What are you looking at?
I told you, I'm not working. Piss off.
Are you always this kind
towards working people?
Hey! Stop!
Hey! Stop! Hey!
You do realize that he won't give us
the antidote, right?
He'll act like he will,
and then, he'll have us killed.
- I can take you to the police station.
- No way!
You're wounded.
I am, but we are in the same boat.
Listen to this, Kadir.
It's coming.
Well, that's it.
- Did you pick your name yourself?
- What? Oh, you mean "Osman"?
I thought it would fit a man
from Adana.
- Do you know anyone by that name?
- I do.
I did.
- Who was he?
- My little brother.
Finish your glass.
This is a celebration.
A farewell gift
in honor of your and Kadir's going away.
You know, the tenacity
love creates in someone is just amazing.
My father always taught us
that love was a vulnerability.
And he was right. Love is
the greatest vulnerability on earth.
It makes you worry.
You develop fears
that you never had before.
Love...
Lust, on the other hand...
That's different.
Lust is more carefree.
It drives you to do wrong.
You stop caring.
In the world of powerful men, Elsa,
we serve lust.
You want to know what's really sad?
Even if we resist lust, or despise it,
we are condemned to give in to it.
There's this moment when
our own body betrays us.
"I'm supposed to hate this",
the mind screams...
...but you enjoy it anyways.
That is a horrible but sweet moment.
We are all slaves to our lust, Elsa.
Whether we like it or not.
Because lust represents
the reality of mankind:
Instinct, satisfaction, death...
We're nothing but monkeys
with bloody hands, Elsa.
All of mankind.
Yes, father?
Alright.
Alright.
You know, I also love Kadir.
I always have.
That's why, after he dies...
...I'll make sure that what he has
becomes mine.
Just like he did to me
ever since we were little boys.
Get ready and come downstairs.
- Officer...
- Cut the crap, you piece of shit.
Istanbul has turned into
a pool of blood.
Hayri is dead,
Civan took off on his boat.
I've been looking for you for
four hours. This is all my fault!
I put a depressed drunk undercover
beside the Demon!
Zafer, just listen to me for a minute!
I'll listen to what, huh'? What?
I don't care about your excuses anymore.
- If you take us in, I'm going to die.
- You'll be perfectly safe with us.
It's not up to you, man!
Cemal poisoned us.
We have an hour left to live
unless we drink the antidote.
How will you face my mother?
What will you tell my folks?
"Cem had one last chance,
but I suspended him."
And I put Kadir Korkut in lockup.
"They died in the morning,
foaming at the mouth."
Not that the girl would care,
but what would you say if she calls?
That I called out her name while
I was dying, but she never called?
One hour, Zafer. That's all.
I'll get us proof and bring Kadir in,
I promise, please.
Do you have a piece on you, Demon?
I'm out of the game now.
Come on, buddy. Please.
These aren't the guys we're looking for.
Stand down.
What are you looking at?
What's with the long face?
This is not like burning tents.
Come on.
Are you alright?
I feel fantastic.
Kadir, let me tell you something.
I don't think you are a demon.
No way. You are top notch.
No, you are top notch
to say that.
Let's go save your lady.
Each breath I take burns my lungs.
My legs are slow,
my hands are weak.
I have the taste of blood in my mouth.
After you die, I'll make sure
your tale lives on, Kadir.
My only rival, sole equal.
You almost did the impossible.
Kadir! Why?
Equal circumstances.
Poor Kadir.
Kadir, what are you doing?
All your powers and senses
are under siege.
Poor, helpless Kadir.
All your bastions are conquered,
all your shipyards are intruded.
You're Fonda, I'm Bronson,
and this is the final scene.
Armies disbanded...
Maria! Do you ever wonder why
epic gunslingers wait on the draw'?
It's because
to draw immediately is a weakness.
What matters is
to draw later, and still win.
Kadir!
Kadir!
Sleep, Kadir.
Sleep in death's comfortable silence.
Excuse me. What are you doing?
I was here before you.
- Are you German?
- Yes.
- The first cab is mine.
- I doubt it.
Who do you think you are? I heard
your footsteps, you cut in front of me.
I'm not denying that. I'm going to
take your cab, I'm in a hurry.
Everybody's time is valuable.
I've been standing here for 20 minutes.
I don't know
why you're in a hum! But...
- You wouldn't want to know.
- No, please, do tell me.
- There is violence involved.
- I don't care.
You might as well be the devil himself,
but you will wait your turn.
You're in a foreign country,
you're blind...
...and possibly the most dangerous
man in the city is standing next to you.
Oh, I'm sorry,
was I supposed to be afraid?
Was the poor blind girl
supposed to cave in?
- What are you doing?
- Let's share the cab.
- What?
- I thought you weren't afraid.
Why would I hold your arm?
You're neither my grandpa nor my date.
I was born in Karaisali.
Men from there are gentlemen.
Apparently not!
- It's not raining.
- Wait for if, it will soon.
Do you still have
one last fight in you, Kadir?
One last act of defiance?
Disappointment.
Shoot, you son of a bitch.
Shoot, shoot.
I've never liked guns.
They're too unrefined.
Just like pussy-whipped men
who draw on the wounded.
And who tn! To disguise...
France, just finish him.
...their incompetence.
France!
Here I come.
I will do you a favor.
Witness the fall of a legend
before you die.
What a shame.
Kadir.
You're not the best.
Because...
Because...
Because what?
Because we're...
We're the worst.
We're the worst, Francesco.
We're poison.
No! France!
And there's only one antidote.
Burn in hell.
Poor Kadir Korkut.
You want to stay in the dark.
You want to go to an eternal sleep.
The sweet caresses of death
are harbingers to eternal agony.
But no, these are not
the feminine fingertips of death.
Your demons smell of
cheap cologne and hair pomade.
Your torment in this world
isn't over yet, Kadir.
Instead of falling into the fire,
you rise to the skies.
But there's someone
ripping through the silence.
Not my mother, but someone else.
Kadir...
It reminds me of an afternoon.
Kadir, wake up.
Asphalt, car horns and
the smell of rain.
Kadir.
A strange, happy memory.
Kadir...
Do you remember my 10th birthday?
People talked so much
about your first hit...
...that it was no longer
my birthday party...
...but a celebration of Kadir's
first kill for my father.
It hurt me.
Just before blowing out the candles,
I looked at my father.
He was so busy talking to you...
He was so busy talking to you...
...that he didn't even wish me
happy birthday all day.
A terrible feeling...
Hatred inside such a little boy...
It stays with you.
But you earned this.
Take the antidote, drink it.
Go ahead. No tricks.
Go on, drink it.
Kadir...
I thought I'd go to heaven...
...but there can only be one place
where the nurse is Kadir Korkut.
Kadir.
By the way, I also poisoned Elsa
back in the hotel room.
You should drink up of course,
but that's the last vial...
...and it's up to you to decide
who lives and who dies.
Only someone like Ferit
could plan this.
Only he could rip away
my last chance for happiness.
- I was an older brother to you.
- You were.
- I watched over you, protected you.
- True.
Your father was like a father to me.
I killed for you.
True.
In return,
I'm giving you the chance to live.
Don't be greedy, Kadir.
Just as long as you sacrifice
your scar-faced lover.
Poor Kadir...
All bastions conquered.
One last sanctuary remains.
Your wrath.
I tried Elsa. Really, I did.
But this savagery is my final
masterpiece. My dark symphony.
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo. It was a perfect show.
But it doesn't matter.
It's either you or her.
One of you will die tonight.
It doesn't matter!
As I fire the last bullet,
the red blob of goo is no longer human.
Then again, he never was.
- Kadir, the poison...
- You need to drink the antidote.
- What about you?
- Please... Please...
Kadir... Please, Kadir...
I'm sorry, Elsa.
For entering your life and
for not being able to end this madness.
I need to put a stop to this.
What?
Give her the antidote.
Protect her.
Kadir!
I'd hold her one last time,
but my hands are cold.
I'd look at her one last time,
but my eyes are dark.
Sometimes, hell is on earth.
In answers you should never know.
But you still need to ask
the questions.
You made it here for dawn, Kadir.
With each dawn,
the world renews itself.
As if nothing happened the day before.
- Without sin, without worry...
- Face me.
- Ferit?
- He's dead.
I didn't know that
he poisoned the girl, Kadir.
Face me.
You can't shoot me in the back,
can you?
You're compelled to look me in the eyes.
My honorable Kadir...
- Why did you do it?
- I already told you.
- Tell me the real reason!
- Kadir...
I'm thinking, I'm trying,
but I can't come up with an answer.
Tell me. Explain everything!
Some things
should remain unknown, Kadir.
Sometimes, a sweet lie
is more merciful than the cruel truth.
I was your son!
Only, I never called you "dad", just to
not upset Ferit when he was little
That's how much I loved you.
Ferit was my flesh and blood.
But that boy was born evil, Kadir.
As if Lucifer
got under the sheets one night.
As if he were the father and not I.
Punishments happen
here in this world, Kadir.
Whatever we did in this world,
we must pay for them here.
Cemal is waiting for us.
Let's get going.
We got in over our heads, me and Cemal.
Too much blood was spilled.
We have to hide you all.
That's why I sent Kadir away separately.
You and Osman will go together.
That's the safest way.
- Haci will protect you all.
- What about you?
- Zeynep...
- Hush. And when will you arrive?
When everything's safe.
Don't worry,
everything's going to be alright.
He's a scoundrel just like you.
I should go
and get some water for the trip.
Alright.
Osman, bring me the other bottle, son.
Come on, we are leaving.
Zeynep!
Osman...
Cemal! Watch out!
They're here!
Osman! Get inside! Cemal!
Watch out.
I put Kadir on the plane, Mehmet.
- You lie.
- I swear to God, I did.
- Osman!
- Cemal...
- Cemal...
- Osman, kiss your father's hand.
May you be greeted by many
the same way.
Cemal, I'm begging you...
Cemal...
He's not scared, Mehmet, look.
The boy isn't scared.
- Like you. Like Kadir.
- Cemal...
We killed one of the
three bosses, Mehmet.
Istanbul wants blood.
It was either you or me,
what else could I do?
If your household fell,
they'd give me my own family.
Just think about it.
I never mentioned Kadir.
I won't touch him, Mehmet.
They think you only had one son.
He won't know about any of this.
As God is my witness,
I'll raise him as my own son.
- Don't get him involved...
- He will be, Mehmet.
That's the cost of living.
A member of the Korkut family
will be my enforcer.
My own angel of death...
He'll find out one day...
He won't, Mehmet. He won't.
When he does, remind him of his promise
to me. You will see me in his eyes.
- What promise?
- He'll know.
What was little Kadir's promise?
For 40 years, even! Time I saw you,
I thought about all I had done.
Even! Dawn I awoke to,
I asked myself.
You thought it was tonight, but
my betrayal was actually 40 years ago.
I sent all the rest of the men home.
The building is empty.
Kill me and leave here.
But my dying wish is that you tell me
what your promise was.
What was the promise
you made to your father?
Kadir, answer me!
Kadir! Don't walk away!
Answer me!
Answer! Answer!
Sometimes, hell is on earth.
Sometimes,
your own conscience is your hellfire...
...and your own memories
are your demons.
Because hell truly knows
how to hurt us.
But the kid is smart.
The Demon has died.
His heart has stopped.
The poison has done its job.
But they don't give up.
They fight for Kadir.
The one, I love more than life itself.
The other, I see as my brother reborn.
But they'll be safer without me.
Because
sometimes, hell is on earth.
In goodbyes, in departures,
and in sins that must be paid for.
