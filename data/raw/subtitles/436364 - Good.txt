BERLIN, APRIL 1937
Dr. Halder, the commander Bouhler 
is waiting.
Do not know what it is, you know?
What?
The letter I received.
He said: "Committee of the Reich 
Registration for Scientific ... "
"In Serious Hereditary Diseases." 
Exactly.
I have no idea what 
it may have to do with me.
You are suggesting that 
there was a mistake?
Heil Hitler.
Dr. Halder?
-Chose one o'clock bad? 
-Yes.
No. I had to clear 
some lessons, but ...
It's not every day that is called 
à Führer's Chancellery.
Indeed.
Sit.
As President of the 
Censorship of the party ...
it is my duty to keep an eye 
in modern literature ...
to ensure that it incorporates 
the spirit of National Socialism.
I called here to 
clarify your point of view ...
In a matter of concern 
person to the Führer.
His novel.
Raises controversial issues 
on the subject of law à life.
Some of its conclusions 
Sao revolutionary.
Are?
Suppose that the views 
expressed here are their.
A few years that I wrote.
Naturally, 
is a work of fiction.
Return to him. Lotte!
-Is the lesson of Erich. 
May 1933
-But I know the answer. It's easy. 
Return-to him.
You are an angel for 
cook again.
I know I am.
You do not even matter?
No.
When I start, 
I can not stop.
Okay.
 John! 
Stop it! </ I>
God! Lotte, come here.
 John! </ i>
Continue stirring slowly. 
Good girl!
, Johnnie! 
-I am going, mother. </ I>
Is beating à door.
Theodore.
-You do not hear me knocking? 
-Yes.
A mathematician! 
Exactly from whom we need!
Helen, her father is here.
-You see I came. 
-Hello, Dad.
Hey, John ... 
John!
Erich, it helps!
John, I talked to you ...
have to leave this apathy.
I just talked with the dean.
What is paving?
One thing with vegetables ...
-Goulash! 
-Yeah.
There will be changes in the university 
before you can imagine.
Promotions will automatically 
for members of the party.
If you're not careful, 
will be without jobs.
 John! </ i>
Yes, mother!
Look at the onion.
Coming!
-I. 
-Where were you?
Do not let me lead, Johnnie.
It is Theodore. 
You remember, the father of Helen.
I am sorry to know that 
was hospitalized again.
Helen, you can raise, please?
Must-pee again? 
-I could not handle.
Oh, mother!
In a language that we know ...
replace the opacity of sounds 
the transparency of ideas.
Transparency of ideas, 
relativity of perception ...
music and faith, memory and guilt.
The most powerful memories São 
those caught unintentionally.
A random noise ...
tapping a spoon on a plate ...
while he expects 
library ...
and suddenly, 
a wave of happiness to them.
He returns in time, transported 
a train stopped in the field.
You are watching the sun light 
a row of trees à distance.
Outside, a rail strike 
a wheel with a hammer ...
and is an echo of that sound ...
How wonderful!
Better stop here for today.
Go take a look. Can go.
Prof. Mandelstam, should 
do something with respect to that ...
talk to the dean.
Please, John, I do not think 
a good idea for any of us.
Incidentally, I have to go further.
As Head of Department, 
I have to do with that ...
the works of authors 
outcasts are removed.
Not only the library but ...
of their curriculum.
Authors that you have in mind?
Proust, for starters.
Because he is French?
John, please 
is not covered.
What if I do not obey the order?
Then I would not have another option 
if you resign.
Crap!
Yes?
I saw your light on. 
I was leaving the library.
I need your advice.
My name is Anne Hartman. 
Rs watch their lessons.
Yes, I noticed you. 
But not in my way.
Should ask who I am. 
Or maybe not.
History. This is what I should be 
doing, but I do not know why.
Looks have nothing to do with anything.
Spend the day sitting 
a stuffy auditorium ...
listening to a boring old ...
It was not what I meant.
I am here because of 
their classes. Sao alive.
I heard what I said 
to Prof.. Mandelstam.
More people should 
defend what you believe.
In-believer, Miss. Hartman? 
-That 's.
I know what I like, which is good. 
I feel that with passion.
But when it comes to ideas, 
They do not seem real.
Perhaps this is why. 
Here at the university.
To try to connect that passion.
Worked with you?
I hope so.
Yes I think so.
That is what I believe.
Books.
Look old-fashioned way, right?
Maybe they are right. What about 
old books has to do with life?
Who knows? Maybe 
liberating play them out.
Start again.
And here I am, writing 
another, making the stack grow.
His novel ... and about what?
A man who kills his wife ... 
because he loves, you know?
She has an incurable disease.
What horror.
Yes, I know. Who will 
read something so depressing?
"What horror" in 
sense of "poor thing".
It is clear that people will 
want to read. It seems so romantic.
Killing for love.
I  sowing at the Neckar 
I sowing at the Rhine </ i>
 Now I have a love 
Now I have no </ i>
What advances  sow 
If nothing is mine? </ I>
I love this song.
The problem is that 
is my imagination.
Really?
It has grace, Maurice.
How long 
this is happening?
I do not know.
Few months.
Three months? Six months?
I do not know.
May be from the end of January?
So, I guess. Why? 
Do you think there is some connection ...?
Put the country 
in the hands of a madman.
Refuge in fantasy 
can be a ...
rational response to 
an irrational world.
-Why sing? 
-I do not know.
No idea?
And why not?
To be honest, I'm without ideas. 
I spent all day confined here ...
listening to the fantasies 
perverted sexual ...
of housewives so ugly that 
would be better never know.
I'm crazy about 
a cold beer ...
and a gossip, 
I need not consider anything.
The point is that 
I am her teacher.
It is a position of trust, 
as its with their patients.
Or a majority of doctors 
with their patients.
That is not the point. 
The question is, sleep with her?
The issue is not whether 
or not slept with Anne ...
-and, by the way, did not sleep. 
-Jesus Christ!
Why, when the idea 
I went through your head ...
I started listening to Mahler?
Interesting have chosen 
a Jewish person.
It took the 
idea? It is Aryan.
Not that I do not think 
the Jewish attractive.
Mahler was Jewish.
-He has become. 
-It is not Jewish.
The question ...
Please change the subject. 
I am not involved in his neurosis.
I get it. When 
disturbed, listening to music.
Some of us in the real world 
have much to worry about.
Never seems to worry 
with nothing ... not very.
No?
As a model of narcissism 
pathological, the subject is fascinating.
The problem is that, 
rather than tie it on a couch e. ..
give him electric shocks, 
à might all follow what he says.
A while, Maurice.
Hitler is a joke.
He will not last.
I would be surprised to know that 
Führer examined his own book?
The Führer?
I wish you read this.
One of our tasks 
the Chancellor is ...
dealing with the letters 
to our leader for ordinary citizens.
They give, as you can see, 
a concept unmatched ...
the spirit of renewal 
live today in our country.
It is well ... awesome.
Really.
The Führer has received several 
letters from relatives of those ...
"unfortunate" with 
irreversible shortcomings ...
requiring special permission 
to end the suffering of them.
And that is where you enter.
I?
We need to write 
a trial, Halder ...
following the same line 
of thought of his novel:
The defense of a smart approach 
of euthanasia for humanity.
I therefore called here?
Why else would be?
I am not an expert.
My mother has a 
chronic disease: tuberculosis.
Well, the Führer said 
which was written from my heart.
Dr. Goebbels also 
was very impressed.
He thought it would 
excellent basis for a movie.
For me, impressed me 
with the humanity of his writing.
Thank you.
So, is all you want from me, 
a test?
Naturally, it will be well paid 
for their work.
But more than that, 
their participation would be for me ...
a guarantee that the issue 
remains of humanity ...
the central point of our approach.
Yes
Maybe I can write something 
for the next week.
Excellent ... 
One more thing.
Before you ask here, 
we examine, of course, your data.
His performance in front in 1918, 
his work at the university ...
all more or less in order ...
except for one oversight.
Not joined the party.
I discussed this on several occasions, 
with my father-in-law, Dr. Brunauer.
He is a prominent member 
in our district. But at the time ...
I already spoke of the disease 
of my mother, e. ..
my life was a little ...
complicated.
I am an idiot. I speak 
with you, but it was gone.
Then I thought about coming here.
-The tram took and I thought ... 
-Give me your stuff wet.
Could not appear 
without being invited.
Neither should know 
I have your address.
Then went up and down the street trying to 
decide what to do, and then ...
Now that is here ...
sit down.
Sorry ... Ready.
Excuse the mess.
We would have a maid ...
if we could afford.
I dry it here.
Maybe, if my book is published, 
one day.
Want something to warm up? 
There should be a bottle of sherry ...
somewhere.
Unless my father-in-law 
has emptied.
Sorry, but we cognac.
Yes, please.
My wife was lie.
Not that it is already late. 
She likes to go to bed early ...
put in the reading day.
It is very?
I walked in thinking you said about 
find something to believe.
And you ... found something?
I think I found.
But does not solve my problem.
Problem ... with History?
People. That is what I understand, 
are the people who matter.
They are much more 
fascinating than the ideas.
Well ..
you could switch to a 
course of more vocational nature.
I want to be with you.
I would like to be part of 
all my students this question.
Has not had an erection? Damn!
Maurice!
What? Not at all? 
Or a contraction?
Not entirely.
It has no grace. Maurice. Maurice!
-You drank too much, right? 
-Yes.
-You are under pressure. 
-Yes.
-I was a little anxious. 
-See?
It was time that I 
was not anything so ...
impulsive.
And Helen was there.
Ah, yes, the lovely Helen. 
How is she?
I could not sleep. 
I wanted to play something.
-I went up. 
-All right.
It is ... is one of my students.
It dripping, poor creature.
You can not go home at night 
like this. Arrange a bed.
He is well muffled?
She ... I gave a blanket for her.
Who will prepare the breakfast?
I prepared the breakfast.
You okay?
I have a brandy.
Come here.
What, John?
His father said I 
do not reach anywhere ...
if I am not affiliated with the party.
Typically, 
when my father says something ...
You do exactly the opposite.
And if he has reason?
I hate to see you agoniado well.
Have confidence in yourself.
You will do the right thing.
You always do.
I?
Listen.
I can not deny that 
I feel attracted to you.
But as 
Professor ... married man and ...
simply can not.
-What was that? 
-Must be the start of the parade.
What-stop? 
-We are not here for that?
No, was the most discrete 
I came à mind.
And they have to do 
more of a damn rallies.
Let's watch.
No. Not support 
this kind of thing.
I prefer to drop out before 
get stuck in the middle of it.
-Oh, please! 
-What if someone come in?
Let's say 
we met by chance.
-Why be here? 
-To see that this is uproar.
Everyone seems so happy.
Something that makes people 
happy can not be bad.
Something about it seems 
somewhat offensive.
The ideas behind it, 
or lack of them.
But feel this energy!
Only some people need to 
the best channel in the right direction.
-Believe that? 
-Yes.
Burn those books is shocking. 
But as you said ...
It would be liberating play 
and they all start from the beginning?
Come!
There is a huge difference between 
talk about anything and do.
Accurate! Men like you should not 
be closed by reading books.
Rs streets should go to help build 
a better country for our children.
Come on, please. Please!
Okay, just a little.
Seriously consider 
I join the party.
But I can not imagine ...
marching around, 
waving flags.
What I 
say is that ... I ...
Perhaps you are right.
It would be a waste to have a 
man like you in the troops.
Major Drobisch? 
Bouhler speaking.
I want you to know 
a person.
It's not every day that we receive a 
Link of the Chancellery of the Führer.
Do not work there, you know? 
I am not an academic.
Only an academic? Do not be ridiculous! 
Brandenburg served in the 24s!
But I did not see much action. 
Only I was called in 1918.
Well in time for last 
offensive. Nice time!
-Hope you're hungry. 
-No ... yes, yes.
As you know, the Kaiser had the Guard 
Imperial, his regiment of elite.
We have the "Schutzsfaffel.
The escort of the Führer?
It is a little more than that.
I am not suggesting that walk in 
footboard of a car with a gun.
We are interested in 
recruit the best kind of person.
Experts in 
their fields, such as you.
I'm not exactly 
a specialist.
This is what I like in you, not 
likes to brag, brag.
It is a quiet determination. 
The type of person we want.
Glad I have a high - 
esteem, but my fear is that ...
with my work at university, 
I can not help ...
The last thing we want is 
divert it from its valuable work ...
to form the minds of 
our next generation.
No, your post 
would be honors.
The greatest minds of 
country with us in spirit.
Helen ... was a 
something extraordinary.
And all because of 
book, you think?
It seems that they loved, for 
some reason that I know.
Helen!
I'm trying to tell you something.
How? What say?
 John! </ i>
 are you, John? </ i>
Yes
Go back to bed.
Maurice?
There you are.
I was beginning to think 
I was kidding her.
-Who? 
-From Helen, telling me here.
What does that mean?
Needed a place 
where work in peace.
Who is it?
Sorry, I'm a little distracted.
You have time to 
a quick drink. I had ...
-many queries canceled. 
-Actually, I can not.
-There is always time for one. 
-I can not, Maurice.
-You will not fall? 
-No.
-I will raise a second. 
-No. Because ...
I ... I'm working.
Holy God!
You okay?
Why not be?
Well, you are here 
and Helen is ...
Missing more than 
of habit, so to speak.
My couch is free.
I can not pay their fees.
But the rent of a 
single room, can you?
If I finish the test 
I am writing, yes.
Okay, 
I know when I want.
Maurice!
We find when 
things calm down, I promise.
Do not make me any favors!
I submit Anne.
Very nice, lady.
Oh, no, we are not ... 
Anne and me.
What wonderful place 
to a party.
John is on a secret mission 
to the Chancellery of the Führer.
It is a ... short essay 
that ... had to be written.
I-class university. 
-So, to know Theodore.
Bright.
One day, it would have been very pleased 
see you in a meeting.
But accept their duties 
as a national-socialist ...
is no excuse for 
duties of the absent husband.
I am concerned with the movement ...
when he embraces men 
of such moral weakness.
I need to explain. 
Dr. Brunauer is my father-in-law.
My wife and I separated.
And to think that you left 
Helen for this slut.
It need not involve Anne. 
The fault is mine.
Excuse me.
Anne.
Why do we leave? 
Is not you who is drunk.
Miserable!
Where are you going?
Elisabeth, honey, 
watch a moment of Anne.
I need to talk to John.
Do not have children, have? 
Not yet.
It is too young. I would 
endure another mother proud ...
is that your premium gabando 
ferinha won at camp.
For you do not know, 
but I need a drink.
No need to apologize.
If that is with us, John, 
the old rules not worth more.
Himmler ...
may seem a bank manager, 
but he has one merit:
Ideas and advanced 
about sex.
He wants us to pregnancy 
girls bent to the right and ...
so that they can 
donate a child to the Führer.
Well, it is our patriotic duty!
That is, if it is 
the right kind of girl.
Not that you have 
a problem in this field.
She is a real mermaid.
Really, no?
Frankly, Mom!
I'm undoing the packing.
Not in time. 
We have not left.
But I just got here.
No, Mom. Agreed here 
this morning, remember?
You are here for a long time, 
and now go home.
The house is on fire.
The house is not ...
My God!
Proceed.
-What are you doing? 
-I would fry the onions.
You must do this now?
I would do while you are here, 
to guide me.
There was a time when 
does not affect me much ...
say that you loved another woman.
But weeks ago, I began 
I fall for you again.
It is as if, suddenly, 
had acquired life.
Yes, it was what I felt.
I talked to my father. 
He made an awful scene?
I deserved it.
Does not support the idea of 
he thought ill of you.
He has every reason.
But he does not know how I am. 
Do not know what you stand!
Helen! Please, 
is not nice to me.
I'm not being nice to you.
Mom, what happened?
I was trying to go down.
-You okay? 
-Yes.
What did you do?
-Could not have expected? 
-I can not wait all day.
The piano is making me crazy!
Wait, Mom.
Come on.
-Are you all right? 
-Yes, I'm fine.
You gave me a fright.
-We will. 
-At last!
You will even out?
Helen, please.
I do not know what 
you have to talk.
-You said it was finished. 
-Stop it, Mom.
If I ask again 
you to stay ...
would say something?
I come back tomorrow to 
we talk, I promise.
But now, we 
put my mother in the car.
-He will not return. 
-Please do not target!
Had it been a good wife, 
That would not have happened.
How dare you?
It is a great wife, in a sense 
that you will never understand.
So why go?
I need to go to the bathroom.
Hell!
Is good, Mom.
Before we leave.
What is this place?
Said it was based.
A little water 
to take the tablets.
Certainly, water used.
Ready.
A beer for me. 
And to you, Mother?
Mother?
Water.
As we sit, 
at least, have a coffee, cake.
What the doctor said? 
You have to get stronger.
Beer and water, please.
That's it, thanks.
Beautiful here, no?
Give me all.
Free me from my suffering.
Do not talk like that.
Why not? For me 
There is nothing but pain.
His lungs are clear. 
So go home.
You just want to get rid of us, 
of me and children.
Are camping. Will be 
with us on weekends.
Everything is right.
Obviously, I do not want 
in their nest of love.
I told you a hundred times, come live 
us, if what you want.
I expected more from the 
roof that your bitch?
No, it is not what you want.
Find an apartment 
there close to you.
I have my own house, thank you!
I always thought that 
would make a good quarter.
Will not have to worry 
with the stairs.
Thanks.
Thank you for everything you did.
Do not say that.
Maybe I do not say enough.
Can I come as often as you like.
I spoke with Ms. Troller. 
She will make every day for lunch.
Who is a good boy?
A boy so good.
What are you talking about?
Days of glory when 
in esquivávamos of bullets.
When shied away from bullets?
In war. 
We were in the army together.
When?
Some twenty years ago.
You should have many, 
three, four?
I did not know was that soldier.
Just for a while.
Should have seen him in uniform. Sexy!
-Stop it. 
-People with the girls.
Maurice!
-I 'm exchange. 
-We can handle some towels.
How is your happiness 
home with the student?
You can call it Anne, please?
And she is no longer my student.
Very correct on his part 
have expected it to form.
I would not have me 
contained for so long.
-Then you approve? 
-Beautiful.
Obviously, one has 
fixation by the father.
-Are you jealous? 
-Certainly.
She needs a good shrink?
No. 
You will not bring it.
Do not get me wrong, but ...
I did not think that you would like.
Not me.
And what happened? What led 
you to seize the moment?
I do not know. I. ..
I'm full of energy lately.
I think that the promotion does not hurt me. 
Simply, I am happy.
What promotion?
I do not ...?
In fact, is nothing.
No, talk, come on. 
You can tell the uncle Maurice.
I was appointed head of the department.
This is great! Congratulations!
He said it would not be 
promoted unless ...
Crap!
You, too, no, Johnnie. 
-Well, just ...
Tell me that was by pure interest. 
That I can understand.
But do not say that 
agrees with them.
Whether I agree. 
The fact is that they are in power.
At least I'm doing something. 
If we want to change something ...
put them in the right direction, 
We can not à margin.
We? 
Who the hell is "us"?
I will not put anyone in the direction 
some more because I can not vote.
If not noticed, I am not a citizen.
Legally, I am not 
a complete human being.
So I'm à margin.
What will you do? A list 
where to find books to read?
Listen ... If you really 
is so pessimistic ...
that is not 1or 2years 
abroad, until the thing calm down?
There are many countries where you can clinic.
You do not have ties here.
I have links? I was born here.
I fought for this country. I am so German 
about you. How dare?
'Why should I go? 
And those wretched want.
Sorry ... You miserable.
Maurice!
This will help you to sleep, 
my love.
It is so bitter, baby.
OCTOBER 1938
Hold my hand.
I love you.
I love you too.
Cut!
Bravo!
Without his vision, none of us would 
here now, Prof. Halder.
Or rather "master"?
"Professor" is good, Minister.
Much of what we do here is 
superficial. Dreams for the people.
I know it, because 
examine each circuit.
But Halder has 
a message to us.
It is very gentle. Let me 
make my wife, Anne.
Indeed, the prototype 
Aryan's mother.
Congratulations.
We need to find another way 
to flow to his talent.
 The two blue eyes </ i>
 My baby love </ i>
 Now they sent me </ i>
 into the world </ i>
Honey?
It was beautiful.
What are you talking about?
-Come on. 
-You do not ...?
No.
The music.
Always knew 
You were brilliant, but ...
receive a compliment 
of the minister!
Do not believe him shake hands.
I am so proud of you!
-Take my wife back home. 
-Where you going?
Promised to see Helen and children.
-Now? 
-I will not take.
Erich is in trouble at school.
You will not see ...
No, no. 
Listen, I gotta go.
Please.
Anne ...
Great. You received my ticket.
Should not have been given to work.
It is not working. Sit.
An old favorite.
Amy is off?
Amy's gone for long.
-You need money? 
-The problem was not that.
Please, eat.
And what was the problem with Amy?
I can not employ Aryans 
less than 45years.
Sure.
Do not call you here to do 
a fiery speech. T matter.
Some small things are 
almost funny. So ridiculous!
They took my 
typewriter!
I do not know how I expect 
I turn. You know my letter.
Totally unreadable. 
Even for a doctor.
Very long. 
Do not think it would.
If I knew that would make dinner, 
would have thought twice!
-Sorry. Is bad, no? 
-No, I'm kidding.
I will play out. 
What my idea!
But ...
have something 
à which will not resist.
Ready?
Of Epstein?
Is there any other 
cheesecake in the world?
Pass the plate.
A bit of the plum brandy 
to follow.
Enjoy.
Tasty?
Divine!
What do you want?
Documents to leave the country.
Believe me, you do not 
need to leave the country.
It was his suggestion.
Well .. If you decide to 
to do so, there are official channels.
I will take everything I have.
Let me know how much will 
lead the country? You know?
You idea? 
10DM.
10marks, and as I 
I worked for everything.
Well, you could 
move some chopsticks.
It is a little different now. 
If I could, I would.
You are in the SS, dammit!
It is a purely honorary post.
Academics like to have around 
to give an air of sophistication.
Say I am a 
purely honorary Jew!
Why not say that 
to your comrades?
Holy God, you are amazing!
-It is difficult for me, you know? 
-Yes.
I can handle that 
prepare me every day ...
all the inhumanity, but this ...
this is very difficult 
to accept, understand?
Johnnie ...
I am ...
begging you now.
You have every right to ask.
Is not so rational!
No longer supports 
hear their rationalization!
Get me a 
move to Paris.
-Is not so simple. 
-Do you think it is simple for me?
The price you paid for.
Keep your money, Maurice.
Let me ... only a trace ...
of dignity, please.
You can put your ring back, 
if you want.
Hey, you ... John Halder!
Johnnie!
What are you doing here?
John Halder know? Our most 
important man of the university.
Typically it has so much humility.
Is in line with 
ordinary citizens.
But now he is exaggerating.
-Clear. 
-No problem, Freddie.
The captain will travel Halder 
for urgent matters of the Reich.
A shift to him. 
Where you want to go.
I will sign, 1a classe.
I do not mind to pay.
It is part of the elite. No need 
pay like everyone else. Where?
Paris, please.
How?
Can I buy a ticket 
to Paris? For tomorrow.
I need to see 
documentation of removal.
Have you seen the order of travel. 
Should be enough.
Like I said, 
a one-way ticket to Paris.
Do not want to return?
-No. Yes 
-You got me!
It is another thing that I love this guy, 
his sense of humor.
Yes, round trip. A passage from 
round trip to Paris, please.
Can I pay in cash.
Jokes about leaving the Reich?
Johnnie is not an intelligent act.
No, I meant Brandenburg.
And return to Brandenburg, 
please.
What is the reason for the trip?
My mother.
Mother?
Ms. Troller?
Mom, I'm me, John.
How long is that?
Where is Ms. Troller?
De-vacation. 
-Vacation!
By God, mother, 
Why do not you speak?
Hell!
You do not want me anymore.
Do not say that.
Ready.
Let me again 
live with you and Helen.
I am not more with Helen.
When did that happen?
Six months ago, 
you know it.
No, no go.
You need to drink something.
You will put me in a asylum?
I will not put you in a asylum, promise.
You need to go to a doctor.
I just need 
of my tablets.
You must release me, 
whether I get to you.
I get a little water.
Drugs.
I replace the lamp in the kitchen.
Mother!
No, Mom, no!
No ... I will not let you ...
Maurice, please!
Please take it.
Sorry, I was ...
You suck, you know? 
You are really bad.
My mother tried to kill.
She okay?
Fortunately, I was there. 
It was my fault.
I left the pills 
to reach it.
If you were there, 
she did not want to kill.
Do not know what she has past. 
Lost Memory, dignity.
Lost ... everything. 
She can hardly breathe.
At least she's not Jewish.
All is well. Okay.
Lack a bit.
Take ... This is for you.
Thank you.
Where will you eat a good cheesecake 
with all the Jewish prisoners?
Unless you make a 
special grant to Epstein.
Sao unbearable there.
I go every day, 
money spent there ...
and not say 
"hello" ... "thank you" ... nothing.
Fucking Jews, huh?
Nobody is talking 
in arresting anyone.
Probably we'll know. 
When we were in Ypres.
In October of that year, the 16
Regiment was near Bávaro.
He should go and come back with orders.
You can have him 
any given task.
"Hey, you, anspeçada. 
Yes, you, bottle cap. Come here. "
And he may have done continence 
for you. Imagine that.
So that's it. 
Will not get a ticket?
I can not. I tried.
You will be fine. 
It is a veteran of war.
That does not help more.
-Listen ... 
-All right.
I'm Jewish, you Nazi. 
End of story.
I think my mother was not 
grateful that you did it.
I was not a very good nurse.
Rs times, I played 
mazurka all afternoon ...
only not to hear her scream.
I wonder why the submitted 
so now she is gone.
Said that?
What are you saying?
I did have until the end.
Why?
Because you're her son. 
Why is it asking too much to a child.
A husband, perhaps.
-Sorry. 
-No, I'm ... well.
No need to worry about me. 
I am giving lessons in piano.
Really?
Everybody wants to learn 
classical music again.
By learning to cook.
Yes, the children told me.
I do not know what to say, 
but they eat everything.
No, they said 
until that is good.
They also told me all about 
you ... Are proud of you.
I will disappoint.
No, not disappointed.
-Disappointed, yes. 
-No.
Maybe not always show ...
but they are proud 
than you have done.
All are.
Let's start with 
a general visit.
You may have an idea 
of our facilities.
Incidentally, I read his essay.
What do you think?
A great field 
of ethical issues.
The inspector seemed to be 
the medical field, but no.
His field is literature?
The Committee sought the Reich to the 
I read a book on the subject.
A work of fiction?
Yes, a romance.
By virtue of it, I was invited 
to write the test that you have read.
What led, in due time, 
to my current role.
Ie?
Not exactly an inspector. 
One more ... consultant.
A consultant?
A consultant in humanity, 
I think I can say.
You should ask: 
"What life is this?"
Is not it?
Lis and I finally 
did some tests.
Hardly need redecorating. 
Right, baby?
No ... Employment ... 
entitles à home.
-Where did you get that furniture? 
-I was here.
The poor left Mandelstam 
Rs haste and did not take much.
Come see the bathroom. It is more 
than our old apartment.
Health!
Please.
Exams?
Want to know the verdict?
And the verdict is ...
we can not have kids.
Oh, Freddie, I am so sorry.
I live in this charging HQ.
"When will you begin to procreate?
A couple Nordic perfect 
as you and Lis. "
Sao obsessed with 
the drug of procreation.
At the current juncture, 
I will not go to major.
It is why we want children, 
but that does not facilitate things.
No.
I went to the doctor to the uncle's Lis 
the case of my trace file.
Maybe the doctor has been wrong.
Do not sleep for weeks.
I am awake all night, 
Imagine the crazy things.
Well .. we imagine things.
Me, is the music.
I can sit 
talking with someone ...
Excuse me.
Heil Hitler. Urgent Announcement 
for the major Drobisch.
Freddie.
Must attend to HQ 
immediately, sir.
If you were desperate 
for his wife have a son ...
you would use to someone, 
as a boy?
What? What happened?
The Jews threw in Vom Rath.
Who the hell is Vom Rath?
Third Secretary 
the embassy in Paris.
He got shot in the abdomen, 
devil.
He ruined my night.
Why?
Say, if Vom Rath died ...
I would not want to 
Jewish à be tomorrow night.
I better go apologize. 
Damn, not a duck for centuries!
Unfortunately, duty calls me.
I need to leave 
most of the charming host.
I only smell the duck. 
This is torture!
No peace for the wicked.
-All right if I leave here Lis? 
-Sure.
You have not said where are you, Freddie.
I have to burn some 
synagogues. You can take all night.
He said that thing 
with the Jews was over.
Yes, it was what I thought.
It will not burn synagogues, 
vai, baby?
No.
Orders are to organize 
a spontaneous demonstration ...
of popular indignation 
à for tomorrow night.
Bye.
He knows if caring, you know it.
But, poor Freddie, 
he has not slept.
Just give me that

Tell me, Beckermeier, you

Yes, sir.
So, I would like to continue 
his career in transport?
Say, digging roads?
A round-trip ticket 
going to Paris.

"Come à my house tomorrow."
No, no, no. Thank you.
Hallo.
Halder speaking.
Understood.
What?
-Vom Rath died. 
-Who?
Secretary of the Embassy in Paris.
-You know him? 
-What?
Received orders 
I report to work.
-Your post was not honorary? 
-Mobilizing the reservists.
I never saw you so.
I know. Forgive me. 
I do not know what to do.
I know what you think. 
And a man of letters ...
should not be 
patrolling the streets.
Never thought 
would come to this.
Of course not. But think ...
what exactly 
going to do tonight?
Keep the peace. Prevent 
to evacuate to control the mob.
-It is really only that? 
-Yeah.
You will not run any risk.
I'm not worried about me, 
I'm thinking about Maurice.
-I promised him that would be fine. 
-It is not your fault.
The Jews thought 
have been for years.
Accurate!
I should have helped him 
while it was time.
He can take care. 
He has no family.
You risk everything 
we have for him?
It is perhaps as 
I'm out.
John.
-If he comes, for this to him. 
-What did you do?
You need to do this for me.
You okay? Hurt you?
Look at you.
Look at you.
Anne!

Hold on!
Maurice!

Some Gluckstein Maurice?
Do not worry, 
none will escape the net.
I have orders to take him.

Is.
You can take them!
 The World </ i>
It  deep </ i>
E  deeper </ i>
 From the day </ i>
Anne!
He was here?
Who?
Maurice.
No ... No, come to bed.
APRIL 1942
There is a reference here à 
his friendship with Gluckstein.
Maurice Israel Gluckstein.
A particular relationship 
professional, was my doctor.
"Psychoanalyst," says here?
Yes
According to our data, 
continued to relate to him ...
after he was 
prohibited from clinic.
Continued?
That was in 1938.
He approached me, 
now I remember ...
to ask for my help 
to leave the country.
I led, 
is clear, authorities Rs.
Wrote about 
the question of the Jews?
My field is literature.
From a race.
We have reports on their lessons.
His work at university 
is appreciated by the leadership ...
but in time of war, we have 
to contribute a little more.
Bright.
We are busy with the program 
of resettlement in the east.
Resettlement ... of the Jews?
Among others. 
The vehicles are on their way.
We have to ensure that 
facilities work 100%.
We need reliable reports.
Whenever I start?
Immediately.
Anything else?
This ... resettlement ...
is obviously a 
colossal undertaking.
I was wondering, you can 
keep accurate records?
I am proud of it.
Mandei design a system 
special classification.
The more advanced. 
Everything is there.
Data cross.
It is impressive.
You can find anyone?
We can do a test?
Certainly.
Say, with the doctor 
you mentioned, Gluckstein.
Their records could 
to show where he was taken?
-We need a record check. 
-Yes, sir.
Gluckstein ... 
The full name is ...
Maurice Israel.
Year of birth?
1899.
Or something.
I would expect to see 
the result of our experiment ...
but imagine the paperwork 
that will stop at my desk.
-Good luck. 
-Dr.
Gluckstein, M. I.
Taken to Silesia.
Then when he says was caught?
Thank you.
You will not say goodbye?
I know what you did.
What are you talking about?
He came in-house that night. 
-Who?
You delivered.
How can you think that?
One thing that 
can tell the Gestapo ...
is that they maintain 
complete records.
Can follow.
John ... John, by 
please ... please.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Captain Halder?
I prefer "teacher".
This way, professor.
Thank you.
I think vai 
find everything in order.
Lieutenant-Colonel Eichmann 
be satisfied.
Actually, he asked me to 
do a little experiment ...
to see if their central 
the file is working 100%.
He wanted to see if you can 
locate a particular individual.
Must agree that it is 
a fascinating exercise.
The name, selected randomly, 
is "Gluckstein.
Maurice Gluckstein.
Our records show 
he should be here.
I regret having to disappoint you, 
teacher, but ...
we have here 
30thousand individuals.
And the turnover is considerable.
Moreover, each 
receives a number that comes ...
it is your 
only means of identification.
Then, simply find 
the number of Gluckstein?
In theory, yes.
But?
Let me put it as follows.
Certainly, central office 
everything seems in order, but here ...
You can find this man or not?
Frankly, 
Not a chance.
90% of them are 
eliminated to arrive.
None is here 
more than 1or 2months.
Understand.
Stop!
Move!
It is real.
A GOOD MAN
