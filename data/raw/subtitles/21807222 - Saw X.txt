That was a long one.
I don't suppose you can tell me
how it looks, can you?
Unfortunately,
I'm just the technician.
Your doctor will have
your results tomorrow.
- Would you like some help to...
- Thank you very much.
You're very kind.
I mean, yeah,
the cancer has brought
grief and pain
and fear into my every
waking moment.
Okay, Chris.
Today is a gift.
That's why they call it
the present.
Anyone else?
Henry Kessler.
Please.
Stage four pancreatic.
Terminal.
That's what they tell me,
anyway, but...
I'm gonna fight this
'til the end.
How much time do I have?
A year?
Months at best.
I still have a lot of work
that needs to be done.
My advice?
Retire.
You know, at this stage,
everyone always searches
for a way out.
But sometimes,
those who accept their fate,
have an easier time.
Easier time? What?
Dying?
So, your advice to me
is to die easy?
Help! Hey! Help! Help, please!
I'd like to play a game.
Perhaps one that addresses
those sticky fingers of yours.
I've had my eyes on you
and I do not like what I see.
Your job as a custodian
is a noble one.
Sanitizing and sterilizing
the hospital...
...helping patients
avoid sickness.
But there is
a sickness inside you
that needs to be excised.
You have the ability
to not only save
your soul today,
but your sight.
All you have to do is
click the dial
across the five positions
and you will live to see
another day.
You have 60 seconds.
Help, please!
Help me! Please, please,
please. Help. Help!
I can't! I can't, I can't!
Please, no!
Fuck you!
Good choice.
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.
Can I get
a blueberry scone, please?
Oh, they look good.
Thank you.
Henry.
We were in the same
cancer support group.
John Kramer.
I remember you.
Hey, good to see you.
And you as well.
You look marvelous.
Thank you. I... I...
I feel great.
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you were, uh...
Yeah, stage four pancreatic.
But now, four months later,
I'm in complete remission.
How?
It's a... it's a long story.
I'd love to hear it.
You got a minute to tell me?
Sure. Sure.
So, um,
I read about a doctor,
a specialist of sorts.
A Dr. Finn Pederson.
He offered a treatment
and it is a groundbreaking
drug cocktail
combined with surgery.
It's my war wound.
I know it looks bad,
but it was totally worth it.
Yeah.
- Is it available here?
- No.
No, no, the treatment's not
available in the States.
The, uh, the medication
isn't approved by the FDA.
Hell, it isn't approved
by anybody.
I, um... I haven't
seen them since...
since my treatment in Norway.
But...
this link...
is still good.
Hey, John,
good luck, man. Okay?
I'm... I'm rooting for you.
Thank you.
Take care.
Doctor, what exactly is
the procedure?
Well, under the right circumstances
and with the proper stimuli,
genes can be turned on and
turned off like a light switch.
And you're targeting
the cancer cells?
Exactly.
What we've managed to do is to create
a new cutting-edge drug cocktail,
along with surgery,
to teach the malignant cells
to switch off.
Fascinating.
Hmm.
My father, Dr. Finn Pederson,
was forced into hiding
by corrupt governments
and their relationship to big pharma.
Why?
Because my father was on the cusp
of curing dozens of diseases.
Which means no more need
for lifelong medication.
Can you imagine
what that implies?
Well, the big drug companies
certainly can.
And I'm here to say
that this just cannot stand.
So, while my father continues to make
further improvements to his formula,
I'm taking his treatment
on the road
for more trials,
to save as many lives
as humanly possible.
Who is this?
This is Cecilia Pederson.
Is this John Kramer?
Yes, it is.
Good.
We received the email
with your medical records, Mr. Kramer.
Thank you for reaching out.
I'm sifting through potential candidates
for our program.
So, I'm calling you now,
because we have spots opening
for treatment in about three months.
Mr. Kramer?
Uh, yes, I'm here.
You don't have three months,
do you?
Okay, listen...
I'm currently working in Mexico.
Oslo has become
too difficult for us.
But we have a team
of specialists here
who share our belief
in the Pederson method
and I've gathered
a group of eligible patients
to start treatment
a week from now.
I think I could add
one more spot.
If you're interested.
Yes, I'm interested.
Henry Kessler...
referred me to you.
Henry. He's doing well.
I'm so pleased.
I wonder if you could...
could you tell me a little more
about the treatment?
Of course.
It's a two-prong treatment that uses
my father's Xaxiophenol cocktail.
And in your case, it would be combined
with a cranial surgery to clear the tumor.
When both are used together,
the results have been stunning.
Over 90% success rate.
I know it's a long trip,
Mr. Kramer,
especially in your condition,
but I want you to know that we found
a very beautiful location
for our clinic
outside Mexico City.
It's in a
well-off-the-grid area,
in the countryside where you can
have safety and privacy.
We'll also, of course, arrange for
a trusted driver at your arrival.
What date did you have in mind?
The 5th, Friday after next.
I think I could make that.
- J. Kramer? Yeah?
- Si. Yes.
I'm Diego. Welcome to Mexico.
Allow me, sir. Please. This way.
There you go.
Take a look at that.
That's the Metropolitan Cathedral.
That's the revolutionary memorial.
That's the Angel
of Independence.
Take a look at that.
Isn't it beautiful?
Hey, J.
That, my friend, that's the old
Aztec statue of Tlaloc.
That's where the priests
chop the hearts
out of their subjects
and roll them down the stairs.
Every day, a tourist wants me
to take them here.
Very strange.
Hey, J.
You okay?
Get out!
What's your name?
John Kramer.
Lie to me again and I'll empty
this chamber in your eye.
I'm not lying.
My name is John Kramer.
Not to worry, senor
Kramer, you're fine.
You're safe. Come with me.
Come, come.
Here. Welcome. Watch your head.
Your room.
Here. Come.
It's here. Good luck.
Si?
I am John Kramer.
Come.
I... Gabriela.
Mi familia.
Come.
Sleep. Sleep here.
Dr. Cecilia Pederson?
Ah. Si.
She saved life. My life.
I get. I get now.
Mr. Kramer, welcome.
That was quite a reception
that I got on the way out here.
Oh, our welcome wagon?
I know, I'm sorry.
But we've had to beef up
the security wherever we go.
The big drug companies
are always one step behind
and so we must keep our location
secret from everyone, even you.
Come.
I want you to meet the team.
Yeah?
That's Carlos.
Our local football star.
His father is the caretaker.
This used to be
a chemical factory back in the day.
Mateo.
Hello, Doctor.
This is John Kramer.
Very nice to meet you, Mr. Kramer,
and welcome to our clinic.
You're in very good hands
with us.
Hmm.
Mateo is an anesthesiologist
at Hospital Alto Prado.
He did his residency at Johns Hopkins
and has worked a lot with my father.
- Yes.
- He'll be helping out
with your surgery tomorrow.
Thank you.
- I'll be right here if you need anything.
- Thank you.
This is Valentina,
one of our nurses.
She'll be taking some scans
and drawing some blood,
all in preparation for the
injection therapy later today.
Mr. Sears' vitals look good.
He's cleared for release.
Wonderful.
Parker Sears, John Kramer.
Thyroid cancer, advanced. You?
Uh, brain.
Ah. You win.
Sorry, they cut me open yesterday.
Took out a tumor
the size of my knob.
I'm just about to start
the cocktail.
Mutated natural killer cells.
They're a type of
cytotoxic lymphocyte.
Developed by my father.
Good luck, John.
Thank you.
So, we've arranged
for you to stay at a hotel.
Shall we begin?
Please, don't move.
So, Mr. Kramer...
- What do you do? Like, for a living?
- John.
Please, call me John.
And what do you do, John?
I've been a civil engineer and
an architect most of my life.
Now, I...
have a few hobbies.
Hmm.
Let me guess.
Classic car renovation.
- No?
- No.
I, uh...
I help people overcome
inner obstacles.
Help them make positive
changes in their lives.
Like a life coach, yeah?
Something like that.
Sounds nice.
I can't think of anything more
important than helping others.
Yeah.
Tequila.
For good luck.
Thank you, Gabriela.
De nada.
It's a local favorite.
You can't drink it now, though.
Not before surgery.
"My sun sets to rise again."
Your sun is rising again, John.
We will make sure of it.
You speak English, Carlos?
Que?
That's about
as good as my Spanish.
How do you say "pull"?
Pull, pull. Pull.
Jalar.
Jalar.
Excellent. Jalar.
Gracias.
And who performs the surgery?
Dr. Ramone Cortez.
Also at Alto Prado.
He's the best neurosurgeon
in 2,000 miles.
He's the doctor I'd use
if my own family was on the table.
Now, we'll be performing
an "awake craniotomy."
This means that you'll be floating in
and out of consciousness...
...so that we can do
function mapping...
This allows us to monitor
your abilities,
so that we don't touch
any part of your brain
that might affect speech
or movement...
Mr. Kramer...
Can you please wiggle
your fingers?
Good. Motor function is clear.
Suction vac, please.
Valentina,
will you move...
Right, right, right.
Okay, great.
We're gonna put you back to sleep.
I'm gonna count down from ten.
Ten...
nine, eight...
seven, six...
Hi, there.
You did great.
Where are we?
We're two blocks away
from Mateo's hospital.
In case you need a transfusion.
I got your bloodwork.
Hemoglobin's normal.
It all looks good, John.
It all looks good.
Now...
Drink two a day.
One in the morning
and one at night.
Okay.
In addition
to my father's treatment,
it contains a painkiller you'll need
for the next seven days.
And after that,
what happens then?
Your whole life happens then.
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Gabriela.
Or, any of the others.
I'll send them your best.
Don't get your head wet.
The bandage is anti-bacterial.
It will stave off infection.
Valentina will swing by
to keep an eye on it for you.
Get some rest now, John.
Okay.
Dr. Pederson,
just so you know...
I'll wire the second half
of the payment tomorrow morning.
Thank you, John.
Have a good life, John.
A long, good life.
Do you have a gift card?
It's for a friend. Thank you.
Un momento, por favor.
Hello?
Gabriela?
Hello, and welcome
to section five
in our neurosurgery series.
The human brain is a mystery,
hundreds of millions...
We'll be performing
an "awake craniotomy."
This means that you'll be floating in
and out of consciousness.
Valentina...
Right, right, right.
Have a good life, John.
A long, good life.
Hey, guys.
Did you know that when the Aztecs roll the heart
of their victim down the stairs
people will take them home
and display them like ornaments?
In their fucking houses.
Yeah.
- Nice.
- Yes, sir, welcome to Mexico.
Okay, so here we are.
This is the Tlaloc statue.
Okay?
Huh. Thank you, man.
Have a good one.
Of course, man. Thanks.
Hello.
Buenas noches.
Ayuda!
Ayuda!
Kramer?
Hey, man.
I've told you
what you wanted to know!
I fucking told you
who you're looking for!
Kramer. Kramer!
Hello, Diego. Or, should I call you...
Dr. Cortez?
I'd like to play a game.
Attached to your arms
are two explosive devices.
Pipe bombs.
Think of the explosives
as a sort of cancer.
A malignancy that must be
cut out for you to survive.
The blades cannot cut through
the galvanized cable.
But they can slice through
flesh and muscle,
allowing you to cut
the cancer away.
Live, or die.
The choice is yours.
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Kramer.
Kramer!
You're gonna be okay.
Detective...
I could use your assistance...
in locating some people that are
in need of our services.
Okay. Vamonos.
Mateo?
Hey.
Mm.
Gracias.
I'm arranging a small team
in Bolivia next week, Margaret.
Yeah, we have three cases
scheduled already.
But I think that we might
have room for one more spot.
Yeah. We're working
off the grid, of course,
but if you think
you can get there, Margaret.
No... Please,
no need to cry, Margaret.
No...
I'm not an angel.
It's pure science.
All right.
You send those medical records
in and we'll have a look, all right?
Perfect.
See you soon, Margaret.
See you soon.
I've got a gun!
What the fuck...
Hi.
Who are you?
This is my associate, Amanda.
Get some rest, Cecilia.
You're going to
fucking need it.
Mateo.
What the fuck
is going on?
Why are we back here?
Oh, my God. What the...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Help. Who are you?
- Do you know why we're here?
- Hey! Hey.
Lady, do you know...
Do you know who
brought us here?
Hey! Can you help us?
Who are you?
Please. Please, please.
Hey, hey...
What... What are you doing?
Hey.
John?
It was you?
Why?
Why are we here?
John!
What is this?
We were only trying
to help you.
That game is over.
And a new game is
about to begin.
Valentina...
...did my blood ever
make it to the lab?
Or...
did you just suck it out and flush it down
the drain somewhere?
Mr. Kramer. Mr. Kramer.
Please, listen to me.
I beg you.
I beg you, please. Please.
We have nothing
to do with this.
We didn't know what was
going on. It was all her.
She planned the whole thing.
Mateo, I don't even know
if that's your real name.
- It is my real name.
- It is, oh.
'Cause they have never heard
of you at the hospital.
She told me to say that
I worked there.
- But I don't. I'm sorry.
- Mm, mm.
- Please wait. Let me explain.
- Mr. Kramer...
I meant no harm.
I would really like
to believe you, Gabriela.
You'll have a chance
to prove yourself.
Por favor. Por favor.
The key to your freedom
is inside that box.
What the hell is that?
It's a Gigli saw.
I thought you said
there was a key?
He was speaking metaphorically.
He does that a lot.
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill both of you
motherfuckers!
That's a good plan.
You're gonna wanna
really listen carefully
to the rules
in order to pull that off.
Fuck you!
Go ahead.
No. No.
What...
No. No. What?
The wire saw inside of that box
was invented
by an Italian physician.
Leonardo Gigli.
It creates an extraordinarily
clean-cut to the bone.
No.
No. No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
The dotted line on your leg
marks the spot.
Are you fucking crazy?
What makes you think
I'd fucking cut off my own leg?
Because if you don't,
the wire saw that's wrapped
around your neck
will first cut into your skin,
then your vertebral ligaments,
and finally, it'll sever
your spinal cord.
No.
The CliffsNotes version?
It's gonna
cut your head off.
No!
You won't.
You wouldn't.
Uh, it's true.
We won't.
But Valentina might.
All of you...
All of you...
All of you...
You promised dying people.
Dying people!
That you could save their lives.
And in doing so, you took
advantage of the only thing...
that they still possessed.
Hope.
No, John. We've worked
to heal people.
Your case was... different.
And still you lie.
My associate, Amanda here,
has had a look at your bank records.
Take a look.
Who are those 34 people to you?
John's case
was different?
Did you heal
any of those 34 people?
Did they have children
that are now orphaned?
You've been doing this
larcenist dance now
for more than eight years.
Eight years.
That's more than $8 million.
That's a lot of pain...
to inflict on others
for your own enrichment.
There was no healing
going on there, bitch.
They're all underground.
I checked.
We know everything.
We have everything.
Including the cash
from your house.
We have it upstairs.
Please. Please,
don't do this. Please.
Please, help me.
Please.
That's exactly
what we are doing, Valentina.
This is not retribution,
it's a reawakening.
Valentina, follow my instructions
if you want to live.
There are more than five pounds
of marrow in the human body.
All you need is three ounces.
There's more than enough in your femur.
Just suction it out,
it'll be transferred
to that device right there
and it will deactivate the saw
around your neck.
Don't hesitate.
Because your time is prescribed.
No. No.
Now,
refusing to play the game
is not an option.
If you refuse...
you will remain in this room...
Forever.
You'll make it.
So long as you keep your head.
We were not involved
in the whole thing.
- Please.
- John! Please.
This is not right.
Not right?
A lecture in moral decency?
From you?
No, no, John. John!
Please, wait, John!
John!
John!
Please, please, please, help me.
John, please wait!
Please wait! Please wait!
What do we do?
John!
John, please wait!
You don't have to do this! John! John!
No, no.
Valentina, look at me.
Look at me!
You can do this.
No, no, no, I can't! No.
You have to do this!
No!
Valentina,
come on! Do it!
Okay.
You can do it.
Oh, my God! No!
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!
Oh, my God.
- The tourniquet.
- No, no!
Put it on.
Goddamn it! Valentina.
The tourniquet, put it on!
Faster!
You can do this.
You can do this!
Now, the wire saw.
Wrap it under your leg.
If Diego could do this,
you can do this.
Okay.
Come on.
You have to. Save yourself!
Oh, my God!
I can't! I can't!
Don't stop, don't think!
Just do it!
No!
Come on!
Faster.
Do it, don't think. Keep going.
You're gonna die. Come on!
You're running
out of time!
Come on.
Fuck. Come on!
Faster.
Come on. Faster!
Keep going until it's off!
No!
For God's sake, Valentina,
save yourself!
Go on.
Okay, okay, okay.
You're running out of time!
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!
You're doing great.
You're doing great.
Please.
I'm not gonna make it.
No, no, no! I'm no
going to make it!
Oh, my God. No. No. No.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
No. No, no, no!
No!
No!
Oh, fuck.
Help!
Help!
This is all
your fault.
You brought me into this.
You brought me into this!
Get it together, Gabby!
Oh, no...
I'm not the one addicted
to Oxy, am I?
Gabriela's next.
What?
Sometimes we get
sucked into things that
are against our nature.
Drugs are as vicious
as they are powerful.
We all have free will.
Gabriela had her own free will.
And if you can't handle this,
how will you handle the rest of our work?
- They're not looking.
- Why don't we use the...
- Our clothes to tie them and take it...
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes, yes, we can do that.
- We need a rope.
Do you want to keep going?
Yes.
The pain...
just comes in waves.
Listen, I'm not ready
to do this without you.
You are ready.
You are ready and you can.
Cecilia. Cecilia,
what are you doing?
Cecilia,
don't touch her!
- Shh.
- Cecilia, don't touch her.
Stop.
No, no.
Right now, Amanda, these people
deserve to be tested.
That lady doctor
deserves nothing.
Everyone deserves a chance.
An opportunity
to redeem themselves.
You should know that
more than anyone.
Hmm.
Cecilia.
Cecilia, what the fuck is that?
Cecilia, what are you doing?
No... No. No. Wait!
- No! No!
- Shh.
Ugh.
We have a rope.
- No!
- Mateo!
Fine, fine.
Okay. Yes, you can loop it
around the table and...
And pull it in.
Yes, yes.
- Pick up, pick up.
- Yeah.
No!
No! No, no!
Listen. Just listen.
You're right.
I'm a total fraud.
But my father, John,
he's the real deal.
And you know that.
He can save you.
Is that your concern?
Saving me?
But he can heal you.
I swear to God.
That's who I was
trying to call.
Let me talk to him.
Let me tell him where we are
and he will come.
He will come help you.
To save my life.
Begging won't help. Trust me,
you're not the first to try.
Please.
Please, please.
Please help. Please.
Please, please.
John, we have a visitor.
Open this fucking door!
It's Parker Sears!
I've come to get my money back
and I'm not going until I get it!
- Help! Hey!
- Pederson, you thief!
Oh, fuck.
Hey.
Hey! What is this?
Walk in with a gun,
get treated like a criminal.
Who are you?
I was gonna ask you
the same question.
I know you. Kramer.
Brain cancer, right?
What are you
doing here, Parker?
I came to get my money back.
These people are just crooks.
Look at this.
Ah.
Hmm...
Yeah.
Is that Pederson?
And Mateo.
Gabriela, Valentina,
and Diego was in on it too.
They're all con artists.
And we, we were the suckers.
That bitch.
I gave her everything.
All the money I had.
That was for my family,
that money.
To make good with my kids
when I was gone.
But instead,
you traded it for magic beans.
More time, a shot at life.
What's your life
really mean to you, Parker?
Have you ever thought
about that?
Because if you find
the meaning of your life,
what you've found is your soul.
We have your money.
You can be assured of that.
But before I let you
confront Cecilia,
there's a game that she has to
play out to its conclusion.
What do you mean a game?
Oh, God...
You killed Valentina.
We don't kill.
You chopped her
fucking head off!
Valentina died
because she didn't have the will to live.
She failed her test.
John, if he found us here,
others might too, and soon.
We're wasting time.
I'm just trying
to give Mr. Sears
a chance to make his choice.
What choice?
I don't have a choice. What are
you two fucking talking about?
I'm going to give you
an opportunity
to do something significant
with your life.
Right now.
I'm listening.
But first, I'm going to
have to insist...
no guns.
Rules are rules.
Consequences for
breaking them will be dire.
Understood?
Undo me now?
John.
I promise you, Amanda.
One way or another,
it's all gonna work out according to plan.
Why don't you go and prepare
Gabriela for the next game?
- You want me to do it?
- No.
But the anesthesiologist
is next.
Lady, can you
talk to me, please?
Can you... Can you
please talk to me?
Please talk to me.
You fucking bitch!
You fucking cunt!
Help me, help me.
Help me. Please.
Believe it or not, I just did.
- You were next.
- He's a monster.
He's gonna kill you the same way
he's gonna kill all of us. Please...
You don't know John.
If you want any more of my help,
keep your mouth shut about that.
Is that so I don't shoot that
thief in the face?
Trust me, Mr. Sears.
In short order,
she'll wish that you had.
Mateo.
Fuck.
What...
Ah...
What the fuck is that?
What is it? What is it?
I don't know what the fuck
all of these things are.
Medical supplies, I think.
And there's
a fucking bone cutter.
A craniotome.
I don't care what the fucking
thing is called, Cecilia!
There's this thing
that says "Play me."
I'm not gonna touch that thing.
Fine. Fine.
Hello, Mateo.
It's time to play a game.
The rules are simple.
Place a big enough piece
of your cerebral tissue
into the glass enzyme tank
and you win.
A piece of what?
- A piece of what?
- Gray matter.
What does that mean?
A piece of your brain.
- This is insane.
- Kramer!
John, please!
Kramer!
Please!
If you complete your task
in less than three minutes,
the enzymes will dissolve
the tissue to close a circuit.
This will save your life.
But know this.
The brain is a remarkably
resilient organ.
There have been accounts
of people undergoing
complete anatomical hemispherectomies.
Half their brain removed,
only to have it rewire itself,
so that the patient
not only survives, but thrives.
Ah...
I don't know how to do this.
I don't know how to do that.
Okay...
The only thing
I have not provided is your anesthetic.
But trust me,
you will want to remain alert.
And if you fail to act,
the consequences
will not go well for you.
Do not waste time.
Live or die,
the choice is yours.
No, no, no.
I need to take this thing off.
- Somebody help me.
- Mateo.
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?
You have to use the craniotome.
Yes, Mateo, you have to.
That is not going to
fucking happen.
You have to cut into your scalp.
- No. No.
- Yes!
I can't do it.
I can't...
Do you want to live?
Or wind up like her?
- Mateo!
- Okay.
Is there a cable?
Is this it?
This is it.
Yes.
Just do it.
Faster!
Oh, my God. Oh... Oh, my God.
Pull it out!
Ah!
Dig it out! Do it!
Oh...
No!
No!
No! Mateo!
You guys are fucking sick.
We're sick?
These people kill
with false hope.
What if there is something
her father can do to help you?
Amanda, you know
as well as I do...
people will say almost anything
to save their own life.
Yeah, but her father's real.
We both know that.
Amanda, the reality is...
I'm dying.
I am dying.
You have to face that.
But our work's not gonna end.
And I'm trust... trusting you...
to carry on.
It's almost morning.
We have a job to do.
We're running out of time.
I want you to go
and free Mr. Sears.
And see if he'll play
by the rules.
No.
Gabriela, you have to take it.
No.
We'll never get
out of here otherwise.
What was that?
What's that?
Hello, Gabriela.
I want to play a game...
No, no, stop it!
Stop it. Stop it...
I'm afraid that's not
going to work.
You are going to
have to play the game.
No! No, no, no, no, no!
What the fuck?
Although
you all pretended
to cure my cancer,
I have spent years in treatment.
Chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, radiation.
Radiation machines
are not to be trifled with.
So, follow my instructions
carefully, Gabriela.
Fuck.
The only way out is to free your hand
and ankle from the shackles.
Use the tool above you.
No! No, you can't!
You can't! Let me out!
Let me out!
Broken bones heal.
Flesh can be grafted.
This will not be easy,
but then,
nothing worth having,
like life, ever is.
You have to take it, Gabby.
Do it.
You have to do it, Gabby.
No, no, no, no, no!
Start with your foot.
You'll swing out of the way.
Okay, Gabby.
You did it, Gabby.
No.
No. No.
No. No, no. No.
Stop it. Please.
Don't stop. Gabby!
Drop her at a hospital.
Okay, play time's over.
Give me the keys.
I stated to you very clearly,
that guns were
against the rules.
Fuck your rules, John.
The keys to Cecilia's chains.
You don't need the keys.
She's not going anywhere.
Now, move.
Come on. Move.
I thought
you forgot about me.
Not a chance.
You know I'd die for you, baby.
Unlock her.
Now!
I've been wanting to do that
since the moment I met you.
Come on, old man.
Lock yourself in.
Come on, move!
New game.
It's called we live,
you die, fuck you.
Simple enough?
I told you
Parker would break the rules.
You failed your test, asshole.
We need to get her
to a hospital.
She won her game
and she deserves to live.
Oh, does she now?
Her injuries need
medical treatment.
Do they?
Don't even think about it!
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!
You sick bitch!
Unfortunately, I don't think
she's gonna make it.
Parker.
Give me the keys.
Lock yourself in.
So, tell me, John.
You've been doing this for a
very long time, haven't you?
How did I stop you?
Am I just that good?
Don't flatter yourself.
I just had a lapse in judgement.
- That's all.
- Yeah, I agree.
For a guy as smart
as you are, John,
you kind of overplayed your hand here,
wouldn't you say?
You don't give a shit
that all your friends are dead
because of you?
Friends?
Not friends.
They were loose ends, sweetheart.
Nothing but loose ends.
Do you want to know what I thought
when I watched them each die?
One less person
to split the money with.
So, thank you.
You did me a favor.
You're gonna have to get
the money back from me,
before you two can split it.
I think
we'll get the money back.
It's upstairs.
You know she's eventually
gonna kill you, too, right?
Fuck off, Amanda.
Amanda's right.
She's gonna burn you.
You just can't see it yet.
God...
Is that really
all you've got left, John?
When I realized
who you really were...
Jig-fucking-saw...
I got a bit worried.
God's honest.
And now, the great John Kramer
is gonna die
in one of his own traps.
There's some wicked irony.
And the crazy thing is,
that you could have just walked away.
Acknowledged that you
got beat, got conned.
But, no...
You just had to come back,
didn't you?
Why don't we put this bitch
on the other side of that thing
and press play?
You know, this fucking asshole
is dead in two months,
but I want him to suffer
like he made me suffer.
I want his last memory to be
watching someone innocent die.
If you think I'm innocent...
You?
Not for a second.
But I think I hear an answer.
- Hey, Carlos.
- Hi.
What are you doing?
I've got some friends
I want you to meet.
- Wanna come inside?
- Okay.
Come on.
Here we are.
Look who I found.
John...
Who is that?
A friend.
And a terrible,
unforeseen consequence.
Please, don't do this.
- The boy is innocent.
- Exactly.
So, if you let him die,
it's all on you.
How do we get
this thing started?
It's activated by the subject.
Of course.
Because you wouldn't be
responsible for killing anyone, would you?
Fucking hypocrite.
Well, you might want to tell
the kid the rules before we start.
He's not a player.
In any of this.
Oh, come on, John.
Do the scary voice.
"I'd like to play a game."
No?
You really want the boy to play
without hearing the rules?
I don't think
he's gonna fare well.
John, I will cut his throat!
This is not right.
- It's not right.
- Oh, really?
A lecture on moral decency
from you?
You've got ten seconds,
or I hit the lever myself.
And I don't have a silly
moral code like you, trust me.
Carlos...
Comprende?
Turn it on,
Parker, and let's go.
No jalar.
No, no!
No.
Not waterboarding, huh?
Blood-boarding.
No jalar, Carlos! No jalar!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it, you're killing him!
All he has to do is
push the lever,
sacrifice the kid.
Let's go and get the money.
Once I heard your voice over that speaker,
I knew I'd be fine.
I can't believe they fell for the whole damn thing,
hook, line, and sinker.
- I know.
- Fucking idiots.
But if you were the last player,
who was supposed to be on the other side
of that plank with you?
There's the money.
Where's the fucking money?
Where's the money?
Fuck!
Fuck.
You are a warrior, my boy.
A warrior.
Are you okay?
Not exactly
as we planned it, but...
How did they know?
How did they know about you?
Parker Sears!
Okay? He was in on it!
He's a handler
and he's fucking Cecilia, too!
I was able
to find the man you asked for.
Uh-huh. Good.
But Parker Sears?
You'll have to find
another way.
Gotcha.
We have a visitor.
Cecilia Pederson,
Parker Sears,
you've each been
working a grift.
Playing a role,
working together
continuing to play out
your scam.
Never realizing that you have been
the marks all night long.
You were given a chance
for redemption,
but at every turn,
you chose death,
instead of life.
I promise you,
one way or another,
it's all gonna work out
according to plan.
You have played
your last con game...
- No!
- ...but not your last game.
The two of you have worked together
to destroy others.
Now, you will work
against each other.
Only one can survive.
And the choice is yours.
I thought you forgot about me.
You know I'd die for you, baby.
Ah!
You know she's eventually
gonna kill you, too, right?
- Fuck off, Amanda.
- She's gonna burn you.
You just can't see it yet.
John!
John!
Gracias.
Let's get you home, Carlos.
It's my war wound.
Where is your scar...
Henry?
Thank you, Detective,
for locating
my fellow cancer patient.
Out of all the men to cheat,
you picked John Kramer?
I mean...
I call that epic bad luck.
Please...
John, please.
Please, don't kill me.
That's the last thing that
you should be worried about.
Now...
I want to play a game.
No! No!
No! No!
