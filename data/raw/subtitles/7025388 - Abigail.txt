- [Jonathan] Ah!
- [young Abigail screams]
[Jonathan]
I've got you, my girl!
I've got you, got you, got you!
- Got you, got you, got you.
- [young Abigail laughs]
Navigator, which way is home?
What?
- Have we gotten lost?
- Lost?
No! No, no, no.
That... That's not like us.
You keep your head up.
Up, up.
Higher. Now...
You see that kite? Up there.
[Jonathan]
See the end of that string?
That's the North Star.
And that's because it tells us
where the North Pole is.
Now...
Uh... Ah!
Now we know that north...
- [scrapes]
- is there.
And we live...
right down here.
In the south.
So...
[scrapes]
Ta-da!
We've found our way home.
Whenever you're lost...
you just keep your chin... up.
Now...
Let's go home.
[Jonathan] Mom has baked a pie.
And it's tasty, I bet.

[young Abigail] Mr. Garrett!
[Mr. Garret] Abigail!
What's this?
[young Abigail] What?
[giggles]
William!
What brings the head
of the Security Department here?
Yes, that was the order
for your entire department.
Good evening, Mr. Garrett.
What is all this fuss about?
You know what I did
for this city.
How important
I am to them, William.
I will tell you
what will happen.
I will come out of there,
and no one will be able
to lay a hand on me.
[young Abigail] Daddy?
Is Mr. Garrett staying for tea?
Yes, my darling.
I'm sure Mr. Garrett
would love to have some tea.
But it's bedtime.
You give me half an hour
to put her to bed.
[papers rustling]
[door squeaks]
Shh...
[metal clanking softly]
[door creaks]
- Dad.
- Shh.
[Jonathan] Look what I have.
It's a gift.
I made it specially for you.
It's so pretty.
So round.
Now this sphere
contains all my thoughts
about you.
You keep it
with you always. Deal?
Deal.
Thanks, Daddy.
Now, you go to sleep, princess.
And close your eyes,
and I'll sit with you
until you fall asleep.
Come on.
[light clicks]
[distant blasts]
[blasting continues]
[Margaret] He can't be sick!
You didn't even scan him!
Your husband is infected.
He and everyone else
at the lab. I'm sorry, Margaret.
[woman 1] Wait.
- [Margaret] William! William!
- Wait, no. No, no, please.
Roy!
You didn't scan him!

[Head of Security Dept.]
This is the head
of the Security Department
speaking.
For some time now,
the boundary has given us peace and quiet.
But the epidemic
has broken out once again.
"Henry's been taken hostage
by lan's gang."
"We meet at nine
on the abandoned street."
[carriage rattling]
[somber music]
[Head of Security Dept.] The
number of infected people
is growing every hour.
We all need to unite
and work together
to deal with this crisis.
The inspectors
of the Security Department
are working
harder than ever,
tirelessly
conducting checks
in order to catch all the
infections at an early stage.
This disease
is highly contagious,
and leads anyone infected
to an excruciating death.
We are doing everything
in our power
to stop it from spreading
across our city.
There are no recognizable
symptoms at the onset.
And this infection can only be
detected by a special device.
In stage two of
the infection,
the victim will experience
fever and disease.
[barks]
In stage three, convulsions
and hallucinations.
During the third stage,
the victim becomes
highly contagious.
For the sake of
public safety,
all infected persons
are quarantined,
and a painless, lethal
injection is administered
before the disease progresses
to stage three.
Anyone sheltering
infected persons
will be considered a traitor
and will be charged with treason
for having put
public safety at risk.
Hi, Dad.
[grim music]
[Head of Security Dept.]
The curfew has begun.
You are requested
to return to your homes.
He is our hostage.
He was on our territory
where you're not allowed to go.
They'll scan you.
And I bet at least one of you
turn out to be infected.
Just like your relatives.
They'll take you in,
and give you the injection.
Get out of here
while we are still being nice.
- [angry shouts]
- [man 1] Get out of here!
[angry shouts]
- We don't need you...
- Are you really that stupid?
If you start a war here now,
the inspectors will come
in no time.
Shut your mouth,
you child of a leper.
The first one who finds
the flare
gets to the roof
and lights it, wins.
If I win, you will let him go.
And you, lan, will ask him
for his forgiveness.
On your knees.
And, uh, what if I win?
Hmm...
Then I'll be your hostage
instead of him.
Well, get ready.
You're not going home
for a long time.
[thuds]
[man 2] Go. You got this, lan!
- [man 3] Come on!
- [woman 1] Get up!
[suspenseful music]
[suspenseful music continues]
- Come on, lan! Come on!
- [cheering]
[woman 2]
Guys, get out of there.
- [man 4] Inspectors!
- [woman 2] What?
- Come on!
- [panicked shouts]
- [woman 2] Hurry! Hurry!
- [man 5] Come on!
- [panicked shouts]
- [man 5] No!
[panicked shouts]
- [blast]
- [Ian] Inspectors!

Infection. First stage.
Take him.
No, no, no, no!
- [Ian] It's a mistake!
- [inspector 1] Let's go.
[Ian] I'm not infected!
Uncle... Roy?
[metal clanks]
[suspenseful music]
[clock ticking]
[Jonathan] Roy, stop.
Garret's orders.
I don't know what he's thinking.
But I've been called
to the residence.
I'll come by later.
Roy, try not to worry.
I'm sure everything
will work itself out.
[young Abigail] Daddy...
how did I get here?
Oh, um... Well...
Shall we... investigate that?
Hmm... Now, can you
tell me, missy,
what do you recall? Hmm?
I came to sit with you...
Mmm, yes. You came to sit,
and then you fell asleep.
Ah!
That's it.
You fell asleep,
and then you forgot. Hmm?
Dad, what is that thing?
Oh! That is, uh...
That is so
that you don't forget.
[clanks]
Dad.
Why do you have so many clocks?
Well, it's so that I...
I don't lose track of time.
You see because these clocks...
they keep time safe.
For you and me.
Can you really lose it?
Hey...
you'll be sitting here
and you'll be listening
to the tick, tick, tick,
tock, tock, tock...
of all these clocks.
And before you know it...
[soft bang]
It's gone.
[Margaret]
Happy Boundary Day, my dear!
It's a big holiday.
It's not a holiday, Mom.
I'll bake a cake.
Go get me some flour.
[Abigail]
I'm not going outside today.
[Margaret]
What is this, my daughter?
Today everyone
has to go to the square.
I'm not in the mood.
I would go myself,
but I have to sit here
at the sewing machine
until nighttime.
All right.
[Margaret] Hey! Excuse me!
Could you please
buy us some flour?
Mom! What are you doing?
[Margaret] No? Okay. Fine.
- Mom, please.
- Excuse me.
You see, my daughter Abigail
is not in the mood today.
Mom, okay. I'll go. I'll go.
Get me some sugar too.
[bell tolls]
[indistinct chatter]
[tense music]
[suspenseful music]
Infection check! Stop!
I will take this one myself.
[suspenseful music]
Oh!
[suspenseful music continues]
[glass shatters]
[pants heavily]
[clatters]
[metal clanks]
[Margaret] I hit an inspector.
That's it!
We're finished!
They'll never forgive us.
We need to run away.
Mom, please stop!
There is no place to run.
We can't leave the city.
Listen. Roy is Dad's friend.
They were taken away together,
but now Roy is an inspector.
So maybe Dad is also alive.
Your father is dead.
He was infected.
But Roy was too!
And if he was sick,
then he should be dead
for ten years already!
Abby, stop! Pack your things!
If we don't hide,
they'll arrest us.
Mom. Please. Mom.
Please.
Roy won't tell on us.
How do you know that?
Otherwise, I'll tell everyone
that he was visiting his wife.
And that they have a child
that she keeps hidden at home.
Why does she hide him?
And why do the inspectors
wear masks?
The authorities don't want us
to know
that some of them
are very close to us.
We're going to interrogate Roy.
He will help us find Dad.
What? No, Abby.
Yes. What else
do we have to lose?
Why live a life
where we're stigmatized
as the family
of an infected one.
This way, we can at least hope
to find Dad.
[Abigail] Where is my father?
I'm going to report
on both of you
to the Security Department.
- This will be the end of you.
- [knocking on door]
- They'll take you both in.
- Go ahead.
I've already told somebody
about you.
Roy? Are you okay? Oh!
Yeah.
Now I see.
And all the neighbors have been
wondering who the father was.
He's not supposed
to see his family,
but he can come back to us.
You have to understand
how much that means to me.
[Mayor] Today,
we celebrate
the 105th anniversary
of the city boundary.
We offer our most
honorable respect
for the founders of Fencington.
Our wise leaders and visionaries
of world peace and public order.
They put an end to the threat
of mass infection.
Our enemies on the other side
are using biological weapons
in the war against us.
If it hadn't been
for our founding fathers
our city would have become
an infected zone.
[Roy] What do you want?
You'll do as I say,
or I'll turn you in.
And your son will grow up
without a father.
Leave my family
out of this, Abby.
I will, if you do what I say.
[man over PA system]
The day after...
Why the long face, darling?
Smile.
People are watching us.
[man over PA system] every
house, door by door.
Checking every single
building in the city.
I ask you to offer them
whatever assistance you can.
They work for the benefit
of us all.
Anyone sheltering
infected persons
will be considered
a traitor
and will be charged
with treason for having put
public safety at risk.
Where's my father?
I don't know, Abby.
[Roy] When they got us in,
we got immediately separated.
I was offered a choice...
either deportation,
or become an inspector.
And you chose to wear the mask.
[grim music]
[grim music continues]
What's this?
Is that the tunnel that leads
to the residence
of the Security Department?
[Roy] Yes.
And do you know
where they keep the information
about the infected ones?
[Roy]Ethan Blake should know
where your father is.
[Abigail] Ethan Blake.
He worked with Dad.
[Roy] He is responsible
for the infected ones.
- Does he still live there?
- Yes.
I'll go there and see by myself.
Nobody is allowed to leave
the square during the ceremony.
You'll see to it
that I'll be able to leave.
[light footsteps]
[gasps]
Where are the headquarters?
Answer me.
Answer me!
[thwacks]
You're going to tell me
everything!
[thuds]
Where are the headquarters?
[Garrett]
Where are the headquarters?
[clatters]

[drawer clanks]
Ian...
Deportation...
[car engine rumbles]

[car door slams]

Please add to the list
Ethan Blake.
In half an hour.
Deporting the infected
to the permanent detention zone.

Extra security.
I have no information
about this.
What do you care?
I'm the chief engineer,
Ethan Blake.
[Ethan] I told you.
Open up!
Now!

Dad, what's past the border?
Shh...
We mustn't talk about that.
Uh... Well, should I tell you
a story instead?
[young Abigail] Deal.
Deal.
[Jonathan] Once upon a time,
in a city far, far away,
the people were very good
friends with the strangers.
What are strangers like?
Well, they're like people, but,
well, they're just not the same
as everyone else.
Their eyes glow bright,
in different colors.
The king of the city,
he didn't like this.
And he was a stranger himself.
But he wanted his eyes
to glow alone
so he banished all the strangers
from the city.
But one day,
this handsome inventor
came up with a device,
a special machine,
that could dim the glow
of the eyes of the strangers.
Now, of course this meant
that no one's eyes
could glow anymore, but,
at least people
could live together,
equal with each other.
But the king, he didn't want
to be equal with anyone.
So he ordered the inventor
to give him the machine.
And then, the inventor refused.
How? Everyone should listen
to the king.
Oh, no, no, no, no,
my darling. No.
Now, sometimes,
in order to be a human being,
you have to say no.
Even to the king.
[music plays over record player]

[metal clinks]

[dramatic music]
[dramatic music intensifies]
I'm Spencer.
What's your name?
Abby.
I'm hallucinating, aren't I?
Oh, please. Do not worry.
I teach the new recruits,
and I'm gonna teach you, too.
You see, sometimes things
are not as they seem to be.
Don't be afraid.
There is this unique gift, uh,
about one in ten people possess.
Something very special
has awakened within you.
Now you are one
of the few that have it.
This very special gift awakens
in people at different ages.
Sometimes in infancy,
sometimes in adolescence.
How old are you, boy?
I'm a girl.
Uh, wait!
There was a boy that we
snatched away from the faceless.
Never mind.
But... But how do the inspectors
not know about this place?
Well, they are rather squeamish
about coming here.
[Spencer] For them,
we're the scum of the Earth.
They don't want to soil
their uniforms.
They don't like the stench.
But where are we going?
Uh... But, uh, who are you?
Uh...
[ominous music]
Nikas? Anybody home?
Once again, Nikas was my father.
I am Marcus.
How do you teach
the new recruits
with the memory of a goldfish?
Uh, fish, I like fish.
Hmm...
Look what we've got here.
Hello, little lady.
Look at the elephant.
[zaps]
Irreversible process.
Typical case.
So, I did get infected.
The epidemic.
Epidemic? Did she say epidemic?
Is she sick?
We are all in danger.
There is no epidemic.
Epidemic is just a cover
the authorities use
to justify taking anyone
with a gift.
A special gift is very powerful,
and the authorities,
they don't like that.
[crackling]
[bubbling]
But what do they do
with people they take away?
They keep them somewhere.
We don't know where.
Ugh! How many times
do I have to tell you...
don't touch anything,
don't drink anything in my shop.
Remember the time that...
Oh, of course.
You don't remember anything.
Stay here.
Norman, where have you been?
Have you fixed it?
[whimsical music]
[paper rustling]
[whimsical music]
[Marcus] What the hell was that?
You said you fixed it!
Stop talking.
Go and fix it.
Now! Hmph!
[crackles]
[suspenseful music]
[buzzing]
[explosion]
Inspectors! Run!
[rebel 1] Run!
The faceless!
- [rebel 2] Run!
- The faceless! Let's hide!
[suspenseful music]
[clatters]
[bottles clank]
[suspenseful music]
Guys!
Guys, I'm so grateful to you.
If it wasn't for you,
my heroes,
this city would be a ghost town.
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys!
[inspector 1]
They're disgusting!
[inspector 2]
Let's get out of here,
before our uniforms
start to stink.
Let Marcus have the new girl.
He needs a helper in his shop.
Barney, Barney, Barney.
This girl has
an extraordinary gift.
Her power destroyed
half the street
when she picked up an engine.
You have to teach her.
- I'm Bale.
- Oh!
I don't have time
to babysit little girls.
We attack the day
after tomorrow.
And we need everyone
to get ready.
Only you can help her
reach her full potential.
I'm begging you.
Only one training session.
Just look at her.
All right. One session.
If she fails,
don't ever ask me again.
- Take her to the base.
- All right.
Now, follow me.
[Stella] The inspectors' attack
happened all of a sudden.
We managed to get out,
but Wesley, Reed,
and Dale got captured.
Our safe houses keep getting
busted one after another?
If it goes on like this,
our entire network
will soon be undermined.
[Bale] We have to hurry,
or else the revolution will fail
before it even starts.
This uprising is a mistake.
The timing couldn't be worse.
We'd better lie low and wait.
[Bale] It's true,
there aren't enough of us.
But that means
that every one of us counts.
We have enough parts
to build engines.
And we'll be able
to arm every single fighter.
[Stella] We aren't gonna win.
We don't have
enough people, Bale!
That's exactly why we have
to strike as soon as possible.
The uprising will begin
the day after tomorrow.
Tell everyone to get ready.
That will be all.
[Bale]
I have to train a new recruit.
You've never trained
new recruits, Bale.
Follow me.
[Bale] Why are you doing this?
My father was taken.
I want to find him.
And to do that,
I have to learn to use my power.
If I teach you,
it'll be for our cause.
To liberate the city.
But my father...
I don't care about your father.
You have ten seconds
to choose your weapon.
What? A weapon?
I said choose your weapon!
[thrilling music]
Concentrate.
[crackles]
Show me your power.
[rattles, crackles]
But I don't know how.
You haven't explained anything!
You have five seconds.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
[zaps]
What did you do that for?
I wasn't even ready!
You can go and help Marcus
in his shop.
Fighting is not for you.
You have my father's
photograph on that board.
[Abigail] Jonathan Foster.
For you he's a criminal.
I'm not staying here.
I'm going to find him.
If you try to go away,
I'll find you.
And hand you over
to the inspectors myself.
[tinkling]
Dad...
What are you doing?
♪ I captured
the sunbeams ♪
They're just reflecting.
If you don't believe me...
you look for yourself.
Where? It's just me.
Wow!
There's a girl!
She just... flashed by.
That's the adult you, Abigail.
In many, many, many, many years.
You can say hello to her, too.
I'm Spencer.
I teach the new recruits.
And I'm gonna teach you too.
You can't help me.
They will never accept me here.
Bale and the others consider
my father a criminal.
I know you!
It doesn't matter
who your father is.
You are now one of us.
[gasps]
No, no, no. This is too soon.
You could hurt yourself.
Why? What is it?
It's an engine.
An engine?
No. It's an engine.
It focuses
and directs our powers.
Well, the shape determines
what they can do.
For controlling nature,
any of the elements,
you use an oval engine.
But I like
the square ones better.
They work on objects.
And my favorite is...
The triangular ones.
They work on people.
Heal them... or kill them.
For controlling nature...
any of the elements,
you use an oval engine.
But I like the square ones...
You're stuck in a loop.
Oh...
Yeah.
Let's continue.
An engine can even act
as an object.
For example,
if you need to hide something.
[metal clanking]
Wow!
I need to go home.
Whose? What? Who's here?
Right now.
Oh! Oh!
For controlling nature,
any of the elements,
you can use an...
an oval engine.
Where are you going?
I'm going home. It's important.
I forbade you to leave.
Or what? Are you going
to shoot me again?
Are you always like that
with the girls?
You don't know how I am
with the girls.
It means you're only
like that with me?
I'm responsible for you.
I don't need that.
Yes, you do.
You just don't
understand it yet.
Just let me go.
Leave her, Bale.
Inspectors are coming.
[grunts]
- Shut up.
- What the hell!
Why do you care
about this one so much?
Let her go where she likes.
If she's captured,
she could give us away.
No, there is
something else here.
I can see how you look at her.
[scoffs]
What the hell
are you talking about?
Where is the infection check
tomorrow?
In what part of the city?
From the west.
Make sure she doesn't come back.
Enough, Stella.
She's a Foster's daughter.
You know exactly what it means.
That's not your decision.
I've always supported you, Bale.
What's wrong with you?
We're on the same side.
You better trust someone you
know more than a few minutes.
Why am I suddenly an enemy?
We belong together, don't we?
I don't feel
that we're together anymore.
Can I...
go already?
[whimsical music]
[rumbling, rattling]
[metal clanking]
[rattling]
[suspenseful music]
Abby!
- Mom!
- Where have you been?
I was so worried.
Mom... I know everything.
The epidemic is a hoax.
And the inspectors are taking
away the gifted ones.
Did Dad also
have a special gift?
And what about you?
I am not like you and Jonathan.
But your father said
that he would make sure
that you would be safe.
My amulet.
Dad gave it to me.
It restrained my power.
And it saved my life
when the inspector shot me.
What?
When did this happen?
No, don't worry.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
How can I not worry?
Now you have to hide
that you are like this.
You don't get it?
We are not living our own lives.
You can't find work.
You're... barely surviving.
I'm supposed to hide then...
they took Dad away.
But for what?
After all,
we didn't do anything bad.
They deceived us.
They forced us to be silent.
And everyone pretends
that it's the way it should be.
A whole city of lies.
And if we put up with lies,
it means we agree with them,
to let them do anything
at all with us.
Free is the one who doesn't lie.
I will find Dad.
I know where to look.
Abby...
Just a while ago,
you were my little girl.
You are all grown up.
Mom... I need your advice.
There are these people,
very good people.
And they are about to do
something very big.
And they know
what they're doing.
But my intuition tells me
that they're making a mistake.
I can't prove it. It's...
It's just a feeling.
Just follow your heart,
my darling.
I have faith in you.
And you should have faith
in yourself.
Just be careful.
I love you, Mom.
[dramatic music]
Abby...
[ominous music]
Hey, I'm feeling a little off.
Can you check me?
I will check her.
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Maybe you forgot
that you're my pet inspector.
Take the mask off.
Take it off!
If they catch you, that's it.
Maybe we can call them
all over here.
And all three of you
will dance for me.
It will be fun.
Stop it, Abby.
What do you need now?
What is it?
The Sky Fortress.
And what's there?
It's a prison
for the special ones.
After they've been caught,
they're brought there.
Are you sure?
What if they're being killed?
You can't kill the gift.
It always returns to the city
to awaken in someone else.
That's why they built
the prison.
And my father helped them.
Abby, leave now.
- If they catch you...
- What's this?
Inside that thing,
there is a guide
that will lead you
to the fortress.
- Now go.
- Wait!
You have to take me
to the tunnel.
The one that leads
to the flying machine.
And where do you think
you'll fly to, Abby?
Beyond the boundaries
of this city,
there is an unknown
and dangerous world.
It's suicide to go there alone.
I won't be alone.
The inspectors
are checking the tunnels.
The only way to get through
is during the shift change
at dawn or at midnight.
Then we meet here
half an hour before midnight.
Bale.
I don't wanna lose you.
Not you, not any of the others.
Stella, you don't understand.
Too many of our people
have been taken in.
We can only defeat them
on Public Safety Day
when they're spread
around the city.
If we don't strike tomorrow,
the uprising is finished.
It's our only chance.
- But, Bale...
- End of discussion.
We attack at dawn.
Our troops will gather here.
Bale, wait.
There is no need
for an uprising.
This is the place
where they hold everyone
who was taken from the city.
We can get there
on this flying machine,
and if we free them,
they will help us...
Shut up.
I give the orders here.
You can either follow them...
or get out.
But I know a way out
of the city.
If we leave this city,
we won't stand a chance.
Who are we going
to find there, anyway?
Half of them were working
for the authorities
when they were taken.
Whoever they are,
I will not entrust the future
of this city
and the resistance to them.
Look. Even she doesn't want
to go with you.
We need to talk this through.
Talk what through?
How we're going to leave behind
everyone living in the city?
No! How to stay alive.
We are at war.
And I'm willing already
to sacrifice any life
including my own,
for the sake of victory.
And if you're not ready
for that...
you can leave now.
Why don't you want to tell us
the real reason
you wanna go out from the city?
Who are you trying to save,
Abigail Foster?
I want to save my father.
Don't you want
to save your parents?
What if they are still...
Don't you dare talk
about my parents!
Your father...
worked for the inspectors.
Jonathan Foster gave them
the device
which they used to identify
and take off our friends.
You are not here to help us.
[Bale] You're here to use us.
Did you really think
I'd believe you?
[Bale] Get out.
Are you sure the entrance
to the tunnel is on this street?
I'm sorry. I had no choice.
[ominous music]
Abigail.
Hello.
What's this? Oh!
You've changed a lot.
Much prettier now.
I can't say the same
about you, Garrett.
Such a smart girl.
You came up with a plan
to trick me.
Just like your father.
Jonathan...
did well hiding you from us.
This amulet suppressed
your special gift.
Your father didn't want you
to have any powers.
He realized that certain people
should not be more powerful
than others.
And he designed a device
that can make everybody equal.
You do believe
in what your father
was trying to achieve,
don't you?
I bet you're just
as talented as he was.
Join us.
Together we can create
the city of equals.
Where honest work
and common decency
are held the highest, not some
random gift of magic powers.
Blind and undeserved.
Are you trying to recruit me?
But I'm not anything like him.
And never will be.
Roy.
This is your chance to make up
for what you've done.
You have to kill her.
I'm not a murderer.
Kill her,
or I will do it myself.
Your turn, Ethan.
Prove that you won't have mercy
on a traitor's daughter.
Bale...

Marcus!
[grunts]
Bale.
[Stella] Bale.
[somber music]
[Marcus] Oh!
[sobs]
Gone.
All gone!
It took me three years...
to make this infusion.
Now? Not a single drop left.
Come on, you can make more.
[sighs]
[Marcus] Here. Take it.
Dab the scar.
I grew it.
I dried it, infused it.
And now it's all gone.
[paper rustling]
Bale, forgive me, please.
Hey, give it back! It's mine.
Where did you go
with that inspector?
Is this instead of thank you?
Thank you for what?
You almost got us both killed.
Because you wouldn't listen
to me.
[Bale] It's you
who should listen to me.
[scoffs]
Why should I?
Because I saved your life!
[Abigail] Actually, I saved you.
If you had not gone there,
I wouldn't have had
to risk everything for you.
Can you listen to me for once?
[Abigail] There is another way.
How did you get it?
My father left it for me.
And inside of it, there is
a guide who can lead us
to the ones who were taken
by the inspectors.
[Bale] Stop! Don't open it.
[Abigail] Why not?
They're called fairies.
Before the boundary was built,
they lived in the city
with the gifted ones.
But the inspectors
forced them into service.
But why don't you want it
to be seen by everybody?
Because now fairies
are part of a different world.
And we have to save ours.
This is what I'm fighting for.
[Bale] Ever since Garrett
killed my parents.
Bale, I'm sorry, but...
revenge won't bring them back.
But we can still save
those who are alive.
Understand this...
As soon as we cross
the boundary,
we will want to stay there.
And no one will care
about this city.
We have to liberate it.
And you're thinking only
about your father.
Yes. I haven't seen him
for ten years.
And I don't know
if he's still alive.
And I follow my duty.
Your faith has no foundation.
Maybe it needs no foundation.
But we should just
follow our hearts.
My heart wants you
to stay here in safety.
I can't stay here.
No matter how much I want to.
You and I
are on different paths.
I have no right
to hold you here.
But I hope...
you will change your mind.
Oh!
[young Abigail] What was that?
- Something flashed.
- Where?
Just like a fire.
That's not how a fire burns.
But... how does it burn?
Well, in order to light a flame,
you need three friends.
Now, the first friend is...
[rasping]
is fuel.
And the fuel is what will burn.
But the second friend is...
Air.
And air will feed the fire.
But the third friend
is the spark.
[Jonathan] And she likes to play
and fool around.
Just like you.
And without her, air and fuel
can't feed the flames.
They're friends,
but they do everything together.
Just like life.
You have to find true friends,
with which you can overcome
any obstacle.
Because alone...
you won't get very far.

[tense music]
[Abigail] Bale!
It's a trap!
They are expecting you.
There are too many inspectors.
They came
from beyond the boundary.
Fall back! Everybody fall back!
[suspenseful music]
[blasts]
[blasting continues]

Ah!

[zaps]
[engine rumbles]
Confused...
aren't you?
You would have had us
all killed,
but I found
the only sensible solution.
Stabbing us all in the back?
More like saving
everyone's back.
It hurts me so much...
to see how the man I loved
turned into an obsessed fanatic.
All these years,
you've been intoxicated
by a thirst for power.
You've drowned
the whole city in blood.
Your kind of tyranny
would be something
the inspectors
could never have imagined.
But it was you
who drowned the city in blood!
Enough.
Take him away.
[inspector 1] Move!
Get in!
[fire crackling]
[papers rustling]
[Abigail] What are you doing?
We lost.
It's the end. The inspectors
will be here soon.
Yeah. But what
about our friends?
The ones that have been
taken prisoner?
We have to get them out.
Why are you giving up?
You don't have to give up!
We still have a chance
to fix everything!
[papers rustling]
[shouts]
Listen to me!
[rattling]
[wings fluttering]
[dramatic music]
[dramatic music continues]
We can all run off and hide now.
But that's not right.
And we can only win
if we believe
in what we are fighting for.
This is our chance.
We'll get out of the city
and save our friends.
We'll find all of our kind.
Everyone who was taken
by the inspectors.
And this fairy will show us
the way to them.
[tense music]
[tense music continues]
I have no right to tell you
what to do.
You should all decide
for yourselves.
But I'm going.
And if the words "hope" and
"freedom" mean anything to you,
then come with me.
[Abigail] You have to come
with us, Spencer.
I'm an old man.
[Spencer] What am I gonna do?
This is my home.
And... I love this city.
And I've grown so fond
of this basement.
I'm staying.
No, please, you have
to come with us.
My dear Abby. I'm sure you
can manage without me.
You remembered
my name after all.
And I will never forget it...
Magda?
[door opens]

[explosions]

Bale...
You're alive.
[Bale] We have to hurry.
Watch the tunnel!
Looks like we're inside
the flying machine.
Norman...
Can you make it fly?
What a strange weapon.
Why aren't they wearing masks?
Inspectors in the tunnel!
Figure out how to fly this!
[rattles]
[clanks]
[rumbling]
[engine rumbles]
[epic music]
[epic music continues]
Look, there's a keyhole!
[clanks]
[wings fluttering]
[epic music]
Wow!
When I was little,
my dad used to tell me a story,
about outsiders who lived
beyond the boundary.
I'm scared.
What if I was wrong
and we're flying into a trap?
[Abigail] What if you're right,
and when we get there,
we're only going
to find traitors.
Working for the Security
Department.
And what if my father is
working for the inspectors too?
It doesn't matter what we find.
[Bale] What only matters
is that we have a new hope.
And it's driving us forward.
We are all here,
only because you have faith
in what your heart
was telling you.
Give me your hands.
Concentrate.
Trust your power.
[dramatic music]
[Bale] Feel it.
You must have faith in yourself.
[crash]
[zaps]
[Abigail] What's going on?
The engines stopped working.
[Bale] We don't
have a choice.
We have to go there,
and see what's going on.
[rumbling]
[metal clanks]
[tense music]
[gate creaking]
[tense music]
[tense music continues]
Who the hell are you?
[rebel 1]
Drop your weapons, now!
[tense music]
[Bale] Okay, everybody,
spread out!
Search the building
for Jonathan Foster.
[hissing]
[Marcus] Don't touch him.
He's barely alive.
Looks like his life force
has been sucked out of him.
[rebel 1]
We searched the whole place.
Jonathan Foster is not here.
My father is not here.
You were right.
My father created the device
that takes away the powers
from those who have them.
[Abigail] When I was little,
he gave me an amulet
that suppressed my abilities.
But this device
is much more powerful.
[fire blazing]
[blasts]
Well, it's not that simple.
Looks like we need
all our powers to destroy it.
[Bale] But we've lost them.
We need to look around.
Let's go.
[tense music]
[tense music continues]
[grim music]
[clocks ticking]
[ticking continues]
[clock winds]
[clock ticking]
Dad...
Daddy...
I was looking for you
for so long.
I've gone through so much.
Well, well. Abby, quiet.
And now...
I am here.
Where are we?
It's like my memories.
You're on the right path,
navigator.
[young Abigail] I looked at the
watch and I ended up here.
[young Abigail] Engine?
What, did you act upon me?
But what did you do?
What for?
Remember.
I can only point you
in the right direction.
I just wanted you to come back.
It's just a recording, huh?
You put these sentences
into my memories.
Hints.
Anything can happen.
Even things that can't.
All you need to do
is to believe.
Now, keep your head up.
Higher. Higher.
Keep it higher.
Keep your head up.
That's what he always used
to tell me.
[fire blazing]
Look, this arrow
was pointing there.
[Abigail]
There must be something.
[suspenseful music]
The sunbeam is shining
on that wall.
[suspenseful music]
[tinkling]
Dad.
Did you leave me a hint?
Abigail! My joy!
You're here!
[young Abigail]
I found the fort.
How can I turn off the device
that takes away the power
from the special ones?
I can only point you
in the right direction.
[Jonathan] Remember what I said.
You said...
me... something
about three friends.
I need three things.
What?
Warm.
Stop. You drew!
They're engines!
Engines of all different kinds.
Bravo! Right on the nose.
They all do everything together.
That means that we've got
to somehow bring them together.
♪ I captured
the sunbeam ♪
- ♪ I captured the sun... ♪
- The mirror!
[young Abigail]
It can focus their beams!
We need to combine the beams
from three types of engines.
[Abigail]
Put the engines together,
so that they point at the lens.
If we focus their beams
into a single beam,
that will destroy the device.
Abby, Norman, the inspectors
will be here soon.
Bale, my dad knew
that I would come here.
He left some clues
for me to show
how to neutralize the device
and bring our power back.
But we need time.
Okay, we'll buy some time
for you.
Norman, help Abby.

[thuds]
[blazes]
Dad, what are you trying
to tell me?
[young Abigail] Dad.
I did everything that you said.
But the engines won't work!
I found the mirror...
and the engines.
But without the power,
nothing will work.
Where are you?
Quiet, Abigail. I'm here.
[Jonathan] Shh...
I'm here with you.
Where are you, Dad?
Tell me.
[sobs]
Have you done it?
And why should I do it?
So that you can rid the world
not just of the special ones,
but of their gift as well?
So that you can have a weapon
that could destroy
the gift itself?
[Garrett] Because...
it was my request.
[Jonathan laughs]
[Jonathan] It's your order.
Be honest, Garrett.
What's wrong, Jonathan?
We're colleagues, after all.
The equality...
that we have achieved...
is a balance.
[Garrett]
Only power can change it,
and I have this power.
The power is me.
[Jonathan]
It doesn't belong to anyone.
One day, I will become part
- of this power.
- [chuckles]
It will return and awaken
in everyone.
This will be a city of equals...
of the strong, not the weak.
[Garrett laughs]
[Garrett]
Just do what I asked you to.
And don't forget
about your daughter.
Think about her.
[Jonathan] Yes.
Yes, you're right.
I have a daughter.
And I think of her every minute.
And that is why I say...
Not this...
time.
[dramatic music]
[Garrett] What are you doing?
[dramatic music]
No!
I'll always be here with you.
I need you.
You have to let me go.
[Jonathan] And you have
to go back to yourself.
Because it's the only way
to unlock the power.
[dramatic music]
Norman, he's gone.
[dramatic music]
He lives only in my memories
to help me destroy the device.
[dramatic music]
He had so much faith in me.
[dramatic music intensifies]
[dramatic music continues]
Bale?
Go back to myself...
I get it.
I know how to do it!
[dramatic music]
[dramatic music continues]
As a child,
I had special powers.
And my dad taught me
to summon them
from inside myself.
Bale.
[arrow whooshes]

[suspenseful music]
[suspenseful music continues]
[suspenseful music intensifies]
Dad...
What's past the border?
Shh...
We mustn't talk about that.
We can talk about that.
And need to.
Now everything has changed, Dad.
Abigail, I knew
you'd pull through.
[young Abigail] Thanks to you.
It's good that at least
in my memories
I can see you.
I will always be with you.
In your heart.
The new history
of our city begins here today.
[Bale] It's time to go home.
[dramatic music]
Norman, we are going home.
And the next stop is...
is Fencington.
[engine hissing]
What? No, no, no...
[both grunting]
[Marcus] Let me go!
[dramatic music]
[dramatic music continues]
