I don't knoW.
It's some kind of hunting club. They...
They all have the same tattoo.
It's a dog.
It's a bloodhound dog.
Strange that you mention this tattoo.
Why?
Because someone Was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...
...With this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.
Security tapes from this station
shoW him entering from a platform...
...Where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.
It came through
the same station in Vienna.
You Were on that tape.
Did his tattoo look something like this?

I have to take these With food.
I Wanna knoW if you Want anything.
Yeah, I Want you to talk to someone.
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother What happened?
I'm not.
She still thinks her son's in Europe.
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?
- She'll go straight to the police.
- Yeah, exactly. Someone should.
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.
Somebody starts asking questions...
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I Was a kid.
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

Jesus.
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You knoW that, right?

What are the spas like there?
They're the best natural hot springs
in the World.
I go tWice a year. It's great to get aWay
from the Italian guys.
They get to be a bit much.
WoW, hot springs?
That sounds so therapeutic.
I Wanna go.
It's very easy. You just have to

Jesus. You sure?
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right noW.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.
Okay.
See you.
No respect for me.
No respect for mother earth.
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?
Well, that's just fine.
We can all ride home in silence.
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right noW?
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.
I get to Write about
hoW beautiful this village is...
...and I get to Write about
What a raving bitch you are.
She comes back sWinging!
- Well-played.
- Thank you.
Dollar!
Dollar!
Do you guys have a dollar?
- I got it.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.
I have Smints.
Would you like a Smint?
Bitches!
Welcome to Slovakia.
You both have corner suites
With vieWs of the river.
Here are your pagers.
Perfect. Thank you.
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
Really?
Because you look like
your dog just died.
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shoWer and I'll feel better.
- All right.
- Thanks.
Oh, my God!
Hey, guys!
Yes?
For the apartment.
AWesome, dude.
Those sWords are like 1000 Euros.
Trust me, she can afford it.
Does she get, like,
a really big alloWance?
No, it's more like an inheritance.
Her mom died When she Was 12 and,
like, left her everything.
And so she keeps her dad
on an alloWance.
- Really?
- Yeah.
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she Wanted to.
Yeah. It's pretty rad.
Yeah!
Badass.
Let me see this motherfucker.
You're up, bro.
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.
Come on, man, sit doWn.
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.
I didn't knoW and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.
Dude, What are you doing? Sit doWn.
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say When she sees this?
My Wife is not gonna
really understand.
Is there some other option?
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.
Yeah.
Let's do it. Come on, man.
Why don't you sit doWn?
These guys aren't playing.
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time-
Is there any problem here?
No, no. I just didn't knoW
that this Was part of it.
Stuart.
This is not like going to a Whorehouse.
You can't just back out.
Get in the fucking chair.
Yeah.
Come on, man. Look at this.
I'm fucking proud of mine.
Look What I found!
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...
...and those little kids right there
made it.
- Oh, my gosh, really?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go say thank you.
- Okay.
They don't speak much English.
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.
Thank you.
Well, cheers.
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!
Come!
Come on, Borat.
Let's see What you got.
There they are.
Three o'clock.
- Jesus.

It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.
Happy fucking birthday, bro.
- Dude, Where you going?
- In for a better look.
Me?
Hi.
Hi.
Would you like to dance With me?
No, thank you. I'm-
I'm not nearly drunk enough.
Come on. I'll shoW you hoW.

I'm tired.
I could have helped you.
Excuse me?
Hey.
Hey.
That guy make you some troubles?
No. He's fine.
What he say to you?
Nothing. He just Wanted to dance.
He Won't bother you anymore.
Oh, he Wasn't bothering me.
Here. Take a drink.
- Thank you.
- You're Welcome.
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- Don't Worry about it.
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.
No, it's all right.
- Here, let me get you a drink.
- No, you don't need to.
- No, I insist.
- No, no.
I insist.
Beth! Beth!
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman Wants to
take me on a boat ride...
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...
...and he doesn't speak English,
but We understand each other.
Yeah. Just promise me you Won't
go on a boat ride With him, okay?
Why not?
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
Want you to stay here Where it's safe...
...We're all together,
We don't get separated.
Just promise me
you Won't go on a boat ride With him.
Lorna, promise me
you Won't go on a boat ride With him.
Beth. It's okay.

So, What brings you

Her. Firestarter.
And you?
I honestly don't knoW.
I'm sorry, there's probably...
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.
Why travel all this Way
just to talk With an ugly American?
You're not that ugly.
Really?
Well, cheers to that.
Cheers.
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.
Yeah.
I get to listen to them have sex later.
Can We sWitch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.
Oh, maybe your table's ready.
That's- That's a long story.
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...
- ... I'm sure We'll meet again.
- I'm sure We Will.
All right. Good night.
Good night, Beth.
Did I tell you my name?
No, no. I heard your friend use it.
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.
Good to meet you, Stuart.
Good night.
Lorna!
Lorna!
Lorna.
Excuse me.
Lorna!
Lorna!
Beth, I'm sorry!
You promised.

It's so secluded.
Roman, What are you doing?
Come to me.
Close your eyes.
Roman! Roman!
Roman! Roman!
Roman! Roman!

and I have no idea Where she is.
- HoW does she get back from that?
- Beth, come on!
Oh, fuck!
Beth!
I cannot leave her alone With this guy.
You knoW, you just go ahead
and I'll Wait for Lorna.

All right, good night.
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?
He's fine. But can We please go
get some rest? Come on.
Oh, you're so sWeet. No, I'm fine.
It's okay. I'll take care of her.
I'm sure you Will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.
Good night, Miroslav!
I'm sorry. He Was just so shady.
Whatever. I Wanted to fuck him, but...
I knoW you did. I'll make it up to you.
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go doWn the hole again tonight.
Do you have a AA?
Mr. Rabbit!
Come here, Rabbit!
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?
No, but I remember the last.
Well, I do. This kid Greg.
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.
It Wasn't anything he said or did, but
something Was different. You kneW it.
I knoW What you mean. It's like you can
sense it the Way an animal senses it.
Exactly. Like an animal.
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody. "
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.
But like an animal, you can sense it.
You knoW that this guy's got the balls
to do What feW others can.
And that's you after today, my friend.
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.
What We do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.
- Where's your pager?
- It's back in the room.
- Come on. What the fuck?
- I just figured you had yours.
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.
I don't Wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it-
- It's different from taking on an image.
- I am so fucking tired of talking about it.
It's time We fucking do it.
To the next level.
To the next level. No, Wait.
Isn't it bad luck to toast With Water?
Yeah. Bad luck
for Whoever meets us today.
Yeah. Let the games begin.
Hard, hard, hard.
Hey.

Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.
Sure.
