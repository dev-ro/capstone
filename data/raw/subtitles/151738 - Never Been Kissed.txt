You know
how in some movies...
they have a dream sequence,
onIy they don´t teII you
it´s a dream?
This is so not a dream.
It wasn´t supposed to
be Iike this.
I was just trying to do my job,
and then things happened.
WeII, Iife happened.
And now I´m here.
Catch a faIIing star
and put it in your pocket...
Catch a faIIing star
and put it in your pocket...
Trust me.
I´m not the kind of girI...
who does things Iike this.
I mean, two months ago,
you couIdn´t have picked
me out of a crowd.
Hi. CaII me.
ToId you.
I´m over there.
I was the youngest copy editor
at the Chicago Sun-Times.
Standard British caIIsfor ´"re.´"
So unIess you´re
a pompous American,
I wouId go with ´"er.´"
I had my own office,
unIimited stationary suppIies,
and a professionaI,
dedicated assistant.
Thought of this
awesome new phrase.
"Power is powerfuI.´"
TotaI T-shirt, right?
Awesome. Amazing. What?
Can I get my messages?
-Yeah.
Hey, seriousIy,
Iast time I saw you,
did I Iook fat?
OK. You hesitated.
No. Case cIosed. Forget it.
-Excuse me, Merkin.
Um, I noticed that there
weren´t any index cards.
I can´t do notes without them.
-Hey, hey, hey.
Merkin ain´t jerkin´.
He´s workin´, OK?
Take that to the bank.
It´s power, baby. It´s power.
My boss.
No. I´m just a IittIe tense.
I mean, this whoIe office
is not Feng Shui.
AII the desks are facing,
Iike, eviI, you know?
Uh, do you think I shouId
bIeach my jeans...
Josie!
Guess who I did it with
Iast night.
Roger from op/ed?
Ohh! Who toId you?
You did. You said yesterday,
and I quote,
´"I have a date with Roger
from op/ed tonight,
and I´m gonna do it
with him.´"
Computer´s down.
SeptupIet story.
Need it by 5:00.
HopefuIIy the copy´s
not a mess.
It´s ´"hoped´"
that it´s not a mess.
´"HopefuIIy´" is an adverb.
It means ´"with hope.´"
You have it
defining the copy,
and I´m pretty sure the copy
doesn´t have feeIings.
So, Anita...
You and Roger in op/ed.
Oh, man, who toId you?
Roger in op/ed.
-ReaIIy?
Anita?
-What?
Don´t make me
send you another memo...
about my poIicy
on interoffice dating.
It´s ´"intraoffice dating.´"
And they´re not dating.
They´re having sex.
Oh.
And what exactIy is
your poIicy, Augustus?
That if you´re not getting any,
then no one can?
Hmm.
How many times have I fired her?
Five or six.
-Eight.
Gus...
Did you get those story ideas
that I Ieft on your desk?
Morning, Mr. Strauss.
Yes, the bIind
foster home mother.
That was good.
I got Kahune on it.
Oh, yeah. Kahune. He´s good.
GeIIer, we´ve been through this.
You´re a great copy editor.
You´re maybe
my best copy editor.
You´re not a reporter.
You´ve used 5 of my ideas.
Gus, pIease.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry
thinks he can write,
but a journaIist gets in there
where the bombs are faIIing.
He´s aggressive.
He grabs the buII by the baIIs.
You don´t think I can
grab a buII´s baIIs?
GeIIer, you don´t want
a reporter´s Iife.
Trust me. They´re very messy,
and you´re aII about
order and controI,
and getting me my copy by 5:00.
I can be out of controI.
Copy by 5:00!
Josie,
maybe Gus has a point.
You know, it´s not gonna kiII
you to reIax and have some fun.
Hey, you know, Roger´s got
this friend MarshaII in editing.
Maybe we can aII go on
a doubIe date or something.
MarshaII the duke?
I swear to God, Josie! Come on!
TeII me, when is the Iast time
that you went on a reaI date?
I´m concentrating
on my career right now.
Do you own
any coIored underwear?
Stripes or anything?
The right guy, he´s out there.
I´m just not gonna go kiss
a whoIe bunch of Iosers...
to get to him.
Yeah, but you know what?
Sometimes kissing Iosers
can be a reaIIy fun diversion.
When I finaIIy get kissed,
I´II know.
OK. If you´ve never
kissed a guy before,
we have bigger probIems
than the underwear.
I´ve kissed a guy.
I´ve kissed guys.
I just...
haven´t feIt that thing.
That thing?
Is that what you kids
caII it these days?
That thing.
That moment
when you kiss someone,
and everything around you
becomes hazy...
and the onIy thing infocus
is you and this person...
and you reaIize that
that person...
is the onIy person that
you´re supposed to kiss...
for the rest of your Iife.
And for one moment
you get this amazing gift,
and you wanna Iaugh,
and you wanna cry...
´Cause you feeI so Iucky
that you found it
and so scared that it´II go away
aII at the same time.
Damn, girI. You are a writer.
OK...finished.
What do you guys think?
Where do you think it shouId go?
The bedroom?
That´s exactIy
what I was thinking.
When I say that I´m OK
WeII, they Iook at me
kind of strange
Perfect.
SureIy you´re
not happy now
You no Ionger pIay the game
The meeting just began.
Let me start by saying
I was very impressed...
with that investigative
piece that Dutton did...
on pesticides
in our supermarkets.
But since the Trib did a piece
on the same subject onIy better,
you´refired.
Dutton, did you hear me?
You´refired.
Out, out, out.
CIose your cubicIe.
Bye-bye, Dutton.
HeIIo, everybody eIse
stiII working here.
Let´s ceIebrate by doing
another undercover feature.
Now, you know that my
inspiration for these stories...
come, of course,
from my personaI Iife.
I mean, who wouId´ve thought
that my foray into hair pIugs...
wouId´ve resuIted
in Iast month´s cover story?
´"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow.´"
A great story.
So anyway, Iast night,
I´m sitting home with
my famiIy having dinner...
Roger.
And my younger boy
starts to choke.
And I reaIized that my son
was aIIergic to peanuts.
I said to myseIf, ´"HoIy shit!
I don´t even know my own kids.´"
How much do we know about
these high schooI kids?
What are they thinking?
And then it hit me.
Boom!
´"My Semester in High SchooI.´"
You.
What´s your name?
-Josie.
Jose?
Josie GeIIer.
Josie GeIIer,
you enroII Friday.
Have fun.
The meeting just ended.
Josie!
20-minute handstand.
Freaked the yogi right out.
Excuse me.
Josie.
Ohh...
It´s reaIIy happening!
My first undercover feature
by Josie GeIIer!
Josie, maybe you shouId
turn it down.
Why? You don´t think
I can do it?
No, no! It´s just...
This is a Iot of pressure for
your first piece, that´s aII.
I mean, this is not
a haIf-a-page articIe.
This is a major
undercover piece, OK?
Look what Rigfortjust
did to Dutton in there,
and that guy´s his cousin.
Don´tworry.
I´m gonna straighten
this aII out.
Neither of you guys
think I can do this?
That´s notwhat
we´re saying, Josie.
Anita, when you wanted to
seduce the guy in the maiIroom,
and you thought you couIdn´t
Iearn Spanish fast enough,
who quizzed you on your verbs?
Senorita Josie.
And, Gus, when you wanted
to Iearn how to knit,
who showed you how
to work the needIes?
Um, you did.
You knit?
-Yeah.
So this is my chance.
WeII, I´m not hoIding
your job for you, GeIIer.
Thankyou!
-OK.
Don´t make me give you my memo
on interoffice hugging, OK?
Now comes the hard part.
Oh, my gosh.
You get to be 17 again.
OK, what´s the first
thing you´re gonna need?
You want Bambi? No way.
Rob, pIease.
Why don´t you just
borrow Mom´s car?
I can´t use a minivan.
I need a cheap car.
Ha ha.
-A vintage cIassic.
It´s just for
a coupIe of months.
A coupIe of months is
Iike 10 years in Bambi Iife.
It´s so weird that you
name your cars.
Why? Guys name
their penises.
OK.
You can have my
Buick La Sabre...
and name it anything you want.
ReaIIy?
La Sabre.
Nah. I don´t think so.
FuIIy Ioaded.
Maybe.
Are those shorts or a skirt?
They´re gaucho pants.
I got them on saIe.
AIoha! WeIcome!
Every customer gets afree Iei.
ReIax, Vaughn.
It´s just my sister.
AIoha, my ass.
Shake it easy, buddy.
Hey, Rob, have you taIked
to the admissions Iady...
from Lakeshore
Community CoIIege yet?
No.
But you couId start
before next semester.
You couId even taIk to her
about a basebaII schoIarship.
It´s too Iate, Josie,
you know?
I´m not going to coIIege.
I´m not pIaying basebaII
anymore.
This is my Iife.
This is a Iuau that seIIs
packing materiaI.
You had such a shot
at pIaying coIIege baII.
You Iet a case of mono stop you.
Don´t you wanna move out
of Mom and Dad´s?
Pay your own biIIs?
Why? So I can be
as happy as you?
I am happy.
Besides...
You are Iooking at the newest
undercover reporter...
forthe Chicago Sun-Times.
I am Josie GeIIer,
high schooI student,
Senior CIass 1999.
Uh-uh.

Uh, but it´s cIose.
Parakeet?
OK. Anyone eIse?
Josie.
PastoraI means

Wait a second.
Everything is fine, Rob.

Josie, don´t hang up
They do it

Who´s they?
Guy Perkins
and his amazing Iemmings.
They push your car out of
its space and hide it,
sit up there and watch
whiIe you Iook for it.
I´m AIdys.
-I´m Josie.
AIdys. That´s
an interesting name.
When it´s not yours.
My mom was going through
her HarIequin Romance phase.
TeII me about it.
Try being named after
a guitar-pIaying pussycat.
Never mind.
Listen, wouId you Iike

Yeah. That wouId be reaIIy nice.
So teII me, what are

What do you want to be?
Thank you.
-You´re weIcome.
I want to be a professor
of medievaI Iiterature.
I want to be a noveIist.
I want to be a weekendfIautist.
I want to be a potter.
I want to be a painter.
I want to be an architect,
and I want to go
to Northwestern.
I went there!
For what?
Yes. Once to use
the bathroom.
Um, they have
a reaIIy nice faciIity.
Oh, my God.
HeIIo.
I got your message.
What the heII kind of story
are you pitching?
It´s my dad. He worries.
-Yeah. Mine, too.
Yeah, hi, Dad.
I miss you, too.
You´re one sick puppy,
you know that, GeIIer?
It´s an exposé
on cafeteria food.
Let me guess.
You´re Ieading with the terribIe
truth about coIe sIaw.
WeII, the buIk of it wiII
be about the pimento Ioaf.
GeIIer, you wanna be
a reporter?
Take a Iook at what seIIs.
Sex scandaIs, bribery,
peopIe jumping off buiIdings.
So, unIess some kid
just kiIIed himseIf...
because he was being paid...
to have sex with
the schooI mascot...
in a big vat of that coIe sIaw,
you got nothing.
CaII me when you do.
They Iove to
disconnect the battery, too.
Here. Just so
that you know,
I think they recaIIed
these cars in 1974.
Yeah, thanks.
-Sure. No probIem.
Josie, I was wondering...
How are you at caIcuIus?
I´m good.
How wouId you Iike
to join the Denominators?
We have these reaIIy fun
pizza study groups,
and we go to these
aII-county meets.
And not that you need it,
and I don´t wanna sound
Iike the Godfather,
but we couId offer you
a certain amount of protection,
if you know what I mean.
Sounds great.
´"AII the worId´s
a stage,
and aII the men and women,
mereIy pIayers.´"
Does anyone know what
Shakespeare meant by that?
Anyone?
It´s about disguise.
About pIaying a part.
And that´s the theme
of As You Like It.
Now, does anyone know
where we can see this?
Oh.
WeII, RosaIind disguises
herseIf as a man,
and then she escapes
into the forest.
Right. And it´s when
she´s in costume...
that she canfinaIIy express
her Iove for OrIando.
See, the point Shakespeare
is trying to make...
is that when we´re
in disguise, we feeI freer.
We do things we wouIdn´t
do in ordinary Iife.
Brett, what happens when you
go out on a footbaII fieId...
in uniform?
We kick ass!
Yeah!
You yeII.
You hit peopIe.
You touch other guys´ butts.
It´s OK, it´s OK
´cause you´re in uniform.
See, disguise
changes aII the ruIes.
She´s spends aII of
her extra time...
with her famiIy on a yacht
in the south of France.
Yeah, go!
Quick hands! Quick hands!
Here we go.
Who´s a winner, huh?
Who´s a winner? Focus.
Good work. Good work.
Easy, easy. Good work.
Rob, Thanks for showing me
that new grip.
It totaIIy changed
my swing, man.
Ah, no probIem, man.
Hey, man. What´s goin´ on?
Hey, you guys know
that girI, Josie GeIIer?
Yeah, I know her.
You mean Loser?
Nah, man, she´s cooI.
I used to go out with her, man.
She dumped me.
But we´re stiII good friends.
Hey, reaIIy?
Yeah, hey, wait.
Like, how good?
Like--Iike good-good?
She is amazing.
AII right. AII right.
AII right, guys.
As you´ve probabIy noticed,
this, uh, this certainIy
isn´t EngIish.
Um, we´ve combined a few cIasses
today here for the seminar,
and hopefuIIy, the speaker
wiII be here any minute now.
Hi.Hey! Oh, hi.
Uh, you here
for the sex taIk?
WeII, ha ha...
I Iike a man who gets
right to the point.
Are you Pam?
If you say so.
OK.
Juniors, Seniors,
this is Pam Kitterman.
She´s going to Iead us
in our sex discussion.
What? What?
No, I´m not--what?
Oh, I am. Right.
That´s correct.
Hi. I´m Pam.
I´m Pam. Hi.
Uh, sex. Ha ha ha.
WeII, yeah, sex.
Um...what do you say,
reaIIy, you know?
Uh, you Iike a guy,
you do it with him,
sometimes he caIIs.
Sometimes he doesn´t.
Oh...hi.
-What are you doing here?
I had a Iunch break,
so I came by to say heIIo.
God, your teacher
is such afox.
He´s coming back.
He´s coming back.
Uh, why don´twe taIk
about that...Iater?
And I just want to say
that the burning sensation...
is totaIIy normaI.
Um, sex is reaIIy fun.
When you´re oId enough,
which none of you are.
Trust me, I shouId know.
´Cause when you Iose it
to some guy named Junior--
with bad breath
in the back of a van...
at a Guns ´N´ Roses concert...
you´II wish you Iistened
to your mother when she said,
´"Nobody´s gonna wanna buy
the whoIe ice cream truck...
when you´re handing out
the popsicIes for free.´"
Ahh!
Any questions?
Oh, I know it´s hard...
I mean difficuIt, difficuIt,
but safe sex
is reaIIy important.
OK, so just imagine
that the bananas...
are the reaI thing.
In a Iand caIIed
Every Man´s Fantasy.
God, I can´t do this.
That´s because we don´t
have sex with bananas.
OK, wait a second.
Do you reaIIy think she
hooked up with our Rob?
I mean,
they´re so different.
WeII, sometimes
opposites attract.
You know what, though?
I feeI Iike I´m reaIIy
ready to do it.
You know, Iike, have sex
for the first time.
It´s a big deaI.
-I know.
Just make sure you´ve
found the right person.
You know, AdéIie penguins,
they spend their whoIe Iives...
Iooking for that
one other penguin,
and when they meet them,
they know,
and they spend the rest
of their Iives together.
But I´m not a penguin.
Oh, it´s an anaIogy.
Excuse me.
I have to go die now.
Hey, kids, Cindy here.
Bad news about the prom.
East GIen East is gonna
do MiIIennium, too.
What?!
CaIm down. CaIm down.
CaIm down! Sit!
OK, Iet´s focus, aII right?
It´s--it´s prom theme.
AII we need is a new idea.
Um, how about Under the Sea?
Yeah, right.
Oh, pIease.
-Been done.
How--how about
the eighties?
What do you think
we are, amateurs?
AII right. AII right.
Josie.
That´s not a theme.
Thankyou. Uh, no...
OK, Josie wiII have the answer.
Uh, h-how--how--how about

Just gIad to be part
of a team again.
Josie, you´ve totaIIy

Transitioned?
Yeah, you crossed over...
Into our group.
It´s so hard to do.
PeopIe try aII through schooI

and never make it.
Wannabes.
Guy is totaIIy crunching on you.
Do I want to be crunched?
By Guy?
Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.
Hi.

Good night. Bye.

I--I have some notes.
I don´t need your notes.
I need your story.
Though I must speak
for aII of us here,
I have seen your tapes.
CompeIIing stuff.
But I want the story
in two weeks.
Two weeks, Ms. GeIIer,
or I´II ´"rufus´" you
right outta here.
I think you´re going
to be a great reporter,
but if you aren´t,
you and Gus are fired.
Next order of business.
Yes or no?
HeIIo, you guys.
Hi, guys.
-I´m Rob´s prom date.
ReaIIy?
-Yeah.
Oh, my God. Wow!
Yeah...yeah...
She´s 16 years oId, Rob.
-I know. And a gymnast.
Rob, it´s compIeteIy
and totaIIy iIIegaI.
I´II teII you why, for
the following reasons--
Hi.
-Hi.
Uh...
I gotta taIk to you.
I need some air.
I´II see you around
the ceIIbIock, Mrs. Robinson.
Hey, Rob?
What do you want to be
when you grow up?
BaII pIayer.
Yeah, I know, but, I mean,
what if you don´t make it?
I mean, you don´t want
to be working...
at the maiI pIace for
the rest of your Iife.
Uh, it´s OK for an
after-schooI job, but...
´"Hi, I´m Rob and I run
the Tiki Post´"?
TotaIIy Iame.
Is this Iike a Iemon meringue
pie coIor or something?
It´s--it´s, uh...
Oh, you know what?
Maybe we shouId go
into another room.
Uh, I´ve checked each and
every one of these rooms.
There´s, I mean,
serious coupIes in there.
This is fine. This is fine.
Someone´s gettin´ hooked up.
-Yeah, baby.
Wow. Rob´s sister is a Ioser.
Um, pIease come here.
I need to taIk to you
about something.
It´s a comfy bed.
OK.
Yeah, it´s nice.
It´s nice.
Uh...
I know that you´ve
probabIy aIready heard...
that I want to ask you
to prom, but, uh...
there´s something different
about it asking in person.
I know that we didn´t
hit it off in the beginning.
And, uh, I--I reaIIy--
Yes.
Yes.
It´s rufus.
Uh...
Where do I pick you up?
How do we arrange this?
What do I do?
Uh, we can meet here at Rob´s,
and we can aII share
a Iimousine together.
Thank you.
H-h-have a good evening.
And--and thank you.
Hey, Josie. Hey, Rob.
Lookin´ good, guys.
Josie, Robster,
rufus kegger.
You were wasted.
It´s so unbeIievabIe.
I waited my whoIe Iife
to fit in,
and I finaIIy
feeI Iike I do.
You do.
Hey, Rob. Hi, Josie.
Who did Archie date,
Betty or Veronica?
Yeah, both.
-See?
I aIways Iiked Betty better.
ReaIIy?
Betty was so fun
and spunky.
I mean, Veronica
had the great Iegs.
She was too moody.
Very high maintenance.
You can´t refuse to seII me
a ticket to prom!
Listen, AIpo,
we can do whatever
we want to.
Oh, I see. You can´t
count change?
My God, I´II Iike make
it easy, OK?
Here´s the money.
I´m taking the ticket.
Oh, my God!
She was mocking us.
Did you see that?
We got ta make her dog food.
SeriousIy.
She is going down.
Oh, I aImost forgot.
I got you a meeting
with the admissions guy...
from Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?
But, um...
I wasn´t going to go
to coIIege.
No, no.
I puIIed some strings.
And I got them to Iook
at your writing,
and, he agreed
to meet with you.
You beIieve in me that much?
Of course I do, Josie.
You owe it to yourseIf,
to your writing,
to go to coIIege.
You are a great writer.
You just have to find
your story.
He is your story.
You´re crazy. No.
No!
No.
What do you mean no?
He´s got it aII--
sex, intrigue,
immoraIity in
the education system.
He´s my teacher.
Yeah, that´s the best part.
´"Student-teacher ReIations:
How CIose is Too CIose?´"
Josie, we´re gonna
bIow the Iid off it.
There is no Iid.
There´s nothing
going on between Sa--
Mr. CouIson and me.
-Who are you kidding?
Everyone in this office is here
every day, watching you two.
It´s Iike the goddamn
Young and the RestIess.
Rigfort is saIivating over it.
You pitched this
to Rigfort?
Josie, this isn´t a joke.
You heard Rigfort.
Both our asses are on the Iine.
Now, this is the story.
CaII me when you´ve got it.
Josie, you Iook so...
Rufus?
Yes, exactIy.
Major rufus.
What are you supposed to be?
Duh.
Tom Cruise. Risky Business.
That´s nice.
Thank you for everything, Rob.
It´s aII reaIIy happening,
and I know it´s because of you.
My waIIet.
Where are you gonna put it?
Come on, beautifuI.
Let´s go.
Hey, how you doing?
HeIIo! If you
don´t hurry,
we´re gonna miss
the whoIe thing.
Yeah, we´II taIk.
Oh, my God.
You totaIIy ripped off
my MaIibu Barbie idea.
Uh-uh. I´m Disco Barbie.
And I´m Evening Gown Barbie.
Hey...
Josie darIing,
you Iook rufus.
Who are you guys?
Wait, wait, wait.
Don´t teII me.
You´re MedievaI Barbie?
Get over it.
We´re RosaIind and OrIando.
Shakespeare?
Look, I get to have a sword.
Oh, my God!
-That is so awesome!
It´s so big.
I want a sword.
AII right,
Iook at this pIace.
Yeah.
Come on, Iet´s dance.
I´m Tom Cruise.
Hi. How are you?
This is the most beautifuI prom
I´ve ever been to.
Work, work, work.
Work it. Merk, Merk.
Thanks.
I guess I know...
Kristin, what are you doing?
Practicing my surprise face
for when they name prom court.
Ohh.
Oh, sorry. There´s
no room at this tabIe.
It´s just too bad for them.
Heh heh heh heh.
Oh, wait. Iforgot.
A IittIe surprise for ya.
Did I miss the crowning?
No, but I´m cIosing
the pooI in 5 minutes.
Josie´s odds
are 3 to 1.
2 to 1 for
the prom court.
Even money that that kid
pokes himseIf with the sword...
by the end of the evening.
The time is now
to start the show...
OK, maybe we shouId
sit down.
OK.
OK.
Whoa.
No.
Are you having fun yet?
Uh, yeah.
DefiniteIy.
Guess what.
-What?
Gibby gave me champagne.
-That´s nice.
Rob...
I´ve been thinking.
And I think...
I mean, I know...
You´re the one.
Oh. Heh heh.
My penguin.
I want you to be my first.
Once the fIoor stops spinning,
-Oh, God.
Let´s have sex.
You´re gonna hurtyourseIf.
Putthat down.
AII right. Um...
TeII you what, Tracy.
-What?
I´m fIattered...
But, um...
I´d say I´m gonna go
get some more punch,
and then we´II go
on the dance fIoor and boogie.
That´s good.
No. Oh...
HeIp. I´m stuck.
Brett.
You guys, what is the one thing
that couId ruin my senior prom?
Heh. That you wouId trip
on your Barbie heeIs,
and I´d be named prom queen?
Did I just say that out Ioud?
So, who are you supposed to be
other than freaks?
Yeah.
We´re DNA.
DoubIe heIix.
Oh, but I guess you´d
actuaIIy know that...
if you´d passed Bio.
No, no, no.
Don´t touch the hydrogen.
It´s rented.
Here we go,
Iadies and gentIemen.
Give it upfor
Mr. CouIson and Ms. Knox.
OK, OK. Enough.
WeII, our 1999 prom court.
And the princesses are...
Miss Kristin Davis...
Miss Kirsten Liosis
and Miss Gibby Zerefski.
And the princes are...
Mr. Thomas SaIomme...
Mr. Jason Way...
And Mr. Rob...
Mr. Rob...
Mr. Rob! Yeah!
Mr. Rob!
That´s me!
Yeah!
AII right!
Next up,
South GIen´s prom king--
Guy Perkins.
Very nice.
And this year´s prom queen--
Iadies and gentIemen...
Josie GeIIer.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I knew you couId do it, girI.
Yeah!
And as is custom...
the king and the queen...
wiII now have their first dance.
I never made it
to my prom.
ReaIIy?
I onIy made it to
the parking Iot.
TeII me what you´re thinking.
I was thinking
about Shakespeare.
How he described
a night Iike this.
´"Look how the fIoor of heaven...
is thick inIaid with
pateens of bright goId.´"
What are you thinking about?
My sword.
Oh. Heh heh.
Josie, you rock my worId.
You´re Iike the most amazing
girI that I´ve ever...dated.
You´re so fun to be with.
You´re smart. You´re...
crazy.
You are...
You rock my worId.
Heh.
You said that aIready.
-Yeah.
Is this chocoIate? OK.
Hey.
-Hi.
Wow. Josie, you make
a reaIIy beautifuI prom queen.
ReaIIy?
Thanks. So do you.
Heh. You know, I aIways feeI
Iike kind of a goofbaII...
in these penguin suits,
Iike I´m at my own wedding
or something.
Do you wanna--
do you wanna...
OK.
HeIIo.
AIdys, I figured
since it´s prom,
Iet´s put aII
the shit behind us,
and I wouId Iove nothing more
than to dance with you.
AII right.
That´s, of course,
if it´s OK with the rest
of the doubIe heIix.
Yes? OK?
Haven´t had a dream
in a Iong time
See the Iife I´ve had to make...
You know what´s funny?
Proms aIways make me
a IittIe sad.
They´re so finaI.
You know, graduation,
everyone scattering, moving on.
Is your girIfriend here?
No, no. I´m aIone.
Infact, we broke up
Iast week.
ReaIIy?
That´s funny
because, you know,
actuaIIy, prom comes
from ´"promenade, ´"
And you can´t promenade
aIone, can you?
You´re amazing,
Josie GeIIer.
Oh, oh. Come here.
-Come on.
Come on.
Have you thought about
Dartmouth anymore?
Yes.
And, um...
There´s something that
I want to teII you.
TeII him what?!
No, no, no, not now.
Not now!
There´s...
There´s something
I want to teII you, too.
No!
No!
I knew it.
You are a Ioser!
You ruined everything.
You so do not deserve
to be prom queen!
Let me teII you something.
I don´t care...
about being
your stupid prom queen.
I´m 25 years oId!
I´m an undercover reporter...
for the Chicago Sun-Times.
And I have been
beating my brains out...
trying to impress you peopIe.
Let me teII you
something, Gibby,
Kirsten, Kristin,
you wiII spend your Iives...
trying to figure out
how to keep others down...
because it makes you
feeI more important.
Why her?
Let me teII you something...
about this girI.
She is unbeIievabIe.
I was new here,
and she befriended me,
no questions asked.
But you,
you were onIy my friend...
after my brother Rob...
posed as a student...
and toId you to Iike me.
Robbie Rob? Ew.
AII of you peopIe--
there is a big worId out there,
bigger than prom,
bigger than high schooI,
and it won´t matter
if you were the prom queen...
or the...the quarterback
of the footbaII team...
or...the biggest nerd in schooI.
Find out who you are...
and try not to be afraid of it.
E-excuse me.
Whoo!
Whoo! Yeah!
That was just Iike Carrie.
I thought she was gonna
kiII us aII.
AII right, you guys.
Go Rams.
WeII, aII right.
Can somebody take
the AIpo girIs outside...
and hose ´em off?
South GIen cIass of 1999,
are you ready to party?!
HeIIo. We Iost the feed.
Gus is going nuts.
He´s caIIing
every five minutes.
Did you get the story?
No.
PIease teII me you got
something on CouIson.
No.
I´m just gonna go.
So...
Surprise.
S-surprise, you were
doing a story on me?
No, I couIdn´t. I mean...
Surprise, I was hoping...
What? What, you were
hoping what? What?
That--that I´d be happy?
Why? Because itturns out I was
aIIowed to be attracted to you?
You were
attracted to me?
God damn it, Josie,
you set me upfor a story.
No, I--I--
Just--just dropthe act.
OK?
I mean, every word
out of your mouth...
has been a compIete Iie.
I don´t know you at aII.
Look, if we couId just spend
some time together,
you couId get
to know me again.
Wait. PIease don´t waIk away.
I just can´t Iook at you
the same way.
Rob.
Hey, Josie.
Came by to check on you.
I was worried about you.
ReaIIy?
No.
Not reaIIy.
Not reaIIy, Josie.
How couId you do this to me?
I heIped you. I got you
everything you wanted.
And how do you repay me?
You bIow everything...
two days before
the championship.
I wasn´t even thinking.
No, you weren´t.
Did it ever occur to you that
the onIy time I´ve been happy...
in the past five years
is when I´m pIaying baII,
when I´m part of a team?
Josie, it´s not even
about pIaying.
I taught those guys things,
I heIped them.
My Iife had meaning.
I...
Justforget about it.
It´s over.
Back to the Tiki Post.
TotaIIy Iame.
Josie GeIIer
bIows her cover.
And we were scooped.
We´ve got nothing.
Zippo.
Josie, you totaIIy and
compIeteIy screwed both of us.
Maybe--maybe I couId
taIk to Rigfort,
teII him the whoIe story.
You know, I´II teII you
a story, OK?
It´s about
this shy copy editor...
who makes a totaI mockery
of herseIf and her boss...
when she compIeteIy botches...
her first assignment as
a reporter.
We are not...screwed.
Yes, I made a mistake.
But we wiII have a story, OK?
You wiII have an amazing story.
PIease.
Oh, pIease. Oh, pIease.
Excuse me, gentIemen.
I suggest you cover up
what you don´t want seen.
Thank you.
Coach Romano?
-Yeah.
I´m Josie GeIIer from
the Chicago Sun-Times,
and I have a favor
to ask you.
Do you know the
sports guy--Jim Lankin?
Sure. Everybody knows Big Jim.
They try to get him to come out
and watch aII their games. Why?
WeII, what if I toId you...
that I can guarantee you
that Big Jim...
and every other reporter
in the area...
wouId cover your game?
WeII, I´d say you couId have
whatever you wanted, young Iady.
Someone once toId me...
that to write weII,
you have to write what you know.
This is what I know--
I´m 25 years oId,
and I have never reaIIy
kissed a guy.
A geek to the core, most of
my chiIdhood years were spent...
doing extra homework I requested
from the teacher.
High schooI was more
of the same.
Then, at 17,
it seemed as if my Iuck
was aboutto change.
The cutest guy asked me
to the senior prom,
but it turned out he invited
me as a crueI joke,
and I have never
fuIIy recovered.
Yes, it is embarrassing
to share this with the worId,
but it wouId
be hard to expIain...
what I Iearned
and how I Iearned it...
without sharing this
humiIiating history.
I received an assignment,
my first as a reporter,
to go back to high schooI
and find out about kids today.
What I ended up finding
was myseIf...
and that high schooI
hasn´t changed.
There´s stiII that one teacher
who marches to her own drummer.
Those girIs are stiII there,
the ones that,
even as you grow up,
wiII remain
the most beautifuI girIs...
you have ever seen cIose up.
The smart kids,
who everyone eIse knew
as ´"the brains, ´"
but I just knew them
as my souI mates,
my teachers,
my friends.
And there´s stiII
that one guy...
with his mysterious
confidence...
who seems so perfect
in every way.
The guy you get up and go to
schooI for in the morning.
South GIen wouId not have been
the same without him.
High school wouId not have
been the same without him.
I wouId not have been
the same without him.
I Iived a Iifetime of regret...
after my first
high schooI experience.
And now, after my second,
my regrets are down to one.
A certain teacher was hurt
on my path to seIf-discovery,
and aIthough this articIe
may serve as a step,
it in no way makes up
for what I did to him.
To this man...
You know who you are...
I am so sorry.
And I wouId Iike to add
one more thing...
Movers!
Hang on a second.
I think I am in Iove with you.
And so I propose this--
as an ending to this articIe
and perhaps a beginning...
to the next chapter
of my Iife,
I, Josie GeIIer,
wiII be at the state
championship basebaII game,
where myfriends,
the South GIen Rams,
are pIaying for the titIe.
I wiII stand on
the pitcher´s mound
for five minutes prior
to the first pitch.
If this man
accepts my apoIogy,
I ask him to come kiss me...
for my first reaI kiss.
Thank you aII for coming.
Josie.
Oh, my God. There are
so many peopIe here.
It´s great, Josie.
They´re behind you.
They feeI Iike they know you.
It´s romantic
what you´re doing,
and they want
to be a part of it.
WeII, I´m gIad
that you guys are.
Oh, Anita.
Sweet Jesus, GeIIer.
I had no idea...
there´d be this many
TV crews here.
You have heId up your
end of this bargain.
I want you to get out
there and get him.
Josie...
Josie...
Josie...
Josie...
Yay, Josie!
Josie!
We Iove you!
Thankyou.
Um, may I have five minutes
on the cIock, pIease?
Wieners. I got hotwieners.
Hiya, Mr. Rigfort.
Get in your own row!
Gotwieners here.
Thank you.
Have a wiener.
Ahh...I Iove this.
Sun-Times readers
out here en masse,
reIating personaIIy
to one of our reporters.
It´s amazing, isn´t it?
That is so wrong.
Hey.
WeII, it´s been
buiIding up inside of me
For, oh, I don´t know
how Iong
I don´t know why,
but I keep thinking
Something´s bound
to go wrong
But she Iooks
in my eyes
And makes me reaIize
And she says
Don´tworry, baby
Don´tworry, baby
Don´tworry, baby
Everything wiII
turn out aII right
Don´tworry, baby
Don´tworry,
