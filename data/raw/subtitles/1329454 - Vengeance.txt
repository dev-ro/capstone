Where are you now, honey?
Honey, we're at the gate.
Don't run!
Take off your shoes!
- You're not too wet? - I'm fine.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Take off your shoes when you come home
Mom!
I'd like to see my daughter.
Sorry?
I'm looking for my daughter.
Her name?

It's a miracle, she's still alive.
Don't worry, I'm here now.
I'll do everything to save you.
You want to tell me something?
Wait.
I'll point to the letters.
When you choose one,
you squeeze my hand.
Who did this?
3 men...

One lost his ear.
Avenge me.
I'll find them.

Madam, a hotel guest...
saw someone with a scar on his face.
Hello.

You don't recognize anyone? No?
What do you want?

My daughter.
My son-in-law.
My grandchildren.
I'm a total stranger here.
I need your help.
We're...

and a big house in Paris.
They're all yours.
Who...kill?
I don't know. I'm relying on you.

Rest well in Paris.
I'll do what I promised you.
Be silent, whatever happens.
Mom!
Don't open.
What should I do?
They saw your face.
What do you think?
My daughter bought these.
She was a good wife and mother.
She would want you to enjoy the food.
Enjoy the food.
Enjoy the food.
There are three men.
One put weight on left foot...
and use gun in the left-hand.
One shot gun, One Mad Max...
and One Magnum.
And one got his ear blown off
by my daughter.
That makes it easier.
I'm gonna need a gun.
You know how to use a gun?
The spring could be tighter.
When last time you use a gun?
Twenty years ago.
Who are you?
A chef.
Chef?
Chef my ass!
We're here for Tony.
Tony!
Thanks.
Cousin.
Cousin!
I need a colt Double Eagle.
I like it.
Cousin?
Do you know anyone
who has a Mad Max short rifle?
I sawed one off last year.
For a guy called Python.
He and his fellas own shops
at Hong Kong's Seafood Market.
That's a cool name!
Bye, Cousin.
We go to Hong Kong.
Look for hitmen there.
Take care!
Let me borrow your place in Hong Kong.
Let's eat when I'm back.
We're there.
Where are we?
Hong Kong.
Look for your enemies.
Wait
So?
Done.
Tell Kwok to collect
the remaining balance. Hurry!
Remember that guy who has the bandage
And the other one with the plastic bag.
They are the one's
who killed your daughter's family.
The third guy is not here.
"Les Frères"
"Les Frères" is the name of my restaurant
It means "brothers".
The restaurant is on the Champs-Élysées
Now it's yours.
They're leaving.
Maybe they'll take us to the third guy.
We're back.
Welcome.
Thirsty? Want a beer?
Daddy!
Hey, hold your sister's hand.
Hey, careful!
Did you bully your little brother?
Did you manage to buy everything?
I got everything. I got them with me.
- Where did you go play earlier?
- The beach.
The beach? Was it fun?
It was a lot of fun!
Great! Come, eat something.
I'll show you how to throw it.
Try to catch it!
Make it turn!
Daddy, daddy!
You hitman too?
You killed his family.
We did what we were paid for.
But why the children?
They saw our faces.
I made a bad decision.
Who's behind the hit?
So, what are you waiting for?
They don't have to see this.
Honey, dinner's ready!
Daddy, come eat!
Coming.
Thank you.
Come with me.
Sit down!
Thank you.
Honey, you know them?
No, just acquaintance from work.
Sweetheart, daddy will make it for you.
Are you hungry?
Uncles, Daddy sends this.
Thank you!
Enjoy the food!
They killed my daughter's family.
I won't take their food.
Bring this back home.
Honey, drive carefully!
Have fun with your friends.
Don't come home too late.
Sure, go to bed early.
Say goodnight to Daddy.
Bye bye daddy.
"Brothers"!
My enemies...My enemies...
Costello!
Talk to me!
Did they get away because of me?
Don't worry. We'll find them.
I've been shot once before.
The bullet...
is still in my brain.
The doctor said I'll lose my memory.
I don't know how much time I've got left.
But l...
must take revenge...
before I forget everything.
You...
police...before?
We're in the same business.
I thought so.
Done.
