Our great king killed
During his visit to France, our heroic king Aleksandar
and the French minister of external affairs Barthou
who welcomed him in Marseille...
have fallen as a victims of the brutal
and terrible assassination.
The Marathon Family
(Marathoners Are Running The Honorary Round)
Six months later, a town in Serbia
He is finished.
Good afternoon priest Djura.
He was a long man.
He wasn't long but tall.
He is tall when he is alive,
and when he is dead, he is long.
My daddy says that every man has
three measures:
height, width and length.
Coffin store "SECOND LODGING"
What is this: 2m 28cm?
Length.
What... What length?
Of that deceased.
2m 28cm...
Yes.
One cannot send you anywhere.
You idiot! Where did you see a man with
such length?
You bungler! May your eyes drop out!
Where did you see?
Can't you take even a simplest measure?
Well OK, I was also surprised that he was
that long,  but what now...
Wait, did you take that job?
Yes, you told me.
Well I did tell you to measure a man
and not a giant, you idiot!
I will never go to take measures
for you again!
I fuck your arrogant sun...
I don't want to be a gravedigger any more!
Sorry Mr. Rajkovic,
they are somehow a bit louder
I will ask them to be more silent.
Daddy!
You killed me!
Well I fuck your glowing sun
You want to make my life bitterer, right?
If I hear you again I will cut of
your heads with this saw!
You are disgracing the house and
driving customers away!
Daddy! Daddy!
I fuck your glowing sun!
Milutin!
What? Why are you shouting as soon as I
lay down a bit after lunch?
Well daddy...
You are doing all that on purpose.
You want to place me into the grave
before the time.
As soon as I close my eye you start to
scream, to shout, to bang...
Here, you even woke my daddy up!
Yes daddy! I just told them that!
But gentlemen, you can't fuck with us.
Two of us are indestructible!
The one who goes on us is fucked up
on the spot!
I know what you agreed!
You want this bastard to become the boss
you are praising him and pushing two of us
to the grave, that's your plan!
Grandfather, don't insult my child.
What child? That's a cretin!
My dear fellow citizens,
I have the honor to inform you
that your cinema "New Europe" will
begin to work again.
Kids, this is for the ice-cream,
but you need to run trough the town
and shout that the cinema works again.
"Cinema works again,
cinema works again!" Go!
"Cinema works again, cinema works again!"
Djenka! You're back.
I am. Who trashed you?
I was teaching him wisdom a bit.
And I could also teach you.
You drove this fool crazy with
that cinema of yours
so every decent job is hard for him.
Where are the fuses that I have ordered?
Here, I have brought them.
Is that all?
All. Spare ones are also there, since
your current is weak.
You really arranged this...
Eh, I was thinking to invite all prominent
people next month from the city,
to arrange a formal opening of the crematorium,
and to present THIS as an owner.
But the kid does not want to work his job!
Gentleman wants to become a comedian.
Crematoriums are the future in
all civilized countries.
Yes, that is true. I've just seen
that around in Germany
when I was buying films and looking
for these fuses of yours.
People don't want to be buried in
mud and clay any more.
Cultural man does not want to rot for years.
It is over with old-fashioned funerals.
We have to keep it up with the world.
Everything can fail, disappear,
only death is a steady job.
Lucky! Lucky, fast!
That is it now again?
He died while I was giving him a medicine.
Grandfather, grandfather
Just don't tell papa that his father
is dead. That would finish him off!
His daddy will always be alive for him.
His friends should also be informed.
His last friend died by the end
of the last century.
Eh, grandfather, grandfather.
My heart will break.
Djenka, let me ask you something,
but you have to tell me the truth, will you?
Did you have something with Christine
while she was playing in your cinema?
With Christine? Nonsense. Are you crazy?
Well, OK, sorry, I'm just asking.
She cannot play in my cinema any more.
Why?
From tonight I'm playing only tone movies.
I do not dare to tell her that.
It would upset her a lot.
This is for you.
A magazine?
After all, if she cares so much,
tell her to come to the cinema tonight.
She can play during the commercials.
And send greetings to her.
He stole the car. Get him!
Get away, grandfather!
Stop!
Daddy!
Stop! Stop!
Daddy is asleep, now we can talk freely.
What did you want to propose, Lucky?
Well I don't know how to say that to you.
What is it all about?
Well, Lucky thinks...
I don't think. I only propose,
and you decide.
What in the hell to decide if
I don't know what is it all about? Talk!
Quiet, brother, you'll wake the grandfather.
He only knows how to shout.
Here: Lucky thinks that one of these days...
No, already tomorrow.
Shut up! Shut up! Let him finally say!
To cremate the grandfather.
What to do?
To cremate Pantelija.
To burn the deceased.
In that furnace?
That is not a furnace.
That is the most modern crematorium.
Someone has to be the first.
It would be the most honorable
in front of the people that
one of us opens the crematorium.
Pantelija founded this company of
ours hundred years ago
and it is right that he is now
honored by being a pioneer
of a new development.
This is how it is, son:
I agree that this miracle starts working.
We invested a lot of money.
But by no means I accept that
you practice on my grandfather.
You burn somebody else before him,
so that I can see how it goes,
and then you can also burn him.
This way or no way.
What does it mean? Should I run out
to the street, grab the first passerby,
throw him into the stove, only to cheer you up?
I have spoken. Otherwise I do not agree.
Christine!
Christine!
Are you crazy?
Last time daddy wanted to kill me
because you broke the gate!
Djenka is back! I came to take you
to the cinema!
Go to hell you fool.
But it is true Christine, I swear
to my mother, I've just been with him!
Christine!
Stop getting on my nerves. Can't you
see that I'm practicing for the film?
What am I doing to you Christine?
You are breathing next to my ear like a mule!
You are lying that he was back.
You never believe me anything! Why?
Let's go to the graveyard,
I have to report to my father.
Let me go! Let me go you fool!
I have told you one hundred times:
men don't exist for me until I get married.
But I love you.
Yes, sure, you love me. I also love you,
but I don't attack you.
Respected audience, as you have been
informed by the posters in our town
tonight in my and yours cinema for
the first time we shall see TONE MOVIES.
Tone movies are the perfection of
the art of film and the film technology,
tone movies are the eyes and the ears
of the world.
Balkan Film presents:
Production: Artistic-Film Belgrade
Unfinished symphony of a city
"A Story Of A Day"
Following characters are taking parts
in the movie:
A deserted bouquet of roses...
A pair of patent leather shoes...
Office manager... Young girl... A man in a bar...
Congratulations Djenka.
What's the matter with you?
Are you sorry that you are not playing?
I shit in your tone film!
Silence! Now her!
Are you normal? Are you normal?
Yes I am!
How you are? You ruined me!
And how about you ruining me? I was good
enough untill you brought this screaming!
Out! Get out you corrupted gang!
Go!
Christine darling! And you Topalovic!
Get married or leave her alone!
Here is Mirko.
I will kill him for steeling the car!
Billy the Python!
Wait.
Hello Billy.
How many?
Two.
New?
Well, almost.
Mud Billy.
Clay.
Eh, his mother...
Well, what can I do. I also don't like.
That's he we the job is.
OK, unload this, c'mon...
Not tonight.
I beg your pardon?
I said no, Mr. Milutin.
Why not?
My money first.
Ha! You Are you fucking with me. You are really fucking with me,
I thought that it was serious...
This is the most serious for me, Topalovic!
In January you said "money in April"
It has been one year since
you made that promise.
Don't lie to me any more!
If you don't deliver the money, the house will go!
What will happen to the house?
I will burn it!
Listen bandit, if you mention our house again,
I will get drunk of your blood!
Try Lucky! Help yourself!
Easy Billy. Easy, wait.
Wait.
Lucky is a bit nervous. Pantelija died,
so that upset him.
Calm down. C'mon, take a walk.
Billy, please get into the house so we can
talk like men.
I understand you, but you should
also understand me.
I pay these two who are digging.
I pay two graveyard guards.
I pay people who inform me.
Everybody ask, I just pay. Where from?
20 years I work for your company,
I dig the coffins out,
you just clean them from the mud,
lacquer them and sell them as new.
Is that so?
It's so.
In 20 years you didn't make a single new coffin.
It's all my merchandise. Is that so or not?
It's so.
I was working honestly,
I was exposing myself to a risk to be
caught and sent to a jail.
Now I ask that we settle accounts and that's it.
If you have no money to pay the debt,
I have a proposal.
Let me hear.
I want my 40,000 to enter the building
of the crematorium.
I count that it is somewhere around a third.
That we become partners?
Right.
That we share the earnings from the crematorium?
That's so?
That will not be.
Well then... all the money on Saturday.
I swear to you, Milutin Topalovic,
your house will go if you don't pay the debt.
Did you understand?
I know what you want.
To divide us, right?
To throw that whore of yours into our house!
Please, please. Solve the problems of your
kids on some other place, not here.
You will pay for this, Lucky.
I will kill you sooner or later.
I will castrate Mirko. Only if I
see him with that witch again!
Oh, God, who do I live with...
Djenka...
I believed that you were smarter than
those gravediggers of yours.
You are worse than them.
You disappointed me deeply.
I was defending Christine.
I wanted to do a serious work with you.
You are pure idiots.
You are not worth working with at all.
Not even in 200 years.
You will never be your own boss.
Leave that.
I will be my own boss.
I decided to marry Christine,
and I will go tomorrow to ask her.
So i thought... I wanted to ask you
if you want to be my best man.
I mean if you want.
Calm down!
I will pour pitcher of cold water
on your head!
Hey, what are you doing?
Well... I'm hanging my picture.
And why?
Well I assume that I am the founder
of this new business.
Put the grandfathers picture back or
I will try the furnace with you.
OK, I just tried to see how it looks like... here..
C'mon, c'mon, faster, faster, bridegroom!
Which bridegroom? What bridegroom?
He was askeing the money from me
this morning, he wants to get married.
Did you give him?
Yes, but over his nose. I fuck your...
YOU will get married!
C'mon...
Oh, how heavy it is!
90 kilos!
If this burns in 5 minutes,
a deceased will in a minute.
What are you doing for gods sake?
He is not ready yet?
He will be in a minute...
I told you only to rinse him,
and not to stir him two hours.
Should I also wash his hair?
Splash him completely into the water
and send him urgently to the crematorium.
Burning almost began.
Are you really burning?
In two minutes I want you ready
and down in the crematorium.
my honest condolences...
Come here.
No way. It's too much for one
photographing, really...
You will get more if you separate
Mirko from that whore.
From which whore?
That Billies.
She will ruin my child.
She drove him totally crazy.
Not only that she is older than him
and from a bandit's house,
but she is a whore!
Imagine this: this morning he asked me
most seriously to marry her.
He didn't!?
I skinned him from spanking!
How do you mean that I separate them?
Don't fuck with me!
You messed up so many marriages, and you
cannot break a single shitty relationship!
I messed up marriages?
If you separate them,
you can ask whatever you want from us.
Attention! It is exactly twelve o'clock. Mirko...
As soon as Lucky turns on the switch,
you all stay frozen,
you look at me with a smile until I say "enough".
OK
My dear fellows, in this fateful
moment for our family,
wish us lots of luck and success.
Something's wrong. The current is weak
or the stove is not running.
Take that out that we see what's left.
Olja, take grandfather Maxa out.
What is this? Mmm, it smells.
You wanted to burry mu grandfateher in this shit!
We will burry Pantelia as it is
appropriate for a baptised man!
And if somebody mentions this miracle to
me again, I will break his head!
People, this is not so bad.
Enjoy your meal, bridegroom.
It's good.
I will fix that tomorrow.
Isolation has burned.
Daddy says to bring a piece of bread dipped
in meat sauce to his father.
I'm going...
Grandfather likes that most of all.
You know, Pantelija is tasty.
This was the last time that you hit me!
If you break the gate again,
you will have to deal with me!
What's the matter with you Mirko?
Nothing, daddy was beating me a bit, nothing...
He was beating you a bit? How do you look like
when he beats you a lot?
Is your father at home?
He is.
I came to ask for you in marriage.
To ask for me in a marriage?
You didn't ask me anything.
If your father agrees I will ask you.
Listen son, I will tell you straight:
my daughter is everything to me.
Many were asking for her, but I didn't give her.
I said "you will marry the right man or
you will not get married at all".
Is that so? That's so.
That is so daddy.
I see that you are a honest boy. But
you're weak somehow. Indecisive. Inferior.
That family of yours does with you
anything they want.
They seized everything, conquered, usurped,
and you are the ultimate cripple in that house.
Yes, yes, that's so, yes...
You are doing the worst jobs,
everybody are beating you,
you never have your money, you have to ask
from them everything and to wail,
you don't know what's yours, man!
They cannot do that for long, I swear to God.
Yes they can.
They cannot!
Tomorrow they are opening Pantelia's testament.
They are ought to give me my part!
That's right boy. Now you look like a man.
Christine! Go to the room!
If they swindle me, I will kill them all! All!
Wait, just easy and clever.
I know them 50 years, they are great bandits. Sit.
When is the funeral?
At 5. But I won't go.
Don't talk nonsense again!
You have to go. You must not let them
exclude you from the inheritance.
They are hardly waiting for that.
When they open the testament and when
you find out what is your part,
then come to me so that we make a deal.
They owe me lots of money, you know.
With that part, and with the one you will
get from Pantelija,
you could become the owner of the
whole house. Understand?
Now, if you are not clever...
Where is Mirko? He is not with you?
With me? No.
He is with that bitch again.
Listen Djenka: save our house however your can.
If that is necessary I will build a cinema for you.
Lucky!
I'm coming! If that is necessary...
Lucky!
And where is priest Djura?
He didn't want to come.
Why?
He says that we are sinful.
Read Lucky. Nobody else will come anyway.
I will daddy.
Our dear father.
The moment has finally arrived to send you
the last goodbye.
You died in your flourishing old age...
Lucky... Lucky, don't make trouble!
Give me the gun!
I don't have it, I didn't take it.
Here. I have to take care of everything.
It's nice, Billy, that you came.
I didn't come. I'm going to my wife's
grave, I appeared by chance.
Get lost. No one appears by chance on
Pantelija's funeral.
Wait kids, stop. There is time. The other time.
I have something very important to tell you
after the furneral.
Where are you going? Did you also come
by chance to the funeral?
No. I came to ask when are you going
to open the testament tomorrow.
What do you care?
I want my part. You will not trick me.
Oh I fuck your sun! You want
a part, ha? You want a part?
You cads! Dont you have any respect
even in this holy moment?
Calm down at least until we burry the grandfather!
Silence!
What's the matter wit you Mirko?
You are same as these guys of yours.
Come on, everything can be settled in a nice way.
Lucky, continue.
Ehm... Our dear father, you know that our
house always had a great...
... misfortune with women.
As one gives birth to a male child,
she fades and withers like a flower.
From this reason there is no one today
to mourn you by crying.
Our dear father, you died toward the
very end of your life.
From this reason we today...
Daddy! Daddy!
Grandfather!
He is alive.
Daddy, give me your hand! Daddy!
Give me your hand!
Come on! Come on, get him up!
Is not worthwhile for him to get out
from the grave at all.
What did you say? Give me that shovel, please.
Hit the trash!
Wait daddy.
How are you, grandfather?
Drive faster.
It cannot be faster, we are rushing 30.
Of course it cannot when you
silly son ruined the machine.
And don't turn around but drive.
Don't mention him to me daddy, please.
How did I make him like that!
I will exclude him from the
testament for that insult.
He won't get a plugged nickel!
And what do you think, that
I will give him something?
Watch out!
What was that?
You hilted a man,
that's what it was!
Was I telling you to watch
where you drive, you ox?
What man? Where are
you going, daddy?
Listen to your father, you animal!
Get out when I tell you.
Come to see the lantern, you fool.
Look daddy, that is Mr. Rajkovic.
What's the matter with him?
Nothing now.
You killed him as a rabbit.
Shall we hide him in a forest?
Shut up you fool. Hold. Pull there.
Move daddy.
Away from me with the dead!
Death is a transmittable disease.
Then transmit to the
front seat, come on.
I will.
Get him here.
You messed this up.
Close and drive.
If you really... want to be
the best men I agree but...
... only on condition that...
... he becomes YOUR witness.
That you and me get married?
Of course. I didn't have
anything with him, and...
Christine, honestly speaking, I thought
that you were a woman of modern ideas,
that you are above these
provincial nonsense like marriage.
I didn't really think that...
Now I see that I was mistaken.
I believed that two of us would
understand each other in the right way
I thought, one day we will
found a big cinema
that we will travel all around the
world, that we will make movies
that we will go away from this... desert.
But you are prepared only to be
a wife of a... little gravedigger.
Christine, Christine...
What you did yesterday, believe me,
it disappointed me deeply.
You ruined everything. Everything.
But if you are brave for
a real artistic life for two,
come. Everything is forgiven.
Djenka...
Djenka!
Djenka!
Christine, where are you going now?
Leave me alone!
Christine!
Djenka!
Don't be afraid.
Oh, a bit easier, we will fall...
Hold on!
That's right, just hold firmly!
Don't ride over the holes, I will fall!
You hold also.
We are going to my place.
I will show you something
that you didn't see.
I will show you how to make a movie.
Lets' go Lucky, take him out.
Huh, I would never come across the idea
about using this well.
People, please dont do it.
I beg you in the name of God.
I don't have any more strength left
for cleaning the well.
I am sorry, but 
what are you talking about?
There are 10 more wells around,
but everybody is dumping into the mine.
If I did not get stroke now... 
I never would.
That's right kids, that's right...
Excellent! Excellent!
Bravo Mirko! That's right!
And now you take her in your arms and
kiss her in the direction of the camera.
Should I close my eyes while I kiss her?
Who is he going to kiss?
Well, you.
That will not be.
But why? Didn't we agree?
Didn't I tell you that she will
not want to kiss, Djenka...
You shut up, no one asked you anything.
Djenka... Can it be without kissing?
It cannot be without kissing!
When two get married and come
home, I suppose that they kiss!
How you don't understand that
you two are not you two,
but you are acting the
other two who kiss?
Come on, please, don't make problems!
It goes.
Enough. It's not really good.
Enough, enough! Why did you
press like hungry years?
You smeared me completely!
Let's go further kids, like this:
you escaped from the wedding,
torture, stupid traditions
and even more stupid morality.
For the first time you are alone and free.
You are trying to forget everything
that reminds you on you previous life.
You are taking your clothes off.
With disgust you are rejecting the civil cover.
You lie in the bad naked and you laugh.
Free for the first time. Let's do it.
Are you crazy?
Painters were painting naked people,
and who finds something
wrong with these painters
and with these people on paintings today?
How can I call the movie "free life" if
you don't want to lie on the bad naked?
It's a shame to steal, to be
a thieve, to tell lies, to cheat,
but it is not a shame to be naked!
If it were a shame to be naked, people
would be born dressed, and not naked!
Human body is the greatest
perfection in the world.
Calm down, we didn't know that. You only
told us that we will make a modern movie.
You two don't know anything, you are
just making nonsense and problems.
You are really acting like two cretins.
Now I will show you how
primitive and stupid you are.
Turn off that lamp. And sit here.
You are guilty for all of this.
You see, this actress started like this:
naked in the river.
Without false shame and disgrace.
And now she is the most popular star
of Hollywood, famous Hedy Lamar.
The richest actress in the
world of the art of film.
She has two houses with pools,
she has five hand made cars.
And she doesn't know what
to do with dollars and gold.
But she didn't pretend to be ashamed.
This was what she was doing, you see?
I ask you and beg you for your own
good to undress and lie down a bit,
and you almost killed me.
Yesterday I played a tone film, and you
broke into screaming and howling.
Djenka...
There is no more "sorry Djenka".
You gambled my trust away.
I... what's that...
I killed myself of work and
running because of you,
and you are paying me back
one insult after another.
You are primitive as if
you grew up with bears.
You would like to be actors, but still
to live as the worst petit bourgeois.
You disappointed me deeply. Deeply.
Make a decision finally what
do you want in your life.
If you are interested in your gravedigger's
life, go immediately out of my sight.
I don't want to deal with gravediggers.
You ruined me.
Is that finished?
Finished.
Get out.
Get it up.
Open.
There is nothing.
Nothing.
How, when I know that
he was buried here...
He had two brick plants
and several shops,
I was told that he was
buried with a pile of gold.
Daddy! Daddy!
What was that?
A pheasant.
What was that, a pheasant?
A pheasant.
It scared the shit in me.
Somebody else is also digging.
That's why the coffin
is empty. Come on!
Topalovics! Get down!
Something is rustling.
Something is moving.
Where is it moving?
There. You hear?
No. Dig Lucky. There is not
a living soul on this graveyard.
OK, OK. Grandfather, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
Daddy! Daddy!
Get out of my grave.
At once. I'm getting out
at once. At once.
Daddy, wait for me...
Daddy, wait for me.
At once. At once.
Good evening.
Run!
Why do we need music?
We don't open a testament every day.
It is more festive like this.
I have never been so exited.
Read.
My dear fellows,
I will be brief and clear as always.
All of my property, that is the house,
the farmstead, the workshop,
the shop and the securities
I leave to my dear
great-great-grandson Lucky.
To me?
He leaves everything to me.
Daddy is that possible?
I know that he loved me
very much, but...
Read!
I am of the opinion that he is the most
capable to continue the affairs that I began.
Please, read on, I feel some weakness.
Forgery.
You bandit. You falsify
the grandfather's will.
I was just listening as you were
usurping the whole estate.
May police get you for
that hitting, murderer.
When did you find it?
where late grandfather
left it, you bandit.
Read.
My dear fellows,
The day has come that I have to say
good-bye to you, my dearest.
I write this, and my hand is trembling
from the sorrow and from the pain
You vagabond! You chose such
a man to falsify!
You said that you don't know
where the testament was.
Continue daddy.
My heart loves you all equally,
but as the nature prescribes and orders
I must single out my son Maximilian
and kind grandson Aksentije...
Let us se that testament...
You old trash, you are hundred
years old and you lie and cheat
and you even attack me!
I was just kidding...
Silence! We will talk later
about that disgrace.
And that is supposed to be the real will?
You have doubts in me?
No, daddy.
Thanks God, I have been living a
century and a half in health and work
I feel this is the time to die,
so I am telling these words
in the pen of my friend lawyer Milic
because I don't have any trust
in you altogether, kids.
I am sorry that you are mine, and
not the kids of some enemy of mine.
One who knew you could bear
the hell easily.
About my property, and
that interests you the most,
I can announce to you the following:
All I have I leave to...
... myself.... Pantelija.
To whom is he leaving?
To himself.
How can a dead man inherit himself?
He is making fools of us
even after his death!
Billie will dig you out, I'm telling you.
Grandfater, grandfather,
you really are a pig.
So how big is my part?
Like this.
If you are crazy you are not deaf.
You hear what is written.
So what, then I didn't
get anything, is that so?
Eh, what a tough guy...
It cannot go like that!
I want to know what belongs to me!
Did that whore send you to rob us?
Here is what belongs to you.
What is it?
You will remember me! Yes you will!
Daddy sounds a horn. Please
take a look what does he want.
I don't care what does he want.
I have been serving you enough.
Mr. Billy was warning me that I would
not get anything from your family.
I was serving this guy for 15 years
and he didn't leave me anything.
Perverted trash!
Here daddy! Here daddy!
Our condolences. Sit.
Here are our models.
Sorry that you had to wait.
Sorry, who...
Brother.
Older man, right?
40 years.
Shame.
What did he die from?
Tuberculosis?
He was killed last night.
Killed?
Yes, somebody killed him and
left him on the graveyard.
Lucky, child, take care of mister.
Daddy has to take the medicine.
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Sorry, is it known who did that?
I would like to find that out first.
And what would you do?
Judge summarily?
Oh no, no... I would be
judging him for a long time.
I would take him to a mountain,
I would tie him to a tree, and...
Cut by cut! Piece by piece!
Calm down please.
Calm down. I understand.
I would be cutting him one month.
Calm down!
Stop! Stop!
Here, all the receipts, regularly signed.
How much money is in them?
Check it yourself.
How much?
42,150 dinars.
Without the interest?
Without.
Good.
Don't be afraid, grandfather. I don't falsify.
Mirko stole the car again.
Oh, I fuck his robber's father!
We have more important
things to do now.
Lucky serve the guests.
Me to serve?
Serve!
Hey Lucky, is that a rat poison?
Daddy please...
Don't be afraid, Billy. Look.
Hey grandfather Aksentije, did you maybe
give a rat poison to Mr. Rajkovic also?
Which Rajkovic? What Rajkovic?
What what Rajkovic?
Enough with fooling!
Let me see the money if you don't want to
drag ball and chain in a jail for a murder!
Christine!
Christine!
Djenka!
Djenka!
Bravo girl, you look marvelous!
Just swim.
You look better than Hedy Lamar.
That's it, that's it, that's it...
I can't any more.
Just swim.
That's it; tap your feet a bit.
That's it.
In the rhythm of the music.
Now go slowly towards the shore.
My beauty, we will make a miracle!
I knew that you wouldn't let me down.
I returned because of you.
My batheress!
Wait a bit.
Talk.
What are you doing?
Well... We are practicing.
We are trying for the film.
You will do the same, but tomorrow.
I will kill you.
Why?
I will kill you!
Don't be a bitch!
I didn't, I swear to my moth...
Christine!
Christine!
Stop!
Christine! Stop!
You fool!
Everybody was telling me
that you were a whore!
Everybody! And I didn't believe!
You have been with everybody, you were
only driving me away like I was mangy!
Mirko is not a fool.
He is not a fool as you all think.
I will show you all, I fuck your sun...
We were robbed! We were robbed!
He picked up all the money that
we prepared for Billy, look!
Who daddy? Who?
Who? Who? That freak of yours,
who else would steal in this house?
I was telling that the rat should be killed!
Was it me that you chose
to swindle here?
What do you think, that I am a fool?
I want the money and I want it now!
Don't you see, are you blind?
Don't you see that we were robbed?
You have your finger
in that, understand?
The money is in your house,
by that whore of yours!
Why do you play a fool here?
Don't bark!
Get out of my house!
No! No!
Oh, I fuck your...
Listen shitter! I will wait
for you at 6 by the lake.
Take the money or a gun.
You are challenging me to a duel?
Come, or you will all go to jail.
And what do you think, how long
are you going to spend in a jail?
I didn't kill anybody!
You were fucked by the one
who gave you the steering wheel!
If that fool of yours does not
bring the money back,
you also get your ass
out of the house!
Don't, don't daddy. Billy will
kill him in the morning.
What?
That madman of yours wanted to
kill me, I barely got out alive!
Why?
Because I listened to you!
Because I wanted to separate
them, as we agreed!
He attacked me, he started to choke
me on my neck, he wanted to kill me!
Don't worry, I will take his head off. He robbed us!
Get in to dress.
What's funny?
You don't have a hat.
Oh, you are so witty.
Come on, get dressed and then
you can fix the stove.
May your head disappear without a trace.
I don't want to deal with your house.
Listen: then you won't get the clothes.
OK, but this will be my last job.
Naked ass!
Did you ever shoot a gun?
Yes I did.
Where did you shoot?
On marriages.
And in what did you shoot?
In the air.
So did you hit the air?
Real duel! Tomorrow morning!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
You will shoot from this distance.
Look: you spread your arm,
you don't breathe,
support is in the right hip, and shoot.
The first bullit is decisive!
Take! Let me see.
That's the way to do it.
Shortly but fuckfully!
Yes daddy. Billy will
kill him as a rabbit!
Get out!
My respect, Mr. Maximillian.
My respect.
Pass me the tongs from there.
Tongs.
Tongs, tongs.
You were taking nails out.
No, he wants tongs.
Your chair is not running,
so you are furious?
Ah, you are joyfull, right?
You were driving... You were
driving something away, right?
Somebody scared you?
Some man scared you?
Who? Say!
What you?
Let go... Daddy! Daddy, come here!
Come on, let him explain to you what does he
want, he's been talking for a half of an hour.
What is it daddy?
Oh, I fuck your glowing sun.
I almost got a stroke.
But what?
What happened?
Daddy burned Djenka.
Only buttons were left.
He really fixed it. Congratulations.
Attaboy!
Here is Mirko! I will fuck his god!
I fuck your sun!
I killed Christine!
That's good. I was allways...
Get in the house!
Where are the weapons?
In the workshop.
Get up Lucky! Do you want Billy
to kill you in your own house?
You brought the company
to the brink of disaster!
While Pantelija was working
everything was fine.
Since you took over the job
the house was ruined.
From today you will listen to me or there
will be no you, do you understand?
I fuck your glowing sun to fuck it.
I had enough of insulting,
spanking and commanding.
And where is Lucky now?
Lucky?
Lucky?
I will kill anybody who does
not listen to me, is it clear?
Lucky!
Here I go.
We break the gate with car.
I go to this back door behind,
Lucky stands here and watches my back.
Clear.
Aksentije and Milutin stand here
and shoot in the window.
And remember: no wounded!
Cops!
What cops now?
I will see.
Where is the head?
It's me.
If it's you then come with us.
Why?
For a murder.
Of that hooker?
What hooker, I fuck your mother...
Let's go!
Go!
Where are you going?
Fast, go for a support!
Fire!
Lucky! Follow me!
Stand there and watch my back!
Topalovics!
Oh, I will fuck your mother!
Now you will se how to drive.
Find a shelter!
Fire!
Bravo Topalovics!
Kids!
Lucky Topalovic, get out!
Police!
You are surrounded!
Run over that guy there!
I will spill his intestines!
