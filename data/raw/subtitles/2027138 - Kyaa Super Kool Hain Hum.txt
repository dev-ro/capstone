Welcome, John.
So tell us, how was your experience...
...after trying this product.
What do I say, Suzy?
This product has

I was very worried,
because I had a dark complexion.
Look.
This is what I looked like before.
Oh my, God. John,
you look so different.
Thank you. Thank you.
This is the magic of
Total Body Whitener.
I had such a dark complexion...
...that when I was in Africa,
the people there...
...would call me 'Kaalia'.
My wife would have to look
for me with a torch at nights.
I was very frustrated in life.
That's when I found out
about Total Body Whitener.

Just one part of my body is dark now.

That's why you are bouncers.
He's with me. Kitchen staff.
Right.

These days people do anything...
...to get in such parties.
Take us for instance...
Thank you, shall we?
- Fine.
The entire Page 3 crowd's here.
- I know.
Look. Mrs. Godrej,
What a cool lady.
- You know her?
No.
- So, how do you know she's cool?
She makes fridge.
You...
Let's go.
Look, there's your prey.
Rohit sir.
Are you saying this guy's
following you everywhere?
Yes, what do I say?
He's either standing
at the office gates...
...or the Studio entrance.
I don't understand how
he knows where I am.
Thank God he's not here.
This guy's really affecting me.
I can hear his voice.
I can see him too.
Sir, one chance. Please.
Excuse me.
Ekta.
How can you tell me now
that the DJ isn't here?
My show starts in 10 minutes.
What? The DJ hasn't arrived.
What am I going to do about the music?
Sir, why don't you try me out.
Try you out, I would love to.
But what about the music?
Sir, I meant the music.
Why don't you try me
out for the music?
You think you can handle this.
Sir, I've played everywhere.
From Amsterdam to Bushi Dam.
Trust me.
I like confident men like you, come.
Sir. Once chance, please.
This time I'm going to blow up
the car, tempo, even the train.
In fact, I am thinking
of blowing up the set.
I'm just searching
for a new action hero.
Someone take him away.
It happens. This often happens...
...when people can't
find work for a long time.
What're you looking at?
That's for girls.
I know.
But I am thinking of
buying one for me.
I'm going through a bad period.
Buy two.
Don't I look smart?
That's called natural acting.
Acting?
You always look like a
rape victim on television.
Do something respectable.
Soon, my destiny's going to change.
I've a meeting with famous
astrologer Sunita Menon.
All we have is loose change.
We're living in a rented house.
And you're wasting
money on astrologers.
Hello. Who's this?
What? Hold on. Hold on.
What kind of girls call you?
I asked Who's
speaking and she says...
...I am... I am wet.
I think she's in distress.
I'll solve her problem.
Hello.
Yes. Yes.
No, no, I am not busy at all.
Just a minute.
It's the vet, the animal doctor.
Dr. Gila Sukhani.
Fool.
You and your Gila,
sit here and... talk.
Hello. Hello, Dr. Sukhani.
Yes, sure.
I'm on my way. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Money problem's been solved.
It's true.
Every dog has its day.
It's the time... of separation.
May I... come... in?
Hi, Sid.
Sorry for the delay, Dr. Gila.
I hope you... didn't mind.
- No, no, not at all.
Hi, Sakru.
By the way, all said and done, Sid.
Your dog's got lot of style.
- I know, I know.
It's called... doggie style.
Doggie style. I like it.
I was talking about Sakru.
Yes, of course.
Pug la.
Hello.
- What?
Pug la.
Sakru. My handsome baby.
Sid. You must be so
proud of him, right.
Proud.
I am proud of him.
Since he's stood up.
On his feet.
I don't have to do anything.
Expenses, EMI's. He pays for it all.
Look, Madhubala and
Chinky are here too.
Hi, Chinky. Hello, Chinky.
Sid. Sid.
This is Madhubala.
That's Chinky.
Hi, Chinky.
- Hi.
What's the music for?
- For him.
He can't perform if
he's not in the mood.
Oh, really.
I didn't know even
dogs use MOODS these days.
Before his mood's turned off,
let's begin. - Sure.
How cool are we.
How cool are we.
How cool are we.
How cool are we.
We can just keep going on.
By the way, Sid.
I must say.
Your dog...
Has lot of stamina.
He learnt it from me.
Naughty, naughty.
By the way, there's
something I want to show you.
Give you.
Gift.
Gift. Gift for Sak...
Sakru.
Diamond locket?
- Yes.
Remember Shashikala, from
Zopley Jewellers. - Yes.
All doctors, including
me had given up on her.
Everyone said she can't conceive.
But your Sakru filled
her life with happiness.
My parents just gave birth to me.
But you're the one who's raising me.
Pug, give me a hug.
These aren't for playing rummy.
These are tarot cards.
Oh, I am sorry.
Choose one.
What did you say you do?
I want to be an actor.
Then get set for stardom.
- Really?
You are going to be famous.
Very famous.
But not through hard work,
but someone's luck instead.
A girl will enter your life.
Your soul mate.
And when she does,
you'll be offered a big film.
Where will I find her?
Her name will being with S.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Or you might not recognise her.
Go. Find her.
Okay. Okay.
No need to talk in riddles.
What do you mean?
Don't try to act innocent.
I know you're
talking about you and me.
S for Sunita.
I was talking about someone else.
I'm not going
through such a bad phase.
I am sorry. I am sorry.
'Wonder where will I find her? '
'The girl with an S.'
I think these two should talk alone.
- Why alone, aunty?
We'll talk in everyone's presence.
There's nothing to hide, right?
Yes, right.
So, tell us something about yourself.
How do you begin your day?
I mean, what's the first
thing you do in the morning?
First... I come back home.
And... at night...
- I work at night.
Work at night...
- Yes, night job.
I work at a call-centre.
Call-centre.
By the way, what about films?
I just love films.
Which is your favourite one?
Blue film.
Blue... Blue film...
Didn't you see it?
Can't say about mom and dad...
...but I did a few times alone...
- Why alone?
Blue film was a family entertainer.
Akshay was so good in the film.
Oh, that one.
So, Simran, which is your
favourite television serial?
'Mujhe... Bade Achche
Lagte Hai.' (I like it big).
Wow, me too.
That's fine, aunty.
But which is your
favourite television serial?
I was talking about the serial.
Of course.
Really.
Papa.
Look, she has big dreams.
And you know it all.
I cannot fulfil her dreams.
You don't call me
'Chintu' for nothing.
And action.
Chingham.
Chinghum.
I am Khajurao Singham.
All I eat is Chingum (chewing gum).
Now I am angry!
Now I am angry!
Cut.
Good take, Adi.
Okay. Thanks.
Call me.
- Of course.
Bye, see you.
It's often said that
models have loose character.
We'll show you a live example.
Look.
This model has given 'Fall
Collection' a new meaning...
...with her lowly action.
Watch our special
report on this topic...
...'Mere Do Anmol Ratan'.
Tonight, at 9:30.
So keep watching Kal Tak,
for the breast news.
I mean, for the best news.
Mom.
Yes, mom.
No, I am not coming home.
I am with Anu.
Mom, so what if dad can't
face anyone on Facebook.
I've tried explaining you...
...that I am just not
ready for marriage.
Mom, at least you'll think
twice before choosing a boy.
Today I finally
showed it to mom and dad.
Hello, here I showed
it to the entire world.
All the news channels...
...have been showing my
clips since morning.
What do you expect?
That's the second twin
towers in the news after 9/11.
Shut up, Sim. Dad will
kill me when I get to Goa.
Found out anything about the DJ?
It's some DJ Sid.
Once I get my hands
on him, he's a goner.
Go die somewhere else.
Sorry, sorry.
Yes.
What? Piles Ad.
Rascal, why don't you
get me some decent work?
You're my agent, not the ISI's.
Bye.
Ticket, sir. Ticket.
Madam, ticket.
Just a minute.
It was right here.
Check properly or
maybe you didn't buy one.
What the hell do you mean?
You want to say that I
didn't buy a ticket.
Look, madam...
- What?
Do I look like a ticketless traveller?
You don't have a ticket, and now...
- Look, mister.
Why don't you believe her?
She must have bought the
ticket and can't find it now.
Try to understand.
Fine, be careful next time.
Thank you.
- You are welcome.
Bye. Take care.
- Bye.
Excuse me.
Please don't mind me saying but...
...you can get another bus
or train if you miss one.
But not life, so
please don't waste it.
Seems like I'm hearing...
...the anti-smoking
campaign from Shabana Azmi.
Yes, coming.
That's your car?
- Yes, why?
And it was following the bus.
- Yes.
Why were you travelling in
the bus when you have a car?
Travelling in the bus is so much fun.
Especially, without ticket.
Without ticket?
By the way, I am Simran.
- I am Adi.
Nice to meet you. And thanks again.
Hello.
Speaking.
Yes.
What?
I've been short-listed for 'Chingum'.
Yes, sure, sure.
Okay, yes.
Thank you. Yes.
If I bag this film,
it'll change my life.
'That girl's name will begin with S.'
Simran.
Sid.
If I find Simran on Facebook...
...what should I write on her wall?
Write... No peeing on this wall.
Dude, aren't you taking
that astrologer too seriously?
Dude, please.
Her name begins with S.
I got short-listed for
the film after meeting her.
Just think.
Where do you think I will find her?
What do you think this Simran likes?
You think she likes to party.
- Why?
If she likes to party then
we should look for the best...
...and most happening dics in town.
What?
I've told you so many times,
its discs not dics.
It's ask, not aks.
One day you'll land in deep trouble.
Oh, God.
I just remembered.
I had to meet someone today for a job.
Take your CD's along.
I have a hard diks.
Sorry, Sid. You're late.
We hired someone else.
Never mind.
- Sure.
This bad phase has put my career...
It's her.
And here we go.
Hey, bartender.
- Hello.
How can I help you? You
want something to drink?
I think you didn't recognise me.
I am one who changed your life.
- Really.
The DJ that gave you
all that publicity...
...on all social networking
sites and news channels.
That DJs'...
- That's you?
And standing right before me?
Unbelievable, right?
DJ Sid.
- Anu.
By the way, you were
fantastic that night.
Really, thank you.
In fact, I want to
introduce you to someone.
You see, there's a big party
and you just have to play it.
Me?
- Yes.
Really?
- Yes.
I would love to.
Thank you.
- Come on, you've done so much for me.
It's time for me to return the favour.
You're just...
Two minutes. I'll just confirm it.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
No, no. Yeah, yeah.
I'm right here.
Table no. 15, okay.
Yes, ma'am.
Remember you told me...
...every Friday those
women hire male escorts.
Room no. 1769.
Yes, ma'am.
- So, is it on tonight?
Yes, ma'am. But why?
I want to send someone.
What are you saying, ma'am?
You know what goes
on in that room, yet...
I know, but trust me Alwin.
This guy... really deserves it.
1769.
May I come in?
Hello.
- Hello.
Actually, I came here because...
- Yes, we know.
We've been waiting for you.
Come, come, come.
Why don't you take a seat?
- Sure.
Thank you so much.
Nice, very nice.
We prefer giving a
chance to new talents.
Thank you.
By the way, your charges...
Charges depend on
the performance time.
Two-three hours or full night.
Well, our party goes
on for full night.
I hope you don't have a problem.
No, not at all.
I can play all night.
Let me know if you have
a special requirement.
That way I am quite flexible,
you know.
Yes. I give you my word.
- That'll be fun.
Actually, Even I believe
in customer satisfaction.
Sweet.
After all, my happiness lies in yours.
I wish our husbands thought like that.
By the way, what about dics?
Have you thought about that?
Why should we?
I'm sure you have it,
- Me?
No, no, no. I don't have my own.
We can hire it.
Yes, big, small.
As per your requirements.
It'll be easily available.
You just have to decide
when and where I've to play.
Look, why hire someone else
for the job we're giving you?
What?
- And now, after we told you...
...that the party is
today and its right here.
What?
Look, I never talked to anyone.
There must have been
a misunderstanding.
When you step out of here,
you won't be standing.
What?
Sir, Anu madam has sent this.
Anu madam?
- Yes.
'I'm sure... now you realise...
...what it means to be humiliated.'
Simran.
You're the bud, I'm the bee.
You've given me a heart-attack.
Searching for you has
given me a backache.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
Since I saw you, my
heart's not in control
I've lost my heart.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
In return of your love...
You stole my peace and slumber.
My hearts...
Now dancing to your tune.
You squeezed me out completely.
With not a drop to spare.
I've become an empty vessel.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
There's no one like you hi-fi.
Hi-fi. Hi-fi.
You're covered in Gucci entirely.
Yeah.
You scratched so hard.
The heart's now attached...
To you.
To you.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
You spread such chaos.
My soldier here...
Stood in attention again.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
The heart's bloomed like a garden.
The bee's lost in the foliage.
Adi.
What are you doing outside
my call centre at 4 o'clock?
Making a call.
Call?
Hello. What are you staring at?
- Nothing, nothing.
Look, I know what you're looking at.
You know.
- Aren't you ashamed?
I am, but this is how it begins.
How disgusting?
Don't judge by these ads.
It's only because
I've no other choice.
Is it you on the hot-seat?
- Yes.
And you were talking about this?
- Yes.
Why? No, it's nothing.
So, you're a model.
- No, a struggling actor.
I can see your struggle.
The first time we met, I was
convinced you had a clean heart.
We just need to clean your system now.
It's so cute.
You should frame it.
Sid.
- What is it?
Better vacate this house
in a few days. - What?
These shorts you
wear won't look good...
...in front of your sister-in-law.
My sister-in-law?
The one I think about all day.
And she's made my internet bill soar.
You're marrying Sunny Leone!
I am...
I am talking about a different one.
Simran.
Like one of those heroines...
...out of Yash Chopra,
Raj Kapoor films.
Now like today.
Fakir, Panti...
What's...
You're marrying Simran?
- Yes...
She said yes.
She will.
When I propose to her.
Listen, Sid.
Listen.
- Yes.
Tomorrow when I propose to her...
...shoot our video on my mobile.
Why?
- For the future.
Ishaan and Sarika will see it too.
Who are Ishaan and Sarika?
Our children.
Dude, you two just met...
...and you're already
planning your future.
Dude, it's my confidence.
You won't understand.
There's just one
thing I got to ask her.
Will you marry me?
And she has to say Yes.
Now... only Rajnikant can save him.
Hi.
- Hi, Simran.
So what's with the restaurant,
dinner, wine?
Will take my advantage
after treating me wine?
No, Simran. You misunderstand me.
Then what's the point
of treating me to wine.
Hello, I was just joking.
By the way what is all this for?
There's a marriage in my house.
You've to be there.
I definitely will if you invite me.
You have to.
Otherwise, the
marriage won't take place.
I've even printed the cards.
Nice.
Who's getting married?
Us.
What?
Will you marry me?
- No.
Yes, I knew it.
If it's your parents,
then I'll talk to them...
No, Adi, it's not my parents.
Is there someone else in your life?
- It's not that.
Then what's the problem?
- Problem...
The problem's...
The problem's that I
like girls more than boys.
Even Rajnikant can't save him now.
So what's the problem?
Even I like girls more than boys.
Try to understand, Adi.
I like girls more than boys.
Have you seen 'Dostana'?
- Yes.
John and Abhishek.
You mean, there it was
John and here... it's Jigna.
Ma'am, would you like
to have anything else?
Yes, sex on the beach.
Sorry, ma'am, you need
permit for the beach.
Doble sir doesn't allow it.
How sad.
Excuse me, we don't want anything.
Please go. Please go.
Go.
- Bye.
But, how did your
taste change suddenly?
After spending time with
you I realised... - With me?
But I didn't do anything.
- Exactly.
I'm sorry, Adi.
Please take care. Bye.
Try to understand, Adi.
I like girls more than boys.
Listen, if you were in
a electronics shop...
...then you would've been a convertor.
And take off this t-shirt.
You've lost the right to wear it.
You get this from the girl
for your best performance.
Look.
Don't tick me off.
Look at the bright side.
You were going to gift
her expensive diamond ring.
You saved that money, right.
She took the ring too?
Look, she isn't like that.
My heart doesn't agree.
Something's wrong somewhere.
She took the ring.
Oh no.
I lost 'Chingum' too.
What?
And you're smiling.
When she came, I got the picture...
...and when she left,
I lost the picture.
One thing's confirmed,
dude. Simran's my soul mate.
I just need to find out...
...why she made-up this story.
You're too much.
She left you for a girl.
And she took your
diamond ring as well.
Still you believe
she's your soul mate.
You should be in
Ripley's Believe It or Not.
Hello, no need to laugh.
The ring was mine, but the
diamond on it was yours.
I don't have a...
Sakru's diamond.
That ring had Sakru's diamond.
- Yes.
Rascal, he didn't just work hard...
...but a lot more than that.
I want Sakru's diamond right now.
Find out where's Simran
Find out.
Going to chill in Goa.
It's written on her status.
As soon as she got the diamond,
straight to Goa.
I think she sold the diamond.
Look, Simran isn't like that.
Right, she'll sell it
after she reaches Goa.
Come on. We're going to Goa.
That's it. Come on.
Goa.
Simran.
Finally, we're in Goa.
He's still following me.
I still can't believe it
that he already proposed to me.
I think it's sweet.
And I think he really loves you...
...otherwise he wouldn't have
given such a expensive ring.
You know, I still don't get it.
Why lie to him that you
like girls more than boys.
Anu, this guy's a psycho.
I went to see him after
he called me 400 times.
If I had said its some boy...
...then I wonder what he would've done.
Now, what can anyone do if
the girl's taste is different?
Listen, if we run into him someday...
...then we'll have to pretend.
You're just too much.
I think you're the psycho.
But forget all that.
It's party time now.
Oh, I remembered...
...I hope your dad's new
year party's happening, right?
I didn't tell you, Simran.
But after grandma's death...
...dad's lost his mind.
- What?
It was fine, until he
was collecting movie items.
But after watching 'Paa'
he's crossed all limits.
Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle all the way.
Santa Claus is coming...
Hi, dad.
- Hi, uncle.
Hi, daughter.
Dad.
- Sorry, sorry, my darling.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Where are our gifts?
- Of course, you'll get your gifts.
But first ask about my gift.
Go on, ask me.
- What?
Mother Mary has sent my mother back.
Mother has returned.
What? But grandma was...
- Can't believe it, can you?
She's been reincarnated.
And she'll be overjoyed to see you.
Mama.
Mama, look who's here.
Mother's here.
Take her blessings, dear.
What are you doing?
That isn't mother.
She's the nurse.
Mother's in her arms.
She's grandma.
Dad, how can she be your mother?
Have you gone mad?
- Mind your language.
Take mother inside.
She's my mother.
She's returned here
with the grace of Guru.
Guru?
- Guru?
Who is he?
- A great person.
He's always engrossed
in devotion, veneration.
He's been through many trials
to forsake this material world.
Guru sees all. He has divine sights.
He stood on one leg for
seven years in penance.
Don't ask which one.
And the result of
that hard penance is...
...that Guru talks to
the Lord directly.
Via satellite.
And that's why his
devotees call him Baba 3g.
Why this Kolaveri D.
Why this Kolaveri D.
Welcome, Marlo.
You've arrived at the right time.
Here you go, offerings.
Lord. Already here for the offerings.
How's everything
back home. Meera. Radha.
I hope everything's cool, in Gokul.
Didn't I tell you?
He talks to the Lord.
What?
Things aren't fine back home.
Sudama and Osama.
Didn't I tell you to get
rid of Sudama's poverty?
Now he's crossed the line.
Okay. Okay.
I'll do something.
Mr. Marlo. Send a
money-order of $15000...
...to get rid of Sudama's poverty.
- $15000.
Sudama lives in Miami.
Sudama lives in Miami.
3G, that's my daughter...
- Anu.
Anu, and she's her friend...
- Simran.
Simran.
Beautiful.
- Beautiful. - Disgusting.
Hello. What is all this?
Where did my grandma come from?
What are you doing?
Good question.
- He's still saying good question.
I realised that **** is a
mother of a great person.
And Mr. Marlo's image
appeared before my eyes.
And then, I just did my duty.
I gave him the dog and made him...
Fortunate. Fortunate.
Mr. Marlo, I just remembered.
We've to go.
It's time for her manicure.
It's time for mother's manicure.
You car's breaking down so often.
Look, even Pamela's
going through a hard time.
If it keeps leaking like this...
...then we'll reach Goa by next year.
Goa?
You two are heading to Goa?
Me too.
- Okay.
It's new year time.
I supply toots.
What?
What's he saying?
- That's my business.
I supply toots.
- What's he saying?
This is why our film
got an A certificate.
What are you saying?
- Honestly.
I supply toots to the
top businessmen of India.
Tata. Birla, Ambani.
I am going to Goa to
meet a new customer.
If you require toots, let me know.
Sakru can use it.
- Yes.
I've every kind of toot.
Every colour, every size.
And fitting's guaranteed.
Popat.
I'll leave.
Don't forget.
- Of course.
Popat! Laundry! Suites!
Suites.
That means he was talking
about suites all this time.
And we thought...
What's the point of this card?
What can I get you?
Cappuccino for me
and Al Pachino for him.
Two cappuccinos.
What's cappuccino?
What's cappuccino?
You don't know cappuccino?
We are cappuccino.
Cappuccino.
Try us too beauties.
We are cappuccino.
Try us too beauties.
We are cappuccino.
Try us too beauties.
Its buy one get one free.
Take as many sips you want.
We are here...
We are here...
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
We're like the breeze.
Everyone's amazed to see us.
When we set out in style.
When we set out in style.
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
The world claps on our dance.
Let's rap in Hindi now, girl.
Let's rap in Hindi now, girl.
Together we're a great mixture.
Everywhere we go, we hit sixer.
Everyone knows.
We're the fixer of happiness.
Together we're a great mixture.
Everywhere we go, we hit sixer.
Everyone knows.
We're the fixer of happiness.
Together we're one plus one eleven.
We're A K 47.
Madness filled in our veins.
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
You've heard UP's rhythm.
Now see Maharashtra's beats.
We're the sons of this land.
We're the kings of this land.
Our blood's filled with fire.
We're brave.
We love Maharashtra.
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to plunder Mumbai.
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
We are here to steal your slumber.
We're here to...
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
We're here to plunder UP and Bihar.
There's a question in my mind.
These days that's all you do?
Is this car taking us to Goa...
...or are we taking the car to Goa?
Let's ask someone for a lift.
Lift! Lift!
Lift! Lift! Lift!
Hold him.
Watch and learn.
We're so Kool.
We're so Kool.
We're so Kool.
We're so Kool.
What are they doing?
- I don't know.
They came up from behind...
- You said we'll get a lift.
Mister, what did you...
- No need to thank us.
You were pushing the car alone.
So we thought we
should lend you a hand.
Let's go.
I had heard about valet parking.
But this is valley parking.
Pamela's... no more.
They say those who
die go empty-handed.
But she took our money,
luggage, everything.
What... what will we do in Goa, now?
We're in a mess.
You know, dude.
You've been always with me.
When I came to Mumbai,
I didn't have a dime.
But you were.
When I got those
absurd teleshopping ads...
...I had you.
Simran broke my heart.
I had you.
She left with the ring.
And I had just you.
That's what you call true friend.
What friend?
I think you're the bad luck.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. Christmas.
Party!
We don't have money for food,
clothes or shelter.
And you're thinking about the party.
You're not going to believe this.
Look down.
Not there. Down here.
Party hosted by Trippy Gulati.
Trippy from our college.
If it's him, then we're on a roll.
Give me a five.
- This is the last five I have.
You want this too.
God.
- Come on.
Is that Trippy's house?
He must be lying around somewhere.
That's Trippy.
- He's no more.
Adi. Sid. Sakru.
What a surprise? What
are you doing in Goa?
What are you doing in the fridge?
Just chilling, guys.
Just chilling.
She left him for a girl.
And his video's on Youtube...
- I did that. Me.
Are you done?
By the way, who left
all this for you? - Yes.
My uncle.
He died 20 days ago.
He was into adventure sports.
He went to Switzerland...
...to bungee jump
from the snow mountains.
He forgot the wear the
bungee in his excitement.
And jumped down.
And then?
What else?
He jumped down, and went straight up.
- Dead.
And he left five
million pounds for me.
Five million pounds?
- Wow.
I don't know how much that
is when converted in rupees.
If you've anything
that needs converting...
...then give it to him.
He can convert anything.
Merry Christmas.
I don't understand a word she says.
But she's lot of fun.
Me... Yoko Ono.
Me, Danny Danzongpa.
Me...
You cheat. You stole
the only name I had.
Why don't you say Manisha Koirala?
She's from 1942.
Come on you two...
It's Christmas, let's celebrate.
Let's raise a toast.
To friends and good time.
Why did you pick up glasses?
You said toast.
What the... fork.
She's here.
Hi.
Hi, babe.
Yes. Tomorrow night, Adam's club.
I'll see you there. Bye.
Hi.
You!
I'm here to apologies.
The disaster with you at the
fashion show, because of me.
I am really very sorry.
Cool.
And anyway, you've settled the scores.
So... how was the
experience in room 1769.
That day I realised that...
...even men have one
respectable thing.
So... why don't you
let me buy you a drink?
Lt'll complete me apology.
Please. Just one drink.
Okay.
- Great.
After you.
So, what brings you to Goa?
Holiday or work.
I live here.
My house is just close-by.
But, what brings you to Goa?
There's something I need
to get back from someone.
Wow, nice ring.
Is your boyfriend Tribhuvan Das?
I don't have a boyfriend.
I'm surprised.
It's so difficult to find
someone loyal these days.
You know, according to a survey...
...70% of men cheat in India.
Yes, the rest go to Bangkok.
So, what's the first
thing you see in a girl?
That depends, whether
she's coming or going?
You've a wicked sense of humour.
- Thank you.
But I've to go.
- What?
So soon.
- I am really sorry.
My friend must be waiting for me.
But, it was really nice to meet you.
And... apology accepted.
I'll see you soon.
- Thank you. - Bye.
See you tomorrow, at Adam's club.
Anu, can you see if there
are candles available here?
Sure, babe, I'll just check and come.
Sim. Look what I got.
- Aroma candles, wow.
These candles are amazing.
If we dim the lights of the bathroom...
...lie in the bathtub
and use these candles...
...we'll be in heaven.
Wow.
Aren't these small?
I've got different sizes.
We'll use the small
ones in the bathroom...
...and the bigger ones in the bedroom.
It'll last the entire night.
Just can't wait to use them.
Hi, Simran.
- Adi.
Hi.
I wanted to talk to you.
Alone.
Hey, you're same loser
from Youtube, right.
You're a disgrace to men.
Disgrace!
You seem to enjoy it, didn't you?
Wish to see next part?
Come on. Alpino. Come, take a look.
See the next part.
See yourself. Send it
for the film festival.
So this is Marlo's house.
Trippy was right.
Only he can throw a
huge new year party.
Sakru, come.
Stay here. Okay.
Hey Mali (gardener).
Oh, Antra Mali.
Where's your boss?
Ma.
My ma.
Sweet ma. Mamma.
Life's filled with confusions, ma.
You're my world.
Your rebukes sound so sweet.
Sir, someone here to see you.
Someone here to see you.
Thank you, go.
I'll have to convince
Marlo... to give me the party.
But first things first.
I should drink this.
I think he's a film buff.
Badge no. 786. Film, Deewar.
1.5 crore rupees.
You've a mind-blowing collection, sir.
By the way, I am Sid.
Marlo.
No, no, no.
It is Francis Marlo.
Yes, sir. Everyone knows you.
As soon as I learnt that...
...you like collecting
movie collectables...
...I couldn't control myself.
I said, I've to meet you.
So, you too.
- Yes, sir.
And I couldn't have
come empty-handed. - Yes.
So... I brought an
invaluable gift for you.
Gift. Gift. Gift.
For you. For you. For you.
Orange juice?
No, sir. It's not just orange juice?
It's the orange
juice from 'Delhi Belly'.
Really?
- Yes, take a whiff.
Just for your collection.
Okay.
Thank you.
And this red blouse.
- Yes, sir.
Three crores.
Three crores for this blouse.
And so dirty.
I know, but... so was the picture.
Vidya Balan's blouse...
...from the Dirty Picture.
- Yes.
What's wrong? Why are you crying?
It's a long story, sir.
Back when I was in school,
everyone said...
...that I didn't
concentrate on studies.
But, sir... l'm still
hungry for 'Vidya' (education).
Me too, me too. Next.
Follow the Marlo.
Sir, sir, sir.
Where's this from?
- This.
Remember 'Sholay'? - Yes, sir.
I watched it number of times.
Thakur's servant, Ramu.
- Yes.
He would wash his
hands with this soap.
Because Thakur didn't have arms.
How much did you pay for this?
It's a personal gift
from Mr. Sippy. For me.
Curd.
Which film is the curd from, sir?
Vicky Donor.
So, that was my small collection.
Sir, in your case,
size doesn't matter.
You're very nice.
What do you do?
- Sir, I am a DJ.
By profession.
You're a DJ.
- Yes.
Then you'll play at my
new year's party this time.
Yes!
Sir, me?
- Of course.
These days there aren't
many admirers of art like you.
No, I insist.
- Sir, you're so sweet.
Always.
- Sir, you will have to hear my music.
No, no. No need.
- Just hear it, sir.
There's no need. - I insist, sir.
I said... - Hear it, sir.
Okay, okay.
Is that you?
Yes, sir.
My children.
DJ Sid, the kids are loving it.
I'm loving it. Awesome music.
Yes.
- Thank you.
Sir, sir, sir.
Please come quickly.
What happened?
- Sir, if you don't come quickly...
...it will be a catastrophe.
Rascal. Your
performance starts with my music.
I am so proud of you.
My mother's been...
My mother's been...
Hey you. You can't
endure to see someone happy.
Leave my boss's mother.
Leave my boss's mother.
She's the boss's mother?
Yes, Mrs. Rose Mary Marlo.
Rose... Mary... Marlo.
No wonder she seems
so pleased with Sakru.
Shoot it properly.
Hey, filming my mother are you.
My mother's been defamed.
Someone save my
mother from this brute.
Dog. Sorry, sir.
I didn't know my dog...
...would do this with your mother.
Your dog?
- Yes, sir.
Usually I charge for his services.
But since you've
given me a huge party...
...so, for you it's free.
You mean your dog charges
for such obscene things.
You mean the dog
that just consummated...
...with my mother is a gigolo.
No need to overreact.
Just give her an
l-pill before 72 hours.
Bloody pervert.
I'd rather take
sleeping pills instead.
But before that I won't spare you two.
I'll teach your dog a lesson, that...
Dad.
Are you okay?
- No.
I am not okay.
How can I forget what
happened with my mother?
You're forgetting something, dad.
Grandma's character.
She was so pure. So pious.
- Yeah.
And you call her
mother when she openly...
And with an unknown dog.
You're right.
Mother would never
let father touch her.
So, father would
spend most of his time...
...with the servant, Ramdin.
In fact, father did
him so many favours...
...that Ramdin would
always stay bent over.
Dad, just think.
How can she be your mother?
You're right.
How can she be my mother?
How can she be my mother?
Boss, soon you'll be unmasked.
Think of something.
We'll have to come up with something.
If the trust shuts down...
...then Baba 3G's incoming will stop.
And we'll have to be
out-going from here.
Yes, if we've to get
back to our old job...
...then we'll be in a mess.
No, broad-band.
We'll have to think of something.
Listen. Light up that S&T.
This isn't Adam & Eve,
its Adam & Steve.
This is a gay club, okay.
'Tomorrow night, Adam's club.'
'We'll definitely meet in this club.'
Anu, thanks for coming...
...to the Gay day cyber night,
and supporting our cause.
We should be thanking you.
- Yes.
First time we feel
so safe amongst men.
Naughty.
- Yes.
Cheers!
Hi.
- Hi.
Never saw you here before.
I'm from Mumbai.
But I come to Goa whenever I can.
I just love this place.
Especially the dics.
I... didn't get your name, I am sorry.
Hi, Sorry. I am Sid.
Sorry... You're so witty.
Then you're so... Churchgate.
Churchgate!
By the way, I am Adam. The club owner.
Oh, so this is your club.
What a place you have, man.
It's rocking.
- Come.
You know, few years
ago I had a partner.
Steve.
I was the active partner...
...he was the... sleeping partner.
But recently he passed away.
How?
- It was an accident.
The house next to his was on fire.
And Steve jumped in
the fire, to save people.
Steve saved seven people.
But couldn't survive himself.
Such a hero.
Later we found out...
...those he saved
were the fire-brigade.
They were trying to douse the fire.
Sid, here?
You know... you remind me
so much of Steve. - Me?
It's your personality.
Hi, Sid.
Anu. You, here!
I am surprised.
Actually, I'm more
surprised to see you here.
Why? Where else will I be?
Where there're dics, there's Sid.
Oh, you're just too much.
By the way, guys.
I'm going for para-sailing tomorrow.
Why don't you guys join me?
Para-sailing?
That's... that's such a great idea.
- No.
What will I do there?
If you don't come,
then I won't either.
She has to come.
If Sid doesn't come
then how will we have fun?
You have to come.
- You have to come.
Okay, I will come.
It's a pleasure meeting you.
Believe me, the
pleasure is all... mine.
He seems too emotional.
It's true.
All goods guys are
either gay or married.
Enough! Enough! Enough!
That's enough, Mr. Marlo.
You believed this
foolish girl. This is too much.
I am not sad because you doubt me.
But because... you
doubt this pious lady.
Forgive him, mother.
Marlo. Do you know who that dog was?
Who was it?
It was none other than your...
- Your?
Your...
- Your?
Your?
Your father.
Father!
- Yes.
Yes, Marlo.
Last night Jesus and
I went for dinner.
Our last supper.
He really likes the
'Biryani' of Delhi Darbar's.
That's when he told me...
...that your father has
returned to your mother.
To give her what he gave only Ramdin.
Chaste love.
- I see.
That's he directly...
You're absolutely right.
Prepare to bring father home.
- Of course. Of course.
Did you hear? Father's coming back.
Mother.
Good morning, Sak... ru.
Wow.
Twosome.
Threesome.
And I'm still hand-some.
What's this?
Early morning on the job.
I am proud of you my boy.
Why are you sulking?
Look in the pool.
They're just having a ball.
One thing's for sure, dude.
It's the influence of the other girl.
She is the convertor not me.
Right now there's just
one thing on my mind.
How to get Simran back into my life.
Just like Arjun saw only
the parrot's eye, similarly...
Dude. Don't ever talk the parrot.
You're hopeless
You say Simran's your soul-mate.
Soul's fine, but what about the mate?
Look at girls from
Sakru's point of view. - What?
Lmpress her.
Show her that you're a man.
It'll be difficult for you...
But we can try.
No. I mean to say... give
her the macho impression.
What?
- Give her the macho impression.
Yes, you're right.
I want to show her how manly I am.
This time I'll surely give
her the macho impression.
What?
Give her the macho impression.
He's missing, and left me with this.
Vicky Donor.
Give her the macho impression
Anu, listen.
This guy's taking off his pants here.
Yes, really.
And honestly, he's looking really hot.
Okay, I'll call you later.
Hey, you. Come here.
What?
What are you trying to show here?
Something special to show?
No, sir. Nothing special.
Really.
If you don't trust me,
you can see it yourself.
People like you give Goa a bad name.
Come on, come on.
Stop. Stop.
Excuse me, sir.
I think you're mistaken.
He's my friend and was posing for me.
Here's his photo.
Fine.
Ask him to pose
properly next time, madam.
There are children
playing on the beach.
Sorry, sir.
Thanks, Simran.
By the way, why did you take my photo?
Look, no need to find
a meaning in all this.
Don't get any wrong ideas, okay.
But...
You were smiling at me.
No I wasn't, I was
laughing at your actions.
Sakru. Where's the damn dog?
Oh no. Sid will kill me.
It's so strange, Sid.
Yesterday we met on land.
Today in the air.
It's the height of our meetings.
If you don't mind, can I ask
you a personal question, Mr. DJ?
Yes, of course.
When... did you start playing?
I mean, you know...
That's nothing personal.
I started when I was 16.
- Oh, really.
It all started in a party.
When I saw my friend doing it.
That's when I heard
a voice from within...
...Sid, you're born for this.
And then... I kept playing.
Once I went on for 24 hours,
non-stop... - You kept playing.
Oh my, God. You're a Superman.
Thank you, thank you.
But what about your parents?
Did they accept it?
They were upset in the beginning.
What will the people say?
Will I get married?
No parent would ever
want their son to do this.
For them, it was bad.
But for me, it was business.
And when I started charging,
they had to accept...
...that no matter what our
son does, he makes good money.
Wow.
The phone... in your pocket...
Is vibrating.
I didn't... bring my phone.
Okay.
'I was the active partner...
...he was the... sleeping partner.'
'You remind me so much of Steve.'
Looks like I'm on the receiving end.
Take us down.
So, how did it go?
Had fun with Adam?
What fun?
Adam thought even I
swing the other way.
What?
- I am not that type.
You are not. Really?
What really?
Why is it so
difficult to believe that?
Actually, I wanted
to go there with you.
But he did instead.
His happiness was
bulging more in his pants...
...than his face.
You... you're laughing.
No, no.
I'm just happy that
you're not like that.
No, I...
Why are you so happy to
hear I am not one of them?
I am not happy.
Actually, was Adam
competition for you?
What rubbish, of course not.
Great.
At least someone's happiness
is showing at the right place.
I'm the button on
your shirt, my love.
My love.
My love.
I'm the button on
your shirt, my love.
The clip on your hair.
Your face is prettier than the moon.
My heart's slipped out of my hands.
We've lost our hearts.
Your crazy old lovers.
We're your die-hard fans.
But you don't understand.
We've lost our hearts.
Your crazy old lovers.
We're your die-hard fans.
But you don't understand.
I've found the way to heaven.
Through your eyes.
My crazy heart's... just
followed wherever you went.
I'm the liner of your lashes.
The ring on your finger.
When you smiled at me.
I got the world.
We've lost our hearts.
Your crazy old lovers.
We're your die-hard fans.
But you don't understand.
My destiny's... changing now.
You're entering my life,
I can hear the footsteps.
I am the colour on your cheeks.
The necklace around your neck.
Since you entered my thoughts.
I don't dream anymore.
We've lost our hearts.
Your crazy old lovers.
We're your die-hard fans.
But you don't understand.
We've lost our hearts.
Your crazy old lovers.
We're your die-hard fans.
But you don't understand.
I'm the...
This is the first time...
...you've asked me to freak out.
It's Goa, dude.
Let's party.
Like they say.
Live life... king-size!
Smoking. Drinking and...
Sakru.
I think we're drunk.
Sakru looks like a cat.
- You too.
He looks like a cat to me too.
- Me too.
This stuff is killer dude.
- Yes.
Drink it, drink it.
I'll take a closer look... at Sakru.
Yes, go ahead.
He still looks like a cat.
- Yes, me too.
You know, Sakru's...
Did you hear that?
Sakru's meowing.
- Yes, I heard too. Sakru.
This stuff is...
He did it again.
I love this.
I think I'm losing colour.
That's a cat... What the...
Get up.
Leave me.
- Get up.
What's a cat doing here?
Maybe Sakru's had a sex-change?
After sex-change a dog
becomes a bitch, not a cat.
Tell me honestly where Sakru is.
For the sake of Rohit Shetty.
Look, Sid. I will have
to be honest with you.
I actually... lost Sakru.
You lost Sakru.
- Sorry.
Forget it, you aren't sorry.
I know you lost Sakru intentionally.
Hello. - Because you're
always jealous of his sex-life.
Where do I look for Sakru now?
Oh no. Francis Marlo.
If Francis Marlo
gets a hold of Sakru...
...then I won't spare you.
Here.
Hold on to it.
Because this is the only
pussy you'll ever get. - What?
Trippy. Dude.
What's wrong with Trippy?
Sakru. My brother.
My friend.
My benefactor.
My...
I knew you'd come DJ Sid.
Look, maybe your mother's
expecting because of Sakru.
But I didn't expect this from you.
A rich man like you steals dogs.
Steal!
When your things return to you,
it's not called stealing.
You forget, he's my dog.
Please. Don't call him a dog.
And that dog you call yours is my kin.
He's my father.
Father?
First time, someone's
calling himself a son of a *****.
Try to understand.
This relation dates
back to their past life.
Return me my father.
I'm willing to pay anything.
We're poor, Mr. Marlo,
but we're not for sale.
Look, he's reincarnated again...
...to fill my mother's
life with happiness.
Don't separate them, please.
That **** is your mother,
and this dog's your father.
If the dog-catchers come around...
...your family will be ruined.
Don't say that.
I'm willing to pay anything.
But I don't want Ramdin
back in my father's life.
Return me my father, please.
Return me my father, please.
So, you've taken
advantage of my emotional nature.
You've one option.
Tell me, I am ready.
No, you've another option.
Return me the party.
The party's yours. It's a deal.
This is a deal.
Sid's boxers can even
bring the dead to life.
But it has no effect on you.
I think Trippy's responding to music.
He's responding to music.
Trippy, are you okay?
Are you fine?
Trippy, what are you doing?
Get up.
You brute.
Let me go, please.
I won't be able to face anyone.
Trippy, please.
Rascal.
Every time you said 'Marie',
I thought you meant biscuit.
Now I understand why Simran left you.
Forget that, he's gone into coma.
What?
Pinto. Take this dog
away from my sight.
Wonder how gets
recharged in every half an hour?
Wonder how his master is?
Hi. Finally you're here.
So tell me, what is it
that you wanted to say?
This news will drive you crazy.
- Then don't.
One is enough.
- What?
Nothing. So tell me,
what's the big news?
DJ Sid is playing at
Goa's biggest party.
Wow, that's awesome.
I wanted to give you this news first.
Thanks.
By the way, who's hosting the party?
That's a real comic story.
You'll die laughing.
Really? He's a crazy millionaire.
He's a crazy millionaire.
Francis Marlo.
He's so crazy, that he
thinks a ***** is his mother.
And you know what's
his mother called? - No.
Rose Mary Marlo.
Then I guess he believes
a dog to be his father.
Exactly. That fool
thinks my dog's his father.
By the way, you're quite intelligent.
- I am.
And, you must've taken the
party in exchange of the dog.
You know me so well, so soon.
How can I let such a
prey slip through my hands?
Of course.
Once the party's over...
...I will leave with my dog.
How?
- What do you mean?
He's my dog.
He comes running back
hearing my special whistle.
Amazing.
Whistle for me once, please.
Are you sure?
- Yes. Please.
It goes like this. Pay attention.
What...
Very sorry, madam.
It's hard to control boss.
Boss. Madam?
The idiot, fool you
were ranting about.
Is my dad.
Dad?
That's not my dog.
These days any dog comes up to you...
This is not my doggy, I swear Anu.
Don't ever show me
your face again, DJ Sid.
I hate it.
- Anu, listen...
Anu, Anu, Anu.
'Don't hold Simran's hand.'
'So you think Simran loves you.'
'Can you keep her happy? '
'I've a car, bungalow, bank-balance.'
'What do you have? '
'I've what you don't.'
'Oh, really? '
'Maybe you don't know that... '
'... it's available in stores.'
'And it battery-operated
and comes with guarantee.'
'Look, don't compare it
with China's cheap products.'
'This girl's trying to
mislead you, Simran.'
'Come with me, Simran.'
'Please.'
Paro will have to say...
...whether she loves
Devdas or Chandramukhi.
You know, Sim. I just don't
understand why men are called dogs.
Dogs are loyal.
I just can't believe
Sid turned out like this.
Chill Anu, take it easy.
Adi.
Hi, Simran.
I came to Goa to tell you...
...I still believe you're my soul-mate.
And I cannot believe you're like that.
Trust me, Simran.
This girl's misleading you.
Hello, I am misleading her.
Do you see this, you
gave it to Simran.
And she gave it to me.
You gave her the ring I gave you.
That means...
- It means we're engaged.
Engagement?
I didn't have a dime...
...still I gave you a
ring worth 500,000.
You didn't care about my feelings.
Now I realised,
soul-mates are just in stories...
...not in real life.
Maybe I got too involved in this.
Maybe there's no
wedding ring in my life.
Just suffering.
Bye, Simran.
Bye.
My destiny's... changing now.
You're entering my life,
I can hear the footsteps.
What's wrong with you, Sim?
Why don't you admit you love him?
You're lucky to find a boy like Adi.
Look at me.
The one I love turned
out to be a cheater.
Don't lose Adi.
Hi, dad.
You can't believe it, right.
But you will have to.
Trust me.
She's the girl that's
Simran's girlfriend.
Are you sure?
- I saw it myself.
She was wearing the
ring I gave Simran.
Ring?
'I don't have a boyfriend.'
No wonder they were at Adam & Steve.
Our scene's been spoiled.
The girls we loved...
- Love each other.
I don't want that party either.
Let's just get Sakru and leave.
And anyway, there's
nothing left for us here.
There's just one good thing, dude.
You turned out to be
a convertor like me.
Can you hear it?
Welcome to the club.
What a funny game?
One stick... so many balls.
Nice shot, right?
Breaking news for you two.
I am getting married.
Marriage? At this age?
Not me, I was talking
about mother and father.
You're getting these dogs married.
Mind your language, Anu.
Just imagine. Have you
ever seen children...
...attending their parent's wedding?
But we will.
And that auspicious day is today.
Thanks to Baba 3G.
I've sent out the cards too.
Michael Marlo weds Rose Mary Marlo.
Okay. Now I will go to my balls.
Dad.
'Adi, I wanted to
tell you everything... '
'... but I am stuck in this marriage.'
Sid.
No one's at home, sir.
Everyone's attending the marriage.
- Marriage?
I feel ashamed to even speak about it.
This is not the way.
This marriage's taking place...
...even after Anu madam
and her friend revolted.
Marlo sir just listened to that Guru.
The girls are being
forced into marriage.
If he can believe
dogs to be his parents...
...then he can do anything.
We will have to stop
this marriage, dude.
Let's go.
The Devgn's (Gods) are here too.
Hi, Ajay. Thank you for coming.
Chote, once these two get married...
...we'll open a trust
in the dog's name too.
Then we'll leave for
Miami with the money.
You, me and Sudama.
Father.
- Yes, Mr. Marlo.
Not you, father. I meant the priest.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've
gathered here this morning...
...to witness this holy reunion,
of a very unusual couple.
Rose Mary Marlo, do
you take Micheal Marlo...
...to be your lawfully wedded husband.
She's saying yes. She's also smiling.
Nice.
Mr. Micheal Marlo, do
you promise to take...
...Rose Mary Marlo to be
your lawfully wedded wife?
He said wife.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
And now ladies and gentlemen.
It's party time.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Dabakar De.
The security's really tight.
How will we go inside?
We can't, but they can.
Mister and Missus...
- **** Lele.
Couldn't you find another card?
**** Lele.
What could be better than this?
That's nice.
Yes.
- I am Popat.
Okay.
I gave you the 'toot',
I'm here for the money.
What did you give me?
Hi, Sweety.
Do me nicely.
For the sake of your love.
Enough, that's too much.
Just a little.
- Enough, enough.
This is the first
time I'm overdoing it.
Just a little. A little more.
It doesn't fit, it's too tight.
Stretch. Stretch.
I think it's stuck.
- What?
Careful, or it'll tear.
Breathe in, breathe out.
I'll take care of it.
Finally. It's done.
Sid with someone else!
Lmpossible. He's mine.
Whose marriage has Mr.
Marlo invited us to?
Over the phone he said it's important.
Forget that.
We didn't come to Goa
for this surprise marriage.
We're here to explain your
daughter for the last time...
...to marry Chintu.
How many proposals
are we going to refuse?
People will say
something's wrong with your daughter.
Took the 'toot' but
didn't pay my money.
What did you say?
What did you give them?
- Toot.
I want it too.
You want a toot.
But it should be good.
- Don't worry about the quality.
The name's Popat.
Just tell me do you
need Indian or foreign.
You have international as well.
I've American...
...l've Russian, Italian too.
I can show you an album.
Album? You've come prepared.
Just tell me, how much for
short-time, and for full night.
Disgusting man.
I am talking about 'toot', and
you're talking about 'toot'.
Get lost. Get lost.
Seems like I couldn't
make it in time, Simran.
Adi. You had a sex-change.
If you return to my life, I'm
ready for a sex-change, Simran.
Adi, I am not that type of a girl.
- You're not.
And this marriage?
Uncle's getting the dogs married.
Dogs marriage?
You never thought how...
...your daughter will face the
society after this marriage.
Look at her.
She looks so sad.
Ask her. Is she happy
about this marriage?
I don't need to ask anyone.
This is my personal decision, okay.
What kind of a father are you?
Didn't you think who
will carry your family name?
They won't have children either.
Why?
You definitely need treatment.
Then why did you lie.
You directly proposed to me.
I just didn't know how to handle it.
I never came across an
irritating man like you.
But now I think I'll have to
spend the rest of my life with him.
Just like Fevicol gum.
I won't let go.
Mother.
I love you, Simran.
- I love you too, Adi.
What are you doing, Simran?
Today I will snatch
your family from you.
Let's see if he's your
brother or my... brother.
He's your dad.
Bless... Curse you.
Thank God your mother isn't here.
Otherwise this would've
given her a heart-attack.
So you wanted send
this girl in my family.
Look, you're mistaken.
He isn't... I mean,
it's not what you think.
Uncle, you're mistaken.
I am a boy.
Thank God. At least he's a boy.
Brother. Don't spare anyone.
Baba 3G, do something.
Don't worry, Mr. Marlo. I'll get him.
You still think he's your father.
Is this a marriage?
Mr. Marlo, I think
he's been possessed.
I'm sure it's Ramdin.
His name was Ramdin, but
his actions were evil.
Hey priest.
You're sprinkling
water from the bottle.
He's shedding water from his eyes.
And he's...
You did all this?
To break this marriage.
How sweet.
Thank you, Sid.
Anyway, how could I let you...
...marry someone else
against your will?
My marriage.
So what if you're Dabakar De.
Here my father's on a roll.
Do something.
Mr. Marlo. Your father's free.
Let's begin the holy ceremony.
Dabakar De! You two know each other.
Very well. Sir, he was a
dog-catcher for the Municipality.
Selling dogs to people like
you opening trusts in their name.
And toying with their trust,
that's his business.
Sir, he isn't your
father nor is he a Guru.
Because I got him
imprisoned for four years.
And he needs to be sent back again.
Is that true?
Mr. Marlo, you doubt me again.
He's your father.
Trust me.
Ravan. What?
Kick 3G Baba's arse.
Don't anyone make a move, or
else I will kill him like a dog.
Don't come closer.
Shoot. Shoot.
We're Hindi film heroes.
- We won't die.
Don't be mistaken.
Did you forget Amitabh from 'Sholay'...
...and Rajesh Khanna from 'Anand'.
They were heroes from
extra-ordinary films.
And we're ordinary film heroes.
Let me go.
This is a real gun.
Is that fun?
- Two guns.
Then hand me one.
- Which one.
The one that's less fun.
Here.
Don't take the law in your hands.
There are better things for that.
Then go ahead.
- Who called you?
What's the need to call me?
We're at the climax of the film.
This is the time for us to come.
Right.
- No!
You two opened my eyes.
Otherwise this Baba convinced me...
...to believe these
dogs were my parents...
...and I was getting them married.
Well done, boys. Well done.
Adi finally found this soul-mate.
And with Simran in his life,
he also got' Chimgum'.
Sid played at the
biggest New Year party of Goa.
And he didn't do it alone,
but with Anu.
Sakru changed his habits.
Today he's become a one woman man.
But anyway, we gave our impression...
What?
Take a picture of the machos.
The heart's swinging slowly.
The rhythm's syncing with the heart.
We won't sleep or
let anyone else sleep.
We won't stop whatever's
happening in this stupor.
Fly on the music.
Raise the volume.
Raise the volume.
Fly on the music.
Raise the volume.
The laser speed that zooms around.
Makes the frequency of
the heart go boom, boom.
When the temperature of the
party runs through the vein.
Those who are drunk,
need to be taken home.
It's the weekend, no time to think?
Dancing through the
night is not a crime.
Fly on the music.
Raise the volume.
Raise the volume.
Fly on the music.
Raise the volume.
Some move their body
on the dance floor.
That it makes the heart skip a beat.
She signals at you,
through her eyes.
Whenever you've to leave early,
you end up late night.
No one's in their senses,
everyone looks hazy.
Everyone's intoxicated,
they appear different.
Fly on the music.
Raise the volume.
Raise the volume.
Fly on the music.
Raise the volume.
Raise the volume.
Raise the volume.
