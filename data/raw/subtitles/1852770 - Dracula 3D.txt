- Tania, have you finished?
- Yes
Remember to close
the shutters tight.
- Tonight is ...
- Walpurgis night. I know.
Do not worry, Mamma,
I'll do it.
Good night.
Good night.
You scared me!
- Did you hear that?
- What?
Footsteps.
Footsteps.
Just the wind.
Walk me home.
What if they see us?
You know I'm married.
Who's gonna see us?
They're all locked up in their houses.
Milos, you can't let
me walk home alone.
You came this far.
Now, I'm afraid.
Do you have the cross I gave you?
You won't be in any danger with that.
You can keep your cross!
Tania, please ...
Go to hell, Milos!
Tania! The cross!
Oh, the hell with you!
Who's there?
Help me!
Help me!
Help
Excuse me ...
The coach to Passburg?
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
only one coach to Passburg
and it has already departed.
Well ... so
I'll have to take a horse.
Of course, sir, but ...
- Well ...
- Well what?
These woods, for those
who do not know them,
could be dangerous.
- So. The horse.
- As you wish.
What was that?
Was it an illusion?
Good evening, sir.
- You want to lodge your horse?
- Thank you.
Take good care of him.
It's a bit nervous.
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- I'll see that he gets fed.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening. I need a
room something to eat.
Certainly sir.
How long will you be staying?
- Only one night.
- Fine.
I'll bring you
something from the kitchen.
Only if Delbruck comes too.
Well.
We need you tonight.
We can not do it alone.
- Ok, now.
- Thank you.
Thanks again.
- Will this be enough?
- Yes, more than enough!.
Thank you.
4th of May.
As I rode to Passburg,
I thought I saw wolves appearing
and disappearing through the trees.
It felt like a nightmare.
And yet ...
I was not asleep.
Here!
This is the one.
It's this one!
Give me the crowbar!
Go on!
Look ...
The bite.
Hey you, leave her alone!
I won't let you hurt her!
Get away from her now!
We have to do it,
is for her own good.
Come on Renfield give me the ...
Why didn't you stay with her?
Please ...please, don't ...
- It's your fault!
- It's not true ...
It's all your fault!
Renfield. Please!
Milos ...
Lieutenant!
It's empty!
Let's get out of here.
Help me drag this
miserable carcass away.
Excuse me. Can you tell me
how to get to the Kisslinger house?
The mayor?
Come, I'll show you.
Thank you.
One, two, three, four.
No, Marika,
faster with those fingers.
Like this.
Allright.
Now try it again.
Very good.
I think that's
enough for today.
- I'll see you Saturday.
- Thank you, Miss Kisslinger.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Jonathan!
- Lovely to see you again, Lucy.
- Do come in.
- This way?
- But where's Miminah?
- Unfortunately she couldn't come.
- Lucy are you alright?
- Yes
But nothing has
happened to her I hope.
No..no  Just an annoying delay that
has kept her from coming here to visit.
But..don't worry, she will
arrive Friday on the 10:00 train.
You might think me foolish, but ...
I have not seen her
since the wedding day,
and she's like
a little sister to me.
I know, I know.
I cannot stay long,
the Count is waiting for me.
I only wanted to thank
you for writing to Mina
that you were seeking a librarian.
It was no trouble at all.
You will enjoy working for the Count.
He is a true gentleman
and has done so much for this town.
Papa says that without his help,
Passburg would still be in the Middle Ages!
You both look so happy.
And we still are.
Papa!
Lucy ...
Why so overjoyed to see me!
Good morning, Mr. Mayor!
Well I'll be damned.
Jonathan Harker!
Allow me to greet
you properly, my boy.
So, what brings you here to Passburg?
Good luck.
Why didn't you tell me that
Harker would be going to work ...
for Count Dracula?
It must have slipped my mind.
But why such a long face.
You look worried.
I'm only tired.
Come ...
let's go inside.
- Ready?
- Let's go.
- Tighten it up.
- All right.
- Here you go. You got it?
- Yes
Help!
This way,
you will never bite ...
anyone.
You like the wine, Mr. Harker?
It appears to be excellent.
The Count is always very
attentive to his guests.
And are you as well?
..er guest, I mean.
Actually ...
I'm not yet quite sure what I am.
My name is Tania.
Jonathan.
Please ...
Do sit down, Jonathan.
Thank you.
Welcome, Mr. Harker.
Count Dracula.
Yes, I am ...
Dracula.
You may go, my dear.
You must forgive
my niece, Mr. Harker.
Sometimes ... girls of her age have
a tendency to be a bit too forward.
Nothing in Ms Tania's behavior
was less than correct, Count.
You're too kind.
Please.
You would not dine, Sir?
I never eat ...
in the evening.
I have heard that
your wife could not come.
Passburg is a small town.
- She will join me in a few days.
- I'm glad.
The wife's place is
at her husband's side.
Yes.
Listen to them...
children of the night.
What music they make.
This library has existed for
more than four hundred years.
Although they were
warriors, my ancestors
always held books in great esteem.
The same holds true for me.
It does you honor, sir.
You seem impressed.
I admit it.
I have ...
How many are there?
That you must tell me.
- Is something the matter?
- No, no ...
I was mistaken.
It must be a trick of the light.
Tomorrow, my niece and I
will be away for the entire day.
Nevertheless you shall
begin to catalog these.
Of course.
Let's return to the salon.
Yes.
This evening I finally
met Count Dracula.
He's younger than I expected,
Although his behavior,
and his demeanor,
seem to somehow
contradict his appearance.
Come in.
- Am I disturbing you?
- No. Not at all.
What can I do for you?
That's .... my wife, Mina.
She is beautiful.
Yes she is.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.
God ...
Miss?
The sight of blood disturbs you?
Let me help you.
No. It really is nothing.
You don't want to get an infection.
Miss Tania!
In 1462, after the fall
of Constantinople,
the Turks invaded Europe
threatening the Christian world.
To its defence, from the
Principality of Transylvania
came a courageous
Romanian nobleman.
His name was Dracula.
He was also known
as Tepes, the Impaler
a nickname well suited to
his infamous and bloody deeds.
His cruelty was such that his figure
became cloaked in
a supernatural aura.
It is said that in order
to remain alive forever
the Count would nourish
himself with human blood.
Are you responsible for this?
Are you?
Answer me.
Don't you like me, Jonathan?
He is mine!
Never mess again!
Please don't hurt me.
Thank you, Master.
Tell me what I must do.
Good day ma'am ... May I?
Welcome.
Have a nice day. Bye-bye.
- Mina!
- Lucy!
- How was your trip?
- Fine, thank you.
- Where is Jonathan?
- At the castle.
He couldn't get away
so I came instead.
Oh come now Mina, don't look so sad,
you will see your Jonathan tomorrow.
Yes, of course.
It's wonderful
being together again.
I have missed you.
Lucy ... What is the matter?
I had so many dreams.
- Is there something wrong?
- Passburg is not exactly a good city.
You want to find yourself a
husband and have some children.
Surely you won't tell
me you have no suitors!
- I have three.
- But no one that you fancy?
You should see them
Mina, they are horrible!
Well then, a stranger, he will
come along and win your heart!
- Someone like Jonathan?
- Yes
I do love him so much.
Here you are ladies.
You said no, it was awful.
It was only a wolf.
Is that clear?
- No it wasn't and you know it
- Jarmila.
- Why must we doodle here? Why?
- Try to calm yourself, and making it get to you.
Your making gets to you!
Stop! Let go of me!
Let go.
My daughter is dead!
- Can we?
- Yes.
Can we take the bags?
Don't you just love riding on train?
Oh, yes, it is wonderful.
And get to see lots of elegant women ...
Oh, Lucy, the dresses ...
And the shoes!
Why look who is here?
- Mr. Kisslinger!
- How are you, my little Mina?
A bit tired, but quite well.
Thank you.
Is the Count's castle very far?
Well ...
to set forth at this hour, yes.
It is best not to go
alone through the woods ...
after nightfall.
Just as we arrived, we saw Jarmila
- She was with Lt. Delbruck.
- Poor woman.
Why?
What happened to her?
Several nights ago,
her daughter was killed by a wolf.
And she's had no peace since then.
- That is terrible.
- Ah, yes ...
But enough with all these sadness.
Tonight, we must celebrate.
I've ordered lamb for dinner.
You like lamb, Mina?
Oh yes, I do.
Well then,
what are we waiting for?
You must be famished.
My lady ...
please ...
You must be hungry.
If I did something wrong...?
On your knees!
Going to the city,
Morio?
To alert the authorities.
You drawn everything.
Milk?
No, thank you.
Biscuit?
You look dreadful.
My bones ache.
- You have a fever.
- No, I don't.
- We ought to call a doctor, Lucy.
- It's nothing.
I just need to rest a bit.
And besides...
I'm allergic to doctors.
How I know it?
All right ... no doctor.
But I am going to
stay and look after you.
Please Mina, that's not necessary.
You should go to the castle.
No, I insist.
It will be like old times.
But Jonathan, is waiting for you.
I will send him a note.
- Morning.
- Good morning. I was looking for ...
Zoran.
I am Zoran.
The Kisslingers told me you see to making
deliveries to Count Dracula's castle.
If you would be so kind?
- Hello! And who are you?
- My name is Marika.
Miss Lucy gives me piano lessons.
But today she cannot, she doesn't feel well.
Oh, dear ...
Why don't we call a doctor?
Because it is nothing,
What is wrong with all of you?
- No. What is wrong with you.
- Papa please, it is only a touch of fever.
I'm sorry, but I must look.
- Papa!
- I'm sorry Lucy, but I must look!
I must look!
Well then?
May I ask what you looking for?
- How are you feeling?
- Just a bit weak.
Excuse me.
What is happening?
Nothing ...
You know what parents are like.
A chilly case of influenza
completely flusters them.
And you?
Were you able to find Zoran?
Yes.
You'll see,
Jonathan will come to you soon.
It's late,
I must close the door.
He has a very demanding job.
And the Count is a very demanding man.
Yes.
That must be it.
- Good night, Mr. Kisslinger.
- Good night, my dear.
Jonathan, my love,
where are you?
- Stop it!
- Hold still
I'll do it to you too.
Thank you.
What is this?
Oh, that?
Nothing, it's an insect bite.
No, Lucy ...
an insect could not leave such big marks.
It's nothing, really.
Go to the castle.
Don't worry about me.
I feel better.
Go find your husband.
All right then.
- I'll call for the carriage.
- No. Don't.
You know I like riding horseback.
And I will be back
before evening.
With my husband.
Whether the Count likes it or not.
Good for you.
Forgive me, I did not
mean to startle you.
I ...
am Count Dracula.
- My name is Mina Harker.
- Yes
I know who you are.
How did I get here?
I found you lying
unconscious on the path.
- The wolves!
- These forests can be very dangerous.
I also recovered your horse.
I do not know
how to thank you, Count.
Did you see her?
- Yes
- Well? What is she like?
She is very beautiful.
- But you are more beautiful.
- Shut up!
I want to see her.
Unfortunately,
Mr. Harker is not here.
I sent him to the city
to collect some books,
and he will not return for several days.
I am sorry you have come
all the way up here in vain.
Jonathan has told me
so much about you, but ...
I must confess you are ...
even more
beautiful in person.
And I must confess to you
that although I am certain that
I have never seen you before
I have the feeling that
I have already met you.
And you think the meeting was ...
pleasant?
Yes, I think so.
Come on will you Miss.
Don't punish yourself.
The Count will be angry.
I must go.
Wait ...
Stay a while longer.
I really cannot!
Do not insist.
I beg you.
Good morning.
Thank you.
- Father?
- It is Miss Kisslinger ...
Lucy...
- What has happened to Lucy?
- I am so sorry.
My God!
How could it ever happen?
She couldn't breathe.
I called the doctor,
but it was already too late.
I should have called him yesterday.
Instead of listening to her.
Your dress ...
- It's Jonathan.
- Then you managed to see him?
No.  The Count said
he was in the city.
But I do not  ... know why I
I do not remember.
I hardly remember anything
about what happened at the castle.
- Father ...
- My child.
I need to talk to someone.
Ever since I arrived in Passburg,
such strange things have happened.
Lucy's death, all of a sudden,
and my husband, Jonathan,
seems to have vanished into thin air.
And these constant nightmares ...
I dreamed of a wolf
tearing a woman to pieces.
Just like that woman's daughter ...
That is how she died, isn't it?
Perhaps if I could meet
the mother ... talk to her.
- She left the village.
- When?
Two days ago.
No one knows where she went.
Father ...
You know what is
happening, don't you?
Please Father, I must know.
I can't tell you.
I beg you Father, please.
Help me!
No, not I.
But there is only one
person who can help you.
I will tell you. But promise please,
you will do nothing until he arrives.
I promise.
I am the resurrection and the life.
He that believeth in me, though
he were dead yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.
It's about time!
- And the mayor?
- Kisslinger won't come.
And neither would the priest.
We would vote for them.
Is there a problem?
No.
Out with it Janek,
Tell us why we are here?.
It's the Count! We have to do something
about what's happening to our village.
That monster must be stopped!
It killed Tania,
Miss Kisslinger and Jarmila too.
Jarmila left town.
There is no proof that she was killed.
No.
We all know it was Dracula.
- You're all crazy.
- We can't go on like this.
You know you were all fine with it
when Count paid for the schools
or paid off your debts.
You had nothing to object to.
He's gone too far, Holy Christ,
Passburg is is becoming a cemetery!
- And you do nothing!
- We have a pact with him!
Breaking it would be worse.
- And the lives of our children?
- Milos, she was not killed by Dracula.
And as for Tania she shouldn't
have gone out on Walpurgis Night.
And that should be enough for us?
- No, maybe not.
- Then we have to do something!
May I?
- Sir, we ...
- Let's get right to the point Lt. Delbruck
Whom among you
wishes to break our pact?
That is, what this is about...
Is it not?
Well, no one.
You are all cowards!
You were wrong to turn against me.
I am your Master and you merely  ...
a servant ...
who has betrayed me.
Forgive me.
I am sorry I frightened you.
I am Abraham Van Helsing.
You must be Mrs. Harker?
Oh yes, Sir.
Please Sir ...
You must excuse me. His
daughter's death has upset him terribly.
Won't you sit down?
And it was because
of her you asked for me?
Yes.
She suddenly began to feel ill.
And you noticed the
marks behind her knee.
Lucy told me it was an
insect bite, but I don't believe it.
Do you think those
marks would cause Lucy's death?
I cannot tell you anything yet,
but I intend to help
you find out what did.
And what about my husband? I have had no
word from him since he went to the castle.
I will do what I can.
Is there lodging in the village?
Yes, just down the road.
One more thing ...
She was buried today,
is that correct?
Yes, why do you ask?
You should be more careful
with the door. It was opened.
Anyone could have wandered in.
Good night, Mrs. Harker.
- Good night, Sir.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Harker ...
- What are you doing here?
I  am ... working.
What have you done with Lucy's body?
Don't be afraid, it's me.
It's Lucy!
No not possible ...
In the name of God,
return from where you came.
In the name of God,
I command you to go back!
- Is she ...
- Yes
Believe me, you should go.
You do not want to see this.
Come ... come.
Go ....
I think at this point
it is better you know the truth.
The creature that is
responsible Lucy's death
is not human.
It is a vampire.
A vampire?
I discovered this a few years ago
when I was a Director of
the insane asylum in Carfax.
I could not believe it myself at first.
- Who started it?
- I do not know, sir.
- What time?
- Just a few minutes.
- They take their medicine?
- Yes
- Any fighting?
- No more than the usual.
Do we have enough laudanum,
in case we need it?
I think so.
Does God!
As I started my
research , I also discovered
that they do not just kill their victims,
they sometimes transform them.
How?
By sucking their victim's blood
and feeding it back to them.
It gives them extreme power.
You mean ... Lucy ...
The creature you saw at the
cemetery was not your friend anymore.
How can you defeat
a monster like that?
There are ways.
He is waiting in the castle.
- Count Dracula.
- He mesmerises people.
Enters their mind
and takes possession.
This explains why
you remember so little.
Mrs. Harker ...
Are you all right?
Promise me you will not leave
the house for any reason.
Doctor, I ...
I know what I must do.
Don't worry sir,
I will look after her.
Dr. Van Helsing!
Jonathan?
I will bring him back to you.
If he is still human,
he's a very lucky man.
You called for me, my Lord?
Yes.
I will need your
assistance this evening.
He knows I'm here.
What did I see?
Nothing, do not worry.
Father?
My son, what are doing out at this hour?
I am Abraham Van Helsing.
Glad to see you.
I do not know you, sir.
You know me well enough
and what I came to do.
Dracula has kidnapped Mrs. Harker. Will
you help me? There is little time to lose.
I beg you sir.
Go away. I can do nothing for you!
Please!
Sorry to have disturbed you.
You do not know him!
You do not know what he is capable of!
He is evil!
Do you hear me Van Helsing? Evil!
Open up!
Help me, my Lord.
Help me.
Give me the strength, my Lord.
Give me the courage!
Help me, my Lord.
Tania!
Master ...
Tania has not returned ...
She will never return.
Tonight is the anniversary
of the death of my wife.
Dolingen Gratz.
What happened to her?
A sudden illness
tore her away from me
when he was only twenty.
How awful.
You must have suffered so much.
Yes I did.
Van Helsing!
Father!
I've changed my mind.
come.
But ...
There are things much worse than death.
Wait.
First, you must know what I am.
Nosferatu, the undead.
The monster that everyone fears.
- I do not fear you.
- You should.
I have been
snatched from darkness and
sent to earth to
plunder the blood of my people.
The only way I can still
nourish this foul cadaver.
Stop it.
Stop it.
I am nothing, but an ...
out of tune chord in
the divine symphony.
No, my love.
My love.
It's a full moon.
Better to enter by day.
Sunrise,
might be too late.
Don't be afraid ... Father.
Not here.
Not now.
The hour is not yet over.
Come.
Open it.
Let's go!
Van Helsing!
- You still never have ...
- Who might that be?
Tania. My mistress.
She was a monster.
No..
She was an angel.
I am the monster.
"She sought and found death
the 5th day before the ides of May
the year 1476.
For the death travel fast. '
"Dolingen De Gratz"
It is ...
400 years
since Dolingen died.
I buried her here instead of
within the darkness of a Castle
because she loved these woods.
Since the moment I saw you in
the photograph at the mayor's house
I felt only of
bringing you back to me.
- I'm not her.
- Oh yes, my love, you are.
Thanks to Lucy,
you have come back to me.
Lucy.
It was through her
I lured you to Passburg.
And then you killed her.
No.
I gave her what she most desired.
Eternal life.
Did you kill Jonathan?
He was ...
only an obstacle to our love.
We had to meet again ...
Dolingen.
May God forgive me.
- Van Helsing!
- Get away from him.
Kill him ... my love.
The heart, Abraham!.
You have to strike me in the heart!
- I will.
- I will.
Don't do it, please!
Don't do it.
Shoot .. him.
Shoot ...!
Stop!
Alto. Come no closer.
Please ...
Please!
My love ...
Thank God, I had
enough garlic for one bullet.
It was ... as if I was in a trance.
Every word I said,
everything I did ...
It was not me, it was
him who guided me.
You were in his power.
But why?
Why did he force me
to tell him that I loved him,
that I wanted to
spend eternity with him?
It is the power of passion.
But he knew I didn't really mean it.
His passion is this savage fire...
which consumes what he wants most.
Dracula ...
... famous Dracula.
From fire to ashes,
and ashes to dust.
Come.
