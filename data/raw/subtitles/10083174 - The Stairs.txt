Honey, don't forget to
bear those heirloom tomatoes
that Jeb promised
us on your way back,
I want to get those
canned up this week.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
This is not bacon.
You know what Dr. Kilian
said, your bacon days are over.
I'm the only guy
in the entire block
that has a prescription
for oatmeal, soggy oatmeal.
- It's not!
- It is, what kind of berries?
- Hey!
- Perfect timing!
Oh, come give your
grandma some sugar.
Grandma!
- Hey.
- Hi, good morning.
Good morning, really?
That's just what I needed.
You only love
me for my coffee.
- Just wake up?
- No.
Do not let him fool you,
he did not wake up
until we pulled in.
Really? Is that a fact?
Yeah, he slept
the whole way here.
Kiddo, go get your stuff,
help grandpa load up.
Come on, let's go!
Katie girl, will you
come help me finish
packing up their lunches?
I'm guessing you
are done with that.
I'm very done with that, yes.
- It's good for you.
- Thank you.
- You should eat it.
- Oh,
well then it's good for you too.
Come on kiddo, we're
burning daylight!
Where are my binoculars?
Okay, where was I?
Hi mama.
Hi sweetie, how are you?
I am very tired.
I wanted to come last
night but you know,
I needed to pick
up an extra shift.
Single mothers
just work too hard.
I'm glad you're taking a few
days off and to stay with us.
None of that is
for dad, right?
No.
This is Jessie's BLT and
then the rest is for us.
You know, you need
to keep an eye on him.
Oh, you are
preaching to the choir.
Your father though, he
just loves his bacon.
How are things going
at school, any better?
Not really.
The kids just keep
picking on him
and I don't understand why.
And you had the meeting with
the school and everything?
You need your father to
call, you just let us know.
I might take you up on that
but I'm trying to let the
kids figure it out themselves.
Well, we're here for you.
I appreciate that, I know.
You know, Jesse's been so
excited about this trip,
it's all he's been
talking about all week.
Your father been
just the same,
he has been buzzing
off these walls.
That boy just brings
him so much joy.
So he's been
driving you crazy too?
Yes.
Better get this out to him.
You know, he was ready
to leave an hour ago.
Let's get them off.
Okay!
I got you two sandwiches for
you and grandpa for lunch
but there's a BLT in
there for your breakfast.
And I got you one of those
chocolate donuts you like
but don't let your
grandpa get it.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Thank you.
Give me a kiss.
All right, put your belt on.
Grandma!
Hey kiddo.
I want you to listen
to your grandpa
and stay with him
the whole time, okay?
- Okay.
- He's going to be fine.
It's not like it's
the first time
he's ever been hunting, right?
I'll have him home tonight.
- Bye dad.
- Bye daughter.
- Bye wife.
- Bye husband.
Grandpa!
Grandma said no!
Well, grandma's not
here right now, is she?
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that bacon is bad, bad for you?
So I'm actually
doing you a favor.
You're welcome.
All right.
There's a good spot.
Okay.
Said you gotta
go, so go, go, go!
- Don't forget your backpack.
- I won't.
Check this, please.
Okay.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Excellent.
All right, help me with this,
you know I can't reach here.
Come on, jump, jump, jump!
Oh, got it, good job!
You got everything you need?
Yep.
Me too.
All right, you see 'em?
Yup.
Go for that big buck
right off the main herd.
Got 'em.
Just like we trained.
Slow breaths.
And once you are
trained on your target,
exhale, hold it.
And when you're ready
to take the shot,
you take the shot.
Just like you taught me.
You got him!
All right, grab your gear,
we got to start tracking
before we lose the blood trail.
Came right up this deer trail.
Watch yourself.
That was a good shot.
Look at here.
We got blood.
Which way do you think he went?
Left.
Left's good, come on.
Hey, don't lag behind me.
Come on, hurry up.
Oh yeah.
See this leaf?
This leaf has more blood on it.
See there how frothy it is?
Yeah.
It means you got
him in the lung.
Yeah, I think we're right
up on him now sport!
Jess, come on!
Oh, what do we have here now?
You see all this blood?
Yeah.
You see how the
leaves and the dirt
are all kind of disturbed?
That means he either stopped
here on purpose to take a rest
or he fell down.
Either way that's
great news for us.
I want you to keep
your eyeballs peeled
because I guarantee you he's
just up around the corner here.
Collapsed.
Grandpa, did you hear that?
Come on, I won't hurt you.
It's okay, see?
I won't hurt you.
Wait, there's more!
We're right on
top of him now boy
and I'll tell you
what, he is a big one.
Well, hey there big fella.
Jess, come on,
you're gonna miss.
Jess!
Jess!
Champ, you missed the best part!
Hey, where'd you go champ?
Wow!
Jess!
I'm gonna start
calling you donut boy.
Jess!
Where's my favorite grandson?
Jess!
Oh, there you are.
What are you?
Sure as hell thought I
taught you better than that.
Oh.
Jess?
Jess!
I'm sorry grandpa!
No, Jess!
Jess!
Grandpa!
What? No, no, no!
I'm going to piss.
All right, just make it quick
'cause we're already
running late.
Grab that quad breve.
Wait, is that why you
wanted to stop here?
What?
No, I needed to piss.
Just so happens this place
has really great coffee.
Besides, it's going
to be five days
before I can get another latte.
Yeah, just hurry it up
because they're probably
already waiting on us.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hey, welcome to the Espresso
Chalet, what can I get ya?
Can I get a quad breve latte?
What size you need it in?
Large and a large drip no room
and one of these bad boys.
Okay.
Okay, here you go,
that'd be 8.50.
Awesome, keep change.
Thanks, where are
you boys heading?
Oh, we're hiking
into Salta Sack.
We're going to go the back
way off of highway 20.
Salta Sack huh, aint
that like a 30 mile trek?
Yes sir it is.
Wow, it's beautiful out there.
You guys geared up for that?
Yeah, we've got
everything we need.
Well be careful out there,
there's a blood moon tonight.
And you know what that means.
I'm sorry, what
do you mean by that?
People go missing
during a blood moon.
Leave those boys alone.
He likes to spread conspiracies.
They're not conspiracies.
Right.
Okay.
Time to go?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- Have a nice hike.
- Thank you.
Nick, come on man, let's
go, we're already late.
In the truck.
Alright.
Good luck out there.
- You okay man?
- Yeah.
What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm good.
You look quiet.
What the hell was all
that blood man stuff?
I knew it.
Man, you are an easy mark bro.
- What happened?
- You're taking the blame.
- Why me?
- Yeah.
What's up?
You're late but I will
probably forgive you.
Hi, hi, hi!
It's good to see you.
Boys,
this is my girlfriend, Jordan.
Yeah, Jordan, how ya doing?
I only do handshakes.
Oh, all right,
we can do that,
nice to meet you.
Rebecca's told us all about you.
Not everything I hope.
Oh, everything.
Okay, boys let's get the show
on the road, where's Chuck?
Yeah, where the hell is
Chuck? He's never late.
He's only, what, 10 minutes
to the trail head, right?
Yeah.
Is that?
Doug?
Doug, you invited dirty
fucking Doug on this trip?
Who's dirty Doug?
You said you invited
Chuck, what the hell?
Yeah, that's what I'm
trying to tell you guys.
What are you
trying to tell us?
Okay, Chuck
canceled last minute
and Doug was just standing
there at the bar and you know,
one thing led to another
and he took Chuck's place.
Doug invited himself then.
No.
Well, yeah.
Don't give me that look, man,
you know I can't say no to Doug.
Who wants to fuck?
Oh God.
Yeah bro, I'm good.
- I only do handshakes.
- I'm sorry
for all of what's about
to happen because of you.
You parked in two spots,
you parked in two spots, man!
Let's go boys.
I guess 20 miles aint going
to hike themselves, right?
Oh, Uncle Seth
cookie, this is good.
Hey, I'll eat this, you
burn off calories, fat boy.
Oh, this is my nightmare.
Karma's a bitch, huh?
Lock the trunk.
Dick.
Oh, so how long have
you two been doing it?
You're so gross.
Do you mean how long
have we been together?
He's just jealous.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, not about the jealous
part, but the together part.
- You know something Doug?
- What?
You're beginning
to grow on me.
Ah, see?
- The romance begins.
- Swear to God.
Nope.
Hey, hey, how much
longer do we got?
Seriously bro?
Okay, we've been
hiking for five hours.
That's like 10, 12 miles.
We still have another five to go
before we even hit first camp.
First camp?
Come on.
Buddy, we talked about this.
We do the bigger
chunk today, 15 miles.
Tomorrow we do the second half,
13 miles to camp Mananall.
Come on, you got this?
I believe in you.
Come on pussy!
- Doug.
- Fuck you, man.
Fuck you, man.
You guys are so
mean to each other.
Hey man.
All right, let's just take
like a quick little break,
let's all catch our breath, huh?
Sounds good to me man.
Let me help you.
Oh, Jesus.
What do you have in here, rocks?
This thing weighs
like 50 pounds.
Did you not follow
my weight restrictions
and packing guide?
Totally, I just,
I may have added a few extra
items to the list though.
He didn't weigh his pack.
This right here is like
five pounds alone man.
You don't even need that.
All right, let's see
what else is in there.
No, that's
totally unnecessary.
We're totally doing that.
Three?
You brought three
pairs of jeans?
No way.
We're only out for five
days, you know that right?
Who wears jeans to hiking,
let alone brings four pairs
for five days?
Hold on.
Why do I even bother
giving you lists?
Dude, I just got that tent.
- Oh shit!
- What?
You're not going to
believe this cookie boy.
What is it?
What?
Wait, is that?
Is this my knife?
Wow.
Okay, I'll tell you what, this
is what we're going to do.
I'm going to take your pack,
you're going to take mine
but we're leaving
behind this chili,
the three pairs of jeans
and this big ass tent.
We'll share my two man.
Not my chili, I'll carry that.
It's the only thing
I brought to eat.
No, you're going
to take all this shit
and stash it behind a rock
or a tree or something.
We'll get it in a couple of
days on our way back out.
We set out on a 30 mile
hike and you brought 10 pounds
of chili with you?
It's eight pounds
and I love chili.
Dude, I love chili
too but there's no way
I'm going to pack all this.
This is what I'm gonna
do, I'm going to take
four of these cans
from you, all right?
- Thanks Doug.
- Go fuck yourself.
Where's my water?
I don't know, maybe
in the chili pile?
Probably in chili.
Holy shit, come
check this out.
Whoa.
What is this thing?
Looks like some sort of
beavers nest or something.
You idiot, beavers don't
build nests, they build dams.
We're not even close to
the water so that's not it.
This is freaky.
- Let's go.
- Yes please.
I think it's pretty cool.
Last time I was in the
beavers nest, it was your mom.
You eating that cold
right out of the can?
Oh yeah, I love it.
Obviously.
Hey!
Don't eat my chili, man!
Sorry chili boy,
this is my Sherpa tax.
Oh, hey baby,
your shoe is untied.
Oh.
What do you mean tax?
Dude, come on man,
I only brought enough for
me to have two cans a day!
Nope, nope, I'll give
you a can of my strogan,
that way you won't go hungry.
Do you even know
what strogan is?
I actually don't.
Hey!
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca!
Hey, are you
hurt? Are you okay?
I really think we have to go.
Dude, she's freaking out.
Rebecca, what'd you see?
What's going
on? What happened?
- You didn't see the lady?
- What lady?
Rebecca, what are
you talking about?
What do you mean what lady?
She walked right through you!
I didn't see any lady.
Is she hot?
Rebecca, tell us what you saw.
Blood and her feet-
- Nobody walked by us, I
mean, I would have seen that.
We haven't seen anybody
since this morning.
This is ridiculous.
I'm going to see you
guys up on the trail.
Hey, hey, when was the
last time you had water?
I don't want
any fucking water!
I'm trying to tell
you there is a lady
and she's walking,
she's covered in blood
and she was barefoot.
Okay, now I'm getting scared.
Okay, everyone needs
to just calm down.
Hey look, just drink a
little bit of this, all right?
Drink some water.
Here, let me see that.
Okay cool, so we're
all good now, right?
Oh my God, Doug!
Doug!
Here's his shirt.
There's his pack!
This is weird.
Is it his water bottle?
Holy shit.
Doug!
Doug!
Ola bitches!
Fuck.
Why don't you get
in? This is nice.
All right.
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.
Why not?
Oh Jesus, oh shit.
That's why.
Bro.
What?
Dude no, on you.
What the fuck!
Get it off, get it off!
Get it the fuck off me!
- Come on, get em off!
- Who has the lighter?
Who the fuck has a lighter,
why do you need a lighter?
So how are we gonna get
those bastards off then?
Fine, it's in my shorts!
Oh God, oh God.
Stand still.
Yeah, I am!
Oh wait, wait, wait.
Just let me check something.
Look that way.
Yeah I'm good, okay.
Get them off me.
- No!
- Fuck you man.
Fuck you, man.
Okay, so word to the wise,
most of these Alpine
lakes have leeches in them
so check before you jump.
Yeah, great information,
help me please!
God, do it, do it, do it!
How much farther we got
til we break for camp?
Seriously?
- Seriously?
- What?
I got all these slimy
cocksuckers all over me,
you're worried about how
many miles it is to camp?
It's that many.
- But I was just-
- Just,
- just about two miles that way.
- Stand still.
I am!
- I was just trying to-
- I was just trying to.
- Nevermind.
- Yeah, nevermind.
This one's killing me,
this one's killing me,
this one's killing me,
this one's killing me.
Nope, nope, nope.
Get it, get it.
Don't do that.
Into where I needed to go.
Josh, what's up?
I don't know.
He keeps wanting
more and more and more.
I'm gonna do this, okay?
We're going to figure it out.
This can't just keep
happening like this.
Everything pushes away-
- Dude, this guy's tripping out.
He's fucking losing it.
What is he talking about?
I don't know.
Right here okay?
Right here, right here.
I just don't know what to do.
Let me talk to him.
That's what I'm
saying to you, okay?
What're you gonna say?
If you'd want to
hear me, that's fine.
If you don't want
to listen to me,
that's your problem, not mine.
But we have to change because
I've tried to make it work,
I tried to make
it work, I tried.
Yeah.
Yes, I know we have to,
we have to figure out
a way to make it work.
We're going to figure out
a way to make it work.
We're going to make
it work together.
Okay.
We're going to do this.
It's going to finally stop,
it's going to finally stop.
You didn't mean it.
You love her.
We can get through
this, can't we hun?
Is everything okay?
Oh my God, miss?
We can get through
this, can't we hun?
Miss?
We can get through this.
What the shit?
Are you guys lost?
It's okay, it's okay.
She's just hungry, that's all.
Everything is going to be fine.
Miss, show me
where you've hurt.
Just give her time.
Oh fuck man, your head!
Hey, grab the first aid kit,
this dude took a
spill or something.
Oh my God guys, this is bad.
Yes, I know, I know, I know.
I know that it hurts, but
it's best not to upset it.
Hurry up with that kit.
That's her, that's her!
What's she saying,
I can't make it out?
I don't fucking know,
I got my own shit
going on over here!
Oh God, what are
we going to do now?
What are we going to do now?
Everybody is going to know!
Oh my God.
Oh my God please,
God please help me.
Please help me.
We're here to help,
just tell us what to do.
Oh my God, it's a baby.
What the fuck is that man?
What did you do?
No, stop!
Hey buddy.
Take it easy, calm down.
- Calm down.
- What?
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
You shouldn't be in
here, get out of here!
We ain't going nowhere man.
We're all right
here in the woods.
You kids need
to run along now.
This is a family matter!
We're not gonna run
along, we're right here.
- Whoa!
- Hey, okay!
You heard me!
Calm down.
- I said leave!
- Okay, hey look,
- we need to go, now.
- We just wanted to help.
You're not welcome here!
Hey, that's not needed.
Okay, we're leaving, calm down.
Oh God!
I told you to leave.
I told to leave us
alone, leave us alone,
leave us alone,
please leave us alone!
No, no, no!
I told you.
This is a family matter!
Go, go, go!
Shit.
What?
I forgot Nick's pack.
What?
You doing okay?
I want to go home.
Oh man, I can't believe
you left my stuff.
It's a lost cause now
cause ain't no one of us
going to go back
there and get that.
What was that man?
It's the fucking
lady I told you about-
- No, I'm not talking
about the lady,
I'm talking about the thing
that she was holding up
in her hand.
Yeah, that was a baby right?
Like, please tell
me that was a baby.
Oh my God, my heart
is going so fast,
I don't feel so good.
All right look, maybe we
can like skirt around it
and then we can get
down to the mountain
and we could call
someone, right?
It's too late in
the day to go back.
It'll be dark soon.
Do you want to go
back the way we came
and risk bumping into
them in the dark?
No.
No.
You guys.
Let's just set up camp here.
What the fuck is going on?
What happened?
What did you see?
You can tell me.
I knew what I saw, but I want
to know what all of you saw.
Hey, leave her alone,
she's been through enough.
- What?
- Hey, Nick.
Stop!
You're going to be okay,
we're all going to be okay.
But she's right, man.
We got to set up camp and rest.
- Rest?
- Yeah, fucking rest!
Rest, yeah rest.
You think anybody's going
to sleep after that?
This is far from okay man!
We just saw a dude shoot
himself in the face
and it didn't even phase him!
I know.
I mean, what the fuck?
Hey, you need to settle down.
Settle down?
Settle down?
I should settle down!
I'm going to show
you settle down.
I'm going to settle my
ass the fuck out of here
is what I should do, come on!
Whoa, whoa.
Hey.
- Take a breath.
- Nick.
Calm down.
Okay, you're getting
worked up over nothing.
Yeah, nope.
What the fuck did
you just say to me?
What the did he just
say? For nothing?
Yeah.
For nothing!
Hey, hey, just breathe!
This is the most fucked
up shit I have ever seen!
And you all, you all are acting
like seeing a maggot baby
and a man shooting
himself in the head
as a normal fucking
day of hiking!
It's not!
Fuck!
Nick.
Your food was in the pack, man.
It's all right,
it's all right,
you can have one
of my stroges bro.
Plus, I got these
bad boys right here.
Really Doug?
Are you stupid?
No, you're not getting high!
Okay?
I don't need you tripping balls
in the middle of the woods
singing kumbaya on the
fucking campfire, you idiot!
Okay mom.
What am I going
to sleep in, man?
It's okay.
Hey, you can share
your bed with me.
Thanks.
Actually, I'm good.
I got my space blanket, man.
You can take the bag.
We're in the two man.
We'll be fine.
All right, we're going
to get some firewood.
You want to come with me?
All right, I'll be back.
Be safe.
We're going to set up
camp, just take it easy.
You gonna be all
right? Just breathe.
Would anybody care for some tea?
Nope and you've
probably had enough.
It's a microdose but
I think I'm okay dad.
Sure, I'll have some.
Yeah?
Sure you want to do that?
It's okay, that
will help me relax.
- Thanks.
- Anybody else?
Last call.
No.
Well, more for me.
More for us.
At least somebody
can sleep through this.
Guys actually, I'm kind of done.
You want to come?
Yeah, in a bit, I'm going
to finish this tea first.
- Goodnight y'all.
- Goodnight.
Hey, you should get some rest.
No, I can't sleep.
I'll stay up, keep
the fire going.
Well, I'm going to bed.
- Hey!
- Hey.
Give him a break in a sec
so he can get some rest, okay?
Yes ma'am.
- All right, goodnight guys.
- Goodnight darling.
Won't you go rest up bubba?
No, I'm good for a bit longer.
Besides, sleeping beauty
back there is in my bag so.
All right, well,
how about this?
In a little bit I'll
change your place,
so I'll tend the fire and
you can go sleep in my tent,
sleep in my sleeping back, huh?
How about that?
I'm going to go lay down
and trip some fucking balls
'cause there's no way in
hell I could sleep right now.
- Sounds good.
- All right, deal.
Deal.
Come with me my love.
What the?
Did you guys hear that?
What was that?
It kind of sounded like Doug
but he's still in
there sleeping.
Doug?
Doug?
He's not in there.
What do you mean
he's not in there?
Look, he was really high man,
he might've went off and
wandered into the woods.
Look at these markings.
It's like he dragged his
sleeping bag in that direction.
Why would he do that?
Because he had way too many
mushrooms and he's an idiot?
Didn't bring his headlamp?
Maybe we should
go look for him.
No way, we're safer
here by the fire.
What do you think Nick?
I don't think
we have a choice.
I think we got to go him.
Throw me his lamp.
Come on.
Doug?
Fuck.
Doug?
Doug!
Y'all.
What, what is it?
It's Doug's shoe, he
has to be around here.
Doug!
Here, let me see that.
Man, it's definitely
his, what a fucking idiot!
He has to be close.
Doug!
What's that?
The trail just goes cold.
See how are all these ferns
are smashed up to this point
and then, nothing.
It's like he just disappeared.
Man, he didn't disappear.
He's gotta to be
around here somewhere,
so let's just split up.
Look for signs.
I'll go this way.
Doug!
Guys?
I found his sleeping bag.
What does this mean?
I don't know but that's blood
so he's clearly hurt.
Where are you man?
Looks like
something got to him.
What do you mean something?
Be specific, like an animal?
I don't know Nick, but
it doesn't look good.
Shut up!
I swear to God from here if
we go south, there's a road
and if we go
northeast on the road,
there's a ranger station.
Why are you talking
about a ranger station?
We have to find Doug!
Would've been a lot easier
if you hadn't lost the map!
Lost the map?
The map that is
back at the campfire
where I said we were safe?
Map, that map?
You could be taking
further to the woods-
- Look!
There's a light.
That's gotta be Doug, right?
We gotta find out.
That just sounds
stupid to me but fuck.
Doug!
Whoa.
What the?
What is powering that?
That's a very good question.
Josh, any ideas?
No.
Josh.
Josh, this just
doesn't feel right,
none of this makes sense.
Josh, come down, please!
Dude, this is crazy!
I mean we're like
deep in the cascades.
What, like 50 miles from
another human being?
Who do you think built these?
Or better yet, how did they
get the materials out here?
Okay, this gives me
the heebie-jeebies.
What are you, scared of
some stairs in the woods?
It's not exactly the
stairs that are scary.
It's that they're in the
middle of the woods with power.
Yeah it's like, the lights
are on when no one's home, huh?
You're hysterical,
could you please come down
so we could go find Doug?
Josh, listen to me.
I just, I have a bad feeling
about this, all right?
We need to go and
find Doug, please.
Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry.
But I will tell you,
nobody's going to
believe us about this.
I'm okay with that, let's go!
I mean, there's not
even like a pine needle
or a leaf or a speck
of dust, it's crazy.
Thank you.
- Grandpa!
- Jess!
Guys!
There's a door back here!
Leave at Josh,
we got to go find Doug.
There's somebody in here!
Is it Doug?
I mean, it's gotta be Doug.
What are you doing?
All right, step back.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
All right, I'm
coming bro, hold on.
Okay.
Oh shit.
What the hell?
Hey, is he okay?
Is Doug down there?
It's pretty dark to tell.
Looks like it goes
way back though.
All right, let's go.
Let's get you up, come on.
Come on.
That's it, come on.
Come on.
- You sure.
- Yup.
Did you hear that?
What is it?
I don't know,
we heard a voice.
It's gotta be Doug.
All right, we got to go find
him, we can't leave him here.
We'll be right back.
Ready?
Yeah.
Doug?
Doug?
Doug?
Sorry.
Is it safe?
Jesus, it's a fucking kid.
Grandpa Jean?
What? No kid.
Who are you?
Where's grandpa Jean?
I don't know kid but we're
the only people down here.
But he was just here.
He found us.
What, who?
Who, your grandpa Jean?
No, the bad man.
Wait, hey kid!
Kid!
Whoa, whoa.
What is this place?
No idea.
The fuck is that?
I don't know.
Let's just find the kid
and get out of here.
Kid.
Kid, hey, hey.
The fuck is that?
It's one of the hunters.
What do you mean hunters?
Nick, get over here, stop.
He's close, do you
know where the door is?
Wait, what?
It always changes the door,
it's never in the same spot.
What do you mean it changes?
We literally just
came through the door.
- You did?
- Yeah.
- Can you take me there?
- Yes, come on.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's go.
Go, go, go.
Hey, wait, wait.
Are you sure it's that way?
I think we came from that way.
No, we passed that tank.
The tank, there's a
hundred of those tanks.
Trust me.
I'm gonna go.
This way.
Hey kid, what's wrong?
What are you doing?
Holy shit!
Come on! Come on!
Take the kid!
Who's that?
It doesn't matter,
just take him!
What are you doing? Come on!
I don't hear it.
I think we lost it.
Oh my God, Josh!
Fuck!
Oh shit!
Where's Josh?
He's gone.
Josh is gone.
Okay, look at me.
- Stop, we have to leave.
- No.
We're getting out of
these fucking woods and go!
No guys stop, wait!
He's behind us.
You guys stay here, I'm
going to go get him.
No! We're coming with you.
Turn your light off, the moon
is out, we can see just fine.
Don't want that thing
to see where we are.
What the?
Nick.
What the fuck? What happened?
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah.
I just fell on some
sort of mud puddle.
Oh God, that's not mud,
what the hell is that smell?
I don't know.
Something died,
bones everywhere.
I want to go home.
Let's find that road.
Yeah, it's back that way.
It's not just Doug.
What?
There are other people here.
I'm sorry man.
Run!
Run!
Oh God!
It's coming, hurry!
Go, go!
Which way?
Over there!
Run!
Let's go to the other side!
This is locked too!
Come on!
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca hurry!
Rebecca, come on!
No!
Do you see it?
Jordan, do you see it?
No.
Oh God, oh God!
He won't leave.
They never do.
It's always hungry, it
has to feed its kids.
Kids?
Yes.
And they always cry and
cry in the darkness,
always hungry, always searching.
Everything in the
darkness is hunting.
To survive, you
have to keep moving.
How did you survive
all this time?
Get the car!
Josh was a notorious
prankster when we grew up.
He always found ways to
mess with me and my friends.
He would scare us all the time.
And as I got older,
I learned to stand up to him
and I would retaliate.
And of course, Josh,
he would always
have to one up me,
but he was my brother.
He was always there for me.
I'm sure you can imagine
but I was picked on as a kid
and when I got picked on,
Josh, he was there
to settle the score.
He would help me with my tests
and always made sure we
had dinner on the table
because our parents worked
two jobs just to pay rent.
And Josh, he just took that
role and then in college.
For all of his faults,
he was still my brother.
And he loved me.
And now I can't,
I can't repay him.
I just left him there die!
To die by that thing!
- We did everything we could.
- Oh, I don't know.
Everything happened so fast.
All we could do is run
or that thing would
have killed us all.
You did the right thing Nick.
You did the right thing.
You can repay him by
getting us out of here.
Yeah.
Hey, I just realized we
don't know your name kid.
Jesse.
Jesse?
Yeah?
You said your
grandpa's name was Jean?
Yeah, grandpa Jean.
What is it Nick?
Jesse,
is your last name Martin?
Yeah, grandpa Jean
says it was Scottish.
I know this kid, but
that can't be, that was-
- What are you
talking about Nick?
Jesse, did you have a
friend in school named
Nicholas?
Yeah, Nicholas Reed.
We're both in Mr.
Jenson's class.
He lived two blocks down,
he came over all the time.
Oh my God.
What is it?
That's me.
I'm Nicholas Reed.
Nicholas?
Oh my God.
No.
This can't-
- What are you talking about?
Okay, so when I
was in grade school,
there was a kid in my
class who went missing.
Everyone blamed his
grandfather for losing him
but when neither one
of them returned,
headlines went to foul play.
My friend,
Jessie Martin
and his grandfather were
never heard from again.
Wait a minute.
Okay, you're saying Jesse
went missing in the nineties?
Yeah.
He hasn't aged a day in
the past 20 some odd years?
Like he time traveled?
No.
How is this even possible?
It's not possible
and there's no way
that he could time travel
but when I went
inside those stairs,
it's like I was
transported somewhere else.
It's like I was brought
to a different dimension
and I know that that
sounds really weird saying
but I don't know.
There are many
openings in the darkness.
We never went towards them
because of all the things
that hunted down there.
We?
Who else was down
there with you?
Grandpa Jean.
Then I lost him and the
grub daddies almost got me.
So I had to get
through the opening
and that's when you
guys pulled me out.
You said grub daddies?
Yeah.
There's more than one?
Yeah, that's what I call them.
They looked like the little bugs
that grandma complained always
about eating in her garden.
What? I don't hear anything.
Exactly.
I think it left.
It never leaves once
it gets the scent.
It's what grandpa Jean said.
Hey, I think maybe
we should check.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
Windows right there,
you can be my guest.
- Please.
- Fuck that.
Are you insane?
There's no fucking way I'm
ever going to fucking go there.
- Language.
- Sorry kid.
All right, fine.
Let's do this together,
I'll back you up.
What are you doing?
I'm looking for anything
we can use as a weapon.
We can't hide in here forever,
that thing knows we're in here
and it's just waiting
for us to slip up!
Here, you can use this.
My grandpa gave her
to me for my birthday.
Why don't you hold
onto that one kid?
I'm looking for something
a little bit bigger.
Jordan, check the front.
Check the front!
Oh, this is a good sign.
Yes, are there any bullets?
Bingo.
Four shelves.
It's not going to be enough.
It's better than nothing.
He can hear us.
He can smell real good too.
I've got an idea.
Jordan, I need you and
Jesse to make some noise.
Just to distract long enough
for me to open up the side door.
Are you sure about this?
No.
But we need to try something.
Anything.
- You're with me?
- Yes.
- You good?
- Yes.
Peel on back, side wall.
On my cue.
Go.
Okay, it worked, all right.
It looks like we only have
one more shot at this.
All right, listen up.
While Jesse distracts
the creature.
- Grub daddy.
- Grub daddy.
Yes, while Jesse
distracts the grub daddy,
this time, Jordan,
I need you to come out with me
with the shotgun and I
need you to shoot it.
I'd love to.
You gotta make sure
you have a clear shot
'cause we only have
those four shelves.
I've got this.
You're good?
Yeah.
All right.
Go.
Wait for it.
Fuck, safety.
Jordan.
Jordan!
Jordan no!
Somebody help me!
Please!
This could work,
this is gonna work.
Kid, once I go out there
I need you to come
and lock this door.
If it gets me,
stay here until you're
certain it's gone.
Okay Nick.
Over here you son of a bitch!
Goddam it!
Who's the daddy now, bitch?
Can we go home now?
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
Yes.
Yeah, he's here.
I will.
Yes sir.
Yeah, we'll be here.
Okay.
The mother and grandmother
are on their way.
That's so weird.
I must have looked at that
file photo a hundred times
and that's definitely the kid.
I mean, that's him, isn't it?
Yeah, that's him.
Everyone in town knows about it.
How long ago was that?
20 years.
How's that hot
chocolate, any good?
I guess.
Needs more marshmallows though.
So did you get up there?
Oh, we got up there all right.
It ain't good.
Looks like some animal tore
through those kids up there.
- You found the brother?
- No, sir.
Oh ma'am, sorry.
No trace of the brother
means we have to question
the survivors more.
Hey.
You want me to come
fishing with me sometime?
That would be fun.
Sure.
So I take it you didn't
find any stairs and monsters?
Yeah, no stairs, no
monsters, crop circles,
alien aircraft.
Although it did smell
a little squatchy.
Now, what we did find
was a big ash pile.
Definitely some
smoking going on.
It could have been a
bonfire, I'm just saying.
Pretty sure drugs were involved.
I know someone was tripping.
Why?
Did you find anything
to support your claim?
Drugs, paraphernalia?
No, no, I did not
find a bag of mushrooms.
No indeed.
I didn't mention
a bag of mushrooms.
Oh, you know,
I just remembered
- I left something in my car.
- What?
It just dawned on me.
Here, could you hold it?
I'll just be a sec.
The fuck?
This is my brother's knife.
Want you to have it.
Are you sure?
It's your brother's.
Yeah.
Jesse?
Jesse!
Jesse?
Mom?
Mom?
Jesse.
Jesse.
Jesse?
Mom?
- Hey baby, it's me.
- Mom!
I missed you so much!
Jesse.
Grandma?
My boy.
Grandma, I'm sorry.
I lost grandpa.
I couldn't find
him, it was dark.
It's not your fault, okay?
Grandpa's sorry he
forgot the tomatoes.
Mom.
Hey Nick.
We're going to have to ask
you some more questions.
Yeah, can you just
give me one second?
I'm afraid I must insist.
Come on.
Hey Nick?
Yeah buddy.
Thanks for taking me fishing.
Anytime little man.
Anytime.
What you using as bait?
Grubs.
