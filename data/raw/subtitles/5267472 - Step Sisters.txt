Zeta Rho Nu's up next.
Zeta Rho Nu, take to the stage.
Damn, girl!
Looked like a sniper hit you.
- Oh, God. That was so embarrassing.
- I'm a Theta now.
- I don't care what people think.
- Exactly. You're a Theta now.
Start caring.
Jamilah! Oh! What's up, girl?
- Worlds mixing, head spinning.
- I know, right?
Oh, Beth, this is... This is Aisha.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And Cheryl, one of our neos.
Neo is short for "neophyte."
It means she just crossed.
Ooh, crossed what?
Crossed the burning sands.
Oh!
So, you're like a Theta for real now.
Like for real, for real.
Mazel tov, neo. That show was...
Fine for exhibition.
They've got to step it up for competition.
We will. Alright, look,
I've got to say hi to somebody, OK?
What?
I do not choreograph all that dopeness
so heifers can perform it mediocrely.
What's Theta's motto?
"Perfection over excellence,
sister over self."
- Exactly.
- I get it.
But let a sister have her moment.
Don't be a Theta-hater. OK?
My house would have been a murder scene
if our sorority tried to work
together like that.
Yeah, well, Thetas,
we don't F around with stepping.
No, you don't.
Stepping is like African dance
meets hip-hop...
Three words.
Stomp the Yard.
You think I'd miss a movie
with a bunch of shirtless black men
and Chris Brown getting shot?
How do you two know each other?
I was Beth's TA.
Ouch!
Or friend.
TAs don't bail you out of jail
after a fake ID bust.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go holler at a brother or two.
Bye!
Bye.
Damn, girl.
Your man cooks dinner for you,
and you're going to Harvard Law together?
I need to get on your life track.
Dane got into Harvard early.
My application is in. I just need
to get my parents' recommendation.
It's just a formality.
I'll definitely get in. I'm a legacy.
And, well...
I'm me.
Girl, bye.
♪ Oh, oh, Zeta Nu, oh, oh ♪
Yoo-hoo!
Is that the ebony to my ivory?
You know it is.
- Hey.
- Ooh, what are you making?
Something special.
Why don't you let it simmer

- Babe...
- Sexy, dirty, big...
Mom! Dad!
Hey.
Isn't this a great surprise?
Like Pearl Harbor.
So, who died?
You guys only surprise me with bad news.
You did it
with the last two dead relatives.
If I do say so myself, I put my
whole entire foot up in this gumbo.
Dane, we love you
like a rescue puppy.
You do realize that
you're Mayflower white, right?
- Country-club-brochure white?
- Yes.
I hate that I'm lumped in with my brutal,
imperialist, plutocratic white brethren
who have committed every modern atrocity
on a macro-systemic level.
We know. You're an African American
Studies and Poli-Sci major.
All great prep for Harvard.
God, I can't wait.
Matching law degrees.
We're gonna change the world.
Aw. Reminds me of when
we were at Harvard.
We all wanted to change the world.
And it is a shame that the one of us
that has the power to do it...
Here we go.
...is a sinewy, self-aggrandizing ham.
Yvonne had a little rivalry
with a certain former first lady.
Mom, seriously...
Who has beef with Michelle Obama?
That heifer...
That heifer stole my internship.
If you were more driven,
you would understand
just how devastating that is.
Who needs drive when I inherited
your natural brilliance, Mom.
And thighs.
- Enough.
- Take the good with the bad.
Oh, I deserve credit
for not mentioning that.
She adorns the walls with paintings
by mental patients.
Yvonne!
I'll tell that to the 12-year-olds from
the community center who painted them,
Mother.
You...
I deserve credit. My grades are tight.
I was chapter president of our sorority.
I love it here at Westcott.
I'm doing fine.
Harvard will not be possible
with transcripts that are just "fine."
I'm a legacy. Hello!
That's like automatic admission.
Jamilah, we came here today to tell you
that we will not be giving you
our legacy endorsement for Harvard.
We had an agreement.
If you earned a 4.0 GPA,
we would give you
the letter of recommendation.
Dad!
Sorry, I have to live with her.
It's more important
that you build your own legacy,
not inherit ours.
Sweetheart,
we don't want to give you a fish.
We want to teach you to fish.
Speaking of fish,
the halibut in this gumbo is on fleek!
What is fleek?
Bishop!
What's up, player?
You're a little jumpy this morning.
Just...
hadn't had my coffee yet, but...
Dean Berman?
You're a Harvard alum, right?
Yep. They gave me a great education
and a husband.
Nick was a studly, closeted lacrosse star.
He'd sneak into my room,
and with the passion of ten sailors...
Such a good story. It reminds me of
when we talked about the boundaries.
Boundaries. Right, right.
You know what?
Harvard is my top choice for law school.
I could actually really use
an alumni recommendation.
Aren't your parents alums?
Um...
Yes. But "legacy" -
that's just a fancy word for nepotism.

I just made that up.

This is Libby.
And believe it or not, the whole

Oh, Beth!
Libby, this is my friend Jamilah.
So nice to meet you. You all want to play?
Oh, no. I'm from Philly.
We don't play with our drinks.

brothers know their way around a shlong.
I wanted to bite off her nipple
and spit it at her!
Hi, Danielle.
This is my friend Jamilah.
And this is her first SBB party.
Then where is her goddamn beer?
Be a better hostess, Beth.
Oh, no. I don't really do beer.
Weird.
So, interested in rushing SBB?
Actually, I'm a Theta.
- Not heard of it. I'm sure it's great.
- It's a black sorority.
OMG.
They are so mysterious!
Do they really beat you until you pass out
and brand you like cattle
with a hot coat hanger?
I saw it on 20/20.
Maybe it was The View.
Whatever! It was totally Babs.
Do you line up in bikinis and circle
each other's cellulite with a marker?
Used to.
Ah, the good old days!
How come none of your sororities
have houses?
Why don't you participate in Greek Week?
Oh! We have a black girl in ours.
- Do you have a white girl?
- Oh, my God.
- Are you the ones who do the screeching?
- Danielle!
Beth, sweetie.
That ensemble:
five years and ten pounds ago, maybe.
That's a hard "maybe".
So, that beer. Do you have Heineken?
No, skip that. Do you have crack?
Jamilah?
I'm deactivating.
What?
You can just quit your sorority?
Black Greeks are like gangs.
You get out when you die.
Damn.
My point is...
weak people quit.
- I'm not weak.
- Why are you quitting?
I have tried!
But all these girls care about is
blow-drying their hair,
and getting skinny and getting wasted...
But there's sex.
That's true.
SBB has helped me get mad laid.
No! I mean there's sex happening
right in front of me.
This is just like summer camp!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no, no!
Bad Libby!
Oh, oh, oh. Hey, Libby!
- Get up, Libby!
- Beth, please go away.
- You're making it awkward, and I like you.
- Oh, my...
Stop it! I'm trying... to help you!
- Bishop!
- God.
- This has got to stop.
- Are you hung over?
No.
Well, wring out your liver, Bishop.
We have got a big problem.
There is a video online
of a Sigma Beta Beta member
having sex on their lawn!
They're making porn on...
Get down, Libby!
They're making porn on my campus.
It's gone viral.
Poor choice of words.
If they can't get their shit together,
I am pulling their charter!
Yeah...
Terrible.
Goodness!
Get down!
Am I supposed to say something else?
That you're gonna help fix this!
You understand Greek culture.
Oh, no. I understand black Greek culture.
Look, you make this SBB mess go away,
and I'll guarantee you
admission to Harvard.
- Nick and I will both endorse you.
- Oh, OK...
We want to create a distraction,
make SBB look like positive contributors
to the community.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
What if they did that steppy thing?
- Steppy thing?
- You know...
That's Voguing.
Please stop. Please...
Don't you have a competition coming up?
You have that charity step deal.
Yes, but I can't teach them.
- My black card would get revoked.
- Do you want to go to Harvard or not?
Frigging amateurs. When I have sex
outdoors, what I like to do is...
- Boundaries, boundaries!
- Sorry.
Boundaries.
I cannot believe
you're not stepping with us this year.
- I'm mad at you. You're killing me, OK?
- I've been spending all my time on Theta.
- I have to focus on getting into Harvard.
- Alright.
You are a dope choreographer.
You don't need me.
You're right. You're right.
I am seriously dope.
Thanks.
Hey, did you guys hear about that sorority
that had sex on their lawn?
Oh, yeah! Somebody Tweeted,
"S-B-B stands for Skanky Bougie Broads."
It was me.
Of course it was!
Dean Berman is trying
to rehabilitate their image,
get them to do something outstanding.
You mean get through a sentence
without the word "like"?
I mean like having them step.
Wait. White people, stepping?
- I know.
- That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard.
The dumbest. It's so stupid.
Stepping is a black Greek thing.
Uh-huh.
I will say, though, that we did get
our letters and organizational structure
from white fraternities and sororities.
What's wrong with sharing
one part of our culture with them?
Helping white Greeks jack our traditions
is a slap in the face to our founders.
- Hmm.
- No, worse.
A slap in the face, then a headlock,
and a weave yank.
And that isn't cute.
So, just to be clear, you're not on board?
Not even close.
Right.
Can you imagine, all those little Beckys
trying to get the beat?
They're trying...
Girl, you're crazy.
Dean Berman.
Idiot.
Ladies, this probation is preposterous.
We are not going to take this lying down,
like a pillow princess.
Our redemption begins at tonight's social
with Zeta Pi.
- I still like "Date-a-Bi" better.
- You would, fruit fly.
Be aggressively delightful tonight!
Have sunshine shooting out
of your hooters.
You must all be sunshine hooter shooters.
Hello. Middle of a meeting...
Sorry. OK, you all remember Jamilah.
She works for Dean Berman
in Student Affairs.
She wants to talk to us
about our suspension.
Please, enlighten us.
So, I think I have a way to save
your charter and get you reinstated.
You would compete in a charity step show.
It would show the Dean
that you are capable of teamwork,
community service,
cultural awareness
and you would get great press.
That could be really fun!
I'm an excellent country line dancer.
That surprises no one.
Thanks, but no thanks.
We're sorority girls, not showgirls.
Actually, you'd be legends -
the first white Greeks ever to step.
Uh...
We're not all white Greeks.
Right.
Thank you.
Stepping requires
an extraordinary amount of discipline.
And to make it easier,
mentally and physically,
we don't drink during the week.
Jesus Christ. Calm down.
I'm sorry, but Margarita Mondays
at Borracho's - that's an SBB tradition.
Turnt Up Tuesdays at Fleck's? Hello?
And if you think we're missing
Wine-down Wednesdays at Bedspins,
you can lick my...
I think we've heard enough.
SBBs, we're out.
No, no.
Beth.
The Dean is making an example of us.
SBB has become a beacon
of powerful, sexy bitches
that every guy wants to be with
and every girl wants to lose 30 pounds
and be like.
We are highly respected on Greek row.
That's all that matters.
Hey, SBB. There's a ficus in the corner.
Start screwing.
Oh, where's Tyler?
He's gonna get some!
- I thought Devin nailed her!
- I think they both hit it!
SBB, STD!
Did you order food?
No. I just ate.
OK.
Ugh.
Nice digs.
Well, look who has their own slice
of Wonder bread.
Pumpernickel.
Hmm.
Can I help you with something?
Step show. We're in.
Great.
SBB tomorrow, 9:00.
Can't wait.
Seriously, a Snuggie?
I'm sorry. Did I... Did I hear that right?
You're teaching a white sorority to step?
Dean Berman is forcing me.
Look, there are better ways to impress
Harvard than playing Debbie Allen.
Oh, well, thanks for having my back,
just like you did with my parents.
They had a point.
You don't aim high enough.
Your ancestors fought
for your access to education.
- Honor their struggle.
- Struggle?
You should honor my struggle
not to slap you.
Snuggle me!
It is 9:17 p.m., ladies.
You are late to an event taking place
literally a hundred feet
from your bedroom.
Get your flat asses in gear!
Go, go, go!
My ass is perfectly shaped for my frame!
Line up in two rows.
Do we have to do this in the basement?
It is really creepy down here.
Says the girl who does it in the bushes.
Stepping makes a lot of noise.
If we do this upstairs, your neighbors
will burn this place to the ground.
Where's Amber?
Does she get a demerit, Drill Sargent?
You know,
when I was president of my sorority,
I led by example.
Maybe if you tried that,
your charter wouldn't be in danger.
Ooh!
OK. Now that we're all here...
What makes a great step team?
- Oh! Big-ass feet.
- Jesus.
Clever.
- But no.
- Oh.
- Unity.
- Unity! I was going to guess that.
In order to create the beat,
everyone has to be in sync.
Like our periods.
The audience spots mistakes
and weak links immediately,
and then you are done.
You have to think of yourselves
as limbs of the same body.
Sounds really corporate retreat-y.
Are we gonna do trust falls next?
Do not talk while I am talking.
I'll extend you the same courtesy.
It's like mutual respect.
OK?
OK. Let's back it up a little bit.
Let me see you guys dance.
We are here to step.
That's different to dance.
You're right.
But I've got to see what I'm working with.

we're gonna do some stepping.
I'm gonna teach you an eight-count.
Watch my hands, watch my feet,
and really listen to the rhythm.
OK. Now, slow...
Now you try it.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Stomp, clap, slap.
Stomp, clap.
Bend your knees.
OK, just stop! This is so childish.
This is going to impress no one.
Danielle...
try the step alone.
My pleasure.
Oh, my God.
Is she crazy?
Something like that?
Let's call it a night, ladies.
Practice this on your own.
Same time tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
I totally only drink things
with "skinny" in the title.
Like my handy work?
I built this so you can grab a bottle
from anywhere,
and the rest will redistribute
without breaking.
Are you a... Are you a new pledge, or...?
Oh, hell, no.
You'd have to pay me, like, 12
Scrooge McDuck gold vaults to pledge SBB,
especially with Darth Hater as president.
Wow. Duck Tales and a Star Wars
reference in one sentence.
What's your name, not pledge?
Jamilah.
Jamilah.
That's Arabic for "beautiful" or "lovely."
I'm a former Arabic Studies minor.
I wanted to open a ski resort
in Afghanistan.
What could go wrong there?
Kevin.
So, you just hang out
in sorority houses, Kevin?
It's pretty creepy.
"Darth Hater" is my sister.
Danielle?
Nipple. Ass! Bitch. Christ. Crack.
Hooters. Spit it at her!
Danielle?
- Sorry. Her?
- Yeah.
- So, you're adopted?
- Yeah.
Sorry I'm late, Kev.
Somebody ran practice late.
So, like 20 minutes.
My brother makes very bad decisions
when it comes to relationships.
I like to counsel him
because I'm an amazing sister
and an excellent leader.
I'll be right back.
- You...
- Easy. Easy.
- She touched your hair.
- Yes, Sharpton. Sharpton!
We used to bathe together as kids.
She gets a pass.
Good luck with that.
Thanks for the drink.
Yep.
Well, I'm around if you need anything!
So, I realized you guys are missing
some of the basic cultural building blocks
for stepping,
plus Danielle thinks this is childish.
And that gave me an idea.
This is Deja. This is Alani.
They're from 40th Street,
where my sorority volunteers every week.
Why would you be doing community service

Much to his dismay, yes.

Your hypocrisy bores me.
Hey! I feel you. I'm a suburban girl, too.
I'm just saying, you need that.

Um...
Amber, you just sat down.
You cannot possibly be asleep!
Sorry! It's $20.

I am the only one trying to fix this.
You are all sitting on your tits!
If any more SBB business
falls through the cracks,
I am pulling the plug
on this entire step show.
Threats?
That's bold leadership.
Um, don't talk when I'm talking,
and I'll do the same.
It's called, like, mutual respect.
Is that supposed to be me?
Moving on, we are completely behind
on our community service
slash fund-raising
slash SBB bonding night.
Speaking of which, if Her Majesty
would cede me the floor, I have business.
Thank you. Beth and I have been doing
some shopping for props and costumes.
All in, we're looking at three grand.
How much is in
your special events account?
We don't have an account.
Every month, we make a video
for Libby's daddy, asking him for money.
He wires it,
and then we all go out for a fancy dinner.
Oh, and then we give the doggie bags
to the homeless people.
That part was my idea.
So sweet.
Very smart.
- Really fulfilling.
- Good idea.
That's your fund-raising?
- Community service and chapter bonding?
- Yeah.
Ladies, trust me. Raising money yourselves
is a lot more rewarding.
It can even be fun,
like a karaoke night or something.
Oh!
I love to sing.
And I'll organize
a real community service project.
No...
Guys, there is no better feeling
than helping people who need it.
- It will be great.
- Downer!
You are like

By the way, can we talk
about our rehearsal space?
Stomping on concrete...
Should I send you my chiropractor bills?
Yes, and it's killing our pedis.
- And our knees.
- Uh-huh.
That's what's killing your knees?
You need to get that black widow
out of your box, missy!
- Or else, what?
- I'll get it out for you!
Ooh!
Hey!
I'll see what I can do
about the rehearsal space.
In the meantime,
can you guys go five minutes
without being dicks to each other?
We can try.
I'm so glad I stopped by.
Well, I'd like to spread the butter,

Bitch! Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ladies!
Ladies!
Oh...
Apt metaphor.
What?
I just mean, the girls are getting better,
but if they can't work together,
we're screwed.
Hey, girl.
Oh, hi.
I'm headed to the Pilates class
that you prepaid for but keep missing.
Oh, yeah. I know.
I've been so "incognegro" lately.
- I've just been running more.
- Girl, I don't do running.
I mean, I will do side bends or sit-ups,
but I will not lose my butt.
Oh, hey, Betsy.
Hey... Beth.
Right.
Aren't you in SBB?
Yeah. Don't hold it against me.
So, how's the theft? Oh...
I mean, cultural appropriation...
I mean, stepping, coming?
Well, I mean, it started pretty rough,
because it's hard.
- You know?
- Yeah.
But we have a pretty sick-ass coach, so...
You're not teaching them are you, Jam?
Girl, you're crazy.
Teaching?
Oh, we're... I'm busy, you know.
- OK.
- Cardio, Harvard...
I mean, I'm surprised
they find time to practice,
with all the tanning sessions
and blow-drying...
Girl, when was the last time you
left the house without your edges laid?
Cheryl? No. I didn't send for you.
- It's the wrong time...
- We should run.
Because we don't want our FitBits
judging us tonight.
Because we want to be more like... OK.
Ooh! Oh no, girl. You're mad sweaty.
You know I don't do sweat.
- I glow.
- I forgot.
- You're right. OK, girl. Bye! See you!
- See you.
- You're about to get that shit again.
- Bye!
I don't know what's going on with her.
Out of control.
If my sorors find out I'm teaching you
to step, it will get ugly,
like Love and Hip Hop reunion show ugly.
- I like Love and Hip Hop reunion shows.
- I know.
What do you have,
an exam on that comic book?
I didn't know you liked zombies.
Campus is all abuzz about
these white girls stepping next week.
- Are they excited?
- Depends on the skin tone.
Seems to be a direct correlation
between pigmentation and indignation.
Great. So, my college legacy will be...
Auntie Tom, the sell-out house Negress.
Let's postpone your pity party.
OK, my sister tells me you guys
are doing a karaoke fund-raiser?
- Yeah.
- Karaoke's way more fun with a live band.
And I happen to play keyboard in...
So, your legacy will be...
the keyboard playing, Arabic studying,
snowboarding handyman?
- Honey, you're a mess.
- Or a Renaissance man.
I'll just...
I'm gonna get back to work, so...
Let me take you out.
Like a date.
I'm not, you know,
a dinner-date kind of guy.
I'm more original with my game.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
I just think it's probably too soon
for a ski weekend in Afghanistan, so...
The whole playing-hard-to-get thing
really works well for you.
You've got a lot of balls.
Nah.
Just two.
So corny.
Ugh. There you go.
That word again.
Look, make a list of everything
that's not corny,
so I can be cooler in the future.
Oh, you've got it. What's your e-mail?
Uh, twobigballs@forreal.com.
- Twomicro...
- Massive...
- ...balls@inyourdreams.com.
- Inreality.com.

is no way to honor his memory.
You missed my rendition of

would be a gross understatement.

Please report to the stage.
Jamilah.

Hey. Quick second.
Stay away from my brother.
He falls really hard and really fast.
He just got out of a bad break-up.
He doesn't need some rebound chick
heart-raping him.
I have a boyfriend,
who's driven and successful...
Kevin is my best friend in the world.
And if you hurt him,
I will wear your ass like a leg warmer.
Great job up there!
Jammer! Come to Fleck's with us tonight.
It's Ladies' Night -
epic buzz for minimal ducats!
Hmm...
Maybe, but I'm kind of stressed.
Just want to chill. OK?
Hey, Jam. Sorors from Cornell
are in town tonight - dying to see you.
Fleck's, at 11:00. Ladies night.
Oh...
Uh...
Come, for reals!
SBBs are actually missing you!
Aw.
Not to nag, but this MIA routine
is making girls feel some kind of way.
Beautiful brown boo!
My plans fell through.
You down for some spoken word tonight?
Ew.
You know, I've been thinking about you.
All good thoughts.
Well, mostly good thoughts.
Are you there?
Childproof your thoughts, buddy.
I've got a boyfriend, remember?
What are you talking about?
I'll stop by on my way to Fleck's!
The sorors wanna
bring the party to you!
Are we role-playing again?
I'm coming over.
God!
What?
Grab me a cheeseburger pizza
and some bacon-wrapped onion rings.
It's Faturday night!
 Sorry, Bishop.
That was for the hubby.
Do not judge my carb-loading.
Weird.
God!
OK. Hold that pose.
Throw your hand sign up.
You've got to let people know
the koala bear is your emblem.
This is an applause break and a chance
for you guys to catch your breath.
Also, you'll stop becoming moving targets.
Get ready for projectiles:
hot dogs, sodas,
any aerodynamic concession, really.
If they throw it,
they better be ready to catch it.
- It doesn't matter. We are gonna kill it.
- There's one more thing.
You guys need to get intense.
Gentlemen!
Greetings from the brothers
of the rugged, the raucous,
and oh-so-ruthless Rho Lambda Chapter!
Rho Beta Mu fraternity, incorporated!
Rho, Beta, Beta, Beta Mu!
Jesus Christ.
Ladies, introduce yourselves!
- Amber.
- SBB!
I'm from Texas. I'm actually...
- Shh.
- Pitiful!
Man, you all need to spit with some fire.
Put some bass and gravel in your voice!
You all can say some
whack-ass words all day,
but if you spit with some fire,
it will make people's ass hair stand up!
Hey.
Their ass!
Make their ass hair... stand up!
Serious.
Shut up!
Say "Hello Kitty."
- Are you hitting on me?
- I said, say "Hello Kitty!"
- Hello Kitty.
- Louder!
Hello Kitty!
Not the back of your throat,
from the bottom of your ass!
- Hello Kitty!
- Louder!
Hello Kitty!
- Say "Honey Boo Boo!"
- Honey Boo Boo.
Pull that Barbie
out of your butt, sis!
Honey Boo Boo!
- Chicken!
- Chicken!
- Tenders!
- Tenders!
- Chicken tenders!
- Chicken tenders!
I said, chicken tenders!
I said, chicken tenders!
Calm down, white girl.
Say "Chef Boyardee."
You've got to be kidding me.
Come on "Becky with the Good Hair!"
Say it like you mean it!
Chef Boyardee, bitch!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
Shit!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!
Now, who are you?
SBB!
I can't hear you!
SBB!
SBB!
SBB!
Yo!
- Jam. What's up, Dane?
- Hi.
- The white girls are stepping tonight.
- No!
If they wanna sample the black experience,
let them be slaves and step in chains,
and we'll knock 100 points
off their credit score.
- See how they feel about that!
- Aisha!
Yeah, I know, girl.
What are you doing? Come on!
They don't know, do they?
Lying to your own sorors.
Sad times.
Let's get through this, so I can go home
and fling myself off the balcony.
Bishop!
God, you're gonna feel really bad
when I have a heart attack.
Is that how you greet your boss?
Dane Hagley. It's a pleasure, sir.
I've heard such great things.
I'm proud of you
for marrying your life partner.
You're a brave soldier, in the war...
on intolerance.
So, The Daily Orange is coming,
as well as some other local media.
- Hopefully, we'll get exposure.
- Fingers crossed.
Between the community service
and the step show, this might work.
If this doesn't work, we're screwed.
Sad times.
Sad times!
Alright, Westcott.
Alright.
Remind me again
for whom I should be rooting?
- Root for whomever you want.
- Oh.
Up next,
we have one of the best step teams.
I do not think you are ready.
What's wrong?
Oh, oh, nothing. Nothing.
It's just my nervous cry.
It makes for really awkward job interviews
and first dates.
Damn. It doesn't take but a stiff breeze
to get a white girl crying.
It's a serious condition!
Up next, it is our undefeated
stepping champions.
It's the Biggie Smalls of stepping,
the lovely ladies of Theta Chi Phi!

for those Thetas!
OK, Sigmas,
do we want to be the girls who bombed?
Or do you want to be the girls
that blew the roof off this bitch?
I wanna blow the roof off the bitch.
Yes, Libby.
We have a different flavor
going on today.
# TheyAreWhiteAsShit.
That's racist. She's being racist.
Black people can't be racist
to white people.
Oh, my God. Never say that again.
Systemic racism.
Where the shit is Amber?
She's on her way.
Get your hot sauce in your bag swag,
because shit's about to get
real bland around here.
Alright.
- Put your hands together.
- Line, now.
Give it up for Sigma Beta Beta!
Time for the rodeo!
Yee-haw, girl!
- Cowboys? That's cool. Yeah.
- What's wrong?
If there's any Native Americans in the
audience, they'd feel great about that.
It's not like it was a genocide
or anything!

Dean Berman,
I'd like to formally request
sobriety tests for all those young ladies,
because there's no way they came out here
and did that sober.
And then the girl fell at the end.
What did she trip on? Life?
Let's give it up
for our sisters in Christ,
Sigma Beta We-Don't-Have-Rhythm-eta!
Iggy Azalea, come on down.
Get your back out there.
At least it's for breast cancer.
Oh, my God.
Bishop!
SBB couldn't even nail
their dance routine?
I'm pulling their charter.
- Dean Berman, wait...
- I can see the hashtags already.
# BlackSteppersMatter.
# SteppersSoWhite.
- We're lucky we didn't have a race riot.
- You're overreacting. Shocker.
Please be patient. I promise
I will show you what SBB is capable of.
It didn't work. It's over, Bishop.
Let's go.
I am so not in the mood to socialize.
Wow. It's come to this, huh?
Cowering to avoid your own betrayal?
OK, you are being super judgy.
Sorry, "super judgy"?
Jesus, you're becoming one of them.
Don't forget you had a brain
before these Beckys turned you.
Oh, what, you actually care about SBB?
Enough to help, yeah.
This is serious.
You've abetted the latest cultural theft.
Well, get ready for white,
WASP-y step shows to sweep the nation.
Blond ponytails swinging,
stomping off beat...
What's up, brother?
Catch you later. Good looks.
Now whitey can add stepping
to the long list of things
we've stolen from black culture,
including jazz, rock and roll,
those beaded vacation cornrows.
OK, that is on you, Slugworth.
We need to break up.
No, we don't need to break up. I got us
tickets to the New Edition reunion tour.
Dane, you're never on my side.
I didn't see it before
because you look great on paper.
You're smart, handsome,
you don't have that weird white-boy smell.
White-boy smell?
It's like old leather couch and wet dog
and hair gel and...
It doesn't matter.
I'm done being proof
of how liberal you are.
That's what your Prius is for.
Beaded vacation cornrows?
Really?
Well, I guess we all know
who's responsible for all this.
- Dean Berman?
- Miss Libby.
Enough with the slut-shaming.
What are you, a virgin?
Yes. I'm a Catholic.
- Stop fighting.
- The white girls crashed and burned.
The ones who were there
when the show started?
They did just fine.
It's a shame that I was the only one
who took this seriously.
Are you kidding me?
Stop! Stop!
This is a shit show!
Right? We would have been fine
if you had showed up on time...
No! I'm talking about your sorority!
Nobody respects you guys
because you don't respect each other.
There is zero sisterhood here.
Danielle, why did you choose
these girls at rush?
Why did you choose Amber?
Because I knew if we ever needed help
dropping and-or popping it,
we'd have an instructor.
What about my face
is giving you joke time?
She was a tough broad.
In a campus full of girly-girls,
I thought...
well, here is this badass chick
who's wicked smart,
sees through bullshit,
and plays by her own rules.
I respected that.
OK.
What about Saundra?
Saundra's...
unique.
And fashionable.
She had a bad experience
with another sorority.
I knew their loss was our gain.
OK. This is great. And Libby?
- Her father's very wealthy.
- Come on.
I don't know!
She's...
like an innocent little redneck.
That's not a compliment. That hurt.
No, no. I knew that other houses
would try to turn her into a New Yorker.
She needed a place where she could
let her confederate flag fly.
Uh-uh. No.
- Not literally.
- Not at all.
And me?
I know saying nice things about me
gives you the squirts,
but you're kind of on a roll.
You were an insurance policy.
I knew that...
if I ever had a bad day for the rest
of my time during college...
that you'd be there to cheer me up.
Your positivity is as infectious
as it is nauseating.
Thank you.
Eyelashes are gonna pop off.
Oh, my God, you guys.
There's real love here.
You've got to use it.
This doesn't have to be the end.
There's a way that you guys
can prove to the Greeks
and the rest of the school -
hell, to yourselves -
that you are some badass,
stepping-ass bitches.
That you are a real sorority
and a force to be reckoned with.
How can we do that?
We donate $100,000
to the 40th Street Community Center.
It's Dean Berman's favorite charity.
All we have to do...
is win Steptacular.
It's the regional step show
I told you about.
First prize is a hundred grand.
We didn't even place
at a student step show.
- How are we gonna win at a regional one?
- You choked because your teamwork sucked.
Trust me, if you get that back,
if you build up the sisterhood,
I promise you have a real shot.
I say, hell yeah. I mean, all in favor?
Excuse me. I am the president.
I will conduct the votes.
Look, we had a good run.
Let's just quit while we're ahead.
For the record, when this goes to shit,
I told you so.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I love you. You're the best.
Sometimes...
- Cheers.
- She loves us.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Leaving after one drink?
Are you sure you're an SBB?
I know, right?
Nah, I've got to go.
- But thanks.
- Oh, OK.
Hey, Beth.
- Can I borrow your phone?
- You bet.
Thanks. Good night.
Hey.
Want to chat?
When you bounce from foster home
to foster home, a...
a sorority feels like a stable family.
I didn't tell the girls because
I didn't want to be an SBB charity case.
Yeah, but stripping?
Why not just bartend at Fleck's like Beth?
I make a thousand dollars a night.
Are they hiring?
I'm sorry you've been
going through all this.
What, you think white girls
can't struggle?
The struggle is real.
Please tell me your stripper name.
Bob.
OK, this is a teamwork exercise.
Your arms will stay linked up,
no matter what.
Your sisterhood is your bond.
Do not let it break.
Not ready! I'm not ready! Oh, my God!
- Oh, Libby!
- I'm sorry. I got so scared.
You need to look nasty...
Furious. Demonic. This is your haka.
This is your war cry.
- Guys!
- That was aggressive.
Scare them broads
off your island.
Because this... This is your island.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
SBB Island!
SBB Island!
SBB Island!
- SBB Island!
- Come on!
Can I get an "ugly" on three?
- One, two, three.
- Ugly!
Alright!
We're bonding here!
Get him! Get his nuts!
No, guys! No! No biting!
Word on the street is that you sent
White Malcolm X packing.
Should I believe the streets?
- You can this time.
- Perfect.
Because I have planned
possibly the sickest date
in the history of courtship.
But it's time sensitive,
so we should get going.
OK, I'll just go change.
No need.
You won't be wearing that outfit for long.
Presumptuous.
- And dead wrong.
- Not like that.
It's just,
the best date ever requires...
a little wardrobe change.
Well played, Harris.
Very original.
Yeah.
So...
What are your Theta girls gonna say
now that you're out of the nerd closet?
This is not an image I plan on projecting
to my Thetas.
You know, it's like there's this
awesome chick inside you, right?
But then on the surface,
it's like work, success, motivation...
You wouldn't understand.
- You have white parents.
- What is that...
Bougie black parents are tough. Perfect
black girls did not read comic books.
I had to steal them from my guy friends.
I don't know.
It's like I got so good at doing exactly
what I was supposed to do that...
it didn't really leave time
to find a passion.
You could always be a zombie slayer.
Relax.
You'll figure it out.
It's that simple, huh?
It can be.
So, why are you single?
Uh...
Every girl I tried to date
was crazy, flaky,
and in the last case,
a lesbian.
I feel her pain.
Me too.
So...
Actually,
I have a confession to make.
I am...
sane,
I'm dependable
and mostly...
heterosexual.
I'm from Kappa next door.
You shook our house.
We lost a row of
totally irreplaceable shot glasses.
Hello? I was talking to you!
I think you're ready.
What?
Oh, my God.
I need a shower now.
My boobs are sweaty.
Hey.
What's up, ladies?
Well, this is one lame surprise party.
Mom?
Soror Yvonne.
I am not calling you "Soror Yvonne."
Did you violate the sanctity
of our sisterhood?
Have you betrayed all of your black,
Greek brothers and sisters?
Those are very abstract questions.
Oh, so you think this is funny?
Well, let me remind you.
Our organizations were founded
to create community where there was none,
built upon sisterhood,
in a world that did not welcome us.
And over a hundred years,
we have stood the test of time.
This is your fault!
- My...
- Yes! You and Dad screwed me with Harvard.
This has nothing to do with family.
Well, I didn't start this conversation,
and I damn sure didn't send for you.
Sorry it's not going the way you planned,
Soror Yvonne.
You do not deserve to wear our letters.
You lied to my face.
We don't get down with you anymore,
so when you see us around...
keep walking.
- Aisha...
- I don't care.
Why don't you just run to the SBBs?
They're not your sorors.
They're not your friends.
You're the help.
That's how those bitches look at you.
And that's how
they will always look at you.
Actions have consequences, Jamilah.
Why don't you just step?
When you took this job,
I told you that
even though you're still a student,
you represent this office.
Of course.
Then why am I seeing these?
Oh...
God. Oh.
I wasn't in the twerk pyramid.
- God.
- What were you thinking?
- I know this looks really bad...
- I'm sorry. I have to fire you.
And Nick and I can't endorse you
to Harvard.
Not now.
Yo, Jam. What do you think?
Jamilah?
What's wrong, honey?
I got fired.
What?
- What happened?
- No!
Dean Berman found pictures of me
partying here, with you guys,
and I'm an employee, so...
So we're gonna do something about this.
- Like what?
- I don't know. Give me 40 seconds.
- I don't have these things chambered.
- Wait, how did he get the pictures?
Aisha.
- What?
- She did not!
SBB isn't the only sorority
with internal drama.
Yeah, but you're not gonna
beez out on us, right?
Um...
Listen, guys, I...
I only have one class left,
and I can finish it online.
So...
So I'm gonna go back to Philly
and figure out my next move.
- What? We're not done choreographing.
- Steptacular is ten days away.
What are we supposed to do
without our captain?
Danielle is your captain.
It will be fine. You guys know this stuff.
You don't have a job.
Just stay with us until Steptacular.
- I really can't.
- This is bullshit.
I don't have time for this, you guys!
I have spent every minute on SBB.
- Now, I have no job, my sorors hate me...
- And that's our fault?
My life was perfect before coaching SBB.
This is obviously
the worst mistake I've made.
Wow.
You spout out this sisterhood shit,
and then you bail when we need you?
What was in it for you?
So you and the Thetas could just laugh
at a bunch of dumb white girls?
- Hello! We're not all white girls.
- To get closer to my brother?
To boost your resume for Harvard?
Was...
Was it for Harvard?
Harvard?
Yeah, Jamilah wants to go to Harvard Law.
And Dean Berman is an alum.
And so, what?
You worked out a deal that
if you tame some crazy white girls,
he'd put in a good word?
I figured everybody wins.
I get to go to law school,
your charter is safe,
the community center gets money.
You know what?
You're an asshole.
And I am done with you.
You're a goddam phony.
Freshman year,
I went to a Theta informational meeting.
My mother and my grandmother,
they're both Thetas.
But you guys rejected me
because I was too whitewashed.
I didn't realize.
It's fine.
I dodged a bullet.
SBB is not perfect.
But at least we judge on actions
and not stereotypes.
We're better off without you...
sis.
Long-distance things
don't work all the time.
Neither do airbags.
I just have to do what's best for me.
Only problem is just that
you have no idea what that is.
What the...
OK.
You messed with the wrong bitch today!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought you were a crazy person.
Obviously, I was right.
I sent the pictures to Dean Berman.
I thought you'd get into a little trouble
and we could bail on Steptacular,
and I could get SBB back in order.
I was trying to protect Kevin!
I do not believe this shit!
After everything I did for you?
In all fairness, you did it for yourself.
Actually, it was me. It was me!
It was all me!
You are so pretty.
Please come back.
SBB needs you.
You may not actually be an SBB,
but you're still one of our sisters.
I was your coach!
Your...
Your friend.
Not your sister.
It doesn't work like that.
I thought Steptacular was a bad idea
from the beginning. I admit it.
But the girls really want to do it...
together.
Please, stay.
Help us be better sisters.
You said it yourself: there's no better
feeling than helping people who need it.
I...
am not...
the help!
I'm pretty sure I said, "Keep walking,"
yet here you are.
I came to say goodbye.
And to apologize.
I screwed up.
Just for fun, you know, come in. Come in.
I'd love to hear this, just for fun.
How did you screw up?
- I lied to you.
- Uh-huh.
And I bailed on SBB.
And...
I disappointed my parents.
You know what? Take that off the list.
That doesn't bother me.
Do you even hear yourself?
Those are all the same problem.
You're a user.
I am not a user.
You used SBB and Dean Berman
to get into Harvard.
And to be honest, Jamilah,
I always thought you've been
using Theta for years
to prove how black you are.
OK.
Yeah.
I did.
I joined a black sorority
because I wanted people
to stop calling me "white girl" or "Oreo."
I admit that was the wrong reason.
You have to understand. I...
I love Theta. I love my sorors.
You let them take stepping from us.
Aisha, white people said the same thing
about Tiger Woods
and the Williams sisters.
We said the same thing about Eminem.
Races can't own things.
I give up.
Text from Beth.
So much for "Perfection over excellence,
sister over self."
#WeakPeopleQuit.
I am in love with my Meat Genie.
You're going to love it even more.
Look what it can do now!
Giant, hefty man-sized sandwiches.
Golden, fluffy pancakes, quiches,
and pot pies, too.
You've improved what was already perfect.
It gets better.
You aren't winning shit,
sitting around like this.
Listen.
I don't have a job, or a man,
or a shot at law school.
But I'm here
because I believe you guys can win.
So, either prove me wrong,
or get your asses in gear,
because we have a step show in one week.
You never took off your workout clothes.
- Alright, alright.
- Thank you.
Alright.
I know you missed me.
Hey.
Listen.
Theta missed out.
You'd have been a great soror.
But I'll settle for a friend.
Let's win, sis.

We have been doing this all night!
Oh, I think I gave myself a hemorrhoid.
OK, fine. Take five.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
It's Kevin.
I haven't seen him this upset
since they canceled Star Trek: Voyager.
Is he sad about me?
Or is he sad that his sister
tried to sabotage his girlfriend?
- I said the "G" word.
- Yeah, you did.
Do you think he'd talk to me?
Get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.

Look, Kevin.
I've always been good at everything.
Very little in life has challenged me.
I had a clear image of my perfect guy,
and it looked nothing like you.
- Why are your apologies so mean?
- No! You don't look bad.
You look great,
beautiful,
tall and handsome,
and your teeth are so white.
Your skin is so smooth and soft,
like a baby, and it's hairless.
I have no idea how you do it.
And you're just like...
You're a goofball.
You play video games online
with 12-year-olds.
- I'm about to ask you to leave because...
- Hey, I'm trying to be corny here.
I realize that Harvard
is what my parents wanted.
Well, what do you want?
I don't know.
But I know I want you.
I know I want to give us another shot.
What do you say?
That I'm never gonna be a six-foot-four
football-playing lawyer
who knows all the lyrics to old
Tribe Called Quest songs.
And that's who you always wanted, so go...
Go find him and...
Hey.
Actually...
don't find that guy.
In fact,
Eff that guy.
He probably doesn't exist anyway.
I do.

What if they boo us off
like Showtime at the Apollo?
Oh, God. Is that clown guy
with the long cane thingy here?
Are you guys feeling out of place,
like maybe they're judging you
before you've expressed yourselves?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Tell me something.
How do you think they feel
when they're the only black person
in a class or at the office?

Yeah! There it is. I told you...
OK. Sigma Beta Beta,
leaving their footprint on this stage.
You never know what you're gonna get
at the Steptacular!
I see some of you sisters in the crowd
are a little salty.
You didn't expect that, did you?
Uh-huh. I see you over there.
"It was alright. It was alright.
It wasn't all that."
You guys slayed.
I am so proud of you.
White girl tears. It's contagious.
Our judges have made their decisions.
All competitors to the stage.
And now, for the moment
we all have been waiting for...
Let's get ready for the tears
and the cheers.
In third place,
taking home $10,000,
all the way from Hampton University,
Sigma Delta Eta!
Come on, now!
Give it up for them.
This is yours. Come here.
Come here.
And in second place,
winning $25,000...
I want you to make some noise
for Heta Rho Nu!
Yeah!
And now, first-place winners,
taking home $100,000!
That's a lot of money.
All the way from Westcott University...
Make some noise for the sexy sorority.
Put your hands together
for your Steptacular champions of 2017...
Theta Chi Phi!
Come on, now.
Alright! Give them that thing.
You deserved it.
You deserved it.
So, that's it.
No money, no donation,
no reinstatement.
I want a picture with your fine ass.
All day, baby.
Check this out. Me and the judges
got a little creative with the scores.
You know what I'm saying?
We've got to keep stepping ours.
- Come on with the picture.
- Wait. Wait, what?
You know how it is.
Can't give them second. You feel me?
Give me that. Excuse me.
Hello, hello! Excuse me!
Hold up.
This fool right here,
he just told me the judges
changed a score,
so that SBB would lose
and stepping would stay ours.
It's not right.
It's 2017.
According to the real scores,
SBB came in second place tonight.
And it's not right.
Listen, it is not right.
We need to give them their just due.
Come on.
Are you all gonna give it to them?
Whoa!
Really? Ooh! You all are really,
really testing my nerves.
You know what?
Come on, Becky.
Uh, Britney. Oh, gosh.
What's the child's name again?
- Beth!
- Beth.
Beth. OK.
You all need to show some love to Beth
and her sorors. Come on.
Some love...
Because we, Theta Chi Phi,
we're gonna do the right thing
and split our check
with the real second-place team,
Sigma Beta Beta,
the real second-place step team.
OK. Alright. OK.
Under the tutelage
of trailblazing senior, Jamilah Bishop,
SBB has made history
and managed to keep
a community institution's doors open.
- That's my baby girl.
- I know.
Hi, guys.
I can be strong-willed,
forceful,
intransigent.
All qualities that make me
one of the best judges in Pennsylvania.
But they can also make me
a difficult mother.
And I've learned,
with the help of my therapist...
that I am jealous
that you are a freer spirit than I.
And I am working on
accepting you unconditionally
because that is the way I love you.
If you do it one more time, Negro...
I know how to be civil,
unlike a certain physically fit
White House princess.
You are literally
the only person in the world
that does not love Michelle Obama.
But most importantly,
we're endorsing you to Harvard, baby girl.
I'm not going to Harvard.
What's next for you?
Get my drink on,
grab a couple guys,
try out my new vibrator.
Boundaries! Hello!
Seriously, don't dodge the question.
What's next?
You know, I've never said this...
I don't know.
I don't know.
Feels good.
Luckily, I can work at 40th Street
until I figure it out.
You're a real rock star over there.
I've got to run. Nick just got back
from The Pleasure Chest.
I heard you got shit canned.
And I let you get away.
Hmm...
Look, I know some people speechify
about inclusion and equality and...
Uh-huh.
I do. Fine. I do. But...
I mean, you really
walked the walk with SBB,
and I'm proud of you.
Look, I...
I should have never
taken you for granted, Jamilah.
Dane, we're cool.
You're still my nigga.
That's...
That's...
That's the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.
As-Salaam-Alaikum.
Come on, Jam!
I feel like Robyn over there,
Dancing on My Own.
Oh, I'm sorry.
OK. Hello?
Before you two get to second base,
girl, you feel like strolling?
You know I do.
Get her, boo.
You're a little freak.
Yeah.
I'm watching you.
