- Welcome to ACT UP!
We are the AlDS Coalition
to Unleash Power,
a diverse, nonpartisan
group of individuals
united in anger
and committed to direct action
to...
crowd: End the AlDS crisis!
- Less than 1 2 hours
from now,
we are going to be taking over
city hall!
[applause]
all: Act up!
Fight back!
Fight AlDS!
- Yes?
- Mr. Mayor, in campaigning
for the lesbian and gay vote
in an election year,
a bit of historical context
is necessary
in dealing with the AlDS crisis
in New York City.
It wasn't until 1 983
that you met with people
to deal with
the AlDS crisis.
How do you respond
to these criticisms?
- That is a falsehood.
- Please, anybody who's
thinking about being arrested,
fill out a support sheet.
Make sure that
your support person
knows who you are
and what group you're in.
Yeah?
- If we end up in the Tombs,
is there, like,
a queer tank there,
and would you recommend
that we ask to be there?
- There is a homo-tank,
and I've been there.
And it's better
than the straight tank,
Iet me tell you.
- Who else?
Yes?
- In the past, you've described
ACT UP as fascist.
Yet in the press release,
you called them
"concerned citizens,"
and I was wondering
what changed your mind.
- I don't think
that you can't use both.
Fascists can be
concerned citizens.
And I don't believe
they are fascists.
I think they have used
a fascist tactic.
- Let us celebrate together
tonight
the end of the last day
on which Ed Koch
can tell himself
that the communities
which are being decimated
by this epidemic
are so weak and so divided
among themselves,
that he can keep serving us
this kind of bullshit.
Tomorrow morning, he will begin
to learn the truth!
[cheers and applause]
all: Act up, stand tall,
tomorrow morning
at city hall!
Act up, stand tall,
tomorrow morning
at city hall!
Act up, stand tall,
tomorrow morning
at city hall!
Act up, stand tall...

- We're talking to Jim Eigo
from the Treatment lssues
Committee in ACT UP.
Jim, what specific
treatment issues
are being brought into
this demonstration this week?
- The municipal hospitals
are totally falling apart.
More than half the people
who get diagnosed
with AlDS today
get diagnosed in
the emergency rooms of our city.
You're going to find yourself
waiting four days
in an emergency room
before you get a bed.
- Pretty scared,
but being HlV-positive,
I don't have much choice
in the matter.
- I just love
all these people,
and I think that what
we're doing is really right.
And, I mean, listen to this,
and look at all the people.
It's just really wonderful,
and it's worth putting yourself
on the line for.
- There is no
accurate diagnosis.
There are incentives
in the city hospitals
not to diagnose people
with AlDS.
And therefore,
people don't get treated.
We are angry
at the way this city
has handled this crisis,
and we demand that Ed Koch
exert leadership
and declare
a state of emergency.
[cheering]
- Go in the street now
or wait;
those are the options.
One, he says go.
- Two now.
- Says "now."
Three.
Tom?
"Go now," Tom says.
- We're standing here
with Larry Kramer.
What is ACT UP
trying to say today to Ed Koch?
- We're sending a message
to public officials,
to closeted public officials,
that we won't be shat on
anymore
and obviously
all the AlDS issues.
- I would love to see, like,
more cameras or something,
you know,
for our own protection.
- Did everyone hear his concern?
- People die every day.
Friends get sick every day.
I don'tÜÜÜÜÜ
It's like being in the trenches.
There's such anger
in the community,
and it is coalescing
in a way
that has never been done
before.
- Okay, which way do we face,
girlfriends,
this way or that way?
[cheers and applause]
[car horns blaring]
all: Health care is a right.
Health care is a right!
Health care is a right.
Health care is a right!
Health care is a right.
Health care is a right!
Pump up the budget!
Health care is a right.
Health care is a right!
- You are currently
in violation of the law
by obstructing vehicular
and pedestrian traffic.
You have the option of leaving
at this time, otherwise...
[crowd shouting indistinctly]
- Act up!
- Never be silent again!
all: Fight AlDS!
Act up!
Fight back!
Fight AlDS!
Act up!
Fight back!
[indistinct shouting]
[whistle blows]
- Fight back!
Fight AlDS!
[crowd clamoring]
- Act up!
[siren wailing]
all: Fight back!
Fight AlDS!
Stand up!
Fight back!
- This man
is a personal friend!
Be careful!
- They're arresting journalists
now!
- Act up!
Act up!
Act up!
[all shouting indistinctly]
- Act up!
Fight AlDS!
Pray for the dead!
[all clamoring]
- Fight back!
Fight AlDS!
[dramatic percussive music]
? ?
- I guess I'm feeling
pretty hopeless at the moment.
I think, like, the biggest
question that I'm facing now
is how to
remain hopeful
in the face of increasing loss.
- I don't know.
Maybe it sounds really corny,
but l...
As difficult
as the time is for us,
IÜÜÜÜl like being alive.
And I love my friends,
and I love my family.
I love the people around me.
- I'm going to die from this.
This isn't going to be cured
for years and years
and years.
- Doctor's office.
- Hi, it's Peter Staley.
It's like living in a war.
All around me,
friends are dropping dead,
and you're scared
for your own life
all at the same time.
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]
I was diagnosed
with AlDS-related complex
while I was working
as a bond trader on Wall Street.
I had night sweats.
I began to get dry, patchy,
scaly, itchy skin on my face.
And I would get sick
constantly.
Colds would lay me up
for weeks.
I started to look around
in desperation
for ways that
I could find treatments
to help save my life.
Um...
And there was nothing coming out
of our government's efforts,
I quickly realized.
Everything I read
said I had about two years
to live,
at most.
- What do we want?
crowd: A cure!
- When do we want it?
crowd: Now!
- What do we want?
crowd: A cure!
- When do we want it?
crowd: Now!
- What do we want?
crowd: A cure!
- When do we want it?
crowd: Now!
- I was on my way to work,
and I got handed a flyer
about ACT UP and AlDS.
My mentor says,
"lf you ask me,
"l think they all deserve
to die
because they took it
up the butt."
I was deeply closeted,
and I had to just stew about it
for the rest of the day.
I got myself to the very next
ACT UP meeting.
They could just tap into that
immediate anger
and get stuff done.
We will not leave until
an administrator meets with us
and tells us
that St. Vincent's
is willing to make
a public statement
condemning gay and lesbian
violence.
[cheers and applause]
All those in favor?
All those opposed?
- They're coming!
You see them right there.
You've heard about ACT UP.
You've seen our flyers.
The kiss-in happens tonight.
Act up!
Fight back!
Make love!
Act up!
Whoo, whoo!
- I'll deal with the camerasÜÜÜÜÜ
- Are you the security guard
that was beating people up?
- Out with the cameras.
[crowd chattering indistinctly]
- Members of the mainstream
media were thrown out,
as we were earlier on,
but Steve Zabel and l
came back in,
and we're bringing you
this exclusive footage.
- Don't destroy property!
You're destroying property.
- Well, actually you damaged
some human property last week.
- You damaged people.
- You will not
beat up on faggots,
and you will not
beat up on lesbians
in hospitals
in our own communities.
- Two gay women
were beaten up,
and when her lover
came to respondÜÜÜÜ
you know the story.
And another story
was when two gay guys came here,
and one was sick with AlDS.
The security guard told him to,
"Get the fuck out of here"
and called him "faggot."
I think
if you're gonna work,
especially
in Greenwich Village,
you should have
some sensitivity training,
'cause we're not gonna have it.
- I'm willing to meet
with three people
if the rest of you leave.
[crowd chattering indistinctly]
- Okay, one at a time.
One at a time.
- It's unclear how to play it.
My own instinct would be
to say,
"We'll be glad
to meet with you.
And when the meeting's over,
we'll leave."
Not to leave
before the meeting takes place.
- Gregg?
- We've shown
the kind of power we can have
by immediate action,
by sticking together,
by reaching a consensus
together.
We should take this in steps,
and we should be coolheaded.
- I'm gonna take a straw poll,
okay?
And we agreed
to leave the waiting room
while he met with
three of our representativesÜÜÜÜ
Gregg, Jerry, and NeilÜÜÜÜ
in that public space
right there.
And then we would
stick around out here
and wait to see
what the outcome was.
- So I said, "Enough of this.
This job is gonna kill me."
So I went on disability
and decided to become
a full-time AlDS activist.
- In the beginning,
what drugs did we have?
We had nothing.
And the pneumonia
could come on like that
and be gone,
and a person is dead.
The skin lesions,
the Kaposi's sarcoma was...
People would be coming in
with a purple spot.
Everybody was coming in with,
"What is this spot?
What is that spot?"
You'd have some guys come in
with KS on their face,
and they'd be putting makeup
on their face.
And they'd beÜÜÜÜ
it wasÜÜÜÜÜ
And they were lucky
if it just stayed
in the skin,
if it didn't
go into their lungs.
And then if it
went into their lungs,
chemo didn't work,
and then they were gone.
You were grasping at straws
for everything,
because these are young,
vibrant people.
And all of a sudden,
they're being snatched.
I think everything
has to be put in perspective.
- Larry?
- Hello.
- [chuckles]
- lris Long is lifesaving.
If you can't hear in the back
and you want to,
just shout it out, please.
- This is a report
from the American Society
of Microbiology,
a conference I went to
at the end of May.
- Quiet!
- There were many infections
talked aboutÜÜÜÜÜ
including AlDSÜÜÜÜ
at this conference,
and it was overwhelming
to know how many pathogens,
bacteria, fungus,
protozoas, and viruses
that are out there
that can really, uh...
make you very sick.
- One day, this woman
just showed up,
this housewife, who had been
a scientist and still was,
and said, "You guys don't know
diddly about what this is.
"And anybody who wants to learn
about the system,
"how it works,
"how grants are made,
how the science works,
"how everything works,
"how the NlH works,
"how the FDA works,
"how you can deal with
"all this
enormous amount of material,
I'll teach you."
- There should be much more
funding than there is
for infectious diseases.
- lris was not gay,
but she could not see,
with what was going on
around her and what she knew,
not reaching out to the
affected communities of AlDS.
- I waited
and went up to lris afterwards
and said, "I'm interested
in what you were saying.
"I'd like to know more.
I'd like to help."
- And a few people
joined her,
and that became
a bigger and bigger group,
and that became the Treatment
and Data Committee: T&D.
- They're still getting
a hell of a lot more money
than actually getting
those treatments to anybody.
It was kind of
a dorky activity
for a bunch of East Village
hipsters and artists
to sit around reading
medical journal articles.
We called it science club,
Iike it was chess club
or something.
- There aren't drugs.
- lndividual after individual
had to come to grips
with the fact that,
"l will survive
the longest,
the most I know about
what I'm putting into my body."
So they all
had to be become scientists,
to some degree.
- And what I would like
everyone to do
would be to keep on thinking
of ways to refine these things
to make them more clear
to people
that don't necessarily
know the issues, like Ol.
No one knows what Ol is.
Okay, so I wrote it here,
just 'cause it's shorthand.
Only 1 7% of people
in their trials
have been taking drugs
for opportunistic infections
or cancers.
- Mark wasn't, like,
the big, beefcakey guy.
He was super smart,
smoked nonstop.
- Right away,
Mark digested,
as by osmosis,
everything.
And within a few weeks,
he had come up with a glossary
of AlDS treatment terms,
and we started giving it out
in our meetings.
- Next we have an announcement
by Tom Dwayne
regarding housing.
- This is Bernard Braverman,
who's in danger
of being evicted
from his apartment that
he shared with his life partner
for many, many years.
His life partner died,
and the landlord wants Bernard
out of his home
because his name
was not on the lease.
- What's his landlord's address?
[laughter]
- We'll find him.
- There are cards here
to fill out,
to write to the governor.
Let's make sure that our voices
are heard in New York City
to save the homes of PWAs
and other
nontraditional families.
Thank you very much.
[cheers and applause]
- I just want to say something
about what's just happened.
I realized we haven't done
anything yet for him
and we haven't been effective
and we haven't been powerful,
but we will be.
It's very inspiring to know
the power in this room
is potentially available
to each and every one of us.
[cheers and applause]
- One, two, three.
[girl laughs]
Good?
How was it?
Is that as good as Daddy's
or better?
- You're better.
- Yay!
- Would you like Daddy
to try it?
Are you ready?
- [laughs and shrieks]
That's not very good.
[laughter]
- One, two, three.
- I know this sounds ironic,
considering that
it ended in divorce,
but I think
it is fair to say
it's the only really successful
love affair of my life.
I came out at age 40.
It was very bad timing
to come out
in the middle
of an epidemic.
The question is,
what does a decent society do
with people who hurt themselves
because they're human,
who smoke too much,
who eat too much,
who drive carelessly,
who don't have safe sex?
I think the answer
is that a decent society
does not put people
out to pasture
and let them die because
they've done a human thing.
- For the first time today,
the government approved
prescription sales
of a drug to treat AlDS.
The drug, AZT,
is not a cure for the disease,
but it has prolonged the lives
of some AlDS victims.
It's the only
government-approved AlDS drug
in America.
But even
this most promising of drugs
is a source of frustration
and anger.
At $1 0,000 a year cost
per patient,
it's prohibitively expensive
for most
and not widely available.
all: Out of the bars
and into the streets!
Out of the bars
and into the streets!
- AZT was the most expensive
drug in history.
They charge $1 0,000 a year.
We need to get a substantial
price reduction
out of this company.
- The incident began
at 10:0 this morning
when four AlDS activists
took over an office
at Burroughs Wellcome,
saying they had enough
food and water
to stay holed up
for a long time.
The activists are demanding
that Burroughs Wellcome
Iower its price of AZT.
- Burroughs Wellcome
is profiting off of our lives.
That's why we did today
what we did.
And if they don't see to
start listening to my community,
to our community,
the AlDS community,
then we're gonna be back.
[solemn music]
? ?
- One of the worst,
worst things was,
when people died
in the hospital,
they used to put them
in black trash bags.
It wasÜÜÜÜÜ
[scoffs]
It was really awful.
And not every funeral parlor
would take patients
who had died of AlDS.
- ButÜÜÜÜÜso the least
we could offer
is sympathy
and moral support,
you know, and kindness
and so forth.
And that, they deserved,
in any case.
And when even that
became denied,
you know, by the totalitarian
rules of organizations,
of institutions,
it was really horrifying.
- It is the most frightening
medical mystery of our times.
AlDS victims must deal
with the trauma
of being both a patient
and a pariah.
- I hate to use the word "gay"
in connection with sodomy.
There's nothing gay
about these people
engaging in incredibly offensive
and revolting conduct
that has led to
the proliferation of AlDS.
- There is a feeling
among members
of any of a number
of professions
or just the general population
that patients with AlDS,
many of whom are homosexual,
are a little bit different.
I think that that has led to
a little bit of a complacency
about the approach
towards this disease.
- In the absence
of adequate health care,
we have learned to become
our own clinicians,
researchers, lobbyists,
drug smugglers, pharmacists.
We have our own libraries,
newspapers, drugstores,
and laboratories.
- Some of the medications
that were made available
were not effective.
They were in this category
that we called
"what the hell" drugs,
which is, "There's some evidence
it could be useful.
It's unlikely to be harmful.
What the hell?"
- Should I type?
[laughs]
- Yes, type.
Take your time.
Where are we?
- We're at the People With AlDS
Health Group,
the largest
underground buyers' club
in the United States.
- And what do you do here?
- We help people import drugs
from other countries,
um, that are unapproved here:
Peptide T, Albendazole,
Oral Amphotericin B.
We have a whole
variety of things
for your treatment pleasure.
[chuckles]
None of which work,
by the way.
[laughter]
Put that in.
- People with AlDS,
what they were
mostly thinking about was,
"Oh, drugs,
how do I get it off-market?
"How do lÜÜÜÜÜ
"Will we ever get
a black market for this drug?
I hear this is good and"ÜÜÜÜ
It was lris
who helped us see;
we don't want
a black market.
We want to make
the real market work.
[static buzzing]
- Try it.
[match strikes]
Hi, I'm Mark Harrington
from ACT UP New York.
Recently, a lot of activists
have been asking
why ACT UP is going...
Uh.
You've got to start over.
I got to do thatÜÜÜÜ
I've got to do that over.
- You can just
start yourself over.
- But lÜÜÜÜbut I won't get
that wonderful
cigarette-lighting thing.
- I think the cigarette
maybe is not going to work.
- I shouldn't use the cigarette
at all, really?
- I don't think so.
It's too, umÜÜÜÜtoo much.
- Too much?
[inhaling]
Hi, I'm Mark Harrington
from ACT UP New York.
A lot of people
have been asking,
"Why are AlDS activists
going to the FDA?"
First of all,
you have to understand
that the FDA is one of the many
federal AlDS bureaucracies
which we're angry with
for not doing enough
in the fight against AlDS.
Half the people who take AZT
can't take it
'cause of side effects.
And therefore, the FDA has
to take a more activist stance
in the experimental process.
And only the FDA
has the power
under existing laws
and regulations
to release the drugs
that we want released now.
[static buzzing]
How's that?
crowd: AZT is not enough!
Give us all the other stuff!
AZT is not enough!
Give us
all the other stuff!
AZT is not enough!
Give us all the other stuff!
- It takes nine months
to test a drug in Europe,
in Belgium, in France,
in Germany, in England.
We are not asking the FDA
to release dangerous drugs
without safety or efficacy.
We are simply asking the FDA
to do it quicker.
crowd: Drugs for sale!
Drugs for sale!
- Dextran sulfate for sale.
Get your dextran here.
You can't get it inside.
[indistinct chanting]
- FDAÜÜÜÜÜ
but we're selling it anyway.
- $30 for dextran sulfate!
crowd: Release the drugs now!
Release the drugs now!
Release the drugs now!
Get to work!
Get to work!
Get to work!
Get to work!
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

[cameras clicking]
[indistinct shouting
and chanting]
[whistle blows]
- Start fighting!
- Come on, tell us why
you got arrested.
Where are they taking you?
What's going on today?
- We don't know what'sÜÜÜÜÜ
where they're taking us.
We're here
because this government
has the resources
to deal with the AlDS epidemic,
and they won't do it
unless we force them.
- l.J. Hutchins
reports live from Rockville,
where the massive protest
is wrapping up.
I.J.?
- Well, Jim,
it's being billed
as one of Montgomery County's
biggest demonstrations
in recent history,
and it went off smoothly.
1 85 arrests,
as a coalition of gay groups
came to Rockville
to shut down the FDA.
- Tonight, from Washington,
Crossfire: Against All Odds.
On the left, Tom Braden.
On the right, Pat Buchanan.
In the cross fire,
Peter Staley
of the New York AlDS Coalition
to Unleash Power.
- Peter Staley,
you have the AlDS virus,
and I am sorry.
But don't you think that
the Federal Drug Administration
has a responsibility
not to let people,
such as you, have quacks
that could cause even more harm
than you already have?
- The problem is,
is that the FDA
is using the same process
to test a nasal spray
as it is to test AlDS drugs,
and it's a seven-
to ten-year process.
- You have the FDA
giving you a drug.
So far, you've got AZT.
WhyÜÜÜÜ
- Which I can't take
because it's tooÜÜÜÜÜ
far too toxic.
And over half the people
that have HlV can't take it.
- Okay, but the FDA says
there is nothing else
that is worth anything.
- Mr. Staley,
this is gonna astonish you,
but I agree with you 1 00%.
I think if someone's got AlDS
and someone
wants to take a drug,
it's their life,
and if it gives them hope,
they ought to be able
to take it.
What I want to ask you
is whether you know
of anything
that you think might be
some kind of miraculous cure
that you think
they're sitting on at FDA.
- There are over 1 40 drugs
out there
that the FDA has identified
as possibilities
and are in some stage
of being looked at right now.
- Why are they holding back?
- Among that 1 40,
there's got to be one
or a combination thereof
that canÜÜÜÜÜ
that can slow down this virus
or halt it in its tracks.
- You're just simply
carrying the virus.
Is that correct?
- I have a few
very minor symptoms,
and my immune system
is virtually shot.
- What would you
like to take?
- I would like to be able to
take dextran sulfate legally.
- How would that hurt you?
- I'm taking it
on the underground right now.
- Well, why not, Mr. Braden?
- BecauseÜÜÜÜÜ
well, I don't know anything
about dextran sulfate.
- Well, I'll tell you this.
It's an over-the-counter drug
in Japan
and has been for 20 years.
- ButÜÜÜÜÜ
- Over-the-counter, yes.
- But if the FDA saysÜÜÜÜ
- I'm only asking
that they be released
after there's a minimal amount
of efficacy,
not a 1 00% test.
- You've got the pink triangle
on your shirt,
"Silence equals death."
I gather that means
you're a homosexual.
- Yes.
- Looking in the camera,
what would you tell some kidÜÜÜÜ
say you had a younger brother,
21 years old,
who also might
have homosexual tendencies;
what would you tell him
if you wanted him
to live a long life?
- Use a condom
and also to use a lubricant,
by the way,
that has the medicineÜÜÜÜÜ
- This is Russian roulette.
- It is not Russian roulette.
It is Russian roulette to
not give people this information
when human nature dictates
that they're gonna go out there,
and they're gonna have sex.
- You mean
celibacy is impossible?
- It's just not gonna work.
People aren't gonna do it,
and lotsÜÜÜÜÜ
Iots of people
are gonna die.
Now, would you rather have
a lot of people
cheating on their celibacy
with thousands of people
dying,
or would you rather
save those lives
and let them have sex?
- I think that, uhÜÜÜÜ
Well, thank you very much,
Peter Staley.
Thanks for being
in our studio.
Mr. Braden and l
will be back in a minute.
- One of the things
we wanted
was a drug
that you gave to people
who had cytomegalovirus
and advanced AlDS,
because people who had both
tended to go blind.
It was called DHPG.

In a way similar to AZT,
it was highly toxic,
but it was known
to be effective
because 6,000 people
had already used the drug
but never in a clinical trial.
crowd: Hey, hey, FDA!
How many people
did you kill today?
- We are with Jim Eigo
from ACT UP,
and there's a major protest
going on here in Bethesda
over the drug DHPG.
Tell us what's happening.
- Well,
this is the second meeting
of the Bush commission
for reviewing procedures
for approving AlDS
and cancer drugs.
And we thought,
since the non-approval of DHPG
is such a perfect example
of how regulation
has gone wrong,
we'd bring it home
to the commission itself
by showing up here in force,
and that's what we've done.
- Okay, also inside
at the hearing itself.
And I understand
there's going to be
an action
in just a little while
when Ellen Cooper speaks.
- I guess so.
- What about DHPG?
- What about DHPG?
- What about DHPG?
[overlapping voices]
- Without the objective data,
we feel that we would indeed
be onÜÜÜÜÜ
on treacherous grounds
in defending that decision
and, in fact,
would be wide open
to the charge of arbitrary
decision-making.
Although, uh, we certainly
wouldn't be accused
of being inflexible.
- You did it with AZT.
I don't see
why you can't do it with...
- I mean, I have to say
that the difference
in the data
between AZT And DHPG
is the difference between
night and day, as far asÜÜÜÜ
- Sight and blindness.
- You're just as blindÜÜÜÜ
- Lose your life
and lose your sight.
- People have died
since this meeting started,
and four more are gonna die
before it's over.
- Who represents the patient
on this panel?
- Where is a person of color
on this panel?
- FDA relooks at the DHPG data
and suddenly, "Oh!"
Agrees with ACT UP.
- Ready for a vote?
All in favor,
raise your hand.
One, two...
Well, that's everyone.
[cheers and applause]
- It was really
an amazing encounter,
but it sort of felt like
reaching the Wizard of Oz.
Like, you got to the center
of the wholeÜÜÜÜÜ
of the whole system,
and there's just this schmuck
behind a curtain.
There was no guiding agenda.
There was no leadership.
There was no global strategy
for how to deal with AlDS
in the U.S.
And so on the bus
back from Bethesda,
we decided
to write a treatment agenda,
because nobody was dealing
with the entire map of AlDS,
the entire constellation
of opportunistic infections,
the gaps in research,
the underrepresented
populations,
the fact that the diseases
and the drugs
might be different
in those populations.
How would we ever find out?
They weren't even being studied.
[carefree music]
- Jump on the bus!
- ? In the dark of night ?
? I laid myself ?
? To rest ?
? Step out of the strange... ?
- Bye, Ron!
Bye, Bobby!
- Come on, Catherine,
let's go.
- It's time to go.
- Yeah.
? ?
- ? Again ?
? Come to life ?
crowd:
Crisis knows no borders!
The AlDS crisis
knows no borders!
The AlDS crisis
knows no borders!
The AlDS crisis
knows no borders!
The AlDS crisis
knows no borders!
The AlDS crisis
knows no borders!
- I'd just like to say
that the reasons
I can't get any of these drugs
is 'cause,
for nine years now,
the leadership
in this country
has failed to come up
with a plan of action.
They've failed to come up with
a plan of research,
a national research agenda.
People with AlDS
and their advocates
have finally done this
for them.
This is it.
This is the plan
we're presenting.
We need our government
to read this plan.
We need them
to work with us.
If they want to change it
a little,
we'll talk to them.
But I want them to adopt it.
I want them
to get started on it.
I want them to save our lives.
Thank you.
[applause]
- I snuck around
and grabbedÜÜÜÜ
uh, grabbed
one of those copies.
And it was very interesting.
- We believe that
the United States
has a global responsibility
to quickly develop
effective treatments
not only
for HlV infection itself
but for all of
the opportunistic infections,
which actually
cause suffering and death
in people living with AlDS.
- This is not a new agenda,
and it is not an agenda
of only ACT UP.
Scientists agree with this.
Why can't we have it?
- The researchers
and regulators
are going to have to
come up with
a parallel release program
that will get drugs
to the people who need it
before the five years
down the pipe
where they may be approved
by the FDA.
- I was scribbling madly
in this copy of theirÜÜÜÜ
their AlDS Treatment
Research Agenda.
I would go back and forth
between saying, "No, no!
They don't understand!"
To saying,
"Whoa, you mean
"this isn't the way
we're doing trials?
You mean people aren't allowed
to do this or that?"
But I have to tell you
that I was still not ready
to sort of go up to them
and tryÜÜÜÜ
try and engage.
I brought this copy back,
and I distributed it to
a small group of statisticians
that was meeting regularly
to talk about
trial design issues.
The people sitting
around that table
got as excited as I did.
This had clearly been written
by people
who were very knowledgeable,
very, very intelligent,
and really wanted
to do the trials
the best possible way.
They were not against trials.
They wanted
to get the right answers,
but they wanted
what they called humane trials.
- It all came together
in Montreal,
but what was new
for ACT UP...
We went to a drug company.
- There is renewed hope
for people infected with AlDS.
A new experimental drug, ddl,
will be distributed
on a limited basis
for free this fall
by its developer,
the giant
Bristol-Myers company.
This marks the first time
an anti-AlDS drug
will be available
even before safety testing
is finished.
Full AZT treatment is too much
for patient Peter Staley.
For nine months,
he's been limited
to a quarter-dose of the drug
and wants ddl
as soon as possible.
- Do you need ddl to live,
do you think?
- Yes, I needÜÜÜÜ
I need ddl.
I probably need some other
antivirals beyond that.
- It is historic.
It is because
the AlDS activist community
has obtained this drug.
It is not the government.
No one has given it to us.
We have fought for it,
and for the first time,
we have won.
[indistinct chanting]
- So by '89, less than a year
after our FDA demo,
they had approved a drug
to prevent blindness
in people with AlDS.
And we had gotten
expanded access to ddl,
and that was
a very powerful feeling.
We felt like
we were taking direct action,
and we were helping
make people's lives better.
I wasn't sure that AZT or ddl
were all that great,
but we were beginning
to get letters from people
that said, "Thank you
for saving my eyesight."
"Thank you, ACT UP,
for getting me access to ddl
and helping to save my life."
- At Merck, HlV was an important
scientific target.
HlV, of course, is a virus.
In order for the virus
to infect an uninfected cell,
it needs to construct itself
in a particular way.
First, the viral RNA
needs to transform itself
into a DNA copy
in order to knit itself
into the nuclear DNA
of the newly infected cell.
This occurs by a process
called reverse transcription.
AZT and ddl were both
originally developed
to try to inhibit that process
of establishing infection.
A number of other researchers
began to focus on
another portion
of the viral life cycle:
after the cell
is already infected.
One of the steps
that it takes is thatÜÜÜÜÜ
is, it makes a viral protein.
It has to snip
that viral protein
in very specific places.
The resulting pieces
self-assemble
to make the viral particle.
And what does the snipping
and what in fact
controls the snipping
is a viral protein
called the protease.
If you genetically modify
the viral protease
so that
it can no longer snip,
the virus no longer
has the ability
to make those component pieces
that it needs to make
in order to self-assemble
and make
an infectious viral particle.
- We solved the structure
of HlV protease in 1 989
and published it
pretty quickly.
I thinkÜÜÜÜÜ
I think we saw the structure,
and within a few weeks,
it was in the literature.
- And then the question
became,
"All right,
can we prove it?"
Can we prove it that
that is, in fact, the case?
And most importantly,
can we prove that
if you inhibit that protease,
if you knock out
its activity,
that the virus
can no longer replicate
and therefore
make new progeny viral particles
that would then go on
and establish
a new cycle of infection?
[heartbeat thumping]
- AlDS is now
the leading cause of death
for men under 44
in New York
and a half dozen other cities,
surpassing homicide
and all other diseases.
Yet Roman Catholic bishops
are meeting this week
to publicly oppose
the use of condoms
as morally unacceptable.
This puts them
in direct opposition
to U.S. public health policy.
- The new church position
condemns not only
the immorality of condoms
but their effectiveness
as well.
The draft under consideration
in Baltimore this week
says it is,
"A virtual certainty
"that reliance on condoms
will result
in transmission of AlDS. "
Of the bishop's
proposed new policy,
New York City health
commissioner Stephen Joseph
says...
- This would be
a public health disaster.
It would undoubtedly
lead to more transmission,
particularly in high-risk areas
of the city,
more disease and more death.
- Catholic conservatives say
not just physical death
but spiritual death
is at issue here.
As New York City's
archbishop,
John Cardinal O'Connor
put it...
- The use of prophylactics
is immoral
in a pluralistic society
or any other society.
- I think that's it, except,
of course,
we have Ann Northrop
giving her sound bite
technique.
[cheers and applause]
- Uh, we want everybody
to join us,
to support us,
to destroy the power
of the Catholic Church,
to make our side
the strong one.
And to do that,
we must put out the message
that we are the ones
who are fighting
for people's lives,
and they are the murderers.
Don't be afraid of the media.
You're talking through them
to the public.
We are trying to arouse,
to anger an action.
And hone it down to, yes,
a three-second bite,
a five-second bite,
just a phrase
that will have an impact,
that will say something
specific
and that will be
understandable.
So...
[laughter and applause]
- Thanks for the advice.
- I don't have
a phrase worked out,
and so you're all
gonna have to create your own,
so this is empowerment.
[laughter]
- Act up!
Act up!
[chanting indistinctly]
- ? Answer me ?
? Sweet Jesus ?
? Won't you help me? ?
- Please,
you're interfering with us.
Step back.
- This is Jesus Christ.
I'm in front of St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Sunday.
We're here reporting on
a major AlDS activist
and abortion-rights activist
demonstration,
which will be taking place here
all morning.
Inside, Cardinal O'Connor
is busy spreading his lies
and rumors
about the position
of lesbians and gays.
We're here to say
we want to go to heaven too.
- J.C. here with
the Fire and Brimstone Network,
and we'd like to ask you
a little bit
about this large vision
that you've visited upon us.
- Well, we've decided
to rename the cardinal.
He's now Cardinal O'Condom.
This is our message to him
that condoms are safe.
It's no sin.
[crowd shouting]
[whistle blows,
people murmuring]
- Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!
We're not gonna take it
anymore!
You're killing us!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
crowd: Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
[organ music playing]
- How many more have to die?
How many more have to die?
Saving lives
is morally right!
- Those protesting
believe that
the protests will result
in some change of environment,
some change of attitudes,
perhaps.
The church will be teaching
that homosexual activity
is sinful,
until the end of time.
That won't change.
[carefree music]
[camera clicks]
? ?
- This is July 22, 1 989.
Now, Sara,
what do you think
about your dad being 44?
- Good.
[laughter]
- Thank you.
Thank you for your support.
One, two, three.
Yay!
[applauding]
We did it.
A lot of smoke.
- Oh, boy.
- I wish those candles
would stop smoking.
It's bad for their health.
- That's right.
Okay, Robert Rafsky,
do you have any remarks
before you jump off
the edge of the porch?
- I have no interest in jumping
off the edge of the porch.
I will jump up and down.
I think 44
is a very fine age.
It has a nice symmetry
to it.
It has a nice feeling
to it.
It's, uh, better than 22
and possibly better than 88.
We'll see.
- [laughs]
- Here's how we planned this.
What we want to do
is run this like
a Treatment and Data meeting.
A number of times,
we've had people
come to
a Treatment and Data meeting
and speak on certain issues.
We try to get in depth.
We try to nail issues down.
This isn't a free-for-all.
Let's call it
a working confrontation.
So why don't we start?
This is Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Bob Rafsky.
- I may be wrong,
Dr. Fauci,
but it's my understanding
that thousands of people
died from pneumonia
because there was no priority
within the government
or within the medical system
as a whole
to push the known
preventative treatments
for a long time.
Now, those thousands of people
are dead.
It would seem to me
that someone
who was within the government
while that took place,
as you were,
must have on their conscience
these deaths.
- That is a tough one, um...
[audience exclaims]
No, it really is.
It's inexcusable
that an academic priority
should ever, ever
come before
the health of the people
that you're working with.
There's no question
about that.
But the reality
of the situation is,
there was a great reluctance
among the community
of everything
from the scientists
to the Congress
saying that
what we should be doing
is not telling investigators
what to do,
but we should allow them
to do
what they feel
is the most important.
Now, that sounds awful
when you're putting it
in the context
of what we're talking about
here,
but the whole world
isn't in this room.
crowd: Every 1 2 minutes,
someone dies!
Protests won me a Nobel Prize!
Every 1 2 minutes,
someone dies!
[chanting continues
indistinctly]
- AlDS activists
stormed the government's
premiere disease research
center.
The National
lnstitutes of Health
is where an AlDS cure
might be found.
It is where therapies
are being tested
in clinical trials.
crowd: No more
secret meetings!
No more secret...
- Demonstrators
blocked access to buildings.
Scientists and administrators
reporting to work
stood around
looking confused.
Activists charged
the Bush administration
with foot-dragging
on AlDS research.
