Don't you want kids?
Why? You taught me to do
everything with enthusiasm,
then what's the matter now, hero?
Not with that much enthusiasm.
I want kids.
Hey, it's 12:00.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Happy third anniversary, baby.
Third anniversary?
After the fifth,
is an extramarital affair allowed?
Do you want another one?
Baby?
- Baby, you okay?
- Just one sec.
Yes, sorry.
Baby, baby!
Baby.
It's called
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
HCM.
It's a genetic disease.
Anshika, your heart
is slowly stopping to function.
Her heart can stop anytime.
It has to be operated immediately.
Vivaan this is a complex procedure
and expensive as well.
Arranging money
won't be a problem for me, sir,
but will she be all right
after the surgery?
Don't worry but it won't be right
to delay the operation.
Let's get to it
as soon as possible.
How will we arrange Rs. 70 lakh?
Actually, the time has come
to ask for dowry from your father.
What rubbish!
Trust me.
I'll take care of it.
And here it comes.
Hey!
What happened, baby?
Why me, Vivaan?
Why is this happening to me?
I mean...
Why me?
Why us?
No one can answer this question.
And no matter how many times
you ask this to yourself,
you'll only arrive at a dead end.
And you are my warrior wife!
You are stronger than this.
Hey!
We have solved
many big problems together.
We'll get through this as well.
I am there with you.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Why?
Are you going to perform
the operation instead of the doctor?
Then for sure.
Not a bad idea.
Come on.
Open your mouth quickly.
No, no, no, Vivaan,
it tastes terrible.
Please, please...
Just for today
order a cheesecake for me, please.
I always wonder
why these cheesecakes
and chocolate cakes
aren't healthy.
Yes.
It would've been so amazing.
But, unfortunately, it's not.
Come on.
This is all we have for now.
Open your mouth.
Yuck…
It is terrible.
Here, here. Come here...
Nice.
Will we be all right?
We'll be all right.
Hi, Abbas.
No... no problem.
I understand.
Hi, Aashin.
Thank you.
This is the last page.
Here you go, Mr. Saxena.
The house is yours.
Is the possession next month
okay with you, Mr. Vivaan?
It's time.
Doctor?
The patient's smile is missing.
Can we get that fixed as well?
"I have heard that
In your heart"
"My name is written"
"Look into my eyes"
"There my dream is hidden"
"How do I tell you
How much I want you?"
"Take my heartbeat"
"If you need them"
"You'll be able to hear
My wishes in it"
Everything will be all right.
This is the beginning...
of the rest of our life.
I love you.
"Colours and life
Are always here to stay"
"Shade and sunlight Are
both part of life's journey"
"In these winds"
"There will be
Both of our fragrances"
"I'll walk behind you
Wherever you go"
"Heard that, in your fate
You and I are destined to meet"
"So if that happens
Then why be scared?"
"Let's see what happens"
"Before I die"
"Let me love you"
"Take my heartbeat
If you need them"
"You'll be able to hear
My wishes in it"
A little bit up.
Is it in the centre?
Yes. It's in the centre.
Yes, Dr. Sinha?
I will be there in 20 minutes.
Thank you.
If you're done with sex,
ask about your wife's health also.
The poor thing has been waiting
at the hospital for so long.
Yes, baby, we just got done.
Oh, my God! It was heaven.
Let me catch my breath.
Then I'll run to you.
I love you.
Saju, they've left the jail.
Hospital ETA 8 minutes.
Find out who's the officer-in-charge
this evening.
Madam, I am telling the truth.
I don't know anything.
It's madam's case.
You'll have to open your mouth.
Now, how much you want to get
beaten up till you talk is up to you.
Aanya.
How far?
What?
Aanya, you promised me,
that you'll be home by 6:30.
That's why I gave you permission
to go out.
Today, because of her daughter,
you will get screwed.
Oh, forget what Dad said!
Just shut up and listen to me now.
I want you home
in the next 10 minutes.
And after reaching home,
you'll call me using your dad's phone.
Got it?
I don't have so much time, Tyagi.
Madam, madam...
Your nuts will break
in the next 3 seconds.
Talk!
I will tell you.
I will tell you the complete truth.
Take his statement.
A patient is admitted in the ER
with a possible pacemaker failure.
His pulse is dropping rapidly.
He is Assistant Superintendent
Rakesh Jadhav of Arthur Road Jail.
Dr. Sinha,
it is very important for him
to be okay.
Sir, I cannot reveal any further,
but understand...
that it's a matter
of national security.
What do you think, Dr. Sinha?
He's...
He is going into bradycardia.
The pacemaker needs
to be reprogrammed or replaced.
There is no time to waste.
- The patient is sinking.
- Sir, I am telling you again
it's very important for him
to be okay. He cannot die.
Synchronise.
Three...
two...
one...
Three more hours to go.
Let's have some fun, yeah?
All right, guys.
Guard this with your life, Yuri.
If this goes,
we will be in a lot of trouble.
Is that clear?
Is that clear?
Yes, Captain.
Vivaan...
get some sweets.
Anshika can go home today itself.
She is absolutely fine.
Just one final check-up and
dressing for her stitches are left.
That's why she is here
in the day care and not in the room.
I am preparing
her discharge summary.
After that, you can take her home.
Only one thing.
For the next two weeks, there should
be no exertion at all. Okay?
Complete bed rest.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
All the best, Vivaan.
I will see you Wednesday
for the check-up. All right?
Hey, who are you people?
And what are you doing...
Is that an AK-47?
No, Grandpa.
Every fancy gun is not an AK-47.
This is MP5,
and it's only used by the Army.
Come on, Dad.
Zubin, stay right here.
Yes, Captain!
Best of luck, Grandpa.
Siya, the doctor is almost here.
She'll attend to you first.
Should I get something for you?
Hi, sexy.
Hi.
Dr. Sinha has said that you…
What?
Today...
you can go home with me!
Hospital.
Okay, listen.
As soon as we reach home,
the first thing we'll do is that
we will plan a restaurant
outing for one full week. Okay?
No, no, no.
Dr. Sinha has said
that, for two weeks,
you can't exert yourself.
Vivaan,
have you ever heard any doctor say
that "You are absolutely fine now."
"You can go out and play kabaddi."
We can play kabaddi.
You have such a one-track mind.
You only think of one thing.
Yes, I have a one-track mind.
I am your husband.
Okay, listen, meet my friend.
Aditya, this is Vivaan.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Your body looks solid, uncle.
Thank you..
How many days did it take?
"Days"? It took me 10 years.
Show me your muscles..
Wow...
It'll take you...
12 days to build it.
- Really, uncle?
- Yes.
Thank you.
So cute!
Who is this dangerous man
with such a cute boy?
That's Aditya's dad.
The home minister's security guard.
It is like Beauty with Beast.
By the way, people say
the same about us as well.
You don't look like a beast.
Have you seen your face?
Be grateful to God
that you've got a hot wife like me.
Okay, listen,
I'll pay the bill and come back.
And you...
don't jump on the bed.
And miss me a lot.
I'll try.
I'll be back soon.
I love you.
Hey! Who are you?
Hello! Who are you?
- One minute.
- Hey!
Hey! ID show.
Show your ID. Who are you?
Show your ID.
We're in.
Network jammer in place.
All security systems disabled.
Good. Sitrep?
9th floor, 12 guards.
Armed with automatic weapons.
Stairs?
Clear.
Command centre now, copy?
This is command centre.
Good, copy.
- Ground team in position?
- Yes, Captain.
Ready to go in…
Ten...
nine...
eight...
seven...
six...
five...
four...
three...
two...
Time to tango.
Run, run!
Move fast, you, over there!
Hey, go. Hey, you wanna die? Move!
Sending hostages to lobby.
Do you want to make a call?
Send a message to your family? Huh?
There is no network.
What was that sound, buddy?
One minute.
Mr. Jadhav,
Had taken my security, there wouldn't
have been a situation like this.
9th floor under control. New UID?
Got it.
This hospital's security system
is a joke.
Cracked in less than a minute.
You're right. It does suck.
What should we do with you,
Mr. Jadhav?
Baby, listen.
I have no network on my phone,
and I don't know what's going on.
There has been some firing here,
but I am fine.
You please keep
your MMA coach spirit within you,
and don't try to be a hero, okay?
Just stay safe and stay low.
I will try again
after sometime, okay?
I love you. Bye.
I will call you.
Did you come to know anything?
All lines are dead.
If I reach home late,
my son throws a fit.
Hey, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Okay? Are you fine?
Fine, okay.
Relax, breathe, breathe,
Nothing will happen.
I will be back, okay? Relax.
Take care of him.
Get up, everyone.
Clear the room.
Move. I said move!
Sir, sir, sir, please.
Look, not everyone
is in a condition to walk.
Not in a condition to walk?
Sister, if they don't clear
the room immediately,
I will turn this ward
into a morgue. Understood?
- But, sir...
- I said quick!
Sir, sir, sir,
please, please, please.
Those who can walk
will listen to your orders.
But some of the patients are
not even in a condition to get up.
If you want,
you can see it for yourself.
I think you have enough hostages.
A fewer number of people
shouldn't make a difference.
Please understand, sir. Please.
Baby, listen carefully.
The hospital has been attacked.
You stay at the day care.
Don't move. I am coming to you.
I promise.
All right, guys, listen up!
I am going to say something
very important.
Please listen carefully.
I don't remember how many people
I have killed in my life,
and I don't want to use
any bullets today because...
our budget is very low.
We will quietly do our work
and leave.
Please don't disturb us.
All of you, stay where you are.
And don't try to increase
our budget.
He will bring
a black bag to you.
Kindly switch off your cell phones and
throw them in the bag. Is that understood?
Is that understood?
Up, up. Fast.
Take out your phones. Right now!
No time to waste.
Where is your phone?
Here. Phones in.
Come on. Move!
Quickly... We don't have time.
Everybody, fast.
Quick, quick.
Just like in films, the police
will arrive only in the end.
My mother is inside. She's diabetic.
She can't even walk properly, sir.
My wife and son are inside.
Please, please.
But with due respect, sir,
why is the home minister
calling you?
We know our job. We are
the Mumbai Police, for God's sake!
Okay, sir.
I will inform you.
Jai Hind!
Put your hands up and
stand straight. Stand up.
Pull your shirt up.
How will I pull my shirt
with my hands up?
I can only do one thing at a time.
ID card.
Slowly, slowly.
No sudden moves.
I can't do normal moves right now,
let alone sudden moves.
This is my driver's license.
This is my Aadhar card.
This is the hospital ID card.
After showing these many documents,
the Indian Government
will give me a passport.
Are you here to give me a visa?
I've been working in this hospital
for the past 7 years.
My name is Riyaz Ahmed.
God promise, I am telling the truth.
Please have a little faith in humanity.
If I was with those gunmen,
I would have a gun too, right?
Do I look like Spider-Man?
And I wouldn't have put
my hand on your shoulder.
I would have directly
put a bullet in your head.
Instead, you should ask
how I know that
you are not with these gunmen.
How?
It's because you are also scared.
You have a gun in your hands,
but still...
This... Where did you
get this gun from?
From the basement.
One of his guys tried to kill me,
but I killed him
and picked up his bag.
Killed?
You're talking as if you have stolen
chocolates from a kid and run away.
Great.
I thought you were Mogambo.
But you turned out to be Rambo.
Ajay Pal Singh's pacemaker failed
approximately one hour ago.
That's why he was brought here
from Arthur Road Jail.
And, at the same time, some heavily
armed men captured the hospital.
This cannot be a coincidence.
Ajay Pal Singh.
A convicted arms dealer and
part of a very large weapons cartel.
For years, this cartel's been supplying
faulty weapons to the Indian Army.
Because of this,
we lost 18 of our soldiers in Leh.
He was arrested in Dubai
four months ago
and extradited to India.
He has been looting India
for many years.
But now he will not get away.
Now the government has changed,
and his political cover is over.
Through him,
the whole cartel can get arrested.
That's why he hired professionals
who could help him out of here.
Go through every clue in depth.
You'll surely find something.
I want all details.
Call records of the jail
from the past one month,
Ajay Singh's lawyers, managers,
agents, ex-employees, contacts,
who went to meet him,
everyone's details
and bank statements.
See if there are
any major transactions.
One more thing..
How did weapons enter the hospital?
I want details of every employee
and patient.
Ma'am, these people
are using network jammers.
For the past half an hour,
there is no signal on any phone.
Check radio frequencies.
It will take me sometime
to break it, but, ma'am, I am on it.
- Tyagi.
- Yes, ma'am.
Get the layout of the hospital
from BMC.
Drainage, sewer lines,
there will be some way to go in.
I want commandos
and bomb squads here.
Talk to Force One for snipers.
Remember won't allow Ajay Singh
to go out of here, and that...
is our top-most priority.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, ma'am!
Good.
Yes, Shiven.
Did Aanya reach home?
What? Wait.
Let me try her phone.
This is our fifth floor palace.
Apart from us,
only a patient's ghost comes here.
Only two people know
about every corner of this hospital.
The one who built it
and the other is me.
The first one is with the Lord now,
and I have no intentions
to go up for the next 40-50 years.
Wanna play Ludo?
Shall I send an invitation?
I want to go to the ninth floor.
How will you go? Lift or Stairs?
They haven't come with firecrackers.
They are very dangerous people.
If they catch you,
they won't show mercy.
I cannot wait any longer.
They'll soon get to know that
I have killed one of their men.
They will try everything
to kill me.
Before they reach me...
I will reach them.
Yes, that's a valid point.
First floor, CCTV room.
It is their eyes.
If you break that, then...
you'll have access to the entire floor
and you can strike them from anywhere.
And they won't even know.
Hush. Don't scream. Don't scream.
I am the good guy.
I am going to remove my hand.
Don't scream.
My name is Vivaan.
And you?
My name is Zubin,
and I have come here with
my grandfather and father, and...
we were on the ground floor
of this hospital...
Uncle, the safety on your gun is on.
The gun won't fire.
Do you know about guns?
Yes, this is an MP5.
It fires up to 700 rounds
per minute.
It is my favourite.
I know a safe place.
Will you come with me?
It's sweet.
Doesn't this have artificial sugar?
Hello?
Hello, Dr. Panjwani.
Why do you keep such useless things
in this hospital?
Shoot him.
Wait, wait...
It was a joke.
The police must've arrived by now.
It's time to say, "Good evening."
Doctor, is it necessary
to be within close range
to externally manipulate
the pacemaker?
- Yes, ma'am.
- It means someone went to jail
and manipulated his pacemaker
so that his heart problem worsens,
and he can come here,
and, from here, he can...
- Ma'am.
- Yeah?
You need to come with me.
ACP Jayati Bhargav!
ACP Jayati Bhargav!
I am ACP Jayati Bhargav.
This is ACP Jayati Bhargav.
Good evening, Mrs. Bhargav.
I'm so sorry you have to spend
your Friday night with us
instead of your family.
Who are you?
Come on. Let's cut this
whole negotiation manual bullshit.
First question: Who are you?
Second question: What do you want?
Come on, let's come
to the second question directly.
What do I want?
First and foremost,
your full cooperation.
I know that you are on duty,
and you are performing your duty
with honesty.
I also know that
your team is trying to come inside.
But just to save you time
and effort,
please do not try that. Please.
All entry and exits
have been booby-trapped
with plastic explosives.
Exactly like the one on the girl.
A little here and there and boom.
The girl goes straight up.
About the rest,
you are a smart person.
Isn't it, Mrs. Bhargav?
Nothing is going to happen.
You have my assurance.
Assurance?
Are you in a position
to give assurance?
You just take orders.
At 2200 hours,
an MI8 chopper on the terrace
and a 20-seater bus with
tinted glasses at the main gate.
Two escort vehicles.
If you do all this,
nothing will happen
to the hostages.
I am giving you...
an assurance.
Okay, but to arrange all this,
it will take some time.
Hey, madam, even cell phone software
gets updated from time to time,
but not your old police excuses.
Listen, madam.
If the chopper and bus
don't come on time,
then your Green Hills Hospital has
3 entry gates and 4 drainage pipes.
You'll find so many corpses there
the entire police force won't
be able to count them. Understood?
- You, move!
- Move.
- Move back.
- Tyagi, don't fire!
I said inside. Come.
Don't worry, dear.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Go.
Chad, we have an uninvited guest
in the building.
Just see the CCTV footage
and find that bastard.
I think we'll go over our budget.
Zubin, are you ready
to kill bad guys?
I was born ready, uncle.
Max, MRI room.
Far-left corner of the corridor.
Zubin!
Zubin!
I want snipers on these 2 buildings,
but only to observe and report.
We may get to know something
about that firing.
And tell the bomb squad to suit up.
- We will surprise them.
- Okay, ma'am.
No one should know
that it was Aanya back there,
or else they will remove me
from the case.
Yes, ma'am. Ma'am..
We will not let anything happen
to baby.
Captain?
Yes, Pasha?
Max is dead.
And...
- And?
- Yuri also.
We found his body.
And the black pouch?
It's not here. It's gone
along with Yuri's bag.
Then search for him.
I don't know how,
but search for him.
When you find him,
remove his eyes
so that he never tries to take
someone else's stuff.
Find that bastard
and that black pouch.
When we find him...
I will kill him.
Yes.
You and only you will kill him,
but you need to find
that black pouch first.
Chad, just check the basement footage,
18:45 onwards.
Locate him. Identify him.
- Copy that, Captain.
- You have 10 minutes.
This is the bomb's
remote detonator.
It's used to set off the bomb
from a range.
You know so much
about guns and bullets.
Do you know the table of 13?
Recite it.
The what, uncle?
You will surely grow up
to be a terrorist.
Don't call me uncle again.
Where to now?
What are you doing?
Good evening!
Dr. Sinha.
I want to meet Ajay Pal Singh.
He is out of danger now, but...
he won't gain consciousness
for an hour.
One hour?
What do you mean?
- In local anaesthesia...
- Not local. General.
But who are you?
What is happening here?
Raman.
General anaesthesia.
Means everything is delayed
by one hour.
What about our exit plan?
Nothing will happen, Raman.
Don't worry. Relax.
Say, we leave
at 11 o clock from here.
At 11:05, blow up parking
and the main gate.
By the time the police catch up,
we'll reach Versova in 17 minutes.
We'll take a boat and
reach the ship at 11:52 p.m.
- 11:52?
- 11:52.
Here the cops will search for us,
and there we will be out of India.
Just shift the whole plan
by one hour.
Saju, the helicopter and bus
we've demanded is for 10 o'clock.
We can't change that!
We don't have to change that.
That is supposed to reach late.
And, according to our new schedule,
the chopper and bus that we need,
even their fathers will get them
to us.
Or else, what?
We should shoot some hostages.
Simple.
Chad, I meant 10 minutes,
not 50.
Just a minute, Captain.
Captain, his name is Vivaan Ahuja.
He's an MMA trainer.
He's definitely here for someone.
Look for patients
with surname "Ahuja."
Copy.
Vivaan Ahuja.
I know you can hear me.
In sometime, I'll find your relative
and my black pouch.
I also know that you have killed
two of my men.
But I will not kill your relative.
I'll just give them
five little cuts.
Gradually,
they'll start losing blood.
And then gradually their life.
Death by five cuts.
I want to listen this.
Yes, ma'am.
Hello. I'm hardly getting a signal.
Please make me speak
to ACP Jayati Bhargav.
Patch him.
This is ACP Jayati Bhargav.
Who is speaking?
Ma'am, I cannot tell you my name,
but please tell me...
Listen, whoever you are,
how can I trust you?
- Who knows if you are also...
- If you don't want to trust me, don't.
But we have very little time.
They'll kill all the patients.
Please tell me if you are planning
something or not.
I can't share that information
with you. What more can you tell me?
Two sets of hostages.
One on the ground floor lobby
and the second on the ninth floor.
They are communicating
through walkie-talkies.
One of them even shot at me.
At that time, you weren't
communicating with them.
Maybe he saw the gun in my hand.
How did you get a gun?
They had a man named Yuri
who met me in the basement
and tried to kill me.
And I killed him, ma'am.
His... Hello?
Hello? Shit, shit.
Damn!
If the network jammers are active,
how did he get a signal?
Ma'am, even if the network jammers
are active,
then away from its range,
in a corner or somewhere,
you can get a stray signal.
It's completely possible.
Or maybe he is with them.
Sabir, load the layout of the lobby
and the 9th floor on the screen now.
- Tyagi.
- Yes, ma'am.
Tell Atul to get
his commandos ready. Now!
I cannot wait
for the police to take action.
To save Anshika,
I'll have to fight them myself.
No, I won't be able to lift that.
I still have a little pain
in my shoulder.
Go, my brother.
Allah will protect you.
Hi, baby.
Listen, I am fine, safe.
I am on the ninth floor.
You also stay where you are.
And please keep extra
sugar sachets with you, okay?
Just stay safe. I'll see you soon.
I love you. Bye.
Look who we have here!
Captain Mumbai.
Saviour of Green Hills!
Found him.
Black pouch?
- Negative, Saju.
- Get him up here.
I will take his eyes out.
I know, Taira.
You want to kill him right away.
But we need the detonators.
No detonators, no explosion,
no surprise.
- Understood?
- Okay.
Get up.
You're too close.
What?
Forget the gun. Go!
- The bastard escaped.
- Taira, stop complaining.
Find him and bring him to me.
Taira?
Jesper?
Jesper!
- Where are you going, Raman?
- Saju, they are useless.
We will have to go down.
What do you think?
I cannot go down?
Yes?
This floor is our command post,
Raman.
And, according to the plan,
we can't leave it.
- Saju, that...
- Vivaan will die.
Vivaan will die.
This is Saju's promise.
Now, listen up, everyone.
Find Vivaan and bring him up to me.
I will increase everyone's share
by 15%.
He's going to the first floor.
No!
Guys, come in.
Guys, come in!
Get back! Get back!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me.
Help me!
Vivaan.
Vivaan.
Please save me.
I don't want to die.
You had promised me
that you will protect me.
Save me, Vivaan!
Get up, Vivaan!
Save me!
Get up!
Oh! Vivaan uncle!
Take it easy, brother.
What did you switch off, Zubin?
This is the network jammer, uncle.
I switched it off.
Well done, Spider-Man.
Shit, shit...
Vivaan, Vivaan...
Listen, listen. Listen to me.
They haven't called from the 9th floor.
It means the photo hasn't reached him.
Calm down and think.
Get back to your senses, brother.
Brother, if your love affair
is done, shall we go ahead?
Hey, Vivaan!
Look at the ground floor.
Hey, hey, hey. Shut up!
I said shut up, or I'll shoot you.
Zubin..
Sir.
They said that, if I move
even little away from the door,
both the door and vest
will blow up.
You are so brave.
Don't lose hope.
All this will be over soon,
and we'll all go back to our homes.
We are one team.
Sir, my mom...
What?
No, sir, nothing.
Who is here with Vivaan Ahuja?
Who is it?
You?
You?
Johnny, Johnny.
Yes, Papa.
Eating sugar?
No, Papa.
Telling a lie.
No, Papa.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
I don't know.
Ha-ha-ha!
Who is here with Vivaan Ahuja?
Ma'am, we are getting a call
from the same number.
Patch him.
Hello?
Ma'am, CCTV room and lobby
are under our control now.
The name of their boss is Saju.
Captain Saju.
He is on the 9th floor,
and he is giving orders from there.
Nine of their people are dead.
Nine?
You killed them? Alone?
Even if they were 90,
I would have killed them.
Why are you doing all this, Vivaan?
I don't have a choice.
I have to always fight
my own battles.
And, ma'am,
if you had someone inside,
wouldn't you do it as well?
- Just be careful.
- Yes, ma'am.
We have eyes on their movements.
We are ready.
Please check who this Saju is.
Ex-forces, international mercenaries,
court-martialled officers, anything!
Ma'am, why are we waiting now?
- Let's go inside.
- Wait.
Tell Atul that I want thermal scans
of the building.
Check everything.
Don't rush at all.
Now we don't have to worry
about the CCTV cameras.
- We can plan better and quicker.
- Okay, ma'am.
Sabir, can you show me
the CCTV feed of the lobby?
- Now.
- Yes, ma'am.
Have you heard the name
Vivaan Ahuja?
When?
5 minutes ago and now.
Both times from you.
Anything else?
Or should I leave?
Thank you for the chocolate, uncle.
And I am a big fan of Bhai.
And Salman Khan never bends
in front of a villain.
Understood?
I shouldn't have done your dressing.
You've made it a regular thing now.
What do I do? Your hand
has a mother's love hidden in it.
I am glad
it's not girlfriend's love.
Mr. Vivaan Ahuja.
You think you will become a hero
after killing everyone.
Take this.
Someone wants to talk to you.
- Anuradha.
- Sorry what?
Anuradha.
Tell me something
about yourself, Anuradha.
I am the head nurse at Green Hills.
I have been working here...
for five years.
Who all are there in your family?
My... my son
and my mom.
My husband passed away
two years ago.
I am so sorry.
So many responsibilities
on one person.
What if?
What if I kill you?
What will happen?
Please... please.
My son won't be able
to live without me.
He has no one else other than me.
It's okay. It's okay.
I was just asking you.
I am so sorry.
You like playing with death, Vivaan,
don't you?
Now I will show you what death is!
If you don't come up with
the black pouch within 10 minutes,
I will start throwing hostages
one by one.
Understood?
Stop hiding like a coward.
Come down if you have the guts.
I am calm right now
so nine of your people are dead.
If I get angry, see what...
"Angry."
Nice word.
I am waiting for you
on the ninth floor.
Come and show us your anger.
Sure. Don't complain later
that I didn't warn you.
Shut up!
Shut up, everyone!
What's wrong? What happened?
He tried to snatch my gun.
Shut him up.
Shut him up.
Make him quite!
- Shut him up I say...
- Hey!
What then?
Will you kill me?
Go ahead.
After me, kill this child.
Then...
that uncle.
One by one kill everybody.
What else can you do?
Poor Anuradha..
What did she do to you?
Even then.
You bloody scum!
Make him quite.
Next time, I'll give a bullet
instead of a chocolate.
Come on, Raman.
Vivaan, this is Jayati.
Just tell me what's this black pouch
that Saju wants so badly.
Ma'am, it's a remote detonator.
It's a very important part
of their exit plan.
Ma'am, who are these people?
And what do they want?
Ajay Pal Singh.
An arms dealer whose operation
has happened on the ninth floor.
His pacemaker was manipulated
to bring him to hospital from jail.
- Manipulate?
- Yes, manipulate.
Every pacemaker
has an eight-digit UID number.
If you know that, you can manipulate it
from a distance. They did exactly that.
The moment I grab Ajay Pal Singh,
this entire drama will be over.
Ma'am... I will call you
in a second.
Vivaan!
Every pacemaker
has an eight-digit UID number.
How much time?
Only 20 minutes more.
Saju.
Is it your lucky day?
You won the lottery.
And lottery's number is PN48745326.
Understood?
Ajay Singh's new pacemaker's UID.
If the pacemaker
can be manipulated once,
it can be done
a second time also, right?
It's even in my range now.
You gave me 10 minutes.
I give you 5 minutes...
to surrender.
You are not worthy of living,
but I will allow you to live.
And one more thing.
For whom I am doing all this,
he has reached me.
I am done.
Now you see yours.
But with caution.
It's Ajay Singh's life after all.
Who is he?
How does he have my...
UID number?
Give him some money
and silence him.
I will give him Rs. 5-10 crore.
Silence him.
I will give him death,
not money.
Stay quite.
- Is there any other option?
- No, ma'am.
The way these IEDs are placed,
we can only dismantle them
from the inside.
Passenger relay is our only option.
Don't worry, ma'am.
This wiring is not so complicated.
With proper guidance,
we can dismantle them.
Bathroom.
Now?
Stop.
2 minutes. Go.
The number you have dialled
is either switched off
or outside the coverage area.
Please try again...
You couldn't stop yourself
from becoming a hero, huh?
But well played.
Impressive.
After all, you are my husband.
Baby, please just be safe.
Okay, listen.
Once all this is over...
we'll go back to Goa.
We will get a house there.
By the beach.
And we'll make lots of babies.
So many.
We'll also adopt a few.
Yeah.
But I will not cook.
You will have to learn.
And no extramarital affair.
Never.
At least till the time I am alive.
Just a sec!
Bye. I love you. Bye.
Vivaan Ahuja,
you are thinking of manipulating
the pacemaker, right?
Do it.
If Ajay Singh dies,
I'll kill each hostage with a speed
of 700 rounds per minute.
What difference does that make to you?
There is no relative of yours here.
A pawn doesn't have the power
to defeat the king.
If you would have found
your relative here,
you would not be worrying
about the UID number.
You would think
of getting out of here.
But it's okay. Nice try.
Now listen to me.
You have 5 minutes.
- What's your name, uncle?
- My name...
What difference does it make?
After this, I will not think.
I will start killing. Understood?
The last 15 minutes of your life
have started.
Go. Start the countdown.
Vic,
clean it up.
I don't like bloodstains.
Vivaan, think it over again.
Anshika is upstairs with him.
There's nothing else to think.
I don't have anyone in my life
except her.
Either I will take her along...
or else I die with her.
What? What is this?
These are Force One badges.
Get ready for a new life, Ajay.
You knew he was bluffing.
The scars on my face
are there for a reason.
What if Vivaan doesn't come
in 5 minutes?
He will definitely come.
But we just lost
an element of surprise.
We don't have time.
We move to Plan B.
Looking at Ajay Singh's condition
right now,
Plan B would be risky.
If Plan B was not risky,
then it would be Plan A.
And Vivaan?
What do we do about him?
Will we let him go so easily?
We will admit him to the morgue
before leaving. Don't worry.
What's there on the sixth floor?
Nothing. It's under renovation.
If Saju doesn't take the lift
or the stairs,
can he reach the ground floor
or basement from the sixth floor?
Directly to the ground floor?
Yes, he can.
There is a laundry shaft,
which opens into the laundry room
in the basement.
If these people
manage to reach there,
they can easily escape from there.
Ma'am!
Ma'am, Vivaan.
Hello, Vivaan?
Ma'am, Saju's plan was never
to take the helicopter and the bus.
Poor Jayati Bhargav.
She will breach the lobby by sending
commandos via the staircase and lift,
thinking we are cornered.
They are going to explode
the staircase and lift.
We will welcome them with a bomb
at the staircase and lift.
He plans to reach the ground floor
or basement
through a laundry shaft
from the sixth floor.
Head to the sixth floor,
prepare for descent
from the laundry shaft,
and make sure no one
can reach the sixth floor, okay?
It's time to choose
our favourite hostages.
Are you sure about this, Vivaan?
What if you are wrong?
I can be wrong in life at times,
but not today.
Trust me.
You just get the lobby evacuated.
I will handle Saju.
He will definitely use
the laundry shaft...
but not alive.
Someone please come forward.
I will help that person.
We can't come inside,
so we need your help.
Do you people want to get out,
or do you want to die here?
Help us to help you.
Someone come forward.
We don't have time.
What, uncle? Without me?
Let's go.
No, stop, stop.
You'll grow up to be a commando.
Believe me.
What the hell were you doing here?
Mom...
actually...
Karan...
my boyfriend.
He is allergic to peanuts.
So, after school,
we were having lunch
and someone pranked us
and put peanuts in his food.
He could've died.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you would get angry.
I am sorry
I didn't tell you about it.
I'll never lie, Mom.
Sorry.
You informed them, right?
That you will not return.
Drop your gun.
Where is Saju?
Where is Saju?
Keep moving, keep moving.
Go ahead and see. Left, left.
Vivaan!
Cut it. Cut it.
Go that way. Go.
Gun!
Give me the gun!
Give me the gun! The gun!
Raman!
Vivaan!
Vivaan... Give me the gun.
How could I miss that, dude?
I made a big mistake
by not listening to you that time.
Better late than never.
Please, please.
Did you think your fighter attitude
will work here also?
Four months..
Four months we planned extensively.
Every step, every detail.
And guess what!
You came.
You made a big mistake.
Now you will see my anger.
Vivaan... Vivaan...
Vivaan!
Parma, shoot her!
No.
Anshika, don't you want kids?
Kids?
Vivaan!
Vivaan!
Anshika, let go!
No!
Let go!
No.
Trust me.
If I can make our country's
defence budget...
go up...
then think how much
I can give you people.
You won't be able to count.
Nothing will happen to me
because my people know
that, if anything happens to me,
then...
in two hours,
one file and everyone's names
will be out.
And all these big shots,
they won't let me die here
in this condition.
Soldiers join the army...
to die.
And I go for profit.
So, you are saying that,
if you die,
then everybody's name will be out
in two hours
with all the proof.
That's right.
Then why are you alive?
18 soldiers.
18 bullets.
Perfect justice.
And this one for my daughter.
Ajay Pal Singh down.
Ajay Pal Singh down.
He started firing first.
We didn't have any option.
We killed him.
And now we have a big news.
Ajay Pal Singh has died
in the hospital.
Yes, Ajay Pal Singh
has died in the hospital.
The Green Hills attack case
has taken a new turn.
The defence ministry
has received a file,
which sheds light
on the years' worth of corruption
in the purchase of firearms.
The death of 18 soldiers,
the purchase of faulty equipment
and now this attack,
all this has caused a stir
in the defence ministry.
The defence minister has said
that this was a plan
to weaken our nation's safety,
and has ordered an inquiry
with immediate effect.
It is being said that
a common Indian man named Vivaan
saved many lives
with his courage and bravery.
But it is not confirmed.
The hostage drama finally ends.
All the hostages are safe.
This well-planned assault...
as you can see,
all hostages are now safe.
The Green Hills Hospital attack
is a well-planned conspiracy
stemming from a corrupt mindset.
The roots of this conspiracy...
Vivaan, Jayati Bhargav.
- Hi, ma'am.
- Sit, sit.
Thank you for the last-minute tip.
It saved lives.
I mean...
The department should thank you.
They should give you a medal.
But I know that you don't want
your name given to the media.
It's your choice,
and we totally respect that.
We won't forget this.
Get well soon.
Thank you.
You have a good man here.
Good idea not taking his surname.
Smart choice.
It saved your life.
I know, ma'am.
But I think
he should take my surname now.
Maitra.
I leave the two of you to it.
- Take care Vivaan.
- Thank you.
- You too.
- Take care.
So...
Vivaan Maitra.
Oh, yes.
Your homecoming gift.
You got me a gift?
The box broke.
Thank you.
- Oh, listen.
- Very nice.
You sent me a voice message.
Was it anything urgent?
Hey, no!
Nothing urgent. Just...
it was a recipe for soup.
I have deleted it.
You did the right thing
by deleting it.
You know how good-looking I am.
And did you hear?
I am also very brave.
And if I become a good chef,
then think.
Think about all the girls.
This would happen.
Stupid.
Okay, listen.
I don't know when you are
going to get discharged.
But I am going home today.
Is it?
What will you do
at home without me?
What will you do?
What will I do here?
I will play kabaddi.
Without me? All by yourself?
"I just want to say
Only this much to you"
"I want to love you
In a way that the world sees"
"I want to be in so much love
We flow into each other"
"through friendship and companionship
We live and die with each other"
"Confessing is tough
Denying is tougher"
"It's hard to confess my love
To my lover"
"See how difficult it is
To love someone in this world"
"Oh, friend
To love someone"
"Oh, friend
To love someone"
"See how difficult it is
To love someone in this world"
"Oh, friend
To love someone"
"Oh, friend..."
"Look"
"Look"
"We've seen always
Love makes one go crazy"
Every single breath
Injures the heart"
"Sleep, peace and life
All get entangled"
"Being a friend of love
The heart becomes its own enemy"
"Some say that love is disaster"
"Some say that love is heaven"
"Some say it's a bad addiction
Some say it's a good habit"
"Trusting is tough
Sacrificing is tougher"
"It's hard to confess my love
To my lover"
"See how difficult it is
To love someone in this world"
"Oh, friend
To love someone"
"Oh, friend..."
"Look"
"Look"
"Look"
"Look"
