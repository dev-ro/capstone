Hey Mom?
Yeah?
What sound did
the drum kit make
as it fell down the metal?
I have no idea.
Ba-dum-tschh.
You're funny.
Thank you.
We'll have to tell that one
to your dad.
He'll like that.
They always win.
They don't always win.
Are you nervous.
Maybe I just thought
this year would be different.
Honey.
Sometimes we need to do things
that scare us, you know,
in order for us to grow.
Yeah.
Anyway, those are
new skates too, so...
I've gotta keep
doing it.
That's the spirit, kid.
...five push-ups!
Is she up?
She'd better be.
This is not a vacation.
She's trying, Philip.
She got kicked out of school.
It's not like she robbed
a bank or anything.
Morning Dad.
Morning Grace.
Morning, Lucy.
I'm running late.
Follow me for one of my
favourite features of the home
is this smoke marble island.
I mean, do you believe it?
After everything I've done
for her?
Have you told her
how you feel?
You think I could...
just say how
I really feel?
And we have two spare bedrooms
just off of the family room.
I'm sorry you feel so...
Empty?
There's no other word
to describe it.
Empty.
- Take care.
- Bye.
Letting someone go
is hard to do.
So it wasn't easy.
Six months doesn't
feel like a long time
to be with someone,
you know.
Well, it's long enough
to know
that Eric was not a healthy
relationship for you.
Yeah.
Every word that I said to him,
the stronger I felt.
Okay, good.
And why do you think that is?
Because of you.
I think you're giving me
too much credit.
I don't think I am,
Doctor Clark.
Okay.
There are things I'm probably
going to miss.
Okay.
Tell me about that.
How smart he is.
Charming and intuitive.
But the things I won't miss,
Oh, my god...
His rigidity, his inflexibility.
His constant need to just know
exactly what I was doing
and to be in control
of my life.
Okay, I'm sorry.
It's my fault, okay?
Like even being here,
seeing you,
this thing that I treasure
and this...
this thing that he knew
saved my life?
He hates psychiatry.
He said they're all charlatans
and frauds.
Really?
Yeah.
Look, I think you should be
really proud.
I mean, it's one thing
to face a hard truth
and it's another
to act on it.
Yeah.
I was thinking about
this summer.
What if we went to
British Columbia, huh?
Rent that place on the lake
that we all used to love?
Maybe.
Yeah, a family vacation
like we used to do.
Um, sorry, I'm...
just have got a lot
to catch up on.
Okay.
Hello, everybody.
We're joined today by the Dean
of this prestigious school,
Dr. Vanessa Fanning.
There she is.
Give her a round of applause.
Go on, Doctor Clark.
Thank you.
Um, there is a clinical case
study that I'd like to share
with you all today.
The patient's name,
we will call her Mary.
She's a 22 year-old female.
She's one of two siblings.
She came from a wealthy
west coast family.
She and her older brother
were raised on an estate
their paternal
grandfather built.
Her father struggled
with bipolar disorder,
her mother struggled
with depression.
And when Mary was 11 years old,
her mother took her own life.
Beginning in her freshman year
at college,
the patient made the first
of several suicide attempts.
When Mary began treatment
with me,
she was on three separate
psychotropic medications.
After spending 14 months in a
private psychiatric facility,
it was clear that we needed
a different approach,
and that standard therapy
was not going
to help this young woman
get her life back on track.
So...
I did something that
I have never done.
I stepped back from my usual
methodology as her doctor.
And I sat in that room
with her
as just another troubled
human being.
Someone who was flawed
and frightened.
Someone who was regretful,
someone who had experienced
trauma myself.
I told Mary my whole life story.
I told her things that I had
never told anyone else.
I told her things that
I had never told my wife.
I did this because I wanted
Mary to understand
that she wasn't alone, that her
despair wasn't foreign to me.
I wanted to take the cap of
shame off of her experience.
In four months, her
symptoms disappeared.
In six months, she was off
all of her medication.
And after 14 months,
she's been doing so well
that she's started to write
a book about her illness,
and she's taking charge
of her relationships.
At long last, Mary's life
is back on track.
That was a great lecture
you know.
Vanessa, I know
what you're thinking.
Look Philip, it's... it's great
that you've had this
breakthrough with your patient.
It's obviously affected you
in a positive way as well.
That is not what
you're thinking.
Come on.
Ethically, this is a grey area.
Sharing such personal
information with a patient.
Okay.
I'm just concerned about
your well-being as well as hers,
given everything your family's
been through.
We're fine. We're fine.
I do want to say I'd feel
more comfortable
if your patient would still
continue with her meds,
for the benefit of both
of you.
You're so old school.
Philip.
You're gonna have
to trust me.
All right.
- Okay.
- I will.
How are Lucy and Grace
doing now?
- They're okay.
- Good.
They're doing well.
I look forward to seeing
Grace tonight...
if we're still on.
Tonight, yeah.
If we're still on.
Okay. I'll see you later.
Hey Daphne.
Doctor Clark?
Yeah, what's up?
She's dead.
Joan.
My best friend, she...
Oh, no. Daphne...
She's dead.
Oh, my god.
What happened?
She was jogging
in Forest Park.
In Portland.
It was a hit and run.
Somebody hit her
with a car.
Okay.
Okay, listen to me.
She was killed.
Daphne, listen to me.
Look. I know what
you're afraid of.
I'm not like that anymore.
I just needed someone
to talk to.
Okay, because I can be there
in one hour if you need me to.
I know.
Look, I'm coming in tomorrow,
okay?
I'll see you then.
Okay.
But it's very important that you
do come in tomorrow.
You can't skip, okay?
And we're not going to call.
I need you to come in
to the office tomorrow,
and we'll take all the time
that you need.
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
...straight down the middle.
Total meatball.
Any other day,
Jordie crushes it.
Oh, my god.
He whiffs.
Great big wide swing and pfft,
game over.
That's good for him,
I think.
Oh, the poor baby.
Well, at least I was
smart enough
to keep my mouth shut in
the car on the way home.
And I credit you for that,
I do, hon.
Because some fathers
never stop
to put pressure
on their kids.
I was the worst
second baseman
in the history of the world.
Philip used to practice
his therapeutic skills
on the way home from hockey.
How did you feel about the game,
Evan?
Yeah.
What's she doing home?
Um...
Lucy was expelled.
What for?
Oh, just some cocaine.
Ah, classic teenage,
you know.
Please, can we not talk
about that right now?
You're right, let's never
get into it.
Dad?
It's the police.
What?
How can I help you?
She must have jumped
from up there.
We're still looking
for a suicide note.
UPS guy on his last run of
the day comes up the drive
and there she is.
Look man, I'm sorry
to drag you here,
but her phone had you listed
as the doctor to call
in case of emergency.
I understand.
No signs
of foul play,
no suspicious activity
reported by the neighbours.
No evidence to suggest
it was anything else, really.
Hey!
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, sir!
Why are you here?
Who are you?
I'm James Flagg, all right?
What's going on,
where's my sister?
There's been
an accident?
What? What?
Can I, can I, can I...
It's my sister...
Let us handle this.
I just want to go and see her.
Is she okay?
Is she okay?!
We'll take care of it!
Calm down! Fuck!
Try to calm down.
- Daphne! Daph!
- Take a breath.
Take a breath.
Fucking let me go!
Medic!
Daphne!
She's my sister!
She's my sister, please!
Hi, I'm...
I'm Philip Clark.
I was your sister's
psychiatrist.
And I... I know what you must
be going through,
and I'm very sorry.
I think there's
a curse on this family.
Nobody to rage at,
nobody to blame but us.
But me.
I'm the only one left now.
I knew she loved Joan,
and when she called,
I could hear the pain
in her voice.
But... she was calm.
So I... I didn't, I didn't feel
the need to rush up here
that instant, you know?
I, I, I, I, I...
You know what I did, I let
her slip through my fingers.
I just...
No, no. James.
She called me too.
I don't think there's anything
that could've been done.
That just isn't how it works.
You and me, eh?
Two strangers.
In this together.
Of course I'll cover
your classes, Philip.
It's... it's the least
I can do.
Thanks.
I feel like I've lost
my balance.
I'll just take a little time
and I'll get it back.
Philip, I'm... I'm here for you
to support you,
not to judge you,
you know that.
Yes.
You need to take a moment
to deal with what's happened
this time.
Please don't rush yourself.
Okay.
You know, losing a patient
is tough.
It's a bereavement, Philip.
Philip?
Philip?
Hi.
Hi.
Is um, is...
is Doctor Clark home?
Uh... yeah.
I have something for him.
Oh, uh, Dad?
Thank you.
He's just making a call.
- Um.
- Hi.
Sorry, how... how can I
help you?
We were just getting ready
to sit down and eat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Bad timing.
My name is James Flagg.
I'm the... I'm the brother
of his patient, who uh...
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
I'm going to go grab him.
Thank you very much.
Philip? Philip?
Hi.
Hey.
I'm sorry, I looked up your
address and I drove on over.
I wanted to return this,
which is yours.
Or at least,
your name's inside.
Been packing up the house,
you know.
Sifting through boxes.
I figured you'd lent it to her,
you might want it back.
I did.
Thank you.
Sorry you had to drive it
all the way over here.
No problem.
It's good to get out
of the house.
Anyway, I'll get back to it.
Okay.
James?
How are you doing?
Well, you know...
Not great.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Philip.
I'm just wondering if James
had... had dinner yet.
I don't know.
Would you like to join us?
He was just dropping off a book.
Yeah.
We've got Thai
and I ordered extra,
so we'd love to have you.
If you want to stay for dinner,
you're welcome to.
Are you sure?
Yes, please.
Okay.
Thank you.
No trouble at all.
I can only guess what
a difficult time
this must be for you.
How long have you been
living abroad?
It's... it's a bit of a blur.
I moved over to England
as a child,
went to boarding school
and then,
yeah, sort of stayed on.
So abroad is more home to me
now than home,
if you know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.
And you've been working
on a novel?
Yes. Yep.
My second stab.
My first attempt was horrendous,
so...
uh, yeah, I mean, a total,
I mean, a real mess.
But luckily for me,
no one read it.
So...
Anyway, the reason I'm back here
in the States is, was...
Other than seeing my sister,
is because an agent
took a liking to a couple
of the chapters of the...
you know, the thing
I'm working on now, and...
I'm going to go meet him.
Great.
Yeah.
I was four pages
into my masterpiece
when I went and got that
real estate license, so...
Four pages is better than
nothing, you know, so.
Everyone has to start
somewhere.
What about you, Lucy?
Any idea what you want
to do or be, or?
Yeah well, I have a lot
of thoughts.
Nothing concrete though.
That's okay.
I get that.
She's still so young, so...
Um, coffee anyone?
- That's a good idea.
- Mmmhmm.
I'd love one.
Great.
Thank you.
You're a lucky man.
Family's all there is,
and you have a great one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm sure they can drive you
up the wall sometimes,
but take it from someone
who knows a wonderful thing
when he sees it.
Goodnight.
Bye.
Hello, Vanessa?
Hi Philip.
Sorry if I'm interrupting.
Could you possibly swing by
and see me
for a few minutes
this afternoon?
Okay sure.
I've got a few errands to run.
Would 3:00 work?
Mm-hmm, perfect.
Okay.
See you then.
Okay, bye.
Uncle Phil!
Hey Lilly.
So great to see you.
What are you doing home?
Week before midterms.
Figured I'd come home
to raid their fridge
and get all my washing done.
Oh, yeah, that's why
I'm here too.
So what parent are you after,
Mom or Dad?
Dad.
Hey, um, they told me
about Lucy.
Oh.
I'm really, really sorry.
Can you please tell her
she can always call me?
She's like my little sister.
That's very nice.
So Dad is in his office.
Okay.
See you soon.
Listen Al, it's a first
edition 'Catcher in the Rye'.
I've already got two offers.
I told you, look,
anything above 40,
you're in with a shot.
No, I'll let you know.
Okay, good.
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.
Sorry to barge in.
No, not at all.
What do you need?
I've got a favour to ask.
Okay.
I'm looking for a novel
called "Shadowcast."
It's three years old.
Couldn't find any copies
online myself.
Author's name?
Uh, James Flagg,
with two g.
GG.
Okay, here it is.
Historical fiction,
privately published
with a super small printing
in the UK.
Shouldn't be a problem to find.
When do you need it?
As soon as you can get it?
A week, two at the most.
Okay.
How are you?
Really good.
Really well.
No, things are good.
Coke head.
She's such a druggie.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.
It's okay.
I, I saw you from the pier.
My family docks
their boat there.
- You mind if I...
- No.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Are you in a hurry?
'K.
Come with me.
And two coffees for you.
Thank you very much.
It's good.
What?
What is it?
It's nothing.
I, I was just surprised
to see you walking home
from school today.
Why would that be surprising?
I like walking.
On your own, I mean.
I mean, I was surprised seeing
you walk home alone.
I just assumed a girl
like you would...
have lots of friends.
I guess.
But you don't, do you?
Why is that?
Today was my first day
at that place.
Oh.
I got thrown out of boarding
school last week.
Really?
Why?
What... what did you do?
I did a line of coke
in the science lab.
Wow.
Yeah, that'll do it.
Nice.
Well I hope that blow
was worth it.
Whatever.
Whatever.
"Daphne Flagg's blood
is on this man's hands.
"His self-serving meddling
in his patient's lives
"through his experimental
methods has led to her death.
"And if you don't take action
against him at once
"without delay, you too will
have blood on your hands."
Have you ever received
a complaint
or letter like this
about me before?
No, of course not.
Okay, then why would you
dignify it?
I'm not dignifying it, Philip.
But I can't ignore it, either.
Oh.
I have an obligation as the head
of the department,
and as your friend I have to be
very careful about what I say
and don't say.
Okay.
Let's work through
this methodically, okay?
Did you attempt to use
your sessions with her
to sort out
your own issues?
That's ridiculous.
I referenced my own experiences
to help her process
some of her loss.
How so?
That was the only way I could
get her to trust me.
Early on there was some
predictable suggestive
language and affect.
How did you respond?
I didn't, I ignored it.
Was there any indication
of suicidality more recently?
No.
I don't know.
Did you abruptly and cruelly
create the despair
that led to her suicide?
What do you think?
Doesn't matter what I think.
Are you kidding me?
Give me a break.
What?
Nothing, I was just thinking
what if...
Yeah?
I was just wondering,
what if we were friends?
Um...
No secrets, no hiding.
Friends.
Good first day?
Mm-hmm.
And you?
How was your day?
Good.
You know, the usual.
Hey Philip, we're waiting
for you.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
James, you know,
from last night.
He came by an open house
this morning.
I think he's going to list
his sister's house with us.
Really?
What, is something wrong
with that?
I mean, this is my job.
This is what I do
every single day.
Clients come from everywhere,
Philip.
Yes, I know.
It's not like there's anything
inappropriate about that.
I get it. I understand.
I understand that.
Do you?
Because you seem a little
uncomfortable.
Oh, well then...
I'll just have
to get over it.
Yeah.
Hello?
So I guess what I'm saying is,
the top side of the price range
that I had mentioned seems to
be only going higher and higher.
That's good though, right?
That's...
Yes. It's a very good thing.
I appreciate all you've done,
and I apologize
if I haven't shown as much
gratitude as I should.
Please James, you're still
in the midst of going through
a very difficult process
right now.
I'm sure no one knows that
more than you.
I don't...
Yeah, I haven't talked about it
with anyone for a long time.
You don't have to now.
Please know that's not
what I was...
My husband and I have
a very different way
of dealing with things.
We don't talk about it.
Can you tell me
another one?
Yes, absolutely.
What's a flower's favourite
body part?
I have no idea.
The mouth, because
it has two lips.
You're funny.
You'll have to tell that one
to your dad.
We weren't even in a rush.
You have a good sense
of humour.
Thanks.
I get it from you.
That's right you do.
We were on our
to hockey practise.
I was driving.
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah.
Down Windsor Road.
My baby.
Sometimes we need to do things
that scare us,
in order for us to grow.
Yeah.
Those are new skates too, so...
I've gotta keep going.
That's the spirit, kid.
It's all right.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Hello?
Mrs. Ledyard,
this is Philip.
How are you?
Fine.
It's 20 past 3:00 and I'm
wondering where Freddie is.
Freddie is not coming,
Dr. Clark.
Okay, is everything
all right?
No, it's not.
I'm finding a new therapist
for my son.
May I ask why?
You know why, please
don't call me again.
Hello?
Hi.
I won't be long.
Hang on.
Hey.
Where you going?
Oh, I'm going to the library.
It's a study group
for history class.
Okay.
How are you going
to get there
and then how are you going
to get back?
Um, this senior named Eva?
She's really smart.
She's just got into Yale.
Bye.
No, woah.
Hang on.
Why are you looking at me
that way?
How do you think
I'm looking at you?
Like you don't trust me
or something.
I'm your Dad.
It's my responsibility
to make sure that you're
with a safe driver.
Okay, fine. Fine.
Why don't you come out
and meet her then?
Come out and embarrass me in
front of a car full of people.
What do I care?
Hey.
What are we doing?
Just trust me.
Okay, okay.
Come on, you had to feel it
the night you came over.
What?
The tension.
It's like my family's signature.
Tension's our middle name.
Why though, why, why
is there tension there?
No hiding, right?
Right.
I had a half-brother.
He died in a car crash
three years ago.
My dad and my stepmother,
they loved being with each
other and now it's...
Now, let me guess.
Now they both pulled away,
each into a private corner.
Their separate world.
No place for you,
am I right?
Especially your dad,
at a time when you had never
needed him more.
So a girl who never caused
a bit of trouble
suddenly began to find
it everywhere.
Drops old friends,
ditches school,
probably even tries
a bit of shoplifting.
Yeah?
Who told you that?
You did.
It's written all over you.
Hello?
Hi Philip, uh, listen.
I... I received a new letter.
Jesus Christ.
Whoever it is,
they are threatening
to go to the State Board.
What the hell is going
on here?
I had three no shows today.
No calls, nothing.
That doesn't happen in a month,
let alone an afternoon.
Is there a fight you're having
with someone?
Some professional jealousy?
A student, someone
with a grudge?
Philip?
You still there?
Yeah no, I can't think
of anybody.
It's put me and the department
in a very difficult position,
Philip.
I don't know how much longer
I can contain this.
I understand.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Ok.
James.
Grace.
This is a surprise.
Sorry, I was just driving past.
I saw your sign.
So, Daphne's house,
I need to find an agent.
I can help you with that.
Let me write down
my number.
And anything you need,
house or otherwise.
How much longer you going
to live like this, Grace?
How much longer you going
to live like this, Grace?
Hey.
Lucy's back.
Good.
I was starting to get worried.
How are you doing?
It's been a while since you
asked me a question like that.
Well I'm asking,
how are you doing?
I'm good.
Work? Work's all right?
How's James? Any offers
on the house yet?
What is it with you?
What do you mean?
What is it with you
and that man?
He came around once
and I made the huge mistake
of mentioning that to you,
and now that's all you fucking
want to talk about.
Not so.
And no, I haven't
seen him again.
Hello?
James?
Yeah, yeah,
come in.
Hi Doc.
Just sorting through so.
You okay?
Listen, I'd like you to find
a new real estate agent.
Uh...
Why?
Well, Daphne was my patient
and there need to be boundaries.
It gets too complicated.
I just thought because Grace
was in the business, um, I...
James.
I'm asking you to find
a new realtor.
I don't think I'm going
to be selling now, anyway.
Not yet.
I've been meaning to call Grace,
um...
All right.
Well then, there's no issue.
Okay.
Um, listen.
Whilst you're here,
could I ask you for a favour?
What?
Could you give me a hand
with the couch?
I'm sorry, I've,
I've got to go.
It's a bit awkward
to carry on my own.
I just want to...
it would be a big help.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Okay, I'll walk it round
one second.
Just put it down there.
Do you know what, actually?
Can I try at the back
of the rug?
Thank you.
Uh, listen. I just
have to say...
The deepest hurt
I've ever felt.
That was something Daphne
used to say.
The deepest hurt
I've ever felt
was when I tried to do good
and was shamed for it.
I'm not your enemy,
Doctor Clark.
I never said you were.
You didn't have to.
The brother, then?
He's the only person I can think
of who would want to hurt me.
Because he blames you
for her death.
Yes.
However irrationally,
but when you consider
the history of psychosis
in his family,
is it that hard to believe?
Just why?
Why would he bring up Daphne
to you like this?
The deepest hurt.
It's meaningless.
He said that to your face,
right?
Yes.
If this man is clinically
psychotic,
he wouldn't mess around
with misdirection.
He'd go straight
for the jugular,
hit his target
close to home.
In his kitchen, where he lives
and breathes.
Well, I'm not so sure
that he isn't.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, my stepmom.
How is she?
She's on some weird trip,
and my dad needs to see
a shrink himself.
Trust me, you don't know her.
I mean, you only met her
once, so.
This is very strange behaviour
from her.
Anyway, um...
So where to tonight?
Do you want a beer?
Yeah.
All right. Don't move.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Do you know Vanessa?
James! James!
Come here.
They're friends,
friends of my family.
What?
Friends of my family,
we should leave.
Okay.
Look at him.
He looks so sad.
He doesn't look sad.
It's the weirdest
little bunny.
No, it's not.
It needed saving.
So, you know,
you're welcome.
Thank you, though.
For everything.
All right.
So, um, when you're done
with your sister's house,
then what?
I don't know.
You'll be leaving, right?
Yeah.
Take me with you.
Really?
Yeah.
Honey, about this summer.
If you still want to go
to British Columbia,
that sounds nice.
We could also think about Europe
or South America.
Remember Europe?
Is that how you think
this works?
That after all this time
it's your decision to make?
It's not up to you.
Hey Vanessa, it's me.
I'm going to have to reschedule
our lunch today.
I hope that's okay.
Sorry, bye.
Hello there.
Thank you so much for meeting me
at such late notice...
Okay, so this is it.
And it's got a pool
in the back, so...
Look, I just came to tell you
that what happened
the other day was...
Yeah.
You understand?
Yeah.
I can't.
I am...
I need to go.
Washington Board of Psychiatry.
Hello?
I'd like to make
a formal complaint
against one of
your psychiatrists.
Okay, would you mind
holding please.
Yes, I'll hold.
It's extremely difficult
for all of us within the department,
and you can't tell us who's
making these accusations?
I'm sorry, Doctor Fanning.
But the Board's decision
is unanimous.
I'll speak to Philip
personally.
We're very sorry.
Thank you.
Philip, new semester Monday,
and I know you'd had plans
to resume your class load.
But that's not possible now.
The administration board
wants you to step aside
until this issue with your
patient is fully investigated.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
I've received a summons
from Olympia.
This is threatening
to revoke your license
pending an appearance
before the State Board.
Do you think that James
is behind this?
I don't care.
I don't know,
I don't care.
You need to do something.
Find some proof, Philip.
You have to defend yourself.
Jump in.
Where to?
Fiji?
Rio?
Rome?
Anywhere but here.
You cold?
A little.
A gentleman?
Beer?
Yeah.
Give me one sec.
Lucy?
Lucy!
Shit!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Hey, hey!
Lucy!
Get away from me!
What's gotten into you?
What are you,
spying for them?
You fucking informant?
What are you talking about?
You lied to me!
You're crazy.
No, I'm not crazy!
You told me you didn't know
my stepmother!
I don't know your stepmother!
Then why the fuck
is she calling you?
I'll tell you, alright?
We bumped into each other
in town.
We said hello.
I asked her if she knew a good
appraiser for my sister's house.
All right? She said she did.
She said she'd call me later
with his number.
And I mean, that's exactly
what she did.
That's all she did,
that's it.
Take it.
Listen to the message.
Honestly, if you don't
believe me.
Go on.
Take it.
I said take it.
Go home, pack your bags.
I'll pick you up later.
We're leaving tonight.
Thank you.
I um, I've got something
that I wanted to say to you.
For many years, I very carefully
worked through the stages,
processing...
Evan's death and...
I thought I'd done a pretty
good job of it.
But I hadn't.
What I had done was develop
a coping mechanism.
And...
that was to, um,
to blame you.
For no reason other than,
I think I just wanted
everybody else to be as empty
and broken inside as I was.
You sure didn't deserve it,
because you gave him life,
and you loved him,
and you took care of him.
And he loved you more
than anybody else.
And it certainly
wasn't your fault.
There's nothing I could do
but pray that you forgive me.
Philip
something happened today.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
I have to tell you.
You don't have
to tell me.
No. Listen to me. Philip.
Please.
I don't want you to have
to say it.
It's okay.
It's not your fault.
I put you in that car,
I drove you to his house.
I put you in his arms.
I left you all alone
for all those years,
and it's my responsibility
and it's my fault.
Philip, I'm sorry.
Hi, this is James Flagg.
Please leave a message.
Um, hey James.
Uh, I'm ready when you are.
Uh... Yeah, so just, I'll see
you when you get here.
Hi, this is James Flagg.
Please leave a message.
Hi, this is James Flagg.
Please leave a message.
Hi, this is James Flagg.
Hi, this is James Flagg.
...message.
Hi, this is James Flagg.
...message.
...message.
Hi, this is James Flagg.
...message.
Hi.
Hey.
Want some coffee?
- Thank you.
- Okay.
You know, I call and I call, and
you just don't answer anymore.
Why are you doing this to me?
Shit.
You gotta be kidding me.
Trouble?
Yeah.
I could take a look.
Oh, no it's...
It's okay.
Look, I... I understand if you
want me to keep walking,
it's fine.
Honest.
Have a look.
Okay.
- One sec.
- Sure.
Hi, Triple A?
Yeah. I'm just
on the corner of...
They're saying 45 minutes
to an hour.
Thank you so much.
Can I... can I take you
somewhere in the meantime, or?
- No, I'm...
- No?
I'm good.
Okay.
I was just, uh, hoping to get to
the pharmacy before it closes.
You know, pick up a prescription
for Lucy, but...
Let's... let's go.
I'm just literally parked there.
Oh.
I'll have you there and back
in two seconds.
Your car will be fine.
Um, I don't...
I don't bite.
Uh...
It's up to you.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah?
Just real quick.
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Hold on.
Thank you.
It's okay, honestly.
I'm sorry, it's broken.
Um... Oh.
We're not going very far, so...
Oh, you turn here.
Make a right.
This um, we were supposed
to turn back there.
Do you want me
to answer it?
Hey.
Hey. It's me.
I'm wondering if you wanted
to grab a bite
and see a movie tonight.
Mm-hmm.
Grace, you okay?
Grace?
Hey, where are you?
Oh god.
Grace, where are you?
Stop the car, please.
I said stop the car!
I don't...
Grace?
I said stop the car,
I want to get out!
Grace!
Grace, stay
where you are.
Grace, can you hear me?
Grace!
Grace! Grace!
Say something.
Hey, Doc.
The deepest hurt
you've ever felt.
Windsor Road.
Wakey-wakey, here we are.
Windsor Road.
No!
No!
No! No!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Please, please!
Hey!
What the hell are you doing,
get off!
Get off him!
Hello, Vanessa?
I spoke to Grace.
She told me what happened.
My god, Philip.
I know. It's okay.
It's over with now.
You have to call the police.
There must be witnesses.
Grace's account
of what happened.
I've already called them.
They say that she got
into his car voluntarily.
All they can charge him
with is reckless endangerment.
I don't think they're going
to mount a man hunt for that.
Have you warned Lucy
about him?
We'll talk to her
tomorrow morning.
She's been locked
in her room all day.
Surely the police have grounds
to arrest him,
or at least get a restraining
order.
They can't find him, Vanessa.
They've checked Daphne's house,
he's gone.
He's gone.
Lucy?
You okay?
I'll be fine. Okay.
Look. I need to talk to you
about something.
Do you remember that man that
came to dinner, James Flagg?
He's a very sick
and dangerous man.
So if you see...
Why would I see him,
Grace?
I mean, it's two
different worlds.
I don't know why our paths
would cross.
I don't even know why
you're asking me this.
It's just...
What's going on with you,
Lucy?
Is everything okay with you?
Yeah.
Lucy, you know I'm here
for you.
You can talk to me about
anything, you know that.
I don't want to talk
right now.
Hey.
I, no... Please, just go.
Hey, Lucy?
What the...
What is wrong with you?
Your door is locked.
Yeah?
Well, you're not supposed
to lock your door
if you're not going to answer
me, all right?
I can lock my door.
Well I don't know if you're
okay in there...
I'm okay!
You don't say anything.
I don't know if you're okay.
I am fine.
There's a lot going on. I wanted
to talk to you for a minute.
James Flagg is extremely
dangerous, and...
No, I'm not in the mood
to be analyzed by you!
I'm not a fucking
patient, okay?
Hey, hey, hey! I want to come in
and talk to you.
Well, I don't want
to talk to you!
Well I...
I hear myself talking to her
and I just can't stand the sound
of my own voice.
I just can't help but feel
like I let her down.
She will come back to you.
It's not enough
to love somebody.
You have to let them feel
that you love them.
Hello?
Philip.
It's Michael Toff
over at Heritage Point.
I need to talk to you about uh,
James Flagg?
Okay.
He turned up here
at the hospital.
He's admitted himself?
Last night.
He said voices in his head
had returned,
that he'd done a crazy thing
with his car?
He kept mumbling
about the park in Portland.
Oh, and uh, he's become
very agitated
at the thought that
you won't see him.
Okay.
But here's the deal.
The only person he says
he'll talk to is you.
Oh.
No, no.
No.
He won't authorize
release of his records,
won't let us draw blood, get
any sort of medical profile.
Consider this a
professional appeal
from one clinician
to another.
Jesus Christ.
He wants to talk to me.
This might be a mistake.
This is all on your terms.
The moment you're finished
with him,
the interview's concluded.
Thank you.
Good afternoon,
Doctor Clark.
James, tell me why I'm here.
I need to say I'm sorry.
I need to confess.
I'm not a priest.
Just listen to me.
Okay?
Just... just listen,
that's all you have to do.
Okay.
Did you ever meet him?
The boyfriend.
Daphne and her boyfriend.
I think his name was Eric.
Yeah.
Tell me why I'm here.
I have no novel I'm writing.
Not now.
Um...
The secrets that I used,
they were yours.
They were all yours.
Secrets I got from Daphne.
From Daphne.
From the book she was
starting about herself,
and about you.
Everything you ever
told her,
every little thing
about your life.
She wrote it all down.
And I read it.
About your wife.
Your daughter.
Every little thing.
Every intimate detail.
Jesus Christ.
And then I knocked
on your door.
Why did you knock
on my door?
I told you why.
You haven't told me anything.
There's, there's a curse.
There's a curse on us,
all of us.
On Daphne, on my mom,
on my dad.
I don't care.
What do you want from me?
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
You're very sick.
Philip.
I'm so sorry.
This absurd.
We're done.
This is done.
Okay. That's it.
No, no, no, no, there's more.
There's more.
There's no more.
All the patients that stopped
coming, okay?
All the letters I wrote
to your boss,
to the State Board,
please forgive me, please.
Please, I'm not finished.
There's one more thing,
there's one amazing thing.
Get him back
to his room now.
Grace, I still smell her.
Grace.
I still smell her.
Hello?
I think I'm feeling better.
Except for all these sounds
I keep hearing.
Listen to me.
Listen, you son of a bitch.
Don't you call here again.
This is over.
Click, click, click, click.
Jesus Christ.
Just tell me what the click,
click, click, click is.
Please.
I just wanted to share
some information with you
that was relayed to me
by Doctor Toth.
All right.
Since James threatened you
last night,
they have confiscated
his phone and isolated him.
But he continues
to bring up Portland,
some vision in his head
of the city at dawn.
He said you'd understand.
I told you that means
absolutely nothing to me.
And Vanessa, please tell Doctor
Toth that our family's been
through a lot and we'd like
our privacy now.
I understand.
I'm so sorry, Philip.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You've been wonderful,
thank you.
So the food is in the oven.
All you have to do
is heat it up, okay?
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us?
I'll be fine, Grace.
Cell is clean, open up,
please.
It's a beautiful place
with a view of the ocean.
Oh, it sounds lovely.
In Deep Cove.
I can smell your...
your famous soda.
Hence the mint.
Do you mind?
Of course not.
So I've spoken to the Board.
Yes.
We can put this
behind us now.
You deserve to have
your life back, Philip.
Before I forget...
Thank you so much.
As promised.
That's the right one, eh?
Yeah.
There it is.
What is it?
The book.
'Shadow Cast'.
That red wine, mmm.
Honestly.
Please control yourself.
Do you know what Stuart went
through to get a hold of this?
Mmmhmm.
It's amazing you found it.
Oh, no.
This isn't, uh...
Philip?
What is it?
Oh, come on, answer
for Christ's sake.
Toth, listen.
It's Philip Clark.
James Flagg is very dangerous
and you need to lock him down.
When he was saying Portland,
he was taunting us.
I just got a call from London
that they have a James Flagg
who's already
been admitted for...
Toth, listen to me.
He is not her brother.
He is her boyfriend.
His name isn't James Flagg.
He's Eric Dalton.
Do you understand?
It's her boyfriend.
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't...
Listen to me.
He's not British,
he's not a writer.
He's psychotic.
He's her boyfriend.
He's violent and abusive.
And in Portland he may have
killed my patient's friend.
She's dead. Joan.
He did it to make her
so distraught
that she would take him back.
But she didn't take him back.
He made it look like a suicide,
but it wasn't a suicide.
Why would he do something
like...
Because he's clinically insane.
It wasn't a suicide.
He killed her.
Toth, listen to me!
Lock him down!
God.
Lock him down!
Oh, Jesus.
What?
He's... he's gone.
What do you mean,
he's gone?
He thinks that I made
Daphne leave him,
and he wants
to punish me.
So he came after you.
I walked away from him, Philip.
I left him.
He had me in his grasp.
If he wanted to kill me,
he could have.
- Lucy.
- Lucy.
Come on, Lucy.
Straight to voicemail.
Lucy, listen to me.
Do not go outside.
Stay in the house.
Lock every single door.
We are on our way home.
911, what's
your emergency?
My daughter is in danger.
- Hello?
- Ma'am, can you hear me?
Shit.
Call them back.
I am.
James.
She's not picking up.
Philip!
Ugh, fuck.
Lucy, listen to me,
call me as soon as you get this!
Do not go outside.
Lock every single door, Lucy.
- James.
- Hey.
I knew you'd come.
Better late than never.
I need you to go get
your stuff, okay?
We're going.
- I'll be two seconds, I swear.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
Come on, we gotta go.
Woah.
We will.
What?
I have something I want
to show you.
What?
You heard me.
James, why are you talking
like that?
There's no hiding, right?
- James, James.
- Shhhh, shhhh.
I don't want to go now.
I'm...
All right.
Just come with me.
No, no...
Just come with me.
Please stop.
Stop fighting, Lucy.
Stop, stop!
Lucy... PLAY NICE!
Fuck!
Go!
Oh my god,
that's his car!
Lucy!
All you had to do was listen!
Lucy!
Dad!!!
Fuck!
Bitch!
Here he is!
Here he is!
Come on, Doc!
Come on!
Fight back, man!
Hey, Grace.
Come on, Doc!
You can know
how it feels, Doc!
You're going to know the pain!
You're going to know the pain!!
Dad!
Look what you made me do, Doc.
Look what you made me do.
This is for Daphne.
