Take my advice Dilli, never
allow women to come near you.
What?
How could you live with
a woman for so many years?
He's going with a girl.
What happened this morning?
I heard lot of noise from your house.
Uncle and I had an argument.
About what?
About my marriage.
Meera... please...
I...
Hey...
Meera, I love you.
What?
What's my number?
42... and a half?
Pack your baggage
and come to my house.
Which room? Your sister's
or your mother's room?
My room!
Without marriage?
It's a sin.
Inba, bike is pulling over.
Go to Taramani.
Sir... please give me a
lift till that corner.
Yeah!
That auto... thanks.
Never entertain women.
If you feel like having one,
go, enjoy and then forget.
Never buy a wine shop
for a bottle of wine.
What do you say?
Love story?
Yes.
Go little faster or else it'll
be the end of my love story.
Relax... we can catch her.
Auto... auto...
Hey, stop... stop please.
Thanks boss.
Meera... please...
What am I to do with this devil?
I can neither live with
her nor without her.
Isn't your pulse racing?
Aren't you getting tensed?
I want to see Niagara
Falls holding your hands.
I want to have two girl
babies just like you.
And get my head tonsured at
Pittsburg Venkateshwara temple.
Shall I overtake him?
You're an experienced man.
I'll follow your advice to the letter.
How long do you know me?
One week? Eight weeks?
You want to make me a mother
of two children so soon.
He's speeding up.
You haven't replied me yet.
Shall I keep her or not?
Look near you.
Think and tell me.
Meera, I love you.
Hello, brother...
I love...
Stop... stop... stop I say.
Hit the bull's eye!
Inba - few months earlier...
Central Jail - Chennai
Leave me.
Catch him... don't leave him.
Inba, your bail order has come,
sir is calling you.
Greetings sir.
All your belongings are in this.
Rs.40 and 70 paise.
Check yourself.
10 paise is short.
I've lost sense of humour
living with criminals in jail.
This is the wage you
earned doing wood work.
Keep it yourself.
Buy a good bucket for B-Ward.
Bloody hell, it dries off
before you get a bucket of water.
Sign this.
Autograph?
Bye sir.
Take a bail order on
Friday, we can wind it up.
Saturday and Sunday are
holidays. Monday too.
Come Inba.
Come, take a good breath
of free outside air.
It's the same air inside too.
But with the farts of 150
prisoners mixed into it.
Come on move.
Do you know your brother
Guna has bailed you out?
I was sad missing this chaos.
He told me to bring
you to him immediately.
I've a more important work
before that, Swaminathan.
I don't know all that. Guna
wants to meet you immediately...
He told me bring you...
Got scared? - No.
You can rule only with fear.
Remember it.
Hey, stop.
Get down.
Go... bye... bye.
Take this and leave.
What should I tell Guna?
Hey, come.
Come let's go.
Don't go.
Don't commit the same
mistake again and again.
Enough of getting beaten up by him.
She'll not come.
If you create trouble here,
I may have to call the police.
Can't you understand Tamil?
Leave at once please.
Hey, Thick set glasses!
This is my family problem,
You'll come here to read
the weekly magazine free.
Has any one asked you to
mediate between us?
Don't I understand Tamil?
My hand is paining... my hand...
If you walk out now, father
will never see your face again.
Don't curse me mother.
Hand is paining... hand...
- Leave him, Sasi will not come with you.
She has nothing do with you.
My hand is paining...
- Sasi, go inside.
Listen to me.
God's procession is going outside.
God knows everything.
You don't know anything.
I'll not remove this.
What's this? You've
forgotten everything.
What's this? - Get lost man!
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
I'm listening... go ahead.
Will you take up the job I find for you?
I'll go if you find it.
Definitely.
Promise me.
How can I? Leave my hand.
Your shift starts at 9
in the morning.
You've to punch the card.
Printing rolls come from depot
and harbour, you've to check
You mustn't send anything
out without a gate pass,
not even a pin also.
That's your work.
30 minutes lunch break.
Rs. 10 extra for each
hour you work overtime.
What's the salary?
You'll start at Rs.2000 after cuts.
Six months probation and
Rs.500 increment after that.
What will be the value
of equipment here?
Why?
Just for information, It's security
is going to be my responsibility.
You just be careful, Head clerk
will look after other things.
Just tell me the approximate value.
Please tell me sir.
The machine you see here
costs Rs. 2.5 crores.
Evaluate other equipment yourself.
Sir... sir... what if it
catches fire suddenly?
What are you saying?
What if it gets stolen at
night when I'm not in duty?
What are you blabbering?
Suppose if any one
burns this place down.
Who do you think will do it?
Any one may do it.
Fire god himself may do it.
Or else I myself may do it.
Anything may happen.
Sir, man sent by Meenakshisundaram
is saying absurd things,
I think he's here to create trouble.
Sir? One minute sir.
Greetings sir.
Is it justice to take care Rs.2.5
crores worth machinery paying Rs.2000?
Then okay, I'm not
responsible for any damages.
Okay?
I'm not threatening you sir.
I'm giving you free advice.
If you look after me well,
I'll take good care of your press.
If you don't want me I'll
say good bye now and leave.
God will punish the man
eyeing your business, okay?
Your boss is calling
us inside, come with me.
Dear...
Sir... Meenakshisundaram... greetings.
Inba, tell me if what you've
done is justified?
Why did you do like that?
He offered that job for my sake.
How could you threaten
and take money from him?
They have left Rs. 2 crores
worth machinery without security.
Rs. 2000 salary a month to protect it!
Is it justified?
Sir, you've considered
Inba very cheap.
Who is next?
Inba, your brother is waiting
for you in car outside.
If you go out now...
My wife says not to go out.
No Inba, your brother
is waiting for you.
He's angry with you.
Look, I'm shivering here.
Inba will not come.
He'll not take to
his brother's way.
Go and tell him.
What's the matter?
He didn't say it clearly but
said, "An important job."
No Inba. - What will
be the spoils? - Plenty!
Inba, I'm telling you, am I not?
Why don't you shut
your mouth for sometime?
Tell him that Inba will not come.
Inba will not come...
He'll not come with you.
Get up man.
Do you know how many difficulties
I had to face to get you out?
Was it for the love for me?
I'll take leave.
He's up against the wall some where.
He needs men to fight
for him. Am I right?
Sir, is this the way to
speak to a brother?
Brother!?
I was 8 years old... Vellore bus stand...
Giving me a bun and asking
me to stay put there.
He wiped off the dust from
under him and vanished.
I searched and found
him after 10 years.
Don't ruin your life
gambling with friends.
If you want to come good
in life join with me.
We were playing rummy.
Get up man!
Elections are nearing
in Neikaranpatti.
Students are swarming there
like locusts from no where.
They're influencing the minds of
the villagers with their ideas.
A public meeting is scheduled,
we need crowds for it.
You're to bring men in 10 lorries
giving them Rs 50 and a biriyani packet.
Ensure students don't create trouble.
What was his name?
Another one... the troublesome guy?
Beat them?
Kill them?
Inba will not do.
Inba, tell him to leave.
Sasi, keep quiet.
I will not.
Here man and woman have
changed their status.
I'll not allow my husband
to come with you.
Keep quiet
Wear a sari Inba,
I'll buy you an inner skirt.
I'll will not allow Inba 
to become a devil like you.
If you go with him... - Shut up!
Threatening me?
No, I'm pleading.
Can't you see it?
I don't want to mediate in
a fight between two women.
If you change your mind and when
your moustache sprout, come to me.
She was advising for your good... - Father!
No Inba... No... leave her... leave...
I shouldn't have come
here leaving my home.
Go away... go.
Nobody is stopping you here.
I don't need you.
What?
This world never gave
anything to people like us.
Whatever I've is forcibly
taken by me.
Hey, go away.
No one is important to me,
including you.
If you come back I'll kill you.
Educated lot have come
to reform the society.
He has beaten her like a street
dog. Will he ever come good in life?
Are you ok?
You come with me. You
come with me... come.
I'll go now and meet you later. Go...
What?
Where's Sasi? - Why?
Where's Sasi?
Beating a pregnant woman like
a dog and leaving her on street,
how dare you call her now?
Sasi will not come.
It's common between wife and husband.
You stay out.
You shut up, he's a cruel man
and you're supporting him.
He beat her earlier, are you
planning to beat me later?
Will I ever beat you?
She's inside.
I was telling and you told him... - Let him...
Why didn't you tell me?
Which month is running? - Third month.
Who is the father?
Just for fun.
Won't you laugh?
Won't you show your teeth?
I want a baby girl,
just like you.
She must have dimples when she smiles.
I'm a fighter cock and a little
caressing will make me all yours.
I'm a fighter cock and a little
caressing will make me all yours.
It's trouble when you place
your hand on my heart
You spread a single mat for two of us,
if we've a fight sleep away from me.
You spread a single mat
for two of us,
if we've a fight sleep away from me.
Kill me with your passion for sometime.
Kill me with your passion for sometime.
Kill me with your passion for sometime.
Even betel leaves failed
turn my mouth red.
Your lip-to-lip kiss did the trick.
I want to go to heaven,
show me a good way.
Let our relationship continue
on the country bed.
Let my stomach grow big
like the interest on a loan.
Kill me with your passion for sometime.
Kill me with your passion for sometime.
I'm a fighter cock and a little
caressing will make me all yours.
I'm a fighter cock and a little
caressing will make me all yours.
It's trouble when you place
your hand on my heart.
I don't want any roofed home,
just a hut will do.
No need of any bed
just a mat will do.
Glow from my nose pin is
enough for our nights.
I'll not get satisfied with
just a vegetarian kiss.
Take liberty with me,
I'll not die.
Kill me with your passion for sometime.
Kill me with your passion for sometime.
Velan, is everything ready?
Quick... quick.
Write in credit account.
Velan has stopped giving on credit.
You don't say, let him say.
I'm saying am I not?
Talking like a big mouth.
Beat him.
Inspector Chinnappa?
You can come now.
Yes sir... to University canteen.
Why do you enter politics
leaving your studies?
Which hand do you use to write?
This one, isn't it?
Come... Inba is calling you.
Go... go... go...
Hello mic testing.
I,2,3,4,5...
5,4,3,2,1...
Can you hear me Dilli?
Tell them to raise volume.
Inbasekar testing...
Vote for Inbasekar.
Mic... mic...
Where are we standing now?
What's our position? Think over it.
Have you seen map of India?
You find North swollen and South
shrunk, do you know the reason?
Is it a geographical defect?
Or is it earth's defect?
No, this is economic defect.
How is my arrangement?
Dorai, how is it?
This situation must change.
What should we do to
change this situation?
We must get united.
We must be firm.
We must be united & firm
and hoist our flag in Delhi.
We are going to rule in Delhi.
Today we are passing a resolution.
What is it?
Let it be anything, a flight
or a train or a bus,
not only that let it be a flying bird,
let it be an ant moving on earth,
let's pass a resolution that it must enter
Tamil Nadu before going anywhere else.
My dear and loving brother who is
contesting in the council election,
I humbly request you vote for Ponmozhi
and ensure a massive victory for him.
Thanks to all of you.
Move... move...
Dilli, take him safely to his car.
Long live Minister!
Long live Minister Selvanayagaml
Who is this Inba? - My brother.
He arranged all this
crowd for this meeting.
Ask him to come with us in the car.
- Long live Leader!
Don't you like me or my party, Inba?
What happened sir?
Anything wrong?
Inba, what did you do?
- Wait! I'll tell you.
You went to that college...
what was that college's name?
Madras University.
- Yes, Madras University!
Went there, stage managed
trouble with the students,
teased girl students there,
broke their limbs and bruised
them in sensitive places.
Ask him whether he did or not?
Are you mad or what?
It was my mistake.
I shouldn't have bailed out this beast.
Are you finished?
Can I speak now?
Shut up.
Meeting went off peacefully, isn't it?
Shut up!
Did the meeting go
off well or not sir?
Weren't the students
quite in the meeting?
Who are you talking to?
I can't talk to different
people differently.
Shut up! What did I tell you?
- Tell me.
I told you to nip
any trouble in the bud.
Did any trouble break out there?
Did any one create trouble?
Why did you beat them then?
What else could I've done?
What's the use in beating them
after they create trouble?
We must hit them before
they create trouble.
Will you beat them?
You'll beat them.
If someone questions me in
the Legislative Assembly,
who will answer him? Will you?
I will. - Will you?
I'll answer if I become
like you in future.
Your brother is a terrific!
He will come up in life.
Has your brother done
anything for you?
Forget it.
I told you about some agency
few days back... - LPG... gas agency!
I'm uncomfortable with English.
Make him 50% partner
in that agency.
What? - Okay brother.
You don't worry, I'll take care.
I'm quitting this violent
life from today. - Giving up!
From now on Inba is a businessman.
- What?
A businessman wearing suit and boot.
- Mafia Don?
Why are you laughing Dilli?
Wait a minute.
Businessman? He'll come in one minute.
- Keep quiet.
Hey, wait man!
I'll return it.
Wait!
How nastily they have beaten you!
Why didn't you escape on
seeing such large student group?
Go and wash your face... go.
Did they beat you?
No?
What?
There...
Hello... I'm Inba...
Yes...
No... he's not hurt...
I doubt if he can.
I'll come sir... I'm on my way sir...
I can understand... Yes... what else?
Party work is more
important to us, isn't it?
Oh! Ministership may
come and go anytime.
Okay sir... if you say
so... Right... okay...
Coffee... - Get lost! Okay give...
Did they change your portfolio?
Not changed, they have taken it away!
Who is that guy? With all of you around...
Have you thought about
any name for our child?
Good time to ask.
Any name you suggest
is okay to me.
Coward... how about dumbhead?
I'll break your teeth.
Which Ischool (school) will you put him in?
It is not Ischool but School.
Don't be a show off.
My son mustn't become like me.
You asked for a female baby.
Whether it's female or male,
you must bring it up in a royal way.
You must not beat or scold the child.
No? It'll cry and pass
urine & motion on you.
Shit!
Hey, where're you going?
To meet Prime Minister at Delhi.
Are you coming?
Coward... Dumbhead
Hey its good,
Inba's son Dumbhead
What's this?
Where did you get this?
Give it to me.
In inner skirt, big eyes...
with a gun in your hand,
you look like Goddess Kali.
What is this for?
Give it to me. Don't play with it.
It might blow off.
Is this what you meant by
Gas Agency business?
You won't understand.
Give it to me.
What is this for?
I must know.
I won't tell you.
Give it to me.
Are you going to become
like your brother?
This was one thing left
untouched by you.
Give it to me.
I won't.
Give it to me.
- I won't.
If you dare to poke your nose
in my affairs, I'll kill you.
I'll do what I wish to. Got it?
Get lost.
Take my advice Dilli, never
allow women to come near you.
How did you live with a woman
for so many years?
He's going with a girl.
They snatch away everything
from our life.
The bike is about to stop.
Slow down.
The bike is moving.
Go...
Someone has got on to his bike.
Idiot!
What should I do now?
Follow him.
Never allow women to
come near you.
If you feel like having one,
go, enjoy and then forget.
Never buy a wine shop
for a bottle of wine.
What do you say?
He has stopped in the
middle of the road.
Slowly...
Let them go.
Go...
He's taking a turn.
He's going back
on the same route.
Shall I live with her
or divorce her?
I don't understand
anything you are saying.
What am I to do with this devil?
Neither I could live up
to her expectations...
Isn't your pulse racing?
Aren't you feeling tense?
I'll be, only when I think about it.
He's going fast.
You haven't answered my question.
Shall I live with her
or divorce her?
Shall I overtake him?
You've lot more experience.
I'll follow any advice you give.
Look beside you.
Think about it & tell me.
Look...
Hello... Brother...
MICHAEL- FEW MONTHS EARLIER
Here?
The one who is smoking... It's him.
Vishwa, bring all the students
of Physics & Economics dept.
Be careful.
Michael, they are so many.
I'm scared.
It's enough you cover my back.
I could have gone
instead of Vishwa.
Rathnavel...
Did you beat the students
in the hostel?
Yes.
Is it because your uncle
is a minister?
Yes.
Why do you bring politics
into college elections?
Isn't he asking? Tell him.
I asked you.
Are you happy now?
We shouldn't look at the mirror
at night.
An ATS & a penicillin shot
will take care of it.
Mom, allow him to eat.
He hasn't eaten properly
for the last 2 days.
Joe, put some more meat.
It's nice.
Did you prepare it, Tara?
For 20 years, I used to wait anxiously for
your father every night,
whether he'll come without injuries,
or with injuries,
whether he'll come alive,
or in a coffin.
I was happy that
everything was over.
Don't blame our father.
Don't criticize him. He took up cases
for public cause.
But did nothing for
his family.
There is some magic
in your cooking,
which makes me fight
against injustice.
For a change,
can't you be serious?
I'm serious.
It is said that
everything comes through genes.
Tara being a left hander,
you, worrying about me.
Everything is in the DNA sequence.
Now, DNA is the other name of FATE.
For how long should we be waiting
whether to find you in the hospital
or in a police station.
For how long will you keep
asking the same question?
You haven't reformed from
your childhood.
Is this fair on your part?
Instead of making your mother
live in peace...
Sit down.
You're alright.
If you take insulin regularly,
& reduce sugar,
Doctor said you'll live
up to 90 yrs.
Don't black mail me.
Mom, be proud of your son.
A few such Michael's can
reform the country.
I want my son to be an ordinary man
& not a reformist.
Why can't you be like others?
I was happy that everything
was over with your father.
Our father is not dead.
He lives inside us.
Hi Doctor, how are you?
Fine. What brought you here?
My Physics professor is coming
by this train.
I've come to receive him.
Do you give insulin to your mom
regularly?
Yes, I'm giving.
She's not eating cakes & chocolates,
is she? - No.
He advices everyone
but eats sweets everyday.
Takes whisky giving lame excuses.
Cigarettes under the pillow.
Are these things necessary now?
Excuse me.
- Okay.
Hey GeeGee...
- Aunty...
Uncle...
She has completed Economics
in Delhi School of Economics.
Hi! - Hi!
Our neighbour, Leela aunty's son.
Last time when I saw,
she was only this much,
with braces on her teeth.
I don't have them now.
- I can see that.
Do you still put stitches
for that Einstein?
Twice in a month.
- Brilliant boy.
Keep quiet. You don't know
how much Leela's suffering?
Look, it's your aunty's rule
in our family.
First, it's you.
Second, T.V.
Third, the puppy.
Fourth, myself.
My life runs in this order.
Uncle, I left my watch in the train.
I'll come back.
Your peppermint smell
has not gone yet.
Your Delhi school of Economics
has had no effect on it.
Why didn't you reply
to my letters?
I don't write letters, I'm a man of action.
People say that.
I missed you very much.
But I must go now.
Tomorrow at 4 O'clock.
- Okay.
Okay go.
I didn't understand that
from the beginning.
Why should we spell vous as vu?
Shankar lyer, cut means cut
& put means put to you in English.
But you never raised any questions.
Good evening madam.
Excuse me.
I'm borrowing your
French professor.
Matter is important.
See you later.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me to?
Neikaranpatti.
What?
- Neikaranpatti.
A village.
Living in Delhi, studying Politics
& Economics is not enough.
Shouldn't you know
about the practical difficulties?
You entered the French class,
kidnapped me,
rather than taking me to Pondichery
or to a movie with less crowd,
what "patti" are you taking me to?
I like this trait in you very much.
Give me your hand.
You know French, can't you
teach me a French Kiss? - Get lost.
Get lost.
Go back.
Hereafter don't take water from
this area. Go back.
Go back.
Take your lorries back.
Go back.
For how long will you guard your
water & sand without sleeping?
May be a week...?
10 days...?
Old man, are you going to be like this?
They are minting money
by selling your ground water.
What are you going to do?
Why should we worry
when you people are there?
No one knows where
we will be tomorrow.
After our exams, each one of us will
be heading in different directions.
America, Dubai, London
& so on.
What are you going to do?
What do you want us to do?
You tell me.
He wants us to take
the responsibilities.
But how?
We will do it some how.
You go to your city.
Tell me how?
We have to contest
Councilor elections.
Then, contest.
You want us to
get into politics?
Ask him.
This is your village. Your election.
You must contest.
That's not possible.
Tell us something which
can be done.
They won't allow us to contest.
Don't simply talk.
- Why?
You need money, man power,
influence.
Where will we get them?
- Who said so?
We made his brother to contest.
But he's missing.
Make another man to contest.
If he gets lost,
then another one.
Everyone of you contest.
How many people can he stop
from contesting?
Let us see how he'll stop us.
You must contest the
Councilor elections.
After you win,
protect your village.
He is my fiance.
He's very energetic.
But ask him to be careful.
I saw his palm.
His life line is very long.
Goes beyond the palm.
Does anyone of you has the
guts to contest the elections?
Who's going to contest the village
Assembly elections against them?
Sister...
You single handedly worked hard
& educated me.
Take another step forward.
Like you, make these villagers
live independently.
How can I...
Contest, sister.
You can do it.
Sister...
you can do it.
Sister... - Ok.
Michael, my sister will contest.
Angamma, do you know
what you're doing?
Keep quiet.
Do you need all this?
Shut up.
A woman had the courage
to stand up.
Angamma, you contest.
We are with you.
Won't you congratulate her.
We will make her win.
It's from the professor
Mr. Winebergh from Texas.
An invitation to Michael
to do his research in America.
Professor Mr. Winebergh
is the winner of Noble Prize.
It's great that the invitation
is from him.
Principal, what his name?
- Michael Vasanth.
I'm minister Selvanayagam.
I know.
Principal said that you've got the
scholarship which no one can get.
No... no...
Others have also got it.
Look, I'm very much proud of you.
I'm very much proud of you.
Ask me anything you want.
Do you want to meet the Chief Minister?
I'll arrange it.
I'm like your brother.
Then, can I call you brother?
With pleasure.
Brother, I don't need that
American Scholarship.
Why?
Don't you have money?
Don't you have the ticket?
I'm here.
I'm not interested.
I want to stay here in Tamil Nadu.
Stay here and...
You're not going...?
Such opportunities knock
your door very rarely.
You shouldn't lose them.
Leave the politics to us.
We'll take care of it.
Today we'll fight,
tomorrow, we'll embrace one another.
We'll do all non-sense.
Leave it.
You are a priceless gift of Tamil Nadu.
That's why I want to stay here.
Shouldn't be arrogant.
This is not arrogance, it's honesty.
Why do you want to get into politics?
How long will you bear
the burden all alone?
You've taken the country to
greater heights.
Shouldn't we share your burden?
After all, I'm your younger brother.
Very good.
If everyone starts to think,
what about us?
Correct.
Now, politics is not so good.
Good people are hard to find.
I know.
You must be careful.
When you, my brother is with me...
Live long.
Won't you shake hands with me?
Sure.
You are very good.
He's Public Works Minister,
is it the way to speak to him?
He talked to me with
a smile on his face,
he didn't hug and kiss me, that's all.
I'll go sir, I've a class.
Michael, if he gets angry ours
grants will get stalled.
Which is Trilok's room?
Trilok? Room No: 32.
Can you please call him?
Tell him his relatives have come.
Let's rip off his skin!
Go... go... go.
Remove your hand.
They have beaten him...
- Nothing serious.
Nothing much,
I'll be fine soon Mike.
Who?
Gunasekar's men.
Think about welfare of people.
God's mercy...
Hey, who are you?
Hey, who is that?
Who is that?
Wait!
Leave this place immediately.
Swaminathan, what's happening here?
Listen, what has brought you here?
Stop... there...
You know who I am, don't you?
Stop there, let's discuss
and settle things.
You sit down... I'll also sit...
I'm telling you and you are...
There are women in the house,
I've a 4 year old son...
Why so many people have come?
What am I to do now?
What was my crime?
If you dare to beat
any student again,
10,000 people will come
for your neck.
Let's dictate terms to the fate.
O youth!
Let's change the fate of fate.
O youth!
Hey, who is that?
Who is the writer here?
Why so many people?
- Please hold this.
Hello... Mr. J. Kalaivanan.
Hello sir!
You've to file an FIR...
Pen? Give me a pen.
Kasimedu Gunasekaran has been
beaten up in his house.
Do you know who did that?
Yes. - We beat him.
You all?
- Yes, take down our names.
Aren't you taking down?
List will be little longer.
Lock up room appears
to be very small.
No problem, isn't it?
Take weapons and kill arrogance.
Burn down evil with a lighted wisp.
Burn down the darkness of ignorance.
Amazing!
I can't understand that.
Remember how you passed
your science exam in school,
now you're a Commissioner,
yes...
this is wrong...
a doctor shouldn't do it.
Yes, it is blackmail.
Buddy, do it for me.
Those kids are like my own kids.
A small favour.
Please wait...
Commissioner on the line.
They say it as Grand Unified Theory...
GUT...
I'll try to tell in one equation
entire matter on earth.
Come... come out... go out.
What's all this?
Scribbling and dirtying the walls...
That's why we should never allow
educated men into the cell. Go out.
It seems there's some
problem in high density...
I couldn't understand anything.
Do you've a cigarette?
Anyone else?
Okay sir... thank you sir.
Come on boys...
There's only one, can I take it?
Thank you sir.
Why are pushing me into
an embarrassing situation?
Is it a crime to refuse
American Scholarship?
If rowdies or rogues enter
it's no problem,
but if good and brilliant students
like you enter it,
it will become a terrible
example to others.
Do you need this?
Its because of people like you.
When educated persons like you
get a Government job,
you leave the country
into others hands.
All criminals have entered politics.
If you had entered politics,
I would've been with Prof. Weinberg.
People have put their children in
college with great difficulty.
If they study properly and progress,
Nation will progress automatically
Madam, you studied well and
passed your exams, didn't you?
Yes, first class with distinction.
Has our country progressed?
I'll not speak to Madam like that,
Madam has a beautiful daughter.
How is Madhumitha doing madam?
No need of all this non-sense.
You must give in writing that
you'll stop everything.
Otherwise I may have to rusticate
you from the college.
Okay sir.
Is it your decision or
someone else's decision?
I've no choice.
Will it be me alone?
You and anyone else joining you...
I'll go and ask if anyone
is coming with me sir.
Excuse me madam.
This is too harsh sir,
Michael is really a genius.
I know Govindarajan,
what can I do?
We'll have to be little patient,
we'll find a solution.
We've been patient all these years...
from his under graduate days.
There's absolutely
no change, Professor.
Principal sir!
They all are ready to come with me.
YES!
Are you going to rusticate all of us?
Rusticate me also sir,
I'll leave this college.
Rusticate me also!
What have you done?
You look sexy!
Will you keep quiet
if I tear your vest. - No.
Don't do it.
Don't...
Enough!
Aunt, please wait,
nothing has happened
as you're thinking.
How do you know
what I am thinking?
Whatever it is, it didn't happen.
Tell me what am I thinking?
Did your uncle and aunt
bring you up like this?
Why do women always find
fault with other women?
Would you believe me if I say your
beast like son tore my blouse?
First mend your blouse
and leave this place.
Don't ever come here again.
I'll not come even if you invite me.
Do you think I'll come?
Good bye.
I pity your
future daughter-in-law.
Mind your own business. She's bossing
over me in my own house.
Do you know all this?
- No mother.
I asked both the liars.
Come here.
Angamma, you've won as
you had planned.
Hereafter it's good time for us.
Angamma akka has won,
they didn't even poll 200 votes.
You've found a new way
for our liberation.
This election wouldn't have been
conducted fairly without you.
A woman has won for the
first time in our village.
Shake hands please.
Please...
Don't feel shy.
- No please.
You've created a sensation!
Congratulations!
Great Michael!
Now your turn.
Push him down, can't you
hit a target which is so near?
Look!
Brother! Hello...
you are famous.
Everyone here knows Michael.
He's almost a hero in this college.
I'm Inba. - I'm Dilli.
Who sent you?
Are you training them?
If any one comes to threaten,
they shouldn't get scared, should they?
I've come alone and you're
with bottles in the hand.
Will I dare to threaten you?
Are you Guna's man or the leader?
I'm standing on my
own legs brother.
Keys man!
How much you get to threaten a man?
To beat a man or kill a man?
Dilli, he's trying to get
into our business. - Is it?
Inba, if a man threatens you with
a smile with a knife in the pocket?
What will you do?
What's this brother?
Just tell me.
I'll smile and pat his shoulders,
shake hands with him,
and remember his face.
Bye!
You've done it.
Go.
Hello brother, don't rush.
We both are almost same.
Hit!
You're also throwing stones,
breaking soda water bottles,
you picket and play politics.
I too do the same.
I don't wear shirts like you or
speak in English like you.
Great hit!
Let's see.
What am I to reply to them?
Michael is a good man,
he'll not involve in politics,
shall I say like that?
What's this brother, you've suddenly
started beating!?
You're getting angry too much.
Go and tell them I not scared.
Lift me up please.
Are you hurt?
Hey, come...
Wait... wait brother... white flag...
Brother, please listen to me.
Why we are fighting unnecessarily?
It's paining brother.
You want me to tell them that you'll not
accept their diktats, that's all, isn't it?
Okay.
What do you say Dilli?
- Let's tell them.
We'll announce it publicly.
Leave me. We'll tell as you say.
Okay.
What happened this morning?
I heard lot of noise from your house.
Uncle and I had an argument.
About what?
About my marriage.
They are forcing me to marry
a man I don't like.
The man I like is refusing to marry.
What am I to do?
Pack your baggage and
come to my house.
Which room? Your sister's or
your mother's room?
My room!
Without marriage?
It's a sin.
What's sin in it?
Isn't love also a sin then?
Love is divine... pure divine.
There's nothing like a
thing called love.
Love doesn't exist.
Are you retorting?
We were all born for...
We means I, you, that green shirt,
yellow churidhar, that policeman,
why were we born?
For procreation.
Love, tears, song, painting,
all these are to end up on bed.
It's all hormones!
Atrogen(NC), Oestrogen,
Testrosterone, Progestrone,
just Organic chemistry,
X- chromosome, Y-chromosome,
XX, XY, etc.,
That's all!
It's all over!
Got it?
Yes, absolutely not...
Institution of Marriage is
just for the society.
Just for social acceptance.
Anyway we never do
anything for the society.
Why should we then do this?
What do you want me to do then?
I'll say it in simple words. I love you,
let's live together.
Come and stay in my house.
Didn't your foolish brain get this?
I'm asking if you can tolerate me
and want to live with me.
I'll think and tell you.
Bye!
If I tell you a truth,
will you love me?
Heart is full of...
Love...
Body is full of...
Lust...
If I tell you a truth, - Mel
will you love me?
Percentage of love...
little less...
Percentage of lust...
little high...
On the bed...
will you forgive me?
If I tell you a truth,
will you love me?
On the bed...
will you forgive me?
If I tell you a truth,
will you love me?
On the bed...
will you forgive me?
If I tell you a truth,
will you love me?
On the bed...
will you forgive me?
I've lust for women...
but I'm crazy about you only.
When you look at me desirously...
A lightning will strike on
my spine...
You're my rain bearing cloud...
there is a flooding on
the river of my hormones.
No need of hypocracy any more.
Let's live for ourselves.
If I tell you a truth,
will you love me?
On the bed...
will you forgive me?
Hello... brother!
