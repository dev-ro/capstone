Your words and actions aren't right.
It is your good time that
he is not at home.
- If he knows this, he'II kiII you.
- What wiII he do?
You & the viIIagers are scared of him.
How dare you say that!
- I wiII kiII you...
- Go ahead.
Why are you shouting so IoudIy?
She is not heIping me at home.
You don't even question her.
From fetching water to washing cIothes,
I do every thing. She is shouting at me.
Then why are you shouting Iike heII?
Your ego isn't satisfied tiII
you comment on me.
MuthaIagu, come here.
Do you know, your mother
came in the morning?
I know.
What is the probIem at home?
Nothing.
I heard that your mom and
you had an argument.
She came to see you today.
She cares so much about you.
She wouId've come to check whether
I am in schooI or in the forest.
You are a schooI going girI.
He spends most of the time in jaiI.
How couId you faII in Iove with him?
- Aren't you ashamed to faiI 4 years for him?
- Why shouId I?
If you don't Iike me,
I won't come to schooI.
I've studied enough to become his wife.
- Why are you so rude with everyone for him?
- Rude?
I wouId have been dead
when I was 8 years oId.
If he wasn't there to save my Iife.
I must give myseIf to him.
You oId man! Take it.
Staring at a woman's photo!
They are here again.
Prepare 2 cups of tea for us.
Special or ordinary?
- SpeciaI.
- UncIe, how are you?
- TeII me.
- You're very affectionate today.
- Come, Iet's go.
- Why so earIy?
Let's go.
- Let me finish my tea.
- Come I say.
- How was this!
- Great.
Though you both are reIatives,
he is a respectabIe man in this viIIage.
Teasing him in public place.
Atleast respect his age.
Sevvalai, you are with him always.
Can't you advice him?
He never Iistens to me.
I toId him to reform before some dog
starts advising you. But he doesn't care.
Since you have toId me today.
Am I your scapegoat for today?
Drink tea & Ieave the pIace.
- Let your owner say that.
- Who?
DougIas brother.
Douglas...?
I hired him yesterday onIy.
Are you the owner of this shop?
Give him respect.
- He feIt pity & hired you.
- What can he offer me?
Is this what you teII everyone
in the viIIage?
- How was that?
- Great.
You might have said that.
Get out.
- Happy...?
- So, you are not the owner.
Get lost.
He said that to me.
Now I know he had Iied to me.
What do you want me to do?
You boozed Iast evening
and asking me now?
You are coming to
SakthiveI tempIe tomorrow.
I wiII be waiting there.
We wiII offer prayers together.
Why shouId I pray?
I can't teII you aII that.
You are coming.
Okay. I wiII come.
If you faiI to come on my birthday,
I wiII go wiId.
PIease do so.
He is irresponsibIe.
How is your mother?
Does she know that you are coming here?
She doesn't know. But she is fine.
Why don't you come home & see her?
Why shouId I come?
ShouId I come & see her?
- To heII with her.
- Okay. You don't need to come.
Don't Iet him sIeep tiII 10 O'cIock.
- Send him on time.
- Am I singing a IuIIaby?
Get up. She has come for you.
But you are stiII sIeeping.
She has no other job.
She told you to be somewhere.
- Didn't you go?
- l'm going elsewhere because of her.
Don't act.
You fight with everyone in the village.
You beat others if they
say anything wrong.
But she shouts at you so much,
but you never say anything.
- You have a soft corner for her.
- I can't go after her.
It is not good for a guy Iike me.
Are you such a good man?
You kissed her when you
were just 10 years oId
And daringIy accepted it before eIders.
Now acting innocence?
If you Iike her, take her away.
We don't know when we wiII get kiIIed.
How can I desire to Iive with her?
- What wouId happen to our goaI?
- What goaI?
I mean the TV, interview,
Madras jaiI.
Looks Iike you won't take me there.
How couId you go back
on your promise?
She is after you aII the time.
She wiII forget me if I chase
her away a coupIe of times.
Poor girI!
She is tormenting me.
You caII her a poor girI.
Infact I am the poor souI.
EarIier she was very bIack.
But now she has turned bright.
If you have money,
you can make crows aIso fairer.
Don't say things just Iike that.
WiII you become fair if you get money?
Do you know how fair I was as a kid?
The hot sun made me dark.
Dash.
Don't leave him.
Good.
Good.
He is caIIing you.
Why wouId they caII me?
WiII he get his daughter married to me?
Hey you...
They are caIIing me.
What is your probIem?
What do you want?
Drawing out knives wiII not
make you a fighter.
You need to have guts to be
brave not any weapon.
You are right. TeII that to him who
was stabbed on buttocks.
They caIIed me to say this.
May be they are you friends.
They are bIabbering without even drinking.
We didn't get you on the other day.
We wouId have cut your baIIs.
Leave me uncIe, Iet me finish it
once for aII, group is not strength.
They are provoking you wantonIy.
You have been here since morning.
Who are you waiting here for?
I am waiting to your husband.
We had pIanned to go to
watch a fiIm in town.
Now not came?
TeII him to come quickIy.
What? Waiting go to a cinema?
Today's youth are not trustworthy.
You may do it, my man is
aIso not a gentIeman.
What happened to you?
Sitting IoneIy, taIking and
shaking the hands.
Was it Iike that to you?
Nothing, I'm practicing music.
You know?
I don't know? I know onIy my jobs.
How Iong you wiII you be Iike this?
ShouIdn't you become Iike SusheeIa?
Why shouId we try to be Iike her?
How toId this type.
You come, I wiII teach music for you.
I am very tried. I can't Iearn music.
Shut up, I was yearning to Iearn music.
Let's try to Iearn music.
Mother come on, I wiII teach you.
Now aII of you,
You Iisten to me,

Don't make any mistakes.
Why is she scaring us?
We can't sing that. You sing.

- We can't sing.
Sing.
- What is she singing?
- Some shit!
Sing.
- You sing.
- I've work. I am going.
How couId you Ieave us here?
Looks Iike no body is worth to sing.
Watch out now!
l will teach you this song once.
Will you sing properly, old woman?
l will prepare a dish from tamarind,
...prepare coffee from poisonous milk
Drink it. You will feel music
in your tongue.
You don't need musical pipes.

musical notes for free.
A idle girl has many husbands.
Only a marriage can control
your mischief.
ls it rush of young blood?
We have had our share long back.
l've a great knowledge about music.
Do you have the interest to learn?
Careful with your ear rings.
l will teach you this song once.
Will you sing properly, old woman?
l will teach you this song once.
Has this girl gone mad?
Singing songs to all those passing by.
lf you don't come and

UncIe has come fuIIy prepared.
I wonder where he is.
He has opened the bottIe
to Iessen my work.
Very affectionate uncle.
WiII he get intoxicated?
We give this to buIIs.
It is very strong.
I shouId atIeast Ieave this for my uncIe.
Where did he go?
It is very good.
He wiII ask me for his share.
Who kept this here?
Who are they?
Why are they waIking upside down?
Are they coming from circus company?
Don't puII my hand.
Caressing me with fIowers?
Who are you?
What are you doing?
- Shut up.
- Okay.
l will listen to you if you
say anything with love.
''MUTHALAGU''
Make it fast.
I waiting for you but
you never thought about me.
You wiII think about me every moment.
What's the point in thinking about you?
Come face to face,
why are you compromising for a fight?
UncIe, I wiII buy arrack
tomorrow for sure.
Tell them to stay there.
Let's go out first.
Let them live as they wish.
l can't watch all this nasty stuff.
Take your hands off.
It is not nice.
CaII her.
Hey MuthaIagu, come here.
Can't you hear me? Come here.
What?
Where were you tiII now without
going to the schooI?
Didn't I go to schooI?
I went to Angayarkanni's
house after schooI.
Why are you Iying?
Who toId you that I didn't
go to schooI?
Your father.
Why do you ask me when you know it?
You scoundreI!
How dare you speak Iike that?
What's making you to go after him?
I wiII kiII you.
Why are you insuIting us?
You act as if you know nothing.
Why are you beating me?
Have you gone mad?
Are you trying to rebuiId
the oId reIationship?
It is you & your famiIy who do it.
Get your daughter married to someone
or kiII her. I don't care.
Why shouId I suffer
because of you both?
You oId woman! Die.
How many times to teII you
to perform her marriage?
But you never Iisten to me.
You wanted an educated groom.
Now you feeI the heat.
Where are you going? Come here.
What wiII you do?
The same bIood runs in my body too.
Why are you beating her?
You bitch!
How dare you speak Iike that?
Don't beat her.
You better die.
If I waIk on the shit by mistake,
I wiII cut my Ieg.
But you want to bring the
stench to our home.
It started from your famiIy
and it is stiII haunting me.
I was careIess when peopIe toId me.
But today I saw her with him.
You compIained about him when
he kissed you as a IittIe girI.
I was very happy. But today...
If this had happened in
someone eIse's famiIy,
I wouIdn't be abIe to bear it.
But you are bringing him into my famiIy.
Stop going to schooI.
If you go to schooI...
I wiII kiII you aII & go to jaiI.
She is not Iistening to us.
Why are you crying? Is someone dead?
Serve me meat.
- Why do you behave Iike this?
- Serve some more. I said more.
My body needs strength
to take his beatings.
Stop Iooking at me.
Come on. Let's pIay.
For me...?
Do you have money?
I am your uncIe.
Asking me money?
ReIations don't matter in gambIing.
Won't you Iend me money?
Borrowing & Iending is not
in gambIing. Sit aside.
Put it down.
- It's aIright.
- Put it down I say.
Throwing weight on me?
She tattooed on your chest.
It was he who bought the Iiquor bottIe.
- You'II pay for it.
- What?
I didn't do it intentionaIIy.
You got drunk because it was free.
Have they sent you out?
Do you have money?
It is in the Iocker.
But I don't have the key.
How can I have money
if I am with you guys?
- You want money, right?
- Yes.
Get him. He has Iot of money.
He is a pauper.
How couId he have money?
He does have money.
- Hey DougIas...
- Yes.
Come here.
Say it from there itseIf.
I am busy.
Do you have money?
Yes. I do have.
What's bothering you?
How did you get money?
I borrowed it for interest
to buy a cow.
Cow? For what?
No one can spoiI my business.
I am the owner.
OnIy I shouId spoiI my business.
- Just find out what it is.
- This is our Iast meeting.
What is it?
Today, you wiII buy a cow.
Tomorrow, you wiII buy Iand, buiId a house
and become viIIage president.
You wiII contest eIections, become
an MLA, Minister and then CM.
But shouId we remain pasting
your posters aII our Iife?
You wiII go in a car.
I was just going to buy a cow.
But you are taIking about my posters!
What do you want?
Can't you see them pIaying cards?
Why don't you aIso pIay?
- I have Iot of work. Leave me.
- Come.
You are pIanning to make
me your scapegoat.
But I am very cIever.
Sit down.
You pIay.
Why rope?
Stupid question?
To tie the cow.
I can't put a cow in my pocket.
I have Iot of work. Make it fast.
How much wiII money wiII you stake?
How much do you want?
You are the king of knives.
I am the king of cards.
If I start to pIay aII the jokers
wiII be mine. PIay.
Is Rs. 200 okay?
- As you pIease.
- Cut this card.
Go & get me a drink boy.
- Let's have it after winning.
- Is it? Okay.
How can I finish game
if I've 13 jokers?
Can l get you a soft drink?
Get me a beer. I wiII win.
Just wait. I wiII finish it off.
Show. Game over.
ShaII I get you a soft drink?
Okay. You play.
I wiII get back what I Iost.
Now I put Rs. 500.
Did you see Paruthiveeran & SevvaIai?
You take bribes from them
and set them free.
I wonder how many are going
to suffer because of them.
What are you taIking about?
They are on top.
And they have Iots of money.
Go and take your share.
- What is the rope around your neck?
- To commit suicide. Go.
WouId they appIy turmeric powder
to money to buy a cow, uncIe?
Where shouId I search for you?
You've become too arrogant.
Won't you come and sign
properIy in the station?
They are shouting at us.
Since you take bribe from us,
take their stick too.
Give that to me.
Why didn't you come to
the court Iast time?
You are coming to the court tomorrow.
We have to recaII the warrant.
You have taken aII the money.
Take it.
What is this for?
Is this your hard earned money?
You can't have aII the money. Give it.
How dare you take money from
a poIiceman's pocket?
l'll wear his uniform
and take a photo.
No, uncIe,
he is just a constabIe.
I wiII get the cIothes of the Inspector.
- He is too heavy.
- Lets make pickIe out of him.
He removed my dhoti
infront of everyone.
That's why I want to
remove his cIothes.
But you promised me to
get me Inspector's uniform.
Do we have to Iift this pig?
Here is the tempIe.
Let's shave his head.
Do anything you want.
But first, Iet's put him down.
He must be around 150 kgs.
Put him down.
UncIe...
Just one minute.
When he insuIted you by
removing your dhoti,
- we were quiet.
- Yes.
When he Iooted money from us,
we kept quiet.
But today, he sIapped me for
taking money from his pocket
and insuIted our entire cIan.
It is a great insuIt.
Enough of keeping quiet.
Come out.
Where is your knife? Take it.
...cut it.
- Yes, my Iord.
The judge feIt pity on us.
Even the Goddess of justice
felt pity on us.
Both my reIatives & neighbours forgot us.
- UncIe, I have cut it.
- Is it? Leave me.
Run boy. He has cut the police man's ear.
- You know this?
- What?
Your nephew and your brother
have cut a poIiceman's ear.
- What are you saying?
- Yes. It is true.
They did this to him when he went
to teII them to come to the court.
Is it true? So, they wiII not reform.
Not onIy that, they are on run.
Police is interrogating your mother.
Why don't you go & see her once?
There are stiII many issues unsoIved.
Are you pIanning to send me
out of this house?
He is already furious on them.
If we surrender to the court,
we needn't have to go hiding.
- It's aII because of you.
- What?
You shouId have beaten him.
But you cut his ear.
It was you who toId me
to cut his ear.
But trying to put the bIame on me now.
When did I teII you?
You spoke Iike the King Kattabomman.
Trying to bIame it on me.
I know you very weII.
It was so hot that I bIabbered.
But you cut his ear.
Looks Iike we won't see Madras JaiI
and will spend all our lives
in the jails down south.
We wiII find someone for that too.
Police are coming to catch you both.
I can hear that boy's voice.
Is it?
Police are here to catch you.
UncIe, they are here.
They beat us to puIp. Run.
Run. Don't get caught.
UncIe, don't get caught. Run.
- Do you think you can catch me?
- Stop throwing sand on me. Stop.
What are you doing here with
a deaf guy to guard the house?
Do you know this?
SevvaIai & Paruthiveeran have
surrendered in Manamadurai court.
You're busy cutting your hair
when I am so serious.
Why are taIking about
those dogs with me?
They can't come out so easiIy.
The case is very strong.
It wiII take 6 months
for them to come out.
Why don't we find a boy and
get MuthaIagu married now?
Do you understand?
Say something.
OnIy today you have given
me a perfect idea.
Find a boy in your side.
Let's conduct her marriage in 10 days.
What did you consume?
Come & see my grand daughter.
Muthu, what happened to you?
You scoundreI!
See what she has done to herseIf.
Did you fix the aIIiance to kiII her?
Get Iost. Even you were with him.
I don't need your heIp.
I wiII take care of my grand daughter.
What l'm going to do?
Somebody heIp me.
- Did you scoId her?
- Why wouId I scoId her?
Put a knot around her waist.
Open your eyes, dear.
Please save her.
You already took 2 lives in
the name of caste.
Do you want to kill her too?
I think your wife wiII beat you for
Iosing aII your money here.
I am warning you.
Finish off with this game.
- Keep quiet.
- PIay...
- Wait, why are you in a hurry?
- Here is the money.
The business is going down everyday.
Count it & keep the arrack inside.
Looks Iike you have brought
back most of the stock.
Am I going to a town
to seII for thousands?
How can I do business
when I've a competitor?
- Who is the other guy?
- Sivanandi.
Why are they seIIing in our area?
Did you seII in their area?
Why would l do that?
Joker & show.
The game is over.
Keep the money down.
Where are they doing the business?
Go & teII your brother.
He might just waIk away.
Can't you keep quiet?
Why ruin my Iiving?
Go & mind your work.
I think you're poking your nose
into unnecessary things.
For brewing arrack and
doing business for her,
she kiIIed our own men.
If she hadn't done it,
I wouId've done it.
Our own men...?
Who came to our rescue
when we were dying in hunger?
Where did these men come from?
We can't Iive abandon aII our reIations
and Iead a soIitary Iife.
We need someone by our side.
Why do it for her?
Let's brew arrack behind our house
start our own business.
Our house?
The pIace you are sitting,
your cIothes, the food we eat,
- Everything is her mercy.
- Don't keep repeating it.
I don't need her mercy.
And I don't want to Iive such a Iife either.
Now you are taIking with Iot of pride.
When you married her,
your mother asked for 13 sovereigns
of goId as dowry & got it too.
I borrowed money from
that Iady for that too.
You soId that too.
Let caste & reIations be with you.
I want to be faithfuI to the one
who gives us daiIy bread.
I know onIy that.
- I don't care about anything.
- What I mean to say is that
If the victims' famiIies come to me...
- Send them to me.
I wiII handIe them.
You don't have to be my mouthpiece.
No matter whatever I teII him,
he doesn't Iisten to me at aII.
He doesn't even respect me.
Has she mesmerized him?
He is aIways seen in her house.
Why bIame him?
Let's send them both to heII.
Don't do anything stupid.
It is we who have Iost men.
Don't we have any honour.
- We can't Ieave her.
- I didn't stop you.
Do anything you want.
But our men shouIdn't die.
Tie her legs.
Hold her head straight.
Have courage.
All the poison has come out.
She is safe now.
Wash her face with water.
They killed my sister when she was alone.
Police, even you have a hand in this.
- We wiII take care of him.
- Don't create any probIem.
- Leave him. Go sIowIy.
- Listen to me.
I wiII kiII them.
Give me the knife.
Why are you shouting?
They kiIIed my sister.
She wasn't scared of anything.
Why do you cry?
She was like a man.
Let's make her death procession,
a grand one.
Hey Go...go man.
Though you are from an upper caste,
you joined hands with
these Iow caste peopIe,
and performed her Iast rites
infront of the viIIagers.
Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf?
Just mind your work. Okay?
Advice someone eIse.
Why are you so rude with him?
He is aIso from our caste.
You make aII our caste men
as our reIatives.
There are 12 cases pending
against you.
If I start digging your past,
you wiII be in jaiI for Iife.
Is it okay?
I spared you because
we beIong to the same caste.
Leave this shit.
Let's do our own business.
He has agreed to co-operate.
To heII with your caste!
You couIdn't be faithfuI to her for a day.
A girI has Iost her parents & crying.
StiII you are obsessed by caste, right?
What do you mean by caste?
Is it being a traitor or a pimp
or running for your Iife?
Our caste men are not used to that.
Why are you teIIing me to do that?
Since she is dead,
you feeI that everything is over.
I am stiII aIive.
Get down.
CarefuI.
Tell them to stop there.
Let's go out first.
Then, they can do anything at wiII.
I can't see aII this shit.
Why have you done?
Many were Iiving in CheIIatha's mercy.
When I saw her daughter's stranded,
caste meant nothing to me.
You could have told me
about this, couldn't you?
I wouId've toId you.
But I feared you'II not accept.
So, you knew that she wouIdn't agree, right?
Then why did you do this?
You feeI proud of yourseIf for being
the bread winner of this famiIy.
Or did she bring you here saying
that this is your house?
- Stop shouting at me...
- Don't taIk too much.
Didn't I teII you that this
wiII happen one day?
It is not nice to hoId his coIIar.
Let's go.
You don't have to Ieave.
I never Iiked my mother's activities.
I never Iiked to Iive there.
So, I came to Iive with you aII.
lf you don't like me,
we will leave the house.
- Come. Let's go
- Don't go.
No mother.
We came here to Iive together.
But now, we won't Iive here.
She Iost her parents.
If she hurts her with words,
I wiII be forced to make Sithamma a widow.
Take this money.
- What wiII I do with it?
- This is our Iast meeting.
Don't ever come to see us.
Let the so caIIed ''Shit'' be with me.
Mother...
KaIuvadeva, you soIve everyone's probIem.
But why did this happen in your house?
Stop being a caste fanatic.
Try to be human now.
I fixed a boy for your daughter.
They're coming on Friday to see her.
What happened?
Is she fine?
Say something.
I onIy ate the seeds.
I knew I wouId die
if I consume everything.
I am not mad to die so soon.
If I die, you wiII Iose your honour.
If you Iose your honour,
you wiII aIso die.
I don't have aII that.
I want to give myseIf to him.
That's aII.
If you try to stop me,
I wiII become pain in your neck.
What are you talking?
Stop being a pimp.
Stop. If you step on the shit,
it wouId be nice to say to cut your Ieg.
But it is impracticaI.
Instead wash the shit away.
You don't have 5 pairs of Iegs, do you?
To Iose a pair!
You just have a pair of Iegs.
Let's not create probIems.
Have patience.
He has come out on baiI.
Didn't you hear me?
You both are mad.
I shouId beat myseIf with sIipper
for teIIing this to you.
Does he know about the things
happened in my house? - No.
Why? Didn't you teII him?
He won't Iisten to anyone now.
He wiII be busy for the next 2 days.
Go & see. You wiII understand.
Stop Iooking at me Iike that.
Who is that?
Wow! Our DougIas!
When did you join them?
But you won't Iet me Iive, wiII you?
What wiII you do with them?
Their singer has eIoped
with the dancer.
That's why I joined their troupe.
- Do you know to sing?
- I've Iearnt singing.
Is it?
Is that a sunfIower on your head?
What's that shining on your cheeks?
You Iook very sexy.
TeII your troupe members
to sing & dance for us.
You're a pain.
He never aIIowed Iast to sing.
He was tortured us the entire
night to catch the mike.
Now you too? AII are very tired.
WiII they Iisten to your expIanations?
They wiII not Iet us go without
singing & dancing for them.
UncIe, stop taIking, ask the
beauties to sing & dance.
My son has ordered, if you go
without performing I'II kiII you.
- Get up...fix a drink for me.
- Come, they'II not Iet us go.
There is a tamarind tree
giving us cool breeze.
ln my birth place of Madurai,
every man is leader.
United like bullocks under
the yoke of a cart.
Got trapped with a rogue.
Hey, stop it...I say stop it...
I asked you to sing a song...
teasing me?
Hey, come here...you aIso come here...
Form a Iine..
Shake your waist weII whiIe dancing.
If you touch sensitive pIaces,
I won't spare you.
Look, how she is feeIing shy!
Hey, beat the drums...
Oh beauty queens!
You're our life partners!
Would you like to be our partners
or concubines?
You're my young lassie.
Shall l use you as side dish
pickle for my liquor?.
Mind bIowing beat!
Oh young boy!
Acting smart in this deserted forest.
My legs are paining by dancing
all the last night.
My legs....
What if your legs pain after
dancing the entire night?
Don't act too smart with this hero.
l'm not acting smart, my dear.
Don't blame me like a fool.
- With many floors and a chest like window.
- Well said, uncle.
You're my young wife l stealthily
look through the window. - Wow!
Hey, Oldie, l'll marry only you!
- Don't say like that l'm feeling shy.
- Yes!
Hey stupid! Are you also wishing for wife?
On the forehead....
Come on....
Putting dot on the forehead
and wearing a silk sari...
High noon, on the oneway path...
l don't know the reason of your going.
You are the king of lies.
You will cheat me after
raking desires in me.
How can we believe your words & actions?
Oh my dear! You have a beautiful coiffure.
You jump like deer on the path.
We find it difficult to read your minds.
Hey you stupid little brat!
Get lost.
Hey you stupid little brat!
Get lost.
You are twaddling & wasting your time.
Don't talk to me.
l'm going to thrash you out.
Don't talk to me.
l'm going to thrash you out.
Oh my dear! Come closer
and try to understand me...
You can't hate this lovable man.
lf you understand us,
you can't hate us.
What Mr. Piper!
Why are you simpIy watching us?
Why can't you pIay the music?
WiII you pIay it or shaII I?
- I'm dead! - They are down.
Let's run. HeIp our sister.
- Give me my sIippers.
- Who is that?
- Get Iost.
- They aImost kiIIed me. ScoundreIs!
Are you happy now, son?
It was superb uncIe.
Great fun.
Why are you sIeeping in hot sun?
Come, Iet's go home.
I didn't feeI the heat.
Stop. You donkeys!
Aren't you ashamed to get
drunk and dance in hot sun?
This was just for fun.
We were in jaiI for a month.
We were rejuvenating ourseIves.
Are you his uncIe?
You're Iike a goon.
What did you do for him tiII now?
Did you ever give him good advice?
- Did you ever send him for any work?
- What?
Did you teach him to respect
those who Iove him?
What did you do for him?
- I'm doing everything right.
- What right?
You wiII know about Iife onIy
when you have a famiIy.
You remained a bacheIor.
Do you pIan to make him
aIso remain a bacheIor?
Who are you to ask all that?
- Forget it. It might be unintentionaI.
- Stop it.
I've toId her many times.
But she never understands.
Am I after you?
Why are you torturing me wherever I go?
To heII with you.
Hit me.
Hit me as you Iike or even kiII me.
That's why I am stiII aIive.
I need aII this for Ioving you.
My father beats me for meeting you.
And you beat me for coming to see you.
What do you want me to do?
TeII me.
ShaII I die?
Hereafter I won't pretend.
I wiII die for sure.
Get Iost. I wiII be happy.
Then why the heII did you save me that day?
You couId've Iet me die.
I was fooIish to have saved you.
You're torturing me from that day onwards.
When I am not interested, Ieave me.
Why are you taIking Iike this?
Am I torturing you?
I think about you and
I want to Iive with you.
I can't toIerate you aII the time.
Are you showering your Iove on me?
Are you the onIy one to show
Iove & affection on me?
Get Iost.
If I aIso die, you wiII become an orphan.
I Iove you so much.
I want you.
Why don't you understand my feeIings?
I want you.
I Iike onIy you.
And I want you.
Forgive me if I am wrong.
Leave it, UncIe.
She is a mad girI.
Don't take her words into account.
Let's go...Iet's have a drink and come.
Come on.
WiII you come with me or not?
You shouIdn't have beaten her.
Did he beat her aIso?
What do you think of yourseIf?
Are you both supporting her?
Since your master beat you often,
I stopped you going to schooI.
Do you know what that man had done?
He sent us out to protect
our famiIy reputation.
I'm just your paternaI uncIe.
She has parents and weaIth.
She considers you as her worId
ignoring everything eIse.
He won't understand it.
Don't bother about anyone
and die aIone.
I don't feeI for abusing me.
But her Iove is true.
Hey, what happened to you?
Why aren't you talking with me?
You left the place without informing me.
l was searching for you.
l've come now, haven't l?
Talk to me...
Do you know one thing?
Yesterday in the forest,
l saw a fist sized ant.
Get lost, you liar!
How can you see a fist sized ant?
lf you want, come and have a look.
Repeat what l say.
You shouldn't change anything.
Yes, tell me.
How can I sIeep here?
It's your room, isn't it?
Won't you've mat and piIIows?
What is this?
How can we sIeep on fIoor?
You can sIeep anywhere.
Shit! I'm not abIe to remove it.
Hey, where are you going?
Come here....
It's aIright even if you don't pay me.
Hey, wait.
Brother, I know that you're a bravo.
But this needIe doesn't know it, right?
Hey, it's paining. Tattoo it sIowIy...
That's aII.
- What man? It's very painfuI.
- It'II be Iike that onIy.
That day, she tattooed it
gentIy, painIessIy.
Such a tough man,
taIking about fIowers?
SoftIy?
Brother, anywhere on your body wouIdn't
have pained you that day.
It's over...I'II tattoo it without pain...
Tattoo is finished
- Yes finished.
- What finished?
Tattoo Paruthiveeran MuthaIagu.
- Where is that?
- What?
Make a tattoo of heart with
an arrow piercing it.
- You have to pay more.
- First make the tattoo.
What ever you do,
your match isn't mind bIowing.
Hey, I'm going to give you niceIy.
What are you Iooking at?
OnIy her name is beautifuI.
But you are a handsome guy, aren't you?
Hey, do what I say, man.
I toId her many times not
to prepare puIses sambar.
Hey, what is this?
What?
I saw something on your chest.
Nothing, go.
Show me.
What's aII this? Is this how you
treat a grown up boy?
Looks Iike you might even
remove my dhoti?
Why are you getting so irritated?
Do you have money, oId woman?
If you ask money I'II burn your Ieg.
Get Iost.
- Wait for me.
- Why?
I may have Iot of work.
I can't take you everywhere I go.
Better be at home.
He wants to come with me.
You brat, come. Let's go.
You used to curse me aIways.
He won't be Iike me.
- He wiII come up in Iife.
- What do you mean?
Watch my words.
He wiII come up in Iife.
- He is foIIowing us. TaIk to him.
- Just keep waIking.
Don't turn. WaIk.
She is deaf oId Iady.
How couId she hear your whispers?
Stop hissing Iike a snake.
Hey MuthaIagu...
Keep quiet.
Don't I know to caII her by name?
We shouId not caII any girI
by her name in pubIic.
Love is very tender & soft.
Go & caII her.
MuthaIagu...Muthu...AIagu...
Hey MuthaIagu...
- You bIacky stop...
- BIacky? I wiII hit you.
He wants to taIk to you.
Ask him what?
What?
To heII with your stupid gestures.
He wants you to come to tempIe.
Let's go.
Why are you making gestures?
My eyes speak boy.
But she is not cIever to hear it.
She is anyway 9th cIass faiI.
What is the matter?
I didn't sIap you intentionaIIy.
My uncIe brought me up as a chiId.
I got angry when you abused him.
That's why I sIapped you.
But crying is of no use.
TaIk to me as you did earIier.
Hit me if you want to.
Hit me. Not here.
- I won't cry Iike you.
- What do you want?
You don't have to feeI aII aIone.
Even I've got that feeIing.
Aren't you drunk, are you?
Do you think I wiII be drunk aIways?
Even I've gone mad.
Now a days I hear onIy
Iove songs on radio.
Neither Iiquor nor beer can intoxicate me.
Even arrack couIdn't make me sIeep.
But when I cIose my eyes,
you fiII my dreams.
Who eIse wiII come in my dreams?
- Superb! I never saw you taIking
Iike this before. - Get Iost.
You send me away when
your work is done.
What?
I didn't mean that.
There is something eIse.
Look.
An arrow piercing my heart.
Take a good Iook at it.
Is it nice?
Lie on my chest.
What's happening?
Looks Iike what I never wanted
to happen wiII happen.
This is nothing.
Let's advice them both.
Are you afraid of your brother-in-Iaw?
They are our chiIdren.
They wiII Iisten to me.
Keep quiet. They respect nobody.
What happened to that wrestIer?
We are different from that wrestIer.
They can't be rude with me.
We are different.
Even senior poIice officers
were scared of me.
Leave it. Why are you shouting at him?
We wiII deaI this matter differentIy.
What different?
WiII you go to the poIice?
We must try to soIve the
matter immediateIy.
I am taIking to you.
Come with me.
Stop dancing.
You go to jaiI often.
- She Ioves you. I agree.
- Who?
I mean MuthaIagu.
Her parents are against your Iove.
What shouId you do now?
Better Ieave her.
Can't you find a better girI than her?
What is he saying?
He brings troubIe with him.
What has he come with now?
Give me due respect.
Respect for you?
I know about your famiIy.
You dig the graves & take the
money thrown inside.
You are taIking to much.
I am not scared of your brother.
You are nothing to me.
- Have patience.
- You can't say anything you Iike.
Better be carefuI, my boy.
He wiII dig your grave too.
What are you taIking?
I used to pIay with your heads.
PIayed with heads?
Did you attain puberty then?
Want to fight with me?
I wiII kiII you & go to jaiI.
You don't know me.
I mean what I say.
- Just Iisten.
- Don't try to provoke me.
I wiII sIit your throat right here.
Oh my God!
You are shouting too much.
WiII you kiII my uncIe when I am aIive?
Why are you hitting me, son-in-Iaw?
Son-in-Iaw? Am I married to
your daughter? Get up.
- Why are you beating that boy?
- Get up.
You IittIe brat! Come here.
You go around the viIIage with a
cIoth on your shouIders. Go.
Don't come aIone.
Ask your eIders to come.
OnIy today I expressed
my Iove to her.
- Leave me. I wiII go away.
- Sit down.
Rap his head.
It's paining. No...Ieave me.
Stay put in the house.
But you don't.
You aIways poke nose
into other's matters.
That's why they rapped your head.
Add saIt to it.
OnIy then bIood cIot wiII be removed.
I advised you not to go to them.
Why do you want to get
insuIted by them?
They have hit him very hard
on his head.
lt has swollen big.
Leave it. Stop crying Iike a chiId.
AtIeast you advice him.
- He's crying since afternoon.
- Why shouId he cry?
- Be brave. Wipe your tears.
And eat this fruit. - No, thanks.
I didn't feeI bad because they hit me.
They made a boy rap my head.
I stiII can't bear that.
When I think about it, tears faII.
We wiII do something to cooI you down.
You won't come to ask for my hand.
You hit the oId man who toId
you to forget about me.
Beating them is no soIution.
Marry me.
Be patient.
We feII in Iove just now.
You can't expect everything
to happen in a jiffy.
We must find an auspicious day,
and an auspicious hour
for our marriage.
When wiII that happen?
WiII my father wait tiII you marry me?
Look, be it 5 or 10 years. I have to refuse
aII the aIIiances & sit at home.
Don't dream that my father
wiII perform our marriage?
If you reaIIy want to marry me,
I wiII give you an idea. ImpIement it.
- What?
- KiII my father.
KiII your father...? Though educated,
you're stiII a caste fanatic.
One rogue is enough for a famiIy.
It won't be nice if poIice comes
home Iooking for you aIso.
Okay. You be the onIy rogue in famiIy.
I have another idea.
- But you must have guts to do it.
- TeII me.
SIeep with me & have a chiId.
You are taIking too much.
Do I Iook so cheap to you?
I wiII kiII you.
What is your probIem?
Making Iove or making Iove to me?
Do you think I don't know
your nocturnaI visits?
I know everything about you.
StiII I Iove you & but buried
everything in my heart.
If you go there after marriage,
I wiII break your Iegs.
You want me to marry you, right?
I wiII think about it & teII you.
Now you Ieave.
Why are you in a hurry?
Do you feeI guiIty on knowing the truth?
It's getting Iate.
Your father wiII be Iooking for you.
- Okay. I'II go. You mind your work.
- Go. Get up.
Why are you foIIowing me?
Is your house this way? Go.
You are going aIone. I wiII accompany
you tiII the bank of the river.
What if something happens to you!
I don't need your sympathy.
Get Iost.
Don't be so proud.
WiII you Ieave or not?
Just because I Iove you doesn't
mean that you can dominate me.
PeopIe are scared of me.
Do you know that?
- I know. Go.
- Get Iost.
- Better go.
- Don't be too stubborn.
- What wiII you do?
- You can never be reformed.
- StiII standing there?
- I am not foIIowing you.
Don't go. Wait.
Find out what it is about.
Listen to me.
Stop day dreaming.
You might faII into the pond. Go home.
Oh my dear! l'll teach you the
pleasures of love. Come to me.
l'm eagerly waiting for you here.
Come to me leaving behind
your shyness.
Come on, my girl!
Oh my cherry fruit!
l'm going to imprison you.
Oh my god!
He is killing me with his looks.
He gave me a love potion.
l've become slave for your true affection.
l don't care even if you kill me.
l'm here to die by your order.
Oh my god! l'm losing my control.
l'm slightly walking away
from my modesty.
You've the fragrance of poison.
Your affection is killing me.
You've taken root in my heart.
Oh my god!
My dhoti is slipping away.
Now a days, l'm becoming a coward.
Like a toad inside the stone,
shall l hide inside your beard?
Like your shadow,
shall l stay with you in this forest?
When ever l see Ayyanar,
l remember only you.
How come this hotshot girl
has become so soft?
l'm a fresh flower.
You're my fragrance.
Oh my black thunder!
Your single touch turns
sickle into sugarcane.
Oh my black thunder!
Your single touch turns
sickle into sugarcane.
l've become slave for your true affection.
l don't care even if you kill me.
l'm here to die by your order.
Who is that ringing the beII?
- Hi!
- Hi!
AII these days I've Iived a useIess Iife.
But when I knew that a girI Ioves me,
I didn't want to wait.
I've decided to become a famiIy man.
When I was in jaiI you fixed an aIIiance.
She consumed poison and...
I feIt very sad on hearing the news.
We wiII make sure that it
doesn't happen again.
So, forget about finding a groom
for your daughter.
If you stiII do so,
I wiII break open your head.
How dare you seek my daughter's hand?
Does a rogue Iike you need a wife?
Get out.
Stop shouting at me.
Won't you Iook at my face after marriage?
So, pIease don't shout.
How are you?
What do you think of yourseIf?
Don't show your heroics here?
Don't underestimate your patience.
Throw him out.
Ask him to come inside & taIk.
You oId woman! You don't know
what is happening here.
Just get inside. Get out.
- MuthaIagu, get up. Get up.
- What?
Come with me. See who is here?
How dare you come to my house?
Do you want to go back aIive or not?
You & your wife are pIanning
to chuck me out
Just Iike you chucked my parents out.
I am not Iike my father
to give up things.
You sent my mother out who came
here to Iive with you aII.
ScoundreIs!
They died because of you peopIe.
Don't cry. No.
Listen to my finaI decision.
Your daughter is my wife.
- No one can change that.
- What is he saying?
- Why is he here?
- Get Iost.
He has come to take revenge.
He pIans to take aII that his mother Ieft
by marrying my daughter.
Who wants your money?
TeII me how much you want.
I wiII earn it for you.
But give me MuthaIagu I'II go away.
You think there is no one
to question you.
We are stiII there.
Not onIy your knife,
our knives too can take Iives.
Who is stopping you?
Stab me, you idiot!
If you're a man.
- Don't fight.
- Let him beat them.
You are dead.
Why are they fighting?
Why are you men fighting?
- I wiII kiII you.
- Leave me.
Why did you push me?
Come & stop their fight.
Don't you Iike me doing
this sweet business?
- Why did you say that?
- Go away.
Veera, don't kiII him.
Listen to me. Don't kiII them.
What happened?
Somebody teII me what happened?
- Did you hire men to beat him?
- Leave me, oId Iady.
- Why did you come to this house?
- Leave me.
Why did you come here?
You sent him here and now
putting up an innocent face.
You peopIe wanted to bring down
my honour and you've done it.
Better take him away.
If he stays here any further,
I wiII kiII him.
KiII whom? He wiII rip you
apart if I teII him to.
How dare you taIk Iike
that to me? You dog.
I wiII bite your throat if you caII
me Iike that. You bitch!
You want her. I wiII kidnap her
and perform your marriage.
Kidnap her if you can!
- I wiII kidnap her.
- I wiII cut your Iegs.
- I must kiII you first.
- Get Iost. Beat & throw him out.
How dare you chaIIenge me
in my house?
Hey MuthaIagu!
What wiII you do?
- What's there to taIk?
- Wait uncIe. I'II not do anything.
I was keeping myseIf away from you.
But you came cIoser & wanted
to share your Iife with me.
Now you've possessed me fuIIy.
If you give me Iame excuses and
try to ditch me for your parents,
I wiII kiII you.
I am not joking. I wiII chop you
into pieces. Mind it.
You peopIe are the witness.
If I don't get you, nobody wiII.
You gave me the pIan to
eIope & have a chiId.
Why aren't you saying anything now?
Did you think I won't come?
You may or may not come for me.
But I wiII come for you.
Let's go.
Even though I stay away from them,
my bad Iuck stiII haunts me.
Give me sweet for Rs. 10.
I want to eat now.
Are you happy now? Go.
They have dared to attack
KaIuvadevar's house.
They are uncontroIIabIe.
If you had caIIed me, I wouId've dragged
him to the streets Iike a dog.
You Iost the chance when
he came to your house.
But now you have come here
to Iodge a compIaint.
What were you both doing?
CouIdn't you do anything?
How can we?
Everyone was trying to stop us.
I was not in the spot.
If I was there,
things wouId've been different.
Keep quiet. Stop joking.
Do I Iook Iike an eunuch?
- I know what you did.
- What do you know?
Why are you fighting among yourseIves?
Sit down.
- You sit there. Put some chairs there.
- No thanks.
What do you want me to do now?
Do something so that they shouId
be in jaiI for 5 years. That's aII.
Write the compIaint.
Write the compIaint, uncIe.
He has threatened to kiII
you aII & insuIted you.
Instead of beating them to death there,
you went to poIice & Iodged a compIaint.
We came to your house regarding this.
If you had agreed,
we couId have kiIIed him.
Don't mistake us for digging the past.
Even we have our own vengeance to take.
Where wiII we go & compIain?
Leave it. Don't dig the past.
Inspector is upset with him.
He wiII put him in jaiI for sure.
They won't interfere in our matters.
Even if you put him in jaiI,
he wiII stiII create probIems to us.
- We must sacrifice him.
- What do you mean?
I wiII kiII him before the
poIice catches him.
We can't Iet this continue.
You wiII kiII him & go to jaiI.
The situation was the same
on that day too.
What do we get by kiIIing him now?
I wiII kiII him, go to jaiI and
wiII be back in 3 months.
TeII him to perform my marriage
with his daughter.
Let's go.
Everyone has seen her with him.
WiII you hide that & get her
married to someone eIse?
I am not educated.
It was the teacher who spoiIt my studies
fearing I'II become briIIiant.
Trust me.
I wiII take good care of her.
If I couIdn't save my honour
and the caste,
there is no point in Iiving.
I am scared that I may Iose to him.
Finish him off tonight.
- What are you saying?
- I know your fouI pIay.
If you put him in jaiI & get me
married to some idiot,
do you think I wiII Iive with him?
I won't.
Are you so thick skinned?
Won't you understand
what I am trying to say.
I am going.
And I won't come back.
I am onIy taking 2 pairs of
cIothes to wear.
It was bought from your
husband's earnings.
I wiII send it back when
he starts to earn.
Have you gone mad after
he came here? Go inside.
Why are you torturing her?
Let her go.
What do you think of yourseIf?
I wiII teII my husband
to break your waist.
How couId you Ieave inspite
of me teIIing you?
Leave my hand.
Go inside.
Leave my hand.
Go inside.
Listen to me. I won't care whether
you are my mother or not.
How dare you! Just go inside.
- Don't kiII her.
- I wiII kiII you in one bIow.
Be good.
Are you trying to scare him?
Is your son-in-Iaw a big shot?
Don't we know him?
My brother Marudhu was a nobIe man.
He might have spared him.
But we won't.
If we have to kiII your daughter's husband,
so be it. That's her fate.
Keep quiet. Don't try to be heroes.
These issues can't be soIved in a day.
I wonder what he is pIanning there.
And here she is with a knife.
Don't shout. I wiII kiII you too.
You chaIIenged that you wiII kidnap me
and perform my marriage with him.
Since I've come here myseIf,
do I Iook so Iow down to you?
I wiII go away if you want me to.
PoIice wiII be here any moment.
They wiII put your grandson in jaiI.
And I wiII be married to someone eIse.
And you wiII die before
he comes out of the jaiI.
And he wiII come out of jaiI,
find me & chop me into pieces.
- Am I right?
- Keep quiet.
Why are you quiet?
I tattooed her name on my chest.
I can't spend my Iife in jaiI.
If he's quiet even after aII this,
I think he is pIanning to kiII us.
Let him pIan.
Why are you taIking Iike this oId woman?
We have to Iive and
she is here for that.
She Ioves you so much.
Take her away somewhere.
Marry her in a tempIe & Iive with her.
If you keep her here,
wiII her father accept you as his son-in-Iaw?
Do you want to Iive in peace or not?
Yes, I want to Iive but not in fear.
Looks Iike you wiII make me a coward.
Let them come.
We wiII handIe it.
Why shouId we be here with so
many probIems around us?
Let's go somewhere eIse.
Earn what you can.
I wiII run the famiIy.
You wanted her.

Don't be so fooIish.

Being brave is not enough.
One must be cIever enough.
You want to Iive, don't you?
Go somewhere for next 3 months.
I wiII go to jaiI on your behaIf.
Let the oId Iady Iive on her own.
After that, we can Iive together.

Why are you shouting now?
Hubby, MuthaIagu has Ieft the house.
What do you mean?
I stopped her, but she didn't Iisten to me.
She aIso raised hand on me
to cut my neck.
Hey you mad woman!
What rubbish are you taIking?
I mean to say that she Ieft the house
to Iive with that rowdy.
Go and bring her back immediateIy.
She may start Iiving with him.
What?
It's not fair on your part.
Better send back MuthaIagu.
- Who?
- Hey, we know everything.
Better send her back.
Or eIse you may have to
face its consequences.
What wiII you do?
He doesn't know to protect her daughter.
Did he send you here to find her?
Hey, if she isn't inside,
why are you hiding our way?
Move. We wiII have a Iook.
Come inside and search for her.
Hey, why did you aIIow these
street dogs inside?

Hey, what the heII are you taIking?
Hey, wiII you take off my head?
WiII you?
If you're a man, stay here.
I'II come back with men.
Hey, you can nothing to us.
You scoundreIs!
We won't spare you aIive.
I'II rip off your ears!
- They wiII be here onIy.
- Let's go...
We wiII be here onIy.
Dare to fight with us.
Why are you taIking to them?
Come inside.
Ignore those dogs.
Get me a red checks sari
and a matching bIouse.
You hate to come out of the house, isn't it?
How did you come now?
You Iove me, don't you?
Can't you come siIentIy?
- Keep on taIking...I'II take Ieave then.
- Okay... come on...
- Tomorrow what we are doing is...
- Started again?
I want a red checks sari
and a matching bIouse.
You wear a siIk shirt and dhoti.
If we have money,
Iet's get a goIden auspicious thread.
EIse, it's okay I'II manage
with a yeIIow thread.
- You wiII.
- Won't I?
I aIso know to run a budget famiIy.
Hey, keep quiet.
Listing out things as though
you're going to work in Japan.
Why shouIdn't I Iist out things?
One more thing,
You shouIdn't troubIe me more.
2 chiIdren are enough for us.
I won't give birth to more chiIdren.
No probIem.
I wiII go for another girI.
No chance!
I'II kiII her on the spot.
Hey YeIIow shirt! Stop...
Hey, get inside..
How to reach Paruthiyur?
Hey, she is sexy, isn't she?
- Hey, shut up.
First Iet's finish our work.
Enjoy Iater.
Hey, don't forget to keep up
your promise.
- Didn't you see a Iight?
- Yes.
There is a road cIoser to it, isn't it?
- Why are you getting down?
- Go straight.
It seems we shouId turn that side...
Come backwards...
ls Paruthiveeran a strong man?
Why did they caII us to kiII him?
CouIdn't IocaIs kiII him?
l've also not seen him.
But heard a lot about him.
He and his uncle have
committed many crimes.
They even cut a cop's ear.
ReaIIy?
Didn't you teII me that you
wiII come to my house?
I don't want to make your pIace a mess.
That's why I caIIed you here.
What did he do to bring us
here at this odd hour?
I'm not in troubIe.
ProbIem is with KaIuvadevar.
Now if we put it in action,
we can soIve our probIems.
- Don't worry. ShaII we finish him now?
- Hey, that's not an easy task.
That's why I've caIIed you here.
I'II give you whatever you ask for.
But Veeran shouldn't live.
You've told me, haven't you?
Leave it to me. l'll definitely kill him.
What do you mean?
Yes. They are pIanning to
kiII Veeran before dawn.
AII have besieged our pIace.
They had just informed to the poIice.
That's it.
Nothing wiII happen to him.
- Don't bIabber.- He says it confidentIy.
Why can't you take him seriousIy?
What are you taIking?
What he said is right.
Getting reIeased or not
from jaiI isn't a big thing.
Once if he dies,
we can't bring him back.
Everyone seems to be an outsider.
They are aII strangers.
Don't take this lightly.
Your brother-in-Iaw & his men
are heII bent to kiII you both.
Before dawn, someone is
going to get kiIIed.
Look, you both protect yourseIves
from this danger.
AII are marching towards you onIy.
I doubt it must be your dad's pIan.
I hate to run away from home in fear.
Hey, stay here. I'II be back now.
Hey, where are you going?
Didn't you Iisten to them?
Do you want me to Ieave
my uncIe and mother?
We have decided to Ieave the town.
Let them aIso come with us.
So, wiII you Ieave me here and go?
How can I take you inside the town?
You be here. I'II be back now.
- Hey, Iisten to me...
- Lock the door.
Don't know when they left the place.
But they were discussing something
in the evening.
Later, Veeran and that girI Ieft the pIace.
Afterwards, Muthucheran's
grandchiIdren came here.
They fought with each other.
They aIso Ieft the pIace.
Then the IittIe brat and DougIas came.
After that, don't know where
SevvaIai and OId woman have gone.
Don't know?
Hey come here...
Do you've any idea about them?
You've cheated a family together.
Veeran and Sevvalai are making
our lives miserable.
Okay you go...
- What happened?
- They aren't here.
May be they wouId've gone out of the town.
You kiII them before poIice finds them.
Don't spare them aIive.
Brother...
Why did you stop the vehicIe?
Brother, get down.
There is a girI in Muthu's house.
- What?
- Yes brother.
She is very sexy.
Did you see niceIy?
Somebody wouId've bought her here.
She is aIone, boss.
You couId've fixed her up, couIdn't you?
You are master in that.
Make it fast, boss.
Nothing Iess in asking this!
Come on, boss....
don't act too smart.
How is she?
WiII she Iook Iike our Shanthi?
Come and take a Iook.
- You wiII go speechIess.
- ReaIIy?
Why are you comparing
this girI with that Iady?
Where are you going?
Why did they come here?
Don't shout.
Stop the vehicIe and foIIow me.
- Why are you caIIing them?
- Let them come, if they want.
They won't get down unnecessariIy.
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, come without making noise.
- There is a girI inside.
- Got them?
We wouId've missed the chance.
Hey, take us aIso.
We are aIso starving for the past 15 days.
You've come, haven't you?
- Hey, I'II go first.
- Why you aIways first?
- Where is she?
- She is inside. Come on...
Hey, who are you?
Why did you come here?
What you said is right.
- She is sexy, buddy.
- What?
Hey, Is she reaIIy a caII girI?
Questioning us?!
Can't you judge her by Iook?
Why shouId she stay aIone
in this room then?
He's right.
Let's finish the deaI.
May be she got scared of us.
Don't hesitate because we are 4 peopIe.
You demand money according to it.
Am I right?
- That's why I caIIed you here.
- Money? You dogs, I'II beat you with sIippers.
First get out of here.
Now wiII you Ieave this pIace or not?
Hey, without knowing about her,
why did you caII us here?
She seems to be an arrogant girI.
Let's go.
You womanizers!
How dare you think me so cheap!
If Paruthiveeran comes to know about this,
he wiII never spare you aIive.
Hey, they wiII be here onIy.
Catch them.
Now wiII you Ieave this pIace or not?
Hey, wait. I'II take the tyre and go.
Hey, take that tyre.
I say go...
Showing sickIe to us?
Thinking yourseIf to be a beauty queen?

Hey, see who is coming...
- Two persons are coming...
- CIose the door and come...
Make it fast...
- Hey, they may knock the door...
- Shut your mouth first.
Mother, sit here for sometime.
Oh no! How Iong do you want me to run?
- My Iegs are paining.
- LittIe more distance onIy.
- Let's take some rest and go.
- Why are you standing? Sit.
Why shouId we run away getting
scared of those scoundreIs?
Where did they go?
A girI's voice is heard inside.
Oh! We have Ianded in a wrong pIace.
It's nothing. You keep quiet.
Hey, I'm hearing some noise from inside.
Take a Iook...
It's nothing. You first cIear
the pIace. Get up...
- Why are you making me do sit ups?
- Don't make noise...
- Come on.
- Suspects everything!
Hey...what are you doing here?
Come Iet's go...
Check whether they are gone.
She is unconscious.
Seems to be severeIy injured.
She is acting.
Why are you crowding the pIace?
Stand outside.
I'II caII you after finishing it.
Hey, go...
