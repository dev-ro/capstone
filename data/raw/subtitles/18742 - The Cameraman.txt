When acclaiming our modern heroes,...
...let's not forget...
...The News Reel Cameraman...
the daredevil who defies death to...
...give us pictures of
the world's happenings.
And there are other types of photographers.

Do you know who that is?
Maybe it's Lydia Pinkham.
Do you know her?
What are you doin'...
givin' me a sleigh-ride?
No charge. It's a present.
I'd like to have you sit for
another portrait...
...when you get off.
I wont' be through for three hours.
I'll wait.
I'm a photographer. Could I get a job here?
Get a job here...
with that cocktail shaker?
You'll have to buy your own camera...
...before they'll give you a trial here.
Don't close up! I'll be right back!
What are you doing here?
None of your business!
I'm waiting to see the boss!
Well, I'm the boss!
Well, make me an offer.
The Grand Central Warehouse is on fire!
You ought to go photograph the fire, too.
They'll buy any good film...
...so photograph
anyting that's interesting.
It's your chance to break in!
I'll bust in all right! Watch me!
Where's the fire?
Up there there's a fire
down here, the said..
In which house?
No! It's not in a which house.
It's in a warehouse!
Now, where is it?
Where's what?
Where's the which house?
I mean, which's the warehouse?
Which warehouse, where?
Within an hour...
...he was photographing everything...
...from soup to nuts.
Mosty the nuts.
Aren't the Yankees playing today?
Sure...
...in St. Louis!
Don't be discouraged.
No one would ever amount to
anything if he didn't try.
You must always grind
forward, never backward.
I'll make good next time!
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Maybe you'll let me take you...
...for a nice long walk.
I'm sorry, I have a sort of date.
But give me your phone  number...
...I may call you.
I'll be waiting.
From the peek of dawn on Sunday morning.
My date's off, and-
I'm sorry if I'm a little late.
This is the young man who is
to take Sally walking.
This is my dressing room!
Shut up or it'll be your coffin!
Will you keep out of my undershirt?
Hey! What is this,
a suit or a bib?
The Big Sea Lion!
I'll show you some
real fancy diving!
Let's get out of here and
go walking on the beach.
Help! I've been robbed
Hello, Sally! Come on,
I'll drive you home.
But we couldn't have him in here with us.
There's never room for three.
I'm a little damp
so I'll go home..
I'm sorry you got so wet.
It was worth it to be near you.
Where do you live and where do you work?
Did you ever find that flame
you were looking for?
Oh, she's so beautiful!
I'll try your reflexes to
see if you're goofy.
Monday morning.
There'll be nothin' for you! Beat it!
Randall talking.
This Chinese celebration
may be interesting.
Send a man down.
Chinatown is celebrating a holiday.
It may be worth taking. Go on down.
I'll make good this time, Sally.
Now, see! You kill-a de monk!
Pay jim for that baboon or I'll run you in!
It's yours. You bought it.
Get it out of the way!
If the Wung Fa Tong stars anything...
...you know what to do!
I took the whole blamed war!
I got some great pictures of
that Tong War all right.
Pretty short war!
I guess I forgot to put film in the camera.
Say, how did you get wise to that Tong War?
Miss Sally told me.
Did you give him the tip, young lady?
It's all your fault that this fool
has been hanging around here!
Don't leave me because of me.
I'll never bother any of your again.
Tueasday morning.ý
The Westport Yacht Club Regatta
Did you change this film box in Chinatown?
Look out you don't get thrown
out when I make this turn.
You're awfully brave to have saved me.
What else could a fellow do?
Wednesday morning.
That little cameraman left this film here.
He said you can have it for nothing.
It's the Tong War!
That's the best camera
work I've seen in years!
Get that man here quick!
I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Everybody talking about you!
They're all waiting to...
...give you a great reception!
