PETE: "This is...
"the story of a puppy.
"His name is...
"El-i..."
- Elliot.
- "Elliot.
"His name is Elliot."
You got it.
"He is going on an...
"adventure..."
- An adventure.
- What's that?
An adventure?
You don't know what an adventure is?
What we're on right now.
Out here in the wild,
not another soul in sight
for hundreds of miles...
with just the stars to guide us.
Is it scary?
That's the other thing about adventures.
You gotta be brave.
Are you brave?
Of course you are.
I think you are the bravest boy
I've ever met.

Go North, go North
With wings on your feet
Go North with the wind
Where the three rivers meet
There's a clearing of sorts
In the circle of trees
(INAUDIBLE)
Where the wild constellations shine
One two and three
Look all around you and see
Deep in the forest there dragons will be
MEACHAM: As long as
people have been
going into these woods...
there have been stories
about the Millhaven dragon.
How does that song go again?
They come from the North, right?
Way up there in the mountains
where few people have ever been.
But sometimes,
a dragon gets lost from its family...
and winds up very, very far from home.
They say it lives in these very woods.
That you can hear its roar at night.
They say this, they say that,
but, as far as I know...
not one soul has ever
actually seen this dragon.
- Except me.
- (CHILDREN GASP)
You saw a dragon?
I sure did.
Ooh.
I sure did.
What'd it look like?
Well, it was green.
Green all over.
- Except for his eyes.
- JENNY: My favorite color!
His eyes were red. Like hellfire.
Before I could even blink...
it rears back its head,
opens its mighty jaw...
and shoots out...
(CHILDREN GASP)
(CHILDREN CHUCKLING)
So, I wasn't gonna waste my breath.
I rolled out the way,
scrambled to my feet...
ready for the fight that was gonna come.
But as I raised my rifle...
the dragon comes at me
with one swipe of its claw...
knocks the gun right out of my hands.
Now, what?
Things are really not looking good here.
But I wasn't gonna be done. Not yet.
I just took out my pocket knife...
And as the dragon set upon me...
(CHILDREN GASP)
I drove it home.
Whoa!
GRACE: Scaring the kids again, Dad?
No, no, no. I was just
giving them a leg up...
on what's out there in those woods.
Well, I'm out in those woods every day...
and while I have seen
bears and bobcats...
and just about every type
of bird you can imagine.
I have never seen a dragon.
Just because you don't see something,
doesn't mean it's not there.
And just because you say it's true,
doesn't mean it is.
- (CHUCKLES)
- (CHILDREN EXCLAIM)
But, I'm headed out there right now.
I'll let you all know if I see anything
big and green and breathing fire.
Mr. MEACHAM, I believe you.
Well, I'm glad you do.
See, my daughter...
she knows a thing or two
but only if it's staring
at her in the face.
If you go through life
only seeing what's
right in front of you...
you're gonna miss out on a whole lot.
See, and that's where
you guys have the upper hand.
Because mark my words...
that dragon is still out there.
(GROWLING)
And if you were to go
out there to those woods...
where no one ever goes...
then you might find him.
Unless, he found you first.

Don't worry about Jack.
Just keep cutting.
GRACE: Who said it was
okay to be here?
MAN 2: I just go where they tell me.
GRACE: Where's Jack?
MAN 2: There he is!
This is so out of line, Jack.
You're not supposed to be cutting
anywhere near this deep.
I didn't know anything about this either.
This wasn't my call, Grace.
Then, whose was it?
Of course.
JACK: Let me handle this, please?
GRACE: You don't handle it.
That's the problem.
JACK: You're right, and Gavin is Gavin.
He's my brother.
Hey, I have to get to school.
JACK: Could you wait
in the truck, sweetheart?
We'll just be a minute.

Let's review them.

Pete.
You look like a Pete.
- My name's Natalie.
- JACK: Natalie!
NATALIE: Daddy!
JACK: Natalie!
Daddy!
What were you thinking?
You can't run away like that.
What happened to you?
I fell out of a tree.
You fell out of a tree?
What were you doing in a tree?
Following him.
Oh.
NATALIE: His name is Pete.
Hey.
Pete? Is that your name?
Pete?
Wait, wait, wait!
Where'd you come from?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Do you know where your parents are?
Your family?
Hey.
Where'd you get that?
Wait!

Hey, kid! Come back here.

(CALLING OUT)
JACK: Doesn't matter.
The sheriff, the rangers, everybody else
are gonna be locking this site down...
until they figure out
where that kid came from.
Hey, you hear that?
Don't change the subject, Gavin.
GAVIN: Every time I try
and take some initiative...
you shut me down.
If we hadn't been cutting out here...
we never would've found
that kid in the first place.
We're doing good work here, Jack.
And we need a big score
to help us compete.
What about a few years from now...
when we have nothing left to cut down
because you keep jumping the gun?
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?
(ENGINE STARTS)
You're not the only family
I gotta worry about.
Let me know how Pete's doing, will ya?
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
What's wrong, Gavin?
Jack giving you a hard time?
Oh, you know Jack.
He's just sore because
his girlfriend's stepping on his toes.

SHERIFF DENTLER: How's he doing?
DR. MARQUEZ: Pretty well,
all things considered.
No signs of malnourishment
or serious exposure.
He might have a bump to the head, but...
- Lucky kid.
- Super lucky.
How'd he get out there?
My guess, he was
on a picnic or a camping trip.
He wandered off from his family,
got himself lost.
Sure, but when?
It looks like he's been out there
for who knows how long.
And he had this.
You sure that's yours?
Pretty sure.
Here we are. All fixed up.
Hey, there. How you feeling?
It was just a scrape. Where's Pete?
I'm gonna take Natalie home,
then head back out to the forest.
Maybe there's something out there...
some clue, or something.
Could you call me when he wakes up?
DR. MARQUEZ: Of course.
When he wakes up,
I think it would be best
to take things slowly.
One step at a time.
Let him know he's safe.
We don't know what he's been through.
SHERIFF DENTLER:
We put in a call in to Social Services.
They'll know exactly how to handle this.
For the time being,
he'll be just fine right here.
NATALIE: Um...
Actually, he's gone.
- Who's gone, sweetheart?
- Pete.

Need a little help?
GRACE: Pete, no! Wait!
NATALIE: Wait!
Wait! Wait, wait.
You are fast.
Oh, my goodness.
What's wrong, honey?
Are you hungry?
Let's go inside.
Let's go get something to eat.
I want to go home.
I know.
Where is your home?
Can you tell me?
How about this?
If you come inside with me now,
then tomorrow...
I'll take you back out to the woods
and you can show me
exactly where you live.
How does that sound?
You know, when I was a little girl...
I wanted to live
in the forest more than anything.
I loved being out there.
It was so fun with the squirrels
and the birds and the trees.
So, when I grew up...
I made it my job to protect the woods
and everything in them.
Which I suppose includes you.
(CHUCKLES)
And Elliot?
Who's Elliot?
JACK: Grace?
JACK: Are you sure about this?
It's just until
we found out where he belongs.
Who knows?
Maybe being around someone
his own age will help him open up.
Maybe he'll tell us where he came from.
You don't touch it. You eat it.
Like this.
JACK: I gotta admit...
living out in the woods,
doing things his own way...
sounds like a boy after your own heart.
ABNER: I think we're lost.
BOBBY: Ah, Gavin knows
what he's doing.
WOODROW: You said
that three miles ago.
BOBBY: The river's
up around that bend.
We can just follow that,
and we'll be back where we started.
WOODROW: The river's back that way.
We've been going in circles.
ABNER: I've never
been out this far before.
WOODROW: Do you
know where we are?
BOBBY: Look at this. (LAUGHS)
WOODROW: What on Earth?
ABNER: You've got to see this.
You think that kid did all this?
What would a kid be doing this far out?

It was a monster demon.
It was a dragon!

That's me, and that's my dad.
That's his brother.
There's Grace. That's my family.
Family.
That's what we are.

Everything to gain and nothing to lose
Mmm...

and now you're five years old.
You know you got to get going

Now you're six, and now you're seven,
now you're eight, now you're nine...
and now you're 10.
(MUFFLED SPEECH)
(MUFFLED LAUGHTER)
And it's a good day for curing your ills
So take a deep breath
and throw away the pills
'Cause it's a good day
from morning till night
I was out here, at the Eastern Pad.
That's the last time
I remember having my compass.
- But that's...
- Fifty miles east.
From where we found him.
Good morning sun
Good morning sun
Rise and shine today
You know you got to get going
If you're gonna make a showin'
And you got the right of way
I haven't read that book in forever.
Someone gave it to me when
I was learning how to read.

It's okay, buddy.
It's just a phone.
It's a good day from morning till night

Is this Elliot, Pete?
Is Elliot a person?
No.
Well, what is he, then?
Grace, it's the Sheriff.
He wants to talk to you.
Hello?
Hey, Grace. How's our mystery boy?
Still a mystery.
Any news?
Well, Pat went digging through
our missing persons files.
He had to go pretty far back...
but it's not good news.
GRACE: Poor Pete.
SHERIFF DENTLER: I know.
I just got off the phone
with Social Services.
They're gonna take custody
of him tomorrow morning.
NATALIE: Pete...
is Elliot your imaginary friend?
What's imaginary?
It's where you
make someone up in your head...
so that you have someone to talk to.
It keeps you from being lonely.
Are they funny?
Sure.
Do they fly?
I guess they can do
whatever you want them to.
That's what makes them imaginary.
Are you my imaginary friend, too?
I'm real.
So is Elliot.
Good job, buddy.
(BUILDING RUMBLING)

PETE: I need to get back to him.
He gets scared when I'm gone.
He looks like a dragon.
What's a dragon?
That's a dragon.
Like the song.
PETE: What song?
NATALIE: There's a song
that my dad used to sing.
It's about dragons and where they live.
Go North, Go North
With wings on your feet
Go North with the wind
Where the three rivers meet
Now plant yourself down
side the tallest tree
Measure the stars
shining one two and three
Look all around you and see
Deep in the forest there dragons will be
Deep in the forest there dragons will be
PETE: What's North?
NATALIE: It's a direction.
PETE: How do you get there?
NATALIE: You could look at a map.
Or you could follow the North Star.
If you follow it
as far as you possibly can...
you get to the mountains.
And that's where you'd find them.
The dragons, I mean.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hey.
I haven't heard that song in forever.
Natalie, do you think
I could talk to Pete alone for a moment?
Okay.
See you in a minute, Pete.
Hey, come here.
You found this for me, didn't you?
Where the trees ran away.
My dad gave this to me
on my 10th birthday...
so that if I ever got lost,
I'd know how to find my way back home.
Pete, honey...
do you remember how
you got to the woods?
It was a long time ago, wasn't it?
We were on an adventure.
You know...
I lost my mom
when I was not much older than you.
I know how hard it can be.
But I want you to know,
you are not alone.
I know.
You do?
I have Elliot.
Can you tell me more about Elliot?
Who is he?
He's my friend.
This is Elliot?
He must be a very special friend.
He doesn't like most people.
But I think he'd like you.
He would?
You'll see. Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
When I go home.
You're coming with me, right?
Of course.
You're very brave.
Did you know that?
You might be the bravest boy
I've ever met.

What happened to you?
You remember those stories
that MEACHAM used to tell us?
About dragons?
He wasn't making them up.
We tracked it,
and there was a treehouse.
I tried to shoot it,
but it just ripped the gun
right out of my hands...
and bent it like it was nothing.
Gavin, I can't just head out
to the woods in the middle of the night...
because you think you saw a dragon.
Think I saw? Jack, I know what I saw.
Yeah.
You don't believe me.
JACK: I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll call the forestry,
we tell them what you saw,
and then they can go and deal with it.
Fine. I get the picture.
I thought I could count on family.
Gavin.
Don't worry. See you in the morning.

"Elliot has..."
Wait.
This isn't how I tell it.
Would you like me to stop?

Oh. You scared me.
Why aren't you asleep?
The same reason you're not, I suppose.
I guess you heard about the boy.
I did.
You know, word travels fast in this town.
How long has he been out there?
Six years.
Six years?
Nobody can survive
in that forest for six years.
At least not alone.
Well... He says...
He says he wasn't alone.
He drew this?
He says it's his friend from the forest.
And it reminded me of...
I know what it reminded you of.
That one?
GRACE: Oh.
How old was I when
you drew this for me?
Uh, maybe five or six.
Just before your mother passed away.
I remember then,
you hung on every word I ever said.
You were so full of questions.
Dad.
MEACHAM: Hmm?
What did you really see out there?
Please, don't tell me another story.
Just tell me what you remember.
(SIGHS)
What I remember?
What I remember is, I was out hunting...
and the sun was shining down...
and wind was blowing through the trees.
And I remember thinking,
"Boy, this is exactly where I belong."
I stopped by a creek to get a drink.
Suddenly I realize
I wasn't in the sun anymore...
and I looked up to see
what was blocking the sky.
And what did I see but a dragon?
I see a dragon.
I've never been so scared in my life.
But when I raised my gun to shoot...
suddenly there was this feeling, this...
It was like magic.
There's no other word to express it.
It was magic.
So, I put my gun down
and just sat there...
and we sat there across the creek
from each other just looking.
I just sat there looking.
And then the dragon turned
and disappeared into the woods.
And I remember thinking,
"I am one lucky guy."
Of course, nobody believed me.
I knew what people
were saying about me.
I must admit, there were times
when I thought, "Maybe they're right."
But then I thought about the magic.
It changed the way I see the world...
the way I see trees,
the way I see sunshine...
the way, even, I see you.
I wouldn't trade that for anything.
So, I'm not gonna try to
convince you. I quit that.
But maybe if you
could just be open to looking.
I know those woods.
I know those woods
like the back of my hand.
I couldn't have missed a dragon.
Well, you missed Pete.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Call me if you need anything.
We'll be fine.
You sure?
Absolutely.

Any way you made it was just fine
So you'd turn your days into nighttime

You can make it
without ever even trying
And something's on your mind
Isn't it?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, I just got turned around.
Hey, Pete...
I was thinking
maybe we could bring someone with us.
Someone who might know Elliot, too.
Is that okay?

Isn't it?
Maybe another day
You wanna feel another way
You can't stop crying

Hey, Calvin. You seen Gavin?
Uh, he and Woodrow took a truck

Oh, tell the truth now
Something's on your mind
GRACE: Kids, hold on a second.
Something's on your mind
Elliot!
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
I've never seen this part
of the forest before.
PETE: Come on!
Cool.
How did you do this by yourself?
Elliot helped. I think he's hiding.
Elliot?
Oh, no, Pete, wait...
- I'm going in after him.
- MEACHAM: Grace, wait.
Give it a minute.
Grace?
(GASPS)
Dad.
Dad.
PETE: Come on.
What did I tell you? Magic.
Elliot.
(EXCLAIMS)
(WHISPERS) What did I tell you?
- (GROWLING)
- I got him!
- Gavin?
- Grace?
(ROARING)
- No! No, wait!
- GRACE: Stop!
Get those kids outta here!
GAVIN: Don't kill him! Tranqs only!
MEACHAM: Gavin, what are you doing?
GRACE: He's not dangerous!
He's not gonna hurt... Stop!
- GAVIN: I got him!
- No!
- NATALIE: No!
- Stop!
- (GROWLS)
- Elliot!
(ALL GRUNTING)
(ALL GROANING)
Here we go! Come on, get up!
No!
GAVIN: Bobby, take the shot!
(BOTH GRUNTING)
PETE: Stop! Elliot!
Fly!
(INAUDIBLE) Come on!
Come on! Go! Go!
Elliot.
(GROANS)
Watch out!
(WOOD CRACKING)
(GRUNTS)
What is that?
Daddy?
Natalie?
Gavin, what is this?
This is the Millhaven dragon.
And I just caught it.
What's the matter, boys?
Ain't you ever seen a dragon before?
Come on.
Pull it into the warehouse.
Into the warehouse.
(INAUDIBLE)
GAVIN: (DISTANT)
Check it out, boys. Check it out!
Pete, Grace didn't
mean for this to happen.
GAVIN: She's a beauty, isn't she?
Or he? It? Whatever it is.
Just trust me.
Get here as quick as you can.
Natalie...
I need you to
wait here with Pete for a minute, okay?
What's going to happen to Elliot?
JACK: I don't know,
but I'm going to go find out, okay?
I just need you to stay here.
Okay? Will you stay here for me?
- Okay.
- Thank you, sweetie.
Pete, we'll fix this.
I promise.
MEACHAM: Okay, then.
Now you've caught it.
What do you plan to do with it?
- What am I going to do with it?
- Yeah.
GAVIN: I know exactly
what I'm going to do with it.
You don't have a clue, do you?
GAVIN: Okay, look.
I haven't got it totally figured out yet.
But I'll tell you this much.
This thing is gonna put me on the map.
Folks will come
from miles to see this.
- Gavin.
- Jack can have the mill.
The dragon is mine.
(ELLIOT GROANS)
No, no, no! Stop. Stop.
PETE: What are they doing to him?
They're trying to find out
what he is and where he came from.
And why they've never seen him before.
JACK: Hey, what are you doing?
Get those guns out of here.
PETE: He came from
the woods, just like I did.
JACK: Are you serious?
PETE: Why can't they just let us go?
We'll go away.
We'll never see anybody again.
It'll be just like it used to be.
But I don't wanna never see you again.
GAVIN: Are you insane?
You have no idea
what this thing is capable of.
JACK: And you do?
GAVIN: Yeah.
GAVIN: If he wakes up,
he could take out the whole town
and everyone in it.
Jack, he's a monster.
MEACHAM: It's not a monster.
It's an animal.
And it's hurt and it's scared.
Grace, wait.
You need help.
You need Pete.
(GASPS)
Did you see that?
Did you just see that?
I sure did.
(SIREN WAILING)
Let's go.
(WHISPERS) Up there.
JACK: Guys, move. Sheriff!
- Sheriff! Sheriff!
- SHERIFF DENTLER: Jack.
No, out of the way. Back off. Sheriff!
Out of the way! Sheriff!
Thanks for coming.
SHERIFF DENTLER:
Jack, what's so big
I had to call out the cavalry?
You really have to
come inside and see this.
- Gavin.
- Let me just say one thing first here.
What my brother called you about...
belongs to me, okay?
I caught it fair and square.
So, if anyone tries to tell you
any different, it's mine.
It belongs to me.
MAN: I wanna see!
SHERIFF DENTLER:
Why are we standing outside?
Can we go in and take a look at it?
(GROANS)
Elliot, are you okay?
MAN 1: What's going on in there?
GAVIN: Now, I gotta warn you.
This thing is dangerous.
Me and my crew are the only ones
who know how to deal with it.
So, when you get in there,
just stay calm.
Don't startle it.
Don't want anyone
getting eaten on my watch.
GRACE: Gavin, wait.
GAVIN: Listen, Grace,
we're not in the forest anymore,
so what's in there...
SHERIFF DENTLER:
You can sit out here...
and talk about "what's in there"
until you're blue in the face.
I just want to see it. Now step aside.
(PETE GRUNTS)
MAN 2: We're waiting
over here. Come on.
MAN 3: Push it open.
- What's the deal here?
- (PETE GRUNTS)
GAVIN: Excuse me, Sheriff.
Seems to be stuck.
Okay, come on. Who's in there?
- (BANGING ON DOOR)
- Hey, open up.
PETE: Elliot.
Can you fly?
- MAN 4: Hit it harder!
- (BOTH GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING CONTINUES)
I don't see anything.
- GAVIN: It was right here.
- What was right here?
It got out.
Come on, we gotta find it! Make a hole!
What got out?
You gotta see for yourself. Come on.
(ALL CLAMORING)
(GASPS)
GAVIN: Abner, check the yard.
Woodrow, take the south side.
Sheriff, can you
get your men to spread out?
We need to call in a chopper,
because this dragon can fly.
A dragon?
Jack, you dragged me all the way
out here for a dragon?
I don't know how to explain it,
but he's telling the truth.
It was here.
It's still in there.
- What?
- (WHISPERS) The dragon.
The dragon is still in there.
We have to help them.
Whoa.
How do we get him out of here?
Do you know how to drive?
Sort of,
but my dad's truck doesn't
have this many buttons.
Stop what you're doing, young lady.
Your feet don't even reach the pedals.
Scoot over.
Wait!
I don't want to hurt your friend, son.
I just want to help.
Get in.
Okay, let's see here if this...
(ENGINE STARTS)
Hey, old buddy.
You better buckle up.
Hold on tight!
(ENGINE REVVING)
I thought I put it in reverse.
Oh, my...
That isn't real, is it?
Follow that dragon!
(ALL CLAMORING)
Hey! Hey!
Sorry about that.
(SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE)
Tell that dragon to hang on.
We've got company.
SHERIFF DENTLER: Attention all units.
We're eastbound
on Millhaven Road in pursuit of a...
A dragon! It's a dragon!
You can't say dragon over the radio.
(HONKING)
Elliot!
Fly!
Come on.
(GROANS)
Faster!
BOBBY: That's MEACHAM!
Pull over!
Hey, pull over!
Not a chance!
That's my dragon!
ALL: Whoa...
ABNER: He's not slowing down.
WOODROW: He's not stopping.
GAVIN: He'll stop.
That fool's out of his mind.
- Stop!
- I'm trying.
He ain't that crazy.
MEACHAM: Okay, hang on tight.
We're going to
have to do this another way.
(SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE)
(GROWLS)
Elliot! No!
Hey!
Elliot! No!
Jack.
PETE: Stop!
You have to stop!
GAVIN: Jack!
They're not gonna hurt us. Please!
Stop! Elliot, stop!
PETE: Don't hurt them! I need them!
I need them.
(GRUNTING)
Jack, get out of there!
- GRACE: Gavin?
- Break the glass!
(GRUNTING)
Come on, I got ya!
Come on, Elliot!
- Daddy!
- Fly!
(SCREAMING)
(CHUCKLES)
Let's go. Go!
Come on!
(SCREECHING)
(CLATTERING)
Daddy!
No, Grace...
Come on, Elliot.
(NATALIE CRYING)
Come on.
(WINGS FLAPPING)
(SIGHING)
MEACHAM: Grace.
(HELICOPTER HOVERING)
(GROANS)
I know.
I know.
Pete.
Pete! Wait!
(GASPS)
We can't stay here anymore.
People know you're here.
They'll come looking for you.
But I can't disappear.
But I don't want to leave you.
(YELPING)
Honey, look.
MEACHAM: No one ever
saw that dragon again.
And I never told another tale about it.
I didn't have to. Not after that day.
Folks looked high and low,
but it was nowhere to be found.
Some said he flew to another forest
far, far away.
But those were just stories.
Time marched on.
Children got older.
Trees growed taller.
Tales growed taller, too.
By and by, even the best ones
come to an end.
But I know someone
who would tell you otherwise.
There's one little boy
who could tell you the whole story.
He could even tell you
what happens next.
He knows that the North Star
shines brightest of all.
He knows that there's
magic in the woods,
if you know where to look for it.
He knows his dragon is still out there.
Maybe, if you're lucky...
that same boy...
the bravest boy I've ever met...
he could tell you where to find him.
(GROANING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
You had your maps drawn
You had other plans
to hang your hopes on
Every road they led you down
Felt so wrong
So you found another way
You've got a big heart
The way you see the world
It got you this far
You might have some bruises
and a few scars
But you know you're gonna be okay
And even though you're scared
You're stronger than you know
If you're lost out
where the lights are blinding
Caught and all the stars are hiding
That's when something wild
calls you home
Home
If you face the fear
that keeps you frozen
Chase the sky into the ocean
That's when something wild
calls you home
Home
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Calls you home
Calls you home
Calls you home
Calls you home
You're lost out where
the lights are blinding
Caught and all the stars are hiding
That's when something wild
calls you home
If you're lost out where
the lights are blinding
Caught and all the stars are hiding
That's when something wild
calls you home
Home
If you face the fear
that keeps you frozen
Chase the sky into the ocean
That's when something wild
calls you home
Home
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Go North, go North
With wings on your feet
Go North with the wind
Where the three rivers meet
There's a clearing of sorts
In the circle of trees
Where the wild constellations shine
One two and three
Look all around you and see
Deep in the forest there dragons will be
They come from the Earth
Yes, they come from the stone
The icy, cold North
That's where they call home
Go where the mountain kisses the sea
Better be brave
Far braver than me
Look all around you and see
Deep in the forest there dragons will be
If a dragon should find you
You might ought to run
No one has lived through
such a run-in, not one
So if you hear a roar
Goodness sake, leave them be
Up where you find them
Wild and free
Look all around you and see
Deep in the forest there dragons will be
Look all around you
You won't find me
