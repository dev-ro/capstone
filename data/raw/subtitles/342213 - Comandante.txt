[January 1959, Habana, Cuba]
The Opression..
...has ended.
The joy is overwhelming...
But still...
..there is alot to do.
There's a discrepancy,
On a small island...
A big revolution...
No, I would have been dead.
Let me see..
If I go closer...
I have to look my best.
You ought to follow the orders
given out by your superior officers.
Me too...
The Palace
Habana, Cuba
I know it's late,
but you have to sign these.
What?
I can sign a few of them.
Let's do a couple.
I think that would be my speeches.
No, but when I write I try to
establish a harmony between the words.
I try to combine the words, to
ensure a cadence, a rhythm.
I could produce alot more-
-simply by talking in public.
Only the lord knows how many
thousands of stories I've told.
A minimum amount of time for
administrative duties.
As much time as possible with
my fellow comrades, talking-
-about different issues.
Yes, in finding solutions to problems.
You have to gather information
and familiarize with problems...
...in order to find solutions.
I don't waste my time shaving.
This one time I estimated that
I was saving...
... months, if you calculate
15 minutes of shaving per day.
When I was a young man...
...I dedicated alot of time to sports.
I found a great pleasure
trying out many different sports.
Today I do sports occasionally-
-for health reasons.
This office is my track and field.
I count all the steps i take.
Right away.
First, I check my watch...
then my pulse....
And then I start walking.
What am I to do?
I am a prisoner.
This is my cell.
I react calmly to good news-
-even though I rejoice inside.
And for the bad news:
-I'm used to bad news.
-Yes, some news are hard to deal with.
For example when I got the news
that my mother had died.
I felt a very profound pain.
Or when I got the news
of Che Guevara's death...
Ernesto "Che" Guevara (1928-1967)
Leader of the Cuban revolution.
Killed in Bolivia.
There are moments of very deep pain.
It's not only the news, but also
some events that I've witnessed.
That's the first time we claimed
someone to be deported.
Such illegal actions have been
happening for a long time now.
We wanted to win a battle
that didn't concern justice-
-but rather politics.
I felt a special emotion-
-when we received the
father's request-
-to claim for his boy to be
sent back.
I realized from a legal point of view
we would never win the case in court.
But first, I needed to know
who the father was.
To undertake such a battle,
I need to feel I am right.
They tried eight times.
The couple had eight miscarriages.
It was their 8:th try. He Cried.
I felt sorry for him.
I felt right away that it was fair-
-and that we had to do what was
right. And I was not wrong.
Actually it has never
crossed my mind.
-Never crossed your mind?
-Never. No!
Maybe it has something to do
with my confidence.
I have never been asked that question.
Perhaps, it's due to the fact that
already as a small child-
-I had to solve important problems.
I was sent to Santiago, Cuba,
when I was 5 or 6 years old.
That was my first hard experience.
I got used to solving my own
problems.
No, she was my ally.
..when I demanded to be sent to
a boarding school she was my ally.
My father had plenty of land
and my parents used it as farmland.
But I demanded to be sent
back to school.
That was my third battle.
During the second year on
law school-
-I got involved in an expedition-
-to overthrow the regime in
Trujillo, Santo Domingo.
Yes.
-No, but they tried to torture me.
He knew that I didn't have either
money or resources.
They underestimated us.
-No, I don't believe in destiny.
I don't believe in that.
If I shared that feeling...
...it would seem I had
reached the end as a leader.
We have never given up our fight.
Not for one second.
And the day I die,
whatever the reason-
-I wouldn't think it was destiny
that pushed me to that end.
Today I believe in a free Cuba-
-in the future of our ideals.
And maybe that will be the
great test of time.
Yes. I admire Hemingway.
Maybe it was his philosophy?
-I would fight until I got killed.
And if the situation was such-
-that my gun stopped working
or my ammunition ran out-
-My decision would be: Death!
Without a doubt.
I have never been a believer-
-simply because of the methods
they used in school to persuade me-
-about god, they were dogmatic methods.
Yes, I'm totally confident it is.
José Marti 1853-1895
Cuban national hero.
Neither of the two.
I always try to be rational.
I have a vision what relative
glory can be like.
José Marti expressed it
in a phrase:
"All the glory of the world-
-can be confined in a
grain of corn".
I have never thought about glory.
I have never been thinking about
how I want to be remembered.
History is a relative thing.
The human species can be wiped out.
The sun could stop shining.
So what is then being a celebrity,
or being famous worth?
One day, nothing will exist anymore.
If it's not attained relatively soon..
..then the human species will be
obliterated.
We can't continue polluting
the environment-
-continue to exploit our
natural resources-
-and undermine the living
conditions of man.
You don't even have to
resort to mathematics.
Simple arethmics would indicate-
-the present problems must be solved,
or mankind won't survive.
Sometime during this new century-
-common sense will win the war
over greed and ignorance-
-and that man will survive.
But in a very short period of time-
-in 40 or 50 years, there will be
almost 10 billion people.
It will not be worthwile to
live on the planet-
-we have left.
I think that society is
somewhat helpless against drugs.
We have been able to protect
ourselves-
-from the widespread use
of drugs.
We have reduced the drug abuse
to a minimum.
Cuba is a country with one of the
lowest percentage of drug users.
I think that natural drugs will
be replaced by synthetic ones-
-which are cheaper to produce.
A change, rather than a revolution,
is possible -
-since the current order in my
view is unsustainable.
May 1959, Nationalization
of American companies in Cuba
Number 24.. United Fruit Company.
I have been critical, but it would
work better here than in India.
I have mentioned it
as an example of-
-the tendency towards a
homogeneous culture-
-and the destruction of
a cultural identity.
A culture derived from the nation
with power and media control.
Variedades Obispo
Cuban National Store, Habana
1960 - USA introduces an embargo
that still today is enforced.
This story is well known.
[1975 - FN Building]
[New York City, USA]
-that the colony could be freed-
-and the different groups
could be organized.
The Cabinda province is
filled with oil.
That's one of the reasons the
imperialists want the power in Angola.
They organized the FNLA...
...with a little help from CIA.
Some imperialists ask themselves..
...why the Cubans are helping
Angola.
[1975 Fidel Castro sends]
[30 000 men to Angola]
[As an answer to]
[The Apartheid regime's invasion of Angola]
They are used to countries
co-operating just to get oil-
-copper, diamonds
or other natural resources.
No, our interests are not of
any materialistic nature.
It's simply logicial that the
imperialists don't understand that.
Their norms are based on
chauvinism, nationalism och egotism.
We carry out our international duty
when helping the people of Angola.
[The South African army]
[Retreating from Angola 1988]
That one is nice.
We have about 120 paintings.
We did not go to the museum.
Look at this. The work he made.
Porto Carrero.
He painted the town.
This is the swamp..and the main land.
Hardly nothing. I haven't watched
a film for 10 years.
I have been busy all the time.
I haven't had any holiday.
Ever since the collapse of
the social structure-
-our patience has been tested
numerous times-
-the double blockade for instance.
I haven't had any time off.
-I think so, but on video.
Yes, I saw "Titanic".
On video as well.
That one you really have to watch
on the big screen.
It was an interesting film.
Almost like a theatrical play.
-Almost all of them,
but I can't remember anymore.
-I can't remember their names.
-Sophia... The Italian.
-Sophia Loren.
Yes, Sophia Loren.
I remember. She was one them.
I'm also a big fan of
Brigitte Bardot.
Charlie Chaplin.
I can watch his films
over and over again.
The films of Cantinfla I can
also see over and over again.
And I have seen some of
Gérard Depardieu's films.
When he played the chef of Ludvig XIV,
where he had to gain weight.
But he gained too much weight,
and he remained fat.
He is extremely funny.
I have met him a couple of times.
You feel satisfied when you see
the support you're getting.
But it seems to me,
that in the last couple of years-
-after the kidnapping of Elian
Gonzalez we've had mass rallies-
-Far greater than those during
the inital part of the revolution.
-Now people will think I'm a liar.
But I've told the truth.
The question about the feeble and
the strong man hasn't been raised.
I don't read everything that's
written about me in the states,
Maybe I'm answering this
question subjectively.
Normally I'm very self-critical.
Maybe not concerning things I've
done, or all my mistakes...
...but when it comes to things
I've could have done better.
Sometimes we're even ashamed
of the things we've done.
But we have managed to do ten times
more than other countries in Latin America.
[Eva "Evita" Peron - Presidents Wife]
[Argentina, 1945-1952]
We found a country where 30 %
of the population were illiterate-
-and where 60 % had hugh problems
reading and writing.
And I don't think I'm exaggerating-
-if I say that 10% of the population
were educated.
At the time of the victory
of the revolution there were-
-between 30 000 and 40 000
persons with an university degree.
Today there's 700 000.
It's one of the biggest victories
of this revolution-
-that even the prostitutes have
university degrees.
Do you know how many prostitues
there were before the revolution?
100 000.
Now, there is way less.
One becomes aware of-
-things we could have done better,
when you discover the possibillites.
The camera man tells me it's
better you're on this side.
-I don't know. I don't smoke any longer.
-Maybe it's candy?
I usually carry a gun with me,
but I've removed it.
Luckily I don't carry any
secret papers with me.
Maybe more in the past. Back then
I wasn't tied to the office as much.
[Latin American School of Medicine]
[Habana, Cuba]
There has always been doubts,
when you use a scope-
-it's very hard to get back
to the target on the 2:nd shot.
It recoils, and you have to
find the target very quickly.
I have never believed the theory
that it was one man.
If you aim well, all you could
acheive is one good shot.
The possibilites that it was a
conspiracy are very high.
And the strange thing that
the assumed killer was killed...
It's all difficult to believe.
Yes, visit the school.
Walk around.
-Can I leave my bag here?
-Yes, it's safe.
-If you don't have secret papers.
-Where are you from?
-Nicaragua.
-Venezuela.
-Guatemala.
It's free of charge for them.
Dominican-American,
Thanks for letting me study here.
She is Dominican-American.
And during the years prior
to the revolution-
-a great number of women died
in illegal abortions.
And others suffer from the
consequences.
Today it's a mother's choice.
It's not common, because women
of today are better educated.
They want to work, study
and be a part of society.
I think we have spoiled their class
for today so we're going to leave now.
He was a man with good intentions-
-whose country needed improvements,
not destruction. He destroyed it.
[Conference Center, Habana, Cuba]
[Fidel Castro Jr. - Nuclear Physicist]
[Fidel Castro III - Grandson, Student]
[Juan Almeida]
[Revolutionary leader]
-Did they say:
"Castro doesn't know what he's doing"?
Nobody ever complained about Castro.
Some complained about the living
conditions and wondered-
-what was supposed to follow.
We were inspired by independant
Cubans who were brave warriors.
Máximo Gómez, Marti, Maceo,
who organized an invasion...
30 years of machetes and horses.
They inspired us throughout.
The tactics we used was a
product of mere observation-
-and meditation-
-and inspiration.
I met him the first time
in march of 1959.
He was vice president.
We spoke to each other.
I explained to him the Cuban problems
and my idea for the future.
He immediately wrote a draft.
In which he said that
I was a communist.
Just talking about a
land reform back then-
-could get you listed
as a communist.
I would say that from the
very beginning-
-I got the impression that
he was just a hypocrite-
-and just a petty politican.
Conceited.
He recommended an expedition-
-to crush the Cuban revolution.
When we were deprived of the
sugar quota-
-the United States were left
without market of sugar or oil.
It was a economo-political moment.
We had a sentiment of gratitude
towards the Soviet Union-
-but it was not yet a political
commitment, or a military one.
The fact of the matter is that
the expedition was organized...
...in Guatemala, against Cuba
prior to the invasion "Bay of pigs".
So, then we were buying weapons
from the Soviet Union.
Kennedy inherited the invasion plans
from the Eisenhower administration.
Plans that were already in
process of being executed.
Just after two months the
invasion plans were set to work.
Kennedy was an inexperienced
president.
He trusted the institutions
too much.
[Stevenson, US Ambassadeur]
[FN 1961]
[April 1:st 1961]
John F. Kennedy inherits a war.
against Castro's communist regime.
It culminates in the "Bay of pigs",
where CIA-trained exile Cubans-
-try to overthrow Castro.
The 3-day invasion is a hugh failure.
1200 attackers are taken prisoners.
Exile Cubans blame Kennedy for
refusing air support.
The reason for having missils here-
-is that the Soviet Union had
information that -
-there was a plan to invade Cuba.
Even under the invasion he
made very strong statements.
He talked about strategic missiles
and insinuated that Cuba needed support.
And there was a moral issue to
consider as well.
We did not like the idea of
Soviet missiles here.
We had taken all necessary
security actions-
-rather than to have a Soviet
military base situated here.
From a military point of view,
the Russians didn't do a good job-
-They allowed American planes to map
the whole area and to locate the missiles.
They put our country in great danger.
We thought we were going to be obliterated.
That we were the first ones to
be obliterated.
-Socialism or death.
-It might have been interpreted that way.
I didn't say: "Strike first"
I said: "If this country is attacked.."
"If this country with 40 000
Soviet soldiers are attacked.."
I was sure that,
after the bay of pigs...
...that an American attack
would just be a matter of time.
We did not have a Russian interpretor.
We only had a Russian ambassadeur-
-who didn't speak very good Spanish.
I wrote the letter myself.
I doubt that he received a
clear statement.
I can't imagine how the letter
was translated at all.
Then, Chrusjtjov sent a letter where he
defended himself towards the accusations.
He said that he had obtained guarantees
from the United States that-
-Cuba would not be invaded.
An oral agreement of course.
And he said that we had suggested
to strike first.
[Oktober 1962]
The Russian head of state Chrusjtjov
places nuclear missiles-
-on Cuba and builds a Soviet
military base on the western hemisphere.
President Kennedy defends himself
with an embargo-
-and stops all transports
of weapons from Soviet.
Kennedy was emotionally involved.
He believed what Chrusjtjov said.
It became a game of words.
Chrusjtjov used a naive and
superficial statement-
[A. Gromyko]
[Soviet Foreign Minister of affairs]
-based on his intentions
with certain weapons.
He said that they were not intended
for offensive use.
Therefor they were not
offensive weapons.
No, we were simply afraid that
they wouldn't be destroyed...
..and that we would suffer from
the radioactive leakage.
After 13 days, the Russians agreed
to remove the missiles-
-if USA didn't invade Cuba.
That the Guantánamo base
should be returned-
-the removal of the blockade-
-the end of terror attacks...
Five issues altogether.
Yes, that is what they did,
and that's what I wrote about.
They put our interests aside.
A great tension was created
all around the world.
Nobody wanted a nuclear war-
-over an American military base in Cuba,
or an economic blockade against Cuba.
Nobody would have started a nuclear war
over that.
We were inexperienced.
We could not pretend to have more
experience than we had.
We didn't know anything about
the balance of power.
At the time of the invasion,
the revolution was just 2 years old.
By the time of the missile crisis it was
three and a half years old.
It seems to me, we did what we had to do.
And we did it pretty well.
But i don't think we would have
known...
...just how erratic our
allies could be.
They did not understand the 3:rd world
or our operations there.
They just thought about
tank brigades-
-artillery och motorized infantry.
Troups in general.
Irregular warfare cannot be fought
with that kind of troups.
They're only good for parades. We have
dedicated ourselves to irregular warfare-
-and triumphed over
traditional warfare.
It would at least have been an
expected behaviour from the USA.
It was not the only
American intervention.
Santo Domingo and some other places
in Central America were intervened.
CIA existed back then of course.
-Yes, everybody knew this.
Except the Americans.
Yes, all the Americans hear, is that
it's a "communist regime"-
-that's a "danger to the national
security" And that's a sacred phrase.
Whenever that phrase is used,
the effect is merely a reflex.
"US national security..."
That's a sacred phrase.
No, there were Cubans that studied
the experiences of the Vietnamese.
-I don't think more than 20.
I'm not totally sure about this,
but it was a small group of people.
There has later been rumors
that we had security advisors there-
-and that these advisors participated
in torturing prisoners of war.
This is an absolute lie.
If this was true you could be sure
that we would've taken those people to court.
Believe us or not.
I assure you that in 43 years of
revolution
..we have never used torture.
That principal we adopted since the war.
It was Batista's methods, and we would
never use them.
The Vietnamese didn't want
any foreigners in their army.
They never asked the Chinese or
the Russians for help.
-Yes.
Very nationalistic.
The Vietnamese were not criminals.
They didn't execute their prisoners.
-You should know better than I.
You know that there were an invasion.
1500 soldiers. 1200 were taken prisoners.
The battle lasted for 68 hours.
Hundreds were injured, and
more than a hundred died.
We were attacked by planes
disguised as Cuban planes.
That was a source of irritation-
-and a tremendous anger
for the people.
I want you to tell me if any of
1200 prisoners were tortured.
I came there myself.
Ask anyone, ask Almeida.
Go to the streets and ask people if
they've ever heard of anybody being tortured.
It doesn't fit our way of life, and it
doesn't go together with our morals.
[Huber Matos, Major]
[Sentenced to 25 years for treason]
The merits of war were minimal.
The trial took place here.
I went to court with all
the papers, all the evidence-
-and he was sentenced to 25
years in prison.
He performed a treacherous act.
A dangerous act.
[Museum of modern art]
[Habana, Cuba]
If we tell them where we are going
there will be alot of people.
We can tell mr Reagan...
..that we aren't scared
of his threats.
What is a dictator?
Does anybody really know?
Is it bad to be a dictator?
'Cause I have seen American governments-
-Being friends with the biggest
dictators that ever lived.
Karl Marx talks about the dictatorship
within the proletarian movements-
-Not of personal dictatorship.
I have always tried to solve
the basic problems-
-through persuation and
moral authority.
You will not find a single picture
from the last 43 years-
-where the police is oppressing
the people.
What do they mean?
They deny me as a dictator?
I don't see the similarity,
but I do think that Evita Perón-
-struggled for people's rights.
She fought for her ideals-
-and actually got a bigger
support than her husband, Perón.
I'm not offended by the fact that
you compare her to me.
I haven't borrowed ideas. I have always
done what I thought what was right.
I confess to myself being a dictator.
My own personal dictator.
I'm a slave to my people,
that's exactly what I am.
It was his imagination.
Look at him.
What we did today,
we can do in any neighborhood.
In any street of Habana, we can
do the same thing. Walk by ourselves.
In every state there's a
bureaucracy.
I don't like....
We are talking about different things.
I don't give orders,
I convince people.
I talk to much sometimes, but that's
simply because I like convincing people.
I speak in a simple manor.
Almost like a conversation.
I have trouble sitting still.
The pope said recently that
the theory of evolution-
-is not reconsilable-
-with the doctrine of creation.
The pope does not speak
about hell-
-he talks about the fear of god.
I don't believe in everything
that man has created.
It depends.
If religion is used to create
values or to comfort people-
-then, that's not an opiate. But if
it's used to support bad things..
...then it might be an opiate.
Religion comforts many people-
-I feel very pleased with my life..
...and the things I've accomplished.
It gives me pleasure when new ideas
creates succesful solutions.
I'm constantly pleased with
the revolutionary work.
I wouldn't consider to trade
my life with someone else.
Yes, I think that the values that
people have are important.
You should do something worthwile
in life, no just by being a role model.
Yes, everything is based around
giving our people possibillities-
-to develop their full potentials-
-Both in the field of health
and education.
We try to cultivate certain values.
One of the most admirable
things about Fidel is that-
-he's a historic man,
a role model-
-who constantly refers to his
own personal experiences.
But he doesn't live in the past.
He tells us what the future brings.
-People will live forever.
-We can live for 120 år.
Turtles can be 300 years old.
Could we modify the genes
and live longer? It could be better.
Researchers should be working on that.
It could be the source of youth.
If a man could live for 500 years
we would end up being bored.
-So he doesn't want to live forever?
-No.
My mind has adjusted to the thought
that I can't live forever-
-There's a time limit.
-A deadline.
Also to think?
Viagra helps thinking?
The doctors say that it helps
with the blood circulation.
-I could be a CIA agent.
-Correct. Headlines will be:
"Oliver Stone travels to habana
to give Viagra to Castro!"
If they believe in America that you
could kill the enemy with a heart attack.
You'll be decorated
The decoration you didn't get in Vietnam.
That's the courage you need now
to do what you do.
It all depends if it will be
within 20 years...
...within 10 years or 6 months.
Since I always has been in danger
being killed in one of those attempts-
-since the initial revolution, I've
always thought: "Who could have the-
-authority to continue the revolution"
It's not going to be easy.
I have more confidence in the ideas-
-and the political culture
of our people-
-than in the men themselves.
-Who is he talking about?
-About me.
It has been a habit in my mind
that I don't feel it's my right to
talk about any public relation
I had with a lady.
That's the first rule in my life.
[Celia Sanchez died in cancer 1980]
1959: Fidel Castro stars in
Edward R. Murrows "Person to Person"
As a politician and a revolutionaire
I refuse to mix family with politics.
The whole idea behind a "first lady"
to me seems ridiculous.
As for my children, I haven't
had much time for them.
If you're going to measure my parental
quality judging by the time I spent-
-Perhaps I haven't a very good father.
-I haven't had much time.
But I'm fully sensitive to my children-
-and their needs, and I'm very sorry
I don't have more time to share with them.
When I'm with them, I try to make
the most of that time.
That's a wrong question...
..since it's based on the assumption
that we don't have an electorial system-
-and that we don't have elections in Cuba.
Possibly, our elections can often
be more democratic than in other countries.
I think you ought to study the
Cuban election system and our methods.
All the citizens are participating
in shape of delegates from all regions.
The parties don't choose their
candidates, the people do.
The citizens chooses and nominates
their choice of candidates.
You can't assume we don't have
elections here in Cuba.
At the beginning of the revolution
there was in our country-
-a male-chauvinistic spirit...
and prejudice against the
gay community.
That is something that has
faded away during the years-
-Today people practically
are not prejudice anymore.
It was hard because we lived
in a chauvinistic society...
The black population was the poorest.
They are the ones that
benefited the most from the revolution.
Thanks to Fidel,
"I now have what I deserve" as he said it.
It's all thanks to him.
Trust me.
The most revolutionary here are
the blacks.
Yes, we have black political leaders,
but we aren't pleased yet..
We haven't reached the maximum
possibillities for equality between races.
They have entered a phase where
the cease-fire has been lifted-
-and all the negotiations have
been terminated.
It could lead to a very bloody war.
-So he sees another Vietnam?
-I see a civil war coming.
I can't compare it to Vietnam-
-because historic events never repeat
themselves exactly the same way.
It's going to be a complicated war,because
many different forces are involved.
[The South African apartheid regime]
[supposedly had nuclear weapons]
[When Nelson Mandela]
[became president 1994 they were missing]
No. I know a little bit about that.
My deepest conviction is-
-that he doesn't know where
those nuclear weapons are.
I asked him about it. What had
happened with the nuclear weapons-
-and what he had been told about
the weapons.
He said he was told that they
were destroyed-
-dismantled.
That is a question many of us
bare in mind.
It's impossible to establish a
world order based on force.
The solution to the world's problems
is not a military solution.
I hope the American people
will play a defensive role-
-when it comes to defending the idea
of a better world with a more human system.
From a strategic point of view,
I think he was correct.
But I never heard Che only
referring to the United States.
USA is it's people.
To stop the corruption,
and to put an end to the abuse-
-and the opression.
That was what Che prioritized.
It was about the struggle against
colonialism. That's what Che meant.
If history is written like that-
-I wouldn't believe in history again.
Here is a letter from our comrade
Ernesto Guevara.
"Fidel"
I feel that I have lived up
to the duty-
-that tied me to the Cuban
revolution-
-Now I leave you, the comrades
and your people, which also is my people.
The truth is that he asked one thing
when he joined us in Mexico:
When the Cuban revolution had ended
he wanted to continue the fight-
-and he didn't want,
for reasons of state-
-that we should stop him-
-He had his mind set up.
-He wanted to continue fighting.
The Russians became critical.
That they used the capitalistic
categories to build socialism.
-Never.
It would have been like getting
rid of my own brother, Raul.
I sent him to Africa and
I will tell you why.
Che was very impatient,
He wanted to go to South America.
I didn't think the situation
was right at the time-
-and our mission in Africa
wasn't completed.
He was very anxious to fight.
Guerilla warriors have to be young.
Bolivia was cojoint effort.
I realized that it would take time.
When a guerilla war starts,
when you initiate it-
-the terrain and the people
is unknown.
I wanted him to arrive safely.
But then there were different
ideas about how things should be-
-and the head of Bolivia's communist party
got jealous of Che.
Therefor there were antagonism.
"Other countries compete for my
modest contributions"
I leave no possessions for my family,
which I'm proud of.
I don't ask for anything, because I know
they'll be taken care of by the state-
-everything they need to make a living,
and get a good education.
You always philosophize.
I wish we could observe life as
two different parts.
The first part is a rehearsal-
-and the other part is real life.
It has happened to you, me,
to all everybody else.
It's enough being born once.
Of course, everybody make mistakes.
Life is a process where you learn
values and ideas.
We are neither born with ideas,
and not born with values.
We learn along the way.
We are taught along the way.
Or perhaps we learn from our
own experiences.
If I was born again, I think
I would be more or less the same person.
Under the same circumstances of course.
Our Nation - Or Death
We Shall Prevail
Let's not fool ourselves in
believing that-
-the future will be easy.
Maybe it will be even harder.
I have to take him to the airport.
it's the only guarantee, let's go.
Don't waste any time, Oliver.
We don't have any flowers or presents,
but we'll post you some.
-Leave him, and we'll feed him.
-Good, I can do voluntary work.
