I did not annoy you?
Why?
For the imitation.
That flatters me
and makes me feel young person
Let to me look at itself
Of near, you do not resemble to me,
but they are my gestures
I imitated your style,
what makes you single
I am it always
but I changed
I cannot sing the pop one any more
I became
a lady of the song
I know,
but me I like the old one:
Ia wig, the miniskirt,
your spirit, your style
I am unaware of if it makes fun
or if it makes charm
It charms!
I dream!
Crush, Manuel!
With the fact, Letal, here my husband.
Ah, it is that one.
Enchanted
It is what your true name?
Like the song says it.

That depends.
For you, I am a guy

But, I will be naked!
Mom, gives them to him
OK, but gives me

Right, that of the heart.
It is it left
Thank you for the loops, Becky
Thank you for the tit, I have 3 of them!
You help me?
Of course

To help with what?
Handbook, this type is inoffensive!
Rebeca never misses
an occasion to humiliate me
It said to have reasons
to be jealous, not?
You know me.
You did not change!
You either
And I by of delighted
I changed
That is not seen,
but I matured
That pointed out anything to you,

Too many things.

You me insults!
You never were
a conventional woman
I was what like woman?
A marvellous woman

She knows it?
But it makes pretence of nothing
Give the lacquer
Another thing?
Yes, combs
Put them in the bag
You help me

You must be badly with that
To be beautiful,
it is necessary to suffer!
I suffer
without being beautiful for as much!
That annoys you.
what do I imitate women?
Not, I adore
that you imitate my mother.
I would like to be
more than one mother for you
Fine talker!
Ah, which cheater.
These hips.
You help me for bottoms?
Hold.

Why does it delay?
It is unforeseeable
It holds of me.
Ah, the cow!
I dreamed some.
Thank you, it is true
that I needed some.
But that will not reproduce
Why?
Because I love my husband
This monster?
Yes,

Do not lie!
You knew it or you imagined it

I cried
because of its hardness
I took the pills
and I was going to leave.

I started to cry
Me too
Yes, I saw
Listen, there I am pressed,
I cannot speak, but.

I need sleeping pills.

- Yes
One will see.
You worry for Rebeca.
Therefore, I inquired
Useless, mom
I will see his mother
She hiding place something
That, I know it well
Look at that
You recognize it?
It died it
Formerly, he was the lover of the mother
Look at, there.
Who is this?
Dominguez Judge
Enter
Astonished that I live
a basement?
To tell the truth, yes
My parents held the cabin
I was born here
Why return so late?
It is difficult to say
Thank you, pose that there
I missed time
the 1st year
And then 15 years passed.
A little tea?
Mercy. my mother knows
the same type of inertia
It is an artist?
Something like that
She is sorry
for your daughter and your son-in-law
When did you know it?
Who?
Handbook. with your return?
Yes
I was invited to the marriage
but I could not come
You recognize?
That, it is ugly!
Answer me
Yes.
I recognize it
That made a long time.
Handbook was made maintain
by the artists whom it interviewed.
Me included/understood
You lied?
I have the right to forget
You speak
like a culprit
I am not it
You think of your daughter?
I do not think anything
I suffer too much to think
That will astonish you.
I want to help you
To help which?
Not me.
You are free
The prison would not be worse.
And if you want to help Rebeca.
remember that it acknowledged
I do not believe
that she said all
She said some enough!
You could speak to him
She will not lie you
You dream!
You are not anxious
for it?
Of course that if!
Why you do not want
to see?
I do not want nor to speak to him,
nor to reopen my wounds
I could avoid you
bureaucracy.
and of going to the prison
Thank you
But I am afraid of Rebeca
Fear of having to face it
Every morning.
my only desire
is to arrive at the evening
to make
what I can do:
to play.
I cannot make more
Then, only leave me
I would like to keep the cut
I must return it.
Leave!
It is beautiful!
Stopped with me.
It is a whore
It balanced a brick on
a cop to join his girlfriend
It has heart.
Hold, sleeping pills.
You are battered!
Useless to shout it!
I had said to you
not to sell to him! Bitch!
Shit, stops!
I will kill you!
Why
I almost butted this guy?
Just to see you!
It is with which, this wind-breaker?
With me of course
I can see something?
Release me!
They is false,
I offered it to a buddy
- It is with me
- A you?
I leave it to you. where you had it?
On a stiff,
one shared his business
A death? You are sure?
That of which I speak,
it was a indic
Hugo, a indic?
It traficotait, were not friendly for you
this wire of whore?
It was not a son of whore,
close it!
Go, cool
Listen, looks at that
It is him?
Yes
- Sure?
- BOF.
- Then?
- Leaves me
Then what?
My buddy died
I am sorry
It is him?
It said it to you?
I had offered to him
the red wind-breaker
With your place,
I would get information better
One lived together
a few months only
It left without stop,
like all junkies
It was it?
Yes
I tried to help it
Although in love,
I refused that it lies me
One day, I said to him:
"leaves me!"
It never returned
And these photographs?
From this time
When I depress, I photograph
what remains me of him:
Ies photographs. looks at, its cock
A beauty spot
on the nipple?
Do not make this head.
What counts, be the tail.
And she said to me that it was indic
You believe?
Many junkies is it,
you know.
But I remember.
Hugo questioned me much
on the prison
Rebeca Giner,
you present at the entries
Go ahead, Rebeca!
Remove to him the shackles
How is that?
Lends to speaking?
Of what?
De Letal, I must find it
More jokes, Mr. IE Judges!
It informs you
They is false
Who said to you that one had kissed?
There was nobody other
Say to me where it lives
I know anything of it
I saw it with the Rosa Villa
It never gave me
its address
One moment
Go over there,
I have a surprise for you
Close the door
The judge wanted that one speaks
Where do you go?
I extinguish my cigarette
Why you did that?
I did not kill it!
But you acknowledged yourself
To kill would have been legitimates,
but it was impossible
I was avenged
by acknowledging this lie
Why me tortures you?
To have slept with him?
It is that!
Would not be stupid
You were not only
Then?
In Sonata of Autumn,
a pianist has a poor girl
That resembles to us.
The mother comes to see her daughter.
who also plays of the piano
It asks him to play
for it
The girl is obstructed,
but it ends up accepting
and plays nervously
of the Chopin
For the form,
his/her mother congratulates it,
but it cannot be prevented
to give him councils
Nothing is any more humiliating
for the girl
Because his/her mother says to him:
you are null!
How oses you
to play this sublime partition?
You think
what would I support it?
You are too vulgar
to imitate my gestures
Even if you wanted it
you would not even be
my pale lining
Your imitation is not a homage
but an insult!
About what do speak you?
I always imitated you
I always wanted to beat you
Without never succeeding there,
except once!
With Handbook!
- There, one lost, all the 2
- Yes, but it married me, me!
You wanted to prove to me
that you could have it
I knew it,
but it was necessary that you prove it!
Forgive Me, Rebeca
I badly acted
What can I make?
You can listen to me
Of agreement
I weigh you since child.
However,
I tried to be useful.
because I adored you
The day when Alberto died.
Yes.
I heard you discuss
You were wedged,
there remained only one solution
It took calming
and of the tonics
I exchanged the tablets
Yes, a moment
It fell asleep at the wheel
If I had not killed it,
it would have refused you the divorce.
and you nor would not have sung,
neither made films, nor liked
I wanted to return to you free.
You had promised to me
all to divide.
but you did not hold
your promise.
I will never forgive myself it.
Take, Miss
Who it is?
Rebeca, listening
That is there, it returns.
It did not eat
Does that go?
One takes it along to the infirmary?
Let us take it along.
Go, Rebeca.
It is nothing, you are pregnant.
Enclosure? Impossible!
If, the tests prove it.
It will be necessary
to occupy you more you,
to eat more,
not to smoke,
to carry out a healthy life,
without additive.
and without drink
For the remainder,
would be merry, all is well
And now?
Carry out a healthy life
and wait.
Attention.
Rebeca Giner
is requested from the visiting room
I repeat
Rebeca Giner
is waited the visiting room
Then, Rebeca!
It is you whom one calls
in the loudspeaker!
Go!
You are?
A legal agent
I bring your release to you
Certificate of release
Then I am free?
Yes
I do not have a pen
Hold, sign
I do what?
The director signed, prepare
your business. Good luck
Thank you
- Yes?
- It is Dominguez Judge
I have just sounded on your premise,
without success.
The bell frightened me
With the prison,
it was said to me that you are pregnant
No silly things, hein?
Does that look at me, OK?
I go up
Not, not now.
Tomorrow
I go up immediately,
just a moment
Afflicted, one had to excavate
I suspected it
You do not come
to arrange?
I come for Letal.
It spends this evening to the Rosa Villa
Who said it to you?
It telephoned to me at the office
What a chance!
My exit, its show
The fact of being pregnant
Sometimes the things arrive thus
One assied?
Obliged well
Why?
It was its armchair
Here, I can?
Letal wants to see you this evening
Why?
It must want to speak to you
And I imagine that you too
You imagine badly
I do not have anything to say to him
And no matter what he says to me,
that does not interest me
You will go?
Me, if
That interests me to listen to it
And you deny
what it is your indic?
That of aggressiveness!
Without me,
you would rot in prison!
I should have thanked,
perhaps?
I believed that you had released me
because you think me innocent
Sometimes I doubt it
I did not intend it to you to say
I am innocent
Why the tele one?
I was desperate.
I made feel guilty.
That holds for a psychiatrist,
not for me
One can feel guilty
without being it. Include/understand?
Yes, but it is you
that I do not include/understand
Me either
It is reciprocity!
Why have helped me?
Why, if you doubt so much?
Not your innocence
That should be enough
Eh well not
I would like to pose to you
so many questions
But I do not have the right,
even if I am the Judge
We agree
Yes
It is necessary that I leave
Goodbye
M. IE Judges.
You have a cigarette?
Bad to smoke
It is true.
you have fire?
Excuse my.

Goodbye
Mom, I am free
Forgiveness for the scene of yesterday
I would like to see you tomorrow.
to kiss you
and to say you that I love you
I adore you like always.
Your small Rebeca
My child.
If your sorrow is large,
think of me
If you want to cry,
think of me
You see well.

your mouth of child.
who learned how to me to sin
Letal!
I arrive immediately!
Thank you to have come
T oi!
The Judge too?
Yes
You can explain me all that?
I am there for that.
and to ask you in marriage
To marry me with which?
Hugo, Letal, the Judge, who?
With the 3
The police force inquires, but.
I created a character
to untie one of my business
That went, I started again
I created my clean.
advisors.
It is true?
Yes. also true
that you await a child of me
Ah yes?
You did not kiss with Manuel
I could lie you,
me also, I can lie
I know
If the child were not ego,
you would have gone to see your mother, not me
- Gives
- Hold
What sought Letal?
It worked on the assassination
of a transvestite,
but I did not find anything
Finally if, you
The furniture depository of my mother:
my burrow
What a brothel!
You are the 1st person
that I bring here.
Thus say, Rebeca
A blow is drawn
or I put on my beard?
Put on your beard.
With the souk which I have in the head.
Slacken.
Do not insist
I take off my sweater
to put on the beard to me.
You put it in your mother?
Of course
It suspects?
Not, it is insane
and never leaves its room
What a family!
How can you lie
with everyone?
With everyone,
except with you and me
And those which you leashes behind.?
Paula, who fell
in love with one of your "you"
Now, there remains only me
Letal, it was for all
to explain you today
How to believe you?
How to know
what aren't you fatal?
And you, that you are not
homo or junkie?
We do not complicate
life with that
We are imperfect
With this confession,
you could destroy me
I do not want it
Marry me, then!
It is a mania!
It should be solved there,
we trained a family
Letal, does not muddle me more
I am called Eduardo
I should marry me
and I have just learned who you are
Eh yes
This song makes me
to always cry
It is beautiful
Becky del P ramo comes
to be hospitalized urgently,
following an infarction which has occurred.
with the theatre
where it played successfully.
According to Dr. Tavora,
the artist suffers.
of an angina pectoris
that it hid.
Rebeca, finally.
Then?
It is badly, it asked you
Do not speak to him too much
I am the Judge
You sit
Firm
My daughter
Finally you are free!
For lack of evidence
Keep that for you!
But with me,
you owe me the truth
Tell me the truth
I do not want to die
without knowledge
I killed it
You are not the only culprit
Do not say that
Why to have hidden your state?
That would have been blackmail
It is like if
I had killed you too
Do not feel guilty more,
that is enough
Listening.
Tell the Judge to enter
Why?
I must speak to him
It wants.
Forgiveness, one called me
Yes, my Father
Enter, please
Approach, Mr. IE Judges
One has little time
I wanted to say to you
You were right
I killed Manuel
Rebeca showed himself
to protect me
But it was me
I was sure
And how?
With its revolver
But not more details
There is no time
I need a proof
Which proof moreover
do you need?.
I am in rule
with human justice,
there remains to me that of God
Rebeca, calls the Father
Yes, Mom
Do not cry any more, my daughter
It wants to be confessed
It is madness!
It is reasonable
that it is confessed
What do I have to say?
My last confession goes up far
The introduction is
a little long, in fact
I believe that that will be enough
No the confession since when?
I was child
Let us make like when
you were child
Holy Marie.
Conceived without sin
I show myself above all
to have lied
I acknowledged to have killed my son-in-law
and they is false
It is not me
Why lie?
To save my daughter
If your daughter made
a so serious fault.
it is to God to save it,
not with you
I am his mother, God will include/understand
My life was used to him for nothing
My death
he will be used for something
You repens of your lie?
Not
I am glad to have made it
Your intention is good.
but so that God exonerates you,
you owe repentance
I repens of all misfortune
that I caused
Tell me all
Would not be morbid
Not, my daughter.
but the Judge
is not very convinced,
I fear that it does not question me
Good
Let us see
On my arrival, Manuel slept
How could it sleep
after my visit?
Eh if, it slept
My pills were
beside its revolver
The noise of the drawer awoke
I asked him how
it preferred that I commit suicide.
Of a ball or an overdose?
And then?
It said to me that it was card-indexed some
Ah, men!
One started to discuss
Tell me the worst,
what it will ask
The distance when you drew.
on which side
it fell into the bed.
I do not want
to be taken of short
Do not worry you,
I will say all to you
Do not tire yourself
Listening.
I was decided to kill me,
when Manuel put to me with the challenge.
Then, I lost the pedals
and I drew
not on me but on him
It fell.
but I did not see his face,
surprised.
and I turned over it
towards the line
But, in spite of its bad conduct
towards us.
that made me sorrow.
because nobody deserves this end
You must learn how to manage differently
your problems with the men
Yes, Mom
Learn to me
Leave, I go there
- Then?
- Similar
Rebeca
It is necessary that I speak to you
Initially, I must see it
It awaits you
Put the bag in my room
I release the business
I will ask for an availability
But it is solved!
I am implied too much.
This nightmare will not finish any
I do not have an evidence against it.
And it is not the moment
I t'en will give,
evidence, me
Mom,
I brought my business
It is well
One lives together again
And the revolver?
I have it there
Give it
Mom, you are sure
what do you want to do it?
Yes
Not like that
I did it like that
Thank you
Open the windows
I want to see the street
Child,
when one lived together.
I could not deaden me
without hearing your heels....
with far.
losing itself in the corridor,
after having passed to see me
Little imported me the hour.
I waited waked up.
