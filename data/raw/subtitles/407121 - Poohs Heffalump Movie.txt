Huh?
[laughs]
Dear Roo. All excited
to go out already?
You're not
even dressed yet.
Mama, did you
hear that sound?
What sort of sound, dear?
l don't know.
lt was sort of strange.
And kind of neat.
- [Pooh] Oh, the bother...
- Did it sound something like that?
[laughing] No, Mama.
That's a Pooh Bear.
Good morning, Pooh.
What? Oh, well, uh,
good morning, Roo.
l wish it was.
A good morning, that is.
- Why? What happened?
- Many things.
- Many strange things.
- [Piglet] Oh, dear.
l'm sorry, Roo.
l must be going.
Where was l? Oh, bother.
- Oh, d-d-d-dear. Oh!
- [Roo] Good morning, Piglet.
What happened?
Where's everybody going?
To Rabbit's house.
He'll know what to do.
l hope.
Whatever do you
suppose is going on?
l'm gonna go see.
[laughing] Have fun, dear.
Come home when l call.
Yes, Mama.
Pooh! Piglet! Wait for me!
[Piglet shouting]
Hold tight, Piglet.
[Roo] Pooh! Piglet! Tigger!
- lt's a Hundred Acre ''catastrophide''!
- Help!
[Tigger] Open up
in the name of us!
Quick, Rabbit! Help!
[Rabbit] All right.
Uh, what?
- Thank goodness you're all right.
- lt came at me!
- l heard this neat sound.
- [Tigger] Terrible.
- What's this all about?
- lt chilled me to the bone.
- l was asleep.
- Something like...
- ...this.
- One at a time!
[all sigh]
Thank you.
Now, what is going...
Me! Pick me! Me, me, me!
- Tigger?
- There l was,
sleeping,
dreaming Tiggerish dreams.
And suddenly
everything starts shaking.
And there's stuff
falling everywhere.
And then it stops.
And l look around.
And there it wasn't, my most
''favoritest'' family portrait.
[sobbing] lt was clean gone.
Did it look something
like this, Tigger?
[sniffling] Yeah, it was...
Actually, it had
a little less Pooh in it.
l see.
[clears throat]
And, uh, Pooh Bear,
what about you?
Well, whatever it was,
it ate my honey. Oh...
And... Aw!
Well, actually, l ate my honey.
- But it made me do it.
- Humph.
l was asleep in bed, and l heard
this neat trumpety sound, and...
Thank you, Roo. Very good.
[clears throat]
Now, Piglet, tell us
what happened to you.
Actually, l-l-l'd like
very much to forget.
Well, what we have here
is a mystery...
- [gasps] Wow!
- ...of the most mysterious kind.
Hey, everybody.
Look what l found.
lt's a swimming pool.
The sky has finally fallen.
Always knew it would.
Oh, m-m-m-my!
lt looks like a footprint.
That's ''impossibibble.''
A footprint, indeed. Anyone
can see it's only a... a... a...
- [trumpeting]
- [all whimper]
- [trumpeting]
- [all whimper]
Rabbit, what sort of creature
do you suppose
would be attached
to a foot that...
...big?
There's only one thing
it could be.
A Heffalump.

Excuse me.
What's a Heffalump?

d "And wing-a-ma-things"

- Out of its back?
- Of course, Roo. Precisely.
[Tigger] ''Exact-tickally.''
d "Its bottom is up"
{y:i}and its top's really down
d "So its nose is its tail"
{y:i}or the other way 'round
d "Yeah, and it's wide as a river"
{y:i}and tall as a tree

[whimpering]
And they live
right over there.
[Rabbit] Heffalump Hollow.
Oh, oh, d-d-d-d-dear!
l know. l know.
Let's go get them.
Capture a Heffalump?
Ha-ha. lmpossible.
Besides, it's never been done.
[gasps] Then we'd be
the first to do it.
lt'd be fun.
lt'd be an adventure.
lt'd be...
...an ''expotition.''
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Yes. Well, now that l think
of it, it would be a first.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yes.
The first Heffalump expedition
in history.
Oh, splendid idea.
[chuckles]
Glad l thought of it.
Of course, capturing a Heffalump
is a perilous affair.
Meticulous planning
is called for.
But how does one capture
a Heffalump?
How, you ask?
lt's quite simple, really.
Come back with your equipment
and l'll show you how it's done.
- Humph.
- [giggles]
Woo-hoo!
[panting]
[crashing, yelping]
Ohhh!
[straining, clattering]
All right. Let's see
what everyone's brought. [gasps]
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Has anyone brought
anything useful?
l brought some rope.
Rope, yes. My thought exactly.
Thank you, Roo.
You see, a simple piece of rope
if the most effective device
for capturing Heffalumps.
Now, everyone together.
Aim at the barrel
and say in a firm voice,
''ln the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,
l capture you.''
[all] ln the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,
l capture you!
And toss.
Brilliant.
ln the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,
l capture you!
Whoa! l did it! l did it!
l'm gonna capture
a whole bunch of Heffalumps.
Come on, everybody.
Let's go get them.
Just a moment, Roo.
A Heffalump expedition
is fraught with danger.
But we gotta go
catch the Heffalump.
Roo, you just can't argue
with a word like ''fraught.''
- But l really want to go.
- lt's too dangerous, Roo.
You're simply too young.
You could get hurt.
But l...
[Kanga] Roo!
Time to come home!
Roo, dear!
You mean l can't go?
- l'm... l'm sorry, Roo.
- [Kanga] Roo!
[sighs]
Coming, Mom.
Oh, don't be sad, Roo.
l-l-l think you're
very, very lucky.
[Rabbit] All right, everyone,
we'll meet here tomorrow morning
for the grand expedition.
[Kanga] And Rabbit and Tigger are
quite sure Heffalumps are so awful?
And everybody's
gonna catch one but me.
lt isn't fair.
Oh, l'm sorry, Roo,
but there will certainly be
other adventures you can go on.
l'm grown up enough to catch
a Heffalump. Aren't l, Mom?
You're growing up
very fast, indeed, dear.
Faster than you think.
Do you think l could grow up
by tomorrow morning?
[chuckling] So soon? Why?
Then l could go
on the ''expotition.''
You know, dear, growing up
doesn't happen all at once.
lt takes its own time.
But l need to grow up now.
Well, then, how about starting
with a good night's sleep,
little Mister Roo?

Ahhh!
[grunts]
[birds crying]
[bird cries, rustling]
[Tigger] Hoo-hoo-hoo!
[Pooh humming]
Ah!
[Eeyore straining]
[Rabbit] Ah, yes.
A perfect morning
for catching Heffalumps.
lt's very brave of you
to join us, Piglet.
Especially since it's
so very dangerous.
Well, l thought of hiding
under my bed, Pooh Bear,
but l'd rather be hiding
out here with all of you...
...than under my bed,
with all of me!
Now, now. We've gathered
the best minds to the task.
Namely my own.
We simply can't fail.
Right you are, Rabber-rific.
With Tigger's
Heffalump-tracking skills,
it's a fate-a-complicated.
[Rabbit] With courage, cunning,
and superior tactics,
we'll be home by teatime.
Oh, l hope so.
Behold. Heffalump Hollow.
Home of the dreaded Heffalump.
[Piglet] Oh, my. l believe
that what's over there
doesn't look quite as friendly
as what's over here.
Fiddlesticks and nonsense.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
[clears throat, strains]
Hmm.
There you go. See?
Rabbit didn't
get gobbled up.
Yet.
Hmm!
[grumbles]
Okay.
[grunting]
[Tigger] Hoo-hoo-hoo!
[crash, grunting]
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Well, would you look at that.
l didn't get gobbled up either.
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Yet.
- [gulps]
There you are, Piglet.
lt seems that both sides
of the fence
are about the same.
So far.
Ha! Now to teach those
Heffalumps a thing or two.
[clears throat] Ready!
Forward, march!

[Pooh humming]
- Thank you, Pooh Bear.
- You're welcome.
[Rabbit] Now,
remember, everyone,
the important thing is
that we stick together.
- Oh! Uh, coming.
- [Rabbit] Safety in numbers, you know.
You know, if we didn't
stick together,
we would be very lost indeed.
Don't let me hold you up.

- Oh, really?
You can catch me.
l'm a Heffalump.
A Heffalump?
Heffalump. Heffalump.
That's what l am, all right.
A Heffalump.
But you can't be.
Actually, l am.
lf you're a Heffalump...
...then where's your horns
and spiky tail?
l don't know.
Wow, a spiky tail.
l wish l had one.
Are you sure you're a Heffalump?
My mummy says l am.
[blows, laughs]
Well, if you are a Heffalump,
then in the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,
l capture you.
Okay.
Jump.
[gasps]
l did it.

You did it!
You did it!

Um...
- ...Piglet?
- Yes, Pooh?
Why are you setting out
little pink jelly beans?
l've been leaving a trail
so we can find our way back
from the Heffalump ''expotition.''
Oh, bother.
Oh, no.
[echoing] We're lost!
Whoa!
[blows air, laughs]
- Stop!
- Okay.
What game should
we play now?
Rumblejump? Leaplog?
Or Hogswallow?
We can't play any games.
- Why?
- You've gotta come with me.
Yow!
Why?
Because l captured you.
Why?
Because...
Because l'm a grownup.
Wow. You're a grownup?
- Hey!
- A grownup.
You must have
your own call, then.
My call?
Yeah, like this.
[blows air]
Like that. But only better.
Haven't found mine yet.
[hiccups]
My mum said l'll find it
when l grow up.
[blows air]
[hiccups]
l can't wait till l grow up.
Well, growing up
takes a long time.
lt took me just about forever.
[strains]
- [trumpeting]
- [gasps]
That's it.
That's the sound l heard.
Gotta go now. Bye.
Wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave.
But my mummy's calling.
[gasps] That's your mom?
Don't you have to go
when your mum calls?
Well, yeah, but...
Don't go yet.
Let's go see my friends first.
Then you can go.
Well, l don't know.
Please?
Mmm...
Okay, l guess.
[sighs] Thanks.
But soon as we're done,
l've got to go.
Okay.
Forward, bounce!
[laughter]
[laughter]
[Heffalump] l know another game.
lt's called The Name Game.
Heffalumps have names?
Of course.
My name is Heffridge
Trumpeter Bumpet.

Heffridge Trumpler Brompet
Heffalump the Fourth.
Whoa.
How do you remember all that?
l can't, so everybody
calls me Lumpy.

We're planning an ambush.
[Tigger] So, um...
You see any Heffalumps yet?
[Rabbit] l know.
l'll use my famous Heffalump
call to lure one over.
You have an infamous
Heffalump call?
Well, of course.
All great Heffalump catchers do.
[clears throat, cries out]
[Rabbit] Scree!
Yooo!
[howling]
- [growling]
- Ah!
M-M-My, what a dreadful sound.
[gasps] Do you suppose
it might b-b-b-b-be a...
Oh, yes, Piglet.
lt does sound rather Heffalumpish.
Oh, m-m-my!
Do you see it?
- [gurgling cries]
- [Tigger] That one was good.
[gasps] l see a tail.
Are there horns too?
Two of them.
Oh, d-d-d-dear.
Be brave, Piglet.
This is our chance
to save our woods.
[gurgling]
And our honey.
Yes, Pooh.
[struggling]
ln the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,
l capture you!
l caught a Heffalump, Piglet.
And so did you.
Rabbit would be proud of us.
Pooh, have you noticed
that Heffalumps
look a lot like rabbits?
And why do you think that is,
Piglet?
Oh, d-d-dear.
The Heffalump knows my name.

- Scary things live there.
- Huh?
That's where l live. There
aren't any scary things there.
That's where l live. There
aren't any scary things there.
Are too.
There's a stripy thing
that bounces, and it goes...
Whoo!
Then it pounces.
[hisses]
Whoa!
[laughing] No, that's Tigger.
You're wrong about him.
He's great.
And there's this
little pig monster
that squeals and shakes
all the time.
And it will get you
if you don't watch out.
[Roo] Oh, no.
You're wrong about Piglet too.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
And then there's
this loud thing,
and it's got long ears.
And he yells at everybody.
Yeah, you're kind of right
about Rabbit.
But he's okay
once you get to know him.
l don't want to get to know him.
Do l have to?
Hey, you really are scared,
aren't you?
- But my friends aren't scary.
- Uh-huh.
Who told you all this stuff?
l don't know.
Everybody knows.
Hmm. That's just what Rabbit
and Tigger said about Heffalumps.
[gasps]
There's nothing scary here.
Promise?
Promise.
[sniffing]
[straining]
Hmm.
[both] Whoa!
- Roo.
- Sorry. My fault.
[humming]
[grunting]
Why, thank you, Tigger.
All right, no more fun and games.
The Heffalump is all
but in our grasp.
- [trumpeting]
- [all cry out]
- [all] Go away!
- [Pooh] Excuse me.
[Tigger] Are we planning
another ambush?
Of course not. We're hiding.
H-H-How will we know
w-when it's s-safe?
Oh, m-m-my.
[Rabbit] Well, Piglet?
Do you see it?
lt's coming! lt's coming!
l suggest a retreat
to another part of the wood.
[Tigger] l'm right behind you.
This way.
[Rabbit] No, that way.

[Piglet] Oh, hello, Eeyore.
Ah! Goodbye, Eeyore.
l'm afraid to ask.

Pooh Bear?
Hmm. lt looks

Excuse me. Sorry.
ls that you?
Yeah. My mum usually
makes me a snack about now.
Do you have any Rumpledoodles?
- What are those?
- They're like biscuits.
They go rather well with honey.
Wait. That's Pooh's honey.
Mmm.
Oh, well. l guess he won't mind.
[gasps]
Um, we better go
before we break something.
[crashing]
[both] Uh-oh.

This is where Rabbit lives.
ls he the one
with the pointy ears?
Don't worry.
He won't hurt you.
They must still be out
on the ''expotition.''
Lumpy?
- Mmm.
- [chewing]
Ha! Hmm.
Oh, yeah?
[Lumpy laughing]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoa.
Huh? Wh...?
Ah!

Oh!
Whoa!
Gotcha.

Oh, m-m-m-my.
Well, what do you know?

try and breach these defenses.
- lt's impressive, Rabbit.
- Now,
to await the attack.

Oh, no! We forgot your mom.
[trumpeting]
l really have to go.
[trumpeting]
She sounds worried.
Come on.
l'll help you find her.
Thank you, Roo.
Roo!
Roo!
[trumpeting]
[sniffing]
[Roo] Mrs. Heffalump!
[blows air]
[Roo] Mrs. Heffalump?
[blows air]
[blows air]
Mrs. Heffalump!
[blows air]
[blows air]
[Roo gasps] Gosh.
She's not here, either.
Don't worry, Lumpy.
We'll find her.
Um, uh...
Let's try that way.
[blows air]
[whimpering]
Lumpster?
Are you okay?
[sniffs]
We haven't heard my mom
in a really long time.
[softly sobbing]
Um... Do you wanna
play a game?
No, thanks.
Don't feel like games.
[Roo] When l don't feel good,
my mom sings to me.
[Lumpy] My mum sings to me too.
[Roo] d "Little Lumpy Loo"
d "Reaching for the moon"
d "So many things"
"we've got to do" d
l want my mum.
Me too.
Wait.
My mom.
She'll know what to do.
Come on.
Come on, Lumpy.
Let's go back and find her.
Come on, Lumpy. My mom
will make everything okay.
Roo?
Roo!
Roo!
- Oh!
- [clanking]
Oh, my goodness.
False alarm!
As in, ''Never mind!''
We almost casually captivated
ourselves a captive Kanga.
And that's kind of hard to say.
What's all this for?
We built traps
to catch the Heffalump.
Clever, huh?
Please, have any
of you seen Roo?
He should have
been home by now.
Come on, Lumpy.
Just a little further.
Hey, look.
There she is, Lumpy.
[echoing] Mom!
Roo!
This is Lumpy!
He's a Heffalump!
[gasps] A real Heffalump!
- And it's got Roo too!
- Stop him!
- Unhand him!
- We'll save you, Roo!
Wait!
- [panting]
- [mumbling]
- Never mind.
- Retreat!
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Bounce for your life!
- Charge!
- No, wait!
- Lumpy!
- [Kanga] Roo!
Lumpy!
Wait! Don't go!
Lumpy!
Lumpy!
Lumpy!
[all] Roo!
Huh?
[gasps]
[sobbing]
Lumpy?
[sniffs]
You said they
wouldn't be scary.
[sniffs] You promised.
[straining]
[grunting]
Oh, Lumpy. l'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.
l want my mummy.
- [Rabbit] Roo!
- [Kanga] Roo!
Come on, Lumpy.
We gotta get you out of here.
Roo.
Come on.
Let's get you back home.
- There they are!
- [Pooh] The Heffalump's got him.
[Tigger] Drop my bouncing buddy,
you Heffally-rascalump!
[Rabbit] After it!
[all] ln the name
of the Hundred Acre Wood,
- l capture you!
- No! Lumpy!
- We did it!
- We did.
- Leave him alone!
- Wait!
You're scaring him.
Rabbit, what on earth
are you all doing?
Well, we're rescuing Roo
from the Heffalump!
Wait. No, stop.
You don't understand.
What? Now, see here, Roo...
Rabbit, let him finish, please.
We were wrong about Heffalumps.
They're not scary creatures.
Lumpy's my friend.
He's just like us.
- He gets afraid.
- Oh!
- [Roo] He likes honey.
- Oh!
[Roo] And he even learned
how to bounce.
Oh, look at that.
So... So you've
got to un-capture him.
But...
- Oh!
- Lumpy!
Lumpy!
[all shouting]
Oh!
[Kanga] We're coming, dear!
- Oh, dear. Roo?
- Roo!
- Hold on, Roo!
- Roo!
Mom... Mama?
[grunts]
[gasps] Tigger.
[all straining]
[Rabbit] We'll help you!
Just hang on!
Roo, l've got an idea!
[Tigger] One, two, three...
Hold on, Roo!
Pull!
[blows air]
Lumpy?
There, there, Piglet.
l think he's trying to help.
[loud trumpeting]
[gasps]
[giggles]
[trumpeting]
- Mummy!
- Mummy?
[loud trumpeting]
[Lumpy] My mummy's coming!
[loud trumpeting]
[loud trumpeting]
Heffridge Trumpler Brompet
Heffalump the Fourth,
where have you been?
Oh, my little darling.
l've been worried sick.
l'm okay, Mummy,
but my friend Roo's in trouble.
Can't you save him?
[whimpering]
- Mummy, this way. Hurry.
- [Rabbit] Oh, my.
Roo, can you hear me, love?
Now, don't be frightened.
l'm Lumpy's mummy.
Here l am! Right here!
- Don't you worry, love.
- Oh!
Just leave it to me.
[creaking]
- Ohhh!
- Oh!
Now, now, try not to move, love.
Here l come.
Hold very still, love.
Easy does it.
Yeah!
[trumpets]
Oh, thank goodness.
- Mama! Mama!
- Roo! Oh, Roo.
l was so worried.
Thanks, Mrs. Heffalump.
Mummy!
You did it! You did it!
My little Roo.
Oh, Lumpy.
You've found your call.
Oh, Rabbit.
That's why the Heffalump
was in our wood.
She was looking for her baby.
[clears throat]
Young...
...Heffalump.
l...
That is to say, we...
[sighs] Can you ever forgive us?
We've acted very badly.
That's okay, Long Ears.
l like this kid already.
You're right, Rooty-toot. He is
nice, once you get to know him.
Lumpy, darling.
We really should be going.
l have to go home now.
Goodbye, Lumpster.
Goodbye, Rooty-toot.
- Just a bit longer?
- Please?
Well...
l don't see why not.
l suppose a few more minutes
wouldn't hurt.
- Forward, bounce!
- Wow!
Here l come!
Roo, Roo, Rooty-toot-toot.
Woo-hoo!
Yippee!
[laughter]
