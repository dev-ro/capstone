What if your house would be?
And the power is out, and
there is no light anymore.
And the kids are jumping in
the hall, and she screams ...
Mama, Daddy, come quick, I'm afraid.

Welcome to the Natural History Museum.
Where history comes to life.
Step up and ask your question.
I am for.
Well. Where are you born?
Here in New York, Twenty Street.
October 27, in the year of the Lord 1858.
History. Learn.
America changed. One child at a time.
So you add some interactive
pieces to it.
No, Mr. Daley, not add.
We replaced the old pieces.
Where do those go?
-Way.
All that shit.
Diorama, the figures of wax, even this.
This ugly little monkey.
Careful. He is a marrowfat.
--It is a monkey.
This is a rare breed. A marrowfat.
Not just a monkey.
Why not just 'monkey say?
We throw away a monkey, then
you have no name needed.
You can throw it away, or move him?
Who are you?
Do you waste police?
Let it go.
Who idea was this?
--From me of course. I have the leadership.
I and senior management.
Mainly the supervisor.
What do you care now?
People love this stuff.
People, Hr. Daley, of
what comes after.
Hear that you know.
You are left.
My situation changed.
My business was less.
Yes, that I had also done as
I nachtwakerwas been.
Where are they going?
Deep hidden away. Federal archives.
Where is that?
--Washington DC.
Smithsonean.
We need something to do.
--It is already decided.
They go away tomorrow morning.
It is over.
How are you?
How you?
Do you have what you hear?
I got something for you?
Are you stronger than me?
Is that all you can?
Lawrence, nice to see you.
Yes, nice to see you, Teddy.
-- The guard from Brooklyn is back.
Hey, Oc. Feet told me
what was going on, I did not know.
Is true, there is Lawrence
changed much since your last visit here.
One could say ...
Cricket.
Hey, concierge.
We need some help.
Hey, guys.
How are you.
Look who it is.
The great man himself. Just in time
for us to wave.
Yes, Jed, I heard it.
I do not even know how it could happen.
Yes, a real mystery.
That happened.
Maybe the answer
that thing buzzing in your hand.
You were not here, so it is done
That is no mystery.
The fact is, there was nobody here
after closing time, we could talk.
Guys, it's good.
Tomorrow I call the supervisor. I have
some influence. I normally do.
It is good.
-- 'We' did you hear that?
There is no 'we' have more, since
you us' painome island 'have put.
And that is a very cold place.
Larry, what has been done,
that is done.
Even the glory of Rome
to its end.
Would you please not dramatically
in the distance watching as you say.
Then I feel even worse.
-- I know not what you talk.
What are you looking at? I'm here.
That piece of wall.
Guys, maybe it is not so bad.
Yes, you have a point. But we have
about Smithsonean.
I know you. Dexter.
You do not understand, Gigantor.
They make us go.
Larry, I know you want us
to brighten ...
I can see that you a
little touches.
But it will never
same ...
We are all together in this place.
--It will never be our home.
Jedediah, please ...
Lawrence, they are emotional times
for us all.
But it is the last night,
as a family.
And I would not think this is wasted
self--pity.
So, who is with me, for a final
walk through the sacred halls?
Are we going with them?
--No.
Then I turn myself in pity.
Shall we?
Safe journey, dear.
Do you need some help, Dexter?
Come on, no hatred, right?
It is not good.
It is almost morning, Lawrence.
Yes, so where is your coffin, Teddy?
I ga not traveling, Lawrence.
It appears that, Rexy, a pair of
the other pieces here.
Tentative.
Without the table?
Frankly, Lawrence ...
Ahkmenrah's table, remains here.
Together with him.
What?
--They go without the tablet.
And I am afraid that this evening
will be their last.
You do not say?
Sometimes it is better to be a little white lie
tell the painful truth.
Is everything good with you?
-- I do my best.
And who knows ...
sometimes takes a larger change
a greater chance.
See you again. You are here avoided, and
have built a nice life.
Yes, I think so.
That is more than. I think so.
You are an influential businessman.
The world lies at your feet.
It seems to me that you all have
what you wanted.
Yes, I know.
No, you do not know.
If I may, let me than you
a little advice.
The key to happiness ...
to true happiness is ...
I have Japanese deal.
No, I switch it off.
Excuse me.
The key to happiness?
Goodbye, Teddy.
So they are gone? Was there nothing
you could do?
I wish it could.
I have tried everything ...
I have talked with Mc Fee,
and the administration.
But they have obtained this morning.
-- That's a lot of food, Dad.
Yes, Ed comes along.
I thought I had told you that.
We have some things through.
So you work tonight?
I worked every night, remember?
That was the best job because you
the world had.
Nice, I can your 'Guitar God 6'
or how that is, not pay.
Gigantor, I, Jedediah.
Jed, how can you use the phone?
Long story. The monkey has
table stolen.
And now ...
--What is wrong?
Kamunrah.
The brother of Akhmenrah, he is here.
And not very friendly.
I repeat, not very friendly.
-- Is that Atilla, Jed.
Jed is everything with you?
Hey, Jed.
What was that about?
I do not know.
Come on, I'll put you to your mother.
What's wrong, Daddy?
-- That we go out.
If he says that archive Smithsonean
, where exactly should I go?
That is exactly, Dad.
The Smithsonean is distributed over 19 museums.
They are divided on the Mail.
From the Capitol to
the Lincoln Memorial.
Since they have of everything.
They have cool stuff.
Nicky, focus.
In what museum is the archive?
Not in, but below it. It is
throughout the Smithsonean go.
If there Akhmenrah table below is ...
The largest museum in
world comes to life.
What about your plan is exactly, Dad.
-- Don 't worry about.
You have no plan, eh?
--Yes, I have a very good plan.
You have no plan.
-- That's right. I'll call you when I am inside.
Welcome to the great museum
in the world.
Yes, I know that it is great.
What you say of that plane,
which hangs from the ceiling? Beautiful or not?
Sorry, can you tell me
how come in the archives.
Yes, you need only
a historian to be ...
I'm kidding.
He seems the type does not.
Excuse me, the archive is in the basement
and this is a secure section.
Really? Properly secured so.
Thank you.
The gate of Kamunrah.
Kamunrah.
What?
--What are you doing?
Do not touch.
-- I would not touch.
This is an ITT.
ITT?
--Not to touch.
No, I do not want it ...
--You wanted to touch it.
Sorry.
-- Get it on.
I stand there and wait the whole day ...
so that a girl like you come and
her painted nails scratching the pieces.
The last time I checked
I lived in a free country.
No. --No?
No, this is America not touch.
I like it here but look at it?
Look what happens when you touch it.
--You threatening me, Brandon?
It is Borondin. -- Sorry.
-- Borondin.
Brondin?
-- Borondin.
Borondin. There were no 'o's' more
when they were your name?
I do not know? Were there
no jokes, more jokes in the shop?
It looks like Borondin.
-- I no speech therapist, it's Brondin.
Borondin, good.
--Have you never heard that name?
Borondin? No.
-- Look beyond the babynamen top ten of 1984.
Borondin.
-- Well, would you threaten me, Borondin?
I do not know, it is?
Jeez, 9 volt. Great device, right?
So hot.
Personally, I prefer the LED Maglite
but I'm it.
Do me a favor.
--What?
Put your hands in your pockets,
come a piece down ...
and be always polite to the people.
Great. But may I ask you something?
--Yes.
That there are no misunderstandings,
this should not me. Is that correct?
That is really crazy.
Have you decided your life used to terminate
as expected? I turn the flashlight.
Now me threatening me.
-- Do not touch me.
I get the whole day.
-- I get all day with my flashlight.
The flashlight for light to shine.
-- I will literally a camper hire ...
and we drove through America
with my flashlight against your chest to.
Do not.
--What should I not do?
Once you see what does not,
if I do.
Brandon Seriously, you've ...
-- Borondin.
Borondin, you have no idea of
who I am.
You do not know what that word means.
I have seen things that you
can not propose. --What things?
I ga 't tell ...
unless you drop the flashlight.
But like you said, sounded as if
it could be something great.
Yes, you will not hear
if you do not drop the torch.
Everything good?
That was really what you just did.
-- Thanks.
All forgiven?
Excuse me.
--No, excuse me.
No, it was my fault.
I am touched.
Two opposite forces,
created by this friction.
You just do your job.
Take it easy.
This guy is great.
Okay friend, I am inside.
--Very good. Where are you?
In the north east corner of the castle
opposite the park.
Say how I come to the archive.
Well. At the end of the corridor,
ga you right ...
and to the left, you get a swing.
I got it.
--It is a maze down there.
The corridors connecting multiple buildings.
It can be complicated.
Then we hurry, we have
but still 28 minutes until sunrise.
If you are in zone B,
ga you again to the left.
Nick, hello?
Papa,
--Nick, you ...
Identification.
Approved.
Until soon, friend.
Yes, okay.
--Yes.
Okay, where are you, boys?
Oh, thank God.
You difficulties maker,
I covered with you later on.
Do you speak French?
English maybe?
Excuse me, who are you?
-- I'm Kahmunrah.
The great king of the great kings.
And from the darkest depths
of the history ...
I came back to life.
Maybe you have not listened.
I am a century old
Egyptian Pharaohs. I was dead.
But now I am back to life.
Yes, I have heard, and that
I understand.
Welcome back.
Who are you?
Larry Daley of Daley Devices.
Something in New York. It is funny
I know your brother.
Akhmenrah. -- Is that so?
--Yes.
He knows my baby brother.
The favorite son.
Yes, a good child.
-- That is certain.
Mother and Father gave him always the best
everything. And I mean everything.
They gave him the throne.
Lawfully mine was!
Since he never had ...
I like to believe that. Now begins
the year of Kahmunrah.
Since I am back to life ...
Never mind, give me the table.
Give not to him, Gigantor.
Remain quiet in there
please.
Let me not to come.
-- That would not be wise!
Look, the table is stronger ...
than you Larry Daley of Daley Devices
could propose ...
things back to life
to obtain, is only one part of the truck ...
I will be the gateway to the underworld
open ...
and I bring my army here
from the land of the dead.
So, if it is not too much trouble ...
Give it here.
Well, you go.
Wise decision.
Yes, I am sorry, I thought
the cube that you wanted.
The cube?
The Cube of Rubik.
Well. What is the cube of Rubik.
Just a cube, the cube that
all opponents to dust let perish.
I thought ...
My bad though ...
your brother wanted nothing to do with
have, he also wanted to play safe ...
you seemed to me as a lame duck, so ...
I am not my brother, Larry.
I will you and your friend
in an instant murder.
Take me to the cube of Rubik again.
There it is. Open it.
Come straight to my table back
I got your friends.
Take the engine.
--What?
I said, take the engine.
I love it!
Keep her right, I do the rest.
Now, attack!
What is the plan?
--We are Americans ...
we have no plan, we act.
Hold.
See that? Always act
then think.
That works every time, you are
in good hands.
General, George, J, Custer
the seventh cavalier.
At your service.
All good. Nothing.
Go on.
Where do you go so fast?
Lady, can you go on the side?
Who call you lady?
My name is Amelia.
Amelia Earhart, maybe you do
I heard?
That famous pilot, or something?
Pilot? I was the first woman on
the Atlantic Ocean is flown.
The first in the 'Flying Cross' was?
The first in a Gyrocopter
all 48 states flew.
Maybe a little less
frown.
Would you kindly want to be me
to tell exactly where I am?
In the museum. Actually it.
I'm a little dangerous
situation, so ...
you will probably want
not even in my neighborhood.
You're fast.
--What 's you, flyboy?
My name is Larry Daley.
Well, Larry Daley, in case
you have not heard ...
I ga danger from the road.
And spears? Ga spears you can not

Come on, skipper.
Now we can create some fun.
98.99, bingo.
If a golden fleece.
Okay, troops.
The enemies have captured me
and thus become my enemies.
A big mistake.
Well, this is the plan.
The third horn emits
I will announce 'attacks'!
And at that point, we all
from this box jump.
And attacks.
Surprise Effect.
What do you say?
You Chacachie zabaka.
So hot I do not.
--Say yes to me.
No.
-- 'Chacadimaia?
I know you're a famous General.
It is, I am an ordinary
people like you.
But, if you attack screaming, warns
that the enemy not that we are going to attack?
Yes, I think so too.
You seem to be very popular Mr. Daley
why not just go by?
I can not run away, my friends
down there, and I must help.
I have another way
down found.
This is new.
It is good, I want you hurt.
I do not think they fear for you
are Hr. Daley.
Barter? Thank you.
Ga back.
I will beat you.
How do you this?
I've never had a boy,
a girls work done.
I have two years to a strain in Micronesia
lived and hunted with a spear.
This Micro Eers had slower reflexes.
Come on!
This is a fun party.
Sorry.
Here, and that in 1945.
Hello.
Dad, finally.
I have the exact drawings of the archive.
If you go off the stairs ...
--We are already on the stairs, Nicky.
So you have all found?
Thus about.
Where are you from talking to?
Who is that?
-- This is Amelia Earhart.
You have Amelia Earhart found?
--Hey wait!
What a rush. Have you not heard?
The war is over.
Sorry, those guys are chasing me.
--What?
What I look after, to the history?
Which unit you Saturday?

What? Are you really?
Guys, they want my custom suits

Thank you ...
Understood.
Sir, you forget you ...
What is this thing?
Sorry, I can.
Have you yourself, Mr. Daley?
Call me.
-- Thanks for this.
You're a smooth Janus, or not, Mr. Daley.
Fast.
That worked.
--What's next?
Listen, I'm the middle somewhere, which
not your fight.
Because I am a woman, or not?
No, because I dead old
pharaoh guy behind me to have ...
and I want to murder, in order to tafelt
so that he can rule the world.
But because I am a woman.
You should listen, I is not now
in that monochrome painting.
What?
Black--white photo, you blockhead.
Listen, I can help you.
I want to help you, and not because
I you can ...
so far I do not, but because
I smell adventure.
And damn, I want to do.
Okay, but if something happens to you,
give me not to blame.
What do I lucky.
I am Kahmunrah.
I'm half God.
2nd grade, my mother's side.
Ruler of Egypt.
The future ruler of ...
everything else.
I have lost men.
So I need some new generals.
For me to help these
world to conquer.
Ivan the terrible.
Napoleon Bonaparte.
And the young Al Capone.
The most feared leaders
from throughout history.
Gentlemen.
It's great for you all
to meet.
Same.
I just want you to me faith, and
that I offer you the world.
Literally. Are there any questions?
I got one.
Why you wearing a dress?
It is not a dress. It is a tunic.
This mode was, 3000 years ago.
I assure you.
Are there any more questions?
--Yes.
That dress that you will, we must
there is a bear?
No, of course not.
Have you not heard?
Did you hear me, I just told Mr.. Capone,
that it is a tunic.
A very big difference.
Are there other questions?
Questions that do not have the dress go.
Tunic.
Well, the moonlight is wasted
and time is short.
Short, why are you looking at me
if you recently said.
Sorry, that slipped out.
If we talk about world domination
I am of course interested
But first let me clarify things
so you know what you get.
People always say
Ivan the Terrible ...
he is so awful, I'm so scared
for him, he is so bad.
While in fact correct
translation ...
Ivan the Great.
Ivan the Great?
That really jumps out.
But I was not terrible, in fact
I was a very productive leader.
I did this close encounter
by your questions.
Do you guys with me?
Yes, of course.
-- Good.
Then Larry Daley of Daley Devices ...
and the golden table, back to me.
We bring you back to
your friends Mr., Daley.
You should not lost as
Amelia Earhart follows you.
Quick hide.
I find it fine, like me
hold Mr. Daley.
I am sorry, I did not want to ...
Your legs are not mine
deter since we met.
I have no word to mean.
I hear that now, or
music in the air?
Angels, shut up.
These are Cupid's, Mr.. Daley
Gods of love.
Gods of love.
Shut up, we hide us.
Yes, as a woman.
Not subject to change.
It is not the theme.
We hide us.
And so is that little mouse ...
in the clutches of the big cat.
You are quite busy with size, or not?
This is not the amount.
--You say that I am a little mouse ...
and a large cat
-- I'm the big cat.
No offense intended, but
You are Napoleon ...
There is a building named after you.
You are famous because you're small.
Naïve American boy.
We do not soon do something together
so it's not even an issue.
It is not heights
but it is a plan ...
a brilliant plan
-- So there is a plan.
Good tactic, Emperor.
If your friend just
with my life.
I'm her boyfriend.
I'm her boyfriend.
--No.
Just friends.
Yes, friends.
Acquaintances, good friends.
Were you friends at school ...
and you are afraid your relationship
to destroy ...
when the other says it is more than
friendship, you really like each other can?
Again, I do not understand.
Did you have a relationship as friends ...
and you are afraid your relationship
to ruin by ...
against the other to say that
you want to be more than friends, ..
you guys are like that.
No.
I love secret love affairs
that is all French so,
Yes, love.
This way, if you die.
Yes.
--Let 's go.
Wait, I go with you.
--No.
Fighting is nothing for you
My hair is as tender
accepted in Europe.
It is a guarantee for gold
and paper money.
For the home I have a lok.
Listen, this rodeo clown can not
pancake of a cow pies distinguished
And that boy out there
risking his life for us now ...
The only thing we can do
is help. What great help.
But we can not do
as we are stuck. Either?
We must escape.
What is the plan?
-- It's like a cookie or a Scone.
Breast up?
Ready?
-- Ready.
What are you doing?
Walk quickly, I love them.
-- I will not go away with you.
There is no time for drama,
ga now!
Jedediah Oh, will you go.
These are no real rubies.
Ruby colored slippers
with diamonds.
But, whoever you are ...
Archie Bunker, you had a whole
comfortable throne.
Boss that we caught.
When he wanted to escape from the hole.
One of his little friends escaped.
They are no greater than
a small grain cous cous.
Or are you not?
-- Two words come to me, as you talk.
Delusions, and strange.
And third, I would say,
just stupid.
Let the old Jedediah out,
otherwise he is angry.
Well played, Jedediah.
I take you seriously.
It is so adorable.
Even if you threaten me, it's hilarious.
Is it just me, but
you are so incredibly cute.
Wait, you have the right
for me to keep ...
to torture me, but call me
lovely. I'm not cute.
Relax, my friend.
Stay alive ...
I will find you.
Gigantor, no.
Hello, concierge.
Nice to see you again.
If you do not mind, I take that on.
Thank you.
Finally, after 3,000 years ...
My evil army of the dead.
My beautiful, beautiful, army ...
is released.
I am afraid that mother and father,
what have changed the combination.
I think that the whole underworld release
done, not so good for you turns out.
That must be frustrating because you have
thousands of years to wait ...
and you come back to life,
and everything.
And you will not open.
Do not be afraid. I will have 1000 years
wait if necessary.
Good, because in a few hours you will
are in a frustrated position ...
frozen, and I walk with my friends
than outwards, and that was it.
So, I have the whole night.
-- Really? The whole night?
Well, he has not.
Put the cage open.
--What do you ...
Touch me not.
Abuse me.
Look, he has a small drift attack.
Jad? Non--squeak.
that is not worth it.
Put him down.
--You do not have to be afraid.
I will not hurt you.
I lied.
I do not think the whole night
has Mr. Daley.
As it looks, I think ...
approximately one hour.
Get me out!
You, the night watchman.
You know everything about this table.
Probably you are smarter ...
if you like.
Maybe you know the combination
maybe not ...
but I give you exactly one hour. If you
that fails, I make your friends die.
And please do not escape,
because I love you in the eye.
I do not even know
how I should decipher?
Really.
--What a shame now.
Your little cowboy friend, it seems
as a small charming guy.
Well, Tik Tak, Mr. Daley.
Your hour has begun.
You can do it, partner.
I know you can.
Ga.
He does.
There you are. I made my
already terrible worry.
I'm okay.
Okay, what is the next step, partner.
I do not know. I
this translation table.
Great.
This guy again.
I do not want any trouble okay?
Look at that. These are fish
not like the water.
Actually, it is easy
during handling.
I am glad that you are happy.
Hello can you help?
Teddy.
--Yes.
Maybe you can help us.
-- Sure, but this first.
Those itching my nose makes me crazy.
I ask not happy, but I
miss a couple body parts ...
Can you please just crabs?
Yes, of course.
Delicious. Another piece that way.
Great.
That was delicious.
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.
The 26th President of the United States,
Volunteer of the Cavalry.
Founder of the National park,
and a lot of other things.
Have we already know?
No, that is another Teddy.
We have one in New York.
Really? --Yes.
--How is he, the other I?
Approximately the same.
Except ...
-- Besides, what? Say it.
With a body?
--Yes, he has a body.
That hurts.
-- And a horse.
Sorry, we have so much translate
of what is written in this table ...
can you read hieroglyphics?
--Yes, lady.
That is easy.
Vogel, man with spear, fallen fish
beetle vase.
And what does that mean?
It means, this is just
a rough translation ...
a man with a spear, catch a bird and
a fallen fish in a vase.
And there is a beetle.
I do not think so.
--It is only one possible translation.
If you are the secret of the heart
from the tomb of Pharaoh discovered.
Well, what does that mean?
No idea, I am the Sphinx? Why
ask not for your own Teddy?
I think his greedy hands
on that thing would impose.
Probably, the horse
also still to lick.
Mr. Daley, we should to the statues.
I think that there is someone who knows.
The guy we want,
found here.
Good evening.
--Hello, young lady.
Sorry, can we please continue?
That we can, but this
is a rare occasion.
I mean, it was a Degas, Mr. Daley.
There is a small size into
an hourglass ...
tomorrow should I go to the Wal--Mart
meeting, I would be grateful ...
This way.
I think he
have an idea about it.
Mr. The Thinker, sorry that your concentration
disturb ...
but we have really the secret of the heart
from the tomb of Pharaoh to see it.
I think ...
I think.
--It does not happen to him.
You take me at least in the leg?
Look at that once.
Buddy, here.
This is serious.
Apparently it is a matter
of life and death.
I tell you, what a
matter of life and death ...
the beautiful women there.
Baby, look what I own affairs.
Firepower.
He is certainly no Einstein.
Biceps.
Hold on. From him I
a few seen.
What?
Little Einstein's. --Where?
There. The aviation department.
We must go.
What?
--Nothing.
Why stare at you than to me?
I would not have missed.
-- Well, we have to go because we ...
Why?
--You talk too much.
I do not know why I did, Mr.. Daley.
It feels like I have slept long,
and suddenly ...
I am awake.
-- I know why ...
But I would really ...
Again! Why?
Great. You guys are back.
Well. Great.
The love song from "Titanic."
Good, but not really appropriate.
You state you do not really enjoy
in life when, either, Mr.. Daley?
It is not really the choice
of the song.
Besides, you sing a little false.
I think your great, you see
there is beautiful.
Can you please fly away?
Our adventure goes on.
What did I tell you?
Enough.
I feel like ...
as a floating butterfly.
You are crazier, as a
iguana.
Mr. Egypt, they have heard that we are on the
from world domination, and want to participate.
I do not know who they are.
But here they are apparently
also exhibited.
I did not even know what they are.
Sorry, but we are already full
with bad business today.
Sorry.
-- Come on.
I'm bad. I can show you
how bad I am.
Be afraid of me.
Excuse me, I step in there. You see
not really bad. A little ...
a bit moody.
What are you doing? What is that?
What is this? What does that mean?
I do not understand anymore.
Take your breath now.
I can not hear myself think.
May I propose you something?
Simplify it.
It happens here too.
You're bad, you are automatically
you're a robot ...
And why the cape?
We go to the opera?
I think not.
-- Sorry.
Goodbye.
--Attention.
He is off to that table.
Where?
He tries not to find the combination,
he tries to escape.
Ga, everybody.
Kill him.
Bring the table to me.
Come on, people, hurry,
without the table, we have nothing.
Forces, ga!
You thought to escape me,
or not, Larry Daley.
We are in trouble
-- The problem, really?
If I talk now.
-- That sound you even old--fashioned.
No, the road is obstructed by poor people,
but what is nice to now.
The problem is that we do not
in the aviation department to come.
You're right, we are in the sores.
Come on.
They say that good men
this union.
I have promised to help get
for Jedediah ...
and I will help bring.
This is ...
Who's there?
Jupiter, protect me.
Be very quiet.
They perceive any movement.
I was only talking to myself.
I am not a nut.
Here we are equally secure.
How long have you guarded antiques?
What? I do not work ...
I borrowed.
I was a guard ...
there is New York. but
that is a while ago.
Why are you gone?
If you do not like?
No, I loved it. But things
just went another direction.
What are you doing now?
I design a type of project.
And selling them.
--You are an inventor?
I'm an inventor.
I find things.
If a spaceship?
--No. -- The submarine?
No, not a plane.
Smaller, more
as a 'glow in the dark' flashlight ...
that was one of mine.
So this new job, like that right?
--Yes, very good indeed. It is exciting.
What?
-- I am a little confused, nothing more.
If you are not enthusiastic about
why do you do it?
I am excited about it, I said ...
-- I know what you said, Mr. Daley ...
but what I see before me is
a man who has lost his enthusiasm.
I'm not lost my enthusiasm.
I still have my enthusiasm.
You know why I am become a pilot?
--No, I do not know.
For fun it is.
Why would I do something else?
Oh.
What is it with pigeons and all
their poop.
More look, how the
my union is made.
Stop, sir.
I can not let go.
If you go away, then that many
people convulsions in the body hunting.
Scare? I guarantee you
I am not a freak.
I did not mean that you are a freak.
Come here, baby.
If someone is a freak, you
you, sir.
It is true that you are very small.
I mean for a normal
average man.
What, why would you say something?
Because I honestly sense.
--yes, of course, honest Abe.
Of course. Excuse me.
Great.
Come on, Mr. President. Turn that
man down and go back to your throne.
You are very polite. I will do
what you ask. -- Thank you
It is this belief in the infinite
possibilities ...
They are coming!
We would be very grateful
if you could just keep quiet!
What?
Abraham, freezing!
-- Freezing?
Freezing?
I ...
Thank you.
-- Sure.
Come on, let's go to air and space.
If I can be free?
You two are a single couple.
No, we are not ...
We are not, and ...
I never lie!
The truth is,
you two are like any couple.
Thank you
Goodbye and good wife
small, tiny man.
See if that Einstein
can find.
A huge area.
DC is Arlon Space,
we're back in the job.
The pilots Taskiki go again
a time to their plane.
Can you stop telling all
what we do? It ruined the moment.
The pilots Taskiki life
at the moment.
I would like to thank you.
What--or, master?
Many people thought of us
that we could fly.
Thanks for sharing the moment.
Who is the first in Paris?
-- Bet.
Not now.
-- Around the pond then?
We gotta go.
Not enough time, remember?
Sorry, it's in the blood.
There she is, Mr. Daley.
Bessy, the old family bus. This am
I crossed over the Atlantic Ocean.
I think the Einstein
here on this side.
Mission control, you can launch.
-- Go. --Where are you?
No, we can not launch.
We were not okay to go.
Do not go.
No, do not go!
Attention, start allowed.
We have permission to start.
Ten, nine, eight, seven ...
We will not launch! I repeat:
We will not launch!
We do not go, we do not fly.
We sit in a flying stage.
We are in the stage not to fly.
we say good night. Over and out.
That was disappointing.
-- Come on, I treat you to coffee.
Hey, space monkey?
Able! Okay, how are you?
Okay, so good.
Ok.
You're a nice kid, or not?
Do you perhaps have any idea where
bald figures are that Einstein?
Mr. Daley. I found your Einstein.
Gentlemen, we try the combination
this table to discover ...
according to the inscription we find the secret
in the heart of the tomb of the pharaoh.
That is easy.
The answer is already in demand.
--What does that mean?
Decipher.
It is a figure.
So a number. And the tomb
of the Pharaohs, is a pyramid.
Do not you, boy? Your search for the
secret number, in the heart of the pyramid.
This means that the answer is PI.
PI?
-- 3.14159265 to be exact.
3.14159265?
No, 3.14159265.
Yes okay, 3.14 ...
I see it, you nod, yes or no?
But you can only ...
Not to her.
Sorry, I see no difference.
I am a wobble head doll,
that is the way that we love!
All together.
You can not all be Einstein,
so ...
Me too,
-- Okay.
Okay, the slightly slower?
Ok!
3.14159465.
Well, 3.14 ... -- I get it.
Thank you, Mr.. Einstein. -- Thank you
If the brilliant and famous General
I am ...
I thought about what you said. And now
I have a new and improved attack plan.
I will loudly announce that we
not to attack ...
and then, now it is.
What the great Caster now say,
I hope he is my friend.
Then we fall!
You did not have thought that you
friend so would run away, either?
He comes back.
As sure as the moon shines
the monkeys. He will come.
I would save my breath but if I were you.
Because you have not much more!
We have 10 minutes to
Jed to come.
I think we have a good team,
perhaps even more than one team.
Wait.
What is it? If you
not nice to kiss me?
No. I thought that was it.
Only the store hurt.
Do you not like me then?
--Of course, you are great.
I think your great, there are only
certain things that keep us from ...
You are not ...
--What am I not, Mr. Daley?
Okay, you're made of ...
-- Made of what?
Great things are made of,
great things.
He is there.
Gentlemen, make sure that
we get an advantage.
We will agree to do.
We have them.
No, this is the first ever made is ...
of balsam and paper.
It is made of fabric, and good
American ingenuity.
Ga you have it, or what about it?
Ga on the side!
-- Really.
They escape.
Hang on, Mr. Daley. It is on
the point should be interesting.
Mrs fly on the plane?
Think again guys.
It is good!
What is it?
One of the wires is fixed, I will loose
should take over the joystick.
No, I ...
-- I know that you have enthusiasm possession.
With enthusiasm, you can not just aircraft
driving, since you have a license is required.
Go ahead!
I want that joystick not.
Who would have thought that a plane
was driving.
Able, open the doors!
Gotcha!
Up.
Amelia Earhart, God be with you.
-- God be with you.
You look a little nervous out
Roman Noodle.
For me this is a visit to
a spa ...
Give you the courage already?
Not yet no. Let us look
or you can make time fly.
What is that strange noise?
Stop!
To this, Mr. Daley.
If you do not know how we have come in?
--It is time to strengthen into disrepute.
For your little friend here, hope
I you have the combination.
Give me Jed, No, first you give me
the combination, and the table ...
I will give you the table
as the combination to ...
Once you my friend released
and gives me,
I let go, what I want to let go.
At the moment, if I want to let go.
Well, I just let loose,
if I want to let go.
Give me the combination, and the table now
immediately, or I kill all your friends.
Then I start it with stiff man
fear hare here.
I am not a mule.
I assume this guy did!
Do not worry,
I have this under control.
You want my friends to give back?
Then you get your table together and not.
Well, I is not nothing Kamunrah
reliable mentioned.
But the bloodthirsty Kamunrah that everyone
kill, as they Kamunrah not give ...
what he wants, when
he wants. And that is!
I would also like the combination,
and the table now!
If you call them?
-- The Egyptian is the shorter.
I give you the combination,
after ...
If you touch it again,
then I kill you immediately.
That is not to touch.
-- Good.
I can not believe you still
So issues.
I can not believe.
I would now like to murder.
If you did not know the combination ...
than you were already dead.
Incredibly dead!
But I know the combination did.
Do not pass this line!
With your hand.
If you start talking ...
If you now dare to speak ...
Then I kill you.
You understand that?
Say nothing now.
I kill you if you start talking.
And give me that table and
combination.
Ok. After you give me Jed and
my friends free.
You've done all!
You spoke to me and reached your hand out?
I can here the whole night with you
to talk about it.
And what if I kill you now.
What I really want them to be.
And I have exactly 5 seconds to give me
that table and the combination to give?
We have the combination al
It is PI.
3.14159265.
Sorry.
This mad head here.
He has sung ...
he has sung,
as a canary!
Excuse me Larry.
-- Enough. Remember what happened last.
That's it.
-- Stupid man.
Are you okay?
--Yes, thank you.
That must be a real setback
for you, eh Larry?
Knowing that all your heroic efforts
ultimately not have been.
You must now extremely
feel disappointed.
Do you hear that humming sound mende?
You know what that sound means?
It is a rhetorical question.
That is the sound of the end!
Sorry, Jed.
--You have done your best, Gigantor.
Damn, we almost had him!
I meant that I regret that I
recent years have been in the museum.
Then it was probably
not happened.
You do not either, Gigantor?
I can not call because we need your help
, as we are a bit modest ...
the first time that I myself
help out of trouble.
I called you, because you us
needed.
This beautiful costume, which you that
last years was ...
That was an empty suit,
completely dead inside.
If you're not.
And then there is something.
The night is not over ...
this little cowboy has night
some advantages over ...
and I believe you too. Hurry now.
Welcome, little new edition
the ruler of Kamunrah.
The fifth king of Egypt.
And now, war!
My warriors, come forward.
Send Mr. Daley and his friends,
to damnation.
Halt!
The mighty Octavius has returned!
I row on the back of his world
essentially dangerous.
I drive the squirrel!
Now my challenge woolly friend.
Quiet!
Enter your honorable about?
Or will it finish
with the shedding of your blood?
This is your rescue?
No, this is it.
What should it?
My name is Abraham Lincoln and you,
sir, have now a problem.
Attack!
I hate pigeons.
Greetings, bird heads!
Wait, no.
Bye foreign
bird heads.
Do not return to the underworld!
Yes I go back to the underworld,
Thank you and good night.
This is odd.
It seems that my work is done.
Remember this guy. A house divided,
can not continue.
Goodbye!
--What now?
I'm not sure.
I would say, first, we again
how he dies.
Kill him dead!
What now?
We do not attack, okay?
--No!
Grab them.
Not afraid of Larry, I help Jedediah.
You picked them from behind.
What are you doing? --Hide!
We need you.
I am a failure.
Then you will not.
Bring you really 208 Americans to their death
at the Battle of Little Big Horn?
No.
--No, not at all good.
It is not good.
Of course, one day ...
the truth is, I earn
those stars not.
And I will always remain famous,
my biggest failure.
Just let the past rest.
Now. This moment. This night.
As you will be remembered.
This is your last performance.
They needed a leader.
--Yes, they need a leader.
Will you be that leader?
Yes.
-- Let's go.
Okay Okay.
Guys, this is not the
moment ...
Dexter, you know better.
Good? That's as you do.
Stop! And listen.
You are both proud Capucijners.
You have your focus,
at stopping the enemy.
Keep it together.
Jedediah, you have it.
-- I ga not save.
I fear that the cowboy, the
last dismounted from his horse is.
Octavius, think of me as I was.
Wild and free and ...
You have your last words
yet to say.
I'm still not ready.
The story, about our relationship, the evolution
from enemies to friends.
No!
--You brought me to tears.
You will stay alive!
Let us work.
Grab a sword.
Sword!
It is!
You save!
--You fooled!
You save!
--You fooled! 'Wunderbar'
How you doing, guys?
Are you okay?
-- Better than ever.
Listen. If I know what
open the gates.
I think you have a plan?
-- I send them home.
The table. Now!
Well, you may have. Tell me
who the boss is, then I give you.
Or give him first Kamunrah,
who is your master.
No, he is not my master.
--Well, if he does otherwise.
But tell me then who the boss is
then you can get.
That's me.
This man is a scourge.
I am the only noble birth.
Yes, but he has more medals
and a larger hat.
You may have many medals, but as
you touch the table again ...
is that the last thing that ever
have touched.
Do not touch that little man on.
Hey. I can do to!
You could do nothing to
you can hardly talk, you idiot!
No problem. You can get one.
You see this?
Very clever! For now it is time to fight.
Stand still.
I can not take the honor,
it was the idea of Abraham Lincoln.
You know, a split house
is not so good.
Yes, you did you bring in security,
when you had the chance.
You do me great pleasure.
Murder might help you,
What are you anyway?
I am the night watchman.
I would say that someone
his master has found.
The Battle of the Smithsonian.
The biggest battle that the world
has ever known.
We know that.
Still an hour until sunrise.
You have to.
Have you forgotten?
They want us there anymore.
Well, I do.
Can you give us a ride?
-- Fully my pleasure.
Thank you. Just something to finish.
Come on, boy!
Jump in!
Good.
You are welcome. See you later at sunrise.
These are indeed promising days.
Come on, guys!
Stay with the group.
Now you're back
where you belong.
Yes, excellent.
But I had to go.
Hey, Amelia.
What I tried to tell you earlier.
It is not easy
so to say.
But tomorrow morning ...
I know what is to come, Mr. Daley.
I've always known.
But it does not matter.
You have given me the adventure
a lifetime in one night.
And I have the feeling that
is a beautiful sunrise.
Have some fun.
Thank you.
I do not know what you think, but
cowboy who has at least kissed.
That is it. And where?
-- Canada.
They fly to Canada.
No, it has adjusted the rate.
Down, boys.
Ok!
Brave boy!
Lawrence, thank them
back here.
I would say, well done.
And may I say that they are not
forever in the basement to hide?
Yes, no. That was solved.
The sun comes up.
Your friend is right.
The day to break.
Hey, Teddy! Remember
Got something to say, the key to happiness?
Is that so?
--Yes, what the key and ...
Then came the sun, and
You froze.
I got that out, do what you like,
with people you love.
Actually I wanted to say, physical exercises.
But love sounds good.
Lawrence!
Welcome home son.
Thank you.
Well, folks. The wait is over.
After two months of renovation ...
tonight is the National Historical Museum
reopened to the public.
As you can see,
the interest is overwhelming.
Everyone is curious
to the new attractions.
The extended opening hours until
in the night ...
Is the museum vivid
than ever before.
The uniform still fits after all these years.
As long as ago--is not.
Where we have this triumphant
Return to thank?
Not good enough for business?
Fired?
No, actually I sold my business.
Guilt works in mysterious ways.
One day, we all ...
The next day, a rich
anonymous benefactor ...
with a large sum of money.
And the condition that all
remains as it was.
Well, not everything seems the same.
--No.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am
Theodore Roosevelt.
Nature Research and the 26th
President of the United States.
Come here boy, the game begins.
Hey you 'Dum Dum, bring your
Me "Gum Gum"?
My parents gave me this golden table
3000 years ago given ...
me and one of the most valuable possessions
people entrusted to me.
Is that something?
-- Something to do?
Yes, what is going on, if nothing does.
Actually, the magical powers
and report all instances to life.
Really? What can say?
No, it is just for show.
I told you.
Stupid animal.
That does not look real.
These computer animations.
There is no bag to.
Mammoth, extinct?
This current technology, unbelievable.
--It is real life.
Just great.
Would you like some longer, or you ga
turn off if the worse?
I'll stay here.
--Right, forever?
Well.
If you watchman ...
--What?
The best ...
What say you?
You there, do not touch small.
I wanted you do not stare, but you seem
much like a woman I know.
I hear that often.
--Yes?
Yes, I think I have a face.
--Yes.
You are not accidental family
of Amelia Earhart?
No.
--No.
No, I do not think so.
I mean, I do not know.
I just had to ask.
Excuse me.
It was still the woman, who
Pacific is flown?
The first one flew over the Atlantic Ocean
is. And if the first was the Flying Cross.
That is great.
--Yes, great.
You should certainly see the thumbnails.
Can you show me where that is?
I always lost.
Yes, please.
Come on.
