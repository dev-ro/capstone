[Bell Rings]
This is the most amazing
resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really
good schools. The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right
after another.
And you've also been
with the Lucky Erin
Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh. Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast
in sign language.
You've been
all over the map.
I've got
a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have
a lot of energy
and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change
the world around here.
Just trying to help
a few deaf kids
get along a little better,
that's all.
Everything else
is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh...
am I making
myself clear?
Yes, I believe
that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and...
my signing is rusty,
so how many of you
can read lips?
No one? O.K.
Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony,
good lip readers.
Would you mind
closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me
one good reason
why we should learn to
speak. Tony.
To pick up
hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right. Now...
here.
You.
O.K. Here are two
beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys
want to pick them up.
What is the first thing
you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good. Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good. Tony.
Let's go somewhere
and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere
and do it-t.
I would rather
do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands
are occupied.
For example,
some guy owes you money.
He comes by,
How will you tell him
to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money,
you bum.
Call me names,
will you?
I don't have to stand here
and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet
and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots...
and your lousy food
and shove them...
Doesn't mince words,
does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure. O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're
out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs,
Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math
and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds. Hi.
Did I hear
Miss Ochs say
you were
one of her students?
Yes. I started here
at 5.
Really? Wow, that's
great. I'm impressed.
For still
being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain
in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin,
I've got an idea.
How about the kids making
potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do? Oh.
We do? Oh.
Sarah came here
at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our
brightest students.
Would you give me
some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.
[Classical Music Plays]
Ooh.
Yeah.
Mr. Bach.
Hear that...
cat?
Ooh.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
Again. Faster.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
One more time,
faster.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
Great. Right.
That is great.
Brilliant.
My Lydia.
Come here, Lydia.
O.K. Put your hands
on the speaker. Come on.
[Music Plays]
Feel that?
Good.
Feel it.

A drip.
[Very Loud]
Oh! What a drip!
No. No. No! No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted
to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like
to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you
look at me, please?
If you don't
look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me
that you've been here
since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading
my lips?
I don't think that
you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me,
wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why? I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me
getting out of here
so you can
mop the floor?
Man...
you know,
if you let me,
I bet I could teach you
how to speak.
And you could teach me...
but I don't want
to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't
want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding
is damn costly.
No. I'm talking
about Sarah Norman.
Right. Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever
tried speaking?
Sarah's not
hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's
lousing up the fields.
It's a shame
that a bright woman
is stuck here
cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot,
not everyone
wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had
a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed
as retarded
until she was 7.
We let her know
how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost
$2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell Rings]
That's good.
You have to work
on S's, though.
O.K.? Go. Out.
James, Sarah has agreed
to give you an hour.
She's really
looking forward to it.
You're really looking
forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim...
as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh...
yeah. I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that,
but you go right ahead.
Listen...
how would you like
to fake out Franklin,
make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh...
if...
I...
don't...
sign... faster...
the hour will be over
before I finish
my opening speech.
No. I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd
think I was a scream.
You're deaf? Well, I'll
try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we
get this thing started here?
Well, thank you
for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great. Go.
Glen, who's your
favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name
of the rock group.
Oh. Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me
one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
Yeah. Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your
favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell Rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play
stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful,
you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman
we all know and love.
If my jokes
are terrible
and my signing
is boring,
what are you
doing here?
There's a whole
empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call
your mother.
Hey. Hold it.
Wait. Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just...
why don't we...
why don't we...
go out and have
some dinner tonight?
Huh? Just give me
a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you
behind, uh...
the girls' dormitory,
8:00.
I will whisper
your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign
I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you
give me a break?
My Italian is worse
than my signing.
The veal piccata
is very good.
Look. I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see,
by the time I finish,
they may be out of it.
It's veal. It's, uh...
sauteed in lemon
and butter.
What's veal?
Uh... God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink
this evening?
You want something
to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine
is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah. It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe,
please.
He doesn't think
you're stupid.
He thinks
you're deaf.
No. Only stupid
hearing people
think that deaf
people are stupid.
Do you really like
being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah. I mean,
there are other jobs
where a person can
work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl
cleaner?
You should have told me
that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell,
you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
through your nose!

to hear myself talk.
Hmm?

I am a really good
teacher, though.
You...
You should let me
help you.
What is that?
Lydia does not
talk like that.
Don't you want to be able to
get along in the world?
No one
wants my help?
That's your opinion.
That's fine.
You don't do anything
you can't do well?

It's...
my pleasure.
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again...
because I would've
hung up again.
It's 60 miles
here and back.
Please,
just five minutes.
I just got home
from work.
This is my time
to relax.
Discussing Sarah
is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well. Uh... let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah
in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want
to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate
very well.
Did you ever learn
to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick
of you people
coming here
every few years
asking the same
questions,
blaming me.
God. No one's
blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all
my fault.
Fine. I don't
give a damn anymore.
I really just came
to ask one question.
What happened when
Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped
trying to talk.
She's very pretty,
you know.
Her sister Ruth had
a bunch of boys hanging around,
and they started
asking Sarah out
when she came home
on weekends.
It was wonderful
for her.
The boys really
liked her.
They treated her
just like they treated Ruth...
with respect.
If you didn't know
there was a problem,
you would've thought
she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No. Don't go.
I wanted to talk
to you, anyway.
No. I want to hel...
work with you.
I understand
that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah! Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back
of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at
all the best schools.
Why did you stop
going home?
Did your sister's
friends,
those boys that you
were going out with,
did they have anything
to do with it?
Yes. I talked
to your mother.
Please, let me
help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you
the joys of sex
with a hearing man?
I think that's
one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough
communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
[Stamps Floor]
Hey!
Who is they? 
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered
to learn my language.
I was always expected
to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always
something I could do
as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first,
I let them have me
because they wanted to.
Before long,
the boys were lined up
on a waiting list
my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went
to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out
for a Coke first.
That's not what
I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was
such a big deal...
coming on to the deaf girl,
giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time,
you were laughing at me.
I was thinking,
"poor little deaf virgin
who spread her legs
for every..."
You think that I'm
threatened by that?
You think that I give
a good goddamn
that you fucked every
pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please
listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry. I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah...
you are the most
mysterious, beautiful,
angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling...
into the pool
with you!
God! What a fellow
has to go through.
§ My love will get ya §
§ Like a boomerang, baby §
§ Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang §

How are
things going, Jim?
Great. Just great.
Good. Good.
Glad to hear it.
We've got to have you
to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's
my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks
for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy
to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh...
your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it. 
Relax. 
[Tango Music Plays]
Daphne. 
Hmm? 
You're
leading again. 
Sorry. 
I got a funny
sensation in my toes... 
like someone was barbecuing
them over a slow flame. 
Let's throw another log
on the fire. 
[Tango Music Plays]
Ole! 
[Jim]
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.
You are...
the...
nicest person...
I've...
ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person
you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing
that I ever heard.
You thought after
what you told me...
that you'd
never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love,
but...
she broke my heart.
Oh. Yeah, I know.
Please don't
break my heart.
Did anyone
ever break yours?
You don't hurt
from other people?
You never hurt
from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know
people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted
that you hurt.
I'd...
shrivel up and...
I'll take care
of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean,
that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me
an asshole, say it.
No. Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass...
hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good. It was
still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know
that waves strike
the average beach
about 750,000 times
a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just
made it up.
You do?
What do waves
sound like?
Whoo.
That is
what they sound like.
How did you
get to be so brilliant
and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most
stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn? O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah,
that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't
do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better,
Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated
the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen
is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed
that idiotic haircut?
No. I like to give
the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit For Brains!
Look at
those shingles.
Guess they'll all
have to be replaced.
