The House That Dripped Blood
TO LET
FILM STAR DISAPPEARS
- Sergeant Martin?
- Yes.
- Detective Inspector Holloway.
- Oh! Good afternoon Sir.
It's quite an honour to have you come
all this way down from Scotland Yard.
You think so?
I've got more important things
on my plate.
...than chasing temperamental
film stars.
- Would you like a cup of tea Sir?
- I haven't come here for tea either.
- I sent my report in as quickly as I could Sir
- Yes, I know. I read it!
You must realise Sir this things
not really in my line.
Your report makes that very clear.
Well, there is something I didn't
mention in my report Sir.
- About Paul Henderson?
- No. About the house.
This is not the first time that something
has happened to the tenants of that house.
- Other disappearances?
- No, not exactly disappearances Sir.
Well, what then?
Well, I have a file here,
you ought to have a look at.
There's something that happened about
two years ago Sir.
The house was empty for some time...
Then the Estate Agent had an enquiry
from a young couple in London.
"Hillier", the name was,
Charles and Alice Hillier.
- Good Morning Mrs Hillier.
- Good Morning Mr Stoker.
Good Morning.
- Good Morning.
- Glad you could make it.
Thankyou.
- Well, shall we go in?
- Why not?
Who was your last tennant?
Queen Victoria?
No, but the house has
been empty for some time.
- Perhaps you'd like to see the kitchen.
- I hope there's a refrigerator.
Oh yes! Not the most modern of course
but definitely a refrigerator.
The House of Death
I realise the house isn't modern Mrs Hillier.
But it does have some virtues,
don't you think?
I can't say I've seen them Mr Stoker.
This collection is fantastic.
Somebody who lived here had literary tastes
after my own heart.
- It's perfect isn't it?
- Your'e not serious?...
- No, I mean it. It's ideal for me.
- Oh darling.
Now look. I promise we'll move back to London
as soon as I finish the book.
I haven't been able to write a line in weeks,
you know that.
- Do you really want us to take it?
- Hmm.
I suppose I could bear it for a month or two.
Good. I know I'll be able to work here.
- What sort of work, may I ask?
- My Husbands a writer Mr Stoker.
- Oh, what sort of writing does he do?
- Horror stories.
He specializes in murder. In the most
gruesome ways imaginable.
- Hello darling, your'e back early.
- It's past eight.
- So it is! I must have worked right through.
- So I see.
- Can I read it?
- No.
- Let me show you.
- Show me?
Here. They say one pictures better
than a thousand words.
That's Dominic.
He's the villain in my story.
He's a strangler who's escaped from an asylum
for the criminally insane.
He roams the countryside at night,
searching for fresh victims.
Laughing maniacly as he kills them.
Sometimes I wonder where you get your ideas.
Looking through the window.
That's where I first saw him, this morning.
- Just after you left.
- You saw him?
Only in my minds eye.
From now on Dominic's my partner in crime.
- He's going to make us a lot of money.
- Well, here's to Dominic.
Darling have you seen the car keys?
Yes there.
- How's it going?
- Splendidly.
- I'm almost halfway through.
- Oh good.
You can thank my strangler for that. Dominic.
You know, he's really taking over.
I've come to know his mind.
Almost the way he feels.
That's what makes him so very...
real.
And so very frightning.
Hello, darling.
- What's wrong?
- I.. I.. I d.. didn't k.. know...
- I didn't know it was you, I...
- Who else did you think it was?
You silly.
Oh I'm exhausted. I'll make some coffee.
Do you want some?
Darling, what's the matter?
It's Dominic. I saw him.
- You mean you imagined him?
- No, I mean, I...
...I saw him, last night, just
before you came back from the theatre.
And again, just now.
- But he's just a character
- I know.
I know, but I saw him.
Darling you've been working
much too hard.
Your imaginations playing tricks with you.
Look. Why don't you take the day off
and come up to London with me?
No, no not till I've finished my book.
Charles?
What is it?
- It's Dominic. He's in there!
- Oh, Charles!
No, no, please!
He's over there.
He's sitting in the chair.
There's nobody here.
Didn't you see him move?
He's over there.
Didn't you hear that,
"he laughed"?
Oh darling, please.
- Toast darling?
- No thankyou.
- Charles, you really must see a doctor.
- But I've got a deadline, I can't.
- When the books finished...
- No, NOW!
How much longer do you think
we can go on like this?
Alright.
So that's the story Doctor.
What do you think?
What I think doesn't matter.
It's what you think that's important.
What more can I tell you?
A good deal Mr Hillier.
- I don't understand.
- Exactly.
The point of psychiatry is
to help you to understand.
And, that takes time.
I should like to see you regularly.
At least, once a week.
Perhaps you'd have a word with my receptionist?
And make an appointment.
You do think that you can help me?
I'll Try.
- How's it going?
- It isn't...
- I think there's a storm brewing!
- A storm!
Andrews keeps talking about a storm,
inside me.
Everything comes from the inside
apparently.
A projection of my own imagination.
Do you know what he actually told me,
at our last session?
He said that when an author
creates a character...
...It's like an actor
playing a role...
And sometimes the role takes over.
- I shan't do any more work tonight.
- You just relax darling.
I'll make you a nice hot drink.
- Better?
- Yes, thankyou darling.
Don't touch me!
Keep away from me!
- I saw him, it was Dominic.
- It wasn't Dominic.
It was you.
- Me?
- Yes.
You came up behind me.
And tried to strangle me.
Oh my God!
Oh, Charles!
Darling, what are we going to do?
I'm going to call Dr Andrews.
He must see you.
Tonight.
As I've told you before,
Charles,
An authors characters are an extension
of his own personality.
Sometimes, a part of it that he normally
tries to conceal from himself.
Please, try to relax.
Close your eyes.
Listen to me.
You think of yourself as a kind
and decent man.
You love your wife but, you also
have, hostility toward her.
Instead of,
expressing that hostility
You create a character,
to express it for you.
But that character is only a
creature of your imagination.
It is not real.
As I have said before, your'e like an actor
who loses himself in his role.
Youv'e lived with this character
day after day.
You visualized his appearance,
dramatized his acts.
Though his thoughts.
So much so that youv'e come
to believe, that he really exists.
But he doesn't.
But I've been writing about
murderers for years.
And I've never wanted
to become one.
I mean, why should I suddenly
want to do so now?
Even in my subconscious.
Well! How did it go?
Everything's taken care of.
Darling, I knew the plan would work?
Now we can go away together.
They said that I wasn't
a very good actor...
We don't have to worry
about getting work.
We'll have plenty of money now with
all the royalties on Charles books.
...That I wasn't believeable
in the parts I played.
Hello?
Could I speak to Mrs Hillier please.?
Yes, speaking.
This is Detective Inspector Chapman
from Scotland Yard, Madam.
I'm calling from Dr Andrews office.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
We've found your husband dead.
Doctor Andrews is murdered too.
Hello Mrs Hillier.
Hello?
Hello?
The Police say they've found
Dr Andrews body.
And that Charles has been
strangled as well.
That's right.
Both of them are quite dead.
Andrews first.
And then Charles.
- But...
- It was very easy.
- Much easier than I'd imagined.
- But that wasn't the plan!
The point was t.. to prove charles insane.
It's better this way.
Much better.
But don't you see?
They'll be looking for a killer.
Perhaps they'll come looking
for you Richard.
Richard? I don't know anyone
called Richard.
My name is Dominic.
We found him standing
over her body, laughing.
It's not all him, you know.
It's that house.
- The house?
- Yes, theres something strange about it.
Listen sergeant I'm interested
in facts not fantasies.
Very well Sir.
Consider this:
When that house was empty again the
estate agent rented it out to a new tennant.
A retired Stock-Broker
from the city.
A Mr Philip Grayson.
- Interesting house.
- Yes it is. For the right person.
- Your'e retired aren't you?
- Yes.
- Businessman?
- Yes.
Oh. I see!
- Wife?
- I beg your pardon?
- Are you married?
- No I've never been married.
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean to pry.
I was just thinking you might get
rather bored living all alone in this house.
I'm used to being alone. As a matter of fact
I'm looking forward to living here.
And doing some of the things I had
little time to do when I was working.
Gardening, reading,
listening to music.
Oh no. I shan't be bored.
JAQUELINES MUSEUM
OF HORROR
She is beautiful, isn't she?
My Salome.
- Ah, yes, yes it's very well done.
- Perhaps she reminds you of someone.
You see, she has a strange
effect on people.
They seem to see in her
all sorts of things.
- Was she, modelled from life?
- You might say that.
- Who was the model?
- My wife.
- She must be a.. a very beautiful woman.
- She's dead. Murdered.
No doubt you've seen the rest
of the figures in my exhibition.
They're all murderers. That's
what the public wants to see.
But you said your... the model you used
for Salome was a victim.
A victim, yes.
And also a murderess
I found her one day
holding an axe.
And nearby the body of
my dearest friend.
It was the State that murdered her.
I made a waxen image
of her body her face.
I wanted to preserve her
beauty... forever.
And now men come and stare
at her the way you did.
You will come again won't you?
Even though you know.
No, no, I don't think I shall.
Thankyou. Goodbye.
- My dear Phillip.
- Neville!
- Friends?
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Aren't you going to invite me in?
- Forgive me. Come on in.
- I was so surprised to see you.
- So this is where you've been hiding yourself.
I never thought I'd see you
in this part of the world.
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Thankyou.
- Scotch?
- Lovely.
I was travelling North
on business.
Then I remembered you had a place
about a mile from the road.
So I thought I'd drop
in and surprise you.
To tell you the truth I was
getting a bit lonely.
Will you stay to dinner?
Overnight if you wish.. I've..?
.. I've got lots of room.
You sound as though you'd be afraid
to be left here on your own.
That's past now.
And with me. We could never have
won her Phillip. Either of us
Were not winners,
You and I.
Anyway. It was a
long time ago.
Now she's dead.
How do you manage to occupy
yourself here all day?
Oh, I have plenty to do.
I read, listen to music,
do the garden.
And I walk into town occasionally,
when the weather is nice.
That reminds me... I must pop in myself
and get some tobacco before I leave.
- Can I give you a lift in?
- Well, I wasn't going in but, well why not?
Rather a good antique shop here.
- I used to collect those when I was a kid.
- Did you?
Would you like that swan as
a souvenir of your vist?
I wouldn't know what to do with it.
Unless you filled it with apple strudle.
I must say things are very much cheaper
here than they are in London.
- They always are aren't they?
- Good Lord!
- There's a waxworks museum here.
- Yes.
- Let's go and have a quick look see.
- Oh no. It's sure to be dull and it's such a nice day.
I haven't seen one since I was a kid. Come on!
- Yes you're quite right. It is rather dull.
- Let's go.
Wait a minute.
What's over here?
Neville!
It's stuffy in here.
Let's go
She's beautiful.
She's almost alive.
She's lovely.
Goodbye Phillip.
Thanks for being such a marvellous host.
Not at all. It was my pleasure.
I'm only sorry you can't stay.
No, I'd better fly back, I'm late now.
Sure I can't give you a lift into town?
No thanks. I'm not going in today.
I'll be off then.
- Bye.
- Cheerio.
- Take care of yourself.
- Thanks for everything.
Chow.
Neville?
I helped myself.
Neville, I saw you at that museum.
I know. I came back to apologize.
I don't know why I went there.
I do. It was the face of Slaome, wasn't it?
Yes.
It was uncanny.
- It was almost as though...
- As though hse was standing there?
- Yes
- It's exactly what I felt.
That's why I tried to persuade
you not to go into that museum.
- There's something evil about that place.
- Yes, there is.
And I don't think either of us
should go there again, ever.
No.
Well!...
Would you like to stay here tonight?
No, I should have left before now as it is.
Phillip I'm sorry.
It was silly of me.
- Take care of yourself.
- Take care on the road.
I always do.
- Bye.
- Good luck.
Hello?
Hello Phillip, This is Neville.
Well hello Neville.
Anything wrong?
- I'm still at the village.
I'm staying at the hotel.
The Queens Head?
I know it sounds absurd Pillip,
but.. I can't leave here.
I've got to go back to that place
.
Don't go there!
You stay where you are. I'll be right over.
Neville?
I told you, that my wife was guillotined...
because she'd murdered my best friend.
Well.. it was I who killed him.
And made sure she was found near him.
Can you guess why?
The Authorities let me
have her body.
And I embalmed her in all her beauty
so that she would be mine.. forever.
But she drew men to her,
even after her death.
Others came and admired her,
like your friend and you.
But you shall never have her.
None of you.
She is beautiful. Isn't she?
My Salome.
- And Henderson moved in next.
- No Sir, there was someone else before him.
- Another disaster?
- Of a sort!.
Not like the others.
Not like the others at all.
It's that house.
There's something about it.
- What?
- I don't know Sir!
I see.
Well... I think it's about
time I paid a call...
...on the gentleman who's responsible
for renting that house.
What's his name, Stoker?
- I tried to warn them.
- Warn them of what?
- The house.
- What about it?
Haven't you guessed its
secret yet.
What secret?
What sort of a place do
you live in Inspector?
Well, a plain ordinary flat.
Quite comfortable.
A bit on the cold side perhaps?
- What do you mean?
- Never mind.
Shall we get down to facts.
I'm here regarding a dissapearance.
Now I'd like to know who lived in that
house before Paul Henderson moved in.
The tenant just prior to him
was a gentleman called Reid.
John Reid.
Quiet man.
And although I didn't
realise it at the time...
...a dangerous one.
- Dangerous?
- To himself.
Jane?
Come along.
Well Mr Reid,
you see I haven't exaggerated.
You and your daughter would
have no difficuilties keeping it up.
No, I suppose not.
May I see the rest of it please?
Yes of sourse.
Let me show you the study.
I think you're going to like this.
Lots of room.
With a bit of re-arranging,
make a play room for your daughter.
- What a very lovely child she is.
- Yes, Jane?
- A bit cold in here isn't it?
- Oh, no problem.
- This would make a nice play room.
- Yes.
- What frightened her Sir?
- It was er... fire.
She's a little nervous of fire.
I see.
Well, it's a standard lease,
seems perfectly in order.
- Just needs your signature.
- Good.
There's just one other thing I'd like
you to do for me Mark, if you would.
Yes?
My business brings me up to
London quite a bit as you know.
I need somebody to look after my daughter,
preferably someone who will teach her as well.
You're still against sending
her to boarding school?
You know my views on that subject.
Yes I do.
Well, you sign, there and there.
I'd hoped you might have changed your mind.
- No.
- Well, I shall have to get someone very soon.
- Mr Reid?
- Yes.
- I'm Anne Norton.
- Come in.
I've been expecting you since noon.
Ah, yes, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I got
a bit confused by the directions.
Anyway, I took a wrong turn.
Yes.
Please sit down.
- Now Miss Norton...
- Mrs Norton.
I'm a widow.
When you telephoned yesterday,
you said that you'd been a school teacher.
Before I was married.
Do you still think that you are capable
of handling the education of a child?
In the classes I taught I had
more than 40 children.
None of them was like
Jane Mrs Norton.
Why don't you want your
daughter in school Mr Reid?
Is she a problem child?
I suggest you find that out for
yourself. She's in the study.
Please.
Hello Jane.
I'm Mrs Norton.
Mind if I sit down?
You know you and I really
should get aquainted...
...from now on we'll be spending
a lot of time together.
I'm a teacher, Jane.
Your father has asked me to come
here and help you with your lessons.
Well then!.
I can see we won't have any
problem finding books to study.
We've a new set of encyclopedias.
What a nice room you have here.
I hate it!.
Everythings so cosy and cheerful.
Come on. lets go by the fireplace
and have a nice chat.
NO!
Jane?
Look at me, Jane.
That's better.
Friends should always speak
face to face. Don't you think so?
Particularly when they
have problems to discuss.
You know, if you tell me what's wrong...
...I might be able to help you.
Is it the fire?
- He always has it going.
- Of course. It would be too cold in here withou...
Jane, I'm going to ask you something.
You don't have to answer me
if you don't want to but...
...but I do hope you will.
It's about fire.
Have you ever been burned?
Did it happen to somebody else,
somebody you knew and loved?
I'm glad.
Fire can never harm us
so long as we're careful.
So there's really nothing
to worry about, is there.
Do you know. Iv'e often wondered
just what we'd do without fire.
Did you ever stop to think
how much it helps us?
It keeps us warm,
It cooks our food,
even gives us light.
Besides, it's really very pretty.
I love to watch the flames dancing,
Don't you?
Sometimes it's nice just to see
the way the colours change.
Look!
There's all sorts of shapes.
I never get tired of watching.
Better?
I'm afraid your daughter does have problems.
- Your'e not interested in taking the position then?
- Oh on the contrary Mr Reid.
I'm going to stay.
This river goes to a big river which
flows into the Ocean, far, far away. See?
Perhaps we could go on a
trip some day on a boat.
- Maybe even as far as the Ocean, would you like that?
- Yes.
Alright, come on then, it's getting late.
Let's go home to tea.
"Oh, I've had such a curious dream said Alice".
And she told her sister as well
as she could remember them...
- ... All those strange ad... ad...
- Adventures.
Adventures of hers that you
have just been reading about.
...and when she had finished
her sister kissed her...
...and said. "It was a curious dream dear".
"Certainly but now run in to your
tea, it is getting late. "
It is getting late.
I think we've accomplished
quite a bit today, don't you?
I liked Alice in Wonderland. "
Did you? You read it very well.
My father taught me. He said it would
give me something to do when I was alone.
Where you always alone Jane?
Have you never had other children to play with?
My father doesn't like me
to play with children.
So, all you've had are your toys?
My father doesn't want
me to play with toys either.
Well... were going to have
to do something about that.
- Where are you going?
- To make us some lunch.
- Do you want to come and help?
- I'd rather just stay here now.
- And do what?
- Watch the fire.
I'm not afraid of it anymore.
Ever since you told me how
you could see shapes in it...
- ... I can see things too.
- What sort of things?
Pretty ones. Sometimes
I can see my mother.
Her mother?
Rediculous!
Her mother died when Jane was only a baby.
She Couldn't possibly remember her.
I'm sure she must have
seen photo's of your wife.
I haven't any photo's Mrs Norton.
They aren't necessary.
Jane is all I need to remind me of her mother.
She's the living image of her. She grows
more and more like her every day.
Then your wife must have been
a very beautiful woman.
Very.
Was she as lonely as Jane?
- Mrs Norton...
- That's your daughters real problem.
Loneliness.
there's a park in town with a playground.
- I could take her...
- No that's out of the question.
But surely contact with other
youngsters would only help her.
NOT YET. Please. I do have my reasons.
- I'd be glad to hear them.
- You shall. All in good time.
Until then I must ask you to be patient.
Alright.
On one condition.
I want to buy Jane some toys.
- Good evening, Jane.
- Hello.
- Did you have a nice day?
- Yes thankyou.
I hoped I might find you studying
those lessons I left for you.
- They're all finished.
- Oh, good.
- Now, I've got some other things here for you to look at.
- Toys?
Yes. I told you I was going shopping.
Paint box,
jigsaw puzzle,
A word game.
But first I want you to see this...
She's very beautiful.
Go on.
Take her.
- What shall we call her?
- Give me that!
Where did this come from?
You gave me permission
to buy some toys.
Educational toys Mrs Norton, not... THIS.
- That was a cruel thing to do.
- But necessary.
Why do you treat her like this. Is it because
you blame her for what happened to your wife?
No. I was glad
when she died.
- Glad?
- Yes Glad!
Because by then, I'd found
out what she really was.
There are all kinds of trees here Jane,
I want you to tell me their names.
- What's that one?
- Silver Birch.
Good. Yes.
And that one there, what's that?
- A green Oak.
- Quite right.
- And what about that one?
- Walnut.
Very good. You do
know your trees.
That's very good indeed.
Now. What about this one here,
This dark green one?
- That's a Yew tree.
- Quite right.
You know something Mrs Norton. In olden times
Yew trees used to be evil magic trees.
- How did you know that Jane?
- I read it in a book.
Jane?
Jane?
Lunch is ready.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
WITCHCRAFT.
- Quite a storm isn't there?
- Yes, there is.
- Jane in bed?
- All safe and sound.
- She was asleep when I looked in.
- Good.
- You wanted to talk to me about something?
- Yes, I do.
- Sit down please.
- Thankyou.
Mr Reid. You bring your daughter to
an isolated old house in the country...
...you shut her off from
all outside contacts...
...you even hired me as a private tutor so
that she doesn't have to be with other children.
Jane is frightened.
Not half as frightened as her father
That's absurd Mrs Norton.
Is it. Then why did you
throw that doll on the fire?
There must be a power failure
I'll get some candles.
That's funny, they're not in the dresser.
- Are you sure that's where you put them?
- Quite positive.
What is it?
- What's wrong?
- There are only 4 candles here.
There are only 4 candles here,
where are the others?
What did you do with them?
Where are they?
- Mr Reid?
- Yes?
There's a telephone call for you.
Alright. I'll come down.
Hello?
Yes.
Good.
So their all ready to sign?
Yes.
Alright then.
This afternoon.
What time?
Three?.
Yes that'll be alright.
Yes I'll drive in.
Fine. I may be a bit late.
Traffic's probably going to be rather heavy.
But I'll get there, well,
I'll get there as close to three as I can, alright.
Goodbye.
Will you sign there, on the
bottom of all four copies.
What's the matter?
John, what is it?
My arm!
Jane?
Come on dear, it's a lovely day
let's go for a walk.
Alright.
It's gone now.
Are you sure?
Can I get you a drink?
No, no. I'm perfectly alright thankyou.
I'm sorry.
Mr Reid?
What is it?
- Chest... Pains... Chest...
- I'll get a doctor.
No, no, no, no, don't!
Hello Dr Brady?
Can you come around at once?
This is Mrs Norton,
Yew Tree House.
Yes, I'm afraid it is very urgent, yes.
Thankyou so much.
We'll be expecting you.
Nothing wrong with your heart.
No fever.
Pulse and respiration normal.
- And you say the pains gone?
- Yes, quite gone.
Well, I suggest you stop by
my office tomorrow.
We'll take a few lab tests and x-rays.
Probably just an old fashioned
case of indigestion.
Well, I shall expect you in the morning
Goodnight.
Goodnight doctor.
Thankyou doctor.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Are you sure you're feeling better?
- Yes I'll be alright now.
- Then I'll say goodnight.
- Anne
Anne, I know you haven't understood
why I'm treating Jane the way I do.
I didn't ever want to tell you,
but...
...now I know I've got to.
It's because I'm afraid of her, just
as I was afraid of her mother before her.
- Afraid of a child?
- She's not just a child.
She's evil.
Those candles I was looking for, she
made a wax imge of me out of them.
You must find it. You must search the
house, but you must find that doll!
You must find it,
before it's too late.
Jane?, Jane?
Jane?
Give me that doll.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give me the doll, Jane.
I promise you nothing will happen.
We'll go on just as before.
Nothing will happen.
Give me the doll, Jane.
He said I didn't have a real doll.
This isn't real,
It's only wax.
Come on darling, give me the doll,
please, please, give me the doll.
Jane.
JANE!
It wasn't the man.
Or the child.
Or what either of them believed,
that caused the tragedy.
It was the house.
Look I'm not interested in
superstitions but in facts.
About it's next occupant.
Paul Henderson, the film star
who disappeared.
Yes, that's the case I'm on.
Understand the house, and you might
find out what happened to him.
What do you mean?
He only wanted the
house for a short time.
I tried to discourage him from taking it
- Why?
- I didn't think he'd be happy there.
Not with his personality.
Still, if he really wanted it.
I remember waiting for him to arrive.
Yes.
Yes, I like it.
You see, I told you this place is
absolutely ideal for you.
Yes, well it's just for a few months
while were shooting the picture.
Of course the main advantage is it's
less than an hours deive from the studio.
Hmm, does seem quite comfortable.
- Before you decide...
- I've already decided, to take it.
In that case I feel that it is only fair to warn you...
- Warn me?
- The former tenants...
There were erm... tragedies.
Are you trying to tell me
that this house is haunted?
Not exactly.
What a pity.
I would have liked a ghost.
You see it isn't that I just star in the horror pictures.
I'm an expert on the whole subject.
Ghosts, vampires, werewolves
withces, demons.
In fact there's very little I don't know
on the subject of the supernatural, Mr erm...
- Stoker.
- Stoker?
That's true. this is the third film Mr Henderson
and I will have made together...
...And I know him pretty well by now.
At heart he is pure Gothic.
You know, Paul...
...Sometimes I think you'd feel more
at home in some medievel castle.
Yes.
Yes that's right.
Castle.
- You approve Mr Henderson?
- Yes
Oh yes Mr Pepridge.
I approve of this.
- But hardly of that.
- Call sheet for tomorrow, Mr Henederson.
Any similarity between this model
and that set is purely coincidental.
It's all we could afford on the budget.
Paul, I'm so sorry.
Everything alright I hope.
No, everything is not alright.
As long as you and your art director here...
...insist on my acting in this rabbit hutch.
What's wrong with it?
Tell me Mr Townage. Since leaving
the depressing confines of television...
- ... How many films have you made?
- Well, actually this is my second.
But your first horror film.
Well, let me tell you mr Townage...
...I have made hundreds of 'em.
Hundreds.
Oh, my God...
And if I go on working for this company
I shall finish up looking like him.
Look at the scenery.
Look at it!
Look.
So flimsy you could
blow peas through it.
Please Mr Henderson,
it's been freshly painted.
That's what's wrong with your
present day horror films.
There's no realism.
Not like the old ones now.
Great Ones
Frankenstein
Phantom of the Opera, Dracula.
The one with Bella Lugosi of
course not this new fella.
They didn't have freshly painted scenery.
Well, I.. I'm sure you'll
like you vampire costume.
Rita, will you please bring over
the cloak for Mr Henderson?
Who did this belong to?
The flying Nun.
It looks perfectly alright to me.
My dear fellow it's too new
It's not sinister enough.
I want a wardrobe that
look as if it's been lived in.
Or died in.
Well, what do you expect us to do?
Rob a graveyard?
Take this shmutter away madam.
Use it for draperies.
But were scheduled to start shooting
tomorrow we haven't time...
...to find anything else.
Well it looks as though I shall have to
find something for myself, doesn't it?
Mr Henderson?
Wardrobe mistresses, inaffectual art
directors low budget pictures.
Curse of the Blood Suckers.
Come.
Your call sheet for tomorrow Mr Henderson.
By the way, somebody left this card
on my dressing room mirror, any idea who it was?
- None at all Mr Henderson.
- Right thankyou.
THEO VON HARTMANN -
THEATRICAL COSTUMES AND WIGS
Hello?
Anybody here?
Shop?
May I be of some assistance?
- Er.. you are er...
- Yes, I am von Hartmann.
- You are a celibrant?
- I beg your pardon?
Oh, I see what you mean.
- No, of course I have performed the black mass on many occasions.
- Ah!
In my films you understand?
My name is Henderson.
Paul Henderson?
The film actor.
I'm afraid Sir I do not
patronize the Kinema.
Yes Well, I.m looking for a cloak.
A cloak?
Yes, a long black cloak,
something old and worn.
The sort of theing that might have
been used by a Transylvanian Vampire.
- A vampires cloak?
- Yes, I was hoping to find something that looked authentic.
- It's so important, don't you think?
- I think I may be able to help you Sir.
I think this may well
be what you require Sir.
Try it on.
That's funny...
I felt a sort of chill.
Yes it's been a long time down below,
It's very cold down there.
Yes.
- How much are you asking for it?
- Shall we say 13 shillings?
That's an odd sum.
13 shillings a week?
No my dear Sir, 13 shillings
and it's yours... for life.
Well that seems very reasonable.
10, 11, 12, 13.
I shall soon be closing this establishment.
I only hope you put the cloak to its proper use.
My dear Mr von Hartmann,
In my films there is nothing improper.
- Shall I put it in a bag?
- Thankyou no.
I'll take it over my arm.
My car is just outside.
- Good day Sir and thankyou.
- THANK YOU.
Now I shall be able to rest... in peace.
Come.
- Ready in two minutes Mr Henderson.
- Right, thankyou.
Come.
- Were ready for you now Sir.
- Right thankyou.
- I'll bring the cloak for you Sir.
- Yes, thankyou.
We'll come into close-up
half way through the scene.
And cut, just after you kiss her.
Then makeup will put in your
fangs for the next shot.
And we'll come in from the other
angle as you raise your head.
Look I have done this sort
of thing before you know?
Yes well I think we'll try a take.
Kill the house lights.
Quiet please,
quiet.
Turn over.
- Scene, mark it.
- 27, take one.
Action!
Must you really go?
- It's almost midnight.
- I'm not afraid.
Even though your father believes that
in my family there runs a thirst for blood?
You mustn't take him seriously.
He still believes in the old
superstitions of our land.
That at the stroke of 12
the vampire must feast.
- But do you believe it?
- I only know that I love you.
Goodbye, my dearest.
Cut!
- Ok?
- Ok!...
Paul!
Paul!
You beast!
You bit me!
Paul That's a very splendid performance but you
really don't have to get quite so carried away.
PLEASE BE A BLOOD DONOR
- Egg roll?
- You know I'm vegetarian.
- Morning Mr Henderson.
- Good morning.
- What scenes are we doing today?
- 24, 35, 53 a 89.
- None with the cloak?
- No Sir.
- Thank God. has miss Lynde arrived yet?
- Yes Sir, she's over there.
Carla, I really must apologize
for what happened yesterday.
I don't know what came over me.
I've been playing vampires for years but
I've never actually bitten anybody before.
- Then why start on me?
- Carla, please.
Am I forgiven?
Alright, Paul,
but it will cost you a dinner.
Then back to my cottage
afterwards for champagne.
If you promise I'll be safe with you?
Safe as houses.
Thankyou for a lovely dinner, Paul.
My dear Carla. It's the least I
could do under the circumstances.
- Let me re-charge your glass.
- Thankyou.
- It's rather good, don't you think?
- No.
Doesn't do you justice.
- Good heavens...
- What is it?
Listen to this:
Fire destroys costumery shop.
The salvage authorities
investigating the cause of the fire.
Are puzzled by the discovery of a coffin
buried in the earth of the cellar...
...beneath the shop,
containing the body of an elderly man.
Although dead for years the body
was quite well preserved...
...And death appeared
to be from natural causes.
- It's von Hartmann.
- Who?
The man from whom I brought my cloak.
He said he was closing the place...
...and was glad to find someone to give it to.
- Well, that someone was me.
- What are you talking about?
I'll show you what I'm talking about.
This.
I asked for something authentic,
well don't you see, this is authentic.
That old man was a vampire
and this was his cloak.
He had to pass it on to someone
before he could die.
Carries his spirit and transfers his
blood lust to whoever wears it.
I know about these things,
I've read all about them.
That's why I bit you last night
and that's why I... I...
- Excuse me.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to burn it.
- Oh, surely you don't...
Look it's only an old cloak.
Every time I wear this
I'll turn into a vampire.
- Nonsense, put it on prove to yourself.
- No!
Look at the time it's nearly
midnight, the witching hour.
There's no telling what might happen.
- Paul, I think you are afraid.
- Me, afraid?
Nonsense.
Prove to yourself that it's
only a silly superstition.
Come on, put it on.
Very well, but I must say, I'm
not over keen on the idea.
You see, nothing happened.
Well, I can't understand it.
PROPERTY OF
SHEPPERTON STUDIOS
Wait a minute, this isn't my cloak.
No.
This one is.
Carla.
Carla, no!
Carla.
No Carla, no!
Carla, don't put that on,
you'll turn into a vampire.
Carla!
Carla, please!
We love your films so much...
...we wanted you to
become one of us forever.
Welcome to the club.
Carla!
Carla!
Don't be ridiculous Carla,
this is going too far.
Carla! Carla! Carla!
You must be joking.
Now what sort of a crazy story is that?
Oh, I just thought it might amuse you.
Look I'd like to see the house,
May I have the keys please.
If you wait until the morning,
I'd be most happy to accompany you.
No, I'd like to see the house tonight.
One question if I may.
In your job do you ever give
anyone another chance.
Someone who's not likely
to commit a crime again?
All crimes must be paid
for, that's the law.
I'd not advise your going
to the house, not alone.
The keys please.
You've heard what's happened there,
haven't you fathomed its secret yet?
The keys please.
I still say you'd do better
to wait until the morning.
- The electricity is cut off.
- I know what I'm doing.
Do you?
No!
Perhaps you understand
the secret of this house now?
Precisely.
It reflects the personality
of whoever lives in it.
And treats him accordingly.
I hope it finds a proper tenant soon.
Perhaps you would like it?
There's nothing to be afraid of!
If you're the right sort of person.
Think it over.
