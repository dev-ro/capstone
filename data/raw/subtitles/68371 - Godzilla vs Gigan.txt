GODZILLA VS. GIGAN
(CHIKYU KOGEKI MEIREI - GOJIRA TAI GAIGAN)
Get away!
It's the monster Shukura!
Is this monster
Shukura invisible?
Not really...
I'm still designing it.
Oh, so you're bringing
me unfinished work?
I'm sorry.
What kind of monster
is Shukura anyway?
It's a monster made
of homework.
Homework?!
It's what you told me!
You told me to find out...
...what the kids hate most and
then visualize it as a monster.
And that's your answer?
It's far too simple.
Kids are too sophisticated
for that kind of stuff.
I know that, but my monster is created by
the kids telepathic hatred of homework!
The waves stream into space and
their intensity forms into the monster!
It stinks, huh?
I wouldn't touch it!
Oh well...
And after all the trouble we went
through to get an introduction...
You'll just have to try
at another company.
Now... now, wait
just a moment!
I want to take a little break.
There's no time to take a break.
You have to keep going until
you can sell some ideas.
Here... This is the next place.
The World's Children's Land
construction committee.
Do you know of it?
That's where they're building
that Godzilla Tower.
That's right.
What's my job?
You want me to shovel dirt?
Just cut the humor
and let's go.
Now what's the matter?
I hired a nagging witch.
What...? Would you repeat
what you said just now?
Not really...
Not when you're a third
level black belt in karate.
How about it?
Quite impressive, isn't it?
And then, here is
the Godzilla Tower.
This was a very good idea.
Inside it will be a museum devoted
to all of the monsters of the world.
The elevator will take people up the
full height of his body into its head.
That's well over fifty meters.
We'll have aerial displays showing our
achievements on earth and in space.
The children will have rides,
dining rooms and lots of space...
...to explore and to have fun.
Here is a place where we can teach the
children all about how to have peace.
Peace...
Do you understand?
The kids already
have peace, right?
No...
The peace they have
now is an illusion.
What I'm talking
about is real peace.
That's the only thing that
will save the world.
Monsters and peace... Don't you
think that's a strange combination?
No...
In the childrenâ€™s' minds, monsters
and peace go hand in hand.
What about my job here?
What do you want me to do?
I want to make this place
even better than it is.
I want some ideas.
What do you think would help?
You'll need more monsters for
the children to play with.
Monsters like...
...Shukura and Mamagon.
Shukura and Mamagon?
The monsters of homework
and of strict mothers.
They're not good
enemies of peace, huh?
No, they're very good.
Start working on the designs.
Then, what about
Monster Island?
Have you ever thought about
bringing a monster from there?
Of course, I thought about it...
But the monsters there
are hardly peaceful...
... especially Godzilla.
We'll install models of them in the park,
and then Monster Island will be destroyed.
Destroyed?!
Yes...
We have to finally get rid
of all those monsters.
The monster of
homework, Shukura...
... and the monster of strict
mothers, Mamagon.
Yes, come in!
Congratulations! I heard you got the job!
The boss is very happy with you.
It's a big deal, but I just
can't stand the guy.
You can't afford to be fussy
about where you work, right?
Yeah, but I don't
like this assignment.
Gen...
What's your problem? They like you and
they're paying you pretty good, too.
Well, it's like this
place has no feelings.
You've never been
the sensitive type.
You can't afford to be now.
What don't you like there?
It's this "peace" thing.
Peace?
That's all he ever
talks about. Peace...
Isn't that nice?
Hey, what are they?
They're drawings that he wants
me to have ready for tomorrow.
But what are they?
Shukura and Mamagon.
Mamagon?
Was this suppose to
resemble something?
You made me a monster!
The World Children's
Land Committee Office...
... on the fifth floor.
Just a moment! You left
your tape! Your tape!
What are you doing here?!
Which way did she go?
Who do you mean?
The young girl!
Why do you care
where she went?
Which way did she go?!
Hello?
Hurry up and get in here!
Huh? In where?
The Chairman's office.
Just get in here.
Come here.
Who are you?
Genbo Odaka.
Oh, you're the artist that
I got the report on.
Who are you?
I'm the chairman.
Is something funny?
No, I'm just a bit surprised.
There's nothing surprising
or funny about it.
What's that?
It's the orbit of
Nebula M-Space Hunter.
Is that strange?
No, but I...
Chairman, we couldn't find her.
She got away from you?!
But, I'm sure we'll
catch her soon!
We need the Action 2 tape in order
to bring our plans to completion.
What is this Action 2 tape?
It contains information we
need to complete our plans.
Then, she's an industrial spy?
No, she's much worse than that.
She's an enemy of peace.
An enemy of peace?
That's right.
She wants to ruin what we've worked
so hard for, to bring peace to this planet.
Please give me the tape!
The tape?
I saw you pick it up!
But it isn't yours, is it?
Go ahead and get it.
It's not here!
It's not?!
What did you do with the tape?
What happened to it?
Tell me!
He must have fainted!
He probably thought I had a gun.
Just a moment!
The two of us aren't bandits!
But the pistol!
The pistol...? It was this.
I'm sorry! I should have tried to
tell you everything. I'm very sorry!
I'm Shosa Takashi.
And I'm Machiku Shima.
Please to meet you.
Thanks for the introductions.
I've never known bandits
to introduce themselves.
Hey, I told you we
weren't bandits!
But, you're enemies of peace!
The enemies of peace are
the Children's Land people!
The Children's Land people?
Well, I want you to tell me everything.
My brother is a computer technician who
has been working for Children's Land.
Children's Land?
Yes... He hasn't been home since he
went to work there three days ago.
When I went to find him, the Children's Land
people told me to mind my own business!
I'm sure something
terrible has happened!
My brother had been
acting very strange.
At first I thought he was
just working too hard.
But then I read his diary!
What did he say?
"Their plans are diabolical. The Children's
Land people are enemies of peace.
"It's all on computer tape!"
If it's all on tape...
That's why you stole one, huh?
That's right!
We think they were
catching on to her brother...
...and they had him locked up!
Where do they have him?
Unfortunately, we haven't
found that out.
Well, perhaps the
tape might help us.
Oh, I don't have it on me.
I didn't want anyone to find it,
so I put it in a coin locker.
Put the cases there.
Shima, don't think
about any sabotage.
What was that? This coming
from people holding me captive?
You're not a captive.
We only want to hold you
here for a little while.
That's kidnapping
in any law book!
We're sorry about that, but we
were left with no other choice.
There will come a time that you will
thank us for holding you like this.
Thank you?!
That's right.
There's no other machinery
on the earth like this.
When our work is completed...
...you will become the foremost
authority in the field of electronics.
Chairman!
What is that?
Someone is playing
the Action 2 tape!
That's bad!
Who the hell are you people?!
What could it be?
Maybe it's at the wrong speed.
It just doesn't
make any sense.
It stopped.
The tape must be finished.
What do we do?
We'll have to modify
the computer program.
Change plan #3 to plan #6.
Yes, sir.
The humans won't be able
to understand the tape.
Only the monsters of Monster Island
will know what it means.
Hey, Angilas!
What is it?
Check out the immediate area.
Do it fast!
Hey!
Good afternoon.
What are you doing here?
I was looking for you.
Here are the designs you wanted.
This is my brother's!
Look! The "T. S." stand
for his initials!
What's your brother's name?
Takeshi Shima.
Where did you find it?
At the Godzilla Tower.
Well, was he alright?
I didn't see everyone there,
but I'm sure that he's there too!
Finding him is going
to be really tough.
This is getting more
suspicious by the minute.
Damn, what's all this
crap about peace?!
There has to be some kind of significance
behind this perfect peace they talk about.
There's something really odd
about the chairman, too.
They call him the chairman,
but he's only a child.
He seems to be a whiz
at mathematics as well.
He does coordinate
geometry for fun.
When I first met him, do you want to
know what he told me he was working on?
He said he was calculating the orbit
for the M-Space Hunter Nebula.
The M-Space Hunter Nebula?
Do you know it?
No, I've never
heard if it. Here...
We can't afford to do any snooping
around the Godzilla Tower.
This is tough, huh?
Sometimes I'm so stupid
I'm ashamed of myself!
What is it?
We should start building
on what we already know.
I don't have a clue to what
you're talking about.
It's like this...
We should start with a little digging
into the backgrounds of these people.
Then we can find out what the people
of Children's Land are really up to.
He's right. We can find out where the
chairman and the secretary really come from.
Alright...
Let's go to city hall.
Right. Let's go!
Here's what I got.
The organization behind Children's Land
is the Children's International Federation.
All of their funding comes
from private donations...
...so there are no strings
attached to the money.
Therefore, they can do anything they want
with their funds with no questions asked.
A non-profit organization?
That's suspicious.
Their headquarters?
In Switzerland.
Yeah, that's just too convenient.
How about you?
I did some checking
on the secretary.
I bet his story was a fake.
No, he's from the immediate area.
He comes from the Yamanoshi
district, along Route 38.
Yamanoshi?!
The guy they call the
chairman is from that area too!
His name is Fumio Sudo, age 17.
It could be a coincidence, but...
I don't believe in
coincidences like that.
He's right.
Okay, let's check it out.
How far is it to Yamanoshi?
It's about 40 kilometers.
We'll be there in an hour.
Is this the home
of the chairman?
I wonder who's performing
the priest chant?
Sorry to intrude!
Is anybody here?
Good afternoon.
We're sorry to bother you.
What can I do for you?
We are looking for a
boy named Fumio Sudo.
Fumio?
Yes, where is he now?
Fumio isn't here.
Well, how about Tokyo?
What are you talking about?
Fumio has been dead for a year now.
Today is the anniversary date.
That's impossible!
Ma'am?
These gentlemen came
here to see Fumio.
That's impossible. Fumio has
moved on to a much better place.
But, we just saw him in Tokyo!
Don't be absurd!
I performed last rites on him myself!
You couldn't have seen him!
It must have been someone else.
Well, is it possible for us
to see a photograph?
Sorry to bother you.
- Thank you.
Just a moment.
Well, if you really saw him, what kind
of business is Fumio involved in?
He's the chairman of
Children's Land.
Children's Land?
Is that a fancy name
for a psychiatric institution?
It's a non-profit organization.
Oh, really?
The Fumio we met...
...was an intelligent young man.
In fact, I'd say that he was a genius.
That settles it! The person
you know couldn't be him!
They say that before he died,
he was as thick as two short planks.
This is the most recent
photo I could find.
Thank you.
Who is this man beside him?
That was his teacher, Kubota.
Kubota?
He was Fumio's English teacher.
One year ago today...
...they were killed in a climbing
accident at Mount Yamano.
That's right...
I have to arrange a ceremony for both of
them tonight at the temple. Well, then...
They've been dead for a year?
How could that be possible?!
We're receiving a message
from headquarters.
Activate the translator.
Yes, sir.
The plan has been approved.
Prepare for our arrival.
Our forces are on the move.
Begin transmission of Action 1 tape.
Wait!
Stay out of this.
What kind of tape is that?!
It's a tape of peace.
Peace?! Peace for who?!
It's Angilas! Angilas has been
spotted entering Sagami Bay!
Self Defense Force!
Mobilize ground forces!
Halt!
Move out!
Take positions!
Spotlights!
Spotlights!
Commence attack!
Chairman, what do we do now?
How do we handle Shima?
We now know the strength
of the earth forces.
We no longer need to use
him as a sample.
Shima...?
Who are you?
It is you Shima, right?
Yes, it is.
Hey!
What are you doing?
I was looking for you, and
I thought I would take a rest.
I'm really tired.
My office isn't around here.
I'm still a new employee,
so I wouldn't know.
What brings you here so late?
It's about my designs
of Shukura and Mamagon.
I wanted to get your
opinion of them.
What? Is that all?
It's not just that!
You said you wanted them
done as soon as possible.
I want to get the designs
finished for you. That's the truth!
You have no business
being up here.
You should only report
to the office.
Go home.
Is that so?
Well, I'll be going.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey!
Cigarettes?
Enjoy them.
Thank you.
I'll enjoy them very much!
What do you think
about that man?
He's not very bright but
he's also cunning.
We'll add him to our list
of interesting specimens.
Your brother is being held prisoner
at the park's Godzilla Tower.
Are you sure?
Did you manage to see him?
No, I didn't.
They got him locked away.
I managed to speak
to him briefly.
Hello... So, all of you
are in on this?
How did you find us here?
The cigarettes... They all have a
transmitter inside them.
Is that how you did it?
You thief!
You're the ones who are thieves.
You stole this tape from us. Unfortunately,
you know a little too much now.
What are you going to do?
Good evening.
Well, I'm sorry to
keep you waiting...
The sponsor!
Are you people sure of
what you're saying?
We're sure! You have to
raid Godzilla Tower!
Something terrible is
happening there!
So we're to go on your say so?
We've already told
you the reasons!
This girl's brother is being
held prisoner there.
That's right! It's the truth!
This is my brother's lighter!
This report just in from the
Monster Island Control Center.
Godzilla and Angilas are
heading for the Kanto district.
All units are to
standby for orders!
We're receiving the pilot's
signal from Nebula Hunter.
Good...
Synchronize the conductor.
Roger.
We're ready to proceed.
Chairman.
Good.
We've waited a long
time for this moment.
We came to earth in search
of eternal peace for us all.
A perfect peace...
And now, we're going to
see our hope come true.
Look... They turned on the
lights in the eyes.
I believe that's close to the
room where Shima is being held.
There don't appear to be
any guards around.
Well, we're going in. You two continue
with the plan that we discussed.
The elevator will probably be
guarded, so we better not take it.
Come on.
Let's rest!
What are you doing?!
Where do you think we are?!
Come on, let's hurry!
Thank you.
You should consider
yourselves quite lucky.
Why would you think
we were lucky?
I was going to have you all killed,
but the plans have changed.
It looks bad...
It's already been ten minutes.
Then, you think
they've been caught?
I think so.
We can't help it...
Let's start our plan.
We want you and your friends
as what we call "uniforms"...
...for our friends who
are coming soon.
"Uniforms"?
Yes, that's what I said.
Are you wearing uniforms now?
We are wearing a human version now,
but there have been many others.
We've tried many experiments...
...and found that humans are
more receptive than other species.
What kind of creatures
are you guys?!
Alright, I'll show you.
Observe...
In the vast regions
of the universe...
...you are not the only sentient
beings who live in it.
You can't imagine how closely your earth
matches the conditions of our planet.
We thought that our planet in Nebula M
was the only one of its kind.
Its people were much like
the people of earth...
... and they worked to create
a great civilization.
However, they had set out
to ruining the planet...
... despoiling it, just you are
doing with the earth.
For years they ravaged the planet with
their pollution, their destructive wars...
... and their toxic chemicals.
You can't imagine you are destroying the earth
in the same way they destroyed that world.
Our planet was polluted to the
point where everyone died off...
... and we see the same thing
happening to the earth.
Although the humanoids had died, one
species managed to survive their disaster.
We are that species.
We then began building our own
civilization using a new technology.
But even though our
planet had life...
...it wasn't enough
for us to survive.
Then you want to take
over the earth?
The conditions are favorable
for our survival.
Well they're not very good, but we
can make it peaceful enough for us.
Peaceful? Who is it going
to be peaceful for?!
For our species, of course.
Just what exactly
is your species?
A species capable of surviving in
the worst possible conditions.
Activate the emergency generators!
Yes, sir!
A cockroach?
Now you understand.
Humans are perfect
for our needs.
Sir, I have two contacts
appearing on my radar.
They're approaching the
planet at mach 4 speed!
Activate our satellite
laser receivers.
Yes, sir.
Those are space monsters.
One is King Ghidorah.
The second one I don't know...
It's the first I've heard of it.
Self Defense Force!
Report to action stations!
Observe... We control the
two space monsters.
The three-headed one
is King Ghidorah.
That one is Gigan.
Those monsters...
...are controlled by action programs
imprinted on these two tapes.
We needed both of those tapes in order
to control both King Ghidorah and Gigan.
I want both monsters to proceed to Tokyo!
Destroy everything within the city!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Move faster!
Our plans for peace are going smoothly.
It's better than we anticipated.
I hope Machiku makes it alright.
Of course she'll make it.
It's all part of my plan.
That's what worries me.
His plans have never worked at all.
Hey, cut it out.
This is no time for bickering.
This is the latest report
on the monsters.
The monsters reportedly
came from space...
... and are attacking industrial
areas of the city.
The Self Defense Force has been mobilized
in an effort to try and destroy them.
Chairman, Godzilla has
finally arrived.
Godzilla is a necessary
part of our plans.
We must lure him to the park,
and then we can destroy him!
Gen, look!
Good...
They know we're here.
Latch the hook onto that rail.
Alright, get going.
Okay, here I go!
Be careful.
Brother!
- Machiku!
Are you alright?
The guards will be here! Let's go!
The prisoners have escaped.
Fools!
Activate the targeting system!
Roger!
Oh, if we had been in that car...
We would be barbequed by now.
That's useful information.
They seem to rely on anything technological.
If there's anyone wrapped up
in technology, it's those guys.
You're right.
Well it's our advantage. Japan isn't
as dependant as they are. Let's go!
Godzilla is approaching
our firing range.
It's going as planned.
Are our lasers ready for firing?
They're ready.
Watch it!
When Godzilla is defeated, nothing will be
able to stop the completion of our plans!
These guys aren't human!
They're aliens that have come
here from another planet!
We have to stop them!
But what can we do?
All of my forces are currently
engaged with the monsters.
However, you can't remain idle!
Perhaps Godzilla can stop them.
This isn't for Godzilla!
If Godzilla gets within
range of their lasers...
...they may be able
to destroy him!
We can't afford to
attack Godzilla Tower.
King Ghidorah and Gigan are
defending it from any of our forces.
It's likely that a rocket attack would
be useless against the tower anyway.
I understand. But, what
about from the inside?
The inside?
That's right. They're so busy
watching the battle...
...our enemy won't expect a small
group to attack from inside.
Yes, that's one way...
Laser beams, fire!
Godzilla's in trouble!
Come on, let's go!
Alright! Let's go!
Behold! Godzilla is finished!
The elevator is on its way up!
It's them. Take your men
and deal with it.
We did it!
Secretary, where are you?
Here... Here I am...
What happened?
The machines were
working so well!
What could have caused
them to fail?
What happened to them?
Is Godzilla going to be okay?
I don't know...
But I'm sure that the space monsters
aren't being controlled anymore.
Godzilla looks like
he's feeling better!
Godzilla won!
It looks like we did it, huh?
Yes, Godzilla Tower is destroyed.
They wanted peace.
It's a difficult thing to have.
They thought it was easy to achieve, but
their peace wouldn't have been good for us.
What's the matter?
A roach!
Maybe they were right.
Maybe the roaches will inherit the
earth if we keep spoiling its resources.
You're right.
Godzilla's going home!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye! Goodbye!
