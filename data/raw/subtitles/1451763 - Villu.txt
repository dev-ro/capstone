Oh my God!
Why did you do this to me?
I offered you help, didn't l?
Why did you try to bury me?
Is it your gift for offering a lift?
Hey, why are you looking up

I think I'm in for a thrashing.
How long have you been watching me?
Don't go on say I had seen you...
it's giving me shivers...
Sir, nothing happened as you're
imagining...Oh my god!
- Hey Jahnavi, come here...
- No...
Who is she?
What happened?
Fishes may got bored biting local girls,
so they are bursting with excitement
on seeing a girl from abroad.

Why are you afraid of fishes now?
Hey look there... oh my God!
Carefully...
Who is this?

Isn't he very handsome?
So I thought of making him my lover.
Is there any doctor nearby, Jyothi?
Hey, first check if he is alive?
He's alive.
Thank God! I got back my life.
Hey, first press his stomach.
Why isn't he spitting out water?
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
can bring back the life.
- Do it yourself...
- No, I won't...
I'm getting married next week...
no way!
Oh no! How can we do with
her marriage next week?
Hey Jahnavi, it's not a sin in emergency.
It's common in foreign, isn't it?
- You do it...
- She is right. You do this...
Oh my God!
A lotus is kissing lips.
A new wave of electricity is

First marriage in the family.
Kiss... kiss... Krishna...
Sit down.
It's him only.
That rascal has come here also.

Are you a buffalo or cow?
I meant the milk...
- Cow...
- I'm Buffalo.
Get one cow's milk coffee
and one buffalo milk coffee.

I mean your room is
opposite bathroom.
I'll show you how nasty I can be.
Have this and take bath and freshen up.
Our homemade idlies are
very soft and tender.
Be ready with 2 softies,
I'll come back.
I laughed.
Inform me before you laugh.
- I'm going to laugh again.
- oh my God!
First, I'll break his waist.
It's a sparking fire...
I'm a young commander...I'm great...
Oh no!
I'm a free bird.
- Good morning, sister.
- Good morning brother.
I'll have a peaceful bath.
you have made my head turn conical.
you scoundrel!
- jyothi...
- What?
you switch off the main.
Why?
Have you seen fully?
Shit! Do what I say!
- oh God!
- Hey Jyothi...
Switch it on only when I give a whistle.
As you say.
Are you singing?
It's very hot....
Wait...I'll rip out your skin
with this hot water...
1...2...3...Oh no!
What's it brother?
- Taking stream bath?
- Made me fall into the ditch I dug for you.
Forget about this,
I forgot to bring the soap, get it.
Are you asking me to get the soap?
I'll fix you now.
Watch now,
what am I going to do to you.
God!
Me?
Me...?
Don't rush,
I'll close the door.
you don't want me to...
I'll come right away.
She scolded me a little while ago
but inviting me now.
Look how crazy she is!
I just can't understand these girls.
Soap!
Oh my God!
Why am I hearing
an old woman's shriek?
Will you please get up?
Where's he?
Look down, not up above!
Brother! What are you doing down there?
I'm having fun!
- Get up, you fool!- okay.
Sleeping on me?
- Brother, take good rest.
- Where is he?
How nasty my life has become...
Everything is going against me.
- How many?
- just one!
just one? Want him dead or alive?
Want him as living dead or dead living?
- or else make him a vegetable...?
- No...no...
Don't go to that extent, he must
shudder on hearing my name.
Cool!
Look there, it's him!
- He looks like a boy.
- Come.
Do we need a lorry to crush an ant?
Start the vehicle!
How many times I've told you
not to stand next to me?
It's paining me. Go!
The hand that beats will only embrace.
It's comfortable to lie on you.
Follow the leader and
it's success all the way.
Isn't there anyone?
I'm suffering alone here.
Isn't there anyone here to help me?
- I hear someone's cries...
- Don't you know?
It seems somebody hired goons
to beat up Pugal badly.
Poor man is on the
verge of death in fear.
Looks like he may not survive this night.
Oh my God!
I hired the goons to beat him up.
Bloody girl! say sorry to him
before he breathes his last.
Go!
Great leader!
Please don't beat me...spare me...
Please don't get scared.
- Who is it?
- it's me.
I heard you say something but the
thrashing I got has left me dazed.
Can you come little closer?
- you look like Jahnavi?
- it's me Jahnavi!
No, you're the devil who tried to
kill me by drowning in water.
No, you're the devil who tried to
kill me by drowning in water.
No...no...I hired goons
just to scare you.
But you're talking about killing...
They scared life out of me.
Don't cry no.
I did it just for fun...
Come my leader.
your fun has put my life in danger.
The fatal fever has returned
into my life again.
My mother said it was a wonder
to have survived earlier.
I'll not survive this time.
- Mother...
- What?
Who called you?
I called my mother.
Mother, I'm also coming to
the place you're now.
Oh my mother...I'm coming...
What happened?
Why are you shouting like this?
Oh my God!
I'm having severe chest pain!
Excuse me, if you don't mind...
Can I apply this balm?
- Saroja Devi! Take out your wares!
- What happened?
A girl mustn't apply it to a boy,
I said it in Hindi.
It's okay, it's not a sin in emergency.
you feel like that?
Apply on heart.
Heart is on the left side, right?
It's changing places for the stick I got.
For safer side, apply on both the sides.
Apply!
Apply!
If I knew you would apply so lovingly...
...I would've hurt my limbs too.
Oh my God!
- What happened?
- Severe headache.
I feel sleeping in your lap
will give some relief.
Did you call me?
Thank you very much, leader!
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
Even after a good bath the balm
is still lingering on me.
Poor girl! She's very innocent.
I'm telling her all white lies,
even mad won't believe them,
but she believed them.
- She believes whatever anyone says.
- He's caught!
I beat his two hands with my cheeks.
I hit his legs with my stomach.
I kicked his shoes with my butt.
Oh my butt!
Lastly I held him tightly under my leash.
Then what?
- I didn't leave him.
- Leave me.
Promise not to beat me, I'll leave.
Spared life after falling at feet.
If I ever see you again here...
Thanks a lot.
But how come you're hurt?
It's happens in politics.
Excuse me, I need Rs.5000
for hospital expenses.
For him. Poor man!
Take it.
Bloody!
you made a little mistake in the props.
If you'd replaced the tea
with milk and fruits...
What?
- Look behind...
- I'll....
- Snake?
- No, ghost!
I'm vanishing!
- Hello!
- Hello...hello...
Watch now, what I'm going to do now!
Why isn't the caller responding?
Save me...please save me.
Save...?
Hey control...
Who needs help?
Hey stop! I'll not spare you!
you fool! Stop!
She poured paint on me
and dares scold me too.
Country brute!
- Mummy!
- Daddy!
Get lost!
Oh my God!
We've reached the destination,
will you please get down?
Get down! Get down I say!
Oh my God!
What's the noise here?
Sixer!
- I want my ball.
- it's in the well, take it.
Fish it out for me.
- Stay out from me.- I want my ball.
I'll take care of myself.
Come, I'll fish it out for you.
- Bloody boy and his ball.
- I want my ball.
Shut up!
What's the problem?
- Ball fell into the well.
- Ball?
Why are you crying holding
her dress for that?
What if it comes down?
It's just a ball not your father, right?
Calm down, uncle will get
your ball out of the well.
- I can't see anything.
- Go inside and see.
Found the ball?
- Go away boy.
- Save me...save me...
Catch this bucket!
Hold it tightly.
What's going on here?
Brother, you are wet,

- Not like that...
Why are you teasing the groom?
Clear out.

Hey, groom doesn't know anything.
- I'll teach him!
- you silly girl!
you promised to get your
daughter married to my brother.
Why did you change now?
I'd rejected your proposal, hadn't I?
I came to know your brother is a goon,
womanizer, drunkard and a jail bird.
We are not interested in your proposal.
A man will drink and take a concubine.
Why are you talking to him?
I'll kidnap the girl!
Hey, please get out from here...

Brother, thanks a lot.
May God bless you.

Invite them for our daughter's baby shower.
- okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Has Jahnavi left to Chennai?
- She left early morning, Dad.
Ask anyone who is the Super Star?
Any child will answer this question.
Uttering your name will
enthuse the soul.
you must be wondering how to
save your crops from pests?
Don't worry.
Powder the dry Neem leaves
and bitter guard seeds,
mix 100 gms of it in one liter water,
and add 1 spoon of castor oil...
What's wrong with me?
Shit!
Something's really wrong with me.
Channels have worked out very well.
- Hello...
- Hello, it's me.
Pugal...?
Still remember me?
you left without informing me.
you promised to give me something.
It's alright.
I'm still wandering with your memories.
I see you in everyone I meet.
I see you in any TV channel.
I see your photo in the newspaper too.
Why is it happening to me?
I just can't understand.
I thought of telling you.
This is my number.
Call me if you've understood anything.
Hello...
I see him everywhere.
This is my number.
Why did you take so long to pick me up?
Tires are filled up, right?
I've used lorry tires, let's go.
Let's go fast.
What do you want to ask me?
I'll come to the point straight.
She is the one I'm going to marry.
My father's great great grandfather and
her father's great great grandfather
were childhood friends.
To keep their friendship last long,
they had entered into an agreement.
According to that,
If a boy or a girl is born in my clan
and if a boy or a girl is born in her clan,
they agreed to perform their marriage.
Fate is so strange.
In both our families,
it was either boys or girls in both
our clans since then.
For the first time,
to my father's great great
grandfather's wish, myself, a boy,
and to her father's great great grandfather's
wish, she Poonkodi, a girl too was born,
and our wedding is to be held soon.
It's their decision.
I think you haven't understood what I said.
My father's great great grand father's wish...
Shall we drink?
you said something.
But I think I heard it wrong.
- I said "shall we have drinks? ""
- Understood?
Tell me...
My father's great great...
your father's great great grandfather &
her father's great great grandfather
had an agreement.
According to that,
If a boy or a girl is born in your clan
and if a boy or a girl is born in her clan,
they agreed to perform get them married.
Fate is so strange.
It was either boys or girls in both
our families till now.
So, there were no marriages.
For the first time,
for your father's great great
grandfather's wish, myself, a boy,
and for her father's great great grandfather's
wish, this girl was born,
and the marriage agreed by the old men....
What's in your mind?
Tell me you, Madagascar.
My father's great great grandfather...
Excuse me.
I attained puberty at the age of 15.
Now I'm 21 years old.
- 16, 17...
- it's been 6 years since then, Mango.
Mango?
5 boys used to follow me everyday.
2 of them used to give me love letters.
Uncountable, you idiot!
That includes many foreigners.
I fell to none of them.
your intoxicating eyes,
your innocent looking face,
your style of talking,
your unshaven chins,
your slim body,
your dance, your fight.
Looking all these features in you,
I fell for you.
Stupid.
According to our plan,
I made Jahnavi fall in love with me.
What next?
Very good.
you're on the right track.
Good. Go ahead.
Happy married life.
Wish you all the very best.
- Congrats.
- Thank you.
- Congrats.
- Happy married life.
Thank you.
When are we getting married?
- Where are we going to our honeymoon?
- I'll tell after reaching there.
- Bye.
- Bye.
First my dad must agree.
Okay. I will meet him.
That's not so easy.
Only he knows where he will be.
Very big business man.
Boss, it's JD.
Brother, it's JD.
Hi Shan, my dear friend.
- How are you?
- Good.
- How have you been, JD?
- Long time. No see, any news.
Don't you know who killed Raka?
We have no business rivals in India.
But if police had nabbed Raka,
we would've been in danger.
So, whoever had killed Raka
has done us a favor.
But I still don't know who and
why he killed Raka.
I know.
There were 3, 1 is dead.
We are the remaining 2.
If one dies, only one remains.
I will kill him right now...
Sorry my friend.
I'm really sorry.
I got angry when I learnt that
you had killed Raka.
By infiltrating my gang with your spy,
it's confirmed that it's not you.
I've also proved that it's not me either.
So, a third person has killed Raka.
Sorry JD.
- Sorry to have spied on you.
- oh! Come on.
No formalities between friends.
It's okay.
- What do you say gentlemen?
- Correct.
Instead of finding a suitable replacement for
Raka and do business in India,
why should we fight among ourselves?
Our 25 year old arms & drugs network
shouldn't go close down in a day.
Right.
A gift to my friend and 25 year old friendship.
Thank you Shan.
But you know something.
I don't take freebies.
My gift to you as a token of friendship...
For giving me the wrong information.
- Thank you my friend.
- it's okay, Bye.
A spy in his gang without our knowledge?
If he could spy on us,
won't it be bad if we don't spy on him?
So, I killed his own man.
Dead men tell no tales.
- Hi dad! How are you?
- Fine. How are you?
- Dad, I miss you.
- I miss you too.
you seem to be very excited.
Any boy friend?
Hi! cool dad.
That's your dad.
- Can I speak to that lucky boy?
- Sure. one second.
Talk to him.
- Hello uncle.
- Hello.
Congrats! young man.
Come to Munich.
Stop.
Dad is always security conscious.
- Welcome home, my darling.
- Dad.
- Hi dad.
- How are you?
I'm fine.
- Dad, this is Pugal.
- Pugal.
Hi uncle.
Hi! Nice name.
Thanks.
Dad, keep chatting.
- I'll be there in 5 minutes.
- yeah...
Please.
100 million dollar empire.
One & only heir, my daughter Jahnavi.
Should I get her married to you?
No chance.
you must be kidding.
I'm not a fool to give you a blank cheque
to go away from my daughter.
JD. you're still alive because
you're my daughter's guest.
If not, my security guards would've...
Good.
The person might be the wrong one.
But your aim hit bullseye.
- Who checked him?
- Sir.
He wore sword as a belt.
you let him in.
I don't want this to happen ever again.
yeah...
What was I saying...?
you hit the bullseye.
How Qualified are you to marry my daughter?
I did M.Tech in IIT Kharagpur
and MBA in oxford university.
you are a smuggler.
I'm a professional killer.
you saw me now, didn't you?
What more do you want to qualify?
But still I'll tell you because you're going
to be my future father-in-law.
I killed your best friend Raka.
Is it enough or you want more?
I know you killed him for money.
Tell me who hired you to kill Raka.
I'm an assassin not a traitor.
None has left this place alive
without answering my question.
Now, I will.
I like your guts.
I want to talk to you in person.
What next?
Go to Hotel China Gate next.
My parents aren't at home.

Shall we have fun, darling?
No need of play ground or umpire.
None will lose, handsome.

it's an indoor game.
it's a shame if you
don't know to play.
you're a fool if you don't break
the rules of the game.
Goal of the game is to
cross the limits.
My parents aren't at home.
And no one to stop us.
Shall we have fun, darling?
The taxi I boarded always paid
extra tip above the fare to me.
I asked for a seat in the bus.
The driver gave his seat to me.
you've a great body
with loads of pleasure in it.
you've a great body
with loads of pleasure in it.
Come tonight, we have fun.
My parents aren't at home.
And no one to stop us.
Shall we have fun, darling?
A diamond merchant looked
at my sparkling teeth
He threw away real diamonds as fake.
A gold merchant saw my golden body
He gave up his bullion stock for me.
A beautiful young girl
gave me a shock of the life.
A beautiful young girl

I'm the king of your kingdom of beauty.
My parents aren't at home.
And no one to stop us.

Are you okay?
Sorry.
Do you know who I am?
- Do you know who you are up against?
- I'll show you who I am.
Show me.
Don't shoot.
Everything here is explosive.
Thank you
What?
you listened to what I said, didn't you?
Find out who he is & his whereabouts.
Today, he is dead meat.
I'm scared to even look at his photo.
I'm Pugal.
I'm not at home right now.
you can leave a message
after the beep. Bye.
Calling from Citibank.
We are interested in giving you...
If you are accepting...
Pugal, it's me, your mom.
I'm coming there on Wednesday
morning by Lufthansa flight.
Receive me at the airport.
Only 30 minutes more.
Come on, let's go.
Over there.
Come on.
Come on shoot.
Shoot.
Shoot.
My mom is here.
Shoot him.
- No.
- Uncle. What happened?
Stupid.
She is my wife.
Hey come here.
Make it fast.
Where did you get so much money?
I joined army & sacrificed
a lot for the country.
But I got nothing.
I did a very small favor to our enemy.
They rewarded me with lot of money.
How can saviors turn into traitors?
Talking like a true patriot...?
I will not only sell the country
but also you, for money.
Money is important to me.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
If you sacrifice your life
for our country,
I will feel proud to be
a soldier's widow.
I can't live a life as a traitor's wife.
I feel very happy to see
you after so many years.
I think we're united by fate.
yes, fate brought me here.
Not to see you.
But to see my son.
Haven't you changed, Shanti?
Try to understand.
Whatever I did was for you.
Now, I am a millionaire.
I can buy anything I wish.
Buy a wife & a child for you
with that money.
Please.
Forget the past & forgive me.
Traitor can never be forgiven.
Get lost.
Shanti...
Mother hasn't forgotten the past.
I need sometime to set things right.
Thank God, you understood my plight.
I was yearning to see you
for the past 20 years.
Me too.
you're great, my son.
Hello everybody.
Sir, what's the problem?
What happened sir?
Attention everybody.
This is the control room calling.
An African chimpanzee has
escaped from the zoo.
He will look & speak
just like a human.
Please arrest it the moment
you encounter it. Over.
Okay. Message received.
Over.
Okay. I am keeping a watch.
Tell me the moment you see it.
Okay.
I spotted the monkey.
Keep a watch on it.
Don't let it escape.
Send a force soon.
It looks dangerous.
Come fast.
Why catch me?
Both photos are matching perfectly.
Take lip prints.
200% matching.
Take it to the zoo.
Sir, I'm not African monkey.
I'm a poor soul.
- I'm a normal man from India.
- Indian...?
- yes...Indian.
- Bollywood?
- Yes, Hollywood.
- No Hollywood.
Do you know Bollywood dance?
- yes.
- Show. We will let you go.
Stop killing me with your
sexy sharp eyes.
Stop pushing with your thin waistline.
Next.
Cow dies. Man ate it.
Make a drum with its skin & beat it.
Cow dies. Man ate it.
Make a drum with its skin & beat it.
Beat it, man.
They are busy dancing.
you escape.
- it's okay.
- Sorry.
No problem.
Maada...!?
Did police torture you here?
Stop crying.
I saved you from the police.
Why did you come here?
My brother ran away from home
when he was very young.
I heard that he lives here.
I came here to find him.
I won't go back unless I find him.
All the best.
What happened to your hair?
When I was about to board the plane,
people caught me & cut my hair because
it was hitting the roof of the plane.
Okay.
Don't worry Maada.
I will make you stay in my friend's
house and look after you.
Thank you, Jahnavi.
One second.
- Hello.
- A happy news.
What's it?
I've found my father.
My father & your father are
very good friends.
Wow! Great!
Ladies & Gentlemen.
And my dear friends.
Today is the happiest day in my life.
I'll introduce you to a VIP of my life.
My son, Pugal.
Hi uncle.
We are always friends.
you're right.
Have you met my son before?
Before you knew him as your son,
- I knew him as my son-in-law.
- is it? Fabulous!
Wow!
Good.
From partners, we've become kinsmen.
With this coalition, we are the No.1.
Let's celebrate.
- Come on babes.
- Wow!
let's go.
if you're angry,
I will be angry too.
if you don't look at me,
I won't either.
if you yell at me,
I will yell at you too.
if you fight with me,
I will fight with you too.
if you stop talking to me,
I will stop talking to you too.
But if you forget me,
I will die.
Even if you don 't listen to me,
I will shout loud to say
that I love you.
Even if you don 't stop by me,
I will chase you down to
say that I love you.
I'll never lie that whatever
you say is poetry.
I'll never call you a world beauty.
I'll never peep through the hole
while you're in the shower.
I'll never ask for anything you ate.
I'll never look at your gestures.
I'll never look at you
even in my dreams.
I'll never come after you.
But if you forget me,
I will die.
Even if you don't listen to me,
I will shout loud to say
that I love you.
Even if you don 't stop by me,
I will chase you down to say
that I love you.
I'll make your dimple swell
with my kisses.
I'll plant my hair in my mustache
on your bosom.
I'll give you a piggy back
ride to sleep.
I'll keep an alarm that will ring silently
like a blooming flower.
I'll romance even on Sundays.
I'll put an end to your shyness.
I'll bear all the pain you give.
But if you forget me,
I will die.
Even if you don 't listen to me,
I will shout loud to say
that I love you.
Even if you don 't stop by me,
I will chase you down to
say that I love you.
I just can't stop loving you.
Who is that?
Damn it.
Urinating in public even in foreign.
I just can't...
Cow beggar.
Mummy..?!?!?!
Bloody beggar.
How dare you!
Shan.
No.
Wow!
Nobody knows about this place.
That includes my closest partner Max too.
Till now, it was my secret place.
From now, it is yours too.
I must tell you everything.
you're my heir.
you're my everything.
I'm bit excited.
Come...
This case has a bluray disc.
It contains complete information about JD.
Like in tales a demon's life is in parrot.
This disc holds the key to JD's life.
Likewise, he holds the key to our life.
I mean he has complete information
about us in a CD.
After marrying JD's daughter,
you will get that CD too.
With those 2 discs,
we will be the Emperors of this network.
I feel I'm on the top of the world.
I'm very happy today.
I've handed over everything to you.
Now, I can rest in peace.
Don't worry.
I will give you permanently rest.
Hi Jahnavi...
- Where are you?
- on the top..
I've been trying to reach you for long time.
you promised to come with me
to my friend's birthday party.
Have you forgotten it?
When will you come?
- I'll be there within 2 minutes.
- How will you come?
Will you come flying?
- Wow!
- I love you...
He is our young commander.
Come on, let's be merry.
Come on, let's be merry.
your eyes will gleam in excitement.
I'm losing myself this moment.
The merry making should
electrify our impulses.
young blood is rushing and
gushing in excitement.
My song will rant the sky.
Come on, sing with me.
My dance shakes up the earth.
you got to believe me.
Come on, let's be merry.
Come on, let's be merry.
I've seen many girls.
Admired their eyes too.
Till now, no one has won my heart.
I saw you and your pride.
you've strung this bow
without touching it.
you wooed me with
your bewitching glances.
I was left with no options.
you have violently won me
with your captivating smile.
for God's sake,
please spare me now.
Come on, let's be merry.
Come on, let's be merry.
Were you born in Greece?
Were you brought up in Swiss?
is Paris the address of
your enchanting smile?
your front is class.
your back is mass.
or else, are you a mixture of both?
Hey, you're slowly throwing the net
and trying to trap me.
Come near me and hug me tightly.
Play all your mischievous pranks on me.
Come on, let's be merry.
Come on, let's be merry.
I don't know how it happened.
We have informed.
His son is on the way.
your father expired in the air crash.
We couldn't recover his body.
Father...
We never expected this.
Don't control your tears.
Cry out loud...
Pugal, why are you looking at the glass?
Do you know whose cooling glass is this?
JD killed my brother.
We shouldn't spare JD.
He is not an ordinary man.
We must plan and kill him.
I'll tell you the plan.
Be careful,
'Villu' is a dangerous man.
Well done...well done, Pugal.
But why did you kill
your father for our deal?
I'm sorry.
Shan isn't my father.
What are you saying?
A fraud like him can't be my father.
I just acted as his son.
That's it.
That's a good one.
But how did you make shan
believe that you're his son?
Simple!
Through his wife!
Their son went missing as a kid.
I impersonated as their long lost son.
I easily trapped the lady yearning
for long lost son with sentiment.
Superb!
your bluray disc and secrets
are locked in a Swiss bank.
This is the pin number.
Great job!
Let me see it.
Pin number is correct, boss.
Good work, Pugal.
What next?
Saying I'm going to kill you,
I'm going to bring all his men here
and eliminate them.
Wow! It sounds good!
How will you accomplish it?
Somethings are better seen than heard.
See me in action.
- Did you send the CD?
- yes, boss.
It'll start a internecine war and
leave all of them dead.
But why did you kill
your father for our deal?
I'm sorry.
Shan isn't my father.
What are you saying?
I just acted as his son.
That's it.
I'm going to bring all his men here
and eliminate them.
Let's all go inside.
Let's lay siege JD's place and
kill him in his own den.
you enter first.
Give us a signal.
We'll come in.
Correct?
Correct...correct!
you go first.
Finish!
Pugal, JD has sent the CD about
your conversation with him.
you killed my brother and gave a great
performance of mourning his death too.
It was unbearable!
He cried more than us. We must...
Am I a fool?
Hey, who are you?
Why did you do all this?
What's your connection with JD?
Why did you kill my brother shan?
Tell me.
I'll give you 10 seconds.
If you decide to kill,
go ahead and do it.
Don't spend time to inquire.
Bloody fools!
By now, Pugal would be dead.
Go to Swiss bank and
get the bluray disc.
It's not a bomb, it's a wedge.
How was my stick?
Is it good?
It was specially made for you.
God is omnipresent.
In Swiss bank locker too.
I just did it for fun.
- What?
- I just did it for fun...
Have fun with uncles & brothers-in-law,
not with your son-in-law!
Father-in-law, any video coverage?
Smile please.
Smile please.
That is...
I want to meet your daughter.
I've blown up all the vehicles.
Don't mind, I'll take your vehicle.
Janu will get angry, if I go late.
Walk your way to home.
Bye!
you go.
I'm an ace archer.
I'm the one who stringed your bow.
I'll kiss you.
your pulse will race.
it will compete with 100 horses.
I'll hug you,
you will swoon in joy.
you will run amok like a mad elephant.
I'm greater than Lord Krishna.
I'm a master of romance.
I'm Cupid's buddy.
I'm greater than celestial Menaka.
I'll teach you love tricks.
I'm the head priestess of love.
I'm an ace archer.
your cheeks are alluring.
it's delicious and mouth watering.
your sultry body is like treasure trove,
I want to steal it.
you have sharp eyes.
it's watching me all the time.
you've eliminated shyness from me.
I'm greater than Lord Krishna.
I'm a master of romance.
I'm Cupid's buddy.
I'm greater than celestial Menaka.
I'll teach you love tricks.
I'm the head priestess of love.
I'm an ace archer.
I'm the one who stringed your bow.
like tender coconuts in Sahara.
like fire in Cheerapunji.
I'll quench your thirst
anytime, anywhere.
like water in Pluto,
you're hidden deep down in my heart.
oh come on, dude...
Come on, I'll make your night delightful.
Come on, you tomboyish girl.
Come and enjoy the bliss of heaven.
I'm greater than Lord Krishna.

I'm greater than celestial Menaka.
I'll teach you love tricks.
I'm the head priestess of love.
I'm an ace archer.
I'm the one who stringed your bow.
Check it out... check it out.
Get up... get up.
Now let's get it out.
let's sing and dance.
let's go.
Hey, Raka..
My man Pugal has couriered me
the secret bluray disc.
Watch now what I'll do to you with it.
Hello...I'm Joseph.
Raka speaking.
Where is my bluray disc?
Why are you astonished?
What else can a man do if he's
shaken up from deep sleep?
Where is the disc?
It's with me, why?
you liar!
Why did you send the disc to India?
I must reach India safely, right?
Okay, cool...tell me now.
What's the price of the disc?
JD, I'm a professional killer,
but still I killed your partner Shan
and his family for your sake,
why did I do it?
Trusting you'll honor the deal
of giving your daughter to me.
But you played a double game
and tried to eliminate me.
I can kill you right now also.
Impossible! Killing me is like
committing suicide for you.
We are like lovers, father-in-law!
We can't live without the other.
The disc will reach the police safely
if I get even a small scratch.
If you want the disc,
get your daughter Jahnavi married to me.
Normally In-laws give dowry
to the son-in-law,
for a change I'll give your
bluray disc as dowry to you.
Dear, how is that?!
I'm in this business before you were born,
trying to act smart with me?
you needn't give me the disc,
boys, bring him to India.
I'll get the disc from you
in your own country.
What's it dear?
What happened?
Pugal isn't your son,
he impersonated to kill your husband.
He's a professional killer.
I know Pugal isn't my son.
He didn't kill my husband,
he sentenced a traitor with death.
Do you know about his family?
Do you know who his father was?
Saravanan!
He's a patriotic Tamil
who loves his motherland.
He's a Great Warrior standing tall.
All the directions know his Greatness.
A terror to the traitors.
A man who knows no fear.
A warrior out to save motherland.
A warrior who fights evil staking his life.
A warrior who never spares the enemy.
A thorough bred Tamil.
Sir!
yes Major, well done.
- it was a fantastic job.
- Thank you sir.
- I did my duty.
- Please!
Terrorists waylaid and looted
an army shipment of weapons.
We must find them.
I'm giving you the charge
of this operation, Major.
I'll finish off everything sir.
I've called a meeting to
discuss tomorrow's operation.
Go ahead.
A small hitch in the plan.
What is it?
I've got information about a young Tamil officer
is in charge of the operation.
- Name?
- it's official secret.
Deal may hit a block.
Can we make money
without facing difficulty?
Think over it, a billion!
250 millions for each!
We sacrificed so much for this nation,
what did we get in return?
A rum bottle and Rs.5 only!
That's all!
Last assignment, we had killed many,
Just one more murder for our sake,
life is settled.
- Well said partner.
- Cheers!
Comb gently.
Serving country and home too!
Brother, it happens in every home,
please take your seat.
Thank you.
- Chocolate!
- you have it uncle, I want a gun.
I thought he'll be like mother,
but he's like his father.
He's Major Saravanan's son,
like father like son.
I'll buy a gun next time,
I'm going to Malaysia regarding a case.
It may take a month.
- Who is the 'case'?
- No jokes please, it's an Interpol case.
Breakfast is ready, come.
- Come, let's have it.
- okay.
Come...do it fast!
Shall we call men? come fast.
Go...go...
Major...please forgive us...
we'll surrender.
Please show mercy.
We are also Tamils.
We'll not do this again.
Spare us...we'll not do this again.
Please Major!
He's a patriotic Tamil
who loves his motherland.
He's a Great Warrior standing tall.
All the directions know his Greatness.
A terror to the traitors.
A man who knows no fear.
A warrior out to save motherland.
A warrior who fights evil staking his life.
A warrior who never spares the enemy.
He's an attacking hurricane.
Poor young man!
Young blood!
Hail Mother India!
When we were shipping our
regiment's weapons to the border,
suddenly a man entered with gun
and tried to steal the weapons
We aimed our guns at him and
asked him to surrender.
He fired at us and we lost few officers.
We returned fire as self defense.
We just did our duty sir.
Later we came to know he was Indian
army's senior officer Major Saravanan.
It was a black day sir.
We feel disgusted to see a traitor
from our Tamil Nadu.
It's been proved beyond doubt that
Saravanan was involved in arms theft.
Court orders to strip him off
his military honors.
He's not a traitor!
Please don't strip him!
I'll not allow you to do it.
I'll not allow you to do it.
Mother!
Don't accuse him, he's not a traitor.
He would've certainly sacrificed his life
for the country, please trust me.
We mustn't allow it...He betrayed the
country and spoiled our reputation.
We'll not allow the cremation
of a traitor in this holy land.
Get the body.
No...no...
Leave him...don't do it...
Throw away the body.
Please don't do it.
Please leave him.
- Dear!
- Leave my father.
Father...father...
Father...father...
Come with me,
live peacefully elsewhere.
How can he live without you?
If he lives here, the society will kill
him calling as a traitor's son.
Take him away from here.
- No, I'll not go mother.
- No son, please listen to me.
Please don't cry.
Look at me son,
you'll listen to me, won't you?
Don't cry.
Mother...mother...
Sorry, I misunderstood Pugal.
Thanks at last you've understood my son.
What to do now?
My father is taking Pugal
to India at gunpoint.
your father is not taking
my son to India,
in fact my son is taking
your father to India.
His every action has a meaning.
When he decides, it'll be done.
He'll do it.
Fantastic job, partner,
kill him and get the disc.
Hey, kill both of them and get the disc.
I don't need you also anymore.
Mother, I'll not go,
I'll not leave you.
Mother!
Please forgive me son.
I've never been a good mother to you.
Don't feel like that mother,
I'm living for you only.
The humiliation you went through will end today
and my vow will also be fulfilled.
Come and see what I've brought for you.
Banish her from this village...
- Leave me.
- Mother...
She mustn't show her face to anyone.
Only then she'll be
a living lesson to others.
Leave me...leave me...
No!
Traitor's wife!
My mother!
Go man.
Leave me.
- Leave him...don't harm him.
- Get lost.
Dig a ditch.
I killed and buried his father.
I'll bury and then kill him.
My son...my son...
Save my son!
Pugal, don't spare him!
No...no...
No...
A man who knows no fear.
He engulfs like lava.
He's a fearless Tamil warrior.
Death fears to touch this young warrior...
Tell him to spare me.
Tell him to spare my life.
He's motherland's favorite son.
He destroys enemies.
Tell the truth about my father.
I'll tell.
Will you spare me if I tell the truth?
His father Maj.Saravanan was
an honest army officer.
We killed him unjustly and
branded him as a traitor.
Please forgive me.
Forgive me.
I've told the truth.
Pugal, please leave me.
I've told the truth.
- You promised to spare me, right?
- I'll leave...
