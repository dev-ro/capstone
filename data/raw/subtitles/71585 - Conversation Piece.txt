Exquisite
No doubt about that
Yes, yes, indeed
Forgive me. Excuse me, let me...
Oh, it's quite unecessary.
Actually I'd like to take a look at the verandah
Please do. I'm afraid it's a bit untidy
Oh! Don't bother. I can manage
Well, Professor?
Well it's exquisite as I've already said, but...
I can't buy it
The price is not unreasonable
Last Spring at Sothebys, you paid
3000 pounds. Not a penny more
Now, Professor. I put in a bid myself for 3500
Show you the better sale...
Oh really Professor, that's quite unnecessary
Though I am surprised
Oongratulations, in any case
Still you must admit that prices have
risen considerably since last Spring?
Only yesterday we had a request for
Anybody here? Is anybody here?
May I ask a favour of you?
Yes, of course
We'll leave it, you'll think it over
I've thought it over
I'm not bickering about the price.
It's the wrong time of the year anyway
Taxes, work to be done on the house...
Take it away
I don't want the responsibility
It shouldn't be weighing on you that much
Don't worry, you'll be doing us a favour
We have to look at some things in
the Villa off the Via Oasia
We'd want to leave it in the car and nowadays...
We'll send for it later
If you don't I'll send it back myself.
I'm not in the market gentlemen
I'm still hoping that you'll change your mind
Not to worry Professor, we know the way,
I only hope we haven't disturbed you
- Not at all. Have a good trip
- Thankyou goodbye
You really should have this one
- I don't change my mind. Goodbye
- Goodbye
Have they gone?
Yes, just this moment
Good
Excuse me, ah, are you the ah?
The owner of this painting?
That? Good God no! Are you sure it's
won'th all that money?
- A frightfully oily pair those two.
They're not fencers...
- Fencers? - Are they?
But they are the proprietors of
the Blanchart gallery Paris.
But, werert you with them?
Oh no, I bumped into them on the landing
Then to what do I owe this pleasure?
Your housekeeper and the porter told
me that the upstairs apartment is empty.
I would like to rent it
Rent it?
It's not for rent
I'm moving part of my library up there.
I have no more room here
Now, Professor, really?
I've looked, the corridors, the service area...
an enormous amount of shelf space. And mind you,
if you had simpler shelves in your study there'd
be no more problem
Thankyou for your advice but if you don't mind...
Listen, Professor. My husband who has never
read a book in his life, unless I am very much mistaken
has a mania for rooms lined with books.
Insanity if you ask me
Well, he's had some other shelves made,
not metal ones, I agree they're ghastly, but
a wood, cherry wood, you have
no idea the amount they hold
I like the shelves I have and
the apartment is not for rent
- Now if you'll excuse me...
- At least let me see it...
- See what?
- The apartment. I may not even like
it and that would settle everything
It will only take a second, and you needrt budge,
your housekeeper can show it to me
Elmenia, I think she said her name
was... isn't that it?
Elmenia!
She told me she's been with you for 25 years.
You're a lucky man
Elmenia! Elmenia!
- The Professor has kindly given his consent...
- Elmenia bring me the keys to the upstairs apartment
- the upstairs, yes
I don't wish to be rude but I
must repeat this is a waste of time
Yes, of course,
but couldn't I have a little peek?
For years I've been looking at those
windows up there
I often park in Piazza Oapotelli when
I come downtown on errands
Parking has become such a problem.
That is another reason why I am trying
to get a flat in this neighbourhood,
I live 15 miles out you know
Well?
- My daughter Laeita
- Hi
By the way, excuse me I am Bianca Brumonti
- Your coat Sir
- What have you been doing here all this time?
There's no heat up there
That's alright. Very difficult situation
Oooh. What's that?
You know it's really nice up here
- Look
- Remind me to ask Stefano if he knows the
owner of the Blanchart gallery
- They look like crooks to me
- La Oarlate Blanchard? They're
famous like Ohristies or Sotheby's
Oh! But that doesn't mean they wouldn't rob you blind
I won't open the windows because they're barred
Laetia!
Besides, as I've already said I am in a great hurry
Laetia! Lend me a hand
- Really Senora, I must ask you to...
- I'll shut it again, don't worry.
It's just to get an idea
Anyway, it's so musty in here!
It's beautiful, absolutely perfect!
Bianca you're a genius
It's perfect!
Alright, calm yourself. He's not renting to us
- What do you mean?
- It's probably being kept for mice or bats
He just wants more money
That is not the case!
Mumma. Oome here, look!
If it's for rent, what's the problem?
From the very beginning I informed your
mother that this apartment was not for rent
your mother insisted upon seeing it
He's no son of mine, thank God!
They say he looks like his father
But it's only a coincidence
Hey Bianca! You better get your arse
down here real fast
Thejoke may be on you!
What's Oonrad doing here?
Excuse me
I can't see him
I saw him. Why is he standing down there?
I don't know
He said he couldn't come with me
because he was meeting you
Why meeting me?
Stefano, I distinctly heard him
tell you he was coming by to pick you up
Oh, I must of got it mixed up or something
I really don't remember
I said I would do that! Didrt I?
- You'll only get yourself all dirty
- Wait we have to put on the bar
The police are towing away your car
You couldn't stop them?
I've never been permitted to
have the keys of your car my dear
It's infuriating
- Arert you going to show me my little nest?
- Don't be funny
Laetia, Stefano, if they've already hauled
it away try and catch them in your car
- Alright, come on
- Yeah
Senorina? Is Miseur Blanchard there?
Yes, yes. It's I
Blachard! Is my Ooncierge still there?
The man who brought back the painting.
Well that's too bad.
I say too bad because now you'll have to take
the trouble of sending someone back here
I've changed my mind, I've decided to buy it
Sold it? I don't believe it, when?
Professor, Senor Michaeli
Oome in Michaeli, come in
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, no, no. Oome in, come in, sit down
Why are you standing there?
Oh, yes...
Yesterday morning I had a phone
call from the Bianca Brumonti, whom you know
- I've met, but I don't know her
- nor do I wish to be...
- Yes, I understand
- I hope she's not the reason you've come all this way?
- No, I
Here we come ready or not!
Were you talking about somebody's mother?
If you don't say you're pleased
I'll have a coronary.
- We bought it. Where shall I put it?
- These people with you?
- We won him over
As I was saying Professor,
yesterday I received a certain telephone
call with a proposal of considerable
A proposal?
Yes and as your lawyer
I felt it was my duty to listen to an
advantageous offer and also to advise you to
Michaeli what are you trying to tell me?
We forced him into it.
Listen Professor I know how you feel and I
know how Mummy can be but I beg
you to listen to me for a minute.
Just one year, one year?
I swear if you knew what it meant to us you
would probably give us the apartment free
I believe Professor that Senora Brumonti
tried to explain to you yesterday,
that she wants the
apartment only for one year.
You told me that you don't plan the renovation
for the new library before this next Spring!
- And so that's why I took the liberty of
- No, no I'm sorry
Rome is full of the kind of fancy
apartments that will suit you.
But Mummy will invent a thousand
excuses not to go and look at them
From what the Marcasa told me it seems
the young lady here is engaged to the ah...
Oh, that's silly, we're only trying it out.
Anyway, Mummy's agreed I can leave home
and live in Oonrad's house with Stefano.
And who's Oonrad?
Oome on Professor you met him yesterday,
the apartment's his, I mean it's for him
You're an extraordinarily frank young lady.
I will answer you with equal frankness.
I am in no hurry to move my
library upstairs and I am an old man.
Erratic. Slightly hysterical.
Often disturbed by strange
noises and strange people.
And having to put up with
any sort of formalities...
So now you see why I
cannot rent you the apartment.
Oh, you're not old and you're not hysterical.
You're a fascinating person and you know it.
You're a tiny bit mad, granted.
But so is anyone who is at all interesting.
And you're a bit
mad about this too aren't you?
Now don't tell me you don't like it anymore.
- Didrt he call Blachard while we were still there?
- That's right I forgot.
Mummy was right. Blachard's a crook.
He sold us the painting for much
less than he was asking you
You shouldn't have told him!
Why not? The professor should
know how unethical they are.
They knew he collected this kind of paintings
and they were trying to take advantage.
We're even Professor, that is for
three months rent? Paid in advance.
Now then Professor, shall we make these
young people happy? A one year contract.
Oh my God!
Stop! What are you doing?
Stop! Help! My God!
Are you crazy? You're breaking the ceiling!
What are you doing? Good God.
Domenico, Domenico! Answer me!
Oh Professor, at last.
- Good evening Elmenia
- Ah. Good evening.
- What's happened here?
- Did you see?
You wouldn't believe what's been happening.
Oh my God, and this is nothing.
You should see the kitchen.
They broke the ceiling in Professor. It's a good
thing you were out, I couldn't prepare your supper.
It's all wet!
It's not nearly as bad as some
other walls in the house.
I've never seen such madness!
As if there was a war on.
It seemed as though the
house was being blown to bits.
I went upstairs to complain and they
even refused to hear what I had to say.
And they slammed the door on me as well.
I wanted to call the police, but Domenico said
wait for you, because you would handle the matter.
Stop chattering!
Bring me the keys to the upstairs
apartment, and get the flashlight!
Yes, yes
What have they done?
Oall Michaeli
Who's there?
Is that you Mario?
My house is filled with rubble.
Water is seeping in everywhere.
And now that I've seen all this
I'm amazed the building is still standing!
This is madness! Infuriating!
So is your presence here,
you come in like a thief!
You might have been shot
I'm glad I'm still alive. If only to hear an
explanation of all this destruction!
I'll do what I want with my place. They told
me that you had allowed work to begin,
even though the contract hasn't been finalised.
One bathroom. The improvement of
one bathroom is all the lease allows.
Which lease, under the circumstances
I have no intention of signing.
Where as I have every intention
of signing a claim for damages.
Excuse me, I was also told a lease is only a piece
of paper to be shown to certain people if necessary.
But the contract is to be put in my name.
Your name?
The large advance you were given is evidence
enough that the house has been sold.
It's a simple one year lease!
Not renewable don't you understand?
- Oan I make a phonecall?
- Phonecall?
Would you mind if I ask you to clear up this
matter with Madam Brumonti? In my presence?
By all means, there is no possibility that
Madam Brumonti can assert the contrary.
- Have we heard from Senor Michaeli?
- Yes I telephoned but he wasrt in yet,
but I left the word to call back
immediately as soon as he gets in
I see
Oould I have a glass of whisky?
Straight please
- There's no liquor in the house
- Not even...? Oharl! Madam Brumonti entre?
Yeah, soon, bye.
Ah, I do it all the time, call the
house in London instead of Paris.
You can add these calls to the damages.
Don't you really have any whisky?
Or don't you want to give me any?
- There's wine, if you like
- Why I'm glad you're not a teetotaller
- A glass of red wine please
- Yes, Sir
Hello?
Ah, hi, it's you! You're a lying cunt.
Explain this latest bullshit and don't
fuck with me, you'll only make it worse.
What are you talking about? What bullshit?
The apartment bullshit sweetheart!
The apartment bullshit!
Would you stop shouting
and clarify that?
I'll clarify it, or rather,
I'll have someone else clarify it.
Oh don't play games with me Conrad.
Conrad you ungrateful son of bitch...
answer me goddamn you!
Senora, this is the Professor
Will you please get off the line?
Let me speak a moment please
I want to speak with that bastard. Son of a bitch
Hello!
Will you get off the phone?
Senora please!
I am tired of all these lies!
I do not say things that are not true, is that clear?
Yes,
As for the rest you may speak with my attorney
Goddammit, for heavers sake, Professor.
Listen to me now. Please, be
reasonable, I can explain everything.
I will explain everything to you.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's been a misunderstanding, Professor
Shame I won't get to hear the explanation,
you thought I would be good for another year
Well you thought wrong, as of now it's all over!
Madam la ma chies, la merde! Ount!
Is it alright?
Horrible, thanks
Goodnight Elmenia
Well, that's done
I don't like to interfere in things
that don't concern me
- Besides, I don't quite understand...
- You understand
The richer they are, the lousier, cheap!
Oheap inside, you know what I mean?
Good God! What the hell has happened here?
This is nothing. You should
see the rest of the apartment
Stick it to them good, make
them pay millions! Millions!
When did this recording come out?
That's a new Mozart edition,
sent to me from New York.
Bernstein will be here this Summer,
conducting the complete series for Rie
I have the Bern recording. Do you mind?
I somehow never go to concerts
myself. Prefer records
That's better
I love that aria
I have to make a phone call, sorry
I was expecting a friend upstairs and...
It's Oonrad, who's there? Seen Maro?
No tell him not to come, I may drop by later
Okay
I'll just be a minute
Jane?
Who the hell do you think it is?
Listen, is St Moritz still on for tomorrow?
Well make up your mind,
if you're going, I am going.
Hell no, just me
Arthur Davis...
Not you, silly bitch. Listen,
I'll call you back later, okay? Bye.
That's by Davis? Isn't it?
Arthur Davis
Surely by an English painter in the 18th Oentury
Some friends of mine have a painting
in their house by Arthur Davis.
A portrait with a landscape,
I looked at it carefully.
That's interesting.
In that painting, in the centre,
not to one side like this
there's the exact same pavilion
This painting dates from about 1750
If you like, I'll bring you the photograph
Are you interested in paintings?
No, not really, but I've had the
chance to study that one carefully
It hangs near the phone
Who's there? Machello?
Any of my people there?
Who else?
If it's close
What's up?
Oh no, I've been screwed
enough for one night.
I'll tell you tomorrow, bye
Strange house, I don't like it, but it fascinates me
Please don't get up, I know the way
It's a shame things end like this
I would've liked to come down
and have a chat now and then
- Goodnight Professor
- Goodnight
If you want some peace it would
be a good idea to unplug the phone
Madam Brumonti will call again when she
should have left and she'll break your balls
I don't want to talk with your lawyer!
Those matters don't interest me!
You're right and that's that!
You surely think I didn't rush
down here from Paris on a night flight
crowded with Arabs to tell you that
they did wrong to knock down a wall!
A wall! You call this a wall?!
My dear Professor, you behaved unspeakably
If I had my own personal
reasons for giving someone
my version of our contract,
you had no right to interfere!
But since you have done so, I have every
reason to believe you had some purpose in mind
Perhaps you want to protect the
interests of Earl Huble instead of mine?
I don't know what you're saying,
I'm not protecting anyone's interest!
And certainly not those of a Huble,
who I don't even know!
You don't ha? Well then I'll tell you.
He's my kept boy. Paid lover. Alright?
Do you also want to know
how much money I spend on him?
Oh! How awful to come to this
Mummy! When did you get here?
What's going on?
- Hi
- You bumbling little idiot!
Now you'll have to put
everything back the way it was
Look I only did what you told me
Everything as it was. That's that!
What's wrong, what did he say?
- Relax Mummy, for God's sake!
- Alright, shut up
Where's Oonrad?
I haven't seen him, last night we
dropped in at the 74, but it was late
Maro told me that Oonrad was thinking of going
to St Moritz for a few days, while you were in Paris
Didrt you tell him you were coming back?
No. I took the night flight, simply
horrible, they all looked liked hijackers!
Why the hurry?
Don't you know? The old idiot told him I hadrt
bought the apartment, now I'll actually have to buy it!
He's no idiot cause he'll never sell it to you
- Isn't that right professor?
- What advice can I possibly give you?
Your mother's hysterics don't concern me!
I'm not interested in people who
lose control of their own destiny
I won't express an opinion, that would be as,
as futile as the dramas you wish to involve me in!
I am simply not interested and that is that!
If as you say, our lawyers have
signed this wretched lease,
and if you promise to put back everything
just as it was at your own expense...
...you may keep the apartment
and if you don't want it anymore, just tell me
and I'll reimburse you for the painting
Right now
Ohoose for yourself and leave me in peace
Oh I know we made a mistake,
you seemed so understanding
You're mistaken
I promise you I won't bother you
again about our family problems
Now if you can just explain to
Stefano what has to be done upstairs,
Oh remember, we've already
agreed on one bathroom and I want it twice
as big as the one up there now
What's so funny?
It's just as though we
spoke two different languages
Why?
There's no possibility of us ever
understanding each other
And that's funny?
Tragic obviously. I guess I'm the one
that's lost contact, as they say
Let me show you, I've got the new
plans for the apartment Professor
The walls that I would like to strike
out are marked in yellow here
Which is the bathroom wall?
- Oan I use the telephone?
- Yes, in there
Oh no, that was part of the old design, this...
Is it out of order?
Oh! Did you know it was unplugged?
- What?
- The phone!
Yes, I forgot, last night
You see, and then you complain
of not having any contact
- I wasrt complaining in the least
- Still it surprises me
Hello Jane, how are you?
Thought I heard you were going to St Moritz
Who wanted a ride?
Jane! Where have you been?
The whole population of Western
Europe knows he's a born whore
Stefano! Oonrad didn't make it
- I hate him, I swear, I really hate him!
- Hate who?
Darling! Whose boudoir did you fall out of?
We looked all over for you!
Where did you end up last night?
Here, we were listening to some music
Here? Why didn't you tell me?
Did you know mother's back?
You had a fight didn't you?
No, no fight. Just told her we were through with it
She's just hysterical,
she caught the night flight.
I picked this up last night from those
friends of mine. See if I'm not right.
Interesting
We'll talk about this later
Very interesting
It's hard to tell from a photograph
It's notjust the landscape, it's more the technique
The trees aren't like the trees, ah sorry,
of other painters of the period
It's a very sharp observation
Did you, ah, study art history?
Only a little, I liked it
Why did you stop?
Those were the times, 68,
I threw myself into the
student movement, deeper than
most, got in trouble and had to run
God knows how I ended
up in the world I'm in now.
Well there's no doubt about it
Oongratulations
You know why I didn't think of it?
Because of all my paintings that one has
the most complete documentation. Oome.
Oonrad's here. I mean I was right,
I mean you didn't have a fight
What fight?
That's what I am telling you,
he didn't mention it.
Why the hell would he
mention anything to you?
Mummy, get some more rest
I told Mummy you werert mad so then she got mad.
Oh please, call her, go see her, do something
- I'm through with it!
- You just got through saying there was no fight
- I'm leaving her anyway
- You mean you've decided to blackmail her
It's tempting but I don't need it
You bastard
Be nice to her, for my sake.
I can't stand it when she's like this.
- Professor...
- Huh?
Professor you tell him
No, no, no. Please
Oart say I blame him, why should he get involved?
- Shut up
- I need air, fresh air
If that means you're going to latch
onto Jane, forget it, she told Laetia that...
Oh mind you're own business!
Where you going?
To Fiumuncinco? To see Gigi's boat
Oh great! Me too! Maybe we can even
go for a sail, it's such a beautiful day.
A friend of ours ordered this fantastic boat
It doesn't have your terrace upstairs,
but at least he'll not get kicked out.
Oh Oonrad! You're a genius
Let's go right now. You're staying here then?
What for?
To see about the house and if Mummy needs
anything, trouble with the foreman, I don't know
Oome off it, just give her a ring.
Besides, it's better if the
Professor talks to the foreman
That way there's no chance
they will screw things up
Oome on if you want, but now
Keep the photograph, and if you
want to see the original, let me know
Just one quick call. No, I'll phone from the bar
downstairs, I've got to eat a sandwich, I'm starving
I'm late and I'm not waiting
But I've got cramps
Professor, could you offer
me something? Anything at all
- Laetia hurry up, come on
- It'll only take a second
Elmenia! Elmenia!
Oome!
Laetia!
Laetia, for Ohrist's sake, I haven't got all
Shit
- What would you like?
- Ah! Stefano, Oonrad! Oome here!
The Professor's been holding out on us!
Stefano. Take your car so
you can be on your own
- I might be bothered tonight
- You're really leaving Bianca?
I've got to get away
I'm working on something
- You're working?
- Fuck off!
- Stefano want some cheese?
- Oh yeah thanks
- Bring me some glasses please
- You will excuse my fingers...
- Oh it's quite alright
- I think you will like this
- Thanks, may I have a little piece of cheese too?
- Move!
- Want me to answer it?
- Elmenia! The door
- No, I'll go, I'll go.
Professor, do me a favour and throw them all out
Who is that?
- Mmm, that smells good, just a taste, eh?
- No, it's not ready yet.
Oalm down Stefano, Elmenia's not used to having
so much confusion around her
Too many cooks spoil the food they say
The soup!
You bastard
He didn't want to rent the apartment at all,
but I persuaded him just the same
Because of you. He didn't want
alterations, yet we're making alterations
and in the end he probably
would've sold it to us too!
But you have to spoil everything!
You're suspicious, petty, mean!
You've made me ashamed of
everything I've done for you.
You make me ashamed of myself!
I'll never forgive you for that. Never!
Just a minute!
Leave me alone!
Let go of me, it's finished, let go!
I don't give a shit about the apartment,
but you're absurd pretending to give me presents!
You're hurting me, are you out of your mind?
Stop biting me! Let me go!
- Go on, scream
- Yes!
Oh Professor listen, here it is
Plan A - you're coming down with us to the boat
Plan B - this evening we come back
here, eat dinner, devouring that stew
and decide about the work upstairs
- Good
- Mummy!
Sounds fine to me
- I'm sure Elmenia's a marvellous cook
- Exceptional, I've had a sample
A stew and what else?
- Oh, stew and artichoke mousse
- Ah, perfect!
Oan we get started please?
Where to darling?
Oonrad said he was going to take us
down to see Gigi's boat at Fiumucino
The Professor's coming too
There's a west wind the sea will be lovely
The sea is always lovely. Oolours of
the sea, voices of the sea, its moods,
I could never understand how the
Greek Gods could concentrate so many wonders
when they had before their eyes, always, but
a haunting spectacle, fascinating, spellbinding,
I only have to think of the sea
and it completely fills my imagination
Then you'll go with us?
I wouldn't think of it
Oh, why not?
Because the Professor doesn't care for such
distractions, he wants to be alone, remember?
Everybody says they want to be alone, but it's not true
Yet, he lives alone all the same
Professor, the truth. You're such a mysterious man
You must have been terribly handsome,
you still are, I find you fascinating
But why, why do you lead
this sort of life?
You live among people, you're
forced to think about people,
instead of their works, to suffer
for the, to become involved
Besides, someone said, crows fly in flocks.
The eagle soars alone
We asked for it. Oome on crows, get flying!
- Bye Professor, see you tonight for dinner
- Good-Bye Laetia,
- Bye
- Senora
But the Bible says - woe to him that is alone when
he falleth, for he have not another to help him up
Oonrad! The Bible?
Goodbye Sir
Goodbye!
- Elmenia, clean up the table
- Yes, Professor
No one has called.
They probably had trouble with the car.
The traffic. Such refined people would
call I think, if they had the chance
They are not refined people as you call them.
They are rude, stupid. Useless people
I will have my dinner now.
I will not wait for them another moment
Very well, Professor
- Good morning Professor
- Good morning
- I want you to see this
- These are the samples?
Well. I haven't seen or heard from
these people in over two weeks!
I am wasting my time with these things
What you care Professor?
Do what you like, the house is yours
When it came to the walls
I could decide. But, these...
- You must decide Professor
- I must decide now?
Yes
Well, alright
Let me see
Well the kitchen...
I like ah... Ah! I like this colour
Yes, that's a nice strong colour
Very strong, for the walls
Professor!
Professor, come on out to the balcony a minute
We've got something for you
Professor? Come on out...
We've got a surprise for you,
can you open your door a minute?
We won't even come in,
we'll just hand it to you
Don't listen to them, see you
tomorrow Professor, goodnight!
Oh, please
I'll open the door
Hi Professor! We did try but we had
to bring you someone that will be able
to sing to you. Looks great upstairs!
It really is great, we'll get a better look tomorrow
in the daylight. Sure wish we had another bed.
Professor! Do you still have my blanket?
- Your blanket? Yes, yes it's just where you left it
- I'll get it
His name is Simon
I'm warning you, that's all he
can say, and he never stops!
That's why we bought him
Say hello to him...
I've never kept an animal in the house
Animals should be set free to
live in their natural environment
If he breaks your balls, send him
up to me and I'll break his neck
He drove Oonrad crazy on the boat,
we put the bird in his cabin
You made a big mistake
not to come with us Professor
What? You've got to be kidding!
Believe me, you did a good thing... lucky...
Oh Professor, if you could
just keep the bird for tonight, I promise you
that by tomorrow morning we'll...
Listen young man, I want a word with you
I wouldn't like to repeat the
experience of the last time.
You were supposed to come back that
evening and go over some plans with me
More than a month has gone by
Hey, come here! I found the
skeletons, he's Bluebeard!
What is it?
Hey! Not bad
Not bad. It's brillant!
Was it here or did you have it made?
It was here. It was very useful
to many people during the war
There's really nothing of interest
for you to see, it's just a room
Stefano, come on...
My mother who was Italian
lived here during the war
She had this secret apartment
built, to hide political refugees...
Partisans, Jews...
I know very little about her
life in this house at that time
She died before the war ended
I was in America and I came
back to relieve the Fifth Army
I've been living here ever since
Professor we're going,
I can't keep my eyes open
- You coming Oonrad?
- Yeah alright. I'd better get my blanket
You know I am very disappointed,
I was sure you'd fall in love with Simon
Perhaps I will
Well, I'm all set
Once more I have the honour
of sleeping above your head
- But no one is to know, you understand?
- No
- Oiao, goodnight
- Goodnight
Bianca thinks he's on his way to
Vienna, a well-earned vacation
after being stuck with her in
the same cabin for a month
Oh shut up Stefano
Oiao Professor, goodnight
Goodnight Laetia.
Oome,
Ciao Conrad! See you tomorrow
- Goonight Stefano
- Goodnight
Ciao Laetia
Who's that?!
Stop!
Oh my God! What happened?
I better call the police
Don't call anybody, mind your own business.
If you want to help me get me out of here
Alright, alright
I'll help you downstairs
Easy
Don't move
It's alright
Where am I?
In my apartment, you fainted twice,
I practically had to carry you downstairs
I'll be right back
Lousy bastards!
You better lie down
- Did you know the men who attacked you?
- I... no
I didn't even see them,
they got me from behind
I had a good look at one of them,
I am sure I could recognise him
But you told me, with great insistence
you told me not to call the police
I assumed they were people you knew,
someone you'd had an argument with
- I thought I'd make sure before calling
- For Ohrist sake, don't!
It's my duty to help...
...to call the police
- You don't have any duty
I don't want to have anything
to do with the police
They won't find the bastards,
they won't even look for them
They're occupied by the several
other festivities of city life
Murders, rapes, robberies,
strikes, demonstrations,
the police don't give a damn
about how my split lip
If I get my name on their files,
and the shit starts to fly...
No, the police don't give a damn
There might be some smart arse reporter,
who recognise the name of the young man.
Her frequent dancing partner,
that's the expression they like to use,
with Madam Brumont of
the well known fascists
Now do you begin to understand?
Good
- Blood
- Blood?
- There must be bloodstains all over upstairs
- Yes, but they will clean that up tomorrow
I told you for Ohrist's sake, I told
you I don't want anybody to know
- Let me go, the work men are here tomorrow
- Alright, alright
I'll go, I'll clean them up
You stay here...
You stay here
But take my advice, let me call a Doctor
You shit, all you can think
of is calling people
Alright, alright
Professor
You mind if I stay here tonight?
The idea of going back upstairs kills me
Sure, sure, you stay here and rest,
I'll be back soon
It's humiliating to get beaten up.
At least if I kill you you save face.
This way people shall just laugh.
Did you hear?
I kicked his arse in good
Let me get you a tranquiliser
No, I never take them
What did you do? Lock me in?
Elmenia comes in early, to clean up the study
I'm sorry
My nerves are all shot
No, leave it open, I can't stand being trapped
Seeing me like this, you
probably think I am a coward
along with whatever else you think of me
Professor? Have you ever been afraid?
Yes
Yes, I've been afraid, I was
in the war and I was afraid
But there are many kinds of fear, I was even
more afraid when I gave up my profession
Afraid of not knowing how to begin life all over again
- Your profession?
- I was a Doctor of Science at the time
Funny. I thought you were a science
professor when I first met you
- Once
- Once?
The price of progress is destruction
I began to realise that
modern science can't be neutral
In fact it has to serve practical ends
I saw turning technology's power to
liberate into a kind of a slavery
As far as reality is concerned, it's a...
Ah! Already here are you?
- The young people are with the Professor then?
- No, no
Didrt they come last night?
Oh keep quiet! Ghastly, isn't it?
- May I use the phone?
- I bring it to you
I am so sorry but we will soon have our own
Professor...
I'm sorry I didn't know you were here
The lady from upstairs wants to use the phone.
You slept here all night?
- What?
- You slept on...
No, no, no. I was... no...
I woke up early, I came in here to do
some work and I suppose I fell asleep
- I'll get your breakfast then...
- Yes, but ah, bring it in here
- The telephone is in the drawing room
- Thank you
- Poor thing, he must be famished
Oh, Elemenia, would you bring me a coffee please?
There's someone at the door, Elmenia
Is Madam Brumonti here?
- Is that my chaffeur? Amici, I'm in here
- Yes Madam?
Alright, alright, Amici.
Tell him I'll be right down
Oh, in the meantime, tell him to go
and buy some food for Simon
Hello? Hello!?
Daniela, Daniela, Daniela, come quick!
Oh! Give me that Miss
- Thankyou
- Oh, I mean Madam
So, that's a little American boy?
He looks like you though.
- Oare to come and help us?
- Yes, certainly
Say something
Say hello to Luisa
He's shy
Don't you like my house?
Of course you do!
Would you like a candy?
How sweet, he's so shy
Put it there, on the table
Madam Brumonti asked for
some coffee, I gave it to her
Alright
I was asleep for sixteen hours,
why didn't you wake me up?
It did you good
Besides you would have difficulty
slipping out unobserved
When I woke up this morning
Madam Brumonti was in the house
- Was she looking for me?
- No
She came in to use the telephone,
then she took Elmenia upstairs to give
her a hand with something or another
A lot of coming and going all day
- Does Elmenia know I am here?
- No
No she didn't notice a thing
I'd put that awful bird out on the back stairs
and cover it's cage with a cloth.
Leave it in the kitchen, those
creatures must be kept warm
Why don't you give it to Domenico?
He loves it so
- I'll return it to the person who gave it to me
- Is there anything more you wish Professor?
- No, no, thankyou, that's all for now
- Goodnight Elmenia
- Goodnight Professor
Look, I want to tell you something
I lied to you last night
I know who beat me up and I know why
I never doubted that
- You have every right to ask me questions
- There's no need to explain, I'm not curious
Your lip seems to be doing fairly well
It will be alright
You can't wait for me to leave, can you?
In a way
Okay
It was kind of you to help me
I can understand you not
wanting to be involved any further
That has nothing to do with it.
I am accustomed to being alone
The sense of another
presence in the house disturbs me
Prevents me from working
Just give me time to make a couple of
phone calls. I'll see if I can leave tonight
As you wish
The things I told you about myself, remember?
Well, they're true
While trying to pull myself out of smaller messes,
I've really got into big ones
I wasrt always like this, once I...
Oh shit
I've become so fucking cynical about everything
Everything I've ever cared about,
I didn't really sleep all day
I kept waking up, heard you moving about
I imagined, I imagined I was
telling you about myself
- asking your advice
- I'm afraid I have no advice
Besides a young man of your age,
your intelligence, should know what to do
Make a clean break? Sure
It's that simple
If Elmenia's gone to bed,
I'll get you something to eat
Then I'm going to bed myself,
make all the phone calls you want
When you leave, shut that door carefully.
I'll straighten things up tomorrow
I want to tell you everything, I have to tell
you everything that's happening to me
I need you near me, helping me
Oh! We woke him up
When you see a fair form, chase it, and
if possible embrace it! Be it a girl or a boy
Don't be bashful, be brash,
be fresh, life is short!
So enjoy whatever contact your
flesh might at the moment crave
There is no sex life in the grave
What are you saying?
You taught it to me, don't you remember?
He says it's Ordors last poem.
You know everything, did you know that?
Your wounded warrior Professor asked us to
bring him a suitcase and a car
Looks like he and Bianca
are breaking up after all
There's no such thing as a clean break
What does that mean?
- The Professor knows
- Oh, he knows everything
But how about telling me?
The Professor said that I
should change my life
Oh is that all?
Professor you don't know
what you're asking
Why what do you know?
Stefano's major disaster in life is envy
One day you must tell me darling,
what that crowd's got that I should envy
Yeah, well one day I will.
Poor Professor, you're still half asleep,
don't worry, we'll be going now
You see, it's only like a game we play.
There's nothing terrible in it, I mean when
you were young, werert you the same?
No
Absolutely not
You missed out on a lot
But you must have had some kind of fun, you're
wealthy and handsome... What did you do?
- What did I do?
- Right
I studied, I travelled, I was in the war
Got married, but that didn't work
And then when I found time to look
around I discovered I was in the midst of people
with whom I had nothing in common
Oh come off it Professor, we're not that far apart
- No, he's right
- How?
Let's remember, society is what it is
The fault is...
Oh Oonrad will you please,
not now with all that crap
I want to hear more about the Professor,
his private life, his past, present
Present?
- Presently I'm an old man
- Oh Professor, stop it, you know you're not old
You keep forgetting you're
a very attractive man
At least I think so
- What would you do if I wanted to kiss you?
- I wouldn't envy you
Because if I put myself in your place
I would see approaching me,
the face of a man who hasn't
been young for a long time
Out it out!
But I'm serious! I mean it, he really turns me on!
- I would marry him if he asked me
- I won't ask you
Do you think of me as one of those
characters in a comic opera?
The old man who's mocked and betrayed?
The only love story that would suit a man of my
age is King Lear's, a father's love for his children
You avoided that one rather
nicely, no children, no fuss
Ah, but the Professor would be a super father.
You know what, the first time one of those
two creeps gets careless and knocks me up
to hell with abortion! I am going
to have the baby and give it to you
I don't have much time left,
I'd need an older child
Someone to whom I
could tell the few things I know
Oonrad! Adopt Oonrad!
He's intelligent and handsome,
distinguished looking
and if he'd only stop with all those
schemes to make money he'd be perfect!
Oonrad! You've just been adopted
He'll be a bit expensive though,
at least in the beginning
li think you ought to be warned
Like tonight he might even
ask you for 5 million lire.
Poor Oonrad! A gambling debt in a low dive
that was the only reason
they bashed his face in
thought we were going to pay his debt off with the
money your mother gave us to fix up the apartment
Whether she knows it or not, Bianca's
always the one that pays his bills
a gambling debt
that wouldn't be so bad,
shame it isn't exactly true
- Where's my jacket?
- I don't know
I've got to go now if I want to
be in Munich tomorrow evening
there it is on the chair
Oh yeah
We'll walk you to the car, okay?
You've got to persuade him to adopt you
I'll do my best, if it makes you happy
Professor! Tell your son he
shouldn't drive like a madman
You'll risk losing him before
you've even adopted him
And I'll risk losing my car!
Would you come to my funeral Professor?
You'd probably be the only respectable
person in the whole procession
Every whore in Rome, dressed in black, will be there
Like a parade of snivelling widows
followed by all the junkies, conmen and dykes
and a delegation of faggots!
- Professor
- Yes?
- Professor, excuse me
- What is it Domenico?
These two gentlemen would like a word with you
I don't have an appointment with anyone
- They are the Police
- Police?
Yes.
May I have a word with you Professor?
I'm Sergeant Brunei, from the Oantelli Precinct
We need a bit of information,
if it isn't too much trouble
- I'm on my way out
- It'll only take a minute
Ah, Oonrad Huble, is this
gentleman living here with you?
Absolutely not
So you don't know this ah, Huble?
You asked if he lived with me,
I told you he did not
But you do know him?
Yes, we've met, as the guest of tenants
who've rented an apartment belonging to me
We would be very grateful if you could
stop by the police station Professor.
At your convenience, naturally.
- But I tell you, there's nothing
- The inspector can explain it all better
The fact is that this, Huble, insists
he was at your house the night of
February 2nd and all day February 3rd
I'll accompany you to the police station
- Simply ghastly
- Oh Mummy come on
- It looks awful
- But we could use a touch of colour over the sofa
Well that's a lot of money for
a little touch of colour
- It wasrt expensive
- It was Fifteen thousand dollars, it's practically a gift
I think an oil painting would've been perfect there
- I'll go down to the Professor and ask him
- What?
He can lend us one of his
Yeah, some loose Rembrandt
he's got hanging around
Oh Professor! How nice
Have you come looking for your Elmenia?
I'm so sorry, I've really taken shameless
advantages these last few days
- Elmenia. If you've finished your work here...
- Yes
...there's some things for you to do downstairs
- Yes, Sir
Are you revolted?
You'll get used to it.
I let the children decide, since they're
the ones who will be living here.
But tell me I'm right, I think an
oil painting would look perfect there...
Did you know that Oonrad Huble
was stopped at the border?
Stopped?
By the police...
But... When, where?
He's in Munich?
The children brought him to the airport the
night we came back from our cruise
He left here last night by car,
but that's not important...
It certainly is important
because it's not true!
What's not true?
What is it Mummy?
The Professor says that Oonrad left by car
Yeah, we didn't tell you because
you get so worried when he drives
- What happened? Has he had an accident?
- He just told you, he's been arrested!
I didn't say that. The police stopped
him because they had some suspicions
In explaining things, he used my name.
Mentioned that he'd passed
the last few days at my house
- All very annoying...
- Is it true that he left last night?
Yes, we were with him, he stayed on longer
because he said he had some things to do,
business or something...
What I don't understand is all this mystery!
Why didn't you tell me?!
Really Mummy...
It's all a part of that stupid mania of
yours to join together against me
and now Professor,
you're in it with them, hmm?
I'm not in anything, I merely allowed him
to stay at my apartment, as he asked
Ah, that's very sweet Professor, has
Oonrad turned his boyish charm on you too?
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said
Oh Mama stop it! Just because
Oonrad stayed on an extra day or two and you didn't
know it there's no reason...
Keep still will you!?
She turns smart only when she has to think up
an excuse for spending the night away from home
didn't you hear? They arrested him!
Why? What did he do while he was here?
- Oart you understand how worried I am?
- It's not true, you're justjealous!
You have to know where he is every
second of every hour, let him breathe!
- Everybody has a day off
- Oh stop this
Professor! Oould you explain to me why
Oonrad asked you to put him up?
It's not my place to tell you.
I didn't even tell the police, and believe
me it cost me some effort
It is not my habit to keep
silent about such things, in any case they will
probably search my house
and up here too, they're looking for drugs.
What I didn't know was that
the police have, shall we say, a long record
concerning Oonrad Huble
We knew all about that, tell him Mummy.
Oonrad belonged to a radical group
in Berlin, that's why he has a record
- Don't talk nonsense
- You're being unfair
You know he was arrested then,
he was one of the most active
How true, he was active alright.
Running around the barricade with a fanatical
little bitch who by pure coincidence was the
daughter of one of
the richest men in Berlin!
You can be sure of one thing, to reach his goal
Oonrad's capable of exploiting anything,
even a protest movement!
Oh you love putting him down
I may be infatuated with
Oonrad but that doesn't mean
I don't know what sort of
person I am dealing with!
Have you any idea why Oonrad
couldn't get off the boat in Oannes?
Because if he sets foot in France
they'll put him in jail as quick as a wink!
I am appalled, horrified!
What sort of people are you?
You entrust your daughter, a minor, to someone
for whom you have absolutely no respect?!
I certainly do not entrust her to him!
They live together, in this house...
Mummy's making him sound
terrible, he's not that bad
I'm notjudging anyone,
Oonrad may be a saint for all
I know, unjustly accused!
The important thing is that your
mother considers him a wastron,
immoral and a person of no consequence...
and still she leaves her
young daughter in his charge!
She forces him upon
her acquaintances!
My acquaintances are all vaccinated,
don't worry about that Professor,
and yet Laetia isn't in the slightest danger!
In my house I saw proof to the
contrary... but we won't go into that
It is my duty to warn you, in case you had...
In case I had any illusions?
No! I have no illusions!
For me, that is your only possible excuse
We have nothing further to say to each other
Professor, Madam Brumonti
asked me if I could
give her a hand once in a while,
I didn't know what to do, I...
If you wish to help them then you are free
to do so, I prefer not to see them anymore
Yes, alright
You were not at all nice to your Grandfather
He's so happy to have us here,
he's alone so much
It's terrible to be left alone
when you're old and ill...
Alone?
He's not alone, he has a cook and a
maid and he's even got a cat...
I don't have a cat
Elmenia! Go upstairs at once, tell those
people to stop making so much noise!
Yes, yes, Sir
Hello
- Oh is that you Professor?
- Yes this is he
- I hope we're not disturbing you
- As a matter of fact you are disturbing me!
And I'd appreciate it if you turned
down that music a bit
Yes, Sir, I'll do it right away
- Thankyou
- Oh Professor
Yes?
Do you know we had our own telephone?
Well it's quite evident that you
have your own telephone now
- the number is 6, 7, 6, 0, 1, 3. Did you get that?
- 6, 7, 6, 0, 1, 3.
If you need anything just call us
- Have you written it down?
- Yes, I've written it down
Hello?
Professor I know I am bothering you
again, but you didn't answer my letter
- Letter?
- Yes, I've received no letter
Oh you didn't see it?
I slipped it under your door this evening
- Oh, oh I see
- I'd like an answer
Something told me you wouldn't
answer, so I decided to come down
You haven't read it yet? Hail! Oonrad came back,
so we decided to have, a sort of housewarming
But then at the last minute we didn't feel
like it, a couple of friends came by anyway
we were listening to some music, dancing
and talking, would you like to come up?
Thank you but I ah...
Did the police tell you, Oonrad had nothing
to do with that mess they bothered you about
Yes they did
You said some terrible things to us
the other day, we were quite upset
I allowed myself to be carried away,
I shouldn't have
You made a lot of sense though.
But all those things Mummy said, I mean she
really doesn't know everything about Oonrad
none of us do
Poor Oonrad, he would do just about anything
to make money, he gambles, gets in trouble
well you saw...
and the only time he won big he
spent it all on a present for Mummy
He's so proud to know a man like you
Maybe he once had ambitions
we know nothing about?
Anyway, would you please come upstairs?
You'd make everybody happy
Just for a little while?
- No
- It will never happen again
Try to forget, I'm the one who mustrt
We'll start all over from the beginning
- Will you come?
- No, I'm... I'm working
If you wish, you may all come
here to dinner tomorrow night
Really?
- Half-past Eight
Is this the wine from your country estate?
Where is it exactly?
Visconia, near Eretzo
Good
Hang on Professor, dinner's almost
over, you'll be rid of us in a minute
You're so gloomy, you didn't
want to have us here, did you?
- Laetia forced you into it
- No I didn't, I...
- No it was my own idea
- Well then why don't you say something to us?
Oh don't listen to him, we're all
sort of down, not our fault though,
there's a new tragedy here every 5 minutes
It's the same everywhere
I hadrt been home for lunch in
a long while, so I went today
Big mistake. My father's workers
have been on strike on a week
He and my brother are still not talking
and Dad just sat there, silent, at the
head of the table, like you Professor
But you don't have any workers striking...
or a son posing as a Marxist
You have the figures in your paintings,
you're surrounded by calm, serene people,
without any problems
Do you like them all?
Oh I have my preferences... and my infidelities
For a long while I favoured the Sitwell family
I went so far as to bring them into my bedroom,
but that relationship proved to be incompatible
I found myself quarrelling with the
oldest daughter, the tall one over there
And you are you going to quarrel
with in this new family?
What family?
This one? Soon I'll be quarrelling with
all of you, in fact I already have
That's all over though, because, here we are!
Old people are strange animals my dear.
Don't you know that?
Oross, intolerant.
With sudden fears of the solitude
they've made for themselves.
Which they then defend as soon as they see
threatened, it was during one such brief attack
that I invited you all to
come here this evening
I would say that now you've
come back to your senses
It's not right though
I think it's time for a change
Look Professor, your solitude is over,
we just like it too much here, and
we're going to be around this table a lot.
She's already formed a family Professor
Yes, I've already formed a family and
Mummy sits at the head of the table
Well at least I'm part of the family
Mummy!
No, no, don't get up please
Of course you're part of it
- Thank you darling
- We've just decided to form it
Father, Mother and children
You look sensational
A slightly incestuous family, if I may say so
Silly boy
Again my apologies Professor
Oh, it's nothing. Elmenia, would you...
Don't bother, I've already had my dinner
- But I'll taste a piece of that wonderful cake
- Yes, Madam
May I say Madam, that we are
delighted that you could join us
You were wise to take on a spare
father, since you're real one's gone
Daddy?
I just drove him to the airport.
Airports, nowadays, have become cemeteries
What made you go all the way out there?
I am still wondering myself,
a nightmare evening
- I think your Daddy has gone just slightly mad
- He says the same thing about you
My husband had invited a couple, friends of
his, some people named Guspare, to dinner
and since he first had to talk with somebody
about an urgent matter, he asked me to stay
on for a while and entertain his guests
while he dealt with his business. I was just
saying hello to them, when my husband
came in and like a wild man,
he said he had to go away at once
And what's more, I had to accompany him to
the airport because he had to talk to me
Dad had to talk to you?
What about the Guspares?
Simply aghast!
For a moment, I even
thought of sending them here
Lovely idea! But where is Daddy?
Where did he go?
To Madrid
He told the Guspares that the political situation
is very serious and that he had to go off, I don't
know, on some confidential business,
something like that, with the Villa Verdi himself
They seemed to believe him, if you ask me,
your father, only just realised that the shooting
season opens at
the Villaverdes tomorrow
He was there last year too
Who did he speak to before dinner?
I don't know dear, a man I'd never seen before.
He said he was a man that was from the press
office of the Senate.
Shall we, shall we have
our coffee in the library?
But that's not the end of
this crazy story you know
Excuse me
Was the man who spoke to your
husband Berti Gesperti by any chance?
I don't know I already told you
Thankyou, I'll serve it
- Who would like some coffee?
- Mummy never takes coffee in the evening
But tonight I will, just a
little, with a drop of cream
- May I serve?
- Please
- Mummy?
- That's good
- Professor?
- Yes, ah, just black
- Conrad, how do you...
- I'll help myself
- Stefano?
- No thanks
Now that we are after meal,
I'll tell you the rest of my evening
I'd listen carefully because it
concerns you in particular
After walking out on the Guspares,
we dashed right off to the airport,
and you know what my
husband had to say to me?
He demands, that was the word, he demands,
that I get rid of you at once and never see you again
Daddy said that? When was Daddy...
Precisely! Never
And yet he seemed so upset that at
first I didn't want to contradict him
- I've never seen him in such a state
- Old flames never die, he's jealous!
Oh Laetia, for heavers sake!
He made it clear, that he had
no objection to a replacement
but Oonrad, no
But then you should have heard
the ridiculous things he said! That
if I don't get rid of you, he will
Then I lost my temper and I said, if this is
how things are, I prefer to divorce and
that's what we'll do
- To marry Oonrad?
- No!
For that matter, Oonrad's never proposed
to me, isn't that so darling?
- I am now
- And I thank you
But the answer is no
People marry to form a family,
they divorce to desert it and to be free
- Free to marry again?
- No, free. Just free
That's not what you really mean
Of course it is. What's the matter with him?
- Tell them why you want to marry me
- Out it, you're a bore
- Oonrad
- Shall I tell them?
Don't bother I can do it myself
I'm not marrying you because
you're 12 years younger than I am
and because you're
not the sort one marries
Not the sort? Why not?
You're not the least amusing you know?
I'm not trying to be, answer me
He's drunk. He drank all through dinner
I'm not drunk! And I'm not trying
to persuade this woman to marry me
It would be absurd. I am what I am but I
also know what you people are.
And I don't allow
anyone to laugh at me
No one is laughing at you
I beg your pardon,
I am not referring to you.
Now darling, tell me why,
according to the rules of your
respected society,
I am not the sort one marries?
Oh, enough of this bullshit
What's wrong with you?
Has something happened?
Where I come from doesn't count,
it's where I've been that matters right?
Kept boy. Illegal dealings,
that's what counts
Yes darling, that counts
It only counts against me,
because I wasrt successful
because I'm still a lapdog, that an important lady
boldly took into places where dogs aren't allowed
and the others had to put up with the lapdog, when
it stole from the kitchen, ripped the floor, bit people!
I can't listen to you say these things!
You know very well it's not true!
Oh Bianca, for God's sake,
you're only encouraging him!
Havert we heard enough of his lectures
on the corrupt capitalist society?
Is that where we are again?
That society doesn't even exist and if it did be
grateful you were one of the last to benefit from it
But it does exist, it does exist, even
more dangerously today than ever,
because it's camouflaged.
Oh no, not you Professor,
I'm no reactionary,
I thought you understood that
No I hadrt, that's been camouflaged too
Though I've yet to meet an
intellectual who doesn't say he's left wing
luckily apart from rare exceptions,
it never shows up in their lives or work
The intellectuals of my generation,
tried to find a balance between politics
and morality, the
search for the impossible
That search sure keeps them busy,
they're very lucky
But his soul isn't tortured politically!
Let alone morally
So how can he justify his hatred for a
society that lets him live like a gentlemen?
Even if he did come in
through the service entrance
Alright, with a frayed shirt and a corduroy
jacket which I couldn't button
because I'd outgrown it!
The first time I went into one of those marvellous
houses and in the bed, of the lady of the house
She wasrt beautiful like you, but she seemed
stupendous to me, I had a lump in my
throat and tears in my eyes
I was really in love, when I held her
It was what I wanted and I did
everything I could to stay there
My methods, which you are so ashamed of, I learned
there they are the same methods your world uses
Just the names are different, because the stakes
are so much higher, they have beautiful ringing
names, which you pronounce
with great respect
Instead of puking them out, you
think you move among gentlemen,
not knowing that they're murderers
And I told you, that your husband has run off
because they discovered that members of
his crew were about to assassinate
a dozen top Oommunists and
other members of the government.
Enough to take it over,
you would be amazed!
I wouldn't be amazed,
I'd say you're raving mad!
My husband is an industrialist,
right-wing, naturally, but where are the left-wing
industrialists?!
Some of them may say they are.
My husband is to the right, and says so openly
Good for him! But from that, to say
he deals in organised crime!
In fact he does! Ask Stefano!
He knows something about it
- You're crazy
- The lady's little lap dog
- has a sharp scent
- I see, you also do that, huh?
Protection for what you
call your small time activities
When they come pounding on the door,
everbody's running, to flush the coke down the can
But not you, you're cool, they stopped you
at the border but the next day they let you go
Protection! Protection for being
an informer and a slanderer!
That's enough!
No it's not slander, I have informed
them and I am glad I did it
Professor will you permit that
in your own house?!
You fucking son of...
- Get the hell out!
- No, no, no don't!
Professor!
I will not permit this! Not you
and not you!
People damned in hell while away their time
accusing each other in the way you two do
Just a minute
Oonrad has volunteered his
side of the story,
allow me to fill out the picture
As a matter of fact Professor you
have had every opportunity
to see the world he lives in
All for small time operators, who for a bit
of stuff went and split his lip upstairs
Those are his people,
that's what he knows!
- That's the world he should talk about!
- Answer him!
You bastard!
Stop both of you! You tear at each other like
wild animals, I thought you loved each other
You were friends, real friends, inseparable!
Love each other? Friends? Oh, sure.
We're together all the time, we eat, we talk, we laugh
and fuck together!
But when the fun is over,
where are your friends then?
Each one goes his own way
Yes, each one goes his own way.
People like you always land on their feet
Fine, seeing you all agree,
I'll clear out, that should make you happy
That's what you want Professor? Isn't it?
You've said some very offensive things
Which I won't take back, nor apologise for.
Thanks for the dinner Professor, but take my
advice, keep out of the mess, as you always have
And stick to your charming dead friends, who
can't be hurt by the violins of those Fascist clowns
I hope you'll suffer
- I hope I get over it quickly
- You always land on your feet too
It's hard at my age darling,
but I will do my best
Where are you going? I'll go with you
No
I always thought I was helping him. Nice
clothes, travelling, that's part of life too isn't it?
And if in fact he did wrong,
I was still doing something for him
because I love him
Leave me alone!
You offended him, alright, okay.
And you fired him as though he were a servant,
someone you caught stealing
Even that was to be expected.
But you Professor, you had no right to
turn your back on him, no, no right.
No, not you. Not you, not you.
Oh come on! Lets not have any unnecessary guilt,
if you want to, I'll go look for him right now
and invoke his forgiveness.
I hope Oonrad will not forgive
anybody, at least of all
The day a certain Madam Brumonti came to see
me, to ask about renting the apartment upstairs.
I refused.
Because I was afraid of having
people around me that I didn't know
People who might disturb me, everything
has turned out far worse than I'd ever imagined
If ever a landlord had difficult
tenants, I believe I had them.
And yet I found myself thinking,
as Laetia once said
They could really have been my family.
A family that turned out well or badly,
absolutely different from me
But since I love this wretched family,
I want to do what I can for it.
As it unawares has
done something for me.
There's a writer whose books I
keep on a table by the bed.
And read from time to time. He tells about a tenant
who moves stealthily into the apartment above him.
The writer hears the tenant moving about, stirring,
walking, and then suddenly he seems to vanish.
For a long time he isn't heard again.
But he comes back.
Gradually his absence becomes more rare,
his presence more constant
His death.
The awareness that he has reached
the end of his life
announced to him, in one of death's
many deceitful disguises.
Your presence above me,
has meantjust the opposite to me
And I don't believe I've been deceived.
You've awakened me, from a sleep, as profound,
as insensitive, and as deaf as death itself
Professor, they just brought this letter,
Elmenia,
- what's the matter?
- Run upstairs and see if Mr Huble is there
Go, go. Go, go!
Yes sir
Dear Professor, I hope I am wrong but
I don't think we'll ever see each other again.
Your son, Conrad
- Oh! Oh God!
- Please do not touch him
Wait for the police
Try to breathe normally
That's better
I'll be finished in a few minutes
Professor,
You have visitors,
I've given the keys to Elmenia,
my lawyer will be talking with yours,
to see if you can recover some
of the expense you went to upstairs
and they'll handle everything
for the police investigation.
I wish, I really wish I could
also have some doubts
Unfortunately, Oonrad killing himself
was his way of having the last word.
It was his cruel, senseless
way of punishing us
forever... But there is one thing Oonrad
didn't have time to learn... That we'll forget him
We will forget.
He was too young to have
learned this final, nasty, fact
Grief is as precarious as everything else.
Goodbye Professor
But don't believe her, he did
not kill himself, they murdered him.
You were the only one
to have a little faith in him
Don't deny him that now that he's dead.
Good bye.
