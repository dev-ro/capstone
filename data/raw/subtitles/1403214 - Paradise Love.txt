Watch out!
Toni, be careful.
You have to turn the wheel.
Turn it!
Turn the wheel!
Turn it! Come on!
Be careful!
That's it, enough.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Please take off your shoes.
How can you lie in bed
with dirty shoes on?
- So what about our agreement?
Our agreement??
First: clean the room.
Second: pack your things.
Take out everything you will need.
Put the phone away. Look at me.
So?
Why didn't you do it?
Give me a few more minutes.
How can you throw a clean shirt
on the floor like that?
Put everything clean into one pile,
okay?
Everything you'll take with you, here.
Everything you don't, there.
And all dirty clothes in the middle.
Allright?
And take off those dirty sneakers!
This is horrible!
How often did I tell you:
no candy in the room!
Did you buy the collar?
For Rolly, the flea collar?
- I forgot
- You forgot. Great.
That goes here,
and this one here.

Say, you do keep growing!
- What have you got there?
- A cat toilet.
- The cat also?
- Of course.
Place it here for now.
Why should I leave it there?
I don't want to have the cat inside.
Maybe in the garden?
- But she'll run away.
- You are right.
- Flowers.
- Downstairs I have more space.
Take a look downstairs,
there is plenty of space.
I'll put them in water.
Yes, let's go.
- Let's take a picture, yes?
- Sure.
Just a second.
Lovely! Look at that!
- Ok, Melli, goodbye.
- Bye.
Be a good girl, ok?
Do as you are told, and
everything will be fine.
PARADISE
LOVE
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to teach you some Suhaeli words
which you will be hearing
while you're here on your holiday.
The most important word is "Djambo"
which in Swahili means "Hello."
A word you will be hearing
more than 200 times a day.
So I'd like to practice it today.
Practice makes perfect.
- Djambo.
- Djambo!
Thank you so much.
Next: "Akuna Matata".
Akuna Matata means "No Problem"
Please, all together:
"Akuna Matata".
Once again please.
Akuna Matata.
Difficult, no? Wow!
- Such beauty!
- Yes.
- It's so beautiful.
- Yes.
- Amazing. Unbelievable.
- You can see the sea.
- Your keys.
- Thank you.
You like it?
Marvellous!
This unusual scent...
The air is different. Like...
You feel differently.
Don't you think?
I always feel like that here.
- I'm sweating.
- Wait until you smell their skin.
It's incredible.
You'll never forget it.
- Whose?
- The negroes' of course.
It smells like coconuts.
You just want to bite and lick it!
It's truly amazing,
you'll see.
- You are simply unbearable.
- You'll see!
I don't dare.
You'll be addicted soon.
Addicted!
They're really cute.
But they all look the same.
I just met this one guy
and mistook him for another.
- That's only in the beginning.
- Really?
You distinguish them
by their height.
- That's the easiest way.
- How tall they are, you mean?
Yes, whether they're
taller or shorter.
- Got it.
- Mine is a giant.
- He's big?
- Yes ... everywhere!
Incredible!
Yesterday he danced for me!
Really?
- A first class show!
- Dancing, how?
Just dancing, to music.
It was so sexy! I went crazy.
- Naked, you mean?
- Sure.
And then I taught him to say
"horny stud".
"You horny stud!"
He kept repeating "horny stud".
I'm getting all dizzy,
how could you?
Imagine him repeating "horny stud"!
It's too much for me.
- What?
- I don't know...
- Just allow it to happen!
- It happens all by itself you mean?
- Does it?
- Yes.
Sure
- Stop thinking. Let it flow.
- It's so strange to me...
- Let it be, let it flow...
- So strange... their skin, and...
- But that's the whole point!
The strangeness gives the kicks!
Do you think I should shave down there?
- What?
- No?
- Don't even think about it!
- Why?
They like that we are different
from their women.
They've got little curls down there,
just tiny ones,
and we've got real bushes.
My last boyfriend made me do it,
even though I don't like it.
Don't!
You'll just look like a baby.
I don't shave at all.
It falls out on its own.
But there are some patches left.
They like that too.
- Really?
- Oh they love it!
I like their curls too,
just like their head hair.
My last boyfriend always said
it's disgusting.
But I like hair down there.
Swallowing them you mean?
No. Just how it looks.
These bushes under the arms...
But why not?
I find it actually...
It looks very natural,
in my opinion.
The locals love everything
that's wild and untamed.
They like everything like it is,
that's why I don't shave.
You think it's unnecessary?
Yes! It's much more interesting that way.
They accept you
like you are, right?
That's the great thing, honey!
I don't give a shit anymore.
And it feels so good!
I have denied myself enough
just to please them.
One liked this, the other one that.
And I gave in to make them like me.
Now I am doing only what I like!
And they must take me as I am.
- That's great!
- Yeah, finally!
There. That's him. Look!
I don't need you. I want my boy!
Here's my bedtime toy.
Isn't he cute?
You call him a "toy"?
He doesn't understand German.
This is my Musa. This is Teresa,
my best friend from Austria.
I told you about her.
He has cute ears!
She'd like to borrow
you a little.
You'll have one of your own soon.
Beautiful hands, so strong.
Look how cool he is on his machine.
I bought it for him!
These thighs! Great!
- This is my pretty baby!
- You bought him this scooter?
- Yes, sure.
Your personal taxi.
It's paying off.
Let's go.
Give me a ride!
So, I'll be seeing you.
- Have fun!
Hello Caribou, here, here.
Here's Africa.
Welcome to Africa.
Don't be afraid.

maybe I am overpaying.
Thanks, Mama.

For more things, like...

Gabriel, yes? Thank you.
- Thank you, Gabriel, bye.
Akuna Matata.
We are just playing boccia but with shoes.
We use our shoes, OK?
Now, this is the goal.
You have to throw your shoes until here.

Great. You!
And you.
Cool!
Now everybody go for their shoe.
Everybody, faster, faster.

The other way round.
You can start.

- Inge.
Inge, ok, you can start.
Wonderful.
Super.
What's he cleaning actually?
It's gleaming like a piece of lard.
Why does he keep rubbing?
He wants to be near you.
Near me? Well, who knows.
He is gleaming himself like lard.
Hey you...
Hello. What's your name?
- Josphat.
- What?
- Josphat.
- Josfatz?
- Josfatz? You are new here?
- Yes.
- You have very beautiful teeth.
- Thank you.
And very beautiful lips.
Like the Meinl face in Austria.
("Uncle Ben's guy").
He really gleams like a piece of lard.
Do you know what "Speckschwartl" means?
"Speckschwarte"? (=lard)
Do you speak German?
- Little bit of German, yes.
Do you know what is "Speckschwarte"?
No.
Try to say it: "Speckschwarte".
"Speckschwart-l"! (with Viennese accent)
"Speck-schwar-tlll!"
Do you know what "bloody sausage" is?
No.
Try it: "Blunzen-gr√∂stl".
I think he's a bit dumb.
- But he is lovely.
- You like him?
You put on this. Yes?
You put on this?
For me?
Oooh, that's cool!

Yes, "Men in Black".

Let's get a tuk-tuk?
- It's crazy here!
Let's get away from here.
Thank you.
Dancing again?
- Yes, dancing.
Dancing?
You can do this
while you go.
While you go,
while you walk.
I like this more, this one... huuuh!
Good dance!
You'll make it because ...
It's a very good African dance.
- African dance!
You like?
- Yes.
I pay. I pay.
(speaks Swahili)
Is there change?
Come on, it's OK.
No problem.
Condom!
Where to?
Number Seven.
No, I don't like it.
No, I don't like it anymore.
No, I have never done it before
and it's really stupid...
Sorry, no.
Please, come on, mommy!
I feel it, I feel it, mommy.
- I feel my feelings, now come on...
Look to me.
I can't do it.
Why, why why not?
Okay, listen,
I know how to make you feel good.
No, please, please, please.
Not Mommy.
Stay like this, OK?
But don't do anything.
Please.... stay like this, but don't do anything!
Listen, I can't control myself.
I feel you.
Can I give... give you my present?
A gift.
I promise you a gift.
The time we meet I told you I give you a key...
- No, please...

Don't worry.
No, I don't want this.
Oh no, no, no, no, Mama!
Come on, don't do that...

No, you don't love me.
Ok, stop it now, please.

No, you don't love me.
Djambo! Djambo!
Safari?

- Yes.
- I am a printmaker.
- No, Thank you.
- I am a master engraver.
- Thank you, no.
I'm sorry, madam.
Here I have
very special price.
- I have no money.
- Very good price.
I just want to have a little walk.
- For how long are you here?
- For a while.
I'll come tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Good morning. "Gruess dich!"
Even your German won't help you,
I am not going to buy anything.
I do not need anything.
- I don't have money.
Tomorrow or the day after.
Our boat, here's our boat.
I just go for a little walk, OK?
Leave me walk alone, please!
Here, in Africa, we are all friends.
Alone? Aren't you scared?
No, I'm not afraid.
"I have no fear."
Everything - tomorrow.
Or the day after tomorrow.
Akuna Matata.
I'm not afraid to be alone...
You want me to see me infuriated?
Do you understand "Infuriated"?
You know this word?
Like this... aaargh!
Boat - tomorrow. Fish - tomorrow.
The necklace - tomorrow.
I'm sorry, over there are the reefs.
The reef - tomorrow.
The ship - tomorrow!
Today we only look.
Only looking.
OK, you go!
Here comes my German.
Excuse me.
You are free. You can look
if you want to look something.
If you need help,
you call me. My name is Munga.
What do you want to sell?
I don't want to sell you anything.
I just see the guys there harrass you.
I decided to come here and tell them
to stay away.
Now they are far. You can go.
Me I stay here. If you need help.
I don't believe.
You stay here!
- I stay here, you go.
If you need anything, call me.
- Let's see!
We will see... Munga.
- What's the problem?
- There was something ... sharp there.
Are you hurt?
I think a little... a little....
... sea urchin.
Here, you see?
It's fine. Thank you.
- Where are you coming from?
- Uhm... Austria.
Austria. Welcome to Kenya.
Kenya - Akuna Matata.
- Akuna Matata.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So you enjoy your beach walk?
I enjoy, yes. It's a little bit...
tiresome if everyone want to harass you
You're the only one who keep
distance? Do you understand?
I do not like...
I do not like to disturb.
It's no good.
- You speak some German?
- Yes.
I speak...
I speak a little German.
- Great.
Hello, darling.
It's Mom.
Sorry I forgot to call yesterday.
Please don't be angry.
The sun exhausted me.
I fell asleep at 6:00 already.
Kisses, kisses...
Be glad it's not so hot
where you are... Bye-bye.
I wish so much to be looked
straight into the eyes.
Do you understand?
I totally understand you.
I miss it so much.
Nobody knows how to do that anymore.
I don't like him to look intently,
and see my wrinkles...
Nobody needs to see that...
I want to be looked
into my soul.
Beyond the surface.
Right into my soul.
Beyond the wrinkles and the fat ass
but directly into the eye. - Sure.
Sure.
But I have a problem with that.
That way I realize
how ugly I am.
Come on! You are young and fresh!
No way!
I'd be happy to look like you.
Then I'd get a divorce,
but the way I look now...
I was in such a trap!
I didn't even dare to cheat on my husband.
He disliked everything about me.
He hated my haircut,
not matter what I did.
- You have a cool haircut now!
I would have been ashamed to undress
in front of other men.
- Are you serious?
- It's true!
Did you ever think
about plastic surgery?
- Never!
- Liposuction is great.
I've done it, it's great!
Then I'd need a
"whole-body-suction".
All over! A total renovation.
See, it is so important
to be looked into the eyes.
Because you want to be seen
as a human being.
And not just a body,
with saggy tits,
wrinkles, bad skin, fat ass.
You want to feel it is about YOU.
From the heart.
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.
You were born in a similar house?
- Yes.
Your village, these are
all these houses?
Yes. Yes.
- Do you lead these excursions often?
- Not really.
And you always bring women here?
- Nooo!
Only you.
- You bring all women here?
- No, no!
- Only you!
- Tell me, come on!
Be honest!
How many women have
you brought here?
- Only you.
- Only me?
Honey, come here.
- "Honey"??
- Me not married.
- You not married.
But I am very old,
and you are very young..
- Love has no end.
- "Love has no end"?
- No end.
Love never ends.
"Love - never - ends"!
- And you really think so?
- Yes.
I think love does end sometimes.
In Europe - maybe.
In Africa - no.
- It's different in Africa?
- Yes.
- Love never ends in Africa?
- Yes.
That would be nice.
And here's my house.
This is the bed.
And that is for water.
- And here...
- kitchen.
- Yes. This is my sofa.
- Very nice.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
In Africa, when a guest comes over,
a man must go and buy palm wine.
The best palm wine in Africa.
So me, I go, bring palm wine,
and return here.
- Right now?
- Yes.
- And you will return?
- Of course!
- Prost (cheers)!
- Prosts.
- "Pr-ost"!
- Pros..
Prost! Yes...
And some people do like this...
No wait.
Got it
Do you like it?
Not really. It's a little bit
like medicine.
Like medicine?
You drink slowly and then put here.
And relax a bit.
- So, you know...
- Can I smoke a cigarette in here?
Of course, feel at home.
How do you say it in Germany?
Is that a joint?
Yes, I used to smoke these.
Have you tried?
No, never.
Then I give you.
Isn't it dangerous?
Try! You try.
- I don't feel anything.
- You don't feel anything?
Well ok, give it to me.
- Slower, pole-pole (Swahili: "slowly").
- I'm OK.
Is it ok for you?
With me here?
Yes. Yes.
Really no problem?
- What?
No problems for sure?
No problems at all!
- For you?
- When we walk around like that...
- Yes...
everybody will think ... we are together.
- No problem.
- But...
No problem.
It seems unbelievable.
I can't believe really it.
People think that because I am with you,
I have money.
- You have money?
- They think I have money from you.
- And you want money?
- Me?
No money. Love.
It's love.
Yeah, just love.
Is it dangerous in here?
And you...
You say you like me.
Yes, I like you.
Why?
You are beautiful.
I like your hair,
beautiful smile.
And... my laugh?
No, no, don't pinch me.
Yes? Don't pin-ch.
- What?
- No pinching!
Don't always pinch me.
I am not pinching you either.
- Understood?
- Yeah, no problem.
- You must be tender.
- Tender?
Tender.
Like this, nicely.
- Like this?
- No.
Just one.
I am not an animal.
- Not like I'm a cat.
- You can't do like this.
- Why?
I am not an animal.
Do it like this, yes,
not so...
- but with feeling.
Do you understand? With feeling, ok?
- Ok.
- We try it.
- This?
- No.
- So like this?
- No, no.
Ok, look, if I make this -
it's not good.
You have to look to my eyes...
Yes.
Look to my eyes,
look into my heart...
Understand? Repeat:
"Look into my heart"
- "Look into my heart..."
- No, "your" heart...
I mean, look into MY heart.
- "Look into my heart".
- No. Look to my eyes.
- Yes, I look.
- You look.
- And then you can do this, but very slowly.
- Slowly.
- And just one for starters, OK?
- Ok...
Try it.
Yes, you can try both once...
And do the African men
not kiss?
- Kiss?
- Yes.
We kiss.
- You like more this than kiss?
I like kiss also, yes.
- Do you want to kiss me?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes, yes, I kiss you.
- Really?
- Yes.
Kiss.
If you put the whole tongue in
so quickly,
it's not so...
- You know what I mean?
- Not European.
Too much tongue.
First little tongue,
then more.
- It's called a Muzungu kiss.
- Muzungu kiss?
Yes.
Can you try to put the tongue
not so much in the beginning?
Ok.
Don't laugh too much.
Go on.
You are much more beautiful than me.
Really?
Everything... pfft.
And you...
No. No. You are beautiful.
A beautiful woman.
Well, you see, everything gets down.
Show me.
I show you, ok. I show you.
Everything goes down.
You will see.
Here, if you have this,
it's high.
- Yes.
- But if you do it down...
...it's going up...
uh, down.
- How can I believe you?
- Excuse me?
- How can I believe you?
- Shall I show it to you?
- Really?
Yes.
- Up.
- Yes.
Down.
Is good, is good.
- Really, they are good.
- But come on...
- You really think so?
- Yes.
Good.
Up.
Down.
It's good like this.
You do always like touchy touchy...?
So how do I do?
You have to be more...
not so... touchy touchy...
- more slowly, yes.
- Pole-pole.
- Pole-pole.
Pole-pole.
- Like this,Ok?
You can try.
Better is just one,
and then the other, yes?
Ok. This or this?
As you like it.
And then you can do this and kiss me?
Together.
Can you do everything at once?
- Together?
- No.
- Kiss me and play with my breasts.
But no pinching!
Ok, slowly.
Taxi! Taxi!
Mama, taxi!
Mama, taxi!
- Here! Come to me!
- We pay you later, we go beach.
Careful.
Croc-croc-croc!
- We leave shoes here.
- I take off my shoes?
Yes.
- Hello.
- Djambo.
Djambo.
This is my sister.
This is her daughter.
The other daughter is
sick in the hospital.
- Yes. Why?
- Malaria.
Sister... husband...
left her. Gone!
She is all alone.
I have to give them money
every month.
Why, hello!
Excuse me...
Do you have money to give her
for the baby because it's big problem.
- In the hospital?
- Yes.
- Problem?
- Yes.
Money. Money.
Is the treatment expensive?
And no insurance?
-20, 000!
- 20,000?
Isn't that ... a bit much? I can't...
It is a bit much, no?
Let's see what I have...
I have here... ten.
Fifty... Yes, fifty. Good?
But it's not enough.
It's not rich.
But with such a sum... I need to
exchange money or I'll be low.
Ok.
- Yes?
For the hospital.
Am I wrong for not giving more?
No, it's no problem, next time...
Look, I'll give more.
Give her another 5,000.
Give her...
Here is 2,000 more, ok? Here are 1,000...
Thousand. And... here!
Now it's allright, is it?
Still more. More.
Yes, but that's seven thousand...
fine, here's eight, but now
my wallet is empty.
I have to change.
Give her this and wish her good luck.
- Djambo.
- Djambo.
"Welcome, welcome..."
"Happy to see you, happy to see you..."
Welcome, welcome..."
Photo everyone?
And smile for me.
I wish you much power...
in your "Arbeit"... your work.
So you give her money?
Thank you very much.
More, more money.
I have not more.
- Give her more.
- I have not more.
- OK, thank you very much...
- Why very little?
Is too little?
But look, it's really empty.
I come back tomorrow, ok?
Stop it.
You disturb me, disturb me..
I disturb you?
Yes, I have many
things in my head.
What are you thinking?
Many things?
What do you think?
I tell you:
father is sick for a long time.
- Your father is sick?
- Yes, problems with heart.
I need money.
He think I am happy,
sitting here with you, kiss, kiss...
Me not happy.
Papa is sick.
- You need money?
- Yes...
I understand. I know.
I gave you money!
But not for papa.
But for the cousin, for the sister...
for the child of the sister,
now for papa.
You White women, 
you think me, uh, uh...
African people no spend much money.
I need money.
Stop touching me.
My father is sick,
and you give me no money.
Hello, I am waiting for your call.
Teresa. Please call back.
Djambo! You are the sister of Munga?
What do you want?
(Speaks Swahili)
- Is he here?
- No Munga, no Munga.
You don't know.
I don't understand you.
Munga, Munga, no.
- No Munga.
- No Munga, OK.
Need some money. Baby.
- Money?
- Money.
Better, better!
Here. Ok.
No Munga. Get out! Out!
I don't understand you. Bye.
No. No.
Teresa, come,
I tell you something about Munga...
I know, you are looking for Munga.
Follow me.
Why... how do you know Munga?
I know him, so you better follow me.
So that I tell you.
- You know Munga?
- Yes, I know. So follow me.
I don't love you.
But I really love you.
- Really?
- Of course.
Then leave me alone if you love me.
And stop saying all these
lies about Munga.
I know, you strongly desire love.
I can give you real love.
Munga is having fun with Kenyan woman.
Why don't you come with me?
Because I don't want to!
I will finish my beer and leave.
Give me a chance. I give real love.
Just once. Try it.
- We've tried it already, no, thank you.
- Right now. Today.
- No, thank you.
- I will give you.
I am good at... I think I'm caring.
- What? I don't understand.
- I am so concerned...
What? I don't understand.
I take care of you.
I care on you, instead of Munga.
What does that mean!
Speak correctly!
I mean, I'm concerned...
If you need love
If you need love - I can give you.
All you need from me, I will give you.
As long as you are mine.
But I don't want it.
Why? Come and listen me.
You are just jealous, that's all!
- No, I am not jealous!
Please. Let's go to my place,
my house.
I will give you all love.
- No.
- No.
- Why?
Why "why not"? Enough!
Don't say no.
- I don't like you.
I don't like you.
- I know you love me, but...
Don't be so arrogant!
What's this "I know I love you"?
- I know you love me.
- No, not true.
- My feelings tell me so.
- How can you know what I want?
Nobody knows what I want.
So tell me: where is Munga right now?
Where is he?
He'll come. So what?
- He's gone!
- It's not your business! Understand?
- I told you.
- What did you tell me?
- Give me chance.
- No chance.
Then I show you the really love.
What for Munga?
Munga already have two childrens!
What love can be there left?
- Djambo.
- Djambo.
Now like this, all together.
One, two, three, four...

Djambo, Bwana! How are you?
I am very good.
Welcome to Kenya.
Akuna Matata!
Djambo!
Oh you bastard! 
So that's your your "sister"??
Sister, you say?
That's your wife!
Your wife, you bastard!
I'll show you!
Look at me!
Look at me, you coward!
Look at me!
Look at me!
1! 2! 3!
4! 5! 6!
And now piss off!
Piss off!
- Please forgive me ...
- Piss off!
- Hello.
- Hello.
I do want no safari, I don't want no
village tour, I don't want a little diving tour...
I want to welcome you to Kenya.
My name is Salama.
Hi Salama.
- How is everything?
- Good.
- You are from which country?
- Austria.
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes.
Thank you.
How much?
The pack?
- No, just one.
- Nothing at all.
How much really?
Akuna Matata.
Free? Or 100 shillings?
Thank you, Salama.
Akuna Matata, Teresa.
Super!
Number five.
How many women have been in this bed?
How many white women?
In this bed ...
White women?
- No.
- Tell me the truth.
That is the truth.
You're beautiful.
I like the way you dress.
I have received a call from my family.
There is a problem.
- A call?
- Yes.
My brother was driving a motorbike
and he had an accident.
- An accident?
- Yes.
On the highway? Your brother?
Your brother had an accident? When?
Today. Now.
And?
Friends took him to hospital,
but he is jobless.
He has no money.
Honey, it's mama.
Did you forget my birthday?
I wrote you twice.
And you did not answer.
I'm fine. It's beautiful here.
Kisses. Bye.
There are camels here on the beach.
That's it, bye-bye.
Hello? Yes, it's mama.
You did not call.
You probably have no money?
I know it's late, but still -
it's my birthday.
I hope you're well.
Everything's good here.
I've got monkeys right on the balcony.
Baby, I miss you.
Love, kiss. Bye!
Happy birthday to you!
Dear Teresa, Happy Birthday!
He's all yours!
Go ahead, blow!
- Blowing's your job now!
He is all yours,
from head to dick.
Best of the best.
Happy birthday!
Prost! Cheers!
"Nazdarovye" and all that.
Now, take a look at your gift.
Now a toast to you, 
and to love.
Sit down and get ready!
Take off your shoes
and put them under the bed.
- And what will he do?
- Be patient.
On the bed, on the bed!
Make the music.
"You can leave your hat on."
You like him?
That's just the beginning.

Be glad you don't have to be in his shoes.
Look at this ass!

And what a cute dick!
Take a picture!
Not so close.

Turn around!
He does not understand.
Well, it isn't that large.
You want to dance African dance?
Come here.
Untie it with your teeth.
With your teeth!
I'll snap a picture!
- She can't get it off.
Don't strangle him!

The other one.
One, two, three ... four!
Mombasa Express.
Animalistic animation!
Now, let's make him hard.
Who gets him up - wins!
Screw it.
Get up! Go ahead!
Nothing happens.
I pass.
I pass!
I'm too old and ugly.
Don't be stupid!
What have we always said?
It gets smaller and smaller.
Enough. 
Next. Your turn!
Take off your bra.
Zero! I am telling you...
he is probably gay.
Well? - Nothing.
It should be hard by now.
Wow, you do it better than him!
Didn't we use some carbon acid last time?
I am winning! I am winning!
Yeah, it seems so!
Let's do a threesome, come on!
Still nothing happening? -
No, nothing!
Like a snake!
Like a snake!
Look at that!
- I've had it before.
Haven't we got any paper?
Look, a supressed White woman!
Now, that looks tasty.
Are you jealous?
I remember that part.
My Musa, my Musa...
Look how he screws. Like a monkey.
No, a tiger.
Can I put it in?
No, that costs more...
Are you crazy?
Put it in?
I'd say 10,000 if he jerks off.
Hey! She told you 10,000
if you make it yourself!
No, 1000. Sorry, I was wrong.
He's hard. I won!
At least he's half-way.
- Where, where?
Go and ride him, Teresa,
it's your birthday!
Even my Kurt would get half-way hard.
How could he possibly get hard?
Looking at my droopy boobs?
Now I have undressed mine... bomp!
Sorry, this is enough, ok?
You go, I pay you, and then...
- Thank you very much.
- Bye-Bye.
No hard-on?
Not until hell freezes over.
We'll take another one
with a hard-on guarantee .
We need a hard-ons.
We need one, two, three, four... hard dicks.
Take your things.
- Put your clothes on.
I will terribly miss him.
So we said...?
You have everything?
Thank you very much.
Come on, Josphat.
Josphat?
- Yes.
Key!
Yes!
You go in there and take a shower.
Make the light, you understand.
You take a shower.
Here is the... yeah?
You take the soap.
This is a good soap.
And then you wash your hair
with this, ok?
When you're ready - you knock.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Joseph?
Take a shower!
Shower! Water!
Joseph? Come here.
Sit here.
- Have you ever got a white lady?
- No.
Do you want to touch a white lady?
- No? Yes?
- Yes.
Do you want to touch me?
Here?
Give me your hand.
Put it here.
And on the other side.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
Do you want to kiss a white lady?
- Do you want to kiss me?
- Yes.
Or am I too old for you?
You're not.
You can kiss me if you want.
- Did you ever kiss a white lady?
- No.
Okay.
Can you sit down on the end of the bed?
Can you kiss my .... toes?
Up... up.
The other one...
Up...
and now in the middle.
That's not the middle.
Do you know, like this?
No.
You'll learn it.
I will show you. I will teach you.
I can't used to it.
You don't want?
It's not that I don't want.
I am not get use of it.
You can try.
It's hard for me.
- Because I'm old?
- No, you are not old.
Try it.
No, I can't get used of it.
You don't want.
It's not that I don't want.
Try it.
No. I can't.
I can't.
Okay.
Well? 
You can't?
No, I can't.
You can sit.
And get out. Get out of here!
Quick!
And don't take the money out of my bag!
Come on, hurry up!
You can do it outside.
