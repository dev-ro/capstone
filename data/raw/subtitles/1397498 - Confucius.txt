Retyped on Confucius TS English hardsub
I have grown old
It's so long since I last dreamed of master Zhu
My ideas of educations, musics, humanity and harmony
Can be fullfilled only in times to comes...
Master Kong Qiu, the mayor of Zhong Du
Indeed!
Follow me
Master Kong, you may bow inside
Announcing Master Kong Qiu, the mayor of ZhongDu
His Majesty arrives
Welcome, Kong Qiu...
Your humble servant Kong Qiu
glad too greets Your Majesty
Ok, Kong Qiu
As I heard
you've been mayor of ZhongDu
for only in a year, many things..
has been changed... Streets were safes,
homes were secures
Your majesty
As I said of observing the ritual of Zhou
"A year show progress, there years would
show much more"
I would like to see
Your policies applied througout
the Kingdom of Lu
I have no such authority, and therefore
shouldn't exert myself
This could be easily handle
I'll appoint you to the right position
Lord Ji Yiru has just died
Now, his oldest son Ji Sunsi
has become Prime Minister and Chief General
of the Army
But the post of Minister of Law is vacant
"There nobles family" all their own nominees
But I'm inclined to appoint you
I can't presume to be worthy
then I will support you
You and your disciples
could civilize the Kingdom of Lu
You could challenge those
you've called unworthy in the past
Do you dare?
My Lord, A slave has just escaped!
What? Who is it?
It's master PingZi
late lord's favorite young servant
He is Qi Sigong!
That little boy
My father ordered that
this boy must be buried with him!
Get him back!
Yes
Overthere! Prepare poisoned arrows now!
Help! Master! Master ... help me, please!
Teacher, in your opinion
could the kingdom of Lu stronger
but the emulating the Dukedom of Qui?
Your majesty
The people of Qi obey the law
Out of their fear of punishment
If we respect the law because of
we are civil, honest,
and have integrity, dignity,...
aren't this much better
when horrorable and credible men are choosen
to be officers
theft and corruption would disappear
men who cares their parents and children
also care for others
Men should perform their duties
while women would be given a home
and family ...
then orphan and widows, the old, the sick
and the weak could be taken care of
Then the people will live and work cheerfully
Universal peace and harmony will reign!
Mother!
?
Don't close it! Open the door!
Let me out, please!
Prepare the meal
Your father has returned
How do you know?
I heard his voice
He'll be surprised I've brought you
to see him
Hurry, take and bring this to him
Father
You're back
You've been gone for half of the day!
Mother and I have been waiting
You haven't eaten yet? You must be hungry
Don't be worry, who are you?
I am ...
Qi Sigong
Little boy..
Teacher
Yan Hui, call a doctor, quick!
Yes
Hurry, call for a doctor
What's this all about?
Teacher
as I came here
the troops of Ji Family were chasing
this little slave
So i rescured him
He was a burial-slave
The Ji's troops want him back
Teacher, let's avoid trouble
I can leave him with my brother in law
in the Kingdom of Wei
This might be better for everyone
No, Zilu, he could stay here
Seeing injustice and do not extend help
equal to a lack of courage
Then, Lord Ji Sunsi will be furious
Zilu
You did the right thing
Stop! What do you thing you're doing?
Who are you?
I am General Gong Sang Niu of Biyi cidatel
Quickly search this area
Mr. Gong San
Teacher
Kong Qiu
What do you want?
It is reported
That the Minister's escaped slave
is hiding here
If you don't show him over to us now
it may damage your relation
with the Minister
Minister Kong, may I have any words in private?
Minister Kong, I hate the arrogance of the
three Noble Families so much
And today, I could report that I found nothing
You and I should be friends and partners. Together.
we could drive out the Noble Families and
rule the kingdom ourselves.
Now, tell me
What say you
Our paths are different, so we cannot
work under the same principle
General, it's getting late,
you should be on your way
Go!
My lord and Ministers
Everyone has come to observe the Winter Sacrifice
But before we can begin
A strange occurrence demands explanation
Yesterday, the officer responsible for the
sacrifice of birds
reported that one of the ten pheasants
prepaired for the ceremony
has pecked off its own tail
So, today I must seek your exalted opinions
Ought we to cancel the ceremony?
Or make a delay?
I wish to speak
You can speak, Su Sunwu
In my opinion, since the Winter Sacrifice
marks the most important sacrifice at year end
it must not be delayed nor canceled!
We address the gods throught this ceremony
the omen reflects a message from Heaven
therefore, the pheasant should be set
to fly out from sacrifice
To do otherwise would be seen as a disrespect
for the Spirit!
We must obey the will of heaven
And allow this bird to live
Kong Qiu, what is your view?
Your Majesty
your humble servant fully agrees with
Minister Shu's opinion
Then ... you ministers?
Your humble servants also agrees
with the two minister's opinion
Since all are in agreement.
So be it! Let the pheasant be released
Into the mountain forests.
Your Majesty, your humble servant wished to speak
Speak
I have a request
at the end to the evil ritual of burial
of living being
with their deceased Master
Kong Qiu
Why do you have such respect?
Because today, your humble servant
Is pleading for this little slave's life
Which little slave?
There he is
Uncle
Ins't that the slave
who ran away from your home?
Kong Qiu
He was my family's slave
and you took him into your house!
How dare of you!
Teacher
Minister Ji, please pardon him
This boy should not accompany
Lord Ji Yiru to the grave
Don't you always approve of observing
our ancient traditions?
This is just one of them!
Minister Ji
Benevolence is love for our fellow human!
A ritual murder is still a murder even if they
comply with our tradition!
Lord Shu
You showed benevolence toward a pheasant
I am here to ask you
Surely you also to speakup for
this wounded boy?
Today, we come here
Only for discussing about the
Winter Sacrifice
This matter is unrelated
No, there is a close relationship!
The "Zhou Book of Ethic" tells us to value
a human life above all
the burial of slave was praticed in wicked ways
It was outlawed since the commencement of the Zhou
throne in this Dynasty
Our Kingdom of Lu is the ancient home
of the Duke of Zhu
And know for its ethic
We should be innovative with our system
and abandon outdated traditions
Your Majesty, everybody
I, Kong Qiu, on my own life
I ask you spare this young slave
Kong Qiu
It was Lord Yiru's dying wish that
those he loved should be die with him
It is not cruel to bury this slave
Rather, it demonstrates the Prime Minister's
filiat piety, and his love to his father
General Gong, I know
You served Lord Yuri for years
I heard he said many times that
he could not live without you
Yeah! That's right.
Given how close you were to him
he must still need you that
he has passed to the next life
If you were willing to accompany
your lord in death
I could not object you to taking
this little slave with you
You
Can you say anything?
You! Bastard!
It seems the General is not willing to serve
his master beyond the grave
He imposes on others what he will not
impose on himself
Your Majesty, I have no more to say
The scholar's words seem to be profound
I decide
Approved, release him
Great! You will never have to back
to the Ji's house
Second bow
Boy... Don't cry, stand up
Qi Sigong. What's wrong?
Are you okay?
I am not crying
May I really stay here?
Alright now, today is a special day
Zilu, let's get some drink
Good! Ziqian, Boniu, help me fetch the wine
Boy, come here
This is now your home
All of them are your brothers
They will take care of you
I know, teacher.
So we're family now
Teacher, I could hardly believe it
when Minister Ji accepted your proposal
Here comes the wine
Come.
What about you?
I have this
Drink all you like. Very well. Cheer!
It tastes horrid
Your Highest
Making Kong Qiu a Minister with
lots of responsibility
with surely strengthen the Kingdom of Lu
And their strength threaten us
in the Dukedom of Qi
Lu's strength is a threat to Qi
??????
For almost one hundred years
All rulers of Qi have dreamed of..
..conquering Lu
and clearing our way to the western border
Kong Qiu has already asserted his authority
in the Lu court
Your Highest, perhaps we should celebrate
a meeting
to congratulate Lu
We could invite the King of Lu and Kong Qiu
to meet at our border
Kong Qiu is a man of literature and not
familiar with military affairs!
He knows about Ethics, not bravery!
During the ceremony, we'll take the King of Lu
as hostage
then we could discuss how the ruler end
the three Noble Families can submit to Qi's will
???????
What an excellent proposal!
Minister Li, prepare a formal invitation to
The King of Lu
About having a meeting in Jiagu on forming
an alliance between the two kingdoms.
despatch immediately
Yes
This meeting at Jiagu
is my first challenge as a minister
It is a matter of honor or humiliation,
win or lose
And it would have significant consequence!
Yan Hui
His Majesty agrees that you should
take charge of the ceremony
ensure that both parties have equal ground
and no disrespect would be allowed
Yes, teacher.
Zilu
Teacher
You and ZiGong will be the only men to carry swords
on the meeting platform
Guard His Majesty carefully, regardless of what happeneds
Understood!
Ran Qiu
Teacher
Go in advance to Jiagu
to inspect the area around the meeting platform
seek out any places
What do you want me to do, teacher?
Teacher, the military commanders are here
Our respects, Minister of Law
Ok.
Qi specified the place for the alliance talks
It was known as a mountain ravine
a dead end
I would like to bring chariots nearby
in case we need them
Minister, we're based in a barrack
We have only carriages at our command,
and no war chariots
Minister Ji and
General GongShan Niu control them all
Minister
I heard the Prime Minister and Genernal Gong
are holding an archery tournament in Biyi
Very well
Then I would have to visit them there!
Teacher, we're approaching Biyi
Teacher, it is said that Biyi cidatel
has more mounted soldier and slaves
than any other city of Lu
Be advised
those who shriked labor within three days
will be dragged out and put on public display
Complete at what?
Archery
Please
The meeting between Lu and Qi
is a serious matter
Can your Lordship provide army chariots
to protect our king?
To show our might
How many?
500 chariots
Isn't it supposed to be an alliance meeting?
Why do you neet suck a show of force?
As Duke of Zhou taught us
Must backup Words with Force
Qi is a barbarous country
which has long wanted to conquer Lu,
so we must be prepaired
We must be prepaired!
Good
Let us have a match
My teacher respectfully request a match
and drink to you
If you win, I'll grant you
500 chariots
The archery match will begin
Please get in the shooting area
You have my word
If you win, they're yours
If you lose, you'll get nothing
Agreed
A pure heart
makes a pure shot
Right, full score
A new minister with high ambitions
Who would thought BiYi cidatel walls
were more than 18 feet high?
Built to conceal their injustices
use violence to control them
the tyranny within these walls
put tigers into shame!
Prime Minister, has all this escaped your notice?
Now, Master Ji
May I ask how Lu stands today?
it might that the Ji Family's real enemy
is from within
not across the border
I hear you had no father
Who taught you the shooting skill?
My father was a warrior, but he left this world
before his time
A diligent student needs no teacher ...
I learned myself
Good
Right wins
Thanks Prime Minister
So you need 500 chariots
for the alliance talks
Ask him yourself, General Gong.
We have a kingdom because we have an army!
Who raised and trained that army?
Not your King of Ly, It was my BiYi cidatel!
Why could I turn over my chariots to you?
So that you can process my army into the dessert
and famish them!
See again!
You see, my words don't necessarily count
I will give you the order
But
you have to figure out the rest by yourselves
Teacher
Halt
Your Majesty! Teacher!
Greetings, Your Majesty and Teacher.
Have General Gong's army moved or not?
I don't know what happened
Not one soldier or horse has moved yet
But... that can't be correct?
Ji Sunsi ordered them
But why didn't they follow us?
Put our second plan into effect, immediately!
Yes
Go
Kong Qiu, Qi has brought so much cavalry
Is there anything to concern us about this?
Your Majesty, rest assured we've prepaired
Since Qi is host and Lu is guest,
we request that the Nobles of Qi descent to welcome...
Your Highest, you do not need to descent
We invite the King of Lu do ascent
Your Majesty
Lu is the guest and Qi is the host
The Zhou Ritual madate that Qi Nobles should descent
Qi is the Head of the Alliance
How could we dishonour our guest?
Your Highest, Qi and Lu share a close retationship
Our ruler has come to rebuild
our brotherly alliance
Please
Please..
Please
It is our desire to respect each other
and forever abandon war
Although the two kingdoms don't share the same
surname
but we are like the brother
After this alliance
the two countries are like one
What Master Li said is interesting
All the people in the whole world is one family
the ministers and officers are just the servants
of our kings
Therefore, both of you excellencies
have the responsibility to protect
our Emperor Zhou's dynasty
Excellencies, your humble servant advised
When this alliance is formed
Each state must commit to aiding the other
Should Qi oneday find itself at war
Lu would be asked to provide 500 chariots
to supplement our army
Excellent ideas!
Excellencies
Your humble servant would also like to make a request
An alliance between us
should be found on sincerity
We have a request!
The return of the Three Cities of Whenshang ...
won from Lu 30 years ago in war
Let me think about request
Your Majesty
Your Majesty
A gentlemen's word is golden, your highest
Thanks for returning our land to us,
let's drink to it
Kong Qiu, it seems that you and your Master
have no a plan to leave here today
Take a look
Yan Hui
Your Highest
Today, we come here in peace
We only brought 10 chariots with us
But to safeguard the negotiation from
any unforeseen threats
another 500 more chariots are waiting nearby
Need we summon them here?
Take a look!
Your Majesty
the advance party is here
500 chariots are following me to Jiagu
We await your order
Minister Li
Do you want to see this ravine run in blood?
If this is the way you demonstrate friendship
as a head of an alliance
who will ever again trust the Dukedom of Qi?
Why are you still standing here?
Dismiss the troops!
King of Lu
King of Lu
Please forgive my minister's shameful act
May the alliance between us lasts forever
We make use of 100 ox carts
to scare off Qi's 500 chariots
Another triump for our teacher
Teacher has always said
"Military planning need to be innovative
and comes with surprise"
Come on, there are drinks waiting for us.
Our lady!
What? Has she gone missing again?
Sir, the prince has stormed into the palace
and is arguing with His Majesty again
Our Lady can't be found anywhere
She was not here!
Then what can we do?
This is awful!
Ok, Let's go back
Go
Father, I'm almost forty!
I have been prince for almost 20 years
You are getting old
and our kingdom is stagnating
But you just won't let go, will you?
Kong Qiu in Lu has a saying
"Women and servants are hard to educate"
But how could you allow a woman
to be involved in state affair and control it
Madam, you are back ...
Your Majesty
What so important that the prince need to see you
such in a hurry!
There's a message from General GongShan Niu
I wasn't asking you!
This GongShan Niu, he is an army general
For the Ji family in Lu
He wants to know
If we give him refuge in our kingdom
So Wei is to become a heaven for cast-off now?
That's exactly why i din't approve
GongShan Niu is ready to serve us
Why can't we give him refuge?
Giving him refuge would give no benefit
to the Kingdom of Wei
GongShan Niu has served the Ji family for many years,
anh the Late Ji Yiru was good to him
Not only the BiYi cidatel was granted to him,
taxes were exempted for years
And now he turn his back on his Boss
What use to have for a turncoat like that?
I could control him
Learn to control yourselves first!
The kingdom of Lu and Wei depend on each other
for their survival
If we took GongShan Niu
wouldn't we offend Lu?
Have you forgotten?
The mighty Kingdom of Jin is to our west
and the rough Kingdom of Chu is to the South
We have enemy on four sides!
If we lose our main ally
What then?
Get out
Next time, do not ...
If there's a next time
you'll no longer be the prince of Wei
The prince can't even weigh up gains and losses
How can I make him the regent?
Invite Kong Qiu here
to teach your prince
Then Wei will be safe
Your Majesty
please write a formal invitation to Master Kong.
Do you think Kong Qiu would come?
Master Kong's talents are not recognized
the three Noble Families in Lu
keep his talent in check
Our invitation will be seen as an application
of his talent
If he comes, that's great!
If he doesn't
Lu will put him to better use
Lu will prosper, and will bring Qi to heel
That will suit us too...
What is this?
Two invitations from both Wei and Qi
We should start using Kong Qiu better
or others will take him
So how should we make use of his talents?
One moment..
This Kong Qiu has no proper line of ancestry
Your Majesty gave him a role in court less than
a year ago
First he was the mayor of ZhongDu
Then he was appointed Minister of Law
And now we're supported to promote him even higher?
Does Your Majesty plan to make him a living god?
At the Lu-Qi alliance meeting ...
...Kong Qiu regained territory
and enhanced our national prestige
The whole country praise him for that
Kong Qiu was born a commoner,
however your father had admitted
He is an offspring of a Song noble family.
He won back the Three Cities
without using a soldier or chariot
He may be a mere commoner
but his idead of civilty in government works!
When my father died.
Kong Qiu was made the Minister of Law
Now I could vacate
the post of Interior Minister for him
when the emperor approves,
I would only serve as the Prime Minister
Very well!
I am glad our Prime Minister respects talents as much
Good
This is wonderful
It is the time for talents
when countries are in turmoil
Besides Kong Qiu
most of his disciples are available
to serve our country
Master Kong, this is an outdated tradition.
The servant I dispatched to the palace has
reported secretly
Minister of the Interior Kong Qiu
is not focusing on government work
He has been busy to building the Wuzi high platform
He claimed the platform is built
to protect us from flooding, didn't he?
Yes, that is what he said
I do not trust him and
I think he has other things in mind
Kong Qiu is a mere commoner
The Majesty already appointed him as
the Minister of Law
Now he has also appointed him to be the
Acting Interor Minister
Uncle, there has to be a conspriracy here
He dit not ... did not eat again
Cut off your tongue if you stammer again
Out!
Yes
Zhongni, I've made some new black ink for you
It won't be easily washed off,
let try it.
Very well
Teacher, the petition is ready.
Please take a look.
Fine!
Gong Boliao, ready the cart
It's so late! Where are you going?
It is urgent, I need to go to the palace.
Wake up! Gong Boliao
Do not disturb me
Rotten wood is hard to be carved,
let him sleep.
You have been working all day, even at midnight
This is hard
If this is for the betterment of Lu's citizen,
I don't mind
Teacher
you're ordering city walls to be demolished
Won't the Three Noble Families rebel
Against your authority?
It is time for razing the power of these There Families
If we raze, do it quickly
Teacher, I think it would be dangerous to do so
YEs Teacher, it really dangerous
You should consider it once more
Consider what?
Disciples, my late teacher Master ZiChan
had two fine sayings
Please remember them all your life
"Put your country ahead yourselves
"Yes, as an officer the burden is heavy, the road is long
"So maintain your strength of spirit"
What we are doing now
is not only for the short term
Minister of the Interor Kong Qiu is here to see His Majesty
Tomorrow in court,
I will call for "Razing the Three City Walls"
"Razing"? What exactly does that mean?
When the Duke of Zhou ruled these lands,
it was established ...
that no fiefdom should build walls
around its city higher than 18 feet in height
The aim was to prevent the nobles
from abrogating power to themselves
But in recent decades,
these three noble families have turned their cities
to be their own
...so have their city walls grown taller
I humbly propose that the walls
of these three cities be razed
and to break the separatis
That is a serious matter
It will stir up discontent
Could you win this?
If you fail
you'll unleashed chaos everywhere
Your humble servant did a fortune reading
The reading was "Headless Dragon"
That is very auspicious
To strengthen the throne, the power of the
nobles must be reduced
we must cut off the dragon's head
Serve my man here with the best wine and meal
Thanks Minister, thank you
Didn't I say this would happen?
It is vicious
Razing the city walls
To pull down our walls to undermine our strength!
Kong Qiu want to bring down the Three Noble Families
Our fieldoms?
Have we any fieldoms?
May be Meng's fieldom still become to Meng
Your fieldom belongs to you or General Hou Fan?
Is BiYi still mine?
Kong Qiu want to demolish them
Fine! That would be benefit us
Uncle, what should we do now?
Laozhi taugh us
If we want to gain,
we must first give out something!
We may support Kong Qiu
raze there city walls!
More speed
We must reach BiYi tonight
to see General Gongshan Niu
Come on! Peck it!
Urgent Report from the city of Houyi
Acting Interior Minister
Just speak
Yes sir
Hou Fan, Rebel General of Shusun Wu's terrorist
has escaped from Houyi
The armies of Shusun and Zigao
have teared down their walls successfully
Excellent! Well done.
Good, we caught them by surprise
The Minister must be congratulated on
his famous victory!
Come, drink.
today we must celebrate
No, it's not over yet
Hou Fan will continue his resistance
Minister, then ensure that Shusun and Zigao
tear down their walls quickly
or the rebels will regroup behind them!
As I arrived in the city,
I saw Zilu and his army encamped nearby
Your BiYi is about to have its walls torn down,
you need a plan
They can come and tear down the walls,
then the Capital would not be protected
My plan is to take over the capital,
execute Kong Qiu and banish
the Three Noble Families!
Stop!
We want to check the carts
Don't you recognize the Ji's banner?
We are delivering the land taxes from Biyi
to the Palace
Open the gate!
The Minister of Law has ordered that all carts
be inspected
Seize the Duke of Lu, Slay Kong Qiu!
Seize the King, slay Kong Qiu,
banish the three noble families
Kill'em all
Report, General Gongshan,
the King is not at the Palace now
Where is he?
it seems he sought refuge with the Ji Family
Find the King!
Open the gate! Open it!
In such a key moment, where is Minister Ji?
He's out for a hunt. Your Majesty, follow me please
Your Majesty, be careful
Don't go head on with them, still for 2 hours
Steer the rebels to the Wuzi Platform
Yes sir
Ji surely pick a good time for a hunt
Quick! Kill'em all
King of Lu, Kong Qiu, Three Noble Families,
hear this...
Today, in the name of the Lord Ji Yiru,
under heaven mandate
I will clean up all those that go againts
the will of heaven
Destroy them!
March on!
Seize the King, slay Kong Qiu
Retreat
Pull
Release
Report, Minister!
Gongshan Niu and his rebels were defeated and
is retreating from the capital
Uncle, urgent report from the capital
it's just as you estimated
Gongshan Niu was defeated at the Wuzi Platform
Then what are you waiting for?
Send the troops in capture GongShan Niu alive
Yes
Take Gongshan Niu alive
Pull
Pull
Release
Pull
Release
No body is demolishing my Ghengyi
Why?
Chengyi stands right on the border
between Qi and Lu
The fort with high walls is used to protect us
against the invasion of Qi
it must not be demolished
How could you break your own words?
Didn't you approve to raze the high walls
of our three noble families is the first place?
Let him finish
Kong Qiu has reclaimed the three cities of Wen Shang
The three cities which used to belong to your family
But were they returned to you?
No, they now belong to the Duke of Lu
In this campaign, Kong Qiu has removed General Hou Fan
from the city of Houyi
Then who has become the Governor of Houyi?
Zigao, Kong Qiu's disciple
and BiYi, has it been returned
to your family?
No, and you have nothing.
Zilu, a disciple of Kong Qiu, was now appointed
as the Governor of BiYi
See?
Now if they're going to take over my Chengyi
they would again to give it to the Duke of Lu
Will there be any land or city left to us?
You ministers
Are you really willing to give the kingdom
back to the Duke of Lu and Kong Qiu?
