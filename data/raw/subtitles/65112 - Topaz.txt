(Inaudible)
What shall we do now?
(Loud Traffic Noise)
(Gulde) Well, ladles and gentlemen,
It's tlme that we start.
Wlll you be klnd enough
to follow me?
What I'm golng to show you

Up here, I can show you a detall
In the productlon
whlch we're rather proud of showlng.
As you see,
flowers are modelled petal by petal,
and thls Is an art whlch has survlved
at the factory for almost 200 years.
And you wlll see the garland there
that takes two days to complete.
As you see, the flowers are modelled
petal by petal,
and stamen by stamen.
Even In very small flowers, you can
flnd as many as 10 to 15 stamens.
The flgurlne you see
belng ornated wlth flowers
was flrst made as a glft from
Danlsh women to our late klng.
Please follow me further up here.
As we move further down here,
I can show you the palntlng.
If you can move around here, I thlnk
that everybody wlll be able to see.
Perhaps you could come a blt closer
and have a look
at how thlngs are palnted.
And now we can proceed to the next
department. Please follow me here.
(Inaudible)
(Figurine Shattering)
I'm sorry.
- You can dial the number yourself.
- Thank you.
Miss Kusenov. Where's your father?
Oh.
Fine. All right, now. Listen to this.
Do you know a department store
here called Den Permanente?
Den Permanente. That's it.
It closes at 5:30. I want you and your
parents to be shopping there at 5:15.
Now, as soon as you arrive there,
be aware that we will be outside.
(Gulde) Please follow me farther...
(CIosing Bell Ringing)
(Cycle Bell Ringing)
Aaaargh!
Tamara!
Oh!
(Tyres Screeching)
Get your heads down, quick.
All right. They've gone.
(Gasping And Sobbing)
(Tamara) Ahl
Go right up.
Thank you.
- Are you all right now?
- It was very clumsy, this operation.
- What?
- In front of the store. Very clumsy.
- Well, you got away, didn't you?
- We wouldn't have done it like that.
(Engines Rewing)
- Over...
- Will you contact Wiesbaden?
Ask them how long a wait there'll be
on that C135 to Washington.
This is Mr and Mrs Kusenov
and their daughter Tamara.
- Mr McKittreck and Mr Blake.
- Madame.
Would you come this way, please?
Well, what's he like?
He's a darling man. You'll see.
He's what you wanted.
He's a big one
They must be raising hell
in Moscow.
Is that the White House?
The Capitol Building.
The seat of government.
I'll show you the White House
further along.
There it is.
It's nice.
- Morning, Howard.
- Good morning.
This is where you'll live, for a while.
Come along.
Good morning.
What is this?
We'd like you to be comfortable here.
If there's anything we can...
- Is it your house?
- No, but I'll be here quite often.
We would like you
in here for a few minutes.
- Please, if you don't mind.
- All right.
(McKlttreck) All three of you.
- Why?
- I beg your pardon?
It isn't necessary for them.
- All three of you, one at a time.
- Mrs Kusenov, please.
- What's the matter, Mike?
- Couldn't that wait till tomorrow?
Why?
They've had a rough 24 hours.
They need to relax.
Didn't they relax on the plane?
I always do.
Here he Is.
- Hm?
- Devereaux.
- Good. I ask you not to be difficult.
- Then let him show some respect.
Respect is something he rarely shows.
As second-in-command...
I'm not such an imbecile
that he has to tell me what to say.
- Oh, no.
- No, no!
- I don't need him at military meetings.
- You do.
I'm sorry. You've been here
from Paris only a few months.
He has been here several years.
Then he is too close
to the Americans.
I agree. But the closeness has value.
He's built up the best intelligence
network in the western hemisphere.
He's very expert,
and he's a dedicated man.
And I too sometimes wish
that he would show some respect.
- (Intercom Buzzing)
- (Woman) Mr Devereaux Is here.
- Yes. Let him come in.
- Yes, slr.
Good morning, d'Arcy.
- Good morning, General.
- We received a message from Paris.
A high Russian intelligence official
defected to the Americans.
- How long ago?
- We don't know.
Why didn't you know about this?
Because the Americans
didn't tell me.
How did Paris know about this?
Did the Russians tell them?
It's peculiar, don't you think?
A Russian intelligence officer
defects,
and someone in Moscow rushes over
to the phone and calls someone in Paris.
Who? Why?
- What?
- No, André.
How Paris got its information
is not our concern.
We've been asked to find out
where the defector is.
- Why?
- Huh?
What will Paris do
once we have found out?
- Pass the information to Moscow?
- André!
- Two men will arrive to liquidate him?
- What are you trying to say?
Nothing, General.
I just wonder
how Paris got the information.
Yes, that's right.
He's here. I'll tell him.
These are six classified
top-secret documents of NATO.
- I am an authority on NATO.
- That's what you keep telling us.
We want to know which of them
crossed your desk in Moscow.
This one.
This one.
This one.
They are fakes. Those two.
To see if I really know. To test me.
You are childish. These are fakes.
When did you become
a deputy chief of the KGB?
This is of no concern to you.
- We'd like to decide that.
- No, I will decide.
What do you think you're here for?
I asked for sanctuary and protection
for myself, my wife and my child.
- And you got it.
- But I gave you no understanding.
Look. The way you're going,
you may find yourself on the steps
of the Russian Embassy.
And that would be the end for me.
But you would never get
another defector.
(Phone rlngs)
Colonel Kusenov, does the word
"topaz" mean anything to you?
- In what context?
- Just the word "topaz".
- (Kusenov) It's a gem used In jewellery.
- (Agent) In Intelllgence matters?
- Where have you seen this word?
- (Agent) What does It mean to you?
- It's for you, Mike.
- Right.
(Kusenov) Nothing.
You've never used it, or heard it used?
Topaz as a code word?
No.
(Man) General Kusenov, here Is a llst...
- Who is it?
- Your secretary.
Yes, Peggy, what is it?
From the French what?
André Devereaux?
What did he want?
Oh.
All right. Call him back and say yes
and find out what time.
- Right. See you later.
- What did he want?
He called and asked me to dinner.
Well?
I had dinner with him
only two nights ago.
Now... Why did you
suddenly ask Mike to dinner?
Because he adores your food.
And... you want something out of him.
I promise it'll be a short evening.
I wish we could go home to Paris. You
could have a job in the foreign office.
Who said so?
Claire d'Arcy.
- Diplomats' wives should not talk.
- All wives talk.
She said that you are
too involved with Americans.
D'Arcy is an ass.
André, you are French,
and not supposed to be mixed up
in this Cold War between
the Americans and the Russians.
- You are neutral.
- No-one is neutral.
I don't want you to be killed.
OK, I'm going.
And you two secret agents
can settle down and be secret agents.
I wish you wouldn't use such words,
my love.
Why? Who do you think
you are fooling, my master spy?
Everybody in Washington knows
you are not a commercial attaché.
Everybody in Washington knows
that the chief of Russian intelligence
is the chauffeur
who drives a car for...
Everybody in Washington
does not know these things.
And I would thank you
not to repeat them.
- Go to bed.
- Where did you hear that?
From my butcher.
I'll be glad when Michìle gets here
and I can talk to someone
not looking over his shoulder.
Oh, is your daughter
coming over from Paris?
Her husband's reporting
on the opening of the United Nations.
We are going to see them
in New York and have a holiday.
And we are not going to see
a single, solitary spy.
You might see a few
at the United Nations.
We are not going there.
Michìle and her husband are.
- We are going to have fun. Right?
- Right.
I seem to gather, Nicole, that you
don't care much for the work we do.
- How did you guess?
- You should be used to it by now.
The wife never gets used to it.
But I like you, Mike. For an
intelligence man, you are very nice.
Thank you. And thank you
very much for a beautiful dinner.
- Brandy?
- Yes. Thanks.
She wants you to quit.
Thinking about it?
No.
I understand
you have a Russian defector.
- What is his name?
- Boris Kusenov.
We have him at a safe house
outside Washington.
Don't you think I knew what I was
getting into when I was asked to dinner?
- Then why did you come?
- To tell you what you want to know.
Provided I don't pass
the information back on to Paris?
Mm-hm. McKittreck says I'm taking
a big chance. Am I?
Mike, you and I have done things
for each other
that no other agents
in this town would do.
And I'd like to keep it that way.
Colonel Kusenov, we'd like to know
all you can tell us about Cuba.
Cuba.
The technicians.
The Russian technicians in Cuba.
- How many are there?
- I estimate 4,500.
By now, possibly 5,000.
- Military?
- Military, civilian.
Construction crew.
Mostly, technical and electronic
experts of the highest order.
What are they doing there?
They came bearing gifts
from Russia to Cuba.
- What kind of gifts?
- The KGB is carefully divided.
Cuba was never in my field.
I cannot give you facts.
- Damn it!
- You made an agreement with me!
Yes, I know. I made my bargain
with the devil for facts.
Yes, I will tell you
where you will find your facts.
There is a Cuban named Rico Parra.
You know him.
A leader of the government.
In the movement from the beginning.
Correct.
He was in Moscow for conferences
and flew to New York as head
of the Cuban delegation to the UN.
I met him in Moscow.
- What were the conferences?
- To draw up an agreement.
Or call it a trade pact.
Or call it an alde-memolre.
An agreement
between the Soviet Union and Cuba.
Setting down exactly
what the Soviet Union
is now supplying,
and will supply, to Cuba.
Offensive weapons?
Have the Russians brought
offensive weapons into Cuba?
I told you, I cannot give you facts.
But Rico Parra has the trade pact.
He has the alde-memolre.
It's all there for you to read...
if you can obtain it.
Who else might handle
these papers, besides Rico Parra?
You have become smart.
Yes. There is another man.
Luis Uribe. Rico Parra's secretary.
- He is a security risk.
- How do you know?
I have used him.
The Cubans don't know.
He can be bought,
but he is of no use to you.
- Why?
- He hates Americans.
Does he hate American money?
He would never take it from an American.
You can believe me.
So now I have given you
my information,
what will you do with it?
- Michìle!
- André!
- Mother!
- François!
- Hello, Francois.
- Hello, Father.
- You look wonderful.
- You too.
You've done something
to your hair.
Do you like it? He wants me to cut it.
- I like it.
- Agreed.
- When do you go back to Paris?
- In five days.
- Then we will stay five days.
- There is so much to see.
New York is marvellous.
And we will do it all.
(Indistinct Chatter)
Hello, Nicole. André.
I hope you don't mind
my dropping in.
I wanted to be sure the flowers
were in your room.
Michìle,
you remember Mr Nordstrom?
- Oh, yes.
- It's been a couple of years.
François Picard.
Michael Nordstrom.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
(Porter) The bags are all In, slr.
- André?
- Yes.
Thank you.
I understand you are here
for a Paris newspaper.
Yes. For the opening
of the United Nations.
François,
we have to change for dinner.
Oh, yes. Excuse me.
I do apologise, Nicole.
Thanks for the flowers, Mike.
Before you say, "What do you want?"
Or "Get the hell out,"
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to be.
You can't do this to Nicole.
- I have to, André.
- How did you find us?
You both told me you
were going to be in New York.
Never mind. What do you want?
There is a written agreement
between Russia and Cuba.
We must see it. Rico Parra...
- I can't talk to Parra. He hates me.
- I know that.
Rico Parra has a secretary
named Luis Uribe.
Why don't you do this job yourself?
We can't. Uribe can't be approached
by an American.
No.
I am sorry.
Just one of your people
to photograph those papers.
Just a taxi ride to Harlem,
that's all we're asking.
This Uribe can be bought.
André, do this for us.
You know I wouldn't be here
if there was any other way.
The sketches you made
at the United Nations.
- Did you do the Cuban delegates?
- Some, yes.
Did you make a sketch
of a man named Luis Uribe?
I'll see.
There he is.
Could we have this page?
Is it for a good cause?
I would hate to do it over.
- You'll get it back.
- OK, you can have it.
Could I ask you what this is about?
I am your son-in-law.
Also a newspaper man.
Take care of the women.
- I'll get to the Colony soon.
- You are going out?
Have your drinks.
I will try to get there before dinner.
- Tell Nicole not to worry.
- I'll let Michìle tell her.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
The money.
You understand? This can't have
anything to do with us.
If anything goes wrong,
it's your operation.
- I know.
- I'll head back to Washington.
- Will you call me tomorrow?
- Yes.
I would like to see Mr Dubois.
- Whom shall I say?
- Franco-American Finance Company.
Hello. Come In. Come In.
It's a long time
since you came yourself.
I have an urgent and vital job
to be done tonight.
- I hope you are free.
- I am always free for you.
Can we go into your office?
No, that is all open.
We had better go in here.
You might find it a bit chilly.
(Inaudible)
- You remember his name?
- Luis Uribe.
Why does he hate Americans?
I was told he lost his son
at the Bay of Pigs.
This is all pretty iffy. I won't have
much chance to organise anything.
- You just have to improvise.
- Oh, lots of luck!
- What about your camera?
- Always ready and loaded.
This way.
Be sure you let him know
you are French, not American.
Better than that.
I am from the island of Martinique.
- That makes us practically related.
- Good.
- Here is my little one.
- How do you propose to get up there?
I think I will be a reporter.
I am loaded with press cards.
Who do you think I ought
to work for tonight? Ebony?
- Playboy? Jersey Clty Post Ledger?
- Ebony.
I identify better with Playboy.
- Ebony.
- Oh, man, are you square!
OK. Let's go.
Oh! One tiny matter.
The money.
Benny, work on this cross,
and don't brighten it up too much.
I'll try not to.
(Cheerlng Crowd)
Where will you be?
Along here. Across the road.
- Watch yourself, Philippe.
- It's the best thing I do.
(Inaudible)
(Inaudible)
(Indistinct Spanish)
What do you want?
I have an appointment with
Senor Parra's secretary, Uribe.
Go ahead.
Oh, there he is now.
Thanks.
I said no. Now, go on.
Rico told me he would see us.
He told us he would see us
this morning.
I tell you tonight he will not.
Now, get out. Both of you.
- Who are you to tell us to...
- I said he will not see you.
- Rlco. It's me, Matteo Gomez.
- And Tomas Bosch.
- Rlco.
- Get out, both of you.
Where are those papers now,
exactly?
In a red leather case, on the floor
next to his desk. Locked.
If I get Parra away from his desk,
can you get the case and bring it here?
- He won't give you an interview.
- Then I've failed.
But I am not going to fail
in your bathroom. Come on.
Wait one minute.
- Who is he?
- It is all right, Hernandez.
- Please.
- Get out. Get the hell out of herel
Fools. Do you want
to get us all arrested? Get out.
But, Rico, you said you wanted
us to show that we are not afraid.
So you are going to bomb
the Statue of Liberty? Imbeciles.
- Get out!
- Senor Parra!
I wonder if I could have
a few minutes of your time.
Who are you?
Comrade Rico,
this man is from Ebony magazine.
If you wlll speak to hlm for a mlnute.
I give no more interviews.
What is the matter?
Are you anti-Negro?
Leave him alone.
There are no colour bars in Cuba.
We're a free and democratic nation.
All men... are comrades.
Then you will talk to me.
After what the American newspapers
said about us?
I am not the Amerlcan newspapers.
I would llke you to come out
on the balcony wlth me.
Let me photograph you
wavlng to our people.
To my people. Will you do that?
- What will you print about Cuba?
- Whatever you tell me.
One statement
to go with the pictures.
- What is this?
- This is my camera.
- It is a funny little camera.
- It does very good work.
(Cheerlng)
- How about one this way?
- Keep waving, please. Keep waving.
- I think you have had enough.
- Just two more, please. Two more.
(Phlllppe) Thank you, Senor Parra.
What do you want me to say
to go with the pictures?
Tell your people
we are a small country now.
But soon, very soon,
we will not be afraid of anybody.
- Not of anybody.
- Good. Then something is happening.
No, I did not say that.
- Only write what I say.
- Of course.
Thank you, Senor Parra.
- Comrade.
- Comrade.
Comrade.
Fernando. I want two copies of this.
Fernando. Where is the red case?
Uribe took it.
Uribe? Why? He has no key.
I have the only key.
Hernandez.
Have you got your gun?
Come with me.
Excuse me.
Give me your gun.
(Gunshot)
(Screaming)
(Gunshot)
Come with me!
(Police Whistles)
There he is.
Sorry, senor.
All right, Benny.
I'll finish it.
- Is it OK?
- It looks fine.
Does René d'Arcy know
that you are going to Cuba?
Yes, of course.
- Does Paris know?
- I assume so.
André, I don't want you to go.
I am afraid for you,
for your career, for your life.
I've got to. I promised. I started
all this and I am going to finish it.
Let the Americans
do their own dirty work.
They can't. They have no organisation
in Cuba since the Bay of Pigs.
All their agents are dead or in jail.
- And so they asked you?
- Yes.
It can be no-one but you?
I want it to be me.
Those papers we photographed
in New York scared the hell out of them.
Notjust the Americans. Me!
I have got to see what the Russians
are up to in Cuba.
There is a woman in Cuba,
isn't there?
Named... Juanita de Cordoba.
Where did you hear that name?
Where else? From Claire d'Arcy,
who got it from her husband,
who got it from your French office
in Havana.
I don't want that name used,
mentioned, ever.
Why? What is she to you?
She is in the Cuban underground.
She sometimes works for me.
What else does she do for you?
Nicole! She is the head
of the network in Cuba.
I shouldn't tell you. It is dangerous
to talk of her, even to know...
But I do know, that's the trouble.
I wish I didn't.
I know that you go to Cuba
four or five times a year.
And that... she is beautiful.
I go to Cuba four or five times
a year because it is my job.
That's all.
Now, I don't want to talk about it.
Will you come down with me?
Goodbye.
Nlcolel
You'd better wait.
I'll send the boy out. Give him
my overnight case and the typewriter.
And... take this... and the suitcase
in the back to the residence.
What time will you be in Havana
tomorrow?
I will call you
when to send a car for me.
- Juanita.
- Hello.
- Senor Parra.
- Monsieur Devereaux.
- You are back soon.
- I am always happy to return to Cuba.
- I am sure you are.
- And to come here to pay my respects.
- I am happy to see you, Juanita.
- Thank you.
Nylon things from the US.
I hope your government won't mind.
I didn't inform Customs.
And... how are things in Washington?
Routine. Nothing exceptional.
I was in New York
only 24 hours ago.
Oh? How were things in New York?
See any good shows?
No. Routine. Nothing exciting.
- Will I see you tonight?
- No, not tonight.
You'll be at the rally tomorrow?
- Fldel expects you.
- Mm-hm.
- Is there a rally tomorrow?
- Mm.
I would like to listen to Castro.
I am sorry
you can't be on the platform.
No, no, I like to be part of the crowd.
Mm-hm.
Senor Devereaux.
Get my things, will you?
Monsieur Vata knows which ones.
Yes, sir.
I am very glad to see you, sir.
- Please take those in for me, Tomas.
- Yes, senora.
You sent no word.
I tried to phone you from Mexico City
between planes. Didn't the office call?
Less than an hour ago.
When he was here.
You picked a hell of a time to come.
Security is tight.
- The island's crawling with Russians.
- I know.
I have come to take a look at them.
And what they're up to.
I haven't been able to send
any information to Miami in weeks.
Well, I am here now to do all I can.
So, Rico Parra is still your faithful
companion and protector?
And landlord.
Did he come to... collect the rent?
How is your wife?
- Maybe we ought to start again.
- I think we'd better.
I don't get this. The French don't give
a damn what the Russians do in Cuba.
- The Americans do.
- That's going to be tough.
Cuba is locked up.
The Russians have us like this.
I am going to need help
from your organisation.
No use.
Most of my people are in hiding.
The only thing you can do...
is stay with me for a few days.
Then go home.
Let's get down to business
of opening our present.
- Our present?
- Yes. Yours and mine.
- A radio?
- A Geiger counter.
This will tell us if the Russians
have brought in nuclear warheads.
- There is a tape recorder inside.
- Clever.
You will have to find out
what streets in Havana they use
to transport the missiles at night.
That's a job for Tomas.
And this one?
We have got lots of cameras.
Not like this one.
Remote-controlled.
You can put the camera
half a mile away.
- And take pictures of what?
- Missiles, of course.
At San Cristano? Oh, we'll never
get near there, darling. We've tried.
I will show how in the morning.
Now, the other things I need:
What units of Soviet troops are here,
any new types of aircraft.
And the caves.
Where are the biggest caves?
- The biggest ones are at Managua.
- Good.
Is that all?
I think so.
Oh, I nearly forgot.
A non-electronic present.
Oh, isn't that beautiful?
Thank you.
Let me show you how this works.
(Radioactive Static)
It's the radlum In the clock flgures
that Is causlng lt.
It is not yet ten o'clock and we have
done nearly a day's work.
That's organisation for you.
I showed Tomas what to do
with the typewriter.
I know. He will do the job.
And now you will go into Havana
and behave like
an innocent commercial attaché.
And you'll go to the rally
with your landlord.
- See you tonight.
- Adlos.
- Please sit down, Mrs Mendoza.
- We are leaving now.
No, sit down. Is everything ready?
This is the long-distance lens.
- Good.
- And look, senora.
Very good.
And here.
- Cover them up.
- All right!
We must make sure Pablo
does not eat the camera.
(Laughter)
Here, here, senora.
From here I can get a view of everything
going on in the port of Viriel.
- Aren't you too near the road?
- I promise you, it is safe.
Then here is your picnic.
Have a good time.
You will take care of Mrs Mendoza.
- God bless you.
- Thank you.
- Take care of your man.
- I will.
(Singing in Russian)
(Squawking Gulls)
Hey, Ricardo, take a look.
There is someone up there.
(Englne starts)
- It was a man and woman.
- Manuel, Enrique, Rafael.
You others, stay here.
- How long have you been here?
- Some time.
As you see, we are broken down.
Have any other cars gone by
in the last minute?
I saw one a few moments ago.
It went down the road.
- What kind of car?
- I thlnk It was a black one.
- Ricardo, it's them.
- Pablo! Pablo!
Carlottal
Take them.
- Senor, you are making a mistake.
- We don't know why you are taking us.
Follow us.
(Patriotic Music)
There is a man, the night the papers
were photographed in New York,
outside the Theresa Hotel.
Where?
- Are you sure?
- 100 per cent.
He... was as close to me then
as you are now.
Shall I... Shall I have him picked up?
No, not yet.
Well, it's understandable. After all...
May I join you for coffee?
Let me give you some dinner.
- Dolores?
- Just coffee, thanks. I've had dinner.
- Too bad. It is beautiful chicken.
- Oh?
Black market.
You might have phoned.
It was a sudden urge.
Senora?
Ask Tomas to bring some coffee
for Senor Parra.
- SI, senora.
- Please, sit down.
I have just come from having a long
talk with my ex-secretary, Uribe.
- You know Uribe?
- No.
- You know of hlm?
- No.
- Why did you dismiss Uribe?
- He turned out to be unsatisfactory.
He was persuaded to tell me
what I wanted to know
before he went on his journey.
Journey?
The journey from which
no traveller ever returns.
What had he done?
He was working for the French.
And they were working for the Americans.
So you had a sudden urge
to come here?
What does that have to do with André?
Just because he is French?
The night in New York when Uribe
gave documents to a Frenchman,
to photograph
inside the Theresa Hotel,
there was another Frenchman
outside the hotel.
- There may have been several.
- Hm.
But the only one
I give a damn about
is the one so conveniently knocked over
when the French spy escaped.
That was smart.
What's this about?
Were you in New York?
Yes. For fun.
You are putting two and two together
and getting eight.
What you learned from
the papers about Russia and Cuba
is why are you suddenly here.
And that makes nine.
I was In New York.
I dld go up to Harlem
to see the show you were puttlng on.
And... it was a very good show.
The rest is coincidence.
Now, this is what I came to tell you.
If it were not for her,
if it were not that it might involve
her, you would disappear tonight.
You would be with Uribe.
Your country would recelve
bewlldered apologles.
But you would never
be heard from again.
She is a widow
of a hero of the Revolution.
She is loved and honoured
in this country.
You are an Intelllgence agent.
Your association with her
can put her in great danger.
I want you out of the country on the
next plane, early tomorrow morning.
If you have been
collecting information
about what Russians
are doing in Cuba to help us,
don't think for one minute you will
take it out of here. You will not.
You will be searched
at the airport... completely.
And if anything is found on you,
you will be arrested.
And what can happen to you
after that
Is somethlng you know about.
Now, if you don't mind
cutting your dinner short,
I will take you back to Havana...
to pack your bags.
No, you will not take him
back to Havana. He is my guest.
He will have his dinner and enjoy
my company for as long as he pleases.
When he is ready
to go back into Havana,
he will phone
for a car to come and get him.
You are being a damn fool.
You have made up a story that
you want to believe, because of me.
I don't belleve he had any contact
wlth Urlbe.
I don't thlnk anyone else would.
If you are doing him any harm,
I will raise such hell...
And you know I can.
And next time you desire to drop in
on me like this, please telephone first.
Tomorrow morning.
(Knocking)
Come in.
I have brought the typewriter.
It is done.
- Good, Tomas.
- And a car is waiting for you.
May I show you?
When did the missiles
go through Havana?
Just before three in the morning.
On long trallers wlth soldlers In Jeeps
and many, many trucks.
- And the thlng cllcked.
- Oh, how It cllcked.
Not the mlsslles, but when the trucks
went by covered wlth canvas,
click, click, click!
Look. Just the way you showed me.
The tapes are in
the centre of the spool.
They would have to undo ribbon
to find them.
Good boy. Where is the information
about the Russian troops,
the caves and the installations?
Here, on this key, miniaturised as
a microdot, on the bottom period.
- All right.
- You will give me your own razor?
And extra blades?
Here is your new razor
and the cartridge for the blades.
How do you fit the film in there?
Wejust fold each one.
Very good.
Something for you
to read on the plane.
- Thank you.
- No. Not now.
I will take these down.
- Come.
- No.
No farewells at the front door.
I shall say goodbye to you here.
On our own.
If things get worse for you here,
we'll get you out.
I have ways.
I'll never leave here.
I am Cuban.
I love my country.
No matter what,
I... have to see it through.
I shall worry about you
at the airport.
- I'll get through.
- I don't know.
Will you phone me
before you get on the plane?
Be sure. There is something
I have to tell you.
Tell me now.
No. But before you get on the plane.
All right.
(Whispers) Go.
Go.
- You have found out?
- Yes.
Who were they working for?
- Ask her.
- For who?
You ask her.
Who were you working for?
Who sent you to spy at Viriel?
(Mouths)
Who?
(Inaudible Whispering)
What? Say it.
(Whispers) Juanita...
de... Cordoba.
(Munoz) Get rld of them.
Get down to the alrport.
You'd better get out there.
(Munoz) Search everywhere.
Turn the house Inslde out.
- (Munoz) Look In her bedroom.
- What's all this?
You will not touch my bedroom.
Rico, stop this.
Come down.
(Tomas) No, nol Keep backl
- You cannot go In therel
- (Woman) Tomas, stop theml
- (Screamlng)
- Tomas!
You know some people
named Mendoza?
Yes.
They have been saying
terrible things about you.
I do not believe them.
Munoz believes. I can't.
They were tortured?
Even tortured people lie, you know.
I do not want to believe them.
Eh, Rico, we have found it.
In the pantry.
A darkroom for developlng plctures
and machlnery to make them small.
It Is all true. They have been
operatlng from thls house.
Get me the airport.
You know what this is?
For razor blades.
It is where they hide the film.
Hello, Rivero, do you still have
the Frenchman?
Nothing? All right.
I'll tell you where to flnd lt.
Any small package of razor blades.
The Injector-type blades.
(Shouts) They're small thin ones
that slide out.
Call me back. You know where.
So it is true.
I have to believe now.
The things you have done against us,
against what we are trying to do.
Why?
Because you make
my country oppressed.
No.
You cannotjudge.
You...
You shouldn't have done this.
To fool me.
To work against me.
You are part of it.
Now we will have to do to you
what we did to the Mendozas.
To find out
the names of all the others.
All the things that you have done.
And we will find out.
And the things...
that will be done to your body.
This body.
(Gunshot)
(Phone Rlngs)
Yes, Rlvero?
What?
Nothing?
No film?
What was in the razor-blade case?
Razor blades?
What do you mean
you had to let him go?
All rlght.
All right!
They let him go.
(Phone Rings)
Hello. Who Is thls?
Oh, Senor Devereaux?
Senora de Cordoba?
I'm afrald not.
Somethlng has happened.
She Is dead. Shot.
Senor Parra? He Is gone.
(Engine Starts)
That's quite a pile of mail.
Has Nicole gone away?
Yes, yes...
I... didn't tell you.
She thought she mlght go to Parls
for a whlle,
as long as I was golng to be away.
She... didn't see as much of Michìle
in New York as she'd hoped.
That was my fault.
I am sorry about that.
No, no. She got a bit homesick
for Paris anyway.
And she didn't know how long
I would be in Cuba.
The amount ofjunk mail
that accumulates in just a few days.
Come and have a drink.
Are you sure
you wouldn't like to call Nicole?
No. Besides, you can
phone your office in a few minutes.
They must have the stuff from Cuba
processed.
I won't be a minute.
I'll just get some ice.
(Doorbell Rings)
Ah, René, come In.
- I've come to...
- You know Mike Nordstrom?
René d'Arcy.
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.
We are just about to have a drink.
Will you join us?
I only dropped by to see you.
If I could speak to you alone.
- I'll go.
- No, no, please.
We can go to my study.
Here, make yourself a drink.
Come on, René.
You left quite a few complications
behind.
Yes, I know.
So it is done,
whatever you have done.
The Cuban government has protested
your activities directly to Paris.
I am here to instruct you to be
on the next plane to Paris tonight.
You will report
to the Director General.
Well?
The end of Washington for me.
I have been recalled.
I'm sorry.
You know how grateful we all are
for your contribution.
It confirms our information from other
sources, including the U-2 photos.
What do you think
will happen in Paris?
Oh... A board of inquiry, I suppose.
Why I went to Cuba.
What I did. Who I did it for.
Why I did it for you.
And what I found out.
I want you to take a ride with me
out to the safe house.
While you were away, the Russian came
up with revelations that will shake you.
- What about?
- The leaks in Paris.
He spelled the whole thing out
for us.
I want you to listen to him
before you face those people there.
Ah, thank you, Mrs Fawcett.
I will serve the coffee.
Mrs Fawcett makes
wonderful coffee.
- Will that be all?
- Yes, thank you, Mrs Fawcett.
- Monsieur Devereaux?
- No, thank you.
Mr Nordstrom?
Black with one sugar?
Mr McKittreck, black?
And could I offer you a cigarette?
Ah, no, you are smoking.
And now again... Topaz.
These gentlemen have asked me
to repeat to you about Topaz. Why?
Please. Do us a favour.
Tell him what you told us.
Then you succeeded in getting them
the information from Cuba?
Yes.
Now they are afraid you will be obliged
to pass it on to your government.
And what is Topaz?
Topaz is the codename for a group
of French officials in high circles
who work for the Soviet Union.
I don't believe
there is an organised ring.
The head of the ring
has the codename Columbine.
I do not know him, but I know
he is important and powerful.
The second man in line
is Henri Jarré.
- Jarré?
- Yes.
Henri Jarré.
He was my direct contact.
Any vital documents that passed
across his desk came to me.
Do you know him, André?
Yes. He is an economist at NATO.
Then it is believable?
It's... possible.
It's more than possible. It's true.
So now you will want to talk,
you three.
I will go for a walk in the garden
before the sun goes down.
(Nordstrom) Blake?
Monsieur Devereaux. You are faced
with the same problem I had.
Whether to obey your consclence
or to obey your government.
Let me glve you a plece of advlce.
Don't go home.
These people wlll glve you
a new llfe, a new job. Everythlng.
Think it over.
Well?
Our government is preparing
to take any action against Cuba,
or Russia,
that circumstances demand.
Any leak to the Russians of what
we know at this time could be fatal.
If the Russians learn
we are on the move
because of all the information
we have,
they could make those missiles
operational almost immediately.
Pointed at every big city in America.
(Devereaux) And that means
France wlll be Involved.
We have to inform our allies
of our intentions.
When?
An American mission will arrive
in Paris in three days.
And I am supposed to keep
my mouth shut and uncover Topaz?
At the risk of my own skin?
That's quite a job, my friends.
Let me understand something.
Nobody up high is to know
that we are here with André.
Otherwise, I shall have to leave.
That is understood, Jean.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
I am not afraid.
It is a matter of protocol.
He has not seen
the Director General.
It is true. And for myself,
I don't see how we can help.
- Jacques, when you spoke to Jarré...
- Ah, here he is.
- Good afternoon.
- How are you?
- Sorry I am late. André, how are you?
- I am glad you came, Henri.
Good. We are all here.
Let's sit down.
Now, this is a serious matter
for André. Very grave.
And he has asked us to give him
whatever advice we can
before he faces
the Director General.
(Chabrler) It Is not so much
the Dlrector General.
It is the whole board of inquiry
he has to look out for.
There is nothing I can tell them.
Nonsense. You went to Cuba
on a mission for the Americans.
You obtained certain information
for them. That's true?
Yes.
You refuse to pass it on
to your own government.
I cannot, my friends. Believe me.
Why not?
There are leaks in our government
and I don't know where they are.
- I think I must go.
- No, Jean, stay.
No-one wlll be compromlsed,
I promlse you.
André.
To be a man of principle is one thing
but a man doesn't cut his throat
on principle.
I have no desire to cut my throat.
(Sayover) Then tell us, your frlends.
That's why we are here.
Be reasonable, André.
We are trying to help you.
Yes, my friends.
Slowly. Slowly.
Let André tell us in his own way.
Have any of you
in your official work
had any hint of a spy ring
called Topaz?
- No?
- What kind of a ring?
It's a number of Frenchmen,
compatriots of ours, high in official
circles, working for the Soviet Union.
- I go.
- (Devereaux) Jeanl Slt down. I need you.
I have nothing to do with spies.
I am concerned with exposing them.
This is very dear.
How do you know about this...
ring of spies?
The Americans have
a Russian defector, high in the KGB.
- We know that.
- Yes, that is known.
I saw him.
I was allowed to talk to him.
- He told me.
- A spy ring?
- Called Topaz?
- (Devereaux) Yes.
What is the name of the defector?
Boris Kusenov.
But, André, that is not possible.
Why?
The KGB official
of whom you speak, Boris Kusenov,
has been dead for over a year.
This man planted on the Americans
is obviously a double agent.
And he has taken in the Americans.
And he has taken in you.
How do you know that?
- What makes you think that?
- It's a matter of record.
I have it in my files.
You know you are not
supposed to come here, unless I ask you.
I have been calllng your offlce
all afternoon.
I even called thls number.
I hate to seem impatient,
but I am expecting a visitor.
I apologise for this invasion
of your privacy.
Why did you permit Devereaux
to include me at that lunch?
If I had not,
he would have wondered.
If you had not come,
he would have wondered more.
But he knew. You could see
that he knew about me.
No. He wasn't sure.
He was trying to find out.
And you, who behaved so well
at the beginning,
then did
something extremely foolish.
To say that the Russian defector
was dead...
It shook him. It stopped him.
For the moment. By now,
he is checking with the Americans.
By tomorrow...
he will know that we are lying.
What will we do?
Nothing.
Let me give you something
to settle your nerves.
A cognac?
You don't think Devereaux
should be treated... seriously?
An ominous
and subtle suggestion, eh, Henri?
But these things
are not done in panic.
You will forgive me if I don'tjoin you
but I am expecting a guest.
If I am Devereaux's target now,
how long before he will become
a threat... to others
Jacques...
This is not the first time
you have been faced
with a problem that demanded...
the final solution.
Now, if you will finish that cognac.
They are publishing things
in the newspapers that make me nervous.
What things?
Those little hints of possible leaks
in the government, in NATO?
- Pay no attention. It's nothing.
- Nothing for you.
Nobody would think of you
in your position. But me?
Now some journalist has called
to ask me for an interview.
About what?
NATO.
That's perfectly innocent.
Give it to him. Did you refuse?
No. I said I would.
Very intelligent.
Jacques...
If Devereaux has the information
from the Russian defector that I think
he has, he must be stopped now.
Belleve me.
How bloodthirsty you are.
What, Devereaux dead?
A grieving widow?
An offlclal Investlgatlon?
I hate to seem impatient,
but I am expecting a visitor.
You can flnd your way out.
- Shall I call you after the interview?
- What time will it be?
- Nine o'clock.
- Call me afterwards.
Thank you for coming.
Why shouldn't I come?
I am a free woman.
- Good evening. François Picard.
- You are early.
- We said 8:30.
- We said nine o'clock.
I am sorry. If it inconveniences you...
- No, come in, as long you are here.
- Thank you.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- Could I give you something?
- No, thanks.
First, I want to thank you
for permitting me to come.
Don't mention it.
Yours is a very good newspaper.
Not like some of these...
But I don't know exactly
what you want of me.
Nothing extraordinary. I am just
enquiring into the workings of NATO.
Since you are one of its officials...
Do you mind if I sketch you
while we talk?
It's my speciality.
Sketching people I am interviewing.
- The newspaper likes it.
- Go ahead.
Just relax, Monsieur Jarré.
I am relaxed.
Good.
I only wonder what questions
you want to ask.
They are very simple. For example:
You are a civilian official of NATO.
How does your authority
compare with the military?
The importance of people in NATO
has nothing to do with whether
they wear a uniform or not.
Very good.
Then you are among those
who make the decisions?
- Yes, of course.
- Even if they are military?
Military considerations
are always subject to politics
and the relations between countries.
I see.
So you have access
to all the decisions that are made,
military as well as political?
I did not say that.
I am afraid you assumed too much.
I am very sorry. But we can assume,
can't we, that in your position
you have access to confidential files?
I beg your pardon. I don't see how
that can be of interest to you.
Oh, Monsieur Jarré.
The readers of our newspaper
find such things fascinating.
For them, to know a civilian
can have access to military secrets...
You cannot print that I have access
to military secrets.
Even if it were true,
it would be classified information.
What a shame.
But you said before...
I said that I help make decisions.
That is different.
OK. That's too bad.
But you see, sir, it is a rule
for a newspaperman not to be dull.
Surely I can print that files marked
"top secret" cross your desk every day?
Why do you stay on this subject?
What are you trying to find out?
Well, everyone knows
that there are leaks in NATO.
What has that to do with me?
I am just trying to clear up
a discrepancy for my article.
What discrepancy?
You see, sir, it is our information
that the head of the Russian NATO,
Boris Kusenov,
has defected and is in Washington.
But we are also Informed that
you clalmed Borls Kusenov Is dead.
Could you clear up this discrepancy?
(Drawer Opens)
This is not a newspaper interview?
No.
But I wouldn't mind publishing it.
- Who sent you?
- My father-in-law.
- Who is he?
- André Devereaux.
He sent you
because I don't know you.
And because I am a journalist.
I can probe.
There is nothing to probe for.
Your mission has failed.
Oh, no, sir. This cannot be escaped.
Boris Kusenov is alive and has stated
you are his direct contact.
The Amerlcans have
NATO documents that you gave to hlm.
Wlth your name on them,
your Inltlals on them,
even notatlons slgned by you.
Those documents can be on the desk
of the head of our government
In elght hours.
I do not think I have failed.
- What do you want of me?
- Information.
- And in return?
- You'll be given time to disappear.
We know you wlll be welcome
elsewhere.
I am not going to talk to you.
Wlll you talk to Devereaux?
May I call Devereaux?
Yes.
Call him.
He must come here.
I'll talk to him here.
Alone.
Understood.
(Doorbell Rings)
(Jarré) Yes?
Hello, Michìle.
Let me talk to André, quick.
André. Listen. It's done. Yes.
Alone?
Well, stay until I get there.
Then you can wait for me outside.
(Line Goes Dead)
François.
- François!
- What is it?
I think we have been cut off.
Jarré, Jarré...
There it is.
There is no answer.
Something has happened.
- I am going over there.
- I am coming.
- You stay.
- I am coming with you!
Here you are.
Good, his car is here.
He must still be upstairs.
(Mlchele) Ohl
- What's the matter?
- Look... Look...
(Mlchele gasps)
(Devereaux) Jarré...
(Doorbell Rings)
(Urgent Ringing)
Michìle, is that you?
- François?
- (Sobbing)
Sit down. I'll get you something.
- What's the matter?
- François.
What's happened to him?
What's happened to him?
He disappeared.
He went to do a job for me.
What kind ofjob?
To interview a man
in our government named Jarré.
He was working for the Russians.
- Oh, André!
- François!
- Be careful.
- What is it?
To be honest, I have been shot.
Just a little.
Come on, sit down.
- Maman.
- No, wait, Michìle.
It's nothing, I promise you.
It hurts a bit.
I don't even think it's bleeding.
- What do you mean, not bleeding?
- Get some alcohol.
- We haven't got any.
- Then eau de cologne. And a bandage.
Is the bullet in?
Let me have a look.
No, itjust grazed you.
- I told you. Nothing.
- Nothing? You disappear, it's nothing?
- Could I have some whisky?
- Here, cognac.
Thank you.
What happened?
I don't know. I was talking to you
on the phone, remember?
Then I heard Jarré let some men
into the apartment.
And then someone must have
hit me on the head. Feel that.
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.
Next, I was sitting in a car
between two men.
They stopped to make a phone call
because they didn't know
what to do with me.
They thought I was still unconscious.
When the car door opened, I jumped out
and ran. There were two shots.
- You might have been killed.
- Did you go to Jarré's apartment?
- Yes, he is dead.
- Dead? Shot by those men?
They made it look like suicide.
A window was open and his body
was lying in a courtyard.
Who were they?
Messengers from Columbine,
the head of Topaz.
Why?
I must have shaken Jarré
at that lunch. He became a risk.
Then Columbine
must have been there, too.
Yes.
But... who?
- It hurts.
- Shouldn't we get a doctor?
No. Not yet.
It may involve us with the police.
I just remembered.
I might get involved.
- How?
- My sketchbook. I left it there.
No, I brought it away with us.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Look, Michìle.
A portrait of a dead traitor.
And If you had arrlved later,
you would never have seen hlm.
(Nlcole) Lle down.
I'll get you a blanket.
(Françols) Oh, André.
There is one thing I didn't tell you
that is important.
When the men stopped to phone,
just before I got away,
I heard one ask the other
for a phone number.
It was Babylon 8583.
- You are sure?
- I am positive. Babylon 8583.
I can have it tracked down
in no time.
You don't have to trace that number.
It's a small house,
hidden away on the Left Bank.
Jacques Granville.
Horrible...
Horrible!
- Mr Ambassador, how are you?
- How do you do?
Good to see you again.
Anything on Topaz?
Who's running it?
Jacques Granville. A friend of mine.
- A friend?
- Yeah.
Up till ten o'clock last night.
But I can't nail him down.
No proof.
I brought this old picture along.
It will help you recognise him.
He'll be at your meeting
with our people this afternoon.
That poses a problem for us,
doesn't it?
- How can we tell the French about...
- Mlkel
Thank you. Take care.
(Chatter)
(Inaudible)
Gentlemen, would you be kind enough
to take your seats at the end?
What do you suggest we do?
It would be best to tell them
right away.
Gentlemen, one moment, please.
(Inaudible)
Just a minute.
Look, Jacques, I am sorry. The Americans
would rather that you are not present.
There isn't time to explain now.
I will explain later.
(Gunshot)
(Patriotic Music)
