When did you went to Punjab,
Shut up!
This is the new way to cheat people.
They cheated me,

from my own hands.
I am telling you that I am his brother
and his son,

We will rob the world.
But one day he will rob us.

Dharam's mood is off.
But tomorrow he will be fine,
Keep in touch,
I met them both,
How are you?

But what?
They are very bad,
In fact he refused to recognize me,
and,
He didn't tell Gajodhar about us,
How is your brother?
He is good.
But...
He is like papa.
Don't go bad with him,
How would I?
I am your son,
Lawyer tell him that I have 10 more
banglows in this city.
Take anyone what he like.

Nowadays you are not paying
attention in business.
What about that mistake what you

Nobody said thanks,

I think you Dharam don't like
my timing,
It's not like that,
you owe us.
Ask what do you want?
Partnership!
Accepted!
Partnership for what?
Our business is good going and he
wants partnership for jeep.
Who saved you life in bar?
And again today.
I think it's my job to save your lives,
He is right,
Ask you Dharam, why he is not
agreed with partnership.
Give me your hand,
From today you will work with us,
I can do anything to achieve you,
Our pair will rock,
What happen?
I am in love.
I love you since your childhood.

What she is doing here?
Can't you see?
She is taking photos,
She is writing a book on banaras.
Did she got my Gajodhar's photo,
Don't embarass me,
Go away from here,
What else you know about her?
She is Sardarni,
How do you know?
I can recognize Sardarnis from miles.
I mean she is a nice girl.
What's the problem?
If you like her then what's
the problem?
I can't tell her my feelings,
I can't see your condition,
I know how to talk with girls.
I will talk to her and fix your matter.
I want to talk to you,
yes!
What he is telling her?
That guy is showing style in goggles.
He is saying that he loves you alot.
I tried to explain him,
This is not a girl like others,
I want to tell you something,
He is a thief, thug...
and he speaks water like lie.
I mean he speaks lie like water,
But he loves you alot.
Now I have expressed his feelings
to you,
Now what's in your heart?
you tell him from your self.
It will be better for me to leave
this situation,
Dharam must have told you about
my feelings,
I am a thief....
What else I do?
you are drunk,
By chance if you will miss your aim,
then my head will blow up.
And you didn't feel anything while
you were blowing my heart.
you are talking about your head.
Don't move otherwise I will
blow your face.
I think you have forgotten my
golden principles.
I told you have fun but don't
fall in love.
Did you ever seen any married
man happy?
I am happy,
you always interfere.
you want to win girl's heart?
What's the problem?
It will be done,
He finished my love story
before it begins,
I will jump down and die,
Those days are gone,
When matter were get solved to
climb up on tanks.
I can help you out,
your all mistakes get forgiven when
you talk from the bottom of your heart,
you need courage to talk,
Am I right?
As much you will make relations,
you will get sorrow when they
will break up as well.
you didn't broke any relation,
Then how could you realize that pain,
For the beginning of new relation,
you just said come in,
Why are you getting angry?
This is for you,
What's this?
Friendship cards.
Keep anyone whatever you like,
you keep all of them,
Dharam gave wrong impression
of mine,
I also got you a gift.
Brinjels?
Total 2 kg.

Mostly I saw you buying them,
I am giving present to some girl.
I am little bit nervous,
I like Punjab,
Sometimes I feel....
that I was also Punjabi in last birth,
Nice place!
I went there few times,
you are not from Punjab,
No!
I am from Calcutta.
I have seen his all movies.
I was joking,
I am from Gujrat.
Why don't you decide that
what do you like?
Why don't you decide that
where you from?
He brought brinjles for girl.
Somebody bring brinjels to
impress a girl.
I don't have diploma that what you
should give present a girl.
And you were gone like this?
Why?
What's wrong with me?
you will have to change your style.
He won't get a rentle girlfriend.
What you couldn't do

He also have something missing,
He don't drink.
Beer doesn't suit my system,
I drunk once,
One day I got drunk and,
hijack the elevator.
you are an amazing guy,
you drink milk,
you are also amazing,
I wish we both would have grown
up together.
you are talking about grown up,
My childhood didn't over yet,
Forget about me but my Dharam....
his childhood didn't over yet,
He still behave like youngsters.
you are my everything,
My mom and my father.
Where is your mom?
He is my mom,
your real mom,
Don't know,
She left us,
He spoiled my mood,
you didn't tell him anything,
Don't worry,
I won't tell him either,
But I will must take you and
Gajodhar to mom,
Take our photo too,
I have got photo on your neck,
you also want one,
I don't like violence,
But I can't tolerate nonsense,
If somebody will mis-behave then
violence is necessary,
Am I looks smart?
Actually somebody said your heart
is good or not,
but your face and clothes should
be good.
What's this?
Read it.
I am graduate,
What's this?
My character certificate,
I have got in college.
Now college teacher won't
write lie.
My heart is very good,
Lever, Kidney would have problems,
What's the matter?
I was thinking about us,
This is good,
But think with love why
with sadness,
you don't know my brothers,
I don't then I will.
They will never agree.
Why these brothers....
always interfere in every
love story,
From centuries Sahiba's brothers
were against her love.
And may be this time too.
you don't looks older.
It's an old love story of Punjab,
Mirza Sahiba!
I heard first time some guy name
before a girl name,
Otherwise Laila Majnu, Heer Ranjha,
Mirza was some kind of guy,
Mirza and Sahiba were
childhood friends,
And when they grown up their
friendship becomes loves,
But Sahiba's brothers didn't like
this relation,
It means Mirza sung a song and died
front of Sahiba's house.
Mirza wasn't like other lovers.
Sahiba wrote a letter to Mirza.
and told him if you are a real man,
then elope me,
And Mirza eloped Sahiba on her
marriage day,
This Mirza is an amazing guy,
Otherwise who got a girl
after death,
you must have to elope her,
Sahiba's brother were follwing them,
When Mirza was taking rest
under the tree.
Then Sahiba saw her brothers
are coming,
Now on one side it was her love and
another side her brothers.
Sahiba knew one thing,
If Mirza will woke up,
then he will kill all his brothers.
Sahiba thought she will appease
her brothers.
And she broke all his arrows.
But her brothers didn't listen to her,
And they attacked on Mirza.
And When Mirza woke up
and picked up his bow to fight
with them,
then he found out Sahiba's act,
And Mirza lost his life.
Amazing lover!
But one thing is confirm,
These girls always take their
lover's life.
Girls have to take all
difficult decisions.
If Sahiba's brother would die,
then world would curse Sahiba,
Sahiba got killed her brothers.
So today's Sahiba
have to choose Mirza or his brothers
then who she will choose?
Wait!
Let me see the guy.
Why you are so upset?
Let's go home,
We will drink beer,
And our mood will be fine,
Everything is finished Dharam,
I have to go to Sahiba,
nothing is over,
I will bring you another girl.
Gajodhar is broken,
I can't see him cry,
I always made mock of his love.
you can help him,
What can I do for him?
He have faith in you,
If you want you can do everything,
Why should I help him?
Because you are his brother,
you are my son,
I want to hear it from you,
If you wouldn't ask me,
I would still help him,
I trust you,
Promise me,
you won't tell this truth to Gajodhar,
He was 2 months old,
When I took him away,
I committed a big sin to take
him away from his mother,
If Gajodhar will know this thing,
he will start hating me,
He will leave me,
I couldn't tolerate this shock.
Don't tell him,
I won't tell him,
you will come once to
meet mom,
To your mom,
How would I face her?
your mom is very great,
Let's go,
Where?
To bring your Sahiba,
How would be bring her
from Punjab,
This guy is not good!
