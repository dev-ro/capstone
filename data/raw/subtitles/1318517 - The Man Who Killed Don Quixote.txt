I
was born by the special will
of heaven in this Age
of Iron to restore
the lost age of chivalry.
I am the man for whom all
dangers are expressly reserved
and grand adventures
and brave deeds also.
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha.
This will be a marvelous
day for adventure, Sancho.
I feel it in my bones.
Good god, Sancho!
A giant!
Where?
There!
With arms six miles long...
just facing his
terrible, grinding teeth.
I am sworn to rid the earth of
this foul and fearsome giant,
Sancho!
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha.
It's just a windmill.
Prepare to die!
And cut right there.
Good work.
Speak in
English for Christ's sake!
No, no, it's not we
can muck up the world.
It's we can fuck up the world.
That's what I wrote.
That's what we're
going to shoot.
Me organ grinder.
You monkey.
No agua, thank you.
That was a good one.
Did you buy that?
We could cut that
together, couldn't we?
That's someone
else's job, isn't it.
I said I want
laughing, smiling, happy,
clappy people... white, black,
yellow, green, LGBT, GLBT, GNT,
fucking T&A. I
don't give a fuck,
so long as the ratio is right.
OK?
Got to go.
Hands to hold.
Oh, Toby.
What is this?
What is this I feel?
I don't know, Rupert.
What is it?
Your 15%?
A little hard grain
needing to be worn down, hmm?
Turned to dust, blown
away on the wind.
We should move
along, shouldn't we?
Good idea.
Toby, I am so sorry.
Toby, it's these bloody Spanish.
They can't seem to handle
anything too complicated.
Could you get me down, Fritzi?
It's a reset...
everybody back to first!
The crank! The
crank is wrong.
We're not going to make it.
No, I want to drop
some of the shots.
Yes!
Are you sure?
Why?
Because it isn't working.
Because my client isn't happy.
Because the whole
concept is ridiculous.
Because we become
what we hold on to.
That's true.
It's your concept,
your vision,
your idea to come to
Spain in the first place.
I know... the smell, the
sweat, the real España.
Well then?
Well, I was wrong.
Oh, Sarah!
How's it going, Sarah?
Melissa.
How's it going, Melissa?
Toby, I can't.
You can.
You must.
You shall.
I'm sorry.
Can you please?
Look, can we please come up
with some other ideas here?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Just a thought...
how about we just
CGI the giant back in London?
Great idea,.
Is that your best,
when we have paid
- for everybody to come out here?
- Yeah.
And Toby hates CGI.
He wants it all handcrafted.
I am a
little bit worried
about the negative
connotations here.
I mean, Power Grid...
It's the world
through Quixote's eyes.
...is a
multinational giant.
Just like the book.
There's a book?
Do we have the rights?
Hey, you fucking tampered with
this, haven't you, you bastard?
You should get me a fresh one.
If anything happens
to me, I will come here,
and I will personally
shit down your throat.
Well done.
Well, now that our producer
here has so bravely thwarted
the terrorist threat to our
water supply, I'd like to say,
buenos noches.
We need you, Toby.
Don't we, everyone?
Everybody needs you, Toby.
You don't.
You are not going anywhere.
You're the epic fucking genius.
Well, fuck you too.
Well, will you
noli me tangere?
Mmm.
Genuflect, everyone.
She's adorable, so transparent
you can read her like a book.
Yeah, and slightly worn,
spine-rubbed, some foxing.
Hombre, que tal?
That's what they say
over here, isn't it?
I wouldn't know.
I don't talk to them.
Jacqui.
Hey, I hope you're
not giving our Man of La
Mancha too much of a hard time.
Not at all.
You can trust our Toby.
Just as I was saying.
My family, to a great
campaign, to Power Grid...
here's to us and
bugger the rest.
Bugger the rest.
Yes, bugger them
all with impunity.
Yeah.
I got to go.
I got a meeting in Nice.
Potential client, Russian vodka.
They got me on
their private jet.
Well, it's good to know
people are still showing
off the size of their dicks.
I wanted you to keep an
eye on her when I'm gone.
Do that for me?
- Of course he will.
- Yeah.
Sure I will.
What's the problem, son?
Got it wrong.
We should scrap
the whole campaign.
Aw.
Hold your nerve.
You're a great talent.
He's a genius.
He's a visionary.
Really doesn't help.
Maybe you need
some inspiration.
Hey, you!
Come here.
Yeah.
There are some ideas
in here you might...
What?
Steal?
Or use.
Se or, maybe this one?
Wow.
That's strange.
Look, this is perfect.
Isn't that our Man from
La Mancha for real?
That's the way, my family.
He's going to be great.
My money?
Hey.
Stay.
I don't like to
leave you here.
- You're in a strange mood.
- Sit.
Where'd you get this?
Uh, that's a good question.
I found it.
Toby?
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, hey, hey,
aren't you supposed
to be looking after me tonight?
God knows someone should.
Do you have a DVD player?
You're bad.
You bad boy.
Bad and wicked.
Will you hold that pose?
I am
Don Quixote de la Mancha.
I was born by a
special will of heaven
to restore the lost
age of chivalry
for the protection of the
weak and for grand adventures.
What is it?
"The Man Who
Killed Don Quixote."
I made it a long time ago.
My graduation film.
It won me awards.
Oh.
Oh, the old man is wonderful.
Yeah, you know, I'm
trying to break the cliche,
you know, not using actors,
real people, use villagers.
Yeah.
He was a shoemaker, I think.
Yeah, yeah.
And I can see why they
grabbed you from commercials.
Yeah, this must be my
passport to Hollywood.
Yeah.
Toby, I'm The Boss's wife.
Yeah.
You are The Boss's wife.
Yeah I'm The Boss's wife.
You're The Boss's wife.
You're The Boss's wife.
I'm The Boss's wife.
You're The Boss's wife.
Oh no, Sancho, he's crazy...
crazy with love.
I am The Boss's wife.
You're The Boss's wife.
Yeah.
I'm The Boss's wife.
You're The Boss's wife.
Yeah, baby.
Oh, mm.
Jacqui!
But he's in Nice.
He'll kill me.
What about me?
Jacqui!
Shit!
Jacqui!
Shit.
Oh god.
I'm back!
Every man for himself.
What?
- Jacqui!
- Come on.
Come on.
I don't have time.
Hurry up!
Gotcha!
Oh, Toby, your beads.
Oh, shit!
Fuck.
Go.
Jacqui!
Vamos!
I'm going to kill you,
you greasy gyppo!!
Hey, baby.
That was the only cut.
I don't even know
what that's for.
Toby.
Toby.
- Check this.
- Hold on.
Hey, pal.
Toby.
Come here.
Check this out.
Holy shit.
- Right?
- He's perfect.
Hola.
Hola, se or.
Hmm?
Un momento, por favor?
Que?
Well.
Hi, hola.
Hola, we're American.
Or I'm American.
- This is Jimmy and Joe.
- Hi.
We're making
What are you doing for
the next two months?
Javier, you're making shoes now.
My shoes...
No, no, no.
Forget the shoes, man!
- These are bandidos.
- Bandidos.
You're angry.
Yeah, yeah.
The girl is in danger.
OK?
No.
Fuck that.
Ah!
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha!
Ahh!
And he goes down.
Then you hit this one,
and then that goes down.
Si, Javier?
Si?
And gone.
Si?
Aye, si, si.
Comprende?
Forget the shoes.
You are Don Quixote.
Si, comprendo.
No, Javier, you
are Don Quixote.
OK.
Don Quixote.
- And?
- Ouch.
Huh?
If there's something
that doesn't translate
through a Polaroid,
then it's not going
- to translate through a camera.
- How about that one?
No, absolutely not.
What about this one?
That's my favorite.
No, none of these.
She's his dulcinea...
you know, his ideal.
She has to be
beautiful and pure.
Just like in the book, the Lady
Dulcinea looked up but once,
and their eyes met, and
from that brief moment
on Don Quixote de la Mancha
became free from all fear.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Careful, Toby.
She's Raul's little girl.
Toby, Toby, Toby, Toby!
You could be though...
you could be in movies.
I'm serious.
Really?
- Yes.
- To die?
Sure.
Why not?
I'm serious.
- A little village girl like me?
- Yeah.
Don't break it.
Oh, please god.
What if like...
- if I let it...
- No!
Oh, please.
Why?
I'm serious.
You could be someone.
Either you are very naive,
or you are very crazy.
Well, you know,
an artist has to be.
OK.
Now you're... now
you're an artist.
Yeah.
An artist must be cruel.
Are you cruel?
Wait, wait... wait there.
What do you see?
A star.
Angelica, where are you?
It's late.
I'm hungry!
I love you.
It's like I was
really back there again.
I could smell it.
And then I wake up.
A sue o, a beautiful dream.
Yeah, but I don't dream.
No, of course not.
You don't have to.
You have everything.
I had no idea the
village was this close.
Los Sue os is just
over the hill there.
He's fucking mental.
It still isn't working.
We've got to shoot something.
We cannot just sit here.
Set up a crane shot
of the wind turbines.
Put it on a long track.
The crane's on the other side.
Yeah.
It's going to take hours.
Perfect.
You're back.
Surprise.
I didn't need to go after all.
Turns out they got
a castle out here.
The Russkies are buying up
everything, aren't they?
But it's looking good
for our Vodka gig.
We'll know in a couple of days.
I asked you to look
after my wife, Toby.
I did.
No, not very well.
There was a thief in
our fucking hotel suite.
What?
A thief?
Are you sure?
That'd what she says.
You know what I think?
I think it was that greasy
gypsy from last night.
I found his hat.
Right.
Yeah.
He seemed dodgy.
Yeah.
Well, they all are, aren't they?
You look tired, son.
Oh, you know, it's just
watching that old DVD.
Yeah.
Jacqui told me.
She told you?
Yeah.
A work of yours, she said.
That's a coincidence.
Yeah.
Yeah, such a long time ago.
It looks like it was
made by somebody else.
Yeah, why don't you polish
up some of those old ideas,
make them nice and shiny for us?
Yeah, I could.
I don't know.
You know what?
While they're
setting up, I think
I'm going to go for a spin.
Clear your head?
Right.
I'll drive you.
No, that's OK.
Dan the man.
Yo, Toby.
Lend me your bike.
OK.
Gracias.
Are you coming, my love?
No.
Oh but, um.
I don't have a helmet.
- You don't need one.
- Take care.
All right.
Great, great, great.
Thank you.
Cut, cut, cut, cut.
Thank you.
Cut.
Gracias a todos.
Thank you very much.
Hasta manana.
Hasta manana!
Do
you want something more?
I do, yeah, so many things...
better writing ability mostly.
Jesus.
No, no, no, no.
No.
Shh.
You will be sent with my squire-
Javier, Javier, this is great.
This is great.
This time take two.
Todo in Inglés, please?
Inglés.
- Yeah, in Inglés.
- Inglés.
Action.
Si, si.
Unhand her, foul bandido!
Stand and face justice!
OK.
OK.
Cut, cut, cut, cut.
Perfecto.
Wow.
I am Don Quixote.
You
are Don Quixote.
I am Don Quixote.
Por favor.
Raul?
How's it going?
Long time no see.
We don't need these.
We understand one
another perfectly.
Hey, shiny boy, Little Pedro
was in this film of yours,
yeah?
Yes, he was, Little
Pedro, right, Sancho Panza,
all 250 pounds of him.
How is he?
Little Pedro?
He's dead.
Shit.
He liked to drink.
- The drink didn't like him.
- OK.
I'm sorry.
To Little Pedro.
Many things have changed
since your film, Toby.
What about Javier?
The old man who played Quixote?
Is he...
is he still alive?
Alive?
Oh yeah.
Don Quixote Vive, if that's
what you like to call him.
Oh good.
How about Angelica?
Angelica?
Angelica, your daughter.
Come.
I will take you.
I will show you.
Oh, she's here?
Yeah.
Oh, fantastic.
She was so great in the movie.
Ooh.
She was a flower.
And they grow up, Raul.
For Christ's sake, it's
what they're meant to do.
My daughter?
The whore?
No.
What are you talking about?
She was such a sweet girl.
No more.
She chase your dream,
Toby, to Madrid.
She break.
What the fuck!
Give me that.
- You...
- Papa!
- Papa!
- Fuck!
You little fucking prick.
Hey!
What the hell did
you call my boy?
Jesus!
Come back here, you creep!
Quixote Vive?
Hello?
Hola!
Hi.
There's a sign, Quixote Vive?
You want to see him?
Would you like to
see the Don Quixote
de la Mancha, the
real Don Quixote?
I do.
Come on.
OK.
No, no, no.
I am Don
Quixote de la Mancha.
I was born in the year
of our Savior, 1605,
by special will of
heaven to restore
the lost age of chivalry.
I am the man for
whom all dangers
are expressly resulting.
And grand adventures
and brave deeds also.
I am 400 years old.
It's not easy living so long.
But I cannot die
unless perhaps I
could rid myself of my dreams.
Holy shit.
Javier?
Sancho?
Is that you?
Sancho!
No.
Sancho,
you've come back!
You've come back to save me.
Oh, oh, oh, you tricky peasant!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh!
OK.
OK.
I'm not Sancho.
And you're not Don Quixote.
Mmm.
You, Sancho.
Oh.
Sancho, Sancho, isn't it you?
You must rescue me
from these enchanters, huh?
Please, Sancho, take me...
take me away, Sancho.
OK.
Yeah.
I'm a little late
for something now.
- But maybe...
- No, Sancho!
- Please, Sancho!
- All right.
Ease up, Javier.
All right.
Let go.
All right.
Let me out of here!
Let me out, please.
Javier, I've got to go.
Oh, what are you going?
Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Just look at the
fucking facts, Rupert.
We bring a whole
crew over to Spain.
He vanishes into thin air
on a fucking motorbike.
You're talking.
There's only one
genius on this set,
and it's certainly
not you, is it?
He's not a genius.
He's like a fucking child.
Ah, Toby!
Where the hell have you been?
We've been stalling here.
We've been dicking
around here for hours.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Calm, dearheart.
Looks like Toby needs a moment.
The agency is
begging for blood.
Bill needs a shot list.
I need... thanks to
you, I need a doctor.
I literally do.
Now, now, Toby.
What's happened to you?
I mean, look at
the state of you.
Oh, and the police are here.
Do you know what, Bill?
It's all yours... the
whole fucking nightmare.
You're promoted.
I quit.
Toby!
They found the thief.
They want that fucking
gypsy, of course.
Do me a favor.
Come identify him for me.
Yeah.
It's looking great.
Hola.
Bien.
Yeah?
He was the creep bothering
my wife in the restaurant
the other night, wasn't he?
Yeah, that's him.
Typical.
Se or,.
This is your motorcycle, Se or?
Uh, mine how?
There has been a fire
in a local village.
That registration number
matches one we were given.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But that's not mine.
I... it's, um...
who's the little... that guy!
Toby, Toby,
don't you remember?
You borrowed it.
He borrowed it for inspiration.
Perhaps you will
come to assist us.
But I don't know
anything about any fire.
I mean, I know what fire is.
But I don't know what
you're talking about.
Better go along
with them, Toby.
We don't want to
antagonize the locals.
Don't worry about
the delay here.
Put it down to act
of God or something.
Oh, wait.
I found these outside
my hotel suite.
Yours, aren't they?
Oh fuck.
Thanks.
Any problems, text me.
I think you got me into a
big trouble, Se or Toby, hmm?
Maybe you should be a man.
Maybe you should tell them, eh?
Fuck this!
God, what I wouldn't
give to get my hands
on one of these bastards
for a few minutes.
Animals!
Still living in the
fucking Middle Ages.
Oh shit.
Fucking...
Holy Week.
Holy Week.
- I know a way around this.
- Are you sure?
We'll be back
on the main road in a moment.
A moment?
How long exactly is a
moment in your life?
I didn't know.
Just shut the fuck up.
What is this?
What the fuck is he doing?
Hey, get out!
Your carnival
is over, old man.
Oh no.
Why are those men in chains?
Sancho.
Shit.
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha.
And I command you to release
my squire, Sancho Panza.
Don Quixote?
Si.
Wow.
Looks like one of you is saved.
This has nothing
to do with me.
I am dedicated to chivalry
and protection of the weak.
Huh?
Your hellish wailing does not
frighten me!
Release those innocent men.
Hey, carnival is...
oh!
What the fuck?
- Get off that horse, you...
- Go!
Get away from Rocinante!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Help!
No, no, no, no, help!
Shit!
What the fuck are
you doing, man?
I think you've killed him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no!
No!
No, please.
- Freeze!
- No!
God no!
Sancho, the forces of
darkness are defeated!
It wasn't me.
I didn't do it.
Fuck.
Shit.
I'm bleeding.
Oh.
Oh.
Thank God it's not mine.
No, no, no.
Fuck.
No!
Please don't let this be real!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Oh shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Fucking batteries!
I'm a dead man.
OK.
OK.
Take control.
Take control, Toby.
Take control and the
world soon follows.
Take control and the
world soon follows.
Take control.
Sancho!
There you are.
You crazy peasant,
always playing games.
Do you think you
can hide from me?
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay away from me.
Sancho, you're free.
Those cops are
dead, aren't they?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
The forces of darkness
can never die.
You killed them, didn't you?
You were so brave, huh?
The way you attacked
that coachman
and frightened away
his wailing beast.
I didn't do anything.
Oh, humility is a blessing.
Tonight, we will sing
songs to your bravery.
I brought you your
clothes, Sancho.
You can get out of
that disguise, eh?
You are free.
Oh, Sancho.
We shall have such great
adventures together.
A knight-errant and
his loyal squire, huh?
Mwah.
Mwah.
Sancho.
This will be a marvelous
day for adventure, Sancho.
I feel it in my bones.
I need to call my office.
Where are we going?
Who knows?
Her destiny guides
our fortune, Sancho.
I'm getting eaten alive.
Look, maybe we
should just go back
and face a few ugly realities.
You can explain everything
to the authorities.
Explain?
Do you think explaining
explains anything?
Well, yes.
You have a simple view of
life, Sancho, very touching.
Yeah.
And you're really Don Quixote.
You doubt it?
Look, do you remember years
ago, about 10 years ago,
I was making a film?
You were just an
old man I found.
- I was lost, forgotten.
- Yeah, right.
But then I found you.
And I thought, this guy
has an interesting face.
It's the kind of face I'd
use now to sell insurance.
I owe you a
great debt, Sancho.
You restored me.
You really don't remember?
Don Quixote
de la Mancha, the knight
of the mournful countenance...
Come to restore the
lost age of chivalry
by a special will of heaven!
Yes.
Well, I wrote that.
Que?
I adapted it, since
a screenplay is a very
different language to a novel.
But it's...
Blasphemer!
The hand of our God
in heaven wrote me,
- not the filthy whore of some...
- OK.
OK.
I apologize.
I'm sorry.
You may beg forgiveness at
the feet of my Lady Dulcinea.
Lady Dulcinea, right?
Of course.
OK.
Once, as if in a
dream, Don Quixote
dreams this Lady Dulcinea.
She was sitting...
Beside a stream before
her crystal mansion.
I know, of course.
Writing again, Sancho?
No.
No.
Because those are the words
of the great Arab historian,
Cide Hamete Benengeli.
Right, right, I forgot.
I have here this rare
volume of my exploits, hmm?
A trifle florid perhaps,
but the spirit is true.
Can I read?
That a peasant like
you should feign interest
in a book he cannot read.
Can I see?
Oh.
But I can read.
This is English, Sancho.
"Eeeen-gleesh."
It's a very difficult language,
a Protestant language.
But come.
Come.
Come.
Sit with me, huh?
We will read it together.
Now, I will sound the words.
And you can look
at the pictures.
Now, here.
Here, this is me on my
war horse, Rocinante.
That's you Sancho.
And here... here...
here is a
beautiful princess, hmm,
resplendent on her charger.
A giant!
What giant?
A giant with arms
six miles long.
She is in terrible danger.
It's a windmill.
Oh!
Rocinante!
Oh!
Rocinante!
I will save you, fair maiden!
Come back here!
Don!
This is a mistake!
Prepare to die, foul
and fearsome beast!
This isn't a giant!
Oh, god no!
Don!
Don!
Take this!
And cut right there.
Oh.
Giant, where are you?
Where are you, huh?
There you are, you thief!
Take that!
Hey!
- Ow.
- Don't move.
Just lay still.
You have saved, dear lady.
I am at your command.
Oh.
I see the love
light in your eyes.
It's understandable.
My hand on it.
But alas, I am
betrothed to another.
Oh.
Oh.
Does he have the
squirrels in the attic?
Squirrels are the least of it.
Do you have a phone I could use?
My father will help you.
Is he a builder?
Or?
It's all very, uh, rustic.
No, se or.
This is oil.
Oil is working,
just squeaky clean.
What?
Not rustic.
Not rustic.
Oh, the bike?
Yeah.
No, it's all very oiled.
Everything's very oily.
Yes.
You can't have too much oil.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wha... you live here?
- Live?
- Yeah.
This is... this is
where you live?
I live here.
I die here.
Right, it's good.
That's good.
I live.
I die.
I live.
I die.
I live.
- Live and die.
- I live.
I die.
Some of us...
some of us sooner than others.
What do you think
you are doing, huh?
Get them out of here!
What is this splendid
castle that defies gravity?
Hello.
Can I use your telephone?
And this angelic messenger
who welcomes us as she...
We don't want any trouble.
Divine lady, I shall
forever preserve your kindness
in the treasury of my memory.
Oh.
Get him out of here.
Come on.
Please, please, my
dear, this is not showing
what good Christians we are.
Remember, this is the Holy Week.
Oh, oh, oh, this old
man must be playing
the part of a martyred saint.
Look, his halo.
So devout.
Is there a telephone?
Elephant?
What elephant?
OK.
I'm going to go.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
You must stay.
You must stay.
Out there is very
dangerous, bad men.
But here, everything is A-OK.
Here, we are all
the good Samaritans.
We will turn the other cheek
to hear your brave martyr.
We must charm these
needy pilgrims.
A good host looks
after his hostages.
Is that the right word?
No, that's not the right word.
Rest here, brave holy martyr.
We'll be back soon.
Why must I be such
an unfortunate knight?
What have you got me into?
Young ladies just
have to look at me once
to be swept away with love.
I abhor you.
Why must my matchless
devotion to my Lady Dulcinea
always be tested?
Why should she be threatened
from being the only one...
Shit!
...to relish my
perfect fidelity.
I knew it.
Well, these people
aren't Spanish.
Que?
We're going to die.
Criminals of the world,
what do you want from her?
Why do you have us?
- Leave her alone!
- Shh!
Would you shut the fuck up?
You do know what
terrorists are, don't you?
They'll probably start mailing
bits of us back to Los Angeles!
I have no family, Sancho.
Not without a fight.
Open the gates!
Open the gates in
the name of the law!
Just cleaning this oil work.
Oh, there is another dirty spot.
See?
OK.
All right.
OK, stop.
Let me go, please.
We'll pretend none
of this has happened.
Listen, I respect all religions.
My maternal
grandmother was Jewish.
- Open the gate!
- Help!
I'm in here!
Help me!
No, no, no.
Please, please,
please, please, please.
If the inquisition
discover we are Muslims,
we will be whipped or
castrated or worse.
No, please!
What are you talking about?
This is the 21st century.
You're in the European Union.
It's not.
In the name of the Holy
Brotherhood, open the gate!
Open the gate.
Open the gate.
Welcome.
Welcome, sirs.
Welcome.
What the fuck?
Welcome.
Welcome.
Our honest feast and hospitality
is always at the disposal
of the Holy Brotherhood.
One of our patrols
was attacked.
Vicious prisoners
are on the loose.
We have a desss...
Description.
...cription.
We'll ferret out any
criminal here, sir.
Perhaps we may even find a
Jew or two into the bargain.
Show yourselves!
Show yourself!
Bail out
Sancho?
Come out in the
name of the Holy...
You have nothing to hide.
You have nothing to fear.
Sancho, where are you?
San... hmm?
Ah, a weapon.
Fasten up your weapons.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, ye!
Come on, ye!
Sancho, help me!
Malambrino, the enchanter,
and his evil minions are here.
They are come for me!
Sancho!
Where are you going?
We have to talk,
my lying friend.
Here.
Stop!
Murder?
Murder!
Bolt the doors!
My work!
- My work!
- Stop!
Stop!
You must stop!
I will kill you!
No, no, no, no!
Jesus Christ Almighty!
It's time to go.
Hey!
Stop!
It's him!
It's him!
Ahh!
It's him!
Hola.
- Hello.
- Out here.
OK.
All right.
Out here.
You sleep well?
Did you sleep well?
Yes.
Come on.
Come with me.
Come with me.
And while I
held the enchanters at bay
with my mighty sword,
Sancho, my loyal squire,
boldly attacking the
vile forces of darkness
with only a basket for a helmet.
And so we saved the castle.
I think you were
frightened last night
by those sweet Moroccans.
They are just poor people.
Illegal. Your friend,
he lifts their spirits.
He's a saint.
He's insane.
That story you
were telling them,
with the basket on my head
and you fighting enchanters.
That was my dream last night.
Oh, why does everything always
have to be about you, Sancho?
You are so childlike,
so self-centered... me,
me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
OK.
Adios, you old fucking fart.
If you ever find
your Lady Dulcinea,
you can shove her up your ass.
They'll point me to
the nearest town.
I've got transport.
This will be a marvelous
day for adventure, Sancho.
It mayhap that before
six days pass together,
I shall conquer
several kingdoms.
And I shall crown you
king of one of them.
King Sancho, astonishing
things attend the profession
of a knight-errant.
Oh, ugh!
Fuck!
Leave it, Sancho.
You can eat it later.
Spanish gold?
Spanish gold.
Hey, Don!
Take a look at this.
Fuck him.
He won't have a clue what these
are worth in today's market.
No, no.
I'll take them to the police.
I'll turn myself in.
They'll see I'm an honest guy.
They'll believe me when I
explained what happened.
Yes.
No.
No, I'm going to need
a very good lawyer.
I'm going to hide them.
Mine.
All mine!
No!
No!
No!
Huh?
Uh, hello.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Whoa.
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I come in peace.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just... you wouldn't happen
to know where the exit is
would you?
I don't believe it.
What?
It's you.
It is, yes.
I hope so.
You don't recognize me?
Sorry, no, I don't.
I'd like to.
You've changed, Toby.
Was it a party?
Or some bar?
I... I would have been
too young for some bar.
OK.
Oh, holy fucking shit.
Yes, of course.
I know you.
Miss Natural Moonlight
Shampoo campaign.
I won the premier award in '09.
Did I get it right?
Is that you, Sally?
You've got the year right.
I was 15 years old.
15?
That wasn't me.
You made me a promise.
OK.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I think you got the wrong guy.
I could be someone, you said.
Definitely wrong man.
I could be a star.
I just needed to be me.
That was all.
Angelica?
Angelica.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
No.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Holy shit.
I can't believe it's you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh god.
You stink.
I was just watching the
film we made the other day.
I hadn't seen it in a long time.
You were so young.
Not that you're old now.
You're still very young.
I heard you went to Madrid.
Yes.
Madrid and Barcelona
and Marseilles...
a lot of places.
A village girl can't
go back to a little bar
after starring in a movie.
Things didn't work out?
Modeling, mostly escort work.
Isn't it beautiful here?
It's my favorite place on earth.
My father would bring
me here on my birthdays.
He said the cave was a
secret entrance to heaven
for all the poor people.
And in the waterfall
was an angel.
I fucked things up
for you, didn't I?
Don't flatter yourself.
You think I wanted to
do laundry all my life?
I'm doing OK now.
Life's good.
But someone special in my life...
Someone who does this.
- Comes with the territory.
- OK.
Sorry.
Why?
It's a living.
Same as you.
I don't get beaten up.
Ow!
Fuck!
Sancho.
Forgive him, gracious madam.
He's an ignorant peasant
who knows no better.
I am Don Quixote de la
Mancha at your service.
Of course you are.
Please arise, sir knight.
Oh.
I know of your famous exploits.
And I know of your quest
for your Lady Dulcinea.
Why are you talking like that?
I know that this gentleman
has the courtliness
of a true knight.
A rustic, huh?
I heard that.
Oh, such ears.
Perhaps he caught
something from his donkey.
Huh, Sancho?
Yes.
Sancho was always so stubborn.
So greedy.
So mesmerizing...
a real enchanted.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Don't say that.
- Enchanter?
- Oh, yes.
- What?
Sancho?
No, not enchanter.
Not enchanter!
Sancho, is this you?
Speak.
Of course it is!
I mean, I'm not Sancho.
I'm a...
Malambrino, the enchanter,
the fiend in disguise.
Wait, wait, wait.
You know what?
I'm fucking Sancho.
You don't recognize my face?
I'm Sancho.
Sancho?
She didn't say enchanter.
She said... she said...
she said chanter.
I said enchanter.
I'm a chanter...
Cantor... Eddie Cantor...
Eddie Cantor, only not
totally Jewish looking.
Fuck it!
If you knew
Susie like I know Susie...
oh, oh, oh, what a gal.
There's none so classy
as this fair lassie...
oh, oh, oh my goodness,
what a chassis.
We went riding.
She didn't balk.
From the country, I'm
the one that had to walk.
If you knew Susie
like I know Susie...
Oh, oh, what a gal!
Oh, oh.
You had me worried for
a moment there, Sancho.
I have to go.
- Goodbye, Toby.
- No.
Stay, dear lady.
No, no, I'll come with you.
No, no, no, no.
She needs a true
escort, a knight.
Step aside.
Gracious lady.
Let me help your foot.
Let me help you.
Get your hand off her, Sancho.
Hey!
Hah!
You touched her with
your filthy peasant hands.
Filthy?
You're the dirty old man.
How dare you say that to me.
- I'll thrash you for that!
- All right.
Stop, stop, stop.
What?
We should follow her.
I think she needs our help.
Love is a cruel
jailer, Sancho.
What?
Did you see the
look in her eyes?
Oh, let me guess?
She fell in love with you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a curse, Sancho.
It's a curse.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Can't these things
go any faster?
How are we going to
follow them like this?
Sancho, a knight-errant, he
wanders, he roams, he seeks.
He never follows.
Heeya, heeya.
Angelica's scarf.
Shit.
We'll never find her now.
It's a heaven-sent
blessing, Sancho.
We have a quest.
A what?
A quest.
- An impossible quest.
- Oh, great.
Listen, Sancho.
Do you hear that?
The call of the Muezzin.
The what?
The Muslim call to prayer.
Listen, Sancho.
Sancho, listen.
Oh, Sancho.
We are on hallowed
ground, Sancho.
Bow your head, Sancho.
Bow your head.
Sancho, bow your head.
Our Christ has brought us to Al
Hazzaharaha, the last citadel
of the Moorish kings.
And there, do you see?
There they are.
The wise chorus in their
robes of white, their heads
bowed in prayer to Allah.
Those are sheep.
You ignorant
peasant, why speak
badly of them just because
they worship a heathen god.
Oh, Sancho,
follow me with humility.
Al Zagal the
great Moorish warrior
once trod these
magnificent halls.
Who knows?
Perhaps these wise men
know of the lady we seek.
Great.
Then can we just get
out of the fucking sun.
Sancho, they are welcoming us.
Oh no, gentlemen.
There is no need to bow.
I am just a poor Christian
knight on a quest.
In the perfumed
court to the sultan,
the days are passed
in sweet music
and gentle delights
with gracious noblemen
and courtly ladies.
I'm starving!
Well then eat, Sancho.
Food makes a
peasant's heart glad.
What's this?
Wha... oh, a conundrum.
Is this one of your
riddles, Sancho?
Oh, I like a riddle.
Oh, what is this?
Let's see.
It's a... it's a horse and cart.
Is that it?
I mean what's in it?
What's in it.
Mm, let's see.
It's a got a goose...
or a wild hippogriff?
You're pathetic.
Yeah.
It would be easy
if I was, Sancho.
It would be easy if I were
allowed to be an old man.
But I am bound to honor
the code of knight-errant.
Well chivalry
is dead and gone.
I'm very sorry.
It probably never
existed anyway.
Oh never
was there a knight
so sad as he who lost his love...
Shut the fuck up!
...love.
My servant calls to...
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
But
foolishly he leaves
his horse behind the quest...
Sancho.
Oh, most beauteous and
cruel hearted maiden,
must you allow your captive
knight to waste and perish
in this endless wandering?
Dead and gone, Sancho?
Release me
from my enchantment.
It is not enough
that I've forced
even the famous Don
Quixote of la Mancha
- to kneel to your beauty.
- Que?
Who's there?
A knight-errant accompanied
by his loyal squirrel,
Sancho Panza.
It's squire...
loyal squire!
Accompanied by his line
squirrel, Sancho Panza.
Sir, I doubt if you'll
vanquish the real Don Quixote.
Somebody impersonating
him, perhaps?
For a full day
and night, I pulled
Don Quixote hand to hand.
Finally, forced him to submit
and bow down to my lady.
Liar.
I am the real Don
Quixote in person.
You doubt my word, old man?
You'd do better to
return to your bed.
It's essential when faced with
the purity of a true knight,
the false knight retreats.
He's probably wet himself.
Would
you shut the fuck up?
It's time to go.
Yes.
Let the conquered be at
the mercy of the conqueror.
Agreed.
I'm bound by the
laws of chivalry.
Agreed.
This is ridiculous.
No, my old friend.
No.
Do not be afraid.
We have been through
far worse, my friend.
Sancho, come heel,
make a stirrup.
My lance, Sancho.
Thanks.
Don't do this.
You can get seriously hurt.
Thank you, my loyal...
my loyal squire.
I entrust my heart
to my Lady Dulcinea.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
What are the rules
about squires?
Like what's the deal
if you get killed?
Ahh!
I'll have you, knight!
- What about me?
- Wait.
You're a coward.
You sniveling,
chicken-livered, peasant!
So self-centered...
me, me, me, me.
Stop, Rocinante!
Stop!
Yes!
Oh!
Oh, oh.
He's not dead.
- He's not fucking dead.
- Ahh!
- He's not dead.
- No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don.
Don.
Yield, sir knight, or field
the sword of Don Quixote de la
Mancha rammed up to your teeth.
- Don, Don, Don, Don.
- Stop him!
Stop!
They're going to kill him.
- Stop it.
- Yield!
Don.
All right.
I yield.
I yield.
That's good.
You promise to pay
homage to my Lady Dulcinea?
I promise.
You promise to tell
her of my courage?
- I promise.
- Of my bravery?
I promise.
Of... of my love?
Yeah.
Yeah, I swear.
I swear on my blood, I promise.
Raul?
- Raul Fernandez?
- Yeah.
It's me.
I... I...
I... my friends.
Uh, wha... what are
you doing here?
Padre.
Why aren't you at
home in the village?
Ah, ah, ah... what's happening?
Keep away!
Keep away!
Enchantments, spells.
I won't go back.
I won't go back.
You can't blind me
with your mirrors.
Please, come home.
Agh!
Keep away!
You are the one
who make him crazy.
Shit.
What did I do?
You see what a dangerous
child you've created?
Javier, come back!
We have to act
out his fantasies
to bring him home before
he causes more damages,
and now we lost him.
Well, he's my ride.
So what do you think I feel?
You and your film
destroyed good people!
Destroyed my
beautiful daughter.
Sancho, what's happening?
They taking you
up to your village.
You'll be safe there.
No.
I will die there.
Help me, Sancho.
Help me, Sancho.
Sorry.
I can't.
Sancho.
Oh, corte.
Stop.
What are you doing, Angelica?
Get out of the shot.
What am I going to do with you?
OK, fine.
Put light around her eyes.
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Musica.
Good.
Nice.
Taller.
Good.
Very nice.
Good attitude.
Film ran out.
Film ran out!
Gracias...
Very nice.
Very nice.
Ow!
Oh, oh, oh.
Are you going to
rescue me, Toby?
Are you going to make
everything all right?
Mmm.
Aaagh.
Aaagh.
Mmm.
Aaagh.
Fuck me!
Where is everybody?
Did the old man come back?
Habla Inglés?
OK.
Who the
fuck wrote this ending?
Can someone please tell me
what I did to deserve this?
At least I'll have died rich.
I shall
saw myself in half
with teeth of wild boars.
Ow!
I shall crush mountains.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Ow.
I shall throw myself naked
from the highest cliff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ahh.
I shall tear down trees
with my bare teeth.
Don?
I shall crush
mountains with my fists.
What the
hell are you doing?
My penance.
I have not done enough
to show how immeasurable
my love for Dulcinea can be.
Oh.
I shall go crazy for love.
Oh, oh, ahh!
Stop.
Stop.
Don't be ridiculous.
Not so tight, please.
Ahh.
You don't understand,
Sancho, do you, huh?
Hmm?
If she can see how crazed
I can be without a cause,
think how crazed that she will
imagine I can be with one.
Run that past me again.
Oh, Sancho.
Sancho, you must go to her.
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
Stop.
Stop.
This is insane.
Insane?
Are you sure?
Yes.
You're not just
trying to please me?
No.
And you're not trying to worm
your way back into my service?
What?
Jesus fucking Christ,
you are fucking gone.
Doolally! Fucked up
and fucking crackers.
Oh, Sancho.
Sancho!
Oh, Sancho, Sancho.
Thank you so much, man.
Oh, Sancho.
What if your friends were
who they said they were?
Oh.
The enchanters have got
their talons into you, hmm?
Never doubt, Sancho.
That's what they want you to do.
We must always
believe in ourselves,
ahh, whatever the cost.
It is our story, Sancho,
not some pretend...
Sancho, my son.
Great fortune smiles on us.
Behold, I am rewarded
for my penance.
My fair lady has forgiven me.
Go to her, Sancho.
Tell her that Don
Quixote de la Mancha,
her knight of the
mournful countenance,
humbly awaits her command.
Wait.
How am I supposed to say that?
Have you learned
nothing at my side, hmm?
Uh, hello there.
Your highness, fair... fair...
fair huntress, lofty
majesty, my master...
my master begged me...
Lady Dulcinea, my
master begged me...
Toby?
What?
- It is you.
- Jacqui?
Ah, ah.
No, no.
- Stop, stop.
- That's all right.
- I'm pulling you back up.
- It's OK.
He works for us.
It's OK.
Where have you been?
We've been very
worried about you.
You look terrible.
I'm in trouble.
Yeah, we heard.
But don't worry
about the police.
Alexei has the
law by the balls around here.
Alexei?
Alexei Miisken,
the Vodka account.
We're all staying with him.
Tonight's the Holy
Week Festival.
And he's throwing a big
costume party, lots of games.
You'll love it.
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Oh, uh, I'm not alone.
Oh.
You found your star.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Trouble is now he actually
believes he's Don Quixote.
Perfect.
He's just what we need tonight,
something truly authentic.
How sweet.
No, it's actually really sad.
He... he really needs help.
Oh... oh no.
Please don't go all
sentimental on us now, Toby.
This is going to be fun.
I'm still very angry
with you, you know?
You better be extra nice to me.
Tally-ho.
You do know that's not
your Dulcinea, right?
What made you think she was.
I'm beginning to worry
about you, Sancho.
You'd better behave.
Don't be nervous, Sancho.
This is our reward for all
the pain we have endured.
Did I not say I would
make you a king?
Welcome to you, Don
Quixote, the flower and
cream of knight-errantry.
Please be so kind as to
accept our hospitality
and grace our palace
with your famed presence.
Sancho, heel.
What's the matter with it?
Sancho, get me down.
Heel.
Remember your place.
Oww!
Oww!
Oh, Sancho!
Hmm.
Where the fuck have
you been, Golden Boy?
You, get out of here.
Skedaddle.
I'm trying to clench
this fucking deal.
The agency is on my back.
And I'm playing games in this
Disney nightmare, full fucking
drag, eating and
drinking like I'm Elvis,
humoring that
Russian prick Alexei.
Yeah, you're going to meet him.
Try to keep up with the plot.
There's a plot?
He needs constant
entertainment.
Think pure id, think
toddler on a sugar rush,
think fucking Trump.
Alexei, my prodigal director
has returned from the wild,
and your Tobias Grummett.
Mm, I have heard many
things about you, Toby.
You are, how do you say,
the creative stock buttocks?
He certainly is.
He would sell your
market to the Muslims.
And the old man?
He's, uh... he's a face that...
I just thought he would
make a good Quixote.
And I see he's fond of you.
Oh yeah.
He's... he's an old man
with nothing better to do.
- And you look after him.
- What?
No.
No?
Toby...
Toby, I see everything...
everything.
I envy you.
You met Angelica when...
when she was so young.
Oh.
No, uh, it... it
wasn't like that.
Did I ask you
anything, my sweet?
We were both very young.
It was um... a...
a student film.
If you
could call it that.
I mean, you can't call it...
...very much a student
passion project.
Hmm?
A passion project.
And what part did Angelica
play in this passion
project of yours?
She was...
she was a girl.
- A girl?
- Yeah.
Just a girl?
Yeah, that's it.
We never...
never gave her a name.
No.
- She has to be a movie star.
- Sure.
Oh, um, yeah.
I can't believe I'm saying...
this is not what it looks like.
This... I understand
how the context is...
looks... looks, uh, bad.
But this was not...
I mean, she is
wearing a bra, yes.
But what is in the picture is
not what is actually happening.
I mean, it's happening,
but it's not...
Stop talking.
Ugh.
No.
Clean it up.
Clean it up.
Here, come here.
I'll do it.
Do it now.
Oh.
Here... in case you
spill anything else.
Angelica.
What are you doing here?
Go away.
What do you want?
To rescue me?
Well, yeah.
From what?
From that Russian pig, from
this, from this, all of this.
Yes, I see.
I see what you mean.
It is a little extravagant,
far too beautiful.
But I'm getting used to it.
Toby, I am happy here.
I have everything
you promised I would.
So you're just going to
let him treat you like that?
He was reminding
me who I belong to.
That's all.
Do you have the cojones to
steal Alexei's property?
Yeah.
Didn't think so.
Fuck you.
Only Alexei does that.
OK.
Then how much?
Huh?
What's you're going rate?
Is that enough?
Huh?
Hey!
What the fuck?
You naughty boy.
They're not real.
Are things real, Toby?
Come on, Toby.
Pull yourself together.
You're making me nervous.
Something has to be.
The Boss has put me in charge
of tonight's entertainment.
- Rupert.
- I had this peachy idea.
It's like kid of the
one you used to have.
- Rupert.
- You're going to love it.
- Rupert.
- What is it?
- Rupert.
- What is it?
I'm listening.
Would you mind just
rubbing my back, please?
You know like you used to... a
little hard grain kneading...
kneaded to be worn down.
Hey, come on.
I think you'll feel a lot
better once we get you dressed.
Come on.
Who do you want to play?
Oh, thank you.
I hope you like
my humble home.
Oh, it's... it's...
it's wonders.
Yes.
I bought it two weeks ago.
Huh?
I'm joking.
I was thinking painting
it all in purple.
We Russians love purple.
Now, I really like your big
adventures, Don Quixote.
You've read my exploits?
Of course.
The whole castle
is reading them.
Book!
Take a seat.
I hope this little show
of yours pleases me.
Hi, Toby.
Um, we need to talk.
Not now, Sarah.
Down.
Stay.
Melissa.
Make some room
for Sancho, my dear.
Alexei seems to be
enjoying the old fart.
Well, good.
Is that the gypsy?
All a misunderstanding, Toby.
A lady is here in the hope of
finding the brave and noble Don
Quixote.
I am the lady Dolorida,
Princess of Candaya.
I cast myself down before
knighthood invincible.
Oh, please.
Please.
It is I who should be
kneeling before you.
Please, dear sad lady,
tell me your story.
Mine is an ancient
Muslim family,
who, when the Catholic monarchs
expelled the Moors from Spain,
fled to Morocco.
They were poor.
But as years passed,
they grew rich.
And I... I was
raised in splendor.
I was exceedingly beautiful.
I... I was desired by all men.
Then one day, a filthy
beggar came to my palace,
demanding my hand in marriage.
No.
Commanding me to
convert to Christianity.
Can you imagine?
My... my ladies and I burst
out laughing, enraged.
The pathetic creature's
eyes burned fire.
And cursing us,
he spat out his...
his name... Malambrino.
Malambrino, the
enchanter, my sworn enemy?
My skin was suddenly
pricked by 1,000 needles.
And as I raised my
hands to my face, I...
I found it...
I found it like this.
Oh my god!
- Suicide bomber!
- Run!
Freeze!
Everything
is under control.
Calm down.
I'm sure that Don
can deal with this.
Hmm?
Yeah.
Dear lady, what
must I do to release
you from this abominable curse?
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
Oh.
Oh.
I knew you would not fail us.
Hut!
I don't...
I don't like this.
This must seem
like heaven to a person
such as yourself, huh?
Trust me.
I know these people.
How dare you
suggest such a thing.
You will remain silent.
You do nothing
without permission.
Let anyone who is brave
enough mount this machine.
Don't do it.
Sancho!
Sit down!
With a cruel
knight on his back,
Cabalino flies through
the air, so easily
it is as if the devil
himself is guiding it.
Dear
lady, I am ready.
Where must I travel to release
you from this evil curse?
To the moon and back.
Because of the
extreme altitude,
the rider must take
care to cover his eyes.
Then I shall blind
myself securely.
Hut!
May God guide
you, brave knight!
I can't see him anymore!
He's so high!
He's gone!
He's alive!
We must have reached
the second layer of air,
where hail and snow are born.
No, now it's thunder
and lightning.
We have surely risen
to the third layer.
Oh.
In a moment, we
shall reach the moon.
I can feel its cool aura.
Don Quixote de la Mancha,
the moon welcomes you!
I recognize that voice...
Malambrino!
Ah, yes, Malambrino.
What a surprise.
It seems you have succeeded,
and so I must lift my curse.
You win this time,
sad little man!
How dare you!
Surely, I am the first to have
made this stupendous journey.
Just the first...
after me.
Then prepare to be eclipsed,
and watch how I can fly, higher
than you can ever dream of...
to the sun!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoa.
Whoa.
Cabalino, slow down.
Cabalino, slow down!
No, no, no, no, no.
Humor him.
I need to clinch this account.
Tremendous.
It's too hot!
Ahh!
Whoa!
Ahh!
Dear ladies, I am back.
You are free.
There is... there is
no need to thank me.
Congratulations.
I think we just
made the account.
You old fool!
What must they have
thought of you?
I could only find black thread.
You think they'll notice?
Yeah.
It'll be fine.
Next time, Sancho, make
sure I listen to you.
I'll try.
Goodnight, sire.
Toby, I...
You've humiliated him.
You could have stopped it.
You didn't.
Isn't she wonderful?
So dramatic.
So Spanish.
I promised her a big part in the
Vodka campaign, if we got it.
And we did!
What a team!
Come on, partner, give us a hug.
You see what they
are doing here?
Gathering up all the things...
broken things, bad things...
tonight, we sacrifice
the past year.
Everything will be destroyed in
the flames, made clean again.
Angelica.
What the fuck are you doing?
It's not my fault.
The valves are corroded.
Angelica.
Angelica.
Angelica, would you talk to me?
Oh, you like being
kept like an animal?
Paid for?
Alexei's whore?
Oh, go ahead.
I probably deserve it.
He's going to kill us both.
We'll be gone before he knows.
- Which one?
- There.
The one before the white horse.
Oh, shit!
Hah!
Toby, come on.
Let's go.
I can't.
Come on, Don.
We're getting out of here.
A proper guest must be
willing to repay his host.
No, no, no.
You are a knight-errant.
You rescue damsels, right?
Well, we have to now.
No!
Leave me alone.
You told me to make
you listen to me, right?
Well, we got to go.
Toby.
Now.
Come on, man.
The enchanters are upon us.
I like it here.
No, you don't.
Everyone's happy here.
We have to go.
No, they're not.
It's what I dream of.
Toby!
- You're pathetic.
- Go!
Toby!
Help!
- Toby!
- Yaw!
Yaw!
Yaw!
Oh!
Toby.
Toby.
Toby.
Angelica?
Toby.
What did you think
you were doing?
- Oh!
- Shh.
You fucking prick.
Such sticky fingers.
Time someone took that
girl in hand, huh?
Well, I can't help, Toby.
Got a company to run.
Lots of people depend on me.
You're sure in
sad spirits, Sancho.
Crazed and in love.
I was proud of you.
But it's over.
It's time to go home.
What are you saying?
Sancho, look into my eyes.
There are no birds in
last Autumn's nest.
No.
Sancho.
No, get away from me.
- Get away from me!
- Wait.
Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica.
Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!
Alexei!
Where are you, you
son of a bitch?
You piece of shit!
Angelica!
Angelica!
I can take you to her.
Get down.
Trust me.
Angelica.
Are you all right?
Got to make up for lost time.
I'll make you forget
about that little bitch.
Angelica.
You better come.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Angelica!
Angelica!
Oh my god.
Angelica!
I'm The Boss's wife.
Toby!
Kiss me!
Kiss me.
I'd send that little
bitch straight to hell.
She's burning!
Shit!
He's killing her!
No!
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Dammit.
Every
man for himself.
Oh, no, no.
Ahh!
Oh.
Don!
Don!
I'm here.
My name...
my name is Javier.
No, no, no, no.
Is Javier Sanchez, a
shoemaker,
a forgotten old man.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't say that.
An interesting face, the kind
they use to sell insurance.
Please.
Please.
Here.
You, you...
I always knew you...
you were more than...
more than Sancho.
An accident.
Old men can trip so easily.
This is no more fun.
You go away.
Get out of my house.
Melissa!
No, Sarah.
Ah, whatever.
This is the one month
they said it never rains.
Really buggers up the
rest of the shoot, Tob.
You really do play
too rough, my dear.
Not willing to let you go past.
Yeah.
Yeah, right now.
I could get behind it now.
Trust me.
Let's work together.
Don?
He said he couldn't die.
The village is not far now.
We're almost there.
We'll make sure they bury
him in all his glory.
You can trust me.
Everything is going
to be all right.
Everything's fine.
This is a marvelous
day for adventure.
Toby?
I feel it in my bones.
What's that?
Just thunder.
Something's coming.
Run!
Get out of here!
Leave this place!
Stay back!
You're in grave danger!
Yaw!
Toby!
Toby, come back!
Prepare to meet your doom!
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Oh!
Oh!
Whoa!
Ahhh!
- Eeyahh!
- Wah!
I entrust my heart and
soul to you, my Dulcinea!
Die, foul being!
Toby!
Toby.
Toby.
Toby.
Toby.
Toby.
There you are,
my loyal squire.
It's me.
It's Angelica.
Sancho?
Toby.
Toby, I... I'm not Sancho Panza.
Oh, you and
your rustic pranks.
Some say I'm mad, that I
only inhabit my dreams.
But then how is it
I see you, Sancho?
It's Angelica.
Always doubting me.
Alexei's whore, remember?
I forgive you, Sancho.
No, no, no, no.
No, Toby.
Toby.
Toby, ple... please, it's me.
It's me.
Please.
Toby, I'm... I'm here.
It's me.
Toby.
No.
It's me.
I'm Sancho... Sancho Panza,
your... your loyal squire.
Sancho?
Sancho, this is the beginning
of a very interesting
and new relationship.
I was born
by special will of heaven,
in this age of Iram, to restore
the lost age of chivalry.
I am
the man for whom all dangers
are expressly reserved and
grand adventures and brave deeds
also.
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha,
and I will live forever.
