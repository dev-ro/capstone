Which Gate
Did She Say?
Oh, Dear,
I Don'T Know!
Let'S Wait Here.
Gee.
Oh, Look!
Is That A Bird?
No. It'S A Plane.
Maybe This Is
The Wrong Airport.
But How Can An Airport
Be Wrong?
I Think We Should
Go To The Snack Bar.
I Want
A Bird Dog, Daddy.
Yeah, A Bird Dog!
Oh, I Hate To Think
Of Him Being Lost.
He'S Only
6 Years Old.
Oops!
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse Me.
Was There
A Big Yellow Bird
On This Plane?
Well, Only Me.
Oh, Too Bad!

Canary Row.
Where Are We Going?
Where Are You Taking Me?

Marie: Here We Are.
Well, We Made It.
I Told You I Could Find It.

Oh, Hey,

Big Bird! Come On!
Everyone Come On!
What'S He Say?
What'S He Say?
Uh...
He Starts,
"Dear Friends..."
Uhh.
"Here I Am In My New Home.
"It Sure Is
A Lot Different
"From My Nest
On Sesame Street.
"The Dodos
Are A Nice Family.
"They Live
In A Birdhouse
With A Big Front Lawn.
"They Spend A Lot Of Time
There Digging For Worms.
"They Never Seem
To Find Any,
But They Love To Do It."
Gee, I Don'T See
Any Worms Here.
"The Dodos
Have Lots Of Great Things
Like A Lawn Mower
You Can Ride On."
"I'M Not Sure They Know
How To Use It Right,
"But Nobody'S Perfect.
"The Dodos Like
To Stay In Shape.
Every Morning,
We Do Our Exercises."
Woman On Television:
Come Up Off The Floor,
And Start Jogging
In Place.
Left And Right.
Yippee! Yippee!
Look At Me,
Mommy.
Yippee!
Whoo-Hoo!
I'M Getting Tired.
Don'T Stop, Daddy.
Pressing It Down.
I Need A Rest.
Four More.
Hold On.
Three More.
Come On. Get Tough.
Two More And...
Cross Your Hands
In Front.
"Sometimes,
After A Hard Workout,
We Take A Dip
In The Pool."
## By The Sea,
By The Sea ##
"Now, That'S Fun."
Aah!
Aah!
"Well, It'S Time
To Go To Sleep Now."
Well, Uh,
Good Night.
[Kisses]
Ohh.
Ahem.
"So That'S My New Home."
Night.
"I Should Be Happy Here."
"What'S Wrong With Me?"
"Love, Bigdodo"?
Big Dodo?
"Big Bird To You."
Oh, Dear.
Sounds Like
Bird Needs Me.
I Know.
I'Ll Write Him
A Postcard
And Ask If It'S Ok
To Come Visit Now.
Hmm.
Hey, I'Ve Got
A Great Idea.
Let'S Play
Make-Believe.
I'Ll Be Snow White.
Donny: But You'Re
Not Snow White.
Marie: You'Re
Bright Yellow.
Yeah!
Well--And You Could Be
The Seven Dwarfs.
But We'Re
Not Dwarfs.
We'Re...Birds.
I Said
We Just Could Make Believe.
You Know, Pretend,
Use Your Imagination.
Oh, Ok.
I'Ll Pretend
I'M Donny!
And I'Ll Pretend
I'M Marie.
Ha Ha Ha!
Boy, This Is Swell!
I Like This Game.
What A Great Time!
[Doorbell Rings]
Get The Door, Marie.
No Way. Uh-Uh.
Go On. Get The Door.
Get The Door.
Go Get It.
Nope. Uh-Uh.
Don'T Be Stubborn.
## I'M Not
Gonna Get It ##
Get The Door, Marie!
Never Mind.
I'Ll Get It.
Oh. Hi, Mr. Postman.
Post Card For, Uh,
Mr., Uh, Big Bird.
Big Bird?
Hey, That'S Me!
Oh, Boy! I Wonder
Who It'S From.
I Don'T Know,
But I Hope
He'S Not Sending You
Any Packages.
Oh, Yeah!
Bye-Bye!
Let'S See.
It Says, "Dear Bird."
That'S Me.
It Goes On.
"I Am Ready
To Come And Visit.
Your Best Friend,
Mr. Snuffleupagus."
Oh, Snuffy.
Who'S Mr. Snuff--
Snuff--
Snuff--
Snuffleupagus.
Yeah.
He'S My Best Friend.
What Kind
Of A Bird Is He?
He'S Not A Bird.
He'S A Snuffleupagus.
Snuffleguppygus.
Snuffleguppygus.
But Your Best Friend
Should Be A Bird.
Why?
Because
You Are A Bird.
Isn'T That
Right, Daddy?
That'S Right,
Mommy.
You Should Be With
Your Own Kind. Birds!
You'Ll Find Lots Of
Birds Your Own Age.
And Make Some New
Best Friends.
Now Come On Out
And Hunt For Worms.
But I Don'T Want
To Hunt Worms.
I Want Snuffy
To Come And Visit,
And If He Can'T
Come And Visit,
I Don'T Want
To Be Here Anymore.
I Want To Go Home.
But You Are Home.
Ha Ha Ha!

Let'S Have A Few Words
With Miss Finch
Of The Feathered
Friends.
Excuse Me, Miss Finch.
You Sent Big Bird To
The Dodos, Didn'T You?
Yes. I Found Him
A Lovely Home.
And Why Was That?
Because He Belongs
With His Own Kind.
What Kind Is That?
Birds.
Hmm. Yes. Well,
Why Do You Suppose He
Ran Away From Home?
I Can'T Imagine.
Quiet!
Such A Lovely Home.
Such A Lovely Family.
We At The Feathered Friends
Take Such Pride In Finding
The Right Environment
For Homeless
Birdlings.
You Think Maybe
He Didn'T Like It Here
Or Something?
Impossible.
Hmm.
Well, What Are You
Going To Do
About It,
Ms. Finch?
I'M Going To Find Big Bird,
Wherever He Is,
And Bring Him Back
To The Dodos.
Well, You Heard It

Ah!
Telly, It'S Gonna Be
All Right.
Oh, Olivia. I'M So Worried
About Big Bird.
Well, Don'T!
He'S Out There
All Alone,
And Miss Finch
Could Get Him.
Not If We
Find Him First,
And Believe Me,
Telly, We Will.
Isn'T That Right?
Yeah!
All Right, Listen,
Everybody.
Here'S The Plan.
We'Re Here...
And Big Bird Is Here,
Heading Toward
Sesame Street.
We Hope.
Ok.

Now, If You Get There
And You Haven'T Found Him,

Any Questions?
Yes, I Have A Question.
What Is It, Oscar?
What Is The Capital
Of South Dakota?
Oh, Oscar.
Oscar, If You Don'T Want
To Go On This Trip,
You Don'T Have To.
Are You Kidding?
I Love Wild Goose Chases.
Let'S Go Get Lost.

That 8-Foot Bird'S
Still On The Lam.
You Know, Sid, People Would
Pay Money To See That Bird.
Nah, I Wouldn'T Pay
To See No Bird.
No, No, No. People Would Payus
To See That Bird.
Us, Us, Us!
Hey!
Hey,
Let Me Down!
If You Wanna Get Down It'Ll
Cost You Another Nickel.
It'S 10 Cents
For The Round Trip, Kid.
10 Cents?!
What A Rip-Off.
You Stole
My Apple.
Is That So?
That'S My Apple.
Well, This Ain'T

I Don'T Know.
I Just May Have
To Use My Brain.
Thanks A Lot.
Hey, Good Luck.
Thank You.
You Know What?
You'Re Gonna Make
It Home Just Fine.
Ok.
