Sir, it's 30 minutes past the
expected communication time.
Yes. We've failed tonight.
They protected themselves against the unbeliever.
Am I the unbeliever?
That's right. You're the only outsider here.
But...
We shouldn't have let you record our messages.
Do you believe in flying saucers?
Not really, but I'm interested.
Interested, but you don't really believe.
They've sensed your mistrust through your brain waves.
My brain waves? I'm sorry, but I can't believe that.
But you must admit some strange things have occurred lately.
What month is it?
It's January.
Right, it's midwinter.
But feel how hot it is.
The papers have been reporting a heatwave.
Doesn't that worry you?
Strange things have been occurring not only in our
own galaxy, but in the extra-galactic systems too.
Next you'll be saying the Earth will explode soon.
I don't think it'll explode. But something
terrible is going to happen.
We wanted to ask the UFOs and warn the world.
Look! It's a flying saucer!
It's a shooting star.
Another one over there!
There too!
You're working late. Anything happening?
The papers get the news quicker
than the police these days.
The boss wants me to have a drink with him.
Want to join us?
No way, I don't want to be preached at.
So many sirens tonight. What's going on?
Don't you know? There's an epidemic.
An epidemic? In the middle of winter?
The calendar says it's winter, but things have changed.
Yes, it's complicated. Look, another one!
Another? What is it?
We keep getting meteor showers,
everywhere in the world.
It's getting strange. The Earth is going mad.
"HEATWAVE CAUSES FURTHER DAMAGE"
"TEMPERATURE REACHES 28 DEGREES.
PEOPLE SWIMMING AT NEW YEAR"
Sorry to keep you waiting, Shindo.
I couldn't get through to Selgina.
Selgina?
That's right, the small country between the two worlds.
Princess Maas Doulina Salno, 
is coming to Japan unofficially.
I want you to be her bodyguard.
Me?
It's an unofficial visit. They don't want any protocol.
What's she here for? Sightseeing?
According to our sources, there is a plot to assassinate her.
She's the heir to the throne.
That's why she's leaving Selgina.
Sounds like a big job. When is she arriving?
Her plane's already left.
Already?
That's her.
- Has the princess left?
- Yes sir.
The device?
Carefully planted. She'll never come back alive.
Good work.
What are you looking at, your highness?
I feel as if I can reach the stars.
You should go to bed now.
Not yet. I want something to drink first.
Standup. Leave this place.
You must leave now.
Escape.
Escape.
Escape!
Your highness!
Kurobe Dam. The terminal.
Professor Murai from the Geological Institute?
Yes, how do you do?
Welcome. We've had many shooting stars lately.
The one last night was enormous.
It fell over Mount Kurodake at a 60-degree angle.
Never seen anything so bright.
Lucky it didn't hit the dam.
- Where did it fall?
- Here.
- Around Kasumizawa?
- That's right.
The air currents are bad here.
Helicopters can't fly to the valley.
The only way is over the bridge and
through the mountain trail.
There it is.
What is it?
It's supposed to point to the south-east.
That's because the sun is there.
My compass points north.
Must be a cheap compass.
What? Mine is the same.
What does it mean?
Professor, there it is!
It's so impressive!
Let's camp here.
Unload your rucksacks.
We can get water there.
When is the princess arriving?
Forget it.
Why's that?
Her plane exploded in mid-air.
Exploded? Was it the work of the assassins?
We don't know.
Any clues?
Not even the Foreign Ministry has any clues.
It's tragic that she should become the
victim of a power struggle isn't it.
Here.
"But you must admit some strange
things have occured lately."
Hey, Naoko!
- Hot news!
- Hot news?
A prophet has appeared.
- A prophet?
- Right.
Great stuff for 'Myths Of
The 20th Century'. Go now!
Here. Take these two tapes to Central Park.
Everyone!
Everyone! Have you ever thought
about the expanding universe?
The time has come for all Earth people to awaken
to their duties as citizens of the universe.
Are you a boy or a girl?
Do a striptease!
She suffers from megalomania.
No wonder. We're having a heatwave
instead of snow this winter.
The Earth is on the brink of destruction.
But you still refuse to take me seriously.
Listen to me!
Where are you from?
Space? Aren't you Japanese?
I come from Jupiter.
Is Jupiter in Africa?
Jupiter is up in the sky.
Are you?
So one can travel in space now? We should go.
You were talking about the destruction of the Earth.
First, a diaster will occur at Mount Aso.
I don't think Mt. Aso has suddenly
become more active.
Nothing will happen there.
Whether she's from Jupiter or not, her
predictions are totally unfounded.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
I'm back.
Welcome. Naoko's just home.
I think she has a new boyfriend.
You think so?
No, it's just a hunch.
That's alright then.
Welcome home. You're home early.
- I saw something very interesting.
- What?
Girl falling for a man with a nice car. Who is he?
Oh, him! Don't be so rude about Professor Murai.
Is Professor Murai your boyfriend?
No way. He's a professor at the university.
That's nice.
Mother, Professor Murai has been to the mountains.
He's investigating the meteorite. He told me about it.
It's a very strange meteorite. Look.
'Myths Of The 20th Century' again?
You're always talking about work.
I need to get lots of stories
before the programme starts.
Turn to Channel 7.
The news.
It's mothers favourite programme.
It's for housewives, but funny.
Hey!
Keep mother happy.
"We present 'What Are They Doing Now?'"
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to 'What Are They Doing Now?".
The programme which...
...give the public the opportunity to meet
the celebrities who have caused a stir in the past.
Now to make their request...
Here are our first guests.
A couple of nice little boys. Come here.
How old are you?
Five.
How cute! He's the same height as you.
Cut it out.
Now, who would you like to see again?
Mothra!
Now that's a surprise! Not easy to arrange.
Impossible?
No... but Mothra...
Liar!
I never tell lies.
Why not call the fairies?
They live with Mothra on Infant Island. Here they are!
I believe you all know these pretty little fairies.
They live with Mothra on Infant Island.
Good evening everyone.
Good evening, boys.
Good evening.
You wanted to ask about Mothra. Go ahead.
Big sisters.
Yes, what is it?
How are the Mothras?
Thank you. However, one of them is dead.
And the other?
He's fine. He's still a baby, but keeps peace on the island.
Would you like to see him?
Then we'll sing his song.
Shut your eyes and you'll see Mothra.
Shut your eyes.
This would make a good story. Don't you think?
Not interested.
Big brother, you must have a dream, otherwise...
He thinks everyone is a thief.
Leave her alone.
Think about your age. You're behaving like children.
"PROPHET PREDICTS DIASTER"
You sent for me, sir?
Look at this.
Latest news from Japan. Are you
sure the princess' plane was destroyed?
I'm positive. I swear.
Then why is she in the paper?
This is impossible.
This girl is not wearing the royal bracelet.
It could be anyone in this picture.
Go to Japan immediately and find out.
I will. And if she is the princess?
Kill her of course.
And if you fail, you'll be killed.
Go!
We've decided to make a
programme about this Jupiter girl.
Especially her predictions for the future.
That should make an interesting programme.
Does that mean the previous stories
will be shelved?
I didn't mean that.
But we'll start the series with
the girl from Jupiter.
But, we don't know where she is.
Then go and find her. You have eyes and legs.
What do you think?
I think it should be an exclusive.
That's right.
She always appears among the
crowds. Look for her there.
She looks very similar.
But, the ambassador said the Princess of Selgina
wears a bracelet on her arm.
Maybe that's why she's in disguise
and says such silly things.
To hide from the assassins.
We must protect her.
We don't have the authority.
Legally, we can't do anything.
Chief, let me do it. I can't
stand this situation.
OK, but you'll have to do it alone.
I'm in Shibuya. Haven't seen her yet.
No sign of her anywhere else?
OK, I'll call you later. Bye.
Brother! Are you loafing?
I'm not like you.
Why, I'm pursuing someone.
That's not very ladylike.
Want to get a drink?
OK. I'm waiting for someone.
Not here yet?
No. You have ten minutes. Then pay and buzz off.
I'm not paying.
Sorry, I was talking to her.
What will you have?
Blue Mountain.
Blue Mountain, please.
Who are you pursuing?
I can't reveal our plan...
not even to my brother.
Sorry I'm late.
May I sit down?
Please! This is my brother.
I'm Professor Murai, Geological Institute.
Nice to meet you.
My brother thinks you're my boyfriend.
Oi, shut up!
My pleasure.
You look like you're on duty.
I'm going to the mountain again.
To investigate the meteorite?
Did you find anything?
We've discovered it has a strange attraction.
A kind of magnetism or gravity.
Just right for 'Myths Of The 20th Century'.
Blue Mountain.
More interesting than the girl from Jupiter.
"The prophet from Jupiter appeared
yesterday on the crater of Mount Aso..."
"...warning sightseers to stay away."
Everyone, please listen to me.
Leave the volcano immediately. You are not aware
of the danger your are in. Please leave.
Is it going to erupt?
I'm not talking about eruption.
Inside the crater, Rodan is reviving.
I'm scared. Let's go home.
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.
I'm here with you.
You've lost it now.
I gave it to you. I don't want you to lose it.
I can't go down there.
I'll get it for you! 700 Yen!
No, 500 Yen.
All right, how about 200?
It's a deal.
Good.
Stop! Come back here!
Shut up, crackpot! You'll ruin my business.
Come back here!
Help me!
Help me!
Nobody knows we're here?
No. I've reserved a quiet hotel.
Good. Where is the princess?
No, I mean the prophet.
She's been missing since Rodan revived.
But she'll be back.
Are the police looking for her?
They're too busy to bother with her.
"Police have evacuated the area around Mount Aso."
"All climbers and sightseers must stay away."
"Police are also warning that the
meteorite in Kasumizawa might explode."
"Only the research party are allowed on the mountain."
"The public must stay away."
I'm going.
Wait a minute.
Professor, the light is getting brighter.
How strange. There is no magnetism today.
We shouldn't ignore the signs.
We should get out of here.
This is our only opportunity.
Aren't you interested in extra-terrestrial objects?
Of course. But my interest is losing out to my fear.
Professor, it seems to be growing.
Meteorites don't inflate like a balloon.
Let's investigate.
Anything to say before you leave?
We thank you all. We're going back to Infant Island.
If we call you again, will you come?
With pleasure.
But, we wish you'd receive us without a fanfare.
What do you think about Rodan?
Can you tell us where he is?
Our telepathic powers can't prophesy.
But Rodan will appear again soon.
Everybody, goodbye.
This ship must not sail.
It must not sail.
The girl from Jupiter!
Captain, the prophet is on board.
What? I didn't give authorisation.
She says not to sail.
I give the orders. Get rid of her.
Why can't you understand?
This ship must not sail.
Come with me.
Who are you?
A friend.
Excuse me, let me through.
Get off the ship.
Wait, I'll take her with me.
Naoko, wait!
Chief, I've found it!
She's the princess.
What?
How did you get it?
A man was trying to sell it.
Where did you get this?
I didn't steal it. I'm an honest fisherman.
I just want to know how you go it?
I swapped it for my cap, jumper and trousers.
Where?
At sea, that's the truth.
At sea?
On my way back from fishing,
I found a girl adrift.
I only wanted to help her, that's the honest truth.
Didn't you suspect her?
I meant to take her to the police as soon as we
got into harbour, but she was already gone by then.
Which is the one with the bracelet?
That's my cap!
She's the one I met at sea. That one too.
You'll stay here. Take him.
I didn't steal it.
We just need a statement.
Chief, What do you think?
Well, she was in the plane that exploded in mid-air.
How could she survive?
You don't believe it?
Children don't either. What about you?
I don't know. I've asked a lot of people, no one believe it.
But the UFO society's chairman said something interesting.
She was saved because she fell
in the gap between the dimensions.
You may not be aware of it, but there's
a world of dimensions different from ours.
The big explosion created a gap between the two worlds.
She fell into the gap and survived.
I'm from Toyo TV. Is the usual room available?
Sorry, miss. Maybe the one across the corridor?
Room 384? All right.
Are you reporting on vagrants this time?
That's her.
Isn't it?
Not sure. It looks like her.
- Let's do it.
- Wait.
She saw me, but didn't react. Maybe it's not her.
Can I speak to the editor?
It's Naoko.
I'm here with the Jupiter girl.
Yes, we're in the hotel.
That's OK. Can you do me a favour?
Will you bring her some clothes? OK. Bye.
You should relax tonight.
There's someone in the room.
There's no one. We're here alone.
Good evening.
Weren't you aboard the ship?
What's wrong?
We understood what she meant.
What was that?
Don't go aboard that ship.
Please tell me, why not?
What's wrong with that ship?
It's too late.
Professor, that must be a monster.
It's grown another 0.8m since the other day.
How odd. Meteorites down grow.
But this one does. How is the magnetism?
No reaction at all. It's dead.
We should leave. It's getting too big.
Hey! It's starting again.
It fits you nicely.
Where are you going?
My duty is to warn people about
the danger the Earth is in.
Wait! You can tell everyone in
Japan without leaving this room.
Hello. Oh no, don't send him up. I'll come down.
Wait a minute. Stay here.
What do you want brother?
Don't pretend. I know you've got the princess.
Princess? What you're talking about.
Princess.
It's been a long time.
I am from Jupiter.
Nonsense. You're the Princess of Selgina.
I've never heard of her.
First of all, you must leave here at once.
Don't listen to her. Why don't we kill her?
Wait!
We're not in Selgina anymore.
If she's forgotten, I'll remind her.
See this dagger?
I killed your father with it.
Brother, give me back the key. Don't do that!
How many times do I have to tell you?
That girl is the princess.
I know she's with you. Give me the key!
Stop it, or I'll call the police!
Stupid! I am the police.
I could have you arrested.
No. What will you do to the princess?
Protect her of course.
Then send her back when she comes to her senses.
Alright. Come on up.
Princess, what did you do with the bracelet?
Bracelet?
Yes.
You wore the royal bracelet on your right arm.
Yes! On your right arm, remember?
I am from Jupiter. And yet...
And yet?
What?
I may have worn a bracelet.
Where is it now?
Those things are worthless.
Why can't humans realise this?
Where is the bracelet?
I gave it to a poor fisherman.
What's happened? Turn on the light!
Watch out! The killers!
Naoko! Hit the alarm!
Naoko, turn on the light.
Little fairies! Thank you.
Princess!
'The Symptoms Of Chronic
Amnesia And Delusions'?
What's she doing?
You can read in the dark?
I am from Jupiter.
Let's go. It's too dangerous in town.
Where to?
I've asked a doctor to examine her.
Come on, quick.
It's Godzilla!
Where are we going, brother?
Doctor Tsukamoto's laboratory.
A laboratory?
He's an expert in psychology.
He often helps the police.
Fifteen.
Twenty.
Good.
Doctor, can she be cured?
Cured?
There's nothing wrong with her.
She's perfectly normal.
Doctor, then why does she
say she's from Jupiter?
Is she really an alien?
I doubt it. I'll make her tell us what she is.
I have a new treatment,
a kind of sleeping drug.
Look.
Why can't you understand?
The Earth will perish if we don't act.
King Ghidorah will turn it into a dead star.
King Ghidorah?
One hundred years ago, a monster
destroyed Jupiter's culture and science.
Jupiter had once progressed far ahead of Earth.
But, because of the space monster
King Ghidorah, it is a dead planet.
Will King Ghidorah come to Earth?
Yes. He already has.
The Earth is coming to an end.
You don't believe me?
I can see it in your eyes.
I feel as if we are the ones being examined.
Doctor, you must do something.
Right, lie down. Go to sleep.
"Attention! Godzilla and Rodan are
moving from Hakone to Mount Fuji."
"Get ready to evacuate at once."
Hey, get up!
Professor, look!
Follow me.
Professor! Quick! Quick!
Look! It's taking shape!
"Attention! The monster discovered last night
has been identified as King Ghidorah."
"This is an emergency! All citizens
must leave the area!"
Gentlemen, Professor Murai has told us how
the space monster King Ghidorah appeared.
We had Godzilla and Rodan.
And now we have, King Ghidorah!
"How will the government deal with this crisis?
The people want to know!"
"I call upon the Defence Minister..."
...to give us a responsible answer.
General Wado.
All National Guard units have been put on the alert.
They'll be watching the movements
of Godzilla and Rodan.
As for King Ghidorah... we're in contact
with the international allied forces.
We're doing our best...
"...to destroy this monster as soon as possible."
We don't want excuses.
We want to know how you'll destroy them!
General Wando.
This is not just our country's problem.
The entire world is watching us.
Do we have the courage to use atomic
weapons against Godzilla and Rodan?
I don't have to explain any more.
We can only do our best
and prepare for death.
"FUJI NATURAL SCIENCE GARDEN"
Gentlemen, I've taken the liberty of
of bringing some people here.
As the general said, we need help.
Will you listen to them?
By all means.
Oh, it's that girl!
This is Miss Naoko Shindo from Toyo TV.
And these are the fairies from Infant Island.
I thought you'd returned to the island?
No. We're with the prophet now.
The prophet?
Ah, the girl from Jupiter.
Where is she now?
Dr. Tsukamoto's laboratory at Mt. Fuji.
Let's go and find her.
As you know, Mothra and Godzilla fought once.
It may sound primitive and unscientific, but through
the fairies, we could ask Mothra to help.
Would you ask her, girls?
What is it?
We're afraid not even Mothra can
beat King Ghidorah.
You mean Mothra can't defend
Infant Island against King Ghidorah?
No, that's the problem. But...
But? But what?
There is a way.
How? Tell us.
For Godzilla, Rodan and
Mothra to co-operate.
If they unite, they may be able
to overcome King Ghidorah.
But, who'll persuade Godzilla
and Rodan to co-operate?
Mothra might. We'll ask her to.
But, if Godzilla and Rodan refuse,
it will be the end.
We don't have much time! Call
Mothra immediately, we beg you!
Please, call her now!
Doctor, is she in a coma?
Draw the curtains.
All of you, get ready to evacuate.
Now, maybe we'll find out who she really is.
You're sleeping, but your brain is awake.
Tell us who you are.
I come from Jupiter.
Is that so?
But, people from Jupiter
don't live on the Earth.
How did you get here?
I'm one of the people who escaped Jupiter
on the last day of the planet.
When was that?
Five thousand years ago.
Five thousand years ago?
How could you live so long?
Of course I couldn't.
When our ancestors reached the Earth,
they integrated with Earth people.
Our excellent talents degenerated and
we inherited only some of their instincts.
What instincts?
To foresee the future.
Doctor!
Do you believe she is the princess?
Of course she's the princess.
Let's try shock treatment.
Shock treatment?
"Godzilla and Rodan are approaching!
Evacuate this area immediately!"
Let's get her. Know we know where she is.
Doctor, what shall we do?
We can't stop the process now.
It's Godzilla!
Increase the voltage to 500.
No more, or she'll die.
Now what?
We don't need to dirty our hands to kill her.
3,000 volts?
She won't survive.
Let's check it again.
Go away! Godzilla is coming!
- It's OK.
- Good. Let's start.
Are you sure it's at 500?
Yes.
- The power's gone off.
- Let me check it.
Doctor! The assassins!
We're in time.
Stay here.
Go to the front door!
Doctor! It's alright now!
Anyone here?
Oi, wait!
Brother!
Stupid! What are you doing here?
Mothra is coming!
What?
Don't just stand there. Help us!
Doctor! Where are your staff?
They're right behind us.
- You said Mothra was coming?
- Yes.
- Why?
- To fight King Ghidorah.
Leave this place quickly before it
become a land of death!
What did you find out?
She really must be from Jupiter.
Stop the car! Mothra! Mothra is here!
Get out of the car.
Quickly, quickly! Let's go up.
Take this.
Mothra is talking to them.
What are they saying to each other?
What do I know? I don't speak
monster language.
What is she saying?
She is trying to persuade them.
But they don't agree.
She says, "Let's stop fighting each
other and unite against King Ghidorah."
Do Godzilla and Rodan agree?
No. Godzilla and Rodan say it's none of
their business. They don't care.
Damn them.
Godzilla says he has no reason to help humans.
Humans always make trouble.
Rodan says he agrees.
Get out of the way!
Fool! Selfish dog!
Ghidorah!
Mothra is saying "Don't
fight anymore. It's no use."
But Godzilla and Rodan
both want an apology.
But, Mothra is still trying.
Damn them! I thought only humans
could be so stubborn!
Hey, see if the trail is clear.
What is it?
The road is blocked.
There's only one way left.
Follow us!
Haven't they agreed yet?
They're still talking.
We should move up higher.
Come on, let's keep moving!
Mothra is telling them that the Earth
doesn't just belong to humans.
It's theirs too, so they should defend it.
They're almost convinced.
No, they're not.
What will happen now?
Mothra is going to fight alone.
That's impossible!
Godzilla, Rodan! Go!
Fight with Mothra!
Mothra! Good luck!
Godzilla and Rodan are going to fight!
Hey! The princess has disappeared!
Look that way!
I'm going this way.
Go back! The fire has cut the path!
O God, creator of the universe!
Save this planet from the evil monster.
Save it from becoming a dead star.
Princess!
Princess! Get down!
Malness! You traitor!
You've recovered your memory?
Who are you?
I'm a Japanese police officer.
I'm your bodyguard.
I'm alright.
What's that?
My brothers raincoat!
Brother!
Hey, Shindo!
Hey!
Go to the hut on the pass and bring a rope!
Good.
Doctor! Doctor, doctor.
What's happening? What shall we do?
It's the end of our village.
Look! A landslide!
Anything to say?
I wonder... did I really say
I was from Jupiter?
Yes, but you had your wits
about you all the time.
And your predictions were right.
No human could have done that.
But, how did I recover my memory?
You had a real shock.
You were shot here. It worked.
Could I ever have these powers again?
Well, I couldn't say.
It's still beyond my ability.
Thank you, Shindo.
You saved my life three times.
Three times?
At the hotel.
At the laboratory.
And when I got shot.
You remember what happened at
the hotel and laboratory?
I don't remember anything else.
Only that you saved me.
I don't know why.
I won't ever forget what you did.
Princess. I wish you a long and happy life.
Thank you so much.
Goodbye everyone! We're going
back to Infant Island.
Goodbye! Goodbye!
