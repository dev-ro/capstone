Shut Up!
Hands up! Robbery!
Give me the money, hurry up!
What's that?
It's Yen, Sir
I don't want Chinese money
It's not Chinese money, it's Japanese.
The exchange rate is very good
Shut up! I need Euro! French Euro!
I still had some a moment ago.
Those Japs took them all
Did they rob you?
No, they exchanged their Yen
Damn it!
Where can I change your Yen?
Can you help me change it?
I only have British Pounds and Canadian Dollars
What the hell is this place?
Exchange bureau, Sir
I thought it was a bank
No problem, there's one at the corner
Is it a small savings bank?
Yes, a rather famous one, BFC
Everybody hands up! Robbery!
He went that way!
Excuse me, sir
Sorry sir!
How are you!
I am Quentin, I'm from Montargis
Are you eating?
No, I'm shitting
You're kidding, right?
Is it little cracker?
What do you want?
I'm just asking. I'm sure this is little cracker
Do you always eat with the same side of your jaw?
Do you want to keep bugging me?
I ask because your teeth on the left are probably rotten
So you always eat with your right
I knew a guy once, called Mish
or Mishra, I forget, whatever
Can you shut up? I want to sit on my own
Oh, please go on eating, it won't disturb me
That guy Mish, Mishra or Misha, I don't know
He's the same as you, the left cheek always swollen
I laughed and said to him,
'You look like an ass,
but only one side of an ass', ha ha
-Go on, do you want me to crack your head?
- Alright!
'Only one side of an ass', I called him
He eats just like you with the noise, a real pig
I said to him, 'One side of an ass, you eat like a pig'
It's him again, real asshole!
I don't understand
We were just talking, and suddenly he jumped at me
Can't lock him up here
I know, but we don't have enough single cells
Every time when he was locked up with someone else
Perhaps there's a way to solve this
Concentrate
What do you see here?
A stain?
Yes, correct
But, what does this stain remind you of?
Keep concentrating
A dye house?
Quentin, it's about the shape of the stain,
Not the way to remove it
Oh, I'm sorry!
Just a little fly, I didn't catch it
So? That stain?
There is another one on your tie
No, we're talking about that one!
This one is ok
The one disturbing me is the stain on your tie
Don't move...
Oh! Stupid asshole! My God!
I got it
I said it's only a stain
Sorry, I cannot take him
Oh no, you can't say that
I examined him carefully, and he's not mad
His mental condition is completely coherent and under control
Go ahead then, doctor
Ok
To be honest, he is unbelievably stupid
Doctor, you must get him out of here.
I'm certain he belongs at an asylum
My place is for the mad, not for idiots
You can consider building one for idiots, but
Just imagine its scale
So?
Do anything exciting today?
Nothing special, I did some shopping
He didn't say a word after being arrested, not a single word
I don't know his details
You see, I can do this too
I can also shut up for several hours,
staring at the wall across
We've found the body
Go on looking at the wall, just like
a movie. I'll show you the scene
A forest, middle of the night
A plastic bag buried underneath,
with a woman decomposing inside
A beautiful woman shot by Vogel
because she slept with you
Do you like it?
Let's go on, I'll show you another scene
A cash delivery van hit by a rocket
Carnage on the road
A man comes from nowhere to take the money from the robbers
This one's good too, right?
Do you like any of these?
Now we change to another scene
Now we are in Vogel's house
You have worked for him long enough
Needless to say how beautiful and luxurious the place is
The only ugly part of the decoration, is Vogel
He's furious, because you've made him uncomfortable
That cash box...
Ruby, it's Vogel I'm after, not you
Give me Vogel and the money
and I'll get you out of here in no time
I'll let you continue looking at the wall. I believe you will help
The scene with the plastic bag in the forest...
If this makes you feel bad, call me
How do you do?
I am Quentin, I'm from Montargis
None of my business
You don't want to talk
You get like that when you
stay too long in prison
How long have you been here?
I knew an African. He came from Antilles
If he comes from Antilles, he is an Antillean, idiot!
Not African!
No, he is African, named Joseph
Some Antilleans are also named Joseph
I don't know
Perhaps
You see, now you want to talk
What's your name?
Joseph
Then you are African
No, I am Antillean, idiot!
Just like that Joseph, he is African
Martinian, and Antillean
Are you kidding me?
Oh no, on the contrary, I like Africans
It won't help for me to worry
He stares at the wall
You know that
Ruby, he is an old hand
That method can do nothing to him
Oh no!
It's him again!
What's happening?
Quentin
The guy looking for trouble.
He's real stupid, always getting into fights
Look at this idiot
He made 5 prisoners mad in 2 weeks
How are you?
I am Quentin, I'm from Montargis
What are you looking at?
Can I have a look?
I don't see anything
Ah, yes!
The spider over there?
I tried to communicate with it once.
To be honest, I failed
It was very reluctant
I give it orders, it wouldn't listen
Even simple orders
Sit, lie, go back, no action
It just stays there, stares at me
Looks like it does not understand a bit
It's difficult to believe. Perhaps
I have come across the least talented
Just like that for one whole month...
I didn't wait
If you like, we can try this one as well
But I'm afraid you will be disappointed too
Tell you one thing, I really like your hair
and your eyes like that of a horse
Don't think I'm kidding, I mean it
You have a pair of eyes like a colt
Very Good!
I wanted to be a jockey when I was small
But I grew up too big for a jockey
I had been a stable boy
The horses there have big and
beautiful eyes, just like yours
I love the stable, it smells good there
The horses there stare with their large eyes
showing a little sadness
You see, I'm very happy to stay with you here
Just like I was in the stable
This is the horse gets thirsty
You see, if we bring them out for a round...
He will crack, I'm sure
He stays in the cell, keeps silent
has no contact with anybody
Give me the order, I'll get rid of him
How about my money?
I know Ruby, he'll get out very soon
I will wait for him at the exit
How are you, Quentin?
Very good, Mr. Warden
Tell me, do you get on well with your new friend?
Very well
He's real nice, interested in everything
He doesn't talk much
No
But he listens
I can talk about anything with him
He never argues or fights with me
I can talk at my own pleasure. He just listens
That's my buddy
Some bread?
Are you asleep?
I had a dream, I have to tell you
In the dream we two have gone out
and started a small tavern together
You know, just like those small taverns near Paris
In Montargis, for example
We called it 'Home of Two Friends',
I serve the beer, coffee or small drinks
You talk to the customers behind the till
Usually, I never have such a clear dream
it seemed like I was there
'Home of Two Friends'
What have you done?
What have you done? Really so stupid!
What have you done?
Help! Open the door!
Open the door! Come on!
Open up!
You must eat something, Quentin
Do you hear? You cannot go on like this
Is he coming back?
No, he is not coming back
This is your own room.
Now I won't let other people live here
You have to eat something, ok?
Where is he?
In a place where we can treat him well
He's not your buddy
Ruby will not be anyone's buddy
Fuck you!
It ain't easy to get a hold of you
You see?
I did it just like you
I started to understand when I was sent out of the prison
That's just for the escape. It's really beautifully done
I have never felt so good myself
For the sake of others, you shouldn't do that again
We haven't known each other very long
But I have never had a real partner
You won't do that again, will you?
You should not leave me on my own
I won't leave you either.
I'll be by your side all the time
What are you doing on the bed?
Don't you see that you're sitting on somebody?
Oh, I'm sorry
Well... he's gone
Oh God, I killed him
What happened?
He sat on the old man
He's small. I didn't see him. I killed him.
No, he's not quite dead. You didn't kill anybody
Take off the apparatus
I'll tell you how I found you
But you cannot sit on him
Oh, he doesn't care
I even know your name is Ruby, from Pido
But he's not completely dead
Get up, then!
Ruby of Pido and Quentin of
Montargis don't mean bad, do they?
What are you doing here?
Is anyone here bothering you?
I'll go, I'll go
If this bed is vacant, can you please keep it for me?
Eat some meat... it'll be good for your body.
You need your energy
Eat the meat, I tell you
Ah, Doctor, how are you?
Very interesting, I thought of you yesterday
-Oh yeah?
-Yes
I got the ketchup on my arm
made quite a stain
I was thinking, too bad you weren't there
How are you, Ruby?
Silent as usual?
If you continue to keep silent
I can no longer help you
He's not bad, where do you want to take him?
Listen to me, Ruby, a man who wants
to kill himself and refuses to speak,
We do not keep him at the hospital
We transfer him to a mental hospital
I don't talk either. I only ever speak to you
You should send me there too
Very good, Quentin. Please let me work
Me too, I intend to cut my wrist to die
Tell me just one word, just one, and I'll deal...
And I'll deal with this internally to avoid
any possible consequence, Ruby
Good, I'll take care of you
If you don't bring us both with you,
I will bang my head on that wall
Stop saying stupid things, Quentin
It looks not too serious. No damage to the brain
I don't want to be nasty,
but his brain has nothing to be damaged
What can we do any further...
to stop him from entering the Guiness book?
He's waking
Are you alright, Quentin?
I have a headache
This is normal, especially
when we bang our head on the wall
I cannot organize my own thoughts
The mind gets confused for a while, no big deal
My buddy, where is he?
Where's my buddy?
I've tied you up
because I don't know if you really want to kill yourself
or just fake it to prepare for your escape plan
We'll release you in a few days
During this period, we will inject
you with a medicine called Aldol
This is a very painful treatment, but after this
you won't be able to escape again
5 mg. of Aldol
100,000
I'll give 100,000 euro if you help me get out of here
You are not the first patient to give such a proposal
I'm the first who has 20 million
You can have a look at my files.
I may not be the craziest of them,
but I am the richest
I'm listening
He asked me to help him get out
I was just going to report him
Then he says if I want to earn a
little bit more, I can contact you
How much?
100,000 euro
I have to pay 100,000 euro to get him out?
Have you all heard him?
He says, let me pay this money to get him out
I am to give him 2 injections everyday
to make him into a 'vegetable'
If you prefer that way, bring me back to my car
He really makes me mad! Stole 20 million
from me, then wants 100,000 more!
He'll give me an answer tomorrow
I don't like this guy, he gives me the creeps
Is he your friend?
Can't say he is
Then why does he agree to pay
100,000 euro to get you out?
Because he and I have a personal agreement
This agreement is very important for him.
He will pay you, I guarantee it
Have you seen my friend Ruby?
Ruby - from Pidu
Tall guy, big, brown hair, big eyes like a horse
No, haven't seen him
He is around, he went crazy at the same time as me
Damn it!
If he comes...?
Ruby
Damn it
Ruby!
Damn it!
Ruby!
Damn it!
What's the matter with you,
shouting 'Damn it' so loudly?
Damn it!
Damn it!
Ruby!
He's agreed
It is an ambulance, coming on Wednesday
I send you in
I need to get some regular clothes
It's prepared
Now we take a walk outside
You must pretend to be an idiot,
looking like you took the treatment
Ruby!
Ruby!
Where have you been? I've been looking for you for two days
Something's wrong. Is he not feeling right?
He's in intensive treatment. Don't disturb him
What's that? 'Intensive treatment"
What else are you going to do?
Look at him. He can't even walk
He's fine. Please go away.
Else I have to return him to his room
They are making him into a 'vegetable'
I was a psychiatrist. I don't know how I got in here
I'm not complaining. I'm ok here,
not too much responsibility
He's not that unlucky. You can imagine
'vegetables' are very unlucky; like we've seen
spinach or brussel sprouts
We don't know what will happen tomorrow
I don't understand anything you're saying
It's simple
Ah, how are you, Doctor?
How are you, Nosberg
He does not look too good.
Did you do a lobotomy?
You have to find another partner, Quentin
If you think of someone, you can call them
They can visit, you know
Do you have family?
You have friends, don't you?
I had one, but you made him a 'vegetable'
I'm trying to help you, Quentin
I don't think you know the true face of Ruby
He's a killer
He is as cold as this rock
We will open a small tavern
called 'Home of Two Friends'
Why did you get into jail, Quentin?
I robbed
It's not worthwhile
That got me into jail
Have you worked?
No... Yes, only once
What did you do?
Building houses
You built houses and you have no friends?
When I want to see someone, I call
Don't get bored on your own, ok?
Henry!
Haven't you had enough, Martineau?
Just this last one, and I'll go
Hello?
Who?
Hang on
It's for you
For me?
Hello!
Martineau, it's me, Quentin
Quentin from Montargis
Are you still in prison?
No, I have become a madman now
You should try to be positive
Just like this world, there is good and bad
Tell me, Martineau!
After I get out, I want to open
a small tavern with a friend
And I thought of you
-Me?
-Yeah
As the business needs a partner, I'll tell my friend
Martineau knows a lot about taverns
Well, yes...
Oh, that's my glass
Wait, I'm talking about very important things
Are you serious?
Of course!
But you cannot drink too much!
This is not to open a brothel
Really incredible
Tell me Martineau
Are you still working at the construction site?
We'll walk through the garden as before
Then we'll get into the ambulance in the car park
He'll be waiting
Eh?
The guy who'll pay you must have prepared 
a surprising welcome ceremony
That has nothing to do with me
Yes, he'll be waiting for you too
Me?
To get back the 100,000 euro, then kill you
Are you kidding?
After you...
I'm not going. The money will be
returned to him. I knew this was bullshit
If I were you, I would watch out for his reaction
When we get out, you give me a hand
You can escape from here, no problem
I'm only responsible for getting you out,
not having someone murdered!
Why does he follow us so closely?
What the hell is this?
We are going to escape, brother!
We are escaping!
God damn it!
What a pity! Idiot!
You look pretty well, not a bit like a 'vegetable'
This is the asylum, we have two patients on the run
Oh, shit!
What happened?
Wait!
They have returned
Holy shit! That guy got drunk again
What?
That crane driver is a friend
I told him, if he got us out
I would open a tavern with him
Yes, still the asylum
The two patients have gone again
Yes, they have returned and escaped again
Martineau!
Where are you going? Martineau! Martineau!
This is too ridiculous!
What should we do?
You see, he is not insane, just pretending.
Look at the result
I've told you. From the treatment
he received, he is not capable of running
I think you better review your treatment
This is not an escape
What else can it be?
It looks like Quentin was holding him under duress
and went up the cradle with him
Quentin kidnapped Ruby?
Ruby is not capable of acting on his own, I've told you
According to your reasoning,
the most stupid person in the asylum
successfully kidnapped the most dangerous member
Is that right?
I've been a psychiatrist for 20 years.
I have sufficient experience
He can jump from mid-air.
Does this surprise you?
It does not surprise me but has
destroyed my car
Sorry, we will solve your problem a little bit later
And, I have lost a nurse
What?
The guy who watches Ruby
also disappeared
If I understand right, we have to find a nurse
A crane driver, an idiot and a murderer
Now we have work to do
Are you feeling alright?
Listen, Montargis!
No, Quentin
Montargis is my place of birth
Stop the bullshit!
I fully understand who you are
You work for the police
You help me get out so I can lead you to the money,
as a condition of the deal
Only you have overdone it
Nobody falls for this
I am not a fool
I know you are much smarter than I am
Me?
Yes
Much smarter!
What is it?
Nothing, it's just...
This is the first time someone says I'm smart
I know this time I have done well
I fully deserve it, it is not easy
Shut up!
I told Martineau not to drink
But we can't be perfect
Nevertheless, we are free.
All because of me
It makes me really happy that you think I'm smart
We run from the hospital,
penniless and the police chasing after us
And you think you are smart?
No, it's you who think I'm smart
You've just told me
What's happening here?
I won't say anything.
I won't call the police. I swear
What do you sell here?
Little toys, little toys for mischief
We need clothes and money!
For clothes, I only have these
Do you have anything larger?
You want to go on a parade, idiot?
Is this it?
I just opened, business is bad
Don't report to the police
No! I swear!
Paris Police 5th district.......
Who are you calling?
My wife
Is your wife named 'police 5th district'?
Get in!
I took these from the shop
for my old man in Ladasse
Me too, I'm from Ladasse
Sounds almost the same, doesn't it?
A cow
A cow farting
Go away, Montargis!
Quentin
Yes?
So?
So, What?
Catch him?
No
Why not? Did they run out?
Sorry
Hello
What's going on? Where are you now?
In the embrace of mother nature, Vogel
What about my men?
I left them on the pavement in disorder
I think we have settled through the nurse
For me, you have shown your nature by killing Sandra.
What else you'll do, I can't imagine
You have stolen my money. You will end up like her
Don't be mistaken, Vogel, You're
not the hunter and I'm not the prey
I will find you, you will pay
You poor guy, just you alone?! Police are looking for you
You have no chance!
We got him in the car but
the other one attacked from behind
A big guy, very powerful
Are you making up this story?
Ruby is a lone wolf. He does not work with anybody
But they left together
And in my BMW?
That car has gps. We'll find it
They are in the country
What?
When I called him, they were in the fields
With many cows at their side
We found the driver in a tavern by the asylum
He is totally drunk
Did he say anything?
Nothing. He is out of his mind
This is his confession
Martineau
I have been a crane driver for 25 years. I have never...
Shut up!
Now I can be sure
Quentin is the leader of this escape
Leader?
Quentin is the leader of this operation. Really strange
They have robbed a little toy shop
Took 15 euros and a pair of sound simulation toys
From here we go our own way
What? Our own way?
Thank you for helping me, bye, bon voyage
But we cannot leave like this. Aren't we partners?
No, we are not partners
I never work with anyone, especially not a cop
What cop?
Are you having fun?
Yes, of course, yes
Then, say, 'Yes, I work for Officer
Vernet of the Police Department'
Yes, I'm here to get back the 20 million euro
Yes, I work for Officer Vernet
Yes, I'm here to get back the 20 million euro
Ok, isn't it getting better now?
Good, now we are partners
Are you making a fool of me?
No, why do you say that?
Vernet told you
If you are in control, report to the police
If I am in control, then I should report to the police
Correct
Good
Where should I call?
Call the police department idiot... are you pretending?
No, no, what is the number?
Don't you know the number of the police?
No, why should I know?
You just confessed that you work for them
Right, you said that would make you happy
What?
I don't understand...
Don't move!
It's a dislocated shoulder. I had one before
I know how to fix it. Sit down quickly
Go away!
It'll be difficult to cure it
if you don't look after it now, come on
I know it hurts
Hold on
Don't be afraid. It will be fine soon
Ok
It's back
So?
Who are you, really?
I am Quentin
Quentin from Montargis
You don't have to worry about anything with me
You'll see
Are you better?
It's hurts from falls, a bit of a nag
But it's nothing to worry about
Are you a doctor?
No, why do you ask?
I wanna be a doctor
Not in Paris, but a countryside,
where everyone knows each other
In Montargis, for example
It will be free for the poor
Patients come to my clinic:
It's appendicitis
How much should I pay, doctor?
"No Pay, it's free"
I'll find a way to make it happen
Shut up!
ok, ok
It's a nice car
I have stolen this type before,
it's very good
But I got arrested quickly
By some satellite navigation system
That locates the car
Ok, ok, I'll stop
Why didn't you say so earlier? Fool!
You scare me when you shout!
I'm stupid for not thinking of it
No, you are not stupid... like me
You're just muddled for a while
They're going through Nantel
They're heading to Robnil
Stop there
They're following us.
We should abandon this car,
leave in our hospital pyjamas,
and make a clean getaway
If you like, I can come back
with a car and some clothes
I don't like it
Why?
Since I already had a plan for it
But I missed the ambulance and the uniform.
You made it useless
And because of you, I broke my shoulder and hipbone
The only success we've had is stealing a car
which can be traced
See, what a moronism
If you take that thing out again...
Ok
I'm sorry about your escape plan
I thought I did a good job
We will be caught
If we wear clothes like this
They are coming
We must find another car and clothes
Leave the key in the car,
and keep the door open
Let a thief steal the car?
Yes
Is that you, dear
No
Don't be afraid, we won't hurt you.
We only want some clothes
Who are you? How did you get in?
Is this yours?
That's impossible, stand up
What's your size, sprat guy?
Leave it, just give us your car keys
Ah, Julian
I got it, he was a jockey
It's Julian LeFebvre
Careful,
I just bought it
We wouldn't dare damage it
I respect people of your kind
I once worked in stable, I was a stable boy
-Were you?
-Yes
I'm Quentin come from Montargis
You'd better tell him about me too
Oh, sorry
He's Ruby, from Bido
Oh, my god
Feo Jozo?
It's no coincidence, God gave you this
Do you see it's eyes?
Like yours
Who are you talking to, my dear?
Drive!
He's so kind
Look, they stole the BMW, right in front of us
Very good
How can you say very good
They haven't even reached the age limit
Lower your head
Follow that car
We'll catch them, then what should we do
This is good
Stop them, leave the other,
and bring Ruby back
I stole bikes at their age
We're juveniles,
we don't have to talk to cops
We're not cops,
and we don't have to talk to juveniles
Freeze
Start moving
See, if I compare the Benz and BMW
No
Benz is softer and BMW have more power
I said no!
Hello?
Hello?
I'm coming, Vogel,
No need for the other car,
this one is good
A BMW has more power
Fuck you, you don't scare me
Sandra is waiting for you.
You'll lay down shoulder to shoulder, I swear
Four guys with guns
We were just thinking, it's no problem
they're only cops
They are not cops
And two men come out, take all of them down
And what?
Two muscle men. Powerful
They get those four guys down,
then drive their car away
I didn't call you, because we had a problem
It's not serious
They drove the Benz away,
and we got the BMW
Are you going to waste more time changing cars?!
No
We can catch them in five minutes
Don't worry, nothing will happen
Where did they go?
Lalemon
That's my home
What should we do?
Come back right now!
We must get there before them
What are they doing?
They want to take a shortcut
Hello?
The shortcut you're taking has a problem.
There is construction at Charles De Gaulle
They play tricks with us
They will arrive before us
Who are you calling?
This is the police number, please wait
This is the police number, please wait
We will get him out tooth and nail
You ask him to go back?
Can you stop them?
Police!
Maybe not for us
Turn!
Hey, look at that
Oh, shit
They're disturbed
By who?
They're bewildered
Have you seen those two idiots?
That's us, idiot
Oh, shit, I didn't think it would be like this
Any cigarettes?
I don't smoke
Can you lend me some to buy cigarettes, beauty?
No cash, no problem,
credit card is fine
Give it up
Don't kid him, he will be angry.
I know him, he angers quickly
No joke?
Oh, I'm scared
What will happen if he gets angry?
You'll be hit, and your ass will kiss the dirt
I wanna see that
See?
I told you
Shit then...
You should be kind
Sit down
So, what's happened to you?
Two gays
We asked them for cigarettes
They beat us and took our clothes
Is this them?
Yes
I want my clothes back
No, not tonight
I can't, I told you,
I have overtime work
Don't think too much,
I have no date, I have work
I'll call you later, bye
Hello, it's Cristina
I'm free now, I'll be there soon.
See you later
Oh, shit!
Stupid!
Oh, thanks
He's the third idiot prick, thank you
If you don't want to be robbed,
you should stay at home
It's Ruby, let me speak to Vogel
Stay against the wall, and you'll be ok
Hello, Vogel,
I won't delay, I'll be there at once
Oh, shit
They're closing the block off to search
We need to separate!
Why?
They look for two people,
We're too obvious if we stay together
We separate from here.
Good luck
What can I do?
It's not my problem
Maybe I'll go back to my family in the countryside
That's great
But they're all dead
Fuck you
No, I'm just thinking about it
It makes no difference,
The old are deaf and crazy
Do you have family?
Don't follow me, I don't want it to get worse
How can it get worse? 
You're my buddy, it can't get worse.
It will be worse with you.
You follow others...
...and make them crazy
I didn't follow anyone
Oh, really? What are you doing now?
Why are you leaving without a car?
You want me to steal one?
That's my specialty!
No
Yes! Don't move. I promise
I'll come back with one
Count to ten
I don't understand,
I already cut the line
-It beeps all the time
-Shut up!
Now, the noise make me nervous
You've caused so much trouble.
Don't follow me again. If you follow,
I promise, I didn't want trouble with the car
You invite trouble wherever you go
Go, if you didn't want me to follow you, I promise
But if you kill theses two cops for escaping
that will be bad
I don't know if you often do this, but
Don't kill them, It's not a good thing
So why were you in prison?
Did you piss everywhere in Montargis, or what?!
You are not a killer, Ruby
You are a good guy, you don't kill others
You will get in heaven before others
Yeah?
Yes, because I have never seen such a simple mind
Good luck, Quentin from Montargis
Hands up, Don't do anything stupid
Where is the other one?
Why did you hit me?
Don't worry, I'll take care of you
Attention, every patrol team
Be on the lookout for a police car
Peugeot 806, white
We're being sought for stealing this car
If we stay in this car,
we'll be caught in five minutes
That sucks, because this one is good
for escaping fires
Watch...
How fun it is
Stop it
Did you see that?
It's first time that a policeman saluted me
Stop now, you idiot!
Don't be angry, I'll steal another
Oh, shit
Hands up!
I didn't do anything bad
It's my car and I lost my keys
Get out of the car
Ok, I'll get out right now
Ok
Put your hands on top of the car
It's me, don't be afraid
What the hell is that?
I've stolen another car
I had some trouble with police,
but they're asleep
You just got out of that police car
And got a second
But they're not the same
Yes, it gets worse
Let's go
I don't want to sit in a police car
Bloody hell!
Ok, ok. Don't be angry, it's bad for your health
Excuse me, sir
Violet St. please
What's this, an Opel?
It reminds me of a German car
but it's making my leg jerk
They steal a police car,
It already disgraces us, but two
and a third
Are they making a collection, or what?
-No, we've got them back
-Ah, good
Listen carefully
Ruby is hurt, and can't move well.
The other's brain is muddled
If they're not found by tomorrow morning
You should prepare for street patrol, understand?
The bullet is out,
you'll be fine
It was a bistro before
I saw it before it closed
Don't you think it's an ideal place?
What do you prefer?
Cashier or waiter?
Ok
Sit straight, against the wall behind you
It won't cost so much money
for this small bar,
How much do you think?
Twenty thousand? Thirty thousand?
Quentin!
Maybe less?
-I mean just as much as to set up the business
-Quentin!
Yes?
I took 20 million dollars from Vogel
How much?
20 million
I've got two things left to do in life:
kill Vogel, and flee with the money
Buying a bistro with you is not in my plans.
Got it?
And you should deliver yourself to the cops
You are not a murderous criminal, at a dead end
I picked up something to eat
I thought you might be hungry
Jam
Oh, shit
It's not jam, it's a laxative
I'll pay to complete your dream
I'm gonna put the money in another account
so you can run your own bistro
I can't take it
Why?
Because my bistro is named "Home of Two Friends"
But how come you take me as your friend?
Aren't you?
Stop eating, or you are gonna shit all over the place
Hide!
What do we do?
She looks like someone
Who?
Anything wrong?
Let her sleep!
We have to wait like this till tomorrow morning?
Shut up!
Anyone here?
Bastard!
I didn't mean to
Bullshit!
Who's there?
Don't worry, you're safe, I'm injured
I'm just hiding here to recover
Ok, ok, you can leave,
but I'm telling you, you're safe here
Hi! I'm Quentin from Montargis
Hold on!
Idiot!
Me?
You've scared her, idiot!
How come? I was just introducing myself
She saw a big chunk of idiot
coming out of nowhere
"Hi! I'm Quentin from Montargis"
She was scared!
Sorry
I always introduce myself that way.
People like it
Nobody is gonna care that you're Quentin, from Montargis!
Don't sit there, bug off!
Who does she look like?
Leave me alone!
I might be a pathetic guy who can
only think about running a bistro
But I know other things, too
She looks like the girl that Vogel killed
You loved her?
If you want, I can go find her
Not necessary, she's gone now
Why did Vogel kill her?
Why did he kill her?
You are being really annoying!
OK, I'll stop
Does it hurt?
You need anything?
Why did he kill her?
How come you are still alive?
I don't know where to go
And it's cold outside
Come, sleep on the bench,
he can sleep in the hall
Oh, no!
You'll scare her!
No, he can sleep here
You're very nice
Come, let's go
Are you asleep?
Are you asleep?
Awake, now!
I didn't mean to wake you up
but this doesn't make me feel so good
What?
That girl
We don't even know her, and we invite her to our place
What if she steals from us?
Steals what? Those two little toys of yours?
It doesn't feel right, I'm telling you
Just like two buddies preparing to start their business
a bistro, for instance
You sink everything into it
Sleep!
I'm telling you, you will remember this in the future
You've had a nightmare
It's ok, don't worry
You scared me!
You wanna talk, or have a minute of your own?
Where are you from?
Albania
You have no ID?
How long have you been here?
Three days
You look exactly like somebody else
Pardon?
No, nothing
Try to sleep
There's nothing wrong with her, I swear
Good night
I don't know why we are so hasty
There are dogs, monitors
It's impossible for anyone to get in
In the garden! Right there!
No! That's Henry!
I'm gonna be alone again, I can feel it
I don't care, I've gotten used to it.
A girl comes, and then, goodbye, pal
You want to annoy me to death or what?
This is better, anyway
Yeah, better this way
She's gonna change your plans.
This is better
Nobody will change my plans.
Not her, not you
Tomorrow, I'll kill Vogel.
Now, I'm going to sleep
It's suicide.
I'd prefer that you leave with her
God damn it, we have five people, fully armed
What does he have?
That's Ruby!
So what?  He's not superman
He doesn't even have a gun
Gun or no gun,
He has his own ways
How is it going?
Great
I guess he won't be coming
I guess he wouldn't be stupid enough to come
Hi, may I talk to Mr. Vogel?
I'm Quentin, from Montargis
I got out with Ruby this morning
I'm listening
Good evening, Mr. Vogel
I know, you are looking for Ruby
I can tell you where he's hiding
What do you want from me?
I know that he took your money
I'd like to have a share of that soup, too
I'll call you tomorrow morning and set up a meeting
Good evening, Mr. Vogel. Good night
Sleep well?
This is appetizing biscuit, tastes great
Where did she go?
She'll be back to get her stuff
What is wrong with you?
Last night, I got an idea
An idea?
When are you going to meet Vogel?
Why?
I thought maybe I could help
Oh, no!
Yeah, I have a plan
What plan?
Don't worry, you won't be disappointed
If you do the silly things you did yesterday again...
No, Don't worry!
I have to worry!
It's because of you I'm injured all over.
Shoulders, hips, bullets in my back...
What's your next plan? Skull fracture?
Don't worry!
Want some?
What's your name?
Katia
What are you going to do now?
I don't know
You can't stay here forever
Sure, especially when it's going to be decorated soon
If the cops catch me, they'll send me back to Albania
I'll be put in jail
It's all the same
I'm going to set out, good luck, Katia!
Take me with you!
-I can't
-He can't
Shut up, you!
I won't give you any trouble, I promise!
I have something to do, it might be very dangerous
I don't care
Take me with you!
I'm Quentin
I wish to speak with Mr. Vogel
Coffee?
So?
Not a clue
I've read a report about hunting in Africa
Do you know what kind of animal
is the most dangerous to the hunters?
Buffalo
If you can't kill him with the first shot,
then it's his turn to kill you
Even with one gasp left, he pursues
All he thinks about is killing you
Patrol around Vogel's house 24 hours a day
that's the most likely place to catch Ruby
Give me a few minutes
Where are you going?
Four
Four by eight...
Four by eight...
Where is he?
He went for a ride and will be back soon
Sit, please
Why didn't you tell us he was going to leave?
I said he would be back soon
Sit, please
You'd better hope he comes back soon
You can live here, they won't ask you anything
You can get a room
Why are you doing this for me?
I've been running all my life
Besides, you look like another woman...
Ok, I've gotta go
-Don't you want to stay a bit longer?
-No...
I wish, but I can't
You'll get through this, I'm sure
Maybe I shouldn't be telling you this,
However, your friend phoned someone last night
Some guy named Vogel
My cellphone
I didn't quite get what he was saying
but he mentioned money
and he said he would call this morning to set up a meeting
Oh, shit! That's what the idiot's plan was!
You piece of shit, trick us here?
Idiot!
Quentin!
Quentin, can you hear me?
Ruby!
Welcome...
This is your plan? To trick them here...
...so I can get into Vogel's house easier?
Yes
Very smart, isn't it?
Yes, very smart
Take it
It's a really smart plan.
Let us improve on it a bit
Phone him
Hello?
We've found him, and we're bringing him back
Very good, see you later
Don't you...
What?
Kill him
Don't kill him, Ruby!
That's not good
Lie down and rest!
Here they are!
They're coming...Ruby is going to Vogel's
Wait here, I'll take care of you when I finish
Let's go
Who is the prey now? Huh?
Who's the hunter?
It's a good day for me,Vogel
Oh, really?
Careful, he's got a gun!
You have five seconds to tell me where the money is
or I'll blow your head off
One
Two
Three
Shit! I killed him?
Vogel, it's Officer Vernet, open the door!
Open the door, and come out!
Quentin!
Quentin!
Can you hear me?
I'm not hurt
The house is surrounded, get out!
We won't be unreasonable
Someone is hurt here! Hurry up!
Quentin, he's injured
No, I'm ok
They're gonna heal you, don't worry
We can't run the bistro
Don't say that!
We'll buy your bistro. It'll be great, you'll see
I'll take care of the money
and you'll be the waiter, saying:
"Welcome to 'House of Two Friends',
this is a wonderful bistro!"
You're just saying that
because I'm going to die
You are not going to die
You'll bring the beers,
the chips, and the sandwiches
Oh, no chips, they take too much time
and smell up the place
No
But you told me that was better
Yeah, we're gonna make croques, hot dogs...
Evidently,
It's all over.
He's not too bad
Hold on, I have been shot once
We killed Vogel
You'd better release us soon
'Cause we have something else to do
Oh, shit!
