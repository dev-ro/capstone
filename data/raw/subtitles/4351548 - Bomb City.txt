IT'S NOW OR NEVER,
MOTHERFUCKERS!
WE END THIS SHIT TONIGHT.
"DESTROY EVERYTHING."
IS THIS THE MESSAGE WE WANT
TO SEND OUR CHILDREN
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME?
"DESTROY... EVERYTHING."
THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IS WHAT THAT
WEAPON-WIELDING GOON WORE
THE NIGHT OF THE ALTERCATION.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE
HE WAS ON
A MISSION TO KILL.
COMBAT BOOTS,
WAR CHAINS...
AND THIS.
"DESTROY EVERYTHING."
HOW'S IT GOING, NEW YORK?
I CHOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU
IN A SQUARE
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE KIND OF
CONDITIONED TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE,
WHEN THEY'RE IN
THE SHAPE OF A SQUARE.
AND ALSO, HERE IN HOLLYWOOD,
THIS IS WHERE WE GIVE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.
VIOLENCE, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
IT SEEMS TO COME DOWN TO.
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO
EVERYONE TODAY ABOUT,
UH... I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO PREACH,
I JUST WANT TO, MORE,
BRING UP SOME QUESTIONS.
AND SINCE I ALWAYS
TEND TO BE
A SCAPEGOAT, I THOUGHT
WE'D TALK ABOUT BLAME.
RIGHT NOW,
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BLAME MUSIC,
THEY WANT TO
BLAME MOVIES,
BUT, UH... YOU KNOW,
WE'VE FORGOTTEN
THAT WE HAVE A DEAD GUY
HANGING FROM A TREE
IN OUR LIVING ROOMS.
UH... UH...
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE
WORSHIPPED ALL OUR LIVES.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT
THE CRUCIFIX AS THE...
THE GREATEST MASS-MARKET
PIECE OF MERCHANDISE
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT
TO BE KIND OF INTERESTING.
WE HAVEN'T REALLY SAT DOWN AND
TALKED ABOUT THAT ON THE NEWS.
UM... ALSO, WONDERED
WHY NOBODY CARES WHEN
AN ADULT COMMITS SOME
SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE
THEY WANT TO HAVE
A REASON WHY.
THAT'S ONLY WHEN
A KID DOES IT.
BUT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY...
BEGUN TO CONFUSE PEOPLE NOW
AND WHY WE'RE IN THIS STATE
OF... UH, CHAOS
AND, UH, PC, NONSENSICAL,
UPTIGHTNESS.
IT'S WHITE TEENAGERS.
THAT'S THE REAL ENIGMA.
WHY ARE THEY MAD?
THEY'RE MIDDLE CLASS,
THEY'RE WHITE,
THEY'RE SPOILED.
IS IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW
AMERICA'S A LIE?
IS IT BECAUSE
WE MAKE THEM FEEL
LIKE THEY'RE NEVER
GOOD ENOUGH, YOU KNOW?
"YOU'RE NEVER GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP,
FOR THE CAR, FOR THE GIRL.
NEVER GOOD ENOUGH TO BE
FAMOUS FOR 15 MINUTES."
AND THEN, ARE WE SURPRISED
WHY THEY'RE MAD
OR WHY THEY END UP DEAD,
YOU KNOW?
WHY THE VIOLENCE?
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW...
YOU MADE THEM, AMERICA.
YOU KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
COME ON, GET YOUR GAME DAY
SPORTS STUFF.
SHIT, YEAH.
HEY, QUIT MESSING AROUND, MAN.
WHY? I DON'T EVEN SEE WHY YOUR
BITCH-ASS NEEDS A HELMET ANYWAY.
JV HAS NO BUSINESS
SUITING UP.
COME ON NOW, RICKY.
HE MIGHT SEE THE FIELD.
WE'LL HAVE THEIR ASS BEAT
BY HALFTIME, YOU KNOW THAT.
MCCORMICK, YOU ACT LIKE IT'S
HARD TO BE A LINEMAN, MAN.
ALL YOU DO IS SIT ON
YOUR FAT ASS AND EAT.
BUDDY, ONLY THING I'M EATING
IS YOUR MOM'S PUSSY.
WHAT... GET...
GET THE FUCK OFF ME!
QUIT FREAKIN' PLAYING
GRAB-ASS, MAN!
IT'S A PLAYOFF GAME!
ACT LIKE IT!
LET IT GO, CODY.
COME ON,
LET'S BRING IT IN, MEN.
OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN,
HALLOWED BY THY NAME.
THY KINGDOM COME,
THY WILL BE DONE,
ON EARTH AS IT IS
IN HEAVEN.
GIVE US THIS DAY
OUR DAILY BREAD.
AND FORGIVE US
OUR TRESPASSES,
AS WE FORGIVE THOSE
WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US.
AND LEAD US NOT
INTO TEMPTATION,
BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL.
FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM,
THE POWER,
THE GLORY FOREVER
- AND EVER.

PLEASE TELL THE COURT
HOW YOU WOULD
DESCRIBE YOURSELF,
YOUR LIFESTYLE.
I DON'T KNOW.
PUNK?
"PUNK"?
FUNNY YOU WOULD SAY THAT.
BECAUSE WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY...
GIVES US
THE FOLLOWING DEFINITION
OF THIS TERM
YOU SO ELOQUENTLY USE
TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF: PUNK.
"A WORTHLESS PERSON;
AN OFTEN AGGRESSIVE
OR VIOLENT YOUNG MAN,
USUALLY A PETTY HOODLUM
OR GANGSTER;
A SOCIOPATH."
IT'S NOT ABOUT
A DEFINITION.
I WOULDN'T EXPECT
SOMEONE LIKE YOU...
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
OH, WELL, THEN
PLEASE HELP ME.
HELP THE JURY UNDERSTAND
HOW WEARING CHAINS
AND MILITARY CLOTHING
IS JUST PART
OF THE STYLE,
AND NOT WEAPONS
AT THE READY.
IT'S A STATEMENT.
OH, YOU ARE CORRECT,
IT MOST CERTAINLY IS
A STATEMENT.
BUT IT IS NOT A STATEMENT
OF FASHION,
IT'S A STATEMENT OF
MALICIOUS INTENT.
MY HEAD'S POUNDING.
IT'S NOT YOUR HEAD, MAN,
THERE'S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR.
HERSCHEL,
WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?
WHAT'S THE DEAL?
RENT WAS DUE LAST WEEK.
AH, I KNOW, I DO.
I GOT A LITTLE BEHIND.
HERE'S THIS.
IT'S SHORT.
I KNOW.
BUT JUST GIVE US
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME,
AND I PROMISE
I'LL GET YOU THE REST.
I LIKE YOU ALL
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND ALL,
BUT I NEED THE MONEY.
I CAN'T HAVE Y'ALL
SQUATTING IN HERE.
I'M ALREADY GIVING YOU
A BREAK ON PRICE, MAN.
I KNOW.
AND WE APPRECIATE IT.
I'M JUST... I'M TRYING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S...
DUDE, YOU KNOW
I'M GOOD FOR IT.
THESE SHOWS, THEY'RE STARTING
TO GO REALLY WELL.
I JUST NEED LIKE A WEEK
AND I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
ALL RIGHT, BUT THAT'S IT.
ALL RIGHT?
I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME.
I HONESTLY CAN'T WAIT
ANY LONGER, ALL RIGHT?
ONE WEEK OR I GOT TO
LOCK IT UP, MAN.
OKAY. AND, HERSCHEL,
THANK YOU.
I PROMISE,
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS.
- ALL RIGHT.
- I PROMISE.
THANK YOU.
ONE WEEK!
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE HARD
FOR YOU TO GET A JOB
LOOKING LIKE A WILD INDIAN.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, OLD
MAN, I GOT A FEW THINGS LINED UP.
OH, I'M NOT WORRIED,
THAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S JOB.
I GUESS A HELMET'S OUT
OF THE QUESTION, TOO.
I'M NOT TRYING
TO LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.
YOU COULD'VE FOOLED ME.
HOW DANGEROUS...
THIS IS THE LAST
OF THE MEGADEATH WEAPONS.
A HUGE BOMB, NINE MEGATONS.
IT HAS MORE EXPLOSIVE POWER
THAN ALL THE MISSILES FIRED
FROM ONE OF OUR NUCLEAR-ARMED
SUBMARINES TODAY.
AND COULD BE DETONATED
BY A VARIETY OF WAYS:
A SPARK, A LIGHTNING STORM
OR EVEN A HIT
COULD SET IT OFF.
BUT WE HAVE
DISMANTLED OTHERS LIKE THIS...
WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO
OUT THERE?
RAN INTO AN OLD FRIEND.
TOLD YOU I'D COME.
OH! WHO IS THIS?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK,
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN
TO TRACY AND SHE'LL GIVE YOU
A GOOD HAIRCUT.
OH!
SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA TO ME.
I SAY YOU JUST SHAVE
THE WHOLE THING.
MAKE YOU LOOK
LIKE A REAL MAN.
SMELLS GOOD, MA.
- YOU MAKE ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY?
- BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR BROTHER,
I NEVER KNOW
WHO'S GONNA BE HERE
SO I ALWAYS TRY.
OH, AND YOU CAN TAKE SOME
TO YOUR FRIENDS, TOO.
I'M SURE THEY COULD USE A GOOD
MEAL EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE.
NOT TRYING TO FEED
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.
WHAT'S COOKING, BETTY?
OH.
- YUMMY.
- COME ON, MAN.
YOU KNOW,
IT'S STRANGE,
I NEVER HEARD
ANYONE KNOCK.
VERY FUNNY, MR. D.
YOU BOYS CUT IT OUT.
HELP YOURSELF, JOHN.
THANK YOU, BETTY.
HEY, PASS THE EGGS, MAN.
I AIN'T HERE
TO SERVE YOU.
GET UP AND
GET THEM YOURSELF.

WHAT THE HELL, MOM?
THE NAME OF YOUR BAND IS
"WHITE SLAVE TRADERS"?
WE'RE ALL SLAVES

HERE AND HELP ME REAL QUICK.
DON'T TELL ME WHAT

KISS MY ASS.
I WOULD, BUT I DON'T
WANT MY LIPS TO STINK.
SHIT!
OH, WELL.
WHY DO WE
DO THIS SHIT, MAN?
'CAUSE IT'S FUN!
THIS IS WORK,
NOT FUN.
IT'S BOTH.
PLUS, WE'RE MAKING
A MARK ON THIS TOWN.
THIS TOWN
DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
SHIT, I KNOW, BUT...
THAT "AMARILLIONARE"
GAVE US SOME EXTRA CASH.
GOT TO LOVE THAT KOOKY BASTARD.
YEP, HE'S
ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO US.
YEAH, I COULD DEFINITELY
USE THE CASH.
NO, BUT FOR REAL, THOUGH,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
MAN, I JUST WANT TO START
BOOKING BIGGER BANDS, YOU KNOW?
I FEEL LIKE THE SCENE'S
- REALLY PICKING UP.
- IT'S ALL POSSIBLE, MAN,
YOU JUST GOT TO
GET THE BANDS
TO MAKE THE STOP.
YOU JUST LET ME WORRY
ABOUT THAT, ALL RIGHT?
HEY, YOU MIND
LOCKING UP?
YEAH, MAN,
WHERE YOU GOING?
- I JUST GOT SOME SHIT TO TAKE CARE OF, NO BIG DEAL.
- NEED A LIFT?
NO, NO, I'M GOOD,
I'LL MEET UP WITH Y'ALL LATER.
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
HEY, I GOT A SURPRISE
FOR Y'ALL TONIGHT, TOO.
I THINK I MIGHT
KNOW WHAT IT IS.
THINK IT'S READY?
I THINK IT'S CLOSE.

DON'T JUST SIT THERE,
GET UP

ANOTHER BEER.
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
THIS WHOLE TOWN
IS BUILT TO SUPPORT
THE ONLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS
MANUFACTURING FACILITY
IN THE NATION.
PUT IT TOGETHER, IF YOU WERE
GOING TO ATTACK AMERICA,
WOULDN'T YOU TRY TO TAKE OUT THEIR
MOST VULNERABLE WEAPONS FIRST?

LAUNCHER OR DRIVE A TANK,

MULTIPLE
POLICE REPORTS FILED
OVER THE LAST
FOUR YEARS.
ALL OF THESE REPORTS
TOOK PLACE
AT THE SAME ESTABLISHMENT
YOU FREQUENTED.
UNDERAGE DRINKING,
MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS
OF EXCESSIVE NOISE,
MULTIPLE ARRESTS, INCLUDING
MINORS IN POSSESSION OF ALCOHOL,
MINORS IN CONSUMPTION
OF ALCOHOL,
PUBLIC INTOXICATION,
DRUG PARAPHERNALIA,
RESISTING ARREST,
AND ASSAULT OF
A POLICE OFFICER.
DO YOU WISH TO DENY ANY OF
THESE TRUTHS, MISS HENDRICKS?
OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
ENDING UP BEHIND BARS
IS ALL A MATTER
OF CIRCUMSTANCE?
THEY'RE SO FAT!
LOOK AT HIM!
AW, I WANT THEM ALL!
THIS GUY.
HE'S, LIKE, PASSED OUT.
OH, HEY!
OH, NO.
OH, MY GOD.
I WANT HIM.
- I WANT ALL OF THEM.
- OH.
HEY, HEY, BUDDY.
HE'S SO LITTLE.
- HEY! HEY.
- YEAH.
COME HERE, BUD.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
LITTLE BUDDY.
IT'S NO FUN BEING
LOCKED IN A CAGE.
OH, SWEETIE.
GONNA BE LIKE SIMBA.
WHAT ABOUT "PISTOL"?
WHAT ABOUT "SHOTGUN"?
MM...
NO, NONE OF THOSE.
- HE DOESN'T LIKE 'EM?
- UH-UH.
OH.
HEY.
WHAT IS THIS,
"DESTROY EVERYTHING"?
FILTH.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU...
- FILTH.
- MM-MM.
BLATZ. SHIT SPLIT.
DOUBLE CD?
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THOSE.
OH, MY GOD, I FEEL LIKE
I FAILED YOU!
IT HURTS ME ON THE INSIDE THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
LIKE...
HELL NO.
THE ONLY THING THAT YOU
FAILED AT IS NAMING A PUPPY.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GIVE IT A GO.
GIVE ME HIM.
HI, PUPPY.
SO WHO THE FUCK
IS FILTH ANYWAY?
IT'S THE GREATEST FUCKING
BAND IN THE WORLD.
COME HERE.
MM, I'M NOT
AFRAID OF YOU.
HMM.
WHAT ABOUT "GUINNESS"?
I KIND OF
FUCKING LOVE THAT.
EXCEPT I HATE IT
'CAUSE YOU CAME UP WITH IT.
- SO...
- AH!
ALL RIGHT, WAIT,
BUT WE COULD STILL
NAME HIM AFTER
THE BEST BEER EVER.
WHAT ABOUT "STOUT"?
- HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A STOUT.
- YEAH.
YOU LIKE THAT, BUDDY?
YOU WANT TO BE
NAMED "STOUT"?
- A-HA-HA.
- "STOUT" IT IS.
- I LIKE IT.
- PERFECT.
PERFECT. STOUT.
I LOVE IT.
- HEY, WHAT'S THIS?
- HEY!
DUDE... IT'S NOTHING,
I JUST KEEP LYRICS
TO SONGS IN IT AND STUFF
AND JUST THINGS I LIKE
AND RANDOM THOUGHTS I HAVE.
SO IT'S LIKE
A FUCKING DIARY.
IT'S NOT A FUCKING DIARY!
IT'S JUST FUCKING
LYRICS AND...
RANDOM IDEAS AND...
FUCKING GIVE IT BACK!
I'LL GIVE IT BACK
ON ONE CONDITION:
YOU READ ME SOMETHING
WRITTEN BY YOU
AND NOT ANOTHER BAND.
IT'S EITHER THAT
OR YOU NEVER GET IT BACK.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
JUST GIVE IT HERE.
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE.
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE PROMISES.
SO?
ALL RIGHT, I PROMISE.
BUT, LIKE...
YOU GOT TO REALIZE THAT...
I HEAR THIS TO
REALLY LOUD MUSIC,
AND LIKE...
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HERE, LET ME SEE THAT.
JUST...
IN MY HEAD,
IT'S MOSTLY SCREAMING.
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
"MY ENTIRE LIFE,
PEOPLE TRY TO
RATTLE MY CAGE
TO FORCE ME TO EXPLODE
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
TESTING ME.
TRYING TO FIND
MY BREAKING POINT.
MY MOTHER WOULD SAY,
'SON, STEP IN FROM THE COLD, '
AND MY FATHER
JUST THE SAME.
HE'D SAY,
'DON'T EVER LOSE
YOUR SELF-CONTROL.'
BUT I OPENED THE WINDOW.
I LET THE COLD AIR FLOW.
I LOST MY SELF-CONTROL."
MM.
CODY CATES LIVED AN HONEST LIFE.
MWAH!
WENT TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY.
PLAYED FOOTBALL.
HE ALSO WAS INVOLVED
IN MANY OTHER
EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:
NATIONAL HONORS SOCIETY,
STUDENT COUNCIL,
FELLOWSHIP OF
CHRISTIAN ATHLETES.
HIS FAMILY
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROACTIVE
IN THE COMMUNITY.
IS THIS WHAT
THEY DESERVE?
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR
ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.
SO IS THIS
WHAT THEY
REALLY DESERVE?

I'M GOING WITH
OR WITHOUT YOU.
HE'S RIGHT, MAN.
SHIT'S GONE ON

HOW SERIOUS THIS IS!
FUCK!
FUCK!
FUCK!
FUCK!
FUCK!
NO...
NOT ME.
OH, GOD, NO, PLEASE.
MOM...
MOM, YOU AND DAD
NEED TO COME UP HERE.
WESTERN PLAZA.
IT'S BRIAN,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.
IT'S BAD, MA.
I DON'T KNOW.
PLEASE, JUST...
JUST COME.
I REMEMBER...
IT BEING SO COLD.
UNUSUALLY COLD.
AND THERE WAS GLASS
AND METAL EVERYWHERE.
IT WAS CHAOS.
IT... IT WAS WORSE
THAN ANY NIGHTMARE.
CODY'S THOUGHTS
THAT NIGHT
LAY IN INTIMIDATION,
IN FEAR.
BUT NOT HATRED.
YEAH, BUT WHAT HE DID
IS STILL WRONG.
AND YOU CANNOT
DEFEND WHAT HE DID.
CAN I HAVE THE KEYS, PLEASE?
CHUCK.
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU GOT?
WE BELIEVE THAT THE
EVIDENCE WILL CONVINCE YOU,
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT,
THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT,
THAT THIS IS WAS
NOT JUSTIFIED, AND...
AND THAT THE DEFENDANT
INTENTIONALLY...
AND KNOWINGLY
MURDERED BRIAN DENEKE.
HE HAD NEVER ATTEMPTED
TO APPLY HIS BRAKES
OR TURN HIS STEERING WHEEL
AS HIS CADILLAC HAD
APPROACHED BRIAN.
HE HAD FLED THE SCENE
OF A CRIME
AND HE LIED
TO THE POLICE.
WHEN THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
HAD DESCRIBED
BRIAN'S INJURIES,
HE CONCLUDED THAT BRIAN
HAD REMAINED CONSCIOUS
AS HIS BODY WAS DRAGGED UNDER
THE... UNDERNEATH THE WHEELS
OF THAT CADILLAC.
THE IMPACT...
IMPACT SO SEVERE,
THAT HIS COLLARBONE HAD BEEN
TORN FREE FROM HIS SHOULDER.
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE...
ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE AISLE
IN THIS COMMUNITY
NEED TO BE TOLD
BY THE 12 OF YOU
THAT WHAT YOU DO
CARRIES WITH IT
CONSEQUENCE.
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE.
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.
AND NO MATTER
HOW YOU DRESS.
I DON'T EXPECT
YOU TO ENJOY SENDING
THIS YOUNG MAN TO PRISON.
I DON'T.
I EXPECT YOU TO DO IT
WITH A TEAR IN YOUR EYE
AND YOUR HEART
IN YOUR THROAT.
PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY
SAID,
"WE DO THINGS,
NOT BECAUSE
THEY ARE EASY,
BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD."
TODAY I ASK YOU
TO DO THE HARD THING.
I ASK YOU TO SEND A MESSAGE
TO THIS COMMUNITY
THAT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE,
ALL OF THEM,
WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES
OF THEIR ACTIONS,
AND THAT YOU ARE HOLDING
CODY CATES
UNCONDITIONALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATH OF BRIAN DENEKE.
"DESTROY EVERYTHING."
IS THIS THE MESSAGE WE WANT
TO SEND OUR CHILDREN
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME?
"DESTROY... EVERYTHING."
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS NOT A CASE
ABOUT DIVERSITY
OR TOLERANCE,
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
JUDGING PEOPLE FOR
THE WAY THEY DRESS.
THIS CASE
IS ABOUT A GANG
OF YOUNG MEN
WHO CHOSE A LIFESTYLE
DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE
THOSE AROUND THEM,
TO CHALLENGE AUTHORITY
AND TO PROVOKE A REACTION
FROM SOCIETY
ITSELF.
WHEN THOSE PUNKS BROUGHT
BATS AND CHAINS
OUT THERE WITH THEM
TO WESTERN STREET
THAT NIGHT,
A CONSPIRACY WAS PUT
INTO PLAY
TO KILL AND MAIM THOSE
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.
CODY HAD NO TIME
TO THINK
OR PONDER,
HE HAD TO TAKE
IMMEDIATE ACTION
AND HE TOOK IT.
AND IF HE HAD TO LIVE IT
ALL OVER...
HE WOULD DO IT AGAIN.
YOU SEE,
WHAT CODY CATES FACED
OUT THERE THAT NIGHT
WAS A BAD COMBINATION:
A MEAN DRUNK WITH A WEAPON.
AND SOMEWHERE,
IN THE INFINITE PROCESSES
THAT SHAPE A BOY
INTO A MAN...
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO BRIAN DENEKE.
THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH
WAS, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE END RESULT OF A LONG LIST
OF POOR CHOICES OVER
THE LAST SIX YEARS OF HIS LIFE.
YOU COULD EVEN ARGUE
THAT HE WAS DESTINED
TO DIE THE WAY HE DID.
HE WAS A VIOLENT INDIVIDUAL.
AND IT TOOK VIOLENCE
ON CODY CATES' PART...
TO PUT AN END
TO FURTHER VIOLENCE
AND TO SAVE
AN INNOCENT LIFE.
LET THIS BOY GO HOME.
RESTORE HIM
TO HIS FAMILY.
'CAUSE HE DID
THE RIGHT THING.
THE ONE STORY THAT, UH...
THAT REALLY STRUCK ME
AND GOT ME THINKING ABOUT
THIS WAS, A FEW YEARS AGO,
THERE WAS THIS
TEENAGE PUNK ROCKER KID
WHO WAS RUN DOWN
BY A WHITE JOCK
IN DAD'S CADILLAC.
AND, UH...
THIS BOY DIED
BECAUSE HE LOOKED DIFFERENT.
SO THIS THING HAPPENS,
THIS GUY KILLS THIS KID,
AND IS CLEARLY GUILTY,
YOU KNOW,
HIS GUILT IS ADMITTED,
AND GUESS WHERE THIS
ALL-AMERICAN ATHLETE IS,
HE'S IN COLLEGE.
YOU KNOW, THE JURY FELT
THE PUNK ROCKER DESERVED TO DIE
BECAUSE HE LOOKED
THE WAY HE DID.
AND NOT ONLY WAS HE KILLED,
BUT THEN, IN THE TRIAL,
HE WAS KILLED AGAIN
BECAUSE THEY...
YOU KNOW,
CRITICIZED HIS LIFESTYLE
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T, YOU KNOW,
WEAR A TOMMY HILFIGER SHIRT
AND KHAKI PANTS, YOU KNOW?
AND THEN THE KILLER WAS EVEN
APPLAUDED AT GRADUATION
BECAUSE HE WAS
A FOOTBALL STAR.
THE AMERICAN DREAM,
STRONG, NORMAL.
HE NEVER A SPENT
A DAY IN PRISON.
SO WHO DO WE BLAME?
YOU KNOW?
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SAY,
YOU KNOW,
"TOO MUCH VIOLENCE,
TOO MUCH VIOLENCE TODAY,"
YOU KNOW?
DID EVERYONE FORGET
ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR,
OR THE BIBLE,
OR SHAKESPEARE, YOU KNOW?
VIOLENCE
ISN'T BRAND-NEW.
THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION,
YOU KNOW?
I PUT THIS UP
ON MY WEBSITE.
I SAID, "IS ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
KILLING OUR CHILDREN,
OR IS KILLING OUR CHILDREN
ENTERTAINING ADULTS?"
I THINK THAT'S KIND
OF THE QUESTION
WE GOT TO ASK
OURSELVES TODAY.
AND, YES, ASK YOURSELF
THAT EVERY TIME
YOU WATCH THE HUNGRY CAMERAS
AT THE CRIME SCENE,
OR AT THE FUNERAL,
OR AT THE PLANE CRASH.
YOU KNOW, I'M IN A SQUARE RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME,
I'M LOOKING AT MYSELF
IN A MONITOR, YOU KNOW?
WE SIT IN FRONT
OF THE TV
AND WE ARE THE TV.
WE'RE A COPY
STARING AT A COPY...
AT A COPY
AND A COPY.
EVENTUALLY IT'S A XEROX
THAT'S SO DEGENERATED,
WE DON'T KNOW
WHICH CAME FIRST.
AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH.
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO,
I'M A FUCKING ANARCHIST!

THE KILLING
OCCURRED DURING A FIGHT
BETWEEN THE PUNKS AND
A GROUP CALLED "THE PREPS,"
WHICH INCLUDED THE CHILDREN
OF SOME OF AMARILLO'S
WEALTHIEST CITIZENS.
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO PRISON,
HE WAS PUT ON PROBATION
AND ALLOWED TO GO FREE.
FREE.
