You can find any place from anywhere.
Listen to me. We can find out how
fast passenger trains went back then.
We take that speed,
multiply it by the hours
that you were on the train.
That's it. We create a search radius.
And inside there, you'll find
the station with the rain tank.
Yeah, but it would take
a lifetime to search
