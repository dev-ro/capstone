Film: Red Sorghum
Filmized by Moyan's novel:
<<Red Sorghum>> and <<Kaoliang Spirit>>.
I will tell you something
about my grandpa and grandma.
It is still being refered
nowadays in my hometown.
Someone beliefs and others
do not belief as time goes by.
This is my grandma.
She was married in July 9th that year.
Her husband was a shopkepper in
Shibali Po called Big Head Lee.
He was not married
untill over 50 years old.
Because everyone knew
that he was a lazar.
It is said that: when you are crying on
a sedan, you are not safe in the future.
If you lift the cloth on
your head, you are in trouble.
Get into the sedan!
As usual.
Someone will play tricks
on bride on the road.
The people carried sedan and
trumpeted were Big Head Lee's worker.
There was only one clergyman employed.
He was quite famous in my hometown.
He bacame my grandpa later.
Bride on sedan, do not keek.
talk with us.
It is boring in the sedan.
It is said that: When you are boring, talk with
someone; When you are in trouble, sing a song.
I can teach you.
Keeking is no use now.
It is not easy for us to carry you once.
Yes, not easy.
Whose daughter is it? What a pity.
Her parents are so cruelhearted.
They only take money into account.
She will be painful in the future.
His parents only think about money....
Big Head Lee is badly illed.
He will never recover.
Yes, he will never recover.
You can not live with Big Head Lee.
Or you will be badly illed.
Yes, badly illed.
If you regret now, we
will carry you back.
You say one word, and
we will carry you back.
We are waiting for you.
Sing a song, Please.
Silence? we will make you say something.
Tuba.
Go!
From my grandma's home to Shibali
Po, It will pass QingShaKou.
No one knows from when
QingShaKou is full of sorghum.
No one plant and no one harvest.
They all say that
these are wild sorghum.
And is often haunted.
Stop.
Do not run.
Lay the sedan down.
Money!
I am bald and erevyone call
me "Special bald with gun".
Money or I will shoot!
Uncoil belt.
Bring the money and belt here.
All go behind the sedan.
Do not look back.
Squat.
Do not look back or I will shoot.
Get off and go.
Go to the sorghum field.
Go quickly!
No look!Go!
Beat!Beat here!
Beat!Beat!
He is so weak. He is dead.
He is not bald. He has hair.
The gun is bogus too.
He is bodacious indeed.
Tuba is yours.
There are not many people
living in Shibali Po.
And the shopkepeer is a lazar.
People seldom come here
except those who buy alcohol.
It is conventional to bring
the bride back in my hometown.
That day, My grandgrandpa
took her back home.
You must come back, dear,
back to Lee's family.
How luxury!
They give us a mule without thinking.
Though you are not willing.
Dont't throw the scissor.
You should be back and
come back to the family Lee.
Daughter, why are you in such a hurry?
Daughter, it has been really a
long time since you went to pee.
How did you pee?
Girl, go and just go bravely.
Go forward and do not look back.
There are thousands
of ways to the heaven.
Thousands of...
Girl, go and just go bravely.
Go forward and do not look back.
From now on you...
... throw away the red embroidery ball.
What a big red embroidery ball.
It just hits on my head.
Let's have a drink.
The red jowar alcohol.
Actor, get out!
You gay man!
What a rubbish tune you are singing.
Girl, go and just go bravely.
Go forward and do not look back.
What are you doing? You don't
have dinner and want to be god?
You have such a good luck, but
you cannot get awared of that.
Look at the family Lee, they
give us a big black emule.
Go back and enjoy your life.
Look to the future, all the fortune
of the family Lee will belong to you.
What are people living for?
Since you've married, you will become the
member of the family Lee without any doubt.
Be quick, finish the dinner and go back.
I'll go, I will.
You are not my dad, and I
don't have a dad like you.
You just want me to exchange for a big
black emule, and you go and live with it.
I will go, I will, and
I will never come back.
Bitch, it's not such an easy thing.
I and your mom get you
born, and is it easy for us?
When my granni was shouting at her
dad, something happened at Shibali Po.
Big head-Lee was killed.
No one knew who had done that.
But I always think
that it was my grandpa.
But until he passed
away I have kept this.
Da Zhuang and Er zhuang, let's
go and we can live anywhere.
This lepra place, bad luck.
After this woman is married
bad things begin to appear.
This is really evil, so quiet.
The boss disappeared again,
and all the doors are locked.
This pan is still on the kang.
I heard that one shoe is found
under the Qing Sha Bridge.
He may be killed.
Talk of the Qing Sha
Bridge, it will be not easy.
Several people of county came two days ago, and
they searched for three days, but nothing was found.
Who did this?
This old man is a bad guy and
it must be someone to revenge.
You see, the killer didn't
crack the trunks and doors.
He just wanted him dead.
This woman is not a good person either,
and she always makes some trouble.
From the day when she came, she
began to flirt with the muscle man.
Hey, don't think too much, we should
pack our stuff and go tomorrow.
Don't make any trouble.
I'm in.
Come in.
I haven't got my pants on.
Er Dengzi's dad, why
are you still drinking?
Hey, you again.
Go back to home and sleep.
I saw that woman sit in the
courtyard alone just now.
It's awfully dark.
Oh, ask her to move here.
Are you going nuts?
She's afraid to be in the
house and get sick, poor woman.
Boss?
This jowar alcohol can
cure all the illness.
Please don't leave.
I want to say something, our
rack boiler cannot disband.
Brother Arhat.
Brother Arhat, how long have
you been in the family Lee?
All the things will depend on you.
I, a woman, just depend on everyone.
If there is still someone who don't
want to stay, I won't keep you here.
The hire of this month
will be paid as usual.
If you still want to come back later,
you are still our man in the rack boiler.
I think all of you stay.
Everyone will share the profit.
Is that OK?
OK, all stay.
Yes, stay and won't leave any more.
listen to him.
Let's stay here.
Don't call me boss, I'm
also born of a poor family.
We're all fair here.
I rank 9 at home, born at Sep. 9th.
People call me Jiu-er, and you too.
Jiu-er.
Shall we tidy up the courtyard?
We're afraid of the virus
here. Let's do a sweepup.
From now on, uou are the
boss, tell us what to do.
Yes, tell us.
We'll obey your order, Jiu-er.
Well, stop the fire for 2 days.
You sweep the house for me.
Burn everything that the elder
boss ever used, or bury them.
Luo Han, buy some whitewash
to wash the whole backyard.
Then sprinkle the kaoliang
spirit here three times.
Didn't you say that the kaoliang
spirit could treat any disease?
Today we'll use it to
disinfect the atomsphere here.
I have disinfected the
key with wine three times.
Mine is yours, keep it.
It was in the kaoliang filed.
I can walk by myself, I can.
You must have forgot.
I haven't catch the words.
Then what happened after that?
I pulled down the
kaoliang, then she lay down.
Once she lay down, I got the signal.
You guys, don't accost with him anymore.
Yes, let's go out.
Go out, it's near my house.
Here... Go the house there.
I'll sleep here.
From now on, I'll sleep here.
This is mine, that's our boss's.
The boss? Who's the fuck boss?
What are you saying? Big head-Lee
Who is fucking big head-Lee?
I won't	fear even if he was alive.

My grandfather lay in
