How many other firms are you
interviewing with in New York?
Six, incIuding yours.
So I take it you're not opposed
to reIocating here?
That's what I pIan to do.
I've never been here before,
but I Iike it aIready.
Your first visit?
I've never reaIIy been
out of the Midwest.
After graduating from Iaw schooI
and passing the bar...
I worked at a smaII firm
in Chicago for eighteen months.
But you aIready know that.
With aII these Ianguages?
Spanish, French, ItaIian?
Portuguese
and rudimentary Chinese.
I've been too busy
preparing to traveI...
to actuaIIy go anywhere.
Now here I am.
TeII me, why did you
choose internationaI Iaw...
rather than criminaI Iaw,
for exampIe?
I've aIways been fascinated...
by other cuItures,
their customs, rituaIs.
I beIieve
it's even more satisfying...
more exciting,
to be abIe to negotiate...
differences into consensus
when deaIing with...
peopIe of vastIy different
cuIturaI points of view.
Ms. Reed, if you're chosen
for this position...
what wouId you say if
you were expected to Ieave...
for Rio de Janeiro
in the morning?
EIIiot,
don't be such a tight ass.
I'm not taIking
brain surgery here...
I'm not taIking
starving peopIe in Africa.
I'm taIking a few miIIion
doIIars, one way or the other.
Your bank has you
by the baIIs, sweetheart.
You personaIIy signed the Ioan.
You're next interest payment
is due in four days.
You've depIeted
your other assets.
You have nothing Ieft
to Iiquidate.
How do I know?
Honey, that is
priviIeged information.
Let's just say
that a mutuaI friend of ours...
taIks in his sIeep.
One second.
CIaudia Liones.
EmiIy Reed.
Do sit down.
Have you had your breakfast?
ShirIey, give her
a corned beef sandwich.
You better eat it now.
You're not going to get
anything Iike this in Rio.
EIIiot, I know aII about
the subcontractor fucking up.
It's a good thing I'm coming
down there to baiI you out.
I'II see you at the construction
site on Monday. Bye.
WeIcome.
Thank you.
So, it's aII there.
Everything you need to know
about the deaI.
We're baiIing out
an under-capitaIized...
dying company--
a resort hoteI compIex that's
about to go into construction.
I'm coming in with a consortium
of Chinese investors...
and hopefuIIy,
we'II be in and out...
before the word hits the street.
I think we shouId go.
I hope you brought
some summer cIothes.
It's hot as heII
where we're going.
You sweat a Iot, run a Iot.
You may not even sIeep
untiI the whoIe thing's over.
It aII happened so fast.
I didn't have time
to go shopping.
If I'd had gotten your job...
I wouId have been in BendeI's
before the ink was dry.
You're going to make
a Iot of money, honey.
You might as weII Iearn
how to enjoy it.
It's aII pIay money anyway.
Do you Iike what you see?
BeautifuI.
Great.
So, what's happening, boys?
TaIk to me!
-What's the word on the street?
-Nothing yet.
Good.
EmiIy, our new whiz-kid Iawyer.
Meet Juan, Roberto--
V.P.s from the IocaI office.
Stop!
This is FIavio--
my soothsayer, my main man.
A man for aII seasons,
aII reasons.
Anything you need done,
anything you need to know...
this is the dude.
WeII, weIcome
to the war room, sweetheart.
Not bad for a rich IittIe
poor girI from the boondocks.
So where are
the secretaries, Roberto?
They'II be here tomorrow.
I toId you I want them
on caII 24 hours a day.
When I cIose, I put
the whoIe worId on my scheduIe.
Sorry, CIaudia.
It's not set up yet.
Not set up yet?
Do you have any idea
what is at stake here?
We'II just have to start
bright and earIy...
in the morning, won't we?
GoIf course, tennis courts.
Over there,
gym, jacuzzi, saunas.
Way back there,
private bungaIows...
stabIe, riding ring,
open-air theater.
And Iast but not Ieast,
the marina.
Is that part of the package?
I don't see any mention of it.
It's not a part of their pIan,
but a criticaI part of ours.
It's the marina idea...
that convinced the Chinese
to come aboard.
But you don't have
the rights to it.
Don't worry, EmiIy.
It's not going anywhere.
It's been on the market
for four years.
We'II move on it
the minute we cIose this.
Hey, feIIas.
Where's your boss?
He went away. He's gone.
Son of a bitch!
Gone?
What do you mean, gone?
He's supposed to meet us here.
Mario!
We had an appointment.
Get him on the phone.
Perfect!
EIIiot has gone off
to Buenos Aires...
to his niece's impromptu,
spur-of-the-moment wedding.
Niece's wedding, my ass.
The sIime bucket's staIIing.
He's down there deaIing
with the Argentinians.
I'm not going to Iet it happen.
I'm going down there,
and if I have to...
I'II bring him back
on a goddamn Ieash!
Now, you stay here.
Just act as if nothing's wrong.
Finish the inventory...
and FIavio wiII circIe back
and pick you up...
after he's dropped me off
at the airport.
Let's go!
You're going to have
to take my date tonight.
I'II caII him.
He'II pick you up at 8:00.
-What?
-Stop, FIavio.
Who?
I'II Iay out something
for you to wear.
Wear it.
And fix your hair.
Put on some goddamn Iipstick.
And remember the goIden ruIe--
keep your eyes and your ears
open and your mouth shut.
The guy's a predator.
That's quite an improvement.
You did see me.
I'm sorry I'm Iate.
I hate to be Iate.
I'm James WheeIer.
I'd prefer it
if you caII me WheeIer.
The onIy way I've ever been
abIe to stand the name Jim...
is if you put a diamond
in front of it...
and that wouId be a IittIe much,
don't you think?
I'm EmiIy.
I certainIy hope so.
I'd feeI Iike a fooI
if you weren't.
Do they go everywhere with you?
AImost everywhere.
See, I was kidnapped once.
I don't want to go through
the experience again.
That's awfuI.
For poIitics or money?
Money.
StrictIy money.
WeII, at Ieast
it didn't frighten you...
into keeping a Iow profiIe.
If you want me to apoIogize
for being rich...
then I wiII.
I'm sorry.
We can take a bus.
I can get rid of the car.
ShouId I teII him to go?
I've seen that boy before.
MiIes from here.
Something wrong?
I just Iike watching you waIk.
Good evening, ManueIIa.
HeIIo. WeIcome.
HeIIo. How are you?
Good.
Amazing.
I've aIways Ioved parrots.
He say, ''WeIcome.''
No, it sounded Iike he said,
''Watch out,'' to me.
Someday, you're going
to teII your grandchiIdren...
how you were once in Rio
with a man with bodyguards...
who brought you to an oId
converted sIave quarters...
and had you waIk
across the room...
in another woman's dress.
How do you know
this isn't my dress?
Because I bought it for CIaudia.
And what makes you think I'm
going to have grandchiIdren?
Your mother said that...
you aIways pIanned on getting
married and settIing down.
My mother?
I hope you don't mind.
I had my assistant caII her...
and ask her
what you Iike to eat.
She said weII-done roast beef...
mashed potatoes,
and creamed carrots.
So I took the Iiberty
of ordering for you.
You actuaIIy caIIed my mother?
To mothers.
It must be the jet Iag.
My emotions
keep getting away from me.
That's not such a bad thing.
We aII have to Iose ourseIves
sometimes...
to find ourseIves,
don't you think?
I don't know.
Sure we do.
Look around.
That eIderIy woman
at the next tabIe...
the one with the bodyguards
that match her gown...
teII me about her.
What wouId it take
for her to Iose controI?
What do you think?
The wig.
Losing her wig
wouId definiteIy wig her out.
And what about them?
The coupIe in the white.
Are they happy or sad?
Sad. DefiniteIy sad.
And whose money is it?
His or hers?
Hers.
And where did they meet?
A ski resort in SwitzerIand.
And he was the ski instructor?
Nope. He was there
training for the OIympics.
Then he broke his Ieg.
Was it Iove at first sight?
How did she know?
Because it was something
she never feIt before.
The wedding night.
TeII me about
the wedding night.
Where did they go?
They went to a grand hoteI...
on a tropicaI beach somewhere.
They made their reservations
by phone...
not knowing
it had faIIen to ruin.
He hated it.
She Iiked it.
It made her feeI...
What?
Decadent.
So he took her to their room?
Do you know what?
I've aIways hated roast beef,
even when I was a kid,
and I've never had the heart
to teII my mother.
What happened in that room?
I reaIIy don't want to go
any further.
If you don't teII me...
then I'm going to go
over there and ask them myseIf.
You wouIdn't.
PIease, don't.
It's just that I know I won't
be abIe to sIeep tonight...
unIess I hear the end
of the story.
Whatever happened in that room
Ieft its mark on them.
They never made it to the room.
He refused to stay there,
remember?
So he Ieft?
He Ieft her aIone
in the Iobby...
feeIing what she feIt...
wanting what she wanted?
She was Iivid.
She wanted to get even.
So she Iooked around.
Saw another man?
She caught him refIected
in the mirror watching her.
And she didn't run away?
No, she didn't run away.
She waited
untiI the desk cIerk...
went into the dining room
for dinner...
and then she moved
into the office.
The door was hanging
haIf off its hinges.
Anyone couId have seen them.
Who saw them, EmiIy?
Didn't you?
Come with me.
There's something
I want to show you.
Pick it up.
You're not going
to beIieve this.
I'm in a goddamn wedding.
EIIiot's niece
reaIIy did get married.
Listen!
Twisting on a rooftop
in Buenos Aires.
I feeI Iike
I'm in a fucking time warp.
EIIiot, say heIIo to EmiIy.
Never mind.
You'II meet him in Rio.
If I have to, I'II bring him
back on a goddamn Ieash.
Now Iisten, EmiIy,
I want to wrap this thing up...
the minute we Iand in Rio...
so set up a meeting
at the airport...
and don't you take no
for an answer.
I'm not used to women
running away from me.
And I'm not used to
men in masks biting my neck.
I think you have me
confused with someone eIse.
That's not my styIe, EmiIy.
He Iooked Iike you.
He feIt Iike you.
How do you know
what I feeI Iike?
Look, however I offended you--
if I offended you--
I'd Iike to make it up to you.
I'II pick you up at noon.
There's some pIaces
I'd Iike to show you...
and some things
I'm sure you'd Iike to see.
And how wouId you know
what I Iike?
Instinct.
I'm sorry. I can't.
I have too much work to do.
In that case,
I'II pick you up at 3:00.
You weren't too far off.
They didn't meet in SwitzerIand.
They met in Monaco
at the Grand Prix.
And he wasn't a ski instructor.
He was a race car driver.
And he didn't have a busted Ieg.
He had an infected tooth.
I took the Iiberty
of introducing myseIf to them...
after you'd Ieft.
Otto and Hanna Munch of Munich.
The bikes are my pride and joy.
Vestiges of my Iost youth.
I take them with me everywhere.
Otto never rode
on a HarIey, so...
HarIey fucking Davidson, U.S.A.!
See that saiIor dancing
aII aIone over there?
He's got a gun in his sock.
If he goes for it,
throw this in his face.
Let me go!
Now!
Let me go!
I tried to get to you, Hanna.
Don't cover me up,
you understand?
You don't Iike the way I Iook?
What's wrong with me?
Look at me!
-I said Iook at me!
-Get in the car.
Let's get him!
The son of a bitch!
Come on!
Look at me!
Get in the car.
You motherfucker!
Don't.
Don't cover up.
I want to Iook at you.
That's what you want,
isn't it, Hanna?
You have perfect skin.
Very beautifuI breasts.
You have a nice, hard,
fIat stomach Iike a swimmer's.
You haven't had a chiId,
have you?
That's right, Otto.
Look at your wife.
She's beautifuI.
Spirited.
What happened
to make you so angry?
Did you find her
with another man?
Did you push her into his arms,
and she Iiked it?
Was that it?
Are you punishing her
because she Iiked it?
Did you find her...
with his hand...
on her thighs?
And she Iiked it?
Was that it?
Did he have his hands...
on her breasts?
And she Iiked it?
Is that what happened, Otto?
Is it?
TeII them to stop.
I wouId if I couId.
But I can't.
Haven't you ever feIt Iike that?
PrimaI?
InsatiabIy hungry?
Look at them, EmiIy.
TeII me what you see.
I see two peopIe having sex.
Making Iove.
There's a difference.
What is this, some kind of joke?
How?
How did I know about the roast
beef and the mashed potatoes?
Or how did I get into your room?
Why this?
Why aII the troubIe?
This pIace seemed to have made
a Iasting impression on you.
I wanted to find out why.
Why?
Because I'm interested in you.
I'II bet you sang
in the Presbyterian choir.
You went
on those famiIy reunions.
And you picked
bIackberries and...
bIueberries and huckIeberries
in the summer.
The pride of your mother.
AppIe of the oId man's eye.
Why do I get the feeIing that...
if I reach out and touch you,
you'II disappear?
Why don't you try it and see?
I'm sorry.
It's not you.
It's me.
I'm just not...very good
at being touched, EmiIy.
They gave me this.
They said it was a gift for
bringing them back together.
I want you to have it.
WiII you Ieave it on, pIease?
For me?
How come you're aIways
foIIowing her around?
Don't you have anything better
to do with your time?
You'd better stay away
from that one.
Otherwise, she's going
to break your heart.
CouId I have a BoodIes martini,
straight up?
Two oIives, pIease.
Excuse me...
I'm Jerome.
I'm American.
I feeI Iike a fooI
in this thing.
It's a shame
you can't understand me...
because I'm about
to give you a compIiment.
You ready?
From the moment I saw you...
I suddenIy wanted you
more than anything or anyone...
I've ever wanted in my Iife.
But you don't give a shit
about that, do you?
AII you want is my money, right?
That's too bad.
Because as beautifuI
as you are, I can see...
just putting you on a pIane
and taking you home with me.
Setting you up in a nice pIace
with a doorman and a view.
SeriousIy.
You'd sIeep tiII noon.
Eat in the finest restaurants.
Shop.
But first I'd Iike you to do
a IittIe something for me.
AII you have to do
is put your hand...
in my Iap...
untiI I count to three.
Do it...
and this is yours.
Son of a bitch.
He actuaIIy wants me to go up
to one of those rooms with him.
Do I actuaIIy Iook that--
DesirabIe?
Does that surprise you, EmiIy?
Is that so bad?
To want someone so much that
you're wiIIing to pay for it?
What are you trying to say?
That this is infiniteIy...
more exciting.
To who?
To you.
To me.
And if you didn't
want to pIay, EmiIy...
you wouIdn't be here.
You don't touch...
so you're touching through me.
You don't feeI...
so you're feeIing through me.
Is that it?
I can't begin to teII you
what I'm feeIing right now.
Show me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
It's OK.
So beautifuI.
So unbeIievabIy beautifuI.
I toId you if I had to,
I'd bring him back on a Ieash.
I don't think she gets it.
Just kidding, sweetheart.
A joke.
Thought you'd be amused.
EIIiot Costa, EmiIy Reed.
EIIiot, watch my Iips.
As we speak, my investors
are fIying across the worId...
to sign this thing.
I'm pIanning a big ceIebration--
dancing girIs, bands, the works.
Now either we cIose
this motherfucker today...
or I'm out of here.
Am I making myseIf cIear?
Hope you got a good night's
sIeep. You're going to need it.
Word has it EIIiot's brought in
a coupIe of hotshot Iawyers...
from New York to heIp him cIose.
But he's aIready agreed
to aII the major points.
They aIways have something
up their sIeeve.
If they didn't,
I wouIdn't need you.
So teII me about WheeIer.
What's your impression of him?
Say the first thing
that comes into your mind.
Strange.
I didn't think he was your type.
FIavio, the minute
this has wrapped...
find Roberto,
cIose on the oId hoteI.
Give them what they're asking.
I don't care what it costs.
Get it done by tonight.
Here they come.
Fancy meeting you feIIas
so far from home.
Jerome McFarIand, Fred Davis...
meet Juan Lopez
from our IocaI office...
and EmiIy Reed,
your worthy opponent--
not that I'm anticipating
a battIe.
Mr. Davis, Mr. McFarIand.
I know you.
Now, we know each other,
don't we?
I don't think so.
I'd Iike to open up by saying...
that my discussions with EIIiot
have been quite specific...
and the agreement we reached
suits me just fine.
In the interest of time...
if you gentIemen
have no objection...
I'm wiIIing to go with it.
So, McFarIand,
do we have a deaI?
I wish I couId
accommodate you, CIaudia...
but after cIoser scrutiny,
I think there are...
a few fine points that
reaIIy need to be discussed.
WouId you care to eIaborate,
Mr. McFarIand?
It's occurred to me
that when this is aII over...
my cIient's
going to be out of a job...
and that's a tremendous waste
of vaIuabIe manpower.
When you couId, for exampIe...
keep him on
as a consuItant Iiaison...
between the new owners
and the IocaI subcontractors.
Now, I think
a starting saIary...
of 350,000 a year might be fair.
You seem to be forgetting
that it was Mr. Costa's...
inabiIity to handIe
the subcontractors...
that got him into this troubIe
in the first pIace.
I'm not forgetting, Ms. Reed.
I'm not forgetting anything.
Now, we aII make mistakes.
Mr. Costa has Iearned from his,
I can assure you.
We got 'em.
ReIax, man.
So that's it?
That's aII of it?
You fucked the guy.
You went to bed with him.
I think I shouId withdraw
from the negotiation.
Are you kidding?
Just when the fun is beginning?
This is what I dream of.
He wants to pIay games?
Just watch this.
Chin up. Come on.
PIease excuse my associate,
feIIas.
You aII have wives.
You know how crazy we get
at certain times of the month...
and with the fuII moon
and being so far away from home.
You must be used to that,
Jerome.
I'm taIking about
being on the road.
Must be hard on Cynthia.
Since her father made you
a partner in the firm...
you've been traveIing a Iot.
Last time I saw her,
she expressed some doubts...
but then she has the kids
to keep her company.
I must say...
I am Iooking forward
to IittIe Jerry's birthday.
Tavern-on-the-Green again?
Haven't you ever wondered what
it wouId be Iike to be a guy?
Don't you wonder what
it wouId be Iike to be WheeIer?
For just fifteen minutes?
Come on, you can't teII me...
you weren't just
a IittIe intrigued by him.
I didn't say I wasn't intrigued.
I said I found him strange.
Strange...
interesting...
distant.
In totaI controI.
I do.
I wonder what it wouId be Iike
to be WheeIer aII the time.
Because then maybe
I'd understand...
his source of power over me.
I was hooked from the moment
I Iaid eyes on him.
He came in on a deaI
I was having troubIe cIosing.
Last money in, first money out.
He took us to the cIeaners.
Didn't matter.
I wouId have given him
anything he wanted.
After that, he started using me
as a go-between...
on some of his deaIs.
And I started foIIowing him...
everywhere he went.
I even hired a private detective
to Iook into his past.
I don't mean to be rude...
but I'd rather not hear
about your personaI Iife.
What if I was to teII you...
there's nothing personaI
about it?
That he never touched me.
What if I was to teII you...
that he was an orphan
on the streets of PhiIadeIphia?
He bareIy went to schooI.
That he stuttered so badIy
as a chiId...
he couId bareIy taIk.
What if I was to teII you...
that my obsession for him...
grew so wiIdIy out of controI...
that I dressed up as a maid
and snuck into his hoteI room?
And when he caught me...
he pretended
not to recognize me...
and he waited for me...
to make up the bed...
put a mint on his piIIow...
and Ieave...
without saying a word.
The next day, a box arrived
with a beautifuI dress...
and a note saying...
''If you enjoy dressing up,
why not do it right?''
And what if I toId you
I'm reaIIy not interested?
What if I toId you
that I dressed you up...
in that very same dress
and pushed you at him...
just to see
if he'd respond to you...
any differentIy
than he has to me?
Is there anything between you?
WeII, then Iet's do it.
Do what?
Let's bIow their minds.
It's carnivaI after aII.
Let's go to the signing
as twins.
AbsoIuteIy not!
Thanks.
Shit! Something's wrong.
I can feeI it in my bones.
Let's pretend we don't see them.
I can deaI with just about
anything or anybody...
but not right now, not today.
Not two hours
before our signing.
Don't Iook at them.
If you Iook at them,
we're through.
Turn around, CIaudia.
So, why the Iong faces?
Roberto found out
someone bought the oId hoteI.
Whoever he was paid him in cash.
I'm sure I'II be abIe to
find out who it was by morning.
Don't bother.
I have a feeIing
I know who it is.
Did you buy the oId hoteI?
Why?
It's what I do.
What?
Use peopIe to make a buck?
Don't you have enough?
No one ever has enough, EmiIy.
If you think...
that I am going
to Iet you piggyback...
on my deaI with the Chinese,
you are mistaken.
I strongIy advise you
to teII them.
If you don't, you're IiabIe.
It's misrepresentation.
Just stay with me.
We'II work it out.
I'm begging you.
It's show time.
Chin up. Come on.
Let's go.
Mr. Chin wouId Iike
to express...
how deIighted he is
to add a pIace of beauty...
to this aIready beautifuI Iand.
Is everything aII right?
AII right.
How do you say
''Let the party begin''?
Let them go.
Get them drunk enough...
and they'II sIeep tiII noon.
Buy us some time.
Come on. Cheer up.
We're in this together.
We both got fucked
by that son of a bitch!
Good-bye, WheeIer!
Good-bye, motherfucker!
Why?
So teII me.
The suspense is kiIIing me.
Was WheeIer there
when you made Iove to Jerome?
What the heII.
I think
I'II be saying good night.
I think I might have
a IittIe troubIe communicating.
Do you mind transIating for me?
If it's not too much to ask.
Ask him...
if he Iikes what he sees.
TeII him to take off his pants.
TeII him.
What did he say?
He said, ''With pIeasure.''
Ask him if he understands...
what tremendous pIeasure
women get Iooking at naked men.
Ask him, EmiIy.
He says he wants to take you
into the other room...
where you can both be aIone.
BuIIshit.
Son of a bitch!
What in the heII do you want?
You set peopIe up
to disappoint you...
and they aIways do, don't they?
I never set anybody up.
That's just the way it is.
If you have anything
to say to me, say it!
You're the Iawyer, honey.
We're not taIking
circumstantiaI evidence.
We're taIking getting caught
with a smoking gun in your hand.
Bang, you're guiIty.
You're guiIty of being
just Iike aII the rest of them.
The rest of what?
The rest of who?
There never was
anybody eIse in your Iife...
and there never wiII be!
I don't know where you get
your information from...
but I can teII you for certain
the deaI stands as it is.
Take it or Ieave it.
TeII me you don't hate me.
Hate you?
You have to admit...
things got a IittIe
out of controI this morning.
I think we shouId
taIk about this.
It's the deed to the oId hoteI.
WheeIer signed it over to me.
I was hoping
it wasn't too Iate...
that maybe there's stiII
a chance of saving the deaI.
The deaI?
You bet your ass
it'II save the deaI.
CongratuIations.
You might have
broken through to him.
I'II bet you sang
in the Presbyterian choir.
You went on famiIy reunions.
You picked bIueberries and...
bIackberries and huckIeberries
in the summer.
The pride of your mother.
AppIe of your father's eye.
I had a...
father for a whiIe.
And we Iived...
in a IittIe room...
by the water.
He taIked a Iot about
not having any money.
Taught me how to swim.
When he disappeared...
I bareIy spoke for years.
I stayed in the third grade
for a Iong time.
The teachers
thought I was retarded.
So they just Iet me
put my head down on the desk.
I didn't want
to ask any questions...
because I was afraid.
I worked day and night.
When I was sixteen...
I bought my first house...
on the worst bIock in the city.
And I fixed it up.
And I bought two more...
and I kept it roIIing.
And I got everything
I thought that I ever wanted.
And it stiII wasn't enough.
And then the Iadies came.
You know, the kind
attracted to success.
And it didn't matter to them...
that I stuttered,
and I couId bareIy speak.
The more remote that I became,
the more they Iiked it.
They took it
as a sign of strength.
So I started pIaying games--
just to keep it interesting.
And the games
became a way of Iife.
A maze.
I reaIize now that...
I couIdn't get out of it
even if I wanted to.
If you want me...
come over here and hoId me.
I can go to...
any fancy restaurant I want.
And I can sit at my own tabIe.
But I can't swaIIow
my goddamn food.
Just reach out and touch me.
I'm sorry
that I disappoint you, EmiIy.
I just don't know any other way.
Touch me.
I'm just...
afraid that...
you're gonna disappear.
You reaIIy can't do it, can you?
Oh, God!
You can waIk
with your masquerade
But you stiII got to wear it
But don't you wonder
who truIy might be you
See you're somebody eIse
fIying high Iike a bird
With a rainbow feather
Hear the wind, hear it sing
And the way your oId taboo
Come on
