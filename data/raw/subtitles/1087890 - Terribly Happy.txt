Here, the earth rocks when you walk.
The watertable's high here, you see.
When it rains,
the fields turn into a giant swarnp.
That's when the cattle sink in
and have to be hauled out with chains.
Once a cow sank so deep
into the rnud, it vanished.
Six rnonths later it turned up again,
inflated like a ballcon.
It gave birth to a two-headed calf
with a calf's head and a hurnan head.
You've got to keep such a freak
out of sight. Everyone knows that.
Still, the farmer kept it. Scon after
the cattle got rnad cows disease -
- and the wornen lost
their unborn children and their rninds.
The rnen gathered at the bar, -
- and one early rnorning
they durnped the beast in the bog -
- where it sank with a wretched roar.
Since then, there hasn't been any fuss
with neithercattle norwornen.
THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS
You just snapped? Or...
Hell, it can happen to the best of us.
You're getting a second chance.
That's the good thing about the police.
- I don't suppose much happens here.
- When it does, just report it to me.
- So I know you've got a handle on it.
- Of course.
We'll soon have you back
in Copenhagen. If you want to go back.
- You might like it out here.
- I doubt it.
What if you find yourself
a new little missus here, eh?
He's here.
- Alone?
- With the chief from Tønder.
Mojn. That's what we say here.
It means both hello and goodbye.
If the chumps give you any trouble,
just call Tønder.
Hi there.
Oh, hi.
Dr. Zerlang, the local quack.
- Robert.
- I live across the street.
- Wielcome. How was your trip?
- Longer than I'd expected.
I'm from Copenhagen, too. Or Virum.
But that's the same thing overhere.
I only meant to stay
for a couple of weeks.
Wie've got lots to talk about, you and I.
It's going to be great.
- Do you play cards?
- Sorry, I don't play.
Yourpredecessor did. And so
does the shopkeeper and the priest.
Wiell, I'm afraid I don't.
The locals had rather seen a marshall
with local blood in his veins.
- They like to handle things themselves.
- I see.
Good thing for everyone
I'm only here for a short while, then.
I actually came to give you this.
It belonged to the old marshall, and
I've been looking after it until you came.
Otherwise it's going into the bog.
You've reached Josefine,
Hanne and Squeaky.
We can't answerthe phone right now.
Leave a rnessage afterthe beep.
Mojn.
Hello.
You won't find anyone.
The new guy's gone.
- The new guy?
- He's newer than the old guy, anyway.
- From Tønder. But no one used him.
- Why not?
Ingelise Buhl from the machine pool.
You're new, too.
- For a brief spell.
- Good... that you're here, I mean.
- He just up and left his shop?
- No, he disappeared.
- Disappeared?
- The way people disappear here.
- I'd better not say any more.
- Mojn.
- Mojn.
- We have reserved seats here.
Funny, the old marshall always
came in for his beer around this time.
I'm the new marshall
so I just want a soda.
- Mineral water?
- Please.
- Where's the new bicycle dealer?
- Has he disappeared?
If you can't find him,
maybe you should see a cycleologist.
Cycleologist.
You've reached Josefine,
Hanne and Squeaky.
We can't answerthe phone right...
Is this a bad time?
It's me with the bike.
Forget what I said about
the bicycle dealer. About the bog.
- You didn't mention the bog.
- Just forget it.
- Is anything wrong?
- Can I trust you?
I am the marshall.
- What if you want a divorce?
- Not really a police matter, huh.
- If yourhusband beats you?
- Does he?
Yesterday, he slapped me.
- Just like that?
- Just because I said you looked good.
- Your picture was in the weekly.
- Wiell, that's asking for it, isn't it?
- Do you want to report him?
- I talked to the old marshall about it.
He told Jørgen so I got another beating.
Amonth ago Dr. Zerlang had
to stitch me up. Look.
- You shouldn't put up with that.
- I have a daughter.
- She's nine.
- Does he beat her, too?
Not yet. She takes the baby carriage
out for a stroll when...
When what?
Jørgen is dangerous.
You can't imagine how dangerous.
Wiell, now you know.
Since it's the police asking, yes.
Jørgen has broken arms, legs
and noses all around town.
- Mostly when he's drunk.
- Hasn't anyone filed a report?
Areport? No.
Who'd dare report Jørgen?
- The wife?
- Especially not her.
Does he beat her?
The old marshall thought she
beat herself in order to get attention.
By the way, I received your
medical record from Copenhagen.
I thought you might need
some more pills, just to settle down.
- After that business.
- I've got a handle on it.
- Robert speaking. Skarrild Police.
- Moos here. Where the hell are you?
- I'm on patrol. What's up?
- I caught a shoplifter red-handed.
- Yes?
- Are you corning orwhat?
Mojn.
In here.
Something's been stolen?
- He hid it under his coat.
- Where's the thief?
Get out here.
Here's the culprit. Knud is his name.
- Surname?
- Wie call him Klepto.
- Is this yourfirst offence, Knud?
- Robert, come here.
That's not how we do things.
The old marshall just clipped them
on the ear and sent them on theirway.
- I don't hit children.
- But you'll just get Tønder involved.
Then he'll get an even worse beating
at home, and they won't wear gloves.
Okay, Knud.
I'll let you off with a warning,
but next time you're in for it. Off you go.
- Hello, Marshall.
- Hello.
I hear you've talked to my wife.
I don't know who you are or what
you mean. Just get out of my car.
She showed you her scar.
She cut herself with a broken bottle.
It's your word against hers.
I want you to get out of my car.
Know what this is?
Ingelise with a bread knife.
She hasn't been right in the head
since she had Dorthe. Crazy.
- In that case she needs help.
- I love her. I love her, get it?
And I take care of her
but you're upsetting her.
I'm just doing my job.
You don't understand our ways
even though Moos tried to teach you.
- Right, Knud?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Giving you a hand.
- Don't ever do that again.
You mind your business,
and I'll mind mine.
Hanne speaking... Don't call us.
I just wanted to let you know I'm in
South Jutland. "Mojn" and all that.
I want to talk to Josefine.
- Why?
- I just want to hear hervoice.
Well, you can't.
You'll only rnake hercry. Bye.
It's clear you're not from around here,
the way you hang up your washing.
It's so disorganised.
Look at the neighbour's.
Here, we hang up towels next to towels,
and then trousers-
- and finally socks. In pairs.
- Is that how you do it?
- No, but then I'm from Aabenraa.
There. Now we're like them.
Mr. And Mrs. Normal.
- Why are you spying on me?
- It's purely routine.
- Bored already?
- Just trying to find out what's what.
What are you going to do?
About my life.
- What do you want me to do?
- I told you about my husband.
- You seem happy together.
- It's all an act.
Jørgen puts on an act for the town,
and I for Dorthe.
Let's bide ourtime.
- Until I get beat up again?
- Without a report, I'm helpless.
You need broken limbs or just a black
eye? Or does someone have to die?
No.
That's not by the book.
Fancy some of that, Marshall?
That's the hairdresser.
- Lone TD.
- T's for Thousand. Guess what D's for.
- Got your own hairdresser back home?
- No.
- More into young men, maybe?
- Leave the marshall be.
We've got married women here, too.
Yes, people talk.
How quiet the marshall went
all of a sudden.
- Well, remember who she's married to.
- What are you talking about?
What are you all talking about?
- They're talking about your wife.
- What about Ingelise?
You ought to take better care ofher.
- Yes?
- It's Dr. Zerlang. We've got a problern.
Ingelise came in this morning,
very confused and with a bloody face.
- I've given her a sedative.
- I'll say!
- I just gave her the usual dose.
- It's not the first time?
No, but it's the first time she's refused
to go back to her husband.
What did she say?
People talked at the bar
and Jørgen got jealous.
- You said we had a problem.
- There. What are we going to do?
- Let her sleep it off.
- Not here. I have patients.
- You doped her. Put her on the couch.
- No! Jørgen'll tearthe place apart.
- Then what do you suggest?
- You're the marshall.
Sort out your own mess.
- What happened?
- You know very well what happened.
People talked at the bar.
- Where are we running away to?
- I'm taking you to Tønder.
- I'm not going to Tønder.
- You won't go to Tønder or home.
- Then what?
- You don't get jack shit.
This is all there is.
There's nothing else.
It's all mud, cows...
...and rubber boots.
Take me away from here.
Away from Jørgen.
You need to file a report first,
but I don't know if you're ready for that.
Okay.
I have to call my daughter.
- That was Jørgen.
- And?
What are you doing here anyway?
- Trying to move up the ladder.
- It's a career move then, huh?
- You could say that.
- That's not what I heard.
Some people say
there's something wrong with you.
You got posted here as a punishment.
- It's a punishment to live here?
- Others say you're divorced.
Don't go there.
- They say it's because you're gay.
- I'm not gay.
Can you prove it?
- I've got a daughter.
- What's her name?
- Josefine.
- How old is Josefine supposed to be?
- Almost eight.
- Wie haven't seen much ofher.
No, neither have I.
I haven't seen her in months.
Why not?
- Funny. She thinks I'm in Australia.
- Is that funny?
- Why are you in Australia?
- It was the country furthest away.
Why are you here, Robert?
I did something terrible.
What did you do?
I pulled a gun on my wife.
Why?
Because she was going
to take everything away from me.
- I'd like to go home now.
- Are you leaving?
- What about the report?
- You can forget your fucking report!
What sick game are you playing?
Do you want to get beaten up again?
I want to go home to my daughter.
Let me go!
Skarrild Police.
- So, what got swiped this time?
- Aghettoblaster from the street.
- Great place to put it.
- I put my goods where I like.
Klds need to learn to keep their hands
off. They only learn the hard way.
Come here. The officer wants to know
if you want to get beaten orbusted.
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.
They don't deserve any better.
That'll teach you!
In case you have visitors.
Mojn.
- What's your teddy called?
- Buller.
- What happened to his foot?
- He hurt it.
What's wrong?
Open the door!
It's Jørgen.
Open the door!
- Is my wife here? I want to talk to her.
- No.
- Don't let him in. Hit him!
- Let me in.
- Knock him out!
- God damn it!
How did he look?
I need to talk to her.
Just for a second.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- I just want to see if she's okay.
- She's fine.
- I want to hear it from her.
- How are you?
- Okay...
Mojn.
- Mojn.
- What did you say?
Mojn.
- Do you have any more of those pills?
- What pills?
- The ones we talked about.
- Oh...
Robert, forget Ingelise.
I've barked up that tree, too.
Is it true Jørgen isn't Dorthes father?
- Whoa, where did you hear that?
- I'm the police.
Wiell, he's fathered at least seven
of the other runts running around town.
Seven?
I'm the doctor.
Wie still need a fourth player
for our card game.
No, a beer please.
Well, young Dorthe is taking
the baby carriage for a stroll again.
What did you say?
I said, young Dorthe is taking
the baby carriage for a stroll again.
Ingelise.
- I'm sorry. I'm so dumb in the head.
- There now.
Calm down. It's okay.
You should've taken me
away from here.
I'll take you with me to Copenhagen.
- I want to go to Aabenraa.
- Okay, Aabenraa.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Lie down with me.
Come lie down with me.
I want to feel you.
I want to feel you.
Let me feel you.
Ingelise!
Ingelise!
- Tønder Police.
- I have a confession.
Your name, please?
- Hello?
- It was an accident.
Robert? It's Zerlang.
I'rn calling frorn the rnachine pool.
Get over here. Ingelise is dead.
I'm warning you.
She's not a pretty sight.
- Cause of death?
- Cardiac arrest. And excessive blows.
- Jørgen?
- Who else?
Wiell, what have you got to say
for yourself, Jørgen?
The last time I saw her, she was alive.
I swear.
So she bumped into a door?
Is that why she's such a mess?
What kind ofidiots do you take us for?
- Admit that you hit her.
- Yes, but that never killed herbefore.
The last time I saw her,
she was alive, God damn it.
- How did you find her?
- Dorthe found her.
I want to be with my daughter.
Well, I guess you're going to call
Tønder Police for assistance.
I suppose I'd better.
But it's an open and shut case.
Jørgen more or less confessed.
It's not like you think.
I killed Ingelise.
Nonsense. You may feel guilty,
but that's not the same thing.
You may have caused their argument
but that doesn't make you a murderer.
You never should've invited her home.
That'll come out.
And the fact that you fooled around
and kissed in your garden.
Robert.
It's not in my best interest to have
Tønder Police snooping around.
I prescribed Ingelise
quite a lot of medicine.
I found this on the floor.
Maybe she overdid it.
She's been in Tønder Hospital before,
with an overdose.
I was reprimanded.
- What are you trying to say?
- Let's keep a cool head.
Hold ourhorses, as they say here.
I'll write a death certificate
that won't cause a stir.
I'll just write "cardiac arrest".
That'll do.
- That's not quite by the book, is it?
- No, but it's not a lie, either.
If Jørgen is charged,
we'll both be dragged into it.
There's no need for that,
is there, Robert?
And what about young Dorthe?
Want herto lose both her parents
at the same time?
There's been a...
a tragic accident.
Ingelise Buhl is dead.
Dr. Zerlang has examined her
and concluded -
- that Ingelise Buhl died
from cardiac arrest.
Love brought Ingelise Buhl
to this town years ago.
From the very beginning
she was a strange bird -
- and never quite settled in here with us.
Some of you may say we should
have made her feel more at home.
That we should have helped her.
But it's no secret that
Ingelise had a difficult disposition.
It's hard to help someone
who doesn't want to be helped.
Let's not in our grief
reproach ourselves -
- but take joy in the fact
that Ingelise finally found peace.
The family invites you all
for coffee at the bar.
Let me through.
I propose one minute of silence
in honour of the deceased.
- You'd better keep an eye on Jørgen.
- Why?
People put up with a lot here.
But not a wife-killer.
She died from cardiac arrest.
Take my advice...
If you want Dorthe to keep herfather.
Dorthe!
Dorthe!
Dorthe!
Jørgen!
Jørgen.
Go get him.
I said, go get him.
You're meddling in matters
you don't understand.
You'll pay for this.
Jørgen, get in here.
You shouldn't have done that.
Find Dorthe.
Your boots, Jørgen.
Have any of you seen young Dorthe
since the funeral?
Or do you know where she is?
- I'm sick ofbeing made a fool of.
- Then go back home to Copenhagen.
It won't be long. I'm turning this case
over to Tønder Police.
- Why drag Tønder into it?
- I will, unless you tell me where she is.
Wie don't want anyone from Tønder
snooping around.
- Dorthe can't be alone with Jørgen.
- Jørgen is her father.
Dorthe is afraid of Jørgen.
After all, he did kill her mother.
Says who?
Who says Jørgen killed Ingelise?
And at the end of the day,
who really killed Ingelise?
When Dorthe took the baby carriage
for a stroll, her mother was beaten.
You all knew that.
What did you do? Eco-Tage?
What did you do, Hansi?
What did you do, Helmuth?
You swilled your beer
and let them carry on.
That's the way it works around here.
Everyone knows everything, -
- but no one does anything, and now
that little girl's mother is dead.
Well, if that's how you feel about it...
Wie'll tell you where she is, then.
Open it.
It's the police, Dorthe. Open up.
She asked to stay in there.
Dorthe, it's Robert.
Hi, Dorthe.
What a nice place you've got here.
Dorthe, no matter what people say,
your dad didn't kill your mum.
It was an accident.
Her heart stopped beating.
The doctor says so
and he knows what he's talking about.
I saw you.
You left our house
with blood all overyourface.
- You saw me?
- Don't you remember?
- No.
- You were bleeding from your face.
You passed by me.
You tried to stop him. Didn't you?
- Have you told this to anyone?
- No.
Good.
No matterwhat your dad's done,
he didn't do it on purpose.
He misses your mom
just as much as you do.
Right now he misses you terribly.
I haven't seen my daughter in ages
and I'd be so happy to see her again.
- Where's yourteddy? Buller?
- At home.
You've reached Josefine,
Hanne and Squeaky.
We can't answerthe phone right now.
Leave a rnessage afterthe beep.
Hey Josefine. It's Dad.
I just called to say happy birthday.
I hope you have a wonderful day.
I'm coming back from Australia soon,
so I hope to see you.
I'm really looking forward to it.
You sure have settled in lately.
Mojn.
That's right, I took your boots
with me from the bog.
- Keep them.
- Thanks.
How are you?
Is there anything I can do for you?
I want my name cleared.
I want a fair trial.
- What for?
- Forwhat happened.
Nothing happened. You haven't
been charged with anything.
- Okay, then I want to turn myself in.
- What for?
- That business with Ingelise.
- She died from cardiac arrest.
I'll call Tønder Police myself. Maybe
they can get to the bottom of this.
Stop thinking about yourself. Dorthe
doesn't need a father who's in prison.
- I didn't do it.
- No.
But tell that to Tønder Police.
We handle things ourselves here.
The quack's got some pills
that'll see you through this.
Talk to Dr. Zerlang.
He'll help you.
It's just like the old marshall.
He could put 'em away, too.
Wie thought you were a fag.
But fags don't drink like that.
- You thought he was.
- You thought so too.
- Wie've got new seats.
- I told you you weren't welcome here.
- Why? I pay cash.
- You know very well why.
No.
Go home, Jørgen.
If you throw me out, I demand
that you say out loud what I've done.
What about you, Marshall?
Can you tell me what I've done?
If no one can, I have a right to orderjust
like the rest of these apes. Two beers.
One for me and one for the marshall.
Don't you want it?
Or are you still popping pills?
Dr. Zerlang sure has got
his records straight.
Here's to the marshall
and his good ideas.
Two more.
Here's to Dr. Zerlang.
Two shots.
Two more, please.
Two more.
And anothertwo.
Two more beers.
Dr. Zerlang sure knows where it's at.
Want to talk about Copenhagen?
About the time you came home and
found your wife on top of a colleague?
Wiere you really going to shoot them?
The both of them?
- None of yourbusiness.
- Christ!
Were you going to do it? Huh?
What happened?
Come on.
I don't remember!
You were sent to the nuthouse.
Three months with unsteady nerves.
I've got something for you.
You were there, Robert.
Dorthe cleaned house today and found
this undermy and Ingelise's bed.
Know what she told me?
That she saw you outside our door
with blood all overyourface.
Because you'd beaten Ingelise
half to death.
Wiere you going to fuck her?
Wiere you going to fuck her?
You've got two options.
Either you call Tønder Police
or you and I take a trip to the bog.
And get it over with.
- You forgot one.
- Right. But you haven't got the guts.
- I don't have much of a choice, do I?
- No, you don't.
But Dorthe will be left without a father.
Can you live with that?
I'm sorry, Jørgen, but some say
you aren't her real father.
Know what's good about that?
Hello? It's Dorthe.
My dad hasn't corne horne
and he's not at the bar.
I don't like it here.
One of Eco-Tage's cows sank
into the mud.
Wie hauled it out
but it was a filthy mess.
Wie need to talk.
- Yes?
- Wie'd better go inside.
Can't we talk here?
- Wie'd better go inside.
- I've got a confession to make.
Inside.
What a downpour last night.
The fields will be flooded for weeks.
- Yes, what a downpour.
- You can say that again.
You had a confession to make?
Yes, I... never got around
to writing the reports you asked for.
Never mind. Not much happens
around here, I suppose.
Not more than I can handle.
- You wanted to talk to me?
- You've got a girl who misses her dad.
- Josefine?
- Dorthe.
Her dad's name is Jørgen.
She called us this morning.
- When was the last time you saw him?
- At the bar.
Yesterday at around six or seven.
We had a couple ofbeers
and I went home.
That corroborates my information.
- Did he seem depressed?
- His wife just died. Cardiac arrest.
So I understand.
Chief.
They've found a rubber boot
in the bog.
They're already at it.
I've found something.
This is a goddamned mess.
I've got this sister in Tønder.
She's got a boy. Grown up.
Agood kid
but he got himself in a jam.
Drugs and what have you.
That's who we just hauled up.
He was looking at three years,
but I pulled some strings -
- and set him up
with a bicycle shop in this town.
I never should have done that.
Damn!
But if we say
Jørgen Buhl killed himself, -
- and call it suicide,
we'll close the case here.
- What about your men?
- I don't see any men. Do you?
That's another good thing
about the police.
And you'll be wanting to get
back home to Copenhagen, right?
Hello... Zerlang?
I just stopped by with this guy.
You can dump him in the bog
next to everyone else.
- Mojn, then.
- Fed up with the town already?
I'm back on duty in Copenhagen.
- I thought you'd settled in here.
- Yes, but I've got my daughter there.
- Wiell, that's nice.
- Certainly. If you are going home.
If?
Come on, Robert.
Wie know everything.
- What do you know?
- Wie know you killed Ingelise.
- You didn't mean to, but you did.
- She died from cardiac arrest.
- And you put a bullet in Jørgen's chest.
- Or two, to be precise.
- Wie don't blame you.
- Wie don't miss any of them.
They caused so much tension,
but that tension's gone now.
You're our man now, Robert.
What if I leave anyway?
Certain things about you will get out.
Things that will harm you.
- Especially in Copenhagen.
- So as I said, you're ourman now.
Seven.
Solo.
- Mojn.
- Mojn.
