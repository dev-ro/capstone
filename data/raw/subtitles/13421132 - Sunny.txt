What's your name, Sir?
Sunny.
Isn't Hyatt expensive for quarantine stay?
You are fortunate you can afford it during these times.
The situation is very bad here.
We get rides only once in three days.
Are things any better there, Sir?
Do you have a lighter?
I usually don't allow smoking in this car.
But you may.
How long have you been in Dubai?
Are you doing business there?
Hey, what's this Sir?
Did you come back causing some trouble there?
Don't worry, it's all good.
It's prepaid, Sir.
It's ok, keep it.
When is your quarantine getting over, Sir?
I can give you a drive home.
Hmm..
Sir, you forgot your luggage.
Oh! Yes.
I am going to need it.
Mr. Sunny Varkey.
Yes, we do have your reservation with us.
How would you want to make
the balance payment, Sir?
By cash.
No problem, Sir.
The 4th and 5th floors here are assigned for Quarantine.
Your suite is on the 4th floor.
You will have all what you need in the room for the entire stay.
Under normal circumstances no one will be permitted inside the room.
And of course, you are not allowed to go out of your room too.
Food will be served in disposable containers.
Elevator access will also be restricted.
We are extremely sorry for the inconvenience, Sir.
We hope you have a pleasant stay.
This is your room key.
Thank you for choosing to stay with us.
Thank you.
Sunny.
[Murmuring]
Hello Mr. Rooster!
Stop reminding me of the college days.
I’m a decent family man now.
Is that so!
- Yes.
Leave it..How are you man?
All good..
What's happening with you?
Tremendous job pressure bro.
Company is planning to lay off employees taking
advantage of the current situation.
Need to fight it out somehow.
Tell me this, have you gone crazy..
..to stay in a suite at The Grand Hyatt during your Quarantine?
Did you win a lottery or something?
There’s no need to win a lottery for this.
- Then?
One just needs a heart to live life to the fullest.
Joke!
Do you know which room I’m staying in?
I am listening.
In the same room that A R Rahman once stayed.
So what!
Why’re you coughing?
Are you feeling ok?
Don't worry, I am not infected.
I’m having a drink with boiled water for my cough.
- What?
Do you remember doing the same
in college?
Hmm..
This is not as good, but manageable.
You should try this.
- Hmm..
So then, how’s family,all good?
Deepa's under heavy job pressure as well.
And Appu is fed up with his online classes.
He wants a new laptop.
Says he can't use my old one. Imagine!
Buy him one man!
Or better you do one thing.
Ask Appu which laptop he's looking for.
I will buy him one.
What for!
I am serious.
Place an order immediately.
I'll give money at reception.
Let him have a new one.
Tell me the truth.
Did you hit any jackpot?
Weren't you having a lot of financial problems there?
Yes.
But now, all problems are over.
Everything is resolved now.
How?
I will explain later.
You place the laptop order now..
and forward the receipt to me.
I will settle the payment.
Hmm..we’ll decide that later.
For now, I'll forward a song of yours.
Deepa found it out yesterday.
Do you remember?
It's the song you composed in college for
Nimmi's birthday.
It brought back our college days.
Ok, I'll call you later.
You came to my desert giving me the shadow..
The darkest nights have passed now that you are here..
It is light that I see in you..
All my sorrows have slowly disappeared in you.
As the light I see in your smile..
As the imagery that gets brighter..
As the flower that caresses your face..
You came into my life..
As the most captivating season.
I wish I get lost in your ocean of music..
Come, let's tell the story of our lives to ourselves..
You are my love..
The fragrance that's going to remain forever.
Hello. Who’s this?
Sunny.
Oh, Sunny!
I’m out on a weekend trip.
Can I call you once I get back?
I’m driving now.
Ok, bye.
Hello.
Hello.
Is it Mr. Sunny?
Yes.
Who’s this?
I'm calling from the Kalamassery police station.
Police station?
What’s the problem?
Are you ok?
What do you mean?
Are you having any symptoms?
Oh!, that..
No, I’m okay so far.
Is all this part of police duty now?
Yes.
It is..difficult times!
We’ll inform the health department in case you have any symptoms.
You have any known health issues?
I have low BP.
Are you taking any medication for that?
There’s no medication for low BP.
I’m taking some sedatives for sleep.
Have you reported all this in the
airport declaration form?
Yes.
Please do call me if you feel any health issue.
Ok.
Save this number.
Your name?
I am Sadasivan Nair.
P lease make sure you strictly follow quarantine rules.
All of us are with you, Ok?
Ok, Thank you.
I'll save your number.
Yes?
Good morning, Sir.
Thank you for calling guest services.
How may I assist you?
Yes, Morning.
Double large scotch, whichever brand you’ve got.
Sorry Sir.
But we aren't allowed to serve alcohol in quarantine rooms.
What?
This was already agreed upon before booking the room.
You are right, Sir.
But the other day a guest on quarantine caused some
commotion after drinking.
This decision was taken after that.
That's not acceptable.
You can charge me any amount for this.
But I need a bottle of alcohol.
It's not a matter of money, Sir.
It's a company policy.
Nonsense!
You should’ve told me that.
This is cheating.
Sorry Sir.
Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Bro.
- You're awake so early?
It's not even noon!
Can you arrange me a bottle?
- What!
Or else I'll run away from here.
Bad joke!
The cops will catch you in a flash.
So, beware!
And they'll put you in some government facility.
You'll lose the money paid at the hotel also.
Is that what you want?
Hmm..Aren't you driving?
I will call you later.
Let me see what can be done.
Don't think.
Drop the idea.
Hello.
Hmm..Hello.
Who’s this?
I’m Sunny.
You’d dropped me off at Hyatt yesterday.
Yes, tell me.
Can you could get me a bottle?
Any brand will do.
Hmm..I can arrange a local brand.
Great, that's enough.
Shall I deliver it to your house?
House?
You bring it to the hotel.
I can't deliver to the hotel, Sir.
The cops will catch me.
I can pay.
How much do you need?
Sorry Sir, I’m driving right now.
I'll call you later.
Idiot!
You’re going to die in a car crash!
Hello..
Hello..
Where is this from!
- Hello.
Hello.
Is this yours?
Yes, that's my scarf.
It fell off when I was dancing last night.
Dancing at night?
Yes, that's when I am free.
Were you wearing anklets while dancing yesterday?
Yes, why?
I couldn't sleep last night because of that.
Oh! so sorry, I’m on quarantine here..
..so got some time to brush up my dancing skills.
Ok, are you on quarantine as well?
Yes.
But I am enjoying it here..
Great sights all around.
Hmm..
So, shall I throw this up?
Oh, No!
It will go down!
I’ll inform the front desk.
They will collect it from you.
Ok.
It's time for my office work.
I am currently doing 'work from home'.
Bye.
What a nuisance!!
Oh, Will this ever come to an end!
Pick up the phone, quick.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Sir, I’m Sunny.
We spoke this morning.
What is it Sunny?
Sir..
Tell me.
Sir, are you busy?
Are you feeling uneasy?
Sir, is there a chance to get a bottle of alcohol?
Any brand is ok.
Hello.
If you ever call me again for this,
I'll refer you to medical college.
You can stay there till your results come.
How dare you talk to a police officer like this?
Stupid.
Sir, I’m an Indian citizen.
You can't lock me up like this and
deprive me of my rights.
I will fight for this.
Go ahead and fight then, let me see.
Sir, please..help me..
Sir, I feel restless.
Hmm..
Hello.
Is it that serious?
I am really sorry, Sir.
Hmm..Ok.
I desperately need alcohol.
It's very serious.
Then I will refer you for a consultation.
A doctor will call you in half an hour.
So, I will get alcohol if there is this doctor's prescription?
Hello.
Hello.
Sunny, do you feel like killing someone?
What?
Who are you?
I’m Dr. Erali.
I was asked to give you a call.
Yes, tell me doctor.
Where are you based Sunny?
I was in Dubai.
Were you working there?
No, I was doing business.
What business?
Logistics.
Did your company shut down?
No, I faced an issue with my partner.
So, you came back quitting everything?
Can you help me, Doctor?
I can only help, if I get to know you.
I am Sunny.
There’s nothing more to me.
Do you feel like killing yourself?
How do you know that?
But you’re scared to do it, right?
One need to be brave to die..
..just need be deprived of the urge to live.
Is that what you feel?
I feel all kinds of things.
Then there’s nothing to worry.
This might just be a small withdrawal symptom.
It's not that.
I’m unable to sleep at night.
Hallucination, nightmares..
I feel something happening inside my head.
I’ll tell you a trick that will help you sleep.
While trying to sleep, close your eyes
and try to recollect your childhood..
..your home, dad, mom, school,
fights with your friends, teachers..
Are you done?
Give it a try tonight.
It will not work, Doctor.
Can you arrange me a bottle of alcohol?
Let me wash my hands.
I was having a shawarma.
Is your appetite good?
Yes.
Shall I give you a task?
Is it to bang on plates?
No, it's very simple.
You call someone who's really close to you.
I don't have anyone like that.
Talk to your kids.
You’ll feel much relaxed.
I’m only going to have a kid.
Ok, then call your wife.
I’m divorced.
Oh! So who does the child belong to?
That's mine.
Your life seems a little complicated.
That’s why I told you.
Anyways you call any person you like.
Doctor, that’s not going to work out.
First obey, Ok?
We’ll sort things out.
Don't worry.
I’ll call you back in 10 minutes.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, who's this?
This is the number my father used.
He’s no more.
I am so sorry.
What can I do for you?
Nothing, I just tried to give a call in this number.
That’s ok, no problem.
Whom will I call if there is no one?
My problem won't be solved if I call someone.
You please try to understand?
Are you an artist?
Why?
You don't sound like a boring businessman.
Are you a writer?
- No.
Music.
It's been a long time since I left it.
Understood.
When you couldn't succeed in music,
you left for Dubai..
..there you ventured into logistics business and failed.
Family life strained and ended up in a divorce.
Isn't it correct?
Can you help me, Doctor?
Of course.
I’ll get you something else, not alcohol.
Anything is ok.
I just need to lose my senses.
Don’t worry.
I’ll try if I can arrange it along with lunch.
Thank you.
I won't forget this even after your death!
That's interesting.
Our session will be for 7 days,
until your quarantine is over.
By then, we can solve your issues.
That’s my promise.
Can you send it soon, Doctor?
Ok.
Can’t this guy stop talking and do something!
[Trying to dial a number]
8547..8547
Hello.
- Hello.
Who's this?
We spoke this morning, across the balcony.
No one’s come to collect the scarf.
Oh! yes. Actually, they can't exchange
things between quarantine rooms.
Is it so?
I’m expecting something from outside.
I don't know about that.
They might collect the scarf later.
Ok.
Are you done with work?
No, I just took a small break.
I am bored out of my wits here.
Do you want to come to the balcony?
In this hot sun!
I’ll come in the evening.
Today's sunset will be terrific!
It’s at 06:05pm.
Oh, really?
How do you know?
I know.
Check it out today evening.
Ok.
If you’re busy, please don’t bother.
Yes, I'm very busy.
Busy sitting idle!
Ok.
- Ok then, bye.
Could have asked her if she had some alcohol?
No, good I did not ask.
Hope that doctor sends something good.
Yes, Sir.
Did a doctor call you?
Yes, he’s going to send me something.
- Ok.
I felt he's a very good person.
Don't policemen like to hear good about someone?
[Murmuring]
Yes!!.......[Excited]
Thank you, brother.
Did you get my gift?
What is this, Sir?
I asked you to send me some liquor
and you send me this trash?
This is my medicine for you.
Cyanthillium Cinereum.
What should I do with this?
Your problem is that you have no company there.
And this will keep you engaged.
Yes, right! very good engagement indeed!
Yes, place it where there’s direct sunlight.
Ok Sir, I’ll call you back.
You need to know its benefits.
I’ll call you back,
I’m in the bathroom.
Wonder how he became a doctor!
What should I do with you now?
How is it?
Isn't it terrific?
You’re smart,
What’s your name?
Adithi.
I am Sunny.
Are you married?
No.
Why, what happened?
Nothing specific.
Was in a relationship for a while.
That didn't work out, that's all.
Are you married?
I’m not married.
I’m a bachelor.
Couldn't find a suitable match.
Turned 41 recently.
Hey.
- Yes?
Do you drink?
No, why?
I don't drink as well.
People who don't drink are rare now, so asked.
Yes, yes.
Very rare indeed!
I’m going inside.
The biriyani, I ordered has come.
Biriyani, at this time?
Yes.
Evenings are best to have biriyani!
You have a strange lifestyle!
Well, if you say so.
Ok then, see you later.
Bye.
- Ok.
Guys should never rely on girls to watch sunset together.
They’ll leave you for biriyani!
[Whistling]
Why did he disconnect?
I am in an official call.
I called to see a human face!
Hell, with your official call.
It's a client from UK.
Important call dear.
You watch yourself in the mirror for the time being.
I’ll call you soon.
Don't bother to call back.
Yes.
Hey, can you buy me a bottle?
I’ll give you 10,000 rupees.
Hey, stop. Listen to me.
Hey, stop there.
Idiot!
You also stay in this cage like me.
Hello.
Jacob?
Remember my voice, you scoundrel?
You absconded after cheating me.
I will destroy you, bastard.
I'll tell you a trick that will help you sleep.
While trying to sleep, close your eyes
and try to recollect your childhood.
..your home, dad, mom, school,
fights with your friends, teachers..
Light music, first prize, Sunny Varkey, standard 6B.
Hello.
Good morning, Sir. We have a call for you.
Please hold on while I connect you.
Ok.
Did you think I won’t find you, if you switched off
your mobile and checked into a 5 star hotel?
Jacob.
Yes.
I didn't turn off my mobile.
Then?
It ran out of charge.
I’ve heard a million such excuses!
Why should we fight man?
Just tell me how you’re going to settle the money.
Jacob, I’ll return your money.
When?
Don't you need your original passport?
If you are not coming back..
..I'll start making arrangements for your funeral there.
I am not joking.
I'll return your money for sure.
I did not run away.
I love jokes.
Tell me how you will pay me back?
I've an insurance policy.
I've already assigned it to your company.
What will I do with your insurance policy?
I will get the money only if you die!
That will happen soon.
Oh! tell me when?
- Just wait until then.
Rascal!
Yes, Nimmi?
I want to discuss a few things.
I’m conferencing Rajesh too.
Can we both talk for a moment before that..
Rajesh, can you hear?
I can hear.
Go on.
We need to decide on the flat's ownership.
EMI is still going from my salary account.
Oh, that was pending, isn't it?
It's good if you both talk and settle this.
It's better than getting lawyers involved.
Don't think that I’m demanding ownership of the flat.
That's the only asset I have now.
Can I return your initial investment
of 12 lakhs as part payments?
I don't have enough money
for a one-time settlement.
Is that ok?
Nimmi, Sunny also needs money.
What do you say, Sunny?
Dad gave me that money so I can have a house.
Now I don't need any money.
You can keep the flat.
I don't need any favour.
I’ve sacrificed my whole life for you.
And what have you done for me?
Don't start an argument again.
Arguments will be necessary.
Things need to be settled once and for all.
You haven't lost anything.
You’re still enjoying your life there.
I despise every moment I spent with you.
Tell me..
Sorry, what can I do?
Nimmi asked me to mediate this.
I couldn't say no.
Don't take it badly.
That's ok.
She used to be such a sensitive girl in college!
How efficiently she talks business now!
Myself and Deepa only knows the struggle she
went through after returning from Dubai.
She was rejected for many jobs as she was pregnant.
She is eight months pregnant and still working.
Think about that too.
Well, something positive happened to her, because of me.
That's good.
I’ll call you back later.
We can sit idle for this entire session
if you’re adamant not to talk.
Sunny, you are not alone.
1 out of 10 people in this world go
through different stages of depression.
I’m not depressed.
Very good.
Then what is your problem?
Do you know what happens
when one loses hope, Doctor?
That's what happened to me when I reached Dubai.
I lost my music forever..
And why did I go there?
Only for Nimmi.
But, she couldn't understand me.
What did Nimmi do?
She could have forgiven me.
It's true that I had an affair while in Dubai.
I begged her for apology.
Do you know what she told me then?
That our child she was carrying,
will be ashamed of having a father like this.
She said that on my face.
Then?
Later, I also started feeling that she was right.
Hey..Don't feel that way.
When your child is born,
all these may get resolved.
Bye Doctor.
Mine is a boring story anyway.
Your fate is to stay inside this.
Hello.
Hello, Sunny.
Hope you don't have any symptoms?
No.
You will need to do a PCR test tomorrow.
What happened?
Some of the passengers in
your flight are tested positive.
A health official will be there tomorrow
morning to collect your swab, ok?
Ok.
Paul, there's no need to proceed with Baiju Raghavan's case.
Everything else is lost.
Let this also go.
Why did leave me darling?
You won’t be alone anymore there.
I am coming to you.
Have it.
Sorry.
Hey, there!
Are you trying to kill yourself?
No.
I was trying to check who lives downstairs.
Is this the way to find out who stays downstairs?
You will end up getting thrashed by people.
By the way, you are very cunning.
What happened?
You had told me that you weren't married!
What happened now?
I can see your wedding ring from here very clearly.
Oh! I was only joking.
I’ve seen many like you.
What is your wife doing?
We were in Dubai together.
She's now working in Infopark.
I want your wife's number.
I want to inform about your bachelor life here.
Actually, this is the perfect time for that.
Our divorce procedures are in progress.
Oh!
Did someone come in to collect your swab?
No, they’ll come tomorrow.
What about you?
My test is over.
I’ll get the results tomorrow.
I can leave if it's negative.
Where will you go?
Home, where else!
Where will you go from here?
I don't know.
Sunny, do you smoke?
Yes, at times.
I smoke.
I have 2 more cigarettes with me.
I can give you one.
How will you give it to me?
I can arrange that.
Just give me a minute.
Sunny..
Catch!
Go and smoke up your soul.
Do let me know if you plan to commit suicide again.
I would love to be a witness!
Have fun.
Ok Sunny, bye.
Sir, don't struggle.
You’ll feel a slight irritation, that's all.
Do you have fever?
A small cold since morning.
What is your name?
- Gokul.
Can you open your mouth?
- What?
Please open your mouth.
- Ok.
Put your tongue out.
- Ok.
So, let me make a move now Sir.
Thank you.
Where are you from?
I live nearby.
I am Sunny.
- Ok bye.
Hello.
Hello.
Why did you call?
Didn't we decide not to contact each other?
Well, that night I felt terrible..
felt like I was hallucinating again..
I called to ask what medicine I can take.
Sorry.
Look, I told you, I’ve moved on in life.
So please don't call me again.
Why are you making a big fuss about it?
Who the hell do you think you are!
God!
Why are you losing your temper?
I am not.
I will never ever contact you again.
Hello.
- Hello, Good morning.
Did anyone come to take the
PCR test in the morning?
Are you ok?
Yes, everything went well.
The result will come tomorrow.
If it's negative, you can go home.
Any other issues?
- No
Ok, then.
What is it?
Doctor, I am still hearing sounds.
What should I do?
Are you not feeling well?
Think I have fever.
Oh! It's normal to hear sounds when you have fever.
Don't worry.
Can you send some medicine?
The medicine is there only.
I will tell you how to use it.
Ok.
Just follow my instructions.
Jacob, it's me.
We need to talk.
Don't start blabbering about insurance,
suicide etc all over again.
You tell me what's practical.
I have works to do.
I need some more time.
What for?
Don't you have money to buy poison?
Stop fooling around and tell me when you can pay
back my money with interest?
I’m not joking.
I need to discuss this with my lawyer.
Look, I didn't run away from Dubai.
I came back because of my situation, believe me.
It's ok if you don't have the money..
..don't you own a flat in Kochi?
That's not mine.
Whose is it then?
I have sent you something.
Check your WhatsApp.
Did you see?
My guys went to your flat today.
Your wife wasn't there.
Was she in office?
It's only a two bedroom flat, right?
It's ok, I can adjust with this.
The flat is not mine.
You’re lying again!
Don't you have a share in it?
Register the flat to my name.
I don't think there is another way to solve this.
Shall I talk to your wife about this?
Why should you talk to my wife?
Just for fun.
Anyway, I’ll call you tomorrow.
By then, you better make a decision.
- You are not supposed to be here, Sir.
Please go inside.
- I need a positive response tomorrow..
..otherwise I’m going to look for other options.
- Sorry.
I will call you tomorrow.
Don't you know how crooked,
people like Jacob are?
He is coming to my office tomorrow.
What should I tell him?
You should have consulted
me before creating such debts.
Tell me what can be done now.
Why did you take money from him?
I sold my ancestral home and invested
the whole amount in Baiju's company.
It was Baiju who introduced me to Jacob
when company needed more funds for expansion.
I never imagined I would finally
end up losing everything.
How much do you owe Jacob now?
Around 60 lakhs.
I've already paid lot of interest.
Why did you message me yesterday not
proceed with Baiju's case when you were in so much debt?
Did you get the agreement?
I’m searching..
I think this is it.
Yes, this is it.
I got it.
Good.
Email that to me immediately.
Baiju may have been your childhood buddy..
..but what he did to you is pure cheating.
If I can somehow get back the money invested in
Baiju's company, Jacob's debt can be settled.
That's not going to be easy.
Baiju is not ready for any settlement.
He’s very sure that you won't go to court.
Even if you go to court, it'll take
time to receive the settlement amount.
Then what can we do?
Would Nimmi agree to give away the flat to Jacob?
She doesn't even know about any of this.
Then what can we do?
You tell me.
I don't know.
I will call you back.
Ok, let's see.
Now where will I get
this document scanned!
Hello.
Hello.
It's me, Adithi.
Hey, what's up?
Tell me.
I just called to check if you are still alive.
I was busy with some work.
Oh! is it?
Ok, ok.
My test results came.
It's negative.
Oh! that's great.
I will go home tomorrow.
I called to tell you that.
Hmm..If you also leave,
I'll be bored to death here.
But didn't you say that you
are busy with some work?
This is something else.
A close friend cheated me.
That has now ended up in a case.
Your life is full of happenings!
Actually, what is your job?
Well, It's music.
Here comes another lie.
What's the next one?
Then, let it remain a lie.
What did you do with the cigarette I gave?
I smoked, what else could I do with it?
I shouldn’t have given it to you.
I don't have any more.
Alright then, let me go and pack.
Bye.
Ok.
She and her cigarette!!
She's such a crack!
Doctor, this meditation won't work for me.
Ok, then leave it.
Did you have dinner?
No, What about you?
Today it's special, Mutton biriyani.
You seem to be a foodie like my dad.
Then listen to what your dad says.
Try composing a song today.
That is also a meditation.
That requires inspiration, Doctor.
Compose a song about the daughter
you're going to have, man!
Is there anything more inspiring than that?
I already have a daughter.
You didn't tell me that!
Is she with your wife?
No.
Then, where is she?
She was alive only for an hour after delivery.
I wasn't at the hospital when she was born.
By the time I got there, she was gone.
I returned from Dubai after booking a grave near her..
..to sleep near her.
When did this happen?
When we were staying in Kochi.
We moved to Dubai to distract
ourselves from her thoughts.
And it’s in Dubai, that I had this affair and all.
Sunny, life is like that man.
Think of just one thing, if any more unnecessary
thoughts come to your mind.
You have a deceased daughter..
..and a daughter who's going to be born.
Whom do you want to see?
Decide on that and
everything else will fall in place.
Are you listening?
Yes.
Good night then.
I feel like sleeping.
Ok.
Till the infinite end..
Till the music notes end..
Till the infinite end..
Till the music notes end..
Till the infinite end..
Till the music notes end..
Hello.
Hello, it's me.
I am leaving, ok.
Oh! So early?
Yes.
Ok, Have a great life then.
So, you were not lying when you
said you were a musician?
I heard your new composition last night.
Did you?
- Yes.
How was it?
It's been more than a year
since I composed something.
Hello.
It was just brilliant.
Really?
You’re a great musician, Sunny.
Just don't ever doubt your talent.
There’s only one thing you are missing in life.
Luck.
Just keep working peacefully.
Everything will fall in place when it's time.
I look forward to listening to your music, Sunny.
Bye.
- Bye.
Sir.
Yes, how are you, Sunny?
I am ok.
Sir, when will the test result come?
By evening.
Ok.
Do you require any further counselling?
Is there any problem in continuing?
That doctor is great company.
Actually, Dr.Erali passed away last night.
It was a cardiac arrest.
It seems he was having a lot of health issues.
Fate.
Sunny..
Hello..hello..hello.
Should I refer you to someone else?
Thank you for calling guest services.
How can I assist you?
Why can't you give something tasty to eat?
What happened Sir?
Is there a problem with the food?
This has no smell or taste.
Sorry Sir. Please let us know what you want.
We will prepare it to your taste..
[Murmuring]
Yes, tell me.
One minute.
Did you get the test result?
Can you send me some food from home?
I’m at Nimmi's flat.
Is it ok, if I arrange food when I get back?
You’re at Nimmi's flat?
- Yes.
What’s happening there?
This is a retreat for internal bliss or something.
Nimmi insisted on doing it.
A priest is conducting the ceremony.
What is this retreat for?
It's a ritual to guard the baby in the womb
from the sins of ancestors.
Won't be because of you, don't worry.
It's for the baby anyway.
We came here as Nimmi called.
Oh! ok.
Call you later then.
Fine.
Call you back.
Ok.
Sunny, I’m leaving for the meeting.
-Ok.
The meeting is at 10am.
Jacob and Baiju Raghavan are coming.
Is this going to work?
You haven't done anything wrong.
Then what are you scared of?
Anyway, I need to return Jacob's money.
Both of them have cheated you.
We will teach them a lesson.
And we will do it.
Just do whatever you feel is right.
Baiju has already agreed to return
30% of what he owes you.
Or else he will go to jail.
I am trying to transfer that money
directly to Jacob.
Jacob’s issue will be solved then.
We will make Baiju pay the balance amount as well.
It will take time.
But we will make it happen.
I have only one thing to tell you, Sunny.
Stop running away from life.
Don't be a coward.
Ok.
Be brave.
Paul, I have an urgent call.
Can I call you back?
Hi, how did it go?
Is the function over?
Nimmi suddenly developed pain.
We are at Cochin hospital now.
How?
There’s still weeks left for delivery.
It's a pre-term delivery.
Nimmi is in the labour room now.
Is there anyone for help?
Wont you and Deepa be there?
We all are here.
There’s no need to worry.
I’ll call you, ok?
Do call and let me know.
Yes, I will.
Yes, Sir?
Hi Sunny, your test result has come.
It's positive.
There’s no need to get tensed about it.
Since you have low bp etc..
..it's not safe to stay there any longer.
I have arranged for an ambulance tomorrow morning.
We are going to shift you to the hospital, Ok?
Ok.
Nimmi..
I don't even know if you will open this message.
They are shifting me to a hospital tomorrow.
Even if I recover,
I'll never come to your life and disturb you again.
Like you said earlier..
..you should raise our daughter by yourself.
Bring her up as a beautiful child.
I will watch it from somewhere far.
That's all I need.
I lost you..
..thats my greatest regret Nimmi.
I am really sorry.
I don't want to repeat my mistakes.
Good for her.
Hello.
What happened?
Congrats man!
It's a healthy baby boy.
How is Nimmi?
She is perfectly fine.
It was a normal delivery.
You owe us a big treat.
First get well and come out!
We will then celebrate.
Ok, thank you man.
Hello.
Good morning, Sir.
There's an ambulance waiting for you at the main porch.
Could you check out and please come down?
- Yes, I am coming.
The roads are far..
And you have miles to go.
What's going to travel with you..
Will be life's new challenges.
Hello.
Sunny.
- Yes?
Our son said he wants to see his dad.
You must come, Sunny.
Yes, I will come.
We will be waiting.
The roads are far..
And you have miles to go.
What's going to travel with you..
Will be life's new challenges.
You will come through it..
As the music is back in you.
And a star is leading your way..
As a guardian angel.
Till the infinite end..
Till the music notes end..
Till the infinite end..
Till the music notes end..
