So he snapped and
walked over to his horse,
and got it by the ears, and
said, "Listen, you stupid horse,
bring back a pasi!"
All right, guys, listen up.
Listen up.
As you know
this is the big fish,
this is not
another low level narco bust.
The department has been building
this case for a long time.
Miguel Aguirre,
street name, Hades.
Former member of LA's
18th Street Gang.
Wanted for drug smuggling,
kidnapping, arms dealing.
Basically every flavor
of trafficking in the book,
you name it, he's had a taste.
Two weeks ago, he was
hiding in plain sight downtown,
48 hours ago,
officer Mills undercover
went into the Spring Street
warehouse with him.
Under no circumstances
is Aguirre to be harmed.
Even if he has
a Glock aimed at your head,
- you still take him alive, understood?
- Yes, sir.
This is the first break in the wall
to bring down the scaesa syndicate,
pull this one out and the rest
will come tumbling down.
All right, let's rock this shit.
Green light, people,
green light.
Here we go.
- All good, dawg?
- All good, man.
Just, just nervous.
I had to clear my head up a bit.
Just in time for the party.
Oh, I'm ready for a party.
Come on, man.
The boss is waiting for you.
Absolutely.
Fucking faster!
Everyone's so serious.
The bad guys.
Just playing with you, man.
Here, papi, special friend.
You want to taste?
- No, man.
- Got to stay sharp.
We didn't come here
for this type of business.
Present for you, papito.
You ever danced
with the angel before?
Shit.
- First time for everything, right?
- See? See?
I knew I can count
on my man right here, huh?
- Pop your cherry, old boy!
- Absolutely.
- Holy shit!
- Yeah.
- Come to your mama, papi.
- Get away from me.
Don't blow out that shit, bro.
You got to save it,
for the party later.
I am the motherfucking party.
Fuckers. They'll turn on me
if I don't keep them medicated.
- You're damn right.
- I know you of all people understand how hard it is
to get good help these days.
But this one here, see
the one right there, he's loyal.
Es mi hermano,
my gringo brother, you know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm naming my next son
after him.
- Best gift I can give to anyone, right?
- Yeah.
His name becomes
part of my legacy.
Part of the history books,
right? Ain't that right?
Man, if you ain't got loyalty,
you ain't got nothing.
See? That's what I'm
saying, 100 proof, baby.
- 100 proof.
- Yeah.
Hey. Speaking of history books,
we got to get this deal going.
How much are we talking?
Five billion in product.
That's some pride cheddar, man.
That's
a lot of feria, shit.
It's clean?
Clean and fresh.
Untraceable?
Just got to have the man power to
push it through under the radar.
I got the DEA,
Xander has got the Feds.
If you want my help
I can get the local PD.
Shit.
I didn't
come here to waste time.
Sounds like
we've got a plan then.
Hannah, did you know, if you
touch the G spot and the clit
at the same time, it
takes a screenshot of the pussy?
No, bitch, I didn't know that.
- Come on guys, let's go.
- Let's go.
I'll show you my crotch later.
- Wait, stop! Stop!
- No, fucking go. Let's go!
I said, fucking stop!
What the fuck? What?
Policia!
Policia, man, fucking Five-O!
Motherfuckers
cannot wait two minutes?
Five-O, fucking Five-O, man,
let's go!
Keep on listening
to the musica, hijo.
You don't need
to see any of this.
- Got the routing digits ready, when you are.
- Let's do it.
Yo, Hades, man,
we got Five-O outside.
Fuck you mean?
Outside, the fucking police man!
Go!
We got SWAT outside, man.
- How many?
- I can't tell.
Enough to do some damage though.
Shots fired, shots fired!
All right, lock the place down.
They're about to come in hard.
On the artillery, now!
- On it!
- Move it, boss, upstairs!
Get them out on every window!
Fuck you!
No, this is a mistake,
nobody knew about this!
- What the fuck are we supposed to do with these?
- Protect your investment.
They're here, they're
got to be here by morning.
We don't
give a fuck, let them come.
This is not
what I signed up for.
Clear!
Okay.
Clear!
You fucking bastards!
Shoot to
the right, on the right!
We got a man down!
We got a man down!
Son a bitch.
Go, go, go!
Get down.
Oh, shit!
Motherfuckers!
Fucking bitch, fuck you!
Go!
Son of a bitch.
Clear!
Drop it, Blackjack, drop it!
Cease fire, cease fire!
Put it down!
I knew it, I knew
you were a fucking cop!
Put it down.
No, you son of a bitch!
These motherfuckers!
Clear!
Don't be scared,
what did she tell you?
She tell you
something about me, huh?
Huh? Scared, huh? Huh?
We have a hostage,
we have a hostage!
- Miguel, put him down!
- Yo, you call me Hades, motherfucker.
Fuck that shit,
put the kid down! Put him down!
Check this out, only one way this
shit's going to go down, homie,
I'm going to slice this kid
throat like fucking butter,
that's how this shit
goes down, nigger.
No, it's not, not now.
I'll blow your fucking head off.
Yo, I die, he dies.
Think about it.
Let that shit haunt you.
Yeah, let my face
haunt you, man.
I die, he dies.
I die, he dies.
- I die, he dies.
- Drop it!
Don't make me pull the trigger.
Don't make me kill you.
Yo, I brought
you into my home, man.
I introduced you to
my wife and shit, man.
I was going to name
my son after you, man.
Don't make me kill you!
Homie, you got blood
on you now fucking anyway, here.
Happy? Go die bitch.
Die. Die, motherfucker, die.
That's my kid, man, you think I'm
going to slice my own fucking kid, man?
Nigger, what the fuck?
Oh, look, he's dead,
yeah, go get him.
Go get your bitch boy.
Harry Charles Manson.
Nigger, hey,
who's Charles Manson?
Keep squirming and I'll
have to break both your wrists.
I'm not American citizen,
I'll call Interpol on you.
My lawyers, I'll bankrupt
everyone in your family.
Heard that before.
What is that?
Kid's got an imagination.
Coo Cooi?
What does that mean, Coo Cooi?
I don't really know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You did good, man.
Thanks.
How's Mills?
Bad.
All right,
you guys got to head out.
Whoa, wait, why?
Because they said so.
Oh, they said so, really?
- Are we really going to do this now, sir?
- Yeah, we are.
Look, this is not
the time nor place.
Excuse me, I was shot at today.
Where were you?
Oh, that's right, sitting
behind your fucking desk, right?
Yeah, behind a desk,
doing my job.
Look, I think my friend wants to
know why we have to leave.
Four of these perps were
competing syndicate bosses,
something big was going down,
and the Feds want in.
- You got to be kidding me.
- I wish I was. Look, I'm no happier about this than you.
I want a statement from
everybody as soon as possible,
and forget you were ever here.
A year and a half
of the department's time
and a man in the hospital
and this is how it goes down.
You know I don't
make the rules, Maddox.
Trust me, this is just as
frustrating for us as it is for you.
- It's bullshit. Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.
Cheers, fuckers.
Hey, to kicking ass,
fucking shit up,
and the FBI fucking it
all over in the end.
- And here's to Mills.
- Oh, yeah, to Mills.
To Mills.
And before I forget,
there is a person here,
finding it hard to
give a scumbag like me
the time of day, and
consider a major life change.
Fuck you. Oh!
And then cheers to
modern day social standards,
sexual appropriation despite you
live in the fucking dark ages.
Cheers!
- I love you, homeboy.
- I love you, homegirl.
God, you guys
are too cute.
I need to get vodka
and Red Bull, you got it.
Thanks!
There you go,
whisky on the rocks.
Thanks, Jake.
And of course, guys,
it's on the house.
That's like $10,000 worth of free
drinks you've given us by now.
Well, it seems like
you guys had a rough night.
Yeah, it always is.
Don't worry about the drinks,
shits wearing down anyway.
Shit got real
back there, didn't it?
It sure did, but it always does.
Yeah.
I knew Mills would deliver,
he's a good cop.
He deserves a nice
long vacation after this.
Yeah, he does.
And once he pulls through
he's going to go straight
into witnessed protection.
Like I said,
a nice long vacation.
By the way, I got those...
those papers.
What papers?
Those countersigned
divorce papers,
my wife served me
before I came in today.
Served me
like a goddamn criminal,
not even like her ex husband.
And I already
feel like shit today.
I mean, I really feel like shit.
And you look like shit,
too.
So at least you match.
Thanks for the pick me up, bro.
So, now that
you're officially divorced.
Yeah.
Come here, sweetie.
Welcome back to
the meat market, my friend.
- Hello there.
- Oh, Jesus.
Hi, hello there.
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing just fine.
Don't touch, dude.
Would you like to dance?
Yes, I'm going to arrest you.
- Already?
- Mm-hmm.
What?
You got big hands.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Yes!
Guys. Guys!
Bad news.
What, perp got out already?
No.
Mills didn't make it.
Yeah, that was
the department calling.
Final toast, to brother Mills.
May he rest in peace.
To Mills.
Godspeed, brother.
We've got
seismic activities.
Hey, Vern.
Hey.
Did you tie one on last night?
Yeah.
And you didn't call me?
- I should have.
- You should have.
Well, he's just
finishing up with a patient.
He'll be with you shortly.
- Super.
- Ground reports of unusual weather
in a down weather satellite.
Each which has led to
wild speculation
and conspiracy theories
ranging from fracking accidents
to an alien invasion.
Scientists have
been scratching their heads
over latent
blossoming cloud formations,
which were seen
in the mesosphere,
the region
and the earth's atmosphere...
Sorry, I had an emergency early.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm not going anywhere.
How's work been?
Well, people are
still trying to kill me.
I guess it's too late to tell
you about my malpractice lawsuit.
Sorry, still no sleep?
No. I just can't get used
to being in the house by myself,
you know, I'm just, uh,
just restless.
I mean, if I can work
24-hour shifts, I would.
That's about what
I end up working here.
See, that's the good life.
Good life. See?
Ah. Sorry.
Sorry about that.
So, what's going on, I mean...
Got your blood work results.
Let me guess, too much red meat.
Possibly.
You know, I had a vegan try to
kill me once, still can't do it.
Have a look.
Okay.
I'm not sure
what I'm looking at.
- It's cancer, Vernon.
- What?
Myeloma, it's
a type of blood cancer...
I know what myeloma is.
Luckily it's early,
there are no symptoms yet.
Look, when can
we start treatment?
I'll bring you in
every three or four weeks.
It's... We'll go from there.
- Chances of survival are...
- I know what the prognosis is, and it's bad.
When can we start?
Well, we're not
going to do anything yet.
I would put you on chemo,
but there's only
a very small percentage
of survival rate on that.
I've been studying
this for 20 years and I've had
some fortune with some studies
that were done in China.
What the hell was that?
You tell me, I can't
drive after some tequila,
with this kind of
shit happening on the road?
Shut up, man! I'm getting
tired of your fucking shit.
Hey, Hey. Hey. I'm just saying.
I'm just saying.
Why does all
the crazy shit got to happen
at the end of the shift?
I'm going to call it in.
Dispatch,
this is officer Hanson.
It looks like we got
a weird electrical disturbance
- over by Gates Canyon.
- Copy that officer.
- Check in when you have visual.
- Copy that.
When we have visual?
I think we already have visual.
Seriously, man, we don't got nothing
until something jumps out of this.
I think a fucking lightning
bolt just jumped out at us.
It's two hours before our shift
ends, you're going to start?
Is your blood sugar low
or something?
Look, I had my protein shake
before I came in, all right?
That shit fucks with
your head, you know that, right?
Lovely, lovely, lover's quarrel.
Hey, shut up!
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
That's... unusual.
Seriously?
Dispatch, do you read me?
Do any units out there read me?
This is Hanson.
Jesus.
Your turn?
I don't think
Jesus wants a turn.
Look, I took the last one,
this one... all yours.
All right,
that 70-year old prostitute.
75, and you owe me
big time for that shit.
75 years old. I mean,
that's got to be a record.
Look, when we're done here,
I'm getting another unit
to take this guy.
- Cool, bro, cool.
- Good.
Seriously,
you guys are like the worst cops
in the entire planet, I swear.
Watch yourself.
I think maybe you should
probably go with him, man.
I think you should
hold his hand.
Shut up! Shut up
or I'm going to handcuff you
to a fucking
cactus out here, man.
What in the actual fuck?
Dispatch. This is Hanson,
does anybody read me?
- Fuck!
- Is that the fucking satellite?
I don't fucking know, man,
let's just go!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, man, come on! Get me
out of here! Oh, shit, man!
Get me out of here, man,
come on!
Get these fucking
handcuffs off of me!
Come on! Get me out of here!
...there are no such
things, but something big...
something that made it through
the earth's atmosphere intact
You're late.
I tried calling.
I'll fill you in later.
What's up?
Last minute request
from the Feds.
- Suit up.
- All right.
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, ready to rock and roll, sir.
So this morning threats
came in on Miguel Aguirre's life,
not the typical social media
bullshit, the real deal.
I thought
the Feds were handling that.
Yeah, well, they
specifically requested us
to move him to county and keep
him on a 24-hour watch.
- There's cartel in the county.
- Yeah.
I've got eyes in the sky, boys.
Eyes in the sky.
Keep him in sight.
Hey, hey.
How you been?
Come on, bring it, baby.
You're back in your
fucking element, aren't you?
- Huh?
- I missed you, man.
Yeah, I missed you too.
Nothing like the smell
of middle aged testosterone
in the morning.
Agent Caprice, FBI.
I'm going to be accompanying
you on this little adventure.
I don't think so.
Feds do not ride with us.
Yeah, check in five,
boys, can you confirm that?
So you're the heroes?
Who are you looking for, Mills?
Can't wait to meet him.
I'm sure you can't.
Where is he?
He's in the morgue.
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure that makes him feel much better.
Let's get out of here.
Eyes on the prize, coming out.
Keep the chatter down in
case someone hacks the channel.
Copy that.
Coming in hot.
ETA, five minutes.
Kills my fucking partner
with some... octopus shit.
What the hell?
What is all this?
God.
I don't get it.
What's happening?
Don't they teach you to make
calm in situations like this?
Let's say I had a gun stashed.
Or shit, a grenade.
I pull the pin,
you're going to make calm then?
Or what if my boys offed
another one of you
all like that snitch
motherfucker last night?
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on,
he wants you to do this.
He wants you to do this.
Calm down.
- Calm down.
- Calm the fuck down.
- Easy, come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what I want to see. Yeah, yeah, that's
what I want to see, some real cop shit.
The kind of cop shit
that gets you on the news,
and all over
social media, yeah, yeah.
This just in,
citizens are being advised
to stay in their homes.
What the hell is that?
What is that?
- Can you see it?
- I see it.
You see this
from the office, right?
Hey, look at this!
You're throwing
off my vibes, Coli.
I said, look at this!
Yo what's up, everyone,
it's Dallas.
Coming at you live
from the heart of Los Angeles.
I'm going to take you guys
to the walk of fame,
the Hollywood sign
and my personal favorite,
last but not least,
Vivid entertain...
And also, an alien invasion.
Oh, shit!
Guys, I'm getting some
interference with the radio.
What the fuck happened?
Shh!
Cartel's got
anti-aircraft weapons now?
Buddies of yours?
Boom.
No. Fuck, I missed my pudding.
- Oh, what the hell, assholes?
- I'm sorry.
You're very sorry,
you son of a bitch.
Hey, hey, let me in!
No, no, no, no.
Drive, drive!
Go, go, go, go, go!
- Who are you?
- Hey, just drive! Drive!
- Lady, get out of my car.
- I'm going to push you right into traffic if you don't drive.
- I think you better do what she says, man.
- Go!
Okay, fine! Fine!
Just drive!
Motherfucker!
Dammit, no, no, no!
- What is it?
- The van's dead.
- What do you mean the van's dead?
- It's dead.
Well, make it undead then.
I'm trying.
You
don't know how to drive.
Oh! Stop hitting me.
Stop hitting me, lady.
- You're going to get us killed.
- First of all, that thing's what's going to get us killed.
Jesus Christ. Shit. Shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Stop cursing,
it's fucking judgment day.
Dammit, hold on
to something and pray.
Come on, man, you've got it.
Come on, you've got this.
It's been a good life.
I'm coming, Rito,
I'm coming up to see you, Rito.
Not today, Satan. Not today.
What the hell are you doing?
Atul? Atul!
Shit.
What the fuck happened?
I don't know.
Everyone all right?
Yeah, anybody hurt?
Just my feelings.
Cargo good?
I'm going on, baby.
Yeah, whatever.
Any idea what happened?
Someone had to have hit us.
If they did it wasn't
explosives, something else.
Snipers maybe,
blew out the tires?
No, the choppers
would have seen it.
I'm pretty sure
the chopper went down.
No signal. Anybody else?
I got nothing.
911's down too.
Shit.
Fuck!
You want it? Come on!
What the hell is going on?
Oh, shit, man.
The tires are intact.
The snipers maybe?
No. It's not a bullet wound.
Hey, man, you can't help
a brother out?
What?
A tooth.
You know what? I think I'm going
to start calling you tooth fairy.
Yeah.
How's that for
a motherfucking tooth fairy?
This doesn't make sense.
If someone's trying to take us down,
then what happened to everything else?
No, I don't think
this was planned.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Holy Mary Mother of God.
What?
Up, man. Look up.
That's no cartel.
No, it's not.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go, we got to move.
Come on!
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go!
Come on.
It's four blocks to the county,
and we're going to hotfoot it over there,
- come on.
- What the fuck is that?
The hell does it
look like, homeboy?
Come on, people, we got to move!
Hey, we got to help
these people though, right?
There's no time, we got to go.
Left! Left! Left!
Move!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Move!
Run, run!
Go, go, go, go!
Pick it up! Come on, go.
- They're catching up!
- Come on! Go, go!
- Come on!
- Bullets aren't doing anything.
Pick it up!
Hustle, hustle, come on!
Go, go, go, go!
SWAT, SWAT, SWAT, SWAT!
Go, go, go!
It's locked.
You're going to let them in?
No, let them figure it out
for themselves.
All right, back it up.
They could have just knocked.
- Clear!
- Go, go, go!
Get in here.
- Whoa!
- Fuck!
- Shit!
- Ah!
- Oh, my God!
- I got you. I got you.
- I fucking got you.
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Don't let go.
No!
Fuck.
Jesus Christ!
Fuck, what the hell is that?
- It looks like my mother's vagina.
- Shut up!
The fuck?
Close that goddamn thing out.
What the fuck is that thing?
What the fuck are you?
It does kind of look like vivid.
Just like Vivid.
You think
this is a joke, huh?
You think it's funny? People are
dying out there, you understand?
- Okay, I understand.
- What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is going on here?
Fucking serpent.
You saw that thing
in the sky, right?
That's impossible.
You saw it
just like I did.
That's fucking impossible!
You saw what happened, man!
Fucking aliens!
Actual fucking aliens, man.
That's right,
that's what's in the sky.
Knocked out cell towers
and broadcast capabilities.
Yeah, they knocked out cars too.
We closed the doors
so we didn't get mobbed.
Is this the only
civilian you let in?
Jesus.
You didn't let any more in?
- No. Yup.
- That's it?
Hendrix here is
a little bit anxious.
So, you brought the delivery.
Yeah.
Put him in a cell.
The rest of this place
is like a bank vault,
but we got to figure out how
to seal off these front doors.
People, listen.
I know we got hit hard,
but we need to be ready
in case more of these things
show up, got it?
- Got it.
- Yeah, I got it.
So what's your story?
I'm a tourist.
You got any training?
I got second place in
a Street Fighter tournament.
So you're good with hand to
hand, how about firearms,
any weapons?
I didn't place in
a Mortal Combat tournament.
Wait, what?
Oh, you mean in person,
like for real?
I took Taekwondo in elementary
school, if that counts.
Everyone took Taekwondo
in elementary.
So you're worthless.
I'm a podcaster from Texas.
It's not
a real fucking job.
Anyway, Let's drop the cargo,
come on. Let's go.
Fresh meat.
Fresh meat!
Fresh meat!
Fresh meat!
Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
Let us
the fuck out of here!
Oh, here to
keep me company, huh?
Open number three.
Cartel in here won't
let your boy sit easy.
He's not ours,
he's property of the FBI.
Prisoners know what's going on?
As far as they know,
its an earthquake.
We tell them what's out there
and they might get
real Catholic real fast.
I prefer them
the way they are now.
I'm Catholic.
Nobody's perfect.
Home, sweet home.
I heard Mills
played you really good.
Hey, you know what? Do you...
Hey, Miguel,
do you like... coloring books?
The fuck you mean
coloring books?
You know, coloring books.
We were at your house...
cleaning the mess up and...
the girl's kid
was drawing a picture...
it kind of looked
like that thing back there.
It said Coo Cooi.
- Coo Cooi?
- Coo Cooi.
I know the neighborhood
kids use it,
around Halloween,
that name, it means a monster.
You know what, man,
it's funny, man, life's funny.
I thought I was the monster.
I don't know shit.
Yeah, I kind of figured that.
Always a pleasure.
Let's go.
You got an analog radio
or ham radio, anything?
None that are working.
My comadre can fix it.
Be my guest.
I don't think radio shack's open
if she needs any parts.
She'll be fine.
What the fuck's going
on outside there, pigs, huh?
Sounds like
a building going down.
It might be safer outside.
Let's move.
You feel safe? Let me
out of here, I'll skull fuck
every goddamn one
of you with a baseball bat!
Can you do me too?
Can you do me too, bro?
Move it along motherfucker!
I'll take a baseball bat
and shove it up your ass!
Kentucky style.
Bitch!
You like that shit, huh?
Let me
the fuck out of here!
Huh?
You like that? You hear me?
You good, man?
You want to know if he's good?
He said something was up?
Yeah, I don't know
if now's a good time.
Is it the ex wife?
I, I went to the... doctor's
to get the results
of my physical this morning.
I have cancer.
You're kidding me.
Shit, Vernon.
Yeah, it's, uh...
myeloma. It's a, it's a...
blood cancer.
The survival rate is not good.
I don't know what to say.
You know what, brother,
you don't have to say anything.
I mean, it's, uh,
it's my reward for...
for a lifetime
in public service.
Okay, we got to get you out
of here, we got to do something.
You know what, let's just keep
it between our selves right now,
I don't want
anyone else to know.
I'll tell them when
the time's right, all right?
Absolutely.
Of course.
Thank you.
- That's all we got.
- All right. I don't know the last time
anybody used these.
That is not a fucking joystick.
All right, we got two riot guns.
We've got, uh, four
or five Glocks, extra clips,
flume grenade, got some knives,
we got some tear gas,
and every coed's favorite...
pepper spray.
I'm not sure that
will be too effective.
You know what,
you don't know until you try.
Yeah. Right.
Agreed.
Totally agree.
So is this all we got?
This is a jail house,
not a police armory.
You have
cartel in here.
It's
not our decision, man.
We don't run the city.
You may need the assist
if one of them
manages to break out.
We don't want cartel to get
any heavy artillery,
now do we?
It's like he said,
it's not our decision.
Way above our pay grade, bro.
How's everyone ammo?
Not good, wasted bullets
on those things getting in here.
Down a clip and a half.
Hopefully these knives
can do some damage.
We just got to make
sure every shot counts.
That's going to be hard
to do when we don't really know
what we're dealing with,
and our numbers are down.
And in a place full of people
who don't want us here.
I'm sure if we stay in here
long enough, they'll get in.
We need to move
on to something else.
That's why I want
to get that radio fixed.
- Can I get you on that, comadre?
- Definitely.
C-Los, Kai,
let's get you two on the roof.
See what the damage
is outside these walls,
and we can
figure out our next move.
- Affirmative.
- Copy that.
Lee, go with them.
They can't cover
the whole roof alone.
No problem.
Thank you.
What about me? I'm useful.
Why don't you go play
some fucking Punch-Out!!?
Punch-Out!!
I love Punch-Out!! My Ninja.
No. Just no.
All right, people,
let's move.
- Let's go.
- Put all that ammo in that bag.
Yes, sir.
How does it look?
I don't know.
I got to check it out first.
Well, let me know.
Hey.
Hey.
I know it's tough,
but we got to keep moving
until we get a handle on this.
Tobias was like
family to me too.
But we got to keep
that mourning in check.
Yeah.
He was my dip shit
little brother.
I'll miss him.
Yeah, me too.
I'm going to go back downstairs.
No, you're not.
Your boss gave you orders.
You're one of us now. Cool?
Yeah.
I'm cool.
Good.
Shit.
All right, all right.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Fuck, yes.
Oh, I still got it.
If anyone
can hear me out there...
this is officer Hannah Paulson,
we're in the county jail.
We have few survivors,
and we're low on ammo.
If anybody can hear me, we'll sure
as shit be grateful for the help.
So we just sit here
and watch the world burn.
It's not in my DNA.
Not in mine either,
but now we just got to sit tight
and survive.
Guys. Guys.
The situation is
apocalyptical out here, fellas.
Stay safe down there.
Jesus shown up yet?
Nada de nada, señor.
We got fires all around.
There's fires all around?
There's no way out.
- At least not by ground.
- Jeez.
All right.
Well, stay safe out there.
I might
be ready to pray.
Okay, so here's plan B.
Communications and transportation
are both knocked out.
What's the goal?
It's the end of the world?
No.
It's psychological warfare.
Paranoia, desperation.
Right. People are
strapped to their phones nowadays.
Take them away and they panic, they
don't know a world without them anymore.
Yeah, like I said,
the end of the world.
- Agreed.
- See? she gets it.
So what's the end game?
They're watching us.
Yeah, but what's
going on in their heads?
Weakness,
vulnerability, desperation.
They're exposing our handicap.
Exactly that. Finally
you say something useful.
Before cell phones
and the internet,
people were generally more self
sufficient, something's broke you fix it.
No phone,
you knock on someone's door.
They're going to sweep this
building if they haven't already.
- We need to be mobile, and not just for your sake.
- Right.
What's so special about him?
We just got to go.
All right, look, I see that I'm
not your favorite person here,
and for the record,
I'm not disagreeing with you.
But none of the vehicles work.
You know what, we find out more
about what
we're fighting against.
And how do you
suppose we do that?
The cargo.
- Cargo?
- Yeah.
Yup.
What, you don't
think I look sexy?
You remind me of that
greasy looking sasquatch,
that booked me, boy.
I told you earlier,
I don't have shit to say to you.
I just came by just to...
say hi.
- Did you miss me?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I missed you too.
You know what, boys,
this guy's about ready to snitch...
and I know how
you boys love snitches.
You recognize this fool?
I recognize him.
The fuck you want?
Coo Cooi.
I told you before, I don't
know shit about no Coo Cooi.
Yeah, you do.
You know maybe I can
have these boys here,
come in there
and jog your memory.
We need to do
it this right here?
Absolutely not.
You guys hear that?
Yeah, we got ears, don't we?
I can pick each one
of them all from up here,
if I had a .50 cal.
Yeah. One shot
from that .50 cal,
and there'll be on you like ants
on high fructose corn syrup.
At least I'd have done my part.
Anyone got a book?
I can use a massage if you
feel like that'll help out...
with time.
I don't think you're my type.
You got a type
during the apocalypse?
Yeah, not alien.
Well, I guess
that makes me alien then.
Yo, they need to
stand so close to me?
Making me uncomfortable.
Got to compare ink,
you're a fan?
I know I'm comfortable.
You boss?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You seen these things before?
No.
Heard of them though.
Enlighten us.
It was one of those stories
that used to scare little kids.
When I was a boy in Baja,
my abuelo
told me a story
about his grandfather.
How he used to
trade with the settlers.
I don't recall
seeing this on any map.
You could have said
something before the ambush.
Something's different here.
I can feel it.
This place is empty.
It looks like somebody
left in a great big hurry.
What's that supposed to mean?
- It means they were running for their damn lives.
- Quite.
I know the heat is getting
to you, but this is enough.
- Quiet.
- Stop!
One day he came to them...
and the entire
settlement was dead.
- Go, go, go!
- James!
Go, go! Don't you
take my brother!
Come on!
No, I love you.
Bodies were there but...
they had all the blood
taken from them.
"Vampiros del cielo,"
he called them.
The vampires from the sky.
Space vampires?
That's the stupidest
shit I've ever heard.
Yo, I didn't
come up with the name.
I know it sounds
fucking ridiculous to you,
but that's what they are.
They're here for blood.
Hijo de puta!
What the fuck are you?
It's pierde mierda.
Mierda.
Oh, shit!
Get the fuck off my planet.
So how did they beat them?
Never did.
My abuel said they went
from settlement to settlement,
they come in, take the blood,
destroy the town
then split the next day.
What do they use the blood for?
It's their medicine.
Take him back to his cell.
- Oh, it's like that, huh?
- Yeah, it's going to be like that.
Put your gun
down now, drop the gun!
Hey, hey!
Yeah, you.
Shut up, man, shut up.
Shut up! Shut up!
Pussy ass,
cosplay gothic motherfucker.
Shut up, man!
Shut the hell up.
I got a costume in here.
Sexy little nurse's outfit,
want to see?
Shut up, man, shut up!
Get me the fuck out of here!
The fuck's wrong with you?
It's okay, it's okay.
No!
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.
C-Los.
C-Los. Kai?
They're all gone, chief.
I see a light.
They're coming.
They're coming here. Goddammit,
and we're sitting ducks.
Then we make ourselves scarce.
Wait a minute, there's
a tunnel in the basement.
It goes under the street to
the precinct on the next block.
How do we get there?
Through the cell block,
so we're screwed either way.
You got to be
fucking kidding me.
Get over here.
Here you go, brother.
- New plan.
- What?
I stay here and you go.
No, I... I can't do that.
I'm not going to
make it out of this room.
I don't want to slow you down.
- Hey.
- What?
You go get yourself well.
I got this.
I know you do.
I know you got it.
I know you do.
Paulson,
Officer Paulson,
you there?
This is Sergeant Solon
at Nellis Air Force Base,
people alive down there?
Gone, everyone...
Oh, shit.
Solon, this is
officer Hannah Paulson, LAPD.
Sergeant Solon.
Sergeant Solon?
Yo, yo!
Yo!
Took you long enough, man.
Took you long enough to find me.
Holy shit, well, you're real.
I know who you are.
You ain't no Coo Cooi.
You're my father, huh?
Yeah.
What's up, Dad?
What's up, Dad?
You did this, right?
You made me like this, right?
You're a bad ass, man?
You ain't shit, bro.
I'm worse than you.
I'm worse than you.
Come on Dad, you
killed me a long time ago, Dad.
It's good to see you again, Dad.
It's good to see you again, Dad!
Solon. Solon?
- Can you send someone for us?
- Hannah. Hannah.
We got to go. We got to go.
I got someone
on the radio.
It's the military.
He said everyone's gone.
Yeah, right.
Hey, look.
You came in here with us,
now you're one of us.
Let's get out of here, come on.
Paulson, you there?
Hey, get anything
useful from Aguirre?
It's
an old Mexican legend.
They're here
for a blood harvest.
They use human blood
for medicine.
The tunnels aren't far,
two lefts and a right.
A blood harvest?
Where's the rest of the team?
They're gone.
They're all gone.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Come on!
What the...
Get behind me.
Stay close.
Shit, shit, shit, shit!
Hadouken!
Come on!
Come on. Come and get it.
Come here, you fuck!
Come on!
Shit. What is that?
What the hell it that? Ah!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
What the fuck do you want?
You want blood,
you want what's inside me?
Huh?
Take it.
Take it!
Holy shit.
Let's move.
There's nothing we can do here.
If the precinct's clear,
we can get some ammo,
supplies, whatever
we need to keep moving.
Slinging over a mule here.
Wait, there's animals down here?
Did he say anything
about everybody being gone?
The signal was bad,
I don't know what he meant.
If it was just
the base or... worse.
Assume worse.
It's the end of the world, duh.
He said something about
a helicopter,
but he didn't say when or where.
Probably scanning
the area for survivors.
Assuming it's safe,
I say we get to the roof.
Lights some flares,
just in case.
Can you help me?
Can you help me?
Come here. It's okay.
Here you go.
Lie down.
That's bad.
I'm not going to make it, am I?
I'm sorry.
One thing...
before you go...
can you help me with the pain?
Yeah.
I can, uh...
I can...
I can make it stop.
I promise.
I promise.
I hope that was him.
Vernon?
Vernon?
Any survivors?
No.
I'm sorry.
Regular rounds won't hurt them.
What will?
Hollow points.
Yeah. Yeah, you're on fire.
Fucking nuclear.
Let's give it a try.
God, I feel old.
That's not my problem.
I'm young... ish.
I mean, I couldn't have come down
here, when I was like... 20.
- Enjoying your vacation?
- This fucking sucks,
I was supposed to see
the Hollywood sign today.
You're safer in here, trust me.
Hey, buddy, if
we make it out of here...
I'll take you there myself.
That'll be cool.
If it's still there.
Wait a second.
It found us.
Can this thing go
any fucking faster?
It's here!
It's here.
Fuck!
What the fuck is that? Shit!
- I'm out.
- You're out?
Re-load.
Back.
What the...
Ah!
I got your backs!
I got your backs!
Told you I can be helpful.
You are one of us.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Where the hell is it?
- Fuck!
- Come on!
Cover me.
Come on. Come on,
get me. Get me.
Come on!
Do it! Do it!
Come on.
Kill me, you motherfucker!
Come on!
Huh? What's wrong?
Yeah!
Come on!
Come on! Come and get it.
You ugly green,
fucking son of a bitch, come on!
Come on!
Go ahead. Go ahead.
What, you know
what's wrong with me? Huh?
I'll tell you, I'm dying.
I'm dying.
You don't like that, do you?
You don't want to take me?
I'll take you.
Go ahead!
Go ahead!
Come on!
Hey, fuck face.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know.
Shit.
Vernon?
Vernon!
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
We got to get you out of here.
No, you're not going to do that.
It's bad.
It's bad.
Look.
Stay strong, all right?
Don't forget about the team.
I won't.
You know what?
Cancer...
it's a son of a bitch.
There we go.
She's awake.
Jesus Christ.
That bad?
Yeah.
Sergeant Solon.
That's right.
You must have circled
the city a dozen times.
Are there any other survivors?
Just him there.
Got him wandering the streets.
Damn near dead.
I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
Only because we
got you out in time.
But I did make it. I'm alive.
Where are we?
Over the Arizona desert,
we're out to Camp Navajo.
So you know
what happened, right?
You know what
happened to the city.
Same thing happened
in San Francisco...
Seattle...
most of the Western seaboard.
I was in San Diego
before I was...
We found a few others
on the radio.
But you two are the only ones
that have survived.
Everyone else is gone.
The government's
considering an air strike,
whether there's
survivors or not.
- An air strike, are you serious?
- Yes.
Come on, man. A nuclear war
is not going to solve anything.
So it really is the harvest.
Yes.
So you know about the legend?
It's been
classified for decades.
Great.
Anything else useful
still classified?
Like what?
Like how we fight them?
No.
There's your weapon.
What is it?
It's a form of blood cancer.
Cancer?
Yeah.
Welcome to the resistance.
