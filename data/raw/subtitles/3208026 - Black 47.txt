Alright.
Come on then.
No excuse tonight.
It was your accomplices.
I have no accomplices.
Oh.
I found the guns.
If you don't cooperate,
they'll charge you with treason.
And I have no interest
in seeing you
punished unnecessarily.
I sympathize
with the Young Irelanders.
No, you don't.
You're a puppet of the crown.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
A subject.
Loyal subject.
So feck off
back home to England then.
I prefer here, Mr. McCormack,
I find it challenging.
There's no place now
that you get someone
to tell the truth.
Or does England
not want you anymore?
Accomplices?
Well, inspector
has the prisoner been
cooperative?
Not really. No.
He's dead.
In the year of 1845
a terrible famine
descended upon Ireland.
Within a few short years
one in four of our people
would be gone forever.
Fled to England
and North America.
Or dead from starvation
and fever.
Irishmen who had enlisted
to fight
for the occupying British crown
in its foreign wars
returned home to find
only death and destruction
in every corner of the land.
Seen by many as traitors
to their own people
they looked on helplessly
as their country
continued to choke
under the rule
of the British Empire.
Beartla O'Naughton.
Martin O'Feeney.
Where's my family?
I'm sorry, Martin
your mother died a year ago.
Sick with the fever.
Where's my brother?
Hanged.
Stabbed the bailiff
when they came
to tumble the house.
I couldn't help them.
I had nothing.
This is the final order
to vacate!
This dwelling
will be rendered uninhabitable.
We are taking the roof off!
For your own safety,
come out now!
Are you comin' out?
Sergeant.
What's your business here?
Tell your men
to get off the roof.
I'll pay whatever is owed.
Not a question of money.
The tenancy is illegal.
They moved in
from the side of the road.
Move back, please.
At least let them leave
peacefully.
How does this concern you?
Let me talk to them.
I won't ask you again.
Stand down
and let this men do their job.
Take that young man
into custody.
You little thief.
No!
Michael!
Michael!
Get him out of here.
That's his rifle.
Here's his boots
and his other stuff.
Breach of the peace.
Interfering constabulary
business.
Sergeant says
find out who he is
and where he got the weapons.
Name?
Name?
Go on, say it.
Well, he can speak English,
alright.
Army musket.
Could be a deserter.
Huh?
Where'd you get this then?
The prisoner's lose!
Get back down here!
The prisoner..
What's going on down there?
Drop him!
Drop him!
Put him down!
No, please.
Inspector Hannah.
What would you say
to a stay of execution?
We've received reports
of a deadly attack
on a Constabulary station
in Connemara.
On the estate
of Lord Kilmichael.
We believe this man,
originally from the area
may have been involved.
One of our Connaught rangers.
Declared absent without leave
in Calcutta three months ago
after breaking
his commanding officer's jaw.
I understand that you know him.
That you served together
in Afghanistan.
That he is an effective soldier.
He is.
You'll be released
to accompany Captain Pope
to Ballybrack and to assist him
in locating
this Corporal Feeney.
I'm retired
from military service.
Yeah, but you must agree
that your particular expertise
is better suited
to this line of work.
I do not agree.
Might I remind you, inspector
that you're no longer
the decorated veteran
the hero of the rank and file.
You're an ineffective policeman.
An embarrassment
to the Irish constabulary.
A hero who is about to be tried
for the murder
of the suspect McCormack
for which you may be hanged.
So think carefully.
Are you agreeable?
Remove the inspector's
restraints.
Find this man.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, it is yourself.
I'm glad to see they let you go.
Will you have a drop?
You will.
To your poor mother.
God have mercy on her.
She was a stubborn woman
who'd rather starve
than take the soup.
What could I do about that?
"Just take it," I said to her.
"Say what they want you to say."
But she wouldn't.
They'd torn
the roof off the house.
I thought it better
to put an animal in it
than to leave it idle.
You know, your mother
was a cousin of mine
better to keep it in the family
then let strangers get it.
Much better.
The judge,
who hanged my brother..
...what was his name?
Bolton.
I'd give anything
to have them all back.
Your mother, my brother.
Michael.
But I can't.
Damp day.
You should have kept
your powder dry.
How far do you plan
to travel, captain?
As far as we need to.
I'm compiling a report
on the economics of famine
in the west.
Wexford Independent.
Here.
Free copy.
"Galatians" chapter six,
verse seven.
I beg your pardon.
"For whatsoever a man soweth
that shall he also reap."
Drunkenness and fecklessness
is the economics of famine
in the west.
And the continued crop failure.
Failures, sir, lies
in the character of people.
Explain your total
dependence upon the easiest
grown staple learned to mankind.
Potato was the only way to feed
so many over limited acreage.
Food for the contented slave
not the hardy and the brave.
Ho-ho-ho,
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh-shh-shh.
These will do fine.
Thank you, lieutenant.
Private, take Inspector Hannah
to the stables.
Give him
whichever mount he chooses.
Yes, sir.
This way, inspector.
So, that's the Hunter Hannah.
In the flesh.
Well, you need that kind of
steel where you're going.
They say you're after a ranger
who's taken up
with the Ribbonmen.
I do not engage
in idle gossip, lieutenant.
Nor should you.
Have the horses ready at dawn
and your man
in plain clothes.
We don't want to attract
any unnecessary attention
do we?
Horik O'Se..
...you stand accused
of stealing a sheep
from the estate
of Lord Kilmichael.
What say you?
English is the language
of this court, Mr. O'Se.
How do you plead?
Silence.
Your Honor, the man was only
trying to feed his children.
He doesn't even speak English
and it is the
legal obligation of the court
to pay for a translator.
Where is the translator?
Inability is one thing,
this man's obstinate refusal
to speak a language
he clearly understand
is another entirely.
You leave me
no option, Mr. O'Se.
I find you guilty as charged
and I hereby sentence you
to six month hard labor
followed by transportation..
...to Port, to Port Arthur,
Van Diemen's Land
seven years.
Remove the prisoner.
State your business.
You hanged my brother?
I did nothing of the sort.
If I did pass sentence
on this brother of yours
I simply assessed the evidence
and interpreted the law
the constabulary hanged him.
Indeed some might say
that he hanged himself
the day he choose
to commit his crime.
Some might.
I understand
that may further bolster
your sense of injustice
to blame me
for your brother's demise.
But I do not cause
the crops to fail
and I am not responsible
for people breaking the law.
I'm merely a servant
of the court.
I bid you good day.
Good mornin', sir.
Uh-huh.
What do you think you're doing?
Private Hobbs
is coming with us
to serve as my orderly.
And to tend to the horses.
Time to earn that reprieve,
inspector.
Who do you think
responsible, sergeant?
Same Ribbonmen who burned down
the constabulary station
and killed six of my men.
A magistrate will be
a typical target
for these Ribbonmen.
What brings you here,
gentlemen?
We're compiling a report.
May I enquire as the nature
of this report?
You may not.
Was this Feeney?
There was no robbery.
Private, get outside
and keep watch.
What does this mean?
What was this man's name?
What's this man's name?
They don't have the English.
Do you know
what happened here?
Be quiet.
Well?
Well?
The body belongs
to Beartla O'Naughton.
Rent collector
for Lord Kilmichael.
Somebody came into his house
and killed him.
An unexpected end
for the pig
but he'll be ate all the same.
We're looking
for the Feeney house.
There's the rest of him?
He took over this holding
when Mrs. Feeney was evicted.
He learned that
from the Ghilzai.
Afghanistan.
I've not yet had the privilege
of foreign service
Well that's their punishment..
...for treachery.
What happened to Mrs. Feeney?
Without food or shelter..
...she died.
He's headed west.
I suppose we continue west.
You'll need a translator.
How much?
How much have you?
You should inform
the constabulary.
Our orders are clear, inspector
we will not involve
local authorities.
Well, that was before
we confirmed his identity
we tell the police
we prevent him killing again.
Confirming Feeney as the killer
does not complete our work.
As you well know.
♪ Rock of ages ♪
♪ Cleft for me ♪
♪ Let me hide ♪
♪ Myself in thee ♪♪
Time to welcome our new members
who we look forward to seeing
every Sunday at service in town.
What is your name, my child?
Seamus O'Suilleabhan.
James Sullivan.
James Sullivan, do you renounce
the Roman Catholic Church?
Do you wish
to have your soul cleansed?
Have you made Jesus Christ
Lord of your life?
We do not eat until
service is concluded.
We nourish the soul
before we satisfy the flesh.
It is not yet time to eat.
You leave it any longer,
they'll all be dead.
God's work comes first.
No, Papists.
Here.
Is it true what they said?
About your prisoner?
I killed him, yeah.
You were just doin' your job.
Catch this man
keep your pension..
Fuckin' deserters.
Cowards.
No, it's not always cowardice
that makes men run.
You know, they get tired..
...angry.
All they need is a home.
Sometimes
you can talk to 'em..
...bring 'em back.
One of them even saved my life.
He pulled me out
of an ambush.
Just outside of Kabul.
I thought I was finished.
He was the
best soldier I ever met.
He never fought
for the queen though
just for his mates.
Fucking Irish.

There's a lot of tracks.
He could've gone either way.
Probably best to hold
our course.
Two hours ride up that road
is the house of a Mr. Cronin.
Cronin evicted Feeney's mother.
And a few days ago,
did the same thing
to the brother's wife
and children.
He's Lord Kilmichael's
land agent.
Cronin?
Fine.

Where are the men?
They went to the stables.
I'll fetch them.
No, I'll get them.
What's the hold-up?
Who are you?
What do you want?
What? The harvest?
I'm only an agent.
For Lord Kilmichael.
It's his land.
It's his grain.
I have money.
Can I help ye, gentlemen?
We're looking for Mr. Cronin.
The master's not here, sir.
He left for town
only a few moments ago.
We didn't pass him
on the road.
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Just take the horse.
Fire!
For God's sake, man, shoot him!
You bloody idiot!
You had him!
Dammit!
No.
We will continue
to the police station in Carrick
and send a dispatch rider
to warn Lord Kilmichael
that his life's
in imminent danger.
Orders or not,
I cannot allow the murder
of a nobleman
for lack of a warning.
Send one of Cronin's servants
to Carrick
we'll stay on Feeney's trial.
- Where does Kilmichael live?
- London.
But when he is here,
the estate house.
About days ride from here.
Let's go straight
to Kilmichael's.
You're in no fit state,
Mr. Hannah.
I'll be the judge of that.
Ah, Mr. Quinlivin.
I wonder if it might be terrible
inconvenience to you
if we borrowed
one of Mr. Cronin's horses.
I'm afraid that would be
quite impossible, captain.
Well, you see, you see...
I doubt
that Mr. Cronin's family
would condone
of my supporting the men
who failed to warn them
that their husband and father
was the target of a madman.
Good day to you.
They sent you to get rid of me?
Yeah.
They can't afford to have
one of their own
someone they called a hero
turn against them.
They never called me a hero.
Only you.
I was just your faithful Mick.
I was sorry they chose
to see it that way.
We did things for them
that cannot be forgiven.
And for what,
when I come home to this?
If I kill a man,
they call it murder.
If they do it,
they call it war.
Providence..
...justice.
Where will my family
get their justice..
...if not from me?
Go home, English.
You've got no business here.
I won't be leaving here
without you.
Then you won't leave at all.
What is all this?
Kilmichael's put 50 guineas
on Feeney's head.
Is every half-wit
in Ireland here?
No, sir.
Your mother went home yesterday.
Home to London.
Your Lordship, Captain Pope
of the 68th regiment.
Your Lordship, I'm Captain Pope.
I was sent here...
His Lordship knows full well
who you are, captain.
What he does not know
is whether this report
you've been compiling
will detail how you endangered
his life withholding
vital information as you did.
Sir, you are in grave danger.
We've managed this estate
for 200 years.
Do you think
this is the first time
our lives have been threatened?
This is different.
I have no intention of allowing
some turncoat renegade ranger
to dictate my itinerary.
I have a dozen men
to protect Lord Kilmichael.
Poorly trained police
are no match for this soldier.
Another two dozen local militia.
And who do they fight for?
They fight for the bounty
I've put on this ranger's head.
We'll proceed as planned.
I'll accompany the grain
to town
and from there,
take the train to Dublin.
You may join me if you wish.
Excuse me.
Sorry, pardon me.
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.
What's goin' on, mate?
Just scavengers,
they go after the wagons.
Hopin' for a bit of grain.
Oh, where are they
taking the grain?
People are starving here.
Boat to England.
I think we are headed back
to town, Mr. Conneely.
Thanks for your help.
The captain will pay you
what you're owed.
If it is all the same to
yourself, Your Honor.
I'd rather see it out.
Why settle for a sovereign
when there's a share
of 50 guineas to be had.
I beg your pardon, captain,
but after all this trouble
I'd like to witness this
tale's conclusion first-hand
that it might be accurately
retold in the future.
You better come quick!
- Drop your weapon!
- Open the gates.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Drop your weapon,
or you will be shot.
Hobson, what the hell
are you doing?
I can't have it, sir.
Look at all those people, look.
They're fuckin' starvin'.
Put down your gun!
This is your last warning.
Everyone's dyin' of hunger
and they're porting food
on a boat.
Open the gates now.
Private, lower your weapon.
Not till we feed these people.
Court martial me, sir.
Do whatever you want with me
but not till those people
are fed.
Please, son, put down the gun.
And I don't give a damn what you
think about either, Mr. Hannah.
This is pointless,
it won't change anything.
It will.
I can help these people.
Sorry about your man, sergeant.
I was talking to him!
The boy lost his mind.
You couldn't keep him
in check
so Sergeant Fitzgibbon did.
He was a danger to us all.
He shot an unarmed constable.
I only followed
His Lordship's orders.
That seems accurate.
Well, then, captain,
any sign of our assassin?
If not,
does this mean I wonder
that you've lost your man and
that your mission is a failure?
When I inherited
this estate from my father
it was practically bankrupt.
To clear the land
was the only solution.
Consolidate the holdings,
graze not grow
reduce this ridiculous tax
that I must pay per occupant.
I don't need them, I don't want
them, why should I pay for them?
This potato business is
simplified matters considerably.
There are those who look forward
to the day
when a Celtic Irishman
is as rare in Ireland
as a Red Indian in Manhattan.
I take no pleasure on it.
Would you stop worrying, man?
There's hardly a soldier alive
who could get close enough
to get a shot through this gap.
Security is assured.
The farmer goes into the bath
and he sees the old squire
straddling his eldest daughter.
Well, he's furious
and he lets out a shout..
"For God sake, Mary!
"Arch your back like a good gal
and keep the gentleman's balls
out of the muck."
Everything's in, My Lord.
We'll lock up the exits,
and I'll see you in the morning.
Thank you, sergeant.
You know, Conneely..
...I love this country.
What's left of it?
The scenery.
You peasants are all the same,
no appreciation of beauty.
Beauty would be held
in much higher regard, sir
if it could be eaten.
Well said.
I say one more, shall we?
That we shall, sir.
Speaking of beauty
this one could
almost be English.
- Uh..
- Hair!
Her skin, fine bosom
certainly head
and shoulders above
any of the miserable hags
on the estate.
Take the prettiest
English maiden..
...put her for one season
in an Irish cabin..
Yes?
Feed her water and potato,
dress her in rags
and make her wade through bogs
and sleep with the family pig.
Take from her any hope
that the future
will be different
and when she crawls
out of her hovel
stretching out her scrawny hand
for a penny..
...how much will she look like
that pretty English maiden?
One might be inclined
to speculate
that you've lost your passion
for this mission, inspector.
Hmm.
I still have a few ideas about
how to apprehend Feeney..
...but I need to know
you're with me.
Yeah.
Time to turn in.
I got you, you bastard.
Aah!
Hey!
Well done, Hannah.
Let him have it.
Shoot him, inspector.
Aah! Get your hands off of me!
Shoot the bastard!
Aah!
Shite.
Do you intend to try to teach me
some sort of lesson?
Or to torture me?
I assure you I'll give you
no satisfaction.
I won't beg.
What do you say?
I don't understand
that aboriginal nonsense.
Speak English, man!
Speak English!
I'll rip your goddamn
throat off.
Who is he working with?
Don't bother threatening him,
sergeant.
Mr. Hannah doesn't have
anything left to lose.
Now that he's committed
a treasonous act.
How long have you been
working together?
Since the beginning?
Where is he now?
Shall I get the whip?
He won't talk.
He's out there somewhere,
and we have to find him quickly.
Each of you, take four men
from outside the gates.
Search the area.
Run!
Make ready!
Present!
Take cover!
Ahh!
Sergeant!
Who's firing on you?
The man on the roof
in the west, sir!
You men, with me.
Hey!
It's Feeney.
It's Feeney!
Open fire!
Who gets the 50 guineas?
Hold those men back!
- Close those gates.
- Close the gate!
Reload your weapons.
Where is Mr. Hannah?
Secure the prisoner.
He's here!
Hey, ho-ho.
They'll come for you now.
Yeah.
Don't fight them.
Go to America.
