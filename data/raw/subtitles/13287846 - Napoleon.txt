Get back, you lot.
{\an8}Get to the guillotine.
{\an8}The scourge of France!
Terror is nothing
more than justice.
Prompt, severe, inflexible.
It is therefore an
emanation of virtue.
Now, she was guilty of
three charges against you:
depletion of the
national treasury,
conspiracy against the internal
and external security of state,
and high treason for acting
in the interests of the enemy.
Mercy for the villains?
No.
Mercy for the innocent.
Mercy for the unfortunate.
Mercy for humanity.
An inescapable outcome
of democracy's connection
{\an8}in relation to the nation's
immediate demands at this moment...
{\an8}The British navy have
taken the port of Toulon.
{\an8}Half the French fleet
is trapped there.
If we lose those ships,
the Republic will fall.
Lucky for us, there are only
2,000 English troops in Toulon.
But we are short of artillery and led
by a general who was a court painter.
It is not necessary to
recapture Toulon itself.
The town is not a town.
The town is a port.
If the harbor's untenable
to the English fleet,
the town must surrender.
My brother, Captain Bonaparte,
as artillery officer,
has organized heated shots
against English ships.
He has proven his
commitment to the Republic.
And how do you propose
to take the harbor?
Capture the fort that
dominates the harbor,
and you have the city.
We must make an example,
or other cities will fall.
And I, for one,
will never let the royalists
or the English take my region.
{\an8}Morning, sir.
{\an8}General Carteaux?
He's over there.
Lucien, my dear brother,
I am in Toulon already.
The troops are in a poor state, and your
conscripts untrained and undisciplined.
Without equipment and
resources, I see only failure.
We are collecting scrap iron to recast
small mortars more suitable for my plan.
If we do not succeed,
those in power will only see us as
Corsican ruffians unfit for higher office,
and our mother's
ambitions will be quashed.
That's it, madam.
Fine eye you have.
- There you go.
- I'll still be here next week.
The British control the big guns that
point out at their fleet offshore.
Take those guns, and we can fire
onto them and end this blockade.
Surprise is my advantage,
but I will win by fire.
I cannot wait for your arrival.
Your brother, Napoleon.
Oi, shit rag! Yes, you!
Move along now. Go on. Move!
Move them fucking goats!
Last chance! Fucking
move them goats!
You better fucking
move them now!
Do you understand?
He sat himself down
by the fire, my boys
To join in our jovial crew
- Get in position.
- Quick!
By the chimney corner
was his own place
Where he could sit
and dye his old face
When Jones's ale
was new, my boys
Quick, quick!
When Jones's ale was new
Pints of beer and bottles of sherry
To help them over the hill so merry
When Jones's ale was new
Fire!
We're under attack!
We're under attack!
Grab your weapons!
Get those ladders up quick, men!
Fire! Hit your target!
Get the mortars up there!
Ready, boy?
Oh, God!
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Get the mortars!
Protect the cannons!
Into position!
- Vive la France!
- Vive la France!
Ready the cannons!
Sir! Yes, sir.
Mortars!
Elevation 160.
- Fire!
- Firing!
Junot, heated shots!
Fire!
Junot, fire!
Fire!
- Reload!
- Reload.
Fire!
Shoulder, hold!
Captain Napoleon Bonaparte, I award
you the rank of brigadier general.
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!
I promised you brilliant
successes, and I've kept my word.
Order, hold!
For Mother.
The current leadership of France
has passed from enthusiasm
to reckless ambition.
And the public perception of the
guillotine is lawless passion,
led by Robespierre.
He is unfit to rule.
Bonaparte.
France!
It has become increasingly
clear, Citizen Robespierre,
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!
Let me speak!
There is no man in this room
who has objected to my methods.
If you say I am guilty,
you are all guilty!
You are not a
defender of freedom.
You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?
You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!
You are, all of
you, the traitors!
Arrest him!
Get him.
You missed.
The guillotine, my friend.
A seven, madame.
Deal again.
Deal again.
Your bet.
Seven again.
No. No win.
I'll be out first. That's mine.
Why are you staring at me?
Am I?
- No, I was not.
- Yes.
You weren't?
I was.
I was staring at your face.
What is this
costume you have on?
This is my uniform.
I led the French
victory at Toulon.
Do not tell me your name.
General?
There is a very young man
who wishes to see you.
His name is Eugène Beauharnais.
Citizen.
General Bonaparte.
Yes?
My name is Eugène Beauharnais,
son of Joséphine Beauharnais.
What do you want?
My father's saber.
It was taken from him before
he was arrested and executed.
Yes?
It would mean a great deal to me and
to my mother if it were returned to us.
It's all we have of him.
The sword is a weapon.
I cannot allow citizens to have
weapons in their possession.
The sword is a keepsake for me
to remember my dear late father.
Perhaps, but it is a
weapon nevertheless.
Young man, why are you here?
My mother said that you were the only
man of authority to retrieve the sword.
All of these are from officers
who were sentenced to die.
Did no one think to attach
names to any of them?
No, there are no names.
General Bonaparte?
Thank you.
Is there reason to
introduce myself?
No, General.
Good.
My compliments to the
chef of this fine family.
Would you like to sit closer?
Do I look like I'm in love?
Do you find him without appeal?
No.
Then perhaps that is enough.
Do not underestimate your grace.
When you look at me, do
you see an aristocrat?
No.
My husband had more
than one lover.
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.
When I was in prison, I was told the
only way to survive was to get pregnant.
So, General...
do I need warn you
of my indiscretions?
No, madame.
Does where I have
been concern you?
No, madame.
If you look down,
you'll see a surprise.
And once you see it,
you will always want it.
People of France, don't be
fooled. There are more of us!
We can occupy this Convention!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
No doubt you've seen the
chaos in the streets.
Yes.
There is a belief
amongst the Committee
that there is an attack on the
Council coming by this mob.
I have less than 4,000 troops and
very little in the way of weapons.
There are 40 cannons in Sablons. I
could have them here in three hours.
This mob is 20,000 strong.
Yes.
As my second-in-command,
what would you intend to do
if this assignment of defense
was transferred to you?
I accept, on the condition that
I command this as I see fit.
Without interruption.
I will not lead as
second-in-command.
{\an8}Come on!
Fire!
According to the law of
20th September, 1792,
Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher,
born 23rd June,
1767, in Martinique,
accepts as her husband
Napoleon Bonaparte,
born February, 1768,
in Ajaccio, Corsica.
Do you consent?
- Yes.
- I do.
Do you consent?
Yes. I do.
I declare you
united in marriage.
To the savior of the Republic!
And to Madam Bonaparte.
To Madam Bonaparte.
This guy right next to me?
He wants my saber.
Let that good work
make us a son.
Dear Joséphine,
{\an8}I follow in the footsteps of
Alexander the Great and Caesar,
{\an8}as I have been sent
to liberate Egypt.
I have 40,000 men,
and the sights are wondrous,
and the weather is stifling hot.
I have already conquered Italy,
who surrendered without conflict.
The Directory has approved
my plan for attacking England
through their eastern empire.
But my achievements seem
slight, as they keep us apart.
Dear wife,
This love I have for
you is a kind of death.
There is no survival
for me except in you.
Hello again.
What are you doing?
No letters from you.
Good morning, Lucille.
If you loved me, you'd
write me twice a day.
Tell me there are no
snakes in your bed,
in your legs,
inside what is mine.
You must write me and tell me
that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,
that only you can please me.
Are there limits to
what I can tell you?
There shouldn't be.
Should I tell you something at the
risk of giving you personal pain?
Yes.
Your wife has taken a lover
named Hippolyte Charles.
- You expect me to believe this?
- Yes.
That my wife would
do this to me?
Yes.
No dessert for
you. You may leave.
I would never lie to you.
How do you know this?
Lucille is my lover.
She writes to me.
Joséphine's lady-in-waiting
is your lover?
Prepare two frigates and two smaller
vessels in the greatest secrecy.
I'm returning home.
Napoleon,
this will be seen as desertion.
General Kléber will be informed of his
succession in command after I've left.
Napoleon the victorious!
Where's my wife?
She has left to
greet you in Lyon.
Do not lie to me.
Where is my wife?
She left earlier today, General.
- Lyon?
- Yes, sir.
The entire world knows of
my arrival, but not my wife?
What kind of creature are you?
How could you care so little
for me and my feelings?
You are a selfish little pig.
Do you think so lowly of me?
No. I don't.
Then why?
Because you're what? Say it.
I'm sorry.
That's not enough.
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say
that I am the most important
thing in the world!
You are.
- Say it!
- You're...
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world. You a...
- And without me, you are nothing.
- I'm nothing.
And you will do anything!
I'll do anything.
I'm not built like other men.
And I'm not subject
to petty insecurity.
You're a beast.
I feel sorry for you.
You want to be great?
You are nothing without me.
Say it.
Say it.
You are just a brute that
is nothing without me.
I am just a brute that
is nothing without you.
Yes.
You are nothing without
me or your mother.
My mother...
Did you have affairs?
Of course I did.
And did you love them?
No. No, I did not.
Were they pretty?
Yes, some of them.
They served their purpose.
More than I do?
They cried less. That
made them more attractive.
Don't...
Don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me.
Just don't leave me.
You don't have to forgive me. Just
promise me you won't leave again.
What is it that made you
desert your troops in Egypt?
Citizens...
what country are we in?
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.
Who should be responsible for
her governance while I'm away?
Because it is not
you, Citizen Gohier.
It is not you.
It certainly is not you. Although
you're very good at scowling.
It is not you, Barras.
Or you, Talleyrand.
Or you, Sieyès.
So, who?
Who should be responsible?
Fouché, do you have any ideas?
No?
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.
Printing money that
is spent within hours,
the Austro-Russian
overrun of Italy,
the Anglo-Russian
occupation of Holland,
and what appears to be the imminent
invasion of France herself.
And yet, you accuse
me of desertion.
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.
What do you want?
Well...
the people would accept my
rule if I have your support.
Like you, though, I believe
that the Directory is corrupt.
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy,
and we can preserve the
ideals of the Revolution.
And I think that a seizure
of power is possible
with your help,
at the right time.
And I think this
is the right time.
So, you expect me
to be your sword?
I expect that a coup d'état,
well-timed, well-executed...
could transfer power into
the hands of three consuls:
myself, Ducos...
and you.
I'm inviting you to
the winning side.
It's a simple letter of
resignation we would like you to...
I am not signing anything.
You can piss before
I sign anything away!
Gentlemen.
Who's doing this?
Good morning, Paul.
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.
I have documents announcing your
resignation from the Council.
You must retire before you
have your breakfast, please.
Tell them I return with joy to
the ranks of simple citizen.
I shall.
There are some gentlemen
here to see you.
Citizen Moulins, we have a letter
of resignation for you to sign.
- No. I am eating my breakfast.
- No.
I am enjoying a
succulent breakfast.
This is outrageous! I shall finish
my breakfast before you touch me!
- No!
- Enjoy your breakfast.
Director!
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.
Hear, hear!
This emergency session is to
draw a list of nominations
for a new Directory to
deal with the threat...
the threat of the royalists.
We are being asked
to pass a resolution
forming a provisional
government to three councils:
General Bonaparte and Citizen
Sieyès and Roger Ducos.
Where are the five
members of the Directory?
Have they magically disappeared?
And we are here, surrounded by
troops, isolated far from Paris.
Order!
This is becoming
increasingly clear:
that your brother,
Napoleon Bonaparte,
with his show of military
might, is acting as an outlaw.
I vow to solve this matter.
And that this is a ridiculous
and poorly executed takeover.
A power-hungry upstart.
Enough!
If there is any question of what
is happening here, I will answer!
How dare you!
This is... You have
violated the constitution!
- You have...
- Hold him!
Get him!
- Arrest him!
- Stop him!
Oh, fuck!
Kill him!
Let me through!
Right.
We are being terrorized by
deputies armed with daggers!
And these madmen have
outlawed themselves
by their attempt on the
liberty of this country!
- They're trying to kill me!
- They're trying to kill him.
Open these doors!
Let us out of here!
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people!
Get in there now!
Fuck.
Move. Get back. Back.
Move it!
- Back. Move back.
- Move back. Out of the way.
Move. Backwards.
Good luck, brother.
Stand aside.
Shall we vote?
Where are we going?
All our harsh words
are behind us.
I need you to be my
most tender friend.
Over this door is our destiny.
Present arms!
- First Consul.
- My lord.
Milady.
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- First Consul.
- Citizen Bonaparte.
First Consul.
Come, little one.
You get into the bed
of your master's.
Hello, madame!
Hello, good evening.
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.
It's good to meet you.
Could this be Joséphine?
- Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
- Good to see you.
It's Charles.
This way.
"Your Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity."
Let me try again.
Your Royal Majesty,
England and France
- are wasting their prosperity...
- Your Majesty.
What did I say?
"Your Royal Majesty."
"Your Royal Ma"...
Your Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity.
I am not ashamed to
take the initiative.
I have, I think, sufficiently
proven to the whole world
that I do not fear
the chances of war.
But peace is my heartfelt
wish for England and France.
Read it back to me.
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,
I have addressed letters to
all diplomatic agents abroad,
{\an8}and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.
{\an8}Caulaincourt.
What I need from you is
a better understanding
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.
Would you consider the tsar
an ally to England or France?
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him
than his trade with France.
And do you have a sense of British
influence in the Russian courts?
I do not, but I imagine
it is quite robust.
Robust?
What kind of man is
he? Describe him.
Well, he's young.
He's vain.
He's popular, and he
wishes to remain so.
He's popular?
Really?
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.
So he needs an ally that
he can also call a friend.
No more bets.
What a surprise.
How nice to see you out.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Good evening. I'm just
trying to lose some money.
Well, after this hand, why
don't you come and join me?
I'm at my usual table.
That's a lovely idea.
Good evening.
Did you hear?
Your Majesty received a letter of
peace from the First Consul today.
Monsieur Talleyrand,
if I may be honest?
Of course.
Austria's coalition with England is in
such a strong position against France,
that these peace
overtures are clearly
only for your handling
of French public opinion.
Oh, my friend.
You know me so well.
Yes, it is true. It is public
opinion Napoleon is after.
But my warning to you is
that he's as hungry for it
as any man in the
history of the world.
So my suggestion, with respect,
would be to take this little
offering of peace from him...
or suffer the consequences from
a man bent on peace at any cost.
The English ambassador, Lord
Whitworth, has arrived, Consul.
Do not look at me as if you
don't know what I'm about to say.
Are you aware of my letter
of peace to your king?
I am not.
Shall I repeat it?
No, you may not.
Take this as a
warning to your king.
I will keep you
guessing and scared.
You will watch your
borders and your back,
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.
I will offer no more
letters of peace,
and I will take the lack of a swift
reply as an act of disrespect!
You think you're so great
because you have boats!
'Tis a shame such a great
man should have no manners.
Yes?
Are you pleased?
Are you about to tell me
something that will make me angry?
Let's hope not.
The European families think nothing
more of you than a Corsican thug.
Therefore,
I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.
I suggest that you abandon your
role as First Consul of France
in exchange for the title
"Victorious Consul."
By another name, "king."
What?
"King."
Yes, king.
King?
My hair has been set.
The way you like it.
Oh, you filthy man. My
hair has been set now.
I have the most beautiful wife.
I... All right, come on then.
Hat off.
Give me your hand.
- You feel that?
- What?
Can you feel that?
That's yours.
It's yours.
Thank you.
Stop.
Why aren't you pregnant?
Is that a question, or
is that an accusation?
It was a question.
Now it's an accusation.
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart,
and he has no answer.
Only that I do what Madame
de Rémusat has done.
Which is?
Which is...
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,
he suggested I take the
waters at Aix-la-Chapelle.
And why haven't you?
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.
I spend many hours
cleaning up after you.
Find the time.
I don't need to explain to you
the importance of this, do I?
What, you want an heir?
I want one now.
Oh, my God.
May God affirm
you on his throne,
and Christ give you to rule
with him in his eternal kingdom.
I found the crown of
France in the gutter.
I picked it up with the tip
of my sword and cleaned it...
and place it atop my own head.
The most glorious, the
most august Napoleon,
emperor of the French,
is crowned and enthroned!
Long live the emperor!
Long live the emperor!
I do not support this idea.
You suggest divorce
after years of debate.
You can see that
it has me divided.
I am not ambitious.
I've never declared
war with anyone.
No.
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world
and the world's only
chance at peace.
The security of the empire and peace
in the world depends upon an heir.
It was an option.
And I said it at the time.
Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm going to war to
defend our people,
and my wife cannot
provide me an heir.
If you do not bear
me a child tonight,
there will be a divorce.
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.
Yes, there has.
There have been
years of it. Years.
And with more than just me.
And still you are empty.
And you're fat.
I enjoy my meals. I do.
Destiny has brought me here.
Destiny has brought
me this lamb chop.
Joséphine.
Come then.
Come.
I love your talents
and your taste.
And while I'm away, I
will miss your grace.
And your dignity.
And I will come back to you.
To today's victory.
Look, I'm always here
for you, Francis.
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed with
the excitement of the battlefield.
{\an8}I should not deceive
you, Alexander.
{\an8}This battle against him will
be brutal and terrifying.
Come on!
Get in defensive position!
My good wife, Joséphine.
My God, it's cold here.
I miss your warmth.
On this day, we celebrate the first
anniversary of our coronation.
My previous ally has now
joined with my enemy.
The Russian Tsar Alexander joined
forces with the prince of Austria.
I have heard that he's been
studying the art of war
and trying to emulate
my battle tactics.
More fires.
He tries to copy me,
but he is a little boy who
will make a terrible mistake.
I am certain I will bring the laurels of
another glorious victory to my army today.
Yours, Napoleon.
Hey, tie it from the back.
Peg that corner to the ground.
That's it.
Fuck.
Your Majesty.
We are discovered.
Good.
Tell the men to rest.
I-N-F-S.
Infantry sighted.
I-M-T.
Imminent!
Stand to!
- Stand to!
- Stand to!
- Stand to!
- Stand to.
- Wake up, men. Get ready!
- Stand to!
Come on, get up!
Wait.
Ready!
Wait! Let them think they
have the higher ground.
Fire!
Fire away!
Fire at will!
Send in the infantry.
Take their position on the
higher ground. At the double.
Take the ground!
Cavalry from the west.
Pierce their flanks.
Retreat! Withdraw!
Withdraw!
It's a trap!
Retreat!
- Uncover the cannons.
- Cannons!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Reloading!
Keep to the one side.
Off the ice!
Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.
Off the ice! Withdraw!
Cut off their retreat.
Francis. So nice to
finally meet you.
Please come in where it's warm.
- Thank you.
- You must forgive me.
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.
Seems very agreeable. You
make excellent use of it.
Well, we do what we
can on the battlefield.
Yes, we do, don't we?
It's nice to finally
meet another emperor.
Where, may I ask, is Alexander?
Are we waiting for his
arrival before we get started?
I do not believe he
will be joining us.
He's beside himself with rage.
I realize I must compliment you for
making me commit an enormous error.
- An error?
- Yes.
What error have you made?
To be speaking with you here and
accepting this invitation for peace,
I have not followed
up my victory.
I could have taken the whole
Russian and Austrian army prisoners.
Yes.
But after all, there
will be less tears.
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?
Thank you.
Toast?
To friendship, a glorious peace
and the best interest of Europe.
Burgundy.
Hold on. Hey, whoa!
Whoa, we don't say woof. Okay.
That's my boy. Attaboy.
Come here. Sit.
It is time to put this
mystery to rest, Emperor.
I want to know if
it's you or Joséphine.
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.
At the end of the
hallway... Take this...
Waiting for you, undressed,
ready to receive,
is 18-year-old Eléonore
Denuelle de La Plaigne.
She's brunette with brown eyes.
And the object of this, well,
hardly unpleasant task is to
see if you can father a child.
And then we will have an
answer to this nagging question
of who is keeping who from an
heir to the throne of France.
Shall we go?
May I have another, please?
The girl is pregnant.
You made her pregnant.
I know I didn't see her.
When are you going
to insist we divorce?
Isn't that wonderful?
From the only woman that I've ever
loved and given all that I've conquered.
I'm just too tired to wait for you
to tell me what I know is coming.
If you insist.
I'll make it easy for you.
I know you will have
a bastard child.
If I succeed in making the birth of
a boy that I shall call my own son,
I want you as a witness to pretend
the confinement of the empress.
Your Highness,
you are asking me to lie about the
status of the mother of your heir.
That is another way
of putting it, yes.
Emperor, it is my honor
and my duty, of course,
to do as you require of me.
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.
And painful though it is,
the truth is that the empress is no
longer capable of bearing you a child.
My good Joséphine.
You know how I've loved you.
It is you, to you alone,
that I owe the few moments of
happiness I have known in this world.
My destiny is more
powerful than my will.
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.
The imperial decree for the
dissolution of the marriage
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,
would be given to my children.
However, I have lost hope of
having children from my marriage
to my beloved wife,
Empress Joséphine.
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the state
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."
You have embellished
my life for 15 years.
The memories of which will remain
forever etched in my heart.
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.
She has been deprived of
one day being governed
by the descendants of the man
brought to us by providence
to mend the evils of
a terrible revolution
and restore faith, the
throne and the social order."
Sorry.
- Emperor. Wait.
- Go. No, listen. All right?
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?
Now say it.
Say it.
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.
Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,
as I must, does not
change my feelings.
The emperor will have in me
always his truest friend."
Emperor,
you have just pronounced the
word which separates us forever.
{\an8}Your mistaken
ambition has ever been
{\an8}and will continue to be the
guide of all your actions.
Nevertheless,
you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.
May it at least afford me some
consolation for my sufferings.
- Yours, Joséphine.
- Thank you.
- Good morning, madame.
- Thank you. What's your name?
- Fleur.
- Fleur. Pleasure.
I miss you.
Marital life is
very agreeable now.
You've shown such
great courage so far.
You must maintain it.
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.
You look best when you're happy.
Please take care of your health.
It is precious to me.
Will you write me tomorrow?
And the next day?
Yes.
And the day after that?
- And the day after that?
- Yeah.
Good.
{\an8}Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.
{\an8}He said, "You French,
you fight only for money,
while we English,
we fight for honor."
I replied, "Everyone
fights for what they lack."
This is not your story. This
never happened to you, did it?
Of course it did.
- Of course it did.
- What do you mean?
We had the same saying with
my people and the Turks.
Do you?
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.
Listen, there is...
There's nothing I think we can agree
more with than our hatred for Britain.
I just have to say
that it actually...
It would be my absolute pleasure and
honor if I could call you my brother.
There is a way for you
to call me brother.
Last night, at dinner, I was...
charmed by your sister.
Is she spoken for?
Sadly, yes. She's to be married to
the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.
And what of her
younger sister? Anna?
Is there a formal
offer for Anna?
Well, you see, Anna,
she's 15 years old.
That is a detail.
Our friendship is built on our
mutual distrust of England.
When we hold to the Continental
Blockade, we choke them from the trade,
and we fight for our
most sacred rights.
That is what is
important between us.
I just had a thought.
- No.
- No, say it.
- Should I tell you?
- Please.
Imagine an army. 50,000 men.
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,
marching by way of
Constantinople into Asia
would have only to
reach the Euphrates
to make England tremble and
bring her down on her knees
before the continent.
It is incredible.
Toast.
- To you.
- To us.
His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon,
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria
and to His Majesty,
King Francis,
for the hand of the
archduchess, Marie-Louise.
His eldest daughter.
No.
This union would bring
together Austria and France
in an unbreakable
matrimonial bond.
Is this a joke?
I may find it humorous...
but His Majesty does not.
Did you have a pleasant journey?
It was wonderful. Thank you.
You're quite petite.
I'm not accustomed to that.
How do I look to you?
Do I resemble my portrait?
Oh, yes. And even more
handsome and strong.
And you are even more
handsome, more beautiful.
I hope you're pleased
with your choice.
I hope so too. Would you
like to see the bedroom?
Yes, thank you.
Your Majesty, your son.
Hello.
Fire!
My little king.
Hold.
Oh, sweet child.
One day, you will understand
what I have sacrificed for you.
My dear Joséphine,
I'm sad today.
Tsar Alexander has turned against
me and forced me to invade Russia.
{\an8}He's decided to open his ports to
England while taxing the French.
{\an8}I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.
{\an8}I've convinced the heads of
Europe of this resolution,
and so I command the combined
forces of France, Austria, Italy,
Germany and Poland.
I see nothing but
success in my future.
Keep your lines. Steady.
To the front.
Keep your step.
Take cover!
Get down!
Get down!
After them!
Whoa.
Whoa.
- Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
- Fall back!
{\an8}My dear Joséphine.
I'm writing to you because I have
just won a great battle today.
Tomorrow we will
resume our advance.
Moscow is now only
200 miles away.
And I think of you all
the while. All yours.
Nearly there.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Admiral.
- You were the brave of Austerlitz.
Where are you?
300,000 souls
lived in this city.
And they've all just left?
Little boy.
Where are you?
Don't be frightened.
I'm just gonna give
you a little spanking.
It's not very sporting, is it?
For his honor and
Russia's, not mine.
There's dignity to
be had in defeat.
Who did this?
They did.
No, they did not. Be sensible.
Who set these fires?
Your Majesty, they did.
He'd rather burn his own
city than negotiate with me.
I didn't think he
had the courage.
Well, we'll go to Saint Petersburg
and have him burn that too.
We have let too
much time slip away.
We would be marching
into the Russian winter
with horses that are not
raised for this weather.
If we go back to Poland, we
can wait out the winter months.
Napoleon, your letters are
a soothing balm to my heart.
I fear for you.
Remember that I alone know
your health, your fears.
I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.
Joséphine.
My friend, Joséphine.
"Friend."
It is strange to write
that word to you.
You have always
been so much more.
Despite careful organization, there
have been breakdowns in supply.
We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.
We are winning.
- Us or Cossacks?
- Us.
Joséphine. Fortune
has abandoned me.
{\an8}I know that it is
what fate has for me.
{\an8}Your words rattle in my head.
I am nothing without you.
Of the 600,000 men you sent to
Russia, only 40,000 have returned.
Therefore, you have been
exiled in no uncertain terms.
The allied coalition of Austria,
Prussia, Russia and England,
and with the agreement
of the French Council,
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.
A revenue of two million
francs from the French funds,
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie-Louise.
It also provides for Empress Joséphine
to retain all of her properties
and an allotted annual
income of one million francs.
I love France too much.
All I've desired was its glory.
I would never bring
her misfortune.
They want me to abdicate.
Fine, I'll abdicate.
Your Highness.
Empress.
Here.
Joséphine, Joséphine.
I am charmed.
But...
you do not have to lock yourself
away just because he's not here.
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.
But your eyes, your
charm and your spirit,
it is in there.
It is yours, and you can use it.
Dear Joséphine,
You are mine. You
will always be.
I cannot stand it any longer.
It has been 300
days on this rock,
and I'm ready to come home
and reclaim what's mine:
you and France.
I'm taking your ship.
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.
Napoleon,
I'm a flower that opens its
petals and smiles to the sunshine,
unconscious that the storm
is near which will lay me low
and scatter leaves
to the heavens.
Come quickly, my friend.
If you would open
your mouth, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.
My suggestion is to stay in bed.
But Napoleon is coming.
It would be unwise to
receive any visitors.
But Napoleon is coming.
I understand.
Just keep her comfortable.
Whoa!
Your Majesty.
You may speak.
Bonaparte, Your Majesty.
He has returned.
A ship landed on a beach
in Antibes this morning,
and they're on the march.
Napoleon Bonaparte is
marching towards Paris.
More.
Your Majesty.
Afternoon, Colonel.
Your Majesty.
General Marchand,
in defense of the royal
government of King Louis XVIII,
requests that you surrender your
weapons and cease your march
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?
I have no fight with
my own Fifth Army.
Sir.
He wishes to speak.
Make ready!
Present.
Soldiers of the Fifth
Regiment, do you recognize me?
Do you recognize me, soldiers?
Yes, Emperor!
I miss you.
I'm melancholy for my home...
and for our victories together.
I want to come home.
Will you join me?
Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!
On May 26th,
Dr. Corvisart was called
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.
Her illness was diphtheria.
On May 29th, last sacrament
was given, and she died.
And no one thought to notify me?
Hortense.
Do you blame...
Do you blame me?
I don't blame you.
Of course not.
I'm not to bear the
burden of responsibility
for the misfortunes
of your mother.
I want the letters
that I wrote to her.
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.
Where did she keep them?
In the cupboard in her
bedroom, next to her bed.
What did he do with them?
Her valet sold them.
I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
{\an8}Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed
{\an8}the only title upon which
his very existence depended.
{\an8}This congregation
of allies shall form
{\an8}along the borders of
France and Belgium an army.
70,000 troops from England,
120,000 troops from Prussia.
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe
while the farmers snored.
We should have struck
this blow long ago.
He has held the world
hostage with his egotism,
his insatiable hunger for power,
and his lack of
simple good manners.
We will all sleep
again without him.
I believe I speak for all of us when I
say that the only regret we all share
is that we allowed this
vermin to live at all.
250,000 men with the traitor.
25,000 men, 125,000 men
and 100,000 men...
against our 125,000 men.
This is a fight on land.
This is what Britain does not
know how to do that I know.
Strike quickly against
Wellington and Blücher.
Defeat them separately.
Disallow them from
uniting forces here.
Morning.
The Prussians are advancing.
We should begin the offensive.
We must wait for
the ground to dry.
Blücher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.
I never get wet
if I can help it.
What shall I tell the men?
Tell them to make the rain stop.
- Coming through!
- In formation!
Now's your time,
lads. Now's your time.
Now, listen very carefully.
Patience is the order of the day
today. Patience shall win the day.
We must hold this ground.
Let them come to us.
Huzzah!
Go on, boys. Go on.
Whoa.
Good morning, General Blücher.
- Good morning.
- Estimated time of arrival, sir?
- Officer?
- About five hours.
About five hours.
Come on, boys.
There he is.
He appears to be just sleeping.
One thing you cannot resist,
my friend, is a frontal attack.
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.
Sir. I have the emperor in my
sights. Do I have permission to fire?
Certainly not.
Generals commanding armies have
better things to do with their time
than to shoot at one another.
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.
Go on, boys. Come.
A runner coming through!
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.
Attention, follow me.
- Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
- Jesus Christ.
- I want a report every hour.
- Yes, sir.
Runner coming through. Make way.
Prussians on the
roadside, 12 miles.
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.
Ready the cannons.
Ready the cannons!
Go on! Move!
Ready! Cannons are ready!
Cannons are ready!
The rain has stopped, sir.
Prepare to fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Take cover!
Straight into position. Steady.
Prepare for the
advance. Get ready.
Prepare for the advance.
Readjust to 195!
Adjust 195!
Elevation 195.
Adjusted!
Prepare to fire! Fire!
Fire!
Keep your head down.
Seventh, take over.
- Out the way!
- Hold fast, men!
Infantry, advance!
Left company!
And march!
Get in formation. Now!
Keep to the line!
Join!
Second wave, advance!
Over the top, men!
Hold the line!
Cannons!
Fire!
Get ready.
Hold fast.
Fire!
You there, get on that cannon.
Fire!
Fill the gap!
Keep the line!
Skirmishers, keep advancing!
Get in formation.
Fire at will.
Keep them back, men. Fire.
Go on. Don't let them rally!
The strike position.
Get up, boys. Go
on. Go on, boys.
Whoa.
Prussians, roadside, five miles.
Five miles, maybe less.
We have to act before
Blücher arrives.
Out.
Out!
Cavalry!
Charge!
Prepare to receive cavalry.
We must hold our ground.
Stand fast to the last man.
We must not be beat!
Or what will they
say in England?
- Hold the line.
- Keep it tight.
Steady, men. Stay in formation.
Long live the emperor!
Company, halt!
Form square!
Long live the emperor!
One section, fire.
Two section, fire.
What do we do, sir? We
can't break through.
Keep them running. Get
in back with the square.
Show them your British steel.
Present arms!
Shoulder, hold!
They're here, the Prussians.
First over the rise, Emperor.
We need to find a way through!
Break the square!
Charge bayonets.
Charge bayonets!
Your Emperor is with you. You
are the brave of Austerlitz.
Never surrender.
For homeland and glory!
Shoulder to
shoulder! Form lines!
Shoulder to shoulder.
Infantry, advance.
Battalion!
Advance!
Keep the line!
Footmen, fire!
Second line, fire.
Prepare to charge!
Charge!
Go on! Batter them!
Advance!
Cavalry advance, sir?
Cavalry advance.
Prepare for counterattack.
Men, enter. Full support.
No. He can't help himself.
Sir, Blücher.
Thank God.
Your Majesty!
Come see how masse
de la France dines!
Yeah!
Yeah!
The battle is mine. There
will be an end to the war.
Senior officer, on deck!
Good day.
I am the first to admit when I
make a mistake. But I never do.
Because it is geometry.
I simply know precisely
where to place a cannon.
But tragically I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals.
That might be what is
most difficult in life.
Accepting the
failures of others.
You must not do that.
Encourage greatness.
Mind your head, sir.
Mind your head, sir.
- What are they doing there?
- Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.
Well, get 'em out.
Clear the room. Quickly.
- Your grace...
- Good morning, General.
These boys are delightful.
May I sit down?
Please.
And this breakfast.
Now I know why you have such
a successful navy. Thank you.
I've never visited the
English countryside.
I imagine I'll love
the Cotswolds...
soft flowing hills,
gentle light.
My dear sir, it is only by
a narrow margin of opinion
that you have been spared
the fate of being shot.
Politically, I'm
afraid it's impossible
for the British government to
allow you to stay in England.
You are permitted three
officers and 12 servants
to accompany you into exile.
Exile will be contained to
the island of Saint Helena
under the watchful eye of Governor
Hudson Lowe and his family.
Saint...
Helena. It's a small island.
More of a rock, really.
A thousand miles from
the mainland of Africa.
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.
Your correspondence
will be monitored,
your presence verified twice
daily by the orderly officer.
Fix that rigging line.
Draw up the sails.
Go below deck!
What will you do now? I
hate to see you alone.
Will you come to me?
Will I forgive you?
My sweet, stubborn Emperor.
I let you loose and
let you come to ruin.
Next time, I will be Emperor,
and you will do as I say.
Well, you were right.
Every night I beg to
see you in my dreams.
And when I do, you turn me away.
Girls, what's the
capital of France?
Paris.
And Russia?
Petersburg. And Moscow before.
Moscow. And who burnt
Moscow to the ground?
I don't know, sir.
I did.
I believe, sir, the Russians
burnt it to get rid of the French.
Who told you that?
It's common knowledge, sir.
Go. Go play.
En garde.
Can I tell you what I
have waiting for you?
It is a secret. And I will
show you when you arrive.
Come to me, Napoleon.
And let's try this again.
