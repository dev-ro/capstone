I'm sorry I'm so late.
-I said I'm sorry.
-Yes... we know.
Happy birthday, honey!
Thank you.
-All the best.
-Thanks.
Cool.
Look... I need to show you something.
Wait a minute...
Tim gave me this.
Did he leave the receipt in the bag?
-Thank you.
-This is from all of us.
We women can have three
orgasms, while men come only once.
I was at the Panda the other day
with Tom, and I almost went crazy.
Panda sex... it makes the Kama Sutra
look like beginner's gymnastics.
-Hello, Chayenne.
-Hey.
-Hi.
-I hear it's your birthday.
-Yes.
-Best wishes.
-Thanks.
-I'm sorry... what's your name again?
-Inken.
-Right, Inken.  I can't seem to remember that.
Well, are you ready for the game?
-Don't you face elimination?
Yes... but we still have two games left.
Sorry, but we won't spot you any points.
I want to see you girls sweat.
Laura, go deeper, get your head in the game.
-Kasten, do you have your girls get to play?
-Yes, Logo.
That's fantastic.
Let's go!
That doesn't matter.
No problem... settle down!
-Say, have you been working out?
-Me?  Nope.
It shows.
[A trumpet isn't the only thing you can blow!]
I love you...
-Is everything okay?
-I guess so... but I think I'd rather sleep.
-Man, was that ever a mess.
-And the finals are in a week.
-Are you coming to the party?
-I don't I ought to.
No wonder that Chayenne has so much
energy.  She comes three times during sex!
-I really don't understand it.
-I'm looking forward to the our finals.
-God.
-Do you think we can bribe someone?
I don't think even
Chayenne fucks the principal.
Super.  I think I'll grab a shower.
-Here.
-Thanks.
Wait a minute.  Before I forget,
I have a gift from my mother.
-Hopefully this is not another video.
-Yeah... I'm afraid so.
As I sat with my mother on her deathbed ...
...she regretted that she
never had an orgasm in her life...
I took her in my arms and we both wept.
My life changed after my first orgasm.
I redecorated my apartment,
and I've mastered my exams.
So... for a moment, time
stands still, and it feels like flying.
It's like pure energy is
pumping through your veins.
When the orgasm reached its
peak, I fainted for a moment.
-It's like a miracle.
-I was briefly in nirvana.
Yes, but ... those women were all over thirty.
-Yeah... right before they begin to sag.
-Well I don't have any sagging breasts.
-Women age faster.
-Really?
In a week summer vacation is over and
Tim will be gone, and we'll have done nothing.
I still need my first boyfriend.
Man, what an asshole!
Yeah...
Men!
Does a person need to have a lot of sex
before you have an orgasm?
-It requires having the right technique!
-So you've had one?
Of course I have.
And it leaves you full of energy?
Oh... actually I'm pretty exhausted afterwards.
-Hi. mom.
-Let me talk to Inken.
Inken?  It's for you.
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...
happy birthday, dear Inken,
happy birthday to you.
-Well... did Vicky play the video?
-Yes.
Thank you very much...
it was really interesting.
Vicky said your boyfriend
isn't able to give you an orgasm.
-Well, well, I, er...
-Stop!  No "I, er..."!
Don't fall into the old role, and make
yourself responsible for sexual gratification.
Remember, it is the first man
who sets the course for the future.
Sure.  I understand,
so I think he ... has indeed ...
Mom... I'm sorry, we are going to be late.
Thanks for calling.  Love you.  Bye.
Later...
Why did you go and tell
your mother that Tim... that he...
-That loser?
-Tim can be so sweet.
-Have you had an orgasm?
-No.
Of course not,
because Tim is a loser.
Stop, that's my house!
Well, this ought to be interesting.
-Man, my panties got up my crack.
-Shall I help you, lnken?
-That might be nice.
-Nice?  Your panties are like a graveyard.
Is way cool that you came - I'm so pleased.
Hey, there you are!
Happy birthday, lnken!
-Good to see you.
-Hello.
-We all chipped in to get you a present.
-Ah... a fondue pot?
Cool... thanks.
Okay, remember not to lean against
the walls, you know about the wallpaper.
And use the ashtrays, no
bottles on the woodwork, don't...
...and be careful of scratches.
Put your things over there.
Isn't this some great dance music?
And the boys from the Chillmasters are coming.
-What masters?
-The Chillmasters, a cool band.
We went to school together,
and they're really cool.
So take it easy, okay?
I have to go.  Bye...
Hi!
The Chillmasters...
But this is really a first-class spread.
-Where are the drinks?
-These will do the job.
Here you go, girls.  After all, we aren't here for fun.
So then...
Get yourselves ready.
Sorry... can you stand up?
Here... you can sit down again.
-Who are you?
-We're with Inken.  Didn't she tell you?
No.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Happy Birthday.
-Thanks.  It's also Julia's Birthday.
-Really?  Best wishes.
-Thanks.
Congratulations to both of you, I'm Dirk.
-Hi, Mouse.
-Hi.
Hey guys, are you old enough to shave?
Honey, I need to talk with you.
See you later.
-Are you leaving already?
-No, we just want to talk.
Well, go ahead, if it isn't too serious.
What an ass!
-Who's that?
-That's Dirk.
God, I hope no more sixteen-year-olds show up.
[other countries - other tits]
But I thought we came in here to talk.
Afterwards, sweety.
Hey, I'll be just a second.
-Can you please put this underneath you?
-Okay.
That would be great.
Until you're finished.
Hello.
Well... how's the food?
Damn!
-Skull... you asshole!
-You're not mad because of a little water.
Fuck off, man!
-I could suck on your finger.
-Go fuck your mother!!
Here come the Chillmasters!
Here come the Chillmasters!
-The Chillmasters are coming!
-Yes, hit me, Baby.
Who is that?
-Do you like him?
-Nonsense... I don't even know him.
The Chillmasters...
-Oh, Tim...
-What?
I have to tell you something.
I've never had an orgasm.
What?
That's terrible.
-Why haven't you told me before now?
-I'm telling you now.
Well, then I'll help you celebrate your birthday...
...by making a special effort just for you.
It's the only thing to do.
-I need to pee.  How about you?
-Not yet.
Tell me, do you really go to school with Vicky?
-Yes... for about eight years.
-Eight years?
Well, I may be mistaken...
Hey, this is my song!
Hey, could you dance to this?
It's only a vacation video taken by my parents.
The one on the right.
I think he's really nice.
But one shouldn't decide
so early in the evening.
-You just walk over to him.
-Do you really?
Well... sure.
Go.
Hi.
-No.
-I'm going to the bathroom.
Hi.  I've heard you're
the worst driver in the world.
How 'bout we go out
and maybe fuck a little?
If you don't mind if I puke on you.
Do you mind if I press the
pillow over your face when I come?
-So we won't cry out together.
-Makes sense.
Mama?
Papa?
Sorry.
Come on!  Give it to me!
You fathead!  I meant you should press the
pillow over your face when I come, not when you come.
What?  You mean you didn't come yet?
-Like when?
-Well, since you made that "mmmm" sound.
-That wasn't an orgasm.
-Didn't you feel anything?
-There was a warm feeling.
-Well, that must be it.
-I think we need to break up.
-Really?
Look... you're not the first girl I've slept with.
Have you see Vicky?
Hey, Lena... isn't it time 
for little girls to be going home?
It is getting pretty late.
So why don't you leave, Skull?
Sorry, it was only a question.
Say, have you ever used one of these?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I only wanted to make a bet with you.
I'll bet you can't blow up this rubber until it bursts.
Have you lost your mind?
Why would I want to do that?
Well, it's clear that you're too afraid.
You always back down when you're challenged.
-I refuse to be put on the spot.
-See... you backed down again.
-No I didn't.
-If you can do it... 2O bucks.
-But only if you join in on it.
-Sure, that's obvious.  It's the only way.
Okay - go for it.
That little girl is so weird that
she's doing this to win a the bet.
Hey, baby... you should have seen your face!
Never mind that.
I won the bet... so fork over my 20 bucks.
You want another 20 bucks?
Maybe you'll blow me?
Skull, you're a real jerk!
Hey, wait...
He's drunk.  He's had too much -
don't pay any attention to him.
I don't give a damn!
He should pay, or he can kiss my ass.
He can do whatever he wants.
I don't care.
I can't find my damned socks.
You always insist I take them off.
I'm going to go get a drink now, okay?
So that was my birthday,
and it was nothing special.
But much easier had I not
been expecting too much.
Everything would be easier if
one didn't always expect so much.
But I can't.
Especially not as I get older.
-You want it from the front or the back?
-It doesn't matter.
Well?  Two hours of theory,
two minutes in practice?
Come.
Excuse me.
Lena?  Man... what was that?
lnken?  Ah... there you are.
Say, have you seen Lena?
-No.
-Man... I'm ready to go home.
So... how did it go in there?
Yes... great.
It was totally great, of course.
And you?  Did you hook up with someone?
Yes, but... you might say that.
Yes, I've been so ...
So... here you are.
Still angry?
Skull's an ass.
He pulled that trick on me once.
That was a great end-of-summer
party - easily 200 people.
But I guess it was also embarrassing.
-Heres' what Skull owes you.
-I don't care about that now.
Isn't it funny how everything
in life depends on chance?
Like what?
Well, everything.  Think about it, when
the evening began, who'd expect...
... to see their father going crazy on the television.
-Right.
Too bad that mistake wasn't planned.
Julia's parents would play well on television.
So you passed out a dead faint?
There you are.  Man... we're ready
to go home.  Are you coming?
Come on!
-Can I call you?
-Yes... sure.
-How can I reach you?
-Dial information... they'll help you.
And...?
We're in love.
-What... you two are in love?
-I think that it's love.
From what I saw nothing happened.
Didn't he at least kiss you?
But, but... what I mean...
one shouldn't kiss on the first date.
Lena, that's nonsense!
I mean, if he doesn't...
Wait just a minute.
If he didn't try to kiss you,
then he isn't interested.
Well... maybe.
-Have another sip?
-No thanks.
You needn't worry.  I'm totally sober.
-Listen, Vicky.
-Please, please, please, please.
No, "Listen, Vicky," got it?
That's how my mother starts in on me.
I'll be all right.
-Papa?
-lnken, what are you doing here?
-I live here.
-Yes... naturally...
Didn't you plan to stay at Vicky's house?
So, sleep well... until tomorrow.
Until tomorrow.
Hi.
Hi.
-How did you like the party?
-It was tops.  And you?
Yeah... great.  Totally great.
Are your parents out of town?
For a couple of weeks.
-Where have been all this time?
-I had to have a talk with Tim.
Is that right?  About the
sayings on his t-shirts, or what?
He's an extraordinary guy with unusual tastes.
I think he's just an ordinary guy with no taste.
-But that's just a matter of opinion.
-Where are you going now?
Just hanging out.
-Did he keep his socks on?
-No, he did not!
Funny... I always keep my
socks on when I'm having a talk.
Hello!  You must be Inka.
-lnken.
-Yeah, that's it.  Kristin.
-Aren't you from the modeling agency?
-That's right.
Tell me, has your father really been
without a woman for four years?
-Yes.
-He exploded like a rocket.
He sure knows how to handle a woman.
May I borrow your towel, lnka... ?
Sure.
Everyone has sex.
Really... any stupid cow can have an orgasm.
Except me.
Anyway, it makes sense
not to jump into these things.
What do I have to complain about?
Basically, I'm fine.
Children are starving in Africa.
Good morning!
Allow me to serve you.
-How are you and Tim?
-We're okay.
He treats you well?
Good.
Don't you think Kristin is really nice?
["Until next time"]
Perhaps you could free up a
shelf for her in the bathroom?
Sure.
I'm so angry.  I know I've failed.
I'm having nightmares about this.
I'll never graduate.  My mother will throw me...
I'll end up as an unemployed perfume
salesperson, burdened with a loser husband.
Shit!  That fucking math...
Maybe I should go to bed with him,
if I wasn't taught to be so pure.
There's no mail for you today, Vicky.
-New bike?
-I got it for my birthday.
Only the seat is still a little bit too high.
She needs to take that bike in for an adjustment.
Hi, Mouse... did we have a date?
[Sperm has Vitamin C]
No we don't... I just need
to talk with you again, Tim.
-So you came by to thank me.
-Thank you?
Yes, of course.
About last night.
Sure... that's a great idea.
Let me think where to begin...
For the hours of foreplay?
For the sexist words on your t-shirts?
Or for nearly suffocating me under a pillow?
No, Tim, I can't think of
anything for which to thank you .
I would like you to know
that I've had my first orgasm.
-How??  With whom?
-With my bicycle.
-No... you don't mean to say...
-Yes, Tim.
You know what, do what you like...
but only with girls with vitamin C deficiency.
Maybe they'll fall for your crap.
-So tell me, do you have a problem?
-No... not now.
-lnken, I hope you enjoy yourself!
-I already have.
You can't imagine what happened to me...
I had an gigantic orgasm!
On my new bike.
I didn't want to go home...
...because I was in
danger of making up with Tim.
I'm done with him.
You should have seen his face...
-Really?
-Oh... it's you, Mrs. Lindner.
May I please speak with Lena?
Yes.  Lena, I think it's your friend Inken.
The one who just had a
gigantic orgasm on her new bike.
What?
This is unbelievable.
-How long did it take?
-Just up and down Main Street.
I told Tim I knew about what happened,
and he was still expecting to have sex with me.
-Really... he's an idiot!
-You should be glad you're rid of him.
Yes.  And you know, some
women marry these kind of men...
...and then develop cysts from
trying to have multiple orgasms.
I think...
I think I'm going to come!
I feel something.
I feel it creeping up on me...
I'm coming!!!
Vicky, are you alright?
I have a confession.
I've never had one.
So I... I finally had an orgasm.
Never.
Never before.
But... but you've always...
Yeah... but that was a lie.
-And how do you feel?
-I really don't know.
I mean, what kind of woman
has her first orgasm on a bike?
My cousin had her first on
the horizonal beam in gymnastics.
Yes, but what's with that?
Somehow, that's not the same.
Wait a minute.
When I get home, I go straight to
the garage or basement workshop.
I have to get away.  You know,
my wife talks about nothing but sex.
I can't go on.  It's so vulgar, I can't go on.
Excuse me.
Yes... hi, mom.  I'm fine.
I need to ask you a question.
By bicycle, it can only be clitoral.
Never vaginal.
For most women,
it can only be one or the other.
There are some women
who can have both in combination.
If, for example, you sit on
a man with your weight forward...
...and he raises his pelvis and
then you squeeze your vaginal muscles...
-Momma, that's more than I need to know.
-Did I answer your question?
Thanks.  Goodbye.
Hey, now we don't need to be depressed.
Anyway, this is great.
You're the first one of us to have an...
...I had an expresso.
-Yes, but only clitoral  ...expresso.
...and from my bicycle seat.
It doesn't do any good worrying.
We have make use of this in the locker room.
-The locker room?
-Of course!
All three of you are having
your period at the same time?
Women who spend a lot of
time together have the same cycle.
Really?
I've read that geishas put
the condom on with their mouths.
Okay?
So, children... is everthing well with you?
Just don't swallow those things.
That's an oral masterpiece.
Compared to this, next year's
oral exams will be a no brainer.
-I can't.
-I can't, either.
-Have either of you felt anything?
-No.
I don't understand it.
The other day I came within a minute.
-Oh... it doesn't matter.
-At least we've gotten some exercise.
"What turns you on?"
A: A savings account.
B: A marriage proposal.
C: A candle-light dinner.
D: A sado-masochist sex toy.
-D.
-What kind of test is that?
"What turns you on?"
But that's awfully transparent.
"What do you like to do in bed?"
A: lntramural games.
B: Punishment.
C: Group sex.
D: All of the above.
-D.
-Is that what you really like?
No, but 'D' gave me the highest score.
The goal isn't to get the highest score,
but to find out about yourself.
I am extremely passionate.
But what do these psycho-assholes know?
-Where did you get this nonsense?
-From papa's new girlfriend, Kristin.
The orgasm-fairy.
I have to go to the bathroom.
"If you're looking for a man for
whom you're not just a number...
...but his true love in a real relationship...
...then the following rules will lead you to your goal:
Never call him right after you meet.
Don't go to the movies on your first date.
Always be the one who ends a call."
-Hello?
-Hi, Nick, it's me, Lena.
-Hi, Lena.
-I apologize for calling right now.
I'm doing anything important.
Sure, I've been really busy too.
I just had to force myself to stop and call.
-Do you have any plans for tonight?
-Would you like to get together?
-Sure, how about going to a movie?
-A movie?
-Hello?  Lena?
-Yeah, sure.  A movie it is.  Movies are great.
-Let's meet at 7:00?
-Seven.  Yeah... sure.
Okay, you had to, I... my turn to play.
We'll meet at seven, then?
Yes, I...
Idiot.
-I thought this movie would be funny.
-Never mind, it's okay.
You think it's boring, right?
Well, I don't usually come to the cinema to read.
You know what?
I think I'm a lesbian.
Naked men look silly.
Something is always flopping around.
I've got an idea.
Let's place a personal ad.
-How will you advertise?
-On the Internet.
My mother auctioned a
glass wall cabinet on the Internet.
A wall cabinet?
Here you are, darling... something to eat.
"What turns you on?
Sado-masochist sex toys."
Say, have you ever had sex?
-With someone other than myself?
-Yes.
No... you?
-What are they doing over there?
-Probably talking about us behind our backs.
Vicky is addicted to the Internet.
If you could choose any woman,
who would you pick?
lnken...
or Pamela Anderson.
-Let'so over to Inken's.  I'll ring the bell.
-What for?
Yeah... tell her you want
her to let you pop her cherry...
...because Pamela Anderson has no time for you.
No, stupid... wait.
Maybe something like:
"I like laughter, joy and honesty...
and I like screwing at any time."
Yeah... that's to avoid getting nothing but wimps.
Wait!  How about...
"Let the sparks fly."
Short and to the point.
No?
I have it!
"Poke your penis..." ?
-Can I see you tomorrow?
-Well, no, I...
I think I have something planned.
That's too bad.
Well then...
At three?
-Sleep well.
-See you tomorrow.
Hey, they're coming.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hello!
We'd like to visit,
but we really have to run some errands.
Yes, we do.  Hello!!
Time to intercept some letters.
Well...
Another time.
Now come along!
She's perfect in pink.
-What's going on with Flin?  I think he's sweet on you.
-Ah, Vicky...
Vicky, I've known him for ages.
There he is!
-And?
-There's no mail for you, Vicky.
Thanks.
-He won't show up.
-Nonsense.  Maybe he's already here.
There's a guy over there
who's been looking at us the whole time.
-Go on, I'll bet that's him.
-I don't know...
Go on.
-Hi.
-Hi.
"I'm the girl who wants 
to be poked with a penis...
...who wants total pleasure
and tenderness, with consummate skill.
I don't want some fag posing as a man.
I want wet panties."
Say what?
"Wet panties" ?
Sorry.
-And?
-That wasn't him.
That wasn't the one?
Hi... I'm Thorsten.
I think we have an appointment.
Hello.
-Ready to swing?  My car's outside.
-Sure.
Well... good luck.
Hey guys, I think we 
should cut a few tracks about tits.
-Why tits?
-Sure, man ... tits, they make me hot.
Will you guys knock it off with
the tits?  What rhymes with tits?
Oh sure.  You can't stand tits.
You go for the little kiddies.
I'm cool... just give me the beat.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Hi.
The rehearsal area is down in the cantina.
Guys, I will not lie, it was
easy for me to hook up with the virgin...
The hottest chicks 
come here, all bored with sex...
They can never get enough,
but I doubt I'll ever hear Lena cry out...
Will I get this woman, still
untouched, to ever give herself up?
Boys... I don't think so.
The woman is sexless.
Always was, and always will be.
Hey, Sexless Lena, I've been
waiting so long, for you to give me an erection.
Hey, Sexless Lena.
Don't be shy, come on in and show us your tits.
-That was stylish, man.
-"Sexless Lena."
-Well... back so soon?
-I only had a little time.
Were you hoping to get laid?
Girl... we'll wipe the floor with you.
Yes we will.
Bye...
Lesbian-Chat
My chat-name: "Lavazza"
"Hi Lavazza, here is Joy."
My God.
"Are you unable to speak?"
"No."
"Is this you first time alone with a woman?"
"I really wanted to know if 
there is something else out there."
"For you to understand, I'll have to show you."
"For you to understand, I'll have to show you."
"That's why you're here, right?"
"Yes."
"Okay.  Then lean back in your chair 
for a lesson.  I'll tell you what to do."
This is really great, that 
we're able to use your place.
Since I'm in a shared apartment 
this could get a bit embarrassing.
Sure... no problem.
My dad is at the University.
-And he won't be home soon?
-I doubt it.
Good.
-Take a look... see if there's something you like.
-Sure.
Didn't you find anything?
Excuse me.
-Hi, Flin.
-Hey, would you like to come out with me?
No, I'm sorry.  I haven't finished my lessons.
-Can I help you with that?
-No, I can handle it.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah... sure.
-Really?
-Can we get back to work?
Well then... have fun.
Perhaps another iced tea?
"Lavazza: I'm totally..."
"Joy: Did you come?"
"Lavazza: What do you really look like, Joy?"
I liked your ad.
It was so childlike...
but also quite wicked.
I was stoned when I wrote it.
Really?
You smoke pot?
That's great.
Come here!  I want you!!
I've been waiting for you so long.
I'll be right back.
Where is your bathroom?
Don't run off.
-For you.  It's Nick.
-I'm not here.
She's not at home!
Oh, Thorsten...
...I'm sorry, but I'm having second thoughts.
I would rather leave things as they are.
-What is that?
-An erection ring.  Made from industrial steel.
-Isn't it a bit tight?
-Yes... I can't get it off.
-Your thing is turning quite blue.
-How blue?
Oh fuck.  I'll get a blood clot.
Shit!   Shit!
This damn thing will kill me!
My God... do something!  Come on!
Help me, please... do something!
-Okay.  I'll be right back... okay?
-Yes... hurry!
Be very, very still.
One, two, three...
This will do it!
-It's for cutting metal!
-Are you crazy?
-What happens if you slip with that?
-And if we do nothing, it falls off.
You know, my dad always
said I lacked fine motor skills.
Oh great... just do it.  Okay?
Oh... hi, dad.  
We were just talking about you.
Oooo... that's nasty.
But I think I can take care of it.
I once castrated a bull, who didn't 
know what the world held in store for him.
A veterinarian.
So, now sit down.
Relax, relax.
Hello?
Are you all right?
God!
I can't get it to come!
-Gero!
-Kristin!
It isn't what you think.
-Then what is all this?
-I just wanted to give you pleasure.
Pleasure?
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Joy, what are you doing here?
-What?
-l'm Lavazza.
-La-who?
That was incredible
what you did for me.
I don't know you!  I've never
seen you before!  Just leave me alone!
-Do you live here?
-No, I don't.
So you're married and your husband
doesn't know about us.  Is that right?
-God, is everyone insane?
-But... Joy!
Taxi!   Wait!
The physical stuff...  that can wait!
This whole stupid, fucking orgasm business!
My life is a mess!
I don't want any more to do with it.
It was probably invented by men,
so that they could keep us down.
I will never go on the Internet again.
I will never have sex again.
I feel like throwing up at the very thought of it.
I've never had sex.
Who needs sex?
Men can go fuck themselves.
I think it has nothing to do with happiness.
When I was little, all I wanted was a boat.
I was happy.
I played with it twice... in the basement.
Maybe I just wasn't meant to be happy.
I'd still be totally
unhappy even if I had orgasms.
My mother's had lots of orgasms.
But she isn't happy.
I believe I inherited my unhappiness.
I can't live like this anymore.
Neither can I.
I'll die a virgin.
Excuse me, Lena, 
but what are you doing there?
Well, before I die, 
I'm going to get even with Skull.
And what are those?
Viagra pills!
Maybe we should go to 
the athletes' party tonight.
I mean, after all, 
they're holding it for us.
Bring us whatever beer you have.
Okay, here's my plan for tonight:
I'll get drunk, and someone will hold me
back until Chayenne crosses my path.
Skull.
-Hi, Skull.
-Hi, Lena.  How's everything with you?
-Super, how about you?
-I'm cool, thank you.
I brought something for you.
Viagra pills... cool.
-How much do they cost?
-Don't bother, these are a sample.
But be careful, this stuff is pretty powerful.
You might want to try just one.
They aren't supposed to be that bad.
I'll be all right.
-Well... I you think you have the stamina.
-Yeah, sure... that should be obvious.
Cool!  Thanks, I'm ready to go.
No problem.
Have fun.
Listen up girls.
Which one of you would like to fuck me?
How about you?
No, no, no...
This can't be... what's keeping
the fucking thing up?  Is this for real?
Come on.
What's that?
What do you think it is?
Something I built with carrots?
I'm holding 3 liters of beer,
and I've got to unload soon, so fuck off!
-Is there anyone in here who can help you with that?
-Leave me alone.
Alright... here it comes.
Ah... damn!
Shit!  Here comes Nick.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Hey, have either of you seen Lena?
-No... why?
-Didn't I see her hanging out with you?
-I don't know... maybe she's with someone.
Can you explain something to her?
Tell her I know about that...
...know about that...
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I don't know if I can remember
all that, but I'll try and tell her.
-Skull, what's going on?  Do you have a problem?
-No, no... everything's all right.
I think that's a problem.
-Hey, let's keep it our secret, okay?
-Yeah, sure... you bet.
Try doing a handstand.
A handstand?
Listen up everyone, Skull is on 
the bathroom floor doing a handstand!
With a huge hard-on!
-Hey buddy, is everything all right with you?
-Come on, don't leave me like this!
Hi.
I heard you had a problem.
"Busy"
-I'm ready to go home.
-Good idea.
I'll come with you.
Lena? Have you been here all this time?
-Yes.
-Didn't your grandmother tell you I called?
-Yes.
-Are you coming, Lena?
But I've really got to go.
I have to go.
Won't you at least listen to his apology?
This song is for the girl whom I've wronged.
I'm going home.
I can't stand this sappy music.
I'll stay a bit longer.
I need to go to the bathroom.
-Okay... I'll go alone.
-You've got to know...
...that I care...
You've got to know
that I need you...
more than I can bear.
You've got to know
that I Iove you.
You've got to
know that I care.
You've got to know
that I need you.
more than I can bear.
I close my eyes and I want
to tell you every time...
that I need you by my side.
I feel your breath and I think 
it touches me, the way I feel for you.
I can't hide.
You've got to know
that I Iove you.
You've got to
know that I care.
You've got to know
that I need you...
more than I can bear.
Dear God...
-Hey, Flin.
-Hi.
-Do you have a moment?
-Sure.
This may seem kind of sudden, but
I want you to know how I feel...
I've been involved with other guys,
but what I...
-But what?
...I realize that I'm very fond of you.
You're the only boy I've ever been around
that I haven't tried to have an orgasm.
-And that's supposed to be a compliment?
-Yes.
That's love... right?
I really don't know.
Frankly, I was taught to
believe love was something else.
-What do you mean?
-That there's so much more to it.
But I... we know each other so well.
That's it exactly.
I'm scared that we could lose all that.
I see.
You're probably right.  I've been so stupid.
I'm sorry.  I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Hi.
What are you doing here?
My scooter is broken.
Do you know when the next bus is coming?
No idea.
I have enough for a taxi.
You see... there was a burned out 
cable, so my modem wouldn't work.
That's why my computer wouldn't work.
I rebuilt it... and discovered I 
could decode anyone's chat name.
That's how I came upon your chat.
You did what?!
How could you decode a screen-name?
Lavazza...
Noooo...
What you're telling me... it wasn't bad. 
But it's really more than I can handle.
Alright, come on... Joy.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Pardon me, but aren't you 
the one with the "wet panties"?
I wish I were dead!
-Should I take another tumble?
-Yes, please.
-Can I help you?
-Yes, please... thank you.
Here.
-Where are you heading?
-That way.
Good.  I think we'd better walk?
This is the fourth tire this year.
I made it!
"Barely passed!"
I passed!
Congratulations, Vicky...
Yes!!
Hi, aren't you Inken's father?
I'm Ingrid, Vicky's mom.
I've heard a lot about you.
["How was I, baby?"]
I knew we could do it!
This can't be happening!
Get in there, girls!
Yes!  This is it!
