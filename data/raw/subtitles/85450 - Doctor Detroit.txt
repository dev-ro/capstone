Five eight-minute miles,
less corrections
for construction zone
plus traffic
and liquids...
Adjusted ETA downtown
is now three minutes
plus 10 coming down.
# Call me doctor #
[all chattering]
Bye!

# Don't you wonder why #

# Don't you try to run #
Hey, hey, look.
He's some kind of nut.
Look at him.
Loves his exercise.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, man. Nice legs.
Fuck you!
# Now is the time
to call me doctor #
# This is a serious case #
# There's not much time,
now call me doctor #
# They love to
watch him operate #
Ow, sweet thing!
How you doing, baby?
Good morning,
baby, how are you?
Good morning,
Miss Blittstein.
Fix your shirt.
You're so sloppy.
(Smooth)
Come on, girls.
Let's go to work.
# It comes and goes
so call me doctor #
# They need
a special technique #
# It grows and grows,
now call me doctor #
# Calling Doctor,
Doctor Detroit ##
(Diavolo)
Hey, Boss,
check out the geek!
Yeah, I want you
to see this guy.
Slow down, Diavolo.
It's the same guy.
He's cute.
He's got nice legs
for a geek.
You're right.
Forget it, we're late.
Let's go, Diavolo.
[Tires screeching]
Marvelous.
(Smooth)
Well, anchors away,
sweetheart.
Don't forget to
take the Dramamine.
Oh, come on, Jasmine, baby.
What can he do
that I can't do?
Never mind.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Hi, Stretch.
Are you getting taller
or did I break a heel?
Not to mention
checks aren't supposed to
bounce, are they?
(Durant)
Here comes young Skridlow.
Good afternoon, Skridlow.
Right on time.
Finish classes.
Six miles into town
to the Faculty Club as usual
and now
I'm indulging myself.
Dinner out and a movie.
Bye.
Look, I paid $50 for this tie
and I think
it looks great, okay?
(Diavolo)
I would have
bought the other one.
I didn't hire you to
be a fashion consultant,
I hired you to drive.
So, please, just drive. Hmm?
Well, one day I'm gonna have
my own driver
because I'm gonna be an actor.
Look, Diavolo,
just cut the Sidney Poitier
impressions, okay?
They'll call me Mr. Diavolo!
Fine.
[Tires screeching]
Hey, wait a second, man.
What the fuck's
going on here?
Who is it?
It says "Mom's."
That's one of Mom's cars.
(Diavolo)
Hey, man, where the fuck
you get your driver's license?
[Horn honking]
Hey, Smooth!
Yeah, here's
the Yul Brynner clones.
Hey, Smooth Walker!
Me?
Yeah, you,
you son of a bitch!
Mom wants to see you!
Silly me, I thought we were
in the middle of
a motorcade here.
Aren't you boys on your way
to the Cue-ball Convention?
Yeah, you...
Hey, man.
Watch it, asshole.
Just be cool
and drive, okay?
Keep your eyes
on the road.
Say, I just had
this motherfucker
washed and waxed?
Be cool.
Say, Boss,
you want me to
lose these assholes?
[Tires screeching]
Come on, get out.
Let's go, Kingfish.
Mom's waiting.
Take it easy on the suit.
You want
the Asshole of the Year Award?
You got my vote, okay?
Take it easy, Johnny.
Okay, guys, listen,
I can walk by myself, okay?
What are you guys,
training wheels?
Hi, Mom. Pleasure
to see you, as always.
You owe me $80,000.
Uh, $60,000.
I'm a couple of months behind.
$80,000.
$20,000 extra is
a late-payments penalty.
There are lots of
other penalties, you know?
Look, Mom, I'm doing my best.
I mean, I got overhead...
Shut up!
The only reason
you're walking around
with both knees
is 'cause
you got a class act.
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.
You give me your money,
the girls,
everything else you've got.
We'll call it even.
What about me?
I'll let you live.
Quiet.
Mom, I mean,
you know how things work
in this town.
If it was up to me alone,
I'd be thrilled
to settle this thing
with you,
but, well,
l... I got a new partner.
Another partner?
This guy,
this dude from Detroit.
Uh, he just moved in on me.
Detroit? Are you kidding?
I know people in Detroit.
Not this guy.
I mean, he's too big.
He's too bad.
He's as bad as you are.
Maybe even badder.
(Smooth)
I'm scared, Mom,
and that's why l... I go
along with the Doctor.
The Doctor?
Yeah, Doctor.
Doctor...
Detroit.
I don't know if
he's really from Detroit,
maybe that's just
a handle he uses.
You mean you
let this jerk-off
muscle in on Mom?
Just let him in without...
Just let him in?
I'm scared, Mom.
He's a scary guy.
I gotta meet this Doctor.
I'll... I'll see if I can
arrange a meeting,
but do me a favor, Mom.
Just leave me out of it.
I've suffered enough.
Okay, boys, turn him loose.
If he gets out of line,
you can have him for lunch.
Get the fuck
out of here!
Diavolo.
Where to, Boss?
Australia, South Pole,
China, okay?
I gotta stop and get gas,
you know that.
Just drive, okay. Please?
[Horn honking]
[Siren wailing]
[Tires screeching]
Hey, man,
I hate to say this again
but you got your little fuzzy
white ass in a crack.
And you know there
isn't any Doctor Detroit.
You just pissed
away the money.
Please, I know what I did.
I am trying to
figure a way out!
Yeah, okay, okay, well,
you just remember that you
didn't spend any
of that money on me.
It doesn't matter, bro.
You are in this with me.
I'm not going down alone.
Wait a second, man,
what are you talking about?
It's not my fault that you
spent all that money
on those clothes, shoes,
this big gas-guzzling tank,
and that penthouse of yours.
Diavolo, I didn't
say it was your fault,
I said it was your problem.
Now we have to find
ourselves a patsy, okay?
Well, what kind of
patsy you talking about?
I don't know.
Somebody who could be
Doctor Detroit,
whatever the hell that is.
A yo-yo.
Where are you gonna
find a geek like that?
(man #1)
Yep, yep, how was it?
(man #2)
Terrible.
"Mulligatawny soup,
lamb vindaloo,
alu parathas, saag"...
All on the special.
Perfect.
Excuse me, please.
Pardon me, sir.
Guptar!
Mr. Skridlow, welcome.
Namaste.
Namaste.
Please, this way.
Mr. Skridlow,
the lamb vindaloo is
very, very good this evening.
That's just what
I was thinking.
What a coincidence.
I will bring
the waiter over right away.
(both)
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Jasmine)
So he wears
this little sailor suit
[women laughing]
And I do my best
"Flower of the Orient" number.
Like it's 1931 and we're
in Long Bar in Shanghai.
That sounds like fun.
Till we play
"find the gunboat."
Hey!
Isn't that
the funny-looking guy
with the great legs?
(Karen)
Ooh, yeah.
Great legs, nice tushie,
I think he's cute.
Hi, honey.
Ah, he didn't hear me.
[Women chattering]
Hiya, girls.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Hey, you made it.
Just barely.
Ah, Bourbon, no ice, double.
What's the matter, Smoothie,
you had a rough day, honey?
Been talking business
all day long.
Just money, money.
Blah, blah...
And?
And, everything is fine.
Girls, girls, look,
it takes a lot of
time and energy
just to cover our investments
every day, okay?
I don't wanna talk
about it during dinner.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
Hey, Smooth.
Look, your old friend.
Son of a bitch.
Here we are, sir.
Yeah, listen.
You see the guy over here?
The four-eyed gentleman
with his nose
buried in the book?
Sir?
The guy with
the seat-cover sport jacket.
Yes, sir.
I wanna buy him a drink.
Yes, sir.
No, uh, I wanna
buy him dinner.
Very good, sir.
Chop, chop.
(Monica)
Mmm, generous!
Excuse me, sir,
but the gentleman
at the table opposite you
with the young ladies
would like you to
join him for dinner.
Really? I can't believe it.
Sell it, girls.
(Clifford)
I wonder what
the man could want.
Homosexual come-on, maybe.
No, he couldn't be gay,
not with all those
beautiful women.
And even if he is,
maybe they're not.
What harm in accepting
the man's hospitality?
But, no free lunch
in this world, say I.
I can thank him though.
Yes.
Yes, I'll thank him.
That's
the decent thing to do.
Uh, this is
most unexpected.
Do I know you?
Perhaps you were in
my Comp-Lit 101 class
at Monroe?
I don't believe so.
[Chinese accent]
Excuse me, I'm Jasmine...
And I'm totally
thoughtless.
Allow me to
introduce everyone.
This is Karen,
and I'm Smooth Walker.
This is Monica,
Hello.
Jasmine, of course,
and this is Thelma.
You are...
Uh, Clifford Skridlow.
My friends call me Cliff.
Clifford, oh, how cute.
Well, join us, Cliff.
Uh, well,
I-I've... I've already ordered...
Why don't I have
Mr. Skridlow's dinner
brought to this table?
Why don't you?
Great.
Here comes
that chair, Cliff.
Just slip right in.
We'll have
another fresh drink
for our new friend Cliff.
How very gracious
of you.
Can you tell us
anything at all about this
tandoori thing?
Oh, you've ordered
the tandoori?
Well, uh,
you're going to enjoy it.
It's... lt's really
a marvelous technique.
It's a miniature clay oven,
completely enclosed,
a marinade,
and the heat of the oven
and the enclosure on top
that keeps the juices in,
uh, and, uh, thus causes
the, uh, meat
to come out pink.
Ooh, I love it.
[Women laughing]
Thank you
for coming.
Thank you,
my good man.
I got it, honey.
Come on.
Come on.
[Sighing]
Fresh air gives
one a decided lift,
doesn't it?
Well, I'm off to
the Cinema Obscura.
It's the last night
of the Satyajit Ray
Pather Panchali trilogy.
I'd like to catch it.
Don't worry about it.
I got the whole thing
on videocassette.
Pather Panchali,
the whole trilogy,
Deep Throat,
E. T., you name it.
Hey...
Thank you, Diavolo, the door.
Wait, Boss,
this is the geek...
Yes, this is
Professor Clifford Skridlow.
He's an expert
on chivalry, honor,
literature,
Indian cuisine...
Don't forget power walking,
systems analysis,
rock climbing...
And what about
erotic adventure?
I never said that.
So, think about it.
[Smooth laughing]
Shall we be going then?
Come on.
(Karen)
Come on.
We'll have a wonderful time...
(Thelma)
Yeah.
And you look
like you could use
a little company, right?
(Karen)
Yeah. Get in.
Would you get
your ass in the car?
##[Super Freak

# Once you get her

Yeah.
Do you dance?
Not much.
Oh, go on,
you got that rhythm. Go on.
Show them
what you're made of.
Come on,
I know you wanna do it.
It'll be so much fun.
You look so
handsome in this jacket.
Well, I might as
well work off supper.
There you go.
Gangway,
hop to, coming through.
Oh, that's cute.
Hey, Smooth,
what are we being so
nice to this guy for?
Well, I'm, uh, thinking about
taking in a new partner.
Let's go mix it up.
# She's a super freak #
# Super freak #
# She's super-freaky ##
[all whooping]
Like Lord Wittgenstein
and monks
drinking wine and
the flagons were full.
Watch the water.
[Horn honking]
Beautiful, wait!
Traffic, stop, stop.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm gonna fire up
a fun log. Mmm?
(all)
Yeah.
Yeah.
It really doesn't
do anything to me,
and I've tried.
Oh, yeah! You're just
Mr. Natural, aren't you?
Let's get
high on life?
The body is a temple, huh?
Well, you could say
that actually, sure.
She just did.
Go on, try some.
That's not
gonna do it.
# Love, love #
# Love, love #
All the way
to the right?
[Muffled cries]
[Coughing]
Oh, boy!
Oh...
[sighing]
[All hooting]
Thank you.
(Smooth)
Get in there, file in. Wait
till you see this next place.
Come on.
Come to Mama.
(Smooth)
Okay, here we go.
Wake up, Diavolo.
Drive, my man.
Let's go, go, go!
What a great car.
[Crashing]
Forward, Diavolo, forward.
[Gagging]
[Grunting]
He was a real nut.
I read that.
I know.
He was mad.
Really?
Come on,
don't make him blush.
It'll make you
feel so good.
Ooh!
Hold it. Hold it.
# Hold him #
We're on a roll here.
Watch it, watch it.
# Hold him #
# Show him #
# Show him that it's real #
# Show him
that it feels good #
I can feel
my hair growing.
Hey, baby,
it's good dope.
No, it's not the dope.
It doesn't affect me.
Explain that.
[All giggling]
(Smooth)
Drink up, Cliff.
A new way of
looking at things, huh?
I guess so.
You're a marvelous...
You're a marvelous group.
Are we?
Very perceptive.
Thank you.
Welcome home.
Wow, look at this place!
It's positively vulgar!
You must be so
incredibly rich!
Look, your art collection,
it's on the...
Oh, I... You purposely...
Because... Chicago!
Your kind of town.
Yes!
Where am I?
You're right here.
Where's here?
Well, here is
where it's at.
Now, come on,
don't give me any of that
freshman philosophy crap.
I'm talking
existential being.
Well, of course you are,
gorgeous.
You're very pretty,
like a bright little bug.
A dragon!
Say, Boss, check it out.
You got my man
over here tripping.
Dude is tripping.
What'd you give...
Stay down at the front,
with the car.
Say what?
I thought you said
I could take the rest
of the night off, man.
Sure, but in the car.
Oh!
[Yells]
[Chuckling]
Look, what utterly
tasteless furnishings.
Cliff.
[Woman moaning]
[Clifford grunting]
[Coughing]
So, you're in
the entertainment business.
Well, you could call us
public servants.
Don't we look it?
You know, I think
Cliffie is a little tense.
Uh, perhaps a hot bath?
(women)
Oh, yeah.
[Laughs]
No, no, I don't think
it's tension,
l... I think it's more fatigue.
L... I really should be going.
It's... lt's far past my usual
bedtime.
And let's just
say I'm... I'm not tense.
Yes, you are.
I can feel it, Cliff,
right up in there.
[Groaning]
My lattisimus dorsi,
you're so right.
It's only natural
on a night
that could
change your life.
Ah, nothing's gonna
change my life.
My life is set.
What could possibly happen?
How'd you like to
come into this business?
The entertainment business?
Exactly.
All I wanna do is
share my good fortune,
my... my involvement
with other people,
my world.
Oh, I...
I don't know.
See, I have a business,
I teach comparative literature
at Monroe College.
I'm a full
assistant professor now.
My father is
chancellor of the college.
L... l... I'm committed.
Think about it, Cliffie.
Just think about it.
Your own business.
Your piece of
the American dream.
[Hookah bubbling]
A nice company pad,
the best employee roster
this side of heaven.
Thelma, Karen,
Monica, Jasmine.
Now, that's
entertainment.
And they'd all be
working for you.
All for you.
[Stammers]
It's all very sudden...
I have responsibilities...
l... l... I...
Well...
[clicking]
Soak!
Think about it.
Relax.
Enjoy.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Oh!
ETA to splashdown:
Two seconds!
[Screams]
[All giggling]
[All screaming]
[Sputtering]
You dark,
burnished thing, you!
[Laughing]
Oh, you beauties!
Ooh! Your legs are so
muscular for a teacher.
Do you exercise?
Yeah, as a teacher,
I stand a lot.
Listen, sweetheart,
do you think we can use
battery-operated
devices under water?
Yes! Use them.
[All laughing]
I'm gonna show
you how to play
"find the gunboat."
[Gasping]
[Women squealing]
This is the best time
I've ever had
in my entire life!
Do you hear me, world?
My entire life!
[Clifford laughing]
[Birds chirping]
You gonna make it, man?
Yeah, yeah, thank you,
I think so.
Thank you, thank you.
Take care, my brother.
[Shoes squishing]
Hello, Son.
Hello, Father.
That's a late night.
[Sighs]
I guess, a little.
Good morning, Clifford.
Breakfast anyone?
(Arthur)
No, none for me.
Oh, of course not.
You're probably gonna
starve yourself to death.
[Both chuckling]
What makes you think
that I'd take my own life?
Oh, I was speaking
figuratively, dear.
But these
financial statements...
Clifford, cash
your paycheck quickly.
Margaret! Mar... Mar...
Would you please excuse me?
That is private business
between the trustees and me.
Forget it,
everything's peachy...
Harmon Rousehorn,
I'm gonna call him
and tell him to
cancel his visit.
We don't need
his endowment check.
[Margaret laughing]
Don't you dare.
My God!
Oh! Honestly, some people
just can't take a joke.
I'm gonna water
my begonias.
##[Margaret humming]
Well, I would prefer
for you to hear it from me.
But without the
Rousehorn endowment check
this college can't even meet
its current payroll.
But we are getting the check.
I mean, Rousehorn's coming in
to present it himself.
It's a major endowment.
It's in the press.
Look, son, without
that check, Monday next
the banks are gonna
close this college down.
Close it down.
One hundred years
of scholarship
and public service
shot to shit.
I've gotta go up
and get some winks
before my 11:00 lecture.
You've got a 9:00.
Is today Wednesday?
(Arthur)
Yes, Wednesday.
I thought it was Thursday.
[Bell tolling]
[Students chattering]
Excuse me, please.
Thank you.
Morning.
(Clifford)
Ah-ah-ah. Places, please.
Let's begin. Sorry I'm late.
[Students groan]
We were discussing
the hero's role in chivalry
as exemplified by
the character of Lancelot,
based on Thomas Malory's
Le Morte d'Arthur.
Entranced by
Arthur's Queen Guinevere,
Lancelot,
a knight of impeccable virtue,
faces a crisis
as his idée fixe
confronts his libido.
Any comments?
Mr. Frankman,
what do you think
of Lancelot's crisis?
Well, I think
Lancelot was an idiot.
Mr. Frankman,
how long have you been
in the first-year program?
Four years.
[Students chuckling]
Uh, duty, selfless honor,
chastity, humility,
uh, purity,
a devotion to a greater good.
I mean, by now,
don't any of these things
mean anything to you?
[Clifford sighs]
All together now:
What is the chivalric ideal?
(students)
The chivalric ideal is one
of duty to a higher cause
in which purity and
chastity are virtues
and manly strength and honor
are devoted
to their preservation.
And justice for all.
[Police car siren wailing]
Just let it out! They'll
get to your real feelings.
How does it feel?
Hey, man, I feel lousy...
Lousy.
I feel shitty...
Hmm.
I feel pissed off...
Violent, hostile?
Yeah, a little.
Great! Hit me.
Hey, man, I can't do that.
Look, you can.
You want to.
You... You... You have to.
I need it.
Hey, man.
What's wrong with you?
You getting a little kinky?
'Cause if you are,
it's gonna cost you extra.
I learned that
from the girls.
They learned that from me
and that has
nothing to do with this!
Now, look, Diavolo, for once,
do what I tell you to do
and try to do it right!
Now, hit me!
Say, man, what's wrong
with you? You going crazy?
I can't hit you.
You want me to call a doctor?
I ain't hitting you, man.
Okay. I'll make it
real easy for you.
I got everything,
you got nothing, right?
I'm the boss,
you ain't jack shit!
I am white. I don't even
know what you are!
Say, man, I'm black!
All right,
then try to remember
that my grandfather
owned your grandfather!
Your mama!
[Groans]
That's good, Diavolo.
That's good!
Oh, my back!
Oh, your ass!
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Not the teeth.
You don't tell me
what to do.
You want me
to kick your ass?
Then I'm gonna kick your
white motherfucking ass!
(Smooth)
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
Hmm.
[Man chattering on TV]
Oh, nice.
Black eye, lacerations,
multiple contusions...
Hey, what'd you do,
try to roll a sailor?
[All laughing]
Doctor Detroit.
He's bad, Mom. Really bad.
Mom, I gotta get out of town.
Now, your heavies
can settle this shit.
Just leave old
Smooth out of it.
(Mom)
You mean that's it?
Couple of broken ribs,
you're ready to cave in?
Gee. With a partner like you,
who needs enemies?
Adi... Adios, Mom.
Believe me,
you deserve to get
every bit of your cash back.
It's just that
I don't have it.
See Doctor Detroit, he's...
[groans]
He's your man.
Oh, my God.
Give me that shit.
Are you kidding?
He's for real.
I gotta find out
more about this Doctor.
Hey, what's that black chick
who works for Smooth?
Um, Thelma.
Get her busted.
I wanna see just
how good this Doctor
takes care of his people.
She's busted.
Let's do it.
Look out, asshole.
Thank you, man,
thank you.
[Chuckling]
Oh, yes.
##[Music playing]
Okay, Mr. Finkelman.
Uh, we have you
one-way first class,
Air Togo to the Cook Islands,
then local service
to Rarotonga.
Are you sure you
want this just one-way?
Right, sweetheart,
one-way, no return.
(man #1)
In the financial briefing,
you'll see
that each person
has their own report
as well as what is theirs...
(man #2)
Now, Arthur, if we just...
Now, may I have
your attention, please,
to ltem 6 on the agenda
which is the alumni dinner?
As customary, we will be
at the Excelsior Hotel
in the Orchid Room.
Cliff will introduce
Harmon Rousehorn.
[Clifford snorts]
Cliff?
Cliff, may we have
your attention, please?
Oh, ahem...
I'm sorry, uh, go ahead, sir.
Uh, the president emeritus
will present
the honorary degree.
Uh, Mr. Rousehorn
will make a few brief remarks
and then present the college
with the endowment check
for the Harold Robbins Chair.
Are there any questions?
Will there be a fruit cup?
Yes.
Will there be
a choice of vegetables?
No.
Last year there
wasn't any fruit cup
[telephone ringing]
And the shrimp were off.
This year there
will be a fruit cup.
Uh, this is
Chancellor Skridlow.
(Jasmine)
Hello? Criff? Criff?
Uh, Cliff,
I believe this is for you.
Would you please
make it snappy, son?
Uh, this is Criff,
uh, Cliff.
Cliff, good morning.
I'm still tingling
from last night.
Oh, but something
terrible has happened.
You have to help me.
Um, uh um, M-M-Miss Wu,
I'm... I'm... I'm in a meeting,
uh, per... perhaps we can
discuss this in... in class.
(Monica)
Cliff...
(Karen)
Class, my ass. Give me that.
Excuse me, please.
Uh...
Uh, what is it?
Thelma's in jail
and Smooth's gone
so you gotta help us...
Give me that phone.
Hi, Cliff, it's me, Karen.
First things first,
You're gonna have to
get over here
as fast as you can
and help us out.
This is an emergency...
I've no time. Thanks.
I'm so sorry.
[Men mumbling]
Where were we?
Uh, now obviously
there is no need
to stress
the importance
of the Rousehorn endowment...
[telephone ringing]
Hello?
(Karen)
Hey, Cliff,
what's the big idea, anyway?
You know, after last night,
a person would think, well...
What, were you using us?
Uh, uh, listen, I'm in a very
important meeting right now
with the faculty of my college
including, uh, my father,
the Chancellor...
(Monica)
Cliff...
He's talking
about his father.
Shut up.
This is Monica, birthmark...
Oh. Excuse me.
[Men muttering]
[Clears throat]
Okay, now listen, I sent
Diavolo with the car...
Uh, yo,
is Cliff Skridlow here?
Cliff, what's happening?
Hey, man,
I'm double-parked outside.
Well, you'll just
have to wait.
What the hell is
going on here, anyway?
Uh, he just
got here.
Uh, I'm so... I'm so sorry
about these interruptions.
Are we still in session
or is this a coffee break?
No, we are still
in session.
We gotta go, bro.
I'm coming.
L... I'm coming.
I'll be there,
don't worry about a thing.
I'm... I'm on my way.
Vietnamese girl.
Distraught, distressed...
Uh, urgent, needs
immediate faculty counseling.
Uh, I'll be back.
[Police sirens wailing]
[Police radio chattering]
[Horns honking]
[People chattering]
"301."
"Robert. E.
Lee Davis-Jackson."
I don't wanna hear
any more about it!
Every time I turn around,
you're up here
in front of me
on a traffic violation!
And if it
happens one more time,
you're gonna be spending
your declining years
in the slammer!
Now, get out of here!
Next case.
[Sighs]
A southern tyrant.
Uh, pardon me,
are you looking for a lawyer?
Uh, no.
Well, uh, would you like to
discuss it over a drink?
I know a wonderful cozy
little bar across the street.
No, thank you, I have
business with the court.
Thanks anyway.
Hmm.
[Crunching]
[Paper rustling]
Well, excuse me.
Sir, I have a business
proposition for you.
Mmm-hmm.
Would you be willing
to, uh, part with certain
elements of your
unique wardrobe
for a cash retainer?
[Chuckles]
Does that mean
sell my clothes?
Nah.
Lf, uh, look, i-if there were
thoughts in that direction,
I mean, what sort of offer
are we kind of talking about?
Well, I wouldn't
want to insult you...
You can't insult me.
You see, I'm a lawyer.
Talk best price.
(judge)
I have repeatedly
warned counsel
not to provoke
the court with all this...
Is this
Department 20 and one?
[Shushing]
Step aside, lackey,
or you'll be eating my boot!
[All murmuring]
What is going on?
Exactly, your honor,
what is going on?
When a flower of the South,
a decent girl with
a beautiful good family
is arrested
on her way home from
her niece's confirmation
and booked and incarcerated
like a common
woman of the streets.
I'm talking
about Thelma Cleland!
Of the Cleland
Parish Clelands
of Bay St. Luc, Louisiana.
Excuse me!
Where our father
Colonel Judge Bryant Cleland
presides over
the Cleland County
Fifth Circuit bench.
I demand that you release
this girl right now
or you'll all taste
the business end
of a buggy whip!
Bailiff...
Yes, sir.
Get your ass
over here!
You got a case number?
Yes, I do.
Two, zero, five, six, nine,
"A," Alpha. "R," Ranger.
(bailiff)
I'll get it!
Now, just exactly
what is your relationship
to the arrestee?
Uh, well, sir,
the young woman is my sister!
I know you can believe
that the family honor
is at stake here.
You strike me
as a gentleman, sir.
Surely you must understand.
Why, of course, I understand.
My people were
related to Jefferson Davis,
on my mother's side.
I knew it!
I knew it, indeed, I knew it!
A son of the South.
Son of what?
O-Of the South, sir.
The confederacy!
(bailiff)
Uh, your honor.
What?
Loitering with intent
to commit prostitution,
lewd behavior, soliciting
for an unlawful act.
Bail at $350, your honor.
I can't believe my ears!
This is an outrage!
Let me see that thing!
This is outrageous,
ridiculous! Let me see that.
Why,
I demand satisfaction!
Get the arresting
officer in here!
I will tar and
feather the scalawag!
Now hold on, Mr. Cleland!
Hold on!
I can release your sister
on her own recognizance
and dismiss this case
in the interests of justice.
Well, thank you. It would
serve my family well.
Sir,
we'd be very grateful.
Do you like shrimp?
Indeed, I do.
You can come down
to Bay St. Luc,
we'll cook you up
a whole mess of shrimp.
We got some
shrimp in that family.
How about Tampa?
Thelma!
Bud!
Come on, honey,
we are going home.
And not a moment
too soon.
(judge)
Case dismissed.
I can't tell you
the indignities
I suffered here.
Thank you,
my father thanks you.
You're entirely welcome.
That girl is colored!
[All gasping]
Nobody colored me,
I was born this way!
Come here, baby.
That's all right.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
See you later.
Diavolo could have told me
you were the black person.
Bailiff,
I want that man charged
with impersonating a cracker!
Yes, sir.
That was just incredible!
I can't believe
you did that!
How did this
happen to you?
I was busted.
It was an occupational...
I mean, an occasional hazard.
Come on, Cliff, I mean...
Impossible.
It was never agreed,
never mentioned,
never discussed!
Smooth was very clear
about the whole thing.
He said, "I will be gone
two or three days
and Cliff's in charge."
Have you ever even heard
of Doctor Detroit?
You see, Skridlow,
this guy's
got to be a big man.
He's got to be cool.
He's a partner, like Mom,
but only worse, brother!
Mom? A-A-Are you saying
someone's mother
is involved in all this?
Yes!
[All chuckling]
Oh, boy.
Hey, check upstairs.
Okay, Mom.
This is nice.
This is real nice.
A gal could be
real comfy in here.
Uh...
l... I don't... don't believe
that you're welcome here.
L... I think that
you'd better leave.
Quiet!
Who is this twerp, huh?
Doctor Detroit?
Well, I wouldn't even
venture...
Don't bother.
Oh, my little stable
is top drawer, high quality.
Am I gonna enjoy
running these bitches.
Hey, we don't
work for you.
We never have
and we never will!
Oh, you just sit down!
[All clamoring]
Now listen, Smooth's gone,
which means
your ass is mine, girlie.
Uh, uh, uh, p-pardon me
for just... just a second.
L... I just... just
wanna clarify things here.
[Stammering]
Are you actually saying
that these girls are...
They're hookers
and whores.
[Both laughing]
Hey. Hey, I like this.
Take it. Get this thing here.
Uh, forget that.
Oh. Hey, I like that.
Ooh, ain't that a beauty?
Ooh, I like this. Here.
[All screaming]
Hey! Okay, now,
I want you to stop this!
Right this instant!
Let's see what else
I can find.
I mean that.
[Girls squealing]
You'll stop!
You'll take your dirty
mitts off the fixtures!
Those are Doctor's orders!
Doctor Detroit.
The bad man
from Michigan, himself.
I am his executive assistant.
You touch any of us
and his measure of revenge
will be most swift
and horrible,
I can assure you of that!
Damn, Skridlow,
talk some shit!
[Chuckling]
I'm shivering.
Now, come on, boys,
finish things up
and then you can
bust junior up, here,
for laughs.
I warn you!
I am extensively read
in White Crane Kung Fu
and Hapkido!
[Snarling]
Right, all right,
get down, Skridlow.
Okay, okay,
don't get your balls
in an uproar.
We can always talk.
Well, then talk!
Well, not to you.
To the boss.
Me and Doctor Detroit.
Face to face.
Uh, you and Doctor Detroit.
Okay, fine.
I'll set up a meeting...
All right.
...between you
and Doctor Detroit.
Uh, tomorrow night,
at the 126th St. Graveyard.
At midnight.
[Chuckling]
Midnight?
The graveyard?
That's kinda dramatic,
ain't it?
Well, that's my offer.
Take it or leave it,
Bigfoot!
[Snarling]
Come on now, cool it!
Cool it!
Get down, Skridlow,
with your Hapkido self.
All right!
Yeah, brother,
show 'em what you can do.
Well, that's it!
That's my offer.
Tomorrow night,
126th St. Graveyard, midnight.
No excuses. No substitutions!
I don't talk
to flunkies!
Now, I'll meet
with your Doctor,
and we'll settle
this shit together!
Well then, fine. If our
business here is concluded,
I'll kindly ask you to leave.
Leave!
Okay, come on.
Get out!
Tomorrow!
Get out of here,
all of you.
Come on, boys.
[Clifford yelling]
Out! Scat! Be gone! Raus!
And don't let the door hit you
and your collective asses
on the way out!
All right, Skridlow!
[All clamoring]
That Hapkido shit
came in handy, brother!
You were wonderful.
You were a hero.
(Jasmine)
Our knight
in shining armor.
So macho.
Umm.
You really think so?
(all)
Oh, yeah.
Look, but, w-w-w-what were
they saying earlier
about... about you girls?
I mean, c-c-could it
possibly be...
Oh, come on, Cliff.
You're a big boy.
It's a job.
We're working girls.
And believe me,
honey, we are the best.
[All agreeing]
You are professionals.
And Smooth was your
[stammering]
Pi-pi-pi...
Does that change anything,
Cliff?
[Sighing]
All right, don't tell me
any more.
I will be your protector,
but I won't be your manager,
your agent,
[stammering]
Nor your pi-pi-pi...
I can't even say it.
Anyway, it won't be me.
It will be Doctor Detroit.
Now, for now,
we just maintain,
we go on as before
until Smooth returns.
The Doctor will take care
of everything.
But above all,
don't tell anybody
about Doctor Detroit,
nor what I am doing.
Nobody.
[All chattering]
I will try.
Absolutely.
This Doctor Detroit is bad.
B-A-D, man.
He's badder than
Larry Holmes.
He's badder than
Joe Frazier.
Badder than
Ken Norton.
(all)
Oh.
Badder than Jerry Quarry.
He's even badder than
Mr. Clean!
Mom, Mom,
it's all over the streets.
What?
Doctor Detroit's
movin' in.
They say we are
movin' out.
Oh, the hell, you say!
I haven't even
met the Doctor.
[Slurping]
But when I do,
[glass breaking]
He's dog meat.
Yeah.
I must do the decent thing.
[Crickets chirping]
It's such
an indecent profession.
You enjoyed it,
though, didn't you?
Yes, but I didn't
have to pay.
What about this
Doctor Detroit?
What about him?
Somebody has to
do the work.
Better him than you.
You? Me?
[Sighs]
Sleep on it.
Yeah.
Okay, sleep on it.
[Owl hooting]
[Whispering]
Cliff?
Oh, oh!
Shh!
Be quiet.
[Clattering]
Jasmine?
What... What... What are you
doing here? This is my room.
Uh, Jasmine,
where are you taking me?
I'm still half-asleep.
Quick, quick.
Are... Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?
Ooh, Ulysses S.
Motherfucking Grant.
Welcome to the neighborhood,
brother.
Ooh, Cliff,
check out this money, man.
Cash, money.
L... I know, but... but where did
all this money come from?
The old-fashioned way.
We earned it!
But...
Cliffie, there are
other fringe benefits.
Uh, uh...
Like samples.
Oriental baths.
I don't...
Swedish massages.
French lessons.
I know how to speak...
Exotic, erotic,
juicy adventures.
It's ridiculous!
I mean, what would men
of real virtue do
if they were in my position?
I'll tell you one thing,
they wouldn't sit around
wearin' those pajamas.
(all)
Ooh. Hey!
Here's your hat, Daddy,
I picked it out
especially for you.
I'm dreaming.
[Men chanting]
The wages of sin.
The wages of sin.
Give us the money
and let us come in.
The wages of sin.
The wages of sin.
Give us the money
and let us come in.
Judge not, Sonny,
lest ye be judged.
Mark well the wages of sin!
[All clamoring]
Come home.
Father, I want...
I want you and your... your
parental guidance.
I need moral support.
Father, can't you do
anything to stop this?
Yay! Ooh, ooh,
ah, ah, ah.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh, ah,
ooh, ah, ooh, ah.
Ah, um, mmm, mmm, um.
Clifford, I heard
you had some money.
Give it to the college.
No more bucks from Uncle Sam.
It's gotta come
from someplace.
It's filthy money! It's money
from depraved sources!
See what money
pleasure brings?
See what pleasure
money brings?
Thanks, my man.
I can see where
you're coming from.
She's all yours.
This is fun!
My mother's not for sale!
It's all for sale!
All for sale! All for sale!
Not my mother!
Not for the college!
Not for any money!
Not for anybody!
Not for anything!
Not my mother!
Mother, stop, please!
[All chanting]
All for sale! All for sale!
Don't go, Mother! Stop!
Listen, Mother, stop!
[Screaming]
No! No, I will not
sell my own mother!
Of course
you wouldn't, dear.
But it's a sweet thought.
[Birds chirping]
Huh.
[Sighing]
Anybody care to comment
on the concept
of, uh,
death before dishonor?
[Whispering]
Comments, anyone?
No? Good!
[Bell ringing]
(girl)
Come on, let's go.
[All chattering]
Oh, get some sleep...
Edison used to nap
in his lab for two hours,
Napoleon fought a war on four.
Greater men than me
have had less sleep.
Oh.
Oh.
(Arthur)
Son.
Oh.
Oh, son, I'm glad
you stopped by
before leaving.
Leaving?
You're... You're going
into the city.
Harmon Rousehorn's train
is arriving at 11:00.
And you have to arrange
for the caterers
for the welcome dinner here
tomorrow night,
and you have to pick him up
at the station.
Here. Uh, take the Buick
and, uh,
get yourself together.
You're a sight.
[Sighing]
[Birds chirping]
Rousehorn. Train.
Edison. Nap. Two hours.
Hey, Skridlow,
what's happening, man?
Uh, uh...
L-L-L-Look, where you goin'?
Talk. Khyber's.
Union Station. The train.
Rousehorn. Sleep.
What you talkin' about, man?
Wait, you got a meeting
with Mom tonight
at some graveyard.
Remember? You made the date,
so you got to keep it.
Where's Doctor Detroit, man?
Where's Doctor Detroit?
Doc-Doctor Detroit?
Yeah.
Doctor Detroit!
I'll make this phone call.
I'll take care of everything.
(female operator)
Information.
What city, please?
Yes, for the city of Chicago.
Number of Mom's
Limousine Service.
Thank you.
[Clattering]
Yes, I'd like to
speak to Mom.
(Mom)
Hello, yeah, yeah,
this is Mom.
[Nasal voice]
Oh, uh...
Uh, hey, hello, Mom.
Yeah.
Uh, this is the Doctor.
Doctor?
Doctor Detroit.
Yeah. I-I-I'm sorry
about the static.
I-I'm... I'm on the mobile phone
in my car right now.
And, uh, I'm on my way
down l-94.
Yeah, uh, yes, I came
all the way down
from Detroit.
I'm not very happy about it.
Now, look, Mom,
about our little meeting
tonight at midnight, I...
Um, i-it's not midnight.
It's not midnight?
No.
Uh, I know he said that,
but I can't make it
at midnight!
Of course, it's short notice.
Now, you look! I mean,
uh, uh,
look here, i-i-i-it's your
little pink plump rump
in the ringer, not mine,
so you make it 9:00, or not!
Bite it, buster!
Yeah, well,
you bite it yourself, Mom!
Bye.
Say, man,
how you gonna
get away with this playin'
on that uh, uh, uh, uh,
shit, huh?
Fear not, Sancho.
Say no more!
We must ask ourselves
what would El Zorro do
in a situation like this.
Or The Man of La Mancha?
Strategy. Purity. Bravery.
I am many.
I am one.
Yeah, you're one
crazy individual
human being, man.
Come on!
(Clifford)
Oh, oh, lift me up!
That! I want that!
(Diavolo)
What do you want
that thing for?
[Sighing]
Right.
This is the graveyard
we agreed upon.
Um, everybody,
just, uh,
stay in the car.
[Crickets chirping]
[Creaking]
[Sighing]
From inside
the jouster's tents,
the sound of the armorers
accomplishing the knights.
Busy hammers
closing rivets up,
give dreadful note
of preparation.
Damn,
he won't show!
Sure he will.
I'll give that son of a bitch
just another five minutes.
And then what, Mom?
Well, I'll wait some more.
I got all night
to kill his ass!
[Grunting]
[Clifford nasally]
Uh, all right, now.
Which one of you is Mom?
[Coughing]
Punctuality is a virtue,
my good madam.
Let's chew the fat.
Just what is that
supposed to mean?
Oh, nothing personal,
Love Chunks,
but can we get to it?
You know, I hate to come down
from Wayne County.
I have businesses in Lansing.
I have muffler shops,
chicken chains.
I got slums
to collect the rent from.
I have
a chiropractic practice.
I make adjustments
to the human spine!
And this little trip
has cut far too much
into my professional time!
I figured that since you're
hustlin' my turf,
we should talk.
I run this town.
[Metallic clanking]
Ah, ah, lurking in the dark.
Nasty things. Come out!
Okay, fellas. Come on.
Come out.
[Clifford mumbling]
Come on out here.
Yeah, that's right.
Out here where... where
the Doctor can see you.
Lighten up, lighten up,
come on, Skridlow.
Be cool, man. Be cool.
Don't blow it, man.
(Mom)
You wanna move in on me
without permission,
without consideration?
You gotta pay!
The Doctor doesn't pay.
That's it?
The Doctor doesn't pay
and he doesn't worry.
Now, Mom,
if you want trouble,
I am talking
about scorched earth,
no survival,
wholesale destruction.
Calm down.
Please help me.
I wanna live.
Oh, my God!
Body bags and fire.
Trouble.
Then you just
keep comin' on!
You don't know
what trouble is, jerk-off!
Mom, I am going to
rip off your head
and shit down your neck.
Kill him!
[Yelling]
[Bullets ricocheting]
Get after him!
You go there!
[Girls screaming]
[Guns cocking]
Don't shoot!
We were on our way
to Leon's for some ribs
and he was hitchhiking.
We don't even know
this cat, man, he's crazy.
[Moaning]
Get out of here! Go on!
Hey, guys, hey, stop!
I, uh...
[yelling]
Uh, I'm Clifford Skridlow!
L... I teach school!
L... I don't even know
these girls!
I met them at a restaurant!
I have nothing
against you personally!
Jesus, they're serious!
They're serious!
Oh, God!
[Yelling]
Oh, God.
Whoa!
[Laughing]
Yeah.
Nothing can destroy
the Doctor!
Hey, come on, get him,
get him, get him.
Out of the way, knave.
[Grunting]
The battle rages on!
Run for your lives! Run!
Mom, you'll never
catch me! Never!
Run away! Run away!
Stop him! Come on!
Oh, God, what have I done
to deserve this?
[Engine revving]
[Crickets chirping]
[Clanking]
What the hell? What's this?
Hey! What the hell you doin'?
What the hell...
I've got you now,
Mom!
What the hell?
Here we go,
Love Chunks!
Oh, yes, this one's
on the Doctor.
[Snickering]
Where we going?
Come on, this isn't funny.
I don't wanna hear you
anymore.
(Mom)
We can make a deal!
Let's make a deal.
Come on, now.
(Carson)
Mom!
Let me down!
(Clifford)
Good night, Mom!
Oh, this man is...
[clicking]
[Mom screaming]
[Clanking]
(all)
Yeah, come on, Clifford.
Drive! Drive!
Nothing can stop us!
(Johnny)
This will stop them!
Charge!
[Women screaming]
Onward to Union Station!
[Yelling]
[All cheering]
(man over PA system)
Arriving on Track 14
from St. Louis.
Well, he's got to be there,
Harmon.
He left here hours ago.
What's the matter,
dear?
Clifford's late
and Rousehorn's pissed!
You, uh, you're missed,
uh, Harmon.
I said that we miss you
very much!
Arthur, take it easy.
I'll be there.
Mister, you want a taxi?
Are you a taxi?
No, jerk-off, I'm a person,
but I do drive a taxi.
It's right outside.
Can you take me
to Monroe College?
Sure thing. Hey, Dietrich,
I got a customer!
(Dietrich)
I'm coming.
[Women chattering]
Mr. Rousehorn!
(all)
Mr. Rousehorn!
Okay, let's try again now.
For the 200th time
you got to the train station
and...
And he wasn't there,
I looked everywhere.
Then where is he?
And where is
the endowment check
for the college?
Father, I haven't
the foggiest idea.
I really don't know.
Boys, you've been
through this all morning.
Now, have some breakfast.
No, no, no.
Not until I know
that Rousehorn is safe
and that check
is safe with him.
Margaret, I feel that
you don't understand.
We have no cash flow.
Without that check,
we are over, through,
finished, forget it!
Eighty-sixed, no more,
history, color it gone!
Don't help.
Oh, don't... don't you help.
Oh, my God, now,
what is it?
Well, it's the police.
See, he's dead.
Oh, I hope they found
the check.
Oh, it's all right,
darling. Everything's
going to be fine.
Come on, now.
[Police radio chattering]
Harmon, my heavens,
what happened?
Well, thank god
you're safe.
He said he was
on his way here.
So this is where
we brought him.
Oh, you need
some hot tea.
I kept the case.
[Sighing]
The check is safe.
I need a shower.
Uh, I'm sorry, sir,
but I've got to have
that blanket back.
That's a city blanket,
I signed for it.
Well, listen,
there's no need, uh,
to linger out here.
Uh, welcome to Monroe.
You are in the guest room.
(Rousehorn)
All I know is
I need a shower.
Well, you are certainly
dressed for one.
Now, tell me all about it.
How did they get
your pants off?
One leg at a time.
Of course.
Did they molest you?
Did you struggle?
I want all the details!
Only a benevolent deity
could have prevented him
from losing that check.
Now, after dinner,
he is gonna feel
so much better.
What time are the caterers
coming here?
Caterer?
The caterers
for the welcome dinner.
Here, tonight.
Rousehorn, half the faculty.
Indian food.
The Khyber Restaurant.
Don't you dare tell me!
Did you neglect...
No! No, no, no! No, no!
It's totally under control,
Dad. Everything is totally
and absolutely under control.
The catering, uh,
the chapatis,
pappadums, raita...
Ah, ha.
Got the curry, not to worry.
Bye.
[Moaning]
Look out, gentlemen, please.
Excuse me.
Coming through here!
[People chattering]
Gangway!
Coming through,
coming through,
please look out!
(Monica)
Cliff, what is it?
Catering!
Khyber Restaurant.
I forgot to do it!
I had to do it,
and I didn't do it!
I had seconds,
minutes, hours.
It's not done!
Look. Just relax,
okay?
Now, what is
the problem?
I lost Rousehorn,
I've got these term papers
to correct.
The college is on the verge
of bankruptcy,
my eyes can't focus,
my tongue tastes like
a skid mark,
I need some sleep.
Okay.
All right.
So you sleep, okay.
Edison survived on
two hours of sleep a night.
He took catnaps
in his lab.
Right.
All right.
Uh, catnaps, Edison,
two hours, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna sleep.
This is good. Sleep.
What do you think I should do
about these papers?
Give them all a "B."
That's all they
deserve anyway.
(Karen)
Hello?
Hello, Karen?
Hi, Monica, what's up?
What? He needs catering?
Arrangements?
Honey, "catering"
is my middle name.
Karen Catering Blittstein.
Sure.
I put two sisters through
gorgeous... gorgeous weddings
and I'm not talking
no cocktail franks
and miniature knishes,
neither.
Karen, shush!
Will you just
take care of it?
I'll get there
as soon as I can.
Okay, bye. I love you.
Shit.
What?
I don't have time to cook.
I'm gonna have to
improvise something.
This is
refreshing medication.
[Laughs]
Now, then,
that Harold Robbins Chair.
It's... lt's quite
an endowment, huh?
More than a penny
and less than
the national debt.
[Laughs]
Now, then, uh, like,
what amount are we talking?
I mean, I don't mean for you
to be specific...
I mean, just, generally,
in round numbers
what amount are we
talking about?
Just about?
For that, Arthur, you'll have
to wait until tomorrow.
I wanna treasure the look
on everyone's face
when our corporate generosity
is made public.
Absolutely.
I couldn't agree more.
[Telephone ringing]
(Clifford)
Oh, help, help.
Oh, I'm buried alive.
[Clifford grunts]
Let me out.
[Telephone ringing]
Hello?
(woman)
Cliff, where are you?
It's 7:30.
What time is it?
7:30.
It is?
Yes.
I'm coming.
I'll be right there. I'm gone.
Hurry up.
(woman)
I had no idea...
(Arthur)
Son. Uh... Uh, son, before you
change your clothes...
Skridlow.
Hello, Fulsom.
How are you?
That boy just
work, work, work.
Harmon, you don't know my son,
Clifford, do you?
He's one of the bright stars
of our English Department.
We've met.
Not on time, but we've met.
This morning, Father,
remember?
I-I'm so sorry about
last night, Harmon,
um, Mr. Rousehorn,
for missing your train...
It's in the past.
It is totally
forgotten and forgiven.
Let's just say
it's in the past.
Oh, I just know this is
gonna be a lively evening.
Oh, Clifford,
those girls are wonderful.
You certainly have
everything under control.
Girls?
(Thelma)
I think I'll take
the red caviar
and put it in
the round plate.
You think they'll
like that, honey?
W-What's going on here?
What's this?
Do you have any idea
how college faculty members
[telephone rings]
Eat on what we get paid?
A free meal is like honey
to a bear to these people.
They'll wanna eat enough
to hibernate on.
They're animals.
L... I mean, where'll we get
enough Indian food
to feed all of them?
Swami Diavolo's
finger-lickin'
Hindu fried chicken,
my friend Skridlow.
The rest, as my people say,
is up to karma.
Don't worry, Cliffie.
Jesus Christ, Karen,
you said this was curry.
This is not curry.
Thelma, it will be.
Will you calm down?
Cliff, go upstairs
and shower and change
and put something on
that's nice.
Look a little GQ,
would you?
Monica, go outside
and schmooze with the people.
Right, sarge.
Okay. Thelma, come here.
I'm gonna show you.
Take the o-olive
and the pimento,
make happy faces, okay?
I like that.
Good. Okay, here we go.
Of course, that was in the
Herbert Hoover Administration
which in some ways is similar
to what we have today.
Oh, Margaret, I fail to see
any similarity at all.
She's just kidding, Henry.
She's a real kidder.
(Rousehorn)
And I was reduced
to my underwear.
It's been downhill
ever since.
Oh, my goodness.
You know, you look
very tired, Mr. Rousehorn.
You know, wealth and power
have a way of robbing
a man of his energies,
don't they?
That's very perceptive
of you, Monica.
Very perceptive.
I hear we're having
Indian food.
I certainly hope so.
Chapatis, huh?
Well, l... I guess they've got
a few of those laid in.
Hello. Won't you
excuse us, please.
You happy, gorgeous flower?
We're having
a nice affair here.
Hi, how are you?
Nice to see you.
It's fine, but I'm... I'm
worried about the meal.
Wait till you see
the entertainment.
What?
Jasmine, enter.
##[Music playing]
[Laughs]
Cheers!
[People exclaiming]
Hi, Cliff.
Oh, my!
Oh.
[Laughs]
Uh, she's... she's... she's...
She's terrific. Come on.
Oh, you're ready.
I'm ready.
Okay, you set?
Set.
All right. Fire!
[All scream]
Be careful now. Hold on.
There's a fire! Fire!
Don't panic!
What are you doing?
Stop it.
Clifford,
what are you doing, man?
Stop it, please. Cliff.
Leave the arrangements
to me, would you?
This shit is so unique,
they're gonna love it.
They're gonna love this shit.
I panicked, I'm sorry.
I panicked.
It's okay, it's okay.
Just none of us
eat it, all right.
[All applauding]
##[Playing]
Your dinner is now served.
Come on, everybody.
[All chattering]
Hmm. Not bad.
Beats fruit cup.
Isn't it marvelous having
so many educated talents
all in one place?
Is she Indian?
I think so.
Mahatma Gandhi
never had it so good.
Truly. Of course,
he wasn't that
big an eater anyway.
[Both laughing]
That's funny.
Oh, sahib,
follow me, brother.
[Chattering]
This is great.
This is tremendous.
They're buying it.
You pulled it off.
I can't thank you enough.
Hey, no problem, Skridlow.
Thank me in the car, okay?
What do you mean
in the car?
We have to go in to town.
What? Not me.
I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't slept
in days, Diavolo.
Listen, Cliff, we don't have
much time, okay.
The word is on the street.
You have to
make an appearance,
because the Doctor goes public
in about one hour.
Are you crazy?
No, man, you're crazy.
You invented the dude,
not me.
So, I guess I'll catch you
in the car, brother.
Oh, come on,
everyone's talking about
how you stopped Mom.
Doctor Detroit has to be
on the scene, right?
(Diavolo)
He has to.
That's the end of it.
Uh, say, man,
put this shit on.
Props are in the bag.
Oh, terrific. Bag.
I must say, though, ladies,
you have given me
the most extraordinary week
of my life.
Oh, sweet.
Really.
Oh, man, you know,
you're gonna do good out here
in this city with
that wig and metal hand.
Lime-green pants.
Duty.
Honor.
And responsibility.
Hey, be the Doctor,
baby.
##[Music playing]
Doctor, my man,
give me five, man.
I'll give you $20
and then you can
keep the change.
[All clamoring]
See you at the Players Ball,
my man, huh?
All right. All right.
That was great.
What's the Players Ball?
Nothing, nothing.
Be cool, be cool.
I heard you wiped Mom out.
How did you do it?
You might say I
rearranged her front end.
[Women clamoring]
You know, you'll be king
of the Players Ball?
Ain't no doubt about it.
You're beautiful. Terrific.
All right. What is
the Players Ball
they keep talkin' about?
It's tomorrow night, honey.
That's okay, I'll protect you.
Tomorrow night?
I have a prior engagement.
I can't go. I can't go.
Oh, no. Where is it?
Somebody picks the place
and we all show up there.
It's a subcultural event,
sweetheart.
It's our responsibility
to be there.
Oh, I can't be there.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
[Women scream]
Grab him.
What is...
Dinner.
Come on, wake him up.
Give him air.
Tomorrow... Tomorrow night
is... is the college
alumni dinner.
Where?
At the Excelsior Hotel,
I have to be there.
I don't know where or what
your Players Ball is,
but I simply cannot be
in two places at once.
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
We'll take care of everything.
Now, how are we
gonna do that?
Shh.
(Karen)
Loosen his belt.
(Thelma)
Karen, get your mind
out of the gutter.
Oh, Jesus Christ, do you think
this is gonna work?
Sure, it'll work. Sure.
This is Ed here.
Your dime, go ahead.
Yo, Eddie.
Yeah.
What's happenin'?
This is Diavolo.
Oh, go ahead, Diavolo.
Listen, Eddie,
if the Doctor is king,
he chooses the place
where he wants
to be crowned.
Well, it's gonna go down?
This is it, right?
Uh-huh.
Don't jive me man?
I'll tell you what
it's going to be.
Uh, the Excelsior Hotel.
Excelsior Hotel.
That's downtown.
Is that right?
You're familiar
with the area.
Well, I'll ask around, man.
Yeah.
Later on.
The Doctor will be there.
Better be.
Later.
All right.
The Doctor's "A" Team.
First class.
Top of the line.
Come on, let's get ready.

(crowd)
Doctor Detroit.
Pardon me.
Uh, uh, excuse me.
Skridlow! Hey, man,
I gotta talk to you.
We gotta...
Excuse me. Clifford, I see
that your friend is here.
Does that mean you'll
be leaving us again?
No, absolutely not.
My duty is to my home,
my family,
the college, my job,
and to you, sir.
He is upsetting
the guests.
Will you get him
out of here?
Oh! Sue and Lloyd Miller.
Can you believe this noise?
You can't even think.
You have to
get out of here.
You're going to
ruin everything.
I have to talk to you.
Hey, man, watch out, man.
You been drinkin'?
Do you hear those people
over there?
They wanna see the Doctor.
[Sighs]
I can't do it.
I can't leave.
I've got to
introduce Rousehorn.
He's going to give
money to the college.
You've got to, man.
There are four beautiful women
depending on you.
The Doctor has
got to be there.
Look, there is no Doctor.
There is if you
believe in him, brother.
[Exhales]
All right, quick,
before I change my mind.
(Diavolo)
Straight through
the kitchen door.
But hurry it up, man.
(Diavolo)
Cliff, put the hair on.
To the right.
If my parents ever see me,
they'll disown me.
Check out the lining
in this jacket.
You can wear it
inside out.
Do the pants match?
No, they won't work.
The lining's purple.
Looks just fine.
Come on, move it.
Move it, man. Come on.
This is so insane.
I don't know how you
made me do this.
Those underwear
look nice, man.
How about these
tuxedo pants?
They were
Grandpa Skridlow's.
He had sensitive legs.
He had to have satin
near his skin at all times.
Yeah, let's move, move.
The glasses? The glasses?
You got 'em. Right here.
(man)
Hey, you boys,
get out of the kitchen!

Doctor Detroit!
Doctor, ooh-ooh,

Thank you. Thank you.
I'm... I'm... I'm
so, so very touched
and pleased to be
honored in this way.
But, unfortunately,
I have business
in... in another part
of the hotel,
a prior commitment, actually
a small chiropractic service
I was supposed to perform.
But, if anybody is
akin here tonight
it is this man,
Mr. "Try Me."
Mr. "Please, Please, Please."
Mr. "This is a Man's World."
I give you
the hardest-working man
in show business,
ladies and gentlemen,
James Brown.

Hi, Mom.
##[Humming]
I just saw someone we know.
Boys.
[Exhales]
How are the hors d'oeuvres?
[Speaking Italian]
I'm so glad
you could join us, Cliff.
Thanks, I'm so glad
I could make it.
Hey, fruit cup.
I'll have one.
Thank you.
No, I mean you,
fruit cup.
Mom wants to
see you right now.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen?
[Glasses tinkling]
Please, your attention.
Your attention, please.
Faculty and alumni of
Monroe College, and guests.
Tonight is a very
special night for the college.
He's introducing him
before the entrée.
And, uh, to explain why,
I'll introduce our
distinguished guest of honor,
himself an alumnus of Monroe,
a philanthropist,
Doctor of Humane Letters
and Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman of
Rousehorn Consolidated
Industries,
Mr. Harmon Rousehorn.
[Audience applauding]
You introduced him
before the entrée.
Excuse me.
And, dear friends,
our college...
Look out, watch it.
[People exclaiming]
##[Music playing]
# Yeah #
(Diavolo)
Hey, Doctor,
what's happening, baby?
What's movin' out there?
I'm proud of you.
It's imperative that we leave
these premises immediately.
Why? The party's
just getting started.
Say, man,
what's the matter?
Why do we have to leave?
(all)
Oh, mom?
That's why.
Well, who do you think?
No one starts
this party without me.
Get the son of a bitch.
(girl)
Hey, what's going on?
[All shouting]
Look out! Doctor on call.
Emergency house call.
Emergency!
Doctor on call!
Look out!
Out of the way! Move!
I'm gonna
kick your ass!
I warn you,
I'm a chiropractor.
I will use
my skills negatively.
There are radioactive
isotopes in this bag.
Stay away!
You're dead!
You're mine, Detroit.
You're mine.
[All screaming]
En garde, madame!
I have you now at
a supreme disadvantage.
[Laughs]
Like hell, you have.
You're crazy.
[Grunts]
Are you nuts?
And now, in closing,
I'd like to present to you
on behalf of Rousehorn
Consolidated Industries,
this meager endowment.
[All applauding]
I'm so nervous.
Clifford should be here.
Well, this is a, uh,
this is a great,
great day for...
[both screaming]
I defy you, woman.
[Screams]
Excuse me. Excuse me,
this is a private party.
(man)
Who... Who are these people?
$500 on the Doctor, huh?
Excuse me, excuse me,
this is a private...
[all clamoring]
[All exclaim]
It's Clifford.
Oh, my God. No.
Yes, Mother. It's me.
[All clamoring]
Okay, finish me.
I'm not afraid to die.
Go ahead.
And I am fortunate in battle
and merciful in victory.
Madam,
I'll let the room decide.
My good people,
what'll it be?
(all)
No.
So be it.
You're finished
in this town, Mom.
Through, banished,
exiled in your community.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Doctor is
a compassionate man!
Throw this trash bag out,
and never let her
darken Cook County again.
[All booing]
Shut up.
My arm! My arm!
[All booing]
I'll be back.
My good people, l... I pray,
a moment of your
attention here, please.
$1 million.
And I thought
you were cheap.
I didn't mean cheap.
(Margaret)
Clifford, you've made us
so proud.
L... I thank you, sir,
and... and the college
thanks you,
and my parents thank you.
And the Doctor thanks you.
But the Doctor is no more.
[Clicks]
He existed only to
banish an evil presence.
Let it be known to all here
that the damsels
whom Mom would've
held captive are free.
My ladies, Karen,
Thelma, Monica, Jasmine,
you are beholden to none.
Diavolo, my trusted comrade,
perhaps we may ride again.
For whenever
intimidation and injustice
vie with decency and honor,
let the Doctors arise,
and arise they must.
For within every one of us
there is a Doctor.
A dormant Doctor,
a supreme arbitrator
who can be summoned to
intervene when crises threaten
the stabilities and well-being
of our heartlands.
[All clapping]
Now, let's party.
