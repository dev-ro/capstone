You were accused of ...
"Depraved indifference

There was one in the attic.

You assaulted my fish, so you get
a blow. Where do you want him?
Face or balls.

I just rearranged the aquarium.
Then I hung the painting ...

Face.
Excuse me, can you tell
where the toilet is?
You looks smart
Did you know that this actually by
someone else had invented?
And that are not inventions,

So here was little invented.
Dude, I just want to know

It is left back in the shop
behind the household products.
What are you doing?
I just thought of ways that

That's just rude.
You live with a fish.
You have not invited the fish.

This is unfortunate. For Robert Axle is the only
where they'll deal with ...
if you invite him.
And no one is a check your ...
if they know you're related to that!
- I understand!
Oh, almost forgot, I have clothes.
I have clothes to donate to the women's center.
It is not necessary.
- Remember the ...
single mother you have proposed.
And I know she went to interview.
What do you think about this for her?

Everything is filed for bankruptcy.
Have you spent $ 362 million?
Well, you know ...
There were actions ...

You know what, there are a lot of good things
to be supported.
Like the elephant rescue.

That was gold.
You've sold 500,000.
I myself bought for 498,000.
Are you kidding?

You're right.

I'm a terrible mother rotslechte.
Horrible!
Yes, here it comes out.
This is incredible!
You feel at home like a rock star!
This is a composition

Do not be so hard on yourself.
You were right for each other.
No, not anymore.
Was discharged at Family Mart.
That's impressive, they have
there are really weird people walking around.
And then, I drudge out
Here things in order.
Even the painting hung for Claire.
She hated it, I had not done.
She was not angry, she wanted all hang
Before I came to live.
Well, tell me about you,
beyond that you're an angry lesbian.
More is not there.
- I knew already, some more.
I have fake boobs

They sure look real.
That's because what was wrong, and three

you will fall as people maimed.
My name was the product!
We sold all bird shit in a box,
then we sold 3 million units ...
as long as Robert Axle on it.
- What do you want Axle?
Steve, we live in a world
where parents are so paranoid ...
their children to lose
they even want them on a leash ...
but just to know where they are.
Now imagine ...
leash as "wireless" would be.
The child would not feel like a dog.
The parents know immediately
when their child goes out of range.
They feel the vibration of one of their receiver.
They know where their children.
Wireless leashes for children already exist
Sells not really fat.
And you know why?
- Why?
Because no one ever thought
them for children.
What if we watch the
of a child hiding?
But not any watch.
This is just about the coolest,
smartest, coolest toy
watch as ever invented.
Are you ready?
"WatchDawg".
Plays music, video games,
E-mails can take pictures ...
Everything nowadays is playing music,
video games and can take pictures.
Where have you been lately?
- Steve, you do not understand!
This is about bringing together the
A child needs to be entertained,
with the needs of parents
them safe.
Everything is connected
and the only thing to do ...
side steps and the atoms and molecules
we show how easy it is ...
Wait ... Did you just now about
the "atoms and molecules"?
Do you know how hard it was for us
to distance us from you?
Do you know how hard it is to me
distancing of myself?
Axle, from the bottom of my heart,
would love to help, but I can not.
All Jesus, Steve,
I gave you your first job.
Good luck.
- Here you will regret it.
Here Robert Axle,
Mr. I can. Johnson talk if you please?
 Edward </ i>
Yes, Ed.
 Who told you that is calling? </ i>
Robert Axle.
 Robert Axle?
Of the home shopping program? </ I>

You are the funniest home  definitely </ i>
No, look ...
Yes ... former ...
"Bob Exil".
Robert Axle?
"Exil".
 Someone just showed me this song called and
left a message after, but had no name for. </ i>
Oh, I'm sorry,
my name is ...
"Troy Coangelo".
 Okay, and how you write that? </ i>
T O R Y
 I had already been through. </ i>
C. .. D. .. A. .. N. .. G. .. LO
 Really, no E between the G and L?
And you have a working prototype? </ I>
I would not even call
was not so.
 It is now not so good.
Did anything until Wednesday. </ I>
Then  it on Tuesday.
Can you order before 09:00 in the morning </ i>
I glance to be sure.
Mr. . Coanglo </ i>
Yes, Tuesday should be fine.
 Okay, good.
We see each other Tuesday. </ I>
Okay, thank you.
Excuse me, can you help me?
I am looking
to the room of Sam Bergman.
You're new here.
- Yes, you can still set.
I bring you through it.
- Okay, thank you.
You can not get Sam's room,
since they were deceased.
Excuse?
But I understand why you want
because it has a beautiful view,
close to just about everything, but ...
I think you have misunderstood me.
I'll only visit him.
I will not withdraw.
- But Sam is not yet deceased ...
So you can not get his room.
This room here ...
that's really good for you.
In fact, I wanted him for myself,
because across the hall here,
is mrs. Miller's room.
And Mrs. Miller, a nice tie!
- Great.
Just doing nothing,
'll be back.
Looks not bad.
It draws on nothing.
- Yes, try to jail only once.
Prison is avoidable,
not senility.
What do you now?
Can I not just the best
engineer who is visiting?
I told you that people
who were tired of crunches.
Had listened to me then.
- You did not tell me.
You said to me that we needed further testing.
There was right.
And again I ask,
what do you back?
A prototype.
I am retired.
This is a special watch
designed for children.
Combined with what?
A garden hose?
How about 's baseball glove?
How about ...
Child-leash technology.
There are so many children lost today,
We must do something about it, Sam.
Why would you think I
another wants to cooperate with you?
Because you just as much as I do.
5 backs, 5 days.
Agreed!
- You still have that money?
No, but I can manage.
No money, no prototype.
No kidding, Axle!
CENTRAL CITY BANK
This is a brilliant idea.
I can not believe has not been done.
And it's not a lot of extra demands.
5 whales is nothing when it comes to prototypes.
You have no idea how
I am relieved that you told me this.
May I just interrupt you here?
You know how people always candles
blowing out a birthday cake?
And they expect you
with all the bacteria that eat it.
I suggest you:
the "Nielster".
Though I have bronchitis,
I can still blow out candles.
May I?
That's good, right?
I let my boss' business plan to see.
On his socks this afternoon signed.
Socks?
- Yes, bankers among themselves, twenty-K.
You know what the "K" mean anyway?
I have no business plan.
- Do not have a business plan?
My business is my business plan
1.6 billion of which I have built.
Write them not to.
Do I know anything further
Before I go further with it?
No, that is.
- Good.
My boss hates surprises.
I am also a convicted felon.
You were saying?
- I'm a convicted felon.
I'm sure ...
- We give loans to criminals.
I have a really special feeling about you.
And my boss loves gut feelings.
Thank you.
Thank you very much!
This ...
is a great idea.
Give me a moment, okay?
Well, we have a new customer,
for 5 backs, I have a gut feeling about.
That gentleman over there.
Jer?
Jerry?
Ranger Jerry?
I will ...
My disturbing butterflies.
This is an endangered animal species!
Just stay away!
My mistake.
Sorry to have to interrupt your work,
but I want 5 backs of your loan.
You're my buddy, guy.
On principle alone, it is right.
I and Lo are there
not so good for now.
Not good for sitting?
That's impossible.
How can 362 million in eight years format.
- It's easier than you think, dude.
Charity, trophies on offer
on EBay, travel,
It costs you 68 ridges per day
to maintain your own submarine.
Tell me how much there for her
so-called music career has blown.
Let us say that they
has recorded many videos ...
some of which are on Mount Rushmore.
I have to go to a fundraiser.
Or your wife makes me.
That's another reason why you
have nothing. That philanthropy!
What is it now?
Wait, I recommend it myself.
Indigenous Organization Giraffes Sperm
the pygmies with lung cancer ...
organization without the mosquito nets.
It's Claire's action.
We teach them job skills
and how to make a resume.
The women use really means
we have available to them ...
so they can find work for themselves.
This is a great project.
There you can be proud of.
Thank you.
This is my roommate, Phoebe.
I am a lesbian.
If not that great for you.
Really pretty.
Have you seen
we have the auction?
No, but I would like to see.
Do not put a step further, Axle!
You must leave now!
It's a collection action, Medusa.
I'm here to collect.
Medusa ... sounds like Madonna ...
In some way associated
anyone here with Claire.
Then there is no problem
I am present here.
You owe me one!
- I, you got it twisted through 362 million.
I have my least half my
victims compensated. What's your excuse?
My excuse is that the money was cursed.
I've done about eight years
to losing them.
And now that it's gone,
I am so glad ...
I want my parents,
Howard and Penny Camp.
How nice that you vary your
for they can take to support Claire.
Claire was always there for us
in the first place.
Listen Axle ...
I admit, when I heard ...
my daughter with a
convicted felon would be together,
that I was there, I'm sorry,
not easily felt.
But when we have some by
the old stuff of Donna tampered.
In order to transform her bedroom
into a guest room.
And they found my old light-in-Saurus
And when we heard that you
for when Claire had designed,
we shot almost tears.
- He is really good.
Is not this great,
this meeting.
Great.
Penny Camp ...
What happened to this meeting
that so ...
is great.
People helping people?
You said it. That's it in a sentence.
The community.
Culture and ... community.
Ladies and gentlemen ...
so if we all would agree.
Coming together as a community.
As a culture.
Ask yourself this question.
How many women has this center helped
this year the drug to remain?
Community?
- He thinks it's a rehab center.
Believe me,
When I founded my company ...
I did not nail
to scratching my ass.
See that women in this wall.
Bring things into their bodies ...
that simply harmful.
And this place that fixes.
You should now all you
checkbooks to take ...
and a big check
write for my daughter.
They do not do this.
Here we all participate.
Let this wall a success.
A world of success!
What do you think?
What the hell was that?
- No idea, what do you think?
It's some big event
Tonight everyone was invited ...
apart from me.
- That's why you were not invited.
Your speech!
What was wrong with my speech?
They would have done what I asked.
- This is not rehab!
You know so much from it!
What difference does it? Drugs or
unemployment, it is about helping people.
Forget it. You do
about me not to worry.
I have something new
that to happen.
Upcoming Tuesday ...
- Let me guess.
The great Robert Axle will
back in all its glory.
It's as if you prefer
I have so happy.
Homeless and unemployed.
Would it really so bad
if I went back to the wind?
After what I've been through.
My parents took you great.
And that speech was amazing.
Axle not give up,
you still come out.
I am a unique light-in-Saurus,
signed by Robert Axle.
As seen in the original
home shopping program ...
for $ 2,500 ...
Daddy, it's you did.
You have it sold.
No, honey.
We have done so.
We sold it together.
And you know why?
You have my picture taken?
I did.
What is happening now all ...
Unbelievable!
How much fun you're well.
Find that you get good giggle, eh.
And what I have for you,
do you like better.
You had better taken a raincoat.
Thank you, there
I had never occurred.
How's your daughter.
Well.
- So they can let the past rest?
Most children can have their parents
not forgive them locked up.
Excuse me, who are you?
- Partially probation officer ...
and part therapist.
- Keep it only on probation.
All right.
What is the Family Mart.
Not much to say,
Family Mart is Family Mart.
Troy told me he had to dismiss you.
Much of this probation
work have been fixed Axle.
67% of the criminals
end up back in prison.
Last week you told me
it was only 62%.
Did I say that?
Well there's a new report.
It is increasing.
How wonderful.
What?
What then?
Where's the rock?
That bastard!
What happened?
- My ex ...
That bitch has stolen my stuff!
"It'll really wrong
and girls separate.
"It'll really go wrong now!
Hi, I would like to make a deposit.
- Okay.
You are the center.
I think that's great.
Had just left with my sister,
how they help women with work, etc.
Do you know that this week
some were bad checks?
Have you submitted applications for funding?
- Yes, subsidies are really ...
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.
- Maybe ...
One moment please.
I'll call you back.
- No, no, no ...
Just do nothing stupid.
- I do anything stupid to do.
I call it from here.
Give me back my rock, bitch!
Donna, I have no time.
- Wait, wait ...
What is it, Phoebe?
Bitch, give me back my rock band!
What am therefore going to do?
Will you accompany the miniemen?
Give me back my rock band!
Give me my $ 4,200 back
I've spent on your tits.
Stop cocks over my tits!
They are great, asshole!
- Do you want your game back?
You want your game back?
Your ex is a guy?
I thought you were a lesbian.
I am.
Here is your game!
Take that!
Do not break it!
And the drums?
Some drums require it?
Who the fuck is that?
You're worthless, Phoebe.
A man like me, do you ever again.
Who will you settle for.
You do not even know who you are.
You're nothing without me!
Riding, riding ...
Forget that guy anyway.
That's an idiot.
I had to stop him,
someone had to do it.
He is an idiot
and a liar!
Because everyone can see that
he is in love with you.
He did not think you're beautiful,
handsome, intelligent ...
You're just funny,
You have such great flair about you.
He is an absolute idiot that ...
He probably feels stupid now ...
How's your day been, Claire?
Dreadful.
So I had with everyone.
I hate people.
And do you know what?
Everywhere I go ...
Everyone is talking about
from the center and when it comes ...
nobody wants to do what.
What's wrong with you?
I said nothing.
- I know.
What can I say?
- You're weird.
I'm not weird, I ...
Tonight I have a date
with my boyfriend, Jack.
If someone wants to do?
Where are you going?
- I go to the house of your mother.
Go to the house of my mother?
- Ince they do want to speak with me.
Did I miss it?
- My parents' divorce, but ...
that happens.
- Separation?
But ... Since when?
Since my father my mother
cheating with her friend.
My God!
If you go to my mother's house,
we all go.
Then we all?
- Did you sometimes better to do?
I have a date with a woman.
It's a lesbian!
We go all night
horny lesbian sex.
You rather lick a public toilet or
eat your gum that comes from a subway?
The gum.
How dirty it may be ...
still better than a toilet.
- By the way ...
What were the toilets in the jail?
- Not as good, same as your last album.
In what I do, you'll see all
supersmerige pots at once
So I would that gum
all day chewing.
How can you call this a game?
Monopoly, Scrabble, these are games.
It's disgusting.
This is my girlfriend, Steak.
- Is he.
Steak?
'S Kippenvleugeltje?
No, I'm vegetarian.
Really? Is that okay, considering
Phoebe by 'n piece of meat is.
There are other things
I like to eat meat outside.
I have one.
Would you rather ...
30 years happily married
with the love of your life ...
only to find out
he has deceived all the time.
Or ... 20 years that lazy bag
care of a husband ...
who finally scores, but emotionally
dissociates from you and your daughter.
I'll talk to her.
Weird.
- Thought it was a party here?
How can he do this to me?
Then he wanted to harm anyone,
he just wanted to do something himself.
Plays no role. If you have a family
To build, you go to an engagement.
You go back not
to people who love you.
Fathers are also human.
If you have a piece of cake
to put our noses ...
that's all we see.
Family, children, whatever ...
we forget everything, we
have only tunnel vision.
Have you ever cheated Lorraine?
No, never.
I left her for my work.
I'm so mad at him.
There is much anger in the air.
Do you think that helps?
Congratulations. You've been approved.
Are you my father and friends, or ...
How about that?
No, he has helped me
my guitar for Eddie to get.
My console.
And ... more.
Has he met Eddie?
Yes, it was not in the usual way,
Eddie but he does in his balls crushed.
So, from behind.
I think your dad
really great.
Why is it so great?
He made me realize just
that my father is not perfect.
And that I should accept.
No, Daddy, do not go away.
I'm afraid of the dark.
Okay, sweetie.
I'll stay a while with you.
What is that?
Look at the fumes.
Look.
Animals do.
Does my heart good.
Makes me feel young by.
My mind as sharp as anything.
You know what?
I do not know whether they are
can handle it without me.
Hello, Sam?
- You have my check it, right?
Of course.
Got out of my own pocket
to advance this.
You have no idea how many watches,
MP3 players and video games ...
I have taken each other out
for I have had for each other.
Then I do not have
where it fits.
Rotspul that I took from
medium hard foam cut
I have no more money.
I have not more than 5,000.
Do not worry about it.
You're welcome.
I'm not so useful in years felt.
Here it is.
The speaker sits in the ear.
The camera in the nose.
In order to control the game and
optimal game control.
Sam, this is great!
What is that?
- A built-in compass.
Do children have the compass?
- When I was young.
I thought that with wireless child leash
compass is needed.
'S wireless child leash?
That's a good idea.
The child wanders off,
The parents feel a buzz or something ...
You're kidding, right?
- No, no joke.
That's a great idea.
've Still done well, eh?
Well done anyway?
Sam, you did extremely well done.
If it's a little, Troy?
I have four titanium screws
in my shin.
What do you think?
I'm on a great idea, Troy.
Congratulations.
- Yes.
But this time may
I am not alone.
I need a partner.
I earn 32,070 per year
drive a Toyota-developed fat.
There you have the wrong person here, Axle.
- You just go to a meeting.
When?
- Tomorrow morning.
Morning?
Thank you for the time to let us know.
I was usually alone, but now the
prototype does not work, there's no point.
Why a prototype,
if it does not work.
Nobody will buy something from a guy
people who cut off their fingers.
But Troy Coangelo ...
that is totally different.
I do not even start with.
- Help me with this please?
Tomorrow I am from 07.00 to 19.00
- What is the role it still.
So, the Family Mart a few hours
without a store manager make.
What could go wrong?
- A lot!
Oh, come on. Come on!
- A lot can happen!
Family Mart obsession if you will not let go
nobody will ever take seriously.
Have not enough people
their lives ruined?
Perhaps as narrow as
but can best succeed.
Is that for me?
- Try it.
Let's see.
Your head is not good,
I do just fine.
Is this like those pink coat ...
- I want you looks.
Let me just finish.
Why are you doing?
I was the one who believed in your.
Mom is not!
I was!
And I still believe in you.
I'm not really someone who hugs.
Godsamme, Troy!
I did my knee in
their time had broken.
No ticket, not even
"How's your leg, Troy".
I have been three years an assistant
store manager, and do you know what?
There is no shop manager,
I do everything.
They want me just the title
not give because of the extra pay.
Where is this going, Troy?
- Shame on you!
I ashamed?
- Not you, Family Mart!
Will you help me or not?
- I will help you ...
but not the money, not for
the women, not for the gold.
It's the principle!
How much did you take painkillers?
- Why?
I have maybe taken a few extra.
I get very nervous during meetings,
especially important.
I put my bike back
and then I drive, right?
Can I help you?
We have an appointment with my James.
- Matt James.
Are not you Robert Axle?
This is my partner, Troy Coangelo,
you have the appointment with him regularly.
- Yes, I have "Troy said ...
but not with Robert Axle.
- We are partners. Does it matter?
It matters that I did not know
you went. - I'm sorry.
Is that a problem?
Come on.
Nice to meet you.
- Pleasant, Troy Coangelo.
Why did you receptionist,
who does her job well.
Sheila?
She is great!
You do not want your receptionist there
to look good, it can be annoying.
She is my wife.
Hey, Sheila, do look sweet
and fetch me a soda for me.
I get it shortly.
Is presented:
The WatchDawg!
That's just great!
- It plays MP3s ...
videos, photos, but this is
The most unique thing about this device ...
It's also a wireless child leash.
- Does the prototype?
Shit the dogs filled the street, Sheila?
Sent for testing to
WatchTest@WatchDawg.org
Play the music again.
- That I forgot to recharge.
The e-mail could not be delivered.
We will not lie to you
The prototype still has some work.
I do not tell you that a perfectly
model, but this can be improved.
This is a great idea and ...
- I do not you say, but ...
Honesty is the best. I
Steve Leslie met two days back ...
He came up with something almost identical.
He is the casting and
WatchPal will call.
FastTrack wants to market fast
and that we co-financing.
I saw him a couple days before you meet
put it to him, and he thought it was anything but.
I'm sorry for you.
Do you know why the fourth largest Family Mart
large supermarket chain in the country?
No, no idea.
- Because it is not Target, or K-Mart ...
and above all no Wal-Mart!
It's Family Mart!
That all copies.
That occurs when,
the large wants to hear ...
So if you are in the Family Mart version
WatchDawg wants to invest
but let nothing stop you.
In case anyone wonders who is a
advance of six zeros have been ...
for inventing a brand new
novel compound,
then I should be, Robert Axle.
Yes! The same Robert Axle ...
to eight years imprisonment
has had, but ...
Did I say that advance
six zeros listed?
Any how, I'm back!
Everything looks better than ever.
I will take some of that money
to share with my new partner ...
Donna Someone's stolen identity.
- And for a $ 5,000 credit card scam done.
And let the card go to the mailbox
deliver around the corner.
Look ...
Girls ...
This is not a problem, okay?
I have a check in my pocket
for $ 125,000 ...
So we are going for 5,000. dollars
not get excited, right?
I'm going to pay credit card
before the first practice.
You're a liar, false
and a swindler.
I duimde all that time for you
and you had robbed me?
No, I have not robbed
just borrowed!
Let them do this.
Listen to me, trust me.
I trusted you!
- Look, sweetheart.
Want to see your center funded?
Give me six months ...
we can even ten centers funded!
- There is no we, only yourself!
It was always just for yourself!
I give you five minutes
to be out of here.
Or I'll call the police.
Six months later.
It's just that feeling 
of security that you ...</ i>
if you're wearing a  WatchPal.
I mean, what do children love? </ I>
 a buddy, a friend.
Of this product, they say ...</ i>
 this is my boyfriend,
I have my boyfriend with me. </ I>
So they do not think  ...</ i>
Please tell me we are okay?
- Will be all right.
'll Be okay? Do not know if it
have seen, but at the same price,
there are more games
and just looks cooler out.
Does not matter.
- No? Robots are great kids.
They have no compass.
- Children do not use a compass!
Perhaps that is even needed.
- Hey guys, stop at once.
Listen, I admit it,
He has a great product.
It's futuristic,
has a personality ...
Since I am not reassured by.
- But he has me.
The first invention of Robert Axle
Since 3000 he has maimed people?
No one has more to prove.
It has no one looked.
'S Invention? Thought we
a composition were called.
Get rid of that word. As they shiver.
We just call it an invention.
Let them call it what they want,
because this is the answer.
This is an epic of the inventors
of modern history ...
this thought has
During the last 10 years.
Such a promising idea that security
A child should go forward.
That anyone missing
digits on forgetting.
Write that down.
- What record?
What just said. That is important.
- Is not Sheila's work?
Write it down!
As not to write.
What is that?
My lucky charm?
That must hurt.
Knee to the head is not good.
In life, you help your partner.
Kirsty, so pretty high.
Ann Connor look-what?
You are really doing well!
Well, you are dirty and smelly,
do but you're gone.
Well done.
What do you want?
Want this for me to give Claire?
What is that? - The invitation to
The launch of the WatchDawg.
Why not give it her own?
- Mine would not accept them.
She does not even have the phone,
or does not ring back.
Why would that be?
- I did not steal that money, right?
At most borrowed.
I did everything I could ...
her heart to save.
- You wanted Extractor yourself.
This one does not exclude the other.
- You did not Robin Hood thing,
It was just selfish, and wrong
what her since childhood aandeed.
I am a father and do not apologize because
my daughter wanted to give a great life.
You were also able to post.
What?
That invitation.
He could just as well by post.
Did not have to go through me.
This is not kindergarten.
I wanted you to see.
Because of the tits, right?
- What?
They hang too low?
- What are you talking about?
We have a couple of months ago
kissed and I thought it was really good ...
and do not know what you thought, but ...
you came to my tits and ...
you quit.
Do you not use that word?
Tits?
- Yes.
I think you're wonderful,
but that behavior is not cool.
And I quit because you
The friend of my daughter.
And the tits are good, not too high,
not too low, at just the perfect place.
Can I call you shortly

We have news.
- Great news.

We're moving to Tampa!
- Tampa?
I just want to relax and

Wait, what's this really about?
We have got an offer on the house.
Furniture, cars, just everything.
So the only thing remaining
Blue is your house ...
and with some luck that sold today.
To anyone?
- To you for $ 1.

This is really not necessary.
Honey, it's cute that you
In a coffee shop works ...
but you had a career.
And a good one too!
Someday I'll go back to save the world,
but now ...
I need a break.
- This is not 'a break'.
This is a dead end.
Your mother loves you. They just do not want
that the same mistakes they did.
As Robert Axle let it ruin her life?
Not forgive him.
I better go back to work.
This is for you.
It's your father,
He came by the school.
You still speak with my father?
I kissed him, okay?
- You kissed him?
I'm sorry, feel really bad for.
- You have to feel bad.
That does not help.
- I try not to help.
After everything he did,
They are nice to him?
He just makes me feel better,
and I thought it was ...
and less ugly. Felt good
not to look angry.
I'm sorry.
- Bingo!
I have bingo.
Bingo!
What's even more of one of the most
epic and unpredictable inventors ...
in modern history.
 Today in the room, financiers
and tax technicians ...</ i>
 parents and children excited
to see this latest invention. </ i>
You know it all that it's a boy?
- No, not Matt, congratulations.
Thank you.
I would really like a boy.
You know Matt, I have not said and
It would have to before I go out.
Not many people had
taken with me a second chance.
Means so much to me, thank you.
I will not disappoint.
I have no second chance
to you because I made a 'good' am.
I did it because I thought you love me
of the richest men in the world will make.
Sorry I'm late.
Hi, Sheila.
Traffic was a disaster!
Was stopped by the office
your lucky to get drawing.
Ladies and Gentlemen  ...</ i>
Please Mr. . Axle to welcome Robert. </ I>
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
From the moment our children are there,
Our greatest fear as parents ...
losing our child.
We do everything possible to make them
close to us to keep safe.
But sometimes they elude us anyway.
It can happen in
a mall, airports,
You know ... It is not always
the children who lost.
Sometimes we ourselves,
the adults.
The parent.
 This is true above all for me. </ i>
 You know, I was convicted of
gross negligence because a product. </ i>
You know it all.
But that I really owe,
is gross negligence as a father.
And here I am than you are
Robert Axle to a composition prizes.
What's the last
what I should do.
I mean ...
Do not misunderstand me.
WatchDawg is a good product with a purpose
and many people will enjoy it.
But it is only a Band-Aid.
It does not help me break the
with my daughter to resolve.
Whether the break we
our children have.
I mean, we really
Need another toy?
To keep our kids distracted.
So we should not distract them?
We must learn
with our children to go.
Without this necessary.
Or the thousands of other toys
that we use to distract us ...
to be the best parent
that we can be.
For this ...
for me is not the answer.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday,
How was he?
Well.
But I do not like birthdays.
So I'm learning every day
new things about Claire Elizabeth.
Not really crazy about birthdays.
It's Axle Clair.
Ben bit about that
"Claire Elizabeth 'thing going.
Nice to hear that.
You have to go.
Matt is just crazy there.
Why, who wants to sue me?
- You summon your support mean.
Support me for what?
- Ideas, inventions, counseling, whatever.
Sales have been crazy.
Tell Matt I
appreciate the offer, but ...
I really should look for work.
You really work porridge.
You're a composer.
Well, I do it.
However you say it ...
I just now with my daughter
'm out walking.
So do not you go back and
edit them but, partner ...
and I am or as soon as I can.
- I care.
No, you go achteru ...
Does that guy have a girlfriend?
Really now,
or do you just tease me?
