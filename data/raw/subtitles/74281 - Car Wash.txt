 The J.B. is here

 Too hot for you?
Then you stay cool with

 This is KGYS,
where the music's

 News and weather at 8:00

 'cause you ain't got
the news till you get it
straight from KGYS.
 It's Friday. T.G.I.F.
and there's smog
in the basin,
 traffic on the freeway,
crime on the streets,
music all day long at KGYS.
 It's 7:47 baby,
that's a good time to fly.
 Can you dig it?
 Hey, get right tonight.
Tonight's the night.
 J.B.'s Disco Dance

 Howard's Grand Casino

 Or be square!
 Now, there are only
three pair of tickets left
 and I got 'em right here
in my hot little hand
 and I'm gonna
give 'em away today!
 'Cause they ain't
no good tomorrow,
 so when you
hear this sound...
MAN:  Disco dance!
DISC JOCKEY:
Get on the phone and call
J.B. at 5-5-5 KGYS.
 And if you name the tune,
two of those tickets
can be yours.
 Remember now,

 The eagle flies

Listen to that eagle scream.
 Don't fold it,

 We'll be right back

Hey, peace, Lonnie.

(OVER RADIO)  Good morning.
This is Billy Bass
and this is the news.
 In Washington a new scandal
as Congressional investigators
 probed into the rumors
of male Congressional Aides
 being hired by male
Congressmen in exchange
for sexual favors.
This will never do, honey.
 Here in Los Angeles,
Gay Activist spokesman,
Harry Twig,
 issued
a statement applauding
the alleged violation
 of the ethics
committee rules,
 after an extended filibuster
in a special caucus.
 A Southern Senior
Committee Member
 replied that
he had no objection
to homosexuals
 as long as they
stayed in their place.
(WHOOPING)
Move, will you?
Get outta the way!
(CONTINUOUS HONKING)

I thought that was a dance.
A dance?
Hey, I'm gonna bet
two dollars on the fight.
On the fight?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Up tight! Outta sight!
Stand and deliver, honey.

Thank you.
Keep the change.
You probably noticed
I ain't got nothin'

I ain't got nothin'

I ain't got nothin'

That's what I think
we need is more love
in the world.
I don't know about marriage
and I don't know if
I'd go that far
but, uh, I believe in
the lunch counter thing.
I think, if a guy
wants to be able
to get somethin' to eat,
he oughta be able to
get somethin' to eat,

Come on,

A KGYS public health
service announcement.
Hi, Leon.
 Remember,
cancer cures smoking.
Watch it, Marsha.
My son's here today.
Oh, okay.
I used to drive
a gypsy cab in New York.
Know what
a gypsy cab is?
Gypsy cab will go to Harlem.
Gypsy cab will go to
Puerto Rican neighborhood.
That's what it is.
We used to have a slogan
on the side of the gypsy cab.
Kinda funny
now that I'm workin'
with the Yellow Cabs.
And the slogan used to be,
"We will go anywhere
we are not yellow!"
(CHUCKLES) Get it?
We are not yellow!
That's no kind of
slur on the Chinese
or anything like that.
But I ain't afraid,
uh, because
I trust people.
I trust people because
I like 'em, you know?
Come on, you bastards!
(HONKING)
Come on! I could
tell from a block away
that you was honest.
I could tell
by your eyes.
Well, not the eyes, actually,
from a block away,
but I go by body length.
Just your body length.
You got a real honest body.
You bastard!
WOMAN: (ON RADIO)
Philadelphia Flyers record run
in the women's 100 yard dash
 was point five seconds
better than Wilma Rudolph's
 Olympic record
set a decade ago.
 And in baseball,
another record was set
 when Reggie Jackson hit two
consecutive Grand Slam
home runs in one inning
 to aid in the 16 to one
undeniable slaughter
of his former teammates.
 Now that's what I call
swingin' a big bat!
 The weather for
Los Angeles and vicinity

You should be feelin' great!
Oh, look,

I mean, maybe I should

I mean, suppose

what's your secret, brother?
Your secret, please!
DADDY RICH:
Thank you, brother.
Good to see you!
The secret?
There are no secrets.
Uh-huh.
Believe that.
I believe that.
Except believe in the Lord!
Right!
Whoo!
And believe in yourself!
Yeah, that's right.
I believe it.
And most of all...
Uh-huh.
Believe in that
Federal green.
ALL: (CHEERING) Yeah!
'Cause money walks
and bullshit talks!
How you doin', brother?
Daddy Rich,
I been followin' you
for over five years.
Well, bless you,
brother, bless you.
Would you allow me
the privilege of
shinin' your shoes?
Please.
Well, you know
what they say,
"I take what is
given unto me."
(ALL CHEERING)
Daddy Rich's special polish.
Special polish.
Ooh! That's a real one.
What's it feel like
in there, Lindy?
Like being in church
with Burt Reynolds, honey!
Brother, I'd like you
to drink with me,
'cause my cup runneth over.
All right.
Blessed be the Tithe.
All right!
ALL: Yeah!
From the body
to the heavens!
And a little bit
for the earth!
(ALL CHEERING)
Amen, brothers.
ALL: Amen!
It's good, too.
Don't even look dirty.
You gonna wash this car
because of a little
pigeon shit on the trunk?
No, not the car,
just the spot.
Don't let the water
be hotter than 66.4.
Water?
You better speak to
this gentleman.
(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Daddy Rich, ever since
I've been followin' you,
I got a new house
and a color TV.
All right.
Praise the Lord!
Why don't you
tell everybody how you
got so rich, Daddy Rich?
This is one nigger
you ain't foolin, brother.
I mean, I'm hip to this game,
you runnin' down
these people here!
What can I do
for you, brother?
Oh, the same thing
you doin' for everybody else!
Nothin'!
I guess you don't believe
in my church.
The Church of Divine
Economic Spirituality!
That's right.
I don't believe in it.
Then you don't believe in God?
Not your God.
My God's doin'
all right by me.
He sure is.
He's doin' all right
by me, too.
Why don't you climb
on board, brother?
And believe in me?
And for a small fee,
I'll set you free,
'nearer Thy God to thee.
ALL: Amen!
Praise you, honey,
praise you!
'Cause it's
better to have money
and not to need it,
than to need it
and not to have it!
Yeah! Amen!
And there's a good place
in this world for money!
Yes, siree,
and I know where it is.
It's right here in my pocket.
Right! Okay!
You talkin'
just like a pimp!
(ALL JEERING)
SNAPPER: Answer him!
Answer him, Lord!
I don't get mad
at people like that.
You know why?
Because he's a revolutionary!
Yeah!
That's right, brother!
You must be leadin'
a bunch of fools!
Disrespect one that
he don't even know.
Wilson Sisters some of
the finest women
you ever wanna meet!
He don't know
nothin' about 'em!
Don't talk about 'em!
Yeah.
That's right!
If I wasn't a Christian man,
I'd probably be
kickin' in your ass!
(ALL CHEERING)
Drop on down, brother.
Drop on down, little brother!
I'm gonna drop on down
with a bit of light!
Make him apologize, Sister.
All right, you got it!
I shall not be moved!
Like a tree planted
by the water.
I shall not be moved!

MAN: (ON RADIO)  It's five
minutes before the hour.
 I promised you
more about
the Pop Bottle Bomber.
 KGYS is first
with the flash
 live from Parker
Center's soul sister
reporter LaVonne Styles.
 Come on in!
 Hi,
this is LaVonne Styles...
Oh, no, thank you!
 And I'm here in
Parker Center talking to
Police Chief Dave Evis.
 Chief Evis, have you
been able to identify
the Mad Bomber?
Hi, Sam.
EVIS:  He's a short,
nervous, straggly
haired individual.
How you doin', Marsha?
Okay.
 And from recovered
fragments and eyewitness
descriptions
 his principle weapon
seems to be
a common pop bottle
 that's filled with,
oh, you know,
high explosives
 and capped
with silver foil
containing a fuse device.
 From Parker Center,
this is LaVonne Styles
 for KGYS News.
Hi! Finite, honey.
Oh, thank you.
Lindy, you
lightened your hair.
I love it.
What color is it?
It's supposed to be
mango, honey,
but it's not right yet.
But wait till I get
to the school tonight.
Listen, Lindy,
I finally figured out
how I wanna have my nose done.
I was thinking
of doing Elizabeth Taylor
from here to here
and Olivia Newton-John
on the bottom.
What do you think, huh?
Flawless, honey!
Crimes, who is Earl
to tell me
to clean up that shit?
And then Geronimo run off
and leave me standin' there.
What? Who do they think...
Hey, Tall Chief.
Lend me your ears.
Yeah, uh, run that
by me again?
Lend me your ears.
Uh, lend me your lips.
Aw, come on, man,
I ain't askin' to
sleep with your mama.
Have you ever seen me
give up my ears?
No, man, but...
Well, then,
what possessed you
to even think
to ask to borrow my ears?
This chick wants to take
my picture, man.
Just for a minute.
You gotta do
better than that.
And just for a minute
ain't gonna get it
either, man!
You gotta
tell me somethin'!
Make me understand...
Well, you know,
it ain't every day
you can do somethin'
for a fellow American.
MAN: (ON RADIO)  Hey,

Nothin', man!
Yes, you did!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Looks like a nice lunch

Hey, Geronimo.
Yeah, what do you want?
I was just thinkin'
maybe I oughta call Charlene?
Just to let her know
I'm all right?
Hey, Scruggy, man,
what'd I tell you
this morning?
It ain't cool for
your old lady to know
where you are
every minute
of every day, man.
You know what I mean?
Now tonight when you get home,
she's gonna be waitin' there
at the door
with your pipe
and your slippers
and that little negligee
you told me about.
You know, it ain't good
for her to know that
she can boss you around!
Well, I don't smoke a pipe
and I don't wear no slippers.
It's the decent thing...
Scruggy, I'm

Take it from me, man,
