And when the hero was standing
at window in a towel.
You're staring at him so much.
Ekta...
Again!
No one can come between us.
That's another thing that your father
has sent us this silent movie.
And you family isn't less either
they sent him.
Movie isn't finish yet.
Today I'm not here as in-law I'm
here as a brave police officer.
And investing the night when you
were missing.
Because someone was murdered that
night.
The night when I came here.
Blue cross street where that
murdered happened.
A dead body was found on that
deadly night.
And do you know Mr. Gopal who's
dead body was it?
And it isn't another night.
It's the night before which you...
...threatened Subhod to kill him.
Gopal is innocent.
And you shouldn't suspect him either.
Gopal was with his friend,
Anthony Gosalves.
Where did Anothony come from?
In our house.
TV without a volume.
Never shuts up.
Send Anthony to the police station.
For the statement.
You lie more than your hieght.
But now I have told the truth.
But you lied earlier.
And you've been lying, lying and lying.
He's not with me.
Gopal sent you?
Take his statement.
And liars will be punished.
Boss, I've given the fake statement
but...
Because whenever you get out of
one problem another comes along.
Nothing will happen,
Why are you so scared.
The way I've handled Ekta.
I'll handle Madhav too.
What are you looking at?
She's out of your league.
Who's she looking at?
Cell phones without ring tone
also hit these days.
Go...
Talk to her.
Let's ruin it.
I mean make it.
And he's lucky.
He has no sir name.
Why not?
Let me...
If Lara Dutta is married to
Brayan Lara...
Then what would be her name?
Lara Lara.
You not married, right?
I'm Lucky's...
There he goes...
Can you repeat.
He said that he likes sunsets.
With his wife.
Lucky.
Why are you quiete?
He's actually...
...saying...
...He's a hair stylist that's
why he says everything trimmed.
I was saying that...
Why are you standing there?
Come forward please.
Actually I won't understand unless
I read lips.
I'm deaf.
Who says that love is blind?
Boss, if black returns is made.
They both will be casted.
My girl is waiting for me at the
mall.
I'm coming too.
Everybody agreed.

What's happening?
See how close he's getting?
That's why nowadays they making
malls every where.
Do you know who's he hugging?
Must be his wife.
She's not his wife.
His wife is Julie.
One who came at house the other
day. You weren't home.
These are the same shoe's which
you beat me with.
That Anthony came out be a
very loose character.
He and Gopla are together.
Meaning?
They were both with different girls
that night.
He and Julie.
And Gopal lied to me.
That they were together.
So... how are we going to
confirm that news?
Where's Anothony's house?
Up there.
What kind of women are you?
You got so frustrated that you followed
my husband here.
We're not like your husband.
Your husband is playing.
I'm sure.
That both our husbands are cheating
on us.
I'm just here to find out that...
...what exactly happened that night?
One second.
Let me call him out.
Hey Anthony.
Come out.
Why are you standing there?
Call your sir.
What kind of servent you have?
Not servent.
He's my husband.
You're Anthony?
Are you going to tell anyone now?
That you're Anthony.
Why are you making your servent
your husband?
I swear on Jesus.
He's my husband Anthony Gosalves.
I'm Anthony Gosalves.
Got beat up when I told the truth.
Got beat up here when I lied.
Do whatever you want.
If he's Anthony.
Then...
But Meera likes you only.
And now you also have a repectable
job.
Why are you so shocked?
Groom is leaving.
Few changes but...
Police when instead of Doli.
Groom is leaving instead of bride.
But what did I do?
You didn't do anything.
You're name is Anthony Gonsalves.
Right?
Anthony is here.
Amar and Akbar will be here too.
We'll watch the movie together.
Why are you crying?
First you threatend to kill.
After that...
On the night of murder.
You're missing.
After that you showed wrong Anthony

You had wrong Anthony write a
wrong statement.
And you know what's insteresting?
This case came to the police office
who's your enemy.
You're going up is confimed.
Boss, because of your fun we're
all stuck here.
Truth is...
I saved a girl's life that night.
And on my friend's yatch.
I was with her.
What girl?
Where's the girl?
Can be found if looked for.
Give you 15 minutes.
Go find her.
Am I stupid.
Give you time. Scoundrals.
Open.

Wish we were more.
Would've had more days, right?
I'm here.
If she's not found in 3 days.
That I don't love Esha that much.
How much I...
...hate you.
Wow.
What a dailouge?
3 days.
Madhav has told me everything
on the phone.
But why leave the house because
of this?
I'm not leaving.
You're leaving.
It's not my stuff.
It's your stuff.
Until that girl is found.
You'll sleep outside.
I'm your husband.
Remember.
Girl in 3 days...
or this 3 years of marriage.
Good timing.
See...
In-law lustful and his friend
double lustful.
Need your help.
What's up?
I was here with a girl last friday.
I'm looking for her. Can't find her.
Did she come here?
No.
But you were here friday night.
That's why everything is so messed
up here.
Hey listen to this...
Why are you looking away?
Your sister's husband is playing
with other girls.
And I have to involved for nothing.
What's the matter?
What has he done?
Say it. Say it on the face.
Why do you say it behind his back?
Nothing, boss.
Phone.
Why did the police arrest you?
Did you rape anyone?
Meera look...
I'm not stuck alone in this.
Meaning...
Gang rape!
Gang rape!
What are you saying?
I swear I'm innocent.
It's the first time in my family history
that police...
...came to the house.
Look... you know I never lie.
You know that.
Actually my boss is stuck in
a girls situation.
And I'm stuck because I was
getting him out of it.
Just once I find that whore.
After that every problem will end.
Boss.
You're strange.
Couldn't you ask her for her number,
address or anything that night.
Boss.
That girl will be there too.
But it's written here.
Only women no men.
Then are you going to kick
him out?
Are you going to kick me out
of the house too?
No...
Why would I kick you out?
Gopal Bhaiya should be ashamed.
I'm feeling ashamed that he's my
brother.
Ekta, your phone fell off.
It was Gopal's voice!
Yes.
It was Gopal's voice.
Gopal's voice.
Gopal knows them too.
Brother has lost his shame.
He knows them too.
How you're going to do it here?
Will have to go the the ladies
bathroom.
Mine didn't recognize me.
How will your girl recognize you?
Hey.
Go to his.
You'll get caught if you go in "his".
Go in "her".
Seems like it's going to snow
in the mall.
He's Madhav.
How do you know?
He's done it before.
Only one night is left.
After that we'll have to do this
all in jail.
It's been two day and we haven't
found whore of yours.
If she's not found.
How will this night end?
I'm feeling so bad.
All because of you.
Now I'll have to take the credit for
this.
Did you find that girl of yours?
Shall I go see my girl?
I know she's is your sister.
But who would let go of a chance
like this?
What happened, Gopal?
You look tensed.
Sobhod Mehra's provident fund
file is ready.
Your sign.
Have it put in my cabin.
What do you think?
Who killed him?
He didn't have any enemy.
Except you.
Didn't you?
You're the only one who used to
always fight with him.
I'm justjoking, Gopal.
Send me the file.
Is Laxman here?
Now start typing my promotion letter
with my appointment letter.
What for?
The girl you had fun with
all night long.
She's sitting in front of me.
I'm speaking from her place.
Where did you find that girl?
Enough questions.
Write down the address.
She's not that girl.
What are you talking about?
Look at me.
Remember when we came on
the road.
Some thugs came at me.
And then you...
and after that...
we went on the yatch.
Have you had plastic surgery?
Story is correct.
But cast is wrong.
He still hasn't forgotten her face.
She must be unforgetable.
She's not that girl.
Only you know that.
Madhav doesn't know that.
She's give that statement.
Madhav's problem.
Night on the yatch story.
Boss, if I can become Anthony then...
...why can't munni become that girl?
You just need to give her 3 lacs.
You said 2 lacs earliar.
1 lac for my get up!
I was going for 2 lacs but...
He said that we should tell you
3 lacs.
And distribute 1 in ourselves.
You keep the whole 1 lac.
I don't want to be part of this.
He said that, boss.
Tell me how am I looking?
Bomb.
How are you my baawariya?
I'm going cold without you.
Then hear this warm news.
Money has been arranged.
What are you saying!?
Money has been arranged.
That's what I'm saying.
You'll be free and then...
How relax you guys are.
Resting, eating apples.
Your movie climax has come.
Movie isn't finshed yet.
Does your movie starts
after the climax?
I found the girl.
I'm not saying that...
Munni is saying that.
Did I say anything?
No.
Did I say anything?
No.
You did so many frauds in the
company.
Did I say anything?
No.
After killing Sobhod Mehra...
You want me to become a false
witness.
That I was with you that night.
And I'm leaving this city.
I'm here brother.
But no one would let go of a
chance like that.
I didn't do anything.
I'm sure that Sobhod Mehra's killer
has kidnaped Munni.
To set me up.
Say thank you to that killer
for me.
Indian woman is after all
indian woman.
Fight aside.
Husband first.
She's brought a lawer with her
to bail me out.
Why are you bailing him out?
He's not a crimnal lawyer.
He's a divorce lawyer.
Now you need to dicide.
That you want this mutualy or...
...in court.
Divorce case with crimnal case.
Buy one get one free.
I swear I didn't murder anyone.
You're feeling very Ionely, right?
I'll go and get both of your
friends over here.
I'm talking about you.
C company D company
What company is it?
What racket are you running?
Meera I've never even touched
a tennis racket.
I'm telling the truth.
Say something.
Forget it.
Let me explain.
Need to tell you the truth.
Actualy it's all because of my
boss and his sister's husband.
Police suspects that my boss has
killed some one last friday.
And boss says that he was at
the disco that night.
When he was leaving, some thugs were
after a girl at blue cross street.
And then he saved that girl.
He took care of that scared girl.
After that they both went on the
yatch at Malegaon Beach.
Yes but...
how do you know all this?
Did they make a film about it?
I'm that girl.
Tell me it's a lie.
It's the truth.
You should be happy.
The girl your looking for is
standing in front of you.
You and Gopal.
That night...
On the yatch.
A man and a women spends a night
together at a place...
...that doesn't mean there's something
between them...
You're suspecting me!
I'm going to the police station
to give my statement.
And one more thing...
If you love then learn also to trust.
If you don't trust me that you
dont need to marry me.
I don't want us be like Gopal and
his wife.
I made a mistake, Meera...
I will never suspect you again.
Please put this on.
Who gave you this one?
Let's go to the police station.
Why are you laughing?
Where's is my Munni?
Have you lost your daughter?
Not daughter.
My big Munni.
Vasooli's Munni.
Look! We don't know about Munni,
You gave me your mobile number when
I will find her I'll give you miss call.
Since mu munni came to your netwrok
she is out of reach.
Who is this?
Look! She is not munni, what are you

You can't take law in your hands,
So her name is law,
Now watch Wasuli's law, send my munni

Her name is Munni!
No! That was our setting.
Then whose setting is with Meera,
She is my personal setting,
Send meera, send meera,
Wasuli took the meera,
Now who is Wasuli?
He is munni's boy friend,
If he is a boyfriend of Munni so he
should take munni why meera,
because he needs munni,
It's enough!
Baby! Not now.
Would you put my entire family in
prison,
I want to put them in mental hospital
