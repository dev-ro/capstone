Treasure.
Why is it always so
goddamn hard to find?
This is the story of the
treasure of Foggy Mountain,
the priceless golden
bust of Marie Antoinette.
It was stolen from Versailles
by French naval explorer
Jean Pierre Le Roche.
He fled to America and hid
it deep within the mountain.
In his final days,
he built a map,
a key leading to this
legendary treasure.
It was his dream
that the bravest,
most feared adventurers
in the world
would find it and
solve its puzzle.
That is not what happened.

Where the fuck were you?
You're three hours late!
Dad, you don't understand.
The Subes was busted,
so we had to shred.
You had to shred?
Wait a minute. Why
are your lips red?
Were you eating a snow cone?
That was a really good guess.
The police are here,
and they're saying
that you bought
alcohol for minors.
- Oh, no.
- Oh.
Yeah, that's a crime.
In Europe, the drinking
age is like ten.
They could have been European.
What made you think
they were European?
- They had a certain je ne sais quoi.
- Yeah.
I think one of them was
eating pain au chocolat.
Ben, I'm gonna retire soon.
I'm not always gonna
be here to babysit you.
What? You know what, no.
Can I stop this for a second?
If you ever, ever...
Johnny.
-...talk to my friends like that...
- John!
- Yeah.
Be someplace else right
now, or I'll kill you.
Got it. See you, brother.
Uh, so I don't mean
to be rude, but, like,
lunch is usually
now, so could we...
I'll go. Thank you, sir.
Skates are cool, though, right?
Goddamn it, would
you stand still!
Would it kill you to be just
a little more like Dylan?
I mean, look at that.
God, the guy's a rock star.
A rock star? He's, like, the
most normal guy in the world.
He's the best.
He looks like he's
in the eighth grade.
He's so cool.
Try to pick up on
what Dylan has.
Yeah.
I love you.
Yeah. Love you, too.
Did you just look around
to see if anyone was...
- Did not.
- You did. I just saw...
- You went both shoulders.
- Never did.
- Get to work, okay?
- All right.
- Good talk.
- Cool.
Okay, let's... less touching.
- And take off the skates!
- See you. Sorry.
What a morning, man.
That was amazing.
- I feel like Apollo Ohno.
- What are you talking about?
- We just got chewed out.
- Whatever.
Sometimes it does feel
like we're getting
- a little too old for this.
- That's what I'm saying, man.
We're in our 20s, you guys.
This is our time to have fun,
hang out with our friends.
We're 26, man. We're not 21.
- There's a big difference.
- Oh, my God.
Next thing I know,
you're gonna, like,
go to bed at 10:00 p.m.
and, like, pay your taxes.
- Do you not pay taxes?
- What are you talking about?
You don't have to pay taxes
- under a certain bracket.
- Yeah, you do.
- Yes, you do. -No, you don't.
- We have to pay... You sh...
- We all have to pay.
- You're gonna get audited.
I dare the IRS to come to my house.
-They will.
- They'll audit you.
- They will audit you.
- What are you talking about?
- Kick their ass.
Hey! What are you doing?
Turtles can't eat bread!
- Fuck.
- Scoop the bread out.
You go for the turtles.
I'll get the bread.
- Just take the bread out.
- Help.
We don't need to
take the turtles out.
Yo, Mart.
You Christian now?
Oh, yeah. Well,
my girlfriend is.
We're really in love.
Whenever I'm around
her, I'm like,
"I don't know what I'd
do if you left me."
I'm sorry, the wind
is a little loud.
Can you say that again?
I'm just so scared
she's gonna leave me.
So the sex is good?
It's great. She always
just lets me lie there.
I'm going deep. I'm going deep.
-Go long. Go long.
I'm going deep. Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Geez, really?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, goodness.
It's on me. Just take it.
No, I couldn't.
Hey, John?
Will you help us reach this?
Oh, um, maybe just
ask him to jump.
This is a three-in-one
North American birdcall.
Just give it a
nice blow in the...
in the hole here,
and it's, uh...
- Oh!
- What?
That wasn't right.
I stay still!
Oh, so you're completely still?
I get hard. She slips it in.
End of my job.
Oh, so you're kind of
pumping it from below?
No, I ain't moving
a muscle, sister.
She barely has to touch
me, and I make a huge mess.
Let me try one more time. Yeah, no worries.
-Sure.
- You suck, Ben.
- Wow.
Relax, Mike.
Night, y'all. Good day's work.
- No.
- Let's get it again tomorrow.
Keep working hard. All right.
Are y'all ready?
I brought the Trulys.
I'm sorry, dude.
I got a big meeting with my dad.
But it's Fly Day Friday.
We do this every week.
We get trashed and fly
in the wingsuit machine.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm doing a
big presentation for him
- on why I should run the store.
- Okay. Mart?
I would, but Amy and
I got to get ready
for the big day tomorrow.
- The adult baptism.
- Yes.
Getting wet with the
good Lord's water.
- Okay.
- It's just a little weird
- to get baptized as an adult.
- Thank you.
Unless you're, like, getting
out of jail or getting sober.
All right, well,
more Trulys for me.
Don't drink all of them.
- Okay, I won't. I will.
- Hell yeah.
- Peace, dudes.
- Have a good night.
- See you, man.
- I'll see you at home.
Later.
John was in pain.
And not just because he
was seven Trulys deep,
wing-suiting by himself
on a Friday night.
The real source of John's
pain went all the way back
to the 2007 Pinewood
middle school talent show.
It was fifth grade, before
John even knew Ben and Martin.
I love you, Johnny Flames!
He was nice with the magic
tricks, and he knew it.
His big closer was the
Purple Flame Quick Change.
Ooh!
He just had to
jump through fire...
change behind a mirror and
reappear in a new outfit.
The only problem was...
His penis is out!
Yes.
The whole school
saw John's penis,
and that was the worst thing
- that had ever happened to him.
- Stop!
Until five seconds later.
Now it's on fire!
And that was the worst thing
that had ever happened to him.
{\an8}Until five seconds later.
Mr. Richards is
touching John's penis!
The most beloved
teacher in school
would lose his teaching license.
It was the worst
day of John's life.
Nice going, Johnny Flames.
Until the greatest
thing ever happened.
Hey, man. I thought
your magic was great.
And also, not a
bad-looking penis.
Our moms are taking us to
Foggy Mountain this weekend.
Want to come?

life that repeats ♪

It's a compass!
Their friendship meant
everything to John.
But lately, he had the
feeling that Ben and Martin
were moving on without him.
Martin, I'm so excited.
I think it's gonna be the
perfect baptism outfit.
I love it.
- Really?
- Totally.
I feel like I'm rolling
up to the Met Gala.
Oh, yeah. Beep, beep.
Yeah, and the theme is,
like, the '95 NBA Draft.
Oh. Baby, I feel like this
could be your new look.
- Yeah?
- And then, like,
if you grow your hair
out a little bit.
Looking like Jesus?
That suit's a family heirloom.
Yeah, my grandfather
was buried in that suit.
What?
-Baby, come look at this listing.
I think I found
the house for us.
Oh, wow.
This is great.
Right? Look at that kitchen.
So, should we email the Realtor?
Yeah.
But doesn't it just
kind of look like shit?
What?
You know what, I think
I actually remember
seeing an even better place.
- Oh, okay.
- Um...
Yeah, just...
Uh... oh, this one.
This place is cute, right?
This place is kind of weird.
I mean, like, who
is that woman?
Oh, my God.
Is she, like, a
ghost or something?
I don't know.
I mean, she's eating a
cookie over the garbage.
Why is she in more
than one picture?
Well, let's just try
to look past that.
- Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, oh!
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
Martin, why would
you think this house
is cuter than the other one?
I don't know. I was,
like, freaking out.
Okay, so you're freaking
out about the baptism stuff.
You can be honest with me, okay?
I mean, we don't have
to do any of this.
No. Amy, I'm sitting
here in this suit,
sweating so much in
your hot-ass apartment.
Yeah.
It's exactly where I want to be.
Dad, let's face it.
You'll be dead soon.
I'm 55.
And unless you leave the store
in capable hands,
it'll die with you.
For years, Trout Plus has
been a leader in the outdoors.
But what if we thought bigger?
What if we brought
the outdoors indoors?
Over 50% of the Earth is inside.
Did you know that?
- I...
- Without realizing it,
we've been cutting
our own sales in half.
Let's bust it open,
Dad, nasty-style.
Trout Plus Everything.
Oh, so we could
just sell anything.
- Anything.
- That's great.
- Monocles.
- Absolutely.
- Wizards' hats.
- Why not?
A bidet that shoots
gravy at your ass.
So you don't like the idea?
Surely, this is
not all you have.
Okay, I've been working
on something else.
I'll pitch it to you, but
it's not fully developed.
I'm ready. I can
handle it, I think.
Okay. Hair Salon for Boys.
{\an8}Oh.
This is fantastic.
- You like it?
- Of course.
It's just, like, a social place
for young boys to
come and hang out
like older ladies
do at the salon.
Every boy's dream is
to be an older woman.
Yeah, that's what
I'm saying. Yes!
Whoo!
Never show this idea to anyone!
Ever!
Son, pop a squat.
Dad.
You're the last person on Earth
that I would let run this store.
I don't know why you want this.
You don't like the outdoors.
Remember Boy Scouts?
The only badge you got was
in diversity and inclusion.
It's really important.
Dying of exposure in the woods?
"Don't worry, I've got
my diversity and
inclusion badge."
Well, what if you're dying
from exposure to hatred?
Do you know that
every day of my life,
I've killed a living thing?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
I punched a field
mouse three weeks ago.
I would give a
bobcat the finger,
- if that's something, I mean...
- They don't care.
Dad, I just need a little
more time to prove myself.
More time? You're 26.
Kids today prove themselves
when they're like 12.
Have you seen Stranger Things?
The kids on that show
are insanely talented.
What are you talking about?
I think you're just seeing
the glass as not having
enough water in it,
as opposed to having
more than an adequate
amount of water.
That's not how the saying goes.
Glass half full versus
glass half empty.
Yeah, well, your generation
loves to shorten everything
till it makes no fucking sense.
As your father...
and I say this with
all the warmth I can...
I only care about two
things: money and power.
And you have neither one.
All right, boys,
finally, poker night.
Place your bets.
Can we play something else?
I'm bored.
Hey, John, where are
your roommates at?
I don't know, like,
busy again. It sucks.
I just got to fucking remind
them that we're a dream team.
Ben, John, Mart.
That's, like, what
it's always been.
So, what do you want
from your friends?
I don't know, hang out
forever, travel the world,
go somewhere exotic like London.
You sound kind of sad.
I sound kind of sad? Wow.
Dude!
-Shut up, Jason. I'll email your mom.
Fuck you, fat boy!
You're playing poker
with 11-year-olds.
- Fuck you, Jason!
- Asshole!
You can't just...
Hey, I'll kick your ass.
- Hey! Ow! Oh!
- Do you want a piece of me?
- Wow, okay.
- Hey! Come on!
- How do you like that? No more game.
- Come on!
Dude, what is wrong
with my algorithm?
Welcome to Hot History Part 17:
The Treasure of Foggy Mountain.
Remember this guy,
Deetch Nordwind,
the guy who went missing?
He was looking for treasure:
the bust of Marie Antoinette.
Somebody has the key out there
to finding this treasure,
sitting in someone's room,
and they have no idea
they have the key
to something worth
over $100 million.
If it's you, go!
Find this treasure.
It's over...
♪ Work, work, work ♪
- ♪ Let's work, work, work... ♪
- Whoa.
Whoo! Yay, baby! You got this.
You're doing so good.
Go, Mart.
Thank you guys for
coming, by the way.
I know it means a lot
to him that you're here.
- Amy, of course.
- Aw.
What the fuck is her deal, man?
Shut up. She's
right next to us.
What is her problem?
She's fine, man. She's...
She's honestly really
nice. It's just...
I don't know why Martin is so...
-Afraid?
He's petrified right now.
- Looks like he's being held at gunpoint.
- I know.
And what the fuck is
going on with that suit?
I don't know, man.
It's huge, dude. He looks
like the fucking sun.
He looks like a pimp
in a high school play.
I baptize thee.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,
you are now baptized.
Whoo!
That was so good.

- You get any pigs in a blanket?
- No.
More of a fan of
the blanket myself.
- Are you kidding me, man?
- What?
You just sucked
the bread off that?
I said I'm more of a
fan of the blanket.
I heard what you said, man. It's disgusting.
-The bread.
In the words of John Lennon,
"All you need is love."
Too bad he's in hell
for doing drugs.
Oh, my dad's calling.
- I got to take this.
- No, dude, don't leave me.
- Yeah, I-I'll be right back.
- Ben... Ben, please.
I was a sinner,
but now I'm saved,
and it's all thanks to Amy.
Aw.
I can't... I can't take credit.
Hmm. You know, thank God
Amy finally found a
good man like Martin.
Martin is a-a good boy now,
but you should've seen
him back in the day.
He was so awesome.
What did he do?
Like, work at a soup kitchen?
No, he would get,
like, blackout drunk
and become a character.
It's hard to explain.
I-I can show you a video.
This is Lawrence.
He was so much more
than just a voice
Martin would do
when he was drunk.
He was fearless.
Like when the dean tried
to shut down our party,
Lawrence beat his ass.
And when my professor
tried to fail me,
Lawrence beat his ass.
And when a lunch lady banned
him from the cafeteria,
Lawrence dated her for
three beautiful months,
until her husband found out.
And then he beat his ass.
And when Martin met Amy,
he vowed to never
become Lawrence again.
- So, that's that.
- Oh.
Thank God people change.
You know, life is full
of mountains and valleys.
Valleys. That's not
what I'm saying.
Dad, I'm sorry.
It's so important to have
- that moral compass.
- Compass.
Not to mention the fact
- that he's going to
treasure Treasure.
- All of the friends Friends.
That he makes here.
Mountain, compass,
treasure, friends.
Mountain, compass,
treasure, friends.
Mountain, compass,
treasure, friends.
Mountain, compass,
compass, friends,
friends, treasure,
treasure, friends.
Mountain, compass, compass...
I got to go!
Get your fucking hands off me!
Sorry. Sorry.
Dude, he ruined the
baptism after-party.
He didn't ruin it, man.
- It was still cool.
- No, he's losing it.
He's always alone in the
house doing the saddest shit.
- It's depressing.
- Yeah, I-I'm with you, man.
I'm... I think, though, he's
just going through something,
but in general,
he's totally fine.
Oh, hello.
Oh, man.
-I was just taking an evening bath.
- With your computer?
- Yes.
Doing research.
While I was at the
baptism reception today,
I came upon an
enlightening discovery.
- Why are you talking like that?
- Guys, I think
I know where the treasure
of Foggy Mountain is,
and I think we should go get it.
The treasure of Foggy Mountain?
Like from when we were kids?
It all started when I saw
a TikTok about this guy.
Deetch Nordwind.
Whoa.
You have like 40 tabs open?
What are you doing, man?
Well, that's how much
research I've been doing.
Well, a lot of these are
clips from Jennifer's Body.
- Is that part of the research?
- Um...
You could just rent the movie at that point.
-Yeah.
Enough, please. Can we just
go back to the first one?
This is very important.
The treasure Deetch
was after was hidden
by a French naval explorer
named Jean Pierre Le Roche.
"J.L."
This was Jean Pierre
Le Roche's insignia.
Our compass that we found
as kids is a treasure map.
Here, check this out.
It aligns perfectly.
- Huh.
- And in my research,
I found out that he hid it
in some kind of chamber,
but nobody's been
able to find it.
What's that?
Looks like a chamber.
This is real?
Ben, can you imagine
what your dad would say
if you found the treasure
of Foggy Mountain?
I guarantee you he
will look at you
like he's never
looked at you before.
And, Mart, Amy's 25.
That's like 62 in
Christian years.
- At least.
- If it was up to her,
she would have like
12 kids by now.
You can't afford 12 kids.
No. I'd have to
feed 'em dog food.
- Yeah.
- Or hay.
Or you feed 'em steak and caviar
like babies should be fed.
You could with a hundred mil.
- What?
- A hundred million dollars?
We are sitting here on
this warm summer night
looking at the key to
changing our lives.
What are we waiting for?
Hey! Oh!
Hey! Oh! Hey!
- Oh, shit.
- I hope your friendship falls apart!
- What did he just say?
- We're good. We're good.
Oh, snap. Brought
the Lawrence shades.
Oh, my God! Come on, Mart.
Is L-Man coming out to play?
Hey, can you not, man?
Last time I was
Lawrence was a disaster.
The cops said, if I'm even seen
on a roof again, they
can shoot to kill.
You know what, man,
just forget it.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
John just hoped
this trip could
remind his friends why they
made such a great team.
Whoo!
By the way, I'm John Goodman
from The Big Lebowski
and a ton of other shit.
Anyhoo...
Well, well, well. What
do we have here, Lisa?
I wonder who threw the
illegal gender reveal party
that caused a small forest fire.
- Hmm.
- I don't know, Lisa.
I wonder who could it
possibly have been.
Come on, guys. Fess up.
Which one of you weirdos did it?
Are you kidding me, man?
- Huh?
- You look like you've been
getting your face
ridden by an Avatar.
- Just bustin'.
- Mm-hmm.
Whoa.
Whoa. You guys all in line?
Oh, snap. Why is
this guy all blue?
I'm having a baby boy!
Congrats, buddy.
Hey. Can I get you
something to drink?
Like if I was a
waiter. I'm not.
- But you do work here?
- Yes.
I was wondering if
you, uh, could point us
in kind of like a direction
where we could go see,
like, a cool, like,
site or, like,
- vista or something.
- Oh, my God. Yeah.
But it has to be
along this trail...
Sorry, am I, like,
leaning in on you?
- No, no, no, no. It's okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
Let me just take a look.
- What is that?
- Don't tell anybody.
We are, um, going to hunt for
the treasure of Foggy Mountain.
- Wait, what?
- I swear to God, yeah.
- Shut up.
- I know.
Our friendship was kind of...
- We needed a little juice.
- Yeah.
Maybe you guys
could've just went
to Dave & Buster's or something.
Can I give you some advice,
- man, about fatherhood?
- Please.
Never cheat on your
son with another boy.
- I'm gonna remember that one.
- John, come on, let's go.
All right, I'm coming.
Uh, it was nice meeting you.
Bye.
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.
- Oh, my God, horses.
- A horse.
- Yeah, give us a lasso.
- Hey!
Come on, give us a lasso.
Left, right, left...
I haven't been outside
this long in like 15 years.
Yeah, neither have I.
{\an8}I had one of these as a kid.
{\an8}- Oh, he's on the belly!
- Oh, on the belly!
Ew, dude. What are you eating?
They're smoochies.
Amy makes 'em.
Smoochies?
What's in it?
It's mostly wheat
germ and pitted dates.
That sounds like shit,
and those look like
- little turds.
- Ben.
- Dude, they're the best.
- Come on.
- Stop eating it.
- Mart.
Dude, IMAX on a phone, like,

Wish we had no jobs.
Wish were out there

with a treasure map.
- Treasure map?
- Yeah.
The cute guys that
came in earlier...
the, like, model
and his bodyguards.
I didn't see nobody cute.
I had chemistry
with one of them,
but I don't know,
I wouldn't hook...
I don't want to hook up.
I don't even know the guy.
I'm not... I don't know him!
Cute? The ginger one looked
like a colonial ghost.
The one with glasses, he looked
like Tim Burton drew him.
And then the short one, he
got titties bigger than mine.
We probably wear
the same size bra.
They had a treasure map.
They treasure map with,
like, an "X" on it.
We should follow them.
Okay, people always look for
the treasure of Foggy Mountain,
- but they don't find it.
- Come on, Lisa.
We gonna steal that map.
- Come on, dude.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- What was that?
- What was that?
- It's a birdcall, man.
I'm trying to get good

It sounds like a guy screaming.
It feels like you should
just be able to blow into it.
Like, it doesn't seem
like a complicated...
Stop it, man. -Oh, my God.
What is happening?
-How are you so bad at that, though?
I don't know, man.
It's frustrating to me.
It worked.
- Oh, my God.
- Holy shit.
That is a full-ass hawk.
Oh, my God. Okay.
- Sort of glaring at us.
- Yeah, you see that?
- Maybe we head out.
- Yeah, maybe we...
Yep. Bye, little girlie.
See ya.
Can't believe that
we saw a hawk.
- Yeah. That's cool.
- I know, man.
Yeah.
Is it following us?
Feels like it is.
What's going on here?
Think it's just
walking. It's all good.
I think it looks
like it's hunting us.
Well, why don't we just pick it up a little?
-Yes, sir.
- Oh, my God. Go, go, go!
- Go! Go!
Go! Go to the rock!
Go, go! Fucking traverse it!
- Okay.
- Traverse the rock!
Wait, stop! Stop it! Stop!
Does it not know it can fly?
- What? Ew, dude.
- Oh, yuck.
What a little fucking weirdo.
Why did it walk away
with an attitude?
- Fuck, man. Jesus.
- Mart, that was scary, buddy.
- That was very scary.
- Holy hell.
How unbelievable, dude.
- So beautiful.
- Mm.
Just us, Mother Nature.
- This ain't half bad.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
- Oh, my God. -Oh!
You boys got a camping permit?
- Uh, not...
- Ben said he had one.
I ha... I might have
it on-on my phone.
Chill, boys. We're
messing with you.
Do you guys want a drink,
or should I go fuck myself?
- A drink.
- Yeah, a drink.
- Yeah, let's do a drink.
- Let's do a drink.
Try to flip it.
Uh, okay. Oh.
I'm sad.
- Manchester by the Sea.
- Yeah.
Okay, um, literally
scariest movie of all time.
- The Grinch.
- Are you guys seeing this?
I can't believe we just did that.
-Is that not amazing?
And time. Zero points.
You guys are not
allowed to talk.
- Oh. I always forget that.
- Oh. It's charades.
Okay, well, since we done
and y'all got zero points,
let's talk about something else.
Let's talk about the treasure...
Dinner is served.
Who's hungry, y'all?
Whew-ee, I hope I did it right.
I think I did, probably.
Oh, the head's still
intact, if anyone...
- Oh.
- It's a delicacy.
Dude, don't eat it.
Mmm.
Interesting flavor palette.
It's, like, hard on the outside
but so raw on the inside.
Good, though. I
think that's right.
You were really, really good.
- Hey, Lisa.
- Yeah?
Hey, can I talk to you over
here, just me and you, please?
Oh.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
- Cool.
- Lisa.
You guys see that?
She's flirting with me.
Dude, you guys were vibing.
We're not even here for that.
Like, this isn't a sex trip.
But when's the next time we
are gonna take a sex trip?
- I don't know.
- Did you hear that?
John thinks The
Grinch is scary, too.
It's like, yeah, just
'cause it's a Christmas
doesn't mean he's not a monster.
Yeah. Lisa, Lisa, I
need you to focus, okay?
We are here for one thing
and one thing only,
and that is...
- To hook up.
- To get the treasure map.
- Okay.
- It's to get the treasure map.
Lisa, I need you to focus, okay?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'm...
You know what? No, I'm not
prepared for this, man.
- Come on. Why?
- No, I'm not.
God, I've never trimmed my bush.
It's like, what am I gonna do?
I thought you were gonna
say a whole list of things.
You go in there in
the tent with John,
you get the treasure map...
And if we hook up, it's
like, okay, we hooked up.
I don't care if you're
hooking up, mid-hookup.
- You can be grabbing...
- Grabbing the treasure map.
The treasure map. That's fine.
Lisa, don't let me
down, okay? I need you.
So, what are we, um...
Wh-Why are we in here?
What do you mean?
No, I just...
There's a party
going on out there,
- and now we're in this tent.
- Yeah.
But I-I mean, I'm not mad. I...
Just funny, like, I feel like
I should be, like, nervous,
but, like, I... yeah,
I feel like I like you.
Oh.
Well, I like you.
We're on a date.
Taylor, truth or dare?
Truth.
What is your worst
memory, like, ever?
So, wait, what are
the rules again?
Okay, so the game is you have
to sing as earnest as you can,
and it has to be
an original song.
- You...
- No jokes.
- Okay. Okay, but you go first.
- No funny voice.
- You go first. You go first.
- Okay.

Do you have a good
relationship with your dad?
- No.
- See, I told you,
you look so good with
your hair slicked back.
I don't think that
it looks good.
I don't think I can pull it off.
It looks really good.
You're, like, the hottest guy.
- Are you serious?
- Mm, yeah.
Hotter than Johnny Knoxville?
Yeah. Definitely.
- What about Steve-O?
- Yeah.
And he's, like, my
ultimate celebrity crush.
That feels good.
So you know how older
ladies have this great place
where they can come
and socialize and gab?
And so I got to thinking,
why don't little boys
have a place like that?
Why is it just little
boys? I'm confused.
This would just be
little boys and Ben.
You sound like you got a
little Never Neverland crackin'
- but you get a haircut at the end.
- No, no, no.
Hold it really tight.
Three of hearts.
Oh, my God.
What is the saddest thought
you can think of right now?
My grandma will never make
out with anyone ever again.
That's so sweet that that's
your saddest thought.
- I didn't fart once, okay?
- I can smell it.
You farted your ass all the way
around this goddamn campsite.
He did not fart his ass all the way around.
-I didn't...
I... Sometimes it
smells outside.
Smell like bussy.
It... it doesn't
smell like bussy.
- Okay.
- What's... what's bussy?
I don't want this night to
end, but I'm getting sleepy.
Yeah. Me, too.
This was really, really nice.
Hey, y'all.
Guys, why are we tied up?
I'm coming. I'm coming.
- What happened?
- Those mean ladies tied us up
and stole all our shit.
What?
Get us out of here! It's like
a million fucking degrees!
You guys, I'm
gonna use my mouth.
I'm free!
- Dude, you slept so late.
- It's 2:00!
What the hell happened?
Taylor tied us up, and
Lisa stole the map.
Wait, what? No, she didn't.
Yeah. Kiss the treasure goodbye.
I got love-bombed?
- Wh-What?
- What?
- I'm going to bed.
- Don't go to bed.
I'm sorry you got love-bombed.
I think we shouldn't give up.
Is there anything else that
we have or could use...
So uncomfortable, dude.
I'm trying to sleep
in a bunch of dirt.
Yeah, and you slept like 13 hours, man!
-You guys?
Shut up!
-Do we still have the compass? The...
- Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Maybe we can make another map.
Oh, great. We have
a useless compass.
- What are you talking about?
- It doesn't point north.
It just points to the
middle of the woods.
It always has. That's why
I put a picture on it.
Wait, wait, John.
Ha-Have you looked
at this in a while?
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find"?
"Let me be your guide..."
Yeah, and it's not
pointing north.
"and riches you will find"?
So, where is it pointing, John?
I think that that's
pointing to the treasure.
- That's what we said.
- That's what we were saying.
- We figured that out.
- Oh, my God, dude!
"Let me be your guide..."
"And riches you will find."
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."
Those rangers think
they can mess with me?
- Uh-uh!
- I don't think so, Lisa!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, John, John.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
-It's just hard.
- It's really... it's a lot.
- It was recent,
and I really
genuinely liked her.
- Aw.
- You know what we got to do?
- Get there first. Whoo!
- Yes.
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."
Who stole their treasure map?
We did!
- Yeah, fuck those guys!
- I do feel guilty, though.
- I really connected with John.
- Which one was John?
Oh, the one that looked like
Danny DeVito got a glow-up.
Right. Who gives a fuck?
We're millionaires. We
can get any man we want.
- Hey, Method Man!
- Hi, John!
Grisham, the writer.
Have you read The Firm?
I couldn't put it down.
I don't want to talk
about John Grisham.
So, the treasure's that way.
Well, I mean, how are
we gonna cross this?
I mean, we could try to
find, like, another route.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Guys?
I have a good idea.
Wingsuits.
Dude, what?
We're gonna fly over that?
We do it all the
time in the machine.
- This is not a machine.
- Guys...
I'm doing it.
Come on!
Are you sure you
want to do this?
It feels like it's
getting extremely windy.
I just need you guys
to trust me, okay?
You know what? Go
ahead and film me,
'cause I'm pretty
sure my old man
is gonna want to see
his boy in action.
Okay.
Oh, my God, it is steep.
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ben!
Ben, you're like a kite!
- What?
- You're like my kite, Ben.
I feel like I'm at
the beach right now.
Oh, like a kite!
- John, cut the video.
- Got it.
I sent it to your dad.
I'm sorry.
What? No!
- Shit.
- Are you kidding me?
- Ben!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ben, you're taking
me up with you!
- Oh, no! No, stop!
- The cliff!
- The cliff!
- No, stop, stop!
No!
- Oh, my God, is everyone okay?
- Ow.
- No, dude, that hurt.
- Dudes?
I did seriously bruise my taint.
We almost died.
And there are fucking
ants in this tree.
Well, you miss 100% of the
shots you don't take, man.
Shut up. -Shut up. Shut the fuck up, man.
-No, dude.
Ben, you failed,
okay? You failed.
Come on, Martin.
Dear God, please save me
from this terrible trip
with my two awful friends.
Please lead us to the
treasure, and I promise I'll be
a good Christian like the
Pope or Chance the Rapper.
Wait. Guys, shut up, shut up.
What?
Dude, look.
Is-is that the chamber
thing from the compass?
- Dude, it-it is.
- Oh!
- No way!
- Wow, that's it.
- We fucking found it!
- Oh, my God.
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."
- Dude, I got us here.
- Shut the fuck up.
Holy shit, dude.
Oh, my God.
How do we get in?
- Um...
- Wait, yo, yo, yo.
Do you have the compass?
- Give-give me the compass.
- The compass. Go, go, go.
It smells like bussy in here.
Dude, don't start
saying that now.
This must have been where
Le Roche hid before he died.
Dude, what?
- It must be here.
- Oh, my God.
Guys, look.
That looks like
SpongeBob's door.
- What?
- Like on his pineapple house.
Dude, that's-that's
the treasure door.
That's probably where
the treasure is.
It's, like, a giant
steel... Open it.
Dude, open it.
I think it's locked.
- Is there a key?
- I don't know.
Okay, obviously, it wasn't
just gonna be open, right?
Maybe this is like
an escape room.
Maybe we just have to look
around for a-a key or a clue.
Use your brains. We
can figure this out.
Shit.
Wait.
Look, under the painting.
"A treasure too
great for one man.
"Only a group in harmony can...
find it."
Botched the rhyme there.
You know what that
means, though?
We have to be in harmony.
We have to work together.
Of course.
Dang it.
I can't believe we
came all this way
and we can't open the door.
 ♪ Feeling lost ♪
♪ Feeling tired ♪
♪ And we are sad ♪
Nice.
What was that?
Did the music open the door?
As soon as we hit the
harmony, it just came off.
"Harmony."
"Only a group in
harmony can find it."
They're talking about literal
harmonies. Keep going, John.
- Keep playing.
- Keep going. Keep going.

Oh, my God, it's an animal!
I'm gonna be sick
to my stomach.
What was that?
I think it was, like,
a sick, hairless bear.
- Why didn't it have any hair?
- I don't know.
Maybe it got trapped in there.
I'm done. Forget the money.
- Yeah.
- It's not worth it.
- No, let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I have an idea.
A trail of smoochies...
he'll eat 'em right up.
Oh, dude. Okay.
- Is this a good idea, man?
- Yeah.
No one in the world
likes smoochies.
- I-I'm just saying...
- Okay, everybody, get close.
He might, like, think
it's his own turds.
Does he like the smoochies?
Martin!
It's following the treasure!
Why did you throw it to me?
- Food! Food for you!
- Oh, throw the food!
Follow the food!
Follow the food!
- I shit my pants.
- No.
Yeah, I fucking
dumped in my pants.

And, guys, I think
the rangers were
a little too slow to
get it, don't you think?
- Yeah, man.
- A little too slow.
I don't even care, like,
anymore that, like,
Lisa broke my heart.
- Like...
- Good.
- Uh... yeah.
- Good, good.
Still can't believe
we found it.
Hey, guess it's all
thanks to me and God.
I tip my hat to you,
my strange friend.
I mean, was the
wing-suiting God,
or was that my bravery?
Well, I think kind of
everything is all God.
Well, more of a science
fella myself, but I get
that you're going through
something with your girlfriend.
I'm not going through
anything with my girlfriend.
Guys, we found it together.
I think that that
deserves a toast.
- That's right. -Okay.
- I mean, come on.
- We can all agree to that.
- Cheers to us.
Oh, shit.
Do we have service out here?
Oh, shit.
- Want to FaceTime my dad.
- Oh.
- I got to call Amy.
- I'll be right back. -Oh...
Um...
I'll call someone, t... Um...
Dude, do I have to, like,
re-download the app?
What is going on?
All right, fellas, now
that we're mega-rich,
we got to come up with a
smart, reasonable budget.
What about ten mil for our
own private music festival?
- Yes.
- And who's on the bill?
- Fat Joe.
- Oh!
♪ Lean back. ♪
I think that we should go on
a badass vacation
with each other.
- Love that. Love that.
- Yep.
What are we thinking, Cabo?
- Yeah.
- Cabo. That's cute.
No, two words for
you blokes: London.
- Holy shit!
- Oh! Yes, sir.
The blokes are back
to take London, folks.
Oh, yeah!
-And I'm gonna eat some porridge and mash.
And I'm driving on the right
side of the road, innit?
- Too... too much.
- Sorry.
$2 million just to
slip to a waitress
at a diner, go viral as fuck.
Oh, and I'm gonna need, like,
a big chunk for me and Amy.
- Okay. What?
- We got to give five million
- to the Catholic Church.
- What?
- Five million to the... What?
- What do you...
They need it, man, for
stained glass and lawsuits.
Lawsuits?
Not all the lawsuits
are about something bad.
Sometimes it's
just someone trying
to get money out of the Pope.
I'm not paying for the Catholic
Church's lawsuits, man.
I need that money to
invest in Trout Plus.
- That's just something you want.
- Guys.
I'm talking about
shit that we need.
What are you talking about?
- Listen to yourself.
- Oh, my God.
- G-Guys, guys, guys.
- What?
Fucking... the fucking
treasure is gone, dude.
Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, fuck.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Oh, my God.
- Ben, John, come on.
- Fuck. Come on.
I got it! Lisa!
No! Give me that!
- I got it! John, here!
- Hey!
Back away!
Hey, J. What's up,
you handsome bitch?
- Hmm-mm. No. Uh-uh.
- Okay.
How did y'all get the
treasure before us?
- Give me that shit.
- Or what, park ranger?
Gonna throw us in tree jail?
Oh, I got it, Lisa!
- Come on! Get in the cart!
- Dude! Dude, you okay?
Ah! What the fuck!
Go! Go! Shit!
You two are evil!
- Great. Now he's mad at me.
- No! Back up!
Why did you keep
going for the throat?
It's the quickest way
to disable an attacker.
- Grab the bust!
- Give me the wheel.
- No!
- Get away! Get off!
Where is it? Where is it?
Oh, shit.
Hey. Never got your number.
Why would I give you my number?
You left me tied up in the
woods and stole all my shit.
That was Taylor's idea.
Oh, so you do
whatever you told?
You know what, Lisa?
The other night
meant a lot to me.
- And you fucked me.
- I didn't fuck you.
Maybe I would've if
the tent was bigger.
- What are you talking about?
- I said get a bigger tent!
Lisa! I got the
treasure! I got the...!
Oh, my God.
What the fuck? You
just hit a woman!
I-I apologize for him.
I, for one, would nev...
- Oh, oh! Oh, my God! Hypocrite!
- Okay, so I hit one woman.
That's not, in the grand sch...
Oh, my... Ew!
- We shouldn't be talking.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I-I... I'm sorry.
I know I stole from you, but
I was doing it for my friend.
- I really like you.
- No, you don't.
I knew it was too
good to be true.
I really do.
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.
- You swear?
- Yeah.
- You're not lying to me?
- I'm not lying to you.
- Just to trick me again?
- I'm being more real than ever.
I really like you.
What's your favorite bagel?
Everything bagel with
the stuff shaken off.
Oh, God, I can't fight it.
- You're perfect, girl.
- Oh, you're perfect, too.
Where is it? Where'd it go?
Yo, guys.
- Ben?
- Hey.
Were you about to leave without us?
-Hmm?
- Jesus Christ, man.
- Dude, get-get in.
You were gonna leave without us.
-I got the thing.
- John, let's go!
- John, come on, let's go!
Just one sec.
Lisa, what the
fuck are you doing?
John, we're gonna abandon
you if you don't come, man.
What?
Sorry.
Oh, oh, dude, I dropped her. God, I dropped her.
-John?
- Dudes, I dropped her.
- What the hell, Lisa?
- Are you okay?
- You in? -Yeah.
Maybe he's telling
them to come back?
Sorry!
Man, Lisa, see what the
fuck... you see what you did?
That was insane.
I hope Lisa's not mad
that I stole her cart.
Hey, you guys haven't
talked in like 45 minutes.
What's going on?
- Want to tell him what you did?
- I'm not talking about it, man.
Can we just focus on
getting home, please?
So Ben, John and the third guy
continued their long
journey home on foot,
lost, tired and starving.
Hey, how good does,
uh, taking a bath
and a big plate of pasta
fazool sound right now?
- Will you shut up, man?
- I'm sorry.
Stranded out here,
and I'm starving.
Yeah, so am I, dude.
Of course I want pasta fazool.
- Goddamn it.
- Guys.
My last smoochie.
- Oh, my God.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.
If it is the
smoochie you'd like,
confess one sin.
One time, I jerked off
at my grandma's house.
- Bingo. Was she home?
- Yep. I was very ashamed.
- Thank you.
- What about you, Benjamin?
I would love a little
bit of smoochie.
That's strange.
Because earlier,
I thought you said they
look like little turds.
And now they're your
favorite fucking food?
Let's not.
I want you to
confess that earlier
you were gonna abandon us.
What?
When? What are you talking about?
-No, I...
Earlier, in the cart, you were
gonna drive away without us.
Are you being serious? Huh?
- You did that?
- It actually happened.
I thought about it for a
second, but in my defense,
I was only thinking
about leaving
and having all the
treasure to myself.
Everyone's had that
thought before,
and I almost acted on it.
I've never had that
thought, man. Fuck.
But I didn't. You know why?
Because of the
kindness in my heart
and because you saw me.
I wish we didn't come up
here and find the treasure.
- What?
- Whatever. Just give me some,
and then we'll
forget all of this.
You know what? Now
nobody gets any smoochie,
- you fucking psycho.
- No! -No! Mart!
God, Martin, I'm gonna kill you!
-Guys! Guys!
- Guys! Guys!
- I'm gonna kill you.
Wh-What was that?
What is this place?
Intruders!
- Maybe we should head-head out.
- Yeah, let's...
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
- Sorry.
- A show. Let's stay, then.
Let's stay.
How dare you interrupt
our sacred dance.
How dare you!
Shit.
Miles away from civilization,
no cell phone service,
no way to call for help.
Now, tell me, why
am I joined today
by you three gorgeous girls?
Oh, us?
- No, no.
- No.
Um, we're guys.
- Oh. Sorry.
- We're dudes.
It's all right.
Little hard to
see out of my new,
awesome ceremonial head.
Regardless...
you've stumbled upon our home,
and it begs the question:
Why are we joined today by
five handsome Black men?
- We're, uh...
- We're-we're, uh...
We're not Black.
- What?
- We're just white.
We're not Black.
Oh, oh, sorry. I can't fucking
see or hear in this thing.
Jesus.
So, what's a Chinese
family like...
- Ah, man. -Stop guessing.
- Damn, dude.
I think his head is too fucked up.
-Yeah.
God, it's like the most hot
I've ever felt in my whole life.
Just take the fucking
head off, man?
Walk normal.
Oh, God, it's too hot!
Tricia!
Okay, Tricia, Tricia.
Yeah, Deetch.
-I thought we talked about holes in this.
- Yeah, holes in the face?
- Yeah. What the fuck?
I can't keep doing this.
Deetch Nordwind.
The treasure Deetch was after...
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Thank you. Love you so much.
Whoa.
Hi. Wow, you look so sad.
Disgusting.
Come on.
Let's change that.
- What are we doing here, man?
- I don't know.
- This is a cult, right?
- It's absolutely a cult.
Dude, I was just out there.
I think this is a cult.
That's what I was just saying.
This sucks, dude. I hate
wearing these clothes.
- I kind of like them.
- Really?
'Cause you look like
a bisexual mechanic.
Well, fuck you, man. You
look like a gumdrop farmer.
Who cares how we look?
I haven't had food in 48 hours.
The guy in the head is, like,
the original treasure
hunter, right?
- Yeah.
- I mean, this feels like
the worst place we could be.
I know, I know, but that
was like ten years ago.
Okay? I think we're okay.
And the treasure's
safe. I just hid it.
What do you mean? Where?
- What?
- You hid it?
You hid it? What are
you talking about?
We should have eyes
on Marge at all times.
You know what?
No, I am not even
entertaining you
yelling at me right now.
Martin, you just threw
away your last smoochie.
And, Ben, you almost
left us in the woods
so you could take
Marge for yourself.
I am in charge. I
am de captain now.
Don't quote Captain Phillips.
Don't do Captain Phillips.
Listen to me.
We're gonna go out
there, put a smile on
and eat their food,
'cause we need it.
Okay.
Don't love that.
Thank you so much, everyone,
for occasioning
this dinner tonight
to welcome our
three new friends.
It's been many years
since I sought out
the treasure of Foggy Mountain.
Over the years, I've
been joined by many
wayward travelers, dreamers,
gym teachers who got too
close to their students.
Guilty.
But, uh, in my
defense, she was...
No, no, no.
- We live in harmony...
- What?
Away from the civilized world,
but when we do need to go
on supply runs into town,
we put on our skin masks
to seamlessly blend in.
Jesus Christ.
Holy fucking shit, man.
I feel like that's
way more noticeable.
Yeah, definitely.
- No offense. It's okay.
- I'm sorry. You look good.
Most of us came here to find
the treasure of Foggy Mountain.
Eventually, we all realized
we don't need treasure.
All that matters is you, me,
each and every one of us,
which is why we go by a
simple guiding mantra here.
All lives matter.
I'm sorry, did I... did we say
something to offend you or...
When did you guys
leave society again?
12 years ago. What? Why?
- Ah. -Yeah. Yeah.
- Now it clicks.
Just, like, now
that's very racist.
Racist?
- Well, we're not trying to...
- No, no, I mean, totally...
All lives matter!
I feel like he
knows what it means.
- I feel like he knows.
- He definitely knows.
All lives matter. I
got a tattoo of it.
- Ah, shit, dude.
- Oh, my God, dude. It's big.
Nobody else get that.
Regardless, we all know that
no one will ever
find that treasure.
But even if I did,
I would take that
monument to greed,
and I swear to God I would
destroy it in a big fire
without so much
as batting an eye!
Santé!
- Santé!
- Shit.
I wish I didn't hide
it next to his chair.
- What'd you say?
- I hid it next to his chair.
On his perch?
Why would you hide it there?
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding me?
You're such a
fucking idiot, man.
Deetch, I found some visitors.
You put it under his
fucking chair, man?
What was I supposed to do?
Carry around a
tote bag all night
like I'm at some
fucking farmers market?
The problem was the tote bag?
I'm sorry, okay?
I guess I wasn't thinking and
I just shoved it somewhere.
Well, we got to get
it back, all right?
Taylor's probably out there
looking for it right now.
Did you see my three
skinny white friends
walking around with a bag?
Yeah, man, well, so is Lisa.
No way. Not Lisa, dude.
She's completely
heartbroken right now.
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
Why don't we just go
grab it right now?
It's not like Deetch is sitting
on his throne all night.
There's a million people
out there partying, dude!
I can't believe
you were so stupid!
- You want to get physical?
- Yeah, maybe I do.
- Hey! Okay.
- What are you doing?
You want to fucking
play that game?
Oh, my God! Why
do you have that?
For self-defense. I
carry a lot of cash.
I can't get approved
for a debit card.
Did you say "debit card"?
- Okay.
- What?
You didn't want to
whip that thing out
when we were getting
punched in the throat?
You had that completely
under control.
- We absolutely did not!
- No, we didn't!
Oh, Marge is driving
you guys crazy.
Our relationship
is falling apart.
If you don't start acting
like we normally do...
like regular friends, I
guess... you... I'm gonna...
Don't. Don't do
that. Don't do that.
- I don't want to do it.
- John.
- You don't have to do it.
- Oh, my God!
Ow, that hurt so much more
than I thought it would!
Why did you do it?
No other way I can
prove my point.
Yes, there are plenty of ways.
Oh, my God! -Oh, dude!
Ow, ow, ow!
-I can't look at this. Johnny, buddy...
I'm getting woozy, dude.
- Why are you talking like that?
- I'm getting woozy.
What the hell is going on?
John, can we just talk?
- Yeah.
- I feel like maybe you're...
Oh, my God! Why?
I'm trying to teach you guys a lesson...
-Oh, my God.
About friendship and
the power of friendship.
Oh, fuck me!
- I'm in middle school!
- What? What?
Y'all remember the good
old days of middle school?
- Middle school?
- Are you having a stroke?
We would hang out
like every day, dude.
It was amazing. Except
for those two months
where Ben thought he was
friends with T.J. Scardini.
I was friends with
T.J. Scardini.
Uh, you mean you
guys carpooled?
Oh, fuck you!
I was just as popular as him!
- As T.J. Scardini?
- Yeah!
Dude was getting his dick sucked
before we even knew
it was possible.
Oh, you shut up!
Back up!
- What are you doing?
- Fuck! I like it!
It's starting to feel good!
Man, fuck this!
We got to focus up, all
right? What are we doing?
A-Any second now, they could
find Marge and destroy it.
Maybe they're not wrong for
wanting to do that, okay?
Maybe Deetch is right. Maybe
money isn't everything.
Of course you would
say that, man,
'cause you have
nothing to spend it on.
Yeah, sorry you don't have shit
waiting for you back
home, but we do.
Stop yelling at me
like I'm a fucking kid.
I will go and get it.
It's not like they found it.
We found the treasure.
- Oh, my God! What?
- Oh, my God.
It was really easy to find.
Oh, shit.
-No, no, no. Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it?
-It's getting prepared for burning.
- Shit, shit, no!
- Oh, my God.
Goddamn it.
So it was you who brought it.
You will be rewarded at the
treasure burning ceremony.
Friends, we've been
given a gift...
the symbol of everything
we stand against...
and tonight we destroy the
bust of Marie Antoinette!
Burn!
And it's all thanks to
our new friend, John.
No, no, you don't
have to point me out.
- It's okay.
- Friends,
look upon this ridiculous
object and laugh.
Not literally.
To those as enlightened as
us, how much is it even worth?
A hundred million dollars!
A hundred million dollars.
Right.
I guess I haven't thought
of that in a while.
God, it's a lot of money.
Shit's getting heavy, though.
Wait.
Is burning this insane?
Burn it!
♪ Soulja Boy off in this, oh ♪
♪ Watch me crank
it, watch me roll ♪
♪ Watch me crank

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Johnny Flames.
Great. Your boyfriend just
lost us a million dollars.
He probably feels
bad. He probably feels
- worse than we do.
- Shit, please. Do you realize
I've been doing all this for us?
No. Stay here with your
new musty-ass friends.
I'm gone. I'm going home, and don't you follow me.
-Wait.
Well, fine.
I'm sick of doing whatever
you want to do anyway, so...
maybe I'm just gonna stay
here and think for myself
and join this cult.
Where-where is John?
How'd you do that, man?
How did you get that?
It's just mirrors, man.
It's always mirrors.
Let's go. Go.
Oh, my God.
I always knew you were
an amazing magician, man.
Goddamn.
- What-what are you doing, man?
- What's up?
I'm staying.
What?
I'm staying here, man.
You guys were right.
I don't have fucking anything
waiting for me back home.
Oh, my God.
-Oh, come on, we-we didn't mean that.
No, you did mean it.
Dude, it is a hundred
million dollars.
Okay? You can do
anything you want now.
Maybe we don't
deserve the treasure.
- Oh, my God.
- Why do we deserve it?
We haven't struggled.
What are you talking
about? I've struggled.
When have you struggled?
I have anxiety.
Everybody has anxiety!
Well, I take pills
for it, you asshole!
Everyone... everyone
takes pills for it.
No, they don't, man.
You guys don't get it.
Now that we have that
money, we're over
as soon as we leave
this mountain,
and I don't want
to deal with that.
Y-You just don't want to change.
You just want me to
be fucking Lawrence.
Lawrence was fun as shit.
I don't love our life, okay?
I don't want to wake
up in a shitty house
I share with two other people.
And I want to be
honest, you guys don't
- put on enough deodorant.
- What?
Take that back, man.
You guys have smelled
a little bit bad
- for as long as I've known you.
- Whatever, Mart.
You're obsessed with this
girl that you're lying to.
And you want to have sex
with your own father.
Better than being
friends with you.
I would rather have
sex with my dad
and suck on his nuts
than be friends with you.
- There you go.
- That sounds bad.
I get that that sounds
bad, and I take that back.
- All right.
- Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is just
making all of us unhappy.
Yeah, no. That's
what I'm saying.
You guys realize how rare
it is to find great friends?
Asshole.
So John went back to the cult.
And Lisa, also lost
without her friend,
stayed, too.
Ben and Martin made it home
and began searching for someone
rich and tasteless enough
to buy their treasure.
With John no longer
in their lives,
they became the
versions of themselves
they always wanted to be.
What can I get you?
I'll do the sausage
plate with a black coffee
and a double whiskey, neat.
- All right.
- Thanks, darling.

How have you been?
I've been good as shit, man.
Yeah. Uh, I don't know if
you heard, but next week,
I am officially taking
over Trout Plus.
Hmm.
Noticed your hair is...
Jesus style.
They're extensions.
- Yeah. Amy loves it.
- It's cool, man.
You look like a... a
born-again member of Metallica.
You look like if Reba
was on Undercover Boss.
So I wouldn't be throwing stones
from that glass house of yours.
Look, as you know,
the sale is tonight,
so I just wanted to
get on the same page
about some of the
financials here.
Oh, my God, Ben.
What the...
- Are those the, uh...
- The cult people.
Okay. Oh, someone saw us.
- Oh, my God.
- Somebody saw...
- Oh, oh. He's coming over here.
- Oh.
Head down, head down, head down.
-Is he still coming?
- He's right there.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, he's coming
in. He's coming in.
- Shoot.
- Ooh.
John?
Aah!
- Hey.
- Crazy running into you.
I was just down here
picking up some gasoline.
You know how it is.
You guys look amazing.
Thank you. Yeah.
You, uh... you look...
Yeah, thanks so much.
Just living up with the
cult: dancing, Molly.
It's too much, man.
It's every day.
You do Molly every day?
Yeah. It's unsustainable.
- Are we good?
- Yep, yep.
- Just be cool.
- You're okay, though?
Me? No. Yes.
- How's Lisa been?
- Doesn't talk to me.
I don't remember
if I was mad at her
or she was mad at me, but
I kind of missed my window.
- Have you tried to leave?
- Every time I bring it up,
Deetch, like, mentions
my mom's address.
It's not a threat or anything.
I would just imagine
that he's saying
if I left, he'd kill my mom.
That sounds like a threat.
That's really scary.
Hey, did you guys ever, um...
did you guys ever sell Marge?
It's funny you should ask.
Uh, we're actually selling
it tonight at Trout Plus.
- Tonight?
- Took us a couple weeks,
but we found a
high-profile buyer.
That's fucking awesome.
You got to save me.
What did you say?
It's just, we're all grown-up.
It's so weird.
You got to save me.
- Save you?
- Dude.
They have white
chocolate pancakes here?
Look at those
fucking guys outside.
Oh, my God.
- Everybody, be silent.
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Guys, I hope you're
happy. I really do.
I hope life's everything
you wanted it to be.
Save me if you can.
I'll see you on the flip.
Hey, guys! I'm back.
- Sorry about that.
- Get in the van!
Ow!
Do you think he's okay?
He-he made his choice, okay?
Like, for the first
time in our lives,
we're the perfect
versions of ourselves.
Yeah, you're right.
See you tonight.
Sounds good.
Yes, hold the bike.
Yes. Good. Great.
All right, Ben, we're gonna need
to be a little more sexier.
Yeah, that's the
stuff. Okay, yes.
My son.
Face of Grills
and Guns magazine.
Hey, Dylan, tilt up!
I can see the bags
under his eyes, dumbass!
Come on!
- Sorry.
- God.
What a piece of shit.
Okay, give me sexier.
- Yeah, I want something sexy.
- Yeah.
There it is.
Now let's try one where you feel
extremely guilty
about something.
Yeah, there we go.
Did you guys hear that?
Good. We love it. Okay.
That's fine.
Easy, son. That's
a floor model.
Dad, this isn't me.
I mean, what am I wearing?
I look like the CEO of
LongHorn Steakhouse.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I'll be back for the sale.
Martin.
Hey, Martin.
I was just telling Father
that after the sale tonight
we'll be able to make a large
donation to the diocese.
That money will go a long
way in fighting our lawsuits.
Of course.
Amy, the salad you
made, it's amazing.
Oh, thank you.
I also brought dessert.
My famous smoochies.
I'll be right back.
Oh, damn, here they come.
They're so good.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm allergic to walnuts.
Does Amy not know?
No, she thinks I
love this salad.
Fuck, you got to start
eating these, man.
Go, go, go! Hurry!
You got to go faster
than I'm going,
or else the pile just
stays the same size.
I love Amy, but I am in
a hell of my own making.
- Do you guys hear a motorcycle?
- Oh, my God.
Alert the press. This
church is close to a road.
Don't laugh. You're
not my friend.
Martin!
Let's go save our friend.
- What's going on?
- Baby, I'm sorry.
I'll see you at the sale.
Now, let's get some haircuts.
What...
Oh, by the way, your weird
friend ate all my walnuts.
I tried to stop him.
I don't know what...
Test. Testing.
Why am I the one that
has to fix this head?
Um, just came to get my flower
crown. Have you seen it?
{\an8}You're looking right at it.
{\an8}Oh, didn't know
that one was mine.
Can we just talk to
each other, please?
We could've been talking.
We could've been
hanging out every day.
But whatever.
I'm gonna go see my new friends.
Of course they love you.
You do whatever they say.
'Cause you're a follower.
Well, no one likes you,
because you're a bad friend.
Me being a bad
friend... that's rich.
If I'm such a bad friend...
Why would I set
up a magic trick
to steal the treasure
back from Deetch
and give it to my friends?
And tonight, they're selling it
for $110 million at
Trout Plus on Abercorn.
Not the one that's on Mumford.
- The one that's on Abercorn.
- Okay.
God, it's just nice
to talk, you know?
No skin masks, no disguises.
Tonight, we show the
world exactly who we are.
Deetch, you don't
have to do this.
What would you get
out of destroying it?
It's a hundred million dollars.
I'm not gonna destroy
it, you stupid bitch.
- You are insane.
- Am I?
What would you have
done with the money?
I would've gone to London
with my two best friends.
You don't need a hundred
million dollars to do that.
Your friends just don't
want to go with you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't.
No! There might
be a bug in here!
Gun it, Lisa.
Lisa, don't go down with him.
He's a liar! He
wants to keep it!
I'm sorry, Lisa!
- Here we come, Johnny boy!
- Here we come, man!
Okay. Where's Ben?
Buyer's almost here.
Hey, and why are the hors
d'oeuvres not here yet?
And who the hell are you?
I'm the appraiser.
The buyer sent me
in from Sotheby's.
Yeah, well, your weird
face is ruining the vibe.
I'm trying to set a mood.
This is a big deal.
This guy's an A-lister.
Oh, my God!
That's him! He's here! Mwah!
Everybody, the buyer's here!
Come on! Dylan, vacuum!
Get it out! Get it out now! Go!

- They tied you up?
Dude, yes. Deetch
went crazy, man.
Wait. Where is everyone?
They found out
about the treasure.
- What?
- Deetch found out.
How did he find out?
- It doesn't matter.
- You told him?

We got to go. We got
to go to Trout Plus.
Okay. Lisa, stay here.
Take the back entrance.
Make sure no one leaves.
Oh, Deetch, I thought we...
Oh, oh, my God.
I think you have something
that belongs to me.
We're closed.
Oh, um, we-we're here

Oh, no!
Where are we going, John?
There's no way we're
gonna make it in time.
There's one way.
John, what are we doing here?
Dude, you gonna fly down?
That's Trout Plus.
This is the only way
we'll make it in time.
No, John, we did this once, man.
I don't know if you
remember... I became a kite.
You guys, we got
to get Marge back.
Let's do it for the
people that you guys love.
Mart, I've been a dick
to your girlfriend, man.
If I'm being honest, I don't
know her last name even.
It's Murphy.
- Murphy.
- Murphy.
That's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- And, Benny,
I feel like a big
part of the reason why
you and your dad have
a weird relationship
is 'cause I write Yelp
reviews complaining about you,
hoping Farley sees
them and fires you.
- What?
- Yeah, dude.
- Why?
- Because I wanted him
to get fired so
we could go, like,
bowling more or
some stupid shit.
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.
I don't know, man.
I'm fucked-up.
When I was a kid, you
guys were there for me.
I wasn't Penis Boy to you
guys. I was just John.
And I've been an asshole,
but I can change.
I'll get to know Amy Miller.
I just said Murphy, John.
- Murphy, Murphy.
- Murphy, dude.
- I'd appreciate it if...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I can't hold you
guys back anymore.
I know that now.
All right, boys.
Wish me luck.
Wait!
We're coming with you.
I'd rather die than
live without you, boys.
Now let's go make
a hundred million.

I feel amazing!
No, no, no, no! No!

Dude, what's up with the hawk?

lot of catching up to do,

This guy doesn't matter.
What matters is art.
It is value... real

Deetch doesn't matter?

Yeah!
Dude, it's so beautiful up here.

How do we land?
Huh. Yeah, I don't know.

Poppy, play our war anthem.
War anthem?
So we have to fight
these purple guys,
and if we don't, they'll steal
our treasure and murder us.
Yes.
Ever been in a fight before?
No. I don't think
they have, either.
But they have, like, weapons and shit.
-It's all right.
- Just use your confidence.
- Okay. Yep.
- Have some confidence.

- We got to go.
- Okay. Come on, guys.
Come on, come on.
Deetch! I got it
for you, Deetch!
They're getting away!
Where is my dad?
Mart!
I can't stop them alone,
but I know someone who can.
Mart, here!
Martin?
What are you doing?
Something I should've
done a long time ago.
Dude, it's happening.
Lawrence!
I am Lawrence,
and I'm gonna beat
ya until your guts
fall out of your bussy.
Martin, what did you just say?

No!

- Deetch has the treasure!
- Get him!
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Hey, good. You're... all here.
Um... let's bounce.
All right, what is this?
Tricia? Help.
"Tricia, help."
Oh, my God. -Whoa.
Et tu, Tricia?
You've hurt these people
long enough, Deetch, okay?
Tonight was insane.
People were running around
with spears in their hands.
Wow, that's awesome,
huh? No, it's not.
It's done, Deetch.
They don't need you.
Just give up the treasure.
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Let me just, um...
I think I'll get my...
Fuck you!
I've been living in a
hut for the past 12 years
doing drugs with a bunch
of losers and burnouts!
No, I deserve a Jet Ski!
- Oh, my God.
- I want to go to Berlin
and eat steak at a nightclub.
I am never letting go of this.
I am never letting go!
You sure about that, Deetch?
What the fuck is that?
Sorry.
What are you doing?
Now, loyal hawk,
drop it in my hands!
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on.
No!
No, no, come back! No, no!
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no!
Just let him go.
He's gonna be chasing
that hawk forever.
It's like something
out of Greek mythology.
Yeah, it is.
I'm so sorry, I thought it would
bring it to us for some reason.
- I...
- It's okay.
- That hurts.
- It's okay.
So, in the end,
the boys didn't
get the treasure.
But they did end up with the
most valuable treasure of all:
friendship.
You see, life isn't about money.
At the end of the day,
life is all about...
- Oh, my God, the hawk is back!
- Oh!
Oh, shit! The hawk came back!
It's giving 'em the treasure!
Oh! Oh, my God, they got it!
I love you guys!
- Love you, too!
- I love you, too!
He was fucking
with us. I love it.
He's a cheeky little
bitch, and he knows it.
The treasure of Foggy
Mountain was theirs,
and they celebrated
until the sun came up
with the people they loved.
Oh, God, Ben.
I'm so glad you're safe.
I looked everywhere for you.
Shut up, bitch.
- What?
- I love you,
but I want you to be
a significantly smaller
part of my life.
As for me, I'll be
doing my own thing.
- No, don't say it.
- The Hair Salon for Boys.
So bad.

He's crude. He's
violent. He's Italian.
Martin, we shouldn't hide
who we are for each other.
We should just be honest.
I'm not perfect.
You know, I swear.
- I watch animated porn.
- Oh.
It's porn of popular animated characters.

Like Mr. Incredible
fucking Mrs. Incredible.
Uh-huh.

Right.

Amy, I get it. We got to
