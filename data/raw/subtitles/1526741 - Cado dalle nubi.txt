< Checco , but what do you feel ?
( checco laughs)
Definitely like it.
I mean, I'd be a hypocrite
if I say the other way around.
Though, you see ...
a singer rejoices
when he left a feeling,
the feeling that when he comes out
through the emotions of the songs
comes to the people
and it's them that 's almost like a boomerang
you go back
form of success .
< Checco : Checco ,
this work to those who devote ?
I can not dedicate it to angela .
On the other hand is immensely angela .
So this is out of place.
Angela is the person that I love

which has been always close to you .
In fact , I wanted to take this opportunity
to greet her.

Suppose there giuseppe
who is a carpenter .
One day a guy comes
and says :
"It 's my son died , make a grave
great , do not mind spending . "
Joseph, who is a carpenter ,
is happy 'cause that 's his job,
and begins to make the grave.
The next day he presents
and the guy says :
"No , tow jobs . E ' resurrected. "
" Who was that? " " your son. "

Christ on earth , but work is work.
There is devoid relativism here , huh.

< Frizzy : Ii family
is the epicenter of our experience
and it is precisely through
This small community
that the individual processes itself .
Today we , unlike
a few years ago ,
we analyze families
profoundly different , less numerous ,
where, for example , there is only one child ,
as the holy family of nazareth , no?
< So I ...
In this book I wanted to
highlight these two aspects ,
these two types of families,
'cause once there was a family
where there was only one tv
and many children,
Now instead of families where there is ...
many children ... one child .
