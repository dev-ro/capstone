Yes, Father. I am listening
Do not be too proud...
...but fear the duty
you have been called to fulfill
Because from now on,
your path to salvation...
...will be more arduous
Yes, Father
Learn to be humble
This is the best thing I can wish you
It will be your duty...
...to listen to the words
and warnings of those around you...
...and to follow their advice
Remember, a truly great man...
...is humble...
...and overlooks his pride
Yes, Father
You know I have been waiting
in anguish for this day
But now my fears have gone
Lately I have been feeling serene...
...because I have understood
how I should use my power
And it seems so simple and wonderful
I will be able to gather around me wise
men, great minds and famous artists
And I will humbly ask for their help
I will have great monuments
built for them in my kingdom...
...like all the great kings
did throughout history
- I will become a better person
- With the help of God
In the fear of God
At the service of God
And now, say the Act of Contrition
"O my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee..."
There is something that justifies
how I feel...
...as I begin to conduct with you today...
...this difficult and painful inquiry...
...which aims at establishing
if our King...
...is still, in our opinion...
...fit to rule
our bereaved, ill-fated...
...despised, ridiculed
and tormented Bavaria...
...without betraying
the unwavering trust of his people
What I am referring to...
...is that I am one of the few...
One of the very few ministers who
has been in office without suspension...
...since March 1864
Since the day when, full of illusions
and hopes, we all applauded...
...our prince as he was crowned
and ascended to power
The Secretary of the Treasury
And now the ambassadors
Their Excellencies the Ambassadors
of Prussia and Austria
Excuse me, Your Highness
- His Majesty is almost ready
- Very well
- Only two more minutes
- Thank you
Thank you
Your Majesty,
the King would like to see you
Thank you
Champagne
Go ahead
I would like to remind my illustrious
colleagues of our astonishment when...
...during the first meeting convened
by His Majesty, we were told that...
...the only necessary and urgent
thing that needed to be done...
...was tracing immediately
Maestro Wagner...
...and trying everything in our power
to convince him...
...to move to our country
What is this?
Private reports given to me
by the police agents...
...that I sent to find Wagner, Sire
Why did you involve the police?
I am not a detective, Your Majesty
Mr. Wagner is proving very difficult
to locate
He is not in Munich,
Vienna or Neuchatel...
...even though he was
in all these places...
...until just before
our police agents arrived
As Your Majesty can see
from report number four...
...it seems that Mr. Wagner
is on his way to Stuttgart
But I am waiting for confirmation
From who? From other police agents?
I thought I had made myself very clear.
I do not want to arrest Wagner
In all humility, I want to ask him
to pay me the honor of a visit
I am sure that having a great poet
and composer such as Wagner here...
...could be very useful
and prestigious for us
You should not have sent police agents
to deliver my invitation
Most probably, and quite rightly,
he felt offended
This is why it is hard to find him
If my information is correct,
as I believe...
...Wagner is not trying to avoid our
agents, Your Majesty, but his creditors
Nonsense!
If Wagner is in Stuttgart,
I will go there personally...
...to apologize and invite him here
May I remind Your Majesty...
...that our First Minister recommends
that Your Majesty goes to Bad Ischl?
Apart from the Emperor
of Austria and Empress Elisabeth...
...there will be the Hereditary Prince
of Prussia, the Tsarina...
The First Minister does not realize...
...that our friendship with Wagner
is more important...
...than meeting the monarchs
holidaying in Bad Ischl
I am indeed afraid
he does not realize it, Sire
Explain it to him.
And tell him that I will stay here!
I am not going anywhere
until they find Wagner!
In this case, I will try
to resolve the problem personally
- It is only a matter of money
- Let us not make any more mistakes
I want him to receive a letter and
a gift from me as soon as possible
Maybe I should have been
clearer, Sire
I agree. A gift is essential
Now, as regards His Majesty's trip
to Bad Ischl...
It has been a long time since
we last saw each other, mon cousin
Sometimes I feel very uncertain about
my future as an Empress...
...and so I am working on an alternate
career - a circus horsewoman
You have changed a lot
Ma cousine
Mon cousin... How long has it been
since we last saw each other?
Five years... No, more
Five years and six months
You have an excellent memory
Thank you. See you tomorrow
I am sorry I could not be
at your coronation, but I was...
Where was I? Let me think
Your ambassador said
you were ill in bed
It is not true.
I was going to come
But then the thought of meeting all my
relatives made me change my mind
- The same happened to me today
- Really?
I was about to go for dinner
when I heard you were here
- Who told you?
- My aide-de-camp. He knows everything
He knew you were not going to attend
tonight's official dinner...
...with the excuse of being ill, as usual
He also knew where you were
So... I came here looking for you
I suppose you pretended to be ill as well
You have definitely changed, mon
cousin. You are much more handsome
You have become
the most handsome king in Europe
It is not a great compliment, though
- Are you here to spy me or to see me?
- I do not know
Both
You also gave me an excuse
to avoid the dinner
I am not used to official gatherings yet
but I suppose it is just a matter of habit
- You run away too
- Yes, you are right
Every time I feel like it,
but always before everyone's eyes
It is true
People have been telling me.
You look more and more like me
- Do you not think, mon cousin?
- I do not know
I would like to, though
- Would you?
- Why not?
I would like it too
You can return to the inn,
countess Ferenczy. I have an escort
- Very well, Your Majesty
- Am I right?
- I do not want to go home right away
- As you wish
- I am your hostage
- Of course
Changes can be deceiving
New places, new faces,
new habits to learn
In other words...
...there was enough to make
someone like me feel content
At the beginning,
I did not even miss my family
I had a lot to do,
a husband to love...
...before I realized that he did not know
what to do with my love
He was looking for love elsewhere
I had a mother-in-law to win over...
...before I realized
that she is actually a hateful woman
She even denied me
the right to raise my children
My own children, entrusted with
tutors, generals and priests...
...became strangers to me
Then, all of a sudden, you discover...
...that the house you have been living in
is only a glum and sinister palace
You do not understand how you
could spend 10 years trapped in there
How awful
You feel betrayed, like a butterfly
that flies into a house...
...attracted by the light
and ends up being locked inside
I realized it all of a sudden,
as if I had woken up from a long sleep
My illness was the sorrow
Then one day I left.
Madera...
...Corfu, Greece...
...Italy. Yes, Italy
Since then,
escaping has been my defense weapon
They say I am eccentric,
but they said so even before
When they realized
that I hated Hofburg like a prison...
...that I did not want a husband
who was always far away at war...
Whatever I do or say, I am criticized
So why should I not do what I like?
I have always heard people talking
about you with deep admiration
Yes
Whenever I visit a hospital,
injured soldiers applaud me and cry
During official visits
I am much admired...
...but they want me to be beautiful
just to charm someone
You will have to do the same here
Who are you looking to charm?
The tsar?
I have heard that they want you
to marry his daughter
I have heard it too
But... I do not want to get married yet
- I am 19
- I was 16 when I got married
Now they say I was too young
and that is why I got tired so soon
They say I have many lovers,
even among the grooms!
Do you think it is true?
I think any man
would fall in love with you
You are very kind,
but this is not an answer
Do you think it is true or not?
I have never heard about it
You do not want to answer. Fine
I will ask you something else, then. Is it
true what many people say about you?
What do they say?
- You have never been with a woman
- I am a Catholic
Is that why?
They say you like being on your own...
...that you despise those around you...
...that you go horse riding at night
They call you
"The Moonlight Lover"
I do it too.
But I do not feel like Siegfried
I have never thought I was Siegfried
Until tonight
Do you know the only time Siegfried
is scared?
When he sees a woman
for the first time in his life
- Thank you
- Gentlemen...
- Ma cousine
- She is not all that
Who?
The Tsarina. You must not marry her.
I forbid you
I will obey. Give me orders
and I will always obey you
Careful. I could take you seriously
It is not true.
You are always joking with me
You do not understand
You are very handsome,
but not very bright, my dear Ludwig
That is why I need you
It does not look like it.
I have heard you are leaving tomorrow
I have to
If it stops snowing,
in three days there will be a full moon
I will be alone
We could go horse riding at night.
Would you accompany me?
What is so urgent in Munich?
Who is waiting for you?
I sense that you are hiding something
from me
I will ask our secret service
His Majesty left for Bad Ischl
after the arrival of Wagner in Munich
The prolonged absence of the King...
...made people hope
that the young daughter of the Tsar...
...had helped the King forget...
...his theatre projects
and his beloved Wagner...
...who in the meantime
showed his true colors...
...he was a profiteer
For pity's sake!
This house is not good for me at all
It has to be furnished throughout
The curtains need changing.
I need a new piano
Much of the furniture is yet to arrive
from Vienna to replace what I do not like
Nothing is missing. I think
everything looks even too beautiful
Too beautiful?
What do you mean by that?
Nothing is "too beautiful" in the house
where I have to work
Do they think I am some sort of beggar
who sleeps on dirty rags?
I despise everything that is mediocre
I need the best to be able to work
Even better, I need security
The uncertainty of the future
unnerves me, it makes me ill
It makes me unable to compose
Do I have to fool myself into hoping that
my music will be played after I die?
I want my music to be played now...
...how and when I please
You are right... but at the moment
this is a wonderful time
Yes... a wonderful time
I have this house, my income
and "Tristan" to be staged
Poor Tristan,
he has been waiting for six years
We will soon have the theatre I always
wanted. The King gave me a free hand
I have already written to Semper.
He will soon be here with the plans
He will be very busy.
In the meantime...
...we have to start selecting the singers
for "Tristan". It is not easy
Do you think Mayer will be available?
If he is not, who else...
I hope he will not be available.
I believe we need a different singer
Lately Mayer...
I am sorry, but are you sure
they will not object to me?
There are some good orchestra
directors here in Munich
Someone brought in from elsewhere
may not please everyone
It pleases me, and that is what matters.
As I said, the King gave me a free hand
He hugged me, he almost kneeled
in front of me the first time I met him
I was deeply moved
A great boy.
I cannot wait to introduce you to him
If he ever comes back
He said he was going away for a couple
of days. It has been at least 20
At the palace, they take advantage
of his absence and do not pay me
They are waiting for the King's
authorization. It is ridiculous
The King is an angel. A young God
descended from the Olympus...
...but he is surrounded
by stupid, suspicious, miserable idiots
I will not find a friend in any of them
You have to come
and stay here with me
So, Madame von Bulow,
is everything settled?
Follow me.
I will show you the rest of the house
- You do not mind, do you?
- Not at all
The kids may be a nuisance
Nonsense. The house is big
They will not disturb anyone
There will be another baby soon
"Can you smell
the sweet scent of night?
"It caresses our souls
with so much sweetness
"It comes to us mysteriously through
the air, and I have no more questions...
..."when I let myself be taken by a spell
"The same spell drew me to you,
my dear...
..."the day my eyes met yours
for the first time
"I knew then that I would not have
any more questions unanswered
"My eyes saw you,
my heart...
"My heart understood"
I like poetry, I understand it
I do not miss music
But the beauty of Wagner's poetry
is in the music
And the beauty of his music
is in the poetry
One cannot exist without the other...
...and from this powerful fusion
a new language is born...
...that everyone can understand
anywhere in the world
A language
that can even spread ideas
I cannot explain it, but I know...
...that the best thing
you can do for your people...
...is to enrich their minds
Mon cousin, what do you want to make
of your Bavaria?
A nation of musicians?
Are you making fun of me?
It is a very important matter,
at least for me
To Wagner I owe my strength, my
willingness to do something in life...
...to be useful to somebody
in the world...
...even if he has the modest role
of an intermediary
I owe all of this to him.
As I owe to you...
What do you owe me?
I owe you the happiness
of the past few days
I spent them looking forward
to seeing you again
Pure and utter bliss
Promise me to always help me
and not to abandon me
- Will you promise me?
- Yes
You are like a child, Ludwig.
And a crazy one too
We all are in our family, including me.
I am sure about this
Promise me you will never leave me.
Only this
That I will always be able to see you
if I need to, even if only for a moment
A moment all for myself
Right. But how can this happen?
You are in Munich, I am in Vienna
I will go everywhere you are
You never visit me... but I know you
often go to Possenhoffen, am I right?
From now on, I will...
I know when you have to come here
For Wagner's "Tristan"...
...the opera
that we have decided to stage
He has been waiting for six years
I promised him that he would stage it
You must come and see it.
It is wonderful
You will understand everything
I have been trying to tell you
You will also understand me and what
happened to me in the past few days
Then you will share a moment with me
and you will just tell me...
..."I understand now"
Do you know where I will wait for you?
Remember five years ago,
the Island of Roses?
The flag high on the yard means
"I am waiting for you"
Remember?
Come. You have to promise me
"Tristan"...
...is like an ocean
of harmonious sounds...
...where you can abandon yourself
as if you were in someone's arms
Please stay
- Where have you been?
- When did you all arrive?
Late. Countess Ferenczy said you were
in bed and did not want to be disturbed
She said it was your wish
And you listen to countess Ferenczy?
She is stupid
Yes, I did not feel too well
- So to speak
- Where have you been? Tell me
I could not sleep
so I went out for a ride
- On your own?
- Of course
Well, with the groom. Is that right?
Let's go, help me to undress
You look very well
- You are very pretty
- Really?
And in the next few days here, you will
have to be even prettier than usual
Why?
- Somebody is eagerly waiting for you
- For me?
He delayed his departure for 15 days,
can you imagine?
- Just to see you
- Who are you talking about?
Who is he?
Who would you like him to be?
I do not know
He is handsome, he is a king.
He will be your husband
- Who is he?
- Ludwig
Yes, our cousin
Her Majesty is very sorry,
but she is not feeling well
She has decided not to ride today
Her Majesty has told me
to ask Your Majesty...
...to come for lunch in her apartments
this evening
Say thank you to Her Majesty for me
I will be delighted
to accept her invitation
My horse!
- Ma tante
- Your Majesty
Marie... Karl-Teodor
- Your Majesty
- Sophie
Matilde
Nene
Maximilian
I did not know you were coming here
to Bad Ischl with the whole family
Your Majesty knows how
nostalgic my Elisabeth is
All of a sudden she wants to see
brothers and sisters...
...and we have to run straight away
to keep her company
- You look very well
- Thank you
The air is very pure here at Bad Ischl
I have not heard from your Mother
for a long time. How is she?
Mon cousin!
One of my messengers
had to go to Schlossberg...
...and I knew that in the green houses
had blossomed...
What a wonderful smell!
Sophie, smell these
Oh, yes. Wonderful
- I have not seen you for a while
- It is a pleasure being back
- Are you well?
- Very well, thank you
Such a gathering of important guests...
...had not been seen in Bad Ischl
for many years
Elisabeth told me
that there is the Tsarina...
...and the Hereditary Prince of Prussia
The Emperor will be here
in a couple of days
- N'est-ce pas, Elisabeth?
- Yes
Yes, Franz told me
that he will be here as soon as possible
An authentic family reunion, correct?
Your Majesty did the right thing
by talking to Elisabeth...
...so that the presence of Sophie
here at Bad Ischl...
...will be interpreted as a normal holiday
- Sophie
- Yes
Sophie likes Wagner's music
as much as you, mon cousin
I am sure you will have many things
to talk about together
I am afraid I will have to postpone
the pleasure
I am here only as a send-off
I have to be in Munich tomorrow
morning. I am leaving tonight
And now, ma tante,
if you would excuse me...
Thank you for the happiness
of the past few days
I will be waiting for you,
even if you have not promised me
The staging of Richard Wagner's
"Tristan"...
...in June 1865...
...cost a fortune to the State
To that unwise spending, we should add
the King's personal expenses...
...to receive in an adequate way
Empress Elisabeth...
...who instead decided not to attend
By doing so, she gave everybody to
understand that she did not approve of it
I do not like feeling expected
I do not like letting people down
And I do not like giving hope in vain
I did not hold any hope.
I was sure you would not have come...
...in the same way
you did not come for "Tristan"
It was an utter success
You should have seen it.
People kept applauding
A great success.
Right from the start
And when Wagner appeared on stage
and said...
I would love to be able to repeat
his same words
He said that,
like Tristan and Isolde drink...
How much did it cost in total?
- What?
- How much did this show cost?
Wagner, his orchestra conductor,
his family...
...Wagner's house, the one
for the conductor and his family...
What sort of questions are these?
It is not relevant. It was a success
A success!
Successes are easily forgotten
It is the best way to stir up
the most acrimonious criticism
Here, the critics started
even before the successes
You... You are worrying...
...about people's malevolent critics?
Yes. If they are right
What are your aspirations?
To be remembered
thanks to Richard Wagner?
Like my mother-in-law
and her silly painters
If your Richard Wagner is so great,
surely he does not need your help
Your pathetic friendship with him
only gives you the illusion...
...that you have created
something important
In the same way as you need me
to give you the illusion of love
You are not able to be alone
You would like me to be
your impossible love...
...in order to justify your conscience
You need the kind of help
that I cannot give you
Get married. Marry Sophie
But I have never loved
any other woman... apart from you
Love also means duty. And your duty
is to create your own reality
Forget the dreams of glory
Monarchs like us do not make history
We are just a facade.
We are easily forgotten
Unless they give us a bit of fame
by killing us
This is the sort of music
that Germans like, not mine
It has got to the point that every single
day the Munich papers attack me
Stop reading them. I will give orders
to have them hidden from you
You should give orders to not let me
go out. People in the street insult me
I would want to keep you
like a prisoner
Knowing that you work
for yourself and for me
Sometimes I wonder how long
I will have the strength to do it
I need to trust you, at least
Maybe it is the fear of life
that sometimes assails me
Life as it was before I met you,
Your Majesty
So, as Your Majesty can see...
...stages have been abolished.
The place resembles an amphitheatre
The audience is therefore an ideal
community without class distinctions
The orchestra, compared to the stage,
is much lower...
...but this is clearer in another table
The lighting system is completely new
The spectator must concentrate
on the scene
Therefore we need total darkness
- How many seats?
- 1,500... Maybe 1, 700
Semper will give you the details
I think we should offer
at least 2,000 seats
Regarding the costs, I have a feeling
they will request a much smaller theatre
- Otherwise they will cancel the project
- Why do you think so?
I am sure this is how it will end up
Just think of the stir
caused by "Tristan"
So you can imagine the reaction
to the construction of a new theatre
Everybody will feel robbed.
They will ask for my arrest
How can I work for a similar audience?
Great minds have always recognized
the importance of music in a country
But here, all they can talk about
is waste of money
They count the pennies. This much for
the tenor, the soprano, the orchestra...
There are other reasons for it
Nonsense! I beg your pardon
The success of "Tristan"
had filled me with joy and hope
Now these stupid attacks are ruining
everything, and involve Your Majesty too
You are uncertain, sad,
with no enthusiasm
Me? No, it is not because of this.
How could you think so?
Without you, today I would be in despair
You are my hope, my consolation
In the building of this new theatre...
...I am putting all the enthusiasm
I am capable of. All my love
Sorry for disturbing you,
but it was getting dark...
...and our Fanny did not dare coming in
to put on the light. She asked my help
Not at all. You have to forgive us
- Can I have the honor of serving tea?
- Yes, thank you
How are you feeling today, Maestro?
Were you able to have a rest?
- Milk, Your Majesty?
- Yes, thank you
- Were you indisposed?
- It was nothing serious
Why have I not been informed?
Thank you.
We could have postponed until tomorrow
- I am fine
- It is not true
Anybody on edge like me
would have ups and downs
I have been suffering from headaches
for years
I am sorry, but it was not
just the headaches
His Majesty cannot ignore
your health conditions
I need to know what this is about, please
- There is nothing to know
- No
Well, I can speak as a person...
...who has been in contact
with the Maestro for a short time, but...
...my impressions are the same
as my husband's
He is a great friend and assistant
of the Maestro
Yes, the Maestro has always
suffered of nervous depression...
...but in the past few days
he has worsened
Apart from headaches,
he is suffering from insomnia
We are worried. But I doubt
medicines will help in this case
The source of so much anxiety
should be eliminated
I told the Maestro it is not worth
getting upset over certain articles
Forgive me, Sire, but it is not those
critics that worry the Maestro
And not even the worries
about the theatre project
He is worried about the future
The fact of not being able to settle
certain distressful matters...
...that have been going on for years
He ran into debt in the past and...
Forgive me, dear Maestro
His Majesty asked for my opinion
and I have to be honest
But that belongs to the past.
I am here now
Of course, Your Majesty!
But I must admit that the Maestro is right
When you are just a guest,
you cannot feel that secure
The Maestro is not a guest. He earns
wages like all the other assistants
He is the most precious of my assistants
Of course.
Why are we even talking about this?
Because you often talk about it,
and constantly think about it
- Why not talk honestly to His Majesty?
- Madame von Bulov!
One of these days I will have
to talk privately to Madame von Bulov
She will become my ally. She will
tell me how to make our friend serene
No, please. I know my way
Let me have the pleasure
to feel at home
I will accompany His Majesty
I can tell you now
what the Maestro needs
The request he is planning
to put in writing for Your Majesty...
...this is what my husband told me...
...regards a certain sum he would need...
...to be able to extinguish his old debts
and look to the future with more serenity
Otherwise, he would rather leave Munich
He would need 200,000 gulden
Did you say 200,000?
200,000 gulden
Part of the sum could be paid
in cash and the rest in shares...
...with monthly repayments
I will have to ask for a loan
from the State Treasury
I will also need the approval
of Pfistermeister and von Worden
I will let the Maestro know
They promise the moon, they swear
friendship and love, and then...
Are these the great patrons of our days?
This is just a brainless youth
The last eccentric
of a family of eccentrics
He will give you everything you want,
I am sure
My love... Cosima
My love
What kind of country is this?
A nation of policemen?
Pfistermeister uses the police
to invite my guests
They are then followed and spied on
by the police
And the letters that my guests write and
receive, are brought to me as trophies
This is outrageous!
These are just standard precautions,
Sire
Fully justified in this case,
as Wagner is a foreigner...
...and he is on the records
as a revolutionary
If Richard Wagner was not an artist...
...he would be a saint
His genius has a moral and purifying
quality. His art redeems us
He is an antidote to the evil
and corruption of our society!
Richard Wagner is a man
who will be remembered eternally
Because art is the absolute truth
What an artist leaves behind
are not his weaknesses...
...for as shocking as they can be,
but his work
Your Majesty is right, of course...
...but if I may say so...
...it can be dangerous to allow the
guardians of the law to make exceptions
Their point of view is different from ours
For them, Richard Wagner...
...does nothing but waste
the taxpayers' money
Madame von Bulow is not his muse,
but an adulteress
And her husband is a despicable
opportunist who pretends not to know...
...the relationship
between his own wife and Wagner...
...because he does not want to lose
his job
These are just slanders!
No, Sire. It is the truth
As these letters clearly show
Your Majesty has to understand
something
Maybe Wagner's detractors are
insensitive to art...
...but they are not liars
Maestro Wagner and Mr. and Mrs.
von Bulow are in the waiting-room
They wish to see you
about a very urgent matter
Let them in
His Majesty the King is waiting for you
Thank you
Your Majesty told me to ignore
what the papers were writing about me
Criticism, verbal attacks, insinuations...
...insults of the press in general.
I followed Your Majesty's advice
I have suffered everything in silence
And I would keep quiet,
if I was the only one involved
But it is not just about me anymore
Your Majesty, in the "Fushbutter"
there was an article claiming...
...that my wife is Richard Wagner's
mistress
I have challenged the editor to a duel
This is very serious, Your Majesty
Yes, you are right. It is very serious
Because we are all accomplices
Mr. von Bulow, who knows that his wife
is Wagner's mistress...
...but feigns ignorance
Otherwise he would have
to throw her out...
...and give up his prestigious post
as the Maestro's conductor
And me, I know everything...
...because my friend Wagner
does not hide anything from me
Me - his friend, his patron...
...especially in such a delicate situation,
which affects his private...
...and public life...
Me - friend, admirer and confidant...
...obviously I am the accomplice
of my favorite
It is only an evil slander.
Unacceptable, Your Majesty
Only Your Majesty can help us
resolve it
If only Your Majesty could write a letter
to Mr. von Bulow...
...a simple letter expressing your
admiration and friendship...
...once the letter is published
in the papers...
Lohengrin is ready to defend Elsa...
...but it is easier to fight in a duel
than to write a letter
If I may, Your Majesty,
I have written a draft
"Dear Mr. von Bulow...
..."having had the chance
to fully appreciate...
..."the noble and generous qualities
of your esteemed spouse..."
Fine
I understand
I will copy it
and it will be delivered tomorrow
Your Majesty does not wish
to read the rest?
No, it is not necessary
I am sure it is absolutely fine
Your Majesty, I am very grateful
I have only done my duty
Wagner knows how much I value
true friendship
His Majesty the King
has entrusted me with the task...
...of ordering you to leave Munich
as soon as possible
Here is His Majesty's message
"Dear friend...
..."as painful as this is...
..."I find myself forced to ask you
to follow Minister Lutz's orders
"My love for you will be forever unaltered
"And I beg you to remain friends with me
"I did not have any other options
"Until death, yours faithfully, Ludwig"
Do not say anything
I can confirm that His Majesty,
the King of Bavaria...
...has been suffering from a form
of mental instability...
...since the year 1866...
...on the eve of our unfortunate
participation to the war of that year
The position taken by our monarch
against the government...
...which supported our alliance
with Austria...
...provoked a dangerous feeling
of general discontent
Gentlemen, you have to wait a bit longer
Your Majesty is required at the castle
Come in
Your Majesty,
His Majesty Prince Otto
- Did they get offended?
- I doubt it. They are waiting for me
They think you are not here
Let them wait
- Come
- We are going back to Munich tonight
And tomorrow...
I have to go back to the front
Do you find it hard?
Yes, I do. I hate the smell, the dirt...
...the cries of soldiers when they are
operated on without chloroform...
...because they have run out of supplies
- What do they want from me this time?
- They want you back in Munich
You are the King
We are losing the war
Look!
The four quarters of the moon...
...like when we used to go fishing
at night-time as children
Yes. And you would get upset
if I had more luck than you
Because I was the King
I did not want this war
I want everybody to know!
Yes
What is the matter?
I do not know. My eyes are stinging
Maybe it is because
I am not able to sleep anymore
And when I do sleep, I dream
of not being able to sleep
I dream of not being able to close
my eyes, and so I stay like this, always
Whether I am awake or asleep, I keep
my eyes open. That is why they sting
You are not well
Stay here in Berg with me
I cannot and you know that
I must go back to the front
It would be dishonorable
towards our allies too
They are our cousins, after all
Our enemies in Prussia
are our cousins too!
We keep everything in the family -
wars, weddings, babies...
We are incestuous and fratricidal
Without knowing why
You are the King. If you did not want
the war, you should have prevented it
That is what I did. And I do my best
to make my opinions clear
As far as I am concerned,
this war does not exist
Tell the generals that the King
does not know that there is a war
- Who is there? Who are you?
- It is me, Your Majesty, Volk!
Why are you not at the castle?
Who gave you permission to go out?
I thought Your Majesty
did not need me anymore
A waiter must not leave the apartment
while on duty
Did you not know that?
Yes, Your Majesty
Nevertheless, you came here
You left your job to have a swim!
I could not sleep
Are you not afraid of being caught
by patrolling squads?
Usually, I hear them coming
and I hide in the canes
- Can you swim?
- A little, Your Majesty
I never go where I cannot touch
the bottom, especially when I am alone
- Are you cold?
- Yes, a bit
Take this
Help me
Help me, I beg you
Help me
It is extremely important and urgent!
Captain Durckheim asks
to be seen by Your Majesty
Come in!
We have been defeated, Your Majesty
We have surrendered
- Are there many casualties?
- No
Your Majesty,
the enemies' forces were stronger
Our troops were demoralized
We do not have too many casualties...
...but to keep fighting would have led
to a pointless massacre
I am happy it is over,
and it did not last long
Seven weeks, Your Majesty
But they seemed like an eternity
for those who were fighting
Any news about my brother Otto?
He went back to Munich.
He was very demoralized
You are very fond of my brother,
am I right Durckheim?
Yes, Your Majesty. I am very fond of him
One day, Otto will be your king
Very soon
Because I...
His Majesty Prince Otto
is deeply unhappy
He is so young...
...but it is as if he has got to the end
of his life without having lived it
His ambitions are dipped
in bitterness
They have turned into sorrow and fear.
He is extremely lonely
He does not sleep
for more than two hours a night
He is unable to rest. He was
desperately looking for happiness...
...in something unreachable...
...and security...
...in what falls outside the rules
What's wrong with that?
The world around us
is unbearable and miserable
Men are only after material security,
nothing else
They are ready to lose their lives
in order to achieve that
I want to be free! Free to look
for happiness in the unreachable
But unlike my brother,
I try to act upon my thoughts
That is why I abandoned this silly war
that I was not able to prevent
I am not a coward! I hate lies
- I want to live in truth, always
- Forgive me, Sire
Allow a common man
to express his opinion
Your Majesty said
that he wants to live in truth
But I think what you meant
is that you want to live as a free man...
...following your instincts
and your tastes...
...without hypocrisy or lies.
Am I right?
In my opinion, the truth...
...doesn't have anything to do
with this search for the unreachable
When freedom is a privilege of the few...
...it does not have anything to do
with real freedom...
...the same freedom that belongs
to every man...
...and that each of us
has the right to hold on to
We live in a world
where there are no innocents...
...where nobody has the right
to judge anybody
I am speaking as a friend.
The generosity...
...that Your Majesty showed me
when we were both younger...
...gives me the courage
to speak my mind...
...as men do with each other
I am a soldier who was left alone
on the battlefield...
...at a time of danger and bitterness
But I do not feel neither contempt nor
rancor for the king who abandoned me
Instead, I feel great pity
My king thinks he has made
a brave decision...
...but he is mistaken if he thinks
he can find happiness...
...outside the rules and the duties of men
Those who love life cannot afford
to search for the unreachable...
...but have to be extremely careful
This is true even for a monarch
Even for a monarch, because
the great power that a monarch has...
...is limited by the boundaries
of the society of which he is part
Who could ever be able to follow him
outside those boundaries?
Certainly not the weak and humble
whose only worry is to find security...
...both material and moral
The same security Your Majesty
was talking about with such contempt
The only ones following him
will be those...
...who see freedom
as a search for pleasure...
...beyond any moral boundary.
No...
...you surely do not want this
Being followed only
by despicable servants...
...exploiters, traders of illusions...
No, I do not believe it. Your Majesty
cannot like such a breed...
...who would take advantage of his
generosity and would try to deceive him
Why would a young person,
who has a whole life ahead of him...
...not be tempted to find
a different reason to live?
Even if it is difficult because it is
the one of common people...
...who accept mediocrity
It takes a lot of courage
to accept mediocrity...
...for somebody who is pursuing sublime
ideals beyond this world. I know it
But it is the only way to be saved
from a terrible loneliness
- I need to talk to my mother
- Her Majesty is resting
Wake her up! What are you waiting for?
- Yes
- Hurry!
Her Majesty the Queen
is waiting for Your Majesty
I apologize for waking you up
at this time...
...but I needed to tell you something
immediately
I have decided to get married
I knew this would be good news for you
Are you not going to ask me
who the chosen one is?
I was waiting for Your Majesty to tell me
I fully trust Your Majesty's judgment
I want you to go immediately...
...to Possenhofen...
...to ask Duchess Ludovica
for the hand of Princess Sophie
I am sure Sophie will be
the perfect spouse for you
I have already asked Father Hoffman
to come here. See him straight away
I would like you to inform him
of my decision...
...and to go with him to Possenhofen,
because Sophie is Catholic
Ludwig
- Your Majesty
- My dressing-gown, hurry!
Hurry!
As soon as Father Hoffman arrives,
take him to my dressing room
Yes, Your Majesty
Reverend Father Hoffman
is already here
Your Majesty
- What happened?
- Did you see my son?
Yes, just now as he was leaving
- He did not say a word. He seemed...
- Happy
He is full of joy
Ludwig wants to get married
He wanted me to let you know
He also wants you to come with me
to ask for the hand of the young girl
This is only fair,
because the princess is Catholic
And the request made by a Protestant
mother may not be enough
- He wants to get married?
- Princess Sophie, Elisabeth's sister
Is it not wonderful news?
Father, I feel like I am waking up
from a nightmare
A nightmare you have not helped me
much with, to tell you the truth
- Please, take a seat
- Thank you
It must be a big relief
I hope...
...that His Majesty has found
a stable balance
Many young men struggle
to find balance within themselves...
- An inner harmony
- He has found it
What matters is that he found it
and is getting married
I am surprised that His Majesty has
never mentioned to me his intentions
I was saying that I hope...
...that he has weighed carefully
the decision he has made
Because this choice...
...involves not only him...
...but also his spouse who,
with the blessing of the Lord...
Enough, Father Hoffman!
What matters is that they get married...
...and that the wedding is celebrated
as soon as possible
This is exactly what we all hoped for
- Am I right?
- Of course. It is a relief for all of us
And for the country
We will probably need
the papal dispensation...
...given the close relationship
between the two
Of course. I am sure
there will not be any problems,
- Their parents are cousins too
- Exactly
That is the reason why people believe
that in the Wittelsbach...
...and in the Hohenzollers family, there
have been many cases of anomalies
But as far as I know,
young Sophie enjoys good health
And His Majesty the King has never
given us any reasons to worry
We should mention certain timidities
and indispositions of His Majesty...
...so that Sophie can help him
and be understanding
Like her sisters,
Sophie will quickly learn...
...that a woman in her position does not
only have rights and privileges...
...but also duties. Many duties
My dear
- Sophie, are you happy?
- Yes, indeed
This is one of the best days of my life,
Ludwig
My dear Durckheim,
these family reunions are very tiring
My best wishes
I am very, very happy. Really
Thank you, Otto
Well done, Otto.
You are always so nice
- Nene, Matilde, ma tante...
- Elisabeth!
I am very happy too
Congratulations, mon beau-frere
My dear Otto, you are so nice
Everybody is happy. And the station
looked beautiful, with all those flags
Father
You did not think I was going
to show up? I did not either
Everything is always so complicated
So, ma tante, I have heard you will do
refurbishment work at the residence
The old residence will be renovated.
Who will be in charge of the work?
Sophie, let your voice be heard.
Sophie is not like me
I can only say if I like something or not
after it has been done
I must have a warm drink,
if you will excuse me
Thank you. I can do it myself
I was dying for a cup of tea
- We will not be living at the residence
- Will you not?
Only for a short while. As little as
possible. Until the new house is ready
What are these?
Something I have been thinking about
for a while
I would like to build a castle
Remember the Graswang Valley?
Above Oberammergau. There is also
another place that I like just as much
Maybe even more
Herrenchiemsee. I am still not sure
We could go there tomorrow, by horse
Remember Bad Ischl?
It will not be tiring, quite the opposite
So you can give me your advice
Sadly, I will not be here tomorrow.
I will be on my way to Zurich
I stopped by just to see Sophie
and give you both Franz's best wishes
And mine, of course
With the wedding approaching,
His Majesty gave the go ahead...
...to the building works
for his damned castles
I was in charge of making the King
experience certain things...
...that he was thought to be
totally new to
It was all so complicated
They told me so many things about you.
They recommended you
Who did?
Your Majesty sent his aide-de-camp
to the theatre to invite me for dinner...
...and I suddenly found myself
at the center of a big State affair
Closed carriage, curtains down
I was taken to a place full of offices
And then?
Do you want to know? Are you curious?
Thank you
There were some gentlemen
I think one of them
was sent by the archbishop
A very indiscreet person
And another one was sent...
...by Her Majesty the Queen Mother
Oh, my God, Your Majesty!
Are things always so complicated
when a king wants to make love?
For us actors it is much simpler.
A gaze is all we need
A sign like this
I have been told this too -
that you are very shy
Then they asked me a lot of questions
Even about my health
- Really?
- Really outrageous
Scandalous. And in the end...
...they appealed to my discretion
Although it doesn't apply to them,
obviously
They want to know how things went
Are you going to tell them?
With Your Majesty's permission,
I would like to deceive them all
They are too indiscreet
Curious.
We...
...could make love...
...and say that we have not done it
Or we could not do it,
and say we have done it
Yes, we must satisfy their curiosity
Let's tell them something
that will shock them
For example,
that Your Majesty spanked me
- Will they believe you?
- Your Majesty, I am a great actress
The truth is... that you will surely
go back to them
And you will tell them what did not
happen between us in every detail
- Is that why they pay you?
- No
- Is that why you do it?
- No
- No, Your Majesty. No!
- Yes, they are paying you
I am sure of it
Why would you not accept?
If you do not do it today,
somebody else will do it tomorrow
Do you think I do not know
what happens around me?
I know it. I am surrounded by people
who check everything I do
Not to protect me, but to ruin me
I have not understood yet
how they will do it, but I know they will
This is their aim
I can only watch...
...fascinated, while they move
quietly and cautiously
It is as if I was watching them...
...while they build the scaffold
on which they will hang me
No. No, Your Majesty.
This is not true
- This is not true at all
- Go away
And get them to pay you
Ask for a good sum,
more than you deserve. Go, Madame
- Prostitute!
- Your Majesty!
Why? What have I done?
Not like this, please. Please
Your Majesty, rescue me! Help me!
Rescue Madame von Buliowski,
and send her home, now
Your Majesty! Help me!
The jewels that the queens of Bavaria
have been wearing for 700 years
But I will give you a better present.
It is a secret, you cannot tell anybody
I will introduce you to Richard Wagner
Our engagement is more tiring
than a military campaign
It is a martyrdom...
...that Sophie bears
without a single complaint
She is the perfect fiancée
And she loves your music
Do you know what she is afraid of
right now?
That I ask her
to sing something for you
She is afraid of your judgment, not
only as a singer but also as a fiancée
She is convinced that by asking you
to meet her, I sought your approval
- When are you coming back?
- Soon, Sire, soon
And I will not be hiding. I will come back
with my wife and a new opera
You will save me from much sorrow,
much loneliness
Sophie is delightful...
...very pretty and sweet
For the first time I saw love
for Your Majesty in somebody's eyes
I have decided to postpone the wedding
by a month or two
I wish it had already happened. I can
already hear the crowd screaming...
...the banquets, the ceremonies,
both here and at the church
It is like a nightmare,
it keeps me awake at night
My uncles, my aunts,
my cousins from all over Europe...
...the kisses, the hand-shakes,
the wishes...
...the hugs
You can open your heart to me,
Your Majesty
My affection for you is the same as
it was the day you called me to Munich
I have not forgotten you saved me from
poverty, welcomed me into your arms
I took up your invitation right away
because I realized you needed me
Forget what happened in the past
You can betray friends,
even their trust...
...and still love them.
Be magnanimous, try to forgive
I know that nobody else can advise you
like I can...
...because my words are born
of a very honest and deep feeling
What is bothering you, my friend?
I understand many things, but I cannot
speak if you do not ask me to
My name is Richard Hornig
I worked for the King for 10 years
I became part of his staff
by chance, when His Majesty...
...in one of his moments of rage,
threw out a squire called Volk
And so I replaced him
During my years at the service of the
King, I never betrayed his trust
And I do not have any intention
of doing it today
Apart from this -
nothing in his behavior...
...was different from what everybody
considered...
...suitable behavior for a king
Wait here
- Take this! Are you able to put it up?
- Yes, Your Majesty
- Good. Very good
- I learnt it when I was in the Army
- I have not seen you before
- I started few days ago, Your Majesty
- And what did you do before?
- I worked in a farm
I looked after horses
- Light the fire
- Right away, Your Majesty
Take off your gloves!
- What are you waiting for?
- Have you got any orders for me, Sire?
If you want, you can sleep here tonight
Yes, Your Majesty
What "Elsa" are you talking about?
Who is this "Elsa"?
I am Elsa.
Ludwig does not even like my name
He never called me Sophie, only Elsa
From the very start
Like the heroine of the "Lohengrin"
What lover does not call his beloved
a different name?
Lover...
Ludwig has always been known
to be extravagant
Yes, I know. But I am in love with him
I cannot bear him leaving me on my own
during a ball organized especially for us
He never asks me to accompany him,
to go out with him
He comes to see me very rarely
and without warning
I have to spend my days indoors
so that I do not miss his visits
And when he does come to see me,
he only says a few words
Or sometimes he comes at night,
walks by the gate...
...and leaves some flowers
on the ground for me
Without a note or anything
As if he was putting them on a grave
As a matter of fact, I feel dead.
Dead and buried
And I felt dead
even when he insisted I met Wagner
Everybody gives me pitiful looks,
really pitiful
It is also your fault, Sophie
Why do you stay indoors...
...waiting for him to grace you
with his visit?
You have to lead the same life
you had before. Go to the theatre...
...travel and try to enjoy yourself!
Show him that you are an independent
woman, full of interests apart from him
This will attract him to you.
He will look for you!
Ludwig will never look for me. He does
not want me, he is not interested in me!
And you know that very well. Why did
you not tell me he was in love with you?
Why are you saying such things?
It is not true
Of course it is. Many have told me
However, I had already understood it.
Although it was too late
And if you want to know,
they told me that even you...
Who? Who told you? Do not ever
dare say anything like that again!
Sophie... please look at me
Do not believe all the nonsense
people tell you
It is not me you have to be scared of.
Neither me...
...nor any other woman
Ludwig...
The only danger for Ludwig could be...
It happens to many young men,
did you not know it?
To all of them,
when they are so young and sensitive
In the majority of cases, they get over it,
if we help them
I am very fond of Ludwig
Maybe because we are so similar,
not only physically
He does have many flaws
but also many qualities
He is very vulnerable
You can save him, Sophie. You have
to do it, but you have to be strong
You have to be there for him. Do not let
him postpone your wedding any longer
If he does not talk to you, you talk to him
If he neglects you, give him the
impression that you neglected him first
I will tell our father to write to Ludwig
to set the date immediately
He must not postpone anymore
I do not want to marry Sophie anymore
- It is too late
- No, it is not!
It is not the first time
an engagement is broken
A king cannot... must not give scandal
He cannot expose himself to awful...
...and justified criticism.
They will show you no mercy!
And this is the reason
why I should not take pity on Sophie?
Let the Lord take pity on her.
Leave her in His hands
I am deceiving her
You knew that from the beginning
She does not want to marry me
for ambition
- I did not realize that
- If Sophie is in love with you...
...you have to be happy
She loves me today, but tomorrow
she will hate me. And I will hate her
How can you be so full of arrogance?
How can you expect to know
what the Lord has in store for you?
Today you are only asked
to get married...
...and to have children
Listen to me, Ludwig
When the devil sends us
his temptations...
...we have to be able to turn them
against him
We have to be able to respond
as God would like us to
In the darkness of a room,
your sinful imagination...
...will make you realize...
...that the warmth of one body
is the same as that of any other
Father, you are teaching me
something new
For your country, for your people,
you have to be one of them
Obviously more powerful
and privileged...
...blessed by divine providence...
...but still one of them
If you want to be different,
they will never forgive you. Never
Wagner was thrown out of Munich...
...because he was a genius
In that sense, he was an outsider
He was different from the others
Ludwig, you are the favorite
of the Lord because...
...more than any other man,
you are exposed to sin
And because of this...
...more than any other man, you can
offer God the proof of your love
As you told me, I know...
...that up until now you have always had
the strength...
...to reject any temptation...
...to avoid committing sins
Yes
I want you to repeat to me
that this is still true
Yes
I am asking you once again...
...under the sacred bond
of the confession
Yes
I daresay that calling off
the engagement with Princess Sophie...
...marked the beginning
of our misfortunes
From that inauspicious day,
our King lost his interest in State affairs
Despite everything that was going on
in the world, His Majesty...
