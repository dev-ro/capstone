    Oh, sorry.                  
    I thought you were gone.    
                   Ron, this is 
                   my bathroom. 
                If you're gonna 
                stay here,      
       you're gonna             
       have to use              
       the bathroom downstairs. 
     Dad's in that one.         
                Well, then,     
                you're going to 
                have to wait.   
        How long?               
                Close the door.

 It is not a young tumor.

           Yeah, you should     
           really call more,    
           you know.            
 So, what did you do?           
          I didn't do anything. 
 Well, then,                    
 why did you get fired?         
        The business has been   
        operating at            
        a loss for over a year. 
         Dad's about            
         three weeks away       
         from total bankruptcy. 
         When I confronted him  
         about it, he fires me. 
   Wait. What?                  
   Are you kidding me?          
                Just don't say  
                anything, okay? 
            He made me promise  
            not to tell anyone. 
   He doesn't want Mom          
   to worry about it right now. 
     Well, what's he            
     going to do?               
                  I don't know. 
        Medical bills are       
        going to be crazy.      
   They don't have any savings. 
   They're totally screwed.     
 Oh, my God.                    
 Oh, my God.                    
         (MUSIC STOPS)          
           So, how's Rebecca?   
 She's good.                    
                 Yeah?          
        Mom said things         
        haven't been great.     
         Is that why you're not 
         going to get married?  
  I don't even know             
  why you would say that. I...  
             Do you think       
             your kid will mind 
             being a bastard?   
     Okay, first of all,        
     I'm pretty sure            
     people don't think         
     like that anymore.         
  And, uh, two, no.             
  I don't... I don't know.      
                   You sure?    
    Well, I'll ask him          
    when he gets here.          
    What are you doing?         
               Stacey started   
               seeing somebody. 
 This is Stacey's house?        
           Yeah.                
 Ron, you divorced her,         
 like, years ago.               
           I agreed to divorce. 
 I didn't agree to              
 some strange man               
 hanging around my daughters.   
    Okay, Ron, we got to go.    
    This is...                  
       Oh, shit! Get down!      
       Get down!                
 What? What? What is it?        
        John, get down.         
    What?                       
      He's at the window.       
 Oh, my God, mine doesn't work. 
           RON: What?           
 Mine doesn't work.             
   Don't grab... Put it down.   
 My seat doesn't work.          
 My seat...                     
 He's coming.                   
 He's coming.                   
   He's coming.                 
   He's coming.                 
     RON: He's coming over?     
    RON: Is he coming over?     
 Oh, my God, Ron.               
 I'm going to kill you.         
 I'm going to kill you.         
 This is very...                
       RON: Just be cool.       
 This is very                   
 upsetting to me.               
         RON: Be cool.          
 This is, uh...                 
 This is not good. This...      
              Hey.              
          Hey there, Ron.       
          How you doing?        
           RON: Fine.           
 Wait. You guys                 
 know each other?               
                      Yeah.     
 He's the new youth pastor      
 over at Mom and Dad's church.  
           Reverend Dan.        
           Nice to meet you.    
      Hey, whoa.                
        Whoa.                   
 Hey. John Hollar.              
 I'm embarrassed.               
             I heard about      
             your mother.       
           I'm very sorry.      
 Oh, thank you very much.       
 That's nice of you to say.     
 How is she?                    
      You know, I think...      
                  She's fine.   
              No thanks to you. 
         Well, he didn't        
         do anything, Ron.      
         Yeah? How do you know? 
         He's supposed to       
         talk to God, isn't he? 
       Maybe he put in an order 
       for a brain tumor        
       or something.            
 I'm afraid that's not          
 how it works there, Ron.       
             Oh, yeah? (LAUGHS) 
         How does it work,      
         Reverend Dan? Tell us. 
          Well, I'm just        
          a youth pastor, so... 
       (RON SCOFFS)             
   Really?                      
   What's the matter?           
    Couldn't get a job          
    as an adult pastor?         
           No, I just...        
           Yeah. I like kids.   
 That's nice.                   
           Yeah? That's creepy. 
           That's creepy.       
         Yeah, look, Ron, uh... 
    I know you're going through 
    a hard time right now,      
  okay?                         
            Oh, really? You do? 
 Yeah, yeah, I do.              
 And I appreciate               
 that very much.                
 However...                     
                      Yeah?     
          Stacey was wondering  
          if you could maybe... 
          Stop parking out      
          in front of the house 
          and staring at her    
          with your binoculars. 
                   Yeah?        
              Well, fuck you,   
              Reverend Dan!     
      (ENGINE SPLUTTERING)      
 What happened?                 
         I don't know.          
             I mean, it sounded 
             like you...        
        You have                
        a broken T-chain there. 
      I could... I mean,        
      I could take a look at it 
      for you if you want.      
         That would be helpful. 
         Thank you.             
           Yeah.                
             Pop the hood.

   What time is it?             
 JOHN: It's 8:00.               
       Oh, shit, shit.          
 Shit, I'm late for work. Shit. 
 JOHN: No,                      
 don't worry about it.

            I know.             
               (SNIFFLES)       
             Yeah.              
 And he's gone,                 
 so you can stop pretending.    
                Thank God.      
        How you doing?          
            He cried all night. 
            If I didn't know    
            any better,         
          I'd think             
          he was the one        
          with the brain tumor. 
 I think he might be            
 going through                  
 a little something, so...      
          Ron told you we're    
          about to go bankrupt? 
 Come on.                       
 He said no one knew.           
       I keep the books.        
 Is he gonna be all right?      
                I don't know.   
                I don't know.   
 Well, I brought breakfast.     
        Pretzels and ice cream? 
   If you don't want it,        
   I can just...                
           No, no, no.          
      I'm not saying that.      
 So, how you doing?             
                  I feel great. 
 You know, I've been            
 googling brain tumors.         
 A lot more common              
 than you'd think.              
                     Yeah?      
       Yeah.                    
 Did you know                   
 Bob Marley had one?            
            How'd that work out 
            for him?            
    Well, he sold               
    a lot of records,           
 so... Got a little             
 catching up to do.             
         (BOTH CHUCKLE)         
 You're gonna be okay, Mom.     
 You'll get through this.       
 I mean, even                   
 the procedure seems simple.    
 Just a tiny little hole        
 in your skull,                 
 and they go in and...          
                    John.       
                 How's Rebecca? 
 She's good, you know...        
           JASON: Oh.           
                Hello. (LAUGHS) 
                   What's this, 
                   Mrs. Hollar? 
       We're having some        
       ice cream for breakfast? 
 Ice cream and pretzels,        
 one of my mom's                
 favorite things.               
           Yeah. Hey, how 'bout 
           heart attacks?       
          Is that one of her    
          favorite things, too? 
    No. What? Why?              
         Why? Well, because     
         your mother's          
         a borderline diabetic. 
 That's not true, is it?        
                   Maybe.       
             JASON: Yeah. Yeah. 
    No, it is. So this          
    probably wasn't             
    the best idea, was it, pal? 
          I'm gonna take these. 
  And, believe it or not,       
  we actually keep our patients 
        on a pretty strict diet 
        for a reason.           
 Sorry. I was just trying to do 
 something nice for her, so...  
          Next time,            
          like, try a gift card 
         or something harmless, 
         you know?              
              (LAUGHS)          
 I'm sorry, do you have         
 a problem with me or...        
           I don't know. Maybe. 
          Want... Want a little 
          chat in the hall?     
                We'll find out. 
   I'll be right back.          
 What's going on, man?          
    Uh, "What's going on, man?" 
            Well, Gwen has been 
            asking about you,   
            like, nonstop       
            since she found out 
            your mom was here.  
 Yeah. No, I heard              
 you guys were...               
                   Married?     
       Yeah.                    
                 Yeah. Yeah.    
 Congratulations.               
            She just had a kid, 
            too, so...          
 Well, you both                 
 have a kid, so that...         
 That's awesome.                
 Congratulations for            
 both of you, right?            
            Dude, please,       
            can we cut the shit 
            here for a second?  
    Yeah.                       
          I mean, like, are you 
          gonna try anything?   
     What?                      
              Are you gonna try 
              anything with her 
          while you're in town? 
  No, no, no.                   
 No. No, no, no.                
                  Yeah?         
 No, I... I have                
 a great girl in New York,      
 and we're actually             
 about to have a baby, so...    
             Oh, great.         
             So you're married. 
  Uh, no.                       
  No, we're not.                
      I thought you said you... 
      You're gonna have a baby. 
 I did say I was                
 gonna have a baby, but...      
 I'm not married.               
    Well, why aren't            
    you getting married         
    if you're gonna have a kid? 
 Well, it's a long story.       
 You know, we talked about it.  
 But, uh...                     
 Why does that matter?          
                  I don't know. 
          I'm just saying,      
          like, don't you think 
    your kid's gonna resent you 
    for making it a bastard?    
 It's not gonna be              
 a bastard.                     
      Technically,              
      the kid will be a...      
      That's what a bastard is. 
 Point is, I...                 
 I haven't had any              
 feelings for Gwen.             
 Not for a long, long time.     
   So...                        
                  Yeah.         
          She still looks good. 
 I... Bet she does.             
               Like, great.     
 Okay.                          
      You know,                 
      maybe better than before. 
 I don't even know              
 what that means, but...        
        In that case,           
        you want to get dinner? 
       What?                    
                Tomorrow night. 
           Gwen wanted me       
           to invite you to     
           dinner at our house. 
       That's why               
       we're chatting out       
       here in the hall.        
 Um, yeah, no, I...             
 Yeah, that would be nice.      
            All right, good.    
            Well, I'll let her  
            know you're coming. 
 Great. All right, well,        
 it was good to see you.        
                This is good.   
 Yeah? Glad you like it.        
             It's a nice combo.

  Where is everyone?            
                    Not here.   
 Well, where are they?          
                Called in sick. 
        Everyone?               
            Mmm-hmm.            
              Why?              
      I'm guessing it           
      had something to do with  
            not getting paid    
            for two weeks.      
 Well, don't they               
 know about Sally?              
        Unfortunately, guilting 
        people into free labor  
        only works on family.   
 I wish I had more sisters.     
                 Yeah, me, too. 
               How's she doing? 
 (SOBS) I don't know.           
 I better go check on her.      
      No, I'll go check on her. 
      You need to get to work.  
       We got an order          
       this morning, thank God. 
 All right. Here.               
 Take this card                 
 and pay everyone               
 for last week.                 
         You can't afford that. 
 Just do it anyway.             
 And tell 'em to get            
 their asses back to work.      
                    Okay.       
 What about your                
 cartoon story?                 
         They don't call it     
         a cartoon story, Mom.  
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.          
 I mean, what's it called?      
               A graphic novel. 
      How is it?                
                     (SIGHS)    
            Let's face it, Mom, 
            I made a mistake.   
             I'm not an artist. 
 And that's okay.               
                Rebecca sent me 
                some of it.     
    Oh, my God,                 
    she did not.                
          She says she thinks   
          you should try        
          and get it published. 
 Yeah. I bet she does.          
                 Why don't you? 
    Because, Mom,               
 you know, sometimes            
 things aren't good enough.     
                I like Rebecca. 
                 She's pushy.   
      Yeah.                     
         Men need to be pushed. 
           You know,            
           when your father and 
           I first got married, 
           we lived in Detroit. 
        He worked in            
        a small office downtown 
               next to          
               the Fox Theatre. 
     I'd pick him up every day. 
     He never really knew why.  
     Your father would          
     get off work at 5:00,      
        and I'd leave our       
        apartment at 3:00       
   and walk down to the Fox.    
    There was never             
    a show on at that time.     
         And I'd go in          
      and I'd sit in            
      one of those seats.       
        And I'd look up         
        at the ceiling.         
                      It was... 
                Unlike anything 
                I'd ever seen.  
 And this enormous chandelier.  
           It was breathtaking. 
                 And every day, 
                 I'd go back,   
           I'd go in,           
         and I'd look up.       
      You've never              
      told me that story.       
   I never really got a chance  
   to pursue anything creative. 
    I was so young when I       
    married your father,        
    and then Ronnie came along. 
             So...              
    Do you ever wish you        
    did anything different?     
      Oh, yeah, big-time.       
 Really?                        
        Definitely. Definitely. 
           Like what?           
         I'm not sure           
         I ever should have     
         married your father.   
         Wait. What?            
            Grandma!            
            Grandma!            
 Girls! Oh, my goodness!        
           Oh, what are you two 
           doing out of school? 
 I don't want you               
 to die, Grandma.               
 Don't you worry                
 about that.                    
    But, Dad said you will.     
    Well, what does he know?    
        We brought              
        pretzels and ice cream. 
     Oh, that is so sweet.      
      CONSTANCE:                
      Whoa, grandma,            
      is that your tumor?       
          Oh, come here, honey, 
          and give me a hug.    
       Okay. I'm gonna go       
       for a drive, so...       
     Do you need anything?      
              I wouldn't mind   
              a bag of Doritos. 
              I was asking Mom. 
 No, honey, I'm fine.           
      Okay. Great.              
      I'll be right back, okay? 
               See you guys

  Oh, thank God you're there.   
 It is so good to               
 hear your voice.               
   REBECCA:  Hey. How are you?  
   Not so good.                 
     Uh, Doctor wants           
     to do a craniotomy         
     by the end of the week.    
         Dad is... Gonna lose   
         his business, I think. 
      And... Mom said           
      she actually thinks       
      she regrets marrying him. 
     It's been great.           
     And on top of it all,      
     my mom's nurse hates me.   
          Wait, why does your   
          mom's nurse hate you? 
       Who knows?               
       It's just some jackass   
       from high school.        
      Well, what's his problem? 
      You need me to            
      come down there?          
        I don't know, you know? 
        Nothing.

 Well, it's not                 
 my Gwen anymore.

 Well, no, yeah, but...         
 Oh, boy.                       
    Look, Rebecca, don't worry. 
    Nothing is gonna happen.    
         I don't feel anything  
         for her anymore, okay? 
   I mean, she just had a baby, 
   for God's sake.              
         Oh. Yeah.              
 Oh. What an incredibly...

 say to me right now.           
             No, that's not     
             what I meant. I...

 Are you smoking?               
     No. Yes.                   
         You don't smoke.       
       Can you just put         
       that out, please,        
          and just call me      
          a little later?

          No, I... It... I'm...

              Us.               
       You and me and...        
 The girls.                     
      Are you kidding me?       
         I just wasn't ready.   
  I know you think              
  you're hot shit               
 ever since you                 
 moved to New York,             
 but don't be                   
 an asshole, okay?              
 This guy's got                 
 Mom's life in his hands.       
                 What are you   
                 talking about? 
                  I don't think 
                  I'm hot shit. 
 Sure you do. You think         
 you're better than us.         
 That's why you never call.     
                   Here we go.  
                   I don't call 
          just because          
          I don't use the phone 
          that much anymore.    
 You used to call               
 Gwen all the time.             
         She was my girlfriend! 
     It's okay.                 
 It's okay.                     
 I understand. Leave it.        
               Understand what? 
    You're jealous.             
            (CHUCKLING) Of you? 
            You live in Mom     
            and Dad's basement. 
 You resent me, don't you?      
 You resent all of us.          
 That is why you                
 moved so far away.             
            I moved to New York 
            because there's     
            nothing here.       
 There's nothing here?          
                Well, whatever. 
 Yeah. Yeah, whatever.          
 I don't care, either.          
 Just don't offend              
 this guy, okay?                
      How can I help you?       
 Yes, thank you                 
 for taking the time.           
 My brother and I               
 were just wondering            
          if you could          
          explain the procedure 
          a little bit more...  
 I wasn't wondering.            
 I trust you.                   
 My mom and dad                 
 trust you, too.                
      Um, well, thank you.      
         The procedure.         
          JOHN: Yeah.           
  So, what we plan on doing...  
                  I took karate 
 as a kid.                      
                  Ron.          
 My instructor                  
 was actually black,            
 but I'm pretty sure            
 he spent some time in China.   
                   Why?         
 With the Chinese.              
  Well, I'm Taiwanese Laoshan.  
             Taiwanese Laoshan. 
          So, doesn't apply.    
                 Doesn't apply. 
 You're lotion?                 
  It's pronounced "Lau Shan."   
  What martial art              
  do you do?                    
              None.             
                   None.        
      None?                     
      Okay, so the difficulty   
      here is                   
     that the tumor is          
     taking up a large part...  
 Does it help to                
 have small hands?              
        You're a very busy guy. 
 In... In the surgery?          
           Thank you so much    
           for taking the time, 
 and we really appreciate       
 all you're doing for our mom.  
      You're offending!         
           Hey, Gwen.           
            Oh, hey.            
              Hey.              
       (KNOCKING ON DOOR)       
        This is for you.        
         (BABY CRYING)          
                 Oh, hey, man.  
              Hey.              
 What are you doing here?       
             You... You invited 
             me to dinner.      
          What day is it today? 
    I'm just busting            
    your balls, man.            
                Oh, that right? 
     Yeah.                      
                     All right. 
 Are those for Gwen, or...      
               No, they're...   
               Well, yeah.      
    They're for both of you,    
    so, you know, there you go. 
        (SNICKERS)              
             Yeah.              
 All right, well, I'll find     
 a nice place for these.        
  Come on in.                   
  Gwen's getting ready, and...  
             Great.             
          Yeah, do...           
 Nice house.                    
               Beautiful place. 
  Thanks. Yeah.                 
                  Look out.     
 Is that your baby?             
 Nah, real kid's                
 in the fridge.                 
  It's just                     
  a screaming decoy.            
    (BOTH CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)    
               What's, uh...    
               What's the name? 
      Quinn.                    
   Oh, yeah.                    
            He's adorable.      
 No, it's a she.                
                   Oh.          
 We named her after             
  Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,    
 you know,                      
    because... 'Cause it        
    seemed like a funny idea    
 at the time.                   
           It's good.           
           I think it's clever. 
 You don't really think         
 that far ahead and then...     
        Yeah. It's a good show. 
 It's the kid's                 
 name forever, but...           
             Yeah.              
  Yeah. You want a beer, or...  
         I'd love that.         
   All right.                   
       Thank you so much.       
  You got it.                   
             Now, is she okay?  
    'Cause she seems upset.     
        No, she's good.         
  The crying's actually, like,  
  good for kids' lungs.         
 It makes them                  
 strong or something,           
 you know.                      
           Oh, all right.       
           Well, I don't think  
           that's true.         
 Right?                         
 Hi. You okay?                  
 You okay?                      
              She likes you.    
           Hey.                 
                  Hey.          
  Wow, you look...              
  Beautiful.                    
                Well, I look... 
                Different.      
 So, how are you?               
             Good. Good.        
             Little weird to    
             be home, you know? 
    You have                    
    an amazing-looking child... 
        Your husband's          
        right in the kitchen.   
 Yeah. It's not working out.    
 But, he could come in,         
 and any moment...              
                  I missed you. 
 I missed you, too.             
              You should have   
              called me.        
       (BOTTLES POPPING)        
    I know.                     
 Have you ever read this?       
               Yes, that is     
               my favorite one. 
             Yeah, I thought    
             you might like it. 
   Yeah.                        
    Really? I think             
    that book's depressing.     
       Oh, you think            
       everything's depressing. 
        Well, you've seen       
        Seven, right?           
                  I have, yeah. 
           Whatever.            
     How did you get            
     Quinn to stop crying?      
                  Oh, I didn't. 
                  John did it.  
    Oh, what, are you, like,    
    some kind of baby           
    whisperer guy, or...        
                   Mmm. No. No. 
 Jason can never get            
 her to stop crying.            
    JOHN: Oh, really?           
    Well, that's                
    probably just bad luck.     
        Yeah, I mean...         
      It's just bad luck.       
 You hungry?                    
                      Starving. 
 Yeah, let's eat.               
                 Okay, great.   
          Here you go.          
                  Thanks.       
     Okay, kiddo,               
     it's bedtime for you.      
     You want...                
        (QUINN WAILING)         
      Are you kidding me?       
      It was really good.       
      Thank you very much.      
 So, uh, what's the story       
 with your girlfriend?          
 Why didn't she                 
 come back with you?            
          Girlfriend?           
   Mmm.                         
  Oh, yeah,                     
  I didn't tell you?            
              No.               
 Yeah. No, they're gonna        
 have a kid together            
 and everything.                
            Oh, wow.            
     Wow. Congratulations.      
                   Thank you.   
                 Thank you.     
      So, when's she due?       
               Soon, very soon. 
 They're not even married.      
                     Hmm.       
          Well, you know, we... 
   Really wanting a bastard,    
   so we got it.                
 I proposed to Gwen the second  
 I saw the pregnancy test       
 in the trash.                  
 I jumped on it,                
 'cause you don't               
 want to, you know...           
               That's romantic. 
     Yeah.                      
        So, how'd you meet her? 
       At a comic book store,   
       actually.                
 Oh, she like a...              
 Like a nerd or...              
               No, she's, uh... 
               Adorable.        
 Okay. (CHUCKLES)               
 What she do?                   
         She has her            
         own company, actually. 
                Oh, doing what? 
      She designs pet clothing. 
      So, just collars and hats 
      and sweaters and...       
                      Nice.     
 JASON:                         
 Oh, you can make a living      
 designing pet clothing         
 in New York?                   
 That's...                      
         No, not... Not really. 
 Um, I don't                    
 understand then.               
                  Her parents   
                  are rich-ish. 
      Hmm.                      
     How rich?                  
                They bought her 
                a brownstone    
                for graduation. 
              Wow.              
 Okay. Well, now I see          
 why you don't want             
 to get married.                
                   (LAUGHING)   
                   Why is that? 
 Mmm. Well, it's like,          
 what's the point, really?      
 Going through                  
 all that, you know?            
 Getting everything             
 you want out of it,            
 and she's taking               
 care of you, so...             
          GWEN: Jason.          
  What?                         
      Well, no, no, it's not... 
      It's not like that.       
          I mean, we keep our   
          money separate, so... 
 But you don't have             
 any money.                     
                  You're drunk. 
 So?                            
              So go do          
              the dishes, okay? 
      Okay.                     
 Right. Okay. Sure.             
 You don't have                 
 any money, right?              
                Jason.          
    Okay.                       
 Hmm. (CHUCKLES)                
      (CELLPHONE RINGING)       
          John! Oh, my God!     
       I haven't heard from     
       you in, like, two days!  
       I've been worried!       
         JOHN:  Rebecca,        
         I just saw Gwen.       
       I went over to her       
       house for dinner,        
      her and her husband,      
      he was there.             
      And okay, honey,          
      I'll just tell you,       
      she kissed me!            
                   Okay.        
                Okay, so...     
                You kissed her? 
   No, no, no,                  
   she kissed me.               
  Whoa. No.                     
  Major difference.             
              Major.            
  I just thought that you said  
  you didn't have               
  feelings for her anymore,     
        and she just had a kid. 
 I don't. She did.              
 Oh, by the way,                
 she still looks great!         
 Meant to tell you that,        
 so, you have nothing           
 to worry about.                
                Dude, what?     
       John, you sound          
       like a basket case.      
       No. No, no.              
       I know exactly what      
       I'm saying, I promise.   
  REBECCA: You're not making me 
   feel very secure right now.  
  I know.                       
  I know, but I will.           
  I will, starting right now.   
          Are you drunk?        
 A little bit, but no,          
 that's not why                 
 I'm saying this.               
 Rebecca, what I'm              
 trying to tell you is...       
 I love you.                    
          I love you,           
           and I don't know,    
           I just wanted you    
           to know that.        
         I love you, too.       
                  Dad?          
 Hey, Johnny,                   
 what's going on?               
       What are you doing here? 
              John?             
     I'm working.               
              John?             
              Rebecca, I have   
              to call you back. 
      Are you kidding me, John? 
 (SIGHS) Dad,                   
 I can give you                 
 some money.                    
      Don't be ridiculous.      
      You don't have any money. 
 Rebecca has some money...      
          I'm not going to take 
          any money from her.   
               John, come on.   
        You got your own family 
        to worry about now.     
          I'll figure this out. 
      How?                      
        Well, I'll, you know... 
  Dad... How?                   
                   Well...      
                    I'm sorry.  
            That I didn't spend 
            more time with you  
            growing up.         
  Come on, Dad,                 
  you know I don't              
  care about that.              
              Yeah, well, I do. 
       Johnny, it's terrifying. 
 It's not that bad.             
 How much do you owe?           
              No, not that, no. 
         It's terrifying        
         to find out            
         this late in your life 
              what you          
              should have done. 
                       Wow.     
    We still have time.         
             I tried, you know. 
             I did try.         
          You got to know that. 
       I do.                    
                   Yeah.        
           (THUDDING)           
    John.                       
                  John.         
       Hi.                      
                    Hi.         
              Is this a dream?  
    No.                         
 Why is he wearing              
 my mother's robe?              
                     Hi.        
                I'm Ron, uh,    
                John's brother. 
              It is so good to  
              finally meet you. 
        JOHN: Hey, Ron?         
 Yeah.                          
              I think we got it 
              from here, bud.   
              Sure. Okay. Yeah. 
      Hi.                       
                     Hi.        
         So, don't ever hang up 
         on me again, okay?     
             No, I won't.       
    Okay.                       
                    Oh!         
       Wait.                    
 How did you get here?          
                 I took a cab.  
 How far is that?               
                  Far.          
 JOHN: Wow.                     
      Oh, what are these?       
      I was thinking maybe      
      some wallpaper            
      for the baby's room.      
 I read somewhere that          
 babies like contrast.          
                   (CHUCKLES)   
       They're beautiful.       
 I missed you so much.          
       I really missed you. Oh. 
      How are you feeling?      
 My ass is really sore.         
      JOHN: Cannot believe      
      you took a cab here.      
        (MUSIC PLAYING)

        Hey.                    
      Dad?                      
           Hi, angels.          
       What are you doing here? 
        I missed you guys.      
         Did you miss me?       
      Yeah.                     
        Yeah. Can I come in?    
                    (GIGGLES)   
       Yeah.                    
         I'm coming in.         
 But, Mom said that...          
        Don't...                
        Don't worry about Mom.  
        Move... Move that.      
                 Okay.          
               Coming in.       
                Okay. Ow.       
             Okay. Here we go.  
                I'm good. Okay. 
            (CLANG)

               Okay.            
                 Okay.          
             Hi. Hi-ho.

          Get in here.          
        Oh, my goodness.        
       I missed you guys.       
         I missed you.          
          I love you.           
         Whoa, oh...            
           What? What is it?    
         Oh.                    
             Oh.                
     Is it... Is it a kick?     
       No, it felt like a stab. 
   Is that normal?              
          I don't know.         
               Oh!              
    Oh, my God.                 
   It's from being              
   in the car so long.          
          I don't think         
          that's what that is.  
      That's not helping.       
        Okay.                   
     Is this real?              
        Well, it feels real.    
 All right. Sorry. Yep.         
            Ah! Ooh!            
     Yep.                       
             Okay...            
      Constance.

 Wake up, it's time for school. 
  What the hell                 
  are you doing here?           
 Okay, okay, just hear me out.  
     Ron!                       
            Stacey, please.     
        (BABIES CRYING)         
      John?                     
              How is she?       
 She's fine.                    
 She just needs to rest.        
                 Oh, good.      
 You can take her               
 home tomorrow.                 
                Thank you.      
       And the... Baby is okay? 
  Their vitals are good.        
               "Their vitals"?  
             Did you know we    
             were having twins? 
         Yeah.                  
             And you didn't     
             tell me because... 
 It was the same day,           
 when we found out              
 about your mom.                
       And...                   
 Honestly, with everything      
 you've been going through,     
  I can't even tell             
  if you want to                
  have a baby at all.           
 So I thought                   
 if you knew that               
 it was two, you'd...           
 It would be too much.          
            Wait. "Everything   
            I'm going through"? 
 You're not happy, John.        
 It's obvious.                  
 At work, in your life and...   
  I don't know,                 
  maybe with me.                
 And I know that you're...      
                 No, I...       
 Just going                     
 through something and          
 maybe everything               
 in your life isn't             
 exactly what you               
 want it to be right now.       
 Um, and you're scared          
 and I get that.                
 Having a baby is scary.        
 And you think that             
 everything's                   
 gonna change and...            
 We're not gonna be fun anymore 
 and you're not gonna           
 drink beer with your friends   
 and you're gonna               
 have to be stuck in            
 this job that you hate         
 and you're not gonna           
 kiss your                      
 high school sweetheart         
 ever again...                  
           Becca, that's not... 
   No, I'm saying...            
 I'm saying it's fine.          
 And we're gonna                
 work through all of it         
 and you don't need to worry.   
      Okay?                     
             That's not what    
             I'm worried about. 
     Okay. It's not?            
                         No.    
             I don't care       
             about any of that. 
             Having twins is... 
      Is one more person and... 
              That's one more   
              person that...    
          I'm gonna be failing. 
          And I just don't know 
          if I can take that.   
         What?                  
  Is that what you think?       
            I don't know, yeah. 
 I didn't drive eight hours     
 'cause you were failing me.    
 I came here 'cause I need you  
       so much.                 
 I'm just waiting               
 for you to come back.          
                    Okay.       
              (SNIFFLES) Okay.  
 I need you                     
 to get me out of               
 this hospital, though.         
                      Okay.     
      For real.                 
                      Okay.     
  I'm not having two of         
  your enormous babies          
 without my doctor,             
 you monster.                   
                      Okay.     
 I'm not doing it.              
 It's not funny.                
      You are not allowed       
      in this house again       
  under any circumstance,       
  do you understand?            
           Come on, Stacey,     
           don't you think      
           you're overreacting? 
     Watch the flowers, please. 
                Come on, man.   
     Dan, good to see you.      
                Good morning.   
           Good to see you.     
              Damn it! Damn it! 
      Oh, Jesus.                
        Oh, shit.

        Okay?                   
      You win.                  
           This isn't about me. 
   Yeah, whatever.              
          Your girls called me. 
  They called you?              
            What were you doing 
            in the house, Ron?  
 RON: I don't know!             
 I was lonely,                  
 and I... I didn't              
 know where else to go,         
   and... And they're...        
   They're my kids.             
  I mean, they're...            
  They're my kids, too.         
              Would you like    
              to talk about it? 
        No. No.                 
 I mean, kind of, but...        
              Hey, come on.     
              I'm gonna buy you 
              a cup of coffee.  
          No.                   
                      Come on.  
 No, it's okay. I'm okay.       
          I'm good.             
               Thank you, Mike. 
   Wait, you're not gonna       
   push any of that             
   Jesus shit on me, are you?   
                        No.     
   You promise?                 
        I don't force my        
        beliefs on people, Ron. 
       Really?                  
                    Really.     
 What are your beliefs?         
              (DAN LAUGHS)      
        JOHN: Mom?              
 What are you doing up?         
 Where is everyone?             
            Gone.               
 Mom, what's wrong?             
         Dr. Fong just came by. 
         And?                   
         He said they might     
         have to shave my head. 
         (LAUGHS)               
       Well, Mom,

 when you said                  
 you might have                 
 regretted marrying Dad?

 Must've been the tumor.

       You never met my mother. 
                 She was tough. 
             Quiet, but tough.  
    The day I married your dad, 
         she only had one piece 
         of advice for me.      
         "Don't waste your time 
         with the bad.

        Your father and I       
        have lived through      
        38 good years together.

     ¶ Summer gone,             
     now winter's on its way    
  ¶ I will miss the days we had 
        ¶ The days we had       
  ¶ I will miss the days we had 
        ¶ The days we had       
         ¶ Oh, I'll miss        
         the days we had        
    ¶ Loving, leaving,          
    it's too late for this now  
        ¶ Such esteem           
        for each has gone       
     ¶ Has time                 
     driven our season away?    
         ¶ Cause that's         
         the way it seems       
      ¶ In the world of         
      the speech that is new    
   ¶ I'll be back again to stay 
         ¶ Again to stay        
   ¶ I'll be back again to stay 
         ¶ Again to stay        
 ¶ I'll be back again to stay ¶
