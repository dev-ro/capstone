A sign of bravery
Munna, give us a treat.

What else do you want, sir?
Do you want chicken or mutton, sir?

You vomit on just smelling it.
Hey, actual thing isn't there.
- Then, you sponsor it.
He'll never take out his purse.
- Shut up, free loader.
Wait, we'll find a foolish donkey,
Iet's put the burden on him.
Drink in drops or else it'll
get over quickly.
Hey, Tata Sumo.
Park little aside.
What a great smile she

ln fact, she's thinking
about me now.
Look, a man here's floating in
imagination in slow motion.
lf you give us a treat,
is she yours?
She's common to all till she
falls for anyone of us.
Who's the smartest kid

You don't know English.?
There's no chance of getting her.
You've a squint.

Only whisky. That's why...
What's that sir?
lf we stir with it

lt's good on our liver.
Morning, you'll have free motion.

failures in life.
You've learnt many
Iessons in life.

We call it as O.B.
'O' has the same meaning.
'B' is 'Bhajana' (yesmen).
All 5 trying for the same girl?
- Yes, sir.
You'll not get results

Good idea
Then, we'll go tomorrow and
talk to her individually.
Brothers! Love means...
He's going into flash back.
Let's escape.
Nice meeting you, sir.

burden of my heart.
Or else vomit here all that
you've loaded freely here.
Pour out your heart.
Bring a half bottle for him.
l fell madly in love with a girl.
Did she die?

This is little too much.

good opportunities.
Not only that l got all night
duty job also locally
Fear of missing her in evenings,
l gave up that also.

You thought you'll find
a job in her lap only.
This is what you call as

Suddenly one day,
She came and said l've got

it'll never like any other girl.
Didn't you like this?
l've understood one thing
from your behavior.
No need of this
Iove and it's pain.
Why to fall in love and
then feel later?
Losing concentration and
spoiling our studies, is it necessary?
lf you insists on loving

Why are you all silent?
Hey Fatso! L'm asking you.
Go, Harini.
Shall we put an end here only?

To try your tricks on them
Then, do you want us to

Do you think am l a broker?
Won't you do this for
our friendship?
You're making me agree brilliantly.
But, modern girls are very clever.
They'll not fall so easily
for guys like you.
Never under estimate
the ability of boys
lf they decide on a girl...
even if she's Aishwarya Rai,
They'll trap her in just 6 months.
Isn't it?
Let us see. - When?
Tomorrow noon show

You must buy tickets.
When did girls ever took out
money from their purses?
Why did you buy 20 tickets?
10 tickets for us and 10 tickets
to be sold in black market.
Black?
lf we sell Rs.30 ticket for Rs.60
we'll get back our investments!.
We can watch movie free.
Those boys.
That side! - Then, let's

Still there is balance.
- Go & deposit in a bank.
Hey, what's this?
Do you consider yourself
to be a hero?
Our punch & your face
will get shattered.
Brother, why are you beating us?
Finding our area boy alone, will you

No, it's not paining.

lt's paining.
Come; let's call the Manager.

Catch them... catch them.
Be careful.
Good punishment for showing
our buts that day
Rub it with your hands.
Who are those guys?
Tarun, who came after
you that day
His henchmen
Just a sorry only.
Or else, do you want a treat
for getting beaten up?
We don't want a treat
but a date.
Bloody bird watchers!
lt's our mistake to have
saved them.
Even after getting up thrashed,
your pride is still intact.
We got thrashed up for you only
isn't it, Harini?
You knocked me down
with your sentiment.
l feel pity on them.
Okay, let's go.
Where? Shall we go? - Sans.
Just a bye... bye only.
- What else?
Can't you rub at the place
l was injected?
Go home, your mother will rub.
We'll meet for
Iunch at san tine.
l don't want, Munna.
Keep it with yourself.
Why?
lf l take kerchief as gift,
Our friendship will
come to an end
What exercises do you do to
keep your body glamorous.
What for this?
- To keep your waist line thin.
This one.
To improve size.
l've seen in ladies hostel
they'll do like this to improve.
That is for developing firmness.
What'll girls do if they
get 'those' feelings?
We'll cry.
Not that feelings.
...but 'wet' feelings.
Fatso! You'll get bashed up.
Tell me, dear.
What we'll do?
We'll cross legs & sit tight.
Mischievous boy
Allah for Muslims
Christ for Christians
Shiva for Hindus
You're for me
lf 6 letters can be called as
Poem, then it's 'Harini'.
lf 3 letters can be called as Love
then, it's 'you'.
Very good
l've written my thoughts.
lf the girl who loves you reads it,
she'll be very happy.
My heart wished...
No. - Why?
l'm not feeling hungry.
Not feeling hungry
or 'silencer'?
lt'll make fear vanish.
It's a little tragedy.
lt's a great tragedy.
...silence...
Yuck! Lt's an embarrassment.
For this climate another
cool drink would've been good.
Didn't l say no?
- Gave a little jerk.
Hey, clean your mouth.
With whose permission you
barged into my heart?
Will you add my name as
your lover with your name?
Don't make boys to yearn.
Don't wear a helmet
on your heart.
Don't put a full stop
to boys saying friendship.
You'll not lose chastity
if you fall in love.
Don't make girls
a chewing gum.
Don't try to put up a hut
in a girl's heart.
Don't try to excavate old things.
Don't try to show a red rose
for friendship.
Go man... Iove is just a strain
Friendship is RAC, love is
confirmation, do it my love.
There's full safety in friendship.
There's no such guarantee in love.
Friends will turn into foes, if they
spend from their own pockets.
Love will lead you to
paths of destination.
Once you fall in love
you'll never get up again.
There's love bird on the other side
They'll not take love serious...
It's a bore we don't want.
Youthful age is forcing me to do
little mischievous good things.
We don't know many things...
...it's all dash... dash...
Let's fill up the blanks.
We'll not commit any wrong doings.
But we'll be little mischief.
Our purses are empty.
Fill it up with your kisses.
Samatha, get on the bike.
- Kumar, l'll come with you.
Thank god, l'm saved
from this Dinosaur
He really bites.
- Get lost.
What's the problem
between you two?
Harini is ignoring me.
Sincerely - But, she hates love.
Can't you help me?
- L'll try.
Munna, your love will not
work out, forget her.
lt seems she'll agree if you
do a thing bravely.
What does she want me to do?
l feel ashamed to tell you.
- Tell me quickly.
Evening at 6.30 P.M.
lt seems you must cross the road
at peak hour traffic.
Oh, that's all.
Nude!
What did you say?
You mean stark naked!
lt seems you must prove that
you'll do anything for her.
She's testing me if l'm sincere or
just a time pass lover.
Will you really run naked?
You mean stark naked.
- Will you remove mustache also?
Who's mad?
You or she?
Perfectly normal.
l read in a psychology book.
lt seems girls will like if we do some
thing thrilling like this.
Munna, you're great.
After Adam, you're the one for love.
Do you want us to become walls on
4 sides holding newspapers?
lt'll be cheating.
Simple Munna
Run closing front & back
with each of your hand.
lf l do like that, it'll be
like hiding my love.
You apply odomos on your body or
else mosquitoes will bite.
Munna, l think they're
making us fools.
You were saying something.
...look there.
lf they were up to something,
would they come here?
Why did you bring us here?
You're now going to see
a super scene.
l'll take my bike and
wait at opposite side.
Samatha, did you plan
anything foolishly?
Hey, my dress
Hey Lorry! Stop please...
Stop... Iorry, my dress...
stop the lorry.
l told you'll love him if
he runs naked for fun.
l never expected
he'll do it... but...
Hey, my dress man.
Hey, stop...
Munna, get on the bike.
- Start the vehicle quickly.
What's the time now, sunny?
- L don't have a watch.
Go man - Oh, don't you've
anything on you.
Juju... police.
- Get down and push the bike.
Go quickly... quick...
- Hey, stop there boys.
Go fast... fast.
l'm going fast.
- He's catching us up.
Hey... go the wrong side.
This nuisance is coming from
the wrong side.
Go faster man.
- Watch out.
He's catching us up.
go fast... faster.
Hey, did you inform at home
before hitting the road?
Do you've any sense?
Hey look! Someone is going
naked on the bike.
Juju, go-fast, we're dead
if we are caught.
Go fast.
Die elsewhere.
You found our vehicle to get crushed.
Go man.
Bloody crooks!
Hey, catch them.
They've hit an auto.
Hey, what's all this?
lf he doesn't have sense
what happened to you all'?
ls main road any cricket ground?
To run naked.
We did the wrong.
Please sir, help us in
getting out Munna
Sampath, he's our boy.
See that the case winds up
with just a fine.
l'll pay it.
- Free case.
That's why l've bought you
half pack of cigarettes.
What's this?
Will you jump into river if
your girl friend asks you?
l'll not... - Why?
l want my life.
Tell him the truth.
Cry, shed tears saying
you did it unwittingly.
Does that girl has any sense?
Don't scold her, sir.
- Sentiment?
Did they bash you up nicely?
- Yes.
We'll have a treat
after you come out.
This boy is too much.
You've given the name
as Bellam Konda.
ls it apt name for this case?
l've doubt if this is
his real name?
You've been charged for running naked
on main road near signal.
Do you accept the charge?
Why did you do like that?
My friend challenged me
with an Rs.1000 bet.
So, l did it.
Don't you've sense?
Aren't you a college student?
Are your parents sending you
to college for doing this?
Don't you've any sense
for betting such things?
Accept a bet to get
100 marks in Mathematics.
Accept a bet to win in Tennis.
You'll get sense only if
l punish you severely.
Sir, keeping in view the future
of the youth...
You keep quiet, man.
Do you know how much property
got damaged due to him?
Sir, will he be
punished severely?
Yes, he'll be sent to
gallows... silly boy.
Under Section 294-A of l.P.C.
for this irresponsible youth,
For misbehaving in public place,
Rs.1000 fine & one day jail
term in sub-jail
And a bond of good conduct for a year...
l pass these orders.
Aren't you coming to class?
l'm not feeling well.
You carry on.
Are you happy now?
Police have arrested Munna.
Do you know that?
They beat him black & blue
Iast night in station.
He was fined Rs.1000 and
punished with one day in jail.
Even in court he refused to
reveal the truth.
Fearing spoiling your reputation &
future, he didn't tell the truth.
At least now try to understand
his love, Harini.
This cell.
God promise, l never told
to do like that.
Samatha told you like
that to fool you.
Okay, Harini.
Now, tell me seriously,
what do you want me to do?
Really!
Hey... Harini... stop
When l jumped, l hit the sky.
My feet have become birds.
Flowers bloomed from
the tip of my fingers.
My eyebrows came down
to become my moustache.
l got drowned in the
tears of happiness.
l grinned heartily.
l walked like an ant
carrying a sugar cube.
l walked on water like a leaf.
The moment l found love is the
moment l had a glimpse of God.
My heart is flying away like air.
A lightening is passing
through my nerves.
My body is shining bright
like moonlight.
When you touched the moon,
l shattered like stars.
A seed has sprouted at as
a plant from the heart.
lt has grown over my head.
l was a serene pond.
l got dried up when a
frog jumped into it.
All sand is now sugar.
Entire sea water is now
drinking water.
All shores are your footmarks.
All waves are you smiles.
The thoughts flying out of my heart
have become a book of poems
When l flew high touching
the rainbow.
Even this crow has changed
into a peacock.
l want to take a photocopy
This is what l want to
take a photocopy.
Hand? - Yes.
When this machine arrived, even the
owner put his face on it.
The copy wasn't good.
Who's your owner?
- It's me.
Look at him.
lt was my son who ran
on the road stark naked.
Do you know who made
him to do like that?
Your daughter.
lt seems your daughter
Ioves my son.
Hey, what's that non-sense?
Your daughter went to jail &
wrote this edict.
This mad boy without washing his hand.
Eating with his left hand.
He's roaming with his right hand
like a wooden doll.
Leave her.
We'll discuss about it later.
Tell us who loves whom here?
Let's finish it off here only.
They're always sitting
on that ground wall.
Shaking their legs,
smoking cigarettes.
They'll ogle & pass comments on
girls going through that street.
Now, they've started drinking
in the name of treat.
Hey, are you drinking?
- No mother.
l'm running a petty shop.
l ask him to look after the shop.
But, he'll never stay, always
sitting on that wall.
Their friendship is spoiling him.
That fool takes hours to come
out from bathroom
Ask me, what'll he do there?
He reads sex books.
Why are you insulting me
in public, daddy?
Will you go against me & talk?
Dear... please. - If l hit back,
you'll not be able to bear it.
Will you hit me?
Come on hit me.
You please sit down sir.
What's this, Krishna?
Above all this, dating.
- What's that?
They have started it newly.
Girls & boys go on bikes visiting
beaches, hotels & discos.
Eating all junk food.
After that hugging each other,
they'll kiss each other.
After ruining their lives,
they'll come back to home.
We are not such girls.
Keep quiet.
- Mother, what's all this?
We enjoy talking over
ice creams & cokes.
Look, we'll do whatever
you advise us.
They must be shown their place.
That's all.
Excuse me, can l say something?
Put some sense into
them strongly.
lt's you, who need it most now.
No use in telling these poor kids
lf people around smoke cigarettes.
He'll also feel like smoking.
lf he sees people drinking.
He'll also feel like drinking.
Not only that, if he
sees a beautiful girl
He'll definitely fall in love.
He must. No one can stop it.
ls it your good advice?
Do you want us to lock
them up in house?
What's the use of locking them up?
What is being shown on T.V.
day & night?
Take a look.
A ribbon on top an,d
a kerchief below
Calling it as modern dress,
they walk on ramp, closing & opening it.
Are they stopping with it?
Check midnight masala programs
Playing tops and making omelets
are old things
They're pouring honey into the navel
and hitting it with grapes.
Can't they watch Discovery channel
and animal Plant?
They are no better.
Take a look.
Yuck!
What's so better in this?
Mating of 2 giraffes.
We'll switch off T.V. and
come to Magazines.
Why do you want Ramba to
advertise pump set?
Why do you need a Bipasha Basu cover
for Adbul Kalam's story?
Take any magazine.
You'll find a half naked girl's
photo as the center spread.
lf you take the
art for stories.
All are with low hips & low cut jackets.
Sex in everything.
How can they stop themselves
from spoiling their thoughts?
Do you want us to be mute
witness for their ruin?
l was just telling, it is
natural in this age.
Only the wearer knows where
the shoe bites him.
Leave them.
Don't torture them.
He appears like a gentleman
but gives us advice.
Stop it boys.
Who's he? He's blabbering &
you all are listening to him.
She's my wife.
l fell in love and married her
in my student days.
Result, threats from
both our families
We lost our parental support.
My studies abruptly ended
half way through
For my needs & education,
all l got was a waiter's job.
And a kid to boot
in this situation.
l thought of begging or take help
to start a small business.
Fearing l may be forced to beg for
livelihood & milk powder.
l had to continue in my job.
Till now, l could never
settle in life.
Taking loans after 20th of every month
All this was due to this
useless love.
What he said is 1000/o true.
l too fell in love.
But, l didn't commit the mistake
he committed.
lf l fall in love while studying,
fearing my studies will get spoiled.
And future will be in jeopardy.
l sacrificed my love.
Today, l'm a custom's officer.
We are in a comfortable
position, lacking nothing.
l can buy my daughter
anything without denying her.
Why?
For sacrificing my love.
Tell me now.
Should he clean tables like me or
settle in life like him?
One side, parents who gave up
career for love.
Other side, parents who gave up
Iove for career.
But, l've lost both and
taken to drinking.
There's truth in what
they say, Munna
Parents are struggling
to educate you.
Stay away from
Iove for few days.
Press the pause button for it,
and concentrate on your studies, please.
Your friend has also told you.
Have you got it now?
Hereafter no one must
meet each other
lf college gets over at 4 P.M.
you must be at home by 4.30 P.M.
Or else you'll not get food.
Let them go to sleep without food.
If they come late, don't open the door.
lf they go against you,
cut their pocket money.
Sitting on the walls &
ogling at girls.
lf you want to do all this, go away
from there never come back to house.
Bloody crook
lf my son ever comes
to your house,
Beat him with slippers,
send dogs on him.
Did you hear him?
Stop meeting boy friends,
talking on phone for hours.
And sending e-mails.
Though we feed a dog,
with milk and mutton
When the season comes, it'll go
to mate with street dogs.
You are also like that only.
It is disgusting to see you.
Why have you come back
so early from the college?
One of my professor
died today
No college for half-day.
You go to sleep, l'll study.
ls it a love letter Krishna?
Sex story - Read aloud.
A cockroach entered into the
jacket of Malgoa Aunty cooking.
She cried aloud, Krishna!
When l entered the kitchen
Malgoa Aunty dropping her sari
upper end was jumping.
Do you all eat food or cow dung?
Get out boys.
We had advised you
so much that day.
Didn't you get any sense?
Hey, come here.
Rascal, what's that?
Will you write sex stories?
Bloody, you were born to spoil
our family. - Please don't beat him.
Stop, beating him.
- You've brought him up very nicely.
My hands are paining beating him.
Senseless creature.
Get me a can of petrol.
l'll douse him and lit fire.
He'll be reduced to ashes.
Give me a kilogram of mutton.
Give me this bulb also.
Can l make a phone call?
He had gone to bring mutton and
hasn't come back yet.
l feel like dying if l don't see
you for a second.
Go & die, bloody rogue.
l had sent you to bring mutton,
are you romancing with the girl here?
Don't you've sense?
ls your family sending you to college?
Or sending you to romance with boys?
Then, what?
Do you want me to arrange a room
and bed for you & my son?
Mother, cool down.
Why are you scolding her?
Slipper will get worn out.
Look, if l see you again
with my son.
l'll get you arrested for prostitution.
- Get lost, sambar.
Am l sambar?
Street girl... bloody street girl.
Mother, keep quiet please.
Look, what is she saying?
l'm getting abused because of you.
Bloody rogue, l'll not spare you today.
Stop... l'll... bloody rascal.
Stop... l'll not spare you.
Bloody rascal... stop.
Oh god!
Didn't l tell you not
to come here?
l came here to study.
Is it wrong?
Can't you study at home?
Can't l study at the place l like?
Don't l've that freedom also?
l know why you are sitting here.
Waiting for those dogs, isn't it?
But, only one dog has
come now, hasn't it?
Are you calling me a dog?
l'm calling myself a dog.
Go to home, bloody rogue.
lf l see you again here,
l'll kill you like a crow.
Are you calling me a dog?
Hey, stop.
College gets over at 4.30 P.M.
Why are you late to home?
K.P.R. told you don't have
any special classes.
Wait.
Daddy, that is my personal.
Only people with character can
have personal things
Who's she?
Your mother.
Please daddy.
It's my personal.
Take your hands off me.
Hey, come here.
Read this.
My dear Porcupine!
Last time when you
hugged me tightly.
A few pines got stuck
to my heart.
When l don't see you and take bath,
l feel like taking bath in Acid.
When l wipe, l feel like wiping
with emery paper.
l feel like l'm sleeping on bed
of thorns when l sleep.
When l sweat
blood is coming out.
When air touches me
l feel severe pain.
Why are our parents like this?
l don't know whether you'll hit
a nail into your father's bald head.
Or tie your mother's plait to it.
Somehow you must meet me.
l feel like millions of kisses
from my toe to head.
l'll not even consider
you as my son.
l'll pump bullets into you both.
What do you think of me?
l was surprised to see
you going to bring ration.
Are you sending messages in rice?
Clear it. - Father.
Clear it.
Clear it
Where are you seeing?
See here and pick the rice.
Pick every grain.
Why are you beating him?
- You keep quiet.
Renuka, your son's great doing.
Who did like this here?
Who else?
Our neighbor's daughter only.
He wrote a message in rice.
- Rice!
We picked up everything.
Don't give him food for a week.
He'll not come to sense until then.
Look at this print out.
Moreover a love sign in it.
No father
Father! - Hey, go...
go inside.
Father... father
Let her study in America.
We'll arrange your
marriage there only.
Are you interested?
People accept even after
6 divorces there.
She wrote just on his head,
it doesn't matter to me.
Where are you going?
To the next room, mother.
Do l need your permission
for that too?
Come here and
sign these papers.
What's that?
Why to U.S. A?
You're going to continue
your studies there only.
Harish has come
to take you there.
My semester is in November.
l told you to sign why are you
bothered about semesters?
May be she's up to some plan
of eloping with him.
Come, let's go out
They say is 6 on the
Richter scale.
lt means like our ordinary
6 inch scale.
These will be mercury in it.
It'll record it.
Don't tell lies.
Richter scale means
seismograph scale,
l too said the same thing.
Milk was boiling on stove,
suddenly it jumped & fell down.
ln fear ran out.
When did we last met, Harini?
- 10 Eras ago.
Munna, we are forced to
take a decision now.
l can't stay without you.
- Me too!
They are planning to send me
away from here.
Oh god! Where?
They told me to sign visa application.
God created an earth quake.
What was our crime for
such cruel punishment?
l feel like running
away from house.
Yes, me too
l fear they'll separate us.
Boys & girls come tomorrow
here at 5 A.M.
We all are going to Tirupathi.
- Why?
With great difficulty
she's managing to feel shy.
Look at her.
- Come & stand here.
Today it's Lord's birth star day.
Very auspicious time.
lt's your good fortune
to get married on this day.
Didn't your parents
come with you?
He's our fiend, guide,
philosopher & parent, Shastri.
l'm Sharma.
