Don't get me wrong.
I love the 49ers!
Montana and Rice?
They're Hall of Fame locks, baby.
But do they cover the spread?
Hell no.
Not like the Giants.
Let me tell you something.
You can give me Simms and Bavaro,
Meggett and L.T. any day.
Those guys are your meat and potatoes.
They fucking cover, baby.
And don't even bring up Miami. Don't.
Cause there's nothing in Miami.
Miami has nothing but Marino with a
golden arm and some fat-booty cheerleaders.
They have no running game. It's like two
virgins who can't find the damn hole.
That's why they get blitzed
all the damn time. You understand?
I can't believe you guys, man.
Yeah, they put up a ton of points,
but they cover every other week.
So take the over and bet the fucking farm.
You understand?
The pigs, the barn, the little chickens
and that tractor.
Bet all of that.
- Dallas, America's team, my sweet black ass.
- Come on.
Try to book--
Everybody and their grandmother
wanna bet the Cowboys.
Therefore they gotta win
by two touchdowns just to cover.
And what are the odds on that happening?
So dome a favor.
Take the points and run.
Come on, guys.
All right?
Unless you are a moron, retarded Saints fan.
Therefore you deserve
to get corn holed on the 50-yard-line.
- America's sport, baby-- football.
- I hate football.
Talk about my sport.
I can do any bet.
- One minute, fellas.
It's show time.
Okay, let's do it.
That's a nasty habit, man.
Go!
-Everybody, down on the ground!
-Down, get down on the floor!
- Everybody!
- Get down! Get down! Move! Let's go!
- Move!
- Come on!
What are you looking at?
Get down there!
- How long?
- Two minutes.
I see you, granny!
Get your ass out here. Come on.
Bingo.
No cameras.
- 1798.
- That's a bad year.
It's 90 seconds!
Got it.
Upstairs.
- What is that?
- Nothing. Just estate junk.
One  minute!
- It's not here.
- It's there.
- It's not here!
- It's there!
Forty-five!
My God.
Thirty seconds!
Okay, come on.
Break out the diamond. Let's see that
ten million dollar red beauty, baby!
Fucking right.
The surgeon general was right!
Cigarettes can kill!
- Go back.
- Is there a problem?
- Fucking go back!
"The psychodynamics of compulsive
stealing are well established.
"An act committed to relieve
a pre-existing state of guilt.
"An attempt to harm an imagined enemy
or a form of revenge...
"against those who have deprived the
person of something significant...
or somehow infected
a narcissistic injury."
But stealing panties
from the girls' locker room,
there's nothing in there.
I've never really been
a big fan of Freud's anyway.
I don't know if I should say this,
I'm a professional.
I won't say anything.
You promise
to keep your word?
Okay.
You know that thing that
you were doing with the panties?
Everybody does it.
Your best friends do it. The mailman,
the headmaster. They all whack off.
And if anybody tells you
they don't, they're lying.
My mom says I'm--
She says I'm oversexed.
- Now you're dead!
- Hello? Hi, Daddy.
- Hello.
- Excuse me. Who am I speaking to?
- This is me.
No, my Jessie is eight. The girl
I'm talking to is at least 11 .
Can I speak to your mother,
please?
Mom.
- Don't forget the turkey.
- Why don't you have them deliver it?
It's Thanks giving Eve, Nathan.
You might as well get the bird to fly here.
All right, okay. Fairway, right?
What's the cross street, 74th?
- The man's a steel trap.
- I will be there in ten minutes.
- Bye.
Go away.
- Come on.
Shit!
Louis?
This better be
a real emergency.
Ah, my hero! Look.
She's not one of your Dalton trust
fund waifs, but she needs your help.
I don't know.
I don't talk to you for days.
Then the night before
Thanks giving--
- Jesus Christ.
- Lucky guy's still alive.
She took a razor to this orderly
up in Rockland.111 stitches to close him up.
- What was the trigger?- Good question.
Been in and out of institutions for ten years.
I see that. Selective mutism, obsessive-compulsive
behavior,post-traumatic symptoms.
Twenty different hospitalizations,
twenty different diagnoses.
Plus an I.Q off the charts. Apparently saw her
father killed by a subway when she was eight.
- Dr. Sachs?
- What?
The girl who was biting the heads off pigeons,
she has a med student in a headlock.
Call security. Make sure the student
documents the attack and gets it co-signed.
Louis,I don't know what the hell you want
from me.I got a family home waiting.
Nathan, spend 15 minutes
with her.
She's an 18-year-old girl,
never hurt a fly until last week.
You and I are the only thing that stands between
her and a lifetime of Thorazine or worse.
Wait! What do you mean, "you and I", Kemo-sabe?
She's your patient.
You're an asshole.
Okay?
You're a big asshole
for making me say this.
You're better at this stuff than I am, okay?
You're better, you're better.
Everybody knows about Nathan Conrad and
the famous touch with the teens.
Elisabeth Burrows.This is the kind of case
you and I used to live for!
Before you went uptown on me.
Just kidding. I didn't mean it that way.
Look.
She needs you.
All right, she needs me.
But what's the emergency? Why tonight?
If we don't make some progress by Monday,
they're gonna ship her to Creedmore...
and chain her to a bed
for the rest of her natural life.
That's why.
That's why she needs you now.
Five minutes.
Five minutes!
Arnie, Frankie, good evening.
- Dr. Conrad, are you slumming tonight?
- Afraid so.
- You guys up for a cavity search?
- I'll pass.
But Dr. Sachs,
he's always ready for one.
On the gate.
- What's the new cocktail?
- Haldol, droperidol and Ativan.
- And she's awake?
- Oh, yes, she's awake.
- He told me to stay.
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Is she eating?
- Not eating, drinking, sleeping,
bathing, letting anybody touch her...
or saying a word.
- Dr. Sachs, he told me to stay.
- I'll have a word with him.
I promise, Louise.
I promise.
What's with
the heavy artillery?
Well, it took about five guys to get
her off the poor fellow at Rockland.
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?
No.
No.
No.
Would you open
the door, please?
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?
- Yeah.
- I'm okay.
Hello.
Elisabeth, my name is Dr. Conrad.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Word has it that you haven't eaten for days.
Well, I can understand that.
I used to work in this hospital.
I know what the food's like.
Elisabeth, would you mind
if I took your pulse?
That means I'm gonna have to touch you.
Now that's not supposed to happen.
True catatonics have what's called
a waxy flexibility of their limbs.
That means they stay
exactly where they're posed.
There's more to you
than meets the eye, Elisabeth.
You're very, very good
at what you do.
So is there anything
you want to talk about?
Well, that's okay.
We hardly know each other.
I know you must have been very frightened
to do what you did to that guy.
I know that you were angry,
because I saw those photos.
But I also know
that you're in a lot of pain.
Because nobody's in this place
without a reason.
So maybe we'll talk
next week.
You want what they want.
Don't you?
What who wants?
Elisabeth,
what who wants?
Any of you.
Any of you.
Any of you.
H-Hello?
Who are you?
Five to three,
this old bag doesn't have cable.
I need my Sports Center.
Dinner's over!
How you doin', Tony?
- Good. How you doin'? Nice to see you again.
- You too.
Hello!
This certainly looks
like the Conrad residence.
It smells
like the Conrad residence.
And it is definitely
overheated...
like the Conrad residence.
But it doesn't sound
like the Conrad residence.
Hi, honey.
I'm looking for a little girl...
about four feet two, light brown hair.
Huh.
Where did she go?
Well, if I don't find
that little girl,
I'm gonna have to go downstairs
and find myself another little girl.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
- Hi!
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you?
- Look what I did in art class today.
That's beautiful. Look at the colors.
You got such a unique vision.
It's my vision,I swear.
Aren't you supposed
to be in bed?
I can't sleep.
I have mental problems.
- I see. What kind of mental problems?
- I'm highly neurotic.
- You've been in my study again.
- I needed the stapler.
Go say good night to Mom.
- You're late.
- Night, Mommy.
- Night, baby.
- Did you brush your teeth? Can I smell?
- Yeah.
Mmm, delicious.
I'm gonna put monkey
by you on that side,
and I'll put Sally over here
to keep you company.
- You had a bad day.
- Why do you say that?
Frown face!
If I had a frown face, it's because it's
after 10:00 and you're still awake.
Where were you tonight?
I was working.
Why?
Because I was helping
a young girl.
All right, but
that's gonna cost ya.
All right,
what's it gonna be?
One hug... two kisses.
Two kisses? Boy, you cut
a tough deal. Okay.
Here's one hug.
Mmmmm.
And one kiss.
And two kisses.
Will they put Bart Simpson
in the parade tomorrow?
They will put Bart Simpson in the
parade if you go to sleep right now.
Okay, but I don't think they'll
care if I go to sleep or not.
Good night, sweetheart.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Let me give you a hand, Detective.
- Thanks.
That's beautiful.
What exactly is beautiful?
- Your jacket, the leather jacket. It's beautiful.
- Right.
- Did you read about the Manhattan Bridge?
- No.
Actually, it was built wrong, moves ten feet.
But it's still standing.
- Syd Simon.
- I'll see you later.
Detective Cassidy.
What can I do for you?
What have we got?
Floater, female,
no I.D.
She's maybe in her 20s.
The sloughing of her skin tells me she's
been in the water maybe two, three days.
This time of year with
the water cold? Could be longer.
Couple, three days tops.
Her hands have been tied.
They recover any rope or anything?
They're still looking.
Another body was found,
a couple days ago.
- Battery Park area.
- Yeah.
Victim was male, middle-aged.
Day before yesterday.
All right. I'm gonna need
preliminary findings by tonight.
Dream on, Detective.
I got six, seven cases piled up.
Syd, I got important doings planned for
Thanks giving. Do me right, all right?
- Tomorrow's the best I can do.
- Thank you.
First thing though.
Cars have been towed, the roads plowed,
so the annual Turkey Trot--
You can't be distracted.
Here you are.
Immobile,
totally exposed...
and quite vulnerable.
I think you need a bath.
- Guess what, sweetie?
- What?
- I already had a bath.
- You did? Ah, well, you didn't have...
the Nathan Conrad fantastic
special bath, did you?
- No.
- No, you didn't do that.
I didn't get that one yet.
- Pretty hot? Not too hot, is it?
- No, it's nice.
Oh, good.
-I didn't know a thing
about my legacy-
- When I feel like
you were there for me--
We should keep it down.
You're the one that makes the noise.
Prepare to die
of delight!
Jessie, come on.
Let's join the downhill racer.
I heard that about
the "downhill racer."
You were dreaming.
I didn't say anything.
- It was icy, you know?
- I know it was, baby.
- And very windy too.
- It was a hell ride. Good morning.
Morning. You think
she's still sleeping?
I don't know.
Jessie?
Jessie, come on.
The parade's gonna start soon.
All right, I'm gonna go there
all by myself.
See all those foats alone.
Jessie, come on.
Breakfast is getting cold.
Does she have a new hiding place
that I don't know about?
Probably. She's been running around
the house like a wildcat all week.
Jessie, get in here right now!
Honey, eat it up
before it gets cold.
Nathan, she wouldn't go out
on the balcony, right?
She's not there.
She knows better than to go outside
without asking us, doesn't she?
Jessie, get in here right now!
You get outta here and go home
and enjoy your Thanks giving.
She lost one of her socks.
- What?
- She's gone.
What do you mean, "She's gone?"
Wait--
What do you mean, "She's gone?"
Wait--
- Somebody came in.
- No, no. She's in the hallway.
- Somebody took her.
- Nobody took her, Nathan.
- They broke in. They cut the chain on the door.
- What?
Call the police!
I can't get a dial tone.
Get off the line.
This is an emergency.
There's something wrong
with the goddamn phone.
- There is nothing wrong with the phone, Nathan.
- Get off, this is an emergency.
I know.
- Who is this?
- We have your daughter.
- What--
- Who is it?
- What's your worst fear, Nathan?
- What are they saying?
- The first shock can buckle the knees.
Any truth in that? - Where is she?
- She's unharmed.
- Give it to me!
I don't want to have to hurt her.
I want something from you.
- No.
- What?
Not until...
I talk to my daughter,
and I know she's okay.
Rule number one: You do not make demands.
You listen to what I tell you.
You call me back when
I can talk to my daughter.
- What are you doing?
- Aggie.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Listen to me.
- No! Are you crazy?
- Listen to me!
- No! No! - Aggie, we have to make
sure she's all right.
What if they don't call back?
Hello?
- Daddy?
- Jessie, are you okay, sweetie?
Honey, have they hurt you?
No. Daddy, can I
come home now? Daddy!
Jessie!
That was very brave, Nathan.
- Tell me how much money you want!
- I don't want your money.
Pick up your wife
before she breaks the other leg.
What?
Nathan, what is it?
Don't close the curtains.
I like the view.
Good. Now.
On the bureau by the door is a cell phone.
I know what you're thinking. Don't.
By the time you hit the "1"
in 911, Jessie will be dead.
Rule number two.:
Do not try to call or signal anyone.
If you do, I will kill your daughter.
Not because I want to,
but because those are the rules,
do you understand?
- Yes.
- What?
I can see you.
I can hear you.
When you leave your building, wherever
you go, you will be watched.
So if you want to see your daughter
alive, don't say a word.
- Now, tell me you understand.
- I understand.
Good. You have
a probono patient.
Her name is Elisabeth Burrows.
A very disturbed girl.
She has a six-digit number in her head,
locked away in her troubled mind.
She guards it with her life.
- What kind of number?
- That needn't concern you right now.
I need that number. You need your daughter
back. That is why this is happening.
You're a professional, Nathan, so am I.
If we both do our jobs
to the best of our abilities,
by this time tomorrow, it will be like...
we never even knew each other.
Now, go back to Bridgeview.
Take the Rover.
No police, no detours.
And, Nathan,
Aggie will be fine.
Rule number three.:
You have until 5:00 p.m. today.
Let's do exactly what he says.
- Nathan, why don't we just call the police?
- Because we can't.
- Nathan!
- Because I believe him.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Asshole.
Hey, Dr. Conrad, aren't you
and Jessie hitting the parade?
She's got a cold.
No signs of sexual assault.
I see evidence of injury in her neck.
Signs of bleeding in the strap muscles
overlying her larynx.
I don't know, Syd. This girl does not
match any of my missing persons.
Also evidence of a fracture
on the left tip of her hyoid bone.
- Syd, how'd she die?
- No blunt instrument here.
- Her neck was snapped in two.
- By what?
By two hands.
- By two hands.
Syd, the same technique used
on this Battery Park foater?
Same dislocation
of the skull.
- And the splotches on the body?
- Cigarette burns.
He was tortured.
Thank you.
And he had prison tats.
Okay.
I'm gonna need fingerprints and dental
X rays on our Jane Doe, pronto.
You know, this is Thanks giving.
You're right.
You are right.
All right, well, I hope her family isn't
waiting on her to carve the turkey.
Cassidy, I'm not susceptible
to your "guilting me" bullshit.
She probably helped her mom
with the dishes.
Fingerprints and dentals.
- Then I'm the hell outta here.
- Thank you, Syd.
Whoa!
Come on!
Roll down your window, sir.
- Officer, I'm a doctor.
- Congratulations.
You happen to notice the tuba player
that rolled off your hood?
I need to get through
this parade.
I need an escort to the Bridgeview
Psychiatric Hospital right now.
Do I look like a freaking helicopter?
Use 57th Street.
He's talking to the cops.
- What'll we do?
- Be patient.
There's a young girl who
could die, so, Officer Kreidman,
you can either help me
save this girl... or not.
I need two guys.
The two of you. Let's go.
Right over there.
Come on, come on.
Hold the band.
Hold the band right there.
Open those gates for me, guys.
Son of a bitch.
He just picked up a police escort
and cut through the parade.
- I like that.
- What?
The police escort.
I like it a lot.
- You didn't tell me the context of the number.
- She knows.
Look, this girl has
a decade of pathology to unravel.
Even if she knows,
your 5:00 deadline is absurd.
In my experience, people are at their
best when facing unreasonable deadlines.
You can't just flick
a switch in the girl's head.
You have to trust me. It does
not work that way in these cases.
Look, the money's bad, I know.
But you have family obligations.
And, Nathan,
don't lose the phone.
- The doctor has landed.
- Did he double alarm the car?
- Nope.
- Good. We've got him focused.
- Do you have the key to Dr. Sachs's office?
- Yeah.
- Could you open it, please? Open it.
- But Dr. Sachs isn't here.
I thought Nathan
explained the rules very clearly.
Put the cell phone back.
There's no percentage
in breaking those rules.
You sick son of a bitch!
You hurt my little girl and I'll--
You'll do what?
You were about
to say something personal.
I think.
- No.
- That's good.
If your husband is on his game today,
you've got nothing to worry about.
There's a good side to this, Aggie.
This will bring you...
much closer
than the occasional ski trip...
or sponge bath.
The remote is to your left.
Pick it up.
Pick it up!
Good.
Now turn it on.
North Carolinas tops--
Try HBO.
No, I've seen this.
Bit too violent.
Try a nice family drama.
Nathan!
- What are you doing here? -
You're not supposed to be here.
How'd you get in?
Who let you in?
You're supposed to be in
Greenwich with Kim and her family.
Why are you here
on Thanks giving?
Why am I here? I gotta
testify in a double homicide...
on Monday, and I thought
I'd come do research.
What?
You broke into my files!
Those are my per--
I would've given you the key, man.
Have you gone through all of this?
Well, not all of it.
I just got here.
I've been through the master file.
It's a swamp of misdiagnoses.
- I think she's overlaying.
- Overlaying?
Louis,
she is a brilliant mimic.
That's why Rockland couldn't
figure her out. She's highly adaptive.
She takes on the symptoms
of other patients.
She's like a counterfeit
schizophrenic, maybe.
Come on, I-- I can't believe
it's all smoke and mirrors.
That would place her
in the malingerer's hall of fame.
I gotta believe there's some sort
of genuine pathology beneath it all.
She has classic post-traumatic stress symptoms.
Her P.T.S.D. is real.
Seeing her father die.
That was ground zero.
She also believes that something
or somebody is after her.
And that is why she stayed
institutionalized these past ten years.
She wants to stay inside.
So 20 different
hospitalizations,
twenty different diagnoses.
All overlaying.
Nathan, that would make her
a very,
very talented young lady,
wouldn't it?
Or desperate.
- Louis?
- Yeah?
Does anybody know I'm treating
Elisabeth Burrows besides you?
Everybody. I put it up last night after
you left. Figured you might be back.
I wanted you to have clearance in case I
wasn't around. Also reinstated your password.
Gate, please!
- Elisabeth, good morning.
- Feeling better?
I brought you something.
A chocolate turkey.
The sugar will help you metabolize all
those meds they've been giving you.
You like Thanks giving?
It's my favorite holiday.
Wanna touch?
Sorry?
I saw you looking.
I know what you're trying to do.
You want to embarrass me.
It won't work.
The other doctor?
- Dr. Sachs.
- Yeah.
I don't like him.
Well, I can understand that.
Very fucking funny.
Elisabeth, there's something
important I have to ask you.
But first
I want to show you something.
I have a daughter.
She's eight... going on eighteen.
Her name's Jessie.
I have some of
her favorite things here.
This is Horton Hearsa Who.
I've read it to her so many times,
it's pretty worn by now.
And this. She loves to draw
weird pictures of me.
And this--
This is Sally.
Would you like one of those?
I'll make sure the hospital
lets you keep it.
- But you can only choose one.
- What the hell is this, Toys "R" Us?
Want me to choose for you?
Choose 'fore you lose. For you choose
'fore you lose for you--
- Dr. Conrad?
- Yes?
Get out.
No.
I want you to leave.
- We're not finished talking, Elisabeth.
- I know what you're trying to do.
You wanna embarrass me.
It won't work.
What's your name?
Your hair's really long.
My hair used to be that long,
but my mom made me cut it.
What's that thing
on your neck?
It's kind of impolite not
to answer someone's question.
It's a symbol.
What's it mean?
No talk.
Elisabeth, there's something
I need to know.
Jessie.
Jessie?
That's my little girl's name.
You wanna see a picture
that Jessie drew?
I'll make you a deal.
I'll show you the picture
if you answer my question.
Is it worth just one answer?
I don't mean a "yes" and "no" answer.
Maybe.
I'm gonna ask my question now.
Is the man that you hurt
at Rockland--
Did that have anything to do
with the terrible thing...
that happened to you
in the subway years ago?
Run, honey, run! Shit!
Run, honey, run!
- I didn't know what you
were talking about yesterday.
- Run! - I didn't know who
they were or what they wanted.
- Leave!
- Now I do.I know how bad they wanted it.
- I know how important it was for you to
hold onto it. - Leave! Leave! Leave!
- Leave! Leave! Leave!
- Elisabeth--
Get out!
Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave!
Go!
Thank you. I'm sorry.
You lost her.
She's still got the doll,
doesn't she?
- Yeah?
- That went well.
Look, I can gain her trust,
but without more information...
- I'm shooting in the dark.
- The answer's right in front of you.
I have gone through her files!
All right?
Then look closer.
- You--
- Nathan,
- it's 12:22.
I'm sure of one thing.
They would have encountered
quite a few venomous species.
Check this out.
See how he's got his tail up?
He is grumpy.
He gets his stinger back over
the top of his head, ready to grab.
Whack! Sting!
Signora Conrad?
Sofia.
Sofia, why are you here?
Si,laporta.
I broke it. Mr. Conrad will fix it.
- What? What?
- IL tacchino.
- No, no, no. No tacchino.
No telefono! No!
Just give it to me.
- Excuse me. Dammelo. Grazie.
Hello.
Signora?
Get rid of her.
Sofia, uh, no tacchino.
Oh. Si.
Grazie. Arrivederci.
- Any more visitors?
- No.
Oh, come on, yeah.
Come on, baby, take it off. Come on.
All right, suit yourself.
I have to go.
You have to call me back.
You seen this?
What's this? "Girl found
wandering on Hart Island."
- Where'd you find this?
- In her file in your office.
"A young girl was found yesterday
among the coffins on Hart Island."
This is around the time
that her father died.
I should run this by Child Services.
Could she have been lost or unattended?
- What-- That's very bizarre.
- On an island in the East River.
I saw Sara two days ago.
She was meeting her boyfriend in the Village.
Maybe she's still with him.
She could be.
Wait one second.
- Hey,Jake. Uh, tray 57,and just her face.Thanks.
- Yeah, okay.
- Come on.
- It stinks in here. It smells weird.
I know. Just beat he
through your mouth.
- I've never seen anyone dead before.
- You'll do fine, okay?
- I'm gonna get sick.
- Listen, no one in here is gonna mind. Okay?
Come on.
- Uh, listen, I've gotta take this.
But I'm gonna be
right here. Okay?
Cassidy.
Oh. Hey, baby. Yeah.
Uh, no. You should take
the 1:00 because I--
I'll beat Penn Station by 2:00.
- Make it 7:00.
- I promise.
- Don't promise.
What? Yeah,
I'm almost done here.
Yeah. I'm at the city morgue.
- Bye.
- Mmm.
That's your N.C.I.C.
on the guy with the busted neck.
Oh, I got a hit.
Leon Edwards Croft.
Jesus, what does he have,15,20 arrests?
Well, he's a busy little bad guy.
Won't be missed.
- You run him for known associates?
- Of course.
Am I not a paid professional?
- It's okay
Why would someone do this to Sara?
The guy with the cigarette burns,
Croft, he was the driver for this crew.
Robbery said they hit banks
here,Jersey, Delaware, Virginia.
No convictions till '91 .
And, three of his friends just
capped off a ten-year  jolt in Attica.
Patrick Barry Koster.
He's the last one that got out.
November 4.
On November 4!
Did Croft
rat these guys out?
I don't know.
Could be payback.
He has no priors. There is nothing on him.
He came out of nowhere. There's nothing.
It's the only thing he ever
got popped for. Guy's a ghost.
He's a ghost?
Well, I guess that's who I need
to talk to, then. Thank you.
- Watch your back.
- Yeah.
Well, you picked Jessie's
absolutely favorite thing.
She and Sally were inseparable
since they were two.
Where is she?
Where's Jessie?
They took her.
Now she's really scared.
As scared as you were when you went after that
guy at Rockland, but she's only eight years old.
She's not as strong as you are.
She can't protect herself
as well as you can.
See, I am not just here
to help you.
- I need you to help me.
Otherwise I'm not gettin'
my little girl back.
Today's Thanks giving.
You remember Thanks giving?
Yes. Yes, I remember.
Who were you with?
My dad.
Just me and my dad.
Being strong isn't only
about protecting yourself,
it's also having the strength to let go,
especially if you're holding on to something--
holding on so tightly that you don't even
know that you could have a better life.
The only way that you
can help yourself...
is if you go back.
You have to go back
to that day on the subway.
I can't-- can't do it.
No, I can't.
Here we go. The main event.
You can't help my little girl
unless you go back.
No, please.
Listen to me.
The men that have Jessie...
are the same men
that you're fighting.
- They are the men that sent the orderly at
Rockland after you.- I don't want to hear this.
All they want is a number.
- You want what they want.
- They know that you know the number.
- They're gonna kill my little
girl if you don't tell me. - Stop it.
Daddy!
- Is it a telephone number?
- No.
- An address? An account?
- I don't know.
It's a bank account.
Is it a code?
- No.
- Is it a place? What is it?
What--
- What's wrong? We lost the feed?
- No, no, we're good!
You leave him alone.
Your father is gone.
He is gone, and no one
is gonna hurt him anymore.
My little girl
is still alive.
Jessie is alive.
Dr. Conrad?
I'm scared.
I know.
I'm sorry.
- Shit.
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Elisabeth.
- I'll try.
You're okay.
Long time since breakfast,
huh?
- Yeah.
- I wish we had some cheeseburgers.
- Whisper I love you-
- Birds singing in -
Best turkey you ever had. Be careful.
I'll put you in the oven with it.
- I love you, Daddy.
- Smile, sweet cheeks.
- What's that?
- This is a 5cc syringe...
with a ten-gauge needle and 500
milligrams of sodium Amytal.
What are you talking about,
500 milligrams?
Why don't you shove a quart of Jack Daniels
down her throat or stick a shotgun in her mouth?
Look. The event is obviously
right beneath the surface.
- She should respond beautifully
to Amytal, so I'm--
Answer it.
You answer the phone.
Now, you tell them
everything's okay...
and that you're going
to plan "B."
Everything's okay,
and we're going to plan "B."
It's a drug.
You knew all about the numbers,
and you set me up, Louis.
- I swear to God--
- You tell me why,
- or I'll shove this - He's got my fucking
girlfriend! He's keeping Sara hostage!
He's gonna kill her
if I don't get this number.
- Your girlfriend, Louis?
- Yeah.
- Well, he's got my daughter.
- He's got my little girl.
- Nathan, I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
You gotta get this number
for this guy. He'll just go away.
- It's that simple.
- It's that simple.
Dr. Sachs? Dr. Sachs?
- Yes?
- There's a cop here to see you.
- Cop? What kind of cop?
- I don't know.
- What's he want?
- She.
She didn't say, but she's
waiting in your office.
Okay.
Tell her
I'll be right there.
Okay.
He said no cops!
He told me absolutely no cops.
Here's what you've gotta do.You have got
to go down to your office.
- You have to be cool.
- But what--
And you make her
go away.
If we don't have  it
by 4:30, we go to plan "B."
What is this?
Peanut butter and jelly.
What kind of jelly is it?
Hello there.
- I'm Louis Sachs.
- Hi. Detective Cassidy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Pretty girl.
Is that your daughter?
This? No. This is not my daughter.
How can I help you today, Detective?
- I'm here about this woman.
- What about her?
- You don't know her?
- Nope.
She worked in the hospital for five months.
She was a resident there.
Really? Well, we have dozens and dozens
of residents. I will tell you that.
She worked in the department
you oversee, Dr. Sachs.
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, that's strange, because in that case
I should know who she is, and I don't.
- So there's gotta be a mistake.
- When did you last see Sara?
Detective, I just told you,
and I'll tell you again,
I do not know who that is.
Where are we going?
Do you have a lawyer, sir?
- What?
- Do you have a lawyer?
- What are you talking--
- You don't know Sara, right?
No, I don't know Sara. But what are
we talking about lawyers for?
A week ago,
in Central Park, with you.
She told her roommate Vanessa all about it.
You know Vanessa, don't you? She knows you.
- I don't know Vanessa either.
- Dr. Sachs.
- I'm about to read you your rights.
- My rights?
- But first--
- What did I do?
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Okay.
This is last weekend, with you,
by the fountain in Central Park.
You took this picture,
and this is her now.
This one you did. This one I took.
Who do you think did better, me or you?
- That's not Sara. - That's Sara all right.
That's Sara, laid out in the morgue.
- No, it's not--
- I work Homicide,Dr. Sachs. That's Sara.
The morgue?
That's a mistake. It can't be
Sara. That's not the deal.
- That's not the deal?
- That's not the deal.
Okay. Why don't you tell me
what the fuck the deal is?
Who is part of the deal?
Is he part of the deal?
How about him? Or him?
Or him?
How about him? Or him?
Or him?
Tell me who is part of the deal!
Why don't you tell me?
- He said we had until 5:00 today!
- Who's "we"?
- So that's a mistake!
- That is not a mistake. Who's "we"?
And we are so fucking close
and all we need is another half hour--
Dr. Sachs, who is we?
- That's not Sara!
Why don't you quit wasting my fucking
time and tell me who's we?
Hey.
You like country music?
Hey.
You like country music?
Mm-hmm.
Low pressure over in Virginia, and that
is getting stronger by the minute.
- Pink toenails Got my--
-All my girlfriends have time
for their pink toenails -
- Baby doll when you find me
sitting there in my pink--
What did I say about noise?
Daddy's smart little girl,
aren't you?
Better hope your mother
didn't hear that.
Go full screen on her.
Tighter.
- She heard.
- How do you know?
She stopped breathing.
What can I do for you,
Doc?
Arnie, I need to ask you a favor.
Are you taking Burrows for a stroll?
We're out of here. Bring her!
Mommy, Daddy, I'm up here!
Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Let me outta here!
Take care of her.
I need you to open
the gates.
On whose authorization?
This is between you and me.
See, that's why they call
this place the nuthouse, Doc.
Cause I'd have to be basically
fuckin' nuts to let you do that.
Okay. Well, you know,
I just had to ask you.
It's okay, Arnie.
It's just Versed.
It's okay. It's all right.
You'll be all right in about an hour.
Dr. Conrad?
Dr. Conrad!
Doctor--
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Emergency procedures.
Officer down.
We have a security breach.
Institute emergency procedures.
Seal off main entrance.
Sorry.
Come on.
Check out the radar close in.
Here's Hartford.
Thirty degrees.
- Primarily, it is--
- No!
Central, be advised, a gold Land Rover
just left Bridgeview, headed east.
- Okay. Leaving.
- The driver is Nathan Conrad,
wanted for questioning
in connection with a homicide.
- Have an R.M.P. respond
to his residence immediately.
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
- What's on your mind, Nathan?
- Field trip.
- Wait a second.
Where are you
taking Jessie?
- Why are you moving her?
- You've got 44 minutes.
Why are you moving her?
I will get you the number.
Just don't hurt her.
Forty-three minutes.
You have reached New York City's
emergency services.
Please stay on the line. Your call will
be answered in the order it was received.
You crippled bitch!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
No!
This is where it happened,
isn't it, Elisabeth?
No.
When we left home,
my dad and me--
I think we--
A big car, dark.
I'd never seen my dad
so scared.
He grabbed my arm. He kept
running and running and running.
And I tried to keep up.
I tried to keep up.
He took--
- Ah, you can do it.
- Okay.
You can do it.
Let's go.
I tried to keep up.
It's okay.
Elisabeth.
There were lots of people,
but my dad just
pulled me through them.
I looked back.
They were so fast.
They're still behind us.
Now only women.
We lost one.
My dad took me
around the corner.
He made me hide over here.
Okay, listen to me carefully.
You and Mishka have gotta wait right here.
Right here, no matter what.
It's gonna be all right.
Wait right here.
Hey, Russel!
Where you been?
What's in the bag?
What's in the fucking bag?
I could see my dad's face
when he tried to talk to them.
The bag.
There's nothing
in the fucking bag!
Where is it?
Where is it, Russel?
What's happening now?
Where is it?
Elisabeth?
- I don't believe a fucking word!
Elisabeth, what do you see?
[Koster]
Where is it?
The one in the red coat kept on
kicking him and kicking him.
They're asking him, "Where is it?
Where is it? Tell me where it is!"
Let me up!
I'll tell you where it is!
Elisabeth.
Jesus. Help me up.
Everybody was watching. They were just
watching, and no one would help.
No one would help.
No one.
Everybody was watching,
and no one would help!
Elisabeth,what did the man want?
- What did he want?
- I can almost reach him.
Elisabeth!
Daddy!
No! Daddy!
Turn around!
Hands up!
Down on your knees!
Now!
What did the man want,
Elisabeth?
Did he want a number?
Elisabeth, I need to know
what the man wanted.
He wants Mishka.
My doll.
- Where is Mishka?
- Hang on to that. Okay, baby?
- Yeah.
- Cutting it rather close.
All right.
I have what you want.
Good.
I'm listening.
I've decided--
- I've decided I'm gonna deliver the
number to you in person. - No time.
- No choice.
- You're being brave again, Nathan.
That's the best way
to get your daughter killed.
Other than missing the deadline,
which is less than three minutes away.
Rule number one:
No more clock.
- What?
- You heard me.
- I'll meet you there.
- Where?
I think that you know where. Rule number two:
I want to speak to my daughter now.
Do you hear me? I want
to speak to my daughter now!
- Daddy?
- Pumpkin, you all right?
Yeah. Daddy,
please come get me now.
I'm on my way,
sweetheart.
- Anything else?
- Rule number three:
No more phone.
Buddy! I've got a medical emergency.
I'll get this back to you.
- I'll get it back to you.
- Aggie?
- Is she alive?
- She's fine.
- Where is she?
Aggie, listen tome--
What is that?
Did you call the police?
Aggie? Aggie?
No. But somebody did.
Do they know
what's going on?
Not yet.
- Listen.
- I'm here.
Just get her back.
Hey, fella!
What are you doin' down there?
That's my boat.
Where you goin'? Hey!
- Hey, asshole!
- That's my boat!
Dr. Conrad.
You're a committed man.
I wanna see her.
I want to see her now.
Grim place
for a holiday, isn't it?
Hello, Elisabeth.
I thought about you every day for the last
ten years. Bet you thought about me too.
I know you've been through a lot.
So have I.
Your father
let us both down.
- Where's my daughter? - You brought her
here because she hasn't given it to you.
- Where are you keeping her?
- She won't give it to you.
- I want to see Jessie now.
- Where is my number?
You're not getting anything
until I see--
We talked about
bravery today.
It's not good.
You need to know how
to use these.
I wanna see my daughter.
I think you've earned it.
- Max!
- Daddy?
Jessie?
- Daddy!
- Jessie! It's all right, honey.
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be all right.
You guessed the number
is a grave. Very good.
Now what?
I finish my job.
Come on, Nathan.
Up the stairs.
Over there,
by the table.
And Elisabeth.
Not her.
Take her back outside.
- Daddy?
- Jessie.
You're gonna be
all right, honey.
You're gonna be all right.
Now. Let's see what
200 an hour can do.
Officer Peterson, nice work.
You found my car. Where is it?
It's over there.
- Okay. Where's my guy?
- Well...
he smashed through a steel fence
on the corrections pier,
then he jacked a boat
from that individual.
- A boat?
- Yeah. He and some girl.
- Sounds a little hinky, huh?
- A boat to where?
- That's the Coast Guard's problem.
- It is not.
It is my problem. It is your problem.
What is over there?
- Where's the music
coming from, Elisabeth?
- The radio.
- The radio?
- Where?
- It's playing on the boat.
On the boat that brought you
here the first time?
Yeah.
It was cold.
I was wet.
- My eyes were burning.
But I was with my dad.
How did you know
which one was your dad?
They gave him a number.
Where was this number?
It was on his box.
They carved the number
on top of his box.
I tried to get it open,
but my fingers were numb.
And I couldn't lift it.
It was too heavy.
I couldn't put Mishka
inside.
You better pray
she's lying, Nathan.
Where did Mishka go?
What happened to Mishka?
They saw--
They saw me.
- Who saw you?
- The men.
The men with the music.
They were working.
They said my lips were blue.
And they gave me a blanket.
I told them my dad's inside,
and I need to put her inside
with him.
I needed to put Mishka in the box.
I told them.
What did they do?
They helped me.
They--
They...
helped me put Mishka...
inside the box with him.
They let me stay with him...
until--
until--
Until--
Until--
So what do you think is gonna
happen when you dig this up?
He's gonna have you kill me
and my little girl.
You like her.
I can tell that.
When you're done with us,
he'll be done with you.
Just
keep walking.
This boat's for charter, not runnin'
around the goddamn Sound on Thanks giving.
Like I said, sir,
it's police business.
Now do me a favor, Captain Bligh.
Just drive the friggin' boat.
Go on, Max.
Open it up.
Get her out!
The girl, out!
The girl, out!
Sit down. Sit down!
Daddy! Let me go!
I am going to put
a bullet through your knee.
Then you'll give me
the right number.
No!
No! Get off!
Get her off!
Sit down!
I'll kill you! Forget the fucking number.
Just say hi to your dad from me.
- She gave it to you!
- She gave me nothing.
- She reversed it!
- She gave me nothing! Shut up!
- She reversed the image in her mind!
- You lying bitch!
Cognitive distortion.
She wrote it right to left.
Look. Look.
She sees it in a mirror.
Can you imagine what will
happen if this is bullshit?
Central, this is Detective Cassidy
from Manhattan South Homicide.
Shots fired on the northeast
shore of Hart Island.
I'm en route and I need
harbor and aviation.
Ten years of my life...
bought and fucking paid for.
Take care of that.
Whoa, whoa.
I'll kill you!
Oh!
Agh!
You're not like me,
Nathan.
I would have killed the man
who took my little girl.
Police! Don't move!
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!
Go on.
I never got your name.
Patrick.
Patrick.
Are you sure...
I'm not like you?
- Are you sure?
Was this really worth it?
What?
Your life.
Absolutely.
It's mine.
Then, you go get it.
Get it!
I'll be right back,
sweetie.
- How you holdin' up?
- I've been better.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Come on.
