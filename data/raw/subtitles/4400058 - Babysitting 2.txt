- To leave me alone.
- Thank You.
- Perfect.
Frank, have you seen
the Brazilian spider?
The most dangerous in the world.
Bites you, you're hot, you're cold.
And if that doesn't cure you
within 12 hours, you die.
- Crazy, right?
- Yeah, crazy.
- I don't Care?
- A Little.
- Baby...
- What happened?
- Don't watch porn on the plane.
- I don't care, everyone's asleep.
He's not.
I don't understand without sound.
Sure.
Sam, Alex, let me
tell you something.
Don't move!
- Ernest, it's ok for the cockpit?
- So, I asked for the cockpit.
It's a little complicated.
They said no.
- What did you want to show us?
- View here, guys.
It rocks!
- A Girl!
- You Idiot, Sonya.
- He's Gonna propose!
- Damn It! Congratulations!
Shut Up! What? I don't know?
No, you have to spend, and

Slowly, it's a shock.
It's coming! Put that away!
Guys, what are you

He's freaking out that's
going to meet your father.

This is my first album.
The collector's edition.
Do you know how many trees of the
Amazon should be cut for such a paper?
- No.
- A Lot.
Do you know how many Indians have left
due to the deforestation of forests?
- Nor.
- Not a lot.
Dad, please.
Let me show you the
earthly, my paradise!
- Ok? What did you think?
- Is likeable.
Nice.
You'll get to meet my grandmother.
Very nice, too.
I can't wait...
Your mom said that a long time
ago, I'm only in the registry?
I Will be in charge of the crew.
- Perfect.
Thank you very much for the
hospitality in your hotel.
My daughter insisted I call you.
- I could take a dip in the pool.
- This is Not a swimming pool, my child.
Is the pond for the
centenarians turtles.
- Terrible! The turtles have wi-fi!
- I don't have wi-fi.
Have a GPS to locate them
and study their movements.
What was I saying? Here we have
neither a swimming pool nor a tv.
Our waste is recycled.
Our customers are
nature lovers, like me.
Our motto here is nature,
nature and again nature!
Damn it!
Can I help you?
- I called? Stick it up your ass!
- Jurassic Park!
- My mom is.
Grandma!
- Sonia!
- Here I am!
- Sunshine!
- How nice to see you!
Hi, grandma!
- Here's the jerk?
- Here it is.
- Who is he?
- Frank.
- What do you do?
- Catch diarrhoea.
I had gastroenteritis.
Mr Μασιέ, how are you?
Is everything all right?
The director of the WWF. It will
give the eco name of the hotel.
- Tomorrow is the ceremony.
- What brand is that?
Our clients are assured that
we are in harmony with nature.
- And, above double the prices!
- Mom, please! Don't start!
Michel, is everything all right?
Hi, Jean-Pierre.
Mrs. Μασιέ, how was the shower
with the seaweed? A beauty!
Perfect!
Jean-Pierre, the hotel
you deserve the name.
- Thank You.
- My wife loves it.
This is my daughter
Sonia and her friends.
And the mom that lives here
with me, the Γιολάvτ Lamar.
I'll leave you with the family...
see you tomorrow at the ceremony.
Thank you! Have a nice day!
- What were you doing in my suitcase?
- Don't worry, it's nothing.
Mom, don't stand upright.
For sitting you got it.
I don't need a walker
for grandmothers.
Go two miles an hour and
stays out of battery.
I'll change it.
He dropped mom!
I'm sorry! Excuse me!
I'm sorry... Are you okay?
How do you do? Okay?
- I don't have anything.
- Take a deep breath!
- Don't come near him!
- I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry.
- A Catch you got!
- I'm Sorry.
Come on, mom.
Fortunately, your grandmother
is a tough old dog.
Uncle, why did you choose
for a mascot that bird?
Is the κυαvόραμφο toucan.
Bird sanctuary. Unfortunately,
it was destroyed years ago.
But it remains our symbol for
the protection of animals.
We grow what we eat. Here
everything is organic.
Organic products, recycling...
good for business, huh?
It's not business,
it's a way of life.
The customers come in contact with
the nature. And I that's why I came.
Then will that man filming us?
Has started to get on my...
Guys, you want to have fun. I
have what you need for that.
See the canoes from
recycled plastic.
Take it and have fun.
I'd love to, but I need to bring
my fiancee from the airport.
- I'm not in the mood for canoeing.
- Impossible!
Do I look like I am not
the type for a canoe?
A Very bad hotel. Oh, Shit.
- Did you get my ring?
- I can't, when I'm not home.
Sam, where are you taking us?
My friends... the real
vacation starts now!
What is this?
Asshole! What a waste of life!
- What are these?
- Plums.
Why? Shut up and eat!
- To do bad?
- Yeah!
Damn it!
Incredible!
My heart, pierced all of my
clothes with his harpoon.
Look! Come see! All leaky!
- You find that funny?
- I don't care at all now.
Good evening...
my name is Frank.
Come On, Τζεζόv! Get a move on!
Guys, going out for a beer.
Anyone want one?
- No, thank you.
- Ok.
Did you get it?
Don't worry about it. In Brazil, a man
with a bra does not come as a shock.
- Go right?
- What's going on?
- What's the matter, sweetheart?
- I threw the ball and laughing.
Why don't you demand an apology? I'll
give it to you, but play further.
Mocking Us.
- Throw it away! The bastards!
I'm sorry.
- Are You okay? Where did I hit you?
- Here.
I'm sorry. Are you in pain?
You threw the ball to the cacti.
You, Goldie.
We don't want any trouble on vacation.
- Go get the ball.
It's going well? Learn
ways to your children.
And I'm not talking to the slut.
- Ho I?
- Do you See anyone else here?
Frank, do something.
- Okay, I'm going to get the ball.
- No, this one he called me a slut!
- Don't pay attention. He has a temper.
- He has nerves?
- Let it go.
I can count on you.
- Is There a problem?
- This one called me a slut.
- You Said my daughter a slut?
- I didn't know that she is your daughter.
I got mad a little bit. He threw the
ball to my children of the cacti.
You threw the ball of the children?
Go and get it.
And act like a man. I
won't be here next time.
Thank you, sir.
Come on.
What to do with it?
It is deflated.
If you wake me up, I'll knock him out.
Wait, to get postcards.
Sonia knows that I don't play
wood and now he's sulking.
- Make a proposal of marriage.
- I Need the ring.
Call flowers.
- I'm Sorry, did I hurt you?
- No problem.
It's not my day.
- Julie.
- Erica.
Nice to meet you. Vacation?
Yes, a week of skydiving.
I don't know you! The creator
of the comic "Babysitting"!
- Crazy! I liked it a lot. Well done.
- Thank You.
- Do something together tomorrow?
- Of Course!
No, we can't tomorrow.
Well, we leave you... your
shirt has a hole in it.
A harpoon pierced the bag.
- What are these?
- Make a vacation. It's French.
The key to the room, please.
What were these?
I don't know, but I have
to see you again Erica.
Damn it! Passing tickets out
of my pussy with her hands!
So my finger, I'll break
it down to the wood!
I felt that I was humiliated on
the beach, a little while ago.
Got in the way and my father.
Don't look for it. Frankie
makes at times like a sister.
All men have a gay side.
Look at Alex.
He likes to wear my underwear.
Are you serious?
I hate that I'm in love
with such a cowardly man.
- And I have doubts.
- Seriously? What doubts?
I don't know if I want to live with
a man who would not protect me.
- Tough.
- If we have kids...
I don't see him as the
father of your children.
I don't know. On the beach,
I stopped to admire him.
Sonya... I want to fart.
Hang in there.
So I touch my pussy, I'll fart!
"Fair trade"!
My friend, I'll cheer you up.
Tomorrow we will go
on a field trip.
- I have no appetite.
- I Signed up for it.
- You want to go outing?
- Of Course.
We must not lose our cultural
heritage of the place.
- And the girls?
- Leave it to me.
This is crazy, you see.
I found a treasure map.
The placemats, idiot.
Greetings, gang!
Did You miss me?
Sam, there's an awkward
silence between us.
I don't hold it against you
for what you did with my ex.
You opened my eyes. Thanks to you, I
saw that he is a little frivolous.
And I wouldn't have met
my fiancée, Josephine.
- He Came In?
- Yes. Where is it?
There.
A very welcoming
country, Brazil, huh?
What's the program for tomorrow?
- We will go on a field trip.
Let's go to bed. We got
up early in the morning.
- Hello, Ernest.
- Hi.
Good night.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. Can
I borrow my fiancée?
- No.
- Okay, no problem.
Leave the talking to me.
There is.
- Girls, what will you do today?
- Beach.
We go on a field trip.
Are you coming?
Trip? Not in the
mood for granny.
No, thank you.
Guys, go to field trip?
Perfect! Mom will love it!
It's not for her age.
I love it, but to my watch.
Is touchy-feely.
- Do You Understand?
- Yes.
- Ernest, will not come Josephine?
- He Prefers the surf lessons.
- Baby, let's go on a field trip.
- I'll see you later, my love.
- Be careful.
- Don't worry, honey.
- Let's Go!
- We'll be back in a couple of hours.
Hello, girls!
Have fun, mom.
- Hi, Jean-Pierre.
- Hello, uncle.
You trust her, huh?
- How do you let go?
- I'll get an eco-label.
You know your grandmother.
I don't πολυβλέπουv.
It will be a joy with the lads.
And Frank.
I have to go. I have
a phone meeting.
Dad!
- Not found?
- No sign of them in the area.
We need to expand the research.
We'll come with you.
Get.
It no longer has light, he says, and
we need to stop the investigations.
To get. Passed 24 hours
since they left.
- And no new. I'm going to go crazy.
- No news, good news!
What an idiot! Incredible!
- Ask for an apology, you bastard!
- I'm Sorry.
- And we had a fight before they left.
- In your position, I would have felt bad.
All night, I was dreaming about Alex.
We were on our first date.
It was very romantic.
We went to an Italian restaurant,
we ate pasta, we faced each other.
- Like the "Lady and the Tramp".
- And then?
We went home and we fucked.
My love, I had a very important
phone call and I found this.
- The camera of your friend?
- Been taken. How did it get there?
- Is the hotel?
- João, check out of the hotel.
It Is important. It's my mom.
<-S -> Yes, mr. Lamar.
But what can be happened?
There's only One way to find out.
See the.
Here we go again...
It will work like that?
Anything yet?
What stress! The ceremony
starts in 15 minutes!
Dad, nobody gives a shit
about the ceremony.
Of course, that's what I say. Who
gives a shit about the ceremony.
The linked, Fernando?
Yes, the connection.
Doesn't show anything.
Plug it in, Fernando!
What is this?
Alex, what the hell are you doing?
One time you're in!
I'm Coming, baby!
- We'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Hello, girls!
- Hey, kids!
- Have fun, mom!
What our uploaded Jurassic Park?
And the other pretending
to be Indiana Jones!
Why didn't you say no?
- I don't have a choice.
Hurry, waiting for the bus.
<-S -> What bus?
Sam, what's a bus?
I don't do at your age.
You're breaking my barrs. I'm
old, but I have a right to live!
It relaxes me.
- Nigger, I came, huh?
- Not At All.
See It, nigger...
<- S->- a Little.
You're the complete opposite
from the former Sonia.
- Really?
- Yes.
- He was likeable, and android.
- Perfect.

Vacation in the Seychelles.
Handsome, huh?
Yes, it is.

- Lighten up, grandma.
Here we had gone to the concert
of the Snοοp Dοggy Bag.
- Tell me if you're bored.
- Not At All.
I have pictures and Jean-Pierre.
Look, a nude beach, teen.
- Small Cock!
- I Always had a little bird.
That year, the water
was very cold.
Ice.
- I'm gifted.
- Really? For you to see.
Sam, why are we here?
- Scratched.
- Where are we going?
- In the caves.
- A Mess of the plane.
- It's a B18. Recognize it.
Hello. My name is John.
CNN! Hi! Yes, exactly.
I am your guide and will
accompany you on your trip.
You are more than I expected.
Our load. Is that a problem?
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello, ma'am.
No, if you pay.
Hello, girls!
- Son Of A Bitch!
- A Coincidence... Amazing!
- Ready?
- Perfect for coming in.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Erica.
- The bastards!
- What are these sluts?
They look nice.
I didn't want to say this.
No, not at all sympathetic.
They look vulgar.
And very hackneyed.
- May be...
- that's Enough.
Are you kidding me? What do
we do with them? I'm not going.
I wouldn't miss such an opportunity.
Playing something with Erica.
- As always.
- We're kindred souls.
Is There a problem? No, you
simply won't come to you.
- Γιολάvτ, let's go back.
- I Prefer to pay a visit to a cave.
Despite set to be bored stiff at the
hotel with the vερόβραστα foods.
- We can't with a wheelchair.
- The cave has paths.
- Here It Is!
- Perfect. Go?
- Let's Go!
- Perfect!
Let's go!
A population, don't get
any ideas with the plane!
I Will have to do with me!
<-S -> What thing?
Is she serious? Okay,
"Master Yoda"!
The altimeter is here in B18!
- I the profession I am.
- Pilot?
Almost. Caregiver...
But I can fly.
Really fly it, Ernest's?
Yeah, lame wrong. I have
over 100 hours of flight.
Ernest knows how to fly!
- Really?
- Good.
Are you afraid of?
- A Little.
- So sweet!
Idiot! Frank is afraid
of airplanes!!!
Who's afraid? Frank,
don't be afraid at all.
We have parachutes in the back!
Nice, that's a relief.
Relax, you're too uptight.
- Do a good massage.
- It's my job.
Masseuse are you?
You are very cute!
I'll get you a photo!
Come On, Frank.
Perfect! You guys are so cute together!
I'll post the Ιnstagram!
I would Not have it.
- Like Brad Pitt with Angelina.
In the cheap version!
- Till when can you stay?
- I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'm the muse of an Italian brand.
I have a photo shoot in Milan.
I don't have time to get
to know each other.
- Look like Carmen Electra.
- Thank You. For you to George Clooney.
- No.
- Of course not!
What I hate... The landing!
Perfect!
I don't go to the jungle, right?
No, it's too dangerous.
The cave is there.
He can't bear not in a zoo!
Let's go!
Easy, Γιολάvτ. Carefully.
It's hot. We will walk a lot?
That's it!
I changed my battery.
Shit! You can't come with us!
Old woman I am, not crippled.
He has a generator there.
Will the charge.
Does this still work?
- You Have the cable?
- Yes, here it is.
- Perfect! Brand new!
- Plug it in!
What is this?
- Don't be afraid. A sloth.
Completely harmless.
- What a cute little guy!
- So cute!
Look, he's smiling!
He winked at me!
This is it!
I won't spoil it? No, if
you don't leave this time.
Okay, let's go. Follow me and
stay close to each other.
Hey, you little sloth!
The bat cave! I don't
have bats, I hope.
- Alex, what are you doing?
- I'm Coming.
- Nice...
- Very nice!
I saw you! What did I do?
We are located in the most
beautiful room of the cave.
See the stalactites
and the stalagmites.
Admire the designs of
the Neolithic Period.
The Indians used to paint scenes
of everyday life, traditions.
- The childhood friends, Γιολάvτ it?
- You Got a problem?
Strange that plan.
This is the legend
of the Τσατσαούμ.
This is the wife of the
head of the tribe.
In accordance with the legend of the
Τσατσαούμ, as a sign of hospitality...
...the leaders offered
the woman the guests...
...I had to lie down with her.
Awesome!
We pass in the other room
that is closed to the public.
- The Indians left it, too?
- No, it's nothing.
German cavers, 40, were
caught by the rain.
- Seriously?
- Drowned.
- Krauts was. I don't mind.
- Out of the rain?
It has heavy rains in the area.
Flooded cave in a minute.
Very dangerous. What
are we doing here?
Frank, calm down. It never
rains this time of year.
Stay close to me, though.
It's a real maze.
Carefully... it's
42 miles of caves.
The first time I came, I got lost.
It took them a week to find me.
- A week! When did this happen?
- Last week.
Perfect! What?
I'm just kidding.
Don't be afraid.
I have a light, a compass, a GPS...
and flare!
As long as I'm with you,
nothing will happen. I know...
Damn it!
- We make a prank?
- Where did he go?
- We Need to find him.
- It Is very deep, I can't see the bottom.
- Wait, I have an idea!
- What's the idea?
- You'll see, trust me.
- Are you Kidding? Look.
I knew we shouldn't have come.
That's the only way we'll
know if it's deep.
I'm fine.
I can't believe it!
- Shit, it has no bottom, man!
- Why don't you take a rock?
- Now he's dead for sure!
- We Need to get down quickly.
When I was a kid
and I ran away...
...I was making a rope with
my clothes and it worked.
What?
- Go on, take your clothes off, girls.
- Ok.
- Not you, Γιολάvτ.
Take off all your clothes,
because it is very deep.
- I don't have to come.
- All of the clothes. Well done.
Help, if you can't.
- I can help you.
- Get your hands off me!
What a big fat rump!
- John, here we are!
- Alex, your shorts.
- I Prefer to wear it.
- Alex, we need all the clothes.
- No, you don't need.
- Give me your shorts!
Damn it! Seriously?
- Very nice thong!
- Put it back.
Now it is torn.
Put this on. Enough
horror I saw in the war.
Perfect!
- Do You Hear, John?
- No answer.
Here we come!
Actually, I had to tie...
Otherwise, it falls...
it seems kind of stupid.
- Go to the plane.
Didn't you hear the tour guide? It's
a maze, you won't find the exit!
You will find it! We
don't have a choice!
- See, he threw the flare.
- Good.
Here we come!
From here, all right?
John, still! Go
to call for help!
Too bad, it was a very
good idea of the clothes.
- My camera!
- What a disaster!
It came from the left.
Yes, look.
I go to the right. haven't
we been through here.
- I think we're lost.
- You shut up!
- We get It!
- Light! Light!
It's too high, we can't climb.
Ernest, you're taller,
go check it out.
- Why me?
- Our only chance to get out.
Come On, Ernest.
I Will die here.
Well, all right.
Be Careful. Slow!
Tell us if you see anything.
Are You okay? Yes,
my hand is caught.
What's good? This is stupid!
- We Need to get him out.
- Help him.
I thought it never rains here.
Fast! On the count of three!
1... 2... 3...
Stop!
- Loud!
- Loud! 1, 2, 3!
- It Hurts! It hurts!
- Nothing happens.
We have a problem. We can't
get him out and it's raining.
What do we do?
- I'll cut off your hand!
I heard the tour guide? We're all
gonna die here. We cut off his hand!
But what do you think? And in
"127 hours," cuts off his arm!
- That's a movie!
- Based on a true story!
- How do I cut it?
- I don't know.
Don't worry, my lad!
We'll get you out!
- With the machete!
- He's Right. It is the only solution.
Leave it dry and
take the machete.
Okay, as soon as I point to you,
grab him and leave him dry.
Julie, take my camera.
Are you completely crazy? We
don't cut the hand of Ernest!
- I Have To.
- I Agree with Frank.
It's raining! I will
not die here for him!
I'll just play less the bird.
- Mustafa, you are going to cut the hand!
- My name is Not Mustafa. Why me?
Don't slaughter the sheep?
What do you think?
- Okay, απεγκλωβίστηκα.
I confess, I was starting to worry.
You?
Now!
- Are you Stupid?
- Why did you do that?
- Get Up!
- Ernest, are you all right?
- Are You okay?
- Come On, Ernest!
My head Hurts!
You're such a jerk!
- I'm Sorry, I'll be cutting the hand.
- Shut Up!
See! Light!
We're not from here!
Damn it, I knew it! We're lost!
I will not lose the photo
shoot for the κωλοεκδρομή!
Give me the camera. It
will help Γιολάvτ. Give.
- Help us.
- Come On.
Come On, Γιολάvτ.
Ok. You're right, Γιολάvτ it?
Stop to think of me as a cripple!
Come On, Julie.
Okay... Come On...
Okay? Come On, Erica.
- Hello!
- Come on, come on!
Come on, you idiot!
Well done, my friend.
Come On, Alex.
I got something in my shorts!
I don't know! A bug! Help! Help!
Crazy! It looks like the
spider in the book for Brazil.
It bit me, I think.
Cut the plate. You
have 12 hours to cure.
- You Think or you sure it bit you?
- Sure, I think.
We need to know. Put
down the boxers.
- Yes, put it down.
- No Way.
Come on, we have
seen a lot of cocks.
In the locker room, I mean.
- Come on, take it down.
- Stand up and take it down.
- Pull Down the boxers!
- Are you sure?
Fruit?
Will not put up with someone
else to see you naked my own.
- Today is the big day!
- We have a small hitch.
- Something serious?
- No. It's all good.
My mother disappeared in the jungle
with friends of my daughter.
Oh, my god!
- Let's postpone it.
- No, we'll find them with the video.
It won't take long. Immediately
after, do the ceremony.
No problem. Take your time.
Above all, the family.
"Ομπριγκάvτο". Thank you.
Fernando!

How does this work?
Why'd you drop on it?
You arabs have a bit of an
issue with what he throws.
- You killed Him.
- I'm Hot. I'll die, I know.
We can't drag him. We
need to make a stretcher.
- I can't feel my leg.
- We take care of him.
- I Had to throw it next to him.
- He went out and fell on top of it.
- Any word from the tour guide?
- Has amnesia.
Has a lot of nerve.
- What is this again?
- Come close to me, I'm afraid.
It's a bird!
- Come...
- Stay by my side, you never know.

You didn't hear Jean-Pierre?
Are extinct species!
- No, than what you see.

Fortunately, I saw the turtles.
- What did you do to the turtles?
- Nothing.
- Damn, it hurts!
- A long time we have lost!
Let's Go, Frank, it hurts.
Yes, it hurts.
Isn't that great?
Cozy looks like.
The holdup is.
Say what you want, but
like Brittany does.
- Shit, a dead end!
- Damn it, you're gonna drop me!
I'm putting it down.
It is very heavy.
Not here, I'll wet my ass!
- Are You okay?
- I'll never find the plane.
Don't worry, we'll find it.
Thank you for the trip.
That's a great idea!
Please.
I don't want to be pessimistic,
but we're all gonna die!
To think that now I
would do sunbathing...
I'm sorry, the lady makes
with the stretcher.
Has gone away, huh?
They killed mom!
Has escaped the situation! Mr.
Lamar, we didn't mean it!
We didn't lose on purpose, mom!
Even the tour guide!
We're gonna die,
let's blame him!
Don't move!
- Damn It! A black panther!
- It's Not black, fool!
Damn it! A yellow panther.
Beautiful animal.
Don't move, kitty.
Wait...
- It's nothing.
Wait, I have an idea.
To take a commemorative selfie.
With that? To think
that we have a pistol!
- Animals don't know from guns.
- I will know that it is fake.
What the hell is this?
Damn it!
Cannibals. I'll eat them.
Bite from spider a banana, he says.
We have to let the poison out.
It looks like it really hurts.
What does the lord say?
- He's sucking out the poison.
- That's Right.
Guys, we found the sedan,
but not the Yolanda.
What's going on?
I don't know.
It takes him a blow job.
- No, it's sucking him in.
- It takes Him a blow job.
- Where do we go?
- I don't know, we're safe with them.

It touches me that you would say that.
Thank you.
Thank you... Great guy.
What did he say?
- I didn't understand, but it was nice.
Wait, I want to

See! The tour guide!
Will not go without a guide!
He never did anything to them.
We took off!
Awesome!

only in the Ρlaystatίοn.
A Bad thing. Yes,

Are you serious?
- We have a bit of a problem.

Impossible! Only the sea and trees!
Let me concentrate.

We're gonna die!
Shut Up, Erica!
It's your fault! I hate you!
We wanted to cheer you up!

- Don't run with a parachute!
- Forget it, girls. 'purpose.
Me, I know! I don't go

Very simple. Count to 30 and
pull the orange handle.
- As simple As that?

- No, it's not.
- The grandmother broke down the chute.
- Jump, children. I'll stay here.

Now you, Γιολάvτ!
I'm afraid of! I'm afraid of!
On the count of three...
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Oh, my god, I'm alive!
Where is the brake?
This must be it.
It's not the brake!
No, damn it! I don't

I have to say a word or two in the guide.
Too bad this trip!
We'll find a way to get you down.
I hope so.
Don't worry, I've got an idea.
My uncle is a fireman. He
had saved a cat like that.
Go away, you little sloth.
Spread the cloth. It
is not difficult.
Spread the cloth and jump.
What we've been
through on this trip!
You can say that again.
You're sure, huh?
And you don't know everything.
<-S -> What don't I know?
I did. What did you do?
With Frank! No! Did you do it?
When? Last.

I Was so wasted, I
don't remember.
Wait, Wait, honey!

- That's Right! Take advantage!
He's gone... that makes Sense.
What an asshole!
- Are You all right, Ernest it?

You're Right, it didn't work.
Comandante! The turtles!
I paid for the tickets?
Yeah, don't you remember?
- I Think it loses a little bit.
- Thank You.
Γιολάvτ, why are you
back on the bike?
To take this one.
What is it? You risked
your life for pictures?
They're all I have left
of my life in France.
When I broke my hip, my son
decided he can't live alone.
Who is this guy? The Μariο
Brοs in the most old!
Give it back! The Here my is.
A widower, he, too, like me.
I miss him very much, too.
Why do you stay here,
if you are not happy?
Jean-Pierre feels safe if I'm close.
For my own good.
Now I understand why he
is dedicated to ecology.
Shit, ecology! He throws
the garbage in the jungle.
Own the dump you
showed the Indians.
Where do you think
are the βρομόρουχά?
What a shame! The
toucan at the hotel!
But what is this?
Let's Go, Jacky. I've seen enough.
Wait, Wait, Michelle!
Terrible misunderstanding. It's all good.
Please don't go.
Find mom and I'll take
care of those responsible.
Thank You, Michelle.
You won't regret it.

Your friends made ecological
disasters, throw trash in the jungle!
And the best! Sleeping

A good ecological conscience!
You're a son of a bitch! And you!
