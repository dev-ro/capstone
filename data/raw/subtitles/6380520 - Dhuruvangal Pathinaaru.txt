'Let me share an episode as example'
'I was just 27 then'
'I had the police job
I liked so much'
'I had it all'
'Life presented a 'checkmate' for me'
'But even after that trauma
I was still happy'
'Once my colleague asked me'
'Even after such a huge tragedy'
'I had no solid answer then'
'With a slight smile
I changed the topic'
'But there are some issues
even time cannot cure completely'
'Like a permanent scar'
'It will never fade'
'Looking at it...'
'...only bad memories
will resurface'
'This can be dealt with in 2 ways'
'One is to keep thinking of it
and drowning in sorrow'
'The other is to adapt
and live along with it'
'I generally don't preach
this kind of philosophy'
'I took some time
to understand all this'
Who is this?
'Did you delete
my number so soon?'
My phone display is cracked, Rajan
How can I help you?
'Sir, I've told you
about my son, right?'
You've only told me
you have a son
But you haven't told me
anything else about him
'His name is Guru, sir'
'He graduated and is sitting
at home jobless for past 3 years'
'He's refusing to find a job insisting
he'll only join Indian Police Service'
Why be disappointed
of such good news?
'My wife wants him
to go abroad and work'
'But he is so stubborn about
joining the police force, sir'
Come to the point
What should I do?
'I have asked him
to meet you'
'Tell him how tough and
risky our department is'
'Brainwash him, sir'
'God bless you'
Do you realize how
unfair your wish is?
Asking me to make a man
on the right route to reverse
'I have tried all avenues, sir'
'He has no intention
of listening to me'
'My wife's blood pressure
is shooting up'
'You are my last hope, sir'
I'm here
'He isn't all that interested
in I.P.S at all, sir'
'This is a convenient excuse
not to go for a regular job'
'Seems best to
nip it in the bud'
Okay, I'll talk to him
Send him over
'Thank you so much, sir'
'I will ask him to
start right away'
'He'll be at your place in 2 hours'
'Sir, he's kind of brusque
Quite reserved'
'A little bit of a groucho
Kindly ignore all that, sir'
Okay, no problem
I'll handle it
'I will hang up'
I can't stand for
too long, sonny
The interior of my house
is being renovated
It won't be comfortable inside
We can sit out here and chat
Varnish is over, sir
- How much do you want?
- Rs 500, sir
In a year or so, you'll be
settled in U.S.A or U.K
If it's possible, send me
a good walking stick
Indian brands are not
worth a naya paisa!
Like your father, you want
to join the Police department
Like your father, you want to
be a distinguished officer, right?
I'm the only one talking
from the moment you arrived
It is slightly awkward
Next only if you talk...
...I will continue
You can leave
after drinking your tea
(clears throat)
How did you get this limp?
I didn't expect
such a harsh question
My last case gave me
this as a retirement gift
I have heard a lot about
that psycho killer case
To be honest...
...my dream to become
a police officer
...was born because of that case
But I am sure
you would not have...
...had a chance to find out
the emotional stress and danger
If you were aware
of the details...
...you will definitely
reconsider this profession
Sir, the only reason I'm here
is to find out all about this case
I need to know the extent
of your interest before I tell you
You said you have heard
a lot about that case, right?
Tell me what you know
Then I'll decide whether I should
share any detail with you or not
I don't know 100%
But I'll mix fact and fiction
(song on car-radio)
Hey! Not this song again, please?
Ideal for night time
Monkey! When did you
send a 'request'?
I didn't
She added me
Don't pull a fast one on us
You would've started flirting
the next second with her
I'm not that lame, okay?
Then accept
you gave the 'request'
Why thrive on false prestige?
Listen! I did not add directly
Showed in suggestion list
and same college too
You're such a cheapskate
If you call me names
I'll make mincemeat out of you
Fabi, let's get out of here
Hold his hand
Hey! What are you doing?
I can't explain now
Just do as I say
Lunatic!
Quick, get in
Listen to me
Ours is the only car
plying on this road
Everyone in this area is aware
Tomorrow if they find
a body lying in a pool of blood
...they won't even enquire
They will drag us by
the scruff of our collars
Only if they find a body
it's an accident!
As of now only we are aware of this
Let it remain that way
In a couple of hours the milkman and
newspaperman will be out in the road
Then we can't do anything
Just for tonight
let this body be in the trunk
Without getting caught let us decide
tomorrow how to safely dispose the body
If a mistake happens
think how to wriggle out of it
Instead if we hold our head
in our hands we achieve nothing
Stop...stop
Hey! Stop the car
- Where are you going?
- Going home
- Where is your house?
- Closeby, Ambedkar nagar
Show me your license
Did it rain inside your car, huh?
- You are drenched to the skin
- We didn't raise the window in time
Blow
Blow hard
Get the breathalyzer
We'll pay the fine
Tell us how much
You can pay all that
1st get down
I'm willing to pay the fine
Shut up and get down
Get down
All of you
Why are you getting drenched?
Stand over there
I'll join you soon
Yellow Tshirt
Come here
Hold the umbrella
Looking shifty eyed
Something fishy
- Got college in the morning
- Stashed any drugs?
Late night
Let us go, sir
Okay, move
Come to the station
and collect your car
- Got the key?
- Yes, sir
Drive the car to the station
Sir, no need station
All we had was a beer each
Trust us, sir
- Take the car
- Not tanked at all, sir
- What are you doing?
- Get in
What?
We are already in a big mess
You dragged a new problem into it
Blaming me, huh?
I'll dump the body in the road
You know how to manage, go ahead
Wait...wait
- Making it worse
- Why did you hit that cop?
If I had kept quiet
we'll be holed up in a cell
I was talkin-
We can forget
about our future
I was talking to him
Why did you hit him?
He noted our car number
Listen! Hitting a traffic cop
is a case of no consequence
Even if the police tried to trace us
it will take them minimum 3 days
You know the car is
registered in Chennai, right?
In the 3 days meanwhile, it's enough
if we think of a plan to dispose the body
After that if they catch us
we are safe
He may thrash us in the station
At the worst
detain us for a week
This is much better than
eating gruel for a lifetime
You don't have to
thank me for saving you
But you point a finger at me
I'll be furious
We haven't mentioned about the boys
and this accident in any of our records
How do you know this?
Don't think like a typical policeman
This is called fieldwork
What else do you know?
That's all
You must fill up the blanks
I have no problem
telling you the rest of it
But after that...
Let me be the judge
How can you be so sleepy
early in the morning?
Why don't you arrange it
one at a time?
'What is the rush now
to pile up everything?'
We have been trying
your mobile from last night
I left it behind here
You could have
tried my landline
- Landline?
- Forgot to tell you
Yesterday I got
a new connection
- What's the matter?
- A suicide in our area, sir
Hanging or
consuming poison?
Bharathi park road
Gunshot, sir
- Who?
- Boy's name is Krish, sir
This is his license
Who gave you
the information?
He is waiting outside
I'll bring him in
You are under lock up
Don't forget that
No personal calls
during duty hours
'I'll talk to you later'
Hey! Sonny
Come here
There's a carpet of
dried leaves at the rear
'Will you get your car
the moment you complain?'
'Do you know how many
complain in 1 day?'
I'll keep it on your table
He is the one
Yov! Tell our Inspector
what you saw early this morning
'Sir, I deliver 'Dinathanthi' newspaper'
'On the way to the depot this morning
I saw a man lying by the roadside'
'Thinking he had fainted
I went up to him'
'He had a bullet wound in his head'
What time was this?
Around 2:30 a.m I think
I came and informed
the station at once, sir
Give your address
to the writer
Okay, sir
- Has the body been cleared?
- Yes, sir
Mr Adityan from
Crime Squad cleared it
It's a residential area
Not wanting the residents to panic
we did it as fast as we could, sir
Have you informed his family?
Not yet, sir
Do that fast
1 minute, sir
Yov! Why are you
screaming your head off?
Sir, 1 minute
Come with me
What's the matter?
I saw a white car
at the park this morning
It went past our station now
Which car?
I know only the color
What are you blabbering?
Is this the only white car on the road?
It was parked outside
the station all this while, sir
Before I could come in
and tell you it sped past
Okay, all that is
part of our job
You go attend to your work
- What is the problem?
- Nothing, sir
He saw a white car
in the crime scene
He says he saw the same car in front
of our station and it sped past him now
Which car?
We didn't see any such car
when we went, sir
Give me your mobile
I'm calling from
my constable's mobile
'From early morning, we have
been trying to reach you'
'What happened to your mobile?'
I left it behind in the station
That's why I called you
Is the postmortem over?
Doctor says the report will
be ready only by this evening
I'll ping you
when it's done
I wanted to tell you
Rajan thinks this is suicide
What?
To claim the victim shot himself
at the park seems a little odd, right?
The gun had fingerprints
of only the deceased
That too in the rain
it was really faded
So we thought
this maybe a suicide
I am on the way
to the crime spot
After checking, I'll call you
if I need any other information
Whole of today I will be
using only this mobile
So next time,
don't ask me who this is!
Is this the crime scene?
Over there, sir
- Any police map?
- No, sir
Mr Adityan vetoed it
not wanting to attract a crowd
Get me a glass of water
Did he say he saw
the white car here?
Sir, we didn't see any car
when we arrived here
He has simply exaggerated
thinking he'll get a reward
The media is not in the loop, right?
No, sir, we haven't
informed anyone as yet
Case was filed by
a newspaperman
Yes, sir
If it leaks out
we will be in a mess
Don't worry, sir
I'll take care
Clean the car
on that side
I can't be sure
who did this
But I have 3 suspects in mind, sir
Who...?
'3 boys who live
in this area, sir'
'They take this route
Real late hours at night'
'I have seen them often'
'They look like
affluent boys, sir'
'There's a good chance
of them owning a gun'
Either they should be
connected with this case
Or I feel if we interrogate them,
we'll get some clues for sure
- Do you think so?
- Just a gut feeling
Whatever a policeman believes
he must trust his intuition!
That's why
What if your intuition is wrong?
In most of the crimes
with no clues...
...the criminal has to be caught within
48 hours is an unwritten rule, right?
But according to Crime Branch
this could be a suicide case
Shooting a man and
placing a gun in his hand
We don't have any
evidence or clues as yet
How will we nab him?
Sir, please don't think
I am crossing my limits
But if I don't ask you this,
my head will explode
Instead of just holding a stick...
...and doing a watchman's job
...I want to get involved
in such cases, sir
Do what is only assigned
to you by your superiors
Don't unnecessaril-
What is your name?
I joined duty only yesterday
I was informed of
the 2 new recruits
I couldn't meet them
Call our station
Ask someone else
to come to the spot
Gautham will be
with us in this case
- Are you sure this is the house?
- Yes, sir
The red Skoda
is right there
Check the car thoroughly
Can I come in?
Do you know
why we are here?
No
There was a robbery
in the adjacent street
They have threatened
the owner with a gun
We don't possess any gun
I never asked you
Just wanted to check if the robbers
are hiding in your house
Who owns this house?
It's in my name
Your name means?
- What is your name?
- Fabian
What about you both?
Sir, I'm Melvin
And he's Mano
Only the 3 of you stay
in such a big house?
No, sir, monthly once
his dad will come here
We have maintenance staff
Where do you work?
I guess 'sir' doesn't feature
in your vocabulary?!
It does
We'll be the owners of your place
from now on for a while
Check every nook and corner in
this place for robbers or toy guns
All clear, I checked thoroughly
- Trunk?
- Locked, sir
- Give me the key
- We came home late last night
Don't know where the key is, sir
It must be in the house
How can it vanish? Get it fast
- May take time to search
- Don't give excuses to an officer
Key must be misplaced-
Won't you know
where you left the key?
There's no connection between
this murder and these 3 boys
But I am sure they are
hiding something from us
What is your intuition, Gautham?
They need to be
watched closely, sir
Who is AJ?
Our head constable Jana
Park the car
next to the kerb
Tell me
When...?
Okay
Address?
In half an hour-
He's here
Who called the station?
Sir, I did
I'm Shruti's neighbor, Ganesh
I live in flat #2B
First witness, huh?
No, sir, I didn't even
go into her apartment
Around 7 o'clock Shruti's friend
knocked on my door
In a state of panic she said the room was
full of blood and Shruti was missing
I had no idea what to do
I dialed 100 at once
and called the cops
'Can't you see the steps?'
'If the furniture gets damaged,
will you take responsibility?'
'What can I say?'
'Lift it...lift'
When did you call the station?
Must be around 7:30 p.m, sir
He said he'll be here
in 5 minutes
But I had to wait
for nearly 2 hours
That's why I called again
15 minutes ago to remind them
Rajan, he called at 7:30 p.m
Then why were we informed so late?
Sir, 1 minute
Actually at 7:30
we were near the park
Only the new constable
was in the station
He noted down the address
but forgot to inform us I think, sir
Gautham is also new, right?
Call that constable
Sir, I don't have
his phone number
Rajan, don't give me such excuses
Call Jana and connect me
I'll talk to the new recruit
- Your name?
- Vaishnavi, sir
Explain what happened
in detail to me
- Is this house key always with you?
- Yes, sir
Every weekend I will
come here from Chennai
My arrival time is indefinite
So the spare key is always with me
- What do you do in Chennai?
- I work in CTS as Program Executive, sir
Do you have your bus ticket?
Are you related to Shruti?
When did you last speak to Shruti?
Yesterday evening, sir
When did you say
you came here?
I reached Chennai
only at 6:30 a.m, sir
Approximately
Call Shruti's mobile-
It's switched off
What happened?
I called him, sir
No one picked up
I think he'll call after
seeing my 'missed' call
Got any relatives in Coimbatore?
No, sir
You know Mr Ganesh well, right?
Not really, I've spoken to him
a couple of times when I was here
Because we can't allow
anyone inside the house
If you want to refresh,
you can go to his house-
Can you accommodate her
in your house for a day?
We don't mind
We still haven't got
a clear picture of anything
Until we resolve this...
...you need to stay
only in Coimbatore
I'll make alternate
arrangements for your stay
Where is Gautham?
I'll call him, he's talking
to the watchman upstairs
Ask the watchman to come down
Investigate in
the other apartments
I will send someone
from the Crime Branch
- Let me check around once
- Go ahead
You work night shift
or day shift?
Yesterday were you
in the apartment then?
Yes, sir
Too many flats here
It is tough to remember
Still try to think and tell me
When did Shruti
enter her flat?
Don't know the exact time, sir
But when I came for work,
Shruti's scooty was parked here
When did you come?
Please don't tell the secretary
I will lose my job, sir
I had gone to my hometown
I came back only at 5:00 a.m, sir
When did the day shift
watchman leave?
He left at 8:30, sir
Is there a security camera?
What, sir?
It is usually fixed
in the parking lot
We don't have all that
The new constable
has called from the station
You carry on
Suresh, the new constable
You joined work only yesterday
New atmosphere
You are very young
Because of these reasons
when someone complains...
...no rules stipulate you shouldn't
inform higher officials, Suresh
'Sir, please forgive me'
'I thought it was a prank call'
'Seemed like he was telling me
a serious issue in a playful way, sir'
Our network is like this
When it is an emergency call...
...it won't come to our station
It is linked to the control room
The control room will
receive the complaint
And only then inform
our police station
Officers in the control room will not
know the seriousness of this situation
They will treat everything lightly
Understood?
'You've said I should not
give any reasons'
'But other than the fact
I'm new to the job...'
'...I don't know
what else to say'
Please learn the basics
Think and let me know
Any other key piece of information...
...not conveyed to us?
'Aren't you in Shruti's flat
in Saroj Prayag apartments?'
Yes
'Shruti came to our station yesterday
and complained about eve teasing, sir '
Against whom?
'Didn't give a proper address, sir'
'But she specified the area
as Ambedkar Nagar'
'The boy's name is Mano, sir'
Who is Mano?
I'll ask you some questions now
Just answer yes or no
Okay...?
Do you know Shruti living
in Saroj Prayag apartments?
Yes, sir
Have you spoken to her?
Yes, sir
Have you stalked her?
No, sir
- Threatened to kill her?
- No way, sir
You said you know her
10 days ago-
'That girl was riding a scooty
She almost banged into our car'
'She apologized and accepted
it was her fault and left, sir'
'That's all'
'That was the first time I met her'
Did she ride fast or
were you speeding?
She was the one who swerved
too much to the left
You look decent
Then why did she complain
against you for eve teasing?
When did you last see that girl?
10 days ago when
this incident happened
Can you please tell us why
you called us to the station?
Finally looks like
you used the word 'sir'
Shruti who lived in Saroj Prayag
near your house is missing
The interesting part here is...
...she has lodged an eve teasing complaint
against a Mano residing in Ambedkar Nagar
This reason is good enough
to investigate you!
Is he the only Mano in our area?
Yes...'sir'!
If you don't believe me...
...check the voters list
of Ambedkar Nagar
Only Mano in that area is your friend
'How can there be
no other Mano?'
Give me your mobile
Any problem, sir?
My phone is not charging
It's switched off
Plug it in that socket
Hello, Adityan
'Process is going on'
Not about that
I'm handling a small case
A girl in this area is missing
Found traces of blood
in her bedroom
Can you please seal
that place immediately?
'We still haven't cleared
this case, sir'
But what to do?
'What is the address?'
I'll text it to you
Constable Gautham will be in the spot
You can coordinate with him
Any idea how the case
might have travelled after this?
I know where this will end
But there are a few missing links
in between which aren't very clear
Isn't it boring to watch the film
knowing what the climax is, right?
It depends on the way
you narrate your story
'After informing Adityan...'
'...I told those 3 boys to wait
in the station and I left'
'That's where I got
the first hint in the murder case'
'The bullet in Krish's head was 9 mm'
'This is used by policemen'
Check inside
Doesn't look like a fight
or robbery in the crime scene
While checking we found
Shruti's identity card
In fact yesterday
was Shruti's birthday
According to Shruti's I.D card
her blood group was O+
But we checked
the blood group on the wall
Sir, what happened
to the other case?
Can I sit here?
Most girls have problems
because of relationship issues
So you think we should start
from her point of view
I already did, sir
He's like that
He will surprise me
every now and then
Tell me, Mr Gautham
What did you infer?
I interrogated everyone here, sir
'According to everyone
Shruti stays alone'
'No parents or guardians'
'But I believe a guy
visits her now and then'
'Once her neighbor in flat #3A
asked Shruti about him'
'She told him he was her fiancé'
'He is the only one who has seen
that guy in this apartment'
Boy's name is Krish
This is his license
What did you say was
the blood group on the wall?
'Once her neighbor in flat #3A
asked Shruti about him'
'He is the only one who has seen
that guy in this apartment'
Sir, was it this man you saw?
Our 1st priority
To find out who the boy is
Shruti complained about
Sir, what about that Mano?
In Shruti's case it doesn't
look like they are lying
Their answers seem to be convincing
Crime Branch team has come
You don't have to be here
Go to Ambedkar Nagar and do
the same questioning you did here
I'll go up and
get my cap
You are a 90s kid, right?
You would've definitely
played the Mario game
In the beginning
of that game
There are 3 lives
You'll jump across
in some spot
You'll get a 'life' from
a magic brick over there
Do you know?
But I didn't get
anything of that sort
You will get
Same holds good
in all cases
There will be
a magic brick
You don't have to go
in search of it
The brick will come
in search of you
- Agreed, but how can you refuse?
- Don't torture me, sir
It seems he can't give it back
I won't give it, sir
- What happened?
- Look at them
They are hell bent on taking
a film in front of the apartment
They are torturing me, sir
We were only shooting a short film
We didn't disturb anyone, sir
This is a residential area
Sir, we didn't disturb anyone
He is exaggerating, sir
We have a competition tomor-
Sir, we have to edit tomorrow
All our files are in there, sir
Collect it from the station
in the evening
For 6 months
we've been work-
Enquire in every house
Make sure you mark
even the slightest doubt
I'll do the needful, sir
'Sir, I'm Gautham speaking'
'Yes, Gautham'
'What is Shruti's complaint
against Mano?'
'He has stopped her in the middle of
the road yesterday and created a ruckus'
'That girl has used a string
of cuss words on him'
'And livid with rage has
complained in the station'
Krish's father, sir
He's here to complain
about his missing son
Didn't I tell you this morning
to inform him?
You had Krish's license
I didn't note down
his address
Is that a valid reason, Rajan?
Ask him to be seated inside
Sir, please wait inside
I had asked you about
taking off, sir?
Boys, give your mobile number here
I am at the station
- We'll call you anytime
- I'll meet the Inspector and come
Sir will be here soon
Please be seated
'You can leave now'
'But tomorrow I want
to see all 3 of you'
Have you given a complaint?
What can I do for you?
My name is Sriram
My son is usually back home
by 9'o clock every night
He is missing from last night
He messages if he is delayed
We didn't get any message either
My wife is very worried
That's why I thought
I should let you know
Sir, this boy's father-
I was also a police officer
I was posted in Delhi
I retired 5 years ago and
I'm settled now in Chennai
Sorry, I didn't salute you
as my senior officer
No formalities at all
I need to tell you something
I don't know how you will take it
Someone has shot your son
When?
This morning
Who...er...why?
Don't know
We are searching
To see parents lose
their children and grieve...
...there isn't a more
depressing sight you know
I'm not in the frame
of mind to talk now
I'll come to the station tomorrow
He was our only son
How will I break
this news to my wif-
I don't know
If Adityan calls, ask him to
get in touch with me in my landline
You are on night duty, right?
Yes, sir
Sir, is your mobile alright now?
I think it's charged
I'll switch it on
at home and check
All those in the spot today
can report to work tomorrow evening
Hello, Deepak
Someone was waiting in front
of your house for a long time
Who?
Must be around 6:00 p.m
I saw him when I was getting
back home from my walk
I don't know where
he went after that
Okay, let me see tomorrow
'The mobile number
you are calling is switched off'
'Sir, I'm Rajan speaking'
'There are 2 college boys here'
'It seems you asked them to collect
their camera this evening at the station'
Completely skipped my mind
It is in my car, Rajan
Ask them to collect it tomorrow
'Okay, sir'
'It seems they want
the camera tonight'
'The required files are in it
for their competition tomorrow'
'They worked so hard for a month
They are cribbing their heads off'
Ask them to come home
and pick it up
Which college?
K.L.M, sir
Why are you so perturbed?
I'll give it to you
What is your film about?
Fregoli delusion
Based on that condition
- Name?
- Name of the film, sir?
'Prathi'
'Reflection'
Tomorrow is the competition
And you say the files are
still in the camera today
Don't you have lots to do
after shooting it?
We've taken the final output
Just for safety we were
shooting an alternate climax
Whatever! If such an expensive
camera is confiscated...
...you know it is tough
to get it back
I'll return it
I don't have any problem
But you didn't shoot any girl
What is the guarantee
you shot only a film?
Sir, we took only
4 shots last night
Before we could shoot today
the watchman grabbed it from us
If you want we can...
...show you what we took
and then take it, sir
'Are you ready?'
'Just a minute, dude
Lighting has gone for a toss'
'- Hurry up!
- Are we shooting in Red?'
(memorizing dialogs)
'Do it fast'
'Gawd! You come just to
disturb us, huh?'
'Hey buddy
A cool chick!'
'Auto, anna
Please move'
'When did you say
you came here?'
'I reached Chennai
only at 6:30 a.m, sir'
'Approximately'
'Can't you focus properly?'
'A white car, sir
I know only that'
- When did you shoot this video?
- 11:00 p.m, sir
- The time you went to the apartment
- 10:30 p.m, sir
We shot for half an hour
Then it started raining heavily
- Around 11:10
- I think so
We left by 11:10 p.m, sir
- Was that car parked there when you came?
- Yes, sir
Take that card
Other than the girl did you see
anyone else go into that flat?
When we reached there and
we were preparing, we saw 1 man go in
Any snap or video of him?
Who was taking the 'making' video?
Call him
it's okay, call
Keep trying, he won't
pick up immediately
Low battery in my phone
- Rajan
- Tell me, sir
Give me Gautham's contact number
1 minute
Sir, will you note it down?
Don't get me wrong
Don't take off
till tomorrow evening
Report to duty
in the morning
That's no problem at all
Dial that number
Even on the 1st day I believed
you'll recognize my voice
Phone voice sounds different, right?
Did you enquire
in that area?
I knocked at
all the doors, sir
There isn't any Mano
who will fit our sketch, sir
Is there anyone else
by that name?
At #10 there is an 86 year old
by the name of Manoranjan, sir
He will return it
Stop bugging me
Do you feel I'm making you work
too hard on your very 1st day?
I think this case is a warm welcome
to the Police department, sir
Then I don't need to take permission
to make you work overtime, eh?
I've got an important break
I called you to
ask your opinion
Come home right away
Okay, sir, I'll be there
in 20 minutes
My addres-
Don't fuss too much
Your camera is safe
In your excitement
should not miss important details
I'll be there
Mufti or uniform, sir?
Do either of you intend
joining the Police force?
No, sir
You should have seen
the reaction of those 2 boys
Having stumbled on a clue
I got so hyper
Those boys were quite terrified
There is still some time left
What did you infer
from this video?
Vaishnavi is hiding
something from us, sir
You don't have any doubts
on the car parked outside the apartment?
That newspaper chap said
he saw a white car, right?
It may also belong to
someone in the apartment
Why would the resident
park it outside then?
Call Vaishnavi
She just stepped out
for a walk, sir
It's 10:00 p.m now
She went for a walk at this hour?
She left a while ago
Whole day she was
quite disturbed
She said she may feel better
if she went for a walk
Okay, give me
her mobile number
What happened, sir?
Are her belongings in here?
She brought just 1 bag
She has kept it inside
When is the last bus to Chennai?
One at 10:15 p.m and
another at 10:30 p.m, sir
Let's go
'Someone was waiting in front
of your house for a long time'
'Who?'
'Whole day she was
quite disturbed'
'She said she may feel better
if she went for a walk'
'10 days ago'
'That girl was riding a scooty
She almost banged into our car'
'She apologized and accepted
it was her fault and left, sir'
'That was the first time I met her'
'- When did you last see that girl?
-10 days ago when this happened'
'Why would the resident
park it outside then?'
She might have booked her ticket
in some other name, sir
If we trace her
with her mobile number...
...we can nab her before dawn
Tell me, sir
Get me details of this car
and let me know
Do you suspect anyone
at this stage?
Yes, sir
But only theories
Not confirmed
It's okay, tell me
When I went to investigate
in Ambedkar Nagar...
...most houses complained
only about one chap
Fabian
Some said he is very rude
Some called him a ladies' man!
My theory is...
...Shruti wanted to
complain against Fabian
The 3 of them stick together
like 3 musketeers
There is a possibility
of a name mix up
This is from my personal experience
'Even if they are
the best of friends...'
'...they won't share
their dirty secrets'
'Without Melvin and
Mano's knowledge...'
'...Fabian could have stalked Shruti'
- Where are you going at this hour?
- To the police station, sir
What happened to your face?
Am I the only one in the dark
or are you as clueless?
You usually have
a ready explanation
What about this?
How many times
have I told you?
First stop getting flustered
This isn't as serious
as you make it out to be
Okay, listen to me without
interrupting or getting nervous
Some chap has witnessed
our accident yesterday
'After we fought, we ensured
the trunk was locked'
'But we didn't press
the central lock button'
'So he must have
followed our car'
'And after we entered our house...'
'...using the driver seat's lever
he must have got the body out'
'Whoever did this...'
'...is expecting a ransom from us'
In case we refuse to oblige...
...he'll be in the mindset to
take this matter to the police
Boss
Need to talk to you in
private about something
I have told you
we don't want newspaper
Oh no! This isn't about
delivering the newspaper
It's about your mug shots
in the News tomorrow!
Boss, why are you standing?
Sit down, this is
your house after all
What is this private matter?
You want to know, huh?
Early this morning a newspaper boy
was cycling past our Bharathi park
He suddenly heard the brakes
of a car screech to a halt
When he got off his cycle
and rushed to check...
...he saw 3 boys like you
Their car hit a guy, they threw him
into the trunk and they whizzed away!
That newspaper chap is damn decent
He hasn't informed
this matter to the police
If I had been in his shoes I would
have informed the cops definitely
Later an idea struck that chap
If he shares this information
with the police...
...he won't be richer
even by a rupee
Those boys will also be
behind bars unnecessarily
But if he meets the concerned culprits
and discusses terms with them...
...and his wallet becomes fatter
...then the benefit is mutual
Do you agree with me, huh?
How much?
If I stay awake for a whole month
and deliver newspapers I'll save 3000
For a year, 2 x 50 x-
I can only save Rs 20000
I'm now 29 years old
For the next 40 years I'm hoping
I'll be alive and kicking
If you place 1 million on this table...
...I'll just grab the pile and scoot
I won't face you ever again
What do you say?
Come after 2 hours
Money will be ready
Can I trust you?
I give you my word
When he blackmailed us
we should have thrown him out
Why get scared of him?
Think about it
Are you sure
only he knows this?
Let's first give in
to his demand
If he takes it
and keeps quiet...
...then no one else
is aware of this for sure
I know only too well
how to get back my money
Until then just do what I say
Don't chicken out
and die of fear
Hello, dad
- You withdrew from our account?
- Yes, I did
To buy the property
near Tiruppur we decided on
My salary hasn't been credited as yet
I urgently need 1 million, dad
Hey! Why so much?
I have only 50,000 at the moment
Will pay the balance later
What is this, boss?
You promised 1 followed by 6 zeroes
and now it is 2 zeroes less!
Okay, I'll adjust
What about the rest?
I'll give the balance later
Come and collect it in a week
'After we left the station...'
'...he came again and
demanded money, sir'
'After all it's an accident'
'I said it is better to
confess to the cops'
'Then we don't have to pay him
and we will also be safe'
'Fabian got angry and hit me'
'I thought the police
should be informed of this'
'That's why I came
without their knowledge'
Where did the accident take place?
Right here, sir
How did he look?
Can you recollect any details?
I was so petrified
nothing registered in my mind
You leave now
If your friends ask you...
...act as if the cops are
unaware, I'll take care
Sir, that newspaper man
Hereafter he won't bother you
1 minute
Arrange the information we have
got so far in chronological order
Last night Vaishnavi went
to the apartment at 11
The accident was at 2:00 a.m
Near the same park, same time,
Shruti's boyfriend was shot
Then-
At 7:00 a.m Vaishnavi has
complained to her neighbor
She escaped at 10:00 p.m
That newspaper chap
was there in the accident spot
What are the possibilities he could
have witnessed the murder too?
Plenty, sir
'S.Marimuthu
Raghavendra street'
Hello...!
Won't you invite us in?
Come in, sir
My clothes are strewn
all over the place
If you don't mistake me-
What is this, sir?
Sir, what are you doing?
Why, sir-
Even though it's a small place
he has maintained it very well
Don't stay here from now on
There are very nice apartments
for 800,000 in Mettupalayam
Better shift there
With the balance 200,000
start something on your own
Life will be very good
I made a mistake
Please forgive me, sir
I won't trouble
those boys again, sir
I will confess
everything to you, sir
The word 'truth' has a meaning
That is, to say what you saw exactly
Shouldn't swallow some
and with the remainder...
...shouldn't blackmail young boys
If you can convince us
you are being 100% honest...
...we'll leave without
even uttering a single word
But in case it is not true...
...and if we think
you're lying to us
...we'll tie you up
in the middle of the road
I will ask those boys
to run their car over you!
I'll confess, sir
Tell me
I was on my way to the depot
to collect the newspaper
'A man was sprawled
on the road near a white car'
'To check what had happened,
I went closer, sir
'I am not that lame, okay?'
'He had been shot'
'If you call me names
I'll make mincemeat out of you'
'I heard a car skid
on the opposite road, sir'
'When I went to check
what happened...'
'...the car hit a pedestrian, the boys
tossed him into the trunk and left'
'Immediately I went to the police station
and informed only about the gun'
'I didn't utter a word
about the accident'
I blackmailed those boys
only for money, sir
I swear I don't know
anything else, sir
So you didn't remove
that body from the trunk?
What will I do
with a dead body, sir?
Was it this car
you saw in the park?
Same car, sir
- You saw the car at the spot?
- No, sir
Does it take this long
to trace a car number?
Come, just can't
trust these chaps
Did constable Rajan give
a car number to trace?
He did, sir
- I've messaged the details
-To whom?
Rajan sir
1 minute
The message wasn't sent
I'll check it right now
The killer must have seen
these boys hit the man
After they left, he must have
taken the car and followed them
He must be the one who
removed the body from the trunk
I thought of this too
But Vaishnavi lying to us
Traces of blood
in the apartment
What about all this?
'Visualize what I tell you now'
'Can't confirm this is what
would have exactly happened'
'With all the leads
we've received until now...'
'...all I am saying is it could
have happened this way'
'While they were
celebrating her birthday'
'We don't know who he is'
'There must have been
a third person in that apartment'
'But as soon as the killer
enters the apartment...'
'...the 3rd person assaults him'
'He goes to Shruti's room
and assaults Krish'
'Exactly at that time...'
'...Vaishnavi enters the apartment'
'He points the gun at her and threatens
to kill her if she squeals to anyone'
'Just to make others believe...'
'...he leaves Vaishnavi out'
'He takes the 3 of them
at gun point with him in the car'
'When they are driving past the park...'
'...Krish must have tried to escape'
'Vaishnavi's boyfriend...'
'...tries to escape by jumping
over the park fence'
'He frames Krish's death as suicide'
'What happened after this,
I don't have to explain'
'The newspaper man watches this
entire incident from outside the park'
'That killer watches the same
from inside the park'
'After these boys leave...'
'...the newspaper boy
rushes to the police station'
'Following Fabian's car...'
'...that killer leaves the spot too'
'After the boys enter their house...'
'...the killer removes the body
from the car trunk'
'Both the bodies have to be...'
'...in the white Dzire car
we are looking for'
Aren't my connections logical?
Chances are high
it happened this way
But what's the motive?
There isn't any necessity
all murders should have a motive
From your hint it seems like
we are chasing a psycho killer
Registered in the name
of Mr Krishnasamy
Hello, yes?
'Sir, I'm calling from
Tiruppur bypass'
'A stranger just tossed something
from his car into a pond, sir'
Explain clearly
'He opened his car trunk and flung
something huge into the pond, sir'
What vehicle, sir?
'White Dzire, sir'
Leg needs to be amputated
'Few days ago...'
'...a youngster named Krish was found
mysteriously dead in Bharathi park'
'On the same day a girl
named Shruti went missing'
'A youngster called Mano
is the reason behind this'
'Since he was averse to the close
bond between Krish and Shruti'
'He shot Krish and
has kidnapped Shruti'
'According to police reports'
'The police force is on
a witch-hunt for Mano'
Sir, this is Rajan here
I was talking
for so long, Rajan
Sir, please don't mistake me
My son found out why
I asked you to meet him
He refused to meet you
Please don't take it to heart
Who are you?
You should've asked me this
right in the beginning
You chatted with me as if
you knew me for 10 years
I played along
If I had revealed my true identity maybe
you wouldn't have opened up to this extent
So long to take out this?
I'm Krish's brother
Get inside
Don't come out
until I call you
Go inside
I know you've seen
that murderer's face
But when the police questioned
you didn't divulge any information
A man can control all his emotions
But after knowing this person
should be behind bars or dead
...if he is wandering scot free happily
a rage within will erupt you know
It's hard to control that anger
Then only this...
...will help a lot of
people get justice
Even when you knew the killer,
you didn't do anything
Why...?
Let me tell you
If you are mad at me...
...shoot me after I explain
No one will stop you
Policemen are a tad too arrogant
Need not be obligated for a lifetime
to someone who spared his life!
You should certainly
be aware of this
Why did you leave
without informing us?
I got a call from work asking me
to come immediately, sir
That's why I had to leave
Then I tried calling sir's cell
but it was switched off
Only now I heard about this
Did all this happen
when sir came in search of me?
No
Vaishnavi is here
Just a minute, sir
I'll get lunch for you
Sir, I didn't commit any mistake
I want to confess
the truth to you
After that whatever
decision you take...
Whom do you want to-
Shruti's friend
I came to wish her
for her birthday
No, she is inside
I spoke to her just now
She wanted to take a shower
Can I get you some juice?
What's his name?
He's my college friend, Prem
Haven't you planned
a birthday celebration?
We've planned something
without Shruti's knowledge
He lives in Nasik
But no one is aware
of his arrival today
How do you know Shruti?
We live in the same area
We talk quite often
Mano, please leave
before I behave harshly
Hey! I am talking to you-
Krish is my real name
I believe you went to
the police station yesterday?
I knew you'll attempt
something like this
That's why a month ago
when we first met...
...I introduced myself as Mano!
You haven't told me
your name as yet
Shruti and I need to talk
- Can you wait there?
- N...no
Go now
I might have met you
a few times to talk to you
But you didn't talk to me
even once properly
Even I bided my time and
was patient beyond normal limits
I came here to wish you
on your birthday
Think you can yell at me and humiliate me
in front of all those people publicly?
That's all
I thought of approaching you
with an excuse of love or relationship
You won't allow a man
to be decent, right?
I believe he is also
in love with you
We need only Shruti
In your best interest
be silent
Hey! Get out
Listen carefully
all 3 of you
You get it, right?
In case you want to
get us caught by the Police...
...we have nothing to lose
But before that...
...think about this
at least once
What if you go viral?
Dude, when is my turn?
Her life is in our hands, dude
Don't panic
Just do what I say
After a while, knock on
your neighbor's door
Tell him Shruti is missing
Come to the airport
after 10:00 p.m
Both of you stay in Nasik
till I let you know it's safe
In case you think I am lying
You've heard all that
you wanted to know
Tell me at least now
Who are you?
Every single word I heard that day
is etched in my memory
Krish's father told us
he was his only son
Who are you?
'Police officer Mr Deepak and his recruit
Gautham were in an accident last night'
'Deepak who was severely injured...'
'...was forced to have
his right foot amputated'
'Since the vehicle had caught fire
during the accident...'
'...Gautham suffered
severe burn injuries'
'It is feared he might
have slipped into coma'
Gautham, can you hear me?
For the last 5 years
you've been asleep
In medical terms,
you were in coma
When you were admitted immediately
after the accident, this was your condition
Good news here is...
...we've grafted your face
without any scars
But the bad news is...
...we couldn't retain
your original facial features
Since you've been silent
the last 5 years...
...your voice has deepened
In short you won't be able to
recognize your own self
'In the hospital, when
I regained consciousness...'
'...the facts that stared back at me'
'Even if I want to, I cannot
go back to my old life'
'My dream for 24 years to be
a cop also came to a full stop'
'I was forced to live
half my 20s asleep'
'I was mad at the doctors
for saving me'
'But above all...'
'...I couldn't believe
or digest the News'
'From the time I heard that
I don't know why'
'Within me I had this'
'That's why I started looking for answers
as to why the case was still open'
'The one you respected
and encouraged'
Honestly it feels like
I'm talking to a new person
Whatever you asked me now,
you could've asked me directly, Gautham
I wonder what mistake I committed
for you to point a gun at me
I came 10 days ago
to ask you directly
'I had seen the same face
5 years ago in a white Dzire'
'What I hold today, I didn't
have on me the other day'
'I would've finished right then
the job I intend today'
I hope you now understand
why I'm pointing this gun at you
He erased 5 years
of my life and my identity
You knew this truth too
And yet, you chose
not to take any action
I'm not such a bad person to hold you
at gun point without any reason and talk
You are not that good a person to
let a criminal escape and save him
I believe I'll get it
What I'm doing now
may seem wrong to others
But I feel this is
the only right answer
I've come with a decision
Without any change whatsoever
You have to come out
with the truth
You have no other choice
Tell me, sir
Tell me, sir
'This is your last warning
Don't point the gun at him'
Rajeev is my son!
'The fact that I have a girlfriend'
'And the reason I am
in Coimbatore now'
'My dad isn't aware of either'
'I lost my mom when
I was very young'
'This will come as a complete
surprise for you, dad'
"Wounds that leave scars behind"
"Undying moments borne in the mind"
"In the atrium of the heart, deep inside"
"Ablaze burning in every side"
"I gently rest in a peaceful state"
"As smoke I evaporate"
"In search of death’s lap
I seek an eternal nap"
"A blank sheet of paper"
"I turn into forever"
"Death has redrafted my fate clearly"
'After a while, knock on
your neighbor's door'
'Tell him Shruti is missing'
"Absolved of blame I resurrect slightly"
"When about to be snuffed totally
I glow as a light brightly"
"I gently rest to evolve"
"As smoke I dissolve"
"In search of sleep eternal
I recline on a lap unconditional"
'Someone was waiting in front
of your house for a long time'
'Who?'
'Must be around 6:00 p.m'
'I saw him when I was getting
back home from my walk'
'I don't know where
he went after that'
'Come to the airport
after 10:00 p.m'
'Both of you stay in Nasik
till I let you know it's safe'
'A stranger just tossed something
from his car into a pond, sir'
'Explain clearly'
'He opened his car trunk and flung
something huge into the pond, sir'
'What vehicle, sir?'
"That scent of death unpredictable
A moment of poignant poetry indelible"
'A personal scar in my son's life'
He can't erase it
even if he wants to'
'That's why he decided
to cover it up'
"With the purest last breath
I design my own death"
'Didn't I tell you
in the beginning?'
'Karma is a boomerang'
'However far you may hurl it...'
'...it will bounce back to us'
'Maybe if I had narrated my story
from Gautham's point of view...'
'...I would have been the villain'
'But did you notice something?'
'The reason my
life ended like this...'
'...is because of the decisions
I took at an emotional peak'
'In case...'
'...Shruti hadn't insulted Krish
in a moment of sheer hatred'
'In red hot rage, if Krish hadn't
commited that inhuman act'
'In a state of panic if Rajeev
hadn't murdered Krish'
'If I hadn't hidden all this truth
due to parental love and affection...!'
'Finally if Gautham hadn't shot me
for the sake of pure justice...'
'...life would have been
so different, right?'
