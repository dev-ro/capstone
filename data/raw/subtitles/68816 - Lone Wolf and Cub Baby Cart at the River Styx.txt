How cute!
Daigoro.
Are you staying the night?
Thank you for choosing us.
Any other bags?
I will take this around back.
Please come in.
Please come upstairs.
You must be tired.
Let's wash your feet, young man.
O-Matsu.
Yes?
Idiot! Choose the customers better
before you call them in.
Why put up a ronin beggar with a child?
We have empty rooms in the back.
I don't care if we have vacancies or not.
We're a first-class inn
with a distinguished history
with noble samurai customers.
What if he dodges his bill
or gets unruly and waves his sword about?
Welcome. Please come in.
We have rooms for you.
Please stay with us.
- We have a hot bath for you.

I'm very sorry, sir, but unfortunately...
- Head clerk.
- Yes?
Keep this for me.
A fortune!
That's 500 ryo.
Yes, sir! I'll keep it for you, sir!
O-Matsu, what are you waiting for?
Wash the feet of the young master.
Thank you. Oh, you're useless.
What an adorable young master!
Let me wipe your splendid feet.
We'll stay.
One.
Two.
Three.
Five.
Daigoro, you missed one.
One. Two. Three.
Oh, four!
Three.
Four.
Five.
Can I get out now?
I am Ozunu, the head ninja
of the Kurokuwa clan.
I'm Sayaka of the Akashi-Yagyu.
Lord Retsudo of the Ura-Yagyu in Edo
has an order for you.
I am here to deliver his message.
Clear the room, please.
No need! They're all sword mistresses
of the Yagyu clan in Akashi.
So then...
What?
Cursed be Itto Ogami!
The duel resulted in Itto Ogami's victory.
Because of the promise made at the time,
the Yagyu men in Edo cannot touch him.
Thus,
Lady Sayaka, you shall lead
your Akashi-Yagyu sword mistresses
and make sure to defeat Itto Ogami.
Such is the order of Lord Retsudo.
We will defeat him!
Please remember never to be careless.
Your target used to be
the Shogunate Executioner.
He is matchless when he wields
his Suio-ryu Zanbato Horse-Slayer.
Quite a swordsman.
Ozunu, are you trying to insult
the Akashi-Yagyu sword mistresses?
Of course not.
However, as he is formidable enough
to defeat Lord Bizen and Master Kurando,
just in case of the unthinkable,
we the Kurokuwa clan will...
Just in case?
Are these your men?
Yes.
Call the most skilled one.
Junai.
Try to escape to the garden.
What?
Go out to the garden.
We are ninja. It would take only one leap.
Show me if you can.
An amateur! Called himself a ninja?
Tell me where Itto Ogami is.
He will enter Akashi Territory
the day after tomorrow.
Those who wish to hire Itto Ogami -
Lone Wolf and Cub - for an assassination
put up Demon Way talismans
on temples and shrines on major routes.
When Itto sees these talismans,
he will build cairns
to indicate his whereabouts.
Cairns as in Dokan Ota's military tactics?
By following the cairn trail,
the client will find Itto.
House Elder, sir!
A cairn!
This cairn represents a headquarters.
It means he will meet us here.
I am Ichirobei Hirano, the Edo Mansion
Chamberlain of the Awa Domain.
Assassin Lone Wolf and Cub.
Not that I doubt you,
but can you show me proof
you really are Lone Wolf and Cub?
This doesn't concern you.
Did that answer your question?
I hate to bother you, but...
Yes, sir.
500 ryo for an assassination.
Bring it.
Please count it.
I ask you to tell me
all the secrets and reasons.
Our Awa Domain officially has
an annual tribute of 257,000 koku,
but actually we are much more prosperous
with a real income of almost 450, 000.
This is because we have a special product,
a dye called Awa Indigo,
and we maintain a monopoly on it.
The annual income from it is 330,000 ryo,
which equals 200,000 koku,
a huge source of income for us.
Naturally our domain is afraid
that the knowledge of indigo production
might be smuggled out,
so we have established the Indigo Office
to exercise strict control.
The Shogunate, however,
is desperate to rebuild its finances
and has set its sight
on our Awa Indigo profits.
So they sent their Oniwaban spies
into our domain
and incited our indigo artisans
to demand better work conditions
and wage increases
in a scheme to start an uprising.
If an uprising occurred,
it would be an excuse
to ban our Awa Indigo sales.
Then the Shogunate would take over
and rob us of our revenue.
This made us desperate.
We hunted down the Oniwaban spies
hiding in our domain
and executed them along with
the ringleaders of the planned uprising.
However,
because the punishment was too harsh,
the head of the indigo artisans
feared for his life.
Thus Chuzaemon Makuya left our domain
and escaped into our neighboring
Takamatsu Territory.
This was our huge blunder.
Takamatsu is a poor domain,
and we have a cat-and-dog relationship.
They were all too eager
to report this to the Shogunate
and provide sanctuary
to Chuzaemon Makuya.
We held negotiations time and time again,
but they insisted
they did not even know him.
Now the situation has escalated
to what we have been most afraid of.
The Shogunate intends to take custody
of Chuzaemon Makuya.
We have a report that they are sending
the Shogunate Escort,
the three brothers - BenTenRai -
to Takamatsu.
You may well know their reputation.
They say even the Yagyu men
raise their hats
to the three Hidari brothers of
Benma, Tenma and Kuruma.
All three are masters of Takenouchi-ryu
Dagger Techniques.
Benma uses iron claws.
Tenma uses flying maces.
Kuruma uses what they call iron fists.
I hear they are extremely skilled
and terrifying.
I also hear
they have killed many, many people.
They are also called the Monks of Death.
If we allow the BenTenRai brothers
to spirit away Chuzaemon Makuya,
the Shogunate will find out
how to produce Awa Indigo.
It can lead to a grave situation,
and our domain may fall.
Please kill Chuzaemon Makuya
and save our Awa Domain.
Please, I beseech you.
BenTenRai are on a seafaring ship,
the Eiraku Maru.
It will come into Akashi Harbor
in two days in the early afternoon.
Please get on board.
The Eiraku Maru will leave the port
at the sound of the sunrise bell.
Standing in the middle
are two butterfly cedars
They fly in together
Side dish tonight is
Radish
Sliced
White in color
Daigoro!
And yet
Even if you fall in love
It won't bear fruit
So jealous
Why is it so?
Sayaka Yagyu at your service.
I'll fight you.
COLD NIGHT PRAYER
Daigoro.
Here we go.
Papa.
One more time.
I must defeat Itto Ogami to uphold
the honor of the Akashi-Yagyu.
He is skilled enough to hold the post
of Shogunate Executioner.
We can't defeat him with ordinary means.
Ozunu,
are you saying Itto Ogami's Suio-ryu
Horse-Slayer surpasses the Yagyu warriors?
With due respect,
each and every one
of your women have been defeated,
and I have only two men left.
We shall kidnap Itto's son, Daigoro.
We belong to the Yagyu clan.
How can we employ a cowardly tactic?
He intends to defeat the Yagyu clan
and wishes to entrust his son
with the revival of the Ogami clan.
If he loses his son,
even Itto would have difficulty
focusing on his sword skills.
“Employ any means necessary
to kill Itto Ogami.”
Such is the order from Lord Retsudo.
Daigoro.
Welcome, Itto Ogami.
Stop.
You play dirty, Yagyu.
What's your plan for my son?
This fight is already settled.
Throw away your Dotanuki sword.
What say you, Itto Ogami?
I refuse.
This well is bottomless.
If I let go of this rope,
this boy will die.
Why don't you kill him if you want to?
But for what?
Have you and your Kurokuwa clan fallen
so low as to serve under the Yagyu clan?
What about yourself, with your wife killed
and you wandering like a stray dog?
My son and I walk the Demon Way in Hell,
so we're not ordinary humans.
We're resolved to descend to Hell
through the Six Realms and Four Lives.
If I am to lose everything here,
I must accept the destiny
of the Demon Way.
Then I shall ask you.
Why did you hurry over here when you
realized your son was in danger?
Isn't it because you have the heart
of a father and hope to save your son?
Who would allow everything
to take its own course?
I shall do my best
and then wait for destiny.
Daigoro.
Your mother should be waiting for you
at the River Styx.
Are you ready?
Papa.
Daigoro.
Yeah? She squeezed you inside?
Yep. She had a really tight entrance.
Papa.
Excuse me! The passengers
who came on board at Akashi,
I'm collecting your fare.
Brother.
Damn thugs hired by the Awa Domain.
Brother!
You saw what happened.
We had to kill them.
We were the victims of their attack.
We will report to the maritime warden
at Takamatsu Kitadomari.
Don't worry about it.
Yes, sir.
Take care of the bodies.
You can throw them into the sea.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
He has a child.
Damn BenTenRai bastards.
I'm not staying with these scary guys.
Move us into your crew's quarters.
Who knows what will happen
if we stay with them.
What if we get involved?
Damn shit.
No way I'll let you assholes
get to Takamatsu.
I, Sanji, accepted this big job
for 200 ryo.
I gotta roast them
or say good-bye to the remaining 100 ryo.
Just wait.
I'm sorry to bother you,
but would you throw back my knife?
HAN STATE SOY SAUCE
AKASHI-YA
It's oil.
Oil disguised as soy sauce.
This must be another attempt
by the Awa Domain.
Lucky for me, they're drinking sake.
They scared me. I thought for a moment
they saw through my plan.
I'll show those bastards.
They're like birds trapped in a cage.
I'll roast them alive.
Fire!
Fire!
We are used to this kind of thing.
You have a child. You can't to anything.
However, if you survive
this one-in-a-million chance,
we'll leave you with these words.
We will enter Takamatsu
and take custody of our charge.
From Hiketa, we'll go through the Oura Dunes
to Kitadomari.
The Shogunate's ship will take us to Edo.
Be sure to stay away from this route.
We are escorts.
We don't bother those who don't attack us.
We show no mercy, however,
to those who interfere.
Remember that.
Even to one who used to be
the Shogunate Executioner.
We've heard about Lone Wolf and Cub.
Not much of an assassin
if he can't escape this.
Run!
Get away!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Somebody!
- Help!
Daigoro!
Hold on for a moment.
How dare you!
Daigoro.
We don't have fire.
We'll all die if we don't warm ourselves.
You mean you want to save me?
You're saving us too.
Three people are warmer than two.
Brother, will the Awa Domain attack us?
Dunes as far as the eye can see.
I don't see any shadow of a person,
and I sense no one.
They'll come for sure.
If this man, Chuzaemon Makuya,
is brought to Edo,
the Awa Domain will suffer a loss
of 200,000 koku in revenue.
They'll sacrifice their lives to take him.
Don't let your guard down.
Kill Makuya!
Kill Chuzaemon!
I knew you'd come.
You escaped the fire. Impressive.
You managed to save your life,
yet you're here to throw it away now?
Here I come.
To think you'd throw your sword...
My neck...
My own neck...
It sounds like it's wailing.
My neck was sliced open diagonally.
The cut wails like a cold winter wind.
They call it mogari-bue,
“the whistle of a fallen tiger.”
I've always wished to kill someone,
just once,
and create such a fine cut
as to sing this tune.
Now I'm hearing it from my own neck.
What a laugh.
Come on!
Come out.
Assassin Lone Wolf and Cub.
At your service.
THE END
