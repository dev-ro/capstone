Yo, max.
# Welcome to Jamrock #
Damien Marley
Welcome to Jamrock,
camp where the thugs they camp at
Two pounds a weed inna van bag
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack,
it inna your back pack
The smell a give your girlfriend contact
Some boy noy notice,
them only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories,
and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And they don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals a now back too,
the thugs they have do what them got to
And won't think twice to shoot you
Don't make them spot you,
unless you carry guns a lot too
A pure tuff things come at you
When Trenchtown man stop
laugh and block-off traffic
Then them wheel and pop off
and them start clap it
With the pin file dung and it a beat drop it
Police come inna jeep and them cant stop it
Some say them a playboy (them)
a playboy rabbit
...a get dropped like a bad habit
So nobody pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone!
- Welcome to Jamrock!
- Out in the streets, they call it murder!
Welcome to Jamrock,
poor people are dead at random
Political violence, can done!
Pure ghost and phantom,
the youth theem get blind by stardom
Now the Kings Of Kings a call
Old man to Pickney,
so wave one hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sicken me...
The policeman is dead!
Biggs shot Jakes!
Jakes, are you dead?
Damn! They shot the man.
Jakes, are you dead?
Informer (Snitch). Die!
Wait for me.
I shot the snitch.
What's going on, Sando?
How's it going, kids?
What's that gun for?
Did y'all go to school today?
We'll go to school tomorrow.
Make sure y'all do.
Make sure.
Man, we ain't going to school.
We wanna be just like you, Sando.
Stop wasting time with the kids.
- Go do what we came here for.
- Later.
I wonder how much money
he has on him.
- Who are you talking about?
- The truck driver.
I don't know.
Come. Let's go find out.
- What's up, boss?
- Need any help?
This work is too hard for you, kid.
This is a grown man's work.
I can do grown man's work too.
I like your determination.
How much money is that, boss?
We've never seen
so much money before.
You'll soon make a lot of money.
I know, but just tell me anyway.
How much money
do you make in a day?
My friend says about 5000.
I tell him, not that much.
Your friend is wrong.
I told you.
But you're wrong too.
Try 100,000.
You must have a gun to protect
all that money. Right, boss?
I don't need any gun, kid.
I'm not afraid of anything or anyone.
We need a gun.
That's a lot of money.
I know where a gun is.
- Where? Tell me.
- Over at rasta neville's yard.
I saw it the other day
when I was playing with his son, Fire.
Where does he keep it?
Relax, man. I'll get it.
Who's there?
It's me, Wayne.
You're too early to buy ganja.
Whoever sent you, let them know...
...I don't sell weed this early.
I'm not here to buy weed.
So, what do you want?
I've come to play with Fire.
Right now, Fire is sleeping.
Come back later when he's awake.
All right.
All right, my lord.
- Morning, Ms. pauline.
- Morning, Wayne.
- Is Biggs awake?
- That damn lazy boy.
Errol! Your friend is here.
Go get him.
Morning, auntie.
Trouble.
Hurry up and put your shirt on.
I have something to show you.
Today we're rich!
Errol?
Errol?
Errol?
Yes, auntie.
Come and go to the store for me.
All right, I'm coming.
Here, take this.
Buy two cans of sardines
and a loaf of bread.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm tired of eating sardines.
So go back to America to your mama
where you can eat steak.
Trouble.
Biggs, why did your mother
send you back to Jamaica?
She claimed I'm bad.
Wayne, you don't think
I'm bad, do you?
No, man. You're cool.
Ready?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Kid, be careful.
What are you doing?
Did you hurt yourself?
Are you all right?
Give me the money.
Boy, put that thing away.
You could hurt somebody.
We want the fucking money.
Where's the rest of the money?
All right!
Take the money, don't kill me.
Jesuschrist!
It's in the truck, under the seat.
- Wayne, go get it.
- Under the seat.
Jesus christ.
Fucking little thieves.
Wayne, check the window.
Wayne, check the window.
Wayne, what are you gonna
do with your money?
I don't know.
Give it to my mother.
I'm giving some of my money
to Sando.
He has a visa connection.
I'm gonna buy a visa.
I'm going to buy a visa too, then.
Do you have family in America?
My father, but I don't know him.
Well, my mother's in Miami.
I'm gonna tell my auntie
I have the money...
...so she can send me to America.
A boy like me
must go back to America.
I wanna go to America too.
I'll ask my mom
if you can stay with us.
Attention, please.
Flight 33 from Miami has just arrived.
Sit down, boy.
Sit down.
Inspector, take care of this for me.
I have some work to do.
Make sure you bring back
something for me.
That depends on what I get.
All right. Cool, cool.
Errol williams.
Where are you from?
Where are you from?
America.
America.
Boy...
...Where in Jamaica were you born?
Kingston Public Hospital.
Wise-ass, huh?
You're one of those guys who were
in America committing crimes...
...then come back here
to wreck the island...
...with your
american-style carjacking...
...extortion...
...and all types of fuckry!
Well, I'm here for y'all.
You hear me?
Slip, and I'll be all over your ass.
Constable.
Yes.
Fingerprint this boy for me.
Yes, sir.
Stand up.
Welcome home, dog.
- What's up, nigga? How you living?
- How we living? That's how we living.
Biggs, you remember
Mad Max, right?
Of course, I remember Max.
- What's up, killer?
- Greetings, King.
Mad Max is the number one
shotta (gangster) in Jamaica right now.
Respect.
Let's go pick up John John.
Blacka, don't come any farther.
What are you doing, Max?
Bringing a knife to a gunfight?
You taught me never to do that.
The boys are out on the balcony.
Fucking awesome view.
Nice. Relaxing, you know.
Don't move.
Fuck! Wayne, who is this?
It's my little brother, Blacka.
- Blacka, what's going on, brother?
- I'm chilling.
Last time I saw you, kid...
...you were still pissing your bed.
The boy's all grown up now.
Big boy.
Listen, I hope
you're not a gangster too.
You know that runs in the blood.
You've really grown up.
Can't be a baby forever.
In some selfish and crazy way...
...I wish you would.
Don't worry yourself, Biggs.
Everything is cool.
You know your brother
is like my own brother, right?
I know.
He takes care of me.
You have nothing to worry about.
Yo, see y'all later.
Cool, man.
He's all right, man.
He's a good kid.
He's all right.
I'm watching out for him.
You know,
we are creating monsters.
Let me get you a girl.
Look around you.
See those guys...
...they're dangerous.
They'll do anything for us.
Anytime. Anywhere. To anyone.
Yeah, those guys are hungry...
...especially Max.
Now, you must help me
feed those guys.
Talk to me.
Anything I have is yours.
My house is yours,
my bitch is yours...
...but not my wife.
You showed me the game.
You know the fellas have to eat.
If they don't, they'll turn around
and eat our food.
I don't know Jamaica like that.
And I don't know these cats like that.
See what l'm saying?
It's been 20 years since I've been back
to this motherfucker, yo.
I'm out of my comfort zone.
Jamaica is a cakewalk.
I saw you lock down Miami.
What happened to you?
Fuck jamaica.
We have the manpower...
...and the guns too.
I had millions of dollars
in America...
...before I went to prison.
I lived the best life
there was to live...
...and I want it back.
And little jamaica
can't do that for me.
You don't understand.
Did you see all those houses
we drove past on the way up here?
All the people, shops and stores...
...they give me a little something
to live comfortably.
A little something, huh?
Protection.
You know, we're more effective
than the police.
- Sounds like extortion.
- So you call it.
Nigga, that's what it is.
What the fuck you talking about?
I call it capitalism.
Around here,
they understand the program.
They kicked us out of America.
This is where we are now.
What are we gonna do,
lay down...
...so people can call us
worthless deportee boys?
I don't even like that word,
"deportee".
If a motherfucker calls me a deportee,
I'll empty my gun in his fucking face.
Yeah. Definitely.
It's been 4 years
since I got deported.
I came back home just like you,
with nothing.
But I realized I had to
step up the game.
Yeah. For real.
Take america out of your mind.
Right now, we have
everything here in Jamaica.
Even politicians are in our pockets.
Hello, baby.
Hello.
Let me talk to the big man.
- Like your hair.
- Hello, Mr. Chin?
OK, sir. There's some men
at the front.
- He'll be with you. He's coming, okay?
- All right.
What's up, Mr. Chin?
Are you ready for me?
l told you, man, one more week.
Me no have it yet.
Come back and see me.
You think I have time to waste?
- Trying to beat the system, Mr. Chin?
- No, not at all.
But you and I have an agreement.
Yeah, and you're not keeping
your end of the bargain.
So, Max, do him.
Is this how y'all living?
Man, fuck the chinese boy.
He hasn't paid for 3 months.
What does he think this is, a game?
No, motherfucker.
This is the real thing.
Yo, I'm just saying though,
what the fuck was that?
Where you from?
Miami.
Where in Miami are you from?
You ask too many questions.
He's the big man.
He runs Miami.
Just take care of him.
I'll be back. I'm going to the bathroom.
Order more champagne.
Faggot, remember me?
Remember you from where?
I don't know you.
Shoot the motherfucker.
- Die. You're gonna die.
- Shoot the motherfucker.
- Get off the bike!
- Police!
Motherfuckers must die!
Big move.
Big move for who?
Checkmate in two more turns.
- Hello.
- A full four more.
How you learn to play this game?
Say what?
Not a talking game,
it's a killing game.
Who called?
Mad Max.
He said....
He said they just killed Blacka.
Who just killed my little brother?
He said Laing and his friends.
That police boy, Laing, he must die!
Hello.
Let me speak to Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson,
Wayne is on the phone for you.
Wayne, what's happening?
How is everything?
Not so good, sir.
What happened now, Wayne?
Your boys getting out of control?
The only person
out of control is Laing.
Laing is an officer of the law.
And if your boys won't listen,
there is very little I can do.
But he knew that was my little brother.
He didn't have to kill him.
The chinese businesspeople knew
Blacka and Mad Max were behind...
...their colleague's murder.
- They didn't have to kill him.
When things get like that,
it's out of my hands.
Wayne...
...you need to come to my office
and see me.
Blacka threw his life away.
Blacka knew what was going on.
He should have been
right here with us.
Too much showing off, dog.
I hear you, Biggs.
But Laing has wanted to kill someone
in my crew for a long time.
He never liked me!
Gangster, don't you see
that's natural...
...police and thieves.
The politician, Mr. Anderson,
wants me to come see him.
Let me tell you something.
Police, politicians...
...I don't trust none of them!
Remember.
I'm still gonna listen
to what he has to say.
Mr. Anderson, Mr. Anderson.
Wayne.
How you doing, friend?
Have a seat, gentlemen.
Mr. Andy, this is my friend Biggs.
You already know John John.
So, what can I do
to cool things down?
I don't want you and officer Laing
going at it, you know.
It's him. He needs to chill.
He needs to back off.
He knew Blacka was my little brother.
He didn't have to kill him.
Listen to yourself.
I'm really sorry about your brother...
...but he was like a mad dog
running wild.
Mr. Andy, that was my little brother.
Furthermore, Laing wants
to stop our livelihood...
...and that's not gonna happen.
Wayne, election is coming up...
...and I cannot afford to have
any unnecessary wrongs...
...in my constituency.
You're going to have to
work with me, Wayne.
So, what do you want me
to do for you now, sir?
As you know, I have a very good
connection at the embassy.
I need you to leave Jamaica.
I'll get you and your friends
the visa.
And you leave the island
and go cool out for a while.
Because I can't take the heat
that is about to come down on me.
I have a whole community
depending on me.
Mr. Andy, I respect you,
but l'm not leaving Jamaica.
Things are good for me
right now in Jamaica.
Wayne...
...there is nothing else on the table.
Nothing else on the table?
You're telling me that
you can't tell Laing to back off?
You can't tell him to step aside?
Wayne, don't put me in a spot.
Mr. Andy, I feel like
you're not trying to hear me.
You're not trying to
see things my way.
Furthermore, I feel like
you're disrespecting me.
So you know what?
We're leaving.
Wayne.
Wayne.
Wayne.
Detective Laing...
...this is Patrick Anderson, MP.
Not good.
Detective...
...we both have a common problem.
His name is Wayne.
You're familiar with him...
...you killed his brother.
And now it's his turn.
You can find him at Waterhouse,
any time after dark.
And, detective...
...just make sure that this problem
is permanently eradicated.
Police! Police!
Faggot-ass police!
Get Wayne, Max! Get Wayne!
Mr. Laing! Don't kill me!
I'm just a DJ, Mr. Laing!
Don't say my name out of
your fucking dead mouth.
lf it's war they want,
it's war they'll fucking get!
We're gonna show them
who the real gangsters are.
That's not going to benefit us,
Wayne.
We have to leave this alone
or we're gonna end up dead!
Miami is where we need to be...
...to start robbing some of those
bigtime drug dealers.
Gangsters don't rob 9-to-5 people
and poor people. You know that.
America is where we need to be.
Straight.
You know what?
Let me call that bitch-ass politician.
Do that. Let him get us the visas.
Then, if necessary, we'll kill him.
- Yeah.
- Mr. Anderson's office.
Hello, good afternoon.
May I speak to Mr. Anderson, please?
May I ask who's calling?
Tell him it's Detective Laing.
Mr. Andy, it's officer Laing again.
Seven wanted men were killed
by the police in a shootout.
Detective Laing.
I've been watching the news
all day...
...and none of those 7 bodies is
identified as our friend Wayne Smith.
You really fucked up this time,
Mr. anderson, you know that?
You fuck up this time!
Wayne?
Wayne.
Wayne, you know that this is
a big misunderstanding.
We can talk, you know, friend.
We don't have a motherfucking
thing to talk about!
After you and your police friends
tried to kill me last night...
...they murdered 7 of my friends...
...7 men who killed to put you in power!
Now you wanna talk?
The only fucking things talking
will be our guns!
What about that visa thing
I told you about?
That deal still stands, you know.
You have 48 hours.
We want three american visas.
All the necessary information will be
faxed to your office within the hour.
I will personally
take care of it myself.
Don't fuck with me, Mr. Anderson!
We already have people
at your kids' school...
...outside your house,
ready to fuck your wife...
...and outside your office too.
Wayne, you got my word on it.
We're gonna work this out
for the better.
Hello, wayne?
Wayne?
So let her go now, Wayne.
How do they look? Legit?
That's for my little brother Blacka,
you motherfucker.
Throw out the girl.
So, what's the deal, dog?
What's up?
What do y'all want?
Yo, what's up?
Who holding down the spot?
Yo, Gussy.
Fucking rug rats running up
on my goddamn window.
What do you need, homeboy?
What's up, killer? What you got?
Some of everything.
Oh, shit,
the gangsters are back!
Jump in.
Gussy, running a weed spot?
I thought you niggas were in Jamaica,
on a beach, drinking martinis.
What are y'all doing back here?
We're here to reclaim
what's rightfully ours.
Gussy, we here to
take this bitch over.
Boy, Biggs, I don't know how
Teddy Bruckshut will take that news.
Who?
You know Bruckshut Teddy.
Teddy from back in the days.
He owns Miami.
He's the man now.
Niggas like us have to go back
to selling dime bags of weed.
Teddy controls all the weight
in this town.
Yeah? So where can we find him?
June's restaurant.
That's where his gang eats every day.
Yeah. Well, I think we gotta pay
Mr. Bruckshut a visit. What you say?
Yeah.
But before all that, you need to
give us a little something, Gussy.
I know how it goes, gangster.
Biggs, who is this guy?
Max, Max.
- Let him be, Max.
- Max, he's cool, he's cool.
- We're coming to see you again later.
- Take this, Wayne.
- Later, put together a proper package.
- I know how it goes, gangster.
- A proper thing, okay?
- Understood. Understood.
But make sure you have
a proper package for us later.
Whole lot of nice cars.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
I hope that nigga inside.
If Gussy says he's here, he's here.
Gussy knows everything.
All right, watch this.
Y'all chill here.
I'll check it and come back.
Let them know we're back in town.
Playtime is over.
Yeah.
I have 50 kilos in South Beach.
I need you to pick them up later.
- Bring Chico with you.
- I got it.
So am l getting my stuff tonight?
We'll talk about that later, Dangles.
Teddy, I'm tired of you playing me.
I need my shit.
I said we'll talk about that later.
I'm tired of the promises.
It's time for me to get my shit, boss.
Oh, shit.
Look who the fuck is back.
The king of Miami.
At least him once was.
What's going on, big man?
Nobody fucking move!
Put your hands
behind your fucking heads!
Boy, are you an idiot?
Up against the wall!
Don't fuck with me!
What the fuck are you doing, Biggs?
What are you doing?
Got a message for you, bitch.
What message
could you have for me?
Playtime is over.
I'm a gangster!
Fuck you and your playtime talk!
I hear you. I hear you.
So, what do you want from me?
A piece of everything.
- Everything?
- Every fucking thing.
Means if you sell a fucking
kilo of cocaine, half is mine.
Sell a fucking nickel bag of weed,
bitch, same thing.
You're fucking escorting me, Biggs!
The word is "extort", you fucking idiot.
You're a fucking drug dealer, why are
you complaining about extortion?
Say something.
- Fucking say something.
- I hear you.
- You're sure?
- I hear you.
Good. Now tell your fucking goons
to sit the fuck down...
...before we start
squeezing in this bitch.
We don't want these innocent people
getting hurt.
Bitch ass.
Yo, spread the word...
...the top shottas are back,
in full effect!
Dangles, you've been a soldier
for a long time.
We're looking for soldiers.
Link up.
We're looking for soldiers.
Link up.
Hello, who this?
Teddy Bruckshut!
I know you ain't gonna let them niggas
extort you like that, man. Come on.
Shotta? I don't give a fuck if they
shotta or whatever the fuck they are!
I don't give a fuck!
Check me and it's done!
Hello? Hello?
Big man, we heard you got it.
Don't make us search for it.
Give it to us.
What, you're saying they're lying?
Just tell us where it is.
We don't want to have to
beat and torture you.
We don't like beating people,
not even kids.
We wait until they grow up,
then we shoot them.
You got it?
They're lying?
If we find it, you're dead.
Looks like you're ready
to scream, big man.
And we can't afford that right now.
Motherfucker.
What do you have there?
And you said you had nothing.
Come on, big man, you must have
more of this around here.
You found something, Max?
What is this, big man?
Motherfucker!
Big man, you said
there was nothing here.
Why do you lie so fucking much?
Here's what we're gonna do:
Everything we found,
we're gonna keep.
Whatever we didn't find...
...you can keep.
Because we know there's
more stuff here. Understand?
What are you trying to say?
Take the weed and leave the money.
Take the what and leave the what?
You sound like a bitch!
You're better off
shutting the fuck up.
What's wrong with this boy?
Take the weed,
leave the money.
So, what are we going to do
with big man?
We're gonna let big man be.
He's a good boy.
Do the rest yourself.
Ok, sir.
What you want for Christmas?
5 million dollars.
What you gonna do with
$5 million, man?
I'm gonna buy me some clothes,
some shoes...
...some jheri and some women.
Some-- What you gonna do
with women?
What's up, killer?
Ain't nothing.
Yo, watch my son.
- I know how y'all do. What's going on?
- Trying to eat.
- As you said, you know how we do.
- Trying to eat? It looks like you eating.
- Porsche.
- Small thing.
But me and you, we need to talk,
you know.
We don't need to talk about nothing.
Ain't nothing happening.
Something is always happening
for you, man.
Nothing is happening for me.
Like y'all say in Jamaica.
Next time we meet...
...you gotta pay up.
I got nothing for you.
Watch your little rug rat, okay.
Love your daddy, you hear?
- Why isn't that little boy in school?
- He plans to be a dunce like his father.
Yo, is this Raquel?
What's up, girl?
Come on, now. How many niggas
you got calling you?
This is Biggs, I'm outside.
All right. Bitches.
Women. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.
That one looks like a winner.
I'm telling you, that girl's hot.
Plus, she's a fucking flirt.
What's up?
What are you talking about?
That's my partner, Wayne.
Wayne, that's Raquel.
- How you doing?
- Hi, Wayne. I'm fine.
That you are.
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.
What you doing tonight?
Coming to the club with me?
You want me to go to the club?
Of course.
What kind of question is that?
- What time you coming to pick me up?
- Fuck picking you up. Let's go now.
But I'm not even dressed.
See. You always worrying about
the wrong things.
We going to the mall. Shop time.
Hello, gentlemen.
How may I help you?
You're gorgeous...
...for real.
I'm gonna marry you.
You wanna marry me?
Are you looking
for anything special?
Yeah. Let me see that one.
Presidential Rolex.
Diamond-encrusted.
Nice, huh?
Oh, yes, it's a beautiful piece.
What do you say, Wayne?
Elegant. Looks nice.
You're the president now.
Let me see that one.
This is the platinum Cartier Pasha.
Listen, no delay.
We'll take both of them.
- Yeah.
- Don't you wanna know the prices?
Baby, if I gotta ask a price,
that mean I can't afford it.
And I got cash.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean any harm.
I'm offended by that.
It's not that simple.
I said, I'm very sorry.
Yeah, but I'm still offended.
You need to give me your number,
address, social security...
...panty size, everything.
Then I may consider it.
- Let me handle the business first.
- All right.
Pum pum size.
- Hey, boy.
- All right.
Small, medium, large...?
You gotta know.
That'll be $67,000.
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.
- Yeah, I've got it. Don't worry.
I'll be back with your receipts
and your packages.
We don't need a package.
We're gonna wear them.
- Ok.
- Hey, baby.
- That's what l'm talking about!
- You bought the whole mall.
You got a bunch of bags.
What's up?
I know, and I didn't even
get everything I wanted.
You're crazy.
- You ain't get what you want?
- No.
Can I get you guys
something to drink?
Coffee, water, champagne,
whatever?
Where's mine?
Can I get you something?
Dangles, what's the deal?
- I'm here, boss.
- Great fucking party!
Yeah, man.
Teddy runs this city.
No punk is taking it back.
See those men over there?
Bring them a bottle of champagne.
My tab.
We don't give a fuck about those other
guys. Where did they pop up from?
See the big spenders over there?
Those guys are punks!
Cheers, papi!
- What's this?
- Compliments from the man over there.
The gentleman over there.
Yes, Mr. Bruckshut.
Yeah. What? I'm MC Hammer.
What? What?
Yo, let my man go up there
and play this new dub plate, man.
Dangles! Take that!
Tell the DJ to play
that motherfucker, or else....
Gussy Gus. You motherfucker.
Yo, biggs, let your security know
I'm a gangster by blood, not relation.
Gangster forever, Gussy.
Take it easy.
You know.
Word is you're here
to take the city back.
Damn right, you know how we do.
We gotta eat.
- Yeah.
- Fuck it.
So, what's up?
What you got for me?
Some american boys from Opa-locka
bring 50 kilos in every tuesday.
The pickup vehicle is a white Jitney.
The stash is in the floor.
- Every tuesday?
- Every tuesday.
- Every tuesday?
- Yeah, every tuesday.
Did you hear that, Skip?
We're rich, girl.
I'm leaving.
I have a fine girl waiting for me.
Yo, Biggs.
I just wanna eat, dog.
- Look out for your nigga.
- No problem.
- That's what l'm talking about, dog.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Gangster for life.
Fucking snitch.
Yo, Gussy.
Get out of this fucking car!
- Wayne, where is Abbey?
- Man, fuck Abbey.
Make sure he has
a proper package for us.
What's up, big man?
I'm chilling.
You know how it goes.
It's fucked up, what happened
to Gussy the other night.
So who do you think did it?
Don't have a clue.
Gussy was a gangster.
That's why it could have been
anyone who murdered him.
I feel you. I hear you.
So, what you got for me?
Give me that.
That's 30 grand.
Yes, Mr. Bruckshut.
- Same time next week, okay?
- Yeah, man.
I don't trust that fucking
Teddy Bruckshut.
He was nervous as fuck, rude boy.
He should be nervous...
...because we know
he had Gussy killed.
He needs some bullets in his ass.
- What's today?
- Tuesday. Why?
Gussy said the americans in Opa-locka
bring in their drugs every tuesday.
- What do you say we go get it?
- Of course we go get it.
Another working day.
Just another day on the job.
Faggot!
He's cool, man.
He's eating his doughnut.
Oh, fuck. Here it comes.
And he's driving alone.
- This is like taking candy from a baby.
- Yeah, the baby better behave.
Police! Don't move! On the ground!
I'm taking this.
Get the car.
What's going on, homey?
What's going on, Wayne?
- What the fuck do you see going on?
- Why are you carrying on like that?
- What's going on, Biggs?
- I'm here.
For a long time I've wanted
to hook up with you guys.
I love the way y'all roll.
Like some original gangsters.
What do you have to give us
on Teddy Bruckshut?
That pussy!
He ain't treating me right.
I'm still riding a motorcycle,
after all the people I've killed for him!
But listen, this Friday,
he's sending $200,000 to Jamaica.
His girl is giving it to some guy
who's taking it to Jamaica for him.
Oh, fuck!
There are those punks.
What do you say?
Wanna finish them now?
What's up, big men?
Seems like y'all own
a car dealership.
No, man. That's you guys.
You're the one rolling
with the rich kid.
Anyway, I'm just saying hello.
It's your world. Later.
And you have to pay to live in it.
- Take it easy, Mr. Bruckshut.
- Yes, pussy. Yes, Mr. Fuck face.
Y'all think he saw me?
Don't worry about anything.
Once you're a gangster,
you're a gangster forever.
I'm gonna call you guys
when the money is leaving.
Yeah.
- Blessings.
- Yeah.
- Later.
- Cool. Do that, do that.
Just do what you're supposed to do,
then come back home.
Dangles, Richie's coming
to pick you up.
I need you to make a run with him.
So who's gonna escort Marcia
and the money?
Don't worry about Marcia.
She knows how to handle herself.
Give me that.
Papi, take this.
Dangles, I don't like the way
you're behaving.
Bitch-ass dread, go fuck your mother.
You don't know me.
What the fuck is wrong
with that guy?
Biggs. Dangles.
Teddy Bruckshut's girl
is on her way.
She's driving a red hummer.
- Respect.
- Bless.
What happened to you, boy?
Easy with my guitar.
Like you jamaicans say,
you wanna die?
It's gonna make me a whole lot of
money, trust me, one of these days.
Kid, you're not gonna make it
in the music business...
...and that guitar
definitely ain't gonna make it.
Listen, they told Jimmy Cliff
the same thing.
You saw what happened.
Why you so uptight for?
Don't worry about that. Drive.
Dangles set us up.
Watch that boy.
I got the other one.
What happened, gangster?
What happened?
Why the fuck are y'all following me?
What happened?
For 10 fucking minutes,
y'all been on my fucking tail.
Why the fuck are y'all following me?
No one is following you.
You're just fucking paranoid.
Fucking right I'm paranoid...
...because you motherfuckers
are following me!
Are you done?
Go suck your mother! We're not
following you, we're protecting you.
Go protect your mother's
sour pussy!
You can't protect yourself.
And you're our investment.
Go protect your mother.
Pussy!
Another hard day at the office.
I'm gonna murder
those motherfuckers!
They think they're gangsters.
I'm gonna murder
every last fucking one of them.
You should kill those motherfuckers.
Fucking banana boats.
Don't you ever say anything
about banana boats.
Never, ever say that again.
I'm gonna get you untight. I'll tell you a
joke. You wanna hear one of my jokes?
I'll tell you anyway, motherfucker.
So listen, right, it was this white man,
black man and chinese man, right?
And one day the king invited them
in his backyard and he was like:
"Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
Whoever could swim past
this swimming pool...
...I'll give my daughter to you."
there was one goddamn problem:
Motherfucker had 20 sharks
in his swimming pool, right?
But you know the chinaman. The
chinaman not fear no fucking thing.
Shark looked at that chinese
motherfucker and ate him up, man.
So then the white boy
jumped in next.
You know white people,
they always trying to reason.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Yeah, hello?
Forget about the white boy, right?
So the black man was in front...
...of the swimming pool.
Next thing you know:
And now the black man's
on the other side like this:
So the king come over
and the king's like:
"What is it that you want, my son?
I'll give you anything."
The black man look at the king
and he said:
I want that motherfucker that threw me
in the motherfucking pool!
Where the big man at?
Richie, I've been waiting.
What happened?
I took care of it. It's done, man.
That's why I put my trust in you.
I love you, rude boy!
You know all that love
you show me?
Want me to show you
the same love back?
Show me.
Take your clothes off.
- Later.
- Where are you going?
Make some runs. I'll be back.
All right?
I'm about to take a shower.
That motherfucker Biggs.
I want him dead.
I want every fucking thing
around him dead.
Every fucking thing!
First thing in the morning,
murder those motherfuckers!
They have 90 seconds
to go in and out.
If they don't get it done
in 90 seconds...
...kill every fucking one of them.
What's going on?
What's really going on?
Just touching base.
I think we need to kick back a little.
Kick back? I don't understand.
We need to cool out.
We have enough money to relax.
I think the air conditioning is set
too high. You're getting cold feet.
I never get cold feet.
Lately, I've been getting a vibe.
We need to stop robbing.
But I just got some information
about a rasta man...
...in Fort Lauderdale.
Heard he has a lot of marijuana.
Leave that alone.
Listen to me, Wayne.
Raquel and I are taking a trip to L.A.
I think both of you should come with us.
Why are you going to L.A.?
You wanna be a movie star?
I'm buying a house out there.
It's a nice place.
Plus, it's far away from
all the madness going on around here.
You're serious?
Of course I'm serious.
So are you guys coming?
No, dog.
What do you say, Max?
Whatever. Nothing matters to me.
The mad one is chilling with me.
Hey, welcome, Max.
And how are you doing, Wayne?
What's up, pretty lady?
Hey, baby.
The gangster's in love.
What are you talking about?
M.O.B., nigga.
Money Over Bitches.
Nigga, you ain't saying shit.
Let me tell you that.
Let's go to the living room.
I'm going to see this girl
in bal harbour.
Do you hear this motherfucker?
M.O.B., nigga.
Money Over Bitches, motherfucker.
Practice what you preach.
I'm gonna get a beer for the road.
All right.
- Hurry up.
- So are you still with the jeweler girl?
23,000 dollars.
A lot of sweat and tears.
You spent
a lot of money to get that ass.
Listen to you. See you later, man.
Cool.
Yo, Max.
Wayne.
Wayne.
Wayne.
Talk to me, Wayne.
Wayne.
My brother for life.
For life.
Motherfucker, breathe
and I'll bust your fucking skull.
Get down on your knees.
Biggs.
Max, are you all right?
Oh, fuck! Wayne!
Motherfucker, don't I know you?
Did Teddy Bruckshut send you?
Motherfucker, you killed my friend.
Where is Teddy?
Where the fuck is Teddy?
All gangsters must die.
Die!
Yeah, but not before you, bitch.
Give me a minute.
Hold the fuck on, man.
Hold on, man.
Hold on, dog. I'm gonna get you
to the hospital. Hold on, man.
Biggs.
What, Max?
Goddamn.
It's fucked up,
what they did to Wayne.
Help, I got an emergency!
Oh, my god. I'll get you some help.
What happened to him?
- What happened?
- I picked him up like this.
Looks like a gunshot wound.
Get him inside, quick.
Do you know him?
No, I just gave him a ride.
I think we lost him.
- Sir?
- Get him!
Sir, let me talk to you for a second.
Sir, I need some more
information on him.
Sir? Sir?
We fucked them up. Motherfuckers.
Nice and hot, baby.
Papi.
Yeah?
Champagne.
Champagne, coming up.
Goddamn, girl.
Papi...
...fucking champagne, huh?
Rude boy, what are you
doing in my yard?
Biggs, you've gone too far now, man.
See what I'm saying?
What do you want from me, rude boy?
Since you got back from Jamaica...
...you've been a pest in my life.
Biggs.
What do you want, money?
I have over $7 million
in the mansion.
Where is it?
In the room next to the staircase.
Come, motherfucker,
let's go get it now.
Don't kill me.
I'll give you everything.
Just don't kill me.
There it is, Biggs.
$7 million is
a whole lot of fucking money.
What else do you want from me?
You killed my girl.
I gave you everything I have.
You have all of my money!
You have everything!
What else do you want from me?
Your soul.
