Ms.Annamma.
- Yes.
Who are you?
I'm Loknath.
Prof. Dasharath Ram sent me.
Well I’m here as a reference
to do a case-study on you.
What do you want from me?
Well, I want to do a case study
by travelling with you.
Well I want to interview you.
Ms. Annamma.
Come on.
[Door opening]
[Rhythmic intensive]
[Music fades slowly]
Are you going to school, dear?
No. It hasn’t started yet.
Also what’s in the school?
I’m gaining a lot of knowledge
from books and newspapers.
Oh, I see.
Yes.
So you don’t need school.
I don’t.
Ms. Annamma.
-Yes.
I should tell you something.
We recently returned from the US
due to the passing of my father.
My daughter doesn’t
know Telugu at all.
[Tense music builds]
[Wooden objects crackling]
[Glass objects shatters]
Loknath.
Go outside.
[Music slowly fades out]
[Vehicles speeding on the road]
Ms.Annamma.
What happened inside?
A spirit possessed the girl.
I freed her from it.
Freeing in the sense…
is it to the devil’s side or the God’s side?
Did I say anything wrong, ma’am?
Freeing is always on God's side.
What’s your explanation for
what has happened inside?
The physical world visible
to the eyes is very tiny.
We can figure out
the boundaries of it.
But there are no boundaries
to the inside world.
We can't understand it easily.
You are not getting it, right?
Nope.
- [Chuckles]Hear me out.
To tell you in a way
you can understand…
If we burn, stab or cut it,
we falsely assume
that it is destroyed.
But we can never destroy the
internal energy and power of it ever.
This is an eternal truth.
After I came out,
what actually happened inside?
[Intense music builds]
What’s your name?
I'm asking your name.
[Masked Husky voice]
Why do you want to know, oldie?
I’m asking you again.
What is your name?
Why? You want to marry me?
[Wild Laughter echoes]
Satyanarayana Raju.
[Gasps and groans]
What do you want?
Didn’t you perform the
final rites for your father?
I was unable to
come back from the US.
Hold his feet and
apologise to your father.
Please forgive me, father.
I couldn’t come as
I didn’t find any flights.
I was unable to repay you.
Bring something
that your father likes.

Indebtedness…
In...
You, who have a great idea
of indebtedness…
You, who have a great idea
of indebtedness…
What’s the reason you entered
this tantric world?
What are your roots...
what do you believe and
what do you want?
[Omnious music]
Our country worships
women as a Goddess.
But many communities
do terrible things to her.
History is getting
wet with her blood.
My father was a spiritualist,
a humanitarian and a wizard.
When he was performing an exorcism,
his precious younger daughter,
that is my younger sister, we lost her.
My mom passed away with that grief.
Yet, he continued his fight.
While fighting with evil,
he lost his life, too.
Before he passed away, he took a promise
from me that I should continue his legacy.
I'm pursuing the things he stopped.
With my tantric knowledge,
it’s enough if I can protect this
world to some extent.
It’s enough if I can stop the bloodshed
happening to women to some extent.
[ominous music stops ]
[Candle flames crackle]
[Pages rustle and book shuts]
[Footsteps]
[Water glugging]
What do you want?
Do they respond
and talk back to you?
If you put your mind,
concentrate, believe,
and talk to any living being
anywhere in this world,
it will talk back to you.
- Oh.
Well...
Do you believe in science?
I do follow it.
If it helps a person in danger,
not only science,
I am ready to follow any religion
or any belief in any community.
I guess you are the only
demonologist in India.
I mean, there’s nobody like you who
went abroad and studied it with interest.
We can talk about me later.
Why are you interested in this?
Why are you doing a case-study on me?
What do you want to do?
I want to become like you, ma’am.
Just like you.
[Chuckles]I was just kidding.
I believe in ghosts.
I want to see how you tackle them
and I’m curious to know how they respond.
That’s all.
Earlier when you saw that girl,
you were lost in thoughts.
Why?
When you saw her, were you
reminded of any previous cases?
There’s nothing like that.
I was just confused thinking which
type of ghost possessed her.
I have no other thoughts
beside saving her.
Was there any highly complicated
case in your career?
Highly complicated case?
Why do you ask?
Well, did you think that
you couldn’t solve it?
There is.
It is very special.
I can never forget it.
I never heard about
such a thing again ever.
That's the story of a soul
with extreme powers.
It’s the story of a soul which never
got the chance to be born into this world.
In the year 1990...
It’s the story happened
in a christian family.
[Suspenseful music intesifies]
[Music fades with a metal bang]
Even if the house is old,
it’s in a good condition, Mr.Antony.
What do you do by the way?
There’s a rice mill in the neighbouring village.
- Oh.
I’m an accountant there.
Then, this house
suits you perfectly, sir.
My mom lives with us.
Somebody told her that if we live in
a north-east facing house we’ll have a boy.
I see.
Take a look, sir.
We already had two daughters.
But my mom wants a boy.
[Man Chuckles]
My mom believes that if a boy is born,
my father will reincarnate.
This way.
What is this?
Why is this door locked?
Even I don’t know, sir.
I’ll check it for you.
[Pleasant music plays]
[Vehicle approaching]
'Nayudamma Residency.'
-Take this off.
-Okay, sir.
[Gate creaks open]
[Girls chuckles]
The house is very huge.
You haven’t seen the insides yet.
You can say that once you are in.
'Nayudamma Residency.'
[Eerie music]
Thank goodness.
The house looks great.
- Yes, mom.
By the way, how did we get
such a big house in our budget?
The bank was selling it in a hurry.
- I see.
We are fortunate.
By the way, who
lived here in the past?
Oh no. How do I know, mom?
[Smiles]
Put those boxes upstairs.
- Okay, sir.
[Kids smiling and running]
Sophie. -Put that there.
- Okay, sir. - Yes.
Call Tara.
[Sophie claps]
Sophie.
- Yes.
Why are you doing that?
How many times should I tell you?
She’s your sister. Remember that.
I didn’t do it deliberately, mom.
I just forgot.
Tara. [Loud strike]
Mom is calling you.
Hmm.
[Kids laughs]
Bring that TV here.
- Okay, sir.
Come fast.
Do you like the house?
The house looks great.
There’s a lot of
space outside to play.
There’s a special room for you both.
Go and take a look.
[Sighs]
[Pulling the nail out]
[Door opening]
Get in, sir.
- Okay.
You are very lucky, Mr.Antony.
There’s a lot of old furniture and
things in this room, it seems.
That must be why they locked it.
This guy will help you with any
repairs in the house, sir.
I see.
Where do you stay?
I stay nearby, sir.
Call me if you need anything.
I’ll come in immediately.
Do you want me to
arrange the things, sir?
Well..
You are talking too much,
go and resume your work.
I’ll get going, sir,
- Okay.
[Pleasant music plays]
[Harmonium produces sound]
[Antony Chuckles]
[Plays Tabla]
Hey! Put it carefully.
Gently. Gently.
Okay, sir.
Hmm.
Arrange all the things
carefully before you leave.

What do you say, Mary?
[Sighs]
[Kid laughing]
Tara, sit with your sister.
Go.
Antony, this time you'll have a boy.
I was saying the
same to Mary earlier.
Mom, did you start
your nagging again?
Where was I nagging?
That you should be fine and that you should
have a boy, I prayed at a church in Medak.
Fine, mom. Okay.
Hmm? You told me already.
- Yes.
Oh Lord, thank you.
Thanks for the meal
we have prepared.

[Machine beeps]
Do you have any doubts?
The baby is healthy.
Doctor, would we know if the baby
is a boy or girl in that image?
We can't tell you even if we know.
That's a crime.
Don't you know that you
shouldn't ask us about that?
We are sorry, doctor.
She asked you in a hurry.
If you can prescribe some medicines.
I'll prescribe some for strength.
You know they won't tell us.
Why did you ask them?
Because I couldn't tolerate
your mom's nagging.
She always says
that she wants a boy.
Oh no!
She nags a lot.
She tells a hundred times that
your father will be born again.
How would I feel?
Tell me.
[Frying sounds]
[Laughs]
[Scooter engine revving]
[Slow music]
What did the doctor say, dear?
Doctor checked with a machine.
Everything is fine, it seems.
She said the baby is healthy.
It's not a machine.
Say that you got yourself scanned.
What's that?
Mom. That's a new procedure.
They'll check and tell if the baby
in the womb is healthy or not.
Is it a boy this time
or a girl again?
Did they tell you
anything about that?
A boy should be born!
A boy should be born!
You always say that.
Do we need another boy in the house?
You are unable to take care of me properly already.
-Sophie!
Speak appropriately for your age.
Do you get me?
Mom...
they don't have permission from the government
to tell us the baby's gender from scanning.
I'm going to school.
Hey, Sophie.
Should I drop you at the school?
I can go by myself.
Yesterday when I went with mom,
I memorised the roads and all.
[Chair dragging sound]
What is this bruise?
Tara!
[Tara gasps]
What bruises are those?
Where did you get hurt?
I don't know, mom.
I've been telling you for so long.
It'd have been better
if you made her go to school.
She keeps hurting
herself if she stays home.
There’s no suitable
school for her here.
What do you want me to do?
[Metal clattering sounds]
Wait.
[Eerie music]
[Eerie music]
[Wooden frames falling down]
Stand right there.
[Suspence music]
How did all the photo
frames fall at once, dear?
Ouch!
- What happened?
Oh no.
The blood fell on the photo.
What happened?
How did it get erased like that?
This must’ve happened because
your dad is still angry.
Mom, stop with your beliefs.
What’s wrong now?
It got erased because you wiped it.
That is all.
What did I say now? That’s why I
am asking forgiveness from God.
[Sighs]
Everybody will get angry if I talk.
Oh, her nagging.
[Grunts]
Tara. What's wrong with you?
Are you fine?
Yes.
- Fine.
Go and continue your drawing.
I'll be back. Go.
Okay.
How did all the photo
frames fall at once, dear?
That carpenter
must’ve done a poor job.
[Suspence music]
They don’t let me stay at
home in peace for a day.
Damn!
[Slow music]
[Chair dragged on floor]
[Eerie music]
[Eerie music]
Tara. Get down.
What is this mischief?
You want to get hurt again?
I didn’t know that
it was swinging very fast.
Don’t talk.
Come with me.
[Kid crying]
[Door closed and bolted]
[Door thuds]
It’s okay, be seated.
Antony, call everybody,
settle the accounts,
pay them and tell them to leave.
Should I tell them to leave?
Why, sir?
I’ve been having issues with the
income tax department.
They are not letting us go off.
I’ll have to close down
the mill for 6 months.
Sir, what about my job then?
Stay for two more months.
A person should be present to
submit the accounts to the department.
However you should take care
of everything for these two months.
[Eerie music]
[Sighs]
[Grunts]
[Iron shutter rolling]
[Kick starting the scooter]
Damn!
This doesn’t look
like it will start, sir.
If you want, take this
lantern and go by foot.
Do you know any mechanics?
I can help you in the morning.
Do you want me to join you?
No, thanks.
I’ll go by myself.
[Crickets chirpring]
[Foot steps on dry leaves]
[Eerie sound]
Excuse me.
-Yes.
Well…
Hey! What do you want?
I wanted to ask
if you could join me.
Okay, come with me.
Are you not used to this road?
You are walking slowly.
Well...
- Where do you live?
Suklapet.
We moved in recently.
What about you?
- I’m going in that way, too.
Thanks a lot for joining me, sir.
Where are you coming
from at this hour?
I’m an accountant at the rice mill.
It got late today.
My bike broke down.
Oh!
We are here.
[Grunts]
[Foot steps]
Sir.
- Yes.
My house is over there.
[Sighs]
Sir.
Sir.
Where is he?
Sir.
Sir.
Where is he?
My goodness.
[Eerie music]
Mary, open the door.
[Knocking on the door]
Open the door.
[Knocking on the door]
[Knocking on the door]
[Closing the door]
What’s wrong?
Why are you so late?
The bike broke down.
Why are you nervous?
I said it was nothing.
[Metal dishes clanking]
There’s nothing in the house to eat.
[Metal spoon falling on floor]
Wait. I’ll get you some warm milk.
[Gasps]
[Fire on with whoosh]
Here... this belongs to your dad.
Wear it around your neck.
Don’t panic.
That person must’ve left after
talking to you. That is all.
I felt like...
I’ve seen him again
near the well, mom.
That must be your hallucination.
All these are common in a new place.
Please don’t come
alone at nights like this.
Wear that necklace and
sleep peacefully without thinking.

What’s wrong?
Why did you scream?
I’m asking you.
What happened?
What happened, dear?
-Why don’t you talk, Sophie?
Ta.. Ta..
Tara…
[Gasps]
Did you say something
to your sister?
No, mom.
I just woke up after her scream
Why don’t you talk when
we are asking you?
Tara.
Mary, who screamed?
What happened?
Sophie. Tell us,
dear. What happened?
Mom.
Ta… Ta…
Tara...
Tara...
Tara is talking about something
standing beside me.
Sophie, what are you talking about?
How could she talk?
Hey! Don’t say anything to her.
Look how terrified she is.
Mom...
this happened for the second time.
Why didn’t you tell me before?
You are lying.
Sophie.
Mom is asking you.
Tell her.
Dad, I swear.
She did talk.
When I heard murmuring,
I searched every corner.
When I finally saw,
she was talking standing beside me.
Why do you believe
that simply, Antony?
Make the kids have some water
and make them go to bed.
It’s a new place after all.
Mary. Take her.
Sophie.
It’s just your hallucination, dear.
Look at Tara,
she’s terrified looking at you.
How could she possibly talk?
Let’s go.
Sleep tight.
[Eerie music]
Nobody cares about me.
Nobody believes me.
If another boy
takes birth in this house...
they might forget me totally.
[Kid weeping]
[Eerie music]
[Eerie music building]
[Scooter engine sound]
Everything is fine, sir.
Take a look.
You should go on Sunday, too?
I should.
I’m the only one in the mill now.
I’ll come back soon.
Okay.

[Signalling by voice]
[Signalling to go]

Do you know how to play pachees?
I don’t know what pachees is.
I’ll teach you.
Shall we play upstairs?
Wait, let’s ask your
brother’s permission.
[Sighs]
Can we both play with
your sister upstairs?
Okay, dear.
You can do that.
[Suspence music]
[Suspence whooshing]
When did you come?
- I came in the morning, ma’am.
Mr.Antony called me. He ordered
me to fix the doors and windows.
Okay.
[Shells crackling]
1. 2. 3.
Come on, mom.
What are you doing?
Where did you get this from?
- Mom, this game is called pachees.
Do you know how to play it?
[Sighs]
Are you telling me about this game?
By the way, where
did you get this from?
The carpenter’s sister found
this in the store room, it seems.
She taught us.
Where is she now?
She said she’ll be back soon
and went downstairs.
Oh.
Mom, this game is great.
After Sophie goes to school,
shall we both play?
[Smiles]
Okay.
[Window clattering]
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma’am.
Could you please give
these to the girls upstairs?
I'll do that.
There are only three glasses,
you and your sister also have them.
It’s fine.
Okay, ma’am.

[Birds chirping]
-Hey!
-Yes!
Mother...
Mother...
Mom. Were you unable to
sleep well last night, mom?
I felt scared and nervous.
I didn’t sleep properly, Antony.
Hey, prepare some hot tea.
- Okay.
No, thanks.
Mom, everybody was
fired from the rice mill.
They told me to stay for 2 months.
After that it’ll be a little hard.
Fine. Did you search
for an alternate job then?
We bought this house
with all the money we had.
For now, I have two kids.
I don’t think I can raise
a third child.
So, I’m thinking of
going for an abortion, mom.
Hey! Are you crazy?
Don’t you want your dad
to reincarnate in this house?
I’ll raise him with my pension.
You can’t bring up abortion again.
Do you get me?
Be careful!
Why is my mom behaving like this?
I’ve never seen my mom like this.

The kids are not here, either.
Where would he go?
He's not here, either.
Mother. Have you seen your son?
I didn’t. Where did he go?
It's like his voice
Mary!
Where is it coming from?
Oh no. Dear! Dear! Dear!
Is anybody out there?
Please help.
Dear, what happened?
Oh no. How did you fall in it?
- Mary!
Please help us.
[Eerie sound]
[Eerie sound building up]
Have tea.
What did you see there last night?
Why did you got there actually?
I felt like I saw Tara there
and I went.
Tara?
- When I approached,
she's not there.
[Sighs in fear]
I feel that somebody is
observing us in this house.
That suspicion is
becoming stronger everyday.
I don't know why.
Tara.
Hello!
Yes, sir.
I’m getting started, sir. Yes.
What happened, dear?
The income tax officials
have come by as there are
irregularities in the accounts
of the rice mill, it seems.
They are calling me urgently.
I might come late.
Have dinner and sleep.
[Crickets chirping]
What are you doing here
at this hour?
We both are going out to play.
Would you like to join?
I have to do my homework.
You both can go.
[Crickets chirping]
Sophie, Where is Tara?
She’s playing outside.
What?
She’s playing outside at this hour?
She went out with
the carpenter’s sister.
Do you have any sense?
How could you leave them both?
What do I know?
I am busy with my homework.
[Sighs]
[Door opening]
[Door closing]
[Owl squeeking]
[Slow suspence music]
Excuse me.
Yes.
Have you seen two kids over here?
They went that way.

Yes.
A girl is walking alone over there.
Driver.
- Yes.
Stop the car near that girl.
- Okay, ma’am.
[Car door opening]
[Car door closed]
What is your name?
Wait, dear.
Driver, give me the water bottle.
Here, ma’am.
Where is your mom?
My mom is home.
Is it?
Come with me. I’ll take you home.
Kotayya.
Who’s that?
- Kotayya!
Why are you here
at this hour, ma’am?
Where is your sister?
- My sister?
I don’t have any sister, ma’am.
What do you mean?
She came to our house the other day
and played with our kids, right?
The other day when I came,
the kids approached me and..
'Can we both play with
your sister upstairs?'
Again when you gave me the juice…
'There are only three glasses,'
'you and your sister
also have them.'
I didn’t understand
why you said ‘sister’, ma’am.
'He doesn't have a younger sister?
With whom did my daughter go?'
Ma’am! Ma’am!
[Owl squeeking]
Stop the car
-Okay, ma’am.
[Car engine revving]
Tara.
Tara, where did you go?
Do you know how tense I was?
I don’t really know
what has happened.
Upon opening my eyes,
I found myself in a different place.
I’m really grateful
for your help, ma’am.
I told my driver to pull over as
this little girl was walking alone.
Be a little careful.
- Okay.
Are you new to this village?
Yes, ma’am.
Where do you live?
We live in Suklapet, ma’am.
You should go back
with a little girl at this hour.
Also you are pregnant.
Yes.
Come on, I’ll drop you.
Get in, dear.
[Car engine revving]
Careful, dear.
-Okay, ma’am.

Mother.
Somebody is...
There’s somebody over there.
What, mom?
Okay, come. I’m here with you.
Come on. Let’s go and see.
Nothing will happen, Mother.
Don’t panic.
Why are you so scared, mom?
Somebody is crying
in that room.
Crying?
-I heard it.
Fine, let’s go and see, Nothing
will happen, mom. I’m telling you.
There’s nobody there, Mother.
No, no. Don’t.
Don’t go alone.
Why are you this scared, mom?
Sophie! - Somebody is over there.
- Mom.
Come on.
Why are the kids not asleep yet?
Mom, don’t panic.
[Trying hard to open the door]
Oh no!
- Antony!
Mother. Don’t panic.
Mary, get me a candle.
Mary, quick.
Dear, let’s all sleep in the same room.
What are you saying, Mary?
What could possibly be there?
I’m going to go and take a look.
[Door opened]
Dear. Just don’t. Listen to me.
Oh no.
Don't, dear. Come outside. Listen to me.
Antony! Come outside. Antony!
[Chair rattling on the floor]

Come outside. Mother!
[Sighs in fear]
Mary.
-Yes.
Give me the matchbox.
Matchbox.
Don’t, dear.
Please come back.
-Do what I tell you to do.
Give me the matchbox.
Please get back.
- Give it.
Stay outside.
Mother.
[Match stick lighted]
[Sighs in fear]
Who’s that?
- Dear, what’s that? - Antony!
Who’s that?
Dad!
- Antony!
Just come back!
- Dear, come back.
Dear!
Dear!
- Mom!
Antony!
-Dear!
Antony! Antony!
- Mom! The door is locked.
Open the door.
Come out, Antony!
Antony!
Open the door.
Come out, Antony! Don’t.
Antony!
Antony!
He who dwells in the shadow of the Almighty
rests in the shadow of the Almighty!
[Gasping in fear]
Anybody out there?
[Eerie noises]
[Screaming]
[Falling with a thud]
Mr.Antony! Mr.Antony!
Here. We are here.
Ma’am. - Come upstairs.
- I’m coming.
What happened, ma’am?
- He’s in this room.
Mr.Antony! Mr.Antony!
Please open the door, sir.
Please open the door, sir.
Sir, shall we break open the doors?
- Come aside.
[Door opened]
Dear.
- Dad.
Get up, dad.
Antony! Antony!
Open your eyes, dear.
Dad! Dad. Get up,
-Dear!
What happened, dad?
What happened, dear?
Dad!
-What happened, dear?
We felt the house
was good at the start.
Now I feel that there are
some forces in this house.
Our situation is really terrible.
I’m unable to share it with anybody.
As they won’t believe me.
Tell me now. Why did you lock yourself
the whole night in that room?
Do you have any problems?
Why would he lock himself up, sir?
Fine. Think about everything
and report in the police station with all the details.
I’ll take my leave.
Our problems have started
because of this house.
Hey!
Tell me.
After knowing everything about the house,
yet you’ve sold us, right?
You just want your money, right? Damn!
-Antony.
Don’t stop me, mom!
I don’t know what you’ll do.
Before tonight, sell this house for me.
Else, show us a house
in exchange for this.
We’ll move out today itself.
How could I search for
one in this short time, sir?
Why?
Didn’t you sell us this house
overnight? Just like that.
I’ll even touch your feet!
Please.
Have a seat, sir.
[Slow pathos music]
Mr.Antony! I didn’t sell you
this house to harm you, sir.
After seeing your
family and liking it,
I’ve sold you this
as it will suit you.
Since you are saying no,
I'll sell it for you, sir.
However, please
give me some time, sir.
If nothing settles
in the meanwhile,
there’s Ms.Annamma
in this village, sir.
She solves problems like these.
Go and take her
appointment once, sir.
[Suspence music]
[Telephone ringing]
[Telephone ringing]
[Telephone ringing]
[Rain with thunders and lightening]
[Door opened]
Dear, what happened?
Should we have to live in this house
being afraid without peace of mind?
One day the photo frames drop down.
And we see a girl another day.
Now, our Tara is talking.
If we live in this house like this…
[Eerie sounds]
Look. If we still
live in this house,
we don’t know what will happen
and what we will have to see.
I’m scared just to think about it.
We are leaving this house tomorrow.
Where to, dear?
Where could we possibly
go all of a sudden, Antony?
I’ve looked for a tiny house
near the rice mill for rent.
Pack the things.
We are moving early in the morning
Do what I say.
[Thunder and lightening]
[Woman screaming]
Dear!
Mary!Mary!
Mary! What happened?
Take her carefully.
How did she slip like that?
I have no idea.
Mom, take care of kids.
I’ll call you after reaching
the hospital. Quickly!
[Suspence music building]
Don’t cry, babies. Don’t cry.
Doctor.
-There’s a little bleeding.
Let’s scan it for safety.
Okay, doctor.
[Thunder and lightening]
Hello?
Are you Mr.Antony?
- Yes
You got a phone call.
Hello?
What did the doctor say?
Is the baby fine in the womb?
They are testing her.
I am here.
How are the girls, by the way?
I’ll take care of them.
Take care of Mary.
One more thing. When someone called for you,
I told them that you were in the hospital.
Fine, fine.
Bye.
Okay.
[Thunder and lightening]
Thanks.
- Okay, sir.
[Whoosh]
[Thunder and lightening]
[Telephone ringing]
[Telephone ringing]
Hello?
-Antony?
Yes. You are?
I am Annamma.
I heard that you are
trying to meet me.
Yes, Ms.Annamma.
Your number was…
I know everything.
Listen to me carefully.
Your family is in danger.
I’ll be back in two days.
Until then be patient.
Don’t try to move out of the house.
Why do you say that, Ms.Annamma?
We're not good in that house at all.
That’s why we are
thinking of moving out.
You can’t move out!
- Why?
I came there upon my wish.
Now I want to move out with my will.
No one can stop me.
Don’t forget that there are forces
that are stronger than your belief.
We can’t stay in that house.
We are leaving tomorrow morning.
I’ll see who’ll stop us.
You are not getting me.
You can’t leave that house
nor the village.
That house won’t let you go
even if you want to.
Hello?
[Telephone hanged up sound]
[Suspence music]
Sir. Sir.
You got a call.
Hello?
-Dad, why are you not here yet?
Grandma was dead
by the time we woke up.
[Suspence music]
Dad. I am scared.
I don’t understand
what I should do, dad.
When will you be back?
Why don’t you talk, dad?
'You can’t leave that house
nor the village.'
'That house won’t let you go
even if you want to.'
[Suspence whoosh]
[Suspence music]
Death.
Is death really the end?
Can anybody say what
will happen after death?
Cremation is done
differently in each culture.
Are all these to get
rid of our bodies?
Or for us to be safe from the souls?
Ms.Annamma.
They say souls with
unfulfilled wishes stay on earth.
Is that true?
Can those souls really harm us?
[Eerie sounds]
[Eerie whoosh]
[Prayers]
[Whoosh]
[Suspence music]
[Eerie sounds]
[prayer]
[prayer]
Amen!
- Amen!
[Eerie whoosh]
Suramma! Suramma!
Why don’t you speak up?
Why should I talk with you?
Suramma, how did you die?
Suramma, I am talking to you.
Suramma, how did you die?
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my house?
Suramma!
Suramma!
Don’t you want to help
your son and granddaughter?
They are shivering to
death from fear in this house.
Can't you help them?
Suramma!
[Coffin top closed]
I’m angry at the house
which killed Mother, dear.
But, like Ms.Annamma said,
let’s stay in that house.
I’ll stand by your side.
[Chants]
Suramma.
One more thing.
You are going to have a grandson.
You can leave with satisfaction.
Your husband is going to be born.
Do this one last help to your family
and leave with peace.
If everything happens like we wish,
why are we both here?
[Strange voices]
Whose voice is this?
[Strange voices]
I got it that you are not Suramma.
You are the old owner of
this house hanging here.
You are Narasamma,
the mother of a brutal murderer.
[Heavy breeze]
Mary.
Is she Ms.Annamma?
Yes, dear.
That day… Well, the
day Tara went missing,
she’s the one who dropped us home.
[prayer]
Amen!
Amen!
After you kept the photo
along with the coffin,
do you think Suramma’s soul
rested in peace, Ms.Annamma?
[Suspence music]
[Wooden cross moved on the wall]
Here, the gods’ photo
frames drop down, ma’am.
Whose photo is that?
I never saw this photo, ma’am.
That photo must belong
to the previous residents.
Ma’am. Didn’t you put this photo in
the coffin right in front of my eyes?
[Sighs in fear]
How did it come here again?
It means the game has started.
Huh?
Something happened in this house.
But some power is stopping me
from knowing the past.
It’s not letting me see the past.
According to your words,
only one soul is not troubling your family.
There are many powers in this house
that are working against you
Ma’am.
We are so scared.
We are unable to stay
in this house nor leave.
If we still stay here,
living daily is like death.
Still we decided to
not leave this house.
But all my worries
are for my children, ma’am.
If something happens to them,
I can’t bear it.
I can tell you by looking
at your courage and love.
Nothing will happen
to your children.
How are you so sure?
The extreme love you have for
your children will protect them.
Because only a mother’s
love can be near God's love.
Hey!
Are you scared?
I have no fear.
I don’t hear anything.
If I see something scary, I’ll
simply close my eyes. That’s all.
What are these bruises?
When I feel like I
got hurt at times,
I don’t remember where I got them from.
I don’t understand, either.
[Suspence sounds]
[Door opened]
[Lighting up whoosh]
[Dry leaves falling down]
[Kid laughs]
[Kid laughs]
History is the result of the
birth and death of man.
The surrounding nature
encapsulates that history.
The visible trees, rocks and mounds are
like safe deposit lockers for our memories.
Only a few have the
power to open those lockers.
I have that power.
60 years ago, this house was filled
with a happy family with kids.
Gradually
this house turned into hell.
[Stell galss falling on the floor]
All the members in that family
were killed brutally.
That tree was saying the same thing.
After that…
[Coughs]
Ms.Annamma.
Wait. Do you want some water?
[Coughing]
[Wooden chair rattling]
Oh no! Ma’am!
- Ms.Annamma.
Dear, do something.
Wait.
Ms.Annamma.
Dear.
- Dad! - Ouch!
Ms.Annamma.
Mary, stand right there.
Save the children.
Ms.Annamma.
Hey!
Dear.
Dad!
- Dear!
Dear.
Ms.Annamma.
What's happening?
Dad,
Dad,
Sophie.
Ms.Annamma.
Ms.Annamma.
Ms.Annamma.
Ms.Annamma.
[Grunts]
[Coughing]
[Grunting in fear]
[Grunting in fear]
If I don’t go out immediately,
you all will fall in danger
along with me.
That shouldn’t happen.
I need to find a solution quicker.
I’ll step into this house only then.
One more thing.
Careful with your younger daughter.
It’s getting late. I should go
and come back before the new moon day.
[Car door opened]
[Car moving on]
[Car stopping]
[Car door closed]
Why are you here, Loknath?
Your story is not yet finished.
I’m here to know what happened next.
You know everything about me
and my story.
You are doing your own research.
You must know what happened later.
There are many blanks
in your story, ma’am.
I’m missing a lot of information.
I guess they’re not letting out many things
that happened in that house.
Are you deliberately leaving blanks?
Ma’am, even though
you are a strong hindu,
how are you able to follow
different religions equally?
All these look like
Abrahamic religions.
You know a lot of things.
- []Are you testing me?
Abrahamic religions in the sense,
they all worship god Abraham.
Also all these have
a religious symbol.
Ma’am, you keep looking
at the photo on the table.
Your younger sister, right?
She passed away in your
childhood, if I’m not wrong.
[Utensils clanking]
Have it.
-Okay!
Ma’am, you went abroad and learned
about religions and their methods. Why?
Well, do you think the methods
in our country are insufficient?
Nothing like that. Exorcism was
never mentioned in Hinduism.
Being possessed by a
soul here is a trivial thing.
Lighting lamps at home everyday,
reciting mantras,
if we pray to Lord Shiva,
you won’t be in any danger
and no soul can possess you.
It’s more of faith,
dedication and practice.
Looks like you will ask me to
teach you these methods next.
Hmm?
Hmm.
You are my cutie pie, right?
Have it.
I don’t want this
sambar rice everyday.
I’m dying to eat it.
I won't now.
Are you going to eat it or not?
Else, how will you get power?
I don’t want it.
The baby in the womb
should grow stronger, right?
You can have it all.
I want another thing.
I don’t want this.
Shut up and eat.
- I’ll not eat this.
[Utensil flying and falling
on the floor]
Hey!

"The foetus is mighty!"
"The foetus is mighty!"
"The foetus is mighty!"

"Death is not the last stanza.

"In which garden do the flowers burn?"
"In which path do the steps dry up?"
"No vow can be kept."
"Sacrifices cannot be stopped."
"Who praised this
type of situation?"
"Who guards this cloud’s signature?"
"Time is magical!
Life is a great dissolution!"
I felt I saw Tara there and went.
"Death is not the last stanza. Life doesn’t cease."
Tara?
"Death is not the last stanza."
When I approached her...
"Life doesn’t cease."
She's not there.
In this house....
"The foetus is mighty!"
I feel like somebody
is observing us.
"The foetus is mighty!"
My suspicion is
growing strong everyday.
[Chants echoing]
You guys are driving me crazy!
[Songs fades out]
[Thunder and lightening]
[Crickets chirping]
Oh my.
I wonder how the
kids are upstairs.
[Door opened]
[Light flickering]
[Eerie sounds]
[Lightening and thunder]
[Sighing in fear]
Who’s that?
[Lightening and thunder]
Antony is not home
at the right time.
[Lightening and thunder]
Who’s that?
[Eerie sounds]
[Screaming aloud]
[Screaming aloud and falling]
[Whoosh]
Hey! Don’t get inside.
What did I tell you? Hammer wooden
blocks to lock these doors forever.
Do you get me?
-Yes, sir.
Look, make sure that chair also
doesn’t move either.
How could you sit
on it without moving?
Why do you need it?
Just do the thing I tell you.
[Fixing nails with hammer]
Ouch!
It looks...
..very old.
Everything in that
room is useless, sir.
It seemed nice to me.
I got this as your
wife might use it.
There are few other things,
do you wish to see them?
[Iron gate opening]
Greetings, Ms.Annamma.
We were scared
thinking if you’d come.
I gave you my word.
How could I not come?
We were all waiting for you.
My goodness. Since you are here,
we will be calmer.
They are my people.
His name is Arya.
He looks young, but he can
understand a variety of things.
He has high consciousness.
Before we tell him
something particularly,
he’ll sense the need
and do the needful.
His senses work very powerfully.
His name is Sohel. He’s very
strong. He doesn’t know fear.
He’ll sense the upcoming danger
in advance and will get rid of it.
His name is GK.
He is fluent in 16 languages.
Please don’t think of
leaving this house.
You’ll live peacefully
and happily in this house.
I’ll make sure to do that.
I gave you my
word. Trust me.
[Slow music]
Oh Lord!
[Fire burning and suspence sounds]
Ms.Annamma!
Ms.Annamma!
Please come here once.
[Suspence music]
[Shallow base voice humming]
[Eerie music]
Catch it.
[Kid laughing]
[Kid laughing continues]
Ms.Annamma.
- Yes.
Do you want me to
help with something?
No, Antony. Don’t.
Don’t come this way.
Put all your
concentration on the kids.
Don’t lose your focus from the kids.
Okay?
Okay.
[Echoing voice]
Tara, come here once.
[Eerie music]
Tara! Tara!
Sophie. Sophie. Don’t go that way.
Hey! Sophie.
Wait here.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Hey! Sophie!
[sighs in fear]
What’s wrong? Where is Tara?
Where is Tara?
Tara... Tara... Tara...
You know the way home.
Be on your way.
Tara.
What?
Tara.
[Sighs in fear]
Don’t stop her.
Let her circle the tree.
[Suspence music]
[Eerie sounds]
We found this skeleton on that tree.
This looks like that of a kid’s.
Yes, it belongs to a girl.
This is one of the terrible things
that happened in this house a few years ago.
This girl’s father
chased and killed her.
He's a brutal murderer. With extreme fear
the girl came here and hid in the tree alive.
[Crickets chirping]
But poor her. She lost her breath.
Ma’am.
The girl fainted.
I’ll tell you everything
clearly later.
First go and get Tara. Go.
Okay.
[Door opened and foot steps]
Close the main door and windows.
Antony, get the girl here.
Make her sleep here.
Careful.
Arya. Sohel. Start it.
Listen to me carefully.
Now we are here with the blessings
and permission from the creator.
The evil spirits that
are holding the roots of
this house and tormenting
them should be uprooted.
I should save this
house and the family.
We only have time until dawn.
Nobody should sleep or eat.
Nobody should talk if any stranger
tries to start a conversation.
You shouldn’t make
eye contact either.
Everybody is in
danger in this house.
But we won’t fear it nor
will we commit a mistake.
Understand?
Mother of Mothers,
Goddess Durga is together with us.
Her kind gaze is our weapon.
GK.
- Ma’am.
Start your process.
- Okay.

Mom, I might die of hunger.

Nothing will happen to her.
Just wait.
Tara. Dear
- Dad.
Dad.
I am so scared, dad.
You’ll be fine, dear.
- Will I die?
Hold me, daddy.
Come and hold me like
- I am here.
you did back then, dad.
Come on, dad.
[Kid weeping]
Hey!
Are you worried? Are you scared?
You decided to kill
the baby in the womb.
Didn't you feel sad at that time?
Kill me now.
Come on...Come on...
[Evil laugh]
I’ll kill all of you tonight
in this house.
[Evil laugh]

Tara!
Tara!
Ma’am. What’s this?
- Tara!
Mary, wait.
Tara!
Tara!
Tara! Tara! Are you here?
Tara!
Ms.Annamma. Ma’am.
- Yes.
I don’t see Tara.
Please come fast.
- GK. Wake up, GK.
Please come fast, ma’am.
- Arya, let’s go.
Okay, ma’am.
Tara!
Where are you, dear?
Tara is not here, ma’am.
Go downstairs. Take care of Sofy and Mary. Go.
How?
- I’ll get Tara. Just leave.
Look there.
Take that off.
Carefully.
[Grunting]
Watch out. Carefully.
[Eerie sounds and scream]
Arya!
Arya!
Arya! The things you see are not real.
Don’t panic. Get up.
Get up. Careful.
Open this.
[Iron trunk box door opening]
Ma’am. What’s wrong?
The incident that happened
in this house in 1930
is still reverberating
in this house.
The amout of torture she
tolerated is immeasureable.
Ouch!
[Kid laughing]
This is a family which killed humanity with
the madness to have a boy.
[Kids laughing and playing]
Get lost.
- Ouch! Be careful.
Darn it!
Kick this useless woman out now!
It’s all our karma.
Don’t you hear me?
Look, the queen is here.
Look at her.
You can’t do that.
Get out you, jinxed woman!
What are you still watching here?
Hey! I’m telling you
for one last time.
How many girls
will you give birth to?
Don’t you have any shame?
If you don’t give birth to a
boy this time, you will die!
With the superstition that a
girl will be born again like that,
No, Mother...please
Hey! Shut up! Shut up!
Are you going to be quiet or not?
Hold her tightly.
- Don’t be afraid, dear.
Nothing will happen.
- Hold her. Come on. Tightly.
Why are you standing still?
- Don’t be scared. It’ll be done soon.
Don’t be scared. Just lie down.
Shut up.
Shut up.
What?
- Hold her.
She’s telling you, right?
Lie down.
- Lie down.
Tie her up. Come on.
- Please let me go.
Shut up.
Don't hurt me.
- Hey!
Hey, Shut up.
She’ll not stop screaming.
Quick! Quick!
Take it out! Yellamma, come on.
Why are you screaming?
Shut up! Shut the hell up!
I’ll bury you dead
if you make a sound.
Come on.
Why are you screaming?
Shut up! Shut the hell up!
Yellamma, check her.
Shut up! Shut up!
No!
[Woman screaming]
That humanoid animal
killed the unborn foetus.
The screams from back then are still echoing
as cries from the corners of this house.
Hey! Hey!
Not only did that humanoid animal
kill the unborn foetus...
but also chased and killed
all the girls in the house.
No, dad. Please, don't.
Hey!
Don't dad. Please.
[Kid screaming]

Ms.Annamma.
No spell is working
on Tara, Ms.Annamma.
Tell me what I should do.
Ms.Annamma.
- Yes.
This soul doesn’t look like
it will leave Tara.
[Classical eerie music on Sitar]
Everybody in this
house got attacked, right?
How were you attacked, Mary?
I… I…
I haven’t got attacked
until now, ma’am.
I get it.
The baby resting in Mary’s womb
is under the protection of the
unborn foetus from 60 years ago.
That unborn foetus gathered
the power of five elements,
got convinced and turned
into a supreme power.
It turned into a protector
for the baby that’ll be born.
The power of it now is no less
than a tsunami or an earthquake.
That is waiting for the baby
Mary will give birth to.
That’s why Mary is safe until now.
The baby in Mary’s womb is
under the protection of that power.
That power is ready to
take over once the baby is born.
That power possessed Tara now.
Let’s start the pooja.
- Mary, come on.
Have a seat.
[Door opened]
Be courageous.
Sophie.
Thinking about the Goddess,
assuming that the dough
shape is a foetus,
drop milk drops on its head
280 times and recite this mantra.
[Recites mantra]
This is that mantra.
This is to count.
Take it. Start reciting.
[Recites mantra]
[Recites mantra]
[Mary recites mantra]
[Mary recites mantra]
The remains we found in
this house belong to the mother
and child who were killed
in this house 60 years ago.
We should cremate them respectfully.
Even if they did harm us,
we should do that.
Only then will nature
cooperate with us.
Antony.
-Ma’am.
That is your duty.
Sohel will help you.
[Mary recites mantra]
I’ll go now and take care of the things
Ms.Annamma said. You take care of this.
Okay.
Antony, Look at me once.
Look into my eyes.
Nobody should talk
if any stranger tries to start a conversation.
You shouldn’t make
eye contact either.
Hey! Look at me!
Look into my eyes!
Hey! Look at me!
[Fire burning]
You may go.
I’ll take care of the rest and join.
[Mary recites mantra]
Hey, Sohel! Look at me, dear.
Sohel! Look at me.
Look into my eyes.
You got scared, right?
You got scared. You were afraid.
Sohel! You got scared.
[Teeth rattling laugh]
[Thud on the door]
Sohel!
Hey, Sohel! What’s wrong with you?
Sohel!
[GK chants]
Leave her with me
and get out everybody.
[Sighs in fear]
Hey! Please leave her.
Leave her with me.
No, don’t.
Sohel! Let him go!
What are you doing?
Sohel! I’m telling you. Let him go.
Sohel!
That murdere’s
soul possessed you.
Sohel! Stop him!
I’m talking to you!
Stop him!
Antony!
Mary, no matter what happens here,
don’t stop your pooja. Keep reciting.
[Frightening gasp]
Sohel! Let her go.
Let her go, Sohel!
Sohel, let go.
- Listen to me.
Let go.
Sohel!
Why are you fighting with me
for a mere woman?
Do you think she’s an angel
descended from heaven?
Dammit! She’s not an angel!
She’s a mere woman.
I’ll smash you both like a flower!
[Grunting]
Nayudamma!
You are a hopeless
soul without a body!
You are just a slave to the
bodies that don't belong to you.
Don’t forget this!

Tara.
Tara.
Get up, dear.
Tara.
Tara.
Tara.
"Tandanane taneno...
Tandanane taneno"
"Tandanane taneno...
Tandanane taneno"
"Bird won today and
the nest called it back"
"Bird won today and
the nest called it back"
"Mother's lap is filled in joy"
"Called out the kid with love"
"Mother's heart melted"
"Played along and won"
"Wind and the rain are down...
Ponds and rivers overflowed"
"Earth, sky and the forests
danced in joy"
"Tandanane taneno...
Tandanane taneno"
"Tandanane taneno...
Tandanane taneno"
Go to your dad, dear.
"The pebbels and stones played music
and the trees and bushes danced"
"Blue clouds came along and
the lightening joined hands"
"Tandanane taneno...
Tandanane taneno"
"Tandanane taneno...
Tandanane taneno"
Finally you saved that family
from that foetus and Nayudamma.
You are really great.

Hello?
Fine. I’m starting now.
What’s wrong, ma’am?
who called?
You may go.
Someone’s in trouble,
I’ll go and check it.
Can I join you?
This is your last time.
Okay?
Okay.
[Car engine coming to stop]
This looks like the same dog!
You told your villagers to bury it.
Why did they dispose it here?
[Door opened]
Hello?
Anybody in here?
Did you really get a
call from this house?
Looks like there’s nobody here.
What will you do now?
I’ll wait for a while.
What if someone is really in danger?
I’ll go and look around.
