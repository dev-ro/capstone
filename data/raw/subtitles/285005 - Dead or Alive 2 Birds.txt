Listen.
These two are quarrelling.
Yakuza versus the Triads.
ln a big fight.
Then there's this
other tiny Yakuza group.
Both of the
big guys want its help.
To team up with
it and grow stronger.
See? Twenty becomes thirty...
But the little guy arranges a hit...
Why's that?
The big guys are fighting.
lf one of these gets killed...
They'll think
the Chinese did it, then...
You bastards!
And so they lose ten each.
Now how many left?
Ten.
And this?
Ten..
Ten...
Ten...
That's why you're doing it.
Whoops.
Huh?
Whaaaaat?
Dead or Alive 2 - Birds

You sure you did it?
Of course l did it!
ln the back of his head.
ln the crown?
Yeah, the crown.
Drilled right through it.
Watch you jerk.
Hey, watch me!
Watch, watch!
l saw it.
You jerk.
Always dressed like this...
You're not a kid anymore, jerk.
Don't take it out on me.
lt's not funny.
You're the boring jerk.
Look who's talking...

But you stand out

You got cash, huh?
Money... moolah...

Shacked up with some bitch?
No, you're wrong.
$30,000 total.
See ya.
Hang on!
The whole world
loves magic you know!
He seemed like
a really loyal guy though...
You think the
Chinese put him up to it?
No, no way!
He wasn't working
for the other gang either.
Otherwise he wouldn't hire me.
How do you find this stuff out?
lt's a secret!
What's his name?
What?
His name.
The shooter's name? Okamoto.
First name?
Not Kenichi...
Mizuki.
That's your name too isn't it?
l see.
What?
Really...
What?
l knew it.
Knew what?
Amazing.
What is?
What? Tell me!
This is amazing!
Hi it's Mizuki.
Give me back the money!
Huh?
You didn't shoot him in the head!
Yes, l did!
l shot him good.
You jerk! Someone was watching!
You're bluffing!
lt's not me.
l don't mind but...
lf you didn't do it,
they're coming for their money.
The Yakuza are scary.
l'm afraid of the Yakuza.
l don't care. l spent it all.
No way! How'd you spend it so quick?
Why do l have to tell you?
Are you my mom?
l hung up.
You really spent it all?
What'd you spend it on?
lt's a secret.
They hunt.
Him.
He hunts...
Him too.
Won't find him, will l?
Can l get on a flight to Yonago?
Really?
The 1:05 PM.
Ogawa, Mizuki.
ls a mobile okay? Hang on.
Give back the money.
These...

These.
Go back to your own country.
Suspect: Okamoto, Mizuki.
Fried Tofu noodles.
Coming up.
ln the old days...
... we used to look
forward to this on the boat.
You from the islands?
Yeah, Dogo.
You're not?
l'm from Osaka.
Really?
As kids we used to love this.
A trip to the mainland
meant these noodles. For all of us.
We'd all leave the Tofu till last.
Drink the soup fast...
... not touching the Tofu.
Then we'd all wait...
... till the count of three.
2,270 Yen.
Wait for me!
'Scuse!
Thanks very much.
Your real name's Sawada, Shuichi.
Under arrest
for copyright violation.
Stealing people's names...
Didn't ask Kohei either, l bet.
Mizuki.
So you're here.
lf you had to run,
l figured it'd be here.
And then you are. Right here.
lt was a shock,
seeing you cap those guys.
Huh?
You saw?
From a rooftop.
Why?
Waiting like this.
lf you'd been one second slower...
... l would've shot him.
Sorry but...
... l've no idea
what you're saying.
l see.
How come you're so laid back?
You're a criminal on the run.
You should react.
Well...
Where've you been?
All this time.
How about you?
lt's okay.
ls the Dad kind?
Yeah, l guess. The Mom too.
Glad you went?
l guess, but l have to work hard.
But you'll become a fisherman?
Yes l know, l'm doing my best.
That's good.
What're you drawing?
Your face.
Finished.
Does it look like me?
Goblin.
Why'd you make me look like that?
Spitting image.
Mizuki, you should
draw comics and paint.
Whichever.
When are you leaving?
ln the New Year.
Not for ages.
You're leaving
the island, that's amazing.
lt's no big deal.
Don't you think so?
lf it doesn't work out, come back.
We'll wait.
See ya.
Later.
Where are you going? Wait!
Stop.
Leave my shorts!
Our Father who art in Heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses.
Lead us not into temptation...
... and deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Amen.
Let's eat.
Bon Appetit.
Eat up, it's good.
Do you like it?
l'm glad.
Are you going to try it?
lsn't it good?
Eat this.
Eat lots.
There's plenty. Tasty?
Wave to Mizuki.
Mizuki! Keep smiling!
l'm home.
l'm home.
l'm home.
He was a nice man.
When'd they find out?
The next day.
Police called the orphanage.
l should've guessed.
Welcome home.
No one answered at the orphanage.
Forgive me.
lt's terrible.
lf l knew this would happen...
l wouldn't have had you.
Wouldn't have taken you in.
Really.
Please forgive me.
Mizuki.
The blood's stopped.
He's fallen.
l feel sorry for him but...
... nevertheless...
He was a good man!
He wasn't bad!
... you go to hell.
Why'd you run?
Thought l'd get away with it.
l figured the police would send me
back to hear about the fires of hell.
l guess l was scared.
The Supervisor
would've been so upset.
He cried a lot.
Shit.
Are you well? l'm in Yokohama.
l'm having lots of fun.
My Foster Dad is kind.
Yesterday, he praised my painting.
Now l'm off to Tokyo.
So you knew all along?
How long did you keep writing?
Those fake letters.
The last one was from up North.
By then l guessed you knew.
After that it was hard to go back.
l left after that letter.
Really?
Why?
'Cos of me?
You went looking for me?
Other way around.
The way l see it...
... you didn't write because l left
l still can't draw that well.
Finally.
We meet again.
Of all places...
Why here?
l was thinking the same thing.
l guess it's fate huh?
Bullshit.
Piss off.
Goblin.
No way!
Really?
ls this a joke?
Mizuki, Shu...
Look at you! These clothes!
Very "with it"
l can't do it.
Summer vacation, huh?
Love those words.
Summer vacation.
Which means one thing,
the prick poles!
Yeah, the prick poles!
l discovered something.
What?
lf you do this,
it feels really good.
See, right?
You're jerks.
Pissing game!
Three... four.
Good evening.
May l help you?
lt's Larry King.
What?
ls it really her?
Really?
Who do you think it is?
Take a good look. Who is it?
Mizuki and Shu?
Correct.
Do you really recognize me?
ls it really her?
lt's really her.
lt's been a while.
No way. Wow, look!
What's a big deal?
That makes this, idiot!
You're dripping wet.
Please come in.
You mean?
l got a new boat the other day.
$30,000 second hand.
Engine's in great shape
But thinking about it...
My narrow world is
just the sea and that orphanage.
Narrow maybe, but deep.
He's right.
Fancy some?
Yes, please.
Watermelons here are great.
All my prick knows
is her and those poles.
Don't cheat on her.
With the poles?
For old times sake? Piss off.
lmagine that, she'd be shocked.
"You're home late these days"
"Where do you go every night?"
"Why're your pants so shiny?"
Multiple shooting in Tokyo.
So what do you guys do?
For work?
You should go see the old man.
l know it's not easy but...
Do you know he got burned?
He doesn't run the orphanage now.
Do you remember Toshi?
That tough old geezer?
He's in charge now.
Burned?
There was a big fire next door.
Someone said their
grandchild was trapped inside.
So the old man dashed inside.
Turned out the kid
was outside all along.
Wow!
Who the hell's that?
lt's me.
Fancy he kept this.
Look at that!
That's the old ferry!
What's that?
We took a trip to that island.
What year was this?
Shu?
Don't worry, he's okay.
He's just crying.
He always does.
Ready or not...
Here l come!
Travelling Children's Theater
All four of them?
Two discharged today.
Oh dear me!
We're so sorry!
lt was an accident, after all.
What'll we do?
The kids must be disappointed.
Again, our apologies.
You just need two more?
l was so surprised
when he said he'd do it.
lf it was Mizuki maybe,
but not him.
Did he really say he'd do it?
He loves stuff like that.
Always did.
Used to be in the school plays.
They messed up the
Nativity play one time.
They both played Wise Men.
Mizuki started it all.
Started talking about
taking over the world.
Stripped off to the waist.
Had these chains
hanging off his shoulders.
Began slapping
them from side to side.
Challenged Shu to a fight on stage.
Shu had a towel
stuffed down his pants.
Started tugging
this long prick out.
And started slapping back.
Then it got really serious.
And they were
really hitting each other.
Finished it.
Shu-ichi!!!!
Don't worry.
Can l trust you?
Obscenity is a crime y'know!
We'll only show a bit.
Won't we?
Sure.
And now the latest
on last week's shooting...
... of the head of
the Arakawa crime syndicate.
The suspect, a former associate,
is still at large.
Mizuki Okamoto is
wanted in connection...
... with the shooting deaths...
... of a total
of eight gang members...
... and the wounding
of seven others.
Okamoto fled the scene
and has not been seen since.
The Arakawa group
is in a turf war with a Chinese...
Multiple shooting in Tokyo
l'm home.
How come there are so many?
Oh heck!
Hello Mayor.
Hello Boys and Girls!
Once upon a time
in a land far away...
... there was a lion
who loved doughnuts and chocolate.
Down from the mountain
for just one night...
What's that sound?
Wait!
Surely you're not... ?
Who me?
l'm lonely no more.
l'm Cinderella.
l'm the pretty honeybee.
l'm the little brown boy.
l'm the wise owl.
Now the lion's no longer alone.
Stop messing with me.
Don't you dare mess with me.
Want some?
Ouch.
Jerk!
Behold!
Lion kick!
lf you have compassion..
... love and courage...
... everyone's your friend.
Right Kohei?
Compassion!
Love!
And Courage!
Good boy Kohei!
Well done, Mizuki!
Good job Shu!
With the power of love!
Thank you!
l should get going.
lt was fun.
What're you going to do?
After the hit,
where were you going to go?
l had no plan.
l just opened fire.
l was wishing l was back here,
then there was a noise.
l realized then it was me shooting.
Next thing l knew l was here with you.
Hey.
Wanna work with me?
ln Osaka or some place.
l donate all the money.
There are kids overseas
too poor to get medicine.
You know how we bump off some jerk...
... some idiot
the world's better off without...
... for $30,000 or so?
lt's different from
country to country but...
... in some places
a vaccination's only 30 cents.
With $30,000 you could
save 100,000 kids.
Pretty cool, huh?
Get rid of one jerk,
help 100,000 kids.
Fancy it?
lt's unlike you
to come up with a plan.
Makes a change then.
You'd be happy if l joined you?
Not so much happy as...
Yeah, suppose so.
l owe you anyway.
Why?
l'll come along.
'Til l die.
Who sent you?
No one did.
How did you find us?
We just stumbled upon you.
We're pretty damn good.
lt's time.
Jiro!
Jiro!
Jiro...
Umanami, Jiro
Hot... hahaha... hot...
hahaha... hot... hahaha...
Target Located
What is it?
What do you want?
August's Most Requested Host,
Umanami Jiro
You did him, yeah?
WRONG GUY?
What?
What do you want?
DEATH
We did it at last.
We saved this many.
20 grand a pop.
l've done twenty three.
That's 460 thousand.
Then we've done
thirteen together...
What's wrong?
Are you happy?
Of course.
That's good.
He's late.
Where's that blood coming from?
l was always ready
to be shot by some jerk...
... didn't think
it'd end like this.
Stop scaring me.
You must've known.
That's why you're here.
Don't talk nonsense.
How bad is it?
Let's go see a doctor!
We're not burning
money to keep me alive!
lt's a waste.
The world's better off without me.
Why?
You're wrong.
He's here.
Back to work.
Vaccines.
For the vaccines!
All that cash just to do this?
l hope we're not late.
lf they ask for it back,
you pay the hotel.
But it's your fault!
So what?
Oh Christ.
Crowded...
... up here.
Sounds like it.
l'm sorry.
What for?
Fried tofu noodles.
As long as...
... there were plenty...
... of noodles...
... things were supposed to go well.
ls everything alright?
There's a lot of blood...
That much we know.
We're not fools.
We're in the elderly seats.
But it's not crowded.
ls it?
Shall l take it?
l'll do it. Get over there.
Move together.
Okay smile, and cheese.
ls everything ok?
Of course!
lt'll come out fine!
l'm fine. Don't worry.
Welcome aboard.
Everyone's worried about us.
Wonder if it's born yet?
Kohei's kid.
Maybe.
Hope it's okay.
Hope she's well too.
Don't worry.
Medicine's come along way.
Babies are cool.
l like their little fists...
Tiny fists...
Ready?
Three... two... one...
lt's sweet.
So sweet.
You always have to be first.
l guess this means...
... we're going to hell.
l am, at least.
Well, if it comes to that...
... let's go together.
We're home.
lt's your first time.
Look at your house.
lt's your home.
Put him down here.
Here we are.
Doesn't he want milk?
