Dr Furtwangler,
the Reich Minister.
Dr Furtwangler,
l apologise forthis powerfailure.
lwas so enjoyingthe performance.
ln times like these we need
spiritual nourishment.
BOMBS EXPLODlNG
But lwelcome this unexpected
opportunity...
..oftalkingto you.
When you came to the platform
tonight, lthoughtyou weren'twell.
You lookedtired.
Get awayfrom this bombing,
awayfrom the war.
You should go abroad.
Yes, you looktired...
..even in this light.
Look atthem. Men, women, kids.
Boy, didtheylove him.
AdolfHitlertouched something
real deep, savage and barbaric
and itwon't go away overnight,
it's gotto be rooted out.
You knowwhat lthink?
lthinktheywere all Nazis.
Andtheirleaders,
nowon trial in Nuremberg,
couldn'thave done it alone.
lt's these people. They gave
allthe help thatwas needed.
That's him. Furtwangler.
Wilhelm Furtwangler.
- So, you've neverheard ofhim?
- Nope.
- You've heard ofArturo Toscanini?
- Sure.
He's as big as Toscanini,
maybe even bigger.
He's like Bob Hope
and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Jeez, and l've neverheard ofhim!
You were in insurance before the war.
Right.Aclaims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said lwas dogged?
They saywhen you went
on a case, you stayed on it.
We can'ttake everyNazi in this
countryto trial, it's impossible.
So we're goingforthe big boys in
industry, education, lawand culture.
Like the bandleader?
Well, he's more than that, Steve.
He's a great conductor.
Agifted artist.
Butwe believe
he sold himselfto the devil.
Yournumberone priority
is to connecthim to the Nazi Party.
Don'tbe impressed byhim. lwant
ourfolks to knowwhywe fought.
FindWilhelm Furtwanglerguilty.
He represents all
thatwas rotten in Germany.
Stay put, Steve.There's some other
stuffthat l'd like you to see here.
Background.
Oh, one thingthatmaybe a problem.
OurOccupation Authorities
in Wiesbaden have a duty
to help these poorunfortunates
with theirdefence.
Theykeep repeating, ''We mustbe
just, we must appearas beingjust.''
l onlyhave one thingto sayto
fuck'em!
You answerto no one butme.
ls thatunderstood?
- Showhim the film.
- Yes, sir.
That is the hand
that droppedthe bombs ondefenceless
Rotterdam, Brussels, Belgrade.
That is the handthat destroyedthe
cities, villages and homes ofRussia.
That is the hand that
heldthe whipoverthe Polish...
Nextreel, please.
..French and Norwegian slaves.
That is the hand
thattooktheirfood.
Sanitary conditions were so bad
that heavy equipmentwas brought
in to speedthecleaning up.
This was Bergen-Belsen.
Remember men,
no fraternisation.
ln a Germantown ifyou bowto a
pretty girlor pat a blond child,
you bowto Hitler,
you bowto his relgnofblood,
you caress the ldeology
that meant death and destruction.
You never know
who is a member ofthe NaziParty.
Don't be fooled. Don'tfraternise.
Cigarettes, chewing gum?
Cigarettes, chewing gum?
The heatingwill be fixed bytonight.
Fraulein, this is MajorArnold.

Howlongwere you in the camp for?
Three months.

Myfatherwas one ofthe officers
in a plot againstHitler.
They arrestedthe plotters
andtheirfamilies.
- Andyourmother, too.

Andyourfatherwas executed?

A Lieutenant DavidWills called

Dr Furtwanglerhas calledwanting

Do you thinkyou can

Oh yes, Major, l have recordings

l keptthem safe duringthe bombing.
Myfavourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Mine's the Eleventh.
Buthe onlywrote nine, Major.

Do you have a record player?
No. Ours was damaged.
What's in those files?
The members ofthe Berlin
Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934
andtheirquestionnaires.
Major, what am l
to tell Dr Furtwangler?
You tell him nothing, Emmi.
Just say you knownothing.
We'll keep himwaiting

andwith the witnesses
and, God help me, with Beethoven.
MARKETHUBBUB
- Wo finde ich Grammophone?

Yeah.
Lieutenant Wills reporting

- DavidWills. Liaison officer.
Allied Kommandatura
CulturalAffairs Committee.
Sounds like fun. So they
sentthe big guns to check up on me?
- Are we recruiting children now?
- l guess so, sir.
Don't call me ''sir''
or l'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Where you from, David?
lwas born here. ln Leipzig.
l escaped in '36. My parents sentme
to my uncle in Philadelphia.
Theywere to follow,
butthey delayed and...
Ourname was Weill.
lt doesn't soundwell in English,
so my uncle changed itto Wills...
Come in, Emmi.
This is youroffice too.
Emmi, this is Lieutenant David
Wills. He's here to watch overus.
- l guess you admire musicians?
- Some.
Don't.This is
a criminal investigation, David.
Musicians, morticians, doctors,
lawyers, butchers, clerks.
They're allthe same.
We have a duty, a moral duty.
SymphonyNo. 5
ltworks!
Hallelujah!
Herr RudolfWerner.
Sit down, Werner.
lwantyou to understand
why you're here.
This is an investigation
into Wilhelm Furtwangler,
former Prussian Privy Councillor,
bannedfrom public life
underControl Council Directive
No. 24.
He's appliedto come
before the TribunalforArtists
ofthe Denazification Commission.
l'm interested in whathe was up to
from 1933 to the end ofthe war.
- Understood?
- Yes.
RudolfOtto Werner-
wind section since 1936.
- Whatinstrument didyou play?
- First oboe.
Yourquestionnaire says you were
nevera memberofthe Nazi Party.
Absolutelynot.
No, lwas nevera Nazi.
l'm a musician.
Slowdown. Fraulein Straube
has to take down whatyou say.
Straube?
Anyrelation
to Colonel Joachim Straube?
Myfather.
lt's an honourto meetyou.
Yourfatherwas a greatpatriot.
Dr Furtwangleris a greatmusician.
He opposedthe Nazis.
Lateron, he helped
many Jews escape.
Buthe was
a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Hermann Goeringjustmade him his
Privy Councillor, no questions asked.
But Dr Furtwanglerstood up to him
andto DrGoebbels.
He also conductedforHitler.
Yes, that's true, buthe refused
to give the Nazi salute.
ln Hitler's presence,
thatwas a brave act.
Brave? To celebrate Hitler's birthday
with some heroic piece by Wagner,
butwithoutthe Nazi salute? Bravo!
ltwas Beethoven's Ninth.
Do you reallythinkitwas brave?
Didn'the bowto him
and shake his hand?
No, no, no, l give you myword. lwas
nevera memberofthe Nazi Party.
l am in the percussion section.
l playthe timpani.
Theywould neverhave allowed it-
mybrotherwas marriedto a Jewess.
And Goebbels said...
Please take this down carefully,
it's important, Fraulein?
- Straube.
- Straube.
Are you related
to Colonel Joachim Straube?
Myfather.
He was... He was a greathero.
Goebbels, yes, he said,
''There's not a single filthy Jew
leftin Germany on whose behalf
Dr Furtwanglerhas notintervened.''
No-one could have been
less ofa Nazi.
Butthis was the guywho conducted
forAdolf on his birthday?
He was forcedto do that.
He refusedto give the Nazi salute.
He kepthis baton in this hand.
Andwhat aboutthe Nuremberg Rally?
No, we played on the evening
before the rally.
The evening before, l see.
Yes, sir, Dr Furtwangler
was absolutely clearaboutthis:
politics and art
mustbe kept separate.
Politics and artmustbe kept
separate. l'll rememberthat.
But see ifyou can help me with
something ljust don'tunderstand.
l'd reallylike to knowwhy
allyou guys are so crazy abouthim?
What's his secret?
Well, l can only
tellyou from my own experience.
Soon after ljoinedthe orchestra,
we rehearsed
the Third Symphony ofBeethoven.
There are several
difficultpassages forthe timpani,
one particularcrescendo.
Duringthe break,
l asked howhe wanted itplayed.
He was studying his score.
He didn'tlook up.
He said, ''Justwatch me.''
So, ofcourse, l did.
l neverstoppedwatching him.
The moment came
and suddenlyhe turnedto me
and oureyes were locked.
There was something in his look
that simply demandedthe crescendo.
l shall neverforgetthis look.
ltwas a moment of... magic.
Didyou eversee AdolfHitler's eyes
when he was making a speech?
l've seen him on films.
Yes.
Was itlike looking at Furtwangler?
l don'tknowwhatyou mean.
When you gotto the crescendo.
Do you think an orchestra, 120 orso
guys, could be orchestrated?
l guess it's possible.
So, what does the Ruskiwant?
Colonel Dymshitz
has asked speciallyto see you.
''Dim-shits''?
MURMUR OF CONVERSATlON
What are they doing?
They're sorting out some
works ofartthe Nazis stole
from occupiedterritories-
who really owns what?
That's Colonel Dymshitz,
on the farside- arthistorian.
Head ofthe famous Leningrad Museum
ofArt, an expert on German culture.
Cette peinture n'appartientpas
a l'URSS, mais a la France.
- Whatwas that?
- The picture belongs to France.
C'estun Braque, qui avec Picasso
etaitun des pionniers du cubisme.
l knowwho Georges Braque is.
We can produce the provenance
ofthis Braque.
- Hello, Major. l'm Colonel Dymshitz.
- Colonel.
So, Major, tell me,
have you questioned Dr Furtwangler?
Notyet.
l hadtwo meetings with him.
He's a greatmusician,
maybe the greatest conductor
in the world.
His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert,
unequalled.
l'll come to the point. l offered him
a very attractive position -
conductorof
the StaatsoperUnten den Linden.
He refused.
But lwanthim. lwanthim badly
and lwantyourhelp.
Just a moment, you should
have discussedthis with me first.
l'm discussingwith you now. Major,
lwantyou to drop the investigation,
save everybodytime andtrouble.
We can't drop a case justlike that.
l'll give you anotherconductor
in exchange-
writers, musicians, actors...
What do you care?
But l like Furtwangler.
He's myfavourite conductor.
Mine and Hitler's!
He's ourfavourite conductor.
l clickmyheels
and bowatthe same time.
You had a properupbringing.
That's right. lwas raised
very strictly. We were very German.
Only speakifyou're spoken to.
- And don'twave yourhands about.
- Respectyourelders.
- No elbows on the table.
- Eating is eating and...
Talking is talking.
lthinkwe'd betterget on.
Right, so this is goingto be
veryformaltoo now;
Lieutenant DavidWills
requests the company
ofFraulein Emmi Straube at dinner,
anynight she cares.
David, l needto askyou something.
Have you heardthis rumour
the British foundthe HinkelArchive?
- Yes.
- So, whatis it?
The British occupythe building
where this guy, Hinkel,
ran the Nazi Ministry ofCulture.
lt seems they've discovered
a secret archive.
What's thatmean?
l don'tknow, butthe rumouris
Hinkel kept a file on every artist
working in the Third Reich.
Jeez. Andyou thinkthe British
will share itwith theirAllies?
- Major Richards will letus know.
- That's big ofhim.
OK, l betterquestion
the nextwitness.
l betyou a bottle ofchampagne,
he'lltell us the baton story
inside ten minutes.
- Five minutes.
- lt's a bet. Emmi's the witness.
Helmuth Alfred Rode,
secondviolinist since 1935.
What's a secondviolinist?
Not good enough
to be a firstviolinist.
Good.
Accordingto yourquestionnaire,
you neverjoinedthe Nazi Party.
Me? Never. Never.
Everyone nowsays that,
butin my case itis one hundred
percenttrue. l'm a Catholic.
ltwould be againstmy conscience.
Are you interviewing
Dr Furtwanglertoday?
l'll askthe questions, Helmuth.
Excuse me.
He refusedto give the Nazi salute
when Hitlerwas in the audience.
The problemwas howcould he avoid
givingthe devil's salute
and l saidto Dr Furtwangler,
''Whynot enterwith the baton
in yourrighthand?''
''lfyou give the salute to Hitler
with the baton in yourrighthand,
itwill looklike you're going
to poke his eyes out.''
He was really grateful
to me forthat.
Afterthe concert,
l stole thatbaton
as a memento ofa great act
ofcourage. l still have it.
l should have broughtit.
l hope l'm not going
too fastforyou, Fraulein...?
- Straube.
- Straube?
Anyrelation
to Colonel Joachim Straube?
Myfather.
l'm honouredto be in yourpresence.
Yourfatherwas a true patriot.
Do you have a question, David?
Howdidthe orchestra react
to playingforHitler's birthday?
We playedthe evening before.
ltwas 19th April notthe 20th.
Do you knowHans Hinkel?
- Do l knowHans Hinkel?
- That's what l asked.
Do l knowHans Hinkel?
Howabout answeringthe question?
Hans Hinkelwas in the Ministry
ofCulture, howcould l knowhim?
l hearthe...
..the British have his archive-
records, files.
- Do you knowwhat's in this archive?
- Howcould l know?
OK, you can go, Helmuth. Get out.
SymphonyNo. 5
- Wollen Sie? Setzen Sie sich.
- Nein, danke.
Furtwangler.
Major! He's here.
Shutthe door, Emmi. Sit down.
We're goingto keep himwaiting.
Emmi, getus some coffee.
Don't offerhim coffee.
Don't even greethim.
Fraulein.
Fraulein, howlong
am lto be keptwaiting?
OK, Emmi. Go gethim.
Dr Furtwangler.
l didn'thearanyone
invite you to sit down.
Sitthere.
lwantyou to knowwhy you're here.
You're bannedfrom public life
underControl
Council Directive No. 24.
We're reviewing yourcase
forthe TribunalforArtists
ofthe Denazification Commission.
Do you understand?
l've been cleared bythe
Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
Whatthey do in Austria
doesn'tinterestme. OK?
l have yourquestionnaire here.
Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin
Wilhelm Furtwangler,
born Berlin, January 1886.
Orchestral conductor.
Andyou sayhere you were never
a memberofthe Nazi Party.
Thatis correct.
You were a Prussian Privy Councillor,
butnot a memberofthe Party?
l received a telegram from Goering
telling me lwas a Privy Councillor.
lwas given no opportunity
to accept orrefuse.
Afterthe dreadful attacks
ofNovember 1938 on the Jews,
l stopped usingthe title.
What about Vice President
ofthe ChamberofMusic?
You usedthattitle, didn'tyou?
l suppose thatwas because
DrGoebbels sentyou a telegram,
saying, ''Dear Mr Vice President.''
l don'tthink Goebbels sentme
a telegram. lwas told in a letter.
- l don'trememberexactly.
- Theywere heaping honours on you.
Privy Councillor, Vice President
ofthe ChamberofMusic...
Andyou weren'tin the Party?
Howdo you explain that?
Goering and Goebbels battled
forcontrol ofGerman culture.
lwas simply a pawn.
l resignedfrom the Musikkammer,
andfrom being Musical Director
ofthe Berlin Philharmonic in 1934.
Why didyou resign, Dr Furtwangler?
l condemned
whattheywere doingto music,
making distinctions
between Jews and non-Jews.
Formy part, the only divide in art
is between good and bad.
Eventually, Goebbels summoned me.
He said l could leave the country
iflwantedto,
butunderno condition
could l everreturn.
l believe you have to fight
from the inside notfromwithout.
l asked myself, whatis the duty
ofan artist? To stay orto leave?
Then he demanded l acknowledge Hitler
as responsible forcultural policy.
Well, thatwas a fact and it seemed
pointless to deny.
l simply acknowledgedthatHitler
and his MinisterofCulture
were solelyresponsible
forthe cultural policy ofthe Reich.
l had no responsibility
whatsoeverfortheircultural policy.
Art and politics should have
nothingto do with each other.
Why conduct at a Nuremberg rally?
l did not conduct atthe rally...
l conducted on the evening before.
That sounds like the small print
in one of ourinsurance policies.
Andwhat about April 19, 1942?
The eve ofHitler's 53rd birthday?
The big celebration.
You conductedforHitler, didn'tyou?
Was thatin keeping
with art and politics
having nothingto do with each other?
- Thatwas different, lwas tricked.
- Howcome?
Could l have
a glass ofwater, please?
- Please, Fraulein?
- Straube.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
lwas in Vienna, rehearsing,
when Goebbels called
and said l hadto conduct
atHitler's birthday.
l'd always managed
to wriggle out ofsuch invitations,
pleading previous engagements,
illness and so on.
Also, Baldurvon Shirach,
who controlled Vienna,
hated DrGoebbels andwould
do anythingto thwarthis wishes.
Butthis time, Goebbels
gotto my doctors before me,
theywere frightened off,
and Von Shirach was threatened.
l had no alternative
butto conductforHitler.
Believe me, l knewl had compromised
and l deeplyregretit.
Doesn't sound much ofa trickto me.
Sounds like you made a deal.
- l made no deal.
- l don'tbuythat.
lt's the truth.
l hearyou helped a lot ofJews
to escape. Howdidyou do that?
l don'trememberin detail,
there were so many.
- Didyou call someone you knew?
- l don'tremember.
Letme help you.You picked up
the phone and made a call,
''Hi, Adolf?.Wilhelm speaking. Listen,
old pal, there's a Jew-boymusician
lwantyou to help.
He needs a permitto getto Paris.''
Ormaybe you called
Goering orGoebbels?
You were in
the same shithouse as them.
- May l ask a question?
- Sure.
- When will my case be heard?
- Yourguess is as good as mine.
l needto work and make myliving.
l live offthe generosity offriends.
Tough! Tough!
Then whyis it, that another
conductorwho was a Partymember,
and playedthe Horst Wessel before
his concerts, has been cleared?
While l have to wait
andwait andwait?
l don'tknow. ltwasn'tmy case.
Why didyou escape to Switzerland?
What?
Why didyou escape to Switzerland
justbefore the warended?
l learnedthatthe Gestapo
was aboutto arrestme.
- Whywere they goingto arrestyou?
- l'dwritten a letterto Goebbels.
ltlamentedthe decline ofmusical
standards due to racial policies.
You didn't complain
aboutthe racial policies,
just aboutthe musical standards,
is thatright?
So, howdidyou learn
thatthe Gestapo was outto getyou?
During an interval at a concert
here in Berlin, Albert Speer,
the MinisterofArmaments,
saidto me,
''You looktired, Mr Furtwangler,
you should go abroadfora while.''
l knewexactlywhathe meant.
You sure knew
a lot ofpeople in high places.
lt's true that a lot ofpeople
in high places knewme.
You were close to allofthem.
To Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph,
to Baldurand now, Albert.
So let's hearthe truth.
Let's come clean.
Whatwas your Partynumber?
Major, you should do yourhomework.
You have no idea
howstupidyourquestions are.
David, do you remember
l said l had a question forWilhelm
thathe wouldn'tbe able to answer?
Are you readyforthis, Wilhelm?
lt's a tough one.
Why didn'tyou get out
when Hitlercame to powerin '33?
Why didn'tyou leave Germany?
l have a list ofnames ofpeople in
yourprofession who got outin '33.
Bruno Walter,
Arnold Schonberg, Max Reinhardt...
Theywere Jews, theyhadto leave.
Theywere rightto leave.
l could notleave my country
in herdeepestmisery.
Afterall, l am German.
l stayed in myhomeland.
ls thatmy sin in youreyes?
See, David?
He can't answerthe question.
l'll askit again, Wilhelm.
Don't give me
anymore intellectual bullshit.
PHONE RlNGS
MajorArnold's office.
Yes, he is.
lt's Major Richards
for Lieutenant DavidWills.
DavidWills here, sir.
You wantme to tell him? OK.
Major Richards wants a word.
Why can'the just askforme? Why
does he have to askforyou first?
Goddamn British, so correct.
Steve Arnold.
l've had enough ofthis,
l'm leaving.
Dr Furtwangler, please.
lt's not advisable.
When lwas a child, myfathertookme
to one ofyourconcerts.
You conducted
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
lwas deeplymoved.
And l've loved music eversince.
lwas gratefulto you.
And l've admiredyou.
Howcouldyou serve those criminals?
Howmany?
Jesus, that's dynamite!
Dr Furtwangler.
Well now.Aren'twe all sociable?
l've gotto hand itto the British,
David.You knowwhatthose guys are?
Decent.
Tell me, Dr Furtwangler,
do you knowHans Hinkel?
l knowofhim.
Adespicable human being.
He was in the Ministry ofCulture.
His job was to getrid
ofJews in the arts.
You knowwhat else the little creep
did? He keptfiles, 250,000 files.
Do you knowwhat's in them?
No, but l knewhe had informers
everywhere, even in my orchestra.
Who?
- lwasn'ttold. ljustknew.
- How?
- lwas warned.
- Who warnedyou?
Goering because Hinkel
was workingforGoebbels.
What did Goering say?
He told me one ofGoebbels'
men was watching me.
He read a report on me,
everything l saidwas quoted.
Oh boy, you're goingto love this.
Those files contain the details of
everyworking artistin this country.
Those files willtell us
who joinedthe Party,
who informed andwho was helpful.
- Name?
- DavidWills.
Overthere.
Fantastic!
The only condition is
we have to do the workhere.
lwantyou to collect allthe files
on the boys in the band.
Have a look atthis.
Schubert.
String Quintet Adagio
Bravo! Well played!
Bravo!
Dr Furtwangler.
Moving, do you agree?
Whenever l hearSchubert l am moved.
Do you agree?
The tempiwere a little too correct,
butthatmaybe because ofthe rain.
Herr Doctor, l understandyou
have difficulties with the Americans?
lwantyou to know
l amyourchampion. We can help.
- What does he mean bytoo correct?
- l don'tknow.

ofplea bargaining?
Talk aboutpower,
l have the powerto give you work
and make yourlife easier.
Yourpastwon'tbe mentioned.
But l have to get something
in return -that's plea bargaining.
l can give you freedom ofmovement,
freedom to work...
..but l need something in return.
- Major, he's a man ofgenius.
- Fuckthat, Helmuth.
You wantto discuss symbols here?
This guywas a frontman.
He was the piper,
buthe playedtheirtune.
l'm not aftersmallfish,
l'm after Moby Dick.
Come on, Helmuth. Hardfacts.
Well, the onlything l know
is he's an anti-Semite.
Ofcourse. You, too. Like everyone
else in this goddamn country.
- l've remembered something else.
- Yeah?
FurtwanglersentHitler
a birthdaytelegram.
He did?
- One ofyourpeople told me.
- One ofmy people?
Yes.Acorporal. US Army. AJew.
He said he'd seen the telegram
in the Chancellery.
Son-of-a-gun. We'llfindthe corporal
andwe'llfindthe telegram.
But l need documentary proof.
- Do you knowofanything like that?
- No.
That's whywe hated him.
We admired him,
butwe all hated him
because he didn'thave
to join the Party.
He didn'thave to deliver
a report aftereverytrip abroad.
He got everythingfrom them,
everything.
He was filthier
than any ofus Partymembers.
There's a rumour-
l don'tknowifit's true,
but askhim about Von derNuell.
- Neverheard ofhim, who is he?
- Amusic critic.
He gave Furtwanglerawful reviews,
butraved aboutHerbertvon Karajan.
- Who's he?
- Abrilliant conductoralso.
Von derNuell called him
''The Miracle von Karajan''.
Furtwanglerwas outraged
andthey sayhe had Von derNuell
conscripted into the army.
lt also happenedto anothercritic.
Well, true ornot,
it's not such a bad idea.
Critics give you bad reviews,
you sendthem to the Russian front.
Butifyou reallywant
to get Furtwangler,
askhim aboutHerbertvon Karajan.
- The Miracle Kid.
- Yes.
You maynotice he can't even utter
his name. He refers to him as ''K''.
And...
Askhim abouthis private life.
- His private life?
- Yes.
lt's all in here- his women.
Who orderedyou to gatherinformation
abouthis private life? Hinkel?
- Where do you stand on allthis?
- On allwhat?
On Furtwangler?
l don'tknow.
You representthe US now.
We have a moral dutyto be just.
MajorArnold also has a moral duty.
Ourdutyis to help Furtwangler,
so lwantyou to look atthis.
These are the Nuremberg
trialtranscripts.
- You understand German, right?
- Hm-mn.
That's the evidence ofDahlerus. He's
a Swede, a friend ofHermann Goering.
lwantyou to studyit and use it.
We'llfindyou some otherstufftoo.
We needto build a defence case
based not on feelings,
not on prejudice, but on facts.
Lieutenant Wills. HerrSchlee,
timpanist. Herr Romer, cello.
HerrSchmidt, viola.
They are willingto help.
- We've ordered coffee. l hope you...
- Ofcourse.
The whole orchestra
willvouch forhim.
We need names and addresses of
musicians saved by Dr Furtwangler,
people he helpedto escape abroad.
Let's go somewhere less public.
To cooperation.
lwas in Vienna. l hadwith me
an Austrian chauffeur.
He spenttime in the camps.
We were looking atthese Viennese
cleaning up the bomb damage,
scavengingforrottingfood,
butt ends, anything.
l said, ''To think a million ofthese
people came outto welcome Adolf
on the dayhe enteredthe city, a
million of'em, and nowlook at'em.''
And Max said,
''Oh, notthese people, Major.''
''These people were all athome
hiding Jews in theirattics.''
Do you getthe point, Colonel?
The pointis they're all
full ofshit.
Furtwangler
is in a different category.
We're dealingwith degenerates here.
Degenerates?
He's a great artist.
That's whyhe didn't getthe hell
out ofhere when he hadthe chance?
l putthatto him,
he couldn't answer.
Why didn'the go and do itin America
like that ltalian, Toscanini?
Perhaps he believed he couldtry
to preserve some importantthings
like an orchestra, a school.
Maybe he has an old mother
who can'tbe left alone.
Orbrothers, sisters...
Colonel, he had no sisters, no
brothers, only a lot oflove affairs.
Anyway, Major,
why should he leave his country,
his mothertongue, his family,
his history, his past, his future?
Justbecause nowsuddenly
there is a dictatorship? Why?
Numberone, ifallthatturns rotten,
whatifthey surroundthe space
with barbedwire, Colonel?
Don'ttalk aboutthings
you knownothing about.
He was in a dictatorship.
Art and politics,
l heard all aboutit.
Arts belongto the Party.
lfyou wantto be a conductor,
you have to have an orchestra.
You can only get an orchestra
ifyou have contactwith a power.
All overthe world
you needthe right contacts
andyou have to make compromises.
This is what l'm saying.
He musthave had Party contacts.
There are good Partymembers who help
andthere are dirtynon-Partymembers
who inform on you.
Ofcourse they gave him privileges
and suddenly, Steve, suddenly
you notice thattheylike you,
theyhonouryou and suddenly
you're the directorofthe best
museum in the world, forexample.
Which museum?
Museum?
No, l said orchestra, sorry.
Believe me, Steve. Help me, Steve.
You say you answer
forsomeone from high up.
ltoo, orderthis from high up...
veryhigh up.
We want Furtwangler.
l'll give you in return the whole
orchestra, fourorfive conductors.
- l need him, Steve.
- No can do.
Let Furtwanglergo, please.
l have a duty.
Duty? l'm sorry.
GLASS SMASHES
Duty! Fucking duty!
Trouble is, you Americans
want everyone to live like you.
We liberated Berlin, Major, notyou!
We have a duty also, to bring
backthe best ofGerman culture.
l'm goingto get
thatfucking bandleader.
No deal!
No fucking deal.
Then you're goingto kill me.
You'llsee ruins.
You'llsee flowers.
You'llsee
some mlghty pretty scenery.
Don't let itfoolyou.
You are in enemy country.
The NaziParty may begone,
but Nazithinking, Nazitraining
and Nazitrickery remain.
Somewhere inthis Germany, there are
two million ex-Naziofficials.
Out ofpower, but still inthere
andthinking...
thinking about nexttime.
Only yesterday, every business
was part ofHitler's system.
Practically every German
was part ofthe Nazi network.
They believetheywere born
to be masters. Don't argue.
You are not being sent into
Germany as educators.
You are soldiers onguard.
Youwillobservetheir local laws,
respecttheir customs and rellgion.
Youwillrespect property rlghts.
Youwill not be friendly.
Youwill be aloof, watchful
and suspicious.
- Haben Sie Bruckner?
- Ja, hab ich.
Die Siebte.
- Wie viel?
- 200.
l read Furtwanglerwas askedto lead
the New York Philharmonic in '36.
Toscanini suggested it.
He would have become the most
celebrated conductorin America.
When he made his decision,
he didn'tknoweverything.
Especiallynotthe way
people like you do,
who return from exile andfeel
you have a rightto pass judgement.
Because you are blameless, you think
you knowwho deserves forgiveness.
You have no idea howpeople lived.
When he shookHitler's hand,
was he pleased?
l don'tknow... butyou and l already
knowthathe has saved lives.
ln Bruckner's Seventh, do you know
where the Adagio begins?
Ofcourse.
Putit on
and l'lltellyou when to playit.
ltis nownine o'clockprecisely.
l do notintendto be keptwaiting.
Don'ttalkto me
like a secondviolinist.
Go backinto the waiting room.
Miss Straube will come getyou
when l am ready.
Jesus God,
who the hell does he thinkhe is?
Who the hell does he thinkhe is?
Wouldyou like some water,
Herr Professor?
Whatis he doing here?
Dr Furtwangler!
Come in, come in, sit down.
Take this one,
it's more comfortable.
lfit's too hot, open yourtie.
lwish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
When l last sawyou lwas unprepared.
ln these pastweeks, l have thought
carefully and l've made some notes.
You have to understand
who l am andwhat l am.
l am a musician
and l believe in music.
l am an artist and l believe in art.
Artin general,
and music in particular,
has forme mystical powers
which nurture man's spiritual needs.
l must confess, however,
to being extremelynaive.
l insistedforyears on the absolute
separation ofart and politics.
My entire life was devoted
to music because-
andthis is veryimportant-
because lthoughtthat l could,
through music,
do something practical.
Andwhatwas that?
To maintain liberty,
humanity and justice.
Gee, that's a thing ofbeauty,
honestto God.
l'm goingto tryto rememberthat.
Liberty, humanity
and justice. Beautiful.
Butyou said ''naive''.
Are you saying you were wrong?
That art and politics
can'tbe separated?
l believe they should be separated,
butthattheyweren't,
l learnedto my cost.
Didyou learn thatwhen you sentthe
telegram? Was thatthe white flag?
Whattelegram?
''Happybirthday, dearAdolf.''
Something like that.
You're on yourknees saying,
''OKAdolf, you win.
You're the numberone man.''
What are you talking about?
The birthday greetings
you sentto Hitler.
l neversenthim
anykind ofgreetings.
Think carefully, Wilhelm.
Notin yourname.
As Privy Councillor.
This is utterlyridiculous!
Yes, David?
ShowDr Furtwanglerthe evidence
to refresh his memory.
You won'tfind it
because no such telegram exists.
Well, ltried.
You've gotto admit ltried.
lthought l mighttrap you, Wilhelm.
But David here was too quickforme.
Smartmove, David.
Smartmove.
No, l don'thave the telegram,
but l knowit exists.
Andwe'll keep lookingforit
because l believe you sentit.
You're wrong.
Art and politics, art and politics.
Let's take a look atthat.
You andthe Berlin Philharmonic
played in countries
the Nazis had conquered.
Are you sayingthat conducting
in occupiedterritories from 1939 on
wasn't a commercialforAdolf's rule?
We neverofficiallyrepresented
the regime abroad.
We performed as a private ensemble.
lwas a freelance conductor.
You know, you should've written
ourinsurance policies forus.
You've gotmore exclusion clauses
than Double lndemnity.
What do you imagine people thought?
The Berlin Philharmonic's run by Dr
Goebbels andthe Propaganda Ministry,
but Wilhelm's freelance, so art and
politics are nowentirely separate?
You believed
ordinary people thoughtthat?
l have no idea whattheythought.
No?
No, because l had only one intention.
My onlyintention, whatever l did,
was to showthat
music means more than politics.
Tell me about Von derNuell.
Von derNuell?
Yes, Von derNuell.
Von derNuell?
Howlong is this goingto go on?
l saythe name, then you sayit.
l sayit, then you sayit.
We could go on all day.
You knowwho Von derNuell is?
Edwin von derNuell, music critic.
Yes, l knowwho he is.
ls ittrue that
he gave you bad reviews
and praisedthe young Von Karajan...
called him a miracle,
said he was betterthan you.
So you had him conscripted
into the army and nowhe's missing?
That's an outrageous lie!
You didn't callyourbuddy and say,
''God in heaven! Didyou see what
Von derNuellwrote aboutme,
the greatest conductor?''
''lwanthim gone.''
''He hadthe nerve to accuse me
ofnotplaying modern music.''
''Send him to Stalingrad.''
ls thatwhatyou did?
You don'tlike criticism, do you?
You didn'tlike hearing
someone was betterthan you.
The name Von derNuell nevercame up
in talks with Goebbels?
Well, once. He said he had read
whatthis man wrote aboutme.
What did he say?
''Don'tmind him. His job is
to criticise, yours is to conduct.''
- Whathappenedto Von derNuell?
- l have no idea.
You reallyhave no idea?
l'lltellyou whathappened.
He died... in Stalingrad.
l'm sorry.
Thatyoung conductor...
What's his name? That Miracle Kid.
You knowwho l mean. Von Karajan!
Butyou called him something else.
What didyou callVon Karajan?
Sayit.
l'll sayitthen, ''Little K''.
ls thatright?
You couldn'tbearto sayhis name.
Stop playing games.
Why you should bring up...
Why you should bring up another
conductoris beyond my understanding.
l'lltellyou why.
We talked about
playingforHitler's birthday
andyou said Goebbels gotto
yourdoctors, you were tricked.
That's true.
l have a different storyto tell.
l don'tthinkyou were tricked.
Notin the way you describe.
lthink something else happened.
l've seen the Hinkel archive
and records ofphone calls,
and putting it alltogether,
this is what lthinkhappened.
lthink Goebbels said,
''lfyou won't conductforAdolf,
we'll getthe Miracle Kid,
the guy Von derNuell
thinks is the greatest conductor.''
''He's notjustwillingto conduct,
he's offeredto sing Happy Birthday.''
Admitit. Kworriedyou, didn'the?
He always worriedyou.
ln 1942, he's 34 years old,
you're already 56.
Goebbels and Goering keep saying,
''lfyou won't do it, Little Kwill.''
Nevermind art and politics
and bullshit aboutliberty,
humanity and justice
because l don't care
howgreatyou are,
that's the oldest storyin the book.
The ageing Romeo
jealous ofthe young buck.
You didn'tleave the country
when you should have because
you were frightenedthat once gone,
you'd be supplanted bythe Miracle
Kid, the Party's boytwice over.
Flashy, talented Little K.
This is absolute nonsense.
Well, l'm justbeginning
to develop mytheme.
Don'tyou saythat
in classical music?
OK, so they played on
yourinsecurity.
That's human, understandable.
But one guy doesn'tlike Little K
as much as he likes you.
The numberone man, yourpal, Adolf.
He thinks you're the greatest.
When he says, ''lwant Wilhelm for
mybirthday'', theybettergetyou.
So Josefthreatens you with K
and it's to hell
with the Ninth in Vienna,
l'll give itto Adolf
forhis birthdayin Berlin.
That's the trickthey played.
They gotyou bythe balls
andthey squeezed hard.
Why didyou stay?
Why didyou playforthem?
Whywere you the flag carrier
fortheirregime?
Jealousy.
Ofcourse, there was a conspiracy
againstme...
Acampaign, even abroad.
Wilhelm, l'm talking about ordinary,
everydayreasons,
which is whywe'll discuss
yourprivate life.
- Do you have illegitimate children?
- Major, l don't see how...
David! David!
What are you?
Counselforthe Defence now?
Didyou hearthe question?
- l have...
- What?
l said l have illegitimate children.
l don'tknowhowmany.
You like the women, don'tyou?
Before every concert,
you got a woman in yourdressing room
and gave her
the old conductor's baton?
- This is offensive!
- You bet!
- And irrelevant!
- Not so, Counsellor!
Yoursecretary
wasn'tjustyoursecretary.
She procuredwomen foryou,
didn't she? As many as you wanted.
- Stop this, please, stop now!
- No, lwon't stop!
Hitlerofferedyou a beautiful house
and bomb shelter.
l refusedthem both.
Butyou see what l'm getting at!
You get a house,
you're highly paid...
What do you do, stay orleave?
stay!
That's not a good argument.
lfDr Furtwanglerdid enjoythese...
..privileges,
itwas ofwho andwhathe is.
- lt's true ofanyleading artist...
- Butit doesn'tmake them saints.
They've still gotto getup and piss
in the middle ofthe night.
They can still be vindictive, envious
and mean justlike you and me.
Well, justlike me.
Can'tthey?
OK, Wilhelm, go home now.
Go home andthink about
these past 12 years.
- l don'tunderstand.
- No, that's yourproblem.
You understand nothing.
We'll callyou. Go.
- Major?
- What?
Yourmanner.
Mymanner?
Why don'tyou go downstairs,
get a cup ofcoffee and calm down?
Now, sir.
What's the matter, Emmi?
What's going on with you?
What's wrong?
l'm sorry...
..but l have to leave.
l'llfind otherwork.
You have to get someone else,
that's all.
Whatis this?
l can't do this. lt's notright.
What's notright?
l've been...
..questioned bythe Gestapo...
..justlike that...
justlike...
justlike you question him.
Emmi, stop.
lwantto showyou something.
Letme showyou andthen
ifyou wantto leave, you can.
Please. Please.
His friends, they didthis.
And he gave them birthday concerts.
Buthe had no idea.
Alot ofpeople had no idea.
l... l only...
..realised
whatwas really going on...
..when l got arrested.
lfhe had no idea,
why didthe Jews need saving?
This is my question, Emmi,
to all Germans.
Why didthe Jews need...
..saving in this country? Why?
lfpeople had no idea?
lwould like to go now, please.
Embraceable You
# l love allthe many charms
aboutyou
# Above all, lwantmy arms aboutyou
# Don'tbe a naughtybaby... #
- Can l askyou a favour, Major?
- Yeah.
When you question him again, could
you treathimwith more respect?
With more what?
More what?
Major, he may justbe the greatest
conductorofthis century
andthatmerits respect.
l don'tunderstand a thing aboutyou.
You're a Jew.Are you a Jew?
Yes, l am a Jew.
Butfirst l'm a human being.
Ahuman being. Good! l'm relieved.
lthoughtyou'd say a music-lover.
This man, this great artist,
has made anti-Semitic remarks like
you wouldn'tbelieve. l've seen...
Showme somebodywho hasn't
and l'll showyou paradise.
Where are you feelings, David?
Where's yourhatred, yourdisgust?
Where's yourfucking outrage, David?
Think ofyourparents
andthen think ofhim conducting
''Happy Birthday, dearAdolf''.
l mean...
ForChrist's sake,
whose side are you on?
Growup.
Just growthe fuck up.
Come backto work.
May l come in?
You can influence whathappens there.
What good can you do byleaving?
lfyou go, you're giving up.
Howwillyou help Furtwanglerorme?
Don'tthink aboutleaving.
Stay.
Everybody says what a great
benefactoryou were to the Jews.
But l have things here you said
andwrote. Listen to this.
''The JewcomposerSchonberg is
admired bythe Jewish lnternational.''
Andwhat aboutthis?
''Jewish musicians lack
a genuine affinitywith ourmusic.''
''Jewish musicians
are good businessmen...
..with fewscruples, lacking roots.''
Do you denythis?
Those attitudes do not existin me.
Just answerthe question -
no explanations.
Speakingto Partymembers,
l usedthe language, ofcourse l did.
Everyone did.
Butit's notme.
Then who is it?
Who was speaking?
Major, maybe we have
to balance those things
againsthis assistance
to his Jewish colleagues.
This is a transcriptfrom Nuremberg.
ASwedish man, Birger Dahlerus,
testified in cross-examination
thathe had metHermann Goering.
''lfirst sawGoering embroiled
in an argumentwith Dr Furtwangler,
who was vainly seeking
to keep his Jewish concertmaster.''
Emmi, pick one ofthese, any one,
and read it out, please.
''Dr Furtwanglerrisked his life
to help anyone who asked him.''
''ltestifyto having seen
hundreds ofpeople
lined up outside his dressing room
afterconcerts to askforhis help.''
''He neverturned anyone away.''
''Afterhe heard me play-
l am a violinist-
he gave me moneybecause
lwas unable to feed myfamily
andthen he helped me to escape.''
''He helped countless others.''
That's only one letter.
Howmanytimes have ltoldyou
lwas in insurance?
You think l can't smell
a phoney policy?
He helped Jews,
thatwas justinsurance, his cover,
because allthe while
he was maestro ofall he surveyed.
See, Wilhelm, lthink
you were theirboy, theircreature.
You were like an advertising slogan.
''This is whatwe produce-
the greatest conductorin the world.''
You went alongwith it.
You didn'tneedto be a Partymember.
l should have asked
notforyour Partynumber,
butforyournon-Partynumber.
Justlike otherwell-known artists.
Emmi, putthe record on.
Do you knowwhatthatis?
Ofcourse l knowwhatitis.
OK, so whatis it?
Bruckner's Seventh.The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
l am.
Do you knowthe lasttime
itwas played on these airwaves?
Howcould l knowsuch a thing?
l'lltellyou, then.
The lasttime this music was played
was afterthey announcedthat
yourpal Hitlerhad shothimself.
Listen to it.
Didthey pick Little K's recording?
Didthey pick some otherconductor?
No, they pickedyou andwhy?
Because you representedthem
so beautifully.
When the devil died
theywanted his bandleader
to conductthe funeral march.
You were everythingto them.
l have always triedto analyse myself
carefully and closely.
Staying here, l believed...
lwalked a tightrope
between exile andthe gallows.
You seem to be blaming me
fornothaving been hanged.
l did not directly oppose the Party.
ltold myselfitwasn'tmy job.
lfltook any active partin politics
l could nothave remained here.
But as a musician,
l am more than a citizen.
l am a citizen ofthis country
in that eternal sense to which...
..to which the genius
ofgreatmusic testifies.
l knowthat a single performance
ofa greatmasterpiece
is a more vital negation
ofthe spirit ofBuchenwald
and Auschwitzthan words.
Have you eversmelled burningflesh?
l smelled itfourmiles away!
Fourmiles away, l smelled it!
Have you everseen the gas chambers?
The crematoria?
Have you seen the mounds
ofrotting corpses?
You talkto me about culture,
art and music?
Are you puttingthatin the scales?
Are you setting culture,
art and music
againstthe millions
putto death by yourpals?
Theyhad orchestras in the camps!
They played Beethoven, Wagner!
The hangmen... played chambermusic
athome with theirfamilies.
l don'tunderstandthe German's
relationship with music.Whymusic?
Yourpals you could call
to save a fewJews
when millions were being annihilated?
Yes!
l blame you fornot getting hanged!
l blame you foryourcowardice!
You strutted and swaggered,
you fucking piece ofshit.
Kingpin in a shithouse.
You talkto me
aboutwalking a tightrope
between exile andthe gallows,
and l sayto you, lies!
l believe in music, what could l do?
Look aroundyou!
See the country you served!
Look atpeople who had real courage,
who tookrisks!
Who riskedtheirlives!
Like Emmi's father.
Emmi. Emmi,
take yourfingers out ofyourears.
l'm talking aboutyourfather.
Myfatheronly joinedthe plot
when he realised
thatwe could notwin the war.
Whatkind ofa world do you want?
Whatkind ofworldwillyou make?
Do you honestlybelieve thatthe only
realityis the materialworld?
lfso, you will be leftwith nothing.
Nothing butfeculence.
Feculence more foul
than thatwhich pervades yournights.
Howwas lto understand? Howwas l
to knowwhattheywere capable of?
No one knew.
l don'twantto stayin this country.
Yes, l should have leftin 1934.
ltwould have been better
ifl'd left.
Gethim out ofhere.
Thankyou, Fraulein.
You have been mostkind.
Sons ofbitches.
MajorArnold. Getme GeneralWallace.
General? About Furtwangler.
l don'tknow
ifthe case will stand up...
SymphonyNo. 5 in C Minor

Nevermind. Ourjournalist
will do whatwe tell him.
BEETHOVEN'S SYMPHONYNO. 5
ECHOES lN THE DlSTANCE
Turn it off!
We handedWilhelm Furtwangler
overto the authorities.
He was charged
with servingthe Nazi regime,
with uttering anti-Semitic slurs,
performing
at an official Nazi Partyfunction
andwith being
a Prussian Privy Councillor.
Dr Furtwanglerwas acquitted.
l didn'tnail him.
But l sure winged him.
And l knowl didthe rightthing.
Furtwanglerresumed his career,
buthe was neverallowed
to conductin the United States.
He died in 1954.
Little Ksucceeded him
as head ofthe Berlin Philharmonic.
