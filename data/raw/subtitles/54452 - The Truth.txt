THE TRUTH
Brichet! Court today!
Her and her bloody doors!
Marceau! Court today!
You've a hard day ahead of you
Go to hell!
All yours!
Leave her alone; you know
she's up for trial today
She's your pet, but I'm no thief or killer
I know; you're here for
being so kind-hearted
- We'll all suffocate here
- They're opening up at the back
My apologies, Madame
Would you open it?
I'll have to ask the chief
I'll be responsible
Thank you so much. I
couldn't see from back there
Of course, you lawyers
must find it all very boring
Not till our facilities fail
What a ham Eparvier is
Mainstay of the grieving mother
She nearly fainted outside
Eparvier probably tipped off a photographer
- Where were you?
- With our client
Leaving me to rescue Madame Boutereau
She means five million a year to us.
Rather more than this Dominique Marceau
- What did she say?
- She still wants to explain
She'll see reason in the dock, they all do
- I doubt if she will
- Then we're in for it
It's a great profession,
apart from the clients
- Doesn't look too tarty, does she?
- No, but she's still a looker
That's bad; see the jurors?
Object to those women
Happy with my paper today?
What faces! Just what I need
Who's for it today? Witnesses? Accused?
I give everybody a hard time,
especially with him on the other side
Demand the maximum penalty,
you'll get it if you press
What's up your sleeve?
I thought you told me they didn't get on
Wait and see
Name, age and profession
Dominique Marceau, twenty-two years old
Profession?
Clerk, proceed with the selection of the jury
The preliminaries will take an hour
Waiting and more waiting It gets on my nerves
Try to relax, you'll need
all your nerve soon enough
I draw lots for the jury
First juror. Monsieur Verdier, number seven
- Madame Tardy
- Objection
- Madame Galon
- Objection
- The shysters!
- You're young
What do you make of her?
A bitch. Premeditated murder, obviously
If Guerin wins, she'll get five
years and be out in eighteen months
It's a gift
Eparvier doesn't give, he could make it life
Or worse
That's tomorrow's story,
first we must write today's
Kindly vacate the benches for observers
The jury will rise
Swear before God to examine
most carefully the charges
Prejudice neither the accused's
interests nor the state's
Communicate with no one until
your verdict is delivered
Entertain no malice, decide
according to your conscience...
...with impartiality, as
benefits free, honest men...
...and thereafter remain
silent as to your deliberations
Let the accused...
...hear the charges
The Clerk will read the commission for trial
On 15th October, 1959, the
Indictments Office of Paris...
...in pursuance of the charges
against Dominique Morceau...
With a girl like that,
truth may be the best defence
What truth?
That this case is about a couple of kids
I'm not going to come a cropper
to please that little ninny
My line is that Gilbert was
a rat, determined to have her
He turned her head...
...but once she saw through
him, she pulled the trigger,
The old story
Invariably
On 15th December, 1958, the
police received a call...
...from Andre Mortineou.
a friend of Gilbert Tellier
Martineau had already warned
Tellier of possible danger
Don't practise too late, the
neighbours have complained
Has Monsieur Tellier gone out?
No, a blonde visited him
Have you a key?
What a smell of gas
An accident?
I'll turn off the gas
She's here! Call the police
I'd let her croak
- She's pretty far gone
- Are we doing her a favour?
She wouldn't suffer
Very convenient
Dominique Morceau has
been committed for trial...
...at the Seine Court of Assizes...
...and ordered to be held in custody...
...to await judgement according to the law
Stand
You are, therefore, accused of murder...
...and may suffer penalty of death
Proceed with the examination
Born 12th October, 1939, in Rennes,
where you lived until eighteen
Your father being on active service...
...your mother raised
you and your sister, Annie
Character witnesses all
offer the some testimony
Selfishness, instability,
sullenness, ingratitude at home
Yet you led a pampered, happy life
Yes, but I was...
Mistreated?
No, it was dreary
She was always the good one
From childhood you hated her
I have here an account of a typical incidents
Your sister was given a beautiful doll
You stole this doll and tore out its hair...
...poked out its eyes...
...and dismembered it with alarming ferocity
Murdering a doll! Well, well!
Counsel, please!
I was eight
Already jealous of your sister
No one gave me anything
Because you didn't deserve
it, but Annie worked hard
She found learning things easy I didn't
You never took pains, unlike your sister
Gentlemen, Annie worked at her
lessons and learnt the violin
You roamed the street with
boys, scandalizing the town
That's easy to do in Rennes
By bringing a scandalous book
like The Mandarins to school?
We passed it around, but
it was pretty boring stuff
Didn't it surprise or shock you?
Your Honour, a page at random page 74
His lips teased my breast,
my stomach, moved lower...
I succumbed to pleasure...
Your Honour, three carefully
chosen lines out of 600 pages
- Aren't they in the book?
- It won the Goncourt Prize!
Would you give it to your daughter?
Is Simone de Beauvoir on trial here?
We are not here to censure
you for your reading
I'm glad to hear it
But this episode caused
your expulsion from school
More idle then ever, you paid no
heed to your father, now retired
You frequented cafes, went to
the cinema three times a week
Soon this life of dissipation
had a logical consequence:
you took a lover
I told the magistrate that
You did indeed. Strange
that the young man denies it
Poor Henri
It's usually the other way round.
However, the man is now married
People started talking, you
left to escape the consequences
What consequences? That
had nothing to do with it
Annie was going to the Paris
Conservatory. I seized my chance
If Annie's going, why shouldn't I?
I might as well drop dead.
Don't talk like that
Your hands are all thumbs
As for your brain...
- I'll be a secretary
- You can't type
There are shops, beauty parlours...
A manicurist? No daughter of mine!
- What's to become of me?
- What indeed?
I'd be earning sooner than
Annie if I was a beautician
I'd pay you back for the trip after a month
I'll go anyway
And I'll box your ears!
You'll regret it!
Excellent stew
Good night, dear. Go straight to bed
You'd have got your way if
you'd played your cards right
You're not asleep
Don't be silly, it's not my fault
Don't be ridiculous
That's enough!
Dominique, answer me! Say something!
You weren't serious, were you?
Wanting to die is serious
But your motives are in doubt
- It was an act
- A farce!
You call that a farce?
I call it a tragedy when an
eighteen-year- old takes Veronal!
The doctor described the
suicide attempt as theatrical
Theatrical, but not faked I quote:
The patient was semi-comatose
It was a lethal dose
If you quote, please quote in full
... a lethal dose, but the
patient was in no danger
I'm waiting. Aren't you going to read it all?
I will, then
... the patient was in no danger...
... thanks to prompt medical intervention
lmplying: "because I arrived in time"
She counted on it
Neither doctor nor parents
doubted her sincerity
The proof is that they let her have her way
Your parents made the
sacrifice and sent you to Pans
La Chapelle; an hour from town
A remote suburb, but clean and wholesome...
... where you found cheap
but comfortable lodgings
Will you be long?
Can't you help me?
Some comfort this is!
Happy scraping!
The easy life tempted you
You were dazzled by the
glitter of Parisian life...
... the lure of shop windows
Not for long
No, you soon quit the
Champs-Elysees for the Left Bank
But not in search of learning
or more studious companions
You discovered the cafe
life of the Latin Quarter...
... the physical and mental
abandon, the unsavoury atmosphere...
...and the false camaraderie
This promiscuity seemed to offer fulfilment
The crudest advances didn't offend you
Far from being shocked, you
felt at home with such depravity
You flourished, made friends...
... found your milieu
You returned there day after day...
... meeting others like
yourself, whom you call "the gang"
Get lost
My own room's freezing
- Who's standing treat?
- Be my guest
Such generosity; I'll make a note
You're in his novel
- And there it'll stay
- The idea's the thing
What's it about?
My work? It's about life
- A big subject
- You've said it!
- Cant you shut up?
- I'm looking for a beat
- After studying music all day!
- I'm no good at music
You play?
I'd rather drop dead!
What do you do, then? It's for my novel
I don't do anything much
So you broke your promise to your parents
What promise?
Weren't you going to work to pay your way?
What does that mean?
I attended a course for beauticians
For one week
I'm not my best in the mornings
So your lazy and licentious
habits led you to crime
To escape your sister's
good example. you stayed out
- Do you ever think of suicide?
- Of course. Everyone does
Me, too, whenever I take the Metro
I don't want to go home
What are you going to do, then?
I could stay with you
I warn you. it's very small. The bed. too
- Hello, Daisy
- Does she live here?
Got a light, Michel?
Lovely stain, isn't it?
And how do you like my mobile?
- It's something to look at
- Barbaste made it for me
- Barbe who?
- You don't know him
What's this rope?
It's what we were talking about: a noose
- Will you use it soon?
- There's no hurry
I think hanging's an ugly method
- We'll be squashed up I can sleep anywhere
- Don't you work in the evening?
- I never work, I think
Funny, we don't say much, but we get on OK
All these rockets will end up in fireworks
You're sweet. Do you want to?
Just as friends
Maybe we get along because
we aren't capable of loving
I'm fed up!
Washing in the basin, stockings on
my music stand, jam on my Mozart!
Sleep around if you like,
but don't mess up this place!
You pinch my cologne, throw the soap around
You don't wash that often
And now the sugar's gone
I finished it
Couldn't you buy some? You've
plenty of time to go shopping
Take it easy
It's early closing. Without
me, you'd die of hunger
Of joy, you mean
I'm looking for Annie Marceau
She's just gone out
You can wait here, she won't be long
You can come closer. I don't bite
Are you Dominique? I'm Gilbert Tellier
I heard your record, I
thought I had the wrong door
It's not Annie's scene. She's a square
- Me, too
- No kidding!
I can't stand your sort of music
It sends me
Hasn't Annie mentioned me?
No, the hypocrite. Are you a violinist, too?
No, piano, organ and
composition. And now, conducting
Being a soloist is fine, of course...
...but one serves music best by conducting
- I'm boring you
- No, it's interesting
Do you see Annie often? Have you screwed yet?
Don't talk like that! Annie's a nice girl
So what are you waiting
for? It might make her nicer
She's fine as she is, a wonderful friend
We go to concerts and we work together
It must be a riot
But there's more to life than fooling around
Enough of your high principles.
You're made for each other
I've seats for the concert:
Markevitch conducting Bartok
See you in the foyer
You've gone too for! I put
up with it when we're alone...
...but in front of my friends...
What will he think? I'm ashamed of you
All for that pompous fool
I like that! He's the most
gifted student in the school
Here we go again!
No, that was the last straw
You won't find me here when you get back!
Fine!
Casting all respectability aside,
you joined your lover, Michel Delaunay
Wasn't Michel Delaunay your lover?
Didn't he live at the Hotel Boileau?
You lived there, therefore you went to him
No, I lived in Daisy's room
We shared the rent. As for Michel...
...that was long over
You became his mistress
only a week previously
Something like that
You'd parted already?
What happened?
It was over, that's all
You still saw him
I saw him before, I saw him after What of it?
It's beyond my comprehension
According to you, Gilbert
arrived at the hotel one day...
...quite unexpectedly
Annie had sent him
She denies that
Something wrong?
No, but is everything all
right now with your sister?
Yes, she's living with her
gang at the Hotel Boileau
- Do you care?
- No, but it was my fault
If she does anything foolish,
I'll feel sort of responsible
Forget about it
It's wonder-boy
More like this
- What brings you here?
- I'd like a word with you
I think he wants a word in private
Very discreet, your friends
A virtue I practise on occasion. Exeunt
Are you smoking pot?
I'm burning incense. I hate
draughts, so I keep the window closed
Don't put yourself out, do you?
No. Is that what you came to tell me?
Your sister sent me, she's worried about you
Couldn't she come?
Afraid of meeting your lover, perhaps
Michel? Not any more
He seems to be in close attendance
We don't do much now, we
play footsy. I like that
And he likes my breasts, but that's all
If you think you shock me...
What do I do, then?
You interest me, you're a rather amusing case
You think I'm an easy lay? I must get dressed
Already? It's only half past three
I'm starving. With bores,
all you can do is eat
Does every guy you meet want
to sleep with you right away?
Right away?
It would be simplest, wouldn't it?
You're not the type
You detest me, don't you?
Less so now, can I have the one with cheese?
Two, even
He's loaded, he gives
piano lessons to rich kids
Three of them
And your cold cuts?
He means I play the organ at funerals
He feeds off human misery
Good luck! I do baby-sitting
Mother goes to the pictures
and I change their nappies
Where did you get that fantastic shirt?
From a grateful girl
No, talented. A free sample
He is gifted
You're impossible
- Why are you here, then?
- He's in love, obviously
It doesn't suit him
You love being handled
He's jealous, poor thing
Are you free tonight?
No, not tonight
No, there's no one with me
I'm going to see a film
with a guy All right, then!
Who are you going to see a film with?
With a nutcase
You're a stuffed-shirt, but you're sweet
Can I come in?
Daisy will be there
Don't you like the idea?
It's just that you're so
serious, it's different
I love you, in spite of all
your faults, is that bad?
No, I like everything.
I like being loved, too
Prove it
Come in. Just in the nick of time
I get the idea
How long will you make him dance?
I don't know, I'm playing it by ear
You refused him for two weeks
To make yourself more desirable?
A ruling. Your Honour
After what period of time
may a girl give herself?
Three days is too short, too easy
Two weeks is too long, too provocative
Is there any precedent in law?
Allow your client to reply
Mademoiselle, you are not exactly virginal
Why did you put off the only
man you claim to have loved?
I felt it should be different with him
So that's why
A self-imposed celibacy
for your great love...
...a sort of engagement
That's right
No, you know very well what I'm driving at
Can't you look where you're going?
- Business is good, eh?
- Better than studying
How about a ride round the block?
He's crazy
- You fancy his bike
- He's not bad, either
You make me sick
Jealous
Forget it. They all fall for such things
Can't you stop that row?
Can't we have some fun?
I have to get up early in the morning
Go to bed earlier, it'll sweeten your temper
In three seconds you'll hear them
Twenty eight, twenty nine...
What are they up to?
- Let's go, it's pointless
- Fancy going off with such a drip!
- We've been jilted
- An accident?
Not the fatal sort
And you didn't die
Was it right to betray Gilbert?
But I wasn't his mistress
So there was no question of engagement
Why not say: "I enjoyed
teasing a timid lover"?
It's not true. I just felt like
going for a ride with Louviers
You became lovers on the bike?
It's easy to poke fun
Despicable, too. You're here to
defend the deceased's memory...
...not to conduct the prosecution
don't forget you're a lawyer
I merely wish to establish the truth
This is my examination
To get back to Louviers...
It meant nothing
Perhaps it did to Gilbert
There you are!
I wondered where you were
If you want to sleep with a
girl, running after her is no good
If I were you I'd get drunk
You're probably right
Where have you been?
Only that I've waited all night
- That's your affair
- We'll see. Get in
- Are you mad?
- I've a wedding at eleven
In bed?
Was it good?
Are you going to work through
the whole list of them?
Slut!
I'm not sorry I came along, it's nice
- We said no. It's nicer this way
- What do you take me for?
You want to be added to the list? Come on!
Come on, then it'll be over and done with
Get up, Daisy, we need the bed
Good morning, anyway
Warmed and ready
It's me! Do you think I
might be allowed in my room?
Not now. Later
You know... I'd never have believed it
Me, neither
It's almost ready. What's
the matter with you?
I think I'm in love
- Can one go in?
- If you keep quiet
Annie, can't you count?
The horns are weak
Not bad at all, but still a little tense
I haven't finished yet
Keep a stronger rein on the
orchestra, or it will run away
See your sister? Gilbert's a fast worker
I didn't know you were so fond of music
Forgive me. Annie...
Bitch! You're worse than I thought
Try to understand
I do! You're quite disgusting! Good luck!
You were wonderful
Annie looks furious
She's upset, of course
How silly of her. Poor Annie
Women are so complicated
Have you got a handkerchief? I'm drenched
Nothing smaller?
We haven't seen much of you lately
I've been rather busy
So I see. Well, we've been
discussing your project
I think it'll work. You can
count on thirty of the best lads
I've been trying to convince them for weeks
Well, now you've done it
Hear that? They have faith
in me to form an orchestra
I'll have my own orchestra
It's a funny feeling
Before, I wasn't sure, I was nervous
Now I'm quite confident
Marvellous, isn't it?
I feel at home here. I can breathe
Some days everything goes right
You are so beautiful
I can't live without you
any longer. We'll get married
So soon? At twenty?
We'll have all the longer to be happy
I thought of you all
night, I didn't sleep a wink
I'll never let you go again
You're mine, no matter what
I'm trying to understand your feelings
Didn't you go to the
Conservatory to taunt your sister?
All I wanted was to see Gilbert
Yet you refused his offer of marriage
I didn't. All I was thinking
about was being happy
Isn't happiness compatible
with respectability?
Is marriage so respectable?
Perhaps not to you, but when
Gilbert asked for your hand...
...he seemed to think so
He never asked formally
He dazzled her with the idea...
...when he was penniless
and knew she couldn't accept
Was Gilbert sincere that day, or wasn't he?
- I'm asking your client
- I forbid her to answer
- Very prudent
- I'm an old hand
Naturally she believed
Gilbert, or she wouldn't be here
That proves her credulity,
not that Gilbert was sincere
A question for your client...
...although I know she won't answer
Did Gilbert tell her of his
intention? Introduce Dominique?
But he did tell his landlady he was engaged
But that was just so we
could be together at his place
- Hear that?
- I'm not deaf
Listen, the first entrance
See what he conjures out of nothing?
Got a film magazine?
But this is Bach, my darling
I like reading while I listen
You're just being difficult
What really gets you?
Marlon Brando
Three rotten shows in two weeks is enough
What shall we do, then?
Go home
Don't you love me any more?
That's all you think of!
I'm a person, too, you know
Of course you are
Yes, in bed. There's more to life than that
I want to go out, have
fun. see my friends, dance
I've seen no one since
you fell in love with me
I've no time to waste with your
friends. I've too much work to do
I've fallen behind over the weeks
Love is two people
Between your music and
your mattress. I'm stifling
Get some air, then
You don't have to say it
twice. I'm off right now
See you tomorrow
Who do you think you are?
I didn't chase you. I'm leaving for good
I don't know where she is
She left in a huff three days ago
It was silly, I know,
but that was no reason...
...especially on an anniversary
two months, I'd bought a present
So had I
She's here now, Daisy
Who were you with for the last three days?
The gang, as usual
Stop pretending. Look in the mirror
What about that shirt?
Where did you get that shirt? I recognize it
Everyone knows it's Jerome's. So what?
So what?
You're mad! Stop it! You're hurting me!
I'm sick of this!
So am I. I never want to
see you again, you slut!
A dreadful scene, her screams
would have woken the dead
I told poor Gilbert this couldn't go on...
...and she wasn't to come again
He understood, he didn't argue
- Anything more?
- I don't think so
Prosecution, any questions?
Do you know the reason
for such violent scenes?
Her constant infidelity
A good-for-nothing.
Why?
How should I know?
Infidelity with all comers is a way of life
But when a faithful woman lapses
once, there must be a reason
A moment of weakness? Did you lose your head?
Over Jerome?
It was silly. We were in my room
I tried on his shirt and wouldn't
give it back. We fought and...
- You kept the shirt?
- He could hardly refuse
Did other shirts follow?
What do you think I am?
A liar. You never loved Gilbert
That explains your constant infidelity
Constant? Only this one
miserable instance has emerged...
...and she volunteered it,
she led a free and easy life
But is she being tried
for that or for murder?
Stop pleading crime passionel
and I'll renounce my brief
She flouted Gilbert's love too
often to play the injured party
Gilbert's love...
Let's talk about Gilbert's love
You said you gave Gilbert a
choice: Dominique or the flat?
That's right
- He chose the flat
- But didn't stop seeing her
He saw her only on the sly
- For what he wanted
- There we agree! Thank you!
Next witness
Ludovic Toussaint. thirty, restaurant owner
You are not related to
the accused, your employee
You swear to tell the whole
truth. Raise your right hand
Give your testimony
How did you meet the accused?
She wanted work. Her father had cut her off
Parents ditch you when
they've had enough of you
I must do something
It's not her fault and I love her for it
It won't feed her
The man should keep her
I hope to later on, but meantime...
- Confectioner seeks salesgirl
- References required
Under-presser
- What's that?
- They'll explain
Salesgirl, lingerie,
Champs-Elysees, good appearance
Qualified... specialized... e xperienced...
Attractive girl wanted as cloakroom attendant
I'm serious, my girl's ill
- What place is it?
- The Sputnik
We'll let you know
- What's wrong?
- I forbid you to accept
Gorgeous shoes! Fantastic diamonds!
Some diamonds, for 8.500 francs!
What a way to live
Earning money without getting
up early? It's terrific
I work by day, we never see each other
If you like it that way
It's freezing outside
If I get a chill, will you nurse me?
I think I'm feverish already
- You find that funny?
- I like getting lips
- Charming!
- What's wrong?
You stringing the customers along
Two hundred francs buys
a smile. It's disgusting
What will five hundred buy me?
Whatever you like
What I'd really like is to clout you
Your friend's getting on my nerves
A packet of Camels
- Where do you live?
- Rue Antoine Dubois
She'll go far, that girl
- Is that necessary?
- Don't you like it?
It's not that I don't
like it, but I love Gilbert
For real?
Anyhow, I'm more than a little tied up myself
Stop spoiling our one free evening together
Our life together is spoiled anyway
- Because of where I work?
- Not only that, it's you, too
What about yesterday?
I'm twenty and I love dancing
- Not with me
- You can't
You really want me to?
We'll go to a great place tonight
Not tonight; I'm rehearsing
You do it on purpose
First your grant, then your
mother, now you're rehearsing
The hall is free
So am I. Choose
I can't
Forty people depend on
me. You must understand
Just one evening
I haven't the right
I don't care if we stay here
till four in the morning!
You've caught cold
The hall was freezing.
They rehearsed till three
- You should have left
- Gilbert would have yelled
I couldn't, anyway, he's so
happy when he's conducting
All he cares about is himself, he's ambitious
No, he's nice. Sometimes I
forgot everything, just listening
- You were asleep
- You think I'm stupid
I like serious music sometimes. you know
If he's busy next Tuesday, I'll take you out
- strictly platonic
Saint-Eustache. The Mass in D
It can't have flown away
You lost it here?
It's not in the hotel
I've looked everywhere It can only be here
How do you know?
Because I do! Don't get in my way
Look everywhere. We must find it
Lost something?
I look as though I'm blind in one foot
- Looked in the sawdust?
- I've swept everywhere
Is Dominique here?
Come and look
Guess where I found it
On the pavement outside
She's so lucky
What are you doing here?
Adding the boss to your collection?
You're
Don't be a fool
You've both made a fool of me, haven't you?
- A lift one night...
- Every night!
- So what?
- Who cares?
I ought to punch you,
but I don't care any more
I swear I've done nothing wrong. I love you
You're lying, as always
Don't look at me like that
I shall. And I see you as you are
You're wrong. Let me explain
I'm finished with you
I certainly can. I'm free!
Free and glad of it. So
good night and thanks!
You've got it all wrong, Gilbert
You really mean it?
Yes, I'm tired of your stories
I'm fed up, too. If you
want to leave me, leave me!
The bastard!
- Where shall we go?
- Anywhere. I'll show him!
- Saint-Eustache? -
Yes, let's go there
But you didn't go, did you?
No, I look Dominique to
Montmartre for a nightcap
You ended up at the Hotel Radio
Was she reconciled to the break?
No, she wanted revenge. I
shouldn't have... but I obliged
You jumped at the opportunity
However, your employees
say you were lovers before
That's untrue
I'll get him
This sudden affair ended there?
You didn't try to see her again?
I phoned, but was always told she was ill
Later on she returned to The Sputnik
- And after that?
- I saw her around
Prosecution, any questions?
When she was in your employ, would
you say she was truly in love?
I'm sure she worshipped Gilbert
- There were quarrels
- Gilbert was to blame
- For no reason?
- He always found one
An over-generous tip, a joke, a smile
He even reproached her for working at night
- He could have changed that
- Perhaps he lacked means
Still, he could have helped her
If she needed shoes, she
starved for a week to buy them
For the first time...
...we hear of a mean,
unjust Gilbert Tellier...
...and a faithful, loving Dominique Marceau
Your relations with the accused
explain but do not excuse your attitude
On a point of detail
Did you tell the police of
your visit to the Hotel Radio?
No, I didn't think it mattered
What I'm getting at is
that you saw it mattered...
...when you were confronted
with the hotel register
You say: "She wasn't my mistress
until Gilbert broke with her"
I wonder if that is true, or
whether "it didn't matter"?
You're beneath contempt
Still, I'm looking down on you
Let's consider this "friendship"
You offer a lovely, penniless girl
a job. You don't expect any reward?
I don't exploit people
Yet later you asked her, in a
"friendly" way, to be your mistress
She refused; I wasn't angry
On the contrary, you became even friendlier
Gilbert makes more scenes at The Sputnik
You ignore them, friendly like...
...and drive off with the accused
in the early hours, as friends
She was tired. I drove her home
Do you drive all your staff home?
It was on my way
And, anyway, you were friends.
Why keep it from Gilbert?
He might have misunderstood
No doubt. So he had no
reason to suspect you...
...yet one morning he's lurking
outside The Sputnik; in jest, no doubt
Then he breaks with her
- For no reason, it seems
- I've answered on oath
Where you're concerned, an oath...
Ludovic Toussaint, age thirty. That is you?
Previous oath: I solemnly declare
I never had sexual relations...
... with Dominique Marceau, before
or after her break with Tellier
That is the honest truth
The honest truth, on oath. It was a lie
You understand...
We all understand you, sir
The defence
Shall we forget the
rhetoric and reason this out?
My colleague says your affair
with Dominique began earlier
In that case, would she have broken
with you and Gilbert simultaneously?
Of course not
She broke with you, regretting
having gone with you in pique
Remorseful, the next day
she locks herself in her room
She says nothing to Gilbert?
She wants to see him,
but doesn't dare call him
She has a guilty conscience,
she doesn't know what to do
Still in bed?
I think it's flu
But nervous breakdowns are expensive
- Where are your coats?
- I sold everything
It's holiday time...
... but Dominique stays put
Daisy is in America, a
foreigner has replaced her
For two months I've paid the
rent I'd like you to stay, but...
Keep my trunk, I shan't need it
Have a roll and coffee a small one
- How are you?
- Not too good
You look all in
It looks as though I'll have to
sleep at the station again tonight
Nothing doing at my place
- What about your place?
- You're a nuisance
You can stay tonight, but
find another sucker tomorrow
Go to hell!
You're going about it all wrong
Do you like sleeping rough?
Look, see that man with glasses?
He's a Yank
He's come to Paris for a good
time; room with bath, probably
You're dressed up. How was your Yank?
I've just seen him off
- It didn't last long
- Four days were enough
- Where were you?
- At the Mondova
We looked everywhere for you;
your father's had an accident
The undertaker should have removed everything
It looks as if there's been a hurricane
Go and rest; I'll tidy up
It's so unjust, but I'll bear up
My poor Marcel, what shall I do without him?
You managed well enough without him for years
When I married an officer...
...I didn't think of wars
You're not to blame
That's all I need
Don't be sad; I'm here
You're my one comfort
And now you're getting married
Not right away
Anyway, you'll visit us often
Annie's engaged?
You're engaged?
To Gilbert Tellier
Congratulations
They'll make music together
and be happy ever after
Art unites wonder-boy
and super-girl
It's gold medal stuff
But he doesn't love her, he can't possibly
What's it to you?
Your eyes are puffy
I cried all night
For Gilbert?
No, because I've aged
All of a sudden?
Yes, from girl to hag
You've started thinking? Since when?
- In the train from Rennes
- Trains do that to you
I'm more part of your youth than that creep
You never did understand him
It took me longer. You classified
him at once as a pompous fool
- I said that?
- You slated him
Where? When? I suppose
you know better than me?
I'm a liar, but I've an excellent memory
- Didn't I love Gilbert?
- And Louviers?
I'd forgotten him, which proves
that only Gilbert mattered
Are you kidding?
Dominique was sincere
...not one of those housewives
juggling husband and lover...
...who moralizes about others
Don't digress
Another flop
Dominique is here because she
rejected hypocritical conventions
You're older; you wouldn't understand
We're different
Young people should judge her
Little oaf
Please, I'm asking the questions
The witness has a literary conception
We may not understand young
people, but we do speak French
You claim that Dominique was sincere...
...and in despair over Gilbert
after her father's funeral?
Yes I realized she had
never stopped loving him
- Prosecution?
- No questions
Perhaps I fail to appreciate
the literary mind...
...but I don't understand,
so I require clarification
Am I right in thinking you're intelligent?
Good, perhaps you will explain
You've just said you realized
she had never stopped loving him
But to never stop loving,
one must have loved, right?
Did it seem like love at
first sight between them?
Not immediately. Later
When? Let me help you
When she withheld herself?
When she went off with Louviers?
When she made a fool of him with
Ludovic? When she broke with him?
When she forgot her despair
and turned to prostitution?
But she came back
When she discovered he was
marrying the sister she hated
Hated? They didn't get on, that's all
If Dominique loved Gilbert,
it doesn't make sense
After meeting him, she
calls him a pompous fool
Then three lovers in succession;
odd for a woman in love
Then the break-up
A woman in love would do her
utmost to see Gilbert again
Strange she didn't
She frittered away six months;
six months of idleness...
...of debauchery...
...of silence
Suddenly she can't live without him;
she obtains a gun and rushes there
It makes no sense
But if Dominique hated her
sister, if she was determined...
...to take Gilbert from her that I understand
When they first met...
...she was lounging in
bed, flaunting her nudity
All she wanted was to lake him from Annie
It's obvious
She plays him on a string, and only yields...
...when he looks like turning back to Annie
Hurriedly dressing, she scurries
to the Conservatory. And why?
To present Annie with an accomplished fact
This seems to have put paid to Annie
But why keep on with Gilbert? He bores her
She deceives him, she
leaves him, she forgets him
It's quite clear
Suddenly, a revelation:
Gilbert is reconciled with Annie
He is forgiven: they're
engaged. Dominique looks on...
...powerless against their happiness
But there is still a way
She takes it
I'm probably very stupid and
haven't your flair for drama
"But I don't understand..." et cetera
You want the witness's opinion
of this bundle of hypotheses?
As he says, it's idiotic.
Now to serious matters
Was it Dominique who made the first advances?
No, Gilbert ran after her
- Why was he so ardent?
- He wanted to sleep with her
Once he got what he wanted,
was he attentive to her?
He kept her in purdah
So this flighty Dominique
we've heard so much about...
...gave up everything for
this self-centred careerist
She stuck to him, despite
the boredom and the sermons
Even the violence, as
we've heard. To what end?
He gave her nothing
She loved him, obviously
After they parted, who broke down? Him?
He was too busy...
...but you saw how miserable she was
She moped about all day...
...stunned
I was waiting for him;
he couldn't have forgotten
I didn't dare tell anyone.
Say you understand, Michel!
Well prompted
Why do you never believe me?
I should know; I spent
nights crying my eyes out
So you say, but it is hard to believe
Why should you cherish such a wild hope?
His notebook
There has been no mention
of a notebook before
Gilbert Tellier Ensemble seeks
oboist and bass-player for tour
He's moved. He thinks he's made it
He thinks he's Toscanini, the big-head
And your big head? Lend me a pencil
Who's calling?
Speak, for heaven's sake!
Do you know what time it is?
Three o'clock
A social call in the middle
of the night? For nothing?
Let me come in, just for a moment
Well, what's wrong?
I said: nothing. I just
wanted to see you. Hear you
So you have. Well?
Don't you understand? I love you
I feel wonderful with
you. I've been so unhappy
Forgive me for disturbing
you, for being what I am
Forgive me for everything, for the past...
- It's not true!
- Lying, amoral...
Shameless, indecent...
Thank you for being what you
are. Thank you for coming here
Please hurry up. I'm late
Sorry, I didn't know
I keep telling you
I'll be ready in three minutes
Shall we meet here tonight?
Not here. Not anywhere
It's not because of her, is it?
Nothing so simple
I've put up with a lot because of you
That night with Ludovic...
I thought I'd die
I flung myself into my work
I forgot you, slowly; but
something still remained
As though I were hoping
for what happened last night
Now I see clearly
You don't love me
I think I never did
I can't help it. I'm sorry
It's not as bad as all that
It's not the end of the world
I'd hate to have hurt a pretty girl like you
I need your name and address for my report
Listen carefully, Madame
The accused maintains she visited
your tenant on 9th December...
...and stayed from 3 a.m. to about 10 a.m.
Untrue
This is important
lf, as the accused says, she
was welcomed by the victim...
...who proved his affection
before sending her away...
...an element of passion might be admissible
If not, the case will
appear in a different light
Consider carefully: could you be mistaken?
I'm positive
The door is automatic?
Yes. People say who they
are, otherwise I come out
You are sure you weren't asleep,
or distracted momentarily?
It's never happened in ten years
And you didn't see the
accused leave in the morning?
Definitely not. A neighbour
does my shopping for me
I never leave my post...
...for a moment
You needn't look like that I'm a honest woman
So much so, it makes me wonder
Explain yourself
I'll leave that for later
The bus driver, you mean?
We're coming to that
The morning you didn't see
Dominique leave your building...
...a witness nearly ran her
down in rue Docteur Barbier
His official report was as follows:
On 9th December at 10.47 a.m.
outside 3 rue Docteur Barbier...
... a young woman was almost... et cetera
You know what it means?
It is incontestable...
...that the accused was
outside number three at 10.47
Her claim to have left number
nine shortly before seems plausible
No one escapes your watchful eye?
Nothing can tear you away.
You sleep with one eye open.
It's my job
I was curious enough to
have this fortress visited...
...by an officer of the court,
accompanied by my colleague
Here is his rather surprising report...
...on this open-plan fortress
On 28th November...
... we arrive at 10 a.
m. the concierge is not in
Her office is closed
7 th January, at 9.30 a. m.
we find a note on her door:
"Back in a minute"
No tenant was able to inform us...
... when the concierge returned
6th March...
...3 a.m.
The door opens automatically;
we do not identify ourselves
It takes us some time
to find the light switch
We walk up to the sixth floor, then walk down
We leave without being challenged
What cheek!
I regret we were not informed
I'm surprised you didn't
think of doing it yourself
The crime squad is at your disposal
I must stress the discretionary
nature of these proceedings
We cannot draw hasty
conclusions from this evidence
It merely proves that
Dominique entered the street
Anything else is simply hypothesis
Anything which upset the
Prosecution is "hypothesis"
The Prosecutor has been
forbearing in his choice of phrase
Your client's shameless
lying is hardly a hypothesis
On 9th December, the day after
this supposed night of love...
...Gilbert had a date with
Annie; we know where they went
We went to publish the banns
I'll clear the court if
there's any disturbance
We'd meant to do it before,
but Gilbert was so busy
He was rehearsing for television;
he was tired and worried
Then, that morning, he come rushing in
He clasped me in his arms
He said: "My darling, we've waited too long
"You were made for me;
we'll grow old together"
Now it's all over. Why did you do it?
I didn't mean to. I loved him
What do you know about love?
I'd give my life...
Your conduct is intolerable
You must control your
grief and be quite candid
Did Gilbert give any hint that
he had seen the accused again?
No. He hid nothing from me
He wouldn't tell you that
I swear he took me in
his arms like he used to
It's not true! Gilbert said
it was all over between them
"I'm happy it's over", he said
Liar! He couldn't have
I may be pretty worthless,
but you frighten me, Annie
You're lying because your
pride is hurt, you're heartless
No, I'd like to believe
you. I feel sorry for you
Gilbert was too upright
and pure to have done that
My sister is lying
Because you're jealous
Of whom? Of what? Have you
ever looked at yourself?
It was him and me; you didn't count
- He was marrying me
- To darn his socks
I'm warning you for the last time
We were happy like she'll never be
That's why she killed
him, so I'd never be happy
She had lots of men; all I had was him
You never had him! He
never made love to you once!
Remove the accused
With me, a thousand times!
Shut up! You killed him!
I meant to kill myself. Me, not him!
It smells good
The last tin of sauerkraut
- I've no cigarettes
- Look in my bag
You've lashed out a bit;
that's a fancy pistol
A present for myself. My noose
Interesting. You've got
the impulse, all right
But suicide isn't easy; I
know what I'm talking about
You need a method, imagination and talent
- To pull the trigger?
- That's for amateurs
You're clueless; I've rehearsed
every detail of my suicide
Yet you aren't dead
Very nearly
The noose was around my neck;
then I looked in the mirror
You got scared?
On second thoughts. I knew it would be a flop
When the audience arrives, the play is over
Suicide's for oneself, not others
Suicide is always a protest
against someone or something
The pleasure is gone if
you can't see their faces
Yes, it should be done before a witness
I won't be a spectator
I didn't mean you
Come on, let's eat
Suicide is meaningful only
if committed in good health
You warned Gilbert his ex-mistress
was armed and out to kill him?
Yet you didn't know her
Jerome Lamy told me to worn Gilbert
Jerome Lamy
But he only repeated a
remark by Michel Delaunay
Michel Delaunay, too
We must clarify the question
Was there premeditation?
You knew her criminal intention?
Certainly not. I knew she'd
bought a gun to kill herself
Yet you, her friend, leave her with the gun
We used to talk about suicide
For four years I had a noose;
Dominique liked the idea
Murder didn't cross your mind?
Didn't Delaunay tell you?
Not exactly; he was just
talking to some friends
He said Dominique was armed
and would do something foolish
I thought she'd use it on herself;
that's what I told Martineau
Adding that Gilbert should be
wary; but you expected suicide
I don't like this suicide stuff
You never know what will
happen when a girl totes a gun
You're cheerful
Has she still a grudge?
She can't be very happy
that I'm marrying her sister
You'd better be careful.
Don't go out, we'll eat here
Eat what?
I'll buy something
It's going to rain
- Where do I buy wine?
- Ask the concierge
Not expecting me?
How long are you going on with this?
Make up your mind
All right, just walk out
of here without any fuss
I've endured enough tantrums. It's all over
Over and done with
Don't worry. I won't bother you again.
I've suffered enough, I'm exhausted
I'll leave you in peace for ever
All your suicide talk doesn't fool me
How could I have thought you so wonderful?
What a creep
What a thing to die for
In the six months we lived
together, you cheated all the time
One day we both said: Enough.
Now you decide I'm your hero
And you want to kill yourself over me
You must be kidding
I can't help it if I love you
You're just trying to ruin my life again
But I say you're getting out, fast!
I'll throw you out
Go to the devil! Get out!
You're crazy. You're sick
I won't bother you again
There you go again. You're mad!
I've had enough
I never want to see you again
You make me sick!
die if you like, but make a good job of it
The wounds are numbered as I
examined them, not as inflicted
The first was fatal and hit the thorax...
...puncturing the right lung,
causing severe haemorrhage
Continue, doctor
I was saying that the
bullet struck the thorax...
...puncturing the right lung
It went in here and I found it there
The second was also fatal...
- There were six altogether
- You'll lose the initiative
...hairline at a slight angle...
...entering the right temple,
lodging in the base of the skull...
...damaging some brain tissue
My client admits she fired the bullets
This is the post mortem report
But we agree there were
six bullets, three fatal
The veracity of human feelings is
more important than technical detail
Guerin's trying it on
Prosecution?
The accused has never
denied causing the wounds
She denies intent to kill Tellier
You don't insist on the report
Do you wish to continue?
As you please
We thank you
Despite our respect for the
Prosecution, we beg to differ
The accused should clarify...
...certain points
She admits she fired
Beyond discussion, eh?
She has no recollection of the scene
Out of mind, conveniently
out of sight, is that it?
Might the accused come
down before the jury...
...to mime the event, so we may
see if details, trajectories...
...correspond with "veracity"?
Bring the accused
This is hardly compatible with
the dignity of these proceedings
I am responsible for decorum here
This reconstruction...
...is simply to help the
jury to arrive at the truth
She claims she intended to kill
herself in front of Gilbert...
...but lost her head
Let us verify that
You were more resolute at the time
How did you hold the gun?
To kill yourself?
Like this first
And Gilbert got the bullet
She doesn't really understand
Let's begin at the beginning
Was Gilbert far from you?
Facing you?
I don't remember
Through the temple, doctor?
She must have shot from above
Gilbert was collapsing?
Then it wasn't the first shot
The only one fired horizontally,
when he was still standing...
...is this one
She doesn't remember;
she fired in sudden anger
The facts are there and
prove you have lied twice
You never mentioned suicide,
he would have disarmed you
There was no discussion,
you faced him threateningly
He said horrible things
You fired, rapidly and fanatically
On his knees he begs you. You shoot again
You fire four more shots
No?
Those four shots you were
prevented from describing...
Their angle indicates
that the victim had fallen
Doctor, we thank you
I defy anyone to claim
there was time for reflection
A hysterical woman empties the
magazine. What more do you expect?
That she be honest and stop
this nonsense about suicide
But she was found at death's door
Just in time, as usual
You knew Martineau would
return: there was no great risk
I just rushed into the bathroom
The man you adore might still
be alive, yet you leave him
To kill myself
Self again
The gun was empty
Clever of you not to save a bullet
She didn't count the shots
You didn't jump out of the
window; gas was less dangerous
You knew you'd be saved
I wanted to die!
He's got her
Three or four failed suicides;
you seemed better at murder
You have no heart; one must be
capable of love to judge love
How dare you joke of suicide?
You depict her as a Circe
Can she help her looks?
Men pursued her like game;
Gilbert did, especially
Did she encourage him?
For three weeks he harasses her
Nothing stops him, not even her affairs
He wants her, he takes her...
...still warm from another's
embrace you call that love?
For seven months, all he
offered her was his bed
And that only for fleeting
moments, not to upset his routine
But he did propose marriage
He risked nothing, they were too poor then
He forgot marriage when
his situation improved
In fact, they broke up. Why?
Malicious gossip, a
misunderstanding left to fester
As Gilbert's prospects improved,
Dominique became expendable
You call that love
This isn't the moment for your plea
Is there a right moment for justice?
For months she goes hungry,
begging, even prostituting herself
Did he reach out a helping hand?
No, and you call that love?
One night she comes to beg forgiveness
He allows her to hope, so
as to take advantage of her
He sends her packing
She returns, saying she means to kill herself
He dares her to do it
I cannot believe in this love
But Gilbert did love me, you
just don't want to admit it!
That's the only truth
I was stupid and I did
wrong. but he did love me
Now I don't care what happens
Do what you like; I'm afraid of nothing
You sit there...
...dressed up, ridiculous!
You want to judge, but you've never loved!
You hate me, because you are all dead!
This is intolerable
So is your treatment of this poor creature
I protest!
Your cruelty disgraces our profession
It is seven-thirty. The court
is adjourned until one tomorrow
Guerin really went for you;
you didn't deserve that...
...but why were you so harsh on the girl?
Because I represent the
victim's mother; I speak for her
If it were your son who
was shot, you'd understand
Last night Dominique
Marceau tried to kill herself
She is unable to appear I
shall read out her letter
Your Honour, I must write in the dark
If I turn on the light, I might be seen
You may not read this...
... but I realize it's hopeless,
I've always been in the wrong
Everyone else is right: my
sister, my mother, my teachers...
... and you, too
Please forgive me
Gilbert's mother above
all. I loved only Gilbert
I shall never love anyone again
An easy promise, since I'm going to die
I swear it's true, I meant
to die after killing him
I failed because I'm so clumsy
But this time I won't fail
And if Gilbert can still
see me, he'll forgive me
He loved me, but we didn't
love each other at the same time
That's why he's dead
and I'm going to join him
I've tried to explain...
I have just been advised...
...that Dominique Marceau is dead
This trial is terminated
I'm glad I'm not in his shoes
We will be next week: the Moreau case
Rotten luck
An occupational hazard
