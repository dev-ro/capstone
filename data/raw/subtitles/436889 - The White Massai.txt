People say massai give up only
when there's nothing left.
I couldn't imagine that I will get
myself into situation like this.
Massai live neither in future nor in past.
They live here and now.
For too long I didn't understand that way of life.
For too long.
THE WHITE MASSAI
It happened in Kenya after two weeks of vacation.
This was our last day there.
I wanted to spend even more time there.
Stefan decided that we should finally go to Mumbassa.
We were together for over two years.
And I was confident in our relationship.
Are you ready Carola?
Carola, this is massai!
- What?
- The massai.
Carola?
This land left ineffaceable impression upon me.
The peace, colors, sounds, people.
I wanted to be there.
A little strange, I must say.
We're almost there.
Stefan, I'm afraid of this place.
Today is our last day here.
Yeah, okay.
You wait here.
You wait for me.
Please, one minute, yes?
It'll take a minute, I'll be back.
What?
He said we should wait here.
- Move, this is a set-up!
- Wait!
Jumbo, any problems?
We are a little lost.
Maybe do you know the way to the ferries?
- Ferry?
- Yes.
Come, come.
Take my shot.
- Is it okay?
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Every person has special memories in their life.
I couldn't think of anything special in mine.
Hey! Damn!
What now?
I don't even know.
Come! Come!
Come with us!
- Wanna come with them?
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.
- No.
Come on.
Thank you.
Good bye.
You wanna...
Wanna come with us for a drink?
Okay.
What's the occasion?
One drink, we'll have fun.
Jumbo, excuse me.
Can you make a photo please?
Smile please.
Thank you.
Stop. Residents only.
They are my guests.
I'm sorry, residents only.
It's okay, it's okay.
- Where do you go?
- Bush.
Wait!
Let's go with them.
Thank you.
Stefan.
- Tonight is the last night.
- I know.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
I wanna go.
Hello. Three cokes please.
You dance?
Don't you want?
Come drink with us.
We're sitting over there.
I don't want to drink.
What happened?
Let me go!
It's Christmass.
Christmass is the celebration of love!
Stefan.
Stop this right now!
I'm sorry I have to go now.
Thank you.
- Good bye, Lemalian.
- Good bye, Carola.
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.
Thank you very much.
- Would you like to seat together?
- Yes.
Thank you, madam.
Thank you.
I'm not coming.
What?
I'm not coming.
Carola, please.
Stefan. I'm not coming.
You have maggots in your head.
It's not maggots.
What then?
- You start getting on my nerves.
- I haven't even started yet.
This is not working anymore.
Thank you sir.
Eventually I saw my man getting on the flight.
I was waiting.
Suddenly I felt growing detachment from him.
I must do it.
I must do it whatever it takes.
- Hello.
- Hello, Carola.
- Where's...
- Lemalian?
- Yeah.
- Home.
Home? Where's home?
Barseloi, Samburu.
How do I get to Barseloi?
Take a bus to Neirobi.
In Neirobi you ask for a bus to Maralai.
To Malarai.
And in Maralai?
In Malarai you ask for Elisabeth.
Elisabeth.
Excuse me, where do I buy a ticket to Maralai?
Ticket to Maralai?
- Ticket to what?
- Maralai.
Ah, Maralai.
Hello. To Maralai ticket?
- When does it leave?
- After one hour.
Bus went for 13 hours.
I was taking a trip to Maralai.
There's not much to see for tourists there.
But I liked it.
I felt peaceful in this bus.
Are you okay?
Very bad.
- Are you a doctor?
- No.
- Where are you going?
- Maralai.
- What for? Business?
- No.
- A man.
- Samburu?
Do you know this man?
- This man?
- Yeah.
No, I don't know this man.
Elisabeth? Muzungu?
Yes, I know Elisabeth Muzungu.
I'll be your guide.
If you want to swim,
I'll show you the best swim.
I'll show you the best coffee shop...
Elisabeth!
Pay them, not too much.
Thank you.
- So where you're from?
- Switzerland.
I guess you need a shower.
And if you didn't find me?
- I didn't think about it.
- You should.
So you want to see a man.
Coffee?
You think I must have gone crazy.
- What is his name?
- Lemalian.
A Samburu warrior from Barseloi.
So what?
You are married to a Kenyan.
This is a town.
Barseloi is not.
There's only shadows and dust.
There's no shower, no drinking water.
One day they live in a place,
the next day this place is ruined.
It's hard to live there.
Unusual for you, that's for sure.
So do you know this man?
I mean... what do you expect?
I better come to Barseloi.
I don't understand you.
Somebody must make it clear for you.
What women want is not so important.
Not for a warrior.
This is Carola from Switzerland.
She'd like to stay with us.
Is that okay?
This is Moses, my man.
- Would you like something to eat?
- Yeah.
- Where's that opener?
- It's in the shelf.
A warrior cannot eat with women.
A warrior cannot eat what woman cooked.
A warrior cannot allow a woman
to touch another warrior,
you can touch only him.
Touch goes a long way here.
I know.
I want to go with my friends.
I want to go with my friends.
Moses was one of the most handsome
men in Maralai. And he knew it.
Moses is a very proud man.
Don't think about everything,
you go direct to your aim.
And you?
I have a house and my garden.
For a white woman, there's not much to do here.
Lemalian is the first man I went for.
I don't think about the life here.
I don't think about myself.
Are you sure that he's the one?
I hope so. I don't know.
Besides Lemalian was the first man I went looking for.
I will find him.
Maybe he will find me.
In any case I try.
You are here for ten days now...
Bad figures.
Will you come back?
Everything okay?
Everything is okay.
Everything is in order.
In order?
You stay with me.
You stay with me.
In Samburu you don't look back when you're leaving.
They think it's bad luck.
I don't want to look back.
Not any more.
Carola.
Listen.
Wait.
This is my mother.
Switzerland.
Everything super.
My name is Carola.
I'm looking for Lemalian.
Just straight that way.
Thanks.
Good night, Carola.
Thanks.
No, no, no, come.
Women don't undress.
You don't undress here. Come.
Will you help me?
No. No.
Slowly.
Eyes.
Nose.
Mouth.
Sorry?
I just want to say hello.
You're standing on my onions.
Are you from Germany?
From Switzerland.
Carola Leiman.
Father Bernardo.
I have literally found one woman in Maralai.
How did you get here?
On foot. From Maralei.
I need to repair my car.
If you will be so kind as to excuse me,
I have work to do.
Is not allowed for white people to leaving area.
Why not? I'm not doing anything wrong.
It's not allowed.
Why not? I'm a tourist.
No way to leaving Barseloi.
You're not a tourist.
You're not a resident.
You're not even married.
Money. You want money.
You have to register.
You get the pass in Neirobi.
You register or you go.
Lemalian?
Where were you?
Why do you cry?
I'm so happy that you're back.
But you're not allowed to eat with women.
White woman is different.
And Neirobi is far from home.
- What is that?
- Take it. It's mira.
Very spicy.
It's very good.
Migration Department. This is it.
Wait, wait.
You can't go in looking like this.
What's wrong?
Get him pants.
Get him a shirt.
And first of all, no weapons.
Maybe you stay here and I go in alone.
What? Look, I'm not a dog, okay?
- I'm a warrior.
- Yeah, you're right.
We come back later.
We come back later.
- Did I hurt you?
- No.
I'm very tired.
Everything okay.
Now you get the baby.
Carola, Carola!
You're okay?
You're okay Carola?
I'm so cold.
- You're okay now?
- No. It's cold.
I'm not sick.
Not sick.
It's okay.
Take it. It's good for you.
- No.
- Please.
It's malaria. Just malaria.
What's the matter?
Of course I'll come home, just not now.
Yes. No, for now I'll be living here.
Yes, in the village.
Mama, I need my money,
you must send them here.
- Do you know this man?
- No, why would I know him?
Then why are you laughing with him?
I'm happy.
Eighteen thousand five hundred.
This is a registration book.
And the keys for a truck.
Enjoy your car now.
Come in.
I hope you haven't overpaid for your truck.
- It's a ratteltrap.
- No it's not.
It's a nice car.
You don't look so good.
What's your problem Father Bernardo?
You should not drive throughout Bush.
Take a shorter road to Barseloi.
- It will last two hours shorter.
- Thank you, is that all?
Carola, I drive now.
Let me drive, it's okay I can do it.
It's not so easy, Lemalian.
It's okay, I wanna drive. I can drive.
It's easy. Let me drive, Carola.
And then the gear.
Don't go too fast.
Please! Don't go too fast!
Brake!
You could have killed us!
God! Damn!
Lemalian.
Are you okay?
What happened?
Please. Please come in.
I'm sorry.
Please come in.
Please.
I'm beginning to not look well.
I must go to Switzerland.
But your home is now here. In Barseloi.
You go back to Stefan?
No, I have to say good-bye to my family.
And my shop, I have to sell my shop.
You come back for sure?
Of course I come back.
And then you marry me.
Marry? Aren't you allowed to do this?
You're a warrior.
There will be a big ceremony soon.
And then I'll be allowed to marry you.
So promise me, will you come back?
I promise.
Is that tasty or not?
It's very luscious, very good.
It was better the last time.
You made it one hundred percent chocolate rich.
Too much cacao makes it too sugary.
But that was very sweet.
Do you like it sweet, Carola?
I'm getting married.
- At least not in Bush.
- In Bush, mama.
I will marry Lemalian in Bush.
Don't forget to take her there tomorrow.
We can sell it for 16 thousand.
This is a good price.
His name is Lemalian?
I still cannot believe you're selling your shop.
Carola.
Yes. Of course.
Let's do it.
And again I'm here with these people.
I hear different languages.
And can't understand a word.
I was returning home.
I knew always.
You should love me,
you come back to my home.
For the cows.
Baby?
I see you have a big day today.
I'm getting married today, didn't I tell you?
In Samburu white color has two meanings.
These are cleanliness and unpleasantness.
What is it in your opinion?
This means from now on
your life won't be simple here.
I think everything will be fine.
Actually, I'm happy.
I must prepare for mass.
Super.
You wear veil.
Yes.
Everything okay?
Girls are so young.
Yes, yes, they are young.
Please, come.
Why do they do this?
- She has to be cut before marriage.
- But she's a child.
Not any more.
Now she's a woman.
- But we have to help her, please.
- No Carola, this is our tradition.
You can't help her.
I'll tell Father.
You must come with me.
What's the rush?
- You seem...
- A girl is bleeding there.
She's being cut!
No one is dying there, these people know what they're doing.
That's all?
You'll just sit here?
She is only 15.
Here that's the age to get married.
You see, I try to help people here.
I can only try, not give orders.
I have to respect their customs.
I've been here for 20 years.
These customs have been here for hundreds of years!
If you do nothing, you must hate these people!
What do you think I can do?
I will not persuade you.
But you must know what you want.
Here you live with these customs or you don't.
- Do you?
- I'm a priest.
I don't want to marry anyone here.
Rule number one, here you must do what they do.
If you will not understand that,
you're not gonna be here anymore.
This is a very good advice.
Nice. You drink too much.
You drink all the time,
we're having a party.
Thank you.
How are you Carola?
You're having fun?
You are so...
You're so strong and independent...
So much strength.
You're so much stronger than me.
Do you want an elephant?
No, really!
I'm gonna open the shop in Barseloi.
A shop? What for?
So everybody could buy food.
I had a shop once...
But this is not Switzerland.
A shop is a shop.
I think people will like it.
I think it's the burden only you can handle.
Cheers for the strong woman!
Cheers for the elephants.
A shovel.
I can do that.
We don't need a shovel.
We have our good.
You don't understand.
We don't need that shovel.
Yes we need, I need the shovel.
I need something to eat, don't you understand?
We can eat then.
Where's Father Bernardo?
God!
I can't help her.
I'm no doctor!
Help me. Please.
Come on, we have to bring her to Maralai!
Please, help me. Come.
Don't touch her.
- Don't touch her.
- Please help me.
- Carola, no.
- Please.
No. Don't touch her.
Don't touch her.
Help me, come on please!
Help me.
I need help, help me please!
Help me!
God, help me please.
Please!
Please help me.
Damn!
Just go!
- Please just go!
- I'll help you!
Go!
Okay, go.
Go!
Where's Moses?
On the coast.
We're leaving this place by next week.
Moses have found a good job in Malendi.
This is all for the best, we will have more money.
Though I'm gonna miss you.
You're having fights with Lemalian?
Sometimes I think I don't know him.
It happens.
This is life. Nothing to be afraid of.
I won't.
Life here is very simlple,
but other times very complicated.
Still it is our life.
You must get on with it.
Yes.
Rice.
- And the cups?
- Yeah, cups please.
- Soap is there.
- Yeah, soap is there.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- This is for you.
- Thank you.
- And then till next time.
- See you.
Carola.
This is Mike.
He is my nephew.
He helps, you pay.
- Your nephew.
- Yeah.
- I don't need him.
- You need him.
Don't think you can open the shop.
You're not having license.
Okay then.
Carola, many people, too many people.
Ready?
Mike. Mike?
I need more sugar.
Mike!
I was saving this bottle
for a special occasion.
Which it is today?
I was getting used to it.
White people, only tourists come here.
Live here for some time.
And then they're gone without leaving a trace.
It seems to me that you are different.
Respect.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Okay then.
You should not behave yourself this easy.
People.
Men, I mean.
Sorry?
People don't behave this way here.
It could be understood wrong.
I think you've waited for a long time to tell me that.
Yes, maybe.
Don't underestimate the misery.
- I do not.
- Then you make me no trouble.
What are you doing here?
Akuna matata.
Why is that door open?
What?
Who was here right now?
No one, why?
It was your lover.
You have a boyfriend, I know Carola.
No!
You're lying to me.
You are lying to your man?
You have a boyfriend and he was right here.
I had to open it, there's so much dust in here.
- Please, Lemalian.
- You shut up!
Please, stop it, please.
Please stop!
You shame me.
You shame my people.
Now I know, the baby is not my baby.
This is somebody else's baby.
Please Lemalian, stop it.
Stop it.
Calm down.
Please calm down.
You haven't a boyfriend.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Don't do this anymore.
It's all right.
Where's Lemalian?
He's in the Bush.
I want to talk to Lemalian.
He is in the Bush.
Listen, it's all right.
720 shilling please.
Note it down.
Note it down.
Write down?
You want credit?
- I always get credit.
- No credit.
Everybody have to pay.
I always get credit.
Who?
Famadi, only Famadi.
And neighbours.
Everybody are our neighbours.
And Mini-Chief also?
Mini-Chief always gets credit.
Please no credit anymore.
- No more credit please.
- Why? They are our friends.
I know it.
Everyone is our friend here.
But we need the money, do you understand?
We can take more money from the bank.
From Switzerland.
Lemalian, do you understand what it's about?
This is a shop, it's business!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, it's okay.
It's in here anyway.
But please no more credit.
Okay. No more credit.
Lemalian.
Carola.
No. No.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, I'm doctor Banderas.
Obviously she's conscious.
She's got yellow eyes.
Slowly.
Okay, one, two, three, up.
Okay, I understand!
Thanks, over and out.
She's okay now.
No danger anymore.
- And the baby?
- They don't know.
Sarai.
Sarai.
What are the money for?
This is for protection.
Money for protection?
Give the money back.
Give me the money!
This is very bad.
We get no protection anymore.
Is this everything we have?
No credit.
No, I give no credit.
Sorry, no credit.
It's different now, it's 350 shilling.
And no more credit.
- Go.
- I'll tell my uncle.
Go. Come on.
Keep away and never come back.
- No good.
- It's very good.
No good.
I can't. Not now.
It's too early, we have to wait a little.
Lemalian.
Saguna?
Saguna?
Mike.
- I'll kill you, bloody muzungu!
- What?
Calm down.
I'll kill you bloody muzungu! I'll kill you!
- Lemalian!
- I'll kill you!
- Stop it please!
- Be quiet!
So, Mini-Chief should pay a price.
He is responsible for his nephew's actions.
Okay.
Mini-Chief will give you five goats
because his nephew offended you.
Lemalian, take them.
Everything okay?
The shop is your business.
And now the goats are your business too.
- Hello sweety.
- Hello, mama.
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Fine, that's all?
- How's your wife?
- Oh, good.
Say hello to her please.
If I need more beers, I think I'll be coming.
Yeah, of course, I'm always there.
- Is this man your boyfriend?
- No. Of course not.
- This is a client, you know that.
- No, Carola, this man is your boyfriend.
- What's wrong?
- Lemalian.
You are my husband, I love you.
Lemalian. Listen to me.
Just listen to me.
Lemalian, please let...
You have a boyfriend.
You are a whore.
Go straight to house. Quick.
What is that? What is that?
God!
- You lost that.
- What?
You lost that, it came out of you.
Where's your boyfriend?
Where's your boyfriend?
I know you sleep with Kreinz!
You lost that!
You are crazy!
You are completely crazy!
I'll kill your boyfriend!
- I'll kill him right now!
- You stop it!
Stop it!
Don't touch me!
- Please!
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
- Stop it!
- Don't touch me!
I can't...
Do you respect me now?
You sleep with my woman!
You sleep with my woman!
- I know nothing!
- You sleep with her!
I will help you.
There's nothing to help here.
Apparently it is.
- You're leaving.
- Yes.
Just for two weeks or so.
To Switzerland.
- And Sarai?
- I take her with me.
Why?
Because my mother wants to see her.
Now I need the signature of the father here.
Lemalian.
The signature of the father is required here.
What does this mean?
Name of child Sarai Leiman.
No. Her name is Mamutegi.
She's my daughter.
Of course she's your daughter.
Look, there are people waiting in the line.
Will you just sign it?
Next.
Please just sign it.
Please.
The bus is leaving soon. Please.
We only have 15 minutes, please.
- Will you come back?
- Of course I'll come back.
Please, excuse me.
Can you read this again?
Name of father Lemalian Mamutegi.
Name of mother Carola Leiman.
Name of child Sarai Leiman.
It's Mamutegi.
Will you come back?
Please, can you read this?
- You have a pen?
- Yeah.
I know you'll never come back.
