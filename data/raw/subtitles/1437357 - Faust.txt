Based on the tragedy by
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
You've told us so much about
the composition of the human body...
...but not a word about the soul.
I haven't found it.
Where does one look for the soul?
The skin is thin, perforated...
Large and long...
The soul. And life...
Where are they hidden, then?
In the head?
There's only rubbish in there!
Or in the heart?
Sometimes I have the feeling that...
...both reside in the feet.
- How do you mean?
- If one is startled...
Up, up, up, up!
...then one suddenly feels...
...so much life in the startled feet.
Nonsense!
You clean up here!
The rag is dirty. Look!
- That rag is clean.
Smell for yourself!
I made a mistake.
It's the formalin!
Do you think that
I'm already dead?
- That was an accident.
- Like the berries with carbolic acid...
...you served me last night?
Carbolic acid dulls the pain.
The pain of the world.
And the pain of the soul.
What the soul is and
where it resides...
...only God knows.
And the Foe of all mankind.
Quit babbling.
Carbolic acid, carbolic acid...
And one of them has finally flown!
So, where will I find...
...these two gentlemen?
- God is everywhere.
- Thus He is nowhere.
- And the Devils they say...
...where there is money,
there you find the Devil.
- I have no money.
- Then you're not the Devil.
Thank you. That's very reassuring.
- Who is he then?
No one knows for sure.
Word has it, the fat guy in the square
might be something of the sort.
Really?
- What would you wish for?
- From the Devil?
Two things. Firstly, I'd wish
to rid myself of the entire world.
Secondly, I'd wish to see you
more often.
How could you see me more often...
...if the world were gone?
Simple.
The world goes away,
except for you and me.
Try someone else.
I'll stick with humanity.
For the common good.
The corpse can go. Be quick...
...it is starting to stink.
- How shall I pay...
...the gravediggers?
They must wait until tomorrow
Then I will pay them.
- Come in. Von can take him.
- What about our money?
- Tomorrow.
- Always the same.
So cold. That's that.
Excuse me.
Everything comes and goes
according to law...
...only man's life is overcast
by faltering fortune.
The God who dwells within
my breast...
...who can shake my soul
in its depths...
...who sits enthroned over
all my powers...
...outside me He is powerless.
Professor, when shall the two
of them come by tomorrow?
I don't want to hear about it.
I am starving.
- I'm off!
Where to?
Where, where? There!
Hold him tight.
Why are you standing there stock still?
- But he is kicking!
Old fool! Why are you kicking?!
Nothing has changed.
Your son, Doctor.
I see. I'll he done shortly.
Why does this place always stink
so terribly?
My father. An honorable man,
lost in the dark.
What use is all this to him?
What are you up to?! Get out!
Thief!
Go and see what the Professor
is doing over there!
Tell him people are trying
to work over here!
You're wanted.
You are breaking his spine!
What do you want?
Nothing. To see you.
To see what? I'm not a painting.
It's too tight.
And you're charging money for this?
And whom exactly would I be charging?
Those people over there.
My patients don't have anything.
Untie him, please.
Good method.
Tested on many a patient.
- And haw many have survived?
- I've never counted.
As usual.
- Can you walk?
- I don't know.
- Steady on your legs?
- Yes.
- Then get out of here!
- What the heck?
Tomorrow you will be hopping around
like a rabbit.
Are you sleeping poorly?
I don't sleep at all.
Someone has survived the rack.
- At last!
You love your rack.
One can't work on
an empty stomach.
True.
These are Gad's gifts.
Come, brothers. The flesh is calling.
Nothing has been cleaned!
I always have to do everything myself!
That George!
- Smells nice! What is it?
- Here I am!
Out!
Mine!
It is my due!
Who is the meat from?
From Frau Weber,
whose appendix you snipped.
- Didn't earn much.
- I don't have such huge needs...
...as our dear professor.
- Needs...
...I don't even have enough money
for ink.
I'm willing to forsake
everything... the house...
- Sit down.
...food. Anything.
- To do without is good for one.
- If only I were certain...
- Of what?
- That what I'm doing has meaning.
No. I'm not giving you any.
No!
What? What do you mean?
Surely you want money?
He who limits himself...
...creates his own small fortune.
His own small fortune.
Heard that a thousand times.
One must work and never beg.
- You again!
- I've been waiting for two hours.
I'm sick.
What is it now? Let's have a look.
You are like an onion!
There is no getting close to you!
Lie down!
Help me.
I don't understand... what is this?
Pass me the vaginal speculum.
Hold her legs down.
I work day and night.
I love no one, I have no family...
...I never sleep.
I find your reproaches unjust.
I'm doing my best.
What good is it to me if my soul
is empty? I feel no happiness...
...no anger, no compassion.
- The soul...
...one can do without It.
Why complicate things?
Matter. Black.
Hollow.
My hammer strikes the knee and
the leg twitches.
That's it.
- That is not enough for me.
- Then leave.
I have no money for you.
Nor the meaning of life.
Let's look at what we have here.
That's a pity.
Venus. Venus.
What are you doing?!
He is a good man, your father.
A good man.
A good man, in his darkest yearning...
...still knows the one...
...true way.
Must do without.
You must do without.
That's the eternal song.
The eternal song.
The eternal song.
The eternal song.
- Let me through!
Don't be so greedy!
- No! This has been ordered!
- Enough!
Shut up!
Would the gentleman have
a few pennies to spare?
- No. I'm sorry.
- Just a few coins.
- We are starving!
- So am I.
Such a line gentleman and no money.
Nothing in the pockets?
Noblemen are so forgetful,
aren't they?
- Snotty brat!
Me? A brat? I'll smash your face in!
Watch your jewels!
- I'll knock the stuffing out of you!
- Swine!
- Bastards!
- Dirt bag!
- Cunny!
Bonehead!
- Get lost!
Let me. I'll show him!
I'll let you fly.
Who is this?
Good day, dear sir.
Who is this?
Black. Like Death himself.
Good day, sir.
Or is Death grey?
Father Philipp. You're here already.
I thought I'd be late.
Debt after debt I have amended!
Yes, the affair is settled
as far as you're concerned.
- There is my coach.
- A remarkable pair.
Death and a priest.
And I. A starving man.
You're hungry, too?
Everybody is starving...
Who is this from?
From Lent, the poet.
A strangely unhappy man...
No need lo return it.
The unhappy are dangerous!
Good day, sir.
My name is Faust, Doctor Faust.
I salute the learned gentleman!
I'm the owner of this firm.
My name is Muller, Mauritius.
I am Mauricius Muller...
Who are you, please?
A part of the power...
...that always does what's good.
Where does the second voice
come from? Does he have two tongues?
Do come in! I'm all ears.
Please be careful.
This is all pawned property?
A pledge of security,
as the law calls it.
- This is my midwifeâ€™s.
- Really?
- I know her. Frau Menzel.
- It's a small world.
And with these,
you weigh money?
No, souls.
- Are they heavy!
- No heavier than a coin.
- I thought so.
- Most of them...
...but not yours.
The man has no sense of humour.
Take a seal.
Thank you.
A starving man never
has a sense of humour.
- This here.
- If I may.
I'd like to pawn this.
This is no ordinary ring!
The philosopher's stone!
It explains the nature of things.
- Then it must be worth something.
- On the contrary.
It's worth nothing.
Life has declined in value...
...not to mention death
I don't understand.
What's worth anything then?
Time... Art...
Who is rustling there?
Who is creeping around?
I need money.
- Anything else you desire?
- I am still ton young...
...to be without desire.
- I have a desire, ton.
I collect autographs.
"The Foundations of Human Physiology."
- Did you write this?
- Even if I did...
...I couldn't sign it for you.
I have no money for ink.
Soon I'll have to write in blond.
No need. I have ink.
Your knowledge is impressive.
Here you are.
This work will outlive you.
The word dies...
...before it leaves the pen.
- Over here, yes...
...but there is also the world beyond.
I'm so tired. Man's wretched ways
exhaust me.
And my heart aches.
- Now, give me the money!
- No.
- What would you accept in pawn?
- Anything.
- Even rubbish?
- It depends.
An old tract
about the meaning of life?
- No, no.
- A perpetuum mobile?
Spare me!
The relics of Saint Sebastian?
The relics? That's a good one.
- Where would you find those?
- Seek and you shall find.
Did this Sebastian ever exist?
Maybe.
- Maybe not.
- What are you saying?
I'm saying,
there won't be any money.
- Do you see this hole?
- Nu.
I wanted to pluck a rose blossom...
...for a maiden.
- You should mend it.
Mend It! Where does one
find the right cloth?
And time? And money?
No money! No time!
Spent it all!
That's how it is then.
He shall eat dust,
and eat eagerly.
I will see what I can do
for you. Doctor.
Never mind.
Ferdinand! My registry!
Ferdinando!
It's not under my pillow!
I have hidden it somewhere else.
I'm thirsty! Pour me some wine!
Certainly, madam.
Law, medicine, philosophy...
...and sadly even theology...
.I've studied with passionate
resolution.
And stand here now...
...a fool for sure,
no wiser than I was before.
Excuse me.
[Everything fleeting
is only a stench]
- Calm down!
We can't get through with the coffin!
Everyone over here!
I'm here! I'm with you!
Patience, patience! Don't move!
Let the pigs through!
There we go. Come on.
Ida. I need hot water.
What's this I need?!
I have to cook now.
In the beginning was the Word...
...the Word...
in the beginning was the Word...
...the Word...
You again! Come in!
In the beginning was the Word...
And the Word was with God.
Do you understand how this is meant?
- No.
- Neither do I.
"in the beginning was the Word..."
Already I'm stuck.
Impossible for me to rate the word...
...so highly.
- You must translate it some other way.
Maybe "the thought"?
In the beginning was...
in the beginning
was the thought that acts...
...and creates everything.
- In the beginning was the I.
- Whose "I"?
- Mine.
- Von were in the beginning?
- Why not?
- Then we're all doomed.
- I don't believe so.
- Ida!
That was on purpose!
There you have your water!
Furniture wrecker!
Little termite!
- in the beginning was the Word.
- Such manners! In our home!
- No, you're mistaken.
In the beginning was the thought...
...that acts and creates everything
in the beginning was an I.
Listen lo...
...wise little Wagner...
...who nearly bursts
with love for his master.
In the beginning was the thought...
...wise little Wagner...
Yes, wise little Wagner.
Or the great...
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Slop it.
But It's the latest fashion
in France!
I look like a corpse in this colour.
Did you bring what I asked for?
Yes.
Give it to me! There it is.
Thank you.
I hope your brawn liquid is good.
- it all depends on the dose.
- As long as it works.
Will you miss me?
Begin the procedure.
Wagner! Will you miss me?
Miss you?
I can't say whether I'll miss you.
Yes or no?
Or would you join me in death?
- What's that! Stinging nettle?
- It stimulates the vital organs.
- And spells the appetite.
- Nu. I won't miss you.
- Why not!
I can tell you...
...why I won't miss you.
- Alright.
What are the gentlemen doing?!
An abominable stench throughout
the house!
Like a witches kitchen!
As a consolation I'll drink it, too!
No, you won't.
I'll drink it all myself.
- Where is my towel?
Don't walk barefoot!
What are you doing here? I'm
not receiving today. I have to go.
A decent gentleman!
Extremely decent!
You forgo! Your ring.
As an honest man...
...I felt obliged to return it.
How did you get in here?
Who let you in?
Iduberga! Did you let him in?
- Are you running an open house?
- Thank you, Iduberga.
Decent people must keep...
...each others company,
and not mingle with riffraff.
- Thanks, Iduberga.
- Wagner. Why are you shivering?
Get out!
Why not money instead?
- I'd prefer money.
- The Gospel according to John.
- Do you know Greek?
- Nu.
But I'd always recognise
the Holy Scripture.
How so?
My faith helps.
You hope to find
what you're lacking in this hunk?
- What am I lacking!
- I know. A healthy diet.
- For you.
- That won't be necessary.
- Trying.
- If you say so.
I baked it myself.
What is that smell?
- Such a sweet smell!
- Where are you going?
Eat! You'll need it.
How do you know what I'll need?
Eat, eat.
Hemlock!
- From the apothecary next door?
- None of your business.
That was mine!
This is impossible.
You cannot die here!
What is more, I wanted to go.
You are alive? Interesting...
But the poison... How the devil?!
The devil?
Stupid wenches call me that...
...but it's not who I am.
- Who are you then?
If I knew...
What use would it be to you?
I have a certain interest.
In what?
The eternal dilemma.
Oh, no, no!
Out of the question...
...the waiting list is too long.
Too many interested parties...
Who else is on the list?
Tell me. It'll remain between us.
Or are you deceiving me again?
I speak only the naked truth
Our theatre director...
I thought so.
- Your rector.
An idiot! Who else?
The local coffin maker.
Don't touch!
A monkey!
A monkey!
You're lying!
A monkey on the moon!
Then, the butcher,
the music teacher.
- Pfeiffer?!
Yes, exactly. A freemason.
- That's plenty.
- Exactly.
I told you.
What are you looking for?
You stink like a corpse!
What a stench!
I don't smell anything,
but if you say so.
What shall we do?
Should we air the room?
- But how exactly shall we go about It?
- We'll just walk out.
A stroll with you, Doctor, is an honour
and a reward.
By way of saying thanks
I'd like to show you something.
I know everything you could show me
in this town.
And what we do know
is of no use to us.
Ergos what we don't know
will be of use to us.
Give me that! Now explain...
...how It's possible
after such a lethal dose...
that you should still be alive?
Incredible!
Oh, now it starts! I'm dying!
The spirit of denial will survive
this world.
- This is the way out.
Not an ounce of sympathy...
- What?
...for your companion!
Your hemlock was too strong
for my weak stomach.
Thank you.
Thanks for what?
- When will you be back?
- Le! Me do ill.
- Why must we lock it all the time?
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you, Iduberga.
- Ida!
Turn the key to the right!
- To the left!
- What has got into you?
You seem to cause turmoil.
First Wagner, then Ida.
What is going on?
The gate is broken.
Godforsaken corner!
Someone is always getting stuck!
- Your timber is here.
- Put it there.
- You must pay for It.
- How do we get out?
- Patience! God was also patient.
- Is the world loo cramped for you?
What are you all doing here?
You have no business here!
Where is your compassion?
Everyone must live somehow.
And survive. But I'm no saviour.
What do you know how to do?
- Chatter.
- A good remedy.
Maybe, but remedies
are not my speciality.
But there is one simple remedy.
It helps one to live and to survive.
- That way, damn it!
- No, you have to go that way I.
So you know...
a remedy that needs no gold
no magic.
- What is it?
Work your plot...
- Dig, though...
- Rise early!
- Rise early! Milk the cows...
- Feed the cattle...
Feed yourself on the purest fare...
Muck out the stables.
No fear of dirt, or manure.
My stomach! I have to go to...
So narrow a life would never
suit me.
I can't hold it any longer.
Not here! We're not alone!
I can't hold it any longer.
It's your hemlock's fault. Cover me!
Not next to the church!
True.
Better inside the church.
Wait here. I'll be back shortly.
Excuse me, I'm afraid
I don't know you.
Soon we will let you in on the deal.
He has such a weak stomach.
What are you doing here?
Tell me, then, what is the matter?
I know him. You have made
the right decision.
What do you mean?
Reputable men an reputably...
...contract, signature, as is proper.
Excuse me, can I be of service?
And...
...is he really the...?
- He is.
And how about you?
I'm number 150 on the waiting list.
Good. What number am I?
I could give you mine.
No, thanks.
- Surely you don't believe in God?
- Vanity of vanities, boredom...
...the entire world is a failure.
But why do you believe...
...in Satan?
Where is the logic here?
If good doesn't exist...
...then neither can evil. Right?
No, wrong. Good doesn't exist...
...but evil does!
- He has answered you.
What are you talking about!
Your turn. Professor.
Good does not exist, hut evil does.
- Doctor!
- Do you know what you just said?
I'm here!
You're not alone.
Let us leave this place!
In the beginning was the deed!
Let's go home, Agathe!
In the beginning was the deed?
This woman has been following me
for years.
She claims lo be my wife.
- in the beginning was the deed.
- Yes, the deed!
- The deed!
- An interesting solution...
I assumed it was meaning.
Or power.
No, meaning results
from action...
But... Where are we going?
I just wanted to get rid of that woman.
- What is this here?
- I don't know myself.
Seems like a good spot
for our philosophical discussion.
This rings a bell.
I was here as a child.
This is what I call real human life!
Here I'm a man, here I dare to be a man!
- Looks more like a slave market!
- No.
They're made free by work.
Industrious folk.
All very good, but I want to leave!
You are free. Sweet young blood!
Who wouldn't fall in love
with girls like you?
- Von see these women here?
- Yes.
- Only women. And the two of us.
- They're busy.
Yes, and satisfied and carefree.
- Completely and utterly busy.
- Yes. Perhaps.
- Do you see their fingers?
- No.
They're all...
...crooked like this.
That people everywhere are miserable,
I've read in a thousand books.
You've read it!
But man wants to be happy.
Day and night.
With such crooked fingers you could
never open your vial of poison!
What do you mean by that?
It is you who worries me,
not these women.
Although they have nothing,
just ice cold water and work.
There you are!
Oh. My hail.
Aren't you bored?
Nothing but washing...
- Come over here, Gudrun!
- What am I doing here?
Hands off! It's all mine! Go away!
Work, work.
While you're still young.
Wade right in! Don't be stupid!
Get busy, Doctor!
He is a madman! A freak!
My God!
What is that?
- Don't look!
He has nothing in front!
We must pair him off
with old Martha.
She'll be delighted.
Do you like him?
That's me!
What are you staring at? Shameless...
He has nothing in front.
What a tiny little winkle!
When It's that small it doesn't matter
whether it's in front or in back.
There she is, my sweet! Come...
...we'll go for a swim!
- Help!
I don't know how to swim!
My nightgown is floating there.
Next to Gretchen!
- You must give yourself a proper scrub!
- Margarete! Where is your basket?
It's over there.
And these towels?
- Out of the way!
What is the matter?
- Baboon!
What impudence!
- Doctor! Help me please!
- What are you yelling about?
- Can't you be quiet for five minutes?
- My waistcoat.
- I'm not your servant.
- Yes...
...not yet.
- The waistcoat...
...is too tight for your flabby belly.
What do you have against my body?
You're no Apollo yourself.
As for your body, I have
a few questions...
...but not now.
- We have the time.
- I don't.
Time is on the wane. My hat!
Excellent linen.
- Could you move a bit faster?
- Why?
- I have to find her.
- The two ladies have already left.
- I see that. And I want to find them!
- Not a chance.
But I will find them!
Professor. What's the hurry?
- He's following you.
I like that funny old fart.
- There they are.
- I don't.
A professor, and he still dashes around
like a little boy!
There she is.
I'm an old man and can't run
that fast.
You're free...
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.
May I presume, my lovely lady...
...lo offer you my arm and escort?
I'm neither lovely nor a lady...
...and I can get home by myself.
Margarete! Come on!
We must hurry up.
So impudent!
This is not a rose garden!
- Let's go that way.
Not across the square?...
...it would be much faster.
- Come on.
He's already dead.
What are you waiting for?
We need the room. Take him away!
- is he dead?
- Yes.
- Why was he screaming like that?
- Another one cured to death.
Because the Lord God took His time.
What do we have here? Interesting...
- Where does this wonder come from?
- From Schierke.
Schierke. I'm familiar
with the place. Near Bracken.
That's that. Poor fellow.
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing. Come on.
I already did everything I could!
You were cured.
There is no cure for leprosy,
Father.
Who is this you've dragged
here with you?
- We didn't mean to disturb you.
Who are you running around with?
Does your father mean me?
- Hey, you! You old goat!
- Father, stop it!
Father, father, catch me!
Have you tucked in your tail?
- Stop it!
You old goat!
- Where is your tall?
- Do you know him. Father?
- I know you!
- What has he done to you?
Mauricius! We have to go! Follow me!
- Monkey ass! Son of a bitch!
- Again, again...
Mauricius! Come on!
Get out of here! Stinky old goat!
- Likewise!
- Piss off!
- Riffraff!
You stinky old goat!
Mauricius!
Where is your tail? Stinky old goat...
- What is that?
- My wings.
Why are you whining
like a wet poodle?
This way.
- People, peace has come!
No fighting tonight!
We have won!
Let me show you now a jolly company...
...so that you see how easy life can be.
Why does everyone wish to be young?
No thanks!
Esteemed students!
No more free drinks!
- But the war is over!
- Everyone wants to celebrate!
- These fellows will shatter
my eardrums!
Splendid!
- A nasty song.
Better than your father's shouting.
What a pigsty this Is!
Anna! Clean up!
What's the matter?
- First you send everybody away.
- What you waiting for. Wench?
- All you're concerned with is courting
your trollops!
Such a good and honest woman.
Do you have anything decent on offer?
Or are you serving only
donkey piss today?
We have fine wine from Burgundy.
There are plenty of donkeys
in Burgundy. Loo.
What you call Burgundy is probably
in fact Courland.
- Behave yourself!
- Look...
...over there is the Doctor.
He has lost the meaning of life.
- He needs some wine!
- Yes! Here!
Anna! Two glasses of wine!
Doctor, sorry to bother you.
You're a master of astrology,
aren't you?
You're familiar with the stars?
Everybody's talking about...
- Can we order some more wine?
- Bugger off!
Everybody's talking about the comet...
- But we'd like to order more wine!
- Get lost, student scum!
So, about the comet.
What does it mean?
Nothing.
Nothing?
A ball of gas.
A ball of gas?
The comet?
A fart?!
But... of course... it figures...
...that when the sky farts,
a comet appears.
Thank you, Doctor.
Anna! Where are you, silly cow?
Emmerich! Valentin!
I've written a poem
for your beautiful sister.
Professor You're leaving?
- Let me out.
- And who's paying?
He's paying for me, the man in the hack.
That's what everybody says.
I can bring you the money tomorrow.
- My friend is paying.
- Really?
What the hell!
Such impudence!
What so offends the defender
of the Fatherland?
This swill?
Or my presence here?
He didn't mean to offend you.
Then he must apologise.
Alright, enough!
If he is so tender. Then...
...excuse me.
Although there is no reason
to apologise.
You must admit this is donkey piss.
- Enough!
- Pure donkey piss.
- He is drunk. And a soldier!
- A drunken soldier.
He should apologise properly!
Then he'd better keep silent.
Wine is the blood of the earth.
I'll show him
what this blond looks like.
I'm going to see Margarete.
Let's have one more drink
then we'll go.
Be quiet, friendly element.
How did he do that?
It's all a hoax
all tricks, all lies.
Here is a miracle, so just believe.
That's wine? Holy Mary!
We drink to your sister,
to beautiful Margarete!
Swill!
Someone said something
interesting there.
Donkey piss!
The young man is again offended!
So fussy!
Leave It! The old man is too fat
for your short blade!
Doctor, stand your ground!
Stay close to me!
What are you doing?
He has fallen onto my fork!
How clumsy!
It's time for us to disappear.
But we cannot...
...just disappear!
We must!
- He needs help!
- He's not the first.
It's you who needs help.
It's good bread, fresh baked.
Yes, I see.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm just looking.
Congratulations on your new life!
What have you clone?!
I didn't mean to.
It just happened.
As if the Devil himself
put the fork in my ha rid!
It is a mortal sin!
If you must be careless with your
own soul, then please think of mine.
One doesn't die of such wounds!
So you say, poor boy.
He has likely already died.
While you are so cold blooded.
Enough! Who started
the whole thing? You or me?
You just said it yourself... the Devil.
So the question remains open.
You're a clown!
A clown?! This way I.
Why didn't you take...
...my ring?
- The things you worry about.
- You're laughing?!
- Shall I renounce all laughter...
...for your sake?
Just tell me how I can make this right.
- Can you heal his wound?
- No.
Comfort his kin?
No. How big is the family?
Only two people. His mother and sister.
A miserable clan.
They've pawned everything.
No doubt in your shop.
There is no one up there!
It's draughty here.
His sister!
Margarete! What a flower!
I still can't believe that...
...she will wither with grief...
...without tasting
the pleasures of life.
Oh, what have you done?!
We must help them somehow,
give them money...
But there is no money to be had.
Can't you help?
- What can I...
- Oh, come on!
...give to them? The things I have
do not belong to me.
They could be redeemed
at any moment.
What can be dune?
- Come!
- Where are you taking me?
Camel.
Hang the tablecloth over there.
It'll dry more quickly.
There they are.
There she is! Unbelievable!
What you can't count on,
you can't believe is true.
You gave me only the light things.
Make sure to hang
the dress properly.
Or your mother will tell us
both off!
She is so strict
in everything she does.
- What are you doing here?
- The wound was fatal after all.
- Your brother.
- What do you mean, "my brother"?
This is my brother?
But he is dead... Mama!
This is Valentin?
I don't recognise him at all!
They any it's my brother.
Yes, this is your brother.
Take him inside.
- We have to do something.
- To procure the pretty thing for you?
Stop joking! I'm not in the mood.
It's indeed narrow... My God...
Put it in an angle, fool!
Find some money for them!
Or I'll inform on you.
Alright. I can't watch you suffer!
You're forcing me to use
my nest egg.
That's that.
You'll find me at home.
You know the way.
I'll be in the cellar.
- Doctor!
- Where are you?
Here!
- What's that smell?
- The smell of misery.
What a heap? Is this your nest egg?
Help yourself!
So what dues gold smell like?
Gold?
Like sweet cream.
Like a cake with whipped cream.
- Are you hungry again?
- Yes!
Careful! My wings!
I have lo get a closer look at you...
...at your wings, your arse.
Why not just cut me up?
Wagner would be delighted.
A magnificent autopsy specimen!
- Mr. Faust, this Isn't like you.
- No, it isn't like me.
There should he a box up there
somewhere.
You keep all this to yourself,
but we need money.
My old friend Tacitus.
- I've found something!
- Pardon me?
Keep looking, keep looking!
You want to make the whole world happy!
- Some kind of bones!
- Coins!
- A shower of gold!
- Where is the box?
Come to me, my Zeus!
I'll be your Danae!
- Von gabber! Have you found something?
- My aunt's brown purse...
fallen as if from heaven!
- You're tricking me!
- The Devil doesn't have aunts!
- For the Lord, all things are possible.
Let me out of here!
No, I have to change my clothes!
Me, too! Hurry up!
I wan! To gel this over with.
- Then you go ahead.
- No...
...you go, my dear friend,
and I'll wait outside.
Today we bid farewell
to our beloved Valentin.
The Lord summons not only the old...
...but sometimes the young as well.
His earthly life was brief.
But he will be remembered
as a loyal son...
...a caring brother,
and a reliable friend.
- Where are you going?
- I need to see your mistress.
- Do you need help?
- Go, go!
It's highly confidential.
What are you sniffing around
here for?
Frau Emmerich!
You have a visitor.
- Good day, Frau Emmerich!
- I do not wish to see anyone.
It will be of the greatest Interest
to you, dear madam.
Have you taken lemon balm?
It won't help.
I have something hatter for you.
- What?
- A sedative you know well.
When your husband passed,
he left a tidy sum.
You were comforted rather quickly.
- I have children.
You have survived...
...even the unborn child
you killed in your womb.
A true friend gave you a ring...
...and you immediately
forgot your grief.
Caressing gold is a good cure.
I have no gold, as you well know.
Now once again you do.
I was asked to give this to you.
- By whom?
- A good person...
...with a big heart. An angel.
Or perhaps a villain, a scoundrel.
What are you saying?
Just take what your
patron saint has given.
Only the Lord God sends patron saints.
- Not necessarily.
The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh.
Man has two hands. One taketh,
the other one giveth.
What about you?
It has nothing to do with me.
What's wrong?!
He struggles along like
a decrepit old horse!
What, what, what?!
Tell me already!
Did she accept it?
She did. But personally,
I wouldn't have given it to her.
Why not?
I don't like any of this.
You are moved...
...by pure lust.
Although it is hidden
behind a mask of nobleness.
What nobleness! There they are already!
I'm ridden with guilt.
That's also quite noble.
What's the hurry?
One is rushed. Even to the grave.
Time is on the wane.
Death is never a welcome guest.
One always hurries to be rid of him.
This is taking it too far, Doctor!
- What are you doing here?
- Listen...
...this is not my crime, but yours.
Oh dear, you've been offended!
Attention! Close ranks!
But we have no money.
Now we do. Now everything
will be different.
We won't let our heroes be disgraced!
Stop it! End this nonsense!
There are no heroes here!
This is a private affair!
Onwards! I'll lead the way!
Go get 'em!
Splendid!
Hands off! She's not yours!
What is the Professor doing here?
He's not a member of the family.
Boring!
I barely knew him.
He was always fighting
in some war or other.
I rarely saw him.
From the earth we came...
...and so we shall return.
Earth to earth...
...ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
My sympathies. Frau Emmerich.
Be careful with the cross!
- Are you going to the wake?
- No.
A peculiar girl.
May I accompany you,
Frau Emmerich?
- is that him?
- No.
So who is it then?
An eternal wanderer...
...who roams the hills
and vales of life.
Altmayer!
Where are you? Let's go together!
- All of them are buried here...
...my entire family.
- The graves seem somewhat neglected.
Everything will he different now.
What a naughty old man!
Could you introduce me to him?
- Absolutely nut.
- Why not?
My companion is a scholar.
A misanthrope.
He lacks the lightness of being
that we naturally possess.
- What is he doing here?
- He is suffering.
Everything revolves
in its little circle.
I don't like any of this
I'll see you home.
Wolves roam these parts.
For everyone knows exactly
what will lead him lo hell.
- What about my mother?
- She's having a conversation.
What?
You don't know what leads a man to hell?
I'm so tired.
We're nearly there.
But nobody wants to go to hell.
Everyone presumes hell is only
for the bad, not the good.
And that is a mistake.
What plant might I gladden you with?
Celery? Parsley?
Perhaps mandrake root?
There is no mandrake root
round here.
- You should be glad! Oh, a burdock!
- Thank you.
Can you not walk faster?
I have to get to my guests.
Do you know where mandrake root grows?
- No.
- We'd better take the little path.
- Why?
This path is better.
It is a steep path
but it is quite pretty.
- Yes, it truly is.
- Professor!
- I'm over here!
- I can hear that.
It grows below gallows
or near bonfire pits...
Blueberries!
Bonfires in which witches
were burned.
- I'm tired.
We can have a rest.
No, let's keep going.
Women are weatherproofs
one may only admire them.
Why are you so frightened?
You're not a witch.
- Where are the two of them going?
- They cannot run away.
All roads lead to town.
And what is this here?
Verbena.
Or a lily.
Are you really a professor?
And a baccalaureate,
and a doctor, and so on.
But you're not
well versed in botany.
Quite so.
Autumn is coming.
So in what things are you well versed?
The order of the universe...
...the trajectories of the planets...
...the transmutation of metal into gold.
What plan! Is this?
I think.
...It's chickweed.
- The things you know.
Why are only women sent to the stake?
I know that my chatter
can never entertain a man like you.
- But not men?
- You'll be the first man to burn.
You should trust yourself more.
Fine by me!
I dream of the day...
...when I'm finally burned.
The day that everybody
is burned...
...regardless of sex...
...age, rank or merit.
That's what I call equality.
I had a dream about my brother today.
He seemed different
We talked...
...for a long time.
You know so much.
What does death do to a person?
Does he die completely?
Science argues that death exists.
- But life gives the same answer.
- Yes, that's true.
So what do we need your science for?
It's something to do to fill the void.
You, say, probably enjoy
knitting in your free time?
Yes, I do.
Science is something like knitting.
I'm driven by great things.
This earthly round
is too cramped for me
I can neither better
nor convert my fellow men.
- Wherever are they?
They're just talking and talking.
- What about?
- About life and death.
Death is death.
Yes, death still exists.
But soon it will disappear.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm speaking of the future.
But some people are already
on the right path.
And there won't be any unhappy
people there?
No. The unhappy are dangerous.
Quite dangerous.
Doctor! I'm over here!
Margarete! It is late!
Come! What are you doing
sitting there?
Is this a pleasure garden or what?
We must go home!
- I'm coming, Mother!
- Quickly, quickly!
Why are you running round
with your skirt raised?
What an innocent child!
- Don't touch her!
- No groping!
Thank you. Goodbye,
my guardian angel.
- I'll be thinking of you.
- You're shameless!
Up here it's safer, isn't it?
Why are you roaming about?
Think of your brother!
He lies in his grave,
and what are you doing?
- I think only of him!
I know what you're thinking about!
You little whore!
It's a disgrace! A disgrace!
What will people say?
One should never joke with women.
Mama, wait!
That wasn't exactly timely.
Who is he anyway?
Why did you bring the mother here?
It was lime.
You begin in secret, with just one.
And then another.
And soon the whole town will have you!
You know where this will lead you?
What are you doing here?
Come with us!
No, I don't know!
What binds a woman to a man?
Don't you know?
No, I have no idea.
Three things...
...money...
...lust, and a shared household.
That has a cynical ring.
Cynical?
It's strange to hear that from you.
Yet another moralizer.
I have the right to accuse others
of being cynical...
...because I myself am different.
Clean.
Pure.
You're clean, pure?
Who told you that?
Ever since Eve was tempted,
the world has not been pure
it wasn't I who tempted her,
but a distant ancestor.
A snake just like you.
Good clay!
- Are we headed the right way?
- Where are you going?
- To Paris.
To Paris? Paris is that way.
Get in!
- Would you like to go to Paris?
- That's the last thing I need.
- Show me the way.
- I'm tired.
Let's ride with him for a bit.
Someone is lying in here, snoring.
Doctor! Climb in...
...or the best seats will be taken,
as so often happens in life.
Get in, get in!
Come on!
Hey, careful!
Lousy Krauts!
Let's be off! Straight ahead!
I want to get out
it smells here!
- The man stinks terribly.
- Maybe it's a woman.
You'd know hatter than I.
Your little doll quickly took the bait.
How I'd love to spit in your
impudent face!
But I skill have need of you...
...perhaps.
- Together we're strong.
We accomplished a lot today. We made
the family of the murdered men happy.
- Indeed! We made them happy.
You talked lo Margarete rate in private.
- Mind you, thanks to me.
- It was too brief.
Too brief?!
Do you wan! To be with her for longer?
Then it's called seduction.
Good morning!
Selifan, give me my jacket! And teal.
And so it is.
But I want to all the same!
How boring!
I was sleeping.
Selifan, where is my jacket?
We have guests.
- is he a madman?
- No, he's Russian.
- How do I approach her?
You'll have to impress the girl!
But how?
Show her that you can read her
secret thoughts.
- Girls like that sort of thing.
- Stop it!
Even you won't be able to find
out her secret thoughts.
Selifan, kick them out!
Stop! We've arrived!
It's mass you need to stay the masses.
Come on, Doctor!
You're not yet man enough
to deal with those devils.
- What do you mean not yet?
- You must learn to trust yourself.
- Nonsense!
- Your desire to live is great...
...but your strength is small.
- Were you serious...
...a bout reading her thoughts?
- Even you can't do that.
I can't. But her confessor can
I'm not a confessor.
- You could become one.
- Me? Her confessor?
- I feel you have strength.
- You're mocking me!
I'm not mocking you.
I have a plan.
When was the last time
you went to church?
Last year.
Margarete goes a little more regularly.
Nearly every day.
Nearly every day?
So what?
- How is that going to help me?
- You're hungry.
Everyone here is starving.
Continue fighting. The world is big.
And our priest...
...is he also one of your clients?
Well, then.
See you later.
Rather tasty.
I did my best. As always.
Such pretty things.
Where did you get the money for them?
Your student...
Your student pawned off
some of your lectures on somebody.
Although I have no Idea
why anyone would want them.
One doesn't have
to know everything, Ida.
One more thing. Professor.
There was someone here
for you, a professor.
He wanted to invite you to his lecture.
"I asked him, Who are you?
What do you want?"
He said: I want to see
Professor Faust.
- Thanks, Ida.
- You're welcome.
I said: "You have no business here.
Go to the unisity."
"University"!
That's what I said, "Unisity".
- "He's there day and night". I said.
- Yes, It's all so terribly horrible.
- Decent gentlemen sleep at home...
...in their own beds.
Katharina!
I'm busy!
I'll save her.
What do you want, Frau Hagemann?
I want some bread.
- Where were you?
- Everybody has been waiting.
What did she tell you. Adelhelma?
Where is your mother, Gretchen?
There she is.
Where have you been?
They're going to eat everything up!
Margarete, where are you going?
I'm going outside.
There he is.
Where can I make a donation?
It's you! I haven't seen you
in a long while.
How large is the donation?
It's not small.
How hard the uphill road would be...
...in silence. Sweat. And effort...
...if every now and then we did not meet
a rose upon our way...
...that nodded to us.
Look, I'm in bloom!
Please. Come with me.
What would we do without...
...the generous hands
of our benefactors.
He who has no hand makes no list.
Elsa! I forgot my basket
in your house!
I'll bring it by later!
There she is. What a coincidence!
No, it's no coincidence!
I must speak with you. Don't be afraid!
I despise everything coarse.
I know how you feel.
I was there at the cemetery.
- Didn't you see me?
- Let me pass!
I was there.
I'm so happy today!
It's such a happy, important day!
Do you think he is Faust?
He isn't Faust! I am Faust!
He stole all his ideas from me!
- He is a usurper!
- What did he say?
Yes, I'm little Wagner.
I am the great Wagner!
- We believe you.
The very great Wagner!
- Shall I take your measurements?
- I am the great Wagner!
The very great Wagner. I am Faust.
I am Faust.
The great Wagner.
- The very great Wagner.
- Yes.
- I am Faust.
- Yes...
...I believe you.
Yes, of course.
I believe you.
I can prove it to you.
I have...
I can prove it if you don't believe me.
I've done it!
I mixed the essential oils...
...of asparagus and dandelion...
...with a hyena's liver.
And thus I created...
...a homunculus.
I mixed...
...the essential oils of asparagus...
...and dandelion...
...with a hyena's liver.
...mixed it with a hyena's...
...liver.
I mixed the essential oils of asparagus
and dandelion.
What are you doing?
A homunculus! An Ubermensch!
A manmade man!
Show her what you can do!
Look, Margarete!
Look! Say something to her!
Let me go!
Help! Help!
My peace is gone...
...my heart is sore...
...I'll never find it...
...Oh, nevermore.
Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?
Yes, please enter.
Dear Lord,
forgive me my tainted thoughts.
Heel so alone.
And I do not love my mother.
But she doesn't love me, either
I know I'm a had daughter.
And God will punish me.
But her makeup...
...the powder on her forehead...
...her bad breath.
Dear Lord, forgive me and
help me.
Forgive me my sins.
You?
- I met your assistant.
- Did you really?
He is somewhat nervous. Your student.
Yes, he is a philosopher.
May I tell you something?
You needn't reproach yourself.
Take me, for example.
I didn't love my mother.
I found everything about
her nauseating.
Her red painted cheeks.
The powder on her forehead.
Her foul breath.
But that is a sin.
One must love one's mother.
No...
One day she died suddenly.
She choked one piece of cake.
And died instantly.
Can you imagine?
To die from a piece of cake!
With whipped cream.
If you asked me today whether...
...I'd wanted her dead then...
...I'd have to admit...
...that yes, I did.
- Do you believe in God?
Who today has the right to say,
"I believe in God"?
Me.
God is love.
But love knows no obligations.
You don't have to love your mother.
Are you a mind reader?
You're able to read the book of life.
Not the book of life...
...but, perhaps, the book
of one particular person.
There is a custom...
...to pray for the deceased
for forty days...
...while holding
something in your hand...
...that was his
I've never heard of that.
No, there is such a custom.
Doctor, I'm leaving.
Everyone can do it...
...except for murderers.
Would you like to pray
for my brother?
He gave this to me.
What a likeness!
Farewell.
I saw it with my own eyes.
It was the one who kept hiding
behind the fat man.
It couldn't have been anyone else,
Frau Emmerich!
Come here!
I know who killed your brother.
Do you want to know?
It was Faust who did it.
Katharina! Please bring me my cape!
MY sympathies.
Take a right at the south gate
I'll show you the way.
You?
Do come in.
Do come in.
Have a seal.
Have a seal.
Sit down.
I moved the bed next to the window.
For the light... I'm reading.
- I have to ask you something.
- Yes, go ahead.
- Something peculiar.
- You can ask me anything.
- Please excuse me.
- Go on, ask me.
What is this?
A bellows.
Yes.
- And this?
- A retort...
...for distilling mercury.
Is that all you wanted to ask me?
Word has it...
- No... You know...
- What do I know?
Good bye!
Good bye!
Was it you who killed my brother?
Yes, I killed him.
What do you want?
But on the list it says "two rugs."
What rugs?
Where are my Persian rugs?
It seems you picked them up yesterday.
The lady would like to redeem her
Dutch chest.
But it is full of fleas!
Out of the way! Three rugs...
...and 22 % in interest.
- What 22 % interest?
- What about my flute clock?
With the Handel sarabande?
The beautiful clock goes back.
I love Handel.
Wait! We have to...
Where is my flute clock?
Oh, Ferdinand! Tick it off!
- One Christ.
- One chest?
- One Christ. It goes over there.
- Somebody stole the clock.
- How many were there?
- Five vases.
- We're doomed.
- I know.
- We've been found out!
- By who?
The girl told me I was
the murderer.
You have been found out,
not me.
Does this mean she came to see you?
I hope you used the opportunity?
It is not my nature
to use such opportunities.
Stupid! You won't get
another such chance.
You only wasted time
if you denied it all.
How do you know that
I denied it all!
You are the incessant liar.
I always tell the truth.
Is that 507 Well, never mind.
It must have been the mother
who found out.
Take it easy.
So far you haven't been arrested.
Don't worry.
We'll find a way to silence
the mother.
See what a swamp you've
driven me into?
When you're sitting in prison...
...then you'll know what a swamp is.
- Go! Away!
- Stop!
- Don't go!
Move it, I said!
No, stop! This is all rubbish!
Where is my mirror?
- You won't be needing a mirror anymore!
- My clock!
You've run out of time!
Rubbish! This is all rubbish!
- Rubbish? These are your treasures! Go!
- Leave him alone!
Devil!
- Crook!
Move it!
It's an outrage!
Enough, I said!
I want only one night
That's all I want!
One night.
- Only one night. Alone with her.
- All alone?
One whole night.
The things you want!
She shares a room with her mother!
One night.
Please. Just one night.
Why such complications?
You could just Invite the little
doll to your place.
She already knows the way.
After what I've confessed?
What happened to your intellect?
Where is your imagination?
I have no imagination.
I have something better.
You sign here. And Margarete is yours.
What is this?
- This is full of mistakes!
- Oh really?
"With this signature"...
With this, my personal signature...
"I bequeath"... There's something
wrong here.
I. Heinrich Faust, bequeath...
"to the bearer of the letter"...
..."this letter...
..."my sol...
Soul is spelled with a "u"!
- With a "u"! How nice.
- ... "after its natural"...
... "separation from my body". Yes.
Now it's correct.
I've run out of ink!
What a shame!
Perhaps you could use blood?
You were prepared
to write in blond.
Behave yourself!
You're a guest here!
Lousy dog!
What a hideous language, your German.
All the same.
- So what now?
- Now? You'll get your Margarete.
I'll see lo my side of the bargain.
I know where she is.
- Let's go then.
- So impatient!
Fulfil your obligation!
Thank you. Where are we going?
I'll take you to your dearest
by the quickest way.
There is a secret path!
And where is it?
I'll show you.
There is no chimney on my lamp!
This path is underground!
Underground!
- Here it is! Which way?
- This way!
My secret tunnel!
I'll lead the way.
This is my way.
I've never shown it to anyone.
What a devilish tunnel!
But somehow it's easy to breathe here.
A deep well.
My storeroom for cowardly souls.
I'll lead the way. Le! Me through.
Do you still want to do it?
This is all sedimentary cover rock.
As far as I can tell.
You'd better think about
good cover for yourself.
The little one will do you no harm.
But the old hag...
I know how to pacify her.
- Do you want to decapitate her?
- Dear Doctor!
- Rip out her tongue?
- A good herbal tea...
...and she'll fall asleep forever.
Fall asleep forever?
Yes, nice and quiet.
We'll leave them here.
For the way back.
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
The poor girl. The dear child.
There she is.
I just knew it.
This is where all young souls
go when they're suffering.
Go!
Go!
You wanted to save her.
You can save her now.
My peace is gone,
my hear! Is sore...
is there anyone here?
How cold it is here.
Cold.
Why are all these things
scattered here?
I don't understand.
Who did this?
This is his herbal tea.
It's your flask, Doctor.
I have to go.
I have to go.
Now you may enter. No pushing!
Behave in an orderly manner!
Come on.
I'll help you.
There's someone here.
The clock has stopped.
The hands have fallen down.
It's draughty in here.
You're cold.
I have to go.
Those cats again.
I hate cats.
I don't want to...
I don't want to...
Where are my things? What is this?
A straitjacket.
God help me... God save me
I don't want to...
- Well, finally!
I don't want to.
- What is this?
- Your armour.
What are you doing?!
- Where did you get such strength?
- I want to save you.
It's the best armour I have!
A good man needs good armour!
I'm not good! Don't touch me!
I cannot stand violence!
Come to me!
One step and then you're free.
- Where to?
Forward, march!
Your loitering draws Death closer!
Not every murderer
is forgiven his guilt.
It has to be earned.
What sense is there in fleeing?
I must stay.
You must live.
We're people destined for great things.
I wish that I had never been born
it would be best not to be born
at all, my friend!
Much better than finally to die,
fortunate as that might seem.
- What do you mean?
Finally you're awake!
Then go saddle up!
I'm a poor horseman.
But a good man.
Where are you going?
Where, where? There.
You'll like it there. I know it.
- I'm dizzy.
- It's ever the same...
...man wants to fly, yet he can't
cope with dizziness.
You're a man. A soldier.
What? What am I?
In the end. You are what you are.
I don't recognise anything here.
The forester's house was here.
And over there, the mill.
The mill? It's gone.
What do you mean. Gone?
- Very simple.
But the mill can't just...
I don't understand.
Armour becomes you.
Very noble, powerful.
It befits your name: Heinrich.
Which means...
..."mighty wall.
Or just Heinrich the Mighty.
What about your name, Mauricius?
What does it mean?
- The dark one.
- It's a rare name.
Yes, It's a martyr's name.
And a publisher's.
Come! Send the horses home!
They'll find their way!
It is getting tight here!
Why do we have do go through there?
This is the stairway to heaven.
But it might lead us
in an entirely different direction.
Why have you stopped?
What are you mourning?
I'll show you something better.
Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise.
So help me God!
Be careful with my beautiful armour!
Don't scratch It!
It's borrowed.
- From who?
How inquisitive you are!
Must be our theatre director.
And now I'm supposed to amuse
the world like a fool?
You can amuse only me.
There is no one else here.
- Where are we?
Far away and high up!
Very, very high up!
It's so easy to breathe here!
I should think so.
- What is this here?
- Nothing.
- We're not alone here.
Who could be haunting this place?
Maybe the Greeks?
I have some here.
Move!
- I have to get through, too!
- Thank you! I can see...
...you're slowly recovering.
I've had enough of this masquerade.
It's a pity, but alright
in for a penny. In for a pound.
- The greaves, please.
- I'm not your servant.
- Not a servant. Atypical human being!
- I'm going ahead.
- Where to?
- To the left.
Damned boots!
Tell me now, where are we?
I told you,
far away and very high up.
- And what is this here?
- Nothing.
Go look for yourself.
I know...
...you hope to discover
the all in my nothingness.
Let the living go on hoping.
We were forgotten here.
- We are forsaken.
- What are you doing here?
It's your old acquaintance!
- Thank you.
- Let me go!
What do you want from me?
Let go of my hand!
Help!
- Stay here with us.
- I want to leave!
It is freezing here.
Take charge of us.
- You're so warm.
- Lead us into battle.
The war is over.
I don't save you once again.
I don't understand
what they see in you!
Without armour
you're not a general!
- This way?
- Yes. This way.
Let me go first!
What did he thank me for?
Death, of course.
Because life was even harder
for him than death.
I don't understand.
What's there to understand?
Eternal poverty.
Dependency on his mother.
And on his sister's whims.
He was a proud man...
...and all that wounded him.
What a pity...
...that you didn't kill him in battle.
That would have been nobler.
Never mind.
One must know how
to laugh all such things.
What will become of the girl?
She might be imprisoned.
But are we going to save Margarete?
If the old hag wakes up,
we won't have to save her.
- Are we going to save Margarete?
- Of course not.
In any case...
...we'd first have to ask her whether
she wants to be saved by us.
It's different with you.
We are partners.
We have a contract.
So that's how it is.
Where is that smoke coming from?
Wait!
I did everything I promised to do.
- But you...
- It's not enough for me.
- I'm worth more.
- What else do you want?
Another sun? Another homunculus?
Two, perhaps?
It's not enough for me!
- What a spectacle!
- It's a fantasy.
No! You're lying!
This isn't a fantasy!
- How does it work?
- My fountain isn't so harmless.
It's hot!
- Are you happy now?
- How does it work?
I don't need to know.
The Lord God knows.
Come on now. It's dangerous here
God doesn't know.
But I do.
The heat rises upwards...
"...the cold sinks towards the interior"
...of the earth.
Yes, very interesting
I could recreate this in a snap.
Come on! We're leaving!
No! I'm staying!
He wants to recreate my fountain
You want to achieve glory?
The deed is everything. Not the glory.
Let me see your deed at last!
Friends don't treat each other this way I
- it really hurts!
- Crying is good for one.
Even someone like you
must suffer at some point.
What do you know about suffering?
What can be so special
about your suffering?
Soon you'll know for yourself.
Eternal solitude,
and no hope of salvation.
Quiet! Enough!
I already know everything
about you.
You're only disturbing me.
Quiet now!
Pointless hole!
I decide everything here!
It is not yours to decide anything here
Walt! Von can stay longer
if you wish.
Even without a soul.
Leave me alone.
I don't need you anymore!
What is it you want?
Why did you show me those madmen...
...who even in the sleep of death cannot
forget their war?
What have you given me?
Not even money for my ring!
Power, influence...
...one can only seize
such goods oneself!
Nature and spirit...
...that is all one needs...
...to create here, on this free land,
a free people.
But. Seriously now, I have a contract.
A contract?
You signed it!
I have to concentrate!
Leave me alone.
Wait! The soul! Your soul.
- I'm entitled to it.
- The soul?
You signed the contract
with your blood!
Feel free to submit it on
Judgement Day.
No! What are you doing?
That's that then.
Is this for Margarete?
And that is for the mother?
Stay thee a while! This isn't pretty!
Again, again, again, again.
Bad shot!
Bad shot!
Who will feed you?
Who will guide you out of here?
Over now.
Over as if it never was.
Overs what a stupid word!
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Over there!
Farther and farther!
