THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR
Directed by Francois Trauffaut
It was still dark
when the squad car
left Grenoble.
The village is 1 5 miles away.
The ambulance is probably
already there
for it left from Chambery.
I am Odile Jouve.
You think I'm a tennis player?
Well you're wrong.
If the camera
would pull back a little
you'll see what I mean.
Go on, pull back!
Now, you see!
Let's sit down over there.
No, this will do.
I manage this tennis club.
Its members are from Grenoble
and other regions nearby.
They all know each other here
and I know everybody.
It started six months ago.
You might say
it goes back ten years
but it was actually
six months ago.
Houses can be characters
in a story.
In this one, the principals
are two neighboring houses.
One is the home
of Bernard Coudray,
his wife Arlette
and their son, Thomas.
Here they are,
posing for a friend
who was never found.
The second house...
we'll get back to it later.
As you see,
it was still unoccupied
when it all started.
Hi, how are you?
You okay, Thomas?
My boy.
Hello!
-Hi.
Can I help?
No, thanks.
So, you've rented the house?
No, I'm from the
real estate agency.
Mr. Bauchard is the new tenant.
Philippe Bauchard.
Bernard Coudray.
I must make a phone call.
I'm sorry, but the phone
won't be connected
till next week.
Use our phone.
I don't want to disturb...
Please, come on!
-I'll wait here.
If you run into any problems,
be sure to call on us.
There...
Do come in.
Thank you.
Is he our new neighbor?
Yes. Be quiet.
He's moving in next week.
With his wife?
I don't know if he's married.
He wears a wedding ring.
Then, we'll have new neighbors.
Come to think of it...
we'll have to be careful.
No more love-making on the lawn.
We can do it quietly.
No! No more outdoor sex.
Anyway, I always catch cold
from the damp grass.
I hate it! Never again!
Wait for me, Thomas!
Can I carry the suitcase, sir?
Sure, if you like.
That way...
Can I put it down?
Yes. Fine.
Thomas! Where are you?
I think he went to the neighbor's.
Hello.
-Hello.
Is he in your way?
-Not at all.
Thomas,
your pal's waiting for you.
It's funny,
they're both called Thomas.
It's a real mess.
Come in.
You probably know the house.
No.
I've never been inside.
You must meet my wife.
Come down!
That's the trouble with rentals.
You've got to fit your stuff
into the new set-up.
Mathilde, my wife.
The Coudrays.
How do you do?
Bernard. Hi.
Hello.
I'll put the lights out.
Thomas always leaves a trail!
Like the Indians in Arizona.
Some Indian!
Here.
-Hang on...
Damn it!
Did you wake him?
No, he's fast asleep.
Is he asleep?
-Yes.
Their lights are out.
They go to bed earlier
than we do.
The pilot's wife is a real beauty.
He's not a pilot
but an air controller.
Really?
Yes, he works
at the Grenoble airport.
I steer boats and he guides planes.
Isn't his wife beautiful?
I think she's rather unusual.
Well, I think she doesn't belong here.
What do you mean?
Look, we live here because we love
the land, the trees,
the natural environment.
She just doesn't belong here!
Yes?
I know you're alone.
Can we talk?
We can talk anytime.
Sure, but I don't want
to embarras you.
You know what I mean.
What did you tell your wife?
Did you tell her
we know each other?
Did you tell your husband?
Not yet, but I will.
He trusts me,
he's understanding.
He's a wonderful man.
Good for you. So long!
Don't hang up.
Wait, wait...
I'm waiting.
Have I changed much?
No, you're exactly the same.
You sound nasty.
I didn't move in next door
on purpose.
Phillipe wanted to surprise me.
If I'd known beforehand,
I'd have found
a pretext to turn it down.
But since it's a fluke,
let's accept it as such.
I've got to go to work.
Wait! Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
In case you need me...
take my number. Got a pencil?
No. I don't need anything.
Bernard...
Bernard.
What's wrong?
Can't you sleep?
I'm hungry.
Didn't you eat enough at dinner?
-Yes. I did.
So?
-I'm hungry again.
Why sit in the dark?
I'll light up.
What's the matter?
You seem worried.
-No...
but I want to suggest something.
Let's go away for a week or two.
With Thomas.
Like around the 8th.
It's out of the question.
Thomas can't miss school.
Let me get an apple.
Besides,
they're auditing the lab books
I've got my hands full.
No, it's impossible.
Don't eat the salmon.
Have an apple.
The salmon is for our guests.
What guests?
I invited our neighbors over
for dinner tomorrow.
What did you do that for?
Well...
The wife is very charming.
I thought you'd be pleased!
Still...
Do you want me to put it off?
We can do it some other time.
It's too late to change now.
Never mind...
Listen!
It's the cats.
They're fighting.
They're making love
like mad!
So long.
At what time will you be home?
At eight.
-Right.
Hello there!
Just getting up?
-Yes.
Remember to pick up the groceries.
They promised to put them aside...
Don't worry!
-Don't forget!
I won't.
Your briefcase!
Bernard, your briefcase!
Going to work?
Damn it! The door's locked.
I'm locked out!
It's the inside lock!
Go in the back way.
I can do it.
Okay, try it.
Slide over to the front.
Hurry up!
Just press the red button.
Fine. Come on out.
I'm late.
Hurry up!
Remember the store!
Right! I've got the list!
Don't forget
you're coming over tonight.
Dock number five!
Why does the sun circle around?
I wonder what's holding up Bernard.
Here.
-Thank you.
Thomas! Is he bothering you?
Not at all.
Behave!
Mr. Bauchard...
Just call me Philippe.
Philippe, won't you sit down?
No, I sit all day long.
Be back in a second.
I wonder what's happened to Bernard.
He should be home by now.
He's not working late tonight.
Your husband works
on tankers, yes?
He's an instructor
on heavy tankers.
He trains them on a small lake.
The captains take refresher courses
on miniature models.
Miniatures, like toys?
-Not exactly.
They're certainly not toys.
They're actually scale models.
Yes, one-fourth their normal size.
That's about the size of a barge.
Right. Where on earth is he?
That must be him!
Dad?
Give him to me.
Bernard? What's going on?
You could have let me know.
It's Bernard. He can't
make dinner. He's stuck.
Try to get here in time for dessert.
You hear?
All right.
He asks to excuse him.
We're expecting you.
Do your best!
-Goodbye.
I couldn't help overhearing you.
and you were lying.
That's not nice!
Yes, I lied.
It's true.
But I don't make a habit of it.
Well, you were very convincing.
Now, I can blackmail you.
You may buy me off
with a bourbon.
it's a deal.
What will you have?
I don't know.
I'll serve you first.
Do that, dear liar.
Wait... let me explain.
A couple just moved in next door...
and Arlette's already
invited them
over to dinner.
Don't you like them?
That's not the point, but I'm slow.
I've got to get used to people.
Besides, it's a drag.
Tonight we invite them.
Next week they invite us.
It becomes a ritual.
What do they do?
Are they nice?
He's an air controller.
He works at the Grenoble airport.
He's relaxed and phlegmatic,
like an Englishman.
What about her?
I don't know.
She's rather unpredictable.
I think she's the kind
who likes to borrow trouble.
I don't know what you mean.
Look, since you're not going home
you can share my chow.
Oh no, Mrs. Jouve!
Come on, it's an off-night.
I'll just grab a cheese sandwich.
Over my dead body!
We'll share my veal stew.
But first, I've got to feed Benito.
Did you hurt yourself?
Help me up.
My prosthesis turns some men on.
A few days ago,
in Grenoble, a man
followed me in the street for hours.
I tried to shake him but I couldn't.
Finally, he spoke to me.
I might have guessed!
A fetichist!
I'm not surprised.
I saw a movie about that.
The heroine hated a man's hugs.
She just couldn't stand it.
So the man cut his arms off.
-Both arms?
I'm not sure. One arm, or both.
In any case, he did it for love.
So did I. I did it for love.
Really?
For love..?
I heard it was an accident.
It was a so-called accident.
"An accident" in quotes!
What did they say?
That you fell from the 8th floor...
Only the 7th floor.
And by luck, you landed
on a glass casing, just below.
Right. It was in Nice,
and it was above a studio.
If not for that casing,
I wouldn't be here today!
But it's ancient history.
It happened almost 20 years ago.
At the time of the Putsch in Algeria.
I might as well tell you the truth
because I like you.
I didn't fall out.
I jumped out of that window.
That took courage!
Nonsense!
It's not a matter of courage.
I was desperate... and in love.
He jilted me
and went to New Caledonia.
Like an idiot, I kept on hoping
until I heard he'd gotten married.
That did it!
What did he say when he heard?
I made sure he'd never know.
It's just as well.
That's true.
Men prefer not to know
about these things.
They're so right!
By now, I feel the thing
was tragic, but not fatal.
Like the Piaf song:
"I have no regrets!"
Hey there! Are you dreaming?
No, I'm listening.
I'm glad you came.
It's too bad about Bernard.
Never mind, we enjoyed it.
Right! Next time,
we'll invite you.
Fine!
-Good night. -Good night.
Good night.
-Good night.
Surprise!
Do you mind if I walk along?
I want you to know
we had a good time.
Your wife made us a delicious meal.
Naturally, we talked about you.
Is your car outside?
Look, let's get this straight.
That dinner party was her idea.
Maybe so,
but we're neighbors now
in a tiny village.
So let's face it.
Besides, we're adults now,
aren't we?
You've got a nice kid.
Looks like you.
You're surely happy.
Yes, I'm happy.
I mean I was,
until you turned up.
That's why we've got to talk.
Look, I'm not trying
to make you feel guilty...
but don't forget I went through hell!
You couldn't stand me, you left.
Then you couldn't live without me.
So I worked up the guts to quit.
If I hadn't, I'd have gone crazy.
Now that we're both over it,
can't we be friends?
I suppose you're right.
I guess I resent hurting you
as much as I resent you
hurting me.
I'm glad you're happy now.
That's better.
Next week Philippe and I
will invite you to dinner
with Arlette, of course.
Promise you won't let us down.
I promise.
I'll be there like Old Faithful.
How about a kiss?
Sure.
I want to ask another favor.
Say my name from time to time.
In the past,
I could always tell
when you were feeling hostile...
because you never called me Mathilde.
You've probably forgotten.
Mathilde...
Mathilde...
Will you be all right?
See, you just look at the ball.
Look at the ball!
Bernard!
There's your mother.
You okay?
I love beautiful hair,
especially dark hair.
There are too many blondes.
Where? Here, or in general?
Both. It's because of movies and TV
but mostly the commercials.
So, here you are!
-Hello, Odile.
Hello.
Did you drive here?
Are you here for the day?
For the whole weekend.
I'll stay at the Pergola.
Are you crazy?
Cancel the room.
You'll stay here!
Fine!
I need to make a phone call.
He's a gem.
I'd be lost without him.
All the things he's done for me...
Excuse me for not introducing you,
I forgot your name.
I'm Mathilde Bauchard.
We're Bernard's new neighbors.
Of course! I've heard about you.
But you don't seem the kind
to borrow trouble.
Why?
Philippe! Well?
Roland!
I wasn't sure. The beard...
Besides, I'm a little older.
How long has it been?
Four years?
I think it's five.
This is great!
Mathilde! Come!
This is Roland Duguet.
We were teammates
in the Corsica rally.
Without him,
I doubt... Mathilde.
Mademoiselle.
-Madame! Hello.
That's right. We're married.
Congratulations!
We were about to play a game.
No, stay here with your friend.
I'll practice.
A local publisher, isn't it tough?
There are more advantages
than drawbacks,
actually, Bauchard.
And I was fed up with Paris.
Just call me Philippe.
Of course!
I always tend to be formal.
I find it difficult.
Mathilde is beautiful.
She looks foreign.
Italian perhaps?
No, she's from the south of France.
As soon as we met,
I knew she'd be important to me.
I never sought out
the ideal woman
or any woman, in fact.
But when I met Mathilde,
she seemed like a promise.
In fact,
I remember thinking:
"Here is my last chance
for happiness."
Mme Jouve, please.
Hello. Mme Jouve?
-Over there.
I'm looking for Mme Jouve.
Ask the barman. He'll know.
Mme Jouve, please.
Mme Jouve?
What's wrong? Can I help?
No, thanks. I'll be fine.
You seem upset.
Yes, I got a cable, a rotten cable.
But I'll ignore it.
Can't I help?
-No, never mind.
You know you can count on me.
I hear you do children's books.
Philippe is always promoting me!
He says you're talented,
but you lack confidence.
Too true! I wrote a few stories and
illustrated them,
but it's amateurish.
I might be interested.
I want to publish some albums.
What kind of drawings?
Vignettes?
No, I use a margin
and a 2 or 3 point line.
I work in India ink and colored ink,
but I never use
more than four colors
for quadrichrome reproduction.
That's hardly amateurish!
Well, I worked at Okapi's
for 3 months
but that was years ago.
I quit because of illness.
There are new techniques now.
Techniques may change,
but we can always use a good story.
I'd really like to see your work.
Since you've got no partner,
how about a game with me?
I can't. I think I hurt my wrist.
Simple as ever, I see.
It's me.
Let's meet tomorrow at 6 p.m.
rue de la Gare.
Don't forget, at 6 p.m.
I made a phone reservation. Coudray.
Right. Number 1 8.
She took the key. Go on up.
Thanks. First floor?
-Yes.
Sir...
This way...
Come along, sir.
Look at this mess!
You had one just like this.
It was shorter.
You were smaller!
No, idiot!
The styles were shorter.
I bet you forgot our first meeting.
No.
It was at a children's party.
I came through the garden
and saw you
framed through the window.
You were feeding the children
and that did it:
I fell in love with you right there!
After which you declared your love
by getting completely drunk.
You said,
"I'm not drunk, Mathilde.
"I can prove it
by my lucid reasoning."
You reasoned on and on, while
I thought,
"why doesn't he kiss me?"
Don't talk,
just caress my face.
Wait, wait...
I'm waiting.
What's this?
How could you?
Mind your own business, my friend.
I'm not your friend.
I'm your lover, your ex-Iover.
My lover thought
he had a backbone
but it was just a carapace
and when it cracked,
he hated Mathilde.
You're right,
I truly hated you.
for a long time,
but not anymore.
I've changed a lot.
Yes, you have changed.
It was ill-timed.
If we'd met now,
it might have worked.
Well, we've just met.
It's not the same.
Not the same thing.
You're even more beautiful now.
It's true.
We were both too young,
but now we understand each other.
I don't know.
I don't want to know.
We were in love.
No, I loved you.
You were merely in love.
What's more,
you had no faith in me.
"I love you because I love you"...
Well?
wasn't that a good reason?
Besides, you were a skirt-chaser.
I was always intrigued
by the wonders they concealed.
And now?
Sometimes...
You were tender with me.
So were you.
Wait...
Wait...
I'm waiting.
This looks like a battlefield.
Your hair's in your eyes.
I just wanted to see that gesture.
The first time you did it,
I thought:
If he asks me
to sleep with him, I will.
Let's rent this by the month.
Why?
We can get it when we like.
I resent other couples
making love in our bed.
Air-Inter 323.
Next to the right.
Parking B1 .
You're wanted downstairs.
I put him in B1 .
Mme Jouve is taking a plane.
Will you give this to Mathilde?
What is it?
-She knows.
Tell her she can reach me
at the tennis club all week.
Odile's asked me
to keep an eye on it.
It's hard to believe
but she's leaving town
for a few days.
Take care of Mathilde.
I mean it.
Take good care of her!
I will.
Have a good time in Paris.
I've got to get back to work.
Are you in charge
of our take-off?
Spare us the fancy pirouettes!
I see you've allowed
for the captions.
I bet you even estimated
the copy space.
I admit I was tempted to.
Mr. Roland...
That man at the bar,
he's waiting for Mme Jouve.
I told him she's out of town.
He was here this morning.
I'll talk to him.
I'll be right back.
He was snooping around
when I came to work.
It's very strange.
That man...
don't look at him!
He claims he came to see Odile Jouve
all the way from New Caledonia.
From New Caledonia? Really?
-He claims she knew he was coming.
If she had, I'm sure
she wouldn't have left town.
There he goes!
I'll have more strawberries.
Coffee, everybody?
Not for me, thanks.
Then, three coffees.
Don't forget the sugar.
Come here.
Tomorrow at 6.
-No!
Yes! I must talk to you.
-No!
Bernard, can you bring the cups?
I'll help you.
Here's the coffee.
Let's sit over here.
Sit here.
The room has really changed.
We did fix it up a bit.
Wonderful fireplace.
Yes. The piano's a bit bulky.
Thanks.
-Not really.
Thanks.
Sugar?
What's this?
Your present.
My present?
I meant to wait...
-Your birthday? We didn't know...
It's not my birthday!
It's a separation gift.
What separation?
I'm leaving for three days.
Mathilde wouldn't come.
She wants to move
the furniture around.
God help us!
Why don't you open it?
I'm dying to...
I think I know...
We saw it in a shop...
Mathilde adored it.
So we went in.
She tried it on...
I realized I wouldn't dare
wear it in public.
It's a lovely dress,
it's not shocking.
Not to look at, but...
Try it on...
Let them see it.
He's right.
Here? Now?
I'll help you.
Fine.
Let's go up.
This way.
It's really wonderful
to hear Mathilde laugh.
When I first met her
she was as lovely as she is now,
but she never laughed.
At most, a vague smile.
She had just divorced.
Divorced?
A blitz divorce
after a blitz wedding.
What's going on?
It's in the street.
Does this happen often?
Sometimes,
only when a house
looks unoccupied.
It's best to always leave
the lights on in the house.
The neckline's fine. A little...
It's superb. I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
It's not shocking to me.
You won't mind if she wears it
while you're away.
She'll wear it
whenever she pleases.
I'm not a Latin husband.
Can you help me
with the cups? -Sure.
You know that boutique...
I'll see you tomorrow at 6.
Hello.
Where's the key for 1 8?
He got here first today.
Thanks.
What's the matter?
Come in.
Look, Bernard...
You wanted to talk.
Let's talk downstairs.
Why not in the room?
I know you and I know myself.
And I don't like taking advantage
of Philippe's absence.
We need some sugar.
Where is it
-Can I help you?
No...
The sugar.
May I borrow it?
Go ahead, sir.
What's this about a marriage?
I mean before Philippe.
You got married after leaving me?
Yes, I did it to get rid of you.
To forget you.
I was so hurt I decided
to marry the first man
who'd ask me.
He was an idiot.
You married an idiot?
-Yes.
A blissful idiot.
I sensed it was a mistake,
but I had to do it.
It's like the man who says:
I'll marry the first girl I see.
I meant to divorce at once,
but I'd met his whole family.
I was trapped.
It took me 6 months
to get rid of him.
Then, I lived alone
until 2 years ago,
until I met Philippe.
He was determined,
he was patient and gentle.
He waited until I trusted him.
So you yielded
to his British charm.
A few days ago
we talked of you...
It's true, he really loves you
but I can't get over what he said:
Mathilde made a disastrous marriage
to recover from an affair...
Now, get this:
With a violent manic-depressive.
Am I the violent manic-depressive?
Is that how you talk of me?
He simplified.
He got things mixed up.
He simplified...
Simplified...
Look, Mathilde.
Let's forget it.
Look at me and listen.
Why not run away together now?
I know we can be happy.
Did you want me completely
8 years ago?
I was crazy about you,
but I'd rather have died
than let you know.
Why didn't you say so?
Why didn't you want the baby?
You yourself said it was impossible.
That it wasn't right.
That we should wait!
I hoped you'd deny it.
You wanted a child
but not with me...
and you've got one now.
No, we'd better stop seeing
each other.
Take me home.
-No.
Have you got a handkerchief?
Here.
Wait... it's dirty.
I don't care.
Feeling better?
Here. Now it's really dirty.
Thanks, my darling.
Am I hearing right?
Yes, you're still my darling,
even if you don't care.
My darling...
Look, Bernard.
I enjoyed it,
but it was the last time.
Dinner's ready!
Blow on it if it's too hot.
Is it alright?
How was school?
-Quiet... I can't hear.
Hear what?
It's just a car.
How was school today?
I'm cold.
I'll get a sweater.
I think it's in the living-room.
Finish up. Good boy.
It must be upstairs.
Yes, yes...
Very good.
I'm taking two hours off.
Are you sick?
No, I'm fine...
but I can't stay here.
Just get someone to replace me.
Hello.
You didn't reserve for today.
The 1 8 is taken.
I'll give you another.
Okay. Can I make a call?
Yes. This way.
It's me.
Where are you?
-At the hotel.
The hotel?
-Yes, our hotel.
How come?
I was driving by and I thought...
Listen, come over!
No, I can't.
Yes! Come on!
Remember what I said in the car.
Come anyway!
I really can't.
You can't, or you won't?
Neither.
You forget we talked it all over.
It's settled.
No, it's not!
We never have enough time to talk.
How about tonight?
No, I can't tonight.
Is your husband back?
No. Why?
Where were you last night?
Last night? Wait...
I went to see my publisher.
You expect me to believe
you talked business all night?
It wasn't all night.
Don't kid me!
At 8:1 2,
your lights were still on.
At 8:20,
you drove off in your car.
At a quarter past midnight,
the car...
I was showing Roland my drawings.
Are you still there?
Answer me.
You can't be jealous of Roland.
He's not interested in women.
I don't believe you.
You don't?
No, not a word of it.
I don't care.
I'm through with you.
You scare me!
I want you to explain.
Now you're scared of me?
Never mind.
I was just upset.
Is that why you hung up on me?
I hung up
because you insulted me.
Like a cop talking to a thief.
Don't stay there.
Come in.
You're right...
Absolutely right.
With us,
it's always all or nothing.
Sit down.
No...
I'm so tired I'd fall asleep.
There's something else.
What is it?
What did I do?
I hate lying.
Since we've been meeting
I'm living a lie.
I meant to tell Philippe everything
but I couldn't...
I couldn't do it, either.
We can't go on like this.
Next week, we're going away.
That too, is why I couldn't
meet you at the hotel.
Remember, you used to say to me
and it always made me miserable:
Love affairs must have a beginning,
a middle and an end.
It was true!
-You're right.
You're absolutely right!
I'll get a hold of myself.
I won't bother you.
We'll be friends again,
like before.
Like before...
Before what?
I'd better go home now.
I've got to go.
What if Arlette sees you?
I'll tell her that...
That you fixed my freezer.
Yes. no, I'll tell her
I'm feeling better,
that I'm breathing again.
I'm breathing.
Here's my Thomas!
Wait...
I'll give you a push.
What's all this?
I'm cooking.
No cooking tonight!
Call the baby-sister.
We're going out.
A movie, dinner.
Tonight we celebrate!
Some coffee and a decaf...
I'm really glad to see you relaxed.
I'm always relaxed.
No.
-Sure I am.
Not for the past few weeks.
I felt you wanted to be by yourself.
I meant to visit my mother
with Thomas
just to give you a break.
Hell, no!
I'd really like to take time off
and go away with Thomas,
on a real vacation.
Relax...
Look who's here!
You're here, too!
Yes, we decided to go out...
How was it?
-Fine...
Hello, Roland.
Paris is hell on earth!
They're all so hysterical.
I want to face Mme Jouve.
I'm sorry,
the chef's gone.
Then, a salad for two.
That's fine.
-Right.
He's nervous.
Excited, what?
Whenever he sees baggage
he just goes wild.
I see you took the night off.
We saw a movie.
Which one?
"The Walking Dead".
It's a thriller.
I think I saw it.
It's about a man
who's jealous...
For no reason.
His wife's an angel.
I'm not so sure.
The other guy...
the young one,
kills the husband.
No!
The husband commits suicide
and makes it look like a murder.
Yes, I saw it! It's very clever.
He places the knife above
the door hinge...
He stabbed himself.
The knife's in one room,
the body's in the other.
He knew
they'd suspect the wife.
Are you sure?
The knife in one room,
the body in other.
He made it look like murder.
It's explained in the end.
Didn't you hear it?
Sure, I did.
-He was asleep!
With his eyes open.
No, no...
You need a drawing board
now that you're a pro.
Roland told me of a place
in Grenoble. Shall I get one?
No, I'll go myself.
If this little boy was blond,
he'd look like Thomas.
Well, mine has dark hair.
Pictures are fascinating.
I prefer yours to mine.
I'm sorting them: school,
high school, college.
each one brings you
closer to me.
Tell me, Mathilde...
You already knew Bernard?
Look...
You're right.
It's him.
This is the only time we met.
My cousin was wild about him!
Here she is...
Did he love her?
Why didn't they marry?
My cousin's father doted on her.
He checked Bernard's background
and he told her:
Do as you like
but I know his kind.
Easy to get but hard to keep.
You love me?
Will you always protect me?
Come, Thomas... a picture.
Mathilde, we want you in it.
Closer!
You see, we can be friends.
You thought we never could.
Smile!
Friends,
may I have your attention.
I'm not going to make a speech
but tell you the reason
for this party.
In two hours,
Mathilde and I
are going away.
You already know that,
but you don't know
it's a honeymoon trip.
Since we married
and settled here
we haven't had time
for the ritual honeymoon
which will consecrate
our marriage.
And that's what we're celebrating.
It's really great...
Two love birds!
Their plane leaves at six.
I'm taking them to the airport.
Here!
-Thanks.
I'm beat!
Sit down.
-No, you sit down.
Just lend me your knees.
You're radiant
but Bernard looks miserable.
I'd like one of you and Philippe.
Where is he?
-I'll go get him.
Never mind that, Nicole.
Come help me fix my dress.
Need me?
-No, Nicole will do it.
I should have wrapped it around me,
like an apron. I wasn't thinking.
Excuse me.
Mathilde, a call for you.
For me?
-Yes.
There's nobody...
Yes, there's me!
Come to the hotel, later.
That's impossible!
In my car, then.
We must talk!
We've nothing to say
to each other.
We never have time to talk.
Not so loud!
I'll talk as loud as I want to!
I just ask you
not to leave tonight
or to put off
your trip for a while.
I tell you
I must speak to you!
Let me go! You're crazy!
-What's going on? -Let go!
Let go!
You're crazy!
Please, let go of me!
Come on!
Let me kiss you!
He's crazy!
Let go!
Let go!
You're mad at me...
You must hate me...
I'm not mad.
I don't hate you.
You must have gone through hell
but I can't help being jealous.
Jealous of her, of you,
even of your suffering.
And you might have
trusted me enough
to let me know.
What could I tell you?
"Arlette. Our new neighbor
is the dame
"who drove me nuts
8 years ago"?
Why not?
I thought I'd forgotten her.
Besides, I had no idea
we'd see them so often.
A situation like that
is bound to be difficult.
It's funny,
most of the time
she got on my nerves.
I don't understand it...
I really don't.
Arlette...
Come closer, please!
Yes, it was Mathilde
8 years ago.
We were no good
for each other.
It was all a disaster...
A disaster?
Yes, a disaster...
It seemed pointless to discuss it
and we won't.
It's all over!
Arlette...
Are you sick? What is it?
What's the matter?
Guess what...
Yes.
You've improved
in the past few weeks.
With Roland's help.
But there's something else
on your mind
Yes.
We must make new
living arrangements.
I asked Mme Jouve to help us
find a flat in town.
That woman's a god-send.
You know what she did last month?
A former lover of hers who lives
in New Caledonia,
came to see her.
Well, she spent three days in Paris
to avoid meeting him
so he wouldn't see
how she's aged.
You're wrong!
You're all wrong!
That man from New Caledonia
was Odile's only love.
Because of him she jumped out
of a window 20 years ago.
He never knew
that she's a cripple because of him.
She's a remarkable woman,
but he never understood it.
Really?
Well, neither did I.
Men never understand love.
Amateurs.
I love you,
but I don't understand you.
I've never lied in my life,
it's too complicated,
but now,
I'm living with a liar,
sleeping with a liar,
making love with a liar
and I'm in love with a liar.
Come, Mathilde...
Tell me,
what's my name?
What?
What's my name?
-Philippe!
Right. I'm Philippe.
You say another name
in your sleep.
Shall I tell you
what name you say?
No...
Do you remember me?
Sure. Room 1 8.
Could I rent the room
by the month?
No, we only rent by the day now.
We're reconverting to apartments.
Never mind.
Please excuse me.
Did you reverse it by mistake?
The drawing belongs
on the recto page.
Profiles towards the outside margin.
I see...
Do you mind?
I'm tired.
I love your handwriting.
If we do another book,
we'll print your handwriting.
If you like...
Excuse me.
It's alright.
We've got a problem
with the bloodstain.
The drawing is very good,
but the bloodstain is too crude,
too violent for young readers.
I worked out a variant.
You're wrong.
I meant the red to stand out.
If not the drawing's meaningless.
Not really.
It's too morbid.
Does this variant betray
your meaning?
Betray...
I'm tired.
I must go.
I'll call you at home.
Goodbye!
We'll be back soon!
In five minutes!
Hello, Thomas.
How are you? -Fine.
I'm thirsty. May I go in?
Sure.
-Coming?
Can I have some water?
-Yes.
You want some?
-No.
Not thirsty?
What a nice house.
The kitchen, too.
Let me see your room.
Will you show me?
You're giving me a guided tour.
Where's your room?
How lovely!
Come see my toys!
What are you doing?
I like that picture.
What is it?
It's a whale who's crying.
Why is it crying?
It's unhappy.
What do you know
about unhappiness?
Is this your first book?
Yes, although three years ago...
Never mind.
It's my first.
Your first book.
-Yes.
Nicole, there you are...
Can you sign a copy
for my niece?
I leafed through it.
It's very good.
Almost too good for children.
How can you say
a thing like that?
What's going on?
There's a fire-extinguisher
in my car!
Children, go away!
I'll help you.
Do you know how to use this?
Were you scared?
-No...
Wait a minute.
Look at you!
Go and wash up.
Just look at this mess!
Did you hear about Marcel?
I haven't seen him lately.
Did he mention
his blonde neighbor?
Yes, he went for her
in a big way...
At first!
Now he can't shake her.
I don't get it.
He keeps meeting her
in the elevator.
He'll have to move.
That'll teach him.
Never get involved
with a neighbor!
That Marcel!
Later, sir.
Look. I'm in love!
Where's Mathilde?
Did you see Mathilde?
I've lost Mathilde...
Did you see my wife?
I'm looking for Mathilde.
She's over there.
Mathilde.
Mathilde!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What is it, darling?
Answer me.
Your husband's coming.
No...
This can't go on.
No, it can't.
You must eat.
You've lost weight.
I'm ugly...
I'm skinny.
I'm garbage.
I want to die.
What's happening to me?
Your husband will help you.
No...
I want to understand.
I've got to understand.
Contrary to what people believe
a nervous breakdown
is a real illness.
What's more,
the patient doesn't want
to get well,
on the contrary.
Your wife could go home
in a week,
but she prefers to be sick.
Right now, it's her choice.
What will you do?
I'll try to convince her
it's useless to seek refuge
in illness.
By the way,
had you noticed
this coming on?
No, she collapsed,
she simply collapsed.
True, she was disturbed.
Last week,
we were in downtown Grenoble.
There was lots of traffic.
She kept on saying:
Where are they all going?
I'll come get you at six...
Bernard!
-Yes.
I wanted to see you.
You know me,
I hate interfering, but I've got
to talk to you about Mathilde
I don't want to hear about her.
I'll tell you anyway.
I went to the clinic today.
She's in a very bad way.
I'm certain your visit would help.
You can talk to her,
reason with her.
The trouble is
I know her too well.
I'm the last person
who can help her!
You're wrong, Bernard.
You got over it,
but she didn't.
Please, don't insist.
Did you call me?
A man to see you.
-Who?
He wouldn't say.
That's the story.
You can do as you like.
But when I step into her room
the look on her face
makes it clear
it isn't me she's expecting.
This way, sir.
Good evening.
You want me to stay?
You want me to go?
You don't care either way.
Hello, Thomas!
Good evening.
Ask me why I'm late.
Why are you late?
Philippe Bauchard came to see me.
He insisted that I visit Mathilde.
She's in a clinic.
Sleep therapy.
Yes, I heard.
Is she any better?
Not really.
They prescribed shock treatment,
but Philippe objected.
He's right.
It helps one forget,
but there are side effects.
Was she pleased to see you?
I talked,
but she wouldn't answer.
I promised Philippe I'd go back
but I doubt whether it will help.
If I were you, I'd go back.
In such cases you never know
what helps.
She adored him.
When she heard
he was going away,
she said to herself:
I'll wait for him.
Then I decided
to kill my mother!
What?
That's to see
if you're listening.
Back to Mme Jouve.
When she heard
her lover had married,
she opened the 7th floor window
and jumped out.
Luckily she landed
on a glass roof.
That was twenty years ago
and now she's a cripple.
Any comments?
I'd say the lady was lucky.
You call that luck?
Yes. She was lucky to stay alive.
To love another man, perhaps.
Life has more imagination
than us.
You know, one can love,
or be loved more than once.
Only if one is loveable...
and I'm not.
I'm just not.
I seem to turn people off.
What about your husband?
My husband loves me
but he's like you.
He pretends he's listening.
He says:
Turn over a new leaf.
But the leaf weighs a ton!
Nobody really cares.
Sure, you're payed for it!
According to all those books
I should fall in love with you
but you leave me cold.
Something's wrong
with the treatment.
Be quiet. Don't talk.
Instead of playing nursemaid
put new batteries
in my radio, there.
Time for your medicine.
These pills are just wonderful.
This one makes you hungry.
This one makes you sleep.
I've even got one to cheer me up!
If you take two,
you become hilarious.
You should try one.
No, thanks. I'm fine.
You think so?
How's Mme Jouve?
She's very well.
These visits give you a pain, right?
Not at all.
Not at all, but...
See, it's working now.
I'm glad you want to hear the news.
No. I only listen to songs.
They tell the truth.
Even those that sound silly.
Besides, they're not really silly.
You know what they say?
They say:
"Don't ever leave me.
"Broken-hearted me.
"I'm lost without you, or..".
"Let me be your shadow's shadow".
or: "There is no life without love..".
Okay, Mathilde.
I've got to run now.
I'll be back.
Don't bother.
You don't have to.
You can tell them:
Mission accomplished.
The nut is back to normal.
Come home!
Hello, Philippe.
Hello, Arlette.
Did you find a house?
No, a flat in town.
It's very nice.
How's Mathilde?
Much better.
She's her old self.
- To let -
Well, this is the big day.
I saw the doctor.
We're all set.
Good!
You brought the pumps.
My favorite shirt!
It's torn so I brought
the blue, too.
I don't care.
I prefer the white.
Because it's white.
You remembered my raincoat.
Shall I wear the straight skirt,
or the pleated one?
I like the pleated one.
Take me away...
Take me away,
my love.
I had to speak to you...
Wait...
Come...
The squad car arrived at dawn.
The ambulance was already there.
The medics went in
with 2 stretchers.
The coroner's report stated.:
We found 2 bodies,
a man and a woman.
The man was on top
of the woman's body.
His legs between hers.
There was a bullet hole
behind his ear
and traces of blood
on his temple.
An identical wound
on the woman's face
was made by the weapon
in her hand.
The woman's legs were spread.
Her skirt was raised
above her thighs
Her head was turned
towards the window.
The deaths occured at 5.:30 a.m.
The position of the bodies
suggests
they had sex just prior
to their deaths
I suspect that
Mathilde and Bernard
won't be buried together.
If I had to select an epitaph
for them
it would be,
"Neither with you,
nor without you",
but I doubt whether
I'll be asked.
