Halt... Open up.
Just a minute sir.
This man's in a hurry.
Who's he? Where's he going?
Got to catch the Valley Express.
I'm already late. If you'd hurry...
Open the boot.
It's not locked.
Hope there's no bomb in the boot.
You'll find bombs
30 kilometers ahead.
Move on!
Will we reach the station?
If the Lord wishes.
Has the Barrack
Valley Express left?
Has the Barrack
Valley Express left?
It's running late.
How late?
- 8 hours late.
It's terribly cold!
I'll freeze in this cold!
There's not a soul around.
Station master!
You'll have to cremate me!
Where are you running to?
Matches!
Brother! Hey there!
Uncle!
Do you have a match?
Never mind, if you don't have it.
Glad to know you're alive.
What do you think?
Will the train arrive?
If it does come,
will it also leave?
I hope the bridges
are strong enough.
Not built by a dishonest contractor.
Because if a bridge collapses,
we'll be in deep trouble.
You're the limit!
Forgive me.
Taking you for a man,
I asked you for a match.
But you're a girl and
a beautiful one at that.
Forgive me.
Do you have a match stick?
Don't you ever smile?
I mean, it's good to laugh.
Don't tell me your name.
My name is Amarkant Varma.
Only tell me where you were born.
Or a relative's name...
tell me your mother's name.
Maybe you have a dog at home?
No dog? Say something...
Tell me to shut up.
Can I do something for you?
I mean, get you the stars
or the moon? Conquer a fort?
But no match stick!
You're all alone.
Can I get you something?
A cup of hot tea.
Don't go away. I'll just get it.
There's a bomb in my suitcase.
If you move it will...!
Uncle.
Make us some special tea.
Closed for the day.
No, my future depends on this.
Here's the money.
Make a nice cup. With cream.
I'll take some biscuits as well.
The station master said the
train is running 8 hours late.
That's another train.
Hope she's not taking it.
What did you say?
Nothing. You make the tea.
I'll add the sugar.
This must be the
shortest love story.
What's your name?
Where's the boss?
The vegetable market.
You're all cheats!
Not one paise extra!
Am I new to these parts?
Are you from All India Radio?
Yes, but after this fight. Cheats!
Do you have change
for 50 bucks?
Give me 20 bucks.
What? Yes...
No, it's not fair.
It's absolutely fair.
Put this away...
I owe you 20 bucks.
Couldn't talk to you while
arguing, or I'd forget the abuses.
I knew it would be you.
Don't throw the cigarette. India
can't bear any kind of wastage.
What do you think of the last
50 years of India's independence?
What progress have we made?
What freedom? We have no freedom.
Village leaders got only more
powerful and started fleecing us.
Has free India made any progress?
No. The central government threatens
us and keeps us cowed down.
Atrocities are inflicted
on the poor and innocent.
And you say we are free!
Is this what freedom means?
Louder.
No progress at all.
We have progressed.
No way!
Do you feel India has progressed?
Yes.
India is the best.
Have you ever met these
terrorists or their leaders?
I have two children.
Don't want to see me happy?
I'm going to meet them.
Are you crazy? Why?
For an interview.
You won't return alive.
I already told him that.
We work for the radio,
not for the newspapers.
We don't have to
sensationalise news.
They are dangerous people.
It's my job to find out
after 50 years of independence...
...what is the average
Indian's mindset?
For that you need to get into
the jungles and meet with them?
They are citizens of our country.
And are upset.
We must find out why,
and what they think.
It's impossible.
You won't find them.
We've spoken to them. The jeep is
on its way. Didn't you tell her?
Yes. Have you made
all these arrangements?
Actually, last night,
he saw some trees...
Since then he's been screaming
to see either trees or...
You don't find trees in Delhi.
I have to give you something.
A cup of piping hot tea.
Will you have it here or
prefer to go to a restaurant?
Or there's a good joint...
Move out of my way.
Maybe you haven't recognised me.
We met at the railway station.
I asked you for a match.
Match?
You were covered in a dark shawl.
No.
Look, I don't know you.
You are mistaken. You must
have seen somebody else.
Wasn't that you?
Not to you.
Can you see anything?
I see the gong of death!
Don't be afraid.
Listen.
What is it?
Brother. Yes?
Sounds like a female.
What's your name?
I wanted to ask if... you...
What's your age? And since when
are you doing this? Sister.
I've 2 wives and 8 kids.
I'm fed up. Why do you do this?
Yes. Come soon.
We are. Let me drink the tea.
Don't pester me.
Don't be angry now.
This is for the radio.
You won't speak in my tongue.
But I must speak in your language?
First of all I wanted to ask,
you look just like us.
Absolutely normal.
What did you think?
What's your aim?
Independence.
From whom?
Your government. India.
Why?
Why?
I mean why?
India became free 50 years ago.
Many promises were made to us.
Not one was kept.
We have been oppressed.
Yet the nation is yours.
No. You feel Delhi is India.
The states in the far flung area
have no meaning for you.
Because they are small, not big.
Delhi cares about places
that have vote banks.
Terrorism...
We are not terrorists.
Where do you get weapons from?
Where did you get this courage?
Where do you get weapons?
Anywhere.
So China and Pakistan help you?
These weapons come here and you...
I can't tell you any more.
You've given guns to little kids.
Made them terrorists
only for your selfish motives...
That is too much!
He can join us.
The same courage and dedication.
If you lose your job at the radio
station, you can come and join us.
It is night at the station...
He was waiting...
...for the train,
but the rains came.
Playing like a child.
Piercing through the sky.
The trees were swaying as if
they had lost their senses.
The tin-roofs danced in
gay abandon with each other.
Such was the fury of the sky.
As if it would drown the world!
In the midst of this, he saw
somebody on the dark platform.
Brother, do you have a match?
A gust of wind blew the
cloth off the stranger's head...
A girl.
Dark black, but little eyes.
High cheek bones.
A flat nose as if somebody
had pasted it on in a rush.
One look and he decided to save her
from the villains and carry her away.
But he had neither horses
nor were there any villains.
Forgive me. I thought you were
a man and asked you for a match.
Her answer. Nothing.
Her eyes... full of magic.
Not even a smile.
Why doesn't she ask something?
All of a sudden...
As if pearls are falling...
She says... tea.
Today is going to be different.
Meaning? Amar is
looking after everything today.
He gets hot tea in a floral glass.
He runs hard.
So as not to spill any.
But a train that would be offended
to halt at this little station...
I looked at the train. I didn't
know whether it was mine or hers.
The guard showed the red
along with the green flag.
I ran towards the train.
The train left.
She too left.
Here.
Is a rupee stamp sufficient?
I'm standing here. Just a minute.
Can I talk to him?
No local calls.
I know.
The meter is not working.
Will this do?
Make the call only if
you have the change.
All right.
Twenty rupees. Full rate.
Join politics.
This is wrong. You've met me twice
and yet, refuse to recognise me.
Stop following me.
No.
You will have to.
Why?
I don't like it.
I don't believe it.
I...
What's the problem?
Is it your parents, caste,
community... religion?
Or the two gangsters in the train?
I can even talk to them.
Even if I have to use my fists...
It's not that.
I don't like it. Leave me alone.
You don't like me?
Hope you won't follow me now.
It's done!
Did you talk?
Yes.
Have you eaten?
Yes.
Who is it?
Now where are you going?
I'll be back.
Go anywhere. As if I care.
Go away!
Will you come with me?
I'm not what you think I am.
How do you know what I think?
I've found you with great difficulty.
How can I let you go so easily?
Either you tell your family.
Or I'll talk to them.
Think it over and tell me.
What do you know about me?
Nothing except that I love you.
With all my heart.
Surprised? Worried?
Angry?
I don't believe
in one-sided love.
There must be something between us.
The only difference being you're
not willing to accept the truth.
And I do.
What's the matter? No courage?
The truth...
Leave me alone!
Answer a question of mine.
Then I won't bother you.
You don't know anything.
I've come to find out.
You are very wrong.
Why don't you understand?
You don't tell me anything.
How can I understand?
I am married.
Now you won't follow me?
To whom?
The man with you in the train?
Yes.
One moment.
Nothing.
How can I love a married girl?
Infatuation, not love.
Get in. Your books must be
on the table in 5 minutes.
What do I do?
Forget her.
There's no shortage of girls.
I don't mean that.
I must apologise to her.
Then do so.
It's necessary.
I must apologise to her.
She's come.
Is she the one?
Why has she brought this gang?
You wanted to apologise to the girl.
So why are the men coming here?
Her husband.
Two husbands?
You have 2 wives.
There's a lot of difference
between a husband and a wife.
Listen, we want to talk to you.
Pardon me?
We want to talk.
Yes?
In privacy.
Talk here.
There's no need to worry.
Come on.
Go ahead. I'll tell
madam you'll be late.
Why don't you go?
I must tell you
some things clearly.
I'm a government servant.
If anything happens to me,
the matter goes to the police.
And also to the government.
I also have quite a few
terrorist friends.
I know the leader very well.
Don't listen to him.
I was a bo xing champ at college.
I can throw a bottle in the
air and break it with another.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
What do we do with him?
What do you mean?
So you're a policeman?
I'm not a policeman.
I work for the radio.
Look like a policeman!
What do you do?
Why are you talking to him?
Drag him out!
Let us talk.
What are you doing here?
Why are you asking me
so many questions?
Want to get a girl married?
Pull him out!
Don't touch me. Just talk.
And you behave yourself.
Explain to him.
We live in the hills.
We have some rules and customs.
It will be better if
you leave the girl alone.
What if I don't?
I told you not to touch me!
I didn't know she knows you!
I told you not to touch me!
I didn't know she was married!
In any case, your
women have 5 husbands.
Our sisters don't marry outside.
Is she your sister?
And yours?
She's my cousin.
Is she married?
Did you see him?
Yes, there.
The rascals threw him here.
Stop! Back.
Where?
There!
Got beaten black
and blue for her!
Now do you intend
to work or not?
What?
Says no.
You won't forget that girl.
Yes?
Her...
What's he saying?
Marriage...
She's not married.
She's not married?
She's not married!
She says they've left.
They'd come for 2 months.
Where have they gone?
I don't know.
When did they leave?
Some time ago.
Are you the girl's grandmother?
She says the girl was lovely.
I wish I was her grandma.
From where had they come?
From where had they come?
From the city.
Doesn't she know
where they've gone?
Don't know.
She knows nothing.
What's she saying?
The girl was good, boys useless.
Don't know what they
always talked about.
Only the girl would run around.
Attend to the phone.
Why can't you?
Amar?
Mother, it's brother on the line.
How are you? Talk to grandma.
Give me the line.
Ask him why he hasn't written!
I'm growing even more old!
Grandma is growing older!
When is he returning?
Come back soon.
Give me the line!
We are very worried! The newspapers
publish some terrible news everyday.
Take care of yourself.
Let me also talk!
Your Dad's friend
from the army, Mr Nair...
...is bringing his daughter here.
When should he come?
After 5 years.
When are you coming?
May you live long.
One minute.
Bring something for me.
It's not a local call.
Give it to me!
That girl doesn't come these days.
Do you know the number the
girl would dial from here?
I have a record of all the
numbers dialled from here.
Can you tell me?
Why not? But Why?
I had a fight with her.
I wanted to talk to her.
I don't give out numbers like this.
It's a government office.
What office?
Keep this.
No!
Yes?
What code is this?
Yes, it's almost over.
I'll assume I'd lost
my head for a few days.
But don't tell anyone.
Pay up!
Move aside.
The army shot a running man.
I'm from All India Radio.
I want to know what happened.
Hurry up.
Isn't this a violation
against human rights?
Human rights! Ask him... He was
blowing up school kids with RDX!
Recognize me?
Your husband is not to be seen.
Sent him to thrash somebody?
I don't have a husband.
Are you looking for one?
Who are you?
Why have you come here?
Come to cover the festival?
And you?
I'm with him.
His wife? Whose kids are these?
Are you my wife?
She's my wife.
We've been married for 25 years!
Wife! Let me knew if
somebody is to be thrashed.
Give me a hand. Help the kids.
Mother this way.
Where are these people going?
To Kargill.
How long will it take?
2 days.
The route is long. Let's walk.
Throw carefully!
I'm talking to you.
Stop!
What do you want?
Some answers.
I've been betrayed.
I was beaten up and
dumped in an isolated spot.
And today I am your husband?
Don't you think I'd have some
questions for you to answer?
By what name do I address you?
Real or false?
Who were those men?
My brothers.
Just as Rajiv Gandhi is mine? Why
did you lie that you were married?
If I hadn't, would you have left me?
No.
That is why.
Don't try to act innocent.
I know you're not as
innocent as you look.
Will I dance to your tunes
all my life?
Your game is exposed!
You love to tease boys.
Know what we call girls like you?
We call them fast.
You really hate me.
Yes; with all my heart.
Look into my eyes and say that.
Here, take some water.
Haven't you ever seen a girl?
Where are you going?
Call back your husband, too.
Let's go back.
A storm is raging.
There's some innocence
still left in you.
Everyone has gone
to a cave nearby.
Sometimes, somebody is ahead
at others they follow behind.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Tell me what happened!
You are in tears.
What is it?
Can't you speak?
Has this happened before?
Has this happened before?
The more you try to hide it,
the more it will torment you.
Don't hold your feelings back!
Please move aside.
Come with me.
One minute.
Do you follow Hindi?
Yes, a bit.
I want to marry her.
When?
Right now.
Excuse me, he's mad.
What have I said that's crazy?
Just because I want to
marry you?
Will anybody say something
stupid in such a holy place?
But you never asked me.
Then I'll ask you now.
Will you marry me?
No.
I don't have the time.
Don't have the time?
Suppose we do get married.
Not now. Now we don't have time.
Suppose we get married.
What do you think...
Will we be happy together?
Lots of love and happiness?
Then we'll fight. Break heads.
But let me make one thing clear.
I won't accept defeat.
You'll have to make the
first move to make up.
You won't?
Meaning, I'll have to
apologise to you?
But once the kids come, no fights.
No, they will be involved, too.
Really? How many kids
will we have?
One?
Two? Three? Four?
Eight?
But they have to resemble me.
Look like me.
Then you keep them!
If not me, should
they look like you?
This flat nose!
This flat nose?
Didn't anyone ever tell you
only your smile is all right?
Do you know what it
means to hit like this?
You like me very much.
Hitting like this...
...means you love me very much.
This means you can't
live without me!
I'll die.
Really?
Just like this.
Who is asking you to die?
Say you love me.
I've no time.
Don't desert the old lady.
Why didn't they take them along?
Left them with us for nothing!
They understand Hindi.
And the language of the heart?
If they don't leave us alone,
when will we romance?
What's wrong? Not sleepy?
I am, but I won't sleep.
Why? Are you scared of me?
My family taught me the one who
sleeps in a strange land loses all.
You are scared.
No.
Do you have any idea
what fear is?
Now we won't argue or fight.
We'll just talk.
What do you like the best?
Answer quickly. I'll count to 3
- 1, 2...
Mother's hands.
Mother's hands. Second?
The pigeons of the village temple.
Third?
Poetry.
A local song?
What do you dislike the most?
I don't like you getting close.
That's a lie
Your laughter and mischief.
The zest in you.
Wrong. Actually you envy me.
Yes.
You tell me what you like.
First I'll tell you
what I don't like.
I hate this distance between us.
All that is hidden within you.
And I hate your eyes the most.
However hard I try,
I can't read anything in them.
Now I'll tell you what I like.
I like your eyes the most.
Because however hard I try,
I read nothing in them.
There's so much hidden in you.
I like that very much.
And I like this
distance the best.
Because if not for this distance,
I would have no excuse to get closer.
Go to sleep.
Just sleep?
With your mouth shut.
Some people are like names
written in the sand.
Just one gust of wind
blows them away.
Go!
Go away!
This aim of our revolutionis the freedom for our country.
This aim of our revolution
is the freedom for our country.
For this, we will sacrifice
our bodies and our lives.
We also accept...
...our commander and his aim.h
We will sacrifice ourselves
for the attainment of these goals.
We do solemnly swear.
The time draws near.
The passport is ready.
The entry passes
have been arranged.
The dress rehearsal
is on 23rd. Friday.
What about the car passes, etc?
Don't use them.
I'll play you a song...
Any song of your choice.
My choice?
Has my stuff arrived?
It's on the table. Take it.
Okay.
This song is for Dinu and
his friends and... that's all.
Have you fixed up the house?
Plan out what you need.
Be careful.
You've come?
Amar has been waiting impatiently.
Kids!
May I say something before you do?
Can I talk informally?
Whatever...
There was a boy I loved.
He too loved me.
In college. 
One spoonful of sugar?
He found a job in Dubai.
And when the question arose;
Dubai or me...
Is that his name?
No, he is.
That means an idiot, an ass.
I'm telling you this because
our families want us married.
And I don't want you to...
Don't worry about that.
By the way, even I went
through this.
Love or lost?s
Both.
Did the girl ditch you?
Yes.
Didn't you feel like
slapping her hard?
I felt like wringing her neck.
And killing her!
Shake!
They feel the promises made
to them were not kept.
The bigger states have
grabbed their rights.
The cause for this
are the politicians
Who feel they are not important.
These rumours have been spread
by nations across the border.
We've invested money in the north
east area without expecting returns.
Then where does the money go?
Businessmen or middlemen grab it?
They are all hand in glove!
Is this for the radio?
Yes. All India.
Food.
I don't know.
One last question.
Who is responsible?
Politics or the politician?
How can we celebrate
50 years of independence...
When there are so many problems
in the border states...?
I mean, did you just love
that girl quietly or...
Did something ever happen?
I don't want an answer.
I just wanted to see
if you get shocked.
If I ask you the same question?s
Sure. But what do you think?
I feel you talk too much.
And also at this moment,
there's lettuce on your nose...
But 80%% of the girls of today...
Before marriage... 
So you're from the remaining 20%%
What else? I didn't have the guts.
Tell you something?i
Looks like you're from the 20%% too
Thinking about that girl?
No.
Is that true or a lie?g
Lie.
Forget that lie.
Tell me a lie about me.o
What lies can I tell about you?
That I'm very beautiful.
I'm wonderful, and so on.
You're very beautiful,
wonderful, and so on.
You do lie beautifully.
At home, everybody
must be waiting for us.
To see if we say yes or no.
So if you don't like me,
you can say so. So will I.
But a yes...
I want to talk to you. Stay there.
I want to talk to you.
Stop! I want to talk to you!
Please forgive me.
Hope you're not hurt.
What's the matter?d
Where are you running off to?
Strip and check him.w
What is this?s
He's swallowed it!
Take it out!
Forget about her.
She's just a dream
I thought you loved a girl.e
But you were chasing a man.
Are you a normal man?
Hope you're not...s
I thought might
as well ask. No harm
This way. Your purse.
Kim was caught in Connaught Place.
God knows how.s
The police even found his cyanide.
And he swallowed it.w
They have come!
What are kids doing here? Go up.
So what have you thought?
We had lunch and were
returning in a bus, Dad.
When a man started running.
Amar ran after him.
I ran after him and in this
running, we couldn't talk.
We only want to know yes or no.
How can we say anything so soon...?
We've just met...
I accept.
But ask her once.
What do we assume?
Say yes!
Answer her! Say yes!
I won't say anything.
Please.
No!
She accepted!o
Look at his body. Blood red.
His eyes have turned blue.
His tongue and lips are the same.
There will be deposits of
potassium cyanide in his stomach.
Could he have survived?
He may have died in 10 minutes.
There was a 40%% chance if
a malnitrate was administered.
Have you seen this?
Looks like some notation.
Find out.
Look up the yellow pages.
Check every music shop
in the vicinity
God knows what the police
must have got out of him.
I'm sure he won't divulge anything.
He won't say a word.
Stop crying.
He was like her brother.
There are no brothers
or sisters here.
We haven't come here to cry!
He wouldn't like your tears!
He was a soldier who was
martyred in the battle!
He didn't die as
somebody's brother.
Now what will we stay here and do?
We'll do something.
Getting engaged?
Then you'll get married.
And you'll have children too.
Then they too will get married.
They too will have kids!
One day you'll become
an old granny!
And you'll have to see the
same man's face every morning!
She's here!
Where are you going?
Will you let me go
only after I tell you?
Yes!
I'm going to meet the groom.u
No! Not allowed!
Do you know what
I'm called at home?
No.
Hitler!s
I'm going to come here
after marriage.
If you don't keep me happy...
Where are you going?
To meet the bridegroom.
No mischief before marriage.
I was going to tell him just that.
What is it?
I saw nothing!
What's the matter?
Something urgent.
Go on.
I forgot.
I remember.
What is it?
You'll be stuck after marriage.
If you want to change your mind...e
Think about it.i
Come soon. Guests have come.t
Sure, I'm coming.
Must I come in the nude?
Don't bother him.
Who has come?
Have I come at the wrong time?
Why have you made them
stand outside the house.
Bring them in, I say.
Come in, child.
We've been thrown out of
our rented accommodation.
We have no place to stay.
We can't even go back
to the village.
Sister's calling you.
Go away.
I can't understand where to go.
Congratulations.h
Can I get a job? 
Any kind of job.l
I can do a bit of recording.
I've also worked for radio.
I'll do any job in All India Radio.
Even a temporary one.
Preeti asks where's the groom;
Has he got cold feet?
My son get scared?
Mother, this is Meghna.
She'll stay upstairs.
Have her luggage sent there.
Where do you work?
The wedding is on our heads
and you're inviting strangers...
I listened to you and
got ready for marriage.
They're my friends. So what?
She's coming!
My grandson is getting married!
Congratulations to you too.g
Who is that girl?
The one in red.
She's working with me
in all India radio...
I just asked. Forget it.
This is your room.
Come in. I'll take it.
This is...
My Papa.
This was his room.
Is he in the army?
Was. He's no more.
May I leave?
Wait for me. I'm coming!
Edit it and show it to me.
I'll come back in a minute.
The certificates you'd asked for.
And my bio-data.
The photocopy is with me.
You desperately want this job.
Then answer my questions.
Why should I get you this job?
Why did you leave me?
And why have you returned now?
Will I get the job only
if I answer these questions?
Forget it. Come back here.o
What's the point in wanting
something not in your fate?
There's no sympathy in your heart.
Don't you love me?
I can't answer this...
I've spoken to the ST.
You'll get a temporary job.
Go out to the second room
on the left.
Go on.
And listen... wipe your tears.
It's a casual job.
Temporary broadcasts.
Got the parade duty?
I'll get it.
Does Amar suspect anything?
No. He's very innocent.
There's no suspicion in him.
What else is in him?
And you?
What's in you?
Anger.o
And? 
Ideals. And?
My future.
And?
Courage.
Have you forgotten
why you came here?
Do you remember what our people
have been through?
I remember everything.
Love is into xicating.
It's not made for us.
Why don't you sing?
You look so pretty when
you smile. Or you're glum.
When I was 8, my smile left me.
What's hidden in you?
Nothing. Just unhappiness.
Goodness me!
Not good to be so sad!
Like Preeti, find
yourseld a good boy.
We'll get you married too.
What can I do if it's not fated?
What fate? We carve our own fate!
Welcome.
Go and call Amar.
He must be upstairs. Call him.g
Suppose we get married.
What do you think?
Mummy is calling you.
Coming.
But no fights
after the kids are born.
They too will be
involved in our fights.
Coming!
One? Two?
Three?
More.
Eight? Had it!
But the kids will be like me.
Eyes like mine.
Then keep them to yourself!
Will they look like you?
This flat nose!
This flat nose?
Didn't anyone ever tell you
only your smile is decent?
Know what hitting like this means?
You like me a lot.
Hitting like this means...
You love me a lot.l
This also means that
you can't live without me.
Say yes just once.
We'll go far away from here.
Say yes just once.
They are calling you downstairs.
Look at this. It's beautiful.
I've called Amar.
Come here, child.
I'll call Preeti.
Who knows where she must be.
Try it on.
How will we know otherwise?
Bring the mirror.
She looks just like a bride.
Tell us if you have a groom
in mind, we'll get you married!
How are they? 
It's a marching tune on the tuba.
Did anyone buy a tuba
from you very recently?
Yes. Who wants to know?
Who was he?
An old man.
He came a few days ago.
Here's his address.
Near Jama Masjid.
Quick!d
To the back lane!
Search every house.
Sir, they've escaped.
No!
There's a call for you.
May I come in?
Yes.
I am frightened.
I'm getting married.
So far, I was happy.
But as the day draws close
I feel...
Will I be trapped?
Everything will be fine.
Really?
Yes.
Amar and you...
You'll be happy.
Are you sure?
You are responsible.
If anything goes wrong,
I'll question you.
Be informal.
Stay with me till the wedding.
Sensible girl.
Tied you to her apron
and slipped away.
What about the recording?
How is your leg?
And did you find the dog?
The recording?
In a while.
Kids wait for so long?
I'll just arrange it.
Need a wheelchair?
Definitely not!
Watch where you go.
It will be done in half an hour.
In half an hour.
How come you dropped by suddenly?
My second wife's mother
has passed away.
I fought and got myself transferred.
I brought my 2 wives, kids and the
leftover mother-in-law and came here.
Heard you're getting married.
Checked everything?
Now you'll understand my problem.
Good day.
Good day.
Send this with the
tape to Bangalore?a
How did she come here?
No, it's not so.
It's not what you think it is.
Getting married but keep
your beloved in your arms.
You're also giving her a job!
And she stays in our out house.
What? In your house?
May you go to hell! You...
If you've spoken your bit,
may I speak? Yes.
I don't know why she left me.
I don't even know why she returned.
But I know it's not for me.
I want to find out why.
Now may I speak?
Yes.
Throw her out immediately!
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Why not?
Because I can't do it!
Then do one thing.
Leave either one of them.
Don't ride 2 boats
or you'll drown!
Learn from my experience!
Think it over and tell one of them.
What will happen to them?
Because of us,
they will be ruined.
They are not bad people.
What wrong have they done?
Their lives will be ruined!
They trusted us.o
Gave us shelter.
Is what we're doing right?
The innocent will be killed.
Don't you ever doubt yourself?
There is one aim to our revolution.
There is one aim to our revolution.
Independence for our country.
We'll sacrifice everything for it.
We sacrifice our bodies for it.
Our dreams. Our souls.
And impartially accept...
...our commander...
And every command of his.
For the progress of our revolution.
We'll sacrifice ourselves.
We hereby swear.
How many were they?
About 3 men and 2 women.
How were they?
What do you mean?
From where were they?
Bengal, Assam?
That I don't know.
What's this picture of an army
vehicle doing in your studio?
A customer asked me to make a copy.
Why?
That's his business.
I won't give it!
It's mine!
She's talking to a man!
You're quietly listening!
If grandma hears...?
She's talking to her boyfriend!r
They have to meet at night.
Please be seated.
Yes?
I've seen this man.
This was published some days ago.
I saw him just yesterday.
Him?
No, the one who was chasing him.
You know him?
I broke my leg thanks to him!
My dog almost died!
My father always said...
Who is this man?
I don't know.
What's his name?
I don't know.
Don't lie. The lie
detector is connected.
Who are you?,
Who are you? And in what
capacity are you asking me this?
How many others in your group?
I don't belong to any group.
I told you I work for
All India Radio.
I know nothing else.
You can't leave this room.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm also a government servant.
My father was in the Indian army.
And my grandfather fought in
the freedom struggle in IN A.
And I too am worried for India.
Who is he? Where does he live?
Where has he come from?
Why does he stay here?
I know nothing.
Then why were you chasing him?
Because if somebody abuses,
beats you and then runs away...
Won't you follow him?
Why did he abuse you?
I don't know. Go and ask him.
He abused me! Hit me!
And you don't say anything
to him instead catch me!
I am extremely sorry.
I had called you to talk
about your station director.
It's our job. We have to do it.
I don't need to wait...?
Definitely not. See him out.
Did you see Meghna?
The new fair girl with small eyes.
Who stays with me?
She came, smiled a bit.
Shukla took her with him.
Parade rehearsal?
Of course.
Drive faster.
Take another cab if
you're in such a rush.
I have this pass. Drive on.
They will still create a scene.
They do it everyday.
You'll have to drive around.
Come on.
Didn't I tell you?
I know!
Where are you taking the car?
I know sir.
Can I go from ahead?
Yes, that way.
They always do their work well.
And trouble the citizens.
Turn right.
I hope you're not a terrorist.
Drive fast!
This is wonderful!
I've left in a rush.
I thought you...
Where are you going? Come here.
Who are you?
Who are you and why
have you come here?
Don't tell me any more lies!
I'm fed up of your lies!
Why did that boy
run away on seeing me?
Was it a co-incidence
that I saw him?
Tell me the truth.
He is dead
You came home and
didn't ask for any job.
Why did you ask for a job
in All India radio?
I chased you like a madman.
And you used me!
Why did you do this?
Why are you doing this?
So much of hatred?
Such bestiality!
Would your parents approve?
You talked of difficulty.
You talked of your
mother's palms in the temple.
And what do you do?
Make bombs! Kill people!n
The kind of life I've lived...
...you haven't seen what I have.
You sit in Delhi and
play songs on the radio.
What do you know of our
difficulties for the past 50 years?
We're being deceived
for 50 years!
When we ask questions,
we are silenced.
You know nothing!
What do you know?
You feel the revolution has grown
but you're not to be blamed!
Lives are being taken
and you have no hand in it?
The way we live...
We have no other alternative.
Dad! Dad!
Death at every footstep.
Day and night. Every moment.
They kept killing us!
We kept shedding our blood!
There was blood everywhere!
Screams of people still
echo in my ears! Stop it!
Sister!
Do you know it?
Sister! Leave her!
Run away!
Little one run away!
Leave her!
Have you ever smelt death?
We pledge our bodies and souls...
With impartiality... 
Every child has the
same story to tell.
Maybe worse than mine.
I'll give up everything.
My family, job... everything.
Come with me.
Forget all this
ever happened to you.
We'll go away from here.
We'll run away. 
Won't you do this?
I can't do it.
So terrorism...
Now what do you want to do?
How many do you want to slay?
Come, I'll accompany you.
We'll kill people together!
You still don't understand.
I can understand what
must have happened.
But I can't understand
what is going to happen.
How many will you kill?
- 20, 30, 50?
Will this ease the
suffering of your state?
Will happiness return?
I know what you went
through was wrong.
But because of the
mistakes of some...
...you can't take it out
on the whole country.
A few peoples' mistakes?
What are these mistakes?
Killing innocent people?
Or setting entire villages aflame?
Raping a 12 year old child!
If you can't answer our struggle...
If you can't give us justice...
Is it a crime to ask for justice?
Little kids wield guns and
their parents don't stop them...
Why? Because it makes no
difference even if they die!
There's no other way of survival.
Your army is your protection.
Quiet! I know the army well!
You would have fought
each other to death!
Each little village
fighting against the other!
Had it not been for the army, this
nation would be torn to shreds!
You think the army helps us?
Who else will save you?
Your terrorists?
Will you protect your
nation with terrorism?
Your nation not mine.
What will you do?
Will you kill people or
blow the country with a bomb?
You will celebrate the joy
of 50 years of independence.
And the world will watch
how we've been oppressed.
- 50 years...?
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
You used me...
Yes!
What do you mean to me? Nothing!
What your heart says, what you think
your marriage, family, children...
They hold no meaning for me!
Tell me what you're going to do!
What?
What will you do?
What is this?
Don't touch me!
Leave me!
What are you wearing?
What are you wearing?
Tell me what this is!
Let me go!
Teasing a girl! Rascal!
You may go, madam.
Sit inside. I'll show you!
Three men and two women.
They seem to be using old trucks.
We have found the chassis
and engine number of the trucks.
To remove suspicion from that
spot they used 555 timer...
...along with RDX.
What does all this mean?
Sir, January 26...
Hang on!
Amar here.
You called at the right time.
I was bathing, I'm wet...
Listen to me.
No, you listen!
I'm wearing only a bathrobe!
Listen, this is very urgent!
Of love or...
Don't talk nonsense!
Meeta and Meghna
who are staying with us...
If they return don't
let them leave.
This boy is our brother.
If you suppress this matter...
He hit a constable!
I know.
But everything is in your hands.
No!
It concerns a woman!
Yes, I'm fine.
I'll explain when I return.
Let me talk...
Bail paid.
Now if you slap a policeman
I'll lock you up! Go away!
Somebody teach him manners.
Sit quietly.
Keep it away.
We want to search your house...
talk to your son.
Your information is wrong.
This is impossible.
We have enough proof.
My son is an army officer's son!
Some people were staying here.
Where are they now?
They were Meghna and Meeta,
friends of Amar.
Where are they?
They were around.
And Amar?
There's a wedding in 4 days.
There are hundreds of jobs.
Clothes, jewellery, food...
Must be doing something.
Why did Meghna and Meeta leave?
If you have any letter or
newspaper or anything at all...
Or any phone call that they
made or received over here.
Give me anything of theirs
that you have or remember.
It would be a service
to the nation.
If I find out my son is a terrorist
I'll call you myself to arrest him!
What's going on?
Where are they taking her?
Take care of everyone.
Keep walking quietly.
One word and you'll drop dead!
You can't get away...
The CBI knows everything.
They must be behind right now.
Where are you taking me?
Come to the police station.
I'll show you.
Imbecile!
My sweet...
Flirting with a girl!
Impressing a girl!
You...!
I won't leave him!
I'll lock you up!
Move behind!
Hit me, will you!
Hit me? Now hit me!
Let go!
Who is it?
Muster up courage and come to me.
Are you hurt?
I am not dead.
And I won't die...
Till I find you.
Please come to me.
Where are you?
You can't come here.
You're my life.
Try to understand.
Don't you feel our love is
more important than terrorism?
I'm too far gone... it's too late.
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.
It's not too late.
What are you doing?
Don't shoot!
I need permission sir.
All the army cars used in the
parade are to be checked.
What are you saying?
I even want to check the tanks.
That will salute the President.
This is not a fair demand.
Sir listen to me.
We've already lost a Prime Minister
because of the body guards.
Security never harmed anyone.
This parade has been
going on for years.
What do you think of yourself!
All the security units be revamped.
This remain secret till the morning
of January 26, nobody must know...
Who is in charge of which gate...
Can this be done, General?
Yes, sir. It will be done.
What happened to you?
I have to find Meghna.
I have to stop this.
Why don't you understand?
It is beyond us.
The CBI considers you a terrorist.
They've taken mother for inquiry.
Mother...?
Please give this up.
I have to find Meghna.
I have to stop her before morning.
You can't forget her, isn't it?
She will listen to me.
She won't do anything if
she sees me. I can stop her.
Then why have you come here?
You should've gone to Sundernagar!
What do I do about
these wedding cards?
Should I write Meghna's name
next to yours?
What about Sundernagar?
Why should I tell you?
I don't know there's some
place behind the bus stand!
So? Who told you about this?
The children and I overheard
on the phone. Happy?
Now answer my question.
What do I do about these?
Search him!
Who are you? What are you doing?
He's not a terrorist!
What will happen tomorrow?
I'm not one of them.
I don't know if they make bombs.
Where are the explosives?
I'm not one of them!
You gave them shelter.
Did you keep her in your house?
Yes or no?
Yes, she had no place to stay.
Did you get her a job?
Yes I did! Because I love her!
We accept that.
Now listen to what I say!
Did you meet terrorists
in north-east?
Yes, I did. But that's my job!
Interviewing them is your job?
Hold him.
I'm telling you, sir!
What are you doing?
All will be well in 24 hours.
You'll sleep for 24 hours.
I don't have 24 hours!
And we'll get the truth out of you!
What is going to happen?
How many people do they have?
What is their plan?
Keep shaking him awake and
ask questions every half an hour.
Call me up on the wireless
as soon as you get an answer.
- 2 men in the corridor
and 2 men in the room.
Yes, sir.
Where has he gone?
You search here.
I'll take a look down there.
- 7 tomorrow morning...
The military van will be in place.
- 7. 15...
Jeep in position with remote.
I'll be at the block
security post by 8.45.
- 9. 15... I'll enter with the
dancers by the security gate block.
Here's my security card.
If Meghna makes a mistake
I'll be prepared.
- 9.30?
I'll be ready.
- 9.45...
Everyone will be in position.
The President will take
his position at 9.58.
The parade will begin at 10
At 10.40...?
The dancers pass before the stage.
- 10.42...?
The wires of the sound
system will be snapped.
In this confusion, I'll reach the
stage with my all India radio pass.
I'll be before the television camera.
Independence of our state.
Don't fall asleep!
Stop!
Stay awake!
Get up!
Don't fall asleep...
What are you watching?
My last morning.
Are you frightened?
Not since last night.
You're looking beautiful.
Do you know why? Because nobody
is more beautiful than a martyr.
It's not essential that you
take birth in a better society.
But it's essential that you
give others a better society.
Who are you?
What are you doing in this van?
Where is Meghna?
Where is Meghna?
Where is she?
Don't come forward.
Why?
Don't come close to me.
I once said, I'd never leave you.
I have come.
This is the truth.
Don't touch me!
Don't come with me
if you don't want to.
Take me with you.
Take me along.
Take me along.
Take me too along.
You love me.
Just once say that you love me.
Just once say that you love me.
Say it just once!
