(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
Keith?
Yeah'?
I just want you to know
that I'm not with you
because you're a disgustingly rich,
successful businessman,
or devastatingly handsome...
Yeah, I know.
It's 'cause I've got
a nice personality, haven't I'?
But me handsomeness
is a faculty though, innit?
Ooh, yeah. I mean, of
course, it's a faculty.
You know, my knees tremble with lust
whenever I come near you.
Do they'?
You're the kind of hunky sex god
I've been looking for all my life,
the man I always hoped I'd marry.
- Honestly'?
- Well...
- Not really.
- Eh?
Everything I'm saying is coming out
of your dirty little mind.
You don't honestly think I'd let you
seagull my bangers in real life, do you'?
- Yeah.
- This is a dream.
Your girlfriend is stood there watching us.
- Hiya, Keith.
- Rosie!
Oh, it's fine, I don't mind you
sea-gulling Kelly Brook's bangers.
She's one of your "would if you could"
top-three celebrities.
- Plus, you're never gonna meet her.
- She's right.
You're never gonna meet me.
She's right, you know'?
You're never gonna meet her.
This is all just a dream.

Right, the thing's in. Hello, who is it'?
It's Rosie.
Rosie, it's Keith.
I was just dreaming about you.
Aw... Was it a romantic dream'?
Yeah, I sea-gulled all over your bangers.
Aw...
- I love you.
- Yeah, I know.
Say it then.
I do you, too.
I miss ya.
I'm comin' back tomorrow.
And, anyway, Rosie, who else can make
a mashed potato sandwich like you'?
Is it nice?
(COUGHS)
(MUFFLED) I'm having it

It's the best mashed potato sandwich
I ever had in me life.
Listen, I've got to be down here for

It's gonna take Securipole

Okay, the reason that I've organised
this corporate dinner tonight
is to tell you both that,
in two and a half days from now,
I'm going to t'Big Apple.
New York?
No, other Big Apple, London.
It's time to take Securipole global.
America, Australia, maybe even Torquay.
Why d'you want to go to London now
when we've only just set up'?
Don't you think we should try
and sell some poles around here first,
and then, you know, expand slowly'?
Rosie, the only thing
that's gonna be expanding slowly
is my big, fat tallywacker in your mouth
when we're making sweet love. (LAUGHS)
I always wanted to go to that London,
but me dad said it was likely
that I'd get stabbed.
No, that's not likely.
- Or bummed.
- That won't happen.
Or bummed and stabbed.
- By a terrorist.
- That might happen.
And, Douglas, whilst I'm away,
look after Rosie,
I'm making you the main man.
You're gonna be me.
Rosie, don't you worry.
Whilst I'm down that London,
I won't look at another bird,
no matter how FAF they are.
"FAF"?
KEITH: Fit as Fuck.

gentlemen please calm down?

Thanks very much for letting me

Aw, I bet you say that

No, I don't. I've never
met any Spice Girls.
Oh.
Uh... This is me.
Oh, don't you pay. I'll get this.
Don't worry about that.
It's not every day you meet
your favourite Spice Girl, is it'?
Okay, thanks. Cheers.

- Bye.
South Bank, please. Oh!
Sorry. I thought the cab was free.
No worries.
I've got to say, you're
my favourite Spice Girl.
I bet you say that to all the Spice Girls.
No, I've never met any Spice Girls.
Well, I have, I've just met the Baby one.
- Nice. Emma.
- Yeah, Emma Bunt-on.
So let me tell you a bit about myself.
I sell Securipoles.
And tell you what, 'cause
you're a Spice Girl,
I could do you a good deal,
I could stick one in your front passage,
or I could stick one in your back passage.
It's up to you.
Oh, do you know what'?
I think this is where I get out,
- but it was so lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Yeah'? Good luck in London and everything.
Thanks.

I can't read Spanish.
What does it say'? Tistipi...
Tisipiti.
Piss on titties'?
This is my problem!
The device is revolutionary,
but name of it is shit.
It's a bit shit.
Nobody wants to buy a bloody phone
with no buttons with a shit name.
This bloody... This phone.
What are you doing?
This phone is curse of my life.
However, as far as I am concerned,
I have never seen the public
presentation as captivating as yours.
Oh, thanks.
And the cavalier attitude
was sound as a pound.
So, my friend, please, please, I beg you,
take the phone and do what you will.
You can give me 8.2% gross corridor
if you make any money.
But I'm giving up on this product.
So, it's all yours, Keith.
(LAUGHS) What do you say'?
Well, I've got me own business,

If it was a thousand,
and not two and a 'alf thousand.
I'm totally screwed if it's
two and a 'alf thousand.
One million poles'?
There must've been a
mistake with the order.
We clearly haven't ordered a million poles.
Well, a Mr Keith Lemon
ordered them, apparently.
- Who from'?
- Uh...
- E. Steve Incorporated.
- Who's E. Steve?
Evil Steve. He is an evil bastard.
You know Hood-less Harry, don't you'?
He had a plumbing business.
He couldn't make the payments
on 100 U-bends he'd ordered.
Not a million like what's going on here,
a mere hundred.
Well, when he couldn't pay up,
he had to pay in skin.
(MEN LAUGHING)

Aye, foreskin.

Hello.
I gotta say, our Gary,
thanks for coming down to see us.

Oh, aye. Did it look like him'?
No. Melted him down, turned him into...
(SHOUTS) ...Beyoncé!
I don't know why I came to London,
I've not sold one Securipole.
The only thing you'll sell down here,
Keith, is your soul.
And you'll end up in the shit.
Yeah, it's all gone tits up. Not you, love.
You can keep 'em where they are.
I don't even know why you wanna move
to London in the first place for anyhow.
They can't even understand us.
You can't even order a drink.
Go on. Go and try.
Excuse me, can I have a Coke, please?
Did you just call me a cock'?
No, I said, can I have a glass of Coke'?
You want me to put my arse on your cock'?

I'm strawberry blond, aren't I'?
Let me give you a bit of advice
that my dad gave to me

He said, "Never..."

"...animals or any other
kind or livestock."
Fair do's.
If it works out well,

But if you change,
I'll let you know you've changed.

Um... We've got a bit of a problem.
What's up, Rosie? A distinct stress
in your voice, what's the matter?
Have you ordered some, um...
Some poles'?
Yeah, I did, I ordered a thousand.
Good job I did, as well,
'cause I've already surpassed
my pre-sale expectations.
- How many noughts in a thousand, Keith'?
- Huh?
- How many, Keith'?
- Uh...
A few of those circular buggers. Um, six'?
Six noughts is a million!
You've ordered a million Securipoles
from Evil Steve.
Rosie, don't worry
because Evil Steve isn't that evil.
He's friends with Fairdo's Mick
and Nice Tariq.
"Fairdo's Mick"? "Nice Tariq"?

Hey, they aren't weird.
You wanna worry about Weird Paul.

Um, well, like the text

- Fixer?
- Yeah.
I find people who are down and out
and I try to help them.
Now, before we get started,
I just have some preliminary
questions for you.
If you were to describe your situation
in one word, what would that be'?
Oh.
Well, basically, I've always dreamed
of being the next Richard Branston.
You know, Branston Pickles.
I'd like to be a household name
with my product, Securipole,
which I've accidentally pre-ordered
a million of from Evil Steve,
that's because I'm numerically dyslexic.
And, so far, I've not sold one,
so I won't be able to pay him back,
and he's probably gonna
cut me foreskin off.
And I don't even got one,
I had it removed with I was three.
(MURMURS) Foreskin.
I'm as smooth as a
dolphin's beak downstairs.
I don't know what else he's gonna cut off.
And also, me girlfriend,
that's not really me girlfriend,
is my girlfriend,
but she ain't really me girlfriend,
but she is me girlfriend, she's pregnant.
Don't know how that's happened
because I swear I pulled
it out at the right time.
And I've got verruca.
And I think that me piles have come back.
It's like a shitake mushroom
hanging out of me asshole.
It's like I've got an ingrown toenail
in me chocolate starfish.
- Have a look at that. See there'?
- (GAGGING)
(COUGHS)
- By it hurts. The pain's excruciating.
- Okay.
Just in one word, Keith.
Fucked!
DELIVERY MAN: There's one thing
I don't understand.
If Billy Ocean is Keith's dad,
why isn't he called Keith Ocean'?
Because his name's Lemon.
He took his mother's name after Billy left.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
And I can see his Caribbeanesque features.
So, is anyone gonna sign for these poles'?
Oh, will you just take them away'?
We've obviously made a mistake
with the order.
Hey!
Don't shoot the messenger.
I'm not the bad man here.
- It's Evil Steve.

Apart from this hi-tech phone,
where the buttons have been
replaced with no buttons,
but the fella that gave it to me
couldn't even give it away,
apart from the one he gave to me,
he gave them all to me.
Argh!
- I got it!
- What?
What if we remarket the phone
with a new identity'?
- What do you mean'?
- Put your name to it.
You said you always wanted
to be a household name.
I do.
Hopefully, they'll buy it
and you'll make enough money
to pay Terrible Tony.
- Do you mean Evil Steve?
- Exactly! Problem solved.
Yarussky!
More importantly, though,
do you think we'll have
enough money to
pay for a cock enlargement for meself'?
Uh...
It'd be like a gift for meself.
It'd be like a Christmas present.
Birthday present.
St George's Day present.

The new Lemon Phone

Small-time Northern English businessman
Keith Lemon has gone from rags to riches

But what is it that makes the phone
so desirable?
It's got a lemon on t'back_.
And that makes it good because...
I don't know.
And there you have it,
the answer is they just don't know.
- Lemon on t'back.

It's also to me for all I've achieved
during this short period of time.
And thanks to Kelly Brook.
I can't wait to have full-on
penetratitive sex with you
in your minge hole
to constipate our relationship.
So, Kelly, come here.
More importantly, how has a ginger tit
like him pulled Kelly Brook?
He's not ginger, he's strawberry blond.
Strawberry blond, my arse!
HE'S ginger!
And it looks like Kelly Brook
likes a bit of ginger minge, too.
I thought you was his canny bird.
- I am.
- Well, I'll tell you what,
I've got a big gaff here.
It could do with a woman's touch.
Or should I say,
I could do with a woman's touch.
That's funny 'cause I thought
you and Dennis was an item.
What have you been telling her'?
That was just a bit of fun.
We were at polytechnic.
We were experimenting.
Do you and your boyfriend not think
that my boyfriend is not gonna come back
and kick the shit out of you'?
What'? Does he know jujitsu'?
Well, it won't work on us.
'Cause we're Church of England.
- Will we kill her now, boss'?
- No, we won't kill her now.
We'll miss I'm a Celebrity.
You get the vat turned on,
get it all hot and bubbly, like.
We'll watch a bit of telly,
then we'll decide what to do.
Scream! I said scream!
I wanna hear you scream!
In your dreams!
- Dennis, shall we get some ice cream?
- Yeah, what's your favourite'?
Rum and raisin.
I'll let you smear it all over me

polytechnic days behind you, man.

about all your problems back in Leeds.
This is nothing but bad karma, Keith.
Bad, bad karma.
Archi-cock-blocker, I am calmer.
I'm as calm as a cucumber, unlike you.
All you've done is complain
since I've been an overnight success.
Which is perplexing, really,
as it were you who fixed it all up.
Don't remind me.
You know, I made a big mistake, Keith.
The only mistake you made, brother,
is not getting yourself a costume
for tonight's toga party.
Toga party?
And because I'm a nice and kind man,
and remembered...
- Here. Put that on.
- (GRUNTING)
- This is a napkin.
- It'll be big enough for you.
- But...
- Now excuse me.
I've got a phone call to make.
Hello, is that Yorkshire Bank'?
It's Keith. How much money have I got'?
Don't you see
that all this is too good to be true'?
Archidoodles, if things appear too good
to be true, then they probably are true.
That is the saying.
Now excuse me, I'm on t'phone.
Can you confirm that for me, please?
MAN: You are currently
one billion, five hundred million
- and eight pounds in credit.
- (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)
Kelly Brook. I've just been on t'phone
to Yorkshire Bank.
I've got one billion and a half
and eight pounds.
I thought I had one billion and a half
and three pounds.
I've just made five pounds,
sat in t'hot tub. Ooosh!
Hey, man. You should ditch this broad.
She's nothing but trouble, if you ask me.
Ditch Kelly Brook?
Have you been glue sniffing?
- Wow! That's so much money.
- Yeah, I know.
Here. You can have some.

or some tampons. Girl things.

I want you to touch me in places.

when I blabbed up all over the place.
That's never happened
to me before ever in me life.
Anyway, as a token of my apology,
I've got you a present.
I'd like to present you
with these two piranhas on plinths.
If you don't like them,
you can take the plinths off
and you can wear them as earrings.
Just bring 'em up to your ears.
Let's see what they look like.
Oh, yes. They look beautiful.
It really brings the colour
out of your breasts... Your eyes.
- Lovely. Do you like 'em'?
- Yeah, they're, um... unique.
Yeah, they're unique, aren't they'?
Piranha fish earrings.
Ever so unique. I like that word.
So that means it's a good thing,
doesn't it'?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I love that film, Piranha 3D, me.
I think it's amazing.
Yeah, all the blood and gore and stuff.
That's my kind of film.
You seen Rambo? You've not seen Rambo?
I'll tell you what happens in Rambo
if you've not seen Rambo.
What happens in Rambo
is he tries to get into a small town.
They won't let him into the small town.
So he goes into the small town anyway.
So they arrest him
and take him down to the station,
do his fingerprints, but you can see
he don't want to do his fingerprints.
Then they put him in the shower
and they hose him down,
which I thought was a bit homoerotic.
And then he punches
that ginger guy from CSI: Miami.
Then he breaks out. Then there's
a passerby on the motorbike.
He takes his motorbike from him.
And then he goes into the forest
and he climbs up a tree.
Then he falls out of the tree.
He cuts all his arm up.
But, lucky for him,
he's got a Rambo knife.
It's got loads of trinkets in it.
It's got needle and thread in there.
So he sews up his arm like that
and he goes further into the forest
being chased by the locals.
A bit like Frankenstein.
They've got torches and stuff.
Then he goes into a tunnel.
And we see loads of flashbacks
of when he was in Vietnam.
So we know he's not in trouble.
And then he gets
loads of rats on his back.
And he burns the rats off his back.
Then they blow up the tunnel.
Then he goes out of the tunnel.
Then he goes into the town
that he tried to get into before.
And he meets his old sergeant
and then he says...
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)
You can't tell what he's saying
but you can tell that he says,
"They drew first blood. Not me."
Hence the title of the film,
First Blood.

- Excuse me. I'll get over.
(WHIMPERING)
Keith! Keith!
What'?
Keith, it's me, Douglas. Douglas Orange.
Listen, we need to take you
back home to Leeds.
Evil Steve has kidnapped Rosie.
And only you can save us
by giving us money for t'poles.
Listen, firstly,
I know about eleven Douglaseseses.
And you're not one of them.
Thirdly, I don't know
anyone called Rosie.
There's only one woman in my life
and that's Kelly Brook.
And she loves me
and we fuck like spider monkeys.
- (SCOFFING)
- Keith, it's me, Douglas.
Security! Take this dingbat away.
If you want money, here.
Go buy yourself a new suit,
'cause you look low-quality.
Daft tomato-face! (HISSING)
- (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)
- You used to be my friend.
More than that,
you were like my brother!
Well, not as close as that,
more like a cousin
that I saw at family occasions
like Christmas and birthdays
and funerals and stuff.
Once we celebrated St George's Day,
but we didn't know what it meant.
- You don't know what St George's Day is?
- I love St George's Day.
I love St George's Day.
That is my favourite holiday.
That's my favourite holiday, too.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
I wanna fingerblast you right now.
Are you listening to me, Keith Lemon'?
You listen to me.
Will you kindly leave my lavish palace?
(GLASS SMASHES)
- Go on, get out, you wronghead!
- That's harsh, man. Totally un-PC.
You can shut up and all.
There's far worse things
I could've called him.
Like a stupid spas...
- (ALL GASPING)
- What did he say'?
I wasn't gonna say
what you thought I was gonna say.
'Cause... I was... I was gonna say...
(SPEAKING MOCK FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Which is foreign for, "You silly idiot."
- Now go on, flip off! Go on, flip off!
- Damn moron.
Go on, get out of it.
(DOUGIE GRUNTING)
You used to be the main man.
Now you're not the main anything.
I, Douglas Orange, am not friends
with Keith Lemon any more.
Good.
- And you know what'?
- What?
- I'm not your fixer any more.
- Oh.
I'd rather eat shit
than hang out with you.
Then go eat shit, you shit-eater.
Go get some shit and put it in a pita.
A shita. (CHUCKLING)
- Go on. Get out, you dicksplats.
- Piss off!
- What was that all about'?
- I don't know.
But I'll tell you what, Kelly Brook.
I will let you finger my arsehole
as a part of lovemaking.
And I have never let anyone
stick their finger up my arse.
WOMEN: Aw!
I lust you... Love you. Fancy it'?
- Come on, then.
- (WHISPERING) Up there.
Come on, we're having a party. Party.
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)
(SIGHING)
(LAUGHING) Douglas.
Who would win in a fight
out of all the Expendables
in that film, um... The Expendables'?
Sylvester Stallone, obviously.
He's t'leader.
- But what about Jason Streatham'?
- Crank.
- Jet Li'?
- Easy Jet.
- Mickey Rourke.
- Mickey... (IMITATES CLUCKING)
What about Arnold Schwarzenegger'?
The only governor
is Sylvester Stallone. (ECHOING)
(GROWLING)
- I've been stitched up.
- (BELL DINGING)
ANNOUNCER: Hello, coach travellers.
Here's a bit of news for you.
Tonight's in-coach movie
is a Sylvester Stallone classic.
Wait for it. It's none other than...
Wait for it... Rambo!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)
It's the moment you all waiting for.
We got the main funky guy
and the main funky girl!
It's "K" for Kelly-Lemon!
Hey, bro, they're doing karaoke.
You gonna have a go'?
Nah, mate, singing's not for me.
MAN: We love you, Keith!

(IN A DEEP VOICE)
What's happening to my face'?
WOMAN: Oh, my God, look at Kelly!
What's happening to my mouth'?
Out of the way.
Shift, you. Shift, shift.
I'll tell you what's wrong
with your mouth, love.
It's that cheeky little badger's
fault up there.
Luckily, I still communicate
via fax and pager.
Sometimes pigeon.
But I bought my mother
one of those phones.
Your auntie, Keith.
Your very own flesh and blood.
And look what it's done to her face.
- WOMAN: Eurgh! Mingin'!
- Proper fucked.
And now I'm wracked wi' guilt.
(SIGHING HEAVILY)
I'm sorry, Auntie Fanny.
That's her real name, Fanny.
It's like American for "arse."
Now you might all think
I'm another relative
who's come out of the woodwork
because he's doing well for himself.
But you'd be wrong.
'Cause I'm here to tell you
the dangers of that phone.
The Lemon Phone. The Keith Lemon Phone.
Keep using it, and you'll all end up
with a face like her up there.
- Kelly Brook.
- (LAUGHING MOCKINGLY)
And don't get me wrong, Kelly, love.
I used to wank my eyelashes off
over you.
But not now, Kelly.
Not now you've got a face
like an old, blistered pisspot.
(IN A DEEP VOICE) My career!
My face, my beautiful face!
I'm sorry, Kelly.
No likey, you're wonky.
- I'll never work again.
- KEITH: It looks nice.
Just put a bag on your head,
it'll be all right.
Look at 'em! Look at 'em, Keith.
They're all changing!
- Look at their faces!
- (SCREAMING)
Van Outen! Tiny Strides!
Oh, for fuck's sake!
- Moylesie!
- What?
Holly Willoughbooby, Nostrils!
Odd-looking fucker blowin' trumpet!
- Gino D'Acampoff.

Peter Andre and Jason Doneover.
You're in the shit, Keith, lad.
You're in the shit.
Let the bell meet the end.
I'll see you in the sequel.
(IN A DEEP VOICE) I'll never work again.
Let's get him!
- Wanker!
- Yes!
Hey, when you see that Keith Lemon,
you tell him I'm gonna
kick his frickin' ass.
My mouth is Hoff-centre.
Pictures are coming in
of once loyal fans
who are now infuriated
with the northern businessman.
(INDISTINCT YELLING)
(SCREAMING)
Kushvinder, what the eff is going on'?
It appears as if they are blaming
your phone for their wonky mouth.
MY Phone?
- Didn't you PAT test this'?
- Of course I did.
Pat tested it and she said
it was bloody brilliant.
- Isn't that right, Pat'?
- Oh, yes, it's bloody marvellous.
It's got spirit level,
it's got Sati-nav,
a melodic selection of ringtones!
I mean P-A-T.
Which stands for
"portable appliance testing," you dingbats!
Time to go home.
Thanks for the 8.2%
gross corridor cheque.
How do!
(LOUD SCREAMING)
- He's going for the roof.
- (INDISTINCT YELLING)
Help me! Help me!
Somebody, help me!
Kelly Brook's gonna kill me now!
- She's gonna cut me knackers off!
- (COUGHING)
Archi-bee-gees, they're gonna kill me.
Me dream has turned to shit.
It's a nightmare!
Look, I came up here
for some peace and quiet. 50 fuck off.
(BANGING ON DOOR)
KELLY: We're gonna rip
your balls off, Keith Lemon!
She sounds pretty angry to me.
Here's Kelly!
- Looks like you haven't got long, man.
- I'm gonna kill you, Keith Lemon.
I've ruined everything.
I had me chance and I blowed it.
There's no other choice
for a self-centred bastard like me.
- I'm gonna kill meself.
- Just do it.
I'm gonna throw meself
off this building,
- which I once owned.
- Bye-bye.
I'm going to smash me skull
to smithereens.
I don't give a shit.
And a fox might come along
and lick me eyeballs clean out!
- Adiós, amigo.
- (PANTING)
I'm sorry, Rosie. I'm sorry, Douglas.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)
(SPRAYING)
Rosie, despite my devastatingly
handsome looks and me tallywacker,
which is as thick as a Coke can,
why are you with me'?
Well, everyone thinks
they know Keith Lemon,
this self-obsessed know-it-all
who really don't know anything.
I do know some things.
But I know the real Keith Lemon.
Kind, thoughtful, lovely man
who makes me smile.
So are you gonna do me white bits, then?
Leave your white bits. I like 'em.
Fair do's.
(GIGGLING)
(BANGING ON DOOR)
- What am I doing?
- Killing yourself, man.
Sylvester Stallone
would never kill himself.
He'd go back and fight the enemies
and save the day.
That's what I've gotta do.
I've got to go back and save the day.
More pacifically, I've gotta save Rosie.
- The love of me life.
- You are a good guy.
- I knew it!
- Thanks.
(THUDDING)
- What's wrong'? What's wrong, Archimedes'?
- (MOANING)
Are you having a eptileptic fit?
I'm gonna fucking kill you, Keith Lemon!
Is there a doctor on the roof'?
I need a doctor!
- Shit! It's Kelly Brook.
- There he is, the ginger twat!
I'm not a ginger twat.
I'm strawberry blond.
Well, you're still a twat!
(GROANING)
Cheese and rice!
(EXCLAIMING)
- (SPITTING)
- (KEITH SCREAMING)
- You've got wings.
- Hell, yeah!
I see it now.
All this time, you've been
like me gardening angel.
Guardian angel.
- Wow!
- Keith, I fixed you to fix me.
You helped me get my wings
by seeing the error of your ways.
And I helped you experience
a life that you thought you wanted.
But sometimes what you want
isn't always what you really need.
I know what I need.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get our groove on, motherfucker.
(SCREAMING)
Put me down, you're gonna kill me!
Stop crying like a little pussy.
I think I've got
a brown onion in me pants.
There she is.
The United States of Leeds.
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
That's it. Your time's up.
And it looks like a no-show from Lemon.
He can't like you that much, can he, eh'?
Livin' la vida loca down at London,
with Kelly Brook.
- Do you know what I think'?
- No.
I think you're jealous of him.
I think you wish you were in London
with Kelly Brook,
not stuck here in this shithole
with your broken-nosed boyfriend.
You haven't even got a wide-screen telly.
But do you know what'? Keith has.
And his is much bigger than yours.
And I'm not just
talking about his telly.
(MUMBLING) She has a point, you know.
I thought you said
you liked my tiny cock.
(MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY)
You said it fit inside you
as snug as a bug in a rug.
You know, some...
Dennis, what's going on with your mouth'?
I don't know.
Sometimes I just don't know
where I stand with you, Dennis, I don't.
It's a hug and a slap,
and it's a hug and a slap.
You'll get a slap when Keith gets back.
That rhymes.
Lower her into the vat,
you wonky-mouth twat.
There's another rhyme for you there.
That's enough!
- (YELLING)
- Dougie!
(INHALES SHARPLY) That's gotta hurt.
Down there.
Evil Steve's warehouse venue thing.
Ready, man'?
I'm ready.
- Good luck.
- Shit!
- Peace, bruv.
- Shit!
- Keith?
- Rosie.
Where have you been'?
I don't know where I've been.
I was so far up me arse
chasing me dream,
I couldn't see for shit.
But I want you to know
all the stupid things that I did...
Abandoning you and having sex
through clothes with a famous floozy,
it doesn't actually reflect
on how I feel about you.
Are you gonna get me down now?
You're the second best thing
that's ever happened to me.
Second'? What's the first?
- Kelly Brook, obviously. I'm joking.
- Right, get me down so I can hit you.
But I'm not joking when I say...
I say that I love you.
And I love you more than I love myself.
And I love myself a lot.
But I love you even morerer..rer.
What I'm saying is, um...
Will you marry me'?
Why would I wanna marry an arrogant,
self-obsessed know-it-all
who actually don't know anything'?
(EXHALES)
Because you said that I make you smile.
Well, I'm not smiling now, am I'?
What, not even if I do my honk voice'?
(HONKING)
My boobs. (HONKING)
- (HONKING)
- (GIGGLES)
You're smiling. Is that a yes'?
(SOBBING) Yes.
Yarussky!
- Can you do me a favour'?
- Anything.
Get her down, you fucking idiot.
(LAUGHING) Come on, then.
(CHUCKLING)
Heaven, here I come.
- KEITH: Let's go sort this wedding out.
- (DOUGIE GROANING)
Douglas, I'm sorry
for calling you a wronghead.
- That's all right.
- Also,
I'm demoting you as the main man.
- Fair do's.
- You're now the best man.
- Yes! Thank you, Jesus!
- (ROSIE CHUCKLING)
Oh, Keith, I'll get
a speech off internet.
I'll be ever so... Oh!
Ow! Oh, Dougie.
Later on, we'll be talking about
the devastating effects
of the Lemon Phone,
the Keith Lemon Phone.
So if you or anyone else you know
has been affected by its effects,
then we'll be talking about the effects
if it has affected you.
But first, just a few weeks ago,
we met a lady with two vaginae.
Today, as pan' of our sex week,
we meet a man
with a penis and one vagina.
Weird Paul, thank you
very much indeed for coming in.
KEITH: And as the credits roll,
thus ends me
2D cinematic moralistic journey.
I'd like to tell you that
I turned the Securipoles
into water pumps for the thirsty kids
of the Fourth World.
Or that I found me real dad
and he taught me the genuine meaning
of rasclaats and bumbasquat and ting.
Or even that I
continued to dry-hump Kelly Brook
until I broke her tuppence
into a thousand pieces.
But the simple truth is,
well, I settled down with Rosie
and we had three kids.
Eminem, Britney and One Direction.
Archimedes could well have been
a pigmentation of me imagination.
But you know what?
His scripted dialogue
learned me an important lesson.
The grass may be greener
on the other side,
but I'm happy with me crazy paving.
And in answer to the question
that people always ask me,
yes, that is the size of me real penis.
As thick as a Coke can.
If I don't see you through t'week,
I'll see you through t'window.
(LAUGHING)
Hey, I'll tell you what,
let's have some bloopers
like in Cannonball Run.
I thought that was fucking ace
when they did that in that film.
I'm strawberry blond.
I'm strawberry blond, aren't I'?
(CHUCKLING) Leigh, stop fucking laughing.
Sorry...
- Sorry. Yeah, I know.
- This is it now.
MAN: There's something on Paddy's chin
just there, a little bit shiny.
WOMAN: I think it's my lipstick.
- MAN: All right.
- Oh, dear.
Wonder how it got there'? (LAUGHING)
That's a little bit awkward.
WOMAN: Really?
MAN: Stand by.
And the cavalier attitude,
I was sound as a sound.
Sound as a sound.
(LAUGHING)
Sound as a pound.
What the fuck
is this piece of shit, bruv?
Well, that were me phone
and it looks like you broke it.
And that were Billy Ocean
and I think it were sang very well.

How sexy is that'?
MAN: Look up! Debris.
That's the second time
you've fucked it in the arse.
What do you want'?
VERNE TROYER: Fuck.
- You wanna fuck'?
- TROYER: No.
What's the line'?
(CHUCKLING)
Rewind selector!
- That was the cue.
- (LAUGHING)
That means press...
That's street talk for
"press the button."
(ALL LAUGHING)
- Simon Pegg?
- No, Ronan Keating.
- Oh, right, yeah, from Take That.
- No, that's Gary Barlow.
No, Simon Pegg.
Though I was thinking, "Gary Barlow."
- You fucked that up.
- No, you did.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(KEITH LAUGHING)
KEITH: Oh, that was funny.
I fucking love bloopers!
