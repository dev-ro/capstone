Soul of the age
The applause, delight
The wonder of our stage
Our Shakespeare, rise!
Our Shakespeare.
For he is all of ours, is he not?
The most performed playwright
of all time.
The author of 37 plays,
a hundred and fifty-four sonnets,
and several narrative poems
that are collectively known
as the ultimate expressions
of humanity in the English language.
[♪♪♪]
And yet...
And yet,
not a single manuscript of any kind
has ever been found
written in Shakespeare's own hand.
In 400 years, not one document.
He was born the son of a glove maker,
and at some unknown time, armed
[THUNDER CRASHING OVER SPEAKERS]
but with a grammar-school
education,
he went to London,
where, the story goes,
he became an actor,
and, eventually, a playwright.
He died at the age of 52.
And he was survived by
his wife and two daughters,
who, like Shakespeare's own father,
were irrefutably illiterate.
His will famously left his
second-best bed to his widow.
But it made no mention
of a single book
or manuscript.
Our Shakespeare
is a cipher. A ghost.
So let me offer you a different story.
A darker story, of quills and swords.
Of power and betrayal.
Of a stage conquered
and a throne lost.

You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright.
Son of William Jonson, glassblower.
JONSON:
Yeah.
INTERROGATOR: And have you ever
been arrested before, Mr. Jonson?
I'm a writer, aren't I? Of course
I've bloody well been arrested.

That's because no one saw

Ale!

unrequited loves in the box?
The Earl of Southampton?
But with whom?
NASHE: By the beard, that's Edward

Had his own acting troupe
for private court performances.
I wonder if he needs any material.
Certainly not yours.
What, the noble, there? Ha-ha.
Why, he's a gull! He's a fool! Aah!

Why don't you disperse
William Cecil's arse?
Arrest that man!
Disperse!
This play is seditious
and will not continue!
Seditious?
It's a comedy!
There's nothing seditious about it!
Is that right?
And you know this because...?
Because I wrote the bloody thing.
Arrest this man as well!
What? No, wait...
Please! I'm a poet, for God's sake!
I'm not a criminal!
Thus endeth the brief career
of one Ben Jonson.

Well, off to Essex House, then.

I'd like to see his arse dispersed!
POLE:

[GRUNTING]
Out. Henry, how many people
were at that play?
I'm not sure.
Two thousand? Maybe more.
How many performances
are there of a play like that?
Five or six, I suppose.
New service.
By the beard.
Ten thousand souls, all listening
to the writings, the ideas of one man.
That's power, Essex.
And if there's one thing the
Cecils understand, it's power.
New service!
And since when did words
ever win a kingdom?
I'll keep my sword,
thank you very much.
Out.
Henry, some of my men have
intercepted some of William Cecil's
correspondence
with King James of Scotland.
Cecil's all but promising him
the throne.
To James?
Elizabeth would never...
Elizabeth is old. III.
And yet she refuses to name an heir.
SOUTHAMPTON: But a Scotsman?
On the Tudor throne?
ESSEX: That is why we must do
everything in our power to ensure
the right man succeeds Elizabeth.
A man deserving of the Tudor crown.
[♪♪♪]
I ask you for the support
of you and your men, Henry,
if it comes to a fight,
for me to seize the throne.
You know you need not ask.
I stand with you, as I always have.
OXFORD:
Be careful, Henry.
Always concerned for me.
What would you have me do?
Deny him.
The son of the queen?
That is rumor alone, Henry.
Rumor?
All you have to do is look at Essex
to see the queen's reflection.
Everyone thinks he's her son.
My lords.
And I, for one,
would rather bow to a Tudor, bastard
though he may be, than a Scotsman.
My only desire is to see
the next king be the rightful king.
But what Essex contemplates
will lead to civil war. No.
If this is to be done,
it must be done carefully.

whoredom, thievery,
fornication and heresy.
Tell your master that Her Majesty...
Will gladly accept.
That is, of course,

I did indeed, Your Majesty.

Compose something.

Yes, now.
On what subject, Your Grace?
On truth.
For truth,

My Lord of Oxford,
it seems you have added a poet
to your family's line of warriors.
I am as accomplished with sword
and musket as I am in verse.
Are you indeed?
It is my only desire to be Your
Majesty's most trusted servant
in matters both of war and state,

Why, Lord Cecil, we may very well
have found your replacement.
We hope not too soon, Your Majesty.
And what thought you

You have been released.
Got powerful friends now, don't you?

MAN:
Ship oars!
Ahem. My lord.
The Tudor rose.
The most beautiful of flowers,
do you not think?
I assume I owe my freedom to you.
That is true.
And it was hard to come by.
One does not cross
my father-in-law lightly.
Lord William Cecil.
I have the questionable distinction
to be married to his only daughter.
It was helpful
when I wrote to your jailers
to release you
in my father-in-law's name.
My release was not
officially sanctioned?
Don't be an idiot. Of course it wasn't.
But you are free, are you not?
I enjoyed your little comedy, Jonson.
You have great potential.
Thank you, my lord.
But its politics did have
quite an effect on the Tower.
My father-in-law's men
felt it quite seditious.
Politics. My play has nothing
to do with politics.
It's just a simple comedy.
That showed your betters as fools
who would barely get food
from plate to mouth without
the cleverness of their servants.
All art is political, Jonson.
Otherwise, it would just be decoration.
And all artists have something to say.
Otherwise, they'd make shoes.
And you are not a cobbler,
are you, Jonson?
Francesco?
A play, my lord.
One you shall stage Bankside.
JONSON:
Stage?
Under your name.
My name, my lord?
I can't very well use my name, can I?
I'm the 17th Earl of Oxford.
The Lord Great Chamberlain
of England, Viscount Bolebec,
Lord of Escales, Sanford
and Badlesmere, etc. No.
I have a reputation to protect.
In my world, one does not
write plays, Jonson.
People like you do.
Yes, my lord.
My lord, you wrote an entire play.
I know how difficult that is.
Not a play, Jonson.
I've written many.
No doubt many more than you yourself.
A good number performed years ago,
others never seen by a living soul.
And you want me
to put my name to this play?
No, I mean you to put
your name to all of them.
All of them?
Don't look at me
like I just gutted your pet dog.
I mean to make you the most popular,
and therefore most monetarily
successful playwright in London.
I wish you Godspeed and good morrow.
My lord, I really...
This is for your trouble,
Signor Jonson.
And for your silence.
If you break that silence, mm,
not so good for Signor Jonson.
WILLIAM:
Tell me about this play.
It was an anonymous gift.
Essex insisted it be performed
just to spite me in front of court.
Of course he did.
What was it about?
Some nonsense about fairies
and cherubs.
And dancing asses.
Edward, our poet earl,
has returned to court.
Father,
it was just a play.
Know how long it took to
banish them from her presence?
She adores them!
And Edward knows it!
Mark my words,
he has done this to spite us.
[♪♪♪]
Edward wishes to choose the next king.
Haven't you convinced
the Privy Council
to crown James of Scotland
the next king?
Nobody has a better claim.
Except one of Elizabeth's bastards.
You mean Essex.
He despises us.
We shall lose all of our royal
licenses, our property!
I shall convince her
to send Essex to lreland
to quell the Catholic rebellion.
Southampton will follow.
And if God is watching, neither will return alive.
And if he is not...
[HORSES NEIGHING]
WILLIAM:
Robert!
Robert, come here!
I am sorry, my Lord of Oxford.
My son prefers the company of himself.
May I present to you my wife,
Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne?
I am sorry for your loss, my lord.
The realm lost a great man
with your father's death.
We hope you will be happy
in our house.
Are you going to live here forever?
No. Only until
I reach my maturity.
Why?
Because the queen has bade it so.
My lord, when we first met,
you said you wished to
become a great man of state.
The queen and I hope to make that so.
To that end, I have the honor
of introducing you to your tutors.
From 7 to 8, you will be tutored
in French by Mr. Crane.
CRANE:

RICHARDS: My lord.
Two to 3 is geography and history.
And 4 to 5, fencing.
And, uh, composition?
Poetry?
This is a Puritan home, my lord.
We believe such activities
to be the worship of false idols,
and therefore a sin
before the eyes of God.
A sin?
Surely there must be room for

Not in this household.

Well, is he powerful, rich?
Ooh. Then you have to
do it then, don't you?
JONSON: Will, I came to London
to be a great and soaring poet.
To be the conscience of our times.
The soul of the age.
To ch-change the world, not...
Ch-change the world?
What, with rhyme?
Yes. Why not? Why can't a man
change the world with words?

popular playwright in London."

thank you very much.

This week, writing. Next, hawking.
No. No, I won't do it. It would be

You think my name can be bought?
No, no, no, not at all. No.

WILLIAM: King Philip of Spain sees the
current Catholic revolt in lreland
as a weakness of ours.
A weakness to be exploited.
ELIZABETH:
Ireland?
There are reports of his sending

We must act quickly. We must replace
the Lord Lieutenant of lreland,
and send additional troops...
Replace?
With whom?
I would recommend
his lordship,
the Earl of Essex.
No, that's impossible.
He cannot be spared.
We value his counsel greatly.
WILLIAM:
Essex's martial abilities are,
in my opinion, the only antidote
to the plague of Spain.
Essex could not, unfortunately,
remain in the Privy Council
while he is in lreland.
And who would you advise
to replace him?
Sir Robert Cecil.
ELIZABETH:
Your son?
Yes.
Though he is my own advisor first,
Your Majesty, my son second.
Yes. Yes, yes.
Ah. Very well. Send Essex
to lreland.
And we will place Robert
on our Privy Council.
I saw a play this last weekend,

It made me think of...
many things long past.
I'd like to see more of them.
Has Edward been happy,
William...
with your daughter?
WILLIAM:
Murdered?!
By your own hand.
He was stealing my poems.
He was doing my bidding!
Yours?
Of course! As soon as Robert told me
you were ignoring my express orders...
Robert? Robert told?
Enough!
Thou shalt not worship false idols
in my household.
Your everlasting soul
hangs in the balance, not poems.
My poems are my soul.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
You have placed me
in a grave position, Edward.
I cannot have my reputation soiled
by this regrettable lack
of control on your part.
We can claim self-defense.
He drew sword first.
But there is something
I wish in return.
My daughter is young
and impressionable.
She has feelings for you, Edward.
It is to be expected,
living in such close quarters.
Sir, for the last three years, you
have seized much of my inheritance.
Hold your tongue, lest you make
a claim you cannot retract.
I was legally reimbursed for your
education and living expenses.
You suggest you be reimbursed the rest of
my estate through your daughter's bed.
No.
This is how I suggest
we keep your noble head
from the executioner's block.

the designs of a murderer,
the pleas of his victims.
Only when I put their words,

Only then is my mind quieted.

I'll have little trouble
parting the legs of barmaids.
You cannot play Romeo.
What? Why not?
I'm perfect for the role.
I will not let that oaf Spencer
have another go at one of my roles.
Only Will Shakespeare can pump
the life into Romeo's veins.
And his codpiece.
No, Ben.
Ben, I'm an actor.
Every inch of me,
right down to my very toes.
I want to...
No, I crave to act.
So bloody well act like a writer.
And, for God's sake,
keep off the stage.
Writers do not have time to act.

SPENCER [AS ROMEO]: What lady's that, which

I know not, sir.
O, she doth teach the torches
to burn bright.
It seems she hangs upon
the cheek of night,
like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear.
[GROANS]
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,
as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done,
I'll watch her place of stand,
and, touching hers,
make blessed my rude hand.
Hmph.
Did my heart love till now?
Forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty

We very much liked your play tonight.
Your young King Henry
reminded us of you.
Did he?
ELIZABETH:
Brash, yet brave.
A boy and yet a man.
Fair on the eyes.
Fairer to the ear.
We are glad of your return
from the continent.
Two years is too long without
such excellent amusements.
Had I known my absence would have
caused Your Grace so much longing,
I would have returned
much, much sooner.
Your wife must be pleased to have
you once more present at her side.
It is but a small comfort to me.
I am returned only under
my father-in-law's insistence.
Cecil told me your match
was one of love.
So he would wish.
But how could one love the moon
after having seen the sun?
[ELIZABETH LAUGHS]
ELIZABETH: Which country did you like
the best on your travels, my lord?
Italy, Your Grace.
Hmm. Italy. And why is that?
The weather? Or the food?
No, no. Their theater,
which they call la commedia dell'arte.
And, of course,
the women.
The women?
They were more, uh, clear...
with their desires. When they
want something, they take it.
They do not wait to be taken.

Are you Prince Hal?

You're Puck.
Puck?
Yes, Puck.

Puck would never fight for you
in the Netherlands.
The Netherlands?
Well, why not?
It's an open secret you support
the rebels against Spain.
You are commissioning Englishmen
to help fight their cause.
Spain's loss is England's gain.
Is this why you bedded me?
For a commission?
No, no, it's just...
Leave me.
How dare you? How dare you?
I command you to leave my presence!
O mistress mine,
where are you roaming?
O, stay,

your true love's coming.
That can kiss,

No further, pretty sweeting.
Journeys end in lovers' meeting,

What is love?
'Tis not hereafter.
Present mirth hath present laughter.
What's to come is still unsure:
In delay there lies no plenty.
Then come,

Youth's a stuff will not endure.
[MOANS]
You will stay in England,
and in my chambers.
NASHE:
I could do it if I wanted to.
MARLOWE:
Do what?
A play in bic... In bia...
In iambic pentameter.
It's not that hard.
Think so?
Have you ever tried?
Of course not.
But I could if I wanted.
Well, it wasn't all in verse.
Ah. You see?
Even easier.
Henslowe wants Romeo

To be, or not to be,
that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

and by opposing end them.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
To die: to sleep, no more,
and by a sleep to say we end
the heart-ache,
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to.
'Tis a consummation,
devoutly to be wished.
To die, to sleep,
to sleep: perchance to dream:
Ay, there's the rub.
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come,
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil, must give us pause.
There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[SOBS]
[GASPING]
Ah!
MAN 1 : Give it good heat.
MAN 2: This hot enough?
[BELL TOLLING]
You're certain of this?
William Cecil was murdered.
Not literally, of course.
He was a character.
Fictional character.
But the metaphor was clear
for anyone to see. And see, they did.
Will you shut it down?
Your service to his lordship
is once again greatly appreciated.
He butchered you! Not only in front
of court but the entire city as well!
We must arrest this Shakespeare and...
No, Robert.
If he really is as popular as you say,
we would only anger the mob.
We cannot maintain authority
if we are laughingstocks!
Our authority comes
from Elizabeth and from God.
You must think more deeply, Robert.
You must compensate
for your malformations.
You must compensate with
the gifts God did give you.
With cunning. With ruthlessness.
[♪♪♪]
It's from
King James of Scotland.
James is aware of the queen's
affections for Essex
and of the rumors of his birth,
and he is justly concerned.
You will write to James.
You will tell him that I am gravely ill,
but that all is in hand.
[PANTING]
And then tell him,
Essex will not return
from lreland alive.
God does indeed require
our help in this matter.
This is how kings are made, my son.
So it was with Elizabeth,
so it shall ever be.
James will expect you to do the same
for him and he will reward you for it.
[GRUNTS]
But we must
do one thing more.
Like Essex,
Edward must be removed.
Edward?
You must bribe someone.
His fencing master, perhaps.
Promise him a fortune if he kills him.
I am with child.
Are you certain?
Two cycles have passed, my lord.
And I wish to marry him.
Marry him?
Your Grace, he is already married.
I can do what I want.
Can you?
Most of the Catholic princes
of Europe seek to topple you
and end your Protestant reign.
All that stop them are the Channel
and the hope they marry you
and end your realm by other means.
I love him!
[GROANS]
Would you risk your throne
for him? Hm?
Would you risk England for him?
[YELLS]
We must do as we have done before.
You must go on progress,
somewhere isolated, accompanied
by only those whom you most trust.
After the birth, I shall find a suitable
house for the child to be reared in.
And Edward?
He must never know.
[♪♪♪]
What have you done?
I am praying.
She will not see me!
I've gone to her, she will not
receive me, and now she's gone!
She is on progress.
Where?
Where did she go?
What did you say to her?
She does not ask my advice
on matters of the heart.
If she did, she would not
have chosen you.
You must've known
she would go elsewhere.
You're neither the first
nor the last of her lovers!
Go back to my daughter, Edward.
[♪♪♪]
She will accept you with open arms.
Behave as your great title
demands you behave.
Tend to your estates,
your investments.
And make me a grandson.
An heir.
It's difficult to write, is it not?
After something like Hamlet?
It eats at you.
At your soul.
Why do you think Will
hasn't been arrested?
He murders a caricature
of old William Cecil himself,
and still whores it all the way
to Westminster and back.
Ahem. Perhaps they haven't noticed.
I made sure they did.
You informed on one of your own?
To the Tower?
Watch who you judge, Ben.
We do what we have to to survive
and survive well in this life. All of us.
And Will is definitely not one of us.
You know he's illiterate, don't you?
Oh, he can read well enough.
How else could he learn his lines?
But the man never actually
learned to form his letters.
So who did write Hamlet?
A nobleman.
Yes, but which?
You know, don't you, Ben?
Careful, Kit.
You sound like one of your plays.
MARLOWE: Ben! Tell me.
We can go to him together.
Guarantee his anonymity.
For a price.
You reported on me as well,
didn't you, Kit?
Last year. For Every Man.
That's why I was arrested.
Wasn't it?
I had nothing to do with that.
Ben. I'll just go to Will.
And he'll tell me because he has
so much more to lose than you.
[GRUNTS]
And you'll profit nothing from it.
Nothing.

We cannot attack such a force.

Eight shillings on the bear.

I won't be your beggar.
Oh, no. This isn't a request, Ben.
I'll have more money.
Or what? You'll slit my throat,

I know he went to you last night

Here are the conditions

One, you will not

Two, you will never see

Three, you will avoid court
at all costs.
Her Majesty would prefer
never to be reminded of you,
in any way ever again.
Banished.
No, you have the freedom
of the kingdom, just not of the court.
Those are her terms.
Here are mine.
Go back to my daughter.
Make some effort to make her happy.
Finally act according
to your station in life
and accept the responsibilities
of your great title.
My lord?
I, too, have a condition.
I will go back to your daughter,
if you tell me the name of the child.
[LAUGHS]
I do not think the whore
has named the bastard.
No.
The other one.

I will go back to your daughter.
I will give you as many grandchildren
as she can bear, or I can remain here.
There is no record of the true birth
nor any trail that leads back to you
or the queen. The foster parents
never knew the truth
and both now are dead.
The name.
Make even a hint of this

CONDELL: Now are our brows

our bruised arms hung up

Grim-visaged war hath

But I, that am not shaped

I, that am rudely stamped,

I, that am curtailed
of this fair proportion,
cheated of feature
by dissembling nature,
deformed, unfinish'd,
sent before my time
into this breathing world,
scarce half made up,
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me...

SOUTHAMPTON: Nothing rash.
No man is to draw sword or fire musket
without direct order.
Yes, my lord.
And the mob?
When does it arrive?
By the stroke of 4.
The streets are quiet.
SOUTHAMPTON:
They are all at the theater.
Edward promised us a mob,
and a mob we will have.
I am determined to prove a villain...
A pox on you!
A pox on Cecil!
Why is Oxford's man

Where?
There.
CONDELL [AS GLOUCESTER]:... And hate

She will not forgive him this, Edward.
Essex will be convicted,
and executed
for treason.
[THUNDER CRASHING]
As will your son.
What?
Didn't you think I knew?
My father told me all his secrets.
All of them.
Though the most fascinating
was not made known to me
until after his death.
He hated you, Edward.
But still, he married
his only daughter to you.
He wanted his grandson to be an earl.
No, Edward.
He wanted his grandson to be
a king.
Elizabeth had several
bastard children, Edward.
Not just Essex and Southampton.
She was 16 for the first.
Bloody Mary was still queen and
our future Gloriana was out of favor.
No one thought her very important
at all, except my father, of course.
And when her first child was born...
a male,
my father took it and hid it.
The grandson of Henry VIII.
The foundling, of course,
had to be reared a nobleman.
John de Vere,
the previous Earl of Oxford,
agreed to accept the task.
You lie!
Do I?
Why did he work so hard to become
your guardian after your father died?
He had it all planned.
Years in advance.
He would teach you everything
he knew about statecraft,
marry you to his daughter, and after
Elizabeth's death, proclaim you...
heir.
His own grandchild
to follow you on the throne.
But he could not possibly predict what
kind of failure you would become!
How you would fail in politics!
Ignore your estates
to the point of bankruptcy.
All to write...
poetry.
Nor could he have predicted
that you would commit incest.
[SOFTLY] Oh.
Delicious, isn't it?
Right out of a Greek...
tragedy.
Elizabeth...
would never have...
What?
Slept with her son?
I don't think she ever knew,
to tell you the truth.
Though you never know with the Tudors.
They all have had such strange
tastes in bedfellows.
[CHUCKLES]
You could have been a king, Edward.
And your son after you.
Except for the fact...
that you...
were you.
[♪♪♪]
[GUNSHOTS]
Sentence has been passed.
They are to be beheaded.

COURT OFFICIAL:
Robert Devereaux,
Earl of Essex, is hereby executed
for treason by Her Gracious Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth
on the 25th day of February
in the year of our Lord,
1601.
Strike true.
God save the queen!
[GASPING]
Leave us.
All of you.
Sir Robert,
you as well.
[DOOR CLOSES]
You look old.
I thank Your Majesty for seeing me.
You cannot have him.
He is our son.
He is a traitor, like Essex.
They only wished for a voice
equal to their birth.
You caused this.
Your play, your words.
I know what you've done.
Your head should be cut off, not his.
Then take it,
in our son's stead.
Neither they nor I
conspired against you.
Cecil alone was our aim.
The King of Spain, Mary,
four French kings, eight popes,
they all wanted me dead,
but here I am,
because of the Cecils, my commoners.
We would have protected you.
You? My loyal earls? Hm.
I could only ever trust the Cecils
because their wealth, their power,
their survival, all depended on me.
Me.
Let...
our son live.
Does...?
Does he know?
And if I give him to you...?
[♪♪♪]
He will never learn of it from me.
But, Edward?
None of your poems,
or your plays
will ever carry your name.
None.

Master Jonson?
His lordship is asking for you.
Excuse me, my lady.
[♪♪♪]
Thank you, doctor.
Jonson.
Come closer.
Did you know my family can trace
its peerage back further than
any other family in the kingdom?
We fought at Crecy,
at Bosworth Field, at Agincourt.
When I inherited my earldom,
I was one of the richest men
ever to breathe English air.
And at last breath,
I shall be one of the poorest.
Never a voice in government.
Never a sword raised
in glorious battle.
Words.
Merely words shall be my sole legacy.
You alone watch my plays
and know them as mine.
When I hear the applause,
the cheering of the audience,
the hands clapping,
I know they are celebrating
another man.
But in that
cacophony of sounds,
I strained to hear two hands only.
Yours.
But hear them, I never did.
You have never told me...
Never...
told me what you thought of my work.
I find
your words
the most
wondrous
heard on our stage.
On any stage.
Ever.
You
are the soul of the age.
[JONSON CRYING SOFTLY]
[JONSON CLEARS THROAT]
[SIGHS]
Promise me, Jonson.
Promise you'll keep our secret safe,
that you won't expose Shakespeare.
My lord...
I've seen it in your face.
He vexes you.
How could he not?
But he is not your burden.
He is mine.
All my writings...
my plays, my sonnets...
keep them safe.
Keep them from my family.
The Cecils.
Wait a few years
and then publish them.
My lord, I...
I am not worthy of this charge.
I betrayed you.
I told them of your...
I have made it my life's work to know
the character of men, Jonson.
I know you.
You may have betrayed me...
but you will never betray my words.
[♪♪♪]
What are those?
These are my...
My lady, your husband was...
Get out.
You, your friends,
your blasphemous theater
have brought ruin
and dishonor to this family.
Ruin?
Dishonor?
My lady,
you, your family, even I,
even Queen Elizabeth herself,
will be remembered solely
because we had the honor to live
whilst your husband put ink to paper.

OXFORD:
"To the Earl of Southampton:
The love I dedicate

whereof this pamphlet,
without a superfluous moiety.
What I have done is yours,
what I have to do is yours.
Being part in all I have,
devoted yours."
[GASPING]
I can make
all this
go away, Jonson.
Or I can bring you so much
pain.
Pain.
I know you have them.
All his manuscripts.
My sister saw you leave Oxford
Stone with them under your arm.
They were destroyed.
Burned.
Burned?
By your men.
Every word went up in flames
when you torched the theater.
He's lying.
My lord,
why would I lie?
He was something
I could never be.
An undeniable perfection
that plagued my soul.
And to him,
I was nothing.
A messenger.
He tells the truth.
Let him go.
INTERROGATOR:
Guard!
Release him.
ROBERT: And, Jonson?
Better him, won't you?
Wipe his memory for all time.
I'm afraid that is not possible,
my lord.

CONDELL [AS CHORUS]:
O for a Muse of fire
that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention.
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.
We had seen some
of this Shakespeare's plays
in Edinburgh, Sir Robert.
I must tell you,
we enjoyed them immensely
and look forward to seeing many
more, now that we're in London.
I assume you're as avid
a theater man as myself.
Of course, Your Majesty.
CONDELL:... That have dared
on this unworthy scaffold
to bring forth so great an object.
PROLOGUE: Robert Cecil
remained the most powerful man
in the court of King James,
though he couldn't prevent
the public theaters
from becoming ever more popular.
William Shakespeare, however,
spent the remainder of his days,
not in the playhouses of London,
but in the small town of his birth,
Stratford-upon-Avon,
as a businessman and grain merchant.
Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire
to be the most celebrated
playwright of his time,
becoming England's
first poet laureate.
And in 1623, he wrote the dedication
to the collected works
of the man we call
William Shakespeare.
And so,
though our story is finished,
our poet's is not.
For his monument is ever-living,
made not of stone, but of verse.
And it shall be remembered
as long as words are made of breath
and breath of life.
