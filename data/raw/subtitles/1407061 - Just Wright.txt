It was ... is great.
It was nice, but nice
a gentleman.
The truth was very sweet.

You're crazy.
I do not like the athletes,
I like normal men.
My God, I have to think
I'm going to get!
You're the best Leslie.
There.
I've finished.
"Yes.
Do not you say you're fabulous?
But you need more red.
I do not need more powder.
This evening you will find a husband.
"I look good.

Do not worry.
I'm very excited.
"Goodbye.
"Goodbye.
I propose a toast
for the birthday boy.
I know they heard on other occasions

The issue is that most of the time
that is true.
And then we have this man,

He is a gentleman in

Did you see my performance?
Yes, volunteers at a shelter?
I gave him something different.
Yes, the life of the girl next door.
He is special
I can feel it.
You took the number

I am the first to do that
since joining the NBA.
Trust me, he will find me.
What?!
If you need to fix the windows,

Go Daddy, you were right.
That makes a big difference.
So small.
How was the party?
I knew it.
He saw you and pam ...
After Morgan saw
and forgot that I was there.
I am accustomed.
Why not?
She is beautiful.
Are you real.
Dad, that's what I think
good men of friends.
It will happen, just give it time.
Dad, I have 35 years of age,
When will I find
a wonderful man
who thinks that they can not live without me?
He is somewhere.
When you meet him,
I'll be at work.
And make sure you have
all teeth.
Sure.
Dad.
You only need a screw.
Only a settlement.
If you live here
I thought that I was wrong.
How do you know I live here?

He changed me Leslie.
I know it's hard to believe
he made me a better person.
You talking to me Mor
I know you.
Look, I admit.
I started with him for other reasons,
but he got me into the heart.
Are you serious?
Let me show you the rest of the house.
This is where you've been living.
What is that?
I have no idea.
Is your personal space or something.
I do not know why, it is strange but
you always have to worry about
a secret room.
Yes, I have heard of those rooms.
Attend all.
Go down the music.
First, thank you all for coming,
to be held to represent the East

I have a lot to be grateful.
