What?
What?
What is it?
A message.
Yes
It's a young face
He's waving
Peaceful.
Very peaceful.
(Fizzing)
Oh, no, no, no. Sh.
Hush.
No, my darling.
It's all right, my precious. No.
No more.
No more.
Naughty.
Raining like that. Very naughty.
Turn on the light, Billy.
Put the thing up
We shall have to test it from the outside tonight.
Of course...it's not what it used to be.
It's not his room any longer.
But Arthur understands
We're doing it with his blessing.
That's just how he put it.
He said, "You have my blessing".
Comfy little bed, this.
I remember when I slept in it.
Very comfy.
You never slept in that bed.
Yes, I did, dear.
That time you were ill. Remember?
No, I don't remember.
No, well, it's not important, dear.
What you say, Billy,
what anybody says, is important.
This was always Arthur's bed.
Till he went to school.
I've never allowed anybody
to sleep in it.
Yes, of course, dear.
Well, she'll be...nice and
comfy in this.
What, um...
What does it look like?
Very neat.
No, no. I mean, what does it all look like,
the overall effect?
If you'd never seen it before
and you suddenly woke up in that bed...
..where would you think you were?
In a hospital.
Mm, yes.
Exactly. In a hospital.
Aren't we clever ones, huh?
It's going to work, Billy.
The plan's going to work.
Yes?
Perfect. Did you put the extra-strong bulb in it?
- Yes.
- The 150 watt?
Well, you saw me put it in.
Good. It’s fine, then.
I couldn't see anything.
Look at the dust in this place.
Have you seen the dust?
I thought old Mother Jackson was supposed to
have done this out before she went on holiday.
* MENDELSSOHN: Hear My Prayer
Well, we can live with it.
I can't live with it. I hate dust.
Hmm. It’s lovely for her. She's gone
abroad this year and I said
"Where are you going for your holidays
this year, Mrs Jackson?"
I felt sorry for her. I thought she'd be stuck
at Margate, getting her usual third-degree burn.
Not a bit of it
"We're going to France", she said,
"in my Cyril's new car".
You can imagine that, can't you? Five of them
crammed in the Mini with her Cyril at the wheel.
A nightmare.
Still, it suits our purposes.
The further away the better, till it's all over.
You want that on, do you?
Yes.
It helps me to concentrate.
Of course, it'd be a marvellous opportunity
not to have her back.
We're not giving up a treasure or anything.
She only does it for the gossip,
and we can do without that.
According to the directions,
it takes a couple of hours.
So we might as well make a start.
You think...we ought to start now, do you?
Yes. That's what I just said.
Put the scissors down, will you?
You can finish that later.
Well, we're not having
any last-minute doubts, are we, Billy?
You know it's too late for that.
We have to go through with it,
exactly as planned.
Now's the only time
with Mrs Jackson safely away.
Yes, I know.
You want that car, don't you, Billy?
You know, the one you saw.
You want things to be different,
not only for me, but for all of us.
I'm not doing it for the car.
The car...
..isn't why I’m doing it.
Listen, Billy.
Listen, will you?
Carefully.
You know that I can never tell
when you're really listening to me.
And try to understand, Billy, what I am.
What I am can't just be thrown away, can it?
And it's not wrong.
What we're going to do is not wrong.
We're doing it for his sake.
Arthur wants me to be recognised for what l am.
- l mean, l can't tell you. He...
(Gramophone off)
He convinced me.
I had to be convinced myself before l told you.
l mean, l know it's different for you.
I’ve known that all along, and l do try to make...
So quiet in here.
Suddenly so terribly quiet.
Did you turn that off?
No, dear. You did it yourself.
I did? I turned it off?
l wanted it on. Why would I turn it off?
Well, then, it must have been me.
Why did I ever marry you, Billy?
I don't know, dear. Why did you?
Because you're weak.
And because you need me.
Well, those are two good reasons.
We've had so much sorrow, Billy.
Too much sorrow.
But it's all going to be changed now.
Everything's going to be different.
You know what I sometimes wish?
I sometimes wish I were ordinary, like you.
Dead ordinary
Ordinary and dead like all the others
Too much sorrow, Billy.
And you can't buy your own happiness at
the expense of somebody else's unhappiness.
Who was it that said that? Do you know?
Yes.
Who?
Arthur said it.
Oh, yes.
Of course.
Fancy you remembering.
He didn't say it to you, did he?
No, dear.
You told me.
Oh yes
It’s funny he's never been close to you.
Not that I blame you.
It’s easier for me.
You don't have my gift.
It all might have been different
if Mummy hadn't left me this house.
She wanted me to have it. They read it out.
The solicitor read it out of the will.
He sat...
..just there.
We've never really quarrelled, have we,
except about this house?
- Have you ever thought of that?
- Yes, I’ve thought about it, dear.
Still, I have made it up to you in other ways,
haven't I?
Yes, lots of ways.
And you do need me, don't you?
Well, say it, then.
I don't have to say it.
I wouldn't be here, would I, if I didn't?
No.
But I do think you had second thoughts just now.
Not that I mind. I mean, I understand.
It’s not easy for you.
But you did have second thoughts,
didn't you, Billy?
Well...not second thoughts as such, no.
- Well, what, then?
- Well...
As you said, I don't have your gift.
Yes. You're right.
I do keep forgetting that.
You see, when they first found out,
when I was little...
You remember, I told you...
about my aunt.
She was the first one. She knew.
She tumbled it.
She used to go on endlessly
to Mummy in this room.
I used to hear them.
(Echoing laughter)
I used to creep to the top of the stairs to listen.
And then at Sunday tea, all the family came...
and I had to perform.
I had to get up and do my party piece.
And in the end,
I began to enjoy it,
to look forward to it.
It was nice being different.
I mean, you didn't get told off,
you just had all the nice things, all the...
You see, it wasn't a trick.
It was there, all those years ago,
here in this room.
And it was real
It was happening to me
I didn't have to make it up.
Don't you see?
That's why. That's why it has to happen, Billy.
Otherwise, what's it all been for?
Just to take a collection
every Wednesday afternoon, rain or fine?
I mean, £8.10 in a biscuit tin?
No.
It has to be more than that, Billy. It has to be.
And Arthur's...
..quite certain, is he?
If you're ready.
Well...
..I mustn't disappoint him...
..must I?
(Motorbike engine sputters to life)
(Distant voices)
(Church bell rings)
(Bell chimes four)
(School bell)
GIRL: Oh wait for me
Excuse me. Are you Mr Clayton's chauffeur?
Yes.
Well, the headmistress, Miss Bray,
she's got a letter for you to give to Mr Clayton.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, no, no, I haven't got it.
She...wants to give it to you in person.
Oh, right.
See you in a tick, Amanda.
(Car horn)
Open the door, there's a good girl.
Come on, be a good girl. Open it up.
(Voices)
I won't hurt you, l promise.
It’s only a game.
I promise, cross my heart. It’s only a game.
(Clatter)
It must be round here somewhere.
I know
Hey! Here.
Thanks, mister.
Play further away next time. You'll hit someone.
All right.
Don't be afraid, dear.
Don't be afraid.
It’s only a game.
(Aeroplane roars overhead)
(Engine starts)
(Water gurgles down plughole)
I think it needs one more good rinse.
- Can you manage?
- Yes, thank you.
I'll just go and have another look at her.
* MENDELSSOHN: O For The Wings Of A Dove
I’ve had another look at her.
She's...still all right.
Well, don't fuss.
The worst thing you can do with children
is to fuss.
It confuses them.
Read this to me, will you?
I want to hear how it sounds.
Here, use this,
in case we want to make corrections.
You...want me to read it out loud, do you?
Yes.
Well, could we have that a little quieter, please?
Oh, Billy, I do wish you weren't such a bore
about good music.
Dear Sir,
- This is to notify you that your dau...
- Oh, er...
That's not a good start. Too formal.
Cross it out. We don't need an introduction.
This is to notify you
that your daughter is in our possession.
She is quite safe and if you follow instructions,
she will remain safe.
(Clears throat) By this time, you will have
informed the police. That was to be expected.
But do not tell them about this letter des...
Oh, full stop after letter.
Do not tell them about this letter. Destroy it.
We are professionals and we mean business.
You will find enclosed
a lock of your daughter's hair as proof.
Wait. Er...change that.
Lock means curl.
Make it a...piece. Her hair's straight.
Or just some.
Piece.
(Softly ) Piece.
I enclose a piece
of your daughter's hair as proof.
Your instructions are as follows, full stop.
1) You will put an advert into the personal
column of tomorrow's Evening Standard
to the effect that you are willing
to oblige and sign it...
..willing to oblige and sign it,
with your Christian name.
That's good.
This advert you will address
to Longfellow. Full stop
2) You will get a blue BOAC overnight bag
and put into it £25,000.
(Clears throat)
You will be informed later by telephone
where and when you are to deliver the money.
After delivery,
your daughter will be returned unharmed.
But if these instructions
are not followed perfectly,
or, if there is any attempt
to detain the man to whom...
That doesn't have an E, does it?
- What?
- Whom
No.
Well, you've got one.
Um...
If there's any attempt to detain the man
to whom you will give the money,
you will never see your daughter alive again.
Signed Longfellow
I suppose we need that last bit, do we?
Yes, we need it.
Even though we don't mean it?
Even though we don't mean it.
They have to believe we mean it.
Yes, I...
I suppose the truth of the matter is,
I haven't...taken it in yet.
What we've done.
Well, what have we done?
We've borrowed a child. That's what we've done.
Of course, they have...another word for it.
We have borrowed a child, Billy.
Borrowed. Borrowed. Just keep saying that.
Get on with your letter.
I’ll be back down shortly.
Very good Billy
It won't be a joke any more, will it?
Once you've posted it.
- It never was a joke, Billy.
- No, but you know what l mean.
Once you post it, no-one else is
going to use the word "borrow".
Oh, Billy.
How many times must I tell you?
What we are doing is a means to an end.
Now, you agree with the end, don't you?
Well, then, you must agree with the means.
You can't have one without the other.
Burn these after I leave.
But we're not going to keep the money
And the child won't be hurt in any way.
No
Except if it goes wrong,
who's going to believe that?
I mean we can't expect anybody
to believe the near reason
The trouble is, Billy, you lack imagination.
You miss all the good things in life,
just because you won't reach that bit further
to touch the truth.
Say you love me.
I love you.
And you...couldn't live without me, could you?
I mean, you tried it once
and you had to come back.
And I took you back, didn't I?
You made me a promise.
Remember?
You promised me.
Yes.
I promised you.
Go on. Post your letter.
And come back safely.
Say, "Come back safely".
And come back safely.
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Take her
before it's too late.
Girl missing.
Where? Oh.
The only daughter of Charles Clayton,
wealthy chairman of Clayton Industries Limited,
was last night stated to be missing from home.
It doesn't say much, does it?
They never do at first.
That doesn't worry me.
I want it to start slowly.
You get her breakfast. I’ll change.
Good morning, Amanda. How are you
feeling this morning? A bit better?
Just going to take your temperature,
and then you can have your breakfast.
Who are you?
Nice scrambled eggs, and we don't
want them to get cold, do we?
Lie back and open your mouth.
I want to know who you are first.
I’m your nurse.
What nurse?
Nurse Johnson. Under the tongue.
There. No talking now.
You're in hospital.
Even been in hospital before?
Well, then, you'll know how to behave.
You didn't take that long enough.
Didn't I?
No. Dr Loxton takes ages
Why am I in hospital?
Why?
Yes. Caroline says you only go
to hospital to die.
- Who is Caroline?
- My best friend.
Well, Caroline is just being silly.
No, she isn't. She's very clever.
She's a Christian Scientist.
Oh, is she?
Here we are.
What have I got?
- German measles.
- Had it.
Oh, no, this is a very special kind.
Double German measles.
Very catching.
- Is it very special?
- Mm, very.
That's why you've got a room to yourself.
I was at school. I wasn't ill.
Yes, you were.
You were sent home from school.
Don't you remember?
Now, eat your breakfast!
Why have you got that on your face?
I have to wear it in case
I catch your measles.
You eat it up.
(Locks door)
(Door opens)
You didn't tell her she'd be going...
You didn't tell her she'd be going home soon.
I think you ought to tell her that.
I thought you were going to tell her
right away.
Well, I forgot.
You know, with children, you have to tell them,
set their little minds at rest right away.
Billy, what do you know about children?
They're really quite adaptable, children.
They're like...like little animals.
You know how animals look
in the pet shop in the window?
When you see them, they...
You take them home and you feed them
and they adapt in a matter of hours.
Billy.
Yes, dear. You're right, I’m sure.
Well, you remember
what Arthur was like at her age.
I mean, they...they're quite
pleased to be sick.
Makes them feel different
and important.
Billy.
I wonder, could you help me?
Er, do you know where
a Mr and Mrs Clayton live?
In what connection is it, madam?
I want to see Mr Clayton.
Do you have an appointment?
No, I don't.
Well, this is the house,
but I don't think Mr Clayton can see you.
It’s not official business, is it?
No.
But I really do think he would see me
if he knew what I'd come about.
What have you come about, then?
Something that vitally concerns him
at this moment.
Well, I'll ask up at the house.
Come with me.
Hey, miss.
I'd like to see Mr Clayton, please.
Bocsánat.
We'll just have to cancel.
That's no problem, surely.
Thank you, Carla.
What is it now?
I’m sorry to trouble you, sir,
but this lady has some information...
This is my card, Mr Clayton.
Who is it, darling?
Look I don't know sweetie. I'm just finding out.
All right, I’ll deal with this.
Perhaps you'd better hang on a moment.
Carla, will you ask Mrs Miles...
Mrs Miles, will you get the constable
a cup of coffee, please?
- Would you like one, darling?
- No.
Would you...come this way, Mrs Savage?
Oh, I’m so sorry.
Darling, this is Mrs Savage. My wife.
No, I’m sorry. That's all l have to say.
- Who was that?
- Nothing, Mr Clayton. Just another newspaper.
Get me some cigarettes, Sheila, will you?
Er, couple of packets, box of 100, anything.
Oh, I’m sorry. Sit down.
Yes, Mrs Savage,
what information do you have?
Well, I’m afraid I don't have
anything definite.
That is, definite to you.
But I read the papers this morning
and I felt I must come.
You see
last night I had a dream.
A dream?
Yes.
Mrs Savage...
I don't want to be rude,
but we've been up all night.
I’m sure you came with good intentions,
but we've had offers of help
from other people like yourself.
We had a man half an hour ago who offered
to find our daughter with a divining rod.
You do see, don't you?
Yes, of course. But there is a difference.
You see, I’m a professional medium.
My dreams are not without significance.
What sort of dream was it?
I saw a little girl sitting alone.
She was lost.
I was quite sure she was lost
Of course that in itself
wouldn't mean much but
the symbolism was very strong.
Symbolism?
Yes. The little girl was surrounded by clay.
Wet clay
And when I read your name in the papers
I coupled it with the clay.
¿And?
- Darling, you don't have any cigarettes, do you?
- Hm? No. No, I haven't.
And er...
And that means something,
does it, Mrs Savage?
Oh, yes.
The connection between the clay
and your name was too strong to ignore.
Was that all?
No. The child in my dream used some names.
Names?
Yes.
She said, er, Caroline first of all.
That's her best friend at school.
Yes, well, she kept saying that.
And then, just before my dream ended,
she said, "Hedge". Could that mean anything?
Yes, Hedgey. That's her toy.
Well, it's a sort of funny old hedgehog,
all falling to pieces.
She won't ever sleep without it.
Well, it...it must be that, mustn't it, darling?
You see, she had it with her when...
Well, she'd taken it to school with her.
It’s something to go on, isn't it?
Nothing else, Mrs Savage?
No, just those three things.
Mrs. Savage,
you...you are a professional medium,
aren't you?
Yes.
Darling, what do you think we ought to do?
Just a moment sweetie
Mrs Savage,
again I don't want to appear rude or ungrateful,
but what you've just told us, you could have
learned by accident or by half a dozen ways.
People gossip. I have a staff. They gossip.
You could have read about it in a magazine.
They're always writing about my wife.
You could have come by this information
in a dozen ways.
Yes, but the point is that I didn't.
I had a dream.
The point is, Mrs Savage, I don't know
why you came to see me and not the police.
If your dream means so much,
and you think it does,
I find it very odd
that you didn't go to the police first.
Now, let me ask you a question, Mrs Savage.
What do you want out of it
- Darling.
- I’m sorry?
Well, what's in it for you?
You must have some angle.
- You think I’m after money?
- Well, it's possible, isn't it?
Eh? People do things for money.
It has been known.
I’m so sorry.
I’m obviously wasting your time.
But I do understand.
Goodbye, Mrs Clayton, and don't worry.
I know your little girl's safe.
You don't know anything of the kind,
so don't give my wife any false hopes.
I’ll tell you something that wasn't in your dream.
I might just as well tell you,
because it will be in the papers.
Our little girl has been kidnapped.
She's being held for ransom.
- I’m so sorry. I didn't realise.
- No, no, exactly. Thank you for coming.
(Phone rings)
Yes? Speaking.
I’m terribly sorry, Mrs Savage.
It’s just that we're both so worried.
I do think the fact that they've got in touch
with us means she's safe, don't you?
They usually do this sort of thing for the money,
don't they, nothing else?
I’m sure she'll be all right, and I do understand
your husband not having time for me.
- No nothing
- But I’m never wrong about these things.
Thank you very much for coming.
Anything helps at the moment.
Sheila, will you show Mrs Savage out?
Thank you.
If I get one more call from you
I'II have the phone disconnected!
(Slams phone down)
What about those bastards, darling?
They want a picture
of you and me in her bedroom.
What with them and that phoney bitch
and her stupid dreams, I’ve had enough.
Yes.
Well, I don't care about any of them, really.
I don't care what pictures they take,
or who finds her.
Just as long as we get her back.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me. I wonder if I could trouble you
for one of those cards.
- I’m sorry?
- Your name, ma'am.
I’m supposed to make a note of everybody
who comes and goes.
Oh.
- Yes, of course.
- It’s purely for the record. Thank you.
Oh, by the way, those bods
hanging about the gate, reporters...
Take my tip and walk right past.
You don't want to get mixed up with them.
Oh, no, of course not.
Thank you for telling me. I’ll use the other gate.
She wants some cocoa and some potato crisps.
We haven't got any, have we?
- We have cocoa.
- What about the crisps?
Listen.
Turn out the lights.
(Car doors open and shut)
(Doorbell rings)
(Doorbell rings)
Nothing.
(Banging)
(Door rattles)
That's the garage door.
Is it locked?
Yes.
How about the back door, though?
Supposing they go round the back?
Go and make sure.
Be careful.
(Footsteps approach)
(Footsteps retreat)
(Crash)
AMANDA: Doctor!
Nurse!
Nurse I want you  !
Nurse!
Doctor!
(Car doors slam)
(Car drives off)
Nurse!
Nurse I want you  !
All right.
Go and see what she wants.
And put your mask on.
I’ll get her drink ready.
It slipped off
Oh, dear.
Well, accidents will happen.
I thought perhaps you'd fallen out of bed.
The nurse is just making your drink.
Did you enjoy your dinner?
I don't like eating in bed. You get all crumbs.
Yes, I’ve found that.
Are you really a doctor?
Yes, of course.
You don't smell like a doctor.
Don't I?
Well, what do doctors smell like?
All pepperminty.
Well, we'll have to do something
about that, then, won't we?
Nurse will be up in a tick.
You'll be all right.
(Door is locked)
What was it?
Oh, er, she...she just dropped her tray.
She's really bright, you know. Really quite bright.
What about the police? Will they be back?
Yes, but not tonight.
- Watch that, will you? It’s about to boil.
- Well, they must suspect something.
Everyone's under suspicion
once they've made contact.
I knew they'd call. They were just
a little more efficient than I’d imagined, that's all.
I’m not ready for that.
I...I think we should take her back now.
Tonight, while there's still time.
- Now, I need some sugar.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Sugar.
- It’s not going to work.
If we do something now,
we might just get away with it.
What would we get away with, Billy? Nothing.
We'd just be taking all the risks,
with none of the benefits.
Myra...
we com...
I committed a criminal act.
I kidnapped her, I didn't borrow her.
And they're onto us.
They made a call, that's all,
as part of a routine investigation.
If they'd had any strong suspicions,
they never would have left so easily,
would they?
But they'll be back. You said so yourself.
Yes, they'll be back, but not tonight.
They won't be back tonight.
First thing tomorrow morning.
What difference does it make?
A great deal of difference, Billy.
She won't be here tomorrow morning.
(Clattering)
Billy, what was our plan?
Our beautiful, perfect plan.
How brave, how excited we were.
Don't you remember conceiving it?
Have you forgotten, Billy?
We were going to do something
so perfect, so pure,
that would harm no-one,
would only do good.
And we've made a start, a wonderful start.
It’s all going exactly as we said.
And when we've done the nest
and we've got the ransom money
and it's all over the front pages
that's when it will all come true for us, Billy.
I’ll make it come true.
I'II tell them where she can be found
and where the money is hidden.
Well, I have to do this little lie, Billy,
so they can know the whole truth.
That's what you want, isn't it?
That's what you've always wanted.
Ever since...
Well, ever since I can remember.
You've wanted nice things for me,
haven't you?
That's true, isn't it?
Yes, that's true, dear.
So you know what you have
to do tonight.
Just as we rehearsed it.
(Telephone rings)
Yes, Barnet 3... Charles Clayton here.
(Gruffly ) This is Longfellow.
Keep him talking as long as you can.
Yes, yes, I’m here.
Where's my little girl?
What have you done with my baby?
Please tell me she's all right
I... I... Hello?
Hello?
Yes, well... (Clears throat)
Listen carefully.
Yes, yes, I’m listening.
Have you got the money ready?
- Yes
- In the BOAC bag?
- Yes
- Then listen to me
Go alone to Leicester Square
to the phone box nearest to the taxi rank
in the northwest corner
Yes, sir? Yes.
- Keep him talking. They're tracing it.
- I’m listening.
Go inside it, and wait there.
Don't do anything.
Don't use the phone.
Just go inside and wait there.
- Have you got all that?
- Yes.
Would you repeat that last part again, please?
Northwest corner, last booth.
Northeast...
West. West.
I’ve said it three times.
- Have you got it now?
- Yes.
- Well, that's all, then.
- Wait.
Don't hurt my baby.
About bleedin' time an' all.
(Siren)
Where to?
That could have been fatal
if I hadn't made you turn your pockets out.
Yes, I’m...
I’m not a master criminal, you know.
- Is it clear outside?
- Yes, absolutely. Shall I take her?
No, you take care of those.
- Are you sure she won't wake up?
- She couldn't possibly.
I’ve been thinking, what if the police
haven't been by the time I get back?
What?
Oh, yes, that is something.
Well, we'd better have a signal, then.
I’ll, er...
I’ll hang a shirt on the line and leave it
there, until the police have been and gone.
Yes, right.
If it's still there, keep driving round
and coming back to check.
Otherwise, stick exactly to the plan.
Yes.
- Yes?      - I'm a police officer,
Detective Sergeant Beedle
- Could I have a word with you, Mrs Savage?
- Well, yes, of course. Won't you come in?
*O For The Wings Of A Dove
- Excuse me.
- Please.
(Music stops)
We er... We called last night,
but er...you were out, I think.
Oh, yes, we were.
- It’s not about the radio licence, is it?
- No it's nothing like that
No, it's nothing at all, really. It’s just a check.
It’s in connection with that little girl
missing from Barnet.
After your visit yesterday, the police at Barnet
asked us to check - character and so on.
I was able to tell them
that you weren't known officially to us,
and that was all above board.
They asked
if we'd just have a look round the house.
He doesn't work in this area, does he?
Your husband?
He doesn't work at all, I'm afraid
He suffers from ill health.
Oh, yes. I remember my wife mentioning it.
Asthma, isn't it?
Yes.
Sometimes it's worse than others.
This isn't your room, I take it?
No my husband's. He sometimes uses
it when he gets an attack
It’s fairly dust-free.
Right.
This is where I hold my meetings.
Do you? Yes.
Well, I’m not taking sides one way or the other.
I keep out of it where my wife's concerned.
Still, I suppose there's something in it.
I think so.
Well, you would, of course, yes.
What about Mr Savage? Does he go along?
He believes in what I believe.
What does your husband drive? A Mini?
No, er...
..just an old motorbike.
It’s William Savage, isn't it?
William Henry.
Oh, yes.
My wife was trying to remember.
- Longfellow.
- Wait. Wait. Wait!
GUARD: Mind the doors
(Car door closes)
(Engine starts)
(Car drives away )
(Door opens and closes)
How... How is she?
She's all right, I think. None the worse.
A bit hot, perhaps.
I kept looking at her whenever I could.
- You weren't followed, were you?
- No, I doubled back a couple of times just in...
Hot, you say?
- Yes, nothing much.
- Oh, but you said hot.
- You hid the money, did you?
- Yes, but what do you mean, hot?
What I said, Billy, what I said.
A bit hotter than usual, that's all.
Yes, but what does that mean?
It means, and do not shout at me, that
she has a bit of a temperature, I suppose.
It’s nothing unusual in children.
How would you know?
We're mad, you and me.
We're both mad.
Are you asleep?
Myra, are you asleep?
What is it?
Come in here a minute.
- What's wrong?
- Well, come and look at her.
- With my uniform on?
- It doesn't matter. She won't...
Look, just come and look.
You feel her forehead.
Now, tell me that's normal.
She is still very hot.
Well, of course she's hot.
I... I took her temperature. It’s way up.
Get another blanket. There.
We'll...have to get a...a doctor.
Billy, don't be stupid.
What do you mean, don't be stupid?
Where are you going? What's stupid about it?
The child's ill. We've got to have a doctor.
Don't walk away when I’m talking.
What are you doing?
I’m telling you what we've got to do.
Look, put that down
and listen to me for a minute.
What are you looking in here for?
I’m telling you what the answer is.
Are you, Billy? Are you?
The answer's so simple, is it?
We just call the doctor.
Now, what should we say to him, do you think?
Should we say that we've borrowed a ch...?
Oh, you don't like that word, do you?
Um, we'll say we've kidnapped a child
and ask him to treat it in confidence.
Is that what we should do, Billy?
And we don't really know
if there's anything wrong at all, do we?
We'll get medicine for her in the morning.
There's no harm that can come to her
in a warm bed.
I don't know. I don't know
anything any longer.
Except you do know I’m right,
don't you?
That I’m right.
Now we have to take turns to sit in with her.
Do you want to take the first turn or shall I?
I’ll take it.
Billy.
Billy!
What is it?
The mother's disappeared.
We can't hold your meeting this afternoon
We must put it off
I’m giving half the adult dose.
Do you think that's all right?
Once every four hours.
That means one now and one at 2:30.
Myra, we must put it off.
The very worst thing we could do
is change the normal routine.
The baby will be in the next room.
That's right, Billy, and you will sit with her
after you've got everyone in.
We're not going to put it off, Billy.
It would just make people suspicious.
I’m not putting it off.
(Door closes)
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Will you go up, please?
(Doorbell rings)
Excuse me. Sorry.
Oh good afternoon
Good afternoon.
Is Mrs Savage holding
her usual meeting this afternoon?
- Oh, yes, won't you come in, please?
- Thank you.
- You haven't been before, have you?
- No, I haven't.
- May I have your name, please?
- Clayton. Mrs Clayton.
Upstairs. The er...
(Clears throat) The room's upstairs.
Oh. Thank you.
Straight ahead.
Yes, I’ve just seen her.
I thought she might come.
But you can't with the child in here.
You just can't.
Oh, yes, Billy, yes.
Oh, it's good that she's come. Don't you see?
It’s good. It strengthens my connection.
Now I can help her.
I can help her, Billy.
Now she can share my truth.
(Door opens)
Good afternoon.
Shall we make our circle?
MYRA: What? What is it?
He had a car.
A red car.
Going over a bridge.
Going home.
Happy.
Oh, they're all singing.
He sends his love
That's my Fred. That's my darling.
Take good care of all at No.43.
I will. I will, my darling.
We put flowers on your grave last Sunday,
me and the girls.
Somebody else.
Worried.
Somebody on my left.
Your guardian angel
has put candles on both your knees.
One on each knee
A white one on the left
and a blue one on the night
He's telling you not to worry.
Mummy.
You are worried
About a...
..a...church.
No.
About a child.
Mummy.
You're worried about a little girl.
Mummy.
Oh, yes.
No need to worry.
No need
She's quite safe
She's being taken care of by three...
..three people.
They're concerned about her future happiness.
Mummy
Oh, she's playing. She's...happy. She's...
All the future is happiness.
- Mummy.
- Sh.
When...
When will I see her again?
What is it, Arthur? What?
Well, say it then, Arthur.
Please. When will I see her?
Mummy.
Please.
When?
No.
No, Arthur.
No, no.
No.
(Thud)
What is it, dear?
Die.
It’s all right. She'll be all right
in a minute.
It’s all right, dear. You're all right.
You fainted.
Really?
Silly of me.
I fainted?
- Very silly of me.
- Just sit quietly for a minute.
I think perhaps we'll stop it
here for today.
Yes, yes, of course, Mr Savage.
If, um, someone could perhaps help me,
I’ll get her to her room.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Let me.
Mrs Savage, who is going to die?
- Die?
- Yes, you said the word. Who was it for?
Was it to do with me?
Nobody's dead.
No, not dead, die.
I distinctly heard you say it.
No.
Nobody's dead
BILY: Look, if you don't mind...
I'II just see them out
Are you sure you'll be all night?
I do apologise.
Please accept my wife's apologies.
She's over-tired, l think.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
Oh, what do I owe Mrs Savage?
- Oh, nothing, nothing, please.
- But I must. I...
Well, I’ll send her something through the post.
- Please, I assure you.
- Oh, no, I’d like to.
You see, I...
I am so worried, and...
she has given me some hope.
Whatever my wife told you,
I’m sure will come true.
You will thank her for me, won't you?
Yes, of course.
Billy
Billy, I’ve got something to tell you,
something tremendous to tell you.
Come in here.
Oh, there you are.
I was just going to call you again.
Isn't it a wonderful afternoon?
I’m always so surprised,
it's so bright after a seance.
Brightness just seems to fall from the air.
Have you noticed?
Yes.
No, you don't notice.
Yes, I do.
What is it you want to tell me?
Arthur was very close this afternoon.
He was so close, he kept talking about...love.
That was the word he used.
He was chattering on.
I couldn't keep up with him.
He so wants her to be happy.
Her?
Yes, the child. He's grown so fond of her
since she's been using his room.
That's what gave him the idea.
Idea? What idea?
Well, it's very simple, really.
And, as Arthur says, it's the answer
for all of us.
And for the plan.
He says she doesn't really want
to go back.
He says she'd be much happier with him.
Then they'd have to take notice of me,
wouldn't they?
I mean, they couldn't ignore me
if we do what he says.
It would make the whole thing
that much more important.
And he kept saying how much
happier she'd be,
if we sent her to him.
Myra.
Arthur didn't say anything.
You said it. It was you.
It’s what you've been thinking.
- But he said it.
- It’s you. It’s all you.
- Of course he said it.
- Arthur doesn't... Arthur doesn't exist.
He's never existed.
He was dead. He didn't live.
He was dead, Myra. He was born dead.
You never saw him.
I was the only one who saw him.
They wouldn't let you see him.
It’s you, Myra. It’s always been you.
- No. No! No!
- Yes, it has. It’s what you want.
Yes! This last thing was you.
You thought of it.
You're the one who wanted her to die.
You thought of it. It’s only in your mind.
That's not true. You mustn't say that.
- That is not true.
- Arthur is dead.
You wanted him so much, but he's dead!
All those clothes you've got upstairs,
and the room, that's in your mind, too.
- You don't have to say it.
- Yes. Yes, l have to say it.
And you have to hear me.
This time you have to hear me!
Say it. Arthur is dead. He was born dead.
- Billy, please.
- Go on, say it.
Say it!
No!
I know he's dead. I know that.
I do know that.
But I do talk to him. And
he does talk to me.
Please don't make me say
he doesn't talk to me. Please.
I do, and I see him.
I am different. I do see him.
That's why I want her. She makes me
feel so much closer to him.
That's why Billy
Oh, Myra.
Oh, Myra, what to do now?
That's what I have to think about,
what to do now.
I have to think. I have to think.
- Billy.
- Myra, don't say any more.
- Billy.
- Just let me think.
Billy, please.
Just do this for me. Just let me keep her.
It wouldn't be fair to take her away from me now.
Mummy
You go back to bed.
You'll catch cold.
What were they all shouting about?
Well...it was just a game.
This isn't really a hospital, is it?
Hospitals are all white
You stay in bed this time,
like a good girl.
You'll be home soon, I promise.
I must have...left her door unlocked.
Yes, Billy.
Rushing in to see you.
Yes, Billy.
She's seen you, Billy.
She's seen your face.
Do it for me, Billy.
Then we can both be safe for ever.
See how easy it was, Billy.
She didn't suffer
She didn't feel anything.
She just went to sleep.
Now she's safe with Arthur.
You don't want me
to say that any more, do you?
I won't. I promise you, I won't.
Because of all the things
you've done for me.
Billy, look at me.
I won't ever forget.
Just a few more hours, and I’ll go
and tell them where they can find her.
Then it'll all come true.
Just as Mummy said
You cold?
You look cold.
It feels cold in this room
I mean, even in the afternoon when the sun
comes in, it never really warms it up.
Billy, we won't stay here once it's over.
Once it's over we'll go away
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
We'll never quarrel again.
I’ll just do things to please you.
Say you love me.
You know I love you.
I want to...read over exactly what
it is I want to say.
(Knock at door)
That's the evening paper
Would you get it Billy?
* MENDELSSOHN: O For The Wings Of A Dove
This is erm...
..Superintendent Walsh, dear.
Superintendent Walsh.
Good evening Mrs Savage. I'm sorry
to call on you like this without warning
Oh, that's quite all right.
You know Sergeant Beedle, I believe.
Good evening, Mrs Savage.
Yes, we had a long talk a few days ago.
As a matter of fact, that's why
I’m calling on you.
Once again, this is not an official
visit as such.
Just thought perhaps you might be able
to help us further in your professional capacity.
I’m sorry, I...
The little girl missing from Barnet.
You gave the parents some information
I believe
Yes, that's right.
Before l go any further, Mrs Savage,
I think I ought to say that off-duty,
I’m not a non-believer.
As a matter of fact, I’m president
of my local society for psychical research.
Oh, are you? How very interesting.
Yes, it is. Very.
I’m a very keen president.
I’ve had one or two papers published,
just our own magazine,
mostly concerned with the Kroner experiments.
Oh. Oh, yes.
Of course, I know the Kroner experiments.
As I’m sure you know, they followed them up
in Austria with startling results.
I went into it, when I was there
on holiday last year.
A busman's holiday, I suppose.
I like to get to the end of things.
That's why I’m here.
I wondered if you would consider
holding a seance for me.
Here, this evening?
Well, if it's at all possible.
We seem to have drawn a blank
with orthodox methods.
Since you did make contact before,
you might be of great help again.
Of course, it's only a request.
You're quite at liberty to refuse.
What er...
What help do you think my wife could give you?
Well, in a case like this, Mr Savage,
we are grateful for small mercies.
Since your wife appears to have powers beyond
the ordinary, I’d like to make use of them.
You already enjoy
a very considerable reputation, Mrs Savage
- Do I?
- Oh yes indeed
News in our particular circle, if I may put it
like that, may not travel widely,
but it travels very surely.
You want me to give you exact information
about the little girl, is that it?
Well, it doesn't have to be exact, Mrs Savage.
Just a clue, that's all we're looking for.
MYRA: And you want to have the seance now?
SUPERINTENDENT WALSH:
If that's at all possible
Speaking as a policeman now
time isn't exactly on our side.
Well, I...usually have a circle.
Well, I thought we'd ask Beedle here,
and Mr Savage.
Oh, my husband isn't a regular sitter.
I don't think that matters
I’d like him to be in this one.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Do you suppose you can get the station
on the car radio from here?
- Well, I can't say for certain, sir.
- You don't know?
- I’m not positive.
- Do you think it's possible?
Well, yes, but I couldn't say
for sure, sir.
Right, you wait outside.
I’m so sorry.
Er, right, Mrs Savage,
if you'll show us where.
Oh, yes.
This way, please.
Billy.
Oh, I haven't...
I haven't got a match.
Match? Will a lighter do?
Oh, yes, please.
Would you turn out the light?
The Superintendent there.
Billy over there.
Mr Beedle.
Is there anything special
you want us to do?
No.
It’s a great help to me if we all give
ourselves up completely and concentrate.
Nothing special.
I have no tricks.
I’m sure you don't need them, Mrs Savage.
Could we all join hands?
And now, concentrate on one thing.
Empty your minds of everything
except the subject.
Oh, oh, it's tea time.
Take my hand, precious. It’s tea time.
You have to go downstairs.
Everybody's waiting.
Downstairs.
You have to be a good girl today.
Good girl.
No, no, no good saying you're tired.
It’s Sunday. You're never tired on a Sunday.
Mummy
You've got butter on your chin
Look!
I’m standing.
At the top of the stairs.
Look at me.
Stop that shouting.
No, I won't! I won't!
No, don't.
Don't make me go downstairs again.
Don't make me go today.
I want to stay with Arthur.
Arthur.
He was dead when he was born. Dead!
You can't see him. You can't see him.
You...won't let me see him.
All that waiting.
All that time.
For nothing.
Nothing to hold.
Only Billy.
(Myra gasps)
Arthur, why are you waiting
under the tree alone...
..in the dark?
Why are you...waiting there?
Mummy, why are you waiting under the tree?
No. It’s so different.
I said die.
Die.
They said dead. He's not.
He is not dead. He is not.
Otherwise, why are you waiting there...all alone?
She should be there.
She should have come by now
Where is she? She...
Oh
She was here. She was here.
In Arthur's room.
Oh, she saw him. She saw Billy.
She saw him
She saw him
Ah, yes. I’m coming, precious.
I’m coming. I’m coming.
Billy, take her now.
You take her, Billy. Take her. Kill her.
Arthur's waiting
Billy take her. Billy kill her.
Billy take her. Arthur's waiting
He's waiting Billy
I’m coming.
Precious, I’m coming.
I’m...coming. Really. You wait.
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait for me.
Wait for me.
Sh.
Where did you hide the money, Mr Savage?
In the coal bunker.
In the garden.
She's all right, is she?
I put her where the Scouts
could find her.
Did I do it right, Billy?
Yes, dear.
