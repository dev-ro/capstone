- Okay, Dolemite, the
warden wants to see you.
- Oh, shit.
What the hell does
that rat-soup-eatin'
motherfucker want with me?
- Come on outta there.
We ain't got all day.
- Sit down, Dolemite.
You can leave.
You know mama, Queen
Bee, here, I'm sure.
You should be very proud of her.
For damn near two years,
she's been bugging
me about your innocence.
You know, a funny thing is,
I'm about to believe her.
What I mean is, we have,
with her help, of course,
stumbled onto some facts
that may set you free.
Of course, they
have to be proven.
And that's where you come in.
Now you're a gambling
man, aren't you?
- It depends on
the game, Warden,
and how high the stakes are.
- Well I might as
well level with you.
The game is rough and
the stake is your life.
But it means the
difference between
being free or rotting
here behind bars
'til someone tries
to set you free.
You know there's
not a lawyer in LA
who'll touch your case.
So what do you say?
You wanna play ball or not?
- Whose team am I on Warden?
And what am I supposed to do?
- Okay, I'll run it down to you.
You're serving a 20 year stretch
for the possession
of stolen furs
and a half a million
dollars worth
of narcotics, right?
- Right.
- Get behind the trees.
- Hold it!
- What do you want man?
- FBI.
- What do you want?
- Open your trunk.
- There's nothin' in my trunk.
Where's your warrant at?
- This is the FBI, this
is my search warrant.
- There's nothin'
in my trunk man.
- Open up the trunk.
- That shit ain't mine.
I don't know how it got there.
- You're under arrest.
- You're gonna have to take me!
- Ah, ah.
- One more move and you're dead!
- This the guy you said would
take an army to capture?
- I thought it would.
You find his stuff?
- Yeah, dope, stolen
furs, everything.
- Well, goodbye boy.
You're off to a
long, long, vacation.
- I got your boy hangin'.
You no-business bond, insecure,
junkyard motherfucker!
- Right on schedule.
- Well good.
Get in the car.
We'll celebrate.
- Well for the two
years you've been here,
the dope traffic in your
neighborhood hasn't changed.
In fact, it's gotten worse.
Guns and dope are being sold
to school children every day.
Black gangs are
killing each other.
Queen Bee, here,
informs me that,
maybe you better
tell him, Queenie.
- Dolemite, it's
real bad out there.
Some gang killed your
nephew the other day.
He was comin' home
the other day,
just him and his girlfriend.
And they wasn't
botherin' nobody.
- Somebody had to
sell the gun to the
lad that pulled the trigger.
He's in jail, but so what.
There's many more
of 'em out there.
- So they killed little Jimmy?
- That's right.
He was walkin' home from school
and he wasn't botherin' nobody.
Just him and his girl.
- What am I supposed
to do, Warden?
- All right, I
understand you know
some of the people we suspect.
And we feel there are
policemen mixed up in it.
Now, I told you the
job was dangerous
and you could lose your life.
But you're tough.
You know how to roll
with the punches.
The name of the
game is stay alive.
Now I've talked to the
governor about you.
There are only four
people who know
why you're on the street.
The governor, Queen Bee, myself,
and one FBI man
that nobody knows
'til the time comes.
So what do you say, Dolemite?
- When do I get
outta here, Warden?
- Tomorrow.
You go back to your cell now
as if nothing's happened.
You'll be released
in the afternoon.
- Thank you, Queen Bee.
- Oh, Dolemite, I'm so happy.
I'ma tell everybody you
comin' home tomorrow.
- Oh, Dolemite.
- Yes, Warden?
- You do know a man by the name
of Willie Green, don't you?
- Some folks
say that Willie Green
was the baddest motherfucker
the world ever seen.
But I want you to
hold onto your seats.
And hold on to them tight.
'Cause you're now gettin'
ready to see the story of me.
Yes, me,
The badass,
Dolemite.

Goddamn, Mama, you must

...I am.
- What's your name?
- It's Chi, short for Chicago.
- I hope you ain't as
cold as the windy city,
because the way I feel now baby,
I could sure warm you up.
- As long as you been gone baby,
you gotta whole lotta
warmin' up to do.
- No shit, baby.
- I can dig it.
I ain't gonna lie.
- Here change this.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Yes baby you can get behind
me and in front of me, too.
Do you dig it?
Whoo!
- You still need these.
- I don't wanna get in
my car with this shit on.
I'm glad y'all brought
my clothes to me.
You see what the guards give me
to get outta jail in.
Bitch, you bring me these
goddamn cotton draws.
You know I don't wear
no fuckin' cotton draws.
Oh, I like these.
Who made this?
You, guard, I want
you to take these
cheap motherfuckers and
wipe your ass with 'em.
- Oh no, Dolemite,
we'll keep 'em here.
You'll be back.
- There they go, let's get 'em.
- Remember, we
want Dolemite dead.
- What about the broads?
- Ah, forget em.
- I think we got company.
We're being tailed.
- Hand me my piece.
Pull over and stop the car.
Pull up aways, I'll
take it from there.
- Alright, girls, turn
the goddamn motor off.
Get out Dolemite!
- Dolemite's not in here.
- Don't give us here
that bullshit, baby.
We know he's here.
- Look
for yourself motherfucker.
- She's tellin' the truth.
He's not here.
- Well where is he?
- Breathin' down your neck.
Alright, hold it, move.
Girls, come here.
Come here, girls.
I've been wantin'
see me a honky dance.
Dance, motherfucker, dance!
Dance!
Dance!
Girls, this motherfucker's
got rhythm, hasn't he?
- Rhythm, rhythm.
- Come on girls, let's make it.
- Help me!
- Wait a minute,
Dolemite, I'll help him.
- Let's go.
- Queen Bee, it's awful
good to be back home.
- I'm glad you're
home, too, baby.
It takes a whole lot
of weight off my back
since you're home.
It's so good you home.
- By the way, Queen Bee,
where are these
guns coming from?
- Dolemite, I
honestly don't know.
You think maybe
it's Willie Green?
- I've known Willie
Green for a long time.
Willie Green plays
for high stakes.
He's into more than guns.
Oh, by the way, Queen Bee,
it looks like somebody's
missin' from the family.
- Oh, yes, Peggy.
She split right after you left.
She's dancin' for
Willie Green right now.
- Speakin' of dancin', who's
taking care of the club now?
You know, I got some
big ideas for that club.
- Wait a minute, wait.
We don't have the club anymore.
- What do you mean we don't
have the club anymore?
You know that club
was my pride and joy
and you've gone and give it up.
- I didn't give away shit.
We lost it.
Me and these girls
had to sell pussy
on the goddamn corner.
Tryin' to save your black ass.
We almost lost this house.
You know what?
Mitchell and White
would bust us every week.
$5,000 a whop.
Until all the money was gone.
And we still owe
Willie Green $50,000.
- Who's runnin' the club now?
- Willie Green.
Lookie here.
You remember Creeper, right?
He's a little old
friend of yours.
Now, he knows a lot of things
and he know a lot of people.
And since he's your friend,
he might be able to
tell you a little somethin'.
Why don't you give him a call?
- Queen Bee, you know darn well
that Creeper ain't never paid
a phone bill in his life.
- True, but you know
where he hang out at.
- Is the Fat Burger
joint still in business?
- Oh, yes.
That's where the penny pimps
and the nickel and
dime hustlers hang out.
When they ain't got no money
and tricks be kinda slow.
But look here.
I noticed that the warden
told you that you'd be alone.
But Dolemite, you
ain't never been alone.
When you were doing your time,
I put your girls
through karate school.
And they are good, too.
I remember one time
a trick came in here
and tried to misuse us.
- What happened to my $100 Joe?
Nigga, did you take my money?
- That's
right little bitch.
I took it back.
You ain't worth no $100.
I am Joe Blow, the lover man.
You should be paying me, bitch.
- Give me my money, man.
- Shit, what money?
Shit, I get cunt
like you all clay,
a dime a dozen, shit.
Here, here's $2.
Go get you some dish
powder and keep it clean
for me next time.
- And they whipped his ass.
He's in the hospital yet
with his ass in a sling.
You used to be
pretty good yourself.
- Oh, but Queen Bee,
I think I need mine
brushed up a little bit.
- I'm goin' to change clothes.
Come on, let's go on the
other side the house.
Okay?
- Hey, where's Flo?
- Flo.
- Hi, honey.
- How's tricks?
- Couldn't be better.
Am I gonna see you tonight?
- No, no, no, not now.
I got business to take
care of on the east side.
See ya.
- You always got
business somewhere else
when it comes to me, nigga.
That's the trouble with
you black motherfuckers.
- Hey Flo.
- You get a
fuckin' bitch in your car,
- Flo!
- And then you always
wanna fuck all over her.
' Flo!
- Hello, sweetheart.
Can I help you?
- Yeah, um, I'd like a massage.
Please.
- Well, I think that they're
doin' it right over here baby.
♪ And here we are together
♪ Lying side by side
♪ And my body trembles as you're
♪ Touching me
♪ Heartbeat is burnin' baby
♪ Deep inside of me
- What took you so long?
- How did you know I
was comin' up here baby?
- I thought about
what you told me
so I sent down my little
cool wings to bring you up.
♪ I feel the power
♪ I yearn to know ya

- Hold on a minute.
I wanna talk to you Dolemite.
- Man, move over and let me pass
before I have to be
pullin' these hush puppies
out your motherfuckin' ass.
- Alright, get your
hands on your head, boy.
- What the shit is this?
- Just spin around and
put your hands on the car.
- Oh, fuck, I
ain't done nothin'.
- No, you haven't yet,
but you will.
- Well, well, what have we here?
- Oh, Lordy, let me see that.
Oh, wow.
This looks like the
real stuff all right.
Ah.
Oh, yeah, that's good.
That's the real McCoy all right.
What about this boy?
- What about what?
- You must be high
or somethin' fella.
I'm talking about
all the dope I found
under your seat.
And there's more stashed
where that came from.
- Now you just got through
doin' time for stuff,
and now here you are,
right back at it again.
- Another frame up, hmm.
- That's right.
Now I'm gonna warn you,
but only one time.
See they told us that
you're a troublemaker.
That you're no good.
That you don't know how
to get along with people.
Now, I know you
think you're smart,
see, 'cause you got all
them flashy clothes,
you got that big car there,
and you got all them black
bitches workin' for ya.
- You forgot about
the white ones.
- You move your ass
outta this town,
and you move it fast.
- You better listen to him, boy.
Don't and somethin'
nasty's gonna happen to ya.
- And just to show ya
that we mean business...
- That's for fuckin' with
me, you no-business-born
insecure motherfuckers!
- I'll have that
stupid son of a bitch
in jail in two hours.
- Just look at that
damn Watergate scandal.
Now, if the leader
of our country
is stealing and
getting away clean,
what the hell do
they expect us to do?
- Better believe it brother.
- Right on.
- Tell the truth!
- And they've got
everything going for them,
and we've got nothing.
- He can tell
us whether he will or not.
- Remember, we live here
with the rats and roaches.
So we don't need no more
rats telling us what to do.
Amen.
- We will create our own war,
- Right on.
- That's right.
- And we don't need
no redneck mother,
oh yes, Lord.
Mothers are the best
friends we have.
And Oh Lord,
look down
on us poor servants down here.
And teach us how to
love one another.
- All right, Reverend,
cut the bullshit.
You probably been up here callin'
us every name in the book.
At ease, boys.
Ain't nobody down here
for you this time.
We're lookin' for Dolemite.
You seen him or not?
- No, I haven't.
But if I see him,
I'll let him know
that you're looking for him.
- Ah, that's mighty
black of you, Reverend.
Mike, check out the back.
I know you won't mind us
havin' a look around, will ya?
- No, no, go right ahead.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Preacher.
What do you got here?
- Oh, just some old
clothes for the poor.
- Old, dirty clothes, huh?
I'd hate to pay
your laundry bill.
Hey, Mitch.
Come here and look at
the man's old clothes.
- Ah, now Reverend, what
the hell is all this?
Now where'd you
get all these guns?
- They're just gifts
from the big man.
For the fourth ward.
In case of trouble
from the niggas.
- Okay, I'll check that out.
Um, uh,
I ain't seen nothing yet, uh,
did you see anything yet?
- Not me.
- Okay, carry on, Reverend,
uh if you see Dolemite...
- I'll tell him you're
looking for him.
- Yeah, right.
Okay.
- What else with
your burger, creeper?
- Uh, give me a
small coke and, uh,
some french fries.
- You know we don't
sell french fries.
- Ah, that's right,
that's right.
Yeah, anyway, uh,
ah, see somebody beat
me for my money.
Don't look at me like that.
Every time I come
around here, you know it.
Call the police, you
think I'm jivin'.
Just do that.
' Nigga. Please.
- Ah, yeah, well, uh,
I understand, uh,
is it alright if I

Hustle's good.
- Okay Creeper here,

You're holdin' up business.
- Alright, sista,

Boy, you know what?
That's sweetened bear meat.
Gonna marry it too.
How's that?
Sweetened bear meat.
- Alright.
- Say, brotha, hey.
Will you tell this
man you Dolemite, man?
I bet him $5 you Dolemite.
- Yes, brotha, I'm Dolemite.
- Prove it, prove it.
Listen man,
I'm not accustomed to
doing shows on the street.
I am openin' town this weekend.
And I'd appreciate
it if you brothers
get together and
come out and see me.
- Man, I ain't got
that kind of money.
This nigga say you Dolemite.
I bet him my last five dollas man.
Now I'm the one losin'.
- Brothers, I have
business to take care of.
I'm sorry.
- Man, play this track man,
so I don't lose my
last $5, please?
- Alright, man, alright.
- Right on, right on.
- One beautiful day in
the merry month of May.
Great Titanic, sailed away.
The captain and the lieutenant
was havin' a few words,
When the great Titanic
hit that mighty iceberg.
Shine was in the boiler
room eatin' some peas,
black-eyed peas, it was.
And the water came
damn near to his knees.
Before Shine could
take a bite of bread,
that water come darn
near up to his head.
Shine run up on the deck,
said, "Captain,
captain, captain",
"that water's damn
near up to my neck."
Captain said, "Shine,
go back, pack the sacks."
We gotta enough sacks,
to keep this water back."
You standin' up here, steady
bullshittin' and drinkin',
but can't you see this raggedy
hunk-a-junk is slowly sinkin'?
I said, "Cap I'll be in
New York unpackin' my trunk"
when the news reach the world,
"this junk done sunk."
The captain said, "Shine,
go back and fear no doubt",
'fore I take this
two-by-four and whack your
"black ass out."
Shine said, "Captain",
this shit you talkin'
mighta once been true,
but this is one time
your motherfuckin' talk
"ain't gonna do."
Shine just run and
jumped up in the ocean,
with his black ass doin'
a back wheel in motion.
I said, "Cap all these
rich broads run"
and jumped up on the top."
One broad hollered,
"Shine, stop!"
All this good stuff
to you I'll give
"if you make it possible
for me to live."
Shine said, "Bitch",
I like your shape
and I like your plan,
but you shoulda been
offering me your stuff
"when we was on dry land."
If I was in Mississippi and
asked you for a piece of trim,
you woulda had my
black ass hangin' from
the highest limb.
Is that enough fellas?
- No, no, Oh no, not that.
- Alright.
- Goddamn right, I got two.
- Here come another
broad out hollerin'.
Hollerin', "Shine, Shine, Shine."
I'm the captain's wife.
Why won't you help
me to save my life?
I've been through
the cotton fields
and I waded through the mills.
And, honey, I'm
a soul sista, baby
"and we from the same blood."
"You can talk so sweet
and you can sing so fine,"
but you shouldn't
of brought your
high yellow ass across
that darn color line.
But I'm the one you call
the boiler room flunkie,
now keep your ass on this ship
"and drown with these honkeys!"
When the news got around
the world that the great Titanic
had hit this big iceberg,
Shine was in Chicago,
on Cottage Grove and 63rd.
- Yeah.
- Down on his knees,
"There a nickle I shoot"
and a dime I hope to pass.
I left 10,000 rich motherfuckers
"swingin' on they ass."
And everybody wondered why
Shine didn't drown.
He had a card stuck
up in his butt
and he couldn't go down.
Well, if it isn't
the hamburger pimp.
Say, hamburger pimp.
- Hey fella, look here, you
don't know me man.
Who you talkin' to anyway?
You better get on before
you get jumped on.
- Now who bad enough
to do all of that?
- Me, nigga, me.
Shit, I'm so bad, I kick
my own ass twice a day.
Shit, he ain't sayin' nothin'.
Dolemite?
- Dolemite goddamn,
- Why you wanna do
me like that man?
Come on and let me
buy you a drink, huh?
- Are you sure
you can afford it?
- When'd you get out, mane?
- Yesterday.
- Say, boy this must be
my day hustlin' em good,
but, boy, you know

ridin' like motherfuckers

Fucked up brother.
Oh nigga Willie Green.

I mean when you was on the street,
everything was cool man.
Now they're scared to
wipe their asses man

They so cold they

on stuff so high.
You understand that an
honest dude like me,
I'm just snatchin' pocketbooks all
day to stay fixed, mane.
You know?
- Creeper,
let me make a deal with you.
I hear that a lot
of shit has been
going down since I left.
And if you can whoop
some information on me,
you won't have to
worry about your fix.
I'll whoop some
bread on your man.
Can you dig it?
- Yeah, that's cool.
Anyway, let's go to my pad, man.
- Where do you live man?
- Why man?
Is that cool?
- Let's move away from
here that way we can talk.
- Alright.
- Hey, nigga, where
in the hell you been?
- Creeper, I've known
you a long time.
You've been shootin' that shit.
Man, if you keep on,
it's gonna kill ya.
- I'm gonna cut it loose bro.
This my last one.
Ugh, right there.

just like they did
little Jimmy, man.
- What do you know

Do you know who

Do you know, man?

You ought to take a hit of this.
This some good stuff.
Mm.

Who killed Jimmy?
- Wait a minute, man.
Wait a minute.
- Man, who done it?

Who killed Jimmy?
- Lighten up, bra,

Man, wait a minute, man.
Damn.
It had to do with business stuff
over at the schoolhouse,
man, and uh,
he wanted out, man, and uh,
they wouldn't let him.
He went to the police, you know.
It didn't do no good.
One day, he was on
his way to the pad.
Lowriders passed by,
man, and blow him up.
You know, I'm comin'
outta the pawn shop.
You know, I seen it all.
I was comm' out
the pawn shop, man.
That's what happened.
That's the truth man.
- Alright, you're
under arrest, Dolemite.
Don't try any of
your funny shit now.
If he makes a wrong move, kill him.
- What's the charge
this time, man?
- This time it's murder.
Stick your hands out.
- It looks more like
slaughter to me.
- Reverend.
Reverend Gibbs, police officer.
Reverend Gibbs.
- It's the police.
Okay, I'm comin'.
- It's about time.
- Just shut up
and hide your black ass.
Be right there.
- Don't you curse me, Reverend.
- Police officer, Reverend.
- Yes, yes I know.
I want to ask you
a few questions.
Maybe you can help clear
up a few things for me.
- At your service.
- Two white police officers
came by to see you, right?
- That's right.
- What did they want?
- They were lookin' for Dolemite
and thought I had seem him.
- Why would they, uh,
look for Dolemite here?
- You know, I thought
about that myself.
- Say, do you know Willie Green?
- Oh, I see him around.
Now and then.
- Well, I'm gonna
give you a chance
to level with me, Reverend.
Who do you work for?
Willie Green or Dolemite?
- I work for nobody
but the Lord.
Because he said, "Blessed
are the pure at heart."
Amen!
- Are you pure at
heart, Reverend?
- Yes, sir, I am.
Amen.
Hallelujah!
- Then why you hidin' that
broad in the back room?
- What you talkin'
about brother?
The truth shall make you free!
- Well you listen to me,
you free preacher
son of a bitch!
Now I'm tired of your shit.
And let me tell you one thing.
When the shit hits
the fan, Reverend,

And I'm coming after you!
- Queenie, that bitch

Nobody steals in Dolemite house.
Get yo shit.

And they work for Willie

- Now you know how
lonesome I get without you.
I decided that I should start
doin' somethin' in my life.
- From the looks of things,
you've done pretty well.
- What do you mean by that?
- Whoever bailed me out
had to be stickin' pretty good.
I guess they bailed
me out so they could
take a crack shot at my ass.
- You know, you're such a bitch.
You don't even trust

And 23 of 'em are already gone.
You understand?

This is where the girls are.
- Now.
- Yah!
- Here's your girls.
What you think about 'em?
- I'll tell you one
thing, Queen Bee.
I wouldn't wanna tangle
with those tigers.
- Well that must mean that
they kind of rough, right?
- They good enough for me.
- This ain't nothin'.
You oughta see 'em when
they really work out.
Chow, chow, chow, you're out!
- They may have to work
out sooner than you think.
- You must be onto
something big.
- Queen Bee, I took the
club back from Willie Green.
And he's mighty
damn sore about it.
- Now how did you
manage to do that?
We owe him $50,000.
- Not anymore.
- Where did you
get the money from?
- Queen Bee,
it's one thing that I learned
when I was around 15 years old,
that if I ever went to prison,
it'd be for something big.
And I promised myself,
that when I got out, I'd
never be broke again.
So I paid Willie Green
every damn cent I owe him.
- Class dismissed.
- Let's go and
talk to the girls.
- ORGY-
Hang on, once I
talk to these girls.
Okay, girls, now turn around.
Dolemite wanna talk to you.
- Girls,
we have our club back.
But there will be problems.
We'll have problems
from the blacks
and the whites.
But from the
demonstration that I saw
out on the floor
a few minutes ago,
I know damn well
we can handle it.
- Right on, yeah.
- Girls, we gonna give one
of the damnedest parties
this city has ever seen.
Queen Bee is going to
send out invitations
to all of our friends
and associates
from all over the country.
And I'm gonna let 'em
know that Dolemite
is back on the scene.
I'm gonna let 'em know
that Dolemite is my name,
and fuckin' up
motherfuckers is my game.
Girls, I want you to go home
and get yourselves together.
And I'll see you at
the club tomorrow.
Can you dig it?
- Okay, girls, see ya tomorrow.
- Okay bye!
- Excuse me, everybody, um,
Miss Edwards would like
to make an announcement.
- Well good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,
and honored guests.
We're very happy to
be here this evening
to honor a very wonderful man.
A man, which we all
love so very much.
This man has done more for
the blacks than anyone.
The man I'm speaking of...
Let's give a warm
round of applause
to Mayor Daley
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
Now, I have to tell you that
we owe all of this to you.
And I appreciate it.
It's a wonderful party.
But it's a party and I'm only
going to say a few words.
Now, let me make
this perfectly clear.
No, no, when you go to the
polls again to vote,
and I thank you for electing me,
I want you to know,
these will still be clean.
- Can I help you, young man?
- Yes, sir, I'd like to
see Mayor Daley
- Do you have an
appointment, sir?
- Well not exactly, but um,
if you tell 'em that I'm here,
he'll wanna see me.
Well, I'm sorry.
The mayor doesn't see
uninvited guests in his home.
- No, no, no, look.
You go tell Mayor Daley
that Willie Green is here
from the fourth war.
And he'll see me,
now you get that?
Nigga.
- Yes sir, yes sir.
Right away.
- Just get yourself together.
Take him into the library.
- Darling, something
urgent has come up
Something unexpected.
- Okay.
- Just go ahead and enjoy
yourselves everybody.
I'll be back with you shortly.
Don't you know better
than to come to my home?
I transact business
in my office.
Now, what do you want?
- This is something that
can't wait for no damn office.
There's trouble at
the fourth ward.
- Trouble, what kind of trouble?
- Something that I'm not
gonna take the burnt end for.
- Well, all right, spill it.
- Dolemite just got out of jail
and he's causing
problems in my club.
Now you know Dolemite.
Once he gets on your back,
it's hard to get him off.
- NOW Willie.
You don't have to
worry about him.
I know he's back.
In fact, I had him bailed out.
So I can hit him,
whenever we're ready.
Just get on back to the club.
You just
keep the blacks together.
You just
keep things movin.
You know what I mean.
- You got it.
- I'll take care
of the Dolemite.
Mitchell,
Sheriff listen.
Take care, alright?
Keep my name clean.
And Mitchell
Listen, I don't
like Willie Green.
I don't want him
coming here anymore.
- Good afternoon,
Dolemite's Total Experience.
No he's not here.
Wait just a minute, I
think I hear him, oh-.
Dolemite, telephone for you.
- Dolemite here.
Yes Reverend.
What kind of tip
do you have for me?
$500!
Oh hell no, Reverend,
I'll give you two.
Meet you in 20 minutes?
Reverend, I can't be
there in 20 minutes.
Make it an hour.
Thanks, okay.
Goddamn, mama, this
sure is a spooky joint.
- Yeah, want me to wait outside.
- Hell no, not this time, mama.
I want you right by my side.
- I'm afraid of ghosts.
- Ghosts, if you
ever see a ghost,
cut the motherfucker.
- Good afternoon.
- What the hell is good
about scaring the hell
out of my woman here?
- You got the money?
- Give him the money baby.
How's business, Reverend?
- It could be better.
- What you got for me man?
- I know who set you up
and had you sent to prison.
I also know who's
behind Willie Green.
Here.
Take this address on the docks.
Go there tomorrow morning.
You might find it
very interesting.
If you get a chance
to check out the fish.
- Man, how am I going
out on that dock
snooping around without
somebody knowin' about it?
- Dolomite, you're no square.
You're seeking employment.
The man who does the
hiring is the connection
to the main line.
- Look like you got a
full house here, Rev.
Know any of these guys?
- Very well.
- Mmm.
Two dead ones and one live.
- Are you satisfied now?
- Gimme me back my money, man.
- Now why should I do that?
- Just say I open my
mouth and tell the police
about all the guns and all the
shit you got going on here.
- Then we'd have to
close it for you.
- Come on.
That's what I said
about you Reverend.
We asked you a
sensible question,
you come out with
a sensible answer.
Let's go baby.
Oh, by the way, Reverend.
Why you giving me all
this information anyway?
- Oh, just say it's
for the Lord, brother.
Besides, I don't like the MFs.
If you run into any
trouble, just give the word.
The big man sent me.
- Good answer, Reverend.
Later.
Cocaine, just what I expected.
Jenny Linch and Mary Love,
I want to thank
y'all so much for
coming out to be
with me tonight.

we wouldn't have missed

And now ladies and gentlemen,
the moment that you've
been waiting for,
the one man who has brought you
to Eat Out More Often and this Pussy
Belong to me.
But first to bring it
in time and in tune,
we are going to bring
you the Dolemite Dancers.
How 'bout it?
- Way down in the jungle deep,
the lion stepped on the
signified monkey's feet.
The monkey said,
"Motherfucker, can't you see?"
"You're standing on
my goddamn feet?"
The monkey lived in a
jungle in an old oak tree,
bullshittin' a lion
every day of the week.
Every day before
the sun go down,
that lion would kick his ass
all through the jungle town.
But the monkey got wise
and started using his wit,
start sayin' I'm gonna
put a stop to this
whole ass kickin' shit.
So he ran up on the
lion the very next day.
He said, "Oh, Mr. Lion",
"there's a big bad
motherfucker comin' your way."
"And he's someone
that you don't know,"
"he just broke-a loose from
Ringling Brothers' show."
"Said he talked about your
people in a hell of a way."
"He talked about your people
'til my hair turned gray."
"But Mr. Lion, you
know that ain't right."
"So whenever you run
up on the elephant"
"I want you to be ready to fight."
The lion jumped up
in a hell of a rage.
Like a young man
smokin' some gauge.
He ran up to the
elephant, talking with a smile.
He said, "All right, you
big bad motherfucker."
"It's gonna be
your ass or mine."
The lion jumped up
and made a fancy pass.
But the elephant
side stepped him
and knocked him dead on his ass.
He fucked up his jaw,
mess up his feet,
broke all four legs, and
knocked his ass outta place.
They fought all night
and all the next clay.
Somehow the little lion
managed to get away.
He drug his ass back to the
jungle more dead than alive,
just to run into
that little monkey
and some more of his signifying jive.
The monkey said,
"Look here, partner,"
"You don't look so swell."
"Look like to me you
caught a whole lotta hell."
Says, "your eyes is red
and your ass is blue",
said, "that I knew in the first
place it wasn't shit to you."
"But I told my wife
before you left"
"I shoulda whooped your
ass my motherfuckin' self."
"Shut up."
"Don't you roar 'cause
I'll jump outta this tree"
"and whoop your
dog ass some more."
"And don't look up here
with your sucker paw case,"
“cause I'll piss through
the bark of this tree
"in your motherfuckin' face."
Little monkey got happy and
started jumpin' up in his dawn.
His feet missed the limb,
his ass hit the ground.
Like a ball of lightning
and a streak of white heat,
that lion was on his
ass with all four feet.
Dust rose and tears came in
the little monkey's eyes.
Nothin' he could see and
nothin' he could hear,
but he knew that was
the end of his bullshit
and signified career.
And signified career.
- Alright, let's hear it!
Come back tomorrow
night, same time,
at Dolemite's Total Experience.
Thank you.
- Now here's an
expensive message.
And here's my tip.
- Hand me my shirt Chi.
I want you to go
back out in the club
as soon as I get dressed.
I'll be right out.
Can you dig it?
- Sure.
- You want to see me man?
- Aha, brother Dolemite.
Sit down, join the party.
Hey, this is the man
who owns the club.
Now, yeah.
Hey, what kind of
drink you want man?
- I don't think I care
to drink with you man.
- I wanna make a deal with you.
- What kind of deal?
- You cheated me.
You paid me a lousy $50,000.
- That's right, now
what's your problem?
- There's no problem,
it's just interest.
$100,000.
Come on, don't get excited.
Listen, uh,
why don't we make another deal?
Uh, you and me, partners.
Okay?
Uh, I saw your act,
you're pretty damn good.
You know your business.
You take care of the business,
I take care of the heat.
You can keep your
stingy $100,000.
- It's nice to have
seen you people.
But fuck you man.
- Gimme me the gun.
- What do you want the gun for?
- Gimme the gun!
- Here's the gun.
- I'm gonna kill Dolemite.
I don't want no sweat.
Let's turn the place out!
You the cook ain't you?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Dirty black bitch,
I'm gonna kill you.
Get this, bitch off of me
- Watch out.
- Goddamn, Dolemite.
Now it's off of you, it's on me.
You're hurt pretty bad.
We better get you
to the hospital.
- There's a back
way out the end.
- Okay, we're gonna take off.
- What the fuck do
you want, Mitchell?
- Yes, sir, I'm tellin'
sir, all hell broke loose
out here in the fourth ward.
Willie Green is dead,
a couple of his boys.
- Oh, hold on.
- Looks like Dolemite
did it, yes sir.
- Wait a minute.
Let me up.
Damn“.
Shit.
Shit.
Now where's the Dolemite?
Did you get him?
- No, sir, he's disappeared.
- You find him quick.
And kill him before he blows it.
And Mitchell, don't
you call me unless,
unless he's dead,
you hear me dead.
- Yes, sir.
- Eddie. Listen to me.
Now listen I don't
have much time.
I want you to put out a hunt,
and you find that
Dolemite and you hold him.
And when you get him, what?
- Good boy, Eddie.
Thank you, yeah.
No, no, no.
No everything's fine now.
Bye.
Now listen.
This is big man.
I want a contract
on the Dolemite.
He's at Morningside Hospital.
Room 2218.
Hit him.
Now what's this all about?
- It means, goddamn it,
I been waitin' for
your ass a long time.
Now sit down motherfucker.
- What are you doing with that?
- I said sit down.
- What are you doin'?
Now, look, I've
been good to you.
- Oh really?
Good treatment? You have
used me for long enough.
Sit down.
And I mean you have
killed a lot of my people.
Just shut up!
- Where's my wife?
- Stupid bitch is in there
sleepin' like a baby.
You know what, honey?
This is gonna give me
a whole lot of pleasure
sending you straight to
hell on this toilet seat.
- Careful with that.
Alright, I'll give you
everything you want...
- Old man, it's
too late for that.
- Please, please, don't kill me!
You crazy bitch!
- Welcome, Blakley.
We were expecting you.
- Okay, Mr. FBI man,
we're gonna put an end
to your spying around.
- Pull up his sleeve.
- Hey, what are
you guys gonna do?
- We're gonna turn you on
and then you're gonna
go in the pool and swim.
- I can't swim.
- Got it all ready now.
Enough to kill 10 cows.
- Block your arm.
- So I'm supposed to be
found ODed in that pool.
- That's right.
- Hey, you guys are
gettin' away with murder.
Look, your boss is getting
away with the loot.
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- Look behind you.
Your boss is getting away.
- And to add another burden
to your problem, Dolemite,
there's a contract on you.
- Oh no, honey.
- I guess you come
here to fill it.
- Matter of fact, I came
here to try and stop it.
- Well, I'll be damned.
You know, I thought you was just
another one of them
jive ass rooty tootie cops.
- You know you
started a lot of shit
in this town, Dolemite.
But I think I know who
put the contract on you.
Tonight we're gonna
try and solve it.
- What am I to do man?
Lay up here and let 'em take
a crack shot at my black ass?
- Not exactly.
I got a master plan going.
I'll talk to the
head of the hospital.
And we decided to
change the number
on your room downstairs.
Now I need your and Chi's help.
Here's what I want you to do.
- Dr. Sullivan.
Calling Dr. Sullivan.
You're wanted in
the emergency room.
Dr. Feelgood,
calling Dr. Feelgood
you're wanted in
inhalation therapy.
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes, I'm Mr. Burns.
These are my associates.
There's a friend
of mine, Dolemite?
In room 2218?
I'd like to check on him.
- Oh yes, Mr. Burns,
but if I'm not mistaken,
the room is 2210.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch.
- Just in time, man, thanks, baby.
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, man, I feel fine.
Tell Blakely I'm alright.
- There's more to come.
Sit tight, I'll be around.

I'll blow your brains
all over the wallpaper.
- Alright, afro, on your feet.
Place that hand on your head.
You're comin' with us.
- You rat-soup-eatin'
honkey motherfucker!
- Drop it, Mitchell.
You too, White.
- What the hell's
the matter with you, Blakely?
- Are you all crazy?
This man's a murderer.
I gotta take him in.
- I'll take him in
along with the both of you.
I'm onto your game, Mitchell.
It's all over.
I work for the FBI.
And I'm gonna see that
the both of you do time.
Take 'em out of here officer.
- You know the routine.
- You better think about
what you're doin' man.
- Turn around.
- I should have never
listened to you, Mitchell.
Look at the mess you got us in.
- Oh shut up.
Ain't nobody made

with all the brains.
- Use your head, punk, huh?
- Shit.
