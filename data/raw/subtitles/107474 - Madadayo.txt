"MADADA YO"
He's coming.
Attention.
Bow.
Be seated.
Someone's been smoking.
No smoking in the classroom.
Still...
it is difficult
to resist the urge.
I, too, am no exception.
When I hear the bell in the
faculty room, I try to leave...
but then
I get the urge to smoke.
I light a cigarette.
Soon I light another,
then another.
So you see, I am always
20 or 30 minutes late.
But, Professor,
what's with you today?
It is already 30 odd years...
since I've been addressed
as "Professor."
During that time...
as if watching water running
from an open faucet...
onto a dirt floor
and into a ditch...
students have drifted away
in front of my eyes.
It is impossible to remember
each and every face.
Ah, yes.
There is one among them,
though...
that I remember clearly
to this day.
The face belongs to one...
who slept during class
with his eyes open.
Hey, Takayama.
That dozing expert
was your father.
By the way, gentlemen.
Today is the last day for me
to be called "Professor."
As of today...
I am resigning my professorship.
My books...
have somehow become salable.
I can live by writing.
I must admit
I do not dislike teaching...
but as the proverb...
"He who runs after two hares
will catch neither"...
I have decided to quit teaching.
Professor.
Even if you quit...
you are our professor.
My father, too,
was an alumnus of this school.
So were his friends.
Even to this day,
they call you Professor.
They also say
you are solid gold.
Solid gold?
A lump of gold
with no impurities.
It means
you are the true professor.
You are the German professor,
but you have taught us more.
I feel you have taught us
many precious things.
TOKYO, 1943
This is the house
our professor moved into...
after he quit school.
Ma'am, put the professor
away somewhere.
He's in the way.
Darling.
Put that in the entrance hall.
The entrance hall
will be my study.
At the same time,
I will be the gatekeeper...
to protect the house
from invasion...
by a motley crowd like you.
RECEIVING DA YS...
1ST AND 15TH OF THE MONTH
VISITORS ON OTHER DA YS
PROHIBITED
I hope it is all right.
What is?
This house. The rent
is cheaper than I expected.
I knewthere was
something fishy.
When I went to order noodles
today, the shop lady told me...
this house has been burglarized
quite frequently.
So none have settled down
very long.
And it was vacant for a while.
The heck with burglars.
There's nothing
worth stealing here.
Still... I'm somehow scared.
Don't worry.
No burglar will break in.
Definitely won't.
Since I was a child...
I've been so afraid of burglars.
I've given much thought
on howto prevent burglars.
And I have hammered out
a method to prevent them.
Did you really, Professor?
Yes, I did.
One o'clock.
Bewitching hour.
Hour for the burglars.
I'll go over this wall
and open the side door.
Sneak in here.
Wait a minute.
Aren't we acting like burglars?
We became worried about
what madam told us.
We're here to examine
the precautionary measures.
The only way to check is
to sneak in like real burglars.
Take a look at that.
What a plight!
"Don't worry," he said.
Didn't he boast on being
an expert on burglars?
BURGLAR'S ENTRANCE
BURGLAR'S PASSAGE
BURGLAR'S RECESS AREA
BURGLAR'S EXIT
That was a clean score.
I had to steal this to get even.
Isn't that the professor's hat?
I heard he wore this when he was
an instructor in the army.
He shouldn't need this anymore.
As a reminder of this day...
I'll make this
a family treasure.
What'll we do
about the side door?
What about it?
It's unlocked.
It has to be locked.
You'd better go over the wall.
It's unsafe.
You're right.
Come down.
Come down.
- What is it?
- Someone's coming.
Darn it! It's a cop!
Can we leave
the side door like that?
Sure. With those signs,
nothing will be stolen.
Our professor is something.
Yes, he's solid gold.
Professor!
We have happily come upon
receiving your invitation.
Come right on in.
We can't with you sitting there.
You look like a scribe
or a fortune-teller.
Literary men somewhat
are the same.
This must be a defense measure
to keep away the visitors.
Besides, who wants to stay if
he's reading this kind of thing?
BY SHOKUSANJIN (Haiku Poet)
"Annoyance is to have visitors.
"Nonetheless,
this does not imply you.
"By the host.
"Delight is to have visitors.
"Nonetheless,
this does not imply you."
Hello.
- Come in.
- Hello.
Thank you.
Is it right?
There aren't enough cushions...
so I'll be the one to use it.
I think
that's rude to the guests.
But, oh, well.
What do you mean rude?
You barge into my house,
remove all the sliding doors...
Fine guests you are.
Professor,
it's not a visiting day.
What's happening today?
It's a special day today.
A special day?
It's the day I have become
a genuine old man.
It is my 60th birthday.
I have become 60 years old.
Is that true?
If we had known that...
we would have invited you
to a great banquet.
Come, come. Don't say that.
It's wartime now. Not a time
for a grand celebration.
I myself
had completely forgotten...
if not for some venison
my relatives back home sent me.
I thought it was a good idea...
to exchange drinks with you
over some venison.
We brought beer and sake
we've gathered.
I appreciate that.
By the way,
how many of you are here?
There are 16, sir.
Do we have enough
cooking stoves and pans?
If we don't, we'll go buy some.
Gentlemen.
Happy birthday, sir.
Make yourselves at home.
I sit this way because
it is comfortable for me.
Please put the meat in?
Ma'am. Ma'am, join us.
Don't worry. She can't...
she's never eaten horse meat.
Horse meat, sir?
Isn't this venison?
We received a bulk of venison...
more than we two can eat.
So I decided to invite you.
But considering your appetite...
I realized
it was a slender bulk.
Venison stew
is rare and grand...
but adding horse meat should
make an interesting blend.
"Horse" and "deer" mean stupid.
I get it, sir.
This means we are stupid.
No need to be depressed.
Beef, pork, and chicken
are hard to come by nowadays.
I happened to hear
horse meat was available.
I struck upon the elegance...
of adding horse meat
to the venison stew.
I set out to a butcher's
quite a distance from here...
and bought the horse meat.
Should bring tears to your eyes.
For his loving students...
an old man whipping
his old bones to buy horse meat.
Can you imagine that?
It's a typical,
"Looking up to our teacher...
"thinking of our debt
to our teacher."
Gentlemen!
What is more, I found myself...
in an awkward situation
at the butcher's.
The horse was...
a familiar military horse
at the Army Academy...
where I taught for some time.
It stared at me with
dubious eyes, as if saying...
"What in the world
are you buying there, sir?"
I was so embarrassed.
I wanted to hide somewhere.
By the way, gentlemen...
I never realized
horses had such large eyes.
Well, let's eat.
The meat should be ready.
You certainly make it easy
for us to eat...
with that story of yours,
Professor.
Imagine it's all venison.
Besides,
the two meats are mixed.
You wouldn't know
which is which.
Bon appetit!
It's good.
It is.
It's certainly delicious.
If there is an air raid...
this "stupid stew"
will turn into "blind stew."
I hate air raids.
I have to turn off the lights.
I've been afraid of the dark
since I was a child.
I can't sleep in the dark,
either.
Even now, sir?
Aren't you afraid of the dark?
Of course not.
We're grownups.
What's so scary about darkness?
You gentlemen are impossible.
Why is that?
Anyone unafraid of darkness...
has a vital defect
as a human being.
You lack imagination.
A proper human being...
conceives the existence
of something...
in their imagination in darkness
which prevents you from seeing.
Whatever is in the dark...
it may be of danger to you.
That's why we become scared.
This is justified logic.
In my case...
if I hear
there are badgers here...
everyone in the neighborhood
seems like badgers.
Rather, I suspect...
the badgers have disguised
themselves as humans.
This is only natural
for a proper human being.
It may be natural for you...
because you are solid gold.
To the solid gold professor!
Cheers!
Looking up to our teacher
Thinking of our debt
to our teacher
Over the garden of teaching
Countless years
have already passed
So lost is the passage of time
The years and the months...
Our professor's house...
was also burned down
from the air raids.
This is the professor's house
after that.
All won't go in.
Thanks for coming.
My, my.
OK here?
- Over here.
- Ma'am.
Professor should love this.
Indeed, like rain in drought.
Thank you
for your consideration.
Can I put the bag there?
Oh, that goes...
- Are you coming in?
- I'll help.
There are too many people.
- Are you all right?
- I can't budge.
I now know how
canned sardines feel.
- Anything to put over here?
- This, please.
- Please. Yes, thank you.
- This, too.
Watch your head.
Ignore that head.
Would you take this, too?
Ma'am, if you need anything,
please tell us.
Thank you very much, everyone.
We trouble you all the time.
Don't mention it.
I want an umbrella.
Take this one, sir.
Our bathroom is...
that new building over there.
It doesn't have a roof.
Therefore,
on rainy days such as today...
we can't use it.
What do you say, guys?
To be honest,
this place is terrible.
Let's find someplace else.
No, no.
Coming across this house...
which miraculously survived
was mere luck.
Besides, the owner is a baron
I'm acquainted with.
- A baron?
- Peerage.
Lived in this house?
Don't talk nonsense.
This was...
the shack for
the baron's old garden keeper.
On the morning
when both the baron's house...
and ours were burnt down...
I met the baron who came
to look around his estate.
My wife and I found this shack
and were resting here.
I asked him if we could rent it.
He said, "Please, go ahead."
We were very lucky, indeed.
You knowthis, don't you?
HOJO-KI
Yes, sir.
Books are heavy.
I fled with only this book,
my favorite.
The author of this book,
Kamono Chomei...
lived in the capital
during the Heian Era.
He experienced
many calamities...
such as war, fire, and famine.
Losing all hope in life...
he secluded himself
in a mountain hermitage.
I recently feel the same way...
as Kamono Chomei must have felt.
For the time being,
I intend to settle down here...
which resembles
the hermitage he lived in.
Well, gentlemen,
I wish I can invite you in...
but I'm afraid I can't.
It's packed
with my wife and I alone.
Don't worry.
Professor. Please.
Many of the birds we kept
were burnt.
My wife insisted on
freeing them from the cages...
if we couldn't take them.
A bird freed
from its cage at night...
would only fly into the fire.
If they are
going to be burnt anyway...
they might as well meet their
fate in their familiar cages.
We left them.
A neighborhood child...
found this silver-eye
and gave it to us.
It must have
fallen out of its nest.
It was just a tiny fledgling
at first.
Since she raised it
from that time...
my wife strongly insisted...
and didn't let the cage go.
We had no choice
but to flee with only this.
The only resemblance...
this has with
the hermitage in "Hojo-ki"...
is its smallness,
but without the elegance.
There is no sound of clear water
from the mountains...
running from bamboo pipes
as at Chomei's hermitage.
The only sound of water here...
is that of someone
urinating against the clay wall.
I wonder why
people take the trouble...
of always urinating
in the same place.
They all do it there.
The "Urinating Forbidden" sign
has no effect.
Even a picture of a shrine
seems insufficient.
But I came up
with a brilliant idea.
I painted a special incantation.
I'm sure it works this time.
Go take a look at it.
It's on the other side.
It's ingenious.
URINATING FORBIDDEN
Clever indeed.
Can't afford to get it
chopped off.
He's certainly a genius
for such things.
The rainy season may end.
By the way,
how is the professor?
Where's the professor?
You see how it is.
He's hopeless
once it begins to rumble.
That's why I must keep ready
this incense against thunder.
It may not be proper
to say this...
after all you've done, but...
human beings accumulate so many
things during their life.
The burden lightened...
with everything burnt
in the air raid.
But things have increased
in this house again.
I sometimes hope the B-29
will come pay us a visit.
Still, we're glad
the war is over.
Are you sure?
Since the war,
life has become worse.
During the war,
we at least had food rations.
Without rations...
we are reduced
to live like beggars.
Long ago,
when I was a small child...
we used to make a hut
with bamboo and straw...
in the open lot
behind our house.
I took delight in sitting in it.
When my grandmother
caught me there...
she shed tears and said...
"What in the world
is this boy doing?
"He will surely grow up
to be a beggar."
She wept like a child.
Indeed, my grandmother's
prophecy came true.
Professor!
What are you saying?
You fancy yourself as Chomei?
Did you forget his spirit?
It's not like you.
"The river runs on and on
and the water is never the same.
"Bubbles floating on stagnant
water disappear and form...
"They never remain forever.
"In this world, one's habitat...
"has come to pass as thus."
I see.
Think it no more than
an old man's grumbling.
Let me apologize.
We are here
about that matter, sir.
We can't have you
living here forever.
We plan to build a house
for you somewhere.
Nonsense. I won't let you.
Not immediately, sir.
By the first Maadha Kai
next year...
we'll have a concrete plan.
What is this? This Maadha Kai?
The name of your birthday.
We've decided on that since
it's not likely you'd die soon.
Mouii Kai? (ready?)
Madadayo. (not yet)
Maadha Kai? (not yet?)
"Maadha Kai" as in this.
The characters are
Ma from "a god's name"...
and A and Da
from "the Buddha."
Isn't that a great name?
Is that right?
Maadha Kai? (not yet?)
Maadha Kai?
I'm back.
It's a genuine
Johnny Walker bottle...
but the content is different.
It's medical alcohol.
I got it from a doctor I know.
He made it by mixing tea
and brown sugar.
The taste is questionable,
but it's effective.
I must say,
I'm beginning to feel good.
Professor.
When we were students,
we often drank with you.
When we got drunk,
you led us to a lot of mischief.
We switched nameplates
on houses.
When you sobered up, you'd
make us put them back again.
So sorry, sir.
Professor.
Do you want your new house
Japanese or Western style?
As I already said,
I won't let you.
Leave it to us, Professor.
Nowthat the war is over,
major publishers are reopening.
One of them has offered to pay
in advance for the right...
to publish your works.
Leave it to us.
There is a piece of land
we are considering now.
We can build a small garden.
What kind would you like?
I'd like to have a pond.
A pond?
A garden pond?
There won't be space
for a big pond...
but a small one
will be possible.
I don't want such a small one.
I'd like to keep some fish...
but fish swim
in the same direction.
If the pond is so small...
they'd have to
bend their bodies all the time.
It'll be pathetic
if their backs get bent.
Fish's backs?
What about this idea?
The whole garden is a pond.
That's a lot
of construction work.
Then...
make the pond circumference
as large as possible.
Build an island in the middle.
Make a doughnut-shaped pond.
You come up with
the weirdest ideas.
You're beyond us mediocre men.
He seriously worries
about fish's backs.
I must say, he's a genius.
He's a child. He never grows up.
I got it.
That's what turns you on.
Don't be silly.
Don't hide it.
I realize...
that's what we like in him, too.
That's why it's fun
to be with him.
Isn't that right?
The moon is out.
The moon is out, the moon is out
Round, round, perfectly round
I love old songs.
Like Henri Rousseau's
paintings...
so innocent and honest.
I love songs
of the good ol' days.
During the war...
we had forgotten about
such nice things like the moon.
The moon is out, the moon is out
Round, round, perfectly round
The moon is like a tray
"The houses demolished
under frequent fires...
"are incalculable.
"Alone the trivial hermitage
remains tranquil...
"without dread.
"Though small and poor...
"it offers a bed at night...
"and a seat in the day.
"What more can one ask for
in a shelter?"
THE FIRST MAADHA KAI
To celebrate
our professor's 61st birthday...
we will open
the first Maadha Kai party.
Under the Allied Occupation...
food and alcohol
are not easy to come by.
Luckily, with the cooperation
of all the members...
we were able to hold
this banquet.
As the chairman...
let me voice our appreciation...
to the officers
who have done so well.
Words from our professor...
and a large glass of beer.
Please drink up in one breath.
Then a toast in his honor.
My friends and gentlemen.
Thank you all for inviting me
here tonight.
Thank you for sparing time...
though some are not busy...
from your busy schedule...
to attend
this wonderful gathering.
"Is this old goat still alive?"
Seems to be the motive of...
the Maadha Kai
and that you all have...
the desire to ask me
Maadha Kai (not yet?)...
I have come to say Madadayo
(not yet).
Though it may be against
the principles...
of this meeting, ask me again
next year and the year after.
Please ask me Maadha Kai.
I promise
that I will someday...
respond to you by saying
Mouiiyo (I'm ready).
I assure you I am well-prepared.
The person to my right...
has taken care of me for years.
He is my physician,
Dr. Kobayashi.
He will sign
my death certificate.
The gentleman on my left...
is one of the alumni.
He took over
his family business...
and is now a priest at a temple.
Rev. Kameyama will...
perform the final ritual
before I die.
In any case...
I am about to empty this large
glass of beer in one breath...
and even if I die on the spot...
there is nothing to worry about.
Madadayo! (not yet)
Cheers!
Congratulations.
Gentlemen,
while you are still free...
from the effects
of the liquor...
a short speech
from the each of you.
Make them short and simple.
Long live the professor!
That was too short.
It's felicitating.
A long one'll be a condolence.
I am deeply grateful
to the professor.
When we staged the opera "Faust"
in German under his guidance...
I was given a wonderful role.
I will always treasure
that memory of sensation.
Did you play Mephistopheles?
No, sir.
I played the eternal virgin
Faust fell in love with...
Margarita.
I'm awkward with speeches, so...
I'll recite all the station
names from Hokkaido to Kyushu.
Express trains?
No, for the locals.
That'll be something.
Kushiro, Shin-Fuji, Ohtanoshige,
Shoro, Shiranuka, Onbetsu...
Let's forget him. Next.
I don't understand
why today is an auspicious day.
Probably because Professor
is still alive.
I'm alive, too, but there's...
I don't think it's auspicious.
Say, Your Holiness!
You embarrass me.
Then, Eminence!
High Priest!
That, too.
Then, Priest!
That's better.
How's your business?
Are you busy?
Quite busy, thank you.
That's why I don't want you
to come yet.
Then I shall have to wait.
By the way, Mr. Quack.
Candidly speaking...
How long would you say
can I hold out?
Let me see.
Granted you keep to my advice...
I'll guarantee another
15-16 years.
That's bad.
If he lives so long,
we officers will be accused.
Drink up, Professor.
Professor.
You're a juyaku (executive),
aren't you?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Have you ever thought
of the word "executive"?
Not particularly, sir.
That's the trouble.
Comes from "execute"...
"enforce," "discharge"...
even "behead."
You mustn't be vain just because
you became an executive.
Such a person is not worthy.
Must be executed.
Have mercy on me, sir.
Nowthat my turn has come...
I would like to...
I owe it all to Professor...
Thank you, Professor.
Professor, you have taught us
the joy of drinking.
But some only got drunk
and had given you trouble.
Sugino went wild
swinging beer bottles.
When Kitamura got drunk,
he'd hug and kiss anyone.
Even kissed me.
Shaved off your beard?
Yes, I did.
Mustn't do such a thing...
without telling us.
Why, sir?
The beard was a part
of your face for many years.
We all recognized you...
because of that beard.
Now it's gone...
I didn't recognize you at first.
Granted, the beard was yours,
but...
it was also ours, so...
mustn't shave it off
on your own.
Sorry, I'll grow it again.
That won't do.
If you grow it again...
we won't recognize you.
As you all know...
Professor is indeed well-read.
One time...
he told us
not to take for granted...
that ears are attached
to the head.
Because Ampriobiris Spirias
has ears on its feet.
What?
What's Ampriobirisus Spirias?
What is that?
It's Ampriobiris Spirias.
Please, sir.
Gentlemen.
Don't crowd me like this.
I can't cope with you all
by myself.
Let's toast once again...
and we all enjoy the occasion
as we like.
Gentlemen, thank you.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Drinking parties
are interesting.
At one time, all the members
become intoxicated.
It somehow reminds me of water
in a pot coming to a boil.
That is why...
I still feel I am his student.
Be quiet, please.
Tada, your turn.
The professor is great.
That's right.
Not that professors are great...
but a great man
became a professor.
Professor is like the sun to us.
Overstatement.
That would be an exaggeration...
so I'll say he's like the moon.
Overstatement.
Wait.
There are half moons.
Or one-third moons.
Or at times no moons.
Like Professor's lessons.
This is why I compare him
to the moon.
The moon is great
The moon is the sun's sister
The moon turns
into a perfect circle
The moon turns into a bow
Spring, summer, autumn, winter
She shines over entire Japan
The moon is out, the moon is out
Round, round, perfectly round
The moon is like a tray
The moon is hiding, hiding
Behind black, black, jet black
Clouds like black ink
The moon is out once again
Round, round, perfectly round
The moon is like a tray
Gentlemen.
Remember...
"One-two Mr. Pharmacist."
Let's do that.
One-two Medicine
is the best in Japan
One, two
Buy One-two Medicine
One, two, one, two
The medicine cures...
One, two
Pyrosis, stomach trouble,
diarrhea
Dizziness before
and after childbirth
Asthma, headache, influenza
From here, is my original.
Take the pace.
Medicine can cure
numerous illnesses
But no medicine can cure a fool
Foolishness is in heaps today
Japan is blooming with fools now
Suffer defeat,
held under occupation
But fools call it
the end of the war
Right about!
Advocating democracy
loud and clear
Only crooks throw
their weight about
Bribery and corruption
currently pass with impunity
Brazen fair and square
Scandals, paradise,
a doodlebug trap
Those haughty fools never learn
Chirp and twitter all in unison
Chirp, chirp, twitter, twitter
The end.
Ljuin, Manjishi,
Nishi-Kagoshima, Kagoshima...
We've arrived!
What? Where is everybody?
Don't know.
Have some more.
Could that be me?
It seems like it.
Maadha Kai? (not yet?)
Maadha Kai?
Madadayo! (not yet)
Maadha Kai?
Madadayo!
Maadha Kai?
Madadayo!
Maadha Kai?
Madadayo!
Professor's new house
was completed.
Only this pair for men.
The rest are for women.
My beautiful garden
is not that spacious.
You'll manage with them.
To make the pond, the house
had to be squeezed down.
When you think of
that matchbox house...
this is indeed
as big as a palace.
Right?
Indeed it is.
We're flattered.
Still, I do flatter myself
with this doughnut-shaped pond.
It's a brilliant idea.
The Pacific may be vast...
but swimming straight...
you'll reach
the shores of America.
Swimming round in this pond...
the distance is limitless.
I want to keep carp
in this pond.
Big ones you only see in dreams.
They could be
as big as rowboats.
That's impossible.
Infinite this pond may be...
they'll curl up
and end up motionless.
Bad for their backs.
I meant it
as a figure of speech.
Like in the expression...
"gray hair 3,000-yard long"
in a Chinese poem.
Imagine a carp
the size of a whale.
By the way...
The Golden Pavilion is
built in a pond, and my house...
although small and...
and not sparkling,
is quite like it.
So put this up.
KINKAKUJI (guests forbidden]
This Golden Pavilion...
forbids such boisterous crowds
like us.
I'll use it as my study,
so I won't allow any guests.
What do you think?
Isn't this lot too small?
Could be worked out
with the plan.
It's 49.5.
LAND FOR SALE
It's 53.5.
Tea is ready.
Yes, ma'am.
Please.
The man who greeted you,
who is he?
The owner of that lot.
He came the other day
to ask me if I'd buy that lot.
I don't have so much money.
I have to refuse, but...
he was very courteous.
Approaching me so politely,
I find it hard to tell him.
Seems he found a buyer.
Yes, I'm glad.
Are you keeping that cat?
I call it Nora, because
it's a nora neko (alley cat).
My wife gave it dried fish,
and it's lived here.
Besides,
it has good physiognomy.
Cat physiognomy? Sounds odd.
How else can I say it?
But it does sound rather odd.
Anyway,
this cat is well-cultured.
Better mannered than you.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Be good.
It's the man from next door.
He wants to pay his respects
to you.
Excuse me.
What?
That's why I came
to pay him my respect.
- But...
- Rot the "buts."
I bought the land.
It's my land now.
I can build whatever I like.
That's true, but...
you must think about
your neighbor.
Building a three-story house...
next to their fence
is unreasonable.
Unreasonable?
The surveying proved the lot
is smaller.
Another floor must be added to
the two-story house I planned.
If you do that, you'll be...
depriving them of the sun.
So what?
That's none of my concern.
Please wait.
The negotiation is closed.
Please wait.
I've changed my mind.
What?
I'm not selling.
Don't be ridiculous!
Nowthat the contract is made,
the land is mine.
I haven't signed it yet.
It's still my land.
I absolutely will not
sell that land to you.
Excuse me.
I'm grateful to you for being
so considerate about us.
I can't thank you enough.
But wouldn't it put you...
in a bad spot?
As for my house, even though
there's no sunlight...
If that's the case...
But what...
- Let's do it.
- Shall we?
Let's go ask the landowner.
Professor, I must say
this cat has good qualities.
The cat was angry
at that blockhead.
But that landowner
seems to be a good man.
Where does he live?
He lives in a shack
at the base of that lot.
We must be leaving.
Stay a bit longer.
I'm still upset.
Let's drink.
I've prepared some food and...
Sorry, ma'am.
I must go.
So must I.
Good-bye.
NANZANJU
Professor, what does
this Nanzanju mean?
Long life of Nanzan.
An expression wishing long life.
Should be read Nanzansu.
I hung it up, because I am
reluctant to talk to visitors.
Nanzansu is "Whaddya want"
at the brothel.
The courtesan used this
expression during the Edo Era.
Of course,
it's short for nan-zamasu.
It's perfect for that blockhead.
Right.
Nanzansu indeed.
My God, he's annoying.
I detest that dear man.
Good-bye, sir.
Good-bye.
See you.
Something strange is cooking up.
Why did they hurry off
like that?
Good baby, good baby, dear Nora.
Let me hold him, too.
Hey, let me.
Come on.
If you consent to it...
Thank you.
I can buy a small house
with this...
and send for my family.
I don't know howto thank you.
You can thank our professor.
He truly is grateful to you.
We understand how he feels.
So...
If he finds out about this deal,
it'll be awkward.
I know.
Please,
keep this a secret from him.
He'll know in time...
but leave the lot
as it is until then.
You all...
are such nice people.
You're a nice person yourself.
But the nicest one
is our professor.
We try as best to imitate him.
Good-bye.
That was good.
By the way...
Nanzansu? (What, dear?)
Let's drink.
Where shall we go?
To the professor's.
Great idea.
That's a charming idea.
Professor's in trouble.
What's wrong?
He isn't sick.
The cat disappeared.
Madam called me.
Wants us to come.
Professor hasn't stopped crying
since the cat disappeared.
Dear...
Please.
I received a call from Madam.
Are you all right?
Of course, I am.
Nothing more than a cat.
I'm all right.
Besides
this isn't the first time.
Nora has disappeared before.
He'll come back.
Thank you for coming.
I'd be grateful, if you could
spare time to eat with us.
You'd do me a favor
if you could.
Since Nora disappeared,
he's eaten almost nothing.
You may think I'm stupid.
No...
To be honest... I am stupid.
I'm totally hopeless.
Since Nora disappeared...
I can think of nothing else.
I can't do anything.
I only think about Nora.
Do you see that willowtree?
Nora...
came through an opening
in the fence there.
Since then he became
a member of this household.
Since Nora disappeared...
I can't help...
Iooking at that hole.
Nora might be coming through
the opening in the fence again.
I want to see it.
The other day...
I went to Kyushu
to give a lecture.
On the way back...
Through the window,
in the dark station...
I saw Nora.
It may sound strange, but...
I really did see Nora.
I saw him clearly.
Something bothered me.
When I reached Tokyo Station...
I called my house.
As I thought...
That day... after nightfall...
Nora wanted to go out.
I picked him up and said:
"Stay home, it's late."
He wanted to go out...
so I took him outside.
Nora grew impatient and...
wiggled until he
slipped out of my arms.
He went through the opening.
After a while...
it began to rain.
And later it began to pour.
Nora probably couldn't return
in that rain.
On the bathtub cover...
is Nora's bed.
My husband sometimes goes there.
Looks at the cushion.
He caresses it dearly and weeps.
I... I really don't know
what to do.
Professor.
I'm ashamed to show
my miserable face.
I may be...
sentimental...
or overreaching or weak-willed
or whatever...
I just can't help it.
I try to forget...
but keep remembering Nora.
Then I feel so much pain.
I can't bear it.
Professor, we'll find Nora.
We'll organize a search party
to find Nora.
So please, Professor...
That's a dog.
We promised
we would find Nora, but...
We should try searching places
saved from fire.
Why should Professor
suffer so much?
Our professor is very special.
He's not you or me.
His sensitivity and imagination
are beyond us.
When he thinks of Nora...
he can picture every detail.
That's why he suffers.
Can't just sit and watch.
You're right. Let's try.
DEAR NORA
This is our professor's diary...
which he wrote about Nora
with affection.
Here.
There are cats everywhere,
hundreds around.
But it simply
has to be this cat.
How come?
Do you have a brother?
Sure, I do. He's still a baby.
If your brother is switched
with some other baby...
That's terrible.
This cat is my baby.
I care for him like my child.
That's why
it has to be this cat.
Tell me if you find him.
What it looks like
is written here...
and the address is here, too.
Children.
Please find a cat named Nora.
This cat seems to be
around here somewhere.
It's a male cat
with a brown and white coat.
His tail is thick and twisted.
If you touch it, you'll know.
If you call out "Nora"...
he will prick up his ears
and stare at you.
A reward will be given
to whoever finds him.
Please help us.
Yes.
Since then,
we received many phone calls...
that they have seen a cat
like Nora.
But...
Professor isn't eating much.
I know.
He eats and drinks very little.
I can't sleep much, either.
That's terrible.
Since Nora disappeared,
he hasn't taken a bath.
Nora's cushion
is on the bathtub cover.
I must use
the public bath far away.
Is it rain?
I used to love
the sound of rain.
Not anymore.
When I think of Nora,
it pains me.
How about making flyers
to insert in newspapers?
I'll take them
to the newspaper distributors.
That's a good idea.
I never thought of it.
What a fool I am.
I really am.
Thinking of Nora's return,
I wrote this announcement.
"L"...meaning Nora...
"I have been away
for some time...
"and I have worried
my master terribly...
"and given you a lot of trouble.
"I have safely returned,
so please put your mind at rest.
"Seeing my face,
my master burst into tears.
"I write this letter
in his place.
"To celebrate my return...
"my master wishes
to invite you all to a drink.
"Please feel free to..."
Waiting for Nora's return,
Professor prepared a collar...
with their address
engraved on it.
But Nora still hasn't returned.
I received a letter saying
I must wait eight months...
for a stray cat to return.
This person's cat
returned safely...
after eight months.
We've received some calls.
There are strange ones, too.
The other day,
a person asked me if Nora mews.
I said, "Yes."
Then he said,
"Doesn't he bark? Hee hee hee."
And hung up.
Hello.
Yes?
Has your cat returned?
No.
He might have been stolen.
Ma'am, cats often get stolen.
There are cat-catchers.
Catch cats and sell their skin.
The prices aren't bad.
Shamisen uses cat skin.
Your cat could be stolen.
I'll check up on that.
Good day.
Hello.
Dear. Dear.
Dear, they found Nora.
Nora was in such a place?
It's Nora. It's Nora.
Nora!
Dear Nora!
Nora's friend,
the fishmonger's wife, says so.
Must be true.
Thank you.
Thank you.
My wife will go. I thank you.
Hello. Takayama?
They found Nora.
Yes, that's right.
It's positive.
Can you tell the others?
I saw a wonderful dream.
I dreamt of feeding Nora.
Nora will return.
I was going to tell you...
and I brought
Nora's favorite fish.
Professor, congratulations.
From my boss.
Thank you indeed.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Cats do return.
They were wrong.
It wasn't Nora.
I'll get it.
Yes?
That's right.
Who the hell are you?
I'll smack your face!
What's up?
Damn!
"Nora's gone.
Already a Shamisen."
Saying so,
he sounded the Shamisen.
Come here. Come here.
Come here.
This was intended for Nora,
but it's yours now.
Go on, eat it.
Is it good?
Like Nora,
you seem to like baby mackerels.
That's a good cat.
Professor seems
to have recovered.
Madam called. The cat.
Found Nora?
Relax. It's not Nora.
That black and white,
black on white...
white on black...
You relax. Calm down.
- Give me water.
- Here's some.
That's why.
"That's why" what? Calm down.
What's this black and white cat?
Oh, yes. Remember that cat?
The one madam was feeding?
It's there to stay.
Professor now picks it up.
Kurz. Kurz.
What's this "Kurz"?
Did you forget
that simple German word?
"Kurz."
It means "short" in German.
Has a short tail.
- What tail?
- The cat's tail!
That black and white cat
has a short tail...
so Professor named it Kurz.
Even named it. She said he's OK.
I'm glad to hear that.
She wants us all
to come tonight.
I'll fetch Kiriyama.
You fetch Sawamura.
- Phone them.
- Yes, the phone.
The phone's here.
Relax.
Kuru, Kuru.
You're a good baby.
Leave it to my wife,
and Kurz becomes Kuru.
Kuru's not bad.
It's easy to pronounce.
Easy to pronounce.
Leave it be at that.
I really went to pieces
over Nora...
and troubled you all.
Because of that,
I caused you so much trouble.
I'm sorry.
Where's Kurz?
Sleeping in Nora's bed.
I am so given to peevishness.
And linger in regrets.
Can you believe that?
I still do that.
Not mosquito repellent.
Incantation
to bring back missing cats.
I still do such a thing.
I'm disgusted at myself.
But I'm all right now.
I've always been
the hare in the myth...
saved by the Harvest God.
Don't you all know...
There was a white hare in Inaba
Rawfresh with skin peeled off
...this song?
Yes, I remember.
Carrying a large bag
over his shoulder
Who can the Harvest God be?
That's the fourth verse.
This song has many verses.
It's about an injured hare
saved by the Harvest God.
I am that hare.
And...
Who can the Harvest God be?
It is no other than you all.
As far as Nora is concerned...
people who sent me
kind letters...
people who called me...
all those who worried
for Nora with me...
the Harvest God is those people.
Carrying a large bag
over his shoulder
The Harvest God's
large bag is...
full of your kindness.
That kindness...
saved me from despair.
Carrying a large bag
over his shoulder
The Harvest God
came around the bend
There he sees
the white hare of Inaba
Rawfresh with skin peeled off
The Harvest God
took pity on the hare
Taught the hare to
Wash itself in clear water
And wrap itself
in reed mace cotton
As the Harvest God taught him
The hare washed itself
in clear water
And wrapped itself
in reed mace cotton
He was once again the white hare
Gentlemen.
Who could the Harvest God be?
Towers in memory
of Nora and Kurz...
were erected
in the professor's garden.
Nora was never found.
Kurz, living a full life,
sleeps here.
And the willowtree
has grown to this height.
THE 17TH MAADHA KAI PARTY
I now remember the time...
when I became 60 years old.
At the time...
I thought I had become
a genuine old man.
But nowthat I have turned 77...
to celebrate
my birthday again...
I realize when I was 60...
I was nothing more
than a young punk.
But now...
I have become a genuine old man.
At one time, you confronted me
with so many Maadha Kai calls...
that in response
I thought of hanging myself...
from the willowtree
in my garden.
So I can say
Mouiiyo (I'm ready) to you.
But, ironically, the willow...
at the time,
was still small and narrow.
It was useless for hanging.
But nowthe willowtree
has grown.
It is good enough for hanging.
But I am still here.
I must ask your forgiveness.
My good friends and gentlemen...
I thank you all
for this occasion.
According to our custom...
I will drink up
this large glass of beer.
The glass has shrunk again.
Is this your idea?
The glass gets
smaller and smaller.
It is no longer a large glass.
Even that is too big
for you now.
Don't complain and drink up.
Madadayo! (not yet)
Let's toast for our professor.
Congratulations.
By this, we finish
the usual Maadha Kai ritual.
We will now hold our professor's
77th birthday celebration.
First, the presentation
of flowers.
They're your students'
daughters.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Next, from the Maadha Kai
members, a birthday cake.
Oh, no.
You'll have candles
to equal my age...
and I must blowthem out.
I can't do it.
Mustn't treat an old man
so cruelly.
But, Professor, since
we can't have 77 candles...
only seven candles.
Even seven candles
may be a burden.
Some of my teeth are missing.
Much of the air leaks out.
These children?
They're their grandchildren.
Look how lovely they are.
I feel like eating them.
I want to give the cake
to the children who brought it.
Come here, children.
With this cake,
there is something...
I want to give you.
Let me say this.
Please find something
you really like.
Find something that
you'd be able to treasure.
When you find it...
work very hard
for your treasure.
At that time,
you will have the treasure...
you must work hard for.
And it will become a career
you put your heart into.
That is your real treasure.
Too difficult perhaps.
I'm sorry.
Take it.
Thank you.
Later.
Now, all you grandpas
and grandmas...
dads and moms...
let's drink
and have a good time.
Professor.
Let's do "One-two" again.
As you say...
there are so many irritating
things in the world recently.
Graft, bribery are at large
One, two
Let's go out dancing.
Professor!
Professor!
As the professor's
family doctor...
I must say
there is nothing to worry about.
It is just one of his chronic
irregular pulse fits.
I suggest he goes home
and rests for a while.
I'm all right.
Don't worry.
Madadayo. (not yet)
We officers will escort
Professor to his house.
Don't worry, and continue
the party for his sake.
Professor.
Professor.
My husband's cane.
You look so nonchalant.
Damn monk.
Don't worry.
He's not ready for me yet.
All right.
Thank you.
Looking up to our teacher
Thinking of our debt
to our teacher
Over the garden of teaching
Countless years
have already passed
So fast is the passage of time
The years and the months...
Nothing to worry.
If he rests well tonight,
he'll be fine.
I'm worried about those guys.
They may cause trouble.
Don't wake the professor
and drink again.
You're joking.
We'll hit the sack.
Don't wet the bed.
That quack.
Mattresses are in there.
Shall I...
We'll do it, ma'am.
There may not be enough.
I hope it won't be cold.
No worry... if we have a drink.
That's good enough.
But...
Like our student days.
Remember his speech?
We'll soon be
genuine old men, too.
There's nothing.
Thank you, ma'am.
I'll sleep in the Kinkakuji.
If anything...
Don't worry. It's OK.
You mustn't wake Professor.
Yes, ma'am.
- Good night.
- Good night.
It's great.
What is?
When we used to stay over...
he made us prepare
for the lessons.
That was a real pain.
No need for that tonight...
nor go to school tomorrow.
We've passed all that.
Madadayo. (not yet)
He's sound asleep.
He must be dreaming.
I wonder
what kind of dreams he sees.
His dreams must be
solid gold, too.
Maadha Kai? (ready?)
Madadayo! (not yet)
Maadha Kai?
Madadayo!
Maadha Kai?
Madadayo.
Maadha Kai?
Madadayo.
