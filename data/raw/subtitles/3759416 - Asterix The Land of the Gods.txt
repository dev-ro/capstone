Senators, I tell you.
Those who escaped the claws of the lion
will be poisoned by the venom of the snake.
There are too many critters.
- It's not literally.
- What?
O Caesar... what do you mean
by "snake venom"?
- And by "the claws of the lion"?
- I get it.
Lion! The invincible power of Rome!
Like greenhouses falcon, it has closed...
- There is a falcon?
- Shh!
As the greenhouses of the hawk,
it is closed on all continents,
except here in Brittany,
where a handful
of indomitable Gauls still
laugh beak The Imperial Eagle.
The Imperial Eagle, it is a problem
to someone?
These barbarians refuse Rome?
So it is Rome that will go to them.
Uh... That's it? It is now?
Yes now.
This is the venom of the snake.
Their forests give way
to glorious buildings.
Surrounded by the Roman civilization,
they will have to adapt or disappear.
I entrusted the construction
our beautiful city the
young architect Anglaigus.
He designed many buildings
many of which do not collapse.
Congratulations Anglaigus! I adore.
Beautiful little model!
How do you call him your glorious city?
I thought... It was so bad.
So I have not insisted.
What do you suggest, Senator Prospectus?
There should be a name that evokes Rome...
But that is not really Rome.
- Rume?
- Rume?
It's not really Rome.
I fear being confused with...
Good. What are you think...
Domaine gods?
The Domain of the Gods?
I'm not sure...
Oh if, as well, it's not bad.
Cuckoo!
This one's for you, Obelix.
Obviously, I saw the 1st.
- Really?
- Perfectly!
He is afraid of me, not you!
Really? You talked about?
I see the first wild boar.
Is that I flaps under your nose?
- Ah here!
- Môssieur is essential!
You're done, right?
I'm the fastest.
To eat them.
- This is mine!
- I Will Not!
- Yes!
- I Will Not!
Yes!
Obelix!
My boar...
called "back"!
It's not your boar!
What is it, by Toutatis?
121, 122, 123, 124, 125...
Sorry, sorry...
126, 127,
and... 128!
This is the first tree to be felled.
By Vesta! Remove me that!
Lying!
It should not touch the trees, Roman.
Idéfix hates that.
Come on, Dogmatix! Enough is enough!
Get out of here now!
The site is strictly forbidden
to the public. Is that clear?
I like the Romans without armor.
They make a nice sound when they fall.
O Abraracourcix our leader,
we need to talk to you!
He is in a meeting. Can I take a message?
I'm listening.
What is happening?
A Fish Story not fresh...
What do you mean not fresh?
I was responding to a question!
Go for it!
We stumbled upon the Romans.
- From the Romans with strings.
- What kind strings?
Where one begins in the feet.
It would be a prohibited public site.
What is this site?
Strings, it's not too serious.
Come On! It returns!
Go watch me this site. You never know.
Hey, we made our report!
He finished your report!
It is intolerable that
mustached barbarians threaten
Caesar plans!
The Gauls do not like
to touch their forest.
Their forest?
Stop moving, please.
By Juno, which they believe is?
They think they are home.
That's the problem.
Well up to civilization.
We will deforest their forest.
Be the first dégauloiser.
For this, Caesar counting on you.
And I believe...
- Ave, Centurion!
- What he has, Slaves
complain of inactivity.
Operations are suspended
for securing the site.
- How To? - How what?
- I understood nothing.
Well, that's okay.
Anglaigus to avoid the Gauls,
we must work at night.
A night site! Anything!
As your bandage!
Centurion! My staff and I are undecided.
Should we draw?
You need to repeat it?
You wait for my signal.
What is your signal, already?
For the 30th time it is when I get the arm.
Very much so.
What are we waiting for, by Jupiter?
What are we waiting for?
The report of my scouts.
Centurion! You make too much
gossip with angry architect.
It's dangerous.
Back in the ranks!
The whip cracks.
The tree crack.
But what you manufacture?
- You raised his arm.
- I Do Not.
Oh yes! So, clack!
I gave the signal.
Ave, Centurion.
- Scouts to the report.
- Where were you?
- There!
- What you light here?
It was not far
because the Gau...
I can not hear. Because?
GAULOIS OF!
Gauls? Humerus sounds the retreat!
Ave, Centurion!
Come back, band of morons!
Ho bah...
Idéfix!
What happens now?
A shot of the Romans.
That, Idéfix. Everything is back in order.
What for those not in the head, again.
- Just Listen.
- One tree per night?
You shove your finger
- in the eye to the ulna.
- Present!
The farm, Ulna! Not just stand there!
Where is the tree ripped yesterday?
I do not have very good news.
It is not torn.
What?
The tree is replanted.
Replanted figuratively?
No, no... Replanted under "replanted".
Look At.
No, but it is not true!
But this is not true!
- Centurion! The architect of fuss again!
- Silence!
Enough is enough! We go!
We can not fight.
- I Will Not! They pull off this tree.
- Yet Again?
Yes I Am. And will report to camp!
Wait... Our function provides
the uprooting of trees,
but their transportation...
You are slaves. You obey
the buckle and you!
Centurion is you who make the fuss!
Shut up! And you, pull!
Fortunately I have not brought Idéfix.
O Druid, what do we do?
I may be a funny tinker...
A funny tinker?
Prodigious! You realize
how fast they grow?
How it grows usual speed?
I have a new not funny.
It may seem daunting.
We must see the good, the motivation
remains intact. It's great!
Nobody gives up. We must
congratulate ourselves.
- Obelix, eat slowly!
- To do what?
- Well, I still have a tassel.
- I Will Not! Obelix...
Obelix! You're going to uproot
me that tree, immediately!
Oh no! I can not do that to Idéfix.
So if I understand you correctly,
not only the site of the Estate
of the Gods does not advance,
but the Romans did not want to live there.
We face some reluctance.
Our citizens are reluctant
to emigrate to Armorica.
If we built the city near
Rome, they would be far less.
Give me a solution incapable!
Or you will end the arena with the lions!
It will entertain citizens,
without taking them
away from home.
The arenas...
That's a great idea, O Caesar!
Ha, naughty! I'll gut you!
Hercules! To me! Help!
It's me, Hercules!
You will pay, nasty Trojan!
You're going to die like a cockroach!
Apeldjus! It has to killings,
massacres, killings?
But let him, he enjoys.
It's crazy so violent!
Where does he get that?
- Attempting a triple outlet?
- Double.
And neck, by the
way, it is better?
I have to avoid sudden movements.
- Ready for the shot of Rattlesnake?
- Ready Now!
I never liked the shot of rattlesnake.
Well, sorry, old man!
Do not rebuke you there three times.
Pshaw here, an ad!
We can no longer do a killing correctly.
Tell me about it!
Romain! Roman!
You've had enough!
Enough of the stinking
atmosphere of the town! Noise!
Frenzy! Traffic!
Well no, not really...
Know a quiet gem awaits you. A new quote,
in a green setting awaits you at least
three weeks from the center of Rome.
The divine Caesar offer tonight
to one of you a
splendid apartment...
Domain of the gods!
Consult the unbendable
located at your feet!
Oh! But it's beautiful!
Yes... but it's in Brittany.
Where is it?
I dunno, but it's far.
The big draw... begin!
The lucky winner...
is...
the holder of the unbendable number...
a couple of!
But... it's you! Bah quickly down!
I want to go to Brittany.
You do not even know where it is.
Who is the lucky number two?
This is us! It's here!
It is this person!
We won what? A gladiator?
Whether cheering loudly,
as it descends into the arena!
Oh! Looks like your father's beautiful!
It looks like a Greek hero.
Well Done!
Well Done!
Mouse! Number and wield your mouse!
Uh... Um... This is where Armorica already?
In Gaul.
Oh yes? It's far anyway.
And if I refuse to leave?
You stay here and cowardly lions.
I Do Not. It's true that a little
fresh air, it can only do good.
Oh yes!
Indeed, Roman architecture
is awfully impressive.
So there is the lobby?
We will stop spending and
you will return to Rome
and explain that the fun is over.
Never Before! You hear?
Caesar gave me a mission.
And I will lead her to the end,
even if I kill the slaves to the task.
"To kill the slaves to the task?"
This is what will happen.
What can we do, Getafix?
Think Through.
I have an idea, but you're going to want.
- A beating?
- That, that was my idea.
To protect the slaves, I have a plan.
It requires a beating, certainly,
but... a little.
A little beating? It is this?
SHL FU MI!
SHL FU MI!
The camp slaves, please?
Hello!
You may not know I'm
in a good mood!
Well, it must be there.
Here is the magic potion that
gives superhuman strength. Gift!
I would taste not before?
No, not you!
It'll just you mutiny
and run. You are free.
First I want to say thank you.
But is the leak a way out?
- Pardon?
- You speak of leakage.
But flight is it not...
I force the feature,
another form of slavery?
It is rather the beginning
of a form of freedom.
Yet no escape oppression.
There are matters to discuss.
I offer just a potion.
I return to the concept...
You take your potion or are you a glue!
Absolutely, absolutely.
What has happened?
A fine example of respect
for our Gallic neighbors.
Oh no, you is not the time!
Ouch...
From now on, we will reach a balance
equal to that of the legionaries.
We want to leave, two
meals a day... How?
- Three.
- Oh yes! So Now,
three meals a day.
- That's it?
- I Do Not.
When the first building of
the city will be built,
we want to be freed.
- Goodfellas?
- Free.
Ah yes, yes. As a result,
it requires each housing.
That's the little extra...
Present!
You're not going to accept?
Though. It seems prudent.
Bargain?
Oh yes! Actually...
Roman architecture is impressive!
It's a good job!
What you do there?
Centurion, according to a rumor that,
you will give the slaves
the same pay as us?
You confirm it's salads?
- This is mine!
- No, mine!
- I Will Not!
- Yes!
What are you doing? The magic potion,
it was to run away.
So we debated it. And condition
of runaway slave does not
offer career prospects.
What do you like more, by Toutatis?
Simply become
free Roman citizens. For that,
we have to finish the building.
We will not let you
destroy our forest. Away your men!
We will return to destroy the site.
- Everyone was served?
- Oul! I Will Not...
A bit of silence for my speech.
COME ON! LET'S GO!
You do not even know about
who you need to type.
- Who cares!
- As long as we tape!
We must destroy a large building.
You break everything that comes along.
It will be fine.
Hold On...
CHAAAAAARGEZ!
Group 44, you follow me!
And 43?
The 43 is the entrance C.
Civilians!
Oh, a little animation
costume to make us wait!
I would have preferred a snack.
John Marcus!
Come on, buddy.
- We can break the big house?
- I Do Not.
- Well, a column, anyway?
- I Do Not.
- The little cart, at least?
- I Will Not!
What for the Romans if
you can not type on it?
Come on, kids! We went home.
I need your title.
But that's my title!
It was given to us by Caesar.
What do you need?
Petirictus... Petiminus.
Petiminus, I can not... Say!
Stop fidgeting or you will not get away.
It's long! It's long, by Vesta!
The mosaic is a long time.
This is not new.
- Your mosaic has a problem.
- Pardon?
- It is too big and not consolidated...
- This is the time?
- She's perfect, Peticitrus.
- Petiminus.
Petiminus. I can not accommodate you.
Thank you. Next!
- It was weeks of travel.
- It's Caesar...
Returns tomorrow with a
complete record. Next!
Go file, I'm busy!
Brittany lost with nowhere to go...
If it falls on the Gallic barbarians?
I Will Not! I hate fighting.
Hercules will flatten you!
Look, he raises his own column!
I have the right to play with the dog?
For sure. It is very good
to bring the sticks.
Hein, Idéfix?
I train to bring the standing
stones, but it's not that.
Come on, Dogmatix, fetch!
- Hercules!
- It was bad luck.
- You said it.
- What is going to fall on us?
Daddy! Mom!
I found Hercules!
Where it Hercules?
- Apeldjus!
- Saving children. Regions that
man to man.
I got you!
About what?
In a general way. You are...
Say, the soup is getting cold!
One minute Mimine. I arrive.
You are very disappointed
to have had a good fight.
We took the magic potion for nothing.
If I meet a Roman civil,
I shall send her a look
that will speak volumes!
Me, if a Roman civil wonder his way,
I will show him, but he will ask no more.
Me, me!
If a Roman helps me carry my
cart, I will say thank you...
but it will not be sincere.
It's buddies... They have nowhere to go.
They do not have the correct folder.
The last time a Roman came, I was not born.
Civilian or not, Romans to
the village, I disagree.
It's starting to look like
a small invasion attempt.
Watch Out! The invaders are...
Where did you see
invaders? This is a lost family.
But... Mimine - A family is a family.
The small to be starved to death.
That's all I see.
Come eat. There lukewarm soup.
Do not worry about these big fools.
Come sit.
Asterix village warrior.
Petiminus, mosaic.
I do not house you home, I had problems.
Blame the glans.
Obelix find you a solution.
So, what do we do?
About what?
Domaine des Dieux, to the
fact that not hit civilians.
Meanwhile, work continues.
And it will get more.
We must find a way to get rid of civil...
without typing it!
- This is the time, we go!
- Obelix!
And I raise my horn to the health of
residents of the Estate of the Gods!
Ah, finally! The famous Armorican rain!
And that at Rome, they stifle heat!
- Ave!
- Hi!
Hi!
- It is my fresh fish!
- You sell the how,
Your mackerel there?
Uh... a sesterce.
A sesterce! In Rome, he is five.
- And it's not fresh.
- Five!
Oh, no, no... We, here is uh... a.
Maybe because it was beside the sea...
In Rome, too, right?
In Rome, the sea is dirty.
I'll take three.
Yup!
Exclamation of anger.
You're proud of yourself?
What? I should refuse
to sell to the Romans?
If you were in Rome, you would sell
these fish five sesterces room!
If you were in Rome, you empesterais
a little less, especially.
- Incomplete file.
- Next!
- What is happening?
- I do not know, you see nothing.
- You know what happens?
- No, we see nothing.
We will try to sleep anyway.
It will never be worse than Rome.
And there, at least, there
was the rain that refreshes.
- Ave!
- Hi!
Hi!
Come on, hurry! The ladies
of the Estate of the Gods!
Four sesterces mackerel! Cheaper than Rome!
Oh! This trinket is delightful!
Watch Out! It is not
the trinket everyone.
It is a shield that
belonged to Vercingetorix.
Say! Te in factories
how much stuff that
belonged to Vercingetorix?
If you were going to fish?
This mummified your fish!
Incomplete applications!
Next!
You know what happens?
No, we see nothing!
We will try to sleep anyway!
It can never be worse than Rome!
There at least, rain is refreshing.
- Ave!
- Hi!
It costs how much?
Special Price Domaine des
Dieux: 40 sesterces.
If it had belonged to
Vercingetorix, he would triple!
First, I do what I want.
Deuzio is how the triple 40?
It's 120 sesterces.
At that price, I buy.
That's too much!
Say your fish belonged to Vercingetorix.
Given the smell, it not shock!
Oh look! It is picturesque! Well Done!
Next!
We got it!
We got it! We got it! We got it!
- We got it! We got it! We got it!
- We got it!
Hello! Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hola, qué tal?
Hat, hat, guys!
Impressive, Anglaigus! Very impressive!
And all this in time!
But it was not without difficulty, senator.
There he is proud. There are eight days
he held his pants with both hands.
- Well, it is!
- Centurion!
No, no, later.
Your senator will be gone.
What is it?
I promised to free them,
but I have no authority.
You have promised that?
And he paid them. And he gave them housing.
- What?
- Without that, we fought.
Let me do it.
Slaves!
By the powers conferred me
Caesar, the Roman people
and fuss, me, Senator Gaius Prospectus,
hop, snitch, I freed you.
- We are free?
- There You Go...
Pshaw, hey that, I can
tell you that it's nice.
Do not forget to check out of your homes.
We understood that we were awarded.
When you were slaves. Now you have to pay
15 sesterces rent per week.
15 sesterces! Anyway!
But good news!
Construction workers positions
come to break free.
- The salary is 15 sesterces per week.
- You accept?
Well, the proposal...
Pitch Perfect!
You are incurred.
Uh... Anglaigus, your
workers are not at work.
The nerve, lazy band!
We pay you what, exactly? Come on, hop!
- To the site!
- The whip cracks. And trot!
But it is slavery!
That it must be admitted,
you are efficient!
I Will Not... I am Senator!
They are new, my antiques!
For junk, contact the expert!
Father to son
since Vercingetorix!
September sesterces mackerel!
6.99 sesterces mackerel! 6.99!
Three mackerel offered for
three mackerel purchased!
It's been six mackerel at a price of...
I tell you that this
shield is not for sale!
Even for 450 sesterces?
That's offer? I packed you.
As usual, lemons are available.
Thank you.
You will give us two fish.
You eat fish now?
Obliged. There are over a boar
in the forest with this mess.
That will make 14 sesterces.
What? This is a joke?
It breaks my heart to raise prices,
but it is hardly more
expensive than in Rome.
Is theft! Drop your price!
Why? Even at seven, my fish
is sold as small antiques.
I take one!
- Mackerel for two?
- Exactly.
Fish is left? There was nothing to eat.
That does not concern me...
You all have become crazy!
Mr. Asterix prevents us
from typing civilians.
And when we welcome them,
he wants us to return.
You are ridiculous with your
mackerel seven sesterces.
Stop this circus and help us!
Help you what?
To do that the Romans leave and we
can shave the area of ​​the Gods.
WHAT?
To demolish the city,
it must first be emptied.
And customers?
For antiques, the Romans are the future.
There is no harm in grow trade.
Evil is that you have become greedy fools.
This is wrong! We had been fools.
And we are not greedy, no
one knows what it means.
- Do not worry, I do not bore you anymore.
- Verry good.
- I am moving to Domaine des Dieux!
- QUOl?
- I do too.
- I do too.
I will not stay in a town
that I do not recognize.
I abuse, but would not this the
perfect time for a farewell song?
Since that's it, I'm leaving too.
The Romans will welcome an artist.
And I tell you...
Assurancetourix!
If you come, it is now.
In short, I am outraged!
We want housing.
Leave the area without fuss.
We do not make a fuss.
But... it's impossible... Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Hello! Welcome! We will be happy...
What?
You're even dumber than you seem.
We do not host Gauls. What will Caesar?
The Gauls want to live like the Romans.
- Huh?
- The crazy desert their village.
What will Caesar
if he sees that his plan runs
1000 times better than expected?
I have more free housing.
Make room!
No problem!
We will fix you up.
Hercules arrives!
Phew! All Done!
We finally home!
Look! Look!
Come In!
Now what?
You have an idea, Asterix?
I need to notify the night.
It's weird that house. It looks like a box.
It is an apartment, Obelix.
If we knew which box was Apeldjus,
we'd gone to say hello.
Beautiful!
Beautiful!
The poison is working.
We must strike! Tell,
in Brittany, the inhabitants
of the rebel town
have a right to housing.
Domaine des Dieux!
Free for life!
"A beautiful free accommodation
awaits each family of Gallic village."
"Domaine des Dieux!"
Free housing?
If it allows me to see your heads, I go on.
You waiting for? You want some momentum?
Civilization would do me good!
Your fish and trinkets...
I am head of the village, Mimine.
We can not go.
I did not say that I will go with you.
Is not holding you. Will
make your head there!
Who said that?
Go all the Romans!
It will do less charlatans on the market!
Same for the fish. Place the professionals!
He is tired there.
- Of swindlers!
- Who is swindler?
It is you who say that!
Listen trinkets dealer!
The poisoner, you no better!
What do I do now?
I am going?
Yes We Do! Go ahead!
It is better to start with a light song?
As intro?
No no! Attack directly
with something powerful!
It's a new audience, it
must make an impression!
Well... Go to powerful...
More...
- What are you doing here?
- After deliberation,
we decided to approach
our beloved customers.
As such, we discourage
all welcome song.
The projectile used is
a pimp seven sesterces
of the highest quality.
Come on, kids! Let's go!
They are crazy these Gauls!
I feel that it calmed down.
You can go up the luggage.
Obelix!
You're there, you?
We're sorry, but...
we did not know where to go.
You did well.
Preparing his dozen!
Forward!
Oh! More...
A beautiful representation
architect at work.
Ave!
We go to the next building.
We remain grouped.
Grouped!
Steer everything! To the left!
More to the left! The other left!
I'm hungry!
What was I saying?
- When?
- There, right there!
You laugh diabolical way.
Evil rather... No, but before!
Oh... before we too must ask.
You said "finally".
Ah yes, "Finally!"
Finally, I want these irreducible!
After years of humiliation, four
buildings and a few matrons
have come to the end.
O Caesar! Our victory
over Gaul is complete!
I Will Not! It will total
that when no longer remain a log
of their ridiculous village.
Ouch!
Change of plans!
There is a village shaving!
It is diabolical that?
No, evil.
There!
- Have you seen one?
- I Do Not.
Why you turn?
To change the corner. There was nothing.
There! There! There!
Ah! Watch Out!
- So?
- No, still no boar.
They all left because of work.
There remains perhaps one or two.
Ben then?
I'm a little tired suddenly.
I rest five minutes.
I feel bad.
- That's because you got hungry.
- You think?
It's not you do that when you stay.
- Without eating?
- I still never long without eating.
Do not worry. I'll find you a boar.
Do not move, I return.
You're not too far away, right?
Apeldjus!
Idéfix!
LOAD!
Well? What are you doing?
One card that has just
passed the general strike.
- Unanimously!
- What?
We believe this dangerous assault.
Obviously, this is an assault.
It shaves a village.
We have said repeatedly:
War, yes, drudgery, no!
We demand guarantees.
The druid must be neutralized,
for the Gauls no longer
have the magic potion.
This is a joke?
We would also like to mention the courtesy.
Ineligible your...
Is unacceptable.
Soldiers want...
Destroy the village. I know, I heard.
"Shave the village."
The exact wording of the
order coming from Rome,
is "razing the village."
Seize them!
But there is nothing settled.
What? It is your druid.
You speak and it is there.
What do you want?
It remains the question
of free housing.
And what you think courtesy.
Stop them by Juno!
This is not about that tone
that things will get better...
O! O! O Caesar!
No building will rise high enough...
quite high...
to match... Huh?
No but... You laugh?
What am I doing that?
You have not built a prison, then...
I will not stand in my hall of honor.
Was ordered to put them inside prisoners
not for the Gauls see them.
This is nonsense! A main hall with a cage.
Soldiers snore.
Quite high... No, quite high!
Quite high!
Do not worry, Apeldjus.
Someone will help us.
I care not. Obelix will break everything.
Find a way to prevent...
I know!
Accepts that modest banquet in...
testimony... testimony...
Hey there! No horseplay!
Evidence of what?
Hercules...
Testimony...
- As testimony to you.
- Yes We Do!
You're even smarter than
I thought, Apeldjus.
I will not get all that
you stay at Domaine Gods.
You housed the slaves.
- It would repatriate our families.
- What?
I have not seen my wife for 22 years.
Me she was pregnant and I'm a grandfather.
Family reunification, centurion!
Apeldjus?
By Toutatis, I'm so hungry! Apeldjus?
Apeldjus!
Apeldjus!
Apeldjus? Apeldjus?
Panoramix!
Petiminus! Asterix! Look!
He had to get her something.
Apeldjus no risk. He is with Ob...
Obelix?
You are with Apeldjus? He returned?
Not since the river! Let's go!
Obelix, keeps the village!
I'm coming! Wait for me! Wait for me!
Obelix!
Obelix!
A legion does not live
in a luxury property,
touching 22 as a day.
I earn 10 per week.
Am making your rights.
And the big, centurion?
What a big centurion?
I Do Not. And the big... centurion?
But how big?
The big Gauls superhuman strength.
He remains at large.
We will not repeat
if the work is not neutralized.
And how I can
neutralize since...
These are not our business!
Just Listen... I'm hungry...
Stop, centurion!
You'll wake him.
Accept this modest meal...
No, this modest banquet...
You will take me all the prisoners?
Hush! Slowly, architect. You'll wake him.
Order was to conceal that one of the Gauls.
By the gods! They had Obelix!
As for the other two near the mosaic.
Your mosaic is damn bad!
- The farm!
- My dad said it!
Silence! He must quickly
seal it in a safe place.
And silent!
We followed the river
and found no Apeldjus!
We had to... pass... without notice.
Hey!
Now what?
The same thing the other way!
Quick!
Dulcia! Hold On!
I hope they have not made us
get up early for nothing.
To visit the dolmens,
it was not that early.
It gathers around me!
I hope we will have a snack.
It has water, it's something.
Please, listen to me.
We have the unique opportunity
this morning to be able to attend
a ra-ri-ssime event.
Loading... Please!
Archers at my command,
be kind enough to draw!
But do something!
What do I do?
I dunno. Go see the centurion!
What centurion?
Be kind to attack me minus!
- What?
- I said "be nice."
If the enemy has the potion, no fighting.
That's why we shut the druid.
Domaine Gods.
- What druid?
- Ours?
And the big, too.
How big?
Ours?
It's not strawberry juice he drank!
Not be fooled, it's flan!
The blank? In a gourd?
One is where there centurion?
We turkey stuffing or what?
Well... I get it, I get down.
After a moment...
COEST good cause, but you have to say...
stop!
So we superhuman strength?
You want a slap? You tell me
if it's quite superhuman.
Do not you ask the usual permission.
My first slaps, I reserve
the Roman calendar.
Those... in particular!
You are proud of yourself
with your ridiculous clothes!
"Civilian Roman"...
You, O Abraracourcix our chef!
You have deserted your village.
- What?
- I'll teach you to desert your village.
That is to say?
Admonishing you a slap
powerful, thanks to the magic potion...
I just drink. You are ready?
Ready for what?
To make a pie overkill
will send you waltz at the
other end of the forest.
By Toutatis, what power!
This can only be magic!
And Yo!
So much for your fish not fresh!
By Bélénos! What hammering!
So much for your antiques, pirate!
Brittany O!
Wet earth with blood, you avenge injustice.
I want to love you again
and ringing the armistice.
Hum, hum... So, they
have or not the potion?
They have, they have not... With
all that, I'm destabilized.
I have to go free Obelix and Getafix.
Look after them while I'm off.
Asterix, I'm so ashamed...
We'll see that later.
Friends! Our dear village is threatened.
This is the time to drink a
generous swig of our magic potion!
Do not worry too much.
- I'm not too much!
- YUP!
Centurion... in military
terms, what do we do?
I do not know, I'm destabilized.
We are in trouble.
Asterix! Quick! Apeldjus must be there,
but closed.
Why there?
Because it can only be there.
Open by Juno or I push the door!
Apeldjus!
The reception is closed by Vesta!
Opens architect!
- Asterix!
- Getafix!
How many are there?
Get out or I send the gard!
Guards! Do you get them!
It's up there!
- Apeldjus!
- Free the prisoners!
You're going to release them, saying!
When I tell you that the
mosaic has a defect...
is that it has...
a...
from a...
Need!
Apeldjus!
You know what?
And that one, did not you fly.
Daddy!
What have you done Obelix architect?
By The!
We do not have time to look for it.
We need to make the magic potion
and I need everyone.
Ouch!
You know? I was shut out.
You had forgotten me?
It's been an hour since it discutaille!
You attack or not?
If folds, you'll sue us or not?
Y is likely.
Well, we revote.
That is for the downturn?
Who is to attack?
So downturn.
Oh no...
- Children! We follow!
- YUP!
- My salt is called "back"!
- A dog took my grass!
Mackerel seven sesterces!
That is good. That I do not need it.
That... oh yes! That yes!
It... what is it?
Quick, Getafix! Quick!
You do not refugees you in
your apartment, centurion?
I have not. You've all taken.
Why they are out of breath?
Usually... We never
had time to flee.
Say.
What do you need more to admit that
they have not the potion, a sign?
Come on, kids... is loaded...
What's that this project?
Where is he?
He is here! Ah, my Caesar!
No building will rise high enough
to match the size Caesar!
Accepts that modest banquet...
a witness...
- u are welcome.
- I have not found.
Do you imagine that I came to Rome to eat?
Not even a little tart?
Here's one, tart! Removes all that grub!
And faster than that!
Hop, hop, hop! When
Caesar says "thrown"...
discarded.
Yeah, that's not true.
Stop all this world!
Getafix, quick!
Almost, almost...
Asterix!
I Will Not! The potion is not ready!
The potion is not ready!
Panoramix!
You lost, Gauls! This
time, Rome was stronger.
Your people. Admit it!
And subject yourself!
I will never submit to me.
I am... Asterix the Gallic warrior...
I was assured that the Gauls became Roman.
But, they are! They are!
O Caesar!
Take A Look! Your victory is complete!
Contemplate
your prisoners!
The civilization of wild mustaches...
is finally eradicated! And that stupid
little arrogant warrior
will now join his accomplice big...
the dungeon!
Obelix!
I'm not fat!
Is loaded!
- We load!
- ON CHARGE!
Charge!
Please!
Obelix!
Open! By order of Caesar open!
What are they doing out there?
They come to help us?
Yes, you could say that.
Pull It... without
wishing you order!
Kindly ti...
The final touch!
You... do not... pass!
The bearded, you clear!
Ah... It will not be the
same lemonade, there!
Friends, our freedom is again threatened
by the insidious tentacles...
COME ON! LET'S GO!
The Domaine des Dieux hope
you had a pleasant stay
and invites you to return to Rome by
the outputs provided for this purpose.
The fun is over!
This man, Obelix, it's for you.
- Of course!
- I saw the 1st.
Watch Out!
We meet!
Blows and moans.
Pull yourself together, for Mars!
I demand the name of an official.
The manager called Caesar, ma'am.
But what do you manufacture?
It's a long story. At
the end of the project,
it was necessary to consider retrain.
And here we were offered...
After a while it goes.
Hercules!
Whatever you my reservations,
Gauls, get dignity...
You are inflated to talk
about dignity, Jules.
- How To?
- The coup.
Domaine des Dieux is sneaky, deceitful,
calculated. You should be ashamed.
We try stuff. Sometimes
it works, sometimes...
It does not work. You're going back
to Rome and take them civilians.
You owe them a luxury accommodation.
And remember that there
is a village in Brittany
resists you again and again.
HOORAY!
Either... Veni, vidi vici...
not.
We can not "vici" every time either.
Come On! Everyone in Rome!
But I fell into the
potion when I was little.
So, I'm not allowed to drink.
Yes, we know... a small drop.
Thank you for everything, Astérix.
Rome will seem to us empty.
Here, Petiminus.
A memory of Brittany, compliments
the old Gallic druid.
Apeldjus cheek.
Here... It will do
you a figure more.
I'm sorry, that's all I know carve.
Apeldjus...
Watch Out! A menhir!
And this is for you!
Roman, Roman!
The program tonight... it's hard!
It's formi... It's great!
The small dry while, you start
by a blow to the liver.
Then you turn around
toward the big yucky for sun projection.
The big yucky, it's me. We leave it?
After the coup of the robin.
And it easy, not like in training.
The "robin"
what is it again?
Immobilization, strangulation.
It was repeated three times!
Do as in training and
you will not hurt.
But one got hurt.
Get hurt!
You do that in your head!
Thank the divine Caesar
for the gladi glagla... the gladiators!
AVE CAESAR! AVE CAESAR!
AVE CAESAR!
Pick me out of here! Or is
it the lions for everyone!
You hear? Lions for 75,000 people!
Beautiful!
He has an incredible talent, it Petiminus!
That's nice, he dressed you in Gaul...
Sarcasm recommence the
I dressed as Roman to approach the enemy.
Correct!
Hey! We are Gaulle! It
stands well at the table!
Traitor!
Who is a traitor?
Invincible, it is!
Not better!
Irreducible, it is!
YUP!
Right, guys? Ir-Re-patible Duke!
I told him straight out:
I ce-de-rai not on the claims.
Finalis sharp!
