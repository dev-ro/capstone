One, two, three, four, five.
Solid.
One, two, three, four, five.
Just stay out of trouble.
That's easy for you to say.
Hurry up.

hello?
Hey. It's your dad.
Who?
You know your father.
Um, he's at work
right now.
C-can you just, um,
Go get your mom?
Um, uh... Yeah.
Mom!
Hello?
Hey.
Who's this?
It's me.
I just got out.
Fuck.
Look, I kept my mouth shut.
What does he want from me?
I don't even know where they are.
Geez!
Ohh!
This is your idea of shelter?
It's got potential.
Please.
It's a shit-hole.
Nothing that can't be fixed.
Fixed?
It should be condemned.
Really?
How's betty ford?
Still a raging cunt.
So how long before the orderlies realize
that you're missing?
Eh, they're not paid enough to care.
So, what kind of racket are you pulling here?
What makes you think that there's
a racket to be pulled?
For one, the kitchen is derelict.
And two, you didn't buy this place to sling hash.
I know you.
You know me?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you know, keep your friends close.
You don't keep friends.
What's that supposed to mean?
Present company excluded, of course.
Of course.
I mean, it's been a while,
but I still know when you're bluffing.
Really?
What's my tell?
Well, you know, if, uh--
If I told you that,
it'd be a lot less fun for me,
And that's just not
the way I ro--
Well!
This is unexpected.
How subtle.
I mean, the architecture is a little
too ming dynasty, don't you think?
Not exactly japanese.
It's a work in progress.
And you have party favors.
Which one of your goons picked her out?
I did.
Mm-hmm.
And is she, uh, full service, as they say?
Maybe.
Maybe?
It depends.
Depends on what?
Don't be so cute.
It depends on how the night goes.
Mmm.
Ah.
Who are we waiting on?
You'll see.
Oh, you know I hate surprises.
What is she, a fucking vegetable?
She's supposed to be.
You need to think of her
as, uh, an edible plate.
In that case, I'd like to skip dinner
and go right to dessert.
Mm-mm-mmm.
Sushi's free.
Girl's not.
Oh. Even for
an old friend?
House rules.
Domestic or imported?
Everything is imported.
How come she isn't a soy nigger?
I'm sorry.
A soy what?
I'm just sayin'.
I know you like the yellows.
I only like one shade of yellow.
But comfort women come in many colors.
Well, either way you put on a good show.
I do try, Crow.
No, no, I-I mean it.
Place like this, could have been
laundry or the shake.
Something classy.
Until I saw the inside.
Never would have pegged it for a--
- Whorehouse?
Or a meat market.
Take your pick.
I'll take both.
Would it have killed you to knock?
What the fuck is he doing here?
Same thing you are.
Come on.
No, I don't drink.
Bad for the job.
You're not on the job yet.
Well, to old times, I suppose?
Nice to see some things haven't changed.
- Eat my shit.
- Charming.
Children, play nice.
- I'm not working with this faggot again.
- Have another drink, Max.
- Why is he here?
- We need him.
He'll just bitch out again.
You know that.
Hello.
I'm standing right here.
You're a fucking pussy.
Oh, are you still upset about the nose?
What the fuck is this?
What does it look like?
Looks like four-fifths
of a reunion...
At a titty buffet...
In tiananmen square.
Well, hello back.
Glad to see we're all up to our usual tricks.
Who's filling in for the jailbird?
Nobody.
Thought you said this was a five-man thing.
It is.
Jailbird flew the coop.
No!
It's the truth.
- It's only been six years.
- Good behavior.
That's total bullshit.
What'd you do?
Not as much as I thought I'd have to.
Man, you know I'm--
I know...
That you've been off the wagon for about what,
Five months?
Don't you insult me.
Besides, you do want to be here to celebrate...
Our little jailbird's return
to freedom tonight, don't ya?
More.
You didn't say the magic word.
Fuck you.
Fuck the magic word.
Where's the fifth wheel?
I want to get paid.
Relax.
You can give him a few more minutes.
He just got out.
You know how that goes, don't you?
Well, his daddy did.
I warned you the last time.
Max!
Control yourself.
That's all you got, huh?
Uh, Crow.
What?
Oh, christ.
Where's the bathroom?
Right over there.
Ain't no glory hole in there,
if that's what you're looking for,
You fuckin' puss.
So... It's gonna be
one of those nights.
You know, if we're gonna be
opening up old wounds,
Don't you think we should
have a little bit more privacy?
Yeah, well, we're not gonna
talk about all this in front of her,
Are we?
You don't have to worry about her.
Why?
Because you own her?
What's the matter?
You don't trust my powers of persuasion?
Besides, we're just waiting
for the party to get started.
Ain't that right, Fish?
What is this?
What is it?
Your welcome back party.
Surprised?
Couldn't you have gotten me
some strippers or a hooker or something?
Oh, I'm sure Duke could arrange that...
After dinner.
Welcome back, Fish.
Have a drink with us.
Do I have a choice?
It's wicked good to see you.
I wish I could say the same.
Oh, come on.
Let's not get off on the wrong foot, shall we?
Let's have a proper toast.
To old friends...
And fallen comrades.
Mmm.
Who's hungry?
Yeah.
Wouldn't want it to get cold.
Nah, the fancy plate will keep it warm.
It's sushi, genius.
It's served cold.
I know.
Crow.
How quaint.
Really?
Ah-ah-ah.
Ow! What the fuck?
This is a special occasion.
Let's be civilized.
You want to say grace first?
Tonight is the first night in six years...
That our boy Fish has breathed free air.
I thought we might do something unique.
Six years, five months and 17 days,
If you count from the time of the arrest.
Ah.
Well, this lovely array of sushi
isn't just a pretty platter.
No, it's dessert too.
Tonight we dine yakuza style.
The outermost portions contain
your standard "plain jane" sashimi.
But as we move inward
toward the erogenous zones,
The meal becomes
more... Adventurous.
The innermost portion contains the pot of gold.
Fugu, as they call it, is a yakuza delicacy.
Fubu.
Fu...
Gu.
Poisonous blowfish.
At its best, it numbs your lips,
Gives you heart palpitations,
Makes you feel like you've touched death
and lived to talk about it.
At its worst, well--
Hundreds die in japan every year from eating it.
It's a test of mettle in their culture.
We start on the outside and work our way in.
The closer we get to the fugu,
The more exotic the flavor...
And the more of a man you are.
I'm pissin' my pants.
Yeah. Laying it on
a little thick there, Duke.
All of this is for me?
You know, maybe I should have
mentioned this before, but, um...
I fucking hate sushi.
Too bad.
More for the rest of us.
I can't wait to eat shredded blowfish
off a warm cooter.
Ooh, I'd buy that for a dollar.
Aw, what the f--
fuckin' jap bullshit.
Where are the goddamn forks?
So let me get this straight.
You can kill a man with your bare hands,
but you don't know how to use chopsticks.
Fuck with me again.
Gentlemen, yakuza don't bicker like this.
Aw, fuck the yakuza!
Where's my money?
Max, sit.
Sit!
Let's not play the blame game tonight, okay?
Not before this wonderful meal
that we're about to receive.
Everything will be evident in time.
I don't have 'em.
Eat.
Huh?
We got all night to talk about
everything that happened...
Six years,
Five months and 17 days ago.
I don't have them.
Look, I kept my mouth shut.
I did my time.
I just want to go home.
I said I'd like to enjoy this meal.
If this is supposed to be my last supper,
let's just cut to the fucking chase.
All right, Fish.
If you insist.
What do you want from me?
There's a few loose ends that we need to tie up.
Loose ends?
Yeah, you know.
Those little sparkly loose ends in that bag.
The cops took 'em.
They're the only
loose ends.
Them ends ain't loose no more.
And they didn't know shit.
Where's my money?
Do you really think I would try
to rip you all off?
I just wasted the last six years
of my life protecting all of you.
That's no absolution.
We want what's owed us.
And I want my six years back,
but I ain't gonna get 'em.
Just like you're not gonna
get your fuckin' diamonds.
Spare us the sob story and tell us the truth.
What do you think the truth is?
You think I magically stashed the diamonds
a block away from where the cops got me?
What am I, fucking harry houdini?
Papers say all you had was an empty bag.
Man, fuck the papers.
Papers say those cops were innocent.
How about it, Max?
Were they really innocent?
Did you even let them talk
before you mangled them?
Man, I saved
all you motherfuckers
from prison.
We appreciate that, Fish.
We really do.
But we want our cut.
Yes. Our cut.
How do you know Max didn't kill the cops
and take the money for himself, huh?
What?
Fucking cocksuc--
Max!
Stop! Please!
Or maybe Crow.
Maybe he paid 'em off.
And maybe Francis snorted it all away.
Oh, fuck you.
Yeah! Maybe!
Or-- or maybe you--
maybe you--
Enough!
I'm gonna ask you nicely one more time.
Tell us where the diamonds are.
Keep yourself in one piece.
We'll even let you keep your share.
I can't.
I think you can.
How many of those are you
planning on actually using?
All of 'em.
Fuck.
Hey, you goddamn cokehead, I gotta take a shit!
- He's been in there 20 fucking minutes already.
- Chill.
Hey, scarface, are you done in there or what?
You've made it this long.
What's a few more minutes?
I downed half a bottle of laxatives this morning, asshole.
What do you think?
What the hell'd you do that for?
You always clear your shitter before a job.
- What?
- Just--
Goddamn, you are fucking green, aren't you?
- Ever hear of Vinnie Parker?
- No. Who the fuck is Vinnie Parker?
Aw, fuckin' shit.
Not this again.
Jesus, if I had a dollar for every time
I've heard this story--
I have it memorized.
Okay--
Once upon a time,
There's this cat--
Vinnie fucking Parker, right?
This guy is the best driver in town.
He's like a--
a born motorhead, right?
I mean, crazy about this shit.
Woulda barebacked mario andretti
if he got the chance.
So...
He goes out...
With the Munsey twins, couple of retards,
On this big brinks gig couple years back.
Heist goes bad.
Couple of chicks get shot
or something, I don't know.
But thanks to Vinnie Parker,
they get away with almost two million cash.
Yeah.
Not even 10 minutes into their fuckin' freedom,
Goddamn Donald Munsey,
like the fuckin' idiot retard that he is,
H-h-he looks out the window
and makes eye contact...
With this beat cop on the sidewalk, right?
Cop recognizes him, calls it in
and the next thing you know,
They've got the entire
fucking force up their ass.
Oh, fuck.
You gotta be kidding me.
So anyway, Vinnie fucking Parker
leads them on this amazing five-hour chase,
Only to run out of gas in the middle
of the San Fernando fucking freeway.
Okay? He jumps out of the car,
guns are blazin'.
None of these guys want to go
back to the joint, of course.
Sure enough, Vinnie Parker ends up
with two bullets in his face...
And his bowels release
all over the goddamn scene.
Oh, you think that's funny, cupcake?
Listen to me.
He held that shit all day!
He thought he was gonna get to go after the gig.
But he was wrong, wasn't he?
Sure, and some fucking 'copter
overhead catches it,
Airs it on
the 6:00 fucking news.
Poor Vinnie,
laying there dead--
Blood oozin' out of one end,
piss and shit flowin' out of the other--
And it's all over
the goddamn 6:00 news.
I just--
You know, I wasn't expecting it
to go in that direction.
His mama saw that shit.
Literally.
Look, I don't know about you assholes,
But if I get my ass shot off on a job,
I sure as shit want to go out with
a little fucking dignity, okay?
Get the fuck outta the way, asshole!
Laxatives again?
Wow.
All right, gentlemen, come and get your masks.
What the fuck?
Hey, these are classic noh theater masks.
Yeah, "no" is right.
I'm not wearing that faggot shit.
Can't we wear hockey masks or ski masks?
This is my job.
It's my rules.
Shit, I'd wear panty hose on my face, man!
No one needs to hear what you do
for fun on weekends, Max.
Har-dee-fucking-har.
Here you go, Max.
You get to wear the okame,
because you're so chipper.
Fuck me.
Crow?
Yes?
You get to wear the kitsune.
Why?
Because you're so sly.
Oh, I get it.
Francis.
The tenis for you.
It should be
self-explanatory.
Asshole.
The saru
is for Nelson.
Ah.
The hannis for me.
And Fish, the rookie,
gets to wear the sambaso.
Everything come out okay?
You got a little something on your nose, asshole.
Hey. Hey. Here.
Pull the van around front.
All right?
Let's roll.
Don't forget your mask.
Come on, fellas!
Give me your gun.
Why?
Just give me your gun.
Here.
What the fuck is this?
New guy always has a little gun.
Eh?
Plus, you're the bag man.
That means you might turn traitor on us.
Small gun, small bullets, no traitor.
Yeah, well, I don't want to be the bag man then.
- You ain't got a choice.
- Why not?
Because the new guy is the most expendable.
Let's go.
Don't worry about it, new guy.
It's all part of the initiation.
Yeah, I got that.
It's just, when you mentioned
we'd be wearing disguises,
This is not what I had in mind, you know?
Well, that's Duke for ya.
Larger than life.
Come on.
Time to get to work.
That's it.
Is the party over already?
I really wish it hadn't come to this.
But you don't leave us many options.
Man, I told you everything I know.
I got something I want to show you.
You know what this is?
What's that, a trick question?
Answers, not attitude,
Is the name of the game tonight...
Fish.
You have me tied to this chair.
I'm a little disadvantaged.
Funny you should say that.
You ever been to pittsburgh?
Never.
Mmm.
Dirty town.
Rotten to the core.
Rusted over, covered in soot.
My papa used to pour slag in a steel mill.
You ever seen the inside
of a steel mill? Huh?
Well, I have.
The old man used to
drag me down to work with him.
Hotter than hell.
Smelled like fire and sweat.
People walking around with
blackened faces, sad eyes.
What's this got to do with the timer?
I'm getting to that.
Stop wasting my time.
Be careful what you wish for.
Me and that clock have shared
a lot of time together.
See, when all you do
for a living is poke lava...
In a coal-powdered asshole
in pennsylvania,
You develop some nasty habits.
I used to be deathly afraid of that timer...
Because whenever it went off, it meant my ass.
My daddy, he got it from a P.O.W. Camp
outside of Hiroshima.
He used to scare me to death with stories
about the "savage yellow man"...
Relentlessly beatin' the shit out of him.
He should have been around
when we dropped the bomb.
Whenever I complained, he said I had it easy.
I ain't had no gratitude
'cause I ain't seen
no prison camp.
That's why he took me
down to the mill--
Teach me some respect.
My father gave me three minutes
on that timer to show some respect.
And if he didn't like...
What I had to tell him by the time
he heard that... Ding--
I tried my best to cover the bruises.
Eventually, it didn't matter what I said or did.
He'd just set the timer back to three minutes.
Until one day, I set that timer.
He didn't lay a finger on me after that.
He didn't pour no slag no more either.
I stuck around long enough to watch
his ashes mix with that black cloud...
Spewing from the belly of that steel mill.
And then I split.
I had to find out where this came from.
I had to discover the culture...
That had inspired so much hatred...
In my daddy.
I had to go back to ground zero.
And you know what I found out?
Hmm?
That I was just like them.
Perhaps this timer...
Is my very first trophy.
I'm gonna take one from you...
If you don't give up those diamonds.
You got three minutes.
Okay.
Who's first?
I'm going.
No.
I'm going.
I called it.
You called it?
Fuck.
I'm not scared of you.
Not yet...
Douche.
You know, your tough guy act's
a real charmer, Max,
But it's not gonna get us our money back.
- Is this really necessary?
- Do you want your share or not?
Yeah, but come on, man.
He's one of us.
"one of us"?
You barely know the asshole!
What if he really
doesn't know? Huh?
What'd you say?
What if it was you?
Hey, if it was me, I wouldn't be here.
Oh, fine.
Fuck it. Whatever.
Take it away, big boy!
This isn't gonna get you your money.
No?
No.
Convince me.
No, no, no, no.
Let's not be premature.
Give him his time.
Follow the rules.
You were the one that interrogated the cops.
What did they say?
Well, don't matter what they said.
Can't trust a dirty cop, now can ya?
Besides, if they had the stuff,
oh, I woulda gotten it from 'em.
You can do whatever you want to me, Max.
It ain't gonna get you paid.
Maybe not.
I'm gonna have me some fun anyway.
Goddamn it, that felt good.
I'm gonna give you till the count of three.
One.
Two.
Okay.
Time!
That's enough.
Jesus.
Bravo, slapsie maxie!
Well done!
You really pulled it out of him there, huh?
- Like you could do better.
- Oh!
Is that a challenge?
Damn right it is.
Well... You wanna put
some money on it?
You're gonna bet on this?
It's torture.
Oh, no, it's not.
Not yet anyway.
You ain't getting soft on us, are you, Francis?
So how about it, big guy?
You want to wager which one of us cracks him first?
How much?
A thousand?
That's a fuckin' pussy bet.
All right, five.
Okay, faggot, you're on.
Oh, you are in deep doo-doo now, my friend.
Oh, Duke.
Why didn't you tell me you had...
All these fun playthings here already?
Oh!
You sentimental old slob.
You kept my old work shoes!
Well...
This we'll have to save for later.
How about a little lesson
in how to use chopsticks, Max?
Motherfucker.
So how about it, fishy boy?
Got anything to say?
Not to you.
That's too bad.
What the fuck are you gonna do with those, man?
Acupuncture.
How about it, fella?
Are you ready to stroll down memory lane?
Fuck you.
Now, see, that is just a bad attitude.
Come on.
Talk to me.
Anything coming to the surface in there?
How about now?
Nothin'?
Okay.
Now listen to me.
You start talking, the hammer goes away.
All right?
Yeah.
Come on!
All right. Don't say
I didn't warn you.
Wait! Wait!
Wait. Wait. Wait.
I remember.
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah? Yeah?
What do you remember?
I remember--
yeah?
I fucked your mother.
Fucked my mother?
Fucked my mother.
I'll show you "fucked my mother."
Time!
I said time!
Aww!
Max is right.
Crow.
You are a fuckin' faggot.
Crow.
Crow!
We're on the move.
Ah!
Ohhh.
Oh, juicy.
Juicy.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Juicy, juicy. Look at me.
Morris.
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, yeah. Look at you.
So juicy.
Morris.
- Morris.
- What?
We got visitors.
Well, what are you looking at me for?
Why don't you get Rabbi Rojo...
And go out there and tell 'em to fuck off!
Schlomo!
What?
Plumbers?
Who called the plumbers?
You didn't block up the toilet again, did ya?
That shit's not kosher.
Hey!
You can't park here.
Hey, asshole!
You can't park here.
What the fuck?
Hands up! Hands up!
I said fuckin' hands up!
I already pressed the alarm!
Police are gonna be here any minute!
You guys better get the fuck outta here!
Yeah, right.
Get down!
Get down!
Don't you fucking move!
Now, you plan on getting any more wise ideas?
You-- you can't have 'em.
I am not asking!
I'm taking!
You don't know who you're stealing from!
Clearly we're stealing from you.
You see this?
It's a souvenir.
I take one of these from everybody I kill.
Do you want me to take one from you?
You don't know what they'll do to me!
I'd be more worried about
what we'll do to you, man!
Jesus Christ, morris!
Just give this cock-nosed point break
motherfucking wannabe the bag!
Shut the fuck up!
Yeah! Shut the fuck up!
I don't have the key.
That's okay.
I do.
No.
No.
No!
Let me give you a hand.
Oh, holy fuck!
Aw, man up.
Oh, christ.
Oh, fuck.
Fish, come on! Fish!
- Fish.
- Fish, you piece of shit.
- Fish!
- Fish!
Goddamn it.
Wakey, fuckin' wakey, man.
Come on.
Come on.
Be a big boy.
Wake up for me.
Come on.
All right.
And we're back.
Nice try.
You sure he needed mouth-to-mouth though?
Ah, bite me.
You're on deck.
Why don't you go next?
I'm eatin'.
Don't want to get your hands dirty?
Why are you here, Francis?
I mean, if you don't want to contribute,
Maybe you don't want your share of the profits.
Are you in, or are you out?
Oh, I'm in.
But I'm sitting this round out.
I'm eating.
What are you gonna do, stink him to death?
I'm done with this sissy shit.
Suck my dick.
What was that?
I couldn't hear ya.
Well, speak up.
Say something, boy!
Time!
Max! I said time!
Fuck!
I hate this game!
Oh, now your sock is all wet.
Bummer.
Well, don't have a hissy fit.
Jesus christ.
Sit on my fucking fist, you pansy.
Oh.
You wish.
You know what?
I think...
It's about that time.
Uh-uh-uh, Crow.
Remember what we said about patience?
The timer still needs to be reset.
Get ready to pay up, maxie.
Hi there.
My goodness.
He really did a number on you,
all right. Ooh.
Well, I'm afraid...
We're gonna have to take a closer look.
What's the matter, Francis?
You don't have the stomach for this anymore?
Did I ever?
You didn't seem to have a problem with
wanton violence six years ago.
Things are different now, man.
I got a kid to support.
Now open up, say "ahhh!"
Oh, come on.
Hey.
I'll give you a lollipop when we're done, huh?
All right. Now look.
We can do this the easy way,
or we can do it the hard way.
Why'd you make us come here tonight?
I didn't make you do anything.
Why?
All right.
I thought you might want your cut.
You especially have been
bitching about needing money.
Since when do you ever pony up for charity?
This is hardly charity.
There we go.
Attaboy.
I know what you're doing.
Is that so?
Is that what you told your friends outside?
Now...
Speak now, or forever hold your peace.
What did you say?
You heard me.
Yep.
Just as I feared.
Mr. Tooth decay
is on the March.
We're gonna have to remove another.
Where the hell you goin'?
The fucking bathroom.
Kid's got no respect for good entertainment.
Daddy's a fuckup.
Ooh!
You know, the lack of dental hygiene...
In state prisons is a real travesty.
I think I spied some more cavities in there.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
What was that?
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
You will, huh?
Now, we've played this little game before, Fish.
You remember what happens when you lie?
So, talk.
You were--
you were right.
I was?
Oh, well! Fancy that.
What about?
Diamonds.
You don't say.
I was--
I was running from the cops.
Snake eyes.
They were--
they were closing in,
So--
come on!
So?
I had... No choice.
Where are they now?
Where did you put 'em?
I had... No choice.
Fish, where are the fucking diamonds?
Fish, where are the fucking diamonds?
Max!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Tell us what you did with our shit!
Where's my money!
Where's our money?
Fish.
Come on, Fish.
Yes. Come on. Say something.
Aw, Jesus Christ.
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no. D-d-don't move.
Don't move.
I'm gonna get an ambulance.
No, no, no.
Nelson, you fucking asshole!
Where the hell are we?
Go get those masks.
What's going on?
Shit!
Aw, man. I think it's broken!
- Shit. Where they coming from?
North.
We gotta get out of here.
Nelson.
Nelson!
Oh, fuck.
- Come on. Let's move.
- We gotta get out of here.
Ah, suck it up!
That's my bad arm, you fuckin' douche bag!
- Aw, fuck me, man. They're getting closer.
- Move, move!
Hey, rookie!
Bring me that fuckin' bag!
Ah, man!
Shit! Shit!
Split up!
Split up!
He's fuckin' dead.
You fucked up, mongoloid!
He's dead!
What?
- He's dead!
- Are you sure?
I'm not a fuckin' doctor, but yes,
I'm pretty fucking sure!
We needed him alive, Max!
Oh, I knew it!
I fucking knew it!
You fucked this up just like you
fucked up with the goddamn cops.
I didn't fuck nothin' up.
Bullshit.
Bull-fucking-shit!
You are a fucking failure, man.
Just like your fuckin' father.
- You fucking--
- oh, oh, oh. Come on.
Ooh-ooh!
Give me an excuse.
Ah. You pussy.
Don't you fucking get it, ya moron?
That's it. No more information.
Game over!
Get your fucking gun off me.
We get nothing now because of you.
We were never gonna get anything.
What the fuck does that mean?
It means this whole night has been bullshit.
I'm not doing this, Duke.
You ain't got no choice.
I'm leaving.
It ain't over, Francis.
It will be soon enough.
Oh, whoa.
You got me by the balls, huh?
You thought I'd just let you walk out of here?
What the fuck's going on?
Tell them why we're really here, Duke.
They know.
Do they?
Loose ends?
Motherfuckin' diamonds.
When the fuck are you gonna wake up?
The only loose ends here are us.
What are you sayin'?
We've been set up?
He brought us here to get rid of Fish...
And then the rest of us.
That's a hard pill to swallow.
Is it?
You're smart, Crow.
Do the math.
He paid off those cops to retrieve
the loot and pin it on Fish.
Same cops Max got rid of.
Six years later,
Fish gets out of jail, and we all end up dead.
He walks with our money, no questions asked.
No loose ends.
Wraps up nice and pretty, doesn't it?
Hmm. I guess this is the point where
the police storm the building, right?
What? More cops?
Sure are.
As a matter of fact,
They're listening in
on our conversation right now.
Well, where are they, Francis?
You're wired?
Yeah. Right.
I'm fuckin' wired.
Why don't you just go ahead
and unbutton your shirt.
When are you gonna open your eyes, Crow?
You're a puppet.
Open your shirt.
How long are you gonna let him pull the strings?
Francis, open your goddamn shirt!
Or what?
You gonna shoot me?
If you're gonna shoot me, then shoot me!
Prove there ain't no wire, boy.
Maybe then we'll believe your bullshit.
Yeah, how about it, Francis?
Prove it to you?
What's the point, Max?
You're even worse than Crow.
At least Duke talks to him
like he's a real person.
I wouldn't go there if I were you.
You?
You're nothing but a dog.
Duke just snaps his fingers,
and you run to do his bidding.
You're his fucking bitch.
How's that collar feel?
We were his bargaining chips.
More crooked cops waiting to take our cash.
Max, what the fuck are you doin'?
I'm tired of this cat and mouse shit.
I want my cut.
You don't want to do this.
I ain't your fuckin' dog.
Put the gun down.
This motherfucker has been holding out
on us for six years.
You actually believe that coked-up,
lying piece of shit?
I don't believe any of you assholes.
Max,
If I wanted to kill you,
You'd be dead already.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Max, put down the fuckin' gun.
Not till I get paid.
Listen, you stupid fuck.
Francis was full of shit.
He's always been full of shit!
If he's so full of shit, where's his wire?
In the fucking bathroom, you neolithic 'tard.
He went to the bathroom!
- You're so fucking sure, ain't ya?
- Yeah.
Hey. When has Duke
ever steered us wrong, huh?
Don't matter.
We ain't no three amigos here.
"all for one and one for all," my ass.
That's the three musketeers,
you illiterate dunce.
You think you're so smart.
Think you're smart enough to dodge a bullet?
Now, boys,
Let's not get out of hand.
Huh?
How about that, faggot?
How smart are you?
Oh, I'm the faggot, am I?
Let me tell you how smart I am.
Smart enough to know what your daddy
did behind closed doors.
Fuck you.
No. Fuck your daddy.
Just like he fucked you.
Fuck.
Still standing.
Pussy.
Hey.
Oh, fuck.
I-I need a hospital.
Duke.
What are you doin'?
I need a hospital.
Oh, come on, Duke.
After all we've been through?
From the killing fields...
To the kill.
I stood up for you, asshole.
I loved ya,
ya fucking son of a b--
Abayo.
Hmm.
Well,
That went well.
It's just you and me now, kid.
It's unfortunate I didn't find out
where my diamonds are.
So you'll have to be my consolation prize.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
A wise man once wrote,
"I cannot see her tonight.
I must give her up.
So I will eat...
Fugu."
Oh!
Simple pleasures.
Ooh.
That's more like it.
Fugu can be quite satisfying.
When it's cut the right way,
It's a real thrill.
But I didn't think...
That the toxin would get
the better of you so fast.
- So,
we're gonna have to make this quick.
Oh.
Well, I bet...
If you could talk right now,
You'd be asking,
"why?"
Well,
Long story short, you took something...
That belongs to me.
And I want it back.
So maybe this will jog your memory.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, are you okay?
Are you all right?
Yeah. Are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.
All right. We made it.
All right.
Now I'm gonna go check on them.
Okay.
Okay?
You're okay.
Just wait right here.
I'll be right back.
Nelson, you fucking asshole!
Where the hell are we?
Hey, rookie!
Bring me that fuckin' bag!
Shit! Shit!
Split up!
You know,
I've never been much of a gambler,
But you--
You seem to be the type that likes to bluff.
Maybe you need a new game.
Chance--
Is a real bitch.
One little thing can come along...
And ruin everything.
Six years ago,
I never imagined I'd be here.
I was so happy until you crashed into my life.
At first I thought,
Well, maybe...
I could buy happiness.
But some things just can't be bought.
Money can't buy my life back.
And money--
Money won't bring my love back.
But this--
This feels...
So good.
Please.
Where to now?
I just want to go home.
