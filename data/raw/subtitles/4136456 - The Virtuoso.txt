It's only me.
Your father was a good soldier.
- So you've said.
- It's a fact.
And you too.
So the medals say.
It's a family business.
I figured that I might find you here
since you don't answer the phone.
- I needed some time.
- I understand.
Till now, you were perfect, on point.
I rushed you, I know.
Couldn't be helped.
It's on me, not you.
Yeah.
Collateral damage. It happens.
You know that.
This is not Amarijah.
I know what happened there.
You shouldn't let this stuff
get to you, kid.
I'm not.
It's not your fault.
Did your father ever tell you
about Pinkville?
No. Never spoke of it.
Ah, that's not surprising.
That's where we met, you know... Pinkville.
Me and your old man.
We were just young kids,
fresh out of boot camp.
One night, the officers told us,
"Tomorrow you'll meet the enemy,
a whole battalion of gooks,
Viet Cong, who killed your...
friends, your relatives,
who'd kill your, uh, family
and rape your sister if they could."
So, we kids, we toked it up,
and the officers, they just drank it up,
because, you know, they were...
they were preparing us, as they say.
So we were prepared and...
we woke at 3:00 a.m.,
jumped on those choppers and...
we took off...
to kill or be killed.
It's really simple
when you think about it.
Only, finally, when we got there,
already the intelligence was bad,
because usually it was.
Because there was no hostile fire.
There was no fire at all, really.
There were just old men,
women and children,
sitting around fires, heating their rice,
ready for breakfast.
So, the officers, they just
gathered up all these...
the old men and the women
and the children,
even their pigs and their dogs
and their cats and, uh...
pushed them into ditches.
And, uh, they ordered us,
me and your old man,
to, um, plug them.
So we did. Clip after clip after clip.
Like a couple of automats
staring at each other, just firing and...
So we couldn't see the target,
the blood and the... carnage.
Until we stopped firing.
And then, as bad as that was,
when it was over, we started to have lunch
right there near the ditches.
And, you know, maybe 10, 15 feet away
from the bodies,
from the stench and the groaning.
Anyway, suddenly we hear this noise.
It was a whine or a squeal or something.
Maybe it was one of their pigs.
So, we all go to the top of the ditch
and we look in for the first time.
And it's, um... [chuckles]
This ain't no pig. No, sir.
It's a little boy,
two, maybe three, tough to say.
But his mother must've sheltered him
with her own body.
And he was too young to know that he
should've just played dead, stupid kid.
So the whole squad is watching him now,
uh, crawling on tiny hands
and feet over dead bodies,
probably his whole family.
And then, uh, none of us is moving.
We're just watching.
Maybe just rooting for the kid.
Till he gets to the top and he starts
running away towards the jungle.
The jungle.
And still none of us moves.
And then this little guy, this officer,
this lieutenant,
he comes running up to us
and he's still finishing his K rations.
And he sees all of us
staring at the tree line,
and then he sees the kid,
maybe 30 yards away, still going.
And he looks at me, and he looks
at your old man, and he says, "Plug him."
Pointing at the kid. "Plug him.
Shoot him."
So, I look at your old man
and he looks at me, and...
[chuckles] I can see clear as day
in his eyes, he can't, he's done.
So I look back to this lieutenant,
this heartless little motherfucking prick
of a human fucking being...
and he looks at me and he smiles.
He points at the kid, he said,
"Plug him, Goddamn it.
Shoot him."
Yeah.
[laughs] Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I was a good soldier that day.
- How could he live with that?
- Huh?
How could he live with that?
How could you?
We were soldiers. It's what we do.
It's what we did.
Taking orders from our superior officers.
We followed them.
Did we regret it? Sure.
I had no guilt, because...
we were not responsible for it.
That's not what we trained for.
Yeah. But I'll tell you this...
[laughs]
We humans, we human beings,
whatever we are,
we're just homicidal killing machines.
Get it? Homicidal killing
machines, that's all.
And all the military training
and all that stuff,
oh, it's just finishing school.
You'd better believe it, kid.
Yeah.
God, what a beautiful day, huh?
Anyway, 25 years later,
I ran into this guy,
this guy from our squad.
And I could tell straightaway
by just looking at him
that he'd never forgotten.
He was all busted up inside.
Do you know what I mean?
I remember he looked at me
and he said to me, "You know...
some of us will walk in those jungles
and hear those cries
of anguish and horror...
for all eternity."
Yeah.
But me and your Dad,
we didn't.
And I'm grateful for that.
Yep.

You've been taught that,
in this situation,
it's best to appear
like a burglary gone bad.
You take cash, credit cards,
even a few things of minimal value,
and ransack the place.

If this is the real Deputy Myers,

You can't risk starting the car.
Plumes from the tailpipe will act just

No bars.

for the impostor.
You hope that he leaves
the scene quickly.
But if he doesn't leave soon,
you're going to have to risk it.

Got a bit of a problem here.
Yeah, I can see that.
Uh, did you call for help?
Well, my radio, I think it went out

Tried my cell. No signal.
Huh.
Just my cell.
Uh, yeah. Me, too. No signal.
Where you coming from?
East.
You know anything about a, um, burglary
few miles back?
Burglary? Can't say that I do.
You see, I got a 911 call,
which by itself is unusual in this town.
It's the home of a local woman.
Even more unusual, at the scene,
there's a man shot dead
in one of the bedrooms.
And it looks like the woman
was there, possibly wounded.
But there's no sign of her now.
I saw you at the diner.
Wow, you are extremely observant.
Well, I go to Rosie's earlier.
There's nothing but friendly faces.
And this time, it's all different.
It's unusual to see, uh, so many
unfamiliar faces in these parts.
So you go to Rosie's
for dinner every night at 5:00?
You gonna make some kind
of smart remark about that, too?
Sorry. Can I ask you a question?
White Rivers... are you familiar with it?
White Rivers? Yeah.
I know it.
I just had to be certain.

Thanks.
There was one slight hitch.
Another civilian.
Not like the last one.
So everything was cleaned up?
You'd better get back here

Okay, Italy.
