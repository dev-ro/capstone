Hurry! Hurry!
This way! This way!
Wait for me!
Let's go!
Guts!
The prince of our world!
The unforgivable traitor.
Fear and trepidation,
praying for an audience.
Soon we will meet in our realm.
You are of our blood,
we have been waiting for you.
It appears to have been
spotted in Scheto.
By God...
These occurrences
are no coincidences.
These are omens of the end.
His Holiness has sent a mission to
find these phenomena and identify them.
Even the King's men are dispatched.
Advent
Advent
Advent
Don't be stubborn.
You're our commander
and you're tired.
I understand.
Rickert has returned.
Griffith's location has
been discovered.
Where?
Where!?
Be calm.
But...
We continue faring these hardships.
We've been trying to escape for a year.
We're exhausted.
Now, we can only wait
and see what is to come.
You should rest now.
Thank you.
Enemy attack!
They tailed you!
Nice dodge.
The rumors are true, the Band of the Hawk
has a skilled female commander.
Regardless of your gender,
all I need is your head, and the battle's over.
What!?
What are you!?
That's no ordinary soldier!
Caska!
The outcome has been decided.
Drop your weapon and
command your soldiers to surrender.
If you choose not to,
I'll take your head.
I'll count to three.
Choose.
One...
Two...
three!
Four.
Don't let that clown
get the better of you.
On your feet.
You command a thousand.
Guts!
What?!
The captain's back!
Come on.
Now's no time to be distracted.
Leave 'em to me.
Do your own work.
Go.
Stand back!
Don't interfere.
I'll kill this one myself.
This blade contains
the ancient power of my ancestors!
Damn!
FIRE!
We shall retreat for now.
Caska!
What!?
Griffith is...
Yeah.
It happened the day after you left.
Ha!
They hailed us as the saviors of Midland,
and the next morning, we were wanted criminals.
Yeah, and we can all forget about
becoming royalty.
Might not mean anything to you,
but I can not accept it.
I won't accept as my comrade someone
who wasn't there when we needed him.
Draw your sword.
Wait a minute!
I have no desire to
shed blood right now.
Hey!
Caska!
Don't mock me!
Draw your sword!
You haven't changed a bit, have you?
Explain yourself!
It's all your fault!
You ruined it all.
It's all your fault!
You ruined the Band of
the Hawk and Griffith both!
Me?
How?
Are you playing me for a fool?!
Griffith wanted only you!
You were the only one to
have ever been close to him!
You made him weak!
Griffith...
Griffith...
...needs you!
Impossible...
He's Griffith.
The Griffith I know...
Let go!
You're bleeding!
I...
...just stayed true to myself.
I did the same as Griffith.
I understand!
Let go, idiot!
I never managed to be
his blade or his woman.
To be honest, I knew.
There was never a gap
my presence could fill.
The reason I tried my utmost in spite of that
because I felt my life had no other meaning.
Caska...
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm...
so tired.
I leave the rest to you.
What the hell are you thinking?
Listen!
You're not going near another
cliff until doomsday!
I'm not gonna let myself
get pulled over the edge again!
You took everything I cherished from me.
I want to kill you.
Idiot.
What?
You always get hurt because of me.
You always end up shedding blood.
Idiot.
Hey.
Yes?
I wonder if you will leave us
after helping us save Griffith.
I'll save him, but...
Want to come with me?
What?
Come with me after we've freed Griffith.
I don't know what the future holds.
But...
we can leave together if
it doesn't trouble you.
Idiot.
From now on I want to
hold you hundreds of thousands of times.
That's what I think, anyways.
Idiot.
Don't call me an idiot,
I have feelings you know.
Hey, Caska!
Get up!
Caska!
I knew someone like you
would eventually appear.
Where?
I heard it behind me!
The hell do you want?
Remember your greatest struggle,
for it has yet to come.
Soon, a storm of death
will rage around you.
It's impossible for men to redeem themselves
once the storm of death appears.
But pay heed, struggling one.
Struggle, squirm and fight.
Against death, the only sword that
wills you is your struggle to survive.
Do not forget this.
Hey!
What do you mean?
Wait!
I'm impressed you found
this hidden passage.
We have someone inside.
It means we aren't the only ones
who'd like to see Griffith freed.
But the guardsâ€”
Are you the Band of the Hawk?
I've been waiting.
You really came.
Princess?
So...
So the insider is...
Yes.
It is I.
How deep is this damned hole?
A thousand or so years ago,
the land was embroiled in war and turmoil.
One rose to put an end to the chaos.
Emperor Gaiseric.
In his lifetime, he forged a vast empire
that spanned the entire continent.
His lineage remains a mystery,
but his skill at arms was famed,
and they say he always wore a skull mask to battle.
I've heard stories of
the legendary Skull King,
but he was mad with power,
so Five Angels were sent to deal with him.
This led to the elimination of
his army and the empire he'd built.
Wasn't it four?
What the hell do these fairy tales
have to do with the damned hole?
This is not a fairy tale!
This is history!
The bottom of this hellish pit
is all that remains of that empire.
Griffith?
Griffith!
Who's there?
Grif...
Griff... ith?
Griffith!
His tendons have been severed.
His tongue too!
Caska!
Keys!
Caska!
NO!
Stay back!
T-This can't be...
T-This cannot be Griffith...
Guts...
Y-You're trapped in here.
You're locked in.
Are you the one?
You did this to Griffith?
I never got to work on someone
so beautiful before.
He weathered torture so well.
First, I cut his tendons
so he wouldn't run away.
Then, when he wasn't sleeping or eating,
I tore off his skin and fingernails.
I branded him with glowing iron
and dumped boiling water on him.
We've been as close as
a married couple for the past year.
Look at what I have for my collection!
It's my charm.
His tongue, see?
Lying to you when
you're doomed already is a sin.
S-Stop!
Stop it.
Your breath stinks like shit.
You're going to hell.
Please!
Save...
save me!
I can't hear you.
Speak properly.
Freeze!
Drop your weapons and surrender!
Guts, where to?
Get...
Get him!
What are you doing?
Fire!
Let's go!
Don't leave him!
W-What's this?!
Griffith was rescued?
Do not let them go!
They absolutely can not escape!
They are few!
Caska!
Come here!
Sorry for the trouble.
It is an honor to serve
the saviors of my country.
Close the gates!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Don't let the traitors through!
Aim for their horses!
Fire!
Impossible!
Are they trying to break through?!
What the hell are you doing, idiot?
Hurry, hurry!
That was close.
Griffith...
We'll meet again, right?
Come, Princess.
It's the standing army!
50...
no, 100 men!
Strange...
they're lagging behind.
It's an ambush!
Damn!
We're trapped, Sister!
Get to the front!
Guts, Pippin,
I'll leave the rear to you!
They're enemies of the King!
They got a horse!
Ignore it!
The horse will be fine!
There's no end to them!
Damn!
Is this the end?
Did we make it?
Corkus!
I've always wanted to do this.
All right, you bastards!
All forces, ride on!
Wait for my command...
Cheers!
The world is ours now that
we have Griffith back!
The Band of the Hawk lives!
Once again,
we will earn victory after victory!
Want to ride with Tudor now?
Rattle Midland's cage a bit?
Sounds good!
Sorry.
I'll find some men
to take over for you.
No, you need to rest, Commander.
Haven't you been up all night?
You don't have to worry about me.
What's Griffith's status?
I'm not a doctor,
my specialty lies elsewhere.
Tell me.
Griffith...
isn't it hot in that?
You can take it off.
It's just the two of us.
Want to wear it?
That's so like you.
Nothing has changed.
Guess we're still on a battlefield.
No battle without plate and helmet.
The tendons in his hands
and feet have been severed.
He will never stand
or hold a sword again.
I see.
Judeau told me.
I see.
Hey, you must be joking.
This is Griffith we're talking about...
Fine.
Let's ask him.
It won't help.
Griffith can no longer speak.
What?
What's going on?
Really?
What the hell is this?!
Wasn't this going to be
only the beginning?
Weren't we going to
find glory under Griffith?
First they declare us traitors
for God knows what reason,
then we run and hide like rats for a year
while watching our comrades die off,
and finally, when we're convinced
we have Griffith back,
this is what we get?!
What now?
What will we do?
Is there nothing we can do?
Commander Casca!
The Band of the Hawk
hasn't been annihilated!
We can still rally under Casca!
Give me some time to think.
Our pursuers won't be able to
raise another force immediately.
I need more time to think.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you going
to think about?
What were you
going to tell the others?
Huh?
"Settle the war you started yourselves."
You're strong, aren't you?
Sometimes you can't settle something
precisely because you started it.
Would you say
the same to Griffith?
They're weak, so they need a leader
or a dream to rely on.
If someone loses
what they were relying on,
what can I do for them?
Console them?
Criticize them?
Be there for them?
It's so hard to keep the people you
care about around you happy.
In the end,
how do we go about this?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know either.
I'll take a look at Griffith.
Time to change your
bandages, Griffith.
So what are you going to do now?
Become a vagabond again?
Judeau...
Let's see.
I might take some guys
and turn bandit.
That should let you
take care of Griffith alone.
Take me with you.
You don't need the others anymore.
You should take Casca with you this time.
You have to take her with you this time.
She...
You...
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Ready to ditch us like before?
Just suddenly leave?
Then please, take us with you!
This is a unanimous decision
by the soldiers.
We're still up for a fight!
Whether we're mercenaries or thieves-
We just want to follow you!
Captain!
Please, Captain!
Captain!
Together, we're unstoppable!
While together, we all fight for
each other and the good of the group.
As long as we're with you,
we'll overcome any difficulties.
C'mon, please!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
- Captain!
- Captain!
Captain!
Please!
- Please!
- Captain!
- Captain!
- Captain!
Captain!
Rickert is riding ahead and looking
for a way across the border.
He said he knows someone in
the Calonia mountain range.
H-Hey?
It's strange, I thought...
I should be good at it, but...
I'm so useless.
S-Sorry.
I'll get you a blanket.
What?
Griffith!
Gri...
Relax.
Stop it!
Caska.
Guts.
How is he?
OK.
He's asleep now.
What happened to you?
No, nothing.
Hey, what happened?
I know something is wrong.
It's nothing.
What do you mean?
If it's nothing,
then you wouldn't be crying!
Something happened with Griffith?
Stop!
You're wrong!
I'm sorry.
I can't go.
What?
I...
I can not go with you.
Griffith has become so emaciated.
He's trembling.
He was such a proud man.
I cannot run away from him.
I just can't leave him alone.
Then I have to stay.
I have to stay in
the The Band of the Hawk.
Do you remember what happened
in the Prom Rose mansion?
Yes.
Then you know you need to go.
If you're his equal, his friend...
You need to go alone.
What are you scared of there?
Let's go.
I want to play some more.
The sun still has not set.
Griffith!
Griffith!!
What?
Did the horse get out of control?
Impossible!
I think Griffith heard us!
Impossible!
He can barely crawl!
Go and tell Judeau!
Right!
Lemme borrow this!
Damnit...
Damnit!
DAMN!
Yes, have I rested for too long.
I have to go now.
I'm not done playing.
That cobbled road through the houses
goes on yet.
What is it?
Hey!
That's...
Griffith!
Griffith!
Stay back.
Stay back!
What the...?
If you touch me now...
I'll never again...
Never again, will you...
What the...?!
What happened?
What's going on?
Where the hell are we?
What is this?
Where'd it come from?
We were just riding on the plains, right?
Hey!
Look at the ground!
This is impossible!
This has to be some horrible dream!
Calm down!
We don't understand!
Pay it no heed!
Focus on what you can do!
Circular defensive formation!
Now we're ready for any attack!
Judeau!
Corkus!
Gaston! Pippin!
This is some crazy shit.
Hurry up and ready your crossbows!
Hurry!
Go!
Griffith, can you stand?
Behelit...
You alright, Griffith?
It's time.
It's time.
It's time.
The glorious night of the festival!
Once in 216 years is this banquet held!
ECLIPSE!
Eclipse?!
W-What are they!?
They came out of thin air?!
Arise!
Arise!
Finally, they will arise!
They are our kings.
Arise!
Arise!
Come to us, king of the supernatural!
Behold the advent of
the four guardian angels!
Oh, Lady Slan!
Lady Slan!
What the hell...?
What the...
God...?
No, demons?
I bid thee all welcome.
Many mortals gathered to sacrifice themselves,
veritable lambs of God.
On this night of the holy festival!
Please, enjoy our presence.
The Hawk has been selected
as the child of God.
You have been chosen.
At this moment,
this land is our domain.
The God Hand has descended.
We are the Kindred,
blessed kings of longing.
Kindred?
But...
Chosen? Griffith?
He's the same as them?
Don't fuck with me.
Don't fuck with me!
Guts...
The child of God?
Kindred?
Shut the fuck up about this nonsense!
We've all seen this guy naked!
He's got no tail, nothing!
What exquisite friendship.
You'll make a fantastic sacrifice.
Sacrifice?
Yes.
Give yourself to him, and let yourself
be a stepping stone to his glory!
He is the one with
the Crimson Behelit.
He now has the potential
to be a demon king.
That is the Egg of the High King,
which allows reincarnation as a guardian angel,
a member of the God Hand.
You who have gathered are important sacrifices
to consecrate his advent.
I'm dreaming.
I know I'm dreaming.
These fucking monsters want Griffith
to become like them?!
You'll have us sacrifice ourselves for it?
You're a bit mistaken.
His own will shall do the deed.
He will offer you as the sacrifices.
This can't be possible.
There's no way he'll do that!
The flow of casualty takes
everything within it.
Your fates will now be decided.
Rise to the altar child of God!
Guts!
Griffith!
Are you afraid?
Is one such as yourself
afraid of the netherrealm?
Do you fear us horrible entities?
Or do you fear your future as one?
Before facing your future,
you must witness your past
to know what kind of person...
...you are.
My, my...
you're really boisterous about it all.
What are you shouting about?
But, old lady,
all these people are dead!
Weren't you the one who killed them?
None of them would have died had you
not claimed to be on your way to the castle.
But I didn't force anybody...
Silence!
You should have known from the start.
You should have known what kind of
place you'd come to.
Known?
Indeed.
The only way to have reached that castle
was by paving a road of corpses.
Fail to trample them under your foot
and you shall join them.
I...
I'm...
You're such an idiot.
Now you regret what you
once thought was a good idea.
Just looking at the castle from the alleyway
couldn't satisfy you, could it?
Yes.
I understand quite well.
However...
I cannot apologize.
No, I will not apologize.
Should I apologize or feel regret?
Everything would have been for naught.
I will never reach the castle if I do.
Yes, that is your mind.
Was that a phantasm?
It was no phantasm.
That was the truth
as your mind constructed it!
To reach Heaven's shining castle,
you erected a mountain of corpses.
That is you.
And now...
you have a dead end road.
But, everyone...
with the Band of the Hawk is still yours.
It's all you have...
at the end of your bloody journey...
so that you yourself may live on.
Live on in the ruins of your dream.
Ruins of my dreams?
Add them to the mountain;
add all that you have left.
And in order to reach that castle,
all you must say is...
"Sacrifice them."
Do so, and you shall be like wings of raven
gliding through the heavens!
Griffith!
Yes...
We were partners,
against thousands of enemies.
You're the only one...
...who made me forget my dream.
Sacrifice them.
Griffith!
Griffith!
He is bound now,
by the laws of causality.
The promised time has come.
Now engraved upon your bodies,
is the Mark of the Sacrifice!
The imprint is engraved for all eternity,
until the last drop of your blood is spilt.
Dying with the last vestiges
of your grievances,
you will become food for
the newborn child of darkness.
Pippin!
Run!
Move!
Run! Run!
Get out now!
What are you saying?!
What are you doing?!
Judeau, let me go!
Pippin!
Pippin!!
Take me back, Judeau!
Do you want to just leave them?
No!
You're our general now!
You have to live.
As long as the general lives,
The Band of the Hawk will not end!
I won't let it end like this!
We will fight to the end!
Wasn't this the rendezvous point?
You finally showed yourself.
For thousands of years,
we've been rivals.
I was never quite sure
you would use this chance.
I see you have been
appointed gatekeeper, Immortal.
I take no interest in
your mindless banter.
Surely you understand,
my ancient "friend."
It's a dream, just a dream.
This is just one hell of a nightmare.
I'm just blacked out drunk
in a bar I frequented.
Damn, someone hurry and wake me.
Judeau, Pippin, Rickert...
You're sitting next to me, right?
Hey, come on!
Well, I'm never one to
turn down a woman in need!
Please, don't wake me now.
Damn...
Why do I...
Wait for me, Griffith.
I'll save you!
Do not hinder me!
Why do you keep on saying
that you'll save him?
When he made this decision.
Did you not hear him?
This was his intent all along.
Shut the fuck up!
He'd never do this!
Griffith is my...
My...!
Judeau!
Judeau!
Get out of the way, idiot!
You'll die!
Why?
Caska...
Did my knife hit?
Yeah!
You nailed him!
Get out of here.
What are you saying?
You told me that
we'd fight till the end!
Live up to those words!
Get up!
You're a lot more slender than Guts.
Keep that talk to yourself.
It's all I am.
Talk.
You tend to talk too much.
Really...
I thought I was more useful than this.
Judeau, I couldn't do anything...
Where am I?
Their deaths are flowing through me.
I feel nothing.
My memories are slowly overflowing.
Why...?
Why do men...
I see...
So that's why...
Anyone alive?
Are they all dead?!
Caska!
Judeau!
Pippin!
Corkus!
Soldiers!
Answer me!
Gaston!
Pippin!
Pippin!
You're still alive!
Pippin!
Bastards...
You Bastards!!!
Celebrate his birth!
The five blessed kings have assembled.
He is the new demon king!
We bestow unto thee,
a new name fit for a demon king!
Femto, the Wings of Darkness!
Femto
Griff...
Why are you...?!
What are you doing you asshole?!
Griffith?
How foolish.
What could a mere mortal possibly do?
He has surpassed his human form.
Don't watch...
Beautiful...
It might move me to tears.
Love, hate, agony, pleasure,
life and death.
All of it is right there.
It is so human,
and yet so demonic!
Fascinating.
This is unexpected.
Nothing is ever perfect.
After all, we are not God himself.
Pray say, Void.
Was this, too, preordained?
Caska!?
Guts!?
Either way, this is
the dawn of a new age.
The fifth angel has been born.
An age of darkness will dawn.
The vastness of the dark
will drive away the light.
Men will call it thus:
The Dark Age.
Where are all of you going?
Judeau!
Hey, stop!
Don't go!
Corkus!
Pippin!
Stop!
Come back!
DON'T GO!
Guts!
You finally woke up.
Rickert...?
Thank goodness!
I'd almost given you up.
You haven't moved at all in four days.
Where are we?
In the mountains, where we live.
The place is called Couldaut.
Guts, what happened in
the eye of the storm?
Storm?
Hey, what happened to freeing Griffith?
How did you get those wounds?
Where is everyone?
Hey, what happened?!
Caska!
Where's Caska?!
C-Caska...
Well...
Caska-Onee chan is over there.
Caska!
It's me.
Guts!
No!
Hey, stop joking around!
It's over, Caska!
We made it out alive!
Caska?
There, there.
What a scary Onii-chan, isn't he?
Don't do that, Guts.
You're badgering her.
She doesn't remember.
She doesn't remember you or me.
She's been like this
ever since she woke up.
There, there.
It's alright.
Yes.
That's right, there-there.
It looks weird, doesn't it?
Bastard!
It's all your fault.
Draw your sword!
Idiot.
What is this?
Stop!
Stop!
Don't give in!
Otherwise they
will possess and kill you.
The Mark of the Sacrifice...
The Brand will attract dark minions.
Your body, down to
the last drop of blood,
is sacrificed to the dark minions.
That is the fate of those
branded with the Mark,
you who struggles so valiantly.
In short, this is another battle.
It is no different from
any other battle.
No different!
You must surely take Casca with you.
Ha!
There he is, the brainless butcher.
If you're his equal, his friend...
You need to go alone.
Who is that?
Who is crying?
Tears?
I shed them...
They are my last.
