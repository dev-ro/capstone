SUBTITLES BY LUIS-SUBS
- Come on, come on.
- Okay, all right.
Will you hurry up?
I'm home.
Afternoon, Miss Edna.
Penny, your mother called.
Tracy Turnblad, can't you
say hello to Mrs. Malinski?
Mm, mm, mm.
Every day she's got to watch that
Corny Collins Show.
Delinquents, if you ask me.
It ain't right to be dancing
on TV to that colored music.
- She's just a teenager.
- Hmph.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Malinski.
- Goodbye, Edna.
Mashed Potato
Feel it in your feet now
Mashed Potato
Come on get the beat now
Baby, come on honey,

Could you turn that racket down?
I'm trying to iron in here.
They found this dance
was outta sight
Doin' the lion sleeps tonight
Mashed Potato
Woo, yeah
Ladies and gentlemen,
Corny Collins.
Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome
to The Corny Collins Show.
That was Dee Dee Sharp
and today's...
Thwip. ...Bull's-eye hit,
"Mashed Potato Time."
We've got our first
telegram of the day.
Thank you very much, Tammy.
"Please have Lou Ann Levorowski
and I.Q. Jones lead a dance."
Signed, "your number one fan
in West Baltimore."
Here they come.
Come up here, kids.
- Hi, Corny.
- Hi, West Baltimore.
You're a groovy chick. How long have
you been a regular on the show?
I've been on the
Council for five months.
And you, I.Q.?
Two out-of-sight years.
Heh, not bad.
God, he's gorgeous, Penny.
- Look at her hair.
- Aah!
Gosh, I wish mine was that high.
And what's your favorite
record from the survey?
"Gravy."
All right, here's I. Q. Jones
and Lou Ann Levorowski...
leading our next dance,
Give Me Gravy on my Mashed Potatoes.
I need gravy
Give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
I knew you danced
The mashed potato fine
But that don't show me
That you're really mine
What's with dancin'
Without romancin'?
So put that somethin'
extra on the line
Give me gravy
On my mashed potatoes
Give me gravy
Come on and treat me right
Give me gravy
You're the greatest
So give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
Link, tell the home viewers
where we'll be tonight.
Well, Corny, we'll be
at the Parkville VFW.
For the Corny Collins Record Hop.
Stuck-up little spastic.
She's such a queer.
Parkville VFW, 8:00.
What do you want to hear, Amber?
"Shake a Tail Feather"
by The Five Du-Tones.
Here they are, The Five Du-Tones.
I heard about the fella
You've been dancin' with
All over the neighborhood
So why didn't you ask me, baby?
Or didn't you think I could?
I know that the Bossa Nova's
Outta sight
I've seen him do
the Bird all night
But, if that was you and me
Out there, baby
I would have shown you
How to do it right
Do it right
Bend over
Let me see you shake a tail feather
Twistin'! Shake-it, shake-it, shake-it
Shake-it, baby
You should be on
that council, not her.
I know I should, Penny.
Hey, I'm going to that hop tonight.
Oh, let me come. We'll lie and say
we're going to the library to study.
- It's a deal, heh.
- Heh.
- We'll meet 8:00, up on the avenue.
- Heh.
Okay, young ladies. I've had just
about enough of this screeching music.
Mother, we're watching
The Corny Collins Show.
Penny,
your mother called all frantic.
She said you are punished.
I'm always punished.
And Tracy, I have told
you about that hair...
all ratted up like
a teenage Jezebel.
Oh, Mother,
you're so '50s.
Tracy's flamboyant flip
is all the rage, Miss Edna.
Jackie Kennedy, our first lady,
even rats her hair.
But Tracy ain't no
first lady, are you, Tracy?
No, sirree, she's a hairhopper.
That's what she is.
Now, I've got nothing but
hampers of ironing to do...
and my diet pill is wearing off.
Tracy, I want you to go
to your room and study.
And Penny,
don't you be listening...
to every bit of nonsense
my daughter tells you.
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear she was mental.
Now what? More soiled laundry
for Mommy, I suppose.
Come in.
Edna, have you seen Penny?
Good Lord, Prudy,
she's right over there.
Hi, Mom.
Penny Pingleton,
you know you were punished.
From now on, you're wearing a giant P
on your blouse every day to school...
so that the whole world knows that
Penny Pingleton is permanently...
positively punished.
Eight o'clock.
- Bye, Miss Edna.
- Bye, honey.
I said no.
- Oh, stop. Stop, unh.
- What is it? What is it?
Unh, oh, my God.
- Amber, what's the matter?
- No, get off of me.
- Don't look at me.
- Whoa, what's the matter? Amber.
What's the matter?
I happen to have a blemish.
You had three good
close-ups today, period.
Why can't you dance up front
where the voters can see you?
Leave me alone, Mother.
I have a pimple.
Heh, you had to choose a colored
record as your favorite song?
That's nice for the neighbors.
You got something against
Connie Francis?
Shelley Fabares?
- I love Shelley Fabares.
- Oh.
Amber, Amber.
Are you listening to me?
We have to have a little talk.
You know, if your father is
forced to integrate Tilted Acres...
we're out of business.
So at least act
white on television.
Leave me alone, Mother.
"Shake a Tail Feather"
is a wild song.
It's got a good beat
and you can dance to it.
Oh, God, of all nights.
A Corny Collins record hop,
and I've got craters.
Unh, just pop it. Pop it.
Just relax. Relax.
Don't be ridiculous.
Take it easy.
Tension is the worst thing
for a complexion.
Come on. Lie down. Lie down.
No moping.
Mother is here.
You have beautiful skin, Amber.
There. It's gone.
Now it's time for you-know-what
Mother, I know all the dances.
Come on. Get up. Get up.
- Practice makes perfect.
- Ugh.
I ought to know.
Don't forget, I was
Miss Soft Crab in 1945.
And that title wasn't handed to me
on a silver platter. I worked for it.
Now come on. A one, two,
a one, two, three, pony.
Mash potatoes.
Faster.
Amber, I'd like to talk to you.
Yes, Daddy?
Don't stop. Cha-cha.
- I'm tired.
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.
One, two, cha-cha-cha.
I had some new campaign fliers made up
today, all for Daddy's little girl.
Now, I want you to hand those out
at the hop tonight to everyone.
Each and every one of those.
- Twist.
- Oh, Daddy, ugh.
No lip from you, Miss ingrate.
This campaign is costing us
an arm and a leg.
New gowns,
hairdresser three times a week.
Your hairspray bill alone is enough to eat
up all the profits from the Tilt-A-Whirl.
Do as Daddy says or we'll send you
to Catholic school where you belong.
- Right, Franklin?
- That's right. Catholic school.
Pass the macaroni
and cheese, please.
Did you take that appetite suppressant
I gave you on Dr. McKenzie's orders?
Mother, I'm a growing teenager.
I need food.
Let her eat, Edna.
Tracy, did you do your chores
around the house today?
Not Miss Tracy,
Cyd Charisse herself.
She's too busy ratting her hair
and doing the Ubangi stomp.
Tracy, we all have
responsibilities in life.
You may think owning the Hardy
Har joke shop is all drudgery...
unwrapping dribble glasses,
checking doggie doo inventory...
but I love it.
You'll see. Work can be fun.
Can I please be excused to go
to the library to study?
Let's have a ball
at the hall tonight
Boot it girl till
the early bright
Make a scene with the record machine
At the dancin' party tonight
Come on let's try
mashed potatoes too
What's the problem, officer?
- This is a white establishment.
- Oh, come on.
Hey, listen,
we just came to dance.
- That's not fair.
- Open your purse, please.
And everything's all right
Go. Go.
Mess around, Bristol Stompin' too
Pony now like it's all brand new
Any dance that you wanna do
Boys and girls, stay on the dance floor.
Here comes the hottest tune of the day.
And it started right
here in Baltimore.
And where did you
see it first, kids?
The Corny Collins Show.
A big strong line, ladies and
gentlemen. It's "Madison Time."
I can do that dance.
It's Madison time, hit it
You're lookin' good
A big strong line
When I say hit it I want you
to go two up and two back
With a big strong turn
and back to the Madison
Hit it
No, you dance better than
all of them. Go ahead. Go.
You're lookin' good
Now when I say hit it I want
you to go two up and two back
Double cross
Come out of it with the rifleman
Hit it
Crazy
Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong "M"
Erase it,
and back to the Madison
Hit it
Walk on, you're lookin' good
Now then when I say hit it
It'll be "T" time
Hit it
Big strong line
Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong basketball
With the Wilt Chamberlain hook
Hit it
Two points
Now this time when I say hit it
I want the big strong Jackie Gleason
And back to the Madison
Hit it
And away we go
Crazy
When I say hit it, go two up
and two back double cross and freeze
Hit it
And hold it right there
All right. Hold on to your hats,
all you continental rockers...
because it's dance contest time,
and we've got the wildest judge in town.
You listen to her every night on WEDD
and she hosts Negro Day...
on The Corny Collins Show.
The last Thursday of every month.
A warm welcome for the queen
of Baltimore soul...
Miss Motormouth Maybelle herself,
ladies and gentlemen.
Let's hear it, Baltimore.
Motormouth Maybelle.
All right, here she comes,
looking very fine.
Ooh, wee, tiddley papa,
I am a whopper.
Motormouth Maybelle is my name
and, sweetheart, dancing is my game.
Motormouth, Motormouth,
Motormouth.
All right.
Chubby Checker and "Pony Time."
Hey now let's party
In the union hall
It's pony time
When you hear this call
So get with it
Don't quit it
Get up
Okay, fatso, let's see

With a big boss line
Well anyway you do it
You're gonna look real fine

So get with it
Don't quit it
All right.
All right, Motormouth,
just three couples left.
Tammy,
bring on the applause meter.
Is it going to be
couple number one?
Or is it couple number two?
Or shall it be couple
number three?
All right.
I think we have a winner.
And that winner is...
I love them tender,
Tracy and Fender.
All right.
Tracy Turnblad and Fender.
Tracy Turnblad, you are the
queen of the hop tonight.
We hold auditions for the Council
tomorrow. Come down, strut your stuff.
Oh, Corny, do you really think
I'm good enough?
What do you think, Kids?
Yeah!
I hear you. Thanks for coming down,
Tracy. We'll see you tomorrow.
Now, Motormouth, I think it's time
we slowed things down a little...
with Mr. Gene Pitney.
You can't hide your face
in this godforsaken place.
Here in your own city,
there's a town without pity, heh.
Gene Pitney,
ladies and gentlemen.
When you're young and so and love
As we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know
What a town without pity can do
Whore.
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds
tear you in two
What a town without pity can do
No, it isn't very pretty
What a town without pity can do
Hey, diddily da
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on and make a line
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily dee
Oh, yeah, you're looking fine
Continental, continental
Come on
Let's go
It's continental time
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily doo
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
This dance is all brand new
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily doo
Aha, it's such a ball to do
Continental, continental
Thank you, girls.
And now it's time to move on to a
little something we call the spotlight.
Okay. First girl, Miss Pingleton?
Uh, I'm just a little nervous.
This is show business, young lady.
If you think you're
nervous now, ha.
Wait till you're on the air.
Okay, first question?
Are you now, or have
you ever gone steady?
Well, I'm not going with anybody now,
but I'd love to date a Council Member.
- Pfft. She wishes.
- Yeah, right.
Come on.
Exactly how many
sweaters do you have?
Gee, I never counted.
I guess about five.
Five?
Next.
Nadine Carver,
Eastern High School.
Are you aware Negro Day is the
last Thursday of every month?
Yes, I've been on it a few times.
I feel the show should be
integrated every day.
Can you relate
to Lesley Gore's music?
Look, she ain't no James Brown...
but I can dance to
Lawrence Welk if I have to.
Lawrence Welk?
Thank you, Nadine.
Tracy Turnblad.
Would you do a pimple cream
commercial on camera...
if Corny asked you to?
I'd be proud to.
Luckily, I've never been cursed
with acne like others.
But I realize the devastating
effect of skin blemishes...
on the social life of teenagers.
Would you ever, heh, swim in
an integrated swimming pool, heh?
Oh, my God.
- I certainly would, Iggy.
- Heh.
I'm a modern kind of girl.
I'm all for integration.
Ugh, aren't you a little fat
for the show?
That's enough, Amber.
I would imagine that many home viewers
are also pleasantly plump or chunky.
Oh, come on. The show's
not filmed in CinemaScope, heh.
You're out of line, Amber.
- Ow.
- Corny, Tammy, can't you see?
- This girl's a trash can.
- That's five demerit points.
You're suspended from the show today.
Pack your things. Go home.
Oh, my God.
- I was supposed to lead ladies' choice.
- I'm sure we can find a replacement.
- Yes, Corny.
- Please, wait outside.
The Council will now meet in secret,
debate your personality flaws...
and come to a final decision.
Miss Edna!
Miss Edna!
Penny Pingleton,
you'll wake the dead.
Tracy's not home yet.
Plus your mother called
and she's on the warpath.
I know, Miss Edna.
Can I come in?
Oh, there's something
you have gotta see.
Well, yeah, come on up...
but I've got ironing
and Wilbur's working.
Mr. Turnblad!
It's not war with Cuba, is it?
- Or more Negro problems?
- No, you'll see.
Did poor Debbie Reynolds
have a nervous breakdown?
This better be good.
Broad daylight and I'm sitting
in front of a TV.
I've seen The Corny Collins Show.,
thank you.
- Just watch.
- I just lost a $2.69 Silly Putty sale.
- This better be worth it.
- Wait, you'll see. Just watch.
- What's your name?
- I'm Ruby.
- And you?
- Dee Dee.
- What about you?
- I'm Lucille.
Where will you
be appearing tonight?
We'll be at the Royal Theater.
- At Motormouth Maybelle
- All soul review.
All right, ladies and gentlemen...
a big hand for Baltimore's
own Trinklettes.
I closed up shop for this?
Just wait.
Let's keep the music playing...
and the hits a-turning
with Mr. Gene Chandler...
because the Duke of Earl
loves to cha-cha.
There, there. Look.
It's Tracy.
Oh, my God.
She's all peroxided up.
I'll be damned. Tracy's on TV.
With a triple process, yet.
But Tracy was accepted
on the Corny Collins Council.
Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad,
your daughter's a star.
And you, you are my girl
And no one can hurt you, oh, no
See? She's already
getting close-ups.
Does she get paid for this?
- Big as a house.
- I think she looks pretty, Edna, heh.
Hello.
Uh, yes, I'm watching her now.
You are? Well, thank you, heh.
Yes. Good bye.
That was Hilda
from up Conklin Street.
She's going to send a telegram.
Oh, God, there she is.
Nothing can stop me, now
'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's time to introduce someone
very special.
A new Council Member making
her first appearance on the show...
and we already have telegrams.
Introduce yourself.
Hi, Corny. I'm Tracy Turnblad
and I go to Mervel High.
Well, someone out there likes you.
"Please, have the new girl
lead a ladies' choice."
I was supposed to lead
the ladies' choice.
- Tell me, Tracy, are you going steady?
- No, I'm not.
But there is somebody
I've got a crush on.
Who, I'd like to know?
She's just a child.
Well, let's see who
the lucky guy is.
Ladies and gentlemen,
a ladies' choice.
Hi, Tracy. It's me, Penny.
She can't hear you.
She better hadn't dare.
If you should lose me
Oh, yeah
You'll lose a good thing
If you should lose me
Oh, yeah
You'll lose a good thing
You know I love you
Do anything for you
Ugh, oh, God. He's violated the
oath of the friendship ring.
Oh, don't cry, honey.
You'll lose a good thing
I'm givin' you one more chance
For you to do right
If you'll only straighten up
We'll have a good life
That fat girl's no competition.
White trash, plain and simple.
For all we know,
that girl could be high yellow.
Oh, Mommy, Daddy, I'll still be
the queen of the auto show, won't I?
Oh, honey.
Tracy!
Tracy.
No, she's not here.
Well, I'm sure she loves you too.
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.
This is amazing.
She's so popular already.
She could be one of
The June Taylor Dancers.
Hello.
Well, yes,
I am Tracy Turnblad's agent.
Give me a pencil. Quick, quick.
How may I help you?
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Here's Tracy.
Oh, Tracy, you were wonderful.
- Honey, we're real proud of you.
- We'll be there.
Oh, sweetie, listen.
Tomorrow, get up just a bit
closer so we can see you better.
And maybe even give the Hardy
Har a little p-p-p plug, heh.
Oh, Mom, Dad.
Oh, Penny, my best friend.
I'm so happy.
Finally all of Baltimore knows,
I'm big, blond and beautiful.
You're a teen leader now.
And the show biz offers
are pouring in.
Tonight we have an audition.
Honey, this is only the beginning.
Stick with me and we'll
claw our way to the top.
Oh, God.
Fame, fortune, glamour.
And to top it off...
- ...I'm in love.
- Oh.
Wow, Tracy, you're really tough.
Oh, ooh, Tracy, what do
you think about this one?
- I like it.
- Oh.
Wilbur would kill us
if we spent that much.
You look gorgeous, Bertha.
Simply exquisite.
- Oh, I don't know, Pinky.
- Have an éclair.
Oh.
Eat up, girls. Eat up.
Big is beautiful.
Tracy Turnblad.
Welcome to the Hefty Hideaway house
of fashion for the ample woman.
- Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky.
- Hi.
Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business
manager, Edna Turnblad.
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet the both of you.
Here, we cater to big-boned gals
like yourself who are stylish...
and at the same time frustrated
by the lack of sizes in stores today.
I saw you on TV.
I want you to be my model.
Would, uh...?
Would she be paid for this?
One free outfit a month.
You start tomorrow. I hope
there's no diets in the works...
because I want to design your Miss
Auto Show coronation gown myself.
Could, uh, could you throw a pair of
complimentary pettipants in the deal?
You drive a hard bargain,
Miss Edna, and rightfully so.
Pettipants, pettigirdle,
you just let Tracy take her pick.
How about a fabulous
frock just for me?
Tracy has to work one
extra day for free.
It's a deal.
- Thank you, Mr. Pinky.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I'm going to make you a star.
I hope your father likes this.
He'll love it. You look beautiful.
It's the new you.
Oh, mom, come on. Come on.
- Go in the beauty shop?
- Yes.
- You haven't done that in years.
- No, ha, ha.
- Come on. You deserve it.
- No, Wilbur will kill me.
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.
- You really think I should?
- Yes.
Come on, Mom.
- Mama, welcome to the '60s.
- Heh.
- I'll talk to you after biology.
- See you after PE, guys.
In the figure shown, line
segment AB and line segment CD...
are chords of the circle.
Line segment PA
and line segment PC...
What is the problem, Mr. Davis?
I can't see through her hair.
I can't help it if he's short.
Your ratted hair is preventing yet
another student's geometry education.
It's feathered, not ratted.
Whatever you call it,
it's a hair-don't.
You've been warned repeatedly.
I want you to take a little walk
down to the principal's office.
Let's see what he has to say.
Anyway, she was right in the car...
in plain sight of
just everybody at the hop.
She was nude.
- No.
- That fat thing?
Tracy Turnblad is a whore.
Happy now?
- But, Mom, I didn't do...
- Don't "but, Mom" me.
- I didn't. He's lying. Ow!
- You are suspended.
- What was that for?
- Give you something to whine about.
Miss Turnblad?
Have a seat.
Yes, sir.
Once again, your hairdo
is getting you in hot water.
Didn't two weeks in hairdo
detention have any effect?
Uh, I happen to be the
height of teen fashion.
You're on a one-way ticket
to reform school.
Well, I'm afraid we're just going
to have to change your homeroom.
Starting today, you report
to class 10-D, room 108.
Special ed?
Yes, Miss Turnblad,
special education.
- But that's for retards.
- Mm.
And the black kids
you try to hold back.
Here, you will be taught
by specialists...
trained to deal with hairdo
scofflaws in high-school society.
Mr. Davidson.
That will be all, Miss Turnblad.
The city of Baltimore
has an interesting Catholic history.
It was named after Lord Baltimore.
He founded the Maryland
colony for Catholics...
and others who could not practice
their religion in England.
Hey, don't touch my stuff.
I'll kick your ass.
Take it back.
Teach us how to dance, honey.
Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go...
Good morning, class.
Good morning, Mrs. Shipley.
Now let's all stand and say
the Pledge of Allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag...
of the United States of America.
And one and two and three and four.
Let's warm it up.
And one and two...
Come on, Amber.
Can't we just be friends?
You're acting like a child.
Here we go with jumping jacks.
Let's go.
And one and two and three...
Now, as you all know...
today is special education's turn
at the dodgeball tournament.
Aw!
So let's get into the locker room,
put on those gym outfits...
and show them that special education
is nothing to laugh about.
And three and four.
Looking good.
Look, it's special ed.
This is special ed?
Special ed in the red!
All right, ladies, let's go.
Let's play dodgeball.
Penny, they put me in special ed
just because of my hair.
Hey, I saw you on
The Corny Collins Show.
Where'd a white girl learn
to dance like that?
Just practicing.
Oh, and watching Negro Day
on Corny Collins.
Hey, Thunder Thighs,
this one's for you.
Grow up, Amber.
Mama says Negro Day
ain't nothing but segregation.
- Your mama?
- Yeah.
None other than Motormouth
Maybelle herself.
I'm Seaweed.
Hey, Penny, see the colored boy,
the cute one?
His mother is Motormouth Maybelle.
He's gorgeous.
I'll get the fat retard.
- Game over! Let's hit the showers.
- Tracy?
Tracy?
Did you see that?
Tracy?
You're all right, girl.
- Are you sure she's all right?
- Yeah.
She'll be okay.
It's not who wins.
It's how you play the game.
Tracy,
would you go steady with me?
Uh-huh.
Come on, everybody
Clap your hands
Now you're looking good
I'm gonna sing my song
It won't take long
We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this
Come on let's twist again
Like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Yeah, round and round
And up and down we go again
Oh, baby let me know
You love me so
And then twist again
Like we did last summer
Girl, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Four, three, two, one.
You're on the air.
Fatty, fatty, 2-by-4, can't get
through the dressing room door?
Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky, owner of the
Hefty Hideaway, 3311 Eastern Avenue.
Are you big-boned, got a glandular
problem, but still want glamour?
Don't worry about it.
The Hefty Hideaway has got it all.
This beautiful ensemble,
being modeled by our lovely Tracy...
is available in sizes 12 to 26.
You heard me right.
You need a girdle? We got them.
Even got large-size shoes for
that continental Clementine look.
Oh, my darling
All at prices you can afford.
Big is beautiful.
Hefty Hideaway, Eastern Avenue.
Come on in today.
You'll be awful glad you did.
- That's our little baby.
- Ugh.
She's prettier than
Elizabeth Taylor.
Thank you. It's, uh, a thrill
to have you as a new sponsor.
And Tracy, you keep this up and you just
may be crowned Miss Auto Show 1963.
Remember,
tomorrow is Preteen Day...
so bring your little brother
or little sister...
or cousins or nieces or nephews
and let those tykes rock'n 'roll on...
The Corny Collins Show.
I've never been to North Avenue.
Don't worry.
Seaweed gave me the directions.
Oh, my God! It's Tracy!

Oh, that's so sweet.
Thank you.
Penny! Hurry up. Hurry up.
I gotta go. Thank you. Penny!

Tracy Turnblad.
You're my favorite dancer
on Corny Collins.
I'm L'il Inez, Seaweed's sister.
Well, it's nice to meet you,
L'il Inez.
Uh, this is my best friend Penny.
Link you probably know from the show.
Wow, you guys really came.
Hey, everybody.
This is Tracy,
the baddest white dancer in town.
And this is Link.
This is Penny.
No matter what you heard...
we are gonna teach the white
children how to do the Bird.
Right. Come on. Come on. Watch.

Hey, Miss White Lady.
Hey, can you spare me a quarter,
so I can buy me a taste?
Somebody, please, help me.
Here, here. Take it all.
- Take it. Take it all.
- Uh...
Please, don't hurt me. Please.
Why, thank you.
Thank you kindly.
- Help.
- Ha-ha-ha!
No, no, no.
Oh, oh, oh!
- Officer.
- Yes, ma'am? Can I help you?
Let's get together tonight
And play some hide and go seek
Let's play some hide and go seek
Let's go
Ooh, the dirty boogie.
Well, I love you
Love you, love you
Tickle, tickle
Hug me, hug me, hug me
- You all hid?
- Yeah!
If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat
Bahh
- Are you ready?
- I'm not ready
Aw, man, let's hide this time
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting
- Who all hid?
- Yeah
If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat
Bahh
Two bars of washing powder
Two bars of soap
Already hid, you better holler
Billy goat
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe wasn't hurting
Walk, don't jump
To the bottom of the well
Swam by the devil and he
I'm not gonna say that
- Who all hid?
- Yeah
If you ain't hid, you better
holler Billy goat
Bahh
Don't anybody come near me.
I'm armed, and I'm prepared
to protect myself.
Oh, God, Mother.
I know you were snatched, Penny,
and I've come to save you.
Oh, Papa Tuney, we got a loony.
Don't you try any of your voodoo
spells on me, you native woman.
We're just dancing.
Mrs. Pingleton, stop acting crazy.
These are our friends.
Don't act ignorant,
Tracy Turnblad.
- Come on, Penny.
- Mother.
Come on. Run. Run.
Run for your life!
Don't push, please. Don't push.
Settle down. It's hot. Please.
If you'll just stay still,
you won't be so hot...
You're gonna do terrific, all right?
Oh, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
Come on come on
And do the fly with me
Hey, come on everybody
And do the fly with me
Well if you don't know how to do it
Just watch and see
You've gotta shake your hands
All around
Right over here.
And then you buzz around the floor
You can do it if you really try
All the girls and the guys
Tracy! Aah! Tracy!
What the hell?
What are they doing here?
Look what she's wearing.
Hurry up, but watch your step.
Hurry, but watch your step.
- You all together?
- Yeah.
Sorry, Preteen Day is a white-only show.
Negro Day is the end of the month.
- You can come in or get out of the line.
- You're gonna turn this little girl away?
I don't make the rules.
You gonna come in...?
Aren't you aware of the Supreme
Court ruling on segregation?
What are you talking about? I just want
you to either come in or don't come in.
- I have a dream.
- You heard the man.
- You're holding up the line.
- Segregation never! Integration now!
Cut it out. Knock it off.
Segregation never!
Integration now!
Come here. Come here.
Hold them. All right.
- All right.
- Integration now! Segregation never!
Okay, you little tykes.
We got a real treat in store for you.
A local group with a big hit record.
Let's have a warm welcome,
come on, for the Lafayettes.
- Mother.
- Go on. What are you waiting for?
Well, life's too short
And you're too sweet
Every day of your life, child
You've got to spend with me
Now let me tell you about Sally
She's a-really tough
And girl you know about Emmy
There's some trouble outside. A little
black girl who wants to be on the show.
- Well, let her in, for God sakes.
- The station management says no.
She's with agitators. I'm afraid
demonstration's in the works.
Okay,
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Where are you going?
- Wait, I gotta go.
- You're a teen helper. You can't go.
You can't change the world's
problems in one day.
A-no no, a-no no
I, I keep a-tellin' you
Aah, I
I said I told a-you baby
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
- Please, sit down and stop this, please.
- Hey, you.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.
- Is your daughter mulatto?
- Why, you...
- Look at this.
- How dare you call my daughter mulatto?
Tracy. Tracy, come back here.
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Two, four, six...!
A-hey-hey
A-hey-hey
A-hey-hey
Now, kids, we're gonna get
real lovey-dovey.
One of your favorite records
and one of mine too.
Lesley Gore, sing your heart out.
Can I, uh, have this dance?
Sure.
What difference does it make,
Mr. Hodgepile? One little black girl?
Who are you, the NAACP?
But it's an easy way
to integrate without trouble.
Absolutely not.
Baltimore is not ready
for integrated dancing.
And don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
'Cause you don't own me
Don't try to change me
Ew!
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Aah! That's the fuzz!
That's it for today, kids.
See you tomorrow at 3:00,
live at Tilted Acres.
I'm blue
I wanna tell all you people
I dropped a penny in the well
Hopin' you would come back soon
I couldn't believe what I heard
A fortune teller told me
My love with you was through
I hope her reading was wrong
I hope she was wrong
'Cause you been gone too long
- Come home
- Hey!
Black Baltimore, your mother
is ready to show her might...
and fight, fight, fight.
Yeah!
All right, now. After school,
you know where to go.
Tilted Acres, for the show.
Segregation? No, no, no!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
All right, now. I want to
introduce you to my main man.
I'm his biggest fan.
All the way from Louisiana...
just to see me,
the big mamma jamma.
Now, I want a ball in this hall,
because he's a real doll.
Talking about Toussaint McCall.
I moved your picture
From my walls
And I replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you
And oh, my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, nothing
Takes the place of you
I
I write this letter
It's raining
On my window pane
And
I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same
So I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I love you
But I'm all alone
And oh, my darling
Oh, Link, this is so romantic.
I wish...
I wish I was dark-skinned.
Oh, Tracy.
Our souls are black,
even though our skin is white.
Oh, Seaweed.
Oh, Seaweed,
will integration ever come?
Oh, Penny, my little white lily.
We're outcast from both
societies, black, white.
Our love is taboo.
Oh, go to second.
Go to second.
Oh, yes.
Seaweed, look.
Tracy. Tracy Turnblad,
It's your mommy.
- Oh, my God, it's my mother.
- She's gonna kill us.
- There they are. Tracy! Tracy!
- I'm gonna die.
Where are they?
Don't run, Tracy.
You'll fall. You have heels on.
You'll fall, honey.
Hello, hello! Oh, thank God.
Can we please come in for a little while?
- Open up.
- Please.
- Oh, come on.
- Open up.
- Let us in.
- Can we come in?
- Please?
- Come on, guys.
Come on. Come on.
Like, hi, cats.
Sit down.
- You got the fuzz chasing you?
- No, we were...
- Wow, you cats are real beatniks.
- Just like New York.
Day-o, day-o
Daylight's a-comin'
And he wanna go home
- You two checkerboard chicks?
- What?
You know, black and white,
salt and pepper.
Well, yes, I'm a
checkerboard chick, I guess.
Whoa! Whoa!
Phew!
- I'm an integrationist.
- Yeah.
We shall overcome someday.
Not with that hair, you won't.
You look like a hairhopper to me.
I mean,
your hair is really uncool.
How do you get your hair
so straight and so flat?
With an iron, man.
I play my bongos, listen to Odetta,
and then I iron my hair. Dig?
I think we'd better get going now.
The coast looks clear.
Let's do some reefer. We'll get high
and I'll iron the chicks' hair.
Reefer? Oh.
Drugs?
Locoweed.
When I'm high, I am Odetta.
Let's get naked and smoke.
Cool.
Don't breathe it in.
You'll be addicted.
Later, sister, later.
Much later.
I saw the best minds of my generation
Destroyed by madness
Starving, hysterical, naked
Dragging themselves...
Angelheaded hipsters burning for
The ancient heavenly connection
To the starry dynamo
In the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed
And sat up smoking in the...
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Dad?
Don't "hi, Dad" me.
The whole world saw you on the news.
Penny, this is Dr. Frederickson.
He's a psychiatrist, and he's
going to make you all better.
Feeling depressed, Penny?
Want to talk about it?
Think of all the white boys in school
and how much you'd like to date one.
Be a good little girl
and slip this on.
Shock treatments are the answer.
- Come here, Penny.
- What are you doing?
Good girl. Good girl.
- I love you, Seaweed!
- Shut up!
- Get her in the car.
- It'll be all right. Get her, doc, quick.
Prudy,
this is totally unnecessary.
Come on, honey. Time to go home.
You can see Link tomorrow.
We've been worried sick about you.
This neighborhood's no place for a star.
Get in that car before
someone sees you.
Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!
Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!
- Get out of here.
- Go back where you belong.
Well, personally,
I have nothing against them.
It's merely a matter of economics.
Tilted Acres
will never be integrated.
- Segregation today.
- Segregation tomorrow.
Segregation forever.
Hey.
One black face gets on camera,
this show's off the air.
The kids don't care
if blacks dance on the show.
This is ripping the city apart.
Motormouth Maybelle is
out there, and she's our friend.
We've done hops together for years.
The kids love her.
The Corny Collins Show
remains white.
Or you're all fired.
Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome
to The Corny Collins Show.
Yes, we are live from Tilted Acres.
Hop in the car,
bring the whole family, come out.
Right now I want to introduce
to you the top contenders...
in the Miss Auto Show contest,
Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad.
I understand you're both going to
introduce a new dance in the show today.
Yes, I am, Corny.
It's called the Limbo Rock.
And I bet some people will
find it quite difficult.
Here it is, the Limbo Rock.
Every limbo boy and girl
All around the limbo world
Gonna do the limbo rock
All around the limbo clock
Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick
Jack, go under limbo stick
All around the limbo clock
Hey, let's do the limbo rock
Good afternoon, Penny.
Feeling better?
Getting in touch with your anger?
Go, Tracy, go!
Limbo ankle, limbo knee
Bend back like a limbo tree
Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick
Jack, go under limbo stick
I watch that tramp
and I'm embarrassed to be white.
You know, Edna,
I've been reading about these kids.
Maybe Tracy could be
some sort of campus leader.
Wilbur, it's the times.
They're a-changing.
Something's blowing in the wind.
Fetch me my diet pills,
would you, hon?
Get yourself a limbo girl
Go back to Africa where you came from.
Your kind's not wanted here.
Baltimore, you saw it here first.
The Limbo Rock.
Thank you very much, Amber.
- I'm a winner, Corny.
- Well, Amber, you won the dance...
but let's check the election
results to see how you're doing.
We have an upset.
For the first time, Tracy Turnblad
is number one with a bullet.
What do you have to say
for yourself, Tracy?
If elected, I plan to
represent all of Baltimore.
Today I'd like to introduce
a brand-new dance...
and dedicate it to some
of my special friends...
who, because of small-minded people,
can't be here with me today.
My dance is called the Waddle.
That girl's got
roaches in her hair.
Roaches?
My little Tracy's a clean teen.
There's no bugs on our baby.
I'm not kidding.
I just saw one.
Amber,
you're such a comedian, heh.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tracy Turnblad and the Waddle.
You all make me sick.
- Tammy.
- What is going on here?
- Look, we had nothing to do with it.
- It isn't our fault.
Seaweed, come on.
Seaweed.
Tracy, just keep dancing.
Move it around here.
What, are you crazy?
Come on. Move out.
That's why I would like
to humbly state...
Daddy. Mommy. Daddy.
Mommy. Daddy.
- There's a riot going on.
- A riot?
- A race riot.
- A race...?
- Yo, I'm talking to you.
- Look, I have no...
Everybody just stay calm.
Stay calm...
You leave my boyfriend alone,
you witch.
- You scum!
- Stay back. Stay back.
Police brutality.
Police brutality.
- Negroes.
- Aah!
- Black boys.
- Aah!
Police brutality!
Police brutality!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Link! Link!
- Police brutality!
- Tracy!
Hey, let her go! Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Good evening.
Friday, June 5th, 1962.
Racially tense Tilted Acres
amusement park...
long a tradition of
Baltimore fun...
Penny.Penny.
- Seaweed?
- Penny. How are you?
Why are you here?
What happened to your head?
Uh, it happened at Tilted Acres.
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.
...the on-location
shooting of the TV dance...
Come on.
- Thanks for coming.
- Unh.
They'll be held at
Montrose Reform School...
Come on.
- Identified as Tracy Turnblad...
- Be careful.
Girl, they gonna flip when
they see the new you.
including Link Larkin...
That's Link Larkin, my boyfriend.
- Ooh!
- Boyfriend.
- -Common-law boyfriend
of Miss Turnblad...
was listed in fair condition
at Union Memorial Hospital tonight...
recovering from
two fractured kneecaps...
received in one of many incidents
of violence that erupted today.
I love you, Tracy.
Tracy Turnblad is a
human roach nest.
Is this the caliber of teenager we want
representing Baltimore at the auto show?
Amber will be so proud of us.
We're going to go down in the history
books for this one, Velma.
Tracy's parents had an emotional
appeal for their daughter.
Tracy, honey,
we know you are innocent.
It's Miss Edna.
- Has she always been that big?
- We joined the NAACP.
And we will fight in every way
possible to get you released...
and back in front of
the cameras where you belong.
Penny!
- Integration is no laughing matter.
- God. It's Mother.
Black and white, take hands...
- Hey, it's Motormouth.
- Mom.
and let them know that
we will not stand for racism.
Free Tracy Turnblad.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Ahem.
Free Tracy Turnblad! Free...!
Now, darling, aren't you glad
that you were punished...
and under psychiatric care?
You could have been killed today.
I wish I was at a hootenanny...
- in Harlem.
- Ha, ha.
- What was that?
- Ah, just the TV.
I heard somebody laugh.
Oh, my God! There are
colored people in my house!
I'm gonna make a citizen's arrest.
Stop! Stop!
- Paddy, stop them.
- What the...?
Come on, Penny.
Penny Pingleton,
I'm calling the cops.
You are no longer my daughter.
You are punished even after you die.
It's a real pleasure to be here
today in the city of Baltimore...
at this wonderful auto show.
Thank you very much.
I have my aide here with the scissors
and we're gonna take this opportunity...
to open the show here
in the city of Baltimore.
- There we are.
- Thank you, governor.
Wonderful to see you again.
How are you doing?
How do you do?
So nice meeting you.
You've got some
spinach on your tie.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never! Integration now!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never!
Now, just remember, if Amber loses,
she walks off the set...
and then you throw the bomb.
Who the hell is Tracy Turnblad?
She's an upper lower-class teenager...
who was arrested
in yesterday's demonstration...
and is currently being held
at Montrose.
- She is a hairhopper.
- A what?
- Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Jesus Christ.
More integration pickets.
This is a political hot potato
and I wasn't even warned.
This came out of nowhere.
We had no idea of her
grassroots support.
You keep the goddamn cops away
before this makes the national news.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Governor, governor.
We must have some answers
for our vast television audience.
Voters are demanding answers
right here at the governor's mansion.
This demonstration's gonna turn nasty.
We've got to get answers.
- Hey, no police. No police.
- Good evening, governor.
- May I speak with you?
- How are you, dear?
What are you doing? What is this?
What's with the handcuffs?
Oh.
Hi, honey. I'm... I'm home.
Well, Baltimore, today's the big day.
We're here live at the new armory...
for the grand opening
of the 1963 Auto Show.
And who will be the dancing princess
from our council to be crowned queen?
We'll know right after this.
No cops. No cameras.
We're gonna work this thing out
ourselves, aren't we?
Madame, you do have
the key to these?
We'll talk about the key
after you release Tracy.
Stinky, stinky, stombo...
The moment of truth
has arrived, ladies and gentlemen.
- You, the audience, made your decision.
- Excuse me.
And here to announce the
results we have Mr. Arvin Hodgepile...
president of WZZT studios,
ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. Thank you.
We have a difficult situation
with the votes tabulation.
The results were quite close.
Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!
Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!
Technically, the winner is
Miss Tracy Turnblad.
Yeah!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Quiet.
Shut up, or we're
going off the air.
Now listen carefully.
Since Miss Turnblad is in reform school,
the judges have found her ineligible.
I would like to announce
on behalf of WZZT...
the winner of the Miss Auto Show
1963, Amber Von Tussle.
Let's talk this over.
We can discuss this.
Oh, what...? Oh, wow.
Let's talk it over.
- Leave him alone.
- We can talk... I'll call.
Well, Amber, like it or not,
you're officially Miss Auto Show 1963.
Any words for your opponent who
many feel was the more popular winner?
I'd like to lead a dance
and dedicate it to that loser.
Tracy Turnblad, I hope you're watching,
because this one's for you.
It's a brand-new dance, one that
I'm sure you'll know how to do.
It's called the Roach.
Too bad you can't be
here to do it.
I'm the winner!
Leave me alone!
Amber Von Tussle and the Roach.
There's a dance
They're callin' the Roach
It's buggin' all the kids
From coast to coast
Well now, form a big line
Do the Roach
Everybody, now
Squish, squash
Kill that roach
Well, there's a roach
Upon my floor
For Christ's sakes,
pardon Tracy Turnblad.
- All right!
- Whoo!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Squish, squash
Kill that roach
Tracy?
What are you doing here?
I got something for you.
Amber.
Wait. Hold on.
Baltimore, you are seeing
history being made today.
White and black together
for the first time on local TV.
- I hate you, Tracy Turnblad.
- The Corny Collins Show is integrated!
Yes, all right!
Amber, we're going home now.
No, Mommy, no!
Stop. Get away from me.
Get away. Come on.
I'm a married man with a family.
Don't hurt me, please.
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you, Baltimore.
I don't know about you,
but I feel like dancing.
I've got the Bug.
Everybody's jumpin'
Movin' around
Nobody's standin' still
Keepin' their ground
You can't tell what'll happen
When they pass it around
It's the bug
You got it, you got it
You're all on your own
Somehow it seems better
When you do it alone
- What are you doing? Ow!
- Give me that.
You little... Ugh.
Well, come on, baby
Let's do the Bug
Mm, come on, baby
And give me a hug
Come on, baby
My turn's long due
I wanna Bug
Bug a hole in my shoe
Well, real bugs bug me
No matter what size
Come down. Come down.
- Itching powder.
- Itching powder?
Oh, oh, oh!
- Let's dance!
- Yeah!
