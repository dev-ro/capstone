30 Seconds To Mars

30 million dollars.
Cute, right?
This summer, the band's

filed a breach of contract

30 Seconds To Mars,
however,
Jared insists that the band
was just exercising
their legal rights.

What do they want?
30 million dollars.
- [laughs] Really?
You're being sued for

What are you...[stammers]
How do you sleep at night?
I have no idea
where the number came from,
other than...
it-it certainly wasn't a-
a wink to the-to the press
or weren't we clever
to use the same number.
30 Seconds To Mars
had just sold a lot of...
...uh, a lot of albums
and never made any money.
We weren't really
expecting a bunch of money,
we just thought it bizarre
that... that all of this revenue
was being generated and that
we're still 2.7
million dollars in debt,
so we started to look into it.
30 Seconds To Mars
suffered a contract
that wasn't even really
a direct contract with EMI.
It was a bad deal.
They basically told us
to-to shut up
and go make another album.
They weren't addressing
our concerns,
that we had with the contract,
so we decided
to terminate with EMI.
We've been signed
for nine years.
Under California law,
you can't be held bound
to a contract
for more than seven years,
which the courts and myself
and we all feel
is pretty reasonable.
[Jared, voiceover]
On July 4th, 2008,
we sent
a termination letter to EMI.
We cited the seven-year statue,
which legally ended our
contract with the company.
With any lawsuit, there's-there's
two sides of the argument.
Your side of the argument
was...
...um, our contract
is no longer valid
because of
the seven-year statue.
And their side of it is,
no, that's not applicable.
You have a commitment
based on a number of albums,
based on the amount of money
we've spent
and you're not free
to terminate this.
It really is
David against Goliath

the label-the Goliath-was,
well, here's a
30-million-dollar lawsuit,

gonna keep you awake.

- But they don't do that.
- No.
They make the artist do that.

Musical taste actually
begins to form in the womb.
The developing fetus has a
fully functioning
auditory system at 20 weeks.
And it's hearing all the
sounds of the environment.
Music is everywhere. It's really woven
into the fabric of everyday life.
Perceptual studies
have shown that
in the hierarchy of needs,
the two things that people
care most about
are music and sex.
So, there's no question that
music is-is a primal need
and it's unbelievably powerful.
No other art form
works like music.
Paintings are beautiful, but,
you know, once you see it,
eventually, you-
you see everything in it.
With music,
I-it's rather changing.
For a piece
of music to succeed,
it has to take you through
some sort of emotional journey.
The right chord sequence,
the right few seconds
of a song and you're
right there. [Snaps fingers]
That's exactly how I feel.
I love in trying to interpret
what the music is saying.
Both lyrically and musically,
that's why I like music.
And once I try and figure it
out I have cr-personally crazy
fantasies of what the person
was thinking about
when they wrote that
and why they wrote that
and how does it relate to me.
That's what music is.
You mix the right
word at the right time
with something that's-that's
beautiful and moving
and sort of...
makes you, you know,
the hair on the back
of your neck stand up,
it-it's an incredible moment.
That's probably why we need it,
because it's-it's wonderful.
A song has a story in it.
There's a heart behind it,
there's a frequency within it
and you as a person delivered
it and that's why people care.
Music is the most powerful
vehicle in the world.

Despite the lawsuit,
we decided to move forward
and start making our new album.
And that meant
financing it ourselves.
So, we built a studio
in the basement
of a house in Hollywood Hills,
hired Flood
and began the process.
[techno beat continues ♪]
Flood is like this
superstar producer.
A legend, a guy that has made
albums that will live forever.
I mean, 20 years I've been
listening to his work.
I used to look at the back of albums and
CD's and tapes and who's this guy, Flood?
I didn't even know
if he was a real person.
You always see this
mysterious little name, Flood.
He produced Depeche Mode.
U2.
Nine Inch Nails.
PJ Harvey.
Smashing Pumpkins and the...
the most important, obviously,
is 30 Seconds To Mars, so.
His wide range of creativity
is-is aspiring.
For me, creativity is
about vulnerability,
taking risks,
showing one's true emotion.
And to be able to make
everybody feel as though they
can make mistakes.
They can put themselves
out there
and there's no recriminations.
Jared took on a huge
responsibility and a huge
burden when he chose
to start making This Is War
without a label on board.
He didn't know what the
future held for the band.
It was very scary because he was letting
me know, like, look we're alone.
There ain't gonna be any
money coming in,
whatever we as a band,
or really me, Jared, as like,
the leader,
did good business to save some
of the money that we made.

which may result
in zero dollars.
[chattering]
We had to bet on ourselves,

Irving Azoff and our lawyer,
Peter Paterno.
[car honking in the distance]
[indistinct talking]
[Azoff] How you doing, man?
[Jared] I'm good.
Okay, what do you want to do?
What I'd like to happen
is that I would like
to go to court.
I'd like to sit in front
of a jury of my peers.
I think in any lawsuit,
that's a slam dunk,
you're still at 20 percent
chance you get screwed.
Let me ask
a big-picture question.
Signing a record deal with
a traditional record company,
or not,
what are the other options?
[Azoff stammering]
My view has always been that
any deal that doesn't
involved a major record label
is better than any deal any
major label would offer you
because you have your
ownership to your masters.
[Paterno]: The other issue
too, you gotta keep in mind,
is either if you sign with one
of these other alternatives,
E-EMI's still suing you.
It seems like we're between
a rock and a hard place,
either sign some antiquated,
dinosaur deal...
[Paterno] Right... But
what's the new model, then?
[Paterno]: The new model
is worse.
So the antiquated,
dinosaur deal is a good deal.
Why isn't there
a new model that's better?
[Paterno]: Because...[indistinct] [Jared]:
People are listening to music more than ever.
'Cause they're all
losing money.
[Paterno]: They're not buying it. They may
be listening, but they're not buying it.
They're not paying for it, it
makes it even less valuable.
[Azoff] If it were a traditional record
company owner, we wouldn't be sitting here,
I would've settled
this a long time ago.
We-we-we drew a bad card,
we drew a guy
from outside the business,
who doesn't play
by industry rules,
who doesn't give a shit.
We can't get them to-to settle?
[Azoff] They're not
gonna settle now.
They said to me, uh, "I don't
care how long it takes",
I don't care how angry it
makes the other label groups,
"I will go to court

The record business is in
very, very serious trouble.
If you look at historically,
other businesses
that have gone away,
uh, I just think there's kind of
a gradual decline-
well, gradual-it's been
pretty s-severe,
but like this.
And then, it just reaches
kind of a tipping point
and just falls off a cliff.
[rhythmic ambience ♪]
The economics around
the record business,
is based on selling albums.
You know, growing up you had
to buy the entire album
to get the song you loved-
you had to!
And now what happens is,
a kid is sitting at home,
and goes, "I gotta hear
that 'Kings and Queens' song."
I gotta hear that."
They don't have to get
in a car or ask their parents
and save up 12 bucks
to go buy it.
Now that you're given
the choice
and you can buy the song
that you love
without buying the album?
People are going to do that.
Not only that, when you
can buy-have it for free!
Record sales have
dipped 20 percent a year
for the last six years now.
That's a lot.
The music business has really
become decimated
and it has been largely
because of illegal downloads,
other factors, too.
But the predicament
we're in now
is that an entire generation
of music listeners,
virtually everybody
under the age of 21,
has grown up in a world where,
for their entire
sentient lives,
they've never
had to pay for music.
And they look at people
my age and who buy music,
they think we're saps.
I mean, why would you pay
for something that's free?
It'd be like paying for air.
I've heard someone
like Trent Reznor say,
"You know, you work like
a fucking year on something,"
and you put all of this time
and you spent all this money
on creating... these songs.
And a cup of coffee,
at the end of the day,
"costs more than your song."
Consumers wouldn't walk
into a grocery store
and steal a loaf of bread
and have it.
But it became okay
to steal music.
Um, that really isn't
something you blame
the labels for.
You know, that's technology.
The labels have never been
cohesive enough to create
their own future
distribution systems,
which is why it took a
computer company
to start iTunes.
Um, had they been smart enough,
they would've co-owned
their own digital
delivery like iTunes.
You know,
that was a big mess up.
When Apple, which is a great
company, don't get me wrong,
is the third largest company
in America and the biggest
music retailer in America,
[stammers] I think,
that's concerning.
It's a device manufacturer.
The labels are petrified
and terrified and they
don't know what's going on,
they don't even understand
their own industry anymore.
They were too big and slow
to change,
so I do think that's-they're
just gonna start to crumble.

really began

Irving was talking to them.
We had made some efforts to
address some commercial terms

probably inappropriate.

EMI is going
private next month.
The British Music Publisher

five billion dollars.
Terra Firma is a U.K. based
private equity company.
They tend to buy
companies that are...
...distressed, um,
not necessarily companies
that are
in distress industries,
which is an important point
when you come back around
to EMI.
If you're in England,
I imagine you're looking at EMI
and it's the home of The Beatles
and it's one of the most
iconic British companies ever.
And you say to yourself,
"Wow, I can fix that, too."
They're just-those dummies
don't-I'm sure they don't know
what they're doing either.
"So, let me buy that
and turn it around."
The real principle
of Terra Firma is Guy Hands.
He's essentially the guy
who runs Terra Firma.
Guy Hands is, uh,
he's a self-made billionaire.
He's been
incredibly successful.
One of the victories he had
was that he bought all the,
uh, gas stations on the
highway in Northern Europe.
And he cleaned the bathrooms!
Once they cleaned them,
all the sudden,
business went up
at the gas stations,
at the convenience stores
attached them-to them,
and he made a ton of money.
They spent billions
of dollars on a company.
And I really think that
they believed
they could transform it.

came in and purchased EMI,
they became the factor regime

We're getting' there.
But there's still lots to do.
I've never heard of a label
that doesn't screw an artist.
You talk to anybody...
who audits their label,
they're always owed money.
And of nothing else...
usually the label holds back
enough money,
that your cost of auditing
is such that you won't do it.
So that's the business model...
is screwing the artist.
Their financial practices
have been shady
since the beginning of time.
It's been grandfathered in
since the '50s and '60s
when rock and roll
really started.
In the '50s, they were
screwing the artists then
but there was much,
much less money involved.
Then as you started to go
into the '60s and '70s,
the hit to shit ratio is so
bad that they're saying,
"Hey... you know,
we can't pay the hit artist
'cause he's paying
for all the bad artists."
It goes back to how
the music industry was set up
in the very early stages
of the recording industry,
taking advantage of uneducated,
easily swayed artists
who don't really care
about the money.
Unfortunately, there's a lot
of fallout with-
still, with bands getting
paid, you know,
we had to sue our label
to get paid.
And they've created
this strange...
convoluted system
that you have to be a lawyer
to really understand
or a mathematician.
[Jared, voiceover] A typical record
deal is structured something like this.
The record label
gives an advance,
say 250,000 dollars to the
artist to record an album.
The artist then records
the album.
Suppose that the album sells
500,000 copies
at 10 dollars each,
yielding 5 million dollars.
The record label then takes
their cut out of the 5 million,
typically 85 percent
of the total sales,
leaving the artist
with 750,000 dollars.
But before the artist
receives any payments,
the label first
deducts the advance.
In addition, the record label
recoups other costs
such as recording costs,
half the promotion costs,
half the video costs,
and tour support.
This leaves the artist 425,000
dollars in debt to the record label.
And then this debt gets
carried on to the next album,
the next album
and the next album.
I don't know if most people
have seen long form contracts.
They're insane and there's all these little...
these little things thrown in.
It's kind of like legislating-you
know, legislature for a government.
They put up this big issue
but underneath that issue,
there is like 17 other little
laws that they threw in
that they're not talking about.
So when you say yes
to this one thing,
you're actually saying yes
to like 45 other things.
There's-there's a worse one.
They used to have damage fees
with digital downloads.
Digital downloads, like at
first they were doing that,
like they're just trying to
get away with murder, you know,
just like, "Let's leave it
in there",
"let's see if the lawyer sees
it" kind of thing.
[Jared, voiceover] Some other hidden
items that the contract includes are...
packaging costs.
They deduct up to 25 percent
of the artist's cut,
known as a royalty, to cover the
expense of plastic cases and artwork.
This cost is even administered
to digital downloads
where packaging is nonexistent.
Ten percent is deducted to
cover breakage costs
during shipping.
This started in the vinyl era,
continued when CDs
replaced vinyl,
and still applies today
with digital downloads.
The 10 percent
free goods deduction
is an antiquated system
where retailers purchase
100 albums
but are given an additional
10 albums at no charge.
Since the artist is only paid
on albums sold,
they are not compensated
for those free albums.
This deduction still continues
even in
a digitally-dominated market.
Artists generate so much money
for so many people
that have nothing to do with
the creative process at all.
There is no-there is no road
you can go down
that the artist isn't fucked.
Most people out there
who have jobs...
they can go to their boss,
ask for a raise.
They can leave
and go get another job
if they're not happy.
Musicians don't really
ave that ability to do that.
And by the way,
if we don't like-
if we don't feel like
pushing your records anymore
and we don't feel like
you're going to sell,
we're not going to let you go,
we'll just kind of put you
on the shelf over here
and won't really let you work.
But we're not going to let
you leave either.
It's like being in
a bad marriage.
At what point does
your husband beat you up
or your wife beat you up,
and you say,
"I've had enough, I'm leaving."
That's the point
we're at right now.

you guys sent 8 billion

You can't afford not to put

"Stop being ridiculous."
You need to go back to

"I can't get that done."
I said,
"Oh, so you're telling me"
that Mr. Litigious
can't get that done.
"That's quite all right,

I said, "But you can

You know what he says,
"We will not settle."
We've already suffered
from the lawsuit-
"the bad press
from the lawsuit."
I said, "No, no, no, no." We haven't
started promoting the lawsuit yet."
Throughout our company
we have a zillion artists.

You had a long meeting
the other day.
Yeah.
EMI wants to make a deal.
Interesting.
It's a shitty deal, but...
it's a deal.
So...
we have a couple options.
There's the option that's
exciting to go on our own.
It feels like there is a lot
of opportunity
with that independent... spirit
and taking the mindset that...
rather than sign
an antiquated deal
with a company that...
has no interest in really...
doing anything except making
the numbers work.
But that's the reality.
If you want to sign
a record deal...
that's what you're doing.
All I know is both options...
[exhales] Scary.
Both options are a big gamble.
See, I don't know enough
to have a real opinion,
but it seems like going on our
own is the only way to go.
I don't know, it's hard.
Gimme a name of one band
that's had continued
worldwide success
without a label.
I can't give you one.
Some people say
to take the deal.
- Settle?
- Yeah.
Just take
whatever deal you can get
'cause it's so fucked right now.
Basically you're looking
for a record company
to handle very specific things
like promotion and marketing
and things that I don't really
want to have to deal with.
Right.
If we go...
completely independent,
I'll end up...
that'll be my life.
From morning, noon, and night,
is going to be having to...
have a record company.
Feelin' a pushami?
Yeah, I'm feelin' a pushami.
You take the rock
of your choice...
or a boulder, depending on
how big your issue is,
and you throw it
over the precipice,
and when you throw it
you scream and you let go
of this particular aspect of-
of who you are,
or something in your life
that's plaguing you,
and you leave it behind,
and um...
well, we're gonna do it
right now.
Want me to start, or you wanna?
I'll go first.
Yeah, you go first.
Let's see what you got.
[screaming]
I just heard someone say
"Ouch".
[shouting]
That was pretty good.
- It never landed.
I hear dogs barking.
- What does that mean?
This is so fuckin' nuts.
Yeah.
By the way, I think I came up
with a name for the album.
What is it?
This is War.
It's easier than ever
to make music and record it.
It's easier than ever
to make videos
and record them properly.
It's easier than ever
to put them out there,
but it's harder than ever
to make them heard
or have them heard because there's
so much noise on the internet.
So a record company still
has to do the job
of helping to filter that and
to promote things properly
so that they can get noticed.
And there are certainly
exceptions,
as artists that have done
well without record companies,
but by and large the...
overwhelming majority of
artists that have achieved,
you know, major success have
been signed to major labels.
Major labels are
giant cyclopses
and they have one very
monstrously powerful eye
right in the middle of their
forehead,
and when it's staring at you,
you know,
the world is a very bright and
shiny place and when it's not,
there's no getting the
attention of that thing.
If I knew a band was going to
sign a major label deal,
I would probably try to
dissuade them
or I would at least try to
figure out
what they thought they were
going to get out of it.
Increasingly,
artist development is...
a term that's not even used
at record companies, you know.
They use the word
artist development
but it's offensive
to a certain point
'cause they
don't really do that.
They look at the profiles,
in the old days,
it was MySpace.
The profile numbers, now it's
Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
Can you sell 10, 20,000
on your own without a label
and if so, then they start
paying attention,
you know, kind of thing.
But yeah, that's not
artist development,
that's already signing an
artist that's developed itself.
I think that the main reason
people really want labels now
is legitimacy.
Especially if you're
a new band that, uh...
that what you're doing really
kind of matters
and is part of something,
and to get the press
and to get people
to believe in you.
I'll even see bands though
that they get big on their own
and then sign with a label
for that legitimacy.
One thing
we've definitely learned
is that artists need help.
Metric is a great example.
They were the first artist
to break top five...
in pop radio with no label.
But if you talk to Matt
Drouin who manages Metric,
he'll tell you, We had more
people working on that record
than if we were at a label.
We just hired them ourselves.
So, no, we didn't have a label
but we kind of built
our own staff around it.
When I got off the label,
I pretty much knew I didn't
want to sign with another one
and I knew nothing could beat
doing direct business
with my fans.
It wasn't...
There was no deal in the
world that was that good.
I cannot tell you how many
emails I got from fans
saying we want to
directly support you.
How can we do it so your
label doesn't get the money?
Give people awesome music
and then make it very easy
for them to help you...
and they will. There are lots
of artists, like I said,
who are finding themselves
with this choice
and it's not to say that the
labels can't win the argument
as to why an artist should
use them or partner with them.
But it is to say that...
there's a great...
number of tools available
to independent artists
to do it on their own
and they're not necessarily
considerably inferior...
to the label choice.

I just want to-and it's not even the
fight to fight to beat somebody.
It's the fight to-to-to-
for what's right, what's fair.
If you sign the deal,
in a way it's a compromise

so that you can...
you could get in on the inside,
work with somebody

Guy Hands was tight lipped
as he arrived at a cinema
to outline the music group's
new direction.
Inside, staff learned that EMI
is set to axe up to 2,000 jobs.
They strip-mined the place.
They fired tons and tons
of people.
They put people in charge that
had never had any experience
in the record business
or the music business.
They sort of decentralized it.
They had all these strange pods
instead of a more
traditional structure.
They also put some people
in positions of power
who didn't make any sense
to me whatsoever.
I see it all the time.
It's just the heavy hand of guys
who don't understand the business
trying to tell people who
do understand the business
how to do their jobs.
I met with him once
and he said to me,
"All you people from
the music business, you know,
you really don't know how
to run a business."
They installed... a lot of people across
the global leadership of the company
and most people in senior
management levels
and these are serious record
company executives,
were gone within a matter
of months.
Obviously, I have
a certain bias
that I was there
and I was very vocal about
any of my disagreements.
They wanted to restructure
the company
and under the terms
of my contract,
they couldn't
without asking me.
And so they did it anyway.
In the old days, you'd say,
what does EMI think
and you would name 10 people
that had worked there
for 20 or 30 years, and you'd
worry about what they thought.
But there's nobody that's worked
there for 20 or 30 years.
It's not the company or the
people that it ever was.
We have been through
so many regimes at EMI
since we signed a contract
with Virgin Records.
I can't even tell you
how many it's been.
It would be safe to say
it's over eight,
less than 12.

This part of the record
is always really, really,

It's like the backing tracks
are there

It could be fast,
it could be slow,

And what I suggest
is that we need to look at
the whole thing...
because I'm--
We're definitely
missing a song.
I can tell you that right now.
I agree with you,
so it might be...
that there has to be a period
of just like, okay,
we are missing this.
We do need to do another song
but maybe
it hasn't been written.
But without...
at least getting some of
these other songs into point,
you're not going to know

♪ Choose your weapon
♪ Carefully
Art, it's something
that we all...
aspire our work to be.
Some people can do
whatever they think
of and what they
think of is special
and moves other people.
Those people are artists.
It's their bare,
honest truth...
about something that they love.
I think it's one
of the avenues to get
to one's self to find
out who we are.
Timeless art is the most
difficult form of art.
I see it in
the Chrysler Building.
I see it in the Concord.
I hear it in The Beatles.
The business is--
I hate all those people.
Those people are leeches.
All they ever do is care
about not losing their job.
They never once care about...
enhancing the value of art.l
One of the problems we have in
the business at large right now
is corporations own
these businesses.
So, it's very difficult to
change it ever because
it has to be this machine
that keeps going.
The other part of the
problem is that
the business itself
has homogenized
the process.
The record company tells
a band what to write,
how to write it,
who to write with,
you know, what's going
to be a single,
what's not going to be
a single and I think
has far too much control
on a creative level.
So that everything starts
sounding very much the same.
It's a pendulum, I think.
What inevitably happens
is that companies that
are wrestling with that
creative, intuitive,
blended with science,
they swing way too far
to the, let's be scientific
and mathematical,
sort of throw the baby
out with the bathwater
and lose that comfort
with intuition,
creative sensitivities and
mistakes get made that way.
The record companies
keep consolidating
and so there's less of
them and that's dictated
by the fact that it is
a business
and as business shrinks
and as less people buy
music, what do record
companies do?
They cut costs.
So, as a result of that,
you have less places
for artists to go, less
people getting signed.
I don't think it ever ends.
I don't think it ever ends.
I've been in this business
19 years
and it was going on the
day I started
and it's going on now.
You know, I don't know
that art and commerce
ever get married like that.
Hello?
[woman on phone] Jared,
they're grabbing Irving.
Okay.
Brenna, Jared's on
the other line.
It's what they told you
they were going to do.
They wouldn't meet with us,
they don't like us. [Laughing]
You know?
[Jared]: Yeah, I'm beginning not
to like them very much either.
Documentary, you can't
use your own music?
Yeah, I don't understand
how that even happened.
I don't even know why
we brought this up.
We should have never
even brought it up.
No, I mean, they would
have said no later,
you had to bring it up.
But you couldn't have
just put the music in.
You'd have to say--
You know what I mean?
So, if there's a shot of
me sitting and playing
one of my songs on the piano...
at the house, I'll have to
get permission from EMI
in order to release
this documentary?
Correct... They're
basically going to say...
that we have a contract
with you for two more
albums so this is a
settlement of that
contract and under that
old contract,
you couldn't just put any music
in the DVD without them.
They own the music, not you.
And the way they've worded it,
they have like final cut
over this thing.
They're like, "We need to
see a copy of it"
and then we'll talk about
if we're going to license
"you the music for it."
Is that basically how it is?
Yeah, they're trying to get
you to abandon the project.
Trying to get me
to abandon the film?
Yup.
So, let's have a call.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
[sighs]
It all comes down.
So, basically you
sell the film...
for the record deal.
[laughs]
Or you just take EMI
out of the film.
'Cause then they'll say,
"Sure, we'll let you
put it out."
[beep]
What's up girls?
Hello?
Howdy.
To me, there's clearly two
factions in this company.
There's one that just
doesn't want to make
a deal with you, and
there's one that does
want to make a deal with you.
It's a further slap in the
face to say...
you can't do the documentary.
It makes no rational
financial sense.
I think I'd go back
to them and say,
"We own the documentary and we
can do what we want with it."
Will you reiterate that
there's more to life
out there than a bloated
failing corporation.
[sighs] Fuck...
What a day.
What a day.
It could have been worse. The record
company could have told us to go
fuck ourselves.
Oh wait, they just did.
EMI should be ashamed
of themselves.
They came back with
their offer today.
As soon as we're
getting somewhere,
some giant fucking
moron at the company
thinks that they're going
to control and own this.
Well, guess what? They
can kiss my fucking ass.
It's over.
We're not doing it.
I just talked to Irving.
Fucking idiots, man!
Good. Greedy, fucking
corporate hubris.
We suggested a meeting, right?
So, we could all sit face
to face and not get lost
in the deal and to be
human about things.
They said no.
Just so you know, said no.
They think that they're
going to own that piece
of music with me just
diddling on the piano.
I'll do it right now
just for fun.
Look...
That's not yours, not mine.
No, it's just--
It's just ludicrous.
Selling recorded music,
that's the record.
And that's historically the
only thing that a record
label has cared about...
until that stopped
making money.
If 30 Seconds to Mars
started today,
they'd have an even
worse deal than they
originally signed 'cause they have
what they call these 360 deals.
They'd have to give
away a piece of their
merchandising and
their touring...
to get their record deal.
Thank God we didn't get stuck
in one of those deals.
360 deal is when a
record label participates
in all revenue streams
of an artist.
Typically touring, merchandise,
could be publishing,
licensing opportunities,
endorsement opportunities.
It's direct response to the
fact that no one's selling
10 million records anymore.
Even when you have a big hit,
they aren't as big
as they used to be.
So if you're going
to invest big money
in making an artist famous,
then you've got to find
more ways to collect.
The argument I had with
one of these deals
is I said, "OK, if my client
has a baby and sells"
baby pictures, do you
participate in that?"
"Well, yes."
Over the last 18 months,
90 percent of the deals
that have been,
you know, signed by EMI
have an extended
amount of rights.
If they're not 360,
they are, you know,
280 or 2-- Yeah,
whatever, you know.
So yes, definitely,
definitely more.
Everyone wants 360
now as far as labels.
Majors at least.
Indies are still not
necessarily all 360.
You know, some do, some don't.
So how does it help an artist?
Well, it doesn't.
You've got no leverage,
you're a band just
starting out.
And neither label will
take this off the table.
So what do you do?
For a band to do a 360 deal,
well now they're
turning over...
their real cash prize,
which is their ability to
make money touring
and make money selling
merchandise.
What do labels typically
take from a 360?
You know, they vary
depending on--
You know, I've seen as
much of 10 to 25 percent
of the artist's piece.
You know, I've seen
some of the television
star deals go as high
as 50 percent.
Pretty crazy.
They've just got this entire
plantation mentality that they
should own everything
that an artist does.
And I've never been
comfortable with that!
I just really hate that.
I don't need your permission,
massive record company
owner to go do,
you know, things like
movies or TV shows.
Screw you guys!

made a lot of sense.
And so here we are
with Citigroup
taking control of EMI.
The decline and
demolishment of EMI
is a sad 21st century
story of failure.
He was running a whole
company that
categorically he was
incapable of running.
Obviously, it turned out to
be a tremendous mistake.
He bought it at the wrong time.
He really believed he was going
to transform it and then sell it.
I don't think he thought
that he would own it
and then lose it.
What EMI now is,
is a bump sitting
on Citibank's balance sheet...
waiting to be removed
from their balance sheet
and sold to the next sucker.
There is no killer app to
turn around a record company.
It has to be done
slowly and patiently
and it takes time.
It takes time to break artists.
It takes time to sign artists.
It takes time to get
the right executives in.
I think that Guy,
and I'd say this to his face,
is a very bright guy
who unfortunately...
had the...
popular misimpression...
that the music business is
populated by idiots and thieves.
We've got our
fair share of them,
but there's a lot of smart,
good people
in the business.
Just because a guy
is a billionaire,
and he's made a bunch of money
in other businesses, you know,
we have a long list
of people...
from outside the music business
that have come and
entered the business
and left in ruins.
And he's been the biggest
fool of all of them.
[singing] The moment of truth
and the moment to lie.
The moment to live and
the moment to die.
The moment to fight,
fight, fight.
The moment to fight,
to fight, to fight, to fight.
You know what I think? What?
I think we're going to
finish this song tonight.
♪ It's the moment of truth
and the moment to lie ♪
♪ And the moment to live
and the moment to die ♪
♪ The moment to fight,
the moment to fight ♪
♪ To fight, to fight
Pretty good one,
pretty good one.
Let's call it finished.
Whoa!
High five! Yeah!
[celebrating]
Come on,
don't leave me hanging!
[♪ 30 Seconds to Mars:
"Search and Destroy"]
The future of the music
business is unknown.
That's what makes
it exciting to some
and really scary to others.
Because people can
record in their houses
and distribute overnight,
I believe that music can
reclaim its space
as the driving medium.
There's change,
there's evolution.
If you don't ride
the change, you die.
Jared always jokes
around, he says,
"Some kid is going to
write a song"
and he's going to
figure it out,
and he's going to sell a
hundred million copies
of his single by himself.
And he's going to make
a billion dollars.
And he's going to say,
'Fuck you, I don't need you.'
"And then that's going to
be the new beginning."
People listen to more
music now than ever
before from a bigger
diversity of artists.
So I think culturally we're
in a much better place.
I look at it and
I actually think we're
sort of entering the
golden age of music.
I love the idea that we may,
in this next generation
not be living...
in a world
of the possibility of
you know, being
successful is that
you have to be Michael
Jackson, Madonna,
Prince, Lady Gaga.
But that actually like the
dream of being musician
means that you can
just make a living
and connect with people
and make your music.
And not have to have
a job you hate.
Music will never die.
It will always drive industry.
It will always
drive innovation.
It will always be
available to everyone.
And everyone always
is going to want it.
It doesn't really matter
what the critics say
or what the gatekeepers say.
Really in this day and age
in the music industry,
the new gatekeepers
are the fans.
If you have five million
people all downloading
your album for free,
that's still five million
people you've touched.
And there's a value to me
that's far greater than money.
