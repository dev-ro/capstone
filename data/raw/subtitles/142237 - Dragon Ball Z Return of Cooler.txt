What is it? An eclipse?
Not at this time of year.
After losing their home
planet at the hands of Frieza,
the people of Namek were
forced to find a new world
on which to continue
their peaceful existence.
Now, an invader of titanic proportions
has descended upon New Namek-
and unless some means of
combating this threat can be found,
the entire Namekian race
is in danger of extinction.
From across the galaxy,
Dende, the new Guardian of Earth,
has sensed the plight of his people.
And at the guidance
of his trusted advisor,
Mr. Popo, he has turned to the one man
who may be able to help.
It's all right. You can ask him, Dende.
Thank you.
Goku, save them?
All right! Dig in everybody!
Remember, you gotta eat if you
wanna keep your strength up!
Got that right!
Well, if I'd known that was the secret
I wouldn'tve done all
those push-ups this morning!
Thanks Master Roshi,
when were you gonna tell me?
Hey, Dad, you've been there.
What's it like on New Namek?
You know, it's a lot like Old Namek,
except there's more trees.
At least in the part I saw.
Anyway, we'll be sure to
take the tour before we leave.
Okay.
Great, if I'd known this would turn out
to be a family vacation,
I'd have kept my
Senzu Beans and stayed home.
That Yajirobe! Always a pleasure.
Hey, what about Piccolo?
Oh, him? Don't worry. He doesn't eat.
Yeah, a Namek's gotta watch
his figure, don't you know?
Heh! Now that you mention it,
he does look like
he's put on a few pounds.
Sure, to his ego maybe.
Hey! I'm a Super Namek!
Funny.
Shhhh! Quiet you guys,
I think he can hear you!
Oh-h, brother.
How did I know we were gonna
run into something like this?
What do you mean? Do ya-Do
you know what that thing is?
Yeah, it's big and scary.
You, sure one of
those is, New Namek?
Good point. I'm voting no.
Don't be stupid. It's the green one.
So what? Those are two planets?
Could be, but if I
didn't know any better.
I'd say the little one's
trying to eat the big one!
Okay. Let's go!
Enough of this.
Wait, stop! Please, brother!
My word, could it really be?
I'll say it once. Get off this planet.
Oh Gohan! It is you!
Thank goodness you've come!
The Namekian race
is not yours to conquer.
Hear that?
'Cause you better listen if
you know what's good for you!
You're outgunned!
It'd take a whole army a'
you clunkers to beat Goku!
I'm giving you this
chance to leave quietly.
I don't want to settle
this thing with violence.
But you must understand,
if you stay you will leave
me with no choice but to fight.
Get the picture, metal-heads?
Outta' here or it's the scrap-heap!
Hey. That way, tough guy.
What, are you crazy?
You want 'em to hear me?
Spare me the theatrics.
You've made your demands clear.
It's a shame my Cyclopean
Guards are unable to answer.
But then, even if they were-
What would you
really expect them to say?
I know you.
You're Cooler!
But, he's dead!
He-ah he looks pretty alive to me!
Struggle all you want! It's over!
That's what you get
for disgracing my family!
You've murdered millions
of innocent people.
I can't let it go on!
Yes! It is I who decides
who lives and who dies!
All living beings are
mere playthings to me!
No one can comprehend
my power and cunning!
What?
Curse you!
Yes, by all accounts,
I should in fact be dead-
incinerated in the fires of your Sun.
But fate, it would seem,
saw fit that I have a second chance.
And thanks to the power
of the Big Gete Star,
I have been reborn-
stronger, and sleeker.
'New and improved', as you might say.
I wouldn't go that far.
So the Big Gete Star
is the monstrosity
attacking this planet?
I would bother to explain,
but you won't live long enough to care.
Namek filth, you survived me once,
but my guards will soon correct that.
I'd do it myself,
but I have a debt to collect.
You demented freak. I've heard enough.
Hey uh, it looks like they've
got things pretty
much under control, yeah?
So uh, whadda you say
we just go on home now, huh?
You big baby!
Quit your whining, would ya'?
Can't you be more like Master Roshi?
You don't hear him cryin' to leave.
Actually, you wouldn't happen
to remember where we parked.
Spread out!
Watch it, Krillin!
Right.
Now, I believe we have
some unfinished business.
Yeah. You mentioned a debt.
So I did.
Okay, this is officially
'way too intense'.
I already told ya'!
Either quit your whining
or find somewhere else to hide!
Ahh! Oh help.
Yeah, he's the man!
Oh mommy, I'm too young to die!
Hey, cut me some slack! I'm old.
Fine!
If that's the way you want to play it!
Warm up's over.
Hey, are you sure we
can't talk about this?
Didn't think so.
The pain.
So how you doing there buddy?
Not too good. These guys are tough.
Well you know I hate to say it,
but I'm glad it's not just me.
Piccolo.
I might have a way to pierce that armor.
Concentrate all of your
energy into your point of attack.
Focus!
That oughtta shake 'em up a bit.
Great, there's more.
Focus.
Right. Focus.
Now!!
Well, if they can do it-
Nope, didn't think so.
Ha ha! Yeah!
I'm coming!
No! Piccolo!
Gohan!
Why don't you just
leave it alone Cooler?
One should repay what one owes.
Like what what you owe the Earth!
Let me guess.
You're beginning to wonder
how you ever beat me before.
Very nice, I didn't think
there was time to dodge.
That was quite a clever trick.
You like that one, huh?
It's called Instant Transmission.
I know, it's one of
my favorite techniques.
Uh, your favorites?
This changes things.
So. The Super Saiyan has
finally decided to show himself.
Well I'd say it's only fitting.
Wouldn't you?
You see, this is the
way I remember you best.
Saiyan.
So this is how it
should be when you die.
Are you finished?
I think that got the point across.
Time I paid a visit to the Big Gete Star.
Let's end this!
Perhaps I should
have explained earlier-
my body is monitored constantly
by the Big Gete Star's main computer.
Any injury I might suffer is
instantly detected and repaired.
And whatever flaws in my design
that allowed the
injury are corrected.
It's quite remarkable really.
In simple terms, of course,
this means 'you can't win'.
I'll just have to try harder.
By all means. Try.
And now, the moment
I've dreamt of for so long.
Good-bye. Super Saiyan.
You'll spill no Saiyan blood today.
What's this?
Thanks, Vegeta.
A second Super Saiyan?
Second in order, perhaps,
but by no means in stature.
Your fight is with me now.
Kakarot's fate is
no longer your concern.
Super Saiyans, yes.
But monkeys all the same.
You're still all
show and no substance.
We'll see about that.
No you don't!
Enough!
You'll not make a fool of me!
There you are.
Excuse me! Your attention, please!
If you'd all be so
kind as to follow me,
We'll begin chopping you up.
No, no. It's not what you think.
We don't want to hurt you.
We only want the
energy from your bodies
to power the Big Gete Star.
So we just have to chop you up.
You ain't choppin' nothin'!
Well, well. You're quite
the spirited one, aren't you?
Good. we'll start with you.
Gohan!
Oh my, it seems we
have another visitor.
You, what are you doing here?
That metal freak.
I can't even pick myself up,
and we haven't even put a dent in him!
Hey, can you still fight?
What? What kind of question is that?!
Listen, at this rate, we're
not gonna make it much longer.
There's only one way for us to win.
We have to combine our powers
and attack him at the same time.
I don't take orders from you!
I thought you'd say that.
He's coming. Vegeta,
I need your help, please!
Just stay out of my way!
Why won't you die?!
You see, I knew we could
do it, if we worked together.
Heh, I've heard of stacking
the odds, but come on.
What is going on here?
Don't look so stunned.
As I said, the Big Gete
Star instantly corrects
any flaws to my body's design.
Even if the flaw is only
that I have one body.
Now I wonder,
if a single Meta-Cooler
gave you so much trouble,
how will you fare against 1,000?
Guess, we've got no choice but to try...
I, can't feel my legs.
Ah, great.
Well. It's been nice
knowing you, Vegeta.
Oh shut up.
Welcome to the Big Gete Star.
Cooler! where are you?
Ah. A difficult question to answer.
In one sense, I am
everywhere around you.
But I suppose what you're
looking for is right here,
in front of your eyes.
What?
The story is thus...
Somewhere forgotten deep in
space, there existed a single,
sentient, computer chip.
It floated for eons among a graveyard
of abandoned spaceships and satellites,
until one day this consciousness
devised a means
of propagating itself.
It began to absorb mass and
energy from its surroundings,
until it had grown from a single
chip into a giant machine.
At some point,
what was left of my body,
including my brain,
was also absorbed.
My consciousness was merged
with that of the main computer.
I took control. So in a sense,
I am the Big Gete Star.
And using the
technology at my disposal
I created a new,
metal body for myself-
a Meta-Cooler, if you will.
I think you know the one.
So what are you going
to do with us now?
Let's just say, I've decided
to extract my revenge.
What!
What a delicious irony,
that your energy is going
to fuel the destruction
of the very planet
you were trying to save!
Go on, finish it.
Wonderful! what exquisite agony!
Ah, it seems what they say is true.
All good things really
must come to an end.
But to think that these Super
Saiyans had this much energy.
Any more, and it would have
begun to exceed my capacity.
What? What was that?
How can I still be drawing power?
Stop! The circuit is
supposed to be closed!
Why does it keep flowing in?
Stop! It's overheating! I'm at my limit!
Stop!! STOP!!
Don't just stand there!
Get me offa' this table!
Try to hang on! We're
gonna figure something out!
Yeah, sure! Just take your time!! AHH!!
Cut and slice and chop them up!
And cut and slice and-
This way you guys! Hurry up!
Come on people let's move it!
Uh, you're kidding, right?
Well fellas, thanks for gettin' me killed.
Gohan!
Come on! This place
is starting to fall apart.
Hey! Piccolo!
The controls aren't responding!
I can't maintain my hold on the planet!
It would seem I
underestimated the amount of energy
these Super Saiyans were capable of.
That's the same mistake you
made last time, isn't it.
You think you would've learned by now.
Dad!
Goku!!
All of you, get out
of here as fast as you can!
I'll follow you as soon as
I take care of things here!
Wait! Are you sure?
In the shape you're in,
What exactly do you
plan to take care of?
Dad!
Gohan! You heard him!
We have to get
everyone out right now!
Come on, get out of there!
Dad, hurry up!
You can laugh if you want.
But you're not exactly
in a position to
defend yourself, are you?
I don't see any of your Meta-Coolers
coming to help you this time.
I'm not nearly as
defenseless as you think.
But you know the real pity?
As soon as you figure that out.
Who will be left to stop
me from devouring this planet?
I learn from my mistakes, Cooler.
I know now that there's only
one way to deal with your kind!
I've heard enough from you!!
It's just as I told you
from the start! You can't win!!
Even if that's true!
Every breath in my
body will be spent trying!
And that's the last time
you'll underestimate a Saiyan.
Goku.
Where's my dad?
Dad!
Good thing you brought those
Senzu Beans after all, huh Yajirobe?
Hey, where's Vegeta?
Ehh, you know Vegeta.
He's never really cared
much for happy endings.
Funny, 'cause I think it's his fault
that we have a happy
ending in the first place!
Thank you, Vegeta. I couldn't
have done it without you.
