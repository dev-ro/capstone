              ¶
         HMM.
IF THIS THING
WERE ANY MORE POWERFUL
YOU COULD SEE THE LORD HIMSELF
IN HIS HEAVEN.
        WELL, AS I SAY,
 IF YOU WANT A JOB DONE WELL,
 DON'T LEAVE IT TO A LESSER MAN.
    ( all grunting )
COME! COME!
                  BUGGER OFF!
                  NO!!!
COME ON!
BEHAVE, WILL YOU?
            ( screaming )
GIRL YOU HAVE THE DEVIL
IN YOU!
         YOU'RE RUNNING
         MY FEET OFF!
             AAAH!
    STOP WIGGLING!
HOLD STILL, CHILD!
         LET ME GO!!!
         LET ME GO!!!
         ( shouting )
STOP IT, CHILD!
BEHAVE YOURSELF!
      I COULD FIND YOU
      A QUIETER ONE IF YOU LIKE.
                         CHILD!
          ( coughing )
BE STILL, CHILD!
          SHOW HIM THE PENDANT.
OH, YES.
YOU'RE NO HELP, CHILD!
        Man:
        THAT IS AS DESCRIBED.
          LET ME GO!
              HOW DARE YOU!
          Man:
          I HAVE A MORE TERRIBLE
          LESSON FOR THIS CHILD.
        IT'S BEEN AN OVERLY LONG
        ADVENTURE LOCATING YOU.
     AS WE MAY BE TOGETHER
     FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME,
     YOUNG LADY,
        ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
        MYSELF.
Nun:
THAT LITTLE VIXEN
WILL BITE IT.
              MISS FLORA,
              MY NAME IS HIBBLE.
    YOUR MOTHER, MOLL FLANDERS,
                WAS A MURDERESS,
                WAS A MOTHER,
                AND A THIEF
            BY HER OWN ACCOUNT.
        THE LOSS OF HER SOUL,
        TO SOME,
WAS OF AS LITTLE CONSEQUENCE
          AS AN EMBER
          DRAFTING UP A CHIMNEY.
         I AM INSTRUCTED
         BY A WEALTHY BENEFACTOR
         TO OFFER YOU THE CHANCE
         TO ACCOMPANY ME.
              IN RETURN FOR YOUR
              BOARD AND KEEP,
        I AM TO READ YOU THIS--
        THE FIRSTHAND MEMOIRS
        OF YOUR MOTHER.
      YOUR BENEFACTOR HOPES THAT
      YOU MIGHT...
NOTE ANY SEEDS OF HER CHARACTER
        THAT MIGHT TRY TO...
        ROOT IN YOU.
    DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY WORDS?
      SHE DOESN'T RESPOND
      TO WORDS.
I'LL RESPOND TO ANYBODY
THAT TREATS ME
  LIKE I'VE GOT A SOUL
  AS GOOD AS THEM.
            INDEED, THERE IS
            MUCH OF HER IN YOU.
  WHAT IS IT?
I WAS SEPARATED FROM
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COIN
ON THE GROUNDS THAT ONLY SILK
WOULD SUFFICE.
            ARE YOU TAKING ME
            INTO SIN?
     I'LL SPEND TEN ETERNITIES--
YOU MAY REST EASY.
CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TAUGHT ME
THAT A MAN'S ETHICS
ARE THE ONLY POSSESSIONS
HE'LL TAKE BEYOND THE GRAVE.
PRAY DRESS YOURSELF.
  NOW TO BUSINESS.
"MY NAME IS MOLL FLANDERS.
 "I WAS BORN
 SOME THIRTY YEARS AGO
 IN A PRISON IN LONDON.
"BUT MY BODY, A FEMALE,
AND MY STATION...
        Moll Flanders:
  "...IS A PRISON OF THE FLESH
     "THAT I HAVE WORN FOR
     THE LENGTH OF MY LIFE.
   "CONVICTED FOR SOME THEFT
         SO SMALL
     "THAT ITS SIGNIFICANCE
 WAS LOST TO ALL MEMORY,
 "MY MOTHER GAVE UP HER VIRTUE
      TO A PRISON GUARD...
      ( woman screaming )
  Woman: PUSH! PUSH!
  "IN THE AGE OF REASON,EVEN
  THE ENGLISH WERE TOO GENTEEL
 "TO EXECUTE A PREGNANT WOMAN,
  "SO MY MOTHER RECEIVED NINE
 PRECIOUS EXTRA MONTHS OF LIFE
      "AND THEN WAS HANGED
     AS A THIEF THAT NIGHT.
     "DEPRIVED OF MY MOTHER
      BY THE AUTHORITIES,
     "I WAS DELIVERED
     TO THEIR MACHINE
     OF CIVIC LOVE,
       A HOME FOR ORPHANS
     AND FOUNDLINGS."

            BOY OR GIRL?!

( whispering )
MOLL. YOU--DON'T!
  YOU'RE MAD.
     QUIET!
WHAT IS THAT?!
              IT'S FOR THE POOR,
              MOTHER.
             BLESS ME, FATHER,
             FOR I HAVE SINNED.
             I HAD A JEALOUSY
             OF MARY BARNES
    AND I WISHED SISTER ORIAN
    WOULD DIE.
  HAVE YOU HAD
  IMPURE THOUGHTS,
  MY CHILD?
            I'VE BEEN
            THINKING OF YOU.
      OH.
AND WHAT ARE THOSE THOUGHTS,
MY CHILD?
HMM?
        IF I DID SOMETHING...
WHAT WOULD THAT BE,
MY CHILD?
                      THIS!
    AAAH!
             KEEP YOUR HANDS
             TO YOURSELF, SATAN.
Nun: CONFESS!
         HE'S THE SINNER!
STOP YOUR LYING,
MOLL FLANDERS!
            I AM NOT A LIAR!
                HE'S TOUCHED
                EVERY ONE OF US!
HOLD THE EVIL TONGUE!
    Priest: LIAR!
DAMNED FROM BIRTH,
JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER!
YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO WEAR
THE CROSS OF CHRIST!
    YOU TAKE THAT AND I'LL CALL
    THE DEVIL HIMSELF AFTER YOU!
YEAH?!
    SURE AS HELL ROASTS SOULS
              HE KNOWS WHAT
              YOU'VE BEEN DOING!
NO! LEAVE HER THE LORD'S SYMBOL,
FATHER. I'LL GET HER TO CONFESS.
  THEN DO IT!
 DO IT! DO IT!
     IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, MOLLY.
          HE'D BEAT YOU TO DEATH
          TO HOLD HIS POSITION.
     DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
IF YOU BELIEVE ME,
WHY WON'T YOU GO
TO THE BISHOP?
              YOU ARE SO YOUNG.
              LET THE LORD
              TAKE CARE OF THEM.
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE A SISTER TO DO GOOD.
         I DO...THE BEST I CAN.
YOU'RE SCARED OF HIM,
TOO, AREN'T YOU?
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO FEAR
ANY MAN OF FLESH AND BLOOD.
NO MATTER WHAT COSTUME HE WEARS.
 Moll: IF GOD MADE ME
 IN HIS IMAGE,
SHOULDN'T MY THOUGHTS
AND MY IDEAS BE LIKE HIS?
     ( flapping of wings,
        bird chirping )
  IF YOU HAVE ANY USE
  FOR MY MISERABLE LIFE...
    I PRAY HELP ME.
WHISPER IN MY HEART...
      A SIGN...
        DON'T BE LOSING
YOUR MENTAL PARTS, MOLL.
        ( bell tolls )
      ( bells continue )
        Nun:
        WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!
( birds chirping and singing )
        I AM A SPARROW.
     "DESPITE THE DEPRAVITY
           OF MY PAST
      "AND THE UNCERTAINTY
         OF MY FUTURE,
 "I SHARED A STRANGE JOY
      AMONGST THE LEAST OF
  THE LORD'S FEATHERED FLOCKS.
    "I HAD DISCOVERED
    A TRUTH OF NATURE:
"HOPE COMES TO THE YOUNG
AS NATURALLY AS SPRING RAINS--"
    MY MOTHER--
    DID YOU KNOW HER?
            CAN A MAN TRULY KNOW
            ANY WOMAN?
YOU'VE GOT A SNAKE
FOR A TONGUE, HAVEN'T YOU?
 YOU SAY HER BOOK TELLS HER
 AS A FOUL MURDERER,
 AND WORSE.
    WELL, SOME OF HER STORIES
    WERE QUITE UNPARALLELED.
 WHY WOULD ANYONE
 HELP THE DAUGHTER OF ONE
 SUCH AS THAT?
    PERHAPS TO DISCHARGE A DEBT.
JUST WHO IS MY BENEFACTOR?
         THE ANSWERS WILL COME,
        BUT NOT IF YOUR MOUTH
        IS WORKING HARDER
        THAN YOUR EARS.
JUST WHO IS MY BENEFACTOR?!
    EITHER YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE
    OR NO MANNERS.
     A WOMAN OF WEALTH
     HAS TAKEN UP YOUR INTEREST.
            ONE MRS. ALLWORTHY.
     DESPITE HER HIGH POSITION,
        SHE HAS EARNED
        A TERRIBLE REPUTATION
  FOR BEING INCITED TO CRUELTY.
        IT IS SUGGESTED
        SHE HAD TO LEAVE ENGLAND
    BECAUSE HER VEXATIOUS DEEDS
MIGHT HAVE GOT HER GULLET SLIT.
              I WARN YOU--
              CURB YOUR ANTICS.
AND YOU WOULD DELIVER ME
TO SUCH A PERSON? BLOODY HELL.
        IT IS MY FONDEST HOPE
        THAT YOUR SWEETNESS
        AND PURITY
            WILL TRANSFORM HER.
WHAT IS ME MOTHER'S PART
IN THIS MADNESS?
      YOUR MOTHER,
      GOD REST HER SOUL,
      WAS MRS. ALLWORTHY'S MAID.
I'M JUST THE DAUGHTER
OF SOME NINNY SERVANT GIRL?
            SHE WAS A REMARKABLE
            WOMAN.
HOW'D THIS REMARKABLE
MOTHER OF MINE DIE?
                 PUSH. PUSH.
        I HAVE PLANNED THIS TRIP
        TO THE LAST DETAIL,
            AND MY SCHEDULE
            WILL BE PLAYED OUT.
WELL, I HAVE THE NEED TO PEE
IN MY SCHEDULE.
     AS I SAID,
     I PLANNED FOR EVERY DETAIL.
    UGH.
        LORD. CHILD, HOW LONG
        CAN IT TAKE TO PEE?
    I SAY, AREN'T YOU DONE YET?
                      AH, DAMN!
     Man: WATCH YOURSELF!
        SEE, DAD'S RIGHT.
        IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAID.
             LET GO OF ME!
         CUNNING LITTLE WHIPPET,
         AIN'T SHE?
      YOU SON OF A WHORE
      AND A HORSE'S ASS!
AS I SAID,
I PLANNED FOR EVERY DETAIL.
                UGH!
                        AHH!
              NOW, WHERE WAS I?

 "...A STUDENT OF HER MYSTERIES.
 "SHE SOMETIMES PROVIDES
           A FORTUNE,
   AND SOMETIMES A DISASTER."
      I'M NOT GOING BACK!
Man: SHE'S A MADWOMAN!
         ( shouting )
     "BUT ONE CLEAR MESSAGE
      I STARTED TO GLEAN:
  NO MATTER WHAT YOUR STATION,
     NEVER SURRENDER HOPE."
                  GET IN THERE!
      "MY PELL-MELL FLIGHT
   HAD BROUGHT ME TO A SUBURB

                    AH.
            WELL, YOUNG LADY,
            I HAVE ARRANGED
        WITH THESE GENTLEFOLK
        OF GOOD CONSCIENCE
        TO TAKE IN SUCH STRAYS
        AS YOURSELF.
      DO NOT LET YOUR CONSCIENCE
      FAIL THEM,
     OR YOU WILL KNOW MY WRATH.
                UNDERSTAND ME?
  I MAY BE BORN FROM NOTHING,
            BUT...
I'VE ALL THE SENSE I NEED
     TO VALUE MY FORTUNE.
         WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.
       "SO, UNBELIEVABLY,
     LIKE SOME CINDERELLA,

 MY JOURNEY TO WOMANHOOD

 "LEARNING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
 OF A WELL-BROUGHT-UP YOUNG LADY

NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

              THAT'S JAIL FEVER!

¶ MOLLY'S GOT THE POX

    ¶ A TISSUE, A TISSUE
    ¶ WE ALL FALL DOWN
                IT'S NOT FUNNY.
          I SEE A SPOT
          ON HER CHEEK.
OOH, AND ANOTHER.
GOING TO SAVE A HANGING,
MOLL?
         ( chuckling )
            YOU WANT ME DEAD?
    DO FOR ME YOURSELF, THEN,
    GO ON.
      WE HAVE OUR BUTCHER

  THE SORT OF CHARITY

      A LIVING LESSON.

THAT'S IF I'M NOT
TOO EMBARRASSED TO BE
SEEN WITH YOU.
              I'M SURE IT'S JUST
              THE EXCITEMENT OF
              THE SEASON, MA'AM.
I WISH IT WAS, MOLL.
 "BY UNCONSCIOUS DESIGN,
 "I WAS BECOMING A STONE
 IN THE COMFORTABLE SHOE
      "OF THIS HOUSEHOLD.
     "I REALIZED I MIGHT BE
 STEALING SOMETHING I NEVER HAD:

THANK YOU, SIR.
    IF I WERE YOUNG,
    I'D MARRY MY DAUGHTERS
      AND I'D GET ME TO
      THE SUGAR ISLANDS.

        WHAT PLANS HAVE YOU
        FOR THE FUTURE,
        YOUNG LADY?
    WELL, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
 I'D BECOME A SISTER OF MERCY.
         BUT I RECKON
    THAT'S TOO HARD A ROAD
        FOR ANYONE WITH
    THEIR OWN IDEAS.
                  AND WHAT ARE
                  THOSE IDEAS?
  WELL, ONE DAY
  I WANT MY OWN COACH.
WITH A GLASS ROOF,
SO I CAN SEE THE STARS
AT NIGHT.
                HOW CHARMING.
 INDEED.
    ( both giggling )
     AHEM.
                 MOLL, ISN'T IT?
         YES.
                     THANK YOU.
LET ME HELP YOU SERVE, MOLL.
    MANY HANDS MAKE LIGHT WORK.
BUT I WANT TO REPAY
THE MAZZAWATTI'S HOSPITALITY.
    HE'S RIGHT.
    THIS IS YOUR FIRST CHRISTMAS
    AT YOUR FRIENDS' TABLE.
         LET US SHOW YOU
         OUR HOSPITALITY.
SERVE ME, JEREMY.
 MOLL'S FIRST.
 SHE'S THE GUEST.
 "THE MAZZAWATTI SISTERS PLANNED
 ACTS OF WAR AGAINST ME.
 THEIR WEAPONS WERE TO BE
 THEIR SUPERIOR CULTURE."
( playing chamber music )
  "I RETURNED THEIR ASSAULTS.
 "MY ARSENAL WAS SOMETHING FERAL
 THAT NATURE HAD PROVIDED ME...
     "A SENSE OF SELF
     THAT THESE WOMEN
     WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND,
      LET ALONE POSSESS."

          ITS NATURE."
    ( screaming, sobbing )
              WELL, YOUNG LADY.
    IT SEEMS YOUR CONSCIENCE
 HAS PROVED QUITE AN INSPIRATION
 TO THIS FAMILY.
THEY SOLD SOME OF
THEIR CHRISTMAS JEWELRY
TO RAISE FUNDS
FOR THE POOR.
SPARKED BY YOUR
ACTS OF KINDNESS,
THEY ENTERED AN AREA SO ROUGH
EVEN MY MEN GO IN SQUADS.
THE PRICE OF THEIR COMPASSION
WAS THEIR VIRTUE.

       "I COULD NOT STAY.

  THE RAWNESS OF THE DARK AIR,

NO! I WANT YOUR DUMB SERMON
OVER WITH.

    FOR NINE YEARS,
    I'VE SENT AGENTS
    TO SCOUR THE COUNTRYSIDE.

  HAVE SEARCHED EVERY PARSONAGE,
  CHARITY, AND WORKHOUSE

        LITTLE LOST DAUGHTER

  NOW YOU LISTEN OR SO HELP ME,
         I'LL RETURN YOU
         TO THAT PALACE OF GOD
         I JUST SPRUNG YOU FROM.
IS THAT PERFECTLY CLEAR TO YOU?
        DRIVE ON!

BEGGING YOUR PARDON,
SIR.
                    YES?
I HAVE A YOUNG LADY.
THANK YOU, SIR.

                GO ON.
COME IN, GIRL...

 STOPS MY BLOOD.
 "I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN

         OF MY DREAMS.

             WHAT MAKES YOU
             SO SPECIAL, MISS--?
     FLANDERS, MA'AM.
IT'S MOLL FLANDERS.
            MISS FLANDERS.
            WHAT'S YOUR NATURE?
          I'M LEARNING TO HAVE
          A VERY FAIR MANNER.
     LEARNING?
IT SEEMS TO BE A NECESSITY
IF ONE IS TO SUCCEED.
     SO...YOU'VE BEEN
     A TROUBLE MAKER.
                 I'VE JUST STOOD
                 FOR MY RIGHTS.
I CAN'T COUNTENANCE
POOR BEHAVIOR.
IT DISPLEASES MY GUESTS.
 ( laughter )
    YOUR LAST JOB?
         I'M STRONG FOR MY AGE.
I HAVE AN HONEST UPBRINGING,
MA'AM, AND I WON'T EAT TOO MUCH.
MEANING YOU HAVE
NO SKILLS AT ALL.
            I HAVE THE MEMORY
            NEVER TO BE TOLD
            A TASK TWICE.
            HIBBLE, MY HOUSE
            IS NOT A SCHOOL.
CAN YOU FIND IN YOUR HEART
TO TRY ME, PLEASE?
    IF YOU THINK ME LAZY
    OR I DISPLEASE YOU,
     THROW ME OUT,
     AND YOU'VE LOST NOTHING.
    MISS FLANDERS.
    WE HAVE A CONTRACT, THEN.
                HUBBLE, FIND HER
                SOME VICTUALS.
                  SHE'S SKINNY.
( laughter )
    YOU'VE GOT BRASS, GIRL.
          THERE'S NOT MANY
          STANDS UP TO HER.
     THAT WAS YOU?
  I COULD NEVER TURN THEM AWAY.
Man: STEADY! EASY THERE, EASY.
        ( moos )
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
                THE AMERICAS.
THAT'S THE END OF THE EARTH!
     YOU HAVE A REASON TO STAY?
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?
THEN I SHALL HAVE TO
TAKE MY CHANCES WITH
YOUR MISTRESS, SHAN'T I?
 I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU.
 LIKE YOU DID FOR MY MOTHER?
    ( indistinct chatter )
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
         I LOATHE SHIPS.
I WOULDN'T MIND MEETING
SOME PIRATES.
        OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.
AND THEY'D KILL YOU ALL
AND MAKE ME THEIR QUEEN.
                  OH, REALLY.
THEY SAY THIS
IS JUST A CHANNEL,
AND IT GETS WORSE
IN THE ATLANTIC.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
MY MOTHER WAS EVIL. AWFUL.
I SHALL NEVER FOLLOW
IN HER FOOTSTEPS.
DOES THAT SATISFY YOU?
    SO THROW AWAY THE CROSS.
    WHAT?
IF YOU REJECT HER,
THEN THROW AWAY THE CRUCIFIX.
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I HAVE OF HERS.
            THEN I MUST ON
            WITH HER JOURNAL.
                 DAMN, MY EYES.
YOUR MISTRESS MUST INDEED
BE AN EVIL BANSHEE
IF YOU'RE MORE SCARED OF HER
THAN YOU ARE OF THESE WATERS.
            THERE ARE MORE
            COMPELLING MOTIVES
            THAN FEAR.

"MRS. ALLWORTHY'S CONSTANT--"
ARE YOU LISTENING?
WELL, I'M NOT DEAF, AM I?
      "MRS. ALLWORTHY'S CONSTANT
      CONTENTION WAS...
         "THAT ALL MEN
      ARE FORTUNE HUNTERS,
 "AND, THEREFORE, ARE FAIR GAME

  "AND THAT WOMEN, LOGICALLY,
     MIGHT AS WELL BE
      "TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
 BY ONE OF THEIR OWN SEX
  THAN JUST GIVE THEMSELVES TO
 MEN AND SEE NO PROFIT IN IT."
     AH, FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING,
     FLORA,
              THIS IS RATHER...
                    DELICATE.
             DO YOU KNOW WHAT
             THE MALE AND FEMALE
             WERE INTENDING?
SURE. I'VE SEEN DOGS
IN THE STREET DOING IT.
                 YES, WELL,
                 IT'S NOT QUITE
                 THE SAME THING.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE NOT A DOG.
                          HUH.
        "MRS. ALLWORTHY NEVER
        FORCED A WOMAN...
       "INTO HER SERVICE.
       "BUT, LIKE A GOOD
         HORSE TRAINER,
 "SHE MADE SURE THAT THE PROCESS
       BECAME SO FAMILIAR

Mrs. Allworthy ( in distance ):
HIBBLE!
  MR. HIBBLE!
WHERE THE DEVIL ARE YOU?
            Hibble:
        OH, GOD.
     SHE'LL TEAR THE HIDE
     OFF ME.
                Woman: YOU WON'T
                PRATTLE ON US?
MR. HIBBLE!
              I SAW HIM.
YOU, GIRL?
WHERE?
      IN-IN THE KITCHEN.
        WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
        ARE YOU BEING WITH HIM?
NO, UH, I WAS LOOKING
FOR A PLACE TO REST.
            I CAN SEE INTO
            YOUR LYING SOUL.
        ARE YOU HIDING SOMETHING
        ON ME?
NOTHING. GOD'S TRUTH--
YOU BETTER NOT HAVE BEEN
WITH HIM!
  YOU LAZY TROLLOP.
YOU WORK, OR YOU LEAVE.
                        MOLL.
         I'M A MAN OF GRATITUDE,
         MOLL.
                 I'LL REMEMBER.
     YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE.
    FOR A LIAR.
WAS HE HURTING YOU?
                  HURTING ME?
                ( laughs )
                YOU'LL LEARN.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
        GOD MUST HAVE
        A DARK SENSE OF HUMOR...
            GIVING MEN
            THEM STUPID WHACKERS
            AND US THE DESIRE
            TO TAKE THEM IN.
    BUT IT PASSES NEAR TO
    THE BEGINNING OF CREATION
      FOR A FEELING IN YOUR BODY
      IF IT'S DONE RIGHT.
    AND THAT'S SOMETHING
    THAT SOW CAN'T TAKE AWAY.
    ( knock at door )
         COME.
         WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?
WENT TO A GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE.
             COME ON, GET WARM.
SOME GENTLEMAN IF HE
DIDN'T PAY FOR A CARRIAGE.
            MRS. A WOULDN'T
            LET US GET A CAB.
SHE'D RATHER KEEP THE MONEY.
UH-UH. DON'T WASTE MY WOOD.
         BUT POLLY'S COLD.
YOU KNOW BETTER.
         IF SHE STAYED AT
         THE FEVER HOME,
HOW MUCH WOULD SHE EARN YOU?
( laughs )
SET FIRE TO HER IF YOU WANT.
NOW, YOU,
COME DRESS ME.
      Mrs. Allworthy:
      EXTREMELY PROFITABLE
      EVENING LAST NIGHT.
    MONEY'S A FAITHFUL DOG.
    NEVER ASKS NOTHING,
    GUARDS AND COMFORTS
    LIKE A FRIEND.
BUT YOU GOTTA KEEP IT CLOSE.
STRAP ME UP, GIRL.
TAKEN MY FINGERS TO THE BONE,
I HAVE,
TRYING TO BREED THIS DOG.
      DAY OR NIGHT,
GONNA BE ONE DEAD ROBBER
    TRIES TO SEPARATE ME
    FROM MY HOUND.
    I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND
    ABOUT YOU.
     I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
     GRATEFUL OR NOT.
             I'M WORKING MY BEST
             TO SHOW IT, MA'AM.
NO, YOU AIN'T SHOWED
YOUR BEST.
THAT'S FOR YOU TO
CATCH THE MEN WITH,
MAKE US BOTH HAPPY.
 FETCH MY GOWN.
 NO, THE BLUE ONE.
IT'S SUNDAY.
CAN'T WEAR RED ON SUNDAY.
MOTHER OF GOD,
YOU'LL HAVE THE BLUE-NOSES
DOWN ON US.
            FOR WEARING RED?
FOR EVERYTHING
THEM AND THEIR WOMEN ARE NOT.
I'VE GOTTA TAKE YOU IN HAND.
             HMM.
 A MAN'S NOTHING BUT A BULL...
        BEAST OF LUST.
SAY ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING
TO EASE HIS URGES.
  GOD'S NOT MADE A MAN
  FIT TO BE WOVEN UP WITH YET.
BUT THERE'S PRECIOUS FEW WOMEN
     WHO LEARN TO LEAD THEM
     BY THE NOSE.
THESE ARE THE MOST AWESOME
WEAPONS YOU HAVE, GIRL.
         PROP THEM UP,
 AND A MAN WON'T BE ABLE
 TO RAISE HIS EYES TO YOUR FACE.
  SIT DOWN.
SOME OF THE FINEST GENTLEMEN
IN LONDON COME THROUGH MY DOORS.
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO
HAVE POWER OVER SUCH MEN?
SO ALL THEY COULD THINK OF
WAS WORSHIPPING YOUR YOUNG BODY?
         I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC.
SO WAS THE VIRGIN MARY,
AND DON'T TELL ME
SHE DIDN'T DO IT.
              THAT'S BLASPHEMY.
NO, THAT'S COMMON SENSE,
GIRL.
WHAT ARE YOU
SAVING YOURSELF FOR?
GIVE YOURSELF SOME PLEASURE.
LIFE'S TERRIBLE SHORT FOR SOME.
YOU NEVER BEEN KISSED, I'LL BET.
  AND WHY?
TWO FLAT PIECES OF FISH
WHERE THERE OUGHT TO BE
A RED RING OF ALLURE.
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
THE INNOCENCE OF A DOLL.
THEY WANTS THE CHILD IN YOU.
AND THE EYES.
TEASE THEM DOWN THERE
WITH YOUR EYES.
WHEN A MAN'S PART GOES HARD,
HIS BRAIN GOES SOFT.
THAT'S WHEN THEY'LL SAY
OR DO ANYTHING TO POSSESS YOU.
THAT'S WHEN YOU FEEL THE POWER.
         DID YOU HAVE THIS POWER
         OVER SOMEONE?
 EVERY MAN WHO COMES
 THROUGH MY DOOR.
                         MOLL.
WAS SHE BULLING YOU
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?
        NO. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
    THANKS.
EDNA AND ME...
WELL, IT'S NOT LOVE.
WE HAVE AN EAR FOR
EACH OTHER'S TROUBLES,
YOU KNOW?
SHE'S NOT SO YOUNG ANYMORE.
I DON'T WANT THE MISTRESS
AFTER HER.
             WHAT WOULD SHE DO?
SHE'S CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.
        ( door opens )
THERE'S NO HEART
IN THE WOMAN.
                     ( sighs )
ESCAPED FROM CARDIFF
PRISON HULKS, I DID.
WITH A HIGHWAY ALCHEMIST
NAMED GAY.
OH. HE COULD TURN THE LEAD
IN HIS PISTOLS TO GOLD.
MRS. ALLWORTHY
WAS HIS ACQUAINTANCE.
SHE HID HIM AND ME.
BUT HE DIED FROM A SHOT
HE TOOK WHILE ESCAPING.
FOR A WHILE, SHE AND I...
LORD, MAKES ME STRANGE
TO SAY THE WORDS.
WE SHARED THE SAME BED.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DONE WRONG,
BUT SHE TURNED ON ME.
    SUDDEN.
SHE WON'T TOUCH ME,
BUT SHE WON'T SET ME FREE.
    HERE.
      THIEF.
ONE WORD FROM HER
AND MY OWN SKIN WILL HANG ME.
             I'VE GOT THIS THING
             IN MY HEAD.
  WHAT THING?
 IF THE LIKES OF MRS. ALLWORTHY
             CAN HAVE THE GENTRY
             DANCE TO HER TUNE,
    I COULD HAVE EVERYTHING--
  NO, MOLL, NO.
A WORD FROM AN OLD PILGRIM:
GET YOURSELF OUT OF HERE.
FIND A FARMER.
BE A MILLINER'S WIFE.
HAVE A COMMON MAN
COME HOME TO YOU, LASS.
DON'T TRAVEL HER ROAD.
NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT.
    WITH HER MONEY,
    I'D KNOW HOW TO BE HAPPY.
         ( footsteps )
MR. HIBBLE!
OH, LORD, COME QUICK!
COME ON, LADIES, COME ON.
STAND ASIDE, STAND ASIDE.
            ( crying )
             WHAT'S HAPPENED?
      POLLY KILLED THE PIE MAN.
         SHE MURDERED HIM?
NAH, THE OLD GEEZER
WOULD GIVE US A PIE OR TWO
FOR A TWIST IN THE LARDER.
         CAN'T TOUCH HIM
         CAN'T TOUCH--
        DAMN, POLLY, NOW WE
        AIN'T NEVER GONNA GET
        ANY DECENT FOOD.
AW, BUT YOU SHOULD LOOK
AT THE SMILE ON HIS FACE.
         ( laughter )
Mrs. Allworthy: FIVE GUINEAS?
NOW, SURELY, GENTLEMEN...
           "I DECIDED
   THIS WASN'T PROSTITUTION.
 "THAT HAPPENED ON STREET
 CORNERS AND BACK ALLEYS.
 "THIS WAS MAKING FRIENDS
   WITH ELIGIBLE GENTLEMEN--
          NOBLE, RICH
     PROSPECTIVE HUSBANDS."
        THIS IS NOT
        ONE OF THOSE YOUNG GIRLS
 WHO SWEAR TO THEIR VIRGINITY
    AND THEN GET YOU DRUNK
    SO THAT YOU DON'T NOTICE
    THE DIFFERENCE.
         ( laughter )
  NO, THIS IS THE REAL THING.
ALL THE MYSTERIES OF EVE
WAITING TO BE UNRAVELED.
    NOW, WHICH OF YOU
        NOBLE GENTLEMEN
    IS GOING TO TAKE
      THIS GENTLE FLOWER
      TO THE FULL BLOSSOM
    OF HER WOMANHOOD?
( men murmuring )
            FIFTEEN GUINEAS.
FIFTEEN GUINEAS IT IS.
DO I HEAR TWENTY?
          I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY!
             CHRIST, MOLL,
             DON'T SELL YOURSELF
             FOR THE BITCH.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
                 FORTY GUINEAS!
FORTY GUINEAS FOR SIR WILLIAM
AND HIS LOVELY LITTLE DOG.
                      LOVELY!
    ANYONE FOR FORTY-FIVE?
  NOW, GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN,
 THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE NIGHT
IN THIS YOUNG LADY'S LIFE
  IN WHICH, LIKE A FINE WINE,
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TASTE
HER INNOCENCE.
          ( men chortling )
Man: FIFTY GUINEAS.
             FIFTY GUINEAS!
         WELL DONE!
         DO I HEAR FIFTY-FIVE?
      I BID FIFTY-FIVE GUINEAS!
    FIFTY-FIVE IT IS,
    YOUR LORDSHIP.
      SIXTY? SIXTY GUINEAS!
    DO I HEAR SIXTY-FIVE?
SIXTY-FIVE!
        I HAVE SIXTY-FIVE.
        DO I HEAR SEVENTY?
                     ONE HUNDRED
                     GUINEAS.
  ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS!
  THAT'S PUT A PRICE ON HER!
         ANYONE ELSE?
        ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS
        IS A DONE THING.
                  BRAVO! BRAVO!
PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE PLEASURES
OF A LIFETIME.
  THANK YOU.
I CAN'T.
NOT HIM. PLEASE.
                FOR GOD'S SAKE,
                SHE'S NOT READY.
SHUT UP.
FOR 100 GUINEAS
I'D PUT HER IN BED
WITH THE DEVIL.
NOW, I HOPE I HAVEN'T
WASTED MY TIME WITH YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
SOME BONE IN YOUR BACK.
HERE. FIND YOURSELF.
GO ON. GO ON.
BUT DO HIM GOOD,
OR YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME.
  ALL RIGHT.

   FOR THE MYSTERY OF LIFE--

I'LL GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

              WHY'D YOU PICK ME,
              ANYWAY?
  'CAUSE YOU WERE
  THE CHEAPEST.
            NOW, THERE'S A BLOW.
  I WANTED TO...
  PAINT A WOMAN.
                  YOU PAID JUST
                  TO LOOK AT ME?
WHAT'S WRONG?
    IT'S THE STRANGE ONES
    THAT HURT PEOPLE LIKE ME.
    GIN...
    OR WHISKEY?
I BELIEVE I COULD GET
A BOTTLE OF SOMETHING NEARBY.
        MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.
            COME ON, MISTER.
        ( Moll sighs )
      ( door opens
    and closes )
        HELLO.
ALL I COULD FIND WAS WHISKEY.
            IT'S ALL RIGHT.
     DON'T TOUCH THAT.
              WHY NOT?
        OH, GOD!
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
        YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME!
NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
                PLEASE DON'T!
    YOU'RE NOT GONNA HURT ME?
     NO.
NOT UNLESS I FALL ON YOU.
                    TRUE?
     YES.
                YOU BASTARD!
        YOU SCARED ME TO DEATH!
I MAY BE AN IGNORANT TROLLOP,
BUT I STILL GOT FEELINGS,
YOU KNOW.
I APOLOGIZE.
SPEECH IS NOT
MY FIRST LANGUAGE.
I ATTEMPT TO MAKE A LIVING
DOING THESE STUDIES.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
I'M AN ARTIST OR A SCIENTIST.
LIFE FASCINATES ME.
EVERYTHING HAS A PURPOSE.
THE WAY OUR HEARTS WORK,
THE WAY OUR VERY BLOOD FLOWS
AROUND OUR BODY
ALL FITS TOGETHER
IN A BRILLIANT SYSTEM.
BUT PART OF ME REALLY YEARNS
TO CATCH WHAT TRULY ANIMATES
  OUR HUMAN CLAY.
            WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANT TO SEE WHO
I REALLY BOUGHT.
                        WHY?
BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE
A DROWNED CLOWN.
                     SO DO YOU.
THERE USED TO BE MORE OF ME.
            BUT THE BOOZE
            IS THINNING ME DOWN.
         MUST HAVE DRANK HIMSELF
         TO DEATH.
                  ( chuckles )
COULD YOU PLEASE
KEEP A LITTLE MORE STILL?
    I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SLEEP.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
            WITH ALL THESE
            DEAD FOLKS' PARTS
            LYING AROUND.
    WHAT KIND OF PERSON
    WOULD LET YOU CUT THEM UP
    LIKE SUNDAY JOINTS?
PEOPLE WILL THEM TO SCIENCE.
                 WELL, THIS BODY
                 AIN'T WILLING.
     NO MATTER HOW CHEAP IT GOES
     WHEN IT'S ALIVE.
        YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD,
        ARE YOU?
             I DON'T HAVE AN EGG
             FOR A HEAD.
I'M ONLY STARTING.
IT'S REMBRANDT'S
LINES OF FORM.
        I WOULDN'T COPY HIM,
        NOT IF HE PAINTED PEOPLE
        WITH EGGS FOR HEADS.
DO YOU REALLY NOT KNOW
WHO REMBRANDT IS?
            NOT EVEN IF
            I'D SLEPT WITH HIM.
     MAYBE THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
            YOU CAN'T LIVE
            SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.
         YOU'VE GOT TO DO THINGS
         YOUR OWN WAY.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN
AND LET ME SEE
WHAT I'VE PAID FOR.
A CARRIAGE?
HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR SENSES?
          FOUND 'EM, MORE LIKE.
DIDN'T I WARN YOU?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FEET?
                    NOTHING!
        HE WANTS ME EVERY NIGHT
        FOR THE NEXT FORTNIGHT.
        A CARRIAGE EACH WAY.
        YOU?
            ( coins jingle )
                    ME.
        WHATEVER YOU DID TO HIM,
        TEACH IT TO THE OTHERS.
I NEVER TOUCHED HIM.
     I'M SHIVERING.
     I'VE GOT BLOODY GOOSEBUMPS.
                  ( chuckles )
    MISSED.
         I WASN'T AIMING AT YOU.
YES, YOU WERE.
                  WEREN'T.
          DID I MISS THAT TIME?
WOULD YOU PLEASE
SIT STILL?
                 I TOLD YOU,
                 I'M FREEZING.
                 IT'S FREEZING.
JUST SIT THERE...
AND HOLD THIS.
    IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
    A MIRROR OF ME.
          IT'S GOOD?
( dejected )
BRILLIANT.
        IT'S NOT GOOD?
IT'S JUST...
IT'S JUST SO DAMN
MECHANICAL!
          I'M THERE.
YES, THIS MUSCLE
IS CONNECTED TO THIS TISSUE...
DA VINCI COULD HAVE MADE
YOUR EYE DANCE WITH
A TOUCH OF LIGHT FROM HIS BRUSH,
BUT HE WASN'T PAINTING
THE THING, THE BODY,
HE WAS CAPTURING ITS...
ITS SPIRIT.
         WELL, THE SPIRITS IN ME
         COST TUPPENCE A QUART,
         LOVE.
( chuckles )
YOU'VE THE DEVIL'S SPIRIT
IN YOU, ALL RIGHT.
         THERE'S NOTHING IN ME.
              HARD LIKE A ROCK.
                THAT WAY THERE'S
                NOTHING INSIDE
                TO GET CONFUSED.
AND THE MOON IS MADE
OF GREEN CHEESE.
          COME.
        YOU SEE THE RESTRICTIONS
        OF YOUR MORTAL BODY?
            CLOSE YOUR EYES.
                INSIDE YOU...
         THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE.
                 THE COSMOS.
                YOU SEE?
     INSIDE, YOU GO ON FOREVER.
     I'M STONE.
YOU WANT TO PAINT
ANOTHER ONE?
                          NO.
I'M JUST THE WRONG WOMAN.
  IT'S NOT YOU.
    I DON'T THINK THESE HANDS
    WILL EVER CAPTURE YOU.
 YOU'RE A KIND MAN.
     ( thunder crashing )
             Driver: WHOA.
                 GIDDYUP.
                 HELLO?
     HELLO?
                         HELLO.
      AAAH!
                 THAT'S THE LAST
                 OF THEM.
          TEACH HER THE LESSON.
             Moll:
             I DIDN'T KNOW
             WHERE ELSE TO GO.
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?
                    IT HAPPENS.
  CAREFUL, JONATHAN,
  THIS IS NO STRAY KITTEN.
  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
  KIND OF PERSON YOU'RE
  LETTING IN YOUR HOUSE.
STRANGELY, I FIND
THE MYSTERY INTRIGUING.
SEND FOR ME IF SHE
HAS ANY SIGN OF TREMORS.
OTHERWISE,
IT'LL BE A BAD FEW DAYS
BEFORE SHE'S COMFORTABLE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
                I NEED A DRINK.
THAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU NEED.
            DAMN YOU, DO YOU
            KNOW HOW I FEEL?
ANGRY, FRIGHTENED, LOST--
THAT'S HOW I'D FEEL.
        I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.
      HE'S RIGHT, YOU DON'T NEED
      MY KIND IN YOUR HOUSE.
    GENTLY.
IS IT ME YOU DON'T TRUST?
YOU'RE HURT. STAY.
             I WON'T HAVE A MAN
             TELL ME WHAT TO DO!
ALL RIGHT THEN,
PLEASE STAY.
                  NO.
LEAVE THEN.
BANISH YOURSELF.
     I'M TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO.
     DO YOU HEAR ME?
MY LIFE'S NOT SOME GAME.
              MINE NEITHER.
            WELL...GOOD-BYE.
DAMN YOU. I HAVEN'T GOT
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO!
    I'LL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR.
NO, I'LL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR.
        YOU ARE THE MOST
        CONTENTIOUS PERSON
        I'VE EVER MET!
YOU HAVEN'T LIVED MUCH
THEN, HAVE YOU?
      "DAYS PASSED QUICKLY
       IN MY NEW CAREER.
 "IN EXCHANGE FOR PARTICIPATING
 "IN THE QUEST TO CAPTURE
 MY SOUL IN PIGMENTS AND OILS,
 "I WAS GIVEN FOOD AND LODGING
         BY A MAN
     WHO SUBJECTED HIMSELF
     TO INTERNAL TORTURES."
 DAMN!
      LET'S NOT STAY IN TODAY.
      LET'S GO DO SOMETHING FUN.
JUST A SECOND.
     THIS THEN. JUST LIKE THAT.
I CAN'T SEE YOU.
                     GOT IT?
     AAH!
IS THIS ANYONE YOU KNOW?
                 A RICH WIDOW
                 FROM WIMBLEDON.
 ( chuckles )
HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T
CUT ANYONE UP
SINCE I GOT HERE?
                I DIDN'T WANT TO
                DISCONCERT YOU.
WELL,
THAT'S YOUR INCOME.
FROM THE LOOKS OF
YOUR SCRAWNY BODY
AND THIS PLACE,
YOU HAVEN'T GOT TWO PENCE
TO RUB TOGETHER.
YOU'RE A DESPERATE MAN
TO PAY TO PAINT ME,
I'LL TELL YA THAT.
             BUT EVERYTHING'S ON
             THE SURFACE, MOLL.
    THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS
    OF DESPERATION.
LIKE WHAT?
        Artist:
        THE MAD HERMIT THAT I AM
  LIVED A WILD LIFE AS A CHILD.
        I MADE WINGS FROM CANVAS
        AND BAMBOO.
     I WISHED TO NAVIGATE
     THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE A BIRD.
      INSTEAD, I STUDIED GRAVITY
      AND PLUNGED 40 FEET FROM
      THE MILL ROOF.
  MY BODY LAY STATIC FOR WEEKS,
          BUT MY MIND TRAVELED
          TO PLACES IN FEVERS
     THAT ARE STILL VIVID IN ME.
            ONE MAN CAME
            AND WAS BY MY SIDE
            DAY AND NIGHT,
        A VERY OLD DOCTOR,
            TOUCHED, I AM TOLD,
            BY MY INVENTIVENESS.
          HE EXHAUSTED HIMSELF.
I'M STILL HERE, OLD MAN.
STILL TESTING THE WINDS,
        THANKS TO YOU.
MY PARENTS TREATED ME
AS AN INVALID.
FREQUENTLY I WOULD
GET SICKLY
JUST TO REINFORCE
THEIR SMOTHERINGS.
I CAME TO LONDON
TO BECOME A KNIGHT OF MEDICINE.
BUT MY STAMINA IS INSUFFICIENT
FOR THE WORK OF A PHYSICIAN,
SO I DEDICATED MY DRAWING
TO HELPING THOSE WHO ARE
BETTER SPECIMENS.
  ( bird calls in distance )
 THAT CHILD IN ME
 YEARNED TO CREATE
 THE EXTRAORDINARY--
  A PARTHENON,
A SISTINE CHAPEL.
     AND NOW...
I THINK I'D SETTLE
FOR CREATING ANYTHING
 THAT WOULD GIVE ME
 A SENSE OF COMPLETION.
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM LIFE, MOLL?
            NOTHIN' ANYMORE.
COME ON, MOLL.
I BARE MY SOUL--
          AND I BARE MY BOSOMS.
WE MAKE A GOOD PAIR.
        ( loud chatter
        and laughter )
                    MOLL.
     NOW, THERE'S A SIGHT.
        CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
        PRIVATE-LIKE?
         YEAH.
HIBBLE, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?
  MOLL, THINGS AIN'T GONE RIGHT.
  WHAT'S WRONG?
HELLO, MOLLY.
DRIVEN OFF BY
THE GUARDIANS OF MORALS,
WE WERE.
LOST MY HOUSE, MY GIRLS...
GETTING OUT OF NEWGATE
COST ME MY COMFORT, GIRL,
MY FAITHFUL DOG.
SHE'S LOOKING SO GOOD.
ISN'T SHE, HIBBLE?
SO NICELY ATTIRED.
I THINK SHE'S BEEN FINDING
WHILE WE'VE BEEN LOSING.
    WHAT DO YOU WANT?
 I TOOK YOU IN.
PUT A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD.
KEPT YOU WHILE YOU WAS
ON THE BOOZE.
NOW YOU'RE COMING BACK,
AND YOU'RE GONNA WORK FOR ME.
            I'M BEYOND YOU NOW.
COME WITH ME OR I'LL PUT YOU
BEYOND EVERYTHING.
        MOLL,
        SHE DIDN'T TELL ME THIS.
I MEAN IT.
WHAT'S GOING ON,
MOLL?
  IS THAT YOUR BUSINESS?
         MORE THAN YOU THINK.
            OH, YOU GOT YOURSELF
            A LOVER BOY, MOLLY.
             HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED
             ABOUT MEN YET?
      HE'LL BURN YOU.
      YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH ME.
DON'T DOUBT I WILL USE THIS.
    ONE SMALL SHOT LIKE THAT,
    SO FEW GRAINS OF POWDER,
            MIGHT KILL ME,
            MOST LIKELY NOT.
        BUT I SWEAR
        I'LL LIVE LONG ENOUGH
     TO RUN THIS BLADE
     THROUGH YOUR BODY SIX TIMES
    AND DANCE UPON YOUR GRAVE
    BEFORE I DROP.
  Woman:
  SOMEONE GET A MAGISTRATE!
              NOT HERE...
              NOT TODAY.
    YOU AIN'T WORTH MY SPIT.
LET ALONE MY NECK.
I'LL HAVE MEMORY OF THIS.
YOU'LL PAY ME.
                 I ALREADY DID.
 MOLL, I'M SORRY.
         HERE, HAVE SOME BREAD.
I'M SORRY.
                  WAS THAT GUN
                  THAT USELESS?
        I LIED.
         AND...
RATHER WELL, I THOUGHT.
         WELL?
TAKE YOUR BOOTS OFF.
             YOU HAVE YOURS ON.
I HAVEN'T BEEN OUTDOORS.
      THIS IS VERY UNIMPORTANT.
ANGRY 'CAUSE I
CLEANED FOR YOU?
    DON'T DO THIS AGAIN.
    I'LL NEVER FIND ANYTHING.
THERE. BACK WHERE IT WAS.
     GOD, THAT FELT GOOD!
        ( both laugh )
         "FOR A WHILE,
      OUR LIVES WENT ON...
     TWO STRANGE COMPANIONS
 IN THE CIRCLES OF LIFE."
            MADAM.
          I WASN'T LONG, WAS I?
            "NO, MOLL.
            NOT LONG AT ALL."
         THAT'S A FINE PERFUME.
            SHE WAS VERY PRETTY.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS COMING.
AGAIN.
    IF SHE'S WHAT YOU NEED--
THERE ARE THINGS
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU.
    YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL
    THE LIKES OF ME ANYTHING.
         LET'S JUST
         GET THIS OVER WITH.
         CIVILIZED. I'M LEAVING.
SLOW DOWN, DAMN YOU.
THAT WOMAN WAS MY SISTER.
SHE BRINGS ME MEDICINES.
A LITTLE MONEY FROM MY FAMILY.
     HOW DOES HER KIND LIKE
     YOU HAVING ME FOR A LODGER?
IT'S NOT FOR HER TO KNOW.
        SO YOU DON'T WANT HER
        TO KNOW.
 IT'S HER I DON'T TRUST.
            IT'S ALL A MISTAKE.
EITHER I WANT YOU COMMITTED,
OR I WANT YOU
TO FREE YOURSELF NOW.
                     COMMITTED?
    TO ME.
                         WHAT?!
EVERY NIGHT
WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP,
 I LOOK AT YOU
AND I FEAR ONE THING--
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE HERE.
          DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
          I'M GOING TO FAIL YOU.
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.
                 NO, FEEL THAT!
            THAT'S NOTHING
            COMPARED TO THE PAIN
            THAT COMES WITH ME!
LET ME LOVE YOU.
      DO I HIDE WHEN YOUR FAMILY
      COME TO VISIT?
I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
         "THEY HUNG HER MOTHER."
         FEEL THAT!
            "SHE SLEPT WITH
            HUNDREDS OF MEN!"
            FEEL THAT!
            "SHE'S A BITCH
            AND A TROLLOP!"
            AND I HATE YOU!
            THIS IS MADNESS!
              FORGOT ME BLEEDIN'
              STUPID SHOES.
PUT THEM UNDER THE BED,
MOLL.
          "I'D HAD SEX
     WITH MANY A MAN,
  "BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
         I'D MADE LOVE.
      "HE WILLED HIS SOUL
         INTO ME.
         "WE WERE ONE,
      "A FUSION OF PASSION
 AND UNSPOKEN KNOWLEDGES.
 "WE WERE A UNITED FORCE
   PUSHING BACK THE DARKNESS
 IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES."
            IS SOMETHING WRONG?
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I HAD TO BE RICH
TO OWN THE STARS.
                     MOLL...
      I WANT YOU TO BE MY WIFE.
WAKE ME UP IN THE MORNING
AND SAY THAT.
                    I MEAN IT.
WE'LL SEE
IF THERE'S SOME CHANCE
WITH YOUR FAMILY FIRST.
THEN I'LL ANSWER.
                 IF YOU SAY SO.
                  FEELING COLD?
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M FEELING.
      ( sheep bleating )
                WELCOME!
                WELCOME HOME!
IS THAT YOUR FATHER?
IS THAT HIM?
        NO, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
        THAT EASY, MOLL.
         WELCOME HOME!
      THE MASTER'S HOME!
        STEADY, BOY, STEADY.
                WHOA, WHOA.
      NO.
                        YES.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
      WELL, THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.
      OH, GOD.
NO, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THIS IS MOLL FLANDERS.
 HELLO.
    NO, MOLL.
THIS IS MY MOTHER,
AND THIS IS MY SISTER
CHARLOTTE.
        IT'S A PLEASURE
        TO MEET YOU FORMALLY.
  THE PAINTINGS--
  I FEEL LIKE WE'VE ALREADY MET.
YEAH, WELL, I'M SURE YOU'VE
NEARLY SEEN ALL OF ME.
            YOUR FATHER WILL BE
            JOINING US. PLEASE.
         WELL, AT LEAST HIS BODY
         IS WORKING WELL.
      Servant:
      IS THERE ANYTHING
      YOU WOULD WISH FOR, MA'AM?
                     Moll: NO.
        WE'LL HAVE SOME WINE.
YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER
FEELS ABOUT ALCOHOL.
         SOME RED WINE, GARETH.
            I BROUGHT IT WITH ME
            IN THE CARRIAGE.
          MOLL, LET ME EXPLAIN
          THE LITTLE HYPOCRISIES
          OF MY FAMILY.
 ALL THIS COMES FROM THE SUCCESS
 OF THE FAMILY'S BREWERIES.
     IT IS
     AN HONEST BUSINESS.
         PROFITING FROM THE SINS
         OF THE LITTLE MAN.
WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO,
MISS FLANDERS?
            UM, CONVENT OF
            THE SACRED HEART.
        NICE PLACE, SORT OF.
IT PROVIDES WORK
FOR THE INDOLENT.
 IT IS AN HONEST BUSINESS.
  BUT PLEASE, LET US NOT
  SPOIL WHAT IS TRUTHFULLY
  A WONDROUS OCCASION.
MY SON HAS RETURNED HOME.
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY.
      BUT WE CAN SHARE
      ALL THAT LATER.
     BUT GOD SO HELP ME,
     IF YOU...
    WANTED A WOMAN AT LAST,
     SURELY YOU COULD HAVE
     PAID FOR ONE.
    OH, I DID.
    MOLL IS MY MODEL.
        AND MY FIANCEE.
FOR A FEW PENNIES,
SHE'S HELPED ME FIND MYSELF--
          AN EXPERIENCE
          YOU'VE DENIED ME
          FOR THE DURATION
          OF MY EXISTENCE.
         PATIENCE.
    Mother: MY DEAR...
  IT'S OBVIOUS MY SON
  FINDS YOU VERY ATTRACTIVE.
    WHATEVER YOU WISH--
         NAME IT.
A THOUSAND GUINEAS?
FIVE THOUSAND?
TEN THOUSAND?
        HERE.
 THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN
 YOU COULD EARN IN A LIFETIME.
YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF
A FUTURE
WITHOUT TAKING MY SON'S AWAY.
  ALL MY LIFE I'VE DREAMT
  OF OWNING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
FUNNY, I THOUGHT I'D FEEL MORE.
             I KNOW WHO I AM...
             AND WHAT I'VE BEEN.
          AND SO DOES YOUR SON.
    I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE
    THERE'D BE SOME CHANCE
    I'D FIT INTO YOUR FAMILY.
      THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ME
      THE PROUDEST LIVING THING.
      BUT NO ONE CAN SEPARATE ME
      FROM THIS MAN.
    UNLESS HE TELLS ME
    HE WANTS ME TO LEAVE HIM.
              I LOVE HIM ENOUGH
              TO DO THAT.
     BUT YOU CAN'T BUY ME AWAY.
Father: THIS IS
ALL MY FAULT, YOU KNOW.
  I SWEAR, IT IS MY MISTAKE.
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER SENT THE BOY
TO SCHOOL IN LONDON.
        OBSERVE, MOLL.
     GREAT MONEY DOES NOT
      A GREAT HUMAN MAKE.
  MY SON TELLS ME
  THAT I HAVE NEVER
  DEMONSTRATED LOVE FOR HIM.
    WELL, LET ME SEE
    HOW I CAN DO THAT.
    WELL, I CAN AT LEAST
    PROTECT HIM.
    IF YOU MARRY HER,
     I SHALL NOT ONLY
     DISINHERIT YOU,
 I SHALL EXCOMMUNICATE YOU.
AS GOD IS MY JUDGE.
                  ENOUGH!!!
      YOU KEEP SENDING MY SISTER
      TO LONDON WITH MONEY
      TO SEDUCE ME,
              BUT YOU NEVER ONCE
              CAME YOURSELF!
          OH, I DIDN'T ALWAYS
          TAKE THE MONEY.
        AND SOMETIMES
        I THOUGHT I MIGHT FOLD
          AND RUN BACK LIKE
          SOME SCARED RABBIT.
                 BUT I HAVEN'T.
      AND I NEVER WILL..
AS LONG AS MOLL IS AT MY SIDE.
     IF PAIN....
  IS THE PROOF
  OF OUR DEVOTION...
  NOTHING HURTS ME MORE TODAY
THAN THE ANGUISH
WHICH YOU HAVE CAUSED
MY WIFE-TO-BE.
WITH THIS RING...
  I THEE WED.
      WHERE'S THAT WINE BOTTLE?
      WHERE'S THE WINE BOTTLE?!

  "HE FOUND ME IN THE MIRROR.
     "HE BECAME AS FERTILE
       IN HIS IMAGINATION
     AS I WAS IN MY BELLY."
     "WE EXPERIENCED
  A DELIRIOUS, TIMELESS PEACE.
IT'S MOVING.
                    KEEP STILL.
                    BOTH OF YOU.
        ( bell rings )
             IT'S A GIRL, MOLL.
             I KNOW IT'S A GIRL.
I'LL BE JEALOUS
IF YOU LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
      IF I CLOSE MY EYES, I HAVE
      ENOUGH LOVE FOR THE WORLD
AND YOU AT THE CENTER OF IT.
( chuckles )
YOU HAVEN'T A CANNY THOUGHT
IN YOUR HEAD, DO YOU?
                    FLORA.
                  I HAD A NANNY
                  BY THAT NAME.
         SHE OFTEN STOOD BETWEEN
         ME AND MY MOTHER.
                    FLORA.
            I THINK IT'S
            A BEAUTIFUL NAME.
"IF IN THE ACT
OF CREATING HUMANKIND
"GOD MIRRORED IN US HIS IMAGE,
"WE AND HE ARE THEREFORE
EQUAL IN THE STRUGGLE
FOR RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE--"
            WILL YOU SIT STILL?
I AM SITTING STILL.
    YOU'RE NOT SITTING STILL.
"WE AND HE SHOULD NOT BE
CONDEMNED FOR OUR FAILURES
NOR LOSE OUR WONDER
AT OUR SUCCESSES."
SO, STUDENT...
  WHAT DO YOU THINK?
         I THINK YOU REALLY DO
         HAVE AN EGG FOR A HEAD.
LET ME SEE THIS INSULT.
PLEASE.
                          NO.
  PLEASE.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
Moll: I'M NOT CLIMBING
THOSE STAIRS AGAIN.
IT'S YOUR TURN NEXT.
HOW'S IT GOING?
                    FINE.
  THAT'S PRETTY.
  WHAT IS THAT?
                  IT'S NOTHING.
                  IT'S NOTHING.
  YEAH.
Doctor:
I'LL SEND ONE OF
MY PEOPLE OVER.
WITH A CHILD IN YOU,
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.
    NOTHING WILL MAKE ME LEAVE.
      I ALREADY
      THREW HER OUT TWICE.
        I'LL FIND A WAY,
        NO MATTER WHAT THE COST.
  I'M SERVING HIM
  AS IF HE WERE MY BROTHER.
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF COST.
IT'S SMALLPOX.
             IF YOU'RE A DOCTOR,
             THEN CURE HIM!
HE'S TRYING HIS BEST, MOLL.
    HE'S DOING HIS BEST.
  "AND IF SHE CHANCE TO NOD,
      I'LL RAIL AND BRAWL
     "AND WITH THE CLAMOR
     KEEP HER STILL AWAKE.
 THIS IS A WAY TO KILL A WIFE
        WITH KINDNESS."
      YOU SEE? I COULD TEACH YOU
      A THING OR TWO.
YOU ALWAYS COULD.
KEEP READING TO ME, MOLL.
                I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
  ( shivering and muttering )
      THAT'S ENOUGH.
      YOU NEED TO GET YOUR REST.
 ( coughing )
    YOU'RE GONNA GET BETTER.
I WILL IF ONLY TO STOP YOU
GETTING MAD AT ME.
         IF I COULD PUT MY BLOOD
         IN YOUR BODY, I WOULD.
 I KNOW.
I KNOW.
            CLOSE YOUR EYES.
             CLOSE YOUR EYES.
         ( shivering )
         M-MOLL.
 WHAT?
          MY-MY BOOTS.
YOUR BOOTS?
          I WANT YOU TO
          PUT MY BOOTS ON.
YOUR BOOTS ON?
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
         I WANT YOU TO
        WEAR MY BOOTS.
                ( shivering
                and gasping )
ARE THEY DANCING BOOTS?
THESE YOUR DANCING BOOTS?
 YOU'RE SO SILLY.
     ALL RIGHT.
              THERE. YOU HAPPY?
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO WEAR THEM
FOR BOTH OF US.
                    OH, DON'T.
  AND FOR FLORA.
                        STOP.
     I-I-
  I K-KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
I FOUND MY CREATION IN YOU.
     IT'S LIFE.
    GOD IS LOVE, MOLL.
     LOVE IS GOD.
 ( crying )
 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
 GIVE ME YOUR HAND.
                  SO-SO BRIGHT.
      ( crying )
     WHY NOT ME?
 WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE ME?
            Hibble:
         "WHY NOT ME?
    WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE ME?"
I BET HE WOULDN'T HAVE
LET HER ABANDON ME,
IF HE'D LIVED.
                  WELL...
                  TIME TO SLEEP.
NO, DON'T STOP.
                 NO, IT'S TIME.
                    COME ON.
         FIVE POUNDS.
A DESECRATION.
        YOU COULD USE THE MONEY.
        IT COULD HELP OTHERS.
HE ALREADY DID.
  I HAVE HIS LETTER OF BEQUEST.
NO MAN WHO TOUCHES HIM
WILL LIVE TO GET OUT THAT DOOR.
             I'LL GIVE YOU TIME
             TO THINK THIS OVER.
      "I STAYED BESIDE HIM
         FOR TWO DAYS.
      "I FEARED IF I LEFT
      FOR A SINGLE MOMENT,
    " THEY WOULD TAKE HIM.
       I USED OUR SAVINGS
       TO MAKE HIM SAFE."

  WHY...THAT'S MY SERVANT GIRL.
        OUT OF MY WAY.
  I PAID FOR THEM CLOTHES.
  HOW DARE YOU GET THEM FILTHY?!
          I WAS JUST DRIVING BY.
          I DIDN'T HAVE YOU
          ON MY MIND.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

             LOVER BOY?
         DEAD.

        YOU ACCUSE ME.
          I HAVE A LAWYER

    FIFTY POUNDS
    WILL REPAIR THIS SLANDER.

     "BUT AT LEAST I COULD
      TRADE MY HUMILIATION
 FOR FOOD FOR MY CHILD."
         FOUND A FRIEND IN LIFE,
         OUR MRS. ALLWORTHY.
      THAT PIPE HAS DONE WONDERS
      FOR HER DISPOSITION.
      SHE USED TO BE MISERABLE.
NOW SHE'S BLEEDING INTOLERABLE.
    ( coughs and chuckles )
OH, WE MADE A PRETTY
LITTLE CONTRACT.
HAVEN'T WE, MOLL?
NOW THIS TIME,
YOU BETTER LIVE UP TO IT.
OH, RUB MY FEET.

NOW, BITCH.

OF COUPS,

WITH COMFORT,
BOUGHT A HOME

WANTED ME ABOUT AS FAR AWAY
FROM LONDON AS ONE CAN GET.

                 I'LL FETCH HER.
                     ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAVE YOU.
     ON STEPNEY LANE,
     WHERE YOU FOUND ME.
     SECOND FLOOR.
     SEE MRS. O'MALLEY.
                  MRS. O'MALLEY.
I'LL FIND HER.
                OY, BLACKIE,
GOT ANY NEWS FROM THE DEVIL?
                    OW! UGH.
        SENT YOU THAT.
      HOW'D YOU LIKE IT?
                        UGH.
  THERE WAS A--
  THERE WAS A FIRE
  ON STEPNEY LANE.
                 I'VE GOT TO GO!
NO. NO. NO!
THEY SAID THEY GOT
AS MANY OUT AS THEY COULD.
        BUT GOD HELP ME,
        I LOOKED.
        I COULDN'T FIND THEM.
  NO! NO!!!
          I'VE FAILED YOU, MOLL.

        HOLD HER.
    HOLD HER, HIBBLE.
IT'S HER BABY, MA'AM!
                 ONE LESS MOUTH.
     FOR GOD'S SAKE!

  LET ME GO!!!
    NOW GET HER ON THAT SHIP...

INHERIT THE EARTH.

 THERE'S ONLY
 A FEW MORE PAGES.
          WHAT DOES THIS WOMAN
          WANT OF ME?
NOTHING.

 WE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC,

    THE NAME OF MOLL FLANDERS
    WAS LOST FOREVER BENEATH
    THE WATERS OF THAT STORM.
        I LEARNED ABOUT
        THE COURAGE OF LIVING
        FROM YOUR MOTHER.
        BUT IT NEVER SET WELL
        IN MY BODY.
         IT WAS ON A BEACH
         VERY MUCH LIKE THAT ONE
            THAT I LEARNED
            THE TRUTH OF MYSELF,
  BECAUSE THE LORD SPARED
  ONLY ONE OTHER FROM THAT SHIP.
I THINK IT WAS TO TEST ME.
            NO MORE STORIES.
      NO MORE BLEEDIN' LESSONS!
    FLORA, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
    FLORA!
                FLORA, PLEASE!
                         FLORA!
                  FLORA!
        ( gasps )
I HATE YOU!
I HATE ALL OF YOU!
SHE'S STILL IN HERE!
MINE UNTIL I DIE!
  FLORA?
         FOR NINE YEARS, FLORA,
     I KINDLED A SPARK OF HOPE,
        THE TINIEST CANDLE FLAME
        KEEPING YOUR MOTHER
        FROM THE DARK.
     AS MRS. ALLWORTHY,
     SHE HAS EVERYTHING
     A PHYSICAL BODY COULD NEED.
              EXCEPT HER SOUL.
    NOW IT'S A MATTER OF TRUST.
             NOW YOU KNOW ENOUGH
             OF OUR DECEPTIONS
             TO HANG US BOTH.
              I WANTED YOU
              TO HEAR MY STORY.
            I WANTED NOTHING
            BUT THE TRUTH
            BETWEEN US.
            I NEVER KNEW
            MY OWN MOTHER.
            NEVER FELT HER,
            OR SMELLED HER HAIR.
      I SWORE THAT TERRIBLE FATE
      WOULD NOT BEFALL MY BABY.
             BUT I FAILED YOU.
              AND DESPITE MY...
            ...DEEPEST FEAR
     THAT MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
     MIGHT REJECT ME...
      WE HAVE ENOUGH TO SEND YOU
      ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
        THE CHOICE IS YOURS,
        FLORA.
             DO WITH THE TRUTH
             AS YOU WILL.
      OH, MOTHER.
        FINDING THIS WAS
        EASIER THAN FINDING YOU.
                THAT SEEMED LIKE
                A LIFETIME.
              IT'S YOUR FATHER,
     FLORA.
  I LOVE HIS SPIRIT
  YOU CARRY IN YOU.
 "WE DANCED LIKE SPARROWS
 AROUND THE FLAME OF EACH OTHER,
   "FLUTTERING AND GLIDING ON
 THE CURRENTS OF OUR EMOTIONS.
         "WE CELEBRATED
       IN THE GREAT TRUTH
      "THAT I HAD LEARNED
     FROM HER FATHER:
       "ALL MEN AND WOMEN
       ARE CREATED EQUAL.
      "WE ARE ONE BEING...
          HUMANKIND."

     ¶ THE WINTER WAS COLD
         AND BITTER ¶
 ¶ IT CHILLED ME TO THE BONE
    ¶ I HADN'T SEEN THE SUN
          FOR WEEKS ¶
          ¶ TOO LONG,
      TOO FAR FROM HOME ¶
 ¶ I FELT LIKE I WAS SINKING
        ¶ AND I CLAWED
      FOR SOLID GROUND ¶
      ¶ I WAS PULLED DOWN
    BY THE UNDERTOW ¶
      ¶ I NEVER THOUGHT I
     COULD FEEL SO ALONE ¶
        ¶ OH, DARKNESS,
I FELT LIKE LETTING GO ¶
    ¶ ALL OUT OF STRENGTH,
     ALL OUT OF COURAGE ¶
      ¶ COME AND LIFT ME
    FROM THIS PLACE ¶
    ¶ I KNOW I CAN LOVE YOU
    MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ¶
    ¶ FULL OF GRACE,
        FULL OF GRACE ¶
          ¶ MY LOVE
¶ IT'S BETTER THIS WAY
          ¶ I SAID
        ¶ HAVEN'T SEEN
      THIS PLACE BEFORE ¶
      ¶ WHERE EVERYTHING
    WE SAID AND DID ¶
¶ HURT US ALL THE MORE
      ¶ IT'S JUST THAT WE
    STAYED TOO LONG ¶
¶ IN THE SAME OLD SICKLY SKIN
      ¶ I WAS PULLED DOWN
    BY THE UNDERTOW ¶
      ¶ I NEVER THOUGHT I
     COULD FEEL SO ALONE ¶
        ¶ OH, DARKNESS,
I FELT LIKE LETTING GO ¶
  ¶ ALL OUT OF THE STRENGTH,
ALL OUT OF THE COURAGE ¶
      ¶ COME AND LIFT ME
    FROM THIS PLACE ¶
    ¶ I KNOW I CAN LOVE YOU
    MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ¶
    ¶ FULL OF GRACE
    ¶ I KNOW I CAN LOVE YOU
    MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ¶
¶ IT'S BETTER THIS WAY
