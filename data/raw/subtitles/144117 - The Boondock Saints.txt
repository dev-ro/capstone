Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
on earth
as it is in heaven.
Give us this day
our daily bread,
and forgive us
our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us
not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power...
and the glory
now and forever.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Thank you, Father Macklepenny,
for coming all the way
across town to be our guest speaker.
When I raise my flashing sword...
and my hand
takes hold on judgment,
I will take vengeance
up on mine enemies.
And I will repay those
who haze me.
O Lord, raise me
to Thy right hand...
and count me
among Thy saints.
And I am reminded
on this holy day...
of the sad story
of Kitty Genovese.
As you all may remember,
a long time ago,
almost 30 years ago,
this poor soul
cried out for help...
time and time again,
but no person
answer her calls.
Though many saw,
no one so much
as called the police.
They all just watched as Kitty
was being stabbed to death...
in broad daylight.
They watched as
her assailant walked away.
Now, we must all fear
evil men.
But there is
another kind of evil...
which we must fear most,
and that is
the indifference...
of good men!
I do believe the monsignor's
finally got the point.
Aye.
Hey, Connor!
What?
Yeah!
Who's the master?
You're gonna be
training her today.
Aye.
- Basically, the rule of thumb here is--
- Wait. Rule of thumb?
In the early 1900s, it was legal
for men to beat their wives...
as long as they used a stick
no wider than their thumb.
Can't do much damage
with that then, can we?
Perhaps it should've been
the ""rule of wrist.''
I knew you two pricks
would give me problems.
Come on. It's St. Patty's Day.
It's all in good fun.
Ah, fuck you!
And fuck you too!
We're sorry, all right?
Just-Just relax.
Oh, shit.
Hey, fuck-ass,
give me a beer.
Listen, boys, I've got
some very bad news.
I'm gonna have to
close down t-t-the bar.
The Russians are buying up buildings
all over the town, includin' this one.
Fuck! Ass!
And they're not lettin' me
renew my lease.
- Let me talk to my boss.
- Maybe he can do something.
- What the fuck's your boss gonna do?
Listen, fellas,
I don't want anyone to know.
Soyou keep your traps shut!
You know what they say:
People in glass houses sink s-s-ships.
Hey, Doc, I gotta buy you,
like, a proverb book or somethin'.
This mix-and-match shit
has gotta go.
- What?
A penny saved is worth
two in the bush, isn't it?
And don't cross the road
ifyou can't get out ofthe kitchen.
What's this, then?
I am Ivan Checkov,
and you will be closing now.
Checkov.
Well, this here's McCoy.
We find a Spock,
we've got us an away team.
Me in no mood for discussion.
You, you stay.
The rest of you,
go now.
Why don't you make like a tree
and get the fuck out of here!
You know he's got
till the week's end, right?
You don't have to be
hard-asses, doya?
- It's St. Patty's Day.
Everyone's Irish tonight.
- Mmm.
Why don't you just
pull up a stool
and have a drink with us?
- This is no game! If you won't go,
we will make you go.
So these two guys are kickin'
the shit out of each other, right?
This guy picks up
an old kitchen sink or something...
and fuckin' crushes
this guy with it.
It makes a big bang.
Look at him. His spine's all crushed.
Had to be one big motherfucker.
Huge. Three, four hundred pounds.
Fuckin' huge.
- That's pretty thin.
- Very thin.
Okay.
Allright, allright.
Say these two guys right here,
they don't even know
the fuckin' huge guy.
They're just staggering home
from a bar still all fucked up
from St. Patty's last night.
They decide to take a shortcut
down through the alley.
Wrong fuckin' alley, huh?
'Cause this big motherfucker,
he's just waitin' for 'em, right?
And what could be more perfect
for a strong-arm robbery?
Two drunk guys all bandaged up.
They're already injured,
for Christ's sakes. Lookat 'em.
These guys are stumblin'
through the alley.
 Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-la
This guy takes a blunt object,
fuckin'-- Waah!
Hits the guy with the bandages
around his head, right?
Why? 'Cause he's smart.
He knows the guy with
the band age around his ass,
he ain't goin' nowhere.
He's goin' fuckin' nowhere!
Where are you goin'?
Nowhere! That's right.
He ain't done yet.
He comes over and jumps
on this guy's back...
and crushes him to death.
I feel something big here.
I wouldn't be surprised to see
a lot of these turnin' up.
Brilliant!
So now we got
a huge guy theory...
and a serial crusher theory.
Top notch.
- What's your name?
- Detective Greenly.
- Who the fuck are you?
- That's who the fuck I am.
Listen, I gotta do this
by the numbers.
I.D. just came back
on these guys.
They got connections
with the Russian mob.
That makes it
a federal matter.
And Agent Smecker here
is heading up the investigation
with our full cooperation.
- Why don'tyou get me a cup of coffee?
- Who the hell is this?
- A cafe latte, twist of lemon,
- What the fuck--
- Chief, what the fuck is this?
- Sweet 'N Low.
- Mitchell, Langley!
- Yes, sir.
- Find the manager of this building.
See if he's had any complaints
of water coming down...
in any of the apartments
starting just this morning.
Langley, you take that building.
Same thing.
Chaffey! Newman!
- Yes, sir.
- Look in the trash around their hands.
See if you can fnd me
two bullet casings,
fifty-caliber
if my eyes serve me right.
Newman,
rip through this shit.
If this was a sink,
find me some metal parts.
Give me a drain cover,
faucet or something.
Got it right here.
It's a 50-cal.
Chief, can you get
ballistics down here...
and tell 'em they have to dig
a 50-caliber slug...
out of a brickwall
and locate another that's been
fred through a Dumpster?
We have the best
ballistics guy in the world.
- I can have him here in ten minutes.
- How did you know that?
Liquid paraffn.
Came up positive.
And bullet holes
are usually a big clue.
Nobody reported
any gunshots.
This is an Irish neighborhood.
I'm surprised you even got a phone call.
You know, I can't find
these condone, sir.
Look under the body.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
You guys ready for this?
This was no
gangland assassination.
Though creative,
it was way too sloppy.
Something went wrong here.
This has ""personal'' written all over it.
Agent Smecker.
Yeah, this is all illegal loft housing.
There's no manager on
the premises, but they found
a lady on the fourth floor...
who said she had water dripping
down on her whole place.
- It started just this morning.
- Fourth floor, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Then we're headin'
to the fifth.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
You're reachin; man.
- It's a theory.
- I don't know. No way.
You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.
Oh, really? I might just be
wantin' a bagel with my coffee.
I ain't gettin' him
no fuckin' bagel.
We'll start the ass kissing
with you.
Agent Smecker.
Agent--
Listen, I know this neighborhood
pretty good.
There's a bar down the block
named McGinty's.
- It stands a good chance
they were there last night.
- Good work, Mitchell.
I'll check it out myself.
Lookat the ceiling.
Sensey our touch alone.
Wait until you feel me move.
Ooh.
So quick you couldn't
even feel it go, could you?
Let's try it again.
Try it again. Look at the ceiling.
It's Doc.
- Thanks for comin', Doc.
- Jesus Christ!
What the fuck happened?
Are-Are you b-b-boys all right?
- We're alive.
- An F.B.I. agent came by the bar...
and he left me
his c-c-ca--
He left me his c-c--
Oh, he fuckin' gave me this.
Fuck!
- Ass! What are you gonna do?
We oughta turn ourselves in,
tell him it was self-defense.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what he said.
- How the fuck's he know that?
We haven't spoken to anyone.
- D-D-Don't know.
He d-d-didn't say.
All right. Listen, Doc,
we need you to do us a favor.
- A-A-Anything.
-Just hold on to this for us.
- We're gonna come back for it
when we get out.
- Right.
Fuck! Ass!
None of that cursing
was directed at you.
He's-- He's a bit--
First of all,
I'd like to thank
which ever one of you...
doughnut-munching,
barrel-assed,
pud-pulling sissies
leaked this to the press.
That's just
what we need now--
some sensational story
in the papers...
making these boys out to be
superheroes triumphing over evil.
Let me squash
the rumors now.
These two are not heroes.
They're just
two ordinary men...
who were put in
an extraordinary situation,
and they just happened
to come out on top.
Yes, nothing from our
far-reaching computer system...
has turned up diddly
on these two.
All we know is what
we found out from the neighbors.
And the general consensus is,
they're angels.
But angels don't kill.
And we got
two bodies in the morgue...
that look like they've been
serial-crushed...
by some huge, friggin' guy.
Are we considering these guys
armed and dangerous?
Well, not armed.
If they had guns,
they would've used them.
But dangerous? Very.
Now, what makes you think
they're dangerous?
- Maybe they're just
protectin' each other.
Hey, look, I-I-I'm not sayin'
one way or the other.
Just be careful and go
by the protocol on this.
It's grunt police work
that's gonna bring this one in.
These guys are
miles away by now.
But if you wanna beat your head
against the wall, then
here's what you're lookin'for.
They're scared, like
two little bunny rabbits.
Anything in a uniform
or flashing blue lights
is gonna spook 'em.
Okay? So the only thing we can do
is put a potato on a string...
and drag it through
South Boston.
- Thanks for comin' out.
You'd probably have
better luckwith a beer.
You would.
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey, Greenly.
Onion bagel, cream cheese.
This conversation
is going to be recorded.
Just answer to
the best of your knowledge.
Excuse me, sir.
Please.
Okay, we're ready.
You boys are not under oath here.
Just answer the questions.
I'm assuming...
you knew these guys
from before, huh?
We met them last night.
They had some
pretty interesting bandages.
Know anything about that?
Listen, if you want to fght,
you can see you're out numbered here.
We're trying to be civil,
so I suggest you take our offer.
I make the offers.
Hey, Boris.
What would you do...
if I told you...
-your pinko Commie mother
sucks so much dick,
her face looks like an egg?
- Fuck you!
- What are you doin'?
Stay away!
He can take care of himself!.
Freeze,
you fuckin' Irish faggots!
Get the fuck up!
- Come on!
- Get your fuckin' hands off of me!
Cuff yourself around the back!
Cuff yourself!.
Cuff it!
You know why
I fucking come here?
I come here to kill you.
But now, I no think
I fucking kill you.
I kill your brother.
Shoot him in the head.
- Fuck you!
- Gotta go.
Connor!
It was just a fuckin' bar fight!
You guys are fuckin' pussies!
I hope your conscience
is clear, Irishman.
So, how is it...
- that you guys are fluent in Russian?
- We paid attention in school.
Do you speak
any other languages?
- Aye. Our mother insisted on it.
- French?
Oh, that's beautiful.
- What's that?
- It's Italian.
- Jawohl.
What are you guys doin' workin'
at a friggin' meat packing plant?
- Uh, Agent Smecker?
The press is everywhere.
- Yeah.
They're just goin' nuts for these guys.
I don't know what you wanna do.
You're not being charged.
It's up to you. You wanna talk to 'em?
- Absolutely not.
- No pictures either.
Is there anyway
that we could stay here?
Uh, yeah. You know,
we have an extra holding cell
you guys can--
- Can they stay?
- Well, we'll have
to check with your mom.
But it's okay with me
if your friends sleep over.
Time to feed the dogs.
Okay, people.
Okay.
This is our
offcial statement.
The MacManus brothers
are not being charged
with a crime.
This is a clear-cut case
of self-defense.
They are being released
at an undisclosed
time and location...
in accordance with
their wishes.
- Do the MacManus brothers
have any priors?
- Can we speak to the brothers?
- Hey, Rocco, how you doin'?
- Hey!
Yeah!
What have you got there?
- Ahh.
- Very nice.
This poor soul...
cried out for help.
They watched as
he simply walked away.
Indifference of good men!
Nobody wanted to get involved.
Nobody
- Who so ever shed my blood,
by man shall his blood
be shed.
For in the image of God
may deem a man.
Destroy all that
which is evil.
So that which is good
may flourish.
What the fuck is that?
It's that fuckin'
Russian's pager.
Let's go.
How are ya?
- Keep the faith, man.
- Fuckin' blow me.
- What was that?
Have you got a pen?
- Yeah. Here you go.
- Thanks. Be right back.
- Good morning, son. How are ya?
- Good morning.
- We'd be honored if you would join us.
- See this?
- What's this?
Saints?
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.
Amen.
That's not funny, man.
Give it here, package boy.
Joey Beevo said it was important.
Said to give it to him myself.
Give me the fuckin' thing.
Sit the fuck down.
So, I'm Rocco.
I'm the funny man.
I'm so fuckin' funny.
- Fuck you, Vincenzo.
- Uh-huh.
How did you get
that shiner on your eye?
What's the matter, someone
didn't think you were very funny?
I caught your show at
the Velvet Room at the Holiday Inn.
Loved it when you busted into
""Viva Las Vegas.''
- Hey, hey, hey
You insignifcant little fuck!
I always get my money,
you cock sucking bastardo!
The '90s are killing me.
I shouldn't have done that.
You're not supposed to tell a guy
you're gonna kill him no more.
I gotta tip to through the tulips
with these assholes.
Taking all the fun
out of the job.
Pappa Joe,
you want me to go now?
All the boys tell me
how you make them laugh
when you come around.
What a crack up you are.
What do they call you?
Uh, the--
The-The funny man.
The funny man.
I'm having a shitty day.
I'm depressed.
Tell me a funny joke.
Now?
A joke? Uh--
Um, uh, a joke.
Yeah, allright.
Um, there's these, uh,
three guys--
a-a-a spic,
a-a-a white guy
and a black guy.
- Nigger!
- Yeah.
N-N-- Yeah.
And they're walkin'
along the beach.
They see this pot.
They rub it,
a genie comes out.
Genie says you can wish for
anything you want. He asks
the Mexican what he wants.
And he goes,
""I want all my people in America
to be happy and free in Mexico.''
So the genie-- Poof!.
And all the spics
are in Mexico.
- And then he asks the black guy--
- Nigger.
Yeah, that's what I said.
He goes to the nigger,
says, ""What do you want?''
And he goes,
""I want all my African--
""my nigger brothers
in America...
to be back in Africa
and happy and everything.''
So the genie goes poof!.
And, um, all the niggers
in America...
are in Africa.
And this is goin'--
I'm not funny today.
I know. I'm havin' a hard day.
I-I-- This joke sucks.
It's just a stupid joke.
Continue the joke.
So the genie
says to the white guy,
""What's your one wish?''
And the white guy goes,
""You mean to tell me...
all the niggers and spics
are out of America?''
The genie goes, ""Yeah.''
He says,
"" Well, um,
I'll have a Coke then.''
"I'll have a Coke..."
Yeah.
Everybody's out,
so he just wants a Coke,
'cause that's all he needs.
- Tell me one more.
- What?
Knock your selves out.
Fuckin' hell.
- Do you know what
we need, man? Some rope.
- Absolutely.
- What are ya, insane?
- No, it ain't.
Charlie Bronson's
always got rope.
- What?
- Yeah.
He's got a lot of rope strapped
around him in the movies,
and they always end up using it.
- You've lost it, haven't it?
- No, I'm serious.
That's stupid. Name one thing
you'd need a rope for.
You don't fuckin' know
what you're gonna need it for.
They just always need it.
What's this ""they'' shit ?
This isn't a movie.
Oh. Right.
Is that right, Rambo?
All right.
Get your stupid fuckin' rope.
I'll get my stupid rope.
I'll get it.
There's rope right there.
You nervous?
- A bit.
- Myself as well.
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Room number?
Have we got
a time of death?
- We got a body count?
- Uh-huh. I'll be down there in a bit.
Keep the press out.
- What are you doin'?
- I just wanted to cuddle.
Cuddle?
What a fag.
Ooh.
This is a fucking
slaughter house.
- How many bodies, Greenly?
- Eight.
Aw, shit.
I forgot about that one.
Nine. Nine?
While Greenly's out gettin' coffee,
any body else want anything?
Shit!
So, Duffy,
you got any theories
to go with that tie?
Look, fuck all
these other guys.
This was their target--
the fag man.
The what man?
The fat man.
Well, Freud was right.
So you think they came
for the fag man, huh?
What do you base this about
He was the only one done right.
Double tap back of the head.
- And the pennies?
- New hit man wants to leave his mark.
That's a possibility.
Now you Irish cops
are perkin'up.
That's two sound theories
in one day,
neither of which deal
with abnormally-sized men.
Kind of makes me feel
like River dancing.
An other possibility is
they were placed there
with religious intent.
Okay, some cultures still
put pennies in the eyes
of the dead. Or silver.
The Italians, the Greeks.
Sicilians.
So, what's
the ""symbology'' there?
The ""symbology''?
Now that Duffy has relinquished
his King Bonehead crown,
I see we have an heir
to the thrown.
I'm sure the word you were
looking forwas ""symbolism.''
What is the symbolism there.
Let me explain it toyou.
In Greek and Roman mythology,
when you died, you'd have
to pay the toll to Charon,
the boatman who ferried you
across to the Gates of Judgment.
This made sure the dead
came to at one for what they did
during their lives,
Detective Alapopskalius.
Jesus. You're the frst one
that ever got that.
Yeah, well, I'm an expert
in nameology.
These burns indicate
that they used silencers.
Look at these
entry and exit wounds.
They're almost identical.
The two bullets went in here
through the top of the skull,
crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.
This one clue tells us
three distinct facts.
- Number one. Duffy?
- They shot him at a downward angle.
- They put him on his knees?
- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.
They shot him
at a downward angle?
It tells us
he was the last to die.
And number three.
Dolly.
There was two shooters.
- Fan-freakin'-tastic.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Stay with me, boys.
What did they do...
to make two such
identical wounds?
Two men of similar height
dropped this guy down.
Each puts some iron
to his head and boom!
That's all she frickin' wrote.
- What about one guy, two guns?
- Ah, possible.
But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.
A guy holding two guns
to the back of your noodle is
going to shoot straight ahead.
He wouldn't cock out his elbows.
It makes no sense.
Besides, are you telling me
one guy came in here...
and killed eight men with eight
extremely well-aimed shots
in just a few seconds?
No way.
It had to be at least two.
You and your fuckin' rope.
- I told you there would be a shaft.
-Just like on television.
Fuck.
Where the fuck
are you goin'?
Shh! I fuckin' hear
some shit out here.
Fuck you.
I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin'
your fuckin' rope around.
- It must weigh 30 pounds.
- Shh!
We are doin' some serious
shit here. Now, get
a fuckin' hold of yourself!.
Oh, fuck you!
I'm not the rope-totin'
Charlie Bronson wannabe...
- that's gettin' us fuckin' lost.
- Would you fuckin' shut it!
You mother--
-Jesus fuckin' Christ.
- Oh, shit!
Shepherds we shall be
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.
Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand.
Our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.
So we shall flow a river forth
to Thee, and teeming
with souls shall it ever be.
And I shall count thee
among my favored sheep.
And you shall have the protection
of all the angels in heaven.
Television.
Television is
the explanation for this.
You see this in bad television.
The little assault guys
creepin' through the vents,
comin' in through the ceiling.
Tha tJames Bond shit
never happens in real life.
Professionals don't do that.
Well, name one thing
you're gonna need
this stupid fuckin' rope for.
- That was way easier than I thought.
- Aye.
On TV,
you've always got that guy
that jumps over the sofa.
- And then you've gotta shoot him
for ten fuckin' minutes too.
- Aye.
- We're good.
- Yes, we are.
Now, what doyou think
is in that little case there?
- Fuck me!
- Oh.
The hits just keep on comin'.
Ow!
Give it a smell.
- I love our new job.
Bastard.
This has got to be
his big break.
-Yeah.
- We've got to fuck with him, right?
- Okay.
Shh.
Open the door.
I'm gonna grab him
by the fuckin' hair.
- Sit down!
- Get down! Shut up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- We're on the same side.
Please, don't shoot.
- Get on the ground!
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
We're on the same side.
Boss must've sent me
in as backup. I'm Rocco!
- I'm the funny man.
That ain't my name.
- Where's your gun?
- Where's your gun?
- I'm the fuckin' funny man!
It's right here. Right here.
That ain't my real name.
What the fuck?
Jeez!
It's a fuckin' six-shooter!
- There's nine bodies, genius!
What the fuck were you gonna do,
laugh the last three to death,
funny man?
Pappa Joe said
there was only two!
In and out!
Boy, you guys
sure did a good job.
Ah, shit.
You guys are good, huh?
Cool masks.
Where'd you get 'em?
- We gotta do him right here!
- Right now!
- Don't, please! I'm the funny man!
- Right.
- Don't kill me!
Don't kill me, please!
- Right!
I'm the funny man!
What a fuckin' idiot!
Fuckin'--
What the fuckin' fuck--
Who the fuck--
Fuck this fuckin'--
How did you two
fuckin' fucks-- Fuck!
Well, that certainly illustrates
the diversity of the word.
All these guys
are Russian mob.
But not like those two peons
in the alley the other day.
These guys are all syndicate
bosses and underbosses.
I have a dossier
on every man in this room.
Since the Iron Curtain
has gone down,
the Russian syndicates
have started to come here.
And in the spirit of Glasnost,
the Soviets have opened
their borders to the Mafia.
But the Italians,
they aren't convinced...
the grounds in Mother Russia
are fertile enough
for organized crime yet.
So they ain't ready to commit.
But the Russians
are coming here anyway.
They are unwelcome.
So, what we have here,
gentlemen,
is possibly the beginning...
of the frst
international mob war.
Unless I've
totally missed something.
I'm live from
the Copley Plaza Hotel,
where we have just been informed
that the largest multiple murder...
in Boston's history
has just taken place.
We have learned that
there were nine victims,
all deeply involved in a notoriously
violent Russian crime syndicate,
right here in Boston.
Any body you think is evil?
Aye.
Don't you think
that's a little weird, a little psycho?
Do you know what I think
is psycho, Roc?
It's decent men
with loving families.
They go home
every day after work,
and they turn on the news.
You know what they see?
They see rapists...
and murderers
and child molesters.
They're all gettin'
out of prison.
Mafiosos...
gettin' caught
with 20 kilos...
gettin' out on bail
the same fuckin' day.
And everywhere,
everyone thinks the same thing--
that someone should just
go kill those motherfuckers.
Kill 'em all.
Admit it.
Even you've thought about it.
You guys should be
in every major city.
This is some heavy shit.
This is like
""Lone Ranger'' heavy, man.
Fuck it!
There's so much shit
that pisses me off!.
You guys should recruit, 'cause
I'm sick and fuckin' tired...
of walkin' down the street
wait in' for one of these crack-pipin',
ass-wipin', motherless
low lifes to get me!
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
So you're not just talkin'
about mob guys, right?
You're talkin' about pimps
and drug dealers
and all that shit, right?
Oh, yeah.
Fuck. You guys could
do this every goddamn day.
We're sort of like 7-Eleven.
We're not always doin' business,
but we're always open.
- Mmm. That is nicely put.
- Thank you very much.
I will fuck you up, dude.
So then we go right through
the fuckin' ceiling like this--
Oh, boy.
You fuckin' guys.
You ruined me.
I'm fuckin' done.
Permanent fuckin' package boy.
Who said that?
You can take credit
on that, you know?
What, are you serious?
Yeah. Fuck it.
If you think about it,
it's all you can do, really.
I mean,
you can't goin there
and tell him it was us.
Climb the corporate
ladder, boy.
Don Rocco.
Fuck it.
I'm doin' it.
I deserve it.
I've been workin'
for those fat bastards
since I've been in high school.
Look at this fuckin' place.
They're fuckin' me, man.
They can suck
my pathetic little dick!
And I'll dip my nuts
in marinara sauce...
just so the fat bastards
can get a taste of home
while they're at it.
Fuck it!
I'm doin'it.
It is done!
Shit!
- Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck!
- I'm hit!
Oh, fuck!
What the fuck!
I can't believe
that just fuckin' happened!
- Is it dead?
- Oh, my God!
Donna's gonna be angry
about her cat.
Shit.
She's on every drug
known to man.
She'd have sold the thing
for a dime bag. Screw her.
I do kind of feel
like an asshole, though.
Yeah, Roc, you sound
real remorseful there.
She ain't been around
in weeks anyhow.
Listen, something's been
botherin' me about last night.
What?
What if your boss knew
how many fellows
were supposed to be there?
- What are you--
What areyou sayin'?
- Think about it.
Nine men, six bullets.
Think they sold me out?
No way. No way.
Listen, he probably knew
you'd end up nailin' the fat guy,
maybe one or two more,
but he had to know you
weren't walkin' out of there.
Figure it out.
The shooter's dead at the scene.
There's no
in-depth investigation.
They'll just slide right off
his fuckin' back.
'Cause what the fuck?
As much as I love you, man,
you are not exactly Don Corleone.
No, no, that--
That's just not the way
things are done.
Besides, how does he know...
I just don't get in there,
see there's too many of'em,
serve 'em their fuckin' food--
Because he fuckin'
knows you, Roc!
A smooth hitter would have
gone in there, seen it was
a fuckin' wash and slipped out.
But you, he knows
this is your only shot.
You've been waitin'
18 fuckin' years.
No. No, no.
That-That--
That just ain't the way--
No, that's bull-- That's bullshit.
You don't know what
you're talkin' about. That's
just not the way things happen.
I mean, thanks for your concern and all,
but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor, all right?
Just roll it around a bit
on your way in.
- Will you for me?
- No. No rollin'.
Nothin' needs to be rolled.
Fuck!
- Where the fuck are you goin'?
Did you tell him?
- Of course I fuckin' told him.
- Then what the fuck?
- You guys don't know
that shit for sure!
Oh, you're such
a fuckin' retard!
- Hey, fuck you!
- Oh, man, use your
fuckin' brain for once!
Is it so unbelievable that
they don't fuckin' care about ya?
Oh, yeah, you two fuckin' Micks
know what's goin' on, huh?
- Fuckyouboth!
- This is not a fuckin' thing you
should gamble on, all right?
I'm the fuck out ofhere.
Fine! Fuck it!
What kind of flowers you want
at your funeral, you dumb wop?
- It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
- I'll be back at nine!
- Bury the fuckin' cat!
- Listen, you get in there...
and you start gettin' a bad vibe,
you get the fuck out quick!
- Hello?
- Murph.
- Hey, Roc. You okay?
Anybody call for me?
No, man.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fne.
I'll catch you
on the flip side.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Pack your shit! Pack your shit!
We gotta get out of here!
- We gotta get out!
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
I killed them!
Oh,Jesus, I killed them all!
- Just calm down.
Tell us what happened.
- No!
- Rocco!
- Calm down, man.
Fuck you!
You start gettin' excited,
motherfucker!
- We gotta go!
- Rocco!
- Well, how many were there?
- Fuckin' hurry the fuck up!
All right!
I love this shit!
- What the fuck is wrong withyou, Roc?
- The cocksucker sold me out!
Didn't I tell you, Roc?
Did they pull on you frst?
What am I doin'?
I'm in it at Lakeview!
Lakeview the deli, Roc?
- Looks like we got us
a new fuckin' recruit.
- Rocco!
- What?
- Where's my cat?
I killed your cat,
you druggie bitch.
- God. Why?
- What?
I felt it would bring
closure to our relationship.
- You killed my-my--
- Your what?
- My--
- Your fuckin' what? Huh?
Your what, bitch?
I'll shoot myself
in the head...
if you can tell me
that cat's name!
Go ahead! Your what?
Your precious little--
- Skippy. Skippy.
- Oh, Jesus.
What color was it, bitch?
Don't you fuckin'
yell at her like that,
you prick!
Shut your fat ass, Rayvie!
I can't buy a pack of smokes
without runnin' into
nine guys you fucked!
- Damn! Son of a bitch.
Let's go!
Let's get the fuck
outta here!
Those rat fucks! All of them
were all laughin' at me, man.
- Are you sure you killed them, Roc?
- Fuckin'-A right I did.
I had a goddamn
turkey shoot over there.
- Anybody call for me?
- No, man.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fne.
I'll catch you
on the flip side.
I know there's something
happening here
I know there's something
happening here
Do my eyes deceive my mind
I'll bet it was
a fuckin' test.
Vincenzo came in here
shootin' his mouth off.
He made sure we knew.
But we did what
we were supposed to, huh?
We kept our mouths shut.
You?
You did your part.
Fuck!
They know we're good fellas now.
We'll get taken care of, baby.
What? Did everyone know?
Next thing you're gonna tell me
Sal was in on it.
Vincenzo told Sal frst.
That fat fuck knew
before we did.
At least we got
our funny man back, huh?
Here's some more
that you fear
- That was funny, wasn't it?
That was real fucking funny!
- No, not me! Not me!
Huh? Ha! Funny! Funny!
- Funny! Funny! Funny!
- Funny!
- Full, full
Full, full
Full, full
- Full
- Listen, Roc, did anybody seeya?
Fuck, man, I might as well
have gone around postin' flyers.
Right out in public, man.
Liberating, isn't it?
- Let's fucking go!
- You know, it is a bit.
Conner, stop the car!
Stop the fucking car, man!
Vincenzo,
that fat motherfucker,
Yakavetta's right hand!
He's the one who set me up,
then he went around telling
everybody I was as good as dead.
Goes there every Wednesday night
10:00, jerks off on the same
titty dancer. Never misses.
- Yeah, so?
- So? So let's kill
the motherfucker!
I mean, what are you guys?
That's your new thing, right?
- Yeah, well--
- Ah, what the fuck!
I mean, who makes the cut?
Is there a raffle or something?
To tell you the truth,
those first ones, they just sort
of fell on to our laps.
Well, what do you do?
We haven't really got a system
of decidin' who, Roc. It's--
Me! Me! I'm the guy!
I know everyone, their habits,
who they hang out with,
who they talk to!
I got phone numbers, addresses!
I know who they're fuckin'!
I know where they live!
We could kill everyone.
So what do you think?
I'm strangely comfortable
with it.
That's him.
- Okay, Roc.
What? You guys got masks.
You look like Mush Mouth
from Fat Albert.
Fine. Fuck it!
When we're done,
she can I.D. me.
I don't care. Just trying
to be professional, but no!
- It looks fne.
- No, fuck it.
No, shut the fuck up!
You look good. Put it on.
You look fucking scary, man.
Now, Roc, are you sure
that you're ""O-B-kay-B''?
 
She was in here
when it all went down.
- Can she I.D. 'em?
- No.
- There were wearin' masks.
- Of course they were.
You scream, you're dead!
Which one's he in?
And don't make like
you don't know who the fuck
I'm talkin' about!
- Don't you talk to me like that,
you dirty little girl.
Oh, yeah. Give it to Daddy.
Oh, this is one
sick motherfucker.
- How many?
- Three.
Two of them did the shootin'.

"...and teeming with souls
shall it ever be. ''
Our little theory from last night
just got shot to shit.
Something new is going on here.
After talking to the dancer,
we know their mark
was the guy in the middle booth.
After she watches 'em whack him,
she passes out.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'll tip her!
Why are there two
extra victims?
- Witnesses.
- No way they could have seen.
Allow me
to enlighten you gentlemen...
to the protocol
of the porno industry,
as I'm sure you've never been
in one of these places before.
A man goes into the booth,
puts the money through the slot,
the dancer gets it
on the other side.
She hits the button,
the door goes up.
Now there's only
glass between you, and
that's ""little freman'' time.
No way they could have seen it.
Those doors were down,
so that means this:
They looked in,
down through the peep holes,
saw these guys, opened the doors
from the inside,
pop, pop, pop,
right through the glass.
Why?
- It's like a scumbag yard sale.
- We should come down here
once a week and clean house.
Maybe the three guys
had something in common.
No, this guy's big-time.
These two are street-walkin' scum.
Then that's what they had in
common-- they're all bad guys.
Now they're all dead bad guys.
Oh, man, you gotta
let me do these guys.
I'm such a moron.
I gotta make up
for that tit thing.
- There's no way. I've been
waitin' for this asshole.
- Oh, come on.
Come on, man.
Give the guy his shot.
It's the real deal, Roc.
Evil men, dead men.
Good shooting...
shitty shooting.
Plus... we got us a genuine...
Kennedy assassination-style
bullet theory here.
Two guns were used.
The guy in the middle...
was done with both of'em.
Now this guy, he was killed...
with bullets
from gun ""A'' only...
and this guy, gun ""B'' only.
But ballistics dug two slugs
out ofthe wall from ""B''...
over here where the victim
was done with ""A.''
Andit's the same thing over here.
Why the crossover?
That's just fuckin' weird.
I have no idea.
Jesus, I just can't think
any more.
That scene over at the coffee
shop today just tapped me out.
What scene?
Some guy went nuts
over of the Com Ave.
Shot three guys to death in
a coffee shop, broad daylight,
fled the scene.
- Don't have much on him.
- Why wasn't I informed of this?
They weren't related.
The guy used a .38.
- No pennies, totally amateur.
- Who were the victims?
- A couple of mob peons
and a fat fuck bartender.
- Oh, isn't that beautiful?
All the low lifes in quiet city
Boston start droppin' dead,
and you think it's unrelated!
Greenly, the day I want
the Boston Police to do
my thinkin' for me,
I will have a fucking tag
on my toe!
Now get me a squad car
and get me over there!
I want crime scene photos
and any witness statements now!
Wyatt fuckin' Earp!
It looks like we got us
a cowboy. Hmm.
"So we shall flow a river forth
to Thee...
and teeming with souls
shall it ever be. ''
Hey, hey, man.
You guys gotta teach me
that prayer.
- That's some good shit, man.
- Cool it, Roc. It's a family prayer.
- My father's father before him.
So that's our shit.
- Oh, come on!
The victims were found...
at a local
adult entertainment parlor.
These murders,
coupled with the three suspected
mob-related killings...
that occurred
at this local Boston deli
earlier this afternoon,
brings the death toll to six,
just today.
There is no doubt that all
the victims have been criminals.
Perhaps this explains
why a public outcry...
to have these crimes stopped
has not been heard.
Ah, these two crime scenes
are related.
Too many coincidences.
Same day, fivehours apart,
dead mobsters in both scenes.
Now...
why did he kill the bartender?
Crime of passion.
Just went nuts.
He shot everyone in here.
- Just ran out of bullets.
- Does this look like a friggin'
post office to you?
This guy came in here
with intent.
Maybe he didn't know
exactly what he was gonna do,
but he had a good idea.
No, the bar tender
was no fuckin' accident.
Well, we didn't need
any help on that.
A lot of people saw it.
Nobody's talkin'.
Figures.
Oh, look.
Areyou guys seeing
the pattern here?
We got big questions
at both of these crime scenes
with no answers.
Why did they kill the guys
in the other two booths?
Why did they do the bartender?
Fuck!
I hate cold crime scenes!
I'm fucking leaving now.
And do me a favor.
Tell me when the next one does,
'cause these guys
are not done yet.
Fuck you.
Augustus, I need your help.
I have a serious problem.
I am not screwing around here.
I need... Il Duce.
The Duke? Huh.
What did you do?
Rocco-- this package boy--
he could bring down
the whole East Coast.
If he decides
to turn state's evidence,
he could take us apart
brick by brick.
But he's happy, now,
with just killing us
one by one.
And worse, he's good at it.
Listen, kid.
I hope you understand
who you're dealin' with here.
This guy is no slouch.
When I was a boy,
my papa used to speak of him
like he was a ghost.
- Move him.
Your father and I used him
three times in 20 years,
only when things got
totally fucked.
Whenever we needed
one of our own bumped off,
we'd call this guy in.
He had a thing
for clippin' wise guys.
But only one rule
No women, no kids.
Believe me, kid,
you don't want this guy...
unless you are 100% sure
you need him.
He's a fuckin' monster.
But only one thing.
He's been rottin' in the can
the last 25 or 30 years.
Don't even know if he's still
alive or if he's even up to it.
There.
- Well, there are ways around that.
- Yeah. Go find one.
All right.
Let's talk some business here.
I know a sick fuck
makes the ones we been doin'
look like altar boys.
Worst night of my life
when I met this guy.
The guy never says
a fuckin' word to me.
We're drivin' 25 minutes,
never a sigh,
no throat clearing, nothing.
Yeah, you're always making great
fuckin' sense, you dumb bitch.
- I don't care.
His face--blank, man.
Just nothin' there.
This guy takes out
a whole family--
wife, kids, everyone--like
he's ordering a fucking pizza.
This house is clean.
I knew if I didn't keep it
together, it was my ass.
He has a poker game
outback of his place...
with a bunch of wise guys
every Saturday.
Worst day of my life, man.
Well, I'm sold.
Don't worry, Roc.
We'll do this guy right,
and you'll feel a lot better.
Okay.
Here's what happened.
They waited in a parked car down
the street for the kid to leave.
There he goes.
They came in through the garage.
The kid says he leaves it open
when he takes his bike out.
Now they know
the wife is the gatekeeper.
She knows the code.
- Hit the numbers, lady.
Hit the numbers.
- I will kill you! I will kill you!
- Don't! Her hands are tied.
Why do I always gotta be
on bitch detail?
The wife says
she doesn't know what happened
after she hit the code.
She just remembers going down,
but judging from the burn mark
on her back,
I think what they did
was use a stun gun on her.
Now this guy knows
that his friend is coming
to the game,
and they know that this door can
only be opened from the inside.
So they wait.
And when that door opens,
man...
nobody's ready for it.
Panic, devastation.
This was like shootin' fish
in a friggin' barrel.
All of'em.
Now these guys dove
under the table.
The trajectory
on the bullet showed that
they came from straight across.
So that means one of our
shooters dropped to his knees.
-Something went wrong right here.
-Shit! Shit! He ain't here!
Oh, what the fuck you mean,
he isn't here?
- I mean he ain't here!
- Look again, for fuck's sake!
I know what the fuck
he looks like!
Look behind ya!
Ah! Son of a--
Oh, shit!
- Shoot this motherfucker!
No!
Fucking let the bloke go!
- Let him go!
- Fuck! Jesus!
- Now's your chance
to earn your stripes, Roc!
- He'll fucking get killed!
It was your idea
to bring him in!
One of these guys
is a real sicko.
He knew this man.
He wanted him to suffer.
Allright, Roc.
Now's your chance!
- You take that man!
- I don't wanna die!
Sick fuck! Sick fuck!
Sick fuck!
- All right then.
- Fuckyou, fuckin'--
Now take a fuckin' deep breath
there, Roc. You did fine.
It was nicely done.
They exited out the front door.
They had no idea
what they were in for.
Now they're starin'
at six men with guns drawn.
It was a fuckin' ambush.
This was a fuckin' bomb...
droppin' on Beaver Cleaverville.
Fora few seconds,
this place was Armageddon.
There was a firefight!
- You son of a bitch!
Murph, areyou all right?
Motherfucker!
- Roc, get the fucking bag!
- Fuckin' shit! Christ!
- Get the blood! Get the blood!
- What the fuck was that?
- He shot my fucking finger off!.
- Roc, what the fuck?
Get the fuck out of here!
- Motherfucker!
- Fucking shit!
- Get the fucking bag!
- My fucking finger!
Fucking shit!
What if it was just one guy
with six guns?
Why don't you let me do
the thinking, huh, genius?
Hey, what's taking so long
with those blood samples?
I can't get a good sample.
Oh!
There's a variable here
I'm not seeing.
They used ammonia.
None of this is any good.
Fuck!
You know what that means?
Even if we get suspects in the case,
we got nothin',
nothin', nothin'!
Fuck!
Who the fuck are they?
I've never seen
any fucking thing like this
in my fucking life!
Who the fuck are they?
Who the fuck washe, Rocco?
I know you fucking know,
so don't even start.
Fuck you! I told you
I never saw him before!
Well, he sure as fuck knew you!
Fuck you! Fuck you both!
- Yeah? Don't start lying to us now!
We're fuckin'
three amateurs here!
I'm confdent that
their investigation will end...
in the apprehension
of the suspects.
- Fuckin' hell.
- What? What, that guy?
That's the guy
that got us off the hook
with the Checkov thing.
- And he's one smart man.
- They got nothin'.
Well, this guy is very sharp.
If he hasn't figured us out yet,
he will.
- You bet your ass he will.
- Well, I'd say that makes him
a lia-fuckin'-bility.
- He isn't to be touched.
- He's a good man.
Okay, whatever.
No, that's all wrong.
David Della--
I missed it.
Paul, you've already had quite a bit.
Are you sure you wanna--
-Just pour the drink,
you fairy fuck.
Whew! I smell you.
Hey, Murph.
This early mornin'
church shit's gotta go.
We have to go in the mornin'.
We're on the lam now, you know.
Hey.
You're gonna do what I say,
got it?
- Yes.
- I'm sorry you're gonna
have to see this.
- Don't look at me.
- I didn't see any--
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
Don't do this, my son.
Have you no fear of God?
That's who I'm doin' this for.
Now open the fuckin' thing,
Father.
Father,
I'll do you right here.
God have mercy on my soul.
You little fuck, let him go or
I'll drop you right fuckin' now.
Okay,just calm down.
He could hurt us, brother.
- He could ruin the whole thing.
- You let him go...
or I will deliver you
right fucking here!
You won't do it.
You won't, Conner.
You love me, man.
- I swear to fuckin'--
- Hello. You there?
Y-Yes, my son.
Do your thing, Father.
Don't fuck this up.
- How long since your last confession?
- Christ.
I've never confessed.
I come here for advice,
not ""salvation.''
Why have you come
to a church for counsel
if you're not religious?
It's ethics.
I put evil men behind bars,
but the law has miles
of red tape and loop holes...
for these cocksuckers
to slip through.
I found... out
there are these two guys...
who fix the situation
with an iron fist...
as if they had God's permission.
God's permission?
God doesn't grant--
In this day and age,
I believe what they do
is necessary.
I feel it is correct.
A soul
is what gives us feelings.
It's like a conduit...
through which
the Lord speaks to us.
You felt your answers
would be here...
in the house
of the Lord today.
And you feel...
these men are necessary.
So the Lord has spoken to you
twice today.
Has He now?
You are the one who came
into this church speaking
about beliefs and feelings.
Is it so hard to believe
that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
It's very easy
to be sarcastic about religion.
But it's much more difficult...
to take a stand.
I wanna stand
for what I believe in, Father.
First you have to know
what your beliefs are.
I believe that these young men
are right.
- You know them personally?
- Yes.
Would they ever harm an innocent
person, for any reason?
No. They would never do that.
Well, the two
Irish guys wouldn't.
The Italian guy, he might.
He's kind of an idiot.
I'm beginning to see.
All the things
I wish I could do,
these guys are doing.
W-W-What should I do?
Because I am a man...
who's supposed
to uphold the law.
The laws of God...
are higher...
than the laws... of man.
Yes, I-I was thinking that too.
No, no. I was feeling it.
All I needed
was to hear you say it.
Amen. I will help them.
- Forgive me, Father.
- Thank you, Father.
Whatever.
Amen. Good-bye.
Now listen.
Um, "dominus ominus, ''you know.
And remember, you're bound.
You can't talk to anyone
about this. No one.
- Just get out of the church.
- Okay.
Just get out of the church!
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.
What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?
- That's all you can give me?
- The light hit the side
of his face.
Looked like he had a gray beard.
Maybe late '50s, early '60s.
So you're telling me
it was one guy with six guns,
and he was
a senior freakin' citizen?
Yeah, and it's better
if we fnd this man
before he finds us again.
I'll see what I can do.
How do I get in touch with you?
We'll hit Pappa Joe tonight,
right in the comfort
of his own home.
We're gonna move on to New York.
It's just--
- It's getting a bit hot for us here.
- Be careful.
All right.
Call you tonight, afterwards.
- It feels like it's still there.
- Yeah, but it's not.
I don't know who he is.
Nobody does.
The Duke'sa fuckin' Houdini.
He does a disappearin' act.
What did he bring him in for?
Well, he needs an outsider.
This Rocco kid is smart.
He knows everyone.
He'd spot our hitters
a mile away.
Just for him-- the package boy?
He's the one shootin' up
all his guys, right?
He's scared of the kid.
- Said he's good. He's got
every gun in the city up there.
- Up where?
Up at his house.
I don't know what's going on,
but I know it's gotta have
something to do with this kid.
Oh, fuck!
We got 'em.
They tried to get in
through the basement.
- How many?
- Three.
Where you goin; huh?
Where the fuck you goin; huh?
I'm fuckin' talkin' to you,
motherfucker!
- Fuck you!
- Shut up!
Shh! Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Shh.
Sit up.
You have some answers
for me, no?
Yeah. Fuck you.
Roc! Roc, look at me!
- Roc!
Shit!
- Roc!
- Roc! Roc, you'll be fine!
- Roc!
Okay.
What do you boys think?
- These guys are tough.
- Fuckin'-A, right.
- Ain't no fuckin' way
they're gonna talk.
- I know Rocco.
He ain't smart enough
for this shit. Those other
guys are the brains.
- He's just a player.
- He's a punk.
There's only one thing to do.
God! No!
- Roc! Roc! No!
Roc! Roc!
- No!
No! Roc!
Roc!
You can't stop!
You get out of here.
Don't ever stop.
Roc! No!
No! Roc!
- You motherfucker!
Yeah!
I'm gonna kill them!
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah, Chappy?
I don't mean no disrespect,
but I think we're forgettin'
something here.
This Il Duce's a fuckin' animal.
He's gonna stop
when someone dies.
I guarantee you right now,
he thinks this thing is on.
- What?
If this guy still thinks
the job is on,
motherfucker is in the bushes
right now.
I am going.
You four... stay here...
and deal with it.
Do it!
-Just one fuckin' guy.
- Fuck you, Geno.
- What's the big fuckin' deal?
- Do it!
I'm going back downstairs
and workin' on these pricks.
- What the fuck?
Hey.
Joey Bevo sent me over...
as entertainment.
Sorry, baby. Tonight
ain't the night for this shit.
It's really hittin'
the fan in there,
you know what I'm sayin'?
Fuckin' Bevo's great, man.
He's always sendin' us
primo box.
All right. Let's go.
