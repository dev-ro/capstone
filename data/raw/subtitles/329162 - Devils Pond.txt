And do you, Julianne,
take this man to be
your lawful husband,
to have and to hold
from this day forward,
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and health,
until death do you part?
I do.
Mitch, repeat after me.
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring, I thee wed.
You have exchanged rings.
You have exchanged vows.
And so, by the power
vested in me
by this great state,
before god and these witnesses,
I now pronounce you
man and wife.
First of all, thank you
to Julianne's mother Kate
and her husband Charlie
for throwing this great party.
And I'd like to thank my dad,
and I'd like to thank my dad,
who couldn't be here... Today.
He always said that if I
were to tie the knot
with a woman that I hadn't
been dating for at least a year,
he'd throw me in the cellar,
and I think in this case
he would make
a very big exception.
And I'd like to thank
my truck...
For not working most of the time
and making me take the bus
that night that I met Julianne.
And finally, I'd like
to thank my wife
for locking up my heart
and throwing away thkey.
For locking up my heart
and throwing away thkey.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh, are you sure
you want to do this?
Yes, mother, I'm sure.
Ok. So be careful.
I want you to come back
safe and sound
for my birthday party.
I will see you in 2 weeks.
All right, darling.
Bye. Bye-bye.
Whoo!
Get me the fuck out of here.
Yes, ma'am.

Hey, Mitch?
2 weeks, all to ourselves.
We did it.
We can do whatever we want
out here.
We can do whatever we want
out here.
So, how'd you find this place?
It was a hunting trip
with my dad,
about a year ago.
And there's no running water?
Nope.
No television?
Nope.
No electricity,
Internet access, telephone?
We can stay longer
if you want to.
How'd I let you
talk me into this place?
"Oh, Mitch,
take me on an adventure.
"I--I've got to get away
from all this country club b.S."
Shut up!
I do not sound like that.
"Mitch, I love
your adventurous spirit."
"Mitch, I love
your adventurous spirit."
All right, fine.
2 weeks is more than enough
for me, though.
Or maybe 3. We could do 3.
2 weeks.
But I thought you--
There was a glimmer
in your eye--
Mitch, 2 weeks!
When I said 3, you perked up.
There it is.
All aboard.
Are you sure that thing's safe?
This boat? Come on.
She's a tank.
Comes on, Jules.
I would never let anything
happen to you.
You know that.
Heh.
My dad used to bring us
to a place like this
when we were kids.
No matter where we moved,
he'd always bring us
right back to the woods.
My brothers and me
would spend hours
pretending we were
on a chain gang.
It was countless hours of fun.
I'd get lost in a second.
Ah, that was the fun part.
You're crazy.
I gotta call my mom.
She's probably having
a nervous breakdown by now.
All right.
What's the matter, babe?
You said you checked
to see if there was
service here, right?
Yeah, and the guy
said it would work.
It's not working.
Hmm. You wanna go back?
No. You said it was
an adventure, right?
Right.
But won't your mom
kind of... Freak out?
Yep.
What are those?
Oh, that's an old tradition.
Hunters use hash marks
to count out the nights
that they've been here,
how many animals they got.
Stuff like that.
"We were here, got some deer.
Back next year.
S.R. And j.R. '82."
Poetic.
Poetic.
I could fix this place up a bit.
You don't like it here?
No, I love it.
It's... Rustic.
Keep up the tradition.
Very nice.
I'm gonna go get stuff
out of the truck
before it gets dark, OK?
Ow!
Mitch, I hurt myself.
Babe, you OK?
I stubbed my toe.
Is that better?
No.
How about now?
No? Not good enough?
Come here.
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.
Like clockwork.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Hi.
You know, today is our
2-day anniversary.
How do you want to celebrate?
Let's order room service.
Ooh, that sounds good.
I'll call the front desk.
Hey, babe, is that
leaking down there?
Yep.
What about now?
Yep!
What about now, babe?
Yep.
Mitch...
Mitch...
Yeah?
Are you actually trying
to fix the roof
or just make more holes in it?
That's... Pretty funny, huh?
Aah!
Tell me a campfire story.
I don't know, babe.
All the campfire stories I know
are a little scary.
Come on. I'm tougher
than you think.
What do you think
about the name Jack?
Jack?
Yeah.
Yeah, or Hugh, maybe.
Little huey.
Come on. You know
we talked about this.
Come on. You know
we talked about this.
I want to someday, just not now.
I know, but I was just
thinking about someday.
I don't know.
I guess it's just, like,
this is the first time
I've ever even been on my own.
Don't you think I should
at least finish classes?
Yeah.
My little Picasso. Heh.
I hope our kids
get your creative genes.
I--
Mitch!
I do. You've got something
really special, babe.
Really.
Really.
In a parallel universe,
I'm still at school,
making my mom proud,
learning how to spay
little kittens,
plus, I'd still be with Anthony.
Heh. Mr. trust fund.
Hey, Mr. jealous,
I meant it as a compliment.
Well, he could certainly never
take you to a place like this.
And that's why you owe me
the full camping experience.
So now please tell me
a campfire story.
Ok.
How about the one
where a couple
goes on their honeymoon
where a couple
goes on their honeymoon
way out in the woods,
and they sit
and roast marshmallows
and get terrorized
by the local maniac.
Ooh, I don't like that story.
Heh heh heh.
Tell me the story about...
The prince...
Who rescues
his damsel in distress,
and they live
happily ever after.
Why don't you come in?
The water looks cold.
It looks co...
You know what?
I think it's time
for you to get wet.
No, Mitch! I don't
want to go in the water!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Go away, Mitch! I'm serious.
The water's not that bad.
I don't--Mitch, no.
I don't want to go in, Mitch.
It's fine, once
you get used to it.
Mitch, I don't want to go in.
Mitch, please, I--
Mitch, please, I--
Mitch, I really don't want
to go in the water, Mitch!
Mitch, please!
Oh, what's the matter?
I just--
I put on my makeup,
and it's gonna get
all messed up.
Ok, well, why don't we just--
Why don't I just
set you on the raft?
There we go.
Don't worry, honey.
You won't get wet.
I anchored the raft
to a rock, baby.
It won't float away. I promise.
Just relax.
Aah!
Mitch!
Mitch, help!
Aah!
Come on. I got you.
Don't you ever
leave me like that!
Damn you, Mitch!
What are you mad at me for?
I--i didn't know
the raft was gonna sink.
I can't swim.
You never learned
how to... Swim?
I'm afraid of the water.
Julianne, why would you
let me bring you here?
Because I thought
that maybe if I was with you
that I would get over it.
I didn't think that you were
just gonna leave me like that.
Well, why didn't you
just tell me?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. Ok?
That's OK.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
You always fall asleep
afterwards.
You always fall asleep
afterwards.
I'm sorry, babe.
I don't mean to.
Mitch...
Yeah, baby?
Would you still love me
if I died my hair black?
Yes, I would.
What if I shaved my head?
Yes, I would still love you,
but I like your hair a lot.
What if I got fat?
Baby, you thinking about
changing your hair?
Baby, you thinking about
changing your hair?
Is that what this is about?
I like it the way it is,
but if you want to change it,
that's fine.
Forget it.
I love the way
your cheeks smell.
God, I wish I could
just bottle it up
and take it with me
wherever I went.
Then I could open it up
and have you right next to me,
then I could open it up
and have you right next to me,
no matter where you are.
Mwah! Hi, baby. Hey, babe.
Can I try?
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Sure.
Here.
Now you got to grip it here,
then you take the line
and hold it up.
Now with this hand,
you flip over the bail.
Now, when you go to cast it out,
let go with your index finger.
Not bad. Heh. Not bad at all.
Now reel it in quick.
The lure will sink.
There you go.
I notice that you have,
um, a safe box inside.
Yeah.
Why do you have it?
Just for security.
Security from who?
We're in the middle of nowhere.
You never know, Jules.
What's in it?
Car keys, stuff like that.
It's not a big deal, Jules.
Ok? It's nothing.
I didn't say it was a big deal.
I was just asking.
Well, stop asking, OK?
I didn't bother you
about all that makeup
that you trucked in here.
I mean, Jesus,
who the hell do you have
to look good for
out here anyway?
Hey, Jules, will you
come out here for a second?
I want to show you something.
You made me an easel.
So you can work. You know?
Do your painting.
I'm sorry, Julianne.
So, you still--
You still love me?
So, you still--
You still love me?
You know, I was thinking.
Maybe we could take a trip--
Into town today, you know?
Buy a newspaper,
eat at a restaurant,
maybe call my family.
I thought you wanted
an adventure.
I do, but, I mean,
don't you want to see
what's going on
in the world, you know?
What's going on
in the world, you know?
Anything?
This looks pretty good.
Anyway, my mom's
probably freaking out,
so I should really call her.
That's over an hour
away, Julianne.
I know, but what's
an hour out here?
I mean, time
practically stands still.
There we go.
That ought to do it.
And what happens
to the poor little animal?
Ah.
You know, most of the time,
you know, most of the time,
the smaller animals
don't even survive the impact.
Julianne?
Julianne!
You OK?
Yeah. I'm fine,
but you've got to be
more careful out here.
Ow, baby, you're
hurting my wrist.
Don't you think we should
start thinking about
heading back soon?
What?
Well, it's been 10 days,
and I was just thinking--
We said we'd be here 2 weeks.
I know... And it's
been wonderful.
It's just that, you know,
I'm really excited
about going home
and starting our lives together.
Start our lives together?
Julianne, this
is our lives together.
Julianne, this
is our lives together.
It's just that...
I've never gone
more than a couple of days
without talking to my mom.
Well, it's not like
she's going anywhere.
I--i mean, look
around you, Julianne.
Everything here...
This is us. This--
This is our lives together.
This is where we need to start,
where it's just you and me.
I want to go home, Mitch.
I get this whole nature
and earth and woods thing.
I do, but I want to go home.
Let's go.
No.
What do you mean no?
I mean no, Julianne. No.
Are you not listening to me?
I said I want to go home.
This is our honeymoon.
We can't just quit
before it's over.
So I figure, if we leave now,
we could probably--
Julianne.
And I don't really think
we're gonna hit the--
Julianne, we're not leaving!
What is your problem?!
What is my problem?!
When we both decide
that it's time to leave,
that is when we will leave!
You're in a bad mood right now,
and that's fine.
It's gonna pass.
But don't fuck up
our whole honeymoon
because you miss
your goddamn mother.
Fuck you! You were the one
who said the cell phone
would work up here.
I told you already
that the fuckin' guy
on the phone
told me that it was gonna work!
What the fuck was I
supposed to do, Julianne?
Drive up here
and test it myself?
Yeah, maybe you should have.
Yeah, maybe you should have.
Would that have
made you happy, Princess?
This place has
done something to you, Mitch.
You've never
acted like this before.
What's going on?
You know what? I'll tell you
what's going on, Julianne.
I am your husband now,
and you are my wife!
I'm not some flunky boyfriend
that you can just kick around
as you see fit,
and if I don't leave,
then you don't leave!
I'm going to check my traps.
Uhh! Uhh!
Unh!
Yah!
Fuck!
Aah! Fuck!
Uhh! Ooh!
Uhh!
Ahh.
Julianne...
I'm sorry I yelled at you. I--
I should have never
yelled at you like that.
It'll never happen again.
I promise.
Ok?
If you just knew
how much I loved you.
Hey, Jules, wake up.
You gotta see this.
There's the craziest bird.
He keeps flying
around in circles,
and he just landed
on the edge of the island.
I've never seen a bird
act so crazy.
Mitch...
Yeah?
Have you seen
my second case of pills?
What pills, babe?
My--you know, the pill.
No. Should I have?
Tell me honestly, Mitch.
Did you take them?
Why would I take your pills?
Ah!
God-fucking-damn it!
Whoa, whoa, baby. Take it easy.
Don't tell me what to do!
What the fuck is goin'
on with you lately?
What the fuck is goin'
on with you lately?
Mitch, we have to leave.
You know what?
I thought we already
worked that out.
What the hell
did we work out, Mitch,
that I have to stay here
till you say so?
No. We said
we'd be here 2 weeks.
And I'm out of pills.
So?
What does that mean?
Do you not know
what the pill is?
Yes, Julianne, I know
what the pill is,
but I don't know why
you're makin' such
a big deal out of it.
What's the worst
that's gonna happen?
I could get pregnant, Mitch.
What part of this
don't you understand?
Well, we're married now,
Julianne.
We can afford to
take chances like that,
can't we?
Can't we?
I mean, we both said
that we wanted to
have a family someday.
Someday. Mitch, I said
I want to have kids
with you someday, not now.
You can't go around
planning out every
moment of your life.
Sometimes things
just have to happen.
What is that, a fortune cookie?
No, but if we were
following your plans,
Julianne, we'd be
at home right now,
doing the same shit
that we do every goddamn day,
and if we followed
your mother's plans,
you'd probably be
a veterinarian right now
and we wouldn't even be married,
but what about my plans?
When are we gonna start
to follow my plans?
When are we gonna start
to follow my plans?
What are you talkin' about?
Why can't you understand me
when I'm talking to you?
I do understand.
You're a very smart girl,
and I'm speaking
very simple English,
am I not?
Maybe if you stop
fucking telling me
what to do all the time
and actually listened
to what I'm saying.
I'm listening. You're my wife,
and I can't even count
on you to understand me?
How can I trust you
to ever listen to me?
Ok, I'm listening.
Good, because we
are not leaving.
How was the water?
You OK?
Yeah. I'm just gonna go to bed.
Hey, what do you say you and me,
we try some more
fishin' tomorrow?
Whatever.
Then I can show you my--
Show you my special move.
How am I doing?
You're a natural.
But be careful out there.
You're not wearin'
a life preserver.
I'll be OK.
What are you doing?
Shit. Damn it.
What are those?
Just give it back.
This is mine.
Where'd you get this?
The evergreen?
That's where me
and Anthony used to go.
I know.
That night we met
at the bus stop...
You were there...
You followed me.
You were never even waiting
for the bus at all, were you?
What did you do after I got off,
what did you do after I got off,
catch another bus
on the way back?
You did, didn't you?
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Was I supposed to just
walk up to you and say,
"hey, I've been following you.
How about a cocktail?"
Yeah. At least it would
have been the truth.
You're a pretty girl, Julianne.
You stick out in a crowd.
It's not a crime to notice you.
Sure, I'd seen you there
once or twice.
Sure, I'd seen you there
once or twice.
So, Mitch...
How long have you
been stalking me?
Stalking you?
Jesus Christ.
What else you got in there?
Mitch, listen to me.
It's been 14 days.
I'm leaving. Give me the keys.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry, Julianne.
I didn't mean to leave you
on the island alone.
I know how much you
hate to be alone.
I just--i needed
to blow off some steam,
get out of here
for a little while.
It's not because you
left me alone.
It's not because you
left me alone.
Look, we can work this out.
We can.
No.
How can we make a marriage work
if we can't make 2 weeks work?
I don't know.
Maybe things will get
better when we get back.
Why would things get any better,
because you have more excuses
to get away from me?
Excuses to get away from you?
Yeah. You're always goin'
out with your friends.
I never know where
the hell you are--
My friends are not excuses
to get away from you.
They're my friends.
They're country club snobs,
and you know that.
You are so insecure.
You better shut up, Julianne.
You better fucking shut up.
What's your problem, Mitch?
Are you afraid that
I'm just gonna walk
are you afraid that
I'm just gonna walk
in some garden party
and meet someone
smarter than you?
Shut up, Julianne.
They'll certainly
be richer than you.
Better shut--
Better than you.
Julianne!
Don't fuckin' push me!
You're just
a little spoiled brat
that's been pampered
her whole life,
and now you want to run
back home to mommy, huh?
You said you wanted to
escape all that.
You said you wanted to
do something different.
Well, do it. I am doing it.
Bullshit! You've never
done anything on your own
in your entire life!
You've always had your mother
lookin' over your shoulder.
And you know what?
You're just like her.
Everything is always about you.
I'm surprised your real father
I'm surprised your real father
made it as long as he did.
And yours is any better?
Why wasn't he at
our wedding, Mitch, huh?
Are you just ashamed of me,
or maybe you're
just ashamed of him.
Jules, don't you go
turnin' this around on--
And don't call me Jules!
Why not?
Because Anthony used to.
That's why.
Fuck him!
I did, plenty of times,
and he didn't
fall asleep afterwards.
You know what?
I will fucking kill you.
Mitch, just give me the keys.
Don't you fucking ever,
ever touch that key--
Ah!
No.
Julianne!
Come on, please.
Hello?
Mom? Hello?
No.
No.
No, no, please.
Fucking battery!
Julianne.
Julianne, the sun's
gonna set soon.
Julianne, the sun's
gonna set soon.
Julianne, baby, I'm sorry
I got mad at you,
and it won't happen again.
But you don't
want to be out here
when the sun goes down, baby.
You don't.
Julianne.
Julianne, can you hear me?
There you are.
Thank god you found me.
I'm sorry.
Julianne, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
I just got so scared.
I will never lose my temper
like that again, I swear.
Just don't leave me,
OK? Don't run away.
Let's go home.
Ah! Good morning.
Where's the boat?
What's that, babe?
Where's the boat, Mitch?
Don't know.
It must've sank.
Don't worry about it,
though, Jules.
I can still swim.
Yes.
Yes!
Come on. Come on.
Yes. Yes.
Any luck, babe?
No, not yet.
Well, if you
want to catch anything,
you just let me know, all right?
I'm goin' out
for a little while.
Where are you goin'?
I got stuff I gotta do.
Mitch?
Nothing.
You sure you want to do this?
Like clockwork.
Oh, come on.
Goddamn it, come on!
Fuck.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, please.
Eh!
Fuck.
Ah!
Don't do anything
stupid, Julianne.
Why doesn't
the fucking car work?
Fix it.
Fix the fucking car!
Mitch?
Mitch!
Oh, no.
Mitch!
Mitch!
Mitch!
Mitch!
I knew you'd try to run,
Julianne.
You been actin' crazy
lately, Jules.
Really crazy.
I mean, how many times
am I gonna have to save you?
Hmm?
You wanna drown?
Is that what you want,
baby? Do you wanna drown?
Well, I'm assuming that you
saw the deed to the house.
Well, I'm assuming that you
saw the deed to the house.
So I'm guessing
that you know who that is
buried in the woods.
Well, you always wanted
to meet my father.
He's right over there...
Where we could be close to him.
He loved this place.
You would've liked him
a lot, Julianne.
He looked a lot like me.
It was just an accident.
You know?
I mean, hunting accidents
happen all the time.
I mean, hunting accidents
happen all the time.
He was always bugging me
about finding the right girl
and starting a family.
He said, "Mitch,
"you're not a real man
unless you have
a family of your own."
I think he would've been
real proud of us.
And you have no idea
how hard it is
to make a dead man proud.
I was hopin' that you would've
got to like it here...
A little bit better
before I told you,
a little bit better
before I told you,
but since you saw the deed,
I guess you know
that the house is mine.
And since we're married,
that means that you have
part of it, too.
Doesn't that make you happy?
Isn't that better
than living in some house
that your stepfather
bought for us?
We have each other,
and we have food,
and we have water,
and we have shelter,
and we have beautiful
fucking views.
What more could anyone
ask for? Huh?
What more could anyone
ask for? Huh?
And you're still trying
to run away from it.
I don't understand you,
Julianne.
I just...
I just need to protect you.
I just need to protect you
from yourself.
Just for a little while
until you get better.
And you know what, Julianne,
this place...
Is a fucking mess.
If your mother saw this place...
I mean, what the fuck?!
What the fuck?!
You would never let
your fucking stepfather's place
look like this! Huh?
And you know what, Julianne?
You know what?
I bet you think that I'm
punishing you, don't you?
Is that what you think?
You think I'm punishing you?
I'm not at all.
I'm showing you, Julianne.
I'm showing you. Look.
Stuff like this?
Look at this.
Fuckin' 12.95
for a tube of paint
this fucking big!
For a tube of paint
this fucking big!
Huh? Why do you need
expensive things
to make you happy?
Julianne.
Come here.
God, you are so beautiful.
Ohh!
Fucking clean this up.
Oh, hi, sweetie.
I'm just makin' a little dinner.
I mean, it's nothing much.
It's just some leftovers
thrown together, you know,
'cause I couldn't make it
to the store today.
Oh, I guess I just
shouldn't complain.
I don't wanna be the old...
I don't wanna be the old...
Ball and chain.
Anyway...
How 'bout you?
How are you doing?
Huh?
I just wanna get a match.
Jesus Christ, Julianne.
Thanks.
Look, I'm worried
about you, Julianne.
I mean, this setup
is only temporary,
you know that, right?
I mean, when you stop trying
to jump into the water--
And how the fuck will you
know when that is, Mitch?
I am chained to a goddamn tree!
I can't even go in the water.
I don't know, Julianne,
but maybe when you're
not in such a bad mood.
I know that I hold
on to you too tight...
Jules. I...
I know I do,
and I see myself do it,
and I hate it,
but I can't stop it.
And I hate it,
but I can't stop it.
I'm nothing without you.
And I didn't want things
to be this way,
not at all,
but they're gonna get better.
They are.
Really soon, Julianne.
I promise.
Today is my mom's birthday.
I was supposed to go back
for her party, remember?
I was supposed to go back
for her party, remember?
You know...
Eventually someone's
gonna come out here
looking for us...
And when they do,
what are you gonna tell 'em?
Huh?
Does your family
know where we are?
And not that many people
come around this way, Julianne,
so I think you should
probably just get used to it.
And I bet ya
ya knew that, didn't ya?
You knew that they wouldn't
come out here to find us,
'cause they didn't know
where we are.
I bet ya,
you knew that that cell phone
wouldn't work, too, huh?
And did you know
I couldn't swim?
Did you know that I was
scared of the water?
Did you, Mitch?
Because I think you did.
Because I think you did.
I think you knew
all those things.
Think whatever
you wanna think, Julianne.
Just tell me something, Mitch.
Has there ever...
Been one thing...
That you told me...
That hasn't been a lie?
I love you.
And I always will, Julianne.
That was never a lie.
Mitch...
You have to let me go.
You have to let me go.
Loving me doesn't mean...
Just loving the way
I make you feel.
My whole life,
I've had guys like me
for the way I looked.
They never understood me.
They never even made the effort
to find out...
Until you.
I thought you were different.
I thought you were different.
I thought you were
better than them.
You think you love me,
but you don't.
Mitch, please,
please let me go!
Mitch, please!
No.
No!
You walked down that aisle...
And you said those words.
You said for richer
or for poorer,
you said for richer
or for poorer,
in sickness and in health.
You chose those words, Julianne.
And when things go bad,
you don't just walk away.
You stick it out.
But I--i didn't know that you--
What about our family?
What about all the kids
that you wanna have, Julianne?
We could raise them right here.
I mean, don't you see
how much better that is?
We could spare them
from all the cruel things...
But we gotta stop fighting,
because I'm telling you,
you don't wanna bring a child
into this kind of environment.
Into this kind of environment.
Julianne.
Nobody's loved you
like I love you!
Julianne.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away...
Go away...
Mitch!
Mitch!
What?
I was trying to light
the stove and--
And the matches--
What the fuck did you do?
I'm sorry. I was trying
to light the stove and--
Don't we have any more matches?
No, we don't have
any more fucking matches!
I'm sorry.
What the fuck are we
supposed to do now?
Huh? What are we
supposed to cook with?
I don't know.
Well, that's really
fuckin' smart, Julianne.
Now I've gotta go
all the way to fucking town
to get--
You know what?
Fuck that.
Fuck that.
I'm not going anywhere.
Ok.
Don't go anywhere.
Ok.
Ok.
That was fast.
I just lit a cigarette
off the car lighter.
If we keep one going,
we don't need matches, right?
Ok.
I'll make dinner
if you start a fire.
Whatever.
What?
Oh, by the way,
the truck broke down.
Mitch!
Wait!
The truck broke down?
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
We'll be fine without it.
But what if something
happens to one of us?
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'm just saying if, Mitch.
I mean, I know you could
survive without me, but...
What if something
happens to you?
Nothing's gonna happen.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Could we walk?
I don't know. I don't think so.
My cigarette's almost out.
I'm gonna start a fire.
Wait.
I'll build the fire.
You could go light
another cigarette.
You got off the island,
didn't you?
How'd you do it?
I didn't, Mitch, I swear.
How'd you do it?!
Uhh!
Uhh!
You think you're
smarter than me? Huh?!
Is that what you think?
Well, figure this one out.
You are never getting off
of this island!
Uhh!
You fuckin' bastard! I hate you!
Don't you fuckin' say that!
Aah!
I'm gonna kill you!
Aah!
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Unh!
Ohh! Oh!
Uhh.
Do it.
Do it, Julie.
Set yourself right, Mitch.
I can't.
You'll never make it alone!
Good-bye, Mitch.
