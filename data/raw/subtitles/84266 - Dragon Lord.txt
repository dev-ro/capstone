50 points
Your father's coming
Grab it, my lord
Good morning, father
Carry on
That's it, father
Your bath's ready, sir
That's all, Dragon?
No, of course not
Your sword, my lord
Watch this
It's hard work
You got it!
He's coming again
Are you through again?
Speed is the strength of my swordsmanship
This way, please
- Are you full already?
- Yes
Boss!
Good morning, Mr. Chu
Let's have the lesson out here today
How's Dragon doing in his studies?
Excellent. Give him a quiz
I'm ready anytime
Help yourself to breakfast
Are you full?
Father's presence spoils my appetite
He's going to give you a quiz
Have you memorized
Lesson One yet?
'Once upon a time, there was...'
Are you going
anywhere afterwards?
No, nowhere
Do 50 pages of penmanship then
Why don't I do 100?
You'd be exhausted after 50
I don't have
anything to do anyway
Don't fool around
Goodbye, Boss!
Throw it down to me quickly
Don't forget to feed it
Yes
Are you going out?
You've got 100 pages
of penmanship to do
I know. Don't be too late
I won't
Pao, please go to my house
Tell my wife I won't be home for dinner
Now!
I'll help you get started
Ready? One, two, three, four...
Now, One little, two little,
three little Indian
Four little, five little, six little Indian
Seven little, eight little,
nine little Indian...
Ten little Indian
That's easy. Listen to me
One little, two little, three little Indian
You promised not to tease me
I'm not teasing you, I'm translating
What's the occasion?
Answering to the call of nature
Get me one of those zippers,
will you?
My father was put in an order already
I'll wait for you
Hurry up!
Wait. One, two, three
It's over there. Go get it
Turn it off, it's warm
You think this is a tap?
See, it's all over my pants
Run. Sexy!
What?
Hurry
Hurry
Why hasn't Mrs Matchmaker
found her?
She really should have found her for me
Wait a minute
I'm going to help her
Why do we always like the same things?
What are you hinting at?
Just our usual
Head or tail?
Head or tail?
Tail
You lost
Maybe next time
Where's the girl?
- The path uphill
- Thank you
I'll tell your father you'll be late
- That's not true.
- Take your time.
You're putting me on again
The captain has a few words to say
Buddies
We've been running like
mad these few months
The going has been rough
All because of
this shipment of antiques
Mr. Wang,
through his numerous contacts
Has found us
some foreign buyers
we must protect.
It's the end.
In a month or so, After the antiques
After the antiques are on board the lines
we shall all be going home
I trust this is agreeable to you all
Not me
Did you say something, Lieutenant?
We shouldn't sell the nation's treasures
They aren't anymore
The Qing Dynasty
is over
Our Emperor is dead
We don't have a nation
We are still Chinese, aren't we?
These antiques are ancient
Chinese artifacts
They are China's treasures
But if we don't sell them
how are we all going to live?
There are jobs around everywhere
We've fought so many battles
and have risked our lives
for these antiques
If we don't get rid
of them now
we'll definitely
be dead soon!
Jobs are not easy to find these days
You must be tired, Lieutenant
I'm not going along
Captain, it seems...
You stay out
of this
Just line up the liners for us
That I'll do for sure
Chien, you're in charge of security
There's nothing to be shy about
For future's sake, take a good look now
Thanks
I'd be awful to marry the wrong girl
Why are you so quiet today?
Usually
you're the most talkative
These two bastards
What can I do for you?
You're not giving us the pretty ones
No wonder
you haven't found me a wife yet
I've brought her to you once
You said
you didn't like her
Really?
She doesn't look that pretty now
I doubt if I can recognize her
Who?
The prettiest
Who can that be?
She doesn't know any pretty ones
I know every girl
in your village
What's her name?
I don't know her name
I don't know about you
Introduce her to me first
Who the hell are you talking about?
Sexy
Isn't that she?
Shouldn't it be my turn?
Dragon
Why did you drag me here?
I want to tell you a secret
What secret?
It's not your turn today
Why?
Because...
Because... look who's coming?
Uncle Ho
Father
Isn't this the lord?
- What are you two doing?
- Father
Dragon was looking for you
He has written a poem
A Poem?
Let your father hear it
I've got to run
I'm leaving now
Let your father hear your poem
Good bye
Let me hear your poem
Rent a bed?
Jingle bell
Jingle bell...
That's your poem?
That's Lee's poem
You're supposed to be studying
Look how untidy you are
What did you come out for?
Mrs Matchmaker has found a girl
The girl's waiting for us
Really?
That's where Cowboy's going
You'd better hurry then
Can't let Cowboy beat you to her
I'll go right now
If only he had a wife!
Dragon
You should be ashamed of yourself
I'm crazy about her
And I'm not?
I know you do too
Then we're enemies
A lot of brothers kill each other
Because they loved the same woman
I'd never hit you over a woman
I'll figure a way to help you then
How?
I'll let you play hero
Girls always like hero
Who's going to be the villain?
You don't look like one
Kang and Pao look like villains
I'll pay them to play villains
Good
Will you forgive me for just now?
Of course
I knew you would
What do you want?
He is horny
So am I
The two of us
Want to kiss you
She doesn't like us
A nice girl shouldn't have done that
I'll scream if you don't go away
Don't be impatient
Our hero is very punctual
You two perverts
Should be ashamed of yourselves
Don't worry a thing, Miss
You...
My lord
You told us to kidnap the girl
We've got an intruder
You... I...
It's you again?
I...
Last time
you attacked that girl, I
gave you one last chance
But you're doing it again
You betrayed me just now
Are you all right?
I'm mad
I'm fine
Step aside please
Are you all right?
It hurts here
That hurts more than the last one
Listen to me, please
Dragon, you...
Quit fighting, please
Stop now
Listen to me please
Cut it out
What are you doing?
You think you have won?
You used me to prove how good you are
We agreed not to hit each other's nose
I did it
Afraid that your father would know, right?
I'll tell your father
Scold me?
You're a stupid idiot
Let go of me
I couldn't care less if father's here
Dragon
Why are you two
buddies fighting?
Take a look at yourselves
He called me
a stupid idiot
I don't want to
see you again
Go home
I...
You'd better
pay for all damages
What are you standing there for?
What has Dragon been studying lately?
I taught him
Poems of the Tong Dynasty
And Classical Literature
Why don't you give him a quiz?
He has memorized every piece
He knows them backwards
How about Lee's poems?
How about a Classical Essay?
I can recite
"Going to War"
How about "Letter to Su"?
"Letter to Su"
"Letter to Su"
"Letter to Su"...
Start from 'Having lost my way'
'Having lost my way...'
What are you doing?
My foot is very itchy
Can you give me the next phrase?
'I joined the army'
'I packed my bags'
'They sent me out of China'
'Into the dangerous barbarian territories'
'Our troops were outnumbered'
'But they were the bravest'
'We chased the barbarians up north'
Isn't that great?
Are you reciting or not?
I've grown too fond of this piece
Let me hear 'Su's prayer to wife'
That's a tough one
You heard me
'You've gone for ten years'
'But I miss you everyday
Are you thinking of mother?
Keep on reciting
'Last night you came to my dreams'
'We gazed at each other silently'
'But not without tears of sadness'
Carry on
Can I not do this piece?
It reminds you of your mother, right?
Recite 'My house' then
I've wiped that one off
What did you say?
I've wiped that one off my mind
You shouldn't forget
what you've learned
If you can't recite it today
Mr Chu deserves to be fired
You can do it, Dragon
You two go clean up the kitchen
Now let me hear it
Can I do 'My song' instead?
'My house'
This is my latest painting
I've also done others too
Why don't you just recite
'My house'?
Yes, father
'A house needs not
to be on a hill'
Stand still
'It should show my personality'
'My personality'
'Personality...
'Trees'
'Trees'...
'Point?'
Well?
Well?
I don't really know
'Trees... climb'
Have some tea!
'Climb...'
'The window'
'Trees... trees'
What are you doing?
Freeze!
'Trees climb the roof and looking...'
'And looking'
Have some green tea
'And looking green'
Freeze over there
What kind of recital was that?
You have had
so many tutors
Go memorize your lessons
Yes father
Post...
What?
Nothing
That's not right
What kind of tutor are you?
No dinner for
you two tonight
Memorize it today
or stay home forever
I can't concentrate if you're here!
'A house needs not
to be on a hill'
'It should
show my personality'
'Trees climb the roof and looking green'
'I have a lot of visitors'
'They like me'
You skipped two lines
I know. 'I've a lot of visitors'
And then?
'I've a lot of visitors'
From all provinces
Did you teach him that?
No
It's 'We read to each other'
'We read to each other'
'It is peaceful and educational'
I know all of your games
You've got it wrong
I'm a master of tricks myself
Get changed and go to Uncle Wang's
You two freeze
I'll work hard
and won't disappoint you
I hope so
Thank you so much
- Don't mention it
- Have some tea
Give this to the lord
We haven't done this
for a long time
That's true
Go apologize
to your buddy
That's not necessary
I'll show you
some of my flowers
Okay!
Visit with Chin
You want to take a look?
It's a gift from me
I've got something even better
This is called a telescope
Good for peeping
I'll show you a rifle
What's a rifle?
This is a rifle
It blows out fire?
It can kill a tiger
This way?
You need gunpowder
Are you all right?
Yes
Where's the gunpowder?
I've got it
Gunpowder
How do you work it?
Pour it in here
How much?
As you like
Let's try that
What's this?
Iron balls
How many do you need?
I don't know
Let's try that
Wait
Got to stuff it
That's how my father does it
Okay
Try it out
You try it!
Face outside
I don't want to face garden
Why didn't it work?
What's the problem?
Does it work?
Did we do too much stuffing?
Maybe the gunpowder's wet
I can't see anything
We're in deep trouble
You go home.
I'll take care of this
This is my home
I'll go home then
One person is better than two
I'll do your
'I won't touch guns' lines for you
He took away nothing
I don't believe it
Have you gone over the inventory?
We didn't lose a single item
He may come back to steal
Then we'll be in trouble
We must find him
Yes
Give me a few men
Let's go
I'll crawl in with the rifle
Did you hear it?
Yes, so many of them
This is the pheasants' home
The noises have stopped
We're being surrounded by pheasants
We'll be rich then
It's over there
I can't find my way out
The pheasants should be around
They are not here
Look over there then
I did
Go look again
I can't find them
How can?
These eggs are big
Let go of me
What are you doing here?
Whatever you're doing?
Follow me
Over there!
I got it
Are you all right now?
Captain, we've got the wrong one
You can't tell
between men and pheasants
It flew towards that way
Are you all right, Dragon?
We're sorry
Wait
just one minute
Your turn
You scared away my pheasant
And kicked me
so many times
I'm sorry
We came here first
You scared away
our pheasant
Ganging up on two kids?
We'll go over there
You should have done that already
We'll mind each other's own business
Don't you trespass my territory
Or I'll be mad
- Are you okay?
- Okay
We've got the game tomorrow
No, I just felt weak
I wasn't scared
Where's the pheasant?
Over there
Captain
We couldn't find him
He must be hiding somewhere
He may report us to the police
We'll be long gone
I want him
dead or alive

for the Dragons
One more goal to tie up the game
Another one to win
We've got a new score now

are very upset
They'd better
be careful now

in vain
Another wonderful save
by King
The Dragons don't look
tired at all

to tie the game

Fox was dragged down
onto the floor
That maybe
a penalty kick
It is
a penalty kick
The Braves have got a good goalie
Dragon scored
for The Dragons
That was a superb display
of technique
The game is tied up at
three to three
Who will be the winner?
There isn't much time left
much time left
Both teams
are anxiety-ridden now
Time's up
That's another score
No use. Time's up
The Braves are
surrounding the referee
but the goal doesn't count
Because time was up
but the goal doesn't count
Still 3:3
They are going to have extra game
and I need to take a break
Let me have a sip of water
We can win if we wanted
Time is saving you,
three more minutes on the field
The Dragons will win for sure
I need to talk to you, Mr. Ho
Yes?
Do you think that girl's pretty?
The game will
resume soon
All right
We're into overtime now

It is another penalty
I think The Dragons are going to lose
Time will be up
after the penalty
The Dragons are
all very sad
Don't be fooled again
What should I do?
It's your decision
The referee is urging Killer
to shoot
Killer is stalling the game
Killer is playing
tricks again
King has sent the shuttle-cock
up the court
Dragon scored and time ran out
The Dragons won
That was a tough
tough game
The Braves are
really disappointed
The Dragons
represent East town
This year's Shuttle-cock Cup
Has found its rightful owner
Let's go get the prize
I injured someone
Who?
That girl over there
Go to her
Get the prize
Hold this for me
- Where are you going?
- The bookshop
The lord's girlfriend is over there
Where are you going?
Please listen to me, miss
Stay away from us
What?
You're not forceful enough
Forceful?
What now?
My friend wants to apologize to you
Speak up
I'm sorry
Is that all?
That was
really ridiculous
I have a lot to say to her
But she doesn't want to listen to you
Why not write her a letter?
And slide it in underneath the door?
That's too old-fashioned
Send it by registered mail?
That takes too long
What's a fast and classy way?
Airmail
Airmail?
That's old-fashioned
It works though
A love letter sounds awful
But everybody
writes it
Bring it here
Will she get it?
Calculate the wind speed
correctly
And it will fly
to her doorsteps
Lift
It's up
The letter, my lord
Watch the wind
The Wind's fine
How's the wind?
Go ahead
Fly to Sexy's
The wind has stopped
Can I cut it?
When I said cut...
you cut it
Wait...
You can cut it now
You're cut it already?
Weren't you watching the wind?
The wind changed its direction
We'll make another one
All right
Another one?
There's a love letter
up there
That's right
Write another letter
East town has a fat woman also called Sexy
My lord, my lord
It's me
Why are you here?
To pick up my kite
Softer please
Softer please
Okay
Get down here
I'm picking up my kite
Hold it
Let him go
Captain
It's all right
He's your son's buddy?
Yes, he's just a naughty kid
I wouldn't worry
over him
I'm not forcing you to get married
Mrs Matchmaker
Let Sexy knows she's rejected
The one who lives at Flower Lane?
I'll let her know
Sexy?
She's the one?
I love you, father
When will you grow up, son?
I'll turn her down
Please don't do that
Will you make up your mind?
I'll buy you a bottle of perfume
Really?
How can I meet her?
At the temple on the 15th
- The 15th?
- Don't forget my perfume.
Make sure it's from Paris
Of course
Where's Kang?
My lord
Why have you bought so many things?
You can eavesdrop on her
Be hurry, go!
Stay here
Yes
You're going to die, Lieutenant
I need some divine enlightenment
Would Dragon make
a good husband?
If yes, give me an A stick
If not,
give me a F stick
Please help me,
divine one
Give her
an A stick
And I'll pay you respect regularly
I've bought you gifts today
Burning it
You are stealing the nation's treasures
Just surrender the pieces
you took
I can gave you a chance
A stick?
Chance? I'll get it myself
It's an A stick
I don't think you have any choice
A F stick?
Remember our pheasant hunt?
Sure, it's them all right
It's those two idiots
This is
a criminal act
Are you trying to kill him?
Don't you have consciences?
Captain forbids hurting outsiders
Have anyone notified the police?
How can you do that
to a dying man?
You two are
number one cowards
Bullying defenseless persons
Why don't you take me?
He hit me
That's like hitting me
Sexy is watching
I know. Just watch
Be careful
What we need now
is a brave man
You again?
It's true
you look funny
But you shouldn't feel ashamed
You...
Well?
Stay cool
Two against one?
We need more space then
Will everybody move aside please?
Are you all right?
Sure
You're asking for it
You're a dead man
The brave is not afraid
of death
if I got killed
by these two animals
Make me a shrine
and place it over there
Let everybody know what I died for
And who my murderers were
Make sure they use concrete
Idiot
Watch behind you
I'm fine
Stop hitting him
Come kill me
Hit him
Don't upset the crowd
Let nobody move
We want to save this man, right?
Right
You two ought to be ashamed of yourself
Stay cool
But I'm not afraid
Lieutenant is
a dying man anyway
Let's leave here
We won't be ganging up
on you
Don't you run away
Don't let me run into you again
Lord Dragon
Let me down
What about
the injured man?
Quiet please
We should finish what we've started
My father will pay
for all damages
Bring the injured man out here
Then see if the old woman's hurt
Get me a board
Where should we bring him?
Bring him
to my house
Our barn is bigger than
your house
Bring him to your barn then
That we'll do
Making wishes?
Don't be too superstitious
Right
The divine one answers my prayers
What stick did you get?
An A stick
Is that right?
I want to visit you at your house
Did I invite you?
Get going now
Dragon
You fought like a thug just now
Not like when you are practicing
Fighting and practicing
are different
I stole a few pieces
from their collection
You said we own a share
of the treasures?
Every Chinese owns a share
There are 30 million Chinese
We own 2-30 millionth then
How much is that?
I don't really know
I shouldn't be too little anyway
How's he?
He passed out
Too much bleeding
Go buy some bandages
I have to
go home anyway
Can I leave you alone here?
Sure, this place is safe
I'm leaving then
Hurry back
Don't let my father see you
The stolen pieces are precious
They are the cream of this collection
You're saying...
Without those pieces
The collection would sell half
the original price
Mr. Wang
Are you threatening me?
You want to talk to
the buyers yourself?
No, I don't
Where's the Captain?
In there
Captain
We've found him
He's in Wang's house
So Lieutenant
and Wang are together
You go there now
I'll be there soon
Yes
Where are all your servants
Cowboy?
It's their day off
I've brought this medicine
Is he all right?
He's still unconscious
That's getting serious then
Why don't you
get the medicine ready?
Get me some matches
will you?
I can't move
What's wrong with you?
It's some old injury
And it affects your eyes?
No
Where are the matches?
We don't have any here
Go get me some then
Go now
I don't want to move
What do you want to do then?
Sing
Go right ahead then
One little, two little, five little Indian
Five little Indian boys!
You skipped two Indians
I said five
didn't you hear it?
Are you mad?
Yes, so what?
Get out of here
You're really mad?
Go home
You think I like to stay here?
You get the medicine ready then
Don't use
too much water
Tie him up
What are you doing to him?
We'll bring you to the Captain
I'm not leaving here
We'll kill you then
Now would you like that?
Kill me then
Kill him
Don't kill him
Kill him
I can't do it
Are you disobeying Captain's order?
Yes
It's you again?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't you have
consciences?
Are we worse than two kids?
If he reports us to the government
we'll lose our lives
I couldn't care less about the treasures
I'd rather go find a job
We don't want to see Captain again
You tell him for us
Get out of here
as soon as possible
Take care of him for us
Don't you worry
How are you feeling?
I don't want to get you involved
I don't care
He does though
No
You've done
your nation a favor
Lieutenant
Take care of yourselves
We've done our nation a favor
We should keep on doing more
So you teamed up with outsiders
They're innocent
He's innocent
Why?
How do you feel?
What do you think?
It hurts
Hand over the pieces
You must be kidding
Every Chinese owns
a share of the treasures
I don't represent them all
Nor do I
Where are the pieces?
I don't know. Let's stall him
We will never
let you know
I shouldn't be wasting time on you then
I'm hit
Are you all right?
Why don't we tell
him the truth?
He won't believe us now
Be tough
We're doing all Chinese a favor
Will they come to our rescue?
Let's go
get some help
Let's go
You're walking out on your father?
Father?
Father?
That's my father
Thank God then
What did you say?
Nothing
Father
Uncle Wang. Cowboy!
Are you all right, father?
You kill my father
Stay cool, Cowboy
He's not your father
Your father's alive, Cowboy
Cowboy
Cowboy, Cowboy!
Cowboy
And I'll let you go
What about the Wangs?
I'll let them go too
You promise?
Dragon
Let's not stay here
I don't want him to know
I don't know
where the pieces are
I don't care
if you don't let me go
Tough kid
Speak up or I'll let go
Dragon
Cowboy
Cowboy
Are you all right?
Cowboy
Don't let him go
He threw my father down
Do the same to him
I can't beat him
He's neither taller
nor stronger than you
Why can't you beat him?
Let's leave here
What would you do
if that was your father?
Uncle Wang
Dragon
I'll kill the bastard
That's what I'm going to do
Cowboy
Get out of here
Speak up
and I'll let you go
Are you afraid of anything?
I'm not
even afraid of death
We'll die together
Together
I'll drag you down
Cowboy, he's coming down the belt
Excuse me, Dragon
Do you think we killed him?
All I know is we're still alive
I'd better go to my father
Are you all right, father?
Should I throw him down again?
Dragon
You go first. Hurry...
- Quick.
- What takes you so long?
Where's Uncle Wang?
He's being with the officers.
Will catch up us later
Dragon, he takes
all our credit
He's your father
Have you discussed how to do that?
How? Use hands, of course
Then we've to be quick or nothing left
One, two, one... One, two, one...
Trembling with rage while it rains
I roar with pain, the emotion is strong
How much have I contributed
and how long have I traveled?
I mustn't wait any longer
And leave regrets
The vengeance must be taken
But when?
Leading my troops to crush the enemies
Drinking their blood and eating their flesh
We must regain our land and
revive our spirit
One, two, one, two
Please be seated
Please, please
All the best
Thanks
It's taller this year
Don't mess around
It's taller than your barn
Go get the ball
The ball is ours
We're invincible
To beat us impossible
I get it
We're on the same side
What?
Are you color-blind?
Okay? Come on
It's yours
I'm a red
Get away
No, you were running the wrong pattern
That's not ours. Don't put it in
Ours is red
I confuse
Catch it
Dragon
Don't let him get near the table
Catch! Dragon
Here!
I get the prize
