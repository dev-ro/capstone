PM Narendra Modi. This film is a dramatic
conversion inspired by the life of..
..India's respectable Prime
Minister Shri. Narendrabhai Modi.
Through this film, we intend to evoke..
..love and nationalism in the hearts of
youth and citizen of this great nation.
While portraying Modiji's
life with complete..
..grandeur and dignity we've
taken some artistic liberty.
We're presented some incidences
of his life in fictitious ways.
Also presented
some fictitious characters.
References are taken
from public sectors..
..including his biographies,
radio, television..
..and articles published in
the newspapers and Magazines.
And his interviews.
These references are certified..
..by the Honoured news
advisors Siddharth Chhaya..
..Sudhir S. Rawal and Kana Vandhawa.
This film's doesn't
claim to endorse the..
..historical truth of any of the actor..
..and it's character names,
series of events..
..languages or costumes shown.
We don't intend to disrespect or insult
any person or community's trust..
..or emotion, religion or nationhood.
This story is not of a man..
..but of a country.
India.
In 2013.
This country had to take a decision..
..to either create a history..
..or become the history.
And there was a man
standing on the crossroad.
India is waiting for one decision.
Will BJP declare Narendra Modi
as it's PM candidate or not?
News even stirred
the ruling party camp.
A leap from CM to PM?
Is it a joke?
They've many seniors in the party.
He stands no chance.
First of all,
he won't get the nomination.
Godhra case is already hounding him.
What's your opinion?
I'm not a politician like you, madam.
But I'd like to say one thing
to your party workers.
I've been observing
this man from past 30 years.
Looking at his background.
And his working style.
He can reach any height.
Madam.
BJP has announced its candidate.
Modi.
BJP has confirmed Narendra Modi
as its PM candidate.
As you can see,
the nation is overjoyed.
Hey.. Modi. Modi.
He was loved by the
millions of people.
At the same time, not liked by some.
Why is everyone so tensed?
An ordinary tea-seller can
never become this country's PM.
He wants to come to Delhi. Let him come.
We will install a tea-stall outside..
..the parliament building
for him to sell tea.
Anyway, who's this Modi?
It was the decade of 1950.
A small village of Gujarat known as.
Vadnagar.
In his tender age he had realized..
..that progress lies
in speed and policy.
Everyone's choice, Modi's tea.
Have some tea, uncle.
Everyone's choice, Modi's tea.
Dad, this is today's income.
Hurry up, son.
You're getting late for the school.
Bye, I am going.
Listen, son.
Let's go, Raju.
He goes to school and works as well.
Sometimes he says such
meaningful things..
..that I feel..
..I am not his father..
..he is mine.
You too work as a house cleaner.
I cannot stop you either.
I don't like this.
Everything will be fine.
Naru, why do you always
salute at the flag?
Why do you always
bow down at the temple?
Let's go.
Speed up, more dishes are coming.
Naru!
Say Jai Hind again.
Stop troubling him.
Start eating.
Mom, a bread please.
I'll get it.
- Here.
- Mom, a bread please.
- Mom, water.
- Do you want?
Me, too.
You take it, son.
- Mom.
- Yes.
What do you want, Naru?
Hey, Naru.
I will do it, son.
Not you. Get up.
No, mom. Not you but
I will do the dishes at home.
You're very stubborn.
Sardar Patel had already warned..
..Nehru not to trust these Chinese.
Huh!
Look what happened.
Nehru didn't listen to Sardar
Patel in the Kashmir either.
We will soon be fighting
a war with Pakistan too.
You are right.
Let's see what happens in future.
Hello, brother.
What?
A long discussion over tea is fair..
..but education is
an expensive affair.
It's quite beneficial.
What do you mean?
You won't get it.
Next song is dedicated
to our brave soldiers..
..who are leaving
for the India-China war.
- I salute to..
- The motherland!
- I salute to..
- The motherland!
Narendra was raised with
the idealism of India.
And now he wanted to
make an ideal India.
'Don't be so heartless.
Try to understand.'
'They are married since childhood.'
'No.'
'Only after you give the dowry,
will they get married.'
'Who will marry me?'
'I will marry your daughter.' Go.
Go. Go!
I will not marry your daughter.
How heartless!
You're bargaining your own daughter!
And you..
You're promoting
a minor girl's marriage?
This dowry and child-marriage..
..are a curse
for every woman in India.
It's an insult of her dignity.
Listen to me.
Your parents gave you life.
But you've the sole right
to take your life's decisions.
We can never be a strong nation
as long as our women are helpless.
Because, in women power
lies the power of India.
Very well said!
But you should be a
leader and not an actor.
- By the way, I am..
- Mr. Laxmanrao Inamdar.
Alias 'Vakilbabu' (lawyer).
Indeed, you've all
the qualities of a leader.
No..
Well, the excitement
doubled after seeing you.
Narendra, I want you to joins us..
..as the publicists of RSS.
Don't you wish to serve the nation?
Yes, I wish to but...
There's a confusion.
Confusion?!
I've still not discovered myself.
Sometimes I wish to join Sangh..
..and sometimes,
army so as to serve the country.
And sometimes I just wish to..
..renounce everything and
live in Himalayas.
Narendra, some people
leave their decisions on fate.
Sometimes it's heads
and sometimes tail.
Only one in a million
shapes his fate..
..with his firm decision.
Fate or endeavours.
Choose any one.
Got two tickets.
- Wow!
- Let's go.
"I wish to relive
these moments today."
'I swear, I will never
introduce myself as a guide.'
'You please come back to the hotel.'
'Or else people will misunderstand..'
'..that I am roaming
with a drunk woman.'
'Raju.'
'A stone that invokes faith..'
'..is worshipped as God.'
'A place where you
experience divinity..'
'..is none less than a shrine.'
'A man who invokes
spirituality in you..'
'..is a great man.'
'Someone else decides..'
'..you are just a medium.'
'He does the work
and you get the credit.'
'Just keep chanting His name..'
'..and do the job
He has given to you.'
Aunt, one bread please.
Are you possessed
by Dev Anand now?
- No, I'm full.
- Just one bread.
Mom.
Yes.
I want to be a celibate.
Sometime, a soldier.
Then RSS publicist.
And now a celibate.
We will lose this boy.
- Now what?
- He needs to be bonded now.
17th of the next month
will be auspicious.
Why wait for a month?
Fix a date in this month.
Yes, of course.
As you wish.
What are you reading these days, son?
This is Gautam Buddha's biography.
What was his life story?
He was a king.
He had everything..
..yet he was upset.
One day, he set out
to discover himself.
Leaving behind his wife
and son alone.
He renounced everything.
He spent his entire
life in serving people..
..and finally attained
salvation (nirvana).
That's great!
Indeed. He was a great soul.
I want to follow him in my life.
Dad.
Dad, your blessings.
"Wandering in search.."
"Wandering in search.."
"yet remained unquenched."
"Like a moth, that's destined.."
"to burn down near a flame."
"Restlessly he just moves on."
"Restlessly he just moves on."
"And spends sleepless nights."
"Away from the worldly attachments."
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."
"After the continuous
journey over time.."
"After the continuous
journey over time.."
"now, tired of this
search for enlightenment."
"Controlled the sorrows
and happiness."
"Controlled the sorrows
and happiness.."
"and enjoying the detachment."
"This thirst is such.."
"This thirst is such.."
"that everything seems deceiving."
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."
- Will you have some tea?
- Yes.
Sage, I've renounced
my family and married life.
I've many questions on my mind.
I don't know my destination,
my goal in life.
What's the purpose of my life?
That's it. The mug..
It's full, right?
Similarly,
your mind is full of questions.
Let's put an end to it.
Henceforth, not you but
I will pose questions to you.
Hail river Ganges!
After 20 years of
rigourous austerity..
..if you're granted
with a divine power..
..by which you can walk
on the water and cross the river.
Or an ordinary boat..
..by which you can sail
thousands of people across the river.
What will you choose?
Sage, I..
I will choose the boat.
Was my answer correct?
I will tell you at the right time.
- Narendra.
- Yes.
- Pass that knife.
- Right away.
Sage, quite a few days passed..
..but you didn't ask any question.
Why?
I just asked you and you..
- Just now?
- Yes, and you replied.
I didn't understand.
But I did.
These are very old and huge trees.
But now they have decayed.
So, they need to be cut down.
Tell me one thing.
Now that you've cut down this tree,
what will be your next action?
Sage, now that I've
uprooted this tree..
..can I sow-in something else?
Yes, Narendra.
Sure.
Today you've discovered yourself.
Your life's purpose is down there.
Not here.
Meaning?
Recollect all the questioned
I posed to you in past 2 years..
..and your replies.
After 20 years of austerity,
the one who would learn..
..to walk on the water
is called 'yogi' (sage).
But in the same time, if somebody..
..would help and serve
thousands of people..
..then he is called 'Karma
Yogi' (sage by karma).
You handed me the knife
with the blade on your side.
It means when it comes to people,
you think selflessly.
As you have sown new seeds..
..in place of the decayed trees.
Even this society,
this entire country is decaying.
You must shape new India.
Always..
..keep grounded.
And aim for the skies.
This government's corruption..
..has taken a heavy toll of Gujarat.
We must continue with
this Nav Nirman movement.
Who will be the foundation
of this new Gujarat?
Narendra.
Vakilbabu.
Now, I don't need this coin.
I will shape my own future.
RSS is not just an
organisation but an army.
It will tirelessly
fight for the country.
Country's enemy will be our enemy.
My life is dedicated for United India.
It's not that easy.
You will have to work day and night.
These eyes have nurtured many
dreams for the country.
I am ready to sacrifice anything.
You will have to compromise
your comforts.
Hard work is my comfort.
Self service will be your motto.
Including the smallest jobs.
No work is big or small.
It's just the thinking.
You will have to
sacrifice your riches.
Nationalism is my property.
And the people of this
nation are my riches.
This head will held high
for the tricolour only.
And my voice will be
raised for the people only.
This is a very important
rally of our movement.
We will constantly build the pressure.
And make sure the
government is collapsed.
- Are you all ready?
- Ready.
Ready.
Good!
A bad news, Vakilbabu.
All our volunteers are arrested.
On the direct orders
from the CM office.
- We must cancel this rally.
- No.
There'll be no change in rally.
I want 1000 people.
Impossible.
It's difficult to bring together
100 people in present situation.
How will we gather so many?
And who will bring them?
I will..
Not just 1000..
..but 10,000.
You're too much.
Not even for the free meal do people..
..gather in this huge numbers.
Have you gone mad?
You're always ready
to take up the challenge.
Listen to me for just five minutes..
..and I promise your
bank balance will increase.
How?
Because your stolen
amount will return to you.
At least Rs.150 stolen from each.
Who stole our money?
Your chief minister Chintanbhai..
..and his government.
An ordinary family's
ration would cost Rs.12.
How much does it cost you now?
- Rs.32.
- Exactly.
That's where they theft Rs.20.
Who incurred loss in all this?
- We have.
- You have.
You didn't receive
appraisals from many years.
But school fees have hiked by Rs.30.
You work hard for your
children's education.
They are robbing your money..
..as well as your children's future.
Should we allow this to happen?
Not at all.
Should we allow this to happen?
Not at all.
I will not let them
infest the country.
Gujarat will see the reformation.
Say with me.
Victory to Valiant Gujarat!
Victory to Valiant Gujarat!
That year the movement was so intense..
..that the chief minister
was forced to resign.
Total loss of 30 crores,
madam Prime Minister.
I lost money but you lost
the government in Gujarat.
All because of him.
Who?
- Some Narendra..
- Narendra Damodardas Modi.
Remember his full name.
He has the capacity..
..to erase your complete identity.
- Yes, dad.
- Mr. Reddy.
Don't overreact.
He's just an ordinary volunteer.
Include his name in the list
of important opposition leaders.
We will see him.
In no time you termed him
a leader from a volunteer.
Swift promotion, isn't it?
Any information about?
As per the intelligence reports,
he's in Delhi these days.
Arrest him.
Sure, madam.
Give orders to the police
and the administration.
To impose emergency from tomorrow.
Police has arrested all our leaders.
- What?
- Yes.
More than one lakh
volunteers are arrested.
Without any court case.
That's why the government
has put a ban on the press.
We must do something big
to put an end to this emergency.
Narendra, get them out of here, quickly.
Police are here to arrest you.
Come fast. Hurry up.
Take him out quickly.
- Fast.
- Come on.
This way.
There's a way on the backside.
Come.
Oh, police.
Come here. Down.
Go that side.
- Raju, check that side.
- No use.
The Police have cordoned the area.
Remove this. come on.
There's no way to go out.
There's a way.
But you will have to die for this.
Sir, it seems they are somewhere here.
Search every house.
There's only a common
gate for entry and exit.
No one should escape.
Go this way.
'God is the ultimate truth!'
'God is the ultimate truth!'
'God is the ultimate truth!'
- Come behind me.
- 'God is the ultimate truth!'
'God is the ultimate truth!'
'God is the ultimate truth!'
'God is the ultimate truth!'
"Wide chest and doughty brain."
"He alone has stirred the world."
"He's master of tricks.
No one can bring him on his knees."
"His actions always
surprise everyone."
"Form the day one,
he had a vision.."
"to reform India."
"He's always energetic and inspiring."
"He will evoke nationalism in the citizens.
And prove India's skills."
"A word 'Namo'
will echo in the country."
"No one will be in race with 'Namo'."
Policeman's face was worth watching!
Yes, we brought him out safe..
..right in front of
the entire police force.
Don't laugh. We haven't finished.
This is just the beginning.
We must bring forth our
point to the international media.
So that the world would
raise eyebrows at this emergency.
But how do we reach
the international media?
International conference.
Have you gone mad?
Police will be flocked over there.
Along with the media and
leaders from all over the world.
But how do we reach there?
I will take you there.
Do you trust me?
"A word 'Namo' will echo in the country.
No one will be in race with 'Namo'."
"He's master of tricks. No one can bring him on his knees."
- Stop him!
"His actions always surprise everyone."
"Form the day one,
he had a vision.."
- "..to reform India."
- Pull the barricades quickly.
"He's always energetic
and inspiring."
"He will evoke nationalism
in the citizens."
"And prove India's skills."
"The wounds are fresh."
"Live a little."
- Hey.
- "Why shed tears?"
How come so many 'sardars'
(Punjabi) have joined all of a sudden?
"The wounds are fresh."
"Live a little."
"Why shed tears?"
Sir, there are many 'sardars'.
Which one I should arrest?
Arrest everyone.
'Whoever utters thy name...'
'... shall triumph.'
- "He moves forward fearlessly."
- Move.. move..
Stop. Stop.
Stop I say. Stop.
Stop I say. Stop.
Even if we reach there,
how do we enter inside?
Police will be guarding every door.
Yes, but not every policeman..
..will be in their favour.
"He is an example,
a tea-seller leading the country."
"He never turned back to see."
"Do what you can."
"His only dream is to take
India on number one position."
"His speeches and eyes
reflect his aggression."
"That's why millions
of people are in his support."
You can neither suppress
our freedom nor our voice.
All of you, the world leaders.
Shame on you, for your silence.
You claim to protect democracy?
But instead you protect
her dictatorship.
What are you doing?
Come on. Arrest them.
A hole is enough for a boat to sink.
That was an end of emergency.
So was it for..
..the congress government
as it collapsed..
..for the first time
in the independent India.
And in 1980..
..a revolutionary thought
came into existence..
Known as BJP.
Idea is really good.
But what's the purpose of..
..this 'Rath Yatra'
(Religious procession)?
I'm not against any religion.
But is it wrong to take
proud of our own religion?
Not at all.
The only purpose is to
bring all the Hindus together.
And give them a slogan.
'Say with pride we are Hindus.'
From Somnath to Ayodhya.
How will our party
be able to organize..
..this huge rally?
Who will do all this?
There's one person.
He alone can handle everything.
'Rath Yatra' instilled..
..feeling of Hinduism in India.
People came in support of BJP..
..from every region of the country.
Narendra.
You've done wonders.
Hindus from all over
the country have joined us.
What are you thinking, son?
13.5 crores.
10 crores of Muslim,
2 crores of Christian.
And 1.5 crores of Sikhs.
Till date, we couldn't connect with
all of them.
So, what should we do?
National Integration
Rally for united India.
Unified India.
- United India.
- Unified India.
- United India.
- Unified India.
- United India.
- Unified India.
- United India.
- Unified India.
United India.
We will not let India divide.
We will not.
Earlier they wanted Khalistan.
Now, they want Kashmir
and form another Pakistan.
Surrendering at terror today..
..means losing our brave
soldiers in future.
We are 86 crores.
Together we will
protect this tricolor flag.
The tricolor flag shall flutter
in every corner of our country.
India shall no longer fear terrorism..
..but terrorism shall fear India.
National integration
rally reached Kashmir.
What's your opinion on this?
So who's responsible?
Why do they ignite fire in Kashmir?
Terrorists have lit Kashmir.
Every day they are demolishing
temples in Kashmir.
Millions of local Kashmiri Pundits..
..became refuge in their own country.
Talks can resolve any issue.
I will talk to Nawaz Sharif.
Talks are going on from past 44 years.
Stubborn people don't listen..
..till they have
a very good thrashing.
Give a stern warning to Pakistan.
Vacate Kashmir, or face our wrath.
Do they want one
more war with Pakistan?
I am the PM. I will handle everything.
Although he's PM..
..he can't buy a piece
of land in his own Kashmir.
Section 370 must be removed.
They are playing with
Kashmiri's emotions..
..in the name of section 370.
Now, it's the question
of India's emotions..
..and not of the Kashmir alone.
One nation,
one law, one tricolour flag.
This press conference backfired on us.
Sir, we must stop them.
They are breaching the laws.
Order their arrest.
He's arrested, sir.
You arrested him..
..for he unfurled the
Tricolour flag and called for unity.
Okay, set him free.
Let him go to the Lal Chowk.
And get shot by the terrorists.
You've already made him a hero.
Now, don't make a mistake
of proving him martyr.
So, what should I do?
He shouldn't be arrested?
Provide security and escort him?!
You must be proud of this uniform.
Proud as well as pained.
Pain?
We kill the terrorists.
But we can't even
touch these politicians..
..and separatists who shelter them.
We lay our life for
the nation with a smile.
But when our people
throw stones at us..
..its really heartbreaking.
I salute your courage and patience.
I've only one desire.
To see a real man
as our Prime Minister.
The day he empowers us..
..we will finish off these rogues.
Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!
They've either run away
or hiding somewhere nearby.
Luckily no life is lost.
You please return.
No.
I will not.
This isn't a civilian's job.
We are the army personals.
We are trained to embrace death.
The only difference
between us is this uniform.
This is the Lal Chowk.
Right here,
they swear on dividing India.
And openly set our
tricolor flag on fire.
I don't care if I lose my life..
..but I will flutter
the tricolor flag.
Glory to Mother India!
Under the leadership
of Murli Manohar Joshi..
..the National integration
rally organized by Narendra Modi..
..promoted the integrality
of this country.
As a result, Narendra Modi
was given charge of..
..election campaign for 1995,
Gujarat election.
Hail Lord Shiva!
Very good!
Last time you had come
to collapse the government.
And now you've come
to form the government.
Very good.
But it's a tough job, son.
Ever since independence,
no one could..
..uproot congress from Gujarat.
What are you saying, Vakilbabu?
You've eased many
impossible things.
Yes, because Narendra was with me.
Who do you have?
I'm looking for someone
who can consider..
..the party his family and
whose only motto is to serve people.
You can't look for such a person.
You need to identify him.
Tell me your problem.
Sir, arrangements are done for
a free medical camp in our village.
But we couldn't find a doctor as yet.
Should I need to
find a doctor for you?
Number 8.
He isn't a number or a figure.
He's Mr. Anil.
The dedicated party worker.
But Mota bhai, for the election..
These workers' services will
help us win the election.
These volunteers nurture the party.
Learn to respect these volunteers.
You've to identify them. Yes.
- Narendra Modi.
- I know.
Super hit pairs are matchless.
Like Tendulkar and Sehwag.
Or Jay and Veeru.
One such pair was formed.
Excuse me.
Stop.
Can we get some water please?
Hey, what are you doing?
You should not waste water.
We walk 4 miles
under this scorching heat..
..just to get 2 pots of
water for the entire family.
Sorry, sister.
But Naru,
why are we going to see Atulbhai?
He didn't win the last election.
Yes.
What yes?
Instead of the winning members..
..we are going to meet the loser.
Because more than a winner..
..a loser knows
the value of victory..
Wow, Atulbhai,
when did you win this trophy?
In last year's cricket tournament..
..I won the title of man of the match.
I see.
Atulbhai is not just a sportsman..
..but he has immense
knowledge of cricket.
- Really?
- Yes.
No, it's just like that.
Okay, tell me who will
win the world cup this time?
India will.. I am confident.
This time our team is very strong.
Who had won the world cup in 1992?
In 1992.
- Pakistan.
- Yes.
And who was the runner up?
Runner up?
Leave it, Narendrabhai.
No one remembers the losers.
Exactly my point.
You lost the last election
by how many votes?
9406 votes, right?
Would you like to be the
man of the match in a big game?
Narendrabhai, I am with you.
But I've no money to
invest in the election.
Atul, election is won by the people,
not by the money.
Narendrabhai,
I will also join hands with you.
But how do we win
election without money?
I've a magical wand.
What are you saying, Narendrabhai?
Magic to win election?
Please share with us.
I will share it at 7 AM..
..tomorrow at 'Kala Dungar'.
Where's Narendrabhai?
And where's his magic?
Let's go.
Hello, Atulbhai.
This is the magic of winning election.
It's called work.
From generations, women walk
miles and miles to collect water.
I thought I should
bring water to them now.
I am making a canal.
What are you saying, Narendrabhai?
Bringing water from
the distance of 4 miles..
..will take a year
digging up alone like this.
Who said that I am alone?
Sister, your life spent
in collecting water.
Don't let that happen
with these girls.
They should be in school.
Am I right?
Come on. - Pass that to me.
Take it from there.
Yes, come on.
- But Narendrabhai.
- Yes.
This is Government's job.
Yes, but if we will
do the government's jobs..
..then we will form
the next government.
We won't ask for the votes.
We will do the work. Votes will follow.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
"I take oath upon this soil."
"I will not let this country to diminish."
"I will not let this country to diminish."
"I will not let the country bow."
"I take oath upon this soil."
"I will not let this country to diminish."
"I will not let this country to diminish."
"My motherland asks me when
you would repay your debts to me."
"My skies ask me when
you would fulfill your duty."
- Narendrbhai.
- Yes.
Even they wish to build
a canal in their village.
Sure.
Okay, start working as of now.
"I've promised my mother India."
"I won't let the blaze to be faded."
"I take oath upon this soil."
"I will not let this country to diminish."
"I will not let this country to diminish."
"I will not let the country bow."
This time Narendrabhai
has really worked hard..
..Karsanbhai.
You'll surely become the CM this time.
Stop dreaming.
I think we will have
to go into farming again.
More than 200 people
have come to cast votes..
..for the opposition
party since this morning.
Not even 20 have come
to cast votes for us.
I told you, no
one can win election without money.
But you all ignored it.
Karsanbhai,
victory is enjoyed all the more..
..when people expect your defeat.
Votes will come automatically.
Vote for the name I suggest.
Here are sarees for you
and dress for your husband.
Get away. We don't want all this.
We've come for Narendrabhai.
Narendrabhai.
We will vote for the name you suggest.
Till date women have
suffered the most.
But you brought water to our village.
Should we vote for Lotus?
Just one step is needed for the
journey of thousands of miles.
BJP took that first step in Gujarat.
First time Lotus won
in the desert regions.
And BJP formed government in Gujarat.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
First of all, I want to
thank you for coming here.
Tell me.
You know my father
had built this stadium.
I've seen nine CM in
Gujarat in past 35 years.
You're the tenth one.
Don't worry about the funding.
You will get it on time.
May it be for the party..
..or personal.
Just make sure that
our files get a go ahead.
Should I discuss all this
with you or with Narendra Modi?
Why him?
I'm the CM. Who is he?
The one who made your
way to the chair of CM.
People say this.
That you're CM and he's super CM.
My MLAs and I feel..
..that two CMs can't occupy one chair.
You want to kick him off who
Got you elected?
Think again.
Can you afford to lose
one man or break the party?
Look..
Come.. come, Narendra.
In the interest of the party,
I want you..
..to go to Delhi
and take up new responsibilities.
Yes, Narendra. Karasanbhai
will handle everything over here.
You want me to leave Gujarat.
You know better than me.
The most suitable place for me.
This is absolutely wrong.
What will you do now?
Work.
Quick. Quick!
Doctor! Take him to
the medical camp. Quick.
Hey, hurry up.
Hello.
I know you're ordered
not to come to Gujarat.
But the motherland is above all.
And Gujarat needs you.
You will have to come here.
Yes.
Yes.
Right now?
Take this. How are you now?
Narendrabhai.
Yes.
They want you in Gandhinagar.
Right now.
Narendrabhai,
you had to go against party orders..
..and come here for my sake.
No.
For the sake of Gujarat.
Narendra.
In past five years..
..we've noticed your selfless
service to the party.
Delhi, Himachal Pradesh.
And Haryana.
Now, we need you in Gujarat.
So, we want you to be the CM.
You know better than me.
The most suitable place for me.
Narendrabhai, please consider it.
Aditya Vardhan Reddy.
Earlier you were
with that party, right?
That was in past.
At present you are in power.
Where there's power, there we are.
By the way, what are you into?
Business or politics?
I am in the business of politics.
CM will come soon.
I want to see him in private.
From more than 2 hours VVIPs..
..of the country are waiting for you.
And CM sir is busy with the public.
For your knowledge..
..my party name is Bhartiya
Janta Party. (Indian people's party).
Look, sir.
I'm a man of the numbers.
From past 40 years,
I've witnessed 13 CM in Gujarat.
You're the 14th one.
Just that your co-operation and..
..my business should
go on uninterruptedly.
Party will be funded nonstop.
And obviously, to you as well.
You're running 14
companies in Gujarat.
3 are running upto the standard.
But 11 are not.
Mr. Reddy,
you're making ample of money.
But now the watchman is here.
You like the figures, right?
Eleven.
I will shut down your
11 companies in next 11 days.
Okay, let's talk openly.
What do you want?
They don't expect anything
who love the nation.
Each and every thing
comes with a price.
May it be in the market
or in the government.
This government will shut your market.
I will let the business
prosper in Gujarat.
But will not sale
Gujarat ever in life.
My Gujarat is not for sale.
Jai Hind!
You were right, dad.
I must remember his full name.
Narendra Damodardas Modi.
I will demolish your government.
Just a spark is enough
to light up the fire.
Humanity was lost.
On that day, when people
forgot brotherhood.
Sir 69 Hindus are burnt
alive in Sabarmati express.
Riots broke in Gujarat, sir.
- Did you take your books?
- Listen to your mom.
Yes, mom.
Okay, say goodbye to mom?
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.
- You're very small, son.
- Hello.
Come.
Baby, here comes your friend.
Okay, Salimbhai.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Bye, dad.
Breaking news.
After Sabarmati express
was set on fire..
..Hindus have taken up the weapons.
Riots broke in the entire state.
Are you alright, brother?
Hail Lord Rama!
Hail Lord Rama!
Hail Lord Rama!
Hail Lord Rama!
Hail Lord Rama!
Hail Lord Rama!
Thank you, God!
Gujarat needs your help.
Send the rapid action
forces quickly. Yes.
I had asked for the reserved
forces from Maharashtra's CM.
What's the update?
I'm following up since
this morning but no response.
They are doing politics
even in this situation?
Call up the DG.
Yes.
When will the police from
Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh arrive?
No response from both the states.
- Joshi.
- Yes.
Make me talk to the chief
ministers of both the states again.
- Yes.
- I will request them again.
Okay.
Our police force?
Sir, the entire police
force is deployed.
I will personally
visit the affected areas.
"Lord Rama, the Lord of heavens."
"Blessed is thy name."
Whether the other states'
police help us or not.
Whether the paramilitary
forces reach here or not.
We will stop these riots.
We will stop it.
Impose curfew in the entire state.
Send every rioter behind bars.
My Gujarat is burning.
The Gujarat government has setup
Relief camps everywhere
The number of casualties
has reached 1000.
This is an opportunity
to collapse Modi's government.
Narendra Modi has..
- ..requested the government to remain calm.
- Don't miss it.
Sure, sir.
Police are arresting
rioters on the spot.
People want to know.
Why CM of Gujarat
has blindfolded his eyes?
For the first time riots
are under control within 24 hours.
Actually, Gujarat Police
didn't take action.
Modiji didn't want
police to take action.
If what you say is correct..
..then Modiji wouldn't
ask for the police force..
..from the neighbouring states.
Unfortunately,
he didn't get any help from them.
Because, your party was in power..
..in all the neighbouring states.
Your news channel didn't
throw any light on this.
Anyway, tell me where's
your chief minister right now?
What's he doing?
Gujarat government has put
up relief camps at many places.
1000 died and more
than 2500 are injured.
Narendra Modi has appealed
people to maintain peace.
Curfew is still imposed
in many parts of the state.
Rioters are being
arrested on the spot.
We are managing somehow.
We will need more doctors
and medical teams.
Hello.
Force has reached.
Riots are under control.
1044 are dead.
790 Muslims and 254 Hindus, sir.
- Number of injured are..
- Enough.
How long will you divide them?
Spare them after the death.
No Hindus and no Muslims.
1044 Gujaratis are dead.
My people died.
Sorry, sir.
No.
My son.
My small child.
My son.
Return my child to me.
Return my child to me.
My child.
My child.
I can't change what has happened.
But I promise you.
As long as I am alive..
..I will not let the
riots break again in Gujarat.
Sir, opposition says
that he's behind the riots.
Now, he's just doing a
charade to control the situation.
You're secular, sir.
How did this happen in your presence?
This incidence is
a stigma on our nation.
There should be no discrimination..
..in the name of religion or caste.
I've said the same thing to Narendra.
He should follow his duty.
And that's what he has done.
But that will be possible..
..only when Narendra Modi will resign.
This party is my family.
And I regard you like my father.
I can't tolerate if a
finger is pointed at you..
..because of me.
Resignation.
This is injustice with Narendra.
Within six months
of his rule as a CM..
..Godhra incidence happened.
Why?
The riots broke out of the rage
as the train bogie was set afire.
Narendra had arrested..
..25 thousand people
and controlled the riots.
You know this is
oppositions' conspiracy..
..to collapse our government.
You're right.
I will never let this happen.
Narendra Modi continues
to be the CM of Gujarat.
Resignation was just a charade.
And it is clear..
Salutations, brother Masood.
Hello.
This isn't good.
700 Muslims are killed in Gujarat.
It's good for us.
700 died.
Now 7000 Jihadis will
be born for Jaish-e-Mohammad.
This is the right chance to
turn Gujarat into another Kashmir.
Are your boys ready?
Target?
Hello.
Chief minister office!
Terrorists have entered Akshardham.
Many are caught up here.
We need help.
- Try to understand..
- Sir, please don't go inside.
The people want to know.
What's going on in Gujarat?
No. No. No.
What has happened?
They suddenly entered and opened fire.
By the grace of God, we came out safe.
As you heard,
many people are still trapped inside.
Let's see what steps Gujarat CM..
..Narendra Modi takes
to bring them out safe.
Sources say..
..there are two terrorists inside.
Thankfully, NSG team is here.
First and most important point.
Bring out the trapped devotees safely.
Sir, you're standing here all night.
Take some rest.
Joshi, will the families
of trapped ones be able to rest?
Sir, mission successful.
Target eliminated.
My mother is inside.
I'm trying to contact her but..
I want to know about
my son Vikas, please.
Run.
Please call my husband.
Hey.. Vikas.
Where is the doctor?
- No. - Swami.
- No, son.
Everything will be alright.
Both the terrorists were Muslims.
Godhra like situation is created
in Gujarat after this news.
Riots can break in Gujarat again.
Almighty.
20 dead bodies are
recovered from Akshardham.
I hope once again..
- More than 70 are injured.
No.. no..
Swami.
- Are you alright?
- Everything will be fine.
Sir.
Sir, there's a big problem.
Sir, some irresponsible
media have publicized news..
..about terrorist's religion.
Once again, the situation like
Godhra can erupt in all over Gujarat.
No, I won't let that happen.
Talk to the state's police.
Talk to the paramilitary.
Talk to the reserved forces. Go.
Yes, sir.
Talk to the public.
Sir. Sir.
Sir, please tell us.
Sir, we heard riots can breakout..
..because of this terrorist attack.
Are you all saying this?
Not because of the terrorists.
But because of you all.
Because of all of us.
How long we will divide
in the name of religion and caste?
How long?
They are dividing us.
But we are breaking
the country into pieces.
First British divided us.
I am Hindu. You're Muslim.
He's 'Dalit' and he's 'Yadav'.
Some are Sikh and
some are south Indians.
With this strategy they
ruled over us for 300 years.
But we didn't learn anything.
What I regret is that
Hindustan is formed..
..but we couldn't be
the Hindustani by heart.
We still introduce ourselves
as Hindu and Muslim.
Listen to me carefully.
Today, if you take
up the weapon in hand..
..it will clearly mean that you are
not fighting for your religion..
..but for Pakistan.
This is exactly what they want.
Remember this.
This is my warning to Pakistan.
If ever they dare attack on us again..
..I will destroy them completely.
They've seen our sacrifices.
Now, they will see our revenge.
Azhar sir.
Both your boys are gunned down.
Sir, you kept your promise.
Entire Gujarat is with you.
I salute you.
I salute you.
Narendra Modi was
known as parachute CM..
..but now he's known as People's CM.
The way he has handled
the Akshardham's incidence..
..and his work in the direction
of development of Gujarat..
..have helped him receive
immense love from people.
Hello.
Tell me one thing.
Does your CM work for
minorities development as well?
No.
Do you feel safe in Gujarat?
Modi!
Modi!
Modi!
Modi!
Look, you misunderstand.
I... I... I didn't mean that.
What... what is this...
Let's go.
Hold this.
Sir, there's a problem.
Tell me quickly.
Sir, I thought they
will speak against Modi.
But they are all talking
in favour of Modi.
Just edit it off.
- Sir, it was live.
- What?
Sometimes I feel you're a
big waste of my time and money.
I am..
I am so sorry to have
kept you waiting so long.
Sir, I want your help.
Modi has stopped all our projects..
..in Gujarat from past 2 years.
Moreover, he has started
investigation on the land deal.
You will have to intervene.
Sir, land issues are handled
by the state government.
We can't help in this matter.
Sir, you're government of India.
You can put pressure
on Gujarat government.
If media comes to know..
..it will land us in trouble.
Sir, my partners and
I've invested a huge amount.
You..
You please find some solution.
Sir the..
Your father was a great man.
- He used to prove his words.
- Yes.
Modi has a problem with you.
But now that problem
is taking toll from us.
Give me little more time.
One week.
After that, you're out.
Yes, sir.
Kunal, do whatever you have to do.
Use as many cash as you want.
But that file must
clear in just one week.
Do you understand?
I will meet the minister today.
Minister.
Do my job in this week only.
Yes, it will be done. Don't worry.
And Modi?
This is my department.
Modi will not even get a hint.
By the way, I hope it's full 5 lakh.
- Yes, sir.
- You see, 5 is my lucky number.
Shake hands.
"Beat the drums,
I want to dance on it's tunes."
"Drummer.."
"Drummer.."
- Hey.
- Yes.
Why did you stop in
the middle of the road?
Have you gone mad?
Sir, call for you.
For me?
Who's it?
CM sir.
Reach my office. I want to talk.
Will reach in an hour.
Why one hour?
You just left from Redfox hotel.
It's just five minutes
away from my office.
And yes.
Also bring that bag along with you.
The one you took it in the hotel.
Yes. Yes, okay.
I was..
I was collecting
it for the party fund.
Really?
But he has something else to say.
Sir, I..
I am a businessman, sir. And I..
I don't want to see
you in my Gujarat again.
Or else I will send you behind bars.
You should be ashamed.
Such a long political career.
Your name, family's prestige.
Is this how you value them?
One..
Just give me one chance.
First and last chance.
Pick up the bag.
No.
Pick up the bag.
Distribute this cash amongst
the families of martyred..
..hailed from Guajrat.
On behalf of the state.
I want to see the receipt.
Ramji.
Neither will I accept any bribe..
..nor will I let others accept it.
What are you doing?
It's just 7 AM.
Rather, it's 5:30 AM.
I've to reach office.
So early?
Are you mad?
Yes, I am.
Modi has turned me mad.
He neither accepts bribe,
nor does he allow others.
Similarly, he doesn't even
allow us to sleep at night.
- Chairs.
- Not available, sir.
Not available?
People elected us. Not to sit idle.
But to get back to work.
Be a CM, for the CM.
Common man.
Gujarat Development Model.
Running a government is..
..nothing different than making tea.
Take little water.
Add tea powder to it.
Allow it to boil on a low flame.
Never, be in a hurry.
It can spoil your efforts.
Add little milk now.
Don't add too much.
Or else you will feel bloated.
Make sure your work
is noticed not your belly.
Add sugar. Very little.
I will not have
anything sweet in taste.
Nor will I let others have it.
Ginger.
Keeps your brain fit.
I just can't tolerate laziness.
Cardamom.
Helps fight indigestion.
No upset stomach.
No wicked intentions.
Now, stir slowly with a ladle.
Without making noise.
Your output should
be more, not noisy.
There you go.
Modi special tea is ready.
Will you eat?
No.
- Take it.
- I'm fasting, starting today.
- Ramji.
- Yes.
Come.
Please, start.
What are you doing?
You're elected to
serve and not to enjoy.
Sureshbhai.
Start.
Serving them.
Take it.
All of you, please come in.
Sir.
In 36 years of my service..
..I've never received such respect.
Get used to it.
Because this is New Gujarat.
"A word 'Namo'
will echo in the country."
"No one will be in race with 'Namo'."
"Form the day one,
he had a vision to reform India."
"He's always energetic
and inspiring."
"He will evoke nationalism
in the citizens."
"And prove India's skills."
"The wounds are fresh."
"Live a little."
"Why shed tears?"
As per your instructions,
your meeting is fixed..
..with all the top
companies of America..
..and NRI organizations.
Sir, what's your investment
target for Gujarat?
45,000 crores.
Sir, that's too big.
I think it's impossible.
We will have to make it possible.
Every year after graduation,
youth of Gujarat..
..receives nothing
but the disappointment.
There's no employment.
Investment will boost
the infrastructure sector..
..which in turn will
generate employment.
I will personally meet
the major CEO of America..
..and request them to come to Gujarat.
Yes, Joshi.
Sir.
Go ahead, Joshi.
Sir, everyone's visas are received.
Good.
But one person's visa is cancelled.
And who's he?
You.
I'm sure central government
is behind this.
Also, media got the news before us.
Without you..
..we will not be able to
pull investments in Gujarat.
There's no point in going
to America without you.
- I think.. should we cancel the trip?
- No.
Whether I get the visa or not..
..I will definitely reach America.
Just as you asked, Mr. Reddy.
We denied Modi's Visa.
So then why all these organizers booking
halls and stadiums all across the US?
We are not certain.
But one thing we are certain of.
Mr. Modi will never set for America.
You kicked me out of Gujarat, Modi.
I will not let you
step out of Gujarat.
Modi! Modi!
Modi! Modi!
Modi! Modi!
Modi! Modi!
Jai Hind!
Indian may settle
anywhere in the world.
But we live in each other's heart.
I don't need any
visa to reach you all.
I'm really happy
watching your progress.
I feel proud.
Our NRI. And NRG of our Gujarat.
Now, you must be the
energy of New Gujarat.
And yes.
I promise.
I will welcome you with red carpet.
Not with red tape.
With co-operation,
not with corruption.
I request you all.
Do come to Gujarat Vibrant Summit.
Get connected.
Form a chain.
Together we've to make a new Gujarat,
New India.
Modi! Modi!
Modi! Modi!
You may be living in
any country of the world.
But this is your country.
Hindustan.
Modi! Modi!
Modi! Modi!
How many did they say?
Two hundred seventy thousand..
..Indians across 14 states?
Man, this guy is popular.
Hope I didn't make the
mistake denying him a visa.
- Joshi.
- Yes.
How's the response for the summit?
Response is just amazing, sir.
NRI investors have queued up.
But sir, after your video conference..
..with all the major
America companies' CEO.
Yes.
I've taken a follow up.
Yes, so?
But not a single
positive response, sir.
Their confidence
will build in Gujarat..
..only after the top Indian
company invests here.
And who will invest?
'Tata workers are still
fearful and intimidated..'
'..which has forced Ratan Tata..'
'..to take that crucial decision..'
'..of suspending work at the Singur..'
'..plant for the NANO project.'
We need to invest something
to bring the investment.
What's that, sir?
One rupee.
You mean CM himself
sent you a message?
Personal message?
Yes.
Normally,
these politicians make us go around..
..their secretaries and officers.
Yes, but this Modi is different.
I was watching his
TV interview yesterday.
And he said something
very interesting.
He said, government has
no business to be in business.
Seems progressive.
Seems pro-active. Don't you think so?
Sir, he may be different
but system is same in India.
Slow and corrupt.
We will stuck up between
permission and procedure.
One should never do business in India.
Let's move abroad.
Gupta, let me make
one thing very clear.
TATA hasn't made India.
India has made TATA.
Sorry, sir. but I think
this trip is a waste of time.
His one word said everything.
And I'd like to listen to him.
Welcome.
- Welcome to Gujarat, sir.
- Thank you.
Modiji is waiting for you.
So, are we directly
going to the CM office?
No.
Okay.
Quite strange.
Why did he arrange our meeting here?
He's the CM of the state.
He can arrange meeting
anywhere he wishes to.
Hello, Modiji.
Jai Hind!
Let's directly come to the point.
Your time is precious.
So is yours.
He's Gupta. The project head.
Gupta, go ahead.
Sir. Honestly this
project is very big.
And we want at least 500
acres of land at one place.
As you know land acquisition
is a big issue in India.
How much time it will take
for us to get 500 acres of land?
One second.
Meaning?
You're standing on
that plot right now.
But yes, it's not 500 acres.
It's 11000 acres altogether.
Because I always
think about the maximum.
That's great.
But we've to complete 28 compliances.
Based on my experience, to complete..
..all these permissions
and procedures..
- ..it will take about 8 months..
- Mr. Gupta,
What do you do?
I'm a project head.
No, what do you do?
TATA motors!
We make cars.
So you do your job.
Let the government do his.
Joshi.
File.
Not just 28, these are 29 permissions.
All of them are complete.
You can start your work from tomorrow.
Modiji, why did you
invite me to Gujarat?
For the 20000 families.
Employment.
Empowerment through employment.
If you come here,
I will make this region..
..the number one
automobile hub of India.
From 20,000 to 20 lakh employment.
That's my target.
I must say I am impressed, Modiji.
But I need some time to think.
Decision not taken in
a minute is never a decision.
15 seconds are still to go.
Mr. Modi,
we came with little expectations.
But you gave us everything
ready in a plate.
Thank you.
You were right, sir.
Not just the American companies..
..but the top companies
across the world..
..have queued up after
TATA came to Gujarat.
You've set a world record, sir.
And how is that?
Just one rupee's investment
on a text message.
And it pulled 75000
crores for Gujarat.
The world is one family.
Welcome to Gujarat.
Welcome to the vibrant Gujarat Summit.
We are native of Gujarat
and have come back to Gujarat.
Jamshedji Tata was born in Navsari.
And he had set up our
company from this very land.
I'm happy returning home.
And I want to thank you,
Modji for everything.
I also admire your positive attitude.
You didn't get American visa.
But in response, you brought
the entire world to Gujarat.
This isn't just the beginning for us..
..but for the New Gujarat.
Thank you, Modi.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Big success, huh!
Yes.
Every major American companies..
..and thousands of Americans are here.
To do business in Gujarat.
It's just the beginning.
Did you speak with him?
Can we meet after the summit?
No.
You're meeting him now.
Now?
On stage.
Congratulations, Mr. Modi.
This is truly a world class event.
Thank you.
I hope he didn't face
any problem getting the visa.
I am sorry.
I hope you had no
trouble getting the visa.
Smile.
As you can see, Narendra
Modi has won election with majority.
And has become the CM
of Gujarat for the fourth time.
Wait and watch for
his next action now.
Bless me, mom.
Bless you.
- Are you hungry?
- A lot.
This is nothing.
Once he had brought
home a baby crocodile.
- Really uncle?
- Yes.
- Crocodile?
- Yes.
Yes, and when I refused
to keep it at home..
..he took it to the school.
School? What happened after that?
Students as well as teachers
ran away from the school.
- That means no studies.
- Yes.
I still play with the crocodiles.
- What?
- Yes.
In politics.
That's true.
Gujarat's chief minister
is doing dishes in my kitchen?
I like to serve you like this.
You're mad.
- Give it to me.
- Here you are.
Mom.
Are you alright?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
What are you thinking about?
Party wants me to go to Delhi.
As PM candidate.
But mom, Delhi and
the politics over there..
..won't suit me.
I won't be able to fit there.
And there are many things
pending in Gujarat.
I think I will refuse.
You provided 24 hour
electricity in Gujarat.
Otherwise,
we were used to living in dark.
Son.
Country is covered with darkness.
People need some light.
You go.
You go to Delhi.
How did we lose on
these seats in Gujarat?
They were minorities dominated seats.
Yes, ma'am.
Now, even your ancestral
vote bank has joined him.
How's he doing it? I am confused.
Simple.
Modi has changed the
political formula of the game.
From divide and rule
to unite and rule.
I heard that now BJP is
planning to send him to Delhi.
To the parliament?
But we will not let this happen.
Do we have an option?
That Godhara case...
What's the name of that judge?
Modiji, please reply.
Modiji.
- Please reply.
- Modiji.
You're alleged
for communal riots in Godhra.
What will you say on this?
Truth always triumphs.
SIT interrogation
last for about 9 hours.
After 11 years of Godhra incidence,
it will be decided by SIT..
..if Narendra Modi was responsible
for Godhra incidence or not.
Good work on the SIT.
- Keep it up.
- Thank you, sir.
Now make such a move..
..that before SIT's judgment..
..public opinion would go against him.
Narendra deals with lives.
Yes.
He said that he still yields poison.
Other leaders..
- Man behind Godhra massacre.
- ..call him as Hitler.
Butcher of Godhra.
Lies after lies.
Series of lies.
How do we face these lies?
We will speak the truth.
- Joshi.
- Yes.
Call up Hemraj.
What?
Hello.
Modiji wants to give an interview.
When?
Today.
I will be there.
But on a condition.
- What?
- Interview will be live.
Live?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I was waiting for this opportunity.
Let's finish him.
SIT result can be
announced any moment.
And he's going to give interview.
That too, live.
Sir, you know him better than me.
If he decides once,
no one can stop him.
I will call you up as soon
as SIT result is out.
Tonight's Exclusive..
All of you will watch.
The end of Narendra Modi.
I will not beat around the bush.
So, let me ask you directly.
Why haven't you apologized
for Godhra incidence till date?
Bouncer on the very first ball.
Good one.
Only the criminals apologise.
And the law demands evidences.
If I've committed any crime,
then give me death penalty.
I accept.
If you're innocent..
..then how come your government were
mute spectacles when Gujarat was on fire?
Nanavati Commission
Reports clearly stated..
..it's neither mine
nor my Government's fault.
It is also mentioned
in the report that..
..setting afire 59 people
in Sabarmati Express..
..was not an accident
but a well thought plan.
But your channel
never aired this news.
Mr. Hemraj,
don't show fake arguments..
..and sell your news.
Public knows everything.
12 years passed.
12 years.
What's curfew?
What's riot?
None of the child in
Gujarat knows about it.
Who are the real culprits behind communal
riots after Godhra incidence.
Hindu or Muslim?
- Muslim.
- What did you say?
This is what you want
to hear from me, right?
For Muslims, Hindus are the culprit.
And for Hindus,
Muslims are the culprit.
But in my views,
both the communities..
..are culprit in terms of humanity.
Violence has no religion.
And no religion has violence.
Gujarat CM is with whom?
With poor or with businessmen?
With the progress.
World has praised Gujarat
Development Model.
But congress believes that your..
..Gujarat Development model is fake.
This is nothing but
the magic of your marketing.
I just do my work.
It's the central
government that does magic.
Black magic.
Everything has disappeared.
Country's money disappeared.
Employment disappeared.
Coal, electricity..
..and also the Prime
Minister's voice disappeared.
Friends, now you take your decision.
Do you wish to listen
to their tape record..
..or track record of my developments?
This isn't working.
Change the line.
Now, let's talk about the country.
- My next question is..
- Your question?
Or their question?
What do you mean?
Strange remote control technology.
You're asking questions
scripted by others.
Okay, go ahead.
It's heard that now you're
dreaming to be the PM.
Your oppositions say
that if Modi becomes the PM..
..one more Kargil war will happen.
If Modi becomes the PM..
..our relation with China
will spoil all the more.
If Modi becomes the PM..
..he will encourage Hinduism.
You repeatedly said
if Modi becomes PM.
It seems more than me you're
dreaming to see me as PM.
That's a masterstroke.
It's not a joke, Modiji.
People are really scared
that if you become the PM..
..we will be in one more
war with Pakistan and China.
You're going to provoke
the Kashmir issue..
..and the country will be divided.
Which party formed Pakistan?
Which party divided
the unified India in 1947?
Had Sardar Patel been
the PM in place of Nehru..
..we'd have neither
lost the war with China.
Nor Pakistan would have
had half of the Kashmir.
Nor our brave soldiers
would have been killed..
..on the border by
the hands of terrorists.
But, Modiji,
Hindustan is a secular country.
And people fear that you
will turn it into Hindu Nation.
Do you know the meaning of Hindustan?
Because Hinduism is not
just a religion but a thought.
Because of Hinduism,
the country is secular.
Because for us,
even a pundit is Hindu.
So is, human
who doesn't believe in idol-worship.
Not by the religion
but by the culture.
Hindustan is the only country where..
..Muslims pray on the road
and religious processions..
..of Hindus pass on the same road.
Secular countries like
France and Switzerland..
..have banned Hijab.
But not in India.
Only a Muslim can become
the President of Pakistan.
But in India, Abdul Kalam
had been the President once.
This is called Hindustan.
Here, one thing is above the religion.
Country.
Joshi.
Leave all that, Modiji.
Until you don't get a clean
chit in Godhra case by SIT court..
..how will you be able
to become the Prime Minister?
These are serious allegations on you.
Not just the public..
..how will your own party accept you?
You will get the answer
in next 30 seconds.
What do they say?
Breaking news.
For you and for them as well.
Modiji.
Jai Hind!
I'm not yet done with the interview.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Gujarat CM Narendra
Modi gets clean chit..
..in Godhra case by the SIT court.
Now, his path to the
position of PM is clear.
His eyes reflect passion
for his religion.
If Modi wins..
..he will nail Pakistan.
You've given a befitting
reply to their lies.
They were forced
to clap on your answers.
Yes, sir.
Response to your
interview is mind blowing.
He's just a regional leader.
He's popular only in Gujarat.
To rule Delhi,
he has to win over UP first.
UP?
UP is our centre.
He won't dare file nomination in UP.
Tell me from where would you..
..file your nomination
for the election?
Ahmedabad or Gandhinagar?
Benaras.
Benaras?!
Neither anyone has sent me.
Nor have I come on my own.
Only..
..mother Ganges have called me.
Benaras.
People come here to sanctify.
Now, starting from this land..
..India will also sanctify.
Even the holy water
of Ganges can't sanctify..
..this government's
sins of past 10 years.
There are many questions
regarding country's future.
And Uttar Pradesh will
answer all those questions.
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
- I salute you..
- Motherland!
- I salute you..
- Motherland!
- I salute you..
- Motherland!
- I salute you..
- Motherland!
See..
Temple, Freedom and Ganges.
Modi talks only on these three points.
Ask him.
Why he didn't wear Muslim cap?
I don't fool people
by wearing any cap.
Their only agenda from past 60 years..
..was to tap minority
for the vote bank.
I will shut down
your vote bank account.
An illiterate tea-seller
can never become India's PM.
As a PM, how will he
converse with people abroad?
He doesn't even know English.
This tea-seller knows
the meaning of ABCD.
Adarsh. Bofors.
Coal and 'Damadji' (son-in-law).
Modi. Modi.
ABCD.
I can count their scams till Z.
Learning English is no big deal.
I can teach Hindi to the foreigners.
Don't forget what he did in Gujarat.
He has a criminal past.
If you elect him, he will
turn India into another Gujarat.
It requires courage to make Gujarat.
It requires clear intentions
to make concrete roads.
And brilliance of mind to
bring electricity for 24 hours.
Yes, I am a dealer.
Not of the lives
but of the developments.
What do you exactly deal with?
Do you have any answer?
My last rally will be
on the Gandhi Ground of Patna.
And this battle will end in Delhi only.
He's right.
This will be his last rally.
This time we will not
send jihadis but soldiers.
My boys will go in your uniform.
When will your officer
reach here, sir?
They have already reached Delhi.
There's no Modi-wave
But ma'am, survey shows the fact.
Even our intelligence reports states..
..that he has gone much ahead of us.
He's wining, ma'am.
- A bad news, ma'am.
- Now what?
As per the Intelligence Bureau..
..terrorists have entered in India.
And their mission is to kill Modi.
- That's really a bad news.
- Yes.
This isn't media's conspiracy
or any political move.
This is intelligence's confirm report.
Sir, the terrorists
have already reached Patna..
..just to target you,
on Gandhi Ground.
- You must cancel this rally, Narendrbhai.
- No.
Media will get a breaking news..
..and opposition will get a topic..
..that Modi has escaped.
But Narendrabhai
I don't care about them.
Every hopeful eye
of Indians towards me..
..will be disappointed.
He, who thinks of
his own safety first..
..how will he protect the country?
Sorry, sir.
But Indiraji, Rajiv Gandhi.
They had also received
intelligent reports.
- But they ignored.
- Joshi.
I'm going to Delhi, not to run away..
..from those terrorists
but to drive them away.
Hello, mother.
Narendrabhai is not ready to listen.
You please reason him.
Hello, mom.
Mom, I've come very far.
Now don't tell me to step back.
No, I will never.
Go ahead, son.
In your childhood,
you said you want to become a soldier.
And see.
Today you've become a
solider without the uniform.
Are you crying?
A soldier's mother never cries.
In fact, she's always proud.
I'm proud of you.
Jai Hind!
Jai Hind, mom!
Tomorrow at 7 PM. Gandhi Ground, Patna.
If you want to change
the fate of this country..
..then we must face our own fears.
Sir.
Ajay, what's the security update?
Sir, scanners are installed
at all the entry points.
Police are doubled in number now.
Me and my team will be
in the crowd in civil dresses.
I've ordered the dog squad
to check the stage area once again.
Aman Bhargav.
Counter terrorism security expert.
What's your opinion?
Sir, cancel this rally.
Threat is live.
Crowd will be in millions.
It will be impossible to secure.
We will have to make it possible.
Modi. Modi.
- Ajay.
- Sir.
Both the sides of the stage,
in the centre over here..
..and on both the
sides of the main gate..
I want snipers.
I want to cover everything.
And I need four drones.
I want security camera feed..
..from every angle.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Nothing, sir. Just coming.
- Check the wiring on the stage. Quick.
- Okay, sir.
Give me drones' feed.
Where have you reached?
Sir, I'm still stuck up here.
What?
Sir, don't worry. Weapons are with me.
Hurry up.
There're news of possible
terror attack on Modiji.
Still you've come here.
Aren't you scared?
Modiji, says..
..overcome your fear.
What is your opinion?
This time, we want Modi Government.
Modi! Modi!
Modi! Modi!
Number two.
What's the update?
I am in, sir.
Good.
Number two.
Modi's convoy is here.
Move fast and stay sharp.
Number two.
Where have you reached?
Sir, right under the stage.
There will be explosion at 3:15.
Everyone be alert.
Sir, we are ready.
Leave them. Release them.
Follow, follow, follow.
Let's go. Quick.
- I salute you..
- Motherland!
- I salute you..
- Motherland!
- I salute you..
- Motherland!
Thank you for coming here..
..even in this dangerous situation.
Modi. Modi.
This is a message to our enemy..
..that our country comes
first and then our life.
Sir, we've nabbed one.
But he is jihadi.
What?
Not us, but they are scared today.
They could neither win
us on the battleground..
..nor on the cricket ground.
That's why they've come
here to fix this election.
But your presence over here
is a befitting reply to them.
Sir, there are two
more officers with him..
..on this mission.
Sir, I'm sending a
team on his safe house.
They can be anywhere in the crowd.
What's the update?
We searched the entire crowd.
But can't get the face match?
Send these images to the entry point.
Send it to the security check.
Send it on every gate.
Immediately.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
I am in, sir.
I'm reaching him.
Hey, he just passed from here.
He had a red bag.
Hello, sir.
He has just passed from here..
..with a red bag.
Move drone towards the entry point.
And give me all the
camera feeds from there.
Take camera seven behind.
Sir, red bag.
And it perfectly matches the image.
Ajay, get there with your team.
I will send his location right away.
There he is. Don't lose him.
Don't lose him.
Where did he go?
Find him. He's somewhere there.
He's disappeared.
There he is.
For them, only one family is India.
But for me, India is my family.
They are scared that
Modi will get elected.
Only the corrupts are afraid of Modi.
There he is, sir.
But he doesn't have red bag.
He must have given
it to the three men.
I am sure, the weapons are in it.
Also find the three guy.
Look for the red bag.
Yes, sir.
Ajay, go there. Go fast.
Catch him.
Yes.
Number two.
It's 3:15, but there's no explosion.
Number two.
Number two. Come in.
Number two.
Damn it.
They say..
..a tea-seller can't
be the PM of this country.
Yes, I am a tea-seller.
I used to sell the tea.
But not the country, like they did.
Every soldier can become
the PM of this country.
It's a hologram.
Every sanitation worker
can become the PM of this country.
Every farmer can become
the PM of this country.
India has changed.
Now, not your ancestral name
but your work will be noticed.
Sir, we found two of them.
But three one is still not on radar.
If 125 crores of Indians
take a step together..
..India will progress
by 125 crores of steps.
They can kill me.
But not Modi.
Because Modi is not
a human but a thought.
Modi is alive in every heart.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
- Sir, red bag.
- That's him. Get him.
Sniper, do you have a clear shot?
- He's hiding amongst the public.
- Modi. Modi.
It's difficult to get a clear shot, sir.
Modi. Modi.
Possible that sniper
can't get a clear shot.
Modi. Modi.
Ajay, over there.
- Sir.
- Sniper can't get a clear shot.
Modi. Modi.
Arrest him. Go ahead.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Arrest him.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Modi. Modi.
Hail Motherland India!
Narendra Damodardas Modi will
be India's 14th Prime Minister.
After 1984, this is the first party to..
..exclusively win 284 seats..
..and achieve absolute majority.
Invitation to the swear-in ceremony.
I, Narendra Damodardas Modi..

"Like the passion in my eyes."
"In my blood.."
"runs this country."
"This life is yours."
"I'm just your servant,
O Motherland."

our diversity in unity."
"Then how any two religions
be treated differently?"
"Let bygones be bygones."
"This is a new era,
this is a new world."
"Let religion not divide us."
"Let there be no sign on hatred."
"We make our country."
"We are a part of this country.."
"and this country is a part of us."
