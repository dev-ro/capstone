Bird chirping, gentle music, female
singing voice.
Quiet, somber music.
Blubbergeräusche.
Rock music.
Rock music.
There is a knock at the door.
Janek?
Knock.
It is urgent!
Can you please hold back the dog?
Alarm beep, the barking dog.
Knock.
Janek!
Janek!
Loud, fast knock.
Janek!
Yes.
Alarm beep, music penetrates from
the hut.
Assholes, g'schissene!
Rock music.
Janek moans.
Music stops working briefly, alarm
beep.
Music gets faster and then stops.
Alarm beep from afar.
The wind blows around the house.
Quite honestly, harald, which is
intolerable, something like that!
Alarm beep, the blowing wind.
Alarm beep.
Janek coughs.
Janek moans briefly.
The beep stops.
Thank you.
And good morning.
Harald!
Tomorrow.
What was that?
Measuring station 3 transmits no
more data.
Oh what!
And what do you do now because of
that?
I go back and just look at it to me!
Eh back of the transformer.
So, how do I stop going?
When?
As long as we are without climate
data, janek?
Need for what you are because of
climate data?
Are you collecting stones not?
But the stones are my braids and for
which there is quite interesting to
see how the climate today was.
Oh so, but basically, he has been
right, or what?
So I collect stones!
I am not a mineralogist, I collect
stones!
(Harald: ) janek how long will
because need to fix it?
Tomorrow when the Minister comes,
everything should work again.
I know!
Three hours, when it is
transformerless!
Exciting sounds, bird-like noise.
Tinni!
Tinni growls.
What is it?
Growl, squeak of the anemometers.
Quiet, menacing sounds.
Now!
Hey!
What is it?
- Eating come on!
Come.
Loud cry of a man, threatening, loud
chord.
High strings tones.
High strings tones.
Gloomy strings music.
Dismal sounds, the wind whistles.
Grumble quietly sinister sounds.
High strings sounds, rumbling.
Music sounds of blowing wind.
How long do you live here?
Since the station is here, right?
Five years.
Why?
Not why?
Not why?
Where should I start there?
Oh come on, janek!
The agency is always running only
one year.
That one agrees for a second, is
very rare.
That an extended four times?
So it is already here again not.
For there must be a reason.
One must be familiar with the
station moving forward.
Hm.
What you tell yourself, is something
else.
I do not know if it's true that,
but.
Do you remember a glaciologist, who
was on three, three and a half years
here?
Tanja monstatt.
Her scientist comes and goes every
few weeks.
You forget you.
Understand.
Come, Tinni!
We go.
Gentle, somber melody.
Gentle, somber melody.
Gentle melody.
The wind whistles.
Ominous sounds, Tinni growls.
Hey!
Hey, Tinni!
Now you stop!
Tinni!
Well, I thought you did it so well
in hand!
Tinni barks.
Lad!
Hey!
Are you g'scheit, ha?
Tinni barks.
Maybe he thinks das.
Loud, threatening tones.
What is it?
Threatening, spherical sounds.
And what is it?
I think that's what organic.
I have to take a test.
Crowing like loud.
Gloomy sounds.
Na, not!
Go! Come on, sneak up!
Right now.
Go, sneak up!
What can it be?
Heavy breathing noises.
Heavy breathing noises.
Hiss.
Hissing, menacing tones, Tinni
barks.
Ahh!
Tinni?
Pain loud.
Tinni!
Tinni whines.
Tinni?
Pain loud.
Tinni barks.
Tinni?
Tinni?
Quiet, hollow, metallic noise.
Bark.
Tinni?
Whimper.
You!
What is it?
Ha?
Whimper.
What happened there?
Dull, metallic noise in the distant.
Quieter, more menacing tone.
Tinni growls softly.
Strange, muffled barking.
Strange, muffled barking.
Strange, muffled barking.
Come on, let's go.
Come on!
Falk, janek, please come.
Why do you not answer you?
We have a small problem.
An injury.
Oh my god, what is with falcon?
Janek?
It's not so bad, fuck 'Do not act.
End.
Ouch, you're stupid?
!
Now hold still!
You're bleeding on the head.
Has this been going.
Because, do it yourself.
Whimper.
What are you doing?
The Tinni is injured.
What that also?
Bad?
No, it is.
Is not deep.
What happened?
I do not know.
He has struggled with something.
Cave in?
With what?
Probably with a rabid fox.
A fox?
Piano melody.
Nothing happens.
It will move again. Yes.
That was in the meltwater?
What is it?
Is organic?
Definitely.
Botany?
I thought erst
Often happens that certain algae
glacial ice color red, but.
These are not algae, at least none
that I've seen here.
I would say yes, there are protozoa.
But if I have not yet seen such
protozoa.
Looks as if it were just about cell
cases and they disintegrate.
What?
They disintegrate.
Uv reactive, I think, or impurities
in the bottle.
I have to go necessarily bring fresh
samples.
In the sterile container.
Janek, are you taking me?
What now?
Yeah, sure now.
No, today I bring you certainly do
not anymore.
It will soon be night and there runs
a rabid fox around.
And you're drunk.
Janek, everything ok?
No, schädelweh.
Shit.
's may be a concussion?
Oh, hogwash!
Because he would not make it down.
No matter what.
Today brings anyone anywhere.
Then you come with me.
Quite not sure.
It's much too dangerous. Night.
You'll have to!
I can ill go alone, and as soon as
the cells from.
Give peace!
Today, no one goes to the more
glacier! Point out, end.
Quiet, suspenseful sounds.
Friends.
This incident we keep to ourselves,
yes?
Tomorrow when the Minister comes.
Brings the really really bodicek
with this climber?
The woman Minister bodicek.
And if I tell them what happened.
Threatening, high melody.
Threatening, high melody.
(Harald janek: ), I understand you,
yes.
But.
Is it really a good idea, I do not
think so.
Look,
It shall be as a friendly pr-time.
The Minister, the climber and we.
We have long term much more of it
when we play.
The rabid fox out there, which would
include play?
You do not know whether the is
rabid.
Sure it's that so what makes not a
healthy fox.
Which fox attacks a dog?
Tell me, is the ever vaccinated?
Yes sure.
Which is again.
We have to say to those who come up
tomorrow.
We must warn.
No!
We have to do something else.
You get now only something nice
against the pain and then sleep du
Way.
What's that?
Morphine.
Mouth on.
Morphine?
That should go quickly.
Do you feel anything yet?
Well, what?
I can what?
You?
No.
So janek, now you go to sleep.
We make best all.
Spherical sounds.
(Radio: ) janek?
The tanja!
Janek, are you there?
Please come!
Tanja, is that you?
It's me!
Surprise!
I've thought, I've come again to
save the climate.
Moment.
Bird chirping, a cow mooing.
Shit.
What if he tells those of our rabid
fox?
Bring's done and tell the time from.
The fox he has just totally forgot.
Think 'me that
Bird chirping, a dog barking.
(Radio: ) tanja?
Yeah?
What are you doing?
Where are you?
I am now working in the ministry.
Imagine, I'm in the climate
competence team.
Tell me, you would not have me to
say earlier?
What?
That I come from?
Yes sure you come!
Why?
Because then I would no longer
there!
You'd gone to the hairdresser, or
what?
Well, shave you manage still.
We leave tomorrow morning and go
over the bullfinch charte.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
Why do not you take the passeierweg,
which is much shorter.
Which is much too steep away and the
Minister is not so fit.
Also, visit the longer distance the
better photos.
Understand.
Well then, see you tomorrow.
Yes, see you tomorrow.
Gentle piano sounds.
Shit!
Gentle music.
Drum loud blowing wind.
Threatening deep sounds.
Hiss.
Hello?
Snort.
Who's there?
Sound of tinny articles contacting
non scratch.
Sound of tinny articles contacting
non scratch.
Scratch.
Threatening low tone, smack.
Harald, I need the gun.
But quietly.
(Loud: ) what?
Growl.
Menacing hiss.
Barking and menacing hiss.
The hissing beings away, exciting,
quick tones.
Janek?
Here I am!
There's something!
What's going on?
The fox is here!
Watching! Has a face.
Janek!
Who has a horn like a beetle!
What the?
Comes in!
Fast!
(Harald: ) where are you running off
to?
What does he do?
That must be the fox, the rabid!
Janek, what is it?
Door to!
I do not know!
Is totally shredded!
Torn face!
Lock!
Because no one goes more out, is
that clear?
Janek, very quiet!
What do you think, do you have there
seen out there?
Tell me, did not you paying
attention?
Out there a run.
Do stuff!
I know what goes around there.
Janek, this fox is not only rabid,
which is now deformed, or what?
Yes, he is, however.
Janek, it's completely dark outside
and you're totally confused.
I know what I saw, damn it!
Of course we believe you, that you
have there seen anything, but look.
You're completely exhausted and sore
head.
And the painkiller.
(Falk: ) yes, and the alcohol!
We have to call off tomorrow.
Which may not come.
That's way too dangerous!
Where is the satellite phone, I have
the anfunken!
Just so you do not encounter your
ex?
As far here's the still.
Did you see that?
He wants to fight!
(Harald: ) stop!
Stop! Now sometimes quite quiet!
Janek, you're absolutely right.
The fox is a problem that we must
solve.
But tomorrow. Look, who knows,
Maybe can you handle tomorrow's even
redeem with a clear head the animal.
Or maybe he's long since dead.
Go, shut papp'n!
Tinni come! Tinni?
Tinni?
Janek!
I let 'you my bed.
I sleep 'on the bank
No, I'll go over, I want in my bed.
Come.
Hey, everything okay?
Tinni whimpers softly.
Come here.
Yes, it's fine. Come here.
Come, janek.
Come, I'll kill you over, yes?
Locked the door!
Quietly menacing tone, squeak of the
anemometers.
Who used gehürt a hunter.
Because from the waterfront.
Have crashed together.
The hunter, who was out immediately.
And Tinni,
Which is located next to the corpse,
severely injured.
Since we took him and nursed back to
health.
Tanja and me.
Who will appreciate tomorrow, the
tinnitus.
When the tanja comes.
That we see but then everything
tomorrow.
Come.
Now we go to sleep.
Exciting music.
Exciting music.
Music is getting louder and more
threatening, then stops.
(Quietly: ) monster!
The wind blows softly.
Tomorrow, janek.
Tomorrow.
Do you want a coffee?
What is he doing now?
Look!
What bring for you?
Beautiful.
Because look here!
Ham with horseradish!
But looking good.
Let it taste you.
(All: ) thank you.
Na!
That's so pretty.
We should not only take pictures
before they cram in to it?
Where is the urs?
Go s' urs, but they take a picture
of us now.
Get them here also.
A cow mooing.
Is the eat in there too?
(Radio: ) tanja, please come!
Pity!
Sorry.
Fine.
Now we have it but taste good for
us. They want an egg, bertl?
(Bertl: ) yes, happy.
Tanja, please come!
Yeah?
You, there is a small problem!
I do not know if it is so g'scheit
if you came from.
We have a rabid animal up there.
What?
Again, I do not understand you.
A rabid animal.
Like a rabid animal?
It could not be more accurate? What
kind of animal?
Yes, a fox halt - probably a fox!
Probably a fox.
Janek you want me just stop you from
coming up to you, right?
I want you to hold of nothing!
I feel a little important that you
know that.
The animal has bitten the tinnitus.
Tinni?
Janek, is it?
With us up a rabid fox running
around.
Do with it what you want. End.
Quiet sounds, a cow mooing.
Janek!
Janek?
There is a problem at the station?
No. Everything in order. They are
looking forward to us.
Can we?
A dog barks.
He comes.
What?
You have the Minister has warned?
I have said what I wanted to say.
They come.
I want to know what is going on with
my glacier.
Quiet melody.
Will you still up there?
Necessarily.
Quiet sounds, the wind blows.
Where is it?
Is determining the right spot?
Do you see?
It's gone.
I've already said yesterday!
But there was that.
You take now rehearse or not?
Slimy noise, threatening tones.
That's enough.
Come on, let's go back.
Are you crazy?
I Carry course, a core-sampling!
Come on, let me do that.
I can do that alone.
But hurry!
Yes, yes.
Slimy noise, threatening tones.
Loud hiss.
The creature ceased.
Deep, somber piano tones.
Chirping, bees buzzing.
So, I think ', which should be to
create as early as four hours.
Even for untrained.
And untrained yes we have not
included.
Definitely not.
Four hours, they believe bertl?
With breaks?
Breaks?
Because they want to make pauses?
But no, I ask 'yes only.
Breaks we do not need, right?
Jessas!
Thanks luca, thanks.
Luca?
Tell me, you're with the bodicek
bodycheck also responsible for?
What?
There's a problem, luca?
No, all the best.
It's all in order.
Tanja, s go 'please.
I rene!
Yeah?
Has given them my office this
fact-sheet about the station sent
today?
Since there is a fault inside, dr.
Monstatt has discovered.
Would you please tell us?
Happy.
It is actually not a fault.
Many pay are no longer current.
Know it, the glacier is shrinking
much faster than we thought.
Even exponentially.
Which presents us with the question
why this is so,
And also makes us worry because it
shows that science pushes boundaries
at their.
All forecasts were wrong, even the
darkest.
Slimy noise, quiet, exciting sounds.
We need something to.
Exciting sounds.
This is new!
Loud auffauchen the creature.
These were only vegetative
reactions.
Quite calm.
It is dead
How it stinks!
Such that stinks?
Is your comment?
It reeks of history of science!
Maybe I can say one thing that is?
I do not know.
Something you thinking yet?
Is an undiscovered animal species?
No.
But?
I've got a theory, but which is
unscientific.
You say the theory, please?
Only times as much:
I think 'you now that your fox was
deformed.
(Bertl: ) here.
The spot I wanted to show you.
Because we need to take a picture.
It is hard to believe, but there I
am as a kid, even tobogganing.
Went there to the glacier.
All gone.
Incredible.
We have to hold on to.
Comes.
Now we take a picture of climate
competence team.
Come, woman doctor.
Louder, more menacing chord, weird
slimy noise.
He screams.
What is it?
Servas g'schäft.
Pecks there's what?
Yes.
Wait, you're still here.
Piano sounds.
It really is true.
They are the same, I can not believe
it!
What is the same?
They are the same organisms as in
the glacier frozen.
Yes, and?
I think the animal is a crossover
from a assel and a fox.
What?
How is this going to go that?
Sit down.
I believe that these organisms are
like tiny genlabore.
And brood boxes in one.
They pass through the ingestion of
food into a body and use its dns.
And the respective dns of all
animals, which is found in the
stomach of the economic tiers.
And combine them into a new life
form.
Completely random, completely blind.
After trial-and-error basis.
According to the evolutionary
principle.
But, how will you born?
I suspect that develop einzeller to
brut wrap themselves on location and
place.
The fox at the measuring station,
his belly had burst.
Accurate, and something like a fruit
bubble attached to him.
Presents it to you:
A fox takes the glacier water to the
microorganisms.
A fox, the largest omnivore
throughout the animal world,
Eats a assel and eats a horn beetle.
And in the stomach of the fox take
the microorganisms.
The gene of fox, assel and beetles
on and mix them.
Shortly after the fox assel bursts
out of his belly, and the beetle
fox.
How come so quickly into the icy
water?
But that was only a few days.
And why so huge, how can a assel be
as large as a small dog?
Insects grow rapidly.
One can assume that all mixed beings
grow very rapidly,
Because the construction of the food
chain, it suggests that gene mix in
almost everyone.
One or more insects have been
incorporated.
Insects can not afford long
childhood.
Most reach their adult size slip
directly at or shortly thereafter.
And what if one animal,
That has eaten these organisms,
When biting a human?
Or blood licks?
The new organisms have the
microorganisms in the blood.
If they are eaten or bitten, the
carousel continues.
Each mixture is conceivable.
Exciting music.
Might go to the legends of wolf
people and mermaids back to
biological realities.
Wolpertinger!
Perhaps the Egyptian dead god was
Anubis.
Actually a human with the head of a
jackal!
Spherical, oblique sounds.
(Funk tanja: ), hello?
Yeah?
On going from the more that you take
the passeierweg?
Why would we do that?
Because is too dangerous away over
the bullfinch charte.
Dangerous?
How dangerous?
Janek, can you tell me what's going
on?
Tanja, I do not care how you go.
I want you to be as fast as possible
since.
And when it comes, please take the
passeierweg.
Why?
Just say it's a rabid fox go, okay?
A rabid fox.
Tanja, I know how that sounds, but.
You are really in great danger.
Tanja?
Okay, I'll try.
Faint whimper.
Deep, somber piano tones.
Sorry!
Please listen up all times.
Loud screech of a hawk.
What was that?
(Bertl: ) just a hawk.
Please, where to stay a rabid fox
was sighted.
Rabies?
Rabies?
It has never been up here was yes.
Yes, but there was already an
incident with a man and we have the
same opportunity,
Switch over to the direct path to
the top.
But is significantly steeper.
That's right, but we're a lot faster
and it is also not so long bright
Which, due to a fox?
We're vaccinated.
Yes and they, they are armed.
Luca what they say?
How much time we gain by I know not
the terrain.
An hour at least, I guess.
(Luca: ) woman minister, I recommend
the route to go.
Well, for my sake.
When appropriate, to me it should
not be.
Well, for my sake.
Janek, please come.
Tinni whimpers softly.
Yeah?
I've done it.
We are now on the steeper away.
Okay, great.
Whine loud sounds through the radio
device.
Was the Tinni?
Yes.
Is he good?
No.
But why?
What did he?
I thought he is vaccinated?
I do not know!
No idea.
Janek, you're not going to put him
to sleep, right?
Please do not do that, okay?
Wait, I'll come, I'd 'like to see
that yet.
You can still do something.
Well?
Hurry up.
Okay.
Quiet tones, chirping noise.
Moan.
What's up?
What is it?
Goes again.
I can manage.
What have they got?
Tanja, where are you then?
Sorry.
Have you waiting for me?
Well, not really.
We've got a case for the hospital.
What's going on?
Perhaps a sunstroke.
I do not only become short dizzy, it
goes again.
Should they return to the luca inn?
No, in no case!
Sure?
Sure.
I go already with again.
Luca, they help him.
Sure, I'll help you.
Come on now.
Heavy moan.
Loud sounds using oblique, panic
loud.
She screams.
Acute pain screaming.
What?
Why come the sooner?
I told them to take the passeierweg.
Why?
Why?
How do you mean, why? You gave me
but explains
That it is out there now teeming
with wild boar-bear-wolf monsters.
Janek!
I go to meet them.
Wait a minute!
Wait!
Now wait a minute!
Janek, you told about it?
Of the mutations?
No, that would have the not
believed.
Thank god.
Thank god!
At least das.
Janek?
You is surely clear, I mean you must
be clear that we can show that in no
case the Minister.
We must conceal it.
Janek, this is about the greatest
discovery since the science.
Always!
We still know too little to go to
the public.
Which are driven unmanageable.
Going to crowd disasters through, or
what I know.
That know the reporter, who are on
the way, which simply does not work.
You can be the one hundred % sure
that this would also see the
Minister so.
The subject of the confidentiality
obligation.
Janek!
We can not pretend as if nothing?
To time to win.
To think.
We push only once everything on the
fox.
They know anyway.
And when they're gone, we sort new
to us.
What do you say?
What do you say?
I say: To wiederschau'n.
I go to those now opposed and as
soon as the above are here in
safety, they know everything!
You punish now from not easy!
Au!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
(Shouting: ) what?
Stop!
Stop!
The wind blows.
Exciting, rhythmic tones.
(Shouting: ) this is irresponsible,
what are you doing!
Shit!
Spherical, dark sounds.
Spherical, dark sounds.
Cough and moan.
Our ailing and desperately needs a
break.
Na, in no case.
Not because of me.
They are going to look at yet.
How they look.
For god's sake. Luca?
Tanja?
The man needs a break, fox or not.
Come on!
'
Well, however.
Briefly, yes?
It looks terrible.
It is already better.
I think I've only had an allergic
reaction or something.
Is coming!
We must move on.
We have only just sat down to us
only.
Screeching, high loud.
What was that?
What was that?
Hey!
Hey, calm down! Calm down, come!
All is well.
Come on, breathe!
Breathe! Come on!
What happened?
What happened?
Tell!
Tell.
It is all good.
Everything is good!
Everything is good! Hey!
Down!
What is it?
The essence screams out loud.
The girl screams out loud.
Stay down!
Exciting sounds.
Luca, shoot!
What was that?
It's gone.
Schhhh.
Is everything okay?
The girl whimpers anxious.
Help!
Give it away!
Help!
Help me!
Give it away, please!
Screeching away the essence.
Sounds exciting and fearful scream.
Distant screech of the creature.
Luca!
Luca!
We need to help luca!
Exciting music.
Tanja?
Hello?
Tanja?
Come (bertl: ), away from there!
Janek!
Tanja!
Away!
Away.
Come janek away!
Tanja, what's wrong?
Kiss the hand.
Kiss the hand, woman minister.
Ah, mr Cracow.
've all gels.
I've read everything.
I've got many questions.
Also to the woman minis.
Ah, woman bodicek.
Away from there!
Because, she puts forth.
Yes, lie down here.
Very slowly.
Very slowly.
Urs?
Urs?
Oh god, urs is out there!
Urs! Urs! Urs! Urs! Oh god! Oh god!
Quiet!
Very quiet! Very quiet!
Urs went tal direction.
Do you hear me?
Tal direction!
He will make it.
Very quiet!
Janek, can you please help call from
below?
Fast!
Harald where that is satellite
phone?
And where are falk and birte?
(Harald: ) are.
That are out there.
What?
Why are there?
Which are again to the glacier.
To the glacier?
Harald where that is satellite
phone?
Mm. Measuring station.
In the measuring station?
Measuring station.
Only.
Only a few hours.
Only until tomorrow.
Until the woman is gone Minister.
Janek, we had no idea that such a
thing happened.
We really had the best intentions.
We were afraid of the discovery.
That you stop doing something rash.
Hey, janek, let it!
We can not help call for those.
I can call help.
I have a cell phone.
Mobile communications is not enough
to go up there.
We need the satellite phone.
But the luca has.
The luca had.
Tear 'yourself together now!
Exhausted and labored breathing.
(Shouting: ) they cease to eat a
banana if they cry!
Come again.
Come back soon.
And then clears up everything.
And then we get. Help, yes?
Look at me!
We are in safety.
All good.
Come.
Bark.
Tinnitus!
Janek, no.
No!
Please do not janek!
Let me!
Let me! I want to Tinni!
Somber melody.
So, and now very slowly.
What is this discovery?
Ha?
The wind blows.
We do not have a key.
What?
And what do we do now?
Now reg 'Do not get the key has
janek anyway.
Falcon!
The bottom of the station is a spare
key and you know it.
You simply have not thought about
it!
And you?
Sorry, I had something else in my
head.
I have examined the animal.
Anything you can do to help
sometimes.
This is not your serious, right?
Falk, not now, okay?
We have to do just what important.
Go!
Please!
With the key's would have been even
easier, colleague!
8leise: ) snout!
The wind blowing softly around the
hut.
Loud screech.
Slimy noise, birte are pained loud
by itself.
Birte screams.
Good, good, good, good!
Just quiet!
Just calm now!
Quiet just now!
Birte's pained screams fall silent.
Harald moans exhausted.
Gloomy sounds.
Hey!
Hello, you!
Hey, how are you?
Even so, come, put up since.
Yes, it's fine.
Whimper.
The door is opened.
Hey!

going on?
Yes.
Tinni!
Tinni!
Baby!
He knows me yet.
Na safe.
Tinni whines.
Who has so totally missed you.
Hath not get it.
At one time you were gone.
The wind whistles softly around the
house, Tinni whines.
You, look.
Whine, quiet melody begins.
What's that?
Sad, soft music.
Sad, soft music.
Sad, soft music.
Is already good.

Sad music.
Pained by Tinni loud, screaming
crying janek.
Exhausted breathe.
Sob.
Janek, I was pregnant.
Music sounds from.
What?
From me?
Sure of you.
What?
Deep blower melody.
That's a joke, right?
What else?
Aliens?
I understand that correctly?
They wanted to hide the fact that
they have these animals found these
mutant?
We were concerned with public order.
We had no idea that a danger
threatens, and also.
They say bird?
Raptor?
Maybe it has absolutely nothing to
do.
Yes.
Maybe it was just a bird of prey,
who has attacked at random.
Random?
Raptor?
That has had such a thorn.
Which has killed someone.
Someone is dead!
(Irene: ) they listen to!
It has no sense!
Away from there!
Idiot!
Since when access raptors because
people at?
That's a legend.
Noble animals are!
Bertl, I do like to do and the only
bite when you're asked!
Loud banging on the door.
Open!
Janek what they have to do now?
I'll get 'now the birte and the
falcon.
Janek, no.
You've no idea where they are. Which
are probably all dead
Then I find just the satellite
phone.
That's madness, janek!
Let me alone.
(Falk on shouting: ) door!
What is it?
Door on!
Door shut!
Carry on!
Close your door!
Go away there!
Go away!
Dull and slimy noise of the
creature.
The creature is hammering powerfully
against the door, are dark loud by
itself.
The loud quieter.
The creature ceased.
Falcon?
Falk where that is satellite phone?
Falcon?
With.
At birte.
At birte.
At birte?
Where is the birte?
I do not know.
Which ran away.
Since this was capricorn, who
attacked me.
Loud impact on the door from
outside.
Repeated, loud strike the door from
the outside.
Exciting music.
Hysterical scream.
Strangely distorted, deep loud the
creature.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Sneak up!
Creak, oddly distorted, deep loud
the creature.
Panicky scream.
They are gone.
Please, can finally stop?
Can it stop?
Be quiet!
Exciting music starts.
Screeching, high loud.
Panicky scream.
Waiting, here I come!
I go get the drill!
Deep, dark loud the creature.
The creature ceased.
Sweet, female vocals.
(Harald: ) end time is here.
Since we have worked a hundred years
on it and now it's there.
The hell gates have opened.
As it was in the bible.
Sweet, female vocals.
We have quasi.
Melted.
Yes, we lost touch.

And against us.
I am.
I have lost myself.
I never wanted this, I do.
Now they stop with the idiocy.
Tanja, when should get the
helicopter?
Noon tomorrow, if he hears anything
from us.
Fine.
When we are not there by then, or if
we do not report
Then get the quick panic that me
what happened.
I guess that takes three to four
hours until the wen send along.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow in the evening could be
there.
If we can fortify us by then, then
we make it.
Which are determined as before.
Urs went determined to the valley
and has brought help.
Yes, that's for sure that way.
Coming eh
But those who come looking for you
who do not know what is going on.
This is the normal mountain rescue,
completely unarmed.
The race ill in it.
No, no, no.
Hear nothing from luca, so they will
soon send along a people armed
protection.
You can not.
The small can not make it until
tomorrow.
This is a sepsis.
Which falls into coma us soon. That
reminds me.
We need the satellite phone.
The wind whistles softly around the
house.
I'm going to the measuring station.
Yes, good.
I'll go with.
Nothing, you stay there.
Why?
You're much too old.
Are you comfortable with that but
only.
But take reason to.
I'm going with.
And you go with.
I go there never get out of.
You are going very well back out.
We know if that's true, what you
said?
Perhaps the birte is somewhere else.
You bring us out there now.

Come on.
We go.
Exciting, deep, rhythmic sounds.

Bird-like loud.

For god's sake!
High violin, bird-like loud.
What is it?

May be that the girl was infected by
this.
And now it grows a mutation.
We must bring them out, right?
Before the door.
They are absolutely right.
So now no one helped, right?
And who is helped if it slips out,
huh?
It is not out there already Schirch

Even without such a

She has a pulse?
Yes.
Okay.
Now we make a union, fast.
The wind blows.
Quiet sounds.
At least here is a clear view.
Here we can see what's coming.
Do you really think that the small
has a chance?
Clear.
If we are fast enough.
Hopefully we will find the phone.
Hopefully it has not come to harm.
Can you still be the same.
What?
Whether the small croak or not, what
is it to thee?
Stop.
Less, which runs auto, breathes,
eats and farts into the air holes.
Stop it now!
And anyway she is dead but much
better off, right?
Does not need to experience how the
world goes down.
How old is she?
17? 18?
Please, it's never too late to
abort.
Stop it now!
Stop it!
Stop it now!
Stop it!
Be quiet!
What's wrong?
