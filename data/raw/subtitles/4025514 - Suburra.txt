[dishes and cutlery clattering]
[in Italian]
Your Holiness, do you need anything?
[whispering]
5TH NOVEMBER 2011
[thunder rumbling]
7 DAYS TO THE APOCALYPSE
My fellow Members of Parliament,
we will not be intimidated
by any last minute defectors
who might think this ship is sinking.
Go right ahead,
but the government is strong
and I assure you,
this ship will not sink.
It will not sink!
He told them this time.
He just doesn't get it.
I'd say you don't.
[chattering]
Excuse me.
Please, excuse me!
Great job!
Thank you, everyone!
See you on Monday. Don't forget.
Well done! Great speech!
Cut the compliments, Malgradi,
and make our friends
at the Treasury see sense.
Since you're on the committee,
talk to them yourself.
You cannot simply sit there
and second the notion.
I'm bending over backwards
for that committee, but by now...
If we'd dumped them, the government
wouldn't be about to fall.
Enough talk!
Take action!
[chattering]
How's it going with the amendment
on the waterfront of Ostia
that should be put
into the Suburban Renewal Law?
It's halfway done,
considering who's behind it...
They're the good ones...
Here they are!
Keep up the good work! Well done!
-What happened?
-We'll leave the Party.
Who would have ever thought it of you?
So straight and upright!
-You're one to preach!
-Well done! Well done!
-Have you read it?
-What?
The various European statements on us...
Fuck!
[synthpop music playing]
[indistinct chatter]
Ah, you speak Italian!
[in English] Is everything OK?
Yes?
Ninni!
-[in Italian] It's going great, isn't it?
-Yes.
Take a break. That knock-out body
might rack up some victims.
By the way, someone's asking
for you. What should I do?
It could be good. He's organizing
a conference here in Rome next year.
I could do it myself
if you put in a good word.
I'm already busy tonight.
-With him, like always?
-Yes.
I've got to find him a different girl
every night. He's obsessed.
[indistinct interview dialogue]
Thank you, everyone. Good night.
-Good evening, sir!
-Good evening.
Ms. Lagarde said Italy lacks credibility
in the measures that have been announced.
Isn't that a rejection?
No one's rejecting anyone.
Let's be serious.
The opposition says
Italy is on the brink of default.
I think it's wrong to think that Italy
is experiencing a severe financial crisis.
Consumer spending
hasn't decreased at all
and our lifestyle
is that of an affluent country.
We're not on the brink of an abyss.
-Thank you.
-Keep up the good work.
Good night, Your Holiness.
[rain pouring]
[thunder rumbling]
Darling,
the committee meeting
will go on until late.
Don't wait up.
Yes, I'm a little tired.
But don't worry.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
You can drop me off here.
-Good evening, Mr. Malgradi.
-Hi, Faisal. Any news on your son?
-Not yet.
-I'm sorry.
For your trouble...
Thank you.
Have a good night.
[Uomo screams]
[Uomo shrieks]
Shut up.
You're upsetting my girlfriend.
Listen...
How about that signature?
We've got to go, Aureliano!
[Number 8] You're wasting my time
just for a signature!
Give me that, Mirko.
[shrieks] What are you doing?
-How about that signature?
-Yes!
-[Number 8] Don't cry! Yes or no?
-[shrieks] Yes, I'll sign!
I'll sign! I'll sign!
Good man.
See? That wasn't so hard.
[Uomo screams] Don't do that! No!
[Uomo screams]
Come on!
Come on, come on!
Let's go!
[Uomo shrieks]
[Number 8] Who are all these people?
They've made the rounds of the club.
They're about to go again.
-Get to it. You think we're on vacation?
-Come on. Let's go!
-Evening, Scab.
-Don't call me that.
So? What are we doing here?
Tell Samurai that the guy at Traiano
says he'll sell.
My work is almost done.
I've got to meet with him.
-You can tell me...
-You?
Who the fuck are you?
If my dad hadn't secured you votes,
you'd still be robbing old ladies.
Your father reasoned with people.
-I'm not my father.
-I know.
In fact, you've got
more balls than brains.
Tell Samurai that
I got more contracts in two months
than my dad did in two years.
Okay?
Bye, Scab!
Roach?
He's inside.
This town has changed--
The traffic, the buildings...
Even this place. What is it?
What was here before?
Nothing.
And you? Have you changed too?
Or are you the same Samurai
you always were?
Are you still the warrior
at the service of the Idea?
I carry the Idea right here now...
and that's it.
Twenty years...
I did 20 years for heists
and neo-fascist terrorism...
But now Pippo's a big shot...
you've become the king of Rome...
And me?
Nothing...
What would you like?
A piece of your trafficking business
with Africa.
I'll handle the diamonds for you
from there.
And if I say no?
-You can't.
-Why not?
Because this time, I won't keep quiet.
What's in your hand?
Don't worry, my cards are good.
There's nothing in your house.
We cleaned it out when they arrested you.
That's what lawyers are for.
You're bluffing.
And you're not good at it.
If I'm bluffing, show your hand.
Your lawyer is on my payroll...
and has been for years.
[thunder rumbling]
[tires squealing]
[shouting]
[panting, grunting]
[thunder rumbling]
Ilena!
What's the matter?
Fuck, she's really sick.
Ilena!
[shouts] Ilena!
[thunder rumbling]
[Malgradi sighs heavily]
-And she's a minor.
-It's what you asked for.
I know! Help me. Shit!
[Sabrina sobs] What do you want me to do?
You're the big shot. Call someone!
I can't call anyone.
[Sabrina] What about
that colonel friend of yours?
And what do I tell him?
Let's get her out of here.
Have you got the car?
-No, I sent the driver away.
-Call him back.
[shouts] Shut up!
Don't talk shit! Shut up!
[Sabrina sobs]
[Sabrina sighs]
I have to go. I can't stay here.
I'm sure you can understand that.
You can't leave.
Will you please cover her?
Cover her. Shit!
[Malgradi sighs]
So?
I'll call a friend of mine.
Good.
You do that.
[shower running]
[shouting]
I'm off on my usual rounds.
Send the kids to bed.
It's like Christmas here.
Okay, get to bed!
[children shouting]
Okay, get to bed!
His Eminence...
What's the matter? Does he feel ill?
No, it's not that.
It's... more.
It's something
I should probably keep to myself,
because the Holy Father confided in me
as though I were his son...
but the burden is too heavy to carry.
What did he tell you?
The Pope wants to step down.
That can't be!
Did he say
when he intends to do this?
Very soon.
[synthpop music playing]
Don't you ever get sick of this place?
Why don't you sell it?
No way!
Do you know what's about to happen here?
Ostia is going to be like Las Vegas.
You'll see how much it'll be worth then!
Why do you like it so much?
Because it's all mine.
Don't you like it?
You don't?
And what do you like?
You.
And this? Do you like this?
Yeah, that too.
That too?
Don't you love it most of all?
No, not most of all.
What's better?
Watching you sleep.
[Malgradi] Okay, so...
I'm leaving.
Don't contact me, I'll call you.
-Need any help?
-No, Faisal. She drank too much.
-Should I call for a taxi?
-I'm the taxi. Bye!
6TH NOVEMBER 2011
You look tired.
Yeah, Dad, I'm exhausted.
I just got off work.
What did you want?
Nothing in particular.
You called me three times tonight.
That's because
I went to the cemetery yesterday.
Couldn't you go too, once in a while?
Your mother's grave
was full of dead flowers.
-If she were alive, she'd like that.
-I'd like for her to be alive too.
Listen, I'm dead tired.
I need to get to bed.
Why don't I come by
the construction site tomorrow?
Actually, tomorrow's no good,
but the day after...
Friday?
Asking you to come here was a mistake.
Dad...
-Need a lift?
-Bye, Seba.
I'll pay.
How much?
Thank you.
[shouting]
[man] Stop!
[man shouts] He jumped!
Call someone!
Call an ambulance! Hurry!
[pants]
[gasping for breath]
[indistinct shouts]
[pants]
Mr. Malgradi won't be here
for another hour. If you'd like...
All right, I'll wait.
Got any coffee around here?
Make me happy
and add a drop of cold milk!
Someone wants to talk to you.
We heard of your loss. My condolences.
Thank you.
You must come with us now.
-Where?
-To see Manfredi.
So he can explain everything.
-Explain what?
-Why your father decided to fuck off.
How dare you speak to me like that!
Do I know you?
Calm down.
-Don't you know who Manfredi is?
-No, I've no idea.
Your father knew him well.
They were in business together.
He's my uncle.
We have the same last name-- Anacleti.
I'm sorry, let's talk about this
some other time. Tomorrow...
No, not tomorrow. Today.
Believe me, it will be better.
That person wants to talk to you.
I wasn't able to send him away.
How are you, Mr. Malgradi?
Is everything okay?
Excuse me, who are you?
We saw each other last night.
Do you want to discuss this
in front of everyone?
No.
Come with me.
From now on, you and your playmates
will get your coke from me,
and your hookers too.
You'll get them from me too.
And, seeing as you have dealings all over,
allow me to cash in on something...
What dealings? Cash in...? What?
I'm not a businessman,
I'm a politician.
Exactly. What the fuck
do you think I'm saying?
Politicians eat,
and you've got to let me eat too,
or I'll go to the cops
and tell them everything.
I understand.
How much?
I'll find a way to get it to you.
You don't understand. I want you
to get me in with the right people.
It's your decision.
Relax.
I'll give you time to make it happen.
I know you're worried.
Killing a minor with an overdose
doesn't happen every day.
I didn't kill anyone.
You have one day.
I'll be back tomorrow.
[children shouting]
[loud chattering]
Hello.
Do you know why
your father killed himself?
No, I don't.
Debts...
He had a mountain of debt,
owed to us.
Things hadn't been
going well for him lately.
I know he went through
a tough period two years ago.
That continued...
so we took on all of his debts.
We're talking millions here.
So, everything he had is now ours.
He passed on earlier than expected
and we want our investment back.
My friend, when the flesh runs out,
you make do with what's left,
even the nerves and the bone.
Get my drift?
Too bad nothing's in my name,
or I could have...
We've got off to a bad start.
What about the villa where
you throw parties? Isn't that yours?
No, it's in the company's name.
All I have is stock.
But you own the majority, so it's yours.
Not exactly.
I'll give you a week
to hand over the villa,
the house, car and all the small change
you can scrape up.
I'm furious with your father...
so if you don't go away now, I'll chop
your leg off, put it in the fridge
and return it when you bring me the money.
[chattering]
Scabbre...
I need help.
You have to help me.
-You're asking me for help?
-Yes, only you.
I had a visit from a guy...
who needs to be taught that
certain things cannot be accomplished.
[banging]
[cell phone ringing]
[cell phone continues ringing]
-[sighs]
-Who is it?
A scab.
I'm listening.
Hi, Dagger.
Hi. You scared me.
The devil himself can't scare you!
Wait a minute.
The politician made a complaint.
Why the fuck did you go to his office
while people were there?
-It's none of your fucking business.
-You can't do that.
We treat those people differently.
What do you want?
Are you his butler?
Why didn't he come directly to me?
For the same reason
your brother didn't go...
and sent you instead.
Manfredi doesn't even know
I went to see him.
This is my own deal.
Politics isn't your thing. Forget it.
And who's thing is it? Yours?
Sorry, but you've got to make room for me.
I'm sitting at this table too.
Why do you touch your dick when you talk?
Got the clap?
-Maybe you do.
-Don't fuck around with me.
Who knows. Maybe I do.
Manfredi was right when he said
the Atlantic separates you and your pa.
Your brother doesn't even know
where the Atlantic is, Dagger.
So, I'll tell him you'll be by
to give him a geography test.
-Good!
-Now get the fuck out of here!
[Dagger gurgles]
[Dagger whimpers]
7TH NOVEMBER 2011
[woman wails] Manfredi!
[cries] Manfredi! Manfredi!
[shouting]
[wailing]
[female news anchor over TV] He died
next to the locked door of his car,
a brand new luxury SUV.
He may have been attempting to run
when he was attacked from behind.
Alberto Anacleti was a young man
who grew up in this area.
He was known to police
by his nickname, Dagger.
We're on the south-east side of Rome,
home to many strip clubs.
Forensics are hard at work
where the incident occurred last night.
The victim was a young man of about 25.
It appears he was stabbed.
At the moment,
the police are investigating the area,
but the weapon
still hasn't been found.
Hi, Pippo.
ACCIDENT OR EXECUTION?
Did you read about Roach?
Did you do it?
It was Rome.
It's too dangerous to even
cross the street in this fucking city.
Over time, I've learned
to take it easy with the dead.
They're tough to handle.
But it seems you don't know about that.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck were you thinking
calling Aureliano Adami
to resolve a matter
involving the Anacleti family?
Manfredi Anacleti is one
of the most badass fucks in Rome.
I didn't call anyone.
I don't know this Aureliano Adami.
-He's called "Number 8".
-I said I don't know him!
I just wanted to scare the idiot
who was blackmailing me.
I spoke to a party member
who has contacts...
Why didn't you call me?
I haven't seen
or heard from you in years.
How the fuck was I to know
the asshole would kill him?
How did you find out?
I know lots of things.
So, why are you here?
To give you a hand.
If anyone causes trouble for you,
I'll cover you.
In exchange,
I need the Suburban Renewal Law.
It's in the works.
With the amendment
for the Ostia waterfront?
-No. That still...
-Vote for it, along with the amendment.
-You're on the committee, right?
-Yes, but I can't...
I repeat, vote for it.
In a few days, your party
and the government will fall apart.
Rumors, gossip...
Anyway, I'll ask the party leaders...
Your leaders no longer exist.
If the law is passed before the
government falls, meaning in a few days...
Santa Claus will bring
your foundation a couple million.
Just push the law in the Chamber.
Get back the defectors' votes...
Cuts are in the air. How can I do that?
If it's money you need, no problem.
We can buy anyone.
Just do your part.
I'll deal with the rest.
Got it?
Yes.
Say, "Okay!"
Okay.
Who was the girl
that was there that night?
What do you think? She was a hooker.
Where does she live?
-No, wait...
-She's the only witness.
No!
She won't talk. She won't say a thing.
This is absurd! Couldn't we have met
in a more discreet place?
-I feel safer here.
-What does that mean?
-I'm scared of you.
-Of me?
You ordered for Dagger to be killed.
How can you even think that?
I know loads of things about you.
I've got everything-- Photos, videos...
I filmed you when you slept, did drugs...
If anything happens to me, I'll ruin you.
You can't touch me!
I didn't ask anyone to kill Dagger.
It was the mistake of an asshole
from Ostia called "Number 8".
What you don't understand...
is that someone much worse
might come after you.
From now on, don't talk about me,
and I won't talk about you.
It's convenient for both of us.
You have to go now.
Don't go back home.
Do you hear me?
Don't go home.
[doorbell ringing]
-Seba...
-Ninni!
You have to help me. I'm in trouble.
No, please...
You don't understand the mess I'm in.
-I know...
-Really, please...
Please, I can't go home. I'm scared.
Can I stay with you?
Just for tonight!
[kisses]
That old guy is the great Samurai?
And he goes around everywhere alone?
He was the only one in the Magliana gang
that my dad was scared of.
Why?
He knows a lot.
The Mafia all respect him.
You and your family
are only part of this deal
because it's taking place here in Ostia,
on your turf.
You worry me.
You want to be the boss
but still haven't learned how to.
I don't like the way you talk.
I respect you.
But I want to be respected too.
You respect me, so you killed a guy
you should have just scared?
He wanted in on the deal.
He told me so!
Don't bullshit me, Aureliano!
The Anacletis don't know
a fucking thing about all of this.
What's all the fuss about?
I took a dickhead off the streets!
No back talk. Just do what I say.
You have to do what your father did.
My father licked all the asses
of the Families of the South.
I won't do that.
The "Families of the South"
poured millions into this deal
and I'm their guarantor.
I want to work in peace.
Is this big deal really going ahead?
We do lots of talking!
It's happening, if we cut the shit.
Can you be good
for a couple of weeks?
Answer me.
-I can, I can.
-I hope so, for your sake.
[exhales]
I want to know who he saw last night.
Look for them one by one.
Find them.
So, it was the brother of...
This guy that died
was Manfredi's brother.
Manfredi, the...
The Anacletis,
the gypsies!
Now this guy's after me.
Who? The guy from Ostia? Really? Why?
Maybe they're two different things...
Maybe it was a thing between gangs.
Maybe you have nothing
to do with this.
These guys...
I have to leave now.
I have an appointment.
It'll all work out, you'll see.
Stay as long as you like.
Bye, Ninni!
Bye.
[door closes]
[dog snarls]
[Manfredi blows raspberry]
[children shouting]
Is Manfredi here?
[indistinct shouts]
Is Manfredi here?
I want to talk to Manfredi.
Not today. Come back tomorrow.
It's really important.
What?
I know who killed Dagger.
Let him in.
[dog growls]
So?
How do you know who did it?
A rumor...
I know all of Rome.
Give me a name.
But...
the villa where I work...
You have to let me keep it.
Take the rest.
I want that name right now,
or I'll throw you in the cage with him.
It was a guy from Ostia.
He's got a nickname.
What nickname?
Number 8.
-Do you know him?
-[sighs deeply]
Do you know why?
[Manfredi hisses]
He's gone from a kitten to a tiger,
thanks to all the beatings.
He nearly ripped my nephew's arm off
the other day.
So, you'll have him put down?
No, I respect all warriors...
as long as they show me
they've got courage.
Now get out.
So, the villa...
I told you to get out.
My brother's dead, not my cat!
-Sorry.
-We mourn alone.
Ninni.
It's me.
[Sebastiano groans]
I've been waiting so long.
You never came back.
Where were you?
Public relations...
I'm cold.
[Sebastiano groans]
Poor thing.
I'll warm you up.
May I?
I'm going home tomorrow.
Why?
You can stay as long as you like...
at least until they kick me out.
Who's going to kick you out?
No, I just meant it...
as a joke.
I feel good here, with you.
You do?
Can I say something stupid?
I do it all the time!
If I had a brother like you,
I wouldn't be a hooker.
No? Why, what else can you do?
-I can do lots of things.
-Like what?
I can play hopscotch...
jump rope...
Anything a little more... modern?
I kick butt at video games.
[laughing] Okay, that's good.
Want to fuck?
Thanks for the offer, though.
[kisses]
I can just picture this town
looking different.
All the lights,
cars coming and going,
neon signs, fireworks...
It'll be one big party, day and night.
All the skyscrapers...
games rooms, slot machines, casinos...
And a mile-long row of restaurants,
clubs, people having fun,
top-notch pussy...
All rich...
all beautiful.
8TH NOVEMBER 2011
Okay.
See you next week.
What are you doing?
[cell phone chiming]
[tires squealing]
They're coming.
We'll have to buy this guy something,
or we'll look bad.
[Viola screams]
[in English] Now!
[Number 8 in Italian] Stay down!
Go!
[Number 8 pants]
[screaming]
Cover your face. There are cameras.
[screaming]
Wait.
[sobs] It's just a scratch.
[screaming]
Let's go.
[Number 8 gurgles]
[Number 8 gasps]
Don't die on me, my love!
My love!
[sobs] You can't leave me, please!
[Number 8 gasps]
Get up!
Let's go.
Come on! The cops are coming.
[Number 8 groans]
I'm here with you.
[Viola sobs]
What should we do?
Aureliano! Aureliano!
[Viola] Mirko!
Go!
[Viola cries out]
Come on, come on!
[Viola] He can't walk, Mirko!
[Viola cries] He can't walk!
Go!
Go, go, go!
9TH NOVEMBER 2011
3 DAYS TO THE APOCALYPSE
I'm not asking you
to change your mind.
Just support me
on the Suburban Renewal Law.
Politics has nothing to do with it.
It's about Ostia.
It's a big project.
If you say yes, you'll be part of it.
Meaning?
The firm handling the funds
for the waterfront
will need a CEO.
Interested?
What exactly would I have to do?
What do you need?
Your vote.
I already have your friends' votes.
A few more here and there...
If you say yes, I'll feel more at ease.
It's a zoning issue.
If they break your balls about it,
tell them the agreement was made
before you left the Party.
Will I have a CEO's salary?
-500,000 a year.
-Plus benefits.
Obviously.
-A car with a driver, trains, flights...
-Of course.
The length of the contract?
Four years.
Renewable.
Alright.
There are just a few days left
to get the law passed,
so we need
to free those funds now.
That's impossible.
It takes time to make
such large sums available...
Just a few days,
or it'll all blow up in our faces.
I'm sorry. I really don't know
how it can be done.
It's impossible.
Unfortunately, at this very moment,
there's something...
bigger than me, or you,
but don't make me say it.
Your Eminence...
you're too intelligent
not to consider the consequences
of the attitude you're taking.
If the deal backfires...
they'll put you
at the bottom of the Tiber.
And I'd rather see a better fate for you.
Alright,
but, with the increase in risk,
the expected quota
will have to increase too.
That won't be a problem at all.
Feel any better?
I didn't sleep all night.
The wound stings.
You've got to leave.
I've got a fishing shack set up for you.
It sucks, but it's really hidden.
I'm not leaving.
I'd like to see if they come.
They all know you're here.
It's not safe.
Cover her, please.
When should I go?
Today.
Then we'll fuck the Anacletis up the ass.
They think they freaked us out. When
their guard is down, we'll fuck them up!
We'll go after them tonight.
[Viola] Do what you have to do.
Slaughter those gypsies!
Nobody is doing anything.
We're not going to do a thing.
[Viola] Why?
-I made a promise.
-To who?
To whoever the fuck I want.
[Viola]
We can't let them get away with this.
I make the decisions.
No more fucking around
or it'll all backfire on us.
Tell everyone to sit tight.
[priest] "I am this bread from Heaven",
said the Lord,
"If any man eats of this bread,
he shall live forever."
-The body of Christ.
-[all] Amen.
I heard that before he died,
Dagger was called by a piece of ass...
who's in the big leagues,
one of those who cost a lot.
That night, she was in trouble,
so she called my brother.
Those are the shitty people
you hang with, right?
Do you know her?
Cat got your tongue?
-What do you want with her?
-Just a chat.
Do you know her, or not?
Where is she?
Tell me what you want to know.
I'll talk to her.
Do you want me to be pissed off in church?
Just tell me where she is.
Don't drag your feet about it.
Tell me where I can find her.
She's at my place.
At my apartment.
Lord, grant him eternal rest,
and let Your perpetual light
shine upon them...
O God, creator and redeemer
of all the faithful,
grant the souls of the deceased
universal remission of sins.
Seba!
I just want to know the name
of the guy who was with you.
What do you care?
He wasn't involved in Dagger's death.
I think he got Number 8
to get rid of a witness.
He didn't call Number 8.
-How do you know?
-I just do.
Because I know him.
He'd never even think about it.
Give me his name. I'll do the rest.
I...
You don't understand.
Let's do it this way...
I ask a question and you answer,
or I'll cut your sweet face.
-Who was it?
-He's a politician named Malgradi.
Malgradi?
I'll tell you all about him.
Just don't hurt me.
I can't stand being here.
The mere thought of it bores me.
Get up, Viola.
Go take a walk!
Get out. I want to be alone!
Take me to Rome. I've got to get a wax.
-Pull over here.
-Here?
[receptionist] Hello.
Miss?
Excuse me,
do you have an appointment?
Stop, miss, please.
Fuck off!
[woman] Can I help you?
Hey!
[woman crying]
[screaming]
Let's go.
Come on!
[car horns honking]
10TH NOVEMBER 2011
Thanks for coming.
You never age.
I haven't seen you in ten years.
Stop messing around with the Ostia guys.
I'm not messing around.
By trying to kill Number 8,
you almost caused a massacre.
Let me remind you
that he killed my brother...
and a few hours later, they killed
two kids who I watched being born.
No one can stop me from seeking revenge.
Now is not the time
to have a fucking war brewing between you.
I'm working on a project,
in the interest of the Families,
and I need peace and quiet.
A project?
What project?
A project.
It must be a big deal
if you're involved in it.
How come I don't know anything about it?
Because it's in Ostia.
It involves politics, finance...
Until yesterday,
you were loan sharks for nobodies.
Okay, but we've grown up now,
and they all respect us.
To your face, because you scare them,
but behind your backs?
They still call you shit gypsies.
You're still a couple of Shylocks.
I don't give a fuck
about that bullshit.
I just want to even up the corpses.
I'm only sorry
I didn't kill Number 8 like a dog.
I've told you what I had to do.
Think twice before going against me...
and the Families.
You piece of shit!
You're a piece of shit!
You make me sick!
I trusted you! Fuck you!
At the parties you organize,
full of pussy and dirty politicians,
have you ever heard talk
of this project?
Tell me who's behind it
and I'll give you your villa back.
Of course I've heard about it.
It's a huge project.
They want to make
a kind of Las Vegas in Ostia-- Casinos...
A group has been pushing for months,
but approval has been set for next year.
It's happening now.
They've somehow moved the project forward.
I don't know about that.
To push it through,
they need a politician.
It might be this Malgradi.
Aida! I'm working.
Malgradi?
Maybe.
-Maybe?
-Yeah.
[shouting]
Get out, all of you!
You've pissed me off!
You're driving me nuts!
You know what? I'm leaving!
Let's go. Come with me.
Fucking bastards!
You're just fucking bastards!
Damn them!
[dog snarling]
You fuck off, too!
You piece of shit!
I'd like to call on this politician.
Do you know where he lives?
Yes.
-What do you mean by "call on"?
-A courtesy call.
Has he got a bodyguard?
He has a driver, but no bodyguard. Why?
Let's go. Move.
This building, top floor...
Let me see...
-Perfect.
-He lives here.
Let's go!
-Give me enough time to walk away.
-You're coming, too.
You're a better talker than me.
You talk to him.
With all the times we crossed paths
at parties? He'll recognize me!
See? He won't recognize you now.
Is this a joke?
Don't piss me off!
You can't go. You're in this with us.
You've got to get your hands dirty,
so you don't go running to the cops.
[indistinct conversation]
[banging]
-[wife] What's going on?
-[Manfredi] Stop, you piece of shit!
What do you want?
Please don't hurt us!
[Manfredi] Shut up!
Give them everything! Please!
[Manfredi] Now listen to my friend
and answer him straight.
Say you will.
Say you will!
-Yes.
-[Manfredi] Louder!
-Yes.
-[Manfredi] Come here.
Come on!
The bill for the construction
of all those hotels,
the casinos and the Olympic
structures on the beaches of Ostia,
is going to be passed now, right?
We're talking about
the "Waterfront", right?
Is it true that you're the one
who's seeing that this law is passed?
-Is it you or not?
-I'm involved, too.
-Mommy!
-[wife] Sweetie, stay away! It's nothing!
[Manfredi] Shut up!
Look at me!
Do you know me? Get a good look!
-Do you know me? Know who I am?
-No, I don't.
I'm the brother
of the guy you had killed--
Dagger's brother.
-I didn't do...
-You filthy rat!
He's gone,
and you're still here breathing,
so listen up good.
You've got to block this fucking law,
and tell your bosses at the top
we want a cut of 20%.
Twenty percent.
Tell them that. Do as I say.
And as collateral, lovely lady,
we're taking this little toy.
And if you call the cops,
the toy might get broken.
It might get broken!
You're sure you just put him to sleep?
Don't worry, he's all yours now.
Meaning?
Keep an eye on him and tell me
if there are any problems.
But...
How do I figure into this? I can't do it!
You're mine now.
I'll do whatever the fuck I want with you.
Now take me to your house.
We'll hide the kid there.
Pippo!
I have to talk to him.
-[man] Good evening.
-Get lost.
-[man] Who the fuck...?
-Get lost!
Go outside! You guys, too. Out!
What happened?
Manfredi Anacleti came to my house
and kidnapped my son.
You said you'd protect me.
You didn't do a fucking thing,
so our deal is off!
I'll bring him home, just relax.
I won't "just relax".
I don't believe anything
or anyone anymore, especially you!
You can shove this law up your ass.
Shove it up your ass!
Pippo, you don't have to do anything.
Just calm down and listen to me!
Go home. Go and be with your wife.
What did he ask for in exchange?
He wants a cut of the deal.
Twenty percent.
I'll fix this thing for you.
Nothing will happen to your son!
11TH NOVEMBER 2011
Don't get any closer.
Come on!
Don't complain.
Any other guy would have thrown you
off a bridge for the shit you've pulled.
What were you thinking?
That we're playing cops and robbers
and having fun?
That's not the fucking case!
If there's any bullshit, the millions
will be gone, and we'll get years in jail.
-We can't always let it go.
-What the fuck do you know?
You made a mess!
I evened the score, didn't I?
Now it's World War 3
against the gypsies!
Is that my fault?
Yeah, it's your fault.
Careful!
Careful!
Go! On three. One, two, pull!
Careful!
[female news anchor over TV]
A grim chance discovery--
The body of a woman
was found this morning
at the bottom of a man-made lake
on the outskirts of Rome.
The ones who raised the alarm
were the maintenance men
charged with emptying the basin.
Police are investigating.
Little news has emerged,
but it seems it's the body
of a very young woman.
At first examination,
the body may have been
in the water for three or four days,
but autopsy results are needed.
The man-made pool of water
is located on the outskirts
to the south of the capital.
It's hard to find eyewitnesses,
as the entire area is deserted...
I know, what we did was shit.
So, how do we fix it?
I made an agreement with Manfredi--
He's involved in the project now
and to pay for the deaths
you caused, he'll take part of your cut.
-No way, this isn't their turf!
-I've already decided.
That's just great,
but I've been working my ass off
for a year getting villas and land sold.
I'd say you can just go to Manfredi
and say the deal's off.
And the junkie--
You gotta give her to me.
Hands off Viola, she's mine.
And don't call her that,
it bothers me.
So, no junkie
and no deal with Manfredi?
Exactly.
Anyway, you know nothing moves
in Ostia without my okay.
And I'm not like my father...
so I don't give a fuck who you are,
who you were, what you represent.
You're a total nobody to me.
You used to be somebody...
But this is today!
You used to be somebody...
and now I'm somebody.
12TH NOVEMBER 2011
THE APOCALYPSE
[Number 8] Move!
[Number 8] Getting some sun?
[Viola sobs]
[man grunts]
[Viola sobs]
[man] Have you all voted?
Have you?
May I close proceedings?
Voting is closed.
In favor 380, against 26.
The Chamber approves.
It was passed!
[applause]
It was passed.
[cell phone vibrating]
Hello?
Get down!
Hello?
Hello.
It passed, give me back the doll.
[groans]
Where...
[line disconnects]
Hello?
[sighs]
[Sebastiano] It's all okay.
The kid's fine.
My work's done, right?
Tell me tomorrow.
I have to go now, my family is waiting.
About that promise...
I told you I'm going now.
It'll just take a second,
all I need are the keys.
I'll decide when I have time,
and I don't right now.
What does that mean?
You've got time now!
I'm asking you for what's mine!
I did it all, everything!
Are you raising your voice in my house?
What's yours?
I need the villa to work,
do you understand? You owe me!
The most I can do is offer you a job.
I don't want it, I want what's mine!
You don't have a fucking thing.
How the fuck can you be this way?
You piece of shit!
You rat, you scum!
Want to die?
Want to die?
Throw him out!
-Well, are you satisfied?
-What do you think?
I hope this marks the start
of a political change of heart for you.
Steady on-- One step at a time.
You can sign the contract tomorrow--
I got you what you asked for.
You won't be sorry
for the choice you made.
Congratulations!
I didn't think you could pull it off.
You're not the only one.
Now can we stop warring in the Party?
Starting tomorrow, we work side by side,
even in your nice foundation.
I await you with open arms!
[man] Let's have something to eat.
[Malgradi] How are you?
Thanks for coming.
[cell phone chiming]
I'd rather not be here--
I don't have good news.
I just received a tip-off about you
from the DA's office.
The DA's office?
They want to issue an arrest warrant
to the presidential offices of Parliament.
An arrest warrant?
That's absurd.
Well, it concerns a dead girl.
[cell phone chiming]
I got mixed up in that by chance,
I didn't even know the girl.
I'm not the one you need to convince.
They're investigating a night
of drugs and sex with a minor.
Listen, you know what?
As things stand, in this country,
a guy like me,
who's gotten where I am,
and arrived where I've arrived,
can tell the Judiciary to fuck off!
I'm a Member of the Parliament
of the Republic of Italy.
They can shove it up their asses!
-You know I'm always here for you.
-Thank you.
[cell phone chiming]
This isn't personal.
This is Norwegian salmon--
Our friend orders it.
Fuck!
-[woman] Everything okay?
-Excuse me.
[cell phone pinging]
[second cell phone pinging]
[man on radio] At 8:30, after the
Chamber's approval of the Stability Law...
Could you turn up the radio?
...the Prime Minister will offer his
resignation to President Napolitano.
The Stability Law has received
final approval.
Now, we await his resignation,
then the Head of State
will begin consultations.
The outgoing Prime Minister will have
many meetings,
starting with one
with his probable successor.
Annamaria dear, this is Malgradi,
would you put the Prime...
Filippo Malgradi.
Put the Prime Minister on, please?
I have to speak to him
before he leaves.
Annamaria, if we go to elections,
he's not the only one at risk. We all are.
If we go to early elections,
my seat has to be secure.
Five minutes and I'll be...
[shouts] Damned fucking slut!
[man on radio] A small crowd has gathered
before Montecitorio and Palazzo Chigi...
[crowd] Dirty crooks!
What's all this?
[man on radio] Piazza Colonna is
closed off, people are standing, waiting,
their eyes
on the entrance to Palazzo Chigi.
-[Malgradi] What's happening?
-Good evening, it's all closed off.
[Malgradi] Look...
-The Prime Minister's waiting for me.
-[officer] Sorry, it's all blocked off.
[Malgradi] Sorry, excuse me.
[crowd chants] Resign, resign...
[Malgradi] Excuse me, I must get through!
Excuse me, sorry!
[man in crowd] Malgradi, you crook!
You should go home, at your age.
Let me through, please!
Excuse me!
Don't shout, I can hear you!
No need to yell, I can hear you!
[woman in crowd] Go home!
[Malgradi] Excuse me, sorry.
Will you let me through?
The Prime Minister is waiting for me!
Will you let me through?
I must see the Prime Minister!
Mr. Prime Minister!
Mr. Prime Minister, we have to talk!
They're attacking us!
Mr. President, you mustn't resign!
The Judiciary, Mr. Prime Minister!
I have to be re-elected!
[thunder rumbling]
[grunts]
[dog snarls and barks]
[yells]
[dog barking and snarling]
[yells]
[yells]
[yells]
[screaming]
It doesn't matter.
Anyway, he got the law passed,
didn't he?
If there are new elections,
we'll find a politician...
maybe on the other side.
Yeah.
[elderly mother] Are you leaving already?
Yes.
But I'll come by tomorrow.
Mom, the cake?
You didn't even taste it.
I went all the way
to the Kosher shop to get it.
I don't like anything anymore.
You're telling me!
I have to make such an effort.
It's raining so hard.
-Wait a while.
-I'm all covered up.
-Want me to eat some?
-Just a little.
-How much? A lot or a little?
-A little.
Like this?
-Are you happy?
-Good girl.
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.
[thunder rumbling]
You're making a mistake.
[Viola] Move.
I want to make a deal.
A deal?
-With me?
-Yes, with you.
Maybe next time.
FOR MY FATHER
