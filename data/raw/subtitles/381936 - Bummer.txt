OK, quickly, we are setting
everything on fire.
I will put gazoline on top and you
should fill through the windscreen.
Put more inside, so the cockpit
would burn entirely.
Wait, Dimon, if it's without an alarm,
I'll take her to me.
Do we want to punish that guy,
or do you need a 'Boomer'?
We'll punish this businessman anyway,
if I'll take this Boomer to me.
Great...

Not exactly.
Why are you so freaked?
We just escaped from some
'kids on bikes'.
They followed us.
Somebody sneaked that we've visited KULIBIN.
Cops visited KOT's mother.
How they sniffed us so fast?
How? Your car left there.
They could seen plates on my scrap too.

Petja, this 'shit' has been written
by Mozart. - And who is this?
Hallo.

except you. Need to switch off.
What? - Can't find my phone.
Nobody seen?
Look in front.

We'll say that doesn't know anybody.

Looks like green tea to me.
Finish up your performance, commander,
You put it here yourself.
You thin we are idiots? - Go to your
farms and make joke on you farmers there.
This is crime -
keeping and selling of drugs.
So, we'll go to the precinct,we'll

Right now they are identified.
Search is underway...
Come on, Cat. I got you a soup here.

Fucking shooter!
I don't understand...
Do you blame me?
Or do you think I did
this for myself?
OK, I can go to cops myself,
if you mean it.
What should I have done
with these morons?
This dumb-ass lost his car,
you got under attack...
...that guy tried to reach his gun.
Do you want to be called 'beggers'?
I don't want that. Is that clear?
Can you calm down?
- Why he's playing a 'boss' game.
It's already enough, why start
battling with each other.
Who's gonna win out of this.
Where's our meal?
I know another guy,
we can stop there for a while.
Need to call him, but
not sure if he's there.
Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

What are you saing? What Dog woman?
You nuts or making jokes?
Hold on, guys. Tell us about
Dog woman? - Old woman.
She's taking care of wounds or births.
Last year Vitya chopped off his

The car's stuck!
Come on! Faster.
Go, go!

What a shit!
Wait, we'll push again.
Where you go, Rama?
Do you listen to us?
Where you going?
Wait I'll help.
So, what am I suppose to do?
I think we are going wrong way.
Why are you quiet?
Cat, at least you tell him!
Where do we go, in this shit.
Hey, is anybody home?
Hey, err, Dog Woman, open up!
Go inside!
Carefull!
Cat, go here quickly.
Look! - Dog Woman!
Get up!
I think she's dead.
Her eyes like a glass.
Listen, if she breathes?
- You listen. - No way.
Let's find some medications.
Everything sour!
- Enough eating.
I shouldn't leave the drink
Still alive?
What do you need?
You want to steal something?
What's she's doing with him?
May be we should see?
It's ok without us, I think.
Screaming - then he's alive.
What's with tires?
Blew? - You don't need to know.
You have too many nails on roads.
You seems from far away.
Meeting someone or what?
You can stay even at Dog Woman.
She heals people from whole state.
You have too many questions, for a driver.
Don't afraid of Dog Woman?
Listen. Pull carefully, slowly,
or you break this to hell.
I am just asking?.
You seems very angry, 'city people'.
Do you need this -
'where are you from'.
Less know - longer live.
 - That's fair.
Ready?
- OK, slowly.
Go, go, go!
Thanks, man, take it.
Too much.
I may get drunk from this.
- I don't have less.
Then I'll have to get drunk, understand?
Looks like you're 'in charge'?
She's told that she'll cook us potate if we'll peel it.
I am damn hungry.
How's Dimon?
She says he's ok,
but don't let me see.
He's crying all way, 
it seems he's very bad.
She's cooking some herbs.
Damn smell!
When do you plan to be quiet?
What's caused that injury?
Screwdriver?
No, granny.
That's he's on construction yard...
Do I look like a rounded foul?
All of you get killed...
for nothing...
It's not we, who are bad,
it's the life, that's bad.
The car is scary too.
Like a catafalc.
Hello! - Come, dear to the kitchen.

She is only one in our countryside.
Her mother is paralised here,
so he returned here from city...
So, got potatoes, come.
Will feed'ya.
What should we do, Cat?
Do you want to leave him?
Do you think it's better to make a band here.
Until everyone knows...
Look at them, they haven't seen
such car for life.
I bet there are rumors now already.
Also what's with those crazy truck drivers?
Do you think I want to leave him?
I don't understand.
Any proposals?
I am with everyone.
Where are you going? - Will go through,
look for spare tire.
If I only knew, I'd get one more spare...
Hey, stranger, hello!
Do you visit somebody?
'Brother' let's go for a drink.
I'm celebrating. End of army...
I am not your 'brother', you crazy?
Hey, you, go back.
Get back, I said!
You don't recognize me, bro?
Go to hell, get lost. I am busy.
Understand!
See you in hell, bastard.
Do you know what I have done with
likes of you in the army?
They washed my socks!
Understand?
Pashka, drunk again!
- What's wrong? I am celebrating!
I gave my blood for these morons...
What fucking blood?
You cooked for 2 years.
Just eating....Bitch!..Parasite...
What are you taking sunshine?
I think I made myself clear.
We have 'eating pause'. - We have
done with wallpapers...
Tomorrow buyer will come,
and it's not finished.
Why are yu nervous?
Can't take decision?
We have all visas.
What is linking you to this place?
Your 'brotherhood'?
What I will be doing there?
On gas station or garbage man?
I know only 'Grand Mercie' in French.
Nevertheless you know all criminal expressions.
How long do you think it you will be getting clean out of that?
I don't want to be your
jail visitor.
Or visit your grave.
- Don't say it, OK?
I am ashamed of guys.
looked like a traitor.
Nobody will let you free.
How's about your 'prestige'?
Your KILLA and 'BURNED-OUT' are closer
to you than myself...
Nastya. Why are you saying this?
I will take my own personal decision. - You lie!
I have heard million times.
I am leaving this...
Then your KILLA or BURNED OUT come...
and evrything starts again!
Nastya! Please. 
I think we decided everything.
I mean everything. It's not easy.
I like you very much, Katja.
Listen?
I gotta go.
My mom probably woke up.
Will go.
Katja, we have to fix some things...
but I'll come back...
Will you go with me?
Will you be back?
May be we should settle here.
Yeah, and take country-side names.
Rama will be TRUCKER-FUCKER...
I mean that's weird -
DOG WOMAN.
Do you think it's from name or surname?
Now think if you'd have the same name?
No I wouldn't. Cause DOG WOMAN is woman!
You'd be DOG-MAN.
Or just 'DOG'.
Do you know somethign about Dog Man?
Alright, Dog,

Ok, guys!
Dimon, why did you stand up?
I'm fine. Just taking a breath.

Pashka - Katya's ex boyfriend,
everytime asking me -"who are you".
I said:
''What's your business?''
And he's: ''I will call to my uncle -
to district centre - then you'll know"
He's a policeman.
He can. He's such jerk.
Stop! So...
Going to Katjka?

The owner of the cement will come in the morning.

How do you linked to him?
 - Nothing special, just passing by.

He owes us too. - This bastard framed whole damn city.
So, guys, stand in the cue, please!

And who should knew?
Sit here like rats.
What's your proposal?
Return there?
Now, Dimon, tell me!
How could we end up in such a shit from
such nonsence that started?
Look, who was your driving teacher?

Does she look's great?
OK this is shit,

One of these girls works in the computer
selling company...
She's got drunk and told us that they
get a shitload of cash by the end of week.
And one looser for a security.
How much money?
- Just think. Wholesale computer dealer.
I think by the end of the week
they'd get 100 thousands or so...
Looks fishy!
- Why fishy?
She's got drunk like a lie-detector.
Coul'd have asked anything.
Alright, Cat,
need to decide, today.
I got masks already.
Need another shootout?
Come on, Cat.
Who's we need to kill?
They are jerks.
We'll point guns at them - they'll shit
in their pants and give evrything.
Why did you so excited!
Listened to some shit from a drunk lady and 
lost your head already?
What is something happens to you?
Dimon will die here alone, or what?
What do you mean ''you''?
I don't understand.
You don't take part? Or did you called your
fucking lady and cleared situation for you...
Shut the fuck up, it's my own business!
It's not your fucking business, got that?
- We gave you a solid project.
Hands off me!
- Calm down.
Let's do that or let's split up.
- OK that's not me who said that
What the hell are you saying?
I don't need your shit, understand?
I will jump to my Boomer

Come on!
Alright guys.
Why did you started?
Do you go or stay with those loosers?
I see that you don't give a damn about me.
I won't stay here.
I will go with you.
Dimon, you'll stay here.
OK, we do this shit and get lost.
There's a manager with glasses.
One security guy, seems like without gun.
Secretary. Looks like the one you fucked all night.
There's safe near manager. Not serious.
Why do you need 3 guns?
Going to war?
