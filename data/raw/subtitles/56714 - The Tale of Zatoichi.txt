here you are.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Could you tell sukegoro that
ichi the blind man is here?
He's not in right now.
- When will he be back?
- In about an hour.
May i wait for him here?
Come this way.
Watch your step.
You're very kind.
This way.
Wait here.
That must be apricot blossoms.
It stinks in here.
- What did you say?
- What stinks?
It smells like sweat and filth.
You must all share this room.
Hold your nose if it stinks.
Excuse me, may i join the game?
May i deal?
You're blind.
Sure you can manage?
I've had some experience.
All right, then.
Here's the cup.
Forgive me if being blind
makes me a little clumsy.
Place your bets.
He knows how to deal.
Look at this.
I'm betting on even.
- So am i.
- Me too.
Is nobody betting on odd?
Anybody for odd?
How much are the bets?
300, 425, 200, 250 and 150,
all on even.
A total of 1,325 mon.
Not too shabby.
Five and one makes even!
- Even?
- Five and one.
Even.
Dealer pays 170 mon.
I have more money, see?
I have more here.
Go ahead, make your bets.
Ready?
Here we go.
Place your bets.
I'm betting big on odd.
Me too.
Everyone's betting on odd this time?
No one's betting on even?
No one.
- No more bets then?
- No.
How careless of me.
They must have slipped from my sleeve.
Hey, what are you...
what is it?
It's even, isn't it?
Looks like i got lucky.
Thank you very much.
Something's fishy here.
Why? It was even, wasn't it?
What about the dice in your sleeve?
Here they are.
- You cheated!
- Who, me?
He's a cheat.
You put the real dice in your sleeve!
Yeah, you put the real ones
in your sleeve.
You blind cheater!
You mean you placed your bets
on the dice
that weren't in the cup?
Don't you know
the rules of the game?
You bet on the dice in the cup.
Isn't that right?
You tricked us!
Idiots!
Don't take me for a fool
just because i'm blind.
Is lioka full of filthy money-grubbers
like you?
No wonder it stinks here.
I don't think
your boss is worth waiting for.
I don't care to see him anymore.
So long.
Damn that blind bastard!
- He took all our money.
- That son of a bitch!
What do we do?
We better shut him up
before he blabbers about this.
- I'll go after him.
- Me too.
Let tame and tate go alone.
He's just a blind guy, after all.
- Let's go out the back.
- Right.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere, boss.
Boss, you're back.
Welcome home, boss.
Hey, you're ichi!
Sukegoro, hello.
Welcome to...
bring a basin
to wash this man's feet!
Right away.
Tate, take off his sandals.
Sit over here.
Traveling alone must be hard
when you're blind.
It's good to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Masa, this is zatoichi.
When i went to the temple
at nikko last year,
i stopped by my comrade's place
and that's where i first met ichi.
Is that right?
You told me to stop in
if i passed this way.
That's right,
and i'm glad you did.
Ichi may be blind,
but he's such a skilled swordsman
that his opponents shake
just to see him draw his sword.
Please don't exaggerate.
I've witnessed his skill.
There was just a flash
and a bottle was sliced in two.
You couldn't even see his sword.
All you heard was the sound of it
returning to its sheath.
Please stop.
It's the truth.
- We'd like to see that demonstration.
- You should.
Please.
You can stay for a while, right?
Thank you very much.
Is there a way for me to make
a little money around here?
Let me think about it.
Thank you.
Tate.
- Boss, hanji is coming tonight.
- Tonight?
He's bringing his wife,
so i'll arrange dinner for her too.
Tate, you'll take care of this man
during his stay here.
Prepare his bedding and meals
and wash his loincloth as well.
This is tate.
Use him as you will.
He's an honest man.
You can trust him.
Thank you.
A trustworthy man is a good man.
Nice to meet you, tate.
Pleased to meet you.
You're pretty good at this.
Good to see you.
I've been waiting for you.
Thank you.
Hanji is still young,
and yet he's your boss's sworn brother?
His wife was the governor's mistress.
The governor let him
marry his mistress?
Yes, he's a lucky man.
He actually married
the governor's mistress?
That's right.
You have a beautiful wife, hanji.
The governor was very good to you.
Yes, very good.
Now you have a strong connection
with the governor.
You have nothing to fear anymore.
I wish i were so lucky.
What are you saying?
He'll protect you just as well.
- Isn't that so?
- Yes.
The governor knows
you're like brothers.
That's reassuring.
I feel a lot better.
Did you know a renowned samurai
is staying in sasagawa?
- No.
- He's from edo.
Shigezo must be planning something
to have such a samurai around.
He's preparing to make a move
against me.
The sooner the better.
I have a queer bird
staying with me too.
Have ichi come in.
He can entertain us
with his sword tricks.
Who is this fellow?
A blind man
who used to be a masseur.
He handles a sword better
than most men who can see.
Once you witness his skill,
you'd never go against him.
He's amazing.
Sorry. I'm not in the mood tonight.
Please excuse me.
Just come introduce yourself, then.
You'll have to excuse me from that too.
I'm just getting relaxed.
It feels so good.
Forgive me for being so selfish.
If you say so.
My skill is not for entertainment.
Especially not for a guy like hanji.
Right, tate?
He's not in the mood?
That ungrateful blind wretch!
What's he doing?
Tate is giving him a massage.
A blind masseur getting
a massage from a seeing man?
That's funny!
Tate, is someone here?
It's my sister.
- What do you want?
- I have something to tell you.
You fool.
Why did you come here?
I'm all right now. You can go.
Stupid girl.
What are you going to do
about saki?
Not so loud.
Scared someone will hear us?
You took advantage of a nice girl
and got her pregnant.
That's none of your business.
Then be a man and go see her.
- Leave me alone.
- No, i won't.
- What are you going to do?
- Keep it down.
The poor girl is beginning to show.
She's scared her family will find out.
I didn't ask her to get pregnant.
It's her own fault.
How can you say that?
You just used her.
Now you're dropping her
because she's pregnant.
I didn't think
you were such a coward.
You're a monster!
Say what you like.
I'll go see her.
I'll do the right thing.
I don't believe you.
I will go see her.
You're just saying that.
Don't be so mistrusting.
By the way, what are you going to do
about seisuke?
Don't change the subject.
Go back to him.
He's begging you.
He says he can't forget you.
I'd rather be kicked and beaten to death
than go back to that man!
I'll never be the wife of a gangster
ever again.
So you say.
I feel sorry for saki that she ever
got involved with you,
but she was a fool
to trust a gangster like you.
So when are you going to see her?
I don't know. I'm very busy.
More excuses. I knew it.
I'm going to tell father about this.
Wait a minute!
Tane, wait!
Was tane here?
Did she come to see you?
I promise i'll get her back for you.
Just give me a little more time.
- Are you sure?
- Leave it to me.
Your sister's name is tane?
Did you hear us talking?
You called out her name
quite loudly.
Oh, right.
Is there a place to fish nearby?
There's a small lake.
Then i can fish for carp.
Any luck?
Not even one yet.
I see.
It's a nice spring day.
Do you come here often?
I've nothing to do but fish.
I envy you.
You have a problem with your eyes?
- I'm blind.
- I'm sorry.
There's a tug on your line.
A small carp.
That was fast.
At this rate
there'll be no fish left for me.
How did you know my bobber
was moving if you can't see?
- I just sensed it.
- You sensed it?
They just stole my bait.
- What do you do?
- Me?
I'm just a lowly gangster.
With which gang?
I'm not from here.
I just arrived in lioka yesterday
for a short stay.
I'm staying in sasagawa.
I lost everything in edo
and ended up here.
You're from edo.
Yes, a failure from edo.
Excuse me, but are you ill?
Me?
Yes.
I don't feel sick. Why?
I'm sorry.
Please forget what i said.
Forgive me if i've offended you.
Place your bets.
- Even.
- Odd.
No more bets.
- The food is here.
- Over here.
Here we are.
It smells like oden.
There's a restaurant in here.
Then i'll try it later.
I have some business to take care of.
I'll come back for you in an hour.
- All right.
- See you later.
Brother!
Father wants to talk to you.
- Did you tell him about saki?
- Yes, i did.
You fool! You'll be sorry.
Wait!
Tate!
Tate was outside, but he ran off.
Ran off?
- I told him you wanted to talk to him.
- Coward.
He's spineless.
Are you open?
Come in.
This way.
What will you have?
Whatever smells so delicious.
You're blind.
Where did you come from?
- I'm staying at sukegoro's.
- I see.
You are tate's father.
Yes.
He didn't mention anything
about his father being here.
Is that so?
Here you are.
Thank you.
You've got it all wrong!
I was watching you.
You lying bastard.
You won't talk your way
out of this.
Out with it!
You're stealing away gambling clients
for sasagawa.
- Please spare me.
- I knew it!
Go back and tell your boss:
If he wants my business,
he'll have to fight me for it.
I'll take him on anytime.
- Did you get that?
- Yes.
Be sure to give him the message.
There might be a war with them soon.
It doesn't look good.
What happened?
One of sasagawa's spies
was in the house.
They sneak into other gambling joints
and try to steal customers.
They get two or three bu
per customer.
Don't the lioka and sasagawa gangs
get along?
There are run-ins often these days.
Hey, beautiful,
another one, please.
It's not good for you
to drink so much.
You should take care
of your health.
You know you'll start coughing.
Stop nagging and hurry up.
You don't know
when to stop drinking.
Don't bother warming it up.
What a fright you gave me!
See? I told you so.
What are you doing in the kitchen?
Boss.
You shouldn't be drinking
in a place like this.
There are better rooms to drink in.
- You should know better too.
- It's not her fault.
I chose to sit here.
- Where is the sake?
- Right away.
You must regret
having taken in a drunk like me.
I hope you will be staying with us.
You want me to stay?
Yes, by all means.
Why do you want someone around
who does nothing but drink?
I'll need your help
when the war starts.
I'm counting on you.
So there is to be a war.
It might come to that.
I won't use my sword to kill people.
I told you that
at our first meeting.
Here's your sake.
You did tell me that,
but to be honest,
you're our only hope
when we go up
against sukegoro in lioka.
Against sukegoro?
I'm sure magojiro, jinzo, and hanji
would bring
ten to twenty men each
if i asked for help.
But why bother them
when we're dealing
with a little fly like shigezo?
Sasagawa doesn't even have
half the men we do.
That's right.
They don't stand a chance against us.
But shigezo's lost his head.
He's like a blind man
wandering into a snake pit.
Should you be talking
about a "blind man," boss?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
What's he doing?
He's lying down.
- Sleeping?
- Just dozing.
I guess it's not enough
that his eyes are closed all day long!
Damn it, that's hot!
Damn it! Tate!
- He's not here.
- Where did he go?
Does anybody know?
What a useless lot.
Can we count on ichi
if war breaks out?
Of course. That's why
we're letting him freeload.
By the way,
that samurai from edo...
the one staying in sasagawa?
It'll be a sight to see
him and ichi go at each other.
Is ichi really that great
with the sword?
You're the only one who's seen his skill,
and i know you were impressed.
But he's just a blind man.
He can't be all that great.
Now just a minute.
I can't let that pass.
Ichi, were you there all this time?
Yes, i heard every word.
Masa, you said i was just a blind man.
Well, l...
as far as i'm concerned,
whether you call me
blind or crippled,
i won't object
because it's the truth.
But i won't allow people
to look down on me
just because i'm blind.
Just what are you saying?
I don't want
to bore you with my story,
but i was a legitimate masseur
until just three years ago.
I was treated with scorn often enough
back in those days.
But i never let it bring me to tears,
no matter how it upset me.
I took up sword training
so people like you who can see
would treat me with respect.
A blind man can achieve some status
as an acupuncture master
or a musician.
But that wasn't what i wanted.
And that won't impress
people like you.
Masa, you're not blind like i am,
but can you do this?
Sukegoro,
you said it would be a sight
to see a match between me
and sasagawa's samurai.
But let me tell you:
My life doesn't come cheap.
That insolent bastard!
I'll go and apologize.
Don't bother.
We can't let him have the upper hand.
Ichi.
You just shocked the living daylights
out of my men.
Being able to see is
almost a handicap
after a display like that.
Here, take this.
What's that?
I want you to help me.
- Please.
- So my help is worth three ryo.
Right. That's not a bad offer.
I'm putting my life on the line.
Do you think that's only worth
three ryo?
- Are you saying that's not enough?
- No, i don't mean that.
You've been very kind to me,
but i'm planning to leave
tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning?
Thank you for letting me stay here.
Here, i'll return this to you.
What if i give you five ryo?
Five ryo.
I really want to leave
tomorrow morning.
How about eight?
It's not the money,
but if you insist,
you make it hard for me to leave.
All right.
I'll stay for another
two or three days.
The balance will be paid after the war,
all right?
- Then this three ryo is an advance?
- That's right.
Don't forget about the rest.
I won't!
All right, then.
I was out on an errand for the boss.
He was just looking for you.
For me?
What's the matter?
You seem flustered.
You've been up to something.
I smell a woman.
- You had a quarrel with your woman?
- No, i didn't.
I didn't see any woman.
I just went on an errand.
I swear i didn't see any woman.
There's a dead body!
What happened?
Ayoung woman,
floating dead in the water.
What is it?
- Saki is dead.
- What?
Dead?
She threw herself into the lake.
You killed her.
No! I didn't do it!
I don't know anything about it.
Even if you didn't actually kill her,
you're responsible for her death.
Well, if you put it that way.
If you had just talked to her,
she wouldn't have killed herself.
She died blaming you, you know.
When was her body found?
Just now, floating in the lake.
Don't tell anyone she was pregnant
with my child.
I'm begging you.
Tate,
i'm going out.
You're here already.
A body was found
floating here this morning.
A body?
A carpenter's daughter.
Suicide?
It may have been suicide
or an accident,
or she may have died
at someone's hand.
I see.
So no more killing today.
Not even fish.
I agree.
Do you drink?
I won't say i don't.
How about drinking with me
to the memory of the dead girl?
I hear sasagawa and lioka
might go to war one of these days.
So i hear.
We'd be on opposite sides then.
I've wanted to fight you,
but not for the sake
of some meaningless war.
Fight me?
You must be joking.
Fight a blind man like me?
You suspected i was ill
when we first met.
Indeed, i have consumption.
You must have noticed
something in the way i breathe.
I attribute your astuteness
to your skill with the sword.
The muscle on your right shoulder is
proof of an uncommon degree of training.
You drove yourself with exceptional
dedication to acquire your skill.
Isn't that true?
Not at all.
Would you allow me?
Bear with me.
I'm out of practice.
To tell you the truth,
i did practice a bit on my own.
But i never received formal training.
What i do is no different
than the tricks
street vendors use
to attract customers.
You don't fool me.
There's an almost menacing intensity
emanating from you.
Try as you might,
you can't hide it.
Enough about me.
You don't look like the sort of man
to come to a place like this.
It's my own doing
that i ended up here.
Shigezo just happened
to take me in.
My illness will
claim my life before long.
Don't be so gloomy.
That's enough. Thank you.
- That was great.
- Thank you.
You and i are both alone
in this world,
but you face the harsh world bravely.
I'm just the opposite.
Let's stop this depressing talk.
Let's drink.
Master hirate,
boss shigezo is here.
Drinking with a priest?
- Accept this offering of sake.
- Thank you.
Why, you're a masseur.
You need a better drinking partner
now that you're staying in this temple.
- I should hire a woman for you.
- That's right.
Did you come to speak to me?
I wanted to talk things out
with you tonight.
- About what?
- About the war with lioka.
You are really going to do it?
I can't back down now,
and if i fight them,
i have to crush them completely.
So i came to ask for your help.
I should go now.
I'm afraid i can't ask you to stay
for this meeting,
but i was enjoying our talk.
Thank you for the drink.
Excuse me.
Be careful.
It's pitch-black outside.
Thank you.
I'll send the boy along
to guide you.
That cane has a sword in it.
That's no masseur.
Strange fellow.
I enjoyed talking with you.
I hope to see you again.
Yes, i'd like to talk to you
again sometime too.
- Let's meet again.
- By all means.
Please take care of your health.
- You too.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Who was that?
His name is ichi.
He's staying in lioka.
What? In lioka!
Why didn't you tell me?
I shouldn't have said anything
in front of him.
- I'll go after him.
- Do that.
He might leak everything to sukegoro.
Leave him alone or you'll be sorry.
What's he going to do?
Why didn't you tell me
he's with sukegoro?
Shall we go watch?
Let's wait here.
They'll be back soon.
I'm going.
Thank you.
You go back now, and be careful.
Here's the lantern.
Thanks. You go on now.
Okay.
I hear you're staying in lioka.
That's right.
It's dangerous to walk
with drawn swords, you know.
We can't let you live
after what you just heard.
It's not my fault that you talked.
Too bad you weren't deaf
instead of blind.
I'll put up a fight.
There, now it's pitch-black.
That makes it even.
Come on if you're ready.
Who is that man?
Just a blind man,
as you can see.
Impressive!
You're back.
Where have you been?
You said you were going fishing
hours ago. I was worried.
Afraid i might have fallen
into the lake?
Boss, you mustn't blame ichi.
Your men attacked him.
But he's with sukegoro.
Priest, you go on ahead.
I need to speak with him.
Then i'll leave this lantern with you.
Good-bye.
Master hirate,
please help me, i beg of you.
I'm counting on you.
Your presence
will boost my men's morale.
Gangsters like us aren't really
very skilled with the sword.
But even if there were 200 of them,
for you it would be
like slicing potatoes.
I beg you.
Lioka has ichi.
I'll take care of him.
You?
- I'll use a rifle.
- A rifle.
It'll be our secret weapon,
so keep it to yourself.
Thank you.
That feels good.
Would you run an errand for me?
Where to?
- You know thejoshoji temple?
- Yes.
A samurai named hirate
is staying there.
He treated me to quite a bit of sake
last night.
I want you to deliver
three bottles of good sake to him.
Certainly.
How much is one bottle
of the best sake?
Two hundred eighty mon.
Two hundred eighty mon.
So three bottles would be
840 mon.
Here.
I should get 160 mon in change.
Three bottles of the best sake.
And my change should be 160 mon.
Two bottles' worth of cheap sake.
Two bottles' worth?
Keep the change.
- Deliver it to the temple.
- I will.
Is there a master hirate here?
Yeah. What do you want?
I've come from lioka.
Lioka?
What business do you have here?
This is from zatoichi.
You bastard!
- What is it?
- What's wrong with you?
- A d-d-dead body!
- Who is it?
I don't know.
He's lying faceup on the mat.
It's inosuke!
- He's cold already.
- Who did this?
There are no sword marks,
but he's swollen from beating.
He was beaten to death.
Sasagawa's behind this.
- Look at this.
- What about it?
These are sasa, bamboo leaves.
So it's a message from sasagawa.
They're challenging us to war
by bringing the body in here.
Sukegoro must be in shock by now.
- Will he make a move?
- We'll see.
They have a large gang.
We'd better be prepared.
But we have master hirate.
Listen, you've heard about how
mataemon araki
single-handedly killed 37 men?
I'm sure master hirate can handle
at least 30 men by himself.
- Don't you think so?
- You are right.
Boss!
Something's happened
to master hirate!
- He coughed up blood and passed out.
- What?
The boy from the temple came
to tell you.
Turn him so his head faces north.
- Quick!
- Get a pillow.
Over here.
- We can sneak out now.
- Are we still going?
Of course. With your father busy
in there, it's our only chance.
Right.
Did anyone see inosuke go out?
No.
You have no idea where he went?
You were talking to him earlier
in the kitchen.
I don't know anything.
Inosuke was the first person
i spoke with in lioka.
Poor fellow.
Well, thank you, and good-bye.
Good-bye.
Maybe it was in retaliation
for last night.
He must have left this.
She's still here.
Why are you here at this hour?
Seisuke is with me.
What are you going to do
about him?
Something might happen
if you don't give him an answer tonight.
I told you i'm not going back to him!
- That's not what he wants to hear.
- So what?
- Go back to him.
- Absolutely not.
Come on, tane.
He says he can't forget you.
He's in love with you.
Have a heart.
I'm closing up now, so get out.
Depending on your answer,
things could turn out badly tonight.
What do you mean?
You could get killed.
Oh, really?
Fool!
I want to talk to you.
I have nothing to say.
I'll change my ways.
Tane, please.
I'll leave you two alone.
Why don't you talk inside?
You're leaving?
Come here.
Thanks.
Listen to what seisuke has to say.
It's for your own good.
- I'm leaving too.
- Not so fast.
I'll never let you go.
Stop!
I'll change. I'm begging you.
Stop. You're hurting me.
Come back to me, tane.
No, let me go!
Come back, please!
- Say you'll come back!
- You're going to kill me?
If you won't come back to me,
i'll scar your face.
I'll scar your whole body
so you can't go out in public.
Ichi!
I left something behind.
You shouldn't walk alone at night.
It's not safe.
I'll walk you home.
Is someone there?
I guess not.
My father says
you're not like other gangsters.
Is that so?
Masa says
you're amazing with a sword.
Being good at fighting
and killing people
is nothing to brag about.
If there is a war with sasagawa,
i suppose you'll have to fight too.
I thought so at first,
but now i'm trying to find a way
to get out of it.
You don't have a lantern,
so watch your step.
I'm all right.
The moon just came out,
so i can see fine.
You must be very pretty.
Suddenly i wish
i could see your face.
Whether the sun is shining
or the moon is overhead,
it's always dark for me,
and i usually don't care.
But at this moment
i wish i could see your face.
I'm not pretty at all.
You must be pretty.
I can tell just by talking to you.
Feel my face with your hands.
You have a mole here.
I wonder if it's a lucky mole.
I have one just like it.
They say it means
i'll have lots of children.
It's a lucky mole.
What would i do
with so many children?
Just don't raise them
to be gangsters.
I won't.
But why do you say that?
Because to be a gangster
is a foolish way to live.
Then why don't you live
a decent life?
It's like being stuck in a bog.
It's not easy to pull yourself out
once you've fallen in.
I'm stuck living this life
that you hate so much.
Call masa for me.
You're back.
Deliver a letter of challenge
to sasagawa.
The samurai from edo fell ill.
We can't miss this chance.
He coughed up blood and collapsed.
With him out of the picture,
we can defeat them easily.
We'll get the boats out
once you deliver the letter.
Got it.
- Tell the men to get ready.
- Right away.
Ichi.
We're going to attack sasagawa.
You're coming with us, aren't you?
So it's come to that.
It's to avenge inosuke's death.
I see.
I gave you three ryo before.
Yes, with five more to be paid later.
It looks like i won't need to pay you
that five ryo.
It seems we can win this war
without your help.
Then i don't have to take part.
But i already paid you three ryo.
- That advance cannot be returned.
- What?
Besides,
don't you think having a blind man
like me help you
would tarnish the reputation
of the lioka gang?
You've been planning all along
to get out of this.
You came here
just to freeload off me.
You thieving blind bastard!
I don't need you anymore.
Get out!
- How many men do we have?
- About 60.
Ichi, it's me.
Tane?
Thank you for last night.
The war is really going
to take place.
So it seems.
Are you going too?
No, i don't have to.
I brought you something to eat.
It smells good.
What are you doing here?
Bringing food to him?
Don't!
Ichi, i hear you're running away
now that the war is starting.
Coward!
Sasagawa's samurai is
coughing up blood, so he's out too.
We don't need you anymore.
The boss wants you
to clear out this minute!
Master hirate coughed up blood.
Thank you.
They smell nice.
They must have found out
that master hirate is ill.
Sukegoro's men are coming
in six boats.
Six boats?
That means 50 or 60 men.
- Twice as many as we have.
- Each of us will have to take on two men.
We can't fight them head-on.
Let's trap them in the settlement
by the river.
Like you said, we don't stand a chance
if we go head-on.
But we know the maze
of the river settlement
like our own backyard.
Sukegoro's men will be in
for a big surprise.
That's a good idea.
Get the rifle and come with me.
Where are you going?
I'm going to get master hirate
to join the fight.
Boss shigezo is here.
How do you feel?
You're dressed for war.
We are going to fight sukegoro.
I just came to let you know
what's happening.
He heard about your condition
and wasted no time in challenging us.
We can't back down now.
We'll just have to do our best.
Please take care.
- Shigezo.
- Yes?
Are you going to use that rifle?
Yes, it will take your place.
It's all i have to rely on.
I'll kill that blind bastard.
That's not fair.
I'm going to get up.
I'm feeling better today.
I can do my part.
So don't use the rifle.
Are you sure?
Get me my kimono.
- Boss.
- Yes?
Leave the rifle here.
All right.
Master ichi.
I heard that master hirate is ill.
How is he?
He went to help sasagawa.
What?
Shigezo told him he was going
to shoot you with his rifle.
Master hirate said he'd fight
so shigezo wouldn't use the rifle.
He thanked me
and gave me this as he left.
He's prepared to die.
Ichi, where are you going?
Take me with you.
Don't talk such nonsense.
I'll follow you anywhere.
Please take me with you.
I appreciate you saying that,
but i don't even have
a place to live.
And i'm blind besides.
I'll be your cane.
I'll endure hardship for you
as long as i live.
You're the man i love.
Ayoung woman like you
shouldn't be guiding a blind man.
People will laugh at you.
I don't mind.
Let me come with you.
Stop it.
I must go see master hirate.
Let's go.
I'll be waiting for you
on the main road.
I'll be waiting.
Are those shigezo's men?
- They're running away!
- They're scared!
Shigezo will beg for mercy
before he even draws his sword.
You may be right.
Open the door!
- Sasagawa's samurai is here.
- What?
- That's him there.
- That's strange.
The blind man isn't here.
That can't be.
Back up.
Damn it!
I shouldn't have let ichi go so easily.
Is he all right?
He'll have to do more than that
to earn his keep.
- He doesn't look good.
- Who cares how he looks?
Let him do his job.
We have to go after sukegoro.
Boss, be careful.
Tate, you stick with me.
Zatoichi.
I've been waiting for you.
Master hirate,
you are sick.
You shouldn't be out here.
That is not your concern.
This is foolish.
Never mind. Come on.
I want a match with you before i die.
Master hirate, please.
Don't you want to see my skill?
If i fight you,
i won't let you win easily.
Of course not.
The rest of you, don't interfere.
Magnificent!
Rather than getting killed
by scoundrels,
i wanted to die at your hands.
Ichi, you did it.
He killed the samurai.
Kill shigezo!
I knew it would turn out like this.
Shigezo didn't have a chance
against me.
Thank you for your help.
It looks like i'll be
second in command now,
now that masa and seisuke
have been killed.
I really appreciate your help.
Lioka is solid as a rock now.
What a happy
and wonderful occasion.
Join me for a drink.
Fool!
Your men are lying dead
in the boats.
They died for no reason.
What's so happy
and wonderful about that?
We gangsters are outlaws,
shunned by society.
That's why we have
to honor our own code.
But you act
like you have the right
to raise your face to the sun
without shame.
You fool!
Use this to give master hirate
a proper burial.
I'll return in a year
to pay my respects at his grave.
As for this sword,
i don't want to carry
the painful memory with me.
Bury it with him.
Good-bye.
Probably just some worthless nobody.
The end
