It wasn't meant to be this way.
You know?
We make our plans, sure.
But life...
Life
is what happens to you along the way.
You know, at first,
I didn't want this.
I didn't want to connect.
I didn't want to get involved.
And she kept on at me.
You know?
"This is what life is.
This is why we're here, lo connect.'
"To build."
“We're here to build something."
And then we had Theo.
And then I understood
that she was right.
We're not meant to be alone.
You know what she said to me?
She said
that even the most damaged heart...
can be mended.
Even the most damaged heart.
Yeah.
No, I'm with Vic.
What?
I can't let you in
until Alphonse is home.
Alphonse is on his way.
Where?
In the basement.
Paulie.
No.
It's Paul.
Go.
719... Now you realize.
719... Now you realize.
What?
What the fuck?
This shit is crazy.
Now he's killing us.
Call the locksmith.
And get that asshole
from the alarm company over here.
“Now you realize.”
I know who's doing this to me.
What?
Killed for less.
A little uncouth
to come without a call.
There's a better place
for you to be.
Get out.
Go!
Am I gonna gel paid?
Have you seen this man?
Paul?
- Everyone knows Paul's missing.
- I want you to think before you answer.
Cause I'm getting
to the bottom of this.
The bottom of what?
Three months of letters.
Three months of torment.
Not being able to leave my house
without wondering...
if some coward
is gonna sneak up behind me and."...
Paul was looking into this.
And I think he found exactly
what he was looking for.
But before he could come
and tell me...
my friend Paul
shows up strangled in my freezer.
You've got a lot of enemies,
don't you, Alphonse?
Three months ago
you and I had our disagreement!
I raised my lake to 25 %...
to allow you to continue
to operate in my buildings.
I started getting letters
three months ago!
That's no fucking coincidence!
That's not fucking accurate!
You asked for 30 percent,
and Lon told you...
you could only ask me for 20-.
So if anyone was bent out of shape,
it was you, Alphonse.
Who's in this picture?
I don't fucking know.
- Who is in this picture?
- I don't know!
What am I supposed to realize?
What does 719 mean?
What am I going to fucking realize?
What am I gonna fucking realize?
Darcy,
want to give me a hand there, mate?
- He ain't got shit to do with this!
- He's fucking lying so you shut the fuck up.
I've been picking up
from Harry for over a year.
He's fucking lying
so you shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna ask you again.
What am I supposed to realize?
I don't care
what you think I've done to you...
you are not sanctioned to kill me.
That much I do fucking know.
So it's not on,
you even coming here!
Not on?
The term is not cool.
You fucking English.
You always do shit like that.
That's our system.
And you also
make your sevens like this.
You...
are not sanctioned...
to kill me.
Fuck it.
What the fuck y'all wailing for?
Do it.
Fuck, you've been hit.
Don't worry about it.
A bit better this time.
Will you be all right
to drive yourself home, Beatrice?
You're supposed to lie down
and relax.
I was relaxing so much
I saw a white light.
Well, if you see it again,
don't walk into it.
I still have a lot of things to take out
on you for my childhood.
Beautiful.
I love the color.
It's very PFEW-
I'll run your bath.
Hi, it's your neighbor who waves...
Hello?
Hello?
I got your note.
Hi.
Hi.
I wasn't sure that you got it.
I was wondering
if I put it in the wrong box?
No.
No. It's mine.
So...
The note.
I just thought since we...
I thought it would be nice
lo finally meet you.
Beatrice.
Victor.
No, thanks.
You don't talk a lot.
Not much, no.
It's okay.
I talk enough for both of us.
I talk too much.
Everybody says so.
You speak French?
I'd like lo.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
Another language?
Hungarian.
You're Hungarian?
You don't have an accent.
I worked very hard
lo gel rid of it.
So.
A job.
I'm, uh.-.
Right now
I'm dabbling in real estate.
The people I work
for buy buildings in need of renovation.
Fix them up and run them.
You?
A job?
Yeah.
I was involved
in a car accident last year.
I was a beautician before.
They rebuilt part of my face.
It's kind of hard
to give advice on beauty.
And, uh...
I have to smile a lot
in my job.
Most of the time,
it hurts to smile.
I don't get to smile
so much in my work.
- No?
- No.
Maybe you
and I should switch jobs.
Yeah.
So, what else?
I swear sometimes.
Especially when I drink.
Me, too.
Fuck.
Shit.
Careful.
You're smiling.
Tonight it's worth it.
I want lo take you somewhere.
So where are we going?
Are we going lo a club?
No.
No?
Very cold.
Very cold.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, then are we going to a park?
Warmer.
I thought you talk a lot?
I thought you don't?
Must be the company.
Usually, I don't.
You can turn here.
Pull over.
Just there.
You're afraid
I'll think you came tonight...
because you felt sorry for me.
You don't have to play
these games, Victor.
I know why you really came.
You're just being careful.
You wanted to find out...
if the girl who's been watching you
saw what you did.
I saw you...
kill this man.
I saw you strangle him.
I saw you lake him away.
Now you're trying to clean up a mess
that cannot be cleaned up.
But, I...
I think your secret
will be safe with me.
This is the man...
who hit my car
when he was drunk.
This is the man
who did this lo me.
I want you to kill him.
As you did with the man
in your apartment.
- Wait a minute.
- No.
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and tell them what I saw.
What the fuck are you...?
His BMW.
It's fixed.
This has never happened.
I can't be fixed.
He sewed three weeks.
Three weeks for what he did lo me.
Stupid Judge,
he sat there and looked at my face.
I want it done.
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and I'll tell them what I saw.
You'll do it!
You want to save yourself?
Do it!
Fuck!
He didn't pay-
I understand.
He didn't pay-
Slop saying that!
I understand!
Are you gonna do it?
What I did it
has nothing to do with you.
You have to do this!
He ruined my life.
I have nothing.
I am nothing.
I want it done
as soon as possible.
Then I will forget.
I will begin my life.
And I will forget
I that ever met you.
- Do you know what it is to kill a man!
- And I will forget I that ever met you.
It's not a bug! It's not a rat!
I would never kill a bug or a rat!
He's much worse
than these things!
You don't know
what you're getting into with me!
You've no fucking idea!
I could have called the police.
I saved your life.
Now you're gonna give me back mine.
If you're not going to kill me
you don't have a choice-.
Beatrice.
Laszlo.
Sorry I'm late.
You look good.
It's good to see you.
Were you worried
I was going to forget your name.
Convention.
You forget what it's like.
It's Andras who gave us
the body for your grave.
Whose body?
Someone who deserved it,
I'm sure.
We met.
Two days after
when they left you for dead.
Yeah.
Soviet modified Dragunov.
7.62 by 5.4 rounds.
With Russian PSO scopes.
Comes with bayonet
suppressor as well.
Heavier than I expected.
I'll take it.
Okay. All set.
What did he say?
Andras?
For 14 months
you've infiltrated Alphonse.
They wanted to know
why you've been waiting so long...
to do what needs to be done.
He said if he was lucky enough
lo be standing,like you are...
he'd want revenge too.
But we're all worried
you wait loo long.
Always kill the devil quickly
when you find him.
That was his advice.
I said you wanted to be close enough
to watch him suffer.
But I really don't know
the reason you're wailing.
So now say it in English for me.
I... lied
Yes?
I... tied... my shoe.
Today.
You tied what?
My shoe.
Your shoe?
Bigger smile than that.
That's not
the biggest smile you have.
What have I done to you?
Where have you taken me?
I need foodstuffs.
I can help you.
If you let me go,
he will spare you.
My brother
will not stop looking for me.
And he will find you.
Even if you get his money...
even if they pay...
he will find you.
You don't know
who you're messing with!
He will kill you!
He will kill you!
Monster's here.
Monster!
Hey, monster...
if you put a bag on your head
we might hook up with you.
MONSTER
You have to take off
your shoes.
My morn
likes lo keep the floor clean.
How long will it take?
Long enough lo be prepared.
You say he goes to this bar...
every night.
Yeah.
You know where he works?
He's looking for work.
As much as I could find out, I did.
I never thought about it before.
Revenge.
When I saw you
kill that man in your apartment...
I knew I had my answer.
Why did you do it?
I just want to know more
about you.
I'm not here by choice.
We have company.
She can't hear us.
She lost most of her hearing as a child.
I'm looking
for my hearing aids.
Hello.
Nice lo meet you.
Nice lo meet you.
Well. Very good.
You want to stay for lunch.
We're having chicken.
Lemon chicken. It's very good.
And cookies.
We love cookies
in this house.
You want a cookie?
I can't stay.
I want lo show you something.
Pictures of Beatrice.
You can see
she has excellent genes.
You see
how beautiful she is?
I want it done
as soon as possible.
Mama“.
Victor has to go.
Au revoir, Victor.
It was nice meeting you.
You'll hear from me
when it's done.
Cookies.
It's for you.
Take them.
A bit gfllmPY-
Crackerjack.
Got any grass?
That depends.
Information is power,
my friend.
You see anyone
take a photo up here?
Already told.
Already told who?
Another guy.
A guy like you.
This is my friend, Paul.
Did you tell him?
Hello. Alphonse?
You know,
people are ﬂipping out.
You weren't sanctioned to do Harry.
or his men.
Or leave a house
full of dead Jamaicans!
- No, I told you... Look, Lon...
- Try to imagine...
Can you imagine
what the fuck I'm dealing with?
No.
You need to come
and see me right now.
You don't appreciate
the severity of this.
You come now.
I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.
So...
We got dead Jamaicans?
I'm listening.
Well, Lon.
For the last three months,
Harry was messing with me.
Trying to freak me out.
Sending little notes like this.
With pictures and threats,
and fucked up shit.
719, Now you Realize...
I don't think he was too happy
with the percentage deal.
Okay.
I went in there to gel answers...
not dead Jamaicans.
Turned out that way.
I lost two guys.
And truth is, I could
have been just as dead as both of them.
You know Joe Bragg?
And Herbert?
Lowell Khan.
And Weinberg?
They're my colleagues.
Yeah.
Each...
received photos like these.
Yeah?
Yo, Vic.
Where're you at?
I'm in the middle of something.
Hey, listen, I was right.
Alphonse is still in danger-.
It's not Harry
and his men doing this shit.
How do you know that?
You know Cafe Cora?
Can you get there?
I can find it.
Alphonse
is there with Lon Gordon.
I'm gonna call the rest of the crew
and get them down there.
How'd you know it wasn't Harry?
I'll be there in five.
Fuck.
Yo, Terry.
Yeah?
I'm gonna look at these photos
another way.
Cause whoever's doing this
ls taking it seriously enough now...
lo let us know
that loans to you are not secure.
That's respect enough
to let us know his intentions.
You're not gonna be around.
You may not be around to collect.
Lon, that's exactly
what Harry wanted you lo think.
I got a note too.
This morning.
It's addressed to you.
Englishmen and Jamaicans,
they don't send notes like this.
Not after they've been killed...
in their own house.
719, now you realize I It's not the 7
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
And this key...
was taped to it.
You know what that key is for?
I want you lo get the books
and deeds together for me now.
Fine.
Every building you owe us for.
You understand this,
don't you?
So the uptown buildings,
you're pulling out of the deal.
We're not pulling out.
You're just in no condition
right now to pull in.
Shit!
- Alphonse...
- Not right now.
There's a problem.
We need to go.
UNKNOWN
Did you get the key
He's here.
What?
On, shit!
- Get down!
- Shit!
Jesus!
Get down!
Darcy!
He's up on the roof!
Get in the car!
Up there!
9°, Q9, go, go!
Get the fuck out of here!
Luco!
You watch the elevator!
Yeah!
Dolph and Charles
come upstairs!
Kilroy, back stairs with me!
Now!
Darcy,
he got out from the fifth floor.
What?
He went out the window!
From the fifth fucking floor?
He's crazy.
Darcy!
What the fuck?
Shit! Fuck!
Victor.
Shit!
Where is he?
They wasted Goff.
- They wasted Charles, too.
- Over here! Come on!
Get in!
Come on!
Over here!
Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?
Turn the fuck around!
Turn the fuck around!
- What the fuck!
- Hi. I'm Beatrice.
You told me to get here.
I'm sorry I made him late.
What's going on?
See you later.
Did you see anyone running here, Vic?
No.
On, shit!
He took out Blotto,
Goff and even Charles.
We lost him.
Fuck!
You guys all right?
Tell him
what you told me about the cab.
This guy in the building...
he saw a man
take this photo from the stairwell.
Then they seen him getting into a cab.
A gypsy cab.
Paul was there, loo.
Found out the same thing.
It must've led him to something,
because he was wasted for it.
Find out where the cab went.
What did you do that for?
What I do what for?
Go looking with the pictures.
You've only been on this crew
a month longer than I have.
What if all this shit
happening lo Alphonse...
is because of something
that went down before you came?
This is an opportunity
of magnumus proportions to me.
How's that?
Of finding my next step
in the organization.
Yeah, well there might not be much
of an organization left.
I could run this place for him, Victor.
Better than Terry,
a whole lot better than fucking Kilroy.
I ain't joking around.
If I could just crack this shit for...
This is serious shit, Darcy.
Have enough money lo buy Lise
and Theo what they need.
Move up the ladder.
Fuck!
It's Lisa's car.
Mine's in the shop.
What?
Are you back with her?
Yeah,
she's acknowledging me.
It's a start right?
I promised her I'd make a plan.
Get ahead.
For her, and for Theo.
Just don't get too smart.
You saw what happened to Paul.
- I don't want anything to happen to you.
- I'm smarter than Paul.
I'm tired of being taken
for a fucking douche.
- I saw Alphonse respected me there-
-Oh, yeah-.
I saw it in his eyes.
Go ahead.
We're good.
HOYT
108
HOYT
108
Go on.
What the fuck.
I tied my shoe today.
I tied my shoe today.
I tied my shoe today.
Allo?
Hello.
This is Victor, is Beatrice...
Allo?
Hello. This is Victor.
ls Beatrice there?
Hello.
It's me.
I believe
you have something of mine?
Yeah.
Why did you follow me?
It's not the first time.
I wanted lo find out
more about you.
I think it's lucky I did-.
You want some water?
Sure.
So... Who are you?
My real name is Laszlo Kerik.
I was born in Hungary.
A few years ago my wife
and I came to America.
I was an engineer before.
We came here looking for work.
We took an apartment
in a building.
It was a building
they wanted lo control.
The men I saw?
They got most people
out of the building.
One night they came...
and they fired some shots.
To scare us.
So we would leave.
A bullet went through a wall...
and my daughter
was killed while she slept.
We were going to testify.
My wife and I.
The man responsible for it all...
Alphonse.
He gave his orders
to make sure he never went to trial.
And they were followed.
He was afraid to use his own guys, so...
they sent a crew
of Albanians after us.
They killed my wife.
And they thought they killed me too.
And they should have made sure of it.
Cigarette?
Yeah.
When I manage
to forget what happened to me.
When there are no mirrors,
and no people that reminds me.
And my mom makes me laugh.
These moments.
I have hope.
Maman says that I...
that it's these moments
that makes the pain bearable.
These moments...
I should try
and find them where I can and...
hang onto them.
But they're fleeting.
And then I remember and...
I'm filled with so much hale...
that I want to set
the whole world on fire.
I'm sorry
I made you tell about your family.
I don't want to be one
of those people that reminds you.
You're the one who
is going to help me forget-.
These men...
They don't seem easy to beat.
And you might
have used up all your luck.
So...
It's yellow.
Chartreuse.
Keep it.
I need you around.
Rabbits don't come in chartreuse.
Did you eat the cookies?
No.
Maman makes a good cookie.
I only ask you
to return the Tupperware.
She likes her Tupperware.
Have you made any progress?
I will.
I know.
Because I realize now if I call the police
and tell them what I saw...
it's not prison you're afraid of.
It's that you won't get lo finish
your revenge.
I'm going to steep
in my own bed.
And why are you going to sleep
in your own bed?
Because Daddy
takes care of the monsters.
All right, baby.
Tell me once more, all right?
Because Daddy keeps care
of the monsters.
That's not the biggest smile
you have.
That's not the biggest smile
you have.
And why are you going to sleep
in your own bed?
Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.
Why baby?
Tell me once more. Why?
Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.
I'm so happy that you're here.
Yeah.
I just needed some time,
Florence.
Now I'm going to cry.
I was worried
when you didn't contact my friend.
Nicholas.
The therapist.
Oh, yeah.
He really did wonders
helping me out.
He could help you.
I found someone else.
As long as
you're getting the help you need.
Yeah.
I'm in good hands.
You clever motherfucker.
I'm gonna open the windows.
It's fucking hot in here.
Hey, Kilroy,
you want something to eat?
Yeah, I could eat.
I'm in my office.
You guys want a game?
Come on.
Come on!
HEY-
anything going on?
No.
Any pick ups?
Make sure
you keep your cell on.
I don't know
what Al's got going.
Are you sure it's the AR 43?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm looking at it right here.
It was installed two days ago.
Then there is nothing wrong
with your remote.
There's a barrier
your signal won't get through.
The AR3 is an KR unit...
that is used in banks
and government buildings.
What is the application
for your trigger?
Warehouse.
That's interference.
You will have to be inside the LR ring,
or forget it.
Unless you start from scratch
and go to a new system.
No, I can't do that.
Not enough time.
Too much interference.
You would have to detonate inside.
You lost a wife
and a daughter.
But don't forget...
I lost a niece
and her little one.
I don't want
to lose you too.
Now you know everything.
No.
No, I don't.
How come an engineer
knows so much about guns?
Military service.
Back home.
So, what you said on the phone.
Is that your plan?
To get everybody
into this warehouse?
Yes.
Alphonse is always there.
I just need
to get the Albanians there, too.
There are many men.
But,
your bombs doesn't work.
They work.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another is you don't care
if you get out of there.
You'd rather die than fail.
Don't worry about it.
I'll be around long enough to do
what you asked me to do.
I don't want you to do that.
Bring me food.
My morn likes lo cook.
It would
just go to waste otherwise.
I'll wedge it in between the mustard
and plastic explosives.
You may not care
if you get out alive...
but in the meantime,
you should eat.
My rabbit's foot.
If you don't believe in it,
I'll take it back.
Bye.
Delivery Confirmation
Sign right here.
Ilir.
Hello'?
Hey, 'IVs Fonz.
Listen.
I found this lawyer.
He says he can close
financing for the uptown buildings.
And he don't know anything
about Lon pulling out.
Is this guy clean'?
Yeah.
He wants to see
the Commerce Building.
So I'm gonna meet him
there tonight at nine.
What if our problem shows up?
Fucking 'I don't know'
kind of shit, man.
No, you're the only one that knows.
I gotta go-
Yeah.
Yo, Vic.
You with anybody?
Yeah.
I'm busy.
Well, drop your dick.
I found the gypsy cab.
The guy at the cab company says
he remembers Paul.
Paul was there.
I'm like a detective,
a detective, man.
Like Columbo.
I'm scaring myself.
Vic.
1'“ be right down.
Right.
Hey, Vic.
Vic.
This girl you're seeing.
She your girlfriend?
No.
Nothing serious.
She's got...
Her face.
Yeah.
Car accident.
Does it affect her?
You have no idea.
Hey,
you never mentioned her before.
You embarrassed about me?
- Yeah, I'm embarrassed about you.
- You're embarrassed about your friends, huh?
So?
This is it right here.
The cab
dropped off Paul right here.
You're sure?
Yeah.
They keep a track,
drop offs, pick ups.
All right, detective?
Can we leave now?
A cemetery?
That's creepy.
The office is closed tomorrow.
But I could call them.
Maybe I'll come by
with a picture of Paul.
See if anybody knows anything.
All right.
Fuck.
Come on.
I gotta get out of here.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
I just got some business
to take care of.
Come on in.
So what did you tell Darcy?
Your text said
not to tell anyone I was coming.
I told him I was...
I had something to do.
Here's your food.
I set a trap, Victor.
I said whoever walks
through that door at nine o'clock...
was going to have a real bad night.
The person doing this to me...
he's hurt.
Someone who lost someone.
Like the people in the picture.
And he's in a great deal of pain
because of the...
And it's a pain that I've caused.
Then he kills Paul.
And found he was in both feel.
Victor,
I want him to know something.
I want him to know that
if there's anything left in his world...
that he still cares about.
I'm going to find it.
And I'm gonna burn it down.
He's probably wondering right now
what I'm thinking.
What my plan is.
And how much I know.
Wouldn't you be wondering
what I'm thinking?
I would.
You know,
you're the only one I can trust, Victor.
You know why?
No.
Because you saved my life
at Harry's.
It would be something though.
If you saved my life...
only to be the one
who kills me.
Have a seal.
I must stand, please.
They're outside.
The other day...
you told me
that if I helped you...
Yes!
Believe what I say,
my friend.
I don't know my boss...
He will not know.
You guarantee that?
That I won't be harmed?
I swear to God.
Please.
You're asking me these things...
so I know
you've been thinking about it.
About me in here.
All right.
Listen lo me.
You're in the city... all right?
You're in the basement
of my boss's warehouse.
His name is Alphonse.
Alphonse Hoyt.
I don't know what your brother
or his men did to him.
They're gonna kill you
whether he pays or not.
I got a camera.
You can record a message
for your brother.
I'll make sure he gels it.
We gotta go fast.
Thank you.
Tell him where you are.
It's important
to tell him where you are.
I swear to you.
Speak.
Thank you.
I promise you...
We killed you.
We killed you all!
We killed you all!
I swear on their graves,
you didn't.
I swear!
I swear on their graves,
you didn't!
No, no, no!
No!

Please!

Don't let me die...!
Please have mercy!
Please!
Don't let me die like this!
Please!
Yeah.
Yo, I tracked down the manager.
What manager?
From the bone yard.
I thought it was closed today.
He's gonna be here in 15.
Says he's needs to feed
some fish or some shit-.
I can meet him alone,
if you're busy.
No.
No, I'll be there.
All right.
Fuck!
Fuck!
I need to send this package.
But I gotta take care
of something I didn't count on.--...
so can you send it for me?
Yeah.
What is it?
You don't need to know what it is.
I need to know what it is.
What is it?
It's a video.
It's one of the Albanians,
saying something I need him to say...
to the person I need him to say it to.
All right?
Okay-
You need lo gel a tracking number.
With alerts lo my cell phone.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Wait.
Tell your mother
it was very good.
Yeah?
It's not too salty?
No.
It was perfect.
Hey, this shit's coming together-.
Paul was definitely here.
How'd you know he was here?
The manager.
He asked for this.
It's a list
of all the people buried here.
The guy said he was interested
in the Hungarian section.
The Hungarian section.
Did he say why?
No.
There's hundreds of them.
What happened to that girl?
That girl you told me
about across the way from you.
You ever meet her?
Yeah. I met her.
And?
You didn't die two years ago.
They found the cemetery.
They're getting close.
The one
who found you before got lucky.
And just because
he found the grave...
doesn't mean
that they will figure it out as well.
You can walk away still.
Not loo late.
I know why
you've been wailing so long.
Why you haven't killed him.
I think you're afraid
that when it's over...
it won't mend your heart.
It was going lo waste.
I just felt like putting it on.
- Okay, lets go.
- Hey, monster!
Hey!
What happened?
I fall.
And ruined a nice dress.
Let's see.
You okay?
At least
it wasn't on my good side.
I sent your package.
I have your tracking number.
Thank you.
Hello, Victor.
Hello.
Thank you
for returning my Tupperware.
Of course.
People usually don't.
Like it comes with the food.
Free Tupperware.
Did you like the food?
Yeah.
The food was... very good.
Beatrice didn't tell you?
She was nervous
you wouldn't like her cooking.
I always told her...
the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.
Well all the way.
She'll keep you well fed.
That's for sure.
You know, this thing..-
me falling and hitting my head?
Maybe it happened
because I lost my rabbit's foot.
The truth is my morn gave it to me
after the accident-.
She said it was going to bring me luck
with my procedures.
I picked the color.
Stupid chartreuse.
HEY-
Would you go out
with me tonight?
Somewhere.
Anywhere.
Yeah.
Okay-
Yeah.
Laszlo Kerik.
Laszlo Kerik?
Do you know the name?
No.
No, I don't know him.
I didn't think you would.
I've been searching every dead
Hungarian on this cemetery list.
This went down nine months
before we were on the crew.
There was a court case
involving Alphonse and a little girl...
who was killed
in one of his buildings.
The case never went to trial.
Get this, right?
The little girl's
mommy and daddy...
They died
like two months afterwards.
They're buried
right there next lo her.
Vic?
You there?
Vic?
Vic?
Yeah. I'm here.
I did it, man.
I fucking did it.
I found out exactly
what Paul must have found out.
I want to tell Alphonse.
I want you to he there when I tell him.
Can you get there?
No, I'm in the middle of something.
I'll talk to you later.
Oh, Victor.
I didn't know you were coming.
I would have thrown something on.
Maman,
you knew very well he was coming.
Well, I told you so.
Ready?
So...uh...
Where are we going?
You'll see.
A club?
Very cold.
A Park?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Good.
This is...
The bar.
In his house,
some credit card receipts.
He usually leaves the bar
at 8:30 every night.
He look a trip.
I want lo make sure he's back.
If he's here tonight,
he'll probably be here tomorrow night.
I'm prepared to do it then.
L-q-
I've found a moment... with you.
I want lo hang onto it.
It's not gonna end up that way.
I never said it would.
Not with words.
I wore that white dress for you.
Was that a mistake?
Yes.
Wail here.
I'll be back in a minute.
What did you do?
Here.
It's done.
It's done.
Nope.
Hold up.
Oh, it's this one.
So you're saying
it's someone who knew them?
He must have.
Cause this guy's dead, right?
Right?
What is it?
The little girl died June 17th.
Two years ago. Right?
Yeah.
June 17th is tomorrow.
Beatrice!
What are you doing?
Huh?
0h, my God!
Beatrice.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah,
I'm walking back to him now.
Okay-

Hey, you know who this is?
Right?
Yeah, I know who it is.
I've been getting these weird letters
for the past three months.

With the eyes crossed out?
We been getting them too.
Whoever is doing it took my brother.
You remember this...

Delivery Confirmation
he is still alive
Maybe more moments - Laszlo
Vic!
You didn't mail the package.
You didn't kill him-.
You didn't kill him
because you feel something for me.
You knew how I would feel.
You didn't mail
the package.
I tried.
And the guy walked away,
and I called him back.
I called him back,
because I feel something for you.
I could love you.
I don't want you to die.
So I thought if I could just mess up
one of your things, just one thing...
it would be enough
so it wouldn't work out the way you planned.
So I put my rabbit's foot
in that package.
And I took
the video card out.
They got
my rabbit's foot instead.
We can run away.
They'd find us.
We'd keep on running.
We'd travel by night.
I don't care how far we have to go.
Vic?
What.._? Shit.-.
Laszlo.
Fucking Laszlo.
I'm gonna wail for you here.
Where are you?
I'm outside your apartment.
Come back. Please.
Beatrice,
I want you to go to your apartment now.
Go there now...
and slay there and wait for me.
Okay.
Come back!
If you fucking scream,
it will go bad!
Okay?
Okay?
Laszlo fucking Kerik.
You made me a douche,
Laszlo Kerik.
I've seen your artwork.
I've seen your fucking pictures.
You put Paul in the freezer.
This has nothing to do with you.
I sent you
to my apartment to save you.
All right.
You weren't supposed to go inside.
Yeah, but I did go inside.
I was worried about you.
I don't want to fucking kill you.
Take this opportunity,
and you let her go.
You lied to me.
You fucking lied to me.
The godfather of my son.
Let her go. Let her go-.
You listen to me.
You get in your shitty car
that does start.
You start your shitty car.
And you drive
your shitty car to Alphonse's.
We'll be waiting.
Fuck.
