Hey, yo, that was tight, son.
Good luck, then.
All right?
Which one of those little fast girls...
gave you those?
None of'em.
They're for you.
Oh, Devon.
Sayin' I wouldn't be here...
if it wasn't for you.
Wouldn't have made
it without you.
You're gonna be cool, right?
I mean...
I feel kinda weird
leavin' you by yourself.
Boy, please.
Now that you gone
I'm gettin' ready to party.
[Chuckles]
Uh, well, look...
I gotta run real quick.
Uh, wait, now.
We got people comin' by the house.
It'll be real fast.

I promise. Real quick.
Next.

What the hell is this?
I'm Devon.
What?
I'm Devon.
I been comin' down here...
every day for the last 2 weeks...
thinkin' if I should give you
that ticket...
to my graduation.
Now I changed my mind.
Look, man...
I just want to let you know...
that I got my diploma.
I ain't never been arrested.
I don't have a whole bunch
of kids runnin' around.
Unlike yourself...
I'm doin' somethin'
with my music.
I got a full scholarship
to Atlanta A&T....
playin' the drums.
I want to say
I hope you're proud...
'cause I made it without you.

from this day forward!
I'm Buck Wild!

white T-shirts at all times.
It'll help us identify you...
as a crab who knows
absolutely nothing.
Maybe you will one day
have the honor and privilege...
to wear the school colors,
but for now...
you as blank as the white T-shirts
you'll be wearin'!
Understand?

Understand?!
Group: Yes, sir!
Get up to your dorms.
Get well acquainted
with the rule book.

"Come Marching In" Playing]
[Playing Stops]
Good morning.
Group, Sluggish:
Good morning.
Good morning to music.
Good morning and welcome...
to Atlanta A&T University
marching band training.
The next 2 weeks
will be your introduction...
and possibly induction...
into a great marching band legacy.
If you're here...
it's because you believe
in musicianship.
If you're here...
it's because you believe in...
Coltrane, Miles Davis,
Stevie Wonder...
and the elements known as
Earth, Wind, and Fire.
If you are here...
it is because
you have a fervent...
unequivocal belief...
in teamwork!
Boy: Come on. Hurry up.
And if you wish to remain here...
you better start believing
in being on time.
You...
who is your roommate?
Uh, Devon.
Uh, Miles.
[Muffled Laughter]
Sir.
Eyes front!
What's up, Dr. Lee?
It's all good, Mr. Miles.
Glad to have you here.
Thank you, sir.
Why was he late?
I guess he overslept.
Well, why didn't you wake him?
I'm not his mother, sir.
I asked Mr. Miles...
why his roommate was late!
He says, he "guesses" he overslept!
I asked,
''Why didn't you wake him?''
And he says
he is not his mother!
Section leaders,
what is our concept?
Section Leaders:
One band, one sound.
One band, one sound.
When one of us is late...
we are all late.
When one of us
looks or sounds bad...
we all look and sound bad!
So what's the concept?
Group:
One band, one sound.
Now I want 1 0 laps
from all those...
who "are not"
their roommate's mama.

Dr. Lee:
People. People, run...
don't walk.
## Lord, I want ##
## To be in that number ##
Dr. Lee:
Move it along, baby.

Trumpets are the voice
of the band.
We are the melody.
We are the clarity.
Tubas are the most important
section in this band, boy!
Tubas are the boom--
Saxophones are the truth,
the funk, and the hook.
See, once they hear us...
[Rhythmic Clapping]
We are the heart...
and the soul.
Without the percussion section...
the band doesn't move,
doesn't come alive.
[Heart Beating]
We are the pulse...
and without a pulse...
you're dead.
That's why we're the most important
section of this band.
[Whistle Blows]
Man: All right, band.
1 0 minute break!
Whoa.
Where the hell y'all goin'?!
He said take a break.
Did I say take a break?
- No.
- No?
No, big brother Iron Man, sir.
We do not rest with the band
in performance...
and we do not rest with the band
in practice.
Give me 30 push-ups.
You got a problem?
Nah, dog.
You want 30 push-ups,
you got 30 push-ups.
Iron Man: Make it 3 2.
[Laughing]
Hey...
look at this.
We got a girl on line.
A G.I.Jane in the house.
[Laughing]
Hey, baby,
you might wanna do...
some, uh, girl push-ups,
because, you know...
guys like a little something...
soft to hold on to.
[Laughing]
- Damn!
- Damn!
Iron Man:
Pick out a drum...
from this side only.
Sign 'em out over here.
Enjoy it now...
'cause this might be the last time
some of y'all see a drum.
What the hell you doin'?
Gettin' my drum.
Nah, nah, see...
these are for A&T drumline only...
P-1 s.
You are not a P-1 .
You are a crab.
Now take it off.
I'll take it off
when you calm down.
Group: Ooooh.
Everybody clear outta here.
Now!
Boy, don't you
ever disrespect me.
Dog, you gotta give respect to get it.
What, you threatened by me?
I don't know shit about you, crab.
Nah?
So, you don't know
how your man, Dr. Lee...
came all the way to the N.Y.
to sit in my living room...
and tell my mom
how much this band needs me?
I don't give a damn
if he stayed in your mama's bed.
I own the drumline.
You wanna get down,
you come through me.
Now take off my drum.
Your raggedy-ass shit...
is right over there.
Buck Wild: Let's go!
Iron Man:
If you can't hang...
put your drum in storage...
and go home!
Now, move your ass, lift your feet,
and you'll make it to the top!
Buck Wild:
Y'all can't wear my colors...
runnin' like that!
Let's go, Uncle Ben.
I bet your country ass
would run faster if I had...
one of your grandmama's
hot butter biscuits.
I guess it ain't white boy day, is it?
Come on. Let's roll.
Come on, tubas.
Let's go.
Come on, boy.
That's why your raggedy ass
gets a raggedy drum.
Boy, you gonna graduate
in that white T-shirt. Damn!

[Chanting Cadences]
What's your name, crab?
Jayson Flore, sir.
A.K.A. Affirmative Action.
Brilliantly named...
by big brother Iron Man yesterday.
What's wrong?
They don't have enough black people
in Georgia Tech?
I don't find their marching style
or musical selections...
interesting enough, sir!
And no...
they don't have enough black people.
[All Laughing]
Now you done messed up the cadence.
[Groaning]
Iron Man:
Take it from the top.
Ah, shit.
They don't tell you about all this
when they recruit you.
[Jayson Groans]
I wouldn't know
Mr. First-Round Draft Pick.
You wanna talk about hard?
Try switching from
corps-style marching...
to traditional style.
Now, that's hard.
[Chuckling]
I bet you that is hard for you, B.
[Ernest Laughing]
Yeah, right. Don't even try that...
"White Men Can'tJump" bullshit.
I got skills, man.
I'm just sayin',
in my high school...
marching band
was all about military precision.

I coulda been
a P-1 at Georgia Tech...
or U.G.A. in a minute.
OK.
So, what you here for, then?
I love black people.
[Laughing]
All right. All right.
No, on the real, man...
I love this band.
I grew up right down the street.
When I was little...
I could hear 'em practicing
down the block from my house.
I'd be outside playin'--
[Mocking Violin Music]
I'm serious, y'all.
Come on.
Shoot.
A&T's the reason...
I picked up a drum
in the first place.
I feel you on that one, dog.

''The beginning is always today.''
One of my favorite quotes.
President Wagner,
what a pleasant surprise.
So, what exciting new beginnings...
can we look forward to this year?
Well, for the most part,
I'll continue with...
the overall direction
of the program.
That direction is a losing one.
I don't think we can measure
the success of our program...
by the number of people...
shaking their butts
in the stands...
and no, we didn't win
the B.E.T. Classic...
but our first obligation
is to educate...
and then entertain.
Please,
not the edu-tainment speech,James.
Save it for your students.
It's a good one.
The kids in my program are learning.
There won't be a program...
if the alumni continue
to lose interest.
We win, they write checks.
Dr. Henderson was smart enough
to know that.
He played popular music.
That was James Brown
and Marvin Gaye...
not "The Thong Song."
Now, I will play popular music...
but not at the expense
of musicianship.
When you hired me...
you wanted me
to strive for excellence...
and that is exactly
what I am doing.
I also said we needed to win.
Buck Wild: 1 , 2.
1 , 2.

- Dr. Lee: Freeze!
I want your knees hitting your chest.
Then drive your feet into the ground.
I'll say it again!
Knees into chest!
Then feet hit the ground!
Buck Wild!
When I say, ''chest,''
you say, ''out.''
- Chest!
- Group: Out!
- Chest!
- Out!

What's wrong with your chest?

What's wrong with his chest?

[Hip-Hop Song Playing]
I'm sorry, but, um...
rehearsals are closed.
I didn't know you was a dancer.
Do I know you?
What, you don't know?
Dr. Lee sent me over...
you know, to check on things.
To check on things?
Yeah. See, they got this
hot new snare drummer...
real good-lookin' brother
with cornrows.
Yeah, he about to bring it...
like you ain't never heard.
See, I can help you out...
with a couple of them dance moves.
1 , 2. 3.
Pop it. Take it.
Drop it. Yeah.
Beat it, Devon.
Thought you ain't remember me.
Iron Man:
A break is 5 minutes...
not 1 5.
Hey, Devon,
you know if you keep messin' up...
Ernest actually might get a chest.
[Laughter]
[Straining]
Oh.
And Diedre might get strong enough...
to pick up a hot comb.
[Laughter]
[Rhythmic Drumming]
Iron Man:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up.
What are y'all lookin' at?
Drums ain't goin' nowhere...
so what you clowns
lookin' down for?
Always remember this.
Playin' the drums...
it's like makin' love.
You can't be lookin' down there...
seein' what's going' on,
trying to get the flow right.
Eyes on me.
Don't look down.
Yeah.
Now, when you
makin' love right...
when you handlin'
your business...
you feel it!
[Sticks Clatter]
Ugh.
Maybe you don't.
Eyes on me.
Mm-hmm!
Yeah...
you know how it is...
when you hittin' that spot, right?
Don't ya, girl?
Never look down.
[Sticks Clatter]
Dr. Lee:
That was impressive.
Thank you, sir.
What I like most...
was instead of
making Sean look bad...
you made yourself
look like a jackass.
Let's take this from the top...
and this time, follow me.
Don't look down, remember?
You have to learn to follow...
before you can lead, Mr. Miles.
Sean: Congratulations.
You're not crabs anymore.
Now you're crab drummers.
And tomorrow...
it's tree-shaking eliminations...
which will determine
who will become A&T drummers.
So tonight, celebrate...
'cause you made it through training.
[Start Cheers]
Yo, whoa, whoa.
After you prove
a thorough knowledge of the rule book.
What is mandatory
of all A&T musicians?
All A&T musicians must read music.
When can a P-2 or P-3...
challenge for a spot on the field?
At the practice
before the performance, sir.
What is...
last rule of the rule book?
Uh.
Head, uh...
Stay ahead of the game.
[Muted Groans]
One band, one sound means...
you all are responsible
for each other.
That means
all of you are responsible...
for showing "Boyz In The Hood" here
what the last rule is.
What y'all laughing at?
Down, boy!
Sit down!
What's up? I'm going to get
a lap dance or something?
From Diedre.
Something like that.
Sean: Why don't you read
the last page, brother?
All right, all right.
''If you do not read this rule book...''
All: ''Your head will be shaved.''
I told you to read the book.
I told you, dog.
Devon, Devon,
would you like me to help you...
take your cornrows out?
Would you like me to help you
take yours out?
Ernest:
Show you some love, dog.
Hey, Dev, let me tell you.
You can look like me...
but you ain't never
going to play like me.
[Crowd Jeers]
Watch my nerves.
You ain't touching my head.
You don't follow the rules...
you don't audition.
Whatever, man.
Is that what you want me
to tell Dr. Lee?
I don't care what you tell him.
Dr. Lee ain't my daddy.
This is bullshit.
Man, how much fish
is Charles going to put in there?
He going to short out
the whole building. Damn!
You know, uh, big brother Sean
is going to be really happy...
when he finds out
you quit the band...
'cause of some stupid haircut.
'cause of some stupid haircut.
[Muffled Dance Music Playing]
Well, all right.
I'm about to go get up
on some honeys.
Holler!
[Dance Music Playing]
This is the best.
[All Cheer]
I got my homeboy
right down the middle.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Hold up.
Who in here can do
an uptown fade?
[All Yelling]
I got this.
I got this one.
Dr. Lee:
All right, crabs, check up!
Tree-shaking is going
to rank you P-1 through P-4.
But only P-1 s are guaranteed
a spot on the field.
Now, if you're a P-2 or a P-3,
you can still get a spot...
in sections that are available,
so do your best.
I'll see you all on the other side.
[Car Horns Blow]
Man: Who is that?
That's the upperclassmen.
They flash their lights
to say what ranking...
they think we should get.
Hey, Charles,
what's up with your socks?
Man, don't worry
about my socks, man.
It's a tuba thing, shorty.
Better be.
Mr. Miles,
please play the required piece.
It's on the stand.
You notice this crab
hasn't looked down...
at his sheet music once?
- So?
- So?
Who memorizes an audition piece?
It's complicated.
It's supposed to be read.
They expect you
to stumble through it.
Like you did?
Dr. Lee:
Mr. Miles, I guess you didn't like...
the required piece as written.
No, I just thought I'd add...
a little something-something
on the end.
Sean: He can play.
We all know that.
But his attitude is messed up.
Now, I've put 3 years
into building this line.
And the chemistry's great
and I don't want to jeopardize that.
[Car Horns Blow]
Your line seems to think otherwise.
Yeah! P-2 bass! Ow!
I did it, ma.
Yeah, P-1 and everything.
The only freshman to do that.
I was just calling to let you know
everything is everything.
Come on,
you know what that means.
Yeah, it's all good.
Excuse me.
Hi. I'm looking for...
this really good-looking brother
with cornrows.
- And I heard--
- Student: Shh!
I heard he made the drumline.
Oh, so now you got jokes.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
You know I can't wait
to see you move to my beats.
Do women actually respond
to the way you come at them?
Well, actually,
they usually come at me.
## This is a man's world ##
W-What? Wait.
Where you going?
My bad. Hold on.
Why don't you school me
on how to come at a sister.
OK.
How about showing some interest
in something...
other than the way she looks?
All right.
Let me see what you got here.
Damn, girl!
What you, part of Oprah's book club?
I'm a philosophy major.
Dang. Philosophy?
That's deep.
Yeah.
Like, Ms. S.A.T. Girl, huh?
Your parents probably
used to put...
all your report cards
on the refrigerator.
Mom be talking about,
''Aw, look...
''my baby done got another "A."
Yes, she did.''
Something like that.
What about you?
What major makes
your parents proud?
Hey, to tell you the truth...
I never even thought
I'd be in college...
till Dr. Lee recruited me.
It's that simple for you, huh?
Yeah.
I should--
You know what?
Let me get these for you.
That's so cute.
Yeah, I thought you'd like that.
I did. I liked it.
But I can manage.
I have a car.
Word?
Snares, listen up.
This last drum part...
before my solo's very complicated.
Pay attention.
Now, I'm gonna
go through it slow.
Pay attention.
Sean: Now the first game's
a week away...
so you're gonna have to step up
to the learning curve quick.
So take out your sheet music--
[Drumbeat]
Yeah, that'll work.
[Line Laughs]
All right.
Choreography formation plots...
will be worked out
on Wednesday...
and we will have our first
run-through on Saturday.
This is one of the new songs
for our first game.
It's by E.W.F.:

Man: Old school.
Come on, now.
What y'all complaining about, huh?
Oh, oh, oh, I see.
Y'all think y'all a band?
All: Yes.
See, Earth, Wind, and Fire was a band.
Woman:
Back in your time.
Dr. Lee: Hold it. Hold it.
So it's like that?
So, what y'all want to play?
A little Angie Stone?
All: Yeah!
What? LL CoolJ?
All: Yeah!
Snoop Doggy Dogg?
Ha ha! Ha ha!
All these artists sample
from this group, OK?
That's what we going to play.
Let's focus.

## On and on, I'm on this drum ##
## And I'm tight like spandex ##
## What I do with my hands next ##
## Like, check,
making all the crabs cream ##
## This young Harlem child
put it down like bling ##
[Crowd Cheering]
[Crowd Cheering]
Dang, the crowd is louder...
than when the football team
was on the field.
'Cause down here,
it's about the marching bands, dog.
Halftime is game time.
Sean: Percussion!
Last words of advice...
for our young 'uns on-line.
You drop your sticks,
don't reach down and pick 'em up.
Just keep moving your hands.
I don't never drop my sticks.
Kid, you about to step...
in front of thousands of people.
The crowd. The lights. It's scary...
even for a hothead like you.
Yeah, I bet you it's even scarier
for somebody with a wack solo.
What?
I ain't mumblin'.
You want my solo?
Take it.
What?
Yo, son, you don't even
want to tell me that.
It's all you, son.
Come with it.
Dude, what are you doing?
He'll freeze up
like any other freshman.
His ass needs to be broken.
All right, Panthers...
let's start this season off right.
One band, one sound.
Band: A&T!
Whoo! Ha ha!
P.A.: This is the moment
you've all been waiting for.
Get on your feet...
and be prepared
for the baddest band...
in the land...
the A&T Marching Panthers...
putting it down dirty-South style!
The A.T.L. is in the house!
P.A.: Hold up!
Wait a minute!
Let us put some drums in it!
Y'all ain't ready for
what we about to put down.
The baddest drumline
in the land!
What we are, you can't smoke,
you can't sniff it...
'cause we were born with it!
Get ready to see
how we put it down...
A.T.L. style!
Drumline, get your thing on!
Unbuckle your seat belts!
That's it!
The baddest band
in the land--A&T!
You think you know...
but you have no idea.
Hey, yo, man,
that was tight, bro.
What was that?
What did we rehearse?
Why do we rehearse?
You were out there
showboating for 5 minutes.
If I wasn't able to signal...
the drum major
to wrap you up...
you'd still be out there
beating your damn drum!
Dr. Lee, sir, um,
there's an explanation.
See, Devon here thought--
Do I look like I need you...
to explain anything
to me right now?
No, sir.
I don't know what
the beef is between you...
but you'd better grill it up
and eat it...
because it is my ass
that is on the line.
Now, that is a new beginning.
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.
Great job, son.
Really something.
You were something special.
Thank you, sir.
Great job, all of you.
Now, let's see Morris Brown top that!
[Band Cheering]
Some alumni want to speak with you.
Just need one moment, sir.
There they are.
Don't keep them waiting.
New beginning!
Wagner: New beginning!
Sean...
I want you to polish
the drums tonight...
and I'd better be able
to see myself in the silver.
Yes, sir.
I left the polish
on the bottom shelf, B.
[Ernest Chewing And Sighing]
[Mumbles]
This is good.
Devon, man, I need
to tell you, brother...
you killed them out there.
You did your thing today.
You're gonna be all right, dog.
For real. You nice.
So, what's up with me
and y'all tonight?
What we gonna do?
Sorry, dog.
I already got plans.
Oh, OK, OK, all right.
Uh, you in a hurry, brother?
No. Well, yeah.
Yeah, I gotta go to this little...
meeting, a little party
or whatever, you know.
Dog tired, though.
Diedre:
Would you like to go out with me?
I can keep you awake.
Word?
Yeah.
No! No, no, I gotta...
I gotta handle my business.
I gotta do my thing on my own.
One love...and all that.
Be easy!
He spit right in my French fries.
Let me get the large fries
and diet coke, please.
I got this.
Keep the change.
Whoa. Oh, big spender.
Let me see. $2.27.
Thank you.
Dang, ease up.
We just started dating.
All-you-can-eat joints
come a little later.
So, there is a date?
Yeah, I'm trying to set up...
a little casual dating situation.
Really?
Hmm.
But southern sisters,
we don't casually date.
We have boyfriends.
Eh--heh heh!
Ooh. You killing me
with the ''B'' word.
Um...OK.
Let's just say for pretend...
OK.
What would a boyfriend do
in this situation?
He'd take me
to the Sigma party tonight.
[Hip-Hop Music Playing]
Men: ## Get going with it,
get down with it ##
## Whoo-ha!J.K. Style... ##
Laila, honey, let's do the step.
OK.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
[Music Stops]
You ladies feel a step coming on?
Dancers: Oh, yeah!
Man: Get it, girl.
Woman: Ooh, work it!
## Break it down now ##
## Sigma ##
## Ow! ##
## Phi ##
## All right ##

"[Butterflyz" By Alicia Keys Playing]
## Mm-hmm-mmm ##
## Lately when I look into your eyes ##
## Baby, I fly ##
## You're the only one
I need in my life ##
## Baby, I just don't know
how to describe ##
## How lovely
you make me feel inside ##
## You give me butterflyz ##
Mr. Taylor...
you finish
those halftime cadences yet?
Just finished them.
Good. Let's hear it.
Actually, Dr. Lee,
why don't we let Devon run it?
Oh, nah.
You the big dog.
Do your thing.
No, I really think it'd help
if somebody else played it.
I wouldn't do it no justice.
What are you two--
Beavis and Black-head?
It doesn't have to be perfect,
Devon.
I just want to hear it.
Come on. You knocked
that cadence out I did...
in, like, a minute.
You got it.
Go on, rip it, dog.
Go on, dog.
Dr. Lee: Let's go, Devon.
Band Member:
What's wrong, D?
Dr. Lee:
Mr. Miles, is there a problem?
Don't feel like playing
that wack-ass cadence.
Yo, that was a bitch move, Sean.
It's obvious,
if anybody bothered to pay attention.
Personally, I don't give a damn...
if the boy can't read a book.
He's strong, and you know it.
Have some respect
for your section, Robert.
Snares have a standard.
It's my job to protect the line
and that's what I did.
You don't like it, follow his ass out.
You lied on your application...
you lied at your audition...
when you played
the required piece...
and you lied to me.
I didn't think
it was that big a deal.
Play that.
That's the music
for next week's game...
and you can't read it.
And as far as I'm concerned...
that's a very big deal.
I'm enrolling you...
in the applied percussion course.
Man, that gives me 5 classes.
Damn right it gives you 5 classes...
and it ought to be 1 0...
especially if you plan
on getting back on the line...
anytime soon.
What you mean
getting back on the line?
I mean now you're a P-4.
If you cannot read music...
you cannot be on my field.
Man, you can't take me off the line.
I'm the best drummer you got.
Ain't can't no class teach me
how to do me.
Excuse me?
Doing me is what got me down here
in the first place.
No, lying...
is what got you down here.
And if you don't have
the honor and discipline...
to learn your craft...
then quite frankly, Devon,
you don't deserve to be here.
Laila:
I don't get you sometimes.
If music is what you love...
why wouldn't you go to class?
You love dance, right?
Why you ain't studying that?
My parents are paying
for my education.
And to them...
dancing's not a real major.
Well, is it real to you?
Because when I see you
doing your thing out on the field,
you look happy.
That seems real to me.
It's not always
about doing what you love...
all the time, Devon.
See, I don't even get that, like,
so why you even come to A&T?
I always knew I'd be here.
Both my parents went to A&T.
My mom's a Sigma Phi Alpha
my dad's the all-American.
Just--ohh.
You'll meet them at homecoming.
What?
Brother's meeting the parents.
Please take that class.

we should be playing.
[Loud Cheering]
Announcer:
And it's halftime!
Prepare to experience 7 minutes...
of mind-blowing moves...
420 seconds of sensational sound.
Here they come...
the Morris Brown College
Marching Wolverine Band.
Drum major...
you may now take the field.
Hey, A&T, get your pencil
and paper out, baby!
"This" is how it's done.
Dr. Lee...
do you want to explain
why Devon is not on the field?
Not really.
No, let me rephrase.
I want my boy on the field now.
There are some issues
preventing that.
No, the only issue...
is for you to give me
the same show...
like you did the last game...
or there won't be
a program next year.
## It's on us ##
[Drums Playing]
I can't believe
we ain't stepping to them fools.
That's a straight up challenge.
A&T going out like some punks.
Is this how they make you
earn your scholarship?
Mr. Wayne,
Morris Brown College.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Devon.
Oh, I know who you are.
I'm a big fan.
You got a way with the crowds.
Thank you, sir.
The honorable Dr. Lee.
Whoo! I was just admiring
Devon's packing technique.
You know,
5 years as my assistant...
he still hasn't learned
to put his best players...
on the field.
Get on the bus.
You want to play some real music...
give me a call.
Heh heh! Oh, so...
now you have music
in your program.
You know, uh, if you're looking...
for a job this summer...
you can give me a call, too.
I got enough shit in my life.
I'll just use this
as toilet paper instead.
Whoo! Still got that baton
stuck up your ass, huh?
See y'all at the Classic.
[Band Practicing Scales]
Slight change, everyone.
Before we get started
with rehearsal...
Devon and Sean's
solo performance...
from the Wilmington game
will get added...
to the music for homecoming.
Choreography and formation plots
get worked out on Tuesday.
We give it a short test run
on Thursday and Friday.
Mr. Miles...strap up.
What the--
Let's get to work.
This is bullshit.
[Crowd Cheering]
A&T Announcer:
And there they are...
the homecoming king and queen...
and the A&T court.
But y'all know
it's all about the band...
at homecoming 2002.
On your feet for the greatest school...
and the baddest band in the land--
Atlanta A&T!
A&T Announcer:
Now that's why they call it homecoming.
You better recognize the realness.
Now give some love
to Dr.James Lee.
President Wagner: Yes.
[Laughs]
Meet Dr. Lee.
A&T Announcer:
They came all the way...
from Macon University...
for the annual drum battle.
There will be no discussion.
- We rule the cut.
- Hey!
So send out your best.
And remember, keep it clean.
One second.
They came here just to see you.
Hey!
Ha ha!
All: Hey!
Crowd: Boo!
A&T Announcer: That's it?
So it's amateur night, huh?
Watch this.
[Crowd Cheering]
Audience: Oh!
You see them twirl around?
Crowd: Ooh!
A&T Announcer: Oh, yeah.
The powder was real cute.
Audience: Oh!
Come on!
Good job, Roy.
You didn't tell me
you had all of this planned.
[Screams]
Break it up!
Break it up!
Hey, yo, big Rob,
you was throwin' crazy blows.
Hey, yo, big Rob,
you was throwin' crazy blows.
You had my back.
Good lookin' out.
Ain't nobody backin' up
your dumb ass.
I was throwin' for A&T.

Good game, huh, girl?
Second Dancer:
Yes, everything came out so beautiful.
I think we have
about 3 more games before...

Dad: OK, let's go.
[Students Chattering]
[Student Clears Throat]
- Shh.
- Shh.
[Conversations Stop]
Why didn't nobody tell me
we was havin' a meetin'?
We don't have to tell you anything.
Devon: What's goin' on?
A'ight.
That's how it's gonna be?
[Door Opens]
Yo, Dr. Lee, man, you gotta
talk to the line. They tripping.
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I got a little carried away.
There wasn't nobody steppin' up...
and I'm sayin'
you put me on the line...
'cause you know
I can make things happen.
I put you on the line
because I made a mistake...
and now I have
to do what I believe.
You are no longer a member
of this band.
Devon, there are things...
that you just
do not understand.
Devon?
Yeah. I figured you'd
just be gettin' off work.
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I just got up.
Uh-huh.
Mom, I'm fine. It's...
it's just midterms. Yeah.
Uh--uh, actually...
I should probably have
my head in a book right now.
Yeah, I was just calling
to say hey.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
I love you, too.
It ain't gonna be the same
without you, man.
It's all about the tubas now, dog.
What you mean? It's always
been about the tubas, shorty.
- Pfft.
- Ha ha. Pfft nothin'.
Hey, man, you know
how Dr. Lee is about time.
I know, man.
Yeah. You're on time...
if you're 5 minutes early.
You're late if you're on time.
[Laughs]
Hey, we gonna miss you, man.
Why you actin' like
the man's gonna leave school?
Look, fried okra night
in my room.
Be there, a'ight?
You a fool.
All right, then.
Take this.
All right.
Y'all stay up.
All right.
See you in class.
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!
What--What--
What in the hell was that?
Huh? Snares,
y'all need to pick it up.
Mr. Wade?
What--What is it? What?
Ok, break them up
into groups...
and do somethin', you know?
Yeah!
It's about time you got down here.
What took you so long?
Look, sorry to interrupt
your practice, sir.
[Laughs]
Man, you put on a show
up there...
at the homecoming
last week, ha ha.
But I bet Dr. Lee grounded you,
didn't he?
Actually,
he kicked me off the band.
I'm sorry to hear that, son.
But see, that's what happens...
when a talented brother like yourself
don't have a real place to shine.
Uh, you know, Mr. Wade...
I was wonderin' if maybe
you had a space for me...
on your band next year.
That's a definite possibility.
But I want you to think
very carefully about that--
Then you come back and see me.
In the meantime,
I'll talk to the coaches...
about the scholarship situation.
All right.
Thanks.
All right.
Look, I might as well
tell you this up front.
What's that?
I can't really read music.
Ha ha!
Don't worry about that.
A lot of folks can't read the sign
that says ''toilet.''
Don't mean they don't know
how to use one.
You want one? OK.
Just once,
could a brother get a slice of pizza?
Hi.
Devon.
Oh, snap,
now you can see me?
Look, I panicked.
My parents were
talking all that crap...
about ''that hoodlum on the field
that started the fight,''
and I just...
Devon, I'm--I'm sorry.
It ain't about your parents.
You left me hanging.
You know how that feels?
No?
Let me show you.
Sean: Dr. Lee?
Dr. Lee.
I just wanted to catch you
before rehearsal.
I was thinkin'
that instead of promoting...
a P-2 to replace Devon...
we might just keep
the snare line at 9.
And how long have you
been thinking that?
Just this mornin'.
Are you sure?
I thought maybe it was the day
you showed us all he couldn't read...
or maybe it was the night
he took your solo.
I don't know.
But since you heard him play...
you decided that the line
or perhaps maybe just you...
would be better off
without him.
Remember
when I first made you section leader?
You were sweatin' bullets,
wondering how you could lead...
this loud, passionate group
of your peers...
and I said you would be fine.
Remember why?
You said I loved
the sound of the line...
more than the sound
of my own drum.
Yes, and you've lost sight of that...
and that's OK because we all
lose sight of things sometimes.
But if you don't get it together,
Mr. Taylor...
you're gonna have a difficult time...
leading the senate
whether Devon is on it or not.
Mr. Wade:
Now I put in a word with Mr. Hill...
to get you some financial aid
next year...
hook you up with a part-time job
this summer...
put some money in your pocket.
You know you need some money, hmm?
Hmm?
Yeah. Yeah,
everybody needs some money...
and the B.E.T. Southern Classic
comin' up.
Where you gonna sit,
on the ground?
Sit up in the skybox with us.
You can see the honeys
way good up there.
Oh, yeah!
Most def.
So now, what can you tell me?
What you mean, what can I tell you?
What you mean?
What do I mean?
Oh, I know Dr. Lee is workin' on
somethin' big for the Classic.
The man's too damn stubborn...
to sit down and take...
his butt-whippin' like a man.
You know that.
[Chuckles]
I don't know.
There you go again.
You don't know.
[Laughs]
At least a play list.
No, I don't have no idea.
Lookie here, son...
I'm talkin' about throwin' a lot
of financial aid your way next year.
You need to give me somethin'.
Meet me halfway on this thing.
You don't wanna pass up
a deal like this.
[Laughs]
Look, man, I don't know
what Dr. Lee got planned.
Whatever it is,
I hope he wipes y'all up with it.
Fake-ass alligator shoes.
Hey, yo, D.
You got another package, man.
Cool.
Ernest: Hey, if it's, uh...
some more of your mother's cookin',
I want some.
'Cause those biscuits
she sent last time...
was off the chain.
'Night.

Yeah.
[Jazz Playing]
Hey, what's up, Dr. Lee?
Mr. Miles.
Um, I was wondering--
Well, we were wondering...
if you needed any entrance cadences
for the Classic?
Not that I'm tryin' to get back
on line or anything.
I just wanted you
to check 'em out.
No, no, no.
Let me see.
All right.
Now the concept is all Devon's.
Yeah, but my man Sean here
had the structure on lock.
But the snare part,
all the stickin'...
it's the kid.
What, you two a couple now?
It got a old school feel to it.
You know,
sometimes you gotta take it back.
That's not a bad idea.
Not a bad idea at all.
We're gonna try something...
a little different this year...
a little of my old school...
with a little of your new...
honoring the past
and the present at the same time.
And that's what
our new direction is all about--
Bridging the gap.
Our new piece
for the B.E.T. Big Southern Classic...
was arranged by 2 of your very own...

but it's not half as complicated...
as the formations are going to be.
We won't have any time
to waste here, people...

let's get crunk.
## To show you that I love you ##
## Won't you please let me ##
## Back in your heart? ##

I was blind to let you go ##
## Let you go, baby ##

## I want you back ##
## Yes, I do now ##

This is bullshit.
I should just go talk to Dr. Lee.

I would have came after you, too.
