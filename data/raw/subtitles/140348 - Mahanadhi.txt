From the period of great grandfathers
it was a three crop yield,
Nourished by the kaveri
water that comes along with stones.
Along with the mire
does not the seeds sprout?
Won't the breeze
come to chat with the sprout?
A garden of red plantain,
red sugar cane and jasmine.
Everything is here
and there is no withering at all.
Heaven is terrestrial not celestial.
Joy is in the eyes not in dreams.

Do you know that?
Dad, is my English wrong?
No, what she talks is English

Do you remember our school days?
I was in English medium

Now-a-days it is only tablets who is

When this boy was born, his wife...
Gate is open.
Evening, come to house
We have a lot more to talk.
Good morning, did the train disturb you?

This is 'Kanagathara sthothram'
Gold shower

The advocate for whom I was working

When I was going to court
In train someone stole the box.
The advocate didn't believe me
He lodged a complaint with the police.
Police arrested me.
My daughter's marriage with
my sister's son was fixed at that time.
That guy refused to marry my daughter

So my daughter's marriage was stopped
You know that too.
Is it not?
Why do you chuckle?
Are you an atheist?
Tell me some reply
Yes or no.
Yes and no
I am, whichever is convenient to you.

Why I came here because...

- How do I know?
Sir, what is it?
Nothing, you may go.

You may go.
Why do you say, it is nothing?
Do you have means to
pay for a scratch in my car.
Do you know to whom you are talking?
Sir has apologised
What a great thing it is! But still..
This will not do
Where is the police station?
Will you go to the police station?
- Ask for apology -Keep quiet,

- We will stay here only.
- Not required, go.
No, no, thank you
for not precipitating it.
Are you the MLA of this place?
No, no, I am an ordinary businessman.

This place resembles the one in song
'Require a land equivalent to a rood'

You have a betel nut powder factory
How is that, you don't chew?
I prepared it for you
Shall I throw it away?
No, no give it to me.
How many days in a week do you
sit like this and enjoy small pleasures?
- On Sundays and on festival days.
- You are doing a mistake there.
You must allot time for this daily
if you must have
the right man for everything.
Then you can do
even 50 business at a time.
Even for one business you require money.
There is an answer for that-OPM
- ls not opium a narcotic stuff?
- O P M, Other people's money.
Doing business in other people's money
is the latest in this century
He is scared.
She is my wife.
That is a waist band
Banyan leaf, it is Kaveri's.

Sorry, she is blabbering in her sleep

How many children

She is always like that
she is first in her class.
Because she is your daughter
She is first in class.
Had she been Nehru's daughter
She will be first in India, Indira Gandhi.
This girl should not be in this village.
They have to leave early morning
Go to bed.
- Seems she doesn't like city.
- Nothing like that.
- No, thanks -That's right,
if you don't like, shouldn't do it.
Bad guys can be there
in villages and cities too.
He will be omnipresent
We have to be careful.
Don't sit on your money
Come to the city and do some business.
Admit your children in
Church Park convent.
Jayalalitha madam studied in that school
I am also thinking on those lines.
In any case OPM is there
Not other people's money.
Manju, did you hear this?
OPM-Own Personal Money.
- You said about some chit fund.
- Eh?
You talked about starting
a new chit fund business.
What would be the investments
required to start a new chit fund?
- Tell the proprietor's name.
- Krishnaswami, he is the person.

Summer is approaching
Kids will ask for ice water.
There is no water problem
Over head tank is in upstairs.
Daily it will be filled up
Manju, show the kitchen to madam
it is OK
What?
- Where is the terrace?
- It is upstairs, go and see.
- Well? -Why do you
require that? There is a tank above.
- Have you fitted the AC in bedroom?
- Connections are to be given.
- Why do you do like this? Go man.
- Uncle, where is the AC? -inside.
- Dad, come here.
- Wait I am coming, you go and see.
Krishna, ask your mother in law
to sign for the bank guarantee
if I ask her,
she suspects me as if I am a cheat.
- Not like that
she is little apprehensive -Why?
She didn't even agree to sell the house.
She is hesitating to
pledge the factory also.
Do not hesitate
You should convince her.
When we start our chit fund
By a draw, we are giving 2 Maruti cars.
We require money for that
if you invest money, you will get returns.
Sir, the omen is really good.
Keep quiet, why do you also join them?
Since this is a lone house with no noise
He is barking for any little sound.
The ladies finger is very ripe
In our place we can check by breaking it.
Here they pick up quarrel if we do so
You cannot expect respect here.
But education and
amenities are available only here.
When our children
become doctors and engineers.
All our troubles will be forgotten.
Before that, ask Dhanush
to admit these children in school.
He is all the time
talking about the school..
. . Where Jayalalitha studied
But doesn't do anything.
We will admit them, you will
see them becoming doctor and engineer.
You coward.
What happened grandma?
Grandma.
Grandma.
Grandma, what happened?
- What is that noise?
- Were you frightened? -I was not.
Don't jump and fall over the chopper.

- Little ghost is coming.
- Dad, why do you put out the light?
- Hey nut, are you not a ghost? -Yes.
- Ghosts come only in darkness.
- Yes -Then come.
Dad.
What is this dad?
You have switched off all lights.
Little ghosts, shall we go
to the underground tunnel?
Dad, how did the steps come there?
- Hey it is me, dad -Why this shouting,
with all lights switched off?
- Nothing, I am playing with them.
- Is this a age to play?
Dad, I have no fears for tigers
I fear only ghosts.
Yes dad, we don't want this
Tell us some stories.
- Sing a song.
- Song?
At the beginning of the recital.
During the days of our ancestors
I am afraid dad.
In the days of grand parents
it was said ghosts reside in Banyan trees.
Sitting on temple ponds
and atop temple towers.
Don't believe it.

Why all this for me?
He is everything here, give it to him.
Gopal, give him a drink
Sit, I will join you.

Had she known about this
She would have killed me.

these people...

Will you not allow him

No, we have got to do our work
So many cheques!
Don't heave a sigh
I forgot, you just sign
this power of attorney.
You can sit peacefully.
Should not this be
discussed with the advocate?
You trust me,
this is only an evidence for that
if you don't want to sign this, it is OK.
- Sign the cheques.
- No, not that.
Greatly relieved now
I can talk peacefully with you now.
Shall I tell you something frankly?
When I saw your house
I felt I should live in such a house.
The door is closed
I think I am very blunt and lewd
I think you don't like me
talking like this, am I right?
I want to be one among
your family members.
Along with your mother in law
I should do house hold works
I would like to give birth to a child
intelligent and handsome like you
I don't want anything else in this world.
For the rest of my life,
I will happily live with that child.
What is this, like a child?
Listen.
- Where did you buy this belt?
- Here in Madras only.
Now good products
are manufactured in India.
Got hurt.
Financier Murugan has come
She was working with him.
Just 5 minutes
I will be back in 5 minutes.
- Don't go any where, promise.
- Promise.
What is this?
Are you eating potato?
Wait for 5 minutes
Let your dad come.
Poor guy, seems even on the 1st day
he has lot of work to do
I didn't eat grandma
He has been stuffing his mouth.
- Did you do?
- I feel sleepy, so I did.
Wait for some time, let dad come.
Come, because there were lot of people
I came here.
- Come, why do you feel shy?
- No, like this in garden
I am not used to
outdoor shooting like this.
Then am I like that?
Do you think I am so cheap?
I was not fortunate to marry you
if I can give birth to a child,
tall and intelligent like you...
- Who, oh! Mr. Krishna?
- Who? -He is Mr. Murugan.
Sir, Manju madam asked
at what time, tomorrow you need the car?
Need not come at all
Don't want your association at all.
- Who?
- It is me.
Could not see in the darkness.
Don't worry, I will lock it.
- Kids?
- They are here.
- Had your grub?
- I am old, it doesn't matter.
- Did you eat? -No.
- Shouldn't go to bed on empty stomach.
No, in the party,
I had this chicken and...
Oh! You have finished your dinner!
The kids are waiting for you, in hunger
it is ok, they are young and growing.
One day's fasting won't matter much
You go to bed.
Grandma, give me some more sauce.
Little more of the potato.
- Enough, enough.
- Go to sleep, tomorrow morning...
What is it?
Were you hurt?
- Are you feeling hungry?
- Like to eat? -Hm.
Get up, let us eat.
Are you not feeling thirsty?
You must be feeling thirsty
you have woken up at 5am.
Again you will go to sleep at 6 am.
Then you might
wake up at 8 am or 9 am.
Children would have gone to the school.
Don't think I am counseling
as if you are a kid.
No, you can tell counsel me.
Last night I was enlightened a bit.
- Let me get enlightened fully.
- Gosh! What happened?
That Manju is not a good woman.
What if?
What has it got to do...?
No, no, nothing like what you imagine.
She showed affection to children
and was respectful to you...
Ok, I cannot be a mother in law anymore.
- No, if you also go...
- It is long time since
my daughter expired.
Why should I still be a mother in law?
In his death bed, your dad wanted me
to treat you as my son.
- But I have failed.
- Not that.
Yes it is so, had I been
your mother, when your wife expired.
Next month itself I would have
pestered you to marry again.
- Even now it is not too late.
- No, hereafter I won't...
What if we give an Ad
in the paper in matrimonial column.
People will laugh at me
I have two kids.
No one will laugh at
Especially in this city.
Now I feel greatly relieved
I may not get sleep hereafter.
Would you like to have coffee?
I will bring you coffee.
Today has dawned well for us.
- Give -This is for sir.
- Go, I will take care
I will also look into the accounts.
Because I was also
doing a business at Tanjore.
This business is not like
your betel nut one.
This is a big business
Who is this lady Manju? A worker
if her character is not good
What can I do sir?
You have already done all disturbances.
Get this month's salary
from cashier and get lost.
- Why all this suddenly?
- Don't question me.
We have a dignity for this company
You have spoiled that.
Boss didn't like your
behaviour in yesterday's party.
Did you ask him
how he behaved with me yesterday?
- What are you saying?
- What are you saying?
Sir, what I say is...
Settle her accounts
For that Manju, are you happy sir?
I didn't ask you to dismiss her
I just said her character is not good.
That is most important
when that donkey doesn't have that.
Why should we depend on her?
We will find another donkey.
She has no place in this office
Thankless dog.
You also come
Let us go to the bank.
- Have the passbook.
- No you may go, I have headache.
Yesterday you went without food
When you drink, you must eat well
I won't drink hereafter
That's right, if you hate it, don't do it.
He is surely a fraud
I doubt whether all these companies exist.
When we are all available at Madras
How did you get entrapped to him?
If you wanted to do a business
Won't we come to your help?
At the snap of a finger, you could have
lived like a king at Kaveri banks.
How did you get involved in this?
Before it becomes a serious issue
it would be better to inform police.
You are educated
How did you give power of attorney to him?
That is my mistake
She cautioned me at the outset itself.
Forget it, bank passbooks are with him
Can we...
- Sir -Who?
- You wait here, Kaveri, who is there?
If we draw out the money?
- Give it to me.
- Careful.
Sorry, tell me.
She has a point, if we go to police,
complaint, the account will be frozen
it will become complicated.
You do one thing, when you
get money from the bank, contact me.
Have this
Throw them away sir
I have a case at Saidapet
I will come after attending to it.
Have I given you my phone number?
I have it in my diary
I will read
I will.
- Keep the letter safely.
- Bye! -OK
I have given
the betel nut factory as guarantee
I am worried about that.
Nothing to worry about
if you make moves quickly.
We can tackle it just like that.
- Shall I make a move?
- Sir your fees... -Keep quiet sir.
Bye mother.
Oh God! nothing will happen.
Saw your matrimonial Ad
My name is Yamuna.
Working as a nurse in an hospital.
My height is 5 ft 3½ inches
Studied up to plus 2.
Bring it here
Don't give it.
Don't give it
Bring it here.
Catch her
Run fast.
You might fall.
Don't chase them.
Careful.
- Tiger, come here.
- I stopped for Barani.
Kaveri, give it to me.
Dad, I like this Yamuna.
Grandma likes her
I also like her.
After your marriage
get me married dad.
Ah! will give a matrimonial Ad
for you also in paper.
Groom is 2 ½ of feet tall,
with running nose and a dull head.
- Dad, he is beating me.
- Both of you go out, talking too much.
Don't you know elders are discussing
They have made our job easier
I was wondering how to explain this...
I have to go to the bank
Forgot about it.
- I will be back for the lunch.
- OK
I saw and liked
But should like to see once again.
Yes, I and children
seeing it is not enough.
You check and decide it for yourself.
Keep it with you
there is one more copy.
Do you want it?
Bye.
- I will be back now,
wait here -OK sir.
Sir, wait.
Oh God! The vehicle has gone.
Please leave me sir.
What madam, are you trying to
run away with the money?
- How much is in the suitcase?
- How much is in your suitcase?
My box contains lot of space
To take back the money swindled by you
I will open
See thoroughly.
My box is also empty
He has cheated both of us.
- This is just Rs 5000 only.
- What else?
Sir, I have worked
in a chit company earlier.
The situation is very bad outside
if you go out, they will beat you to death.
- How much money you have?
- Just 5000.
Give that 5000 to me
I will go out and keep them at bay.
- You just manage to escape from here.
- Yes Krishnasamy.
Give it to me. If you go out,
it will become worse for you.
Why all of you threaten me
what mistake have I done?
Why should I dread them?
Take off your hand
I am telling this for your own good
I know what is good and bad for me
You may go.
Go, if I inform the police
it will become alright.
You go now
Don't do it sir.
We have not done any wrong
We need not apprehend like this.
They have become bankrupt
No one will get their money.
You were all taken for a ride.
We won't let him go
We will not spare him.
Come out!
Wait, wait, don't get excited
I am going to call the police now.
You have to answer us
Are you trying to escape?
I am not running away
All of you may come and sit inside.
We can all sit together,
until police comes.
Sir don't believe him
He will sneak out silently.
When I told him not to
loot the public money.
He has necked me out.
You servant, how dare you
talk to me in singular?
How do you manhandle him?
Take off your hands
will you keep your hands on me?
You. . wait...
Don't leave him.
My wrist watch.
Is he running an office?
Hit him.
Throw him down.
Dad...
Son in law.
Superintendent has called me
I will be back now.
- Where are they going?
- Krishna, come let us go -Where?
You come with me,
I will tell you.
Come otherwise, the remission will be cut.
- Remission?
- I will tell you later, come -Where?
Come on.
Oh God!
He is beating a...
- Leave me.
- What a smoke!
I can't see anything
My eyes are burning.
What is the noise?
- Get up.
- What is going on there?
- Why is it all strewn like this?
- Sir, he..
Nothing sir, When I was taking rice
He fell on me.
The rice has spilled all over the place.
What...?
Go and wash your face, go.
Go on.
Why do you waste
the government money like this?
No sir...
Go, wash and clean up the place
incorrigible guy.
Go.
Go.
Come in queue.
Go.
Go man.
These are the unwritten laws of a prison
if you oppose then remission will be cut.
Do you know what is a remission?
Your punishment period will be halved.
Yours is 4 years. it would be OK,
if you serve for 2 years term.
For Gandhi's birthday,
CM's birthday you will get some remission.
With the jailor's mercy and the guy
who fought now Thulukanam's mercy.
You can leave this place
with just 30% punishment.
So you should not interfere in anything.
Keep your mouth and that, shut
How can I remain silent?
Why should I be silent?
This is atrocious.
Why should we worry about all this?
If he died due to his hits...
someone should question...
- Who is sitting there?
- He has come.
What lyer, your follower has lot of
empathy and compassion
- ls his name Mahatma Gandhi?
- No, Krishnasamy.
Because you cook in the cell
You have become impudent
if your disciple also
becomes impudent like you
it will become difficult.
You are too thin, eat
You may eat.
Go
I haven't consumed it,
you may eat it.
Look hero.
This is food for eating
yes, I will keep it in it's due place, eat.
What is this?
No need for brotherly affection
One day's fasting won't make lyer thin.
What is this?
Wait, let me and go and
see whether I can get something to eat.
- Warden -No use Krishna,
Thulukanam is a terrific guy.
He has decided to torment me
Will he allow me some respite?
I can't bear it
Such a pain!
- I can't bear it.
- What is this?
I can't bear the stomach ache.
Wait sir.
What is this?
Oh God!
- Is anybody there?
- Iyer is not well -Nothing will happen.
Pray for me,
that is the only way out.
Sir, come
lyer is not well, come.
Don't beat him.
Krishna, are you alright?
Nothing wrong with me
You lie down please.
Oh God! what an atrocity is this?
Open the gate.
Are you all ok?
Does anyone have any grievance?
In case of any grievance, come out boldly.
You need not have any apprehension.
- What is it? -Nothing sir,
lyer is not feeling well, is it not?
Sir, yesterday lyer was not given food.
His food was thrown into the toilet.
Throughout night he suffered a lot
When we asked for medicine, I was also...
it is alright...
But if he is beaten, he might die.
Now I feel slightly better.
What is this?
Do you want a remission cut?
You have 6 more years left. If remission
is cut, it will become 8 years.
Thought you have changed
what happened to you?
Sir, I didn't know about all this
Thought they were kidding.
- No sir and he...
- Shut up!
- Arrange for medical aid to him.
- Yes sir.
Sit down.
- Come.
- You come with me
I have written to higher ups
for reducing your punishment.
But you behave according to
your whims and fancies.
Get up, all of you.
From this day onwards
forget about opposing me.
Here this white dress rules
and not the Khaki uniform.
Have you understood?
If you value your life, follow our rules.
When we go out,
they will ask you 'What happened?'
You should tell them
'I slipped down'
That is our convention and rule
Understood?
Say, you have understood.
What is going on here?
What happened?
What happened?
Am I not asking you?
Why are you blinking?
- I slipped down.
- What?
- I slipped down.
- Alright, go.
- Have you come earlier this time?
- Last time I couldn't talk anything.
So I came early.
Send them in, come.
Go.
Seems Karuppiah is drinking too much.
Dad, grandma
Dad is here, dad.
Son in law, why is your face like this?
- I slipped down.
- Eh? -I SLIPPED DOWN
it is mossy here, hence he slipped.
Careful, if anything happens to you...
The children are fine
You don't worry about them.
- Yes dad.
- Yes dad, Tiger is also fine
it is vegetarian
it eats buttermilk rice and shakes hand
I can't talk loudly
My throat is choking
if you want to convey anything
to children, tell them.
- Study well.
- Eh?
STUDY WELL,
listen to grandma's advice.
What you said is correct
There is no regard for respect in city.
Those who have brought parcels,
give and move this side.
Oh God! I didn't bring anything
I thought they won't allow this.
- I told you it is written in the form.
- It is alright, next time...
Krishna come here.
She is my daughter Yamuna, she is a nurse
He is Krishna who saved my life.
- Thanks a lot.
- Dad, she is the one, nurse.
- Keep quiet.
- Look at this.
Look here.
- Sorry, children mistook
with the photo -it is OK.
You are everything to dad
I don't know how to thank you
I will take care of them
This photo, are you Krishnasamy?
Go, don't stay here.
God's ways are inexplicable
See how he connects people.
Greetings madam,
I am Panchapakesan.
- They call me lyer -Iyer, go man.
- Saw your matrimonial ad..
That was me,
I wrote to you before coming here
it is getting late, go man.
Bye.
Sit down.
- Would you like to have coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Grandma, I will prepare.
- Kaveri, be careful.
We have to set right that
if it rains it will be difficult.
Earlier we had the entire house.
Now we have let out a portion
We get some money out of it
it was all stopped by him.
Yes they have taken away TV and fridge
for not paying the instalments.
Don't blabber everything to everyone
it is alright
He has told only me.
- Why did you let this out?
- It won't bite grandma.
Let it be here for sometime.
Heard you are diabetic
who is treating you?
Who will treat me?
I used to take treatment earlier.
Now I don't use sugar at all.
Lot of abscesses are there on my back
They are painful
I faint frequently.
Oh God! From tomorrow,
visit our hospital at least once a week
I will come and pick you up
Take this tablet.
Kaveri, bring some water.
Hold it,
the dog downstairs might bite it.
- Kaveri bring water.
- Grandma -Oh God!
Kaveri, what happened?
- Grandma.
- Tell me.
What happened to Kaveri?
Has she fallen down?
Come here
Listen to me.
- What is your dog's name?
- Tiger -Is it?
- Touch it.
- No, it will bite me.
Yamuna, come here.
- You wait there.
- Why?
If you come inside I will smack you.
We are staying close-by
But you are coming from a far off place.
There is some convenience in coming last.
- You won't get
trampled in the crowd -Dad.
- Where is Kaveri?
- She is here.
What is this?
Dots on forehead, half sari.
Yes.
When?
The day when we came here last
Last week when came here.
In the half yearly exams,
she has come ranked first.
- Dad, I have secured 4th rank.
- Why?
There are 3 students
intelligent than me
if I somehow beat them
I will come first.
But I have come first in sports.
Yes, he has good aptitude
for sports than studies.
Both the children study well.
Yamuna said,
you need not serve the full term.
Says you will be
released in 2 years time
I have vowed to shave off my hair
at Tirupathi for your early release.
Yamuna visits us frequently
and takes care of us.
Now I don't use injections
I take tablets.
You need not worry about us
We are living happily.
Grandma.
Dad I am learning typewriting
I have joined on her advise.
After type writing I will learn computers.
She is helping us a lot
Rent did not come on time, so..
Have you let out the house?
But we are happy, had no other go.
Yamuna takes care of us frequently.
- We are indebted to Yamuna.
- Please go.
Dad, have this Tirunelveli Halwa
- if you consume little,
it will last for 3 days, -Give me.
Dad next time
I will bring tiger also.
- Yamuna, many thanks.
- Eh?
- MANY THANKS.
- Don't mention, it is my duty.
Whether you like it or not
Now we are relatives.
Madam, what is this?
Why do you talk here and there?
Are you related?
Have you applied for visit?
Only 3 persons are allowed.
Is it?
OK then.
Anyway rules are rules
Give an application for interview.
You will get a legal permission.
This is our relation
we are in love and are about to be married.
So want to meet him, write like this.
- Have you understood?
- Where should I give it sir?
In the front office.
Last time I couldn't talk anything
So I came early
ls also in person?
Have they checked it all?
What is this in your hand?
Does this come in special post?
- What is the letter?
- Personal letter.
Will you go without showing it to me?
- What's happening here?
- Morning sir, coming after the interview.
Is it not over?
Go.
Don't get into altercation with him
Have you understood?
Once I am released
I will get everything ready fast.
Without much expenses
we can celebrate the marriage.
What do you say?
All these days I addressed you in singular.
Now you are going to become my son in law.
How should I call you?
Krishna or Krishna sir?
Son in law or Son in law sir?
Am I talking too much?
Ok, good night.
Who is it?
Who?
Krishna what happened?
- Look at this.
- Krishna put it down, it is muck.
What is this?
Krishna come here.
Come here.
Wash your hands.
Wash, remission will go
Control your temper.
What is this, Sinners
Look, what all they do!
- Lyer, the flavor is so captivating
Is it sambar? -Yes.
- What is this?
- This is asafoetida.
Why does it smell like pee?
Why should we have
esteem, pride and anger?
We want to be released
When you are angry, count up to 10
it will all become alright
12345678910
Has your rage disppeared?
When you are not peaceful
you can never be comfortable.
Here, keep this there.
- What Pitchai.
- Greetings brother.
- What happened to Govindan?
- I don't know.
Does it happen without your knowledge?
Really I don't know.
- What is my name?
- I don't know.
- Hey!
- Thulukkanam
I just wanted to check.
Continue your work.
- Krishna.
- lyer, don't go there.
Don't go lyer.
They are fighting
Don't go there
it is hot.
Stab him.
Don't stab him.
Lakshmanan is coming.
Thulukanam, what is this?
What happened?
- I slipped down.
- Slipped...
Go and see the doctor.
INTERMISSION
- Greetings sir.
- Greetings.
Greetings leader.
Come.
Walk fast.
- What are you going to do?
- Sir.
Someone should shoulder the responsibility.
The trafficking has come to a stop
Festivals are also fast approaching.
Don't spoil our revenue in your fights.
- Have you understood?
- No I haven't understood.
Don't try to act smart?
When you have become the leader..
. . You have to shoulder the responsibility
I will give the same share I gave to him.
But work should go on, that is all.
Bidi, cigarette and
liquor stocks have piled up.
This is dangerous.
Shall we negotiate and
come to a conclusion quickly?
Are you asking me to
become a partner to the..
Bidi, cigarette and liquor business?
Yes.
People out there believe that
the inmates are reformed here
I too believe so
I am not interested in your business.
- So do you mean
there should be no business? -Yes.
You don't allow him to do
and you also don't do.
For you to become a holy fellow
should I be suffer hunger?
You need not
Limit yourself to the salary you get.
At least your paunch will reduce.
Look, I want to go home.
You don't disturb me
I will not also disturb you.
Have you understood?
Talk with respect,
or else you will be trampled.
You are a criminal in uniform
I don't have that uniform.
That's all, what respect you deserve?
If you lay your hands on me again
I will complain to the jailor
Understood?
- What Lakshmana?
- He says he will complain to jailor
I am going to preempt that
and complain against him.
See what happens afterwards.
- Witness for that?
- You.
Say that he has beaten me all over.
How will the jailor believe
when there is no signs of that?
That is also right
Do it the way he will believe.
Next week, we have celebrations at home.
Do it carefully.
Where is he?
Get up, come
what for?
Beat him
Sir, why are you beating me?
What did I do?
Krishna, why are they beating you?
Go.
Are you a mafia don?
Are you running this jail or is that me?
- I don't follow you sir.
- Haven't you understood?
Come here, explain in such a way
that others understand, don't be afraid.
Can't bear his atrocities sir.
Convict warden Thulukanam
was beaten by him..
. . For not becoming an
associate of his business.
Don't tell lies.
You are a prisoner and he is a cop.
- Behave properly.
- Yes sir.
In front of you,
he behaves like this
illicit arrack, Bidi it is all there
Because we questioned him.
He has done like this.
Sir you know about me
Please tell him about me.
What Muthusami?
Sir.
- Are you his partner?
- Sir I am very honest, you know about it.
- Then do you say he is exemplary?
- As far as I know...
He is trafficking narcotics
concealed in halwa.
When Thulukanam questioned this
he was assaulted
lyer has a daughter
Muthusamy is the pimp for the girl and him.
Are you beating the cop?
I will take care of him.
Come out, shouldn't have
any external injury, careful.
Sir one minute.
Sir.
Turn him to the other side and hit.
Sir.
Are you hitting the cops?
Do you have any sense?
What did he say?
Shouldn't have any external injury.
Krishna, I am released today.
Had you not caused troubles.
In 2 week's time you would also
have been released.
Those who are patient rule the land
You have spoiled it all
- lyer.
- Bye Krishna.
Many thanks, Krishna.
Had you said lie
unable to bear the torture
I would have lost my job
I could not help you.
Jailor has cut your remission
Be patient.
Now a days, more than
honesty, patience is a virtue.
Bharathi's poems
Have it.
What is this?
Why are you removing all this?
What else can I do?
You have not paid the installments
and are not vacating the house too.
You always claim, he will be released.
Seems he will not come now.
Then are we to go to the streets?
You have not paid the installments.
The tenant has agreed to buy the house.
But he was firm
that you can't stay here.
We can't do anything madam.
Is this the gratitude, he is
showing for letting out the house?
Look madam,
you can't talk all these to him.
The house is in Dhanush sir's name.
He has also not paid the amount
He says he don't want the house.
Who is he to say, he doesn't want?
What about our money?
We don't know all those details.
By his contacts,
he can even close our company.
We can't do anything opposing him
if you want, you may talk to him directly.
Come.
- What you want?
- Is Dhanush there?
He is here
Who are you?
Tell him I am the old partner
He will know.
- Please be seated -Where is he now?
- He is inside, I will inform him.
- Will you prosper?
- Who?
I am asking, will you prosper?
You have sent my son in law to jail.
We live with difficulty in a place.
What do you gain by
driving out us to the streets?
What wrong have we done?
Are you going to leave this place or not?
What are you doing here?
Will you not check who is coming in?
Were you plucking your...?
Sorry sir, said she is a partner, so...
Clod partner, push them out.
Done all wrongs,
fortunately I was not jailed.
Send them out
crooked donkey!
Who is the crooked donkey?
Go out.
Grandma.
After taking tablets you should
consume food but you are sleeping
I am hungry
Stop near that hotel.
Shall I stop?
Kaveri, your grandma is sick.
- Sister, Nurse Yamuna.
- She is working here only.
This lady requires another
bottle of glucose, will you get it?
Are there no grown-ups at home?
Why kids have come?
- Are you known to Yamuna?
- No -She is our relative.
Relative?
Alright you have to get medicines.
The Chief doctor will come now
Ask your elders to come with cash.
This vehicle...
- Shall we go?
- Yes, go.
- Now what?
- Go to Central Jail.
- Yes, uncle, Grandma is unwell.
- Do you think this is a charity home?
Not as charity
Give me some job.
Yes sir, Dhanush speaking
Long time since I am hearing your voice.
Is it?
If I tell you, you will not believe
You are really lucky.
A fresh candidate has come.
Not like last time
Last time she cheated you.
But this time it will not happen.
Age? What is your age?
- 12 ½, tell 13 -12.
You have come for a job
You have got it.
- Sir, 12, I swear it is 12
- Uncle, I have passed typewriting lower.
Have you passed lower?
Nothing sir
She has passed Typewriting lower
I will come
I know, I will definitely come
ls Lower not sufficient?
Do they want Higher also?
I don't know
what you have passed or failed..
. . But the dame luck has
made you come out in first division.
- Is it enough?
- Girl is fresh and green.
- No, she is a red girl.
- Have you not understood? -No
if you are happy, I am happy
I have talked to the hospital authorities.
You have your food peacefully.
Take this boy to the hospital
and take care of his grandma.
- Poor lady -I will also go now
and report for work from tomorrow.
No, sit down
Your work starts from today.
- Should not stop eating half way, eat.
- I have finished.
- Do not tell lies.
- Do not tell lies.
Dhanush, go.
- After you eat, I will take you
to the hospital -Yes sir -Come.
Sir, next time please allow
my Tiger also to come in.
He is referring to his pet dog
Come.
- Eat.
- This is enough.
What, have you stolen it? Go
I will..
Don't beat Tiger.
Committing deeds that grieve others
Age showing up with grey hair.
Later becoming a prey
to the God of Death and vanish.
Like those mirthful persons
Did you believe I will also fall?
Make me a fresh soul.
Enlighten my intellect and
Make me ecstatic for ever.
Make me ecstatic for ever.
Souls with self-esteem
can never be humbled.
Lightning does not make
the sky crash on earth.
Was brought up at
the banks of river Cauvery.
Does not fall like a snapped kite.
Will build a nest full of
Affection and dance with merry
I am looking for my good old days.
What Bharathi said those days
have never failed
I have never accepted defeat.
Subtitles by. .:: MaGeSh::..
It is all destiny but still
God should not test you like this.
There should be a limit to all this.
Oh God! This is more than enough.
- We have no strength to bear anymore.
- Dad.
Coffee for you.
Listen, where are you going?
Oh God!
- Dad, he is going somewhere.
- Who?
Where is he going?
Where are you going?
- Who are you sir?
What do you want? -ls Dhanush there?
Sir doesn't meet anyone at home
Meet him at office.
- He will meet me.
- Is it so?
Name? Do you have a card?
Will give it, when he comes.
- When will he come?
- He will come at 1'o'clock.
- You?
- His partner.
Oh! Is it you?
I couldn't recognise you immediately.
Have you come to create troubles?
Go away.
Brother, I have not
come to create problems
I am going to my place
I need some money.
Tell Dhanush to give, what is due to me...
Due to you. .? You have already
amassed, cheating the public, go man
I have not come to create problems
Talk with respect.
Should I give respect?
Go away.
Krishna, get into the vehicle
I say get in.
Do not try to retaliate
and land in jail again
I did not go for revenge
but for money, he was discourteous.
Did you go there for money?
Will he give if you ask?
Don't think he is the same old Dhanush.
Earlier he was an ordinary pimp
Now he is a pimp for politicians.
Now people like him have respect
rather than people in uniform like us.
- Why?
- What do you mean by why?
I am like this and
he is prosperous, why?
- God will punish him.
- Damn it!
The God is a silent spectator
and the law also keeps mum.
But I am punished, why?
Is it because I was honest?
This question has popped up
in my mind also many times.
Honest people like us
have no respect here
I have wondered how people
who support harlotry get all respects?
But if you think about it deeply
No one can claim, he is honest now.
You can claim the other guy
is more wicked than you.
These days no one can claim
he is the most honest guy.
- I... -Wait, you would have
bought tickets from hawks for cinema.
You would have bribed
the TTR for tickets in Railway.
There can be no one in this country
who doesn't know about black money.
That means all of us
are accomplices to this.
When the situation is like this..
Only Politicians and
Police alone are rebuked.
He can also retort back
You have no rights to talk about this..
. . Since you exercise
franchise after getting gifts.
Avenging people like Dhanush
is only fictitious and not practical.
We should be careful to avoid stains
on shirt when the gutter water splashes..
. . And should not attempt
to clean the gutter.
- My shirt only has got stained.
- What?
- What is the term of a life sentence?
- Why are you asking?
My goodness!
Why this misdirected thinking?
Do not allow this to grow
You have just now come out of prison
I am appalled
Come let us go to temple.
- These thoughts should not
come to you -Why?
Because if people
resort to murder in rage..
. . And start calculating
remissions in prisons.
Then it will be river of blood everywhere.
- Must be serene -if I remain serene,
will the rivers get purified?
Because good people remain serene
such gutters pollute the rivers.
Gutter is a residue
But river of blood is a great sin.
What is this? Come, let us go
it is a rotten stench.
Stay and enjoy
Is it something new?
In any case, you don't bother about it.
When you chant hymns in prayer room
gold coins will shower on you.
Don't generalise, because of one guy
The society is...
You should then keep it
like your prayer room.
Since it is like a gutter,
everyone pollutes it...
. . thinking that
it may not make a difference.
- I am also going to follow them.
- Then what about future?
What future?
Who is there for me? No one.
Why, no one?
Forget me, what about Yamuna?
Sorry lyer, in my rage... who is there
for me other than you in this world?
- Why? -I have lost faith over
this world and these people.
Now I understand
why Kannagi burnt Madurai?
Nothing wrong in using
atom bombs and nuclear bombs..
. . As there would be very few
good people among those who die.
All of you clap once
See he has climbed to the top.
What are you staring at?
Clap hands.
See, now he takes off his hands
Very good! Clap again.
Now he will stand in the rope
Give applause.
Dad.
Applaud man.
Clap hands...
Well done dear! Wait!
This is the Gujarat girl.
This is my first wife and
she is my second wife.
This is the American dog
Greet everyone, greet
- ignore it
Dog is not in good mood -Dad.
Dad.
Applaud, now the world
will look upside down.
Whistle!
Watch me.
Dad.
Hey! you.
Master!
Why dad?
Without knowing all these...
I was hasty... forgive me.
Leave it, had I been in your stage
I would also have done the same thing.
- What did you say is your name?
- Mannankatty
I only asked your name,
why do you get angry?
- Sir, his name is Mannankatty.
- Yes, that is my name.
- Is it a pseudonym?
- Dear, food is ready.
Barani, go and eat.
- Should we do... any...?
- Eh?
Amidst great difficulty,
you have taken care of him.
Should we do any monetary...?
I don't have any difficulty
it is sky above and earth below for me
it is all for people like you.
Had anyone else said this
I would have smacked him by now.
- Your age has saved you.
- I apologise on his behalf.
The mistake is on my part
Forgive me.
- Mistake is mine too.
- I told you it is my mistake!!
Come close
After food he will sleep...
if you take him away while he is asleep
The tragic scene of weeping would be saved.
Else he would cry
seeing that my wife would cry.
All my children would weep
I will...
- Are you not coming?
- I am coming, we have guests.
- You may go and eat - I have
bought from hotel specially for you.
- Will you eat in my house?
- What are you saying?
Will I not eat the food
which my consumed for 2 years?
If you have any objection,
tell me, I won't eat.
Nothing of that sort,
come let us eat, come sir.
No, today I take food only once
Besides I am a vegetarian.
Banana chop in the plate
will look like a fish to me.
- So you won't eat, it is OK
You come, let us eat -Let me eat.
The mind feels glad
on getting the craved one.
Why does it become sad
when losing possession?
The mind feels glad
on getting the craved one.
Why does it become sad
when losing possession?
As the dusk culminate in tears.
As the dawn breaks with delight.
A migratory bird from somewhere.
Stretched it's wings
to establish relation here.
The mind can't bear it.
The mind so sorrowed doesn't hate it.
Though we have seen
conjuring tricks everyday.
We have never seen such a trick.

Is this Barani?
Subtitles by. .:: MaGeSh::..
I am coming dad.
- Did you see my specs?
- One minute.
Barani has woken up
Ask him what he wants?
Brush your teeth and...
What would you like to have?
- Do you have 'paya'?
- Paya? What do you mean?
Lamb chop soup
Don't feel bad, I was just kidding.
Don't I know that
you are a vegetarian?
What is this?
He talks in Madras accent so fluently.
What else?
Where is grandma dad?
You all admitted her in hospital
There...
We prayed but God said,
'Let her come and stay here for sometime'
Is she dead?
Sister!!
Where is sister?
Is she not here?
Then she must be with Dhanush uncle.
Dhanush uncle got her a job
He even gave money.
Then tiger started running on the road
I chased it.
- Who is it? -Who is Krishna?
- Whom do you want to meet?
- He is the guy.
- It is me, what do you want? -Come here.
Oh God!
Who are you?
Why do you beat him?
Dad
I can't understand that is happening here.
Dad.
Heard you came to
the house and threatened?
Syed told me.
Are you a big gun,
if you are out from jail?
No, I have not come to create problem
I am going to my place
it is enough
I have found my son
Heard you got a job for my daughter.
- I know that.
- Do you know that too?
He has come with information
He has contacts with the police.
- Yesterday too, he came with police.
- Police, who is it, SP or Commissioner?
Let him be anybody, I won't panic
I too know many people.
- What I am... -Throw this
scoundrel out, if he dies no one loses.
- Earth will be relieved of his weight.
- Tell me where is my daughter.
- I am not asking you anything else.
- Leave me.
- Please tell me, else.
- Go...
Else, will you pluck my hairs?
Do you want to know
whereabouts of your daughter?
Your daughter is working in Calcutta
Sent by Venkatachalam
Calcutta, Sona Ganj.
Do you know Sona Ganj?
Don't you know?
Be quick.
What Krishna, at this time?
I and Krishna will return from
Calcutta as quickly as possible.
Yamuna feels,
you should not go to Calcutta alone.
That is right also.
Yes dad, what she says is right
impertinent bastard,
if you don't have change..
- Why do you trouble me early morning?
- Tamil!
Sir, greetings.
- Are you new to Calcutta?
- Yes.
- Then how do you know Sona Ganj?
- They gave the address.
We have come
in search of my son in law's girl.
- Is he your son in law?
- Yes.
First time I am seeing
Father in law and Son in law..
- . . Going together to Sona Ganj.
- Why?
- Do you know about this place Sona Ganj?
- Don't know, what is it?
I am going, if I stay here,
they will note down my vehicle number
I have just told them you are a customer.
- What is the age?
- 13, it is 13 only
I have to take my vehicle.
Come.
Keep your bags here.
Do not worry
it will be safe here.
Come in.
How about her?
- Please come.
- Greet them -Greetings!
Come.
Give me money.
Go away.
- My share?
- Here, have it.
OK
God won't desert us like that.
Our child won't be here.
She might be doing
domestic chores somewhere.
Dad.
Krishna come.
- Dad.
- Oh God!
Why such a hard time?
Krishna, come
Run fast.
Run, they are all after you.
Go fast.
Leave him,
why are you beating him?
What are you doing?
Don't beat him
Listen, he is the girl's dad.
Please understand
I beg you, please don't...
Oh God! What is this?
They are beating you.
- Someone is trying to steal a girl.
- Are they women?
- Is he a Tamil?
- Yes, Tamil
I have been telling you
why don't you understand?
Don't beat him
See madam, they are all beating him.
- Are you a Tamil?
- Goddess you should save us.
Look this girl's dad has come here.
Someone brought her here after kidnapping.
We have come to retrieve her
You must help us madam.
Is he your dad?
Be quiet.
- What does he say?
- To release your girl he asks Rs 5000.
- Dirty bastard.
- We don't have 5000, have just 2000.
Why should you give money
to take your daughter home?
We will give it to these pimps
if we do overtime for 7 days, 5000 Rs
if we 7 of us join together now, here.
We can give RS 5000.
You can take your daughter now.
Why do you hold my feet
Take your daughter away.
We have been brought here
by fathers, brothers and husbands.
We too prayed to all the Gods
But no one came to rescue us.
Kaveri is really lucky.
Smile, your God has come to take you back.
- Jalaja -What mom?
- Nothing to be afraid of.
She is my daughter,
Jalaja, she was born here.
Kaveri's dad, he has come to take her home
I know, I have seen his photo.
Dad, Kaveri has told a lot about you.
Thank you dad.

Somewhere in distance in an
unknown direction goes my life's canoe.
Once I departed
from the banks of Cauvery.
My eyes have witnessed
all the unseen agonies.
The parrot I grew has gone.
Took so long to have a good glance.
Oh dear honey, dad's love has won.
Oh dear flower!
The sorrow has come to an end
I realise the truth
when I see the river Ganga.
River Ganga get polluted
as people take bath.
Many sinners get cleansed here.
Where should I explain
and cry about these foolishness.
Krishna one minute.
Murugesh, get fags from Chettiar's shop
Already bought it dad.
Is it? Get some bananas
I didn't want to
tell you as soon as you came.
- Tell me -For past 5 days
I have not reported to duty
I am on leave
Thanks for the help you have...
But tomorrow I am going for work
I cannot help you in uniform
Murder case is booked on you.
Murder case on me?
Whom did I kill?
Whatever you say
a case has been registered against you.
You have beaten Venkatachalam's men.
Through mercenaries
and there are witnesses.
- Your name is there in the FIR.
- Do you believe that?
It would be better for you to surrender.
Legal actions can be initiated then easily.
On whose legal terms
I have no means
I can't safeguard myself,
leave alone the truth.
Decide yourself,
whether to surrender or not?
Tomorrow when I go for duty
you should not be...
You should not be under my protection
I can do only this much.
- OK.
- Don't mistake me please
I will go tomorrow morning.
What?
What happened?
Enough, leave me.
Leave me bastards
How many customers on a day?
Am I a machine?
Oh God!
We can't erase these dreams of Kaveri
it will surface again and again.
See what they have done to my daughter.
There are lot of girls like Kaveri
I can't bear it
it is good, you haven't come there
it is good her mother is not alive
She can't bear this sight.
What sin I have committed?
This punishment is for what sin of mine.
You have not committed any sin.
What happened to this God?
All innocent people are punished.
Wrong doer's go scot-free.
'Satyameva Jayathe'
cannot be followed in life
I have seen it everywhere.
Why did they brought me up
asking not to lie ever?
What for I was brought up to live like
Rama and Gandhi?
Is it to finally lose
the battle to these pimps?
A wicked guy gets
all respects due for a good man, how?
This world offers respect
to a scoundrel on a platter.
First time I went to jail
without doing any wrong.
This time that mistake shouldn't happen
I told you, I will marry you
Once I retrieve my children
I will surely honour that.
But for my sake
if I ask you to wait for some time.
Will you do it?
surely.
- Even if it means 8 years.
- Can wait until my death.
Why 8 years?
What do you mean?
I am going to do a good job
Don't prevent me
I am afraid
No, don't do, don't be hasty.
- No.
- I have decided after deep thinking.
- No, I am afraid -Don't be.
- I shouldn't advise you.
You know about it
Let me consult dad.
Take the children to your house
I need not worry now.
Don't do.
Thanks.
We have to fix date
for temple celebrations.
Will inform you once it is decided.
Want to invite national level leaders.
They attend temple celebrations
without fail.
Temple 'prasad'
Give it to your child.
We had conducted
the prayer for the first child.
There were no problems in delivery
it will be so this time too
Good omen, bell is ringing.
Sir Dhanush is on the line
Hold it for some time.
- He says it is important.
- We will take leave of you sir.
- Don't mistake me.
- Bye.
- Bye!
- Bye!
It is me, tell me
Suffering from cold?
Voice is different
What is the age?
Is it fresh?
I have an important work.
Around 11'o'clock,
book a room in our hotel suite.
Yes, our... hotel
Don't disclose my name
I have talked, but there will be
lot of men around him.
You can't reach near him
Why, didn't you reach him?
Don't do
Do you want to go to jail again?
I will talk to him and
get a big amount as compensation.
Looks like his car
He normally comes at this time.
Keep it with you, for defense.
Even if you kill him
I will be with you.
Yes, he may not expect you
He will be expecting a 12 year old girl.
Who?
Are you Dhanush's man?
Where is Dhanush?
By this time he would have died.
Who are you? Talking impudently.
Why did you come here?
To see you for the
last time and kill you also.
Do you know,
to whom you are talking?
I know, the big man
who ripens the tender ones.
Which girl's dad are you?
So, are there countless girls?
- Kaveri, do you remember?
- That chit fund...
Alright, tell me, how much money you want?
- I will give -Do you think,
you can buy anything with money?
Look, Dhanush is supplying all these girls.
Take revenge on him.
Dhanush is having a butcher shop.
But you only ask for tender meat.
He is the supplier
But you are the one who demands
I have studied in Tamil medium
Talk in Tamil.
Ok, tell me what do you want?
I want your life
I want to see you lying as a corpse.
Do you know Sona Ganj?
How will you not know?
Have you gone there?
I went there.
Lot of young girls
All garbage thrown by you have become
a mound there, Venkatachalam.
Beat, before you die
if I die, I have nothing to lose
except my grief.
But if you die, you will lose
this heaven built by you.
Lift me up.
Lift me.
Lift me, don't do it.
Don't do
if I die, you will also die, lift me.
Lift me.
Commiting deeds that grieve others.
Age showing up with grey hair.
Later becoming a prey
to the God of Death and vanish.
Like those mirthful persons.
Did you believe I will also fall?
I want to ask you few boons.
Bestow them straight to me today.
Resultant actions on
the evil deeds of my previous birth.
Should remain stifled.
Make me a fresh soul sans distress.
Enlighten my intellect and
Make me ecstatic for ever.
Make me ecstatic for ever.
Come, don't feel shy.
- Mom, go near him.
- I will hit you.
Come, in law.
- Who is this?
- Who is this?
- Who?
- Grandpa.
Thai Pongal festival has
come and milk is boiling, sing a song.
Praise the great river
where colourful women dance.
This Ponni is the mother of love
for the southerners.
She is a Goddess clad in water.
