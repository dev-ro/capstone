- Bombs!
- They're bombing us!
Rosetta !
Rosetta ! Rosetta !
Oh, my God, she's going to die!
Arnaldo, get me some water.
Will you get me a glass of water!
Rosetta !
Signora...
Please, Rosetta.
try to drink some water.
It's all over, they are gone. We'll be all right.
Look at me, look at Mamma.
They are gone, drink.
Please, drink.
- Mamma !
- Rosetta !
You see, Mamma was right, they are really gone.
Please don't cry, my darling.
We've got to close the shop
and get out of Rome. But don't cry.
It's all over. They're gone.
If I was a man, I would shoot them all!
They're dirty murderers!
- Want me to open up?
- Sure, sure!
- I can't. It's all out of shape.
- It's all over, Rosetta. You can thank the good Lord
Madonna, look at the smoke!
That's my house!
Arnaldo, what's happened?
They hit one of the houses down the street.
A lot of smoke from the Tiburtino!
Here the ledge over the door came down.
''His Imperial Majesty has arranged to give the governor
of Rome a relief fund of one million lire''
- Who, the Pope?
- Of course not.
''His Imperial Majesty arranged
to give the governor of Rome ...''
''.All the people Count Sforza
said yesterday in his timely speech
have welcomed with dignity and courage
the severe test to which
they have been submitted.
His Holiness, Pope Pius XII has sent
a telegram to President Roosevelt...''
Giovanni, you've got to help me out.
- I want my daughter out of Rome.
- It's all right, sit down.
She has a weak heart,
I'm afraid she might have an attack.
- You'll go where?
- Away from Rome!
- Those lunatics will come again,
even the Pope they don't respect.
- Fine! Then the war will be over sooner, maybe.
- Oh, are you crazy or something? We'll all be killed!
- What's Mussolini doing?
- That's what I'd like to know, that madman!
- He's got to say something.
- You women will believe anything.
Before they came to bomb us,
we weren't doing so bad Business was good.
- Oh!  Sure, it was.
- I'll leave you the keys to the store.
You might look in now and then
and check the house, too.
- If you trust me...
- Sure.
We'll make up an inventory,
just between friends.
- Buonanni will buy the stuff that might go bad.
- I'm sorry you're going.
- Why don't you get away?
- What will I use for money, Cesira?
- It would only be for a few weeks,
no more. Isn't it? - Sure.
- Take this to Covelli. Come back in an hour.
- Why an hour? - An hour.
If something had happened to Rosetta
I would have murdered someone.
Who would you have murdered?
I'm wasting your time, Giovanni.
I'd do anything for you.
I know, you were a good
friend to my husband.
I wouldn’t get my finger out, for that bastard.
But then you're just as two faced as all the others!
Weren’t you like brothers?
Come on, you were with him then.
Did you love him?
- I married him.
- But you didn't love him!
You make me sick.
I'd like to see you living like I did, sleeping
in a shed! And we ate once a day, that's all.
So, I went with the first one that said "I will
bring you to Rome." I married Rome, not him.
Well, how was it?
With an old man?
Don't make me think about it.
Come on, sit down.
He used to tell me about you, you know.
- What did he tell you?
- Everything.
- Really?
- Once when we were out fishing,
he told me how you were built. He bragged about it.
I felt like shoving him into the water!
He should have told you that for the
last two years I slept alone!
And with whom did you sleep?
Your mind's a sewer! When you're raising
a daughter, you think about other things!
Look... didn't you ever want to?
That's my affair.
What are you doing?
There's no business at this hour.
No one's likely to come in.
You can shut what you want, Giovanni.
You don't own me after all.
You like me a little bit, don't you?
- But think about your wife...
- My wife!
I hope a bomb falls on her,
then I can marry you.
No, don't, Giovanni.
Please, Giovanni.
Oh, Giovanni, be good!
Ah !
- Did you hurt yourself?
- I could murder you!
- Where did I hurt you?
- Here...
Here?
Giovanni !
Giovanni, you must never let
my daughter know about this
- Or else I'll do something crazy.
- Sorry about it already?
You better understand that for me Nothing
at all happened. We are like we were before.
Go on. I'll see you tomorrow.
You think you can treat me like that? Nobody can
treat me like that! I'm nobody's property!
Thanks a lot for the wine!
You'd better put a new lock
on the store right away.
- Don't worry. I said Gaetano.
- That's fine.
- If there's is anything new, I'll write you.
- I can't! I won't write you.
it takes me an hour to write one word!
- A postcard's all right...
- Maybe you could come see us some Sunday?
I already thought of that. Ciao !
Ciao.
Rosetta,
sit down.
Listen, Mamma, don't they sing well?
Dirty...
- Who are you angry at, Signora?
- Everyone.  - I just hate one person...
- What are they singing about?
- As always, something sad.
It makes you feel so melancholy!
You know who has the right to be melancholy?
We Italians!
My daughter was so excited about living
that she didn't sleep last night.
That pig!
- What is it? Where are we?
- Who knows?
- They bombed the rails ahead of us.
- Am I supposed to walk to Naples?
It will take for or five hours to repair it.
- Fuck!
- You should thank heaven the trains are running!
- I'm not thanking anybody, especially not heaven!
- That's your affair!
Look, that's Mount Forcella.
- Where's Sant'Eufemia ?
-  It's over there. We'll walk, we'll get there sooner.
-  Can we get off the train?
- Sure, why not?
- We'll have to walk many miles. All right?
I like to walk, Mamma.
- Will you hand me down our stuff?
- All right, get off, Signora.
Oh, the sack! Where is the sack?
[German accent] Signora, hold on !
- Thank you.
- Please.
When is this war going to end?
We'll get home for Christmas
Din-don ! Din-don !
Bells, Christmas and this all will be over.
And who understands you?
- He says it will be over by Christmas.
- Damn it! Another six months? It's much too long.
- Tell that to them!
- It all will be over at Christmas.
Din-don ! Din-don !
Here's how you do it, Rosetta. Look.
Watch out!
You have to feel it sitting on the middle
of your head, Rosetta. Don't keep your neck so stiff.
Easy, like this.
(CESIRA) I've lost the skill myself,
damn it!
Arrivederci !
- Arrivederci !
- Arrivederci !
- Those Germans aren't so bad after all.
- No, mamma.
What pretty creatures you are!
My sons' eyes are popping out of their heads.
Rosario, hurry up with that. When you're through
go to the house and get yourself some food
and for Luigino some slices of salami.
- What time can we leave tomorrow?
- Rosario, when do you think the pretty lady can leave?
- Whenever she wants. I've got the mule.
- I made you a good price.
- The room for the night was included.
- I didn't have any choice!
What? Why are you complaining? I didn't even
ask you for any money in advance.
- In this time, who knows? I don't know you, pretty lady.
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- You know what this is?
- Jesus, Joseph and Mary!
I never saw so much money before!
Rosario, the lady's a bank!
Here the Monkey arrive!
- What are you doing here, monkey?
- You know what we are doing here.
- Looking for bread? Some wine?
- You are trying to be clever. I am more clever
Where are your sons?
- In Albania ! They're fighting in the war. Every one
knows that. They're fighting for the King and Mussolini.
Of course. Look in there.
- Who's using this bicycle, Vincenzo ?
- My poor old husband doesn't have the strength anymore.
- I use it.
- Sure, why don't we have a race sometime?
- Who are they ? - People from Rome. They're spending the night
with me. They're on their way to Sant'Eufemia.
I gave them a bed. We're Christians...
You know that your sons are deserters.
And you know that if we catch them we have to shoot?
I say all deserters should be shot!
Here's the wine. Now, let's drink to my sons
Drink, monkey!
Give it to me.
What's new in Rome, Signora ?
- They are dropping bigger bombs every day!
- Wait a few more weeks, you'll see...
- We have decided to get it over with.
- Let's hope so.  - Stay here in Fondi, signora.
here you can eat. In Sant'Eufemia, they
won't even sell you flour.
- That's where I come from. They know me.
- We could put you up at headquarters.
- You and the girl could help us out.
- Especially in the kitchen.
What are you saying? I'm not servant.
Not just servant. To help the militia, it's an honor.
And you? You'd like it?
or would you rather go starve
with the goats?
- Keep that for your sister!
- Shut up. I'll tell you when to talk.
You tell who when to talk?
Keep your hands to yourself,
you miserable pig!
- Stay away from her, or I'll smash your face!
- They're respectable people. They're Fascists!
- This woman deserves to be shot.
- They're women, maybe you'd better leave them alone.
- Put that rock down.
- Do what he says! - Mamma !
We could force you to come to headquarters.
Make her understand.
I will talk her into it, Monkey.
Rosetta. Rosetta.
- Let's go. It will be light any minute.
- I'm sleepy ! - Damn it!
Those men will come back today.
I didn't sleep all night.
Rosetta.
Mamma.
Oh, mamma mia !
Put this on. Quick, quick, quick!
I shouldn't have showed them all my money,
they all look like dirty thieves!
With this, we can go where we want.
Please, hurry, sweet angel, hurry!
- You've never ridden a mule, have you?
- Never, mamma.
When I was young I loved to ride them.
I used to hit them to make them go faster.
Hey, where could we get two mules
to take us over to Sant'Eufemia ?
- I don't know. People doesn't move like before.
- I can pay.
- My daughter had enough walking.
- I'm from the next village, Forcella. I can't help you here.
- I bet you anything they're on her way to Rome again. Good bye.
- Good bye.
- You're not scared, are you?
- No, Mama, I'm not scared now.
That idiot tried to kill us!
- But why, Mama?
- Who knows!
Let's go. come on.
- We'd better go round this way... - The poor man...
- I know, but we couldn't help him, child.
- You are Paride.
- And you are Cesira.
- You still need a shave.
- We're not rich like you people in Rome.
This one made a fortune in Rome!
You recognize her?
Luisa !
- With a son on the way!
- He gave me three already!
- Sit down, signora.
- Sit down, Cesira. - Thank you.
- Signora, this is my niece.
- Hello.
We're celebrating a miserable day,
my wedding anniversary!
Come here, Rosetta, come here!
She's my daughter. This air brings back memories.
like when my mother used to say
[She speaks dialect]
- Do you understand me?
- I don't.  - It means that a person doesn't stand still.
It means: ''Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
I'm carrying my heart in a quagmire''.
- Where is my aunt?
- In Naples with her daughter.
- Armando ?
- He's dead.
That's where I was born. It's rented, Signora.
I'm waiting for my relatives from Formia.
- Could you put us up for a month?
- I have no room with all this people who are since spring.
I felt at first it was time to escape.
Paride, give them the weaving shed.
You can put the loom in your place.
- Paride, don't make me beg. Aren't we relatives?
- We're all relatives here.
- I'm not going back to Rome, nor to Fondi. This morning
we almost got ourselves killed.  - How?
- An airplane. It killed an old man.
- We're safe from that here.
- We pass the time among friends and we eat.
- The English will be here soon.
- English or German... who wins, wins.
- I'd wish they'd hurry! - Who doesn't?
If the Germans win, I will kill myself.
- What have they done to you anyway?
- To me personally, nothing.
- And then? - So, enough politics.
Eat some more. And you play!
- What would you like to hear? He used to have an orchestra in Fondi.
- Here he plays for nothing.
Play 'Vivere'' !
Living... without being jealous...
- Signora, you have a store? - And what a store!
- What kind? - A grocery.
Everything can change world, but not for someone
with a grocery store. Filippo De Libero, I have a store in Fondi.
- People will always need groceries.
- Unless the Russians come. - What do you mean?
The Russians don't believe in business.
Life without business is nothing.
- You accountants know anything!
- What does the Pope think, Signora?
He made a speech yesterday.
Everybody cried.
- Bombs killing women and children!
- Don't our bombs kill?
- You're the ones who wanted the war!
- Me ? - Yes, you, too.
- If I...
- You're wearing your Fascist pin.
- So what?
- I have one, too.  Does that mean I wanted the war? Play something!
- That won't change anything! The harm is done.
- You talk as if you weren't Italian.
I'm not, if it means stay here and stuffing my face
while the rest of the country is dying.
We're pigs. That's what we are!
All pigs!
Why do you always have to spoil everything, Michele?
- He's not a bad boy, signora.
- No, Signora, he's really very nice.
My son should thank God that I'm around to earn money!
- He's an idealist.
- That's it! - So everybody makes a fool of you.
Let's play ''Faccetta Nera'' [A Fascist song].
Maybe I could buy some food for you.
Once there was enough of everything here.
Money was all you needed.
Not now.
You can buy me fifty sacks of flour...
twenty sacks of corn meal...
You want some split peas, beans, lentils?
- How are the prices?
- People around here are still honest.
A jar of lard and some olive oil.
- Who's got olive oil these days?
- I'll get her some, Mama.
Don't worry about them, Signora.
They come almost every night.
- Why didn't they wash before dinner?
- Ladies don't work on the land.
when I was young we were worse off than you are!
- Your land was poor. You sowed the field with wheat
and the priests took all the harvest. - You hear Rosetta?
Papa.
In a little sack there are 60 nuts.
Ten persons want an equal share.
Do I multiply or divide?
Why ask your father? You went to school,
you have to teach us.
Do you see this piece of bread?
If I want to give one piece to you and one piece
to me, what do I do?
- Stupid!
- Leave him alone! The school is closed, it is not his fault.
- Your uncle will teach you when he comes back.
- He can wait. Go to your mother.
- He'll never come back.
- Where is he?  - In Russia.
- Those Russian women, they only like foreign men.
- There are no men in Russia?
Peppino will come back!
- He wants to be near his little girl
- He left her before she was born.
- You want some of these carots?
- We fed these to horses.  - War changes things.
Antonio, they're dropping the big lights!
The big lights! Look! There they are!
You see the big lights?
- How lovely, Mama, makes me feel like praying
- Then pray, my angel, pray.
I beg your pardon, I didn't want to offend you.
It would take more than that.
What are they doing with those lights?
- They are checking troop movements.
- Can they see us?  - Very clearly.
Isn't there some safe place in the world?
You can't escape. And it is better so.
You see everything so black!
What's on your conscience?
- Sins, like everybody?
- There are no sins on my conscience.
Well, you might count one... the day before yesterday.
- you see?
- It was not a sin for which I should die.
And where do the children come into it?
You're getting a real behind like a woman!
Signora !
Michele !
- Signora, I wanted to... I didn't know, I'm sorry.
- Dont' worry, she's only a little girl.
- I'm inviting you both for a walk.
- Dry yourself, dear.
- Ask the girl to excuse me.
- Forget about it, will you? Come back later.
No, mamma !
- Don't make such a face.
- I never want to see him again.
He couldn't have seen you.
The sun was in his eyes.
The boy's a bit mad. His father spent a fortune
to educate him and all he gets are insults.
- The things he said were true.
- What do you know about life?
If you talked to me the way he does
I would slap your face.
You should have seen him run!
We must be nice to him.
His father has hams, pasta, everything!
I'm first, 'm first, I won!
- You're a real mountain goat! What's that book?
- History, I failed it.
- What school do you go to?
- The convent.
- In convents, you never learn
how things really are.   - Why?
Michele says it's wrong to send me to the convent.
There's such a thing as public school,
isn't there?
She goes to the best school in Rome.
It costs a fortune.
That's right, in Italy, the more money you have
the more you go with the priests and the nuns.
- Rosetta ! - Rosetta !
- Ah, you and your smart ideas!
I'm sorry but sometimes I have
to say what I think.
- Do you ever go to church?
- Me?    - Yes.
A few years ago, I wanted to become a priest.
- You wanted to become a priest?
- Yes, I did.
- Why didn't you go ahead and do it?
- I realized I didn't have the vocation.
Or rather that I did, which is why
I didn't become a priest.
- Rosetta !
- I don't want to come!
- Come on!
- You mustn't say things like that to her.
Rosetta's a saint.  I'm not
even worthy to be her mother.
- No, you're something better than you think.
- What am I?
A shopkeeper.
But in spite of that, you're a good person.
- What's wrong with selling things?
- You're the same as before.  - What?
- a peasant.
- Thank you for the compliment.
- It is one, nowadays.
- What do you mean?
The uncivilized people are in the cities today.
They are the evil ones.
But peasants could begin again after the war.
What does that mean?
They are the ones who could build
something new,
but that won't happen while the others
control the government.
I'm sure you're wrong, you'll never
change the peasants or cheat them.
I made a little money because
I am like them,
I never trust anybody.
A four-leaf clover!
It will bring you luck, here.
Damn it!
Damn it, I would give anything
to be in Rome right now!
Don't you even smoke?
No.
- You have a girl?
- No.
- What's the matter? Didn't you ever have one?
- No.
Today if a man can't sacrifice a little,
he's of no use to himself, his family or country.
Right, you can do without a lot of things
but not love.
- Ehi, little one, come here!
- Oh, what do they want?
- What do you want?
- Glad to see you again.
- I was asking were the shortcut to Sella is.
- Down there, straight ahead.
It's Filippo's son, the professor.
You remember, he's of the good ones.
In that case, he'll be glad to hear what happened.
Tell him.
I'd like to see his face when he hears it.
Tell him.
- We'd better go.
- Tell him, tell him!
- They have put the Duce in prison.
- What are you talking about?
They put Mussolini in jail, like a thief,
the one who made the Empire.
And what will happen to Italy now?
Twenty years of glory ruined in a day, in an hour!
He was a fool, the Duce, for not
getting rid of you traitors at the start.
You don't need reason with traitors,
You use this!
Put that away, will you?
Let him alone, the Germans will get him. Let's go.
If it's really true, I will day happy.
Go ahead!
- No !
- Be quiet, Rose, he will not fire.
The Germans will show you
how they handle traitors!
They will make you lick dirt
with your tongue! Go on, eat dirt!
Let's go Secretary. And you thank God
we are kindhearted.  Secretary...
They are going, my daughter, look, you see.
Did you believe him Michele? It's like a comedy.
- It's true, they're running away.
- It's impossible! It can't be true.
But it's true. A new life is beginning.
- We can go back to Rome.
- Go wherever you like, we're free!
I'm going back, I'm going to tell everybody!
You know something?
It's all crazy as hell.
Excuse me, Rosetta.
We'll, I'm glad that they've liberated Mussolini,
poor man. He has a wife and children, too.
Just between us, Mussolini, as a man, I mean...
what do you think of him?
- As a man ?
- He would scare me.
How can you make love with that man?
I'd freeze up.
all you have to do is switch off the light.
- What are you laughing at?
- Go and read your book.
- I want to know.
- We were talking politics.
- Signora, tell us what's so funny. - Aren't we playing cards?
One moment. Open up, there.
- I win!
- That's right.
Come in.
These two are English.
They need assistance.
Their submarine brought them
to Italy on a mission.
- This is no business of yours
- We could hide them for a few days, before they go to South.
- But the other people can protest.
- They don't protest, they shoot!
- Well?
You must explain to them
we have a duty toward our families.
There are many spies. If the Germans
found out, what a mess!
They'd take us all to Germany, Michele.
- Yes, we must think about our children.
- You don't have any.
- You can't always think about yourself.
- You're wearing your Fascist pin.
- This way.
- Michele.
- We could give them some bread.
- Isn't she stupid?
She wakes up hungry during the night,
yet she wants to give away food. Come on.
- They go right after, eh?
- I knew you were a decent person.
- Damn it, anyway.
- You should put something on it right away.
I'm used to it from slicing in the shop.
Thank you. This wine should be good,
because it was given by someone good.
To the English.
To the other English.
To Michele.
A drop for Rosetta, and to me.
- To victory.
- To a new world.
Many of us hope that after the war
there'll be a great change.
It will change, but first I'm afraid
we'll have to beat the Germans.
It's very good.
- Viva Giovanni!
- Giovanni!
- Who's Giovanni ?
- A little more, mamma.
You want to get drunk?
My ears are hot already.
- There are lots of good things in Italy.
- You don't know Italy.
- Oh, we know Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo.
- They are dead.
You don't know the ones who are alive.
Look at those eyes.
Show the English your eyes, sweet angel.
They're like two stars.
- They're pretty.
- Beautiful.
Instead of landing your armies so far south
you should have landed much further up,
you would have bombed fewer cities.
And fewer children like this one
would have been killed.
Headquarters ordered it,
it had to have a reason.
Headquarters give orders,
but they haven't seen these eyes.
Why don't you ask him if the war
will be finished by spring?
They know less than we do.
well, thank you very much. We don't want
to abuse your hospitality.
Where are they going to sleep?
I've gone this far.
In the mountains, signora.
We're strong enough now.
There are caves up above
here in the mountains.
- Thank you.
- That's all right.
- Thank you, signora.
- Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci.
- Wait, I'll go see if it's all right.
Come on!
Put the things away. I'm going out
for a breath of air. Feel my forehead.
How warm you are, mamma !
- You just keep going straight ahead.
- Good bye. Thank you.
When I have a drink, it goes right to my head.
- Who is Giovanni ?  - Are you still asking me that?
Why do you want to know?
- No reason.
- He is a friend, one that I can trust.
- Do you love this Giovanni?
- Do you love...?
Why? Can't I love if I want?
A widow, she can't be loved?
He has a wife and two kids, anyway.
Does it seem right to you that a person
has to stick to someone he doesn't love?
It's terrible to go to bed with someone
you don't like. every night, all your life...
Come on Rose, come on.
This horseman is a donkey.
- Good night Michele
- Good night
- At least, Michele !
- The mice don't  respect anything.
- They have gnawed off even the Bible.
- Put yourself in the middle.
We are not at church,
you wanted to read us a story.
MicheIe, read whatever you want.
Here you have beautiful stories,
even better than in the novels.
I read of when Jesus walks on the sea.
Better, the Lazarus' resurrection.
Mama, come here, don't stand up.
No, I have to prepare the grass for dinner.
- Who's that?
- He's the son of refugees just arrived. His mother is ill.
Now we have become like goats, eating grass.
- Please, read.
- Who has the flour, does not sell it. - Please, read.
The farmers buried it.
Impossibile to find the salt.
- We ought to help each others
- We are all Italians.  - Please read, MicheIe.
''A man named Lazarus
- at Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister were living...''
- Why have not you call me before?!
''Mary is that person who anointed the Lord's feet with perfume
and wiped them with her hair.
- It was her brother Lazarus that was ill.
- Amen.
'So the sisters sent him this message:
Please, Master, you dear friend is ill.
Jesus said: 'This illness will not result in death.
No, it is to promote the glory of God.
Through it, the Son of God is to be glorified..
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus...''
- Can you give me some bread?
- Be quiet.
''..he tarried, it is true, for two days in the place where he was.''
- AchiIIe! Did you buy some oil?
- No, they it was too expensive.
Stupid, it will become even more expensive.
You ought to buy!
A postcard for Serafino
and one mail for Cesira.
- Did you listened at radio?
- They failed to land because of a woman.
- But now they'll carry out the offensive.
- This time it's true.
- Signora Cesira, here we are!
- The Battista's son came back.
- We're going to talk later.
- See you...
MicheIe, let's go on.
''he remained for two days in the place where he was.
Then after this he said to his disciples:
"Let us go back to Judea."
The disciples said to him: "Rabbi, the Jews were just
trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?
Jesus answered,
"Are there not twelve hours in a day?
If one walks during the day, he does not stumble
because he sees the light of this world.
But if one walks at night...''
They tried to steal at home,
but Giovanni cheated them!
He's better than a brother!
They could to ruin me. The Rosetta's dowry
was in the wardrobe.
You are all dead,
more dead than Lazarus.
With your flour, with your thieves' scare,
your wealth walled up
not even Jesus Christ
could resuscitate you!
MicheIe !
- What's wrong?
- Nothing
Mama, was listening to him!
MicheIe's right.
Please stop! What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- You called us dead!
- We'll die by starvation for sure!
- Me too I'm dead.  - You, so young?
You have always to say what is in your heart,
right or wrong...
- I have not the nerve to talk aloud.
- You're even too much sincere.
- I am not sincere with you.
- With me?
Sure, with you.
Shoo! Even the goats!
I'll have to clean up everything here.
The gate is broken since I went away.
Let's go, it's raining.
I love you, Cesira.
- In such a trouble, do you mind to that?
- I have to tell you.
You could too give me a smack in the face,
but it's true.
These stupids are here to see the scene!
- Don't you mind to such a things?
- Me?
You mind, you mind. You have someone in your heart.
Only my daughter.
- I've decided to go back home, Rosetta.
- Se vuoi, mamma.
- They won't bomb Rome anymore. They'll start bombing here.
- True, mamma.
How skinny you got. You need more to eat.
We have plenty to eat, in Rome.
How cold she is!
Come here, Rosetta.
- Mama, why doesn't he come anymore, Michele?
- I don't know.
- He loves you, Michele.
- Go on.
I can see why, you're so beautiful.
He's 25 years old! Never go with a boy
younger than yourself.
- But he's the nicest man in Sant'Eufemia.
- Being a nice man these days isn't much help.
Damn draft!
- You know what I think Michele is? A subversive.
- What's that?
Someone with a good heart
who doesn't like work.
- We'd better give him back his book.
- But he gave it to me.  - He'd make a good husband.
He has no vices. If you were a few years older,
I'd let you marry him.
- What are you saying, mamma!
- You'll have to think about such things someday, no?
Listen to her laugh!
- Hide it, hide it. It's fresh bread.
- Oh, thank you.
Be careful, hide it,
I don't want my father to know.
- Please, give me some bread.
- You, be quiet!
- I want some! I want some!
- Quiet!
EvangeIisti ! EvangeIisti !
- EvangeIisti, will you sell me some cheese?
- My name isn't Evangelisti, it's De Santis.
- They told me you are EvangeIisti and sell cheese?
- We are of the Evangelist religion.
What does that mean?
- Nothing, only we live by the Gospel.
- What about the cheese, do you sell it?
Well, no, but I can give you some,
- What's wrong with that sheep?
- That sheep is going to be a mother any minute now.
- Such a small one!
- You want two?
- How much for one?
- 1,000 lires each one.  - Is it gold?
Better, it's hard to eat gold,
but cheese you can eat.
- Does the Gospel teach you to ask such prices?
- If you don't want it...
Before, I could have bought a house with this.
Don't take it, Signora. If you take it at my price,
you'll be mad at me,
and if I sell it at your price
I'll be mad at you.
Gospel wants men love each other.
- You're worse than all them.
- Peace, little sister.
- If you want a lamb for Easter, let me know.
- No, you won't cheat me anymore.
Good.
It's good.
Good.
- Where could I find flour?
- Who has flour.
If Rosetta gets sick, I'll get a knife
then you'll see flour!
One of these days we'll go see the peasants
with guns! Then we refugees will get flour.
- That's the way!
- If you ever do that, I will kill you!
- Who's taking to you?
- He doesn't understand, he doesn't have children.
- What are you teaching the children?
- You want to teach me?
- Go back to your mother!
- You try it and see if I don't do what I say!
- I thought you'd left.
- I'm leaving soon. - Where? - Down.
- We haven't seen you lately.
- I'll walk with you to Fondi.
- Are you crazy? The Germans will shoot you.
- There's a friend there who might sell us food.
- You mustn't risk it.
- Something could happen to you.
You don't know me very well.
If a German gets too close...
What's the world coming to?
Horses eating grain!
Via !
- They were eating grain.
- Please do not be afraid. I'm not German.
- You're Russian.
- Russian, traitor.
You seem like Ukrainian girl.
Ukrainian eyes, beautiful.
- Is the road safe?
- You can go.
Last days for Germans.
For me too, I think.
- He's beautiful! Is he really a Russian?
- A deserter.
They never tell you that they make them
like that in Russia!
Can you tell me where I can buy some
sugar, flour...
Some tinned food, some honey, little sugar?
You know, anything you can get.
If I tell you, you won't tell the Germans
where I've hidden my food?
I swear I won't tell anyone.
The last time, do you know what I said?
"I have nothing." And they said: "Oh, you have nothing?".
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta...
You can have this milk, if you like.
I don't need it anymore. What for?
They killed Gaetanino, my baby.
Who will I give it to?
You want it?
Who wants milk?
Who wants my milk?
Hurry up, hurry up!
- MicheIe, where did you come from?
- Sant'Eufemia, everyone's all right.
- This is a friend of ours, a refugee.
- Please, Signora, come in.
This way.
These are old friends. This is the commander of the
German anti-aircraft station..
MicheIe !
- Cesira, a friend of the family.
- Sit down. - Help yourselves.
May I ask you how it is that you
managed to procure this loaf of bread?
A soldier made us a present of it and we gave
him a present. You know, it's wartime...
- An exchange, in other words.
- That's right.
That's forbidden. Who was the soldier?
- I will go and make the coffee.
- I'll give you a hand.
- Sit down.
- I'll help you, I'll help you.
MicheIe, eat some cake.
- Your occupation?
- I'm a graduate.
- And what did you study?
- Literature.
I studied philosophy at the university of Rome.
Then you can understand how we Italians can take
whatever happens to us philosophically.
No, I don't. In Italy there are many things I find
confusing, especially the great class distinctions.
People like you who have everything
and your peasants have nothing.
This is not our usual daily meal.
My mother... cooked it in your honor.
Yesterday I went to look at some of your peasants...
Like swine, dear sir, they all live like swine.
You don't understand,
they live that way because they want to!
You! You are the leaders of Italy!
It's  your fault!
And please, you won't hush me with one dinner!
I speak the truth.
Mamma mia !
We have to stay on the right side of him.
He eats here every Saturday afternoon.
I'd poison his soup!
- We Germans are devoted to the truth!
- Do you think you're the only ones, because you're not.
I think you Germans will be surprised when you
find out the truth is not only your property.
- He always drinks more than one bottle, always.
- Excuse me. - Eat whatever you want.
- May I take some leftovers?
- Take what you want.
- Now what? - He always make him sing.
- Could I have some sugar?
And some flour?
You... and MicheIe...
The coffee!
- Grind it for me.
- Sure.
- You Germans have war in their blood.
- War?
War, my dear friend, is an experience without wich
a man cannot say he is a man.
If that's true, I would rather be castrated.
That is the way all you Italians feel,
and so we are forced to waste valuable men here.
It is not true, you were beaten
before you started.
Ach, instead of dreaming, put in your heads,
You and all the rest of you italians,
you will have to pay the pice of your faults!
Pay!Pay! You understand? and your children
will have to pay with bitter tears!
- What have the children got to do with it?
- Tell me.
- We met a woman driven crazy by you, but you won't drive me crazy!
- Don't listen to her! She's only a woman.
- Oh, let's get out, let's get out!
- Hurry, Mama!
- God help us all!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Oh, help me!
- Okay Mama, just hurry.
Cesira, come!
I can't see! i can't see!
What are you doing?
If Rosetta had seen us, we'd
have made a pretty picture.
You know what? I think you're old enough
to have a new hairdo.
- I'd like you to do my hair like yours, Mama.
- I'll try.
You're two inches taller since we are here.
I'm going into the mountains. Good-bye.
- And how you'll arrive there?
- I'll be all right.
- Take care. What are you going to do?
- Something good.
- So long, Rosetta.
- Will we see you, in Rome?
Maybe
I'll send you some books anyway.
- You have our address?
- I'll be able to find you two, don't worry.
Hey, come and see! There are Germans in the haystack!
They're retreating!
In a few days we'll leave!
You will give us something to eat.
- I said you will give us something to eat!
- Here nobody has anything. We are hungry ourselves.
I gave an order.
We better do something.
Get him some bread, go on.
We need one of you to come with us
to show us the quickest way.
We have to get down to the next valley.
- You - I'm not from here. I don't know these hills
- He doesn't know.
You then.
Anyone here can tell you that we are from
Ceprano. We are just refugees.
We need water.
- Water, hurry up!
- Somebody get some water!
Hurry up!
Come on, run!
You will hand me that bread!
We are the mad dogs!
- You come with us.
- He's my son!
My son doesn't know these mounutains.
He reads, he is a student! He studies the Bible!
Move or I'll fire.
Pick me. Pick me!
I know these hills.
I'll show you the fastest way over.
I'll go, Mama. I'll go.
Come on, let's go! There's a long way to go.
You are an old man, I want the young one.
It's a duty.
Don't worry about me, I'll be back
before tonight.
Bye, Mama.
I'll be back.
My son ! MicheIino !
He'll come back, dont' worry.
Forward.
- The Americans are coming! Look the Americans! - Michele understood
the situation so he cut back through the valley. He's waiting in Fondi.
- I'm sure.
- But Michele was supposed to come back here.
MicheIe knew what would happen. When the American army
broke through, he knew we would all leave.
And he would be right, everybody is leaving.
- Come on, FiIippo.
- I'll put your things on a mule.
- Let's go together and see what happened to Michele.
- Signora, in a few days you'll be in Rome.
- Paride, come here! Luisa wants you!
- I'll be right back.
- Stay here with your wife, we'll be all right.
- it always takes her all day to have a baby.
Some are born, and some die.
MicheIe has a head on his shoulders.
He won't be fooled by those Germans!
Come on, let's go.
Everything is over! Everything is over!
I still don't know wether
the shelling is American or German.
The Germans are on the run. If the Allies
keep this up, soon they chase them up to Milan.
- Can we go back to Rome? - A matter of hours.
- It'll take longer than that.
- Don't they have to liberate us?
Look! The Americans!
Ehi, signorina ! Signorina !
- Signora Cesira.
- What does he want?
- He asked you to show your legs.
Because he wants to take your picture.  - Ask your sister!
I'm sorry, she won't.
We can't get to Fondi.
They're all bombing all along the road.
We have to wait until the
Americans have gone through.
- We are from the next village, just a short way
down the road.   - God be with you.
may the Virgin protect you.
- Mama, what can we do?  - FiIippo,  I want to know
about my boy. Let's go  - Yes, you're right.
Paride, I think we have got to go to Fondi.
Michele might be waiting.
- Mama, come on!
- My angel, it's a mess!
- This is no time to go to Fondi. I'm going back to Sant'Eufemia.
- Not for me, no!
- We left too soon.
- Let's go.
- Good bye.
- Good luck.
Wait, be careful, Maria.
Take my arm.
- Let me know about Michele!  - They're all out of their minds.
They'll be right in the middle of the bombing!
- Good-bye, signora.
- Good-bye.
- Bye Rosetta.
- Good-bye.
- Signora, come with us.
- No no, good-bye.
Come sweet angel, come on. Weìll get to Rome
over the mountains, it's safer.
Come on, let's go!
Look at the crazy girl!
What's MicheIe to you? Father, brother, what?
Come one or I'll smack you!
Are you coming or not? Rose!
Hurry up, Rosetta !
I want to go back to Rome, understand?
Run!
Damn you!
Let's go.
You won't  get back to Rome?
Want to eat something?
Yes-
Here.
- I wonder who they are.
- They're Allies, Mama.
Come, let's find some shade.
Oh, my legs!
- Feel like taking a little nap?
- Yes.
All right, lay down.
- Want this off?
- No no.
Rosetta.
- Rosetta. - What?
- Did you see? We'd better out of here!
Rosetta !
Run Rosetta, run !
Rosetta !
Mama !
Rosetta !
Mamma !
Rosetta.
Sweet angel.
- Do you think you can walk?
- Yes.
Rosetta.
Rosetta.
Do you know what they have done
those "heroes" that you command?
Do you know what your great soldiers have done
in a holy church under the eyes of the madonna?  Do you know?
Peace, peace.
Yes, peace, beautful peace! You ruined
my little daughter forever!
Now she's worse than dead.
No, I'm not mad, I'm not mad!
Look at her!
And tell me if I am mad!
Rotten crazy bastards!
Rosetta.
Rosetta !
Rosetta !
Rosetta.
Wait, let me help you.
- Are you in pain, my daughter?
- No.
- Baby, please speak to me.
- What is there to say?
You seem angry with me, sweet angel.
You must be strong.
Tomorrow we'll be in our house,
I'm sure of it.
We'll find a place to sleep
and leave tomorrow.
- What's the use?
- What's the use? You'll drive me mad.
- We've been through terrible things together. This will pass.
- Mama, don't talk about it anymore.
Come on, sweet angel. We left our things
up on the road. Someone might steal them.
Come.
Come my angel come.
Why don't you lean on me?
Come on Rose.
- You had nothing to do with those Moroccans?
- I told you no.
At Vallecorsa this morning
they raped half the village.
If they touched my sister I would killed them all.
- Where will you drop us?
- After Fondi.
- If you want to stop at any place my mother has an extra bed.
- We are on our way to Rome.
It's too dangerous. Wait a few days,
let the Americans go first.
You like to dance?
To dance!
Well, then, what about the girl?
- You... you like to dance?
- Leave her alone, she's not even 13!
What's the difference? My regular girl's only 15.
Girls grow up quick around here.
- Tonight we're going to throw a little victory party.
- Tonight we have to get some sleep.
Who wants to sleep?
I want to enjoy myself.
Don't you like to sing, kid?
- Yes.
- Then come on, let's sing!
That's it, beautiful, sing!
Rosetta ?
Rosetta !
The dress!
Rosetta.
Rosetta !
- What's the matter, Signora?
- Signora, what is it?
She might have gone to Fondi
to look for MicheIe.
Out all alone like this at night!
She must have gone to Fondi !
- How far? How far is it from here to Fondi?
- I'll take you there, signora. It will only take us half an hour.
But why, why didn't she tell me?
- All right let's go to Fondi, to FiIippo's grocery, Michele's father.
- I'll just go get my shoes on.
They killed FiIippo's son.
They found him up in the hills tonight.
Michele.
Sure it was Michele ?
That's right. A friend of mine saw
the Germans shoot him.
His mother is dying of sorrow!
Signora, your daughter she's out
with my son, my FIorindo.
- Where? - Not far, they went dancing.
- Where are they? - Not far, I told you!
What kind of a pig is your son? She's only a little girl,
I'm going to kill your rotten son!
If she went out with him, she wanted too.
No one forced her.
What's happened to her, God.
What have I done wrong?
Tell me what have I done wrong...
She'll come back..
Go to bed.
- Why didn't you tell me what you were going to do?
- You were asleep.
- You two arranged this before.. last night
- Yes.
- Who gave you these?
- FIorindo.
- And what for?
- To wear.
- To wear?
- Sure.
Don't you ever say 'sure' to me like that!
Do you hear? You will not put those
stockings on! You will not put them on!
You will not! Now I'm going
to smack his face, that dirty pig!
She doesn't even cry...
Too stupid.
He was right, MicheIe.
Escape, escape...
But you can escape from this...
You havent' even asked about MicheIe.
He's dead. Michele!
Mamma.
Angel...
Sweet angel.
Forgive me.
Please forgive me.
Stop it, Rosetta, please.
Come here, Rose.
Come, sweet angel.
Please stop crying, please.
Please Rosetta, please...
Please, Rosetta.
My sweet angel.
Sleep.
My angel, my angel.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
