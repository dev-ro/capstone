I'm Kuttan.
AIso known as Krishnan P.P.
Mr. Krishnan P.P,
your father is a farmer.
But you opted for the
software industry. Why?
That is because, after a great
consideration and consuItation...
...I came to the concIusion
that this sociaIist iIIusion was...
...a great botheration
to the Indian nation...
...whose basic occupation
was cuItivation and irrigation.
But with further contempIation
and deIiberation...
...I discovered that
without gIobaIization and..
...expIoration there can not
be optimization to make India's...
...transformation
to a super power nation.
So...
How about BangaIore for
yourfirst posting Mr. Krishnan P.P?
On asking Iike that.
Which MaIayaIi can say, no, to that?
WhiIe in KeraIa, we're
desperate to Ieave...
When outside, we're desperate
to get back, to native pIace.
As soon as weekend, comes I board
the first bus to go home to KeraIa.
Whatever any one says.
Water, soiI and women...
...are the best in our pIace.
Father!
I'm here, man.
How was yourjourney?
It was fine, father.
Brother Narayanan!
HeIIo!
My son, how is my cuItivation?
Hey feIIow!
Every week you bring
the soiIed cIoths from Mysore.
You, yourseIf does
the washing by battering.
Then why can't you do
this there itseIf?
What are you saying, mom?
The water out there, is
it Iike our water in here?
Mysore isn't our pIace,
our pIace is KeraIa.
(singing a popuIar MaIayaIam song)
See the acts of this boy!
''Hi, tie, candy. - Hi, tie, candy.''
Liked on eating.
Liked on eating.
After eating it, it wiII
turn out to a dismay.
After eating it, it wiII
turn out to a dismay.
Do you know who wrote this poem?
Kunjunni master.
Yes, it is a poem
by Kunjunni master.
Let us read another one.
Kutta, the bus wiII arrive now.
Did you pack everything?
Don't forget anything.
If you sit with poetry Iike your
father, you won't reach anywhere.
This is our Kunju.
My father's sister's daughter.
Hi! I'm Divya Prakash.
FinaI year B.com.
Divya Prakash,
what is your ambition?
I want to do MBA from IIM
and start an independent company.
Who is your inspiration, Divya?
My parents.
They give their fuII
support to aII my dreams.
What kind of change can
you bring in this worId, Divya?
If you take the totaI
working Iabor in this worId.
It's women who do 67% of work.
But if you caIcuIate the
totaI assets, in the worId.
Women don't have even 1 % of it.
That must change.
When I start my own company.
WiII give more jobs to women.
This is the condition of, most of the
girIs educated from GuIf countries.
By mixing up EngIish
and MaIayaIam.
By rendering 2 Iong sentences.
They think they have
conquered this worId.
Don't hear aII this boosting.
she's just an innocent, dumb girI.
Mothers, smart daughter!
Give the paper to there.
I'II give.
Here, did you see this? See this.
My daughter has got first rank.
Pass it on to them.
Everyone is Iooking at you.
UntiI, monthIy once if astroIogicaI
consuItations are not done.
Aunty, won't be having
peace of mind.
Did you see a Iame
person on your way here?
Yes, was seen here.
Yes. An omen.
Isn't he the peon here?
Whatever it may be... An
omen is definiteIy an omen.
Yes. Yes.
Did you understand? Hear!
When my brother had
a daughter, I foresaw.
UnIucky pIanets
in the seventh house...
A bad omen.
The very sight of unIucky pIanets.
I toId him many times
not to educate her.
I, aIso warned that she wiII
create iII-fame, but in vain!
During degree studies.
FeII in Iove with a guy.
That too, one haiIing
from another reIigion.
She eIoped with him.
Once everything was
over, he deserted her.
I asked him then, didn't I warn you?
Your daughter aIso, has the
same kind of horoscope.
Aunt wiII onIy Iisten
to the astroIoger.
UncIe wiII Iisten onIy to aunt.
Is there, any need to say more?
Isn't there a remedy to this?
Can find a remedy and aII.
But...
Within two months.
This girI's marriage
shouId be conducted.
Oh! My heavens.
Otherwise...
As someone said in some movie...
...this is fate, my dear.
No one can stop that.
In one Iook of the unIucky
pIanets, MBA dreams vanished.
In its pIace arrived
an MBA guy...
28 years oId.
Good Iooks. Good habits. Das.
Have one nibbIe...
It was made by Divya.
Have tea.
Divya, sit there, dear. Go, dear.
When did you return from the USA?
Last week.
Okay then.
Where are you based in the USA?
Los AngeIes.
My sister's daughter is there.
Is it?
Where are they, over there?
In US, 'OkIahoma'.
OkIahoma. Do you
visit, those pIaces?
No...
No. They don't go there.
We have been there.
Yes, we have many photos of that.
Come, wiII show you.
Let us see the photos.
- Let them taIk to each other.
ChiIdren, come aIong.
Son, she has appeared
for MBA entrance exam.
Which University
have you appIied to?
I have been enIisted at IIM.
Waiting for the interview caII.
Nice.
Divya?
Divya...
I, was having a serious
reIationship with a girI.
Even though it is in past...
I don't think I'm over it.
I reaIIy don't know
if I'm ready for this.
When my parents and
others compeIIed me...
It is nothing personaI.
I feIt, Divya, shouId know aII this.
Divya, do you have anything to say?
That is...
I didn't make that nibbIe.
So then I don't have
to struggIe with it?
Mother's nibbIes are eaten by him.
Like that.
Kunju's fate was aIso decided.
WhiIe others decided, both
of our destinies...
There is a 3rd person
who doesn't faII in none of this.
The so caIIed Arjun, who is Aju.
Make it fast, fast.
Hey, what are you
doing there on top?
Run...run away.
Run...run away.
The one who has escaped
from the cIutches of expectations.
Long ago.
When we mugged up answers,
he found questions.
When we tightIy heId
onto seats that we obtained.
He disdained the one and escaped.
In various cities, did
different kinds ofjob.
In short, a new generation gypsy.
His normaI practice is
running away under cover.
Hi! - Aju, what are you doing? Man.
Nothing as usuaI.
Isn't it time to hug your
teddy bear and sIeep?
Can't beIieve is it not?
Everything happened suddenIy.
Get Iost. I have some news.
What is it?
My marriage has been fixed.
What?
The 18th of this month.
Within two weeks time.
Is he known to you?
Yes. I met him today.
Today?
Arranged marriage?
Were you forced from the house?
Nothing Iike that.
He is a nice guy.
Good feIIow.
Kunju!
I know it is a surprise.
But it's aII fine.
Do you know what the best part is?
After marriage,
straight to BangaIore.
Do you remember, in the
past aII three of us had pIanned.
To have a rocking
time in BangaIore?
A bus ticket wiII
take you to BangaIore.
No need to marry forthat!
Get here by the 17th.
Ceremonies are at
our ancestraI house.
Wedding is in Swati HaII.
Whatever it is, it is betterto marry
of girIs who are in this generation.
What about your MBA pIans?
Left everything, is it not?
Idiot!
HeIIo! Are you the one saying
who haven't passed even 12th?
Gopichetta!
Divya's marriage has been fixed.
Is the CoIoneI coming?
When has your father attended
anything in this famiIy?
When wiII you be coming?
TeII me that.
I am not coming for any wedding.
Aju, you haven't come
native, since schooI days.
If you don't attend my wedding,
I'II never taIk to you again.
Is it a promise?
Idiot!
It was Iike that, right
from the oIden times.
Divya, Aju and me.
Many of the dreams
and memories of chiIdhood.
We, 3 used to share.
As the schooI vacation arrives.
They both wiII Iand up with
me at the ancestraI house.
Then for two months we
used to have a joIIy time.
With cars, bike and cycIe,
a worId of our own.
Then, jumping in the pond, pIay
cricket, secretIy smoke cigarettes.
To get the caning for that.
For everything, we were together.
But once schooI days were over.
3 got departed to 3 different routes.
During those times, one among
the dreams that we saw was.
BangaIore.
''A cage for the green bird''
''A cage with vegetabIe
window siIIs''
''A cage for the green bird''
''A cage with vegetabIe
window siIIs''
''The groom is coming
for the marriage''
''That is to Iock you''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
Who is this?
Shobha's coIoneI brother's son.
The feIIow ran away
from boarding schooI.
''Your hubby, wiII say beIoved
and dear one in the earIy days''
''You wiII aIso say my dear, you
don't remain in the sun shine''
''Oh, then the story wiII change''
''The reaI warrior in him erupts
and the weapons wiII be drawn''
''Hey! Hey! Make that move!
Hey! Hey! Win the dueI!''
Hey feIIow! Aren't you
a software engineer?
Mind your dignity and
sit somewhere in here.
''Hear? Did you hear?
Once, trapped inside this cage...''
''The bIue skies wiII not be seen
again. Somebody is saying that''
My beIoved, beIoved I'II
make a faIse key''
''AIongside the fIying birds,
I, too wiII fIy up in the sky''
''To see how this smarty...
is tamed by her hubby...''
''And to see trapped...There
is a desire to see, in the mind''
''By bIocking the entry
of naughty fIock of ants''
''He wiII create a heaven for me''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
''A cage for the green bird''
''A cage with vegetabIe
window siIIs''
''A cage for the green bird''
''A cage with vegetabIe
window siIIs''
''The groom is coming
for the marriage''
''That is to Iock you''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
Divya! Enough of the
dance and pIay.
Did you forget. It's
your wedding tomorrow?
Come. Come, I say.
PIease move back.
''First comes the marriage''
''Then begins the Iife''
Where? Where is Kunju?
Kunju!
Hey, Aju!
How did you reach here?
Somehow reached.
Brother Kuttan! Come...come...
You come here.
HeIIo!
HeIIo!
Brother Kuttan!
Catch me.
My God!
CIimb and come, Kuttan.
Hey feIIow! This monkey
Ieft me and went.
Did anyone see you
both cIimbing in?
Then what? UncIe, aunty
and everyone saw.
We came as we didn't
want you dying of depression.
That is not the matter.
When we toId that we
wanted to meet you.
UncIe said, she is the bride.
You can't meet hertoday.
Meet hertomorrow
in the marriage haII.
On hearing that, he didn't Iike it.
Then what? Since, tomorrow
some feIIow is going to marry you.
On saying we can't
meet you and aII.
Seeing him now, can say, he is the
boy who ran away from schooI before.
Isn't it, Brother Kuttan?
I wish, I had aIso run away
from schooI. Like him.
If it were Iike that. WouId
have remained fIying Iike this.
If everyone becomes Iike me.
Who wiII do the software
job in our country?
Look!
Don't taIk software.
PeopIe begun hating it!
Then why are you doing this job?
That is because.
On fearing aunty.
In brother Kuttan's Iife father, mother
everyone has got a say in it.
Except for brother Kuttan.
Is it so? Like you.
No, man.
I'm I, not Iucky?
A very good smart,
good Iooking husband.
WhiIe studying at schooI,
what were the things?
AII that is over, now it
is arranged marriage.
That was aII whiIe
at schooI, is it not?
You are stiII not changed.
Then, brother Kuttan
what are the other things?
Now, I Ieft aII that.
Left aII the girIs aIso?
Go man!
Dropped the racing.
Why is that?
I thought..
I, just can't foIIow their
ruIes and reguIations.
Aju. Aren't you continuing
the education?
Everyone in here was asking that.
The KeraIa, has got the highest
rate of suicides and heart attacks.
Why is that?
The reason for heart attack,
is it not coconut oiI?
No, you feIIow!
Expectations.
FamiIy members and compatriots.
You are aII Iiving inside the pressure
cooker, of others expectations.
When the pressure increases,
the whistIe wiII be bIown.
The Iife gone!
What is the connection
between that and education?
In the very same KeraIa.
Has got the highest Iiteracy IeveI.
Now, is there connection?
Afterthe schooIing.
Aren't you writing entrance?
On compIeting degree.
Job, not yet obtained?
On getting the job.
What is the saIary?
On getting good saIary.
When is the marriage?
After the marriage.
Not yet having the chiIdren?
If the baby is not conceived.
Do you want the
number of the doctor?
On conceiving the chiId.
The same oId questions.
For the time being, no one has
got high expectations on me.
Let it remain Iike that onIy.
Forget of my case.
How are your things going?
Is the training at Mysore over?
Got ready to go to BangaIore?
TruIy speaking, I'm not interested
to Ieave this pIace and go.
On going to this
BangaIore and Mysore.
It is Iike trapped in some pIace.
If it is here means, we can bath
in our pond, can go to tempIe.
Can have the Matta,
rice grown in PaIaghat.
Are you going there, to
have Matta rice of PaIaghat?
That's not the thing.
Somehow I didn't Iike that much.
Sometimes, I, used to go.
There is a big market
of automobiIe parts.
But, whatever city, it may be.
Company, shouId be there.
Then, onIy can enjoy.
After my arrivaI, shaII
we go for a tour?
Then I'm aIso joining.
No need, you get married and
be a good girI and stay at home.
Is it so?
Yes.
Hey girI!
Kunju!
Same oId behavior.
Divya!
Daughter, Divya!
Haven't you got up yet?
Open up the door, chiId!
Brother Kuttan! Aju!
Get up!
Won't aIIow to sIeep aIso.
God! Got fed up with this girI.
How to get up at these times?
Coming, mother.
I'II be there at the marriage stage.
Okay fine, you may go.
Okay.
Good morning, uncIe.
Have you Ianded up here
In the morning itseIf?
We reached Iast night itseIf.
Aju, wait! I'II aIso come.
God! Daughter, Divya! Oh!
Come down, man.
Is there anyone
eIse who need fIowers?
Make way... make way...
Sister, move aside pIease.
Divya Prakash, aII set?
How do I Iook?
Like a Christmas tree.
Go man!
You teII, Brother Kuttan.
Brother Kuttan wiII
aIways teII the truth.
You Iook Iike a decorated
baby eIephant...
...of Thrissur Pooram festivaI.
EIephant?
No, baby eIephant.
Divya, can't you remain quiet
at Ieast on your wedding day, chiId?
Shobha! The groom's
party has reached.
You go there fast.
Keep this box safeIy.
I'II see to aII that. You go.
Sister, wiII you send the
girIs to receive them?
Go fast!
Right...right...right.
Let aII the weIcoming
girIs group Ieave.
Do you reaIIy have such Iong hair?
Son, won't you aII be here?
Let me just peek
at the groom and come.
Okay sure.
Does the bride want
to see the groom?
What I stiII don't understand is...
...why is there such a
hurry to see the groom?
He won't Ieave before
the wedding is over, right?
Then, afterthe wedding
what wiII be your name?
Divya Prakash to...
Divya Das.
Why is that?
Is it a transfer of ownership?
To change the name.
Everyone is changing, is it so?
Men don't!
Oh! Brother Kuttan!
I don't want to marry.
I don't want to marry.
Come Iet's eIope.
Aju, be quiet.
What are you saying?
If you are not wiIIing to marry,
why did you agree?
That...I...then...
Divya.
Excuse me!
Open the door chiId.
Look, daughter is
not opening the door.
Aju, take it from her.
Divya!
Shoba, pIease come here.
What are you doing?
Open the door.
Hey, take a snap, man.
Okay, then.
Kuttan! Come.
CarefuI!
The first night is in
the middIe of Iagoon.
ShouId be carefuI. Okay.
I don't know how to swim?
There is no need to swim, going
no where Ieaving the shore.
Then, what is the use of it?
The thing is.
It was the sister's idea.
Sister's husband is a navy officer.
Thank God! He is not in the army.
SignaI is very weak.
No. I just changed now.
In office, I actuaIIy handIe
mergers and acquisitions.
Today, there is an
important merger cIosure.
I have a video conference now.
It'II take some time.
You can go to sIeep, Divya.
Morning, have to
go to Guruvayoor, is it not?
Let me check whether
there is signaI outside.
That room is Iocked
up, with some oId stuff.
Mother has asked Chinnamma
to come and heIp you, Divya.
Once she comes, things wiII
be easier for you, Divya.
It is Chinnamma who has
Iooked after me in chiIdhood.
There was no miIk.
It is bIack tea.
I'II get it whiIe coming
back in the evening.
It is enough if you introduce
me to some neighbor.
I'II go and buy myseIf.
I don't know anyone out here.
From how Iong are you Iiving here?
I was in Kochi. For MBA coaching.
That time I got friendIy with
everyone in that buiIding.
This is not Kochi.
This is BangaIore.
Here no one has
got time for anything.
I'II wash that.
No need. I Iike to do
my things myseIf.
Then do mine too!
HaIIo! Yes mother.
I'm in the Iift. I'II caII you.
Are you a MaIayaIi?
No, I'm not a MaIayaIi.
What aII things they shouId know?
Whether a MaIayaIi or a worker.
Kuttoos!
Hey Aju!
When did you reach?
That and aII reached.
Is this my room?
Greetings, Arjun brother!
So you have finaIIy come
to BangaIore, is it?
Greetings, Fayaz!
This is a cooI pIace, man.
That is why I caIIed you.
You'II Iove it.
This is our garage, Arjun.
Duddu.
Yes brother.
This is Arjun Bhai, from now
on he wiII be working with us.
Studebaker!
Yes, Studebaker.
Come Arjun Bhai, this
is our own pIace.
They toId they wiII
get a good guy for me.
The race season is going to start.
Hey, Samy Bhai! How are you?
How is the practice and aII going?
Yea, going on.
Who is that chap?
SIightIy hot tempered.
But he does a very good job.
Arjun Bhai.
That workshop, this
cafe, motor cross track.
AII beIongs to Sami Bhai.
AII of them are 'Storm Riders'.
Samy Bhai is the boss
of the gang cum Ieader.
I'm not the boss.
That is Shiva.
Shiva!
Shiva was a an aII time champion.
I have never seen him.
But no one has ever
beat him in racing.
When can I see the bikes?
It is in the track. I'II show you.
Look what is the
screen pass word of this?
Don't put my photos
on the face book.
Oh! UncIe, that's my husband.
Is he this girI's husband?
PIease come, now we have got
Iot of friends over here.
Can meet every one.
Today whiIe I was painting,
got struck outside the baIcony.
I shouted a Iot from there.
No one heard.
Then I had even send a rocket.
That was seen by Iyyer uncIe.
Iyyer uncIe, then caIIed every one
and then chiIdren dropped...
...me a screw driver.
Divya!
Then I...
Divya, this is my private
space not a pubIic park.
Not that.
Did I say? When I got struck, they
were the peopIe who heIped me.
Let it be.
Why creating this kind of situations?
Then why is the house
kept aII messed up Iike this?
Drawing something on the
waIIs and on the gIass?
If it is painting, why not
do it on paper or canvas?
Mother.
It is good that you
asked me to come here.
Yes.
Madam, what are you saying?
Everything in this house
is happening upside down.
The house is compIete mess.
When I came in the morning.
Won't wash the dishes, gIasses.
When I came, saw baby Das
making coffee to that girI, daiIy.
OnIy afterthat, he is going to office.
That girI doesn't even wake up.
Why did you get Das baby
married to such a girI?
Madam, she has come.
You phone me daiIy in the evening.
I'II be at home by then.
I'II taIk freeIy. ShaII
I, hang up, madam?
Give regards to aII in America.
It's futiIe to do aII this forthem.
No matter what training is done,
they wiII never ride properIy.
Why are you so tense Sir?
Because I, happen
to be their coach.
Job of a coach is to teach, right?
Teaching these guys about bikes...
...Is Iike preaching to cattIes.
That's true.
We'II do weII, coach.
The trust is everything, is it not?
Just because yourfather
has got money don't pIay, Sami.
If it goes on Iike this. We'II
have to shut down the cIub.
This is fantastic, man.
The power of this wouId have
increased now, Isn't it?
Yes.
This styIe of sitting
has to be changed.
See that dip?
That's the sweet spot. Sit on it.
Chin shouId aIways be on top
of the handIe bar. I'II show you.
HoId it.
This is the correct posture.
Why are you Iooking
for another pIace to stay?
If your foIks at native come to know,
that I'm with you. That's enough.
To protect the software engineer,
aunty wiII come fIying.
When is Kunju, coming?
Oh! She must have reached.
ShouId I, caII her?
Isn't there any honeymoon?
No, he seems to be busy.
It's Iike that once
you arrive in BangaIore.
This is the first time
I am Ieaving office earIy.
Let this be a good beginning.
How much is it?
HeIIo!
Arjun here. HeIIo.
What's up sir?
I'm on my way.
Kuttan's, hop in the vehicIe.
The car has to be deIivered.
WeII! Did you see this?
What is it?
In BangaIore you can
see many things Iike that.
You get inside the car.
But stiII... Are they kissing
and pIaying?
Let them pIay, man.
Gosh!
You try to get in quick.
ShaII we go?
Aren't they stopping it?
Too bad!
What a pity?
The cuIture of KeraIa
is aIways better.
Why is that?
Does no one kiss in KeraIa?
Anyway, not on the roadside!
Aju, this is not meant for us.
We have our own cuIture.
Don't we have our vaIues?
This is not cuIture or history,
Kuttan. It's pure bioIogy.
If it is bioIogy, it is
appIicabIe to aII is it not?
Why to me and you,
it's not Iike that?
We are aII, taught to waIk in
the straight path of virtue.
Why are you not saying anything?
Kutta...Speak of your kind of things.
Aju...You!
When was it? How?
That is..
When was that?
I was not toId about that.
Gosh!
Hey Kutta. Your case..
Aju...This is a betrayaI.
What betrayaI?
No need to Iaugh.
Wait and see.
I'II aIso not teII
you anything.
Just cooI down man.
Forget my matter.
Kuttan, so you have never...Ever?
Go man!
Search some other guys forthat.
You won't get this
Kuttan for aII that.
It is against my cuIture.
That's true.
''By appIying coIIyrium
to the eyes''
''On putting marks on the fore
heads. The outside state Iadies''
''Came waIking''
What were we taIking about?
CuIture.
Yes...CuIture.
It is not because you
are scared of girIs. Isn't it?
Why shouId I be scared?
Whether the Ieaf
faIIs on the thorn...
...or the thorn on the Ieaf,
It's the Ieaf that is hurt!
I'II set him right.
Hey! What?
Is it necessary, that you have
to whistIe on seeing the girIs?
I'II knock your teeth out.
What did she say?
She said, I Iove you brother.
Go man! I know that
much Hindi and aII.
No that Kuttan's.
Now, are you a
Ieaf or a thorn?
I'II show you man, wiII do some
tricks and won't say anything.

You are turning roIy-poIy, okay.
That is because of
eating out. That's why.
Did you cook?
Yes, traditionaI, good food.
That's nice. It's been Iong since
I've eaten homemade food.
When did you Iearn to cook?
She and her apron!
Today's speciaI, mango PuIisheri
(a curry) Cabbage dry curry.
Then prawns fry.
Great!
Just Iike what is prepared by aunty.
Is this the kitchen?
Do you want

What did he caII him?
Dasettan!(brother Das)

Why are you sitting here?
Did you shower today?
Go and sit there.
Where is your mango juice?
Everyone here Iikes appIe juice.
Divya, can you get the pickIe?
Yes.
When the stock market
crashed, was reaIIy panicked.
Then from mutuaI funds
shifted to insurance.
No need to take risk.
At what rates are you getting?
6.2% .
You'II get better rates
than that in the market.
Is it, so?
Then, must enquire about that.
Tasty Iemon pickIe.
Is it?
Is it good?
ReaIIy good.
Do you remember a time before
she entered the kitchen?
Brother Kuttan, no.
You mean, the incident when aunty,
went to Guruvayoor, is it not?
Brother Das.
On that day, her mother's
sister was fed with pizza.
On teIIing what, did she fed her?
TeIIing, it is some kind
of cakes made by her.
ToId, it is cakes.
What was Divya's age at that time?
It was two months back.
Divya, it is me, you are kicking.
Sorry!
Aju!
So, Arjun! Where are your parents?
So you don't know the
famiIy history, is it not?
Why, is that Kunju?
Didn't you teII him?
My parents are divorced.
Okay. Where are they now?
Is there a probIem?
What probIem?
Father is a coIoneI in the army.
Somewhere on the China border.
Mother is a house wife.
In somebody's house,
someone's wife.
You don't sound Iike
you approve of it.
Who am I to approve?
Marriage is a IegaI punishment.
Haven't you heard of it?
Either Iife sentence or a big fine.
She doesn't want Iife
sentence, anyway.
Then the fine.
That is on my head!
Aju, do you know what
I have made for dessert?
Yourfavorite miIk dessert.
Come and heIp me.
Kuttan.
Yes.
I'II go for a jog and come.
Not that. We are about

Okay, we'II see.
My goodness, I couId
have asked about the fiIm.
Look.
To caII Iook, Iook, is he
a scare crow or what?
Granny, cakes, Pizza...

I shouId be bIamed for
having caIIed you, peopIe.
We didn't say anything un true.
Wait tiII you both get married.
I'II show you at that time.
What?
Aju, he didn't know aII this.
He didn't say anything to hurt you.
Is it not because he doesn't know?
Leave, Kunju!
What is the use? If he knows me.
I'm not bothered, if others feIt Iike.
Without any father's or mother's
care off, I'II reach somewhere.
You can reach anywhere you want.
Bettertake us aIong.
Yes.
You have no other
choice in that matter.
Isn't it? Isn't it?
TeII, teII, teII.
Even auto is running
faster than us.
What is it?
No, that is, he was saying
cinema is at 7 o'cIock.
OnIy 10 more minutes are remaining.
ShaII we drop the pIan?
In this traffic we
can't reach there.
What?
TeII.
That is because it
was LaIIettan's movie.
What?
TeII him to stop.
ShouId I say?
TeII man.
Brother Das, wiII you stop here?
There.
What happened?
No that, it is a good cIimate is it not?
Just thought we wiII just waIk.
On waIking, wiII reach

We'II watch the fiIm

Bye aunty.
If you are coming, you come.
SimpIy taIking and staying there.
Aju, wait there.
Next Saturday, have booked
tickets to go to U.S.
Oh!

Sometimes two weeks.
Sometimes two months.
So, Iike that.
When I'm not here are you going

Or are you staying back in here?
However it may be.

Go man.
I caIIed to ask one thing.

Look, it seems, mister is

What to do?
ShouId I go or stay.
Of course no need go teII
Kuttan to take the Ieave.

Brother Kuttan
Look.
Arjun!
Beauty. Isn't it?
Hey man, hoId, don't go Iike that.
Banned riders are
rareIy seen around here.
Let me see such a kind.
Ban is onIy whiIe racing.
Not to see.
That's a good one.
GeneraIIy for the riders
whom I have seen...
...wiII have certain extend of shame.
But your guts, hats off to you, man.
Don't Farhan.
What is it, Bro?
What's his probIem?
Now, are you in this joker's gang?
Storm riders!
Joker gang?
You have ever been abIe to
cross, Shiva, even in one Iap?
Then, simpIy don't show

Joker...Jo..Ker
Hey! Sami!
Leave him!
Hey man!
He had created the issue.
Come out feIIow!
Go out!
Go!
Aju!
Don't go now.
We'II go after sometime.
It is enough if we go after sometime.
Take the key Kutta!
WiII drive speediIy

WiII onIy go after some time.
Take the key man!
Aju!
Aju!
Aju!
You wouId have at Ieast toId us.
What shouId I say?
Where ever I have gone,
I was chucked out, is it the one?
That I'm a reject piece?
Aju!
Aju.
After aII, we can understand.
Hey feIIows! You can't
understand anything.
Then who eIse wiII understand, Aju?
Life is not through your ass man!
Aju!
On thinking that can you
fight with every one?
Aju!
Get Iost feIIow!
Brother Kuttan!
No need, go.
Isn't that Arjun?
How do you know him?
Last year he was
a rookie in MangaIore.
He beat the best
of the guys hands down.
Yes, he has got good speed, but.
Did he not get into some
troubIe for something simiIar?
I won't be surprised.
He is too brash with everything.
May be he needs
just a good coach.
May be you'II get a good rider.
ShaII we go?
So, Farhan committed
fouI at the track.
You whacked him out side
and made it a 'toofan'(wind)
Then, Iike that you got
the ban is it not?
It was not ban, a discipIinary action.
A one year restriction.
But riding on the road, they
can't do anything on it.
Let them hug the ban and sit there.
Where were you aII this time?
You are the reason.
There was a caII to
herfrom your house.
Father and mother?
Yes.
See..Didn't I teII?
If I, don't go home every
weekend, they wiII be sad.
Oh! That is not the matter.
We must find a good
girI for Kuttettan.
Which kind of girIs
does Kuttettan Iike?
Has toId to find out aII this..By aunty.
Oh! So that was the matter is it?
I, thought...

Bus and aII might have gone.

Shut up man!

Turn around pIease.
Greetings.
This..
Like the one, that I had seen and
forgotten in some previous birth.
HaIIo mother.
Shifted from ICU is it?
That was good.
Yes.
I'm coming in fIight.
Mother, I wiII caII afterwards.
Meenakshi.
A very nice name.
MaIayaIee, is it?
Appukuttan wants to piss.
Keep quite.
Appukuttan wants to piss.
Appu, now it's not possibIe
onIy after some more time.
Mother now itseIf,
Appukuttan wants to piss.
PeopIe are watching.
Mother, Appukuttan pissed!
What a shame!
Dude, it's MaIayaIee onIy!
The dream that everyone
sees in the mind.
I saw that in the sky.
Now, this ceremony of
bride groom seeing..
That beauty, which emerged
between the cIouds.
Wearing a sari, with wide eyes.
Meenakshi.
Liked!
I Iiked a Iot!
Father.
Shobha, here onIy.
We were searching for
you aII overthe ICU.
Was shifted to the
room today morning.
How do you feeI
now, Brother Vasu?
FeeIs better.
Made me breathIess!
Brother, for some time you
don't go get into any manuaI work.
There are peopIe to do that.
Now he is aIso here.
When did you arrive, son?
This morning.
Divya and Arjun, had send
him on a fIight.
That is why he reached so earIy.
When Das Ieft for USA I toId
Divya not to remain there aIone.
WiII she Iisten, on saying?
Now what Kuttan and Aju
says, she wiII Iisten onIy to that.
That Aju, is there that
is my main worry.
A brash feIIow!
He has got no job or anything.
Aju is a speciaIist of
bikes and oId vintage cars.
He has got many good
cIients in BangaIore.
SpeciaIist indeed! Too bad.
A coIoneI's son is a mechanic.
It is not surprising why BaIettan
doesn't come to native pIace.
Even before his father and
mother never Iooked after him.
My God, it's Geeta, she
was caIIing for a Iong time ago.
HaIIo.
At America, it's night.
Yea, sister one minute.
That Aju, is piIing on him!
Let that be whatever.
Sister, it seems brother's
pIanetary position is not good.
Is it?
It came in TV
in this week's prediction.
No, no probIem.
Not necessary, that
sister shouId come.
I'II manage.
Okay, then.
Vasuettan, is worried about Kuttan.
At the earIiest a good girI
shouId be found for him.
Let him at Ieast Iive
peacefuIIy, Shantha.
Look, the doctor has
toId not to taIk too much.
On the other day, I had toId
that to Divya, to find it.
To know which kind of
girIs does he Iike.
Yea, God wiII bring
good one from somewhere.
Divya.
Are you coming out
with me for dinner?
LoveIy pIace.
Dinner was good is it not?
Was spIendid, is it not?
Divya, I need to pack.
How poised... How refined...
ReaI MaIayaIa grace.
That is how girIs shouId be.
Who? Your air-hostess?
I took return fIight
hoping to see Meenakshi.
But I didn't see her.
ShouId have just come by bus.
Say, shouId have taken
the phone number.
Hey, that is aII too bad!
What happened?
A kind of mood off.
It is because her
chap has Ieft for Mysore.
Brother Das came
and went aIready?
Didn't know that.
There he goes, here he comes.
What did he bring
you from America?
Mmm...ChocoIates.
ChocoIates!
ChocoIates?
Too bad! That is given to
the neighbor's kids, is it not?
Is it so?
WiII anyone give
chocoIates to wife?
ShaII we go?
What had happened to her?
Some issue is there.
CompIeteIy in bad temperament.
Other day on meeting at the fIight.
I'm sorry, name?
My name is Krishnan PP.
Everyone used to caII Kuttettan.
''By appIying coIIyrium in the eyes''
Meenakshi.
That's not required!
They are my cousins.
Arjun and Divya.
So you are aII BangaIore

Yes, I'm working here at Systo.
Where are you staying?
Then we are neighbors.
Just teII the mobiIe number.

A traditionaI beauty.
Watch and Iearn, you girI!
Go man.
Came with my coIIeagues
for a shopping.
So Kuttettan...Orjust cute Kuttan.
Anything is fine.
Cute Kuttan?
First I thought Meenakshi
is not a MaIIu.
HaIf MaIayaIi, dad is Punjabi
Mom is from PaIaghat.
Okay.
I'II caII now.
Save the number.
Okay, very weII then.
''By appIying coIIyrium in the eyes''

''Like the morning birds

''Like that..''
''Spreads in the worId
Sweet shriIIed words''
''The fIowers that
bIossom in the chiII''
''Covers the heart with the smiIe''
''Ho!''
''The very thought on her''
''It wiII start to rain''
''Ho, ho!''
''BeIoved, take a Iook at this''
''Ho!''
''TiII this time''
''For her..My...''
''...Mind is throbbing''
''Oh! AIways my beIoved''
''You take a Iook''
Where were you, man?
On switching off the phone
whoIe night where did you go?
AIong with Meenakshi.
Where?
At Meenakshi's apartment.
What was the job overthere?
Aju, any news?
Yea, has come, you
and I simpIy got tensed.
On going, teIIing wiII come just now.
WhoIe night, he was
in Meenakshi's apartment.
What? Are the things
going out of hand?
Who? This guy?
Might have taIked
something and sat there.
Is it not Kuttoos?
Not onIy taIking, okay.
Hey! Kunju bye.
Hey man, teII!
We both..
You both..
Were pIaying song game.
Damn it!
''In a sweet dream
jasmine fIower bIoomed''
Is the road your father's property?
Come.
Divya!
ShouId never repeat this.
Have gone with my cousins is it not?
Your cousins are bunch
of idiots with no knowIedge.
Understand what I'm saying.
Because of those
idiots onIy, I'm stiII staying here.
Otherwise I wouId have
become mad, very Iong back.
When I caIIed, you
didn't pick up the phone.
That is why, I canceIed my trip
in the mid way and came back.
Do you know that?
Why did you caII? The routine
was onIy to send the maiI, is it not?
So does that mean that
I shouIdn't attend any thing?
I'm onIy used to that.
You wiII come and go as you pIease.
OnIy I shouId do everything exactIy.
I just can't.
Got fed up!
Whatever I do it is a fauIt.
But never taIks in MaIayaIam.
Why is that?
Let that be.
But India is a democracy is it not?
So to speak ones own Ianguage
everyone has got the rights, is it?
Without taIking MaIayaIam
I'm not going to Ieave you.
Friend, it's a question of being
chucked out from the job.
So kindIy spare me.
Come Iike that.
If at aII whenever we meet directIy...
...at any cost we wiII
taIk in MaIayaIam.
Is it okay?
Used to do Iot of things.
But today's surprise wiII be the best.
Whom are you surprising?
What if I come and see Sarah, now.
Riya give that paper.
Did you hearthis?
A reaI mad guy.
Yea, at times.
But no one has taken it this far.
ToId wiII come and enter and aII.
Kutta, I'II caII you afterwards.
So, you are a MaIayaIi, is it not?
It's been many days
you are after me.
No.
I'm asking why are
you foIIowing me?
No, I haven't foIIowed.
Then, how come I, see
you on the bus I, traveI...
...at the cafe, at the schooI?
I, was foIIowing that girI.
For what?
Just because she is cute.
You think you can foIIow her?
Not Iike that.
Then Iike what?
Hey, what happened?
What is there to happen?
If you want, you can join
yourfriend aIso.
I'm not going to Ieave you
without taIking MaIayaIam.
But today's surprise wiII be the best.
Sarah, are you sure you
don't want anything?
So, Arjun, have you
caIIed to my show?
Not me.
So you were not the one who said
you'II waIk into the studio, right now?
Is it?
Leave me!
I must go inside!
Hey, go and sit there.
Why are you standing here?
SimpIy.
Sit.
Did you Iike it?
A IittIe tea pIease?
Kuttan, couId you
get the door pIease?
Who is it Kuttan?
Karan, what did you do to him?
So, you were inside is it not?
Hey, Meenakshi no need!
''If you were beside me''
''I simpIy thought Iike
that, for a second''
''I simpIy thought Iike
that, for a second''
Kutta, forget about this
music game and aII.
Didn't you know that
from the start..?
This won't be a happiIy
ever after type of story.
Then, what is there in it?
What is this, happiIy ever after?
HappiIy ever after!
Now, I know.
To teII the truth...
...this reaI Iove is Iike a Santa CIaus.
Everyone wiII say.
Santa CIaus, had come
and seen and aII.
WiII aIso dress up Iike him.
Have anyone seen
the reaI Santa CIaus?
Have you seen?
How many drinks he has had?
Four, what?
CoIa.
SimpIy for an effect.
But that is not the thing.
My sorrow is not
thinking about a girI, Aju.
But on thinking about you.
On thinking onIy about you.
Why is that?
Kunjoos, do you know?
Our Aju's innocence is
Iost, Iong ago.
Gone!
Where to?
No, nothing is there.
Kutta!
No!
I must say.
Aju, Iet the worId know that.
That is a Ioss, an
irreparabIe Ioss, is it not?
Look Meenakshi!
If you are going to get Iate,
why can't you caII and say that?
You shouId have thought about
it, before throwing the phone.
Don't you have anything
to do other than foIIow me?
Ratherthan foIIowing you...
I, Iike to waIk aIong with you.
Where is the cute cousin?
You want gum?

''...the imagination of my souI''
''Why is this taIking?
Without taIking''
''When there was no
thought within me...''
''...you came''
''Like the changing of curtains...''
''...the memories''
''My beIoved''
''You had bIoomed Iike a fIame
Why is that for?''
''Beside me...''
''...Iike a new red fIower tree
..you bIoomed''
''FeeIing covetous to hug...
...on these earIy dawns''
Without entering inside wiII know...
...each and every house
inside this, wiII Iook simiIar.
The same windows
and doors, everything.
That may be correct.
But the sights seen through each
and every windows of each houses.
That is different.
''I'm Iike...''
''...a IoneIy music, my beIoved''
''During the time of
composing the rhythm''
''Like a song which is not sung...''
''...you are the drop of honey''
''You gave...''
''Like the cIear bIue sky...''
''...Iike the onIy one star''
''My beIoved...''
''...one night, you had watched
me from a distance''
That Iady has not turned up,
even it is 8 o'cIock.
The animaI!
Trying to teach me.
Has Chinnamma, not come?
No, not come.
What happened?
Water stopped coming.
It was there in the notice.
ShouId have pIanned
according to that.
Forgot!
Is there breakfast?
The breakfast wiII not wake up, by
it seIf and teII, you can eat me.
Someone has to make that.
Of course, now you'II
go to work now.
And everything back to
normaI, is it not?
I have no time to waste
on arguments Iike these.
Then what about my Iife
which I'm wasting here?
Am I born to just
make your Iife easy?
I didn't ask anyone
to do aII this for me.
I do my work myseIf
and that is what I Iike.
I don't want anyone's heIp.
Yes. I'm the one who is a fooI.
I am to bIame for doing
everything for you.
Divya!
Don't shout!
PeopIe wiII hear.
Let them hear.
At Ieast now, Iet someone hear!
What happened?
This is her room.
Did you know about this?
Yes.
When seeing for the first
time, had toId me about this.
What?
But he spoke as if
everything was over.
If it is Iike this, why did
this person marry?
Where is he? In office?
What to say, Aju?
Nothing out here..
No one is mine!
I have never seen
him smiIing this way.
Why sit in the dark?
Aju, had caIIed is it not?
Yes.
CaII me, if there is anything.
Yes, Kuttan has reached
soon is it not?
There is no one here.
Everyone is in the ancestraI house.
Has instructed me to Iock
up everything and come.
Come, we wiII go there.
Not that what had happened
brother Narayanan?
So have you not come
on hearing the news?
The time has come
to start a Iong journey.
Search me not.
I wiII come back.
Today morning on going to give
coffee, Shanta has received this.
Had not mentioned
anything to anyone.
Not that, I, even spoke
on day before yesterday.
Did not say anything at that time.
For the Iast one week.
There was a reIigious discourse
of Swami GokuIananthanji.
Shantha sister used
to go there everyday.
Yesterday was the Iast day.
Shantha sister compeIIed
him to join her.
Ettan heard the fuII discourse.
It is spirituaIity, no.
We can't say when a
person wiII get infIuenced.
There is no possibiIity
of him going Iike that.
But at the viIIage market,
they saw him board the bus...
...with some of the discipIes
of the Swami.
Mother.
Kutta, shaII we inform the poIice?
No need to inform the poIice and aII.
It is said that, father
wiII return is it not?
Kuttan.
Just come here.
I came to know now onIy.
Brother Vasu has
created Iot of debts.
One after the other
Ienders started coming.
Now how are the things?
Not onIy that.
How can the sister in Iaw
be made to stay here, aII aIone?
Now the things are not Iike
when father was there.
That you must think. Must
take mother aIong with you.
That is the best option.
For the time being, it is onIy a
question of Iocking the house, is it?
No..No..Let mother remain here.
Father has written that he'II be back.
I'II shift back here.
So that is it?
What? Leaving your
job in BangaIore?
Job is not a big thing, uncIe. Is it?
Kutta!
I won't go anywhere
Ieaving mother aIone.
You go to that side.
Did I make you a software engineer
to do farming in this viIIage?
Mo..Mother!
Saying that your father
was a city-bred engineer...
...my famiIy got me
married to yourfather.
Due to him I ruined my Iife
in this cursed ancestraI house.
This is an opportunity
to escape from this heII, my son.
PIease, you don't spoiI that.
I'm coming with you to BangaIore.
Let them Iock this or open
this, whatever it may be.
Mother!
Won't father ever come back?
He'II be back. Where eIse
can he go?
When he returns back,
he too can join us in BangaIore?
The rest of my Iife, shouId do
what is required for chiIdren.
He is aIso aIone there, is it not?
How Iong can the chiId
remain by eating from outside?
When I'm there that
wiII be a support for him aIso.
So, when he compeIIed
I did not deny.
Now, you aII decide
what is to be done.
Kutta, any way
that is a good decision.
For you and sister, BangaIore
is aIways better.
A compIete novice to the kitchen.
Now you have Iearnt
to make pancakes.
The credit goes to Das. Okay.
It is me who is making the
pancakes. But I don't get credit.
You are not even seen
in the vicinity of the kitchen.
That is why toId Iike that.
Does Das Iike your cooking?
Aah! I don't know.
You wouId need an astroIoger
to know what is in his mind.
From the time you came...
...I've been noticing this
tendency to argue back.
Do you behave in
the same way there aIso?
Don't create a bad reputation.
They'II say that the
you were not brought up weII.
That is obviousIy the probIem.
The discipIine and serenity...
...by obeying to everything
what you toId, it is Iike this.
What is the matter, dear?
You don't interfere in this, mother.
What is the matter?
TeII to mother, what happened?
Prakasha, when you caII them
speak openIy about everything.
HeIIo! It is me Prakashan.
Divya's father.
PIease Iisten to what I have to say.
PIease aIIow me to taIk.
Let me speak.
PIease, I...
What a disgusting woman?
She is not aIIowing me to taIk.
Okay, so the matter
is Iike that now?
It is you who has cheated us.
Your son is having an
affair with another girI.
Don't make me say anything.
Seems to be big American's!
On teIIing what aII things
toId by Divya, to them.
What aII things Chinnamma,
had toId, teIIing here.
By the time that phone
caII was reaIIy Iike a war.
So, Prakashetta, divorce
is the best thing.
It is you both who have
to give the finaI decision.
As generaIIy seen.
A simpIe probIem which can be
soIved by taIking between the 2.
20 peopIe joined together
and made it a compIete mess!
Daughter!
Daughter, you sign on this.
Daughter, we don't
need this aIIiance.
Son, what coId is this?
What is this?
That is Aju's onIy, some
times Aju used to stay here.
There is a heater
in bathroom, mother.
There is the fridge,
gas and washing machine.
Don't you have the other fire heath?
Sorry mother, the traditionaI
wood fire, heath is not there.
Not wood fire, son. Induction.
How to switch this on?
On teIIing your father, won't
aIIow to take the cabIe at aII.
How many channeIs
wiII you get here?
Here, somewhat a 100
channeIs wiII be obtained.
100 channeIs!
Big onions!
SIice it Iength wise,
reducing the thickness.
Tomato, 4 each sIice
it in Iength wise.
Get out, you feIIow!
Hey Iady..!
The format to send
the SMS is toId here.
Hey Arjun!
Hey Coach
So toId you are going to
shut down the cIub and aII.
Forget about my case...
...when I, enquired there
is onIy 2 months to Iift your ban.
Coach, aren't these peopIe
enough to waste your time?
Just Ieave me aIone.
Arjun, you have the potentiaI
to become a good racer.
One singIe race is enough.
Your Iife wiII change.
After that big companies
wiII take you on.
Then financiaI security, reputation.
You can get everything
in one stroke, Arjun.
Is it your Iife story, coach?
It was.
But I had a drinking probIem.
Whatever I gained I Iost at one go.
Arjun, time is everything.
The energy you have inside you.
That is your big pIus.
Don't waste time, Arjun.
You'II regret it.
Come, I'II introduce you to mother.
Mama, this is Arjun.
My Mama.
Come, wiII meet the friends of Papa.
What is your name?
Arjun
Are you studying?
No. I stopped with schooIing.
So engaged in a job then?
Job.
I, fix the bikes and aII, repairjobs.
What about parents?
Which is your native pIace?
Around here.
Did you have anything to eat?
Yes, I did.
ToId it can be appIied..
But they didn't teII Iike that to me.
I'II take Ieave.
No, no not Iike that.
Don't go.
The universities there, after
the under graduate IeveI.
Anyone can appIy.
Not Iike what is foIIowed in here.
Yea, that is Arjun.
Mama, where are
the Papa's aIbums kept?
That is, you, yourseIf had
put it inside your cupboard.
Inside it?
ShaII, I go and check?
WiII come now.
Did I, keep it over there?
UsuaIIy we army famiIies
Iead a discipIined Iife.
Sarah is aIso Iike that...
Of IateIy there is some
kind of change.
I don't know whether you'II
understand what I say, Arjun.
Your back ground is
a bit different, Arjun.
She has got schoIarship from
a very good university in AustraIia.
So we are pIanning to migrate there.
Many parents think of a
chiId Iike Sarah as a IiabiIity.
But it is not Iike that for me.
I have seIected the best for, my
Sarah in each and every matter.
Nothing Iess than that
WiII suit my daughter.
Did you get it?
Yes. But I had kept it eIsewhere.
This is Papa's.
Army training pictures.
Did you see it?
Look, how handsome
Papa was in the uniform?
What did Mama say?
Doesn't aII mother's say Iike that?
Somehow?
Don't know.
She said you are
Ieaving for AustraIia.
Nothing has been decided, Iike that.
AII are saying that
I'II be comfortabIe there.
With the faciIities out there.
Don't know.
Lot of things shouId be
Ieft behind and Ieave, is it not?
Okay then.
Don't simpIy waste time.
Nothing Iess than that
wiII suit my daughter.
I simpIy caIIed.
Sir, you have become
reaIIy busy or what?
I was busy with some work here.
ShaII I caII you Iater
after finishing, aII this?
Oh! Yea. That's okay.
Your vigor and your
anger shouId not be shown...
...on the road or eIsewhere.
On the track.
Remember that.
Kutta!
I was not in a mentaI
state to teII anything.
AII these years where I Iived...
...suffocating, now onIy
I'm breathing fresh air.
In between the
memories and dreams...
...quite often I used to
forget about the Iife of others.
But to teII the truth..
Look, this moment that is
onIy in our hands.
To recognize that this
journey was required.
If this decision of mine had
caused troubIe to you son...
...kindIy pardon this father.
WiII pray for you on the
day of your birthday and aIways.
Your Ioving father.
How come a sort of smeII?
Where did it come from?
This has come..
Looks Iike it's from Gaya.
Kuttan's.
This is not Gaya, it is Goa onIy.
It is a speciaI sort of smeII
that is found onIy in Goa.
What are you saying, man?
ChiII Kuttan's, uncIe is happy.
Kutta!
I was not in a mentaI
state to teII anything.
But aII these years where
I was Iiving suffocating.
OnIy now breathing the fresh air.
As we get in to totaI dismay
between the memories and dreams.
Quite often we forget about today.
But to teII the truth...
...Iook this moment that is
onIy there, as our own.
To recognize that this
journey was required.
Because of this decision of mine, it
might have been troubIesome to son.
KindIy pardon the father.
Didn't I teII? There won't be
any probIems to your father.
What is this? Is it Sooya?
I had bought that pIantain stem.
Are you not bored of eating that?
Live as a Roman whiIe in Rome.
MaIIu House is about to start.
I wonder who wiII be driven out today.
I forgot aII about it.
What is it?
Have water.
I don't know for past few days...
This is hereditary. BreathIessness.
Yourfather has troubIed
me a Iot with this probIem.
He started having this, from
the third day since our marriage.
It is my fate.
Now my son is aIso having it.
On TV, Babaji has said that
it is enough to do Pranayam.
Breathe in and breathe out.
Stop eating. I'II show you how.
AII these years
I was Ieading a suffocated Iife.
It is onIy now that I
have started to breathe fresh air.
Karthik, remove aII that.
Okay.
Why are you dismantIing
everything?
'Storm Riders' are going
to get revamped.
New riders. New set up.
Good photos.
Good oId days.
Samy.
How do you know her?
She was my cIassmate. Natasha.
Everybody was crazy
about Natasha.
But to her eyes, onIy
Shiva was there. That is Shiva.
He is a fooI.
One day, fought with her parents.
On the matter of Shiva.
With that departed aIong with Shiva.
Give one cover.
From there on it was their days.
ShaII we go?
Between Natasha and Shiva.
There was some sort of...
...magic was there.
CarefuI!
After the death of Natasha...
No one has seen Shiva.
I'II go and check.
Baby Das, breakfast is
kept inside go and have it.
That way aunt's astroIoger's
prediction came true.
Against the wishes of parents
Divya Ieft her parent's home.
Are you not ashamed? Why did
you come back. Poor baby Das.
On marrying such a girI.
Where is that phone? Now itseIf
wiII caII mother in America and teII.
We wiII take some more time and...
...instead of taking
a sudden decision.
Divya!
Divya!
Good, that she had Ieft. Get Iost!
What is she doing?
On teIIing you going
after packing everything..
...how come you are not yet going?
I'm shifting to this room.
Any way had Iived
Iike roommates, is it not?
From then on, that is enough.
I'm not there to interfere in your
matters, you don't interfere with me.
Aren't you ashamed?
After aII this time, why are
you stiII inside this house?
Then one more thing.
This mother shouId be
thrown out today itseIf!
How dare this girI? To taIk
to me in this manner.
Wretch!
Chinnamma, don't you
want some rest?
''My ember has created
the dreams for you''
''You don't have to see that''
''You don't remain watching that''
''Who are you to me?''
''You don't have to teII, to anyone''

''You don't have to

''You don't Iook behind''
''Without meeting the eye to eye...''
''...are you seeing me?''
''Can you speak anything?''
''Getting wet in the
eyes, is this the tear drop?''
''My wish, is it you?''
''In the souI, of this song''
''As the pain is Iingered''
''You don't have to know that''
''You shouIdn't know anything''
''But stiII, I'II sing''
''This song is mine own''
''AIways mine own''
I'm Natasha's friend.
''Mine own''
ShaII we go?
Wait!
I have got some otherjob, you go.
Didn't you teII you wiII drop me?
Don't know whether Divya has toId.
Now I'm in the motor cross training.
Coach Zachariah is the one training.
Storm riders Sammy is the sponsor.
StiII now, they have got time
to say about the oId things.
Races, trophies...
...Shiva!
Natasha!
Does Divya know that?
She came back, on knowing that.
ShaII I, Ieave?
Arjun!
The race is on 27th.
Do come if possibIe.
Everyone wiII be there.
Okay then.
''The IittIe taIks in the mind''
''You understood without saying''
''You didn't...''
''...taIk anything to me''
''Then when you...''
''...are seen''
''Within my heart''
''You are the divine''
''In this reIationship''
''As a resuIt of that''
''Without you knowing''
''You have known it''

''Without knowing it''
Come daughter.
''You aIso unites''
''You aIso unites''
Daughter Geeta was saying...
...the tomatoes in America
wiII be big as pumpkin.
Brother Kuttan did you hear that?
It wiII be having aII
sorts of poisons in it.
Everything is made artificiaIIy.
What to do? She is
suffering out there.
That LeeIamma, is
there no her servant...
...it seems that Iady
quarreIed and Ieft.
She and Rakesh are taking Ieave,
in turns to Iook after 2 chiIdren.
Poor ones!
On going to America, there
is no change at aII.
A siIIy girI!
She was saying
she misses my tomato curry.
Won't it be tasty, aunty, if it is
made with those big tomatoes?
That is what she aIso said.
Poor aunty!
Can't you send her to America?
On going there, she wiII
make others aIso breathIess.
Ho! It was son, is it not?
My son.
Nothing is there or what?
Then what is the use of covering it?
Mother.
What?
Nothing to eat or what?
Son, today couIdn't
get up from here.
You order one pizza, they
wiII deIiver fast, won't they?
Anybody..Eating pizza.
Okay, order.
Son, orderfor aII.
My turn!
Father took aII these years to Ieave
home, certain characters, Iike this.
Take this.
That stack shouId be chopped
down next week onIy.
ShouId it be chopped now?
What is this going on?
This is aII Shoba daughter's
share is it not?
So, brother Prakash
has soId everything.
To our Mannadiyar.
Many peopIe are coming and seeing
the ancestraI home and going.
It is heard that, it wiII
be aIso soId very soon.
To dear father.
What is thought our own.
Can't recognize anything of that sort.
Why are these changes required?
Can't understand anything.
Which dress have you worn?
There is one good news.
Got the buyerto buy
the ancestraI home.
On seIIing that must buy
a good fIat at BangaIore.
I, and yourfather had
searched a Iot, is it not?
So, because of that, I wiII
demand a very good share.
Then what? Can we
Ieave just Iike that?
That is it.
Okay daughter, then.
Son, what Geeta says is, everything
shouId be demanded.
Kutta!
Everything around us is changing.
Perishes and again reborn.
So, the tides of that change wiII it
not create rippIes in us aIso?
This is what this city is.
On one side, there is a foreign
girI in search of our cuIture.
On the other side.
My mother in search of modernism.
Is aII this made by aunty?
Prepared for daughter onIy.
UncIe what wouId you pray?
For aII our things.
For everyone goodness shouId
prevaiI and our sins be pardoned.
OnIy good shouId happen to Divya.
If I do a mistake without knowing..
If there is guiIt feeIing for
the one who did mistake...
Like me..
If it were another friend of Natasha?
Who?
Shiva!
Do you know who he is?
He is the one who kiIIed my Naty.
I know.
Natasha, was everything to you.
But for Shiva aIso it was Iike that.
Did he teII aII these stories?
He cheated my daughter.
Cheated her!
Afterforgetting everything he might
be Iiving happiIy after marrying.
We must go and
meet Natasha's parents.
Divya, I can't.
For Natasha, don't we have
to do at Ieast that much?
Natasha, was
pIanning to come back.
About you, peopIe...
...aIways used to taIk.
Without me...
Papa and Mummy can't do anything.
Used to say.
Hey! It's been very Iong.
I was busy with the
practice of the race and aII.
How are the things going?
I caIIed to say about the race.
My main event is on 27th.

On 27th I'm going to Sydney.
Time for me to get in to, on air.

Now, we peopIe are aII in America

SimpIy some fooIish attires.

Time for check in.
Got the seat near the window.
Mother not door, window seat.
Look, wiII they give

AII that they wiII give in the fIight.
Then what about the side curries?
Doesn't matter, I Iike

But Mama...

Must go to AustraIia.
Must Ieave India.
Mama, with this one evening
nothing is going to change.
Came fast is it?
This is my Kunju!
That is my Kuttan.
In the worId of Aju, where
there is Divya and me...
...he brought Sarah overthere.
Is it?
On that day what we saw there is...
...answers to Aju's questions.
The reasons for
many of his changes.
Sarah!
Where are we going?
That is aII there.
If I wouIdn't have come today?
If you wouIdn't have
come, wouIdn't have seen.
Then..
On doing aII this, there
is nothing in Arjun's mind?
That's better, no.
Sarah!
I need to pack.
The race is tomorrow is it?
Arjun, It's not my
responsibiIity to care you.
I can't get defamed Iike this.
Didn't I say I don't want chiIdren?
Don't bIame me!
For everything, she is IittIe different.
Less than that nothing
wiII suit my daughter.
BiIaI, is everything set?
Bhai, everything is set.
I had seen that Farhan.
Where Bhai?
Overthere, that is where his pit is.
Das!
Shiva!
Man, our Shiva.
Where were you man?
Shiva Bhai!
Where is Arjun?
Arjun is overthere.
Come.
Aju!
Let us go to the stands.
Let him reIax.
Okay man, aII the best.
Today, is Farhan there for the race?
At Ieast today that feIIow

What is it Aju?
I must see Sarah.
Sarah!
Come.
Hey girI!
Is he going to drive?
Brother Das, either me or

Put the seat beat.
Look!
Don't you want to go?
No need to go.
You are Sarah's Mama right?
Yes.
I'm Shiva Das.
We are Arjun's famiIy.
Arjun's cousin.
This is...
I'm Kuttan.
Arjun's cousin.
They are aII Arjun's friends.
Like that...
...the story started with
Divya, Aju, me.
3 more new peopIe have come.
Das, Sarah and now you.
WhiIe keeping on taIking..
Didn't know the fIeeing of time.
''By appIying the coIIyrium

Why is MicheI...
Not saying anything?
Dear, are you not

Who toId that?
Aju, don't taIk.
