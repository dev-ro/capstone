For us.
Sonia?
Are you alright?
She's gonna tell them.
The hospital is gonna call the police.
They're gonna believe her, not me.
Its too late...
Yes, I'm sure.
Tell them to call me as soon as possible.
No, I didn't spend them.
Sonia, do you hear me?
She changed her mind.
- No phone calls.
- I know.
One minute.
The nurse came in.
That's why she is in the hospital.
Now she changed her mind. It's not my fault.
I'm leaving.

Did she wake up?
- I want to give it to her.
- They want to talk to you.
- The mother filed a lawsuit.
- Against who? Did she wake up?
Take the kid.
Please.
- For revenge.
- Revenge? Why?
It's not mine.
- Aren't you the father?
- No.
- Then why you accepted it? 
- I don't know, no reason.
- You told her you sold it.
- It's fine.
- You didn't say it was stolen.
- It's the same.
When they rob you, you don't 
take money. You did.
- Did you show them to her?
- No.
- She says you did.

She wants me to go to prison
so she can get fucked freely.

- What do you want?
I've got a kid. A boy.

- Jimmy.
- Bring him this Saturday to see him. 
- Wait, I need a favour.
I had a fight with his mother.
I told the cops that the baby 
was with you today, alright.
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
I took the kid to some friends
and she called the police.
- Why don't you tell the truth? 
- I don't want to get them involved.
Alright.
- When was the baby here?
- This noon, 1 to 4.
Sonia?
Put him in the perambulator.
Put him in the perambulator.
Can you lend me your cell phone?
They stole mine.

I'm sorry.
Do you hear me?
Wait, Sonia!

- Get up! Let me go!
You gave me to the cops, we're even.
Wait!
I have changed. You'll see!
Don't lock, I won't try to get in.
- I love you.
- You're lying, as usual.
Do you have any money? I'm hungry.
Push them down the door. 
I'll return them.
Do you hear?
- Do you know Steve?
- The one with the earring?
He's inside.
Tell him Bruno is looking for him.
- Where have you been?

Hold tight.
Push.
Forget the bike.

They're coming.
What are we gonna do?

They're here.
They left.
Let's go.
Hold on to me.
Hold on to me.
Get up.
Get up!
- What's wrong?
- I can't move.
Give me your hand.
I can't stand it.
Your blood must get warm.
We got to go. They might return.
- Do you feel better?
- A little.
- Did you get warm?
- My foot, here.
Keep going. I'm gonna bring the motorbike.
Wait!
- You're going to leave with the money!
- I won't.
Damn it!
Yes?
Did they bring someone named
Steve here, about an hour ago?
Steve Lambion, 14 years old.
- Can I talk to him?
- Are you a relative?
- I have something to tell him.
- Say it to me.
- I have to see him.
- Wait, I have to ask.
Someone wants to talk to the young man.
- With the interrogator's presence.
- Alright.
You can talk.
I brought the motorbike. 
I parked it outside.
I did it.
- Are you the leader?
- Yes.
- Do you want a coffee?
- Yes.
Thanks.
- How's Jimmy?
- He's fine.
