Lida, you know, what is my most beloved 
poem of Yaroslav Smelyakova?
- What?
- Sit here and listen.
Along small cabins white 
acacia sweet flowers smell.
Good girl Lida 
In southern street lives.
In a windows glass being reflected 
As to world goes not hurrying ...
...And further forgot?
In windows glass being reflected 
As to world goes not hurrying ...
Good girl Lida...
- And why she is so good?
Ask about it the boy,
What in house opposite lives ,
He with this name lays down 
And with name this rises.
Not without reason on stone plates ,
Where the lovely boot went
"Good girl Lida"
In blue paint he wrote.
Can touch people boy's 
Little obstinate fervor.
So Pushkin's love should be...
So...
- What with you? - No, nothing.
On what I stopped? - On Pushkin.
Yes and... yes... Pushkin... there are miracles ,
There are forest wanders ...the 'rusalka'...
- Stop it, what marmaid, Sasha?
- On branches hangs ... Lays ...
In my opinion, you have studied too much
No, I have not studied too much. It's ...
Lida, I wish to set you one 
Serious question.
Is very important for me.
- Ok.
Just happened to you this: you come in a place like
this for the first time, and to you it seems ,
and it seems that you already were here, and 
all it's familiar to you: subjects, smells, sounds.
You have experienced this? - No, newer.
I always remember, where I was, when and with whom.
It seems I have such experience.
Here and now it seems to me that I was here 
already. - Are you well, Sasha ?!
Yes-yes, I saw everything already.
Now I shall draw aside this curtain ,
And find a crystal jug!
Was!
- Sasha! So you are a telepathist! Like Volf Messing!
- You think?
- Precisely! And let's try ...
- Let's.
You leave this room... I write 
on a paper a desire ...
And when you will return, I shall mentally order 
you to grant my desire ...
- Can we? - Let's do it.
'Look for the velvet mouse'
Enter!
- Did I got it? - Almost.
Then I shall try again?
Need more practice.
- Till tomorrow. - No, till the day after tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow I have examination. - Me too.
- I shall prepare tomorrow...
- Me too.
- Signifies the day after tomorrow, after examination?
- Yes, the day after tomorrow after examination ...
Operation 'Y'
Citizens new settlers! Implement culture :
Hang plastic 'coverages'.
Neither modernism, neither 
abstractionism ,
It preserves the walls from humidity ,
You - from rheumatism.
Don't go, scurry, buy painting.
I shall recommend, classic plot 
"Rusalka", as to the opera with the same name,
Music by Dargomyzhsky, words by Pushkin.
- Shame!
There is an entirely neutral plot ,
recommended even to usage
In children's establishments. It is please.
Oh, not that, will forgive, here is ...take it.
Give it to me.
Be short. It's a serious matter.
- Where is this pretended invalid?
- Do not bluster, I'm invalid.
- Here is what we have on today's day.
- Not we, just you.
- What can save us from the audit :
- Will forgive, not us, just you!
From the audit can save us only a robbery!
- With break-in or without?
- Well, naturally with break-in.
Article 89, location 2 - till six years old.
Will not go.
So, the robberies will not go.
- Nobody succeed it before us ...
- Nobody succeed it before us ...
These are real trifles. It's necessary to 
stage a robbery.
You must break the cashier, penetrate 
Into the store, and to leave all traces of a theft
Then gently vanish, having taken nothing.
All right that, realized, at last?
Do not be agitated, comrade director.
People will want to find who's the guilty party, that's all.
- This natural!
- It is legal!
- This new matter is not mastered by us.
- It is exact, not mastered.
Therefore, here is this measure...
Or, how better to say, .. .operation...
Y!
Operation "Y"!
Why "Y"?
- Why "Y"?
- In order to nobody sniff it.
Idiot!
All right, now back to the matter. To first of all it's necessary 
To neutralize the guard ...
- Not to us, but to you.
- This time it's namely you! - Yes? - Yes!
But what is exactly 'to neutralize'?
- Article 193, location 2. Till three years old.
Will not go. - No, will not go.
Neither ...
The guards love to be put asleep with chloroform
and that's done.
All the operation it's legal
- But a little as shallow hooliganism.
Yes, but take into account that for this shallow hooliganism 
I disburse large money.
I want an advance!
And this guard is strong?
In the operation night will serve as 
guard a grandmother - God help her.
- And she is  armed?
- Only with blank ammonition! Others questions exist?
- How much? - Three hundred!
- This is superficial! - No, will not go.
- You do not know us and we do not know you.
- I look stupid. - I shall earn more 
on 'rusalkas'. - Will not go, will not go.
- The dogs will went on laughters.
- I mean three hundred! - Stop it!
Your conditions?
- 330! - I  agree.
- Each! - I agree!
Good bye!
Stop, stop, stop. What you do?
Entire hour rehearsed.
To this effect I allowed the use of my 
own barn - and neither bray.
Here is how you should be in the proper form 
to approach the old lady
And to attract its attention is simple,
by the way. And you asked?
- What is the programe of the library?
- At 3 hour of night! Idiot!
- All right, and you? What should you do?
- Watch surroundings
And announce you when the militias shows up, 
or the old lay wakes up.
- But shall the old lady wake up? - No.
- So what are you talking about?
- Blockhead. - I agree.
And you?
You're cretin, you should not steal 
these bottles, but to break them.
- Break them? - Break them.
- Whole liter and half? - Whole.
- It's not a loss?
- Of course, it's a loss.
- Yes, but I insted of you ...
- But! But! But!
Let's set all as it was ,
we shall pass of other reasons.
I'm afraid - afraid - I'm afraid 
afraid for my nephew.
Little birds sleep and the fish also sleep ...
- Maria Ivanovna!
- Tss! What you! Lenka wake up.
I'm afraid - afraid - I'm afraid 
What's occured?
I bring you the rent 
for the apartment, for January.
- Thanks. Put it on the chest of drawers.
- It is quite well that you came.
- Why?
Nobody was here, and I could not talk to my director today 
to replace me on guard.
- Do not be worried, I shall take care of Lenochka.
- Thanks.
- And also I have to look at the sin dough that I'm cooking now.
- Ok, also,
But after dough cooking, go directly
on guard... - All right, then I move away.
Stand up, do not knock, wheels.
Conductor, press brakes.
I address to my natural mother 
With my last prayer
I like to see her with my own eyes.
- What time it is?
- You're what? A telephone clerk?
Slow in moves, without difficulty in work.
- Try it on him. - Ok.
Do not wait for me, mummy, your good son.
Your son is not as was yesterday.
I've sucked a dangerous bog
And my life - it's an eternal game.
- Can you tell me, how many 
degrees below zero today? - What-what?
- You what? - I'm training.
Then train yourself better ...
On cats.
- It's done, please.
Stand up, do not knock, wheels.
It's time to look the fate in eyes.
It's not so far too late 
To us to make halt.
Conductor, press brakes.
Wait to walk!
All right, it's about time! On work!
Nothing to do.
This is a nightmare.
Maria Ivanovna, I beg you ,
go home!
- Yes go, I'll take the guard for you.
- It is all right, I'm in a hurry.
Do not be worried, Maria Ivanovna ,
everything will be all right.
- In case of need, just whistle. - Aha.
- All right, I went.
Gandma'! Do you have a smoke?
- What?
- And where is the old lady? - I am for it.
- You? - Yes.
What with you?
Who's here?
- You who such? - The guard.
- And where is the old lay? - I am for it.
- And where is the exit?
- It is there ... Hands upwards!
- Who whistles? - I.
- And where is the old lady? - And you who?
- I'm from the Milita! And you? - The guard.
It's done, let's to bind it.
- Him?
A... Friend ...
Accursed thief of socialist 
property. You, blackguard!
Run, call the Militia,
and I will watch him.
- In case of need - you whistle.
- It is all right.
- And where is the phone?
- It's an automaton at the corner, 2 streets away.
- Get up, get up.
- Where I am?
Leave it, faster to the car, get up.
- What, you've done this?
- None else, do you have a piece of 2 kopeks?
Militia it's "02", without coin.
Take ... You shut up!
- Can you tell me, where is the toilet?
- Found! - Thanks.
Let's do it quick, now shall come the militia!
Hands upwards!
