EXCUSE ME.
I BELIEVE I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE PRINCIPAL.
NAME?
NAME?
RICHARD DADIER.
BUSINESS, PLEASE?
I'’VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
IT'’S ABOUT THE ENGLISH
TEACHER'’S JOB.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
NOT AT ALL.
[TYPEWRITING]
MR. DADIER, RICHARD.
GOOD LUCK.
IN CASE ANYTHING
TURNS UP--
WE'’LL CALLYOU,
MR. LEFKOWITZ.
MR., UH...DADIER?
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU.
WHAT COLLEGE
DID YOU ATTEND?
E
I BELIEVE
ON THE FORM,
ISN'’T IT, SIR?
BUT THAT WAS
AN ALL-GIRLS'’ SCHOOL.
YES, WELL, THEY TOOK IN
VETERANS AFTER THE WAR,
YOU SEE. I BELIEVE
THEY STILL DO.
SO MANY OF US
COMING BACK ALL AT ONCE,
IT WAS A LITTLE
DIFFICULT TO FIND
A SCHOOL OR A COLLEGE.
VETERAN, HMM?
YES, SIR. I WAS
IN THE NAVY, SIR.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
I WAS IN THE N--
YOU SPEAK VERY SOFTLY.
CAN YOU BE HEARD
AT THE BACK OF A CLASSROOM?
WELL, I...
I DID SOME DRAMATICS
AT COLLEGE, SIR,
AND THEY COULD
ALWAYS HEAR ME
IN THE VERY LAST
ROW.
REALLY?
SH-SHALL I PROJECT
A LITTLE, SIR?
GO AHEAD AND PROJECT.
UH...
'ONCE MORE
UNTO THE BREACH,
'DEAR FRIENDS,
ONCE MORE!
'OR CLOSE UP THE WALL
WITH OUR ENGLISH DEAD.
'IN PEACE, THERE'’S NOTHING
SO BECOMES A MAN...
'AS MODEST STILLNESS
AND HUMILITY,
BUT WHEN THE BLAST OF WAR
BLOWS IN OUR EARS...'
'THEN IMITATE THE ACTION
OF THE TIGER.'
VERY APTLY CHOSEN.
HENRY IV,
WASN'’T IT?
IT WASHENRY V,
I BELIEVE.
RIGHT.
GIVE YOUR CREDENTIALS
TO MISS BRADY
IN THE OUTER OFFICE.
YOU--YOU MEAN
I HAVE THE JOB?
CONGRATULATIONS.
OH, THANKS.
BETTER MEET SOME
OF THE OTHER TEACHERS
AND GET ACQUAINTED.
ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING
IN AN HOUR.
ANY QUESTIONS?
NO. NO, SIR.
JUST ONE QUESTION,
SIR.
THE DISCIPLINE
PROBLEM HERE--
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
WELL, I UNDERSTAND--
THERE IS NO DISCIPLINE
PROBLEM IN THIS SCHOOL,
MR. DADIER.
NOT AS LONG
AS I'’M PRINCIPAL.
I SEE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
MISS BRADY,
MY CREDENTIALS.
MR. EDWARDS, JOSHUA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOT AT ALL.
SHALL I--
ANYWAY,
HE SAYS TO ME,
'EXAGGERATION.
PURE EXAGGERATION.
'THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO DISCIPLINE
PROBLEM HERE.'
AND THERE'’S NO
DISCIPLINE PROBLEM
AT ALCATRAZ, EITHER.
YOU CAN'’T TEACH
A DISORDERLY MOB.
THAT'’S RIGHT.
YOU GOT TO HAVE DISCIPLINE,
AND THAT MEANS OBEDIENCE.
YEAH? HOW YOU
GONNA GET THAT?
WITH A RULER.
TAKE A RULER TO ONE
OF THESE DELINQUENTS,
HE'’LL BEAT YOU TO DEATH
WITH IT.
OH, MY NAME'’S MURDOCK.
NEW TEACHER?
ENGLISH.
RICHARD DADIER.
LOU SAVOLDI.
CARPENTRY.
GEORGE KATZ.
SOCIAL SCIENCE.
I'’M TAKING MONEY
UNDER THE FALSE PRETENSE
OF TEACHING HISTORY.
I THOUGHT YOU DEVELOPED
THEIR MUSCLES.
NO, DEVELOPING MY OWN.
GETTING IN SHAPE
TO DEFEND MYSELF
FOR THE FALL TERM.
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE A REFORM SCHOOL.
OH, FIRST
TEACHING JOB, EH?
THAT'’S RIGHT.
DON'’T LISTEN TO HIM,
DADIER. HE'’S A CYNIC.
WHY NOT? THIS IS
THE GARBAGE CAN
OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.
YOU TAKE MOST OF THESE SCHOOLS
AND PUT THEM TOGETHER,
AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
ONE BIG, FAT OVERFLOWING
GARBAGE CAN.
.
THINK OF TEACHING
THINK OF THOSE
20-YEAR JAIL SENTENCES.
GOT ANY TIPS
FOR A ROOKIE?
TWO.
DON'’T BE A HERO...
AND NEVER TURN
YOUR BACK ON THE CLASS.
MANNERS,
COME HERE.
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
TEACHING HERE?
OH, 12 YEARS.
2 PURPLE HEARTS
AND NO SALARY INCREASE.
THEY HIRE FOOLS LIKE US
WITH COLLEGE DEGREES
TO SIT ON THAT GARBAGE CAN,
KEEP '’EM IN SCHOOL,
SO WOMEN,
FOR A FEW HOURS A DAY,
CAN WALK AROUND THE CITY
WITHOUT GETTING ATTACKED.
Woman: REALLY?
I MEAN, THERE MUST BE SOME
STUDENTS WHO WANT TO LEARN.
YOU GONNA TEACH '’EM
IN THAT OUTFIT?
BECAUSE IF THOSE KIDS
EVER GET A LOOK AT--
HAVE YOU ARRANGED
WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD
TO ESCORT YOU
TO CLASS EVERY DAY?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.
YOUR PRINCIPAL,
MR. WARNEKE.
WELCOME.
WELCOME TO THE OLD FACES.
WELCOME
TO THE NEW FACES.
MISS PANUCCI.
SAY...
THESE KIDS, THEY CAN'’T
ALL BE BAD, CAN THEY?
NO? WHY?
MISS HAMMOND,
MR. WARNEKE.
[TRAIN PASSING]
MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD,
DOESN'’T IT?
IT'’S FUNNY. I DIDN'’T THINK
IT WOULD AFFECT ME THIS WAY.
AFTER ALL, IT'’S ONLY A JOB,
BUT WHEN I STEPPED
INTO MY OWN CLASSROOM,
IT WAS JUST LIKE
REACHING A GOAL.
I DON'’T BELIEVE
I GOT YOUR NAME.
OH, EDWARDS.
JOSH EDWARDS.
2 FIRST NAMES,
LIKE HARRY JAMES.
DO YOU LIKE SWING?
YEAH,
MOST OF IT.
I'’VE GOT
A REALLY FINE COLLECTION.
I CAN'’T REMEMBER
EVER BEING SO EXCITED.
IT'’LL PASS.
WAIT TILL MONDAY.
THE WAY SOME OF THE TEACHERS
WERE TALKING--
YOU DON'’T REALLY EXPECT
ANY TROUBLE, DO YOU?
I MEAN, I FIGURE YOU CAN
HANDLE ANY KID IF--
IF YOU CAN
HANDLE THEM.
HOW'’S THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WIFE
IN THE WHOLE
WORLD?
HOT, TIRED...
I DON'’T FEEL VERY MUCH
LIKE ANYTHING,
ESPECIALLY
NOT ATTRACTIVE.
I JUST FEEL
4 MONTHS PREGNANT.
BEAUTIFULLY PREGNANT.
CHAMPAGNE?
AND RAVIOLI!
THAT'’S NOT ALL.
OH, YOU GOT THE JOB!
OH, DARLING!
CONGRATULATIONS, PROFESSOR.
YOU WANT SOME CHEESE?
OH, CHAMPAGNE
AND RAVIOLI.
NOW, THAT'’S NO WAY
TO FEED AN UNBORN CHILD.
WELL, CHAMPAGNE,
THAT'’S FOR THE MOTHER.
THAT'’S FOR LUCK.
I'’VE HAD LUCK FROM THE VERY
FIRST MOMENT WE MET, ANNE.
WHAT?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
WHAT'’S THE MATTER,
DEAR?
NOTHING.
NOW, LOOK, HONEY.
IT'’S ALL GONNA BE
OVER REAL SOON.
OH, NO, NO.
IT'’S NOT THAT.
IT'’S JUST THAT...
I DON'’T WANT TO LET YOU DOWN
AGAIN, THAT'’S ALL.
YOU'’VE NEVER
LET ME DOWN. EVER.
I DON'’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THE LAST TIME.
.
NOW, LOOK.
A LOT OF WOMEN
LOSE BABIES.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
IT WAS ONLY 2 MONTHS.
I KNOW. I CAN'’T HELP
THINKING ABOUT IT.
I JUST DON'’T WANT
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN.
NOTHING'’S
GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT'’S GONNA BE
71/2 POUNDS IN WEIGHT,
IT'’S GONNA HAVE YOU
R LOOKS AND MY BRAINS,
AND IT'’S GONNA SUPPORT
US IN OUR OLD AGE.
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING, DARLING, IS
YOU MUSTN'’T WORRY.
PLEASE, NO BAD
MEMORIES, HUH?
NO GUILTY FEELINGS,
PLEASE.
PLEASE, ANNE.
AND YOU DON'’T MIND
MY BEING THIS WAY?
HOW COULD I MIND?
I'’M RESPONSIBLE,
AREN'’T I?
HERE.
TO THE THREE OF US.
TO THE THREE OF US.
[CAR TIRES SCREECH,
JAZZ MUSIC BLARES]
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
CRAZY KIDS,
THAT'’S WHAT HAPPENED.
[CHAOTIC CLAMOR]
HEY, YOU OWE ME

NOT YET.
GOOD MORNING.
HOW DO YOU DO?
DO I LOOK ALL RIGHT?
RAVISHING.
I'’M REALLY VERY NERVOUS.
DO YOU THINK
THEY'’LL LIKE ME?
THEY MAY EVEN
FIGHT OVER YOU.
HI! I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'’T COMING!
TESTING!
TESTING!
1, 2, 3, 4.
1, 2, 3, 4.
HEY, LOOKIT! HE KNOWS

SURE, MAN. HE GRADUATED...
...[WHISTLES]...
...[WHISTLING, CHEERING]
SHUT UP!
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'’S ENOUGH
STUPID NONSENSE.
NEXT GUY OPENS HIS TRAP
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS.
WHO'’S THAT?
I THINK HE TEACHES
PUBLIC SPEAKING
OR SOMETHING.
I DON'’T KNOW.
BY THIS TIME, YOU ALREADY
SAID HELLO TO EVERYBODY,
SO CUT THE YAKKETY, AND
WE'’LL GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.
FIRST, IN THE NAME OF YOUR
PRINCIPAL, MR. WARNEKE,
I WANT TO WELCOME YOU BACK
TO NORTH MANUAL.
AW!
AW!
NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
WE'’LL HAVE THE TEACHERS
CALL OUT THE ROLLS
OF THEIR OFFICIAL CLASSES.
WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR NAME
CALLED OUT, YOU FALL OUT.
AND THE FIRST GUY GIVES TROUBLE
GETS TROUBLE RIGHT BACK.
WE START WITH THE SENIORS.
AND '’CAUSE WE'’RE GENTLEMEN
, THE LADIES COME FIRST.
WE GOT A NEW TEACHER HERE.
SHE'’S GONNA TAKE CARE

SO YOU WON'’T

NO, NO. YOU DON'’T

I'’LL REMEMBER,

OR MAYBE YOU'’D

OFFICE
RIGHT NOW WITH ME.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
YOU'’RE HOLDIN'’

YOU WANT TO TAKE ME

BRIGHT BOY.
HEY, WAIT.
HE MEANS ME.
HEY, HEY! DE LICA,
HOW ARE YOU?
ALL RIGHT,

WE'’LL ARRANGE
PERMANENT SEATING LATER.
YOU WANT TO CLOSE
THE DOOR FOR ME THERE?
HEY, HOW ABOUT
THAT MISS HAMMOND?
ALL RIGHT, LET'’S
BREAK IT UP BACK THERE.
HEAR WHAT I SAID?
I SAID, BREAK IT UP!
WHY?
WHAT'’D YOU SAY?
I SAID, 'WHY?'
SIT DOWN.
THE FIRST THING
WE'’RE GONNA DO
IS PASS
THESE CARDS OUT.
TAKE ONE,
PASS THE REST BACK.
THE NUMBER OF
THIS CLASS IS 55.
THE NUMBER OF THE
CLASSROOM IS 206.
MY NAME IS SPELLED
D-A-D-I-E-R.
NOW, THAT'’S
PRONOUNCED 'DA DI--'
WHOEVER THREW THAT,
YOU'’LL NEVER PITCH
FOR THE YANKS, BOY.
HEY, ARTIE, HOW DO YOU LIKE
MR. DADDY-O?
DADDY-O!
DADDY-O!
DADDY-O!
DADDY-O!
YOU ALL FINISHED?
FINE.
GLAD YOU GOT THAT
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.
THE NAME IS DADIER.
MR. DADIER.
PRONUNCIATION IS A VERY
IMPORTANT PART OF ENGLISH.
I'’D HATE TO FAIL ANYBODY WH
O COULDN'’T PRONOUNCE MY NAME.
ME, TOO, TEACH.
MR. DADIER. SAY IT.
AND TAKE YOUR HAT OFF
IN THIS CLASSROOM.
YOU EVER TRY TO FIGHT 35 GUYS
AT ONE TIME, TEACH?
TAKE YOUR HAT
OFF, BOY,
BEFORE I
KNOCK IT OFF.
NOW, THE SUBJECT
YOU'’RE GONNA LEARN
IN THIS CLASS IS
ENGLISH.
SOME OF YOU MAY WONDER
IF ENGLISH CAN HELP YOU
GET A JOB
AS A CARPENTER,
A MECHANIC,
OR AN ELECTRICIAN.
THE ANSWER IS YES.
IN FACT, IT MAY EVEN
SURPRISE YOU
TO FIND ENGLISH IS
YOUR FAVORITE SUBJECT.
I'’D BE SURPRISED,
ALL RIGHT.
THERE'’LL BE NO
CALLING OUT NOW.
IF YOU'’VE GOT ANY
QUESTIONS TO ASK,
JUST RAISE YOUR HAND.
YOU HEAR THAT, MILLER?
SURE, TEACH.
YOU COMIN'’ IN
STRONG.
I CAN'’T
TUNE YOU OUT.
HIS NAME
AIN'’T TEACH!
IT'’S DADDY-O.
DON'’T YOU KNOW
HIS NAME, JERK?
EXCUSE ME,
MR. JERK.
ALL RIGHT, WEST, SINCE
YOU'’RE SO COOPERATIVE,
SUPPOSE YOU STAY AFTER CLASS
AND HELP ME OUT.
I'’M BUSY.
OH, GO ON, ARTIE.
HELP HIM OUT.
THEN YOU CAN BE
TOGETHER ALONE.
OH, DADDY-O!
[WOLF WHISTLES]
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
WE HAD A FEW LAUGHS.
IN A MINUTE, THE BELL'’S
GONNA RING OUT THERE.
THAT MEANS YOU GO
TO YOUR CIVICS CLASS.
TOMORROW MORNING, WHEN YOU

HEY, TEACH, YOU'’RE
COMING BACK HERE TOMORROW?
SURE, I'’M COMING BACK.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?
'’CAUSE I'’LL MISS YOU,
WEST.
OOOOH!
ALL RIGHT.
LET'’S KNOCK IT OFF.
NOW, COME ON, HUH?
THAT'’S ENOUGH, HUH?
WHAT'’S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
?
YOU, SANTINI,
ME?
YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU
GRINNING FOR?
HE'’S
THE GRINNINGEST CAT
IN THIS WHOLE
SCHOOL.
HE SMILES
ALL THE TIME.
THAT'’S '’CAUSE
HE'’S AN IDIOT-BOY.
WELL, JUST TRY
AND PAY ATTENTION, SANTINI.
I PAY ATTENTION.
[BELL RINGS]
HEY, MILLER!
COME HERE. I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU A MINUTE, MILLER.
MAN-TO-MAN TALK,
HUH, MILLER?
YOU KNOW, I'’VE BEEN
LOOKING UP THE RECORDS,
AND YOU'’RE
A NATURAL BORN LEADER.
REALLY?
YEAH, YOU ARE.
THOSE GUYS OUT THERE,
THEY LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW, DON'’T BE MODEST
WITH ME, MILLER.
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'’RE
A LITTLE BRIGHTER,
A LITTLE SMARTER THAN
THE REST OF THOSE GUYS.
ME?
YEAH.
AND EVERY CLASS
NEEDS A LEADER.
YOU COULD BE
THAT LEADER, MILLER.
WHAT YOU DO,
THEY'’LL DO.
YOU COOPERATE, AND
THEY'’LL FOLLOW YOU.
HOW ABOUT IT,
MILLER?
I DON'’T KNOW.
BUT I DO KNOW,
MILLER.
HOW ABOUT IT?
SURE,
IF YOU THINK SO.
THAT'’S A BOY.
GOOD. THAT'’S
FINE, MILLER.
OH, UH,
IS THIS YOURS?
YEAH.
TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
SURE, MAN.
[DING]
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
WHY, HELLO.
MISS HAMMOND.
OH, HOW DID IT
GO TODAY?
YOU MEAN AFTER MY DISASTER
THIS MORNING?
MY ENTIRE CLASS VOLUNTEERED
TO STAY AFTER SCHOOL
AND POUND ERASERS
OR SOMETHING.
GOT A RIDE HOME?
I HAVE A PRIVATE
LIMOUSINE.
OH?
CITY BUS.
MY WAY'’S MORE PRIVATE.
I'’LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.
WELL, I HAVE TO
CHECK OUT FIRST.
OH, THAT'’S ALL RIGHT.
I'’LL MEET YOU DOWNSTAIRS.
THEY DON'’T EVEN KNOW
THEIR MULTIPLICATION TABLES.
OF COURSE NOT. ALL THEY
CAN MULTIPLY IS THEMSELVES.
WELL, HOW ARE THEY
EVER GRADUATED?
GRADUATED?
GOING DOWN?
NO. GOING UP.
GRADUATED?! THEY
JUST GET TO BE 18.
THEN THEY'’RE THROWN OUT
TO MAKE ROOM
FOR MORE
OF THE SAME KIND.
[THUMP]
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
YOU COCKROACH!
WHAT HAPPENED?
NOTHING.
HUH?
NOTHING.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHY, IT'’S THE FIRST DAY
OF SCHOOL, TEACHER.
THE WAY SHE SCREAMED,
THE WAY SHE LOOKED--
SCARED. MAN,
I MEAN, REAL SCARED.
I THOUGHT, 'THIS COULD
BE HAPPENING TO ANNE.'
AND THEN I HIT HIM.
MAYBE SHE
PROVOKED THE BOY.
WHAT?
WELL, TEACHERS
OUGHT NOT TO DRESS SEXY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SEXY?
SHE HAD ON,
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT,
ONE OF THESE
SPORT OUTFITS,
BUTTONED
RIGHT UP TO HERE.
I'’LL BET.
WITH BLACK NET
STOCKINGS, TOO.
NO, THEY WERE
FLESH-COLORED.
I SEE.
RICK?
YEAH?
IS SHE BEAUTIFUL?
WHO?
MISS HAMMOND,
THAT'’S WHO,
MISS DESIRABLE
HAMMOND.
OH, YEAH,
I'’D SAY THAT IN A--
WELL, KIND OF
A FLASHY WAY, SHE'’S--
YEAH, I'’D SAY SHE'’S...
SHE'’S ATTRACTIVE.
WHAT WAS I WEARING
WHEN YOU CAME HOME TONIGHT?
WHAT WERE YOU
WEARING? HMM.
YOU NEVER NOTICED,
DID YOU?
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME THINK.
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING?
YOU WERE WEARING--
LET'’S SEE.
YOU HAD ON THAT BLUE
OUTFIT, DIDN'’T YOU?
NO! IT WAS A BL--
A PINK--THE PINK DRESS
WITH THE BLUE RIBBON.
YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE
RIBBON YOU WEAR UP HERE?
AND YOU HAD ON
A LITTLE APRON.
YOU DIDN'’T TAKE
YOUR IRON TABLETS.
YES, I TOOK
MY IRON TABLETS.
YOU DIDN'’T THINK
I WAS VERY SEXY.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IRRESISTIBLE.
PROVE IT.
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR CALCIUM TABLETS?
MORE, PLEASE.
DID YOU TAKE THEM?
HMM?
DON'’T BE SO MEDICAL.
LOOK, WHAT WAS SHE
WEARING?
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING?
WHAT'’S ALL THIS ABOUT--
WHAT WASIWEARING
WHEN I CAME HOME?
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS
AND HOLD ME.
WHAT WAS I WEARING?
YOU REMEMBER?
YOU DON'’T REMEMBER,
DO YOU?
YOUR BROWN SUIT.
NO, IT WASN'’T
THE BROWN SUIT.
YOUR GRAY SUIT.
NO.
STRIPED NECKTIE?
MM-MMM.
NO?
YOU DON'’T REMEMBER,
DO YOU?
NOW DOES THAT PROVE
THAT YOU DON'’T LOVE ME?
JUST PROVES
I'’M SILLY, JEALOUS,
AND LOVE YOU
TOO MUCH.
AW, HE LOOKED
TERRIBLE.
MUST'’VE HIT HIM
FROM BEHIND.
I DON'’T KNOW. TEACH
MUST HAVE SOME WALLOP.
NAH. HE HIT HIM
WITH BRASS KNUCKLES.
THAT'’S RIGHT.
I SEEN '’EM.
HE CARRIES '’EM
IN THAT LITTLE
OL'’ BAG OF HIS.
4 TRANSFUSIONS
JOEY HAD TO HAVE.
HIS NOSE
WAS BUSTED, TOO.
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, ARTIE?
MAN, THEY SAY
HE SLUGGED JOE SO HARD
HE KNOCKED
ALL HIS FRONT TEETH OUT.
WHAT DID THE TEACH
HIT HIM WITH?
AIN'’T YOU HEARD?
THE TEACH WAS
MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMP
OF THE NAVY.
HEY, GEORGE!
MORNING, MILLER.
NOW TODAY WE'’RE
GOING TO PINPOINT
SOME OF YOUR FAULTS
IN GRAMMAR.
I'’VE WRITTEN SEVERAL
SENTENCES ON THE BOARD.
I WANT YOU TO READ
THOSE SENTENCES
USING THE PROPER WORD.
NOW, DOES EVERYBODY
UNDERSTAND THAT?
.
YOU'’RE VERY QUIET TODAY
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, LET'’S GET STARTED.
DON'’T BE AFRAID
TO MAKE MISTAKES.
BECAUSE, AFTER ALL,
THAT'’S HOW YOU LEARN--
BY MAKING MISTAKES.
ALL RIGHT, MILLER,
WILL YOU TAKE THE FIRST ONE?
'HENRY HASN'’T WRITTEN
NO ANSWER TO MY LETTER.'
NO, MILLER,
IT SHOULD BE...
'HENRY HASN'’T WRITTEN
ANYANSWER TO MY LETTER.'
DE LICA, SECOND ONE.
'IF I WERE HIM,
I WOULDN'’T SAY THAT.'
NO, IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'’T SAY THAT EITHER.
IT SHOULD BE
'IF I WEREHE.'
ALL RIGHT, WEST,
THE THIRD ONE.
'I THROWED
THE BALL FAST.'
ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
WEST.
YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN THAT.
THIS IS THIRD TERM
STUFF.
YOU HAD THAT
2 YEARS AGO.
'WON'’T ANYONE
BORROW YOU A PEN?'
'THE CLASS CHOOSE HIM
AS PRESIDENT.'
'WHERE WAS YOU
WHEN IT HAPPENED?'
WELL...
WE DIDN'’T DO VERY WELL
WITH THIS, DID WE?
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK A LITTLE HOMEWORK
WILL STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT.
HOMEWORK?!
YES, HOMEWORK.
YOU CAN START COPYING
ALL 35 OF THESE SENTENCES
IN YOUR NOTEBOOKS
RIGHT NOW.
I GOTTA GO TO WORK
AFTER SCHOOL, TEACH!
THIS HOMEWORK
WILL COUNT AS A TEST.
IT MIGHT DECIDE WHETHER YOU
PASS OR FAIL THIS COURSE.
MILLER?
THIS...
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA,
WASN'’T IT?
WHAT IDEA IS THAT?
THIS SILENT TREATMENT,
PICKING THE WRONG
ANSWERS DELIBERATELY.
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'’RE
THE LEADER, FINE.
BUT YOU'’RE LEADING THEM
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.
WHY?
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS, CHIEF.
AIN'’T MANY GUYS LIKE
WHAT HAPPENED TO JOE MURRAY.
HE GOIN'’ TO JAIL,
YOU KNOW THAT?
I SEE. THAT'’S WHY YOU
SET THE CLASS AGAINST ME?
THEY DON'’T NEED
NO EXCUSE
OR ME TO HELP '’EM.
WHAT ABOUT THAT TALK
WE HAD, MILLER?
SUPPOSE WE
JUST FORGET ABOUT
THAT LITTLE SNOW JOB,
MR. DADIER.
HI. I WANTED
TO THANK YOU.
IT'’S ALL RIGHT.
WOULD YOU MIND WALKING
OUT TO THE CAR WITH ME?
WITH THOSE KIDS OUT THERE
AND ALL, I...
NO.
IF IT'’S TOO MUCH
TROUBLE FOR YOU--
NO, NOT AT ALL.
THANKS.
I HOPE I HAVEN'’T HINDERED
YOU WITH YOUR CLASSES.
HOW'’D YOU MAKE OUT
TODAY?
OH, THE BOYS
WERE VERY QUIET.
GUESS I KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE THINKING.
HELLO, JOSH.
HI.
HOW ABOUT A DRINK?
YEAH. FINE.
LET'’S GO
OVER THERE.
[STAN KENTON RECORD
PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
I GOTTA--
I GOTTA GET HOME.
OH, THIS IS
THE LAST ONE.
FOR THE ROAD.
FOR THE ROAD.
ROAD.
OH.
MMM.
STAN THE MAN.
HMM?
TERRIFIC STUFF.
VERY EDUCATED GENTLEMAN.
YEAH.
JUST LIKE OUR STUDENTS.
EVERYTHING ALWAYS COMES
BACK TO OUR STUDENTS.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
HMM?
I AM DISAPPOINTED,
VERY DISAPPOINTED.
HMM.
LISTEN. LISTEN
TO THIS PASSAGE.
MIND THOSE TRUMPETS.
GO, MAN.
OH, BARTENDER?
I WONDER IF
THERE ARE MANY ALCOHOLICS
AMONG
HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS.
.
IT'’S NOT FAIR, RICK
HMM?
I WANT TO TEACH.
I REALLY
WANT TO TEACH.
SO WHY DON'’T
THEY LET ME TEACH?
ANY MAN WHO REALLY
WANTS TO TEACH
SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO TEACH.
TO TEACH. I KNOW.
DID I TELL YOU?
WHAT?
I'’M BRINGING
MY RECORD COLLECTION IN
AND PLAYING IT
FOR THE CLASS.
YEAH.
YEAH, WHAT?
[SLURRING]
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT?
YOU TOLD ME YOU'’RE
BRINGING YOUR RECORD--
LET ME ASK--
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
SUPPOSE THEY DON'’T
LIKE IT, THE RECORDS?
WHY NOT?
IT TOOK ME 15 YEARS TO
COLLECT THOSE RECORDS.
HALF THOSE RECORDS
CAN'’T EVEN BE REPLACED.
BESIDES, MUSIC IS
BASED ON MATHEMATICS,
AM I RIGHT?
YEAH. YEAH.
WHAT DO I TEACH?
MATHEMATICS.
YOU'’RE RIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY.
TO TEACHING.
[CLINK]
TO TEACHING.
I GOTTA
GET HOME FAST.
MY--MY WIFE'’S PREGNANT,
YOU KNOW.
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS!
HEY, LET'’S TAKE
A CUT THROUGH HERE.
SHORTCUT
TO THE BUS, HUH?
ALL RIGHT.
YES, SIR, IT'’S THE BEST
PROFESSION ANYWHERE.
KIDS.
YEP.
BEST PROFESSION
ANYWHERE.
SO WHY DON'’T THEY
LET ME TEACH?
I DON'’T KNOW. I GUESS JUST
'’CAUSE THEY'’RE BAD GUYS.
THEY'’RE NOT BAD,
THEY'’RE JUST IGNORANT.
BADANDIGNORANT.
YOU DON'’T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU?
NO, I--
I DON'’T REALLY
MEAN IT, JOSH, I--
I DON'’T
REALLY MEAN IT.
[THUMP]
JOSH.
HMM?
THAT'’S FUNNY.
WHAT? WHAT'’S FUNNY?
FOOTSTEPS. YOU HEAR
THOSE FOOTSTEPS?
HEY, DADDY-O!
I DON'’T WANT YOU TO FORGET
JOE MURRAY, TEACH!
[SIRENS]
OH, JOSH.
JOSH.
[GROAN]...
...[TELEPHONE RINGS]...
...[RING]
HELLO?
MR. DADIER THERE?
UH, NO. NO, NO,
HE ISN'’T HERE RIGHT NOW.
WHO IS THIS?
[CLICK]
HELLO?
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.
WELL, RICK--
THE LIGHTS.
RICK!
YOU MUSTN'’T BE SCARED.
I'’M OK.
WELL, I'’LL
CALL A DOCTOR.
NO, NO.
I'’LL BE ALL RIGHT.
JUST DON'’T LOOK AT ME,
ANNE, PLEASE.
NO, PLEASE,
YOU MUSTN'’T.
A THING LIKE THIS
COULD--
I DON'’T WANT YOU
TO LOSE THE BABY, ANNE.
OH.
YOU'’RE
NEVER GOING BACK
TO THAT
SCHOOL AGAIN.
NEVER!
OH, YES, I AM.
YEAH, I'’VE BEEN BEATEN UP,
BUT I'’M NOT BEATEN.
THERE'’S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
I'’M NOT BEATEN,
AND I'’M NOT QUITTING.
WHAT'’S THE ANSWER,
PROFESSOR?
NOW, I'’M GOING BACK
TO THE SCHOOL TOMORROW.
ANNE DOESN'’T
WANT ME TO GO,
AND I--
MAYBE SHE'’S RIGHT.
IS IT HOPELESS?
IS THERE NO WAY TO GET
THROUGH TO THOSE KIDS?
IS THERE NO WAY
TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND?
YOU'’LL FIND A WAY.
WELL, WHAT IF I DON'’T?
WHAT THEN?
WHAT'’S THE POINT
OF TEACHING
IF KIDS DON'’T CARE
ABOUT AN EDUCATION?
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE
ABOUT IT. THEY DON'’T.
YOU'’RE WRONG.
YOU'’RE THE BLIND MAN
WHO VISITS AN ELEPHANT.
HE FEELS A TAIL
AND HE SAYS,
'AH. AN ELEPHANT
MUST BE LIKE A SNAKE.'
COME.
PORTO, TO CARRY.
PORTO, PORTAS, PORTAT,
PORTAMUS, PORTATUS, PORTANT.
?...BURSTING IN AIR?
? GAVE PROOF
THROUGH THE NIGHT?
? THAT OUR FLAG
WAS STILL THERE?
? OH, SAY DOES THAT
STAR-SPANGLED BANNER YET WAVE?
? O'’ER THE LAND
OF THE FREE?
? AND THE HOME
OF THE BRAVE?
ANY TEACHER COULD GET THROUGH
TO STUDENTS LIKE THESE.
THE KIND OF STUDENTS I HAVE--
WHY BOTHER WITH THEM?
IN THIS COUNTRY, ALL
CHILDREN ARE ENTITLED
TO AN EDUCATION.
I'’M NOT PREPARED FOR MY JOB.
YOU WERE MY PROFESSOR
IN COLLEGE.
YOU SHOULD'’VE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO STOP A FIGHT
IN A CLASSROOM,
HOW TO DEAL WITH
AN I.Q. OF 66,
HOW TO QUIET A CLASS
OF SCREAMING WILD ANIMALS.
NO, WHY BOTHER ABOUT THEM?
THEY'’LL SURVIVE WITHOUT ME.
BUT WHO WANTS WILD
ANIMALS IN THE STREET?
IF I'’M GONNA BE
A LION TAMER,
I SHOULD TEACH
WITH A CHAIR AND A WHIP.
YES, WE AT THE UNIVERSITY
WERE TO BLAME.
WE DID NOT PREPARE
THE TEACHERS
TO TEACH CERTAIN CHILDREN
OF THIS GENERATION.
TELL ME, RICHARD, WHY DO
YOU WANT TO BE A TEACHER?
JUST TO EARN A LIVING?
NO.
BECAUSE IT'’S EASIER PERHAPS
THAN SOME OTHER JOB?
EASIER?
PERHAPS
YOU'’RE DEDICATED?
NO, HARDLY.
NO, I WANT TO TEACH.
MOST OF US WANT
TO DO SOMETHING CREATIVE.
I CAN'’T BE A PAINTER
OR A WRITER OR AN ENGINEER,
BUT I THOUGHT IF I COULD
HELP TO SHAPE YOUNG MINDS--
SORT OF SCULPT LIVES--
THEN BY TEACHING,
I'’D BE CREATING.
FOR EVERY SCHOOL
LIKE YOURS,
THERE ARE HUNDREDS
LIKE THIS ONE.
WE COULD USE YOU,
BUT YOUR SCHOOL
NEEDS YOU.
YOU STILL WANT TO TEACH
HERE IN THIS SCHOOL?
[SIGHS]
I THINK I'’LL TAKE
ANOTHER CRACK
AT MY JUNGLE.
THE REPORT SAYS
YOU COULDN'’T IDENTIFY
ANY OF THE BOYS.
IT WAS DARK.
I TOLD YOU,
IT WAS DARK.
I COULDN'’T SEE
ANYTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU PROTECTING--
THE GOOD NAME
OF THIS SCHOOL,
YOUR JOB, WHAT?
SOMEBODY HAVE TO GET
KICKED TO DEATH
BEFORE YOU'’LL COOPERATE?
IT WASN'’T
THAT SERIOUS.
YOU COULDN'’T MAKE CLASS
FOR A WEEK.
I'’D SAY THAT WAS SERIOUS.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO?
PRESS CHARGES.
I'’LL FIND THE ONES
WHO DID IT.
I'’LL GO OVER EVERY KID
IN THIS SCHOOL.
YES, AND YOU'’LL DO
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.
MR. DADIER,
I'’VE HANDLED LOTS OF
PROBLEM KIDS IN MY TIME,
KIDS FROM BOTH SIDES
OF THE TRACKS.
THEY WERE 5 OR 6 YEARS OLD
IN THE LAST WAR.
FATHER IN THE ARMY,
MOTHER IN A DEFENSE PLANT,
NO HOME LIFE,
NO CHURCH LIFE,
NO PLACE TO GO.
THEY FORM STREET GANGS.
IT'’S WAY OVER MY HEAD,
MR. DADIER.
MAYBE THE KIDS TODAY ARE
LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD--
MIXED UP, SUSPICIOUS,
SCARED.
I DON'’T KNOW.
BUT I DO KNOW THIS--
GANG LEADERS HAVE TAKEN
THE PLACE OF PARENTS,
AND IF YOU DON'’T
STOP THEM--
CLASS IS STARTING.
DO YOU MIND?
THEN YOU WON'’T HELP US?
I'’M SORRY.
.
SURE. AND I HOPE
THANKS ANYWAY.
FOR WHAT? TYING OUR HANDS
SO IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN?
AND DON'’T WORRY.
IT WILL.
WELCOME BACK, CHIEF.
YOU BRING YOUR COSMETICS
TO SCHOOL, CHIEF?
DON'’T GET TOUCHY,
CHIEF.
I KNOW LOTS OF GUYS
USE MAKEUP.
WELL...
AT LEAST
THE SILENT TREATMENT
SEEMS TO HAVE ENDED.
[BUZZING]
NEW MACHINE SHOP,
CHIEF.
SINCE WHEN?
INSTALLED HER
LAST WEEK.
DOES THIS--
DOES THIS GO ON
ALL THE TIME?
MOST ANYTIME.
OH, NO.
THAT'’S GREAT.
THAT'’S ALL WE NEEDED.
THIS IS A--
A TAPE RECORDER.
WAS WE GONNA MAKE
RECORDS, TEACH?
THAT'’S RIGHT.
WELL,
GO, MAN, GO!
[LOUDLY] NOW,
WE ALL TALK TOO MUCH,
BUT NOBODY LIST--...
...[BUZZING STOPS]...
...[LAUGHTER]
NO-NOBODY LISTENS.
AND, UH, WELL, I THOUGHT
THAT PERHAPS IF WE TALK
INTO THIS MACHINE
AND THEN WE LISTEN--
OHH, IT'’S A SPEECH PERIOD.
'HOW I SPENT
MY SUMMER VACATION.'
THIS OUGHT TO BE
REAL JAZZY.
NO, NO SPEECHES--...
...[BUZZING]
IF THERE WAS ONE THING
I DIDN'’T LIKE
WHEN I WENT
TO HIGH SCHOOL--
TEACH, TEACH, DID YOU
GO TO HIGH SCHOOL?
CAN'’T YOU SEE, MAN?
HE AIN'’T NEVER GOT OUT.
WELL, SINCE YOU WANT
TO TALK SO VERY BADLY,
I GUESS I'’M NOT GONNA
HAVE MUCH TROUBLE
GETTING YOU TO TALK
INTO THIS MACHINE.
WHAT KIND OF TALK?
SNAPPY STORIES?
MILLER...
HOW'’D YOU LIKE TO BRING
YOUR MOTHER TO SCHOOL?
HOW'’D YOU LIKE
TO BRING YOURS?
HEY, MORALES
GOT A SISTER.
MAYBE HE'’D LIKE
TO BRING HER.
COME ON WITH
THOSE RECORDS, MAN!
? DA-DA DA-DA
DA-DAH?
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE ALL--
WE ALL SING A LITTLE,
HUH? COME ON.
THE LAST ROSE
OF SUMMER.
HEY, TEACH, YOU GOT
THAT RECORDER GOING?
QUIET!
ALL RIGHT, NOW.
WHO'’S GONNA BE THE FIRS
T TO TRY THIS OUT, HUH?
Miller: HOW ABOUT MORALES?
HEY, WHAT'’S THE MATTER
WITH MORALES?
MORALES,
HE LOVES TO TALK.
NO. TOMITA, SUPPOSE
YOU STEP UP HERE AND TRY IT.
YOU AGAINST MORALES...
'’CAUSE HE DON'’T
TALK GOOD ENGLISH?
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.
HEY, MORALES,
COME ON,
GET UP THERE. I
WANNA HEAR YOU TALK.
COME ON. COME ON.
AW, COME ON,
CHICKEN.
WE WANT MORALES!
WE WANT MORALES!
HEY, CHICKEN!
WE WANT MORALES!
[CLUCKING]
I NO CHICKEN!
[BUZZING]
ALL RIGHT.
START TALKING.
WHAT AM I GONNA
TALK ABOUT?
TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.
HOW YOU GOT UP THIS MORNING,
TOOK THE BUS TO SCHOOL.
WELL--
GO AHEAD.
I GOT UP AT 7:30,
GO WASH,
BUT MY STINKIN'’ SISTER,
SHE'’S IN THE BATHROOM
SO I CAN'’T GET IN.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'’S FINE, BOY.
JUST KEEP TALKING.
SO THEN I GO
TO THE STINKIN'’ BATHROOM,
I WASH MY STINKIN'’ FACE,
THEN I EAT
SOME STINKIN'’ SAUSAGES.
HEY, LOUDER.
COME ON.
WE CAN'’T HEAR YOU
IN THE BALCONY.
THEN I GO DOWN
THE STINKIN'’ STREET,
WITH MY STINKIN'’ BOOKS,
THEN I MEET THE STINK-FACE
WHO LIVES NEAR ME.
AND HE SAYS,
'YOU GO TO SCHOOL, PETE?'
SO I SAYS,
'YOU STINKIN'’ RIGHT.'
SO WE WALK TO
THE STINKIN'’ EL,
AND WE WAIT
FOR THE STINKIN'’ TRAIN,
AND WHADDYA THINK?
THE STINKIN'’ TRAIN
IS LATE.
SO I GOTTA GET INTO
A STINKIN'’ CROWD.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THAT'’S WHY I'’M STINKIN
'’ LATE TO SCHOOL, TEACH.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW WAS I? OK?
YOU SURE STUNK UP
THAT RECORD, BOY!
[APPLAUSE]
MORE! MORE!
[WHISTLING]
THAT'’LL BE ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.
AREN'’T YOU
GONNA PLAY IT BACK?
NO.
THANKS FOR
PICKING MORALES.
I'’M SURE
YOU'’RE HIS FRIENDS.
SURE ENOUGH,
CHIEF.
TOO BAD YOU
CAN'’T SAY THE SAME.
NOW JUST
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
MORALES IS A SPIC,
THAT'’S WHAT IT MEANS.
MAYBE--I DON'’T KNOW--
MAYBE YOU DON'’T LIKE SPICS.
THAT'’LL BE ENOUGH
OF THAT, WEST.
WHAT DID I DO,
ANYHOW?
ALL RIGHT,
SIT DOWN...SPIC.
YEAH.
AT LEAST
I'’M NO IRISH MICK!
I SAID
THAT'’D BE ENOUGH!
PICK UP THAT MAGAZINE,
BELAZI.
PICK IT UP.
I WANT TO GET ONE THING
VERY CLEAR
IN THIS CLASSROOM.
THERE'’S NOT GONNA BE
ANY NAME-CALLING HERE,
NOT TODAY, NOT TOMORROW,
NOT EVER!
NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
ALL OF YOU?
I WAS JUST KIDDING.
YEAH, I KNOW.
'JUST KIDDING.'
THAT'’S HOW THINGS START,
JUST KIDDING.
LIKE A STREET FIGHT.
SOMEBODY PUSHES SOMEBODY,
SOMEBODY PUSHES BACK.
PRETTY SOON, YOU'’VE GOT
A STREET FIGHT WITH NO KIDDING.
THAT'’S THE SAME WAY
WITH NAME-CALLING.
ALL RIGHT, WEST, LOOK.
YOU'’RE OF IRISH DESCENT,
ALL RIGHT?
SO IS MURPHY OVER THERE.
YOU CALL HIM A MICK,
HE CALLS YOU A MICK.
BUT SUPPOSE MILLER HERE
CALLS YOU A MICK.
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
NO. THEN YOU CALL HIM
A NIGGER.
I WAS JUST KIDDING.
WELL, STOP KIDDING!
SURE, COME ON, COME ON.
TELL ME ALL ABOUT
YOUR STINKIN'’ SISTER.
[BELL RINGS]
YOU GONNA PLAY MORALES'’
RECORD BACK, CHIEF?
[BUZZING]...
...[TELEPHONE RINGS]
MR. WARNEKE
WANTED TO SEE ME?
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
BUT, MR. WARNEKE--
THERE ARE NO BUTS,
MURDOCK--
NONE THAT CAN FORGIVE
SLAPPING A STUDENT.
IF YOU CAN'’T CONTROL
YOURSELF...
YES, SIR,
I UNDERSTAND.
Warneke: DADIER?
HE'’S ROUGH TODAY.
SIT DOWN, DADIER.
PROBLEMS...
NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS,
EH, DADIER?
WELL, NOT THE SAME
THAT YOU HAVE, SIR.
IF IT ISN'’T ONE THING,
IT'’S ANOTHER--
BRUTALITY, STUPIDITY,
BIGOTRY.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
THAT SOME TEACHERS
ARE GUILTY
OF RACIAL PREJUDICE
IN THEIR CLASSES,
IN THIS SCHOOL?
I--I WOULDN'’T
KNOW, SIR.
IT COMES OUT UNDER
PRESSURE, I SUPPOSE.
YEAH,
I SUPPOSE SO.
IF YOU KNEW
OF SUCH A TEACHER,
WOULD YOU TELL ME
ABOUT IT?
I DON'’T KNOW.
YOU DON'’T KNOW?
WHY NOT?
I DON'’T KNOW. THIS IDEA
OF CARRYING TALES--
YOU HAVE SOMEONE PARTICULAR
IN MIND, MR. WARNEKE?
WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
ARE YOU FROM?
[TRAIN PASSING]
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT NEGROES, DADIER?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HOW
DO I FEEL ABOUT THEM?
DO YOU CONSIDER THEM
INFERIOR?
YOU MEAN AS A RACE?
ANY WAY.
NO, I DON'’T CONSIDE
R THEM INFERIOR.
WHAT ABOUT SPICS?
SPICS?
SPICS.
DO YOU LIKE THEM?
WELL, IT DEPENDS
ON THE INDIVIDUAL.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
DADIER?
THERE ARE PUERTO RICANS
I LIKE,
THERE ARE PUERTO RICANS
I DON'’T LIKE.
I SEE. WHAT ABOUT
IRISH MICKS?
LOOK, MR. WARNEKE, I DON'’T
KNOW WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
IF THERE'’S SOME TEACHER
WHO'’S TEACHING--
I'’M TALKING ABOUT YOU,
DADIER.
YOU'’RE THE TEACHER WHO'’S
SUPPOSED TO BE THE BIGOT.
WHAT?
IT'’S REPORTED
THAT YOU'’VE MALIGNED
RELIGIOUS AND RACIAL GROUPS
IN YOUR CLASSROOM.
THAT'’S WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT, DADIER.
THAT'’S A LIE.
IS IT?
DID YOU USE THE EXPRESSION
'NIGGER' IN YOUR CLASS?
YES.
THEN IT IS TRUE.
NOW JUST
WAIT A MINUTE--
DID YOU USE
THE EXPRESSION 'SPIC'?
YES. I USED IT
IN THE SAME LESSON--
LESSON?
YES!
WHAT TEXTBOOK
DID YOU GET THIS FROM?
JUST LISTEN TO ME
A MINUTE, NOW.
YOU LISTEN! I DON'’T CARE
IF A BOY'’S SKIN
IS BLACK, YELLOW, OR PURPLE!
HE GETS THE SAME TEACHING,
THE SAME BREAKS
AS ANY WHITE BOY.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
DO YOU?
THERE'’S ENOUGH IMMORALITY
IN THE WORLD
WITHOUT YOUR ADDING TO IT.
ENOUGH HATRED,
ENOUGH BLIND STUPIDITY--
HOLD IT!
WILL YOU
JUST HOLD IT?
I USED
THAT EXPRESSION
TO TEACH A LESSON
IN DEMOCRACY--
WHAT SHOULDNOT
BE SAID.
THOSE WERE
NEGATIVE EXAMPLES.
NOT ACCORDING TO MY REPORT.
THIS BOY HAS ACCUSED YOU--
WHAT BOY?
A BOY IN YOUR CLASS.
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
I CAN'’T TELL YOU THAT.
WELL, SUPPOSE
HE'’S LYING.
DON'’T I HAVE ANY RIGHT
TO FACE MY ACCUSER?
DON'’T I HAVE
ANY RIGHTS AT ALL?
I KNOW I DON'’T HAVE ANY
AS A TEACHER LEFT,
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHTS
AS A HUMAN BEING?
NOBODY'’S DEPRIVING YOU
OF ANY RIGHTS.
YOU ACCUSED ME.
YOU CONDEMNED ME
WITHOUT EVEN A HEARING!
LOOK, I'’M SORRY,
DADIER.
I MAY HAVE BEEN HASTY.
IF I'’M WRONG,
I APOLOGIZE.
YOU WERE WRONG.
IN THAT CASE...
DADIER?
I RECALL THAT YOU HAD SOME
DRAMATIC TRAINING IN COLLEGE.
WILL YOU TAKE CHARGE
OF OUR CHRISTMAS SHOW?
WELL...
IS THIS A PENALTY?
THIS A REWARD?
WHAT IT IS?
JUST AN EXTRA JOB.
ALL RIGHT.
MILLER?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
DOING?
YEAH.
I'’M JUST GOIN'’ DOWN TO
THE MACHINE SHOP, CHIEF.
THIS LATE AFTER SCHOOL?
DOING A LITTLE HOMEWORK
ON THIS CARBURETOR.
WHAT KEPT YOU
AFTER SCHOOL, CHIEF?
YOU DOING YOUR HOMEWORK
HERE, TOO?
MILLER.
YOU WENT TO SEE MR. WARNEKE
TODAY, DIDN'’T YOU?
DID I?
YES, YOU WENT TO SEE
MR. WARNEKE,
AND YOU TOLD HIM
A LOT OF LIES,
A LOT OF DELIBERATE LIES.
YOU TWISTED
EVERYTHING I SAID.
THERE WAS NO RACIAL ISSUE
TILL YOU MADE ONE!
WAIT A MINUTE,
MILLER.
WHAT IS IT,
CHIEF?
WHAT IS WHAT?
WHY YOU GOT
THE KNIFE OUT FOR ME?
WHY I'’VE GOT THE KNIFE
OUT FOR YOU?
OH, MAN,
THERE'’S A REAL SWITCH.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE
YOU CAUSED, AFTER ALL YOU DONE,
AFTER THE WAY YOU FOULED UP
THAT RECORDING SESSION,
AFTER THE WAY
YOU AND WEST--
STEADY NOW.
JUST A MINUTE.
THE WAY ME AND WEST
DID WHAT?
GANGED UP ON ME,
THAT'’S WHAT.
YOU DON'’T MEAN
THAT, CHIEF.
I DO MEAN IT.
BOY, YOU REALLY
GOT IT BAD.
YOU DENY IT?
WELL, DO YOU
DENY IT?
YOU GONNA HIT ME?
I'’D REALLY LIKE THAT.
THAT'’S ALL YOU NEED,
BOY!
THAT'’LL REALLY
WASH YOU UP AROUND HERE.
COME ON,
START SWINGING.
COME ON.
YOU GO AHEAD.
COME ON.
WHY, YOU BLACK--
GO AHEAD
AND SAY IT.
YOU SAY IT, NOW.
YOU GO AHEAD
AND HIT ME!
I'’M SORRY.
I'’M SORRY WHAT
I JUST SAID, MILLER.
THERE'’S NO EXCUSE.
I JUST LOST MY HEAD.
I'’M SORRY.
YEAH.
MILLER...
...[VOICE SINGING
IN DISTANCE]
THE TRUCK WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.
YOU READY, LOUIE?
NOW COME ON!
YOU JUST PAY ATTENTION
WHEN I'’M TALKING
TO YOU, STUPID!
WE'’VE BEEN OVER IT
50 TIMES.
I SLUG THE GUY,
AND PEE WEE
TAKES THE WHEEL.
WHAT'’S SO SPECIAL?
LOOK, YOU JUST STAY
WITH HIM
IN CASE HE NEEDS YOU.
THAT'’S WHAT'’S
SO SPECIAL.
LOOK, YOU DRIVE TO--
DRIVE TO THE PARK,
DUMP THE PAPERS,
THEN GET RID
OF THE TRUCK.
WHEN THE GUY SELLS
THE PAPERS,
WE MEET RIGHT BACK HERE
AND WE DIVVY UP.
NOW, YOU GOT THAT?
YOU SURE YOU GOT IT NOW?
DON'’T WORRY ABOUT IT.
GO AHEAD, BLOW. MOVE.
WELL, HOW'’S THE TEACHING
BUSINESS COMIN'’ ALONG?
[TRUCK HORN HONKS]
HEY, WHAT'’S THE CHANCE
OF GETTIN'’ A JOB
DRIVING A TRUCK LIKE THIS?
[TRUCK STARTS]...
...[TRUCK DRIVES AWAY]
EASY, TEACH. EASY.
YOU COULD'’VE GOT HURT
OVER THERE JUST NOW.
WHAT HAPPENED,
ANYWAY?
WHERE'’D YOU COME FROM?
I WAS JUST STROLLIN'’
DOWN THE STREET,
AND I SAW SOME GUY WHO
THREW A BOTTLE RIGHT AT YA.
AND I FIGURED THEY'’RE OUT
TO GET YOU LIKE LAST TIME.
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD'’VE BEEN
MAYBE SHOT OR SOMETHIN'’.
YEAH. OR SOMETHING.
THAT BELAZI
WITH THOSE KIDS?
BELAZI? YOU MEAN
FROM OUR CLASS?
THAT'’S RIGHT. WEARING
THE SAME KIND OF JACKET.
THEY'’RE ALL WEARING THE SAM
E KIND OF JACKET YOU ARE.
YOU'’RE MEMBERS OF THE SAME
GANG, AREN'’T YOU?
NO, IT'’S A CLUB, TEACH.
IT'’S A CLUB I BELONG TO,
AND I DIDN'’T SEE ANY BELAZI.
OH, YOU DIDN'’T SEE
THOSE KIDS STEAL
THAT NEWSPAPER TRUCK
THERE, EITHER, DID YOU?
.
THAT'’S RIGHT.
JUST LIKE I SAID.
I WAS JUST STROLLIN'’ BY.
I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I
LIE TO YOU?
YOU KNOW, I DON'’T--
I DON'’T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
YOU KNOW WHAT'’LL HAPPEN
WHEN THOSE KIDS ARE CAUGHT?
WHAT'’S THAT, TEACH?
REFORM SCHOOL,
YEAR IN JAIL--MAYBE MORE.
OH. YOU KNOW,
A YEAR FROM NOW,
THE ARMY COMES BY,
AND THEY SAY,
'OK, ARTIE WEST,
YOU GET INTO UNIFORM,
'AND YOU BE A SOLDIER,
AND YOU SAVE THE WORLD,
AND YOU GET YOUR LOUSY
HEAD BLOWED RIGHT OFF.'
OR MAYBE--MAYBE
I GET A YEAR IN JAIL,
AND MAYBE
WHEN I COME OUT,
THE ARMY, THEY DON'’T
WANT ARTIE WEST
TO BE A SOLDIER NO MORE.
MAYBE WHAT I GET IS--
IS OUT.
I SEE.
DO YA, TEACH?
DO YA?
WELL, WEST,
YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.
COME ON,
GET '’EM OFF!
LOOK, YOU'’RE
IN MY CLASSROOM NOW,
AND WHAT
I COULD TEACH YOU...
THE FIRST LESSON
IS DON'’T BUTT IN.
JUST DON'’T.
OR--OR YOU COULD
FLUNK OUT FOR GOOD.
[TRAIN PASSING]...
...[PHONOGRAPH PLAYING
EARLY SWING MUSIC]
HEY, WHAT YOU
GOT THERE, TEACH?
OH, IT'’S MUSIC.
ISN'’T THAT MUSIC YOU
HAD ON THERE, TEACH?
FOR THE NEXT CLASS.
OH, WHAT'’S THE MATTER
WITH THIS CLASS?
HOW'’S THE DISK
JOCKEY?
LOOK AT YOUR RECORDS.
NOW JUST KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF THE RECORDS.
BEG YOUR PARDON.
COME ON, TEACH!
WILL YA PLAY SOMETHIN'’?
NO, OUR JOSH, HE'’S

RIGHT, JOSH?
YOU SEE,
MUSIC IS BASED
ON MATHEMATICS, AND...
IT'’S JUST THAT THE NEXT CLASS
IS A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED.
WE'’RE ADVANCED, TEACH.
2 TIMES 2 IS 4.
ARE4.
BESIDES,
HAVEN'’T YOU HEARD
MUSIC IS SOOTHING
TO THE SAVAGE BEAST?
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE--TAKE YOUR SEATS.
WE'’RE JUST CRAZY

HEY, CLAP HANDS,

[JITTERBUG TUNE PLAYS]
BLUE MOON.
WAIT TILL MILLER HEARS
ABOUT THIS JAM SESSION.
WHERE'’S THAT MILLER MAN
TODAY, ANYWAY?
HE'’S CUTTIN'’ CLASS TODAY.
WHEN THERE'’S ACTION,
HE CUTS.
FUNNY. I WAS
SOMEPLACE ELSE, TOO.
NOBODY WAS HERE
TODAY.
[NEEDLE SCRAPING]
THEY BROKE MY RECORDS.
I DON'’T UNDERSTAND,
RICK.
I JUST DON'’T UNDERSTAND.
[BANG]
NOW, THE BROKEN RECORDS
CAN NEVER BE REPLACED.
THE PHONOGRAPH
COST ABOUT $40.
I DON'’T KNOW
WHICH OF YOU DID IT,
BUT I KNOW THAT NONE OF YOU
TRIED TO STOP IT.
SO, WHENEVER YOU CAN,
YOU JUST PUT YOUR NICKELS
AND YOUR DIMES IN THIS TIN CAN.
CAN YOU DEDUCT IT
FROM TAXES?
BUT HOW DID WARNEKE
DISCIPLINE THE KIDS?
A MASTERFUL STROKE.
HEH.
HE TAUGHT
THOSE LITTLE MONGOLIANS
A LESSON
THEY'’LL NEVER FORGET.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID?
HE GOT '’EM ALL
IN THE AUDITORIUM,
AND HE HAD '’EM...
HE HAD '’EM WRITE
500 TIMES,
'I RESPECT
PRIVATE PROPERTY.'
DID ANYBODY
EVER PAY EDWARDS
FOR THOSE
BROKEN RECORDS?
HOW ABOUT IT,
DADIER?
IS THAT TIN CAN
FULL OF MONEY YET?
HE'’S LUCKY IF THEY DON'
’T STEAL THE TIN CAN.
TELL YA WHAT
I'’M GONNA DO.
I'’M GONNA RIG UP
AN ELECTRIC CHAIR
AND BRING IT TO
MY CARPENTRY CLASS.
I'’LL TELL MY PUPILS
IT'’S A CIRCUIT TESTER.
THEN I'’LL LEAD
THE LITTLE LICE
INTO THE CHAIR
ONE BY ONE.
[SNAP] THROW
THE SWITCH ON '’EM.
THAT'’S FINE,
EXCEPT THOSE KIDS'’LL
RIG UP THAT HOT SEAT FIRST,
THROW YOU INTO IT,
AND FRY YOU TO DEATH.
I'’D HAVE
CLOBBERED THEM.
WOULD YA?
SURE.
WOULD YA?
THEY OUTNUMBER YOU,
THEY OUTWEIGH YOU,
AND THEY OUTREACH YOU.
BESIDES, THEY GET
CLOBBERED AT HOME
AND IN THE STREETS.
THEY'’RE USED TO IT.
THAT'’S WHY THEY
UNDERSTAND IT.
WHAT'’S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH TEACHING?
I NEVER HAVE ANY TROUBLE,
NOT REAL TROUBLE.
THAT'’S RIGHT,
MISS PANUCCI.
HE'’S A CLOBBERER.
YOU'’RE A SLOBBERER.
'I'’M JUST A NICE WOMAN
TRYING TO DO MY JOB.
NOW, PLEASE BE NICE,
BOYS.'
YOU GIVE THEM
THE VETERAN PITCH.
'I GOT THE PURPLE
HEART, BOYS.'
OH! OR YOU TELL '’EM
ABOUT--WHAT IS IT?
THAT STEEL PLATE
IN YOUR HEAD
OR THAT ARTIFICIAL LEG.
YOU BEG FOR SYMPATHY.
'LOOK, I'’M A VETERAN,
FELLAS.
WILL YA HELP ME
KEEP MY JOB?'
BUT DO YOU CARE IF
THEY LEARN ANYTHING? NO!
THIS GUY'’S LUCKY
THEY DON'’T KICK
THAT ARTIFICIAL LEG OUT
FROM UNDERNEATH HIM.
AND YOU--
YOU'’RE A SLUMBERER.
YOU SLEEPWALK.
HEAR NO EVIL,
SEE NO EVIL,
SPEAK NO EVIL.
OH, I MEAN,
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
YOU MAKE SOUNDS
LIKE A--LIKE A TEACHER.
NOBODY CARES.
NOBODY LISTENS.
I MEAN NOBODY CARES.
ESPECIALLY YOU.
THIS MAN HERE,
HE'’S A GRUMBLER.
YOU HATE THE KIDS.
YOU HAVE CONTEMPT
FOR THEM.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT
ABOUT YOU, ZOLA?
I'’M--I'’M A FUMBLER.
I'’M NOT DOING ANY BETTER
THAN THE REST OF YOU.
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?
START BUTTING OUR HEADS
AGAINST A STONE WALL
WITH A LOT OF KIDS
THAT DON'’T WANT TO LEAR
N IN THE FIRST PLACE?
YES.
ALL RIGHT. HOW?
I DON'’T KNOW HOW.
I MEAN, THERE MUST BE
SOME WAY TO...
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY
TO REACH THEM.
WHOM ARE YOU
TRYING TO CONVINCE,
ME OR YOU?
[BELL RINGS]
ROTTEN DAY,
AIN'’T IT?
OH, HELLO,
MRS. BROPHY.
YOU SHOULDN'’T BE
WALKING IN THE SNOW.
I LIKE IT.
IF I HAD A CONDITION,
I'’D MAKE THEM CARRY ME
LIKE A CHINESE PAGODA.
WHERE'’D YOU GO,
THE MOVIES?
IT'’S FUNNY,
THE HABITS YOU GET INTO.
EVERY MORNING, AS SOON
AS MY HUSBAND GOES TO WORK,
I TURN ON THE RADIO,
NOTHING BUT SERIALS,
IN ONE EAR
AND OUT THE OTHER.
BUT ONE DAY,
THE RADIO BREAKS DOWN.
OH, IS IT QUIET!
I THOUGHT I'’D GO CRAZY,
STARK-NAKED CRAZY.
YOUR HUSBAND
AIN'’T HOME YET.
I, UH, STOPPED IN
JUST NOW.
I WANTED A LITTLE RUM
FOR COOKING, YOU KNOW.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
OH, LET ME SEE.
IT'’S A LITTLE BIT
AFTER 5:00.
I DON'’T CARE
FOR LIQUOR, PERSONALLY,
BUT MY OLD MAN, HE--
HE JUST GOES FOR IT
IN A GREAT WAY.
YOU SHOULDN'’T BE WALKING
IN THE SNOW, MRS. DADIER.
ANNE?
ANNE?
I THOUGHT
IT WAS YOU.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
NO, NO.
NO. IT WAS LATE.
YOU WEREN'’T HOME.
I GOT LONELY.
SORRY I WAS LATE.
WHAT'’S
A TEACHER DO
WHEN HE STAYS
AFTER SCHOOL?
OR IS IT ETHICAL
TO TELL?
JOSH EDWARDS
QUIT HIS JOB TODAY.
I JUST HELPED HIM
STRAIGHTEN HIS DESK OUT.
I TRIED TO GET HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND, BUT--
HE WAS RIGHT TO QUIT.
AND IF YOU
HAD ANY SENSE,
YOU'’D GET OUT
OF THIS PLACE, TOO,
BE--BEFORE
IT'’S TOO LATE.
WHAT WOULD I DO?
SELL SHOELACES?
RUN FOR PRESIDENT?
YOU'’D TEACH
IN A DECENT PLACE
WHERE KIDS
WANT TO LEARN,
WHERE A TEACHER'’S
RESPECTED.
I WROTE TO
PROFESSOR KRAAL.
HERE'’S HIS ANSWER.
HE SAYS HE CAN GET YOU
A JOB IN HIS SCHOOL.
TELL HIM YES, RICK.
MAYBE.
WE'’LL SEE.
WHAT'’S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT THIS PLACE?
IT'’S A CHALLENGE.
WHAT ELSE IS IT?
YOU WANT TO STAY.
YOU WANT TO STAY
IN THIS FILTHY,
MISERABLE--
WAIT A MINUTE.
COME ON NOW. HOLD IT.
YOU'’VE GOT ENOUGH TROUBLES
WITHOUT ME, YOU KNOW.
HAVE I TOLD YOU TODAY
THAT I LOVE YOU?
DO YOU?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I'’M SELFISH.
I WANT TO BE TOLD.
LET'’S SPLURGE
AND TAKE A TAXI HOME.
WE'’LL NECK
IN THE BACK SEAT.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
ALL RIGHT.
TAXI!
? WERE YOU THERE?
? WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED?
? MY LORD??
? WHEN ISRAEL
WAS IN EGYPT LAND?
? LET MY PEOPLE GO?
? OPPRESSED SO HARD
THEY COULD NOT STAND?
? LET MY PEOPLE GO?
? GO DOWN, MOSES?
? WAY DOWN IN EGYPT LAND?
NO, MAN.
THIS AIN'’T
NO JAM SESSION.
STOP JAZZING
IT UP, OK?
ALL RIGHT,
LET'’S PICK IT UP
AT 'GO DOWN, MOSES.'
? GO DOWN, MOSES?
? WAY DOWN IN EGYPT LAND?
? TELL OLD PHARAOH?
? LET MY PEOPLE GO?
SOUNDED REAL--
REAL NICE.
FAIR, CHIEF.
IT'’LL
GET BETTER.
CUT OUT,
FELLAS.
I'’LL SEE YO
U LATER.
IF YOU'’RE WONDERIN'’
ABOUT THIS,
WE DIDN'’T BREAK IN.
MR. HALLORAN LOANED US
THE USE OF THE HALL.
NO, NO. I--
[PLAYS PIANO]
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF, UH...
MAYBE WE'’D PLAY A SPOT
ON YOUR CHRISTMAS SHOW?
YEAH.
I FIGURED.
WOULD YOU?
THAT'’S WHY WE'’VE BEEN
REHEARSING, MR. DADIER.
WHERE'’D YOU LEARN TO
PLAY THE PIANO THIS WAY?
OH, PICKED IT UP.
WHAT ARE THE RULES,
MILLER?
RULES?
YEAH,
WHAT ARE THE RULES?
I MEAN, YOU CAN
BE SO COOPERATIVE
ON A THING
LIKE THIS.
IN MY CLASSROOM,
I--I--
YOU BETTER GET
A MOVE ON, TEACH.
YOU'’LL BE LATE
FOR YOUR OWN CLASS.
WANT TO WALK UP
WITH ME?
I'’LL BE ALONG.
YEAH.
HELP!
FASTER! FASTER!
WHA--HEY!
OH, HO!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[CRASH]
JACK RAN FOR THE BEANSTALK.
THE GIANT
WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[THUMP]
HA HA HA!
SO JACK GOT RICH,
AND WHEN HE GREW UP,
HE MARRIED A PRINCESS,
AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY
FOREVER AFTER.
[FANFARE PLAYS]...
...[WHISTLING]
MORE! MORE!
HEY, TEACH, HOW ABOUT
THE MAIN FEATURE?
MARILYN MONROE, EH?
HUMPHREY BOGART!
WELL, WHAT DID YOU
THINK OF THE STORY?
IT WAS LOUSY.
THERE WAS NO DAMES.
MILLER, WHAT
DID YOU THINK?
WELL, THIS JACK,
HE'’S A PRETTY COOL CAT,
ALL RIGHT.
I DON'’T LIKE
FAIRY STORIES, YA KNOW?
SPERANZA?
OH, I DON'’T KNOW.
I KINDA FELT SORRY
FOR THE GIANT.
OH, WHY'’S THAT?
WELL, THIS JACK,
HE AIN'’T NO HERO.
HE'’S A PRETTY DUMB HICK.
YEAH, LOOK,
HIS OLD LADY SENDS HIM
OUT TO SELL THE COW.
WELL, JACK THE JERK
MEETS UP WITH A CON MAN
AND HE LET HIM HAVE THE COW
FOR A COUPLE OF CRAZY BEANS.
YEAH. THAT WASN'’T SO SMART!
AND THEN HE CLIMBED
THAT OLD BEANSTALK
UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED
IN ANOTHER LAND.
WITHOUT
A SPACE HELMET, MAN?
HOW DID THAT GIANT
GET UP THERE
WITHOUT ANY BEANSTALK?
THIS IS A FAIRY STORY.
HE JUST FLEW.
I GOT THIS JACK
PEGGED FOR A THIEF.
OH? WELL,
THE GIANT WAS SUPPOSED
TO KILL JACK'’S FATHER
AND STEAL HIS MONEY.
HOW'’D JACK
KNOW THAT?
SUPPOSE JACKTHOUGHT
THAT THE GIANT STOLE
FROM HIM?
DID THAT GIVE JACK
THE RIGHT
TO STEAL THE HEN THAT
LAID THE GOLDEN EGG?
NO. HE'’S GOTTA HAVE PROOF.
SUPPOSE HE
HAD THE PROOF.
WHAT THEN?
JACK--HE SHOULDA
CALLED THE COPS.
YEAH, AND THE COPS
WOULD HAVE KEPT THE LOOT
FOR THEMSELVES, TOO.
THAT'’S RIGHT.
COULD BE.
NOT THE FBI.
[WHISTLING, APPLAUSE]
AND THAT MAGIC HARP, HMM?
IF THE GIANT
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO BAD,
THE HARP WOULD HAVE
WANTED TO BE SNATCHED.
COULD BE.
NOW, WHY
DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT HARP LIKED
THAT GIANT SO MUCH?
I KNOW.
YOU DO?
'’CAUSE THE GIANT,
HE LIKED MUSIC.
THAT JACK
WAS A REAL HEIST MAN.
HE GOT AWAY WITH
BURGLARY 3 TIMES.
I LIKED THE PART
WHERE HE KNOCKED OFF
THE GIANT.
AH, WHO CARES?
THE WHOLE THING
HERE'’S A PHONY!
WILSON,
DO YOU THINK JACK
SHOULD HAVE KILLED
THE GIANT?
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.
HE WAS CHASIN'’ HIM.
IF SOMEBODY STOLE FROM YOU,
WOULDN'’T YOU CHASE THEM?
THE WAY I GOT IT FIGURED,
THIS JACK, HE'’S A SQUARE.
FIRST OFF, HE DON'’T CARE
IF HIS OLD LADY
STARVES TO DEATH.
ON THE BUTTON, MAN.
DIDN'’T HE SELL THE COW
FOR A HANDFUL OF BEANS?
THEN HE TURNED
BURGLAR.
AND THEN
HE COMMIT MURDER.
AND FOR ALL OF THIS,
HE GETS A REWARD.
HE'’S RICH.
AND HE MARRIES
A PRINCESS.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE HE TOOK
WHAT HE WANTED.
BECAUSE CRIME
ALWAYS PAYS.
IT WAS A CRIME,
WASN'’T IT?
SO WHAT?
YEAH, IT WAS ONLY SOME
STINKIN'’ GIANT ANYWAY.
WHY DON'’T YOU
LIKE THE GIANT?
BECAUSE
HE'’S A GIANT?
YOU DON'’T LIKE DODGERS
FANS, IS THAT RIGHT?
NO, KIDDING, FELLAS. I MEAN,
YOU DON'’T LIKE THE GIANT
BECAUSE HE'’S DIFFERENT
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
THAT'’S RIGHT.
BUT IS THAT RIGHT?
I MEAN, IS IT RIGHT
TO DISLIKE SOMEBODY
JUST BECAUSE
HE'’S DIFFERENT?
I MEAN,
THERE'’S A LOT OF US
RIGHT HERE
IN THIS CLASSROOM
WHO ARE DIFFERENT
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
YEAH, BUT IF
THE STORY'’S SO COCKEYED,
THEN WHAT'’S
THE POINT OF IT?
NOW WE'’RE
GETTING SOMEWHERE.
NOW, ALL YOUR LIVES,
WHAT SOME GUY
TELLS YOU,
WHAT YOU SEE IN BOOKS,
IN MAGAZINES,
ON THE TELEVISION
AND RADIO,
WHAT YOU READ
IN THE NEWSPAPERS.
BUT IF YOU CAN
JUST EXAMINE THE STORY,
LOOK FOR THE REAL MEANING,
AND, MOST OF ALL, FELLAS,
AND IF YOU'’LL JUST LEARN
TO THINK FOR YOURSELVES--
HERE IT COMES!
HERE COMES
THE COMMERCIAL!
[LAUGHTER]
[BELL RINGS]
THAT GIANT,
IF HE DONE WRONG,
AT LEAST I THINK
HE SHOULD
HAVE HAD A TRIAL.
HEY, TEACH, HOW ABOUT SOME
MORE STORIES LIKE THAT?
YEAH, A STORY
ABOUT FOOTBALL.
HEY, TEACH
MAYBE I'’LL TURN OUT
TO BE A CRITIC
ON THE MOVIES.
HOW DID YOU LIKE THAT
JACK IN THE BEANSTALK?
HE TURNED OUT TO BE A THIEF
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
I LIKED THE STORY.
SO YOU FINALLY
GOT THROUGH TO THEM.
I THINK SO.
YES, FOR ONCE,
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
WELL, WHAT'’S THE ANSWER--
VISUAL EDUCATION?
YEAH, PARTLY. I MEAN,
IF YOU CAN JUST
GET THEM STIMULATED.
SURE, THEY'’LL
GO FOR MOVIES,
BUT WILL THAT
TEACH THEM TO READ?
BUT IF YOU CAN GET THEM
TO USE THEIR IMAGINATION,
GET THEM TO REACH OUT
FOR SOMETHING.
BUT CERTAINLY
NOT KNOWLEDGE.
YEAH, BUT IF THEY'’D USE
THEIR INTELLIGENCE,
GET THEIR MINDS OUT
OF COMIC BOOKS.
MINDS? A MIND WOULD
INDICATE A BRAIN,
AND A BRAIN--
BEFORE HE PROVES
DARWIN WAS RIGHT,
I'’VE GOT A CLASS.
OH, UH, LOOK,
IF YOU STILL NEED
A SANTA CLAUS
FOR YOUR
CHRISTMAS SHOW--
YEAH, I DO.
WELL, YOU'’VE GOT ONE.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]...
...[RING]
HELLO.
YOUR HUSBAND WON'’T
BE HOME TODAY.
HE'’S GONNA
BE WITH HER.
WHO IS THIS?
HELLO?
HELLO?
[CLICK]
MOVE IN A LITTLE BIT,
FELLAS,
JUST A LITTLE CLOSER
TOGETHER.
NOW, WILL YOU HIT THEM
WITH THE SPOT HERE?
WAIT. I CAN'’T SEE.
TURN
THE FOOTLIGHTS OUT.
THAT'’S IT.
NOW, RAISE IT UP.
I JUST WANT TO
CATCH THEIR FACES.
UP--THAT'’S IT.
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
REMEMBER
THAT EFFECT, HUH?
GOT IT.
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS.
LET'’S SEE THAT
WORK LIGHT HERE,
WOULD YA?
MILLER,
STICK AROUND
A MINUTE, WILL YA?
I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU
ABOUT AN ENCORE.
OH...
I'’M GONNA GO.
OH, I'’M BUSHED.
THANKS FOR STAYING.
IT'’S SHAPING UP
OK, HUH?
HEY, ISN'’T IT ALWAYS QUIET
BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE?
GOOD NIGHT,
BEFORE HE
HAS '’EM BURNING
THE SCHOOL DOWN.
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT--
GOOD NIGHT.
WELL, COULD I
BE WRONG?
HAVE YOU GOT
THESE WILD ANIMALS
TRAINED?
NO, NOT TRAINED.
JUST INTERESTED.
DON'’T FORGET
YOUR HISTORY.
NEVER TURN
YOUR BACK.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
YOU COMING?
I HAVE A LITTLE
MORE WORK TO DO.
UH-HUH.
NEED ME FOR ANYTHING
ELSE, MR. DIRECTOR?
NO, THANKS.
THAT'’S TOO BAD.
THE COSTUMES
ARE FINE, LOIS--
I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.
THAT'’S WHY
IT'’S TOO BAD.
LOOK, LOIS.
YOU'’RE TIRED.
NO, NOT TIRED.
JUST BORED.
JUST GOOD AND BORED.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I
SHOULDN'’T HAVE TRANSFERRED
TO THIS SCHOOL.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE--
TELL ME, RICK,
DON'’T YOU EVER GET FED UP
WITH THIS PLACE?
DON'’T YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF TEACHING?
DON'’T YOU FEEL THAT YOU WAN
T TO THROW YOUR BRIEFCASE AWAY
AND TAKE A FLIER SOMEPLACE,
ANYPLACE, WITH ME MAYBE?
DON'’T YOU?
DON'’T YOU,
RICK?
AHH, I GUESS NOT.
YOU'’D LIKE TO,
ALL RIGHT,
BUT YOU'’RE MARRIED.
YOU'’RE MARRIED,
AND I'’M BORED.
YOU'’RE AFRAID,
AND I'’M CHOOSY,
AND YOU CAN'’T BE CHOOSY,
OR YOU LIVE ALONE.
YOU KEEP THINKING
THAT WAY,
YOU'’RE GONNA END UP
IN A MESS OF TROUBLE.
MR. DADIER?
I'’LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU, MILLER.
I GOT TO GET TO MY JOB.
GOOD NIGHT, LOIS.
[RING]...
...[RING]
DARLING?
YOUR HUSBAND
IS WITH HER RIGHT NOW.
STOP IT.
STOP IT.
PLEASE, PLEASE
DON'’T CALL ANYMORE.
WOULD YOU PLEASE
LEAVE ME ALONE?
PLEASE
LEAVE ME ALONE.
[CLICK]
I DON'’T NEED
NO MORE SCHOOLING.
WHY? WHY, MILLER?
WHAT'’S WRONG
WITH BEING A MECHANIC?
YOU DON'’T WANT
TO BE, DO YOU?
THERE AIN'’T MUCH CHOICE,
IS THERE?
FOR THE SAME REASON
I LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
COLORED NEIGHBORHOOD,
MR. DADIER.
NOW, FOLKS DON'’T CARE
WHO FIX UP THEIR CAR,
BLACK OR WHITE,
JUST SO LONG
AS IT'’S FIXED GOOD.
YOU'’RE LATE, BOY.
I'’LL BE EARLY
TOMORROW NIGHT.
THIS ONE NEEDS A NEW SET
OF SPARK PLUGS.
THEY'’LL PICK IT UP
AT 9:00.
OK.
YOU THINK WE GOT
A GOOD SCHOOL, MR. DADIER?
YES.
DO YOU REALLY
THINK THAT?
THE IMPORTANT
THING IS,
DO YOU
WANT TO LEARN?
IN THE BEGINNING,
I TRIED...REAL HARD,
BUT WHAT'’S THE USE?
NOBODY GIVES A HOOT--
NOT THE OTHER FELLAS,
NOT THE TEACHERS,
NOT MY FOLKS EVEN.
SO YOU QUIT TRYING.
THAT'’S THE EASY
WAY OUT, MILLER.
THAT'’S THE ONLY WAY.
SOMETIMES WE'’VE GOT
TO DO WHAT'’S BEST,
EVEN THOUGH
THAT MIGHT BE
THE MORE
DIFFICULT WAY.
WE'’RE TALKING FROM DIFFERENT
SIDES OF THE FENCE, MR. DADIER.
YOU'’RE NOT BLACK.
THAT'’S NOT A GOOD
ENOUGH EXCUSE,
NOT NOWADAYS, AND YOU
KNOW IT, MILLER.
AND DR. RALPH BUNCHE
PROVED THAT.
GEORGE
WASHINGTON CARVER,
MARIAN ANDERSON,
JOE LOUIS.
SO?
.
SO I DON'’T WANT YOU
NOW, YOU'’LL BE OF AGE
THE END OF THIS TERM.
DON'’T GIVE UP
TRYING, MILLER.
DON'’T QUIT.
MR. DADIER, YOU'’RE
PRETTY NEW AT THIS.
SOON YOU'’RE GONNA BE
QUITTIN'’ YOURSELF.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'’LL
MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU.
WE'’LL HAVE SORT OF
A PACT, YOU AND I:
NEITHER OF US QUIT.
HOW ABOUT IT?
SAY, NOW,
THAT WASN'’T TRUE,
WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT TEACHERS.
SOME OF US DO CARE,
YOU KNOW?
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
[SIREN]
THEY JUST TOOK HER
TO THE HOSPITAL,
EMERGENCY.
.
I JUST DROPPED IN TO
WHO? WHAT HAPPENED?
YOUR MISSIS, I MEAN.
SHE STARTED TO HAVE
TERRIBLE PAINS,
JUST TERRIBLE!
AHEAD OF TIME!
7 MONTHS!
OH, DON'’T WORRY, MR. DADIER,
I'’LL BRING HER THINGS! OOH.
[DING DING DING]
OH.
BEEN HERE LONG?
YES, QUITE A WHILE.
IS SHE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT?
SHE'’S FINE,
MR. DADIER.
YOU'’RE SURE?
YES, YOUR WIFE
IS FINE.
SHE JUST HAD A BOY.
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU MEANHAD?
WELL, HE'’S
STILL IN DANGER.
I DON'’T UNDERSTAND.
WELL, THE BABY
WASPREMATURE.
THAT,
TOGETHER WITH--
WHAT WAS YOUR WIFE
WORRIED ABOUT,
MR. DADIER?
SHE SEEMED TO BE
MENTALLY DISTURBED.
SHE WOULDN'’T TALK
ABOUT IT.
OH, SHE LOST
A BABY ONCE.
NO, NO. NO.
I KNOW ABOUT THAT.
NO. THIS WAS
SOMETHING SECRET.
THERE WAS NO TROUBLE
BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR WIFE,
MR. DADIER?
I'’M SORRY.
IS THE BABY
GOING TO LIVE?
I DON'’T KNOW.
3 OR 4 DAYS
SHOULD TELL US THAT.
DOES ANNE--
I MEAN...
HAVE YOU TOLD ANNE
ABOUT THE BABY YET?
MIND IF I SEE HER?
WELL, SHE'’S STILL
IN A TWILIGHT CONDITION,
NOT FULLY AWAKE OR
FULLY ASLEEP, BUT...
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN SEE HER.
THANK YOU.
ARTHUR!
HI.
HI.
YOU--ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?
TIRED.
JUST AWFULLY TIRED.
I THINK I COULD
SLEEP FOR A WEEK.
YEAH.
LOOK, HONEY, YOU TRY
AND GET SOME SLEEP, HUH?
NO, DON'’T GO.
NOT YET.
WAIT UNTIL
THEY CHASE YOU.
IT HAPPENED
KIND OF SUDDENLY.
WE MADE IT THIS TIME,
DIDN'’T WE?
YEAH.
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE BABY YET?
NO.
NO, I HAVEN'’T.
IT'’S A BOY,
ISN'’T IT?
YEAH.
HAPPY, RICK?
SURE.
STILL LOVE ME?
OH, ANNE,
I LOVE YOU.
LOOK, I LOVE YOU
VERY, VERY MUCH.
I BROUGHT THESE THINGS
FOR MRS. DADIER.
THANK YOU.
MRS. BROPHY...
THANKS A LOT FOR
ALL OF YOUR TROUBLE.
TROUBLE, MISTER?
WHAT DO MEN KNOW
ABOUT TROUBLE?
I FOUND THESE LETTERS
ON THE FLOOR. I GUESS
SHE WAS READING THEM
WHEN THE PAIN STARTED.
I DON'’T UNDERSTAND YOU,
MISTER.
I JUST DON'’T UNDERSTAND YOU.
[DING DING DING]
IT'’S A NECKTIE,
A GIFT
FROM THE KIDS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
THE KIDS WERE ONLY TRYING
TO SHOW THEIR APPRECIATION
OF WHAT YOU DID
FOR THEM.
YEAH? WELL, I'’D LIKE TO
GIVE THEM SOMETHING
FOR WHAT
THEY DID TO ME.
THE SHOW WAS
A BIG SUCCESS TONIGHT.
MILLER AND HIS BOYS
SANG BEAUTIFULLY!
I DON'’T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT IT, JIM. I DON'’T...
I DON'’T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE SHOW,
ABOUT THE SCHOOL, ABOUT
MILLER, ABOUT ANYTHING...
'’CAUSE I'’M THROUGH.
I'’M FINISHED. I'’M QUITTIN'’.
AS FAR AS I'’M CONCERNED,
THAT SCHOOL IS JUST DEAD.
WHAT WAS IT
YOU CALLED IT, HUH?
WAS IT A GREAT
BIG GARBAGE CAN, HUH?
YEAH? OH, MAN,
HOW RIGHT YOU WERE.
WELL, I'’VE HAD IT
RIGHT UP TO HERE.
I'’M QUITTING.
I'’M GETTING ANOTHER JOB...
...10 MILES
AND 3,000 DELINQUENTS
AWAY FROM HERE.
NO, NO.
NO, I WAS THE ONE
THAT WAS WRONG.
YOU PROVED SOMETHING.
THE KIDS IN OUR SCHOOL
CAN BE TAUGHT
IF YOU DON'’T STOP TRYING.
YOU GOT THROUGH TO THEM.
AND THOSE SAME KIDS,
WHEN THEY CAME INTO MY CLASS,
A LITTLE OF YOUR MOMENTUM
CARRIED OVER,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I WANTED TO GET
THROUGH TO THEM, TOO.
HEY, THAT WAS A BIG DAY
FOR ME.
IF I COULD HAVE 2 DAYS
A WEEK LIKE--
YOU CAN HAVE IT.
YOU CAN HAVE IT.
JUST REMEMBER
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
WHAT WAS IT?
'DON'’T TURN YOUR BACK
ON '’EM.' HUH?
NOW, LOOK,
IF YOU QUIT HERE,
YOU'’LL QUIT AT
THE NEXT SCHOOL, TOO,
THEN YOU'’LL QUIT TEACHING
ALTOGETHER.
SO WHAT?
WHO CARES, JIM?
WHO--WHO CARES?
YOU THINK
THE KIDS CARE,
THEIR PARENTS CARE?
WHO CARES
ABOUT TEACHERS ANYHOW?
LOOK, I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING, JIM,
I WROTE DOWN.
NOW, JUST
LISTEN TO THIS.
TEACHERS GET $2.00
AN HOUR, RIGHT?
NOW, LISTEN,
'A CONGRESSMAN
AND A JUDGE...
'ARE $9.25 AN HOUR.
'POLICEMEN AND FIREMEN,
$2.75 AN HOUR.
'CARPENTER, 281.
PLUMBER, 2.97.
PLASTERER, 3.21.'
YOU KNOW,
A HOUSEHOLD COOK GETS
MORE MONEY THAN WE DO,
AND THEY GET
ROOMANDBOARD.
OH, YES, I KNOW,
A TEACHER,
THEY GET AS MUCH
AS A BABYSITTER
OR A SODA JERK.
$2.00 AN HOUR
FOR A TEACHER.
Radio announcer: WE TAKE YOU NOW
TO TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YORK.
IN A FEW MOMENTS,
THE NEW YEAR WILL
BE OFFICIALLY BORN.
COME IN, TIMES SQUARE.
[PARTY HORNS BLOWING]
HI.
THANK YOU.
YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT?
NOW THAT YOU'’RE HERE.
WHAT'’S THE MATTER?
WHAT? NOTHING.
IS IT
ABOUT THE BABY?
I DIDN'’T SEE
THE DOCTOR, ANNE.
HE WAS BUSY, AND--
Announcer: HAPPY NEW YEAR.
[TURNS OFF RADIO]
I'’M SCARED, ANNE.
I'’M REALLY SCARED.
WHAT IF THE BABY
DOESN'’T LIVE?
HE WILL.
I KNOW HE WILL.
WELL, WHAT IF
HE DOESN'’T, HMM?
YOU KNOW,
I WANTED THAT BABY.
I NEEDED THAT BABY
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DID
BECAUSE ALL MY LIFE,
I WANTED TO TEACH KIDS,
AND MY SON WAS GONNA--
HE WAS GONNA KIND OF
HELP ME, YOU KNOW?
.
THROUGH HIM, MAYBE
RICK.
HMM?
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
I LOVE YOU.
I WAS SILLY AND VAIN
AND SELFISH,
SO I DOUBTED YOU.
I WAS LIKE ONE OF
THE BAD KIDS IN YOUR CLASS--
SOMEBODY TOLD A LIE,
AND I BELIEVED THAT LIE.
NOW, ONE'’S AS BAD
AS THE OTHER.
LISTEN, I WANT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING--
I WAS WRONG ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.
I WANTED YOU TO QUIT
TEACHING IN THAT SCHOOL.
I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY YOU
WANTED TO KEEP TRYING.
PLEASE.
I'’M GLAD
YOU DIDN'’T QUIT.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
HONEY,
KIDS ARE PEOPLE,
AND MOST PEOPLE
ARE WORTHWHILE.
WE ALL NEED
THE SAME THING--
PATIENCE,
UNDERSTANDING, LOVE.
YOU'’VE GOT THAT
TO GIVE THEM, DARLING,
AND THAT'’S WHY YOU'’LL
GET THROUGH TO THEM.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YOUR SON'’S OUT OF DANGER.
HE'’S GONNA MAKE IT.
? SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE
BE FORGOT?
? AND NEVER BROUGHT TO MIND??
HAPPY NEW YEAR,
MR. AND MRS. DADIER.
? SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE
BE FORGOT?
? AND DAYS
OF AULD LANG SYNE??
PRETTY SOON,
YOU'’RE GONNA BE READING
IN THE NEWSPAPERS
WANT ADS FOR JOBS,
APARTMENTS,
SOMETHING TO BUY.
NOW, ADVERTISING SPACE
IS VERY EXPENSIVE,
SO ABBREVIATIONS
ARE USED.
NOW WRITE OUT COMPLETE WORDS
TO ALL THE ABBREVIATIONS
IN THESE PROBLEM ADS.
ALL RIGHT, GET STARTED.
[RUSTLING]
BELAZI.
JUST KEEP YOUR EYES
ON YOUR OWN PAPER.
ME?
CHEATING WON'’T HELP YOU
LEARN THOSE ABBREVIATIONS,
YOU KNOW.
HE'’S NOT GONNA
LOOK FOR NO JOB.
HIS OLD MAN
