There're over 1100 tunnels in Norway,
most without emergency exits or rooms
The tunnel safety in Norway
is based on self-support
It's your own responsibility
to get out
Since 2011 there have been
eight big fires in tunnels
Only coincidences and heroic acts
have prevented casualties
This movie is inspired
by those events
Dad's not coming.
He's busy with Ingrid.
I guess I'll get a new family soon.
I don't think it'll snow
on Christmas Eve this year.
It'll be the first time
in a long while.
Merry Christmas, mom.
THE TUNNEL
{\an8}MOUNTAIN PLATEAU
TOWARDS THE EAST ENTRANCE
{\an8}3117 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL
-I can't see a thing.
-The road's still there.
Stay focused and keep an even speed,
or you'll get stuck.
I still have to look down
to change gears.
Ivar?
-Have you lost control back there?
-If I've lost control?
That asshole spun out of the convoy
and drove right past you.
-You have to stop him.
-I can't see him now.
-Håkon can do it before the tunnel.
-Let's see how far he gets first.
The road's extremely slippery
in about 550 yards.
{\an8}-How's it going down there?
-People are starting to show up.
The kids are checking it out,
and they're happy.
Did you hear that the storm
blew the Christmas tree down?
-That happened last year too.
-Hi!
-Who was that?
-Christian.
Did you talk to Elise?
No. I was so busy last week,
so I haven't found the right...
There're only two days left.
Let's drop it.
I don't care. I like to be alone.
Not on Christmas Eve.
I want you to be there.
I'll talk to Elise tonight.
No problem.
Something's happening here.
I have to go.
I'll talk to you later.
Gray silverfish?
No, that can't be right.
I wouldn't have sold an apartment
if I had known about that.
Hi! Can you get me on the road again?
-You can't drive past a convoy.
-It was a convoy?
I'm in a hurry. I have to get
to the Christmas play.
-Hi. Are you okay?
-Yes.
-Can you pull my car out?
-No time. People are waiting.
I can call a tow truck,
but it might take some time.
Do you want to wait at your own risk?
Exactly... How long does it take?
{\an8}ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL WEST, BERGEN
{\an8}Double shift?
Don't you ever have time off?
Andrea?
She's living here.
She's moved in.
The traffic needs to be monitored
at Christmas too.
Merry Christmas.
-Drive carefully.
-Eat that gingerbread.
{\an8}EAST ENTRANCE
It's about time!
I'm freezing my balls off!
-Are we opening the road?
-I don't think so.
Are you opening the road?
It's fine now. There's black asphalt
all the way through.
-What about the snow dune at Støylen?
-There's supposed to be snow there.
We have to get people home
for Christmas. Let's do that.
-Can you go to the technical room?
-Sure.
Come on!
You have one new message.
Hi, dad. I'm at mom's grave.
Why do we always
have to wait for you?
-Hi.
-Are you on your way?
I'm in the middle of the tunnel.
-How's it going down there?
-Stein? Hello?
Hello?
{\an8}THE TECHNICAL ROOM, 2.5 MILES IN
Hello, it's Elise.
I can't answer the phone right now.
But leave a message after the beep.
Bye!
{\an8}WEST ENTRANCE
{\an8}VIK PLOW AND FIRE STATION
It's a Tesla.
Make him pay.
Double overtime, right? Great.
Check.
Keep your cell phone on!
-Don't you see it?
-More snow is coming.
That Tesla guy isn't going
through the tunnel until tonight.
Did you lose?
{\an8}MOUNTAIN INN, EAST SIDE
Hi! Are you too going over
the plateau?
Hello, "Plateau". I'm Anatol.
I'm Tom. Nice to meet you.
Do you have good tires?
I'm not tired. I drive kitchen.
My first job for Norway.
A lot of snow is coming, so we have
to go before they close the road.
Okay, you first!
Hi! Can I get a lift to Bergen?
I can't take any passengers
due to my cargo,-
-but ask "Mr. Kitchen" behind me.
Okay.
Tom, no hitchhikers!
I always drive alone!
Westerly breeze and fresh gale
in exposed places.
Sleet and snow flurries
in central and higher areas.
Møre og Romsdal and Trøndelag,
westerly fresh to near gale.
Sure. We'll be salting
both in the morning and evening.
Yes, we can take a lot of traffic.
Sure, no problem.
Bye.
-There's a storm coming.
-It might not hit us.
They don't know how far south.
We've managed it before.
That was just dumb luck. You know
how fast the weather can turn.
Maybe you should
be a meteorologist, Stein?
It's your vacation,
and the traffic flows nicely.
Just imagine the line
if we closed the road!
Merry Christmas, Stein.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
Have a good time with Ingrid,
you lucky bastard!
Shit... You're lucky.
Ingrid... It's more than luck.
It's like the lottery!
I wanna hear you say "yes"!
Yes, you're lucky!
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!
Elise?
Just give her the flowers.
-I've got some roses for you.
-Oh yeah? They're nice.
I bought them on the way here.
-Hi, Mona.
-How nice.
Can you try the mulled wine? I made
15 gallons for your Christmas market.
I wanted to talk to Stein.
Do you know when he'll get down?
He's on his way.
I just talked to him. Here you go.
There's not a lot of snow this year.
Didn't you promise us snow?
Don't talk about the climate again.
The mountains are full of snow.
Let's hope we'll get snow
for Christmas Eve.
You see?
Hey... Tell Stein
that I want to talk to him.
But leave a message after the beep.
Bye!
Hi, Elise. Did you get my message?
It would be nice
to have a little chat.
I've bought dinner. I'll see you
at home in a little while.
We leave in five minutes.
Five minutes.
-Hi there.
-Hi.
Hi!
Elise is here.
She's waiting for you over there.
Hi!
-Hi.
-Hi there.
Nice to see you.
Dad...
-I waited for you that long.
-I was working and didn't make it.
But you came here.
How long can you hold
your breath now?
New record? Hey, time me.
I'm not ten years old anymore.
Quit it.
Don't do that! Stop!
Hi! Are you hungry?
What? What are you doing?
-He's trying to be funny.
-I'm trying to beat Elise.
-You're not even close.
-Can I buy you lunch?
No thanks. Did you wanna
talk to me about something?
Yes.
I can do it now.
Ingrid and I have talked
a bit about Christmas.
It would've been nice if...
...we celebrated it together,
the three of us.
Don't you have anybody else
to celebrate Christmas with, Ingrid?
-No, I don't, but...
-Are you pregnant?
No.
-It was just a suggestion.
-So I'm getting a new mom?
You never talk about mom anymore.
We can talk more
about mom if you want.
Do you think
that I'll just forget mom?
We're not going to forget mom.
We are never going to forget mom.
You and I will never forget mom.
But it's been three years.
We have to move on.
-I have to move on.
-Life must go on?
Of all the things we learned
at the grief seminar,-
-that's what you picked up?
It's just "Ingrid, Ingrid, Ingrid"
all the time. Goddammit!
Elise. Elise, where are you going?!
That's none of your
or Ingrid's business!
Stein!
Have a seat.
We'll take care of the ticket later.
Some kid just got on. What if they
stopped for everyone who was late?
I would like to welcome you
to the express bus to Oslo.
The trip will take
approximately seven hours.
Remember to wear the seat belt
at all times during the trip.
My name is Laila Årnes,
and I'll get you safely there.
-No, Harry is my hamster!
-I hate you!
Hey, quit it!
No one hates each other.
-It's not only your hamster.
-You said that Harry was mine.
We'll share him. Mom, can you say
that it belongs to both of us?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Do you have any painkillers?
-I've got travel sickness pills.
They don't help with
Christmas party hangovers.
-Are you nauseous?
-No.
-Is it lutefisk for dinner today?
-Yes.
MOUNTAIN PASS
OPEN
Tom?
Do you know what happened
last time I picked up a hitchhiker?
Tom? You won't believe it!
Hi. Are you too going to Oslo?
-Christmas at grandma's.
-Cool.
Is everything alright?
I'm going to my mom's. It's her turn.
She's got new kids,
and her boyfriend loves Christmas.
Check this out. This is how much
my stepdad loves Christmas.
He's got his Joseph costume on
and is fine.
We're just gonna pull the Tesla out.
It'll only take a few minutes.
You'll have him
all through Christmas.
One more day with me
shouldn't be a problem.
-Just pull it out, and I'll drive on.
-No.
Do you need help?
Why would we need help?
Because we pee sitting down?
{\an8}WEST ENTRANCE
I don't like tunnels. What about you?
I've sort of grown up in here.
{\an8}EAST ENTRANCE
Tom? Anatol calling!
Tom, are you there?
Last time, hitchhiker robbed me.
Can you believe that, Tom? Pick up!
Don't you want to hear
whole story, Tom?
She fucked me and robbed me!
She fucked me and robbed me!
Stop!
Tom, are you okay? What happened?
{\an8}ALARM CENTER, FØRDE
Medical emergency number 113.
-This is Marius.
-Tom Hillestad here.
I've had an accident in the Storfjell
tunnel with a tank truck.
-Are you hurt?
-No, but the road is blocked.
But the tanks do not seem
to be leaking.
Are you transporting gasoline?
Hello? Tom?
SOLO ACCIDENT
CARGO UNKNOWN
We're on our way now. Yes.
Tunnel!
Close tunnel. Close tunnel.
Close tunnel.
Do you know how many times
I've driven through this tunnel?
The signal is bad.
We're driving into the tunnel now.
No, the plateau is open.
Hello?
-A storm is coming.
-No problem. Shall we do the math?
I'm 46 and have driven through it
twice a week since I was 16.
The most important thing is
why you drove through the tunnel.
Because you wanted to visit
a cute girl whose name was...
Anette.
-Mia!
-Mia. Of course, Mia.
And suddenly you two are
in the back seat, plus Harry.
Oh no, no...
Fuck!
It's not possible. I'm stuck!
-No, get out of here.
-It's stuck! There's a car behind.
This is Andrea
from Road Traffic Control in Bergen.
-Where are you in the tunnel?
-A couple of miles in. One or two.
No, more than that. I'm not sure.
Okay. Alright, Tom.
We'll do this slowly.
The tunnel is 5.6 miles long.
Did you drive in from the east or west?
Do you see an emergency telephone
or a fire extinguisher nearby?
-Pick it up so I can locate you.
-I drove in from the plateau.
I'm trying to get
a semi-trailer truck past me.
What? Don't let anyone get past you.
Hello? Can you hear me?
What did you do? This isn't my truck!
Turn around!
-They're going away. I'll try again.
-Go back, around me and out.
I've closed the tunnel,
but I lost contact with the driver.
-Do you know where he is?
-One to two miles in from the east.
-But it could be more.
-I'll alert the ambulance and police.
{\an8}WEST SIDE, 2.5 MILES IN
-Is it a convoy?
-I think there's been an accident.
-So we're stuck here for Christmas.
-I don't care.
Let's go outside
and see what's happening.
Excuse me.
Isn't there a camera in the tunnel?
No, only a webcam at the east exit.
By the convoy barrier.
RTC, Egil Ramsvik.
Yes. The Storfjell tunnel is closed.
We don't know
the extent of damage at this time.
Tom, are you there?
Marius? He drove in through
the east entrance at 12.11 PM.
-When was the accident reported?
-12.14.
Three minutes later.
We don't know how long it took
to report it, or his speed.
2.17 minus response time...
If he was going the speed limit,
he's one to two miles in.
{\an8}Sierra 0-1 responding.
Stange fire department is moving out.
-Come as fast as you can.
-We can be there in about 50 minutes.
A tank truck accident
in the Storfjell tunnel.
No fire, but get
the local fire department up there.
Is Stange on their way?
They've got the best equipment.
They're on their way,
but we need you on the west side.
-Hello?
-Get up!
-Testing. Do you hear me?
-Yes!
We are going to sing
some Christmas carols here in Vik-
-together with students
from the fifth grade.
Christian.
According to the emergency plan,
it's Stange's responsibility.
The weather is lousy
on the east side.
Then we'll be first.
I think she needs you to talk to her.
I'm trying, but I don't know how.
Sure you know how.
-You do it with me.
-That's just luck.
-It's Christian.
-You have to answer.
-No, I don't.
-Oh, stop!
-Stein?
-You don't quit, do you?
The emergency service needs you.
A tank truck has crashed
into the wall inside the tunnel.
-One new message.
-Hi, Elise. It's dad.
It's not me
who should decide everything.
I'm standing outside. I'm unlocking
the door to your room now.
There's no signal.
-There must have been an accident.
-Can't we just hitchhike out of here?
-Hi, dad.
-Hi.
-Aren't you on Christmas vacation?
-We need our best people now.
We've been asked to get
the fire truck up to the tunnel.
I've talked to the police.
They'll be there in an hour.
We're not waiting for them.
Have you talked
to Stange fire department?
-Do they know?
-Road Traffic Control calledme!
I do what they tell me. That's what
I've done. If you wanna take over...
Ivar, this is a rescue operation.
I'm in charge now.
Stein, you're driving
the lead vehicle.
-Where's the rest of the crew?
-They're on Christmas vacation.
If it gets serious up there,
I need you.
Put it on.
{\an8}MOUNTAIN PLATEAU, EAST ENTRANCE
{\an8}If this is the convoy line,
it must be windy on the plateau.
-It was open when we drove up.
-Mommy!
-Sara says that she's in charge.
-You little brat!
Stop, or I'll throw you out of
the car, and you'll have to walk!
That's not allowed, mom!
-Maybe we should drive back?
-No.
-Is there enough power?
-We've got lots of power.
Mia. Mia!
Jesus Christ!
Shit, they crashed!
-Where's the tank truck?
-It's here, on the east side.
-What's that?
-A fire extinguisher is removed.
On the west side? Is there a fire?
No. The fire ventilation
starts automatically.
If there's a fire,
the sensors will show it.
Okay. There's no fire.
But I want to know exactly
where the tank truck is.
Yes? That's right.
Come on, Tom.
Hi, Marius.
The fire ventilation is activated.
When will Stange fire department
be at the east side?
I'll check.
I had to help a guy
who had driven off the road.
Hey, listen. We'll take care of this.
I'll fix this.
Yeah, you've got a point.
-I want brown Christmas soda!
-It's now red.
What kind of expert have you
talked to? Is it the pest control?
It is?
How many insects have you found?
Three or four?
Okay, okay, I get it.
Here's what we'll do.
-I want brown Christmas soda!
-Here!
Drink this, "Joseph"!
God doesn't want to hear anymore.
Do you understand?
It's gonna be fine.
{\an8}WEST SIDE
-They're struggling.
-Looks like a vintage car procession.
Christian? Any news
from Road Traffic Control?
No, not yet.
Back as a rescue worker, huh?
Why did you quit?
I promised Mona
I'd take care of Elise.
Tell them to turn their cars around
and get out.
Hey, no filming! You have to go out.
You have to go out.
You can't film here.
Go into your cars.
You have to turn your car around.
Girls, no filming. Go into your cars.
Okay? You can't pass here.
-Everyone into the bus!
-What was that?
-Nothing good.
-Into the bus!
-What was that sound?
-Go into the bus, everybody!
Stay in your seats.
-Oh my God!
-Come on!
Run!
Hey! Hey!
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
-Why don't you drive out?
-I can't turn around in here.
-Back up! Do something!
-You have to wait here.
Hey! Listen to her! She's right!
This smoke is deadly!
We're all dead.
We're stranded in the tunnel.
What is that?
-Is it smoke?
-Yes, several sensors have gone off.
-The tank truck?
-Probably, but I don't know. Hold on.
Hi. Several sensors have gone off
in the tunnel. Both east and west.
-Is there a fire now?
-There's no doubt.
I'll call the rescue service
and the air ambulance.
-How high up is the tunnel?
-3117 feet above sea level.
I'm receiving a message.
Stange fire department can't get in
from the east side.
-They can't get up from the east.
-Hold on.
The press is calling.
I need to know what to say.
This is David Bøe. We're in
the middle of the Storfjell tunnel.
-What did they say?
-There's a fire further in.
It's fine. We should just turn on
the air recirculation and drive out.
-Is it dangerous?
-No, everything's fine.
Everything's fine. Everything's fine.
Mom, look!
Oh my God!
Hey, close the door!
-But he needs help.
-No, just wait.
What do we do now?
Out! Everybody out of the car now!
Out! Go to mommy!
Daddy! Daddy, come!
-David!
-Daddy!
-Did you get the same as me?
-Yes.
-Has anybody seen Elise?
-I saw her at the swimming pool.
-There's total chaos in the tunnel.
-Have you seen this?
It's total chaos.
Thank you.
-Hello? Stein? Where are you?
-We're on our way to the tunnel.
-What's happening?
-Nobody knows. No one's there yet.
Have you seen Elise?
Can you check at home?
Yeah, sure. Be careful, Stein.
-Holy shit. What's happened here?
-It's the tank truck.
I'll talk to them.
Get the emergency control cabinet
open.
The crew from Vik
has arrived on the west side.
Håkon! Crowbar!
-Are there more people in there?
-I couldn't see a thing.
-There're a lot of people in there.
-You have to help them.
We will. Kurt, take care of him.
There're a lot of people in there.
Are the fans running?
The fire ventilation is activated
in a westerly direction.
Towards us?
According to the emergency plan,
the evacuation happens from Stange.
-They've got the equipment.
-Have they arrived?
There's an avalanche at Støylen.
They're working their way through it.
-Is it just us on this side?
-Yes.
-Is the emergency network working?
-There's no signal.
-It's never worked here.
-Shit!
If you can turn the direction
of the fans, we'll go in.
{\an8}STØYLEN, EAST SIDE
Go back! Switch to a shovel!
-Did they get in?
-The smoke comes towards them.
They want an easterly fan direction.
Do we know exactly
where the fire is? East or west?
East. There's no doubt.
I've calculated it.
He couldn't have gotten more than
two miles in before he hit the wall.
But a fire extinguisher was removed
one mile in from the west side.
Where did the smoke go out first?
Smoke out at 12.52 PM, east exit.
-12.52 PM, east exit. West?
-We don't know. No witnesses.
-There's smoke there too.
-So we don't know where the fire is.
I'm sure the fire is
one to two miles in from the east.
People get caught in the smoke
on the west side.
300 bar.
They want to know
where the fire is first.
-Easy for them to say.
-There're people in there.
Take care of things out here.
Ivar and I are going in to search.
Ten minutes in,
and ten minutes out again.
-Take no chances in there.
-HRS Rescue 8.
West of the Storfjell tunnel.
We're flying in standby mode.
Hello, it's Elise.
I can't answer the phone right now.
That's fine.
Here. Take this
so you don't lose the signal.
Okay. We're going in.
Merry Christmas.
-What are you doing?
-Self-support.
-Is someone coming to help us?
-No one wants to drive in the smoke.
We have to get out by ourselves.
-David, try calling again.
-Jesus! It doesn't work.
You have to try! Come on! Please!
-There's nothing!
-But try, goddammit!
-Stay there.
-Daddy...
-Stay here! Watch your sister!
-Mommy!
-David!
-Daddy!
Mommy!
-Just keep close to me.
-I can't see a thing!
I'll check the car.
Christian calling Stein.
Do you get any heat readings?
No temperature increase so far.
The fire must be further in.
Try to search further east.
Ivar?
-Holy shit!
-I told you to keep close! Hey!
Breathe slowly.
We have to go further in.
-Further in?
-We have to go further in, Ivar!
Yes. No, I can't take it anymore.
TELEPHONE RECEIVER OFF
Help me. Help me!
-Who are you?
-Anatol Kaminski, driver.
Can you see the fire, Anatol?
I saw the tank blow up.
Big explosion. My face melted.
Where is the fire?
Me and Tom drove over the mountain
and in maximum 1.2 miles.
Can't walk any further.
No air in here!
Listen to me, Anatol.
Find a car and stay there.
Anatol, put the air conditioning
on recirculation.
Okay, everybody. Listen up!
The fire is confirmed by a witness.
1.2 miles in from the east,
4.4 miles in from the west.
-Are you sure?
-Yes. I'll turn the fan direction.
Good.
Sara!
Martine!
Sara!
My husband is dead.
My husband is dead.
Have you seen two little girls?
Stein? Can you hear me?
Do you have problems in there?
Ivar?
Shit! Get out!
Nice. Good job.
Get some water.
-Are you okay, Ivar?
-Yes.
-Do you want any water?
-I'm fine!
Give him a couple of minutes.
Can you get me a new oxygen tank?
It's rough in there, but no heat.
They've turned
the direction of the fans.
-Are the fans at full speed?
-They're going at 13 feet per second.
They can go much faster than that!
Shit!
-Ivar!
-We can't see shit in there!
We should've left with the others.
They're probably outside now.
-Let's go.
-It's two to three miles!
-You'll suffocate!
-What do you know?
-Let the grownups talk.
-I know this tunnel well.
-My dad works here.
-She's grown up in here.
-Open the door.
-Don't open it!
Open the door!
Help me.
Lean back.
-I'm getting out of here!
-We can't go out in that smoke!
-Move!
-Hey!
Okay! Hey, everybody!
I know a place where we can breathe.
It's a place to shelter.
There's been an accident involving
a tank truck in the Storfjell tunnel.
-What kind of fuel is in the truck?
-I can't comment on that.
It's the worst time for this.
People are driving home for Christmas.
Wait, mom!
Laila, we're leaving!
Isn't she coming?
Stop! There's a room
a few hundred yards that way!
-We can't go further in!
-A place to wait for help!
-We have to go out!
-Listen to me!
Stay low! Breathe into your sweaters
and follow me.
Hi there. I'll take care of this.
I'll fix this.
-There are long lines...
-I'll devote Christmas to this.
I can't comment on the extent
of damage or the number of people.
What are you doing?!
Do you know what's happening?!
People are fighting for their lives.
You got away, and me too,
perhaps because of an idiot like you.
Why do you waste your time
yelling at your son? He's alive.
He's alive! You're alive!
...keep your distance. The tunnel
is closed in both directions.
We'll let you know when we know more.
Thank you.
There's a fire
in the Storfjell tunnel.
It has been confirmed
that a tank truck is involved.
Here's a recording
from just before the fire started.
It was filmed by someone who got out.
Come on! Answer! Answer!
Answer!
-Hi.
-Stein! Elise is in the tunnel!
-She's inside the tunnel.
-What do you mean?
I saw a film clip on TV. Someone
who got out, had filmed the line.
She stood outside the express bus.
I'm one hundred percent sure.
She got on the bus to Oslo.
Shit!
-What's happening? Are we going in?
-Yes.
-Elise is in the tunnel.
-What?
Can you get fire blankets
and some water?
-How many blankets?
-As many as you can. Come on.
-What the hell is he doing?!
-Elise...
-Elise is in the tunnel.
-Oh my God...
Hello? Hi, my name is Elise Berge.
We've left the express bus and are
going to a small room in the tunnel.
A technical room.
We call it "The Cave".
Can you tell Stein Berge
that we're in The Cave?
Who's Stein Berge?
Is he a firefighter?
Elise? Hello, are you there?
Hey!
-What are you doing?
-I'm turning the fans to full speed.
Hey! Take it easy!
-It might be too much for them.
-Stein is in there now.
They can take it. It says so here.
Make a decision!
Come back, Stein! Stein!
Come on!
-There's a lot of smoke in here!
-There's more outside.
For now. But in a few minutes
it'll be just as bad in here.
My God.
There's air here. Here.
Okay, but...
You're not the only one
who needs air.
Stein, can you hear me? Come out!
I'm going to the technical room
in the middle of the tunnel.
-Hello?
-Road Traffic Contr...
Hello? Who is it?
Can I talk to mommy? Mommy?
-Hush! Hello?
-Hi. Who are you?
Sara. Aren't you
coming to get us soon?
Hi, Sara. I'm Andrea.
Is your mom or dad there?
We can't find them.
There was a lot of smoke, and...
-We can't breathe!
-We? Who's "we", Sara?
Martine, my kid sister.
Hi. Listen to me.
You have to find a car and go inside.
Do you understand?
Is there a car nearby?
-She says that we have to find a car.
-Yes, any car.
Crawl in and close all the doors.
It's easier to breathe in there.
Don't go out.
Do you hear me, Sara?
Don't get out of the car.
-Is it far? I can't see anything.
-Sara, I know how you must feel now.
And it's okay to be afraid.
I was also very afraid once,
but it went fine.
Just listen to me,
and everything will be fine.
Sara? Are you there? Can you hear me?
-Yes.
-We can go to the postman over there.
Hello? Martine? Who's the postman?
-Sara?
-Martine, wait!
It's empty.
-What?
-There's no more air.
-No, it's...
-Yes.
-I'm leaving.
-What? Where are you going?
Hold on! I'll go with you.
-Hey there! Hey!
-Wait, I'll go with you!
Shit.
No way that you'll open the door now!
Move!
What's your plan?
Go inside.
Do you think
that anybody will find us here?
My dad will come.
Have you talked to him?
-How does he know where we are?
-You ran away without telling him.
This is a news broadcast concerning
the fire in the Storfjell tunnel.
There's a lot of smoke build-up,
and the lines are long.
According to several sources,
Express Bus West is inside...
-Sogndal fire department is coming.
-We're ready now.
You have to wait
until it's safe to go in.
Wait for Sogndal?
We have to go in now!
We will, but we need a green light.
Stein? Can you hear me?
Stein? We're not allowed to go in.
Your mom taught me to swim.
Did you know that?
Do you call that swimming?
I call it dog paddling.
Are you a racist?
You gave a nice memorial speech,
I remember.
Funny...and sad.
I could never have done that.
You don't know until you try.
I hope you don't have to.
Where's Stein?
-He drove in.
-What? Alone?
-Yes.
-Did he drive in alone?
-Why don't they do something?
-We're going in now.
-No, you're not going in there.
-You're not in charge anymore.
I understand,
but Sogndal is coming soon.
-"Soon" is too late.
-You're not going in there.
-You don't decide that!
-Hey...
I've only got you, Ivar.
Sogndal wants to talk to you.
Sara! Martine!
Sara!
Are you here?!
Elise!
Elise!
Elise!
Elise!
Elise.
-Hi.
-Hi!
Hi, honey.
Okay. Breathe through this. Breathe.
There you go.
Here! Put this on.
Here.
Breathe.
I've found five survivors
in the technical room three miles in.
We're evacuating
through the west exit.
I can hear you, Stein.
What about Elise?
-Did you find Elise?
-She's one of them. She's alive.
Five survivors
have been found in the tunnel.
Stein Berge
from Vik emergency service-
-is the only one
operating there now.
-Christian, emergency service.
-Hi, this is Andrea from RTC.
-Are you in contact with Stein Berge?
-I'm talking to him on the radio.
Come on!
-Stein? RTC wants to talk to you.
-Stein is answering!
Hello? Stein?
This is Andrea from RTC.
Are there two girls there?
Eight to nine years old.
-Keep going! There are no kids here.
-They called ten minutes ago.
An emergency telephone right by
The Cave where you found Elise.
I told them to get into a nearby car.
They can't have walked far.
They're all alone.
Can you search for them?
Stein?
Sara and Martine.
Sara and Martine.
Get into the motor home! Get in!
-Come on! You need the mask.
-It's out of air.
-Rafa, do you know how to drive?
-Yes.
-Can you drive this car?
-Aren't you going with us?
Rafa will drive it out.
I plowed my way through.
Just follow the center line.
-We can wait for you here.
-No. Listen!
-Drive Elise out of here.
-Okay.
I can't lose you now.
Please, don't go.
There are two girls in here.
I can't leave without trying.
Dad...
-I'm going out of the car.
-Dad...
You can do this. You can do this.
-Dad...
-I need the masks.
I need your mask! I need your mask!
Give it to me.
You'll get out of here soon.
-Dad!
-Rafa!
-Drive.
-Yeah, yeah...
Dad!
Rafa? Get the other ones out, okay?
What the hell are you doing?!
I have to help my dad.
Take this, then.
Thanks. I'll teach you to swim
when we get out.
See you on the outside!
Let's go!
Sara! Martine!
Hello?
Hello?!
-It's Stein Berge.
-Did you find Sara and Martine?
I've searched all the cars.
They're not here.
Are you sure?
They can't have walked far.
I'm running out of options.
I have to get out of here.
"Go to the postman."
Stein, do you see a mail van nearby?
They talked about
going to the postman.
There's no mail van here.
-I have to go. I have to get out.
-Wait, Stein!
Bring! Do you see a green Bring car?
Stein!
Stein!
Stein!
Get the stretcher!
Sara!
-Martine!
-You can't go in there!
They're not there.
They're not here, Mia.
Come on.
Are you okay?
I told them to stay there!
I told them to stay!
They are doing
all they can to find them.
I told them to stay there.
Have you seen my girls?
Have you seen my girls?!
Let him go!
-I've lost my kids.
-We'll find your kids.
Hello!
Hello!
Where's Elise?
Stein went to find two girls.
Elise went in to find him.
She went in to find him?
Sara! Martine!
Goddamn.
Hey!
Open the door. Come on. Come on!
Hi. Are you Sara? Are you okay? Here.
We need oxygen.
I've lost my kids.
You have to help me.
Please. Please!
Holy shit!
Dad!
Okay... Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on!
At a press conference, the Minister
of Transport and Communications-
-said this about the fire
in the tunnel...
What's happening?
We have to wait.
Get in.
Hi, Mona.
Dad!
-Go with mom.
-She's not here anymore. She's dead.
-You have to get the girls out.
-No, dad...
-Go.
-No, dad. Come on.
You can do it.
Dad...
-Go.
-Dad. Dad, come on!
Dad. Dad? Come on!
-Hello?
-Hello?
-Hello?
-Shit...
Please. Hello? Please.
There are two little girls here!
Fire and rescue are on their way.
Many people think that the road
should've been closed.
The accident happened
inside the tunnel.
Is someone out there?
Elise, can you hear me?
Where are you?
Dad's dying in here!
Ivar! Elise, this is Ingrid!
Stay where you are!
Don't go anywhere! We're coming!
Stop! Stop!
Ivar?
Go!
Elise, we're coming now!
Stange fire department here.
We're through the avalanche.
We'll be at the east entrance
in about ten minutes.
Dad... Let me see.
I beat my own record.
What do you say to that?
Did you think that you would beat me?
Dad!
Elise, press two times
if you can hear me!
I can't see a thing!
Keep your eyes on the road.
My God.
Stay here. Honk and flash the lights
every minute.
-I want to go with you.
-You work for me! Stay with Ingrid.
-What are you doing?!
-I don't work for you.
Elise!
Elise!
Elise!
Elise!
Ingrid!
-Move!
-Sorry!
Stein! Stein, can you hear me? Stein?
Ivar, the mask! Ivar!
Breathe!
-There you go.
-We have to get out!
Grab the bag!
Come on!
Keep going!
Over here! Here!
Dad!
Hey! No, let go!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Ivar?
-Stein!
-Dad!
Stein? Okay... Stein. Okay...
We have to lift him.
Are you alright? Okay. Get up.
Where's Ivar?
Ivar? Ivar!
-Dad?
-Ivar?
-Dad, come on.
-Ivar?
-Dad, come on!
-Stein, we have to go now!
We have to go!
Come on!
{\an8}EAST ENTRANCE
The road is there
even if you don't see it.
Stay focused and keep an even speed,
or you'll get stuck.
No one's calling anymore.
-I was so afraid!
-Relax. We're fine.
We're not in the tunnel.
-I thought so! It's on the news!
-We didn't get that far.
I didn't want to go over the mountain
in that weather.
Where is he?
No one is lighting their lamps
or leaving their doors ajar.
Closed are all the hearts and doors
for us in Bethlehem.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Hi, Stein. No one can answer me.
Did you get the girls out?
Hold on.
Hi.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Sara, is that you?
That's great to hear.
Yeah, yeah...
Come on.
Dad? Come on.
