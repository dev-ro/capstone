The office working hours of
Jackson Tolaram Private Limited...
begins at 10 am every morning
for the last 60 years
For the last 60 years,
at about 9 am every morning...
the employees of this company
have been setting out for work
General Manager,
Nowshirji Bomanji Batliwala...
uses imported dyes
to darken his hair
Who doesn't want to stay young? Time
was when his hair was naturally dark
His long-standing romance
with Shireen Daruwalla...
is still the talk of Malabar Hills.
The Batliwala-Daruwalla union...
bred four children.
All daughters
Heerji Nanji Parikh,
the Chief Accountant...
actively engaged in tallying his
own accounts too, vis-a-vis...
Hansa Mehta, junior employee in the
office. 20 years on, it still seems...
as if it began only yesterday.
Between 1947 and 1950...
romance blossomed at the office,
at Pamposh Restaurant in Bandra...
and under the trees in
the nearby Almeida Gardens
One day, the accountant succeeded
in balancing his ledger with Hansa
Hansa Mehta was elevated from
the little office table...
and entered Parikh's spacious
apartment, and today...
the accountant has three children
to his credit
M.K. Vasdevan Nambiar,
executive officer...
sandwiched between promotions,
allowances and overtime work...
he has never found
the time for romance
Once he met with an accident,
went to the hospital...
and seduced his nurse, Parvati Amma.
She was single too. They got married
Pandurang Ganpat Dhole,
loyal servant for 15 years...
has romanced no less than five women,
but the matter ended with...
Rukmini, a widow with two children.
And then romance wasn't enough
He had to marry her.
Rukmini's two and his three
How to feed a fivesome of kids
in an Indian home off 200 a month...
only a clever orderly working for
an Indian company can tell you
Arun Pradeep, Supervisor Grade 2.
Our protagonist
He too is eager to carry forward
the legacy of romance
He is in love with Prabha
who takes the Number 86 at 9:05 am
Irrespective of the fact that
Prabha is wholly ignorant of him
Here comes Prabha
And here's Arun's heart,
beating faster
Had they not cared for queues
as in Delhi and Calcutta...
Arun and Prabha would've been in the
same bus. Next time, maybe...
All this lady knows is how
to dress up and strut around...
and I get to do all the work.
- Why didn't you come...
for Rosie's wedding?
- Couldn't manage to get time off
Today he got off right after me, and
he followed me right up to the lift
Had you told me, I could've taken
a look at him
How could I say? He was standing
right behind me
He had this look on his face when
the liftman didn't let him in
Where does he work?
- Maybe somewhere nearby
And once...
we were standing close by.
The bus was very crowded
Two people got off,
and I got the window seat
He tried to get into
the seat beside me, but...
What happened?
- Someone else took the seat
Everything all right, Pandu?
When did he call me?
- As soon as you arrived
Another boundary!
Late again?
Be on time
Where's Bhatt?
- He has been absent since yesterday
He must've gone to watch
the cricket match
Let me have the statement of accounts
of Bluebird Company
Have you drawn up the statement
of the Bluebird Company?
Stop disturbing!
I'll see it later
There, you got him out
Ever since he was promoted to Grade 2
he thinks no end of himself
Send Arun.
- Arun sahib has left
All right, go
They've no interest in overtime!
- He's young. No knowing...
where he's doing his overtime
White cream? It'll give a good shine.
- Hurry up!
Waiting for long? The buses
aren't on time nowadays
And when they arrive, they stop
ten yards too short
What are you doing this evening?
Don't tell you have no time
A nice movie is running at Eros.
Let's watch it
I'll come to your office
at five. All right?
Come in queue.
- We're together
We'll have tea at Gaylord's,
then we'll go to the movie
Two to Fountain
Arun, have you fallen asleep in there?
Hurry! Even I have to get to office
Coming
What's the time?
Nine twenty.
- What?
Nine twenty
Today was fun. He stood next to me
in the queue, and he was squirming
I thought, why not needle him?
So I just asked him the time
He looked at me as if
I was holding a gun on him
Like it happens in films.
- I feel sorry for him
Yes, he's a nice sort. But every time
I see him, I feel like teasing him
And nowadays, he even accompanies me
right upto my house
Jokes apart, I hope
this doesn't turn a problem
Sahib, we're working overtime today.
- I haven't the time
Who was that Prabha?
- He keeps tailing me
Why don't you complain?
- I will
Where's Jackson Tolaram?
- 2nd floor
Excuse me, whom would you
like to see in Jackson?
General Manager
What work do you have
with the General Manager?
Listen, I'm not a hoodlum.
You must be mistaken
Yes, yesterday I did follow you
from the bus stop. But...
What...?
- Please don't get me wrong
Where's the General Manager's room?
- Over there
It'll be too bad if you report this.
You see, I'm always late. Believe me
You can see my character certificate.
I'm not a bad person
Who's that?
- I don't know, sir
He keeps following me day in,
day out. I'm here to complain to you
If he persists, I'll report him
to the police. Shameless!
What is this I hear? This not only
gives you a bad name...
it also gives us a bad name.
You must apologise immediately...
and you must promise never to do this.
- Apologise for what?
Is loving someone a crime?
Yes, I love Prabha
Didn't Mr Nambiar fall in love
with the woman he has married?
Didn't Mr Parikh fall in love with
Ms Hansa right here?
And you and Mrs Daruwalla...
I can suspend you right now for
misconduct and gross insubordination
The boss has called you
One of their consignments seem to have
arrived. But our invoices haven't come
Please see where their papers are.
- I have sent them already
It might be lying
in the despatch section
Let her have the copies
Please go with him, Ms Prabha.
I regret the delay
Your eyes, my love...
have stolen my heart
My eyes aren't thieves
You must've lost your heart, my love
Pull down the barriers
between our hearts
What's your problem?
Let our hearts meet
We've just met
Are you raring already?
Wait a while
This wait has killed
so many seasons of Spring
Your eyes, my love...
have stolen my heart
My eyes aren't thieves
You must've lost your heart, my love
You're always tagging along;
you're always hovering around
And I know what's on your mind.
- All your fault
Every day and all the time,
you're making false promises
Don't you know you madman? Do you
expect me to show how eager I am?
I won't trouble you anymore.
Just tell me, how long...
will you go on making me pine?
- Don't you lose heart
The rainclouds will rain someday
What good will rains do...
once the blossoms have wilted
and the elegy is sung?
Your eyes, my love...
have stolen my heart
My eyes aren't thieves
You must've lost your heart, my love
Scoundrel!
You're looking glad.
Did you see him again?
I meet him everyday.
But today, in the bus...
he managed to get a seat beside me.
- Then you must've chatted a lot?
He was in a cold sweat.
- Why didn't you speak to him?
How could I have spoken?
But your plan worked
Yesterday I went to his office,
to ask for the consignment
He thought I was about
to complain to him
And afterwards, you didn't talk?
- Just a few words
But yesterday, he was in bad shape.
He wanted to show me...
his character certificate!
Said he isn't the bad sort
Anyway, so what if you didn't
speak to him? All you talk of is him
Do you know what this indicates?
- Indicates what?
You want me to spell it out?
- No!
I know you're Prabha Narayan.
And you live in Ninth Lane Khar
3rd floor, Shyam Niwas.
- How long have you been after me?
On the bus you keep reading
Denise Robbins. Romantic novels
Have your tea before it gets cold.
- Last Wednesday, you wore pink
Last Friday, green. You always wear
light hues; your bag is always white
You always cross your legs
while sitting
And you've grown the nail on that
little finger on your right hand
Not having your tea? It's getting
cold. Arun, what's on your mind?
Have you ever held a girl's hand?
- That's on your mind?
How does one hold a girl's hand?
- Like this
You haven't reached the hand yet?
You have a long way to go!
Did you receive your consignment?
- Which one?
You came to my office asking for it.
- Yes... must've reached
I saw a movie at Eros the day before.
Have you seen it?
The bus comes late nowadays
Sorry, what did you say?
Back from the holidays?
- I'm joining work today
Going to the office?
- Yes
Come, join me
Come on
Come on, hurry up
Yes?
- This is important
Can you come for lunch?
No, I'll tell you when we meet
At Samovar. One o'clock
Yes, I'll be there
Be there at one.
There might be a crowd
Hey mister, a fifty
Come on, this is funny!
What's it?
- He telephoned...
to ask me out for lunch.
- Are you going?
Should I?
- Won't you, if I were to say no?
Even Nagesh is back at work
If Arun asks something embarrassing,
or if he holds my hand...?
Don't be nervous. Your Arun
won't make any such mistake
Arun is a gentleman. You told me so.
But I know what you're thinking
What use being a gentleman?
- Forget it!
I'm not going for the lunch.
- Don't go
What are you doing here?
Sit, have some lunch
I'm sitting there
Let me give you company
Arun is with Jackson Tolaram.
Nagesh is in our law department
What would you like?
- Excuse me. Let me fix this
Make us a special dish.
Is Peter in the kitchen?
Tell him it's Nagesh sahib's order.
You'll ask him to cook it well, right?
Done well.
- Tell him it's Nagesh sahib's order!
He'll know
What do we order?
Chicken Alapurz. 3 plates
You like yoghurt dips?
Prabha digs it
3 plates
Bread stuffed with mincemeat.
Rice boiled, okay?
And... nothing else. Make it fast.
Or no tip
Are you ill?
No
Have you read today's circular?
The matches are staring from the 15th
During the holiday, all I did
was to practice table tennis
I've named you my partner
for the mixed doubles
You start practice from tomorrow
But I'm out of practice
- I'm with you
Do you play table tennis?
- Did a bit in my college days
Enough! In college I was a cricketer.
Opening batsman and pace bowler
I taught Sunil the stances
What to say? I started working,
and everything went haywire
Prabha, tell him...
Running champion for two years.
Table tennis and chess
You didn't get the bread?
- Coming up right now
You know what that bald fool told me?
- That's our General Manager
But he's a very nice guy.
- Very nice, my foot
Nice maybe, for the female staff
Eat, please.
What's your name... I forget
Yes, Arun
Two o'clock! Hurry up.
- Goodness!
Two already?
- The bald fool will be growling
Prabha, let him join us for practice.
- Do come. We practise at...
Churchgate Gymkhana.
- What time?
Not today! Have you forgotten?
Today is the chess match
Don't worry. I have the scooter.
I'll drop you
Join us for practice tomorrow.
Thanks for the lunch
Arun Pradeep failed to win
Prabha's love
At 1:55 on the afternoon of October 7,
in front of Jehangir Art Gallery...
motivated by vengeance, he shot
at his rival Nagesh Shastri...
using a Smith and Wesson revolver
from a distance of four feet
The victim died on the spot.
The accused committed the murder...
in cold blood, in broad daylight,
and he should be sentenced to death
On the morning of October 6,
the accused was hurt in a car accident
The wound on his right arm
has not yet healed
The civil surgeon's certificate
has been lodged as an exhibit
The prosecution's charge that the
accused shot Nagesh Shastri, from...
a distance of four feet is untenable.
- I would like to make a statement
Go on
Using a Smith and Wesson,
or any other revolver...
I can shoot someone even with my
left arm from a distance of 200 feet
What have you done?
You have scuttled your own case!
What have you done Arun?
What is going to happen to me now?
What a racket! Is this
any place to play?
What are you doing?
At least, let me eat in peace
You know, no place for
a third on the scooter
Do come over to watch the practice
this evening. Prabha and I are...
playing doubles. Like to come?
See you
Shall we?
- Yes
My motorcycle has been lying for
6 months. Is there a buyer, or not?
Who's going to buy it? I tell you,
sell it to a junk dealer
You'll get 500 or 600.
- We've sold worse
Lots of fools in Bombay. Someone
or the other will fall for it
Someone is reading the notice.
- Really?
Get lost! Go on
No knowing when a customer
might walk in
Wait, keep this money. 1,000.
Make sure you return it to me!
You have a scooter for sale?
- Looking for a scooter?
Come on, I'll show you
Here A-one stuff
The scooter I saw yesterday
... is it ready?
Have you got the cash?
- Yes, I'm here to take delivery
Go on
Yes?
This thing looks great.
Say, do we take it?
Yes, it looks sturdy.
Ask him
Yesterday, you didn't show me
this motorcycle. Is it for sale?
You want it? It just came in
this morning
Abdul, tell Gurnam that
a buyer is here
Take it sahib. Not too costly
They want that motorcycle.
Have a chat
Sahib, the tyres are new.
Take a look
For 25 years, it has been with me.
I'm selling it because I need the cash
Else, who sells such a fine thing?
- Can I test the start?
Test-drive it. Original British stuff.
Every part of it, a diamond
Peter, I say let's buy this
motorcycle. What's a scooter?
Yes sahib, want the scooter?
- What does it cost?
Who can pay a price for this?
But for 4,000 I'll let it go
I say, let's take it. It's a bit
pricey. But you don't find this stuff
All right. Will you settle for 2,500?
- Not 2,500. 3,000. Final
I'm selling you a piece of my heart,
I swear! What to do? I'm in a fix
Not bad for three, I guess. Take it.
- Done?
Okay, enjoy yourself. Three. Done.
- Out with the money
1,000. The rest in 2 instalments.
- What instalment?
I'm selling it so cheap because
I need the cash. I want 3,000 cash
But we agreed over the 3 instalments.
- For the scooter. Take it
Where do I find 3,000?
- Try. You might be able to raise it
What does this cost?
- You want this?
If they won't take it, I will.
- What's a scooter? Take the bike
What a buy! You'll always wonder!
- We're losing the deal
Forget it, I haven't the money
Keep this.
- No, first start it. Satisfy yourself
No, it's all right.
- No sahib. First take a look
Pinto, roll it off the stand.
The documents will be done day after
Go on
My commission!
Look, what I bought for you.
Nice, isn't it? You like it?
Why I bought it?
Prabha, you want to know the truth?
Only for you, Prabha
Prabha, for you I'll buy everything!
I wish I could...
No, not wish. Want.
Want is a nice word
>From tomorrow onwards, I want us
to go to work on our motorcycle
Be there at the bus stop
at 9:20 sharp. I'll...
No! Nagesh gives you a lift
from there, right?
I'll pick you up from your house.
Right? This son of a gun Nagesh...
How come you're here?
What was that soliloquy?
- You won't understand
Whose motorcycle is this?
- I bought it
Really? When did you buy it?
- What for this the everyday hassle?
Long queues, buses, the wait...
Come on. Let's go. Sit
All right
What happened?
Has it broken down?
What happened?
- His motorcycle broke down
Whose is it?
- Mine
Second-hand?
Isn't that from Gurnam's garage?
You bought it from Unique Garage?
Yes, why?
You've been cheated.
How much did you pay?
3,000.
- Three thousand for this?
This isn't worth 300.
Return it. Right now
But what use going there?
You won't find him.
Standing in the middle
of the street is no use
Go to a garage and get it fixed.
Prabha, why keep standing here?
Come with me, come on.
- Go on, you're getting late
I'll take it to a garage.
- Come on Prabha, come on
Poor Arun! What he thinks,
and what happens!
But the question is about
the Jackson-Tolaram legacy of love
Will he be able to uphold tradition?
Will he succeed? And how?
The question is a bit tricky.
But what won't a desperado do?
My Lord, without Prabha, I will die!
You're omniscient. Tell me, what to do?
Lord...
Please say something.
- I told you. He doesn't speak
What is to become of me?
I am so unhappy!
You have made an offering, haven't you?
- Yes
And contributed to the Widows' Home?
- Yes. I have given 101 Rupees
Then everything will be all right.
- But I must know what is to happen
Maybe he can write it down
Do not disturb. Leave.
He wants to rest
I can't read this language.
- He knows only this language
What's written is, Go home as fast as
you can. Everything will be all right
But...
Now leave
Has he left? Hurry up and
get out of your clothes
The movie starts at 3:30!
Have you got the tickets?
- Yes
Two?
- Yes, two
Yes, what do you want?
- I left my handkerchief behind
Then there was news of someone in
Khandala, far from the madding crowd
Julius Nagendra Nath Wilfred Singh
A retired army colonel...
who has seen the world. That's why
big and small, rich and poor...
everyone asks for his advise
about everything
Hearsay has it that 20 years ago...
general manager Batliwala
of Jackson Tolaram...
consulted the Colonel, and ended up
marrying Shireen Daruwalla
Let's see how our Arun fares
Go back
Shut the door
Come here
The other way
Put your umbrella and your bag down
So you opened the door
and let the chickens out?
I didn't know
What is the matter?
- I've come from Bombay
To meet Colonel J.W.N. Singh
- But you haven't an appointment
I haven't one. But this is urgent
I'm Julius Nagendra Nath Wilfred Singh
Shobhna, sit for a while
So you're the one?
Greetings
How did you arrive?
- I followed the arrows
Through the dirt track?
- Yes
That's what I wanted to know.
So this must be a crisis
I haven't done anything.
- You have arrived
Is that any the less?
Most people just go back
That's why I laid the track.
But those who do come...
Baby, get the secretary...
The secretary is a moron.
If the case is critical...
he gives you an appointment
after three days
Get over to the billiards room
in an hour. Tell him I called you
So Shobhna...
- Yes
What was I saying?
- You were saying... yes
Life has to be turned around
Life has to be turned around,
and it's an art you should learn
Today's mail
There's a candidate too.
- What candidate?
He says you have called him to the
billiards room. He is from Bombay
Did I?
Oh yes, the chickens!
All right, sit
Anything special in the mail?
- Bakhtiyar Bhatia from Bombay...
Bloody smugglers! They come asking
for advice when they land in trouble
The rest are insignificant.
Four from the ministers
Six from erstwhile Princes.
The rest are job-seekers...
some looking for licenses,
some looking for what-not
Why have you grown a stubble?
- I'm coming directly from a shoot
I wanted to discuss something
urgently with you
Would you like to read the letters
from the ministers first?
No, not now. Send it to the office
Send Marilyn over, to take notes
Tell me, what is it?
What's your name?
Arun and Pradeep. Two names?
What's your problem in Bombay?
Not getting a job?
That's not the case.
- If it's about acting in films...
go back. Nothing is going to happen.
- It isn't about acting
Then it must be a girl?
Never mind. I'll help you.
No one else can advise you better
So you can't find a girl?
Can we go on, if you stay mum?
The only son of your parents?
- Yes
You have lived a protected life,
and they have always advised you
Yes, how come you know?
- And now they're dead?
Yes.
- So you can't decide for yourself
How did you meet her?
- In the bus
No, in the queue
No, maybe that day...
yes, in the queue
Is she married or single?
- Single, maybe
Works in an office?
- Yes
Your office?
- No
She knows you?
- Yes
She meets you everyday?
- Yes, no I mean...
I keep trying to see her.
- Where?
On the bus, in the queue...
A contender? Someone standing
in your way?
Yes, that's why...
He works in her office?
- You know everything
And he is better off than you are?
- What?
Does he have a car?
- Has a scooter
You don't have a scooter?
No
What else is special about him?
- Table tennis and chess
And he has barged in?
An L.L.L case.
- What...?
What will you do if you don't
get the girl? Suicide?
Well?
- Yes
How?
- What?
I mean, how will you kill yourself?
Under a train? Off a highrise? Or drown?
Or will you poison yourself?
- I haven't about this matter
No problem. I'll tell you
Lacking in self-confidence
As of now, you needn't kill yourself.
Your replies indicate that...
you have lost the battle in life.
And you've lost the woman you love
What's her name?
- Prabha
What did you say?
- Prabha Narayan
I'll make you successful. But you
will have to stay here for 20 days
Do you have a place hereabouts?
- No
Put him up in the guest house.
You will have to spend
Do you have money?
- Yes
A thousand?
- Yes
I'm glad to see that your face didn't
cloud over at the mention of a thousand
Give me your hand
First lesson. Don't shake hands like
a damp squib. You do it forcefully
Like what?
Lesson two. You will stop scratching
your nose and your head
Hold your head high and look into
a man's eyes while speaking
You get it?
- Got it, sir
One thousand
Give the money to the secretary
Lesson Three. Don't give money to
your seniors. Take from them
What...?
- This I shall explain later
Human beings were divided in two
at the beginning of creation
Do you know?
- Yes, man and woman
One is down beside the lake, one
under that tree, for the third...
you will have to climb
the hillock. Go
Man and woman? No, I was talking
of another divide
This dichotomy is
of great significance
It is the divide between
winners and losers...
between the ones above
and the ones down under
If you don't belong up there,
you belong down there
In the game that is life,
there are no draws
You either win, or you lose.
And the winner...
is right on top. And the ones
on top, aren't the ones down under
Got it?
- Yes
You haven't got a thing! Even I didn't
understand what I was saying
Tell me the truth. Do you,
or don't you understand?
Lesson five. If you don't understand
something, say it. Understand? Eat
Oh why...?
Why is this happening to me?
Why does the heart miss
someone so suddenly?
These little takes, oh why?
Those awkward moments
of meeting a stranger...
are gone. Today, in many hues
he torments my heart
Oh why, that awkwardness in moments
when I met yesterday's stranger?
Oh why, today these shades of blue
torment my heart?
Oh, such strange moments
Before I have dreamt my dream...
The palace I dreamt of
has shattered
Oh why...
Oh why is this happening
to my life?
Why does the heart miss
someone so suddenly?
These little takes, oh why?
I stand on the same road...
I am taking the same journey
But I haven't with me,
my fellow traveller
My eyes seek everywhere on the
same road; the journey is the same
But my fellow-traveller
is not with me
My eyes seek... upon the same road
Oh where are gone,
those evenings of ecstasy?
Oh where are gone,
my days when he was mine?
Oh why...
Oh why is this happening
to my life?
Why does the heart miss
someone so suddenly?
These little takes, oh why?
Time was when, like you,
I too was in love
Look at this. I loved her so much,
I never imagined she wouldn't be mine
But I didn't get her.
- Why?
My foolishness. Anyway,
forget those old tales
Your training is over.
Tomorrow, you leave
Don't be foolish enough to lose
in love, like I did
This I expect from a young man
like you. Remember one thing
In love, nothing is unfair
And Arun, I have begun to take
a special liking for you
You know why?
- No
Were you dumb, like me?
Not that. Today I have the money,
the mansions, the respectability...
and yet I have nothing. Guess why?
- Why?
Because I don't have my Prabha
Yes Arun. She's the one, whom I miss.
And I have everything, yet nothing
Her name was Prabha too.
Well, so I didn't get Prabha
But I have always tried to bring
man and woman together
I'm travelling with you to Bombay
on business. And I'll also see...
how you capitalise on my training
Where have you been?
- Away on work
You didn't even inform me.
- So Nagesh, what's happening?
Prabha and I won the doubles.
- Really?
Prabha, I'll wait for you ahead
Go on
Looks like Arun is back.
- Yes
Will you say something?
- Today Nagesh...
Finish laughing. We'll talk afterwards.
- Listen!
Holiday over?
Stand up and wish me
Say it
What happened?
What is the matter?
Why are you screaming
Give me the Bluebird statements.
- Not ready yet
What have you been doing?
It's all wrong
I'll be back
Add it up
But I checked it.
- Then how did this happen?
I'll correct it,
and I'll bring it back
Forget it. I'll do it.
Get me the register
In whatever condition it is,
I want to check it
Won't you check it?
- Get the statements first
The statements aren't ready yet.
In a day or two...
I want all the statements ready
tomorrow. Work overtime if need be
I'll do it.
- I'll do it, sir
Sahib, someone is here to see you
Keep this money. Enjoy yourself.
And don't you ever get smart with me
Never!
Send the gentleman in.
- Yes sir
All this has to be typed today.
Why aren't these statements ready yet?
You're going to work tonight
till it's over, get it? Go
I won't move your leave application
until the Bluebird job is done
And you... why are you staring at me?
Get me a cup of tea
Have you sent someone to the garage?
- My room-mate is going there tomorrow
I hear there's an old motorcycle
for sale. Can you show me?
Sold.
- Sold? 1925 make...?
British-made? Royal Enfield?
- Yes, I sold it
For how much?
- 3,000
Who was he?
- Some crazy fellow. Get to work
Who's Arun?
Fine
What?
Prabha is coming too?
No, I'll bring her along
No, I'll come on my own
Who is this?
Let me see
Arun on the line.
- Give me
Fixed?
Who's Samovar?
I'll be there
Please take a seat.
- It's all right
Look, inside her womb, this woman
has an elephant, a bird inside
This is Prabha. She works
for Frank and Lloyd
This is Colonel Singh.
- And I work nowhere
How is your work going on?
- Fine
And how is your work going on?
- Which work?
Apart from work at home, and work at
office, could there be any other work?
Prabha, let me reserve a table.
Please keep each other company
Get back soon
Yes?
- Lovely name
How long have you known Arun?
- Just a while
How do you find him? I like him.
- He's nice
I wanted to know whether
you like him or not
Let's go to the restaurant.
We'll find a place
Which means that you don't like him?
- No, that's not the case
You like him, and you don't like him?
Is it that tough a question
Shall I tell you something?
Your name reminds me of another Prabha
She was in love with a boy.
But they never got together in life
Why couldn't they get together?
- They should've got together, no?
Yes, if their love was true.
- That's what I wanted to hear from you
Here comes Arun. Got the table?
- Yes. Let's go
Do you need me?
- What?
I want to take a look at
the paintings. You go on
Come
Prabha, where have you been?
I wanted to bring you along
Arun, you ask me to get Prabha along,
and here you are, with her
Prabha wanted to do some shopping.
I thought I'd give her company
Shopping for what?
- What women shop for...
can't always be made public
What are we eating? Nagesh,
why don't you lunch with us?
Is Peter in the kitchen? Tell him
this is Mr Nagesh's order. What?
Peter has quit.
- What? Well, whoever it is...
ask him to make it well.
3 chicken Alapurz, and...
We don't make French dishes anymore.
- What...?
Let's try Chinese today.
- Yes, let's go
Peter has quit?
No more Chicken Alapurz?
How was that?
- A la grande
Now we're going for Chinese.
- Where?
Flora.
- Wait! Forgot D'souza? He lied for you
Five for you.
And give Peter five
Would you like something?
- Of course. Chicken Alapurz
One chicken Alapurz, and ask Peter
to do it well
Today!
The flowers are blossoming
My dreams are hues of gold
Every morning dawns golden
Every evening is a splash of red
Your fragrance touches
the breeze, touches you...
makes me ecstatic
My heart flies...
to a meeting in the skies
Open your heart to the colours
in your priceless dreams
At chess, Nagesh is unbeatable.
- Why is Arun taking on Nagesh?
That's a great move. You win.
- Play on. This is just my 3rd move
And I haven't checkmated you yet.
- What use playing?
I can see it clearly. At move 7,
you will take my knight
Move 8, I take your pawn.
In moves 13 and 14, I lose my bishops
Yes, I can take that knight of yours.
In move 17... no, on move 19...
you check me. Move 20, mate.
In the 1970 internationals...
Grand Master Klotozov played
exactly this game
Yes?
You have a 1925 Royal Enfield for sale?
- Sold
When?
- A month and a half ago
How much did you sell it for?
- 3,000
Why?
- I'm willing to pay 6,000 for it
You need it?
- Can you find the man you sold it to?
Yes
Keep 500. Advance. Find out,
and get back to me at this address
The paint-chrome job is over.
But it will run for a mile at most
All I want is half a mile out of it.
Here you are
Luck is when the fish walks
into the net! Get lost
I was passing by. I thought I'd drop by
to congratulate you. You deserve it too
Congratulations? What for?
- It won the Pune Cantonment races
It won?
- Didn't you read it in The Times?
When you sold it, you didn't say
it runs only on 93 octane...
and for every five litres of gas,
it burns up a litre of lube
Only after I went through
the manual, I found out...
that a jet was missing from the
carburettor. At last...
I found one at Pune. Imported parts
aren't available everywhere
Sorry if you have been inconvenienced
unnecessarily. We'll buy it back
In Pune, Colonel Singh was persistent.
He asked me where I found it
What name did you say?
- Julius Nagendra Nath Wilfred Singh
Sit, please be seated.
Abdul, get a cold drink
Have you sold it to the Colonel?
- Why should I?
The world over, there are
only six of these left
A company in London is looking for
this model for an exhibition
They don't even have one.
So they advertised...
in all the papers all over the world.
You must've read it
Sahib, I'm an illiterate.
I sold it because I needed the cash
How would I know? I never even took
a look at it in three years...
What was that about 3 years?
- Forget it sahib
Give the bike back to me.
- You expect me to do that?
I didn't give it to the Colonel.
- You are rich! By God's grace...
you can buy a new one!
It's my companion of 25 years
Please give it back to me.
- But...
Let him have it sahib. You are
a gentleman. He was very foolish
I have spent some 800 bucks on it.
- I'll give you 4,000 for it
Cash?
- Yes, right now
He's a moron. All brawn, no brains.
He's going to be grateful for this
Here's 4,000, sahib
On one condition.
- Sure
You will let me ride this bike
whenever a race comes up
A hundred times, yes! Consider
this yours. Please take the money
Won't you count it?
- Not necessary
Shall I call a taxi? Abdul...
- Not necessary. I'll walk
What brings you here?
- Nothing in particular
Don't you touch that.
It isn't for sale
Are you out of your mind?
Will I ever buy this?
What are you looking for?
- Nothing in particular
See you
Here's the 500, you paid at the garage
I could say you're very near to success.
I'm going to Baroda for a couple of days
Another Arun in a fix?
- You could say that
I'm not needed here, am I?
- Take your time
Just a matter of a couple of days.
- Just a couple of days
Let me call a cab for you
One must walk. Brisk walk
is best for health. Get it?
Walking is best
Colonel Julius... etc Singh?
>From Khandala?
Julius Nagendra Nath Wilfred Singh.
- Yes, are you?
Right.
- So you are coaching him?
Coaching him, yes.
But not in letters
Are you the one who's leading him
from the drawing room to the bedroom?
In 3 simple moves.
- Written by David Abraham?
An old friend. What's your problem?
- This is going to be your problem
Really?
- Yes
What's this?
Come Prabha, sit. Sorry to call you
during the lunch break. It's urgent
What's the matter?
- The matter is quite serious
You must stop seeing Arun.
- Why?
He's trying to seduce you.
- What are you saying?
He has learnt all the tricks.
I suspected this when he took us...
to the Chinese restaurant. Being
in love with you is just a sham
The intention is quite something else.
- What else could be the intention?
You don't know why
a man chases a woman?
No seeing him from now on.
- But he has called me this evening
Where to?
- To his house
He doesn't have a house.
- He has one, in Bandra
He's going to use the classic ploy
>From drawing room to bedroom
in three moves
Have you read David Abraham?
- What moves?
There will be no one at home.
Romantic music will be playing
He will treat you to condiments
laced with sedatives
Arun will be smoking.
An ignited matchstick...
will fall on your dress.
You're going to get out of the dress
At which point of time, someone knocks
on the door, and you enter his bedroom
The bedroom will have only one bed.
He walks in...
he makes you sit on the bed'
lights out, and...
Shut up Nagesh. Arun isn't so lowly.
- How am I bothered?
Go on, fall into the trap.
- Of course I'm going
Only to see whether you're
saying the truth
Are you out of your mind? I too
have a responsibility towards you
No, I'm not going to let you go.
- No Nagesh. I will go
Let me see how much he loves me.
But if this is true...
No need to go. Come, let's watch
a movie together
Business in Baroda done?
- Done
Tomorrow, we're leaving.
Business here is over too
I have to meet Arun once.
- Arun had telephoned
He has invited Ms Prabha. Tonight.
- Tonight?
Yes.
- Where?
He has hired a place in Bandra.
- What's his hurry?
I must go!
Do you know where in Bandra?
- I don't quite know
But he gave an address.
- Let me have it
Any problem, sir?
- He's being foolish
Prabha is a nice girl. She loves him,
I'm sure. He needn't use ploys
Should I accompany you, sir?
- No, you stay here
If Arun calls, tell him to do nothing
until I have arrived
Staying here this evening?
What is the matter, Prabha?
- What if Arun does something like...?
What has Arun done?
Let's go
Don't be morose. Come to my place.
My sister has just arrived from Delhi
No, not tonight. I must see Arun.
Maybe for the last time
Won't you tell me?
- Not now. Let me see what he does
No problem finding the house?
- No
How is the place?
- Nice
Have a paan. It's made with
Benares condiments
No, I don't feel like it
Sit Prabha. Why are you standing?
You live here alone?
You know very well, I'm not married.
- I mean, no one else lives here?
As of now, no one
That act of being in love is a sham,
intent being something quite different
What is the matter? Why are you
so silent? Do have a paan
I'm not silent. Why don't you sit?
Since when have you started smoking?
- I smoke sometimes. When I'm alone
You aren't alone now, aren't you?
Why, who else is here?
Arun will be smoking. An ignited
matchstick will fall on your dress
Surprised?
Why did you have to do all this?
Don't you have faith in me?
I don't know why, but I was
always afraid about losing you
You could've asked me at least.
- Had I the courage to ask...
For something as trivial...
See who it is
No one need come now
Why have you come here?
- I'm going to send you both to jail!
Later! Now get out of here!
- No! First I'm going inside!
There you are!
Why didn't you come to Metro?
Look, here are the tickets
Did Arun seduce you?
Rogue! Look at Prabha ever again,
and I'm going to flay you alive!
No need to worry. I'm with you.
Come on
I'm not worried. And you needn't
be here. Get it?
We have decided to get married
Now I can rest assured.
- You shut up!
Prabha, what are you saying?
All these are ploys. Foisted by him!
This is a lie! I'm going to send
the two of them to jail! You'll see
By all means. But must you intrude
into such delicate moments?
You have two tickets to the theatre.
Let's watch the movie
As for them, they've taken a decision.
- What decision? Why don't you say...
all this is a ruse you've worked?
- Not ruse, son. This is art
You can call it philosophy, or science.
- Science? Bullshit! Just ploys...
to seduce innocent girls!
The two of them are together...
thanks to your ploys. And you are
the one who will separate them now
Who can separate them? Their love
is true, they are sincere
They don't need my art,
they don't need my ploys
I only show the light
to the blind
But where there is light,
my little lamp is of no use
After the wedding, make sure
you bring Prabha over to my place
And son... the art of getting
a grip on your life...
What?
- You won't get to know through letters
Take a month off. Come to live with me.
You'll surely find another Prabha
Arun too upheld the legacy
of Jackson Tolaram
They married
After the wedding, in accordance
with the Colonel's wishes...
Mr and Mrs Arun Pradeep travelled
to Khandala to meet Colonel sahib
The Colonel blessed them and
he gave them a gift. 1000 Rupees
He returned his fee. When truth shines,
what use are fees and the art?
Who is this?
Yes, it's Nagesh. He has taken
a month's leave. Leave without pay
He's coming to take lessons from
the Colonel sahib
He has a story to tell too.
But that's for later
So Nagesh enlists with the Colonel
Anyway, forget him. As of you should
send them a congratulatory telegram
Number Eight reads: Our best wishes
for a happy marriage forever
