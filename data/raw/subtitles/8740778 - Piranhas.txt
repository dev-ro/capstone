Hanging up in back.
I ironed it.
Thanks.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
We're here for that thing.
How can I pay you every week?
- That's your problem.
- But we're struggling to get by.
You have to pay like everyone else.
Take the keys, too.
Then you can do some work.
- Calm down.
- What are you doing?
I'll take this jacket.
- It belongs to a customer.
- It belongs to me now.

Lollipop, don't you start!
Bro, I m kidding.

Go on.
Ba, ba, ba...
We made it.
- Thank God.
- Let me borrow your phone.
Such a big place.
- It's packed.
- Every Friday it's packed.
- Yeah?
- Is this your first time?
- Where are you?
- I've never been.
We're on our way.
Which line?
That one's for tables.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
Hi, girls.
See you inside?
Yeah.
Hi.
- Yes?
- We want to go in.
The door's over there.
- We're with the girls.
- Yeah.
You're underage,
you can't come in.
Who says we're underage?
We're all over 18.
Have you got any ID?
- ID?
- Are you a cop?
You want to go in?
I'll assign you a table then.
- How much?
- 500 euros.
I've come this far
and I want to go in!
We're stand-up guys.
We wouldn't hurt a fly.
That girl was drop dead gorgeous.
I want to book a table next Friday,
500 euros.
- Where are we going to find 500 euros?
- We will.
- How?
- We just will, I want to get in.
But how?
I don't know.
We'll think of something.
Look who's here!
The Striano brothers?
They don't fucking count no more.
Their dad's corroborating,
their uncle's dead.
Don't let them hear you.
- Who's the girl?
- Dunno.
Giulio, who are you letting in here,
a bunch of jerk offs?
- Get out of here.
- We're just eating.
- You're a Striano!
- So?
Get out of here!
Come on!
Go on!
Kid.
Are you a lesbian,
hanging out with these pansies?
We're available if you want a man.
Don't laugh,
mind your own business.
Giulio, I'll have my usual.
Hotdog and fries.
- And you?
- Hamburger and salad.
Can I say something?
- Go ahead.
- Ignore those assholes.
It was better
when your family was in control.
Who are you?
- Are you the dry cleaner's son?
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you, I'm Nicola.
- Agostino.
I live near you.
You live over Stella?
- Yeah, nearby.
- Really?
- These are my friends.
- Hey..
Want to smoke a joint?
- Do you want a joint?
- Of course.
- Let's go.
- Weed?
Come on.
Don't make a sound.
Nice.
You've got a gym too?
Nice piano.
Can I try this?
Yeah, but check the weight.
I can do it.
Don't make a sound.
- My jacket?
- I'll take it.
Can I try this?
- Know how to turn it on?
- Where?
Here.
It'll do you good.
- Look at this nice lion!
- How's that done?
Amazing eyes.
- Awesome.
- Nice.
- Solid gold.
- Awesome.
This TV is huge.
You've got an amazing home.
- Do you like it?
- It's awesome.
Let me show you something.
- Where are we going?
- Follow me.
This is Uncle Tonino's apartment.
Amazing!
Look at this chandelier!
It's huge!
This is his bedroom.
Is this his bed?
Yeah, the bed
where he recited his poems.
- What?
- Recited his poems.
- Really?
- Want to hear one?
Go on.
"For respect and honor
"so many friends have died.
"When I leave the house
"they're always at my side.
"Mario, Oreste and Pasqualino.
"My brothers in criminal fame.
"And when I carry this gun,
the barrel bears your name."
Tonino Striano.
Who's this?
His right-hand man.
- Really?
- They were always together.
What a great photo.
You can keep it.
- Really?
- Yeah, I want you to have it.
Thanks.
- Want to take a selfie?
- Okay.
Where've you been?
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.
Try me.
The Strianos' building.
The one around back?
Really?
It's an amazing building!
What's it like?
To start with, it's ten times
the size of this place.
Lucky you getting to see it.
- Want to see something?
- Yeah.
- Look.
- Who is he?
- Don't you know?
- No.
It's Tonino Striano,
one of the biggest bosses in Naples.
Everybody's scared of him.
But...
when he was in charge around here,
everyone liked him.
Why?
Because he was the only one
who didn't extort money from shops.
I see.
He never asked 'em for anything.
And he even gave
unemployed kids work.
What happened to him?
They killed him.
Too bad.
I saw these in an ad.
The new Nikes.
180 euro?
- And these?
- 180 too.
Are they originals?
Of course.
Who do you take us for?
Nico!
- Do you like this?
- It's awesome.
How much is it?
Get off,
you're not at home.
What a pain!
Nice!
Biscottino,
look at this great T-shirt!
Don t touch the stuff, please.
- How much is it?
- 200 euros.
200 euros?
Don't leave it there.
Nice jacket.
Do you like it?
Get out!
All of you!
We're not doing anything wrong!
Nico, look, Rolex watches!
They're awesome!
Daytona. The latest model.
How much is it?
15,600 euros.
The blue one?
That's a Datejust.
Blue dial with diamonds.
- How much?
- 5,000 euros.
- Really?
- Wow!
Nico!
- What's up?
- Look at this one!
Awesome.
That's a solid gold Daytona.
Solid gold! Amazing!
I'd look like a badass with this.
- Have you seen the price?
- How much?
- 22,000 euros.
- You don't say!
- You're all talk.
- What?
You got the balls to go in?
- I'd break into a bank.
- Yeah, a bank!
Have you got the balls to go in?
- You'd shit your pants!
- No, I wouldn't!
Are you stupid?
Stop it!
It looks real.
It's nice, though.
You don't scare anyone
with the plug in.
Give me a chance.
Nico!
Ciro and his sister.
- Where are they?
- Are you blind?
That's better.
Ciro!
Well?
She said she'll do it.
But you have to take me dancing
and pay me.
- Pay you?
- I won't get in trouble for you.
We'll see.
Let's go.
Here.
Open the display case.
That one.
Give me the necklaces.
That one.
The watches.
Move it!
Come on!
Not you!
- Go on!
- My sister!
- Forget her!
- My sister!
Go on!
Go on!
Here are the brats.
Hand over the stuff,
and don't you dare screw up
again in this neighborhood.
We're sorry.
- It's all there.
- That's what you say.
- That s my phone!
- Hold him down.
Any more watches in your pocket?
Is it all there?
It's all here.
Thanks.
Can I say something?
We need money.
We need a job.
Look who he took a selfie with.
Are you friends?
Striano's a rat.
He lives near me.
No, guys, hold it.
Leave them be.
So you want a job?
- Yeah.
- You got buddies?
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Show me those things.
Come here.
See?
Is this all yours?
Is it weed?
- Our plantations in Brazil.
- Brazil?
- Like it?
- Awesome.
If you behave,
and you keep away
from those rogues the Strianos,
you can sell weed outside
the university.
- Really?
- You'll make real money.
But if you act like assholes,
I'll have you beaten up.
Don't worry.
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.
Now get out of here,
and don't bust our asses.
Here.
Who are you?
Is Agostino in?
Who are you?
A friend of his.
He's sleeping.
Can't you wake him up?
I don't know you.
I'm a friend.
He's sleeping.
- I can't wake him up.
- It's important.
- Please.
- I've never seen you before.
Let him in.
Should I let him in?
Good morning.
Hi, Agostino.
Listen.
I need some kind of work.
I can't sit around.
Want to work for those guys?
Become one of them?
Give me a job then.
With your family.
My family?
We don't count anymore.
We're nobodies.
What else can I do?
I can't help it.
I have no choice.
You have no choice?
- No.
- Then get out of here.
Do you mean that?
You'd better go.
Don't look at me.
Get out.
Understand?
Get out.
Hurry up.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Three packets,
take them to Bar Nazionale
and get the money.
Busy working, huh?
- If you say so!
- Lucky you.
Here's 3,000 euros.
We'll be quick.
That's fine.
Hi.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
This is my share.
Good.
- Are these the boys?
- Yes.
Good evening.
Come in.
This is 100 grams.
Watch how you cut it.
You see?
They have to be the same size.
Three grams.
Check.
I've been cutting weed
for thirty years.
Look at this callus.
Touch it.
- It's hard.
- Horrible.
Disgusting.
You have to get
30 three-gram pieces from this.
Full three grams at first.
Then you can reduce it
to 2.7, or 2.8.
Then you can get
34 or 35 out of it.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
What did he say?
I'll tell you later.
Listen to him.
He's the best in Naples.
Don't worry.
Cut me a three-gram piece.
Let me see if you're any good.
One at a time.
You first.
Weigh it.
3.87 grams.
Too big, an extra gram.
It has to be three.
You try.
3.27.
Still too big.
Be more careful.
You'll be in the area
around the "Orientale."
It's crawling with students.
Word gets around.
Students bring their friends.
Okay.
Boy...
If anything happens,
we'll blame you.
Don't worry.
Can I ask you something?
Seeing we work with you now,
can you stop taking protection
money from my mom?
We'll see how it goes
and talk again next month.
Okay, thanks.
Have you ever snorted coke?
No.
Let's see how good you are.
Here.
Who's going first?
You start, Lollipop.
You do it, Biscottino.
Okay, guys.
Don't laugh, boys.
How is it?
Is it bitter?
Be careful.
I'll snort it all.
Go on.
You bastard.
Hey, Briatore!
Briatore sniffed half a dose.
Look at Tyson!
What's so funny?
This girl's really cute!
- That one?
- The one in the middle. See?
Pretty, huh?
Marriage material.
Biscottino, do you like her?
She's pretty.
20's worth of weed.
I brought a friend,
give me a bonus.
- Don't worry. Are we clear?
- All clear.
Here, and something extra.
Bye.
Come here, Biscottino.
- Give Biscottino some money.
- What's up?
Give him some money.
See that boy?
Find out if he's selling something.
You stay where you are.
We'll wait here.
He's a pusher.
That fucking idiot!
Who are you?
- Why are you here?
- I'm working. Who are you?
This is my turf.
I'm from Ponticelli,
I belong to don Vittorio.
Don Vittorio!
Don Vittorio's gone gaga!
- He's a nobody.
- He's got no authority.
He still shoves his prick
in your mouth.
What? You shit, I'll kill you!
Don't make a fuss.
Get on this scooter
and get out of here.
I never want to see you again.
- Go away!
- Move!
- Piece of shit!
- Fucking asshole!
Put a prick in your mouth!
- Have you got these in black?
- Yes.
- Size 43?
- Of course!
I want a small in this.
- Have you got the money?
- Look, we're loaded.
Babe, you're wrong.
- Hot bod!
- Dear boy.
Look at this cobra!
It's awesome.
That black T-shirt with
the feathers I saw last time...
- That's it, good.
- Yeah.
- What size?
- A medium.
- Here.
- Great.
Give it to me.
I've got three T-shirts,
a jacket, and a pair of sneakers.
That's 500.
I've got 450.
One, two, three, four
and 50, here.
I like this shop.
You've got nice stuff.
Can you add it up?
500 euros.
How much is this cologne?
Danilo Paura jeans and the red Nikes.
350.
- Hi there.
- Hi, guys.
We want a table.
Have you got the money?
We're loaded,
just name the price.
I want some bottles too.
A load of bottles.
Good evening.
- Pretty!
- Lovely back.
- Go on!
- What's so funny?
You're still a kid!
She's really pretty.
- Table?
- A table for Fiorillo!
I can hear the music!
What's going on?
There's a catwalk.
Where do we go?
Is there no dancing tonight?
I don't know.
Number 11, Letizia Russo.
age 16, from Quartieri Spagnoli.
It's the girl we met last time!
See?
You've got the hots for her.
She's killing me.
Have you seen the Madonna?
Ask her for a date later.
Yeah, I'll talk to her, I swear.
Yeah, I bet.
Look how pretty this one is.
Friends, it's time to find out
who tonight's winner is.
The winner of
Miss Vesuvius Joia 2018.
But first let's find out
who the three finalists are.
They are...
Which do you like?
Number five, nine and eleven!
Eleven!
- Number nine is gonna win.
- No, Letizia's gotta win.
Letizia has to win.
Look at number nine.
She's got a nice face and figure.
She's got everything.
Listen carefully,
because only one of you
will be the winner tonight.
And that is number...
Five, Dafne Corvino!
I don't believe it!
The ugliest one won!
- Assholes!
- The judges prefer the dog!
They didn't choose Letizia,
they chose the dog instead!
A round of applause!
She must have connections!
Instead of the prettiest,
they picked the ugliest.
Letizia's gorgeous!
Look at her!
I told you it was fixed.
- Never mind.
- Say goodbye to your friends.
- I'll wait outside.
- Bye, Auntie. Bye, Uncle.
You should've won.
I only did it for my Dad.
She must have connections.
You're 10,000 times prettier.
- What are you doing now?
- Changing and going home.
You're leaving?
You didn't come Friday?
They wouldn't let the little one in.
- So you stayed outside?
- I had no choice.
- I'll get changed.
- You're not staying?
- See you.
- Yeah.
I'll get changed.
Hi.
Did you see that
the toilet bowl brush won?
- What?
- The toilet brush.
You've got a face like a monkey!
Toilet brush!
Get off her!
Out of the way!
What are you doing?
Shut up and get out!
Go! Go!
Everyone out of here!
Rinse your face!
Hey, that's her dad's restaurant.
- That one?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- I asked, her scooter's outside.
You're right, that's her scooter.
You're a genius!
Nicola's in love.
His eyes are heart-shaped.
They are.
"I love you! I love you!"
Leave him alone, he's in love.
Get out of here.
Go and call Letizia.
Can you come outside a sec?
Come outside.
Come here.
Come on.
Do you like your scooter?
It'll take off.
What do you want?
- I want to be with you.
- We don't know each other.
- Precisely! I want to.
- What is it you want?
To go out on Friday.
- Where to?
- It's a surprise.
- I'm not telling you.
- We'll see then.
- See what?
- If I'm busy.
- Busy?
- Doing what?
I don't know, we'll see.
- Are you going out?
- I don't know.
You're busy doing one thing.
You're coming with me.
- Here.
- What?
Let go of it.
It's beautiful!
- Have you ever been here before?
- No. You?
Never.
Feel it.
- It's soft, eh?
- Nice.
- Uncle!
- Everything okay?
Yes, everything's fine.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I brought the boy.
- Good evening.
- Hi.
What do you think?
It's a bit tight across his stomach.
We'll have to let it out.
It is a little tight.
The kid's got a little bit of a tummy.
Well?
1,600.
Here, count it.
It's all here.
Where should I put it?
On the dresser.
I'll put it here.
- Shouldn't we go then?
- Wait.
Do you have something to say?
You said if we did a good job
you wouldn't ask my mom
for any more protection money.
Is that what we said?
Yes.
It's a little tight.
Yeah, on the shoulders.
You'll have to take it out.
Okay.
Seeing you're doing a good job,
we won't call in at his mom's again.
Okay.
You have to do something for me.
Tell your friends I'm taking you out
to a nice restaurant.
A restaurant?
And I'll get you all a suit.
- Are you happy?
- Of course.
- You can go now.
- Thank you. Bye.
Look who's there!
The Puma!
Wow!
And the Chinese guy with his wife,
Immacolata.
Look over there.
- Enzuccio Boom Boom.
- Yeah.
- And the American.
- Where?
Over there.
The American's awesome!
And the fat dude!
- Who is he?
- They call him Cyclone.
Is that Cyclone?
That's...
Tonino the Savage.
Totore! Totore the Savage!
He looks like a pig.
They're all here tonight.
It's time!
They're about to enter the room.
Here they are!
Let's have a round of applause
for the newlyweds.
Congratulations!
Let's give it up for them!
Everyone, clap your hands!
Louder!
Congratulations!
And another round of applause,
this time for the staff.
Who will delight us with...
these tasty dishes.
Look, how choreographed they are!
So we wish you a wonderful day!
Bon appétit, everyone!
Congratulations to the newlyweds!
Mr. Lino would like to say something.
Thank you.
It's nice to see you all here.
It warms my heart!
We are here
to celebrate the wedding
of my niece Gioia and Marco.
That's right.
Two young people
who have finally decided
to make their dream come true.
There's someone missing today.
Someone who couldn't be with us.
But he soon will.
And we'll welcome him with open arms.
Now let's have some fun
because this is our celebration.
Let's dance,
sing and get drunk
and trample over everybody
who doesn't wish us well!
Music!
Good evening, everyone.
Congratulations, newlyweds!
Witnesses, parents, everyone!
Raise your hands!
Are you going to join us?
Raise your hands!
Come up to the floor
and join the bride and groom.
Raise your hands!
Stop the music!
Everyone back to your seats.
This is just a routine check.
You too, keep still.
Go back to your tables.
Keep calm.
Back to your seats.
Stay calm.
Stay calm.
Sarnataro, come with us.
Stay calm!
Calm down!
Don't you worry!
Stay calm.
Keep on celebrating.
Don t worry.
Keep on celebrating.
A round of applause for the inspector.
He wants to be
in tomorrow's newspapers.
They've arrested them!
Mom, come and celebrate!
Up yours!
Have you got
that thing ready, Arturo?
Well done.
Collect from the stands.
- How much do they owe?
- 20 euros.
- 20 euros for this stand.
- 20 euros.
20 euros for this stand.
Listen...
20 euros for this stand.
I'm broke.
I haven't sold anything today.
You won't pay up?
I will, but I haven't made
anything today.
Then get your stand out of here.
Vacant spot here, who wants it?
Wait.
See what happens?
- Come on!
- It's all I've got.
Here.
Collect from the others,
they all have to pay.
200 euros.
20 euros for this stand.
What do you want?
Well?
We need to talk.
So talk.
Can we go upstairs?
You walk ahead.
There're only three morons left
in the 'hood.
I know.
Sit!
So let's take over.
The two of us.
We just have to shoot at their feet
and they'll run away.
You need guns to take over
a neighborhood.
And we don't have any.
It's really easy to get a gun.
It'll take us a second.
Are you serious?
I'm serious.
Know who's left here?
That skinny one
with the crooked nose.
The fat one,
that pile of shit.
And the short,
cross-eyed one.
We'll eat them for dinner.
They're here.
Don't move.
- Fuck!
- Germano, Germano!
Boys!
Get out of here!
Can't we finish our game?
Move it over there
if you want to finish your game.
Go and play somewhere else.
Come on, let's go!
Who'll shoot it first?
- You first.
- Me?
It doesn't work.
Take the safety off.
You do it.
- You do it.
- Okay.
Close.
Let me try.
Great!
- What are you doing?
- Look at this.
- Wow.
- What're you doin'?
Be careful, idiot!
Let me see.
- Want to see how it works?
- Yeah.
Right...
This is the magazine,
- with the bullets.
- Nice.
You load it here.
- And you fire from here.
- Great.
Why do you need it?
For my job.
- Can I come, too?
- To work with me?
- You're crazy!
- Please!
- You're too young.
- Please!
Go to bed.
I love this sofa!
Let's take a selfie.
Move your head.
- Wow, we're awesome.
- Let me see.
Here are the keys,
hand them round.
Let me see.
Can I see?
Pass it over.
We're gonna kick out
those last three morons.
You've seen it,
so hand it over.
Donna Concetta, watch over us.
Carminiello!
It's jammed! Let's go!
Well?
- We screwed up.
- What happened?
The gun jammed.
What do you mean?
They'll kill us now.
We have to go and apologize.
No way!
We can't do that.
You wanted to kick 'em out
with a gun?
Stay out of this.
You were sitting on the couch
watching TV.
- Let's stay calm.
- Get lost!
Yeah, stay calm.
Give me that hoodie.
Where are you going?
Wait, I want to talk.
I want to talk to you!
I just want to talk to you.
Take me to don Vittorio.
- Why should I?
- Because I said so.
Or we'll make you pay.
Did he fall asleep?
It sure looked like it.
Hi, Aucelluzzo.
Good evening.
Good evening, don Vittorio.
- Get undressed.
- What do you mean?
Don't waste our time,
get undressed.
Don't worry,
you won't catch cold.
- Okay?
- Naked.
I came here because we have
the same enemies.
We want to take over
the Sanità neighborhood.
Playing Monopoly?
Not at all!
The town belongs to the locals.
We have to kick them out.
You've sat down.
- Are you comfortable there?
- Yes.
Then talk.
Let's be honest.
You're under house arrest
so you can't move.
I'm on the outside.
You have guns, but no men.
I have men,
but no guns.
You have to supply them.
I forgot you had men.
But why should I hand over
guns to you?
Then you can work in our area
without any trouble.
And put fucking kids in charge?
Get dressed and get out.
- Are you sure?
- Get out!
I'll go then.
But if you don't give us guns,
you'll have eight deaths
on your conscience.
How old are you?
15.
Why don't you
learn to play football?
Those guys are rich.
I was never any good at football.
See you later.
Kid!
I'll give you what you need.
- But don't screw up.
- Thanks.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Sorry.
Awesome!
Look at this.
Let me see.
- Damn!
- An M-12?
- Don't you like it?
- It's awesome!
Scary.
That s awesome.
Give me the magazine.
It's easy.
Cool.
Ready?
Light it.
Carminiello, get out
out of this neighborhood!
Get out!
On your knees.
- Don't kill me.
- Now!
Asshole!
You bastard!
That s our turf.
Give me that jacket!
Moron!
This is our turf now.
If I see you here again,
I'll kill you.
There he is.
Good morning.
What is it?
I want to tell you something.
You have to pay us from now on.
Pay you?
The kids are in control
of the game?
Why are you talking like that?
As soon as they get back,
they'll bust your asses.
Just cough it up.
Go home!
- What are you doing?
- What s going on?
It's decided then.
Decided?
You brought a gun into my home!
A gun in front of my kids?
You came in here with a gun!
Open the gate.
Let them out.
- What do you want?
- Give him 20 euros worth.
Let's go.
How long are you going to last
in this game?
You'll only last half an hour!
A half an hour is all you'll last!
You're still wet behind the ears!
You'll come to an ugly ending!
All of you!
What if your dad comes back?
It's early still.
Are you sure?
They close at 11:30 or midnight.
Okay.
What are you doing?
You're so hairy!
You're like a monkey.
I'll pluck them out.
I'll remove them.
Yeah.
Get off!
Are you serious?
What do you think?
- Does it hurt?
- No.
Not at all.
Jesus!
My God!
- You skinned me.
- Let me finish.
- What are you doing?
- Throw that away.
Let me finish.
We've only just started,
I can't leave it like that.
I'll do it myself,
get me a razor.
You skinned me. Look at this.
- Here, and some soap.
- Good.
Tomorrow's the concert.
- Tomorrow?
- Did you forget?
At Arzano junction.
I can't tomorrow.
- What do you mean, you can't?
- I can't tomorrow.
You bought me the tickets
and now you can't come?
Tony Colombo
plays thousands of concerts,
we'll go another time.
But I want to go with you tomorrow.
Take Teresa,
we'll go together next time.
Don't be upset.
We're here.
Give me the money.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Here.
- That s a lot of money.
- I've worn my fingers out.
Let's spend this on hookers.
I want to see you in good shape.
Hello, how you doin?
Your table.
- Call if you need anything.
- Bring some bottles.
Biscottino, come here.
See that table,
it's the Traiano gang's.
Really?
And that's the Ponticelli table.
- Scampia's here too.
- In the middle?
And Quartieri Spagnoli.
There they are, the scumbags!
Go on, Biscotto.
Take it easy, you retard.
Don't overdo it.
Pass me a glass.
Easy does it, wait.
These bottles are on me tonight.
Pour!
Screw those scumbags!
You re number one!
Let s toast!
To our health!
To us!
Let's show them.
Come here!
Come here, Nicola.
Hey!
Just look at those deadbeats!
Up yours!
Suck our dicks!
Drink, Nicola!
We're the best now!
A bunch of deadbeats!
Deadbeats!
The tossers are staring at us!
Dance!
We'll eat them for dinner!
Let them hear us!
We're number one!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Is anything wrong?
No, everything's fine.
You used to pay those other guys?
We're in charge now,
you don't have to pay any more.
Great! Can I tell the others?
Sure, tell them all!
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Thanks, can I get you anything?
- That's okay.
- I like this.
Put it down, if you want it,
you can buy it.
- Bye.
- Bye, take care.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Leave it, you don't have to
pay any more.
- Really?
- We're in charge now.
Understand?
You don't have to pay any more.
Mom!
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Good morning, Mrs Vittoria.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.
- Is everything okay?
- Fine, thanks.
Good morning.
You don't have to pay up anymore.
- Cool.
- Do you like it?
Thanks.
Sanità neighborhood.
Thanks.
Don't ride on the field!
Do you like the jerseys?
They're awesome.
Give me one, too.
I've assigned you number 10.
Okay?
Raffaele?
All done.
Come on, kids!
This jerk off is rooting for Juventus!
- What are you doing here?
- He wants to be with us.
Shut up,
go and play football.
- I want to stay here.
- Go and play.
Do what your brother says.
And score a goal.
Wow!
What's this?
It's a double bass spirits cabinet.
- Do you just have this color?
- We have it in ivory too.
I like this flowery wallpaper.
This is the other color.
I love this one.
- I want it.
- In our home?
Yeah, in our home.
And this wardrobe, too.
Will it fit?
Yeah, in the bedroom.
It's got a mirror.
With the TV in front.
And we've furnished the bedroom.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, don't worry.
It'll cost a fortune.
Don't you worry, I'll see to it.
Look at this mirror.
It's got a nice light.
It'll look nice all down the hall.
It's nice.
Total comes to 12,000 euros.
You'll need to leave
a 30 percent deposit.
That's 3,600 euros.
I'll get it.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
We bought some new furniture.
- Lift it!
- Can you manage?
What are you doing?
Watch out.
Let's not break it!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, don Vittorio.
- Good morning.
Easy does it.
I got you a present.
What is it?
- The bomb.
- Go on, launch the bomb!
There it goes!
You do it now.
Bastards.
Another bomb, well done.
More bombs.
- The shit!
- You killed him!
The shit! Go, go!
Where are you?
I've used up my ammunition.
- Do you need bullets?
- Yes.
Let's go and get some.
Now your time under house
arrest won't seem so bad.
It'll fly by.
You're still up?
I'm waiting for you.
The new furniture arrived.
You see?
It looks different already.
- What happened here?
- Quiet, you'll wake Cristian.
- What did you do?
- Quiet!
I thought since you always
get up late,
you won't be disturbed in here.
I put your clothes in here.
Your jackets up here.
And your summer stuff down here.
- But why?
- Don't you worry.
I bought the bed
and the wardrobe for you!
I'll be fine in there. Quiet.
- Good night.
- Love you.
Good night.
- Where is it?
- What?
- Did you eat the jam tarts?
- No!
Are you telling lies, too?
Who ate them then, Mom?
What's all this ruckus?
- He says I ate the jam tarts.
- Are you arguing over snacks?
I bought some more.
He does it to piss me off.
What's so funny?
Don't ever do that again.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Like my new scooter?
- Awesome!
- It flies!
- I'm scared!
He's scared!
- Drop me off here, hun.
- Here?
Dad's pissed at me.
Bye, guys.
Let s go and help.
I'll sort you out later.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Do you need a hand?
- No, thanks.
- I'll give you a hand.
- No, that's okay!
Go away!
I said it's not necessary.
- You don't need my help?
- No. Thanks anyway.
Where are you going?
- I came for my girlfriend.
- Get back to Sanità!
- Watch what you say.
- You watch it!
I'll smash your face in.
This is your last warning, okay?
Be good.
Have you got that?
Do you?
This is our turf,
don't come around here again.
Let them through.
Stop looking.
Stop looking, go away.
Get out of here.
You too.
Hands off.
You assholes.
Who the fuck are these morons?
A gang from Quartieri Spagnoli.
They broke the code
and pulled a gun
in front of his kid brother.
Turn that thing off!
- We're listening.
- We've paused it.
Let's go shoot up their 'hood.
- We'll take over their turf.
- Right.
- Let's get the guns.
- Wait!
- Letizia lives there.
- That's your problem.
What do you mean?
Can't we figure this out?
Figure what out?
It can't be solved any other way.
Or they'll think we shit our pants.
I can't set foot in
your neighborhood any more.
What do we do now?
Come and live with me.
We'll get a place in Sanità.
Just leave home?
That's the situation.
Will you tell my dad?
Okay, I'll tell him.
I'll go to the restaurant
and tell him.
He'll say no anyway.
He'll say no?
Then leave home anyway.
Don't listen to him.
You do realize
what you're asking me to do?
If that's the case,
let's forget it.
There's no point.
That's okay with you?
It's okay with me.
Nico!
You came then.
I'm glad to see you.
I'll cheer you up.
Look who's here!
Hey!
Nicola is here.
Snort a line.
Hi!
Biscottino,
I've got you a fabulous present.
Hi, babe.
Do you like me?
His beard will be showing soon.
What do you mean?
Look here.
Come with me.
I've got to go home, it's late.
- You can go later.
- My wife will shoot me.
Look who I brought.
How's it going, everybody?
A nice serenade for you.
Give us a nice serenade.
Sit here.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What's up,
didn't you sleep at all?
No, I slept well.
It's just that I thought
I could trust you.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Last time you told me
I wouldn't have to pay any more.
- That's right.
- It's not right.
We're all paying up.
Nothing's changed.
Who collects the money?
The blond boy, Limone.
The Strianos' boy.
He comes here and collects the money
just like before.
Is that true?
Of course, I wouldn't joke
about these things.
We'll make them bow their heads.
- Give me that.
- Hey!
- This is mine.
- I saw it first.
Let go, I like it.
- Don't be a jerk off!
- I like it!
He saw it first.
It's mine now.
- Here.
- Give it here!
You're pissing me off!
What the fuck are you doing?
Do you know what your brother's up to?
- Do you know?
- No.
Extorting money from the shops!
Fuck the shops!
You'll make us look bad.
- Calm down!
- I won't calm down.
I lost my girl because of all this.
- Who, her?
- Yeah.
I don't want to argue.
Neither do I.
Kick your brother out.
Now.
You can't ask me to do that.
I can't?
Get out.
What do we do now?
The gang we kicked out
might come back again.
We've got the Quartieri gang
and the Strianos against us.
What do we do?
Hey, buddy!
Come here.
- What's up?
- Who's this?
- Have you got a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.
You smoke weed,
but you have no cigarettes?
No.
- Ask your friends for one.
- I said, I don't have any.
- What do you want?
- I only asked for a cigarette.
He doesn't have any.
Go away!
Is this your dad?
You fucking idiot!
Sorry.
Let's get out of here.
- Go!
- Hop on!
Look, we're in the newspapers.
"Shots fired outside the disco.
Man killed."
What's that?
He was right to shoot.
Don't be stupid!
Get rid of this gun.
What's going on?
Go home, everybody.
Bye.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Later.
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
Let's get some sleep.
Come outside.
No. No!
Stop it!
- You lose.
- No.
- Give me a kiss.
- No!
Get off me!
You can't get away from me!
This is where we'll go.
This is what life's about.
Where is it?
Puglia, Gallipoli.
When are we going?
- Now.
- Now?
- I want to leave straight away.
- But I've got no clothes.
We'll buy everything there...
clothes, swimsuits, sunglasses.
How long will it take?
Five to six hours, by taxi.
- Taxi?
- Yeah.
We'll call one in ten minutes.
How long will we stay?
As long as you want.
A week, two, a month.
All summer maybe.
It's all crowded with people.
Is that so?
Do you want to go
for the podium dancers?
There are health-crazy guys, too.
- It's gorgeous.
- Fantastic.
We'll call a taxi after dinner,
10 minutes and we're off.
It'll take us five to six hours, though.
What's up?
Let's go.
Let s go.
Come on!
Help!
Thanks.
Good night.
It's Dad.
What's this?
Nothing serious.
- We'll leave tomorrow then?
- Yes.
We'll go to Puglia.
We'll buy clothes and swimsuits
and go to the beach.
We'll go dancing
in the evening, okay?
Take this stuff off here.
Come here.
Give me a hand.
Look at this.
It's huge!
It's huge!
Oh my God!
Look at this.
Oh my God.
Take a look.
Is it Christmas?
Ho-Ho-Ho!
Awesome!
- Let's shoot the machine-gun.
- Put it back, we don't know how.
It's loaded.
The bullets.
Where will we fire it?
The Quartieri Spagnoli turf.
See this place?
They pointed a gun
at me and my brother here.
- Come on, get it out!
- Go on!
Go on!
- Come on, shoot!
- Aim it good!
Let me shoot it, too.
You try.
Let's get out of here!
- I've been hit!
- What do you mean, hit?
I've been hit.
Hello?
What's happened?
It's serious?
Tell me!
What's up?
You stay here.
