THE WELL-DIGGER'S DAUGHTER
You want to cross?
Cross the stream?
Why, is it yours?
It crosses my father's fields.
No one owns water.
I do when it's on my land.
The land isn't yours
whatever you paid for it.
Why not?
- You don't work it.
Don't tug, the knot's too tight.
I have my father's lunch.
I need to cross.
Pick up your basket.
Thank you.
Patricia!
- Felipe!
Careful, the mines are about to go off.
Come up here.
Everything fine, Patricia?
That one was good. She did a grand job.
That one's a dud.
A beauty! A real beauty!
Six full barrows, that one! That's it.
The third mine?
It conked out.
The third one conked out. It's my fault.
I bored the rock.
I thought there was more rock behind it
but it was soft underneath.
So the mine conked out.
A tablecloth?
A place for me?
- Yes, it's a special day.
You're 18 today?
Yes, with a surprise for Father.
Polenta! Sweet Mary!
Climbing up out of the well
will be tough later.
With a winch, you can bring up the dead.
Stew!
Is it really your birthday today?
Yes, Father, April 21.
I always forget things like that.
Eating with us?
Too busy.
You give gifts on your birthday?
Without the gift of life from Father,
it wouldn't be my birthday.
I should have brought a bottle.
I don't like fancy wine.
This stuff is good. It's the best.
How's the well going?
- Slowly.
Will it give a lot?
There's a spring.
Two more metres and we'll have wet feet.
You're leaving?
My sisters have to be at school by 1:30.
Goodbye, Patricia.
Thank you and happy birthday.
Thank you.
See you later, pet.
Put your hat on!
She's as kind as she's pretty.
You can say that again, Felipe.
And everyone forgot her birthday?
I didn't know the date but you did.
Of course I didn't forget.
But a surprise needs preparation.
You were being smart...
Of course I was being smart, you fool.
You have gift for her?
- A nice one!
I gave her sister Amanda 40 francs
to buy here a hat at Paris Hats.
We'll surprise her at dinner.
That's why I put on the act.
A hat is a nice gift for a girl.
See you later!
When she was born, the women
called me in to see the baby,
red as a lobster. I was happy.
Then I saw he didn't have a willy
and I wasn't so happy.
Why? A girl is nice too.
True, but until she marries,
you don't know her name.
Then my wife gave me
another daughter, then another.
One day, she said,
"A lady from Paris came down here to rest
and wants to take
Patricia back with her."
A lady without children but with money.
I thought: "With all these girls
I won't notice if one's missing."
And I thought: "The girl's lucky.
She'll be warm and well fed."
She was six when she went away.
My wife gave me more daughters,
then the Good Lord took her.
And I ended up, poor wretch than I am,
with five daughters and the oldest,
Amanda, only 14.
You poor fellow! What a calamity!
Eat up.
One day, the lady from Paris died too
and Patricia came home.
She was 15. I didn't recognize her
and didn't understand when she spoke.
Then she gave me a kiss,
washed the whole brood
and replaced her mother.
Everyone has a kind word for her.
She isn't a daughter,
she's a treasure from the Good Lord.
I love her now as much as I'd love a son.
That sounds silly but it's true.
As much as a son.
You'll miss her when she marries.
It has to happen, but I'd rather
not think about that!
Or maybe she could marry a man
in our line of work
who lives nearby.
That way, you won't lose her.
A young lady needs my help again.
There used to be a footbridge...
It's further upstream.
Thank you.
No need to go so far. I'm here.
Do you do this all day?
- I'd be happy to.
Now I've got you...
Tell me your name.
- Why?
Why not? Are you from Salon?
Yes.
Keep walking. Hurry!
I'm in no rush.
Please! Someone might see us.
No one's here.
Where's that Paris accent from?
My convent school in Paris.
Odd shoes for a convent girl.
If I were rich, I'd have nicer ones.
Take me across now.
- Who are you?
I'm not telling you!
I'll hold onto you then.
I'll pull your hair!
Go ahead, it's strong.
Move.
You're a tough one!
If I hurt you, too bad for you!
Who are you?
A girl. The well-digger's daughter.
He's the only one in the world?
No, but definitely the bravest.
You're very beautiful.
You talk such nonsense...
Are you from Salon?
- I was born there.
Then I studied in Lyon and Paris.
What's your name?
- Jacques Mazel.
The general store's son?
- Exactly.
Is this yours?
Yes, it's mine.
Are you going back to Salon?
What is it to you?
I could take you back.
Ever been on a motorbike?
No.
- You should try it.
You'll have to leave me
at the Lancon road.
No one lives there.
- I'll walk the rest of the way.
You won't go too fast?
No, I'll make the pleasure linger.
Climb on.
Hold onto my waist. Don't be afraid.
If you hold on too tight,
I'll pull your hair.
I won't be afraid if you go fast.
Were you scared?
- A little but it was fun.
Thank you.
Will you come to the cinema?
No.
Pretty blunt...
Goodbye then.
Goodbye.
Waiting for something?
For you to go.
Mr. Mazel!
- What?
Your lady's having a fit.
Big surprise. She saw the paper?
A customer showed her.
Wonderful. Is she crying or wailing?
The tears are leaping from her eyes!
The wailing's over. I'll go up.
Put that at the back.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Did you know?
I don't know what you mean.
What's the matter?
Tomorrow, in Salon.
The air show..
Jacques told us.
He lied to us.
He thought he wasn't taking part.
- Liar!
He's your son all right.
I hope you're sure of that.
What has he done?
Look at the paper.
You've already seen it
but you're pretending otherwise,
you hypocrite!
I was going to tell you later.
I'm hungry, mother.
I've been thinking about what you said.
So have I.
She'll marry one day.
- That's nature's way.
When you said: "Someone in our trade
who lives nearby,"
you probably meant someone like you?
Yes, I meant someone like me.
I wouldn't be against a man like you...
If my daughter was like other girls.
The thing is, she's not like us.
You understand?
I understand.
She speaks French with posh
accent like a minister.
She eats with a fork...
I could do that too.
I know, you are modern.
She's always making
dresses, doing her hair...
She's a princess, see.
- Yes, a princess.
Can you see yourself wed to a princess?
Not really... But I want to be.
If I don't give her to you
I might lose her completely.
A prince might pass by one day
and carry her off to America or Tuscany...
Princes are rare now.
But doctors, dentists and tax
inspectors are as bad.
True. But if she married me,
you'd have nothing to worry about.
It's fine talking of marriage
but you'll need money put by.
I have money put by
and an inheritance too.
An inheritance? A big one?
18000 francs. And 13000 put by.
31000 then?
- No, 30000. I bought a car.
You have a care?
- You bet.
Not a race care but it works.
And I own my house.
And it's near yours.
I see you as a friend, Felipe.
But she has to like the idea.
You're right. Could you ask her?
20 pounds of explosive in your pack
and you're afraid of my daughter?
I'll try.
I can take her to the air show
tomorrow in my car.
That'd be nice. She'll have her hat,
you your car.
Buy her beer or lemonade and talk to her.
I did that with her mother.
Was she as beautiful?
- Much more beautiful!
The girl's pretty but her mother...
What a woman!
She had a...
She was...
Good evening.
- Good evening, girls.
Good evenings, Felipe!
- Good evening, Felipe.
Good evening, Felipe.
He has a surprise for you
for your birthday.
Tell her.
Go on, you great lummox!
Is it bad?
Not at all. He has a car.
You have a car?
Yes. And I have tickets
for the air show.
When?
- Tomorrow.
So I thought,
with your father's permission,
and if you want to,
we could go there in my car.
That's kind of you but I can't tomorrow.
Why not?
I have to do the laundry.
I knew there'd be something.
It has to be tomorrow?
I'm behind. And my dress isn't ready.
My dress is ready.
I'd love to see the airmen.
Shut up, you!
Get in a car, I'll break your arm!
Rubbish...
I'll show you.
So the answer's no?
- I'd like to go but I can't.
Some other time then.
Too bad. Eat.
Staying for dinner?
- My sister's expecting me.
It's Patricia's birthday!
If she asked me to, I'd be happy to stay.
Only she's not asking.
Of course I am.
Leonore, set an extra place.
I didn't want to impose,
but if I'm invited, I'm glad to accept.
And your sister, Felipe?
She's at our uncle's.
I just lied to be polite.
You're tactful, Felipe.
That was very tactful of you.
Leonore... - Yes.
- Come and put Roberte to bed.
Amanda... Put the hat on the table.
What's that?
What is it? Did you bring it?
No, it wasn't me.
Do you know, Amanda?
- No, father. I have no idea.
No, we don't know.
Thank you, Father.
I did nothing but a kiss is nice.
And it's a pretty hat.
You chose it?
Yes. Do you like it?
Yes, I like it.
So put it on and see how it looks.
Not now, Father.
I need to do my hair, dress up...
I'll wear it to mass.
All right.
You could have worn it to the air show.
I could have but I can't.
The tickets cost 25 francs.
Maybe they're fake.
No, not at all.
My friend Imbert gave them to me.
He's in the air force.
He's the mechanic for Jacques Mazel,
the store owner's son.
The son's in the air force?
He's a pilot. An officer.
He's flying tomorrow.
And you know him?
He went to school with my sister.
He's a gentlemen now,
but still a kind fellow.
If he sees me, he'll say hello.
So you see, Patricia,
I'd be honoured
to be with a girl like you.
In that hat!
- You said it.
And the dress and the car!
The car won't impress him much.
But you will!
Can't Amanda do the laundry?
Do you mind doing it all?
Me? I'd be glad to.
All right, I'll go.
Thank you, Felipe.
No, I should thank you.
I won't dress like this.
I won't say I'll do you proud.
No one will see me in your light.
But I'll be clean and decent. A gentleman.
Let's eat, gang!
I knew she'd go. The hat made
her change her mind.
You don't do the laundry
in a hat like that.
Listen, it's Mother's song.
The one that made her cry?
Yes.
You know, I'm not jealous.
I know you won't want Felipe.
So, once you turn him down,
when he's tired of chasing you,
maybe he'll think of me.
But don't turn him down right away.
Why not?
He might marry someone else.
Give me time.
I dreamt of a flower that would never die.
I dreamt of a love
that would last forever.
Let's wait at the refreshment stand.
Jacques!
Felipe!
Why are you here?
To admire you, old chap.
Acrobatics impress people
but they're not hard.
Maybe, but down my well
I'm long way from the sky.
When I see you up there...
I'd like to introduce you to someone,
my boss's daughter.
Is she pretty?
- Terrific. Look.
So introduce me.
Jacques...
Patricia, my boss's daughter.
Planes interest you?
It's my first time but I was scared.
That's kind, for the pilots.
She does so much for her family!
She takes her father his lunch?
Who told you that?
You said he digs wells.
What can she do to help him?
Take him his lunch.
Exactly!
See the power of reasoning?
It's as if he'd seen it.
We're like that on the force.
Know who else flies?
Remy.
Remy the Klutz?
- In person.
Say hello. I'll wait with the young lady.
I won't be long.
Is he your fiancé?
No. I don't want him.
Only natural. You're not made for that
world or even that hat.
Before it was my shoes.
Now it's my hat you don't like?
Only because it hides your hair from me.
I'd like it otherwise.
It's from Paris hats.
- I can tell.
Will you be with Felipe all day?
Until seven, then I have to go home.
Why not visit your aunt?
What aunt?
Your aunt in Salon.
I don't have one here.
My only aunt lives in Fuveau.
Pity. You could tell Felipe
you were going to see her and meet me.
What nonsense...
If I tell Felipe I'm going to see my aunt,
he'll tell my father.
Your father and aunt have fallen out
over an inheritance.
Warn him.
Not a word of all that is true.
So it'll wash.
Meet me at Lancret at 5.
I wish I could,
but I mustn't.
Inheritances always cause trouble
in a family.
I'm not surprised your father
and aunt have fallen out.
Should I go and see her?
Your mother's sister? You have to.
I'd rather you stayed.
I even intended to...
Shall I go?
You could have gone
and come back by now.
Put your hat on.
You look after it.
Yes, it's best to look humble
with relatives.
Fear not, I'll hold it.
Thank you. See you later.
Waiter!
I need courage.
For a fight?
No, but 45 minutes from now,
I'll need some courage.
A lot or a little?
- A lot.
A huge amount. To propose to a girl.
Are we going to eat all these cakes?
Why not?
Where are we going?
- My place.
What will your parents say?
- Not a thing.
They're not there?
- No, they aren't.
What if they come back?
They won't come back.
I'm taking you to my workroom.
I go there to get some peace.
It's full of papers and books. Come on.
But you told me...
You saw Lancret was full.
Waiter!
Sit down. I'll get us a drink.
I think I must be mad.
You are. Mad to worry.
This is perfectly natural.
Where's the harm in having a drink?
I'm not going to stay.
Sit down.
Leave me alone! Aren't you ashamed?
Yes, I am.
If you try that again...
I won't.
I was a brute. Forgive me.
You're so beautiful.
Usually, a girl of 18...
I told you.
I didn't believe you.
But I should have.
And I should never have come here.
Patricia!
Let's not part like this.
Was it true what you said earlier,
that you're mad about me
and will love me forever?
I overdid it a bit.
Real love doesn't happen that fast.
Have you ever known real love?
No. Quite frankly no.
So why do you talk about it?
That's how I imagine it.
Maybe I'll find it one day.
Don't judge me on a moment of madness.
Excuse me, Mr Mazel.
Listen...
We've done no wrong
but I did kiss you.
So you must call me Jacques.
Forgive me, Jacques.
I know you're a decent young man at heart
and many girls wouldn't be this silly,
because you're handsome.
But I just can't.
I can't.
Forgive me.
Felipe?
Patricia! Forgive me!
You've been drinking?
Yes, and now I'm drunk.
Is your ant well?
Very well. Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.
Don't go with him. He'll kill you!
Me? Kill her?
Was your aunt pleased?
Felipe, it's seven o'clock.
Can you take me home?
The car won't obey me. I won't risk it.
Why not take the bus?
- It's left!
And my father?
- Yes, her father...
Jacques!
Jacques!
Jacques!
Felipe, what's wrong?
My saviour. Can you take her home?
But, Felipe...
Go with him.
If I have no choice...
It's because my father.
- If she isn't back by 8, he'll fall ill!
He'll ask where I am!
What'll you say?
Your car broke down and you
entrusted her to me.
You asked me to stop.
I know.
Your scarf flew off.
I know.
But there's something
you don't know.
The wind didn't undo my scarf. I did.
With the bike going so fast,
I clung to you
and the scent of the wind
made my head spin.
I was scared of falling.
A declaration of love?
Or of weakness.
I had never been so close
to a boy before but now...
Now what?
Don't exaggerate. All young men
and women go through this.
I can't kiss my father
and sisters anymore.
A little girl's notions.
If every girl reacted that way,
families wouldn't kiss much.
If one of us has acted badly, I have.
You've given me proof of your love.
But it proves I don't deserve to be loved.
Take me home quickly now
and forget all about it.
You don't want to see me anymore?
Why bother? You're rich
and I'm well-digger's daughter.
Can I see you somewhere tomorrow?
Saint Julien's chapel.
There's a cypress next to it.
Tomorrow near the cypress at 11.
If you want, but what use will it be?
You really don't want to see me again?
I do.
I don't know. I'm not myself anymore.
I'm someone else!
And I love you.
I love you.
That's a bit rich! Africa?
Why Africa?
- For trials.
What trials?
- I can't tell you.
Dangerous ones?
Not really.
- For long?
Two or three months.
Why right away? Is it that urgent?
The orders came last week.
Charbonnier broke his leg today
and Mazel was picked to replace him.
Listen...
I have a problem.
Have you been playing poker?
- No.
I've met a girl. Patricia.
A well-digger's daughter.
So what?
We have a rendezvous.
- Not anymore. - I know.
But she'll be there.
I'd like you to go along
and tell her I got urgent orders
to leave tonight.
She mustn't think
I knew I was leaving.
Here's a letter for her.
Will you go?
- Yes, I'll go.
You promise?
I promise.
Given the situation,
the government will supplement
the measures taken
by calling up additional reservists.
All men whose mobilization papers
have the figures 6 and 7
in the upper left-hand corner
must join their depots post haste.
Long live Republic! Long live France!
My son's on the front already.
Are those paid for?
Yes, they're paid for.
There's no receipt...
And with all this emotion...
Emotion doesn't make people thieves.
Come on, Felipe.
They're good tools
but I won't use them much.
From what they said on the radio,
I have to leave right away.
Go and have a drink. I forgot something.
Come on, Amanda.
What did you forget?
- You'll see.
Maybe he's buying cigarettes.
Maybe. I know he's fond of me.
He wanted to give me time to talk.
Sit down.
Listen, Felipe...
No, don't interrupt
or I won't be able to say this.
Here goes.
I've known you for three years now.
I've noticed that when
I see you I'm happy
and when I don't, I'm not happy.
When you're around,
I don't notice other girls.
When I'm digging down a well,
I see your pretty face
and you smile at my work.
And now I've been called up...
Are you starting to understand?
I understood long ago. I know
you'd make a good husband.
But I can't say yes.
Does that mean no?
I'm very fond of you, Felipe.
But you don't love me.
In every couple one is more
in love than the other.
Shall we try?
I can't, Felipe.
I just can't. I'll be having a child soon.
Oh, Lordy...
That's quite a blow.
Worse than the war for me.
And for me?
Yes, of course, for you too...
But who's the father?
A very rich gentlemen.
What does he say?
He doesn't know.
You should tell him.
He's already gone to war.
Who knows if he'll come back?
Even if he does, I won't see him again.
He doesn't love me and I'm poor.
I'll never ask anything of him.
But your father...
Does he know you're in trouble?
No, he doesn't know yet.
Marry me and we'll say it was me.
I can tell him right away.
Too bad if he hits me!
Thank you, Felipe,
but I'll tell him myself.
You still have hope for the other fellow?
No hope at all.
Do you love him? Truly love him?
If it's the same for women as for men,
you'll never get over it.
I'll go to see your sister.
Thank you, Pascal.
He's going to leave now.
- It can't be helped.
Maybe they'll kill him.
- Why?
Because he's off to war.
No, Pascal. They don't kill everyone.
Not right away.
All I'm saying is
you're risking your life.
That proves how brave you are.
He is brave, isn't he?
There's room here!
Remember, you'll get leave too.
Too bad your father died last year.
If he'd waited, you'd have had more leave.
He would have like to wait.
You get leave to get married too.
Of he got married, he'd get leave.
What are you crying for?
You want a couple of slaps?
Farewell, Felipe!
Farewell, everyone!
Farewell!
- Farewell!
News of the war?
There's not much hope.
Did he ask you?
Yes, he asked me.
And what did you say?
I said no.
Maybe you were wrong to.
I couldn't say yes.
That's your business.
Just don't expect a prince to turn up.
I have to tell you something serious.
About Felipe?
About me. - You're scaring me.
- I have to tell you.
If you're in love with another boy,
don't tell me.
I don't know how to listen
to girl's stories.
You're my father. I have to talk you.
Yes... but can't this other boy
come to see me?
Is he away at the war too?
Yes, he's gone away. But even he wasn't
he wouldn't come.
Why not?
I'm not a woman for him.
- What's that supposed to mean?
He wouldn't want me.
- So who is it? Just out of curiosity.
What boy wouldn't want you?
The King of England?
He may as well be.
If he doesn't want to propose, fine.
It's not worth talking about.
I have to tell you about him
and who he is...
the boy I loved.
Loved? You've known him a while?
No, I've seen him twice.
Just twice and you love him?
I looked at your mother 5 years
before knowing I loved her.
Things happen faster these days.
Who is he?
Jacques Mazel, the store owner's son.
Did he promise you anything?
No, father, no promises.
But I gave him everything.
You've sinned?
And I thought you were an angel.
Angels don't live on earth.
I'm like any other girl.
May I come closer?
You're my daughter.
I'll share your misfortune.
Come here. You're trembling all over.
You don't know the worst part yet.
There's something else.
Something everyone will see.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
If your mother were alive,
this wouldn't have happened.
Are we eating or not?
Lord knows what it would take
to ruin your appetite.
If I could stop the war
by going on hunger strike,
I wouldn't hesitate a second.
But since I love my son
as much as you do,
I'll eat as usual to keep his
father alive for him.
Sir... Pascal the well-digger
wishes to speak to you both.
What about? - It's serious.
He's with all his daughters.
He must be mad!
He seems calm and polite.
He's probably seeking charity.
- Not charity, madam!
I've never asked for charity
and I'm not going to start now.
Calm down, Amoretti.
I know you're a good worker.
Thank you, Mr. Mazel.
Why have you brought these
pretty girls to see me?
To show you how pretty they are.
This is the youngest. She's four.
Look at these calves:
as firm as a corn-fed chicken.
And no one can match her in intelligence.
Roberte, say hello to Mr Mazel.
Hello, Mr Mazel.
Blow a kiss to his lady.
She's well-trained.
She has a good memory.
Look at the others.
Look at Isabelle's cheeks!
The picture of health.
Our blood is good.
These are my daughters.
So why are you here?
I'll send them out first.
Amanda, take them out and stay with them.
Why are you here giving orders?
The only orders I give are to my
daughters and my pickaxe.
Come here, Patricia.
I'm beginning to suspect
some form of blackmail.
Marie, don't jump to conclusions.
Pascal is an honest man.
Thank you, Mr. Mazel.
This girl is far too pretty
with eyes a little too lowered.
If she's keeping them lowered,
maybe she has a reason.
And what does "too pretty" mean?
A girl can never be too pretty.
She's 18 years and 4 months old.
The best age for girls.
I know what surprises you.
She's not like a well-digger's daughter.
But I don't see that as a crime.
At home, we often say:
"Patricia is a princess."
Congratulations on being
the father of a princess.
What else?
I have a daughter who's a princess.
And you, you have a son.
And, from what I'm told, he's a prince.
Is he at the front?
- None of your business.
What he does is none of my business
but what he did to my daughter is.
So that's it!
Listen here, if I had to receive every girl
who's sweet on my son, we'd need to move house.
So let's drop it.
Pascal, this conversation is absurd.
Keep an eye on your daughters
or the boys will whisper
sweet nothings to them.
Father, let's leave.
Wait, they don't understand.
Mr Mazel, sweet nothings
are fine in the springtime
but then summer comes along,
and then autumn,
and fruit grows beneath the leaves.
Catch my drift?
- Blackmail!
Andre, show them out immediately
or I'll call the gendarmes!
The gendarmes?
Your son gets my girl with child
and you'd call the gendarmes?
What do you expect them to do?
Make her give birth here?
Boys with looks and money
should stay away from poor girls.
My son's not paying for others!
No, no, no and no!
Women talk a lot, then think afterwards.
What do you say, as a man?
I say you know pickaxes
better than girls.
As for girls, Pascal,
men and fathers never understand them.
But since you're a decent fellow,
I'll write to my son...
Don't pester Jacques with this.
He has better to do.
He doesn't have time to fret over
a well-digger's queasy daughter.
If my son held you in his arms,
he did you a great honour.
Well, we'll be content with that.
Are we leaving?
Yes, we're leaving.
But first of all, Mr Mazel,
let me explain something.
Your good lady seems to think
I came here to steal from you.
She's very much mistaken.
I came here to tell you
what was going on.
In my daughter's misfortune,
I've found a child.
For me, that's like finding a wallet.
An honest man asks himself:
"Whose wallet is this?"
So I asked my daughter:
"Whose child is it?"
And she tells me:
"Jacques Mazel's."
So I thought:
"His father has to know."
And I was hoping you'd say:
"In that case,
"my son will request leave
to come and get married."
Personally, I wouldn't have
refused him Patricia's hand.
And then one day, the child would be born
and we'd light fireworks to celebrate.
That's what I thought.
I was stupid. I didn't know you.
I see now that it's wise to be wary of
people who sell tools
but who never use them.
You reject the girl and the child.
You're wrong to.
I don't know whose child this is now.
It won't have a name.
My daughter is a lost girl now.
And she's even lost for me.
Come on, Patricia.
You'll tell this story to everyone!
No. This isn't something you talk about.
I won't talk about it.
But don't say anything either.
It's a sad matter for us
but a very nasty one for you.
Enjoy your lunch.
Amanda...
Go on ahead with the girls.
Come here.
This is where I lose you.
I knew it, Father.
The bus comes by at two.
Take it.
Go to my sister Nathalie's
and tell her everything.
She'll understand
because she did silly things too.
She'll take care of you.
As for me...
It's not that I don't love you...
I love you too much
to be able to show you.
The thing is, they didn't want you.
I did what I could, openly. But you saw:
they don't want you.
So you have to go away.
For the girls' sake.
They'll shortly start
asking you questions.
The neighbours too.
You have to start a new life elsewhere.
Here you'd be a lost girl.
My life is lost wherever I go.
Here more than anywhere.
You have to leave, the sooner the better.
I thought about it all night
and I'm ready.
I'll send your things in a box with the bus.
I wish someone would put me in a box
and take me to the cemetery.
That wouldn't chance anything.
The girls are watching.
so I'll give you a kiss.
Come here.
For the girls' sake.
Farewell.
Farewell, Father.
Come on then.
Felipe! Did you sleep well on the train?
Yes, a soldier can sleep anywhere.
How long have you got?
- Thirty days leave. A month.
To convalesce.
You were wounded?
- A machine gun set my helmet ringing.
I took two prisoners.
You are a hero, Felipe.
Not really. I was just lucky.
What's new here?
I don't know.
Our aunt wrote.
Father burned the letter.
Without reading it?
- Yes.
We can take my car to go
and see your sister.
But Father...
- We'll just go for a drive.
You'll take me there?
- Of course I will.
Would you like me to come?
- Yes.
I'd rather not to go along
to see your sister.
Has Mr Mazel written to his son
to tell him?
I don't know.
It makes no difference anyway.
They say he's dead in the war.
Jacques? Dead?
If he was dead,
you'd have been informed.
They informed me his plane went down
behind German lines. In flames.
The body hasn't been found?
In flames.
I'm trying to find out more but hope is
fading by the day, little by little.
I'm convinced of it, Felipe.
He won't come back.
Boss, how much is the clock
with the sailor?
275 francs.
-Will 250 do?
No. 275, that's as low as I'll go.
- All right.
275.
Did you hear what I just said?
I didn't.
I talk, I just talk...
I look like I'm talking.
Life seems to go on.
Deep down, it isn't me talking.
I'm like a sort of gramophone
talking alone.
Pascal!
Felipe!
Haven't you won that war yet?
I'm not mad enough yet
but I soon will be.
People say it hasn't started yet.
Some people know it has.
And started badly for them too.
I feel sorry for him.
I don't care if he's grieving or not.
Don't say that, Pascal. Maybe you don't
care but it concerns you.
His son...
He had a son?
You know he did, Pascal.
He's been missing three weeks.
His plane was shot down.
Does Patricia know?
Patricia? Who's that?
You knew a girl
called Patricia? I didn't.
Pascal, it's just you and me here.
Let yourself go for once.
You came on leave to pester me?
No, I'm speaking to you as a friend.
So don't say words I don't want to hear.
There's Amanda.
Look how pretty she's now.
A good wife for a working man!
Staying for lunch?
Do you mind?
- I'd be delighted.
I'll stay.
This afternoon, I'll take Amanda
for a drive in my car.
With your permission.
If you want to, go ahead.
But remember, Felipe...
Keep an eye on her.
If you see a young gentlemen with a fancy
motorbike who says:
"Felipe, I'll take the girl home."
tell him, "No."
A motorbike doesn't look like much,
but it can carry off a family's happiness.
Eat up.
It's not too hot?
Good, isn't it?
You didn't break down this time?
No. The car worked well.
Did you see Patricia?
Eat your soup up now.
Why doesn't Patricia come
and give me my soup?
Shut up and eat.
Did you two have fun?
- Yes.
He bought me nougat at the fair.
Was it busy there?
It was packed.
- Yes.
I asked the postman where Patricia is.
And the postman gave me a kiss.
Amanda, put her to bed.
Let's go.
The postman's nice.
His moustache prickles.
- Yes, he's nice.
Blow Daddy a kiss.
- No.
You won't blow me a kiss?
No. Not you. You're nasty.
Put her to bed.
You three go to bed too.
Good night.
So...
Where was the fair?
In Istres.
Was it a good one?
Yes. Well, like any fair.
And you were at the fair all afternoon?
All afternoon.
Apart from the time on the road.
Don't say you're lying!
I'll strangle you if you saw someone!
I'm not saying that.
I can see from your face you're lying!
I can't help it.
Amanda, come down here right now!
There are things you mustn't do.
If you have done something and haven't
told me, shame on you!
Come here, lost girl! You're as big a liar
as this fabricator!
Did you go to Fuveau?
It was my idea.
I wanted to know.
Know what?
How she was. And now I know.
She's well.
A little pale but she's well.
Too bad.
Too bad. She doesn't deserve it
but she's well.
Too bad.
- That's good.
The child has been born. We saw him.
It's a boy.
A boy?
- His name's Andre.
Why Andre?
Because that's the name of...
Well, it's a nice name.
Whose name is it?
It's Mr Mazel's name.
She forgot how that
money-grabber threw us out?
His name's Pascal too.
What?
She's dared to give that bastard
my Christian name?
The child is not a dog!
You talk back to me?
Are you proud of that hussy?
She's not proud, Pascal, believe me.
I love my sister.
Go to bed or I'll change
your face with a slap!
You know, Pascal...
- I know.
I have too many daughters.
If they side with her, I can hang red
light at my door.
Go to bed!
Giving that child two first names won't
give him a real name.
But he has a real name. A surname!
And what's his name?
His mother's name,
the same name as you.
His name's Andre Pascal Amoretti.
What are you saying, Felipe?
Have you gone mad?
His name's Amoretti?
Like me, like my father?
It's not my fault, it's the law.
Without a father,
he takes his mother's name.
A woman's name counts?
Of course. It's the law.
So he's taken everything,
my daughter and my name.
Who thought up a law like that?
How can I defend myself
against that fellow?
The lawmakers are stronger than us.
Anyhow, if you're not happy, there's a way
to change the boy's name.
How?
- He could take her husband's name.
How can she marry him if he's dead?
Yes, he's dead. But others aren't.
Me, say. If she married me, he wouldn't be
Amoretti, he'd be Rambert like me.
You'd agree to that?
- Yes.
So you'll take the lost girl
and the bastard too?
If she agrees, I'll take the whole lot.
Felipe, you don't have much honour.
No, you don't have much honour.
Maybe I don't have
honour, but I have love.
One can replace the other.
This shirt belongs to Bastien.
The tax inspector wears girl's blouses.
Let's go.
It's muggy today.
How is he?
He's sound asleep.
There you are!
Yes, here I am. Hello, sister.
Well?
- Well, here I am.
I need to talk to you
and to her there
pretending not to know me.
Father, I don't know what to say.
Your child has been born?
Yes, Father, he has.
It had to happen.
- Nathalie, you'd be wiser not to speak.
I won't shut up!
He was born in my bed
and I wash his clothes.
Shut it or I'll belt you
like one of your sheets!
The child is a boy and I'm told
his name is Amoretti.
Like me.
- Like me!
The name came from me first
because it's my name.
And our father? And our father's father?
He bears it as the first male after me.
A girl is Amanda, Noemie, or Isabelle.
A younger son is Pierre, Andre or Paul.
But the first son in Provence
has his family's name.
And this one here is called Amoretti.
Whether I like it or not
I'm responsible for him.
In what way?
In every way!
What shall I do?
I'll obey.
- Why are you here?
To tell you this is serious.
Yes, it's serious. We agree.
You've told us and now we know.
Now let us get back to our work.
Even more serious, the child
has to be fed and clothed.
Patricia, stay here.
I have something else to say.
About my son?
- Yes and no.
Felipe has had an idea.
If he weds you, the child
won't be bastard anymore.
He'll talk to you about it...
You have to refuse.
All right.
She can do better!
Airmen chase after us here.
She'll find someone to marry
a good catch.
The boy will have a pretty
name. A town name.
So that's it? That's what you are up to?
One crime wasn't enough and you're
planning to commit more!
You're going to pack your bags and
come home with me!
With my son?
If you want. I don't care.
She should leave him then.
He's the child of sin.
The shame of the family.
The second one after you.
Leave the two shames together.
I can raise him. What do you say?
She'll never agree to that.
Why not?
Aunt Nathalie will care of him.
Bringing the child to our home
would upset me.
I feel great rage towards him for
the suffering he's put me through.
But you'll languish without him.
You'll stop eating, get all skinny
then ask me to come and fetch him.
No, she won't!
What do you know? Have you had kids?
You'd have had 50 if you had!
And you, lying to me!
You act like you're not
dying to bring him!
What is this hypocrisy?
I don't like hypocrites!
You say what you think!
And if you don't say it, you do it!
Where are you going?
- To drown him!
Pascal! Wait!
You fool!
He was lying here in full sunlight.
Father, would you want us at home?
You, yes.
As for him, I don't know.
I don't know him yet.
I've been here an hour and no one
has lifted that cloth.
He is so tiny. He's not eating enough.
If his mother's milk isn't enough,
we can try chickpeas with an onion.
He has fingernails.
Never seen any before?
Yes, but I'd never looked this closely.
What are you staring at?
You've already fondled him
and let him tug your ears!
Pack her things, we're leaving!
And hurry it up, dammit!
Come on, open your eyes.
Amoretti, give us a smile.
Amoretti junior, come on,
show me your best smile.
It's for Amoretti senior.
Hello, young lady.
Hello, Mr Mazel.
Is your father around?
Yes, Mr Mazel. He's preparing his
cartridges over there.
My wife and I were taking a stroll
when I spotted the well gantry.
That reminded me my well needs cleaning.
Since your father doesn't
come to the store now...
Pascal!
Hello, Pascal.
- Hello.
About my well in the Castelas vines...
You know it?
Yes, I know it.
It needs cleaning out.
The water smells bad.
That'll be weeds and seeds rotting in it.
When could you come?
- After I finish here.
In another two weeks.
I'll wait two weeks then.
There's no hurry for the well.
I was worried you'd refuse.
I'm not rich enough to refuse work.
I have children to feed, Mr Mazel.
You're a lucky fellow, Pascal.
Very lucky.
You heard our tragic news?
Yes, I heard, but I thought
you still held out hope.
We had word officially yesterday morning.
It's over.
That's a terrible thing. Terrible.
God's ways are strange.
Anyhow your well...
It's 25 metres deep.
I know what needs doing. 
It'll cost you 300 francs or so.
That's agreed then, Pascal.
I hope you see at the store.
Maybe.
Goodbye, Mr Mazel.
Goodbye, madam.
Is that your child.
Yes, madam.
How old is he?
- Almost six months.
Can we see him?
Without waking him of course.
Just see him?
Of course, we're not ashamed of him.
Patricia, give me Amoretti.
What do you call him?
I call him by his name. Amoretti.
The old Latin tradition.
For my grandmother, I was always Mazel.
His name isn't Mazel, it's Amoretti.
And don't touch him.
He's a real boy you know,
with a mean streak.
Let's have a smile for the lady.
Let's have a smile for the lady.
He'll be tugging his aunt's hair in a few years.
He has five of them.
He's already quite a weight.
Here, hold him.
You shouldn't have.
I knew it make her sad.
It's not the unpleasant kind of sadness.
Let her weep.
Sit down, Marie.
Come on, let's talk.
Where do you want to go? If it's about
the baby, my daughter can hear.
According to you, this is our
poor dear boy's son.
According to me, he's my daughter's son.
But his father...
You know he was my son.
I know...
All I know is this is a fine child
but he's not the baby Jesus.
So he has a father. 
As to who that father is...
Who knows.
Patricia told you it was my son.
Do you believe Patricia
when she says something?
She's a girl. You never know with girls.
They're born liars. You taught me that.
I didn't know her then.
I've asked about her now. I know her.
Someone else rejected us. Your son.
I don't hold it against him.
But he could have come that day.
Jacques? What day?
He told me to meet him
at Saint Julien's chapel.
He never came.
He knew he wouldn't.
He left for Africa the next day.
He didn't know.
His captain came for him
at nine in the evening.
He left an hour later
to replace an injured colleague.
He didn't know?
I swear on his memory.
So he would have come?
Why didn't he send word to her?
He sent someone.
With a letter.
A letter for me?
How do you know that?
He asked me to go there for him.
I went. I saw you.
And I burned the letter.
You? You did such a thing?
So many girls wanted to take him from me!
He wrote to me...
Burning that letter was a dirty trick.
A really dirty trick.
You didn't let him know
about the baby?
No.
- That's another dirty trick.
A shopkeeper's dirty trick.
Be quiet, Father.
Don't you think
they're unhappy enough?
I think, I think...
I don't think anything.
I think this boy is called Amoretti
and he's my grandson!
Of course he is.
But what are we for him?
Passers-by.
- If you want.
But would it be a bad thing if we took
care of him a little?
Took care of him how?
We have money.
To much for the two of us.
We could buy him things.
Choose clothes, blankets and toys for him.
Take him to the doctor's.
To the doctor's? To kill him? No way!
If he were sick, fine. But if he were sick,
I'd take him without your help.
Amoretti will owe me everything.
He'll eat the bread I earn,
I'll give him his blanket,
earn his soup for him and when
he turns three, fear not,
I'll buy lamb cutlets for him too.
Your well, Mr Mazel, I said it was 25
metres deep. That's not true.
It's more than 30 metres.
Going down into it by rope
is tough enough for a young man.
I'm 56 but I'll go down there
to make money for the boy.
I asked for 300 franks,
but the job's worth 500.
But I won't owe you anything
because you have to owe me something
for treating me unjustly.
Pascal, you talk of justice but
you're unjust yourself.
If your son were alive,
you wouldn't be here.
Maybe, Pascal, maybe.
But can you be sure of that?
Can you swear on his crib
you're sure of that?
I won't swear anything.
Then don't get angry or use hurtful words.
These are hard and sad times for us all.
If you saw the state we're in,
you'd be a lot friendlier.
I have work to do, Mr. Mazel.
France loses the war,
Mr Mazel loses his son,
so I have to lose my grandson?
You're not going to lose him, Father.
Sure, sure...
In 10 days you have been
there five times.
They gave you
Stuff a poor man's child doesn't need!
And this carriage!
It's far too fancy.
It shows up my Sunday suit.
I thought we'd stay here today
and have fun with him.
Instead I have to put on my collar and tie
and take my family to the Mazels'.
Why did you promise? Why?
Mrs Mazel said she'd to tea for the girls
and give them toys.
I refused at first, but she insisted.
It's not easy saying no to her.
Not for me. I'll be able
to say no to her.
No, no and no!
I'll show you.
I know why they're
sucking up to us like this.
They have a plan?
You bet.
They're smart.
They know laws and solicitors.
If they manage to adopt him,
we'll count for nothing anymore.
It's not that simple.
It would require my consent.
Really?
If it requires your consent,
I have nothing to fear.
You're going alone?
- I said I'd be there at two.
All right. Go on.
But be careful.
If they try to get you to sign
any papers, be wary.
You have the courage
to look at those pictures?
I was just showing her.
- I can't look at them.
I just can't.
Hello, everyone! Hello to all!
Hello, Mr Mazel! How are you?
As well as can be expected, Felipe.
And yourself?
I couldn't be better.
Good for you.
I was walking along the street,
a little sadly,
when what do I see all of a sudden?
Your door standing open.
I told myself: "I'll go up and say hello.
"See how they are, have a chat..."
You may have reasons to be happy.
But we don't.
Who knows? Maybe you're not as unhappy
as you think you are.
Perhaps we won't see him again.
But no one's seen him dead.
Felipe, don't joke about such things.
I'm not joking, Mr Mazel.
Come on, I received official notice.
If I were you...
Until I was sure...
You're mad! Stop that!
No, madam, the thing is,
I just met some airmen.
They told me that Jacques
may well be alive.
Maybe he landed with his parachute.
It's not totally sure...
I wasn't going to tell you
in case it was too much.
But they think you'll be
getting a letter soon.
When? But when?
Or a telegram.
Or maybe he'll come to Salon any day now!
He's alive?
- Yes, he's alive!
His colonel sent me!
You're here and you're smiling.
Felipe told his story?
No, he couldn't.
But I guessed.
He told me something too.
Is it true?
How old is she?
He's almost six months.
You'd have proffered a girl?
I bring great news and learn great news.
Go up to see your parents.
I'll tell you later.
You were waiting for us?
Jacques is back.
- Jacques?
Which Jacques? The Mazel's Jacques?
He's with his parents.
You saw him?
- Yes, I saw him.
Is the baby up there?
You shouldn't have left him
with them all.
The boy just turned up like a ghost?
Felipe came to warn them.
He's here too?
- They're all embracing.
What a sight.
They can't stop crying for joy.
Mrs Mazel is like a fountain.
And the baby?
- They haven't thought about him yet.
Where's he off to?
- To get him.
What for?
My little baby...
Let's go.
- Why?
We're in the way here.
Let's leave them with their son.
You'll carry him?
- I can manage.
Let's not stay. It isn't polite.
If they want to see us,
they know where we live.
Let's go girls.
Can you see the car?
Felipe!
No!
- No, Felipe can't see it yet.
They said 11.
- Around 11.
It's five past. You're scared
they'll forget?
Don't worry, they'll come.
There's something here
more powerful than a magnet.
Shall I wear my hat?
Not in your home!
- But today's special.
Felipe says they're coming to propose.
You're mistaken.
With their son back,
they'll be as proud as before.
I doubt it. What do you think, Amanda?
I just want to cry.
When I ask a question, I always pick
the silliest one of you!
They're coming to propose.
Mr Mazel will wear white gloves.
Rich folks do.
At least they did in my day.
What if I held my hat?
What for? - To look natural,
like I'm going out.
They're here!
They're here!
- White gloves?
I don't know. I only saw a car.
Jacques is driving.
Jacques?
- Yes.
He seems to be in a hurry.
More than you are.
- Says who?
She always has something to say.
They're here. Act normal.
And don't say a word.
If you speak, I'll lose you in the woods
like Tom Thumb.
Tell them to come in.
Shut up!
Come in.
Hello, Pascal. Hello, girls.
Hello, Mr Mazel.
Hello, madam.
Hello, sir.
You didn't know our son?
No, madam. He's a fine looking boy.
Just as I imagined him. He's a prince.
There are no princes in our family.
Not as far as I know.
Pascal, I'm sure you can guess
why we're here.
I dare not guess Mr Mazel.
Should I send the girls out?
No, not this time, Pascal.
They can hear what I've come to say.
That's good, Mr Mazel.
Life's prettiest thing can be said
in front of little girls.
Pascal, God has returned our son.
I've had a long talk with Jacques
and I wish to say I deeply regret
the harm I've done you
without meaning to.
And I thank the Good Lord for giving
us a chance to erase our misdeeds.
I'm here to ask if you'll give my son
Jacques your daughter Patricia.
Since you started speaking,
sunlight has filled this house.
With a few honest words, you've made
the furniture gleam.
I agree, Mr Mazel.
You took your honour
but you're returning it today.
Thank you, Mr Mazel.
Now, we can walk through Salon laughing.
You're a good man, Pascal.
Maybe not that good,
but honest, Mrs Mazel.
When shall we have wedding?
- As soon as possible.
Let's go to the town hall
together tomorrow morning.
We'll ask for their papers...
Patricia's saying nothing.
She's too moved to speak.
That's true. I am very moved.
But I'd say something too.
I want to tell Mr and Mrs. Mazel
that we're honoured.
But Mr. Mazel spoke of erasing misdeed.
He said he regretted it.
Perhaps you're here with this proposal
out of a guilty conscience.
If that so, don't disturb
the mayor and the priest.
Jacques...
A marriage isn't a family
accepting a child.
It's a man who wants a woman.
You're here with your parents.
Out of love? Or remorse?
You're not saying anything?
May I? Let's get some air.
Where are they going?
They can't do worse than
what theyre already done.
Is it true?
- What?
Our wedding?
- It looks like it.
Are you pleased?
Of course not. But I don't
have much choice.
Don't touch me!
I don't need you or your store!
Silly... you believed me? I was joking.
You don't joke about that.
Because I love you.
I love you too. More than you think.
You never wrote to me.
I heard you were married.
She knew it wasn't true.
She wanted to protect me.
From me?
From the whole world.
She's my mother.
Felipe, you should take the girls away.
No we all agree, maybe we're
going to start fighting.
About what?
- Not in front in them.
The love-birds!
What's this about?
- You know.
The child.
Don't touch him.
Let him sleep.
Can't I look my grandson?
He may be your grandson.
But I'm his grandfather.
Before the wedding, we have to agree
and decide who this child belongs to.
What do you mean?
Is he mine or his?
He's ours.
Of course.
But where authority is concerned?
He has father and mother.
We're old enough to take care of him.
You can love him, care for him if need be
but this child isn't yours.
You're his.
You're right Jacques.
Love and serve, that's all the old can do
for the young.
He answered: he's smiling.
Yes, he's smiling.
Farewell, Amoretti.
Hello, little Mazel.
Whatever your name,
you're of my blood and you're smiling.
Am I disturbing you?
What do you want?
To ask Jacques something.
What?
- Your opinion.
Would you mind a brother-in-law
as dumb as me?
You want Amanda's hand?
You may have it.
- Thank you.
That's a good one.
What does it make me?
Pascal, you're my master.
I can't talk about your daughter now.
I'll ask you tomorrow,
in gloves of red clay, down the well.
