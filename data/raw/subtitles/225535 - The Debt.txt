Take the bags off.
Get two more divers.
Let them comb the river.
Those cut-off heads
must be somewhere.
- Don't stand there.
- And the plaster casts?
Take one of yourself.
It's snowing to boot.
- Been to the game?
- We f*** Lost.
Hurry up. We're freezing.
The way I feel - must be
Red fellas.
Good. Let them kill off
one another.
THREE MONTHS EARLIER
I told you.
It's to decorate the front.
And it will.
- With rounded boulders.
- It'll look super.
Pick up those that fit
and dump the rest.
And the money?
When I get the stones.
Hard to get along with you.
Unhappy, are you?
Hop on my back.
- You've flunked, right?
- I didn't even take it.
Why? Didn't we cram so hard?
Right. Cram we did.
- You've cut the birch?
- It was in the way.
Why wait? Let's load it.
Will we get a dog?
Should we get a dog?
We'll think about it.
Kids grow well with pets.
I've been to the doctor.
It's the seventh week.
So we crammed all right.
- What's this?
- See the page after the watches.
Martin, look.
- How much did he pay?
- I won't say.
Not a whole centerfold?
I need one more man
for an expedition.
I can't. Where to?
The Italians are here
in two weeks.
Everything's settled.
Something may always pop up.
Give me a week... five days.
- Okay.
- May I then?
Don't be a bore.
Jola!
It took me 45 min. To get
here. Where're the boys?
I must have...
...space, a garden, and some
room for the dog.
Chickens too? You had
a flat with a view.
What view?
- In one room with a kid?
- You blew it.
What kid?
- Did I say that?
- It wasn't me.
Did I say that, Babs?
Exactly.
You'll be big!
Adam likes them big,
remember?
When are we going
to have a baby, Steve?
In Italy, it's the rage.
And the sales in Austria -
exponential growth!
And you want
to mount those scooters here?
Market research - Okay.
Business plan...
Exemplary. Great!
But you don't qualify
for a credit yet.
You still need a solid
collateral.
And my apartment
and his plot?
Why, you said the contract
would suffice.
But you apply for
a $ 300000 loan!
It's a big Italian firm.
It's risk-free.
Check it. If we fail to pay,
the contract is annulled.
- We're in over our heads.
- We waited 3 months.
But I must stick to the rules.
The banking law, see?
Look for a collateral.
I'll be waiting.
We'll come up with
something.
What?! The telephone is
disconnected already.
So let's forget the office.
You scare my customers.
I'll pay when I sell the stuff.
When?
I don't know.
- Before Christmas.
- But I've been waiting
a month already.
The price was supposed
to be reduced.
The rent's gone up. Get it?
You wanna kill me?
Gerard?
Yes, it's you Gerard.
My upstairs neighbor.
Steve?
Long time no see!
- How goes it?
- I manage.
- Something wrong?
- Check your pockets.
- For you.
- No way!
Sorry.
I must've overlooked it.
Wait a minute.
If you ever look for work,
here's my phone number.
Remember the milk?
Always lifted from your door.
- That's right.
- Yes.
We'd put in a laxative.
And waited
for the ambulance.
Once they took
that TV emcee from No.9.
He crapped all over
the ambulance.
We were real stinkers!
You can't foresee it?
Go to a fortune teller.
That's a broker for you.
Italy?
What're you gonna do,
import the Pope?
Something much more
substantial.
Scooters? Here?
For the price of three
bicycles.
Beautiful.
Been looking everywhere.
Why not at the Pizza Hut?
A pal from the same block.
Meet my wife.
- Where's Kate?
- Having her pizza.
I'm coming right away.
Don't buy her any ice cream.
Beautiful.
It will sell like hot cakes.
What did Father say?
Did you ask him?
Why, he may help you.
Close your eyes.
Not yet...
- When is Mom back?
- She has a night duty.
Steve?
Good.
Wait a minute.
Guess what I'd like
to have now.
The honey we brought
from Greece.
How about
a swimming pool?
Typical symptoms.
- Is she in danger?
- No.
Either pregnancy
or losing weight.
- I asked you...
- And I told you.
Your coffee's getting cold.
They won't let her get
out of bed, anyway.
- Excuse me.
- Let me finish.
I paid the check. After all,
he was my customer.
But I asked them why so much.
A glass of Cognac for $175?
And she goes,
"The bottle is for $ 5250".
And the medium wage
is $ 360 now.
You'll soon afford it.
I've found a guy
who's interested.
A big state company.
And he's into scooters.
A motor maniac?
May I go on?
The chief exec of a mine.
And the mine will provide
a collateral.
How much is his cut?
Let's see the costs?
The exec, his senior
accountant, me,
plus
a notary, lawyers...
20% interest altogether.
Great! A Mercedes for each.
20% you say.
And we start in the red.
It's absurd.
Then you negotiate.
Here.
Call them.
You ordered the flowers?
They'll be ready at 6 p.m.
I want everything on time.
And that's that, gentlemen.
We got to sleep on it.
What was that?
They often jump
out the window.
It's worse than in jail here.
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
If guys had to lie like we,
the population would die out.
Hi, hon!
Pralines?
- He's been kicking?
- Not yet.
She isn't big at all!
- Don't throw it.
- But I want to.
A fine squirrel.
And that will hurt.
From Berlin.
They sell the best gear.
We thought it over
and we decided
that 10% is OK. With us.
All right. 12%.
- Like I said.
- Twelve's the limit.
Look...
Excuse me.
Let's wrap it up. 15%.
I can't get a word
in edgewise. 25%.
How many?
- 25%? Why?
- You said 20%.
That was last week.
The exec called.
He lost patience.
- So it's 25% now.
- You know our plight.
What can I do?
Out of the question!
Waiter, the check.
Do as you please.
And now
my costs.
What costs?
I got the exec
to come over from Spain.
I had to leave for Katowice,
hotels, power lunches, etc.
It's your ass on the line.
We got to settle accounts.
You commissioned me.
What can I do now.
Steve, you leave me
in the lurch.
What now?
Let's put up an ad.
- We should've agreed then.
- He's too clever by half.
It was you!
Wanna quarrel?
When are the wops coming?
Adam, you has-been!
They don't tell you to learn
poems by heart?
So what do they teach you?
Repeat after me:
O Lithuania, my country,
Thou art like good health;
I never knew till now
How precious, till I lost thee.
Now I see thy beauty whole
Because I yearn for thee.
O Holy Maid, who
Czestochowa's shrine dost guard
And on the Pointed Gateway
Shine and watchest
Nowogrodek's pinnacle!
As Thou didst heal me
By a miracle
For when my weeping
Mother sought Thy power,
I raised my dying eyes,
My strength returned
And to Thy shrine I trod
For life restored
To offer thanks to God.
Uncle...
- Which room is mine?
- Take your pick.
In the garage along with my bike.
Now the coordinates of
the angle and... press here.
Someone to see you.
See? You got it.
Your mom really has a way
with flowers.
Gerard, don't mix my home
with business, please.
- Hey! Watch out!
- Where can they play?
All right. Be brief.
My sister's visiting us.
- From out of town?
- Not quite.
Pretty.
As to our deal...
Easy, Gerard.
Let's meet Steve and then
talk it over.
I've added up my costs.
You owe me 6000.
You blather.
$ 6000.
My ideal man - only
in socks and with a cell phone.
You're sitting on my tights.
- Hurry up or we'll be late.
- We won't.
- No, I'm not that quick.
- You sometimes are.
Hi.
Won't you let me in?
I've come round to tea.
- Get rid of him. Who is it?
- A man I know.
- The cab's waiting.
- You go. I'll join you.
Don't wave. I'll join you.
How many rooms are here?
Two.
Green or black?
We used to have a wall here.
I don't know.
Not strong.
Good bye, mister.
Good bye.
You hit Adam.
You hit my friend.
Steve, give me the money.
I want no problems.
Let's see. Does anyone
owe you overdue debts?
What is it, Steve?
We're going to your pal.
I'm not going.
- Should I help him?
- No need. He's sensible guy.
Hey, Steve, you'll wake up
my baby!
You took baby cars from them?
How much altogether?
$ 10000.
You got invoices?
Show him.
- The dough!
- I don't have any.
You don't?
The f??? You don't!
Let go or you'll strangle him.
Wait downstairs.
Stop it.
I didn't get the money.
He said,
"I'll give everything".
All he had was $ 100.
Get the dough tomorrow.
Every day you delay -
$ 1000 extra.
You'll report to me
every day by phone.
We're going to the police.
- What will you tell them?
- He blackmails us.
- What about evidence?
- A witness.
Matczak.
- He won't tell a thing.
- Not him. You.
Cool it.
You may wake up Jola.
Those bandits will toss you
a grenade just for booze.
You believe him that
Matczak had only $100?
Does it matter?
I'll get the dough.
I'll rake it up somehow.
Let's pay him off
and things will look up.
Stop sighing! The scooters
weren't my idea.
See what you've got us into?
And you thought it would be
all sweetness and light?
What time is it?
Did you have fun?
You must've had
as you didn't join me.
You've defrosted the fridge.
Yogurt.
Butter.
Cheese. So much waste.
I buy it for you. I only eat
lettuce and apples.
- You got money?
- No.
Jesus!
Why do we talk this way?
Look in my bag. There
must be 300 in there.
And the man's name?
We got to start somewhere.
Can you guarantee
my security?
Give me his name, please.
And my security?
How can we get in touch?
My cell phone...
Forget it.
Your home number?
We'll make him understand
this doesn't go unpunished.
I don't know his name.
He's a Russian.
It's a mistake, sir.
Give me your pass.
I have to sign it.
I don't want to wind up
a cripple.
Take me away from here.
What does
"imperiled pregnancy" mean?
7 months in bed
and 20 kg overweight.
How about the kitchen
and living room together?
You can watch the kid
all the time then.
We have a big house but...
Why don't you read this?
That overweight
must've scared him.
I thought she was pregnant,
not you.
What're you doing here?
Giving birth to a grandson.
He picked me up with
a scooter too.
Osa.
No, Lambretta.
But they stole it from me.
Remember the picnics
on that meadow?
Oh those meadows,
clearings...
The bush!
This is your color, you know?
I'm worried about that credit.
Forget it.
What do you mean?
I won't get the collateral
in a week.
There's a Polish-ltalian
government fund.
I showed the folder.
They can frame it.
Go and see for yourself.
It's a real bargain.
And it still got a guarantee.
- A five-year-old car?
- Her body.
- It was repaired.
- How come?
Too late, gentlemen.
It's sold already.
We haven't decided yet.
- But we pay cash.
- Great! Come inside.
Wait a minute!
First come first served.
You're a godsend.
They were undecided.
A clever geezer.
5/20 vision. Yet he noticed
the repair.
A bite to eat?
I got some cheeses.
Where's Ann?
Mariola.
She's flown away.
I saw Gerard yesterday.
He even waved to me.
Like I said. Neither call
nor pay him.
I want you to witness...
Not that again.
You'll be my best man, chicken.
I've hooked up with a German.
So the scooters are history?
No, I'm biding my time.
Oklahoma!
Watch out! Road rage!
I've hooked up with a German.
So the scooters are history?
No, I'm biding my time.
Oklahoma!
Watch out!
I'm so grateful.
I convinced them quickly.
Given the traffic problems,
it's a good idea.
A meeting with the boss, sir.
My best regards to your dad.
We were both boy scouts.
You don't know old pals?
I'm in a hurry.
- Let's have a beer.
- I can't.
Meet Junior.
Just released from jail.
F??? It!
Too difficult?
- How goes it?
- Fine.
- But not with me.
- It happens.
It's bad when pals screw you.
Like you did me.
I got principles.
The dollar bills I got
were counterfeit.
What dollars? I don't get it.
- You sent through Steve.
- I sent no one.
Let's add it up...
The debt overdue $ 6000,
plus interest $ 1000...
for each day. Right?
$26000 altogether.
The dough tomorrow here
at this time.
The Russians would've
killed you for such a trick.
What time is it?
You don't need it.
I tell you the time.
And get the f??? Out of here!
- They were from the bank.
- Why did you pay him?
I go in to hiding.
Let's wait it out.
I'll move in with Tadeusz.
F??? It!
When the scooters pan out,
we'll get security.
I sold the Italian contract.
- Why, we got the credit.
- I've paid Gerard off.
Did you want him
to do you in?
Will you come round at Xmas?
That pregnancy wears one down.
See what I've bought?
A toaster for Mom, this for
Babs, and this for your aunt.
What a hassle!
Mind-boggling.
So... to success.
What should I wish you?
To get rid of my partner.
Gentlemen,
the Xmas party is over.
Clean up and go home.
I have a trade name
for your scooters.
We're not lying idle here.
We work hard.
Miss Ann won roller skates
for a crossword puzzle.
Who'll eat all this?
I've read half the handbook
of economics.
You know what
"price index in time" is?
What's up?
That's what I'd like to know.
Watch out or you'll bear
an accountant.
I don't care what it'll be.
All I want is bear a kid.
Will you come tomorrow?
Coming?
Adam, are you coming?
Tomorrow at 9:00 he's
grating parmesan.
You into home economics?
Come on
you want me to be jealous?
Will you wash up? Great!
Mom? It's me.
I'm in the mountains.
Who?
When did he come?
Mr. Kowalczyk?
I got telephone directories.
Leave him alone.
Leave him I said!
Why all those books?
You work for Germans. Rich.
I've seen the firm.
- They let you in?
- For the doctor I told them.
Sorry to be bothering you.
It's nice.
We're bored a bit here.
I owe Adam some money.
I was to pay off the debt
but he vanished.
- You called home?
- I went there.
His parents said
you'd know something.
I can't help you. He drops in
from time to time.
That's fine. Thanks.
A boy or a girl?
Don't say anything.
Let me guess.
A boy, right?
- Is that for me?
- Could be.
Pretty color.
Now what?
Adam vanished?
My God, they're all the same.
Mine's alike.
I haven't told you yet.
I've been watching you.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
You - a chauffeur with
your experience in business?
I'll think about a promotion.
Checks?
Only five?
That's all I could get.
You got to throw in something.
Lay of us or the boys in town
will take care of you.
Where's Adam?
I don't know.
Junior, have you seen
the picture of his chick?
A fine piece of ass.
Care to lay her?
Shall we go there?
Shall we lie down?
- What's this?
- Nothing.
I tripped over your shoes.
My shoes?
We have to part company.
For some time. We must.
You're joking, right?
Out.
Get out of here!
I told you to take the keys!
Good evening.
Yes?
- I've come to see Adam.
- He's out.
Name's Nowak. His cousin.
Tadeusz Frei. My pleasure.
Adam will be here
in a minute.
I'm with a friend.
Let him come in too.
Make yourself comfortable.
Great.
Tea's about ready.
- You study in college?
- Yes.
And you can afford all this?
I must shift as best I can.
- You a businessman?
- Second hand cars.
You fancy something?
Not registered in your name.
My friend's.
May be hard to sell.
I couldn't get Champagne.
Just a sparkling wine.
Here he comes. You got visitors.
Better eat something warm.
I'll be right back.
You vanished and left me
penniless. It's not nice.
Take a look.
May be hard on the nephew.
Go back home
and wait for my call.
You've sold me, son of bitch!
Where are you?
Home?
Come here.
I want to talk.
How long has this
been going on?
I know you have someone.
I know what I'm talking about!
Don't lie to me!
You were supposed
to stay put.
Put on your suit. We'll get it
over and done with.
I have no time.
And take your ID.
- Learn to clean up.
- Dad...
I got in trouble.
- Money again?
- It's not that.
Then I'll tell you.
How old are you?
They took me to task
for those scooters.
I'm sorry.
I wonder if you can
stay the course at all.
You were to wear a suit.
I'm not going.
Leave him alone.
I need his face.
All I want is the debt.
Pay me off and you're free.
You'll cash a check.
$25000.
In five banks.
And we get even.
This means a prosecutor
on my tail.
You'll steer clear of those.
Here.
- Am I a dog?
- I may throw it away.
- Heave a sigh of relief.
- You need a PIN to cash them.
We'll drive you home.
Give me your hand.
Gimmi I said!
Help him, Junior.
Open it.
Open the f?????? Hand!
Close it.
Close it tight.
Let go.
Let go.
Get out.
Why packed together
like sardines?
- What the f??? Is this?
- A contract.
You're selling me all this shit.
No go.
Take a good look.
A man has been stabbed
with this.
You sign it
or this incriminates you now.
I've done you a good turn.
Do you know what it takes
to build a house?
Steve!
You need a PIN to cash
those checks.
Gerard is coming to you.
Steve, you hear me?
Answer the phone!
She miscarried.
Right after she called you.
Leave her alone!
I want to talk!
Give it back to him.
You've done me in.
The deadline's tomorrow.
He's taken away my door keys.
How can I find the PIN?
It's Tadeusz.
What cousin?
He's not my cousin.
He's a thug!
How can I sell a clunker
with forged papers?
And he wants to extort interest.
$1000 for each day of delay.
Must be a psycho!
Now you're telling me?!
Fan-f?????? - Tastic!
Advertise that you put
your pals in deep shit!
Free of charge.
We gotta go to the police.
We got to.
He is right.
I'll face the music
for those checks.
He set me up with those
checks as he did you.
He coerced you.
That's what we'll tell them.
Let's go.
Got a cell phone?
Dial 911...
- Why me? You started it.
- You want to tell them.
- You aren't going?
- I've been there.
- When?
- Then.
When?
After he raided Matczak's.
And what?
They said they'd
reprimand him.
A 48-hour arrest and then
wait when he's released.
He'll take your apartment
for starters.
You won't pay him off
till your dying day.
We got to make them
scared of us!
Let's fly the coop... abroad.
Tadeusz...
I don't have my passport.
He's taken it.
- He's taken my passport.
- A Happy New Year!
Customers should be wined.
- What are they?
- Veggie growers.
Beans and tomatoes.
They're late.
Must be counting the dough.
Leave it.
It's for the visitors.
F??? It!
The flask's broken.
I'll run to get another.
Let Junior do it.
Near the gas station.
Bring one from the trunk.
The keys!
Lutoslawski? My aunt lived
close to him.
A gift from a violin player.
1st Symphony.
Conductor...
Your tickets, please!
Hi, Gerard.
You'll break my hands!
I've made a schmatte of
myself, you schmuck!
You've messed up my life!
Cool it!
- Junior is back soon.
- Hurry up.
Steve!
Squeak and I'll kill you!
- Got a flask?
- Yeah.
I've checked. None.
How come? In the trunk?
They must have it!
Why weapons?
A leash was good for you.
- Keys?
- Must be mine.
Passport.
My plot.
Gerard Nowak - President.
At long last!
Tadeusz!
Yeah, all is in order.
It's for you.
Hey, you, Nowak.
They're in our care.
Once you get here,
we may cut a deal.
Hey, you, Nowak.
They're in our care...
- They've bought it.
- We call the shots now.
- F??? It!
- Don't kill yourself.
- Hurry up. What is it?
- Nothing.
Sprained or broken!
So beat it, pal!
A road map could do...
If you don't loosen
my fetters, I'll wreck the car.
Let's drive any place.
Let's go back.
What do you mean?
You want to go back?
Suppose we did. What then?
Gimmi the keys!
Your friends are late.
Steve, he's getting you
in deep shit!
What're you gonna do?
I'll work for you!
We'll break your legs.
He made me do it!
You got no debt whatsoever!
He was cheating everybody.
I'll work for you, I swear.
Please.
Tie up his legs.
Take that wacko away!
Steve!
We can make a deal.
Have you tied him up?
Don't the f??? Move!
Throw the rope over it.
I'll break your spine.
So it's wheelchair forever.
I'll get you.
You and your f??????
What's her name...
Why, you'll have a kid...
Why the f??? Are you
staring so?
Must look like
Russkies settling a score.
We're undressing him.
You hear?
Take a shower.
Why don't you wash?
We got to tidy up.
Blood.
You got to change.
We should get rid of
these clothes.
We'll burn them
along with the car.
This is not the first time.
The radiator is cold.
Great! Turn off the water
and gas for good measure.
Thank you.
- What's the time?
- 12:00.
You slept round the clock.
Did Steve call?
I'll get you pajamas.
What're you doing?
I'll be right back.
This wacko climbed up
seventh floor on the outside.
And knocked at the window.
What's up?
She hid in the bathroom.
And pees again!
The bathroom's for peeing.
I got there from
the neighbor's balcony.
Tadeusz.
Corpses in the Vistula
Who recognizes the tattoos?
What have you dragged me in?
Ask Adam.
They haven't
identified the bodies yet.
- Some day they will.
- We got an alibi.
We're having a party
at Tadeusz's all night long.
Why the f??? Did you
cut off their heads?
To save us.
Like the Russkies do it.
A red herring.
To save me?
- But you wanted...
- Not to kill.
It was easier to break a leg!
Cool it, guys.
We got to settle
on all the details.
Our talks, drinks...
Okay.
We have to sort things out.
Let's meet here tomorrow.
Come and eat a bite.
You've buttoned it up wrong.
Any plans for the weekend?
We could drive to Granny's.
Take Babs for a walk
in the woods.
She might forget about all that.
So sorry, son.
What's that?
Where's Tadeusz?
I've found it in the door.
The cops ask for contact.
Check what they want.
I'm not interested.
They got nothing on us.
Tadeusz is in Copenhagen
already.
Why are you staring at me?
You're making a mistake.
Me?
It wasn't me who paid.
That started it.
F??? It.
You chickened out.
And you didn't, huh?
I wish you'd just told him,
"No go, Gerard".
Did you?
Steve, your cab is coming
in 5 min.
Don't stand there.
- Aren't you going too?
- For one day? What for?
Bye.
Stop it, please.
Babs...
I did a terrible thing.
I can't listen to this.
I can't.
Go.
Go!
- I won't drag you into this.
- You have.
It's my fault.
Had I listened to you then...
Adam, let's leave this place.
Go now.
I beg you. Let's leave!
- Go.
- I won't.
- I beg you.
- No!
All right.
Go and pack up.
I'll call you.
- Are you calling, mister?
- Yes, I am.
I want to testify about
