Love.
An indefinable feeling
that inspires songs and movies.
No one has ever written...
A romance about a girl who pukes
in the crap toilet of some crap bar.
They couldn't either.
I bet no writer has been in love
with a living corpse.
If you can still drink tequila
after puking your guts out...
You're hung up on someone
who ripped your heart out.
If you fall for a guy
who hasn't been near love in ages...
Give him a shake.
Because his loving side
may have sunk to the bottom.
At least you won't regret not trying.
Hey.
Suppose we go to my place
when you're done here...
And I kiss better
the sore parts of those tattoos...
One by one?
And then...
You show me the tattoos
on parts of you I haven't seen...
And you say,
'Look. It hurts here too'?
Huh?
- Do I have to answer now?
- Do I...
Take that as a yes?
She's a fast mover, boss.
Where did you find her?
I didn't.
She found us.
OK, good night.
FIG JAM "Fig Jam is Nice"
"You owe me breakfast" Duygu
"Don't forget the song playing now"
You said
everything was gonna be perfect.
You said I had a long road ahead.
Forget moving forward...
My right leg no longer
trusts the left, sweetheart.
You left me stranded
in the middle of life.
Good morning, Metin Bey.
Help yourself, Cemil.
I had breakfast earlier,
Metin Bey.
More tea, Metin Bey?
No, I still have some.
OK, take a look.
There's a ton more emails,
Metin Bey.
Welcome to them.
"Fig Jam" is the best romance movie
I've ever seen. Thanks.
- Should I answer, Metin Bey?
- No.
Is it a true story?
Should I answer, Metin Bey?
No.
What kind of screenplay is that?
You really messed with us.
There's no answer to that anyway.
More tea, Metin Bey?
Metin Bey?
Can we have a drink for the stage?
You can.
Breaking up with someone alive
is the worst kind of break-up.
If we aren't dead...
Breaking up is meaningless.
Because if we aren't dead...
Breaking up sucks.
In that case, to the dead!
So...
What?
Raki up to the wound.
Don't send me cologne again.
And be nice to customers.
They're our...
Here we go.
Good night, everyone.
Don't let him get to you.
He's a sad sack.
Be gentle with him.
It's like this, dude.
We've been together 3 months...
And only kissed.
Show me a girl like that nowadays.
Sure the problem isn't you, dude?
Listen to you!
Check her out yourself.
She'll soon be here.
Look, she's pretty,
honest, faithful, not a user.
She had one relationship before me.
It doesn't get better.
Ready?
Look.
You had her face carved in your arm
after knowing her 3 months?
It's called love, my friend.
Love.
Hey, baby!
Let me introduce you.
Asli. Metin.
- Glad to meet you.
- You too.
My screenwriter friend.
He wrote "Fig Jam", remember?
Right. Erol and I saw it together.
Actually Erol cried a lot at the end.
Baby.
Show him.
Very nice.
Excuse me! Can we get the check?
No single guys, fellas.
Selami from Box Bar
sends his greetings.
Welcome.
Let's have another bottle, gorgeous.
Can I have a napkin, honey?
I gotta question.
Is that a wig?
No.
See what it says.
The prick can't see straight.
Our second bottle would be wasted.
"My Desolate Heart".
C'mon, let's go.
I'll trash the place otherwise.
- Good night.
- Good night, Metin.
- Wanna get soup, Gizem?
- I'm too tired today. Another time.
OK. I owe you then.
You sing like my ass.
You have a fit ass then.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What the hell's going on?
Move! Don't make trouble.
Come with me.
Fight. Fight. Breaking windows.
Forced entry.
There's some mistake, chief.
Wherever there's trouble,
you're there, girl.
This time...
When I saw my boyfriend like that...
Are you together?
It's been 3 months.
Fight. Fight. Breaking windows.
Forced entry.
Is that it
after everything tonight?
My eyebrow's bleeding.
I'm not expected to take you home
and dress your wounds, right?
That only happens in the movies.
Good night.
They're asking your star sign.
Should I answer, Metin Bey?
No.
Your star sign?
You sure get some crazy people.
Cemil, can I have more tea?
I just put more water on.
Are you thinking of writing
"Fig Jam 2"?
No, we're going straight for Part 3.
People are seriously weird.
- Should I answer, Metin Bey?
- No.
Screw the emails. You need
to get a grip on yourself fast.
Look at you. Fights, alcohol...
Find yourself a nice girl.
Forget the past.
See how Asli shaped me up?
Erol, do you never stop talking?
If you're playing tonight,
we'll come watch you.
I'm not. I'll let you know.
OK.
Cemil, think the water's boiled?
Not yet.
Hey there, Scout.
Whoa, the gang's here.
What's up?
- Thought we'd check you out.
- What are you drinking?
- Beer.
- Beer.
- Are you splitting?
- I can do a couple of drinks.
Let's go then.
- Good night, Timur.
- Good night, Scout.
An occupational habit, sorry.
Are you following me?
If I was,
I'd have to sit with you, right?
Enjoy.
The 6 pack!
Let's see the 6 pack!
Good morning.
The coffee machine's under the stairs.
There you go.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Keep it dry for 2 days.
Remember to use the cream.
- Hello.
- How can I help?
I wanted to get a tattoo.
Do you have a story?
Exactly 40 years ago...
I met eyes with a girl
at a bus stop.
I'd just screwed up the courage...
To talk to her when the bus came.
She got on and was gone.
I checked my watch.
From that day on...
I waited at the stop
every day at the same time.
The day I decided it was all over
she came to the stop.
Our eyes met again.
This time I got on her bus.
If you wait 3 months at the same stop
for a total stranger...
Whose voice you haven't even heard,
I guess it's called love.
You're the most sophisticated jerk
I've ever met.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Thanks.
I wanted to get a tattoo.
Or rather have mine changed.
Changed how?
I caught him in bed with the girl
who tattooed our names for us.
Please.
When I can be bothered...
...I'll start on these letters,
Metin Bey.
Why labor over pages of letters
when you have two-line emails?
No, any day now.
Thank you so much.
What can't you share?
Nothing, Metin.
Cut the crap. C'mon, admit it.
You're betting
on how much he'll drink tonight.
- No, not this time.
- What then?
Whether Gizem
will headbutt anyone tonight.
Goddamn sharks.
We aren't racehorses.
If Metin Bey doesn't drink,
I won't headbutt anyone.
But forget singing, he can't even
say his name unless he drinks.
- I say he'll drink!
- I say she'll headbutt!
- I say he'll have 7 glasses!
- I say she'll headbutt 2 people!
I say he'll just drink whatever.
You're screwed.
I say I won't drink.
You waste your breath, Metin.
Yes, kids.
Mistakes will always come back
to haunt you.
Thank you.
Wanna grab some soup?
Just as friends.
It's stone cold.
If your son, Hope,
died of leukemia aged 2...
You might not care a lot
about how hot the soup is.
"Hope"
I'm just gonna wash my hands.
Do you have a cigarette, son?
Thanks.
Are you in love?
No, old man.
Work on it.
Good luck.
Great being taken for a spin, huh?
Now go get her.
How about a drink or two?
No way!
We took money off the guys.
- How would they know?
- We would. Isn't that enough?
Wanna a ride home?
No. I've never even been in a car
driven by a woman.
Are you macho?
- Don't say that.
- OK...
Have you ever seen
a female serial headbutter like me?
We can even take a tour.
Let's not overdo it.
That bus ride
is the only trip I've ever taken...
Without knowing where I was going,
how far and with who.
On the bus was
the greatest love of my life...
And the biggest regret.
How much time do we have?
No idea.
But making a start is enough.
Or rather finishing.
I want at least
to finish this properly...
Even if it didn't start that way.
What happened
when you got off the bus?
We knew each other for 6 months.
It was the best book I've ever read.
As far as I know...
No woman had ever asked a man
to marry her until that day.
- So did you say yes?
- Yes.
I had no money.
I'd applied to work in Germany
but was rejected.
There were other ways.
I planned to marry a German on paper...
Come back after making some money...
And marry the girl I loved.
Good morning.
Oh my God!
What's up, Metin Bey?
Couldn't you sleep?
I got up early today. Hungry?
No, I already had breakfast,
Metin Bey.
- The computer's on.
- Really?
- Turn it off if you don't need it.
- Sure I do. I'll just get a tea.
How do we get rid of these ants,
Metin Bey?
Don't kill them!
Welcome.
Thanks.
I wanted to get a tattoo
for my mother.
Do you have a story?
Yes.
Mesrutiyet Ave. No 64/6 Beyoglu
What are you expecting?
Me to turn up one day
and say I'm back?
You know it won't happen.
You're my sweetest farewell.
Look.
Look at her eyes.
She's looking at you
the way I did.
Friend!
Hey, captain!
We're busting a gut here
to hook a fish.
You get lucky
and don't even reel it in.
There's an etiquette to drinking raki.
First know who you're drinking with...
Then who you're drinking to.
Whatever you drink to must be worth it.
Drink either to pleasure...
Or to sorrow.
Don't let anyone bad-mouth
what's in the glass...
Because it can be sensitive.
And then...
Drink to an absent friend...
Who you wish was there.
C'mon then.
Good evening, Riza.
Please, Metin.
It's past 10.00.
Don't get me into trouble.
Have you seen anyone...
Turn teetotal
after drinking until 10.00, Riza?
Have a good night.
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.
So can you do a tattoo of that?
No. It's just decoration.
It would be great as a back tattoo.
Hello.
Welcome, Fikret.
Can we do a session today?
It's only been 2 days.
You need a break in-between.
- I have you down for Wednesday.
- OK.
- See you Wednesday then.
- Bye.
How to get rid of ants in the home
I could've lived with a few of you...
But you overdid it, guys. Sorry.
Greetings.
How can I help?
We wanted to get a tattoo.
What's your story?
- Gotta story?
- No.
- You?
- Nope.
In that case...
We'll think on it
and come back later.
- Have a good day.
- Goodbye.
Just one thing.
Can you do a Fenerbah√ße tattoo?
Nope.
Have a good day.
- Is that your goddamn story?
- Yes, it was.
- You were awesome again, dude.
- Thanks.
It's my first time hearing you.
You're everything they said.
Thank you.
- Hi. Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Didn't you also write
the screenplay for "Fig Jam"?
Yes.
I'd love to drink with you one night.
And get inside your head.
Kismet.
Thrilled to meet you.
Have a great night.
Caller Alptekin
Yes, Dad?
Screw that head of yours, dude.
Just see what's around you
and you're still grieving.
I swear, if Asli and I weren't serious...
- Three months is serious.
- Three months 8 days, dude.
Anyway it's motive that matters.
We had each other's tattoos done.
That's a big deal.
Gizem is a tattooist.
- Where's your place?
- Two streets down.
So have you seen Asli's tattoos?
Show him, baby.
Her seyi birak
kALPTEKINi birakma
Was it you who got the ring, dude?
She has more on her back
and her lower back.
So you haven't seen
the lower back one?
Baby, Dad just called.
We have to go.
I have to drop Asli home before 12.00.
Let's go, baby.
- Glad to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Sure. Don't be late. Good night.
You like fish?
Just as friends.
Every evening as kids...
My brother and I
used to watch out for Dad.
Soon as he was home...
We'd start yelling,
'Dad, did you get prawns?'
Was your dad a fisherman?
No, an interior designer.
- Do you just have one brother?
- Yes.
- He's the high-flyer, a lawyer.
- You?
The problem child...
The fine arts student
with a question-mark future.
You already have a job.
Why work nights at the bar?
I need to save.
I wanna move to Bodrum
and open a tattoo studio.
Why?
The city's tiring.
Every day is a battle.
Want some prawn?
Thanks.
I did wash my hands.
So who are you?
No one for ages.
My dad used to say...
He was scared of living like moss...
Of being aimless...
Just to look green.
I think you need to be someone.
For someone at least.
- When did you last touch a woman?
- You can't ask that just as a friend.
Don't always think with your dick.
When did you last break through
a woman's smile to her heart?
Or when did you watch her fall asleep
on your knee midway through a movie?
Just curious. As a friend.
Friends don't hurt with questions.
Friends hurt most of all.
Because they mean well.
They hurt...
Every time they press the wound
to stop it bleeding.
They don't hurt out of spite.
They hurt so the wound will heal.
What if it's a deep wound?
Then friends are no help.
The wound needs another heart.
Because one wounded heart...
Can only be relieved by another.
So what's your story?
He was a tattooist.
One Wednesday
he had a motorbike accident.
On Thursday I was half a person.
When you put one egg to boil
you realize that two less one is one.
You realize
when the dishes take no time...
When the pot with your one coffee
boils over in no time.
You go through all kinds of shit...
And realize when your back gets dirty
that the most unlikely detail matters.
When you have to unlock the door
with a cold key...
And the washing machine never fills,
then you realize he's gone.
Your side of the bed is warm...
For the first time
since I became no one.
- I feel like I'm betraying Duygu.
- Is that a joke?
People cheat on their girlfriends,
on their wives.
They even con themselves
that it's what they always wanted.
You've spent 2 years being faithful
to someone not alive.
What would you want
if you'd been Duygu?
- For her to live her life.
- What do you think she wants?
I don't know. My head's a mess.
Don't let it be.
You're doing nothing wrong, dude.
By the way,
if you're doing OK for cash...
Can you lend me 500 lira?
I can't find the rent
for the studio this month.
- No problem. I have money, dude.
- Thanks.
- See you.
- Good night.
Good night, Metin.
What are you running from?
I know.
You're running from today.
From tomorrow.
You're sunk in the past.
You can't breathe without it.
You're running from
being left half a person again.
We're already incomplete.
How much less can we become?
Carry on with your screaming silence!
You run from anything good.
You're full of self-pity.
You run from
anything alive and breathing.
Wanna hear a secret, man?
You can't cheat on the dead!
We lived within the boundaries
drawn for us, lover.
We had no real expectations.
They taught us to love through touch.
But it's not like that any more.
There's someone you can love
regardless of time or place.
Hug her in the street,
kiss her on the corner.
Let people see this love
and take it as an example.
Let them know
how life-affirming it is.
My heartsick sweetheart,
love so strongly...
That they think
it was worth all the suffering.
Won't you be mad at me?
I married a woman
who'd been set up in Germany for me.
My whole aim was to save some money
and come back home. Until...
My wife on paper
said she was in love with me.
I couldn't live anywhere else.
Otherwise someone would tell
and I'd be deported.
I was living with her.
I spent two years...
Trying to avoid
sleeping with my wife.
She had a drug habit.
Hey, Metin.
If you've quit your goddamn poison,
just say so.
- No, I still drink.
- So it's us you wanna f...
Spite.
- How can he have 2 drinks all night?
- How do I know?
I have a little manna from heaven.
Wanna get a drink?
If I choose where.
A friend of mine
had a birthday bash here a year ago.
I always wanted to come drink here.
It'd be kind of lame to come alone.
What are we drinking to?
The most qualified drifter among us.
It was built 1500 years ago
as a lighthouse for sailors.
Then someone else moved in
and made a dungeon for captives.
Prisoners threw themselves off
into the depths.
Someone else made a fire tower.
The place went up in flames twice
as a fire tower...
And still wasn't destroyed.
Someone else made an observatory.
As an earthquake alert
it was damaged in 2 big tremors...
But wasn't destroyed.
The roof flew off once in a storm...
It saw 5 wars,
was damaged 15 times...
And still wasn't destroyed.
If you can drink to anything else
sitting here...
Just say and we'll drink to it.
You can't cheat on the dead.
- What are you drinking?
- A beer for me.
- You have Jack Daniel's?
- Sure. Straight?
With energy drink.
Hey dude,
you could bring out an album.
No, dude.
I'm OK as I am.
This place does me fine.
- Your drink.
- Thank you.
Can you put more whisky in?
- Where did get your tattoos done?
- In Etiler. A guy called Big Cenk.
- Do you know him?
- Sure. He's a friend from uni.
The guy is truly huge, dude.
If you say so, dude.
To your happiness then.
How long has Erol been with Asli?
Three months.
- You don't like her, do you?
- Do you?
You aren't playing tonight.
And it's my day off.
So?
So, you should take me out tonight.
How is it?
- Like my mother made it.
- So you should definitely take me out.
You should tell me you fancy me...
And ask if I wanna date you.
- Why? For the toast?
- No, for me.
- So should I pick you up from home?
- Nice idea...
But not my style.
We'll meet where the action is.
- What's up? A wedding, Metin Bey?
- Check the emails, Cemil.
- Should I answer?
- No.
I have a love story
to blow your mind.
I don't want money.
Will you write the screenplay?
Should I answer?
No.
Were you expecting someone else?
Well, to be honest, yes.
A crazy girl
with a headbutting habit.
I know. She asked me to sub for her.
I couldn't say no.
Don't stop saying no to her, OK?
Sorry, I stole your friend.
Forget seeing her, I can't even call.
Cell phones take away your freedom.
Cell phones take away your freedom.
Stop!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you OK?
- Hello?
- Good morning.
Is Metin home?
- He's asleep. Who are you?
- A friend from work.
Come in. The second song's ending.
He'll be up soon.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
Let me take your jacket.
Fanmail?
Uh-huh, fanmail.
Like an email wouldn't do.
You go through.
I'll get you a tea.
Is that...
Her?
Yes.
Welcome to my grave.
Sorry about last night.
How's your friend?
My tango instructor.
OK.
He said he'd have been jealous
if his girlfriend was nabbed like that.
You hit him out of jealousy, right?
It was me there, wasn't it?
He's an unlucky guy.
I'd have done anything
to wipe the tears...
- Of my beloved when she cried.
- What happened to that woman?
So much for my shortcut to make money
and be with my beloved.
I spent 20 years in jail.
You don't look the type.
Look in the mirror.
Do you see the you
before you fell in love?
Go away.
You're the only place...
The only way I know.
In the name of God!
What breed is he?
No idea. He was a stray.
I found him
lying by my bike one day.
The way he looked at me was like
'OK, let's go.'
We hung out for months
without a leash.
He'd come and go as he pleased.
I prepared myself
for him to leave one day.
But he never did.
Anyone have any money, kids?
No.
We aren't into that any more.
Bravo.
And tomorrow's a big day.
Gizem, nuts!
What's tomorrow?
Gizem's birthday.
We bet on
how much you'd drink tomorrow.
- Really?
- Really.
Get out of here!
- What's up, dude?
- They're betting on how much I'll drink.
- Baby, I'm off to the bathroom.
- Want me to come, baby?
- You can't be serious.
- OK.
Adem, hold the fort a second.
Knock it back.
- No, I'm drinking beer.
- Do it!
Sorry. Knock it back.
- Can I take a look at your ring?
- Sure.
Does it look good on me?
Yes.
Can I see your tattoos again?
Show her, baby.
And the one on your back, baby.
Love ENGINeer
Engin.
- Alptekin.
- What are you doing?
Onur.
What's going on?
I was just wondering.
Erol's a hard name to disguise.
What are you gonna do?
Change it to profitEROLe?
Loser!
My ring!
Dumbass.
Metin, what's this about, dude?
Gone with the wind, friend.
How's it going, Scout?
Big Cenk. Metin.
God, I've had enough.
What's up, Cemil?
On the long side, are they?
I never wrote that much
to my dad back home, Metin Bey.
Happy Birthday, Scout
What did I do wrong, man?
Where did I mess up?
Duygu...
Died.
Duygu died?
Duygu died ages ago.
It's just a fish that died.
You dump someone who breathes for you
and obsess over a dead fish?
She was our fish.
I know.
I know, dammit,
and I hate knowing.
She got the fish. She put them
in the tank. And she's gone!
Please, I beg you,
tell him you're dead.
Tell him we're alive,
that we're breathing.
He only believes you,
no one else.
He treats us all like the dead.
You know, you've seen it.
Tell him I'm in love.
It was my birthday today.
I got dressed up just for you.
I painted my nails
thinking you might hold my hand.
I wore lipstick
thinking you might want to kiss me.
And all you can say is Duygu died.
For once you were honest with me, man.
If there's such a thing as feeling,
you f*cked it tonight.
Morning, Metin Bey.
Hey, you're awake.
I wrote hundreds of letters.
I never got an answer.
Years later I found out...
That I'd poured out my heart
to an empty flat in litigation.
But...
All I'd wanted...
Was to say,
'I've never forgotten you.'
Does drinking make it go away?
Nope.
It doesn't. It kills the pain.
An anesthetic of sorts.
You can't love when you're numb.
Did you love her a lot?
To love once is enough
for what you mean.
You're alone.
See that crowd behind you, old man?
Those people came to hear me.
Nicely put. That crowd.
They came to have a good time.
All they know is your name.
What more do you want?
True.
We turn to crowds...
Rather than value what we have.
I'm alone, huh?
You're alone, old man.
Look at yourself
before lecturing me.
I have people interested in me,
people who write to me...
People who want to meet me.
And you say I'm alone.
- My head's swimming.
- Sure, reading emails is easier.
It's not a cop out, Metin Bey.
They're all from the same person.
Who?
Scout. Scout. Scout.
I watched a film one day.
I saw your pain.
I saw my pain on the screen.
I was at your door day after day.
I saw youleave home.
I saw how you looked at people,
how you walked.
You were justlike me.
There was nowhere you needed to go.
You didn't look at people's faces.
You weren't looking for anyone.
You weren't wearing a watch.
Time didn't matter.
You were going wherever
like nobody.
There was no one for you anyway
where you were going.
You were quiet wherever you went,
just like me.
You had nothing to say.
Open your mouth and you'd curse.
You looked at everyone like strangers.
You think it was chance
me getting a job at your bar?
And dealing with a bunch of dipsos
every night?
You're right, I already had a job.
What would I want at a bar?
I wanted you.
It was hard not to kiss your wounds
outside the police station today.
That hurt.
But you'd have recognized me
the moment I touched you.
You'd have known
I was wounded like you.
When I called by this morning
I saw my love piled up by the door.
All unread. That's encouraged me
to write more openly, man.
You asked once why I call you 'man'.
They're a rarity, so when you find one,
you should tell him so.
When you looked at a dead fish today
I gave up on you, man.
We, the living,
have nothing more to give you.
This is my last letter.
I came to you
with my wounds dressed.
You don't even know
where your wounds are.
I had everything in my pocket for you
except goodbye.
You snuck that in when I was asleep.
Goodbye.
If you fall for a guy
who hasn't been near love in ages...
Give him a shake.
Because his loving side
may have sunk to the bottom.
At least you won't regret not trying.

We forget that first encounter.
Where we first kissed.
The first time we held hands.
What they were wearing
when we first met.
In a word we get used to love.
But wasn't love what they wore
the day we first saw them?
The day we get used to it, we lose.
Everyone has a story.
Some etch their story on paper...
Others in their flesh.
The story ends when the paper burns
or the flesh is buried.
You can be patient for 40 years...
But sometimes life begrudges you
5 seconds to say sorry.
FOR RENT FROM OWNER
Would love you
to play "Bodrum Bodrum".
I wanna move to Bodrum
and open a tattoo studio.
- The house is in your hands, Cemil.
- Won't you be back, Metin Bey?
I don't know.
Shall I answer the emails?
Yes.
Good decision, Metin Bey.
You should follow your heart.
But don't screw up.
Write proper answers.
OK.
Shela?
I have a story.
Will you do the tattoo?
Do you believe in it enough
to get the tattoo done?
I stand by every needle
that sinks into my body.
We have invisible wounds
that can't be kissed better.
Whether from a mother, a father
or a lover.
We have memories that hurt,
that reduce us to a whisper.
The person leaving or causing heartache
doesn't have to die.
We get wounded by somebody.
We stick imaginary Band-Aids
on our real wounds.
We attribute all the pain of the past
to the next heart.
It's then that we lose.
Every morning life begins again,
we learn to breathe again.
The most precious thing in life
is the breath we take.
If you fall for a guy
who hasn't been near love in ages...
Give him a good shake.
Because his loving side
may have sunk to the bottom.
Because life is too much
to live alone.
Is this a true story?
Yes.
