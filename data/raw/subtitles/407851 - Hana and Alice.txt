It's cold
I'm freezing!
It's empty
Of course, at this hour
It's even weird we're here
Stay awake!
I'm sleepy!
Where are we going?
School
Where are we going?
School
Hey!
Are we getting on?
No
That was closing!
I almost got squashed!
Why are we here?
Isn't that guy cool?
Which one?
Left
Behind?
Well?
I'll bet they're brothers
They don't look alike
Sure they do
They don't even know each other
See? Brothers
Just friends
They get on at Fujiko
You can have the younger one
No, thanks
Is he a foreigner?
Half-Japanese
He'd be scary if he wasn't
He's cool!
He's wearing a pink shirt!
Cool!
You have the kid brother
I don't want him!
It's freezing out there
I don't want to go out
Maybe it's hay-fever season...
It's about that time
Oh, I saw 'Hannibal'
on satellite last night
So did I
I was scared
Isn't he creepy?
Yeah
Don't you think real people are scarier...
than zombies and ghosts?
Yeah
Stalkers and so on...
He looks like someone
Who?
I don't know...
Tom Cruise?
What?
DiCaprio?
You mean him?
Hannibal?
Are you sick?
No, but...
I started thinking about
that movie yesterday
'Hannibal'...
You OK?
Heart-broken, maybe
Huh?
You said he looked like Hannibal
You said he looked like someone
I'm getting all split ends
I should cut it all off
I wouldn't
You like it long?
I like it short
You're not making sense
And what's this guy
talking about, anyway?
'... Princesses-Ponpokopi-And-
Ponpokona-Live-Forever-Jack'
No, don't...
Hana!
What's wrong? Heart-broken?
Soutenu, forward, side...
Hana, get your leg up!
I told you!
Come on! You're still young!
OK, that's it
That's all for the barre
Stretching, five minutes
Five minutes?!
Let's take a break
How were your high-school
entrance exams?
Did you get into a high school?
Yes!
Yeah? Which one?
Fujiko. With Yayoi
Me, too
Akatsuka
Tezuka
Tezuka?
Congratulations!
Come on, start stretching!
So what about ballet?
That is a problem...
I want a life!
Yeah!
It's just about time
All of you!
Alice!
Nagayo!
Hana!
From me to you!
I guess I can't quit now

The uniform sucks!
Yeah
Your collar's crooked
So's your tie
Get it right!
Perfect!
It sucks
Why are you running?
Wait!
We'll be late!
Oops!
The storytelling club? That way
Back there
Next, please
Wow!
A girl wants to join our club, eh?
A sign of the apocalypse!
I'm 'Ataro The Crazed'
My real name means 'Leaky Swamp'
so I changed it to 'Crazed', eh?
And him...
he's 'Goro The Bang'
His real name is, uh...
'Goro Explosion'?
'Miyamoto'. Masashi Miyamoto
Is that your name, Bang?
What a laugh, eh?
What's your name?
Hana
'Hana'? As in 'flower'?
OK, then...
'Hana The Sweetie'
No, 'Hana The Funky'!
Which one?
'Sweetie'?
You're kinda funky, eh
Let's call you that
Right, everyone?
'We just had a boy' 'Congratulations'
'I'd like Your Holiness
to give him a lucky name'
'lf he's my son, he won't be too bright'
'How about 'Live-Forever'? '
'Why 'Live-Forever'? '
'He may not be too bright... '
'but at least he'll have a long life'
'Would it help if he had
a long name, too? '
There's no balls in it, Bang!
The audience'll fall asleep!
Aw, man!
I tell him and tell him and
he never gets better!
Mr. Miyamoto?
Mr. Miyamoto! Are you OK?!
You smashed your head
on that garage door!
Who are you?
Oh, no!
Amnesia!
Amnesia?
Do you remember your name?
My name?

I remember
You are hurt!
I'm fine. I was just checking my memory
My name's Masashi Miyamoto
I'm fine
What about me?
Remember me?
No
Oh, no!
You sure?
Oh, you're the new Grade-10 girl
What's my name?
Uh, sorry...
You said you loved me
No, I didn't
Yes, you did! You did!
I did?
Oh, no!
You really do have amnesia!
What are we gonna do?!
I really can't remember
Could you describe the
circumstances for me?
About when I said I loved you...
if I really did
You did
Could you tell me more about it?
Well, I'm not the one who said it
I don't mind waiting till you remember
Mr. Miyamoto...
Anyway, how's your brother?
My brother? I don't have a brother
Didn't you tell me you did?
No, I didn't
He looks foreign
Foreign?
Last year you both took the train
Oh, you mean Dave...
Dave?
A foreign student who
stayed at our house
Where's he from?
America. He went home
I wonder how he's doing...
You remember him, but not me...
Sorry
Toilet
Who's that?!
What?
Please! You didn't see anything!
Why? What's there to hide?
Who is he? Where'd you meet him?
You didn't see him?
I saw him. Who is he?
You don't remember?
No
Do I know him?
He's in my club
Then how should I know him?
Yeah
Yeah... I guess not
I've got to get back
Hana!
There's something lacking
Are we really 'going out' or what?
What's wrong?
You're the one who said you liked me.
Yeah...
You realize that?
Yes
No, you don't
Yes, I do
You don't
Not in your heart
That's what's lacking
I don't know whether I love you or not
And you don't remember saying
that you loved me
What does that make us, I want to know
Lovers?
I don't know...
See what I mean?
But lately I get the feeling that I like you
...I think
Really?
Yeah. I dream about you all the time
What dreams?
I can't say
Tell me!
Maybe they'll come true
I dream that the police take you away
I hope that doesn't come true
It's after me!
Another one!
When I activate the virus scan
it goes all weird
How?
I can't access the internet
Let me check it
Really?!
All these flowers...
It's like a florist
Can I talk to you for a minute?
You like shopping, or are you
running away from home?
I'm sorry, just kidding
I work for a talent agency
Here's my card
'Paper Company'
We get people work in films, TV, stage
Excuse me...
Hello?
Hana?
I can't hear you...
Guess what!
I've just been scouted!
'Scouted'? What do you mean?
They want me to come to their office!
Oh yeah?
Come with me
What?
When?
Now
I can't
It's in Harajuku
I can't, I said
Sure you can!
Look, we're grown up now
We're not glued to each other
I mean, we're still friends, but...
OK. I won't call again
Hello? Alice?
Hello?
Come on, Alice! That's not fair!
What happened?
Something's wrong...
Have you had that dream again?
About the police?
No
Lately I dream about slugs
What kinda dream is that?
There's a huge slug chasing me
I run like hell...
and I finally get to where I think I'm safe
When I turn around...
A slug?
No, you
But for some reason I don't know
who you are
So I ask, 'Who are you? '
And you say...
...'I'm a slug'
I turn around...
...and you are a slug
It sure has been raining a lot lately
Um...
...when will I see you again?
Hm?
Yeah...
What's wrong?
Nothing
The light's changing!
Made it!
Mr. Miya?
What's wrong?
96a. Are you OK?
I'm fine
Mr. Miya?
I need to talk to you
What about?
You have a computer, don't you?
Yeah...
Turn it on
It's on
Press...
...'Command' plus 'F'
Yes
Command, F
Then input...
Who's that, Masa? Your girlfriend?
Input j, u, g, e, m
Now 'Return'
I did
See anything?
Yes
Now double-click, Command 'A',
double-click
Double-click, Command 'A',
double-click...
What are those pictures?
I checked their dates
It was before we met, right?
Why do you have them?
Did I really say I loved you?
Yes
Tell me the truth
Who are you?!
There's a girl named Tetsuko
Arisugawa in Grade 10D
She took them
Do you remember?
No
Your ex-girlfriend
Bullshit!
It's true
But you only went out with her
because she forced you
That's when I came along
It was love at first sight
That's what you told me
She found out about it
and started stalking you
She took these pictures
and sent them to me...
...as a kind of threat
But I'd started to like you, too
So I didn't let her frighten me,
and I loved you right up till now
Bullshit
It's true
You're awful!
Peeking into my computer...
You've never trusted me
Not really
That makes me sad
I'm sorry
Excuse me...
What?
Is Tetsuko Arisugawa here?
Alice!
Um...
...are you Tetsuko Arisugawa?
What do you want?! We broke up!
Go away!
We're not friends any more
OK
I mean it! Not friends or anything
If we see each other,
we don't even speak
OK
But why do I have to be the ex-girlfriend
Thank you!
I can't breathe!
Where?
Here?
Take it!
An arabesque?
OK?
Nagayo! Nagayo!
Yeah, that's cute!
That hurts!
No, don't!
OK
We should smile
The one with her legs open
widest at the top
Like that?
Good?
Here goes...
Toes together...
Looking where?
Say 'cheese'!
This is hard!
Relax!
This is the last one
Quick, take it!
Thank you so much
Alice...
Fu...
Are you alone?
Yeah. You too?
Yeah
Where's Hana?
We're not friends any more
You're not?
Did you have a fight?
Order number 7 is ready
You shouldn't fight!
It wasn't a fight
I eat a lot
There's so much to choose from!
Sorry
Oh, hello!
Um...
...she lives next door
Oh
Hello
Hello, 'Hana'
Hello
Uh, Hana...
Good-bye
Good-bye, Hana
Good-bye
Good-bye
Bye bye
Good-bye
She didn't even touch her food
What are you having? This looks good
I'll have that, then
I'm back
Tetsuko?
What are you making?
Today we have sukiyaki
I'm sorry. I already ate
Sorry
I'm beat...
Come on, Mom!
How can I eat sukiyaki alone!?
Why did you make it?
I see...
You're mad at me
That's right
Have some!
I'll eat the meat
If I have sukiyaki there has to be meat
I don't mean to stick my nose in...
but you're an adult
If he's not talking marriage,
don't get serious
The yen's gone down again
Where's Alice?
I don't know
Is she OK?
Dunno
No?
Hana and Alice aren't friends...
any more
Really?!
Did you have a fight?
No
Alice told me
You keep your mouth shut, Fu
You shouldn't fight, Hana
You shouldn't fight, Hana!
We're not!
Do you believe me or Fu?
Fu
...so everything that lives
is wounded in some way...
Sorry to cut you off...
This is a variety show
I dig where you're coming from
in your approach to life...
but if that reasoning takes you
into a dark place...
Oh, I'll be very cheerful
when I talk about it...
Tetsuko Arisugawa,
from Paper Company
Nice to meet you
You too
Could you tell us what sort of things...
you've appeared in before?
Nothing
I see...
What's your philosophy at 15?
Do you have one?
'Philosophy'?
A way you like to live...
I don't know...
But you really would like to do this,
wouldn't you?
Yes
I'll be firing lines at you a lot in this
Can you handle that?
I don't know...
You don't know...
Why do you want this?
You were with the...
Ground Self-Defense Force?
Do you have a philosophy
that you live by?
'Don't brood, act'
I'll never get that role
Where?
Where did you come from?
Kanagawa
I mean your agent
Paper Company
They're not very good
Scouted?
Yes
Paper Company, huh?
They're lousy
They are?
Very natural
Perfect
A cute young girl like you'd
see anywhere
Look at her eat!
She hates chocolate?
Scene 82, in the Sodom
underground passage
Masami...
My name's Tetsuko
That's your role
Akiko...
'What do I do? '
'I know... I'll blow something up'
Kazuo, if you could lay down here...
And Yuji...
Forward
Akiko... around here
And Masami here
I'm nervous!
Ready? And...
Go!
Yuji! Where are you?!
Here!
I can't see!
Hang on!
I've got a flashlight!
There's someone here!
Masami?
Wake up!
What do I do?
What's wrong?!
It's a corpse!
OK! OK!
OK!
OK!
Thanks
Once more?
No, I'm OK
That's fine, then?
Thank you
Well done
No?
Yes...
Thank you
Yes
Thank you
I'll keep trying
Yes
A high-school entrance gift
I don't know what's popular now
That's what we got when I was in school
Whether we used them or not
Stick it in the back of a drawer
and take it out sometimes...
and think
I was given that'... and then put it back
At least it'll remind you of when
you started high school
Use it that way
A good-luck charm
Can I use it?
All you like
But soon you'll run out of
extra ink cartridges
It's a nuisance having to buy them
Then you'll probably stop
using it anyway
So what good is it?
Well, if you think of it as a gift...
It'll be harder to throw out
That's why they last so long
They're tough, fountain pens
Tezuka High School?
Is it co-ed or a girls' school?
Co-ed
Sailor uniform?
Blazer
I wish you'd worn it
Letch
What?
Letch?!
Please enjoy
Good, huh?
Yes
How's the school?
Not bad
Sweet-bean fruit cocktail
Excuse me...
Sweet-bean fruit cocktail
and seaweed pudding
They have that?
I'll have the pudding, too
Certainly
Don't you hate that?
That was years ago
I've never understood why
you have to take calculus
And Confucius, too. It's Chinese
If you have to study Chinese grammar
They should teach you
how to speak it, too!
I used to do business in Shanghai
Chinese would be useful to learn
One?
Yes
OK?
Stick it back in
Good
Take it by the corner
Shazam!
We played cards at the seaside once...
We did?
Yes!
The cards would've blown away
They did
They did?
Hello?
I'm sorry, no
'Wong'?
I'm not Wong
We just found this cell phone
No, I'm not a friend
Uh...
not... friend
Hello?
I'm afraid not
The owner of this cell phone
must have dropped it
Can you contact the owner?
You are Chinese, too?
Thank you
He's Chinese
Was that Chinese?
Hello?
Is this your phone?
In Kamakura
I'll take it to the police box
Thanks
We'll turn it in
We've done a good turn
Do they still teach Chinese
classics in school?
Yeah. We just had a test
The grammar?
That was on the test
You know how they say 'I love you'?
Wo ai ni
Wo ai ni
When will I see you next?
Hmm... I'll phone you
When?
I'll call
I'll e-mail you
When did you get to learn e-mail?
Not long ago
Letch
Why?
See you
Grab that seat
What was that Chinese?
Wo, wo...?
Wo ai ni
Wo ai ni...
Bye
Dad...
Wo ai ni
Zai jian', you should say
'See you again'
Think of the saddest thing in your life
There must be something
I'm sorry
OK, try and think of a sneeze
Doesn't that make your eyes
get wet around the edges?
I'm sorry
That's fine, then
Thank you
Saute, passe, saute, passe, saute,
pas couru, arabesque, saute...
...pique, pique, jet, jet, jet
pique, pique, jet, jet, jet, pose
OK?
You got it?
Saute... stop, and arabesque!
Jump! Higher!
Get ready!
Saute...
Stop... arabesque!
Jump!
Jump... get ready...
Leap! Higher! Higher!
I hurt my leg
Let me see
Here?
Ow!!
Hana!
Are you OK?
Come on, let's do the fouettes...
What's the matter?
You shouldn't fight!
I don't have any pain...
but a part of my memory
hasn't come back
Doctor?
Wait!
Didn't we used to go out?
We used to go out, didn't we?
Yeah, we did
Hana! Your phone
It's a guy
Hello?
Alice? How's your leg?
It's that guy again!
What guy?
Your guy!
No! Mr. Miya?
Yeah!
What does he want?
I just wanted to check
Why is he asking me
if I went out with him?
He should know!
What's wrong with him?
Didn't I tell you?
He's got amnesia
He's got what?
Amnesia'! A M N E S I A
You're kidding!
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you knew
I didn't!
And I never thought he'd be
wandering around here
What do I do now?
For now just pretend you
used to go out with him
He's lost his memory, so he
doesn't remember any of it
So just make it all up
I'm sorry
What you were saying?
Huh?
Uh...
You might find this hard to believe...
but I...
have amnesia
What?!
You're kidding!
Remember here?
We had our first date here
You don't remember?
No
How seriously were we...
...in love?
Gee, I don't know...
But...
...I loved you
Tell me more
Different things
Like what?
What did I call you?
Alice
Alice?
Yeah
And you?
What did you call me?
What?
Remember, I was good
at reading palms?
You've got a really wavy life-line
I still do onomancy, too
Remember? It's been so long!
Write your name
Boy, this takes me back!
Write your name
I'll tell your fortune
'MIYAMOTO MASA... '
What were we talking about?
What you called me
Mark
'Mark'?
Mr. Miyamoto at first. Then Mr. Masashi
Then Masashi, Masa, and finally 'Mark'
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
Mark...
But I guess I can't call you that any more
Tell me more
Lately I think about you all the time
When I do...
...for some reason...
...my heart starts pounding
That's love, I think
What do you think?
That's love, isn't it?
If it really was love...
...that'd be proof that we used to go out
Maybe my memory's starting
to come back
But why did I dump you
and start liking Hana?
That I don't understand
You'll remember
I just...
...don't understand it physically
To tell you the truth about Hana,
I don't really...
You don't like her?
It's not that...
It's like...
...she's not the type of girl
I would approach
But you did. And then
you came to hate me
I wonder if that was really me...
It's like there's...
...another me somewhere
This tree!
Remember this?
It's where we first kissed
It's raining
It's like we've gone back to that day
I don't remember at all
That's great
I wish I could forget
Mark...
Hey, you!
Hey! You OK?
Hey!
You all right?
You OK?
Excuse me! What happened?
Mr. Miya!
Your friend?
Are you OK?!
He should be OK!
Mr. Miya!
