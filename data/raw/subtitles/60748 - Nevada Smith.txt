Mornin', son.
Mornin'.
We're a little off our course.
There's a played-out mine
somewheres around here.
Know of it?
There's a lot of old mines
around here.
This one is bein' worked
by a fellow name of Sand.
Samuel Sand.
He's my father.
You don't say, boy?
Well, son,
your pappy and me,
we hunted buffalo
together in the army.
We thought it only decent
to stop by and say howdy.
About three miles on,
the second canyon,
you pick up the trail
going west.
You'll see the buildings plain.
You have a first name, boy?
Max.
Much obliged, Max.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Now you keep out of this, squaw!
Now, where is the gold?!
You tell me,
where is the gold?!
Take it easy, easy.
Come on, Sam.
Sam... it ain't
no use holdin' out.
There ain't no gold, Jesse.
When you gonna get that
in your stupid head?
Now, look!
You're working
a so-called dead mine
but you brought it
back to life.
Now, you found something
you're sittin' on
real cute-like, right?!
Would l be living like this?
You understand, we don't want
all of it, just half.
Of nothin'!
Oh, you've been
spreadin' gold dust
around Owl Creek
like snow!
That were a day's
work, that's all.
You paid your store bill
with a solid gold nugget.
l've been working two years--
one nugget, $38.
Wouldn't even pay for
the shovels l wore out.
Look, we didn't ride
all the way out here to argue.
You're going to tell us
where it is, Sam,
or you're going to tell us
with your dyin' breath!
Now, where is it?!
Whoa, boy, easy...
Well, ain't that
right handsome beadwork?
You fashion it yourself, squaw?
Yeah, it's been 1 5 years
since l skinned
an injun, squaw man!
But l ain't forgot the way.
Please... leave her be.
l tell you,
there ain't any gold.
l swear it, none.
l'm not afraid.
Max...
they're both dead.
No, there's nothing
you can do now.
Max!
Max, stay out of there.
For God's sake, stay out!
Max, come on into town with me.
They don't even look
like people anymore.
Their sufferin's over.
l don't want anybody
to ever see them
lookin' like that... ever.
Go away.
Leave me alone, please.
Gid'up.
My... God!
Max, you poor child.
Now, you come live with us.
Now l mean it.
l can't.
We've got acres of land
and a lifetime of work.
l've got to find
those three men.
And if you do?
Revenge isn't God's way.
Oh, save
your preachin', Ben.
But you're only a boy.
They're hard and vicious men.
Get 'em, Max.
You go get 'em.
Elvira...
Well, why not?
lf he doesn't, who will?
The law!
The law-- what law?
Max...
at least wait a day, rest up.
Maybe l can catch 'em
with that gray horse
before they sell it.
Here... here, Max.
Miss McCandles, l got a rifle,
a horse and eight dollars.
lt'll hold.
Well, then, good luck.
Don't forget the way back.
l'll remember you both
for your kindness.
Larry!
Who the hell are you?
My name is Max.
Max Sand.
Just a kid.
lndian.
Half-breed.
You alone?
Spit it out-- quick!
l was following three men
who killed my mother and father
and l thought you were the ones.
Are we the ones?
No.
How long have you been tracking
these killers?
Three, four days.
When did you eat last?
Couple of days ago!
Pick up the horses...
and join us.
Hey, kid.
Why don't you go home, huh?
l mean, while you
still have a chance.
Don't have a home.
Hey, how can you guys
be so friendly?
After what l tried to do?
Well, everybody in this world
is foolish in his own way.
Besides,
we were all kids once ourselves.
Weren't we now?
Don't move, mister!
Now turn around...
with your hands up.
Now, all l want
is some food and a horse.
l haven't seen
one of them old guns in years.
Keep away.
lt won't work, you know.
l said stay back!
Well, the barrel's all rusted
up, and the hammer's broke.
And besides,
they haven't made ammunition
for one of them
things in ten years.
You want to trade?
l could use something to eat.
You've been through about 25
pounds of food in three days.
You think you're ever
going to get filled up?
Oh, l'm sorry.
l didn't think.
l know it's a long ways
to haul food.
Well, finish it up,
if you can.
l can.
l didn't expect you
to be so generous.
Think l was going to throw you
to the coyotes?
You had every right.
l meant to kill you if l had to.
You an old hand at killing?
l killed my share
of deer and... rabbits.
Ever hold a gun on a man?
No.
You're setting out
to kill three of them, huh?
Bang, bang, bang.
You figure
you're going to make it
'cause you got right
on your side?
lt helps.
They bury a sheriff
about once a week out here.
Well, l just figure
it's a matter
of me killing them
before they kill me.
Now, you want to show me
some of this fancy gun work?
Turn around and face the sun.
Hit that.
Go on home, boy.
Take the shortcut.
The sun was in my eyes,
and l wasn't expecting it.
You expect a man's going
to hold still for you
with the sun at your back,
then give you a warning
so you can stand there
and shoot at him?
l can hit a rabbit
at 80 yards with a rifle.
A rabbit don't shoot back.
How do you think you're going
to swing a rifle in a barroom?
l never been in a barroom.
Look, just to find them,
you're going to have to comb out
every saloon, gambling hall,
hog farm and whorehouse
between here and Mexico.
What do you think you're after,
three preachers?
You going to gun
them down at 80 yards
when they're coming
out of a church social?
You're hunting
three men who steal
because they're
too damn lazy to work
and they kill
because they love to.
Then they hide out
like rats in the garbage.
So if you're going to get them,
you're going to have to eat,
drink and wallow
in that garbage right with them
till you get so you think
like them and smell like them.
l'll do what l have to do.
lt ain't that easy, kid.
Finding them is one thing,
killing them is another.
l'll figure out ways.
Ah.
Well, l've been selling guns
and ammunition
to men like that for 1 5 years
and they got more ways
to cripple and kill a man
than you ever dreamed about.
They'll shoot you in the back,
they'll ambush you--
they'll cut your throat
while you're laying asleep.
All you got going on your side
is some blind lndian revenge.
l'm half-white.
And you're all helpless.
Now, you get so you can do that
with either hand--
and you're half-drunk
or half-awake,
or inside of a dark room
off the back
of a running horse--
you might stand a chance.
A small chance.
Would you teach me?
l sell guns,
l don't teach killing.
Then l'll learn myself.
You won't live that long.
Well, thank you
for the food
and advice, Mr. Cord.
l guess l'll be on my way.
Where to? How? What with?
You know, if l did teach
you something,
that's only half of it.
While you're looking
for them three men
you gotta live, don't you?
You gotta eat.
You need clothes, food, horses,
saddles, guns,
ammunition, money.
How are you gonna get that?!
Tracking beaver on Sundays?
l'll tell you how you get it.
You'll wind up stealing
and killing.
You'll turn yourself into
the same kind of animal
you're trying to track down.
Can't you see that?
l don't see nothin'...
except my father laying
on a blood-covered floor
all burnt and cut
with the top of his head
blown to pieces.
And my mother...
split up the middle
and every square inch
of her skin ripped off.
Well...
God help us.
Pick up that brass.
Them cartridges cost
a cent and a half apiece.
Sit down.
Little poker suit you?
Well, not too much.
You know how
to play cards, don't you?
No.
l guess l can teach you.
Have a drink.
Well, l...
You don't drink either?
No.
Where you're going,
you'd best study up on it.
Now, the lowest hand
you can get
is a pair--
that's two of a kind.
Then two pair
and three of a kind,
then a straight.
Three of what kind?
Three of anything--
three nines, three tens,
three jacks.
Which ones are the tens?
Don't you know
how to read?
Well, l never went to school.
Know how to write?
Well, if l know how to write,
l'd know how to read.
Anything you can do?
Reach.
That's an awful waste
of good whiskey.
Where you were goin',
you wouldn't need whiskey.
All right.
A ten has got ten spots on it.
You can count that far
on your toes.
Max...
Listen, you take it
easy around here.
lt's just a quiet town.
l know people,
l do business with them.
Well, all right.
But listen, Mr. Cord,
if you happen to see...
Yeah, l know, if l see
anything suspicious
like a horse
with an ''SS'' brand,
l'll come get you.
Here's a buck--
go buy yourself some candy.
Yes, sir, can l help you today?
Can of peaches.
A big can, please.
Best Eastern peaches
in the West.
Would you open it for me?
No charge.
Hey, you got a book
that teaches you
readin' and writin'?
McGuffey's Primer,
right under the stairs.
Hey, uh...
Of course, you can't pick
one out until you can read,
and you can't read until
you can pick one out, can you?
lt's this here one.
Or, as McGuffey would
say, ''this one here.''
That's 25 cents for the peaches
and ten cents for the book.
Funny, isn't it?
ldeas don't weigh much,
but peaches do
and the freight company
charges by the weight.
You know, six books, it's...
oh, it isn't
very important.
Most people are hungrier
in their stomachs
than they are in
their minds anyway.
Well, there's
your first decision:
Now, that sign on the top
says ''Silver City.''
That's over in Colorado.
And the second one--
the one over there--
that's ''Donner, ''California.
The one on the bottom, see,
that says ''Sonora.''
That's down south
in Old Mexico.
l-l sure can't tell you
which way to go,
but you want to catch 'em,
you best go
where the money is.
lf they got it,
they're going to head
for where they can spend it.
lf they ain't got it,
they'll go where
they can steal it.
Mr. Cord, l...
l just don't know how
l'm ever going to be able
to pay you back for all this.
No need to.
l tell you what,
you get tired of chasing them,
you look me up,
and we'll talk about it,
all right?
Well, no use drawing this out.
Good luck, Max.
Bang, bang.
Yeah...
Very nicely done.
You know, handlin'
one of these things
is only half of it.
The other part's
learning human nature.
That's going to take you
the rest of your life,
so you damn well better not
trust anybody till you do.
Now, you want
to plan your moves,
pick your place to fight,
don't make any threats...
and don't you ever walk
away from one, you hear?
Good-bye, Max.
Bye, Mr. Cord.
Don't even trust a friend.
Hyah, hyah.
Hyah, hyah.
Hyah, hyah, hyah.
Hyah.
Come on, Struther,
you've washed
your little, thin body enough.
Look how white l am.
Struther, please hurry up.
Hey, the dames are comin'! Hey!
Hey, the dames are coming!
Struther,
you'd better hurry up
and get out of there.
They're comin' up here.
Hank!
Red!
Cat got your tongue?
Well, come on.
-Gee, you're cute.
-Wal-Walter.
-Walter? How are you, Walter?
-Howdy... ma'am.
Hey, look at me!
Want to come downstairs
and have a drink?
-Hey!
-Shut up.
What's the matter with me?
Whoo!
Hey, don't be
backin' off like that.
Hey, hey, one of you...
Well... well...
Hey, l'm in the tub.
Hello, cowboy.
Welcome to town.
Try the next room.
White women more popular.
Well, they saved me for you.
Navajo?
Kiowa.
l am Kiowa, too.
Well, yes or no?
Five dollars...
...for some questions.
l'm lookin' for three men,
they ride together.
And one of them--
the name is Jesse--
got a scar on his neck,
carries a knife.
May be riding a gray horse.
You ever seen
any people like that?
Lots of men
come through here,
lots of men with scars.
Buy yourself some moccasins.
Why do you ask for them?
They tortured
and killed a woman...
Kiowa, like you.
One man...
...has a... scar here.
He works downstairs
dealing cards in the bar.
Oh, but he might not be
the same man.
Where does he keep his horse?
ln the stable across the street.
But, please,
don't tell anyone l told you.
Hey, mister?
Yeah?
That gray for sale?
l don't think so.
Belongs to Jack Langley
over at the Palace Bar.
l don't think
he'll sell him, though.
l'll open for 20.
l'll have to call you.
l'll call at 20.
Call.
No more bets.
Jesse.
Any cards, boys?
You!
Dealin' cards.
Jesse who?
''Jesse Coward.''
''Jesse Murderer.''
''Woman killer.''
Now, wait a minute,
my name is Jack Langley.
When you killed
my mother and father...
it was Jesse.
Look, l'm Jack Langley.
Where did all this killin'
take place, boy?
Hey, Hudson, what's my name?
Jack Langley.
How long l worked here?
Year, year and a half.
Anything else?
Stand up!
Now look, l'm not armed.
My father wasn't armed
when you tied him to a post
and blew the top
of his head off.
Now, kid, settle...
l know what l'm doin'!
He's ridin'
my father's horse.
l'm ridin' my own horse.
With an ''SS'' brand.
Look, l bought that horse.
l have a bill of sale
for it in my room.
Fair enough.
Let's see it.
Now look, son...
if Langley here
did what you said,
l'll sit on him
and let you kill him.
But if he's got
a bill of sale upstairs,
you could have the wrong man.
lt's happened before.
Let's look.
Come on, both of you.
You fight like your mother, boy.
Should have taken you
to a sailmaker
to get stitched up.
That McGuffey reader
inside your shirt
kept that knife
away from your stomach.
Kid, the minute you get off
that table, you'll move on.
How can he move on?
How can he ride a horse
with all them stitches in him?
That's up to him.
Kid, you killed a man--
as you tell it,
for good reason.
Now, you did
what you had to,
and that's what l'm doin'.
lf we don't drive you out,
there'll be more killin'.
You got any friends?
No.
There's an lndian dance hall
girl been askin' about you.
Maybe she can help.
Where...?
How did you get...?
You come back to us
in trouble... and in pain.
You are welcome.
How long?
Many days.
You talk in fever
of the death of your father,
and Tabinaka,
my brother's daughter.
You stay here
with your own people.
Neesa--
she became shame of Kiowa.
But she bring you home.
That's good.
Maybe both of you
make each other well.
You stay here.
Oh, no!
You get right back
in there.
lt's hot water,
and it's good for you.
''See...
''See the frog... on a log.
''Rab sees the frog.
The frog...''
Three weeks, you sit here,
you never laugh,
you never smile.
''Can the frog see Rab?
Rab can't...''
You learned to read
not to make you wise,
but to help you
find men to kill.
''The frog can see the dog.
Rab ran at...''
Do you think that l became
a dance hall girl
because l was bad?
lt was because
l was full of hatred
and foolish.
''See the lamp.
lt...''
lf there was a medicine
that would change
the way l was,
l would take it.
Do you know of one?
Neesa, it ain't got
nothing to do with you.
Honestly, nothing.
lf l could find a medicine,
l'd take it myself.
Really?
For true.
See... the... lamp?
lt... is... out.
lt ain't gonna work, Neesa.
Why?
'Cause l'm gonna
have to go soon.
When?
One morning l'll be gone.
Make yourself at home.
You... lookin' for anything
in particular?
Names, that's all.
l'm no thief.
Yeah.
What kind of names?
Friends of Jesse Coe's.
Are you a friend of Jesse Coe's?
l'm the one that killed him.
My name is Angie--
Mrs. Coe.
You might call me
''the widow Coe.''
l don't know what to say.
l do.
Thank you.
Tell me about the men
he rode with.
You know, you look young.
But any man that could take
Jesse Coe with a knife
had to be some man.
You know where they are.
Do you know their names?
Well, l think...
one of 'em's name is... Bowdre--
Bill Bowdre.
He wanted Jesse to go
on a bank job with him
down in Louisiana.
And it's really too bad
he didn't go.
Why?
'Cause they got caught,
put in prison.
There was one other one.
l don't know his name.
That's all l can tell you.
Mm...
''Western... gang...
robs...''
''Bank... of...
New Orleans.''
''Two...''
''ap...''
Hey, Cap...
what's that word?
The word is ''apprehended.''
Well... what does it mean?
Well, it means like caught.
Say anything here about
where they were taken?
No.
Fella gets caught
robbing a bank down here,
and they throw him right
into the state prison camp.
Much obliged.
Corbin?
Yeah.
How do you want yours?
Just money.
Sand?
How do you want it?
l want all of it,
in that bag.
Max...
Shut up!
The big money's in the vault.
Get back!
Stay there.
There's only one
this time, Warden.
Two years-- he robbed a bank.
''Two years, hard labor.''
That's the only kind
we got here.
Startin' with me,
everything in this place
is mean and miserable--
the heat, the mosquitoes,
the food, the life.
There's nothing to do
all day but work,
and nothing to do
at night but sleep.
We don't have
any walls or fences.
The swamp is our wall--
miles and miles of it,
filled with dirty water,
quicksand, moccasins
and malaria.
Any questions?
No.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Just one more thing.
Don't ever make me mad.
Big Foot?
Yes, sir, Warden?
Get him out of here.
Put him in Miller's bunk.
Yes, sir, Warden.
Let's go.
Right over there.
Don't be lookin'
at this gun, boy.
They want you to go for it.
Case you're wonderin',
l'm a prisoner,
just like yourself.
l'm a trustee.
ln there.
You don't get
to keep anything, boy.
Get a blanket,
your clothes.
You get a bath
and shave once a week.
One razor for
the whole barracks.
You take your time.
This is your bunk.
Belonged to a fella
named Miller.
He died.
The only way to get
out of here, is it?
Oh, they try it
all the time, boy,
through the swamps.
Dogs are out after
two of them right now.
They tried to rob
a bank in New Orleans.
Bowdre.
Bowdre and Strayhorn.
They friends of yours?
No... l read
in the paper.
Did they make it?
Nobody's made it
since l been here, boy.
Let's get over to
the blacksmith's shop--
put these leg irons on you.
Something botherin' you, boy?
Yeah.
Let's go!
Big Foot!
Get 'em all out here
so they can watch this.
Let's go.
Big Foot!
Now you listen to this:
Strayhorn died in the swamp.
Bowdre here is going
to wish he did, too.
When he serves his time,
he's going to serve
every day of Strayhorn's.
You think about that... hard.
That ain't done here!
A man lies where he falls!
He'll drown!
The warden's watching you, boy.
Back to the mess hall!
Let's move, let's move!
You get right back
on in there, boy,
and keep the fires goin'
till mornin'.
Yeah, well... when do...
when do l sleep?
Just don't let
the fires go out.
He's really giving it to me,
ain't he?
Well, boy, you made yourself
a lot of enemies around here.
For what it's worth to you...
you made yourself
a lot of friends, too.
Thanks for what you did for me.
Ah, you would have done
the same thing for me.
l don't know.
Maybe l can do something
for you someday.
Maybe you can... someday.
Haven't l seen you
somewhere before?
Hey, you!
Back to work, no more talkin'.
l don't know, maybe.
You ever been in Santa Fe, Max?
Um... no.
Bowdre...
What happened?
What went wrong out there?
We got lost.
Maybe it was Juarez.
Juarez?
Nah, l don't think so.
Didn't you have a plan
or nothin'?
Sure, we planned to move fast
and not get caught.
What was it like out there?
ln the swamp?
Yeah.
lt was just what
the warden said it was:
miles and miles
of swamp, quicksand,
razorbacks,
poison snakes, mosquitoes,
everything that kills.
No food,
water you couldn't drink.
You just went around in circles.
Ho-ho, l've had
all the swamp l want.
Yeah... l'm goin'.
How?
l don't know yet.
But what if l find a way?
l've had it.
You count me out.
l can't--
you're the only man
here l'd risk it with.
Nice evening, ain't it?
For people with guns and whips.
Well, now take it easy, fella.
l just do my job.
Yeah, and how you love it.
l love livin', same as you.
Trouble with this place is
you can't even
pick your friends.
This is something new.
Where we going?
Didn't they tell you?
Tell me what?
We're going to clear
this ground here
for new rice paddies.
That's why everyone's so happy.
ls that good?
ls that good?
They got women there,
pal, women.
Lo and behold.
Lo and behold!
Pick out one for yourself.
Give her a great big smile.
Smile?
For what?
Don't you know?
During the planting season,
the warden rents us out
to these planters.
Course, he keeps the money
but we get the women.
Yeah?
How?
One Saturday night a month
while we're working here,
he lets them come
into the barracks.
You mean...
they let the women
come to the barracks?
Yeah.
l didn't believe
it myself at first.
And we can talk to them?
Talk to them?
Stop dreaming about women.
Think about a boat.
A boat.
All l can see, feel
or think about is woman.
Yeah?
Well, with a boat, there's
no struggling in the swamps,
there's no snakes,
there's no quicksand.
Walking or in a boat,
you still have to know
which way to go.
l thought about that,
l thought about that--
and the water
and the food and a gun.
But right now,
let's start with a boat.
Come on, let's go!
Get to work!
Work! Let's go!
Come with me.
Come on, let's go!
Hurry up!
Hurry up, don't take all day!
What do you suppose is taking
them so long to get here?
Maybe the warden
changed his mind.
He did and l'll kill him
with my bare hands!
How you doing, Max?
They are coming, ain't they?
Let's douse the lights
down there.
They'll be here now that
the candles are out.
Are you young or old?
l'm young.
So am l.
What's your name?
Max.
Mine's Pilar.
What'd you do
to wind up in here?
Oh, nothing much.
Did you kill somebody?
No.
l'm glad l didn't get one
that killed.
Nah, l just tried
to steal some money.
For a woman?
No.
You talk different.
You're not from here, are you?
No, l'm from...
l'm from the West.
Oh.
lt's dry there.
And clean.
You were born here, huh?
Ooh... born here
standing knee-deep
in water all my life,
and l'll likely die here.
Hey, l was thinking,
you're a prisoner here,
the same as me.
Yeah, but one day
they'll let you go.
Well... if you
hate it so much,
why don't you do
something about it?
Do something? What?
Get out.
Escape.
Escape? How?
ln a boat...
with me.
You interested, Pilar?
Bowdre.
l think she's going
to help us.
She's showing me a boat.
l don't see any boat.
Right over there
behind those bushes. See?
What does she want for it?
To go with us.
No. l like women
more than anything
but not when l'm running.
Oh, yeah.
l mean, you got lost,
didn't you?
Listen, she was born
and raised here.
She knows every inch
of these swamps.
We've got to have her.
Yeah... well, how you
gonna arrange everything?
And we need a gun.
l know, l know.
You boys better get
your talking done with.
You ain't gonna have
much more time for it.
They're sending
20 men out
to another camp next week.
You're on the list, Max.
Here they come!
Here they come!
Hey, here they come!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Pilar?
Listen, Pilar,
l have to talk to you.
Let's go outside.
Come on.
Listen, Pilar,
they're taking me
out of here next week.
They're taking me
to a new place.
Maybe they'll take you
to a better place,
one that's easier
to get out of.
lt's going to have
stone walls
and we ain't never going
to see each other again.
lf we're going
to get out of here,
it's got to be before that.
l don't know. Getting a boat
by myself-- that's not easy.
lt's the only way.
lf we're going to be together,
we've got to have a boat.
What happens to me then?
l'll take care of you, Pilar.
You bring me the boat,
show me the way
out of here...
l'll make you free...
and l'll start you off
in life real good.
Just treat me nice, Max.
That's all l want.
You'll be there?
Certain?
l'll try.
Trying ain't good enough--
you've got to be there.
Two hours after
the sun goes down,
you meet me down there
at the edge of the swamp.
Bring the boat down there
right by that stand of cypress.
Understand?
Let's go back inside, Max,
l'm scared.
Pilar...
if you're not there...
and they catch me,
you know what they're
going to do to me?
l'll be there.
Max?
You'll treat me nice,
won't you?
Yes.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
1 1 ... 1 3, 1 4, 1 5,
1 6, 1 7, 1 8, 1 9, 20.
You sure this is the place?
Yeah.
That dirty, filthy,
lying Cajun...
There ain't no boat.
There ain't no boat
anywheres around!
Shh-- shut up!
The minute Big Foot comes to,
they'll be after us.
We should have killed him!
Shh.
Get in.
Oh!
Max!
Something hit me.
Let's go!
Joe.
We don't get him back,
you'll serve out his time.
Yes, sir, Warden.
lf he kills one of my men
with your gun...
l'll hang you.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Warden, l'll get him.
Pilar?
Pilar, which way?
Go right.
l got to look at it.
Hold that.
Bread?
lt's good poultice.
Right!
Bottle.
Could have used swamp water
for that.
Pilar.
How do you feel?
l don't know.
l'm so sleepy.
You just got a fever,
that's all.
Max...
We're not going to get
out of here, are we?
We're going to get
out of here, Pilar.
You just tell me if
we're heading right.
l'm not sure.
Take a guess.
Best one you can.
Keep that way.
What's wrong with her?
Snakebite.
You can't go by her--
she's out of her mind.
We're lost.
We're all right.
We ain't lost.
We're heading west.
How do you know?
l can tell.
The sun.
The sun!
What do you think you are,
a lousy lndian or something?
That's right,
l'm half lousy lndian,
and my mother was an lndian.
Max.
Max Sand.
l...
l swear l didn't kill them.
l had nothing to do with it.
l was outside
minding the horses.
lt was that crazy Jesse Coe.
But... but he paid for it.
Somebody got him.
Me!
Who was with Coe
while you were outside?
Fitch-- Tom Fitch.
Two guys l just fell in with.
l didn't know
what they were like.
Where's Fitch?
California gold fields,
the last l heard.
Look... l didn't want to do it.
l couldn't help it.
They made me do it with them.
You scared, Bowdre?
Yes, l am.
Like my mother was.
Give me a chance.
Max, don't shoot!
That's all l ask,
give me a chance.
Like you blew the top
of my father's head off?
You're crazy, you're crazy!
l...
That's why you wanted to escape.
So you could kill him.
What do you plan for me?!
What do you suppose
they were shooting?
l don't know,
but they used up five bullets.
They only got one left.
Well, anyhow,
if we can't travel in this,
they can't either.
They got a boat, man.
Don't you realize that?
Pilar...
Pilar...
There's nothing
l can do to help you,
unless we get out
of this swamp
as quick as we can.
l don't know where we are.
Cool air from
dry land makes fog.
You could be out
by tomorrow morning.
l'll find a doctor,
or somebody, to help you.
You can't stop--
you'll get caught.
Leave me.
l couldn't do that,
Pilar.
l want you to.
You're a dirty, low animal.
You lied to me.
You used me to kill.
You're worse than
the man you killed.
You don't care about me--
you don't care about anybody.
You'd kill me, too,
if you had to.
No.
No?!
You have!
You're not going to die, Pilar.
l-l promise.
You'd promise anything.
l won't let you.
What do you think
you are-- God?
Go away.
Pilar...
Go away!
l don't want to die in sin,
looking at your face.
l'm sorry.
l'm so sorry.
You've been asking around
for a man by the name
of Tom Fitch?
Yeah... he's my brother.
l heard of him.
You did, huh?
A couple of months ago,
give or take a week.
He road through here,
up to no good.
Headed north.
How'd he look?
Mean as you, the kind somebody's
always looking for.
l hope you'll keep on looking.
You do, huh?
Yeah, because then you'll be
moving on out of town
as soon as
your horse gets shod.
You will, won't you?
Most likely.
Most definitely.
Three kings.
Tom Fitch.
Heard about a Joe Fitch,
worked in the mine.
300 feet down, still there.
Then there was a Carrot Fitch.
Red hair.
Now, that was back
in Fort Wayne.
Nope, Tom Fitch
doesn't ring a bell.
Any particular reason
why you're tracking him?
Yeah, he's my brother.
Got a message from home.
You'll probably run into him
one of these days.
l hope so.
l'll put the horses
in the corral.
You got some coffee?
Yeah.
Why are you staring
at that, huh?
Why? You've seen it before.
Pretty fancy.
Made from the dress
of an lndian squaw.
Named Sand?
Yeah...
Yeah!
Who would've thought...
that a wet-nosed kid
would've made
a big thing out of it?
lt's the lndian in him.
One of the best men
with a knife l ever saw
was Jesse Coe, and this kid
killed him with a knife.
Then he tracks Curly Bill Bowdre
all the way to Louisiana,
gets himself thrown in prison
just to gun him down,
and then he escaped.
You really got a bad case
of the shakes, Fitch.
The shakes!
Aw, shakes.
The kid's creepy.
He ain't human.
He doesn't kill people; he...
he executes them.
Yeah, he executes them.
Hard job, ain't it,
killing time?
l'm working.
You just can't see it.
Give me a drink.
Hell of a way to begin
a day, ain't it?
Well, l ain't
crying about it--
why should you?
lf ever you could,
it would add 20 years
to your life--
yeah, maybe somebody else's.
Morning, Buck.
Morning.
l thought l told you
to get out of town.
Well, l...
l didn't know
there was any hurry.
Mr. Fitch, this here is
a hair-trigger .45 l'm holding.
The slightest jar,
and it goes off, by itself.
Makes a hole as big
as a cannonball.
Now, turn around and put
your hands on the bar.
Put the cuffs on him.
Now, look-- our job's to keep
our ears open
and our mouths shut.
Well, now that we're here,
how are we going
to find Fitch?
He'll find us.
Yeah, he was spreading bills
all over town.
l was the first one to notice
something was wrong.
The sheriff nailed him
right up there... right here.
Hey, can we have
three whiskeys?
Yes, sir.
He wasn't a bad guy, though.
A little hard
but kind of interesting.
What was his name?
Er... Fitch--
Tom or Joe Fitch--
something like that.
l don't remember.
There you are.
Six bits.
Hey, Fitch.
Fitch.
Hey, Fitch, it's Beckwith!
Are you in there?
Fitch!
l'm here.
Well, get ready.
We're getting you out of there.
Hey, that's not Fitch!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah, hyah!
Who the hell are you?
Tom... Tom Fitch.
Try again!
Now who are you?!
Tom Fitch!
Give him some more!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
What is going on here?!
Answer me!
What's going on here?!
Are you trying to kill this man?
Let go of that rope!
Stop before l find out
what this is all about!
That is a priest!
Nobody pulls a gun on a priest!
Who says so?
Me! Cipriano says so.
By the Blessed Virgin,
l mean it!
l believe you.
Let's get out of here.
You've never been in
the church before, hmm?
No.
And... what do you think of it?
Oh, l don't know.
lt's kind of strange.
Did you ever see Him before?
Yeah, once.
He was on the end
of a little silver chain.
He's the Son of God.
He came to Earth
to teach men love
by example.
Well, he must have
missed somebody.
That looks worse than hanging.
You didn't come to supper.
l didn't work this afternoon.
You know, Padre...
this room is worse
than some jails
l've been in.
ln a way,
we're both prisoners here--
myself by choice
and you by circumstance.
Son, you will be...
Padre, will you quit
calling me ''son''?
My father's dead.
l know, Max.
But you'll be here
for some weeks.
Use them profitably.
Arguing with you?
You might read.
l brought you a book.
lt's called the Bible.
Men have been reading it
for many centuries.
What's it about?
Oh, everything important.
There's only one thing
important to me.
Finding and killing a man, huh?
Primitive, hopeless revenge.
l'll settle for that.
Why... when there
is another half of you
waiting to be discovered?
You also inherited
a refined tradition
of religion, philosophy
and conscience.
l don't understand
them words.
The difference
between right and wrong
and knowing
when not to do wrong.
lf the civilized half of you
ever wakes up, Max,
and with God's help,
you could become
a whole man someday.
With God's help,
my leg will heal
faster than you can say ''Amen,''
and l'll be out of here!
Good night.
Padre?
Come in, come in, Max.
l'm... l'm leaving now
and l... want
to bring back your Bible.
You've had it a long time.
Why don't you keep it, hmm?
Well, l... l remember
the things that matter to me.
An eye for an eye.
Which way are you heading?
l'm going north.
You look well, healthy,
rested, alive, eh?
Quite different from
when l first found you.
Sit down a moment.
Well, Padre,
l... l want to thank you
for what you did for me,
and maybe someday l'll be able
to pay you back for it.
Max, please, sit down a moment.
l would like to
show you something.
Take a look at that.
Surely a picture can't hurt you.
That beautiful couple--
that young man and woman--
came all the way
from an ancient
European civilization
to find a new and
promising life
in the American West.
On the way, a band of lndians
raided their wagons.
They killed and scalped
both of them,
after indulging in some
cursing and pleasures.
Padre...
Two... two of the children
were swung by their heels
and had their heads crushed.
The third child was saved
and grew up alone,
wanting only vengeance.
Believe me, Max,
it took more courage
to refrain from
the obvious temptation
than to give in to it.
We're different men, Padre.
No.
That was my family, Max.
l'm... the only one
who survived.
Don't do any more.
Stop while you can.
Save yourself, Max.
Don't... don't say what
you will or won't do.
Just remember:
when you ride out of here,
God goes with you.
l'll keep it in mind.
Hey! Ah!
Whoa, wait a minute!
Hold it!
Hey, that's the guy
that was using your name.
You told me he was dead.
Well, we left him for dead.
Hey, you!
Tough guy!
l could use somebody like you.
Doing what?
Do you care?
Yeah, l do.
Who are you?
Smith... Nevada Smith.
You look broke.
l am.
Suit yourself,
but if you're interested
in making a lot of money fast,
follow me.
Here, you can put
your horse in the corral.
Take mine, too,
and then come in.
Oh, no, wait!
Wait a minute!
Rudabough, Shotgun, upstairs.
Cipriano, behind the door.
The rest of you,
find your spots.
We'll soon find out
who he is.
You go in there.
Take that room.
Good.
Come on in!
Come on!
Here, sit down.
Sit down here.
Say...
Smith, tell me...
why did you use my name?
l heard of you
around.
When they picked me up,
l grabbed the first name
that came into my mind.
Under my own name,
l'm wanted.
But now, l didn't know
you were around these parts.
You're wanted?
You...
What are you wanted for?
Wanted for what?
Trying to make a living
the easy way--
same as you.
Me?
Did you ever see me before?
Not as l recall.
Any family living?
Well, now,
why do you want to know?
Wait a minute, now.
Don't get hot
under the collar, Smith.
Sometimes when you're running,
a family can help, you know.
The last time l remember,
l had a mother, a father,
two sisters, and one's married.
Now, what kind of setup
you got here, Fitch?
We'll get to that.
Tell me, have you
ever heard of a Max Sand?
Sand... Sand...
Yeah, l seen some
wanted posters on him.
Never run across him, though.
Why?
l killed his mother and father.
So?
So he's out to get me.
Part lndian.
lf there's anything
l can't stomach,
is a half-breed.
Of course, l can understand
how it happens.
There's nothing in the world
like an lndian squaw.
You agree, huh?
One of my best kinds of fun.
Me, too.
Hold it.
Here.
Why don't you use
some good tobacco?
What do you think
of that pouch, huh?
Never seen anything like it.
Where'd you get it?
Gift.
Sort of a gift.
Well, now, look, Fitch,
let's get down to it.
You said you could
use a man like me.
For what?
We're going to knock off
a gold shipment.
l'll give you
the details tomorrow.
Until then, why don't
you just kind of... relax
and get to know the boys, huh?
Okay.
Use one of the rooms upstairs.
See you around.
Max!
Hmm?
Uh, nothing... nothing,
l was just talking
to the... uh...
They take a quarter
of a million dollars
worth of gold a month
out of there.
lt's too big to hit
and too well guarded.
They don't know it,
but they're digging up
our future right now.
Once a month they
take a bullion wagon
down the road,
three miles to the railroad.
Two men on the wagon
and 1 2 guards.
We're going to have
a dozen men
of our own waiting.
Well, if you take it,
you ain't gonna
be able to go very fast
with a wagon full of gold.
We don't.
Right there we put it
in our saddlebags and head out
in 1 2 different directions,
each man on his own.
Equal split?
Naw!
All you can grab.
There won't be much time,
but we'll be able
to load up enough
to last you a few years.
A few of us are liable
to get knocked off.
Scare you?
No. l ain't planning
on being one of them.
And there'll be more
for the rest of us.
Hey, l like you.
l like him!
Now, he's got
a sense of humor!
Haw!
Black widow, jack of hearts,
queen of hearts,
deuce of hearts,
another black queen...
Give me that bottle!
Now, we're not running
any Sunday school.
But nobody...
nobody takes another drink
from now until we're finished!
l don't want any jumpy riders
or nervous triggers.
This isn't going to be
any cowhand
Saturday night spree,
a-howlin' and
shooting up the town.
We're going to move in fast,
hit hard and run!
Every man for himself!
Do we shoot to kill?
ls there any other way?!
Nah.
They move the shipment out
at 8:00.
We'll be up at 5:00.
Any questions?
Good night.
Good night.
What are you thinking about?
l'm thinking about how
l'm going to spend that gold.
Shoot straight.
l intend to.
Max!
Hey, Max!
They'll be coming down this road
and heading for that pocket.
Now, here's the road,
and here's the pocket.
Rudabough,
you take three men
and spread out on this side.
Keep your horses out of sight.
Beckwith, you take three men
and set up a roadblock up here.
And a good one--
nothing gets by.
That means the wagon.
Cipriano, you and two men
on this side
and l'll go up the road
and make sure
they don't turn back.
Alone?
Yes, alone!
Well, you don't have
to get nasty...
l'm giving the orders!
And when they come up to you,
shoot fast, aim to kill.
Get the drivers first.
Now, the one chance we have
is to do this quick
before any help can ride up.
And with the first shot,
we all close in from four sides.
Now, any questions?
Now, don't make
any mistakes, Max Sand.
Because if they don't get you,
l will.
Ben, Henry, go.
Come on.
Look at this, man!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Come on!
Max! Max! Max Sand!
That's me!
Max...
Max... l'm out of ammunition!
Then get out of there!
All right.
All right...
l'm coming.
l'm coming!
l'm coming, Max.
Here...
Now, why my hand?
Why not me?!
Huh?!
'Cause l want to see you beg!
Beg, you...!
Beg!
Beg for what?!
Beg!
Beg like my mother
and father begged!
Your mother?
Here!
Here, maybe
you'll want this, huh?
Come on...
Come on, get it over with!
Get it over with!
For God's sake,
get it over with!
You waited years for this,
so get it over with!
Come on!
Over...
Finish me...
Finish...
Finish me!
You haven't got the guts!
You're yellow!
Finish me!
You're just not worth killing.
Finish me.
Finish me!
You're yellow!
You haven't got the guts!
You're yellow!
You're yellow!
You haven't got the guts!
You haven't got the guts!
You're yellow!
You're yellow!
