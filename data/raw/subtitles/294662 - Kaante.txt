Los Angeles, 12th May, 2000.
The place where we six
rogues met for the first time.
We had thought that we
would win over the world..
..but we got screwed instead.
Aiiu.. It was his plan.
We all have to go to hell one day.
Do this job and you'll go in a..
..big car else
you'll have to go walking.
You can keep your big car.
l prefer walking.
lt's better than
going on four shoulders.
Hey stutterer,
try to understand.
Bali.. Sports a earring,
abusive in nature and pea-brained.
You're trying to
make me understand?
Do you think this is some
cooperative bank in Kolhapur?
You will walk in and point a gun at
the guard, and he will intimate the..
..cashier, who in turn, will gift-wrap
all the money and give it to you..
..saying, Happy birthday,
sir! This is America, ass!
Within two minutes,
you'll be brought back here..
..and you'll be
celebrating your birthday here.
Bali had uttered
words of wisdom for the..
..first and the last time in his life.
- Trying to make me understand!
Maior. Only Maior or his past
knew why everyone called him..
..Maior. But our
present was dearer to us.
Maior said.. - Aiiu is right. - Hell!
We'll have to come back here..
..whether we take
the right or the left.
Hey chicken! You're right.
- Yes, l'm right.
l'll send for you when
l've to burgle a poultry farm.
Chicken stealer! - Hey don't call me
chicken.. - l won't call you that.
l understood.
- Yes.
Hey! What do you say?
And this is me,
l'm always thinking.
But now, l feel why l didn't
think about it at that time.
l'll think about
it and let you know.
What'll be my share?
Andy, he had done his
masters in software development.
His consent was necessary for
the development of this plan.
As much as you can handle.
- But how much?
The question isn't : How much
liqueur is there in the bar?
The question is :
How much can you drink?
And what about the cop?
Mark, he was a bouncer in a
club. From there he bounced here..
..directly, amidst us.
He'll come in our way only when
he comes to know about our plan.
And by the time he
comes to know about it..
You would've opened a dance
bar in Mumbai along with your..
..girl. And we six would come
there to see your girl dance.
Hey Aiiu! Enough! Don't
say anything else about her.
Hey Mark! l'm scared!
See, my hands are shivering.
What if the police comes?
- They won't.
What if they do?
- Then we'll send them back.
Can't we do anything else?
Something which is less risky?
Fortune wants to
warm your bed for you..
..and you want to
sleep on the couch!
Fortune is that whore who
doesn't sleep with me. Understood?
Fortune! If any one of us
tries to make our fortune..
..then these
people won't let us.
lf someone is
killed somewhere, then..
..these people nab us.
lf there's a theft anywhere,
then our houses are searched first.
The Italians have their mafia.
The Colombians
have their cantles.
The Chinese have their triunes.
And all these are so
organized that no policeman..
..can ever dare to
knock at their doors.
And we.. we Indians,
what do we have? Nothing.
Nothing but police records.
lf even a blind man sees
something at a distance..
..of 400mts, he says,
'That must be an Indian# 
And these people nab
us and bring us here.
At a distance of 400mts, even
an elephant looks like a hammer.
We are made to wear
the turban of crime..
..and we'll be made to
wear it as long as..
..we don't have
money to buy innocence.
Maior was a good speaker.
Had he spoken on screen..
..then he would've
received an Oscar.
He spoke here and
received a bullet.
Maior made all of us think.
- Think about it.
We still have time.
- And a plan as well.
Alright! You're free for now.
lf the bell tolls in
any one of your heads..
..then come to club Niagara
tonight. l'll wait for you there.
We.. we'll wait for you there.
Had l not been there, then
you would've gone out hungry.
You got up from the bed again!
Sometimes l feel that
you like me to scold you.
ls there anything that
l don't like in you?
Yes. Why did you leave
the bed? C'mon! C'mon!
Yes, give me that.
Give me that plate.
You stayed awake all night
again, isn't it? - Yes.
l had to prepare
the project report.
But now, it's enough. l've
stayed awake many a nights.
Now l believe those
people will like my work.
We'll get money and then we
can go back to our country.
Maybe the doctors there..
- Can pe_orm that miracle..
..which none of the
Americans doctors could.
l know that l don't have enough
time to listen to your scolding.
The only gratifying thought is
that l'll be able to close my..
..eyes for the last
time in the land..
..where l had opened them first.
You shouldn't say such things.
Nothing will happen.
Please! l'm very old in this
business. l can pay back. Please!
What's this? What'll l
do with this, buffalo?
You calf of an elephant! Bull!
Will l clean myself with this?
What'll l do?
- Now what's this guy saying?
l'm saying, Milord, this
isn't enough. l want more.
l have got more customers.
More..
l don't trust your ass, man.
- Please! Please!
You bearded dog, please give me.
You know how much
this is worth, brother.
l know, l'll give you
three times.. four times more.
Please! Please, baldy!
Hey buffalo! You rhino, tell
this buffalo to remove this.
lt scares the hell
out of me. Tell him!
You don't pay that back,
man, you're dead!
Dead as a duck!
Don't worry, idiot!
Nine out of ten times, Bali's
blabbering got us into some..
..mess or the other but
we were lucky this time.
How did l fool that fatso?
- You're such an idiot.
You abuse him like anything.
Buffalo.. Goat..-
But he doesn't understand.
What if he does? - If he had
understood then we would've..
..been dead meat by now.
Hey police! Police! Run! Run!
Open that window!
Open that window!
Throw it, dog!
Game's over, guys! - l've
thrown it! l've thrown it!
Cut the shit! Where's
the truck? - What truck?
ls this about a truck? - Is
there something else you want to..
..talk to me about?
- No! No! - Shut the hell up!
Where's my truck? - Your truck partner
is there, there and there.
Let's get these guys out.
Lose your crazy heart to me..
Lose your crazy heart to me..
When has the heart
followed our orders?
There's always
chaos in this heart..
He'll steal my gaze,
he'll lock me in his heart..
..will this ever happen?
No.. no..
Lose your crazy heart to me..
Lose your crazy heart to me..
These rosy cheeks of mine
are trying to trap you..
The trap of
these golden hair..
..the eyes that
are watching you.
How'll you escape and save
yourself? This won't happen..
..No.. no..
Lose your crazy heart to me..
Lose your crazy heart to me..
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
You created trouble again!
You're fired!
Because l take my iob
very seriously, is it?
Not seriously, because you
take your job very personally.
That guinea
bastard was touching her.
Stop! Stop!
l need this bastard as
well as many such bastards.
Otherwise will l drink all
the whisky in this club myself?
l need customers! Stop! Stop!
Do you know the
job of a bouncer?
He's supposed to keep the
customers away from the girls.
Not break their bones. Do you
understand that? You're fired!
Shut up, Cyrus! - You're fired!
Throw him out! - Fuck you, Cyrus!
lt's alright! It's ok! It's
alright! This is the best club.
C'mon, guys! Have a great time!
Three hours ago, a truck full
of lockup disappeared from..
..highway thirteen. We have a
feeling you could tell us about it.
What are you talking about?
l've been working here for
the past six hours, damn it.
Ask him. - Why are you lying?
He's lying. He wasn't here.
He's lying. He wasn't here.
Goodbye! Goodbye!
Excuse me! l'm
here to see Mr. Adler.
l'm afraid he
hasn't come in yet.
l'm here to see Mr. Rubric.
- Mr. Rubric, you've a visitor.
Down the hall.
Ma'am! - Sir, l'm sorry Mr.
Adler is in a meeting.
Perhaps you would like
to try again next week.
O Mr. Adler! Sir, l
won't take much of your time.
l won't beat around the bush.
We can't do business with you.
Your background is so..
Look, Mr. Adler,
l'll explain to you.
The board won't listen to me.
l really cannot convince them.
l'm very sorry. - Sir!
Excuse me! Mr. Adler! Sir!
Mr. Adler, see. l've
given up all those things.
l've started life anew. In
the past ten months of my new..
..life l've developed
this new business plan.
l can bet on anything that
your board won't ignore this..
..business plan. According
to this plan, listen to me..
..70/o of the market, packaged
Indian food, will be in your..
..pocket in the first quarter.
l have the capability to work hard.
l've courage.. the nerve.. l
just need your support and faith.
Ok, your idea is interesting.
Why don't you meet me..
..at my office
tomorrow morning at 9am.
Ok. l'll..
- Time to go, Major. Let's go.
ls anything wrong, officer?
- When was it ever right?
Let's go, Maior.
- But..
Hey! Mcguiry wants to see you.
- Why me?
You can ask him yourself
at the station. Let's go.
Hey you, Blondie. You're next.
As far as me and
Bali were concerned..
..all our stories
had three facets to it.
One was mine, the other his
and the third was the truth!
Hey guys! Did Bali
tell you how we came here?
For the sake of Biryani.
He came home early morning..
..saying that his uncle was
making Biryani at his place.
Forget home-made Biryani, his
uncle fed us burgers instead.
That too from MacDonald's.
As soon as we came out, we met
Mcguiry and we are here now.
Are you getting bored?
After that..
You, sir, let it be.
Are you going to tell
me where the truck is?
What truck are you talking
about, man? - The truck you stole.
Stole!? Do l look
like a thief to you?
Yes, you do. - Tell him! l
had been there to meet Rosy.
She stays on the twelfth floor.
Rosy! Tell him.
You tell him.
l went to meet Rosy.
Big boobs Rosy.
My girlfriend. Big boobs Rosy.
What was l going to do taking
the truck to the twelfth floor?
How do l take the truck to
the twelfth floor? You tell me.
Maior! Tell me about the truck?
What the hell are you guys
talking about? What did l do?
l was iust doing
my work quietly.
That's what, Maior. You are
always doing your job quietly.
But we aren't going
to sit here quietly.
Maior, this time we're going to
make sure that you've a very..
..long appointment with the law.
Yeah, right.
- You bet.
Maior, why do l feel that
you've a secret to share?
Would you like to listen?
- Sure. Why not?
By calling me here, you people
have committed a grave mistake.
Really?
- A very grave mistake.
Now apologize for your
mistake and tell me..
When do l get to go?
When we find the truck.
- And when will you find it?
When you tell us about it.
You are asking the wrong person.
Really? Then
who's the right guy?
When love
transcends all limits..
When life becomes restless..
Don't love so much that
Iust goes into your mind..
The ocean of love!
The ocean of love!
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.
Without seeing my beloved..
l'm not able to
understand anything..
My eyes will tell
you all about love.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.
Without seeing my beloved..
l'm not able to
understand anything..
No one is unfaithful..
is bad at heart..
By luck, crazy lovers
don't always have bad times.
The heart is torn to shreds
when the dagger of time is pierced.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.
You also fall in love
with the unfaithful.
You also fall in love
with the unfaithful.
Whoever maybe your companion,
but you do have one.
The ocean of love.
l've to love you..
l've to wait for you.
l've to love you..
l've to wait for you.
Living for me, is
to die in your love.
Till when will you be on the
run, making me wait for you?
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.
Without seeing my beloved..
l'm not able to
understand anything..
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
The ocean of love
is within my heart.
Where were you at 6am.?
Hey asshole, l
asked you a question!
No English. Tell him
that l don't know English.
He doesn't know
the language, sir.
Then you tell him what
l ask him. - Oh l will.
Where were you at 6am?
- Where were you at 6am?
l was with his wife.
- What is he saying?
He said he was in a bar, sir.
Well, what was he doing?
- What were you doing?
l was banging.
- He was drinking, sir.
With whom? - With whom?
- His wife. - Friends.
Where's the truck?
- Where's the truck?
l forgot it outside his house.
Sir, obviously this man doesn't
know anything about any truck.
Does he want us to get nasty? -
Hey hero, don't take uncle Sam..
..to be your uncle. Answer
fast. He's getting angry.
Tell him to get angry at his wife,
she also put in the same effort.
Look sir, this man obviously
doesn't know about anything.
Well then who does? - Then
who knows? - His wife knows.
Your wife. - What? - No. My
mistake. He said, 'his man'.
His man. - How does he know?
- And how does he know?
Because he was banging her too.
Give me a moment, will you, sir?
Look, foreigner! Don't act
like the mafia, wearing a trench coat.
This is regarding my iob.
Answer the questions.
What the hell are you talking about?
- He's just wasting our time.
He's bull-shitting us.
He's playing with us.
They kept asking all night
and Ajju kept answering..
..that he was with
that cop's wife.
After sometime, even that
officer started believing that..
..Aiiu truly was
with Mcguiry's wife.
Did you listen? Hey asshole!
Uncle Sam has laid
his eyes on you.
Tell him not to look at me too
much. It'll do me bad. Asshole!
Truck.
- Lawyer.
What lawyer?
- What truck?
Where's the truck?
- Where's my lawyer?
Do these people think
of us as talcum powder?
Even if they itch a little,
they pick us up.
Not talcum powder, but condoms.
They use us all night..
..and flush us down the
toilet in the morning.
Hey Aiiu! Shall we talk
business? - Yes, boss.
Anyway, they pick us
up every third day.
lt isn't good
for my resputation.
Which station?
- Resputation. - What?
Resputation means status. You
won't understand its English.
Ok. Status, that too yours?
Hey donkey, what do..
..you do when
you're outside the jail?
The same thing that you
do with Mcguiry's wife.
This Mcguiry's
wife is quite popular.
How many of you have
an affair with her?
Mark? Andy?
- No. My standard is a bit high.
Good. Let's get
down to business.
Maior, l had heard that
you had given up everything.
Boss, Maior had promised his
wife that he's given up everything.
Just like our hero. Hey! Even
you've promised your girl that..
..you've given up everything,
isn't it?
What? What have you
promised your girl?
That l'll kill you.
- Then kill him first.
l can't give up my business
for a girl. Stupidity! Stupidity!
Business!? Have you seen
his girl? - Is she beautiful?
Beautiful? She's the
queen of Club India.
You're talking of business? l
can leave this world for her sake.
l'll help you leave this world.
- Leave him.
Hey guys! - Maior!
Major, just ignore them.
They're iust whiling away their
time. You were saying something.
Mcguiry is whiling
away his time with us.
But you people
won't understand that.
You keep wasting your
time over unnecessary talks.
You won't think why the
police is always arresting us.
The police commits the
crime of arresting us.
Hence, the police will
pay the price for doing so.
How? - By looting their banks.
- The service American bank?
Every cop here has
an account there.
That's why no one has dared
to loot that bank till date.
Because the one who loots
this bank will be taken on a..
..procession to the
graveyard by the entire police dept.
Then why do you think, smarty,
that the same won't happen to you?
Because brother Bali, the security
in that bank is so weak that..
..even your mother will
be able to loot that bank.
Till now, they received
their salaries from that bank..
..now we'll
receive ours from there.
We've received it.
We all have to go to hell one day.
Do this job and you'll go in a..
..big car else
you'll have to go walking.
You can keep your big car.
l prefer walking.
lt's better than
going on four shoulders.
Hey stutterer,
try to understand.
You're trying to
make me understand?
Do you think this is some
cooperative bank in Kolhapur?
You will walk in and point a gun at
the guard, and he will intimate the..
..cashier, who in turn, will gift-wrap
all the money and give it to you..
..saying, Happy birthday,
sir! This is America, ass!
Within two minutes,
you'll be brought back here..
..and you'll be
celebrating your birthday here.
Aiiu is right. - Hell!
We'll have to come back here..
..whether we take
the right or the left.
Hey chicken! You're right.
- Yes, l'm right.
l'll send for you when
l've to burgle a poultry farm.
Chicken stealer! - Hey don't call me
chicken.. - l won't call you that.
l understood.
- Yes.
We've to make them talk,
sir. What do we do with them?
Let them go. l'll
get those damn Indians.
Alright! You're free for now.
We all started
going our own ways..
..when Satan called out
to us for the last time.
lf the bell tolls in
any one of your heads..
..then come to club Niagara
tonight. l'll wait for you there.
We.. we'll wait for you there.
Mark, why are you
always fighting?
l can't stay calm if
anyone touches you.
This can't go on, it's
got to stop. - l know!
Ok. Listen. We'll meet Cyrus,
we'll talk and we'll work it out.
But you've to promise me
that you won't lose your temper.
l won't. Ok? Come.
You've come back again?
Can't you
understand simple words?
Listen, man. l haven't
come here to fight with you.
l iust want my iob back. l
promise you, there won't be..
..anymore problems
here because of me.
There'll be problems only
when you don't go from here.
Ok. C'mon!
- Go, Lisa. Go!
lf one girl goes, a hundred
will come. This is America, baby!
Go with this good-for-nothing.
Go! Go! Go!
C'mon, Lisa. C'mon!
- Where, Mark?
Lisa!
- No! Look, Mark. l love you.
But even l've very few options.
l don't like doing all this.
But what do l do?
You know this is L.A.
And it's very difficult for a
girl to stay alone in this city.
Very difficult! - But, Lisa,
you're not alone. l'm with you.
Where are you, Mark? You
spend half of your time in jail.
l want to come with you.
But when you
have your own house.
l'll surely have
my own house, Lisa.
But there won't be any
place for you in that house.
But you know that your
mom doesn't like dogs.
What shit!
How many times have l told
you not to use such language?
l'm sorry, dad but
this is not fair.
C'mon, let's go home.
Could we spend some
more time, dad? Please?
Listen. You know that
when l take you home late..
..your mom gets angry. She'll
scowl at you. Fights with me.
Yeah. - And what when
she comes home late?
She works.
- No! She goes out with uncle.
Which uncle?
- The uncle who comes home.
The one who
bought me these shoes.
Since when is he coming home?
- Since a long time.
C'mon. Let's go home.
What time is it? If you
can't bring him home in time..
..then why do you take him out?
- Renu!
Don't 'Renu' me!
It's enough, Andy.
lf you're going to act so
irresponsibly then l feel..
..you should stop meeting him.
Renu, l'm his father.
- Oh really? Then bear the..
..expenses of his education,
his dresses.
You call yourself his father?
Then where were you when..
..he was ill and l had to
call the doctor at midnight?
And then where were you
when he was beaten up by..
..his schoolmates and
had come home crying?
You were in iail, Andy.
You were in iail
and we got punished.
lt wasn't my fault.
It was a mistake.
Yes. It's never
your fault, Andy.
When was it your fault?
It's my entire fault.
lt's my fault that l
married a man like you.
You're a loser, Andy.
- Shut up!
Don't shout! This is my house.
And l know what
happens in this house.
Aren't you ashamed! You
come to meet your son so..
..that you can ask him
about my personal life?
Well, how sick can you get?
- Renu, it's nothing like that.
l haven't asked him
anything about you.
l don't care, Andy.
And one more thing..
..don't try to rule over
me because only a husband..
..has the right to do so, and you
Iost that right a long time ago.
Renu! Why don't we start
living together again?
l'll work things out.
Why? What'll you do?
Will you rob a bank?
l don't
understand all your plans.
What l understand is this!
Beauty! Look!
Look! - You can't
understand anything, man.
Look, ripe mangoes.
Hello beautiful! How are you?
Hey he's a guy!
- Oh a guy! Not my kind.
What a fool!
- Look, here's a girl.
Until l lighten up,
my brain doesn't work.
And moreover, my hands have
been aching for the past 10 days.
What is your name?
- Sugar! - Sugar!
C'mon, pal! You are
possessed just about one thing.
l agree but my father had told
me not to be possessed at anytime.
1
When l was small
my father told..
You fool! When your dad
makes your strip and kicks..
..yOU On yOUr aSS,
then you'll understand.
Which dad? The one in the
morning, the one in the..
..afternoon, the one in the
evening or the one at night?
Even my mom doesn't know
who my actual father is.
Not even my mother, you know..
You know which dad
l'm talking about.
The one whose powder you
threw in the L.A. atmosphere.
l'll think of some
plan to pay him back.
Hey pal! We should find
some solution to this problem.
Then what do you think? Does
those people's idea to loot..
..a bank, provide a solution?
l'll think of something.
You don't worry.
You'll think? - Look, if you
feel that what those four fools..
..think is right, then
you're a bigger fool than them.
Man, their money..
- Don't eat my brains, man!
lf you can arrange
for the money somehow..
..then do it. Do
it however you want.
Let me think about
my little brother.
Listening to all these
boring talks of yours..
..l feel that it must have
gone slept off standing. - Ok! Ok!
Think, what if
they loot the bank?
Then it's their good fortune.
- Not their good fortune, but ours.
How's that? - Look, if the plan
fails, then we all will escape.
And if it succeeds, then
the money will be with us..
..and four bullets
in their bellies.
Keep talking! Keep talking!
Look, there's a
Iot of gain in this.
There's iust a
distance of four bullets..
..between us and
millions of dollars
After this, the money that was
supposed to be split into six..
..will be split into two.
One yours, and the other mine.
Mine will be split
among these people.
C'mon, man! - C'mon, Bali! -
No! No! l'll be back after..
..killing four others. - What?
- No, you won't understand.
l'm coming. - Coming? - l'm
coming. Don't worry. Let's go!
Did they like your
job very much? - Yes.
This time l've
found the right people.
Now there's
nothing more to fear.
l have full faith in you. You
can never do anything wrong.
But what if it's too late?
- l won't let it be late.
lt's my promise.
So you all are ready.
- Yes, alright.
The plan is..
- Just a minute, Major.
What's this? - l knew that
this rascal had stolen the truck..
..and we all got screwed.
That's why l'm splitting
the money among all of us.
All of you keep the
money on the table.
Why? - Because in
order to loot a bank..
..we need guns, cars,
cameras explosives..
..and for all
that we need money.
What if l hadn't
been a gentleman, Major?
Then we would've
stolen something else.
We can steal
something else even now.
Let's keep the money
with us for the time being.
No, Bali. Maior is right.
When there's a feast,
why should we beg?
Andy!
This money is enough for me.
C'mon, it's good. The money
that was to be split into six..
..will now be split into five.
- No! Even now, the money..
..will be split into six.
- Why?
Will you give me an
extra share, Major?
Not at all. Every gadgetry
in the bank is computerized.
The cameras, vaults, everything.
lt has a security code. And
we need a software engineer..
..to break that code.
Why do we need an engineer,
Major? This Tarzan is with us.
He'll break the code.
We've to break the
bank's vault, Bali.
Not the bank manager's neck.
Why are you
unnecessarily trying..
..to make him understand, Maior?
He doesn't know the difference
between software and underwear.
What do we do now, Maior?
- We've got to get Andy.
This is not enough. - l love
my son, isn't that enough?
No.
- Meaning?
Look, Andy. This money is
enough to fight the case.
But not enough to win it. To
win the case, the judge will..
..ask whether your son has
a bright future with you.
Whether your son will get new
clothes, toys to play with..
..will he see a
college from inside.
The answer to all these
questions is money, Andy.
A lot of money. l'm sorry, Andy.
Lifting up their collars..
..puffing on a cigarette.
Lifting up their collars..
..puffing on a cigarette.
What's there to worry about?
Whatever has to
happen will happen.
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Gentlemen, welcome to
the Service American Bank.
All of us will enter
the bank one by one.
So that all of us get
familiarized with the bank.
They want dollars, they want
pounds, they want to hear..
..the sound of gold coins.
This guy is a fool, he
doesn't know anything.
This guy is a fool, he
doesn't know anything.
He iust wants money.
What's there to worry about?
Whatever has to
happen will happen.
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
lf the police comes then
it'll come from here, or here.
Meaning, here, here and here.
l want all of you to check..
..every nook and
corner of every street.
Do not leave even a corner,
not even a single inch.
Otherwise we won't know from
which way death will come for us.
They left behind all
their friends and relatives.
They broke all
the laws of society.
For the sake of
unknown paths..
..they turned
their backs to life.
What's there to worry about?
Whatever has to
happen will happen.
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
But we've to keep the people
in the bank under control.
We've to keep
them under control.
Neither do l want
any bloodshed there..
..nor any innocent deaths.
Why do these deaths
always have to be innocent?
Hey! Why aren't there any
brains inside your skull?
There aren't
answers to all questions.
Then why are there questions?
Maior, make him understand.
Why should Maior make me
understand? - Shall l continue?
l swear on Allah! No
one throughout America..
..can give you
more stuff than me.
Mark, shall we take everything?
- Why?
Are you going to fight a war?
You can even fight a
war with all these, dear.
l swear on Allah! Half
of Kashmir resounds with..
..the sound of my bombs.
Hasn't anyone
caught you till date?
How will anyone catch me?
l'm a very smart man.
l've very highly
placed contacts.
So you've very highly
placed contacts eh? - Yes, why?
You think that
you're very smart eh?
l don't think so,
l'm very smart.
Then rat, hasn't anyone told
you not to talk of destroying..
..lndia when amidst Indians?
Dear one! Whatever
an Indian might be..
..he never likes two things.
One is, losing in cricket..
..and secondly,
attacking our country.
They're so determined
that the earth is..
..above them and
the sky below them.
The burden of the earth
fell on the earth and died.
What's there to worry about?
Whatever has to
happen will happen.
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!
Andy and Mark had always done
bad things living in their country..
..maybe for that moment,
the burden on..
..their souls
had lessened a bit.
We'll reach there in
three different cars.
Mark and Aiiu will
be in the first car.
And Mac and Bali
will be in the second.
And l and Andy
will be in the third.
By the time Andy and l reach, Aiiu
and Mark would've done their job.
First car, second car, third car..
is someone sponsoring the cars?
Yes. You're
responsible for that. Here, take.
Hey donkey! This money hasn't
been loaned from your chicks.
Bali, use this money like your
brains.. - No way! - ..with care.
Hey! l'm tired of eating this. Why
don't you order rice and pulses?
Hey! Shut up!
Maior, will we scare the
guards by showing our fingers?
No. with guns. You,
Mark and Andy will..
..collect the guns,
today evening.
Hey! Shoot with one eye shut. -
Bali's bullets find their targets..
..by themselves, brother.
lf you keep aiming like this then
you'll become a target one day.
lt's easy to shoot words,
Major. Do you know to shoot? Do you?
lt's loaded.
After that, no one dared
to speak against Major.
Eh Bali! Come here.
- What?
Tell me one thing, if l
keep this bomb on your head..
..then what will rip open
first? This bomb or your head?
The bomb will rip open first. No.
Actually the head can also rip open.
No, pal. This is a really
confusing question. You tell me.
Your ass will rip open first.
Aiiu! - What's this? - Bomb.
l activated it. - What?
Keep sitting. Keep sitting.
Keep sitting?
Hey! Will this erupt?
You fool! It's a bomb and it's
beeping, so it's bound to erupt.
Why, man? - You're
scared shit! You're scared!
Hey Mark! Are you standing
there waiting for this bomb..
..to erupt!?
Deactivate it! Deactivate it!
lt's can't be deactivated.
- What do you mean?
Meaning? You forgot
Hindi along with English?
ls this bomb enough to
kill this scoundrel..
..or do l keep another?
- No! It's not needed.
He'll die such a death that
he won't take birth again.
Then here, smoke
your last cigarette?
Tell me something, Mark.
- Yes. - When the bomb erupts..
Yes.
- Will his hands tear off from..
..the elbow or
from the shoulder?
He'll die!
- He'll die!? - Yes.
lf l die, then l'll take
everyone else along with me.
Then who'll fulfill
your rites? My father?
Do you have any one of your own?
You beggar! Why
fear when l'm here?
l fear because the bomb is here.
Hey Mark! From today, l'll
address your girl as my sister.
You'll do so, right?
- Yes. - You'll do so? - Yes.
Then throw it. Throw
it else it'll burst.
Why?
- Throw it else it'll burst.
Hey throw it! It'll burst! -
Hey Bali! Throw it! - Hey! Hey!
Hey Andy! Take it!
Look what happened there!
Look what happened there!
You call this a bomb?
There's gas coming out of it.
Why? Are you
regretting about being alive?
Moreover, it made a chicken out
of you. Didn't it? - Yes, it did.
So, this is our plan incase
the police comes there tomorrow.
Why are you talking about
the police all the time?
You're scaring me.
Why don't you say..
..at least once that
the police won't come?
lf.. Bali, if.. - This
'lf' is a very dangerous word.
lf this happens,
then this will happen.
lf this doesn't happen,
then that won't happen.
lf my aunt grows
moustaches then l'll call her uncle.
This is very bad.
Hey Bali! Hey Bali!
Why do you get tensed?
What are you
talking about tension?
lt scares the shit out of me.
You're talking of tension.
Hey! Who knows about tomorrow?
Here, take. Have a cigarette.
C'mon! What'll l do about this?
Aiiu's bomb helped us forget
everything for a few moments..
..and gave us an
opportunity to laugh.
How could we know
that death was..
..secretly
Iaughing at us as well.
We all will go in 2l2
formation. Mac and Bali first..
..and then me and Andy. Aiiu
and Mark will be present..
..there already. Once
we're in, we're all strangers.
No one will talk to the other.
As soon as we go in, me and
Andy will go to the manager's..
..cabin. l'll handle the
manager and Andy, you'll manage the..
..security cameras. We'll have
only five minutes for you. Ok?
All four of you will be in
your positions. Near the alarms.
As soon as l come out wearing
a mask you all will wear yours.
And move the security guards
away from the alarm first.
lf anyone presses the
alarm before deactivating it..
..then we sink along
with our plan. Get it?
We had everything with us.
Plan, money and courage.
lf we didn't have anything,
then it was just mutual trust.
Because we all had taken birth
Iearning one thing from our..
..mother's womb : Never trust
anyone ! Not even your mother !
Which iunkyard have
you brought us to, Major?
Ok everybody, cell phones.
- Why?
Neither will anyone
use their phones now..
..nor will anyone
move out of this place.
And we'll loot
the bank tomorrow.
But the plan to loot the bank
is for the day after tomorrow.
We'll loot it tomorrow.
Any problems?
Very smart, Maior. l understood.
lf we loot the bank tomorrow
instead of the day after..
..then none of us will be
able to make our own plans.
l'm with you.
Me, too.
l don't keep one.
Ok, one final time.
We'll discuss the plan again.
How many times do we
discuss the plan, Major?
lf we discuss it once again,
then we'll forget everything.
Then what'll we do
till tomorrow morning?
What'll we do? We'll
drink and make merry!
l'll arrange for a
couple of babes.
Hey! Keep it.
- No? - No.
Hey listen! The plan. The
plan is a watch. Swiss watch.
The parts of the watch,
that's us. If we're pe_ect..
..then the watch
is also pe_ect.
Tick- tock! Tick-tock!
Otherwise, it'll turn into..
..a bomb and we'll go..
boom.. understood?
Yes, so what was l saying?
The plan. Once more, the plan.
l'm sick, l'm tired.
Whatever you've said..
..has stuck to my brains,
brother.
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
There's a bank, within
the bank, there's a safe..
..in the safe, there's booty
and on the booty are our eyes.
Bank.. boom.. safe.. boom..
booty.. boom..
We're rich now, we
don't have any worries.
You'll forget getting panicky,
tomorrow, we'll have so much money.
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Planning has
become too boring.
Open the bottle and pour
the liqueur. Understood?
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Hey brother! Big daddy,

Don't split my brains!
Hey brother, we're
tired so we're sitting..
Aren't you tired of sitting?
C'mon! C'mon! Talk!
Money! Money! Money
did something amazing..
..it trapped my
heart in a net.
What's love.. romance..
- boom.. - booty.. - boom..
..it threw me
empty-handed out of life.
Leave love's collar, brother.
Let's count dollars, brother.
Forget the game of love..
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Look, our poet woke up.
l left everything..
l left everything..
l broke the heart
that gave me love.
l left my own.. my dreams..
l broke my relation with ioy.
l left everything..
This world is crafty..
anything can happen here.
This world is crafty..
anything can happen here.
Give up receiving..

Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

Don't split my brains!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!
Excuse me, gentlemen. Is
this some kind of a joke?
No. Actually it's a robbery.
Forget it.
lf we're successful today, then
at the most, you'll lose your..
..iob. if we're unsuccessful,
then..
..at the least,
you'll lose your life.
So you do your work quietly
and let us do ours. Got it?
l'll translate real fast.
lf we pull this one off..
if we pull this one off..
..at worst, you lose your iob.
lf we don't, at the best,
you'll be shot.
So why don't you
shut your mouth..
..and continue doing your
work and allow us to do ours.
Excuse me.
Everybody down!
Down!
Down!
Down! Down!
Down!
What babe?
What are you doing tonight?
We can enioy all night,
l'll have enough
..money after looting this bank.
Hey! Put up your hands!
Put up your hands!
Out!
C'mon!
Steady! Easy!
Kill me. - This bullet
will kill you before that.
Now don't shout anymore. Ok?
Half of your life
will perish shouting!
lf you've the strength to shout then
have the strength to bear the pain.
lt'll burn a little. Ok?
lf you had listened to me earlier..
..then you wouldn't
have had to scream now.
l won't scream!
l won't scream!
Just relax.
Maior!
Maior, l'm feeling very scared.
lt's ok, you should feel scared.
You've been
brave all day, today.
lt doesn't matter if
you feel afraid now.
l'll take you to the hospital
as soon as these people show up.
Promise me. Promise me, Maior.
- Yes. l promise.
What if l die
before they show up?
We'll bury you somewhere.
Hey! Nothing will
happen to you, understood?
We've been trapped.
Hey! He's dead!
l'm still alive.
Don't worry. You'll surely die.
Shut up! Just shut up!
Nothing will
happen to you. Nothing!
ls it paining a lot?
No. It's tickling
me and l'm laughing.
lt'll hurt you more
if you laugh, jackass!
Lie there quietly, you'll live.
Where are the rest?
- l don't know.
How did you come here?
- By car.
What car? - The lady
didn't tell me her name.
Which lady? - Someone over there,
but she isn't there any longer.
One among us is a traitor.
- What?
One of us is an
informer for the police.
You think one of us
is a police informer?
Don't you think so, oldie?
Hey! Mind your tongue.
Else you won't leave this place.
l'm not bothered!
Even then l'll speak.
Someone has vomited
everything to the police.
And if you don't feel so then..
..you've lost your
mind and he, his life.
Shut up! Shut up!
l won't shut up!
You had said that there
won't be much security there.
Yes, l had said that there
wasn't much security there.
Because there shouldn't
have been much security there.
Then how did my in-laws reach that
place with my wedding procession?
lt's possible that someone
might have tipped off the police..
..so that they could escape
with the money at the last moment.
Yes, that's possible.
Where's the bag?
- Huh?
Bag.. where's your bag?
That.. it's there somewhere.
- Where?
Somewhere there..
- Where there?
Why should l tell you?
Let everyone
come then l'll tell.
Where's the bag!
Have you said anything?
- No.
How did you escape from there?
- How did you?
l asked you first.
l hit three out-laws,
one in-law..
..and escaped with his car.
l hope you don't
feel that all this..
..is my doing?
- It's possible.
lt's possible in
your case as well.
lt's possible. - It's possible.
Why isn't it possible?
He has died.
- He's unconscious.
No, he isn't moving. He's dead.
He's unconscious.
Let's go there and talk.
Why did l feel that he has died?
Tell me something, Maior.
lf the police can come there,
then it can come here as well.
So? - So what? Let
the both of us leave.
And what about him?
What about him?
- He's injured.
We're not going to leave him
like that. We'll kill him.
What are you looking at, Maior?
He's of no use. He's a
burden on the earth.
He's your friend.
There aren't any friends
in business, only partners.
He was the one
who taught me that.
From the first day, till today.
Every story is about his share.
Hey! Stop! Hurry up!
Let's leave!
Who are you?
- l'm a cop.
And who's that?
- Thief.
What's in your hand?
How much do you have?
Ten. - Five each. -
Seven mine and three yours.
Five each. - Ok, truce. Six
mine and four yours. C'mon, man!
No. Five each.
- Ok done.
Let's leave! Run!
He's a rogue! A rogue!
Had l been in his place today, then
he would've said the same thing.
You both would've
killed me and left.
He got shot, his fate.
We weren't, our luck.
Shut up! Just shut up!
Anyway, that dog is
going to die in an hour.
Why don't we kill him and
escape from here? - Shut up!
Shut up!
Ok. If you don't want to come..
..then don't. l'm leaving.
Hey Bali! Bali!
You've gotten into my nerves!
Since when have l been
tolerating your nonsense!
You're sick! You're sick!
l won't be able to tolerate
your nonsense any longer..
..do you understand that?
Understand?
Now before l shoot your
brains off your skull..
..tell me where's the bag.
Where's the bag?
Great, Maior!
Blow his brains off!
Even l want to see whether he's
got grass stuffed inside or hay.
You're alive. l
thought you were dead.
Were you thinking so..
or wanting so, Major?
What do you mean?
- Nothing. Nothing.
lt would've been good
had anyone shot you.
You shoot me, that's
why the police spared me.
For you.
Where are Andy and Mark?
l don't know.
You're acting as if
nothing has happened.
What has happened? - He thinks
there's an informer amidst us.
What do you think, Maior?
- It's possible.
l don't think so. l know.
What else do you know?
What do you mean by that?
There's someone amidst
us who's an informer.
You're the one.
- What?
You're the informer.
- Hey! Don't talk nonsense.
l'm not talking nonsense. You
informed the police, isn't it?
l've evidence to prove it.
- Hey smarty!
Don't act smart or else..
- Or else what?
l'll shoot you, mad guy!
Yes, l'm slowly going mad.
Shoot me!
- Look Ajju, l'll shoot you.
Shoot me!
- l'll shoot you!
Hey Aiiu, l'll shoot you.
Hey Bali, your gun is
as empty as your head.
Where are the bullets?
- It was there..
l swear it was there.
lt was there.. where's it?
lt's here.
This is loaded.
What are you doing?
- l've found out everything.
You've been seen with
a policeman many times.
Who's seen me?
- A man. He's coming.
Your man is talking nonsense.
Since when are you
fooling us? Speak up!
How do l fool you?
You're already one.
You planned all this
with a policeman, isn't it?
You can think what you want.
But move this pistol.
Ok.
Listen.. Move it! You'll
fire a shot by mistake. Hey!
Move it! Hey!
Move it! Move it!
Chicken!
He's such a chicken!
What you said there..
what's it about?
l was iust kidding, Maior.
There should be
some fun, isn't it?
That guy has been shot,
and he's lying there.
There's no sign of Andy and Mark.
The police can come in anytime.
And you feel like having fun?
Ok, Maior. l'm sorry.
l was just..
l was iust what?
l was just what?
All of you are crazy! Don't
know what l've gotten myself into!
Hey Maior..
- Hey! Move your hand!
Now don't get so annoyed..
- What don't get annoyed?
You're getting too angry,
Major. l was just kidding.
Even l was kidding.
Hey don't touch me!
lf you're done with your love
scene, then shall l say something?
Yes. Tell me. What do
you want to blabber about?
Yes. l'll blabber. From now,
l'm going to blabber.
We're standing like this over
here. What if the police come?
Let them come. We'll see.
You see them. See
them through binoculars.
l'm going.
- Where are you going?
Somewhere where l can stay alive.
At least one of us has to
stay alive to attend your burial.
Asking where, huh! Bye!
Hey! What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?
You're not going anywhere.
Tell me something, who are
you to stop me everyday?
Your father. Because right now,
he's the one who has a loaded gun.
So? So?
So you're such a chicken..
such a chicken..
..that a few bullets fired here and
there made you wet your pants eh?
Hey chicken! Hey chicken,
speak up!
Yes, l'm a chicken!
l'm a chicken!
You're a beggar!
A beggar! You don't
have anyone of your own.
l've a twenty year old sister. A
twenty year old sister, understood?
Shall l marry her?
Will you marry her? Do
you have the guts to do so?
She's mentally
retarded since birth.
l'll be your slave all
life if you marry her.
Will you marry her?
l've taken care of her..
..since childhood.
Will you take care of her?
l'm a chicken! So what?
What's wrong in that?
You're scared to
death now, aren't you?
Aren't you scared now?
You were making a big plan!
We'll earn a lot of money!
Earn a lot of money, eh?
Because of you we all are in a mess
now. Because of you, understood?
He's right.
- Major, you too?
Hadn't you shot that fellow then we
wouldn't have gotten into trouble.
l can't understand you people. -
Why? Didn't you shoot that man?
He was trying to
press the alarm, Major.
All the alarms were deactivated.
All the alarms were deactivated.
l had forgotten that!
l explained to him a
thousand times not to move.
l even pressed a gun to his temple.
Even then he moved,
so l shot him.
lt was a matter of my honor.
What else could l've done?
Then you did the right thing.
Even l don't compromise
when it comes to my honor.
Hey! What are you saying? Even
you killed four people there.
What else could l have done?
l had to protect myself.
Even you should've practiced
your firing on 2-3 people.
lt was such a fine opportunity,
so many constables together.
Do you think that
l'm a donkey like you?
Because of your
foolishness l'm trapped here today.
He.. he.. he got
shot instead of me.
That bullet was meant for me, l was
saved because he came in between.
lf not, then l
would've died today. Fools!
lf l had known that
you all are such big..
Then l wouldn't have taken up this iob
l would never have taken up this job.
Hey Maior!
- What is it?
Are you going to bark all day or
are you going to bite as well?
Hey! What did you say?
What did you say?
Are you going to bark all day or
are you going to bite as well?
You want me to bite you eh?
Leave him, Maior.
l'll pump so many bullets
into you that the next time..
..you press the trigger, the bullet
will come from some place else.
Why do you mess with this pimp?
Hey you whore! Whom
are you calling a pimp?
Why? Hasn't anyone called
you by your real name before?
Yes. l'm a pimp. Your
girl's pimp. What'll you do?
lf anyone of you lifts your
hands again, then l'll shoot you.
Did you enioy?
- Yes, l did.
Hey Mark! Leave it. He's crazy.
Maior, are you taking sides
with him. - To hell with you all!
l played along with you all thinking
that the job will be done easily..
..l'll get some money.. - And
then you and your girl will..
Shut up! Shut up!
First tell me, how did the
police come there? - They flew in.
They were called.
- By whom?
That's what l'm saying.
There's a traitor amidst us.
You.
- Why? Can't it be you?
How did he come here?
- l brought him.
Why? - Because he'll
tell us who's the traitor.
Since when is he here?
- Since l put him here.
Why did you need to
put up such an act?
You should've brought him directly.
Maior, it's exciting if
there's a twist in the story.
He's asked us a
Iot of questions.
Now it's our turn.
lt'll be fun. It'll be fun.
l don't like this.
He's a policeman.
- l like it.
Because he's a policeman.
Mr. McNairy.
Why do l feel that you're
going to share a secret with me?
l told you that you had committed
a grave mistake by nabbing us.
Maior, don't scare him
too much. He'll die.
Do you know English?
First class. l've spoken
English since childhood.
He speaks since childhood,
but no one understands.
But he'll understand.
Ask him how the
police reached there.
Tell.. - Not you.
You'll take a lot of time.
You ask him.
How were the cops there?
How were the cops there?
Why isn't he speaking?
He must have
ulcers in his mouth.
Ask him now.
How did you know that
we're going to be there?
What did you say?
l asked him that how did he know
that we were going to loot a bank.
You didn't use the word
'bank' at all. - l meant..
You iust say
whatever l can understand.
He's saying the same thing. - Maior,
when did he speak about the bank?
No he didn't.
- He didn't?
Aiiu, tell me something.
Be honest about it.
Who gave you the
passport to come here?
His mother.
She was working in the
passport office since childhood.
You ask him! You ask him!
Answer me.
- What did you say now?
Answer me.
- Answer me!
Give!
Give, it's English. Give.
Give!
Even l'll do it. C'mon! Give!
Give!
Speak or they'll kill you.
What did you say?
What did you say?
What's he
grumbling about! Ask him!
Don't get into my nerves.
Tell someone else to ask.
He'll answer only if
you ask, understood?
You guys are all dead. All dead.
What did he say?
- Nothing. - He said something.
He said that we are all dead..
..meaning we are all dead..
All in Hindi means..
..eVeryOne..
l don't find
anyone dead? Who's dead?
He says that all of
us are going to die.
Who'll kill us? Who!?
Who? Who!?
These guys are maniacs,
they'll kill you.
Tell us who's the
hack amongst us?
What are you going
on about for so long?
Let him ask what he's asking.
lf you want to understand then
Iearn the alphabets first.
l want to know, Maior.
l want to know what plans
they're cooking up in English.
Look! You're an illiterate fellow,
not the rest of us.
We can understand what he's saying.
Ok! l had forgotten
that you all are educated.
Andy, ask him!
lf you want to save your life,
tell them what you know.
One of you.. One of
you is an undercover cop.
What happened?
Why are you looking
at each others faces?
What happened? What did he say?
Maior, what did he say?
Tell me! Tell me,
what did he say?
That one among us..
..is a policeman.
What the hell!
ls it a heartbeat or
the report of a gun?
What'll bring us
close to death?
C'mon take
control of your life..
Who knows when
we'll meet fortune?
l don't have peace,
comfort or tolerance.
This question
keeps haunting me.
Don't know when
death will come.
Whom it'll come for and
whom it'll take away. Death!
lt's necessary for life.
Death!
What kind of a dark
compulsion is this?
Death! We stop when it comes.
lt takes us away in its arms.
Special task operation.
You've to be undercover. Live with
them for a while. Like one of them.
Follow them. Get their deals, get
their contacts and keep informing us.
You've got to get them.
The Indians shouldn't shit here.
We knew about everything.
The guns, the cars, everything.
Tell us who that guy is.
l'll count till three.
One.. two.. three.
Shut up! Drawing a
gun for everything!
Why, Maior? Is it you?
Yes, it could be me. What'll you do?
You'll shoot me? C'mon shoot! Shoot!
No. It can't be you.
Why? Why can't it be you?
This rascal will tell me!
No, Aiiu! Have you gone mad?
Will you kill him?
Will you kill him?
He's a policeman! If you
kill him then the entire..
..police dept. will dig
you out and screw you.
We're already screwed.
This dog has already seen us.
What difference does that make?
Our iob was to rob the bank, split
the booty and keep going. That's all!
The booty's here. And so are we.
Pick up your share
and keep moving.
We don't need to even see
each other's face again.
No need to see each
other's face again.
Pick up your booty and leave.
And forget that pimp..
..who screwed us.
No! None of us will leave
this place until l shoot him.
Aiiu is right.
l'm in dire need
to leave this place.
Unless we find that scoundrel,
none of us will leave this place.
l'm with Aiiu.
And so am l.
Maior?
- Even me.
Ask me as well. Conduct
meetings, conduct conferences.
We've been conducting
conferences since we met.
We had gone to rob a bank
wearing a suit and a tie.
Sit down. C'mon! Sit down.
- Andy! Cut it out!
l'll tell you what to do. We all
should collect the money and..
..accumulate it here.
And then nab that bastard!
Where's the money? - It's
there. Outside. In the car.
l left it on the way. - Where's
yours? - It's here. l'll bring it.
No! Not alone, Mark.
Ajju will come along.
Why? Don't you trust me?
What do we know, pal? You
can be a cop, l can be one.
He can be one. So,
two will go together.
l'll go along with you, Maior.
- Ok. C'mon.
What about me? - Will your
father come to keep an eye on him?
What about me, huh!
Hero, what do you think?
Who's that scoundrel?
Look, l don't want to discuss
anything about this. Let's go.
C'mon! Tell me. - l told you l don't
want to discuss anything about this.
Ok, forget it. Tell me,
how's you girl?
Aiiu, don't even talk about her.
Anyway, there's nothing
between us any longer.
Nothing!? This is good news.
- Why?
l had my eyes on your girl for a
Iong time. She dances so well, man!
When she dances, then
even Baburao dances.
C'mon! Hit me!
What are you
Iaughing for? Hit me! C'mon!
There isn't anything between us.
lf you love her so much
then why don't agree to it.
Look! The iob's done. We
have the money as well.
Now, you go and take her out
of there and take her to India.
And then a dance bar.. don't open..
don't open.. l'm telling you.
Go get the money first.
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! Love isn't enough..
O beloved! Love isn't enough..
..fate wants something more.
l'm stricken by destiny,
what do l do?
l'm stricken by destiny,
what do l do?
l'm stricken by destiny,
what do l do?
Who has control over destiny?
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!
On one hand, love is forlorn..
On the other, the
body is crestfallen.
On one hand, love is forlorn..
On the other, the
body is crestfallen.
Both have been rendered
helpless such that there's..
..no one to whom l can complain.
O beloved!
O beloved, what
fate have l met?
My fate deserves
something better.
The heart shouldn't break,
it is the house of the Lord.
ln your command my head bows.
The heart shouldn't break,
it is the house of the Lord.
ln your command my head bows.
l'm not afraid of death.
l'm iust afraid of
being separated from you.
O beloved!
O beloved! Love isn't enough..
..fate wants something more.
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!

Whoa! Mark! Don't you know
you're not supposed to be here?
l've got to see her, man. -
Hey! It's the boss' orders.
You know how this works.
You know how this works, buddy?
This is a .44 magnum
with hollow point slugs.
Goes in real small
comes out real big.
Can you handle
the damage, buddy?
So you can speak
English as well, eh?
Sometimes. Go and get your bird.
Aiiu! l've seen smarter
guys but none better than you.
Mark!
Mark!
Please take me away from here. -
That's what l've come here for.
Lisa, today at 7pm
at L.A. airport..
..will you wait for me?
- Yeah.
Ok.
- Yes.
How did you come inside my club?
How did you come in?
- Through the door.
Then go out through the door.
Out! Out! Out!
Lisa! l had warned you that
l don't want any personal..
..love stories within my club.
And Lisa, this good for
nothing will give you nothing. Ok?
Time for the show, baby.
- No more shows.
Lisa, go now. l'll
meet you at 7pm.
Lisa! You leave my club
once and you can't come back.
She doesn't want to
come back. Shut up!
Bye! Take care.
- l'll take care of you soon.
Hey what about a Harry? - Hey
man! That's an old piece of shit.
This is the new babe.
Takes a man out..
..in one shot. l bet!
This is a heavy bitch.
Like the one with
the heavy tits, man?
Shall we go, British?
- English, brother. - Sorry.
Let's move?
- Alright. - Come.
Take your babe. - l don't leave home
without this, man. Take care, man.
Everyone went with a partner.
Now sit. Police! Police!
l'm the cop.
And you're the captive.
So lets begin
where it all started.
Where's the truck?
Tell me, who's the policeman?
Who's the cop?
The money is kept at
the back. What do we do?
You had said.. -Look, Andy. l've never
been dishonest throughout my life.
You know what kind of
people we're working with.
One's a cop, and two are crazy..
Why should we go back? Let's
split the booty here itself.
No. - Andy, you're
talking like a fool.
l know all about you.
You've a wife who doesn't want to live
with you. A child whom you can't meet.
Because you don't have money.
Think about it. Such an opportunity
won't knock at your door again.
You can put your life together again.
No, Maior.
l have a wife who's very ill.
You do whatever you want,
l won't tell anyone.
No one knows how
much money we've stolen.
No one has counted it yet.
What difference will it make
if you take a few bundles out of it?
You're very straightforward
like me. You can't be an informer.
Maior, you're testing..
Maior!
What's this?
Maybe we won't return alive
from the place we're headed to.
At least this will
be of use to someone.
The iob got
successfully completed.
Those people were very pleased. l'll
book our airline ticket on the way.
l'll be back..
O Lord, give me back my love.
Who'll stand by me
if not my companion?
Who'll stand by me
if not my companion?
l asked you something
that belonged to me..
Or did l ask for
something l didn't own.
Or did l ask for
something l didn't own.
Let her die! Let her die!
Let her die as my own. l
ask you for your godliness.
l ask you for your godliness.
l ask you for your godliness.
l ask you for your godliness.
l ask you for your godliness.
You're hanging!
You're hanging.
Tell me who's the cop.
l give you three chances.
Tell me, who's the cop.
One.
Two.
Go to hell.
Three.
Who killed him?
l did.
Why?
Hadn't l killed him then
he would've killed that cop.
So you killed him?
lf l hadn't, then he
would've killed him, then me..
..and taken the
money and escaped.
The one with whom you
stayed for 6 months.
The one with whom
you fooled the world..
..today you killed that
fellow himself.
What could l've done? He
had hung him like a donkey.
That guy was shouting and
Bali was laughing like mad men.
How can we kill a policeman?
So you killed him in order
to save this guy's life?
Who said we can't kill a cop?
Look, we kill a cop
like this. Understood?
We kill a cop like this.
Aiiu! C'mon!
What's this? What happened?
Who killed him?
l killed him.
- Why?
Because he killed Bali.
Who killed Bali?
He did.
How many times do l
explain to you, man?
He had gone mad. Not
gone mad, he was mad.
He was planning to kill everyone
and escape with all the booty.
You love all of us so much
that you killed your companion.
Either it's written all
over my face that l'm a fool.
Or you're so foolish to
think that l'm a fool.
Just a minute.
Look, Mac won't lie.
lt's true that
Bali had gone mad.
He had spoken of escaping
with the booty, even to me.
Bali was mad, Maior.
But he wasn't a police informer.
He wanted to kill a policeman,
not save him.
Who tried to save
the cop? He did.
Then who's the rat? Bali or Mac?
He saved himself not the cop.
Maior why are you always
taking sides with him?
ls there always something
happening between you and him?
C'mon, Maior.
l know that you're not that rat.
But neither is Aiiu nor me.
And Andy has been a straight
guy right from the beginning.
The one remaining is this guy.
Listen to me.
He took the bullet meant
for me and saved my life.
Had he been a policeman..
..then why would he have done so?
- It could've been an accident.
Maior, why do you forget
that he's been with us..
..iust for the past six months.
Who knew about him before that?
Neither did l know
him nor did you?
l'm telling you he isn't a cop.
Bali was mad but he isn't a cop.
Bali was mad, Maior.
But he can never think of
stealing someone's share.
lf he had wanted to shoot,
then he could've shot Bali on his leg.
And then he
could've waited for us.
But no, he was only
worried about this dog.
He wasn't worried about Bal.
l've been telling from the
beginning to split..
..the booty and keep moving your
own way. One's already gone!
Are you waiting for
the rest of us to die?
C'mon!
Do we leave the one who
helped the police reach us?
Had l been a cop, then wouldn't
l've said that Bali's a cop..
..and that that's the
reason l shot him.
Then l would've torn
you to shreds, rascal!
Bali hated policemen as
much as he hated his father.
Andy is right.
Let's take our money
and move from here.
l won't leave
while this guy's alive.
This guy has to die.
Look, Aiiu.
Today, neither am
l going anywhere..
..nor is anyone waiting for me.
l couldn't save my wife.
l couldn't fulfill the
promise that l made to her.
l won't let him die.
Ok?
So why don't you
just drop the gun?
C'mon! Drop the gun!
Drop it!
Sorry, Maior. But Aiiu is right.
Drop your gun.
l said drop your gun, Maior.
Who asked you to speak in between?
This matter is between Aiiu and
Major. Stay out of it, man.
Shut up!
Drop your guns!
You're trying to
kill the wrong person.
l'm not going to stop. - That too for
that rogue. - Lower your guns.
Save yourself, Maior.
Maior, Aiiu is right. Maior!
Drop your guns, Maior!
Maior, he's dead!
Mac!
Sorry, buddy.
l couldn't save you.
l'm sorry, Maior.
l was iust doing my duty.
l was only doing my duty.
Maior..
Maior, l had told you.
l couldn't gather the
courage to look into Major's eyes.
l iust closed my eyes
and waited for death.
l didn't come to know
when it came and went by.
Aiiu used to say that one day or the
other, all of us have to go to hell.
Even l'm going there.
l know that the rest of them
would be waiting for me there.
They'll ask me why
l did such a thing.
l don't know
what l'll tell them.
l hadn't thought that
fate would bring me here.
On reaching the goal,
we would lose our lives.
No one had thought
that before coming here..
..ioy would leave us.
What had we thought
and what happened?
We're leaving today,
telling this world..
Oh what happened, Oh God?
Oh what happened, Oh God?
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Was it your fault or mine?
Was it your pride or mine?
O God, l wouldn't
have been so bad..
..hadn't you
been so heartless.
Just tell me, what
did you get by this?
By laying these thorns
of sorrow in my path.
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Los Angeles, 12th of May, 2000.
Where we six rogues first met.
We had thought that we
would win over the world..
..but we got screwed instead.
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Oh what happened, Oh God!
Oh what happened, Oh God!
