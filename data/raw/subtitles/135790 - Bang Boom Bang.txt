Translation: René Minarski
Is that awesome or what?
I'm telling you. You slightly hit the gas pedal
and "BANG" you you broke the sound barrier. 
Just like with the Misses. You can ride this or that model, a sporty one or an oldtimer.
You can rent a car every once in a while, or maybe you need a van sometimes.
For a trip, or moving your stuff.
But you need one vehicle that suits you.
With style, with character, you get me?
A baby to love. You have to care, stroke it...fuel it
Also put money in. Baby wants to be entertained.
And maybe it will stay untill the end of your life.
Your property
You know how many cars I drove in my life?
The most I just crashed, I didn't care. But this one...
I fell in love immediately
But Kalle this colour is toally old fasioned.
Did I tell you to open your mouth?
Did I allow you to talk?
Watch it dude.
If I have something to discuss, you shut up.
Forget that ashole. Thinks he is a big fucker cause he tried to rape a chick once.
I've spent 3 and a half years in this shithole. And every night I have the same dream.
I run that car with 240 on the highway. That's my freedom!
I order the car now. 2 years ahead. And when I come out I want my wife, wearing highheels
coming in that car Mercedes 500 SEC
Fueld and cleaned up, to pick me up. Is that possible?
Sure, I can get you the car.
So how much would I have to pay for that?
Well...the car itself 25 thousand.
Papers and license plate is another 15. So 40 grand among friends, ok?
I got one buddy out there. He ows me one.
A real jerk, always stoned, lazy as...how the hell should I know how lazy he is.
His name is Dirk, but the morons in the neighbourhood can't pronounce that. 
So we call him Cake.
But the guy is alright.
BABG BOOM BANG    A bulletproove job
Morning Maike - Hi Cake
You went to the stadium this week?
No, some ashole stole my season ticket.
Really? That sucks
Tell me about it
My friend said the game was awesome.
Say Maike. Where is "Diddi der Doppelgänger"?
Some video junkie must have kept that one. Can you check?
Ohh honey, that action on the pool table wasn't good for my back.
Yo Cake, good to see you.
Frankie, what's up?
All easy. Wait, I got something for you.
Didn't you come down there?
Nope, I can't come this week.
Don't go away, I'll be right back.
Alright
Cake, could it be that you rented that movie?
You've had it for 3 month already.
Shit, I'll try to find it at home. You got anything new?
Everything in the newcomer section
Never mind. Here "Cheech and Chong" I'll take that.
Your card
There you go. "Hole in one"
Your titty movies?
Just the best, 90 minutes hardcore. True feelings.
Am I on that one too?
Nope, guess
No way? Yep, just me. Just watch it. I'm the best, beleive me.
Who are you jerks?
We have an offer for you.
Get lost
What do you think about car radios?
UFO!

Yeayea
Do you speak German?
Yes I do
So we talked on the phone. I'm Werner Kampmann
My son: Mark
Had a good journey?

A good drive on german highways, eh?
German highway good
Alright, let's go to my office to talk about the business.
Schlucke!
Open the gate, so they can unload the computers.
Let's get busy. That's all for you.
I had something to do.
Ahh reached the next level? Listen I have an awesome bet fro you.
Leave me alone with your awesome bets. Remember last time?
Who cares, it's 40:1 now. We have to bet.
We? that's my money
It's not your money it's Kalles' money. So how much?
Are you sure we're gonna win this time?
Horst is a luck horse.
Horst is the name of the jockey?
The horse is called Horst
What? the horses' name is Horst? How is that gonna work?
I bet 40, alright?
How much do I have left?
About 45
Oh shit. Bet 25
I hope he wins, otherwise I'm in deep trouble.
I promise you won't regret that.
I hope so
alright, see ya
All on Horst
Fits exactely. Mark: get our friends some titty calendars.
So you have something to bring home.
What do you want Schlucke?
Everything is loaded on the trucks. 
Mark, go say bye to our friends.
Have a nice trip. And be careful at the border.
Was a good deal.
For me too. Bye
Same game as always. Luigi arrives at the airport at 15.20.
He get's the bag.
Alright boss.
Gotta go to the stadium. You can reach me on the mobile.
Are you alright?
Get up sissy. It was your fault.
Why do you have to hold your dick in my shot? Get off the field I wanna play on.
Watch it dude!
What's that pussyface? I kick your ass so you shit spaghetti.
well show me then.
Stop it.
Play on.
Potatoe fucker.
Isn't he cute?
Well talk to him.
I don't know. Don't think he is interested in me.
Ohh it's you, come in,
The visit is in half an hour.
yaya I'm coming.
Dress up nice
What's going on?
"What's going on?"?
What?
Who're you?
Mind if I ask you first?
Listen, no need to show off cause you had your first one night stand.
Calm down
What the hell?
Should I live like a nun, cause the ashole is in jail?
No need to live like slut either.
It's Schlucke, been waiting for half an hour.
Yea I know, Luigis won't come. You can come to the stadium.
Alright
Where is the bag?
Right here
Put it in a safe and bring me the key to the stadium.
Got it
What's the score?
0 : 0
What's with him?
He knocked out his opponent.
Way to go Andy!
I pay for the red card
And you do like Andy! I don't want any more sissyboy ballet!
Ahh cutie, got the letters ready?
They go out tomorrow
That's what I call a hot trainee. She got titts that make your eyes pop out. - One Sausage
The fat pigs is so disgusting.
Took pretty long
What did you think? That I forgot how to fuck?
Better than your dildo, honey?
Of course
Why am I here anyway?
My cigarettes
There you go
Here, something to watch when your wife isn't there.
Thanks, those are popular in here
You gotta do something for me
What is it?
I ordered this car you know?
The Mercedes?
Exactely. With that one you pick me up here in 23 months
In high heels
Isn't that a little risky?
Yea you got a point. For the driving you should wear flat shoes.
The guy where I ordered the car his name is "rat". That's his address.
how much?
40
No problem
Cash! and don't let them rip you off again.
My friend is a mechanic, I'll take him with me.
Andy, that was some action. That's what I like.
That stupid ashole. I met him again I punch him in the face again. - That's right, just knock him out.
Listen we gotta talk about your insurance.
The deadline is soon.
Shouldn't I see another doctor?
Gerd Gehbauer is one of the best doctors. And he said there is nothing we can do.
Look at it that way: You're well insured, you get enough pension.
And if you don't do too much sports with the leg you won't have any more problems.
I got it all filled out for you. All you need to do is sign.
Take it home, read it, and bring it back next week.
Gotta go.
And what about my trial practice?
Well the dream of becoming a professional is over.
Damn, I always waited for that chance.
Come on, be realistic! Your current job is not so bad.
Hey Cake, meet Mila and this is....sorry forgot your name. - Valeria 
Yo did you watch my video: "Hole in one"?
Of course
Am I awesome or what?
Yea awesome
Hey champ, calmed down again?
What do you want?
Andy you can't knock out everybody. Now you're disqualified again.
So what? The fucking knee can't go 90 minutes anyway.
Getting upset won't help. Here, some one, will help you relax.
Can't you do that alone?
You know I know nothing about cars.
Alright I have a look, but I can't drive it back here.
Why not?
Lost my license for 5 months.
When was that?
The day before yesterday. 23 kmh too fast
5 months for that?
Yea I argued with the cops a little. The bastards hid their radar behind a garbage can.
You just gotta drive the car back here 30 km at max.
Hey when they catch me I loos the license for a year. what do I do without license as a mechanic?
Hey Andy
Schlucke old friend
You got a driving license?
Yep
Alright, got time tomorrow evening?
Yes
Do you know that you never smile at me during work?
Satisfied?
So you're playing the bitch?
Admitt it, you want me. Why else would you wear that tight shirt.
You wanna put away the lollipop and suck my dick instead?
Jerk of in the bathroom but leave me alone.
I don't need that. I had a nice wild fuck last night.
And now your butt hurts?
Honeybunch? Hitting on my son again?
I think "honeybunch" doesn't like our firm anymore.
You said the letters are ready.
I said the letters go out tomorrow.
90-60-90 the grades why we hired you here.
Now leave us alone. We have some business do discuss, only the guys, ay Schlucke?
Ain's she cute, our "honeybunch"? Hopefully she'll stay here untill you got to bang her Mark.
Gotta hurry though, cause that's all she is good for.
Everything done.
Of course Schlucke, you're my best man.
Have a seat, we need to talk.
Take mine.
Thanks
Listen, you need to do me a favour. Tomorrow night is the party from the football club.
And I need you to break in here during that.
Break the door open, make some mess in here...
But why should I break into our own company?
We want to rip of the insurance. That way we get the money from the polish guys and from the insurance.
Boss, you know I was in jail before.
What's the worth thing that can happen?
Nono, not like that Mark. If he has a problem we gotta talk about it.
How long have you been working for me now?
20 years
20 years?
Did I ever let you down in those 20 years?
No boss
See?
Remember how I got my friend Brinkmann to be your lawyer?
When you had that "peeping Tom" lawsuit.
Sure
See? I always supported you. And now you have to do something for me.
One for another, that's friendship.
Want one?
Thanks
Fire
You wanna stay in the company for 20 more years?
of course
Keep it
Put it in your pocket.
Alright I do it.
There you go. Excellent, I knew you're getting things done.
Well it's not that dangerous.
Of course Schlucke, it's a bulletproove job.
Let's go get wasted.
Frankie's fuck parade
Hole in one
Wow, can you show me that?
Come on, get down to business.
Nobody wants to see you stupid face! Show the chick!
Who the hell filmed that?
Finally you turned off that crap.
That chick was ugly as hell, right?
Shut up!
I was gonna call you.
Was it a close race?
Well, it was a close race. But Horst had a bad day, what should I do?
What? You said he's a favroite.
He was. I went there happy and all cause I was thinking "Ayy cake makes some money"... 
But the stupid horse gets in second place.
And the money?
Is gone
You know how it is. On bad days you loose on good days you win.
And why do we always bet on bad days? How can you bet on stupid Horst?
Well we still have 20 left.
But tha car costs 40
You need 40? Why don't you tell me? I take care.
Horst was my granpas name, the more often I hear it the stupider it sounds.
I have to get Kalle a car. So I tell him:" Hey you're a good friend"
Thanks for keeping quite for 4 years. By the way I lost your money. Horst had a bad day"
Are you done? for you
Are you kidding me? What are those duds?
I reacted the same. Cheap duds from Poland.
They rip of me, we rip somebdy else off. It's a circle, get it?
You gotta mix them. One true one fake, one true one fake...
fake, true, fake, true, get it?
Could have got that idea earlyer.
What?
Ignition
I guess that's supposed to be an engine
I call my colleague, he can have a look.
What?
Come here
Well you do the job
You think you can relegate this season? I watch all the games.
Push the gas panel
So?
Not bad for a 20 year old car. Maybe exchange the spark plugs.
Great, I wanna go on holiday with that.
What's going on?
You can leave it here. Give me your number and I call when the car is ready.
Tomorrow afternoon I guess
Write it here.
Thanks
OK, see you tomorrow.
Seeya
She's a fan of you.
Sure, and I got her number. Let's go by that car, I have to go to practice later.
Why don't you have the car delivered?
Don't worry, we know what we're doing.
It's a used car ehh?
It's not really legal, alright?
Just drive my car back home.
And appart from that just keep your mouth shut.
I know these things.
I'm planing one thing myself.
A bulletproove job.
Come on, who are you kidding?
A little burglary.
Got it all checked out.
So that's the car.
Just as you ordered it.
You got the 40 thousand?
Sure we wanna take the car rightaway.
Gimme that
I counted it.
What's the year of construction?
88
Did it ever crash before?
What?
There are seams here
what is he saying?
And the chassis looks obligue.
The car is fine. what the hell? No negotiation.
And there won't be any. Hey the price was fixed!
Nothing was fixed.
Is he biting?
Is the money alright?
Come out there the deal is off.
You shut up, this car had a crash before.
The car is completely fine.
It's bullshit, look at this.
What?
Nothing get up.
Andy, the car is ok. Let's take it. 
Wait cake, they are trying to screw us...
Ole, problem!
That guy is causing trouble.
I know these guys for years. They were always clean.
What is he doing here?
What do you want? got a problem?
Easy guys, just give us back the money and we think about it again.
Andy, get out there.
Listen, the guys brought the car here from Hamburg. You can't just give it back.
Hey asshole if we don't want the car we don't take it!
Andy, it's alright.
The car looks nice
Shut up Schlucke, I won't let them screw me!
Help
I think it's better we take off now.
Alright, we take it.
what do you bother about anyway? Everything went fine.
Best opportunity to get rid of the duds. Those stupid danes don't know how our money looks like.
Schlucke crapped is pants.
That guy is so fucked up.
"I'm planing one thing myself"
No alarm, there is a lot to steal.
Laptops, you know? I' know all about it.
Sounds nice
When are you going for it?
Tomorrow evening
Alright, I'm in.
What?
well I'm in!
No you can't. I can only do that alone.
Stop bullshitting me: I'm in, ok?
If not I call the cops.
He broke out of jail last night. Karl-Heinz Grabowsky is known for violent behaviour.
Shortly before his escape he severely insured another prisoner. Grabowsky was sentenced in July 1995
for several Bank roberies in Dortmund.
Joining us life Deputee Kurt Schröder.
Mr. Schröder, what is the current satus of the investigation?
Well shortly after the escape of Karl-Heinz Grabowsky we started an intense search.
but we are not certain about the current location of...
You? Here?
I just saw you on tv.
What about that fucking porn movie?
Kalle, what's the matter?
Did you watch that perverted shit?
NO, not yet.
You got a gun?
No, you know I don't like guns. It's against my conviction.
Weapons do nothing good.
I got something.
what are you doing with that knife?
I cut that bastard.
Who?
The asshole that fucked my wife!
Who?
The porn jerk fucked my wife!
What?
How dare he fuck my wife?!
I'll kill him.
Cool car ay??
Gimme the key.
Isn't the car cool?
Yeayea, cool cool, get in.
Don't you wanna think about it?
Maybe he didn't know...
I'm pissed off! Where was the damn store?
You just passed it.
We could have walked here.
Wait here, I see if he's in.
Hi, is Franky here?
I didn't see him.
Is he downstairs maybe?
Some people are there but I don't know about him?
I go down there.
And tell them to be more quiet.
Thanks for hiring me boss. I was unemployed for many years.
Yes you have good work in my company.
Can I interrupt for a second?
What the hell? we're taping here.
I gotta talk to Frankie, is he here?
I can't work like that. The boner is down immediately.
Ohh come on, you always have errection problems.
Easy, I'll be gone soon.
Franky ain't here. Can we get back to work now?
Uwe, give me a minute please.
Can I call him? Give me your mobile please.
Franky, some joker wants to talk to you.
He didn't tell me his name.
Go back there, would you?
Thank god I reached you, it's Cake.
Hey Cake you horny horse. Need new videos?
Did you nail Manuela Grabowsky in your "fuck-parade"?
Manuela Grabowsky? Noo
Think
Ohh, Manu? Sure
Ohh you idiot. Manuele is Kalles' wife. He broke out of prison last night and wants to kill you now.
Relax dude. Who is Kalle?
Kalle Grabowski
Still there?
Ohh shit
How can he break break out?
Who cares, run away immediately.
Maybe I should talk to him?
Listen, just run! Kalle is not the chatty kind of person.
Damn what am I gonna do now?
Leave the city, now!
OK I'm right there.
What? Noo don't come here!
Call him again
Quick!
Don't come to the studio! Kalle is here.
Get in
That's it. Where is my money?
Sparkasse
I adjusted your engine too.
excellent. What do I owe you?
Give me 35 for the new spark plugs.
Only 35?
That's service.
Let me invite you for an ice cream.
Cool, I'm done here anyway.
Willi, I take off for today.
What? You're crazy?
Ohh, what's up?
You don't even have a regular income. We can't give you a credit.
I'm sorry Mr....
Cake
Don't you have a relative that can give you money?
Forget it. Thank you.
Alright
Where is the money?
It's not that easy.I have to do the paperwork first.
I bought this car for example.
That was 40
I invested the money. Don't you think it would have looked supicious...
if an unemployed guy like me had 200.000mark on his account?
How should I know that you're back all of a sudden?
I come over tomorrow and take my money. Now get out.
I don't wanna spent my entire life here.
But not everybody can do what he wants.
That is just what the job counsellor told me. And gave me a paper saying what I am most suiteable for.
Secretary, florist, tax consultant assistant... thanks a lot.
But you have a job at Kampmann now.
Not anymore. Since today 9.00a.m.
Did you quit?
Not quite, he fired me. But I was gonna leave anyway.
Why did he fire you?
Too many private phone calls.
How much did you cost him?
How should I know? When I'm sitting in the office all I might as well call a friend. 
And now?
I'll go away now.
You gotta do something.
I didn't say I was gonna do nothing. I wanna enjoy my life now.
Most people here don't even try to make something out of their lifes.
They just dream their dream, and one day they realize that they can't even remember their dream.
Do you have a dream?
I'm a realist.
Realists are boring.
Am I boring?
Not on the first impression. Otherwise I wouldn't be here with you.
And on the second impression?
What is your impression of me?
What is that freak doing here?
Hi
I have to talk to you.
Yea have a seat.
Not here.
Do we have to do this now?
Yes now, it's urgent.
How long?
Just come with me.
Sorry, the guy is pretty crazy.
Too bad I would have liked to get a second impression.
Let's meet again tonigh.
When?
10p.m., fooball club bar?
I'll be there.
See you, thanks.
You know Schlucke better.
Exactely and therefore I know that he is an idiot.
The other day he told me that he had sex with 3 girls at a time on the train.
And last week he rode a truck from here to Cologne in 1.5 hours. So screw it.
But maybe there is something to steal. And if not we have a lot of fun.
What's the matter? You need cash?
I have some tax repayments. 
If I can't pay they're gonna take my car.
Your car?
Bastards right? So yes or no?
You're busting my balls sometimes.
Sorry for interrupting your date. - Actually you came at the right moment. She just started her "psycho shit".
Gimme five.
I do it alone.
Man we're colleagues.
No, I do this alone!
I've never seen him like that. Let's go, that way I won't miss my date.
Isn't that...?
What is that guy doing here?
That's none of your business.
Schlucke? Did you tell him about your plans too?
You gotta be kidding me. You gotta be kidding me!
Are you looking for trouble?
Alright stay calm guys.
Are you nuts? I thought we were colleagues?
But Rat is a collegue too.
A colleague? You just met that jerk yesterday.
Easy! We do that job together ok? Or do you have a problem with that?
No I don't have a problem.
Screw it. We wanna do a burglary and the whole city knows about it.
Andy, relax.
So you wanna take off?
Well we had an appointment at 9.30.
9.30 is long gone. Get going.
Sure, I'll be right there.
You mean we go right now?
Better don't loose any time. Maybe otherwise the idiot prints his plan in the newspaper.
Man my date.
You're saying that this chick is more important than our thing?
I just keep appointments usually.
You can hook up with her tomorrow. She wants you.
Just let him go, more to steal for us.
Shut up. What are you looking at anyway?
Nothing, everything's alright.
What the hell is that?
Camouflage
I didn't know Schlucke was gonna rob Kampmann. I'm out of here.
Don't leave me alone with those freaks.
You wanna go in there you go without me, alright?
Well than at least stay in the car and look out.
30 minutes and I am gone.
Has Andy been here before?
No he's probably at Kampmans' party.
Schlucke, what are we supposed to steal here?
Hmm my boss must have delivered. Sorry. Let's go home then.
No way we're taking off now. Once we are here we can have a look into the office.
Can you crack that?
No way - Damn it
Let's go then.
Wait
You think Schlucke screwed up again? The cops should have called us already.
That useless fool. I should have fired him long ago.
Where did you learn that?
Never watched "crime investigations"?
You can't do that.
Why?
What if the cops come?
What about the cops?
Fine, go outside and watch out.
Come on, get out Schlucke.
Can I pay please?
2,50
Oh don't you have smaller change?
Never mind, I charge Andy for it.
Thanks
See you
What are they doing up there?
They are opening the safe deposit box.
You're a genius. Nice work.
Andy, check this out. Am I awesome or what?
Are you crazy? You cracked the fucking safe deposit box.
What was that?
Guys there is something out there. Some noise.
OK stay calm, Andy follow me.
What are you looking for?
Maybe it was just a bird. Screw it, let's get lost.
Just emptying the deposit before.
Come on, hurry.
Just a minute.
I check on the two idiots.
Did you see something?
Where is Schlucke?
Took off
Took off?
He screwed us. There is nothing to steal here. So he took of and that's ecaxtely what I do now.
Well beat it then. You shouldn't have been here anyway, asshole!
There are only files, no money.
Let's go then. Schlucke and the psycho took off already.
What?
Well they took off, they got out of here. I told you the guy is an idiot.
Instead of spending the night in bed with a girl I break into the company of my own club president.
Are you crazy?
Sorry, I didn't see you got your hand in there.
Damn it won't open anymore.
No joking now please.
I'm not joking. It's blocked somehow.
Let me try it. You can get me some bandaid.
You have a frist aid box in the car?
No but there has to be one here somewhere.
The rod is shifted.
I can't access the lock anymore.
Let me see.
The thumb is off. Completely off.
The first trucks arrive soon. We should go.
Are you crazy? I want my thumb back! And also the cops have my fingerprints.
When they find my thumb in there I'm screwed. I might as well leave my address on the top.
We have to weld it open. Come on help me.
Willi has a welding torch.
Watch out I can use one hand only.
Speed up. The bleeding is getting worth.
How long do we have?
Don't know. Maybe 1.5 hours but I'm not sure. So speed up otherwise I can't hold a joint anymore.
My car!
Dude we ran into a radar control.
Ohh look at that.
You told me to speed up.
But not in front of the radar control.
Gotta be a new one.
Is you baseball batt still in the car?
What do you want with that?
A foto while draging a safe depost box on the road is not a good idea.
Willi, wake up.
Why the hell are you waking me up in the middle of the night? There are other people living here.
Sorry, we have a serious problem. You gotta help us.
Darling, honey is with you soon.
There you got the problem.
My friend cut off his thumb.
And I'm supposed to screw it back on?
Just come down here.
You're killing me.
What the hell is this? This guy needs a hospital.
As stupid as it sounds, but his thumb is in there. You gotta weld it open.
How did it get in there?
That is a long story and we have little time.
I'd be glad if you could just open the box.
Who drilled that?
Me
You're kidding me? You stole it.
It's an emergency.
Where does the safe deposit box come from?
From Kampmanns' company.
What? You gotta be kidding me?
So the tracks lead straight from Kampmanns company to my gas station?
Not only do you look like shit, you are shit!
They just lead the cops all the way to the gasoline pump.
We can drag it on later.
And where? To Marocco or what?
You guys can be glad that I hate Kampmann, that fat pig.
Otherwise you could bury your thumb in there, got that? Don't look like that!
Ahh what am I upset about?
Let's go.
What's with the files?  - Screw the files. Where's my thumb?
Stay calm buddy.
Ohh I got it. It's so dirty. Are you sure it's yours?
You have some ice to cool it?
Sure, and call me Willi.
Hurry up Willi.
Yaya, there you go. Hurry to the hospital.
And keep the remaining fingers off the nurses.
I'll take care of the box.
Look Petra. It's the...
So how is the situation?
Wanna have a look?
No, no thanks. Is it gonna get back on?
Can't be sure yet, but it looks not bad.
Insurance files Andreas Fink
You had a knee insury?
Yes, from playing football.
The left outer meniscus.
Operable. That means it can be fully cured, right?
Yea sure. You need to go to a specialist but it's not a problem nowadays.
What do you wanna do now?
I go to Kampmann.
And then?
The asshole was gonna make me a cripple like Schlucke, just so that he can get the insurance money.
You wanna punsch him in the face? Think about it. You want the whole world to know who broke in the company?
Shit, I can't roll a joint anymore.
Is that your only problem?
Right now it is.
Fine
Where is my money?
Don't bust my balls. I spend your damn money and now piss off.
I want my money.
Dude, you're nuts. What the hell?
That is just beween Kampmann and me.
Wrong it's a thing between Kampmann, you, my car, the cops over there and my ass.
Take your car and go.
This is my baseball bat.
Andy, forget him. The fat pig is not worth it. We have more serious problems.
First we gotta find Schlucke before the cops get him.
Good bye. It will look the same tomorrow.
Holgi, old buddy.
Cake. Hi Andy.
Drove a little fast the other day ehh?
Did somebody kill Kampmann?
Romanians
Romanians here in Unna?
Since the iron curtain is gone they are everywhere. Always with the same strategy.
Rip out the safe depost box and drive off with it.
We found it already. They threw it into a fish pont, crazy eh?
Totally
And what brings you here?
Weather
Sure, it's pretty nice today.
OK see you, I gotta work.
Alright, go get them.
Where is your weirdo Schlucke today?
Didn't come to work, and he better shouldn't, the boss is really pissed off.
Alright move the car away. Look at that, those people have respect for nothing.
But they hit it nice in the middle. I would have liked to see that.
You think I could order the new Z3 now?
You also think it was the Romanians?
The romanians didn't know what was in there.
But Schlucke, that son of a bitch, knew that the key was in the box.
But he could have ran of with the money in the first place.
Whatever is goin on in his "dog brain". He didn't come to work today.
He is probably off off and aways with the money.
And what if we have the box at the airport opened?
You remember the number on the key?
No
See. Shall I have them all opened? Sometimes I can't beleive you're my son.
Who knows with what alcoholic your mother was fucking around back then. Find Schlucke!
Schlucke, we just want to talk.
You have a credit card?
Is there an ATM in the basement? - Give me your knife.
What's that smell? Did he ever open a window?
Delicious, living plates.
He needs it. But what else can he do? Can't get a girl and hookers are too expensive.
Al least he's got an answering machine.
Schlucke, it's Mark, if you don't come to work soon...
You stupid bastard, you know how much this thing is worth. Tell me where you brought the safe deposit box or I'll get you.
I told you, that thing last night had to be good for something. Give me Kampmanns' number.
Are you missing something since yesterday?
Who is there?
Just call me Ned Flanders.
Alright Mr. Flanders. What do you want?
What do we want to have for it? 10.000?
No
Go for it. Say 20.
Are you still there?
We want 20.000 mark for the stuff in your safe deposit box.
How do I know everything is there?
Did you ever watch the Simpsons?
No, what's that?
You should, then you knew how honest Ned Flanders is. Get the 100.000 mark.
100? you just said 20.
We changed our mind. Or don't you think the stuff is worth that?
If so, we just forget our chat and I give everything to the police.
Alright, 100.000 but that's it.
100.000. How long do you need to get the money?
2 hours.
I call again.
I send him to the stadium. You know the bushes behind the high wall?
Where they put glass on top to keep people from climbing over?
Sure, at the stadium. We're on the way.
You don't wanna call the cops?
No way. All those papers they should better not see... What the hell is he doing?
And when they find out that there is no money in there?
I don't have 100.000 mark to give away right now.
Turn the lock. That should give us some time too.
And if it were the Romanians?
Then I have this one.
Hey, the car of that stupid asshole.
You see the bastard somewhere?
No
There is no mirror over here.
Let's take this thing. It's much better.
Hey Andy
What are you running here? Practicing? where are you going?
Nowhere
Get in
Who is he talking to?
Don't know
Listen Andy, You can do me a favour.
What is it?
You know where our second team is standing.
Not so good.
Exactely, which is why I have to pull some strings there.
There is some money in that suitcase. Take it and throw it over the wall at the stadium.
Sombody behind the wall receives the money.
Alright, your stuff is in the grabage can near "Spiel 2000". But I'd better hurry, who knows when they pick up the garbage.
Asshole
Why didn't you call?
How was I supposed to call? Just be glad that Kampmann was stupid enough not to get a thing.
It's still not open? Yesterday you crack that safe deposit box and now you can't open a crappy suitcase?
Yesterday I had both hands.
I stop over there to get a drink.
Shit
What?
The fat pig screwed us. Nothing but newspapers and a mobile phone.
A cell phone? Why that?
Maybe he makes fun of us cause I called from a public phone.
Hey my car.
That was Rat. We gotta tell the cops.
Man, if we tell them we're going to jail as well.
We can't let him get aways with it.
The guy is dangerous. He would pull us into that.
Where do we want to bury Schlucke?
Up in the forest.
How about some help here??
I'm the lookout. I can't digg with my hand anyway.
We can offer you Sardinia, Jersey or Madeira.
Which one is the farest?
Madeira
Can you pay for us?
Sure
You can't seriousely surveil all the boxes.
Listen that is our only chance to get the money back.
They are already gone with the money.
If I always gave up so easy I'd still be a little shop owner.
We surveil these boxes around the clock. You 8 hours, me 8 hours.
After 48 hours they expire anyway.
Now you learn what it is like to work hard.
Ey my Spiderman comics.
Leave it. They smell already.
Are you crazy? These are the first episodes.
You know what they are worth?
Just shut up for one minute.
That's life.
Ashes to ashes.
Ignorant asshole. What do you know about life? You're just stoned all day.
We just buried a man and he is worth much more than your damn Spiderman comics.
Schlucke was my coach in the junior team. That was before he was alcoholic.
But later nobody wanted to have anything to do with him. Nobody will miss him.
So at least we could show him some respect.
Nonono
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all day.
Did you bring the cops here?
Get rid of them.
Hello, can we come in?
You know... you know the name Karl-Heinz Grabowski?
It's an old friend of mine.
When did you see him for the last time?
I visited him in jail the other day.
When was that?
2 or 3 days ago.
It was the day before yesterday.
We do our job.
What?
And you haven't seen him ever since?
No
are there any smokes left?
Well, can't work all the time.
Nothing here. Let's go.
I'm trying to quit anyway.
But you like smoking too ehh?
Every once in a while.
I told you it takes a while to get the money.
I've been running around all day just to organize your money.
With these fucking cops always following me, it can take a while.
How much longer?
Tomorrow
Alright, tomorrow we go get my money. Tonight I stay here.
Here?
Sure, they checked here anyway.
And where else should I go? Manuela ran off, that bitch.
Vietnam
Shit
I think you broke one of my ribs.
Stop whining, it'll heal. What did you do there?
I got my thumb in a...
I drove the car to Frankfurt. The IAA has opened, just in time.
You drove around? You're wanted. man.
I had to test ride the car.
where is the car now?
Behind the house. You let them screw you, the car had an accident before.
How stupid do you think we are?
What do you want?
And the fake money? I die you.
What?
The fake money, asshole!
I don't know about fake money.
You paid us with fake money. Can you imagine the problems we had,
when we tried to exchange the money into crowns?
Shall we follow them?
Nahh
We keep observing the house.
What did you do with it?
I spent quite some money on it. Only the chassis was 3 grant.
Thanks for giving me the money back. I'll go on holiday now.
Seeya
Shit
Those bastards.
To the airport. Ackerstraße 42. How long do I have to wait?
OK, hurry.
Hey it's Melanie. I'm out of the country for some weeks. Don't know when I'll be back.
If it's urgent leave me a message.
Come on, the flight is in 2 hours.
They rip off me, we rip off somebody else. It's a circle, get it?
Pick up moron.
Where the hell are you? Stupid jerk.
Am I not talking to my son?
This is Kampmann. Who's there?
This is Flanders.
Flanders you rat. How did you get my sons' mobile?
The idiot must have dropped it into the newspapers.
Listen asshole, where is the key?
Key?
Don't fool me. You know exactely what key I'm talking about.
It's me, Cake. Are you home?
What do you want?
You still have your car?
Get lost.
I talked to Kampmann. I gotta tell you this. Open up.
Sorry about before. Open up.
Are you nuts? What are you doing there in the middle of the night?
Didn't you order a taxi to the airport?
What? wait.
I'm right out.
And if the key was still in the safe deposit box?
No way. I searched it, the police searched it...there was no key in there.
Stay calm, we just talk.
I take care of this. What did you do with Schlucke?
I didn't do anything.
Stop bullshitting me, alright?
I beat the shit out of him.
Stay calm Andy.
You took the key. Then you killed Schlucke and put him in my trunk to get me being balmed for it.
Wait wait, I didn't kill anybody, it was an accident.
Stop bullshiting us, bastard!
It's true, it really was an accident. He took something off the box. I found him searching.
What are you looking for?
Nothing.
You just took something off there.
Nooo
Let's check out the viccinity.
stop there.
You just took something off the box.
Show me your hands.
Nothing, stupid shit here. I go home.
Sorry for putting him in your trunk. That was stupid. But I couldn't let him lie there on the street.
If the key is not with Schlucke, I'll bring the cops here tomorrow and be both go to jail. Got that?
Yes, got it.
There is nothing here.
Did you check all his pockets?
This thing doesn't even have pockets.
Impossible. Here hold the lamp.
I told you he lied to us.
He said Schlucke choked to death.
He killed him.
Wait. Schlucke took something off the box.
What are you looking for?
Nothing.
You just took something out.
Nooo
Let's check out the viccinity.
stop there.
You just took something off the box.
Show me your hands.
Nothing, stupid shit here. I go home.
Ohh you will show me your hands, buddy.
In panic he tried to swallow the key, and choked to death on it. There is something hard here.
You're sick.
The key is in his windpipe. He have to cut him open.
Forget it. You're a pervert.
Andy, the key is in there. Kampmann is willing to pay 100.000 for that key.
Even if the fat pig pais a million. We digg Schlucke back in now.
Listen, I'm in trouble. I need that money.
Come on, those few tax repaiments. 
I never won any money on horse bets.
What did you life of all this time?
4 years ago I emptied a Bank with Kalle Grabowski.
Emptied?
Robbed! Kalle got busted. That idiot bought a Mercedes one week later.
Officially, at the store. Anyway, they put him away for 5 years.
So me made a deal: He leaves me out of this and gets 90% of the money later.
But he escaped 2 days ago.
Exactely. But I lost his money on horse gambling.
How long do I know you?
What?
We knew each other for almost 20 years. Why did you never mention the robbery?
Andy, in that business you better don't talk. Or else you end up like this guy here.
I'm your friend, you think I would have turned you in or what?
I'm not really proud about what I've done.
The rest is your job.
What do you think will be in the box?
Who cares as long as it's woth a lot of money.
There you are, asshole.
If you shoot him you have to shoot me too.
Alright.
Then you'll never know where your money is.
Why does he know about that?
We're just getting yor money from the safe deposit. Cake has the key.
Carfull.
To the deposit boxes. - You go ahead.
4997, that's it.
Open.
Take it out.
Open!
It's alright. We're policemen.
Is he dead?
Yes
He's had it.
This area is sealed off.
what happened here?
None of your business. Hey, pretty girls, can I help you?
Where is gate A?
You have to go around. They just shot one guy, so there is no way through here now.
Is there a bathroom somewhere?
Over there on the left, honey.
At least he lead us to his money.
That's my money. They want to take my money.
Andy, you bastard. You were like a son to me but now you're going to jail with me.
Open the bag. That's my money. Arrest them.
Well open the bag then.
We just wanted to go on a trip.
My reading entertainment for the way.
Of course Schlucke, it's a bulletproove job.
It'll be easy for you.
Let's go get wasted.
You sure you don't need to check closer? Maybe I have a kalasznikov somewhere.
It's said to be 30° in Palma.
Ironic destiny. The money will rotten away as unnoticed as Schlucke himself.
A pitty.
Dude, forget the dream of getting rich quickly. We should be glad that we got out of everything so well.
You know what? Some people dream their whole life, untill they wake up one day
And realize that they can't remember their dream.
