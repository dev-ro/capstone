       What was she doing
         in the forest?
   Henry and maud are coming.
         They're close.
    They think she's afraid
         of the house,
      That she jumped out
    of the window to escape.
       Neve, do you hear?
    Your parents are coming.
        Oh, god, lucas,
       look at her mouth!
         Jesus christ!

        Was it the dog?
        [lucas] neve...
      Neve, what happened?
      [nat] ryan and lucy,
     go back upstairs, now!
     [lucas] she's covered
   in scratches and bruises.
     She must have fallen,
      Either with the dog
          or earlier.
         [neve crying]

You could have killed yourself.

        Look who's here!
      - [baby vocalizing]
          - sit down.
   - Would you like some tea?
         - Yes, please.
        [lucas] please.
          How are you?
       Not too shaken up?
    She looked so terrified.
         That wound...
  I don't know what to think.
      I'm gonna ask advice
    from a friend in galway,
        Who's a shrink.
          Hiya, neve.
        How you feeling?
            We came
      to see how you are.
        Say hello, neve.
         You've got to

           Two years

           I'm sorry
     we couldn't be there.
             [sigh]
    I know mary loved henry.
  He was her favorite doctor.
         [fly buzzing]
    [crows caw in distance]
          [heavy sigh]
       [baby vocalizing]
      I just hope she soon
    settles into the house.
       A shelf fell down
           yesterday.
   It was my fault, I didn't
   put it up properly, but...
    She thinks things move.
       The house creaks,
          it's normal.
 She's forgotten what it's like
     living in the country.
  But, if she doesn't settle,
    then we'll have to move.
        Even if it means
     going back into town.
   After only one month now,
      it's a bit of shame,
         But, still...
    And we're gonna have to
    do her bedroom up again.
   Let her choose everything
           this time.
          Maybe she'll
       feel better then.
 And I've cut the branches down
      outside her window.
   They were casting shadows
         over the wall.
    We had to do that, too,
         for our kids.
They were scared stiff by them.
         [baby crying]
    And leave a night light
          on for her.
   Oh, we bought one of those
         this morning.
        Do you not miss
        living in town?
      With your high class
           patients?
         No, I'm fed up
         with all that.
 Besides, the country's better
         for the kids.
        [baby babbling]
      That's enough, neve.
        Leave him alone.
         How many times
   have we told you, dammit!
           I'm sorry.
         Neve is still
  very jealous of her brother.
   But children don't always
realize how violent they can be.
        [baby vocalizes]
  You're still a little tired,
          sweetheart.
  Go upstairs and have a rest,
 and I'll come up and see you.

              Hmm?
        It's- it's okay.
         It's gone now.

  The cupboard protected them.
 She was squeezing him so hard,
     could she... Have...?
         Maybe, but...
  I don't think she would have
       had the strength.
          [struggling]
       She's saying that
     the house went crazy.
  I mean, even if she doesn't
    remember the attackers,
        We're gonna try
       and keep her here
   During the investigation.
      I'm not sure where,
            exactly.
  And it's going to take time
   to find her a foster home.
        We can take her.
        Yes, of course.
           Of course.
     It might take a while.
   It would be better for her
    To start back at school
       at start of term,
  So she doesn't fall behind.
        We can keep her
   for as long as she needs.
     We have a spare room.
        Well, okay then.
      Just the time being.
       It'll help me out.
     It's very kind of you.
If there's anything you notice,
        you let us know.
          I better go.
         I didn't have
      her medical records.
      I suppose her father
       looked after her.
  All those marks and scars...
     She had a bad accident
      When she lived here
      when she was little.
 She was a bit of a daredevil.
   She must not have changed.
 Last week, she cut her tongue
      escaping her house.
     Last night, was she...
     Was she hit or abused
          in any way?
  I'm not allowed to tell you.
    She's had a shock, so...
       Don't be surprised

        You know, neve,
  you really must have a wash.
   I've left towels and soap
         in your room,
 But you haven't touched them.
    It's been too long now,
            really.
   It can't go on like this.

        They've nothing.
      Nothing whatsoever,

        I know you spoke
     to joseph today, neve,
  Down at the police station.
       He came to school.
       He wants to punish
        those bad people
  Who did all that nasty stuff
         at your house.
         So that's why
       he's persevering.
       You do understand?
    And also, so it doesn't
         happen again.
     I've already said it.
        It's the house.
          We can call
  your father's sister later.
       The one who lives
         in the states.
       Wouldn't you like
  to see her, or speak to her?
         It's my belt.
    One of the trouser loops
           is broken,
          And the belt
        keeps rising up.
           It itches.
       Someone at school
  thought you were my sister,
     That you'd come back.
         [lucas]: Ryan!
      My dead sister mary.
        You were friends
     when you were little.
           Your daddy
        was her doctor.
        She had cancer.
            [thwap]
      Fee, fie, foe, fum!
      Finished, finished,

         Lucy, please.
      Hey, give that back!
        - Give it back!
             - Hey!
         That's enough.
       If you're not back
          at the table
By the time I've counted to ten,
 you're going straight to bed.
             One...
             Two...
  Nat, we're all out of beer.
            Three...

     [nat]: I'll get some.
         Ryan and lucy,
  come help me pick a bottle.
      - Yaay! The cellar!
         - The cellar!
       - I'm not scared.
    - You're a scaredy cat.
         - No, you are.
    - No, I'm not. You are.
       Ryan, no running.
        We used to have
another little girl, but, em...
          ...She died.
    We didn't say anything,
      Because it happened
        a long time ago.
          That's all.
     And we didn't want it
         to upset you.

         Have you seen
        what she's done?
       It's not the same
       for ryan and lucy.
       They were bumping
        into everything.
          And scared.
     They hurt themselves.
           But her...
        - Why did she...
     - I don't know, lucas.
 Don't you think she got scared
      by all the screaming
 And the noises in the cellar?
     Maybe it reminded her
         of that night.
 I went into her room just now,
     and she was so scared,
      As if I was gonna...
 You've got to speak with tanya
         straight away.
     - This is not normal!
           - Lucas...
    We can't give up on her
      At the first problem
         we encounter.
      She is traumatized.

   Neve says she hasn't seen
        peter or emily.
      They've disappeared.
     Couldn't get anything
          out of her.
    It's just a coincidence.
         I'm not sure.
     There are fingerprints
      of several children
      All over the house,
  and neve's are amongst them.
   It doesn't prove anything.
    She could have left them
         there anytime.
   [birds chirping, outside]
             What?
       What do you think
         neve has done?
     You think she murdered
       an entire family?
   Nobody's saying that, nat.
     But the circumstances
        Surrounding both
         murder scenes
       Are very similar.
        And she ran away
        from your house
  Just when it was happening.
              So?
    She can't even remember
    who killed her parents.
         I don't know,
     that's what she says.
    Children are very easily
          influenced.
       And these people,
            these...
        ...Murderers...
     Maybe she knows them.
    Or maybe she's listening
     to what they tell her.
           I just...
        I- I don't know.
             What?
            Lucas...
         Say something!
Maybe it's best just to keep her
  out of the way for a while.
   Everyone knows everyone's
     business around here.
   People are superstitious.
      They're gonna start
       imagining things.
        No, she must go
   back to school as normal.
      You must tell people
    to stop talking rubbish.
     And I'll do the same.
   She'll never get over this
      if nobody helps her.
   What about your daughter?
  She's the same age as neve,
           isn't she?
  And she has a birthday party
           next week,
    You should invite neve.
 It would suit you to keep her
        cooped up here,
     But henry helped your
 little girl when she was tiny.
   People protect themselves.
    They protect their kids.
          That's all.
  No one's going to leave you
    in the lurch, nat, okay?
     I'll come by tomorrow.
       But I'm asking you
        to do one thing.
      Keep an eye on her.
   She mustn't go out alone,
      or sleep by herself.
       We can't find her
     wandering the streets.

    To anne's birthday party
          on Saturday.
         That's great.
      I bet you will have
          lots of fun.
           [giggles]
 I used to have little parties
       when I was young.
           [chuckles]
    Well, I already told you
about the one with the big dog.
     But there were others.
           [chuckles]
       [cringes slightly]

              Hey.
         [door closes]
  You already know each other,
           don't you?
    But maybe you don't know
      That matthew collins
      is my baby's daddy.
      [school bell rings]
            [sighs]
     Well, there are a lot
 of unanswered questions here.
  She was assaulted that night
 the first murders took place.
      Maybe by that gang.
       Ah, I don't know.
  I'm wondering if it doesn't
       go further back...
   ...If it's not her parents
 that abused her that night...
      ...And even before.
   She's got all the symptoms
      of an abused child.
          And look at
  peter and emily's mother...
            [sighs]
  it's a strange coincidence.
       Try to think about
  something else for a while.
     For our sakes, and the
            baby's.
   I'll come and pick you up
         after school.
             Okay?
       I better get gone.
         See you later.
      [sizzling on stove]
            [lucas]
     how was school today?
          They told us
     about peter and emily,
       And their mother.
       They said we must
     always stay together,
        And tell someone
     if we see a stranger.
         We mustn't go
        into the forest.
   Don't' worry, sweetheart,
   it won't be for too long.
             Here.
        You haven't had
    too many sweeties today.
             Here.
  I'm gonna read you a story,
     and then it's bedtime.
             [lucy]
      story about murders?
    I think not, sweetheart.
         Would you like
         anything else?
      I'm going to my room
            to read.
          Oh, neve...
     [uncomfortable grunt]
     Stop pushing me away.
       We'll never get on
   If you keep on treating us
        like your enemy.
Neve, my sweet little kitten...
    You can read downstairs,
            with us.
        I know it seems
       like a nightmare,
  But one day it'll be better,
          you'll see.
           Trust us.
        [neve screaming]
     Stop it, neve, please!
      You're gonna wake up
         ryan and lucy.
It's just for tonight, we can't
   let you sleep on your own.
        Wandering around
        the countryside
    Alone at night like that
         is dangerous.
          [hollering]
             - shh.

            Neve...
           I'm sorry.
     I'm sorry, sweetheart.
       I just wanted you
       to stop screaming,
     And come to bed, I...
       I just wanted you
       to be a good girl.
           No, no no.
 No, neve, what are you doing?
             Nat...
   She'll sleep in her room,
    but I'll stay with her.
    It's just for one night.
    Can block up her window
           tomorrow.
       Come along, neve.
         [door closes]
      Go to sleep, please.
           It's late.
          [whistling]

        are you doing?!
       [undulating hum ¶]
      Who gave you these?
        I got them from
     the album downstairs.
          I like them.
   What gives you the right?
   Who do you think you are?!
        These are ours,
       they're not yours!
          I forbid you
         to touch them!
  Lucas, have you gone crazy?
        She took those,
   she was playing with them.
         [ryan and lucy
    crying in the next room]
     [crying out together]
             daddy!
        You go to them,
        I'll stay here.
             Daddy!
      Neve, why would you
          take these?
    This is our little girl,
             mary.
     The one who got sick,
      do you remember her?
    Why would you show them
           to lucas?
        It hurts us, we-
     we loved her so much.
     Then why is she dead?
          But neve...
     That wasn't our fault.
     She was seriously ill.
       There was nothing
          we could do.
   And that had nothing to do
      with her being ill.
  Try and get some sleep now.

     Hi, my name is olivia.
            Welcome.
    Neve, the other children
       are in the garden.
           Join them.
             Look.
      [indistinct chatter]
    She's the prettiest doll
          in the shop.
        Do you like her?
   Anne loves dolly parties.
     Have you heard of them
            before?
         [child laughs]
              No.
     I- I want to go home.
        I don't want it.
 Ah, we- we can't go home now,
          sweetheart.
   That wouldn't be very nice
           for anne.
  Anyway, I'm sure you'll play
     lots of other things,
     And there'll be cake,
      and presents, and...
    I think colette has even
   organized a treasure hunt.
   I'll be right here, okay?
            - Hello.
        - [together] hi!
    Are you coming to play?
    Have fun and be careful.
        Give me a shout
      when you're hungry.
      [indistinct chatter]
         [little girl]
       ...So disgusting.
       Don't do it again.
        They sound like
      they're having fun.
    Yeah, it was a good idea
           of yours.
     I'm so glad she came.

         She's lovely.
    I don't like the dress.
           It's pink.
       It should be blue.
       On second though,
     she's not very lovely.
          Is she bold?
   Do you have to punish her?
  Mine's crazy, I have to look
              out.
         Awake, asleep.

     Well, they're talking
       a load of rubbish.
   Well, we left lit candles
         on the table.
      It's our own fault.
     What do you think neve
    is actually capable of?
        Well, what else
      could it have been?
        No, I don't want
         to call lucas.
   I want to find her myself.
