I think about nothing.
I like the ball.
I'm in love with the ball.
As round as my girlfriend's ass.
Only the ball is
and the gate.
Lead the ball,
I run with it towards the goal,
and shoot into the goal.
I can feel the sun.
I can feel the green grass.
I can feel the jersey on my body
and the shoes on my feet.
I can feel it in the air and the wind.
I concentrate all my senses.
Football is my life.
I breathe football.
Playing football is what I want.
I know who I am.
I think only about football.
because nothing else exist.
Who do I talk to?
Who do I talk to? Hello?
Hey, who do I talk to there?
Look into my eyes! Look at me!
Bring back the ball, come on!
Move it, boy!
One or two! Do not go to sleep!
Come here, look, I get it!
Show something, come on!
Come on, do it!
Damn, do not you move on,
like a little girl!
Sissy! That's better,
come on! Little girl!
Come on! Again!
You are more valuable
than all the others combined.
Why am I so hard on you.
You need to work hard! Even much harder!
Believe me, you'll be thankful later.
Tomorrow is the biggest day of my life.
I am gonna score
the biggest score of my life.
Because I know that I have it in me.
and that is in the world.
Tomorrow I will hook, but three times.
- For real?
- Absolutely!
If I score three times,
then fuck everything.
Don't be a baby.
Don't be a baby.
Every one does it, even Mac Donald
does it. Why do you act like a baby.
Fuck off!
So, what is it? Shitting in your pants?
Come on, come on! Move it!
Stop combing your hair while playing!
Closer!
Shit!
Here!
Conflict! Come closer! Stay on tight!
There was nothing!
Are you kidding or what?!
Szabi, do you speak German?
How you played? How directed the team?
This was a bunch of crap on the field.
You said to collide with them!
You are bad! And anyone can do that on any street
corner. The point went to Dortmund, you know why?
Not because of the damn red card.
But rather because you
forget how to play.
What?
You find me so beautiful?
We are going to fall.
And?
You can't score a goal.
What did you say?
Are you deaf?
Don't touch me!
That's what you want, uh?
You want it?
Attention! Air Berlin No.6932, Budapest-bound flight
passengers please take their places at the gate A17.
Attention! Passengers
of the Air Berlin No.6932 ...
Does it still hurt?
Will you call the cops now?
You think I should?
You want to live here?
Yes.
I inherited the house,
but someone broke in and devastated it.
I'm sure it is going to rain soon.
It already does.
Very complex, it shouldn't be,
the bricks must be refreshed.
You took your time...
Your girlfriend?
Yeah, something like that.
No wait!
This one was good
You should only throw the broken ones.
Put the good on the side. Here.
No, this is just rubbish.
Yes, this too.
Pull it out. That too.
Same.
You put that aside, this one.
- That's it for today.
- Why?
Because we can continue tomorrow,
a storm is coming.
I though you came to work.
And? I haven't been working?
Will you give me my money for today?
They are wet.
You have not properly covered them.
Now we have to wait
until they are dry again.
You said I had to cover them.
That's what I did.
You should better put them inside. I'll
come back tomorrow when they'll be dry.
You don't give a shit, or what?
You have never done
something like this before.
Then show me how it's done.
Hey? Can you hear me?
The shit caved in over me.
Get up.
Better?
- Yes.
- You want some water?
Get schnapps, damn it.
Beer...
Come in!
No way. It's cold.
Bullshit. It's great.
- Get off my back.
- Give me the bottle.
- What the fuck? I can't swim!
- Stay still!
Wait, I hold you.
Relax yourself.
Lie on the water!
Still alive?
Why are you afraid of me?
You could have come home.
You know you can tell me everything.
It would have been fine.
Here, eat.
I clean your room tomorrow.
You can sleep with me tonight, ok?
Watch out!
Again! More rythme!
Carefull, now...
Go, go!
I'll buy you a ticket tonight.
Tomorrow you'll already be there.
I won't go back.
What?
I'm tired of football.
How come?
- Do you know when I stopped?
- Yes dad, I know.
Ah, son...
You know, how many
times I wanted to quit?
But it's not possible. It's your life.
Not my life.
Excuse me?
I don't know, dad.
I'll be a beekeeper.
A beekeeper...
On Grandpa's farm.
Grandpa's farm?
Yes.
Do you know what you're talking about?
Look at me.
Do you hear me?
Look at me when I talk to you.
You hear me?! Look at me!
You're gonna hit me, son?
Fool.
Tomorrow I'll call your coach.
I'll ask if he wants you back.
- And don't thank me.
- Absolutely not.
Dad!
Dad, are you here?
- The Lord be with you.
- And with your spirit.
- We raise our hearts!
- We raise them to the Lord!
Let and give thanks
to the Lord, our God.
This is worthy and right.
It is our duty and, in fact,
our duty and our salvation,
to praise you, Lord, at all times,
but especially now at Easter time,
because Christ, the Easter lamb,
for us was a victim.
The past is wiped out.
The corrupt world rises to a new life.
And we lead our lives
back through Christ.
Therefore Easter joy
spreads all over the world,
The Earth loop rejoices.
The heavenly powers and mighty angel
sing the praise of your glory...
Are you Hungarian?
- Hey, you can speak Hungarian?
- Yes.
Aron worked for you?
- You pay him properly?
- Yes, why? What did he tell you?
Then drink up!
Give some to Aron.
In the forest, where I went for a walk,
I saw a nosegay bloom.
Before it fades...
- ...I beg to pour it.
- You can.
Thank you.
No, no!
Happy Easter!
No!
Now are you awake, sister?
Give me a kiss.
Happy Easter!
Let's drink.
Mum.
Hm? Tell me?
I had an argument with Szabi.
Why?
He groped me.
What do mean by "he groped me"?
He just groped me.
And I let him do.
I don't know why.
I let him have his way.
I could not do anything.
Why haven't you left?
I don't know.
I don't know why I haven't.
Go, go, go!
Over here, good!
Me!
- Quick, over here.
- Yes!
Come on! Give it!
Fuck!
- Fuck, what are you doing?
- Stay here.
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Why are you defending him?
Are you together?
Stay down!
What are you waiting for?! Come!
Hello Bernard.
I just wanted to talk to you.
I am in a house
in the middle of nowhere.
Completely alone.
There is nothing here. It's dark...
...and silent.
Fucking quiet.
And the neighbor's dog 
wakes me up at night.
Maybe it was all nonsense,
and I should not have come here.
Take care of yourself!
Hello.
Aron isn't home.
Where is he?
I don't know, he haven't told me.
Don't come here anymore.
Let him be.
We are not like you.
Aron is not like you.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm starting the beekeeping.
Good for you.
I want to do it with you.
Do it alone. I don't know how it works 
and I don't have time for it.
What is it? You don't work?
But where?
It's a bit cold, but don't worry, 
if you want it, I can make it warmer.
No need.
It's good, but having
a bathroom won't hurt.
What are you doing during the day?
I fix the house.
Ah yeah, looks like.
And I take care of the bees.
What?
Come, I'll show you.
Forgive me for what
happened in the shower.
I was an asshole.
That's right.
But you don't need to apologize.
I was looking at you.
From the begining.
But you don't say anything.
Tell me something...
What's the matter?
I can't.
I think we shouldn't work
for a couple of days.
I want to show Bernard the region.
What's wrong?
Nothing, I just take away
the construction timbers.
- Why did that guy come here?
- No reason.
To visit me.
And what can he do here?
- What do you mean?
- Do you pay him too,
or is it for free?
- What do you want?
- Is Brigi home?
Not for you.
Come, let's talk a bit.
If you two are together, 
it's not my business.
But she cried the whole evening.
I don't want to see again,
that my sister is crying
in her sleep because of you.
Understood?
- Understood.
- Good.
- Then you stop it okay?
- Okay.
Wait...
What are you doing
constantly with that boy?
I work for him.
You need money,
and he got some.
Therefore you make more.
He pays you for it, or not?
You're sick.
I can't accept this.
This is also not welded.
I won't look at this.
You know yourself that
you have failed, don't you?
This is not welded neatly.
Failed.
Same.
Keep your mouth open.
Mouth open, or I'll burn you.
Calm down.
I won't burn you.
Mom, you won't get ill?
Just stop crying.
Someone did something to my son.
I did it on my own, it's my fault.
You told him?
How can you say that?
I haven't told anyone.
But you did.
Don't lie, you had it trumpeted.
Mom...
Look at me.
Look me in the eyes,
and tell me it's wrong.
It's a sin. What you're
doing is disgusting.
But to carry you around and to do 
everything for you, I'm good enough?
I can take care of myself.
Then do that.
Who is it?
I don't know...
I'll take a look.
- Who's there?
- Who is it?
Why didn't you tell
me anything about it?
Why did you tell me to come here?
Just so I leave.
I can go back.
I never said that you had to come.
You love him?
I don't know.
Are you coming back?
So you can beat me?
I can't leave him alone.
I have to go back soon,
otherwise you really get fired.
Are you coming?
I have to talk about this now?
Anyway, you come with me or not?
What is it?
Are you deaf, Szabi?
I play just because
my dad was playing soccer.
He was right.
You could play in the best teams.
I'm not going to beg to get back.
You should.
You have place there, not here.
Szabi, are you coming?!
- I found something!
- Come on, man!
It's cold!
You've convinced him
to get back with you, right?
What? You don't understand me?
I don't get what you are saying.
Oh, you're so strong!
Let go!
Szabi!
Szabi!
Come on, let's go!
What?
Let's go! Just the two of us.
Leave him here.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Come with me.
You must decide!
Decide now!
I've had enough of this.
I can't leave him here.
Stand up! Stand up!
Faster!
That's it, son.
Dad, I'll stay here.
I will live here.
With him.
Aron? Is that you?
You hear me, kid?
Do you hear me?
Mom!
"Lamb of God,
"you take away the sins of the world,
"have mercy on us.
"Lam of God,
"you take away the sins of the world,
"set us free."
See the Lamb of God,
who takes away the sins of the world.
Lord, I am not worthy that
you should enter under my roof,
but only say the word and
my soul will be healed.
Soon you'll get it in the ass.
Want a ride?
Aron!
Why did you show up there today?
Why? Are you ashamed of me?
Yes.
I am like this because of you.
The whole thing sucks.
I stayed because of you.
But if you want, I can leave.
I won't ever see you.
