[geese honking] [stirring orchestral music]
-[geese honking]
-Whoo-hoo!
Hey, Larry!
Hello, Peng.
[Peng] Oh, oh! Sorry, Larry.
-[Peng] Whoo-hoo!
-[goose gasps]
-Later, guys.
-That was a violation!
[Peng laughing]
[geese quacking and gasping]
Sorry, guys. I'm running late.
Goose on the loose.
-[quacking]
-[man yelps]
There will be geese to the right,
left, up, and down.
Please check before you answer
nature's call, or at least give a honk.
-[goose farts]
-[another screams]
Jenkins! You should have gone
before we left.
-Ew! As I was saying--
[yelps]
[shouts] Peng, you're late. Again!
That makes you a weak link.
I've got no use for a loose goose.
Not in my flock.
[Bing] Now, statistically speaking,
you're not likely to die in the air.
This is a motivational speech?
There's a thousand other ways
you can get into trouble.
-Get just one feather out of place...
-[goose yelps]
...and you could be staring
at your poop deck from the inside out.
-That's why we train.
-[all] Train, train, and train again.
Birds of a feather, migrate together.
[all] Birds of a feather,
migrate together.
Question.
My friend here, Crazy-Eye, wants to know,
do we have to migrate in a V formation?
-Excuse me?
-Couldn't we try another letter?
Yeah, like maybe a W?
[geese] All together, all right?
[grumbles]
Peng, don't make me turn this V around. Now, in answer to your question,
over many generations,
the V formation has
aerodynamically proven to be--
-[goose] What about an A?
-What? No!
Well, technically,
that's just an inverted V. Right, Bing?
You... We fly... in a V.
-Birds of a feather, migrate together.
-[geese yelping and gasping]
-Birds of a feather, migrate together.
-Now, how 'bout a hashtag?
I don't even know what that is! No!
No, no, no, no, no!
It has to be a V.
Now. Birds of a feather, migrate together.
[Bing shouts] I said, "Birds of a feather,
migrate together..." [groans]
Where is everybody?
Follow me!
-[geese quacking]
-Woooooooow!
-Yeaaaaaaah!

[mouse squeaks]
-Come on, hurry.
-Chi,
if I don't eat something,
I'm gonna die... to death.
Come on, bro,
you ate like five minutes ago.
You know we're not supposed
to leave the road. Chao, come back here!
-Oh, look at that. Breakfast!
-No! No caterpillars.
You'll be barfing up chunks
if you eat that.
-But I'm hungry, Chi.
-You're always hungry.
-There'll be plenty at Pleasant Valley.
-Pleasant Valley, here we come!
[JingJing] And remember, we've got to go
before the snow comes.
Come on!
I can feel the air getting colder. Ow!
-What's going on? What the--?
-Hey, JingJing.
-I hope I'm not holding you up.
-Peng, not today.
Hey, Peng.
What do you say
me and you find some secluded spot
to enjoy the Harvest Moon?
-I made the moon for you, you know?
-You made the moon for me? Yeah, right. We're leaving
for the Haven tonight.
Remember?
Listen, my father would kill me if I--
Funny. I didn't know chickens could fly.
[chuckles] Are you calling me chicken?
-[Peng imitating chicken]
-Oh, you want to race?
-[Peng laughs]
-It's on!
♪ I'm on my way to Paradise ♪
-[both laughing]
-Hey, move it.
Wow. That's a goose.
On your left.
Move over.
Mwah! Got ya!
Hey, no fair.
-[Peng] Wooooooo!
-[JingJing laughs]
Wait, I need another one.
I must be crazy. What is it about you?
Well, I'm good-looking.
And charming. And...
Woohoooooo!
I'm the best flyer in the flock.
Best flyer in the flock, huh?
[screaming]
Hey! Whoa!
Look out!
-[ducks squawking]
-[Peng groans]
No!
Oww!
-[thumps]
-[gurgling]
[Larry] Hey, take it easy, son.
I just had a new roof put on.
[Giles and Niles] Ow!
-I told you you were too heavy.
-Me? Oh, I like that.
Who was it who gorged themselves
on all those frogs this morning?
-[Giles] How dare you!
-See? He's got us attacking each other.
Your misguided landing
made me lose a leg.
One of a pair. You see this?
My leg has gone.
-Completely gone.
-No, no, wait.
-[laughing] Silly me.
-[sighs]
Nonetheless,
my colleague and I are here
in our official capacity
as representatives of the lake.
A family-friendly community.
Yeah? So, what's the problem?
[Larry] Yeah. So, what's the problem?
-The problem?
-The problem...
...is that you are not family-friendly.
[both grunting]
-Ow, ow!
-Ow!
-[Peng laughs]
-Come along, Giles.
-[splatters]
-Poo bombs!
Oh, no. Just had my feathers done
this morning.
Peng! Dad's really mad and--
Your dad's always mad.
How about another kiss? Come here...
-[Peng honks]
-[grunts]
-Hi, Dad.
-How's it going, peaches?
-Hey! What were you thinking?
-Ow, ow! Ow!
-He's sorry, Dad.
-Ow. Sorry?
Jeez. Relax. No one got hurt.
It was just a little fun.
Migration isn't about fun.
It's about covering your tail feathers
in case something comes up from behind.
Now that was fun. Everybody?
See that feather?
It's moving north to south, like the wind.
What does that tell you?
Winter's coming early.
Bing! Smart girl.
And in case some of us have forgotten,
this is why we migrate.
To stay ahead of the snow
and to get to the thermal pools
before we all wind up in the frozen aisle
with our giblets in a bag,
stuffed up our communal hoo-ha.
[all] Hoo-ha!
It can be uncomfortable.
We fly at sunset. I need
all responsible flyers front and center.
You know who you are.
This is not a drill.
[groans]
Not you.
I'm giving you one more chance to grow up.
Show you belong to this flock.
Lead the junior flyers to the Haven.
Hey, Peng. Peng! Over here!
-[young geese chattering]
-Are you kidding? Hey, guys.
I can't fly with the kids. [laughs]
-They're childish. Not gonna do it.
-Listen, Mr. Fun.
Maybe the juniors can teach you
a thing or two about teamwork.
Teamwork?
Flying with the kids.
Can you believe that? Me?
They're so slow,
it'll be like flying backwards.
The best flyer
in the flock wouldn't think twice.
Exactly. Even if I leave tomorrow,
I would get there before you.
That's because you're flying by yourself.
Anyone can do that.
-Sticking together, that's what's harder.
-[groans]
Yeah. I agree with you, but come on.
-I mean, the juniors?
-[groans]
Honk if you need me, Peng.
Otherwise, see ya when I see ya.
I buried treasure, it's in the...
[groans]
[sinister purring]
[grunting]
-Wait, guys! Guys...
-Chao!
...wait for us!
Shh! Look.
[purring]
Two little orphans all alone
in a big, wide world.
So vulnerable, so sad, so... delicious.
[changes voice] They're sitting ducks.
Let's eat them now.
Patience. It'll be dark soon.
-[snarls] Grrrrrrr!
-[Peng sighs]
Peng, it's migration day.
Why don't you leave with the others?
-[frog croaking]
-I'll go tomorrow, Larry.
I can't wait to see their faces,
when I'm waiting for them
at the waypoint.
Son, if you live your life
like it's always a race,
chances are,
you'll get exactly what you want.
-See, that's what I'm saying.
-[Larry groans]
What I meant was,
you'll pass everyone by
and wind up with yourself.
No one else.
All I know, Larry, is life is a race,
-and nobody wants to be a loser.
-Mhm.
Did I ever tell you
about the turtle and the rabbit?
Well, now, see...
A cousin of mine decided
to race a jackrabbit.
Everyone told him, "You're crazy.
A turtle ain't built for speed."
But he went ahead anyway.
And, you know,
the darnedest thing happened.
-[croaks]
-Just going to spitball here...
Um...
The turtle got to the finish line first.
Nope. Never saw him again. [chuckles]
Crazy varmint had no sense of direction.
[both laughing]
-That's a good one, Larry.
-Peng!
Whoa! Whee!
-I am not a frog.
-Sorry, Larry.
-You okay?
-I'm all right.
Feel fine. Cleared my sinuses.
"Wind up with yourself."
[scoffs]
Like I'm gonna take advice
from a talking rock.
[croaking]
Just to recap, flock.
This is not a drill.
The chances of fatality at this point
are exceptionally slim.
Only one in five of us are likely to die.
Aah!
Excellent form, recruits.
Just like a V. Keep calm, keep the V.
All right, flock. Keep it loose.
Fly like a goose. [laughs]
-I'm kidding. Keep the V.
-Sorry I'm late.
JingJing, I was really worried
about you for a second there.
Sorry, Dad. I really tried
to talk some sense into Peng.
Sense into Peng?
Be easier to train a frog to fly. [laughs]
-[fluttering]
-No offense, Chauncy.

-What the--?
-Hey!
Ew! Urgh!
-Beat it, weirdos.
-I must be shell-shocked.
Are those your kids?
Yeah. Sure, Larry. I'm their mom.
-You're our mom?
-What?
-No.
-I knew it!
[Chao] Oh, Mommy, I love you so much.
-No, no, no!
-I've always wanted a mom just like you.
-Please, no.
-Well, well, well.
Please, just get back here.
-Peng, I had no idea you were expecting.
-What?
Congratulations, Mother Goose.
-Look at me. Do I look like a mommy?
-[Chi] I'm sorry. He hasn't imprinted yet,
so he thinks that anyone
with feathers could be our mom.
Imprinted? He's imprinting on my leg?
Do you understand that that's disgusting?
Gross. Ew. This is...
-I'm out of here.
-Please, wait.
-What?
-I'm Chi.
And this is my little brother, Chao.
-We got separated from our flock and we--
-Here's the thing. I'm not his mommy,
and I'm not your babysitter.
Baby? I am not a baby.
For your information, I am 16 days old.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know you were so ancient.
Ow! Seriously, stop that. My butt! Stop--
-Hey, quit it. Ow!
-[Chi] Chao, stop it! Okay?
-Please, just get off--
-[gasps] Just wait!
[breathes deeply]
You crashed into our flock,
and that is child endangerment.
-Which makes you responsible.
-What?
[screams]
The only thing in danger around here,
is me getting plucked alive.
-Look. Can you help us or not?
-I would say I'm an "or not."
Absolutely not.
I want nothing to do with you
and the baby piranha.
-I got a flight to catch.
-You are a dirty pile of jerk feathers.
Jerk feathers? That's an insult?
[gasps]
What the--?
Would you just get off me, you loony?
-[Chao gasps]
-Oh, no. [thumps on gong]
-[groans]
-[gong crashes]

[laughs]
What a day.
At least I know it can't get any worse.
[gong clangs loudly]
-[wing crunches]
-[Peng yells with pain]
Okay. Don't panic, Peng.
-It might not be that bad.
-[wing cracking]
[yelps loudly]
Okay, Peng.
Here we go. Come on. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!
[screams]
[Larry] You're not doing it.
[Peng pants]
Now, isn't this interesting?
Frazier, it seems the new mother
is unable to fly.
Yes, indeed, Giles.
I do believe she's a "lame duck."
-"Goose," actually.
-What a terrible thing it is
-to be injured in the wild.
-Oh, yeah. It's deadly, I understand.
Yes, a lone goose could be reduced
to foie gras in mere moments.
That would be quite a show.
Yes, yes. "Dinner and a show."
[both cranes laughing]
Wait! What?
[Peng stammers] Guys, look.
-[loud snap]
-[Giles yelps]
What?
I know I may have been
a little rough at times, but--
-We know what you're up to.
-Yes, we do. What is he up to?
You simply want us around,
so that you're not a sitting duck.
-"Goose."
-Goose! Goose!
All I'm saying is, the three of us...
If we were to walk to the Haven together,
that would be all right? Right?
Walk? On these spindly legs?
Have you gone absolutely mad, sir?
Not only is it dangerous
to travel on foot,
but quite frankly, we would look silly.
[legs creak]
Guys, come on.
You know what's gonna happen to me!
Winter's coming! And...
-Yes, and you'll be a dead duck.
-"Goose," actually.
Goose!
[Larry] I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking,
"If only I had a companion. Some trusty friend to walk with me."
Am I right?
-Thanks, but...
-Hey. I know turtles don't migrate.
My mom said, I'd never go anywhere
unless I stuck my neck out.
Andale, amigo. [humming]
Okay. Think.
Think, Peng. Think!
Wait a minute. What I need is something
that can throw the bad guys off my scent.
An insurance policy. That's...
Oh. I don't need to be faster
than a predator.
I need to be faster than a companion.
[laughs] Or "companions."
[singsong] My good buddies...
Champ? Cho? Hello?
Chang and Chomp?
Where are those stupid ducks?
Oh, hey! There you guys are. [chuckles]
We totally got off on the wrong foot.
I forgive you. Come on. Let's go. -We don't talk to strangers.
-What?
Strangers? But, no... It's me.
Me? Who's me?
It's me, Peng. The good-looking goose?
Nope. We don't know anyone by that name.
Yeah.
Looks like we haven't been introduced.
Look. I'm the one you were calling...
[birds chirping]
...mommy.
Mommy!
-All right. Okay.
-Something doesn't smell right.
-Maybe that's your brother.
-[Chao farts]
What the--?
-Who treats their mother this way?
-Why are you helping us, all of a sudden?
Why? [chuckles] Because I'm doing it
from the bottom of my heart. Okay?
[sighs]
Okay. Fine, fine.
If you don't want my help... off you go.
See if I care, you know?
You wanna be eaten by monsters,
"Chomp, chomp," says the monster.
Chi, he's doing it
from the heart of his bottom.
That's right.
That's just the kind of goose I am.
I've always gone around helping people,
trying to do the right thing.
[whimpers] You know? Maybe help a couple
of ducklings that are lost,
and they just want to find their way back
to their flock.
And maybe put a little piece
of the burden
of the world on my shoulders.
Oh, Mom! Can I ride on your shoulders?
Not a chance. Get off me.
Let's go.
Come on. Let's pick up the pace.
[Chao pants]
Wait! Okay? Would you wait up?
Just because you're helping us,
doesn't make you the boss.
Yes, it does.
And since I'm the boss,
you're gonna have to go by my rules.
I'm just spitballing here,
rule number one:
whatever I say goes.
Goes where?
[sighs]
Okay. You know what? Rule number two:
-no questions about rule number one.
-Okay, Mom.
All right. Rule number three:
don't call me mommy, mom,
mama, mama mia, mother,
anything that starts with "m."
-You got it?
-Got it. Jerk feathers.
-Any more rules?
-Yes.
Rule number four: we walk fast,
there's no whining or complaining,
eyes are front all the time,
and most of all, never, ever, wander off.
-You're so stupid.
-No, you're stupid.
-Stupid infinity.
-You're stupider.
Stupid sounding, stupid, stupid.
You know what?
You're stupid, stupid, stupid,
multiplied by stupid.
-Okay, that's stupid.
-At least I'm not a duck.
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know what it... Where's Chao?
-He wandered off.
-Are you kidding?
[Larry breathes deeply]
I'm making some really good time here.
-[splashing]
-[gasps] What's that?
What the--?
Uh!
It's a monster.
[snarls and splutters]
[coughs]
Didn't you just die?
[burps]
That's disgusting.
I'm a cat, you idiot. I have nine lives.
[laughs] Well, now you got eight.
-[Larry choking]
-Now, then. Down to business.
Where did the goose go?
Peng's my friend.
I'll take that information to the grave.
Okay.
[gasps] Peng hurt his wing,
so he has to walk to the Haven.
He can't fly?
The goose can't fly!
[laughing evilly]
-He's a dead duck.
-"Goose," actually.
Why, this means...
stir the fun sauce, boys,
we're having Peking Goose tonight.
[snarls]
Remember this meeting.
I'm sure I will.
I've got turtle recall.
"Turtle recall," that was a good one.
Why, thank you.
Don't mention it.
-What?
-This isn't good.
I have to warn Peng right away.
Time to kick it into overdrive.
[limbs creak]
[engine revs]
What a show-off.
[huffs and puffs]
[sighs] Jeez. You know,
you didn't have to tie him up.
Listen. I have to catch up with my--
I mean, we have to catch up
with your flock.
And the little funny face,
wandering off all the time,
is slowing me, I mean us, down.
[Chao gasps]
See? Treat him with respect,
he behaves with... What?
In case you have poor vision,
his face is... funny.
[Chao laughs]
[huffs] Come on. Let's go.
Okay. New plan.
New plan?
I didn't know we had an old plan.
What?
We'll cut across country
and join the road further down.
But we'll be going the wrong way. We may be going the wrong way,
but we'll be headed
in the right direction.
What're you saying?
That makes no sense.
[sighs] Look, I'm a migrating goose.
I have excellent instincts,
so from here on out,
we're gonna travel as the crow flies. But, but, but...
-But we can't fly.
-No, no, no.
I mean, as the crow flies.
It's a way of saying...
[shouts] Look. It's just a saying! Okay?
-[Chi clears throat] Hey, Mr. Shortcuts.
-[sighs]
[Chao gasps]
What is it now?
What could possibly be wrong now?
[gasps]
[Chi] Yeah. Rice paddies.
[flock honking]
Okay, flocks. Remember
to fly straight and steady.
Fly into the cloud, not around it.
If you get hit by lightning,
the correct procedure is
to fall out of the sky
while gently smoking.
[flock honking]
Hey, honey, you look
like you've got something on your mind.
-What's going on?
-Sorry, Dad.
-I'm just worried about Peng.
-Ah, JingJing. How can I reassure you?
Don't feel bad
that you couldn't persuade him to come.
He'll hunker down,
and we'll see him next spring.
-For sure.
-Yes, good. You know what? You're right.
-Course, he'll be long dead by then.
-What? Dead?
Mummified skeleton, probably.
-But we'll see him, is the point.
-What?
-If the foxes don't get his bones first.
-Did you just say "foxes"? What?
He'll be fine. He knows what he's doing.
You've no idea what you're doing, do you?
Come on... All right.
Where's your sense of fun? [chuckles]
-It'll be a hop, skip, and a jump.
-Fun. Yeah. Right.
Wait. W-What are you doing?
No. Put me down. Put me down right now.
-Okay. As you wish.
-No, no! No!
-Wait, you're not coming?
-[Peng laughs]
No way. That thing looks dangerous.
[all screaming]
Oh, no! Oh, no!
-[in slow motion] I don't like it.

Hi.
Would it be okay if I, I mean,
these two orphan ducks
stayed in your barn for tonight?
Couple hours. Thanks.
Absolutely not. This is for chickens,
not water foul.

Why not just roll me in breadcrumbs
and serve me for dinner?
Now, you should be comfortable.

Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Goodnight, little ones.

-Piders! I hate piders.
-Now you've done it.

I'm scared.
Why don't you tell him a story?
That usually works.
I... Stories? Why would I...
You tell him one.
[clucks] For goodness' sakes, man!
Tell him something, so we can all sleep.
-[Edna] Stanley! Stop fussing.
-[sighs]
Will you go to sleep if I do this?
Okay. One story coming up.
Once upon a time, there were, um...
there were these...
ducklings. Two. Yeah.
-Two little guys.
-Ooh! Are we the ducklings?
I am not a guy.
-That's not the...
-[Stanley clucks loudly]
It doesn't matter.
One boy, one girl duckling...
were... they were lost...
in the fog.
They were lost in the thick, murky fog,
and it was so dense,
they couldn't see an inch
in front of their faces...
We're never gonna find our way
out of this.
-We'll have to cross the river.
-But that's not safe either. Is it?
Well, it's better than this. Come on.
But, but...
But why did they need to cross the river?
To get to the other side?
No. You know, because...
Because...
-Because if they don't, we'll never--
-Never...
get to sleep. I know.
I have a good mind to show them all who--
[clucks]
-Stanley.
-Yes, darling?
So they started out okay.
I don't want to, Chi. I'm afraid.
Come on. It'll be okay.
But they must have been halfway across
when there was a noise ahead.
A swishing, swirling noise.
Like nothing they'd ever heard before.
[water bubbles]
Galoop. Galoop.
Galoop.
-I don't like it. Let's go back.
-Yeah.
Chi and Chao turned around,
but the mist is even thicker.
There's no going back, and they know it.
[frightened cluck]
Then, the sound again.
Galoop...
The swishing... galoop...
on the still, black water,
is getting closer... galoop... and closer.
Galoop...
And closer! Until...
the terrible, pale, featureless thing
rose slowly up before them and...
-[thunder]
-[Stanley clucks in fear]
[chickens gasp]
-[chicken clucking]
-[Chao starts crying]
-You have zero parenting skills.
-What!
But you guys told me...
How was I supposed
to know he was gonna be a baby about it?
Come here, you two. Come on.
Come to Edna, my dears.
Not my brand of bird.
Fine. I can't win. I didn't even want
to tell a story in the first place.
Stupid chickens.
Monsters. There's no such thing
as monsters.
[thunder crashes]
[Banzou laughing manically]
They're down there somewhere.
Can't you feel it?
Yes, yes!
The atmosphere is positively electric.
[gasps and screams] [pants]
Did you have to say that?
[echoing wail]
-[Peng breathes intensely]
-[gentle snoring]
Monsters.
[sighs]
New plan.
They'll be fine here.
Okay.
Not too bad.
I should be able to fly.
Not now, Stanley.
Not in front of the eggs.
[Stanley clucks sleepily]
[ladder creaks]
[Stanley sleep-talking]
Those are my nuggets.
-[creaking continues]
-[Stanley snoring]
[yelps and grunts]
[frog croaking]
What the--?
[frog croaking]
Shh!
[loud croak]
Will you quit it?
Look. They'll be better off without me.
-Liar.
-Don't judge me.
I'm doing the best I can here.
-Liar.
-They're slowing me down.
-It's not like I promised them anything.
-Pants on fire.
[frog grunts]
-That'll teach you.
-Liar.
-Liar.
-Liar.
-Liar.
-Liar. Liar.
I'm out of here-- Ow!
-That hurt.
-What are you doing?
Oh, hi. Hey.
Uh... uh...
I'm not doing anything. Just...
you know, a little Tai Chi. You know?
Limbering up. You know, little stretching?
You want to Tai Chi or...
Tai Chao?
-Yeah. Feels great.
-[Chi sighs]
[bones crack]
[chuckles]
Got a big day ahead of us. So...
let's go. Let's get a move on. [chuckles]
[Chao yawns]
-What's for breakfast?
-Come on, Chao.
I really hope he grows up soon.
The little duck was just tired, my dear.
I was talking about the goose, Stanley.
Um, hello? Goosey McGooseface?
My brother is really hungry.
So? He can eat when we get there.
You have no idea what you're in store for.
[screams] No, no, no!
Leave me alone!
Holy moly! Jeez!
What the heck is...
-[crunching]
-[yelps]
You didn't tell me about this!
He's completely nuts!
What are we supposed to do?
Hey there, little fella.
Feeling better?
[demonic voice] I must have food...
right now.
[gasps]
Okay. Not good. Not good at all.
Hold on, little bro.
[demonic voice] Food now...
Where the heck are you supposed
to find it?
-What do you think?
-No, no!
[frog and Chao screaming] -I don't like it!
-Better?
-No!
-Uh...
-[slowed voices] It's okay.
-No!
Finally.
[stomach rumbling]
[loud splattering]
What is that? That's disgusting!
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!
It's yucky.
[crying]
-I don't like it!
-Here you go, buddy.
[chewing]
[sighs]
-[Peng pants]
-Come on, Peng. Let's go.
[Banzou laughing demonically]
Now, chicken...
tell me again.
Where did the goose go?
You have no right to...
Shush, my dear.
You'll wake the baby.
What was his name again?
Oh, yes, that's right.
-I think his name is breakfast.
-Breakfast?
-I'll give you breakfast!
-Put Andrew down right now.
[Elsa] Stanley. My hero.
[sighs]
[chicken clucking]
Which way did they go?
[gulps] That way.
[huffs] Can't you guys walk any faster?
Wait, where's Chao?
He wandered off again, didn't he?
-What's the matter with him now?
-He thinks you'll leave him behind.
-He's frightened.
-Why would he think that?
I mean... That's crazy. Look. You know what geese do
-when they need help?
-Uh-uh.
They honk. All you have to do
is take a lungful of air... [inhales]
...then let it all out
in one blast, like this.
[honks loudly]
Wow!
You've got some mad skills.
[Chao hoots weakly]
See? It's simple.
[breathes in deeply and exhales,
hoots loudly]
[Peng and Chi laughing]
-[singing in Mandarin language]
-Shh!
Follow me.
[singing continues]
Wait! What do you think you're doing?
Wait!
[banging, dog barking angrily]
-Sorry!
-We'll bring it back.
-[shouts angrily in Mandarin]
-My bad! Sorry!
[snarls]
[all hollering and yelping]
[snarling]
That wasn't that bad.
[all screaming]
Stop it!
[bicycle bell ringing]
[all screaming]
Whoa. That is not a good look.
[dog barking]
[car tires screeching]
[Peng grunts]
-Yuck!
-[pig farts]
No, no, no!
[screaming]
That was close. [chuckles]
[pig farts]
[groans]
Gross.
[all together] Whoa!
[screaming, gasping, and groaning]
[yelling] [slowed, indistinct shouting]
Look out!
Oh...
-[Banzou gasps]
-[pigs oink and grunt]
[pigs fart and oink]
Great. [yelps and grunts]
[sighs] Huh?
[panicked squealing]
-[weakly] Uh-oh. Not again.
-[pig farts]
[geese chuckle]

-[sighs] Great. Now what?
-What?
That's just a wall.
We just walk around it.
-I mean, how long can it be?
-Yeah.
About that...
[snoring and honking]
[whispers] Are you asleep?
Are you asleep?
[continues snoring]
[Chao laughing]
-[boing]
-[Chao laughs]
-Is he okay?
-I don't know.
-Sounds like he's gonna lay an egg.
-[Chao chuckles]
[Peng choking]
[gasps]
Who would do that?!
What? Oh, boy!
Chao, stop that.
There might be spiders in there.
Piders? I don't see any piders.
[gasps] Shh!
[birds chirping]
-I can't wait to fly again.
-[sighs]
-What's it like?
-What? Flying?
I mean, when you're up there it's just...
you and the clouds.
There's nothing like it.
It is complete freedom. And no one's got
their feathers in my beak hole.
[ducklings laughing]
[Chi sighs]
-What?
-I hope I get to fly, someday. Of course you will. Why wouldn't you?
Everyone said we wouldn't need to
in Pleasant Valley.
-Pleasant Valley?
-Yeah. That's where we were going.
Until someone ran into us. [chuckles]
They say it's a peaceful place
where only the best ducks go.
Ow! I hurt my head! Is anybody there?
Chi, I don't know how peaceful
it's gonna be with Chao around.
[Chi chuckles]
-Hey. You must have lots of siblings.
-No. They got taken. I was the last egg.
Oh.
Well, I'm sorry. That's terrible.
Well, I was too young to know.
Besides, the whole flock
is really my family and... [sighs]
-What?
-Nothing. I was just...
realizing what a jerk I was
to my flock.
Especially JingJing.
My girlfriend, JingJing.
I kind of messed things up.
-Well, did you apologize?
-No, I didn't apologize.
-Of course not.
-Why not?
'Cause you never apologize.
Apologizing is a sign of weakness.
Well, that's just dumb.
-Plus, if I did... she'd...
-Be your girlfriend again?
That's a good point. You're pretty smart,
but you don't know everything.
-Like?
-You don't know how to fly.
-Come on.
-Peng, no. Really, I'm good.
-I don't want to.
-Be quiet and reach out your wing.
It'll be a hop, skip, and a jump.
Here we go. Come on.
Flap. Flap! Good, good! That's good!
Great! You're getting it!
-Nice!
-That's it. You got it!
-Oh, my God!
-Chi, you're a natural!
I'm really flying, Peng!
Crap, oh, no!
[Chi screaming]
No, no! No, no! Hey! No! Chao!
-[Chao screaming]
-Whoa!
Help me, Chi!
I'm really flying.
Stay up there!
Oh, no! Oh!
This is crazy. I can't believe this.
We're flying. We're literally flying!
-We're doing it!
-This is so cool!
-[Chao] Uh-oh.
-[Chi screaming]
[both laughing]
[Peng shouting] Look out!
[Peng] I'm okay. I'm all right.
Luckily, I landed on something soft.
[Chi] Yeah. Us.
-[Chi] You nincompoop.
-[Chao] You got a big butt.
-[Peng] I do not have a big butt.
-[Chi chuckles]
I have very thin legs.
Anyway. Come on. Let's go.
I know this is all fun and games,
but the leaves mean winter is coming,
so we gotta go.
And winter means snow,
and snow is not our friend.
-[Chi laughing]
-[Peng] Brrr!
[babbling] That's it. Game's over.
I'm gonna count to three and if you're not
up here, you don't even want to know.
-One. I said, "One." Two...
-[ducklings laughing]
All right, three-- [gasps]
-[ducklings laughing]
-You little piranhas.
Gotcha!
-Looks like you messed with the...
-[Chi laughing]
-[frog croaking]
-Chi?
-Yeah?
-Where's Chao?
Uh...
He wandered off. Again.
Outstanding work, flock.
We made it to the waypoint
with no losses.
Except for Peng, that is,
but we're not giving up yet.
Birds of a feather, migrate together.
[all] Birds of a feather,
migrate together.
Never give up!
-Peng's never coming back, JingJing.
-What?
He... He never deserved you.
-Dad, we've talked about this before.
-If I may, young lady?
You need a gander who's strong,
accompanied by an infallible intellect,
and a side order of humility.
But a big, big side order.
-Someone like-- Someone like your dad.
-He is like you, Dad.
I've been trying to tell you.
He's handsome.
Handsome?
He's strong. Sure, he's reckless,
and a bit of a show-off.
-Well...
-But deep down,
underneath that narcissistic,
annoying exterior...
-I--
-Wait. Narcissistic?
I don't know why I like Peng, Dad.
It's weird.
-The heart wants.
-What the heart wants.
It's as clear as the beak on my face.
No daughter of mine's saddling up
with that sad excuse for a gander.
You just try and stop me, Daddy.
Oh!
-Awkward.
-Good afternoon, ladies.
[both] Ladies?
[wind blowing]
-You don't think he's...
-Yeah.
-For reals?
-Totally.
Really?
-[shouts] Chao?
-[echo repeating]
He's not in there. See?
He's got more sense than to go in to some
creepy, dark, scary cave.
-[Chao from a distance] This is so cool.
-[echo repeating]
Oh, geez.
Okay, we gotta go get him.
[stammers]
Let me present something to you.
-How much do you like your brother?
-A lot.
-Okay? I like him a lot.
-But, but...
What you have to understand is,
this is a sub, underground enviro.
-I'm used to being above it all.
-[echo repeating]
-That didn't come out right.
-Mm-hmm.
All right. Fine.
We'll go in and get the little stinker.
No, no, no. It's just
that we're underground. It's dark.
It's smelly. It's...
Great, we're gonna die.
-Chao!
-[echo repeating]
-Chi!
-[echo repeating]
He's this way.
N-Not so fast! Wait for me.
I have goosebumps on my goosebumps,
and I'm a goose, for Pete's sake.
Fine. Fine. I'm fine.
-[Peng] Nothing to worry about.
-[Chi] Are you sure?
Yeah. [Peng screams]
-What was that? Something just touched me.
-What is it?
[Peng]
I don't know. It's slimy and smelly and...
[Peng sighs in relief and laughs]
It's just Chao.
[Chao in distance]
Guys, you've gotta come see this.
[Peng gasps]
-[goofy voice] Will you be my buddy?
-[screams in fear] Wait for me!
Mommy! [grunts]
-[hollow thud]
-Ow!
[Chi] Wow!
Wow! It's like... It's like stars.
[Chi] I think they're glowworms.
[jingling]
Glowworms?
How do... How do they glow like that?
Well, it's actually two chemicals
reacting in their bellies.
-[hiccups]
-[Peng] Why would you know that?
[Chao farts, gasps]
Gross. I gotta go swim or something.
Spicy.
-Chao, look.
-Oh. It looks like us.
-[ducklings laughing]
-[both gasp]
[Peng laughs] Gotcha.
"Oh, Peng. My friend and I would like
to have a word with you."
Hey, I remember them.
-[ducklings chuckle]
-[Peng] Bla, bla...
"Goose, actually."
[Peng imitating Larry] "I'm a turtle.
Sounds like I have a frog in my throat."
[retches] Ribbit.
[all laughing]
-[Peng] Wow, that's pretty cool, Chi.
-I'm not doing that one.
-[Peng] Pretty good, Chao.
-That's not me.
But if you didn't do it,
and he's not doing it,
-and I'm definitely not doing--
-[screech]
All my favorites in one place.
Duck, duck, goose.
Guys, run.
[Chao wails]
[Banzou hissing]
[Peng huffs and puffs]
-[Chao] Where did they go?
-[Chi] Peng? Where are you guys?
-Chi?
-Chao?
-Where are you?
-Peng?
[Banzou roars] Dead goose! Hear me?
-[Chao] Peng?
-[Chi] Peng, we need to go.
The cat is gonna get us. He's after us!
[Banzou in singsong voice, echoing]
Ducklings, come out to play.
All right. Which way is out of here?
-[boings]
-Owie!
-What are you doing?
-You'll see.
This way. Come on. Hurry.
[Chao hiccups]
[Banzou] Oh, ducklings.
-Come out, come out, wherever you are.
-[echo repeating]
This way. Come on. Hurry.
That's the way out.
[Banzou laughs]
You can't "duck" me forever.
Up you go. Hey, I'm right here.
Keep going. Fast as you can.
[Banzou snarls]
-[Chi] I can't do it.
-[Peng] Yes, you can. Keep going.
[Banzou] Ready or not.
Come on, come on!
[Banzou changes voice] We're coming.
[Peng] Hurry!
[Banzou snarls] [ducklings and Peng scream]
[they shriek]
[Peng laughs] Guys,
I have a bad feeling about th-i-i-i-s...!
Argh! Whoa!
That was it? [laughs]
I thought it was going to be bigg--
[screams]
[waterfall thunders]
[Chao shouting] This is not go-o-o-o-d!
[river churns] -[Chi gasps]
-[Peng coughs]
[all panting]
[Chao chuckles]
-[Chi] I'm dizzy.
-[Chao] This is so cool.
-Chi! Peng!
-[Chi] I need to lie down.
[Peng and Chi huff and puff]
I feel sick.
-I don't know what to feel.
-Chi, look at me! Cannonball!
Am I crazy
or is your brother indestructible?
-[Chao] Check this out!
-Using air currents?
That was pretty genius.
Yeah, well,
that's a little thing I invented.
I tried to show my flock,
but they weren't ready for it yet.
It's the road. It's the road!
You found the road!
-You did it, Peng. You really did it!
-[Chao laughing]
[Chi] Whoo-hoo!
-[Chi] Yes! We're going home!
-[Chao] All right! -[Chi laughs]
-[Peng] Well, how 'bout that?
-I told you I'd get you here, right?
-Yeah!
[Chi chuckles]
You know, I always trust my instincts. All we gotta do is cross the river,
hit the road,
and I'm sure we'll catch up
with your flock.
-Chi? Is Pleasant Valley really home?
-What?
I don't know if I want to go
back to the others now.
-Chao, you can't be serious.
-Well, we are kind of a family, aren't we?
-You've imprinted, haven't you?
-I didn't mean to.
[Chi chuckles]
-[distant honking]
-My flock. Guys. Guys!
Guys, wait for me!
It's me! It's me.
-Please.
-[honking]
All right, flock. Time to wander
into the deep blue yonder.
-Where's he going?
-Peng? Where are you going?
[Peng honks and pants]
Please. Wait.
[geese honking]
What's up with Peng?
I don't know.
Peng. What is it? What's going on?
What's wrong?
[pants] What's...
What's wrong? Didn't you see?
That was my flock.
I could've caught up with them.
But at every turn,
you guys slow me down.
How am I going to get to the Haven now?
Should have left you with the pigs.
-You were going to leave us?
-He was gonna leave us
whenever it suited him, Chao.
I got you to your road. Okay?
This whole time you weren't helping us,
you were using us.
Yes. No, not-- At the beginning I...
I found your road, okay?
Look. I gotta go.
You know what, Peng?
Your instincts stink.
Come on, Chao.
[tearfully] Don't go, Mom. Please.
I said come on, Chao.
Forget him.
[birds hoot and call] [waterfall thunders]
[laughs menacingly]
[screams in pain]
Guys! Guys, wait!
[branch crashes]
Wait! No!
Oh, no! [grunts]
[shouts] Come back, you guys!
Aah!
[whimpers, groans]
[shouting] Somebody help. Wait! Come back!
[eagle screeches]
-JingJing?
-Incoming!
[grunts, yells]
[grunts in pain]
[sniffs]
Tada! [laughs]
-Another perfect landing, man.
-Wait, are you a squirrel?
You know what?
I'm not really into labels per se?
I find them limiting.
Like, I wouldn't call you a badger.
That's because I'm not a badger.
Yeah. So you see what I'm talking about?
Right on.
-Hey, I'm Carl. Bring it in, brah.
-Ow!
Hey. Wait a second. Yes.
Definitely picking up on a negative aura
around this general wing area.
Yeah. It's called pain.
I've injured my wing.
Dude, this is your lucky, lucky day.
Lucky for you,
I am artful in the ways of healing.
-Qigong, man.
-Chi what?
-Is that "goodbye" in squirrel?
-Hey. You don't have any cookies, do you?
Cookies? No.
Wait, go back to the...
Did you say you could fix my wing?
Why? What happened to your wing?
Oh, yeah, right, your wing.
Totally. Yes.
Brace yourself
because this is a four-step process.
First, is stimulation. -Stimulation? Ow! Ouch!
-[wing cracks]
-Followed by... manipulation.
-What?
[loud howl of pain echoes]
Then, a simple case of aggravation.
-[wing cracks]
-[groans in pain]
And finally, the pièce de résistance...
-incapacitation.
-Inca--?
[rapid twittering]
Goodnight, badger.
[birds hoot, insects chirrup]
[Chi sighs]
We're never gonna find our way through.
What are we going to do?
I guess we're just gonna
have to cross the river.
[Chao gasps]
-What is it?
-This is just like Peng's story.
Yeah, well, he's good at making things up.
-No, Chi. Really.
-Come on. There's no such things as--
[water gurgles and bubbles]
...m-monsters.
It's j-just a turtle, right?
It's got to be.
-[low rumble]
-[owl hooting] -I don't like it. Let's go back.
-Yeah.
Chao? Which way's back?
Um...
[gasps] Look, Chi. It looks like... It is!
I can see the other side.
[rippling in water]
Um, Chi?
[both screaming]
-[screams]
-Badger! You're awake.
-What have you done? Why?
-Duh. I'm healing your wing, brah.
That's the wrong wing!
Oh...
Uno momentito, dudu.
-[mutters to himself]
-[Peng] Ouch, ouch!
All right.
-Wait, did you hear a sheep?
-What?
-No.
-Neither did I.
[Peng] What are you doing? What?
[yelps]
-[shouts] Ouch!
-Easy there, big guy.
What the--?
Hey. You gotta chill your splints, badger.
Sit down.
-Are you sure this is gonna work?
-No problemo, man.
I'm a healer. It's what I do.
It's worked on all of my buddies.
Your buddies?
Oh. So you're not the only squirrel
up here, then?
Squirrels? [laughs]
Squirrels!
Man, these...  These aren't squirrels.
Are you crazy?
[sighs] Squirrels. Yeah. There used
to be a whole bunch of us.
Flying around, having fun. But then...
-they left.
-Oh, really? Wonder why.
Oh, you know.
They met girls, started families.
-Can you believe they did that to me?
-Surprising.
I said to my friend Rocky, I was like,
"Hey, Rocky, great for you and the moose,
but now what am I going to do
on Tuesday nights, huh?"
-Can't imagine why they'd leave.
-That's what I said!
Well, now they're all miserable
with their kids.
They are?
Well, you know,
they say they're happy, but come on.
All kids do is eat, poop, and complain.
-Right?
-Yeah. You got that right.
[sniffs] Urgh! That burns me nose hairs.
What the--? This is nuts. I gotta get...
[stammers] Forget the kids.
I gotta get to the Haven.
What? Hold the mail, man.
You live in the spa?
-Hey. You think you could get me in?
-You?
I could... You know, why not?
All right, fine.
[laughs]
Yeah, man. That's awesome.
The winters up here can be so gnarly.
Like last year, my nuts froze.
-Huh?
-Wait. What kids?
[both panting]
[Chi] It's all right. It's okay.
We're fine. Everything's fine.
[panting]
[Chao sighs]
[pants]
Carl, I don't get this. How is hanging
from a branch supposed to heal me?
Dude, you just reach out your arms
like they're wings.
What do you mean "like wings"?
They are wings.
Pretend you haven't got any.
Then pretend you do.
Then let go of the branch.
Let go?
Carl, I can't fly. Remember?
My wing is totally messed up.
Dude, flying is all about taking the leap.
I know what flying is, Carl.
It's the falling I'm worried about.
No, it's the hitting the ground
I'm worried about.
Slow your roll, Mr. Worrynuts.
What could go wrong?
You're tied to that rope.
Dude, it's all mental,
except for the physical part.
[Peng sighs]
Okay, Peng.  You can do this.
Here we go.
One.
Two.
Thre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!
Whoo-hoo! Leap of faith, man!
Oh...
Bummer.
[screaming]
-[Peng laughing]
-Whoo-hoo!
This is awesome!
[Peng] Whoo-hoo! [laughing]
-You're flying like a badger, badger.
-Whoo!
I'm flying, Carl. I'm flying! [laughing]
[Chi's voice] Oh, my God,
I'm flying. I'm really flying, Peng.
[Chao's voice] This is so cool!
Hey, that's the wrong way, man!
Yes, but I'm headed
in the right direction.
[sighs]
[gasps]
[indistinct voices]
-Chao. Hey, Chao! Quick, come and see.
-[Chao yawns]
[both laugh]
-[farmer calls to ducks]
-[ducklings chatter]
[Chi] It's so good to see you guys...
[distant honking] [indistinct chattering]
...it's beautiful!
Wow!
-[Chinese music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]
-[kids chatter in Mandarin]
-[firecrackers exploding]
-[duckling] I'm scared.
-[Chao] Does this seem right to you?
Come on. It's got to be the way
to Pleasant Valley.
[Chao] Uh, I don't think so.
-[ducklings chatter indistinctly]
-[gate clatters]
[Peng] Oh, no!
-[gasps, yells out]
-[roof tiles clatter]
-This wouldn't have happened with Peng.
-You've got to be kidding me.
He didn't care about us.
Yes, he did!
He was great and he was funny,
and he took care of us.
He wouldn't have gone away
-if you weren't so mean.
-Mean? I was trying to protect you.
I wouldn't have had to
if you weren't a baby.
You think you're looking after me,
but you're not.
Pleasant Valley isn't even real,
and you're not my mom.
Maybe not,
but right now I'm all you've got. [gasps]
[shrieking]
No!
No, no, no! Let them go!
-[wire twangs]
-[screams]
[Peng gasps]
[gasps] [indistinct chatter]
Huh?
-Chi?
-Yeah?
I'm so sorry.
-[serving dish clangs]
-[waiter speaks Mandarin]
Huh!
[woman speaks Mandarin]
-[thump]
-[woman gasps]
-Ow!
-[woman gasps]
-[woman shouts aggressively]
-[man yelps]
[waiter yawns]
-Ah!
-[door clatters]
[woman hums tune]
[gasps]
[man gasps in pain]
[man exclaims and grumbles]
[woman titters]
[Chao] It's Peng.
Shh! [whispering] Come on. Let's go.
Go. Quick, now.
[man gasps]
[Peng whispering]
Quick. Find a place to hide.
[hiccuping]
[man speaks Mandarin] -[hiccups]
-[gasps]
[Chao continues to hiccup]
-[Chao hiccups]
-[man chuckles]
[man cries out]
[waiter humming]
[Chi] Come on, hurry.
-[woman speaks Mandarin]
-[man cries out] [ducklings squawking]
[waiter speaking Mandarin]
-[Peng screams]
-[customer exclaims in Mandarin]
[ducklings gasp]
Hurry! Just go, go!
[woman thumps door, cries out]
Get out of here. I'll catch up. Go on.
-[honking]
-[waiter cries out] [customers cry out]
-Peng!
-Chi! Go! Go! As fast as you can.
[woman shouts in Mandarin] Oh, poop. [thumps against door]
Peng, over here! Help us!
This way!
-Come on, hurry. Hurry!
-[ducklings squawking]
[speaks Mandarin]
[shouts aggressively]
[Peng screams]
-No!
-[man thumps against door]
Guys? Chao? Chi?
-Where did you go?
-[Chao] We're here!
Peng! Aah!
Oh, no! [honks]
[fireworks whistle]
Hey, Chi! You guys, over here!
Slow down. Wait!
-Don't go that way.
-[ducklings squawking]
-[bicycle bell ringing]
-[Peng] Whoa!
-[Chao] Over here!
-Hey, you guys!
No, no, no! Don't! Chi! Chao!
[fireworks explode]
Kids?
[Chi] Argh! Get off of us.
-[Chi] Get off!
-[Chao] Let me go!
[Banzou laughs]
-[Chi] Peng!
-Lost something, goose?
You know, I've really enjoyed the hunt,
but I much prefer the torture,
the dismemberment,
and the gamy aftertaste.
-[Banzou slurps]
-[Chao] Ew!
-[fireworks explode]
-[Banzou snarls]
Kids, go! Run!
-[boxes clatter]
-[ducklings gasp]
[Banzou grunts]
-[Banzou snarls]
-[firecrackers bang]
Quickly! Come on, run! Come on!
Quickly. Let's go!
-[Peng pants]
-[Banzou snarls]
[Banzou snarls]
[Chao] Peng!
[Peng] Ow!
-[Banzou growls]
-[Peng grunts] [Peng groans]
Kill him.
-[Chi] No! Leave him alone!
-[Chao] Let him go!
Kids, forget about me. Just go, now!
Don't worry,
I'll look after the family
once you've gone.
Say goodbye, Daddy.
Peng!
[forcefully] Call... me... mommy.
[ice cracks]
[Banzou squeals]
You're coming with me!
No!
[both gurgling]
-No, Peng!
-Peng!
Come back! No!
-[Peng splutters]
-[ducklings gasp]
-No! Let him go!
-[Peng and Banzou gurgle]
[Peng gasps]
[Peng pants]
[Peng and ducklings panting]
[fireworks continue]
[Banzou snarls]
[Peng] This is crazy.
Why can't you leave us alone?
Birds are so arrogant.
[snarls]
[shivers] Always flying away
at the first sign of danger.
But nobody's flying anywhere.
Tonight you're going to go out
with... [shudders] ...a whimper.
-No. You're going out with a bang.
-[Chao burps]
-[fire hissing]
-No. No, no!
[Banzou screams]
No!
-[fireworks whistle]
-No-o-o-o-o-o!
[distant meowl]
[Peng sighs]
-[Chao] Are you okay, Mom?
-I thought I'd lost you.
-Come here, come here.
-[ducklings chuckling]
[sighs] Thought I'd lost you.
-[fireworks continue]
-[Peng huffs and puffs]
[Peng pants]
Whoa. Great.
-Guys, it's...
-[wind whistles]
...snow.
We gotta go.
Where? Where are we going?
Home.
You're coming home with me.
[wind howls]
[Peng huffs and puffs]
Keep up, guys. We're doing it.
We'll just keep going. Right?
Just follow my path.
We can do this.
[wind howling]
[Chao] Ugh!
-Argh!
-Oh!
Peng!
[Peng gasps]
Up you go. There. Hold on tight.
[Peng cries out, grunts]
[screaming]
[they grunt]
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.
[gasps] Wow. Look.
-Chi, what is that?
-The Haven!
Why is it so misty?
Well, that's because they're hot pools,
right, Peng?
Peng?
-Peng!
-[Chao] Peng, no!
[Chi whimpers] No. [ducklings weep]
[Peng gasps and groans]
[weakly] We're at the end of the line,
kids.
You're...
You're going to have to go on without me.
-[Chi crying] No, no.
-But...
But. But, but...
[whimpers]
You're not coming with us?
Not this time, buddy.
But you have to.
Otherwise, what was all of this about?
-[cries] No.
-It was about getting you to a family.
-That's just right over the ridge.
-No. No!
Don't you get it? Okay? You're our family.
Yes. Yes, I am.
And now I'm telling you...
you gotta get to safety, okay?
Because that's what mommies do.
[ducklings cry]
You can do it, guys.
It's just a hop, skip, and a jump.
Yeah, well...
We're sticking together
because that's what families do.
[Chi grunts and strains]
Faster, little brother.
You gotta push, okay? Push!
Push!
[ducklings panting]
[Peng] Oh, no.
[Peng cries out]
[ducklings huff and puff]
[Chao] I can't do it, Chi.
-[Chi grunts]
-He's... he's so heavy.
-And my wings hurt.
-Chao!
Honk! Peng told us to honk
if we need help.
You can do it, Chao. Use your honk.
-Honk like crazy! You got to honk louder.
-[Chao honks]
You can do it!
[honks very loudly]
It's not working.
[continues to honk]
[Chi] Watch out!
-Stabilizing. We have contact.
-JingJing.
Am I holding you up?
[Chao] Yeah!

How about here?
-It's good. You know, continue.

So, you made it back, eh?
Didn't fly into a cliff?
I gotta be honest, I'm surprised. [laughs]

Look at the time.
I gotta go prepare for spring migration.

Wait. You think two's gonna be enough?
[Peng stammers]
Two would... Two, actually...
I mean... I think it's more than...
You know, I... Two.
We should wait for spring, right?
I mean, that's what everyone does.
Not that I care what other people do.
I just want you to be happy,
but, you know, if we had two...
We don't even have a nest. Right?
I mean, you know, two plus...
Can I just take a nap?
