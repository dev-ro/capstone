Dr. Weissler report to delivery.
Look at that cute baby!
That's me, Elle Evans.
And the smelly, less-cute baby right
next to me? That's my best friend Lee.
Lee and I were born on the same day,
at the same time,
here in Los Angeles, California.
Our moms were BFFs before people
even used the term "BFF,"
so we were raised like twins
and we've been pretty much
inseparable ever since.
♪ Be together, be together... ♪
I don't remember a lot
from before high school,
but for as long as I can remember,
Lee and I have absolutely
loved to dance.
♪ Watching the moonlight
You dance in shadow ♪
♪ Fantastic dream of a dream ♪
♪ The moon and the stars
are a lover's creation... ♪
Anyway a lot of stuff has happened
between now and then.
Let me get you up to speed.
First Christmas I remember, I was six.
I got a Barbie dance party.
Lee got a scooter.
Broke my leg riding Lee's scooter.
Had my cast signed by Lee, who bought me
ice cream to make up for breaking my leg.
Dressed as a cowboy for Halloween,
Lee went as a doctor.
Learned how to ride a bike,
learned how to swim.
Got protected by Lee's older brother Noah,
who chased off some bullies
who were hassling us.
Had to pay protection tax, though.
Discovered the place
that we loved to dance most.
♪ Let's just dance ♪
♪ Rip it up
When they open the rule book ♪
♪ Rip it up
Forget about your school work ♪
♪ Rip it up, yeah ♪
Watched Lee catch his first fish.
Watched Noah in his first fight. He won.
Dressed as a fireman for Halloween.
Lee went as some weird bird.
Found out that my mom was sick.
Went to visit her in the hospital
for the first time.
Tried to get used to seeing her there.
Got in a fight with Lee
over who's the best dancer.
Made up by getting him ice cream.
Got in a fight with Noah
for beating up Lee.
Made up with Noah
by letting him fix my bike.
He is so handy!
Got my first bra. Didn't really need it.
Discovered I like soccer.
Discovered a way to get
to our favorite place to dance.
♪ Looking for love
in all the wrong places ♪
♪ No fine girls just ugly faces ♪
♪ Says she wanna dance
to a different groove ♪
♪ Now you know what to do G
bust a move ♪
♪ What you want baby you got it
Just bust a move ♪
Discovered that I wasn't gonna be
a fashion icon.
Discovered I am good at sports.
Had a tough talk with Dad.
Sat with mom in the hospital.
I tried to help her put makeup on.
Not much help.
Hey...
Held her hand a long time.
Only cried when she was asleep.
Tried to score my first kiss
with Randy Melrose.
Wasn't exactly a love connection.
Watched Noah getting really, really cute!
Watched Noah in yet another fight.
He won.
Got my period! Finally!
Went as a pirate for Halloween.
Lee was the Black Swan.
Said goodbye to my mom.
Had a lot to say.
Told her all about Noah.
Watched Noah ride his motorcycle
for the first time.
Watched Lee try to ride Noah's motorcycle.
Watched Noah teach Lee a lesson
for sitting on his motorcycle.
Celebrated with Lee
when he got his dream car.
Learned that girls can be really mean.
Played Seven Minutes in Heaven. Fail!
Got a bra I suddenly did need!
Wondered why I still hadn't been
kissed yet or even been on a date.
No big deal, I guess.
Realized I had a crush on Noah.
Got over my crush on Noah...
mostly.
♪ Everybody holding hands... ♪
Well...
I think that's about it.
♪ It's gonna be a good night ♪
And that's me today,
savoring the last fleeting moments
of summer at Lee's totally awesome house.
It's moments like this that make me wish
things could stay this way forever.
Ew! Perv!
Hey, Lee, guess what Warren
texted the entire school!
Lee?
- Lee?
- Geronimo!
Oh, no.
Oh, my God! That was a good one!
That was a good one!
Here, come here, take a seat.
So, tomorrow, first day of school,
the student council
is expecting our dance club idea
this week for the fall fundraiser.
We're gonna be in trouble if we don't
come up with something fast.
Yeah.
♪ I saw you sliding out the bar... ♪
I know what you're thinking.
Noah Flynn is stupid hot,
but Lee and I developed
a list of friendship rules.
Lee was responsible for Rule Number Nine,
which specifically states,
"relatives of your best friend
are totally off-limits."
This is a really big one for Lee.
I guess it comes from living
in the shadow of a high school legend.
Lee, you seen my athletic cup?
Yes, asshat.
I needed it for all those varsity sports
I'm constantly playing, you know?
Hey, Shelly.
He knows I hate being called Shelly.
Yes, Noah?
I know he hates being called Noah.
When did you get the boobs?
When you were at football camp
learning to be a better douche.
It was almost like she was
on human growth hormones or something.
Lee! Rule Number Two, please!
Rule Number Two:
Never share our secrets with anyone else.
Whatever. Listen. M and D are out of town
Friday night, so party starts at eight.
Don't invite any jackasses.
Does that include you?
Ay!
Ah!
Ow.
What an ass!
I know!
Hey, hey, hey!
Rule Number Nine, young lady!
Oh, come on!
As if!
Yeah, well, you got a little bit of drool
on the corner of your mouth.
- Right here? Oh, do I?
- Yeah.
- Do I really?
- You do.

Oh, no! Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God!
Hey, Dad, where are
my other pairs of school pants?
They're at the cleaners.
Come on!
♪ But changing roles... ♪
Ninth grade skirt on eleventh grade body.
Perfect!
Okay.
Good morning!
- Morning.
- Morning.
Elle...
Dad, my pants ripped.
This is literally all I had.
I swear. I promise.
Okay, I suppose I could
swing by the cleaners,
drop them off at school.
Really?
Oh, my God, that would be amazing!
Thank you!
Bye! I love you!

♪ 'Cause honey with you... ♪
Don't say anything!
Okay? My pants ripped.
- You should have back-ups.
- My backups are at the cleaners.
- What about your back-up back-ups?
- These are my back-up back-ups!
- Okay, okay!
- Come on, let's go!
Okay, I'm trying.
Seriously though, cover up.
- Like, I'm trying to drive.
- Stop! You're so stupid!

♪ It struck me
That the two of us could run ♪
Nice landing, ace!
Well, if you got your driver's license,
you wouldn't have to put up
with my driving.
Okay, but why would I do that
when I have you as my personal chauffeur?
True.
Oh! And today,
fundraiser ideas.
- Fine.
- Thank you!
Hey, man, is that girl new?
Jeez, guys! Check out that.
Oh, my word!
Yo! I think that's Elle Evans!
Everybody's looking at us.
Allow me to revise.
Everyone is looking at you.
- Damn!
- What? No, they're not!
Elle, you are aware that your lady shape
sort of changed over the summer, right?
It was true.
This was the moment
that happens to all of us
when you suddenly go from invisible
to everyone staring at you.
- What the hell, Tuppen?
- It's fine, Lee. I got this.
Relax, tiny Flynn.
How about I relax your face?
Lee, it's fine! I got this! Lee!
I did not think that through.
No, no, no!
Noah!
Noah, stop!
Enough, Noah! Stop! Are you crazy?
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
Now you three, in my office!
- Me?
- Now!
Everyone, homeroom! Now!
Douchebag!
He even gets credit for my fights!
Why did you do that?
Lee was in trouble.
Any excuse for a fight, right?
I don't start fights, okay?
I only finish them.
And besides,
no one should treat a girl like that.
Especially if that girl is you.
Me?
Yeah. It's like those guys are trying
to get in my little sister's pants,
which is super gross.
Never great to hear your childhood
crush say it's super gross in your pants.
You know, you have zero experience
with guys.
You've never even had a boyfriend.
Whatever!
Wearing a skirt like that
is asking for it.
Seriously?
You want to go down that road?
No.
I kind of just played the whole
sexist conversation out in my head
and it always ended
with me sounding like a dick.
Miss Evans.
First off,
that skirt is ridiculous.
- My pants ripped! It's all I had.
- What about your back-ups?
- Dry cleaners.
- Your back-up back-ups?
- These are my back-up back-ups!
- All right! Don't get so upset!
I am upset. Dude touched
my lady-bump.
And Mr. Tuppen will be punished,
but I also, unfortunately,
must punish you.
- Oh, my God! Am I being expelled?
- Elle...
I've never been in trouble before. I feel
like it's hot in here. I'm sweating.
- Elle!
- What?
You only broke the dress code.
That's all.
Detention tomorrow.

♪ Say yeah ♪

Oh, my God!
How crazy was that fight?
Flynn was so savage!
Have you made out with him yet?
These three super-popular juniors
are kind of package deal.
I call them the OMG Girls.
Olivia, Mia, and Gwyneth.
And I have no idea
why they're sitting with me.
Oh, my God.
I would totally have babies with Noah.
One girl, one boy.
But not at the same time though.
Mm-mmm.
Yeah, you don't really get to pick
the gender so much.
I hear he's into blondes. Too bad, Elle.
Give me your numerals.
We should def catch up.
Okay, yeah! It's 310...
Oh, my God.
Oooh.
Got to go, Elle.
There's a shemergency
in the locker room.
Oh, okay.
Sorry it didn't work out
with you and Noah.
Guess it wasn't meant to be.
What just happened? And why were
the OMG Girls being so nice to me?
But more importantly,
when did they eat those?
- Was that Mia?
- Did you see that?
She say anything about me?
You tell her about my dimples?
What did she smell like today?
Sometimes she smells like apples
or kind of like blueberry-coconut fusion.
What?
What are you doing anyway?
I am trying to find a good idea
for our carnival fundraiser.
Somebody has to.
Come on.
What about the strength game, the one
with the sledgehammer and the bell?
Yeah, the chess team picked that one.
I know.
What about... Ooh!
What about a dunking booth?
- Swimming team picked it.
- Damn it!
I know, dude! Who saw that one coming?
Okay, do you think Mia
would like this one?
Because I think it makes my eyes pop,
and I really want to kiss her on Friday.
Come on! Today was the first time
the OMGs ever spoke to me.
Do you really think Mia knows who you are?
Baby steps, Elle. Baby steps.
Lee, come on. She's a varsity cheerleader.
Basically, the only way she'd ever
make out with you is if you paid for it.
- Kissing booth!
- Kissing booth!
Oh, that is the perfect
carnival fundraiser!
Yes! Oh, also,
I love the irony. The girl who's never
been kissed does a kissing booth? What?
Yes, irony is a cruel mistress indeed.
Okay, well, now all we need
is the student council to approve it.
Yes. Don't worry. Leave that to me.
Okay. Wait.
What about this one?
Mia will love it.
- Really?
- No, dude! It's awful!
Dammit!

Psst.
Psst.

If word gets out that fighting me
is a way of getting your number,
I am in for a super long junior year.
Oh, I wouldn't really call it a fight.
Mmm.
I think I'm gonna go out with Tuppen.
- Unless you think I shouldn't.
- No, actually, I think you should.
You're gonna have to go on a date
eventually.
- Right?
- You know?
So?
God, what do people even do on dates?
I don't know.
Sit around and eat food, I guess.

- No.
- I know myself.
- No! Do not call me.
Okay? If he can't see
how completely baller you are,
Then he's not the right guy for you.
Oh! You can be so sweet

- Totally.
- Love you. Bye!
- Love you.
Have a good time!
But not too good of a time!
God! What is wrong with me?
Is my butt too big?
Am I some sort of freak or something?
No! You're awesome, all right?
Tuppen is just a dick. I don't know why
I told you to go out with him.
Maybe because he's the only guy
that's ever asked me out.
Stop it, all right? Tuppen isn't worth it.
You're way too good for him.
Plus I heard he's got like, three nipples.
Just saying.
Thanks for doing this for me.
Are you kidding me? I live for this shit.
Alrighty. Hit the road.
You had your shot.
Keep on moving, bud.
I need to talk to Elle.
Lee, it's okay.
So,
running a bit late now, are we?
Look. I'm sorry I stood you up.
I really did want to go out with you.
I just thought you deserve
a little bit of an explanation.
That would be nice.
Flynn...
told me that it wouldn't be smart
if I showed up for our date tonight.
Noah?
Yeah.
That literally makes no sense.
It's true, and it's not just me.
He's been going around
telling all the guys not to ask you out
for a while now.
What?
Shit.
There's others?
You can't tell him I told you.
Why do you care?
No boobs are worth a broken nose.
Fine!
I got to go.
Go! Whatever!
Leave!
But just so you know,
my boobs are fantastic!
Yes, some would even say breathtaking!
Shit.
You do realize
that you're not my dad, right?
Look, you still got a lot to learn, kiddo.
Kiddo? Oh, my God.
Oh, if you were here,
I would beat you with my shoe,
Tuppen is a player.
So are you!
And that's why I know he's wrong for you.
- You're gonna thank me one day.
- Okay.
Well, today is not that day.
It is not your job to monitor
my dating life. Do you understand me?
The days of you controlling my life
are over!
We'll see about that.
Next proposal is from the dance club.
Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.
You have an accent.
Sorry.
I thought that was gonna be funnier.
And what is your idea for the fundraiser?
Um...
Sorry.
Okay.
We have an idea that we think
everyone will be very excited about.
But first, we want to thank you
for your time
and ask that you withold any...
Kissing booth!
Yeah, we want to do a kissing booth.
Hmm.
Okay, I think I speak for everyone
when I say kissing is the number one cause
of all germs, cavities,
shingles, gingivitis,
- cold sores...
- Ew.
Uh, it would be totally voluntary.
And no tongue,
because we're not the French.
Most of us.
I'm British, you wanker!
Excuse me,
- but would you be working the booth?
- Me?
No.
We're just the organizers.
But I can assure you,
we have some real A-listers lined up.
You can count on that.
Would Flynn be working the kissing booth?
Ha! Noah?
You'd have a better chance getting
Miley Cyrus to become a nun...
Absolutely! No, Flynn
will be working the booth.
I promise. Flynn will be there.
Hmph.
You're about to witness
a family tradition.
For as long as I can remember,
we've had lunch with the Flynns
every Sunday.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!
That's Mrs. Flynn.
She's sort of a surrogate mom to me.
I couldn't have made it through the years
without her.
How's school going?
Let's just say, "interesting."
I don't know what that means, but I want
to hear all the gory details later.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi there.
- And how's my favorite little man?
- I'm okay.
Hey, Noah! I haven't seen you
since you got back from football camp.
They got you starting again?
Well... he'll be lucky if he makes it
through the season.
He goes and gets into a fight
on the first day of school.
Really? What happened?
Tell him.
Here it comes.
It was just an argument over something
that happened at football camp.
Excuse me.
Wonder why he didn't say anything.
Our booth is going to kick ass
at the carnival.
Oh, and news update:
Mia stopped me in the hall and said
that she's going to the party tonight.
She wanted to make sure
that I would be there.
Well, sir, I wish you
the best of luck with that.
Oh, I have to go to practice right now.
Can you still give me
a ride afterwards?
Oh, I can't. I'm taking my parents
to the airport.
But Noah can give you a ride.
Convince him to do the booth.
You're gonna have to ask him
eventually.
We're having a party at my place
tonight if you guys want to come.
My parents aren't going to be home,
so there's gonna be drinks.
- My brother will be there, but you know.
- Hey.
I'll catch you guys later.
Bye.
He's so cute!
Hey.
Lee said that you're gonna give me a ride.
- Yeah.
- Where's your car?
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Look, I have a spare helmet.
You'll be fine.
I'm not gonna get on that thing
like one of your make-out girls.
They don't all make out with me.
Okay, so like,
95% of them make out with me, but that is
clearly not what's happening here,
so if you could just
get on the damned bike please.
It's so beautiful outside,
I think I'm gonna go for a run.
- Are you serious? It's like five miles.
- What?
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry. Can't hear you.
I'll see you at the party, okay?
No, you won't. I told you not to come.
Better get used to disappointment!
See? I knew that you could hear me.

Asked who?
Flynn, silly!
About the booth.
Oh, he looks busy.
You're funny!
I love this hoe!
I love you!

- Go!
- Right now?

Okay!
Yes, honey! Get it!
I haven't seen Lee.
What?
The OMG Girls want to know
if you'll do our kissing booth.
No.
Okay, you win, Noah.
You want me to wash your motorcycle?
Polish your trophies?
Did you just put hands on me?

Okay, you should probably leave.
What?
She's like important to my family,
which kind of makes her important to me.
Are you for serious?
Leave.
Uh, sorry I ruined your make-out sesh.
Oh, it's fine.
She kind of tasted like Cheetos anyway.
That's gross.
So...
Kissing booth?
Absolutely not.
Awesome.
Oh, my God! That was so savage!
- That girl totally left!
- Yeah.
You'll love this.
Tastes like pink.
Ooh!
So, Flynn's still doing the booth?

Oh, my God!
I'm in Noah's t-shirt!
Oh, no!
Dress is missing
but underwear is still on.
Okay. We can work with that.
Oh, sweet mercy!
Sorry.
It's okay.
I didn't mean to wake you.
I was just grabbing some clothes.
So, how bad was I?
You were about to strip on the pool table
in front of a bunch of guys
and then go skinny dipping.
I carried you out
before too much came off.
Oh, and you threw up on your dress.
Noah, I am so sorry.
It's okay. But I mean, this is exactly
what I was talking about, Shelly.
Oh, this is so embarrassing!
Oh, I hope I didn't snore.
Elle, I...
I slept in the guest room.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
Okay.
I am assuming the t-shirt means
you saw me in my underwear?
- Yep.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Okay!
Shorts, please!
Can you... please?
Noah!
- Noah!
- All right, fine.
I'll just get it myself!
- Stop pulling!
- I'm not pulling anything!
Okay, well my arm is caught!
Let me just reach down and...
Oh, my God! I just touched it!
I said stop wiggling!
Sorry!
Aren't you forgetting something?
My t-shirt.
- Your t-shirt. Right. I'm sorry.
- Elle!
- What?
- Jesus!
I was kidding!
- So, I should...
- Just get out, dork.
Okay, yeah. Yeah.
Never let me drink again.
It's okay. I got it covered.
Made you an emergency survival kit.
Some granola, sports drinks, antacids,
and an epic dose of awkward shame!
Thank you.
Oh, and... really good work last night.
What do you mean?
You told everybody that Noah and the OMGs
would be doing the kissing booth.
Come on!
And even though I felt
like I was about to puke my liver out,
I couldn't stop thinking about Noah.
Our accidental groping.
It seemed like he just saw me
as a little sister,
but I couldn't help wondering if he had
a different reason for protecting me.
Listen, it's all about the OMGs.
We get them to do the booth,
everyone else will follow.
- Do you want to go over the plan again?
- No, I think I got it.
- Okay, wish me luck!
- Good luck.
Okay!
Have you guys seen this text?
Hey, Ellen!
Hey...
It's "Elle," actually. No "N."
Why are you standing and talking
instead of sitting and talking?
Oh, yeah, okay.
Ask Mia about me!
- Lee wants to know if you like him.
- Flynn's brother?
Yeah, he's cute.
Needs to learn to dress, though.
But more importantly,
everything's set
for the kissing booth, right?
Okay, so here's what I just heard.
Flynn likes one of you. Yeah.
And rumor has it that if the person
he likes is working the booth,
then he'll be there, too.
Wait! Didn't we tell you?
Tell me what?
Now that we're all besties,
we would totally do
the kissing booth, girl. Just for you.
- Really?
- You're one of us now, girl.
Totally!
- Thank you, guys.
- Sure!
You can call us bitches.
Thank you!
Bitches!
You're welcome!
So we've got a pretty solid line up now,
but we're still down
one Noah Flynn, though.
But let's focus on the booth.
I'm going to make the letters,
and then you are going to make
everything else. Okay?
We're only two days away from the carnival
so we need to move. Chop-chop!
Have I ever told you that you're bossy?
Yes, but then I told you
not to tell me that anymore.
- Ha-ha-ha. You're funny.
- I prefer the term "witty."
- I'm more of a slapstick guy myself.
- Really?
I am sorry. Was that the wrong color?
Oh, you're gonna...
Oh, you're so dead!
Hello.
Holy shit! She looks like
a hot Braveheart!
- You need to leave.
- Stop it!
I told you before, stop messing around.
I'll leave when I want to!
You're not the boss of me, Noah.
Yearbook!
I'll just delete this immediately.
Come on, let's just go, huh?
I mean it.
Now put your shirt on and get out.
What he said made sense.
It also meant he cared.
But what came out of my mouth was...
I told you to stop telling me what to do.
Oh!
Watch this, Noah Flynn.
Go, Elle!
Go, Elle!

- Hey.
- Hey.
Um, listen...
I know that we don't really see
eye-to-eye on things,
but I'm... I'm desperate.
So maybe if you could just
stop by the booth for a little.
I don't know. I just...
It would mean a lot to me.
Wow.
The independent Elle Evans
who doesn't want to be told what to do
by anyone,
is begging somebody else for help.
It is what it is, Noah.
I mean, I just really thought that maybe
it would be nice for you to do something
for people that care about you.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
Come one, come all, behold the power
and raw intensity of a kiss
from one of our beautiful people!
A ticket and a mint, which we encourage
each and every single one of you to use!
Just gonna be $5.
All sales and epic smooches are final!
As you may have noticed, there's
a slight twist to this kissing booth.
The people you will be kissing
are blindfolded!
First up, for the ladies.
The one and only Ollie!
All right!
And for the guys,
the breathtakingly hot Olivia!
Alrighty, let's do this thing!
- I'll take that.
- Thank you! A great smootch!

- Yeah!
But we do have one problem.
The girls are asking for Flynn,
and I have a solution.
Alrighty!
As promised, the next kisser is Flynn!
Hold on. That is not Flynn.
That is Lee Flynn.
The only reason I ever talked to that dork
was to make sure he'd get his brother
to come to the booth tonight.
Let's go.
I guess I'm next.
Oh.
I hope you like what you see.
Hey, Elle.
So, we're gonna hang out now.
Oh, but there's another hour left.
Okay.
Yeah.
Just don't do anything I wouldn't do.
All right, see you later.
Rule number 18: always be happy
for your bestie's successes.
For me, that one has always
been easy to follow.
No ways!
I can't.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Ew!
Imagine having to kiss that!
I can't do it! Not with him!
- Gross.
- It's payback time for lying about Flynn.
- Who? Who's out there?
- It's Olivia's ex.
And the problem is
we're all really good friends.
Right, Olivia?
Oh!
- Yeah.Totally.
- Yeah.
Say, Elle,
you don't know Olivia's ex at all, do you?
- No, well...
- Then it's solved!
Oh, no, Mia, please!
I don't think this is a good idea.
- Cutsies?
- What?
Cutsies.
- No, Mia!
- Time to get your dirty-girl on!
Thanks, dude.
Guys, I've never...
Sorry.
Oh, muscles!
Sorry. Okay. Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Sorry. I know that you were
probably expecting Olivia, so we don't
have to do anything if you don't want to.
Truth be told,
I've never kissed anyone before.
It's not that I haven't wanted to,
don't get me wrong.
For example, I punched Ron Getler
in the sixth grade
during Seven Minutes in Heaven.
Sophomore year, Spring Fling,
I was dancing with Randy Melrose.
You know, a romantic song came on.
I was like, "Oh, it's gonna happen!"
But... until...
it just didn't, cause...
This isn't so bad.
Not so bad at all.
Wait!

Everyone... everyone just saw that,

Yup. Pretty much.
Oh, my God! Kill me now!
Come on. Relax, Shelly.
It was just a kiss.
Was it, Noah? Was it just a kiss?
Yeah. Of course.
All right.
So I'll... I'll see you around.
Noah! Noah! Noah!
Keep up the good work, huh?
"Good word?" What the...?
Oh.
"Good work."
And then it hit me.
Holy crap! What am I going to tell Lee?
That was really close.
Hey.
Oh, hey. I'll be right back, okay?
Oh! That was really close!
- Hey.
- Hey. Is everything okay?
Yeah, the booth is crushing it!
We have made more
than all the other booths combined.
- No way!
- It turns out people
really like to kiss!
What?
And get this:
I even wound up kissing your brother!
What?
Come on, Lee. It's no big deal. Seriously.
What?
It's for charity, right?
Yeah...
I guess so.
Just don't end up grinding coochies
with my brother,
or I'll literally never talk to you again.
That and Rule Number Nine, of course.
Of course! Right.
Come on, Lee. Seriously. As if.
As I ran home,
I wondered if our kiss
meant anything to Noah.
If I meant anything.
How about a ride?
Come on, Shelly.
You know my mom will kill me
if I leave you out here.
Holding on to Noah,
I couldn't stop thinking
about the promise I had made to Lee.
It's getting too dangerous.
I'm pulling over.
But who knows if Noah
even wanted to kiss me again.
That didn't really matter though.
Because I still wanted to kiss him.
You know, if we wait out this rain,
we should be fine.
Wait, no.
I cannot just be
another one of your conquests.
Is that what you think of me?
It's what everyone thinks of you.
You want to know the truth?
You are the only girl
who doesn't fall at my feet.
And it is driving me crazy.
It's one of the things I like about you.
You're sweet.
But you're not afraid
to call me out on things.
And here I was thinking I was just
your brother's annoying best friend.
Well, yeah. There's that too.
Look, I don't know what all this means.
I just like hanging out with you.
It feels right.
I'm just...
I'm so confused right now.
Did that clear anything up?
No, I think we'd better try again.
- Security.
- Oh, my God! We're gonna die!
Is that you, Flynn?
I thought I told you not to bring girls
around here anymore.
What?
You just took me to your hookup spot?
No! You know what? Unbelievable!
Thanks, Andrew.
Still mad at you, but I am cold as shit!
And you are taking me home.
Now!
Thanks for the ride.
You know, I meant when I said, Elle.
Good for you.
So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Why didn't Lee give you
a ride home tonight?
Um...
He just got busy.
But that is the only reason
you're on the back
of Noah Flynn's motorcycle, right?
Of course. Duh. Come on.
In spite of what happened tonight,
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Noah said to me.
And even though I know I shouldn't,
how much I wanted to believe him.
Rule Number Six.
If you can't tell your best friend
about something you're doing,
you probably shouldn't be doing it.

Oh, um...
Thanks.
We never did get to finish
your skinny dip at Flynn's party.
Oh, um...
I was just way too drunk that night, so...
- You know what you need?
- Hmm?
Hot tub. Come on.
Oh, no, that's okay, Warren.
- Come on, Evans. It'll be nice.
- No, Warren.
- Evans, come on! Don't make me beg.
- Warren?
- I'm not feeling well, Warren.
- She said no, Warren!
Okay. That's okay.
Okay. I'm fine.
It's all right. Can we... Can you just
take me home, please?
Okay. Just walk away. Hey, just walk away.
Let's go.
Hey, come on, man. It's all good.
I guess I'd also be pretty pissed
if I was slumming it
with my little brother's sloppy seconds.
Oh, shit!
Elle, wait!
Wait!
Elle!
Just get in the car, Elle.
Just get in the car, Elle.
Get in the car, Elle!
Please.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
What do you think? You think I meant
to fall for my brother's best friend?
Wait, this isn't the way home.
I want to show you something.
How many girls have you made out with
in this spot?
I only come here alone.
Until now.
Oh, you are good!
That sounds so great when you say it.
You must know that, right?
Such a player.
You haven't changed.
I mean, what is the difference
between what just happened...
The difference is you.
You're crazy.
I'm crazy about you, Elle.
He is good.
Okay.
Okay.
Here's how this is gonna work.
Rules. Number one:
No more fighting.
Done.
Number two:
No more telling me what to do.
Cross my heart.
And number three:
If we do this, nobody can know.
Okay? At least until...
I figure out a way to tell Lee.
It has to be that way.
You know, you're cute when you're bossy.
- I'm serious, Noah.
- So am I.
You're really, really cute!
Promise.
Hey.
I promise.
Um...
You know, we don't have to.
You know when the time is right.
And this was our time.
Noah and his stupid, sexy smirk
got the best of me.
And I was happy about it.
But now what am I going to do?
This is all your fault, kissing booth!
Nope. No. Nope. Never work.
What's wrong?
We're supposed to be
in a logistics meeting right now. Okay?
We're trying to figure out
how not to get caught.
I don't see what the big deal is.
It's not like anyone's gonna think
that I have a girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, God forbid anyone
actually thinks you're in a relationship.
Hey! I have my reputation to think of.
Is that so?
- Oh, 'tis so!
- Really?
Shit! Hide!
- Just a minute.
- I need to get your laundry.
Go, go down there.
Yeah! Just one second, Mom!
Hold on.
Yup, come in
Ew!
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Mom.
You know, I could have brought
the laundry down.
It's okay. I have an hour to kill before
your dad and I will meet the Andersons.
Oh, no.
Shit!
Oh, and by the way, don't forget.
We're going out on Saturday
to celebrate your big news.
- We don't have to, Mom.
- Of course, we do.
It's not every day you get accepted
to an Ivy League school.
Oh! And I invited the Evanses.
Do me a favor.
Be sweet to Elle.
She kind of has a crush on you.
Really? I had no idea.
Of course you didn't. Boys never do.
Shut up!
Elle has a crush on you.
She's not even supposed to be here.
I have to be downstairs in ten minutes
and work on the prom banner with Lee.
Um...
So, Ivy League school, huh?
It's not a big deal.
Which school?
Harvard.
Are you shitting me?
That's amazing!
I don't even know
if I'm gonna go or not yet.
Listen, you can't tell anybody
about this, okay?
And that was the first time it hit me.
Noah would be leaving for college. Soon.
But we need to get you out of here,
and lucky for you,
I've got your escape route
all figured out.
Okay.
You've got to be kidding me.
Or we could just go tell Lee now.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Are you still wearing your clothes?
Um... yes.
Oh. Okay. I'll be down in a second.
Okay.
Geronimo!
Oh, hey, I think you got a text
from someone.
- I'll see who it is.
- That's okay. I got it.
Lee, I said I'll get it.
Why, is it from a boy?
Yeah, right.
Since when do you have a lock
on your phone?
Um... little bro keeps getting into it.
Hmm.

Hey, this is great. I really needed this.
Yeah, we really haven't been
hanging out much, right?
You've been, like,
acting really weird recently.
Wait.
Is this because
you don't have a date to prom?
Because if that's it,
you can come with Rachel and I.
Um.
Stop lying to your best friend.
It's time.
Lee, there is something
I wanted to tell you.
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, you made it!
- Sorry. Traffic was crazy.
- Hey!
Hey!
So, it's okay if Elle comes to prom
with us, right?
Absolutely! The more, the merrier!
See?
So, what was it you were saying?
Oh, nothing.
It was about prom. So...
- Okay. Off. My turn.
- Bully!
Stupid.
I swear to God. Says it right here.
It's so her!
Hey, could you pass me the wrench, please?
The little black tool box
on top of the shelf.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Elle!
When'd you become such a doctor?
Since I started getting into fights.
You kind of learn to take care of yourself
when that happens.
Why do you get in all those fights anyway?
I think I...
I guess it's kind of just how I'm wired.
I don't believe that.
My parents even sent me to see
a couple of counselors.
But you know, we're all fucked up
one way or another, right?
You could change.
You think I can change?
You're Noah Flynn.
I don't think there's much you can't do.
Hey, Noah, have you seen Elle?
Hey.
What's going on in here?
Jesus! What happened your face?
Oh, I had an accident
and Noah offered to help.
- Did you do that to her?
- What did you just say?
I said did you do that to her?
Did you hit Elle?
- You really think I'd hit her?
- I wouldn't put it past you.
Hey, no. Lee, I'm fine.
I just tripped in the garage.
I was looking for you.
You really expect me to believe
that she just tripped?
- Get a clue, Lee! You weren't even here!
- I swear to God,
- if you laid a hand on her....
- All right, that's it!
Noah! Hey! Stop! Noah! Stop!
Look at me. Noah, look at me!
Come on.
Is there something going on
between you two?
What?
No, nothing is going on.
Okay.
Fine.
But I really need to get out of here.
Do you want to go downstairs
and start the car?
I just need to grab my things.
Look, I have to tell him tonight.
Yeah.
It's time.
That way I can take you to prom.
What the fuck?
Lee, I can explain.
Unbelievable.
Wait, no. Lee. Lee, wait.
Wait, Noah. Stay here, please.
Let me handle this.
Lee!
Lee, wait!
Lee, wait! Wait.
So this is what you've been
keeping from me?
You were never meant to find out this way.
Seems I was never meant to find out
at all, doesn't it?
Hey, lay off her, Lee.
It's not like it's all Elle's fault.
You! Don't even get me started
on you, okay?
Telling other guys to stay away from Elle
to protect her.
And there you are, treating her like
some slut that you picked up at the club.
You have no idea
what you're talking about.
So you're trying to tell me
that you two have not slept together.
I knew it.
So you really just have been fucking
my brother and lying to me.
- No.
- Okay, Lee. That is enough.
No, it's not enough. She has no clue
what she's gotten herself into with you!
This is bullshit.
You're acting like a hurt, little bitch.
- Noah, get off of him!
- Stop!
- Noah, get off of him!
- Calm down!
That is enough! Calm down! I'm not
letting you go until you chill out!
- Get off of me!
- Chill out!
- Get off!
- Get off him! Get off!
Please!
Stop!
Here.
Please.
Please, Lee!
Stop, Lee! Please!
Lee, please!
Please, Lee, don't leave like this.
So much for Rule Number Nine, huh?
I didn't mean for this to happen.
You know, my whole life,
Noah has gotten everything
that he has ever wanted.
The only thing that I had
that he didn't....
was you.
And now he has that too.
Lee.
It's okay.
You two deserve each other.
Elle.
Look, it's okay. He'll get over it.
Why? Why did you come downstairs?
I told you to stay inside!
Like you wanted to make things worse!
What is wrong with you?
You can not pin all this on me.
Just leave me alone.
No problem.
Some people say you'll fall in love.
And that's the person
you'll spend forever with.
They'll be the one who, no matter what,
you can't live without.
But at that moment
all I cared about was Lee.
And I was pretty sure
I'd lost him forever.
Hey.
Hey.
There's someone here to see you.
Lee?
Hi, Elle.
I was hoping maybe we could talk.
There's really nothing to talk about.
I'm just really sorry for lying to Lee
about Noah and...
Now I've ruined our friendship.
Elle, I was friends with your mom
for over 20 years.
She was my best, best friend.
But if you think
that we didn't fight sometimes,
you got another thing coming.
Really?
Sure.
But you know, I can't really remember
what a single fight was really about.
But what I do remember
is that we always forgave each other.
It doesn't really feel like that
right now.
Don't give up on him.
You're lucky if you can get even one
really good best friend in your life.
You just have to figure out
how to make it right.
I gotta admit, the next couple
of weeks were pretty lonely.
Noah was totally MIA.
His attendance at school got so bad,
he was in danger of not graduating.
Worst of all,
Lee was completely ignoring me.
At least Dad had forgiven me.
He even paid for my driving lessons.
Decided it was about time
I got my license.
Then one day it hit me.
Holy crap! Rule Number Seven!
No matter how mad you are
at your best friend,
you have to forgive them
if they give you ice cream.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Mr. Evans.
Where have you been, Noah?
I had to get away and think.
I'm...
I'm on my way home now.
Good.
Listen, Elle's not here.
I'm actually here to talk to you.
Oh?
I just...
I wanted to apologize.
About everything.
I shouldn't have let it happen.
It was all my fault.
Not Elle's.
But I'm not sorry that it did happen.
Or for the way that I feel
about your daughter.
Oh, Noah.
I can't say I support the two of you.
I can't.
But it's got to be Elle's choice.
I just think that Elle is gonna have
to figure out what's best for Elle.
I understand.

Hello, Los Angeles Country Day Prom!
Now, I'd like to introduce
this year's theme:
Memories.
Photographs which show
images of great moments
from a truly fantastic year.
The moments that stood out
and helped to define
who we are as a class.
It's a final look back on who we were,
at the very moment that we're looking
forward to who we want to become.
So, for everyone out there,
let's make this prom the very best!
Onward to Memory Lane!

It was at this exact moment
that I finally felt okay.
I wasn't thinking about Noah,
or Lee, or anybody.
I was a small part of something
that mattered.
The kissing booth
meant something to people.
It was gonna be remembered by everybody.
And that made me happy.
Until I saw him.

I just...
I can't keep hurting people
that I care about because of you.
Okay? Nobody wants us to be together.
Well, that may be true.
But what do you want?
I want...
I want to go.
Elle.
Hey, Elle! Wait up!
Hey.
Hey.
Listen.
I just came to say I'm sorry about
what happened on the lawn the other day.
And for everything with Elle.
I never should have been lying to you.
But I wanted you to know that...
I was never playing Elle.
And I meant everything
that I said to her tonight.
And not that you care,
but I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
I figured I'd try to get settled in
before the fall term. You know?
All right.
Well, I'll see you around, eh?
Oh, and...
Happy birthday, man.
Rachel's getting here in ten minutes.
Is Noah gonna be here tonight?
He told me last night
he was leaving for Harvard today.
He just didn't want to be around here.
But hey, it's for the best.
I mean, I think you did the right thing.
Don't you?
Yeah.
So, what'd you wish for?
No, you know the rules.
Rule Number One:
Only your best friend
gets to know your birthday wishes.
So, how about you?
No wish this year.
Okay.
Hey!
Where you going?
I can't keep doing this.
Doing what?
Elle, what's wrong?
Hey!
You're acting all weird.
I love you.
And I always, always
want to be close to you.
But being my best friend
doesn't give you the right
to tell me who I can love.
It's like with Rachel.
What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?
- I guess I'd break up with her.
- No, you see?
You shouldn't have to do that just
because I didn't want you to be with her.
No. Come on, Elle.
This isn't the same thing as with Noah
and you know that.
Okay. Listen to me, Lee.
We made up our rules when we were six.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that I love Noah.
And I want him.
And I'm sorry if that hurts you,
and I'm so sorry
that I lied to you before.
I was wrong.
But I'd be lying to you again
if I didn't tell you that I love him
with every bit of my heart.
And if you just can't accept that,
then...
Then maybe you can't be part of my life.
I think you're making a big mistake.
Then that's my decision to make.
You're right.
I love you, Elle,
and I just want you to be happy.
Thank you!
Okay.
I have to find him. Like now.
It's okay. I'll help you find him, okay?
Okay, let me go just make sure
my dad knows where I'm going, okay?
Meet you outside in five,
and you can drive the Stang.
- Thank you. I love you so much! Thank you!
- Go!
Here we go!
Thank you for doing this, by the way.
No problem.
You know,
I think the hardest part
was just seeing Noah's face at prom.
Gosh, I wish I had just told him then.
But you know what? No matter
how he feels now, I've just gotta find him
and tell him how I feel.
You just did.
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jesus, woman! Pull over!
Pull over! Pull the car over!
- My God! You're trying to kill us!
- Oh, my God!
I was not expecting that!
Oh, my God! Like, what?
Hi!
I thought you were leaving
for Harvard.
Yeah, I was planning to, but...
I decided I had to see you
one last time before I went.
Noah.
And then Lee came upstairs
and he told me everything.
And the old switcheroo was his idea?
- It was like a classic Lee, huh?
- Yeah!
He said something
about Rule Number 18 or whatever.
Rule Number 18:
Always be happy
for your bestie's successes.
Yeah. Classic Lee.
Thanks for staying a little longer.
Well, I had to see you blow out
the candles on your cake.
Happy birthday to me.
So, what about Harvard?
I don't want to talk about that right now.
You know, I want to know what it was
that you wanted to tell me.
Um...
Sitting here in front of...
no one in particular,
I'm saying I love you.
And I love you.
The next few weeks
before Noah left for school
we spent every spare minute together...
up to the very last second.
Goodbye.
Come on, Shelly. Don't say it like that.
I'll see you soon,
and you can come and visit.
- And we can make this work.
- Okay, stop.
Don't say anything.
I just want to be with you
for a few seconds more.
You are cute when you're being bossy!
And don't turn back for a final wave.
That is way too cheesy and romantic.
Even for me.
Okay.
See you.
Maybe things really would work out
with Noah.
I hoped they would.
But maybe they wouldn't.
And no matter how much I wanted it,
things couldn't stay
the way they were forever.
But whatever happened,
I knew there was a part of me
that was always
going to belong to Noah Flynn.
A little piece of my heart
that would always be Noah's.
And for the first time,
everything suddenly seemed...
possible.
But it's funny when I think about it.
Because all this happened
just because of a kissing booth.

Oh, come on.
Sounds so tawdry when you put it that way,

Boobies. My answer

I'm just not really sure
if I like that one more or that one.
