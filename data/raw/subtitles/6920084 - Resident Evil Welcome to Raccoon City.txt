No, thanks. If I want to look at pictures,
I go to Fotomat.
Besides, Rose brought me.
She's waiting outside with the dog.
Hey, you ever stick your head
out of a car window doing 50?
What a rush.
Friend?
Hello?
What do you want?
She's here again.
She was watching me.
Try and get back to sleep
before Doctor Birkin finds you in my bed.
I saw her.
You didn't...
You didn't see anything.
You didn't see anything.
Close your eyes.
What are you, a pervert?
I was married for 45 years,
I never even saw my husband's Gaugins!
Hello?
What's your name?
"Lisa Trevor"?
Do you live here?
Where do you live?
"Below"?
Hey.
What are you doing out of bed,
little girl?
Well?
She sleepwalks sometimes
since our parents died.
Well then...
Off to bed, both of you.
Wait.
"Redfield," isn't it?
Chris and Claire Redfield?
You're a good boy
for taking such care of your sister.
Good night.
Good night.
That must've been quite some dream.
I almost shit my goddamn pants.
If I knew
you'd be screaming in your sleep,
I would've left you
at the side of the road.
What are you doing out hitchhiking
on a night like this anyway?
Oh, yeah.
Going to see your brother,
you said. Right.
Used to live here, you said.
Raccoon City.
Better you than me.
You know, one might have nightmares
heading back into that shithole town.
Nothing left except the raccoons
since Umbrella started to leave.
You mind?
You know, you should tell your brother...
"Just get out of there.
Just pack up and leave."
Although,
who you're gonna sell your house to?
Nobody, that's who.
Live in Raccoon?
No, thanks. No way.
Maybe you wanna stay on till Gatlin.
Tell him you had a change of heart.
People put too much emphasis
on family anyway.
–Sometimes, you just gotta let it go.
–Watch out!
Shit!
Is she...?
Oh, no, no, no.
Fuck!
I didn't see her.
She came out of nowhere.
What's she doing out here
in the middle of the night?
I need something to wrap the body in.
You saw it, right? It wasn't my fault.
Jesus. Oh, fuck, fuck!
Listen to me.
We need something to wrap the body in,
and then we're gonna take it into town.
It wasn't my fault!
Oh, Jesus! Fuck!
–My brother's a cop. He can help us.
–Cop?
But it's not my fault! It's not my fault!
I know. I know.
Fuck! Fuck!
We can't just leave her here, okay?
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!
Where the fuck did she go?
Hello?
Hey!
You've been in an accident
and you need help!
We need to go after her.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.
I'm getting the fuck outta here.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Why don't you just take a seat
and leave the poor kid alone, Wesker?
Okay.
Ten bucks.
Ten bucks says
you can't shoot that off from here.
Well, that's easy.
Jesus fucking Christ.
With this, Valentine.
I mean, what the fuck?
Twenty says I can knock the bottle
without even looking.
I mean, yeah, sure, I'll take your money.
What the fuck?
Fuck.
–Hey.
–You snooze, you lose.
–What...
–It's Jill's sandwich now.
Hey. Oh, God.
Come on.
Pay up.
Come on, pay up.
Shit.
Fellas.
You back there, Louise?
Hello, boys. What can I get ya?
Two coffees to go.
–Long day?
–Uh–huh.
–Hey, could I...
–Oh, you must be the rookie.
How you doin', rookie?
So, I heard...
that you shot your partner in the ass
during training. Is that true?
And that your...
daddy is some big shot on the force
and he had to bail you out.
Now, is that why they transferred you
to this shithole town?
–Yeah.
–Leon S. Kennedy.
What's the "S" stand for? "Stupid"?
Come on, just playing with you, kiddo.
Yeah. Good.
Y'all working the graveyard?
Yep. Where you guys headed?
Well, someone found a body
up at the old Spencer Mansion.
It's all chewed up.
Didn't think there was anything
up there anymore.
Well, the sooner they shut this whole town
down, the better, as far as I'm concerned.
Hey, hey.
It's my hometown you're talking about.
Well, you're welcome to it.
Hey, come on, we gotta shake a leg.
And don't shoot. I'm unarmed.
Fuck that guy.
All right. So, I guess I'm paying?
Come on, we should get to the station.
Hey. Pay us no mind, we're...
nice people once you get to know us.
I'm Jill Valentine.
Leon Kennedy.
Nice to meet you...
Leon Kennedy.
I wouldn't go there.
She only got eyes for the big fella.
And I don't fancy your chances
against him.
You really shoot your own partner?
Yeah. It's a long story.
What's goin' on with your eye?
I don't know, it's been doing that
the last couple of weeks.
You don't think you should see someone
about that?
Yeah.
It's probably nothing.
Would you look at that?
Hey, that...
that woman...
that probably just wasn't as bad
as it seemed, right?
Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the ride.
Welcome home.
What's goin' on with you?
Don't go getting ill on me,
you son of a bitch.
I don't have insurance for ya.
Fuck!
You fuckin' bit me, you motherfucker!
Still pining after Jill, I see.
Never gonna happen, bro.
He's been like a father to me.
I see you wax your chest now.
Funny.
After you ran away...
William was the closest thing
I had to family.
How'd you get in?
Picked your lock.
–You realize I'm a cop, right?
–Yeah.
You need better security.
It's a single–cylinder deadbolt, Claire.
Most people knock.
Yeah, I tried. No one answered.
So you broke in.
Why are you back here?
Missed Raccoon City so much
you had to come pay me a visit?
Yeah, I fuckin' love Raccoon City.
"Go, you Bandits."
You're an asshole.
No, you know what?
I owe this town,
I owe Birkin and Umbrella everything.
They raised me, put me through school,
the academy...
they were there for me.
Where were you?
I haven't even heard from you
in five years.
Nice seein' ya.
Chris, wait.
I'm sorry. I'm back now.
Look...
I think there's something seriously wrong
with this place.
What do you mean?
Okay, so, I was hitching a ride
in a truck, and...
Soliciting a ride, also illegal.
Arrest me.
Look, we kinda hit this person,
but they just got up and they walked away.
You hit someone?
Holy shit, Claire. Have you reported it?
I'm reporting it now.
Are you not listening to me?
They just got up and walked off.
You could be party to a hit and run.
Shush. Just...
No, Claire, I don't have time for this.
No. Look, okay, so, I've been talking
to this guy in a chatroom...
What the fuck's a chatroom?
It's a place on the internet
where people chat.
Just watch it.
His name's Ben Bertolucci.
It's in the water, Claire.
It's in the fuckin' water.
This whole town's been poisoned.
Slowly, over years and years, and...
people are getting sick.
Come on, Claire. Not again.
–Shh.
–You shh.
See, Umbrella just thought
that they could pack up shop
and let this town rot away
while they go off and start afresh
somewhere else, all shiny and new.
And they almost fuckin' did it.
But a couple days ago,
they had a little incident.
And I'm not just talking about waste
poisoning the water.
No, I'm talking about a real bad leak.
Like Chernobyl, if you know what I mean.
And they've been trying
to contain that shit,
but the genie is out of the bottle now
and I don't think it's going back in.
I'm afraid, Claire.
I'm afraid of what they're gonna do
to this town...
and the people in it.
I've not been able
to make contact with him since.
Great.
He's crazy and probably dangerous.
Look, your conspiracy theories
weren't true when we were kids,
they're not true now.
All right? Why are you really here?
Did you lose your job? Do you need cash?
You show up here, you break into my house.
What kind of person
can pick a lock like that?
It's kind of impressive, but also,
what the fuck?
I'm sorry, I gotta get ready for work.
Chris...
Oh, fuck.
Honey, hey, Mom and Dad are here.
I saw a monster.
Honey, you just had a bad dream.
But I did see him.
He was all green and slimy
and he had big yellow eyes
and teeth, like this.
I think I'd be frightened, too.
Right, honey?
–Oh, my gosh, I'd be petrified.
–Terrified.
Come on, it's okay.
I'd never let anything hurt you.
–I'll be right back, okay?
–Okay.
All right,
let's get you back to sleep, okay?
But wait,
what if the monster comes back?
Hello?
Honey, there's no such thing
as monsters, okay?
–Do you promise?
–I promise.
...with really good thoughts.
So let's do that, okay?
Remember last time we went swimming.
Okay? All right? Think about that.
–We need to go.
–What are you talking about?
–Who was on the telephone?
–Now!
What is happening, William?
Get Sherry dressed and meet me at the car.
Okay. Hey, look at me, look at me...
This is the Umbrella Corporation.
For your safety, please stay in your homes
and await further instructions.
This is the Umbrella Corporation.
For your safety, please stay in your homes
and await further instructions.
This is the Umbrella Corporation.
What is that?
It's nothing. It's nothing.
I gotta get to the station.
Here, it's not much.
–What?
–Just take it, okay?
Lock–pick the door behind you
when you leave.
Chris. Chris!
Just get outta here. Okay?
And don't touch the bike!
This is the Umbrella Corporation.
For your safety, please stay in your homes
and await further instructions.
Why aren't you sick, big brother?
Can I help you?
Hello?
Hey, do you need help?
You need help.
Itchy tasty!
This is the Umbrella Corporation.
For your safety, please stay in your homes
and await further instructions.
This is the Umbrella Corporation.
For your safety, please stay in your homes
and await further instructions.
What would the worst way to die be?
What?
To be swallowed whole by a snake, or...
eaten alive by a great white shark?
You're a freak, Valentine.
I plan on dying peacefully...
in bed snuggled in Wesker's big,
burly arms.
–Yeah.
–Me, too, brother.
What's Vickers doing here?
Thought we lost the chopper
with the rest of the budget cuts.
Maybe he just missed us.
Fuck you.
Is that right?
Guess not.
–Hey!
–Okay, Chief, what's this all about?
Yeah, what's with the alarm?
Well, if you all shut the hell up
for a second and listen...
maybe you'll find out.
Honestly, I don't know.
–You don't know?
–That's right, Redfield. I do not know.
What I do know is that Marini and Dooley
are currently not answering their radios.
They're investigating a report of a body
up by the Spencer Mansion.
You think it's connected?
What's a Spencer Mansion?
Well, as I think most of you know,
Oswald Spencer was the creator
of the Umbrella Corporation
and the mansion was his home
until the year of his death in...
What the fuck are you doing here, Leon?
You said everyone into the briefing room,
so, here I am.
I didn't mean you, you moron!
Not you, Leon! Everyone else!
What if someone wanders in
and there's no one behind the front desk?
An old lady's looking
for a cat or something.
Okay. Yeah, you're right.
–Jesus Christ. Get back there, man.
–You're right.
And get a haircut, you goddamn hippie.
It's not Woodstock.
Take it easy on the rook, chief.
I'm sorry, Wesker. Is that important?
No, I'm good.
A new girlfriend?
Maybe you could take her out to eat
at Planet Hollywood.
They have a new one in Gatlin.
They got a great salad.
A little wine.
Or maybe just take her back
to your apartment.
Rent a movie at Blockbuster,
get cozy on the couch.
Put on some Journey.
Steve Perry's voice, what it does
to a woman's heart, am I right?
How's that sound?
Sounds like I might be getting laid.
But it ain't gonna happen tonight, because
I want you dressed in five, all of you,
and ready to fly, because I wanna know
where the hell Bravo team is
and what the fuck all those alarms
are about! You got me?
Come on, get movin'. Go.
Let's go.
Get a move on it!
Yeah.
Hey, I'll meet you guys in the chopper.
What the fuck is this?
Wesker, let's get going.
Slow down, William. You're gonna crash.
William, slow down!
Where are we going?
Why can't you tell me
why we're in such a hurry to leave?
Leaving, that's what they want.
So they can destroy my life's work.
Daddy, watch out!
You almost hit that girl.
You okay?
Wake up. Wake up.
We need you to get up and come with us.
Where are we going?
It's okay, little girl.
Because we have found you a new family.
They're waiting for you just outside.
It's all so very exciting.
Don't worry about your brother.
He'll be coming along as well,
in due course.
We would never separate the two of you.
We just need you to come with us
and someone will collect
all of your belongings.
William!
What the fuck?
You might wanna get a fire extinguisher.
And lock the gates, there may be others.
Other what?
Fuck this.
Hi, sir, what's goin' on? Because...
Should we call someone?
Who you gonna call? You're the police.
An ambulance?
Look, I'm no medical expert,
but I think that guy
might just be beyond saving.
Besides, I think you'll find that
all the phone lines in the city are dead.
Take care of yourself, Leon.
Fuck. Fuck.
Sir? Hey, hey! Sir!
Where are you going, sir?
Shit.
Hey, hey...
Hey, sir, I know I'm new here
and I don't really know
what's going on, but...
So, where are you going?
Who's in charge now?
You are.
No, no, no. I'm a rookie, right?
Yeah, well, congratulations, rookie,
on the promotion.
I'm sure your father
would be incredibly proud
that his pathetic specimen of a son
is rising so quickly through the ranks.
Sir, I really don't think you should go.
I don't think I'm prepared to handle...
I'm goin'. At ease, take care, good luck.
I know you'll do a great job.
Sir.
Sir!
Fuck.
Right here.
Radio Irons.
Tell him we found Bravo team's jeep.
Will do.
Holy shit.
Jesus Christ. What the hell happened here?
Where are they?
What the fuck?
What the fuck is wrong with it?
Really?
What?
Someone should confiscate that.
Just...
Hey, guys.
They went this way.
Marini and Dooley are in here somewhere.
We should split up.
What?
The faster we find them,
the faster we can get the fuck outta here.
All right, we go in pairs.
I'll go with you, Wesker.
Keep your shit wired at all times.
Oh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight...
This is not good.
This is the Umbrella Corporation.
Return to your vehicles
and return to your homes and businesses.
Hey!
Come on! Go back!
Go back! Move your truck back.
We're blocked in!
How much longer is this gonna be?
Guys, I gotta get to work.
Don't move.
Oh, damn, damn it!
Oh, damn, damn, damn.
Open up! Come on, please!
Get off! Get the fuck away from my car!
Get off, Jack! Get off!
Fuck. Oh, goddamn!
Oh, man!
That was close!
Oh, shit!
Raccoon City, locked down and secured.
Please let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Help, please.
Come on, come on.
Goddamn bullets. Come on.
Fuck!
Drop your gun! Show me your hands!
Haven't got a gun.
Who the fuck are you?
Come on.
Leon, put that gun down.
Sir, are you in charge again?
Please let me in. Let me in!
Where's my brother, Chris Redfield?
So, you're Chris's little sister, huh?
I didn't think the two of you spoke.
He's up in the Arklay Mountains
with the rest of Alpha team.
Hey, sorry, does someone wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on here?
What's happening to them?
Let me in.
Clearly, some bad shit.
All the exits out of Raccoon
have been blocked by Umbrella.
We need more ammo and guns.
The armory's downstairs.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna try and get a hold
of your brother.
There's no way out of Raccoon by road,
but we might just be able
to take a helicopter.
What is that?
I'll explain in a minute.
Hey. R.P.D.
Help me.
Hands. Show me your hands.
What the fuck?
I need you to stay right there.
Oh, fuck.
Marini, fuck. Hey.
Okay, here, here, here.
Put pressure right there, okay?
As much pressure as you can.
Find Dooley.
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You'll be fine.
This is nothing.
Shit. Oh, God.
Shit. Shit.
Just hold on, man, all right?
Fuck. Shit. No, no, no.
Dooley.
Richard!
Redfield!
Aiken!
Let's get the fuck out of here!
–The fuck you doin', Wesker?
–Hold on.
Listen, do you hear that?
What the hell is Vickers doing?
Run!
Okay.
Yeah, I've actually never been
in this room, so...
That's good, right?
I think it's just... sort of jammed.
Here.
Put this on.
So, how do you know so much about guns?
My parents died in a car accident
when I was eight.
My brother and I grew up
in the orphanage here.
I ran away a long time ago.
I had to learn to handle myself quickly.
Right, yeah.
You're probably wondering
what a guy like me
is doing as a cop, right?
Kind of.
Yeah, me too.
Hey! Someone get me out of here!
Hello?
You're a police station.
I'll see what else I can find.
Yeah.
I'm in the fucking basement.
They put me in the fucking basement.
Get me outta here.
I know you're up there.
Oh, thank God.
Thank fucking God.
You gotta get me outta here, man.
Who the fuck are you?
Well, how about I tell you
once you get me the fuck outta here?
Jesus.
Is he okay?
Him?
Oh, yeah, no, he's fuckin' fine. Yeah.
Yeah, who doesn't cough up a little blood
on the floor when they're feeling sick?
Just a little cold.
Of course he's not fuckin' okay, man.
Look at him.
Open the goddamn door.
Why are you locked up?
Why? Because I found out the truth.
The truth? What truth?
Listen to me,
you fuckin' boy band wannabe.
You think Umbrella spend all their time
makin' aspirins and vitamin tablets?
No fuckin' way.
Jesus Christ. Hey!
–That's... my gun.
–Open the goddamn door.
–Do it.
–You don't have to do this.
Sure I don't.
You and all your police buddies,
you're not sick like the rest of the town
just 'cause you got
a good immune system, right?
Fuck, you probably had a little injection,
a little vitamin pill
you didn't even realize.
Keeps you safe, at least for a while.
But the others, ordinary people...
expendable ones...
Yeah, good fuckin' luck, right?
Open the goddamn door.
The keys are over there on the desk.
Do it, go!
Okay, okay, okay. Here I go. Okay.
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
Come on, man.
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Hurry up.
Oh, fuck me.
Have you ever heard of the T–Virus?
And the G–virus?
Of course you fuckin' haven't.
Well, it's a virus
that genetically modifies
the DNA of a living cell,
and it's turning these people
into fuckin' weapons, man.
So you need to get me
the fuck outta here, okay?
Be an asshole about it.
Yeah, well, I'm done taking chances.
Fuck.
Come on, man. Jesus fuckin' Christ.
All right. You know what?
Just one second, please.
You're no Einstein, are you, buddy?
Thank fucking God. Oh, Jesus.
Fuck!
Shit!
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
Wait, just slow down.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait!
Hey.
Ben.
Get your shit together or you're not
gonna make it through the night.
Oh, fuck.
Are you done?
I just really wanna get out of this town
Vickers, can you read me? Over.
Vickers, this is Chief Irons,
pick up your damn radio!
Vickers, can you read me? Over.
Vickers, this is Irons.
Pick up your damn radio.
Hey.
Holy shit.
You saved my life.
Oh, shit.
Come on. Come on, come on.
Holy shit, she was telling the truth.
Truth about what?
Wesker, what's going on?
They contacted me several months ago.
It was once Umbrella started moving
their operations out of Raccoon.
I don't know who they are.
I don't know and I don't care.
They're just some people
with a vested interest in...
getting hold of whatever dirty secrets
Umbrella are keeping down there
and exposing them.
What are you talking about?
Come on, Jill, don't look at me like that.
It's just money, all right.
And they have plenty of it.
It was just a way of getting out of...
this small–town dead–end life.
So...
...you were just gonna leave us.
Come on.
We have to find Chris and Richard,
and tell them that Vickers is dead.
Come on.
Come on, these are your friends!
I can't.
What are you...
Oh, my God.
What the fuck happened to him?
I don't know.
Wesker. Wesker!
Did you get a hold of my brother?
No.
We need that helicopter to get outta here.
We need to get to the Arklay Mountains.
How?
I think I know a way. Come on.
Oh, shit.
Come on!
The loading dock's this way.
Shit.
Let's go. Let's go.
Go, go!
Come on, come on, come on.
What are we doing here?
We need you to get up and come with us.
Where are we going?
Hey. Why are we here?
This place has a secret passageway
that leads to the Spencer mansion.
How'd you know about this place?
They bought you off, didn't they?
They paid you to keep quiet about
all the shit they were doing in here.
And now, they've left you to rot here
just like us.
Fuck!
Guys?
Look.
Guys!
What the fuck?
No, there was someone there.
–Run!
–Come on!
Go!
Shit.
Lisa Trevor.
We need to get to the Spencer Mansion.
You know how, don't you?
Friend?
Come on.
Why are we going in here?
I want my brother.
She bit my hand.
Get her.
Key.
The second key.
Go to...
Key. Key. Key.
Thank you.
Claire.
You got some weird friends.
Fuck.
Dooley?
Fuck.
We have to get to the helicopter.
Where's Wesker?
The helicopter crashed. Vickers is dead.
–Wesker betrayed us, Chris.
–What?
He was gonna leave us here to die.
We have to follow him,
I think it's our only way outta here.
What is this place?
What were Umbrella doing here?
This is where they were bringing the kids
from the orphanage.
They were experimenting on 'em.
This is where they tried to bring me.
Claire. It's okay.
No!
It's okay.
Let's go find my brother.
It's okay.
William, what have you been doing
down here?
God's work.
William.
Hey. How did you get down...?
No, no, no.
Listen, I've just come for that.
This is my life's work.
I'm not giving it to anybody.
I'm not really offering
you a choice here, pal.
Okay, wait. Just put the gun down.
Just put it down.
Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter.
No, I don't suppose it does.
Daddy!
–No, no, no!
–Daddy!
God. Oh, God. Okay.
Vials.
Vials. Vials.
Hey! I need that.
Just hand me the vials.
Okay, don't do anything stupid,
lady, okay?
Fuck.
Where'd the kid go?
Kid?
Kid?
What the fuck?
You.
You didn't have to make it like this.
What the hell is wrong with you?
This is so fucked.
Hey. It's okay.
He killed them.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Jesus, Valentine,
you and that fucking gun.
Hey, no, no, no.
We're gonna get you out of here.
No, no, no. Jill, I fucked up.
Umbrella are gonna destroy this place.
All of Raccoon, okay?
There's a train tunnel
beneath this facility.
It leads to the other side
of the mountains and into Gatlin.
You need to get to that train.
You need to go now.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have pulled the trigger, kid.
No, no, no.
Wesker!
Come on, just through here.
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
Hide.
Come on. Go. Go.
Chris, come out and play.
Did you really believe
you could be part of my family?
Such a sweet little soldier.
Such a loyal little drone.
Where are you, Chris?
How could you be so dumb
when your sister's so smart?
You know...
I almost feel sad having to kill you.
Almost.
You know, I should have taken you
and your sister down to the lab.
You would have made excellent specimens.
Get...
...the fuck...
...away...
...from my brother.
Do it.
Chris... my boy.
Shut the fuck up.
I'm so glad you're okay.
This is really nice,
but I think I broke some ribs.
Oh, my God. Sorry. Are you hurt?
No, no, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.
We gotta get the fuck outta here.
Umbrella is gonna level this place.
Okay.
Hey.
–Rookie?
–Yeah.
Trust me,
I'm as surprised as you are, buddy.
Shall we go?
Let's go.
Come on!
Sit down.
–We'll get it started.
–Okay.
We only have five minutes left
until the place self–destructs.
How does it all work?
All right.
We're gonna get out of here.
I should have listened to you
a long time ago.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I may have scratched the paint
on your bike.
–Don't make me laugh.
–Sorry.
Oh, f––
Go get the others. I'll find a way out.
–You okay?
–Uh–huh.
Oh, my God. Sherry, get behind me.
Sherry, run!
Claire!
No!
Hey!
You ugly fuck!
Oh, shit.
A rocket launcher?
Found it in first class.
Holy shit.
What the fuck you guys do to this train?
Shit.
You're awake at last.
–Where am I?
–That doesn't matter.
Wait, I don't understand.
I thought I was dead.
You were.
My eyes.
What happened to my eyes? I can't see.
It's a side effect.
One of the things we had to do
to bring you back.
There will be others.
You never told me your name.
Ada.
My name is Ada Wong.
What do you want from me?
