Thank you, Brother Smith,
for that beautiful music.
Beautiful music.
And on the subject of music,
l have a few words
that l'd like to share
with all of you...
before we start the service.
Now, those of you
who have already seen
this morning's paper...
might suspect
that l am prompted
to these comments...
by what took place
in our town last night...
at the roller rink.
Friends, there is
a new form of music-
if you can call it music-
that is as un-Christian...
and un-American as anything
we have had to face
in the past 50 years!
[ Congregation Murmuring
ln Agreement ]
Now, this music,
this jungle rhythm,
this abandonment...
that seems so popular
with some of our children...
is a threat
to our morals.
Yea, l say that it is
in fact...
a threat
to our very society!
And l urge all you parents...
to do anything possible
to keep your children
far away...
from the disgraceful kinds
of goings-on...
which apparently follow on the heels
of this new music...
and of those who perform it!
For what we are about to
receive, O Lord, help us
be truly thankful. Amen.
Amen.

when you decided not
to go on to the seminary.

your wild oats

just what your plans
for the future are.

for over a year.

down around our ears.

that were there last night?

continuously for

"That'll Be The Day"
came up number one
in sales and requests...
all over Madman Mancuso land
this week.
You may not yet be a star,
but the Madman predicts
you are not very far.
What do you mean,
"That'll Be The Day"?
What's goin' on here?
- Who is this?
- This is your number-one
booster, rooster.
l'm the top jock in Buffalo,
and l'm turning the world on
to your sound.
Now, how about a few words
for your fans, the millions
of people listening right now?
- You— We're on the air?
- The Madman's listeners
would like to know...
how you get
that exciting sound?
What is the instrumentation
of your band?
Well, there's a guitar
and a set of drums...
and there's a stand-up base,
and there's a cricket
on the end of it.
So the name of your band
is the Crickets, huh?
Well, you ought to start
puttin' that on the label.
l'd love to continue
this conversation,
but duty calls.
l'm going for 24 hours nonstop
of "That'll Be The Day"
by Buddy Holly and the Crickets.
And thank you
for calling me all the way
from Lubbock, Montana.
No, that's Lubbock, Texas.

And tell the missus "hello."

[ Clears Throat ]

"That'll Be The Day"

for the three of you
should be around...
$75,000.
l think l can get you
part of that today.
75,000.
Come here.
Let's talk about this.
That's $75,000.
Boys, we'll have the best
producer in the business
doing your sessions.
Well, here we go again.
Um, l'm the producer
of the band.
l have complete say
about our music, and that's it.
Buddy, don't be silly.
No artist has ever been
his own producer.
Studio time
costs a lot of money.
Nobody ever gets
a record session handed to them
without supervision.
We've been down
the supervision road
in Nashville.
Yeah, it was awful, and l'm not
ever going to do it again.
Uh-uh.
But this is New York.
l simply can't put an artist
in charge of his own session.
Look, you may have had
problems in Nashville.
l guarantee you...
you'll have
no such problems here.
l guess we won't.
What do you say?
Let's go see R.C.A.
All right?
Excuse me.
Let's go, boys.
l'm going
to produce the records.
l don't give a shit, okay?
Uh, thank you
for the Coca-Cola
and the champagne.
The refreshments
was real nice.
Buddy, before you go,
please try to understand
the recording business
is a very complex affair.
Songwriters
come up with a song.
Arrangers decide
how the song will be done.
A performer is chosen
who is right for that song.
Finally, a producer"s charged
with putting all those elements
together in a studio.
l can't see
why you're so opposed
to having a seasoned pro...
in there with ya
getting the sound we all want.
Because he doesn't know
what it is, and l can't tell him.
That's why.
How's he going to produce
what l hear? lt starts with me.
Your complex system here—
Heck, it works fine
for you guys.
But we're a little band,
three pieces.
l write the songs.
There's no
formal arrangement.
We'll make a sound together,
and when it feels good,
we put it on a tape.
Now, if your producer
could do that, then you'd
owe him $75,000, not me.
ls that right?
- ls it right?
- Right.
Right. And nobody's going
to make us sound wrong again.
That's all l'm sayin'.
l'd rather shovel shit
in Lubbock. Excuse me.
Buddy, stay here
and make me some hits...
your way.
Okay. l'd be proud to.
Whoo-hoo!

but it's good to hear.
Yeah.
Well, l guess that's
all we have to know.
All you have to know for what?
We were going to fly
to lowa and surprise Buddy.
But then we thought
maybe he didn't want
to get back together.
So we thought
we'd better come up here
and check it out with you.
l don't think there's anything
in the world he'd want more
than to have you guys back.
[ Both ]
Well, all right!
Where does the show go next?
Hand me my book.
Let me check.
Let's see.
Clearlake tonight.
Tomorrow night,
it's M-M-Moorhead,
Minnesota, 8:00.
That's it.
We're going to be there
with bells on.
Can you imagine the look
on that hotshot's face
when he comes out on stage,
and we're standing there
cool and calm as could be?
- He's going to be thrilled!
- Thrilled? He'll shit!
And right now,
l'd like to introduce myself
to you.
l'm J.P. Richardson.
l'm a disc jockey
from Beaumont, Texas.
And l'd like to introduce you
to a fellow Texan,
a good friend of mine...
and a good friend of yours,
Mr. Buddy Holly!
