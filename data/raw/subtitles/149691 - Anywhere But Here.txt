 All too often  
  I set my life aside  
 All too often  
  My dreams went sailing by 
 A chance offreedom  
 A chance offaith  
 A chance I'll take  
  Knowing it all will disappear 
  It ain't anywhere but here  
 All too often  
 The dreams I dreamed have died  
[Chewing Loudly]
 All too often...  
Ann: My mother made
an amazing amount ofnoise
when she ate her food.
It was as ifshe was trying to
taste the entire world.
Sometimes I just couldn't stand her.
Sometimes I hated her.
Sometimes I thought
she was ruining my life.
What kept me going was knowing
that one day I would leave her.
  I'll find it anywhere but here  
  Come on, baby, surfin' safari  
 Yeah, I'm gonna take you
surfin' safari  
 Yeah, I'm gonna take you
surfin' safari  
 Yeah, I'm gonna take you
surfin' safari  
  Let's go surfin' now  
  Everybody's learnin' how  
  Come on a safari with me  
  Ba la la la la la la  
[Turns Off Radio]
I hate this song.
I love this song.
It's the Beach Boys.
I hate the Beach Boys.
Honey, how can you
hate the Beach Boys?
Nobody hates the Beach Boys.
They're too happy and sunny.
Well, you're gonna have to learn
to like happy and sunny,
because that's what
California's all about.
Oh, next stop, Salt Lake City. Yes!
Salt Lake City, Utah.
The capitol, right?
I don't care.
Oh, yes, you do care.
Come on, don't mumble.
You care.
You're very good at capitols.
Idaho.
Come on, pooh bear, Idaho.
Stop calling me pooh bear.
But you are my little pooh bear.
Come on.
Come on. Idaho.
Boise!
I don't want to play.
Ok, now you do one for me.
A really hard one.
I said I don't want to play.
[Whimpering]
Oregon.
Portland. Too easy.
Salem.
It's Salem?
I don't want to do this anymore.
I don't want to be in Utah.
2,000 miles between us and Bay City. Ok.
I want to be back in Bay City.
This is like being kidnapped.
You don't understand that, doyou?
I wish somebody had kidnapped me
when I was your age.
So do I.
Ann: Grandma always said
that my mom was a strange child.
Oh, this is absolutely moribund.
Gwen Purvis has cancer.
That's worse.
I didn't give it to her.
You didn't give it to her.
That's funny, Aunt Adele.
You're gonna die
one day, too, Mom,
just like the rest of us.
But not in this town.
Ann: My mother never
wanted to stay in Bay City.
I think she married my step father Ted
because he was so nice
and so clean.
Being an ice skating instructor
made him seem cleaner.
She missed my real father,
who was Egyptian,
dark, and romantic.
One Christmas Eve
I heard my parents arguing.
[Car Door Closes]
[Engine Starts]
I didn't know anything
until he was gone.
He drove away in our brown Valiant.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You're awfully quiet.
You said we'd see
an Indian reservation.
When we get to one,
we will see one.
Sweetie, don't mumble.
How are you gonna be an actress
if you can't speak clearly?
I don't want to be an actress.
I bet we won't even stop
in Las Vegas, will we?
Ah, now, that's what's bothering you.
You said you had a number on him.
I said we would look him up, ok?
When you were 4 years old,
your father left youjust
in the middle of the night.
So, what?
You left my stepfather
in the middle ofthe afternoon.
I miss Ted.
Nobody misses Ted.
He's boring.
Then why'd you marry him?
That's none of your business.
Besides, he was running
around with other women.
That's not true.
You made that up.
You wanted him to
soyou could catch him
and take him to court
and get all his money.
You little snoop.
And Ted is not a homosexual.
I never said that.
Yes, you did.
Oh, no, I did not.
Oh, yes, you did.
Maybe I inferred it,
but I never said it.
'' Light in the loafers''
is not exactly the same thing.
All right, Mother.
Ted said he loves you,
and that he was worried that
you were seeing other people,
which you probably were.
All right, that is it.
I have had it with you.
If you miss Ted so much,
you go find Ted.
Go on, get out ofthe car.
Out! O-u-t, out!
You said we'd see
buffalo in Nebraska.
There were no buffalo.
Tough shit!
Get out of the car!
Ted is going to be
an ice skating instructor
for the rest of his life.
Your cousin Benny is going
to be a garage mechanic.
Lolly is never
going to leave the bank.
Your cousin Hal's
already drinking liquor.
And Sylvia and the baby
can barely breathe.
They're gonna suffocate back there,
but I now have a job teaching
in the Los Angeles school system.
I have an M.A. in early education
which I have just thrown away
in that dink junior high school
back there,
soyou forget about the buffalo
and the goddamn Indians.
You are a beautiful girl
with great potential.
I'm not gonna see your future
as some nothing girl
in a nothing factory
in a nothing town.
You are 14 years old,
you've always had enough to eat,
you've always had
a roof over your head,
and if you stick with me,
you always will,
because I am your mother,
and I know what is best for you
because that is my job.
Plus you're gonna go
to school in Beverly Hills,
which is only
the best school district
in the United States.
And you'll be a child actor
while you're still a child.
You don't have ajob
in the Los Angeles school district.
I will have.
I have an interview
and a great outfit.
Are you hungry?
- [Mumbles]
- Excuse me.
I don't know.
Great. So am I.
So...
Will you look at that car?
Is that the most
beautiful automobile
you've ever seen?
No. I hate that car.
I miss the Plymouth.
Baby, nobody misses the Plymouth.
It's your color.
Yeah, it is, isn't it?
Oh, look at this.
It's so beautiful.
Man: How does it feel?
Sublime.
Mom, we can't afford this car.
We have some money in savings,
and I can dip into
the teachers' retirement fund.
This car does not belong in Bay City,
and neither do we.
[Laughs]
We're going to drive
to Beverly Hills
in this car.
Ann: Mom, this place
looks expensive.
Adele: I'll worry about that, ok?
Now that we're in Beverly Hills,
maybe you should change
your name to Heather.
Mmm, it smells so nice here.
How much is the room?
It's 1 ,200.
A night?
Yes.
I don't know
that it's large enough.
Do you have any villas?
There are no villas
available right now.
Mom, I'm tired.
Where are we gonna sleep tonight?
[Sirens Approaching]
Adele: Sweet pea,
you are just as pretty
as these girls on TV.
In fact, I think you're prettier.
[Knocking On Door]
Sweetie, are you all right?
'Cause you've been in there
for over an hour.
Ok, well...
I'm gonna go to sleep now.
And I think mayb eyou should soon,
because you need
your beauty rest, ok?
Ok. Good night.
Ann: I miss everyone
in Bay City so much.
I don't know how
I'm going to survive
without my cousin Benny.
And my best friend,
good little Mary.
Serious Mary, Benny, and I.
We were inseparable.
Adele: Benny!
I made this for you.
Say good-bye to your cousin!
It's tin and painted on one side
with gold dust.
Not real gold dust.
Ann!
We're ready to go!
Where do you want
the cookies and the sandwiches?
Oh, Mom, thanks.
I'll take them.
You didn't give her all the cookies,
did you, Lillian?
Don't forget to call us
from the road.
You're gonna come visit.
I'm gonna find an apartment
that's got 3 bedrooms.
She doesn't even have
a place to live.
Stop worrying about it, Mom.
If you knew for sure
there was a job out there...
She's got the school job.
Oh, she has no such thing.
She talked to somebody
on the telephone.
When areyou gonna start
having some faith in me?
When you begin
to see things as they are.
Don't take any wooden nickels, Adele.
Right,Jimmy.
Ok, thanks.
Sorry, Ted.
I'll write.
Ann, come on!
I'm gonna leave without you!
Benny!
Jimmy: Ben!
I hope you destroyed those pictures
you took of me in my underwear.
I did, Mary, I promise.
Ok.
Let's go.
We'll call from the road.
I'll miss you, too, Grandma.
Take care of yourself.
Ann, here.
Just in case you find
a skating rink out there.
Thanks, Ted.
I love you. You're the best stepdad
a girl could have.
 You'll always be with me  
 Always be with me  
  Part of my heart  
  Once I'm where I'm going  
  Look away 
  Even if it's just in my mind  
Oh, here's a good one.
'' Pool, walk-in closets, security,
vaulted ceilings.''
Vaulted. I love it.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhearing.
I thought I might help you.
I'm Gail Letterfine.
Westside Realty.
Oh.
So, what are you looking for?
Something in Beverly Hills.
I'm Adele August.
This is my daughter Ann.
Hi.
Hi.
She's not awake.
We just moved here from Wisconsin.
Wisconsin?
I don't know anyone
from Wisconsin.
I'm awake.
You live in Beverly Hills?
No. I live in Santa Monica.
Formerly from Bel Air.
Formerly Brentwood.
I've had a lot of formerlys
in my life.
I'm fine now.
I'm single, I'm free,
and I love it.
Most of the time. Yeah.
Excuse me.
She wants to be an actress.
Don't they all?
[Line Rings]
Operator.
Just tell her it's a collect call
from her granddaughter Ann.
Just one moment.
Tell her I'll pay her back.
Lookwhat we have
along Beverly Vista.
Beverly Hills adjacent.
That's not the posh part
of Beverly Hills,
but it is still within
the school district.
[Line Rings]
[Ring]
Sweet pea, what you doing?
Are you ok?
Mm-hmm.
Gail found something for us.
What a woman.
She is raising 3 teenagers by herself.
Husband ran off
with an accountant,
and she can't get
a dime out ofhim.
Come with me while I pee.
Come on. Also...
she didn't say so, but...
[Whispering]
I think she has a glass eye.
You know...
it makes somebody interesting.
You know what I mean?
Interesting in a mysterious way.
Interesting in a kind ofa...
Man: Hey, you want a ride?
Ann, there you are.
Your mom's looking for you.
I saw her.
You know, I think that
we might have found a place.
Honey, I know that it's hard
at first, making changes,
butyou have to get used to it.
Life is full of them.
Ann, where did you go?
I was in there talking
and talking to you.
I come out here and you're gone.
 Your love  
  Is better than ice cream  
  Better than anything else
that I've tried  
 Your love  
  Is better than ice cream  
  But everyone here knows how to cry 
  It's a long way down  
  It's a long way down  
  It's a long way down  
 To the place where we started from  
You didn't get the job.
It's in the bag, baby.
Come here, you.
Serious?
Yes!
I hate my hair.
It's one of your strongest assets.
I'm gonna cut it off.
Over my dead body.
Ok.
[Laughs]
Ok. Let's go.
Can you believe that?
They look like
they're going to the beach.
The intelligent girls are inside.
Bab--
I hate you.
We'll talk about that later, sweetie.
Good luck.
How about good luck for me?
How do I l-look?
[Kids Talking And Laughing]
[Rap Music Playing]
[Kids Yelling And Arguing]
Why don't you just back off?
Punk!
Come on, let's go!
Everybody,
this is our new speech pathologist,
Adele August.
Adele is from Bay City, Wisconsin.
America's dairyland.
Ah, Wisconsin.
Yes.
George Franklin, history.
George. History.
[Bell Rings]
Room 12 is to the right, right?
Let me show you.
Follow me.
Thank you so much.
[Kids Shouting]
Not exactly Bay City,
but you get used to it.
Mmm. Is that--
Did they throw out that furniture?
Is that garbage?
Mm-hmm.
Unbelievable.
Honey, don't scratch the car.
Ann: On our days off
we would drive to relax.
We drove just anywhere.
My motherwas in awe of the homes
and the palm trees
and real movie stars
on public sidewalks.
She was in love.
In love with Beverly Hills.
Oh, I like that one.
Over there, with the circular driveway.
I want the room in the corner.
I can climb out that window.
I'll take the one in the back,
overlooking the pool.
[Gasps]
[Laughing]
Mmm. That one's a beauty,
with the cute blue shutters.
Oh, look at this house.
This is the house I want.
That is beautiful. Come on.
Mom, it's by appointment only.
It's all right.
It says,
'' Do not disturb occupants.''
Just smile.
We'll be fine. It's ok.
Realtor: I appreciate it.
Please think about it.
You're the realtor.
Hi. How can I help you?
Look at this sweet--
Oh, he gave me a kiss.
This is Callie.
Hi, Callie.
And you must be the owner.
My baby. Yes, I am.
Well, I'm Adele August. Hello.
And this is my baby, Heather.
Hi.
Realtor: Excuse me.
Can I help you?
I know we should
have an appointment,
but my husband will be
practicing medicine at UCLA.
That's just a few minutes
from here.
Exactly, so we were driving by,
and we just had to stop.
I would be so grateful
if you would let us
see the house.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Please, come in.
Here's my card.
Here's a setup on the property.
Thank you.
The house was built originally
in the 1 920s,
so it maintains
all its original integrity.
You also have
a wood-burning fire place here.
There are 7 in the entire house.
There is so much light.
Look at this light.
Owner:
It's a very happy, happy house.
- So happy, isn't it, Heather?
- Happy.
And here we have
a beautiful bright bedroom.
And you can see the pool from here.
Oh, it's a lovely master suite,
isn't it?
No. This is my daughter's bedroom.
She's away at college now.
Oh. Where is she going?
Back East. Princeton, actually.
I want to go to college back East.
You must miss her terribly.
But we're so very proud.
Well, Daddy will
be here next week.
I really want him
to see this house.
Let me show you
the master bedroom right now.
It's got a great
his-and-herwalk-in closet.
It also has a fantastic
Jacuzzi tub.
Adele: I love a Jacuzzi.
[Line Rings]
[Ring]
Benny: Hello.
[Quietly]
What's up, pervert?
Who is this?
It's hot stuff.
Ann.
Hey, Benny.
Where are you?
Making a highly illegal phone call
in somebody's bedroom.
What are you doing right now?
Hauser's taking us to the park.
He got that new truck.
Why are you whispering?
Where are you?
How's Grandma?
Fine. What did you mean
you're in someone's bedroom?
I'll tell you
when I write you another letter.
You get my last one?
Yeah, yeah, I got 'em all.
I like the one
where she kicked you out of the car.
She really did that?
She's crazy.
She still is.
I think I might kill her
in her sleep.
Adele: Heather.
I have to go.
Heather Ann.
Oh, that was so much fun,
wasn't it?
Why'd you tell that lady
that we'd buy the house?
I said we might buy the house.
That my father's coming,
that he's a doctor.
Cardiologist.
I couldn't believe you.
What were you doing
up in the daughter's room
all that time?
Calling Benny.
What?
Ann!
I had to tell her that your father
the doctor was coming
because a woman like that
who gets all ofher money from
her husband, she's not gonna believe
a woman like me can afford
a house like that.
A woman like you
can't afford a house like that.
You can't even afford
the bathroom to that house.
  Be optimistic  
  Don't you be a grumpy 
 When the road gets bumpy 
 Just smile, smile, smile  
 And be happy 
Morning, Adele.
Morning, George.
Grand Coolie Dam.
Ever been there, Adele?
Nope.
Hoover Dam?
No.
I'm not really into dams.
Girl:
I am gonna get a lawyer
and sue her
for invasion of privacy,
so get your nose
out of my diary, Mother.
That's so cool.
I'd never think of that.
Did she say anything?
She played dumb,
but she never did it again.
I wish my parents
would just leave me alone.
I love being alone.
I can't wait for
the house to be empty.
Hi.
Hey, Peter.
You run good.
Got good form.
Yeah.
There's not a cloud
in the sky today, huh?
Hey, you ever read T.S. Eliot?
What?
4 Quartets,
It's really good.
Why do you run with a book?
I don't know.
Balance, I guess.
George: Here's the Kariba Dam.
It impounds the Zambezi River,
forms Kariba Lake.
- It's nice.
- Hmm.
I went there.
After college.
I painted a picture ofit.
You painted pictures ofdams?
Mm-hmm.
That was my dream--
To travel the world
and paint pictures.
Hmm. What happened?
Hmm. I don't know.
One damn thing
led to another damn thing.
Ha ha!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I became a history teacher.
But one of these days, I'll...
One of these days--
Oh, my God.
Get away from my car!
Oh, my God, look what he's doing!
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
No! Stop it!
Oh, my God.
Look how deep this scratch--
Look what he did to my car.
Mom, it's just a scratch.
Just a scratch?
Do you know how much
it's going to cost
to fix ''just a scratch''?
Oh, I can't work
at this school anymore.
I can't talk to you anymore, either!
No sympathy.
The tiles are all cracked...
and chipped.
I'm sinking here,
and I'm the one
that has to keep us afloat.
Every time I think
I'm trying so hard,
it's getting better,
and we're starting to get somewhere,
just, everything falls apart.
Aah!Jesus!
Nothing works in this apartment!
- Mom?
- Aah!
It's just a scratch on the car.
Maybe if you got yourself
a little after-school job,
you'd know what
I'm talking about.
People your age have no idea
how much things cost,
how to manage money.
What is that now?
You didn't pay the bill again,
did you?
I did pay the bill!
I did pay it!
Well, maybe I won't even
pay the bill again.
Maybe we'll just...
Ha!
We could live...
in the dark
like little...
bears in a cave,
huh, pooh bear?
Hmm?
Just...
Ok, let's go to Denny's.
Ann?
Ann, where are you?
I'm going to bed.
[Door Slams]
I really thought I paid that bill.
I really think I did pay it.
[Crying]
So, I loveyou and
say hi to Benny for me
and UncleJimmy
and Aunt Carol and...
Ok, I loveyou.
Lots ofkisses.
[Kisses]
Bye.
Hi, Mom.
How are y'all doing?
What isn't fair?
Well, I put her on
because what's fair
is for your grand daughter
to have a decent home
to live in,
and we can't do that
unless we have some cash
for a down payment.
What I need from you
is some help.
Well...
sell my land, that's how.
It's the land that Daddy--
She hung up.
Grandma hung up on you?
Yeah.
[Hangs Up]
Let's get dressed up
and go out to dinner.
What?
You love that
little French restaurant.
That's--
That'sjust what we need.
We need a bed for me.
We need a desk.
We need sheets.
We need towels.
We don't need to go out to eat
to a French restaurant.
Oh, honey.
My daddy always used to say,
''When life gets rough
and you only have a dime
in your pocket,
go get your shoes shined.''
Get dressed.
Hmm.
Seems they raised their prices.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't the two ofus--
Good afternoon.
Would you like to hear our specials?
I don't think so.
We know what we want.
I'd like to hear the specials.
Thank you.
Ok. We have the veal St.Jacques
and a lovely coq au vin--
I think we'll have
2 small garden salads
and share the veal St.Jacques.
Don't you think, honey?
You know what?
I don't really want to share.
I'm kind of hungry, so...
Why don't you have
the veal St.Jacques,
and I'll have
the duck l'orange, please.
And would you like an appetizer?
- I don't think so.
- Yes.
I'll have the shrimp
in the garlic sauce.
Waitress:
And anything to drink?
Just water.
Bottled. A big bottle,
please. Thanks.
Ok.
Thankyou.
You know what?
I'm really hungry,
and it's not like
we're at Denny's,
so if someone comes in
and sees me eating duck l'orange,
who knows what effect
it'll have on my life.
Sit up straight.
You're slouching.
Ann: I took out an ad
in the newspaper once--
'' 1 5-year-old seeks home--
Neat, pretty, good student.''
I got 79 replies.
I never opened them.
I was afraid the temptation
would be too great.
Passion.
Ann: It was our first Christmas
away from home.
Doyou customize scents?
No? Oh, that's a shame.
You should do that.
My mother paid enough of our bills
so that we could buy
presents for everyone.
Ann: That's pretty cute.
Lavender.
What do you think?
Uhh.
- Yeah?
- Mmm.
We didn't buy too much,
considering I love that store.
I don't know what to get Benny.
What did you get me?
Come on, you got me something.
I didn't get you anything.
Oh, yes, you did.
What'd you get me?
I got you lots.
I'm dying to show it to you.
No. Don't show me.
Ann, hi.
Isn't it obscene,
all this money being spent?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
Hi, I'm Janice Pearlman.
I'm in Ann's homeroom.
I'm Ann's mother.
She's my mother.
Hi.
You--You look alike, you two.
- No.
- Oh, thanks.
No, we don't.
I look like my dad.
Just his chin.
I like your chin.
I do.
Anyway, listen, I got to go,
because my mother's
waiting over there,
but Christmas Day,
we're having a party at the house
from 4:00 to 8:00.
Will you come, both of you?
It's our annual thing.
- I--
- Thanks. That's sweet.
Really?
Well, please.
I'll tell you more at school.
Everybody's going to come, though.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Hi.
Ann: Everybody likes her.
She's on student council,
and her brother's the editor
of the school newspaper.
What does her father do?
I think he's a doctor.
Huh. Well, it might be fun.
You want to go?
Do you want me to go?
I guess it'll
give us a chance
to kind of show ourselves off,
and the car is looking great again.
Great.
Her mom looked...
very elegant.
You're elegant, Mom.
We both are.
We've got taste, huh?
That's one thing--
People look at us, and they say,
'' Look at that great-looking
mother and daughter.''
[Sighs]
Where do they live?
Mom, why are you doing this?
Which one is it, honey?
Point it out.
That one.
Now let's go home.
Oh, my God.
It goes all the way
around the block.
[Music Playing]
Ann: Yeah.
We're going to a party tonight.
Yeah. Mom and I are both going.
Do you want to talk to her again?
Just say merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to everybody.
I love you.
Give a big hug to Benny for me.
Ok. Bye-bye.
Loveyou. Bye.
I'm going to go get dressed
and try on my new necklace.
[Blows]
Mom, it's 4:00.
Areyou going to get dressed?
It takes you an hour
to get ready. We're--
The party's going to be over by then.
I thought you said
you wanted to go.
Honey, what I want
is to get all of these pine needles
and vacuum those closets.
They're filled with dust.
And maybe wash the kitchen floor,
because I realized, sweetheart,
that the thing that's going
to make me most happy
is tojust look around this place
and see that it is spick-and-span.
But it's the one fun thing
we can do for Christmas.
Well, then, you should go.
You should definitely go.
I mean, all your friends are
going to be there, right?
And that boy Peter--
Is that his name?
He'll be there, right?
What are you going to do?
It's Christmas.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I've just got a million things
that I'm going to do.
I want our first Christmas
in Los Angeles to be perfect.
Aren't things--
Aren't things bad enough here?
I don't know
why you're doing this to me.
[Sighs]
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Want me to drive you there?
- Want me to drive you?
- No.
- No.
- Yeah.
No.
I can walk.
All right, well, then, go.
Go ahead.
Otherwise, we're just going
to hang around here all day
talking about our silly
little lives, huh?
Oh, gosh, I just had the...
strongest memory of my father.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to be late.
I'm sorry that you never
really got to know
your grandfather or
your father, for that matter,
and I know it means
something to you
to find your father,
sweetie.
I promise.
We will.
- I'm going.
- Ok.
I'm going.
And maybe we can, um...
We'll talk about your father
when you come back.
I'll be here.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll wait.
[Crying]
[Dog Barking In Distance]
  I wish for a place  
 Where the earth doesn't shake  
 And if the earth won't be still  
 Then you and I will  
[Footsteps]
  Mmm  
  Mmm  
I'm sorry.
I thought I could go, but...
I couldn't.
You know what we need?
Some sugar in our blood.
You want to get some ice cream?
I don't want ice cream.
Sure, you do.
Is that what I want, Mom?
It would cheer us up.
Ok, Mother,
let's get our sugar.
And they've got a new flavor.
Great.
Let's go.
I'll get your jacket.
[Sighs]
Just one little--
Man: No, no, no, no, no.
We close early today.
Nothing?
It's Christmas.
Ay.
Christmas.
Oh, my God.
Merry Christmas, Officer.
You're not working today, are you?
You see that red curb, ma'am?
See that '' No Stopping'' sign?
- Oh. Oh.
- Give me your driver's license, please.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
Did you see--
I was just here
to get her an ice cream.
- She needed an ice cream.
- Don't blame it on me.
I'm just explaining
to the officer, sweetheart.
- I hate it when you do this.
- What?
You always do this to me.
You always--
I was explaining to him
it's our Christmas tradition--
I didn't even want ice cream.
She wanted ice cream.
Ann, where are you going?
She'll be back.
Excuse me.
She won't be back.
Hey, hey, hey.
You stay by the car, ok?
Adele: Ann?
Lady, wait by the car!
All right.
Ann, come here.
Ann.
Wait.
It was her idea to park there.
I told her not to park there.
I didn't even want any ice cream.
Your mother's trying
to beat a ticket.
Give her one.
She already has a drawer full of them.
Now, now.
Don't talk to me
like a little girl.
I'm not a little girl.
You don't even understand.
I'm going to leave her
one of these days.
I'm sure you will,
but not today.
Why not today?
Well...
you should leave her
when you're calm...
when you're rational.
You leave her
when you're ready not to come back.
You understand?
You from Wisconsin?
How do you know?
Well, your plates.
- You living here now?
- Yes.
- Hey, Ann.
- Lady, I want you to register that car.
Yes, sir.
I want you to get
a California driver's license.
From now on,
start paying attention to the signs.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to be rolling by
in another 2 minutes.
I don't want to see
that vehicle out there.
Yes, sir.
Good.
Merry Christmas, Ann.
Let's move up here.
Did he just wink at you?
That's an unusual
law enforcement officer.
What did he say to you?
He said not to ever
do that to me again.
He said that if you do,
he'll have you taken off to prison
and locked up,
and you'll never, ever see me again,
and you'll have to eat
ice cream on your own.
You went too far
with the ice cream business.
He did not say that.
- Yes, he did.
- No, he did not.
And he wants to adopt me.
He finds me very attractive.
That is not funny.
You do not do this again.
Don't you do this again.
No, don't you do this again.
No, it's you.
Look...
I was just trying to get out
ofa parking ticket.
Well, you didn't get one, did you?
Thank you, Ann.
Thank you, Ann,
and your fiancé will be
back here in 2 minutes
to see if we've moved the car.
Ann: I will always love that policeman.
That was all me.
He told me what I needed to know.
I will always carry a soft spot
for the Los Angeles Police Department.
[Music Playing]
Ann: I wish he had adopted me.
Grandma told me in a letter
that my father got remarried
and was living in Reno.
How many Hisham Badirs
could there be in Reno?
Hi. Do you have a number for...
for a Mr. Hisham Badir, please?
B-a-d-i-r.
Residence.
H-i-s-h-a-m.
Thank you.
Ok. Thank you.
Bye.
Ann: When I was younger,
my mother always hummed
one of my father's tunes
before we went to sleep.
He wrote my mother love songs.
Sometimes, I would imagine my father
showing up to rescue me.
Hi, Ann.
Hello, Peter.
You got that
isosceles triangle thing straight?
Mm-hmm.
That baffles me.
Hey, I got a new trumpet.
You want to see it?
I'm working, Peter.
Right.
Sorry.
Your mom's really pretty.
I'll tell her.
What's your dad do?
He's a songwriter.
Really?
I write some songs.
Yeah. You want to hear one?
Not now, Peter.
You want to feel my pulse?
It's beating really fast.
Ba-bum,
ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum,
ba-bum, ba-bum.
Really fast.
Adele:
I don't understand.
I have been telling you for weeks
that the tiles are chipped.
There's no water pressure.
The handles are coming off
of the cabinets.
Now, you don't have a life.
What's the problem?
Can't you--Hey!
I am talking to you.
Hey! Hey!
Mom, your pants.
I can't talk toyou
like this, Mrs. August!
Listen, I'm telling you that--
It's not just that
the tile is chipped.
The carpets are filthy.
They're filthy.
I've got a fungus on my foot
from those carpets.
Who was living here before,
a hockey team?
I cannot live like this!
You can't live like this,
butyou can live in
an apartment for 6 months
with just a mattress on the floor?
Ohh!
Damn it!
[Music Playing]
Ohh!
Turn it down!
God, I hate this place!
I hate my job!
I hate my foot!
Uhh!
You're not having sex
with anybody, are you?
What?
You know.
No, I don't know.
We have to get out ofhere.
We can't.
We have a lease.
What do you mean,
am I having sex with anyone?
Ann: We moved anyway.
Shh, shh, shh.
Over the next year,
we moved a lot.
We got used to it.
Oh, honey, let me help you.
Here.
That's a girl. Ok.
It's apartment number 8?
Yeah, number 8. Ohh.
Ann: At least this one had furniture,
thanks to Miss Letterfine.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Ann: Gail and Mom
have become good friends.
[Hums]
Cheers.
It's so colorful. Look.
Ann: My mom dragged me
to an audition.
- Hello.
- Woman: Hi.
She would not give up on her fantasy
of me becoming an actress.
What's your social security number,
sweetheart?
Uh...
Ann?
We did our work
and kept healthy.
Woman On TV: And exhale.
Draw your navel
to your backbone.
And when summer came,
we went to the beach
and felt sorry
for everyone back home.
Where are you going?
I think right over there.
There's no people over there.
I know.
I need some peace and quiet today.
Ann: You just want to be
near that beach club.
Yes, please.
Man: I'm open.
I'm open.
Woman: He's over there.
Man: Yo, Nick.
Here's a good spot.
Man: There you go.
You guys feel like playing
some middleman?
Sweetie, you have
a cute little body.
You should show it off more.
You should show off your body.
I plan to, but--
Where are you going?
Japan.
- Man: Heads up.
- Aah!
Sorry about that.
That's ok.
Ooh!
You're strong.
[Laughs]
Wild thing.
Man: Hey, Josh, I'm open.
Aw!
[Inaudible]
Adele:
Oh, shame on you.
[Laughs]
Oh, Ann.
Ann, come here, sweetie.
This is Dr. Spritzer.
This is my daughter Ann.
Ah, a big girl.
Oh, yes.
We're more like sisters.
So, you're the actress, I hear.
Oh, no, not me. Her.
My mom's the actress.
Oh, silly girl.
Don't be shy.
Dr. Spritzer's an orthodontist,
and he works with the actresses.
He did Heather Locklear.
Her teeth.
I was telling the doctor
that just this morning,
we were discussing your overbite.
See what a great smile she has?
The bottom is just
a little strange.
They don't look
so strange to me.
Woman:Josh!
Come on!
Ahem.
Be right there.
Adele.
Yes,Josh.
You play good ball.
You, too.
Take care of those two-fers, now.
An actress has to keep smiling.
See you.
See you.
That's probably his wife.
Why'd you have to talk
about my teeth?
It won't last long.
Mom?
- Mom? Mom?
- Ann?
- Mom, guess what.
- What?
Benny's coming.
Yes!
Ohh!
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Come on, come on,
come on, my turn.
Oh, how are you doing?
  I was just out of high school  
So what doyou think so far, Benny?
You've got more Mercedes cars
on one street
than we've got in all of Wisconsin.
Benny wants to see a movie star.
Really?
Who do you want to see?
I don't care.
I just want to see one.
How about the babes in Baywatch ?
Yeah.
  Chotee  
  Soyoung, so confused  
 What was I to do?  
  I'm so sorry, Chotee  
Look it's a perfect fit.
Yeah, me, too, with Donald.
[Imitating Donald Duck]
Look, guys.
Smile.
Let me take it.
Let me take it.
Maybe you can come back
for a visit?
I'll teach you
how to drive the truck.
I'd like that.
You know what?
What?
Your boobs are getting big.
Shut up.
[Laughs]
Mary Girling and Julie Eastman--
Gettin' really big ones.
Don't be gross.
Oh, boobs aren't gross.
Boobs are beautiful.
- [Rustling]
- Shh.
[Ann Laughing]
[Benny Belches]
[Laughing]
Ew!
You are so gross.
You are so gross.
You got a boyfriend?
Maybe.
Who?
Do you go to bed with him?
Mm-hmm.
3, maybe 4 times a day.
What about you?
You gettin' laid, Benny?
Susie?
[Laughing]
Shh.
Ew.
You put the wood
to Susie Goodman?
Uh-huh.
3, sometimes 4 times a day.
Shut up.
[Laughter]
And tell your mother that next summer,
everybody comes out.
We've got our eye on this cute
little house not far from the water.
Ok.
And tell her how brown
Ann and I are.
We don't look bad, do we?
No. You look real brown.
And you tell her, well,
how healthywe are.
Well, you've always
looked healthy, Aunt Adele.
Yeah, but not this healthy, right? Huh?
Here, this is for you.
And have a great flight, sweetie.
[Chuckles]
Bye.
Ok. Bye.
Bye.
Thanks.
Say hello to Ted for me.
Thank you.
Is he seeing anybody?
P.A.: Maywe have
your attention, please?
Thank you.
This is a security announcement.
All persons are reminded
not to leave their baggage
unattended at any time.
[Kisses]
Adele: Ann?
Ann?
Ann?
Ann?
I can't find my daughter.
She was right here,
now I can't find her.
- Mom?
- Where did you go?
I was right here.
I was looking
all over for you.
I couldn't find you anywhere.
It's ok.
I was gone for 5 seconds.
Don'tyou ever
do that again.
I couldn't find you.
Shh, shh.
I didn't know where you were.
It's ok, Mom.
I'm here.
I'm right here.
I'm right here.
It's all right.
[Telephone Rings]
Both: You get it.
[Ring]
You get it.
[Ring]
Both: You get it.
Tch.
[Ring]
Hello?
Just a minute.
- Foryou.
- Who is it?
Who's speaking?
Josh Spritzer.
Josh Spritzer.
Oh, God.
The guy from the beach,
the orthodontist.
Hi.
Yeah, of course I remember.
At the beach.
Uh-huh.
I've thought of you, too.
I'm surprised that you
tracked down my number.
Oh, I wrote it
on the football.
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh, that's so naughty of me.
[Laughing]
Oh.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Separations can be so painful.
Oh, yeah.
When I broke up with my ex,
I mean,
I could barely breathe.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Well, tonight?
No, tonight's not good.
How about, um...tomorrow?
Uh-huh.
I love the place.
7:00.
Great.
I'll see you then.
Ok.
Me, too.
I've been feeling it all day.
It has been in the air all week.
Oh, my God.
What to wear,
what to wear,
what to wear.
Focus. Shoes.
It would be tragic
to be wearing the wrong shoes
when you meet the right guy.
I'm gonna go shopping.
[Piano Music Playing]
Waiter: Rob Roy.
Adele: Thank you.
Martini straight.
Josh: Thanks, man.
Olive?
I love olives.
Cherry?
Yeah.
Pooh bear?
Sweetie?
Sweet pea?
[Kisses]
Hi.
Hi.
You ok?
Where were you?
[Chuckles]
Finding out
I didn't die in Bay City.
Oh.
''Oh'' what?
I don't know.
What time is it?
5:00.
[Moans]
Mmm, we just clicked.
Wejust clicked, sweetie.
Let's go watch the sunrise.
I need to sleep.
I'm starving.
I have to go to school, Mom.
Come on, I'll tell you all about him.
It's the middle ofthe night.
He's more than just a dentist.
He's writing a screenplay.
Come on. Hmm?
Come on, sweetie.
Just this once. Come on.
[Groaning]
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
That's a girl.
Did he say he loved you?
Well, grownups
don't really say things
like that right away,
especially if they've
been married before.
You know, it takes a little time.
But...he did do something that...
grownups do sometimes that shows...
that they really care about you.
What did he do?
Well, honey,
it's something that...
It's something that...
adults do in bed.
Sometimes.
I mean, not everybody.
I...especially
in Bay City, but...
Ted never did it?
Oh, please.
I was lucky if I could get Ted
to take off his ice skates.
Did my father do it?
Let's not talk about this now,
sweetie, ok?
It's just something that...
just shows that
you're really serious.
You just don't...
You don't do it with every woman.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, it's difficult for you
when I feel something,
isn't it?
You know, I had that dream again.
You cut off your feet,
and you couldn't move,
and I couldn't get you
to leave the room.
Oh, sweetie,
I'm never gonna leave you.
Don't worry.
You don't have to
cut off my feet.
I understand.
I'm not a doctor of psychology
for nothing.
You're not a doctor
of psychology, Mom.
I wonder what time it is.
I really want to hear
his voice again.
Oh, sweetie, we made
the right choice, didn't we,
by coming here.
I know that it was hard
in the beginning,
but look at us.
Look at us now, huh?
And look at this day,
look at this place,
and look at you, and...
You're gonna be
getting braces soon, and...
when your teeth are straight,
your face is gonna be just perfect.
Hmm?
[Sighs]
[Clears Throat]
Good morning.
It's me.
Adele.
I didn't wake you, did I?
I just wanted you to know
that I'm still...
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
You are sleeping.
Go back to bed, yeah.
I'll--Call me later?
Ok.
Oh, and,Josh,
I'm really looking
forward to Sunday.
The opera?
Oh, I--I must have misunderstood.
I thought you said
you had tickets.
Uh-huh.
Oh. No, you don't
have to apologize.
I--I totally understand.
Yeah. Ok.
Go back to bed.
Call me later.
Oh, and you know what?
This has been super special
for me,Josh.
Yeah.
All right.
Go back to bed.
Talk toyou later.
Sweet dreams.
I love you.
Hello?
Hello?
[Opera Music Playing]
Mom? Mom!
What do you think, darling?
Is it too much for the opera?
You're going to the opera?
- Ha! Yeah!
- Great!
[Laughing, Sighs]
So, when are you going?
Well,Josh said
that they're playing
a couple of times next week.
He hasn't told me
what specific date.
Which do you think?
The red scarfor the white scarf?
I don't know.
You have talked to him?
He did call, didn't he?
Pumpkin, he's going to call.
He said he would.
He'll call.
He's a Beverly Hills dentist.
They're busy.
What do you think?
Low-heel? High-heel?
Hmm?
[Telephone Rings]
Ooh.
[Music Stops]
Hello?
Is it him?
Oh,Jesus.
What is it?
Where's Mama?
Is she in the hospital?
Is Carol with her?
Well--Well, we will.
Of course we will.
Who was that?
It was Uncle Jimmy.
Grandma's had a stroke.
Oh, no.
Is she gonna be all right?
I don't know. Maybe.
Oh, honey.
There was an accident.
Bennywas killed riding home
in Jay Brosek's truck.
I'm sorry.
  I will remember you  
 Will you remember me?  
  Don't letyour life  
  Pass you by 
 Weep not for 
 The memories  
  I will remember you  
 Will you remember me?  
  Don't letyour life  
  Pass you by 
 Weep not for 
Ann: I felt so sad.
I had lost Benny.
But I was also losing something
that was once the only place
in the world for me.
 The memories  
Now the streets weren't as wide.
The trees seem lower...
and the house is smaller.
You look real good.
But you're different.
How?
[Chuckles]
I don't know.
Just...
You seem different, too, somehow.
I'm bigger.
I can speak some German.
[Speaking German]
That's '' How's the weather today?''
I like that.
So...
Do you think
you'll come back?
I don't know.
Now that I'm here...
I don't know.
You know what I think?
I think if you were to stay,
sooner or later,
you'd be just like your mom--
always wanting to go away.
Adele: I'm calling long distance.
Would you tell him
that I called again?
Well, has he gotten my messages?
Mm-hmm.
Ok. Well, tell him
that I'm out of state.
Tell him again.
And that, um...
I'll be home on Sunday.
Thank you.
Ann: Mary Girling was right.
We were different.
But some things
always stayed the same.
Got a light?
Yeah.
There was anger
that had been around
as far back as I can remember.
It was God's way.
Shut up about God's way.
Jimmy, don't.
I'm sorry, Reverend.
Maybe we should, um, start dinner.
Sit down, Sylvia.
I'm gonna barbecue.
Then why don't you start it, honey?
Ann: My uncle Jimmy
was ready to explode.
[Baby Crying]
I could feel it coming.
So, Adele...
do you like California?
Oh, yeah. Very much.
What's your day like,
Adele, back there?
Carol: Hal.
Well, I, uh...
work a full day at school
with my students.
And, uh, we live in Beverly Hills,
so it's quite a commute.
I have to be in the car
for at least 2 hours.
Let me tell you something,
Adele, we all work.
That wasn't necessary.
Anyone want another drink?
Carol:Jim.
Of course you work,Jimmy,
but you've also got
Mom's house now and the RV.
Could we not have
any fighting today?
Your life is not
that difficult, is it?
Well, maybe if I had
had half the help from the family
that you were lucky enough
to come into,Jimmy.
You come here a second with me.
I wanna show you something, Adele.
You don't have to
talk to her like that.
I want to show you the deed
and the mortgage to the house
that I've been paying on,
that I'm still paying on!
Carol: Damn it,
get out of the house.
You know who helped me
when I was by myself with a child,
all by myself?
Nobody.
Nobody helped me,Jimmy.
I'm gonna show you the deed.
You take a look at it.
Either you look at it
oryou shut your damn mouth
from now on.
Nobody talks to me like that,
Jimmy, not even you.
Come on, Ted,
take me to the Holiday Inn.
Make your phone calls there,
too, not here.
I knowyou need to get laid
back in Beverly Hills,
but can't you hold off
a little bit--
Adele. Adele!
Your sister's boy is dead.
Please, everyone just stop this.
God damn it.
Back off.
Come on.
We're going.
Ann.
We're going!
You can stay here
if you want, honey.
I'll make up Benny's bed for you.
Benny would love that.
Ann.
[Door Closes]
Not again, mother.
Get me the telephone.
Get it yourself,
if you even paid the bill.
Please hand me the phone.
He doesn't want to talk
to you anymore.
Don't you get it, mother?
Aw.
Jesus Christ.
Ready?
 You gotta scrape me from the floor 
  Everything around me is changing  
Mom? Rise and shine.
It's time to get up.
It's 7...7:40, Mom.
I have to get to school.
You have to get to work.
Come on.
You have to get out of bed, Mom.
You've been in bed all weekend.
You can't do this.
Ok. I'll drive.
I can drive.
Getyour big ass out of bed!
  But isn't this always what I wanted?  
  Isn't it just what I always wanted?  
Go away.
[Tires Screech]
[Horn Honks]
[People Shouting]
Hey, Adele.
George, this is your chance!
Put down the sign and go. Go.
Go paint a dam somewhere!
No money, no work!
No money, no work!
No money, no work!
No money, no work!
No money, no work!
No money, no work!
[Rock Music Playing]
[Music Stops Playing]
Ah, girls.
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss August.
Hi.
You went shopping?
I thought you had to
picket or something.
I can't work at that school.
I resigned.
I'm a woman of leisure now.
Let's celebrate.
You can't quit.
We won't have any money.
Honey, they did not pay me
enough to carry a sign.
That's why you carry
the sign, isn't it?
You get more money
if you carry the sign.
No.
They carry the sign because...
they like to struggle.
Some people need to struggle.
Struggle, struggle, struggle--
That's what someone taught them.
Get out there and struggle--
That's what somebody said to them.
But we...did not come
to Beverly Hills to struggle.
We need to pay the rent.
Yup, that's true.
So maybe you're just gonna have
to get a little after-school job
instead of bringing the gals home
to do their nails all afternoon.
We're studying for a French test.
Oh.
And you shouldn't have quit your job.
[Speaking French]
- I am your mother, am I not?
- I guess so.
Well... ta mère has something
she would like to say to you en anglais,
''Auditions.
Caucasian, female. 1 2-1 6.
Hostile, withdrawn loner.''
You can handle that,
can't you, baby?
Why are you doing this?
You could do a little scene from
Terms of Endearment
or Clueless!
Yeah.
I bet you all could
do a scene from Clueless,
like totally!
That would be cool.
[Laughter]
I don't know those scenes.
I don't want to be an actress.
I don't know how to act.
I don't know anything.
I don't know why I'm here
and neither do you.
And what would you
have rather done,
stayed back home
and been one of those little girls
who sits longer
than the others on the porch
straining to hear the sounds
of the trucks on the highway?
You're acting crazy again.
One of those little girls
who has the names
of cities in her head
but has never been to one?
Who dreams of hotels
and has never sat in a lobby?
Is that what you want?
Ann, we're gonna go.
Where are you going?
I'll see you later, ok?
I'll call you, Ann.
Bye, Miss August.
Call me.
Adele: Ciao.
[Door Closes]
All right.
Where, where is it?
Where do you want me to go?
All right.
Circled it for you,
and I can call them for you.
I'll do it myself.
They're gonna want you
to do some improv,
but it should be related
to the material, ok?
Ok.
Yes?
- Hello.
- Hi.
I'm Heather Ann August's mother.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So, um, has she finished her audition?
Oh, she's in there now.
- She is?
- Yeah.
Can I see?
Can I watch her?
No. We can't interrupt.
Just a little, tiny bit.
Uh, excuse me?
She'd really like
for me to watch.
I'd rather you didn't.
- Ok.
- Ok.
Thanks.
I need Karen.
Karen?
Karen?
Karen Scarborough?
Ann: Mmm.
Mmm.
What a man.
What a meal he made ofme
during that thing
that adults do in bed.
Not many men know
how to do it, but...
when they do it...
it means they...
really love you.
They wouldn'tjust
do it to any woman.
It means they'll buy you a big house
with blue shutters and...
make life easy for you.
He's going to take us
to the Music Center.
The opera.
I love the opera.
[Wheezing Laugh]
He never returned my call.
[Sighs]
I didn't understand.
Oh, God, life is so shitty.
The whole world is so shitty.
Beverly Hills, what a bummer.
[Taps Pen Twice]
But...
so what?
Like my daddy always used to say...
  Be optimistic  
  Don't you be a grumpy 
 When the road gets bumpy 
 Just smile, smile, smile
and be happy 
  Don't wear a long face  
  It's never in style  
  Be optimistic and smile  
[Door Slams]
Mom?
Mom?
I'm sorry,
but you have to understand
I was just doing an audition.
It just came out.
I didn't plan it.
I didn't do it to hurt
your feelings.
You weren't supposed to be there.
I told you not to come.
I didn't even want
to go to the audition.
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.
I don't know what to say.
It just--It just happened.
They wanted me to--
Nobody would even know it was you.
I wake up and I don't
even want to be here.
Who would want to be with you?
You'rejust a crazy, middle-aged,
unemployed school teacher
with--with a child to support.
Why can't our lives just be normal?
You know, I get so scared sometimes
I want to go find my father.
You should find your father.
Maybe he can give you a normal life.
Hi, Miss Letterfine?
It's Ann August.
I'm all right.
Um...
I'm sorry to disturb you so late,
but is my mom there?
Oh.
No. I...
Well, she left a little while ago
and I was just wondering.
Never mind.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
All right.
Bye.
[Door Opens]
[Door Closes]
Ann: We didn't speak.
[Door Closes]
Ann: We've never
spoken about that day.
Now my motherwas trying
to cover up her feelings
with orange paint.
I felt so alone.
I miss Grandma.
I miss Benny.
I never stop missing Benny.
Go on. Just call.
You know you want to.
You've had his number forever.
You have a perfect right
to call your own dad.
I bet he's a really nice person
and just feels guilty
and hasn't had the nerve
to contact you.
Do something.
After all,
he did give you that rabbit's foot
to remember him by.
I'll do it.
No.
It's ok.
I'll dial and you talk, ok?
Ann,just get it over with.
Don't worry.
It's gonna be ok.
[Dialing]
I'm sorry.
It's ringing.
Don't hang up.
Don't hang up!
Ann!
Don't hang up.
Man: Hello?
Hello?
Mr. Badir?
Yes?
Is this--Is this Hisham Badir?
Yes. Who is this?
This is Ann.
I'm sorry?
Your daughter Ann.
Hello?
Wow. Ann.
How are you?
I'm ok.
A little taken by surprise.
I'd really like to see you.
Ohh...
Dad?
I wasn't exactly ready for this.
Do you think I could see you?
I heard you were married again.
Where did you hear that?
Someone in Bay City
told Uncle Jimmy.
Do you have any children?
Yes. A daughter.
I have a sister?
What's her name?
Tamara.
She's--She's 9.
So, uh...
Does Tamara know about me?
Do you ever think about me?
Ann...
do you need me to
help out in some way?
What?
Do you need some money?
That's--That's a terrible thing to say.
I--I just wanted to talk to you.
You're my father, and...
I thought maybe I could see you.
I thought perhaps
your mother asked you to.
My mother didn't ask me
to do anything.
Why would you say that?
You know your mother.
Yes, I do know my mother,
and this isn't about your money.
She has nothing to do with this.
Ann...
I don't know what to say.
Look, I'm in the middle of something.
- Can I--
- You don't--
You're not even glad
that I called, are you?
You don't care if
you ever see me again.
You don't give a damn
about me, do you?
Why don't you give me your number?
I'm sorry I called you.
Listen, Ann--
[Telephone Bangs]
You're better off without him.
Write him off.
Who needs him?
Sue the bastard for
child support or something.
[Crying]
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello?
Hello?
Ann?
Yeah, Peter?
I want to kiss your lips.
What for?
I don't know.
Well, if you can't think of
a better reason than that...
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
What?
I thought of another reason.
[Sighs]
I'm wild about your warm lips
and I want to squeeze--
I want to squeeze you tight.
I want to be one with you.
Yeah.
I want to part your lips
with my tongue.
Yeah, and then what?
Tell me. Then what?
I don't know.
Well, come on over.
[Unlocks Door]
Is your mom home?
No.
So...
Maybe we should go out some night.
No.
Come in.
So, what about that stuff
you were saying on the phone?
Where'd you learn that?
It's just in a book.
Why don't you take off
your clothes?
All right. Um...
Don't you want to talk first?
It's not even dark outside.
So?
Music? Do you want
to put on some music?
All right.
[Techno Music Plays]
Are those initials
on your underwear?
Yeah. My mom has that done.
Initial freak.
Take them off
and bring them to me.
I want to kiss you.
Ok.
Ok.
Wow.
Ann: That summer I turned 17...
and I started planning my escape.
[Blue Danube Waltz Playing]
My mother finally found
a job she liked
at a convalescent home.
She was good at what she did.
Here, look at yourself.
At last she had
a captive audience.
That was a good one.
Good. Good.
[Slowly] Waltz.
And where's that tongue
going on the ''l''?
Waltz.
It would help ifwe had
a little bit snazzier
lipstick here,Jack.
Ha ha ha!
Ok,Jack? We gotta get her
some perky lipstick.
Make that pucker.
Let's try it again.
''Wuh.''
Waltz.
I appreciate
how you are with my mother.
How you are with everybody.
She's coming along all right.
I'd like to talk more about this.
Afterwork?
I could take you out to
lunch or dinner some time?
Uh, thanks.
Tell you all about
the carpet business.
Yeah, sometime.
Bye, guys.
Bye, Ann.
Must have bagged
a zillion groceries today.
You must be so tired.
I really appreciate
you going with me.
I just couldn't deal
with it by myself.
Every time this guy looks
at me and asks me out,
it's just so sad.
He's so...nice.
When my wife died,
I started eating out all the time.
How was the pot roast?
Nice. It was nice.
Think you'll ever
go back to Wisconsin?
- Not for anything in the world.
- Yeah.
Well, is it that bad?
It was a dead end.
That's whywe left.
I sometimes think about
just picking up and leaving, too.
Whenever a new shipment
of carpets comes into my store,
I believe that
somewhere in the pile
there's one that flies.
It's been put there for me.
Some beautifully handwoven
16th century Persian rug
from A ThousandandOne Nights,
and I sit myself down on it
and I wave good-bye
to everybody in the store
and fly right out of the front door.
When I graduate this year,
my carpet's gonna fly me
back East to college.
You better tell your carpet
to dropyou at UCLA.
I'd like to go back East.
Since when?
I've been thinking about it.
Well, independence.
Sounds like her mother.
She's not going back East.
She's going to UCLA.
No, I'm not.
Honey, the hourly wage
bagging groceries at the supermarket
is never going to pay
for an eastern college.
But I'm saving
and I can apply for financial aid
and Grandma said she'd try to help.
Your Grandma knows about this?
She said when the time comes
maybe she'll be able
to help out a little.
I'd like to go away to college.
Why?
Because I want to get away.
You wanted to get out
of Bay City, didn't you?
I want to get out
of Beverly Hills.
I'm sorry I brought this up.
You're gonna end up back in Bay City?
I didn't say that.
After all this time?
After all that I've sacrificed?
Jack: Um...
have you two ever been
down to the grunion run?
No,Jack.
I have to say we have not been
to the grunion run.
What is a grunion?
It's a little coastal fish.
It comes up on shore
every once in a while
during high tide
and lays its eggs in the moonlight.
And then it dies.
It's yet another example of a mother
giving her life for her child.
Well, some of them die.
Not all of them.
Sounds really interesting.
I'd love to see that.
Well, I'd like to take you.
Great.
I like him.
He gets on my nerves.
He likes you,
and if he asks you out again,
I hope you'll go.
He asked me to go to Las Vegas
for the weekend.
Good. You should go.
You might have fun.
He is not my type.
He's not my idea of fun.
Go to Vegas, Mom.
Take a chance.
You don't have to fall
in love with him.
I'm not asking you
to even sleep with him.
Oh, thank you.
You could win the jackpot even.
All right, I will go to Vegas.
Fine. Just stop it.
But you are going to UCLA.
It's a state school,
it's all that we can afford,
and I do not want to hear
another word about it.
[Exhales]
''Jackpot.''
Ann: My mother didn't know it,
but I'd already applied to
Brown University in Rhode Island.
Peter tried to talk me
into going to Berkeley,
but my heart was set
on the East Coast.
My grades were really good,
and I thought I could get
a full scholarship.
I like the part
about the noble soul,
but do you really read Nietzsche?
I mean, I read Nietzsche.
I don't really read Nietzsche.
[Laughs]
He'd be a crazy friend to have,
don't you think?
Mm-hmm.
Besides, I think people
who read Nietzsche,
like really read Nietzsche,
are kinda...
I don't know.
Kierkegaard, though, he said that--
Ann: Where's the mail?
Where's the mail?
Right there.
You opened it.
Well, how else am I going to know
how you're planning your life?
After all, I'm only your mother.
Wh ywould you confide in me,
thank you very much.
Go ahead. Open it.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
Providence, Rhode Island?
Could you have gotten
any farther away from me?
Look, I just don't understand.
After all these years,
after all our hard work,
would it have killed you
to just stick around a bit
and show some respect
and appreciation
to the people that have
worried about you
and loved you
and have sacrificed
everything for you?
I'm not going anywhere!
If you're going to read my mail,
read it carefully.
They're giving me some money
for tuition and fees,
but not all ofit,
and we have to pay part ofit.
And we don't have that.
Read it.
'' Parents' contributions.''
God, I wanted it so bad.
Oh, pooh bear,
it's not the end of the world.
It is the end of the world!
Maybe not for you,
but it is for me.
We could get an ice cream.
No!
Can'tyou understand?
I want to go away to college.
I want to be on my own
and you on your own.
And I know you're scared
to be without me,
but I can't help that.
And I feel bad about that,
but I don't want
that job anymore.
Let me live my own life.
Let me go.
[Door Slams]
[Siren Whoops]
Ohh.
Good afternoon.
You went through that
stop sign back there.
I need your driver's license
and registration, please.
You want to take
the driver's license
out of this, please?
Oh, my God.
What?
You're the one who ran after
my daughter Ann on Christmas.
You winked at her?
Do you remember?
Oh, yeah.
I remember you two.
I know what you told her,
and she hasn't been the same since.
I'm sorry.
Can I have the driver's license?
You might have been right.
It hasn't been perfect, ok?
Hey, nobody's perfect.
Exactly. I make mistakes.
That's what I was saying.
Sometimes maybe
I'm a little bit selfish.
Maybe sometimes
I'm a little bit irresponsible,
and the lights go out sometimes.
But I'm trying.
That's the point, right?
I am trying. It's not easy.
I'm sure it's not easy for her, either.
If I could get
the driver's license from you?
I know I should have
helped her find her father,
but I knew that
he would disappoint her,
and she's better than that.
So I tried to find her
another father.
That's completely impossible.
I'm sure it's very difficult for you.
Did she tell you any of
the good things that I did?
'Cause I did a lot of good things.
I just need the license--
She's always had
a warm home, food--
- Lady--
- clothing--
Lady--
The best school system.
Did she tell you that?!
No, ma'am.
Gimme that license, please.
All right!
Thank you.
[Sighs]
You know,
she could have been an actress,
instead she wants
to go away to college.
She's telling me that
I have to let her go.
Well, it's always been
just the two of us,
and that is very hard.
I don't get it.
Doesn't she know
I--I would do anything for her?
I mean, I love her.
She is the reason I was born.
Doesn't she understand
that I would do anything for her?
Then you know what to do.
Yeah.
[Honk]
[Sobs]
I'll tell you what.
This is what I'm going to do for you.
I'm gonna let you go.
Ok.
Ok? Here's your driver's license.
Thanks.
Watch the signs, please.
Ok?
And have a nice day.
You, too.
[Sniffling]
[Sighs]
Mmm, it's beautiful.
It's your color.
It is, isn't it?
It makes you look so thin.
Oh, God, well, that's good.
Call me.
Oh, honey.
What are you doing?
You're home early.
I wanted to surprise you.
God, this is
a beautiful automobile.
Janet just bought our car.
You're selling the car?
Sold. Ha ha!
This is my daughter Ann,
you know, going to Brown.
I was telling her
all about you, sweetie.
Yeah. I love this car.
I was out with
a girlfriend in her car,
and I see your mom driving past.
When I saw that ''for sale'' sign
in the window,
I am telling you,
I heard a voice in my head saying,
''You have to have that car.''
I mean, I can't even
really afford it,
but it's, like,
the car that I see in my dreams.
Mom, why are you doing this?
What do you mean
I'm going to Brown?
Sweetie, we can afford it.
I worked it out.
I saved a little money in the bank,
and now with the money from the car--
I'm applying to UCLA.
Sweetheart, UCLA is for
surfers and wanna-be starlets.
She's a serious student.
Go to Brown.
You can't sell the car.
[Exhales]
Honey, we're gonna make it work.
At least for this year.
We'll worry about next year
next year, right?
I mean, we're good at that, aren't we?
Ok. Gonna drive it
away now, girls.
You can't drive it away.
That's our car.
That's our Mercedes.
It changed our lives.
Good luck, Janet!
Good luck to you, Adele!
Thank you again!
[Honk Honk]
[Trumpet Playing]
[Sighs]
So I'll come see you at Christmas.
And in the spring when you come,
I'll make sure I have
that little house at the beach.
At the end of Carbon Beach
with the blue roof?
- Ok.
- Ok.
You bring--You bring
somebody home with you.
Somebody that I don't know.
Somebody that I'll like.
Ok. I will.
P.A.: United Airlines
flight 1 66 to Boston.
All passengers...
I have to go.
...should now be onboard
at gate 1 8.
You look elegant, Mom.
Oh, look at you.
Ohh...
You never were
a small-town girl, honey.
Thanks for knowing that, Mom.
And wear your seat belt, ok?
Mm-hmm.
Ok. Ok.
And--And make a list of all the books
that you're reading
so I can keep up.
Ok.
I love you.
I love you, too, sweetie.
Bye.
  Be optimistic  
  Don't you be a grumpy 
 When the road gets bumpy 
 Just smile, smile, smile  
  Be happy 
Go! Go ahead!
Ann: Even if you can't stand her,
even if you hate her,
even if she's ruining your life,
there's--there's
something about my mother.
Some romance...
some power.
And when she dies...
the world will be flat.
Too simple, too fair...
too reasonable.
Ooh! Gosh, you pack
quite a wallop.
Oh, excuse me.
Are you ok?
Are you ok?
I'm fine. Thanks.
  Free to find where I belong  
  Free to find myway 
  I know at times
I act a little crazy 
 And I made mistakes along the way 
  But I can see the silver lining  
  It's about to bring a change  
  I have been waiting for 
 Yeah  
  'Cause I'm free  
  Free to find where I belong  
  Free to find myway 
  Free to find myway 
  I want to be free  
  Di di dit di di dit di doo  
  Sometimes  
 Time comes along  
 When it's time to  
 Time to move on  
 You can't stay there  
  No matter how much you want  
 Tears flow  
  Sad words are said  
  But in my heart  
 The story won't end  
 You'll still be there  
  In everything that I do  
 And wherever I go  
  I'll remember you  
  Leaving's not leaving  
  'Cause I'm not leaving you behind  
 You'll always be with me  
 Always be with me  
 And part of my heart  
  For all time  
 Where I'm going  
 You're going  
  Even if it's just in my mind  
  Leaving's not leaving  
  I'm not leaving you behind  
  Moments  
  Share them with you  
 They're the best times  
 That I ever knew  
 They'll still be there  
 When good-byes are all through  
  I'll remember those days  
  I'll remember you  
  Leaving's not leaving  
  'Cause I'm not leaving you behind  
 You'll always be with me  
 Always be with me  
  Part of my heart  
  For all time  
 Where I'm going  
 You're going  
  Even ifit'sjust in my mind  
  Leaving's not leaving  
  I'm not leaving  
 You behind  
  Leaving's not leaving  
  Not leaving you behind  
  Not leaving you behind  
  I'm not leaving you  
  I'm not leaving you behind  
  No, no, no  
  No, no, no  
  I'm not leaving  
  Leaving's not leaving  
  I'm not leaving you  
  I'm not leaving
