I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
And something touched me deep inside
The day the music...
UV radiation high.
Temperature, 150 degrees. Caution.
Body temperature high, 101.2.
Okay. Okay.
Dewey.
So
Bye, bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And them good ole boys
Were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Dewey, bottle.
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Hey, do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music--
Save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me to dance...
Okay.
Someone's going to be happy tonight.
Jesus.
Getting old.
I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck
With a pink carnation
And a pickup truck
Knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
All right. Front's up.
Done.
Okay.
So I was singing
Sorry.
Sorry.
While the king...
Warning. Air pressure drop.
Caution.
Warning. Air pressure drop.
Caution.
No. Oh, shit.
1,500 feet.
1,400 feet.
1,300 feet.
1,200 feet.
-900 feet.
-Come on.
800 feet.
700 feet.
Oh, my God. Come on.
Come on.
600 feet.
400 feet.
{\an8}300 feet.
200 feet.
Warning. Shelter advised.
I'm coming.
100 feet.
Come on.
-80 feet.
-Come on.
60 feet.
-40 feet.
-Here we go.
Okay.
Let's go. I got ya.
Come on!
In!
Okay. Your turn.
Get the eyeballs.
Up with the paw.
Eyes up.
Up. Come on.
All right. See you downstairs.
Hey. I didn't forget about you.
What? Did you miss me? Yes, I missed you.
Yes, I think about you all the time.
Yes, I do. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yes, I'll give you scratches.
That's all I'm here for, right?
Just to scratch you.
Just to scratch you.
Now can we please have
a quiet evening at home tonight?
Hey, cut it out.
Good boy, Dewey.
Okay, okay. Don't worry about me.
Carry on.
Thanks, Dewey.
Oh, hi.
Where's your ball? Is it here?
Is it here? Where's your ball?
Go! Oh! Get it!
All right, you're next.
Come here, dog breath. Come on.
Okay.
Now I'm gonna need your eyes.
I'm sorry, Dewey.
I'll get you new ones. I promise.
And it'll be worth it.
One small step for man...
one giant leap for Finch Weinberg.
Hello.
If you can speak, say "yes."
{\an8}"This device is not responding or not
compatible with the operating system.
Please call technical support
for assistance."
Okay.
Hey.
How about nodding your head?
If you can understand me, nod your head.
No, I don't know why he's not working.
You do-- You do understand?
Do you understand?
Only nod if I ask you a question
that you understand.
Do you understand?
Stop nodding.
You understand.
Stop nodding your head.
You have a friend! Good boy.
Yeah.
Okay, I've done some tweaking.
Not exactly what I had in mind.
It should do for now.
Now, if you can speak, say something.
Calm down.
Something.
Something. Something, indeed.
Indeed.
So...
Tell me something interesting.
Giraffes can survive without water
longer than camels.
Is that a fact?
I bet you didn't know that.
Kangaroo rats can survive
longer than giraffes.
-Okay. Okay, okay.
-Did you know--
Tell me something interesting about you.
I have four primary directives.
What is the first directive?
First directive:
A robot cannot harm a human
or, through inaction,
allow a human to be harmed.
Hey, calm down.
Calm down-- All right, listen to this.
It'll make you feel better.
What about the fourth directive?
Fourth directive:
In Finch's absence,
robot must protect the welfare of dog.
This directive supersedes
all other directives.
You hear that?
So, you understand
how important this dog is to me?
Yes.
So, you know who Finch is?
You are Finch.
Yes.
Now... define absence.
The state of not being present.
Finch...
Yes?
When will you be absent?
Oh, shit.
Oh, sheet.
Hello, dog.
I know 16,000 interesting facts about--
Hello, Finch.
I'm connecting you
to a local weather station.
Tell me when you see it.
Connected.
I need you to use this data
to make a forecast.
Data indicates 15 separate weather events
advancing at 155 miles per hour.
Current data predicts
these events will intersect
over this location
within the next 24 hours.
How long will it last?
Probability these combined events
will create a superstorm is 1.00452--
No. No, I need to know
how long it will last.
Forty days, approximately.
So we need to get
the hell out of St. Louis.
South is out of the question.
Not with the storm season we've had.
As is north, obviously.
And east, too many cities.
You know what that means?
People.
Pass.
So that's that, then.
Head west.
Over the mountains.
Go easy on the rations.
A little bit of luck.
Find places
that haven't been ransacked or looted.
San Francisco.
What do you think?
Yeah, I think it's time.
What are you doing, Finch?
I'm increasing your transfer rate.
It's not what I want,
but we're out of time.
Can you simplify?
If we don't go before that storm hits,
we'll die down here. All of us.
Do you understand?
Yes.
So, as soon as you can walk,
we're leaving.
But, Finch...
if we leave now,
data transfer would only be at 72%.
Well, we can't all be Einstein.
Did you know Albert Einstein
was born with an abnormally large head?
I gave you digital levelers.
And redundant gyros, so...
it's not your balance.
It's your rhythm.
Watch me and imitate. Walking in place.
One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two.
-Good. Good. Stop. Stop.
-One, two. One, two.
All right. All right.
Now, this is walking forward...
One, two. One, two. One, two.
Turning... and one, two.
One, two. One, two.
Understood?
Okay.
All right.
And imitate. Forward.
One, two.
Walking.
Yeah. Good.
And stop.
Turning.
Turning.
Stop.
Stopping.
That's good. Good.
No, here. Hey.
Look.
Walk to me.
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, Finch.
-One, two.
-Now, that's falling.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two. One.
I am walking.
Dewey?
Dewey.
Dewey.
I am okay.
Sorry.
This is a 1984 Fleetwood Southwind.
UV radiation high. Caution.
Hello, dog.
Temperature, 147 degrees.
I know 3,027 interesting facts
about this vehicle.
Would you like me to drive?
No, you just learned how to walk.
Wait, wait. Let me sit down.
Did you know the population of St. Louis
is over 600,000?
Where is everybody?
It's a long story.
Yeah, we should be safe
once we get into the mountains.
Finch, what is our destination?
When I was a kid, these fields
were covered with wildflowers.
Mustard seed, alfalfa.
Color as far as the eye could see.
And in summertime, there were bees.
You would've loved it.
Finch, there is something
hanging out the back of my head.
I know. Don't fiddle with it.
Sorry.
And stop apologizing.
Sorry.
As soon as it's safe to stop,
I'll take a look.
Woof, woof.
UV radiation high. 165 degrees.
Caution.
-Hold still.
-Sorry.
Are these all photographs
of places you have been?
Those are postcards.
For the record, it's rude to rifle
through a man's personal effects.
Postcards.
Like a card sent in the post?
Yes. Yes, people actually used to do that.
Before this thing they call the Internet.
Why?
So friends and family could stay in touch.
Who sent that one?
-Oops.
-What was that?
Nothing. Nothing. Just stop fidgeting.
Sorry.
Who sent you that one?
An uncle in San Francisco.
And this one?
Well, that's the Tower Bridge in London.
And that's
the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.
And that's Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Sydney Harbour?
I would like to see this bridge very much.
Maybe we should
make this our destination, Finch.
Well, Sydney's pretty far away.
Why not something a little closer,
like San Francisco?
How far away is that?
1,811 miles exactly.
Maybe we'll see it together.
There. All done.
Good as new.
Well, we have got to
get this show on the road.
You have a lot to learn.
No, Dewey.
Let's let the big fella have a turn.
Watch me then imitate.
Now, lesson number one...
Lesson number one.
Never pass on the opportunity
for your next meal.
Especially when you have
a hungry dog to feed.
Especially when you have
a hungry dog to feed.
Like that theater there.
You see, the padlocks on the doors
are still intact.
They are still intact.
That means whatever was inside
is still inside.
UV radiation high.
-And lesson number two...
-Caution.
Up there, there are holes in the sky.
It's like Swiss cheese.
-Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.
-Took me awhile to figure that out.
When the flare hit,
it completely fried the ozone,
and then the EMP took out
everything electrical just like that.
It was a good thing I was at work.
What are you doing?
I was locating the cheese.
Come here.
But, Finch,
you said up there it's like Swiss cheese.
-I was locating the cheese.
-Hey, this is not a joke.
I don't wear this UV suit for fun.
This is not a joke.
I don't wear this UV suit for fun.
Why are you imitating me?
You said watch then imitate.
-Stop imitating me.
-Sorry.
And stop apologizing.
Stopping.
Lesson number three is:
Never willfully destroy
somebody else's property.
A little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.
Help me open this door.
Muscle.
That was a little too much muscle.
Can you simplify?
That's a figure of speech.
It's another way of saying something,
like the cheese.
Like the cheese.
Yeah, like the cheese. Except not exactly.
Finch, this is a play
by William Shakespeare.
A dramatic comedy about love,
deception, and other human misunders--
Never really cared for the theater.
Lesson number four:
Use your initiative.
-Finch, do you think this is safe to eat?
-Hold this.
-It is approximately 15 years old.
-Just like that.
Now why do you think
they called it popcorn, huh?
Lesson number five: Live a little.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Again.
Again, again!
Again, again!
Tornado detection. Shelter advised.
Air pressure--
Damn it. I thought it would break up
before it reached this altitude.
Body temperature high, 102.2.
Air pressure drop.
Finch, there is something rattling around
inside of my head.
Shelter advised.
-Tornado warning. Shelter advised.
-Stay. Stay, boy.
Stay. Good dog.
Tornado warning. Shelter advised.
Follow me.
Stay, boy. Stay.
We need to tie the RV down
with these spikes and the winches.
You see what I'm doing?
You need to imitate me exactly.
Understand?
Understand.
1,800 feet.
Shelter advised.
-Make sure there is no slack on the cable.
-No slack.
1,700 feet.
Tornado warning.
Shelter advised.
All right, the next one.
Give me the next one.
-Tornado warning. 1,400 feet.
-I still can't see anything.
-Come on. Oh, my God. Come on.
-Caution. Heart rate high.
You can do this.
You should return
to the recreational vehicle.
1,200 feet.
900 feet.
Hey.
Here. Good. Oh, good.
Shelter advised.
500 feet.
Get back in here.
Come on! Get back in!
We gotta be inside right now!
Shelter advised.
Get in the back.
-The back. The back.
-Dewey! Not you.
300 feet.
Finch, what should I do?
Hang on to something.
-200 feet.
-Who's a good boy?
Holding on, Finch.
50 feet. Extreme caution.
Shelter advised.
I am okay.
Everyone okay?
You good, boy?
Dewey? You?
Thanks. I wondered what happened to that.
This could have gone better.
He used his muscle on that.
Hey. Good job.
Finch.
Damn it.
We have been very fortunate.
Extremely fortunate.
The Fleetwood Southwind
is not known for its safety features.
-Did you know that--
-Did you find the jack?
I have located a spare but no jack.
Great. Shredded tire, no jack.
Mistakes will get you killed, Weinberg.
You should know that by now.
Finch.
Initiative.
All right.
Okay, let her down.
Good.
I really enjoyed being a jack.
You do make a good jack.
You know, we...
We should consider giving you a name.
I would like that very much.
Well, how about Jack?
No, Jack is a tool's name.
How about William Shakespeare?
Will you call me William Shakespeare?
That's taken.
Maybe something a little less complicated.
You know? Keep it simple.
Napoleon Bonaparte.
Napoleon was short.
And what is wrong with being short?
Nothing at all. It's just that
you are not short. You're very tall.
I am very tall.
I like the name Rover.
Rover is a dog's name.
I was thinking of
the early Mars planetary lander.
Okay. Still, maybe something
a little less complicated or appropriate.
Maybe you want something
that's not already a dog's name?
No.
Why doesn't the dog have a name?
He does have a name.
It's Goodyear.
I like that name.
Why not use it? He is your dog after all.
Well, he's not my dog.
He is his own dog.
Besides, with just the two of us,
who needs names?
Jeff.
Jeff?
Jeff.
Jeff. Really?
Have I said something funny?
No. No, absolutely not. No.
It is short and simple.
Yes, it is.
-Just like you suggested, Finch.
-Yeah.
And I've checked.
It isn't a dog's name.
No, it's not. For the life of me,
I cannot ever remember
a dog named Jeff, so...
Then, with your permission, Finch...
None required.
Give me your hand.
Other hand. Corresponding hand.
And shake hands.
Welcome to the world, Jeff.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on with all the fuss?
I thought our communication might improve
if I learn to talk dog.
I have made a comparative analysis.
I believe I have isolated
several root phonetic units.
However, it seems to have misunderstood
everything I have said.
-What is the matter with it, Finch?
-It's not an "it."
It's a "him."
There's no such thing as dog talk.
I don't think it likes me.
Well, he doesn't trust you yet.
That takes time.
Finch, I'm not sure I understand
this concept of trust.
Can you explain for me, please?
Okay. Trust is when we...
Well, trust is how we, you know, trust.
It's...
Well, how about if I tell you a story?
Are you going to tell me
a story about trust?
Well, it's a story about me. All right.
All right, so once upon a time,
back when I was a junior at Tri Alpha,
word came from up top
that I was gonna be put on a team
that was developing the RMS system.
Problem was that I didn't really
like working on a team,
-so I was having some problems--
-Why didn't you like
working on a team, Finch?
Because my team
was a bunch of knuckleheads.
-Put that down. Put that down.
-What's a knuckle--
What's a knucklehead?
I just worked better by myself, okay?
Now listen.
-Listening.
-All right.
Now, we were having real problems
getting the OS to talk to the hardware.
And the team was certain
that it was a hardware issue.
But I knew it wasn't.
It was something else.
And guess who cracked it?
Well, anyway, that doesn't matter.
The next thing I know,
is Doctor Norman Rostoker,
who founded TAE Technologies,
he pays us a visit.
And that is a big deal.
He pats us on the back
and then he singles me out.
He says, "Weinberg."
The man knows my name.
That's right. He said,
"Weinberg, I heard you figured this out
all by yourself. Is that true?"
And I had to think about that
for a minute.
But then I knew what I had to say.
And so I told him
I couldn't have done it without my team.
But you said your team were
a bunch of knuckleheads.
Well, he looked me right in the eye,
and he knew I was lying.
But he also knew I had my team's back.
So he gave me this wink and told us all,
"Teamwork. That's the key."
Teamwork is the key.
-Yeah.
-Wink, wink.
That's right.
That's right.
I'm not sure I understand
what the story was about, Finch.
-Well, think about it.
-I am.
It's about building trust
and getting other people to trust you.
Yes, but you didn't actually
trust your team, Finch.
And I found the story
quite hard to follow.
May I suggest--
Finch.
Finch, would you like me to drive?
-UV radiation detected, 141 degrees.
-I just need a few minutes.
I want you two...
to start working on...
that trust.
-Okay?
-Like in the story?
Yeah, yeah. Just like in the story.
Stay in the shade.
Come on.
Come on.
-Hey, no.
-Come on.
No. No, no, not that way.
-Come on.
-Come on.
Come here. Okay, okay.
Give me this. Give me this.
Hey, come on, boy. Come on.
There you go. Yeah.
I told you he doesn't like me.
You just stay here.
Guard the fort.
What should we have?
Get your elbows off the table.
Get your elbows off the table.
Off the table. Down.
Mac and cheese.
I'm gonna get a triple-decker turkey club.
Shit.
Stay.
Hey!
No! Hey, hey, come. Hey.
Come here. Good, good, good.
Stay.
Hey, what's going on, Jeff?
Nothing.
Did you just drive the RV?
No.
No?
It did roll though.
Oh, okay. Good.
Because I don't think you're quite ready
to drive the RV yet.
I have seen you drive.
Are you upset?
I need you to listen to me, okay?
Okay.
I want you to fetch the UV suit
and bring it to me.
The helmet, the cooling unit,
everything, okay?
Okay.
Is that understood?
Understood.
No, no! No!
No!
No, no!
No!
I meant on foot!
No, stop! Stop!
I am an excellent driver.
Come here.
UV doesn't discriminate.
Dog skin, human skin, they both fry.
-I thought you wanted me--
-You have one job to do.
Take care of this dog.
It's the reason I made you.
It's the only reason you exist.
The fourth directive.
I don't need companionship.
I don't need a friend.
I need you to do your job.
I'm sorry. I am--
I know you were born yesterday,
but it's time for you to grow up!
God's honest truth, you were
a crazy gamble from start to finish.
You just need to understand
how vulnerable we are.
What do you think?
Now is as good a time as any.
What for?
Now gently. Very gently.
Give it just a little gas.
Don't rush it.
Just very gently.
That's not gently.
-Sorry.
-You know what gently means.
Easy.
Easy now. Easy.
Easy.
Don't oversteer.
Yeah, you've oversteered.
That's oversteering.
-Sorry.
-Ease your foot up just a hair.
Good.
Good.
All right. Now keep it steady,
just like this.
Perfect.
I know-- Eyes on the road.
Now, she's a little thirsty,
but I made some modifications.
So if we can keep it steady,
under 50, we should be okay.
Good. Yeah.
I am an excellent driver.
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.
Eyes on the road.
See, rain man? You're just an apprentice.
Then I am an excellent apprentice.
San Francisco, here we come!
What a cold night. It's been a long time.
Finch.
It's the aurora borealis.
Yeah?
Only now you don't have to be
in Alaska to see it.
You can thank the flare for that.
Goodbye, ozone.
Goodbye, feeling the sun on your face.
Vegetation and crops and food.
Goodbye, everything.
And yet, here we are.
Yes.
Here we are, Finch.
May I ask you something?
If daylight is so dangerous,
why are we not traveling at night?
You think if traveling at night were safe,
I wouldn't know that by now?
Where are we headed?
The Golden Gate Bridge.
Into the unknown.
Dust and smoke and 150-degree heat
and UV radiation, that I can handle.
Why?
Why?
Because it's predictable.
Moving at night presents
that which is not predictable.
People.
Starving people hiding in the shadows.
People who mean you harm.
People you cannot trust.
But why? How do you know
you can't trust those people?
Because trust will get you killed.
Trust no one.
You're mad at me again.
Look, things will happen to you.
Things that you cannot control.
Raw emotion will find you.
When it does, how you deal with it,
what you do...
will define who you are.
Did that happen to you?
It happens to all of us.
Whether we want it to or not.
It's too cold.
Too cold for these old bones.
Finch, I think I might stay here awhile
if that's okay with you.
Okay.
Okay.
You're unwell.
What would you like me to do?
Call a doctor.
Good boy. Stay.
Come on, Dewey.
Let's get this show on the road.
Lesson number one:
Never pass on the opportunity
for your next meal.
Lesson number two...
Never willfully destroy
another person's property.
But a little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.
That's a figure of speech, by the way.
Come, Dewey.
Lesson number three:
Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.
UV radiation high, 144 degrees.
Caution.
Hey.
Stay here.
Guard the fort.
Oh, no.
Lesson number four: Use your initiative.
Medicine.
Medicine.
Initiative.
Lesson number five: Live a little.
Not bad.
Stay, boy.
Initiative, initiative,
initiative, initiative!
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, Dewey.
Come on.
Finch.
Do you like my new coat?
What are you doing?
Have you listened to me at all?
But-- But initiative, Finch.
Initiative requires common sense.
If you had any, you'd know
there's something wrong with this place.
Finch, do you think--
Walk away now.
Finch.
Where's Dewey?
Dewey's gone.
Heart rate high, 150 bpm.
The door. Get the door.
Caution.
Heart rate high.
Here, take this.
-Caution.
-Now come take the wheel.
Body temperature high, 104.8.
Blood pressure high.
-May I make a suggestion--
-No!
No, you may not. That was a trap
and you walked right into it.
Dewey was one of us and now he's gone
all because of your stupid mistake.
-Caution. Heart rate high.
-Come on, boy.
Come on. Here, boy. Come on, boy. Go. Go.
From now on, there's a new set of rules.
No more mistakes.
We can't afford that anymore.
What would you like me to do?
Drive. We need the miles.
Are you okay?
We're being followed.
We are?
By who?
I don't want to find out.
You can still see, right?
I can see.
We-- We have to lose him.
Floor it. Floor it.
Put your foot on the gas.
-But the Fleetwood manual says--
-Do it. Just do it. Do it now!
Go. Go! Go faster.
May I make a suggestion, Finch?
-We have to get off this road.
-What are you doing?
-Overpass. That means an underpass.
-I don't understand.
Now. Now! Hard left!
Go. Go! Why are you stopping?
We have to hide! Go!
We have to go now!
-Finch, I think--
-Now! Go!
Finch.
Maximum height of
this particular underpass
is 13 feet and 7 inches.
With the basic customizations
of the vehicle, we're--
Finch!
-Finch?
-What have I done?
No! No, Jeff!
I think they're gone, Finch.
We're not gonna make it.
It's over.
I'm too old. I'm too sick.
I'm too tired. I'm done.
Finch, it's gonna rain.
You know what that means--
Stop it. Stop it. Just accept it.
It's over.
No.
We can't give up.
I will not allow you to give up.
You will not allow it?
Well, you don't get to decide
because you're just a machine.
A robot cannot harm a human or,
through inaction,
allow a human to come to harm.
Shut up!
May I ask you something?
Do you think we'll make it
to the Golden Gate Bridge?
I think we will.
You wanna know why?
Because I believe in you, Finch.
Can I tell you a story?
Okay.
Once upon a time...
there was a solar flare.
But the flare didn't finish us off.
We did that to ourselves.
Some people hid and locked their doors.
Tried to pretend
that it wasn't really happening.
And they didn't last very long.
The rest of us did what we had to do
to survive.
We scavenged and we fought over
whatever was left behind
until there was nothing left.
I was searching this supermarket.
And the place had been
pretty well cleaned out,
but occasionally something gets overlooked
and you get lucky.
And I found a bag of noodles.
But before I could leave...
this mother and her kid show up,
and they have a shopping cart
filled with their things.
The little girl couldn't have been
more than nine years old.
She had a pink unicorn backpack.
And she was holding a gun in her hands.
And I heard the mom say,
"Remember, if you see anyone,
you point at them
and you do like I showed you, okay?"
And then I realized that if she sees me,
this little girl's gonna shoot me
and take my noodles.
So I hid.
And waited until they were done.
But as they were leaving,
this station wagon pulled up.
And the driver got out
because he'd seen the little girl.
And he was yelling,
and he was waving a shotgun around
like a crazy man.
He'd seen the cart
and he wanted what was in it.
So he was hollering,
"Hand it over. Hand it over."
And then the mom ran up
and she was yelling at him,
"Leave us alone."
And the little girl is terrified and...
she didn't know where to point the gun.
She was crying.
And they were both screaming.
And then bang, bang, bang.
It all happened so fast.
By the time he left
and I was able to get to them,
it was too late.
Then I heard this sound.
This tiny whimpering...
coming from the girl's pink backpack.
And so I opened it.
And there was this shivering,
tiny, little thing.
So frightened.
And so alone.
Hunger turned men into murderers.
But made...
made me a coward.
How can you believe in that?
You see that?
San Francisco.
Finch.
Only 480 miles.
"Dad."
Dad.
UV radiation low. Non-critical.
I think you need to come and see this.
-Finch!
-What?
-What?
-Right there.
I didn't mean to hit it.
I thought you said it...
Swiss cheese.
I don't know.
This is excellent, Jeff.
This is the best meal I've had
in a long, long time.
Guess what?
What?
I saw it in my head last night.
In your head?
The three of us were on
the Golden Gate Bridge,
like a painting that hasn't been yet.
Wow!
Jeff, you had a dream?
That blows my mind.
I would love to see you
five or six years from now.
I'm not a disappointment?
Of course not. No.
And I shouldn't have called you a machine.
May I ask you something?
You said that the Golden Gate Bridge card
was from your uncle,
but on the back it's signed "Dad."
Why is that?
Boy, you don't miss a thing, do you?
No, I don't.
Well, I think it's time for another story.
Well...
My mom always said my dad
had Viking blood in him.
You didn't say, "Once upon a time."
Okay. And once upon a time...
he left us.
It was before I was born.
He was in the army.
An engineer of some kind, evidently.
Built bridges.
And he was always traveling.
We never had any contact.
And then on my 15th birthday,
that postcard shows up out of the blue.
The one with the Golden Gate Bridge.
And he wrote on it
he hoped we could meet one day.
Meantime I was supposed to
go off and see the world.
And he signed it "Dad" and I treasured it.
In fact, as soon as I was old enough,
I went out and I bought this fancy suit.
And I thought, well,
when we finally do meet,
I wanted to impress him
and make him feel proud of me.
Never heard from him again.
And did you?
Did I what?
Did you go see the world?
Well, I went to New York City once.
-Yeah?
-I didn't much care for it.
It was crowded and dirty.
And apart from that I've never been
much further than Missouri.
But there was always something.
You know, my health or my work,
Mom, the end of the world.
Yeah, I...
I just never got around to it.
What about the other postcards?
Why are they all blank?
Well, whenever I saw one I liked,
I would buy it.
You know, sort of a collection.
Something for the bucket list, I guess.
I don't know.
Like, we humans
are full of contradictions.
You see, you can already tell me
how many rivets
are in the Golden Gate Bridge.
And how many miles of cable were used
and how high it is.
But it's not until you actually
stand on it and see the beauty,
and listen to the suspension cables
singing in the wind...
That's experience.
That's human experience.
It's not just imagining, it's living.
But you've never actually been
to the Golden Gate Bridge, Finch.
No, Jeff, I've never been.
Thank you.
Like I said,
humans are full of contradictions.
I wish I'd done more with the time I had.
Well, then let's leave right now, Finch!
We'll leave right now.
And if we leave right now,
it'll only be 18 hours, 33 minutes--
I'm dying, Jeff.
I'm gonna die.
When I'm gone...
do you promise
to do what's right for Goodyear?
Where's your ball?
Is it here? Is that your ball?
Is that your ball?
Is that your ball?
Where's your ball? Where's your ball?
Go! Get it.
Come on. All right. Okay.
Now you try it.
Yeah. Yeah. You throw it.
Go ahead. Throw it.
This kind of stuff's important.
Where's your ball?
Where's your ball? Is it here? Is it here?
Just throw it.
Is this your ball?
Is this your ball?
-Throw the ball.
-Here, boy.
Where's your ball?
Throw the ball.
Come on!
Hey, Finch!
Yeah.
Here, boy!
Come on, boy. No.
-Again.
-But he returned it to you.
Well, that's 'cause dogs
are creatures of habit.
Here, boy!
Come on.
Please?
Do it.
Good boy. Good--
I told you he doesn't like me.
You two will-- You'll figure it out.
Come on. Trust me.
Look what I did to ruin my fancy suit.
I got you.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Try and breathe, Finch. Try and breathe.
I'm just gonna lay down for a while.
You two play.
You two go.
-Go play.
-Can I do something, Finch?
Jeff, you already have.
Shake my hand.
No.
No.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
What are you gonna do, Jeff?
What would Finch do?
He'd feed the dog.
I'm gonna feed the dog.
Oh, shit.

That's human experience.
Looks like we're not the only ones
who came this way.
You think they're still out there?
Well, there's only one way to find out.
It's beautiful.
Finch knew what he was talking about.
Hey, how about a story?
Okay, so once upon a time...
