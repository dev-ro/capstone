Chul Woo?
Chul Woo?
Wake up.
It's time to collect the nets.
You have to wake up.
Come on, now.
It's cold outside.
Here you go.
Is it torn?
Why are you laughing?
Nothing.
Tell me.
What's so funny?
I think you look...
...handsome in the morning.
Is that so?
I can be more charming.
- What are you doing?
- Come here.
You'll wake her up!
Beautiful girl.
How old is she?
She's 7 now.
Same age as my daughter.
Is that so?
You might have hard time seeing
because of the fog.
- Don't get too far away.
- I won't.
There's a strong current
towards the South, stay away from there.
Alright.
Comrade!
Just out of curiosity...
What would you do
if your boat gets dragged to the South?
Would you jump into the water?
- This boat is all I have.
- So?
- Will you go to South Korea?
- I will never go there.
I'm here to earn a living.
What is he doing?
This is Post 26th.
Fishing boat is moving towards the South.
We are not sure
if he's going there on purpose.
Help!
Comrade Nam Chul Woo!
Come back!
- What's happening?
- He's over there, commander.
He's drifting away.
Shall we catch the boat?
You're too late!
He's heading towards the border.
Aim the gun.
Shoot him if he passes the border.
- His boat might be broken.
- Shoot him!
A fisherman living in this area
must be aware of the rules.
- Are you sure, commander?
- Yes.
If we shoot him while he's in the
South border, a war might break out.
I'll shoot him.
Can't he come back if his engine is broken?
His family is here.
Damn it!
Let's go to his house.
This is Post 13th,
I'm listening.
There's a boat drifting
50 meters ahead. Check it out.
Yes, sir!
Don't move!
What are you doing here?
- My engine is broken!
- North Korean.
The Net
Translated by: cRosKy
Where are you taking me?
We are almost in Seoul.
Why did you close your eyes?
I can't see anything
until I go back to the North.
Why?
Are you afraid
the police will question you?
I belong in the North!
Look, across there. Our tallest
building. Exactly 100 floors.
World's fifth tallest building.
Open your eyes.
We are underground.
I didn't see anything.
We know...
Come on, open your eyes.
Empty your pockets, please.
Take a shower.
Is it necessary?
You think I'm hiding something?
This is the procedure.
I'm not a spy!
- Where are my clothes?
- We got rid of them.
Why the hell would you
throw away my clothes?
We'll give you new clothes.
Your belongigs are in your room.
You didn't even ask me!
I'm only following the orders.
- Sorry. Wear these.
- Bring my own clothes!
- Wear them, come on.
- Who are you?
I'm Agent Jin Woo.
I'm responsible for protecting you.
You mean to keep an eye on,
not to protect.
Feel free to think that way
but I'm suposed to protect you.
I'll be waiting outside.
Is this the guy?
He looks like a spy.
Please send me back home.
You must be questioned for not
entering the country legally.
Nets got stuck in the engine.
- It's not right for you to question me.
- You may think that way.
If I were to enter North Korea,
would they let me off?
But I'm not a spy.
I'll be the one to decide
whether you're a spy or not.
What's your name?
What's your name?!
Nam Chul Woo.
Your age?
I'm 37 years old.
Your address?
South Hwanghae District,
Bupo Village.
Write down your life.
- Starting with your birth.
- Why?
Do what I tell you.
- His engine broke down?
- Yes.
Nets got stuck in the engine.
He didn't stop it.
We must make sure
he's not here as a spy.
If not, let him stay here.
We can't allow him
to go back to dictatorship.
Come on in.
- In case you want to look outside...
- I can't! Close it!
- There's no air inside.
- I said, don't! Close the curtain!
Our leader Kim Jong Un
cried during a martyr funeral.
- He said he'll never be forgotten.
- Yes, yes. It's quite said.
Were you able to sleep well?
I know you were watching me.
- What would you like to eat?
- I have no money.
You don't have to pay.
Everything is for free.
Choose something from the menu.
What do you think about this one? Alright.
Enjoy.
Eat.
Don't be shy.
I'll ask again.
Why did the engine got broken?
I already told you. Nets got stuck in it.
I wrote it in my statement.
Answer my question.
Please, let me go back home.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You entered the demilitarized zone.
- What were you looking for?
- Bullshit!
The engine is toasted.
It will take a long time to fix it.
Isn't that weird?
Why did you burn the engine?
Because I tried to get rid of the nets
by running the engine.
So that it will take a long time
to get it fixed?
Another spy managed to escape
by using the same tactic.
You look suspicious
under these conditions.
Just let me be.
Are you into sports?
You look fit.
Like everyone else.
Were you in the army?
Where did you serve?
Special Forces?
Come on, tell me.
I need to pee.
You can go.
Let me assist you.
It's me.
Why did you do that?
Don't move!
Son of a bitch!
You're screwed.
Cuff him.
You're indeed
from the Special Forces.
Confess!
Tell me, now!
- I was in the eighth division.
- That's what I thought.
I did my military service.
You don't seem to be
an ordinary soldier.
I can take down five men,
even without a gun.
Are you putting on a show?
Alright, tell me the location of your base
and the names of the commanders.
- That's a private information.
- Son of a bitch!
- You're not following the procedure!
- He's a spy!
My job is to protect him.
Perhaps he's not a spy. Don't harm him!
He's from the eighth division.
Special Forces. Don't you get it?
It doesn't mean he's a spy!
You're making a mistake, just like
last year's case.
He's no different than Lee Sang Taek.
We're in trouble because of him.
- How could you forget?!
- Question him, instead of beating him!
Otherwise I will report you.
Alright...
But if he's a spy...
...I will kill you.
- Okay.
I will quit my job
if he turns out to be a spy.
Alright. We'll see...
Let's move.
You should be ashamed of
what you're doing.
I don't need your opinion.
So, now...
Write your entire background.
Starting from your birth.
Why do I have to write it down?
You lied about the military.
I don't trust you.
Write everything about the eighth division.
I want names.
Write it!
Go away.
Get out!
- Put on medicine.
- I don't need it.
- It will get infected.
- I don't give a damn.
Don't worry. It will hurt even more
if it gets infected.
Thank you.
I will lose my job
if I'm mistaken about you.
I swear, I'm not a spy.
All I care about is my family.
I have to take care of them.
Rest a little bit.
Tomorrow will be rough.
Things you wrote today
are different than yesterday's.
- We have to talk.
- You can continue tomorrow.
The investigator here is me,
not you.
Get up!
Bring him in.
Your questioning will continue
throughout the night.
I came here because my boat broke down.
Why do you torture me like this?
I'm tired as well.
Just answer my questions.
Without lies.
You've mentioned Pyongyang today,
but it wasn't there yesterday.
What are you hiding?
I forgot yesterday. Everything I wrote
is the truth. I just remembered today.
Is your memory changing every day?
Humans can make such mistakes.
A single sentence can prove
that you're a spy.
I'm not a spy.
I pity you.
- Write again.
- I've been writing for four hours!
Never again!
I said, write it.
If not, you won't be sleeping tonight.
Let him sleep.
You've been hard on him.
My job is to question him.
You do your job.
Your father's date of death is different.
When did he die?
- In November or December?
- Enough!
I said, enough!
Let me be, you son of a bitch!
I was named the iron fist
of the eighth division!
I can kill a man with a single punch!
- Son of a bitch!
- Stop it! Chul Woo, calm down!
Calm down!
- Please don't!
- Let me go!
I will get out of here!
Let me go!
- Let me go!
- Catch the communist!
- Let me go! I want to go home!
- Shut up!
Move!
Cuff him!
Let me go.
Don't move.
Get out!
I said get out!
Don't.
Iron fist, you said?
Now we're talking.
Did they choose you as a spy?
Do you need a spy?
Yes.
Come on, confess.
You'd go to jail for a few years
and then train others to be spies.
Here, you can earn enough money.
Why insist on dictatorship?
Will you prefer living in hell instead?
How many spies did you create?
Don't ask questions.
Just answer me.
I'm the one to decide.
You won't get out
if you don't listen to me.
You're the devil.
I will win.
Alright.
Let's wait and see.
- What did you do?
- Don't you dare butt in!
You son of a bitch!
Is he really a spy?
Every single one of them has a potential.
He must be.
Potential?
Tell me the truth.
Did you find any evidence?
Not yet, sir.
Are you gonna torture him?
That's the absolute solution.
- First you must find a proof.
- Not unless we force it.
I don't think he's a spy.
I heard you were
really tough on the man.
He's just a guard.
What does he know?
Are you acting like this
because of Lee Sang Taek's case?
Are you seeking revenge?
Send him to the questioning team.
No.
I'd like to continue.
Catching spies makes me happy.
Catch a real spy,
don't create a fake one.
Did you forget the last one?
People are already on the edge.
Exactly.
Those damn ignorant communists...
Forget about Nam Chul Woo.
Question the North Korean
that came from Vietnam.
What?
I won't write anymore.
I won't.
As you please.
Get the hell out of here.
I said, get out, bastard.
- Wait and see.
- See what?
I will get my revenge.
Because I hit you?
How will you get your revenge?
You will see
the day I walk out of this place.
What?
Let's go.
Come on in.
Is it done yet?
There's one more step.
Is my boat ready?
- It will take three days.
- Why does it take so long?
My family is in danger!
Alright.
I'll try to help.
Drink it.
You must be exhausted.
I apologize on behalf of everyone.
Our job is no different than
looking for something in the fog.
Can I go back to my country now?
Do you have to go?
What do you mean?
We know the conditions
in North Korea are tough.
You ended up coming here
after your boat broke down.
Perhaps you should see this
as a chance given to you by God.
Please read this.
Citizenship Proposal
You say that I should defect?
There are many advantages.
You'll have a home,
a job and a good salary.
Then...
Can you bring my family to the South?
You can start a new family here.
- If you'd like to marry...
- Look.
Even animals don't leave their flock.
How could humans be this coldhearted?
We feel ashamed that
you're forced to live under dictatorship.
Our purpose is to save people
from that regime.
No.
Have you ever been in my country?
You didn't see anything.
How could you know that
we are unhappy?
Because they brainwash all of you...
You don't know
what real freedom feels like.
I haven't been brainwashed!
I didn't have any problems
before coming here.
What can I say...
This is a once in a lifetime chance.
Think about it.
That's enough.
Stop it! Stop playing games!
I'll go back to my country!
He's a stubborn man.
However, we cannot
send him back to dictatorship.
Do you have any other idea?
Should be let him free?
- Free?
- Yes.
Maybe then he would ask for citizenship.
True...
True.
I can't.
You have no choice.
It's been decided.
Don't you think it's too cruel?
Do we have to take him away
from his family?
Would you be able to
leave your family behind?
I'm not asking for permission.
I only follow the orders.
Listen to my words.
Take him out as if you're going somewhere,
and leave him alone.
Act natural.
Understood?
I will take care of the rest.
He'll want to go back to his country.
In case he doesn't change his mind,
then we will fail.
Just follow my orders, understood?
Comrade, where are you from?
Me?
Hwanghae Province.
I come from the North as well.
My name is Lee Du Chun.
My father was from the North as well.
What are you doing here?
Nice to meet you... However,
I can't talk now.
Can you do me a favor?
My daughter is living in Seoul.
However, I may not be able to see her.
Could you give her a message for me?
I'd like to, but I'll go back.
I can't stay in Seoul any longer.
Then you can ask the other comrades.
Look for Azalea. At the famous
soup restaurant near central station.
Tell her that...
"Seven azaleas bloom in May.
Give three to the swallow."
"Give two to the deer.
Give last two to the flounder."
Let's move if you're done.
Find Azalea.
Is it done now?
Can I go back to my country
if my boat is fixed?
Yes.
But we have to go somewhere tomorrow.
Are they gonna question me?
It has nothing to do with questioning.
Don't worry.
Your records are clear.
They will let you go.
Would you like to visit Seoul
before leaving the country?
Yes, but...
...I can't.
I shouldn't.
I shouldn't see anything
so that I don't know anything.
I'm afraid of what I wrote down.
The government finds out everything.
Will I be in trouble
for talking about the eighth division?
I'm afraid.
I can't look around because of that.
No way.
I can't.
Open the door!
Catch him!
"Seven azaleas bloom in May.
Give three to the swallow."
"Give two to the deer.
Give last two to the flounder."
Come here!
Take him back!
Don't!
He'll kill himself!
- Stop it!
- Stop doing it!
Stop!
He's dead.
Son of a bitch...
What's going on?
Did he commit suicide?
He was a spy.
After we found out about what
he's done in China, he wanted to escape.
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I will get evidence from China.
I don't want any more troubles.
Hurry up.
Yes, sir.
It's cold outside.
Take my hat.
You look nice.
Let me know when we go to the city.
Don't be afraid. Open your eyes.
No one will know.
But I will know.
Then my family would be in danger.
I'll keep it a secret.
This is your last chance to see the city.
Do you want me to get in trouble?
No. I won't tell anyone
what you saw.
But if I see, I will remember.
If I get questioned, I will tell.
Those agents are scary.
By the way, the man that died...
Was he a spy?
Chinese police proves him
being a spy...
...with hard evidence.
I heard that
people do anything for money in China.
How could you know it's not fake?
We can get off.
- Are we inside or outside?
- We're on the street.
Then help me get into some place.
Alright.
Come on.
Are we inside?
Yes, this is it.
It's so crowded.
Take me inside.
- Wait a little bit.
- Don't go, comrade.
Will you leave me here?
Come on.
Open your eyes.
I'll get arrested if I look around.
Do whatever you want, then.
Comrade Jin Woo! Wait!
Comrade Jin Woo! Don't go!
Comrade Jin Woo!
Comrade Jin Woo!
Did you see?
Yes, he's very stubborn.
We must stop.
He can't last any longer.
No.
Continue.
What you're doing is wrong.
I can't continue anymore.
The squad will help him.
Wait a little.
How?
He can't even open his eyes!
Just watch.
Where are you going?
- Hold on to me, let me help.
- No, I don't need help.
Wait, wait.
Did you see a man with a blue tie?
- A tie?
- Yes, a tie.
Tie?
A blue tie.
- I don't see anyone.
- No?
- I don't see him.
- Where did he go?
Comrade Jin Woo!
Stop hiding!
Come out.
Yes, sir.
Comrade Jin Woo!
- I apologize.
- Comrade Jin Woo!
A thief!
Catch him!
He looks dumbfounded.
He'll get used to it.
Hopefully he can manage.
I won't defect!
It's enough!
Come out!
Will you let me escape?
Do you rely on this thing?
Don't run away!
We've lost him!
- He played us.
- What?
Don't you get it?
No, he's not a spy.
- Don't be stupid and come back.
- He will come back.
- What's going on?
- We have a problem, sir.
I'm sorry.
Where's the famous soup restaurant?
You'll see after that corner.
Thank you.
Catch her!
Come here!
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?
Let me go.
- Did you think you could run?
- Let me go! Help me!
Let the woman go.
Help!
Save me!
Who are you?
What are you doing to that woman?
Fuck off.
Mind your business.
- Let's go.
- Take care of your own self.
Put it on.
Thank you.
Yes, sir?
Why aren't you coming back?
I will wait for a little while.
He won't come back.
Come on, drink.
Cheers.
Would you like soup?
Yes, please.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Is life that hard...
...in a free country?
Free?
That's what you think.
I have no money.
I have to sell my body.
They give a house and a job
to all defectors.
Let's get married.
I'll live with you.
I can cook and clean.
Please don't.
We just met.
You don't know me.
I understood you, though.
You're a good man.
I'm sick and tired of living this way.
I want to die.
I should better get going.
Okay.
And I'll go back to my useless life.
Can I use your phone?
Mom, it's me.
Don't worry.
I'm okay.
Did you receive the money?
I'll send more.
Let me talk to Min Soo.
Wake her up.
I want to hear her voice.
Min Soo!
Sorry for waking you up.
Were you studying?
You must go to the university now!
You can do it!
Take care of yourself.
Thank you.
I work at the club in the corner.
Can you write it on my tab?
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come to the club
if you want to sleep with me.
I'll make you happy.
Wait. Where's the
famous soup restaurant?
It's in the corner.
The soup is delicious.
Good evening.
Is this the famous soup restaurant?
Yes.
Is Azalea here?
Azalea!
He's looking for you.
Thank you.
How do you know my father?
We've met recently
but he asked for a favor.
I knew he came to the country.
They must be questioning him now.
Did something happen?
I'm not sure.
I just came to deliver a message.
Is he dead?
So, he is.
Okay.
What's the message?
Your father is dead.
Aren't you sad at all?
I am sad.
However, it doesn't mean
that I have to cry about it.
What did he say?
I don't remember exactly.
Seven azaleas bloom in May.
Give three to the swallow.
Give two to the deer.
Give last two...
- ...to the flounder?
- Exactly.
Is it his favourite poem?
Drink your soup.
It's better while it's warm.
Azalea!
Where are you going?
Thank you for believing in me.
Thank you for coming back.
Chief.
Aren't you coming back?
He's here.
Beside me.
- What did you say?
- Send a car.
Comrade... Can I ask you something?
Sure.
I met a girl by chance.
She was very beautiful.
However, she's selling her body
to earn money.
Isn't there any other job
she can do in this country?
I heard her phone call. She's kind,
and takes care of her family.
When the light is great,
your shadow grows big.
Freedom does not guarantee happiness.
I saw people throwing away
delicious food.
If they save a little bit...
...everything would be better.
I feel ashamed of this.
Why do you feel ashamed?
The country is fertile.
People are happy.
Everybody has a cellphone.
They eat whatever they like.
Would you like to stay
for these opportunities?
No, I don't want to.
My family is more important
than a luxurious life.
Of course.
I know you're thinking about me.
I can ever repay your kindness.
I'm sorry.
After losing you,
I thought you were a spy.
I was tired of being followed.
That's why I ran away.
My grandfather was born in North Korea.
He missed his land throughout his life.
Just like you, he spoke with an accent.
He was also as funny as you.
- I hope you can go back.
- Don't mock me.
I will welcome you in my home
after peace is established.
Alright.
I hope so.
What did you do for three hours?
Is it important?
In the end, I came back, didn't I?
Three hours is a long time to
carry out your mission.
I didn't meet anyone.
Is that so?
What did you do for three hours then?
I met a beautiful woman.
A woman?
Let me take over.
Tell me.
What did you do?
I don't want to speak with you.
Neither do I,
you fucking communist.
- Your mouth smells like shit.
- Shut up.
What did you do out there?
Did he meet the spy?
- It seems so.
- No. Then he wouldn't have come back.
True.
Spies don't come here
for a single message.
That's strange.
While you were headed for soup,
you saw gangsters beating a woman.
You helped her out by beating them.
Is that so?
Correct.
She asked for your help,
so you stayed with her.
Is that all?
What did you do at the soup place?
You met this girl.
Her codename is Azalea.
Her codename?
- Is she a spy?
- What did you do there?
I just had a bowl of soup.
What did you two talk about?
- That's none of your business.
- Answer me. What did you talk about?
- I sent her a message.
- From whom?
From the comrade that committed suicide.
Was he a spy?
What was the message?
- A poem.
- What poem?
Seven azaleas bloom in May.
Give three to the swallow.
Give two to the deer.
Give last two to the flounder.
- Is it a poem?
- I don't know. I just memorized it.
What are you doing?
Aren't you done questioning me?
What are you doing?
Stop it!
I don't know anything!
I don't know anything!
I swear!
He's a spy.
My investigation is finished!
Let me go!
- I'm not sure.
- I don't know anything!
- Go on with questioning.
- Should I torture him?
- Torture?
- As much as necessary, sir.
Let me go!
I'll go back to my country!
You! You would resign
if he turned out to be a spy. Go on.
He didn't know!
They used him!
Pull yourself together! Whose side
will you be on in case of a war?
Choose your side!
Open the door!
Open the door!
- Chief.
- What is it?
He locked the door
and started beating him.
- He was suspicious.
- He's not a spy. I'm sure of it.
If he files a complaint...
...you'll be in trouble as well, sir.
Stand up.
Sit down.
Write down what I say.
Start.
"I met spy Lee Du Chun..."
...and I got orders from him."
- That was not an order.
Continue.
"I met Azalea at the famous
soup restaurant and gave her the message."
I'm not a spy.
Stop playing around.
Write down everytihng and sign it.
- I'm not guilty.
- I said, write it down.
If I sign it...
...will I be a spy?
If you write it down and sign it,
I'll send you home.
Will you really send me back to my country?
Yes.
Write and sign it.
We fixed your boat.
You'll go back to your family.
Write it.
"I met spy Lee Du Chun..."
You've been through a lot.
No, don't sign it.
Come on in.
You are no longer a free man
for threatening our country by being a spy.
What does that mean?
You're a spy.
- You can't go anywhere.
- But...
...you promised to send me home.
Wait!
Don't go!
Comrade Jin Woo, I'm not a spy!
I know Chul Woo! Don't worry,
I will save you!
- Is that so? Get out! Take him!
- Let him go!
- Comrade Jin Woo! Comrade Jin Woo!
- Let me go!
What the hell are you doing?
How can you turn an innocent man
into a spy?
He conveyed a message
to another spy.
He confessed it.
You forced him! You know damn well
that he is not a spy!
He's a potential spy.
My job is to catch them.
Bullshit.
Did you forget about
the Cho Sun Cheol case?
After running of resources, he
ran away to China with stolen information.
It's not the same!
You will see that
my instincts are correct.
I know you lost your family
during the Korean War.
Then why do you
keep trying to butt in?
This is different.
I beg you.
Let him go.
- What the hell? Go away.
- Let him go back to his country.
Go away!
As far as I understand...
...you insist on
making him a spy by force.
I caught him like a mad dog.
What do you mean to say?
You're the one acting like a mad dog.
We can't call him a spy
because of a simple message.
Am I wrong?
We lost everything because of that message.
All the spies are hiding.
It doesn't mean
you have to brand him a spy.
So, will he be free?
Of course not.
Convince him to
accept the citizenship proposal.
Will you give him a salary
so that he continue being a spy?
Think about your country
and your future first.
- Not about taking your family's revenge!
- Who said it was about revenge?!
Dumbasses.
Listen to me carefully.
As of now, you're a spy.
You will be prosecuted
and be punished accordingly.
What you're doing is injustice.
What did I do to deserve it?
- I'm innocent.
- There's one way out.
Should I defect?
Yes.
So, I should betray my land...
...and forget about my family?
You must decide until tomorrow.
I don't need to think.
The answer is simple.
What do you mean?
I want to know one thing.
If I don't defect...
...can't I go back to my life?
I have one last wish.
I'd like to talk to Jin Woo.
In my country...
...I caught many fish in the river.
- And now the net is around my own neck.
- Don't give up.
Once the fish is caught on the net,
its life is over.
I'd like to thank you.
What do you mean?
Chul Woo.
Chul Woo.
I have a bad feeling.
- What happened?
- Chul Woo is saying goodbye.
Does he wish to die?
He would do anything to protect his family.
People don't die that easily.
Keep an eye on him.
What is it?
- Move! Move!
- What are you doing?
- Where is the key?
- Dedective has it.
He's gonna kill himself!
What?
What is he doing?
Open the door!
Help me!
Chul Woo!
Chul Woo!
Let's save him! Chul Woo!
Please stop!
Stupid men.
When they're in danger...
...they want to bite off
their tongues and escape.
How can you say that?
You're not a human!
You little prick.
You planned it, didn't you?
- What's going on?
- I apologize.
He's alright now.
You pushed him too far.
What if he managed to die?
We are surrounded by reporters
since the last case, don't you know it?
- He's a potential spy.
- That's enough! Stop it!
Sir, they are aware of his day in Seoul.
They asked for the footage.
No way. If the North finds out,
they won't let him live.
Don't let him go back.
Why are you so cruel?
What are you saying?
Everything will be worse
if he goes back.
Did you forget about our purpose?
We are trying to save
more and more people from the dictatorship.
However, we must respect their choices.
Respect?
They're all brainwashed.
Why should we show them respect?
But...
...I'm suffering as well.
Don't you know it?
As long as I obtain this position...
...I'll keep helping people.
You shoul help us as well.
- Hand over the footage. Come on.
- No way!
You disrespectful boy!
Don't you dare raise your voice!
Get out! Go!
Seoul Trip of the
North Korean Fisherman
Are they broadcasting this in the North?
You'll be questioned if you go back.
North Korea is answering
with a new footage.
Don't.
Chul Woo has been a faithful husband.
My husband would never
leave his country.
He's sincerely devoded
to his country and his family.
He won't be fooled
by the capitalist games...
He would never betray
his country or family.
Chul Woo, when you come back...
...the government promised
not to accuse you. Our daughter...
What happened Chul Woo?
Come back...
Sul is waiting for you.
Come back to your revolutionist land.
Please come back.
This is a message
to the South Korean officials.
Our people can't disregard their tears.
Let go of our fisherman brother.
Stop playing your
anti-communism games at once.
Nam Chul Woo was dragged to
the Southern border...
...because his boat broke down.
Regardless of his innocence,
he was arrested and tortured.
You are looking for
an excuse to start a war.
Your capitalist methods won't work.
Our nation is bound to conquer.
Congratulations.
We will send you back to North Korea.
I can't...
...thank you for that.
There are still many things
we don't know about you.
So wht?
The only reason you're going back
is because of your family...
...not because of dictatorship.
Isn't that so? North Korea is
testing their nuclear missiles.
The future of your country is in danger.
The result can harm the entire Korean land.
We'd like you to help us,
once you're back to your country.
Think carefully.
There are secret bases where you live.
Are you asking me to be a spy?
What we can call it is...
...that we need your help for peace.
You can be a hero.
Stop talking.
You received many presents
from Korean associations.
I don't need any of these.
All of them are for you.
Take anything you like.
It would be better if you take them.
Were you able to sleep?
I sold the gifts and got you dollars.
You can survive
for a long time with this money.
Try not to get caught.
Hide it well.
Take it.
You can give it to your daughter.
Jin Woo.
Move!
I heard you were going back to hell.
- I pity you.
- What?
- Let's get out of here.
- You owe me an apology.
Lucky you. The only reason you're free
is because we don't have evidence.
You're a twat with inferiority complex.
Peace cannot be established
because of stupid men like you!
Stop ruining everything.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, hit me.
Think you will win then?
- You're not even worth hitting.
- Get the hell out.
Calm down.
Let's go.
You're right, let's go.
He's not even human.
He's not worth it.
Wait now!
You can't live like that.
Don't you understand?
Son of a bitch.
That man is definitely a spy!
I won't let him
complete his mission!
Fake Spy Mission
at National Security
Explain this!
We didn't release such information!
Those Chinese documents were fake.
I will be questioned because of you!
What the hell was I supposed to do?
Tell me, what should I have done?
Until we protect our seas
and the Paektu Mountain
God bless our nation
The land of flowered mountains
People of Great Korea
They will always be honest
We will always be honest
Enough!
Until we protect our seas
and the Paektu Mountain
God bless our nation
Stop here.
Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
Live long!
Live long!
Live long!
Welcome Home Comrade Nam Chul Woo
Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
Live long!
Live long!
Live long!
Welcome back to your land.
Follow me.
We congratulate you
on your return.
Is my family safe?
Why? Did you do something wrong
in South Korea?
Of course, not.
Then why are you afraid?
Sul, your father's back.
Are you happy?
The soldiers took your husband
to the station.
Go downstairs.
He's here, sir.
- Wait outside.
- Yes sir.
Inspect him.
Turn.
- He's clean, sir.
- Give him clothes.
Answer my questions properly.
Yes, sir.
- Do you know how to swim?
- Yes, sir.
- How far can you swim?
- At least three kilometers.
Then why didn't you jump out
of the boat to come back?
The boat is the only thing I have.
It took me 10 years to buy it.
Is your boat more important
than your country?
- Don't you trust your country?
- I believe it, sir!
Start writing about everything
you experienced in South Korea.
Including the food you ate.
- Are you hesitating?
- No, sir.
Then write every single detail.
What happened?
No progress yet.
Try to find a mistake of South Korea.
Find something.
Yes, sir.
- Is everything true?
- Everything's true, sir.
- I closed my eyes but there...
- Just answer my questions.
There are some things wrong here.
Write again.
- What?
- Are you deaf?
I said, write again.
Don't miss any detail.
We have many unknown spies
in South Korean intelligent service.
We know exactly
what you've done there.
Then why do you need me to write it down?
What did you say?
You will do exactly
what I tell you to do!
Just a visit in the South and now
you think you're an emperor?
Start writing!
- Why did you left out your trip in Seoul?
- I was not on a trip.
- I got lost on the streets.
- Do you take us for a fool?
You were obviously
mesmerised by the Southern things.
I've never seen them before.
I see. You were surprised.
We all know that.
However, if you didn't have a family here,
you'd prefer staying there.
- Is that correct?
- No, sir!
Our great leader, Kim Jong Il!
Live long!
Live long!
- Live long!
- That's enough.
Write everything from scratch.
I wonder if you were offered to be a spy...
Yes, but I refused it.
- Seriously?
- I would never betray my country!
Then why did you...
...tell them about your military service?
- I'm sorry.
I wrote the division and names wrong
on purpose.
- Can I trust you?
- My family lives here.
I'm not a traitor!
Please believe me!
Alright.
I will believe you.
- What's this?
- They found it on the boat.
- Is that so?
- The engine was also brand new.
Really?
What's this?
A gift for my daughter, sir.
A gift?
Did you go there on a vacation?
Stand up.
Face the wall.
I'm sorry. My daughter's
doll was worn out.
Stop lying!
Why did you bring the toy?
You traitor!
Why the fuck did you bring the toy?
Why?! Answer me!
You son of a bitch!
My problem is not the toy!
The problem is your ideas!
Why the fuck did you get a new engine?
What else did you bring?
- Answer me. What else did you bring?
- I didn't bring anything else.
Stand up.
Sit.
What's this, sir?
For the evening news.
We will take his picture.
Stand up.
Now smile, proudly.
You should smile more.
The entire country will see you.
Come on, show your teeth.
- There we go. Good.
- That's how you should pose.
You should smile more.
The photographer was beautiful.
Did you see her?
Continue writing.
Why do I have to write?
Did you say something?
I got drifted there
because my engine broke.
I don't have to write it down.
I had closed my eyes,
but they fooled me, sir.
You're a traitor.
So, you don't want to write it.
Then you won't see your family.
I will write it, sir.
My family is waiting for me.
I will write it a thousand times,
if necessary.
I'm simply a fisherman.
I am not different than the others.
Are you ill?
Did they torture you?
No, sir.
I have stomach pain.
Then go to the toilet.
No.
I'm okay.
Did you starve to save our country?
It's me.
Send some food downstairs.
It's my treat.
Eat it.
- I'm not hungry.
- You don't have to be shy. Eat.
I don't want to.
Did you eat a lot in South Korea?
That's not the reason.
Then eat.
Here.
When can I go back home?
I miss my family.
If you write everything correctly,
you can go back in the morning.
Really?
Eat well.
Eat this one, too.
What happened?
Did you get nauseous?
Go to the toilet.
You don't have to hold it.
- Take him to the toiler.
- Yes, sir.
What's in your hand?
Show it to me.
Why did you
put your hand in the hole?
There was no toilet paper.
Check it.
I found it, sir.
What's this?
Don't move!
Stand up!
Forgive me!
So, you brought dollars.
You will continue to write.
Move.
Did you sleep with a South Korean girl?
No, sir.
I just helped her out.
You could've fucked her.
- Why didn't you?
- I couldn't.
Alright.
How many men
can resist a woman like her?
I understand.
They set you up and
offered you citizenship.
After all, you have ideological problems.
However, the fact that you returned
to your land is sublime.
I will let you go.
Are you serious, sir?
Yes.
You haven't seen the money.
Understood?
Keep it as a secret.
In return, I will keep...
...the things you've done there.
Understood?
Say hi to your little girl.
Welcome Home
Comrade Nam Chul Woo
Comrade, welcome home.
Did they question you?
No.
I'll bring water.
Dad!
Can you fix it?
Great Leader
Comrade.
Why are you here?
I have to cast a net.
No way.
You're forbidden from fishing.
Do other things.
You're till healthy.
I can't live without fishing.
- Wait, you can't go.
- Move!
What are you doing?
Wait!
I came back to the country!
- I want to work!
- Shut up!
You can't go into the river!
I got strict orders!
We're keep an eye on you!
No!
I will go!
- Don't move!
- Get out of my way!
Stop!
Are you disobeying my orders?
Go ahead, shoot me!
I suffered enough!
This is Post 26th. Comrade Nam
is insisting on going into the river.
Yes, sir.
I got ordered to shoot you!
Don't move!
Do whatever you want!
I have to catch fish!
That's the only way I can take care
of my family. You can't stop me!
Stop messing with me already!
We warned him enough.
Shoot, if he continues.
