 Well, try to find
 some relaxation if you can.
Yeah, actually
we always found some relax.
After the long day
of working at night,
we have some way to find fun,
especially here in New York.
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.
And thank you
for what you do.
I think the whole world
is inspired by your efforts.
- And, uh, keep fighting.
- Thank you.
Fabulous.
Okay.
Maybe a little smile?
- Possibly.
You're so serious, my friend.
 Everyone in this room can name
 real journalistic heroes,
 and yet the men and women
 of raqqa is being
 slaughtered silently
 are somehow singular.
They work in secret
and under constant threat,
reporting on the depredations
of Isis in their home city.
Some have fled in fear
for their own lives.
Even in exile,
they are in no way safe.
It's incredibly,
incredibly humbling to present
the 2015 international
press freedom award
to the brave men and women
of raqqa is being
slaughtered silently.
 Public executions
 in what was
 raqqa's paradise square.
 Anyone considered an enemy
 of Isis is killed here.
 Their bodies put on display.
By the time the emergency
services showed up,
 all they could do
 was carry out the bodies
 of fares hamadi
 and Ibrahim Abdul qader.
 Both were members
 of a group of activists
 who risk their lives
 to tell the world
 what's going on
 in their hometown of raqqa.
 Both men were beheaded.
Perfect. Okay.
Okay.
Mm.
 Isis propaganda photos
 purport to show a calm city.
 Its fighters boast
 about enjoying
 their favorite imported food,
 but these photos
 show otherwise,
 say activists inside raqqa.
 Children line up for handouts
 at an emergency soup kitchen.
 Chronic food shortages
 and hyperinflation,
 hospitals
 are empty of supplies,
the start of a terrifying cycle
 to daily life
 in the Isis stronghold.
 Videos smuggled out
 of the Isis stronghold
 and used by media outlets
 are the only way to see
 what life is like
 under extremist rule.
 Videos designed
 to embarrass Isis,
 contrary to Isis' claims
that the so-called islamic state
is prosperous and thriving.
Hello?
Hello.
 Naji jerf
 was shot in broad daylight
 on a busy street
 in Southern Turkey
 near the Syrian border.
 Jerf worked with a group
 known as raqqa is being
 slaughtered silently.
Hey, hey.
Okay.

Thank you.
One-way ticket!
Please leave this side open
to the people who are walking.
In France,
Isis has claimed responsibility
 for the fatal stabbing
 of a French police commander.
 French president
 Franï¿½ois hollande
 called the killing
 uncontestably a terrorist act.
 The last 18 months
 has seen France suffer
 three deadly attacks.
 50 killed in that shooting
 overnight
 at the pulse nightclub,
 far and away the worst
 mass shooting now
 in American history.
 Radicals who appear
 to have been inspired by Isis.
 Isis says it was behind
 a deadly attack in Berlin
 where this truck plowed
 through a holiday market,
 killing at least
 a dozen people.
 Much of what
 we know about atrocities
 committed by Isis in Syria
comes from courageous citizens
armed with smartphones.
 The dozen activists
 are pulling back the curtain
 on the horrors of Isis rule
 in their small city.
 Mohamad mousara is a former
 high-school math teacher
 who helped found
 the raqqa group.
 "I need to stay alive,"
 mohamad told us.
 "Keep getting the word out."
Thank you.
It's incredibly,
incredibly humbling to present
the 2015 international
press freedom award
to the brave men and women
of raqqa is being
slaughtered silently.
Thank you.
Members of raqqa is being
slaughtered silently
are no different
from any one of you.
 We love our home,
 and we have dreams
 of raising a family
 and living happy.
 The evil which began in Syria
 will not stop there.
 The power of good
 that is given to us by god
 should be used
 to confront the evil.
 We dedicate this award
 to our friends
 who gave their lives.
 We also dedicate this award
 to undercover heroes
 of our campaigns
and the entire people
of the city of raqqa.
Thank you.
