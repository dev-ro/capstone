( insects chirping )
My dad used to call me Klutzy-
This one time he took me
to a shooting range
and l dropped the loaded pistol
and it shot his best friend
in the butt.
And so all he could say was,
"Well, Klutzy's gone
and done it again-"
How did that make you feel?
Not so good-
Not as bad as the guy
that got shot.
Anyway, Gary picked up on it-
And after that
we'd all get together
and they would trade
Kiutzy stories.
And of course there were
a iot of them.
l don't know what it is
about me-
You know, l really-- l try
but l always mess up-
l always mess up-
( TV playing )
Don't you think, Daddy?
( changes channel )
( cell phone ringing )
Hello-
Hi Grandma-
No, she's sleeping-
( snoring softly )
Uh-huh-
Okay-
lt's out-
Good night, Grandma-
Everyone is here
because of mistakes they made---
myself included-
That really doesn't make me
feel any better-
Well, at least you know
you're not alone-
You're right- l'm sorry-
Lorraine, you're apologizing again-
So l hear that Gary has filed
for soie custody of Chad.
Yes-
( melody tinkling )
Mommy, ice cream- Mom-
Mommy, ice cream-
( tires screech )
How are you feeling about that?
Helpless-
Angry?
Guilty-
Why guilty?
Because it was
my responsibility-
Do you think it's your fault?
Well, l guess so-
l can't blame Gary-
i can't go biaming
the ice cream man-
l'm the one who let him
run out in the street
and neariy get hit
by an ice cream truck-
lt's not about blame, Lorraine-
lt's about coming to terms
with your anger.
You have a right to be angry-
( chuckles )
Who are you angry with?
Myself-
Anyone else?
lt's like--
it's like Gary said--
it was on my watch-
Gary was the one
who deserted you and Chad-
That doesn't give me an excuse
to be careless-
Lorraine, you fell asleep after a hard
day's work- That's not a crime-
Well, it is in the military-
They can shoot you for it-
ls that what you want?
Get me a gun-
l'll shoot you myself-
Okay, Betty, we've talked
about these outbursts-
lt's okay- lt's not her fault-
You have your own pain, you know-
We aii do.
You know what?
You know what your problem is?
You're too nice-
She's too nice-
That's what her problem is-
l mean, look at you-
After aii the stuff that
that jarhead did to you,
you still can't even say
a word about him.
Look, she's still wearing
the bum's ring-
Betty-
- Listen-- and he's not a jarhead-
- Yeah, he is.
No, he's not.
He's an army sergeant-
And it was my dad
who was the marine, remember?
You know what?
Gl, jarhead, daddy, husband--
what's the difference
when you're still taking orders?
l mean, correct me if l'm wrong,
but didn't Sergeant Gary
get court-martiaied?
He ought to be in jail-
You know what?
Don't be a wimp, Lorraine-
Who cares if you have
the right to be angry?
Just be angry,
for God's sakes-
- Come on, Max-
- See you next week-
- Bye, Mrs- Burton-
- Bye, Sai.
Mom, l thought you quit-
l did-
Let's go get some pizza-
You got enough money?
Sure Mom's got some money-
Okay, come on, hon-
l'm playing my game-
No, Chad, you've got to come inside
with me, aii right?
l want to beat this level-
All right,
but you stay in the car
where l can see you-
- Okay-
- All right-
Thanks, Mom-
( distant sirens wailing )
Look at 'em-
Some guy probably ran a red light
and got the whole force after him-
But where are they when you need 'em?
That's what l'm saying-
Hey, in my iine of work
they're my best friends-
Yeah, you're right.
But l bet you've got a better friend---
( taps )
under this counter here, huh?
Have a nice day-
( imitates gunshot )
A lot of creeps out there, huh?
Would you like something else?
Uh, yeah-
A pack of American Spirit blue, please-
Okay-
( register whirring )
- Thank you-
- Thank you-
Here you go, bud-
l thought we were gonna
get pizza.
lt is pizza, sweetheart-
Real pizza-
lt is real pizza-
You'll see, it's good-
- ( exhales )
- ( engine sputtering )
Oh shit-
Mommy, you said "shit-"
Don't say "shit," honey-
l didn't say it- You did-
l know, l know, l know, l know-
Okay-
We need gas again?
Yes-
l forgot gas-
How much?
Yeah, let's see-
Hold on-
$6, please-
( cell phone ringing )
Excuse me-
Hey-
l'm sorry-
Yeah, l know-
l'm sorry, Gary- Please-
Listen to me.
Why are you doing this to me?
l can't do this, okay?
i can't do this.
Chad's waiting for me, okay?
Okay-
l mean it, Gary- Stop-
Please stop-
You're the one who left me,
remember?
l'm sorry-
l'm sorry-
Are you ready for pizza?
Do we have enough for Roy?
Who's Roy?
( screams )
Oh please-
Oh my God, please don't hurt us-
Please get out of our car-
l'm not gonna hurt you-
l'm not gonna hurt your boy either-
We don't have any money-
We don't have any money-
- Beiieve me, we don't.
- l don't want your mo-- shh-
i don't want your money.
You got a car, don't you?
Just drive-
( uncocks gun )
Nice and easy-
Just drive-
( truck horn blows )
Sure you want to get
such a good look at me?
May be healthier not to-
Oh man-
Oh God, you're bleeding-
Roy: Huh?
- On your hand-
- Mm-hmm.
There's a first-aid kit
under the seat in the back-
What?
l have it in case
there's an accident or--
lt ain't my blood, lady-
Whose blood is it?
Oh, it's just general blood-
Like an army general?
You're funny.
You got a cute kid here-
My daddy is in the army-
No way-
Where's he at tonight?
He's at home-
We just stepped out
to get something to eat-
Oh yeah?
What did you guys get?
Mind if l take a look?
Check it out--
two whole mini-pizzas-
You were planning quite a feast
for the three of you, huh?
Could have invited the neighbors-
Just kidding.
You see that park
up here on the right?
Want to pull over there, please?
Okay- Oh man-
That's good-
Hey there, bud-
l'll be back in a jiffy-
lt's gonna be all right-
Lorraine:
Oh my God-
Yeah, it's Roy-
Did you make it there all right?
What?
Fuck.
God damn it-
Same shit happened to me-
There's roadblocks everywhere,
all over the goddamn place-
No, you stay there, all right?
lt'll take me six hours-
i'ii be there.
Stay there-
Yeah-
lt's okay- All right-
Hey, bud, why don't you
hop in the back seat, all right?
Lorraine: Go ahead-
Get on in there- Yeah-
There you go.
( whistles )
Nice and clean-
Now we're one big,
happy family, huh?
( starts engine )
Where are you taking us?
Weii, it's more iike
where you're taking me, huh?
You know how to find
the highway from here?
Um, l think so-
Do you know how to find the highway
from here? lt's a simple question-
Yes, l do-
Sorry, l just--
my shrink tells me l have a hard time
deaiing with ambiguity.
That means let's cut the maybes,
the l-don't-think-sos, the probablys-
You know what l mean?
- Mm-hmm.
- You understand?
l do- Actually it's really funny,
because my therapist says
that l am too ambiguous-
l am too ambiguous-
Let's just go to the highway-
Roy: Right-
Mommy-
Yeah, hon?
Are you crying again?
- Who's crying?
- Mommy's crying-
l'm not crying, honey-
i think you're right, buddy.
l think your mom is crying-
Now why are you crying?
Chad says you're crying again-
Why would he say that?
- What's your mom's name, bud?
- Lorraine-
Lorraine? Holy shit-
Mommy, Roy said "shit-"
- Don't say "shit," honey-
- Now you said it.
l'm sorry- l apologize-
Lorraine-- you know,
such a beautiful name-
i had a very speciai woman
in my life named Lorraine actually-
Really?
She had an intimate relationship
with my backside in my formative years--
yeah, her and her little
hickory stick.
Never mind there, buddy.
You wouldn't understand-
But that's my tale of woe-
We've aii got 'em, right?
Yeah-
- lt's a joke-
- What?
Lorraine, "backside, tail"--
- You get it? What's that called?
- Yeah yeah, i get it.
A pun-
- Huh?
- lt's called a pun-
- A pun, yeah-
- Yeah.
You're right.
You've got a smart mama there, boy-
l hope she's a better mom
than mine was-
Mom wasn't nice to you, huh?
l'm sorry-
Just find the freeway, okay?
Yeah, okay-
Um, there's a roadblock-
- You see that?
- Yeah- Oh yeah-
And that's for little old me-
So l'm gonna turn around, okay?
No, l want you to do
what l tell you to do-
l want you to relax
and drive the car-
So why don't we be the nice little
happy fake family that we are?
And we'll go through smiling, okay?
- ( cocks gun )
- Just reiax.
Just drive-
( police radio chatter )
Easy, Lorraine-
( police radio chatter continues )
Evening, folks-
What's going on, Officer?
We've got a couple bank robbers
on the ioose.
Don't be alarmed-
We got them bottled up-
You folks heading out of town?
Um, yes-
Where to?
We're just going a couple exits
down the highway
to that new steak joint-
You been there?
Officer:
Yeah, it's pretty good-
Look, l'm gonna need
to see your lD-
Yeah, no problem-
Lorraine: Do you have a description
of the robbers, Officer?
Maybe we've seen something-
There's not much of one-
Two white maies--
one medium-build, one heavyset-
What did they do?
Walked into a bank in broad daylight
and took a whole bunch of money-
We've only got one witness who saw
anything. it's the sheriff's deputy.
He's in the hospital right now
getting buiiets taken out.
Oh, one of them shot him?
Jesus- lt's too bad-
So is he the only one
that got shot or--?
No, we think we got
one of the bank robbers too-
l guess you used to be
in the military, huh?
( chuckles )
Can't say l blame you
for letting it grow-
Yeah-
is there anything eise
we can do for you, sir?
Yeah, there's just one thing-
You know you're breaking
the law, don't you?
Your son needs to be
in a seat belt-
Oh- Chad, what did l
teii you, buddy?
Are you gonna give us a ticket,
Officer?
- Roy: You gotta put your belt on-
- Not right now.
Little man, do me a favor- Make sure
that seat belt's buckled at all times-
Yeah, we got it-
l'm sorry, Officer-
You folks have a good night-
Thank you-
Drive-
Why did that officer think
l used to be in the military?
Did you?
Maybe he could tell-
That's a theory, Lorraine,
except l never was in the military-
Let me show you something-
This is my lD-
Not a bad shot, huh?
i want to see yours.
Oh, my-- no-
lt's such a terrible picture-
i hate it so much.
Yeah, but l want to see it-
Oh, here we go-
Come here-
What have we got here?
Aha- Hey, little man,
who's in that picture, eh?
That's me and Mommy-
- And?
- And Daddy-
And Daddy-
Not me-
- i'm sorry.
- Well, l think l'll be in charge
of the family finances
from now on,
except there's no cash-
You've got no credit cards.
What do you guys do for money?
l don't get paid till Friday,
aii right?
Weii, that seems weird.
So what do you do Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday--
all the days--?
- We get by.
- Get by on frozen mini-pizzas
is what you get by on, huh?
You couid buy a ioaf of bread
and a jar of peanut butter for Chad
- with all the money that it cost for-- - Are you
questioning
- how l feed my child?
- ( tires screech )
- Whoa, put your hands on the wheel-
- l'm sorry- Okay-
- Control the goddamn car-
- Okay-
Are you forgetting what this is?
No-
Who do you think has control
of this situation, huh?
You do-
Well, that's good
you know that.
lt's strange, 'cause a guy
with a deadly firearm in your car--
l thought l set
the ground rules for you-
But your mom-- she's a bit---
( whisties )
loopy-
She's forgetting some details-
- l was just trying to--
- Well, now you're a little fuzzy
on the detaiis, so what i want to do
is start over and lay them out for you-
As iong as i'm in this car,
there's gonna be no more crying,
lying or chit-chat-
You understand me?
Fine- You're just not
understanding what l'm sa--
Uh-uh, that sounds like chit-chat,
Lorraine-
We just covered that-
lf you take me
where l gotta go
and you don't lie,
everything's gonna be fine.
You and your boy will be safe-
This is what we call
a little grace period
and it starts now-
What have you got
in that pocket there?
What?
Now don't play innocent
with me, Lorraine.
ln your little pocket-
What?
Oh. i-- i quit.
l'm trying to quit-
- Sorry, buddy.
- lt's okay, Mom-
- Have one- lt will calm your nerves-
- No- No, thank you-
- How about you, bud?
- No.
i'm kidding.
You're not gonna be a smoker-
lt's a horrible habit-
What?
You're a beautiful woman-
You seem a little sad though-
l bet you clean up real nice-
Looks like we're running out
of gas.
So why don't we stop?
We've got a long trip ahead of us-
Well, as you have seen,
i don't have a dime.
- Yeah, no shit-
- Mommy.
Sorry- That's two strikes for Roy-
i'm sorry.
l'm rather flush at the moment,
so it shouldn't be a problem-
Let's get some gas-
Man: Hi-
Let's go to that diner over there-
- Are you hungry, bud?
- Man: Pardon me-
l'll get you whatever you want-
What do you iike?
l want chocolate milk-
Chocoiate miik, huh?
Let's go over here, Lorraine-
And pie-- he likes pie-
That's a lot of sugar, but okay-
Let's get some burgers too, huh,
with some pickles, some ketchup?
Can l still have
the chocolate milk?
Sure. i toid you,
whatever you want-
l have to go to the bathroom-
Come on, buddy-
Okay, well, Chad is gonna--
he's gonna stay with me-
We're gonna order our food,
right, bud?
Be quick, all right?
Come sit with me, bud-
Lorraine, we'll be right here,
so hurry up, okay?
Oh my God-
Shit-
You want a pork rind?
Don't hurt my mom-
- l'm not gonna hurt your mom-
- Are you listening?
i'm iistening to you.
l'm not gonna hurt you or your mom-
You've just got to do what l say
a little longer-
Hancock-- near Hancock-
Off Highway 61 -
l need some help, please-
- Woman: What city, please?
- i don't know what city.
Can you speak louder?
l can't hear you-
What?
Hold on-
- You play baseball or what?
- Tee ball-
Tee ball? What position?
You don't know?
Your dad never told you?
What's he doing-- this guy?
He's got to step it up a notch-
Me-- l played second base-
So if you want to hit
those home runs,
you've got to get ready-
You've got to wait for that pitch-
Bang!
( whistles )
A miie away.
You see that thing go?
Come on, you try-
You try-
You're a righty, huh?
All right, now you want to wait
for that pitch.
it's aii in the hips.
Look at that pitcher in the eye-
Three, two, one-
Boom! Whoa-
See, now that would have been
a home run, buddy.
Don't forget
what l taught you, okay?
Your mom's awfully slow,
isn't she?
Let's go see what's going on-
Lorraine, how is it going
in there?
- l'll be right there-
- Lorraine, turn the water off-
We've got to get moving here-
Hello- Um, is this 91 1?
Woman: This is lnformation-
Who are you caiiing?
- Wait, it's not 91 1?
- No, this is lnformation-
Hello? What?
Oh my God-
Oh my God-
Are you talking to somebody
in there?
Lorraine: Hold on-
Oh my God-
Oh my God-
All right, you've got 10 seconds
or l'm taking Chad with me-
( whispering )
Okay okay.
( knocks on door )
Roy: Hey, Lorraine,
how are we doing in there?
Oh-
Roy: Yeah, we're gonna
ieave you behind.
What the hell are you doing
in there, Lorraine?
Excuse me-
l was praying-
Mm- Good, huh?
Mm-hmm-
Sure you don't want
a burger, Lorraine?
l'm not hungry-
You don't know what
you're missing, Lorraine-
These are truck-stop burgers,
right?
None of those prefab fast-food crap,
right, bud?
You've got a good boy here,
Lorraine-
Look, how about
some French fries?
At ieast have a fry.
You've got to eat something-
Come on.
You need to eat something-
Thank you-
Yeah. Here.
lt's pretty good-
What is that?
- Huh?
- Under the bag-
Oh, show your mom-
How about that, huh?
Amazing-
You can get anything
in a truck stop these days,
even love, so l'm told-
Well, he already has one-
His dad bought it for him-
Actually you're wrong about that,
'cause l asked him- He doesn't-
l'll see you in a bit-
l'm going up front, buddy,
going up front-
Jesus, Roy-
So remember
when i toid you we had
a long drive ahead of us?
You never asked how far-
Well, l figured you'd tell me
if you wanted me to know-
You're in controi
of the situation, remember?
Good girl-
You're learning-
Basically l've got a rendezvous
with a partner of mine
about 350 miles away-
You think you can make it there
with no hiccups,
no speeding tickets?
l think so-
l mean, yes-
Definitely yes-
- You're a fast learner-
- Yeah, thanks-
Slow down, Lorraine-
What are you doing?
There's a cop behind us-
l'm sorry- l didn't mean to-
l'm nervous-
God damn it- Just take it slow
and calm down now-
( siren wailing )
( chuckies )
We got lucky-
Oh, he's pulling somebody over-
That dude is wasted-
How do people go and drive
in that condition, you know?
lt amazes me-
You're awfuiiy seif-righteous
sometimes for a bank robber-
Really?
Oh, l didn't know
that in the ground rules
l asked you to comment
on my character-
Sorry-
But l'll let it slide-
lt's funny-- it reminds me
of that shrink again-
l mean, he called me
a rigid moraiist.
How about that--
a rigid moralist?
Well, if you really want
my opinion,
l mean,
i'd say you have
sociopathic tendencies maybe,
but, um,
l don't really know
what a moralist is, to be honest-
Well, it means that l have
a very strong, strict code
for what's right and wrong-
lt means l don't deal
with compromises.
l don't accept them-
l believe what's right is right-
lt's funny, you know,
'cause all these people out there--
they think if you're a criminal,
- you don't have any morals-
- Right?
lt just isn't true-
it's garbage.
l mean, you look at all these
law-abiding people everywhere
and they don't know morals
from molasses-
And then these peopie--
they think, "Oh, l'm gonna play it safe
and l'm gonna do it this way-"
And that makes them feel righteous-
They're nothing but sheep-
l think l'm a sheep-
What?
You think l'm a sheep?
Um,
no, l think you're a whole other
class of something else-
l think things
got twisted up for you-
You don't know
which way to jump-
That's what l find-
Tell me about your old man-
What's your tale of woe?
No tale- We're divorced-
So you divorced him
and he's not getting any tail, right?
Get that?
- "Tail"-- you see what l did there?
- Yeah, a pun- l get it-
lt's funny-
( laughs )
Yeah, it's funny-
Did he ever hit you?
Once-
Well, see, there you go-
You do know right from wrong,
'cause you didn't take it-
You left-
You took your boy
and protected him and yourself-
What else is there?
l think l've taken very good care
of my boy, you know?
Now why would you care
what l think?
- l'm a criminal-
- ( laughing )
That's what l am, right?
You care what a criminal thinks
of your parenting skiiis?
- That's a little crazy-
- Yeah-
This is nice, you know?
lt's nice to just be able to have
a conversation with you.
i think the more
you get to know me,
the more we get along-
l think what it all
boiis down to
is l like talking to you-
l haven't had that in a while-
So---
when are you gonna
let us go?
l mean, you're probably gonna
let us go soon, right?
Huh-
Talk about the fickle females-
( chuckles )
l mean, here we are-
We've just-- kind ofjust had
a great conversation.
l'm opening up to you-
- l'm feeling kind of vulnerable and--
- No, that's not what i meant.
- That's not--
- Well, Lorraine, you do me right,
and l'll send you
and your boy off
with a smiie
and a fond farewell-
But you do me wrong,
and you and little Chaddy
are really fucked-
Are you threatening
my son now?
l'm threatening you
and your son.
- You got your brights on?
- No-
Well, just slow down-
i think there might be
a speed trap up ahead-
Hello- Lorraine-
Hello, crazy woman-
Lorraine-
Don't be a wimp, Lorraine-
Who cares if you have the right
to be angry?
Just be angry, for God's sakes-
Lorraine, l said slow down-
- ( Lorraine screams )
- ( grunts )
- ( tires screeching )
- Damn it-
Come on-
Come on, honey-
- Come on, come on-
- ( car horn honks )
Oh God- Help!
Help!
Lorraine!
Help!
- Come here.
- ( Lorraine screams )
- Lorraine: Chad, Chad!
- Get up.
- Roy: We're just playing tag, buddy-
- Run! Chad, run!
Get up-
What the fuck
are you trying to do?
Huh? What did we
just talk about?
- Don't hurt my boy.
- What did we just talk about?
- Don't hurt my boy-
- Mommy.
Listen to me-
l thought you maced me
back there-
ls that Binaca?
i didn't even know
they still made that-
Fucking-- i smeii iike
a fucking candy cane, Lorraine-
Thanks-
Let's get back to the car-
Come on-
Hey, Chad, you're gonna
get in the back, okay?
Mom's up front with me-
l'm gonna drive-
- Lorraine: Okay, go ahead-
- i'ii get him.
You get in- You get in-
Your mom's a real pistol, huh?
A real pistol-
Lorraine: lt's okay-
( panting )
Okay okay okay-
- Okay, let's try this again-
- Oh my God. Okay.
( tires screech )
So l've got about 250 grand
and another 350
and some change
waiting for me
at the end of this road-
Good for you-
So if l get away with this,
l've got everything to live for-
lf l get caught,
l've got nothing to lose-
l have to go to the bathroom-
Can you pull over, please?
No, we were just there.
You should have gone there, bud-
- l'm sorry-
- l have to go-
Please just pull over and l promise
l won't give you any more trouble-
You always say that-
Here, iittie buddy.
Got a cup-
l've done it before-
No. No no no.
Honey, put on your earphones-
Pay attention to your video game-
We'ii stop soon, aii right?
You can hold it-
We're not stopping, Lorraine-
l'm betting we are-
Okay, you want to bet?
Let's do it. Ante up.
- What?
- l've got 550, a little more,
saying that we're not stopping-
What have you got?
l don't want your money-
What are you gonna bet, Lorraine?
You've got to put something up.
l have nothing-
That's not necessarily true-
Okay.
Okay, how about this?
lf l win, you let us go-
And if l lose,
l won't be any more trouble-
Hmm, that's what
you said before-
You already lied once to me-
( cell phone buzzing )
And now yourjacket's buzzing-
- What the hell is that, Lorraine?
- i don't--
- Lying to me again.

- Hello-
- Give me the phone-
Hey- Gary?
Well, yeah- Hey- How are you?
This is John.
Yeah, Lorraine's here,
but she's a bit tied up right now-
l've got a question for you:
is it true you've got this
little pee-pee the size
of a baby gherkin?
'Cause Lorraine told me you did-
And unfortunateiy
l was thinking about that-
Being a divorced man and all,
and you're going out,
probably trying
to meet some ladies-
Uh-huh.
Well, that's--
that's kind of insulting,
since we've never met-
Why don't you listen to this, Gary?
This is the sound of you
being tossed out on your ass-
( chuckies )
Why did you do that?
( tires screech )
All right, bud, you can go
take a leak now if you want-
lt's okay, hon- Just stay right outside
the door, okay, so Mom can see you-
Roy: Yeah, be safe-
Just stay right close to the car, okay?
Me and your mom are right here-
Good boy-
Yeah, just right there-
Listen to me.
l want some answers
and l want some fucking answers
right now.
You had a phone in that bathroom-
You were at the gas station-
Did you make a call?
- Did you make a phone call?
- Yes- Yes, l did-
Who did you call? Gary?
That fucking prick?
- No.
- Who? You call 91 1 , the police?
No-
So who'd you caii, Lorraine?
l'm not fucking around anymore-
l tried to call 91 1 ,
- but l didn't- lnstead--
- Don't lie to me-
i am not iying, i swear.
l promise you that l called 41 1 -
And the operator-- she asked me
what city l was in
and i didn't understand
what she was asking me
and l got confused-
l tried to call 91 1 -
lt didn't work-
So you're telling me
you called 41 1
- instead of 91 1 -
- Yep-
And then you're telling me
that you forgot to turn your phone off-
- Yep-
- Well, you're a fucking train wreck-
Maybe you don't want me
to iet you go.
- You must really like me-
- Chad: i'm done.
Hey, bud, come on back in-
Lorraine: Come on, hon-
Come back in- Come on-
You feel better?
- Lorraine: That's my boy.
- All right, let's keep going here-
Okay, baby, why don't you
lie down and get some rest?
Okay, Mommy-
Are you into politics, Lorraine?
Like which way do you vote?
l don't know-
l voted the way
Gary wanted me to-
Weii, that's siiiy.
You don't have your own opinions?
i wouidn't iet you do that.
l'd want you to do what you want to do-
You know what?
You're right-
l need to be more in control-
l'm gonna make some changes
when l get home, l'm telling you-
Roy: Well, if everything
goes to pian for me,
l'd like to make
some changes too-
Lorraine:
You should, you know-
Settie down.
Find someone to settle down with-
Get yourself a nice wife
and a boy of your own-
ls that an invitation?
l'd love to have my own family-
l'd love to have a little boy
iike Chaddy back there.
Yeah, l want three girls too-
Man, if l had
three little daughters,
i wouid protect them so much,
they'd never have a worry in the world-
i'd raise my boy
to be real strong
so after l'm gone
he'd look after them-
You ever been to Mexico?
Tijuana once-
That's a shithole-
No, l'm talking the real Mexico,
up in the mountains-- pueblos-
l mean, it's cool- lt's dry-
The air is crisp-
l always wanted to go
to a puebio.
You know, in fourth grade you build
those sort of ciay modeis.
And l used to pretend l was one of
the guys in there and i iived there.
And the people are so great
in the puebios.
i mean, it's the opposite of
what we were talking about earlier-
And taik about iiving--
l mean, a man with a little money--
we'd own that town.
l mean, we'd have a big house,
hunt and fish
and drink tequila every day-
Come wintertime, we could also
drive down to Cabo San Lucas
and get a big villa on the beach,
even have servants-
Wouldn't that be something?
Yeah-
And you don't have to worry
about the ianguage,
'cause most people
speak Engiish.
Oh really?
i actuaiiy aiways wanted
to learn how to speak Spanish-
l always wanted to travel too,
but then, l don't know,
l guess l got married too young-
l was even gonna go to college,
but my dad said
l was too dumb and too pretty-
Are you really going to Mexico?
You're not getting it-
We're going to Mexico-
l--
We're going to Mexico,
Lorraine-
l can't-
Roy, this is crazy.
l can't go to Mexico-
l can't take Chad there-
l mean, we have a whole life here
and he's just--
Right, yeah, a big life--
you, Chad and all those
frozen mini-pizzas-
l'm trying to give you
a way out, Lorraine-
( quiet thud )
What's going on with the car,
Lorraine?
- Lorraine: Oh God-
- Hoid on.
- Oh God, oh God, oh God-
- Let me pull over- Hold up-
We've got to stop for gas-
- We have half a tank-
- No. i know.
There's water in the tank-
l mean, it's run out,
but when it goes--
the gauge goes down to half,
it means--
it starts to sputter and then
we have to stop for more gas-
lt's a pain in the ass, l know-
So why didn't you
just get it fixed, Lorraine?
You're pathetic-
Okay-
( clears throat )
What the hell are there so many kids
out here for, Lorraine?
lt's nighttime-
Lorraine:
Maybe it's a field trip-
Stay in the car-
( exhales )
Hey, bud, come here-
- lt's time to go to the bathroom, okay?
- l already went-
l know, but you're
gonna go again-
Now you listen to Mommy and promise
you're gonna do what i say.
- Okay, Mommy-
- Okay.
Get in the car, Lorraine-
Chad has to go to the bathroom-
Hey, buddy, come on out-
You gotta go to the bathroom
again, huh?
You got some bladder on you-
You go straight there
and you come right back, okay?
Mm-hmm-
Your mom's gonna wait here-
Go for it-
Why don't you get in the car,
Lorraine?
Do you want my balloon?
Come on, man, don't talk to her-
Just go to the men's room.
You can have it-
You don't need that baiioon.
We've got to get moving soon-
There you go-
( spits )
Motherfucker-
( car door opens )
( tires screech )
( sobbing )
l know you're mad-
l'm-- l'm sorry, Roy-
Look, i promise
it's not what you think-
Okay? Gary doesn't
give a crap about me, you know,
but he really cares about Chad-
lf he was with us, he'd have
every cop in the country after us-
Fuck you, Lorraine!
l'm sick of your goddamn lies!
l'm not lying-
i didn't do it.
- You know what? Fuck you-
- l am not lying-
You've been fucking with me
from the beginning.

On the matter of
the custody of Chad,
l find that Mr- Burton has not shown
any convincing evidence
as to the chiid negiect
on the part of Mrs- Burton-
- Therefore she will retain custody-
- But Your Honor, you don't--
And frankly, Mr- Burton,
considering your recent legal troubles,
i am amazed
that you had the chutzpah
to even bring these charges-
But l must commend you
on getting a good job
so soon after your
court martial-
And you can share your good fortune
by paying Mrs. Burton
$400 a month in child support-
$400? She just got
a $20,000 reward
for that bank robber
she supposedly caught-
She ought to be paying me-
l can make it $500 if you like-
ls there anything
you'd like to add, Mrs- Burton?
Yes- Thank you, Your Honor-
l'll be going by my maiden name now--
Miss Serrano-
Judge: Right you are,
Miss Serrano.
Good luck to you-
Court is adjourned-
Mommy!
Hi, buddy- Hi-
Love you so much-
- Grandma: Oh, be careful-
- Who's ready for some pizza?
Hey, Mom-
Can it be real pizza?
Oh, i think you can have
all the real pizza you want-
Why do you say that?
l dropped one of my
earrings down
near the end of your bed
this morning.
lt would have rolled
right underneath
if that big duffle bag
hadn't been there-
( both chuckle )
What about ice cream?
You want ice cream
instead of pizza?
No, ice cream and pizza-
- How about ice cream pizza?
- And root beer.
( all laugh )
( instrumental music playing )
