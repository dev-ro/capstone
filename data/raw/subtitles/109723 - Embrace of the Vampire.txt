I was in love once
when I was a man.
That time is now
a mist in my mind.
She was a maid to royalty,
and I was a nobleman.
At the end of the day...
we would meet
in our secret piece.
My love...
my virgin.
The sadness I felt
each time she left.
If only I had known
that day would be our last.
The pain of loneliness
without her.
And now...
after centuries...
having drank blood enough
to fill a thousand lakes...
in this piece,
this small college...
I have found her soul again.
I have found her.
But my time in this world
is coming to an end.
In three days, I will fall
into eternal sleep.
Only her soul can save me.
My virgin...
my elixir.
But she loves another.
I will put doubt
in their minds...
then I will take her
when her heart is not his.
Eternal life will be her prize.
Three days.
I can't be weak.
I choose survival.
I'll destroy anyone
who stands in my way...
even my own heart if need be.
She's mine!
Charlotte...
come to me.
I'm waiting for you, Charlotte.
I'm waiting.
Come to me.
Hi. This is Charlotte.
I'm either in a lecture
or studying...
so leave a message,
and I'll call back.
Charlotte, it's Chris.
Are you there?
Pick up, Charlotte.
Charlotte, it's me.
Come to me.
I'm going to come by.
I'm worried about you, ok?
Come to me.
Charlotte, I'm coming over.
Come to me.
I'm waiting for you, Charlotte.
Come to me, Charlotte.
I'm here.
But I can't just reach out
and take her.
She must desire me...
before I empty her life
into my throat...
and take back the love I lost
so long ago.
I feel it in your heart.
Love...
that so-called gift to mankind.
My bite would free you.
I could destroy him...
but that would break your heart.
Love is a bond
between two halves.
I'll give you time...
time to see how fragile
that bond is.
As much time as I have.
Three days.
Chris?
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Are you ok?
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
I picked you up off the stairs
last night outside.
Outside?
You don't remember?
I thought I was dreaming.
Well, I wasn't.
What were you doing there?
Well, I know it sounds
kind of stupid...
but I thought you were in
some kind of danger last night.
I did.
I was worried, that's all.
I was just worried about you.
It's my job.
I guess it's going to take
more than I thought...
to get used to this piece.
Yeah.
It was nice to
wake up beside you.
Chris, don't.
I'm sorry.
-Please don't be mad.
-I'm not mad.
That's not true.
I am mad at your mom...
for letting those nuns
bring you up like one.
Let's not start
on that again, ok?
You turn around?
She didn't have a choice.
Let's put the knives in your
father's back where they belong.
Yeah, that might be
more appropriate.
I can't help wishing
you had inherited...
a little bit of his promiscuity.
But look where it got him.
I wish I'd seen him at least
once before he died.
He was alone, and I don't want
that to happen to me.
It won't.
You're going to be surrounded
by our kids and grandkids.
Can we not talk
about dying, please?
Sure.
I'd prefer birth-related
subjects anyhow.
You can turn around now.
Tell me something.
Why can't two people
who care about each other...
and love each other
so much express it?
We express it
all the time, Chris.
Help me with my cross.
You know what I mean.
I never actually said
that I intended to wait...
until I was married, you know.
You didn't?
No.
I said that
I would make love...
to the right man
when he came along...
and I was old enough to know.
And I'm not the right man?
I think you are.
You think I am?
We've been together a year
and about two months...
and you think I am?
I think age
has a lot to do with it.
Hey, Chris.
What are you doing here?
Never mind. Stupid question.
Are we still
going to the bookstore?
Yeah. I'm just going
to walk Chris to his car.
I'll meet you downstairs
in five minutes.
You're looking good!
As we were saying...
What were we saying again?
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
We were talking about
coming of age...
and when you'll be able
to make love to me.
In many parts of the world,
18 is considered coming of age.
In three days, you're having
your eighteenth birthday.
I know!
-Bye.
-Bye.
You think you are in love...
that you are fortunate.
You think
love is a cherished gift.
You're wrong.
It's a blight and a curse.
It divides and weakens
your power.
You forgot my gift.
It's a beautiful name.
-Spend eternity with me.
-No.
You're strong.
Feel...
Each hour that passes
weakens me more.
Two days left.
You know Charlotte,
right, Eliza?
Sure.
Where are you headed?
My room.
I have some studying.
-Yo, Eliza.
-Yo yourself, Rob.
-Am I going to see you tonight?
-Are you?
Come on, Eliza.
If I'm in the mood.
I'll get you in the mood.
Are you going to slip
something into my drink?
If I have to.
Nothing else will work,
believe me.
-You're such an asshole.
-You love it.
See you tonight, then?
I love those eyes.
Don't you love those eyes?
Is that your boyfriend?
I don't know if
I'd call him my boyfriend...
but he serves his purpose.
Tell her about
the answering machine.
You're going to die.
Tell her.
Never mind. I'll tell her.
The first night
Eliza and Robby hook up...
they get smashed at McGee's
and go back to the dorm.
I was in complete control.
Anyway, Eliza hits
her answering machine...
thinking she's got
all these messages...
only she hits
the wrong button...
and instead of
pressing the play button...
she was recording a new message.
Stupid machine.
Well, anyway, maybe Eliza
hit the wrong button...
but Rob was hitting
all the right ones...
and Eliza is a screamer.
'"Do me! Fuck me, stud!
Fuck me harder!""
And the whole thing
is being recorded...
so the next day,
anybody who called...
got that sex tape as a greeting.
My mother said
she nearly had a heart attack.
She's so melodramatic.
It's not like
she doesn't know I have sex.
She buys the pills,
for Christ's sake.
Isn't that hysterical?
Yeah.
Why look so shocked?
I heard you were raised
in a convent, right?
Everyone knows Catholic school
girls give the best head.
-Eliza.
-What?
I've seen your boyfriend...
and don't tell me he gets off
by just looking at you.
That's enough, Eliza.
Could you just relax?
Charlotte lives her life...
you live your life,
I live my life...
and nobody makes
any judgments, ok?
Who's judging?
Wait up, Charlotte.
Sorry about Eliza.
She does have
a good side, I think.
You didn't let her
get to you, did you?
-Are you ok?
-Yeah.
It's just my mind
keeps wandering.
I keep daydreaming about
these really stupid things.
Does that ever happen to you?
Me? No, I don't daydream...
except about sex and
beautiful men and sex...
I just can't seem
to stay focused.
Maybe something
is distracting you.
-Everything ok with Chris?
-Yeah.
You're probably having trouble
adjusting to the freedom.
I wasn't brought up in jail.
The nuns were pretty cool...
and I got to spend one weekend
a month with my mother.
You were lucky.
I had to spend every day
with my parents.
You just need to relax,
have a little fun.
You remember fun, don't you?
Hey, girls,
would you look at that?
-Sarah's at it again.
-And in broad daylight.
Nice pecs.
Oh, my God. He's gorgeous.
Where does she find them?
What nerve.
What a slut.
That's not very nice.
-So what?
-She might hear you.
Who cares?
She has a different model
in there every night.
But still, it's...
This is cute.
The campus virgin
defending the campus nympho?
Why can't you cut her
some slack?
-Give me a break.
-No. Give her a break.
This is new to her, and she's
having a rough time adjusting.
If she can't take it,
that's not my problem.
She needs to get laid.
Knock, knock. What is it?
I can't find my cross.
The one Chris gave you?
I have no idea where it is.
Did you have it on
when you left?
I don't know.
I don't think I did.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Let's just look.
I wore this yesterday.
Maybe it's in here.
-What's this?
-I don't know.
You don't know?
I've never seen it before.
Well, how did it get
in your room?
I don't know.
But I've dreamt about this.
You dreamt about it.
You've never seen it before,
but you've dreamt about it.
I know it sounds weird.
What kind of dream?
It was...
What?
A man was wearing it.
-Not Chris?
-No.
Who?
You'll laugh.
No, I won't. You know me.
I have weird dreams
all the time.
I think he was a vampire.
A vampire?
Cool.
And you had sex with him?
No, but I think he wanted to.
Maybe someone's trying
to tell you something.
Maybe you should look around...
play the field,
check out some other guys.
Please, Nicole.
You think Chris
doesn't look at other girls?
He does not.
All guys do.
They can't help it.
It's a chemical, hormonal,
asshole kind of thing.
I almost forgot the party.
Hey! Do you hear me?
I think you need
some loosening up.
Come on.
I need an "A" in art history.
I have to study.
You need to go to this party...
and we'll look
for your cross later.
Do we really have to go?
Remember what I was saying? Fun.
It's going to do you some good.
For me, please?
I want to get there before
all the cute guys are taken.
Let's go
-Do I look ok?
-You look amazing.
Will you come on?
This is going to be great.
-What's wrong?
-I should be studying.
You need to lighten up.
Come on.
Nobody's going to bite you.
-Hi, guys.
-Come here.
You go get a drink.
I'll see what I can dig up.
Be good.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Enjoying yourself?
I just got here...
but it seems like
a pretty cool party.
It sucks.
But hey, what else is going on?
You want something to drink?
Actually, I would love a soda.
Carbonation. Cool.
It's ok. Have fun.
Thank you.
My name's Milo.
Hi. I'm Charlotte.
I like that.
Nice ankh.
Excuse me?
Around your neck.
It's an ankh.
It's an ancient Egyptian symbol
for eternal life.
They believed it had...
sexual powers.
I figured
you were being retro...
you know, Sixties coming back
and all that.
No, no.
-You wear it well.
-Thank you.
There you are, Milo.
You're not spending
near enough time with me.
You're supposed to protect me
from that horny toad Rob.
Eliza...
you know Charlotte?
Hello, Charlotte.
Nice to see you.
We were just talking
about ankhs.
My favorite subject.
You got any smokes?
I'm absolutely dying.
Which kind?
That's a silly question,
isn't it?
Oh, yes. Follow me.
Want to come?
I doubt it.
No. I'll catch you later.
That's cool.
I love the view from here.
It reminds me of a piece
far away.
Do I know you?
We might have met once...
a long time ago, perhaps.
What are you doing here?
Waiting.
I've seen you before...
in a dream.
It wasn't a dream.
Why are you haunting me?
Who are you?
I'm your destiny.
It's my gift.
You've cut yourself.
Someone just told me
that it has powers.
It does.
That's its power.
What are you
doing out here alone?
-Where did he go?
-Who?
-He was just here.
-Who?
I don't know.
Did I interrupt something?
He was just here--
the man from my dream.
Great, but there's someone
I want you to meet.
I think you've had
a bit too much fresh air.
Relax. These guys are cool.
We're just going
to go to the old gym...
for a little bit of privacy.
This is not a big deal...
and nothing is going to happen
you don't want to, ok?
See you.
Do you bring
all your dates here?
Only the cute ones.
Well...
Let's see here.
Hey, how you doing?
Who are you?
Jonathan,
and you must be Charlotte.
What do you want?
Don't worry about it.
You'll get it.
Get off.
Get off me!
What's your problem?
Leave her alone.
Bitch.
Charlotte is pure.
I need her to stay that way.
Over here, Chris.
Hello.
You're there?
Where else would I be?
I just wanted
to hear your voice.
I almost called you before
for the same reason.
Why didn't you?
I guess I thought
you were sleeping.
I guess I'm
Less considerate than you.
I'm glad you called.
Me, too.
Are you ok?
Good night and...
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Can't wait.
How you doing?
Just a coffee.
You think what you need
to learn in life...
you can get from books?
That's what my dad says.
I don't mean to be rude,
but I came here to study.
I couldn't sleep either.
Usually, I like to write
at this time...
but I wasn't in the mood.
You're a good-looking guy.
Look, I'm not gay or anything.
I just came down here
to study...alone.
Got it?
Come on. I can tell.
You're in love. She's beautiful.
Am I right?
Yeah, you're right.
I think trust is such
an essential part of love.
What do you think?
Do you trust her
when you're not with her?
I mean, completely trust her?
You don't have to say.
I know it's hard.
It's hard to love
when there is doubt.
It was nice talking to you,
but I got to go.
Don't you always
want to know where she is?
What she's doing...
who she's talking to?
Is that love, or is that doubt?
It's love.
Love...
I always have the same dream.
I see her riding to meet me.
I am waiting,
but she never gets there.
If I hadn't loved her, that pain
would not have followed me...
into this death I now live in.
If only I had doubted her...
I could have found
a reason to heal my loss.
Doubt is the key, Charlotte.
Doubt will help you come to me.
This is my gift to you.
I'm not going to wait
forever, Charlotte.
My love...
one more day.
Sorry. I hope you don't mind.
No. It's all right.
You look really sad today,
sort of waiflike.
I like it. It's interesting.
You're Sarah, right?
I'm Charlotte.
I know. May I sit down?
Sure. Go ahead.
Do you always study this early?
I wish I could call it studying.
-First year, right?
-Yeah.
It's always the hardest.
I hope so.
So...is this a major
or a hobby?
This is a major hobby.
I didn't get much sleep
last night.
Maybe you should
put the books away...
and stop staring
at the tower.
You want to come see my work?
That's great.
Let me just put this away.
I like your outfit.
It's kind of cool,
but I like what you're wearing.
This is just a shirt.
I spend my money on my material.
Are these all yours?
Are they all your friends?
Some of them.
They all look so beautiful.
They are.
You're beautiful.
Me?
No, not like them.
They all look so perfect.
Well, they're not innocent...
and they're certainly
not virginal.
Am I that transparent?
Want a cigarette?
They're cloves.
You'll like them.
The flavor's really nice.
Like it?
ok, I guess.
Here, take them.
No, it's ok.
You're sure?
ok.
Do you like that picture?
It's nice there.
Stand a bit back.
Is this where
they usually stand?
Sometimes.
Only if they want to.
You mind if I take
some pictures of you?
-Go ahead.
-You're not shy?
Close your mouth.
Sit down. Let me take
some pictures there.
Cute teddy bears.
That's nice.
Would you mind
unbuttoning your overalls...
and taking them down a bit?
Do you mind?
That's better.
You've got beautiful skin.
Your hair's so soft.
Would you like to lay back?
Could you lean back more?
-Do you feel comfortable?
-I'm ok.
Beautiful. My God.
Yeah. That's good.
It's hot.
Good.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I got to go.
-Don't you ever knock?
-What for?
You never have anything
going on in here.
That's changing tonight.
Cool.
Who's the lucky girl tonight?
Why are you always
cleaning up in here...
just before
Charlotte comes over?
Because she likes it that way.
Chris, you're so whipped.
I'm not whipped. Get up.
You're going
to die of blue balls, man.
Chris, it's me.
Hey. Where are you?
Don't be mad.
I really need
to stay here tonight.
I thought we had this plan.
I know,
but I really need to study.
Charlotte,
it's your birthday tomorrow.
I'll be over tomorrow.
I promise.
Well, I just...
I wanted to be the first one...
to wish you happy birthday
and wake up next to you.
We planned that.
Is it this sex thing?
Am I pushing it too hard?
Because it doesn't matter.
I'm joking most of the time.
I want to be with you
wherever or whenever.
It's not that, Chris.
Look. I'll come over right now.
I'll sleep on your floor.
I won't touch you.
I really need to study
alone tonight, Chris.
I'll call you when I'm done.
I thought we were
a straight-A student.
I was until I came here.
Have you seen Nicole?
Nicole?
I thought we made a new friend.
And what is that
supposed to mean?
Nothing. I saw you come out
of Sarah's room...
wearing nothing
but fingerprints.
You should really just mind
your own damn business.
Don't get prissy with me, missy.
This is a painting
of Venus and Mars.
Botticelli has captured
the moment...
just after these two
mythological deities...
have consummated
their divine relationship.
In other words,
they've just had sex.
The two lovers are surrounded
by young horned satyrs--
the male counterparts
to the nymphs.
These satyrs carry a rod
which points...
So you decided to stay
this weekend?
Please leave me alone.
I can't.
I've tried.
The need in me to survive
is too strong.
I need you.
What do you want from me?
I want to stay in this world.
I don't want to go to sleep.
Leave me alone.
Botticelli clearly showed
the influence...
of the Neoplatonic cult.
Neoplatonists believed
that the soul...
could ascend toward a union
with the divine...
through the contemplation
of earthly beauty...
Would he die for you?
Would he die for you?
Go away!
Is there a problem back there,
Miss Wells?
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
"La Primavera" is also known
as "The Rites of Spring..."
Is he worth your love?
Would you die for him?
Midnight ends my final hour.
There will be no emotion
in my heart...
no weakness.
You will want me.
I will take you!
Be sure of that!
Stop!
-Have you seen Nicole?
-No.
I'm really sorry
about this morning.
It's ok.
Let me see the pictures
when they're done.
Yeah? ok.
Bye.
It's me.
I was dreaming.
You look like you saw a ghost.
What are you doing here?
Well, I had to see you...
so I knocked,
but nobody answered.
I just thought I'd wait
in here for you.
You look sick, honey.
Are you ok?
I'm fine.
What's going on between us?
Charlotte,
where's the cross I gave you?
I took it off.
I didn't take it off.
I lost it.
Why didn't you just say that?
I don't know.
You don't have
any reason to lie to me.
I don't lie.
Maybe you're the one
who lies to me.
What's that mean?
Nothing.
I don't know what I'm saying.
You have never
talked to me like this.
Why aren't you
communicating with me?
I want to communicate.
I just don't
understand it myself.
Well, is there something else?
Is there someone else
that you can't...
Now you're being ridiculous.
Am I?
How come you're never
in your room when I call?
Don't tell me
you're studying somewhere...
because your grades
would be higher.
There's no one else.
Then it's just me?
I want you to leave.
This is not what love's about,
Charlotte.
It's not my understanding
of it, anyway.
Why don't you call me?
If you want to.
I shouldn't have left her, man.
She wouldn't talk to me, though.
She was not
communicating with me.
-She's never been like that.
-You're right.
The thing is that
I love her so deeply.
I really love this girl
way too much.
Know what?
You're not helping me, Mark.
You're right.
I'm going to go call her.
You should spend five minutes
not thinking about her.
You're right.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Perhaps we met in another life.
One of those, huh?
I don't know.
Buy me a drink.
Well, sure.
What do you want?
Bloody Mary.
My name's Marika. Hi.
-I'm Chris.
-Pleasure.
-Are you from around here?
-No.
Where are you from?
I'm from everywhere.
Well, I've never been
to everywhere...
so I don't think
we could have met there.
You smell good.
You want to dance?
I'm not a really good dancer.
Come on. Dance with me.
Come on. I'll teach you.
Is he worth your love?
Sweet innocence.
You will want me.
I'm your destiny.
You're mine.
Wow.
You're looking mighty fine.
Mighty fine.
You think so?
Absolutely. You thirsty?
You pouring?
Charlotte,
I just love that dress.
You don't know
how happy that makes me.
Want some wine?
Sure.
It's not blessed. That ok?
Not bad.
Want some more?
Thank you.
-Aren't you going to share?
-No.
Why not?
I slipped an ""X"" in her drink.
Eliza,
that's really irresponsible.
Aren't you tired of all of this?
Let me take you away from here.
I need you.
Save me.
What's a good-looking man
like you doing without a date?
That's funny you should ask.
You like me, Chris?
Sure.
Do you want to get
to know me better?
Are you drunk, Chris?
Just a little.
A little?
I think I know what you need.
You do, huh?
Yes, I do.
Well, what would that be?
Follow me and find out.
Come on.
Come on, Chris.
Did that hurt?
A little bit.
Why don't you kiss it
and make it feel better?
Forget her, Chris.
Forget her.
Forget her.
Doubt her, and there will be
no pain when she's gone.
Doubt will remove
all pain, Chris.
Doubt her.
I can't.
I'm sorry. I can't.
Stop.
No, darling.
I came by to see if you were ok.
You don't look so good.
To tell you the truth,
I've never felt better.
Well, you seem different.
How?
Before, you seemed like
a little girl...
and now you're acting
like a wild woman.
Why do you think that is?
Maybe it's the stars.
See?
Did you know
Venus, the planet of love...
is reflecting the sun
ten times more than the moon?
Is it?
Really?
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Have you come to see
if I'm ok, too, Milo?
Well, yeah.
You were taking a pretty
heavy trip back there.
What do you want to do
to make me feel better?
Me?
Well...
I don't know.
Come on, Milo.
What's on your mind?
Honesty will get you everywhere.
I can think of one thing.
Well, well.
Didn't we soon change
into a little whore?
You didn't fool me.
You can have him.
I don't want him.
Get out of here, Milo,
and take that bitch with you.
Who are you calling a bitch?
I'm out of here.
Is that the best you can do?
I haven't even started.
You're nothing
but a prissy little bitch.
Sorry.
Open the fucking door,
you fucking cunt!
Open it!
I'm going to kill you,
you fucking bitch!
Open it!
Time is running out.
You are alone now, Charlotte.
There's nothing
left for you here.
Come to me.
Be with me.
Leave.
All you will find is death here.
Will you die for her?
She does not know you.
You can't take her from me.
Leave us alone!
Don't think of him.
Think of us.
Hear me, Charlotte.
Want us.
Us.
You can't take his love
to eternity with you.
Believe me. You can't.
Once more, I let you go.
Where is he?
Are you ok?
Do you know what today is?
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
