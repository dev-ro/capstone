Lou-Lou!
Lou-Lou!
Lou-Lou!
- There you are.
- Hey, Daisy.
Looks like you've
got your hands full.
Yep!
- Hurray.
- Nice.
What's up, Daisy?
Was wondering if,
um, maybe you wanted
to meet up later?
Go to Winkie's.
Oh!
I gotta help Beth
with some stuff...
I got to help
her. It's boring.
Aw! Poor Lou-Lou.
Always looking out for her, sis.
You know, you gotta
remember your own needs too.
I have some stuff to finish
up here too though, so...
You've got time.
Hey, you should have
one on me tonight.
Oh, you don't... You
don't have to do that.
Why not? It's fine.
Have fun. Rain check.
But
Hey, buddy.
When you smoke a cigarette,
you inhale a drug
called nicotine.
You could replace the
word drug with poison.
Like anything that is not
built on solid foundations,
the brainwashing is as fragile
as a house of cards...
And will collapse
in an instant.
All you have to do
is give it a shake.
Yeah, you like that dick?
Oh!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, that was...
that was magical.
Ah, fuck, yeah.
So... So should I call you, or?
What?
- About the job?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Swing by tomorrow.
Hey, careful where
you sleep around here.
It's dangerous.
Okay.
Ah!
I'd describe the withdrawal
from nicotine as a mild, empty,
slightly insecure feeling.
I've also stated
that the only reason
a smoker lights up is
to relieve that feeling.
All smokers are caught up...
In the same trap.
- Good morning.
- Hey.
Okay.
We're running a little late.
Nothing to worry about.
You'll never catch me!
Running too fast!
Whoa! You okay, bud?
Slow down.
- I lost a tooth, Lou.
- What?
Shucks, man. You
gotta be more careful.
Hey, Billy. Quit
hanging off her.
Come on, you guys.
Let's get all our
stuff together.
Aunt Lou's gonna
drive you to school.
Mom! He's calling me...
Can you open this?
Boys, come get your things.
- Mom!
- Come on, ready?
Okay.
- How's my makeup?
- Mom, he is cheating.
- Ready, set, go!
- I'm not.
You cheated last time.
Hey, Bethy Boopski?
- You girls goin' to the store?
- Why? You want something?
Can you grab me some smokes.
I'm just... I don't
wanna be late.
I don't think I'll have time.
Yeah, I could... I can come...
- Yeah?
- Drop it off.
- There you go.
- Aren't we late? No!
Late for school?
Something like that?
Dad! Dad!
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.
- Later, my dudes.
- Bye, Dad.
Bye!
Mom! KID 1: Mom!
I don't know where my bag is.
Where is it?
Since Die Hard came out,
fucking everyone wants
to try the Beretta.
We're, uh, we're setting up
a new indoor range out there.
How's it going, guys?
Uh, we got the beginners'
range out there...
We also got long distance,
moving target, novelty...
Get... Get a lot of tourists
come out for the day.
Fuckin' crazy-ass
foreigners mostly.
Uh, that's the canteen.
Sandwiches, drinks. Get a
little wild if you want.
All right, we're
gonna head this way.
Should I be nervous
or something?
No, just... Just
don't make me look
- like an asshole.
- Okay.
You know, just
stand up straight.
I'll do my best.
Oh, watch out for that.
Yeah.
Boss, now a good time?
Good as any.
Wow. Cool. What is that?
One of my Hercules larvae.
Just giving his bed
a little spruce.
They like things moist and cozy.
Fuck, yeah. They do.
Yeah.
Oh, uh. This here is Jackie.
- Uh, this is Mr. Langston.
- Hi.
She needs a job. Says
she'll do anything.
I figured we could
use some spare hands.
Yeah, you like guns?
Not really.
What the fuck are
you doing here then?
Anyone can feel strong
hiding behind a piece of metal.
I prefer to know
my own strength.
Is that right?
Excuse me, the end
toilet is blocked.
It's overflowing.
Excuse me?
- The end toilet is blocked.
- Then use the other one.

There you go.
You're Lou Langston's daughter.
- So?
- He's an old friend of mine.
How is your old man?
My old man?
He's a piece of
shit. We don't talk.
Pretty sure his
friends know that.
And your mom, do you know
where I could find her?
- Why?
- Just to talk.
Well, I'll tell you what.
When you're feeling more
friendly, give us a call.
You're nice. Can we talk?
- I'm Jackie.
- Jackie.
Closing.
Whoa! We're still in here.
We're closed, fuck off.
Jackie.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Can I steal one?
Yeah.
Is this your place?
No, I just work here.
Okay.
You were looking
pretty good in there.
Yeah?
You got some pretty
serious lines going.
Jackie!
There you are.
Ladies.
If that's all right
with you, Lou?
Hey, we're gonna go
grab a drink right now
- if you wanna come with us?
- Thanks. I'm good here.
Babe.
You know, Lou here is
a grade A dyke, right?
Is that so?
Funny, come on.
Touch me.
Whoa! Ay!
- Whoa, man. She's a girl.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I'm sorry about that.
- You crazy bitch.
Yeah, here we... Come on, now.
I was being nice.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck him! Let's go.
You cooling off out here?
You wanna ice yourself?
You gotta be careful around
here, I'm telling you.
That could've
gotten a lot worse.
I could take him.
Oh... Sorry.
So where did you appear from?
- Oklahoma.
- Really?
Yeah, I've been hitchhiking
for a while now.
Are you heading
anywhere particular?
So there's finals for
this bodybuilding contest
next month in Vegas.
Um... Gonna give it a shot.
I'm just laying low
here while I train.
Cool.
Um, most times when
people hear that,
I get this look like...
Yeah, I think I
know that look.
Is that why you left home?
Oklahomans not
into muscle chicks?
Yeah, not so much.
The place I'm from,
everyone's a farmer,
goes to church twice a
week, that kind of thing.
So how does an
Oklahoma farm girl
get into bodybuilding.
Uh, my folks adopted
me when I was 13.
And I was a fat kid.
So, kind of got bullied a lot.
- Shit.
- No, it's good.
Taught me to fight back.
Mmm.
So you're gonna win
this competition.
- And then what?
- I don't know.
I didn't think
that far ahead yet.
Yeah, I think I know that one.
You want me to
show you something?
- Okay.
- You have to stay here.
I'll be back.
So maybe this is dumb.
I don't know, I mean...
You're probably
all set with these.
But, ta-da!
Are these yours?
Yeah. How am I doing?
Hmm?
Thanks, but I... I
can't afford them.
I mean, they're free.
The guys here order 'em in bulk
from, like, Germany or Romania.
They're fucking everywhere.
I'll just give them to you.
Do you not do this shit?
Uh...
Au naturelle, baby.
All right. Your
body, your choice.
You wanna do a little bit?
I think 150 is, kind of,
the smallest dose you can do
and if you have four weeks,
you'll barely notice it,
but it'll build up gradually
and just give you
that little... edge.
Where do you want it?
In the butt.
Then turn around.
Fuck.
- Okay.
- Okay, incoming.
Mmm.
Done.
How does it feel?
Feel it already? You're,
like, boom, boom!
It's all over it immediately.
Like Popeye eating spinach.
So stupid.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You're not, like, some
fucking straight girl, right?
Just trying shit out?
Ow!
Oh, shit, sorry.
Holy, shit!
Holy, fuck.
Hey!
Hey.
So I gotta... I gotta
go to work today,
but do you, maybe,
wanna hang out later?
You got a job already?
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm waitressing
at this shooting range
place just outside of town.
It's like, ton of
gun nuts and weirdos.
Pay's pretty good though.
Oh, man don't work there.
- Why not?
- My dad runs it.
Oh my, God. I met
him yesterday.
- Fun.
- Wait. The bug guy?
Yeah, the bug guy.
So where are you staying?
Um, I'm actually not sure yet.
What does that mean?
I was gonna ask
if maybe I could
crash here couple of nights.
I mean, like, until I get
paid, you know, like...
Until I can afford
a room somewhere.
You can stay here.
I can just sleep on the couch.
No, shut the fuck up.
You can stay here.
- This is delicious.
- Good.
I mean, like, you
know, next time, maybe,
- take the yolks out, but...
- Oh, yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay.

What about your mom?
What?
She's gone... She's... It's, um.
It's been, like, 12 years.
You mean she's dead?
No, she's gone.
What's wrong? Why
are you stopping?
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Up, up, up, up.
God, fuck!
Oh, Lou, ew.
Ah! Hmm.
I can get a job somewhere
else if you want.
Do what you want.
That's not what
I'm paying you for.
I'm on my break, sir.
Come on.
Come on!
If you work here, you should
at least know the basics.
Line her up.
You only have to be
very, very gentle.
A bit more powerful
than a punch, huh?
One more time, line it up.
- Okay.
- That's it. Nice and easy.
Will you come
with me to Vegas?
I want you to see me win.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
But, you know, if you
don't win, that's okay.
Right?
Jesus.
Afterwards, let's
just keep driving.
Where?
California.
Yeah, if I win. I can
get a job as a trainer,
find a place by the
beach, swim in the ocean.
All that stuff.
Yeah, I've never been
anywhere but here.
Why not?
So, is the, um...
When is the contest?
- This Thursday.
- Mmm.
How are you feeling?
Mmm. Good, I think.
She's gonna knock 'em out.
Yeah, you look amazing.
Ooh, food.
Thanks.
- More?
- Yeah.
- Pineapple?
- No.
You guys will love
Vegas. It's wild.
I've heard. Have you gone?
We went for our
honeymoon, actually.
Stupid... Fucking things.
- You need help, hon?
- No, it's fine.
- You need a fork?
- No.
Just hold... JJ: I got it.
I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
- That's gonna stain.
- I know, I know.
What... What are
you... You can't just
rub my dick in the
middle of the restaurant.
I'm sorry.
Please don't.
What the fuck?
If you touch her
one more time...
What? What is it, Lou?
It'll be the last
fucking thing you do.
What the fuck did she
tell you this time, huh?
She doesn't have to tell
me shit. I have eyes.
Why don't you look closer
at your new
girlfriend, then, huh?
Instead of interfering in
shit you don't know about.
Yeah. Yeah, I met her
first night she
rocked up into town.
Took her out back of Daggers.
Gave it to her right
there in the parking lot.
She wanted that
job so fucking bad.
Let me tell you.
Although, I guess...
not as bad as she wanted
a free fucking gym
membership, huh?
Are you gonna be like this
the rest of the night?
Want me to drop
you off somewhere?
Drop me off?
JJ's?
Fuck, I knew that's why
you're being so weird.
Babe.
You fucked him.
I didn't know who
he was or anything.
I hadn't even met you yet.
I met you the day
after you got here.
So what? Fuck.
So you'd fuck guys?
I specifically asked you...
I like both.
I guess it doesn't
really matter who it is,
as long as they hook
you up with a job,
or a place to stay,
take out your egg yolks.
Did I get it?
Fuck you.
Yeah?
Hey, where the
fuck are you going?
- Where does it look like?
- Nowhere.
How could you fuck
that guy, baby?
Did you enjoy it?
'Cause he's beyond
sickening like...
Like, a fucking scumbag.
He beats the crap
out of Beth, Jack.
She's completely brainwashed.
She's the only reason
I stick around.
But maybe you think that I
don't have an actual life
outside of helping you
with your dumb shit.
Fuck you!
Of course, I do. But you
don't tell me anything.
I'm telling you now.
Look, look... That's
what's going on.
That's what's always
been going on.
The cops don't do anything
because she won't press charges.
I don't know what
the fuck to do.
I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't
share that with you.
You don't think I have
horror stories, Lou.
Huh? I got plenty.
You don't... You
don't understand.
This guy, I wanna...
I wanna do really...
I wanna do really bad...
I... I wanna fuckin' kill him.
Get back in the car.
Close the door, come on.
Just give me a second.
I thought you quit.
This doesn't count.
I'm wanna stretch you.
I wanna see how far you can go.
Do you put your fingers
inside when you fuck yourself?
How do you do it?
You wanna show me?
Come on, show me.
Is that really how you do it?
Good girl.
Oh, shit.
I love you.
I love you, too.
- Mmm.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, is... Okay, this is 08?
Oh!
Hey.
Oh, my God.
Paramedics picked
her up at 3:00 a.m.
Still waiting for
her to come round.
I'm not sure. Sometime
late last night.
Where the fuck is he?
If you're referring
to the husband
he's at the station
giving a statement.
A statement?
We're clear. We
know. He did this.
Ma'am, no one knows
exactly what happened.
Have you seen her?
We're gonna wait until
your sister wakes up
and then we're gonna ask if
she wants to press charges.
I'll make sure she gets
everything she needs.
It's best we take
care of JJ ourselves.
He'll regret this.
That's what you said last time.
She wouldn't wanna wake up
and find her husband in jail.
I wasn't thinking about jail.
She wouldn't want
him dead either.
I'd like to respect her wishes.
That's big of you.
Don't worry, little Bethany.
It's all gonna heal.
I'm sorry, Lou.
Fuck!
Ah! God, ah!
JJ, we gotta talk.
Pick up the phone.
Hello?
Shut the fuck up!
What the...
No, no, no, no!
No! I'm sorry.
Come on.
Nothing more you can do here.
This is crack cocaine,
seized a few days ago by
drug enforcement agents
in a park just across
the street from the mine.
Stop! Stop!
Could easily have
been heroin or PCP.
Oh!
Oh!
Jack.
Jack, are you okay?
Baby, are you okay?
Hmm?
Jackie?
Baby, what the fuck happened?
I made it right.
Oh, they're gonna
fucking fry you for this!
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.
What? Did anyone...
Did anybody see you?
Okay.
Fuck.
He's not gonna fit. I
think... I think we have to...
Let's... Let's unroll him.
Just push.
Okay.
All right. We're just
gonna go for a drive, okay?
I know a place.
Baby, go get my truck.
Follow me, okay?
Nope.
Lou-Lou.
Roll your window down.
Come on it's red, please.
- Hey, stranger.
- Daisy.
- New ride?
- No. I mean, yeah.
How you doing?
I'm good. Thank
you for asking.
Um, so what are you
doing out so late, huh?
Just driving, 'cause
I have a headache
- and it's a migraine.
- Poor, Lou-Lou.
Ugh! Smelly cunt...
Drive around!
Hey.
Ain't... Ain't that your truck?
Actually, I gotta go right now,
but we should go to Winkie's.
- Are you around tomorrow?
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Sounds fun. I love it.
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
Lou? Are you sure?
Trust me.
What is this place?
Hey, don't worry, Jack.
We're gonna be okay.
You just gotta
listen to me, okay?
You gotta do what I say.
So, I'm gonna go back to Beth's
to make sure we
didn't leave anything.
I think you should stay here.
Why don't you pack now?
And I'll come with you.
We could make it to
Vegas by the evening.
No, we can't go anywhere now.
Why not?
It's, um...
Hey, come here.
Come here. Come here.
Listen to me.
Someone's gonna see that
smoke. Like any minute.
And then the cops are
gonna find JJ's body.
It's okay. That's good.
'Cause there's other
shit down there.
There's other shit down there
that's gonna lead
them to someone else.
There's shit down
there that someone else
is gonna have to answer for.
Not you.
I have to go.
No, no, no, no. We have to...
- The competition's tomorrow.
- No, we have to stay here,
lay low and act real normal.
I was always gonna go.
You said you'd come with me.
Beth's safe now.
Okay.
Uh...
Can we talk about this later?
I love you.
Please stay here.
This is history in
the making, folks.
The German government said
tonight they'll be making
at least a dozen more
openings in the wall,
so that more people
can cross to the West.
The excitement in
the air is palpable.
The atmosphere is electric.
A celebration of the individual.
Ah!
JJ!
JJ, you here?
We gotta talk, buddy.
Serge.
Jeez. When's the last time
anyone took care of you?
Damn.
See anything?
Nothing.
He's not here, guys. Let's go.
Yeah, his car's gone.
Jackie?
Jack.
You didn't know anything?
Please. Do they
even know it's JJ?
Licence plates match.
My buddy said it
will be 24 hours,
before they can get down
there and ID the body.
- You sure it wasn't suicide?
- No.
Cars don't explode like
that when they crash.
Just in the movies.
With Beth in the hospital,
they're gonna be looking at you.
Who else knows about that place?
What do I pay you for?
Find out.
Ah, fucking...
Whoo! Ah!
Whoo! Oh.
Hey baby, Lou, come on.
Pack your bags, let's go!
I'm so fucking ready! Ah!
Pack your bags. We gotta go.
Mmm, God.
Jesus fucking Christ, Jack.
Where have you been?
I asked for one thing.
I asked you to do one
thing. I said stay home
while I sort out everything!
How much of that
stuff did you take?
- You didn't ask.
- What?
- You locked me in!
- Hey, whoa!
Jack?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come here.
You killed a man,
Jack. Did you get that?
Yeah. Yeah, you're welcome.
- You're fucking crazy.
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
This isn't a game, Jack.
We need to be so fucking
careful right now.
Forget about Vegas.
Ow! Ah!
Sorry, baby.
Wish me luck.
What?
Hey!
Where you headin'?
- Vegas!
Guess it's your lucky day.

Lou, did you talk to him?
Did you tell him to leave?
No, no.
You promise me?
Beth, I... Yeah.
He'll be back, honey.
This guy has a lot

I'll grab a soda.
You going to ignore me

This isn't about you or
me. This is about Beth.
She's the only fucking

I admire how protective
you are of your sister,
but maybe next time you might be
a little more careful
how you go about it.
- What are you talking about?
- They found JJ in his car.
Yeah. Mike filled me
in on the details.
What they know so far.
Great. I'm glad Mike's doing
some actual law enforcement
for a change.
Someone burnt it up pretty bad.
Maybe they didn't know
the smoke could be seen
for miles.

Security to the stage.
Knock it off!
- Stop!
- Uh! Come on!
I was waiting for you
at Winkie's last night.
Oh, yeah?
Sorry, I was, uh,
with my sister.
She's, you know,
in the hospital.
It's been a whole thing.
Oh, yeah.
I... I... I heard about
what happened to B.
Actually, I, um...
I brought you a
little something.
It's just a little something
to... to cheer you up.
I can't imagine how you
must be feeling right.
That's nice.
Um, you know, I... I quit.
All of it.
Oh, my gosh. Lou-Lou!
Do... Do you want me to stop?
No, but I just don't need this.
You should keep it.
No, save it.
For an emergency.
Sure was weird seeing
you the other night.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah. I was even
thinking about you
as I was walking along there.
I don't know why. It's just
a crazy coincidence, I guess.
- Crazy.
- Mmm-hmm.
Or fate.
I did wanna ask you
one thing, though,
and I understand if maybe
it's none of my business.
No, please. What?
What was she doing
driving your truck?
Who?
You know,
that big girl.
Thought you two were, maybe,
together or something.
I... I... I...
I'm not with her.
It's, like, she's
somebody that I...
I haven't seen her in a while.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it's a weird coincidence
that she was behind me.
Yeah, I thought
it was weird, too.
And that you were
driving JJ's car.
We hung out a couple of times.
I never forget a Camaro.
Court appearance
is in eight days.
Bail is set at $300.
You get one phone call.
Lou's residence. Howdy.
Who's this?
Stay away from her. She
doesn't want you anymore.
All right, Rambo. Your
guardian angel's here.
You and Lou fall
out or something?
That why you called me?
Don't worry. You
made the right call.
My guys will take care
of this whole problem.
You know, Lou and I have had
our share of arguments too.
I bet she's told you all
kinds of things about me.
That's her right.
Although, I find it a
little rich at times.
I own the gym.
She probably didn't
tell you that.
I know you didn't
ask for my advice,
but seeing how you're
sitting in my car,
I get to tell you anyway...
You can't go around
killin' people
without figuring out a
few of the details first,
you know what I mean?
Um, I wanna get out now, please.
I wanna get out.
All right, get out
if you want to.
What do you think this is?
But once you're out of this car,
you're on your own. You
know that, don't you?
I mean, really alone.
They found the body, the cops.
They're gonna ask questions.
You really don't think I
have anything better to do?
Hmm? I came out
here to help you.
Both of you.
You know, Lou won't
ask me for it.
She thinks she has
it all under control,
but she can't handle
a thing like this.
You're smarter than
that. I know you are.
Lou didn't do anything.
Why don't you close the door?
It's cold out there.
Call me when it's done.
You try and get some sleep now.
Thank you.
Ooh!
You sure you're not hungry?
Yeah, I... I just wanna
be boring for a second.
- And, uh...
- What is it?
I just wanna clear the air
on this whole JJ thing.
Well, he really had
it coming, didn't he?
Well, I mean, we weren't
friends or anything,
but it's pretty horrible.
What happened to him, you know?
I thought you were saying
how much you hated him.
Yeah, but I didn't
want him dead.
He was family.
Okay.
You know how we
ran into each other
at the lights the other night?
Mmm-hmm.
Did you tell anyone about that?
Like the cops or anyone?
I was thinking about it.
What were you
thinking of saying?
I thought they ought to know
that I saw that beefy girl
driving JJ's car that night.
But you didn't
'cause she wasn't.
- Wasn't she?
- No.
Sorry, I... I thought
you'd be pleased.
You said you weren't
together anymore.
- No, we're... we're not.
- That why you brought me here?
No, no. Hey.
I'm just...
Hey, I'm... I'm just looking
out for myself, you know.
Think about it, if
you tell the cops that
you saw her driving JJ's car,
they're gonna start
asking around.
They're gonna find
out we were dating,
that... that she
was staying with me.
And... And it would
be a whole thing.
And I don't wanna
get dragged into it,
because I'm... I'm scared, Daze.
Oh...
My God, Lou-Lou, I'm...
I'm such a dum-dum.
I didn't think of that.
Hey, it's okay. You were
just trying to help.
- Mmm-hmm.
- I appreciate it.
Don't talk to anyone.
Especially the cops, okay?
- 'Cause...
- Okay.
I actually don't even know
anything about what
happened to JJ that night.
He got smashed in the head
and set on fire, apparently.
Okay, so if anyone asks you,
you didn't see Jackie,
anywhere that night, right?
Must've been some other freak.
Exactly.
Thanks, Daisy.
God, I'm fucking starving now.
All right!
Oh, let's order margaritas.
- All right.
- Excuse me.
♪ Two margaritas please! ♪
So you're just getting
your things right?
Gotta go pick up Beth.
Hey, look. Hey, look.
Need to go to the
hospital, okay?
I'm... I'm... Baby.
I'm not... This isn't.
I'm not.
Huh?
Baby, what the
fuck are you doing?
Fuck. Fuck!
Jack!
Holy, fuck.
Shit!
Fuck! Fuck!
Yeah?
It's done.
She was with Lou.
- Hello?
- Hughey.
Jackie.
Mom said you ran
away. What's going on?
Don't ever fall in love, okay.
Okay, Hughey. It hurts.
Just don't ever fall in love.
Hughey, who is it?
Jackie. WOMAN:
Give me the phone.
Give me that.
Jacqueline, you stay away
from us, you monster!
Don't ever call
this house again!
FBI, open up.
This is the FBI,
Miss Langston.
Miss Langston,
I need you to open the door now.
Jesus Christ.
Open the fucking door.
Hey. Hey, sorry, one sec, uh...
We just wanna talk.
- Hey.
- You gonna let us in?
You didn't really catch
me at the greatest time.
It's about your
brother-in-law.
We really need to talk to you.
We won't take long.
Nice place.
You talked to
your dad recently?
I told you, we don't talk.
Is that right?
When your brother-in-law's
remains were recovered,
forensics also found these.
We suspect they're people
who threatened your dad
and his operation.
We've been trying
to shut him down
for a while now.
But as soon as someone
starts talking,
they have a habit
of disappearing.
Your brother-in-law
was the latest.
Real shame what happened to him.
Lost us our best informant.
Guess your dad caught wind, huh?
I'm not involved
in any of his shit.
But you were, weren't you?
Quite the sidekick,
we were told.
We've been trying to locate
your mom for a while now.
Wanted to ask her
what she remembers.
The last record we could find
was from 12 years ago.
It says she contacted
local police saying
that she wanted to talk
to 'em about her husband.
She never followed up.
Um...
Hmm.
The bullshit stops
now, Louise.
Now you just listen up and
do exactly as I tell you.
- You ready?
- I... Pfft... Huh?
I removed the witness
connecting you to JJ.
I protected you.
Not that I'm dumb enough
to expect gratitude for it.
You made her do that.
Well, she was in a
tight spot last night.
You should've helped her out.
- Where is she?
- I have her.
She'll be arrested
for double homicide,
and this whole mess
will blow over.
The cops are gonna
wanna talk to you.
Just tell them you
guys were having
some fun together,
you're horrified...
If you hurt her,
I'm gonna kill you.
Lou, shut the hell
up, and listen.
Unless you wanna answer
for that dead body
- in your apartment.
- Ugh!
I need you to sit tight
and do absolutely nothing.
I know you can manage that.
Just sit back. Let Dad take care
of everything.
No fucking way.
What did you think
was gonna happen, Lou?
I'd be arrested for a
murder I didn't commit.
What did you think
was gonna happen?
How many people are
down there, huh?
Seemed like a lot in those days.
Did you keep it up?
No one can connect me to bones.
I can.
Are you threatening me?
Yep.
Yeah, let her go
or I'm gonna call
the Feds right
now, and tell them
everything you ever did.
How's that sound, Dad?
Hmm?
Dad?
That was really stupid, honey.
Lou. Lou, are you there?
I'm waiting for you.
Please come and get me.
Lou!
He sent you to kill me?
Fuck you, you rat!
Oh, God!
Just get in the car.
Hey, Sharon.
Just ruining everything.
Oh!
Jackie?
I'm sorry,
- I didn't pick you up.
- Don't.
I don't... I don't
know what he told you.
Lou, he was my husband.
I know.
And I'm... I'm sorry, but...
I... I'm... I'm not sorry.
- What the fuck, Lou?
- I just...
What the fuck? Why?
Why?
Because he was gonna
kill you one day.
You... don't know
anything about love.
I'm so sorry for you.
I love... you. I love you.
Fuck off.
Wow.
You're a
moron.
Where are... Where are they?
Daddy's not here.
Really?
Where is she Beth?
- I don't know.
- Bethany!
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
You wanna tell me where she is?
- Ow!
- Huh?
Do you wanna be honest?
Do you wanna be honest with me?
Stop! Stop!
- Where is she?
- Fucking monster.
- In the corn house.
- Love you, sis!
Jack!
Jackie.
Oh, no!
Oh, my God.
Just... Just one second.
Sorry,
my family's so fucked!
I got you, I got
you. Hold on, baby.
Ow!
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey!
- Hey, I'm trying to...
- Fuck!
- Hey, come here.
- Get off of me.
- Oh, God. Hey...
- Let me go!
I'm helping you.
- Oh! Baby, what the fuck?
- You're selling me out?
How am I selling you out?
I... I love you.
Don't lie to me.
- No, I'm not.
- No, you couldn't wait
one night before you
fucked someone else!
Daisy? I did that for
you. She was gonna tell.
Oh!
- You want me to thank you?
- No, I'm...
Baby, I'm just saying
it wasn't like that.
If I was selling you out,
I'd be telling the cops
everything right now.
I'm not! I've got
Daisy's body in my truck.
I was gonna get rid of it
before anyone found out.
I mean, Christ, I am...
I am really trying...
Oh, fuck!
I wish I never met you.
I killed people, Lou.
I know.
I don't know what's
wrong with me.
Hey...
There is absolutely nothing.
wrong with you.
You are the most
amazing, most incredible,
beautiful person I've
ever met in my whole life.
He deserved it.
What about her?
My dad made you do it.
He does that.
You didn't have a choice, okay?
I fucking love you, you idiot.
I love you too.
What's gonna happen to us?
You're gonna be okay.
You just have to listen to
me this time, you got it?
Can you do that?
Okay.
Hmm.
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen.
You go that way,
there's a back road.
Wait for me there.
Stay out of sight. Make
sure no one sees you.
What about you?
I'll be fine. There's
something I gotta do first.
Feds are gonna be
here in two minutes.
Get the fuck out of here. Go!
Dad? Where the fuck are you?
Hey!
Ow! Ah!
Drop it.
You ungrateful brat.
God. Well...
It's over, man.
I told them everything.
You have no idea
what you've done.
Uh, yes, I do.
I've done the right
thing for the first time
- in my whole life, Dad.
- Oh, Jesus.
- You sound like your mother.
- Shut up!
You killed her, didn't you?
I get it. She was gonna tell.
I just wanna know. Did
you do it yourself,
or did you have Mike do it?
Your mom left
because she couldn't
stand being a wife to me,
and a mother to you.
You fucking liar.
I'm nothing like you.
That'd be nice wouldn't it?
Stop lying.
Oh...
Let go of me!
It's okay.
Come on.
- It's okay.
- Dad...
Everyone learns the hard way.
It's the ones you love
the most that always
disappoint you in the end.
Get off her!
What the fuck?
Oh, wow!
Lou, help me.
You know what?
I love you, too.
You sick fuck!
They're coming. Just finish it.
No. - Come on.
Bye, Dad.
