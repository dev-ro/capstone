What may I do for you

It's about the murder
of Sheriff Call.
I understand that there's
some physical evidence
relating to the case
that was lost?
Yes, sir.
I believe there was.
Well, we was wondering
what sort of explanation
the department might have.
I wish I knew.
Mr. Van Wetter once cut
a deputy's thumb off.
Did you know that?
It was over a traffic ticket,
if I remember.
You can't do much
without your thumb.
It's what separates us
from the primates.
For a little thing like
holding your wife's titty.
You're not married, Mr. Jansen?
No.
A little thing like that,
you can't do it.
Maybe I'll just go talk
to the deputies
who was involved in the arrest.
You can talk
to whoever you want
as long as they'll talk to you.
But they won't.
And why is that?
They haven't forgotten what
Hillary did to one of theirs.
The judge allowed testimony
based on evidence
that he never even saw.
He took the officer's word
over Hillary's.
I can't say I blame him.
Nobody does.

The deputies
went to Tyree's house,

sleeping in bed all night

Then they go to your house...
where they find the
bloodstained shirt and knife.

Goddamn it, he killed her.
He killed her, Ward.
You killed her!
You son of a bitch!
That's all you were good
for is killing her!
Huh?
Run, Jack!
Come on, boy.
Show me.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

Wetter was tried and convicted
in the murders of Charlotte
Bless and Ward Jansen.
He died in the electric chair
at the Florida State Prison.
Nobody ever found out who
murdered Sheriff Call.
My little Jack finally saw his
mama again at Ward's funeral.
He became a writer
of some renown.
He never did get
over his first true love.
