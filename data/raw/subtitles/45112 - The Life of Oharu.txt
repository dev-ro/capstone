THE LIFE OF OHARU

Directed by Kenji Mizoguchi
Oharu?
You didn't get a customer
either?
It's hard for a fifty year old woman
to pretend to be twenty
Don't think like that
I was chosen by an old man
from the pilgrims' inn
I thought I was lucky
I went in,
I found myself in a candlelit place,
as though praying to Buddha
He said to the young men:
"Look at this painted face
"Do you still want to buy a woman?"
I am nothing but a spectacle
of an ill-fated woman
You've had a bad time
from the start.
Osen, he's lit a fire again
We can get warm and go home!
I hear you served at the palace
I never expected you
to be doing this
What has led to your ruin?
Do not ask more about my past.
By the fire again?
All right, but be careful
Worried about your hair?
You haven't much to lose!
Where are you going?
I'm taking the first harvest fee
to Shimogorio,
at my master's order
You can see the town,
you are so rarely let out
I would be reprimanded
Pretend you didn't know
Kikukoji, you are up early
Saidoin is worried
because you haven't sent
a poem in return
He tells everything
Tell me about the daring poem
he sent you
Please
excuse me, sir
Mistress Oharu, please wait!
I am Katsunosuke,
servant of the noble Kikukoji
He wishes to speak to you in private
Please come to the house in town
I am sent on errand
Please spare a few minutes
after you have competed your errand
Mistress Oharu...
Have you read the letter
I gave you the other day?
Who would read such a letter
from a servant such as you?
I burned it without reading it
I have no talent
for poetry or witticism,
but I have sincerity.
You may look down on my class,
but do not scorn my sentiments.
If refinement is a game
of kicking words of sincerity
like a ball,
then I am not refined.
How can someone like you
ever understand refined taste?
You cannot appreciate
the taste of noble people.
Do you know
any noble who thinks of you
with sincerity
and who wishes to marry you?
Please go!
I say this for your happiness.
It is not your business.
I will give up,
if you dislike me.
I do dislike you.
Are you thinking of my humble origin?
Please leave!
Women can only be happy
if they marry for true love.
Status and money
are not happiness.
I told you to leave.
I did not come here
to listen to your story
I will wait for noble Kikukoji
alone.
Please leave
He will not come
Please wait!
I apologize,
but I was desperate to see you
I have thought of you
ever since you entered
service at the palace
Please accept my love
I did read your letter
Whatever you write,
I could never be with you.
Why not?
Neither the palace
nor my father
would allow it.
Then we must run away together
I will take good care of you
and make you happy
We have been told
that prostitutes use this inn.
Heaven forbid!
Whoever reported that?
Who are you?
I am a traveler
Whom do you work for?
Todo of Iga...
Insosuke
Where does this prostitute
come from?
Insolence! I am no such thing!
I am the daughter
of Tambanosuke Okui,
a temple guardian of Chionin.
You must come with us
Mistress Oharu,
despite being a servant
of the Imperial Household,
you have indulged
in immoral activity
with a man of humble origin.
For this offence,
you will be banished from the city.
The father and the mother
are reprimanded
and also banished from the city
for their lack of supervision.
Judgment given
the seventh of November, 1686.
Relatives may go no further.
Faithless daughter...
making us live here in shame,
ruining our ancient family.
Why is it sinful
for a man and a woman
to love each other?
What impudence!
You had a liaison with a man
whom we did not approve.
That is sin enough.
Our origins were different,
but what is wrong
in our sincere love?
Be quiet!
Is there anything you want to say?
Yes. A message for Mistress Oharu.
Tell me.
I wish you to find a good man
and make a happy home.
Promise me
you will marry
with true affection.
That's all?
Nothing else?
I hope the day will come
when all may be free to love
regardless of status.
Mistress Oharu!
The officials have given us
the will of Katsunosuke.
I have not told your father
I will join Katsunosuke!
That is not your world.
Death is the end of everything.
A messenger from Lord Matsudaira
Show him into the house at once
Is it something serious?
We are seeking
a concubine for our Lord
A fast palanquin
to seek a concubine...
It is no laughing matter!
Our Lady's health is poor,
there is no heir.
It is rumored that
our Lord's line may die out
If so, that is a serious matter
We have presented women
to our Lord,
but he dislikes country-bred women
His counselors are at a loss
They have the idea
that a young woman
may be found here in Kyo,
famous for its beautiful women,
so they've sent me in a hurry.
I thought you had come
to ask me for money.
If that's all you require,
it's easy.
On the contrary,
there are my conditions.
The Lord wishes the woman
to look like this.
Age: fifteen to eighteen
The face must be fashionable
and round
The Lord dislikes small eyes,
but the eyebrows must be thick
A shapely nose, a small mouth,
white teeth,
well-proportioned ears,
a clear brow,
a long neck
with no wisps of hair at the nape.
Long and slender fingers.
It is indeed
an extraordinary request.
There is more.
Feet must be rather small.
Longer than average torso,
small waist, well-rounded hips.
Well-mannered and good tempered.
No blemishes on the body.
The mouth's too big.
- What size are your socks?
- Medium, sir.
If I may say so,
no one but me
could gather so many girls together
in Kyo City.
I cannot do any more.
Can't you pick one of these?
If it's just to produce an heir,
good health is enough.
Thick eyebrows,
shapely nose, white teeth...
You know it by heart
I'll die before I find such a woman.
I'm sorry for you,
but why have they sent
someone as old as you?
The return journey would be risky
with a young man.
But with me,
no chance of misconduct.
It is Sharakubo,
he teaches music and dance
to girls of good family.
They are becoming popular
with the samurai
who invite them
to drinking parties.
Have you many moles?
A mole?
No, sir
Not even one?
Master Kahei, that's it!
The messenger is waiting.
I shall return and inform him.
This is a relief.
If she produces an heir,
it will bring happiness to all.
How grateful we are, sir
I never dreamed of such a thing.
Oharu this will wipe out
your ungrateful conduct.
Everything will be forgiven
I sent her to learn dancing to forget
The preparation allowance
is 100 ryo
You will receive rice, also
Aren't you pleased?
I'm to be the Lord's concubine
Why say it like that?
He is a great Daimyo
Once the Lord has been with you,
you will become a lady of the court.
You are as good
as a lady of the court already.
We must request
that Lord Matsudaira
is not told about that incident.
you must prepare
all you need to take to Edo
I do not wish to go
To produce a baby
for someone
whose face I do not know
Not an ordinary child:
the heir to a great Daimyo.
Katsunosuke would not forgive me.
Idiot!
You are still my daughter.
I will not allow you
to do as you please.
Excellent health.
There will be no difficulty
in producing a young lord.
Mistress Sasai, please
teach her manners and etiquette.
Show her to her Ladyship at once.
Your Ladyship,
Isobe has returned from Kyo
with a suitable concubine.
Already?
She is here.
Please see her.
You must endure everything
for the good of the family.
Her name is Oharu Okui.
Lift up your face
Greet Her Ladyship
Good
Do you miss your home?
Are you happy to see
your local puppets in Edo?
Is the food to your satisfaction?
Say if anything displeases you
The young lord is born.
Take the news at once.
A young lord is born
What a pretty child.
Just like you.
Really?
Is the Lord pleased?
Of course,
His Lordship is delighted.
I was unhappy
when I was brought here,
but since bearing the child...
You must say:
Since I was given the privilege
of bearing the child.
Since I was given the privilege
of bearing the child,
I feel it is my home.
My Lord is...
The happiest of occasions
for our clan.
Is it enough?
My child... I mean, young lord.
We will feed him!
I will feed him!
Thank you
With this cloth
I will make a fortune
Are you still worried about payment?
The great Daimyo Matsudaira
supports me
My master is very exacting
Master Kahei is worried?
My daughter has given birth
to a young lord
She as borne the heir
to a great fortune
I have received a letter
Do not worry about payment,
Do not worry
bring me lots of material.
Master Jihei, shall I bring the silk
intended for the Hishia shop?
Bring everything
Soon I shall have a shop
in Muromachi.
I will compete with your master
How about Mistress Oharu?
Since the birth of the young lord,
our Lord's affection has increased.
Well then, isn't that splendid?
Our Lord's strength is being drained.
The doctor say his concubine
is a danger to his health.
She is no longer needed
having produced an heir.
True, Isobe?
For the sake of the clan,
send her home.
Dismissed?
I'm at a loss for words
I was so proud of her
bearing the young lord
So you are back?
Why did you exert yourself so much?
After bearing the young lord
you could have been more reserved
Well, no point in talking about it
How much did they give you?
100 ryo would be appreciated
Only 5 ryo!
I have bought much cloth
in expectation of your promotion
I have taken out a large loan
For the sake of your parents,
go to live in Shimabara.
When I have enough money,
I will come and take you back.
You propose to sell your daughter?
It cannot be helped
But she has only just returned home
in sorrow
I always wanted
to enjoy myself in Shimabara
once before I die
I've toiled from morning till night
Now, I have enough money
to come here,
all the way from Echigo
after twenty years of work
Can't I come in?
what a beautiful woman
I'm sorry,
but our house is most exclusive
one needs an introduction
If it's a question of money...
Is this enough?
More than enough
I am the master of the house
So I can stay
Prepare the best room
Summon the courtesan
Thank you, sir
I brought a horse and groom
- the horse carries barrels of sake.
- the finest sake is prepared.
No need for all that
Why aren't you picking it up?
What impudence!
You are impudent
I am not a beggar
Is this your idea of duty?
What arrogance!
We have not summoned you
to enjoy yourself
You boast of your birth,
who knows if you are not
a beggar's daughter?
How dare you say
such a thing to me?
You've been bought
like a fish on the chopping-board
Its fate is up to the buyer
You needn't bother
to come to this house again
What will you parents say?
No one will employ you
if they know
I have thrown you out
I was wrong
Forgive me
I will change my manner
Please do not tell my employer
Not good enough. Go away.
The client wants the courtesan
I'll get him a better one
No, he says it's rare
not to want money nowadays
He says he'll pay for her
and he wants
to take her home to Echigo
Well, you've heard that
the client wants to have you
Cheer up and go to him at once
Do you really want
to take me to Echigo?
Frankly,
I came to Kyo to find a wife
I'll have you
Will you come with me?
If you are sincere,
I will serve you faithfully
Why do you laugh?
Money,
money!
If you have money,
the world is yours
When they see this, they crawl
Even the proudest woman
smiles and draws near
I have no such vulgar nature
I want to go with you because...
This is what you are worth
You fate is in money
Money,
money!
I thought
he was liberal with money!
He is a forger!
The punishment is beheading!
Please smile
I beg you
You are now an ordinary girl
How I looked forward to the day
when you would return
from Shimabara
Please smile,
and forgive me.
Where did you learn that song?
You cannot be an ordinary person
I am ashamed
Once I was a celebrated courtesan
Welcome
It is difficult to give orders
to a concubine of Lord Matsudaira
Kindly regard me as your sister
Stay with us and we will find you
a good marriage partner
My wife has few relatives
so I entrust her to you
I have a favor to request
Please listen to me
Please write
that you will never
disclose our secret
I would never do that
You will have only one task, Oharu
the care of my hair
This is unexpected
The person I used to have
can no longer come
I will do my best
to care for your hair
But my hair is
Such wonderful hair
It is not true
Since I fell ill last year,
my hair has been like this
I concealed it
when I was convalescing
with my family
It is difficult to keep the secret
If my husband ever finds out,
I will lose his affection
So please keep this...
I shall not tell anyone
You have had your hair done
It looks beautiful
How good Oharu is.
Well, dear...
why not adopt Oharu
and find a husband for her?
Someone in our shop?
They are not worthy enough
Should I charge that customer
for transport?
Jihei should know that
What now?
What about Ukonya's account?
Don't bother me with such things
Jihei will know
What are you staring at?
Bunkichi, what are you doing?
Tell them to bring tea
Good business improves a shop
Mistress Oharu,
please take tea to the shop.
Shall I take it?
No
May I watch you make it?
Wonderful!
Please do not embarrass me
Business is not so good this month
Oh, you are...
You've settled here?
What have you been up to
with her?
She's been entrusted to our care
And you always act the innocent
I don't understand
Haven't you bought her?
She was in Shimabara, wasn't she?
You mean THAT Shimabara?
Don't be so naive
It's the first time
you've heard of it?
Of course
You knew before
You brought her here on purpose!
What a stupid thought!
You knew, you introduced her
to Lord Matsudaira's messenger
You've been seeing her at Shimabara!
I've never set foot in the place
I'd hate to waste money
on such things
I even save on shoe leather
Your face tells me you're lying
A letter from Zeniya
Be careful
Will you cut your hair?
Cut it!
Why should I?
Such beautiful hair
You've come to steal my husband
I've heard what you're up to
How you've deceived me!
I had no such intention
Cut it! Cut it!
Not enough! Shorter!
If you can't do it,
I'll do it for you!
Where is my wife?
She has gone to pray
Oharu
you naughty girl,
I've heard all about you
I'm not criticizing you...
but you must have enjoyed it
Yet from your face,
you don't look that sort of woman
a born wanton
So that's how you toyed
with Lord Matsudaira
I'm not such a...
Don't worry
now its in the open,
you can relax with me
I can have a woman without paying
Tama,
fetch something
that has this smell
Have you got the smell?
What's the matter?
Look what you've done to my hair
Go back to bed!
She's had a nightmare
- Some more?
- Thank you, that's enough
Don't worry
you are too young
to surrender your life
When all's said
the world is as kind as it is cruel
Yakichi
this gentleman will be set up
in business by his master
He asks for your hand in marriage
I must be going
What about that matter?
Please tell her
Such a modest gentleman
He has worked hard
and has served his master well
You're lucky, he wishes to marry you
But he will find me...
Has he been told of my past?
We told him everything
and tried to dissuade him
He says he is
all the more determined
to marry an unfortunate
such as you
He must be in love with you really
Leaving already?
You worked so late last night
I worked almost until dawn
Why not rest before you go out?
I must deliver some things today
On the way back
I'll bring you an obi
I would like to buy
a dance fan for her
These are the finest quality
What a lovely shop
Marry soon and have such a shop
What a lovely business
I hear that your young husband
is a fine man
He thinks of business
You are very pretty
you must make a fine couple
Any children?
No yet
Terrible news. Your husband...
He must have been murdered
for money
He was clutching this obi
As the saying goes:
the morning's pretty face
is a corpse by evening
Nothing is certain in this world
What will you do now?
The shop was sold by his uncle
What about you?
I shall return home
Did you receive a legacy?
No, nothing
I do not wish for anything
I merely wish to be a nun
and be near to Buddha
Please, will you guide me?
Bunkichi, are you there?
Look here, Bunkichi,
who owes us this money?
An acquaintance of mine
Credit is not allowed
Go and get the money tomorrow
Could you wait another month?
No
If it's difficult for you to get it,
tell me who it is.
Tell me!
Master Jihei. It's been a long time.
You have shamelessly
cheated Bunkichi.
How dare you say that?
He discovered that I was here
and he brought me some cloth
All the same, I want to paid
for what he brought you.
If you can't pay, give it back
The cloth has been made up
Then you must
give me the garments
We know each other well enough
to do away with formalities
Formalities?
I'm not Bunkichi
How dare you talk to me like that,
you whore?
Here...
Take them.
You are wearing them?
Take this obi.
You needn't take them off.
Take this kimono
I'll return everything.
Sekichi,
this will take some time
Buy some cake and tea,
take your time
Oharu, you must be tired
Leave!
It's disgusting
even to look at your face.
It is not what you think.
It is all his fault.
Believe me.
You wish to become a nun?
How can you say such a thing?
You have tried to deceive me.
What a disgrace!
Leave!
What has happened?
I had to leave the temple
I've been dismissed, too.
Let's run away together.
I will make you happy
Don't worry about money
I took some when I left the shop
Bunkichi, that is terrible
Anyway, they think
I've run away with you
Have some, it's good
Have an egg
Master Jihei!
Whore! Just you disappear!
What's the matter with you?
She hadn't eaten for three days
It's getting colder, too
Have more to eat.
Your hair is getting gray
So is yours
How can I, with my wrinkles...
have the nerve to talk
like a girl of twenty
to attract men?
What a cheek!
Why don't you go out
and make money?
It takes your mind off things
I'm too old to do it like you
You talk like a virgin
It is shameful,
but who will help us
if we do not help ourselves?
True,
death is easy
but life is not so simple.
Lets' drink this sake while it lasts
it will make us feel better
We cant get any lower
We can get some clothes for you
if you like
It's all the same
whatever we do
Boss, here's a newcomer
Give her some clothes
You, is it?
You'll make money
The kimono will cost you three bu.
One bu for the obi and socks,
that's the rate.
This is too gaudy
If you don't wear such clothes,
you won't do any business
Work hard
and repay me soon
Now go away,
you old witch!
Put it on
Young man!
Let's have some fun
What an old hag!
Sister,
come with me
Do sit down
It's cold
Shall I sing a song?
Tell me what you want
You're fine just as you are
It would be even better
if you didn't speak
in an artificial voice
Come this way
Well, all of you,
take a good look at this woman
Look at this painted face
Do you still want to buy a woman?
You are
on a pilgrimage.
If you want to learn
about the transience of life...
look at this goblin cat
Thank you. That is all.
You may go home
You can tell them at home
that you have spoken to a goblin cat.
Thank you
What are you doing here?
I've been looking at a statue
of a disciple of Buddha.
He resembles...
Who?
Look there
for a face you remember
The statues resemble so many
I see what you mean
They have funny faces
What's wrong?
It's your mother
I'm so gad I've found you
Why are you here?
She's been looking for you
ever since it was rumored
that you were here
I'm so glad you are alive
Where is father?
He is dead
He never forgot you
Don't cry
You will be happy
Me? Happy?
It is true
Now you will be able
to live in a fine house
A messenger came
from Lord Matsudaira
The young Lord
has succeeded his late father
My child!
He has become the Lord
and he wishes to care for you
as his true mother
Then I can see him?
I can live with him?
What wonderful news!
Shinozaki. Tashiro. Inform her.
Have you forgotten the gratitude
you owe to His late Lordship?
To the clan?
A most prestigious family
granted the title of Genji
by our noble Saiwa Emperor.
Our late Lord was the fourth.
Lord Yoshitaka
has succeeded him as the fifth.
You were given the privilege
of being his mother
What a disgrace to lower yourself
to being a prostitute.
Are you not ashamed?
If you wander around like that,
the Matsudairas will be disgraced.
Should the Imperial Court find out,
the consequences would be immense.
Therefore you will be sent home
to remain in retirement.
Day and night,
ask the spirit of the late Lord
for pardon.
With great compassion,
you will be granted the honor
of seeing the Lord.
Bid your farewell.
Please, may I go closer?
He is my child.
I gave birth to him.
Has she not come out yet?
What is taking so long?
We lost her in the garden.
Send a search party!
Inform the counselors!
We have lost that old woman.
Send a search party!
