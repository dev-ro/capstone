realm mercilessly and without laws.
A peasant, an honest and hardworking,
found himself once owed the king.
But peasants had what to pay.
So I asked him the king of price
thing we have...
Two daughters preafrumoase its...
Peasants did not want to give...
So I killed him.
The two girls were made to serve
and the king needs his friends.
One too weak fu for their desires.
Other sister was strong...
A patient. And he learned
about the nature of men.
The poor was my sister.
No wonder not you recognize me,
I was only 10 years...
