 SABOTAGE
  -Sand! 
  -Sabotage!
  -Bring! 
  -Deliberate!
  -What's behind this? 
  -Who did it?
  I know the law.  You have standards, 
  thereby breached the law.
  It happened everywhere. 
  Look at the street.
  -I may be in the dark in my house. 
  -Yes, but is free.
  It is a shame to
  rob the people.
  We want you to return the money.
  But this is the nature of providence, 
  as an earthquake or a thunderbolt.
  -Or a baby. 
  -It would be nice not to interfere?
  -We want our money. 
  -I'm sorry, arrived late.
  I just take my 
  dinner in the dark.
  I am half his ear.
  They want their money back.
  Hopefully, Mr. Verloc back.
  Not even saw the movie!
  -They are getting nasty. 
  -Nasty? Leave them to me.
  -Hey, you?  What's happening?
  Give me a flashlight.
  We blame the lack of light?
  If you hit a cop, the government
  asks that you return the money?
  -I paid for my seat ...
  -And that supported by the feet?
  -Carl, when you returned home? 
  -I haven't been out.
  It was not 20 minutes. 
  I call it low.
  Sleep.  that guides me 
  with that?  Light the lamp.

  -The fuse burned?
  No, it's a blackout. 
  The public wants the money.
  -They are disappointed.
  Good, return.
  -We can not do that.
  -Yes, yes we can.
  We will be without funds.
  When he says that does not cover the expenses.
  It is not worth fighting with the
  public.  I have got some money.
  If you are saying.
  If we were to be generous, be
  properly.  Give them an explanation.
  -No, you are accustomed to.
  Good, but I think you're crazy.
  -I tell you that is the work of God.
  -What do you mean by work of God?
  His face, and not to return
  the money for it.
  If a plane drop a bomb,
  this is the work of an enemy.
  When dry the juice alone,
  this is the work of providence.
  A work is any activity
  performed by a real action.
  Do not miss 
  that is outside the light ...
  It's a very debatable.
  -Discuss então.Que pay!
  - Yes! 
  -What we return the money!
  How?  Applying sanctions? 
  Know the details of the agreement?
  Article 257 line 6 section 24

  -What time?
  -that question? 
  -I can be in 2 places at once.
  I suppose not.
  Back later.
  -find something? 
  -I am not sure.
  Well, say 
  What is this?
  "" Bartolomé ...""?
  It is a can of a movie, right? 
  Verloc says you have not left.
  -No, not out. 
  -Whether the film is hers.
  Me looking for, sir? 
  -Meet with the Hollingshead.
  You are in petshop.  Do not enter. 
  Just keep your eyes open.
  Well, Spencer, go there.
  What we believe is that, sir? 
  "" Bartolomé, the strangler "."
  It&#39;s a can of a movie, right? 
  -No, of sardines.
 Extra!  Erupts a bomb!
  Will be fine.  You can take care of themselves 
  same.  There&#39;s no need to worry.
  Give me a penny.
  "Bartolomé, the strangler", 
  runway in the explosion of a bus ""
  - If you draw! 
  - Let her breathe!
  I want to see Mr. Verloc. 
  I want to see Mr. Verloc.
  I would not do harm to the boy.
  Come on, Sylvie, we have to think 
  No tomorrow.
  Need to hang out with eye 
  if they come for me.
  You have to calm down.
  Be reasonable. 
  What would you if I lose?
  That pig&#39;s aquarium, this cynical, 
  that gross dangerous, insane ...
  You do not know. 
  It is true.
  Did not want to worry about. 
  I am well.
  It was not his subject.
  to calm down. 
  The fact, is done.
  Go back to sleep.
  What we need is 
  a crying time.
  I know how you feel. 
  I do not believe that affects?
  Believes that died 
  by my fault?
  No, it was the fault of his friend 
  of Scotland Yard.  you blame him!
  I would have taken, but I 
  monitored.  I could not escape.
  Look ... now ... 
  You need to think in the future.
  Possibly ...  if we had a son.
  Stevie is slowing.
  Forgive.
  Gotta go now.
  You are more calm. 
  That&#39;s better.
  It could make peas? 
  You know that I love.
  I do not want more cabbage. 
  We could ask the grocery ...
  I do not think it has more
  what to do
  some things ...
 Stevie! Stevie!
  -Did you know? 
  -Yes.
  Sorry.
  I do not know what to say.
  -You know how I came. 
  -Yes.
  -I have to arrest him. 
  -Yes.
  If I could help. 
  For you, not for him.
  Do what is for you.
  It is very nice, Ted. 
  You can not do anything.
  Things are so terrible.
  We have evidence against him, 
  not anything happen to you.
  It is not good now. 
  There should tell you
  ... but before I take that 
  I want you to know ...
  ... how much it means to me.
  Did not mean 
  what we felt for you
  Is it better that I put my coat. 
  Do not I stop shaking.
  -What happened? 
  -I killed Steve.
  -I do not have cold.  Come on. 
  -Where?
  -TO police. 
  -No, wait.  Hold on!
  -It can not be so. 
  -Let me go.
  Not guilty. 
  I know it was an accident.
  -Please, let me go. 
  -I know and nobody else.
  What chance would ante 
  a judge and a jury?
  -Don &#39;t care. 
  -There &#39;s nothing to live for?
  Look at me. 
 -Ted!
  We&#39;ll leave it.
  -No.  It would be his ruin. 
  -When hell with it!
  We can go to the mainland without a passport 
  with tickets for the weekend.
  The train leaves at 9.
  Who can enter this 
  comfortable?  Only Mrs. Jones?
  Arrives at 8 in the morning.
  8 in point.  And he says he 
  there is no possibility.
  We have 12 hours 
  before that they find.
  Shut up! 
  Not a word more.
  Go to the movies and bring this cage 
  before that the police find.
  How can you be so stupid?
  - A cage with a bomb inside! 
  -I could not help it.
  Now you can. 
  Here, his coat.
  It&#39;s risky ... 
  -Who?  For you?
  And I and the girl? 
  Do not run risks?
  Get this cab! 
  And that brings cage!

 -OH!  Where was, Spencer?
  -Did you know that we wanted to question it? 
  -Yes.  I want to make a statement.
  -Statement?  What kind? 
  -You can do it later.
  Okay. 
  It has to do with your husband?
  -reached his men, sir. 
  -I will now.
  Wait here in the car.
  Her husband will come with us.
  Mrs. Verloc!
  No time.  Stay in the car. 
  How many men were ...?
  Mr. Verloc?
  Come on.  Open.  Avoid
  a lot of problems.
  Open and I will skip 
  by air!
  -Maybe you have a bomb. 
  -Evacuate the cinema.  I monitored.
  I will stay. 
  You have wife.
  More reasons to stay. 
  Cut to the public.
  It has a bomb. 
  will blow.
  A-bomb?  Verloc is there? 
  -Maybe you did something.
  I ask them to leave the room ...
  -Your husband is in there? 
  -Do not know.
  -why do you respond? 
  -Yes, it is there.
  The old man has a bomb.  Believes 
  that her husband can control it?
  -No. 
  -You can not?
  Is dead!
  -Everything flew by air. 
  -Someone ...
  The public was gone. 
  Thank God.
  I saw some sutures in the war, 
  but ...
  -They can be identified? 
  -No way.
  Call someone for first 
  Aid to see the head.
  Take care of Mrs. Verloc.  Her husband 
  died.  flew into pieces.
  Tell him investigate. 
  It has nothing against it.
  We have to make some 
  investigations.  Nothing against her.
  Yes, sir.
  Curious.  You guess? 
  Verloc said it was ...
  Dead?  No need for power 
  in such cases.
  But she said this before.
  Or was it after?
  I can't remember.
