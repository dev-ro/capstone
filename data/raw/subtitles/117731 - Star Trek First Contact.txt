Locutus.
I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.
Authorization Picard-
four-seven-alpha-tango.
Admiral.
This a bad time, Jean-Luc?
Of course not.
I've just received a disturbing
report from Deep Space Five.
Our colony on Ivor Prime
was destroyed this morning.
Long-range sensors
have picked up-
I know. The Borg.
Captain's log,
stardate 50893.5.
The moment I've dreaded for
nearly six years has arrived.
The Borg,
our most lethal enemy...
have begun an invasion
of the Federation...
and this time,
there may be no stopping them.
How many ships?
One,
on a direct course for Earth.
They'll cross the Federation
border in less than an hour.
Admiral Hayes is mobilizing
a fleet in the Typhon sector.
At maximum warp, it will take
3 hours, 25 minutes-
We're not going.
What do you mean?
Our orders are
to patrol the neutral zone...
in case the Romulans decide to
take advantage of the situation.
The Romulans?
Captain, there's been
no unusual activity...
along the Romulan border
for the last nine months.
It seems unlikely they'd choose
this moment to start a conflict.
Does Starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time?
We've been in space
nearly a year. We're ready.
The Enterprise E is the most
advanced starship in the fleet.
We should be on the front line.
I've gone over this
with Starfleet Command.
Their orders stand.
Number One, set a course
for the neutral zone.
Bizet?
Berlioz.
What do you have?
We finished our first sensor
sweep of the neutral zone.
Oh, fascinating.
Twenty particles of space dust
per cubic meter...
fifty-two ultraviolet
radiation spikes...
and a Class Il comet.
This is worthy of our attention.
Why are we chasing comets?
Let's just say Starfleet
has every confidence...
in the Enterprise and her crew.
They're not sure
about her captain.
They believe a man
who was captured...
and assimilated by the Borg...
shouldn't be put in a situation
where he would face them again.
To do so would introduce
an unstable element...
into a critical situation.
That's ridiculous.
Your experience makes you
perfect to lead this fight.
Admiral Hayes disagrees.
Bridge to Captain Picard.
Go ahead.
We've received word
from the fleet.
They've engaged the Borg.
Put Starfleet frequency
one-four-eight-six on audio.
Aye, sir.
Flagship to Endeavor.
Stand by to engage at grid A-15.
Acknowledged.
We have it in visual range-
a Borg cube on course
zero mark two-one-five.
Speed-warp nine point-
We are the Borg.
Lower your shields
and surrender.
We will add your biological and
technological distinctiveness...
to our own.
Your culture will adapt
to service us.
Resistance is futile.
They've broken
through the defense perimeter.
The cube is changing course.
Zero-two-one mark four.
Starfleet Command,
we need reinforcements.
Ninety-six dead,
22 wounded on the Lexington!
This is Commander Luxi
on the Madison...
Lieutenant Hawk,
set a course for Earth.
Aye, sir.
Maximum warp.
I'm about to commit
a direct violation of orders.
Any of you who wish to object
should do so now.
It will be noted in my log.
I believe I speak
for everyone when I say...
to hell with our orders.
Red alert.
All hands to battle stations.
Engage.
Report!
Our weapons are gone.
Perhaps today
is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed!
Sir, there's another starship
coming in.
It's the Enterprise.
The Defiant's
losing life support.
Transporter room, beam
the Defiant survivors aboard.
The admiral's ship
has been destroyed.
What's the Borg cube's status?
It has sustained
heavy damage to its outer hull.
I am reading fluctuations
in their power grid.
On screen.
Number One,
open a channel to the fleet.
Channel open.
This is Captain Picard.
I'm taking command of the fleet.
Target all your weapons
onto the following coordinates.
Fire at my command.
The coordinates
you have indicated...
do not appear to be
a vital system.
Trust me, Data.
The fleet's responded.
They're standing by.
Fire.
Mr. Hawk, pursuit course.
-Engage.
-Aye, sir.
What?
I hear them.
I have a patient who
insists on coming to the bridge.
Welcome aboard, Mr. Worf.
Thank you, sir.
The Defiant.
Adrift, but salvageable.
Tough little ship.
Little?
We could use help at Tactical.
You do remember
how to fire phasers?
Sensors show
chronometric particles...
emanating from the sphere.
They're creating
a temporal vortex.
Time travel.
Data, report.
We're caught in a temporal wake.
Captain...Earth.
The atmosphere contains...
high concentrations of methane,
carbon monoxide, and fluorine.
Life signs?
Population-
approximately nine billion.
All Borg.
How?
They must've done it
in the past.
They went back and assimilated
Earth, changed history.
lf they changed
history, why are we still here?
The temporal wake...
must have protected us
from changes in the time line.
The vortex is collapsing.
Hold your course,
Mr. Hawk.
We must follow them back...
repair whatever damage
they've done.
Come on.
Good night, Eddy.
Go home.
You're gonna regret this
tomorrow.
One thing you should
have learned about me by now...
is I don't have regrets.
Come on, Lily.
One more round.
Z, you've had enough.
I'm not going up in that thing
with a drunken pilot.
I sure as hell am not
going up there sober.
What is that?
That is
the constellation Leo.
No. That.
It's an Econ!
After all these years?
We gotta get to the Phoenix.
To hell with the Phoenix.
Help!
Move out! This way!
Run!
Report.
Shields are down.
Long-range sensors are off-line.
Main power's holding.
According to
our astrometric readings...
we are in the mid-21st century.
From the radioactive isotopes
in the atmosphere...
I estimate we have arrived
10 years after World War Ill.
Makes sense.
Most of the major cities
have been destroyed.
Very few governments left.
600 million dead.
No resistance.
Captain...
Mr. Worf, quantum torpedoes.
Ready, sir.
Fire.
They were firing at the surface.
Location?
Western hemisphere,
North American continent.
Looks like a missile complex
in Central Montana.
Missile complex...
The date.
Data,
I need to know the exact date.
April 4...2063?
April 4th-
the day before first contact.
Precisely.
The missile complex
must be where Zefram Cochran...
is building his warp ship.
That's what they
came to do-stop first contact.
How much damage, Lieutenant?
Can't tell. Long-range
sensors are still off-line.
We have to go down,
find out what happened.
Data, Beverly, you're with me.
Have a security team meet us
in transporter room three.
Computer, mid-21st century
civilian clothing.
Number One,
you have the bridge.
Over here.
They're all dead.
See if one of them
is Cochran.
Data, let's go check
the warp ship.
The structural integrity
of the missile appears intact...
but there is
significant damage...
to various sections
of the fuselage...
and primary intercooler system.
We have blueprints
in the Enterprise computer.
Commander La Forge will need
to bring a team here-
Hold your fire!
We're here to help!
Bullshit!
Captain,
I believe I can handle this.
Greetings.
Captain, this woman
requires medical attention.
Severe theta radiation
poisoning.
The radiation's from
the damaged throttle assembly.
We all have to be inoculated.
-I have to get her to sick bay.
-Doctor...
No lectures
about the Prime Directive.
-I'll keep her unconscious.
-Very well.
Tell Riker to beam
down with a search party.
We need to find Cochran.
Crusher to Enterprise-
two to beam
directly to sick bay.
In less than 48 hours,
this ship has to be launched.
Picard to Engineering.
La Forge here.
Geordi,
Cochran's ship was damaged.
Come with an engineering detail.
We have work to do.
I'm on my way.
Alpha team, let's assemble
in transporter room three.
We're heading to the surface.
Porter, you're in command
till I get back.
And check out the environmental
controls while I'm gone.
It's getting warm in here.
Let's go.
Isn't it amazing?
This ship used to be
a nuclear missile.
It's an historical irony
that Cochran would choose...
an instrument of destruction
to inaugurate an era of peace.
It's a boyhood fantasy.
I've seen this ship hundreds
of times in the Smithsonian...
but I was never able
to touch it.
Does tactile contact alter
your perception of the Phoenix?
Yes.
For humans, touch can
connect you to an object...
in a very personal way,
make it seem more real.
I am detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing...
temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.
It is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago.
Would you three
like to be alone?
What have you found out?
There's no sign
of Cochran in the complex.
He has to be here.
There was nothing more important
to him than this ship.
This flight was his dream.
We should
consider the possibility...
that Dr. Cochran was killed
in the attack.
lf that's true...
the future may die with him.
What do you think?
The environmental
system's gone crazy.
It's not just Engineering.
It's the entire deck.
Maybe it's a problem
with the E.P.S. conduits.
Hello?
Hey!
Are you talking to me?
Is anyone else
working in this section?
Not that I know of.
Aah!
Paul?
Paul?
Are you OK in there?
Aah!
Captain? What is it?
Picard to Enterprise-
Mr. Worf,
is everything all right there?
Yes, sir.
We're experiencing environmental
difficulties on deck 16...
but that is all.
What kind of difficulties?
Humidity levels
have risen 73%...
and the temperature has jumped
10 degrees in the last hour.
Mr. Data and I
are returning to the ship.
Number One,
take charge down here.
Aye, sir.
Damage to her
cell membranes is repaired.
She should be fine...
but I'd like to run another test
on her spinal tissue.
And find out why
it's so hot in here.
Now what?
Crusher to Engineering.
Crusher to Bridge.
Worf, I need to know
exactly what's been happening.
We just lost contact
with deck 16-
communications,
internal sensors, everything.
I was about to send
a security team to investigate.
No. Seal off deck 16.
Post security teams
at every access point.
Aye, sir.
Before we
lost internal sensors...
what were the exact conditions
in Main Engineering?
Atmospheric pressure was
2 kilopasquals above normal-
ninety-two percent humidity,
39.1 degrees Celsius.
39.1 degrees Celsius...
like a Borg ship.
They knew their ship was doomed.
Our shields were down.
Somehow they transported here
without being detected.
They'll assimilate
the Enterprise, and then...
Earth.
Picard to Riker.
Enterprise to away team.
Respond.
Main control
is being rerouted...
through Main Engineering-
weapons, shields, propulsion.
Quickly, Mr. Data,
lock out the main computer.
I have isolated
the main computer...
with a fractal encryption code.
It is unlikely the Borg
will be able to break it.
The Borg have cut primary
power to all decks except 16.
The Borg won't stay on deck 16.
Wake up. You're all right.
Come on. Wake up.
Hmm !
Stay calm.
You are all right.
You are gonna be fine.
I need you to do as I say.
Alyssa, is the E.M.H. program
still on-line?
It should be.
That's a girl.
I swore I'd never use
one of these.
Computer,
activate the E.M.H. program.
E.M.H. Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.
Twenty Borg
are about to break through.
We need time to get out.
Create a diversion.
This isn't part of my program.
I'm a doctor, not a doorstop.
Do a dance, tell a story.
I don't care.
Just give us a few seconds.
Ahem.
According to Starfleet
medical research...
Borg implants can cause
severe skin irritations.
Perhaps you'd like
an analgesic cream?
Which way?
We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.
First thing they'll do
in Engineering...
is establish a collective-
a central point from which
they can control the hive.
If we fire particle weapons
in Engineering...
there's a risk
we may hit the warp core.
Our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks.
-Data?
-Excellent idea.
Plasma coolant liquefies
organic material on contact.
But the Borg are not
entirely organic.
True, but like all
cybernetic life forms...
they cannot survive without
their organic components.
I have ordered
all weapons to be set...
on a rotating modulation.
The Borg will adapt quickly.
We will be able to fire
12 shots at most.
One other thing-
You may encounter
Enterprise crew members...
who have already
been assimilated.
Don't hesitate to fire.
Believe me,
you'll be doing them a favor.
Let's go.
Deanna?
Deanna!
Deanna!
No, no! Don't turn off that-
Who is this jerk?
Who told him he could
turn off my music?
Will Riker...
Zefram Cochran.
He a friend of yours?
Yes.
-Husband?
-No.
Good.
Now, this, Dina...
Deanna.
This...is the good stuff.
-Dr. Cochran-
-Shh!
To the Phoenix...
may she rest in peace.
Ohh.
OK...that wasn't so good.
Will, I think we have
to tell him the truth.
-But the time line-
-Time line?!
This is no time
to argue about time!
We don't have the time.
What was I saying?
-You're drunk.
-I am not.
Yes, you are.
He wouldn't talk to me
unless I had a drink with him.
Then it took three shots
of something called tequila...
just to find out he was
the one we're looking for.
I've spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me.
So don't go criticizing
my counseling technique.
Sorry.
It's a primitive culture.
-I'm just trying to blend in.
-You're blended, all right.
I told our cover story.
He didn't believe me.
We're running out of time.
If we tell the truth,
do you think he can handle it?
lf you're looking
for my professional opinion...
as Ship's Counselor...he's nuts.
I'll be sure
to note that in my log.
Captain, I believe
I am feeling...anxiety.
It is an intriguing sensation.
A most distracting-
I'm sure
it's a fascinating experience...
but you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now.
Good idea, sir.
Done.
Data, there are times
that I envy you.
It's only me!
Are you all right?
Yes, but we have wounded here.
Lopez,
get these people to deck 14.
There was a civilian-
a woman from the 21st century.
-We got separated.
-We'll watch for her.
She has no idea what's going on.
Try to find her.
Lower your weapons.
They'll ignore us
till they consider us a threat.
The manual release.
Mr. Worf, hold this position.
Manual release is on-line.
Perhaps we should just knock.
Data.
Ready phasers!
Data, cover me.
Captain, they've adapted!
Aah!
Regroup on deck 15.
Don't let them touch you!
Captain!
Data!
Uhh!
Here!
Help.
Please, help.
Aah!
You!
-How did you-
-Back off!
-Calm down!
-Shut up!
Who are you?
Jean-Luc Picard-
No! Who are you with?!
What faction?
I'm not a member of
the Eastern Coalition.
Shut up!
I don't care who you're with.
Get me out of here. Now!
That isn't going to be easy.
Find a way, soldier,
or I'll push buttons.
All right!
Follow me.
Slow!
Your efforts to break
the encryption codes...
will not be successful...
nor will your attempts
to assimilate me...
into your collective.
Brave words.
I've heard them before...
from thousands of species
across thousands of worlds...
since long before
you were created.
But now, they are all Borg.
I am unlike any life form
you have encountered.
The codes in my neural net
cannot be forcibly removed.
You are an imperfect being
created by an imperfect being.
Finding your weakness
is only a matter of time.
Let me make sure
I understand you, Commander.
A group of cybernetic creatures
from the future...
have traveled back through time
to enslave the human race...
and you're here to stop them?
That's right.
Hot damn. You're heroic.
We're gonna
prove it to you. Geordi?
There she is.
Beautiful!
All right, take a look.
Well, well, well.
What we got here?
I love a good peep show.
That's a trick.
How'd you do that?
It's your telescope.
That's our ship,
the Enterprise.
And Lily's up there now?
-That's right.
-Can I talk to her?
We've lost contact.
We don't know why yet.
What is it you want me to do?
Simple.
Conduct your warp flight
tomorrow morning as you planned.
Why tomorrow morning?
Because at 11:00...
an alien ship will begin passing
through this solar system.
Alien.
You mean extraterrestrials?
More bad guys?
Good guys.
They're on a survey mission.
They have no interest in Earth.
Too primitive.
Oh.
When they detect
your ship's warp signature...
and realize humans can now
travel faster than light...
they decide to alter
their course...
and make first contact
with Earth right here.
Here?
Actually, over there.
It is a pivotal moment
in human history.
You make first contact
with an alien race...
and after you do,
everything begins to change.
Your theories on warp drive...
allow fleets of starships
to be built...
and mankind to start
exploring the galaxy.
It unites humanity in
a way no one thought possible...
when they realize they're not
alone in the universe.
Poverty, disease, war-
they'll all be gone in 50 years.
But unless you make that
warp flight tomorrow morning...
before 11:15,
none of it will happen.
And you people,
you're all astronauts...
on some kind of star trek.
I know this is
a lot for you to take in...
but we're running out of time.
We need your help.
What do you say?
Why not?
It's pretty bad, sir.
It looks like they control
decks 26 up to 11.
But when they took deck 11,
they just stopped.
The Borg have assimilated
more than half the ship...
in a matter of hours.
Why stop there?
What is on deck 11?
Hydroponics,
stellar cartography...
deflector control.
No vital system.
They wouldn't stop unless
it gave a tactical advantage.
Return to your checkpoint.
Send reports every 10 minutes.
Something
must've happened in sick bay.
Where are Dr. Crusher
and the others?
Why did you break
the cease-fire?
We didn't attack you.
Who did?
There's a new faction...
that wants to prevent
your launch tomorrow morning...
but we're here to help you.
This may be difficult
for you to accept...
but you are not
in Montana anymore.
You're on a ship-
a spaceship-
orbiting the earth
at an altitude-
You wanna help me,
get me outta here.
All right.
You want a way out, here it is.
What is this?
Australia...
New Guinea, the Solomons.
Montana will be up soon.
But you may want
to hold your breath.
It's a long way down.
Now, listen to me,
I'm not your enemy...
and I can get you home.
But first you must put
that weapon down and trust me.
Jean-Luc Picard. My name.
That's my name. What's yours?
Lily.
Welcome aboard, Lily.
Thank you.
Maximum setting.
If you'd fired this,
you would've vaporized me.
It's my first ray gun.
There's no glass.
Aah!
Force field.
I've never seen
that kind of technology.
That's because
it hasn't been invented yet.
What?
There's more I have to tell you.
Come on.
Are you ready?
Who are you?
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction.
The Borg have
a collective consciousness.
There are no individuals.
I am the beginning...
the end...
the one who is many.
I am the Borg.
Greetings.
I am curious.
Do you control
the Borg collective?
You imply a disparity
where none exists.
I am the collective.
Perhaps I should
rephrase the question.
I wish to understand...
the organizational
relationships.
Are you their leader?
I bring order to chaos.
An interesting,
if cryptic response.
You are in chaos, Data.
You are the contradiction.
A machine who wishes
to be human.
Since you seem to know
so much about me...
you must be aware that
I am programmed to evolve...
to better myself.
We, too, are
on a quest to better ourselves.
Evolving toward
a state of perfection.
Forgive me, but the Borg
do not evolve, they conquer.
By assimilating other beings
into our collective...
we are bringing them
closer to perfection.
Somehow I question your motives.
That is because
you haven't been properly...
stimulated yet.
You have reactivated
my emotion chip. Why?
Don't be frightened.
I am not frightened.
Do you know
what this is, Data?
It would appear
you are attempting...
to graft organic skin onto
my endo-skeletal structure.
What a cold description
for such a beautiful gift.
Was that good for you?
Ooh.
How many planets
are in this Federation?
Over 150 spread across
8,000 light-years.
You must not get home much.
Actually, I tend
to think of this ship as home.
But if it's Earth
you're talking about...
I try to get back
whenever I can.
Good. They haven't broken
the encryption code yet.
Who, those bionic zombies
you told me about? The-
Borg.
Borg? Sounds Swedish.
How big is this ship?
There are 24 decks.
Almost 700 meters long.
It took me six months
to scrounge enough titanium...
to build a four-meter cockpit.
How much did this thing cost?
The economics
of the future are different.
You see, money doesn't exist
in the 24th century.
No money?
You mean you don't get paid?
The acquisition
of wealth is no longer...
the driving force in our lives.
We work to better ourselves...
and the rest of humanity.
Actually, we're rather like
yourself and Dr. Cochran.
Aah!
All right! All right.
Come on.
Is there another way around?
I know what I'm doing.
Definitely not Swedish.
Aah!
Aah!
What the hell are you doing?
Perhaps something in satin?
And you do understand
we have a strict dress code...
so if you boys
don't leave right now, I'll-
I'm looking for Nicky the Nose.
The Nose?
He hasn't been here in months.
This is the wrong chapter.
Computer, begin chapter 13.
lf I say I love you...
Try to look as if
you're having a good time.
I want you to know...
it's not just because
there's moonlight...
although...
No. Look at me.
Try to act naturally.
There he is.
You're all dressed up...
to go dreamin'.
Now, don't tell me, I know...
Mmm. Ruby.
This is not a good time.
It's never the time
for us, is it, Dix?
Always some excuse,
some case you're working on.
I have talk to Nicky.
I'll see you later.
Watch your caboose
and dump the broad.
lf I say...
I love you...
I want you to know...
Well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.
What's shakin', Dix?
The usual, martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.
Whaa!
No offense.
Ooh!
Aah!
Yaaaah!
-Aah!
-Hey!
I think you got him.
I don't get it.
I thought you said this was all
a bunch of holograms.
I disengaged
the safety protocols.
Without them, even
a holographic bullet can kill.
What are you doing?
I'm looking
for the neuro-processor.
Every Borg has one.
It's like a memory chip.
It will contain a record
of all the instructions...
this Borg has been receiving
from the collective.
Oh, my.
Jean-Luc,
it's one of your uniforms.
Yes. This was Ensign Lynch.
Tough luck, huh?
I've got to get to the bridge.
Go on.
Jeez.
Ffft.
Doctor?
Yeah?
Would you mind taking
a look at this?
Uh, ahem, yeah.
Ahem.
I tried to reconstruct
the intermix chamber...
from what I remember in school.
Tell me if I got it right.
You learned
about this in school?
Basic warp design
is required at the Academy.
The first chapter is called
"Zefram Cochran."
Well,
looks like you got it right.
Commander, this is
what we're thinking of using...
to replace the damaged
warp plasma conduit.
Yeah, Reg,
that's good, but you need...
to reinforce this copper tubing
with a nano-polymer.
Dr. Cochran,
I know this sounds silly...
but can I shake your hand?
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
I can't tell you what an honor
it is to work with you.
I never imagined I'd meet
the inventor of warp drive-
Reg!
I'm sorry. Right.
Thanks.
Do they have to keep doing that?
It's just a little hero worship.
To tell you the truth,
I can't say I blame them.
We all grew up hearing about
what you did here...
or what you're about to do.
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...
but I went to
Zefram Cochran High School.
Really?
You know, I wish I had
a picture of this.
What?
Well, you see, in the future...
this whole area becomes
an historical monument.
You're standing
almost on the exact spot...
where your statue's gonna be.
-Statue?
-Oh, yeah.
It's marble,
about 20 meters tall...
and you're looking up
at the sky...
and your hand's sort of
reaching toward the future.
I gotta take a leak.
Leak?
I'm not detecting any leak.
Don't you people
from the 24th century ever pee?
Oh. Leak.
I get it. That's pretty funny.
Excuse me.
Commander?
-Captain.
-Jean-Luc.
Reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated.
I found something you lost.
I am a Klingon.
Mr. Worf, report.
The Borg control
over half the ship.
We have tried
to restore power...
to the bridge
and weapons systems...
but we have been unsuccessful.
We have another problem.
I've accessed a Borg
neuro-processor...
and I've discovered what
they're trying to do.
They're transforming
the deflector dish...
into an interplexing beacon.
Interplexing?
It's a sub-space transmitter.
If they activate the beacon,
they'll establish a link...
with the Borg living
in this century.
But in the 21st century...
the Borg are still
in the Delta quadrant.
Reinforcements.
Humanity will be an easy target.
Attack the earth in the past
to assimilate the future.
Then we must destroy
the deflector dish...
before they can
activate the beacon.
We can't get to deflector
control or a shuttlecraft-
Mr. Worf, do you remember
your zero-G combat training?
I remember it made me
sick to my stomach.
What are you suggesting?
I think it's time
that we took a little stroll.
Hang on.
There's a humanoid life sign
up ahead. 511 meters.
Cochran?
Mm-hmm.
It's him all right.
I have remodulated
the pulse emitters...
but I do not believe
we will get more...
than one or two shots
before the Borg adapt.
Then we must make
every shot count.
Magnetize.
Watch your caboose, Dix.
I intend to.
How are you doing, Mr. Worf?
Not well, sir.
Try not to look at the stars.
Keep your eyes on the hull.
Let's go.
Tell me, are you using
a polymer-based neuro-relay...
to transit
the organic nerve impulses...
to the central processor
of my positronic net?
If that is the case,
how have you solved...
the problem of increased
signal degradation...
inherent to organo-synthetic
transmission-
Do you always talk this much?
Not always...but often.
Why do you utilize
this primitive communication?
Your android brain
is capable of so much more.
Have you forgotten?
I am endeavoring
to become more human.
Human. We used
to be exactly like them-
flawed, weak, organic.
But we evolved
to include the synthetic.
Now we use both
to attain perfection.
Your goal should be
the same as ours.
Believing oneself
to be perfect...
is often the sign
of a delusional mind.
Small words
from a small being...
trying to attack
what he doesn't understand.
I understand that you have
no real interest in me...
that your goal is to obtain
the encryption codes...
for the Enterprise computer.
That is one of our goals...
one of many...
but in order to reach it...
I'm willing
to help you reach yours.
Aah!
Is it becoming
clear to you yet?
Look at yourself
standing there...
cradling the new flesh
that I've given you.
If it means nothing to you,
why protect it?
l...am simply imitating
the behavior of humans.
You're becoming more human
all the time, Data.
Now you're learning
how to lie.
My programming was not designed
to process these sensations.
Then tear the skin
from your limb...
as you would
a defective circuit.
Go ahead, Data.
We won't stop you.
Do it.
Don't be tempted by flesh.
Are you familiar with
physical forms of pleasure?
If you are...
referring to...
sexuality...
I am fully functional...
programmed in
multiple techniques.
How long has it
been since you've used them?
Eight years...
seven months, sixteen days,
four minutes-
Far too long.
We should bring reinforcements.
There's no time.
It looks as if they're
building the beacon...
right on top
of the particle emitter.
Once all the transponder rods
are in place...
the beacon will be activated.
lf we set
our phasers to full power-
No. There's a risk
that we hit the dish.
It's charged with anti-protons.
We could destroy half the ship.
We have to find another way.
-Doctor?
-Sir?
You still looking
for the bathroom?
I'm not going back.
Look, Doc,
we can't do this without you.
I don't care.
I don't want to be a statue.
-Doctor-
-You stay away from me.
We don't have time for this.
Unh!
You told him about the statue?
For this to work...
all three maglocks
will have to be released.
Magnetic constrictors
are disengaged.
They've adapted.
Warning.
Decompression in 45 seconds.
Hawk!
Aah!
We've had a change of plans,
Data.
Assimilate this.
Only got an hour to go, Doc.
How you feeling?
I got a four-alarm hangover...
either from the whiskey
or your laser beam...
or both...
but I'm ready to make history.
Ha ha ha!
Troi to Commander Riker.
Riker here.
We're ready to open
the launch door.
Go ahead.
Oh.
Look at that.
You don't have
a moon in the 24th century?
Sure we do.
Just looks a lot different.
There are 50 million people
living on the moon in my time.
You can see Tycho City,
New Berlin...
even Lake Armstrong
on a day like this.
Uh-huh.
And you know, Doctor-
Please! Don't tell me
it's all thanks to me.
I've heard enough about
the great Zefram Cochran.
I don't know who writes
your history books...
or where you get
your information from...
but you people got some
pretty funny ideas about me.
You all look at me
as if I'm some kind of...
saint or visionary or something.
I don't think
you're a saint, Doc...
but you did have a vision,
and now we're sitting in it.
You want to know
what my vision is?
Dollar signs. Money.
I didn't build this ship to
usher in a new era for humanity.
You think
I want to go to the stars?
I don't even like to fly.
I take trains.
I built this so I could retire
to some tropical island...
filled with...naked women.
That's Zefram Cochran.
That's his vision.
This other guy
you keep talking about...
this historical figure?
I never met him.
I can't imagine I ever will.
Someone once said,
"Don't try to be a great man.
"Just be a man and let history
make its own judgments."
That's rhetorical nonsense.
Who said that?
You did. 10 years from now.
You got 58 minutes, Doc.
You better
get on that checklist.
They're on the move again.
The Borg just overran three
of our defense checkpoints.
They've taken over
decks five and six.
They've adapted to every
modulation of our weapons.
We have to work on
finding another way...
to modify our weapons
so they'll be more effective.
In the meantime, tell your men
to stand their ground.
Sir-
Fight hand-to-hand
if they have to.
Aye, sir.
Wait. Captain,
our weapons are useless.
We must activate
the auto-destruct sequence...
and use the escape pods
to evacuate the ship.
No!
lf we destroy
the ship, we destroy the Borg.
We're going to stay and fight.
Sir, we have lost
the Enterprise.
We should not sacrifice-
We have not lost
the Enterprise.
We are not going to lose her,
not while I'm in command.
You have your orders.
I must object
to this course of action-
Objection noted.
With all due respect, sir,
I believe you are allowing...
your personal experience
to influence your judgment.
You're afraid.
You want to destroy the ship
and run away. You coward.
Jean-Luc!
If you were any other man, I
would kill you where you stand.
Get off my bridge.
-What do we do now?
-We carry out his orders.
Dyson, Kaplan, start working on
a way to modify the weapons-
This is stupid.
If we can get off this ship
and then blow it up, do it.
Once the captain's made up
his mind, the discussion's over.
Lily!
-You son of a bitch.
-This really isn't the time.
OK. I don't know jack
about the 24th century...
but everybody out there
thinks that staying here...
and fighting the Borg
is suicide.
They're just afraid
to come in here and say it.
The crew is accustomed
to following my orders.
They're probably accustomed
to your orders making sense.
None of them understand
the Borg as I do!
No one does.
No one can.
What is that supposed to mean?
Six years ago...
they assimilated me
into their collective.
They had cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body.
I was linked to the hive mind...
every trace
of individuality erased.
I was one of them.
So you can imagine, my dear...
I have a somewhat unique
perspective on the Borg...
and I know how to fight them.
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have work to do.
I am such an idiot.
It's so simple.
The Borg hurt you...
and now you're going
to hurt them back.
In my century,
we don't succumb to revenge.
We have a more evolved
sensibility.
Bullshit!
I saw the look on your face...
when you shot those Borg
on the holodeck.
You were almost enjoying it.
How dare you?
Come on, Captain.
You're not the first man...
to get a thrill
from murdering someone.
-I see it all the time.
-Get out!
Or what? You'll kill me
like you killed Ensign Lynch?
-There was no way to save him.
-You didn't even try!
Where was your evolved
sensibility then?
I don't have time for this.
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt
your little quest.
Captain Ahab
has to go hunt his whale.
What?
You do have books
in the 24th century?
-This is not about revenge.
-Liar!
This is about saving
the future of humanity!
Jean-Luc, blow up the damn ship!
No!
No!
I will not sacrifice
the Enterprise.
We've made too many compromises,
too many retreats.
They invade our space,
and we fall back.
They assimilate entire worlds,
and we fall back.
Not again.
The line must be drawn here!
This far, no farther!
And I will make them pay
for what they've done!
You broke your little ships.
See you around, Ahab.
"And he piled upon
the whale's white hump...
"the sum of
all the rage and hate...
"felt by his whole race."
"If his chest
had been a cannon...
"he would have shot
his heart upon it."
What?
Moby Dick.
Actually, I never read it.
Ahab spent years...
hunting the white whale
that crippled him.
Quest for vengeance.
But in the end...
it destroyed him and his ship.
I guess he didn't know
when to quit.
Prepare to evacuate
the Enterprise.
A.T.R. setting?
Active.
Main bus?
Ready.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Begin auto-destruct sequence...
authorization
Picard-four-seven-alpha-tango.
Computer,
Commander Beverly Crusher.
Confirm auto-destruct

Crusher-two-two-beta-Charlie.
Computer,

Confirm auto-destruct sequence.
Authorization
Worf-three-seven-gamma-echo.
Command authorization accepted.
Awaiting final code to begin
auto-destruct sequence.
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
Destruct sequence alpha-one,
15 minutes, silent countdown.
Enable.
Self-destruct in 15 minutes.
There will be no further
audio warnings.
So much for the Enterprise E.
We barely knew her.
You think
they'll build another one?
Plenty of letters left
in the alphabet.
Mr. Worf.
I regret some of the things
I said to you earlier.
Some?
As a matter of fact...
I think you're the bravest man
I have ever known.
Thank you, sir.
See you on Gravett Island.
Captain.
Data.
Control to Phoenix.
Final launch-sequence
checks are complete.
Good luck.
Everybody ready
to make some history?
Always am.
I think I forgot something.
-What?
-I don't know.
It's probably nothing.
Begin ignition sequence.
Oh, God! Now I remember.
-What?
-Where is it?
We can't lift off without it.
Geordi, we've got to abort.
No! No, wait! I found it.
Twelve, eleven...
ten...nine...
eight...
Let's rock 'n' roll!
You don't know what...
we can find.
Why don't you come
with me, little girl...
on a magic carpet ride?
You don't know what...
we can see.
Why don't you tell
your dreams to me?
Could you
turn that down a little?
Close your eyes-
We've got a red light
on the second intake valve.
Ignore it. We'll be fine.
Prepare first-stage shutdown
and separation on my mark.
Three...
two...
one...
mark.
OK, let's bring
the warp core on-line.
Oh, wow.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
lf you see
any of my crew, give them this.
What is it?
Orders to find a quiet
corner of North America...
and stay out of history's way.
Well, good luck.
To both of us.
You're not leaving, are you?
Lily, when I was held captive
on the Borg ship...
my crew risked everything
to save me.
There is...
someone still on this ship...
and I owe him the same.
Go and find your friend.
What's wrong, Locutus?
Isn't this familiar?
Organic minds are
such fragile things.
How could you
forget me so quickly?
We were very close, you and l.
You can still hear our song.
Yes, l...
I remember you.
You were there all the time.
But that ship...
and all the Borg on it
were destroyed.
You think in such
three-dimensional terms.
How small you've become.
Data understands me.
Don't you, Data?
What have you done to him?
Given him what he always
wanted-flesh and blood.
Let him go.
He's not the one you want.
Are you offering yourself to us?
Offering myself?
That's it.
I remember now.
It wasn't enough
that you assimilate me.
I had to give myself
freely to the Borg.
To you.
You flatter yourself.
I've overseen the assimilation
of countless millions.
-You were no different.
-You're lying.
You wanted more than
just another Borg drone.
You wanted a human being
with a mind of his own...
who could bridge the gulf
between humanity and the Borg.
You wanted a counterpart,
but I resisted.
I fought you.
You can't begin to imagine
the life you denied yourself.
It's not too late.
Locutus
could still be with you...
just in the way you wanted-
an equal.
Let Data go...
and I will take my place
at your side...
willingly
without any resistance.
Such a noble creature...
a quality we sometimes lack.
We will add your distinctiveness
to our own.
Welcome home...Locutus.
Data, you are free to go.
Data, go.
No.
I do not wish to go.
As you can see,
I have already found an equal.
Data, deactivate
the self-destruct sequence.
Data, no. Don't do it.
Data, listen to me.
Auto-destruct
sequence deactivated.
Now, enter the encryption codes
and give me computer control.
Data!
Data...
He will make an excellent drone.
Plasma injectors are on-line.
Everything's looking good.
I think we're ready.
They should be out there
right now.
We better break the warp barrier
in the next five minutes...
if we're gonna get
their attention.
Nacelles are charged and ready.
Let's do it!
Engage.
Warp field is looking good.
Structural integrity is holding.
Speed-
20,000 kilometers per second.
Sweet Jesus!
Relax, Doctor. I'm sure they're
just here to give us a sendoff.
I am bringing
the external sensors on-line.
30 seconds to warp threshold.
Approaching light speed.
We're at critical velocity.
Quantum torpedoes locked.
Destroy them.
Watch your future's end.
Data!
Resistance is futile.
Aah!
Whoa!
Aah!
Aah!
That should be enough.
Throttle back.
Take us out of warp.
Is that Earth?
That's it.
It's so small.
It's about to get
a whole lot bigger.
Captain.
Data.
Are you all right?
I would imagine
I look worse than l-
feel.
Strange.
Part of me is sorry
she is dead.
She was unique.
She brought me
closer to humanity...
than I ever thought possible...
and for a time...
I was tempted by her offer.
How long a time?
Zero point six eight
seconds, sir.
For an android,
that is nearly an eternity.
Captain's log, April 5, 2063.
Captain's log, April 5, 2063.
The voyage of the Phoenix
was a success...again.
The alien ship
detected the warp signature...
and is on its way
to rendezvous with history.
My God...they're
really from another world.
And they'll want to meet
the man who flew that warp ship.
Live long and prosper.
Thanks.
I think it's time
we made a discreet exit.
Riker to Enterprise,
stand by to beam us up.
You gotta go?
I envy you...
the world you're going to.
I envy you...
taking these first steps
into a new frontier.
I shall miss you, Lily.
Picard to Enterprise, energize.
Report.
The moon's
gravitational field...
obscured our warp signature.
The Vulcans did not detect us.
I've reconfigured
our warp field...
to match the chronometric
readings of the Borg sphere.
Recreate the vortex,
Commander.
All decks report ready.
Helm standing by.
Mr. Data, lay in
a course for the 24th century.
I suspect our future is there
waiting for us.
Course laid in, sir.
Make it so.
No, no. It's music.
I'll play you some.
Ooby dooby...
No, no...
Ooby dooby...
You dance to it.
Ooby dooby dooby dooby...
Dooby dooby
doo-wah doo-wah doo-wah...
Well, you wiggle to the left...
You wiggle to the right...
Do the ooby dooby
with all your might...
Ooby dooby...
