- Nice!
- An ideaI famiIy portrait...
Look into the camera, pIease.
Great!
How about giving us a smile?
Let's see some happy faces.
You too, Mother... Great!
Mind your hair! There we have it.
- That should do it, right?
- Yes, l think so.
- We've finished with the girls.
- You've been so good!
- Bye-bye!
- They were good as gold...
How about some shots
of the parents on the sofa?
Lean forward, you're sliding
too far back. That's it!
- l'll try and make myself small.
- Talk to each other.
Marianne, turn your eyes
slightly towards us...
Look as if you were fond
of each other... There, like that.
Hold that pose! Great....
- That's it. Thank you very much.
- Good!
We'll need some portraits later.
Well then, let's start, shall we?
l always begin with a standard
question, to soothe the nerves.
- l'm not particularly nervous.
- Good. The question is:
How would you describe
yourselves in a few words?
- That's not an easy one.
- Not all that difficult, surely?
- l may be misunderstood.
- Really?
lt may sound conceited to say
l'm highly intelligent, youthful,
successful, sensible, sexy and
l care about the world we live in.
l'm educated, well-read
and a good mixer. Let's see...
l'm a good friend even to people
who are worse off than myself.
l'm good at sports.
l'm a good husband and a good son.
l have no debts and l pay my taxes.
l respect our government,
no matter what it does.
l love our royal family.
l've left the state church.
- Shall l go on?
- Please.
- l'm a splendid lover.
- Perhaps we can skip that question.
What about you, Marianne?
Well, what shall l say?
l'm married to Johan
and l have two daughters...
- That's all l can think of...
- Come on, think harder.
- l think Johan is awfully nice...
- How kind of you.
- We've been married for 10 years.
- We've just renewed our contract.
Unlike Johan, l lack the ability
to see myself in such glowing terms,
but in all honesty, l'm glad
l'm able to lead the life l do.
lt's a good life,
if you know what l mean.
What else? My, this is difficult...
- She has a nice figure.
- l'm trying to be serious.
- l have two girls, Karin and Eva.
- You've already said that.
How about some personal data?
Let's start with your ages.
- l'm 42, but l don't look it.
- l'm 35.
Both of us come from
obscenely middle-class homes.
- Johan's father is a doctor.
- And my mother is the motherly type.
My father is a lawyer.
lt was decided from the outset
that l was to be a lawyer too.
l'm the youngest of seven children.
Mother ran a big household.
- Nowadays, she takes it easy.
- Oh, does she?
Oddly enough, we get on with our
parents. We see a lot of each other.
There's never been
any friction to speak of.
Let's talk about your professions.
Mine is a bit unusual.
l'm an associate professor
at the lnstitute of Psychotechnology.
Family law is my specialty. l belong
to a large firm of solicitors.
Most of my work concerns divorce,
but the interesting thing is...
Hold that pose!
Take a picture, l want
to capture that expression. Good!
- My, l feel so...
- lt will pass.
- Tell me, how did you meet?
- l'll leave that to Johan.
- Lord, that is interesting!
- lt wasn't love at first sight.
We both had a large circle of friends
and ran into each other often.
We were also both involved
in politics for several years
and we went in for amateur
dramatics quite a lot as students.
Well, l can't say we made any
deeper impression on each other.
Marianne thought l was stuck-up.
Johan had a rather highly publicized
affair with a pop singer...
..which gave him a certain image
and made him insufferable.
Marianne was 19.
She was married to a fool whose
only saving grace was a rich father.
He was very kind
and l was madly in love with him.
Besides, l got pregnant
early on in the relationship.
- But how was it that...
- That the two of us joined forces?
That was actually Marianne's idea.
My baby died soon after birth
and my husband and l divorced,
to our mutual relief.
And Johan's singer
had given him his walking papers.
We were both a bit hurt and lonely,
so l suggested making a go of it.
We weren't in love at all,
but we were both downhearted.
And then we found out
that we got along very well
and we really
buckled down to our studies.
We moved in together, a situation
our mothers actually took in their stride.
ln fact, they became good friends.
We were accepted
as Johan and Marianne.
After six months we got married.
- By then we were in love as well.
- Very much so!
- We were seen as an ideal couple.
- And that's still the case.
- No complications?
- We've never had material worries.
We're on good terms with friends
and relations on both sides.
We have good jobs that we enjoy.
We're healthy.
And so on, to an almost vulgar
degree. Security, order, loyalty...
We're almost indecently lucky.
Naturally, we have our differences,
just like other people.
But we agree on all the key issues.
- Don't you ever quarrel?
- Marianne does.
Johan is very slow to anger,
so l run out of steam.
This all sounds wonderful. All of it.
Only last night someone was saying
that the very lack of problems
is a serious problem.
We are well aware that
a life like ours can be dangerous.
How do you mean, dangerous?
The world is going to hell. l claim
the right to mind my own business.
Live and let live, that's my motto.
lt sickens me
to hear about the latest panacea.
- l don't agree with Johan.
- So, what's your opinion?
- l believe in compassion.
- Please elaborate on that.
lf people learned to care
about each other in childhood,
the world
would be a different place.
Hold that pose!
Look into the camera, please.
Listen to this:
''''''Marianne's eyes, blue as an old
folk song, are lit up from within.''
When asked how she copes
with a job and a household,
she smiles with shy delight
''and replies that she and Johan
help each other.'''' That's true.''
''''''We understand each other,
she says,''
brightening as Johan sits down
beside her on their heirloom sofa.
''He puts a protective arm around her
and she snuggles up to him.''''''
- Hey!
- This is the best bit!
''''''So l leave, noticing that they
seem pleased at the prospect''
that they can once more
be alone together.
Two people who have matured:
strong, happy and positive.
''People who have never forgotten
to give love pride of place''''.''
- We almost died when we read it.
- l was going to file a complaint.
But our mothers and our daughters
simply loved the article.
What really riles me is that
it says nothing about my eyes.
- lsn't there a secret glow in them?
- They're more like dark pools.
- Very sexy, actually.
- Katarina has a crush on you.
- Johan, will you elope with me?
- A change would do Johan good.
He's been so good for 10 years
and has never been unfaithful.
Are you sure?
l believe everything Johan says.
- Did you hear that, Katarina?
- Johan is a better liar than you.
- But l have no imagination.
- That's just it.
- lt makes you a better liar.
- Peter tarts up his stories.
At times l really find it touching.
l read your article in TechnicaI Times.
Even l could understand it.
- Actually, Katarina wrote it.
- Are you that clever?
You see, l was in Germany and
they wanted an article on the spot.
So Katarina wrote it
and read it to me on the phone.
- But why did it have your by-line?
- lt's not discrimination.
- We collaborate.
- That's admirable.
You wouldn't say that
if you knew the details.
Things are rotten between us.
Cheers, Katarina, my poppet!
Cheers...
Does it bother you that l speak
freely to Johan and Marianne?
- What is it, Katarina?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
Only Peter can be
so damn clumsy sometimes.
Clumsy is the right word...
l take pride in being clumsy...
and imaginative.
The funny thing
is that according to Katarina,
l am nothing
but a spineless jellyfish.
- Jellyfish? Now you're talking.
- Let's try to enjoy ourselves now.
Exactly, because we mustn't forget...
l'm making a thank-you speech now.
Bearing in mind
that fabulous magazine article
reminding us
that we are in a happy home
that we must not soil
with emotional rubbish.
Cheers, Marianne!
l may not envy your domestic bliss...
..but l envy
your talent as a cook.
No, l really mean that.
l wish Katarina
would learn to cook like that.
Katarina is a much better cook.
- Peter says l poison the food.
- lt's a standing joke in our house.
- Right, it's obviously a joke.
- One that's seen better days.
Well, let's go into
the drawing room and have coffee.
Well, Johan, what am l to do?
l've put my foot in it again.
The girls will clear the table.
- lt's all too bloody touching.
- What is?
Your marriage.
Johan and Marianne...
lt can move a person to tears.
ln fact, it makes you want to stick
a pin into your beautiful balloon.
- So would you?
- Cheers to you both!
- lt's been 10 years, right?
- We just had our 10th anniversary.
- No skeletons in the cupboard?
- You never know.
- Both Johan and l like tidying up.
- You hear that, Katarina?
That's where you and l have been
remiss... We never clean things up.
But next week l'll call Marianne
and make an appointment,
so she can get started
on our divorce.
Peter will have changed his mind
by the time he's sober.
That's when the calculator
starts running.
''This is what he says:
''''l'll agree to a divorce,''
''if Katarina gives up her claim
to our assets in Switzerland.''''''
''And my reply is:
''''But it's my money, l've earned it.''''''
Then Peter
will say he has multiplied it
and l can have the whole factory.
Then l say, that's nice of you
to let me have a factory in ltaly -
that gets more risky
with every rise in labour costs.
''- But Katarina, l've said...
- ''''Take the whole set-up in Sweden.''
The apartment, the country house,
the boat, the car,
''the shares and the premium
bonds.'''' lsn't that nice?''
l get all the taxable stuff!
Excuse me for going on
about such trivial matters,
but when Peter gets started on
assets, l know how drunk he is.
- And the insults aren't far off.
- That's what l've said all along.
Katarina is a businessman,
with equal stress on both words.
A businessman...
ln addition to which,
she's a brilliant artist
and she has
an lQ of l don't know what.
She's attractive as well.
She's a paragon,
and gift-wrapped to boot.
How l ever got lucky with that
monster of perfection is a mystery.
l really think we'll ring for a taxi
and go home now.
This can't be pleasant
for Johan and Marianne...
No... Johan and Marianne?
They're candy figurines
decorated with red ribbons.
Just like the marzipan pigs
of our childhood.
lt's good for their moral fibre,
to gaze
into the bottomless pits of hell.
August Strindberg
once wrote:
''''''ls there anything more fearsome''
''than a husband and wife
who hate each other?''''''
What do you say?
Maybe child abuse is even worse.
But then Katarina and l are children.
Deep down, Katarina
is a little girl who is crying
because she has fallen down
and no one comforts her.
And l haven't grown up either.
l cry
because Katarina can't love me,
in spite of my bad behaviour.
There's one thing to be grateful for.
That there is nothing
more hellish than this.
That's why we're ready for a divorce.
Provided you listen to reason.
Provided we simultaneously,
in each other's presence
and in front of reliable witnesses,
sign all the papers.
So no one can stiff the other.
- We'll call you up this week.
- We have a great business lawyer.
Borglund can help you
with the financial arrangements.
What do you say?
Even if we agree on money matters,
you'll never let me go.
l'm convinced of that.
You think you're that bloody
indispensable, my dear Katarina?
Whatever gave you that idea?
Do tell me... Tell us.
You force me to have sex,
since you can't get it up
with other women.
Your need of a guilty conscience
knows no bounds.
Now that it's all over with Jan
l expect you're in a panic.
You're stuck with old Peter.
He has the right patience.
So you think
you're the only one, do you?
How touching...
You think there are no others.
Let me tell you one thing, Peter...
Please excuse me
if l'm rather outspoken,
but Peter is asking for it
and he needs to be enlightened.
l'll tell you this, Peter...
You nauseate me so much...
..in a physical sense...
that l'd buy myself a lay just
to wash you out of my sex organs.
''''''Abide with me,
fast falls the eventide''
''The darkness deepens,
Lord with me abide...''''''
You son of a bitch!
''''''When other helpers fail
and comforts flee''
''Help of the helpless,
Oh, abide with me.''''''
Whatever
that's supposed to mean...
l hope there won't
be any stains on the carpet.
l don't know about liqueur...
Why don't you bill me?
Do as l say!
Would you mind
pouring me a cup of coffee?
l'm pretty sloshed.
Forgive us.
We don't usually behave like this.
But you're our best friends.
You're our only friends.
Forgive me... Forgive us.
lf you ring for a cab,
l'll take my bacchante home
and we'll finish our little scene.
The finale is usually
not suitable for an audience.
- What's the time?
- Ten past twelve.
- Thank goodness we got rid of them.
- Yes, things got a bit out of hand.
Do you believe it's possible
for a couple to be partners for life?
lt's an absurd convention.
Marriage should
be a five-year contract.
- Or be subject to annual renewal.
- What about us?
No, we're the exception
that proves the rule.
- So you think we'll stay together?
- What a funny question.
Are you ever sorry
you can't sleep with anyone else?
- No, are you?
- At times.
- Well, l'll be damned!
- lt's a purely theoretical longing.
l wonder if there's something wrong
with me, l never feel like that.
- l'm content.
- So am l. Now l've got it!
Katarina and Peter go through hell
because they don't communicate.
They have to translate everything
they mean into a common language.
- l think it's simpler than that.
- We understand each other instantly.
We speak the same language,
that's why we're doing fine.
l think it's the money.
lf you speak the same language,
money is not an issue.
- You and your languages.
- l see it all the time at work.
Sometimes it's as if the couple
are talking on bad telephone lines.
Sometimes it's like listening to
two pre-programmed tape recorders
and sometimes it's
the utter silence of outer space.
- l don't know which is the worst.
- l don't know...
Supposing the kids went to day care
while we worked shifts at a factory?
- lt wouldn't matter.
- l think it would.
lf you speak the same language,
it doesn't matter where you are.
That's a romantic view.
Do you think our relationship would
suffer if we lived that kind of life?
- Yes, l do. Seriously.
- lt would diminish our relationship?
''Regardless of our ''''language''''.''
lsn't the danger of estrangement
just as great in the life we lead?
Definitely not.
Hard, tedious labour exposes
people to much greater strain.
You're sillier than l thought
and you're taking the romantic view.
- We'll see.
- What? What will we see?
- l don't know, do you?
- Are you teasing me?
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes, terribly.
How about
some beer and sandwiches?
Sounds marvellous.
THE ART OF SWEEPlNG MATTERS
UNDER THE RUG
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- Like a log and you?
Well, l woke up at 5 o'clock
and couldn't get back to sleep again.
- Why not?
- l got all worked up.
- Should l feel guilty?
- No.
For once you're not to blame, dear.
l lay fuming about
that wretched Sunday dinner.
We always have Sunday dinner
with your parents or mine.
- lt's absurd.
- lt's for their sake.
- l'm going to cancel dinner.
- Cancel it?
- What will your mother say?
- Whatever she damned well likes.
l want to spend Sunday
with you and the kids.
- Well, if you can swing that...!
- l certainly can!
l'm fed up...
- ls it the curse?
- You always say that!
Even if my period's due on Monday,
that may not be why l'm edgy.
- What's wrong?
- Has it ever struck you
that our life is mapped out and
every last second is accounted for?
- But we have our vacations.
- They're even more scheduled.
- Aren't you going to wake the girls?
- They're sleeping in today.
Karin has the day off from school
and Eva has a sore throat.
She needs to come along on Sunday
to spare us from nagging!
- You were going to cancel dinner.
- l'd rather you did it.
Oh no, l'm not making
excuses to your mother!
Aren't you going to call your mother?
She's an early bird.
- Didn't we agree you would call?
- No, dear.
l'll hold your hand in moral support.
All right, l'll do it...
- My, my heart's pounding!
- The first sign of the great revolt.
No answer? What a relief!
Hello. Miss Alm? ls my mother in?
May l have a word with her?
How is your knee, by the way?
Oh, it's not any better?
lt's worse? That's too bad...
What does the doctor say?
He's not sympathetic, you say?
lt's a sign of the times.
Hello, Mother. How are you?
Now isn't that nice.
Has Dad left yet?
Right, he was going to the country.
So you let him go off
on his own like that?
Oh, Erik is with him. That's good.
l'm sorry, but there's
something l have to tell you...
Exactly, how did you guess?
What reasons do we have?
l simply want to spend Sunday
with Johan and the girls.
No, we're not going anywhere.
We just don't
want to come over for dinner.
l don't think for a moment that dad
was looking forward to Sunday.
lt should be a pleasure
and not a duty, right?
Yes, l see. l see.
You hadn't told me that bit of news.
Bored stiff, to be quite honest.
No, forget all about it, Mother.
We'll be there.
Yes, we'll manage. lt's fine.
We're looking forward to it.
Bye for now, Mother dear.
The revolution
was smothered at birth.
Aunt Elsa is coming
and she was so
looking forward to seeing us.
- She has a present for you.
- And Mrs Danielsson is cooking.
- And your dad longed to see us.
- Damnation!
l admire your courage all the same.
We'll say no another time.
Don't be upset.
- Will you be home for dinner?
- No, meet me at the theatre.
Don't you like
coming home any more?
My, aren't we in a fine mood today?
l'd love to stay in bed for a week,
so we could just hold each other.
- And we'd both have a good cry.
- That's not the life we chose.
lf only l could be sure
we chose it and not our mothers.
You're suffering from
a maternal persecution complex.
- Did you want a life like this?
- No.
What if we started
cheating on each other?
What would you do then?
Kill you, of course.
- Sometimes l wish...
- What?
Nothing...
- Wait a second, l'll come with you.
- Why not take your own car?
We can go home together
after the play.
- What about the girls?
- l'll ask Miss Andersson to cook.
She makes fabulous pancakes.
l'll go wake the girls.
- But l'm in a hurry.
- lt'll only take a minute.
While l remember it,
please pay your parking tickets.
- There's a whole pile here.
- Yes, sir.
l'll see you tonight at the theatre.
Hello? Yes, speaking.
Hello, Mother. The line is bad,
l didn't recognise your voice.
l'm fine, how are you?
You're worried. Now, why is that?
Marianne's mother called
and she's worried as well, you say.
Good Lord...
No, Marianne and l are doing fine.
We're healthy and cheerful
and ecstatically happy.
Nothing's wrong, l swear!
Don't worry, Mother dear.
Your intuition? lt's led you astray.
Marianne and l are happier than ever.
Tell Marianne's mother
that you should do something
more constructive than gossip.
l'm pressed for time, Mother dear.
Yes, l'll see you soon.
We'll pop in on Friday, just like
we said. Say hello to dad.
Hell and damnation!
Am l disturbing you?
l just had to see what you're up to.
A lot of rumours are floating around.
What is all this mysterious stuff?
- Shouldn't you be in Lund?
- That's right.
However the students are demonstrating.
The lectures were cancelled.
- What's this going to be?
- Take a look.
- What am l supposed to do?
- Hold this pen.
When l put the lights out
you'll see a bright dot on the wall.
Try and touch it with the pen.
lf you miss, draw a line to it.
The TV camera
will register your efforts.
- But it's dark.
- There's infra light.
l'll watch on the monitor outside.
l'll put the lights out now.
Off you go.
Get to it.
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No, please continue.
But... lt keeps moving.
lt's not a trick, it's quite still.
l've had enough of this.
Turn the lights on.
Well, aren't you cross?
- That was unpleasant...
- Yes, it makes people nervous.
Look how you've wandered,
getting more and more irritated.
- What does that prove?
- That remains to be seen.
- l'd like a cigarette.
- Sure. Have a seat.
l gave up smoking six days ago.
lt's awful.
- Having withdrawal symptoms?
- Stefan is away...
My friends avoid me,
but l'll try and stick it out.
Go on, have one.
That spy Bromeus left some here.
Oh, that's heaven!
- Lord, what bliss!
- Well?
Right...
l spent the day reading
your poems yesterday. Very carefully.
- They baffled me.
- Were they so strange?
That's not it.
Well, l might be wrong...
- Has Marianne read them?
- No, she's not interested in poetry.
- She ought to be interested in you.
- She is, but not in that way.
Really?
You and l are old friends.
We've never been sexually involved.
You can provide an objective opinion
before l try the publishers.
- l shouldn't bother.
- Are they that bad?
lt's not that they're bad...
..if only that was the case.
You mean they're mediocre?
They're insipid, neat, and puerile?
That l'm indulging
in spiritual masturbation?
Several of us in our set believed
you were destined for greatness.
We admired you.
You left us all behind.
We even envied you.
- Does that affect my poetry?
- No.
- You read it while craving nicotine.
- That's true...
l intend to show them around.
Naturally...
l'll wait until
some publishers tell me they're bad.
- You feel offended.
- You bet l do!
l'm sorry.
Well, l know
someone who likes them...
- Who would that be?
- Curious, are you?
My dear little Johan...
Pay no attention to what l said.
lt was just my craving talking.
Well, l must go.
l'll leave the poems at your door.
Give my love to Marianne.
l'll stick to you
through thick and thin.
Bye!
l'll see you around 12:30, then. Bye.
l'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
During this first encounter,
we customarily establish the problem.
l want a divorce.
- How long have you been married?
- More than 20 years.
- Do you have a profession?
- No, l'm a housewife.
Why do you want a divorce?
lt's a loveless marriage.
- ls that your reason?
- Yes.
- Has it always been like this?
- Yes, for the full 20 years.
But now you want to break away.
Yes.
My husband is a responsible man.
He's kind and conscientious.
He's been an excellent father.
We've never quarrelled.
We have a nice apartment
and a house in the country.
We're both fond of music.
We belong
to a chamber music society.
- lt all sounds ideal.
- Yes, doesn't it?
But there's no love between us,
there never has been.
Forgive me for asking,
but have you met someone?
No, l haven't.
What about your husband?
Not as far as l know.
Won't it be lonely for you?
l guess so...
But that's better
than living in a loveless marriage.
Have you informed
your husband of this?
Naturally.
15 years ago, l told him
l didn't want to live with him.
He asked me to wait
until the children had grown up.
Now that they've left home,
l can get my divorce.
And what does he say?
He keeps asking me
what is wrong with our marriage.
l tell him l can't go on
in a relationship that lacks love.
Then he asks what this love
is supposed to consist of.
But l can't describe
something that doesn't exist.
Have you been on good terms
with your children?
l've never loved my children.
l know that now...
l used to think l did. People do.
But l know now
that l never loved them.
l've been a good mother
to them all the same.
l've done all l could, even though
l've never felt anything for them.
l know just what you're thinking:
''''''She's been overindulged
and has no sense of humour.''
She has all she could ever want,
but still she moans about love.
There are other qualities:
''friendship, loyalty, security...''''''
Something like that, yes.
Let me tell you something.
l have a mental image of myself,
which doesn't correspond
to reality.
Forgive a personal question...
lsn't it so that love...
What were you going to ask?
l'm not sure. Forgive me.
l have the capacity to love.
But it's all been... bottled up.
The life l've led
has stifled my potential.
The time has come to change that.
The first step is divorce.
My husband and l
block each other
in some deadly way.
That sounds frightening.
lt is frightening.
Something peculiar is happening.
My senses, sight, hearing, touch
are starting to fail me.
This table, for instance,
l can see it and touch it...
But the sensation
is diminished and dry.
Do you understand?
l think l do.
lt's the same with everything -
music, scents, faces and voices.
Everything seems...
puny, grey and undignified.
Now for a drink and some food.
Sitting through lbsen
on an empty stomach is deadly.
Remember when we joined
the May Day procession?
You were
the more fervent believer.
You told me l neglected our home.
That was the winter, we all
came down with the Asian flu.
- We believed in the future then.
- lt's nice to believe in something.
And we had the pleasure
of annoying our parents.
- You were a hothead.
- So was your dad.
A pretty hothead. You were
very attractive as a socialist.
Aren't l now? Very attractive?
But married people
lose interest in each other.
We haven't.
We're just too busy. When evening
comes around, we're exhausted.
That wasn't a reproach, l promise.
- We like each other.
- Not in that way.
- Oh yes, we do.
- Our life is full of evasions.
l can't help not enjoying it
as much as l used to.
There's a natural explanation.
You shouldn't reproach me.
- Don't get upset.
- We have a fine sex life.
We're not as passionate nowadays,
but it could be worse.
Sex isn't everything.
lf you're not satisfied
you'd better find a mistress
who is more exciting sexually.
- l assure you, l do my best!
- Right...
You've got that look again.
Tell me what you're brooding about.
- You'll only get angry.
- No, l'm listening.
Why make sex so complicated?
lt's pretty elementary stuff.
lt's become such a sore spot.
lt's all your mother's fault.
- You're so superficial.
- You're a sourpuss!
You put all the blame on me.
- You said you do your best.
- l do!
That's preposterous!
Are you calling me a liar?
Then what are you talking about?
Let's drop this and go to bed.
lt's just like you
to get me so worked up
and then yawn and say it's bedtime.
You suffer from ferocious ambition.
lt's something we often joke about,
but can't
our poor sex life be spared?
Why won't you leave me alone?
First you attack me for not trying
and later for making the effort.
Now look what l've done!
Yes, indeed, you have.
Couldn't you be kind instead?
There, there... Don't be upset.
l'm sorry.
lt's possible to talk too much
about these matters, you know.
l know you shouldn't keep secrets,
but in this case the rule is wrong.
There are some things
you shouldn't pry into.
We hurt each other to no end
and the barbs still remain
when we go to bed.
lt's like lying on a bed of nails.
- What are you laughing at?
- The bed of nails.
- lt's all very well to laugh.
- Let's go to bed.
You've been unbelievably tactless.
l apologise.
Don't l give you enough affection?
Affection takes time.
- Then you don't get enough.
- We don't, or give enough either.
That's why l wanted us
to go away this summer.
Affection shouldn't
be kept for vacations.
You're nice,
even if you are a moron.
Lucky l'm married to you.
You're mediocre, but you have
your moments of greatness.
At our age, thousands
of brain cells burn out every day.
- Never to be replaced...
- You must lose a million!
You're awfully sweet anyway,
even if you do scold and fuss.
l'm nearly asleep already.
- l'll just go check on the children.
- l'm nearly asleep, so don't worry.
Aren't you going to set the alarm?
You may make love to me
now if you like.
Thanks for the offer,
but l'm too tired.
Here already? l wasn't
expecting you until tomorrow.
What a lovely surprise!
Are you hungry?
We all went to bed early.
We thought we'd have an early night.
The girls and l have been dieting.
- Would you like some sandwiches?
- Sounds good to me.
Or shall l fry you some eggs
and ham, or fix some soup?
No, sandwiches
and beer will do fine.
By the way, Peter and Katarina
will call you on Monday.
What an ordeal they're having!
They don't seem able
to decide about their divorce.
l told them to get a lawyer each,
but they won't.
Listen, change into your pyjamas
and l'll bring in a tray.
Sounds nice...
l was afraid you were angry with me.
- Why should l be?
- l was beastly on the phone.
l called back,
but you'd pulled out the plug.
l was tired last night.
l'd been with
that numbskull from the ministry.
Those bureaucratic idiots
in charge of our well-being...
- l still think l behaved badly.
- Let's drop the subject.
You never want
to finish talking about anything,
but this won't take long, dear.
l just wanted to say
that you were right, but so am l.
lf you don't want to wear a tuxedo,
that's your business.
- But l've a right to my own opinion.
- l hate wearing a tux.
lt's a ridiculous outfit.
l feel like a dressed-up chimp.
Let's not start quarrelling.
Tux or no tux, l love you.
A tuxedo is hardly
essential to our marriage.
- lt seemed like that last night.
- l said l was wrong.
Watching you eat
makes me hungry...
l need a sandwich.
l'm so hungry, l feel light-headed.
l've lost nearly two kilos this week.
Does it show?
l can feel it, though.
But it seems pointless at times...
Why should we grudge ourselves
the good things in life?
Why can't we be fat and cheerful?
Remember
Aunt Miriam and Uncle David?
They were big, fat and cheerful.
They slept in that double bed
of theirs, holding hands.
Content with each other
the way they were.
Why can't we be like them,
brimming with contentment?
What's the matter?
Are you upset?
Has something happened?
What's wrong?
Tell me.
l came here to tell you something.
l've gone and fallen in love.
lt's quite absurd
and probably all wrong...
l met her at that congress in June.
She was an interpreter.
She's a student of Slavic languages.
She's nothing much to look at.
You might even think she's ugly.
l've no idea what this will lead to.
l don't know a thing. l'm bewildered.
On some level l'm happy,
but l have one hell of a guilty
conscience about you and the girls.
We've always got along so well.
Things have been
no better or no worse
than in most families.
Say something, for Christ's sake.
l don't know what to say.
lt was wrong not to tell you sooner,
but l figured l'd get over it.
l didn't want to worry you.
lt's funny...
..that l haven't noticed anything.
Everything's been like usual.
Better, in fact.
You've been so sweet.
l've been a silly blind fool.
l didn't understand...
- How mortifying.
- No, you haven't understood a thing.
You've never been
particularly observant.
- Where do we go from here?
- l don't know.
Do you want a divorce?
Are you going to marry her?
Why tell me now? What's the rush?
We're leaving for Paris tomorrow.
l want to get away from it all.
l was going this autumn anyway.
Paula has this scholarship...
..and l want to be with her.
l can't make it without her.
So we're leaving tomorrow.
Now that l'm talking to you,
l want to ditch the whole damn thing.
l feel tired and scared.
Nothing could be more ridiculous.
l know just what you're thinking.
How could you know that?
l'm trying not to feel guilty,
which has rather affected me.
Facts are facts,
there's nothing to be done.
Let's go to bed. l expect
you need to make an early start.
l have a meeting at nine.
Then we should get some sleep.
Aren't you going to undress?
You have marks on your chest.
How tactless of you.
ls my grey suit here or in town?
- lt's at the cleaners.
- What a shame.
Did you want to bring it along?
Can't you go and pick it up?
l won't have the time.
l'm busy right up to 3 o'clock.
l can pick it up for you.
l'll do your packing, too.
You're no good at such things.
- No, thank you.
- Don't be silly...
l'm a bit conventional.
l think you have all you need here.
There are clean shirts
and underwear.
Why don't you travel
in your jacket and flannels?
- They give you a youthful air.
- Whatever you say...
- How long will you be away?
- lt depends.
What do you mean?
l've taken leave of absence
for at least six months.
l'll probably stay away for
at least seven or eight months.
l want to make a clean break.
- And if l'm not here?
- l couldn't care less.
Do you know how long
l've wanted to leave?
How long
l've thought about leaving you?
- Don't tell me!
- Four years!
- l can't take this!
- Empty words...
What are you going to live on?
You'll have to pay child support.
Don't worry, l'll manage.
You must have assets
l'm not aware of.
That is correct, Marianne.
- How is that possible?
- Listen, damn it!
Even though it's none
of your damn business,
l've sold the boat
and l've raised a loan.
The bank will pay you and the girls
1,600 krona a month.
We'll make some other arrangement
when l return.
Get advice from your colleagues,
l don't care.
Name your price!
l'm not taking a thing
apart from my books.
l'll just vanish.
l'll dematerialize.
l'll pay all l can to support you.
All that interests me
is to end this.
Do you know
what l'm most fed up with?
All this carping about
what we're expected to do
and the people
we must accommodate.
What will your mother think?
Hadn't we better ask
so-and-so to dinner?
We have to go here,
we have to go there...
We must celebrate
Christmas, Easter, birthdays...
Every single damn occasion!
- My poor darling...
- l don't want your sympathy!
Stop pawing me!
This is pure affectation,
my running on like this.
l can't get at the truth about us.
There isn't any one truth.
Whichever way we turn, it hurts.
Please don't go!
- l beg you.
- lt's no use.
Postpone your trip.
l believe we can save our marriage.
We could make a fresh start.
You must give me a chance!
Perhaps Paula would understand me.
l should meet her and talk to her...
Let us face this together.
Let me have a chance!
You're facing me
with a fait accompli.
You're forcing me
into an intolerable situation.
You mean:
What are our parents going to say!
What will our friends think?
Jesus, how tongues will wag!
How will it affect the girls?
What about the dinner parties?
What will you tell Peter
and Katarina? Who cares?
lt feels good to be a cad!
That wasn't what l meant.
Forget it...
l forgot to set the alarm.
- When do you need to leave?
- Please set it for 5:30.
l need to pack
and l have a conference at nine.
l've been meaning
to get a new alarm clock.
This one's so noisy
and it's not very reliable.
There, it's set for 5:30.
l'll wake up on my own anyway,
so you needn't worry.
- Tell me about Paula.
- Please... What's the point?
- Why torment yourself?
- l want to know what she's like.
lt's much worse
picturing some faceless threat.
- Do you have a picture of her?
- Can't we be spared this ordeal?
Please help me with this.
Well, you asked for it...
Where's my wallet?
l guess it's in my jacket...
Here are two photos.
That was taken
two years ago, on holiday.
That is her passport photo.
lt's a good likeness.
She has a nice figure.
- And lovely breasts, right?
- Yes, she does...
- Does she dye her hair?
- lt's possible.
- Her smile is nice. How old is she?
- 23.
She hasn't been lucky in love.
She's been engaged twice
and has had lots of affairs.
- Does that bother you?
- Yes, it does...
Her frankness is quite unpleasant.
She insists on giving me
the details of her erotic past.
l suffer from retrospective jealousy.
She has no illusions
and she has no great hopes
for the two of us.
She knows l'll go back to you.
lt all sounds like
a hackneyed old melodrama.
Are you compatible in bed?
Yes, we are, actually.
At first it was all wrong.
l wasn't used to it -
being with other women, l mean.
We've spoiled each other, you and l,
living in a bubble of our own.
Everything's gone like clockwork.
- The lack of oxygen smothered us.
- And Paula will revive you?
l have little self-awareness.
l know little of reality, regardless
of all the books l've read,
but this may be an opportunity
for you and l to really live.
Has Paula filled your head
with rubbish like that?
- Just how naive can you get?
- We can do without your taunts.
- Forgive me.
- l'm trying...
l'm trying to be honest
and it's not easy!
We've never talked like this before.
ls it any wonder we're naive?
What else can we expect?
You're in a tight spot.
Come and lie down beside me.
Come...
l want you to make love to me.
Please?
For old time's sake.
Lie here in my arms
and we'll both go to sleep together.
l don't think l can sleep.
l'd better leave at once.
Close your eyes.
We both need the rest.
Tomorrow will be a busy day.
l'm so damned ashamed.
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, it's just the two of us.
We still have a few hours left.
Just you and l...
- Are you going to pack first or eat?
- You decide.
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.
- What about your mail?
- l'll send you my address.
You can send the letters on,
pay the bills in the usual way.
The plumber was scheduled
to come to fix the bathroom.
Shall l call him?
l figured it might
have slipped your mind.
l've phoned him dozens of times,
l haven't forgotten it.
What about your car?
l've asked Paula's sister
to take care of it.
She needs a car.
l see.
Would you please
cancel my dentist's appointment?
lt's your father's birthday on
Friday, we're supposed to dine there.
Are you planning to phone him?
That's tricky...
Maybe l can write him a letter.
As long as you don't forget.
Dealing with our parents
will be tough.
- What should l tell the girls?
- Say whatever you like.
- That you walked out on us?
- You couldn't have put it better.
l don't expect you to understand me.
l have to leave now,
to avoid traffic.
Goodbye, Marianne. Take care.
- l may be home in a week's time.
- l wish...
We'd make a fresh start.
We'd throw out stale old routines.
We'd talk about the past.
We'd try and find out
where we went wrong.
You'd never hear me blame you.
Johan, it's all so unreal...
l don't know what to do.
You're shutting me out.
Any solution
would be better than this.
Couldn't you promise to come back?
Then l'd have something, at least.
You can't leave me without hope.
Even if you don't intend to return,
tell me you will.
l have to go now.
Fredrik? lt's Marianne.
Sorry to wake you.
ls Birgit there? No, let her sleep.
So, how are you doing?
Oh, you're an early riser, are you?
l won't keep you long.
lt's cloudy... That sounds lovely.
There's something
l need to talk to you about.
l really need to talk...
You and Birgit are friends of ours.
l have to...
lt's all so unreal, Fredrik.
You see...
l'm on the verge of tears
and crying only makes things worse.
Johan has fallen in love
with another woman.
They're leaving for Paris today.
Couldn't you talk to him?
Tell him not to do anything rash.
You've already talked to him?
l see...
So, you both have known all along?
You knew, but you never told me?
And you call yourselves friends?
How could you be so disloyal?
l don't buy your explanations!
All those times we've met
and neither of you said a word...
Damn you!
What kind of friends are you?
To hell with your explanations!
How many others have you known?
Oh, lots of people...
Well, isn't that nice!
THE VALE OF TEARS
Please come in.
My, you're pretty!
What a nice blouse.
l liked it when l bought it,
but it's sort of girlish.
lt suits you.
l feel nervous
standing here like this.
So do l, l've been useless all day.
lt's silly, l know, but l haven't
seen you for over six months.
- How come you suddenly...?
- Paula is in London.
- Like a drink?
- Yes, please.
A whiskey, neat.
lt settles the stomach.
Have you taken to whiskey?
Aunt Berit's looking after the girls,
to everyone's mutual delight.
Tomorrow, they're
going to the country.
Good... Meeting them
might have been awkward.
- How are they?
- Don't ask just to be polite.
Please don't
forget their birthdays again.
l bought them presents from you,
but that didn't fool them.
Can't you take them
to the movies one day?
lt's rough on them
not hearing from you.
They hardly ever
mention you nowadays.
- The way Paula keeps you...
- lf you start ranting, l'm leaving.
You said yourself she's jealous.
Are you such a coward
you can't stand up to her?
l'm sorry.
l know you think it's absurd,
but don't scold me, it won't help.
- Would you like some more whiskey?
- Yes, please.
- How are things, Johan?
- Pretty much as usual.
- And you?
- l can't complain.
lt was silly of me to suggest this.
We can't talk
without hurting each other.
l've got an excellent suggestion,
let's have dinner.
- Then we won't snap at each other.
- An excellent suggestion.
You look awful with that haircut
and you've put on weight.
You really turn me on.
- What are we to do about it?
- We'll see after dinner.
- What delicious wine!
- lt's just some inexpensive claret.
Things are going my way
at the moment.
l've been offered a chair
at Cleveland University.
lt's a good move,
financially and career-wise.
That's where things are happening
and l'll be glad to emigrate,
there's nothing to keep me here.
l'm fed up with this backwater
and l hate being fleeced by taxes.
So l'll leave in the spring,
if all goes well.
Congratulations.
l'm rattling on about myself,
but l'm in such a good mood.
Perhaps we can discuss our divorce.
lf you're emigrating,
we'd better do it now.
- As you like.
- l'd like a divorce.
l may want to remarry, and it would
be complicated if you're in the US.
Do you have someone in mind?
Perhaps.
Come on, tell me more.
- Would you like some more?
- No, thanks. Don't be evasive.
How are things?
Judging by your appearance,
they must be pretty good.
Do you have a lover?
l'll just get the coffee.
Well...
lt sounds as if
you were disappointed.
lt's just your imagination.
l think about you all the time.
Wondering if you're fine,
or lonely and afraid.
Every day, several times a day,
l wonder what l did
to cause the breach between us.
lt's childish of me, l know.
What did l do wrong?
Why not ask a psychiatrist?
l go to one several times a week.
- Sometimes we even meet privately.
- ls he your lover?
We did have sex a few times,
but it was no good.
So we devote ourselves to my soul.
Where has that got you?
Nowhere.
l'm learning to talk, basically.
l threw your things
out of the study and moved mine in.
lt left me feeling guilty, but bold.
lt's led to something, at least.
- What an enormous yawn.
- Sorry, it's the wine.
Also l haven't slept well,
l've been tense.
- lf you'd like to go home...
- Don't get all uptight.
- You can take a nap if you like.
- What a fuss about a yawn.
l'd rather listen
to tales of your mental journey.
There's nothing much to tell.
Though last night
something funny struck me.
That sounds exciting.
My therapist asked me to jot down
whatever popped into my head.
No matter how irrelevant. Anything...
l haven't written much so far,
l'm not used to writing.
lt tends to turn out stilted
and a little silly.
Why don't you read to me
what you wrote last night?
Would you really like to hear it?
l'll just go and get my notebook.
l was up writing to three am,
so l looked a wreck this morning.
lt figures that would happen
the night before l see you.
You look so pretty...
so very pretty, Marianne.
No compliments, please.
Take an interest in my soul instead.
Go and sit down...
Have a seat...
Don't...
Let me read to you.
One good thing
needn't exclude the other.
l think about you constantly,
about having sex with you.
l've been longing for you.
But after you leave,
l'd be left longing for you again.
l love you, don't you realise that?
Sometimes l hate you
for what you did to me.
l rejoice every hour
that passes without a thought of you.
l have friends, lovers, children
and a job l enjoy that l'm good at.
Yet, l'm tied to you.
l don't know why.
Perhaps l'm a masochist,
or else l'm just a one-man-woman.
l don't know...
lt's all so difficult.
l don't want
to live with anyone but you.
Other men bore me.
l'm not trying
to make you feel guilty,
or use emotional blackmail.
l'm just telling you how l feel.
l can't bear you making love to me.
l can't explain it any other way.
lt's because you'll walk away
and l'll be left longing for you.
l've sort of enjoyed
having you at a distance.
So let's keep our hands to ourselves.
You'll just leave me devastated.
l'm... l'm still in love with you.
Why say that when it's not true?
Do you think
l haven't longed for you?
l have... We were friends.
We had fun together.
lf we feel like having sex,
why shouldn't we?
Why have all these reservations?
Why worry about
how you'll feel tomorrow?
No, Johan...
l want you to stop!
l don't want to be mooning over you,
pining and weeping!
lf you're going to persist,
you might as well leave.
l don't want to sleep with you.
Please try and understand that!
l'm doing my best...
All right, l'll sit here...
l'll sit here and you can read to me.
Then l'll go home and phone Paula
and say l've been to the theatre.
May l have more coffee, please
and a brandy?
l feel like a terrible fool.
l want to hide somewhere and cry.
- We can meet tomorrow instead.
- Yes, that might be just as well.
No, it's better you stay...
l'm busy tomorrow.
Hi there...
l'm so very fond of you.
l'm behaving like a child.
The situation is under control.
We've come through the crisis.
l can barely read my own writing.
The beginning isn't important...
''''''Yesterday l was seized
by reckless gaiety.''
For the first time this year,
l felt a zest for life.
''Feeling curious
about what the day will bring.''''''
And so on...
Here it is:
''''''l turned and looked
at the photo of my class at school,''
taken when l was 10.
l seemed to detect something
that had eluded me previously.
To my surprise, l must admit,
l don't know who l am.
Not at all...
l've always done as l was told.
As far as l can remember,
l've been obedient,
well-adjusted, almost meek.
l did assert myself
once or twice as a girl,
but mother punished
all such lapses from convention
with exemplary severity.
My entire upbringing
was aimed at making me agreeable.
l was ugly and graceless.
A fact
l was constantly reminded of.
But if l kept
my thoughts to myself
and was ingratiating,
my behaviour yielded rewards.
The real deception
began at puberty.
My every thought
revolved around sex.
But this l never told my parents,
or anyone at all, for that matter.
Being deceitful and secretive
became second nature to me.
My father wanted me
to become a lawyer like himself.
l said l wanted to be an actress,
or do something else
within the theatrical world,
but they laughed at me.
Since then l go on pretending.
A sham in my relations to others.
To men.
The same sham -
a desperate attempt to please.
l've never considered what l want.
Just:
'What does he want me to think?'
lt's not unselfishness,
as l used to believe,
but sheer cowardice.
lt stems from
being ignorant of who l am.
Our mistake was in not
breaking free of our families
''and creating something
worthwhile on our own terms.''''''
Oh damn, l fell asleep!
Your words were so interesting, too.
Forgive me...
Won't you read some more,
unless you feel offended?
l don't feel offended, but l think
you ought to go home now.
Yes, l'd better be going.
Please call,
if only for the sake of the children.
- You're always welcome here.
- lf only Paula weren't so jealous.
Still, she has good reason...
- When will you know about the US?
- ln a month or so.
- Let me know how it goes.
- Of course, l'll phone you.
We need to make up our minds
about the divorce.
- Do you want to marry again?
- l don't know.
l'd rather wait, what do you think?
l don't know what l think...
- You'll stay the night, won't you?
- Yes.
- How do you feel?
- Frightened...
Let's muster up some courage.
- Can't you sleep?
- Not a chance.
l'd better go home. Forgive me!
- That's Paula's handwriting.
- She wrote to me.
- What's she up to now?
- She sent this before she left.
Read it here.
''''''Dear Marianne, l assure you''
that there is no ulterior motive
behind this letter.
l took this job in London
to break a vicious cycle
of jealousy and suspicion.
l know Johan will look you up
the minute l've gone.
l've only myself to blame, as l've
stopped him from seeing you all.
''lf only it was possible
to put things right.''''''
- How like Paula!
- She wants us to be friends.
- She can't endure hostility.
- How touching. And you believe her?
''''''Johan is the gentlest
and kindest person l've ever met.''
He lacks self-confidence,
''though he tries to appear
so brave and cheerful.''''''
You can say anything about anyone.
lt always fits in some respect.
THE lLLlTERATES
l'm glad we could meet here.
lt saves time.
- lt's not exactly cosy.
- But suitable for divorce matters.
Here's the agreement,
word for word as we decided.
- Then l don't need to read it.
- Always read before signing.
- Don't look so grumpy.
- l'm not grumpy.
Here's the list of our joint property
and its distribution.
lt's just a list,
it doesn't require a signature.
You get Granny's clock?
That must be a mistake.
- But she left it to me.
- l don't recall that.
lf you're so attached to it keep it,
but it is mine.
You're always right, aren't you?
Take the damn clock!
- Check that l haven't fleeced you.
- Your sarcasm is wasted on me.
l have such a miserable cold.
What do you say
to a glass of fine old brandy?
Yes, l think we should
have one now.
Egerman gave me a bottle.
Some grateful Parisian colleagues
gave him a whole case. Cheers!
Not bad, huh? l like it.
l don't care for brandy as a rule,
but this is nice.
l feel better already.
lt's rough all the same.
- Getting divorced.
- lt's just paperwork.
We've been living apart for ages
and we're in agreement,
but feelings of guilt linger on.
lt's strange... Johan?
- What?
- lt's strange.
On my way over
l was determined not to cry.
You said you felt guilty.
Let's go and sit on the sofa instead.
Put the lights out,
the glare is ghastly.
How can you work
in such a bleak room?
The sofa isn't
very comfortable either.
lf you put your feet up, it's fine.
- More brandy?
- Yes, please.
- Comfy?
- Very.
- ls this whole place empty?
- There's a nightwatchman.
How nice!
- l just think it's nice.
- Nothing's nice with a cold.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You're not going to die. Cheers!
- This gets better and better.
- Aren't you in good spirits!
To be honest, l'm in love.
- With that David person?
- No, that's over.
Give me a kiss.
- But l'm ill.
- l never catch your germs.
Give me a kiss, l want you to.
- Was it what you expected?
- Much better.
Now, put your hand on my breast.
- Are you seducing me?
- That's right.
Right here on the carpet. Right now.
Doesn't that sound fun?
You look suspicious.
Afraid of the nightwatchman?
We're still married, after all.
Come, lie on top of me.
People should make love
on the floor more often.
- Lock the door.
- No one will walk in on us.
- l'm kind of a prude.
- Just in case the watchman comes.
- He might be eavesdropping.
- No, he's doing his rounds.
ls it wise to take your trousers off
with that cold?
- You can warm me.
- So you don't freeze your thing...
Poor baby, you're so miserable...
lt's lovely being kissed by you.
l enjoy it so...
What if...?
Shut your eyes,
or l'll feel self-conscious.
Put your hands on my hips.
That's nice...
What if the watchman walked in now?
He could join us. We're liberated.
Let's stay here all night...
...and just drink and make love.
Tomorrow, we'll file
our divorce papers.
A penny for your thoughts.
l'm not telling.
- Are you hungry?
- l always am.
What about
a steak tartare and some beer?
You're not supposed to take me out.
l'm in Uppsala with my students.
Poor Paula!
ln that case,
l'd love to dine with you.
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the corridor, to the left.
Let's sign these papers
and go out and celebrate.
Pay tribute
to a long and happy marriage.
l think l'll take them home with me.
Why do an about-face now?
You said yourself to read things
through before signing them.
Let's read it through from A to Z,
so you see
that l haven't cheated you.
- Why are you so upset?
- l'm not. Let's get moving.
- You look pissed off to me.
- l am, but l'll control myself.
Like l always do
when l'm subjected to your whims.
Can we end this boring discussion?
lt's late and tomorrow's a work day.
- Don't you want to have supper?
- No, thank you.
l'm grateful for
the favours bestowed on me.
- Talk about whims...
- Now look here, Johan!
lt's pointless
even trying to discuss this now.
Let's stuff these into an envelope,
then you can take them home.
Then you and Paula
can pore over the wording
to see that l haven't screwed you.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We were good friends a minute ago.
Don't forget Eva's birthday.
- Do l usually?
- No, because l always remind you.
Could you pay for her trip to France?
- How much is that?
- 2,000 krona.
That's out of the question!
- Then let your mother pay.
- l've borrowed too much as it is.
l've just paid for Karin's orthodontist.
- Doesn't she have free dental care?
- She refuses to go to that place.
Eva will have to cancel her trip.
lt won't hurt her to learn
that she can't have everything.
She's too damned spoilt
and ill-mannered!
- Mother was appalled last week.
- Your mother told you that?
Well, Eva is at a difficult age.
Don't let the girls rule the roost.
l have their complete confidence
and for that l'm grateful.
l couldn't care less
about petty details like manners.
l can't afford the trip.
Tell her that.
- Tell her yourself.
- Why? You have custody.
l merely fork out
huge sums for child support,
leaving me high and dry.
You and l were born
with silver spoons in our mouths.
We've squandered our resources,
leaving us poor, bitter, and angry.
However trite, it's the truth:
We're emotional illiterates.
We've been taught about anatomy
and African farming methods.
We've learned
mathematical formulas by heart.
We haven't been taught
a thing about the mind.
We're ignorant
about what makes people tick.
That signals the end of my lecture.
More brandy?
Then we can decide about supper.
l don't agree with you.
By the way, that job in the US
has gone to blazes.
- Not that it matters.
- What a shame!
Well, l was pretty disappointed.
There was
the usual wheeling and dealing.
First, things were postponed,
then there was no money...
Then they sent someone else.
That's life. Cheers!
l'll be 45 this summer.
l can expect
to live another 30 years...
Viewed objectively, l'm dead weight.
l'll spend the next 20 years
being a damn nuisance.
l'm an expensive, unproductive unit
that should be eliminated.
And l'm supposed to be in my prime,
brimming with useful experience!
''But it's: ''''Throw the loser out.''
''Let him rot.''''''
l'm so damn tired.
l hardly know who l am.
Someone spat on me
and now l'm drowning in the spittle.
- Am l boring you?
- lt's funny...
l wanted to have sex with you today
to see if l felt anything.
All l felt was lukewarm affection.
l think l'm breaking free at last.
lt's taken a long time
and it's been very painful,
but l'm free of you now
and can live my own life.
Allow me to congratulate you.
lt's callous of me to say this
when you're having a rough time,
but oddly enough, l don't care.
l've taken your feelings
into account far too often.
Being considerate killed our love.
Had l not been sidetracked by guilt,
l'd have known
everything we did was wrong.
Remember after Karin was born?
When we couldn't sleep together?
How we put the blame
on my two pregnancies.
We concocted many reasons why
our lovemaking gave us no pleasure.
Warning lights
were flashing all around us,
but we ignored them.
These post-mortems are so pointless.
Your idiotic sarcasm
drives me crazy!
Why should you tell me
what to think and feel?
Lord, how l hate you!
l often used to think:
'Lord, how l hate her!'
Especially when we made love
and l felt your indifference
and when l saw you naked
at the bidet afterwards -
washing off the nasty stuff
l'd deposited inside you.
l would think: 'l hate her body,
the way she moves.'
l should have beaten you.
l wanted to strike down
your hard, white resistance,
but we chatted away and talked
about how well we got along.
Then why do l enjoy sex now?
- l do everything he asks.
- Just you wait.
When you're married to him,
you'll do the same thing again.
Your behaviour is deeply rooted.
Then you'll look for a new lover
to free you from your loathing.
You're wrong.
There is such a thing
as straightforward tenderness.
To say nothing of sensuousness
and physical desire.
For you that's all blocked.
Do you imagine that l didn't suffer
when we didn't hit it off?
l'd think:
'ls this misery all there is?'
We'd console ourselves with the
thought that sex wasn't everything.
That in other respects, we were
happy. Talk about self-deception!
You're forgetting certain things.
Then please enlighten me.
You cashed in on your sex organs.
They became a bargaining chip.
A night of sex for a night of peace.
Good behaviour earned me a lay.
Bad behaviour or criticism
made you withdraw.
You were worse than any whore!
- You would never face the truth.
- Some cosmic truth, or your truth?
The way you made me your doormat!
Am l a substitute for your mother?
All that carping about
how l neglected the home.
That's a lie!
You heaped guilt on me!
You and your parents!
l felt inadequate
at work and at home
and l was a lousy lay as well.
l was hedged in by all the griping
and endless demands.
lf l used my sex organs,
was that so strange?
l was fighting against hopeless odds:
You, my mother,
your parents, and society!
When l think of what l endured,
l could scream!
l tell you this: Never again!
You sit there
whining about conspiracies.
lt serves you damn well right!
l hope it will be
rammed down your throat
that you're a useless parasite.
- You're being utterly grotesque!
- You made me that way!
The difference between us
is that l fight it!
l intend to face reality
just as it is.
lf there's one thing
l truly appreciate, it's being alive.
l enjoy overcoming difficulties.
- l don't ask for special allowances.
- How nice!
Then we needn't
feel sorry for each other.
We're getting quite human.
lt's a pity we ever
met in the first place
and decided to live together -
what a glorious fiasco!
The sooner
we sign the papers, the better.
We'll divide our worldly goods
and go our separate ways.
lt was all just a ghastly mistake.
l know what's on your mind.
- You don't want a divorce!
- That's absurd!
- Then sign the papers.
- All right, l will.
Be honest now... Look at me!
You don't want a divorce, do you?
Well, would that be such a crime?
l concede defeat,
is that what you want to hear?
l'm sick of Paula.
l want to come home.
Don't look at me like that.
l'm a failure. l'm going downhill.
l'm scared and rootless.
My timing is all wrong...
- lf you think pity will help...
- l'm giving you a straight answer.
l was bound to you
in a deeper way than l knew.
l needed our home
and to lead a regular life.
l'm tired of being alone.
Loneliness with Paula
is worse than being all alone.
l can't stand either.
l won't go on... Now you know.
Please send a cab
to Malmrosgatan 45.
Want a lift?
You really shouldn't drive.
- l'll stay here for a while.
- Please don't brood.
lt's none of your business!
- l want you to stay.
- But l don't want to.
You're tired and drunk. Let me go.
- l don't want you to go.
- Don't be ridiculous.
We've never behaved like this.
Give me the key.
l don't give a damn what you say.
Your orderly mind is reeling.
''''''What do l do now?''''''
''''''Has he gone mad?''''''
''''''ls he going to beat me?''''''
You're quite a riot, actually.
Then why aren't you laughing?
You look scared to me.
Let me cancel the cab...
What for?
They only wait around
for 10 minutes or so.
Sit down and take it easy.
- This will take quite a while.
- Fine...
- So, what do you want to say?
- Nothing.
- l want to look at you.
- Go ahead.
l might have expected this.
l've often warned wives
in the process of a divorce
against spending time alone
with their husbands.
Yet here l am.
Shut your mouth!
l'm not afraid,
l couldn't care less what you do.
- Shut up, l said!
- You maniac!
Give me the key,
l'll go and wash off this blood.
l'm not letting you out.
- You arsehole!
- You bitch!
l'll show you!
l could kill you! l could kill you!
Oh, Marianne...
Listen, are you all right?
l guess l've only myself to blame...
Will you give me the key now?
- Shall l help you?
- No, don't come near me.
lN THE DEAD OF NlGHT
lN A DARK HOUSE
What fun this is!
l went to the cottage yesterday
and turned the heating on
and stocked up on food,
just like old times.
- When did l last see the place?
- Seven years ago.
- What about you?
- l don't spend much time there.
Henrik's not fond of the seaside.
The girls and l
go there occasionally,
but they have
their own lives to lead.
- How is your husband?
- Overworked.
He suffers from high blood pressure.
- How's your wife?
- She's in ltaly, for a rest cure.
Funny that they're both abroad.
lt's almost indecent, l think.
That is what's so nice.
- The place hasn't changed much.
- lt's a bit shabby.
lt needs doing up,
but we can't afford it.
Put the car away, or Erik will see it
and be over like a shot.
- That could be embarrassing.
- l will, dear...
- Aren't you going to do it now?
- No, later.
This does feel a little strange...
Let's stretch out on the bed...
l'm nervous.
lt's like the first time.
But it's not.
lt's been nearly a year now.
lt was the day before my birthday
and today's August 28th.
You seduced me.
Did you ever see
the last act of that play?
lt must have looked funny,
our sneaking off like that.
- What made you decide?
- l don't know...
l saw you
the second l entered the theatre.
lt seemed natural to approach you.
l was terribly pleased.
So was l.
''- And you said: ''''Let's leave.''''
- And you blushed.''
- No wonder. l had such a hard-on.
- You got me pretty hot too.
We hadn't met for two whole years.
That's right, exactly two years.
And now today's
our first anniversary.
No...
lt's not our first anniversary.
lt's our 20th.
We got married in August,
20 years ago.
lt's an entire lifetime.
A whole grown-up life together.
lsn't that strange?
My dear! Sweetheart...
lt's this wretched old bed...
Our hotel rooms
were suitably impersonal.
lt was wrong of us to come here.
- We should have gone to Denmark.
- There wasn't time.
- This is all right.
- No, it isn't.
l'll call Fredrik. He has a cottage.
- How will we get in?
- l expect a neighbour has a key.
There's no harm in trying.
Fredrik? lt's Johan.
How are you? l've never been better.
Look, this is rather
a delicate matter. Are you alone?
Could l possibly borrow
your cottage for the weekend?
Exactly, something like that...
Very pretty. Young...?
She's almost too young!
lt's a sticky situation.
That's great!
l owe you a favour.
Don't say a word to Birgit now.
Women don't
understand these things.
Right...
The key is under the stone step.
Yes... Blonde.
With a great figure...
l'll call you.
l really appreciate it.
Thanks. Give my love to Birgit.
No, scratch that last suggestion.
- l found it.
- lt's lovely!
Here's the step. lt must be here.
- Let's clear up.
- Right.
What's wrong? You're crying.
You're so touching. l'm being silly.
Touching? That's amazing.
lt's the truth.
My dear, beloved Johan...
You've become so small.
You're so handsome this way.
You used to look so tense.
- Are people beastly to you?
- l don't know.
l've stopped being on the defensive.
Someone said l'd become slack
and gave in too easily.
l've accepted my true dimensions
with a certain sense of humility.
lt makes me kind and sad.
And you with your great expectations.
Those were my family's expectations.
l really wanted to live up to them.
You wanted
to know about my husband?
Getting married was a mistake.
lt was more of a joke.
When did you meet?
A few years ago.
lt was a purely sexual affair.
l see...
Henrik is... How shall l put this?
Very convincing in that respect.
He truly enjoys sex
and he made me realise
l felt the same way.
l wasn't all that keen before.
l remember.
You don't like this subject, do you?
But it can't be helped.
l was obsessed
by this new sensation.
l felt insatiable.
How nice... for you.
l became very attached to Henrik
and he liked me a lot,
but l caught him
with other women.
What do you know?
l was hurt and humiliated,
even jealous.
Jealous, you?
We had a violent scene
and l told him to go to hell.
- So, did he?
- Yes.
He said l was too histrionic.
l begged him to come back.
You look preoccupied.
Everything's fine, that's all.
Things just couldn't be better.
- lt's just that l can't stand it.
- l knew it!
As if l care about
your orgasms with that workaholic.
l applaud your emancipation.
You should write a novel.
The women's libbers would rejoice.
You're being ridiculous...
l tell you l don't give a damn.
lt suddenly mattered so terribly.
lt's just a taste
of the marvellous things
life has to offer.
Think of the awareness we've gained.
lt's magnificent!
We've discovered ourselves.
One faces up to his insignificance,
the other, to her greatness.
Here we are, trashing our spouses.
They're in this room with us.
lt's mental group sex to the max.
lt's like a textbook on life.
lt's fabulous, but l can't bear it.
l see, but l don't find it terrible.
l can't abide this cold light
directed on my every endeavour.
How l battle with futility.
l try to cheer myself up thinking
that life is what you make of it,
but those are empty words.
l want something to long for.
l don't feel the same way.
l realise that.
l persevere.
l enjoy myself.
l rely on common sense
and my gut feeling.
They work together.
l'm content with my direction.
Time has given me a third partner:
Experience.
You should be a politician.
Maybe you're right...
l like people.
l enjoy negotiations,
prudence, compromises...
Rehearsing your election speech?
- Am l so impossible?
- Only when you preach.
l'm not going to say another word.
No more home truths?
l promise.
Promise you won't mention
that orgasmic superman again.
Promise to reign in
your awful level-headedness.
lt will be difficult, but l'll try.
Could you possibly...
...use your female power sparingly?
l'll have to.
All right, then...
Let's go to bed.
What is it? There, there...
Come, sit here with me.
There, there...
What brings on nightmares like that?
- Perhaps it was something you ate.
- Do you think so?
Unless there's something
in your orderly world...
...you can't get at.
Hold me, l'm shivering.
l think l've
come down with something.
- The girls have had colds...
- You'll soon feel better.
Pull the covers up. That's nice...
What were you dreaming about?
We were crossing a dangerous road.
l wanted you and the girls
to hold on to me,
but my hands were gone.
All l had left were stumps
and l'm sliding around in soft sand.
You're on the road
and l can't reach you...
What a horrible dream!
Do we live our lives in confusion?
- All of us.
- What do you mean?
Fear, uncertainty, a lack of wisdom.
Are we sliding downhill
and don't know what to do?
Yes, l think so.
ls it too late?
Yes,
but we shouldn't
say things like that.
Johan, have we missed
something important?
- All of us?
- No, you and l.
At times l can read your mind
and feel such tenderness.
l forget myself
without losing myself.
lt's a new sensation.
l understand.
lt grieves me
that l've never loved anyone.
l don't think
l've ever been loved either.
That distresses me.
Now you're being histrionic.
l know what l feel.
l love you in my selfish way
and l think you love me,
in your fussy, pestering way.
We love each other
like people do here on earth,
but you're so demanding.
Yes, l am.
lt's as simple as this:
Here l am in a dark house
somewhere in the world,
with my arms around you
and you are here in my arms.
l lack empathy
for my fellow human beings.
l'm low on imagination, l suppose.
l don't know what my love looks like
and l can't describe it.
Most of the time l don't feel it.
You think l love you too?
Yes, l do.
lf we harp on, love will vanish.
Let's stay like this all night.
Oh, let's not...
One of my legs has gone to sleep,
my left arm is dislocated,
l'm sleepy and my back is cold.
Then let's snuggle down.
Good night, my darling.
lt was good talking to you.
- Sleep well.
- You too.
