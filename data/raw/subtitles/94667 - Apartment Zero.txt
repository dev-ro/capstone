is that all you have
to say for him?

he was some kind of a man.
What does it matter
what you say about people?

Please, tell me,
Is joseph cotten
Or robert montgomery?
Joseph cotten.
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.
Tomorrow.
That's a promise.
Don't worry,
there's no rush.
( Crickets chirping )
We just have to get
through this dry spell.
And once the james dean
retrospective starts up
next month, we'll be fine.
He always works miracles.
I am more worried
about you than about
my paycheck.
Don't be ridiculous.
Worry about the paycheck.
You know, christian
says you could make
some more money
If you rented
the cinema in the mornings
To committees
or whatever.
Christian...
yes, he's the one you
let in free, isn't he?
( Laughs )
He was supposed
to come today.
I wonder
what happened.
Christian.
Yeah, well, i can imagine
Exactly what kind
of committees he'd
have me mixed up with.
Thank you, claudia.
You can tell christian
That i'd rather keep
the drama in my cinema
Somewhat above
the level of political
shouting matches.
Oh god, if it wasn't using
such offensive things,
i'd take offense.
( Car starts )
- ( Women chattering )
- I've been going on
about mice for weeks.
Woman #2:
just for once,
will you kindly...
woman #1:
that cat doesn't
like them either.
You just leave it
all to me, don't you?
- Woman #1: poor little cats.
- Ladies.
It's absolutely
disgraceful.
Señor leduc!
We're sending
for the exterminator.
Excuse me please.
Good night.
Excuse me.
- Oh, yes.
- Leduc: good night.
Señor leduc!
Señor sanchez-Verne
found mice in his apartment!
Well,
traces actually.
Oh, don't tell lies.
Now you've been going on
About these mice
all the time.
We think the whole
building may be infested.
There are no mice
in my apartment.
Well, you can't really
be sure, can you?
We think
The exterminator should
do the whole building.
Mice work
in mysterious ways.
No, dear, that's god.
I'll inspect it,
mrs. Treniev.
Thank you
for the warning.
And if there are
any mice, i shall come
to terms with them myself.
Good night.
Again.

No, that's going

Do you speak english?
I was inquiring about
the apartment next door.
I knocked a couple of times
and there was no answer.
Do you know if
it's been rented?
Yes?
- Yes, of course, come in.
- Hi, i...
( stammers )
i'm sorry, i really...
i must apologize,
i have very nosy neighbors.
That's all right.
She's very pretty.
You're american.

No, hartford, connecticut.
Isn't there where...

I'm sure it's hartford.
Is that brando?
- It's montgomery clift.
- Oh yeah, clift, yeah.
That's what i meant.
I... run a cinema club.
Hmm.
Videos?
No.
No no, real movies
on a real screen.
Videos are killing me.
You know, people...
people develop
big backsides
And-And blisters
on their thumbs
From skimming through

It's...
don't even own
a television.
Why not?
Afraid you
might like it?
( Laughs softly )
Let me show you
the rest of the shack.
I'll, um...
have you ever...
- done any acting?
- ( Laughs )
Me?No.
( Laughs )
what, are you kidding?
Where are you from?
Kitchen.
Can't you tell
by my accent?
- Well, you...
you sound british.
- Very good.
This is the room.
And the...
the bathroom's
through here.
Nice.
And you can use the...
the living room
and the kitchen
Whenever you like.
Great.
Uh... i can give you
an answer by tonight.
( Stammers )
is the rent okay?
- It's negotiable...
- No, it's good, it's fine.
- If-If you want, i can...
- It's fine.
I- I haven't asked you.
What do you do?
I'm with intercomp,
part of their
exchange program.
- The-The computer company?
- Yeah.
It's just... it's within
walking distance of here.
- It's just around
the back of harrods.
- Really?
Yes.
I don't know.
- My horoscope says
"avoid decisions."
- Here, let me see that.
- What are you?
- Gemini.
That's nonsense.
You...
are an aquarius...
like james dean.
See?It says
"seize opportunity."
Can i just
switch like that?
I mean, is that legal?
- Is that what you
want me to do?
- Absolutely.
A- A-Aquarius.
I take full responsibility.
Deal.
What are you doing?
I was just looking
to see if they
were dirty.
( Laughs )
yeah, they're dirty.
Well, i was just
on my way down
to the laundry
So i why don't
i take them?
You want
to do my laundry?
It's all...
all the same to me.
I'm just gonna do
my own, so two shirts
Or-Or... or five,
What difference
does it make?
Well, you don't
have to do that.
It's not a problem,
i mean, i was just...
just going
to do it anyway.
In fact, in future,
Why don't you just
leave them...
well, outside the door
and i can...
i can take them,
it's...
( chuckles )
sure.Thanks.
Fine.
Just...
( laughs )
Uh, what time do you leave
for work in the morning?
9:00-Ish.
Perfect.
"Perfect... "
( Birds twittering )
- Morning.
- You're just in time.
Scrambled eggs?
Great.
Listen, i don't
want you to think
That i'm some sort of...
that i'm a regular
felix unger.
I mean, you can
spit in your coffee
if you like.
I don't mind.
Who's felix unger?
What?
An american who doesn't
know "the odd couple"?
Mmm, okay, yeah.
I'm not very good
with names.
So...
how long have you been
in argentina?
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.
I'm an argentinean,
born and bred.
Oh, we lived
in england for 16 years.
My father was
a cultural attaché.
- So you speak spanish.
- Of course.
But i prefer everybody
to think i don't.
Even with my mother
i only speak english and...
she does as well.
I haven't the heart
to tell her she sounds
like erich von stroheim.
It doesn't matter.
You know, does well
for both of us.
Keeps everybody
at a proper distance,
don't you think?
I never thought
about it.
I only hope that
nobody ever tells
A very funny joke
in spanish in front of me
Or i'd give
the whole thing away
like in "hangmen also die."
You see it?
Do you like movies?
Okay.
I got one.
You ready?
Al "passino"...
- james caan...
- It's al pacino.
- Al pacino?
- Yes.
Okay.
Al pacino,
( Sniffs )
james caan,
Diane keaton.
- "The godfather."
- It's too easy?
You have to make it
a little bit more
difficult.
If you give me
three actors...
it doesn't have to be
the central stars...
just give me three
actors of any film,
And i'll get it
every time.
All right, here's one.
Yul brynner,
vincent price
- And edward g. Robinson.
- That's a piece of cake.
What?You don't know?
You want me to tell you?
Uh...
"the ten commandments."
No, i saw that film.
Edward g. Robinson,
The guy who
played gangsters?
Huh-Uh.
You don't believe me?
Don't believe me?
- What?You just happen
to have that at the ready?
- Yes.
There we are.

Well, she's...

And so are you!
- Jon voight...

- Jon voight,
anthony perkins and...
oh god...
you know, man...
- art garfunkel...
- "Catch-22"!
Shit!
You see, you ruined it
with art garfunkel.
- He's only done
four movies.
- Oh.

all over his little face.

i could help...
are you a doctor?
( Laughs )
no, i'm jack...
jack carney.
Are you australian?
Oh, it's none
of our business, dear.
It was
an innocent question.
Anyone can be
an australian nowadays.
I'm actually american.
Oooh,
didn't i tell you?
- ( Woman giggles )
- You're the tenant
from zero, aren't you?
We saw the advertisement
in "the herald."
We were very surprised.
Mr. Leduc is such
a private person.
- Oh, very surprised.
- But we were glad,
We were glad,
weren't we, margaret?
- Oh, very glad...
- Very glad.
- Kitty?
- ( Cat meows )
Oh, it's all right,
mr. Palma, you can
come down now.
We've got
reinforcements.
We should be so grateful
if you could save
mohammed for us.
- He's like a nephew to us.
- Yes.
( Delighted gasps )
- ( Cheering )
- Oh, bravo!
( Cheering,
chattering )
What are marvelous boy
you are.
Thank you so much.
Oh, mr. Leduc!
Mohammed is
alive and well
Thanks to your
charming tenant.
- Will you come and have
a glass of sherry with us?
- ( Purring )
- Both of you.
- I'm sorry, i'm in a hurry.
Were you on your way
in or out?
I'll be up
in a bit.
( Cooing, chattering )
The sherry wasn't
in evidence.
- I had to settle for port.
- Odd.
- Thank you.
- I hope you like port,
mr. Carney.
Port is terrific.
To you, mr. Carney.
- ( Laughs )
- To you, mr. Carney.
We're not used
to gallantry anymore.
No, not anymore.
When señor alvarez
was alive...
we were going
to be married,
You know, that's why
we came here.
But he died three days
before the wedding.
- Three weeks, dear.
- He was a gentlemen,
In the purest
sense of the word.
- Oh, the purest.
- I'll never get over it.
Never.
Where's the bottle, dear?
It's in the kitchen.
It's empty.
1947...
you never saw 1947,
did you, mr. Carney?
That's the year
we came here
And became a...
sort of a widow.
Margaret:
we're boring you silly,
mr. Carney.
No no, please, go on.
We're living next door
to each other,
I think it's a good idea
to get to know each other.
How true, mr. Carney.
We only wish
your friend mr. Leduc
Was of the same persuasion.
Margaret, what a shocking
thing to say.
Well...
i feel as if i can be
direct with mr. Carney.
Yes.
You can, i think
i know what you mean.
We've nothing
against mr. Leduc.
We've been very nice
to him, haven't we, dear?
Well, we've tried our best,
the way people should.
- But he behaves as if
we owe him money.
- Mmm.
He's a great guy.
I've actually grown
quite close to him.
His mother,
Is she still in the...
- yes.
- Mmm.
I feel as if he's going
the same way somehow.
It could be a family thing,
you know?
No, he's, uh...
he's just having
a very difficult time
with his mother.
( Muttering )
Shouldn't he be
in some kind of care?
Sometimes he behaves
in a most unspeakable way,
And not everybody's as
understanding as we are.
No, not as understanding
as we are.
Perhaps now that
you're here, mr. Carney,
Things'll be different.
( Laughing )
for us, anyway.
Somebody for us
to talk to.
Someone with
a recognizable accent.
( Laughs )
( Women laughing )
Jack!
Ladies, thank you
very much.
Now if you feel
like a chat,
You must come and see us.
Ours is an open home.
( Door creaks )
I was only
trying to help.
I'm not...
angry with you.
I... you-You...
i know you don't know
what these people are like.
Just...
jack...
there's only one rule here
And that is:
avoid the neighbors.
Just... avoid the neighbors.
Don't... don't take them
Into your confidence
and give them nothing.
They've been trying
to find their way into me,
You know, like,
like-Like-Like
dirty little worms.
It's not because they care,
not because they-They like me.
It... it's just that...
just to satisfy their
morbid pointless curiosity.
To-To corrode, to...
to invade!
To chit-Chat!
All right, adrian.
All right.
( Quietly )
think i'm paranoid.
You probably think
i'm paranoid.
Well, perhaps i am.
I haven't really
got anything...
specific against
these people.I...
well, i don't know
them well enough
To really
despise them.
And i don't
intend to.
It's privacy, you know?
It's very important.
( Sighs )
Well, we're all
entitled to...
one or two... hundred
idiosyncrasies.
Now you know
one of mine.
- Oh!
- ( Laughing )
- ( Chuckles )
- Carlos: good evening, ladies.
Hello.
Jack carney, i suppose.
- Yeah.
- Carlos sanchez-Verne.
I'm in number six.
I've heard all about
your salvation of the cat.
Yeah, i'm actually surprised
it hasn't made the papers.
Let's have a drink
one of these days.
Any time.

Cop:
the method of killing
is identical to those used
By certain elements
within the task forces
Or death squads here
from 1977 on.
We don't want to make
a political issue
Out of this police matter,
but it is a fact
That all those people
who engaged in torture
and murder
For the military government
are free.
They haven't
even been tried.
In many instances,
we don't know their identities.
From the moment that their
right to follow orders
Was condoned
in this country,
We allowed a new breed
of citizen to function
within our system freely,
A breed that kills
as a way of life.
( Cabaret music playing )
( Singing in spanish )
( Silent )
( Singing continues )
Someone you know?
- Yeah, it's carlos.
- Carlos?
Hmm, carlos.
Since when did you
and he have a-A...
your neighbors are nice.
They talk to me.
What do you want me to do?
Just do what i do.
"Good morning, good night"
and that's it.
- Adrian, they're harmless.
- Ha!
Woman:
shhh.
Listen.
You're being
very childish.
Oh, believe me, i know
what i'm talking about.
Only the next thing is
"can i borrow some sugar?"
Then it's "can i
use your telephone?
Mine's out of order."
Then before we know it, we're
all living together like one
great big happy ugly family...
he seems like
a perfectly nice guy.
He doesn't know
who geraldine page is.
- Hello?
- ( Sniffs )
You're actually
going around asking people
who geraldine page is
- Before you can make up
your mind about them?
- No-No...
- that's not what i said!
When geraldine page died...
- ( Music stops )
- ... We had
a tribute at the club.
- ( Applauding )
And sanchez-Verne had just
moved in so i gave him a chance
and he blew it.
You know, "who...
who's geraldine page?"
I mean, i just knew
i couldn't talk to him
any more after that.
You make it pretty
difficult for yourself,
don't you?
It's gonna
take you a while
before you find
Two or three
other people like you.
Are you calling me
a freak?
Adrian.
Adrian.
I'm calling you
special.
Special?
You're calling me
s- Special?
I can't... i mean...
you should be a politician,
- You really should.
- Am i right or am i right?
I mean, if you were
a bit more tolerant
Of other people's
inadequacies,
You might not
be living alone.
( Stammers )
sorry? Who's living alone?
Where do you live?
- What are you,
an optical illusion?
- I don't count.
Why not?
Because
i'm special too.
Okay, i-I'll...
i'll go over there.
I'll... i'll...
( stammers )
invite him over
to join us for a drink.
- Will that make you happy?
- I am happy.
Now order me
a screwdriver, will you?
I have to go to the john.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How're you doing?
( Unzips )
Fine.
I'm sorry to ask,
but what's the problem
with your friend?
He acts as if
i'd taken away
his ice cream.
( Laughs )
That's just
the way he is.
- Who's the girl?
- Not bad, huh?
Unfortunately, i don't
seem to be her type.
It's her loss.
( Zips )
have a drink later?
Why not?
I'll take her back
and be at home
in an hour or two.
( Smacks )
see ya.
See you.
( Zips )
Hey!
( Laughs )
( Men chattering )
( Lock rattling )
How on earth
did we get here?
That is my question
to you, sir.
I would just like to say,
before i retire,
That i thought
it was a lot of fun.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
- ( Sighs )
you want some help?
- ( Keys drop )
No.Thank you.
I can hold my liquor,
thank you very much.
What do you think?
- ( Door opens )

Cheers.
You have a double,
did you know that?
Ha.A double.
( Clicks teeth )
Tony blakely...
we went to
boarding school together.
We were real close.
Both fanáticos
about rugby.
He was something
on the field.
A natural athlete,
you know?
One of those
perfect bodies.
Girls wet their pants
every time he showed up.
I kind of miss him.
I mean, he was...
i... i don't miss him
like you would miss a...
anyway,
I wouldn't mind if he was
here tonight with me.
With us.
Strange.
What?
No, i mean here i am
talking to you
About tony...
i haven't seen him in...
12...
13 years, you know?
But i remember him
very well.
( Laughing )
I suppose a shrink could
do a lot with that, huh?
An unfulfilled fantasy.
I mean,
an adolescent fantasy.
( Thundering )
He was much older
than me that way.
We were the same
age, but...
he wasn't afraid.
I really look like him?
Look at that.
Carlos and tony.
( Laughing )
- So what did you think?
- Wow.
- Jack: the young guy, the one
that faints at the trial...
- Dean stockwell.
- Yeah.
- Terrific, isn't he?
- Yeah.
- Did you see
"blue velvet"?
No, i... i saw
"national velvet,"
- But i guess that
doesn't count, does it?
- Ha.
So when was this
"compulsion" made,
anyway?
- 1958.
- Why the hell was it
shot in black and white?
Well, it was a...
a black-And-White
kind of movie.
I mean, woody allen
shoots films in
black and white even now.
Well, not recently.
Yeah, i guess that's true.
Look, let's get out of here.
Let's go pick up some chicks
And have some fun,
what do you say?
- What for?
- ( Laughs )
What for...
i mean, a quick exchange
of bodily fluids, what for.
- Isn't aids a consideration...
- Aw, come on!
I'm sorry,
i think you're being
very irresponsible.
- And i won't have
any part of it...
- Okay, fine fine fine.
Okay, fine.
I mean, i didn't mean
to offend you, but...
you told me about one
of your idiosyncrasies,
here's one of mine.
Number one,
I like mixed company...
male-Female...
sometimes it works,
adrian.
But you're not talking
about male and female,
You're talking about casual
copulation and i'm sorry,
It's not for me.
( Coughs )
Don't you like
girls, adrian?
Hmm?
No, i don't like girls.
I like women.
The kind that
can't be picked up.
Fuck you.
You're... you're not
actually going?
You bet i am.
I'm sorry!
( Sirens wailing )
( Police radios
chattering )
( Water splashing )
( Toilet flushes )
Alberto?
Alberto...
i'm sorry, i thought...
please let me go.
I don't sleep very well
when my husband's away.
When i heard you come in
i thought it was him.
I thought...
i thought perhaps
he's back.I thought...
i thought perhaps
he changed his mind.
But he never
changes his mind.
Hey.
It's okay.
( Horn blares )
( Sirens wailing
in distance )
( Door closes )
Hmm.
You must
think that i am...
have a good night's rest.
Please don't go!
Forgive me, i don't know
what's the matter with me.
I hardly know you.
If you knew me,
you wouldn't talk.
You wouldn't confess
your sins to your husband,
your father.
You confess them
to a stranger because
he'll absolve you.
Yes.Yes.
You know,
My father was
the perfect stranger.
He understood...
everything.
I saw him
only once a year,
Until the day he died.
Then he was gone...
and i felt lost.
Alberto, my husband,
doesn't have a clue.
He... he thinks i'm moody.
( Laughs )
I can't explain it to him.
I know it's stupid.
It's so stupid.
I'm a grownup.
A married woman.
But i need my father back.
I want him back.
I need...
what does
my little girl need?
- ( Birds twittering )
- ( Car horns blaring )
Jack?
( Knocks )
There's breakfast.
Jack, are you all right?
- ( Keys jangling )
- Jack?
Jack!
Jack, are you
in there?Jack!
Jack, can you
hear me?!
Yeah, i can hear you
and so can the rest
of the neighborhood.
Oh, jack.
Hello, i...
i... i thought something awful
had happened, i was just...
it was touch
and go for a while,
but i pulled through.
Next time,
if you could just leave
a little note or something.
Sorry, brother,
i hadn't planned
on being such a slut.
I was worried sick,
you know?
Well, it's... it's...
breakfast, if you're...
( jack laughing )
Going to be late
for work, you know?
( Laughs )
( Sighs )
I don't quite understand
your schedule at intercomp.
( Laughs )
You need to shave.
You know, i'm not
going to ask you
where you've been.
Those bags
under your eyes give
the whole dirty thing away.
( Laughing )
( Laughs harder )
Oh god.
You'll like him, mother,
i'm... i'm sure.
He has a...
he has a certain...
( clicking )
...james dean
je ne sais quol.
He's... he's getting
quite good at the game.
You know,
the other day, i gave him
Alan ladd, bob cummings
and martha hyer.
Alan ladd, bob cummings
and martha hyer.
- And he got it.I mean
i couldn't believe it.
- ( Grunts angrily )
He couldn't...
you couldn't get
the grin off his face.
Who are you?
Close your eyes!
Close your eyes!
- Mother, just-Just...
mother, please!
- No, don't...
don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
( Grunts )
no!
( Silent )
Man in movie:
come in. Come all
the way in.
Upstairs, lock yourself
in your room...
( shouting angrily
in spanish )
( Rips clothing )
( Shouting continues )
- ... Pull all the curtains.
- ( Speaks spanish )
- What?Asshole.
- ( Continues in spanish )
- ( Shouting in spanish )
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Get the fuck out of here!
- ( Swearing in spanish )
Fuck you!
Get the fuck
out of here!
- ¡Loco!
- Get the...
get the fuck
out of here!
¿Qué, qué?
( Shouting in spanish )
Are you all right?
- ( Male voice ) yes.
- You want to go?
Please.
No, i...
i must change.
Woman:
you bastard!
- Hitting an unarmed man!
- Man: no, he'll live.
Jack carney.
Yes yes, please,
it's very urgent.
Mr. Leduc,
we have a room
for you this night
Near your mother.
Would that be all right?
Yes, thank you, that's fine.
Please go back to my mother.
I'll... i'll be
along in a minute.
I just have to leave
a message i won't be home.
Yes.
What do you mean
he isn't listed?
Of course he's listed.
He's... this is
intercomp, yes?
Well, he's an american,
part of your...
exchange program.
( Grunts )
Yes, i'm-I'm sure it's...
it's called
the exchange program.
He...
he... he told me himself.
Carney.
Jack carney.
I see.
( Heaving )
He's... he's lying
to me, mother.
He's...
he's spying on me.
He... he's not the friend
i thought he was.
And i don't know
who he is.
And one day he'll...
he'll go away.
Mother?
Oh, mother,
tell me what to do!
What's this?
For you.
A way of saying
"thank you."
You don't have
to do this.
I want to.
People like you
don't grow on trees.
I'll always want
to remember
How i met someone
like you.
You know
what that means?
It means hope.
Jack?
Jack?
( Keys jangling )
All right.
We'll see...
( muttering )
you think you can fool me.
- Ah.
- ( Box slides )
( Grunts )
You have given me
everything.
Just by being you.
Why do you
put yourself down?
Oh...
oh, i don't put.
I am...
down but happy.
Don't worry.
No sob stories,
i promise.
Down...
and happy.
Acting a great deal.
Not like you.
You...
can afford the light.
I belong in the dark.
The dark is safe.
In the dark...
i seem...
real.
In the dark,
my dear,
I have been
called things.
I've been called...
beautiful.
I've been loved
In the dark.
You are beautiful.
- ( Muttering )
- ( Clattering )
I know exactly
how long this is going on.
( Continues muttering )
- ( Door slams )
- Oh, sh...
- ( slams drawer )
- ( Keys jangling )
What are you doing
back so early?
- My mother isn't well.
- Oh, i'm sorry.
- She'll be all right.
- Good.
Hey, listen, i got
a killer for you.
You ready?
Huh?
Harrison ford,
- Robert duvall, teri garr.
- "Conversation."
Oh, shit.
( Sighs )
oh, listen,
I... i bought this
for your mother today.
I got it in san telmo.
I hope she likes it.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Jack?
You're not gonna just
suddenly go away,
are you?
- What do you mean?
- I-I've...
sort of got used
to having you here.
And i like you
to be here.
Well, i like it too, adrian.
What's the matter?
Well, i think i'm being
open with you.
- Yeah?
- I mean if i get
on your nerves,
You-You can tell me,
you know?
- Don't be stupid.
- I mean, i know i'm not
the best kind of friend.
I- I just can't do
certain things.
You don't need
to tell me that,
adrian.
No, i want to.
Things should be
clear between us.
- We have to get rid
of some of the debris.
- What debris?
What are you talking about?
What were you
doing in san telmo
on a working day, hmm?
I mean it is a working day,
am i... am i wrong?
Jack, i'm sorry, forget it.
It's me, i'm just...
i mean, we're all allowed
100-200 idiosyncrasies,
remember?
And i'm kind of wobbly
in watching my mother
fading away.
I can't bear it.
- Adrian...
- Look, jack,
I have to look
at you and be sure.
I mean,
if that is a mask
Take it off now
or keep it on forever.
If you want to keep
secrets, god knows
you're entitled,
But please just don't
try to confuse me.
'Cause it'll only...
confuse me.
What do you want
to know, hmm?
Come on, tell me.
Who are you?
Whoever you want me to be.
I'm serious, jack.
I'm terrified.
I don't want to have to talk
to the walls all over again.
Don't worry, kid.
I'm here.
There's nothing
to be afraid of.
- Say that again.
- What?
There's nothing
to be afraid of.
There's nothing
to be afraid of.
- You mean that?
- You betcha.
Now, come on,
let's go out.
- Out?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Good idea.
Where?
No, it's all right.
I'll...
i'll see you
in a minute.
Out.
( Door closes )
( Locks click )
( Siren wailing )
( Car honks )
( Church bells tolling )
Adrian:
it's five to 9:00.
Shouldn't you
be leaving too?
I'm eating breakfast.
I'll go when i'm ready.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Why don't we
walk together
part of the way?
Um, well,
i'll see you tonight.
Righty-O.
Bye.
Bye.
I'll just... i'll have
another cup of coffee,
( Softly )
quickly, why not?
( Clears throat )
I better go, really,
it's... it's late.
I'll see you
tonight.
( Door closes )
( Birds chirping )
( Footsteps )
Okay, follow him!
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
Just follow him!
Eh... eh, political?
- What?
- Political.
Look just go...
primero, you say why!
- Oh, god!
- * malvina! *
* malvina *
- ( Honking )
- * malvina, malvina. *
( Honking continues )
( Honks )
Claudia:
adrian, even the families
of the people
Who died under the military
have come to us saying,
"This man could be the one that
killed my father, my daughter.
How can we help?"
People from
all over the world
Are here to help us
unmask this man.
You're not listening.
Yes, i'm listening, claudia.
I just don't know what to say.
Don't you see
what this means?
When people get involved
and come out to be counted,
It means there
is hope, adrian.
Now, you're over-Excited.
Now... now you know
what i say?
Passion tends
to overtake reason.
Now, that's dangerous.
But it's happening
around you, adrian.
You're playing a part
whether you know it
or not.
What do you want?
You want to use my cinema
For films for your
little group, is that it?
All right,
you can have it, okay?
I want you to want
to give it to us.
It has to come naturally,
otherwise it's worthless.
Do you understand,
adrian?
No, i don't understand.
I've said you can use
the cinema.
Why must i give you more?
( Narration in spanish )
Woman:
please, can somebody
translate?
I don't understand
what's going on.
Interpreter:
what christian was saying is
That these films were
found almost by accident,
And show foreign elements
used here
By the "grupos de tarea"
or death squad.
( Speaking spanish )
Interpreter:
we know they're foreigners
And that they were here.
This film was shot just
outside of buenos aires.
That guy is peter alman,
a new zealander.
He died in tucaman.
The next one is an american.
And there are a couple
of south africans
But their identities
are not yet established.
( Outburst in spanish )
( Arguing )
Interpreter:
yes, let's try to keep calm.
Losing patience and arguing
among ourselves
Is not going to do
our cause...
let's concentrate on
these images, on those faces.
We have to put a name
to those faces.
One of them could be
the man we're looking for.
Ready to go?
Interpreter:
we have to find this man
And stop him
from killing again.
( Clock ticking )
( Birds chirping )
( Door creaks, closes )
( Phone rings )
( Outer door closes )
( Ringing )
( P.A. Announcements,
in spanish )
Nah.
( Laughs )
- Ciao, huh?
- Ciao.
( Speaking spanish )
Mother's voice:
adrian!
Adrian!
Adrian! Adrian!
Don't leave me here,
adrian.
Please help me.
Don't leave me here!
( P.A. Announcements )
...the fuck you're going,
asshole.
( Plane passing overhead )
( Clicking )
All of these men operated
here in argentina.
( Clicking )
Claudia:
hold on a minute.
Who's that...
the one
with the glasses on?
Um, his name is
michael weller,
An american mercenary.
Dead.
Dead?
Identified by his
papers and a ring.
He, like other foreign elements,
was passed off as a subversive
Rather than part
of the military operation.
Well, you know,
a corpse is a corpse.
And it was much easier
for the government that way.
If he was a subversive
There could be
a million explanations
why he was here.
If he was part
of the armed forces
There'd be none.
Why do you ask,
claudia?
Have you seen him
before?
No, nothing.
I thought...
i don't know.
( Baby crying )
( Drunken mumbling )
You fucking little
fucking...
bastard!
( Screams )
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.
( Sobs )
- Mrs. Treniev?
- Relax, ladies.
Well really, all i wanted
to say was that we're
very very worried
Because something is happening
in jack's apartment.
Oh, please,
speak spanish.
What is going on up there?
What have i said?
( Thumping )
What have i said?
( Loud thump,
glass breaks )
Tv reporter:
... male, dark-Haired,
26-27 years of age.
The victim bore
the unmistakable bullet
exit-Wound above the left eye.
( Man speaking spanish )
Reporter #2:
is there any real progress
in the investigation?
Claudia:
i am sorry, but i am not
a professional investigator,
But a member
of the international
human rights commission.
You see, when a situation
reaches this stage,
It is essential that
the populace involve itself.
For a killer to have
escaped detection for so long,
He must be living
and functioning
Within our
system freely.
We're not looking for any
particular face here.
There is no recognizable
look to the killer.
He could be anyone...
perhaps someone you know,
Someone in your family...
someone you work with,
Someone you trust,
Even your next-Door
neighbor.
Alberto:
laura!
- What's going on?
- Shh.
Remember the shots
last night?
We think that something
happened to jack.
- Who the hell is jack?
- Shh.
What?
Mrs. Treniev, you should
call the police.
Me?
Why me?
Because the lady
on the television said
we should all be involved.
You believe everything
they say on television?
Go ahead, involve yourself.
I'm not going to stop you.
But remember,
We could be making
a terrible mistake.
- I say we wait.
- I'm not sure i understand.
Are you suggesting that
mr. Leduc is a killer?!
Shh!
- But it's absurd!
- Absurd?
My dear,
The victim was
so disfigured
He could not
be identified.
They only know
that he was male,
Dark-Haired,
- And about 26 years old.
- Oh my god.
Let's not get
carried away, please.
It can't be.
The victim was found
in a hotel miles from here.
Oh, but that's
the simplest thing
in the world.
He could have
killed him here,
Cut him into
little pieces,
And taken him
to the hotel.
- Oh my god.
- Oh!
We are wasting
time, ladies.
One of us should
go up there and...
i could knock
at the door myself.
Oh.
( Chuckles )
Or maybe two of us, you know?
Show a little unity.
Just knock at the door
and ask for jack.
That wouldn't
be any good.
He'd just say
he'd gone out.
Maybe he's not in?
Shh!
He always brought...
the sunday papers.
Always.
And if he couldn't have come,
he would have let us know.
He would have called,
wouldn't he?He was that
sort of person.
He would have called.
Listen,
Let's wait until 6:00.
- If by that time...
- Vanessa: yes.
Let's all meet
at my place at 6:00,
Then we'll decide
what to do.
Oh, well, i think
it would be better
If we met at mrs. Treniev's
'cause i don't want to be
Running up and down
the stairs all day.
No, not running
up and down the
stairs all day.
Okay.
6:00 then, hm?
( Bell chimes )
( Knock on door )
Who is it?
Carlos:
your neighbors.
What do you want?
We would like
to talk to jack.
- He's away.
- ( Clamoring )
- That's just what we...
- Adrian: he's away!
You can't...
no, you can't come in!
What in god's name do
you think you're doing?
Get off me!
( Scuffling, shouting )
- Did you find anything?
- You won't get away with this!
( Shouting )
( Scuffling, shouting )
- Oh!
- ( Shouting in spanish )
( Scuffling
and muffled screams )
( Screams )
( Thumps )
( Women whimpering )
( Curses )
( Moaning )
Vanessa:
jack!
We thought
you were...
( woman sobbing )
Shh-Shh-Shh-Shh.
Mr. Palma:
i told them...
i told them to wait. I...
woman:
you never did,
you never did, never!
Carlos:
shall i call
an ambulance, jack?
( Door shuts )
( Sobbing )
I think we should all
buy him a little something.
What have i said?
I don't mean
anything expensive.
A gesture.
Something small.
I don't know.
I don't know...
some flowers.
( Adrian mumbles )
Such a... a ghastly...
all right, don't move.
- She just...
- Don't move, don't move.
- Maybe we should go
to the hospital...
- No no no.
Shh-Shh...
don't move, all right?
- ( Pained groans )
- Just relax.
You know...
don't move,
don't move.
She said...
said...
the place was
too clean compared...
- ( moans )
- Just relax.
- Aye-Aye.
- Just relax.
Shouldn't we... shouldn't we
go to the hospital for this?
No, i'll
take care of it.
Piece of cake.
( Hisses )
I... i just...
( church bell chimes )
( Bell chiming )
Is adrian in?
( Thunder rumbles )
I'll clean the carpet,
i promise.
I'm so glad
you're home.
You're my brother,
adrian, i love you.
I love you so much.
Talk to me, adrian.
You're making me
feel weird.
God damn you!
I'm sorry.
Don't be mad at me, okay?
Just...
just talk to me.
Just a little.
( Softly )
please.
Hey hey hey...
what?I just
wanted to say hi.
I'm sorry about my hands.
I'll, uh...
what?
I'll go wash up
and i'll...
i'll put the mask on,
okay?
And then i'll come back.
Okay?
Is that okay?
What about...
we're lost.
Oh bullshit.
What, are you kidding?
What, are you worried about her?
Forget it, man.
She came in here,
She pointed the fucking
finger at me,
And she said,
"I know who you are."
You're not gonna do
something stupid,
are you, adrian?
You're not gonna spoil
this friendship, are you?
Are you?
You need me, adrian.
Don't you?
- Yes.
- Yes.
And i need you.
So go have a nap,
And let me take
care of this, okay?
What are we going
to do with her?
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of her,
all right?
No, together.
I want to do it together,
whatever it is.
- Please.
- You're a little
squeamish, right?
Let me handle this,
okay?
No, this is my house.
It wasn't for me
before, but...
this is my house
and now i'll deal
with it.
- It's our house.
- Our house?
Yeah, it's our house.
( Plastic crinkles )
Bag.
What?Are you gonna
help me here or what?
Shh.
No no no... the trunk,
for christ's sake.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
( Sighs )
what a whale.
What do you think?
Should we
cut her in half?
Kidding.
Watch this.
( Bones crunch )
I should have been
a chiropractor.
( Speaking spanish )
( Jack laughing
and chatting )
Jack:
come on, come on.
Adrian:
whoa whoa.
I just wish we could go.
Hey!
Hello.
Hey, laura.
Can i give you a hand?
No, um...
thank you.
I'm off to california
in the morning.
California?
I'll be in touch.
( Laughs )
( Distant mechanical
sounds )
Hey.
I think the bitch
needs another bullet.
( Sighs )
( Distant screeching )
Oh, come on,
lighten up, will you?
( Loud screeching )
Jack:
on three, ready?
Come on, come on,
come on.
One...
two...
three.
( Rats squeal )
Oh shit.
Oh, well.
Never mind, come on.
We can't just
leave her there.
What difference
does it make, huh?
I'm gonna go
get rid of the trunk.
( Dogs howl )
You've done it.
You never have to prove
anything to me again.
( Sighs )
- Smoke?
- No.
You know...
we'd better think
of something.
Remember, i told them
i was going to california
in the morning.
Why don't we just...
why don't we
go to california?
What was that?
Why don't we just
go to california...
together?
Together?
Oh, adrian.
You know something?
I have never
Shared this
with anyone.
I mean,
when it was a job,
When i came here and helped
you people clean up
this country...
that doesn't count.
I was just taking orders.
When those bastards
fucked me up,
Nobody wanted
to take responsibility.
When it was over they told me
you're dead, you don't exist,
no one can touch you.
As if that mattered.
Adrian...
california together?
Don't you dare
change your mind.
Look, jack, this may be
an everyday event for you,
but for me it's...
oh, i know, i know.
First time for me too,
it was kind of weird.
I mean, jesus,
i was what, 17?
I was trained, but...
no, actually...
i kind of loved it
the first time.
Hmm.
You'll get
used to it.
Uh, can we go?
I think we...
it'll be dawn soon.I...
hm.
( Birds calling )
Come on!
( Keys jangle )
You need a rest,
big fella.
And so do i.
See you later.
( Water flushing )
( Door closes )
Hey, adrian...
guess what i
was just thinking?
( Grunting )
( Gasping )
( Cocks )
Do it.
( Shot blasts )
( More shots fire )
( Tv volume increases )
( Knocking )
hello?
Did you hear something?
- No.
- A shot.
- No.
- I heard a shot.
- No.
- Did none of you hear?
Mr. Leduc,
he was so depressed.
He may have done
himself harm.
( All arguing in spanish )
( Man shouts from above )
Vanessa,
¿qué pasa?
Oh, no.
No.
( Screams )
( Knock on door )
( Knock on door )
Yes?
I'm sorry
to disturb you.
I was just wondering,
Do you happen to have
jack's address?
No, i'm sorry.
Uh, we haven't heard from...
anything from him yet.
Strange.
Yes, well...
perhaps soon.
You know
who that was, hmm?
Silly girl.
It's okay.
You go ahead.
So you go ahead.
Go on, drink up.
Come on, drink.
I'm not gonna drink alone.
Hm?
( Flies buzzing )
Well, come on.
( Buzzing )
( Sighs )
You're making me
look silly.
Fine, suit yourself.
( Spanish chatter )
( Car starts up )
