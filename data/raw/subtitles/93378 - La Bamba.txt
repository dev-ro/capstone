Richie...
...time to get up.
The harder you work, the more you're paid.
What's hoIding you up?
Come on, we're wasting money.
''Don't you touch me,'' I says.
''I'm tired of being hit by men, aIready.''
So, I punched him.
His feet went up, and
when he hit the fIoor,
I thought he was dead.
I says to him, ''Sweetheart,
if you don't Iike it, you can Iam it.''
So he Iammed it.
Richie?
Bob?
Richie, you taking a break aIready?
So, Mr. Big Shot...
...you finaIIy showed up.
I'm Iucky I even found this pIace.
Rosie...
...this is my brother, Bob.
Why did you wait a year to join us?
Bob, watch it! My guitar, man.
Sorry, I didn't know that piece ofjunk
was so important to you.
I even sIeep with it.
It's no hoIe.
Come on.
Jersey Joe.
Joe Louis.
Rocky Marciano.
You okay? Can you move it?
You aII right?
Can you move it?
You've grown, cabron.
You're a big sucker for 16.
-What's the matter, you miss me?
-No.
You shouId have.
What was it Iike inside?
The joint is the joint.
Why didn't you come home
after you got out?
We haven't had a home since Steve died.
Don't be such a dreamer, man.
My dreams are pure rock 'n' roII.
-Go wash your hands for dinner.
-Okay, mama.
You IittIe pigs.
I'm going to teII your mothers on you.
Wait and see!
You teII 'em, Rosie!
Mom, what in heII are you doing here?
Working.
I came to take you out of this dump.
Not before we make some money.
I mean honest money.
I've been working.
Why can't you beIieve for once?
Mom, what's going on?
We're getting out
of this shit hoIe tomorrow.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, pIease.
TeII me you Iove me.
Why didn't you teII me
this was your first time?
You didn't ask.
You coming, Richie?
No, I'II wait up a whiIe.
You're reaIIy something, you know?
What's up?
I shouId ask you.
Wait a minute.
Did I horn in on you?
Just forget it.
I thought you'd changed.
Come on!
Come stay with us sometime.
Bob got us a house in Pacoima.
We couId visit L.A.
You'II be Iate for work.
My dad wouIdn't Iike it.
Come on, Iet's go.
I Iove you.
'Bye, Connie.
Goodbye.
'Bye, Rosie.
Rosa!
Connie, don't Iet the baby faII

Breakfast is ready. I'm off to work.
-Don't ditch schooI today.
-Thanks, mom.
Rosie, the baby's with the girIs.
See you tonight.
'Morning, Rosie.
'Morning, girIs.
Bob come in Iast night?
He doesn't spend much time at home,
does he?
You do.
Yeah, weII...
...I'm me.
Quiet.
CIass is in session.
Take out your history books. Chapter 7.
Who is the bIonde?
I don't know. But I think I'm in Iove.
Forget it.
She's way above your cIass, High Tone.
Just concentrate on that audition tonight.
-Hi.
-Hi.
They caII me High Tone. You?
Donna.
Mind if I waIk with you, Donna?
Sure.
I mean, no, I don't mind.
Donna. That's a nice name.
Look, caII me Richie.
This is my cIass.
Where's yours?
In the gym. I have P.E.
You're Iate.
Yeah.
'Bye...
...Donna.
'Bye, High Tone.
Say, Ed...
...you wanna buy a kiIo?
You did it, carnalito!
By the sweat of my baIIs.
You did it!
AII right.
Richie, meet Rudy.
He's Ieader of the SiIhouettes.
Look, VaIenzueIa...
...Chino teIIs me you're a hot shot.
What's that?
-My amp.
-Looks Iike someone threw it away.
WeII, it's mine now.
So, don't worry about it.
No Iie!
The pendejo was smoking weed.
He was smoking miIkweed!
I got him back.
Go on, Rosie, take a hit, man!
Put a IittIe mota in our Iove Iife.
Baby, I need some action tonight.
Come on, baby.
Rosie, come here. I was onIy joking.
Open the door.
Go away.
Know what? Let's get going.
-Go where?
-Home.
Other peopIe sIeep, you know.
You don't have to spIit.
Rosie, we're Ieaving.
I'm serious. Stick around.
Rosie'II be out in a second.
Rosie, come on out!
HassIe it out with your oId Iady.
I know what's happening.
Good night, Bob.
Come on, Rosie.
Open the door.
I said, ''Open the door,'' goddamn it!
Stop it. I'm trying to sIeep.
Open the goddamn door!
Leave me aIone! Go away!
Go get drunk for aII I care.
Okay, babe, you asked for it.
Our first gig's next Friday night.
Let me see if you're ready by then.
Right.
Rosie, are you okay?
Yeah, Richie, what do you want?
Nothing.
Sorry, my mistake.
No, Bob. It's no use. No more.
Don't you ever get enough?
Is this aII you want me for?
Come here.
What is it?
I made it. I'm in the SiIhouettes.
ReaIIy, mijo?
That's wonderfuI.
Who's the SiIhouettes?
This is not Iike I expected.
You are not Iike I expected.
I don't have a Iife here!
You're aIways gone.
Do you think I Iike being here aIone?
Look, Rosie, you're not my wife!
Stop being such a drag.
What the shit's eating you anyway?
I'm pregnant.
Aren't you going to say anything?
What's there to say?
It's not my first...
...or my Iast.
You son of a bitch!
What's going on?
Bitch! You bitch.
Is it my fauIt you got pregnant?
Richie, don't!
-It's none of your business.
-But I....
I am not your puta!
Do you aIways carry a guitar?
It's my future.
Sure of yourseIf, aren't you?
Yeah. Aren't you?
No, I'm the new kid on the bIock.
Poor IittIe rich girI.
I'm not rich.
Right.
My dad.
I want a pIace Iike this
for my mom one day.
Hi, Daddy!
I have to go.
Listen...
...I'm pIaying at a garage party tonight.
Want to come?
-Garage party?
-It's my big debut.
It'II be a reaI gas, kitten. PIease, come.
Okay.
I'II meet you there.
No probIem.
I wrote down the address for you...
...in case.
-'Bye.
-'Bye.
Who's the big kid?
A friend.
What is he, ItaIian?
-Mom, Iook at Richie.
-I see him, baby.
Mama, when's Richie going to sing?
Pretty soon. Now stop asking me.
We thank aII of you
for attending our dance tonight.
We hope you had an evening to remember.
So, untiI next time...
...speaking for myseIf, Rudy Castro,
and aII the guys in the band...
...we are the SiIhouettes,
bidding you a good night.
Goodnight, Richie.
What do they mean, not Ietting you sing?
Who do they want, EIvis?
No big deaI. I'II make them come around.
They don't know who they're deaIing with.
My granddaddy
was a fuII-bIooded Yaqui Indian.
What's the matter? Bad dreams?
I'm sorry, carnal.
I didn't mean to wake you up but...
...I need a pIace to crash.
No, man, here. Come on. Get some rest.
Keep your ass to the waII.
I'm so messed up,
I may take you for Rosie.
Where'd you get this picture of Steve?
Mom gave it to me after the funeraI.
I wish I couId have been there.
But he was your dad, anyway. Not mine.
Don't forget to turn off the Iight.
You been Iaid yet?
I'm serious. I know what your probIem is.
Sperm pressure. It's scientific.
You got hard-ons aII the time,
nightmares, wet dreams--
Shut up and go to sIeep!
A kid your age
needs an authority figure around.
BeIieve me, I know.
I tried to go, Richie. HonestIy.
-You don't have to apoIogise.
-Who's apoIogising?
My dad wouIdn't Iet me.
-Honest to God?
-Honest.
I reaIIy wanted to be there.
Cowboy PaIace!
I can't do it, honey. Richie's a minor.
He'II be singing, not drinking.
Rock 'n' roII to a bunch of cowboys.
My husband, Steve,
drank himseIf to death in here.
Don't you owe his boy something?
We shouId've brought Chino.
I need a drummer.
Screw the SiIhouettes.
I'II keep the beat for you.
They got drums inside.
What're you going to pIay?
Boney Maronie.
Boney Maronie? To these shit-stompers?
Howard, they're here!
Cut the jukebox.
Testing, one, two, three.
Sure good to see you foIks
out there tonight. Everybody having fun?
Turn the jukebox back on!
One of our IocaI boys is making his
professionaI debut tonight right here.
Let's give a great big
round of appIause for...
...Ricky ''Ricardo'' VaIenzueIa.
Howdy.
Here's one out of Lubbock, Texas.
Lubbock, Texas?
FoIIow me.
''You don't know
what you've been missing''
We were rocking, man, we were roIIing!
Didn't I teII you? We don't need no band.
We just pIay the bars with the drummer.
Me, for instance.
I'm taIking about making money!
I'm taIking about making music.
My music. That's aII I care about.
What you need is exposure.
A big pIace where you can seII
a Iot of tickets, put a Iot of posters up.
You gotta think big!
-You want to be my manager?
-Sure, I can do it.
I can get the American Legion HaII.
Steve was a WorId War I veteran.
What, you don't think I can do it?
Just for that you can be my fIunky.
Mom, thanks, but no thanks.
Anybody but Bob.
-What does that mean?
-Just take care of Rosie, okay stud?
Try staying home for a change.
Listen, punk....
-I don't need you--
-Stop it, both of you.
Richie, don't be so ''High Tone.''
And you Bob, you're your brother's keeper.
You never heard of that?
'Morning Connie, Richie.
'Morning.
You missed a great show Iast night.
Richie was wonderfuI.
ReaIIy? I'm not surprised.
I'm fIying this coop.
Catch you aII Iater.
I'm Iate for work.
What did I do with my purse?
''FIying the coop.''
That's it!
''Richard VaIenzueIa and his
FIying Guitar.''
-This is it. What do you think?
-This is beautifuI, man.
With some pubIicity
we can raise the roof.
You're dreaming, VaIenzueIa.
They wouIdn't even Iet us into this pIace.
No, I toId you.
My mom, she set it aII up.
Since when is your mama
running this band?
-We need aII the breaks we can get.
-I heard that. Richie's right, man.
No dice, Chino.
I decide what's best for the SiIhouettes,
and this ain't it.
So, Iet's beat it out of here.
What's his probIem?
Are you guys coming or what?
I guess it's ''what.''
What's going on?
Show business, mijo.
Show business? These Iook Iike shit.
A monkey can draw better than this.
Oh yeah?
ShouId have kept my mouth shut.
Every waII, every Iiquor store.
Every teIephone poIe in town.
Hit them aII! Now, tear buns!
We need a IittIe heIp
hanging that crepe paper across there.
Those chairs don't go there, FeIipe.
They don't go there.
You're Iooking reaIIy handsome.
The girIs are gonna go crazy over you.
-There's onIy one girI I care about.
-Who's that?
Nobody you'd know.
-Is everything in order in here?
-Perfect. Thanks, Rosie.
We're gonna pack the pIace, Mom.
I hope so. We paid for this pIace
with our rent money.
Someday I'II buy you
the house of your dreams. I promise.
TeII me about it. Where is Bob?
Three cups, thirty cents.
Here's your change.
Ten cases. Counting the door, that's $150.
We gotta do this again.
-Did you find Bob?
-What do you want? No.
-Did you Iook?
-No!
-He's pretty good.
-He's great.
What'II you have?
Can I have a Coke?
Here's a IittIe number...
...for the criminaI eIement here tonight.
And you know who you are.
Look at my Richie...
...shining Iike a star.
Look at Bob.
You're drunk, Bob. Give me that bottIe.
That's my brother.
AsshoIe!
Stop it!
Why, Bob?
How couId you do this to Richie?
To Richie? I did this to me!
That's my Bob.
AIways thinking of others first.
-Shut your goddamn mouth!
-Don't take it out on Rosie.
You don't understand.
You don't understand a goddamn thing.
What do you think,
the whoIe worId revoIves around you?
Is this where you Iive?
No.
I Iive down the street.
Hop in, I'II take you home.
Why don't we just go for a drive?
Okay, you drive.
What do you think?
Not bad...
...for a birthday present.
You say you're not rich?
My dad seIIs cars.
Can I heIp it if he knows his business?
He just didn't want me
waIking home anymore.
Because of me?
How come you've been avoiding me?
Is it that bIow-out at the dance?
-Don't be siIIy.
-Then what's the probIem?
My dad.
Does it mean I can't ask you out
on a reguIar date?
Why don't you ask me?
I got my own wheeIs now.
Who cares what my father thinks?
Get your ass in gear.
We stiII got a Iot of pIaces to stop at.
Look at this.
It's Woody Woodpecker and Buzz Buzzard.
This is the reaI stuff.
-They make cartoons out of these things.
-Can it, jerk-off.
It's kiddie stuff.
Finders, keepers.
Yes?
He Iives here. Why?
Happy birthday, mija.
-This man here wants to taIk to you.
-Hi, Richie.
Mind if I caII you Richie?
My name is Bob Keene, I'm president
of DeI-Fi Records in HoIIywood.
I don't speak Spanish.
But we can speak business.
Let me just say that I...
...I reaIIy dig your music,
and I'd Iike to record it.
What do you say?
WeIcome to DeI-Fi Records.
I work out of the basement.
This is your recording studio?
The Ampex is good,
the mikes are exceIIent.
What more do you need? ReIax, Richie.
This is just for starters.
I thought we'd start off easy.
PIay a few riffs,
move on to a coupIe of vocaIs.
Nothing heavy.
When you're ready, we'II record.
What? Do you mean today?
What about my band?
FrankIy, I can't use any of them.
Is that a probIem?
Yeah. They're my buddies.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Wait, Richie.
Wait a minute, man.
I understand about friendship.
I'm being honest here.
Not everybody in this worId
gets a shot at the brass ring.
You're going to have to ask yourseIf
what's more important, your friends...
...or your music.
My famiIy.
-Is that you?
-Richie, come here.
Did you trace this or what?
Trace, heII. This is free hand.
Look at this.
Art contest. $500 in prizes.
Think I shouId enter it?
Yeah, go for broke.
Fantastic.
I wasn't there when it happened.
But in the dream, it's Iike I am.
My best friend got kiIIed.
Got crushed by one of those
faIIing pIanes.
Where were you that day?
My grandfather's funeraI.
I guess his death saved my Iife.
Thank you.
My mom says it means
I was saved for something speciaI.
Know what it is?
Rock 'n' roII?
I'm gonna be a star...
...because stars don't faII
out of the sky, do they?
You think I'm gonna dump garbage
for the rest of my Iife?
How wiII you support the baby?
Drawing Woody Woodpecker?
I don't want that piece ofjunk in here.
Then to heII with you.
You don't respect any shit I do.
What about your respect for me?
I aImost have to rape her
just to have sex.
To her, it's dirty.
Look, Bob...
...it's cooI if you move in with me...
...but what about when the baby comes?
ShouIdn't you be with Rosie?
My oId man wasn't around
when I was born.
Why shouId I be?
-Figure it out.
-There you are, mijo.
Bob Keene caIIed me at the restaurant.
You're recording at GoId Star Studios
next Wednesday.
Right in HoIIywood.
Didn't you hear me?
That means he's going to put you
under contract with DeI-Fi.
Richie, I'm so happy.
It's onIy the beginning, mijo.
Bob has great news, too.
Come on, teII her.
That art contest? I won it.
$500 in prizes.
That's great, mijo.
With the baby coming and everything
the money'II--
In art Iessons.
See, they gave me a drafting tabIe.
AII our dreams are gonna come true.
I just know it.
Cut.
Let's start again.
Cut. Don't rewrite the song.
Just do it the way you did it
the first time.
Cut.
That was our fauIt.
Cut.
That's more right on, but that
''IittIe darIing'' Iine,
I Iike that better.
I don't see what's wrong with those takes.
That's how I sing.
It's gotta be cIean.
Each take has to be identicaI.
-Why?
-So, that we can edit Iater.
-This isn't Mexico.
-Who said it was?
I Iived there. I understand the tradition
of the song, aIways changing the Iyrics.
I've never even been to Mexico.
My music is my music.
You teII him, carnal.
How many more takes?
As many as it takes. Okay?
Cut.
That was good. Same energy.
Just try it again.
ShaII I get a new roIe of tape?
I think we got him.
I can cut something here.
Nice work, Richie. 60 takes, man.
How's the throat?
I think we got it aII.
60 takes?
I didn't hear a difference in one of them.
I'm ready to go home.
I want to discuss one thing with you.
Come here.
-What is it?
-Your professionaI name.
From now on, it's Ritchie with a ''t.''
R-I-T-C-H-I-E.
I got a new Iast name for you, too.
VaIens with an ''s.'' Ritchie VaIens.
-How does that grab you?
-I don't Iike it.
That's for shit, man!
VaIenzueIa was our dad's Iast name.
-You can't just cut it in haIf.
-It's no big deaI.
PeopIe in this business change their names
Iike they change wives.
Even me. My Iast name is Kuhn.
Look.
Trust me on this one.
Let's just go.
