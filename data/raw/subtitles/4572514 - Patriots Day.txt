How can we have zero hits on facial recognition?
Our technology is perfect of the government .

a pretty clear fucking picture.
One of the suspects is wearing Sunglasses.
- Let me pull the NSA system.

We need to get these photos
out to the public.
Not yet, We've a couple of descent leads here right now...
You Look at these fools?

You have no balls. 
I have plenty of balls. I'm not getting...
I'll go over there and say something.
You wanna get yourself suspended again...
If we release those photos now,
it tells the suspects that we don't know who they are.
And that puts them ahead of us.
It's true. But...
But what?
But what if we are wrong?
What if he's another innocent?
God forbid they also have to be Muslims. We'll be crucified.
They don't look like proto typical Jihadist to me .
What does a Proto typical Jihadist look like, Rick? You got a photo of one?

We owe people answers. 
We can't just seat back and keep analyzing data.
What is your gut telling?
My gut tells me that these are probably our guys.

Assalamualaikum.
Assalamualaikum.
You disrespect the prophet.
Waalaikumsalam.
Catherine.
Are there more bombs?
My name is Veronica.
I was born in a tent with three wars.
They said  UNICEF on the sites.
To a mother who could not write her own name.
You were born in a room full of flowers and balloons.
Your mother was a nurse.
- She calls you Cathy.
- You know nothing about me.
Your best friend Gina Crawford.
Works at a starbucks in Cambridge.
Where you tried to convert her to Islam.
- Between skinny carmel and machiato..
- You know nothing.
Are there more bombs?
More bombers?
You sent Gina a text, right after the bombing that said..
A lot more people are killed every
day in Syria and other places.
Innocent people.
Did you see the footage on television?
We found explosive residues from the bomb in your apartment.
On your kitchen table,
in your kitchen sink.
The kitchen where you make breakfast for your daughter.
Are there more bombs?
You met Temerlan in a bar.
- You're a self lawyer in suvac university.
- I want a lawyer.
Tell me Cathy, what other rewards for..
a Wife of a Mujahid?
If one's husband becomes shahid. What are the gifts bestowed upon his wife?
You might just not understand any of this.
- Are there more bombs?
- I want a lawyer.
- No. 
- No?
- No what?
- No,
- I have rights.
- You ain't get shit sweetheart.
- Are there more bombs?
- Am I under arrest?
- Are there more bombs?
- No? Then you can't keep me.
Sit.
Who the fuck are all these guys?
- Are there more bombs?
- You're crazy, You're batshit crazy, You know that?
You are out of your mind, Your fucking mind.
Cathy.. Your husband is gone..
Forever.
Sweetheart.
You are now a widow.
And have deserted your daughter, who will grow up knowing her father was a monster.
Stop!
He didn't even kiss you before he left.
Did he?
Cathy .. For the sake of your daughter.
Are there any more bombs?
For a Muslim woman.
Marriage is a dance of duality.
Strength and Submission.
Beautiful.
Selfless.
Rupturous love of two masters.
The Kernal and the divine.
The life a Muslim woman lives
is a dangerous and difficult one if she doesn't submit to her husband.
There is a spot reserved for her in the hell.
Yes, My husband kissed me before he left.
And he will kiss me again when I see him in Heaven.
And you can't prove anything, anything.
Mashah Allah.
Ya Allah.
Excuse me.
What do you think?
I think she knew.
But you never gonna prove it.
If there are more bombs out there she will never tell us.
How could a mother do that to her daughter?
Good luck Huh?
Tell me you have something for us because we're loosing daylight.
- And we have decisions to make. - She's not talking.
Mr. Governor We ran a gurdian search.
Black hat was watchlisted.
He was right there all along and we missed it .
All these guys, all this leads..
You see it Chechyens.. not Al quaeda..
- Not even middle east..
- Come on Ric, Fuck that.
We all had access to the same database.
I mean, who was looking for some narcissitic little princess .
Some whiny little bitch who've had her tantra because she lost a fight.
Everybody found out and beat up his girlfriend.
He's no Martyr.
He's a fucking coward.
Look here we block this street.
Look out..
Yeah.
- Ain't this shit is preventable?
- Preventable?
Uh..
7 years ago.
Yeah, much in level.
Why don't you go talk to her.
He said we could not have children.
Carol could not have any babies.
- Jesus, Tommy I did't know that.
- Remember after. right after..
On our way to home, park the car in the driveway and.
you know, make this kind of stuff up.
Right there.
Do you need any kids?
Cute little girls out there.. 
...planning to have scotch.
A little 5 years old girls.
I know we just sat there dead quite watching them play, it was like..  .
Jesus..
The sound that Carol made..
It wasn't crying, It was deeper.
Well, Crying doesn't describe that kind of sound.
I looked into her eyes.
That wasn't pain. More like war.
Like a war between good and evil right there, arise.
Like the devil was trying to go inside, but I'm fighting back.
I got you now.
that was hell maybe.
What could I do?
That's what I saw today..
Good Versus evil, love Versus hate.
Devil hits you like that.
Only one weapon you have,
to fight back with.
It's love.
That's the only thing he can't touch.
Where we hunt him down,
catch him, kill him..
All that, It's still gonna get us.
No way it's gonna be entirely preventable.
We have bombs around each other.
- The love power is fierce.
- I love you. Come.
I don't think there's any other ways I could win.
I always knew there was a thing of beauty.
Very deep in the holy soul of Tommy Saunders.
You know, 4 days ago.
You and I stood over the party with that kid.
Can't go back to all those families for nothing.
We are all better.
Bet I ran the marathon before you.

Two people took many days and weeks to plan out.
But love responded in an instant.
The bombs went off and wreath incredible havoc, death, and destruction.
But in that immidiate instant afterword
people ran toward us.
I first heard the term BOSTON STRONG about two days into the investigation .
And for me it was symblomatic of how
tough the city and its residents can be.
I'm a true Patriot, I really do believe in America.
And I think BOSTON STRONG,
its just shows that...
We are gonna stand up and defend ourselves. We're not gonna take it and be beaten down.
We're not gonna bother you, but just don't come at us .
because we're gonna come back at you.
When's the last time you saw crowds of people cheering the police on like that ?
They brought tears to my eyes, It relly did.
When we captured him, It was the best feelinig in the world.
As a police Outsider I don't remember having a better feeling.
Almost like we just won the war .
In the weeks after the bombings,
when we had the opportunity to visit..
many of the most severely injured Boston Marathon bombing survivors.
I was absolutely amazed by the strength and resiliency of the human spirit...
exhibited in these individuals.
It was absolutely amazing.
I think that day on  Wilson Street,
the bombers took lives and limbs.
They took some of our sense of security,
But they took a lot less than they intended....
And thet gave us back something they didn't intend us.. 
They gave us a stronger sense of community of common cause.
And I think we've seen that in other examples around the World .
When we see in the news that another attack has happened,
in Brussels, Islamabad, Niece,
Orlando, San Brandino, Paris.
I think it's important we think 'bout these peple around the world not as victims of violence.
But ambassadors of Peace.




You know, I have a tremendous amount of optimism and hope for the future ...
going forward with Leo. I hope that he sees the world with open eyes,
lot's of questions and a sense of humour.
This has been the absolute worst and lowest time in our lives.
As well as the best. It is bizzare that is to say.
And not that I miss my legs, I miss them everyday.
But after being the receipants
of such incredible care and kindness,
The very least I could do is get out of the bed and try again.
And try to make the world a little bit better for somebody else.
About 2 years after the bombing, I got a running leg and started to practice with it.
But I still didn't know I could get to the finish line until we took the turn on to Boilstone.
That was the hardest streach of the race , because...
It was running past the spot, where a bombing gone off and changed our lives
Took the lives of three others .
