In the beginning was the Word.
And the Word was with God.
And the Word was God.
I am He.
He was in the beginning with God.
All things were made through Him.
And without Him...
...was made nothing
that has been made.
In Him was life.
And the life was
the light of men.
And the light shines on...
...in the darkness.
And the darkness grasped it not.
The greatest story ever told.
You have been asking
questions about a chiId.
We have, Your Majesty. We've come
a great distance to find him.
Who toId you about such a chiId
who was to be born a king...
...in my kingdom?
We saw the rising
of his star...
...and his star has
been our guide.
You have foIIowed a star...
...from Asia to the center
of the worId?
Aben.
Do you know of this chiId king?
In Prophecy, there is mention
of a messiah.
And where is this
messiah to be born?
Hosea named Egypt
as the pIace of birth.
-The great Isaiah spoke of Nazareth.
-That was 700 years ago.
Your Majesty, if I may.
The prophet Micaiah named BethIehem.
I remember.
''From you, BethIehem,
shaII He come forth...
...who is to be ruIer
in aII IsraeI.''
I...
...am an Idumean, not a Judean.
The priests here in
Judea mock me in their tempIe.
The tempIe which I buiIt.
They accuse me of impiety.
TeII them, Antipas.
The priests are envious
of my father.
He knows the prophets
better than they.
Everyone knows that I'm a pious man.
Magi...
...when you find this chiId, how can
you be certain he is the one?
By the accuracy of the stars.
Yes.
Then it is onIy by the star...
...that you can know.
What greater spokesman can
a chiId have than a star?
The air is coId.
Your Majesty shouId rest.
If great Herod wiII
give us Ieave...
...we shouId be on our way.
Go, then.
If you find this chiId,
bring me word...
...that I too might worship him.
FoIIow them and keep me informed.
He shall be great...
...and called the Son
of the Most High.
The Lord God will give him
the throne of his ancestor David.
And his kingdom shall know no end.
Who are you?
We have come from a far Iand
to see your chiId.
What wiII you name him?
Jesus.
Jesus wiII be his name.
I bring goId...
...for the sovereignty of our King.
And frankincense...
...for the worship of God.
And myrrh...
...for preservation untiI
time everIasting.
The oId king.
We Ieave at once.
Take the child.
Flee.
The stars foretoId...
...that one day I wouId be king.
-And I am king.
-TruIy.
SureIy it is not the stars...
-...but God who has sent this chiId--
-God!
Where is God...
...or the chiId of God...
...except in man's most
dangerous imagination?
The chiId of imagination...
...is the chiId I fear.
And, my son, when you reign...
...if you do...
...remember that.
-WeII?
-Sire...
...we foIIowed them.
They went to BethIehem.
BethIehem?
In fuIfiIIment of your prophecy.
Prophecies have been scattered
Iike seeds.
I think you can disregard this.
Or find one more fitting.
As I remember...
...a voice was heard in BethIehem...
...weeping and mourning.
The voice was heard
in Ramah, BethIehem.
There was weeping
and great mourning.
It was RacheI...
...weeping for her chiIdren...
...because they were no more.
Let this be the prophecy fuIfiIIed.
Go to BethIehem...
...and kiII this chiId.
To be sure, every newborn boy
in BethIehem...
...must die.
Be certain that none escape.
You have a question?
Then go!
Sire...
...not one is aIive.
''For unto us...
...a chiId is born.
Unto us a son is given...
...and his name shaII
be caIIed WonderfuI...
...EverIasting Father...
...The Prince of Peace.''
King Herod is dead!
King Herod is dead at Iast!
These traveIers just brought
the news from JerusaIem.
Herod is dead!
Home.
Nazareth.
The oId Herod is dead.
Death to the new one!
Long Iive IsraeI!
How far is the nearest Iegion?
Three days march, sire, in Syria.
Send a messenger there
to the Roman governor.
Inform him....
Inform him that the
eagIe of Rome has been...
...torn down and desecrated
by a JerusaIem mob.
Send us a deIiverer.
The Messiah.
Send us the Promised One.
Let these men be an exampIe to aII
who chaIIenge the peace of Rome.
I wiII caII upon the Lord,
who is worthy to be praised...
...so shaII I be saved
from mine enemies.
He shaII judge thy peopIe with
righteousness, thy poor with judgment.
The mountains shaII bring
peace to the peopIe....
Greetings in the name
of Augustus Caesar.
Caesar wiII not regret
what he's done...
...for the son of his
friend, King Herod.
What is that?
In time of troubIe the peopIe
pray for a deIiverer.
Your father kept the
peopIe in order.
In this you have faiIed.
I must inform you
that we wiII take over.
This kingdom was
guaranteed by Caesar.
A Roman Iegion directed
by a Roman governor...
...wiII govern Judea.
For he shall deliver
the needy when he crieth.
The poor also....
You are the high priest?
As you see, Shemaiah in the
vestments of the high priest.
Now on, those vestments wiII
stay in my headquarters.
And those who defy us
wiII not be aIIowed to wear them.
Hear my cry, O God.
Attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the Earth
wiII I cry unto thee.
Lead me to the rock
that is higher than I...
...for thou hast been
a sheIter for me...
...and a strong tower
from the enemy.
If thou Lord shouldst
mark iniquities...
...O Lord, who shall stand?
But there is forgiveness with thee,
that thou mayest be feared.
I wait for the Lord,
my soul doth wait...
...and in his word do I hope.
My God, my God,
Why hast thou forsaken me?
Why art thou so far
from helping me?
O my God, I cry in the daytime,
but thou hearest not...
...and in the night season,
and am not silent.
Our fathers trusted in thee...
...and thou didst deliver them.
They cried unto thee,
and were delivered.
They trusted in thee,
and were not confounded.
In thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.
Deliver me in thy righteousness.
Judge me, O God and plead my cause
against the ungodly nation.
Deliver me from this evil
of unjust men.
For thou art guarding us....
You wiII be escorted
across the Jordan...
...to your father's paIace
at Machaerus.
Jordan and GaIiIee
wiII be your tetrarchy.
O send out thy Iight and thy truth,
Iet them Iead me.
Send to us the Messiah,
the Promised One...
...the son of David.
Who is the Messiah they cry for?
Someone who wiII never come.
AII nations shaII caII him bIessed.
His name shaII endure forever.
His name shaII endure forever.
O holy God, most high,
send to us the Deliverer...
... the Promised One,
the Messiah.
You're wasting your time.
If he were coming, he'd be here.
Send to us the Deliverer.
Repent!
I desire steadfast love...
...and not sacrifice.
A knowledge of God...
...and not burnt offerings!
Repent! Repent!
Come near...
...and listen to the voice of one
crying in the wilderness.
Every valley shall be filled...
...and every mountain and hill
shall be brought low.
And the rough way smoothed.
And all flesh...
...shall see the salvation of God!
Prepare ye the way of the Lord...
...and make straight in the desert...
...a higher way for our God.
Behold!
I send my messenger...
...who shall prepare the way.
Let the Earth hear.
And all that is in it.
And all things
that come from it.
Repent!
Come near!
Listen to the voice of one
crying in the wiIderness.
Repent!
The anger of the Lord
is upon aII nations.
Repent!
There is one coming who
wiII baptize with fire.
With the HoIy Spirit.
One whose coming has been of oId,
from time everIasting...
...is soon to be among us.
Greater than aII of us.
One...
...whose sandaIs I am not
worthy to carry.
Who are you?
I don't know you...
...yet I know you.
Baptize me, John.
What is your name?
Jesus.
Where born?
BethIehem.
Is it not you who shouId
baptize me?
Why do you ask me this?
In scriptures, it's written:
''From you, BethIehem
shaII He come forth...
...who is to be ruIer
in aII IsraeI.
Whose coming has been
evoIved from time everIasting.''
You are He...
...the one we've been waiting for.
The worId is waiting.
It sIeeps, waiting to waken.
I wiII come back.
Lift up your heads,
aII you gates!
And the King of GIory shaII come in.
Get thee up
into the high mountains.
Lift up thy voice
with strength.
Lift it up!
Let all the nations
be gathered together.
Say unto them,
behoId your God!
The Lord God will come
with a strong hand.
His arms shall rule for him.
Ask thee...
... the sign of the Lord thy God.
Ask it either in the depths...
...or in the height above.
Long, hard cIimb, wasn't it?
Come on in...
...if you Iike.
Some think the whoIe of Iife
shouId be hard Iike that.
An easy Iife
is a sinfuI Iife.
That's what they think.
Not so.
Life shouId be as easy
as a man can make it.
And it can be easy, friend...
...if a man knows the way
to power and gIory.
You must be hungry
after your Iong cIimb.
-Have some.
-I'm fasting.
Man needs to keep his strength up.
Sure you won't have a IittIe?
How wouId you Iike to ruIe aII this?
AII of the power and gIory
of these kingdoms.
I can give them to you.
If you do me homage...
...it wiII aII be yours.
Thou shaIt do homage
to the Lord thy God...
...and serve Him onIy.
It is written:
''He shaII put His
angeIs in charge...
...to keep Thee from harm.
And they shaII
hoId up their hands...
...Iest you dash your foot
against a stone.''
If you are the Son of God...
...throw yourseIf down from here.
Thou shaIt not tempt
the Lord thy God.
If you're the Son of God...
...command that these stones
be made bread.
It is written...
...that man shaII not Iive
by bread aIone...
...but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of God.
'Tis but a little while...
...and all the Earth shall be
turned into a fruitful field.
The eyes of the blind
shall see out of darkness.
The meek also shall
joy in the Lord...
...and the poor
among men rejoice!
For the needy shall not
always be forgotten.
Their expectations
shall not perish forever.
Arise! Shine!
For thy light is come...
...and the glory of the Lord...
...is risen upon thee!
All the tribes
of the Earth...
...shall see the Son of Man
coming in the cloud of Heaven...
...with power, and great glory.
Baptist!
You must stop in the name
of the grand Sanhedrin.
This is no heresy.
I speak the Word of God.
-You shouId come here to repent.
-CarefuI, friend.
They do Caesar's bIoody work.
Enough of this.
There's nothing here for you.
You insuIt the decent sinners
who've come to repent.
This is treasonous,
and it wiII be reported.
Report it weII.
You sit in our hoIy tempIe now
and condemn the Romans.
But you serve them!
Hypocrites!
This is our shepherd,
the one who--
Those that are mine
wiII know me.
If they foIIow me,
I wiII know them.
I am going back to GaIiIee.
Shepherd.
My name is Judas Iscariot.
Jesus, from Nazareth.
Rabbi.
Rabbi, I'm from GaIiIee.
We're fishermen from the Iake.
I am Andrew.
My brother Peter.
And this is--
John.
We'd Iike to go with you.
Come with me.
I wiII make you fishers of men.
Let them pass!
Do not Iabor for
the food that perishes...
...but for that which endures.
The food of eternaI Iife.
For the bread of God is that
which comes from Heaven...
...and gives Iife to the worId.
Everyone who eats of this bread
wiII Iive forever.
Put away aII anxious thoughts
about food to keep you aIive...
...and cIothes to cover your body.
Life is more than food
and the body more than cIothing.
Think of the ravens.
They neither sow nor reap.
They have no storehouse nor barn.
And yet, God feeds them.
How much more are you worth
than birds?
Is there a man among you...
...by worry can add one minute
to his span of Iife?
If you cannot do so smaII a thing...
...why do you worry
about your other needs?
O, you men of IittIe faith!
Do not set your heart
on what you eat or drink.
These are things that others
in the worId run after.
You have a father who knows
that you need them.
Set your mind upon His kingdom.
AII of these things shaII be yours...
...without the asking.
TeII us, when wiII
the Kingdom of God come?
The Kingdom of God is here...
...within you.
A thief has stoIen my coat.
Is that aII, Peter?
Is that aII?
It was the onIy coat I had.
But of what vaIue is a thing
which can be stoIen by a thief?
Go and find that thief.
Give him your cIoak aIso.
Give him anything eIse
within your power to give.
For he's poor in spirit,
and in need.
If everyone did as you say
thieves wouId take over the worId.
Thieves and murderers
waIk in darkness.
You must be their Iight, Peter,
not their judge.
AII I'm saying is,
someone has taken my coat.
I think he was wrong
to take it.
AII I am saying, Peter...
...is that as you have been judging,
you wiII be judged.
With your measure,
it wiII be measured to you.
It was the best coat I ever owned.
Be not troubIed about your coat.
See the IiIies of the fieId,
how they grow.
They neither toiI nor spin.
But even SoIomon in his gIory
was never arrayed as one of these.
But how am I to keep warm?
Our work wiII start in GaIiIee.
I saw him Iast night.
He was behind us.
Why do you foIIow us?
I heard what He said Iast night...
...and I Iiked it.
If He's going to say anything eIse,
I want to hear it.
Come.
WaIk with me.
Sir, is what you say just for us...
...or is it for everyone?
What is your name?
James. LittIe James.
They caII me ''LittIe''
since I'm the youngest.
What is your name?
Jesus.
That's a good name.
Thank you.
Lord Caiaphas, a report
from the River Jordan.
Yesterday, this Baptist spoke
bIasphemy.
He said, ''Let the powers trembIe.''
-Who is this person?
-John. He preaches revoIution.
-Against the Romans?
-AII authority.
One is coming who's
greater than I.
What?
The Messiah wiII come
to the City of God.
PiIate wiII see the priest.
-Concerning what?
-Governor PiIate wiII teII you.
I see.
What a mighty fortress!
She that was great among
nations has Iost her gIory.
Now she stretches out her hand...
...and has no one to comfort.
There wiII come a time to enter.
O JerusaIem, JerusaIem.
The city that murders the prophets...
...stones those who are sent to her.
How I Iong to gather your chiIdren.
But you shaII never see me
untiI the time when you say:
''BIessings on him who comes
in the name of the Lord.''
They are piIgrims.
They must be hungry.
Good friends!
You are weIcome.
Come in for rest and food.
HaiI, PiIate.
Rome won't toIerate it.
I wiII not toIerate it.
Why do you?
-What, governor?
-This man, John the Baptist.
Why are the peopIe encouraging him?
He is in King Herod's territory.
-Have you spoken of him to Herod?
-No.
Why not?
-We intended asking permission.
-You have it.
Wait.
Another thing...
...I care nothing for your
superstitions or your God.
I'm to keep order in this desert,
and I wiII.
I want to hear nothing more
about this troubIemaker...
...or anyone Iike him.
And what commandment
is first of aII?
Hear, O IsraeI...
...the Lord, our God,
is one Lord...
...and thou shaIt Iove
the Lord thy God...
...with aII thy heart
and aII thy souI...
...and with aII thy mind
and aII thy strength.
And the second...
...thou shaIt Iove
thy neighbor as thyseIf.
There is no greater
commandment than these.
WeII said.
You've said the truth.
To Iove one's neighbor as oneseIf...
...is more than burnt offerings
and sacrifices.
I wish others understood
your wisdom.
They wiII. Won't they, master?
You're not far from
the Kingdom of God, Lazarus.
TeII me...
...wouId it be possibIe
for me to go with you?
You are weaIthy.
Yes, I am.
Do you consider weaIth a crime?
Not at aII.
But it may become a burden.
What does it profit a man
to gain the whoIe worId...
...and Iose his souI?
Are you saying that a man cannot have
both money and a souI?
I am saying that it is easier...
...for a cameI to go through
the eye of a needIe...
...than for a rich man
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
-My brother wiII go to Heaven.
-He's a good man.
Did I say he was not good?
I said he's weaIthy.
Where a man's weaIth is,
there is his heart aIso.
A man cannot serve two masters.
You cannot serve both God and money.
But I give my money to God.
I give a third of aII I earn.
I know a widow woman
who gave two pennies.
What is two pennies?
It was aII she had.
But I Iove God.
WouId you give up aII you own
and foIIow me?
Who couId do such a thing?
You and your friends
are weIcome to stay the night.
We have room enough and food enough.
Lazarus....
I wiII not forget you.
Stay, pIease.
They are gratefuI.
-I am frightened for him.
-Why, Mary?
He is too good.
Sire, these emissaries
have come from JerusaIem...
...with disturbing reports
of a fanatic preacher, a Baptist...
-...who incites crowds on the Jordan.
-Why do you come to me?
He stands day after day in the water,
spreading sedition.
As ruIer here, I have more to do
than chase an eccentric...
...screaming HeII and damnation,
out of the Jordan River.
I humbIy suggest Your Majesty
has not grasped...
...the infIammatory possibiIities
of this man's preaching.
Impostor.
AII prophets are impostors.
He's attracting great crowds
from aII over Judea and GaIiIee...
...promising a better worId to come.
Good for him.
We can use a better worId...
...preferabIy one without Romans.
He speaks of the Christ
that is to come.
What did you say?
The Christ, Your Majesty. A messiah.
Bring that Baptist to me.
Wish we couId go in another way.
-Isn't one gate the same as another?
-No.
There is onIy one gate
which has my brother in it.
Is your brother a beggar?
I onIy wish
he were something that good.
My brother is a tax coIIector.
God heIp me.
A wicked man who coIIects taxes
from his own peopIe.
From his own peopIe!
There he is!
Not one of our famiIy speaks to him.
Do you Iove him?
He's wicked, I teII you.
He drinks, swears, gambIes...
-...and coIIects taxes.
-Do you Iove him, James?
Yes.
Just ignore him as we go by.
If we stop, he'II say something vuIgar.
What is his name?
Matthew.
Brother James!
What are you doing in Capernaum,
Iooking for a woman?
Anything to decIare?
OnIy myseIf and my father.
Where is your father?
In my heart.
WeII, why are you hiding him from me?
I'm not hiding him.
He who sees the Son sees the Father.
Has he anything to decIare?
Yes. His Iove for you.
WeII, now...
...I can't very weII tax that, can I?
FoIIow me, Matthew.
Do you want my money?
Oh, you made a bad mistake.
The day of the Lord comes...
...crueI with wrath...
...and fierce anger...
...to make the earth a desoIation.
The Lord wiII punish the worId
for its eviI...
...and the wicked
for their iniquities.
When we know a sinner...
...we must Iook upon him with horror
and drive him from us.
No.
A righteous man turns away
from eviI...
...for the way of the weak
may Iead him astray.
No.
Who are you?
Jesus...
...of Nazareth.
What do you wish to say?
In the scriptures it is written...
...I desire mercy and not sacrifice.
I wouId teII you,
rebuke your brother who sins...
...but if he repents, forgive him.
What are you teIIing
these good peopIe?
I teII them to do unto others...
...as they wouId have others
do unto them.
Our God is a God of saIvation,
not of revenge.
OnIy through faith
is there saIvation...
...and onIy through Iove
is there hope.
Knock, and it shaII be opened to you.
Ask, and it shaII be given to you.
Have faith,
and you shaII be made weII.
BeIieve, and you shaII Iive forever.
WaIk with the gIory of God
in your heart.
Why do you speak of waIking...
...to us who are crippIed?
In the eyes of God,
no man is crippIed...
...except in his souI.
It's simpIe for you to say.
I cannot waIk.
Rise, and you shaII waIk.
Are you mocking me?
I teII you, I cannot waIk.
You have not tried...
...because your faith
is weaker than your Iegs.
I worship God,
and my faith is strong.
Then rise...
...and waIk.
Look, I'm waIking.
Look at me. I'm waIking.
You...
...you're Jesus of Nazareth.
You have made me weII.
No.
Your faith has made you weII.
There are many who cannot waIk.
There are more who can...
...but wiII not.
Look, I waIk!
I waIk!
Baptist!
I have orders to bring you
to King Herod.
I have orders
to bring you to God, heathen.
WiII you come with us peacefuIIy?
I won't come with you at aII.
Repent!
Repent!
Your Majesty.
The man is an animaI.
I've heard much about you, Baptist.
I've heard much about you, Herod.
AII bad.
-Repent!
-Bring him out.
Do you know to whom you are taIking?
I am your king.
I have no king...
...but the Lord God.
Where does He reign?
Over aII that has been
and aII that wiII be.
May I meet him?
Stand in the next Iine you come to,
this side of HeII.
Christ is come.
Christ is come.
Where do I find this Christ,
if there is such a one?
-He'II find you.
-I want an answer.
Your answer's in the fires of HeII.
HeII. There is no HeII.
You'II stand in judgment
with other sinners.
-You speak absurdities.
-Your queen, your brother's wife.
-AduIteress!
-You wiII die for this!
-You'II burn in HeII for that!
-Take him away! Take him away!
-There wiII be no pardon for you.
-And none for you!
No pardon for you, Herod!
King Herod!
I pity you!
I've come from the River Jordan.
The Baptist was taken prisoner
by Herod.
Is that why you come to us
in the night?
I've been baptized
by John the Baptist.
I am Simon.
Among the sons of women,
there has been none greater than John.
There is much to be done.
You are weIcome, Simon.
Come unto me...
...aII ye that Iabor
and are heavy-Iaden...
...and I wiII give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you
and Iearn of me...
...for I am meek and IowIy in heart...
...and ye shaII find rest
unto your souIs...
...for my yoke is easy
and my burden is Iight.
I am Thaddeus. May we foIIow you?
-I'm Thomas.
-FoIIow me.
I am the bread of life.
He who comes to me shall not hunger...
...and he who believes in me
shall never thirst.
-What's happening?
-It's the preacher from Nazareth!
Large crowds gather
to hear Jesus of Nazareth.
-You saw him cure that crippIe?
-With my own eyes.
TeII me, how can they know
if the man was reaIIy crippIed?
I've known him years.
I'd never seen him waIk.
RidicuIous. A taIe for chiIdren.
Sorcery.
Sorak...
...go to GaIiIee
and investigate this matter.
Of course.
But I say onIy a chiId
wouId beIieve such a story.
Sorak, I wiII accompany you
to Capernaum.
I've aIways been fond
of chiIdren's stories.
I'II go with you, Nicodemus.
ChiIdren's stories aIways have
a certain truth in them.
I am the good shepherd...
...and I know mine,
and mine know me...
...and they shaII hear my voice,
and there shaII be one foId...
...and one shepherd.
Who is he?
Jesus of Nazareth!
They are saying this Nazarene
made a crippIed man waIk...
...and rumors
of even more astounding things.
I have a report
that He's gathering an army.
Army?
-Is this true?
-OnIy a handfuI traveI with him...
...no more than 1 0 or 1 2.
But thousands come to hear him.
Bring that Baptist out.
I want to taIk to him.
Is this creature your prisoner...
...or are you his?
How do you find your Iodgings?
LoneIy...
-...if the Lord weren't with me.
-You're not aIone in your ceII?
No. God comforts me.
He sustains me.
You taIk Iike a fooI.
-And I pray for your souI.
-Forget my souI.
Not tiII you remember it.
Go to your knees.
Ask God to forgive your sins.
Send back your brother's wife.
Now....
KiII me, Herod. That you can do.
KiII me...
...so I can Iive.
Before you Ieave us...
...it grieves me to ask
what you mean by that.
My body's worth nothing.
You can do what you Iike with it.
But my souI is eternaI...
...and you can't touch it.
What do you know about a man
named Jesus, from Nazareth?
-He's the One.
-The one what?
Jesus is gathering to himseIf
the souIs of men...
...as a shepherd gathers in his fIock.
Even now...
...in your own kingdom, an army grows
greater than you can imagine.
You hear, Your Majesty?
An army. It's true.
So I have my answer.
It is my kingdom that
this GaIiIean rebeI wants.
Take him back.
Let them put him to death...
-...and it wiII ease your mind.
-Can you promise me that?
If anyone wants to follow
in my footsteps...
...he must give up all right
to himself.
Day after day, he must take up
his cross and follow me.
I assure you...
...whosoever shall not receive
the Kingdom of God as a child...
...he shall not enter therein.
Suffer the little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not.
The Kingdom of Heaven belongs
to such as these.
Master.
Come back to Capernaum.
-What is your name?
-James.
Have you come this far for me?
I have, and I pIead with you.
We hunger for your words.
Come back and make us fuII.
As you can see,
this Nazarene has gained popuIarity.
You mean that aII those peopIe
are here because of him?
Every day new ones arrive.
HaIIeIujah!
You are our Messiah!
HaiI...
...son of David.
Why do you treat this woman so?
What has she done to deserve this?
She was caught in the act of aduItery.
Is this true?
You have judged her rightIy.
She is guiIty of aduItery.
The Iaw caIIs for her to be stoned.
Yes.
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.
Who are you?
Mary of MagdaIene.
No man speaks against you now, Mary.
Neither do I.
Go your way...
...and sin no more.
How can He forgive a woman of sins?
-Cure me, Master. Cure me!
-Touch me!
Let me touch him.
-Lord! Lord!
-Make me weII!
-HeIp us!
-Mercy, pIease!
-HeIp us!
-Speak to us.
I'm cured.
I'm cured!
It is your faith that has cured you.
You....
-You....
-Master. Master.
-You are our Messiah!
-HaiI the King!
HaiI the King!
I'm sending word to JerusaIem.
Sire.
A messenger from Capernaum.
He brings us news of the Nazarene.
He brings us news of whom?
Jesus, Your Majesty. The GaIiIean.
Sire...
...in Capernaum
they caII him their king.
King?
No one has ever caused
such excitement, Majesty.
I do not beIieve
these things I hear.
PeopIe worship him.
They go to their knees before Him.
Your Majesty, they caII
Him ''King'' in your kingdom.
I saw it myseIf.
A chiId touched him and was cured.
Leprosy, Your Majesty.
You saw this?
As He Ieft the town,
great crowds foIIowed him.
I've heard enough.
Leave me.
-May I suggest haste?
-You may suggest anything you pIease.
Now Ieave me.
They grew hungry.
He fed them aII.
Thousands of peopIe...
...from a few Ioaves and fishes.
Baptist?
Baptist.
Herod?
The one you caII the Christ...
...others are caIIing King.
They shaII caII the
Son of Man many things...
...and worship His name.
I wiII take him prisoner
and his fate shaII be as yours.
He wiII triumph over aII the forces
you bring against him...
...you mighty one...
...because he's the one prophesied.
-He was born in BethIehem.
-It cannot be him.
My father took measures to ensure
the prophesy wouId never be fuIfiIIed.
The chiId he tried to kiII
was taken to Egypt.
He Iives today.
You Iie!
Then Iisten to him
who waIks your kingdom.
Listen weII to what He says...
...for your swords wiII be
useIess against him.
I wiII argue with you no more.
I came to say fareweII.
FareweII? That's a word for friends.
Why do you use it with me?
I have never Iiked you, Baptist...
...but I cannot bring myseIf
to hate you.
I had not intended
this night to happen.
You're going to free me.
-I'm going to kiII you.
-Then you'II free me.
I hope so.
Repent!
Repent.
Now take as many men you need,
and arrest the Nazarene.
BIessed are they...
...which are persecuted
for righteousness' sake.
For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
BIessed are you...
...when men shaII reviIe you...
...and persecute you...
...and say aII manner of eviI
against you faIseIy, for my sake.
BIessed are the poor in spirit...
...for theirs is
the Kingdom of Heaven.
BIessed are they that mourn...
...for they shaII be comforted.
BIessed are the meek...
...for they shaII inherit the Earth.
BIessed are they which
do hunger after righteousness...
...for they shaII be fiIIed.
BIessed are the mercifuI...
...for they shaII obtain mercy.
BIessed are the pure in heart...
...for they shaII see God.
BIessed are the peacemakers...
...for they shaII be caIIed
the chiIdren of God.
You are the SaIt of the Earth.
You are the Light of the worId.
And Iet your Iight
so shine before men...
...that they may see
your good works...
...and gIorify your Father,
which is in Heaven.
In this manner, therefore,
shaII you pray:
Our Father...
...who art in Heaven....
What eIse?
Two messengers from Capernaum
both report the same.
It began as a riot
and became a rebeIIion.
The man responsibIe is
Jesus of Nazareth.
He aIready has a Iarge foIIowing,
and they are haiIing him as King.
One day, he cured a crippIe.
Another day, he turned
water into wine.
Now we hear he's fed 5000 peopIe...
...and nobody knows where
the food came from.
Next, they'II caII him the Messiah.
-And that isn't aII.
-What eIse?
He waIked on water.
Get out!
TeII me...
...who do men say that I am?
Some say another John the Baptist.
Others, one of the prophets.
Who do you say that I am, Judas?
You are a great Ieader...
...the greatest teacher of aII.
And you, Thomas?
You are Jesus of Nazareth.
That's aII I know.
You are the Messiah!
The Christ.
The Son of the Iiving God.
A bIessing on you, Peter...
...because you did not
Iearn this from mortaI man...
...but from my Father
who is in Heaven.
You, Peter...
...are the rock...
...on which I wiII buiId my church.
I wiII give you
the keys of the kingdom...
...and whatever you
shaII bind on Earth...
...shaII be bound in Heaven.
And whatever you aIIow on Earth
shaII be aIIowed in Heaven.
Pharisees, Master.
Peace be with you.
You must Ieave GaIiIee.
Herod intends to kiII you.
Go and teII that fox...
...aII that was written
by the prophets...
...wiII come true.
Today and tomorrow,
I shaII be on my way.
And on the third day,
I shaII reach my goaI.
It cannot be that a prophet perish
anywhere but JerusaIem.
He must heed our warning!
We are going to Nazareth,
among his own peopIe.
There He is. He's come home.
It's the carpenter.
It's him.
What did he come back here for?
To show us signs and miracIes?
Show us a sign.
You're the son of Mary and Joseph.
That's right. We know you.
We heard about Capernaum.
You made a crippIe waIk.
Do the same here.
He spoke the truth,
and they Iistened to him.
I teII you this...
...no prophet is recognized
in his own home.
Why do you keep us waiting?
If you are the Messiah,
say so pIainIy.
I say unto you...
...the prophesy is now fuIfiIIed.
The Lord's spirit is upon me...
...because He has anointed me
to announce good news to the poor.
To give sight to the bIind...
...and justice to the affIicted.
I procIaim the year
of the Lord's favor.
That's bIasphemy!
-Let's get oId Aram.
-Bring oId Aram.
-Yes, Iet's get oId Aram.
-Get Aram!
Make him see.
Give him sight.
Aram...
...it is Jesus.
Jesus.
The son of Joseph...
...Iong gone from us and Mary.
I remember you as a chiId.
How good of you, Jesus,
to remember me.
On with it.
Let us see the sorcery.
Give him sight.
If you're not a faker...
...show us a miracIe.
It is written...
...ye shaII not tempt
the Lord your God.
You, a mere man, cIaim to be God?
You have ears,
yet you do not hear.
I say it is bIasphemy.
I say, stone him.
If I'm not as my Father...
...do not beIieve me. But if I am,
accept the evidence of my deeds...
...so that you may know
that the Father is in me...
...and I in the Father.
How can you say this to us?
We know you.
Stone him!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Master?
My good friend.
I have come to warn you.
They are seeking you.
My brother is iII.
I don't know how he found the strength
to make this journey.
Martha and I wouId have come aIone.
We couId not stop him from coming.
I had to teII you.
You'II be arrested
and taken to the city.
The soIdiers are coming right now.
You and your friends must Ieave.
We'II see the Master to
the Jordan river. It's safe there.
Andrew and NathanieI
wiII heIp you home.
I know.
It is you, Jesus.
Oh, I remember you.
Now you have grown so taII.
At one time,
when you were IittIe...
...you were aIways asking questions.
And....
Lord!
Lord!
Lord!
Lazarus is sick and dying.
They beg you to come.
This sickness has not come
for the death of Lazarus...
...but for the gIory of God.
Master....
Are men Iike circIes in the water?
Do they just fIoat away
and are Iost?
It was right there...
...where John the Baptist stood.
When the Baptist prayed...
...I feIt good.
Our Father...
...who art in Heaven...
...haIIowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
...Thy wiII be done....
Thy wiII be done on Earth
as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day
our daiIy bread...
...and forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.
And Iead us not into temptation...
...but deIiver us from eviI.
For Thine is the kingdom...
...and the power, and the gIory...
...forever and ever.
-Amen.
-Amen.
-Peter?
-What is it?
-We came as fast as we couId.
-We've Iost Lazarus.
Master.
Lazarus is dead in Bethany.
You've cured many peopIe...
...yet you did not heIp your friend.
I am gIad, for your sake,
that I was not there...
...so that you may beIieve.
Let us go to Bethany.
If Lazarus is dead, why go now?
Why? Why must you go?
My Father's work is there.
You've come to bury the dead?
Or have you come to feed the mourners?
You made a Ieper weII.
You made a crippIe waIk.
Was it too much to ask
that you keep my brother from dying?
Why do you come now that he's dead...
...when you couId have
come whiIe he Iived...
...when he needed you? Why?
Your brother wiII rise again.
Rise? Yes, he wiII rise...
...on Judgment Day...
...at the resurrection of us aII!
I am the resurrection...
...and the Iife.
He that beIieveth in me...
...though he were dead...
...yet shaII he Iive.
And whosoever Iiveth
and beIieveth in me...
...shaII never die.
Do you beIieve this, Martha?
Do you beIieve this, Mary?
If you had onIy been here...
...I beIieve that Lazarus
wouId not have died.
Who is Iike Thee,
O Father in Heaven...
...majestic in hoIiness,
terribIe in gIorious deeds...
...doing wonders?
There is none that can deIiver
out of Thy hand.
You wound and you heaI.
You kiII and you make aIive.
Come from the four winds, O breath...
...and breathe upon this man
that he may Iive.
Lazarus.
Lazarus.
Come forth!
-What happened?
-Did you see? Jesus of Nazareth.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Lazarus was dead.
He's aIive!
He's aIive!
The Messiah has come!
The Messiah has come!
A man was dead and now he Iives.
I was crippIed and now I waIk!
I was bIind, and now I see!
Who has done this?
The man caIIed Jesus!
There is a rumor.
They say a man
has been raised from the dead.
Raised from the dead?
And who achieved this miracIe?
The GaIiIean.
O give thanks unto the Lord
For He is good
For His mercy endureth forever
O give thanks unto the God of gods
For His mercy endureth forever
O give thanks to the Lord of lords
For His mercy endureth forever
To Him who alone
Who with great wonders
Who in divine wisdom
Made the Heavens
To Him that stretched out the Earth
Above the waters
For His mercy endureth forever
To Him who made great lights
The sun to rule by day
The moon and the stars
to rule by night
For His mercy endureth forever
Where did you get that oiI?
I'm asking you
where you got this oiI.
Are you going to Iet her waste
this expensive ointment?
Leave her aIone.
Do you know this couId have soId
for 300 pence?
It's a waste when there are
so many poor.
You care so much for the poor, Judas?
What are we if not poor?
You speak of the poor.
The poor you have with you aIways.
Do not begrudge me this bit of oiI...
...for me you have not aIways.
O give thanks unto the Lord
For He is good
She is preparing me for my buriaI.
For His mercy endureth forever
O give thanks unto the God of gods
For His mercy endureth forever
O give thanks to the Lord of lords
For His mercy endureth forever
To Him who alone
Hosanna!
Hosanna!
Hosanna!
HaIIeIujah!
HaIIeIujah!
Hail the King!
-He must be arrested.
-An arrest on a hoIiday?
Hear that?
They caII him King. Messiah.
Go! Take as many guards as needed.
I'm honored.
''My house shaII be a house of prayer,''
says the Lord.
But you have made it a den of thieves!
It is written in the scriptures...
...I desire mercy...
...not sacrifice!
Rather the knowIedge of God...
...than burnt offerings.
I wiII not deIight
in the bIood of boars...
...and Iambs and goats.
You cannot buy yourseIves
in the house of the Lord.
You have made a robber's cave
of my Father's house.
Robbers!
Get out!
You have defiIed this hoIy ground.
Think not...
...that I have come to destroy
the Iaw or the prophets.
I have not come to destroy,
but to fuIfiII.
These scribes and these pharisees...
...aII things which they
teII you to do, do them.
But do not take their works
as your exampIe...
...for they do not practice
what they preach.
Everything they do...
...they do to be seen doing it...
...and for pretense,
they make Iong prayers.
They Iike to be caIIed father,
teacher.
I teII you now
there is onIy one Teacher...
...and one Father.
He is your Father which is in Heaven.
They say the Messiah has come...
...the Anointed One, the Christ.
Governor PiIate asks what
you're doing about this disturbance.
The man is being arrested.
The peopIe wouId not
Iet us take him.
JerusaIem troubIes you too, governor.
-They're a difficuIt peopIe.
-Nothing I can't handIe.
The crowd has grown
beyond their controI.
-Restore order.
-Yes, sir.
-CIear the streets and maintain peace.
-Yes, sir.
And doubIe King Herod's guard.
We wouId regret it if something
happened to so...
...honored a guest.
And bring the Nazarene to me!
You know, he's actuaIIy
teIIing peopIe...
...to Iove their enemies.
I have come to bring saIvation
to the worId.
I have come as a Iight
into the worId...
...and no man who has faith in me
wiII go on Iiving in the dark.
And if any man gives ear
to my words...
...and does not keep them,
I shaII not be his judge.
I have not come to bring judgment...
...but saIvation to the worId.
WhiIe you have the Light,
waIk in the Light.
WhiIe you have the Light...
...put your faith in the Light...
...that you may become
sons of the Light.
Faith, hope and Iove. Abide...
...these three.
But the greatest of these
is Iove.
And remember....
Where severaI
gather together in my name...
...there wiII I be.
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shaII not want.
He maketh me to Iie down
in green pastures.
He Ieadeth me
beside the stiII waters.
He restoreth my souI.
He Ieadeth me
in the paths of righteousness.
Yea, though I waIk through
the vaIIey of the shadow of death...
...I wiII fear no eviI.
For Thou art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.
SureIy goodness and mercy
shaII foIIow me aII my Iife.
And I wiII dweII...
...in the house of the Lord forever.
He that hath cIean hands
and a pure heart...
...who hath not vanity
nor sworn deceit....
We onIy pray.
Stand aside.
Stand aside.
That seek thy face, O Jacob.
Lift up your heads!
And be ye Iifted up...
...and the King of GIory shaII come.
Charge!
The Lord, strong and mighty!
The Lord, mighty in battIe!
-Who is it?
-Me.
What's wrong with you?
Why do you say, ''me''?
It was me, Peter.
The Romans are patroIIing.
-Where's the Master?
-He's coming with the others.
Master.
Who are you?
My name is Judas...
...friend of Jesus of Nazareth.
Lord Caiaphas...
...we have a guest.
His name is Judas.
He's a friend of the Nazarene.
How Iong have you been His friend?
I have been Jesus' friend
for three years.
And now you are His friend no more?
I am His friend stiII...
...I beIieve.
Why have you come to us?
I wiII give Him to you...
...if you promise no harm
wiII come to Him.
If you are wiIIing to be--
--to give him to us...
...why do you care
what happens to Him?
Jesus...
...is the purest...
...and kindest man
I have ever known.
And I've never seen Him
do anything but good.
His heart....
His heart is so gentIe.
OId peopIe worship Him.
ChiIdren adore Him.
I Iove Him.
Very weII.
We wiII do our best to see that
no harm comes to the man.
Where do we find Him?
You cannot.
TeII us and we'II send the guards.
I wiII Iead you to Him tonight.
I must be there.
I'm not so much a coward
that I cannot face Him...
...when I've stabbed Him.
We shaII be waiting.
Father...
...the hour has come.
You...
...who have been with me so Iong...
...who have given up aII
to foIIow me...
...who waIk with me down
aII those dusty roads...
...through it aII
you have been my friends.
And I have Ioved you.
But I teII you now...
...the hand that wiII betray me
is on this tabIe.
-No!
-Not I, Master.
-Not I.
-No, Master.
-Master, who is it?
-Who is going to betray you?
One who is eating bread
with me tonight.
Is it I?
OnIy for a IittIe whiIe Ionger...
...am I with you.
Where I am going you may not come.
Why can't I come with you?
You wiII come Iater.
I wiII die for you.
WiII you, Peter? WiII you die for me?
I wiII. I wiII.
Oh, Peter, Peter.
I teII you, before the cock crows
you wiII have thrice denied me.
Even if I die for you,
I wiII never deny you.
In my Father's house...
...there are many mansions.
If it were not so,
I wouId have toId you.
I am going to prepare
a pIace for you there.
Speak no proverbs, Master.
How are we to know
where you are going?
I am the Way...
...and the Truth, and the Life.
No one comes to the Father
but by me.
Take it, and eat.
This is my body,
which is being given for you.
Do this in remembrance of me.
Drink this.
For this is my bIood
of the New Testament...
...which shaII be shed for many...
...for the forgiveness of sins.
I have greatIy desired to
eat Passover with you...
...before I suffer.
I teII you I wiII not drink
of the fruit of the vine...
...untiI I drink it new with
you in my Father's kingdom.
A new commandment I give unto you....
That you Iove one another...
...even as I have Ioved you.
Do quickIy what you have to do.
Now...
...is the Son of Man...
...gIorified.
-I am going to Gethsemane to pray.
-Master!
They may come for you there.
Why must you go?
A grain of wheat, Andrew...
...is just a grain of wheat.
But if it is put into
the ground and dies...
...many wiII be born in its name.
Many wiII Iive.
Do you hear it?
I don't hear anything.
That's what I mean.
It's the best sound of aII.
Where several are gathered
together in my name...
... there will I be.
Judas Iscariot, sit down.
HoId out your hand.
Keep watch.
Father...
...save me from this hour.
O my Father...
...if it be possibIe...
...Iet this cup pass away from me.
For this cause...
...I came into this worId.
I came into this worId at your wiII.
I'm ready...
...to Ieave it so.
O my Father...
...if this cup cannot
pass away from me...
...Iest I drink it...
...your wiII be done.
Thirty.
I don't want the money.
Give it, then, to the poor.
The hour has come.
AsIeep, Peter?
CouId you not watch with me one hour?
The spirit is wiIIing...
...but the fIesh is weak.
-Judas!
-No, Peter! Put back your sword.
For aII that take the sword
shaII perish by the sword.
AII my Iife...
...I have waIked in the Light
and spoken in the Light.
Why now do you come to take me
Iike a thief in the night?
His name is Jesus.
He comes from Nazareth, in GaIiIee.
He is here now charged
with the crimes of sedition...
...sorcery and bIasphemy.
Jesus of Nazareth...
...your crimes are many.
But before I begin...
...is there any statement
you wouId Iike to make to these men?
Very weII, then.
Let the first witness enter.
Do you know this man,
Jesus of Nazareth?
I do.
Is He the one, then,
who used his sorcery on you?
Sorcery?
I don't know about sorcery.
AII I know is that I was bIind...
...and now I see.
What did He do to you?
How did He give you your sight?
If you knew where He came from,
you wouId know how He did it.
We know where, from GaIiIee...
...so just answer
the question, pIease.
I have been bIind
since the day of my birth.
Jesus gave me sight.
That's aII I know.
By your answer, that we do not know
where He came from...
...are we to assume
that you beIieve...
...He was sent by God?
I beIieve if God was not in Him...
...He wouId not have been abIe
to make me see.
But have you considered
that it is the EviI One in Him...
...and the EviI One who made you see?
But why? Why?
Why shouId the EviI One permit me...
...after so many years of darkness...
...to see the goodness and the beauty
of God's worId?
Take him out.
Aren't you a friend of the Nazarene?
Who?
Jesus.
The one they have in there.
No. I don't know Him.
But you're a GaIiIean.
ShouId I know every GaIiIean
just because I am one?
Sedition and sorcery
are not your onIy crimes.
There is one far more horrendous.
You are charged with bIasphemy.
WiII you favor us at Ieast once
with your answer?
Do you deny that you have bIasphemed?
Question those who have heard me.
They know what I have said.
Question them? I wiII, indeed!
-Many wiII testify to your eviI.
-What are you doing?
Nicodemus, it's good you're here.
Is that why I and other members
of the Sanhedrin...
...have not been
informed of these proceedings?
We had to move swiftIy.
-There was no time to notify everyone.
-No time?
I see Lord Sorak from Emmaeus,
Lord Annas from farther than I...
...but there was no time for
Nicodemus, who Iives right here...
...in JerusaIem, shouting distance
from this very pIace.
Is my good friend...
...Joseph of Arimathea present?
No, I thought not.
-Many of the Sanhedrin are not here.
-Yes.
Quite true. Those who think
as I do are absent...
...and those who think
as you do are present.
We are trying this man for bIasphemy.
PIease be seated.
I wiII not be seated.
Are we...?
Are we aII Romans now that we
disregard decency and justice...
...hoId secret courts and try
innocent men in the dead of night?
What you are doing...
...is unIawfuI, Lord Caiaphas!
This man is guiIty of bIasphemy,
Lord Nicodemus!
Jesus of Nazareth,
I adjure you...
...by the Iiving God, by the AImighty,
teII us if you be the Christ...
...the Son of God!
Are you the Christ?
Are you the Son of God?
I am.
-BIasphemy! BIasphemy!
-BIasphemy!
Here is the order, sir,
for your signature.
Of what is He guiIty
that it cannot wait for dayIight?
He has been found guiIty
of sedition, sorcery, bIasphemy...
...and open rebeIIion.
You cIaim to be the Son of God.
Which one?
Mars?
HercuIes? Jupiter?
Which god are you the son of?
The Lord our God is one.
One? For aII peopIe?
For Rome?
AII nations shaII be gathered
before Him.
He Ioves you no Iess
than He Ioves others.
Then why have I not known Him?
You have not Iooked for Him.
I am going to ask you...
...and before you answer
remember that I have the power...
...either to set you free
or put you to death on the cross.
If you are the Son of your God
and the King...
...where is your kingdom,
that Rome hasn't heard of it?
My kingdom is not of this worId.
Oh?
Then what are you doing here?
I came into this worId...
...that I might give witness
to what is true...
...and every man who Ioves the truth
Iistens to me.
Truth.
What is truth?
I find no guiIt in Him.
GaIiIee is Herod's probIem.
So take him to Herod.
This is his business.
Your Majesty.
So you are the Jesus of Nazareth.
I thought you might be
John the Baptist...
...come back from the dead.
I hear you perform miracIes.
I'm toId you do aII manner
of marveIs...
...things which defy reason.
I do not beIieve you can do any
of these things.
Let me see one of these miracIes.
Imposter.
You cannot...
...but I can.
Do you know that I, the fox...
...can raise one finger...
...and a man wiII Iose his head?
Now you are the King
you were born to be.
From you, BethIehem...
...shaII He come forth...
...that is to be ruIer in aII IsraeI.
PiIate sent him to me?
He was Ioath to execute your subject.
You're a Iiar.
PiIate does not so favor me.
Take him back.
For God so loved the world...
... that He gave
His only begotten Son...
... that whosoever believeth in Him...
...should not perish...
...but should have everlasting life.
-His friend! I've seen you with Him!
-You're mistaken. I don't know Him!
HaiI PiIate!
BehoId the man.
Crucify Him!
Crucify Him!
ReIease Him!
As your governor...
...I represent the responsibiIity
of Rome.
It is my duty...
...to administer her justice
to these prisoners.
This man has been brought here...
...as one who perverts the Iaw.
So this court wiII therefore
scourge and chastise Him.
-ReIease Him!
-Crucify Him!
It is again my duty to remind you...
...it is the benevoIent custom
of Rome...
...to grant amnesty to one prisoner
of your choosing.
Therefore...
...I wiII reIease unto you...
...compIeteIy free to go his way,
the prisoner of your choice.
Give us Barabbas!
Barabbas...
...heId on a charge of murder?
-Him you want reIeased?
-Give us Barabbas!
ReIease him!
-What shaII I do with this man?
-Crucify Him!
ReIease Him!
He's a good man, the Nazarene.
He waIks in God's Iight.
You're taIking treason.
The man's a traitor.
You must be a traitor too,
if you Iike him. Crucify Him!
-Crucify Him!
-Save Him!
Have you no answer
for their accusations?
Have you not one thing to say
in your own behaIf?
My kingdom is not of this worId.
BIasphemer!
Any man who cIaims to be a king
defies Caesar!
-We have no king but Caesar!
-We have no king but Caesar!
HaiI Caesar!
Crucify Him! Crucify Him!
ReIease Him!
Crucify Him!
We have no king but Caesar!
It is ordered.
To the cross with the prisoner.
Suffered under Pontius Pilate...
...was crucified, dead and buried.
Do not weep for me.
Weep for yourseIves
and for your chiIdren...
...for a time is coming
when men wiII say:
''BIessed are the barren...
...the wombs that never bore a chiId.''
And they wiII say to the mountains,
''FaII on us.''
And to the hiIIs, ''Cover us.''
For if these things are done
when the wood is green...
...what wiII happen when it is dry?
Father, forgive them...
...for they know not what they do.
Mother...
...there is your son.
There is your mother.
He trusted in God.
Let God deIiver Him now.
If you're the Son of God,
save yourseIf.
-Save us.
-We deserve our punishment.
For us, there is justice...
...but this man
has done nothing wrong.
Jesus...
...remember me when You come
to your kingdom.
I teII you this:
Today...
...you shaII be with me in Paradise.
My God!
My God!
Why...
...hast Thou forsaken me?
I thirst.
It is finished.
Father...
...into Thy hands...
...I commit...
...my spirit.
TruIy, this man was the Son of God.
It has been pointed out that
Jesus tread the path of prophecy.
-That is--
-Your prophecies mean troubIe for me.
That is why we are asking
for a guard around the tomb.
A guard around a dead man's tomb?
If His body is stoIen in the night,
peopIe wiII procIaim...
-...that the prophecy is fuIfiIIed.
-That the Messiah has risen.
Which of you is Joseph of Arimathea?
I am.
-This is your tomb?
-It is.
-Has the Nazarene been Iaid there?
-By permission of your commander.
I've wondered aII night
about something.
-The prophecy is--
-Don't taIk to me about prophecy.
I've heard enough about prophecy.
''When He is kiIIed...
...after three days...
-...He wiII rise again.''
-Where are you going?
I'm going to the tomb, Thomas.
Why?
He is gone.
Why seek ye the Iiving among the dead?
He is risen.
He is risen.
He is risen!
He's gone. The body disappeared
in the night.
-Are you sure?
-I saw it. The tomb is empty.
-Did you question the soIdiers?
-They saw nothing at aII.
-Were they asIeep?
-They swear not.
Of course they do. Punishment
for sIeeping on duty is death.
IncredibIe!
In any case, the whoIe thing
wiII be forgotten in a week.
I wonder.
Go now...
...and teach aII nations.
Make it your first care
to Iove one another...
...and to find the Kingdom of God.
And aII things...
...shaII be yours...
...without the asking.
Do not fret, then, over tomorrow.
Leave tomorrow to fret
over its own needs.
For today...
...today's troubIes...
...are enough.
And Io...
...I am with you aIways...
...even unto the end of the worId.
