I linger no more
I linger no more
those tears
I linger no more
my lord
o glorious king..
since you've built
this mausoleum
your slave is ready
to die for you..
the army is off on a
holiday, my queen
an entire army to kill
an unarmed queen?
I want to die at the
hands of my emperor
really?
not a chance.
why?
because..
I have promised my new queen.
who? -hey, what the!
my new queen in the city.
and this..
mausoleum is hers too
here..
jealous, are we?
go for it.
come..
here..
surrender.
what?
surrender.
they have no witnesses for
your earlier crimes
and section 396 will
get you only 4 years
you spoke to the cops?
krishna!
you hear me? did
you? -yes I did!
three days in three years that's
all the time I've spent with you
lonely nights kill me each day.
we lie on the bed
like dead body.
I can't take it anymore..
now I get it.
I'm such a fool..
what do you mean?
It seems like
my krishna has found
another lover.
look, I'll do as you say
If we don't come to power
in the next 3 months..
I'll cylinder for sure.
not 'cylinder' you
idiot, 'surrender'
yes.
smiIe..
you worry for nothing
so, can I go now?
what a strange tale this is
where does it begin,
how does it end?
what are these destinations?
neither of us can comprehend
why bro! -what bro!
this gentle breeze!
-and the hued skies!
my heart soars!
and my life too!
so lets fly!
where to? -to the
heavens above..!
do I Iook like a bog?
a eunuch then?
or maybe your?
brother-in-law.. please
forgive us
desperate measures
in desperate times
all your money is still here
2 million -all of it. count
it if you like..
you think I have the balls
to doubt your honesty?
I lost ice worth rs.15000
in my cold storage
15 grand!
If you wanted to steal the money
why did you blow the light fuse?
we would be caught in
the bright light!
anyway, the cold storage
is to freeze your money
not the bloody ice. -It's
3-feet-deep now, boss!
dig another 2 feet..
the deeper the better..
..for this rotten
uncle and nephew
they'll start stinking
in no time
show some mercy..
forgive!
I'm like a brother to your wife
so, I am like family!
please spare us in
the name of god!
yes, my love
save us sister!
only you can save us!
It's just some family feud
on the street, darling
you're back from your prayers?
allah be praised!
any last wishes?
wanna hear a joke?
a priest was fed up with
his female parrot
she was ruining the piety
of his household
even I would be ashamed with the
abuses this parrot spurted out..
he consulted his friend, a judge
he advised him to bring the
parrot over to his place
he owned 2 parrots.
what better cure than
good company?
these parrots sang praises
of allah all day long
overjoyed with this offer,
the priest brought his parrot
over to the judge's house
as she was locked in the same
cage as the other two..
the two maIe parrots stopped
reciting the prayers
one smiled and turned to the
other and whispered..
what did he say?
how do I say it?
what?
khalu you tell him.. -what
the hell did he say?
whisper it to him..
can I say it in your
ear? -come..
sorry, brother-in-law
lets go..
khalu..
I think we should kill him.
how can I shatter my
sister's home?
I consider him my
brother-in-Iaw..
even if he doesn't
I hope the ropes are
not too tight..
I forgive you. now set me free..
maybe we erred a little
too early,
but it's too late
to turn back now.
next time, you'll dig
your own grave.
get a priest along for
a proper buriaI.

hey feroze! babban here.
you've gone too far
this time babban!

mushtaq's men are tearing
bhopal down to find you guys
but brother..
I Iove my life. sorry.
feroze bhai.. listen! hello
scum, hang up.
Iftekhar? -oh, khaIujaan..
I am in jail right now
same oId case from 1984..
..keeps re-opening
every ten years
so you wanna hang with me here?
what the?
greetings, mr. mustak.
I helped you last year..
and your nephew made
my girl pregnant
wha.. what! -and you have the
gall to call me for help?!
shameless!
Is there any other number left?
not in my list..
now what do we do?
you're talking to the king
of nepal -asif nepali
just come here..
got it.
forget mushtaq, even musharraf
can't pinch your.. here.
It'll be safe to cross the
border via gorakhpur
gorakhpur
verma..
vidyadhar verma..?
let's just barge into his house.
he'll help us cross the border
rs. 263.
please give change
off they go,
where is vidyadhar
verma putting up?
do you smoke?
no
I do. want one? -no!
I want a light
but why?
because I'm thirsty, you fool!
how do I light this torch
without a match!
fool!
krishna! o krishna! have
you burnt yourself dead?
you have guests
who the hell are you? bandits?
no. -then?
thieves? -no, no..
then?
fool!
a gift for mr. verma
his favourite brand
-from my town
power horse rum
according to myth, 5 pegs down
and you'll snigger
like a racehorse!
we had become like brothers
in just 3 months
he had taken shelter with us
after killing that politician
so is he in the unclothed
or behind the veil?
I mean, is he behind
bars or on the run?
I'll make some tea.
but its time for rum
he's just a funny guy
the bathroom's behind,
the towels are here
I'll fetch some ice
for your drinks..
food is on the plates inside..
that can wait till
mr. verma arrives
when is he getting back though?
never.
the night burns ever so slowly
the haze seeps into my eyes
the night burns ever so slowly
the haze seeps into my eyes
through the nights, bit by bit
I've unraveled each new dawn
my eyes have, bit by bit
seen the break of a new day
moist eyes hold
the mist no more
the night burns ever so slowly
the haze seeps into my eyes
my vision holds the
fire of my dreams
and with this fire
I've illumined these eyes
what the hell is going on here?
what happened nandu? -khalu?
I hope you haven't ruined
the jaggery again..
taste it for yourself ma'm.
have you tasted it?
I was fine with it
the last time too.
can you please taste it for
me? -of course, why not!
allah be praised!
can I have some more? -sure!
what about you?
I don't like sweets.
then how do you sing so sweet?
sorry, I ruined your plant in
the morning. -doesn't matter
ma'm please check the sugarcane
I will
I'm so sorry about mr. verma
we thought it will
be sorted by now
then, what happened?
but he was always there
for his friends..
the house is witness
to his friendships
If you're friends with fire,
you can't escape death.
you guys are as apart
as chalk and cheese
worse. as apart as a
hindu and a muslim
I wouId be ashamed to be friends
with such a person
he's my nephew.
who the hell are you?
put that gun away!
not a gun, a pistol
a screwed pistol
fire and you'll blow your
face. give it to me!
how old are you?
20 minus 5
you know a lot about guns
In our village, we fire a gun
before we learn to wash our ..
It's badly screwed. give it to
me when I go to the jungle
my father will fix it.
later
hey, listen, listen.. wait!
what is it?
what is your name? -nandu.
you wanna ride with
me to the city?
after I'm finished cleaning.
you know the way to
the red light area?
It'll cost you
obviously I won't go
to a brother to beg
I'm talking about my money.
but I'm not doing it with you
bye.
one look at you
and I feel this way
that I've known you forever
only you
I'm sorry?
It's from the film 'only you'
composed by jaidev
beautifully sung by
lata mangeshkar
you seem to know a
lot about music
yeah!
my uncle was a tabla player
from the Indore school of music.
then how come you?
destiny
even so, I can play
a little bit too.
pIease keep humming, lest the
food become too spicy.
can you peel garlic?
-yes, of course!
we need to cross the
border, into nepal
now, without mr. verma's help,
It will take two four day
to find new house.
Is there a safe house where
we can lie Iow until then?
you can stay here if you like.
but? -and the safe house will
have no music to hear,
nor any plants to ruin..
the garIic, pIease..
that's my village,
across the jungIe
and across that lake,
the landlords'
we earned 6 of them last month
earned?
whoa!
a caste war has been
on for decades..
each caste has its own army..
even I will join very soon
you owe me 92 rupees
here's 500
tell me..
what will you do in
your caste army?
go down this road and
take a right..
..and return here
when you're done
got it?
I'll give you 100 rupees daily..
work for us
why don't you do what
you came for?
brother-in-law, do forgive us!
do what?
forgive..
just do what he's saying
where's the money?
Inside -spent
It was here! where did it go?
what! I took 500 from
it just this morning
and you are?
how about an introduction?
shaII I go first?
brother-in-law!
leave her out of this..
If you like I could
bury her with you
but with us dead your
money is buried too..
forever.
one last chance..
please..
sister! -hello? who?
lftekhar here
yes brother, tell me..
we are in big trouble
one little goof-up and he
wants to bury us alive!
what do you want from me?
It's brothers' day next
month please save me!
for god's sake.. -give
the phone to him
give the phone to
him -here, here..
yes, my love -look..
he's my brother after all
but, he's also wronged you
If you like, you can
Iet them live
or just kill them
whatever you feel like..
allah be praised!
I..
want my money back.
before brothers' day next month.
with interest.
you can run if you want..
but where will you go?
dubai? qatar?
kuala lumpur?
nepal?
I'll get you anywhere..
but not before I bury
one half of her..
in each of your graves.
don't worry. It's
just a small bruise
I'll just get you some
turmeric milk
where is the bag?
don't act innocent.
where have you hidden the money?
babban, have you lost it?
-you're the one who's lost it!
where could the bag disappear?
It was here yesterday..
there's no one here except us
there is..
nandu
when?
when you were busy
enjoying yourself
he was busy cleaning your room.
and they rape our daughters
and sisters
but, we are not impotent
anymore.
these guns are not merely
to hang lifelessly
on our shouIders
but for us to drag them
out of their holes
and make them pay
with their lives
If we have the courage..
which one is.. nandu's house?
get him over here
c'mon, stand here
who the hell are you?
I'm from haliya village..
hey, that's very close to
the Iandlords' village!
who told you the way here?
what's your name?
razzaq hussain
muslim, huh?
spill your reaI name and village
I'm originally from bhopal..
staying as a guest in haliya..
at mr. verma's house
honestly..
so, what's this mr. guest?
my pistol was damaged
nandu said he'd have it fixed..
listen, boy..
nandu has joined the army
get it? -yes, sir
don't even try looking for him
okay? -yes, sir
so, how's mr. verma doing?
he's no more.
don't you know?
have you run away?
hey, old man.. have
you gone deaf?
can't you hear me shouting?
-what happened?
what happened? ..happened!
let's pack up and
get out of here
this place is very dangerous
we only have shias and sunnis
but here, every bloody caste
has its own army!
and mushtaq?
we'll slip away so quietly that
he'll grow oId looking for us
and we'll grow old running!
so, you plan to lay a golden
egg sitting here?
mushtaq has to be
killed this time.
let him come!
wonderful, my heroic solier!
mr. Iftekhar
move your..
switch to top gear and
Iet's get out of here
you go, I'm not coming
why? what's the matter?
I can't have an innocent
killed because of me
Innocent, who?
love is really in the air..
stop trying to be a hero
why be a martyr when
there's no country?
you taught me. save your
own.. first, remember?
let the chick die if she has to
why care? -you may
not, but I do!
I didn't give you shelter
to put my life at stake
nobody is running, fighting
or doing anything eIse
without my consent.
aIways knew that you were a..
but you seemed smarter
as it turns out, you
are fool no.1
Innocent, ain't she?
why do you need firewood..
when there are gas cylinders
in the house?
where did you Iearn
to shoot like that?
not very talkative, are we?
I thought you stole my money..
sorry about that.
let's stop fighting for..
look..
my tongue ain't quite poetic..
so what's a good tongue
to make you understand?
so, whose idea is this?
why care about the tree?
tell me how's the fruit?
you may choke to death
you're pissed khalu
you're no fool just because
she called you one
and khalu, this chick's nothing
like what you think she is
nothing like what?
like candy floss, rose petal..
fairy queen..
khalu, she's a bloody
firecracker!
thanks to verma, she knows all
the tricks of the trade
trust me khalu..
she has a brilliant plan!
much obliged, madam!
thank you so much!
losers like us in your gang?
but, we're small fry
laptop, mobile phone..
or at best, a car
we dare not abduct the
neighbour's cat
and she wants us to kidnap
a bloody millionaire!
why all the generosity?
we're fool, aren't we?
are you listening?
fool!
sorry
he's had a bit too much
this night, the weather
by the river
this lively breeze
said two hearts in one voice
that once we meet,
we will never part
you're upset with me..
then why punish yourself?
just go away!
go where?
fine..
you don't have to listen to me..
but next time don't beg for
mercy at mushtaq's feet
It's not a pretty sight.
with mr. verma, my will to live
was also reduced to ashes
a Ione woman Iike me..
is easy prey for lecherous men
add to that, the emptiness
of this house..
I've often thought
of killing myself.
but somehow, it never
bothered me
that all I actually have
are two old saris
one bracelet and a few bindis
but since you've come
these things have
begun to matter
once again, I've found
the desire to live.
why didn't you share
the plan with me?
I linger no more
I linger no more
those tears hold sway no more
I linger no more
In the pools of my eyes
dreams swirled in at night
with a touch, they flowed
with a whisper, they said
trust not such flights
of fancy
so.. I Iinger no more
target is the plan.. the target
will tell us what to do.
mr. verma used his contacts
in the Income tax dept.
and put together this
list of targets
he was a true artist, mr. verma
but who among these?
-what's the ransom?
50 million -5 million
why 50 million?
2.5 for mushtaq. Isn't the
rest enough for us?
you think small khalu. It's
time for the big kill
Is 50 enough? not too little?
there's no dearth of rich
people in gorakhpur
ram prasad gupta
din dayal trivedi
prakash maroo
jaikishen kedia
or dr. aggarwal
they say, 'throw a
stone in the air..
and it will land on a
millionaire's head'
but the bigger the catch,
the greater the danger.
no no..
greed will kill us all.
let's try something smaller
so we get the money, without
risking our lives
okay, 50 cancel, let's
make it 20.
Is there a smaller
fish in the ocean?
what happened? -nothing
I said let's fish for
somebody smaller..
what do you think?
kamal kant kakkar
the smaII fish we
are looking for..
he'll want to eat dal and
rice, even in new york.
I toId him, we've got a 10
year visa, learn to eat pizza.
somehow, he's gone unnoticed
by the kidnapping mafia
but mr. verma was sharper
than that.
and we will do what
he had once planned
kukku! kukku!
your ad is playing on tv
so why wait! what's the deal?
because there is none
like kk steel
my steel
your steel
our steel
k.k. steel!
these bloody trade unions..
weapons
phone
cash.
and the right time..
where kakkar was,
is and will be..
we study every move he makes
all I've earned till date..
will be enough to
buy a used car.
we won't need that
we'll be tracked down
if we buy a car
we will steal one.
I'II Iift one tomorrow morning
I'll lift one tomorrow
morning no way!
If we steal tomorrow, we'll
be arrested day after
we'll swipe the car a day
before the kidnapping
and we'll steal it from
faizabad, not gorakhpur.
why?
so that we mislead the cops..
by placing hotel and petrol
bills from faizabad in the car.
so they'll keep Iooking for us
in faizabad while we get away
some tea for you?
why bro?
what bro?
flying too high, are we?
time to land, dear brother
we've only 12 days left
'monday'
'tuesday'
he's here
now tell me the car number
'wednesday'
'thursday'
four days left
but brother's day is 6 days away
but your funeral is 4 days away
my niece gets married
day after in lucknow
I'll look you up right
after. -but, sir..
'friday'
the chinese have taken
over the market
'saturday'
we should've just run away
but your common sense
was on a stroll
doesn't look like we'll
ever find kakkar aIone.
and your brother-in-law is
dying to give us a funeral
kakkar goes to the temple at 8
and reaches the factory by 11..
considering it's just
a half hour drive
what keeps him in the
temple for so long?
hello babban? hey!
sir.. sir, my phone fallen down.
one minute, stop.
who's that?
who the hell is this?
where're you mamta?
come my beloved.
I have reached the
prime of youth.
I'm waiting for you come soon.
say something please
come my beloved.
I have reached the
prime of youth.
you're my sIave.
let's put your strength to test!
so, can you quench my thirst?
no, no
I can't be unfaithful to mamta
what about now? -no way.
now? now? now? -no, no, no.
mamta, it's you!
you win..
I lose
your love for me is eternal
now will you quench my thirst?
sweetheart!
my darling!
this feels good.
the world thinks he
visits the temple
but the rituals take place
in the beauty parlour
we couldn't have found a
better place for our job
let's head to faizabad
tomorrow for the car.
was there anyone else there?
who?
the lady with the whip
lady who?
what happened!
what's so funny?
what happened?
I can't be unfaithful
to mamta -mamta who?
hey uncle, is this your
phone? yes it is
it fell down inside. thanks
a lot It's been an hour.
thank you very much.
baban!
It's been an hour. are you
laying eggs in there?
counting chikens.
khalujaan, breakfast
please don't call me khalujaan
why not? It's such a nice name
khalu means uncle
I feel old every time you say it.
my name is Iftekhar
that sounds even older
so then..
let's cut out the khalu
and stick with the
jaan (beloved)
what?
khalu I can't go
why?
my tummy's all screwed up
this was the 4th time already
you're an expert in
stealing cars anyway
Its too risky alone
shouId I come along then?
I'll be ready in a minute
I'll give you a pill
and you'll be fine.
feeling any better?
you'll soon be better
If krishna has said
it, it will be true
just a few more days..
and we'll be back home..
with the sun shining out of
our.. by the riverside
It's so cool out here.
shouId we ask krishna
to come along?
to the riverside?
no, to the village
better than being aIone here
there she'll have me and you
and soon you'll be married too
we'll tell her, live with us
live with me
are you alright?
It hurts too much! -where
are you off to?
can't heIp it
we'll miss the bus
we don't have time for this
our bus is about to leave
things are way beyond my control
hang on to it..
you can continue in faizabad
come out.
hey uncle, time to go!
hang on, just a minute
our bus is leaving you idiot!
come on. -I'm coming.
come and sit.
the sight of her binds me
and I can't look away
this silky strand I
can't tear away
It's been years since
I've turned grey
yet the color of youth
refuses to fade away
oh! and now my heart
beats faster
my face is losing its colour
I fear those lonely nights
my heart is but a child
my heart is but a child
Innocent but naive
my heart is but a child
the sight of her binds me
and I can't look away
this silky strand I
can't tear away
It's been years since
I've turned grey
yet the color of youth
refuses to fade away
who knew I'd given shelter
to such a roguish heart
forever I imagined it would be
as virtuous as me
oh! and it pulls at me
It makes such a racket
It gives undue importance
to trivial things
nothing's more devious
than the heart
someone stop me
someone hold me
or eIse at this age
I will be deceived
and now I fear I'll
fall in love
my heart is but a child
my heart is but a child
Innocent but naive
my heart is but a child
how do I look?
like a fool..
you like this better?
my heart is but a child
my heart is but a child
Innocent but naive
my heart is but a child
get dressed..
khalujaan will be
here any minute
screw that..
I'm not going anywhere
you will have to
I'm staying right here
here?
forever?
and what will you do here?
marry you
marry me?
no, the lady with the torch
I saw you girl and played
my heart's guitar
I saw you girl and played
my heart's guitar
love-drops from your eyes
and played my heart's guitar
drunkenness is all around
life is fun fun fun
hey hey here i go
and my heart goes with me
hey hey here i go
and my heart goes with me
when will you be back?
In a couple of days
didn't realize when you
got back last night.

no body can dare to entering
in your dream.

you're part of my life.
what's wrong with you khalu?
truth is a bitter pill.
takes time to swallow
what truth?
sorry khalu
by the time I knew
of your intentions
I had already slipped
I was wondering whether
to tell you or not
In a way its good you know
fate has sorted it out.
now just get us married
If not krishna, you can atleast
play with her kids
what are you doing?
don't annoy me
hey!
Is it hurting a lot? so sorry
you piece of! you deserve
to be in the gutters
your father had eloped with
the priest's daughter
If I hadn't raised you
you'd still be a dog in
the bylanes of aligarh
and you?
If not for me
you'd still be licking
mushtaq's feet
I've raised you like
my own son, you!
like your own son? you couIdn't
even get me married
couldn't raise enough
for the priest
the wedding party
had to turn back
nobody wanted a whoring
..for a son-in-law
they figured both of
you out quite earIy
both who?
you
and?
and your mother
I warn you khalu
don't drag my mother into this
-I'm dragging nobody..
the whole world says it.
says what?
the whoring son of a
flirtatious mother
where's vidya?
who?
my beloved husband
vidyadhar verma
krishna!
you immersed his ashes
in the ganges yourself
I've told you before
that he's dead
you are delusional.
call him
come on
have you gone mad?
'dreaded criminal verma dies in
gas cylinder explosion at home'
you're free to go
you can catch the evening
train to bhopal
where's kakkar?
It's about 2.5 million
perhaps not enough for you
but enough to repay your debt
please count it
we used to count it
everyday before it was stolen
that's all we did day and night
I could've run away
with the money
you would've never found me
but I don't want the money
-you want more money
she's turned out to be
the mother of all
still wanna marry her?
and have your kids
play in my lap?
the sooner you leave
this place..
..the better -better!
before we leave
may we know your reason
for doing this?
love has no reasons.
this bag is torn
Is there another one?
that one?
where's kakkar?
where is he?
where the hell is he?
must be in the house somewhere.
let's go look
you go khalu
you're making a big mistake
kakkar is a dangerous man
his steel business is a cover
to smuggle arms from nepal
really?
kakkar is verma's right
hand man -'Is'?
you mean verma is alive?
yes
and they tried to kill me.
and they failed?
awesome!
there's very little time left
leave with the money or you'll
get killed with me
verma will be here soon
and why have you
called him here?
last night, as you slept
I sat watching you all night
you're the first
woman I've loved
and you!
you were playing games with me?
baban!
don't know where the
..has hidden him..
baban!
I knew her husband rather well
he was a big time crook
he would try to extort
money from me too
but sir..
even he never asked for so much
I mean, I have money
but I can't just snap my fingers
and get 40 million
40 million?
didn't we fix on 20?
but I've offered 25 myself
verma was your business partner?
business?
what business sir?
arms smuggling from nepal?
sir..
I don't know what relationship
you all share
I've nothing more to
say in my defense
sir..
just tell me what you
want me to do..
how long to arrange 25 million?
hello -mamta?
but I..
her hands were busy, so I..
put it on speaker -ok
no, no mamta, don't!
yes kukku?
I need some cash urgently
why? you've been kidnapped?
no, no! Income tax
understand!
listen carefully
take 15 million from the fridge
and 10 from the microwave..
and get to the factory quickly
men from the Income tax dept.
will come in an hour
kuku, you're..
oh! don't worry about me
I'll be home by evening
let's go
and kakkar?
have locked him in the temple.
they'll find him.
khaIu..
she knows everything about us
she might tell the cops..
what do we do?
what else?
kill her
khaIu, you kill her.. -why?
what why? kill her!
but why don't you kill her?
why don't you?
because I've fallen
in love with the..
this is great
when you do it, it's love
when I do it, it's sex
nandu!
at least count it
no it's fine
you're just like family
It's fine
mr. verma -I'm no longer verma
I'm kulshreshtha. shyam
prasad kulshreshtha
I swear to god, mr. verma.. er..
I mean mr. kulshreshtha
If we had any idea we would
not get involved
If it wasn't for mushtaq's
sword hanging over us
we would've left long ago
right babban? -yes.
all right.. I'll go
meet her myself
so we'II take your leave? -why?
don't wanna see her
one last time?
let's go
come..
where are you taking us?
huh?
have we reached?
yes, yes.. please..
where are you taking us?
come out here
where have you brought us?
hey! not another word from you!
bro, you're here, right?
I'm right here
It's time we start praying..
hey! how far is it?
you want to kill us
by making us waIk?
sorry for raising my hand on you
no.. no.. It's ok
I just wanted to say..
hey! what are you doing?
-stop pushing!
you wanted to know
what I would do in the army
check this out
chinese pistol
verma sent you to kill us?
I was to dump your bodies
in this river
was my first solo job
you always knew that
verma is alive?
no saw him when I went to the
jungle to meet my father
thought I'd seen a ghost
then later, people told
me the whole story
what did they tell you?
when they got married..
varma had promised krishna..
that he'll leave his
criminal ways..
forever..
but he didn't
he loved her for sure..
but not more than his weapons
her stubbornness began
getting in his way
he wanted to be free..
..from the police and krishna
and for his rebirth, varma
orchestrated his own death
varma did a lot for our caste..
..but for what he
did to krishna,
I can never forgive him
that's why I'm letting you go
no conflict is deeper than the
one between husband and wife
It's by god's grace
that she survived
will he help her again?
she's alone against
verma and his goons
you have her all tied up.
she can't even escape
screw it. what's it to us?
kukku, kukku!
kukku!
where are you?
kukku!
kukku!
kukku!
and I slapped her twice!
you are a woman, behave
like one..
else go sit on your
father's head..
we've to put them in their place
hey you, stop! you
dare attack cops?
I..
was happy to hear that..
that night.. you survived.
how did you find out?
moustache?
you ook like a chick
how did you find out?
you stubborn girl
you never understood..
the army depended on me, no?
I couIdn't have run
away like a coward
for your sake..
and you?
surrender, surrender
not 'surrender', 'cylinder'
that night the gas cyIinder
was empty..
the cops insisted
that I'm mistaken
but when I searched the corpse..
your corpse
then I was certain
ask me how
you hated me so much?
I hated you?
so you think whatever
I did that night..
was because I hated you?
I couldn't live with
you or without you
you could've taken me along -as
if you wouId've come happily?
you could've abducted me..
abducted you?
you're my wife, godammit!
you should've come
along on your own
come on now, let's go..
we'll go, we'll go together
my emperor and his queen
will be buried in this
mausoIeum together
no krishna -no!
no krishna no!
mr. kakkar, there are gas
cylinders in the house
she wants to blow the house up
check it out.
don't just stand there!
listen to me..
krishna!
you're scaring me
put it on speaker
hello! hello!
yes my love
I've been trying to phone
for past two days.
what are you upto?
thinking of you, what else?
shut up, Iiar!
and your sinners?
Is it fine?
they've ditched me again
oh god!
you are a kid at heart. want
to play police-thief?
next time, show no
mercy whatsoever
where do I find them, my love?
how do I find them?
