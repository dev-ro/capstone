Alright it's the final match of
the season ladies and gentlemen...
And as we approach the finish...
it's still not clear which team
is going to lift the Champions Cup...
Two minutes to go... and
the score stands at 1 all...
The Rangers have the ball
and are dribbling through...
Is this going to be a goal?
But just as I say that Dev
Saran has intercepted them...
and has possession.
My God! Look at him go...
He's moving closer and
closer to the goal...
Just look at him go. Dev
Saran looks determined...
Is this going to be the decider?
Oh my God! He's under the D... he's
through... he's through them all...
Is that going to be a penalty? That
definitely should be a penalty...
If that's a penalty... the Rangers
probably just threw the game away...
Good morning Sir. The
limousine is ready for the wedding.
What wedding?
Your wedding Sir...
Shit! Maya's going to kill me...
Maya... Maya... Come on hurry up...
The groom will be here at one...
Yes... I'm married...
and I have a son...
And just to make it clear...
I keep my personal life and
professional life separate...
That's all very well Mrs. Saran...
But our fashion magazine
needs a lot of time...
Your magazine does not
need time... It needs me!
One minute to go and
it's all-or-death scenario.
If he gets it he will take
his team into the finals..
And himself into the A-league.
- Yes?
- Who are you?
Whoever you want me to be honey...
Dad! Dad!
- Hey...
- Dude... What are you doing?
Sorry son... Just a little...
tied up...
Oh God... da...
And how did this break?
I'll teach you how... I will...
hello darling...
I'm leaving Sam... and for the
record that was the best ever...
Oh thanks...
- I'll call you...
- Yeah... call me... call me...
Bye, sweetheart.
Amazing isn't it, when a call girl
calls you... call girl... calls you...
Dad! I'm getting
married today and you...
What do I do, my son?
Before dying your Mom made me
promise that after she goes..
I should do all that I
never did while she was alive...
I'm just fulfilling my promise...
And what about the promise I
made to Maya? Can I fulfill that?
- Of course... Why not?
- Can we go?
Just a minute... just a minute...
This is from me...
And this from your Mom...
God bless you...
- Hello...
- Dev... I got the job...
- What?
- I got the job!!
Wow... That's amazing...
You got the job...
Guys... Rhea got the job...
What is this noise? I
can't hear a thing...
Nothing... Nothing at all...
Just a small match that we won...
Oh yeah! The match... of course...
I'm so sorry... I forgot completely...
Rhea I'm your husband...
just don't forget that...
Shut up Dev... And congratulations
baby... Tell me how was it?
Fantastic... My last goal...
All that tension... excitement...
God... Rhea... Rhea, you
should have been here...
Yeah... I know...
But I had an interview...
I know sweetheart... I know...
You know what...
We'll fix up the next match after
checking with your busy schedule...
Dev...
And if you have the
time just have a look...
at my five
million dollar contract...
Five million dollars?
Why? Jealous? That now
I earn more than you?
Not jealous baby... Happy... Happy
that your dream has come true...
Our dream, Rhea...
Yeah I know... By the way I'm
going to fetch Arjun from school...
Will you please fetch
Mom from the wedding?
God... I completely forgot that...
What's the matter Rhea? You seem
to be forgetting a lot these days...
Yeah! That's true... And by
the way Happy Anniversary!
Shit... Happy Anniversary!
Hey guys...
My son's getting married...
My son's getting married...
Today I'm going to
part with my daughter...
and get a daughter-in-law home...
Hey Maya... We are coming...
I'm the happiest guy in the...
Hey what's with you?
- Dude... I'm nervous...
- Why?
It's taken her three
years to say 'yes'...
She won't run away at
the last minute, will she?
No... No... She can't
run away anywhere...
Yeah... After all where will she
find a husband like me, right?
No... Our security is very tight...
Move it... Move it...
We are already running late...
Oh my God! Chris... Why
are you sewing this now?
This is not a dip... It's dessert...
It's called suji ka halwa...
- Who Suzie?
- Not Suzie... Give it to me... Come on... Go...
Go into the kitchen...
They'll drive me mad... All
the idiots from New York...
Sorry.
- God... That scared me...
- Didn't mean to...
- Hello...
- Hello...
I'm Sam... And this is my house...
I'm Kamal and this is my food...
Really... may I?
Thank you.
Wow... Definitely a sardarni...
How did you know that?
Because I have been fed
and slapped by them...
I know... I have
heard a lot about you...
Don't go by what others say...
But all that's said is
always by others, Mr. Talwar...
Whose word does one go by then?
Mine... My word... You
are from Chandigarh...
And how did you figure that out?
Definitely Chandigarh...
Mom... What are you doing?
Just... Nothing...
Ready to go?
No... I don't know what's
taking the bride so long...
You carry on...
I'll come on my own...
- Are you sure?
- Yeah... You go...
Okay.
Excuse me... excuse me...
Please don't mess the garden...
I have just cleaned it up...
- Are you the gardener?
- What do you think?
I think you have stolen the bride's
clothes... Should I inform inside?
- Could you please leave me alone?
- Of course... not...
It's your wedding and you are
sitting outside here... Why?
Do you have a problem?
Not directly... But indirectly I
do... My mother has a problem...
The faster you go inside, the faster
my mother can leave from here...
You are a strange man...
You sat down?
Should I lie down and chat?
- One to one discussions always happen sitting down...
- Discussion?
Yes... I know you have a problem...
Come on... Talk to me...
Tell me your problem...
Why should I discuss
my problem with you?
So you admit you have a problem...
By the way I don't
take advice from anyone...
but I'm always ready
to give advice to others...
You should always
listen to strangers...
Sometimes they know
better than our own...
Are you married?
Einstein... It's five years today...
What did you think before marrying?
Who thinks before marrying?
Just kidding...
Rhea and me are
friends from college...
So we thought we'd give our
friendship a new meaning...
besides what can be
better than spending...
your entire life
with your friend?
At times friendship replaces love...
and then there's no
space left for love...
Yeah... yeah...
By the way the guy
waiting for you inside...
is he your friend or your love?
You can't take that long...
I have known Rishi since childhood...
After my parents died Rishi and
his father have been my family...
Oh... What a sweet family...
But that's not the answer to
my question... Do you love him?
I do... But not the
way I thought I would...
Like how? Like in good books
and bad films? That kind of love?
No... The way love ought to be...
That kind of love...
That kind of love... But
where does it exist any more?
Listen to this...
'The sagas of everlasting
romances have gone past long ago...
Just learn to make do
with tiny love stories...'
Good.
Does that mean you
don't love your wife?
You can't take that long...
We are happy... We have made
our little world together...
That's not the
answer to my question...
The question here is more
about your life than my answer...
You are at a crossroad in life
where there are two roads...
One that leads to happiness,
which I think you deserve...
and the other that
leads to an endless wait...
Wait for love... Which
you may never find...
What if I find that
love after marriage?
If you don't look for it...
you won't find it...
And you are definitely not
finding it sitting on this bench...
Go inside and get married...
The wedding is waiting for you...
and here you are sitting with
a stranger making small talk...
You should be ashamed...
What will people say?
Shame on you... Go on...
go... go and get married... Go...
It was nice talking to you...
Well... I'd rather
be playing football...
But it was a pleasure
to meet you, Ma'am...
Maya...
Dev... Dev Anand... bad one... Now
go fast, get married and be happy...
Good bye... Sayonara... Goodbye...
Not good bye... Goodbye kills
the hope of meeting again...
And who knows? We may meet again...
T
Just like fragrance
merges into breeze...
And fades away...
Intense moments, with time...
Have a way of seeming like dreams...
Who knows? We may meet again yet...
You should never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
They say time heals all wounds...
But in some relationships,
some wounds only...
get deeper with time...
Do you guys have a
permit for this? Damn...
Ready? Black beast... That's the
new fear that stalks New York...
Known as the black beast this
dangerous criminal has kidnapped...
yet another child
from Central Park...
No one knows if it
is a man or a woman...
He's nicknamed black beast...
because the criminal wears
a trademark long, black coat...
Police has warned to keep
an attentive eye on your kids...
and not to let them
go out of your sight..
Shit...
Don't cry my son... don't cry...
I'm right here...
What the... What are you doing?
Sitting on my leg...
Sorry sir... Please don't mind... My
Tinu here is just a little nervous...
he thinks the black
beast is going to kidnap him...
Please don't mind sir... please...
Why should I mind? My
leg's already broken...
Oh Tinu... my small,
fat little angel...
the black beast
will not kidnap you...
To kidnap you he has
to lift you first...
And have you looked at your weight?
My little fatso...
Your son's not a child...
- he is a pig... pig!
- What?
And with God's blessing
even if he manages to lift him...
he will die of a heart attack...
- Mummy!
- Mummy! You mean she's still alive?
How did she survive the
weight of your father?
- How rude!
- Rude? You football field!
Just pick this football of
yours and leave right now...
Come on... let's go... we
don't want to sit here...
Come on go... You should
have asked before sitting...
And by the way does your
entire family ever fit...
in a single photograph?
Mummy!
Should we go?
You know I'll leave when you
want to... What's the need to ask?
God... Dev... I just
asked a simple question...
God... Rhea... Even I
didn't answer in French...
I'm going home...
Good... very good... Do
you know the way home?
Yes Dev... I know the way... I
just don't know you any more...
It's strange... No one seems to have
a sense of humor this morning...
Come on... let's go... together...
Maya... Maya-H
Maya... MAYA!
- What is it?
- The house will collapse if you clean.
Rishi...
- What?
- Take off your pants...
- Take off what?
- Your pants...
- Here?
- Where then?
- But why?
- Why?
I know why... Oh my god...
Come on Rishi...
Quickly... I don't have time...
I know... I've always wanted
to do this in the kitchen...
- It's been a dream...
- Yeah... Mine too...
- Wow!
- Fast...
Hello...
- Now it's your turn...
- Why?
Why? Then how are we...?
It'll be kind of tough...
Rishi... I don't have
to remove anything...
because my clothes
have no stain...
Stain?
Yes... Stain... A big one... And
you were all set to go out with it...
Maya...
When will you stop being
my mother and be my wife?
When you stop being my
child and become my husband...
If I stop being your child
who will you mother then?
What happened?
Nothing... Since I can't
have children of my own...
I should think of
you as my child, right?
Oh come on, Maya... You know
that's not what I meant...
- I really don't care about that...
- Here... Take this... It's gone...
Thank you...
Listen... Tonight's the
Sanderson Hotel opening...
- What time do you want to go?
- I'm not coming...
Maya... If I go alone everywhere
people will think there's a problem...
- I don't care about people...
- And me?
Look Rishi... This nightlife,
events, parties...
I don't belong to that
part of your life...
Then which part of my
life do you belong to, Maya?
Which part of my life
do you belong to, Rishi?
When was the last time we
did something that I wanted?
You want to clean the house...
And that really isn't my
idea of an ideal weekend babe...
Then babe... What's your idea?
Actually my ideal weekend
would involve a lot of...
OK... Come... let's discuss it...
Whoa... Discussion...
No... No... bye!
- Why?
- No...
This is great! You start something
and then don't want to pursue it...
Rishi I want to discuss...
Rishi... Rishi!
You are such a child!
Maya!
- Congratulations Rhea...
- For what?
The figures just came in...
Diva is America's No.2 fashion
magazine... Thanks to you...
Come on Rhea... let's celebrate...
Hold on guys...
One minute... One minute...
there will be no celebrations...
We will celebrate when DIVA
becomes the No.1 fashion magazine...
So pull up your stockings ladies...
'Cos you have more late nights...
more hard work...
And if your husbands leave you...
Trust me, you are better off...
back to work!
Hey Rhea... Wait up...
I just spoke to the
London head office...
- and we think you should move there...
- Really?
Yeah... So that you can control all
the fashion magazines in the group...
But isn't this all a bit too...
Rhea... Rhea... Rhea... Do you even
understand the meaning of all this?
This will be the biggest
move of your career...
No, Jai... This will be a
big move for your company...
You know what? You
are something else...
You are intelligent,
confident, beautiful...
Just one problem...
You are married...
But anyway married or unmarried...
How does it matter
these days... Right?
It matters to me, Jai...
What is he doing here?
When I have said that we are not
organizing the party why is he here?
But Rishi what can I do?
He refuses to leave... He says
he won't go till we agree...
- What do you mean he won't leave?
- He's even threatening to sue us...
Sue... Who is he to...?
Excuse me... Excuse me...
Yes...
Dude... I have already told you
I'm not organizing this party...
But why? You organize
parties for the whole world...
Why can't you do it for your father?
The whole world hasn't
had two heart attacks...
Give some thought to your age...
What's age? Just look at my heart...
Ask the beauties around...
they think I'm a rock star!
Dad! Before you embarrass
me any further, please go...
Hey... Listen... Why are
you being so difficult?
It's just a simple
party to be organized...
Just give me a sixties setting...
the best wine and a hundred
beautiful girls... That's all...
And what do you plan to
do with hundred girls?
- What?... Yeah!
- Right...
I want to know... Why do you
throw this party every year?
Now look... That is
not your problem...
Just organize this party and
my red Ferrari is yours...
Dude... If you think you can
buy me out by bribing me...
- You are absolutely right... I love that car...
- Yeah!
- What do you want the girls to wear?...Done...
- Nothing!
Good morning... soccer moms
and soccer dads... get ready...
Our first team today are the seven
time winners from Westside High...
The Tigers...
Coached by George Push...
with a lovely tusch...
Playing against
the Tigers are the...
tiny little coochie-coo
oh-they're-so-cute Dolphins...
Coached by Dev Saran...
What's wrong? Your
wife's still paying the bills?
No... Now yours is...
What?
The match is about to begin...
Tigers!
- Where are you going, idiot? Go... Yes..
- No...
I-m Arjun... l-m...
Yes...
Come on! Hit Arjun!
Your ball...
Happy?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Papa... I'm sorry...
I don't want to play football...
I want to play the violin...
What? You want to play the violin?
Wear a dress from tomorrow...
You will look perfect...
Don't do that... Just shut up...
Hi... Hi your highness... Your
son has lost the match again...
Looks like he's taken after
his father... Let's celebrate...
Dev... Please... Stop
taking your anger out on him...
He'd probably have won
if you coached him well...
We'd probably have won if you
were here to boost our morale...
Can I speak to him please?
Yeah of course... It's
the queen mother for you...
Come on... come on...
Mama... You have to be there for
the next match... You never come...
Yes sweetheart... Next
time I'll be there for sure...
Guess what? Mama's got
you a new playstation...
Play station?
Wow... I love you Mom...
Wow mom... I love you...
Playstation?
If they are selling some time at
the toy shop please buy that...
Arjun needs that a little more...
Dev... You... What's your problem?
Tansen... I'm going
to buy the tickets...
If you move from
here I will slap you...
Let's go home and I'll
make you wear a dress...
OK Tanya... Now listen to me...
Stay close to me all the time...
I read about the black
beast this morning...
We never know where he might
be lurking in his black coat...
- Now hold my hand... is it clean?
- Yes.
Good girl... Should we go here?
Or there? Who should I ask?
- Move it... Come on, guys!
- Excuse me!
I am sorry.
I saw you my beloved...
And it dawned on me
how crazy love can be...
- Me?
- I saw you my beloved...
Here I come Simran... Here I come...
Mummy is here.
Thank you Maya... I
really owe you one...
Not at all... She's
a real sweetheart...
She's been very nice.
She's very fast.
Black beast...
When will they nab him?
Got you... I told you
not to move from there...
Then why did you move?
You kids have really troubled
me today... Specially you...
You know what I am going
to do to you?
I'm going to cut you
into tiny pieces...
and put them in a
mixer to make Jamba juice...
I like children's Jamba juice...
Shut up... idiot...
- Black beast!
- Are we going to stand here all day?
Come with me now... and don't
you dare get lost again... Come...
Come. Idiot.
I don't know why
children are born at all...
Why can't humans be born full grown?
Idiot children! Don't
know how to play football.
- Don't worry, kid.
- Papa.
I'm taking you to your Papa... I
won't let anything happen to you...
I'll save you, son.
The next time you
lose I'm going to...
Arjun...
Arjun.
Black Beast!
Give me a minute here...
Come now... Run!
- My ball... You shut up!
- Shut up!
Black beast!
Yes!
- Oh God!
- Move it. Move it please.
Excuse me! Move it. Move it.
Is she the black beast?
Maya!
She's become the Black Beast?
But why are you crying?
I thought I was being kidnapped...
I don't have such good fortune
that someone will kidnap you...
- Should I kill you?...Quiet then...
- No...
- Sir... You will have to come with us...
- I will officer...
I hate you Black Beast!
E.R.! Patient with a leg injury...
Patient in trauma... be prepared...
Be prepared... patient with
leg injury... On the way...
Make way... make way...
Patient with leg injury here...

Excuse me... I have a leg injury...
Oh my God... get him...
Sir! Sir!
- Take the child...
- Take him and keep him...
Sir, do you have a leg injury?
Yes... No...
I used to have a leg injury...
You're in trauma...

I am not the..
Calm down... calm down

Arjun... tell the fatso...
Calm down!
Don't touch my ass!
I am going to kill you...
I am going to save you...
God bless you...
Don't touch my... Mummy!
Arjun... papa loves you...
Fat woman!
- Hi!
- Can I help you?
I'm here to see the
Black Beast... My wife...
Hi... Excuse me... I'm so sorry...
All this is my husband's fault...
Your husband is the Black Beast?
No... he's just a beast...
Okay.
Look, it's been a
big misunderstanding.
But all is well now... Your wife is
fine now... Just a minor sprain...
Thank God... Rishi Talwar...
Rhea Saran...
Rhea Saran? The Diva from DIVA...
Guilty as charged...
- Wow... Small world... I run a small PR firm.
- Kamikaze...
I've been trying to
meet you for a while...
It's not easy meeting me...
Trust me it's even more
difficult to avoid me...
So sorry to disrupt your
wonderful conversation...
But if you'd like to see
your husband and your wife...
they're in room 502...
We tranquilized you by mistake...
We're so sorry for the confusion...
Are you OK?
- Does your mother love you?
- Yes...
Cause she's really gonna miss you...
I'm going to kill you...
My lawyer will call you...
My lawyer will speak with you...
And my lawyer will speak to you...
You... I know you...
Even I remember...
We've met before...
Now I can't walk for a
week because of you...
I can't walk for
life because of you...
What?
If I hadn't met you my life
would have been different...
My pain would have been different...
And if I hadn't met you I
wouldn't have married...
Wouldn't have married?
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
- Good... Bad...
- Good?...Bad?
I mean... I don't know...
I don't know?
Are you happy?
- You can't take that long...
- Who are you to ask me all this?
You can't answer a
question with a question...
Why should I bother
about your questions?
Why should I answer you?
Who are you?
Who am I?
I'm the father of the child
you were running away with...
Don't you have your own children?
Oh...
you don't...
Yes... I don't have any...
I can't have them...
I teach children... I'm a
mother to all of them...
Mother India...
Teaching children...
Running away with them...
are you able to fill
your emptiness with all this?
Because your life is empty...
incomplete...
It shows in your eyes...
Just like in mine...
Dev...
- Mama...
- Oh Rhea... Why did you take the trouble?
You are so considerate...
I'm beginning to feel
pressurized by your niceness...
Dev please... it's
been a really long day...
I apologise on his behalf...
I'm so so sorry... Once again...
Rhea look... It's cool...
It's cool...
It's cool... Rhea,
it's totally cool.
Really, it's cool.
We haven't met... Rishi...
Rishi Kapoor?
No... Husband...
Nobody's perfect... My
head is spinning... Bye bye...
Sayonara... Goodbye...
No good bye...
Goodbye kills all
hope of meeting again...
And who knows?
We might meet again...
Dev... No one ever
wants to meet you again...
OK... Bye...
OK... Nice meeting you... Bye...
Is he on drugs?
There you go... Not to worry Maya...
the doctor has said you'll
be fine in two to three days...
After that it's back to
your normal exercise...
- Dusting, cleaning, vacuuming, brushing...
- Shut up!
Sorry...
God... Not you... It's that...
What was his name?
Dev... he was talking nonsense...
and did you see how he
was talking to his wife?
He's so rude...
Maya... Not all husbands
can be as good as me...
To keep my heart at your feet...
Love you all day long...
God Maya...
You are so sexy...
Tonight I'm going to...
Tonight I'm going to...
Maya...
Maya!
Hi...
You?
Of course not... It's someone else...
What a strange question!
You? Who else will I be?
- Whatever... I'm glad you are here...
- Were you thinking of me?
Yes... I've been
thinking of you for a week...
Listen all that I said that day
was because of the injection...
I'm married... And to think of a
married man in that way is a sin...
- You talk rubbish...
- Yeah!
I wanted to meet you to say that
the things you said to me that day...
are true... And the
truth is always bitter...
You are bitter! Not the truth...
And who are you?
The Supreme Court? To pass
judgments on others' lives?
- I'm not listening to this...
- Just listen to me...
- I'm not... OK...
- Just listen...
Listen... I'm very happy...
Thank you...
You should think
about your own life...
I'm sure your life is empty...
and your dreams, unfulfilled...
That's why you keep searching
for the same in others' lives...
You are an unhappy man
and will always be...
You are a beautiful
woman and will always be...
Maya... Maya... Just listen...
We are both alike...
very alike... I'm sorry...
We travel from the same station...
Both teach children...
Both of us are wounded...
It's just that my wounds show...
yours don't...
And we can discuss our
sad lives over coffee...
No Thank you... My
husband's waiting for me at home...
Well... Even Rhea
must be home by now...
Hey!
Dude! What's going on here?
What went on is over now...
Come on Dad... This is my house...
Just chill... Chill... Chill son...
We were just passing by and
so we thought we'd just...
you know... rock n roll...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
If Maya arrives now
she will kill me...
Papa is going to kill me...
Today was the music
class so I bunked football...
No my child... Nothing will happen...
I'll take care of it...
No grandma...
he's going to kill me...
Why will he kill you?
You are learning the guitar
and that's a good thing...
Not guitar Mom... violin...
Oh... violin... I don't understand
why he is so scared of Dev...
- But Mom you don't understand...
- No darling you relax...
But Mom...
Shut up! Nothing is
going to happen...
I'll tell Dev that
you are not well... OK?
- OK...
- Why should we lie?
We'll just get back
to you darling...
Now come on go upstairs
and grandma...
will give you a nice
hot water bath later...
Good boy...
Shit... Maya has come...
Please hide this one somewhere?
In my arms?
Dad... Just put some clothes on...
OK... OK...
Mom... he's come...
Hi!
How was your day? Do you know...
I know... I know everything...
Everything? No... I think you...
Please... watch it...
Don't try to hide from
me I know everything...
Yes... I know... I
saw it with my eyes...
Did you hear that?
She knows everything...
Look at this... And we were
trying to hide from her...
Dad! Even you know?
What do you mean when did I know?
It was my idea to make an excuse...
Now the poor fellow is
hiding in the bathroom...
What? He's in my bathroom?
She is in my bedroom?
Don't go in... Poor thing...
She's not wearing any.
What is she doing without clothes?
What do you do without clothes?
I will not let him live... I'm
going to... What are you doing?
- Dev... listen... please... Stop it, Dev!
- Mummy.
I pray to you... he's already
too scared I'm going to him now...
- Why?
- To give him a bath...
So now you will bathe him?
That too in my bathroom...
The bathroom doesn't
belong to just you...
It's mine too... he will use it...
Both of us will bathe him...
- Oh yeah... Sure!
- Shut up!
How could you do this?
Aren't you ashamed?
But what have I done?
Please... Please...
You two stop fighting...
I'm taking her to my house...
Why would you take her
to your house?
- Because I paid her...
- She takes money?
Yeah... Nothing comes
for free these days...
By the way what's
the rate these days?
- Per day or weekends?
- Weekends...
- Let's see now... the last time...
- Stop!
Both of you have gone crazy!
No Dev... You are crazy...
Look at what you are doing...
I can't take this any more...
I'm sleeping with him tonight...
- Me too...
- You too?
Have some shame... Look
at his age and yours...
You look at your age...
Don't cross your limits...
Mommy! What about your limits?
The two of you... both...
- Yes?
- Disgusting...
And she... I will not
spare her... Rhea...!
Rhea?
- Rishi...
- Rishi?
I'm so hot, I am so hot,
hot, hot, hot...
Rhea... Rhea...
Rhea!
Oh God! Rishi?
He was just inviting
me for his Dad's party..
So that I can see his work...
- It's just a PR exercise Dev...
- What about the flowers?
Rhea sent them for you...
- Oh God... This confusion...
- Stop it, Sam!
Where are you going baby?
And who is this?
This? This is your mother to be...
I don't believe this...
You thought I was
having an affair with Rishi?
What's with you, Dev?
You are crazy...
I'm crazy?
I thought you were crazy...
I mean what's happened
to your taste?
The next time you want to
have an affair let me know...
I will look for the right guy...
After all you have to maintain a
standard, the great Rhea Saran...
Dev... Don't try to hide
your feelings with...
your stupid sense of humor...
You were jealous and I love it...
Yeah right!
This just means that somewhere
there is a little love left... Right?
Yes... very deep inside...
Come on get ready...
I'm ready to go...
You are coming wearing this?
No... I'm taking this
off and coming nude...
No Dev... Why don't you wear the
suit that I bought last week...
Why sweetheart? Embarrassed?
Embarrassed that I'm wearing this?
Embarrassed that in these clothes..
I won't look like the rich
and famous Rhea Saran's husband?
I'm sorry to disappoint you Rhea..
But even new clothes are
not going to make me new...
Even I love the old Dev...
but he is lost somewhere...
You are the one who lost him...
Rishi, we are getting late.
What are you doing?
- Maya!
- What are you doing Rishi?
Maya, I am doing the dance, making
love and then getting out tonight.
- I'm celebrating!
- Celebrating what?
- My wife's jealous...
- I got some reaction at last...
God Rishi... Stop
behaving like a child...
- We are getting late... Come on...
- Maya...
Rishi... We are getting late...
Please go and change your clothes...
Tell me something... What if I
was really having an affair?
- What would you do?
- Rishi..
- Come on... Humor me...
- Rishi...
Please...
OK... If you were truly having an
affair I would think... analyze...
try to find out
why it happened...
And then I would
discuss it with you...
Discuss with me?
Come on woman, show some passion...
Say that you would scream... shout...
weep hysterically... Some drama...
Drama? If you wanted drama you
should have married an actress...
But you settled for a
boring teacher... So sorry...
Oh God Maya... you are so touchy...
- Then why do you say such things?
- I was just kidding...
What if I was having an affair?
What would you do?
Your affair?
Fantastic... very good!
What was so funny?
What do you mean what's funny?
You can't handle one relationship...
How will you manage two? But anyway
I like the attitude... keep at it...
I'm going to get ready... See ya...
What's the matter Rishi? I
can't handle a relationship...
No passion... No drama...
I'm not a good wife...
can't be a mother...
Since I have so many
flaws why don't you leave me?
Both of us have flaws, Maya...
But the difference is that..
You always talk about
breaking the relationship..
And I talk about making it work...
Please make sure there's
service everywhere... OK?
And why is nobody
sewing in that corner?
Come on come on please
move it... Oh hello...
Hello there... Long time no see...
Just as well...
Incidentally hasn't the
size of Chandigarh increased..
Since the last time we met...
It's the number in your eye
that has increased, Mr. Talwar...
Hello... Aren't you going to
introduce me to your daughter?
Daughter? Maybe yours...
Meet Saturday...
Saturday?
Yeah... I can't
remember all their names..
So I call them by the
day I meet them... yeah baby?
- Yeah!
- Yeah right... See you later gorgeous...
- Who's that?
- My mother...
Ah Rhea... thanks for coming...
Of course we had to come...
By the way the sixties
theme is a great idea...
It's all so beautiful...
No... No... You are
beautiful darling... hello...
I'm Rishi's father...
in every way...
And I'm Rhea's husband...
in almost every way...
Do you like my suit? Do you like it?
Rhea... You look gorgeous...
- Thank you...
- I really think we should have that affair...
Sure... I know for a fact that
my husband will not object...
Neither will my wife... as long
as we sit and discuss it later...
- Right darling?
- Oh wow... You guys have discussions at home?
In our case we have to
meet by appointment...
I think I need a drink...
Ah super... Let's all get drunk...
Rhea?
Super..
Do you know a good divorce lawyer?
I hate these parties...
I think these parties are organized
to touch other people's wives...
Don't even think about that...
Don't worry... I haven't
reached such desperate days...
Look at them... Just look
at them... Oh my darling...
Mwaah... Mwaah...
Mwaah... Disgusting..
You know... I have just realized
that not only do I hate parties...
I hate people...
As far as I know even
people aren't crazy about you...
Not that they are
crowding around you either...
It doesn't make a difference to me...
They are all strangers...
Even your husband?
Rishi...
Fair skinned faces...
Moon lit faces...
Dark long tresses...
Sky blue eyes...
Fair skinned faces...
Moon lit faces...
Dark long tresses...
Sky blue eyes...
They weave dreams...
They lead you astray...
Take away your sanity...
They drive you crazy...
They ignite a fire...
intoxicate your being...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love...
Come sway with me...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love.
Come sway with me...
These lithe bodies...
These swaying hips...
First they attack the heart...
Then go for your life...
These flashes of lightning...
These sorceresses of love...
I have seen many
and yet fall prey...
They come... and they go...
At their whim and fancy...
These angels... these fairies...
At a mere glance from them...
The world can go crazy...
And be at their feet...
And yet these beauties...
Don't know what love is...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll...
Come sway with me...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love.
Come sway with me...
Head in a cap and a
red scarf waving...
Oh... What do I say?
Fair skinned maiden with a
black strand on the face...
Oh... What do I say?
These pretty faces...
These beautiful women...
They don't know what love is...
Or what it is to be loyal...
These stone hearted lovers...
What do they care?
What we go through,
coping with them?
They are ignorant...
like strangers...
What do they know about feelings?
They don't know...
they don't care...
That hearts can break
with words they say...
Like asking for comfort from fire...
Or fire from ice..
We have spent out entire lives...
Now we know what we lost...
Wasting our time
that was precious...
Rock and roll...
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love.
Come sway with me...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love.
Come sway with me...
Rock and roll.
Fair skinned faces...
Moon lit faces...
Dark long tresses...
Sky blue eyes...
They weave dreams...
They lead you astray...
Take away your sanity...
They drive you crazy...
They ignite a fire...
intoxicate your being...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love...
Come sway with me...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love...
Come sway with me...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love...
Come sway with me...
Rock and roll, my love.
My heart sings for you...
Rock and roll, my love...
- Come sway with me...
- Maya...
Rishi... And all you
wonderful people...
Thank you for being
here with me tonight...
And I hope that all of you are
having a great time... yeah!
Yeah!
You know people always ask me why
I throw this party every year...
What's so special about this day?
The day is special...
It's on this day that I met
my wife for the first time...
That's why every year
I celebrate this day...
and also seek her forgiveness...
Forgiveness for each day...
when I chose my dreams
over my relationships...
Forgiveness for each minute...
when I hurt her and
didn't even bother to make up...
But most of all...
forgiveness for all
those innumerable moments...
when I forgot to tell
her how much I loved her...
assuming that I will
have a lot of time to say so...
But I was wrong...
With her death I lost that time...
That's why...
I always say
that time means 'now'
If you have to love, love 'now'...
If you have to ask for forgiveness,
ask 'now'...
If you want to hold hands,
hold it 'now'...
Or else years later you will
find yourself at a party like me...
asking for
forgiveness from your beloved...
So...
All you wonderful
married couples out there...
Look to your partner and
tell them 'I love you'...
And all of you that are single...
Turn this way... Girls only...
And tell me that... Alright... O...
This speech is
getting really boring...
Let's party... Come on guys...
Hit it... Eh Chandigarh...
Last night I encountered
the real Samarjit hidden...
behind 'Sexy Sam'...
I liked him...
Really? And what was the
difference between Sam and Samarjit?
Sam runs after girls and Samarjit,
after memories...
You really miss your
wife very much... Don't you?
I can understand...
Tell me... How do you
cope with your loneliness?
I spend time with friends...
I have very few friends...
Not from today...
Oh... so you will be my friend?
Absolutely...
So... friendship means no touching?
All you are going to get is this...
Thank you...
It's good for a start...
Mummy!
What... What are your intentions?
The intentions are
very noble my son...
Just that I won't take dowry...
I'm anti dowry...
Mom... What is he saying?
- Sam... What are you saying?
- Kamal... What is he saying?
What are all of you saying?
I'm scared to come
out of the station...
You never know what
you'll get to see...
Not only the station... you should
not get out of the house at all...
The world is evil...
Sam... Just a minute...
Both of us...
Wow! So now it's 'us' huh?
Samarjit and I are both alone...
We lost our love years ago...
And when two people are
going through the same phase..
They understand each other
better... They become close...
What they can't say to others...
they can say to each other...
Precisely... Two strangers...
Same situation...
Then friendship... and
the problem is solved...
That's it...
Simple... right Maya? Cheers!
My marriage is failing Dev...
And from what I can see,
so is yours...
I can't save my marriage
on my own...
I need a friend...
A friend who will understand me...
who will make me understand...
Who is familiar with
my circumstance...
And who can do this better than you?
That's why I'm here to
extend a hand in friendship...
Will you accept it?
I'm hurting Maya...
I want to sit down...
And that's how two
strangers came together...
to save their relationships
and gave birth to a new one...
On that rainy day neither of us
saw the storm that awaited us...
After that we met everyday...
I don't know why but when I
was with Maya I was different...
I had found my lost smile...
We had considerably
increased the business...
of the New York
cafes quite a lot...
We spoke a lot about Rhea
and Rishi...
How wrong they were...
How right we were...
then how right they
were and how wrong we were...
But in relationships no matter
who's right and who's wrong...
someone has to
make the first move...
And we decided it should be ours...
This is a very interesting book...
It says don't look for your
spouse's faults in your marriage...
Improve your own flaws...
And what if someone's perfect?
Ya... Right... Anyway
let's start with me...
tell me all the things
that are wrong with me...
And listen tell me the truth...
be frank...
be honest... or there's no point...
Alright... here goes...
You are that teacher type...
Boring... with no personality...
You are a compulsive cleaner
to the point of illness...
basically you are a
loyal maidservant...
- What?
- You don't have anything womanly in you...
You are not sexy...
Not from any angle...
Maybe from behind...
But no man will get
excited looking at you...
I know your husband gets excited...
but that's probably
because he is visually impaired
- because you don't have...
- Dev... You are so rude... So mean...
What mean? Rude? Didn't you
just ask me to speak the truth?
But you could have
said something nice...
But did you ask me
to say something nice?
And what would you say if I had?
That your eyes are the most
beautiful eyes in the world...
But you didn't ask so
I didn't say...
You know what your problem is? You
don't know how to speak to a lady...
- And you know how?
- Yes... I know what to say to a woman and how...
Oh... So you are a lesbian?
Shut up... I know
because my husband says...
the most romantic
things to me everyday...
Any woman would go
crazy listening to them...
Right... Except you of course...
Listen...
Do you want to learn or no?
Yeah, baby! Very much!
Wow... This place has
so many beds...
Maya, if you were so desperate we
could have booked a hotel room...
Why have we come here?
Listen Dev... I have no time
for your sense of humor...
You have to learn
a lot on this bed...
On this bed? What are the new things
you are going to teach me here?
Just so you know
only my leg is broken...
All the other parts
are absolutely perfect...
OK... This is not going to work...
No... Dev serious... Serious...
- Serous?
- Yeah... serious...
OK... the situation is that Rhea
has come back tired from work...
Now I will tell you
what you need to do...
I'm Dev and you are Rhea...
understand?
No... I don't but whatever...
- Let's start...
- Let's start...
OK... Bouncy bouncy bed...
- Start... Rhea...
- What?
Oh yeah... I'm Rhea...
Rhea would say... As
soon as she came home...
It's been a long tiring day!
- I think you need a massage...
- I do?
I understand. OK, I know this.
Here?
It feels good huh?
Actually it does... really...
You can't do this... No, no,
no. Don't do this.
Oh Rhea...
Rhea?
- You are so beautiful!
- I am Rhea, ya.
Rhea... Your eyes... Your lips...
Your everything...
Oh! Your arms... I
want to die in them...
Don't stop! No... no...
Go... Come here... come here...
I'm taking this bed...
Please do...
Maya...
Rishi... says and does
all these things to you...
And yet you don't... you... don't...
You..
Actually you are
quite sexy... really...
You just need to show it
to Rishi... That's all...
- What's this?... What?
- This is my sister...
We were separated as children...
Maya...
You need to wear clothes
like these for your husband...
No... Dev... If I wear
clothes like these...
I will look like
'that' type of a woman...
Yeah... That's the
type that men like...
Dev... But that looks cheap...
Yeah... Cheap... Cheap is nice...
- I like cheap!...Maya...
- Dev!
You taught me how
to talk to women...
how to massage them...
how to romance them...
If you want to learn how to be
sexy... then ask me... I'm the man...
Dev...
Don't worry... This
will protect you...
- But this...
- But not that...
'Butt' this! That's the whip...
Hit me baby... hit me...
So dude... tell me...
Did you tell Maya about this
last minute football party?
You think she'd allow if I told her?
You are so dead, man!
Hello!
Hey Rhea... The head office is
still waiting for your answer...
What have you decided?
I know Jai but please understand...
I know it will be the
biggest move for my career...
But to shift to London
is not easy for me...
I have to think of
too many things...
Anyway can we talk
about this tomorrow?
OK... I'll call you... Thanks...
Hi...
Hello!
How was your day?
Nice...
God... I had a long tiring day...
Good... I mean...
I think you need a massage... baby...
Massage?
I'm going to be
your masseur, Baby...
You like that? You like that?
Don't say 'ha', say 'ooh'.
- Ooh!
- No, no.. Oooh!
I want to massage your arms.
I want to die in your arms...
Your ears... Your forehead...
Your nose... your cheeks...
Your lips...
All of it is... blue...
Oh God!
Dev... If this was a joke
then it really wasn't funny!
No, no, no. Hey,
listen! Blue baby.. baby..
Maya!
Maya! Here I come! Best of luck...
Where are you? Where
are you? Where are you?
You've been a bad, bad, bad boy...
I'm going to hit you on your...
You're gonna like that... Won't you?
Come to me you naughty... naughty...
naughty... boy!
Where are you? Where
are you? Where are you?
We are all here!
Hello!
So what if we failed the
first time? We'll try again...
Try what? Marriage?
Not marriage... We'll try again...
you know this book says...
What are these books
that you keep reading?
'Fighting for your marriage'
bestseller by Anna Marie Lou...
She knows a lot about marriages...
Of course she would...
She's married four times...
Anna Marie Lou is out
to cheat you...
Watch it... hey... one second... Do
you wanna fight for your marriage?
I'm not married... I'm gay!
Good for you...
You know Dev, I have
one more superb plan...
It'll be far from superb...
It'll be a bullshit plan...
Don't you get tired?
I'm tired... Saving my marriage...
salvaging relationships...
I want a holiday
from all that today...
I want to do something
that I want to do...
There's a big football
match today...
Ohio Extremes vs Chicago Rangers...
I want to see that...
I don't have tickets for the
match and probably won't get them...
yet I want to see it...
Will you come?
It's only football...
Oh my heart, just whisper in my ear.
Which way are you headed?
What is it that you yearn for?
What is it that you seek?
All desires unsaid...
All dreams unfulfilled.
Spell them all out now...
My beloved...
What does your heartbeat sing?
My beloved...
Don't hide from your own dreams...
Oh my heart, just whisper in my ear.
Which way are you headed?
What is it that you yearn for?
What is it that you seek?
All desires
unsaid... All dreams unfulfilled.
Spell them all out now...
My beloved...
What does your heartbeat sing?
My beloved...
Don't hide from your own dreams...
My beloved...
On this path of life...
On this path of love...
On this path of life...
On this path of love...
You have set eyes on
someone special...
You keep questioning...
You keep thinking...
Whether this is the
one you pined for...
Yes, this is the one...
She is the one for you...
You are a thirsty
traveler and she is the river...
Why don't you accept
it and say it to her...
All desires unsaid...
All dreams unfulfilled.
Spell them all out now...
My beloved.
What does your heartbeat sing?
My beloved...
Don't hide from your own dreams...
Dev... Do you know day after is

So I think we should do something
special for Rishi and Rhea...
What do you think?
Maybe we should leave them...
That will be pretty special...
Come on Dev...
Maya... Maya... we will do
whatever you want to do...
Your eyes have found
their destination...
But your feet
hesitate to take the step...
When your heart does
a merry dance...
Why do you shackle your feet?
Dance to the tune
of love you fool...
Let caution fly to the winds...
Why would you want to
deprive your soul...
All desires
unsaid... All dreams unfulfilled.
Spell them all out now...
My beloved...

What is it that you seek?
My beloved...
My beloved...
My beloved...
I'll take it...
Thank you Dev...
Thank you... This was our
best anniversary ever...
Fantastic...
By the way I want to
tell you something...
The head office has
offered me a promotion...
they want me
to shift to London...
It means a better position,
higher salary, big house...
basically the works... And
this morning I decided that...
that you will shift... Wow!
And of course there was
no need to consult me...
After all who am I?
I'm just your husband?
What status do I have?
I'm just here to
applaud for your success...
This one decision of yours
can change all our lives...
But why would you think of that?
Because Rhea Saran only
thinks about herself...
her rocking career, her success,
her happiness... dammit...
It's always about you,
you and you...
No goddamn it... It's about you,
you and only you, Dev...
I was just going to tell you
that I have refused the promotion...
After thinking about you... this
family... But where do you listen?
If you refused the promotion
what was the need to tell me?
Trying to show off your magnanimity?
I wasn't showing off Dev...
I was baring my heart...
Do you have a heart, Rhea?
What heart?
Arjun!
Arjun! Stop that noise...
This is no time to play the violin...
It's time for you to sleep...
You've got school tomorrow...
Go now...
Don't touch the violin...
get out of here...
Arjun! Arjun!
Why are you venting your
anger on him? What has he done?
Don't you dare tell me howl
should behave with Arjun, Rhea...
I know how to handle him...
I have brought him up...
Only I... You had no
time from your work...
Did you ever have
time for him? Did you?
Yes Dev... I didn't have time...
because I work very hard...
No one asks men
when they are busy...
when they have no
time for their children...
Then why are you asking me?
Tell me Dev how can you ask me?
Because the truth is that
I'm the man in this house...
I couldn't be Arjun's mother
because I had to be his father...
So that he could
have all the happiness..
That a football coach
cannot afford to give him...
How did that sound,
Dev? It hurts, doesn't it?
Now you know how it feels?
You have only hurt me Dev...
I always thought you hurt
those you love the most...
But that's not true...
You don't love me at all...
You don't love anyone...
You only hate...
You hate yourself...
your life... your failure...
And I haven't been able to
figure out what angers you more..
Your failure or my success!
Yes Rhea... I'm a failure...
That's true...
But do you know there's a greater
failure than me in this house?
And that's our relationship...
Our marriage...
Our marriage...
Thank you Rhea... Thank you for
letting me stay in your house Rhea...
Why are you so angry Rishi?
What's the big deal if I
didn't feel like it one night?
Come on...
Don't behave like a child!
Shut up! Just shut up!
I have heard enough!
What's the problem Rishi?
Maya... Do you remember the last time
we were intimate with each other?
When Maya? When did
we touch each other?
Held hands or embraced?
Anything? Do you remember?
When did we not turn our backs to
each other in bed? Do you remember?
I don't remember...
You don't remember or
don't want to remember?
I don't want to discuss this...
Why? I thought you
like discussions...
Come on... let's discuss...
let's discuss why...
Why my wife doesn't want
to sleep with me? Come on...
Our relationship cannot grow just
by sleeping with each other Rishi...
It can only grow when we embrace
each other's sorrow and happiness...
And when was the last time
we did that? When Rishi?
A husband and wife don't just share
a bed they share their lives...
What? How dare you?
Do you think I'm the kind of man...
who only feels the
need for his wife in bed?
How dare you, Maya?
To embrace each
other's happiness and pain...
one has to embrace each other...
And you have never
felt that way about me...
'You are a child, you are a child,
you are a child...'
I'm fed up of hearing that...
If I was truly a child I'd
have broken down long ago...
I tolerate you because I'm a man!
- I have heard enough...
- No.
Today you cannot leave like this...
You will have to tell me today...
The truth... tell me...
Why did you marry me?
Why? I married you
because I love you...
I love you a lot.
But why did you marry me, Maya?
Tell me... Why did you marry me?
Rishi leave me please... Rishi
please... You are hurting me...
Rishi... Rishi..,
The truth Maya is that
you never married me...
You compromised...
I'm your life's
biggest compromise...
A compromise that you
regret every day of your life...
rig ht?
Tell me.
Give me an answer...
What answer?
You have nothing to give.
Not love... Not happiness...
Not affection...
You haven't even been
able to give me a child!
And Maya I have never made you feel
inadequate about that... never...
You just did... Just did... Rishi...
Four years ago you said that...
everlasting romances
don't exist any more...
Remember Dev?
Will you say the same even now?
Four years ago you said that...
if I don't look for love
after marriage I won't find it...
What will you say now, Dev?
What will you say?
Answer me...
What are you and me doing at the
station in the middle of the night?
What are we doing, Dev?
Answer... I need answers
to all these questions...
- I don't know...
- Tell me... Where are you going, Dev?
I want the answers...
tell me Dev... tell me...
Answer... I want to know...
tell me...
18th March 2002... You met
me for the first time, Maya...
I remember the exact time, Maya...
Since that day I have felt
like I have known you forever...
Is this the answer to your question?
Maybe not... Maybe this...
Everyday your train
leaves the station at 4.32...
and mine at 4.21... and
everyday I miss my train so...
that I can spend some
more moments with you...
- Is this the answer to your question?
- Dev...
Everyday I leave you at the station
but your thoughts don't leave me...
Is this the answer to your question?
Then try this... I'm a married
man Maya and I think you forget..
That you are too...
Since both of us are married..
What are we doing at the
station in the middle of the night?
Bingo... Bingo... I
think I have the answer...
That's the answer to your question,
right? Listen to the answer...
I love you Maya...
I love you, Maya..
And you love me too!
Mom, why are we discussing this?
You are Dev's mother...
you will take up for him...
I'm a woman before
I'm a mother, Rhea...
And I know you are right... But what
happens just because I think so...
the situation is
not going to change...
Things will only
change when Dev changes...
And that's not going to happen...
Rhea... Rhea...
Mom... please... I'm tired...
I've tried enough to understand
him... to get closer to him...
One fine day he just decided to
step back from the relationship...
He did not step back Rhea...
You raced ahead...
You have to wait for him...
Why? Why is a woman
always expected to wait?
Because they are stronger...
And have you thought about Arjun?
I'm not the kind of woman...
who will use her child
as an excuse to back down...
I'm not that weak...
You are not weak...
Your relationship is...
You have to give it strength...
You have to give it time...
I will give this relationship
nothing till Dev gives it love...
You are going somewhere?
Paris... For ten days...
To organize a few events...
Last night the
things you said to her...
Last night I said a lot of
things I shouldn't have...
and a few that were
very important to say...
Try to understand her Rishi...
How do I understand a
heart that has no place for me?
That's not true,
Rishi... She loves you a lot...
Look into her eyes... Who
else can all that love be for?
I wish the love in her eyes
reached her lips once in a while...
Dad, everyday I tell her how much
I love her... has she ever said it?
Sorry dad... I can't take it...
Not any more...
Now?
Now what, Dev?
It was important to say that we love
each other... So we've said it...
And what did we gain by saying it?
I don't know...
but if we hadn't, we
would have lost something...
You know Dev that this
relationship has no future...
Yes... I know...
That's why it needs to be
abandoned on this beautiful note...
One last cup of coffee?
No...
Your train...
Not my train any more...
I'm planning to stop
traveling by train...
Buy myself a new car...
A nice new blue car...
You like blue?
I like blue...
Time to go.
Your life is empty... I
can see it in your eyes...
Do you remember when
we touched each other?
Held hands? Anything?
Do you remember?
I leave you at the station everyday
but your thoughts never leave me...
To embrace each other's
happiness and pain...
one has to embrace each other...
And you have never
felt that way about me...
Since both of us are married...
what are we doing at the
station in the middle of the night?
You have to tell me today Maya...
tell me the truth...
Why did you marry me?
Sometimes friendship
takes the place of love...
and then there's no
place left for love...
The truth is that you
never married me, Maya...
You compromised...
Listen to the answer,
Maya... I love you Maya...
And you love me too...
And what if I find my
soul mate after marriage?
Dev...
I like blue...
Do you know when we reached here...?
I am yours and you, mine...
I'm wonder struck at this moment...
When moonlight has emerged
in the middle of the day...
It seems awake yet it's dreaming...
My lovelorn heart...
Do you know when we reached here...?
I am yours and you, mine...
Intoxicated souls... Musky bodies...
There's a pureness in the air...
In this moment that we are in...
there's so much color...
Spilling out of our eyes...
The blue sky showers on us...
Soft, silky rays of light...
Do you know when we reached here...?
I am yours and you, mine...
I'm wonder struck at this moment...
When moonlight has emerged
in the middle of the day...
I was blissfully ignorant...
Of this love that
flows forth unbridled...
True is this feeling...
true is this love...
All else is just an illusion...
My heart slowly hums the
melodious notes of love...
Do you know when we reached here...?
I am yours and you, mine...
I'm wonder struck at this moment...
When moonlight has emerged
in the middle of the day...
It seems awake yet it's dreaming...
My lovelorn heart...
We were crazy... We were strange...
We were different...
Very different... Incomplete on
our own but so complete together...
We were not walking on the ground...
There, we had slipped long ago...
We were flying in the sky...
Talking to the clouds...
We didn't have a care in the world...
We had made our own world...
Our world... Maya and Dev's world...
The world of our dreams...
But then dreams always leave
when you wake up to reality...
Come on drink your milk fast...
- I don't want to drink it...
- Drink it!
- Here...
- It's OK...
It's OK Dev... Thank you...
I don't know what to do Sam...
I was going to ask you for
advice and I come to know...
that it's the same
situation in your house too... God!
Every house seems to
have the same story...
Will you stop this
TV soap commentary?
Sam... be serious for once...
What's the point of
being serious... Look...
Your son is mule headed...
He is not going to do anything...
Maya isn't at fault so she
isn't going to do anything...
So what do we do, Kamlu?
I know... You do have a point...
Whatever needs to be done has
to be done by Rhea and Rishi...
But they are both being so
stubborn... Who will convince them?
What if they convince each other?
And why will they do that?
They hardly know each other...
Precisely... two strangers...
same situation...
Then friendship and
problem solved... remember?
But how will they meet each other?
Dad... What are we doing here?
I haven't bought you a
present in a long time...
So I thought I'd do that today...
- Dude, it's a toy store...
- Yeah... So?
It's for kids...
But to me you will
always be a kid...
Mom... Should I take this for Arjun?
Yes... take it... It's
very nice... It's fantastic...
You have very good taste...
It's a fabulous dog... take it...
Dad... What did you
have for breakfast?
I don't know... I
don't remember her name...
OK... I'll take this...
God! What an awful red dog...
Just leave it...
Kamaljit... What a surprise!
Oh Samarjit... So
nice to see you here...
Of all the places in New
York we had to meet here...
Coincidence...
coincidence... Just a coincidence...
How are you?
By the way what are you doing here?
We had come here to buy a
soft toy for my grandson...
which he can cuddle
up to in the night...
Even I was looking for something
like that... And I saw you...
Neither am I soft nor am I a toy...
So please stay away...
Much as I am enjoying
this conversation...
can we please move on?
Of course... of course...
of course...
There are so many beautiful things
here... red... blue... green...
Come on darling...
help me get this one...
Don't you think that
was weird behavior?
You think he was
hitting on my mother-in-law?
Oh no... you don't need
to worry about that...
he pretty much hits
on anything that moves...
OK I'm getting late...
I have to go...
- Where are you heading?
- Work... 55th and 5th...
- Oh great... I'll walk you... Alright...
- Sure...
Sam... I think it worked...
So... what did you say
your name was?
- Charlotte...
- Charlotte... You are gorgeous!
Why are people so happy in New York?
Because they are not married...
That's why...
Right... They are single...
No tension in life... No problem...
No stress...
They go home...
shower... freshen themselves...
Watch TV... then they
go out and get lucky...
We... we go home and get unlucky...
True... We go home to a sour face...
That likes nothing...
That likes no one...
Not even us... I mean look at us...
You are super sexy...
I'm a super stud...
- But have they ever complimented us?
- Never!
All the time whine...
whine... whine...
Blah... blah... blah... blah...
- On and on and on...
- And on and on and on...
- My God how they trouble us...
- How they sadden us...
- Mock us...
- Hurt us...
Why did we marry?
I know... Our brains
were not working...
You know what?
We should be single...
Yeah... Single...
Singles rock!
- Single is the way to be...
- I wanna be single...
I wanna be single too!
- Single...
- Single...
- Single...
- Single...
- And you know what?
- What?
- We...
- Yes?
- Are lying...
- What?
I really love her...
I really love him too!
I love you Maya...
You have called me five times
since morning... What's the problem?
The problem is that my
work is such that...
I never have the time to
express my feelings...
And I keep expressing my
feelings all the time...
So what's stopping you today?
Nothing is stopping you either...
Do you like diamonds, Maya?
Diamonds?
Large, beautiful...
expensive diamonds...
Yeah of course...
Good... tell your
husband to buy them for you...
Dev...
I have bought you flowers...
Call Dev... Call him now...
OK... I'll call him if
you speak to Maya...
Why should I speak any longer?
I'm meeting you in five minutes...
Then speak to me for
four and a half minutes...
Voicemail!
Maya... I'm sulking and you
aren't even trying to make up...
Come on... Show me you care...
say or do something which
shows that you are mine...
Only mine... Maya... Miss you!
Hey Dev... Look we have to talk...
It's gone too far...
I don't want to fight any more...
If you want the same
then show me a sign...
Just a sign...
Come on let's make
this work... I love you...
See you later...
Bye...
Rhea..
Dev... You? Here?
I just got out of the station...
And these flowers?
For you...
That's sweet!
Ya. I'll see you later at home...
Yeah... Bye...
Flowers have their own language...
they say so much silently...
Right?
I asked for just one sign...
And got so many...
- Missed you...
- Yeah!
Where's Arjun?
Oh... he must have gone to
his violin class... Right?
He's quit the violin...
Quit violin? Why?
He thinks his violin is
the reason for our fights...
What an idiot I have given birth to?
Sorry Papa...
Shut up! There's no
reason to say sorry...
There's no reason to quit violin...
and there is absolutely
no reason to play football...
And that is the coach's order...
OK? Say OK...
OK...
No more football... Anyone
can play the football...
Even I can... really...
But only cool dudes
play the violin...
Right? And you are
the coolest... OK?
You can play violin as
much as you want from today...
Play it day and night...
Whenever you want...
I won't say anything...
You know why?
Why?
I'll show you...
because now I have this...
Go on play the violin...
I don't hear nothing...
Papa... Can I hug you?
What?
Can I hug you?
No... because I'm going
to hug you...
And I have another idea... We
will make an eleven member team...
You play the violin in
the forward position...
Violin doesn't have a forward...
What nonsense...
And our band will be called
Manchester United Philharmonic... OK?
Okay.
- Rishi... all this...
- May I?
I cleaned the entire house...
It took three hours... the
food's ready... really...
With these very hands I
phoned and called for food...
- But it's the thought that counts, right?
- Right...
And that's not all...
This whole weekend...
You and me... All day and
all night... for hours...
we will... with each other...
Discuss things... Whatever
you want we shall discuss...
I'm sorry Maya... For that night...
Sometimes you make
mistakes in love...
Yeah...
Dev... Who are you
talking to? Come in...
OK come on... one more...
Sorry... I couldn't
take your calls...
Rishi was with me
the whole weekend...
Don't worry... It's alright...
I tried just once...
But I got 15 missed calls...
The numbers get dialed
accidentally...
How was the weekend?
Very good... I spent a lot
of time with Rhea and Arjun...
It was fun... After
all family is family...
We even went shopping...
Rhea bought a lovely dress...
Quite sexy... Rhea
looked very good in it...
- Of course... Rhea is a beautiful woman...
- Of course! Of course!
She looks good in anything she
wears... So what did you do today?
Same as everyday...
I had lunch with George Bush and now
I'm off for coffee with Madonna...
Stupid bloody questions...
Look I don't know
what your problem is...
but I don't want
to fight with you...
Anyway I'm going out with Rishi...
There seems to be a sudden
bout of love for Rishi...?
Yeah... After all
family is family... Right?
So Rishi is taking you to meet
the rest of his family at the zoo?
Rishi is taking me to the ballet...
Ballet? Where men dance
without underwear?
Rishi likes all that stuff?
Not Rishi... I like ballet...
Ballet is music, dance,
poetry... I love the ballet...
You like strange things...
Yeah... Nothing can be
more strange than you...
Ya.
Enjoy your ballet... ballet!
Welcome to the Rachanco ballet.
- Dev... I hope you are well...
- I am... Why?
First the flowers... Now
the ballet... You all right?
I'm alright, thank you...
Maybe you are falling in love...
with me all over again...
Will you excuse me for a moment...
I will join you...
Hey... isn't that... Dev?
And... Rhea... yeah...
Hey Rhea... Are you following me?
I don't know about you guys...
but I'm following
your wife for sure...
Hey... Hey...
- Hi Rhea...
- Hi...
So how are you guys?
Oh we are good... we are good...
So even you have come
here to appease your wife?
Ballet can be so boring...
Boring? Ballet is not boring...
Ballet is music, dance, poetry...
I love the ballet...
Maya... Do you love the ballet?
Yeah... Lovely dress, Rhea...
Thank you... It's Dev's choice...
You've got very good taste...
Thank you... You look beautiful
too... But a little less than Rhea...
Just the way you look a
little less handsome than Rishi...
Oh yes...
Wow Maya! A compliment after years!
Not bad... not bad...
Same here... Dev, you need
to be taken to...
the doctor tomorrow for sure...
Come on lets go... I don't
want to miss the ballet...
I wanna pee...
Excuse me... Excuse me...
I love the ballet... Come on move...
I'm sorry...
OK... Told you he was on drugs...
What were we doing? What
were we doing last night?
We were playing with
their feelings...
For the first time I
felt hatred for myself...
How could I do this to Rishi?
Feeling bad for him?
You must have felt
guilty last night too...
So what did you do to
get rid of your guilt?
What did you do? Did you
allow him to touch you?
- Dev.
- No, no, no.
Where did he touch you?
Here? Here? Here?
Where did he touch you? Did he touch
you here? Here? Tell me. Tell me.
Stop it Dev... Just stop it...
You think I don't feel bad?
That my love spends nights with
someone else? But I bear it...
I can't bear it...
I can't bear it...
You will have to... because
our relationship is a dream...
that shatters every time we
reach home... And that's the truth...
No.
I can't accept this truth...
I can't bear it...
I can't bear it... I can't
bear to see you with him...
You are mine... Just mine...
Then how come he has
a greater right...
Your heart is mine but
you have his name...
I can't bear it...
You are mine...
Dev, what are you doing?
You are mine.
Buddy... On the eve
of your wedding...
I just want to say that
marriage is beautiful...
It gives you that special someone
who you trust more than yourself...
Trust me dude... being married
is the world's greatest feeling...
To Diva... Finally
the No.1 magazine...
OK girls from now on
we have a new policy...
No more late nights... no
more ignoring your husbands...
Trust me... what's
most important is this...
Cheers!
Rishi... I don't know
who's following whom here...
Oh who cares? I'm celebrating...
So am I...
But only you and me know the real
reason why we are celebrating...
So? Singles still rock?
Naaaaa...
Dance all night...
Wanna dance all night?
Do you feel alright?
Wanna dance all night...
Dance all night...
Wanna dance all night?
Do you feel alright?
Wanna dance all night...
Dance all night...
Wanna dance all night?

And all the loved
ones sway to the tune...

Where's the party tonight?
Weaving these dreamy days...
And dreamy nights...
Where's the party tonight?
Dance all night...
Wanna dance all night?

Wanna dance all night...
The one I dreamt of...
The one who drove me crazy...
Today he is mine...
Like the flower that
I yearned for...
Like the fragrance
that I craved for...
He has blossomed in my arms...
The path is filled
with fragrance of love...
Intoxicated are all eyes around...
Dreams weave a web around
all of us...
So let's dance all night...
Where's the party tonight?
Where's the party tonight?
Weaving these dreamy days...
And dreamy nights...
Where's the party tonight?
Dance... Dance all night.
Dance... Dance all night.
My story goes like this...
The one who I yearn for...
Has fallen for me...
The queen of my heart...
Has my story on her lips...
Happy ending is in sight...
I have got a sign...
Life dances in mirth...
So let's dance all night...
Where's the party tonight?
Where's the party tonight?
Weaving these dreamy days...
And dreamy nights...
Where's the party tonight?
Where's the party tonight?
Where's the party tonight?
Weaving these dreamy days...
And dreamy nights...
Where's the party tonight?
- Hey, Maya.
- Dad... Who's house is this?
You know Kamaljit...
It's her birthday today...
So I thought I'd
invite her for dinner...
If you are with me she
will take me more seriously...
Kamaljit?
Kamaljit... That...
Dev... Dev... Dev's mother...
Rhea... Who is it?
Many happy returns of the day...
Thank you Sam...
- Happy birthday, aunty...
- Thank you... What a surprise!
I'm full of surprises...
So how old is Chandigarh?
Beauty has no age, Sam...
Really? Anyway let's get
to the point... Kamal...
I'd like to throw a
party for you tonight...
No... I don't trust your parties...
the next thing I know
there'll be nude girls...
So you can join them too...
Just kidding... Just kidding...
- Seriously, it will just be family... Our families...
- No.
- Come on... Listen...
- No...
- hey Rhea... Come on...
- Dad!
Our wedding pictures... God,
we were so drunk...
You know what I am saying
to Dev here?
Now that the vows are made, I'll kill
you if you don't stick to them...
This one's my favourite...
When Arjun was born...
I have never seen Dev so happy...
Rhea... I'm leaving... I...
Hey Dev... Look who's here...
Hi...
Hey...
OK... All is settled...
Dinner at my place... Sharp 8...
Hi... And yes you are invited too...
But if you are busy
we shall understand...
Sam...
Just kidding sweetheart...
Bye... see you...
You seem to have settled
down here... Should we?
- Bye...
- Maya...
Can I have Dev back please?
Photo, Maya...
- Sorry...
- That's OK...
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.
Fill it up... Fill it up...
Dude... ease up on the wine...
Relax... Ladies and gentlemen...
Attention please...
I have an announcement to make...
I'm getting married...
To Kamal...
What?
That's the
expression I wanted to see...
Sam... What are you doing?
Just joking...
You know we have to do something
about your son's sense of humor...
Smile my son... Smile...
You won't die if you do...
And even if you die, you
will die with a smile...
- Wow, dad!
- Really I tell you..
- Sam... It's a five course meal with a preset menu...
- Yes, darling.
Thank you... Are you on the menu?
No... but my grandmother is...
Well done... At last there's
someone who can shut you up...
How can she talk like..
Tell me Rishi, was he always
like this or is this change recent?
He behaves like a tiger now but
he was a mouse before my mother...
Rishi... behave...
His mother was
a very strict woman...
She used to say, 'you can look...
but don't you dare touch!'
And these days there's no time
to look... Too busy touching...
Very bad...
Oh Mom... I really hope
you are not listening...
Your Mom and her rules...
It's not about rules, Mr.
Talwar... It's about limits...
It's very easy to
slip in a marriage...
It's difficult to keep control...
I personally feel every relationship
should have its boundaries...
And I believe more the boundaries...
more the chances of
them being crossed...
Well... I don't
really agree with you...
Maya you tell me...
What do you think?
Maya doesn't need to
draw any boundaries...
because her husband
loves her too much...
Flattery... Flattery...
When a man uses flattery
it only means two things...
Either he is lying or he
is hiding something...
- Really...
- Ya.
These days Dev is
flattering me a lot...
You think I need to worry...
Actually you should...
Everyone's been speaking a lot...
About relationships...
But relationships
are not about words...
they are about circumstances...
No one knows why one
slips in a relationship...
Why one falls in love
outside a relationship...
No one knows... Even I don't
know why it happened with me...
But it did...
Rhea, I am in love
with someone else...
in love with someone else.
I'm sorry Rhea but
that's the truth...
And the woman I fell in love with...
is right here...
Right here.
It's Maya...
What happened, Mr. Talwar?
No sense of humor?
I was just joking...
- Dev... That really wasn't funny...
- No?
- I was going to kill you...
- It was very funny.
I was going to kill him before you...
You are a bit crazy...
Good joke... Good joke...
What was wrong with you last night?
What were you saying?
You said whatever you felt like...
Did you think of me even once
while saying all those things?
Now who will answer
Rishi's questions?
You... Who else? Just tell him
the truth... I don't care...
Tell him the truth? Then what Dev?
Leave the house? And come to you?
Will you leave Rhea
and your son? Tell me...
- No... I don't think so...
- I thought so...
- Maya... Maya, one minute.
- Don't..
- Dev don't touch me... Dev... just leave me.
- Maya..
Dev, just leave me..
You were right Dev...
You never know what you'll get
to see outside this station...
Let's go...
It's all so dirty... Not
been cleaned for so many days...
Will you have coffee?
What were you saying?
Coffee? No... This Rishi... he
just keeps anything anywhere...
he's moved everything around...
Dad you'll have tea?
Oh... you never have tea...
I'm crazy...
What am I saying? Just
need to clean all this...
You are late?
Yes... Too late...
Dude...
Any message for Mom?
- Rishi...
- Maya...
I wanted to apologise Dad...
But apologies are for mistakes...
What's the punishment
for selfishness?
I'm a father...
I can't punish...
I can only advice...
Leave Rishi...
You don't love him...
By being with him like this...
you are keeping him
away from his true love...
And yourself too...
These incomplete relationships
will bring happiness to no one...
Dad!
It's not your fault, Maya...
Love and death...
both come uninvited...
No one has any control over them...
He's going away...
He's not going to make it...
I don't want to lose my Dad, Maya...
Thank God I have you...
Chandigarh...
We knew this was the
end of our journey...
These were the last few
breaths of our love story...
We had to collect these moments...
and breathe a new life
into our old relationships...
It was time to go home...
We had to tell Rishi
and Rhea the truth...
Because happiness can never
bloom in the shadow of lies...
No one knew this better than us...
Rhea...
There's another woman in my life...
That's not funny any more...
I'm not joking...
For the last six months...
But it's over now...
Maya...
Why it happened...
I don't have any answers...
But I want to..
Give our marriage
another chance...
Do you love her?
How does it matter?
It matters to me...
If I had to do what you did...
would you forgive me?
You wouldn't, Dev... You
would never forgive me...
You will have to leave this house..
This marriage is over...
Rishi... Listen to me...
Listen to me... Rishi... Rishi...
Rishi..
Rishi..
Did you sleep with him?
You slept with him? Tell me Maya...
How was it?
Was it fun? Did you
have fun? Tell me...
Was it fun? Did you have fun?
Rishi.
Tell me...
How strange Maya that you kept
cleaning this house all the time
and today you have
brought in so much filth...
- Don't say that, Rishi...
- Then what should I say?
What should I do?
Celebrate?
Should I celebrate that my
wife is sleeping with another man?
I'm sorry Rishi... I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
Why did you do this..
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you do this..
I'm sorry.
Why did you do this to me, Maya?
I loved you so much...
More than my own self...
More than life...
But it wasn't enough for you, right?
It's not like that Rishi...
Then how is it, Maya?
You know..
Every morning I woke up
to look into your eyes...
To search for my face...
But now I will only see him.
And I will not be able
to bear that...
But that
relationship is over, Rishi...
This relationship is over, Maya...
Rishi..
Then I'll leave...?
I won't stop you...
Try not to hate me, Arjun...
Please.
Rhea... I want to
say something to you...
Dev didn't ask me before
stepping out of this marriage...
Neither did you ask me
before throwing him out...
But my grandson's eyes ask me
whether I'm going to leave him...
I can't do that Rhea...
So if you have no objections...
I would like to stay with you...
Can I?
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Dev...
Maya...
Yeah... Got dialed by mistake...
Are you OK?
Did you... Tell Rishi... Rishi?
I told Rishi everything...
What did he say?
He was very angry at first...
But with time I know
he will forgive me...
He's a good man...
And Rhea?
Even she will forgive me with time...
After all family is family...
Yeah... Family is family...
Yeah Rhea... I'm coming...
Even I am at home... with Rishi...
Be happy.
Goodbye...
All our relationships were
defined by this one word...
Both of us left our homes and didn't
even tell each other about it...
I had never seen the
hope of meeting again..
Die such a silent death before...
Your heart knows...
And so does mine...
That our roads are meant to part...
Far apart though we will be...
Please don't go away
from my memories...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
- Hi Good morning.
- Hi Miss.
I am going to be your
new teacher from today.
My name is Maya Tal...
My name is Maya.
All the mirth in life
has slipped away slowly...
It's the pain that
refuses to go away...
Tried to wish it away...
tried to laugh it away...
But the heart fails to find peace...
fails to find peace...
Are these tears? Or is it cinder?
Just fire that flows
freely from my eyes...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Seasons come... and seasons go...
But the season of
pain is here to stay...
The shade of sorrow is so deep...
That it will take a while to pale...
Who knows what's to happen ahead...
Who knows what's in
store for us to bear...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Your heart knows...
And so does mine...
That our roads are meant to part...
Far apart though we will be...
Please don't go away
from my memories...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Never say goodbye...
Thanks...
Do you know Maya that in these three
years I tried hard to hate you...
To forget you... but I couldn't...
couldn't do it, Maya...
You gave up the house but the
house could never give you up...
You were right... I was a child...
I could never understand you..
And that I realize today...
I have grown up, Maya...
I am in love again...
I'm getting married...
Won't you say anything?
I'm very happy for you...
I really am.
Her name is Catherine...
And I want you to be the
best man at my wedding, Maya...
Ya?
I don't have anyone besides you..
You are my family...
Always have been...
always will be...
This is for you.
Dad!
Wherever he is... he is with us...
he is with you...
Jai... I'm not ready yet...
I am being a mother to
my son after many years...
At this point I'm happy with
this one relationship... And...
You don't have to say anything...
I just want you to know
that I'll be waiting... OK?
Excuse me!
I'm sorry... I just
came to say 'Bye'...
Rhea... You just get ready...
I'll wait for you outside...
And good luck with
your job in Canada...
Thank you.
He's.. He's..
What time is your train?
In two hours...
Arjun...
I know... I met Mom...
He probably forgot that
I was leaving today...
Rhea...
I have lost my right to
ask you for forgiveness...
but I don't want to
lose the right to bless you...
If it's..
Have a good life...
You stay in touch...
I will.
I will.
God Rhea... We are really late...
I'm so sorry Jai...
Don't worry about it...
Catherine..
Jai... I'm going to kill you...
You missed the ceremony...
Not my fault,
sweetheart... Blame it on Rhea...
Congratulations...
Rhea... It's so nice
to finally meet you...
Jai talks about you all the time...
Well I hope good things...
Of course... You haven't
met my husband... Sweetheart?
Come meet my oldest friend
in the world... This is...
- Rhea...
- Rishi?
Great... You know each other?
Yes... We do...
Congratulations...
You are a lucky man...
- Thank you...
- Jai you are never going to believe who's in town...
Honey... we'll see
you later... Rhea...
See you in a bit...
Rishi? Your wedding?
What about Maya?
Maya and I separated
three years ago...
And you here? With Jai?
Dev and I divorced three years ago...
But do Dev and Maya know this?
Maya...
What's the matter Maya?
Can't look me in the eye...
can't face me...
Because you broke my heart? My home?
How could you break something
that was already broken, Maya?
Maybe you shouldn't have filled
the void between Dev and me...
But what could you do?
Dev's love is like that...
Ask me... I know...
Don't be so large-hearted
Rhea that I feel even smaller...
I'm not that magnanimous...
When Dev told me
about you I left him...
But I don't think you know that...
How strange! The love that
changed the destinies...
of two homes
today stands destitute...
I moved on... Rishi moved on...
The two of you got left behind...
Perhaps that's our punishment...
Such a small punishment?
Try living with Dev... Then you
will know what punishment is...
OK... I had to fight
fifty women for this...
It's tradition...
the girl who gets these
flowers gets a new life...
new happiness... And I
want that girl to be you, Maya...
Your heart has been
searching for love for many years...
and that love is Dev...
And if you don't hurry now your love
will move further away from you...
Dev is leaving for Toronto... His
train leaves in fifteen minutes...
Go Maya... Go get your
love before it's too late...
Go...
Thank you...
And Rhea?
Even she will forgive me with time...
Maya!
Aren't you a little
overdressed for the station?
Sorry.
It's been a while hasn't it?
I don't live here any more...
And I don't live here
despite being here...
Watch where you are going!
Nothing is changed Dev... You
still get angry at everything...
Anger's my own...
Doesn't leave me...
Love can always leave and go...
What will you do if
you find your lost love?
What will I say now, Maya...
I'll just say 'go back'!
Dev...
Only I know how I have
survived these three years...
There was not a moment in the
day when I didn't think of you...
But I used to convince
myself that you are alright...
you are happy with your family...
I used to think of your happiness..
And it would reduce a
bit of my unhappiness...
But today I realized..
That you have been
as alone as I am...
Yes Dev...
Even I have been
alone for three years...
Alone... Like you...
Why Dev?
Why did all this happen? Why?
Why did we meet? And
then part? Why, Dev? Why?
Why?
Everyone shares
happiness and sorrow...
I want to share my
punishment with you...
My life may not be
complete living with you...
but at least it will
be a life...
Will you share this
incomplete life with me Maya...
Answer me Maya... It's hurting...
Answer...
I can't sit here the whole...
What do you want me to do?
Go down on my knees?
Shut up... Just shut up...
Speak politely...
OK... Hello... Thank you...
Nice to meet you...
I love you... Dammit!
I love you too...
Damn this leg!
- Now?
- Now what? Fifteen days in jail...
What?
Yeah... I stopped the
train by pulling the chain...
Why are you wearing
this silly sari?
The foundation of a
marriage should only be love...
And nothing else...
because if the foundation is wrong,
relationships end...
Like it happened with us...
Years later, we found love...
Happiness...
But we just wish that...
the road to our destination...
didn't have to be
paved with broken hearts...
