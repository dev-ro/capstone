Tarkalal, is everything ready?
-Perfectly under control.
Chacha Thakur they`ve come
Why are you so anxious
See if Muscan is ready
This is very respectable
family so behave properly
Don`t worry dad.
I`ll handle it
You must have learnt from
rejection by 100 familles.
Hi Thakur sahib, namaste.
You`re having a grand
lifestyle here.
We`ve worked a little
rest is by the grace of God
He is my son Balvinder.
He is a bit...
Quite a bit. Please come in.
You had no problem finding
this place?
Of course not. Everybody
knows you around here.
That`s why we are here.
Would you have something?
Thakur sahib you know
why we have come here.
Certainly.
Ujala, bring Muscan here.
My son likes Muscan.
What`s your opinion?
Let me ask Muscan.
How do you like Dev Anand?
My liking or disliking is of no consequence.
First let them meet Vishal bhaiya.
Yes Vishal has to make decision.
Here comes Vishal.
They`ve proposed for Muscan.
-Yes.
People call me Biloo.
Biloo - don`t move too much.
Don`t worsen the situation.
-What`s your problem?
I can come to this family
only after Muscan`s marriage.
Uncle may I show our estate
to my would be brother-in-law.
No, no Vishal...
-Yes, yes...
Let two of them go Thakur sahib.
-Two will go, one will return.
Come on.
-Let`s go.
He`ll play the band.
-Band is part of the ceremony.
I`m afraid he might play
it right now.
Don`t worry Thakur
everything will be fine.
By now my Biloo and your Vishal
would have become buddies.
You don`t know my Biloo`s talking,
skills. Vishal will become his fan.
Why haven`t they come back?
Perhaps they are deciding
about the marriage.
Here they are coming.
But I don`t see Biloo!
I had told you
two will go, one will return.
What happened to you
my son?
Dad he showed me estate
from all angles...
from top to bottom, inside the
bush, from the treetop.
Oh, he is so badly scratched.
If you did not like my son
you should have said so.
I`d no idea he would be
so badly disfigured.
Let`s go Balvinder.
-Call me Biloo.
Boy was neither to your liking nor
mine, but why did you beat him?
What if his arms or legs
had broken.
I picked this Rakhi for brother.
How do you like it?
It`s good, but it is sister`s
festival - why are you asking me?
Who knows, you may have to tie
Rakhi to my brother some day.
Shut up. Never say this.
-You love affair is admirable...
brother doesn`t care about you,
but you always dreaam about him.
I dream too, but not in sleep.
I dream with my eyes open.
And I only dream about you.
-Really?
Yes, but how long will your
brother refuse your sultors?
Doesn`t he wants to get
you married?
What can he do? It is
hard to find a good match.
I`m available. Tell your
brother you like me.
If he proposes you to my family
the marriage would materialize.
Why don`t you say it to him?
-I would have said, but your
Really?
-Yes.
Finished talking?
-Yes I`m finished.
Baby you go home.
Any mischief again, your head will
be in with feet dangling out.
He turned off my light!
Brother...
I`m here baby.
Oh you`re here.
I looked for you everywhere.
Forget what ever happened.
We`ve nothing to do with them.
I can`t tolerate anybody
insulting you.
Now stop talking
have some food.
You cooked it?
Yes.
It`s very tasty.
Brother...
Wake-up brother.
Let me sleep baby.
Brother, please wake-up...
-Why?
Because today is sisters` day
and you`ve to do what I say.
Oh yes, it is Rakhi today.
-Had you forgotten.
How can I forget?
I live for this day.
Give me your hand.
May God bestow
all the happiness.
Just blessings won`t
suffice this year.
I`m going to ask for
something special!
What?
I want to go to Bombay.
Bombay? Why?
Because I want to
move with modern times.
I want to go to the city
for higher studies.
/Vishal - take care of Muscan
/like your daughter...
/Give her whatever she wants.
/-Son! Don`t let her miss us.
/She has no one except you.
Okey.
-Thank you brother. You`re great.
Friends! I`ve neither a
destination nor a companion.
Yet I`ve started from home
scarching someone...
To be my companion.
To be my destination.
/Oh my soulmate

Brother...
Can`t you see?
I can see darling - I bumped in to
you because you are so handsome.
Do we go brother?
Muscan you want to have
education in this jungle?
This is not a jungle brother
this is city`s best college.
That`s whay I see more animals
than human beings here.
Here`s the principal`s office -
smile please.
Chacha Thakur`s niece - I was
expecting you. Fill this form.
And he is?
-My elder brother.
Elder brother take the load off
your shoulders and have a seat.
In this college we put load
on brain not on shoulders.
Are you talking about loading
brains of empty-headed students?
Have textile mills closed that
girls don`t cover their bodies?
Can`t you see?
-Yes I can see. Have a seat.
Ornaments are for girls but boys
wear them - can`t you see?
Surely I can see.
Students smoke as if this is a
cigarette factory - can`t you see?
Yes friend I can see.
So why don`t you do something?
What can I do?
This is modern culture.
This culture must change now.
Baby is coming to study here.
Father`s name Vishal Thakur...
mother`s name Vishal Thakur too?
Vishal is my elder brother`s name.
After death of our parents
He has brought me up - he has
sacrificed his happiness for me.
My brother is everything for me.
-Understand? Let`s go.
Before you go I want to
tell you something.
Seeing your affection for each
other reminds of my sister.
I used to love her like you -
and I too used to harass people...
I mean counsel people.
But one day she fell in love
with a boy -
married him and ran away.
-Finished talking?
Perhaps I said something wrong!
You should not have talked
to him like this.
Do you know he is the head of
the college. He is principal.
Is your principal more
important than your brother?
No, for me nobody is more
important than my brother.
If you want anything, you don`t
need to write or phone
Just remember me and
I will come to you.
Okey?
- Okey.
Stop, where can you run from me.
- Help...
Hey Suraj please help me.
- Bullder! why are you beating her.
Suraj she threw eggs over me.
Did you throw eggs over him?
Come in front of me
So why did you throw eggs?
-I was just ragging him.
Ragging is for newcomers,
not your old friends.
And remember this our last and
final year in the college.
If wee pass!
What happened Suraj?
Nothing.
But something has happened.
Look at me.
Come on look at me.
Oh! She ignored you...
so insulting...
I can make her run after me
in a couple of minutes.
Do you want to bet?
Say five hundred...
Fifty thousand...
-One thousand
Only five second left...
no trace of Suraj.
Don`t look at your watch
look ahead!
That`s Suraj`s charisma.
Lost the bet.
Please listen.
Oh.
Why did you bring me to library?
What is the matter?
What is the matter?
Whatever she thinks about me,
but I feel attracted to her.
About whom?
- About her.
But who is she?
That girl with purse.
Which girl?
- One I was running from...
Really! And we thought she
was running after you.
That`s one and same thing.
I don`t understand 
you tell me later.
Look at me so that
I can explain.
She had a bag like this 
I picked it and run.
I was explaining her about the bag.
-I fully understand you.
No problem.
Here she comes.
My name is Ritu.
- Muscan
How do you like our college?
Okey.
And the people?
Quite interesting.
- friends!
Eleven runs - well played...
I don`t know much about cricket
but is 11-run score good?
It`s good because none of our
players were out at zero.
Didn`t you get money.
- Yes. I got it.
Why are you playing so good?
I`m habitually a good player.
Never played for money before.
It`s for money today - play well
and get out promptly.
Our team is being defeated and
Suraj is laughing with batsman!
Team spirit
- you won`t understand.
What is this Tal about?
- I explained - it`s team spirit.
Hey, stop moving your buttocks
I get disterbed.
I`m not moving, it`s the breeze
which makes them move.
Umpire
- Hey, stop moving.
How can our player field
without moving?
He is moving with intent to
disturb my player.
He is best player of our team.
He`ll move as he likes.
If he moves
there will be no match.
How can you stop the match?
- No match.
Move away from me.
- Don`t touch my tie.
What`re you doing? principals were
made umpires to avoid any problem.
Now you`re fighitng. You should
set a good example for students.
Hey, where are you lost?
- Right here sir.
You stop moving. Batsman you stop
looking. You take your positions.
See, our captain settled
everything in minutes.
Isn`t Sonu looking at us?
- Could be a part of our game plan.
Enjoying? Our captain has made
it so interesting.
Haven`t you been paid?
I`m not for sale.
Oh, you`re one of those.
Last man, last wicket, last run
our defeat is certain.
He could not settle with batsman!
What?
Where is the shield. Handshake
can wait. Give shield - we won.
Congratulation.
Shake hands with her.
How much did you
pay to buy the team?
What did she say?
- That we played very well.
I`m the principal
of your college.
Muscan I want talk to you.
- I`ve no time to listen to you.
I`ll show you.
Oh, what are you doing?
People are watching.
Stop it.
Good you told me everything
about yourself.
Like you I`m very mischievous in my
home, but I`ve a good heart.
So you`re no longer angry with me.
- Who said I was angry?
What`s this Suraj?
Compensation.
- Compensation?
My dad sends lot of love to me
on first day of every month.
Muscan, I`ve an urgent errand to run, can I go.
I had mention lot of love -
this is it.
Where can it go?
Search all drawers of the cabinet.
A 2,500,000 necklace
can`t vanish like this.
Mom you never called me your son,
and today you called me a thief.
Why are you afraid if they
search your room.
I`m not afraid, I`m sad.
Doesn`t all this belong to me.
Yes, of course.
- I`ve equal right in this property
I`m your father`s wife -
this makes me your mother.
Necklace is not in this room.
- Okey, search over there.
Daddy, you searched my room, now
ask them to search her room too.
See your son thinks I`m a thief...
why will I steal my own necklace?
It`s not necklace, it`s the
matter of losing and winning.
What do you want to say Suraj?
That she is not my mother -
she is my stepmother.
Suraj!
Daddy, your life long problem is
you leave everything unfinished.
I must move out for the happiness
of this family.
But where will you go?
Without trying to stop me
you`re asking my destination.
Not fair! why didn`t you
run after me.
For me bag has no value
to make me run after it.
What about me?
Don`t you know how
to play the game?
Every time you resort
to your vulgar gestures.
Suraj why don`t you play?
- I don`t like these foolish games.
Hear him
- Come on I`ll play with you.
Hey, look! Suraj lost.
what? what did I do?
You winked...
What? Tell me - what did I do?
Say it!
Hey button - you won`t gain
height by eating.
Fatty - eating will reduce you.
Do you know big film stars are coming on college`s annual function
We know.
- How?
We`ve invited them.
You?
I mean Suraj.
- Do you know these film stars?
They are his underwear friends.
- We used to exchange under-wears.
I`ve seen them only on the screen.
Now you can see them
face to face.
Suraj can I meet once?
- Why once - ten times.
And one autograph?
- You can have autobiography.
Brothers and girlfriends.
- Hey... call them sisters.
I`m presenting great actors who
have brought prestige to India.
Suraj, do I look good?
May I go now.
And for our Anil Kapoor sahib...
at least one clap!
This is called annuual function -
not one at your college.
I know yuo`ve seen them
only on the screen.
They`re very friendly.
You may ask any question.
Mr. Sanjay we know you`re innocent.
When RADA of TADA will free you.
Only God knows. Accusers may want
worse but God will save me.
Your prayers are with me.
Mr. Khanna you were hero in films.
why did you become zero in politics?
Dear friends it`s decision of
public and public knows better.
My question is for Rajni Kant.
- He is from South... no Hindi.
Please let me ask one question.
- Okey go ahead.
May I ask a question Shatruji?
- Yes sure.
You started clapping. First let
me ask the question.
I am your great fan - seen all your
movies - first day, first show...
now that new boys have taken over
how do you feel about them?
Great!
Quiet.
How can these kids take my place.
Have you lost sight with age?
You see Khanna as a kid.
You`ve lost your throne
but not your pride.
Control your tongue
otherwise...
Otherwise you`ll go
to my father.
Yes That`s where he`ll go -
he is your father`s age.
You`ve been burnt
not changed your behavior.
You`ve twisted back
but you`re still proud.
Why are they fighting Suraj?
- They are just acting.
You must seek forgiveness
from Kaka and me, otherwise...
You`re threatening
Suleman Pasha.
Quiet.
come on octopus.
Quiet.
How dare you touch me.
Quiet.
Hey weakling, I will blow you away.
You called me weakling.
- What`re you guys doing?
You duplicate of Salman.
Was he Salman`s duplicate?
- How can they bring original.
Look at the man before you talk.
He is not duplicate
He is the organizer, we have to
get money from him. You go sir.
All of them are duplicate.
- Hit them.
What`s all this?
- Muscan I did this to impress you.
And I shook their hands.
Oh man avoid tension.
How can I? principal wants to
meet my parents about stars night.
What is the difficulty?
Call your parents.
They haven`t met me in two years -
why will they meet the principal.
Give it a thought Suraj.
What will happen?
I`ve done my part...
Now you think about it.
If had brains to think, we would
not be in same class for 3 years.
This means my
college days are over.
How dare you become the principal?
You have harassed my son!
Don`t you know who I am?
- Who are you?
I`m Suraj Khanna`s mother.
If I want I can buy this
college overnight...
and sell it in a day.
Suraj, come on my son.
Look son who has come to see you.
Who?
- Your mother.
Mom! It`s you.
Have a seat son.
Principal has troubled you.
Yes.
- No.
I think I should have another
college constructed for you.
Here is my checkbook. I want to
pay for my son`s mistakes.
Is it okey son.
Well done my - I mean mom.
Why are you both
laughing like this.
You have troubled my son enough.
Now tell me what`s your decision.
I have decided madam. From today
this college belongs to your son.
If it was up to me I would
give this city to Suraj.
Let`s go son.
- Just a minute.
I want to tell you something
before you go.
Your love for each other
reminds of my mother
Mom
- Take this.
She used to love me like this.
She use to pay for my mistakes.
I can understand your pain.
- Don`t take out more.
My son.
- You tricked the principal.
You know today she
tricked the principal.
What happened?
- Ask what did not happen.
She so cleverly hoodwinked him
none of us can.
If she had not helped your
hero would not be in college.
Suraj she is laughing so
she is an easy prey.
Good chance to say
whatever is in your heart.
Should I say?

When I left army for my children
I didn`t know that
I will have to face a war
in my own village.
Attack...
Vishal - did I hurt you?
In anger I didn`t realize
it was you
Hold a minute - I know how
to handle him.
Show me your hand.
It is stronger than mine.
Oh papa! My back is in pieces.
- What happened my son?
Why are you crying?
- Both of them hit me badly.
They`re in full control of land.
Forget about the fields.
Are you wearing shoes?
- Of course.
Let`s run away from this village.
- Shut up.
See Vishal and Thakur have
physically assaulted us.
Undue advantage of their strength.
Now we are going to lose our land.
It`s enough, we must take this
to panchayat.
Yes papa you must take this
matter to panchayat.
Where are we going uncle?
- To panchayat.
What?
Gajraj is trying to grab our land.
I`ll beat him in front of village
leaders if he causes mischief.
No don`t get excited. Panchayat
has certain rules.
Fifteen years ago I bought land
from Thakur`s elder brother...
but they have not given me
its possession so far.
That was our land and
it will remain with us.
Entire village know that
I never lie.
I don`t know much about you
but you`re a good actor.
Why are you wasting
panchayat`s time?
You`re taking adventage of time by
coming after your brother`s death
to grab all his land.
- Hey. Finished talking. Now Listen.
He has done more than our parents.
To bring us up, uncle didn`t marry
sacrificed his happiness. We are
indebted to him more than the land.
Do you understand papa?
- Vishal, sit down my son.
I promise to give land if Gajraj
shows any proof of purchase.
Hearing both parties panchayat
decides in favor of Thakur sahib.
Try to break our family again and
I`ll punish you not the panchayat.
Papa have your pants up,
it`ll be easy to run.
No, no... it`ll not happen
How and when will it happen...
What`s it
- Uncle he`s talking with himself.
Only Muscan used to talk. She is
gone - so I talk to myself.
Finished talking?
- Yes.
What`s the matter Vishal.
Do you miss Muscan?
I`m going to Delhi.
You can also go to see Muscan.
Are you going to city?
- Yes.
To meet with Muscan?
- Yes.
Give it to Muscan.
- Okey.
What will happen to me?
I haven`t seen a greater
coward than you.
I`m giving flowers for the first
time. What if she rejects.
Are you deaf.
Didn`t you hear what she said.
There is consent
hidden in her denial.
Okey come on, why I`m delaying?
- Come on.
How dare you?
- Suraj try to understand he is my...
We can take care of him.
Go my hippopotamus... charge...
You`ve a body!
He is very strong.
Don`t get beaten in front of all.
Think about our prestige.
Prestige is not above my life.
He attacked from back.
He has beaten us so much,
give him at least two bumps.
Okey, my two bumps
will equal fifty.
Can`t you do
something about it?
Hey Muscan! Who is
this big item?
That`s what I was trying to say.
He is my elder brother.
Let`s go.
Hey elder brother.
Kindly listen to me.
I hear my elders and equals.
I just want to say that I...
- Finished talking?
One more word and I`ll wrap your
tongue around your neck.
Excuse me sir, kindly listen...
- You listen, if you can`t remember
note it down that if you try to
meet Muscan, I`ll finish you.
He gave tremendous beating,
my body has been de-shaped.
This brother-sister love is strange
When in the second round
I was about to beat him, Muscan just whisked him away.
Please hear what I`ve to say
- What more should I hear?
They had no idea that
you`re my brother.
I`m to blame. If I had told them
that I`ve an over protective
brother, then as in the village,
I couldn`t have any friends.
Finished talking? You had come for
studies not for making friends.
First time in life I made good
friends - you fought with them.
Wrong. He started the fight,
I only finished it.
Poor Suraj (sun).
- It was sunset.
Come on everybody,
bus will leave now.
Give this to me sir.
Baby, You`ve to go this way.
- come on, be quick.
Oh my in-law, my way goes
wherever you`ll go.
Ujala!
It`s okey.
What`re you doing here?
Waiting.
- And I was searching you at home.
Papa. Learn to live alone. After
sometime I`ll live in this house.
Not until they find
a good boy for Muscan.
Bhanu do you go to Thakur sahib`s
farm house every day?
Yes, otherwise I can`t develop such
muscles by eating at dad`s hotel.
What`s up dud?
- He is Dhoodwala, I`m Tongawala.
Is horse-cart empty?
- Do you see anybody?
No.
- Then jump in and tell the address
Thakur sahib`s home.
- Then my cart is not empty.
Are you related to Thakur sahib?
- No, but I will be.
Do you mean with Thakur`s sister?
You may be keen to have your
bones broken but I`ve no such
intention and if he finds out
that I took you there then 
I will go from this world.
You see that hill, there is a river
behind it which passes through
his farmhouse. You may swim or sink
we will read in paper, give me 25.
25 rupees?
10 for address, 15 for dressing.
I have taken so much risk.
I don`t have small bills.
- Crazy man.
/Like a crazy I`m going
/In search of my love
/Lovely sights, magnificent sky
/Universe in joy, delightful weather
/Like a crazy I`m going
/In search of my love
/She`ll be bashful. She`ll be timid
/Closer she comes,won`t let her go
/In the shadows of her hair
/We will embrace each other
/Like a crazy I`m going
/In search of my love
Nobody knows Vishal better then
you, yet you had a boyfriend.
I don`t know how
all this happened.
Friendship or love?
Forget him. After being beaten
he would have forgotten you too.
Tell me Muscan, is Suraj
about 5 feet 10 inch tall?
Fair color?
- Yes.
Big eyes?
- Yes.
But how do you know
so much about him?
Because I`m seeing him.
- What?
No... no.
I`m coming.
Hi.
- What`s this madness Suraj?
If Vishal sees you...
- I`ve come to see him.
You don`t know my brother.
- I`ve come to know him.
You`ve come after a long journey
and you`ve started working.
Suraj, try to understand please.
This time is not for understanding.
This time is for explaining.
Do as I say, go back. I`m afraid
if something happens to you...
Do you love me Muscan?
Yes.
- Lovers don`t fear
Big brother.
Vishal, let him go, leave him.
- Stop.
One minute - please listen.
I`m surprised that
I`ve come here for Muscan.
I know you love her and you
can do anything to protect her.
And I don`t claim to be
the best match for her.
But I`ll make her happy
because I love her very much.
Just give me one chance.
Just one chance.
- Finished talking?
Come with me.
Let`s go.
I`ve been trying to convince
him that I love Muscan...
but words don`t cross his scalp
he can`t understand.
You go back. Go back home.
You`ve everything.
Everything... except Muscan.
This road will take me to city
to all luxuries of life.
That will take me to Muscan
and tortures by her brother.
Here I`ve father`s wealth,
there Muscan`s true love.
Here is old boring routine,
and there is my destination.
Hey, are you blind or
a drunk driver.
Never seen you before here.
- I`m from another state.
But everyone has some
destination.
I know my destination
but it`s hard to reach there.
If you`ve a destination it is
difficult to find your way.
I had accident but you appear
to be more disturbed than me.
It`s not like that sir.
- Then why this long face?
Sadness doesn`t look good
on your lovely face.
You extended your hand
it`s a great gesture.
Can`t I bring smile (muskaan)
in your life.
That`s why I`ve come here.
Don`t be disappointed. I`ve learnt
everything is fair in love and war.
You`ve inspired me to stay here
till I`m successful.
You can stay with us.
On one condition - you`ll
let me share your work.
Why not. This is our house.
- But why is it so dark here?
Often light goes off.
I`m here uncle.
- You`ve come back?
How is baby?
- She is fine. She`s also come.
You`ve come so late in the night.
- I`d a minor accident.
Have you been hurt?
- No, absolutely not.
He`ll live with us for some
days. Arrange for his stay.
He is Suraj and our Muscan.
Come inside.
Luck has brought him again,
there must be something in it.
I understand your anger. You had
to hide it because of me...
but can`t you give some time to understand Suraj.
He is good. I know you love me,
but I like Suraj very much.
Is this what you like.
- Yes.
Okey.
What will happen Ujala. Brother
took Suraj to show the estate.
What if Suraj also runs away
like Biloo.
Don`t know what Vishal
would have made of Suraj.
Don`t worry your city boy
will handle him correctly.
Today you will work
with this people
And you will cook food today.
Okey, now you go.
Now we will have
best cooking.
Ask Tarkalal to bring food.
I`m very hungry.
Tarkalal is not here.
I gave him a day off.
Who`ll cook today?
- Suraj.
Ujala.
- Yes uncle.
This is my foot baby.
What happened to you?
Here I come with enjoyable food
it has taste you`ll remember.
This is your diet food.
Carrot and a tall of fish.
Cheese in spinach for uncle.
Chicken bites for colonel.
Very... very...
- Good, isn`t it?
You`ve cooked very good.
Food is very good.
I`m tolerating you
because of your sister.
Just one phone call
and you will be cut to pieces.
What is this vulgarity?
- It`s love.
Love, and with you.
Some day you will...
- Finished talking? Now listen.
Stop your indecent behavior...
we`re no longer kids.
Why don`t you understand this,
we are not kids.
Restrain your
youthful emotions.

Is Suraj living in pony shade?
- Yes uncle.
Why?
Baby is living in the home.
Sometimes you act like old man.
He`s a good boy, but as you like.
I`ve been waiting for you.
I had to come without
alerting my brother.
What? Your bloody brother.
- Hey!
Never talk foul about
my brother.
You always take sides
with your brother.
I`m his biggest responsibility
and he loves me.
Yes, you`re right. His love is
love - my love is worthless.
Don`t try to be too
emotional about it.
Yes, in a sense you`re right
I`ve no value.
Leaving everything I`ve come
here as a visiting tourist.
You don`t realize how much
tension we have because of you.
Because of me or because
of that bull.
Finished talking?
She too? But it sounds
good from her mouth.
/I`m attracted, so is my heart
/Because you`re so different
/Be careful, love can shock you
/Because my brother dislikes you
/My brother could make
/You fill water pots
/If I want your brother would be
/Roaming from door to door
/If he messes I`ll hang from feet
/Because I`m so different
/I`ve decided to get you
/Evev if he breaks his head
/I`m with you my love
/To fight with the world
/You`ve to convince my brother
/Remember this by heart
/This is a lovely village
/I`m attracted towards it
Elder brother I think I should
settle her after marriage.
Live or dead.
Hi village belles...
What was this behavior?
- What behavior?
These girls are not my type.
- What`s your type?
Get off
- stop...
You`ll be my brother-in-law.
Who are you?
- Thakur Vijay Singh.
This is not your fight...
this is our fight.
Thakur`s fight is my fight.
How many people will you kill?
- Only you.
I`ll see you.
I`ll see you.
Come on I`ll drop you home.
Come inside.
- Next time. We`ll meet again.
Be careful. You`re new here.
You made enemies by saving me.
If I made enemies
I also found a friend like you.
She`s my kid sister.
Okay. I`ll go now.
What`re you eating? Beans?
He makes me sleep behind you.
Stop it and let me sleep.
Wants me to do night shift.
Didn`t I tell you to watch
the fields during night.
Yes, so?
- So what`re you doing here?
I`m going my dad.
- Keep this cane for protection.
What`s it Muscan,
you look so happy?
Thakur Amar Singh is coming
to see Ujala tomorrow.
Why is he coming?
She is no longer a child
she`s grown up like me.
Is it so?
They`re settling the marriage.
Won`t you`ll come tomorrow?
- What shall I do there?
What are you saying brother?
Ujala is made for you.
What?
I mean she`s grown up with you.
She has grown up with me
in a way we`re her relatives.
You be her relative not me
- Yes, but we got to see
the nature of boy, whather he
will keep her happy or not.
Okay, I`ve work to do tomorrow
so I`ll go. Good night.
Any tension brother?
How many kilograms does
your daughter weight?
What`re you asking? She is my
daughter, not a lamb.
Col. uncle matrimonial ads
include girl`s weight and height.
What are they saying?
- Nothing Thakur sahib.
It`s insult of Thakur
Veer Bahadur Amar Singh Rathore.
As you say Thakur Veer Bahadur
Amar Singh Rathore.
Forgive them, they are ashamed
spit your anger sir.
Should I spit?
Here comes the bull.
May I`ve his introduction?
looks like girl`s maternal uncle.
Your father would be
her maternal uncle.
How can that be?
Don`t do something which might
ruin my daughter`s life.
Hey soldier, look at me...
what`re you whispering about?
Sir he is our younger Thakur.
- So he is smaller than us.
Can we talk about
important matters?
Sir we are small fries
in comparison to you.
I`m unable to give dowry.
Nobody takes dowry in his family.
- We give dowry.
Col. uncle are you so down to
give your girl to these bats.
This is our insult.
- What`re you doing brother?
Hey go away I`ve seen your kind.
- What are you doing Vishal?
If they go away who will
marry my daughter?
What`s wrong with your
daughter we can find many?
It`s you who always finds
faults in her.
Hey, leave her hand
- You shut up.
If he leaves her hand, will you
take her hand in marriage?
Will you?
Tell them brother.
Speak up small Thakur.
Even biger people than him can`t
compete with my personality.
What`s your answer Vishal?
- I`ll hold your hand.
Hey, he said it.
- Elder brother!
What`s Suraj?
You`re massaging me so nicely.
Do you know sir - a big Thakur
came to propose to Ujala?
Yes I know.
- And Vishal run him out.
You know his temper.
It shows Vishal is in
love with Ujala.
He loves her very much.
Can`t you talk to Col. and
arrange their marriage.
No use. He won`t marry until
he finds a good boy for Muscan.
That means Vishal will select
a boy for Muscan, not you.
I know they will not
oppose my choice...
but I`ve given this
right to Vishal.
What`s the matter?
- A little pain in my neck.
Let me massage your neck.
- No sir.
Your mood is off,let me tell
you a joke - one day when...
What is all this - a joke?
No, this is test.
What`s this madness - how can
he control this wild horse...
Wild horse!
Stammer but use correct grammar.
Who asked him to ride this
rotten horse - your mischief?
No uncle, he thinks he is
a great horse tamer.
Why are you hitting me
with hind legs.
I know you are attracted
wth that mare
What that bull has not done in
years I`ll do in five minutes.
Tonight after lights go off...
- What`s he saying?
Let me ride my darling
it is matter of prestige.
What`s he whispering in
horse`s ear.
So, is it yes - oh great.
Well done Suraj. Even I was
unable to control this horse.
Love has tremendous power.
- You`re right.
Okay, you can keep this horse.
- Thank you sir.
/I`m covered in the
/Veil of your love
/I`m lost in your love
/I`ve forgotten myself in love
/My darling
/Whatever others may think
/We`ll be bound by our love
/Never be afraid in love.
/You`re covered in the
/Veil of my love
/My heart was lonely
/My heart was forlorn
/I was restless
/Heart was devoid of happiness
/After meeting with you
/I`ve no such complaint
/I`m sure I`ll enter only
/Your home after marriage
/They`ve some magic
/That make me impatient
/Whenever I pray to God
/I only ask for you
/Put symbol of love on my head

/Begin the suspicious ceremony
I`m happy to meet you Vijay Singh.
You helped Vishal.
Yes Thakur sahib. After I`ve
settled a land dispute.
I know many people in this area
I`ll be very happy to help you.
Thank you very much Thakur sahib.
Okay Vishal, bye. Namaste.
Be happy.
- Uncle, I`ll see him off.
Will he be suitable for Muscan?
Really? This is on your mind.
- Yes uncle.
What do you think?
- I like the boy.
Okay, let`s talk to his parents.
Surprised. You liked some boy.
I`ve done everything possible
to win Vishal confidence.
And finally he has approved
someone else for you.
Are you hurt my son?
Daddy!
If you agree to collaborate
with our company...
It`s a very profitable
deal Mr. Malhotra.
Hello, who`s speaking?
- Let me talk to dad...
Hello daddy, I`m Suraj here.
How are you dad?
I`m okay, how about you?
- I need your help dad.
Have you run out of money?
How much should I send?
I don`t need money...
I need you.
What`s the matter Suraj?
Are you all right?
Your dad is in a very important
meeting, call him later on.
What happened?
Disconnected. Take it inside.
What are you doing sir?
You`re destroying the booth.
Being her elder brother
I thought I can decide for her.
She`ll be happy with all my
decision. But it`s not so.
I don`t understand.
- I`ll be very frank Vijay.
I need some more time to
consider baby`s marriage.
I think it is decision
for Muscan`s life.
I`ve no problem with time. She
should be happy with your decision.
Thank you Vijay.
I was hoping for this answer.
It`s our wonderful plan.
You got all - wealth, land and woman.
Why are you so scared?
- Pull up your pants.
Vijay I`m surprised on my blunder
to recognize a man like you.
Now you know what we can do
to reach our goal.
You`ve already crossed the limit
by thinking about Muscan.
This is only the beginning.
- I`m ready to end it.
What have you done my son,
you`ve started the war.
You don`t know them brother
they beat more than they count.
Perhaps I don`t know them,
but I know their one weakness.
There is no fun without Suraj!
Isn`t he Suraj`s daddy?
I had trust in you. By hiding
your affair you`ve shocked me.
Forgive me uncle for making
you so unhappy.
But tell me - what else
could I`ve done?
Please forgive me for
my mistake.
Where do you come from?
I`m Akash Khanna, Suraj`s father.
- They`re my mom and dad sir.
We searched for you everywhere.
Your friends told everything.
I`d left home long ago, how come
you remember me today.
Why we remember you? You have
always been in our heart.
We`ve arranged your marriage in
one of India`s richest family.
Must be a business deal
- Come to sense Suraj.
Surprising my unconsciousness
broke by coming here.
We`ll be broken if we can`t...
It`s impossible to marry you in
this lower status family.
Mrs. Khanna.
- Don`t forget she`s your mother.
No dad, she is mother by
way of relation with you.
And people she is talking about
are more respected than her.
Can I see that respected girl
who has created this problem.
I`ve restrained him but if you
utter one disrespect word
about Muscan then nobody
will be able to stop me.
Stop Muscan.
We`ve come to take our son who
is entrapped by your daughter.
Don`t misinterpret our patience
as our weakness.
For your own good.
go away from here.
Uncle Vijay Singh has
kidnapped Muscan.
No Suraj, you won`t go anywhere.
- Papa I love Muscan very much.
And I love you very much and
don`t want to lose you.
Then become my old papa again.
- What are you doing.
This is not our quarrel
let him alone if he must.
You`ve always complained I leave
everything uncompleted...
today I`ll finish my job.
Uncle, brother.
- Go and attack them.
Isn`t she everybody`s life?
isn`t she everybody`s weakness?
Now what are you thinking?
You don`t worry I`ll assemble
panchayat.
Sure, but in jail.
