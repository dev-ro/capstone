This is the first
and only time in history
that any steel structure
skyscrapers,
have ever collapsed
due to the fire.
It has never before
been recorded
in the history
of structural engineering
before or since.
So, the government is asking us
to believe that on this one day
nine eleven, as it were
the laws of physics
were suspended
and phenomenon never before
known to structural
engineering, were taking place
just in this
exact location.
It turns out
that steel has...
-Hey, Hun.
-Hey, you.
You washing dishes?
My sweetie.
I know, I am your sweetie.
Babe, why do
you use hot water?
What do you mean?
I'm washing the dishes.
What do you mean?
I'm washing the dishes.
Excuse me
for questioning
your doubts in my
dish-washing capabilities, but
what do you mean?
You don't need to use hot water.
- Sure I do.
- No, you don't.
Babe, yes, I do.
Hot water kills the germs.
That's not true.
-Yes, it does.
-No, it's a myth, look it up.
OK, I'll look it up.
I will Google it.
Fine, Google it.
Babe, what are you
suggesting I use, warm water?
Well, no, you can do cold water.
But, yeah
-warm water's fine too.
-Cold water, that's crazy.
What do you think
cowboys and Indians
-did back in the day?
-I think they died.
They all died young.
From the germs they got by
improperly washing their dishes.
I really don't believe you.
I will look it up.
OK, fine, look it up.
Sorry,
it just doesn't make any sense.
Shit.
-What?
-God damn it.
What?
Nothing, I just forgot
to do something at work.
-What?
-What do you mean what?
-You don't care.
-Hey.
I care, I'm asking what.
- What did you forget?
- OK, sorry.
I care.
What happened?
It's stupid.
You know...
You don't communicate,
it's like I,
I'm asking you what happened.
And you're saying
it doesn't matter.
It's like you can't walk in here
and say, "Shit,"
and have it not matter.
Like I said, it's just...
-it's stupid.
-Well, let me decide
on whether it's
important or not.
Alright, we're out of coffee.
At work?
Yeah.
And, why is it so funny?
-You know Peggy?
-Yeah.
I don't know why for some reason
when she gets anxious
she staples for some reason.
And she gets anxious
when she also
doesn't get her coffee.
Yeah, well, I don't think
coffee is a proper solution
for somebody who gets anxious.
-Well, yeah.
-Wait, you need this, right?
Yeah.
But, anyways
she was just stapling everything
and she stapled this
patient's chart.
And then Dr. Demi
went to open it,
and couldn't, 'cause
all down the side
were all these staples
that she'd put.
And he knew it was her
and he was, like "Peggy"
"Why in the world would
you staple a chart
multiple times?"
And she was just standing there
and then, of course
he goes to get coffee,
and sees that there's none,
and knows why it happened
in the first place.
And so he said, "Paige,
whatever you do,
before you leave,
get coffee," of course.
And the coffee guy's
name is Joe?
-Yeah.
-That's weird.
Why?
Cup of Joe?
Yeah.
That sounds made up.
Alright.
How many of these things
do you think I should make?
You know,
like these cracker things?
I don't know,
how many people are coming?
-I don't know.
-Well, how many people
did you invite?
25, 30, but 30 people
are not gonna show up.
30 people?
Paige, we cannot fit
30 people in here.
Babe, did you just hear me?
30 people never show up.
Probably five will come.
-How many did you invite?
-I invited six.
So, I invited six,
the only six people I know here.
OK.
Let me guess.
Jerry, Samantha, Joel, Ethan.
Carrie.
-Carrie, really?
-Yeah.
-Instead of who?
-Joel's not comin'.
- Why?
- He can't make it.
- I like him.
- He can't make it.
OK, so then,
you invited eight people.
No, I didn't invite Joel,
because his sister's
coming into town.
And so, we're outta luck.
Well, why didn't
you just invite her too?
I did, she said no.
Actually she's really odd.
She doesn't like to go out.
OK, well, then that means you
invited eight people, not six
No, I didn't.
I wasn't actually
expecting her to say yes,
- so I didn't count her.
- So she was a pity invite?
So then,
who are the other two?
It was Jerry, Ethan,
Chris, Samantha,
Joel, Grace, and Lynn.
What did they say?
- They said they were busy.
- Yeah.
-They were busy.
-OK.
OK, they weren't busy, but
as soon as I extended an invite
they got very busy
trying to make better plans
-to spend their Friday night.
-Sure.
We're hoping that it
worked out for them, right?
We are?
No.
I hope they're doing nothing.
Put these on wrong.
Why do you care so much?
I don't
care, I was just...
it doesn't matter.
How many of these things
do you think I should make?
-I didn't think you liked them.
-I don't.
OK, so why are you getting
so upset about Grace and...
I'm not upset,
I just wanna finish these.
How many do you think
I should make of these?
OK, well, you're
expecting five people.
Although, you invited 30.
I'm expecting five so let's say
what, about 12?
So, what, three each person?
Three?
Babe, like four, five, or six.
-These are little.
-Five.
OK, with everything
else we're gonna make,
-four should be fine.
-OK four, so that's what
four times twelve
48, that's a lot.
Well, it wouldn't be
if you started helping.
I am helping,
I'm helping.
I don't even know what to do.
You're the food expert here.
Babe, just take
the rolls there,
and just start slicing them thin
you know what I'm making.
Slicing.
Thin, just like
really, you know, like
-How thin?
-Just little.
Like that.
Is that thin enough?
That's thin.
-Yeah, that's good.
-That's too thin.
-No, it's not.
-No, that's as thin as I go.
Well, lucky for me.
What does what mean?
It doesn't mean anything, I was
My God.
I wanna do something amazing.
I have this feeling that...
I'm meant to do
something really important.
Something...
big, something special.
I don't know, something...
Something really amazing.
Babe.
If it's meant to be,
it'll happen.
Like
I have this really positive...
It's almost a vibe, it's...
I don't know, I
don't know how to
access it, or
what to do with it
or even what it is.
But...
I don't know.
People have to do things.
Things just don't happen
because they're meant to be.
I don't know
like we have the power.
The power's in our hands.
What do you mean by power?
What kind of power?
I don't know, the power to
-To do what?
-To do something important.
Something amazing.
I mean, if you think about it.
I mean, the only
reason we're here
is because people before us
acted on their feelings.
And they did things.
Doctors, and scientists,
and engineers, they...
They were inspired.
And they actually did something.
That's it, I mean, that's it.
That's the key.
I mean, you have to...
You have to be inspired.
Where are you going?
I just, I just want some paper.
If you think about it
I mean, everything great
that's ever happened
starts with someone
being inspired, and,
and, you know
I'm not talking about
it doesn't have to be
this huge thing, it can really
it can be small.
It could
I mean, a smile.
I mean think about
how small is a smile?
And that can completely
change someone's mood.
And then that person,
you know, feels inspired
to pass it on, and
then, you know,
perform a new act of kindness
And so on, and so,
I mean, it does happen.
It really, all the time, but...
But then the problem is,
it doesn't happen all the time.
Because there's those people
that, you know,
see the act of kindness,
and keep it for themselves.
Or they don't see it.
You know, they're just,
they're not open to it, and
And those are people that don't
take action, and I don't
wanna be that person.
I'm not gonna be that person.
-I don't.
-Yeah, you do, Hun.
-No, I work wanna do more.
-You do plenty.
I'm gonna do more.
I just,
I think if I get it all down
and I can see it,
then I'll know it's
a possibility, and...
And then I can decide
what I wanna do.
I don't know.
You look so tired.
I'm sorry, I'm keeping you up.
I can just do this
in the kitchen.
No, that's OK.
I'll get it.
I gotta get up anyway,
I forgot to brush my teeth.
Alright, OK.
I'll just be in the kitchen.
Well,
despite the wet weather here
it's nothing like the weather
people are experiencing
in the mid-west
and the east.
But in a rare occurrence,
the bad weather to the east
is affecting us
here in California,
as we are being asked
to cut back on electricity.
Ground force Dan Kerman joins
us here in the studio tonight
to explain
his winter Flex Alert, Dan...
You are so cute.
- Are you watchin' the news?
- Kind of.
Catchin' up on the world?
You can change it, Hun.
Who's this for?
Did you know we
had a new neighbor?
-Next door?
-Yeah.
You saw someone?
I didn't get a good look,
but yeah, I mean,
somebody's there.
This morning?
Yeah, he was
he was outside
looking up at the sky.
You didn't see him?
No, maybe he's a squatter.
Out in the open?
What are these lights?
It's a reflection
in the mirror
that the subject
is looking through.
A mirror?
Yeah.
That's me looking at a mirror.
So this is all a reflection?
Yep.
What's it mean?
- Paige.
- What?
I don't know, it's...
it's art, I mean...
I can't tell you what it means.
What's it mean to you?
I mean, come on, it's gotta
mean something to you.
You painted it for a reason.
I'm just trying
to get inside your head.
I don't want you to
get inside my head.
I want you to
consider what's inside yours.
OK, so you're gonna tell me
this isn't about you?
No.
It's...
bout the person looking at it.
You're in it.
It's a painting of you
looking in a mirror at yourself.
But it isn't about you?
Babe, why are you
getting so upset about this?
I'm not upset,
I'm just confused.
Well, I think
you're over-thinking it.
Whatever.
No, not whatever, Paige.
Yeah, I mean, it's art.
You can't over-analyze it,
you have to experience it.
Whatever.
Babe, I'm sorry
if my answer upset you,
or frustrated you,
or confused you, I just
Why Denise?
I don't know.
Is she gonna
know what it means?
What does,
what does that mean?
Hey, it's a simple question.
I'm just asking.
I don't think you're
asking something, Paige, I think
You might be implying something.
What am I implying?
I don't know,
something pretty insane.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, how do I know, if you
won't tell me what it means?
Don't you have
something to do this morning?
OK, I'm not implying anything,
I'm just curious.
Why Denise?
I'm not gonna go
back and forth with you on this.
It's strange, that's all.
For a married man to give
widow a painting of himself.
Well, that widow was
married to my best friend.
Do you think I'd actually
screw my best friend's wife?
Paige, after he shot himself?
-OK, don't...
-In the fucking head?
Don't yell at me.
I'm just asking for some answers
Do you think I would actually
do that to him or to you?
OK, I'm just,
I'm confused, OK?
I'm sorry that it upset you.
No, you're not sorry.
You're actually thrilled to
get a reaction like this, right?
Because it shows you that.
It shows you that I care.
You just can't
take my word for it.
'Cause if you did, you'd
save us both a lot of trouble.
Please, calm down, you want
the whole fucking neighborhood
to know we're fighting?
You wanna calm down, just go.
Leave.
Fine, I'm leaving.
I'll leave you to
your paintings.
Next time, give me a heads up
when you want to throw
one of your jealous rants again.
I didn't throw a
jealous rant in your face.
I asked you a question.
A question that you
didn't have an answer to.
Now, does that make me
question your loyalty?
Yeah, and am I sorry
for your reaction?
Yeah, but am I still jealous
that you
give other women paintings,
and not your own wife?
Yeah, sorry.
I can't help it.
Hey.
Hey.
So, what you're saying
that you're jealous
that I give my paintings
to other people?
-Yeah, that's what I said.
-OK.
I can see why that would
upset you and I'm sorry.
But Paige, I wish, next time,
you would just tell me that.
What do you want me to
do, beg you for a painting?
I know you don't
paint on command.
You don't even
like my paintings.
I like that you paint.
So...
I don't just give my paintings
to other women, you know.
-I know.
-I gave one to Joel
-the last time, remember?
-I know.
I don't know what this
painting means to me, Paige.
I don't wanna know.
I thought I'd give
it to Denise so
she can challenge herself,
in some ways,
to take a look at herself.
But it's a painting of you.
I know, I'm just...
I'm saying we're a lot alike
in some ways.
Yeah.
And Paul.
-You both had Paul.
-Yeah.
Hey, hun,
did you get my text?
No, I'm sorry.
Well, I was just asking
if you were OK with leftovers.
I'm sorry, I just
I just did not have it in me
-to make anything.
-It's OK.
My God, I'm so tired.
I know, I talked about
lasagna all week.
But, you know, I'm just gonna
have this chicken salad.
-You want anything?
-No, I'm not hungry.
-Did you already eat?
-Nope.
You know what tonight is.
Micheal J. Fox Show,
new episode.
New episode?
Someone at work was saying
Lea Thompson was gonna
guest star, but
I bet it's just
an internet thing.
Like Eddie Murphy is
supposed to host the Oscars.
That never happened.
You know what he should do?
I don't know why he hasn't
done it, he should host SNL.
Has he?
Has he done that before?
I don't think so.
He should do that,
he's so funny.
My God.
Where are you?
What is that for?
I think he was in Tower Heist.
Babe, that
was so long ago.
-I'm talking about this year.
-I don't know.
Probably some kiddie movies.
You know what,
everyone says that.
Everyone picks on him
for doing kids' films.
So he's found a new audience,
good for him.
He's certainly so funny,
and he's,
I'm sure he's making
a lot of money
and supporting his family.
Good for him.
Babe, can I show
you something?
-Well, is it gonna take long?
-No.
You know, I wanna take my bath.
OK, but it's not
gonna take long.
It's just about five minutes.
-OK, well, is it on that thing?
-Yeah.
Well, do you have to set
it all up and do all that
-No.
-OK, well, what is it?
I can't explain it, it's...
OK, then what's the point?
The point is,
I want you to watch it.
OK, Hun, what is it?
I can't explain it, Paige, I'd
like for you to see it yourself.
Alright.
I'll take my bath
and then I'll watch it.
Fine.
Are you mad?
I'm disappointed.
You're disappointed because
I won't watch the
video right now?
What can be so important
that it can't wait?
Why, does it have
to be important to you
in order for you to be
interested in watching it?
What, it can't be
important to me,
in order for my wife to take
interest in something
I wanna show her?
Hun, that's really selfish.
-What?
-That's selfish behavior.
-That's not fair to me.
-How is that selfish?
Babe, I wanna watch the video
if you're interested in it,
but I don't feel like,
I feel like you're
demanding right now.
-No, I did not say it like that
-Watch this video.
I did not use that tone,
I did not demand it.
I know you didn't, OK,
but the reason that you're
acting like this is because I
won't watch it right now.
I just wanna take a bath,
and then I'll watch the video.
-Ok, fine, yeah whatever.
-Is that alright, great.
Take your bath.
Maybe you'll care
about my feelings
after your bath.
My God.
You know what, fine, let's do it
-What is it?
-No, now you're just
trying to be spiteful.
Now you're just
taking the higher ground
so you can avoid
-the bigger subject.
-If it's so important to you
-let's watch it now.
-We'll watch later I don't want
-I want to see it now.
-I don't want, Paige
-leave the thing along, Paige.
-Just let me see it.
-break the God dammed camera.
-I just wanna see it.
So, you don't want me to see it?
No, I don't want
you to watch it.
It's not important.
Alright, fine.
I'm gonna go take my bath.
Hey there.
Evening.
It's a nice night.
Are you the neighbor
that spies on me?
No.
Actually we
didn't even know anyone
lived here until recently.
-We?
-Yes, my wife and I.
Married.
We bought the
house in the fall.
You bought this house
in the fall and you're only
coming around now
to introduce yourself?
Yes.
Like I said, we didn't even
know anyone lived here.
Do you know what
astral projecting is?
Excuse me?
Astral projecting.
It's glorious.
It happens when you're
asleep at night.
Your soul goes hurdling
outside of your body.
Goes flying up like the birds.
It goes with the birds.
It goes through clouds.
And then it's above everything.
It goes so fast,
it's so beautiful.
You're beyond physicality.
Your soul can't grasp it.
And then it does, because it
lets go of what the mind says.
You've never experienced
anything like this?
I think my wife is calling me.
I should get going.
Why did you come out here?
I just...
I just wanted to say hi.
Do you want something?
No.
Do you want some information?
Actually, did you see anything
unusual in the last
couple of days?
It would be very unusual
if I saw anything at all.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
We're just two men
having a conversation
in the dark.
One man can see.
One man can think.
Which one of the men is
going to see the light?
Will it be you?
I don't...
My name is Griffin.
Can I come knock on your
door someday and say hello?
Sure.
Nice to meet you.
-What are you doing?
-Hey.
Where'd you go?
-I met our neighbor.
-You did?
What are you doing down there?
I thought you were
taking a bath?
I am, I just came
to get a little wine.
Isn't your show on in an hour?
I'll make it.
Do you wanna watch it with me?
What are you looking at?
The sky.
Is something wrong?
Why do you ask that?
You seem different.
You noticed?
What is it?
I saw something.
-What?
-In the sky.
What?
It was an alien spacecraft.
OK, what did it look like?
It was a bunch of lights.
Blue, red, and amber.
Moving.
Like my paintings.
-The one for Denise?
-Yeah.
So, you saw lights?
Moving.
-Flickering?
-Flickering and moving.
Information.
So, what do you think it was?
A spacecraft.
I got it on video.
Do you wanna see it?
What do you think it means?
I'm gonna take a bath.
Come in.
-I gotta pee.
-OK.
I wanna tell you something,
but I don't want you to get mad.
OK, you won't get mad?
OK, if I get mad, I won't
show you that I'm mad.
OK.
Should I sit down for this?
You can.
Not everything's about you.
What?
Not everything is about you.
OK.
Where is this
where is this coming from?
Four years of being married.
Two years of being engaged.
One year of working with you.
OK, so what do you mean
not everything's about me?
-What is that?
-I just...
I don't want you to get mad.
I just wanna
bring up an issue
that's been bothering me.
OK, what?
You.
-Me?
-Yeah.
-Babe, you just...
-I'm the issue?
Yeah.
I'm the whole issue?
Yeah, you...
-You make things about you,
-OK, how?
When they're not.
How?
Give me an example.
Kim.
-Needed a sitter last week.
-Yeah?
And we both agreed
that we couldn't do it.
No, no, you
decided we couldn't go.
Yeah, we had a date.
We had plans to go bowling.
Yeah, we could have
taken Jake with us.
Now, why would we do that?
I mean we have the opportunity.
We're never alone, Paige.
So, we had the opportunity
to have a date,
to go bowling.
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with that.
That's not being selfish.
But it's not always about us.
OK.
I...
I disagree.
I find that ridiculous
and invalid.
What about your signature?
-My signature?
-Yeah, it's
What about it?
It's a complete mockery
of any written language.
-It's illegible.
-OK.
OK, but Babe
Why are you attacking me?
-I told you not to get angry.
-I'm not angry.
I'm confused, OK.
You're attacking my signature.
You're calling me self-centered.
I'm not that
self-centered, Paige.
Nate, you paint
paintings of yourself.
Need I say more?
What, so you're not
gonna listen to me now?
Nate, don't walk...
Great, you're gonna walk away?
I do understand
the Denise painting, you know.
But you paint yourself
into every single painting.
It's because you see yourself
in the center
- of every situation.
- OK.
Who doesn't, Paige?
Who doesn't see
themselves at the center?
Whose perspective am I
supposed to experience?
What, yours?
Whose vision am I
supposed to have?
Yours?
Am I supposed to live life
the way Paige sees it?
No, you know what,
I do, I have
I'm fucking selfish.
I have my own
opinions about shit.
And, that's because I
do have my own
opinions about shit.
And my own thoughts,
and my own feelings.
It's like, who else's experience
am I supposed to have?
You're God Damn right, Paige.
You know what, you are
absolutely God damn right.
I am self-centered.
I am self-centered because
I care about what happens to me.
About what happens to my family
to my friends.
And to the people around me.
Yes, you are right.
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!
I am self-centered.
What happens when Indian food
wins over Mexican, Paige?
Is it self-centered
of you to choose
one over the other?
Based on what you want?
-What are you talking about?
-Naw, is it,
is it self-centered of me
to allow you to decide
what we eat based on
what your cravings are?
- We decide together.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I let you decide,
because it matters more to you.
-So I step out of the way.
-OK, can we...
You want to call that
self-centered, is it
-self-centered, Paige?
-We don't have to
-argue about this.
-We don't have to argue
-about this, no OK, you're right
-Great, good.
We don't have to
argue about this.
-I want to discuss it.
-OK.
-I don't want to discuss it.
-I would.
No, you know,
no, you know what?
I am self-centered,
but so are you.
So are you, Paige.
I told you, I...
I just want to take a bath, OK?
Please.
Why'd you bring it up?
-Me being self-centered.
-Nate.
I'm not asking
in a defensive way.
I'm just wondering
why you brought it up.
But I don't want to discuss it.
This is a completely
new discussion.
It's not about me
being self-centered.
I'm just asking why
you brought it up.
You brought it up.
I don't know.
I mean, what do you...
Were you bringing it up
because you care?
I don't know.
I mean, you asked me
not to get
angry, and I got angry.
But you,
you still shared
your feelings, and...
I reacted emotionally.
I'm sorry I didn't
realize your intentions.
I don't know what
my intentions were.
But I wasn't trying
to hurt your feelings.
I will let you take a bath.
Can I get you a book...
-or something?
-No, I'm fine.
-Some wine?
-No.
Reruns.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
- You wanna watch it with me?
- No, I...
I think I'll go watch the news.
Maybe paint a little bit.
You know where to find me.
We saw
sporadic outages today.
And tonight, some people are
still sweltering in the dark.
KCAL's Elsa Ramona's
live tonight in Long Beach,
where some residents
are steamed.
-Elsa?
-Yeah, it was really frustrating
for some of these residents,
here is this Long Beach
neighborhood, to see
their neighbors with power.
And them go without. But
Southern California Edison
has been out here working
for the past several hours
to make sure they don't
have to spend a night
uncomfortable without
air conditioning.
Monica O'Brien eagerly watches
Southern California Edison
crews repair
the blown transformer
just behind her house.
She's been without power
since about 1:45.
And she's opened every window
and door in her home,
but it's offered
little relief.
Hopefully, you know,
everything will be OK
Hey, mom, it's Nate.
I'm just callin' to catch up.
You're probably on
that graveyard shift.
But...
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.
Hey, Nate.
I need some cigarettes,
I need a ride.
I would drive myself, but
I've been drinking too much
You seem like a nice guy,
do you work at it?
What, being nice?
You seem nice, but we both
know that you're not that nice.
I'm nice.
I'm giving you a ride, aren't I?
Yeah.
Thank you very much, by the way.
You're welcome.
Very worthy cause, to get me
booze and cigarettes.
So you're gonna stick to your
nice-guy routine, aren't you?
What do you mean?
You're gonna stick to
your nice-guy routine.
I don't understand.
No, you don't understand.
Why don't you explain it to me.
If I did,
then it wouldn't be a surprise.
Can I ask you something?
Were you...
Were you looking up
at the sky earlier?
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, I meant observing.
Did you observe anything
in the sky earlier?
-Did you...
-Do you love your wife?
Do you respect her?
Do I love my wife?
Yes.
No, you don't.
I do.
You don't love your wife.
It's clear.
What?
Are you lying to yourself?
Or are you lying to me?
Because I can forgive you.
But I don't think that
you can forgive yourself.
What are you talking about?
I do love my wife.
But you don't respect her.
How do you know I don't?
How would you know I don't?
Because you told me.
-No I didn't.
-Yeah, you did.
You told me that
you don't love her.
You told me you
don't respect her.
What?
Do I, I do respect...
You know, this is exactly
what I'm trying to tell you.
You don't listen.
-Excuse me, I don't think...
-Shut up.
Just shut up.
What?
You're a lost cause.
Thank you for getting me
cigarettes, I appreciate it.
I shouldn't smoke.
Babe?
What are you doing?
Watching the news.
It's really late.
So what?
So, when are you
coming to bed?
When I'm ready to.
You can watch
the news in there.
Well, I'm not
really watching it.
OK, then why
don't you come to bed?
Just not ready to.
Are you mad at me?
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Is there something going on
that I should know about?
You're unbelievable.
What?
I don't wanna
deal with this right now.
Deal with what?
I don't wanna
deal with this tonight.
Is there something
you should know about?
Yes.
Are you interested in it?
No.
So what's the point
of a conversation?
Why are you
acting like this?
I'm gonna sleep
down here tonight.
Why?
Why?
I'll tell you why.
I saw something in the sky,
and you don't believe me.
I didn't say that.
I saw a spacecraft,
and you don't believe me.
I didn't say that.
Without words, you did.
Without words?
Come on, Nate.
You care more about
your Michael J. Fox Show
than watching the video
that proves what I saw, Paige.
It slipped my mind.
You know how much
I love that show.
It was a rerun, Paige.
I still like the show.
I'm sorry if I was preoccupied.
Point is,
you don't believe me.
No, I believe,
I think you saw something.
I don't think you can
explain what it was.
I saw a spacecraft.
And I needed you to believe me.
I don't believe you, Nate.
I need evidence.
Sorry if I rule in favor of
the scientific method,
I'm gonna sleep here tonight.
You do whatever you want.
Why are you acting like this?
Because I'm disappointed.
In the way you've been acting.
Babe, I don't wanna fight.
I had a long day.
I wanted to come home
and take a bath,
and watch my show.
I didn't mean to brush you off
but...
-I wanna understand what...
-Why?
Why do you wanna understand now,
and you didn't before?
-Do you care about what I saw?
-Yes.
I don't believe that you care.
You know, why do I have to care?
Is it my job
as your wife to care
about every little
interest you have?
Yes.
You don't care
about all my interests.
Yes, I do.
You don't watch
my shows with me.
No, but I care
that you're interested
in watching them.
-Are you really?
-Yeah.
-No.
-You're a hypocrite.
Don't throw the camera.
I didn't throw it, I tossed it.
Don't toss the camera.
You are a hypocrite.
And you are insensitive.
You're also irrational.
-How am I irrational?
-You're irrational.
-How?
-You just do irrational things.
An example would be helpful.
Well, there's many
I can think of
and when I feel like
coming up with an example,
-I'll let you know.
-And, I'm insensitive?
How am I insensitive?
How am I irrational?
No, don't answer a question
with a question.
You're avoiding what I asked.
How am I insensitive?
I saw something tonight, Paige,
and it scared me.
I don't know what it means.
I...
didn't know what to do
with that feeling.
So I was hoping to share
that feeling with my wife.
But she doesn't care.
She's not interested.
What if it's all in your head?
See?
There's the insensitive part.
I'm just asking a question.
Doesn't matter
if it's in my head, Paige.
It's not the point.
Goodnight.
Unbelievable.
A meteor,
I actually, I witnessed
not this one, but years ago,
where they do change
colors through the sky.
And they're a little slower
than an actual
shooting star.
So, it sounds like that's
what we're dealing with here.
Well, whatever
we're dealing with,
it's certainly got everyone's
attention, and our news room's
been flooded with emails
from witnesses
who saw that object
streaking across the night sky.
People
describing it as a bright light.
Some say it looked
like a falling star.
Others say it looked
like a red comet with
Thanks to everyone who wrote us
on a night like this
we appreciate you very much.
Are you serious?
You're texting me this
from the other room, Paige?
Are you kidding me, nine eleven?
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not kidding you.
You should know better, Paige.
Were you...
just tryin' to pick a fight
with me now?
Once again, I don't know
what you're talking about.
The last time I blew something
out of proportion.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
So you're texting me this
in the middle of the night.
-Cause you wanna pick a fight.
-No.
I'm adding a point
to earlier's argument.
So you're comparing
tonight's incident
with my nine eleven theory?
And your Jesus sighting,
and your Jane Austen book.
I never said I saw
Jesus in the driveway.
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't, I said it could
-have been him.
-What's the difference?
The difference is,
you don't listen to me.
I don't listen to you, Nate?
I don't listen to you
when you tell me that
Jesus is walking his bike
past our driveway?
And I don't listen to you
when you tell me that
you found an autographed book
from an author
that died before
the book was published?
And I don't listen to you
when you tell me that
the twin towers came down
from explosions
inside the building?
I wonder why
I don't listen to you, Nate?
You know what?
What?
Do you see a pattern?
Yeah, I see a pattern
of you not giving a shit.
-You know what?
-You're so simple minded.
You're so narrow-minded,
you really are.
It's like you can't see outside
of your television reruns,
and your magazines.
Live a little, Paige.
Go out and see the fucking world
open up your eyes.
Don't believe everything
that's spoon fed to you.
Your nine eleven theory,
it's bullshit.
It makes absolutely
no sense at all.
No, see,
if you followed politics,
and you understand
how people in power work,
it makes sense.
You understand
how people in power work.
So, you understand how
the United States government
killed 3,000
of its American citizens?
A faction,
a faction of the government did.
And that's why
it's called a conspiracy, Paige.
It's bullshit.
You know what, you're just
interested in
the spectacle of it all.
No, I'm interested
in the evidence.
I'm interested in the factsn
and there is enough evidence
OK, but it's only you that can't
open your eyes up to it.
OK, explain the
Jane Austen book.
-I messed up.
-You spend $250 dollars
-on a counterfeit artifact.
-I said I fucked up.
You don't even like Jane Austen.
That's way besides the point.
OK, I fucked up, but at least
I take chances, Paige.
What do you do, watch reruns,
and smell your magazines.
-Don't be mean.
-Don't be inconsiderate.
You know what,
I don't care, OK?
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Yeah, which makes me ridiculous.
Right?
Your Jesus sightings.
Fuckin' UFO's
I mean, why does everything have
to be a possibility with you?
I saw a spacecraft, Paige.
I saw it with my own eyes,
and I have it on video.
But you don't wanna watch it.
I saw it last week
and I saw it tonight.
I don't know if Jesus
walked in our driveway.
I don't know if the Bush clan
killed thousand of Americans OK?
But I know what I saw,
and I saw a spacecraft.
And I don't know
what to make out of it.
OK, can you just stop
talking for once?
Why is everything about you?
Why does the world
revolve around you?
You're so self-centered.
-Why is everything about you?
-No.
-This is about us.
-No.
-This is about the whole world.
-No, no it's not, Nate.
It's about you.
Because,
you saw some fucking UFO,
and now you need to tell
the whole world about it.
You discovered the
nine eleven conspiracy.
So, that's all
you're gonna talk about
-for like three fucking months.
-I didn't discover it.
And then you find some old book
with a fake autograph in it
So you invested a fourth
of our car insurance into it.
I said I fucked up.
I mean, it's all about you.
I don't understand.
What, what is your life not as
exciting as you'd like it to be?
Were you picked on as a kid,
and you have no confidence,
and so the only way you
can find happiness now,
is escaping
into these fantasies?
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.
You're calling my life
a fucking fantasy.
No, no,
you're not listening to me.
I am saying that you need
to escape into these fantasies.
What else would you call them?
Fake autographs,
and UFO's,
and God knows what else.
You're life's a fucking
piece of fiction, Nate.
You don't know what
you're talking about, Paige.
You said I live in a big piece
of fucking fiction
Which is living in a fantasy,
which is what you said.
-You didn't say.
-OK, I didn't mean it before,
-but I mean it now.
-The point is you don't get me.
What the fuck is the deal
about your point?
Who fucking cares?
That's a stupid expression.
No, the look on your face
is a stupid expression.
And you know what?
Before today, I
actually did care.
Very much.
What are my
three favorite books?
What?
I enjoy reading,
is this a mystery to you?
I don't think I'm gonna
take your quiz right now.
Right, 'cause you'd fail.
Because you don't bother
to read anything I recommend.
But you sure as hell
have plenty of time to
say that I don't consider
your obnoxious ramblings.
You don't see any
contradictions here?
No, I'm not disputing the fact
we have our difference, Paige
I don't wanna read
your fucking books.
And you don't wanna
hear my ramblings.
But it's not that
we're both hypocrites.
The problem is,
you're a bigger one.
-How?
-How?
Yeah.
You make absolutely no effort
to care about the things
that I'm interested in.
How far did you get
with "Wuthering Heights?"
Please.
Did you even finish
the first chapter?
That's not the same thing.
I don't trash
the books that you read.
I at least have respect for
certain things that you like.
So what?
So what?
You trashed my
nine eleven theory.
Why, because you
can't think for yourself.
How is that not trashing me?
OK, I am trashing you.
And it's probably
hurting my argument,
but it doesn't make
my point any less valid.
The thing is...
You don't care about my
interests, my thoughts,
my ideas.
And that hurts, Paige.
The point is, it's sad.
It's making me sad.
You are sad.
You constantly need this
artificial acknowledgment.
You know what, you
want some company?
Why don't you try
believing in something
that's based in reality?
Like owning a house,
instead of renting one?
Like trading in our
car for one that works?
There's a fantasy.
So I'm supposed
to have practical ideas,
that practical people have,
right?
I'm not supposed
to have any sort of
fantastical ideas
of exploration,
or wanting to think
outside the box.
I'm supposed to think
like everyday people.
Perhaps, something
closer to home,
like starting a family?
It's so crazy, you know what?
I used to have
thoughts like that.
Starting a family.
Maybe,
having a kid.
What's your point?
My point it, all of a sudden,
we can afford to have a house,
but we can't afford a kid.
They're two
completely different issues.
But you brought one up.
So, why not bring up the other?
I don't wanna have
your fucking kid.
I used to be on the fence about,
when I first met you,
I though I actually
wanted to have your kid.
But then, I don't know why.
I guess I realized
that, why would I
wanna have your kid,
when you're the fucking kid?
You think that's hurting me?
You think I actually give
a fuck about the kid thing?
I don't wanna have a kid with
you anymore either, Paige.
I haven't in a long time.
Of course you'd
think it's wonderful.
You think you're wonderful.
You're in
fucking love
with yourself.
Yeah, I am.
Why is that a bad thing?
I think everybody
should love themselves.
Don't fucking kid yoursel,
I know how bad you want a child.
I know how bad you would
love to chase UFO's,
and search for treasures
in hidden libraries.
You resent me
for not having your kid.
I know it.
And that's probably where
all the rest of this shit
is coming from.
You make me
feel so fucking alone.
You don't love her.
I told you.
Maybe you did once, maybe
before you got to know her.
But you don't now,
that's obvious.
Your actions reveal
your character.
And your language
reveals your soul.
You cannot love
without respect
And you have no
respect for things
outside of your own universe.
You're a lost, scared
angry man.
You're the reason
that love exists.
Faith, companionship, respect
are all facets of love
that are designed to
destroy fear and anger.
They're not treasures
you find in the sand.
They're things
that are already within you.
They're supposed
to be gifts, Nate.
From you to others.
The kind you share
unconditionally.
And without prejudice.
The kind you give away without
expecting a return.
But we all fall into this trap.
We're all so easily distracted.
We're distracted now.
Are you?
There's always something to
pull us away from ourselves.
And from each other.
Nate, what do you do when
you're faced with a challenge?
Do you demand answers?
Or do you ask questions?
Do you see differences as a
threat or as an opportunity?
Do you reach out?
Or do you run?
You were right.
Do you see it now?
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I love you.
