Sub Inspector Sethu.
Dad's little rascal.
What happened, sir?
Why do you laugh in your sleep, early morning?
Is it morning already?
- Don't you hear the church bells?
Are you seeing any unnecessary dreams at this old age?
Oh, stop it.
Chacko,
It is said that dreams at early morning will become reality, right?
So it's exactly as I thought.
Pray before You sleep, brother.
You are acting crazy early in the morning.
"It is impossible to imagine the size of an atom.
The size of the nucleus is even smaller."
"The mass of an atom is
almost fully.."
Mom! Dad is back.
"It is impossible to imagine the size of an atom,
the size of the nucleus is even smaller"
"The mass of an atom is almost fully concentrated on.."
Hey, are You really reading to learn, or simply to show off?
It's for both! I can learn as well as showoff to everyone else!
He will become a lawyer.
He has a reply for everything.
Dad, you are a typical policeman.
Everything I do is a fault for You.
If I read silently, you will ask whether I'm dreaming
and if I read loud, that's also an issue.
Read however you want.
But when your results come, it's better be 1st class.
Else I'll beat the skin off your leg.
Doesn't she have any work other than kitchen work?
She has exams next month.
What should I do?
If I ask her to read, she goes out with that pot and
launches into her chores.
So it's easy for mom now.
If there's work to be done in the kitchen, just tell sister to study,
Then mom can rest.
- Get lost.
Let's get a house next to a well with water in the summer,
else I'll suffer drawing water in a next few months.
Let's see.
I haven't found one cheap enough for my wallet.
The owner already told me about
increasing the rent of this house.
After Sethu's interview and personality test are over, we'll be fine..
Then you can demand the kind of house you want.
Oh God. May everything go well...
It will.
Today morning, I saw a dream.
I shall retire only after saluting him.
Brother sethu.
Hey, let me sleep.
- Dad is here.
So what should I do? Stand upside down?
That might help. Or else your going to get scolded.
For "not exercising, putting on weight, being careless.." etc
Tell him I started exercise early in the morning.
Do not speak when You perform Sheershasana.
Don't speak while doing
Sheershasana.. It's bad for You.
She was asking me to stop at least now.
I started at 5 am. What would she know about exercise, right?
True. But you don't have to do it for two hours.
Impossible. Already You're complaining that I'm overweight.
I won't accept failure, before reducing my weight.
Excuse me?
I need to reduce these flab, slim down...
For that you should at least do exercise for half hour daily.
And stop your hogging.
Who're you trying to fool?
Have you been exercising regularly after Your physical test?
Dad, I exercise daily, isn't it?
You're going to get a smacking from me. I overheard you earlier.
Along with interview there's a personality test.
To pass it, you need to be stout.
I know that. I'd slept late yesterday, preparing for the written test.
It's not easy, I need to read many books to get general knowledge.
Yes that's also important.
But You need some physical fitness too! - From tomorrow onwards,
even if the sky falls on my head, I won't stop exercising.
What about food?
won't go a single morsel beyond what you tell me, dad.
Rascal.
Go and study.
Ramesh.
- Here I come.
Are you joining for coffee? Dad and brother are waiting.
Let them wait...
Yike! what's on Your face? -It's called a mustache.
Stop it.
Who is your eldest son, dad?
- Why do You ask?
Maybe it's him.
Look here.
What have you drawn on your face?
- Mustache, what else?
I just darkened it a bit.
- Rub it off.
I said rub it out. - Hey rub it out.
Am I not allowed to even keep draw a mustache?
I've never used the cane on my kids, But You're pushing it.
He will surely get it from You.
2 idlis? Mom what're You thinking? No wonder I put on weight.
Well, You usually eat 10-15.
Well if You compel me to eat a lot like this.. - Shut up.
Mom, do You know what a personality test is?
Oh, not at all.
Ask here, you will know.
But I'm allowed 2 idlis, am I not, Dad?
Yes, you can have 2 in the morning.
A banana and a glass of milk also.
Add 2 eggs, 4 plantains.
Will You shut up?- There's no freedom to joke around here?
He'll surely get it from me this time.
- Eat.
Devi...
It's past 9.30 already. Are you coming?
- Coming.
If I take her along, I will never reach school before the 2nd bell.
Why are You so impatient, Krishna? Let her eat something first.
Krishna, come here.
Who's picture is this?
This is an ad for a tonic.
This is how a man should look.
Check out his biceps. Does this tonic make everyone like this?
Why, you want to try a bottle of it, Mom?
- Not me. Why not a bottle for our Sethu?
Talking about Sethu, are we?
Achu uncle already scolds him for being overweight.
Mom wants Sethu to turn into this. Do you plan to turn him into a wrestler?
He plans to become a cop, doesn't he?
He needs a fit body to beat those criminals up.
You've never seen Granddad, have you?
He was built like this dude right here.
Your dad is nowhere like him though.
All those genes went directly to Sethu.
Will You come with me, or listen to her stories?
Grandma, it's late. We'll continue when I'm back from school, ok?
Speak of the devil and here he comes.
- Grandma's made grand plans to get You fit.
Mocking me? -What do school teachers
know of Body building?
Now you're meeting us, eh?
- No uncle, I was mooting her actually.
Alright, as if cops knew better.
You only know how to teach alphabets to the kids.
Would get that teacher job without a 20k bribe?
Well, I passed the TTC too.
- As if the TTC was like the IAS. Buzz off.
Heard your well is dry.
Are You short of water?
Yeah, not even a single bucket of water.
Why do you people stay at a rented place,
when You can stay here?
This is your Mom's home.
I told your Dad a hundred times to stay here.
Achu has his self-respect.-This is more like self-disrespect. Let's go.
Granny, let's move into our plans.
You should build muscles like that dude in the newspaper.
Aunt, Your steam cake is always delicious.
Stop flattering me and finish Your breakfast.
Your granddad's menu in the morning:
2 steam cakes.Then 2 long bananas.
An egg, few glasses of milk. Men should eat like that.
Oh my. How did he digest all this?
Yea, that's what martial artists can do.
They can swallow stone and digest it like water.
They can take on 10 men, all alone.
Once, there was a fight at Kavushery festival.
Some 10-30 fellows, against granddad alone.
A few punches here and there,
the whole lot of them fell like a falling tree.
You've got his looks and traits, don't forget.
Even I can take on 2-3 guys.
I'm fit enough for that. Check out these biceps.
Hey, these are not enough.
You must learn martial arts.
Why don't you eat, Granny.
- No, You eat.
Please eat, granny, dad is coming.
So what?
- Here, shall I pour you more curry?
What're You doing, kid? You said you were hungry?
Stopped eating because you saw me?
Found it hard to reduce your diet, huh?
Granny has been compelling me even though I refused.
You asked me for food didn't you? What a liar.
Eat as You want. Don't starve Yourself down.
Forgive me, Dad.
From now on I'll control myself.
Did you take it seriously?
Rascal.
Don't give promises you can't make, you will get snubbed later on.
Is that your problem?
I thought it was something worse.
It's trivial, but worrying me.
Feel like I made a fool of my dad.
His laugh at the end makes us even weaker.
You're very sensitive.
Even Dad wasn't that serious about this.
If he scolded me, I wouldn't have minded.
What tricks are you two planning?
Sethu got another marriage proposal.
And he's strongly considering it. What say, teacher?
Then go ahead, Keshu. You'll end up having to marry her.
Why, do You think I won't?
Alright, I know You.
Last time when I got a proposal,
do You know how crazy he went, Keshu?
We bear them because we didn't want to disrespect them.
But he couldn't.
She would've tried to show herself off.
Girls use any opportunity to groom themselves.
Stop lying, I never went near them.
Please leave me out of this.
Fights are fun part of a relationship.
I won't interfere in your fight, have fun. See you 2 tomorrow.
Come, sit here.
No, I can't be seen in public like this. Let's go home.
As if we'd do anything at home.
I'd barely be able to see you well.
People with knives all around. Non-stop advice from your dad,
granddad-history from granny, and finally your Mom to finish it off.
Come if you want?
Alright. At least we can talk till we reach.
Sethu brother, people are waiting at library.
You forgot there's a meeting today?
- Carry on, I'll join later.
They asked you to come immediately. I'll drop her.
What a nuisance.
Today is full of spoilers like this.
Go fast.
- Get lost.
Sunaina: "Rama, You need not beg forgiveness."
That is the duty of wife's relatives."
Rama's eyes swell up in tears. -Why did Lord Rama's eye's swell up?
Because dust went into his eyes.
- Get lost!
Mom, aren't you listening?
- Yes.
Rama came to Janaka's house. He's pretty desperate, you see.
I know that.
I'm asking why Lord is crying when he sees Janaka's queen.
Because when he walked in, they took some digs at him.
Remember what I said?
The type that jealous aunts say.
I see. Poor fellow.
Yes, poor fellow. Rama's...
Mom, why did you stop massaging?
My hands are aching.
What comfort do you get out of this?
It's very comfy if you stroke my, hair,
You don't know.
And I heard it fights baldness.
Do you want me to grow bald like Krishna uncle?
You and your antics. Ok read on.
Rama's eyes swell
Raman: "Mom, if you speak so, who would console me?'
"I have come to lie in your loving laps."
"Bless me with your palms, I will get courage to face bitterness in life"
Mom, have you started crying?
Read on.
Janaka: "Sunaina, you see only your grievances, not Rama's. He's innocent..."
What is this, a drama?
- Ramayana, the screenplay.
Why don't you read it yourself and let him free. -When Sethu reads it, I can visualize it.
Dad, we need to buy a TV.
I don't have cash for that. When you earns, buy one for Mom.
I've promised Mom that. A TV in the kitchen.
She can watch in between all the cooking. -Shut up.
Look who's here.
You're going to command me one day. Salutes in advance.
Please don't taunt, sir.
Why do you think I'm taunting?
Won't you make it? By the way, why did you come?
Dad?
Dad and SI went to catch a criminal. Anything important?
Nothing. Today is salary day,
I need to give him a grocery list.
Get out, you. - Please spare me.
Please don't hit me, sir.
Get in.
Why are you standing baffled? Watch and learn.
Mom asked to Bring 2 chickens for dinner.
Settle acounts at the grocery.
You can keep this.
No need. Expenses will be higher this month due to the kid's exams and all.
You needn't worry. I am the patriarch,
I'll take care. Keep this.
Shall I also buy the stuff?
What stuff?
- I'll buy it myself.
Kids!
We were talking about whisky.
We usually drink on weekends.
- Does he drink?
Not for him, it's for me and bro-in-law.
Kids just have fish and chicken curry for dinner.
I was saying, it's not wise to refuse good jobs when the application call comes.
You mean it is foolish?
And I'm a fool?
Alright.
But he's my son. He'll get the job I plan for him.
I said what I had to.
Don't get high like last time and fall down somewhere
Alright, your dad even bought me toddy. Pour me some now.
Pour me some more...
- No, this is enough.
One more shot please...
- This is enough.
Give her some more...
Pour me some more, what're you afraid of?
Some more.
- That's enough.
Oh, the chicken is old.
Another thing.
Why should we postpone Sethu's and Devi's marriage?
Let's get them married.
Why not do it? Well, we can't.
Why are you going back on your word, Achu?
I never break my word.
But we'll get them married
only after Sethu get selected.
Why do you keep them waiting?
Devi has a job, that's enough for both of them to live.
Live on a wife's income? Not agreeable to my family.
Are you uncomfortable about him visiting here occasionally?
We've no reason to. - Why not?
You always lose control of your tongue when you are drunk.
He's my son. He won't act indecently.
Alright, I know your true nature. Shall I expose it?
Achu, Krishna, come here!
Stop there.
What happened?
- He was stealing.
What?
Well, one thing..
Is that all?
It's not that...
Well if you don't hand it over to him soon, he will grab it one day.
Haven't you slept yet, dad?
What're you reading?
General knowledge.
What are you thinking, Dad?
Nothing. I got a letter from Ambika.
Ramanan decided to quit his job.
How can he live without a job?
Don't know. She just came to know he resigned.
He says jobs are tough,
so he'll start a business.
- Does he have cash for it?
Who knows?
Since division of inheritance isn't done, he can stay at his brother's.
How long, though?
I married my daughter to him because his family's good.
Why did this happen to her, my god?
Dad don't worry, Ramanan might've other plans.
Yeah, right. Might've found a way to hog without working.
Tell sister to serve me more food. -Aren't you ashamed?
Why should I be? This is my house, I'm eating bread that my brother earned.
What brother earned is for his wife and children.
Do you feel so? I don't.
If you're hungry, better eat quickly.
If you wait for everyone to finish eating, you won't get anything.
I shall starve then. Else, take me back to my own house.
No matter how tough it is,
my Dad will take care of me.
Does your dad know how to live?
His colleagues earn a lot, but he barely has cash to loan me once in a while?
What'd he give me for marrying you?
10 sovereigns, that's all. Why'd I even marry you?
Well you've sold out all that as well.
You went to see your friend?
Yes, I'd to meet keshu. Give me lime juice with salt.
You have ice?
No.
So you're following in your fathers footsteps?
Why?
Keshavan told me you joined the police.
It's not that simple. They will only hire me if I got selected.
Hey, you'll surely get through.
If your mind is well, everything works out.
Sethu, I've been searching for you.
When did you come?
- An hour ago. Ambika is also with me.
I've been wanting to come for a month, but never found time.
I'll be returning only after some days.
Should I pay?
- No need. Please note that.
Shall I make one more?
- Yes, one more... No need.
I've to tell you something personally, Sethu.
I met Dad at the junction on the way.
After all I'm your bro-in-law?
Shouldn't he show me that much respect, or at least courtesy?
Maybe Dad was in duty...
- What 'looty'? Here, I tell you..
I'm not the type who barges into places uninvited. I've self respect.
I'd planned to take the next bus back.
But decided not to for your sake. Ramanan is full of love!
I know that.
At least you're on my side. Everyone else has forsaken me.
Why'd you leave your job?
I can work with sincerity, but not as a slave.
If superiors try to rule me, I can't bow down to them.
They pay me only 1200 rs.
Would that suffice to even smoke cigarettes?
I need a job that pays ten thousand a month.
Didn't you try to clear your tenth grade
exams which You failed?-Nope, why?
If there are openings for Collectors,
Chief secretaries, you should try for them.
Krishna, brother! I have good news.
What is it?
Weren't you criticizing me and calling me stupid?
Well, here's the interview letter for Sethu.
Oh, that's what you meant? - Why, aren't you happy about it?
Achu, I came to know this before you.
Devi knew it before noon. We're done celebrating, too.
Devi made excellent palpayasam. If there's
any remaining, ask Bharathi to serve you.
So only I was uninformed. Is the rascal here?
How long have you been praying? Let's go.
You never let me pray if I'm with you. You're always in a hurry.
What do you pray so much about?
Whatever I wish.
What'd you pray for?
I heard you murmuring a lot.
Was chanting mantras. -You shouldn't
be chanting whatever you think.
So tell me what you prayed for.
Interview should be smooth, selection should be done quickly..
Then?-Then, he should take me with
him as soon as possible without problems.
Oh I agree. As soon as training's over,
next day we shall marry. And after
10 months little Sethu will be born.
We don't need a kid so fast.
We shouldn't postpone it much.
Following year, a small Devi, then small Sethu..
Within 100 years, we'll have our own Kaurava army.
I have 300 rs, is that enough?
More than enough for 2 days.
I hope you've prepared well.
- Don't worry about that, Dad.
I came 4th in physical test, didn't I.
This time, I'll at least come 2nd, if not 1st.
Number 2 also means the toilet.
Get lost.
Why did you came here?
Came to send sethu off. I'm his only bro-in-law.
You don't need to come Dad, I'll go myself.
Keep this if you need it. Don't waste time, now leave.
How dare you use my car as if you own it?
You can't park here sir, see the 'no parking' sign?
So what? If I've to visit this
shop, where else do I park?
Why'd you push the constable?
He used my car's horn without my permission.
Move your car away.
I need to visit this shop.
I say, move your car you rascal.
-What if I don't intend to?
Move away.
- Raju, leave him. It's embarrassing.
Sir, this is the MLA's son, Raju.
So what, does he make his own rules.
Tell him to come to the station, and get the key.
You went overboard.
Sir, he pushed away the police constable.
Just cos he's MLA's son, isn't he subject to rules?
You'll screw up my career.
I've barely 6 months left, don't get me suspended before that.
Sir, don't be afraid.
He brought down a ministry in a single day.
What do you think will happen to this station?
Hello. Yes Sir, Sub Inspector speaking.
It was a mistake, I'm innocent.
Head constable no. 2624, Achuthan Nair.
Sir, please don't create problems. He's a naive fellow.
He received good-service medal twice.
Yes Sir, I'll tell him. Thank you.
You're safe. Quickly take the car over to that guy's house, and apologize.
Me?-Who else? Don't waste time, make it fast.
I won't go. I've worn this uniform for 25 years. I respect it.
If I've to resign because of this incident, I will.
I will feed my family by doing farming.
Your Dad made a very stupid mistake.
What's the big deal in apologizing to that guy?
My Dad will not bow down before everyone.
Great. Let him suffer now.
There's no suffering in this.
At maximum, he'll lose his job, that's all
My kids know how to live without extravagance.
Krishna, I don't get why you say this. -I only ask you not to be stubborn.
Police driver returned the car to him.
If I was stubborn, I wouldn't have allowed it.
I would've filed a case.
Shall I talk to them? Let's try to solve it like that?
I already told him that already.
Not needed. You want me to apologize?
For that I should be born again.
Past 9 pm. My stomach creates gas problems when I starve.
I'm used to having dinner at 8 no matter what.
Serve them food. Where's Lata?
Inside. The kids are worried after hearing this.
Why don't you say anything?
Don't take it seriously. I'm worried
only 'cos you look perplexed.
That MLA rogue seriewed it up.
We got a message in the morning.
Well he can't order me to be beheaded,
can he? Either transfer or suspension.
It's a transfer.
The messenger came here in person.
Don't care which world I go to.
Where ever we go, we have to work.
I haven't promised anyone that
I will work in this station forever.
The kids exam's are over.
Now I've nothing to worry about.
Good morning, Sir.
You can relieve me now, can't you? Order states you've to join within 24 hours.
Why 24 hours? New place isn't America, is it?
There's a way out.
Apply medical leave with yesterday's date.
Within a week, I can sort it somehow.
I can make someone recommend for you,
or meet MLA personally.
Hand me the relieving order, Sir. I'll join in 6 hours.
Ramapuram, you know nothing of that place!
There's no station with more criminals cases.
My 1st posting as ASI was there, and I'd a tough time then.
Better not go there.
Aren't the policemen there like us?
If I die there, so be it.
I can proudly die in my uniform.
When the head is present, tail should not wag.
I'm still here, alive and well to attend the phone.
Hello.
Hello.Yes.
What?
Is anyone dead?
Alright.
What's your name?
What? Hello.
Hello.
If he can't state his name, then why'd he bother calling?
What is it?
A market fight. What can police do about?
What must be fought, should be fought out.
Which group? Keerikadan Jose or..
- Who cares?
If any of them die, it's a relief.
Whoever dies, take them to the hospital before 5 pm.
I don't want to guard corpses at night.
Alright. I know that during guard duty you end up sleeping at home.
Greetings.
- What do you want?
Punishment, eh. Yes.
- Isn't SI in town?
Why do you need SI to join? The ASI will do.
I simply asked.
SI is in the hospital.
- What happened?
Someone beat him up in the night. He was alone on motorcycle.
Don't be scared. If you play safe there won't be problems.
Have you heard of Keerikadan Jose?
-No.
I see. You will get to know them.
Give the joining report and sign in.
Hameed, pass me the register.
They don't allow us to stick Jose's photo.
He comes himself to tear it out.
He was punished for a few murder cases.
But family is rich and famous.
Drink up, please.
I've been here for last 10 years.
I've not faced any problems.
I've to guard corpses once in while, which is just my duty.
It's late, shall I leave?
Najeeb? Pass the key to the westside house.
Let me be frank. I started making money only after coming here.
We have to live even after retirement, right?
What say? Do you make any 'extra income' too?
Are you a student?
Is there any use in filling up a leaky pot?
He has no time to even eat or sleep.
He's on duty 24 hours,
fooling around at market.
Time to leave.
Take a few mats.
- No thanks.
It's a new place. Najeeb will stay with you if you want.
Looks like he didn't like us.
Doesn't matter. We only need the rent.
Sir, I'm Achuthan Nair.
Same yesterday, right? ASI told me. Come in.
No Sir, thanks.
I went to the hospital yesterday.
I was discharged in morning. It's a small injury.
Didn't you recognize the attacker?
Well it was a fast attack at night...
and they ran as soon as I fell.
Perhaps they did it to scare me.
Don't be scared, Achuthan.
-I came to apply for 2 day's leave.
Found a house, and need to bring my family.
What's happening, dad? -I got a transfer.
This fast?
It's a long story.
How was the interview?
It went well. I think I've impressed the interviewers.
Lord, what a relief.
Why don't you look happy mom?
Give some respect to the future police man.
You're my son. I'll always be happy.
Mom and me are worried about fast change.
But we must go. Ramanan and Ramesh will go today with luggage.
We'll leave tomorrow.
Ramapuram isn't far away.
I can visit you anytime.
I promise I'll come every week.
I couldn't sleep yesterday night. Couldn't console myself.
Why are you acting like a kid?
Sethu...
Grand-mom is here, wipe your tears. Quick. -Sethu.
What?
Will you come once in a while to see me?
- Sure.
After sometime, we'll take you there, right?
Right, Devi?
If so I will come.
I want to see one more thing before I die.
Grandma will only die after seeing your first child.
Take care of your health. Eat to your hearts content.
Find some martial arts guru to learn from.
Where's he? Don't we plan to leave today?
He has started yelling. Come.
Bharathi, visit there once in a while.
- Of course, it goes without saying.
Ammu why are you depressed?
Achu will be there fo maximum 4 years. Then you'll return back.
It's her habit when we shift homes.
After 2 days she will be fine. Let's leave.
I take my leave.
Watching them depressed, one would think we're leaving the country.
Krishna, please change address at post office.
I will take care of it.
Better not delay, leave soon.
Ok. I take my leave.
Why are you fanning yourself outside?
It's so hot.
-Indeed, 'cos it's humid today.
Monsoon is nearing.
- Come let's sit inside.
Sit.
Did your family like the house?
- Please ask them yourself.
This is Hameed.
I've heard about you.
The one standing at back is my third child.
He's the eldest son, and he's second son. There's another girl elder to him.
What's your name?
- Sethu. I was going exploring this place.
Just as we start speaking, the power is off.
Dude. The new tenants at your house
are awesome.
I spotted 2 chicks. You were hiding this
info weren't you?
Hey Suresh.. - Don't dare think you can enjoy all by yourself.
There's a nice one in a skirt.
When I stared, she stared back at me.
And the elder one is sweet too.
Are there more?
Yea, there are. - Really? Anyway, I'm booking the young one.
What size is the other one?
Too young or..
This size, are you interested?
- What size?
Same height and weight as me, aged in between those 2 girls.
Try hitting on me, will you?
He's just blabbering. Loser,
this is their brother, Sethu.
Don't take it seriously Sethu,
it happens to him all the time.
He's Suresh, sen of ASI Gopalakrishnan. Sorry, very sorry.
Such a shame. I haven't you told me earlier?
Come here.
Along with my sisters, my mom is also there...
My god...
- Not that.
I was just warning you to behave yourself.
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. - No need to ask for forgiveness.
What was your name?
- Suresh.
He is a nice guy. -Yeah. No problem.
We can't sell fish in this market.
You have no idea how much we spend to take fish from the harbor.
You need this for supporting Keerikkadan.
Anyone else in this market is able to sell fish other than Keerikkadan?
There is also other fish markets around 5 km.
Then why are you still here?
If you dare, he will kill you and burn your vehicle.
You people deserve this.
When Hassan was cut to pieces on the streets, none agreed to seeing it.
Did you shopkeepers ever face problems when Hassan was around?
You're right, Hydros. For 100 bucks a week, Hassan was better.
No torture, like Jose does now. Who'll stop Jose now?
I can do it if I want.
He isn't meant to live long.
If I don't cut him to pieces one day, my father is not usman.
Do you know?
Brother this is the best beef you can find.
Come here. Tell me how much you want.
Brother I know you. Don't go there he will cheat you.
How much do you want? This is good meat.
Buy from here. Mathu pack him a kilo.
Brother that's the meat of a buffalo died of disease.
Come here. Buy this first quality meat.
Come here. How much do you want?
Let me go. I will buy from there.
- From where?
If you want, buy it from here.
Thampi he came to buy from my shop.
This is Keerikkadan Jose's shop. If you don't buy from here, he won't let you live.
Let him go. Only Keerikkadan should live here?
Don't speak too much.
Give me the collection.
How much?
- Rs. 1000.
Why is it taking time to sell? Bring the remaining amount home.
Listen you dogs. If you don't behave
yourself I will cut you into pieces...
and sell with meat.
Keep it in mind.
Move.
I was expecting a fight.
None is brave enough.
Hydros is only good for babbling.
I haven't seen a good fight in a long time.
Two years back there was a fight between Keerikkadan Jose and Minnal Ramu.
Minnal Ramu is also a thug?
No he was the previous SI.
He was strong.
He was transferred here to deal the thugs.
The fight was like in a movie.
Minnal Ramu sir was annihilated.
After that he Went for treatment
and applied for transfer.
Is this Jose that dangerous?
'Is he'? One day I'll how him to you.
His hands and legs are iron.
You should see him eat.
He drinks blood goat in the morning
and runs all the way home, 3 kms.
Then eats monkeys, porcupines etc
on the way. Won't even spare the cats.
But anyway, he's close to Dad.
He helped Dad solve some issues related to transfer.
He's close to politicians.
They send him to do their killing.
Oh, it's scary listening to this.
Well, we're used to this.
He's trouble only if he loses temper.
Losing temper means somebody will die.
There was a fellow called Jacob, in Mumbai.
He escaped to Mumbai after slashing Jose.
Next thing we heard was, he is dead.
I think Jose himself killed him.
That's true. There was this other...
- I've had enough.
My head aches hearing this.
Hey!
Are you counting eash?
You beggar.- Son of a donkey. Don't need me, do you?
You only give money to Jose's tail wagers you shameless old timer.
Old man, is something stuck in your
mouth? Won't you lend a 100 Bucks?
Do you know me, I'm Hydros?
If I don't cut out your hand, change my
Dad's name from Usman to something else.
Pujapura central jail is for goons like us.
- Hey Hydros, you made me miscalculate.
Get lost, man. Such a bugger.
That knife, I'm going to throw it away. Hang on, kid. This guy's just showing off.
Urmees, if Jose's men are around, ask them to come here.
Trying to scare me using Keerikadan Jose's name? Bad try.
One day, this Hydros will stab Jose.
Your tongue is out of control, it will get you killed soon.
Son, what do you want?
- Half sack of rice.
Give him half a sack of rice.
Who are you?
Newcomer here. Son of new head
constable Achuthan nair.
My name is Sethu.
Oh, a policeman. Give me 10 bucks.
- Don't give him.
You stay put, man.
We shall meet again. And you, watch out.
I'll kick you around like a football one day, just wait.
He's just kidding. Please get the rice.
How can you live here peacefully?
Why aren't policemen doing anything about it?
Policemen get bribed plenty, he will tell you.
Yes, they get bribes. But that's not the only reason.
We policemen and our families want to live peacefully too, don't we?
Mom, they play around with knives this huge. Very dangerous for us.
Cop or soldier, you can still be stabbed.
Now I think I should find another job.
- Come on Sethu, we're Men, aren't we?
The one year training in the police force will help you get over it.
Then you can stand up even elephants, right Hameed?
Of course.
Well, the trained cops posted here are still unable to stop these animals.
Sister, every man values his life.
There are a lot of stories around here.
You know Hydros, who scares people with a knife?
There was a guy Hassan, who was his boss.
He used to rule the market.
A real boar.
He was killed by Jose.
Cut into 10 pieces and thrown away, right in mid-day.
Was there no case against him?
Yes, but it wasn't valid. None dared give statements against Jose.
People want to stay live. Jose once suspected a guy and
that guy was dragged out and beaten up.
Then that guy died in 5-6 months. -Oh Lord!
Jose started from there.
He's accused in 8-10 murder cases,
but convicted for only 3.
If someone even dares point a finger at him, he's dead for sure.
He has contacts in Trivandrum.
So what can we helpless policemen do?
I wish we got out of here. -I need to see this guy.
Why?
- Er..Simply...
Move away.
Please don't beat me up.
How dare you challenge Jose.
Achuthan, let them fight it out.
What are you saving? Leave him alone. Go away.
Leave me. Let go of my shirt.
If I don't?
- If you don't..
Get into the vehicle. You too. Hameed?
Son! Sethu! Don't!
Sethu, son.
Son, leave it.
Achuthan Nair, let them be. Let him go.
Leave me alone.
Sethu.
Leave me alone, Sir. Son, spare him.
Keerikadan is dead.
Keerikadan Jose has been murdered.
Brother.
If he grows restless, give him more anesthetic.
Did he pass urine yet?
- No he didn't.
Oh it's ok, it's not compound injury.
Doctor, how's the situation?
Parameswaran only has bone fracture, but Jose is very serious.
It's a head injury.
We can't conclude before 24 hours.
He insists on being taken to private hospital.
But there are no better treatments for a head injury.
He's a criminal, is it?
Notorious. Everyone wishes his death, even me.
Of course, we can't wish that can we.
People in his locality are celebrating his death already.
"Keerikadan Jose is dead and gone" "Long live Sethumadhavan"
What madness are you doing?
- Tell that to your Dad.
That's what I just did.
I'm going crazy. Are you joining these goons or what?
Just for the fun, we...
Fun? Don't get yourself killed. Know what's really fun? That Jose isn't dead.
Once he's back, he'll butcher you all.
If he does return, we won't submit to him anymore.
Mr. Gopal, Sethu's our friend. Jose shivers in fear of that name.
Really? So where's your hero?
Until the fight was over, neither he or his Dad knew who he was fighting.
But he fled as soon as he realized that. I wonder if he'll ever return.
Dad?
I wasn't home when Ramanan came for me. Devi has been crying.
Wonder if he went to my house. No one would find him there.
No he won't go there.
Shall we find a lawyer?
- What's the point? All is lost.
Achu, you're worse than Ammu.
You should gave courage to your family.
How can I console them?
If he dies, my son will be convicted in murder.
I'd wished to see him in police uniform.
These days, if you're rich you can confine it to a petty case.
Jose himself killed so many, but was punished for few. That's all.
Police jeep!!
Sethu hasn't come. I'll surrender him to you as soon as he does.
Well, let's talk.
Greetings.
I don't recognize you.
I'm Sethu's uncle, Krishnan Nair.
My son is innocent, Sir.
He woudn't hurt even an ant. Please save him.
Ammu.
Go inside.
He's a criminal. She's talking out of ignorance.
It's not ignorant for a mom to ask protection for her son.
I'm but a policeman, Sir.
- So? We're not just that.
I know your son did it by mistake. I'll do all I can to help, ok?
Go in peace, I need to talk.
Please go away.
- Keshu, leave.
You too.
- Didn't you recognize me?
Yes. Now leave. Don't hide over
there, just leave.
Achuthan Nair,
We've done several favors for many people.
We pretend that we saw some things and sometimes we didn't.
All of that for someone else.
Sometimes, we should help ourselves too.
FIR doesn't mention Sethu at all.
Another rowdy with a grudge against Jose is accused.
I took the statements in that way, too.
There's no need for that, sir, I won't stand by it.
No need. No one is asked you to stand by it.
Don't bother searching for Sethu.
I know where he is.
He came first to me, after the incident.
I want to see him.
He'll come after situation is under control.
Jose's statement is the key.
If he can't give a death statement,
well, It depends on our luck.
Jose.
Tell me, who hit you.
I don't know.
What?
-I don't know.
Can you recognize his face?
- No.
Sir, Jose hasn't fully regained
consciousness. He'd surely remember.
Shut up. I'm taking his Statement, not your's.
I'm fully conscious, but don't remember. Anything.
Jose, what are you saying?
I want to finish him myself.
Won't allow him to escape into the safety of the prison.
The market was a fun and happening
place when Jose was around.
Now it's boring. -Who's this Sethu?
Don't you know? The new policeman Achuthan Nair's son.
Look, That's him.
Are you returning home? -Yes.
We're your supporters.
I sell rice, not gold. Don't mock me Menon. Sure... Hey, boss.
Please come here.
Don't ignore me like this.
Urmees, get a chair.
No need. -Have a cool drink.
Urmees, make a nice lime juice.
Salt or sugar?
Told you I don't want it.
Fine, then. If you have need cash for the case,
send someone here.
I was being heavily tortured by
Jose when you stepped in...
Sethu brother.
Do you know how long I've been waiting?
Now no one will create problems here.
All shivering in their bones. Let's go. You lead ahead.
Think he's an angry type.
Gives a tiger's stares.
Any brave pigs out there, show yourselves now.
Where are Keerikadan's sidekicks?
Keerikadan is a mere nothing in front of us.
Listen. I will go alone.
Be careful, they're out to kill you. - Let them kill me if they want to.
Guts. What a courageous fellow.
Please Mom, eat something.
I'm not hungry.
Where the hell is my son now?
That sir said he knew.
Nothing will happen to him.
If you don't eat, you will fall ill, Mom.
I want to see my son, then I can die in peace.
He will come. Sir said there is no case in his name.
Mom, Sethu brother is here.
Sethu, son, how could you do this?
You don't hurt people even with words.
When he hits Dad on the streets, should I stand still?
If Dad's dead body was all that's left,
won't you ask me, Mom?
Would you've forgiven me then, sister?
You'd ask me why I stood still?
Whatever happened, who're you to take law into your own hands?
I did my job, my duty. I might die in the line of duty.
I did the duty of a son. I'm ready to accept punishment for it.
You didn't think of your future, son. I did. Thought of everything. But..
Hey. Let's go home. Not safe to stay here any more.
We should help them in bad times, right?
True, but you won't be left with a head.
But then, there's no point going home either.
Here comes one, I warned you. Wonder if he's out to murder us?
Who're you? What do you want?
- Sethu's friend.
You're his sis and brother in law, right? I know.
Sethu's not here.
He went to his native place.
Tell him Hydros came.
Are you coming with me? Let's hang out together for sometime.
No, he is not coming.
Don't worry, sister. I'm just asking for friendships sake.
We are all one, aren't we. Are you coming?
When he call me with love
how can I refuse?
May I go?
- Here, get on.
Want to grab a drink?
Have no cash.
Cash? Sethu's brother-in-law and friend need none to get drunk.
These folks can't continue business after that. Come on. I'll park the cycle.
Got hurt? -No.
Bro-in-law.
Some losers around here say Sethu is a coward.
The father of the guy who said that is a coward.
Courage is something we've inherited.
My granddads granddad was one of the commander of King of Kochi's army.
Let that be. Sethu's grad-dad, a whole village feared him.
Let that also be. I alone can beat up jose and his men to pulp.
They say he's out for Setu's head
when he returns.
Who? Which brat? He can't
hurt a hair on Sethu.
Let Jose get out of hospital and bring his army.
A whole load of bodies will fall dead here.
How many?
- 2 loads.
We should control ourselves.
Impaitience leads us to such things.
You were always impatient.
Only you'd tell me that. At least now will you listen to me?
Devi, I didn't come to be advised,
but to be consoled.
I'm tired of advice. Do I look like a goon to you?
No not like that.
I'm not a primary schoolchild.
Don't talk like a teacher, understand my worries.
I'm don't feel proud for beating up a goon.
I don't have the guts for it either. It just happened.
I'm sad for that. And a bit scared.
If Jose or Parameshwaran really want to thrash me, I stand no chance.
One day they'll come for my life. - Sethu, don't return to that cursed land.
There's no use not returning.
Fate will befall me wherever I am.
Here or there.
When does selection list come after interview?
Who knows? Maybe 2-3 months. That's my only hope,
Sethu.
Sethu? I never got to speak to you.
This girl's always sad. It's natural for guys to get into brawls, right?
If I was like you, I would've died of sorrow.
Did you thrash him up properly?
Good you didn't kill. Grand-dad was like that.
He'd leave a guy clinging onto life.
We've no right to take life that God created.
Granny, keep quiet will you? You and your husband.
What's your problem?
What wrong did I do?
Tell me what happened in detail.
Why don't you leave grandma?
She wants to enjoy the story.
Her heart is full of wickedness.
Come with me Sethu.
She's scared. At her age, I was like that too.
Then I began enjoying seeing blood clotted, like a hibiscus flower.
I am afraid of that.
I feel dizzy seeing blood.
- Sethu will you come here?
I'll tell the story later sometime, Granny.
As far as I heard, they stop at nothing. Be careful.
Sometimes I think I should stand up to all of them.
I feel weak when I see Mom and Dad, though.
Let's not create new problems.
Stay away from them as much as possible.
We have more to lose.
See you later.
It's from granny, might be food.
You want some?-No.
Sethu.
Please be careful.
What's wrong with your Mom, are we short on food?
That's not the point. Mom's food is special.
What'd Devi say?
- She acted the teacher.
That's all.
Did she give you some canings?
What's this?
Dad's old knife? How'd it get here?
Granny must've gifted grandson, isn't it?
She said she left a gift.
- Gift it seems.
Your Mom's truly crazy, look at her gift.
See, things are settling down now.
Iif something goes wrong, I'll kill you myself.
Why blame him? What'd he do?
I had to mention. Don't go fooling around like before.
Even if you go, don't go alone.
Go with Ramanan or Hameed's son, etc.
Got it?
- No, just a letter from a friend.
PSC red tape, it'll take time.
- Where to now?
Home.
Aren't you tired of sitting alone at home?
Well, yes. But what else can I do?
Joke's guys are out there. Not making a move 'cos they're scared.
If they get an opportunity they will act.
He can't live in fear like this forever.
Are you scared, Sethu?
I'm not scared.
But I don't want to create problem again.
Hey, we're with you aren't we. Be courageous.
You can show some attitude around here now.
You don't know your own value.
Know how many people in town claim to be 'Your men'?
My men?
An elephant does now know it's own size. You are a ..
We'll show you what your social image
is now. Have you had alcohol shots?
No just a little bit beer once.
Then let's have beer. Let's go to bar,
and have some beer.
I never go to bars. Just drink secretly
by myself.
Why, is it wrong to go to a bar?
No. just that I never go.
- Don't worry. It's a jolly place.
No...
- Then just company us.
I won't drink, I can accompany you if you want.
- That's enough.
Get on.
Come in.
Dot you know him?
- No, don't recognize. Who's he?
Sethu.
Sorry. Forgive me. We've never met before.
Order whatever you want, Sir, please sit.
Raja, seat him at a convenient place.
Please sit.
Order whatever you want. Hydros and
your brother-in-law visit here often.
Come.
Drink up, man.
No I don't want. Drink up fast, then let's leave.
Hey don't be in a hurry man.
I tell you something, we'd sacrifice
our lives for you, Sethu.
Even if Keerikkadan Jose comes
we'd be with you, what say?
Of course. If Jose comes, I'll slit his throat and feed him to dogs.
Who's laughing? Mocking us?
Hey Najeeb, you'd do nothing to Jose.
Stop bluffing while drinking, just go home.
Hey Najeeb.
Let's show this guy who's boss. He's mocking us.
What do you say Sethu?
- Najeeb, it's me Nasser.
No dog should repeat this. Keerikadan is nothing in front of Sethu.
Najeeb, stop blabbering when you're drunk.
Sethu brother, I was kidding.
Why does he have to interfere in this?
Hey, stop it. Don't create problems.
- It's not me.
It's not me.
I didn't do anything.
It's not me, I've done nothing.
-You underestimate us.
What happened?
The new rowdy, Sethu. Seems he's gotten drunk.
Call the police then.
Achuthan Nair.
Your son decided to get ruined, tell him to leave my kid.
What happened?
Your son created a fight at a bar.
My son Najeeb and Gopalan's son tried to stop him, and got hit.
What's Sethu thinking?
That can't happen.
-What can I say.
Ask the bar owners if you want. It's local gossip now.
What should I do to him?
What can I say? You've many children, but I have only one.
Please let him survive. It's my request.
Dad, my results will be out tomorrow.
Where's the rogue, your brother?
He's inside.
Sethu.
What Dad?
You are messed up, and now you are messing up other people?
What happened here? -Ask your son.
What happened son?
- Don't know, Mom.
You don't know?
You liar.
Your son got drunk and fought at the bar.
Hameed's son also got hit because of him.
Is this true?
No Mom, I didn't make the fight, or even drink.
Really? Hameed just told me, that guy got hit 'cos of him.
You will make the whole town your enemy.
Is it true? -No.
Haven't you gone to the bar?
-Yes I have.
Why would you go there if not to drink?
You won't believe me, if I told
you that I went for no reason.
Profile of 'Sethu' is different in this town.
And now, even you're all beginning to see me differently.
Who're you hanging around? -Went to check my Bro's results.
Did he pass his exam?
-Yes.
I heard that you creating problems in town?
Protecting you that day was a mistake right?
Are you trying to become another Jose?
Sir that hurts. What're you accusing me of?
You created problems at the bar the other day, didn't you?
That wasn't me.
Don't lie I know everything.
I also heard that you're challenging people.
Me?!!
You make your sidekicks do it. That's bad enough.
Is Hydros your bodyguard?
No.
Since the day you landed, he's been around you.
You extort through him and your brother-in-law?
No Sir, this is atrocious.
Don't act in front of me.
I've seen this before.
I helped you once 'cos I thought you were innocent and I respected your Dad.
If you make trouble, I'll break your bones.
Can't tolerate another Jose being born here, ok?
Don't try to eyeball me.
Need some cash, Ramakrishna.
-I haven't done any business yet.
When will you do business? Whenever
I ask, you haven't done business.
If I lose temper, I'll break this place down.
Cool down Hydros, he'll pay up.
Must Sethu himself some to ask you?
That's why he sent his brother-in-law.
Hand over 50 bucks if you want to continue with business.
Pay up. Don't piss off Hydros. We need it for Sethu.
Make it fast.
How dare you extort in my name. - Hydros just took it as a loan.
You are the ones spoiling my name.
Son-of-a-bitch, I almost died for you. And you hit me?
Nobody need pay for my sake.
I'm not a thug, and I don't need that money.
We can't bear this. We're of honorable lineage.
We never had goons in our family.
Send your daughter to me when you want. If you don't, still fine.
Ramanan, stay calm. Let us ask.
- Here is where he hit me. It still aches.
Why'd he hit you?
Because I tried to stop him when they fight for the extorted money.
Why should I bear this?
Ramanan, If you leave now you can reach there before night.
I'll return in a week.
No.
I shall...
I said no.
Mom shall I leave?
Sure, leave.
- I'll return after 2 weeks.
Wonder what he's lying about.
-There's some truth to it.
His clothes were soiled when he came.
My son won't hurt anyone.
There comes your son.
Who've you killed now?
Haven't killed, but I beat up Hydros.
He was extorting money in my name.
Really? Why he need your name for that?
Who are you to correct them?
Improve yourself first.
Why'd you hit Ramanan? -I didn't.
But if he does this nonsense, I will.
What stupidity this is, Sethu. At least wait till we reach our graves.
Stop. This is not a house for rogues.
I've other children.
I have to consider their future.
Will you live honorably or as a rowdy?
Clarify if you want to enter.
Sethu.
Son, what's this? What're you thinking?
Mom...
life is getting out of control. Anything I do turns into a mistake.
Don't know what I'll transform into.
Look at your clothes.
I'm tired of washing them. They were all soiled.
What's your plan. Aren't you going home?
I should.
Dad will lose his sleep trying to search for me.
And will want to apologise to me.
I want to return home before that.
I can't see dad lose. I'd rather be a loser here.
There's a numbness growing in me.
Rather, a kind of new found courage.
How else could I beat up Hydros?
Aren't you seeing Devi?
-No.
She thinks I'm a schoolchild who'll listen to advice.
Did you see Sethu? Dad?
- No.
I heard that he's around, but then why didn't he visit here?
Did he get into some fight?
- Mom, shut up and pray.
Krishnan uncle.
What happened Ramanan?
What happened?
I escaped with my life. Honorable people cannot live there.
I could've stayed here and I know
you'd be happy to have me.
Still I went there 'cos I considered that house my own. No more..
Let them be.
Tell me what happened, Ramanan.
I would've been part of a murder.
Sethu almost killed a rowdy today.
When I tried to stop him, he beat me too.
And then?
-What has happened to him?
The argument was on extorted money.
A week ago, he quarreled at a bar.
He won't survive at this rate.
Listen, I won't allow a goon to marry my daughter.
Don't jump to conclusions without knowing the truth.
I know him, I won't believe this.
Is that him?
- I don't see anyone.
Didn't you sleep? Yes, just woke up now.
If you feel tensed, I'll search. No need.
It's late, where can you search?
I'll search somewhere. After all, I'm the reason for this.
If I talk, it will turn into a quarrel.
Son and Mom can talk in peace.
When did you come?
Sometime ago.
You should've woken us up.
Come, have dinner.
No. I'm not hungry.
Parameshwaran is in town.
You better stay away from home.
Until you know what he's up to, better
go into hiding.
I'll bring you food.
-No need.
It's not a problem, I won't let
anyone know.
There's a problem. You don't need to destroy yourself for Sethu.
Thanks for letting me know. Now leave.
Sethu..
Brother.
Grandma's gift. Think I need it now.
- Please throw it away.
Quiet.
I won't hurt anyone on punpose.
It's for self defense. Don't scare parents by telling them this.
Whoever asks for me, tell I'm
not at home these days.
Don't worry.
Ammu.
We're saved. Police selection list has come, Sethu's ranked second.
God, finally my son can escape this hell.
And this, for you.
Interview call from University College. Look at him, he's happy.
Where's he new? I need to tell him.
Hey.
Save yourself.
Within 24 hours if I didn't cut your limbs,
me Parameshwaran will commit suicide.
I want to live.
Brought you here so you won't die in solitude.
Achuthan, don't worry.
When we found him, he simply surrendered and came.
We never hurt him. He'll become one of us soon, right?
Parameshwaran's hands had to be removed.
Relieving in a way. He can't hurt anyone.
Achuthan Nair.
What're you doing? Come here, I say.
Stop this stupidity.
What madness is this?
If he dies in our custody, I'll be held responsible.
You may kill him, sir. I don't want him anymore.
Did you see my son?
Yes.
Tomorrow he'll be presented in court.
We need to bail him out.
Will they punish him?
- Achu.
When did you come?-At dusk.
Thought I'd leave after you came.
I need to talk to you.
Come.
Bharathi and her relatives are compelling
me to marry off Devi soon.
I was thinking, too. Once married,
he'd become more responsible.
He's selected now, and will be posted soon.
I meant something else.
We know a guy through Bharathi's relatives.
Shivashanker from Dubai, based in Koratty.
His proposal is being considered.
I didn't want to agree. But after these incidents..
You're right Krishnan.
Better not wait for Sethu. He's lost to us.
You may give your word.
Achu, please don't resent me.
Never.
If my daughter Latha was in the same
situation as Devi,
I would've done the same.
I wouldn't even have given it a second thought.
May Devi be in peace.
She isn't agreeing. She says she won't
let go even if Sethu tells her.
When he comes out on bail, shall we ask Sethu to speak to her?
When they fought as kids, you'd to ask him to discipline the other kids.
This is like that. Is this necessary, Krishna?
I couldn't bear it, that's why I..
I know.
You may leave, Dad.
Tell Mom not to worry.
Devi's marriage is coming up.
Krishnan uncle had come.
They think you may create problems when it happens.
I promised that won't happen.
It's a school, there are teachers around. Don't cry.
I came out on bail today.
Don't cry.
I won't allow it. Take me away, this moment. I'll come with you.
Then?
-We shall live together.
It won't happen. I'm not ready.
I'm losing everything. I have to lose you too,
else you'll become an obligation for me.
Obligation? -Yes.
Yes. Lot things to sort out. I can't
think of you in between that.
Moreover, you're no longer in my heart.
- Sethu...
I won't tell you what to do. Marry someone if you want. Else...
I can suicide, right?
You have to forget me.
Don't be scared.
I didn't come to quarrel or threaten.
I said a final goodbye. Console her.
You will all be fine.
Hameed?
There's a document requiring police verification.-Whose?
Sethu Madhavan's. For SI selection.
- That will become a problem.
That's what I'm thinking too.
We shouldn't have registered that case. It was a criminal case, what could do?
Sir, please don't make me handle it. Give it to someone else.
How can you say that?
I've to reply to this.
Is Achuthan Nair there?
Yes. I'll call him.
A police verification document regarding
Sethu Madhavan.
What should I do?
- Do as you please, Sir.
What's the point of that?
It affects your son's career.
Let me try to close the case in some way.
This will stay untouched till then. -Ok Sir.
He hasn't been able to work, sir.
He was hospitalized in medical hospital for 2 months, and 1 month here.
We have 2 kids, I'm their only guardian.
That's what I'm saying.
Till now you've were a goon. Now what can you do?
You can't even eat with that hand.
I'll set up a cycle shop for you.
And a boy to clean up and move the stuff around.
You'll get enough to support Your family.
You won't gain anything by winning the case or punishing Sethu.
What say? Can you do as I said?
I'm leaving.
Don't you recognize me, sir? -I do.
Then why don't you acknowledge.
- Reply to him.
You thought Jose would die, didn't you?
Just got out now.
Remember this - if you hurt Jose, he grows stronger. After 3 months in the hospital,
I gained 10 kilos.
- Good.
I'm not done. I'll cut down that rascal
who break his hand, and you support.
His hands will be payback for him.
Body will be sent to his cop dad.
Head to your quarters. Then try to indict me in court, if you've any guts.
Don't worry.
After verification, you're safe.
Then you will have the protection of khakhi,
and the support of the force.
Don't waste time thinking.
Leave this place soon.
Save your life first.
Who else among you celebrated my death?
All those pure souls who lighted candles
for Jose to die, remember this.
I will find each of you.
Wherever that pig is hiding, I won't spare him either.
What happened to you? - Jose is back.
He's taking revenge. Man by man, hit by hit.
Does anyone at home know about your whereabouts?
I told Ramesh.
I need to escape off to somewhere.
Came here to meet you. What if I can't see you again.
What nonsense. Where are you going?
Don't know. I need some cash.
Now..
If you don't have, fine.
-Why don't you stay here tonight?
No one will find you here quickly.
Tomorrow we'll get some money.
Mother...
Who're you people? Leave me.
Where is your son? -I don't know.
If you don't tell me, I won't spare any of your lives.
If I don't get him, I'll bury each one of you.
I will come again.
Did you get the cash?
- Yes.
I came to know some news from Krishnan uncle.
Jose and gang attacked your house yesterday.
Dad wasn't home. Ramesh and your mom are in hospital.
What's the use of worrying? Better not go there.
No Keshu, I must to go. If they don't
get me, they'll destroy my family.
For me, they would.. No, I will go.
Sethu, let's think about this.
There's nothing to think about. I need to go?
Keep this money.
-I don't need the cash anymore.
Here we separate!
If I die, tell Dad I never loved anyone as much as him.
I'm sorry for shattering all his dreams.
Sethu.
I don't have strength to fight them.
What they want is my life. I'll repay it to them.
I'll come with you Sethu. I'm with you.
If you want to hit back, I'll will be with you.
You've done enough for me, thanks.
Your son is crying, do take care of him.
Go.
Brother! Go away, don't stay here. They'll kill you if they find you.
What're you doing? Such a big girl, crying? People are watching.
They beat you a lot didn't they. -Yes.
Don't worry...
no one will hurt you again.
- Has his anger died down?
It will.
Study well. Don't fool around like her.
Don't become a lawyer. Become a sub-inspector.
Fulfill Dad's wishes, alright?
What do I tell you?
Get married to a house where they'll shower love on you.
Fool. Where's Mom?
- In S2.
Mom.
Don't cry.
Why did you come here? Escape, quick,
to some other place.
I only want to know that you're alive.
- I'm leaving now. Came to say goodbye.
Go quickly.
Jose, Sethu Madhavan has come. -Where is that pig.
-Move away, move away.
Stop laughing.
I've come, prepared for even death.
But not without a fight.
Who else wants to kill me?
Which among you has the guts for it.
I want to kill. Until I'm satisfied.
Move away.
Move away.
Sethu.
Don't come near me.
Sethu.
If you come, I don't give a damn about who you are.
Don't come near me.
Sethu, drop the knife.
- Go away.
Don't come near me.
Don't come.
Sethu.
Sethu.
- Don't come.
Son!
Drop the knife. I say drop it.
- Don't come near me.
Son, please let go of the knife.
It's your dad telling you, drop the knife!
What is this?
Sethu Madhavan's police verification report, sir.
He is not eligible. He is a notorious criminal.
