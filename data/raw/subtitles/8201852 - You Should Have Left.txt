Hi, Baba.
Susanna, come here a sec.

Baba can be weird sometimes.

You have two phones.
Must have been a lot of work

Yeah, it's exhausting.
The guy, Max,
from the shoot in Mexico?
(sighs)
Yeah.
That's too bad.
Has he been here, in this house?
Of course... of course not.
Because somebody wrote
in my journal.
He's not here.
He's in New York.
He has meetings.
I don't give a shit
where Max has meetings.
(sighs):
I'm sorry.
So, who wrote in my book?
Um, I don't know.
Uh, did Ella?
Is that the biggest problem
we have right now?
I bet that guy can fuck you
all night, huh?
Don't make it ugly.
I'm 100% sure that I am not
the one that made this ugly.
I can't do this.
If only you'd said that to Max.
You know, it'd feel a lot better
if you yelled and screamed
like a normal person.
No, thanks.
You got to go.
What? Where?
I don't know.
Not here.
Stay in the village.
I'm not staying
in the fucking village.
- You go if you want to.
- No, you leave.
Fine. I'll take Ella.

You broke the rules.
There are no rules anymore.
(panting)
Other side.
How long am I supposed to stay
in purgatory?
I just need a night to myself.
- So do you.
- Don't tell me what I need.
A night by yourself.
Yes, Theo, I get it...
by myself.
Max is not here.
He has never been here.
Oh, right, 'cause of all
the big meetings in New York.
Can I get in, please?
Hey, listen, um,
you know, I want to take back
that "fuck you all night"
thing I said.
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah, let me be clear...
I don't actually care
who fucks you all night.
- Oh, my God. Jesus.

Yes.

Why not?
What is this place?
Somebody from here, Hans Eagly,
he owns the Lindenhof.
He said an ant doesn't know
what a cathedral is
or a power plant or a volcano.
It's the same with that house.
You don't know
what you can't know.
Are you still there?
We need a taxi now.
Don't shout at me.
I'm not... shouting.
There was a different house
before that one.
What sort of house?
Just different.
And before that, a tower.
Tower?
It's a legend.
The Devil builds a tower
to collect souls,
and God destroys it.
But the Devil just builds it up
again and again.
People have always stayed
in that house.
Some don't leave.
