In the mountains
we became wolves
Our slogan is:
Freedom or death!
We'll go down the valley
carrying our Uzis
ready to fight.
Among the victims
waiting for revenge
among those skinny faces
we'll pay them back
on the barricades
a bullet for a bullet.
We'll pay them back
on the barricades...
War is over!
Why?
You all follow us! Run!
I've never even shot a hen!
I want one too.
Be careful, don't let them kill you!
Women, store the hay
or if it rains it'll get wet.
What do you want?
I want one too.
I cut off the phone lines.
Tigre, give one to me too!
You promised!
Leonida, come here!
Take the charger too.
- Where are you going Leonida?
- I want to kill them too!
.. from the radio station of Milan
which we've just occupied.
Free at last, Milan
welcomes the Italian people.
This is the Command of the
Partisan Brigades "Giacomo Matteotti"
At this very moment of joy
our thought goes to all
those who died on every front
fighting against
the Nazi-fascist barbarians.
But above all...
Leonida! What are you doing here?
I didn't see you get in.
You look so serious!
What do you need that rifle for?
Away!
- Long live Stalin!
- Have you gone nuts?
Long live Stalin!
Attila and Regina!
Attila and Regina!
Remember that day in April,
a long train
which moved...
Regina!
Regina!
Attila!
Here I am!
Come on here!
You asked for it!
Swallows are back
Wait please.
Did you know my
granddad died right there?
Sit down!
Did you know that each cow
has its own drinking trough in America?
But they're American cows,
they live in comfort.
Would you like
to go to America, Leonida?
Call me Olmo.
- You're not Leonida anymore?
- My name as a partisan is Olmo.
- Do you know who Olmo was?
- He was the bravest!
The bravest...
Well, my little warrior, what
do you think about your master?
There's no more masters.
MANY YEARS EARLIER
Verdi is dead!
Giuseppe Verdi is dead!
Push! Push! Push! Push!
- Push! Push!
- Here it comes!
Come on, push!
- Close the door.
- Be quiet kids.
It's a boy! It's a boy!
Rosina had a boy!
It's a boy!
It's a boy! It's a boy!
What about that
irresponsible woman?
Did you hear, darn woman?
The peasant was born
before his master's son!
Should I come up there
and draw out the baby?
Eleonora push!
Come on, let him out!
Push harder!
Come on, push!
Damn it!
Dad.
Dad..
Alfredo was born!
He'll be named after me!
- What if it's a girl?
- It's not a girl, is it?
You think I can't tell the difference?
This baby has a willy!
He's got his father's eyes.
And his grandfather's money.
He's got a willy!
He's got a willy!
Giovanni! Giovanni! Giovanni!
- What?
- How's his mother?
- She's well.
- Kiss her for me.
"Heaven sends us here
like a hot summer wind.
May he bring in his heart
his ancestors' noble virtues"
Okay, we understood.
Giovanni!
- Yes dad?
. Write to that playboy of your brother.
- Write to him, come on.
- Yes, dad.
"Ottavio... " But
haven't you got any paper?
"Ottavio Berlinghieri,
Hotel de Ben. Lido, Venezia.
We give notice of Berlinghieri's
first born in 20th century, period.
I'll pray for him
to be different from you, period.
Found a wife yet,
question mark. Hugs. Dad. "
- Did you write everything down?
- Of course dad.
Good.
Sister Desolata is here!
- Dear brother.
- It's a boy.
Bravo! Bravo!
Take everything out of the car.
I'm not going back to the nunnery.
Monsignor ignores me,
he no longer cares for me.
He likes novices better.
If they came from good families at least!
- Listen. The other day I..
- My hat!
Alfredo!
May the Lord be praised.
My gosh, even this house is full of priests!
I can't escape them!
Hunchback, what do you see?
There's snow, like in winter.
- Then?
- A cathedral with spires!
- Then what?
- Bottles.
- Sorry?
- Bottles.
To life, which smiles on you...
Master, that's Heaven
and you're God almighty.
I wish I had the keys!
I'd be a nice drunk St. Peter!
Here! Get drunk!
Enough with work.
Let's drink now.
Cheers!
This is for you.
No work today.
Vincenzo, this wine is special.
Let's celebrate.
- Thank you master.
- But where's Leo?
Over there.
- No...
- Give it to me, dog!
Libero, do you know who died?
Look at this bottle!
It was fate for them
to be born on the same day.
Let's celebrate!
Mister Alfredo, do you
how many D'Alcòs we are now?
I can't count them.
When I sit at the table
there are 40 of us eating.
Come on Leo, think about it!
He's a peasant but he's a male!
Why? Males don't eat food?
What's wrong with you?
Mine was born before yours.
Everyone knows, peasants
came before their masters.
Masters, peasants, bullshit!
At birth we're all the same.
- All the same?
- Shut up you scoundrel!
Hey you!
What are you waiting for?
I told you to drink, you rascals!
Drink with me.
Ok, let's drink.
Born together!
It has to mean something.
It means the two of us
will die together.
Go to hell, philosopher
my butt!
My grandchild will be a notary.
- Mine'll be a thief.
- Then he can also be a priest.
- This isn't local wine.
- It's too good for you.
I didn't like it too.
Rigoletto, stop drinking,
run to the town hall.
Tell them he's named after me,
Alfredo. Berlinghieri Alfredo.
Son of Giovanni
and Eleonora Rossetti.
Leo, what are you going to call him?
- What?
- What are you going to call your grandkid?
Olmo.
Olmo, like the elm tree.
Olmo D'Alcò, son of Oscar
and Rosina Cop.
Oscar? He died 4 years ago!
It doesn't matter.
We must respect the dead.
What dogs you are!
Summer comes
and it's very hot,
two kids were born
close to each other.
Come on, drink!
The hunchback didn't like it!
Destiny played a trick.
The son of the master
and the bastard peasant
Leo, why don't take a ride too?
I'm not riding that devil.
So, I ploughed three hectares
in ten minutes and all by himself.
Six men need six hours.
And you think you did it well?
Mr. Giovanni, look at
all the hay you left behind...
That's nothing.
You don't believe me, do you?
This thing comes from
abroad, blockhead.
We're the first in the Bassa
to have a mechanic rake.
So Blessed are the last.
This thing has the teeth of a hyena.
Run, Nina, or he'll catch you!
- 19!
- You make me sick!
20! 20!
Wait and you'll see.
- Kiss it, kiss it!
- Go to hell!
Olmo is a bastard!
Olmo is a bastard!
Olmo is a bastard!
Olmo is a bastard!
Eat it!
- Coward!
- Run away, shit face!
You can only scare girls!
- If you're brave you have to do what I do.
- I'm brave!
And you go to hell!
Coward.
What are you doing?
I'm fucking the ground.
- What are you doing now?
- I can hear my dad speak to me.
In the telegraph pole?
I can't hear anything.
- Are you nuts?
- Let's see who's brave and who's a sissy.
When the train comes
close your eyes or you'll get blind.
- Now you can't run!
- Let go of me!
Coward!
Olmo! Olmo!
Olmo!
Are you dead or what?
Ding-dong, ding-dong. The hell
with it and kill the master!
How long does it take
from here to Madonna dei Prati?
About 3 kilometres.
Once I saw a train whose length was
from here to Madonna dei Prati.
And my dick's length
is from here to Piacenza!
And it's as fast as a train too?
Trains are real machines,
not that rake there.
I like to drive that rake,
you're against progress!
It makes me work less, and I'm happy.
- But who do you think pays for it?
- The master does.
We pay for machines with our work.
First he passed his lice on to Paride
and then to the little one
I tried to delouse him,
but he always runs away.
It's not only the lice! Today Olmo
made my Nina eat a living frog!
...and what do you know
about philosophy? Nothing!
I'm the only one who went
to the meeting of the League,
because you can go to meetings
only if you understand things.
Then you can go around
speaking of justice
inside the isolated cottages
where honest peasants work hard,
while the rich bourgeois
despises his labour.
Amen.
Look at him!
- Who's crying?
- Rosina wants to send Olmo to the Seminary.
- Why?
- Because he's a devil!
They want to take away my son,
make him become a priest!
You wanted to had fun?
Now cry!
Leave her be, that's a long time ago!
All the bastards
end up being evil!
Bastard? Who's a bastard?
There are no bastards in my house.
Olmo is your children's brother
because his father is one of us.
Isn't it true, Rosina?
Tell them, Rosina,
as you know.
Of course I know. It's true.
Who else could know?
Olmo!
Olmo D'Alcò!
Olmo, you're a big boy now...
yet you still poop in your pants...
Come here. Remember this,
you'll learn to read and write,
but you'll always be Olmo D'Alcò,
the son of a peasant.
A poor unfortunate.
You'll serve in the army
and you'll see the world.
You must learn to obey.
And to be kicked in the ass!
You'll get married and will have to
work hard to raise your children.
- But who will you always be?
- Olmo D'Alcò.
Olmo D'Alcò. The peasant.
Understood?
No priests in this house.
- What have you got there?
- A coin. It's mine.
Mr. Giovanni gave it to me
in change for my frogs.
If it's yours then it's everyone's.
I'm flying!
Yes, fly, so the branch
will break, wet pants!
Alfredo, dinner's ready!
Listen to the Parisian!
"From the Ville Lumiére
lots of love. Ottavio.
Alfredo!
"Love"! We haven't
seen him for a year!
- He doesn't feel at home here.
- He despises us.
He doesn't.
Your brother Ottavio
knows how to enjoy life.
Paris, Chez Maxime, cocotte...
we work and he eats up our money!
- That's not true. Alfredo, dinner's served!
- Regina!
- Give me the plate.
- Nice frogs.
Really nice.
- Alfredo.
- I don't want them.
Eat and don't be a fool.
- They make me sick.
- Now I'll spank you!
When you're a soldier,
you'll have to eat all the ration.
Lies! Bullshits!
What did my brother say?
Regina.
- Who are those two girls?
- You ask me every night!
They're my sister
and her daughter Regina.
Alfredino... my supper.
Go, but hurry back.
He's getting worse every day.
- How long will he still live?
- Hey, he's 6 years younger than me!
And he's already dead for you!
Can you imagine if Ottavio
arrives for the funeral
and as he's the firstborn
he wants to be in command?
Ottavio is a real gentleman like me.
I wasn't born a nun!
I want to be a nun too!
- Do you want to fire a shot?
- Yes.
Put the rifle butt on your shoulder,
close your left eye,
look for the foresight.
Now look carefully.
- Do you see that family of sparrows?
- Yes.
- The black female with greedy eyes?
- Yes.
- It's your target.
- Bang! Bang!
You hit her! You stroke her!
My husband went to rack and ruin
and ran to South America
leaving me without money and
with a daughter. If I hadn't had you all...
I won't see my father anymore?
He's your new father now.
Aren't you, Giovanni?
Of course, if I don't
maintain them, who will?
But you keep calling me uncle.
- Here they are. I'll shoot Alcina!
- No, I'll shoot her.
Ready? Aim... Fire!
Good, between her eyes!
Ready? Aim... Fire!
What's happening?
I'll kill you!
What a jerk...
Go finish your dinner!
Now!
Shame on you too!
Go eat!
- Idiot!
- Aren't you ashamed at your age?
There's a gulf between us,
between me and you all!
Go on with your bullshit!
He buys machines,
while everything is going to hell.
You'll mower your butt
with that machine, Mr. Modernist!
Come on, eat!
Eat those frogs,
or you'll go to hell.
Shit face!
- Who taught you that?
- A friend of mine.
And no one will have my land,
not even a square yard of it!
You can say what you want
but your father has a thing for Ottavio.
I'm here only because I want
the land! All of it! Otherwise...
If you want to know the truth,
I've always envied Ottavio! Always!
I wish I could stay away
from this family problems!
Enjoy life! Eat up all the money
in 6 months! Have a new woman every day!
Love is an arrow
which brings my words to you...
A fucking gulf.
Poor thing.
You didn't have to force him to eat!
He's my son, and no one
can tell me how to raise him.
Alfredo!
Don't worry, when
he gets hungry he'll be back.
These aren't lice,
these are chickens!
Keep still.
You'll see, you'll look
like a nice ravish.
Don't move, stay still.
They'll never find me.
I'll leave with uncle Ottavio.
Alfredo?
Alfredo! where are you?
Get back home, Alfredo!
Hey you!
- Have you seen Alfredo?
- No.
Go to bed, bald head.
It's late.
Olmo! Olmo!
What do you want?
Come to bed, I can't sleep
when you're out at night.
If my father had been here
no one would have cut my hair.
Once I heard him call me
from the bottom of a well.
- Alfredo!
- Let's run away together!
He also called me from
an empty pumpkin: "Olmo!"
Alfredo!
And he called me
from a barrel of lambrusco wine.
Olmo!
- Alfredo?
- Olmo!
(SPEAKING DIALECT)
Hey carter, come back!
What a fool to leave a horse
in the middle of the road!
Come back at once!
Damn you!
I've not even got the strength
to give an order to a servant.
Listen... What lovely music.
Young people dance,
hug each other,
and make love before sunset.
There's no place for an old man here.
It's hot, master, isn't it?
- Who are you?
- I'm Irma, the daughter of Delina.
I've always walked barefoot,
and now my feet are swollen.
But they're nice, aren't they?
My mistress gave them to me.
Irma, follow me!
Come on!
Master?
Master?
Master?
Don't worry.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Take it.
You scared me.
- Milk her.
- It's not milking time.
She's swollen, milk her.
Cows are full
of milk and shit.
We're all cursed.
Curse is inside us.
And it gets worse with age.
Do you know what
the worst curse is?
The hail?
The hail isn't a curse.
Shit and milk in my head, that's it.
Not even war or pellagra are.
One is cursed when
it doesn't get hard anymore.
Milk and shit.
It's no use.
It doesn't want to get hard.
Put your hand inside.
Mr Alfredo,
no one can milk a bull.
Go back to dance.
- Go.
- I really can?
Yes. Go, go.
Irma, when the party's
about to be over
- tell everyone I'm dead.
- Okay.
Tell them I'm dead
but they must keep dancing.
Will you remember? Dead.
Okay.
Our master is dead.
Our master is dead!
Yes, our master is dead.
- Is it the truth?
- Who knows.
Take the water away!
Let's all get drunk!
Fill it up.
But the master
wants us to keep dancing.
He wants
to rule after death too?
Let's play!
If you could see yourself, Mr. Alfredo!
You didn't die like a master!
And why did you untie all the cows?
To make me work harder?
Maybe...
Maybe the truth is
That when someone has nothing to do
they have too much time to think.
And thinking too much
they become dotards.
At least we knew each other,
I knew you were the one who ruled.
Now it's a mess!
Who knows how everything will end.
"I, Alfredo Berlinghieri,
in possession of all my mental faculties
appoint as my sole heir
my youngest son Giovanni.
To my firstborn Ottavio
- What did he say?
- "My firstborn Ottavio".
"I leave a life annuity
of 5,000 lire,
which he'll receive
for his lifetime
from my sole heir.
Moreover, I leave him
the flat I have in town,
provided that, unmistakably,
the entire Holding Berlinghieri... "
Go back to sleep,
your granny is not well.
"... the entire Holding Berlinghieri"
Granny!
Granny's dead!
"... id est nine-hundred hectares
of cultivations and the villa,
the machinery and the tools
and all the capital
consisting of cows
horses and swine
go to my son Giovanni. "
This turban
was given to me by
a famous tiger hunter.
Uncle Ottavio, take me away with you.
Why, don't you like it here?
Everyone's mean.
Where would you like to go?
- I'd like to sail.
- On a sailing boat?
Like this one?
What are you doing?
- Put it down!
- No!
You don't have to touch the silkworms!
- I touch them because I can!
- You're a fool!
I'm your master!
The silkworms are mine,
you shouldn't come here.
- Why?
- Because I feed them. Give me that!
Why should I?
The silkworms are mine.
And the raisins.
And the mechanic rake.
And the wheat.
And the cows, and the D'Alcò's family.
And you're mine too.
- Go to hell and give me the silkworm!
- No!
Go to hell!
Go to hell!
Now you're running? Coward!
Help me, or we'll both be spanked.
I can hurt you with a finger if I want.
You make me laugh!
Here you are.
There are only a few left.
The others have already nested.
Those aren't nests but cocoons.
I've seen one in a book.
Take off those clothes,
they're all wet.
It's so light... Butterflies
come out of this hole.
I've never seen them.
Like my little sister. She was born
at night, then she flew away.
- Why did she fly away?
- Because she died.
When you die you don't fly away.
They just put you in the ground.
Doesn't it hurt?
Hurt?
- It seems hard.
- Show me yours.
It looks like a worm.
If you pull it, it'll become like mine.
- It doesn't.
- Pull harder.
It hurts.
The worse for you. If you aren't
brave you aren't a socialist.
- What does it mean?
- I'm a socialist with holes in his pocket.
A socialist with holes in his pocket?
Never mind. You don't understand anything.
- Come on, take this mantle.
- I don't want it!
Don't act like a child!
It stopped hailing.
Come and see!
- What's that?
- It's the town.
That cannot be. It's too far away.
It's the town, I swear on God.
That's the Cathedral, I went there
with uncle Ottavio when I was small.
- What tall houses!
- Those aren't houses, those are bell towers.
One of them is smoking!
- That's a factory!
- Who knows if they can see us too.
- Dad! We saw the town! It was big!
- Later.
Mr. Giovanni,
I don't remember another storm
like this one since I got married.
Call the men, and the labourers!
Make them come here!
- Orso!
- Orso!
- Duro!
- Duro!
- Ceso!
- Ceso!
- Oreste!
- Oreste!
- Moretto!
- Moretto!
- Vecio!
- Vecio!
- Bestione! Montanaro!
- Bestione, Montanaro!
Follow me, everyone!
To cut it short,
we lost everything.
Wine, tomatoes, potatoes,
grain, the whole harvest.
Therefore we must
all make sacrifices.
Don't we, Leo?
So? The cat stole your tongue?
Tell them how much wheat we lost.
- Half as much?
- At least.
Therefore it's simple. We
must live with half wage.
But when the harvest is double
we don't get double wage.
To be honest, if I had to
act out of my own interest,
I should send you all home,
especially you labourers!
You're a bunch of ignorants,
you should be grateful to me!
Because the only one
who's really losing here is me!
And by the way, who's the master?
Who rules here?
You.
We lost everything, didn't you hear me?
And you have big ears too!
(SPEAKING DIALECT)
Let's get inside.
Did you get hurt?
Yes.
- I got hurt working.
- Poor thing.
Dad, there's no more polenta.
Dad, I'm still hungry.
I'll make you forget you're hungry.
- Mr. Abele?
- Yes.
- News from the League!
- What do they say?
They said we gotta make a move,
they're preparing a strike.
- Where?
- Everywhere!
What's the matter then?
We all agree.
We'll go on strike.
Strike?
Do you know what strike means?
I asked you if you know
what it means.
It means I'll no longer
use these hands to work.
Good. He's right.
They won't sow, they
won't harvest the wheat.
They won't milk,
and so no more milk!
Everyone stands still,
and in the meantime the land
dies! Are you ready for that?
Yes. There's the League now.
The League?
What's this League?
Did the League tell you
we'll end up eating grass?
And that we'll all get
mean? But really mean!
- Did they tell you this?
- Yes, the League is great and strong!
You want to know
what the League is?
Strike! Strike!
- Strike!
- Strike! - Strike!
I like this song.
Strike!
Poor things, they haven't
been milked for two days.
So? Are the maids on strike too?
Desolina, today you'll go
to the village to get some milk.
And don't stop talking to anyone!
That's crazy! We have to buy the milk
when the stable's full of cows!
Strikes are intolerably arrogant!
They're against civil principles.
Those people aren't reasonable,
the old man included!
They'll have to give up.
And cows will explode
and wheat will rot in the fields.
You, eat!
Listen:
"Negotiations between
the Trade Union and
the Agrarian Association
have fallen through.
We'll send lancers
to the sites on strike.
We'll reply to boycotts
boycotting the League. "
Stop it.
This is the Official Report!
"We'll reply to the strike with a lock-out.
We'll reply to violence with violence.
The whip is necessary against
subverting beastly instincts. "
Granddad, who are the strike-breakers?
They're dogs who go
to work when the strike's on.
Why don't they like the strike?
Because they're poorer
and more ignorant than us.
Granny, listen to the music!
I'm coming!
Lawyer you are here too?
Good morning Reverend.
Look!
Look how Mr Giovanni's running!
Basetti works sitting, poor thing!
That one is Campanini!
There's the lawyer, and that
child with pigtails is his daughter.
- All strike-breakers?
- All masters!
They're ridiculous!
Olmo!
Olmo!
Come here!
Is that Socialism?
The rich who sweat and
the poor who sit under a tree
doing nothing?
Too good to last.
- You're lucky, Olmo D'Alcò.
- Why?
Why?
It took me 73 years
to see masters work.
Here, finish this trap for moles.
Olmo.
Get some leaves,
fan me a little, will you?
The weather's going to change.
Will you teach me to build traps?
Shut up or you'll wake up granny.
How can he sleep with open eyes?
He can do many things.
Once he saw Garibaldi!
Careful, if they catch you
with me they'll spank you.
They won't. They know I'm a Socialist too.
Come and see!
Now it looks like yours!
- What did you do?
- I pulled it.
Liar! You did this.
- I'll teach you something.
- I know it. I'm a Socialist too.
What's that dust cloud?
- Those are the children of the Bassa.
- Where are they going?
- They're coming to Genova with us.
- To plant onions?
No, they were sent here
after 3 months of strike.
They've nothing left to eat, so
the Red Aid prepared a train
to Genova. Long live
the children of the Bassa!
- What are you going to tell them?
- Wait, let me think carefully.
The reformists want to give you
10 more cents per hour.
Do they?
Ten cents more per hour
multiplied 18 working hours
makes about a million and a half!
- Go drown in the channel!
- Be careful, you'll break my neck's BONDS.
The revolutionaries say the land
must go to those who cultivate it
and that there have to be
no slaves or masters. Understand?
Yes I studied EYE-TALIAN!
Italian!
- I read it in the VACABULARY too.
- Vocabulary!
- I made up my mind!
- What?
I will say: long live the revolution!
Long live the revolutionaries!
Long live the general strike!
Hurray!
Sandrone, look who's
coming here. An officer.
What's going to happen now?
- Let's teach him a lesson. Fetch a bat.
- Yes!
Let's see what they can really do.
What happened? We found you!
We'll take you to prison!
- Enough now!
- Clear out!
Away!
Come on kids!
Aren't you ashamed
of getting angry with children?
Clear the square!
You're all corrupt! Go home!
Olmo!
Olmo, your bag!
Olmo! Olmo!
I'm not a coward Olmo.
I'm not a coward.
That's my house!
Look! Look!
Look at them! They're a disgrace to Italy!
Deserters, traitors!
They look like criminals!
They should be executed!
Tura! Tura!
Olmo, did they catch you too?
They're going to kill all of us!
Damned be the king!
The hell with everyone!
Olmo! Olmo!
Regina, go away.
Away! And change
your clothes, was is over!
- Yes, Lieutenant!
- Close the door!
Old fart!
Son of a gun!
Celso!
Armida!
I don't know what's
wrong with me, father,
But I can't set my mind at rest
unless I find the three love oranges.
Let me go and seek them.
The king said it was just a whim,
but seeing him so thoughtful all the time... "
And? Keep reading!
Anita, why did you stop reading?
- You must be Olmo.
- I am.
Who are you?
Anita. Anita Furlan.
Venetian?
- From Verona.
- Verona?
We set a camp in Verona.
Are you a refugee?
Yes.
I lost my family.
Go now.
It must be heavy.
- Anita, how does the tale ends?
- Go ahead!
- Please!
- Alright.
At-tention!
- Yes sir!
- Stand at ease!
Dotard! You don't recognise
your friends? It's me, bonehead!
Lieutenant, I'll demote you!
War is over,
no one can give us orders now.
Now I like you!
Really? Then kiss me, my hero!
No one took care of your silkworms.
There's only mice in here now.
Like in the trenches.
Remember when we could see the town
from here but no one believed us?
It seemed so close!
Could you see
the war from here too?
Master of the house,
may you rest in peace.
Go to hell with your father,
your mother, etcetera. Amen.
Olmo, put it back. That's not ours.
Wasn't it half-and-half?
Olmo, when you were away
many things changed.
We've always been
paid half harvest.
The Master had to rent machines
and pay new labourers.
- So what?
- It's been a bad year.
Long live our hero!
Even half harvest would be a theft,
because we're the ones who work!
You don't even want to go fifty-fifty?
Wanna know why I had
to hire so many labourers?
Because you all went to die at war,
- like idiots.
- Dad, you have no right to say that!
Shut up and play with
tin soldiers if you wish.
Wanna know how much it cost me
to keep you at home?
How much?
More than what you're worth.
I wanted to go too, but you stopped me!
Sure...
That's a beautiful sword.
Indeed it is.
It's sharp too, very sharp.
Look, dad!
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Is that all you can do?
When I was your age I got up
at 4 a. m. to check the stables.
You all shouldn't forget that!
I was the first to get up
in threshing times,
and I was the last to go to sleep.
Try to deny it!
Deny it if you can!
- You're so good, little cousin.
- Thanks, I can do better.
...to widen the farm.
These are no longer values!
Respectability, devotion
to the Church, love for the land,
loyalty to one's family
and faith into the banks!
Calm down please.
And respect!
Respect! Respect! Respect!
What the master means is
that there was no one left to work here,
so he had to rent new machines
which he paid grain for,
as he does with you all.
Machines which make life easier.
They're a change,
they mean progress.
They're great.
Don't you agree?
It's heavy, isn't it?
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop it!
Stop it! The Army
didn't teach you anything?
- Who's that?
- Attila Melanchini, my dad's new farmer.
I'm a soldier like you.
You heard the master.
He gave you all what he could.
From now on we'll work together.
By the way I understand you.
No, Olmo! Olmo!
Enough.
Women, did you hear the master?
It's our men's fault,
because they went to die in war.
It's the labourers' fault too
because they work,
and want to be paid for it.
It's our fault, because we get hungry
and catch pellagra!
And it's also our fault if
2 out of 3 of our kids die!
The master won't be ruined
if we take some more of our grain
and leave the rest to him.
Come on, help yourselves.
- You speak too well to be a peasant.
- I'm a teacher.
You're the first educated
girlfriend I've ever had.
Excuse me, teacher.
Are you done with your lesson?
Here comes the rooster!
Peck this!
Peep peep peep!
Enough! Stop it!
Alright then.
What happened?
Where are you going?
To celebrate Saint Martin.
It's November 11th.
We were evicted.
Farmers always take advantage!
They evicted us before
the expiry of our contracts.
- We're in the League.
- The vintage is over.
The master asked me for
something shameful..
Now they even want our wives.
The coward...
Oreste, you stubborn ass,
go away, it's useless!
My contract expires in a year.
Not even the Army will make me leave.
Oreste! Oreste!
Oreste!
Go away!
The riding devils will come
and take away everything!
Not even the Pope! Not even
Jesus Christ will make me leave!
I've lived here for 40 years!
I'm pissed off!
(SPEAKS DIALECT)
I'll go to Rome and protest
in my underpants!
- Get lost, cowards!
- Go and tear the soil!
Learn what that means!
It was about time for them to arrive!
They'll feed the donkeys.
I like it!
I'm about to come!
You make me come!
Come... Not even an elephant
could make you come.
I need a real man!
In the name of the law,
away from the house.
Should my kids sleep under a bridge?
They'll sleep in a prison
if you don't leave.
Why don't you arrest those masters
who don't respect contracts?
- In the name of the law...
- Which law?
The law is on our side, because
our contracts will expire next year.
Masters want to steal
a working year from us!
They're sending us away!
Come down, we need you too!
Come on, women, or this'll be the last
Saint Martin's day we celebrate!
The law is always
on the masters' side!
They're always protected!
Don't go away!
Get down! Stay with us!
Don't let them pass!
Stop! They want to evict Oreste!
- Let's help him!
- Let's surround his house!
Get off the carts!
Patrol turn left!
Patrol, stop!
The royal guards will make
them remember this feast forever.
Swords ready!
- Come with me, let's go get some poles!
- The poles, quick!
All together!
We're women,
we aren't scared!
Because we love our children,
because we love our children.
We're women,
we aren't scared,
Because we love our children,
we'll defend the League!
Oilì, oilà,
the League will grow
together with us Socialists,
together with us Socialists.
Oilì, oilà,
the League will grow
Socialists
only want freedom.
There's no freedom
because we aren't united...
You'll have to kill all of us
to pass through here!
Even if we're women,
we aren't scared.
Because we our tongues,
because we have our tongues.
Even if we're women,
we aren't scared...
Good boys, show them that
no one can touch the estate!
The estate is inviolable!
Stop the charge!
Platoon, retreat!
(SONG IN DIALECT)
How embarrassing!
Shame on you!
That's how you all defend us!
Bunch of maintained cowards!
Idlers!
I'll throw you out! Delinquents!
Criminals! Bolshevists!
You want to make war
all alone?
(SONG IN DIALECT)
- I'm all untidy!
- Everyone's in, and they want to meet you.
What are you waiting for?
It's a good chance for you.
You say we should act like in Rivarolo,
but someone got killed there,
and now the Reds
have their own martyr
and he'll be even erected
a monument in the square. So I say...
You're talking crap, Pioppi!
You're too good.
In Rivarolo a mistake was made:
Only one was killed.
My dog won't listen
if I hit him once or twice,
but if I hit him ten times he'll learn!
Can I speak?
In this Church we were all christened,
and confirmed.
We all got married here too,
and we'll have to enter
this Church in a coffin, one day.
As late as possible, I hope.
You all know what a Crusade is.
Don't you?
Young gentleman, this
should interest you as well.
You forced me to come.
Why don't you leave me be?
The Church,
even the Church
used force, when needed.
Who are these Bolshevists, after all?
Half-Asians, that's what they are.
Like the Saracens.
subversive Mongolians,
who'll kill all of us sooner or later!
And will also take what belongs to us!
Am I wrong?
Am I wrong?
Am I, Pioppi?
This is just crap!
We should kill all of them!
We don't want violence or
revenge. We want order.
We're the new Crusaders.
We must give courage to young people.
They're just waiting for a sign from us.
Let's give them that sign then.
Go! Go!
We already saved our country once.
We were in the trenches
while today we're here.
It's fair enough, new enterprises
need money.
Solidariety!
Italy needs incentives.
Not even a bastard son
would have done that.
There's much to do in town as well.
Imagine my father's expression
if he saw me with you.
You father...
"Respect! Respect! Respect!"
He's just a thief who looks
for respect, like every master.
When I become master
I'll be much worse than him.
And I'll kill you!
You should meet uncle Ottavio.
You'd like him, he sees it our way.
I know this music!
I know what it is!
Montanaro! I'm D'Alcò!
Do you remember me?
Bald head! Little bastard,
let me look at you!
How much polenta we ate together!
Olmo!
Wait for me,
I'll be right back.
- Let's help this girl.
- You shouldn't bother...
Do you remember Montanaro?
I'll be right back!
- We're twins, you know...
- You're kidding me.
It's the truth!
We share everything.
What's his is mine,
and what's mine is mine too.
- Hi Elide.
- Hi.
- Hello madam.
- Hello gentlemen.
- Nicoletta, where are you going?
- Downstairs.
- Full service.
- Thank you.
Home-made rosolio!
I haven't had it for ages.
- Would you like some?
- Sure, but I will pay for it.
I want to pay for it very well.
Take this money too.
I always pay well.
And this.
- Go to hell, you and your money!
- Why? She's happy.
- Drink with us.
- I can't, it makes me sick.
If you don't want to drink,
then get undressed.
- See? I knew she was a whore.
- She isn't, she needs money.
If she wasn't a whore
she wouldn't accept my money.
Your money make a whore of her.
However she cleaned me up.
Don't you get undressed too?
- You go first.
- I'll go after you.
- I insist!
- No, you paid, it's your turn.
- I'm cold.
- I'm shaking.
You're older!
- Who should come first?
- Both of you.
- Both of us?
- Yes, It'll be quicker.
You know,
I lay on the railway too.
- What?
- Remember the Red Aid's train?
That day I lay on the railway
and you passed over me.
Who starts?
Your friend is a little...
Maybe you're better than me.
Do you have a girlfriend?
- What do you want?
- I was thinking of lovely Anita.
- Leave Anita be!
- Is she your girlfriend?
- Drink a little.
- No thanks, it makes me feel strange.
That's good, we'll have more fun.
Good girl.
- Will you marry her?
- She's already my wife.
But we aren't married,
she's my companion.
No weddings, they're bolshevists.
Free love, understand?
Did your hand get tired?
You know what free love
means, don't you?
- Don't ask me difficult questions.
- Answer!
Hands off!
- I know nothing, I'm not educated.
- Are you kidding me, whore?
You know what free love means.
I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed.
Please, go away.
Please go.
Please.
Leave!
My God!
- She's epileptic!
- What?
Let's go! Away!
Look for someone!
Madam!
Don't shake like that, calm down!
Please, enough now.
- We didn't do anything.
- Let go of her.
And you know you shouldn't drink...
- Should I call a doctor?
- It's no use.
We can only wait.
Alfredo!
Uncle Ottavio!
It's me, Alfredo!
Is anybody in?
- Hello?
- Who's that?
- Hello. Sorry to give you trouble...
- Ottavio isn't in.
- I'll return some other time then.
- Have you got a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.
- Good news.
- Who are you?
- I'm Ada and I need a cigarette.
I'm Alfredo and I need my uncle.
- A cigar?
- My saviour!
Not at all...
- Uncle Ottavio.
- What brings you here?
It's been a bad day.
I came to town to have some fun
and found an epileptic girl.
Have you ever seen one?
- Could I have a bath here?
- Of course.
Come here.
Put it there.
I spent the whole morning
at the auction's.
To search for beauty is tiring.
Poor thing, you work like a slave...
Have a look. It's beautiful,
but of course no one liked it.
A German painter made it.
I have discovered him.
- What's he doing, in your opinion?
- He's sleeping.
- No, he's dead.
- I think he's sleeping.
He's dead.
- Look at his hand.
- He seems dead but he's sleeping.
- I fell in love.
- Again?
Yes but this time I'm serious.
- Let me guess: Itala?
- Bugatti.
- Sedan?
- Torpedo.
But my love is hopeless.
It's too expensive.
- I'll buy one tomorrow.
- Can you drive?
Sure... well no...
but it's easy to learn.
Your nephew is a liar.
Very good, have no mercy!
Make my stingy brother
spend a lot of money!
- How's your mother?
- She paints all the time.
"Foggy plains of the Bassa".
The lands I lost.
Ottavio, can I borrow the car?
- I'll take the baby home.
- The baby's ready!
"Broom, roar, first, second, third.
hear the audacious gear!"
The fourth is unkind,
grey and bureaucratic.
Do you like it?
Nice. A bit modern, maybe.
Modern? Ignorant,
it's a futurist poem.
Read the other one.
"What you gave me that night,
gipsy, I'll miss:
your perjurer's smile and a kiss".
I like it!
I really do, what a pity it's so short.
- That's why it's nice.
- What are you doing?
- We both read them, we spoiled them.
- And so you throw them away?
Why aren't they letting us pass?
Beasts!
- Pretty lady!
- Would you like to pass?
I want to pass.
- Attila, look!
- Go ahead!
Pass now.
It's the right time
for overtaking.
Go!
- Pass, sissy!
- Are those cheeky faces your friends?
No. Who knows where
those loonies are going.
They make me sick.
I don't want to see them.
I don't want to see
anything. I'm blind!
What are you doing?
Look ahead!
I can't drive!
We'll end up in a ditch!
I don't wanna look!
I can't see! I'm blind!
I'm blind! Blind!
...youth
of
the world.
Pietro, read in a loud voice
what you wrote
"Communism is
the youth of the world"
Olmo, can you tell us
what it means?
What it means?
It means...
- Teacher!
- Comrade.
Miss comrade.
I'm 71, but in bed I'm like a boy
because I'm a communist.
You rascal! We're here
to learn, not to brag.
That's enough for today.
We'll guard the common house.
And we'll do homework with this bottle.
Shall we go?
It's been a long day.
I went to town with Alfredo and...
- Have a look...
- We didn't go there to have fun.
It came out well, didn't it?
We walked.
We drank a little...
You know, the usual
things you do in town.
I know
Yes.
What students you have!
The youngest of them is at least 80!
They're staying
at the hayloft, so I...
You're wasting your time with
that bunch of oldies. What s it for?
In fact I wish I'd gone
to dance, but you weren't here.
You wanted to dance
with that big belly?
Anita!
Don't!
Anita, don't!
- I feel better now.
- Me too.
Nine!
Five! Seven!
Six! Five! Seven!
What's in your mind?
What?
- Do you have another woman?
- No.
- No?
- No, I don't.
I don't.
Let's dance.
- Have you ever danced in a hayloft?
- No, this is my first time.
Wait I'll get something to drink.
- Thanks. I'll pay later.
- Sure.
Alfredo!
Alfredo, where are you?
Alfredo!
Don't leave me alone!
Alfredo!
It's alright. I'm blind, I cannot see.
It's a beautiful song,
don't stop playing because of me...
Let the music play!
Faster! Faster!
Faster!
It's so cool!
Make me fly!
- What a pity, she's got beautiful eyes.
- Indeed.
Alfredo, give me a kiss.
- Want some wine?
- No.
Come on, drink!
I need to drink,
so you should as well. Right?
She's blind, right?
You aren't Alfredo!
Who are you?
Shame on you!
you have no pity on a poor blind!
Monster!
Careful.
- Alfredo.
- Enough with this game.
- Don't leave me alone anymore.
- Stop it!
- You're cruel.
- Don't tell me off.
He's Olmo, my best friend.
She's Anita...
She's Ada.
Anita meet Ada.
It's beautiful!
- Beautiful!
- So soft!
First an epileptic, then a blind girl...
If you keep on like this
you'll have to open a Hospital.
You're the blind one here.
Is it ready?
And so you're blind, right?
Thanks, you saved me. I thought
I'd be forced to go on all night.
You came here all dressed up
and perfumed to make fun of us?
How do you call us?
Yokels? Boors?
You're right,
I do it often.
There comes a time
when I can't help myself.
So I close my eyes and start
knocking against people.
Open them up, instead!
What do you see?
What do you see?
She sees that I'm happy.
We mustn't change,
we must always remain the same.
Give me your hands,
all of you!
Can you feel what I feel?
Let's remember this moment
when we'll be apart.
Look!
That's awful!
I'm sorry, I apologise to everyone.
Mine was a stupid joke.
- I'm sorry.
- Please pass.
I'm sorry, I didn't want
to offend anyone.
I'm not blind!
I'm not blind! Forgive me!
Look, I can see you!
I can see all of you!
But is she drunk or...
She's not drunk, she's fantastic.
She smokes, she can drive
and writes poetry.
She's so modern.
You can't understand.
You cant!
You're a peasant!
- Come here everyone!
- Why don't you listen to me?
- Careful.
- Come!
Quickly!
Fascist! Cowards!
I'll kill all of you!
What's wrong? Look...
Who are you? You don't know me!
What do you want from me?
You're bothering me.
My name's Ada Chiostri Polan.
I'm 21, the worst age.
My dad is the one who drew
the King's head on the 10 lire's bills,
We were surrounded by money
without possessing any.
I'm an orphan. Three years
ago my parents organised
and expedition for millionaires.
The never returned from Mount Blank.
They died as they lived:
beyond their possibilities.
I have no sisters or brothers,
I can go anywhere
and live with anyone.
- What happened?
- The common house's on fire!
It's a shame!
Please don't.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Come here.
Kiss me.
Why didn't you tell me
you were a virgin?
You wouldn't have believed me.
That's right.
Then you aren't my uncle's lover.
Who, me?
I'm not.
Wake up!
Pietro Pecorai, 78.
- Wake up!
- Sharecropper.
Wake up!
Exploited by masters,
murdered by the Fascist.
- Wake up!
- Decimo Monatti, 74,
day labourer since he was 8!
Exploited by masters,
murdered by the Fascist.
- Wake up!
- Giosuè Zuelli, 72.
- Wake up!
- Day labourer since he was 7!
Exploited by masters,
murdered by the Fascist.
Wake up!
Open up your windows and look!
Wake up!
Come to see!
- Wake up!
- Wake up!
- Wake up!
- Wake up!
Look. Nobody came.
It's useless.
It's the end. It's the end!
It isn't!
We're strong!
We're many,
we're united!
They'll kill us all!
They'll kill us all!
Listen!
Can't you hear them?
They're coming!
Listen, they're coming!
There, look.
- I feel sick.
- Because of the baby?
You're a baby...
It's too early for that.
It's over.
Did you see?
They're all their relatives.
There's at least a thousand of them!
There are at least
2,000 communists outside!
Baroni, look like you've been to a funeral.
Do you feel sorry?
You think you were wrong?
No regrets! No fear!
All we have
to fear is ourselves.
Should I fold it a little?
You'll look more elegant.
I don't want to be elegant.
I want to be strong!
It's not only a shirt!
It's a symbol!
You're actually sewing a flag!
Am I wrong, Baroni?
More macho?
Good, not better looking,
but more macho!
You'll have a black shirt too,
and you'll wear it till you die!
Gimme the cat.
Communists are cunning.
They play on your feelings,
like this cute kitten
which can move you all.
Communism is an epidemic
which can destroy the world.
Follow me.
Let's pretend that this kitten
suffers from communism.
You don't have to worry for him,
You have to protect
all the other cats in the world.
Preserve them from epidemics.
Look at this cat and think:
That's not a cat,
that's a communist.
And you must destroy him!
To arms!
To arms!
To arms, we're Fascist,
the terror of Communists
and to balance things,
we're even more popular.
We're members
of the Fascist Party,
we'll defend
our cause till death...
- What shall we do to communists?
- Kick their asses!
- And to those from the League?
- Kick their asses!
