Welcome back
Dear listeners
we were with tonight's news
and we'll give you
now the breaking news
lt's been 29 years to the peace
treaties between Egypt and Israel
According to the security
services reports of the last 10 years
25 Israeli spying
agencies were arrested in Egypt
And the number of spies recruited
by the Mossad in the past 15 years
reached 64 spies
Therefore, we're asking
will the Israeli Arabic struggle end?
Or will it continue forever?
Ladies and gentlemen
that's it for today's news
Live from the studio
you were with Mustafa Abdul Rahman
Farewell, this is the Cairo radio
Yes sir? Right away
We received some Intel that Levi and
her people will be leaving the country today
Therefore, we received
directives to move quickly
The plan is set, the Swat Team
is surrounding the house right now
You will indeed break
into the house with them
But we must make sure to get
Levi out in one piece, is that clear?
This is your responsibility Mustafa
Give it up Levi
the house is totally surrounded
Give up, it's no use
- You'll let me die?
- l'd have loved to
But unfortunately
they need you alive
Come up before
l change my mind, come up
Come up, come up
Hello?
- How is your wife doing?
- She's still in shock
She's not eating or drinking
She's locking herself
in the children's room
You must be able to control her
She's in a nightmare right now
And she'd do anything
to bring it to an end
You must tell her that if she did
anything wrong, she'll pay for it
And the consequences will be terrible
Don't worry Yusha
We've just been here for 3 days
lt's just a matter of time
l know what to do
Listen up Daniel
l agreed to let you bring her here
But l would never let you harm me
and harm the country, is that clear?
Please Yusha
l think you're not being objective
l know you like him
because he's an eastern Jewish
What the hell are you talking about?
Didn't you hear what l told him?
l didn't get to where l am now
if it weren't for my loyalty to Israel
Excuse me, excuse me, l apologize
Sarah, Yusef
Sarah, Yusef
Kids, Sarah
Where are my kids?
Where did you take them?
- Good morning sweetie
- Answer me, where did you take them?
No need to worry
they're my kids too
- Then bring them here
- Once l feel you're calm enough to talk
Talk about what? About what?
What you're doing won't help
you and it won't lead you anywhere
And where will what
you're doing lead you?
- Don't you want to eat? Aren't you hungry?
- l don't want to eat anything
So you're in a strike?
l know that what happened
was hard but we must get over it
- And move on with our lives normally
- Normally?
What's between us would never be
normal, are you out of your mind?
No, l'm not mad, l'm your husband
And you're my wife
and the mother of my kids
And that will never change
l don't know you
my kids are from another man
And that man could
very well have disappeared, died
or maybe he never existed and
l know how to move on with my life
l won't be the first or the last
woman to lose her husband
Just give me back my kids
and send me back to Egypt
and forget me, l'll never talk
about you or speak ill of you
l swear to God
l'll never speak ill of you
No Salwa, no sweetie
This is my country
and we'll live here together
l'm not saying that l want you
to accept this right away and act normally
No, you must rehabilitate yourself
So you won't wake up
to find yourself dreaming
No, this is the reality
Look out of the window
Salwa, look at this country
lt's a developed and civilized
country, with clean people
No tra_icjam and no pollution
Consider we went to live in
a European country or we took a trip
- Isn't that what we wanted to do?
- You know what you are?
- You're a traitor, a spy
- A traitor?
l'm a national hero, l served
my country Israel and it's an honor
And when my kids grow up here in their
country, they'll look at me as a role model
Come over here, give me back
my kids or l'll kill you right here
- Calm down honey
- Let go of me you son of a bitch
Who do you think you are?
You think l can't restrain you?
l can kill you in a second
- Do it, just do it and save me
- No, you and your kids will live with me
against your will and if you don't like it
l'll ship you back to Egypt all alone
But then, come what may
you would never see your kids again
Go ahead, go ahead
if you want to leave, do it alone
The hell with you, the door
is wide enough for you to leave
Good morning
What is it guys? Let God be
your guide and despise the devil
We can hear you shouting from the end of
the street, what would people say about us?
Be gentle with her
and you must have upset him
Excuse me, l don't mean to intervene
l didn't introduce myself?
l'm Rashel your next door neighbor
Come here honey, come, come
go change your clothes and wash your face
Don't be scared
your kids are in my house
Don't be surprised that
l can talk Egyptian fluently
l'm of Jewish Egyptian origins
But l lived here and l grew up here
l'm so happy
that we'll become neighbors
- Where are my kids?
- Inside honey, come, come
Come on in
Don't be scared
it's Benhas my husband
He was shot during
the Lebanese war, the hell with wars
But here, he gets
paid a huge salary
Thank God
we're not in another state
coz the likes of him
would have been treated poorly
Come here, come, hey kids
- Sarah, Yusef
- Mom
Mom, mom, l want
a paper and a pen to draw
Let me show you around and
we can buy her whatever she wants
Alright
Look, this region
is called the Batyan street
All residents of this area are party
members, army o_icers, engineers
What's great about this region
is that it's so close to the sea
ln the summer, l'll take you there
we'll have fun and waddle
You'll be so happy
l noticed your girl
is coughing, is she allergic?
But l can still eat chocolate
May God protect them
By the way
don't worry about the schools
By the end of this street
there's a very nice school
The school owners are my friends
and all my female
friends send their kids there
We'd fill an application
to send them there
You'll be very happy about it
Okay
They must send us all around
to go park in the parking lot
But it's okay, l understand them
Last month, a man parked his car
like this with a bag full of explosives
He wanted to put them into
the supermarket and blow it up
l don't know why
we get all this shit
We're living in a safe country yet
we're always having all kinds of trouble
lt's alright honey get o_ with the kids
and l'll be right there, l won't be late
- Mom, where are we going?
- We're hopefully leaving honey
we're leaving
The Egyptian embassy please
The Egyptian
embassy, where? Where?
Dear lord, dear lord
- Mom, l'm tired
- It's alright Yusef, walk a bit more
l can't
Excuse me, wait up please
Excuse me
excuse me please, please
Stay right here, don't you move
Excuse me, it seems
to me you speak Arabic, right?
- _es
- Alright
l'm Egyptian and
l want to go back to Egypt
- Can you help me?
- May God help you
No, l don't need any money
Listen, just tell me
how to get to the Egyptian embassy
- l don't know
- Just wait
l don't know anyone here
you're the only one who speaks Arabic
My husband kidnapped me
and brought me here against my will
And he turned out
to be an Israeli o_icer
He's working for the Mossad
and his name is even Daniel
May God help you
may God help you, keep away, keep away
- Don't take me there, just tell me where it is
- Move away
- Please wait up
- Move away
You're coming with us or
should l take the kids and leave?
The file that's in your hands includes
a detailed report of the last mission
The most important information
we have is that we retrieved all the numbers
o_ Levi's phone while trying to leave
including the number of
an employee working in a foreign bank
called Ezzat Abdul Hamid
Unfortunately, he managed to run
away moments before we caught him
And notjust him
along with his wife and kids
ln the last couple of days
we received very strange Intel from Israel
An Arabic merchant of the 1948
went to the Egyptian embassy
and said that while walking on the streets
an Egyptian lady followed him with her kids
And she asked him to take
her to the Egyptian embassy
because her husband had kidnapped him
and brought her to Israel against her will
after realizing he was an Israeli
Mossad o_icer and his name is Daniel
When we compared
the descriptions of this lady and her kids
to those of the disappeared man
it turned out that they are the same
Come here Mustapha
l brought you some tea
- Tea? Yes sir?
- This is brigadier general Sabri
leader of the group
who laid the plan of action
and he assured me that
you're the best to do this mission
lndeed sir, you carried out plenty
of successful missions outside Egypt
and you understand
the Israeli society very well
You speak their language
as if you're one of them
- So l'm required to go to Israel
- To get the information we want from you
And most importantly, we want you
to bring Salwa and the kids back
- Me? Alone?
- That's true
And bring back Salwa who's under
the surveillance of all the Mossad agents?
Of course
- What? Do you have any objections?
- No, not at all sir
There's no time to waste
we must start immediately
Daniel Lavon, his father is an Iraqi Jewish
and his mother is an Egyptian Jew
He contributed to finishing o_ a big
number of Palestinian and Arabic leaders
and foreign figures sympathizing
with the Palestinian cause
Most of which were dealt with as
if they were natural death or murders
When do you expect
from the network you founded in Egypt
to start conveying information?
We started receiving
the first message two hours ago
And this is mentioned in the report
lts impact will be much bigger than all the
wars waged by Egypt in the past 100 years
So if this network was related
to influential and authority figures
they could bring down
the country's economy
What makes you think
it's in Israel's interest?
lt's indeed not in Egypt's interest
But Egypt is a friendly state
and we're not enemies
You can say that
on TV or in the press
But in fact, Egypt is the most
dangerous Arabic state to us
And we should
always beware of that fact
Daniel, nobody here's
underestimating your e_orts
We charged you with this mission
and we're most aware of its goals
And you've spent two years in Egypt
And we want to know your viewpoint
l think it's just the beginning
And we still need
other spying networks
And if we have the ability to cause
endless trouble to the Egyptian people
this is what we should b e doing
And his wife
why did he take her with him?
He could have left her
here and just take the kids
l don't know and l don't think any
Mossad member know the answer to that
Only Daniel
can answer that question
l refuse to answer that question
lt's a personal matter
lt has nothing to do with the Mossad
The Mossad has to do with everything
Salwa is the perfect camouflage
to a person like Daniel
She's an orphan
Her father died
when she was 2 years old
And her mother died a year after that
Salwa left the country
to live with her aunt in Zaraziq
and when
she grew up, they left to Iraq
You can find her photo in that file
Daniel was living
in the flat next door in Baghdad
Of course, they met by chance
He convinced her that he fell
in love and they got married
Exactly
And when her aunt's husband died
he went back to Egypt with them 2 years ago
Based on our investigations
Salwa's daughter is allergic
The closest drugstore to their house
is owned by a Jew of Egyptian
origins called Victor Hamos
You'll work in that pharmacy
to be able to meet Salwa naturally
And who'll take me there sir?
The Anfar contractor is working in
the Separation Wall, his name is Abu-Ziad
After 7 years of marriage
she has no one else in her life
l'm scared she'd accept
the reality and agree to live with him
This is why you must be sure Mustafa before
getting close to her that she didn't give in
for in that case, it would be
impossible to recruit her
You'll leave Jordan to the Israeli borders
From there, you'll find the guide
who'll take you to the Separation Wall
There, you'll meet Abu-Ziad
Reading Torah paragraphs
about the Jews' exodus from Egypt
Happy Passover
Why don't you come
and sit with us outside?
- No thank you
- Anyway, happy holiday to you
Today's Passover day, during which
we celebrate our exodus from Egypt
back in the days
of our Prophet Moses
Excuse us Ma'am, we have been introduced
properly and we didn't welcome you
l'm Yusha, Daniel's boss
and this is my wife Serena
You like the house?
And did you bring your clothes?
By the way, l invited Daniel
to a wedding next Sunday
You must come with him
Of course, from now on
we'll be like a family
l know you've been
into some tough days
But believe me, Ma'am
Daniel is one of a kind, l brought him up
By the way, l brought you a gift
But l was waiting for things to calm
down a bit before handing it over to you
There you go
The Holy Koran
We'll be waiting for you next Sunday
Let's go Ma'am
May God bless you
and make you happy Daniel
And hopefully
if l lived long enough
l'll be in charge of your son's Bat Mitzvah
when he becomes 12 years old
- Really?
- Yes Daniel
l know that his mother's non-Jewish
But l'll speak with
the High Rabbinism
And l'm sure they won't refuse to let him
convert to the faith of his father the hero
- Thank you very much
- May God bless you
Be silent and listen up, we'll go to
the village and tear down the houses
They want to continue the wall
construction, l don't want any trouble
All those l choose will come
with me and the rest will stay here
Or else l'll shoot you down
You, you
- Me, me
- Come
- Good morning
- Good morning to you
- You're Egyptian
- Hopefully
Egyptian? And what
are you coming here for?
To earn a living
ln this whole wide world, you found
no other place to earn a living but here?
And why didn't you
go somewhere else to work?
Why should l go somewhere else?
This is our land and country
and we're more worthy of it
- Salim, cut it out
- Shut up you
There's plenty of work
and nobody is taking anything from you
But you and the likes of
you are cutting down our wages
Egypt didn't contend
with betraying the whole cause
Now it's sending us dirty rascals
to share our food and work
- Salim
- And what work are you going to do?
You're going to liberate Palestine?
You're going to build
the Separation Wall with Israel
You didn'tjust sell the land
you brought its disgrace
You're really impolite
Stop the truck, stop
l swear to God
if l hear you shouting again
l'll shoot you and
throw you out here to be dog food
Tell them to cease fire
Where to?
Take, we have some work to do
don't waste the time, come on
- You were spying on me too or what?
- l know l deceived you
And you have all the right to be
mad, to throw a fit and hate me
But l never lied to you about
my feelings, they were true
And they weren't a means to an end
Haven't you asked yourself why
l brought you here with me?
l could have very simply taken
the kids and left you in Egypt
And they wanted me
to do that but l couldn't do it
l went against all the orders
and l might have risked my life too
- Because l need you
- What do you need me for?
You're my wife and
my love, l can't live without you
How can l be your wife? You're a Jewish
infidel, you're not allowed to have me
No, no, no, first of all
Jews are not infidels
and in your faith that
you clearly know nothing about
Jews are the people of the book
Second, when you married me
you didn't know l was Jewish
- So you did nothing wrong
- And now l know
- How can l live with you now?
- Very normally
Back in the days of the Prophet
plenty of ladies converted to Islam
and they were living with their infidel
husbands and nothing happened
You're going to make up things now?
Why would l make things up?
To keep living with me is abominable
lt's like... it's like eating with your left hand
instead of the right hand, it's no big deal
By the way, l can bring you
a Sheikh who'll tell you that
- Yes, he's a false Sheikh indeed
- No wait
You lived 7 years with me
You never saw me
praying or even kneeling
although the Prophet said that
he who doesn't pray is an Infidel
- Why did you not leave me?
- Because l was asking God to guide you
l felt you could be
a good man and pray
- l saw you as someone...
- Yes
What kind of a man?
Continue, say it
Honey, l'm still that the same person you
knew, you spent 7 years with and you loved
the father of your children
The only change is that instead
of being Ezzat, l'm Daniel
Yes, indeed
why am l making a fuss about it?
l married a man who
turned out to be an Israeli spy
- What's the big deal?
- If l converted to Islam
would you forgive me?
- No
- Ofcourse not
Because it's not a matter of religion, it's a
matter of the psychological barrier within you
The method of thinking
the culture you were brought upon
that made you hate
anyone who's di_erent
Until you became racist like all Egyptians
Are we racist? What does
that make the Israelis?
The Israeli state includes
more than 1 million Muslim
other than Christians
nomads and Africans
Jews themselves who are living in
Israel came from all over the world
lf we were racist, how did
all these people live together
And if we were racist
how did we make all these economic
scientific and military
achievements at a record time?
lt's because Israel
is the state of order and justice
Nobody is above the law here
Nobody can be a success
by paying bribes and pulling strings
just like you do
By the way, it's not
my personal viewpoint
lt's what your newspapers say
The world is changing and religion is no
Ionger a barrier between two people in love
And l love you
l worship you and
you love me too, l know that
We have only
each other in this world
l can't live without you
No
l swear to God if
you touched me again, l'll kill myself
Alright, alright, it's alright
l'll be patient but not for too long
And if you think that
being nice makes me weak
l'll prove to you you're wrong
Starting today, you're forbidden
to stay alone with your kids without me
And if you want to go
out somewhere, you'll go alone
And very soon, you will stop
going out and seeing your kids again
Yusef, Sarah
Hearing and seeing
the truth from afar is one thing
and living it from within
is a totally di_erent thing
No, you will know
Then no, you will know
You've just come here two days ago
you still haven't seen anything
While sitting
in my air-conditioned o_ice in Egypt
l used to constantly ask myself
what's the use of what we're doing?
And why are we putting up with
this and that, and remaining silent?
Actions speak louder than words
But dogs are loud and
they can be heard Abu-Ziad
Let them bark
l asked the Israeli o_icer to get
you a work permit to enter Tel Aviv
He took a lot of money but it's alright
The doctor will be
expecting us tomorrow
- l don't know what to do
- Don't you be upset, we're used to all that
and we became even scared
we might forget the meaning of fine living
Where are you going?
l want to tell him to come
and have co_ee with us
Don't tell him anything
An Egyptian living amongst
us and taking away our living
and you want to invite him
to have some tea with us
Just butt out
- Come and have tea with us
- Thank you very much
Never mind Salim and what he said
Unfortunately, he's like
plenty of people here
He forgot that we're
brothers and we'll stay brothers
l have a great esteem to Egypt
l know, l know
Believe me
if we weren't in dire need
we wouldn't have come here
and we wouldn't have torn
apart one brick of our fellows' house
Never mind
Hopefully these
houses will be built again
and their people be back
to living in them once again
And this wall will one day
be their prison wall, not ours
Just a second
- Dr Victor
- l'm not his secretary
- Abu-Ziad, my dear friend
- Hello Dr Victor
How are you doing?
- You're Ibrahim
- Hopefully Doctor
Which part of Egypt
are you coming from Ibrahim?
- From Giza sir
- From Giza? Which part of Giza?
The Big Sea Street
or Umraniyyah or Talbiyyah
- Or Hassan Muhammad or Faysal
- Well, well, you know the entire country
You had an army
in Egypt or what Doctor?
- You're so funny, young man
- Thank you
Tell me, if you're brave enough
you'll bare working with me
Well it's not a matter of bravery
But before coming to you
l've been to hell and back
Besides, Abu-Ziad knows very well
that working with him was really tough
- Hey young man
- l meant it was really hard
l didn't mean that Ibrahim, l can't wait
to see someone coming from Egypt
l'd talk to him about Egypt
and know everything about Egypt
And if you're good enough, l won't
stop talking to you about Egypt
- Alright?
- Well you can talk as much as you want
l'm here with you for 24 hours, Doctor
Lisha, take him
to his room and come back to me
Just a second
Why is he so high-strung?
Is something bothering him?
- He's my brother-in-law
- That's it then
You go back
Welcome, welcome Daniel
hello Ma'am, you're most welcome
Now the wedding's complete
- Grab the kids and come on in
- Come on kids
Suzan, come here
- Daniel
- Shalom
Suzan, my wife's niece
her husband Sharukh
- Mrs. Salwa is Egyptian
- Hello
Come on in, come here
l have a surprise for you
l want to introduce
you to a fellow countryman
Mr. Adel Najib from
Kafr al-Sheikh, his wife Mrs. Lillian
They are our
neighbors in Haifa, Mrs. Salwa
- How are you doing?
- Excuse me
l'm sure you'll
get along very well together
l work in an engineer company
building houses and villas
This villa is one of their design
- How long have you been living here?
- Not so long ago
l taught her Arabic, Egyptians impose
themselves wherever they go, mainly here
Egyptians are really something
everybody respects them
The more you stay here, you'll discover
that this country is really di_erent
- Are you a spy too or what?
- What?
You're so stubborn
you didn't do as l told you
And what's the result?
Time's passing by and you still
haven't managed to convince her
to put up with her
situation and life here
Salwa is my wife and
l know her perfectly well
No need to think about that
l know how to deal with this
Yes but enough's enough
And the Mossad units won't be
so patient about it for too long
Because they don't
understand what l'm doing
Then at least explain it to me
Salwa will stay my wife and
she'll willingly choose to live with me
Then, we'll announce it and we'll
see what the whole world would think
when an Egyptian woman declares
she's the wife of a Jewish Israeli man
She bore his kids
and she's so happy with him
Yusha, it's a victory to us without
having to fire a bullet even
Daniel, don't you fool me
you love her
And that's why
l'm sure that l'll succeed
Dance, dance Yusef, dance
You're still upset because l told you that you
won't get out or stay with the kids alone?
No, l'm terrified
- That's why you went out with me today?
- Of course, who knows?
You might take my kids
and never let me see them again
to force me to do whatever you want
Don't worry, l'll never force you
to do what you don't want to do
How will you never
force me to do something
if you'd kidnapped me and
my kids and brought me here?
One day, you'll thank
me for what l did
Anyway, you can get out with the kids
wherever you want, l won't forbid you
- But l only have one request
- You can forget about it
You're playing hard to get?
First of all, you're not my type
Second, l wanted a dish of steak
and potato like the ones you used to do
A dish of steak and potato?
We won't let you
live amongst us, Egyptian
l think you'd better leave
lf you ever touch me again, l'll kill you
- Okay, okay
- Go to your mama
Sarah, Yusef
- What's this noise mom?
- Don't you worry honey, don't worry
- What is it, Mr. Victor?
- This is May 1 , the Holocaust Anniversary
Hitler's massacre
of the Jews in Europe
Therefore
on the same day of each year
they sound this horn to
remember what happened
And when you remember what happened
don't you notice that you're doing to
the Palestinians what has been done to you?
By the way, l'm Jewish not Zionist
You know the di_erence
between the two, Ibrahim?
l know Mr. Victor, l know
- How sweet
- Thank you, thank you
This potato dish smells so good
Nobody touches the potato dish
your father should eat first

- No, l'll eat it with Yusef
- What? Come on, come on
- You're not gonna eat with us?
- No thank you
- l'll bring the boxes from the car Dr
- Alright

Are you happy here?
Of course she's happy

- Let's go, l have to get some stu_
- Thank you
- Goodbye
- Goodbye Victor
Goodbye Rachel, how sweet
we're having plenty of Egyptians here
The Arabic girl is in flat number 2
Search the flat fully
- They entered your flat, are you Palestinian?
- Yes l'm Palestinian
- Why are they after you?
- They caught guns with my brother
And they're arresting all his acquaintances
- Are you armed too?
- No, l'm not
- What's in the bag?
- My stu_ and things
Look, l don't want to be mistreated
l came without a visa, since l got
here, they won't leave me alone
Don't worry, l won't
cause you any trouble
- What's your name?
- Darin
May l stay here till the morning
coz l can't go back to my flat?
- l have nowhere else to go
- Make yourself at home
l'll go get some stu_
and l'll be right back
Don't make any noise and if anyone
knocked on the door, don't open
Okay
- Salwa
- Yeah?
- Open
- l'm getting changed
- Alright, don't you want to go out?
- No thank you
l'm going out, you want
me to get you something?
Thank you
- You're still mad at daddy?
- What are you saying Sarah?
l know you're upset with
dad because he brought us here
- l heard you telling him that
- These are adults' issues honey
Go to bed now
You want us to say
the opening prayers together?
Darin? Darin?
l'm responsible for
the explosion of Disco Nathalie
and no other side is to be
held responsible for that incident
Darin Ghuni
What you're looking
for cannot be found here
This has nothing to do
with you, stay away from me
Let's go, let's go
You assholes
Terrorists
Vahe? Vahe?
Take it o_
Go to the other side quick, get in
- Take o_ your clothes
- What?
lt's no time to ask questions
take o_ your clothes
Check these out
- Give me your IDs
- We're married against her parents' will
Give me your ID
Can you tell me
what you were doing?
Can you tell me why
you want to commit suicide?
- It's none of your business
- l saved your life on several occasions
And l have the right to know
The o_icer who killed
my brother hangs out there
And to take reprisals
you'd commit suicide?
And what other way is there?
Anyway, what does an Egyptian like you
know about the retribution
between us and them?
l know a lot
more than you can imagine
- My wife was killed by one of them
- Your wife? How did she get killed?
l was in a mission outside Egypt
lnstead of killing me
she received the bullet
Back then, l felt like
doing what you're doing
and putting an explosives' belt around
my waist and commit suicide-bombing
But when l calmed down, l found out that we
shouldn't kill ourselves to take vengeance
and that we must stay alive
and be stronger than them
- And who'll avenge my brother?
- Don't worry, hopefully that day will come
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter
l can only say that you
must believe me and trust me
You could have wasted
the work of months in a second
Come here
This bus will take you to Natania
You should go hide there somewhere
and never come back to your country
- l won't see you again?
- l know how to find you
- Take
- What's this?
lt's the key
to our house in the West Bank
Every Palestinian who gets kicked out of his
Iand holds his house key wherever he goes
because he believes
that one day he'll be back
And if he dies, he give it to his
kids or friends or his loved ones?
- l know
- l have nobody left in this world
l wanted to die and take it with
me but now keep it with you
and when you accomplish your
mission, you can give it back to me
- Agreed?
- Agreed, go ahead
Here she is, Salwa come
here and talk to your aunt
Wait, if you want to talk to her again
don't you dare tell her anything
Alright, alright
- Hello?
- Yes Salwa
- Yes aunt
- What's wrong honey? Why are you crying?
- l'm just crying because l missed you
- Tell me how you're doing honey
- How is everything there?
- We'll all fine, l miss you so much
- l was so worried
- We just need to see you
- Where did you go?
- Where are we?
We're in Sharm al-Sheikh, you know Ezzat
he likes to take us on trips around the world
- When will you be back?
- When will we be back?
l'll tell you later, goodbye
- Thank you
- For what? Don't you worry about that
l'm not yourjailer here
and l don't want you to be upset
- But nothing is for free
- What do you mean?
You came with me to the wedding
so l let you go out with the kids
You cooked me a dish of potato
and steak, l let you talk to your aunt
- It's your turn now
- What do you want?
- It's just a small ride somewhere
- Where?
Maybe if you take this ride with me
you would be less scared of me and
of this country and being di_erent
Don't you worry, nothing
will ever change my feelings
Today, they might change
it's up to you to decide
Anyway, it's only a half
an hour ride, you've nothing to lose
Yedoot Ahronot 0aily
So what's the news?
Mustafa told us he managed
to lift Daniel's footprints o_ his safe
- Very good, is there anything else?
- He's sure that Salwa didn't give up
Thank God
- This is my mother
- Welcome, welcome
- How are you doing Daniel?
- Hi mom
How are you doing honey?
Welcome back
Come here, come here
my dears, come here
- Say hi to grandma, kids
- l don't want them to call me grandma
Call me Mom Sarah
What? Why are you so surprised?
You didn't know she was named after me?
Come on kids, go play inside
My parents were from Alexandria
but they were forced to leave Egypt
back in the days of Abdul Nasir
They were scared he might treat
them as Hitler did to the Jews
Alexandria and the days of Alexandria
remained the memory
that kept my mom alive
She wanted to go back
there but unfortunately...
Therefore, as soon as l had
the chance, l went to Alexandria
l went to visit everything there, l saw the
harbor from which your grandparents left
As soon as they left Alexandria
they went to Europe
right after selling everything
they had at quarter the real price
When they turned penniless
they had to move to Israel
They were thrown
in a Kibbutz, i.e. in a colony
l was born there
This colony was in the country
we've been in hell there
because we're Sephardim
i.e. oriental Jews
As to the Ashkenazi, the European Jews
indeed as soon as they arrived there
they were given cars and houses
extending them a warm welcome
But all that changed now
We have heroes now
like Daniel to make us proud
Won't you tell her about your
violent love story with dad?
And you'll stay here with us?
Leave me alone with Sarah
and go check on your kids
l met with Daniel's
father in a Kibbutz
They were kicked out of Iraq
When we got married
l was very young
Do you smoke?
l know you've been very shocked
and it's clear that you're still in a shock
lf you were in my shoes
what would you have felt?
l'm not in your shoes
Believe me, l wouldn't have wanted for my
son to marry anyone but a Jewish girl like us
But it's clear he's
deeply in love with you
Therefore, before you even
think about causing any trouble
ponder upon what's
best for your kids
Just like you're their mother
he's their father and will stay so
This is a status quo
accept it and deal with it
just like l'll accept
you and deal with you
lt's like our entire life, a status quo
Give me the ashtray
Thank you
Get o_
This is a very beautiful garden
You can sit here and think quietly
But know that this is your last chance
You'd either live with me and
the kids just like any normal family
or l'll send you back to Egypt and
the kids will stay here with me of course
The house is nearby
in the next street, number 48
l'm waiting for you
Alright Yusha, l gave
her a last chance today
No, she's under
surveillance, don't worry
- l wanna play ball
- l'll call you back
l'm staying with you, l'm staying
here with you and the kids
Believe me, you made the right decision
And you'll never regret it
l'm the happiest man in the world
Please, please Ezzat not now
be patient with me please
lt's alright, it's alright, don't you
pressure yourself, take your time
Don't look at me, read the newspaper
you receive every day, the ads' page
You'd find a job in Arabic
Apply for thatjob and you'll hopefully
go back to Egypt soon Mrs. Salwa
You finished or not yet?
Let's get out of here
Female employees required
- What does me mean?
- Ani
- And does my name mean?
- Shimi
Bravo
What's this? You learned Hebrew
without telling me or what?
No not at all, but there are some
Arabic articles in this paper
And l read it to have some fun
- Listen up, l'd like to work
- Work?
l read an ad about
a secretary speaking Arabic
And l'd like to apply for the job
lf they want a secretary speaking Arabic, that
doesn't mean she shouldn't speak Hebrew
- What's the big deal? What if l tried?
- You can't, l'm in a delicate position
And due to my work, l cannot be
dealing with people l don't know
- Alright, alright
- Just wait, wait
Work means a CV and an interview
lf they asked you: what does your
husband do? How will you answer?
l'll tell them whatever you want me to say
l'll say you're working in a bank
just like you used to in Egypt
Ezzat, l need this job
l don't know anyone here
l'm so bored at home
and l'm feeling terribly lonely
This is a simple work
and it won't require much e_ort
- Please do me a favor and accept
- Alright then
lf you really want to work
Iet me find you a good job
l have some
good connections here in this country
And l can o_er you a much better
job, with a two times better wage
Your connections?
l thought that the developed state
of Israel is a state of order and justice
And nobody can make
his way by pulling strings
or having relatives
in high ranked positions
And that such things only
happen in underdeveloped states
Alright honey, since you want
this job and it'll make you feel better
and it won't make you feel
so lonely anymore, you can apply for it
But first, let me make sure it's safe
- What? You changed your mind or what?
- Not at all
Let's go
We already called
it's about Salwa Navon
- Do you speak Arabic?
- Yes
Fill this form
Go in there to have an interview
Excuse me, the interview is personal
- Personal?
- Yes, personal
Go on in and l'll wait for you here
- Welcome Mrs. Salwa
- Hello
- Have you ever worked somewhere?
- No
- What degree do you have?
- Business management degree
You're...
Who are you?
l'm an Egyptian o_icer and
l've come to bring you back Mrs. Salwa
- You'll take me back to Egypt?
- Yes
Thank God, thank God
how generous you are, thank God
- But l must go back with my kids
- l'll take you back with your kids
But it's not that easy
At the same time, l don't want
you to be scared or get worried
What do you want me to do?
l'll do anything
You know of course
that your husband was a spy
_es
l want you to help me to get some
information about his stay in Egypt
Yes, just tell me what to do exactly
Mainly, l want you to tell me
about all his moves and actions
And l'll teach you how to do that
Hopefully, with your
help he'll be sanctioned
What sanction?
l cannot do that
Do you realize how much
harm Daniel did to Egypt?
- And you know the truth...
- He's the father of my kids
lf something happened
to him, what should l tell them?
- l cannot harm him
- Daniel can kill you and your kids
if you stood against
his interests or his country's interests
And if you don't know that
your aunt disappeared as soon as you left
- He must have killed her
- You're lying
- l just talked to her on the phone
- It can't be her
And if you picked up the phone
to call her, he won't let you do it indeed
That's impossible, that's impossible
By doing that, you're deciding
to stay here in Israel with your kids
- And to live your entire lives as Zionists
- l'm Muslim
And l'll stay a Muslim
just like my kids, excuse me
And don't worry, my husband
will know nothing about this interview
What will you get from work?
How can someone be sitting
at ease at home and choose to work?
How can someone refuse the comfort?
l forgot about that Rachel and
l don't even want to talk about it
l'll go buy some ice cream to the kids
- You want some?
- No thank you
l'll be right back
- How are you doing today Salwa?
- You?
Look in front of you and act normally
l told you l can't help you
what more do you want from me?
l know he's pressuring
you and you're in a tight fix
But beware, Daniel is trying
to brainwash you any way he can
He must have undermined Egypt and
said that it's no big deal if you were his wife
lf you believed him, soon you'd
find yourself an Israeli Jew, Salwa
Don't be tempted by all
the nice things he's telling you here
because he's hiding the ugly truth
This is a racist society practicing
all kinds of terrorism feeding o_ our blood
You have a big chance
to serve your faith and country
Don't lose it
Think carefully and look
at what's around you Salwa
And be sure of everything
you saw and heard here
because it's a big lie
And if you changed your mind
l'm working in Victor's drugstore
- Who are you calling?
- l'm calling my aunt but she's not answering
Try again
maybe she's in the bathroom
- Hello?
- How are you doing auntie?
How are you doing honey?
How is it going?
l'm fine, thank God
we're happy here in Sharm al-Sheikh
- Tell me auntie
- What dear?
You remember the Sura you used
to read me every day before going to bed?
l want to say it to Sara
but l can't remember it
l forgot it, it's been so long Salwa
- So you don't remember it?
- l remember it but l just want to be sure
Alright, try to be sure
and l'll try to call you again
- Alright honey, and how is Ezzat doing?
- Ezzat, he's fine, thank God
Alright auntie, goodbye
lmagine she forgot the Sura
she used to read me every day
Sarah's medicine is empty
l'll go buy it from the drugstore
When will you
send me back to Egypt?
Hopefully l won't
go back to Egypt without you
Listen carefully and concentrate
The drugstore's
owner will soon be here
- You know the bus station?
- Yeah, the one right next to the garden
Tomorrow at 1 1 am you say
to your friend you was here with you
that you want to buy
a present for Daniel, all alone
And keep the kids
with her, to rest assured
You'll take the bus
from here and go down
On your way back, you'll ride
the same bus but the other way
- Don't you get lost
- No, don't worry
l speak a bit of English, l can manage
- Take care of them
- Alright
Love, sweet love, you know what l'll do to
you if you don't show me the gift you'd buy?
- No, l'll do it, goodbye
- Say bye to mommy
- Bye
- Bye
That man's saying that
you're the ugliest lady in Israel
l told him you're
beautiful but he insisted
Move away, move away
l won't let you go
- l feel like a traitor
- He's not your husband
And you must know that
your marriage is no longer o_icial
And if anything happen between
you two, it would be like adultery
- Do you love him?
- He's my husband and the father of my kids
- l don't know what to do, l don't know
- Choose
Put your faith
and country in one hand
and the man you say
he's your husband who betrayed you
and kidnapped you
and your kids in another hand
And you can see
who's more important
But l won't help you until you
assure me that he won't be harmed
How is that?
You know what Daniel did in Egypt?
- l would never leave him
- Alright, l'm leaving
- Wait
- Promise me first
l promise you, just bear with me
there's something l'd like to know
Did something happen between you
two? Did you give yourself to him?
- No
- Don't give up
- l should leave coz l'm late
- Just a second
You brought him this frame
as a gift because he let you work
lt's true you didn't work but it was
so nice of him to give you the chance to try
Therefore you bought him a gift
While giving him the picture frame
tell him you no longer want to work
- l already told him so
- Great
You started working with us now
And l want you to start asking
him to go out with you every day
Of course, he can't
do that due to his job
Thus, he'll try to make up
for it by letting you go out alone
l can see you in
the garden every day with the kids
And if you kept nagging on him
Salwa, like any true Egyptian wife
he'd beg you to leave him alone
- When will you send me back to Egypt?
- Soon hopefully
And if you helped me more
it'll be sooner than you think
How can l help you?
First of all, l can't tell you enough
how much you should be
careful and beware of everything
You're in the hornets' nest
So every breath
you take is under surveillance
Take good care of yourself
- The picture frame went fine
- It went fine, sir
And a phone is ringing
now in Daniel's o_ice
Hello?
You must know that every information
no matter how small, is important
Memorize every move that Daniel
takes, and every phone number
Then, write it all
down when you're alone
And while being
in the garden with the kids
seize the opportunity while
Rachel is not paying attention
and throw
the info paper in the trash can
And if l wanted to send you any
message l'll put it in Sara's medicine box
Salwa if you felt hesitating or
in danger, don't take any risk
And believe me
l'm by your side, watching over you
And l'll never leave you
You little devil, how did
you find out about this place?
Yusha's wife told me all about it
- l'll go try this on, take care of the kids
- Alright
This dress is so beautiful
How much is it? No, the doctor
forbade me to wear such outfits
- What is it?
- Your husband's boss
is the head of the Mossad assassination unit
which means that the network Daniel
formed in Egypt will carry out assassinations
And what am l
supposed to do about that?
We must know who
is getting assassinated in Egypt
- Alright, l'll go ask him
- You will do no such thing indeed
Then what should l do?
What do you want?
Look carefully at these pictures
and tell me if anyone
of those met your husband
Yes, l think l saw him talk to
this man down our house's entrance once
And when l asked him about it
he said he's his bank colleague
and came to ask him for a favor
- Anyone else?
- No
- You want something else from me now?
- No
- You think there's hope?
- Only desperate and weak people say that
- And what are we?
- We are strong and very strong too
- Whenever we need to be so
- l feel l'll never get back to Egypt
Everything around me
makes me feel that this is a status quo
There's no such
thing as a status quo
- Don't you surrender Salwa
- Salwa, what took you so long?
Coming, coming
- You had me worried
- l'm done, let's go Sarah
- What's this rudeness?
- It's alright, it's alright
- l want to watch cartoons
- No, we'll watch the lesson
- l want to watch cartoons
- No, the lesson
- No, cartoons
- What were you doing in Egypt?
- No, cartoons
- No, cartoons
Go ahead kids
go ahead, go inside, go on
When l insisted on bringing you
here to live with me in Tel Aviv
lt wasn'tjust something
impossible for any security o_icer
No, it wasn't even
possible for any Jew
The devout Jew would never allow
his non-devout wife to touch his food
because our faith tells us so
l didn'tjust allow you to touch my
food, although you're Muslim Arabic
No, even if l knew
you poisoned my food, l'd eat it
because l love you
to the point that l'd rather die
than live knowing that you hate me
- Why are you saying that?
- Did anyone recruit you?
Recruit me? Of course not
what are you talking about?
Then, l'm willing
to answer all of your questions
What was l doing in Egypt? Recruiting spies
working in politics and stock exchange
to provide us with information
we can use against Egypt
You don't want to know
who these spies are?
What are their names?
Addresses? Where do they work?
You misunderstood me, all the people
around us are talking about your exploits
lt's only natural for me to want
to know about these exploits
And l believe you
Anyway, the file including
all information about my entire mission
is in my o_ice in the Mossad
l can get it for you to read it
and you can keep it ifyou like
Salwa, could you please
get me a nescafe cup?
You should know that this
is the last time we ever meet
He said most simply that the file
you want is in his o_ice in the Mossad
God knows if it's true or false
or if he even doubted me or no
And please don't tell me
to ask him another question
And if it means that l won't be back
to Egypt, l don't ever want to go back
l told you never to ask him
- And this is the biggest mistake you did
- l just did it
Just calm down
Listen, in the upcoming period
l want you to act very naturally
Salwa, especially before him
Anyway
we will soon get back to Egypt
Goodbye
Some people
in the country asked me to call you
Where?
- Welcome back
- Thank you sir
What?
The information we need
are in the o_ice of a Mossad o_icer
Then forget about the information
you need and go back to Egypt
l can't go back to Egypt
without these information
And l could never ask from anyone
to get a piece of paper from the Mossad
- Despite my connections
- l don't want anyone to get me anything
l want to get into
the Mossad building by myself
- You must be joking
- Sir it's a matter of national security
And if didn't get
this information as quickly as possible
Egypt would be in danger
Then what have l been doing
here for more than 20 years?
You must know how to draw
back, to cut back our losses
Sir, l can't deny your expertise
But this is a risk to be taken
and if there's a 1 O/o
possibility that l'm right
l must get into the Mossad building
to retrieve that information in person
- You love the theater?
- l don't get it
Belin is a great actor but
we have better actors in Egypt
Go to the theater
and he'll help you
These are vitamins
take them when necessary
lf you felt sick
they'll take you to the hospital
To them, you're an important
catch and they'll try to save you
Thanks a lot sir
Come in
There's a fan
who wants to see you outside
Let him in
- Shalom
- Shalom
l'm a big fan and
would like to talk to you
My friend told me you can teach me
l meet fans in the Arabic
restaurant in Nazareth
l got it
Listen, l only feel good here
This place is quiet
and nobody knows me
because Arabs and even Israeli
Arabs aren't interested in the Israeli art
And no matter how many movies and
series the state makes them to Judaize them
they watch Adel Imam
saying: l'm always used to do so
which would make
them forget all their worries
Listen up, l know you used
to work with the Mossad
What guarantees do l have
that you won't sell me out?
Because you pay more
Besides, when l worked with the Mossad
they recruited me against my will
They asked me to spy on my friends
and relatives, the Russian Jewish emigrates
Not only that, here we're third
degree citizens along with African Jews
That's why
l'm working for you at will
And how will you help me
get into the Mossad building?
The Mossad building is a public building
including every day thousands of people
Employees, workers, accountants
With a simple authorization
you can enter the gate
This is my authorization
along with a detailed map of the place
The o_ice of Daniel Navon
you know where it is?
Yes l know, l went in there once
it's in the 4th floor with number 5 outside
But to enter there
you need his personal card
and it's up to you to get it
because l cannot help you with it
Be careful
on the gate there are two men
You'll go to this man and
he'll let you in, he is one of ours
He asks for a huge
sum of money but his role is important
Listen, beware
not to go to this man
He'll recognize you
from the first attempt
He's a sulky man who never smiled
l want to tell you something else
You might need some luck because
l can't guarantee you'd get out of there alive
Mom, this is my friend
Hello, how are you doing?
What's your name?
- Isabel
- Isabel, it's a nice name
See? They have friends
and they'll be happy and play
And soon Isabel will be picking her
up from the house to go out together
- Shalom
- Shalom
- You're Isabel's mother?
- Yes
- This is Sarah's mother
- Hello, my name's Salwa
- You're Arabic?
- Yes we're Egyptians
lsabel, let's go right now
Don't be upset about it Sarah
When you see that girl again
here, you don't play with her
Go play with your brother Yusef
That's a despicable
racist lady, it's strange
By the way, people
here are not like that
l'll go get some water in order
not to choke on her racism
Don't be upset Sarah
go play with Yusef honey, go on
Look towards the beach
and don't look at me while talking
Salwa, l want the card used
by Daniel to get into his o_ice
l'm sorry, l told you
l can't help you again
lt's alright Salwa
this is the last favor l ask you
And hopefully if we stayed alive
we'll get back to Egypt tomorrow
- Tomorrow?
- Look straight ahead
But you promised me
that Ezzat won't get hurt
and if he lost this card
he'll be in trouble at work
lf Daniel were to choose between
you and his work, he'll choose his work
Notjust that, if he felt for
a second you're getting in his way
- He'll kill you
- This is nonsense, you don't know him
Neither do you, don't worry Salwa, what
l'm asking from you puts only me in danger
He's going to work tomorrow?
- He's going to work tomorrow?
- No, tomorrow's his day o_
He stays home all day long
Then l'll wait for you in
the drugstore in a couple of hours
You'll find that card
in his wallet or in his pocket
Did you hear anything Sara?
Yes l heard that
you'll take the card from dad
Honey, l'm preparing a surprise to dad
Don't you tell him anything
it'll be our little secret, don't you say anything
l don't care about
Palestinian kids that will get killed
Let's carry out the operation
My dear kids
- Dad, l want to tell you a secret
- You want to tell me a secret?
What is it honey?
Alright honey, go to your room
- Sarah, hey girl
- Salwa, l need a word you
Sarah told me about
what happened in the garden
Don't you believe her
she misunderstood
Rachel was with us too
if you want to ask her about it
Please don't you keep
any such thing from me
l was expecting such a thing but l didn't
expect it to happen in front of my girl
Believe me, she misunderstood
she's just a kid
No, no, no, l'll go
to the garden with you tomorrow
And l'll see that despicable racist lady who
refused to let her daughter play with Sarah
And l'll teach her
a lesson she'll never forget
She's a wretched lady
l was going to give her a scolding
if it weren't for Rachel
Really, but l don't
want you to be upset
l know Israelis aren't racist at all
l've been moving around
the place and l've never had any trouble
- You're so sweet Salwa
- Thank you
Sarah, Sarsura sweetie
Wait for me tomorrow
with your kids at 12 pm
in a restaurant called Shira
next to the Habayib shops
You'll find its name in English
lf l didn't get back in an hour, go back
to your house as if nothing happened
- What do you mean by that?
- Then l'd be caught
- And God knows if l'd be alive or...
- Or what?
l know nobody else here, you're
the only one who shares my blood
Don't worry Salwa, if l failed
others will come to take you back to Egypt
Don't worry
- How are you doing Mrs. Salwa?
- How are you doing Dr?
The doctor is telling you hi Mrs. Salwa
The doctor is telling you hi Mrs. Salwa
l'm fine, thank you
Goodbye Mrs. Salwa, goodbye
Shalom, this is my authorization to enter
Come and take my place
- Where's your sulky colleague?
- He was inside, there he is
l can't go any further
Take these floors
to the first floor, room number 5
And that's all you need
l'm inside
l entered using Benin's
authorization as agreed
But the strange thing is
that the sulky man smiled to me
The safe works
by fingerprints as we expected
Hopefully the fingerprint
transfer would work
List of assassinations
Architect Ahmad Amr Said
Dr Majid Majdi Mikhail
Dr Hasan Majid Mursi
lt's clear that l was
in the assassination list
l was waiting for you
what took you so long?
This is the history, guys
The history of intelligence
is written in front of you
Nobody ever understood what
l was thinking about, Mr. Mustafa
until they made me doubt myself
Why did you bring your wife with you?
You could have left her in Egypt
How? Since she's a great bait
And just like a good hunter
l put the bait on the hook and threw it
l waited, patiently, patiently...
until l caught you
Well done brother Daniel, well done
lt's a perfectly tight plan
but there's a simple thing
you didn't take into consideration
And this is your problem, that you're
always looking at the story from your side
lt's the Zionist system we're all aware of
lt's only one story
and there's no two sides to it
Yes there is
there is for instance that l promised your
wife and kids to take them back to Egypt
- How? By train
- l hate trains, cousin
By motor-car
- Stay right there
- What? What is it?
l was just leaving him a mark
so that you'd recognize him
Have you lost your mind you asshole?
l'll bury you here, l'll show you
Show me what you'll do with
the information you've discovered
Tell Kamal what happened
Sarah, Yusef?
Sarah?
- Haven't you seen the kids?
- l guess they went out with their dad, why?
- Don't you know where they went?
- What do l know?
- You must know where he took them
- No, l don't
Did you do something to upset him?
You must have done something to him
Go wait for him inside, go on
What's this? How dare
you talk to me with that tone?
- Mom
- Sarah
Go wait for him inside
- Everything's fine?
- Yes, yes, everything's alright
You really thought you were
getting into the Mossad system
and you'd be
able to leave unharmed?
This is the biggest intelligence
service around the world
Why don't you want to learn?
Why don't you want
to know your real size?
You know, that if l were you
l wouldn't make such a wish
because if we were
to really know our size
you'd realize how small
and insignificant you are
What were you doing here Mustafa?
This is not your land or country
You know l was going
to tell you the same thing?
- This isn't your land or country
- My worlds are the only truth Mustafa
lt's a status quo
The status quo is that each
citizen in Israel is a soldier
Besides, you're building gates, passageways
and a separation wall to protect you
Why are you doing all that?
because you're like the thief who stole and
is forced to confront his victim every day
You're scared
Time is running and we
have some work to do
You know her, right?
ls he the man who went out
of the night club with you?
Well done Mustafa, your cape was
hiding your face o_ the cameras
Congratulations, you became a terrorist
Darin
- Did you fall in love with her or what?
- l'll show you hell on earth
Then, you'll beg me
to shoot you like a stray dog
to be spared the torture
l'm gonna inflict you
Go ahead, start
the investigation and be done with it
l'd love to keep up
this enjoyable conversation
but unfortunately, l must get to work
l'll tell you something
you indeed know nothing about
Our Mossad scientists managed
to develop the use of electricity in torture
so that it'd would straight
get to the nerve centers
lt's hard, right?
Before coming here
l was interrogating one of your agents
He gave me some
very important information
The information
he gave me was that you're dirty
- Who helped you in Israel?
- Your wife
Khazak
Who else?
- l couldn't get to your mother
- Talk Mustafa
- Who helped you in Israel? l'll kill you
- You know l won't talk
And that l'm not scared of you or of dying
lncrease the voltage
Salwa and your kids
will get back to Egypt
They'll get back to Egypt
and they'll stay Muslim Egyptians
This is the key
of our house in the West Bank
This wall will one day
become their prison wall, not ours
You think we have hope?
Welcome back
you're still under the pill's e_ect
l'm fine sir
When l saw that they let
me in so easily, l took the pill
Salwa didn't leave her house
they must have locked her in
lt might be dangerous to try
and get her out
What do you mean by that sir?
Cover our back
we're going out, we're going out
l'm fine
l've been shot in my shoulder
Go get Salwa
and my men will take me back
Take this bag
you'll find in it everything you need
l'll go get them and take the Kilo
48 road, at night, l'll cross the borders
- l'll see you there
- Hopefully
Hopefully
You had the chance to live in a good place
with a hero that
any women would long to be with
But what can l say?
You Arabs love to stay poor
Cough honey, cough, if only you'd die
with your brothers to be done with you
- Hello, yeah Daniel?
- How is it with you?
- Everything is fine, don't you worry
- The task force is on the way
We're waiting for you
Come on quickly
Watch out
Go to the parking lot, if l didn't
meet you in 2 minutes, go to the Kilo 48
There's a deserted factory there
they'll come and pick you up at night
Just a second, let me open the car
They ran away
- Rachel and Benhas are knocked out
- What are you saying?
l'm going up alone
Get in quickly
Go to the parking lot
if l didn't meet you in 2 minutes
go to a deserted factory in Kilo 48 and
they'll come and pick you up there at night
We're heading to the borders now?
That won't do
orders are to cross the borders
All units, all units
the target's is in Eshil Street
Don't kill them
l want them alive, l want them alive
Abort, the target is being dealt with
and he should be finished o_
as well as all those with him
No Yusha, no, they're
my wife and kids, not the enemy
They are the enemy
they're not Jews, they're all traitors
And they must be finished o_
- Without any exception
- Yusha
- Sit back with the kids
- Beware kids, come on, come on
We cannot shoot them
too many civilians
Roger that, backup is on the way
You're alright?
Watch out
How can they spot us?
Search the kids to see if they're
bugged with any GPS tools, quickly
Come here Yusef
don't be scared, stand up
- What's this necklace?
- Dad gave it to me
- Throw it away
- Alright
Are you alright?
Hold on tight, kids
l'll stop here and
l want you to get down quickly
Where will you keep going?
It's the end of the bridge
- l said: Get down quickly
- Alright, alright
- Come here
- Go on
Come on
Come on, quickly
Why can't we just go to the Egyptian
embassy and be done with this?
Diplomatic movements are a totally di_erent
thing from what we're doing now Salwa
Let's find a car to open
- How do you do that?
- l'll teach you once we get back home
Yusha, Yusha, it's over Yusah, the car
crashed o_ the bridge and they all died
You owe me, after all
the favors l've done you
lt's now time to pay your debts
This factory has been
deserted for a long time
lt's the safest place
to hide until the night falls
Come here
- Bless you Sarah, bless you honey
- She must take her medicine
- And l forgot to bring it
- l'll go find the nearest drugstore
- We'll come with you
- No, here you'll be safe
And if anything happened to me
l'd be sure you'll go back to Egypt
l used to be surprised to hear
about a man killing his wife and kids
But l no longer find it strange
- He's not in the car
- Look for him everywhere
Move
What is it? What is it?
- l killed him, l killed him
- It's over Salwa
Your sleazy Arabic origin
is urging you to betray your husband
- l hate you, l hate you
- Daniel, Daniel, Daniel
Fakhi, Fakhi
He won't be able to get to the phone
right now, you can send him a message
Put your gun down
How can this be?
How can the end be so soon?
And you won't even
have the time to watch
- What made you so aggressive, cousin?
- You still haven't seen anything
My son, we're the
chosen people of God
Do you really believe
what you're saying?
- Let's negotiate
- Is that so?
You have a feeling
that your time has come, right?
Take Salwa and go
just leave the kids and l'll let you go
l'll take Salwa and the kids
and l won't let you go
Salwa, Salwa, this is the man
you didn't want me to hurt?
This is your husband
the father of your kids?
He wanted to massacre
you all, he's a piece of shit
You're going back or what?
We'll be back but not now
