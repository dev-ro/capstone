Do you think we are too harsh?
I understand
You're young
you don't care about the past
We,  Serbs faught the Turks 
 500 years .
To stop them from  conquerring  Europe.
We stood against the Austro-Hungarian empire.
And we brought them down!
We kicked Hitler's arse , and we won 
A million Serbs were killed
in the second World War 
This land is soaked with Serbian blood ,
and now they want us  to live here ..
Under   Muslim rule?
In the Muslim state ?
Sometimes I recognize people.
I get  into their  house  and arecognize  their faces.
you just pretent to be a 
good neighbor, Daniel.
Under Tito, they hid their traitors faces 
waiting the opportunity to destroy Yugoslavia!
and attack us !
- I am a Serb patriot , you don't have to question that .
Are you?
But you question our methods ...
Do you think the rest of the world will 
ignore all this?
I do not.
The UN has sent a force of peacekeepers for  Croatia.
 they will not return their backs 
Of course. They see,
but they will do nothing .
Serbs are the only  serious army 
in this part of Europe.
They know that we are partners

Whatever we do, the less
the opportunity to go unnoticed.
Now what?
Radovan and politicians will bee kissing
 international tv's ass ?
Trying to make it looks like nothing is happening ..  Why?
The UN and UNPROFOR  do nothing,
 but stay there on the other side 
We're now ready !

I am Danijel Vukojevic
I am a  criminal of war.
My name is Danijel Vukojevic.
I am a criminal of war .
 Three and a half years, the international community
without success, could not stop the war in Bosnia. </ i>
 occupation of Sarajevo was the longest
in recent history. </ i>
 Nationwide, 1 out of 2 Bosnian
was forced to flee their homes. </ i>
 During the war, 50,000 women Bosnicas
 were raped, </ i>
 that led to the first conviction for sexual exploitation
violence, individually, as a crime against humanity. </ i>
 The war in Bosnia has been one of the largest
conflict in Europe since World War II Mundiala. </ i>
 Since 1995, he got a unstable
peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. </ i>
 there is still a great divide,
and the struggle for reconciliation continues. </ i>
