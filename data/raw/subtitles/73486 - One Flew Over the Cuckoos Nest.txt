Hi.
PILBOW: Mr. McMurphy's here.
RATCHED: All right.
RATCHED: All right, I'm ready.
PILBOW: Okay. One pair of socks.
T-shirt.
McMURPHY: Hi.
Goddamn, boy,
you're as big as a mountain!
Looks like you might have played
some football.
What's your name?
BILLY: He can't hear you. He's deaf.
Deaf and dumb Indian.
Is that so?
MARTINl: Come on, Bibbit.
McMURPHY:
Can't even make a sound, huh?
How.
Wah-wah-wah...
Club lead. Jack of clubs.
Ha-ha...oh, oh.
McMURPHY: What's your name, son?
Billy Bibbit.
McMURPHY: Glad to know you, Bill.
McMurphy's mine.
Aa-ha-ha...
That's old Charlie Cheswick's cards.
HARDING: That's his ace of spades.
HARDING: Your turn, Bill.
HARDING: Big ten.
HARDING: Put one of them on it, will you?
CHESWICK: Wait a minute.
CHESWICK: Oh, I can win that one.
CHESWICK: I win.
HARDING: Oh, you overtrumped?
CHESWICK: Sure.
McMURPHY: Pinochle, Bill?
McMURPHY: What's the bid?
BILLY: Five... Five-fifty.
You like to look at other people's cards,
do you?
Yes.
Ever seen this one?
-Come on, Martini.
-Martini!
HARDING: Martini, will you?
Will you play a club?
CHESWICK: Whose turn is it now?
HARDING: Let's see, he trumped...
HARDING: Where you going?
-Aren't you going to play?
-What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna play, Martini?
Martini? I want to play.
Billy?
Billy, I want to win some...
Get a grip on yourself, will you?
[Knock on door]
Yes?
-Mr. McMurphy's here, Doc.
-Good, have him come in.
SPIVEY: Thank you.
McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey.
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is
to meet you.
Sure. Pull up a chair,
sit down and let's talk.
Sure.
[Spivey clears his throat]
SPIVEY: R.P. McMurphy.
That's a hell of a fish there, Doc.
SPIVEY: Isn't that a dandy?
McMURPHY: Yeah.
McMURPHY: It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?
SPIVEY: No, 32.
McMURPHY: Thirty-two.
But I'll tell you,
it took every bit of strength I had...
SPIVEY: ...to hold it
while the guy took the picture.
Every damn bit.
Probably that chain
didn't help it any, either.
You didn't weigh the chain, did you?
No, I didn't weigh the chain.
SPIVEY: But I'm awfully proud
of that picture.
That's the first Chinooker I ever caught.
It's a nice one.
Randall Patrick McMurphy.
Thirty-eight years old.
What can you tell me about...
...why you've been sent over here?
Well...
I don't know.
What's it say there?
McMURPHY: Mind if I smoke?
SPIVEY: No, go right ahead.
SPIVEY: Well, it...
...says several things here.
SPIVEY: It said you've been belligerent.
Talked when unauthorized.
You've been resentful in attitude
towards work, in general. That you're lazy.
Chewing gum in class.
[McMurphy chuckles]
The real reason
that you've been sent here...
...is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.
SPIVEY: To determine whether or not
you're mentally ill.
This is the real reason.
Why do you think they might think that?
[McMurphy sighs]
Well, as near as I can figure out,
it's 'cause I...
...fight and fuck too much.
In the penitentiary?
No, no, no, you mean why...
SPIVEY: Why did you get sent over here...
...from the work farm?
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh...
Well, I really don't know, Doc.
It says here that you went around...
SPIVEY: Let me just take a look...
McMURPHY: It ain't up to me, you know.
SPIVEY: One...
...two, three...
...four...
You've got at least...
...five arrests for assault.
What can you tell me about that?
Five fights, huh?
Rocky Marciano's got 40,
and he's a millionaire.
-That's true.
-That is true.
Of course, it's true that you went in for...
...statutory rape.
That's true, is it not, this time?
McMURPHY: Absolutely true. But, Doc...
...she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc...
...and she told me she was 18,
and she was...
McMURPHY: ...very willing,
you know what I mean?
I practically had to take
to sewing my pants shut.
But between you and me...
...she might have been 15.
When you get that little red beaver...
...right there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.
And I don't think you do, either.
I hear what you're saying.
McMURPHY:
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...
...'cause I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.
It don't make a bit of sense to me.
If that's what being crazy is...
...then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, whacko.
McMURPHY: But, no more, no less.
That's it.
To be honest with you, McMurphy...
...what it says here...
SPIVEY: ...is that...
...they think...
They think...
...you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.
SPIVEY: What do you think about that?
Do I look like that kind of guy to you?
Well...
Let's just be frank for a minute.
All right, Randall, if you would.
Tell me...
Do you think there's anything wrong
with your mind, really?
Not a thing, Doc.
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.
Well...
You're going to be here for a period,
for us to evaluate you.
SPIVEY: We're going to study you.
McMURPHY: Mm-hmm.
SPIVEY: We'll make our determinations
as to what we're going to do...
...and give you the necessary treatment
as indicated.
Doc, let me just tell you this.
I'm here to cooperate with you
a hundred percent.
McMURPHY: A hundred percent.
I'll be just right down the line with you.
You watch.
'Cause I think we ought to get
to the bottom of...
...R.P. McMurphy.

BANCINl: I'm awfully tired.
WASHINGTON: Sit down.
BANCINl: I'm tired.
WASHINGTON: Is that better?
[Coughing, background]
WASHINGTON: Mr. Ellsworth...
...you'll wear yourself out.
RATCHED: All right, gentlemen, let's begin.
At the close of Friday's meeting...
...we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.
RATCHED: Mr. Harding stated
that his wife made him uneasy...
...because she drew stares
from men on the street.
RATCHED: Is that correct, Mr. Harding?
Yes.
That's correct.
RATCHED: He also thinks he may have
given her reason...
...to seek sexual attention elsewhere,
but he wasn't able to say how.
RATCHED: Mr. Harding has been heard
to say to his wife:
"I hate you.
"I don't ever want to see you again.
"You've betrayed me."
So, does anyone care
to touch on this further?
[Coughing, background]
[Shuffling of papers]
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?
RATCHED: Are you sure?
Billy, how about you?
No, no, ma'am.
RATCHED: I'd like to write in my book
that you began the meeting.
[Coughing, background]
RATCHED: Just once.
[Rippling of cards]
[Rippling of cards]
Mr. Martini?
Are you with us?
Yes.
RATCHED: Would you like to begin?
[Patient clears his throat, background]
[Coughing, background]
Mr. Cheswick?
CHESWICK: Me?
RATCHED: Yes.
You mean there's not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter?
[Patient clears his throat, background]
RATCHED: All right.
RATCHED: Mr. Harding...
...you've stated on more than
one occasion...
...that you've suspected your wife
of seeing other men.
Oh, yes!
Yes, very much, I suspect her.
I suspect her.
Maybe you can tell us why...
...you suspect her.
Well, I can only...
...speculate as to the reasons why.
Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding...
...that perhaps you are...
RATCHED: ...impatient with your wife...
...because she doesn't meet
your mental requirements?
HARDING: Perhaps. But you see,
the only thing I can really...
...speculate on, Nurse Ratched...
...is the very existence of my life...
...with or without my wife...
...in terms of the human relationships,
the juxtaposition of...
...one person to another,
the form, the content.
Harding, why don't you knock off
the bullshit and get to the point?
This is the point.
This is the point, Taber. It's not bullshit.
I'm not just talking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life!
HARDING: I can't seem to get that
through to you.
I'm not just talking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody!
I'm talking about form!
I'm talking about content!
I'm talking about interrelationships!
I'm talking about God, the Devil,
Hell, Heaven!
Do you understand? Finally?
TABER: Yeah, Harding,
you're so fucking dumb I can't believe it.
[Sefelt laughs]
It makes me feel very peculiar,
very peculiar...
-...when you throw in something like that.
-Why?
What does that mean, "peculiar," Harding?
FREDERICKSON: Peculiar?
TABER: Peculiar?
CHESWICK:
I'm gonna tell you guys something.
You just don't want to learn anything.
You just don't want to listen to anybody.
He's got intelligence!
You've never heard the word "peculiar"?
Say, what are you trying to say?
You trying to say I'm queer? Is that it?
Little Mary Ann? Little Marjorie Jane?
HARDING: Is that what you're trying
to tell me?
Is that your idea of communicating
something to me?
Well, is it?
CHESWICK: They're all crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.
They're all ganging up on you.
Is that news?
No...
They sometimes want to gang up on me,
too, but l...
Cheswick, do me a favor.
Take it easy.
HARDING: And stay off my side.
CHESWICK: But I only want to...
I only want to help you.
HARDING: I understand.
CHESWICK: But don't you want me to...?
HARDING: Please!
CHESWICK: But I only want to...
-Please!
-But I only want to help you.
Please!
HARDING: You see...
...the other day you made some allusions,
both of you.
FREDERICKSON: Illusions?
HARDING: Yes, allusions.
HARDING: Not illusions. Allusions...
...to sexual problems
I might be having with my wife.
Let's say it's true!
Let's say I know it's true, but you don't!
If that's your idea of trying
to tell me something...
You know, Harding,
I think you're some kind of morbid asshole!
SEFELT: "Peculiar!"
HARDING: "Asshole" again.
FREDERICKSON:
It makes you feel "peculiar."
TABER: You've talked about your wife
ever since I can remember!
You know, she's on your mind,
and blah, blah...
I'm not talking about my wife!
When will you get that through your thick,
fucking head?
When are you gonna wise up
and turn her loose?
HARDING: Please!
CHESWICK: I don't want to hear it!
BANCINl: I'm tired.
CHESWICK: I don't want to hear it!
BANCINl: I'm tired.
CHESWICK: I don't want to hear it.
CHESWICK: I don't want to hear it.
BANCINl: It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.
CHESWICK: I don't want to hear it!
MILLER: We know you're tired.
We're all tired.
BANCINl: I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.
MILLER: You're not tired, Bancini.

Ever play this game, Chief?
Come on, I'll show you.
McMURPHY: Old Indian game.
McMURPHY: It's called
"put the ball in the hole."
Now, that ought to be just...
Hold it right there.
All right.
Now, that's your spot. Don't move.
Never move. That's your spot,
you understand?
Right there. You don't move. Now...
McMURPHY: ...take the ball.
McMURPHY: Here, take the ball.
McMURPHY: That's it. Hold on to it.
Not too hard, Chief.
You'll crush all the air out of it.
We're gonna put her in the basket.
You understand?
McMURPHY: All right.
Now, raise up your arms.
McMURPHY: Raise the ball up in the air!
Raise it up.
WASHINGTON: McMurphy?
What the hell are you talking to him for?
He can't hear a fucking thing.
I ain't talking to him.
I'm talking to myself. It helps me think.
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.
Well, it don't hurt him, either, does it?
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?
See? Don't hurt him.
All right, now, Chief.
Let's raise our hands up in the air.
Just raise them up.
Up, you understand?
Raise the hands up, here.
Up. Raise your hands up.
Up! That's it! That's it!
Up, all the way up.
McMURPHY: All the way up.
That's a baby, all right.
McMURPHY: Okay, now...
Now, jump up in the air,
and put it in the basket, Chief.
Jump up and dunk it in!
Jump up in the air and stuff
that son of a bitch in there, Chief.
McMURPHY: Take a rest, Chief.
Just stay right there.
Take a rest. I'll be right back.
McMURPHY:
Bancini, come here for a minute.
You're looking all right.
Get right over here for a second.
McMURPHY: Now, just stand right there.
Just get down a little bit.
All right. Stand up.
Stand up. Go ahead.
That's a baby! All right, you got it.
All right. Now, over there.
McMURPHY: Hit me, Chief!
I got the moves! I got them, Chief!
Hold it right there. Give me the ball.
Give me the ball. That's it.
Thank you, Chief.
Now...
...hold it right there.
You take the ball, you jump up,
and put it in the basket.
See what I mean? Put it...
Bancini, hold still.
All right, Chief, here. Take the ball.
McMURPHY: Now, jump up
and put it in the basket, Chief!
McMURPHY: Jump up
and put it in the basket!
Not you, Bancini.
Raise up! Bancini, where you going?
BANCINl: I'm tired!
McMURPHY:
Fast break! Defense! Get back!
McMURPHY: Come on, Bancini,
where the fuck you going at?
General, get this man around here.
That's it, back!
Over to Chief.
Fast break! Fast break! Hit me, Chief!
McMURPHY: Hit me, baby!
Put it in the basket, Chief!
Put it in the basket!

Make the bets.
It's a dime, Martini.
MARTINl: I bet a nickel.
A dime's the limit, Martini.
MARTINl: I bet a dime.
This is not a dime, Martini.
This is a dime.
If you break it in half...
...you don't get two nickels, you get shit.
Try and smoke it. You understand?
McMURPHY: You don't understand!
All right, here they come.
Queen to the Chesser,
Big Bull to Tabulations...
...ten to Billy to match his whang,

MARTINl: Hit me. Hit me.
McMURPHY: I can't hit you because it ain't
your turn yet. You understand?
You see these other people?
These are the real ones.
These are real people here.
What'll you do, Ches? Hit or sit?
CHESWICK: Um...
Hit me.
McMURPHY: That's 23 up, Cheswick.
Taber, you're busted. Give me this.
Twenty-three.
-Hit me.
-Shut up!
McMURPHY: Taber.
McMURPHY: Give me a dime!

McMURPHY: Five.
You didn't make a bet, Martini.
I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.
MARTINl: I bet a dime.
McMURPHY: All right, here.
McMURPHY: That's 20 showing.
MARTINl: No.
McMURPHY: Take your money.
MARTINl: No.
MARTINl: It's not.
It's 10, 11, 12, 13.
This is a fucking queen here,

You don't count the this and the this.
Hit me.

MARTINl: This isn't a queen!
MARTINl: Mac, hit me.
-Who's pitching the opener?
-Hit me.
McMURPHY: Jesus Christ Almighty!
Do you nuts want to play cards
or do you want to fucking jerk off?
TABER: Play the game!
I can't even hear myself think already, here.
Aah...!
Stay back!
McMURPHY: Excuse me. I just wanted...
Stay back!
Patients aren't allowed
in the nurses' station.
McMURPHY: Well, I just wanted to turn...
When you're outside, we'll discuss
whatever problem you have, okay?
The patients are not allowed
in the nurses' station. All right?
McMURPHY: Yes, ma'am.
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you.
Excuse me, miss.
McMURPHY: Do you think it might be
possible to turn the music down...
...so maybe a couple of the boys
could talk?
That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy.
I know, but do you think
we might ease it down a little...
...so maybe the boys didn't have to shout?
What you probably don't realize...
...is that we have a lot of old men
in this ward...
...who couldn't hear the music
if we turned it lower.
That music is all they have.
Your hand is staining my window.
McMURPHY: I'm sorry, ma'am.
RATCHED: All right.
PILBOW: Mr. McMurphy, your medication.
What's in the horse pill?
It's just medicine. It's good for you.
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking
something if I don't know what it is.
Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.
I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.
It's just that I don't want anyone
to try and slip me saltpeter.
You know what I mean?
[Tapping]
RATCHED: It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want
to take his medication orally...
...l'm sure we can arrange
that he can have it some other way.
RATCHED: But I don't think you'd like it,
Mr. McMurphy.
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?
Give it to me.
RATCHED: Good.
Very good!
Yummy!
PILBOW: Mr. Harding?
Merci.
Tell me, lover-boy...
...why didn't you tell her to go fuck herself?
[McMurphy makes blowing sounds,
group laughs]
HARDING: Jesus Christ.
Funny, huh? That's funny, huh?
You know that wasn't very smart.
She could have seen that.
Oh, yeah. Woo...woo!
God Almighty,
she's got you guys coming and going.
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?
HARDING: No, I thought
you were the champ.
You want to bet?
Bet on what?
One week.
I bet in one week I can put a bug
so far up her ass...
...she won't know whether to shit
or wind her wrist watch.
McMURPHY: What do you say to that?
Want to bet? Do you want to bet?
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?
You want to bet? Bet a buck. One buck.
TABER: I'll bet.
McMURPHY: Tabes in, one buck. Solid.
[Skipped item nr. 517]
RATCHED: Last time we were discussing...
...Mr. Harding and the problem
with his wife...
...and I think we were making
a lot of progress.
So who would like to begin today?
Mr. McMurphy?
I've been thinking about
what you said about...
[Clears his throat]
...you know, getting things off your chest.
Well, there's a couple of things
that I'd like to get off my chest.
Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy.
Go ahead.
McMURPHY: Today, as you may
or may not know, it doesn't matter...
...is the opening of the World Series.
What I'd like to suggest is that
we change the work detail tonight...
...so that we can watch the ball game.
RATCHED: Well, Mr. McMurphy,
what you're asking...
...is that we change
a very carefully worked out schedule.
A little change never hurt, huh?
A little variety?
RATCHED: Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.
Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.
Change it now,
and they might find it very disturbing.
Fuck the schedule! They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched.
Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.
RATCHED: How would it be
if we had a vote...
...and let the majority rule?
Great. Let's vote on it.
So, all those in favor raise your hands.
Okay, guys, come on.
McMURPHY: Put your hands up.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to watch the World Series?
Get your hands up.
It can do you some good...
...to get some exercise,
putting your arms up in the air.
That's it. Come on, let's...
What is this crap?
I watch the Series.
I haven't missed the Series in years.
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler
they run it there or they'll have a riot.
McMURPHY: What's the matter with
you guys? Come on, be good Americans!
RATCHED: Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes, and...
...that's not enough
to change the ward policy.
RATCHED: I'm sorry.
HARDING: My turn. Okay, hot dice.
HARDING: I want a ten to go...
...'cause I need cash.
I want to get to Mediterranean Avenue.
Big ten! Perfect.
HARDING: Two fives.
[Harding counting]
HARDING: What are you doing?
MARTINl: Hotel.
-You do not have a hotel there.
-Hotel.
For the third time...
...you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk.
MARTINl: Hotel.
HARDING: It costs $1,000
and four green houses...
Hotel.
-...to put a hotel on Boardwalk.
-Hotel.
TABER: Play the game
and knock off the bullshit.
Play the game, Harding.
What are you talking about?
I am playing the game.
-Play the game!
-I ain't doing anything to you!
-What bullshit?
-Your bullshit!
-What about your bullshit?
-Play the game!
HARDING: You keep your hands off me!
TABER: Play the game!
HARDING:
I've had enough bullshit out of you!
-Play the game.
-What the fuck are you picking on me for?
TABER: Play the game, Harding.
HARDING: I'm trying to ignore you, see?
TABER: Just play the game.
Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch!
HARDING: Keep your hands off me!
You hear me?
-Come on, come on.
-I can be pushed just so far, see!
TABER: Play the game.
HARDING: You touch me once more.
Just touch me once more!
Just once more, huh? Just once more!
HARDING: Just touch me once more!
TABER: Play the game, Harding!
HARDING: Just touch me once more!
HARDING: Holy Jesus!
[Shouts and laughter]
Is that what your schedule
does for you, Hard-on?
Damn lunatic!
I don't know what you're talking about.
No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?
'Cause I'm going downtown
to watch the World Series, anyway.
McMURPHY:
Anybody want to come with me?
I do, Mac. I want to go with you!
McMURPHY: Ches, all right. Anybody else?
-Where?
-Any bar downtown.
BILLY: Mac, you can't...
...can't get out of here.
Anybody want to bet?
Chicken shits!
SEFELT: Maybe he'll just show
Nurse Ratched his big thing...
...and she'll open the door for him.
[All chuckle]
Yeah, maybe I will...
...and then maybe I'll use your
thick skull and knock a hole in the wall.
Sefelt, see?
[Frederickson laughs]
Why? My head would squash
like an eggplant.
[All laugh]
Fuck Sefelt's head,
I don't need Sefelt's head!
I'll take this fucking thing,
and put it through the window...
...and me and Cheswick will go out
through the hall...
...downtown, sit down in a bar,
wet our whistles...
...and watch the ball game.
And that's the bet.
Now, does anybody want any of it?
You're going to lift that thing?
Yeah! That's right.
I'll bet a buck.
Taber, $1.
I bet a dime.
Mac, you can't...
...can't lift that thing.
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?
I'll bet $25!
$25, Hard-on!
Mac, nobody could ever lift that thing.
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.
You know what I mean?
McMURPHY: All right.
All right.
[Groans]
HARDING: Giving up?
[Breathes heavily]
No! Just warming up.
Warming up.
This will be the one.
McMURPHY: All right, baby.
[Grunts and groans]
[Straining sounds]
[Breathes heavily]
McMURPHY: But I tried, didn't I?
Goddamn it!
At least I did that.
[Slamming sounds]
RADIO ANNOUNCER: And on the mound,
the left-hander, Al Downing.
The two pitchers still warming up,
right down below us.
The second game of
the 1963 World Series...
...is being brought to you
from Yankee Stadium.
RATCHED: Did you tell the girl
how you felt about her?
I went over to her house...
...one Sunday afternoon and...
BILLY: ...and I brought her some flowers...
BILLY: ...and I said, I said...
...Celia, will you...
BILLY: ...marry me?
[Frederickson and Sefelt laugh]
[All laugh]
Billy?
Why did you want to marry her?
Well, I was in love with her.
Your mother told me
that you never told her about it.
RATCHED: Billy?
Why didn't you tell her about it?
RATCHED: Billy?
Wasn't that the first time
you tried to commit suicide?
Oh, my God!
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
Miss Ratched...
...l'd like to ask you a question, please.
Go ahead.
Okay...
You know, if...
...Billy doesn't feel like talking...
...I mean, why are you pressing him?
Why can't we go on to some new business?
The business of this meeting,
Mr. Cheswick...
...is therapy.
CHESWICK: Oh...
You know, I don't understand this,
Miss Ratched...
...because I don't...
CHESWICK: Mr. McMurphy...
He said something yesterday
about a World Series.
A baseball game?
CHESWICK: You know, and I've never been
to a baseball game and...
...I think I'd like to see one.
That would be good therapy, too,
wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?
I thought we'd decided that issue.
I don't think so, because, I mean...
...we discussed that yesterday...
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?
That's right, Ches, and we want
a new vote on it, don't we?
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?
Yeah.
It'd satisfy me.
There's a vote before the group.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule,
please raise your hand.
McMURPHY: Okay, I want to see the hands.
Come on!
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?
All right. That's it!
I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.
She only counts nine. Only nine!
It's a landslide.
There are 18 patients
on this ward, Mr. McMurphy...
...and you have to have a majority
to change ward policy.
RATCHED: So you gentlemen
can put your hands down.
McMURPHY: Are you trying to tell me
that you're gonna count these?
These poor sons of bitches,
they don't know what we're talking about.
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.
These men are members of the ward,
just as you are.
[Sighs]
All right. All I need is one vote, right?
McMURPHY: Right?
All right.
McMURPHY: Okay.
McMURPHY:
Want to watch the World Series?
This could be a big moment for you.
You want to watch a baseball game?
You want to watch baseball?
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.
McMURPHY: What do you say?
PATIENT: I gave it all to her.
Sorry.
McMURPHY: Bancini, old horse.
What do you say?
You want to watch the ball game on TV?
Want to watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?
What do you say, pal? You're tired?
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?
I'm tired. Awfully tired.
Okay. All right.
McMURPHY: What about you, pal?
All we need's one vote. Just one vote.
Just your one vote. That's all we need.
Just raise your hand up and your buddies
can watch the baseball game.
General, you remember, don't you?
October, the banner, the stars...
[Sings] "Oh, say can you..."
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen.
[Both sing] "By the dawn's early light..."
McMURPHY: Just raise your hand up.
What about you pal, huh?
Want to watch the ball game?
Want to watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your...
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.
McMURPHY: For Christ's sake,
isn't there one of you fucking maniacs...
...that knows what I'm talking about?
Mr. McMurphy?
The meeting is adjourned.
Just wait a minute, will you?
Just one minute?
You can bring the subject up
again tomorrow.
All right, Chief...
...you're our last chance. What do you say?
Just raise your hand up.
McMURPHY: That's all we need
from you today, Chief.
Just raise your hand up one time.
Show her that you can do it.
Show her that you can still do it.
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?
Come on, there's got to be one guy here
that's not a total fucking nut!
Mac?
McMURPHY: Chief! The Chief!
Aah...!
McMURPHY: Nurse Ratched?
Nurse Ratched, look!
Look. The Chief put his hand up.
The Chief put his hand up. Look, he voted.
McMURPHY: Would you please turn
the television set on?
The Chief has got his hand up, right there.
The Chief voted. Now...
...will you please turn the television set on?
RATCHED: Mr. McMurphy...
...the meeting was adjourned,
and the vote was closed.
But the vote was ten to eight.
The Chief, he's got his hand up! Look!
No, Mr. McMurphy.
When the meeting was adjourned,
the vote was nine to nine.
Come on, you're not going to say that now!
You're not going to say that now!
You're going to pull that henhouse shit,
now, when the vote...
The Chief just voted! It was ten to nine!
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!
WARREN: Cheswick...
CHESWICK: I want to watch television.
WARREN: No, you have a work assignment.
[Soft dramatic instrumental music,
background]
Koufax.
McMURPHY: Koufax kicks. He delivers.
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.
Richardson's rounding first!
He's going for second!
The ball's in to deep right center!
Davidson, over in the corner,
cuts the ball off!
Here comes the throw.
Richardson's around the dirt!
He slides, he's in there.
He's safe! It's a double!
He's in there, Martini!
Look at Richardson, he's on second base.
Koufax is in big fucking trouble!
Big trouble, baby!
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter!
Tresh looks in. Koufax...
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro!
He kicks once, he pumps...
It's a strike! Koufax's curve ball is
snapping off like a fucking firecracker.
Here he comes with the next pitch.
Tresh swings!
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!
[All cheer]
It's going! It's gone!
[All cheer]
Somebody give me a fucking wiener
before I die.
[Laughter and cheers]
McMURPHY: It's the great Mickey Mantle,
now! Here comes the pitch!
Mantle swings!
It's a fucking home run!
Gentlemen, stop this.
Stop this immediately.
[Cheering continues]
Do you like it here?
That fucking nurse, man!
What do you mean, sir?
She...
She ain't honest.
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses
we've got in this institution.
McMURPHY: Ha...!
Well, I don't want to break up
the meeting or nothing...
...but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, Doc?
How do you mean that?
She likes a rigged game,
you know what I mean?
Well, you know,
I've been observing you here now...
...for the last four weeks...
...and I don't see any evidence
of mental illness, at all.
I think that you've been trying to put us on,
all this time.
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.
[Tapping]
You know what I mean? Is that it?
Is that crazy enough for you?
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Christ!
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss"?
Yeah.
Does that mean something to you?
Uh...
McMURPHY: It's the same as "Don't wash
your dirty underwear in public."
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?
[McMurphy laughs]
McMURPHY: Well that, sort of, has
always meant...
...it's hard for something to grow
on something that's moving.
How did you feel about
what happened yesterday?
I wanted to kill... I mean...
[Cackles]
[McMurphy clears his throat]
Do you gentlemen have
any more questions?
I don't have any more, but perhaps you do.
Do you have a question, McMurphy?
Where do you suppose she lives?
[Door rattles]
Chief, come on with me.
McMURPHY:
We'll show these guys who's nuts.
All right, wait.
Stand right here.
McMURPHY: All right. Grab the fence.
Grab the fence here.
Right here, Chief. Strong!
Strong, like this, here.
McMURPHY: That's it. All right.
Okay. Up.
That's it.
McMURPHY: All right, you got it?
McMURPHY: All right, push!
[Grunts]
WARREN: Come on, Bob!
Where are you going?
McMURPHY: Don't breathe on me, Club.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
WARREN: Come on, you guys.
Get the lead out, huh?
[Door rattles]
[Engine revs]
WARREN:
Hey, what the hell's going on here?
FREDERICKSON: Wait a minute!
HARDING: Hold it!
McMURPHY: See how easy it is?
[Tires screech]
[lnstrumental Country and Western tune,
background]
[Dog barks in distance]
[Candy giggles]
McMURPHY: Boys.
This here is Candy.
McMURPHY: Candy, this is the boys.
[Door squeaks shut]
[Engine revs]
Hi.
You all crazy?
[Tires squeal]
McMURPHY: Let's go. Down here.
CHESWICK: Isn't this wonderful?
McMURPHY: Down here.
McMURPHY: No problem.
McMURPHY: Right here.
McMURPHY: Come on, we don't want
to be late for our first day out.
McMURPHY: Hello!
McMURPHY: Come on, will you?
What are you standing around for?
McMURPHY: Get on board.
Give them these.
CAPTAIN: Hey, wait a minute!
What the heck is going on here?
CAPTAIN: What are you doing on this boat?
We're going fishing.
CAPTAIN: No, you're not going fishing.
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.
Oh, yeah, on this boat. Ask Captain Block.
-Captain Block?
-Captain Block. Yes, that's right.
Who are you?
We're from the...
...State Mental Institution...
This is Dr. Cheswick...
...Dr. Taber, Dr. Fredrickson...
...Dr. Scanlon.
The famous Dr. Scanlon.
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...
...Dr. Martini, and...
...Dr. Sefelt.
How about you? Who are you?
I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.
Wait, wait... Wait one second.
McMURPHY: You don't understand.
We chartered the boat.
We're going to go fishing.
And that's all there is to it.
You better quit on this.
They'll throw you in the can again,
you know?
No, they won't. We're nuts!
[Cackles]
They'll just take us back
to the feeb farm, see?
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.
Tabes, you're at the bow.
SEFELT: This one?
That one! The one at your feet.
[Engine rumbles]
McMURPHY: Get back on! Jesus!
[McMurphy chuckles]
McMURPHY: Tabes!
[Hawaiian slide guitar plays, background]
Come here, quick!
Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac!
Take it easy, Charlie.
Have you ever driven one of these things?
-Driven one of...
-Yeah.
No, Mac.
Well, it's a lot of fun.
Come on over here.
Put your hands on the wheel.
McMURPHY: Put your hands on.
CHESWICK: I've never done this.
McMURPHY: Put your hands on the wheel
so you don't fall down. All right.
Just hold it steady right there, like that.
-Steady?
-Steady, yeah.
Now just go straight.
-Straight as an arrow, Charlie.
-Straight, Mac?
-Just straight. That's right.
-But, Mac...
Mac, this thing ain't too steady.
Mac!
CHESWICK: Where are we going, Mac?
McMURPHY: Straight.
McMURPHY: Just go on!
McMURPHY: This is the bait.
McMURPHY: Little fishes.
MARTINl: Dead fishes.
McMURPHY: [Laughing] That's right.
McMURPHY: Now what are we going to do
with these little fishes?
MARTINl: Catch big fishes.
McMURPHY: That's right.
That's right, Mr. Martini.
McMURPHY: Hooks.
McMURPHY: Hooks.
McMURPHY: Now, hold on to your hooks...
...'cause here are the fishes.
McMURPHY: Tabes.
McMURPHY: Get a fish here.
There, for you, Martini.
McMURPHY: All right, now we,
each one of us has got a fish.
What are you laughing at, Martini?
You're not an idiot, huh?
McMURPHY: You're not a goddamn
looney now, boy, you're a fisherman.
[McMurphy chuckles]
Now, take your bottom hook.
You got it?
You take it...
...and you...
McMURPHY: ...push it all the way through.
Like that.
McMURPHY: Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes, here.
McMURPHY: Right through here.
MARTINl: In the eye?
McMURPHY: Don't worry about it!
He's dead, Martini.
Jesus Christ, just put it
through his eyeball, here.
That's it.
Crunch it right through.
All right. Now you got it, see?
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a little loop.
That's very good.
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson!
Very good eye work.
Good eye work.
That little devil's gonna
not even feel the sting, is he, boy?
McMURPHY: That son of a gun
is going to bite on you, isn't he?
You got beautiful hair.
Thank you.
And you got...
...beautiful eyes.
Thank you.
Billy, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?
Um...um...yeah...yeah...
They do.
McMURPHY:
Now, come on with me, over here.
I'm gonna give each
and every one of you a rod.
[McMurphy chuckles]
All right.
McMURPHY: Here's your poles.
[Singing] "I'm Popeye, the sailor man..."
McMURPHY: Now, just keep watching
tip here. If you get a strike, let me know.
Understand?
Come on, Candy. Just keep fishing, guys!
McMURPHY: Don't call me
unless you get something really big...
...you can't handle yourselves.
McMURPHY: Keep on fishing!
McMURPHY: That's right.
[McMurphy chuckles]
[Hawaiian slide guitar plays, background]
Mac...
CHESWICK: Mac...
CHESWICK: Hey!
Where is everybody?
[Engine hums]
CHESWICK: Hey!
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you to...
McMURPHY: ...steer that boat straight!
TABER: Mac!
TABER: Fish! Help, help!
McMURPHY: Goddamn it, he's got a fish.
Hold it! Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it!
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there in front!
Tabes, I got it, Tabes!
McMURPHY: Get up, Tabes,
I'll get it for you!
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up there!
I got it!
McMURPHY: I got it! Give it to me!
CHESWICK: Hey, Harding,
I'm the skipper of this boat.
HARDING: Shut up!
He said to go straight out as an arrow.
You're not going straight, you're kind of...
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it!
-lt's my duty!
-Chessy, stop it!
McMURPHY: No, you son of a bitch!
All right, Martini.
All right, take him over!
Take him over!
That's it! Now play them, boys!
You sons of bitches!
McMURPHY: Keep it straight!
Come back this way!
[Boat engine hums,
helicopter propellers pelt overhead]
[Seagulls crying]
McMURPHY: Home safe and sound.
Didn't lose a nut!
Beats bowling, you know what I mean?
SEFELT: We caught it, look!
McMURPHY:
They're gonna be trolling this place...
...for six months looking for dead bodies!
Woo!
I think he's dangerous.
He's not crazy...
...but he's dangerous.
You don't think he's crazy?
GILMAN: No, he's not crazy.
PHILLIPS: Dr. Songee?
I don't think he's overly psychotic.
But I still think he's quite sick.
PHILLIPS: Do you think he's dangerous?
SONGEE: Absolutely so.
PHILLIPS: Well, John, what do you want
to do with him?
Well...
I think we've had our turn.
I'd like to send him back
to the work farm, frankly.
[Ratched sighs]
PHILLIPS: Is there anybody that you have...
...on your staff, that could...
...relate to him? Maybe understand him.
Help him out with some of these problems?
The funny thing is that
the person that he's the closest to...
...is the one he dislikes the most.
That's you, Mildred.
RATCHED: Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,
if we send him back to Pendleton or...
...we send him up to Disturbed...
...it's just one more way of passing on
our problem to somebody else.
You know, we don't like to do that.
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.
I think we can help him.
[Spivey sighs]
[Skipped item nr. 1080]
McMURPHY: All right.
Chief, Chief, come on.
Come with me, huh?
Chief, this is the spot.
Right there is the spot. Remember?
Raise the hands, in the basket.
McMURPHY: That's it. Raise the hands up.
McMURPHY: All right! Let's have a little
ball from you nuts in here! Here we go!
All right! Let's play some ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves!
WASHINGTON: Hey, Mac, Mac.
Time, time, time.
You've got six men on the court.
Harding, out of the ball game.
Hey, why me?
McMURPHY: Because I'm the coach.
I'll put you in later.
HARDING: I don't trust you.
BILLY: Mac.
I'll go.
McMURPHY: Okay, good boy, Billy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?
McMURPHY: Let's play ball.
Harding, break over there.
McMURPHY: All right, Martini,
get it back. Back!
I'm in the open! What are you doing?
You threw the goddamn ball into the fence!
Christ Almighty, you threw
the ball into the fence!
There's nobody there! We're playing ball!
All right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here!
McMURPHY: For Christ's sake!
HARDING: Hey, Mac, I'm open!
McMURPHY: Harding, give it back.
Back to me!
I'm open. Harding, give me the ball.
McMURPHY:
Stop dribbling the goddamn ball!
HARDING: I got it!
McMURPHY: Harding, over here.
McMURPHY: Oh, for Christ's sake.
I'm standing...
HARDING: You were covered!
McMURPHY: I was open!
McMURPHY: Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the...
I was open. Give me the ball.
MARTINl: You were covered, Mac.
I wasn't covered. Somebody get back!
Give it to me! Give it to me!
McMURPHY: Chief! Thatta baby, put it in!
[Cheering]
McMURPHY: Get down there!
[McMurphy whistles]
McMURPHY: Get down there, Chief!
All right, all right.
McMURPHY: Get around, Chief!
[Players protesting]
McMURPHY: No, no, no.
Get down there, Chief!
The ball's in play! Ball's in play!
PLA YERS: That's bullshit!
McMURPHY: Ball's in play.
Oh, fuck that shit! You've got to be crazy.
WASHINGTON: Man, that doesn't go!
Get that ball in and play!
McMURPHY: Come on, Chief! Put it in!
[Cheering]
What a ball club!
WASHINGTON: McMurphy, get off the side.
WASHINGTON: Come on, move it, man!
McMURPHY: Hey, damn it!
Quick! Come on, go ahead.
WASHINGTON: Go ahead.
WASHINGTON: Go ahead.
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what I mean?
WASHINGTON:
By the time you get out of here...
...you'll be too old to even get it up.
Sixty-eight days, buddy.
Sixty-eight days.
What the fuck you talking about, 68 days!
That's in jail, sucker.
You still don't know where you're at?
Yeah, where am I at, Washington?
With us, baby, you're with us.
And you're gonna stay with us
until we let you go.
Do you want to say something
to the group, Mr. McMurphy?
Well...
[Clears his throat]
Yeah...
McMURPHY: I'd like to know why none
of the guys never told me that you...
...Miss Ratched...
...and the doctors could keep me here till
you're good and ready to turn me loose.
McMURPHY: That's what I'd like to know.
Fine, Randall, that's a good start.
Would anyone care
to answer Mr. McMurphy?
HARDING: Answer what?
You heard me, Harding.
You let me go on hassling
Nurse Ratched here...
...knowing how much I had to lose
and you never told me nothing!
Now, Mac, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I didn't know anything
about how much...
McMURPHY: Shit!
HARDING: Wait a minute. Listen.
HARDING: Now, look...
I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.
HARDING: I don't have to stay here.
I mean, I can go home anytime I want.
You can go home anytime you want?
HARDING: That's it.
McMURPHY: You're bullshitting me!
McMURPHY: He's bullshitting me, right?
No, Randall, he's telling you the truth.
RATCHED: As a matter of fact, there are
very few men here who are committed.
There's Mr. Bromden.
RATCHED: Mr. Taber.
Some of the chronics, and you.
-Cheswick?
-Hmm?
You're voluntary?
Mm-hmm.
McMURPHY: Scanlon?
Billy, for Christ's sake,
you must be committed, right?
No, no, no.
You're just a young kid!
What are you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...
...bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.
What are you doing here, for Christ's sake?
McMURPHY: What's so funny about that?
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing
but complain about how you can't...
...stand it in this place, and then
you haven't got the guts to walk out?
What do you think you are,
for Christ's sake? Crazy or something?
[Martini laughs]
Well, you're not. You're not!
You're no crazier than the average asshole
walking around on the streets.
And that's it.
McMURPHY: Jesus Christ, I can't believe it!
Those are very challenging observations
you made, Randall.
I'm sure some of the men
would like to comment.
Mr. Scanlon?
I want to know why the dorm is locked
in the daytime and on weekends.
[McMurphy sighs]
I would like to know about our cigarettes.
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick,
and wait your turn.
Go ahead, sit down!
To answer your question
about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...
RATCHED: You know very well...
...that if we left the door open, you'd just
go right back to bed after breakfast.
Am I right?
So what?
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?
McMURPHY: For Christ's sake!
McMURPHY: Cigarettes!
Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times...
...that time spent in the company of others
is very therapeutic.
While time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.
You remember that, don't you?
Do you mean to say...
...it's sick to want to be off by yourself?
CHESWICK: Miss Ratched?
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down!
CHESWICK: I want to know about...
RATCHED: Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.
I want to...
Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?
It's my last one.
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?
HARDING: Look, I'm not running
a charity ward, see?
Come on!
CHESWICK:
Look, I don't want his cigarettes.
And I don't want his, or his, or his...
...or his, or his, or his...
Or even yours.
Do you understand that?
CHESWICK: I want my cigarettes,
Miss Ratched!
I want my cigarettes!
I want mine, Miss Ratched!
CHESWICK: What gives you
the damn right...
...to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk...
...and to squeeze out a pack
only when you feel like it, huh?
CHESWICK: Miss Ratched!
McMURPHY: Mr. Harding!
[Outburst of giggles, background]
Oh, I'm sorry.
RATCHED: You surprise me.
HARDING: I lost my head. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.
I didn't mean to.
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.
It's all right.
CHESWICK: Miss Ratched!
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
I asked you a question!
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...
...and I will answer your question
as soon as you've calmed down.
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?
CHESWICK: I'm calm.
RATCHED: Good.
Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy...
...has been running
a small gambling casino in our tub room.
RATCHED: Now, most of you lost
all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...
...not to mention a tidy sum of money
to Mr. McMurphy.
RATCHED: And that's why...
...your tub room privileges
have been suspended...
...and your cigarettes have been rationed.
Mr. Martini?
How are we going to win our money back?
[McMurphy chuckles]
You're not going to win
your money back, Mr. Martini.
RATCHED: That's all over.
If you had obeyed the rules
in the first place...
...you wouldn't have lost your money.

Sit down, gentlemen!
Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down!
[Taber continues yelling]
CHESWICK: Rules?
Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched!
Sit down, will you, Cheswick!
I want you to know something
right here and now, Miss Ratched!
I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid!
RATCHED: You sit down!
CHESWICK: Where you're going to have
cigarettes kept from me like cookies...
And I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?
That's right! Will you sit down!
No, I won't! I won't!
I want something done!

He's going to be all right!
[Grunting and groaning]

Yeah, okay.
NURSE: How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?
McMURPHY: I do real fine.
ATTENDANT: I know you didn't do
anything wrong. Just sit down.
We're not going to hurt you.
Sit down, right here.
That's it.
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick.
He's a little upset.
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.
-You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.

Would you keep an eye on these three?

NURSE ITSU:
Would you please take these, gentlemen?
McMURPHY: He can't hear nothing.

[Door closes]
Want some gum?
Thank you.
Juicy Fruit.
You sly son of a bitch, Chief.
[Foot slams]
Can you hear me, too?
Yeah, you bet!
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief!
And they all, they all think
you're deaf and dumb.
Jesus Christ!
[McMurphy laughs]
You fooled them, Chief.
You fooled them. You fooled them all!
Goddamn you!
What are we doing in here, Chief?
What's us, two guys,
doing in this fucking place?
Let's get out of here.
Out.
Canada?
Canada.
We'll be there before these
sons of bitches know what hit 'em.
Listen to Randall on this one.
[Footsteps]
Mr. McMurphy?
ITSU: Please follow me.
You and me, Chief.
Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy.
I'll be fine.
McMURPHY: Aah...
ATTENDANT: Would you sit up, please?
McMURPHY: I'd love to.
ATTENDANT: Thatta boy.
There might be a little fluid in them boots,
you know what I mean, boys?
McMURPHY: Just a little leak.
A light shine, boys, and...
...send the specimen to Nurse Ratched.
[Breathes heavily, chuckles]
ITSU: All right, out with your gum.
Out with your gum.
DOCTOR: Okay, this won't hurt,
and it'll be over in just a moment.
McMURPHY: What's that?
ITSU: Conductant.
A little dab will do you.
Right, Mr. Jackson?
Open your mouth.
What's that?
ITSU: This'll keep you
from biting your tongue.
Now just bite down on it.
That's right. Just bite down.
Now, bite down on it.

RATCHED: Now, one big breath.
[All breathe deeply]
RATCHED: Very good.
RATCHED: Gentlemen, I'd like
to begin today. It shouldn't take too long.
[Shuffling of papers]
Jim?
RATCHED: It's been brought
to my attention...
...that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson
your medication.
Is that true?
SEFELT: No, ma'am.
RATCHED: Jim?
Are you giving your medication
to Mr. Fredrickson...
...or are you not?
[Wobbling footsteps]
[Laughs]
How about it, you creeps,
you lunatics, mental defectives.
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall,
back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo.
[All laugh]
McMURPHY: Look at the faces on you!
Look at you!
The feeb's brigade, you ding-a-lings!
The mental defective league in formation.
How are you, Nurse Ratched?
I'm happy to be back.
We're happy to have you back, Randall.
Thank you.
McMURPHY: Would you like to rest today,
or would you like to join the group?
I'd love to join the group...
I'd like...
I'm proud to join the group, Mildred.
[McMurphy clears his throat]
BILLY: How's it going, Mac?
Perfect, Billy Boy, absolutely perfect.
McMURPHY: They were giving me
10,000 watts a day, you know, and I'm...
...hot to trot.
The next woman who takes me on
will light up like a pinball machine...
...and pay off in silver dollars!
[All chuckle]
That's an amusing thought, Randall...
...but when you came in
we were talking to Jim.
He has a problem with his medication...
...and we'd like to get back to that.
Oh, I don't...I don't mind at all,
Nurse Ratched, I'm...
...as gentle as a puppy dog and...
Please proceed. Thank you.

Chief...
Chief, I can't take it no more.
I gotta get out of here.
I can't. I just can't.
It's easier than you think, Chief.
For you, maybe.
You're a lot bigger than me.
[McMurphy chuckles]
Why, Chief, you're about as big
as a goddamn tree trunk.
CHIEF: My poppa's real big.
He did like he pleased.
That's why everybody worked on him.
The last time I've seen my father
he was blind in the cedars from drinking.
And every time he put
the bottle to his mouth...
...he don't suck out of it.
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so...
...wrinkled and yellow,
even the dogs don't know him.
Killed him, huh?
I'm not saying they killed him.
They just worked on him,
the way they're working on you.
There they are, Chief.
McMURPHY: There they are. They're here.
[Whispers] Over here. That's it!
McMurphy, stop all this Holy Roller shit...
...and get your ass back in bed.
Do you understand?
Well...
My prayers have been answered, Turkle.
Come on and see.
McMURPHY: You'd take $20...
...to get down on your knees and pray,
wouldn't you, Turkle?
No, it don't send me, don't send me.
-lt don't?
-Don't do nothing to me, no.
Well, you know there'll be more.
I mean, they'll be bringing
a couple of bottles with them, and...
TURKLE: You're getting closer, brother.
You're getting closer, but...
...they're going to be sharing
more than just bottles, ain't they?
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, sure.
-I know what you mean.
-Understand what I mean?
Yeah, I understand what you mean.
-Anything you say, Turkle.
-I'm on my knees, brother.
-I'm on my knees.
-Yeah, all right, all right.
[Metallic clanking]
McMURPHY:
Let me just give them a hand here.
TURKLE: I appreciate that.
WOMEN: Hi.
TURKLE: Ladies!
McMURPHY: Oh, thank you. I believe
this is your department, Mr. Turkle.
ROSE: Hi, there! Give me a hand.
McMURPHY: How're you doing?
McMURPHY: Love to give you a hand.
TURKLE: Keep it down. Keep it down.
ROSE: I split my pants.
TURKLE: Keep it down!
McMURPHY: Give it to me. Give it to me.
TURKLE: You got to keep it down!
ROSE: Hi.
CANDY: This looks like my high school.
ROSE: Oh, hey, I take that.
ROSE: The barber chair.
TURKLE: You may have it.
ROSE: It is mine, mine.
TURKLE: You can have it.
You can have it, honey.
ROSE: Take a load of these tubs.
CANDY: It's a real nice place you got here.
Hey, can I take a bath?
Sure, you can take a bath. Sure.
Just don't drown your pretty little self.
You know...
...Rose was married to a maniac once,
up in Beaverton.
Oh, really, miss?
What seemed to be the problem?
Oh, nothing, he used to put frogs
in my bra all the time.
[All laugh and giggle]
Very interesting.
Very interesting.
Rose is very interested in hospitals,
and hospital facilities.
-I am?
-Yes. Oh, yes, you are.
-I'm going to take Miss Candy...
-Where you going?
I'm gonna take Candy for a stroll.
I got you, I got you.
-But just don't make too much noise.
-Oh, no, not a peep, not a peep.

Get my ass really fired?
Come on, get your ass out of here.
Come on.
McMURPHY: We're just having a party.
TURKLE: Party, my ass!
This ain't no nightclub, this is a hospital!
Man, this is my fucking job!
I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job!
TURKLE: Oh, shit! The supervisor!
Get your asses back in there.
Come on. Come on there!

Good. Come on.

Why doesn't he answer?
TABER: He's jerking off somewhere.
TURKLE: Ain't nobody jerking off nowhere,

McMURPHY: Turkle, what the fuck are you
doing here? Go out and talk to her!
TURKLE: Doing the same fucking thing
you're doing in here, hiding!
Yes, ma'am?
Is everything all right, Mr. Turkle?
Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am.

awfully lonesome at night.
You understand what I mean, don't you?

McMURPHY: Why don't you
come with us, then?
Think I don't want to?
Well, come on then, let's go.
BILLY: Well, it's not that easy.
I'm not ready yet.
McMURPHY: Tell you what we'll do...
When I get to Canada,
I'll write you a postcard...
...and I'll put my address on it.
That way when you're ready, you'll...
...you'll know where to go.
McMURPHY: What do you say?

BILLY: Mac?
Is she going with you?
Candy?
McMURPHY: Yeah, she'll be there

Are you going to marry her?
No, we're just good friends.
Why?
Nothing.
Don't "nothing" me, all right? What is it?
It's too late.
Do you want a date with her?
Jesus, I must be crazy
to be in a looney bin like this!
Date, huh?
Well, it'll have to be a fast date,
I'll tell you that.
Not now!
McMURPHY: Not now?
When, then?
When I have a free weekend.
You're busy right now, are you?
You've got something to do right now?
-You've got something to do?
-No.
Good, then don't talk to me about
when you're ready. Yeah.
-Ready and everything like that.

Go get him, will you?
Go get him. Get him out of there.
