[woman moaning]
[conversing in Japanese]
Little Darc has been busy.
Mr. Tagawa says he's teaching me
a valuable trade.
Mr. Tagawa likes to sit on his fat ass.
As long as he doesn't have to work,
he'll tell you anything.
[woman screaming]
[speaking in Japanese]
Hey, kid.
Reading that comic again?
"Darc."
You want to be a hero, huh?
-[in English] Been working hard?
-I fixed the bench.
You're a good boy, baby.
I got you something.
Open it.
Mom...
it's great.
Thank you!
I love you so much.
[woman groaning]
[woman screaming]
[man speaking Japanese]
You will...
do...
as...
I...
say!
[young Jake shouting]
[man grunts]
[young Jake gasping]
[speaking in Japanese]
You little shit!
[young Jake screaming]
[man shouts]
-[woman panting]
-[man groans]
Mom!
[man continues to groan]
[alarm blaring]
[gate closes]
[in English] Early release.
This was you?
Yeah.
The answer is still no.
Yeah, well, it's not the agency asking.
It's me, personally.
They got my daughter.
KogaKai.
Hear what I said?
-Got a bus to catch.
-They took my daughter.
Hey, do you hear me? Hey!
Fuck.
[speaking in Japanese]
Been playing kachi-kachi?
What's this card?
Juu
The only card adopted from the West
and it is totally worthless
Only until late in the game.
Then it can change everything.
You should spend more time working
and less time gambling.
[in English] Hey.
Could you stop a second?
My daughter's a nurse.
She got nothing to do with them.
All that shit, they got her holed up
three weeks now.
Can you imagine the hell
she's been put through?
'Cause I'm not going away, pal.
I'll stick in your head
like a fucking aneurysm.
It's KogaKai.
What the hell do you think I can do?
Whatever the hell I can't.
You got a whole army of agents.
OK.
So Interpol gets involved now.
And they're looking for her.
Where the hell do you think
we're gonna find her? Tell me.
Sorry, can't help you.
You know I got you an early release.
I'll put you right the fuck back!
[car engine whirring]
Shit. Darc.
You're... You're--
You're out?
Yeah, no shit.
What'd I tell you about being out here?
Guess I need to teach you another lesson.
[both grunt and groan]
[car tires screeching]
[man] Fuck!
Fuck!
You ain't the fucking cops, man.
Stay out of here, motherfucker.
[man panting]
Fuck.
[man groaning]
[woman] I keep the deposit.
Comprende, big man?
-[crash]
-[Ivy sighing]
[Ivy] You got to be fucking kidding me!
What are you looking at?
Excuse me?
Do you wanna bring your ass out here
and help me? Or--
Jeez, forget it.
Just bring 'em in here, maybe.
Just leave it, it's fine.
Do you want an award or something?
Hey, neighbor.
Thank you.
[Renee] Daddy. Please. Please don't--
[man] You want to keep her clean?
You know what to do.
[Renee sobbing]
[knock on the door]
Just beer, not a marriage proposal.
Thanks.
Oh, he speaks.
My name is...
Ivana Mulligan.
My friends call me Ivy.
This is the part where you shake my hand.
[Darc sighs]
Jake Walters.
People call me Darc.
Darc.
OK.
Nice to meet you.
[door closes]
When she was five,
she fell off a swing.
She went into a coma.
A few days pass, she opens her eyes,
and she looks at me and she says,
"I'm sorry, Daddy."
Sorry.
You're fit.
You don't need this.
You don't need to do it for my daughter.
You should do it for your mother.
[young Jake] Mom!
[man groans]
Come on, baby.
[man speaking in Japanese]
Get them!
Get fucking both of them!
Move! Out of the way!
[speaking in Japanese]
[man shouts]
[both panting]
[speaking in Japanese]
[men speaking indistinctly]
-[young Jake] Mom!
-[woman] Go!
[people speaking indistinctly]
[young Jake] Mom!
Mom!
[Lafique] She'll get the justice.
I want it stopped.
I want it stopped!
Nobody just walks into the Yakuza.
Kageyama.
Toshio Kageyama.
You recall that face?
[woman screaming]
[woman sobbing]
[young Jake] Mom!
He's the one that ordered the kidnap.
He set it up.
It's his son, the Oyabun.
[young Jake screaming]
[woman] Go, baby, go, go!
[speaking Japanese]
Fucking cunt!
Momma!
[speaking Japanese]
That's enough!
[woman sobbing]
[man grunts]
No!
Small world, huh?
Why'd they take her?
'Cause a bomb took my leg.
I went down, I came back.
They want to own me.
That's why they have her.
This ain't about me, man.
I don't give a shit
about what happens to me.
It's about my daughter.
[people speaking indistinctly]
[car horn blaring]
[speaking in Japanese]
Fucker!
Let go!
[young Jake screams]
Get the police!
[young Jake screaming]
[door opens]
-[door closing]
-[keys clanging]
[banging]
[Ivy in English] For fuck's sake.
Hi. [sighs] Wow!
Almost didn't recognize you.
You really don't clean up half bad.
-Need some help?
-No.
I'm pretty handy with a hammer.
Do you think that this particular shelf
hung its fucking self?
I just... I could...
I could go for a coffee, maybe.
Bye, Ivy.
[door closes]
[siren wailing]
[Lafique] There's a biker named Bronson.
Toshio wants him dead.
But they got him holed up
in town somewhere.
There we go.
Shigeru Kageyama
Toshio's son.
[music playing]
[Lafique] Kind of a stain
on the family name.
The little Shig's going to try
to redeem himself
in his old man's eyes.
Shigeru needs help.
[thunder rumbling]
[men groan and grunt]
You're up.
[man] You know who the fuck I am?
Get off.
[man 2] Yeah, the little asshole
just tried to rip us off.
-[Shigeru] I'll pay you what we agreed on.
-[man] No, the price just doubled.
Fuck you.
Wait, relax, all right.
Fuck.
[man] Who the fuck are you? Hold him.
Who the fuck are you, asshole?
You have any idea who you're fucking with?
-Come on.
-[man] Let's get him, guys.
Stupid motherfucker.
[men groaning and grunting]
Where the fuck is Bronson?
Where the fuck is he?
[groaning and grunting]
[groans]
[man] Ah!
[Shigeru] Who the fuck are you?
Hey, yo, wait.
Hey, that was fucking awesome.
Seriously, man, I owe you.
Let me buy you a drink.
-[Darc] Got somewhere to be.
-[Shigeru] Come on.
Just a drink.
A talk.
You don't like what I say, you walk away.
Keep the cash.
[Shigeru] What were you in for?
[Darc] Which time?
Seriously, what for?
I have a temper.
I don't like idiots.
Not a good combination.
You ever kill anyone?
Not officially.
I'm working on something.
You could be helpful.
You know nothing about me.
You'll be checked out.
But I need someone now. Someone good.
And I know you are that, huh?
Yeah? All right.
-Give me your number.
-Don't have a phone.
Never had a need for one.
[speaking in Japanese]
I'm taking your phone.
[in English] Here's my number.
And delete the rest.
-We haven't discussed payment.
-Don't worry about that.
[breathing heavily]
[sniffles]
Hi, am I interrupting anything?
No I... I exercise when I'm bored.
You must get bored a lot.
I am really busy tonight, so I thought,
sorry, that we could have an early dinner.
But, no funny business, we're just
neighbors. You fucking understand me?
-I fucking do.
-OK.
So, I can tell that...
you're on the aloof end
of the social spectrum.
Which is not a problem for me,
I tend to talk enough for two.
But, the ex-con thing,
that may be an issue.
If you were put in
for abusing women or children then,
I gotta go.
And I'm gonna take my food with me.
Seriously, though, I think
that there's no lower form of life
than abusers of the innocent.
No arguments from me.
OK.
OK, great.
Let's eat.
Going to get some plates, and what else?
Silverware, probably.
No plates.
I guess a corkscrew
is out of the question.
Is out of the question, OK. [sighs]
-Hmm.
-OK, don't worry about it.
I shouldn't have wine, anyways.
If my students caught that on my breath,
half of them would relapse
right there in class.
We just stick to the pizza.
[Ivy sighs]
Hi.
So, what do you do?
Keeps you so busy,
you can't even buy the basics.
[cell phone vibrates]
Sorry.
Yeah?
I know where.
Yeah.
What I do, I gotta do it now.
-That's OK. OK.
-I'm sorry.
We'll just share it later.
I'd like that.
OK.
Well, I'll just...
Have fun doing whatever it is you do.
Four of them. Exit's on the other side.
These assholes killed three of my men.
You carrying?
You know how to use a semi, right?
All right.
I... I take the inside.
[loud music playing]
Come on, baby, daddy wants a queen.
Daddy is a queen.
[man] Just fucking deal, Bronson.
I win this hand, I'm next.
Hey, girl, don't worry,
he won't even touch the sides.
[laughing]
[woman sobbing]
[gunshot]
[man shouts]
What the fuck is this?
Go.
[gun loading]
Bronson, it's a Jap!
Come on, you motherfucker!
[grunting]
[straining]
[groans]
[man continues to groan]
Die, Chink.
Hey, I'm Japanese, asshole.
Same fucking difference.
[Shigeru] Up there, that's where he is.
My father.
Emperor Toshio Kageyama.
An important man.
So very important.
[elevator bell dings]
[speaking in Japanese]
Open your files.
As you can see from the chart...
Since coming to the U.S...
Gentlemen, please excuse the intrusion.
I have something you've been
desperately looking for.
[woman crying]
[in English] Momma!
[speaking in Japanese]
For this, your interrupt business?
I thought it was important.
You've been looking for him for weeks.
Finally, I found him.
Me...
and my new friend.
[in English] Jake Walters, my father.
The honorable Toshio Kageyama.
[speaking in Japanese]
You brought a fucking gaijin?
Have you looked into him?
[in English] My father thinks
you're a spy.
I killed three men in front of a witness.
You know any agency
that will condone that?
Wait outside.
[door closes]
[speaking in Japanese]
Where did you find him?
He saved my ass.
And that's not suspicious to you?
He killed in front of me.
Besides, they would never try to get
a white guy inside.
Because we don't expect it
maybe that's exactly what they would do!
This guy is seriously good.
I've never seen anyone like him.
Trust me.
Just this once.
Remember this...
Don't speak about
anything important around him.
Of course.
I only hope he is
as good as you say he is.
I would stake my life on it.
[Shigeru in English] Let's go.
[speaking in Japanese]
Get me the Dragons.
[in English] Fuck, yeah.
This is just the beginning.
Your brawn and my brain,
we're going to build am empire.
[music playing]
[people speaking indistinctly]
If you see anything you like,
she's on the house.
Kind of particular.
Hey, not me.
Have a look around,
I'm sure you'll find something.
[laughing]
[people speaking indistinctly]
Gaijin.
[in English] Is there a problem?
[laughing] Yeah, you.
[both groaning and grunting]
[screaming]
[glass shattering]
[groans]
[shouting and grunting]
[groans]
Shit. You OK, man?
You OK?
[people speaking indistinctly]
-Thanks for the help.
-I couldn't.
It was a test.
As a gaijin,
you'll never be Yakuza.
I'm just here for the money.
Do your job,
and you'll be well rewarded.
I've already done one job.
[speaking in Japanese]
Didn't you pay him?
[sighs]
Huh?
[Toshio speaking in English]
Wait.
You caused a great deal of damage
to my club.
Kanji will drive you home.
-I'll take a cab.
-No.
You work for us.
We'll get you home.
[speaking in Japanese]
Find out everything you can.
This gaijin is hiding something.
[knock on the door]
[in English] Shigeru-san, sent me.
They're waiting to drive me back.
Please, if I don't stay...
I can be very good to you.
Do things that'll take your mind
off your injuries.
Come in. Please.
Have a seat.
Ah! No corkscrew.
Maybe I can help with that.
Wait.
-May I?
-Please.
[sighs] That worked.
You wouldn't happened to have brought
any glasses with you.
Who needs a glass.
[chuckles]
-It's pretty bad.
-You know what?
Perfect with cold pizza.
[Lisa] Those things will kill you.
[breathes out]
You're right.
[sighs]
Why are you here?
Why are you here, Lisa?
I'm not judging.
My mother was in the trade.
She had no choice.
My family borrowed money from Toshio-san.
The business went bad...
-Until the debt's paid off--
-So if you disappear,
so does your family.
-Hmm!
-You need to get some rest.
Wait.
My mother never had any money of her own.
Buy something nice for yourself.
[door closes]
That's my fuckin' pizza.
So what?
-Need more information.
-Hey, I wanna know my daughter's alive.
That's the problem with today's cops.
No trust in the public.
[speaking in Japanese]
[Renee in English] Daddy?
Daddy?
-Renee? Baby, listen to me. Listen to me!
-[Renee] Daddy!
Need to know who this is.
I'll text you a copy.
You better wrap your head around this.
'Cause if one thing happens to her,
I'm coming for you! You hear me?
[sniffing]
So, she hit the spot.
The bitch I sent you?
I saw how you looked at her.
Seems all you white fuckers
like a bit of yellow.
[Darc] But most of the girls
in the club were white.
Where do they come from?
All over the world, buddy.
Why do you think we got into
the shipping business?
-Where do you keep them all?
-Why are you asking?
You planning on starting out on your own?
What do you think?
I think you're smart enough to know
what would happen to you if you tried.
[car engine whirring]
There. Pull over.
So, what do these guys owe you?
It's not a lot of money.
It's the disrespect.
You know, China people not paying
sets a bad example.
Do you what Japanese really like?
Sushi and golf.
[glass shatters]
Wait, wait, please!
We didn't have a choice. We didn't--
[people gasp]
Everyone has a choice.
-They make us, they make us!
-Who made you?
Triple Eight triad!
Triple Eight triad!
They said they would take it over.
And you believed them.
-Fucking Chinese!
-The register!
-Take it. Whatever we have is yours!
-Damn straight, old woman.
[Shigeru] This will always be
KogaKai territory, granny.
Remember that.
Apologies for the interruption, folks.
Enjoy your meals.
Looks like we got to go hunting.
Time to visit Lee at the Triple Eight.
[machine whirring]
Hey! Hey!
[background conversation on TV]
[thud]
[groaning]
[gunshots]
[groans]
[shouts]
[screaming]
Fucking Chinese!
Help!
Please, I'm unarmed.
No witnesses.
[groaning and grunting]
[women screaming]
Where is Lee?
Where the fuck is Lee?
[banging and screaming]
Relax ladies.
I don't kill women.
Unless they deserve it.
-Do you deserve it?
-No!
There you go then.
Let's go.
Grab everything you can.
Shigeru-san, back in a minute.
[music playing]
[groaning]
Shigeru.
[speaking in Japanese]
Where's your new friend?
Somewhere around here...
He'll be back soon.
[groaning]
[woman sobbing]
[woman gasping]
[man grunting]
[in English] I see you again,
I'll drown you in your own fat.
Drown him in his own fat?
You OK?
Who are you?
What are you really doing here?
I'm looking for someone.
A girl.
Renee Lafique.
She was here.
-I took her food.
-Was?
They moved her a few days ago.
To where?
I don't know.
They've got businesses everywhere.
Shipping yards, motels, private homes.
Think, Lisa.
Maybe someone mentioned something.
I have to find her.
I'll try to find out.
-If she ends up back here, I can call you.
-Be careful.
You too.
They'd pay a lot for this information.
[Darc] If Renee's taken back
to the brothel, she'll call me.
[Lafique] What do you mean? That's it?
That's all you fuckin' got?
Do you understand the longer you're there,
the more of a chance
they find out who you are.
They're asking questions now
for Christ sakes.
Give them what they want.
Be a smart cop, leave out Japan.
Oh, come on, you're supposed to make shit
happen. That's why I got you out. Christ.
You gotta do something, goddamn it!
Do something?
Well, how much longer
do you think we've got?
OK.
Wha... What does that mean? OK.
Time to make shit happen.
[Lafique] That's everything.
What I could find anyway.
You gave me short notice, you know.
You're making excuses?
Well, that makes me suspicious.
No excuses.
Hey, what do you want me to say?
You want me to say he's bad fucking news?
All right.
He's bad fucking news.
[tires screeching]
[groaning]
[people speaking indistinctly]
[man on TV] Couldn't imagine the American
back line hold defense like that.
Vasquez! Yes, yes, he's through.
He's through.
He drops the ball
before he makes the edge.
He's out of the game, how unfortunate.
[grunts]
[grunting and groaning]
[screaming]
[water dripping]
[foot steps approaching]
[groaning]
[Toshio] You motherfucker.
You are so dead.
Stay in here.
[door closes]
[groans]
[gasping]
You!
I fucking knew it.
[speaking in Japanese]
Get help!
You hear me, girl?
Do it and your family debt is clean!
Good offer.
If I were her, I'd take it.
[in English] Who the fuck are you?
Think back.
Japan.
Chiba.
An alley.
Whore.
Her throat,
slit.
I was eight years old.
Darc boy?
I'm gonna kill you Toshio-san.
We both know that.
Unless,
tell me where Renee Lafique is.
Where?
[groaning]
OK. OK.
She's...
Your momma had some good moves.
[groaning and screaming]
[Toshio laughing]
You fucking idiot!
We'd never hide her
in such a public place.
[grunting]
Jake.
You should've left.
I almost did.
They know I'm here.
You can't just leave me.
They'll torture me, I'll tell them
everything and they'll kill me.
Lisa.
Do it.
Do it.
Please.
[knock on the door]
[siren wailing at a distance]
[bang on the door]
Come with us.
That's a big gun.
It's a big world.
They're just business associates.
Well, they're being loud.
I'd like them to go.
Oyabun is on his way from Japan.
Shigeru needs you.
Wait outside.
This gun is getting real heavy, boys.
It might just go off any minute.
You're a taciturn bastard.
The people you associate yourself with,
they speak volumes.
[door closes]
-Where's Shigeru?
-He'll be with us soon.
One more time.
Where'd you get these tattoos?
[speaking in Japanese]
Do it!
[grunts]
[in English] Tell me who sent you, gaijin.
Did Toshio-san find out?
Is that why you killed him?
Hit him!
Harder!
Harder!
[speaking in Japanese]
Do it again!
Get out.
He doesn't work for you
Get out.
Get out of or I'll fucking castrate you!
Who brought him here?
Me.
Who put you in charge?
[in English] Look at his tattoos.
He is not who he says he is.
[speaking in Japanese]
I knew about them!
It's one of the reasons I hired him!
What the fuck do you know?
You were born in America.
I was Toshi's aide.
He was my friend.
He was my father!
And he regretted that every day.
You were my father's pet dog.
Just a translator. Nothing more.
The only reason I don't kill you...
My grandfather will want to know
where you were when my father died!
[in English] Taking you home.
And, Jake,
don't go too far.
You and I have a lot to discuss.
[speaking in Japanese]
What about the whore?
It's strange she was the only one
left alive.
She was knocked out.
She called us as soon as she came round.
Why would she do that if she was involved?
-The gaijin is the--
-Not again.
He has done everything we've asked of him.
For money.
-What if someone offered him more?
-Like fucking who?
Enough.
If the gaijin is innocent
then the attack was carried out
by someone else.
Shigeru.
Find out who and clear his name.
Kanji.
When this is over,
I want to hear about how Toshio died
while you were responsible
for his security.
And both of you,
remember this well.
We are Yakuza.
No individual is more important
than the family.
[in English] I think
you owe me an explanation.
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?
[sighs] I bruise easily.
You're such an asshole. Come on.
[speaking in Japanese]
Let me talk to the cop.
This cop's mine. Get your own source.
[in English] Speak fuckin' English,
asshole.
[speaking in Japanese]
No individual's more important
than the family.
[Ivy in English] Tell me.
If you trust me, this isn't something
you want to know about.
I want to know.
They kidnapped someone.
-I'm trying to find her.
-Why do you have to do it?
-Why don't they just go to the cops?
-'Cause it's a cop's daughter.
-He came to me.
-Oh!
-I gotta go. I gotta get out there.
-OK. OK.
I don't know if you're going to be
any help to anybody right now.
Don't be an idiot. Come on, OK.
Come this way.
[sighs] Ivy, I...
I just wanted to tell you...
sorry.
[groans]
Wuss.
-[Lafique] Where's Kanji?
-Fuck Kanji.
-What's the matter with you?
-Who did it?
-Get out!
-Calm down.
-Who killed my father?
-What the fuck are you talking about?
Play fucking stupid with me. I dare you!
-I'm mot playing stupi--
-Fuck you! Who did it?
I'm not going to ask you again. Who?
Lee.
Lee.
From Triple Eight.
Never.
No, no. He can't be.
He doesn't have the balls.
And what if he shot up your place, huh?
What if he killed your men?
What the fuck would you have done?
Your job's to keep people
from fucking back.
You fuckhead.
If you're not doing that,
why the fuck do we need
your little bitch daughter?
[speaking in Japanese]
You are certain it was him?
He admitted it.
His final words.
How did you find out?
I suspected from the beginning.
Our Interpol dog confirmed it.
The same man who provided
the dossier on your partner?
That's right. He's been very useful.
So, your friend is cleared.
As I expected.
Shigeru, you've done well.
You're becoming the man
we always hoped you would.
[speaking Japanese]
Sorry for the interruption
But we have more information.
There were important details
omitted from the policeman's dossier.
Only until late in the game.
Then it can change everything.
[sighs]
[groans]
[in English] Hey.
He's alive.
How did I get here?
You don't remember.
Those pills I gave you
really knocked you out.
Ivy, how long have I been out?
-Ah... Sixteen hours.
-Damn it, I got to go.
Yeah, 'cause you seem fine.
Ivy, there's a girl's life on the line.
So, you're gonna risk yours to save hers.
[door closes]
I'm told, you're the last person
to see my son alive.
You'll tell us exactly what happened.
And before you begin,
you should know,
I have a man on the way
to your family's home.
Huh!
I brought your pain killers.
Supposed to take two.
They're really potent.
So...
OK, or six.
-Ivy, you know--
-No, I'm sorry. I...
Peace offering.
Unless you were planning on hitching.
Just come back.
I promise.
Please, please, please. [sobbing]
[speaking in Japanese]
All this for one woman?
Two, if you count his mother.
Bring me this woman.
And find Kanji and Shigeru.
[music playing]
[cell phone vibrating]
[people speaking indistinctly]
[speaking in Japanese]
Grandfather?
-[in English] Yeah?
-[Lafique] Hey, something went wrong.
Something really went fucking wrong.
They just told me to pick my daughter
up at the docks.
What the fuck does that mean?
-[Darc] Lafique--
-They know.
-Where at the docks? Where?
-Pier 9.
Wait outside. Do not go on your own.
-You hear me, Lafique?
-A cartload of shit.
[tires screeching]
Where's my daughter?
You were warned what would happen to her
if you ever lied to us.
So, where's my daughter?
[Renee muffling]
Are you fucking insane?
Are you fucking insane?
Hey!
-[gunshot]
-[man screaming]
[man screaming]
[groaning and grunting]
[Lafique] Baby! Baby!
[tires screeching]
[Lafique] Come on, listen to me.
Cut her down.
-I'll tell you everything.
-We already know everything.
[Lafique] Baby!
Cut her down!
Cut her down!
Cut her down.
[grunting]
[man screaming]
[seagulls crying]
[gunshot]
[groans]
[Darc] No!
Renee, your dad's with me.
Renee.
Renee?
Lisa.
Lisa.
I'm sorry.
[gasping]
I got you.
I told them, they know. They know.
I know.
That's all right.
Get away! Go!
[speaking in Japanese]
He fucking lied to me!
All this time, he's been lying to me,
making a fool of me!
Faster, you fucking monkey! Faster!
Faster!
[cars honking]
[in English] Where is he?
Where the fuck is he?
-Where is he?
-He who?
[groans]
[grunting]
Where the fuck is he?
He's not fucking here!
[Ivy crying in pain]
Get off me!
[groaning and grunting]
[Ivy screaming]
Tell me!
Where the fuck is he?
[grunting]
[Shigeru] Enough!
Don't!
-I fucking vouched for you!
-Drop the knife.
Those tattoos, the night we met,
it wasn't just chance, was it?
-Was it?
-Let her go, Shigeru.
She's just my neighbor.
Shigeru.
Fuck you, and all your fucking lies!
[speaking in Japanese]
Move! Secure him.
[grunting]
[Jake speaking in Japanese]
It's pointless.
It'll just be you and me.
You will never be Oyabun.
[in English] You fucking...
Do it.
The last thing you're gonna see
will be the inside of her throat.
-No, no, no.
-On your fucking knees, you piece of shit.
[speaking in Japanese]
Secure him!
[in English] Hands behind your back!
Ivy, it's OK.
It's OK.
Shigeru.
She's innocent.
Shigeru-san,
let her go.
Fuck it.
[groans]
No!
[grunting and groaning]
[speaking in Japanese]
Enough!
Put him in a chair
Leave us.
Shigeru, you too.
Oyabun, please.
[in English] Look at me.
There was a boy once, a lifetime ago,
with a whore for a mother.
[speaking in Japanese]
That he was even allowed to live,
was a mistake.
[in English] I can't recall most
of the men I've killed,
but women,
there's something different about them.
You want to kill me, Darc?
It's like you said,
it was a lifetime ago.
And yet, my son died in the present.
[speaking in Japanese]
Get that little shit in here.
[in English] He's weak, he's ambitious,
perhaps, even he's a coward.
But it is his duty to avenge
his father's death.
[speaking in Japanese]
Oyabun, I...
You will take him away and deal with him.
Leave it to me.
You will take Mr. Kimuro with you.
Wait a second, Oya...
You'll do what I say!
I understand.
[door lock opens]
[car engine whirring]
[speaking indistinctly]
[groans]
[Shigeru] Jake.
Come on, Jake.
I fucking saved your life, Jake.
Fucking saved your life.
I have money.
You and I can start something.
It was just a fucking girl! Come on.
Jake, please.
Come on, Jake.
Jake, come on. Jake, please.
Jake, Jake, Jake!
Please, please don't.
Jake, please!
[speaking in Japanese]
Prepare the men.
[Darc screaming]
[grunting]
[fire alarm blaring]
[all sighing]
Get out! Move it, move!
Move, get out, move!
[grunting]
[elevator bell dings]
[screaming]
[grunting]
[speaking in Japanese]
Juu...
the card that can change everything.
Are you here to save the girl?
Or avenge your mother?
You don't even know anymore.
[in English] Drop it.
[Renee screaming]
[Ginzo] You want to save her?
Or let her end up like your whore mother?
You're already dead.
So, end it now,
and I'll let her live.
[grunting]
Her life.
Or yours.
[sighs]
[Renee sobbing]
I'm sorry.
[Ginzo] Do it, or else.
Of course,
where I'm going to send her,
she will be begging for death.
She will wish--
Mister.
Stay with me. Stay with me!
Breathe!
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Come on, breathe!
Mister! ...15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22...
