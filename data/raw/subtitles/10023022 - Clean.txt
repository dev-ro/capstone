Yo.
Be good, Clean.
I'm workin' on it.
There were 25 victims...
I'm still lookin' for answers.
I just don't know
the questions anymore.
I just know there's
too much out there.
Sea of filth.
An endless onslaught
of ugliness.
Blight
Plastic.
Cheap shit cloggin' up
our minds.
Cloggin' up the drains,
poisoning our water,
turning us to shit.
Where does it all go?
I've got blood on my hands.
I'm stained.
I'm dirty.
No matter how hard I try,
I can't wash away the past.
Come here.
Travis.
Addict.
You know,
I got hurt serving.
They gave me some pills.
I just kept on taking 'em
'til I couldn't think about
nothin' else.
And, uh, one day,
they turned off the tap.
Got so sick I...
My legs wouldn't straighten out.
But the physical was nothin'
compared to what was
goin' on up here.
A good dose is hard to cop.
Streets were flooded
with that good, good dope, so...
The rush of violence
is better than dope.
Better than blow.
Better than base.
Meth. Crack.
If you're lucky, it'll let you
come down this way.
It's about cleaning up
my side of the street.
And lettin' it go.
So I can be of
maximum usefulness
where my feet are.
Right under me.
Here. Now.
What is it that
makes us return to
that empty place we
keep going back to?
The beaten dog
that needs his owner.
The jilted lover
full of hope.
A failed father...
who failed his child.
Many of these animals
are almost out of time.
- Hey.
- Hey, neighbor.
You're grandma
missed the meeting.
Figured you might need lunch.
You know people
are gonna start saying
you're my dad.
Let me guess.
It's good for you.
Ever think about eating fish
once in a while?
- Nah.
- Just mix it up a little.
Fish is dirty.
- You don't like it, I can stop bringing it.
- No, no. Hold on.
I got something.
Used to make these for
my parents before the accident.
That's for me?
It's a gratitude bracelet.
Go on, now,
you're gonna miss the bus.
Bye.
Hold up, please,
I'm coming.
- Shit.
- Yo.
It's cold out there,
motherfucker, huh?
Yeah.
You know, man,
I can set my
motherfuckin' clocks on you.
What you got here today?
Oh, shit.
Fuckin' Electrolux 30. Damn.
I ain't seen one of these
in years.
Yeah. I rebuilt
the cord winder,
I put new hoses, another plug.
You can check it out.
No, you say it's proper,
it's proper, man.
I'll give you
45 bucks for it.
All right.
- Thanks.
- My man.
Yeah.
Shit, you think
I don't know that?
Yeah, I know that.
Of course.
Hey, my man, let me see
the one with the pistol grip.
Motherfucker, if you can't see
what's goin' on,
you must have
a stye on your eye, nigga,
I don't know
what you got goin' on.
Let me get that one
right there.
This one?
Nah, nah, nah,
not that one, man,
the one with the pistol grip,
the pistol grip.
Nah, nah, nah, wait right
there, I'm comin' right now.
- It's 300.
- 300?
It says 250 on the sticker.
- Hey, man.
- What up? Something's up.
- How's it goin'?
- Good.
What do you got for seconds?
Uh...
three today.
Ugly as shit.
Maybe you can give 'em
a second life.
That'll work.
Half off for public service.
Nice of you.
Where's my doughnut?
I just ate it.
I'll get you one next time.
I promise.
Hey.
Let me guess.
Bye.
I'll meet you
right here, girl.
Gotta get the bus.
♪ Ora pro nobis ♪
♪ Nobis peccatoribus ♪
♪ Nunc... ♪
Where are your feet?
Under me.
What you say?
Come on, man, I said
right here, under me.
It is my job to remind you...
that choosing not to talk...
is still choosing.
That's on you.
We do the work.
And that's it.
Most guys I sponsor,
they got a hard time
doin' work.
Don't want to see
what they did,
don't want to take care of it.
They just want to leave
the mess that they made.
Sweep it up under the carpet...
And hope that it goes away.
But you...
you got a different
sort of malady.
Yeah, it ain't the work.
That's the problem.
It's the lettin' go.
Some things
you can never clean up
no matter how hard you try.
What happens then?
Well, you find a way...
to make peace with them.
Or they make war with you.
You must trust in the plan.
Be a warrior of the lord.
Can you?
Then join us in
this commitment.
Shout it out.
I'm a warrior in service of
a powerful god.
Here I am, Jesus...
There's my boy.
Here I am.
And I will stand for the
redemption of everything.
Fuckin' embarrassing.
Want me to get him?
Let him get it
out of his system.
- Yo!
- Yo!
...shot in
front of a convenience store
when police responded to
reports of a man selling CDs
in front of the store.
Now reportedly...
Oh, hang on.
He'd been shot at...
New cuts. Gotta open up
your route a bit.
Sorry, boss.
...initial reports from police.
They suggested that...
All good.
...he was actually
running away...
Hey.
What's up?
No school?
- The bus didn't come.
- Didn't come?
They said service cuts.
Stopped running it to
the neighborhood.
Your grandma can't take you?
Car's broken.
But it's fine.
I can walk.
You can walk, huh?
You miss people?
What?
I mean,
I always see you alone.
Just wonder if you miss
being around people.
I am around people.
Just...
seems like you wouldn't
be alone, that's all.
Like you'd have a girl
or whatever, all that.
Nah. I ain't really good
at all that.
Yeah.
Catch y'all on
another level, though,
yo, ya'll stay up,
be safe, y'all.
I love y'all niggas, man.
Catch y'all when I get home.
You're late.
Yeah, my fault.
We got work.
You're on the clock.
Maybe I don't feel like smellin'
like fuckin' fish tonight.
That's the smell of success.
What do you got,
one left?
Yeah.
- I got it.
- All right.
Twelve.
We're short five.
- Fuckin' Chinks.
- Yeah, fuckin' Chinese.
Five on 200 ain't shit.
No?
Ain't shit.
Your grandfather,
Michael Sr., used to say,
"You let the small things slide,
you'll be failure."
Okay, Dad.
Okay.
Put Mikey to work.
They stopped runnin' her bus.
She's not your daughter.
Don't get it confused.
You know, we don't need anyone
to save her.
I'm just tryin' to
save myself.
This place.
There used to be families in
every house on this street.
You could hear their kids
laughin' all the time.
It was like music.
I saw you paintin' those
abandoned buildings.
You're a good man.
No, ma'am.
I remember I got a
bike like that for my daughter.
She was wild, man,
she made me take
the training wheels off
after a week.
I was like,
"You sure, baby?'
She said, "You only got
two wheels, Daddy.
You only got two wheels."
I said...
"Okay."
I'm pullin' out bits of street
from her knees.
Puttin' Band-Aids on 'em
every night and, like,
cleanin' the blood
off her school clothes, just...
She didn't care,
she just loved it.
Yeah, I can see her ridin'.
She was ridin' all wild with
her hair behind her.
This little toothless smile
on her.
She said, "I want to ride
like you, Daddy."
You did good.
Jesus said,
"You give them
something to eat."
They said to him,
"We have only five loaves here
and two fish."
And he said,
"Bring them here to me."
Then he ordered the crowds
to sit down on the grass.
And taking the five loaves
and the two fish...
he looked up to heaven...
and he blessed and broke
and gave the loaves to
the disciples.
And they all ate
and were satisfied.
And they took up
12 baskets full...
with the broken pieces
leftover.
And those who ate...
were about 5,000 men...
besides women and children.
This is the gospel of our lord
Jesus Christ.
Thanks be to God.
Get those boxes over here.
Marcus,
quit fuckin' around.
See what we got.
Michael.
My father, Michael Sr.,
he used to make me
clean these things.
Nastiest job in the shop.
Fuckin' guts rot
as soon as they hit the air.
I used to hate that smell.
I got used to it.
Watch.
Short five.
Check your scales.
Now clean the fuckin' squid.
Sorry about the smell.
I'm used to it.
They got you out here
all alone, huh?
Cuts.
Here.
I quit.
Gotta do everything ourselves
these days, huh?
Oh. Hm...
For your trouble.
I'm good.
Be safe.
You too.
Fuck.
Leave me alone, man.
What you lookin' at?
I said you got
a motherfuckin' eye problem?
Hi, baby.
...could cause
some slight nausea
but you'll get used to it
quickly.
Barely any risk of dependence
with the time release.
Clinic will refill
as long as pain persists.
I don't want that.
I don't know what kind of shit
you put yourself through,
but it's a miracle
you can even walk.
And I'm talking about
your injuries
before this incident.
Take the meds.
Yeah. I'm good, thanks.
- Boss...
- I promise you...
The lawyers.
You gotta take a few weeks.
Liabilities, man.
- Call when you can drive.
- I can drive, man.
They're not gonna
let me work.
Talk about liabilities.
Lawyers.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Maybe just, uh...
walk a while.
Hey.
Hey.
What's goin' on?
It's cold.
Grandma's out.
I left my key inside.
You hungry?
Chicken?
Chicken. Yeah.
I thought something bad
might have happened.
Huh?
I said, I thought something bad
might have happened.
No, I'm good.
Yeah, I'm good.
- You done?
- Mm.
I got it.
How's school?
Boring.
Boring?
Know what's boring?
Not knowing how to read.
That's what's boring.
I can read.
Don't touch that.
Fentanyl is now
the most common drug
involved in drug overdoses
in the United States.
- He scores!
- Yes.
Hey.
Your team's winning.
Rather be back in the pen...
I'm talkin' to you.
Rather be with
my friends on the street...
- Mikey.
- Than these old ass parents,
with my boys is the grillest,
the streets is my family,
man, I know you can feel it.
You think those niggers
are your family?
The only reason your boys
keep a punk like you around
is 'cause they know your father
is the motherfuckin' king!
Yeah, well, fuck you!
Yeah? You want to stab me?
Go on, little prince.
Go ahead.
Make yourself a man.
Man, fuck this shit!
I'm done,
this shit is dead!
Oh.
Okay, Kanye.
Look in the fuckin' mirror!
I don't know
this little freak.
What you need?
Gettin' late.
You ain't my father.
You're a woman now.
Your grandma's gonna worry.
Hey, yo, you deaf,
motherfucker?
Get the fuck outta here.
Trippin', dawg.
Seriously, dawg?
She said she was busy.
What's up?
Yo, Oz!
There he is,
my main motherfucker.
What's up, baby?
On schedule as usual.
- What you got in here now?
- Yeah, I got a... an amp.
- Ooh, shit.
- Yeah.
It's an Alpine 450.
This shit used to bump
back in the day.
Had the 18 inch woofers,
like, bump, ba-bump,
ba-bump, ba-bump.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I like shit like this.
Blowin' all the hinges off
the motherfuckin' car.
Yo, Clean.
You got some more work
to do, man.
Demons.
Demons, man.
I ain't talkin' about the ones
with horns and shit
'cause them motherfuckers
don't scare me.
Talkin' about the ones that
show up at four in the morning.
You know,
the ones you can't see.
But they're there.
They sittin' on the edge of
your bed.
You know, they sittin' there
and they talkin' to you.
Tellin' you you ain't shit.
Tellin' you that you're
worse than shit.
Tellin' you that you can't be
nothin', man,
that you can't do nothin'.
Can't be of no type of service
to anybody you care about.
Except bring everybody
the same pain
you brought anybody that
gave a fuck about you.
Yeah, those the demons
I'm talkin' about.
Them motherfuckers.
Yo, I know you.
- I don't think so.
- Nah, I never forget a face.
You look real familiar.
No.
You the guy
with the rich.
Father, I'm trying
to show him principles.
Hard work, discipline.
Family.
All I ever wanted was to teach
my son to be a man.
But I'm failing him, Father.
I'm failing.
It is the lot of
every father
to worry about his children.
If God can redeem
the worst among us,
surely he will show you and
your boy the right path.
Persevere.
What's up?
We closed.
Motherfucker,
I said we closed.
I'm gonna have to
open you up.
What?
He'll make a full recovery.
But if he doesn't get to
a surgeon now,
the cosmetic complications
could be substantial.
He may never
speak properly again.
He needs a real doctor.
Leave it.
Let him remember.
The guy with the wrench lives
up the street from that place.
Been a resident eight years.
Nothin' on him before that.
He's a trash man.
Trash man.
Looks like they left
in a hurry.
My people are already
looking for make and plate.
It's our show.
Kill the girl and
the old lady first.
So he can see.
Make it messy.
It's not your fault.
Fuck.
Turn around. Eyes ahead.
Shit.
He's not calling it in.
Shit.
What are you...
What are you doing?
He's with them.
We're gonna need a new car.
Boss.
We almost had him.
At least we know he's
up north.
We got eyes everywhere now.
Seven Hector's crew.
They'll call when it's done.
I need the bathroom.
- You're gonna have to wait.
- No, I need to go.
I'll take her.
I'll be out front in
three minutes. Okay?
- Watch it.
- Sorry.
Shit.
All right, you see that?
Try that, motherfucker!
Shit.
Dianda. Door.
I'm sorry.
Angel?
Fuck.
Baby.
Why?
Hey.
Oh, no, no, no, baby.
Wake up.
Baby, wake up.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Please, God, no.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
God!
We can never go home.
You did this.
I'm gonna make it right.
Will you come back?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You can go to the cops.
They're with him.
Then drive.
Start again.
All of you.
They'll find us.
They'll find them.
This is for the girl.
You can
give it to her yourself.
It won't stop.
How do you know?
Because I wouldn't.
You said find
a way to make peace.
I did.
There he is.
One-man Amazon.
What you got in the bag for me?
I'm buying today.
Okay.
What you need?
- Home protection?
- Hunting.
Hunting season over, man.
Not yet.
I need a carry out.
You want a carry out?
Yeah.
Look, there's no waiting period
for the shotguns...
Yeah, shotgun. Let me see
the one with the pistol grip.
That's on layaway.
But I got somethin' for you.
This just came in today.
No numbers.
And it's cheap.
That'll kill
a motherfuckin' bear.
How much for
the flare gun?
That's on me, man.
My man.
You're wearing a hole
in my rug.
Yeah.
They're gone.
You know who's card
you pulled?
It's Carlo's guy
from Chi Town.
What the fuck
you talkin' about?
The one who disappeared.
You sent me to kill
the grim fuckin' reaper.
What?
The trash man...
wasn't always a trash man.
Yeah?
Who is this?
How'd you get this number?
Same way I got
your address.
Boom.
Come here.
Come here.
My man.
God has a plan.
We got cars
blockin' the driveway.
We got everything inside
and outside covered.
No one's gettin' through
this shit.
Hey, boss.
Yeah, Vic?
You know,
not for nothin'.
What kind of guy calls ahead
before doin' a hit?
A dead one.
Hey, Clean.
Some dudes came by
lookin' for you.
Yeah, I know.
Ugly motherfuckers.
You back?
Yeah.
I never really knew
my father.
Or what he did.
But, uh,
I knew he was tough.
When I was really young,
I saw him die.
He looked at me.
He was more surprised
than anything.
Didn't say goodbye.
I'll always remember
that look.
Like he was trying to
teach me a lesson.
He used to say, uh...
I'm allergic to death.
Huh.
My own, at least.
Ain't we all.
To fatherhood.
Fatherhood.
Forgive me.
Take him out!
Hold!
Reload.
He's in the room!
He's in the fuckin' room!
Fuck!
Get him!
- Come on, get out!
- Kill this motherfucker!
Just go. Go!
Boom.
Stay down.
He's there.
All the way down.
You smash my kid's face
to shit.
And then you drive
a fuckin' garbage truck
into my goddamn house!
There's my boy.
Time is an eraser.
It takes away the burn.
Allows you to heal.
Forget some of the things that
you're better off forgetting.
But some things,
some people,
always stay with you.
I believe in angels.
Not the ones with wings
and a halo.
The ones that don't
look like them.
Hey, Dianda.
They're in disguise.
Sometimes...
it's hard to tell
who's the saved...
and who's the savior.
And the NYPD
is investigating...
...deadly shooting in Queens.
Police say
a 27 year old man...
...was shot in the neck.
...pronounced dead
at Jamaica Hospital.
Two other men...
...were also shot.
Hello?
Hey, yo, it's Clean.
You let 'em know...
it's done.
Hey, Papa, it's done.
All right.
I will relay the message.
