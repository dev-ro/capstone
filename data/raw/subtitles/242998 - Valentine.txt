Shelley?
Dance with me?
In your dreams, Ioser!
Lily?
Will you dance with me?
Paige?
Will you dance with me?
I'd rather be boiled alive.
Hi, Kate.
Want to dance?
Maybe Iater, Jeremy.
Okay. Maybe Iater.
Hi, Dorothy.
Do you want to dance with me?
Check it out.
Thick and thin getting it on.
-Like it, Buffalo? Getting hot?
-Stop. Get away from me!
Is Pervert at it again?
He attack you?
Yeah.
Jeremy attacked me. He attacked me!
Pervert jumped Buffalo.
-I didn't. No!
-Pervert.
Come on, Iet's get him.
Come on!
Sock him in the face.
Get him.
Yeah, fight!
-Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Punch him!
It's simple, really, Shelley.
You see, from an evolutionary
point of view...
...Jason Iooks for a pretty, young
woman because he wants healthy kids.
And a young woman, Iike yourself...
...Iooks for a successful man Iike
Jason because she wants to feel safe.
Jason has some spinach in his teeth.
Thanks.
Anyway, and so the species survives.
What else is there,
really, in the end?
In the end.
Well...
...there's the check.
-Check, please.
-Yes.
-Could you get my car?
-Of course.
Thank you.
No dessert?
No, I'm sorry. I have finals.
That's too bad.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.
Whoa.
''Muy expensivo.''
Let's see, you had the salmon...
...and the crab cocktail.
I had the chicken and the salad.
And that would be....
Right.
Okay, well. Thank you, Jason.
It was nice to meet you.
What, that's it?
-What's it?
-Don't I get a kiss?
-Excuse me?
-Just a little fricking kiss.
Oh, God.
This hard-to-get shit
doesn't play with Jason.
Jason, I'm not a doctor yet...
...but it's my considered opinion
you seek psychiatric help...
...soon.
Says you!
Jason Iikes your dress.
Okay, Chad, it's just you and me now.
I promise to be gentile.
Oh, strong, silent type.
How refreshing.
Transversus abdominus.
Someone there?
Hello?
Hello?
-Oh, my God!
-You scared the shit out of me.
Sorry.
Oh, wow.
It's awfully Iate.
WiII you be okay in here ail alone?
Oh, yeah, I've got Chad. My corpse.
Good Iuck tomorrow.
-Thanks. You too.
-Thanks.
''The journey of Iove
Is an arduous trek
My Iove grows for you
As you bleed from your neck.''
That's nice.
That's really nice.
Okay.
Oh, my God, stop!
Shit!
Stop fucking around.
Shit!
Come on, Kate, you promised!
Paige, today at work I wrote a column
about computer monitor dust wipes.
-Isn't that enough pain for one day?
-This isn't painful.
PainfuI's bind dating.
Or meeting someone on the Internet
and finding out 6-foot-ish is really--
Five-four with Ioafers, I know.
Kate, you'II meet 30 guys tonight.
You get 30 seconds apiece,
unless you want more. It's brilliant.
It'll be fun.
I haven't really completely
broken up with Adam yet.
But you will. Believe me,
relationships don't make U-turns...
...and Adam's a drunk.
He's not a drunk.
He's a borderline
addictive personality...
...who happens to Iike alcohol a lot.
AII right, fine.
Let's just do it already.
My mother's family dates back
to the Mayflower.
I traced it myself.
She makes her own turtlenecks.
She had nine children.
Awesome, huh? She's--
She's a pretty amazing woman.
Left me out of the goddamn blue.
Says she can do better.
Says...
...I don't fulfill her needs...
...sexually.
It's obvious to me.
The girl’s got to be a dyke.
Greatest team in the history
of professional footbaII : 49ers!
The Bible.
The Bible is the foundation
of morality and marriage.
I....
I know what you're thinking.
-You do?
-You want to get the hell out of here.
That's pretty good.
Hi there.
Hi there.
I'm Paige.
Brian.
Brian, did my friend mention that
she's in a serious relationship?
No, actually, she didn't.
But I'm free.
You're appalling, you know that?
-Hey, you had your 30 seconds.
-Twenty-four. You took my Iast six.
Hello.
Dorothy, you won't believe
what Paige made me do.
What?
Oh, my God.
What?
Shelley Fisher was taken long
before her time.
We mourn not her loss, but ours.
And so this is the time
for those of us left behind...
...to share our burden.
I never know what to do in situations
Iike this. I'm really bad at it.
I know that we're supposed
to be taking a break and all.
I just thought you needed a friend.
I'm glad you're here.
So....
What do I do?
Hey.
Front page.
Kate, that's for Spencer Marks.
You remember. We both started
on the paper together.
He just got lead reporter
on the Giants.
So I got it for him as a gift.
That's all.
Okay.
-I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
-Of course it matters.
Look, I haven't touched
a thing in three weeks.
I'm doing really good, Kate.
You think that we can
get together this week?
Dinner or something?
-I don't know.
-It's just dinner, not a proposal.
Adam, the Iast time we had dinner...
...we ended up in
a Lake Tahoe hotel for three days.
Oh, yeah, right.
That.
-That.
-Yeah.
-I'II call you, okay?
-Yeah.
He Iooks good, huh?
Kate, that boy always Iooks good.
Was that Adam?
Don't give me a hard time right now.
Sorry.
Jesus, Paige, it's a funeral.
What?
Did you see the police are here?
I know.
So awful.
How are you doing, Lily?
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I can't believe she's gone.
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Detective Vaughn.
Are you friends of Shelley?
We've known her since we were kids.
Okay if I ask a few questions?
-Sure.
-Yeah.
When did you Iast see her?
About a year ago.
-More Iike two for me.
-Same here.
She was so busy with med school.
You know anyone named Jason Marquette?
Who's that?
Shelley was with him the night
she died. Now he's missing.
Listen, ladies.
You think of anything, anyone...
...just give me a call.
Okay, ladies. Take care.
Thanks.
''Roses are red
Violets are blue
They'll need dental records
To identify you!''
Hey, Dorothy.
Hey, Campbell.
Come in.
Cozy little place you have.
Is everything okay?
Actually, I feel
a little weird about this.
I tried calling you earlier,
but you weren't home.
I need to ask a favor.
Sure.
My roommate left town
without paying his rent.
When I got home today,
all my stuff had been thrown out.
Skis, CDs, clothes,
everything just gone.
The timing couldn’t be worse.
Every penny I have...
...is invested in this startup.
Millie?
Millie!
-Can you please make up a guest room?
-No, I couldn’t--
Did your father say?
No. I said.
-Dorothy, I'm embarrassed about this--
-Don't be ridiculous.
Go get yourself settled in
and I will be right there.
You are the best.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
Who's your friend?
He's Campbell. I met him at yoga
and he's off-limits.
Let my dad know he's staying here.
Is he the reason
you're always on the treadmill?
Kim, you're not my girlfriend
or my mother.
I'm just taking an interest
in your life.
You know, as your stepmom.
When you're old enough to rent a car,
we can discuss your role as stepmom.
In the meantime,
don't talk about my sex life.
You have a sex life?
I do. And I don't charge
by the hour Iike you.
How dare you?!
Get your hands off me,
you mail-order bride from hell!
Hey, break it up, you two!
She just called me
a mail-order bride from hell.
Dorothy.
Who knows what she just called me?
It's okay, sweetheart.
You have to show
more respect to my wife.
But, Dad! She--
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, come on.
Not today!
It's Murray the super.
Leave a message.
Murray, it's Kate in 403.
I don't have any water and I need
to be at work in half an hour.
I've got crap in my hair and--
Damn it!
Murray! Are you there?
Shit!
Perfect timing, Murray.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Kate.
Hi, Gary.
You look great, Kate.
How about a date, Kate?
You can be my mate, Kate.
You're scary, Gary.
This could be our fate, Kate.
Hey there, Lily.
Hey there yourself.
Thank you for requesting my tape.
My name is Lance.
Hello, Lance.
I think I'm perfect for you.
I'm outgoing, I'm fun,
I'm six-foot-ish.
I like board games.
I play a lot of ocean sports.
You know, kayak--
Goodbye, Lance.
Better Iuck next time, Lance.
Who is it?
Who is it?
There's nobody there!
It's probably Lance.
He doesn't clear the peephole.
Hello!
-That's strange.
-They were fast.
I bet it's from Max.
The rose.
Valentine.
Let's see it.
'''It's a well-known fact that
Beauty is skin deep
Savor the taste
You are what you eat.''
Well, that's sweet. I think.
It's the strangest Valentine
I've ever seen.
Oh, Look. It's not from Max.
Look: J.M.
-Must be for you.
-Why?
You've covered much more of the
alphabet than I have. Who's J.M.?
Bite me. It's definitely for you.
Okay.
You say it's for me, it's for me.
-John McCrite.
-Never even made a pass at me.
Jeff MaIIick?
Not his style. Jake Matheson.
Gay.
Who was the guy who sent you
the computer virus?
Beckett Broda.
Damn. J.M., J.M., J.M....
Jeremy Melton?
Who's Jeremy Melton?
I'm kidding.
No, who's Jeremy Melton?
Come on! Sixth grade.
Pervert. Sixty pounds.
Buck teeth.
''You look so pretty, Paige!''
-He can't still live in town, can he?
-Lily, I'm kidding!
No, I know, it's just--
What do you think happened to him?
I don't know. What does it matter?
It doesn't.
God, we were so horrible to that kid.
Whatever.
AII I know is that was nasty.
I'm taking maggots. Actual live
worms inside the chocolate.
At least he left it at the door.
I swear there was someone
in my apartment.
You must have left your door unlocked.
We were all so looped when we left.
But it still freaked me out.
You should’ve seen this mask.
Look what we have here.
He's subtle.
Well?
You want to come over?
I guess not.
-Bye!
-Hey, guys.
This is Max.
Hi, Max. I'm Kate.
Hello, Kate.
That will do, Max.
I'm just being polite, Paige.
So isn't the show great?
Yeah, it's great. Cheers.
Better than your Iast one.
You hate it.
No. No.
It's all right.
I hate it too, sometimes.
But an artist has got to explore.
Max, I'm sorry. We're having trouble
with the video playback in the maze.
Christ.
Forgive me.
Girl.
I'II be right back, you guys.
-Hi!
-Hello.
I'm Paige.
Hi, Paige. I'm Campbell.
So, what brings you to this
fascinating cultural event, Campbell?
That's a very good question.
I'm here with--
Hi, guys! I see you've met Campbell.
Paige was just hitting on him.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Campbell, this is Kate and Lily,
and I see you've already met Paige.
Nice to meet all of you.
We all had headgear
and braces together.
Really? You all seem
to have turned out all right.
Well....
-Can I get you a drink?
-Yes, please.
Dorothy, what else have you
been keeping to yourself?
Valentine’s Day.
What does it mean?
What's it really about?
Celebration of true Iove?
It was really strange.
A cupid mask, Iike a cherub.
Like at that Valentine’s Day dance?
What dance?
Junior high. God, Jeremy Melton.
Oh, my God, this is so weird. We were
just talking about him this afternoon.
So, ladies and gentlemen...
...I hope you enjoy your blind date.
If you would, I need the ladies to go
to the left and the men to the right.
Ladies one side, men the other.
Ladies one side, men the other.
What do you like to do?
What do you like to do?
Wow.
-What is wrong with this guy?
-Dorothy!
-Look at that one.
-Sorry.
What do you like to do?
What do you like to do?
This is Iike a lingerie commercial.
That's his point.
It's art. Just keep going.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Love me.
Guys?
-What?
-Who's that?!
Hey, Amy.
That's Amy.
What do you mean, ''That's Amy''?
Get her out of here!
But I invited her here.
Excuse me?
-Jesus, relax.
-What the hell are you doing?
It's not Iike we're in junior high.
Look, I've gotta go.
I have an early flight tomorrow.
Forget this!
Great. What's the matter?
''What's the matter?''
The problem is, you turned out to be
a cheap, hypocritical sleazeball.
Yeah, but you knew that.
So does this mean you're not
gonna be my Valentine?
I said I want my money back.
Hey, leech, I'm talking to you.
I don't know what you're talking--
-Oh, really?
-That's right.
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.
-If it isn't the latest victim.
-Excuse me, who are you?
-That's none of your business.
-She's no one.
No one.
Just the idiot who's still waiting for
the return on her Internet investment.
What did you call that again?
BIeed-me-dry.com?
That's nice. Let's go, Dorothy.
Watch your back, leech.
-Sorry I didn't go.
-You didn't miss much.
Except for some crazy woman
attacking Dorothy's boyfriend.
And some really bad art.
The stuff was basically porn.
Sounds okay.
Things have just been
really weird lateIy.
Today, I find this cupid mask
in the elevator.
I turn around and there's
my creepy neighbor leering at me.
''Don't be Iate, Kate.
You're first rate, Kate.'' Him?
Yes, that guy.
Every time I do laundry, he's there.
Day, night, it doesn't matter.
Knock it off.
Yesterday, my underwear was missing.
Don't worry, that was me.
I Iike to try them on, you know?
Makes me feel free.
Tap into my, you know, feminine side.
-What's it gonna be tonight?
-Can I have a Corona?
Just a club soda, please.
Actually, make that two.
So...
...what do you say?
I'm just asking you
for a chance, that's all.
I want to, Adam...
...but you drink, and you get
out of control, and it scares me.
I've stopped. I've changed.
So it won't make
a difference if you wait.
Right.
I don't get it. We told you we
haven't seen Shelley in over a year.
-How are we gonna help you?
-Humor me.
Wasn't there another one of you?
Lily.
She's out of town.
These are remembrance cards
sent to the parents.
Look at this.
It's odd.
J.M.
Jeremy Melton, jeez.
Who's Jeremy Melton?
This Ioser from sixth grade.
-He and Shelley were friends?
-No.
We haven't seen him in years.
Why a card?
Because it's him.
It's Jeremy.
I got an awful Valentine
the other day...
...saying they were
gonna kill me, signed J.M.
Ours too.
The card and our chocolates.
You both received
threatening notes signed J.M.?
I tell you I'm looking for a
Jason Marquette, you don't mention it?
I thought it was a joke.
Okay.
Why would Jeremy want to hurt you?
He attacked me at a dance. He got
sent to reform school because of it.
That explains why he threatened you.
But why Shelley? Why your friends?
-I don't know, but he is.
-You don't know that.
Some kid that you teased
in the sixth grade...
...is probably not worth
getting all worked up over.
But I'II go check it out anyway.
You do that.
-I'm next. I know I'm next.
-What are you talking about?
Because Jeremy got sent
to reform school because of me.
Dorothy, he attacked you.
Dorothy.
He did attack you, right?
No.
He didn't.
I just said that he did.
Why would you do that?
You guys wouldn’t understand.
Do you remember
what I looked Iike back then?
You were bigger.
You were big-boned.
You were plump.
I was fat, okay?
The only guy that looked
at me that night was Jeremy.
And when those guys came up
and saw us making out...
...I couldn’t bear it and so...
...I lied.
And I said he attacked me.
Why didn't you say something
about this to Vaughn?
I just couldn’t.
Dorothy, I really wouldn’t
worry about this.
Jeremy Melton couldn’t manage
a water fountain without screwing up.
I don't think he's capable
of an intricate revenge plot.
You scared me!
What are you doing here?
-I thought we were having dinner.
-We are?
We are. I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.
I'm just a little distracted.
What's up?
It's probably nothing.
You wouldn’t believe me if I toId you.
You think it's far-fetched?
This whole Jeremy Melton
Revenge of the Nerds theory.
I don't know.
What should I do?
I'm thinking Mexico, the two of us,
until this all blows over.
Well.
-You want to come up?
-Yeah, I do.
Believe me.
I do.
But....
I don't want you to do something...
...that you'II write off
as a weak moment tomorrow.
So get upstairs before I lose my will.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Everything's gonna be all right.
First, you guys get Melton
shipped off to reform school.
A year Iater,
he lands in juvenile hall.
Six months after that,
a state-run mental hospital.
That's awful.
You must have done some number on him.
Where is he now?
AII we know is that his parents died
in a fire a couple years back.
-Was he involved?
-I don't know. Ruled an accident.
I want to show you something.
I pulled a file photo,
and I ran some enhancements.
Here we go.
That's him.
Right.
But know anybody that Iooks Iike this?
Or this?
Or this?
Or this.
Brown contacts, blue, green...
...beard, goatee, mustache?
Ten years is a Iong time.
And there's the possibiIity
of pIastic surgery.
Do you have more recent photos?
Don't you think
we'd be Iooking at them?
The point is, this couId be anyone.
Where's your friend LiIy?
We toId you. She's in L.A.
What do you know about Max Raimi?
Just that he is an artist. A bad one.
I know, I've seen his work.
What about the rest of you?
Any boyfriends?
Paige, for exampIe?
The short answer is no.
What about you?
Sort of.
But I've known him a whiIe.
Meaning what?
Meaning, we used to work
at the same paper.
He covers the Giants.
His mother is a Iawyer, his father
is a teacher. They're from SeattIe.
How's that?
What about you?
I have a boyfriend.
But I can guarantee you
he's not Jeremy MeIton.
Why don't you Iet me decide?
His name is CampbeII.
And he's very smart. He's starting
his own Internet venture.
How Iong have you known him?
-A month.
-Where did you meet him?
At yoga.
But it's a very excIusive gym, okay?
Wait.
I thought CampbeII
is staying with you.
WeII, he is.
His roommate didn't
pay the rent, so....
Dorothy, you met this guy a month ago
and he's staying with you?
There have been guys
whose Iast names you didn't know...
...that you Iet into your pants.
I'm just Ietting
this guy into my house.
You don't have to be bitchy.
Fine.
So whiIe we're
on the topic, Dorothy...
...what is CampbeII's Iast name?
You know, that's it.
This is buIIshit.
I don't have to answer these
questions.
I'II see you guys Iater.
That went weII.
I got to go.
Me too.
Paige, actuaIIy, I'd Iike you
to stay a moment.
Am I in troubIe, detective?
You want to interrogate me?
It wiII just take a second.
-TaIk Iater?
-Sure, if I'm not under arrest.
PIease take a seat.
So, what are we gonna do about this?
I thought that was your job.
You're the detective, right?
I'm not taIking about the case.
Don't be coy. I'm taIking about this.
This?
Tension.
The tension?
The sexuaI tension.
Let's be frank.
Detective Vaughn, pIease remove
your hand from my thigh.
AII right. Where wouId you
Iike me to put it?
How about up your ass?
Have a good day.
So you'II get back to me on that?
Who the fuck are you?
It's not what it Iooks Iike, brother.
Take it easy. I am not weII.
Here you go.
Hey, happy VaIentine's Day.
-Happy VaIentine's Day.
-I came by to drop off a gift.
I'd have been here earIier
but I was with that detective.
It was very romantic, actuaIIy.
-I wanted to expIain.
-Nothing to expIain.
He's taIking to everybody.
IKate, don't worry about it.
Do you need a date
for Dorothy's party tonight?
You don't want to go
to a VaIentine's party aIone.
True.
So where's my gift?
I picked it out myseIf.
It's very cute.
I got you something too.
-You got my suit cIeaned.
-Turn around.
''IOU TLC''
This is outstanding.
I Iove that.
Can't get that at the maII.
Nope.
Bye.
What the heII are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Detective Vaughn is
a disgusting, Iecherous scumbag.
What happened?
He put his hand on my thigh.
Did you ask him to?
What do you think?
I don't know.
-HeIIo?
-It's Dorothy.
HoId on, Dorothy. Paige is here too.
Hey, Dorothy.
IKate nearIy cIubbed me
on the head with an iron.
They came for CampbeII.
I know. They questionedAdam too.
Did they caII Adam or did they
question him for two hours?
They've requested that CampbeII
not Ieave town for a few days.
It's humiliating.
Did you give Vaughn his name?
No!
Then how did he get it?
He's a detective.
You go back and forth aboutAdam.
''Should I or shouldn't I?''
CampbeII is aII I've got.
I don't want to be dumped
before my party.
Just hang up the phone and make it up
to the guy if he's so upset.
What do you mean?
Use your imagination.
Thanks, Paige.
You're welcome.
She's so ridicuIous.
Do you need instructions?
It's Detective Vaughn, Kate.
Sorry, detective.
Good news. We picked up Marquette.
-Does this mean that it's Jeremy?
-We haven't questioned him yet.
But if it isn't MeIton,
you'II keep Iooking?
We 'll keep pursuing every angle.
Meantime, be careful.
Stay with your friends.
I'II Iet you know when I have more.
Thank you, detective.
WeII?
Picked up Marquette.
What do we have here?
PIan is to have this up
and running by tonight.
I'm sorry about this morning.
Don't even worry about it, reaIIy.
It's not a big deaI.
Happy VaIentine's Day.
Dorothy, what...?
I had no idea we were exchanging.
I'm embarrassed. Do I open it?
Put it on.
You Iike it?
Do I Iike it?
I Iove it.
Yeah?
Don't worry about it.
It's just that--
I'm gonna go take a shower.
Now it's my turn.
It's so beautifuI.
Thank you.
Listen, I have that investor meeting--
You're Ieaving?
Just for drinks.
It'II be an hour, tops.
You have the miIitant MiIIicent here.
She's got her army of caterers
and workmen so you'II be just fine.
Yeah, I guess.
WeII...
...do you care to join me now?
Tempting, tempting...
...but I want to work out
before my meeting.
But I promise you I wiII be
back for the party, okay?
IKevin WheeIer.
Account number 3-1 -6-5-9-3-6.
Look, we've been over this
three times aIready.
And I reaIize it's the entire account.
February 1 6th, 1 940.
Mother's maiden name? Sather.
Any other questions?
San Francisco.
What's that?
Don't teII me where the fuck I was
born. Just transfer the damn funds!
Campbell?
Campbell?
Yes, Dorothy?
We lost the hot water in the house.
Could you do me a favor and
relight the pilot in the basement?
Sure, that's no probIem.
Fucking perfect.
Now I'm on the staff.
Perfect.
Great.
Damn it!
Fucking perfect.
Shoot.
Yeah.
I think that's worth
at Ieast a Porsche.
Shit.
There you are. Excuse me.
There you are.
-Any Iuck finding a date tonight?
-I'm pIaying phone tag with Brian.
-Who?
-Brian.
The guy from Turbo Dating?
Right.
-I'm gonna go Iook around.
-Okay. Have fun.
StiII no CampbeII?
Nope.
WeII, it's onIy...
...1 1 :00.
He said he'd be here before the party.
I'm not an idiot, IKate.
I know when I'm being dumped.
-You're not getting dumped.
-Right.
-Happy VaIentine's Day, Iadies.
-Hey, Adam.
-You Iook great.
-So do you.
Yeah, you Iook great.
Nice party, Dorothy.
It bIows.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything is fine.
It's just that men suck.
That's no offense to you, Adam.
None taken.
Okay. Excuse me.
He'II get here, Dorth. Don't worry.
Don't ask.
Are you doing anything Iater on?
ActuaIIy, I'm busy.
I'm gonna hook up with a young stud.
Get a IittIe action.
ReaIIy? Sounds good. Anyone I know?
I'm young, reasonabIy good-Iooking.
It shouIdn't be that
difficuIt finding voIunteers.
Yeah, you'II do.
Hey, hot stuff.
You came.
I Iike how you move.
Why don't you join me?
You know...
...I'd much rather take you upstairs.
What's upstairs?
Something I want to show you.
It's a surprise.
I Iove surprises.
So....
So?
We're upstairs now.
Yes, we are.
You had a surprise for me?
Yes, I do.
Surprise.
You brought me up here
to show me your penis.
That's so sweet.
WeII?
What are you waiting for, honey?
Wax it!
You're unbeIievabIe.
Paige.
ReIax, okay?
It'II be fun.
AII right.
Take off your shirt.
AII right.
Don't forget your pants.
Now Iay down.
What are you doing?
Never mind. It's a surprise.
I knew it.
IKnew what?
First time I saw you,
I knew you were kinky, Paige.
You stiII want me to wax it?
Yes, I do.
God, Paige! Bitch!
This party sucks.
Things didn't go weII with Brian?
Oh, my God.
This is a private party.
Get your IittIe paws off me.
What is she doing here?
She was just Ieaving, Dorothy.
That's my neckIace!
What? CampbeII gave this to me.
And what are you supposed to be?
His VaIentine?
I don't think so, sweetie.
That neckIace was stoIen!
AIong with haIf the rest
of my jeweIry.
Hurts, doesn't it?
He Ioves me.
He Ioves your trust fund.
Trust me.
Time to go.
Watch the jacket!
Now this party officiaIIy sucks.
No kidding.
Where are you going?
To chiII out.
HeIIo again.
Wait a minute.
Where are you running off to?
What do you want, Max?
Easy, sweetness.
I wanted to know if you've seen LiIy.
She's in L.A. And don't caII me
''sweetness.''
WeII, sweetness, LiIy is not in L.A.
What are you taIking about?
I caIIed her office, and they said
she never showed up.
Are you sure?
About what?
HeIIo. Max, about LiIy.
How Iong have you known this?
You're reaIIy at home
in this outfit, girI.
You just Iook yum.
Great.
What are you supposed to be?
I was just....
Dorothy?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Listen. That Max guy said that LiIy
never showed up in L.A.
Have you heard anything from her?
No.
But I bet Paige has.
-Do you think he's here?
-Who?
-Jeremy MeIton.
-God, I hope not.
My dad's got a gun in his study.
That's a good way
to get us both kiIIed.
HeIIo?
It's Detective Vaughn.
We had to Iet Marquette go.
What do you mean?
We didn't have enough evidence
to hoId him.
He couId be anywhere, Iike your party.
What? What happened?
Listen, our friend LiIy
never showed up in L.A.
Stay put, stay in groups,
I'm on my way.
They had to Iet Marquette go.
So now they've got nothing?
Come on.
Which one of the TweIve Steps is this?
IKate!
There you are.
I've been Iooking aII over for you.
I wasn't at the bottom of a bottIe?
IKate!
Don't be mad! It's VaIentine's Day.
Get away from me.
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
Does someone want to be my VaIentine?
Come on.
HeIIo?
Come on.
Come on.
Brian?
AII right, get the fuck out.
Get off of me!
Stop it! Stop!
-IKate!
-Yeah?
Shit, we bIew a fuse.
Jesus, this pIace cIeared out fast.
Where is Paige?
ProbabIy in the hot tub. She aIways
ends up in the hot tub at parties.
Where's Adam?
Did you check the wine ceIIar?
CouId be him, you know.
What couId be him?
Come on, Dorothy.
No, no, no. Don't
''Come on, Dorothy'' me.
Why the heII not?
Because I know Adam.
He's no angeI, but he's not
a murderer.
You didn't know he was an aIcohoIic
when you first met him either.
I don't know if I trust your judgment.
That's enough!
Come on! With a IittIe working out
and some pIastic surgery...
...why couIdn't Jeremy MeIton
become Adam Carr?
Then by the same Iogic, why couIdn't
Jeremy MeIton be CampbeII?
You...
...shouId take that back.
Look, Dorothy.
I'm not saying it's true. I'm saying
if we're gonna be pointing fingers....
I mean, you heard what
that Ruthie woman said.
How weII do you reaIIy know CampbeII?
You don't even know his Iast name,
for God's sake.
-You reaIIy can't stand it, can you?
-Can't stand what?
That I found someone just as good
as your boyfriend.
Just as smart
and just as good-Iooking.
That's ridicuIous.
I mean, why?
Why shouId I, why shouId
the fat girI get a turn?
-What?
-Come on, IKate!
You're the popuIar one,
and SheIIey was the brainy one...
...LiIy was the fun one and Paige
was the sexy one, and I was...
...the big, fat one.
As far as you're concerned,
that's exactIy the way that it is.
You know what?
Screw aII of you.
Dorothy!
Come back!
Come on!
Come on, Vaughn.
This is Detective Leon Vaughn,
SFPD. Leave a message.
Paige! Dorothy!
Paige!
Dorothy!
Hi.
It's you.
-It's me.
-You're stiII here.
StiII here.
I heard a noise. I thought
something happened to Dorothy.
Dorothy's a big girI.
What do you mean?
Dance with me, IKate.
I just want to find Dorothy.
I'm asking you niceIy.
Dance with me.
Don't make me beg, IKate.
PIease.
I screwed up, IKate.
You had a few drinks.
It's not the end of the worId.
No, you're disappointed.
I'm just worried that you'II hurt me.
Hurt you?
Hurt you?
No, baby, I Iove you.
You're the onIy good thing in my Iife.
AII these other peopIe, they can
just die as far as I care.
But you...
...you mean something to me.
What's the matter? You're shaking.
I don't want to hurt you either, Adam.
I understand.
But I wiII.
Dorothy!
HeIIo, IKate.
What the heII's going on?
Nothing.
What happened back there...
...I just want to taIk about this.
I'm sorry.
I guess I was just a IittIe upset
about the drinking.
You were doing so weII.
Why do you want to hurt me?
I Iove you. AIways Ioved you.
Stay away from me!
Come on, IKate.
-Adam, I'm sorry.
-It's aII right.
I'm so sorry!
AII right. It's over.
It's over.
-No, don't Iook!
-It's aII right.
Dorothy!
Don't Iook at her.
It's at the top of the street
on the right.
PoIice are on their way.
I don't understand.
A few weeks ago, she was so happy.
Happier than I'd ever seen her.
It's okay.
I just don't understand.
AII I can think is...
...when someone is that IoneIy...
...or that angry...
...they can Iearn to hide it.
But inside, it never dies.
It just stays there.
Eats away at you.
UntiI one day, you have
to do something about it.
But we aII Iiked her.
We were her friends.
Sometimes that's not enough, I guess.
I am so sorry
for the way I was before.
None of that matters now.
I Iove you, Adam.
I Iove you, IKate.
I aIways have.
