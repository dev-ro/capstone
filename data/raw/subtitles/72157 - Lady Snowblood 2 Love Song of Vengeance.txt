I'll kill you!
On the behalf of heaven,
they attack injustice...
...they're our soldiers, the loyal,
invincible and brave.
Now it's time for them to leave
the country of their parents...
...their hearts buoyed by
encouraging voices.
They are solemnly
resolved...
...not to return alive,
without victory.
Here at home, the citizens
wait for you.
In foreign lands, the
brave troops...
In September, Meiji 38 (1905), the Russo-
Japanese War came to an end.
370,000 Japanese soldiers gave their lives
to secure this tragic victory, which...
...ensured that capitalism would be the
driving force of the Japanese Empire.
However, the post-war inflation
was very severe...
...and the people, as voiceless as
ever, could only fume in silence.
Around this time, one woman chose to
ignore the nation's predicament...
...solely to continue her journey
along the road of carnage.
"Wanted for Murder - Kashima Yuki"
Her name was Kashima Yuki... known
to some as Lady Snowblood.
Lady Snowblood... Calmly
surrender to us!
Men, don't let
her get away!
What's the matter, men?!
She's only a woman!
Attack! Go!
Don't let her get away...
no matter what!
Stop! Stop!
It'll heal in two
or three days.
Here...
It's just a pine cone.
Maybe it's your way, but if you don't relax
you're gonna exhaust yourself.

Lady Snowblood: Love Song of Vengeance
Kashima Yuki,
the accused...
...you have willfully undertaken
a series of assassinations...
...murdering a total of
thirty-seven people.
The crimes you have commit-
ted are inhuman...
...and you lack remorse. These crimes are
unforgivable by both gods and men.
You are therefore sentenced to hang
from the neck until you are dead.
March 14, Meiji 39...
...Judge Tanno Seiichiro of the
Supreme Court, presiding.
Does the condemned wish
to make a statement?
No, I do not.
This is a special prison that
houses female criminals.
It was behind these red brick
walls that Yuki was born.
"4-shaku:" about 4 feet. On a night when
4-shaku of snow fell on Tokyo...
...Yuki came into
the world...
...a child expected to
avenge her mother.
The day of execution
has arrived for Yuki.
Why did you
save me?
Where are you
taking me?!
Lady Snowblood...
...beautiful and cold, as
befits your name.
I've abandoned the
road of carnage.
What's left for you
in this life, then?
Without blood, you would be merely
snow... that melts into the dirt.
Snowblood...
Your life as a fugitive drained you,
and made you forsake fighting.
But there can be no such
thing as peace for you!
You're forever bound to live
a life of inhuman carnage!
Who are you?
It doesn't matter who I am... only
that I've saved your life.
I will ask you to return
the favor...
...with your skilled
blade.
I see... You don't seem to give a
damn about your obligations?
I suppose nothing is
wrong with that.
Well, then... do you
wish to leave now?
I won't stop you.
But, all you can look forward to is,
once more, the life of a fugitive.
The police, and assassins,
will ceaselessly hunt you.
You'll be forever on the
run like a stray dog.
And, once again... you'll
stand on the gallows.
A man named Tokunaga
Ransui is our target.
He is an advocate of anarchism, an
absurd yet devastating idealism.
I'd like you to watch him
closely for a month.
Also, there's an item that I'd like
you to find, inside his house...
...a certain confidential
document.
Japan won! Japan won!
The Russians lost!
The Russian battleship
was trashed!
Japan won! Japan won!
The Russians lost!
The Russian battleship
was trashed!
Japan won! Japan won!
The Russians lost!
The Russian battleship
was trashed!
"Tokunaga Ransui"
Darling?
Uh-huh.
Our maid is here.
Right. One moment, please.
Hello. I'm Tokunaga
Ransui.
My name is Yuki.
Well, as you can see,
we're a poor family...
...and so common sense would tell us
not to indulge in the luxury of a maid!
However, the fact is that
my wife is ill, so...
...well, I hope that we
can all get along.
# Instead of kindness from someone
I do not care about... #
# ...I rather prefer selfishness
from you... #
# ...my beloved. #
# Instead of... #
Aya... forget about everything
in the past...
I... want to bear
your child...
# Oh, is the world a dream
or an illusion...? #
# I am all alone
in jail... #
Yuki...
Hey... Yuki!
Yessir!
Water! Bring
me water!
Yessir!
Looks like he likes
you a lot!
My, that was
good!
Well, I'm an anarchist,
you see...
...but, I'm even
more a satyr!
Sensei. ("Sensei:" literally, "teacher," but
often used to refer to any learned person.)
# La la la... #
"The So-Called Rebellion - One Year
After. By Tokunaga Ransui."
Oh, it's you!
Well, you see... I tend to have... many
what you might call enemies.
Well, I apologize. No hard
feelings, I hope.
Oh, by the way, Yuki...
I'm going out later.
I'd like you to accompany
me, if you could.
Yes, sir.
Sensei... we're being
followed!
The police are always
watching me.
Those dogs!
Yuki... follow me.
Tricking them is... one
of the joys in my life!
But, you see... the place
we're about to visit...
...is somewhere I certainly don't want
fellows like those to step into.
This is the cemetery where
my comrades are buried.
After being arrested for carrying
out acts of rebellion...
...they were brutally
murdered last year.
Actually, this place is supposed
to be... a pet cemetery.
My comrades were slandered,
called insurgents...
...then buried here, like they were dogs or
cats... without funerals, of course.
Why did you bring
me here?
Because I wanted you to offer prayers
also... Miss Snowblood.
Your name is Kashima Yuki... known
to some as Lady Snowblood.
You've been desperately searching
for something inside my house.
You want a confidential document,
dangerous to the government...
...and, possibly,
my life.
The man who forced you to do this
is the head of the Secret Police.
Kikui Seishiro, the top man in the govern-
ment's intelligence apparatus.
And what is the goal of
the Secret Police?
To eliminate insurgents who rebel against
the almighty, divine nation that is Japan!
They're... the shadow police...
the shadow army.
Why did you keep me so close to
you... if you knew so much?
"Rebel's Cemetery"
That confidential document
you're after...
...I most certainly am in
possession of it.
It's right here, as
a matter of fact.
Let me tell you a story
about garbage.
Once, around here, there lived
a laborer named Yoshizawa.
Young, poor laborers... are nothing
but garbage in today's society.
Paid but a pittance... yet, exploited from
early in the morning 'til late at night...
...his life was just one shitty
day after another, I'm sure.
One day, he put all his anger
and loneliness into a bomb.
Last February, Yoshizawa got arrested for
blowing up the Kagurazaka police station.
People were shocked about this "Bomb-
Devil..." but it was soon forgotten.
But, Kikui of the Secret Police
came up with a plan...
...to use this youth
to his advantage.
"What if," he thought, "the bomb incident
was not the work of an individual..."
"...but was a plot, carried
out by the anarchists..."
"...and furthermore, was a part of a
plan to assassinate the Emperor?"
He fabricated a plausible story.
Then Kikui, and the Inspector General,
Terauchi Kendo, spread these lies.
They'd been waiting for the right moment
to dispose of all the anarchists at once.
Twelve of my fellow anarchists
were captured.
Without the benefit of legal counsel,
they were unjustly tried...
...and immediately
executed.
And, Yoshizawa, the only one
who knew the truth...
...was murdered
by Kikui.
Logically, they should have
come after me as well.
But, coincidentally, I was ill and home
in the countryside recuperating.
Fortunately... or unfortunately...
only I survived.
The crackdown gained
Kikui his current post.
Terauchi, too, was elevated to the
post of Minister of Justice.
But, Yuki...
...someday, I'll bring
them down!
I may be a powerless
nobody...
...but I do have a weapon,
one and only one...
This!
A document that Yoshizawa
left behind.
He wrote down, in detail, the daily
conversations between...
...Kikui and Terauchi... in a letter
meant for his mother.
If the "rebellion" is ever proved
to be a fabrication...
...both Kikui and Terauchi
will be finished.
That's why, to them,
the letter is...
...more powerful
than any bomb.
I see... She's betrayed us.
I thought I understood her completely...
that she was tired of being a fugitive.
However, I must give Tokunaga
Ransui credit.
He has successfully made
the fire burn stronger...
...the faint fire of vengeance
that was still inside her.
Kikui, events are not proceeding
favorably.
In three days, at
Shiba Park...
...there'll be a rally of anarchists
and proletarians...
...a joint national demon-
stration and protest.
Undoubtedly, Tokunaga Ransui will
make the letter public at the rally.
He will surely not squander
such an opportunity!
The press will jump right on it...
and the people will riot!
In the worst-case scenario, the uprising
will become so uncontrollable...
...that the government will
inevitably be crushed!
Just exactly what... is the Secret
Police going to do?!
Your Excellency... there is nothing
to worry about, sir.
We can have Ransui detained, if we
need to. And, that will be that.
I doubt that he'll reveal
himself anytime soon.
We don't have grounds
to detain him anyway.
We do, sir.
We'll just use
the woman.
Darling... please,
be careful...
Well, no need to worry
about me.
I've got Japan's best bodyguard at my side!
But... for days now, I've heard strange
rumors.. all about today's meeting.
Oh? Rumors are already
going around?
Well, just look forward
to reading the paper...
...because a wonderful bomb
is about to explode.
A bomb powerful enough to turn the nation
upside down!
I want you to
hold on to it.
Should something
happen to me...
...I'd like you to deliver it to
Dr. Tokunaga Shusuke...
...in Samegabashi, Yotsuya
District. He's my brother.
"Tokunaga Shusuke..."
Understood.
Greetings.
Halt!
Tokunaga Ransui,
Kashima Yuki!
You are both under
arrest!
"Under arrest?"
Tell us, for what
reason?
I, Tokunaga Ransui, don't recall violating
the laws of this glorious nation!
Don't act like you don't know!
Snowblood is the reason!
You know damn well that she's Kashima
Yuki, a condemned criminal...
...and you've harbored her! Arrest them!
Yessir!
Damn it, what do you think you're doing?!
C'mon! Get off the cart!
Give up!
Pull 'em down to the ground!
Sensei!
Get off me!
Yuki! Run!
Don't let go!
-Yuki! Run!
-Don't let go!
-Yuki! Run!
-Take this!
Never mind me! Run!
Sensei!
-Yuki!
-Sensei!
Halt!
Don't let her get away! Shoot! Shoot!
Halt!
Shoot!
Oh! Over there!
During this period, three
slums existed in Tokyo.
Shingami in Shiba, Mannencho
in Shitaya...
...and here, Samegabashi
in Yotsuya.
Hey, fellow, what do you want?!
The inhabitants made their living at
various menial occupations...
Day laborers... rickshaw
carriers...
...horse groomers... trashmen... and all
sorts of criminals, outcasts and losers.
This was a place where those left behind
by the ecstatic post-war society...
...and other unwelcome lowlifes
could live freely.
While there was no end to their
poverty and humiliation...
...they lived with tenacity
and spirit.
Some say this was a dark corner of
society, where dust collected...
...where the police could
rarely venture...
...a kind of lawless district, beyond
the reach of the law.
"Eatery"
Satsuki!
Say, Sekiguchi... what did you do
with that gold medal you got?
Got rid of it! It kept reminding me of
the war, you know... so I sold it off!
Why, you son-of-a-bitch...
Oh, well...
What about yours,
Takichi?
Huh? Mine? Well...
It's in a safe place where nobody can
find it. I figure it's a good memento.
Where is it?
You're always like that!
Got me again!
See?
Take that! This is the real
thing! The gold medal!
Y'know, if our next blackmail venture
works out... we'll be so loaded!
Alright! When that happens, why don't
we all go to Manchuria again?!
That's a great idea! We'll eat well...
...and there's women all over the place!
Yeah!
We can fuck them with our medals!
Please tell me... where Dr. Tokunaga
Shusuke's clinic is...
Where is... Dr. Tokunaga
Shusuke's...
Lady... what do you need
to see him for?
Oh!
"Samegahashi Clinic"
How are you feeling?
You...
Listen... you'll be fine, now that
you've stopped bleeding.
I doubt that you're gonna die!
So, you are...
Yeah. I'm Tokunaga Shusuke.
Fate is mysterious, eh?
Oh, the document?
I have it.
Oh, no, you don't. You
shouldn't move yet.
But... the police arrested
Sensei Ransui.
He should have been
prepared for it.
He lives to lead anti-government
movements, after all.
Does it hurt?
You can't do anything
in your condition.
For now, just get
some sleep.
Just sleep...
Hey, so what's the deal with that thing?
Well, wait a sec.
C'mon, what does it say?
Lemme see it!
C'mon!
Hey, Takichi...
Huh?
Did you read it all?
Well...
This is one hell
of a document!
If we use it correctly, we could easily
topple a government or two!
Right!
People are burning police stations
and staging strikes.
Little things can have huge
consequences these days.
This little piece of paper could
set off a major riot!
Oh? Is it that explosive?
Yeah.
What're you gonna do, Doc?
Ha!
Tokunaga Ransui... why are
you protecting Yuki?!
Even if you starve and wither... you
are a well-known activist, after all.
No matter how much you oppose the
authorities... and fight us like this...
...we know that you do it
out of a sense of duty!
But, not Yuki... she's
just a murderer!
You'll never understand...
...that, sometimes the act
of murder is a just...
...and rational one.
In your eyes... Yuki and I are... both
vermin infesting society, aren't we?
So what if we're vermin? We'll
never betray each other.
Why, you scum! You think you're
funny?! You're a fool!
No confession yet? He's
a stubborn fool.
Yeah.
If he's too much for
you, we could take over...
...as my organization is more familiar
with matters of this nature.
But, sir! The Snowblood investigation
was assigned to the police!
I don't care what happens
to Snowblood!
What's important is the secret
document he possessed!
B... But...
What should be your
top priority is...
...not arresting one
female assassin...
...but safeguarding law and
order in our nation!
If you want to hurt him, then
do so until you're satisfied.
So what if an activist is
tortured to death?
Nobody... will ever
give a damn.
Kill me, if you want!
Because, I won't tell you anything...
even if you're going to kill me!
Fine!
You asshole!
You stubborn fool!
Where is Yuki?!
Where's Snowblood?!
Tell us!
Tell us!
Where's Snowblood?!
Where is she?!
Go home... This is no place for you.
No! I'll stay here with you!
Go home! These guys don't give
a damn whether I live or die.
Why... Is it because you
let Yuki escape?
"Police Superintendent"
All right.
Is Sensei Ransui still being
held by the police?
Who cares...?
Why don't you go and try to save him?
What brings you here? What
do you want from me?
I know... that I shouldn't be visiting you,
after all that's passed between us.
But, you're the only one... that
I can talk to... right now.
Before I realized it... I was
already on my way here.
I hate to say it, but I don't think that
I can help you with anything.
That's not true... You can! You're
the only one that can save him!
What makes you say that? Are you telling
me to take Yuki to the police?
Did you come here just
to tell me that? Huh?
I didn't know that Yuki would be here...
not in my wildest dreams.
But...
Forget it. Go home!
But... Why don't you help your brother?!
I have no brother!
You still have a grudge
against us.
You won't forgive
us, will you?
Forgive you?! Ha! What're
you talking about?!
Look at this place!
Just look at it!
Garbage! They're all garbage!
And some of the garbage have their
weewee's sticking out too!
Yo, scum!
It's so bad here... so bad that I don't
give a crap about our past!
All right?
So, go home, will ya?
I'm a kind of blackmailer.
Your husband
tried to...
...use that document in order
to reform the nation.
But not me!
I'm gonna use it to swindle dough
out of those rich, fat scumbags.
With that money, we can eat and
drink all we want, in style!
Well? We'll all be
happy that way!
Oh... Don't you care what
happens to him...?
Oh? Who's that?!
Oh? What the heck is that?!
What happened?
What the...?!
Hey! What's going on?
What the...? What's going on here?!
Hey, what's going on...?
Who is that?
What happened here?
Where did he come from?
This guy doesn't look familiar...
Hey!
Oh!
Hey!
Who the hell are you?!
Don't run away!
What the...? Don't
let him get away!
Don't let him
get away!
After him!
Hey, c'mon guys!
Everybody,
come out!
Hey! You guys! What're
you doing?!
Hey, everybody,
come out!
Get him! But don't
kill him!
He's going that way! That way!
This way! This way!
Get him!
You asshole!
All right! All right!
Get him!

...101... 102... 103... 104... 105...
Had enough yet?!
Tell us why you came here!
Move aside!
Let me handle this!
He's not breaking yet?!
Very odd!
Such a stubborn fool!
The guy's not saying anything!
Now...
He's just unbelievable!
...do you want me to finish you off...
you dog?!
Darl... Darling!
"Samegahashi Clinic"
Who is it?
Please... Please
examine him!
Please examine him!
Sensei!
Stay back...
Move it, you bitch!
What's going on, Doc?
Don't come near! Get outta here!
Don't ever come inside
here, you hear?
The Black Death?!
It's not the usual
kind either...
He was given
an injection.
The Secret Police must've injected
him with the germ.
They've commenced
an attack upon us.
Yuki... I ask you not
to go inside, ever.
Also... don't say anything about
this to those guys...
...because if rumors start spreading...
we'll be in big trouble.
Can you save him?
No. He can't be saved.
Now, now, now... What do
you think you're doing?!
Kill her!
Why, you!
Kill her!
Somebody... please... somebody...
Kill her!
Do it... Kill her...
Kill her!
Over there!
What a shame...
Is this something the
police ought to do?!
Damn it...
Shu...
Don't talk, you fool!
Shu... I don't have a
chance... do I...?
Shu... or is there a chance...
that I'll live?
I don't want
to die yet.
I still have... a lot
of things to do.
Aya... Aya...
...I was wrong...
Lady Snowblood...
Just look at you two
pitiful souls.
Long ago, you betrayed
and left me...
...but, now you've come to me again,
looking like this! Fools!
You did what you wanted to do,
you got what you sought.
In the end, you lived the
way you wanted to live.
Aya... you were
once my wife.
You were such a
foolish woman.
Just what did you
ever see in him?
When I was chasing all over Manchuria
with only a gun in my hand, Aya...
...thoughts of you were
all that kept me going.
I thought that you were waiting
for me back home.
Until I see you again, I told myself,
I won't die... I can't die!
Those thoughts kept me alive, and
so I made it back to Japan.
But, my god!
Why did you... Why
did you have to...?
Since that day, I've had nothing
to do with you.
Doc!
Don't come
near!
I've no intention of completing
what you started! No way!
I'll get what I want... by
doing things my way!
Let's see now...
"To the people of Shinami,
in Shiba..."
"...50,000 yen in gold and
300 bales of rice."
"To the people of Mannencho,
in Shitaya..."
"...30,000 yen in gold and
200 bales of rice."
"To the people of Samegabashi...
50,000 yen in gold..."
"...and 300 bales
of rice."
"In sum... a total of 130,000 yen
in gold and 800 bales of rice."
"In the event that you
fail to pay up..."
"...your heads will roll." Done!
"Honcho:" literally, "True Leader."
Man, do I sound like a "honcho" or what!
You stopped being
an assassin...
...and now you're an aide
to a blackmailer?
State your demands. What
is it that you seek?
130,000 yen, cash.
And, 800 bales of rice to be distributed
to the people in the slums.
What if I refuse?
The document that you seek
will be sent to the press.
All will become
public then.
It'll be the end for you
and your superiors.
Yuki... Have you any idea
who you're dealing with?
You're "a praying mantis battling
a cart." You can't beat us.
We know where those lowly maggot
friends of yours are...
...and where you're hiding
the document!
If we wish... we can annihilate you
all in an instant... with ease!
Do it, then. If you're not afraid
of the Black Death, that is.
The Black Death?
You shouldn't be surprised
to hear of it.
You're the one who sowed
the seed, after all.
My comrade is suffering
from a severe fever...
...but he clutches the document in his
trembling hands... and waits for me.
Well? Why don't you go get it?
Perhaps I'm already infected as well.
Are you scared?! You keep
calling people maggots...
...yet you're scared of contracting
the Black Death, aren't you?
I bet you are.
To die coughing blood, and wracked
with a high fever...
Surely, you're too
worthy for that!
Too worthy!
Kikui...
We can finish our deal
right here, right now.
We'll trade all that you have
for all that I have.
What do you mean
by that?
You're right... I'm an assassin,
no better than a maggot.
Aside from my own life, I have nothing.
But, you're different.
You've maliciously exploited these so-
called changing times... to obtain...
Position... Power...
Money.
You wanted them so badly that
you could taste it, didn't you?
Wanna throw them
all away?
Fine... I'll do as you say.
But, I'll need time to gather
everything you want.
I can't do it all by myself.
Give me time.
Just tonight... Tonight is
all the time we'll need.
I ask that you wait. Stay here
in this mansion for tonight.
Is that acceptable?
We don't have any choice. We must
do what they want us to do.
Besides, it's only money.
If we act foolishly and make
matters worse...
...it would be like choking
ourselves to death.
It's a lousy 130,000
yen! It's cheap!
Kikui! Just what
are you...?
Forget it! I'll handle this.
This is Terauchi. Connect me
to the Cabinet Minister.
It doesn't matter. This
is an emergency!
What are you doing?! Mind your manners!
We mustn't comply with their demands, sir.
But, we don't have any other options!
We do, sir. We'll burn down the slums!
If the document and everything else is
reduced to ashes, then all will be well.
How ridiculous! That's nonsense!
How do you think the people will react?!
What will the press say?!
If we do it in order to prevent an epidemic
of the Black Death from spreading...
...everyone will think we've done our duty.
No! We can't possibly do such a thing!
Why not, sir?
They may be slums, but there
are hundreds of people living there.
And you want to burn them to death?!
Have you ever considered them human?
Why pretend that you're now a politician
who cares about the people?
Besides, you've done filthy things yourself.
Nonsense!
Your Excellency... This isn't a
simple matter of money...
...or of your personal
safety, sir.
Those scum have commenced
an attack against the nation!
As representatives of the nation, we must
not yield, no matter what threat we face.
That is the reason why...
laws exist...
...and why we

Daddy! Mommy!
Daddy! Mommy!
Shusuke! Are you all right?!
Shusuke!
Sensei!
Snowblood! Looks like this
is where your life will end.
You've evaded execution once...
but, you won't do so again.
I will finish you...
personally!
Snowblood...
Damn you...
W... Wait... Wait! Wait!
D...Don't shoot!
Shusuke... Hang
on! Shusuke!
Everyone's dead... They
were burnt to death.
Shusuke...
Yuki... will you help
me stand up...?
It's such a beautiful day, worthy of
celebrating Navy Memorial Day.
And, as certain gloomy matters
have been taken care of...
...you must be without
a care in the world.
Kikui... how can I thank you?
I understand that you've reduced
that document to ashes.
Now, I can peacefully pay respect to the
nation's great soldiers buried here...
...all thanks
to you!
Y...You!
Snowblood!
Go!
Don't run away! Protect His Excellency!
Yessir!
Attack!
Attack!
Your Excellency!
You... mad dogs!
M...Mad dogs...
Y...Yuki...
...Yuki...
Me...
Me... finish me...
It was May, 1907. The holy era of the
Meiji Restoration would soon end.
