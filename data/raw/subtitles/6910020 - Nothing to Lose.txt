BASED ON A TRUE STORY
POLICE
Out of the car! Move!
-What's going on?
-Lean against the car.
Turn around.
Dad!
Head down, sir. Head down.
Head down.
Good luck, "Bishop."
Give us the ball, Pinky!
Let me play. I've been waiting forever!
Why should we play with you?
Look at your hands!
I play with my feet, not my hands.
I can do anything you guys can.
You can play with us
if you climb that tree over there.
Pinky! Pinky! Pinky!
Pinky! Pinky! Pinky!
Pinky! Pinky! Pinky!
Pinky! Pinky! Pinky!
Pinky! Pinky! Pinky!
Please help me, God.
Please help me.
Now I want to play.
You fell! You're supposed
to climb to the top!
I did climb and I'm gonna play!
What did those kids do this time?
I hate it when they call me Pinky.
You're my sweet boy...
handsome, strong...
brave, smart.
So why did God make me like this, Mom?
All the kids in school are perfect,
all my brothers and sisters,
it's just me that's like this!
Didi, honey, God made you special.
Special? Then why won't He help me?
I asked Him to help me climb the tree,
but He didn't do anything.
It's because you weren't
supposed to climb it!
You'll do much greater things
than climb trees.
You'll climb mountains.
Of our faith, O Virgin
Bless the plea
We seek God who is our King
Stop coughing, Elcy,
show some respect!
We seek God who is our King
We seek God who is our Father
We seek God who is our King
We seek God who is our Father
We seek God...
Calm down.
Calm down, Elcy.
Calm down, it'll get better.
Calm down.
Breathe.
Breathe, breathe...
Breathe.
What a miracle! Reading the Bible?
Is God alive or dead, Dad?
What a question to ask, Edir!
Because the Bible says He's alive.
What can He do for me
when He's nailed to a cross?
He needs more help up there than I do,
than Elcy, than anybody else
in this house does.
Don't talk like that!
If the Bible's true...
it makes no sense to make people
believe in the image of a dead God.
That's what we believe in.
You shouldn't question our religion.
But what if I don't believe?
Can't I answer for myself?
Should I be forced to believe in something
that doesn't make sense to me?
Do whatever you want.
Just don't lose yourself.
I already feel lost.
It's no good, Henrique.
Nothing makes her asthma any better.
Maybe we should try
something more radical.
You may go home now. Take this to Elcy.
Repeat what I've done. She'll get better.
Thank you.
You two, stop that.
How are you feeling, Elcy?
-Any improvement?
-No. I feel the same.
We have to wait a bit, Geninha.
The changes can take time.
Getting back all that wasted money
will take time too.
STATE LOTTERY
-Tough day.
-Beer?
I think there's a dance tonight.
Kiss me
Kiss me a lot
Because I fear to lose you
To lose you later on
Kiss me
Kiss me a lot
As if tonight was the last time
Kiss me
Kiss me a lot
Because I fear to lose you
To lose you later on
-You can find peace in your life...
-Sorry to interrupt...
-Want some milk?
-Sure.
Hold on.
...all you who are weary and burdened
will find rest in Christ Jesus.
Just come to Him.
The Word of God does not fail.
You're all invited to join us
in the next prayer meeting
at our church.
Jesus hasn't changed and promises to heal
and set free all who believe in Him.
When my asthma acts up, I sit here,
listen to this and I feel better.
-What program is that?
-He's a bishop.
When he prays, it's like the air
flows back into my lungs.
I really want to go there, Edir.
Can you go with me?
BRAZILIAN PRESS ASSOCIATION
Up for a drink, Edir?
I can't, I'm busy tomorrow morning.
What, that church thing again?
Turning into one of those crazy fanatics?
How does Talita like that?
Edir, I liked you before that church!
We can't even have sex anymore.
I want to do things right, Talita.
I want to respect you,
I want to be right with God.
If you'd at least come with me to church--
Church is not for me, Edir.
I want to be free to do what I want...
to enjoy life without being tied
to any set of rules.
But there are so many wonderful things
to learn and discover there.
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.
All you care about is God,
the Bible, church.
All you talk about is faith, faith...
I'm sick of it.
I want to have fun, go to parties,
have adventures and be with a man
who thinks like me.
I want a woman who thinks like me too.
So if that's the case...
we should break up.
You're leaving me for something
you've never seen.
But I'm flesh and blood.
Good luck to you...
and your choices.
For God so loved the world...
that He gave His only begotten Son...
so that whosoever believes in Him
will not perish,
but have everlasting life.
And now, if you can't hold back anymore,
and want to meet with God here and now,
come up to the altar.
There he goes again, Mom.
I've lost count of how many times
he's done that.
You have to admit, Ester...
he seems really determined.
I pity him.
My God! It's all or nothing.
It's now or never!
I've changed my life for You, Lord.
I've lost friendships...
my girlfriend,
and even the respect I had at work.
But what's the use of converting
if I don't know You yet?
All I ever wanted was to find You.
Now I stand here before You...
Come to me, my Lord!
Hey, buddy, give me some change.
Some change.
Aren't you hungry, pal?
-Extra change.
-Come with me.
I just need some change.
Just a second.
What is this, Edir? This is a church,
not a homeless shelter.
He'll scare off our members
with that smell!
He is suffering and needs God
just as much as we do.
There's a time and place for everything.
I thought church was the right place
to save souls.
I'm not going to argue.
Please, my friend, come with me.
I'll see what I can do for you.
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.
Hi.
Hi.
You're Edir, right?
Yes, pleased to meet you.
I'm Ester.
My aunt Lydia told me you're a math tutor.
Could you help me?
It would be a pleasure.
I mean, sure.
Just tell me when and where...
and I'll be there.
Could you meet me at my class?
Saturday morning,
at the Bank of Rio building?
I know where that is.
I'll be there.
You'll see. I won't struggle
with math anymore.
I'm starting with a tutor today.
Wow! That's a lot of excitement
over a math lesson.
Hi!
-Hi, Ester.
-Hi.
-How are you?
-How are you doing?
Let's go.
Tutor, right?
What kind of tutor are you?
Teaching the language of love?
See you later, girl.
Good luck in love, I mean, in class.
You're brash!
I am.
I remember the day you started
attending church.
You remember, do you?
I didn't think you'd last.
You seemed sort of unsure.
I was. But not anymore.
Now I know exactly what I want...
for my life.
Do you?
I remember you too.
From the very first day...
You were just a girl.
But time has passed...
It's like I've been searching for you
my whole life, Ester.
Did you like the movie?
What movie?
Hi, Ester!
Carlinha! I just want to give her a hug.
-Okay.
-Excuse me.
Ester?
Hi, Mrs. Geninha, how are you?
What are your intentions with my son?
Edir and I are just dating...
getting to know each other.
You'd better not break my son's heart.
No, I would never!
She dresses like an old lady.
Don't say that.
-Girls!
-Just a sec.
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, honey.
Come with me, Ester.
Look, Edir, my mom sewed
this dress for me.
I didn't know it would be so tacky.
And your mom--
Don't listen to them, Ester.
My sisters are always like that, rude.
My mom just wants to protect me.
They're just going to have to accept you
because they'll be your family too.
That's right, Ester. I want to marry you.
-Hello?
-Edir?
Good morning, Mrs. Eunice.
May I speak with Ester?
Sorry, Edir, but she's asleep.
What? At 8 o'clock in the morning?
Sorry, darling, it's Edir.
He asked me to wake you.
Edir?
Why are you still in bed, Ester?
I only wake up early
when I have class in the morning.
That's laziness, Ester.
If you're going to be my wife,
you'll have to wake up early.
Hi.
You're an hour late, Ester!
-Sorry, Edir, traffic was awful.
-Leave earlier, then.
I'm on my lunch break,
I don't have all day!
You said to me,
"I've waited all my life for you."
Now you can't even wait one minute.
Gosh, Edir.
Seeing our new apartment
is supposed to be fun.
Exactly. But late as you are,
doesn't seem like you care.
Let's just go up.
-Wait.
-Haven't I waited enough?
We're moving too fast.
-You mean the apartment?
-I don't think I can marry you.
I'm having doubts.
What happened?
Why this now?
Ever since you proposed,
you've been different.
Ester, I'm just the same!
No. You're bossy and angry
all the time.
Controlling my schedule,
telling me what to do.
I love you, but it makes me so worried.
You scare me when you do that.
I don't know if this is God's will.
Ester, listen to me!
Look me in the eye.
This is God's will!
I'm absolutely sure of it.
Sorry if I scared you.
It's just that...
I know you come from
a protective family, but...
I want you to be my partner
in everything.
I've told you my dream is winning souls
for God all around the world.
I know that it's going to require...
sacrifice.
You'll have to be a warrior
to accompany me.
Unless you don't want to.
I do.
You're right, Edir.
I need the same willingness
and faith as you.
Hello! To what do I owe
the honor of this visit?
Is your family well?
Everyone's fine.
I'd like to kindly request
something from you, sir.
Please, by all means.
Edir and I are getting married.
Iâ€™d like to ask you
to be a witness at our wedding.
How long ago did you set
the wedding date?
A few months ago.
Why didn't you come to me before,
to get counsel?
I'm sorry.
It all just happened so fast...
Do you accept?
I can't, Ester.
But you've known me all my life!
That's just it.
I'm not happy seeing someone
I'm so fond of marrying Edir.
He comes from a poor family,
not well educated,
so different from yours.
He's also very brash, impetuous,
nothing like you, my dear!
Not to mention that defect
he has in his hands.
Have you stopped to think
that if you had his child,
it could have a defect as well?
I can't approve of this union
and I urge you to reconsider.
I'm aware of our differences
and I'm willing to adapt.
I love Edir and he loves me.
Ester, you deserve better,
a man worthy of you!
I'm sorry.
It seems that I made
a huge mistake coming here.
Ester! Ester.
What is it?
Kill it, Ester! Kill it now!
I never thought my brave husband
would be scared of a roach!
Ester, we can't stay here anymore.
The sewer is always clogged,
the stench is awful
and now I have to deal
with these flying demons!
It really hasn't been easy living here.
Right.
What if we stayed at my parents' house?
-I don't want to be any trouble.
-Just until we find a place.
And then my mom can watch Cris...
and I can get a job, too.
Well, it won't be for long.
I'll work twice as hard
to give our family a better life.
We'll make it through!
I believe in you.
Thank you for having us.
Don't worry, it's just for a little while.
I guarantee it.
It's going to be all right, Ester.
God will provide!
Have a good day at work, dear.
Thanks, Mom.
Bye, Mommy's little cutie pie!
...that is equal to the result of dividing
the cosine with the hypotenuse.
Z is equal to the cosine plus K plus P.
Plus cosine, plus K 2 pi.
Which one are you going to play with?
This one? Which?
It's so beautiful!
Finally, our new home, honey!
All that effort was worth it.
Our girl's first steps will be here.
I'm going to turn this place
into a real home.
We'll be here a long time!
That's not my dream, Ester.
Remember when I told you
I'd preach in Africa someday...
and all over the world,
devoting myself to those in need
who still don't know our God?
But you've been helping so many people
with your evangelism.
I want more than that, Ester.
What good is a house, a car,
more money, more comfort...
if it's not what God asks of me?
But, Edir, even if God wants to use you,
you have a family, bills to pay.
You can't throw it all away.
What about me?
What about Cris?
I know, I would never leave you.
You're part of God's plan for my life.
It's just that...
so many people are suffering
who don't know about this great God.
It bothers me so much.
I want to do more!
Bishop, I'd like to do more
for the church.
I'm not asking for a job,
just the opportunity to help people.
You're still not ready, son.
But, Bishop, I--
Listen carefully.
Never forget what I'm going to say.
Before Jesus proclaimed,
"Go into all the world
and preach the gospel to all nations,"
He said many other things in the Bible.
That's the last chapter of Mark,
but to get there,
you have to start from chapter one.
Understand, Edir?
I beg of you, Bishop!
This call to preach is eating away at me!
Please, let me help those in need!
Edir, you know that's not how it works.
There's a hierarchy in the church.
I don't understand!
I want to serve God,
I don't get why my church won't
support or let me serve!
Nobody cares about your opinion.
It's the way things are!
In that case, from now on,
I won't be attending services here
so I can go win souls out there.
Edir, wait!
Ester, this is just a flash in the pan.
Convince your husband to stay
in the church and leave things be.
He'll come around.
My husband doesn't just give up, Bishop.
Even more so when he's called by God.
Enough! No more praising God
and not doing His will!
I'm going to save the souls
that need saving,
-even if I'm not in a church.
-But you don't have to leave...
Edir, you're speeding!
I can't keep going to a church
that won't help people out there.
Edir! Stop!
You're not going to make it!
I have to make it, Ester!
Edir, stop this car!
I told you I'd do it, didn't I?
Pull over this instant!
I know you're frustrated,
but don't endanger your family like that.
Relax, Ester, it wasn't that bad.
I'm pregnant again.
One thing you have to admit.
I was right, this time.
I said I'd make it, and I did!
Pregnant?
Congratulations!
What wonderful news, brother.
I have some more good news
for my brother-in-law.
The church is called
The Eternal Path Crusade.
It's still starting out,
but I know it'll be great.
When I heard you'd left
New Life Church as well...
I thought of asking you
to be my treasurer,
manage all of our bookkeeping.
But Soares, that's what I do
at the Lottery.
I want to preach the Gospel,
not crunch numbers.
You'll do more, Edir.
I'll give you the opportunity
to make services,
when the time is right.
We'll work hard in poor neighborhoods
to draw in crowds.
That's exactly what I want!
To help these people!
My friend, God has heard my prayer!
EXPLICIT SEX
ETERNAL PATH CRUSADE
GRAND OPENING
DAILY SERVICES
9 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 8 PM
Edir, introduce me to the people
as the great missionary pastor,
R. R. Soares.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for coming.
I'd like to ask you to stand
and welcome our great pastor,
the missionary, R.R. Soares!
We can't lose hope, Soares.
We need to persevere.
I refuse to preach to so few people.
It's a waste of my time and energy.
But isn't one saved soul a great victory?
You're always so excited.
If you're so excited about
half a dozen people,
-why don't you preach?
-But that's what I want!
I don't think he can handle this.
He can barely hold the mic!
Afternoon, everyone!
Please, come up here...
Come here, close to me.
Please come.
Come closer.
Listen closely.
The Lord Jesus said...
where two or three are gathered
in His Name,
He will be there with them!
Jesus is here.
-Do you believe?
-Yes.
So close your eyes.
Let's talk to God.
I'd like to thank Pastor Samuel
for inviting us to his home.
I'm very pleased with the dedication
of all of you.
After so much hard work,
the church is beginning to grow
and we should celebrate
this great accomplishment.
I'm particularly grateful
to my wife, Madalena,
who gives me strength
to carry on this journey,
and to Pastor Samuel.
I'd also like to say a few words,
if you don't mind.
Of course, Edir.
I've been waiting a long time
to share this news.
Ever since I found God,
it's been my dream to preach the Gospel
to people everywhere.
And so, Ester and I...
Come here, Ester.
We're planning to leave our jobs...
and dedicate 100 percent
of our time to God's work!
Listen, Edir.
I'm sorry, we respect your intentions,
but you lack the calling
for God's work.
We think you should keep
your job at the Lottery
so you can support your family.
To be a pastor you need more
than good intentions,
you need talent.
That's why my congregation here in Rio
is packed with people.
But you preach to ten or 20 people,
never more than that.
All you have is a group
of old ladies and beggars.
Nothing more.
Now, let's join hands
and give thanks to God
for all He's done for us.
Glory to the Father,
who through His Son, Jesus Christ,
has given us the privilege
of gathering here in His Name.
Father!
Father...
Thank you, Father!
Thank you, Father!
They were so mean to you, Edir.
God confirmed that He's with me, Ester.
He confirmed my calling.
God has honored me!
God has said yes to you.
FLUMINENSE MATERNITY HOSPITAL
They won't let me see Viviane, Edir.
The nurse keeps stalling,
saying they took our baby
for the Guthrie test
and then for a bath,
but it wasn't like this
when Cris was born.
They don't want to show me
our daughter, Edir!
I'm scared.
Please try to find out what's going on.
-Where's the nursery?
-I'm sorry, sir--
I want to see her.
Viviane, daughter of Edir and Ester!
Take me there now!
-Mr. Macedo?
-Yes.
I'm the doctor who delivered
your daughter. Please...
Tell me already! Is she dead?
No, sir.
Your daughter was born
with a serious physical defect,
a congenital malformation.
Nurse, please, have Mr. Macedo
and Mrs. Ester's baby brought here.
It's called a cleft lip and cleft palate.
She won't be able to breastfeed
or talk like other children.
She'll require many operations
to try to correct the problem.
Our staff believes she'll need at least
ten surgeries in the coming years.
And the first has to be done
in a few months,
while she's still a baby.
And even so,
she may never speak normally.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Macedo.
You can take her.
Wait.
I'd like to speak to Ester first.
You'd better not see her now, Ester.
It's a horrible deformity.
I want to see my baby,
I don't care if she's ugly or pretty.
I need to see her.
Okay...
but be calm.
You'll have to be strong.
Please take her.
Will she be back later?
Ester, I can't bear to see my daughter
suffer as I did as a child.
I know, Edir...
but she's our baby, she's our family.
My God, now I understand.
Now, more than ever,
I feel the pain of people in suffering...
and for their sake, I'll give my all.
I'll invade hell if I have to,
to save every lost soul!
From today on, nothing will stop me
from fulfilling Your will and my mission!
It's all or nothing!
Nobody's going to hold me back, nobody!
Enough!
That's it.
I can't take it anymore!
It's now.
I place myself 100 percent
at Your disposal, my God...
as I never have before.
And if no church or person
believes in me...
I'll go alone...
I'll rely only on You, Lord,
to save others.
-You're resigning, Edir?
-Yes.
Are you sure you're doing
the right thing?
God won't forsake me.
Goodbye.
If the troubles of this life
Are trying to pull you down
Take hold of Jesus' hand
And go
If the sadness of this life
-Is trying to break your heart
-"Take hold of Jesus' hand..."
Take hold of Jesus' hand
And go
Take hold of Jesus' hand
Take hold of Jesus' hand
For He, He will lift you up
Why are you here?
God has brought you here...
and He wants to change your life!
No matter your religion...
no matter what you have
or haven't done.
God wants to manifest in your life!
Just believe what it says here!
Either He's God, or He isn't.
Either the Bible is the truth or a lie.
God is a Father!
Any father wants the best
for his children.
God's will is for you
to have the best of this Earth!
And for that, you have to throw yourself,
body, soul, and spirit,
into what is written in His Word.
If just believing in God were enough,
the world would be great!
Isn't that right?
-Yes or no?
-Yes.
You have to believe in God
and in yourself!
This act of faith
makes all the difference in your life.
Faith requires action!
I'd rather die
than believe in a big God...
and live as though I believed
in the Devil.
I can't accept that.
This is my faith.
It's not enough just to believe,
you need faith.
Go all the way with this word.
Anyone feeling God's presence?
I'm not feeling anything.
But I'm absolutely sure
that God is here.
This is what you call faith!
It's one thing to feel,
it's another to be sure!
There are problems that can't be solved
with counseling and medicine.
They're spiritual problems,
and these problems
can only be solved through faith.
It's written that the thief,
who is the devil,
comes only to steal,
to kill and to destroy.
But Jesus said:
"I come so you may have life...
and life to the full."
Think, people!
If your life has been a failure...
it's because an evil force
has been preventing you from being happy!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thank you!
You've helped me so much.
It's God, my friend!
-Albino.
-Edir Macedo.
I saw you at the meetings
in the old movie theater.
But the other pastors don't pray
with the same passion as you.
Do you need any help?
You talked about casting out
evil spirits.
Yes.
My wife, Maria, she's been suffering
since she was a teenager...
tormented by a lot of bad stuff.
Do you think she'd come here
to the bandstand?
No way. She won't leave the house.
Let him in, dear.
Help, Edir, help!
She's stiff as stone!
Almost lifeless.
This evil is going to leave!
Lift her body!
She's mine! Mine!
We'll see about that!
You will leave her body!
Put her hands behind her!
I command you, evil spirit,
to leave this life and never return.
In the Name of the Lord Jesus!
This evil is gone.
Albino, what happened?
You were sick, Maria.
This is Pastor Edir,
he came to help you.
I... don't remember anything.
Don't worry, my love.
All that matters is that you're okay.
What I saw today, Edir, was a miracle.
And you say you're not a pastor?
How is that possible?
I'm not an ordained minister...
but a title is not what I want.
I want to win souls.
And what do you need to do that?
I'm looking for a place.
Somewhere people who need help can gather.
-A place.
-Yes.
It's up for rent, for a good price.
-Paulo, this is Edir Macedo.
-Nice to meet you.
This is it.
The funeral home's chapel.
Isn't this just what you're looking for?
It's perfect!
Albino, this is exactly what I want.
We can rent it.
Paulo spoke to the landlord.
But you'll need a co-signer.
If my house were paid off,
I'd be glad to help you.
Is anyone else interested?
No visits this week.
-Can you hold it for us?
-Sure, no problem.
God has given us
a great opportunity today.
I have faith in that!
Honey, what a wonderful surprise!
Lots of visitors today.
Romildo and Madalena
came to see your dad.
How is he?
He has good days and bad days.
Can I talk to you?
In private.
God just blessed me, Mom.
He gave me a chance
to finally have our own place...
where I can help people every day.
That's wonderful, my son!
But I need a co-signer so I can rent it.
How will you pay the rent, Edir?
You have to think of your family.
God won't forsake me.
I'm absolutely sure that He's the one
guiding me in this decision.
I believe in you, my son.
I always have.
If you're sure this is the way,
I'll help you.
Thank you, Mom!
-God bless you.
-Amen.
Edir...
Did I hear that right, Mrs. Geninha?
This is insanity!
Your son can't afford the rent,
you'll be homeless.
I believe in my son, Romildo.
And I'd be very happy if other people
in this family did the same.
I like Edir, Geninha,
but I'm worried about you.
It's settled, Romildo.
And hasn't anybody told you
that it's rude to eavesdrop?
JESUS CHRIST IS THE LORD
UNIVERSAL CHURCH
OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
-Is your wife really pregnant?
-She is.
Name him Moses if he's a boy!
Moses...
All right, people, let's get to work!
Hand this out to everybody you meet
from now until Saturday,
day one of the Universal Church
of the Kingdom of God!
Praise God!
Let's all stand.
Close your eyes
and let us enter the presence of God.
My God and my Father,
in Jesus' Name,
I ask You, Lord, to manifest Your Power...
in the lives of every person here.
Come free the oppressed,
the sick, and the needy
who came here today,
for I know that You are here...
and want to transform
these people's lives!
Albino, Paulo!
-Hey!
-Have you heard this one?
The solution to your situation
and a powerful love charm.
I can bring your loved one
back in seven days.
You can have good luck
because this saint doesn't fail!
Can you believe this?
BabÃ¡ Ivete's had this radio show
for a long time.
-I've heard about her.
-Me too, Edir.
I have an idea.
Hello, my friends and listeners,
may God bless you abundantly
in the Name of the Lord Jesus!
Listen carefully to what is written
in the Word of God:
"Come to me, all you who are weary
and burdened,
and I will give you rest."
I don't know what problems
you've been going through,
or how long you've been suffering,
but I know one thing:
the God who I believe in
has the power to change your life.
All who used their faith
and refused to accept their situation
have been answered.
What draws God to you is not your tears,
but your revolt against your problems!
I challenge you.
If you come this Friday,
and don't experience
the power of God in your life,
I'll stop preaching the Gospel!
The time has come to end your suffering!
You are my special guest, this Friday
at 10:00 AM, 3:00 PM, or 8:00 PM
at the Universal Church
in the AboliÃ§Ã£o district,
where a better life waits for you!
May God bless you abundantly
in the name of the Lord Jesus!
I invite you to join your faith with ours.
Take a glass of water
and place it on your TV set.
Let's talk to God.
Drink of this water now...
and be healed
in the name of the Lord Jesus!
THE AWAKENING OF FAITH
PR. MACEDO
COPACABANA RADIO
THE AWAKENING OF FAITH
COPACABANA RADIO IS OURS!
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-Good morning.
We need to talk.
The leader of that cult
bought a radio station,
has a TV show and fills stadiums!
I know! An aunt of mine fell
for the sweet talk of this conman!
She gives them money,
even though she makes so little!
He deceives people
with lies and fake healings!
It's all an act!
Senator, can't you do anything
about this in BrasÃ­lia?
Can't he go to jail
for being a faith healer?
Your Honor, you need to do something!
You can receive all the blessings
you want...
but if you're not born of God,
you're lost.
It's written right here...
"For everyone born of God
overcomes the world."
JESUS CHRIST IS THE LORD
"This is the victory that overcomes
the world, even our faith."
-Amen, folks.
-Amen.
Mrs. Ester, I brought this baby for you.
What good is it to do charity,
go to church, be a nice person?
You have to be born again!
That's the truth!
Like it or not.
He's so cute...
If this world is hard
when you belong to God,
imagine how hard it is
when you don't!
No, Mrs. Ester. He's yours.
Yours and the Bishop's.
I'm giving you the boy.
What is it, Ester?
This woman says she wants us
to take her son.
She wants us to raise him.
Speak here on the mic,
in front of the whole church.
Since I found out that I was pregnant,
my husband and I have been thinking
that this baby
should be given
to Mrs. Ester and to you.
Are you sure?
Are you aware
of how serious a decision this is?
I am, Bishop. I'm sure.
Moses, of the Universal Church
of the Kingdom of God, is now born!
TWO YEARS LATER
When he became the pastor
of a small Evangelical church,
treasurer Edir Macedo left behind
the ordinary life
of a middle-class citizen
to become the spiritual leader
of thousands of people.
Minister, do you see how dangerous he is?
These healings and exorcisms,
aren't they illegal?
Legality is relative
when it comes to religion.
But if we could fabricate
a witness willing to accuse him...
We can't keep allowing him
to act with impunity.
Minister, let's use the media
to get rid of him.
I don't know,
we could call the church a cult!
I could talk to some friends,
owners of newspapers,
magazines, even TV networks.
On legal grounds, of course.
I'll think of how we can
look into this church's activities.
If we move with caution, we can do it.
Let's go, no time to lose.
Let's go.
All I need is Your touch, Lord
All I need is Your touch, Lord
All I need is Your touch, Lord
For my weary soul to overcome.
For my weary soul to overcome
What is this? What's going on?
Can't you see that our growth bothers them
because their churches are emptying out?
You're messing
with very powerful people, Edir.
The warrant for your arrest
is proof of that.
But if you show up at the Federal Police
to give a deposition,
they can't arrest you.
We're disturbing a religious power
that's long ruled Brazil.
Besides, we're doing work
that the State won't do.
That really bothers them.
-Bishop, I'm sorry to interrupt, but...
-Go on, Carlos.
The Communications Minister.
He'll only speak to you.
Minister? This is Edir Macedo.
I'll get right to it.
Please reconsider the events being held
at MaracanÃ£ and MaracanÃ£zinho.
FRANCISCO BITTENCOURT
COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER
What do you mean by that, Minister?
-Cancel the events.
-I beg your pardon?
I can't cancel them!
We booked them long ago,
people are expecting us!
Well then, just tell them!
With all the confusion of your church
under investigation,
it might seem like a provocation.
All because the Pope has an event
on the same day in Natal?
I've made my point.
I expect you to be reasonable.
For your sake, and your followers'.
-We need to go, Edir.
-Okay.
FEDERAL POLICE
REGIONAL BUREAU
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, I'm Edir Macedo,
I have an appointment.
I'm sorry, Mr. Macedo,
your appointment was canceled.
Could you check, my dear?
That's impossible.
We received official confirmation
of the appointment yesterday!
I'm not your dear, and, as I said,
the appointment has been canceled.
This is a joke!
Hello?
What is it, Edir?
They have a warrant for my arrest.
-What?
-If I do the event, they'll arrest me.
-In front of all of our people.
-Now what?
-Bishop...
-Yeah?
There's a roadblock.
Can they track the car's license plate?
No, it's a rental.
Hide yourself a little more.
We're through.
Let's go!
The crowd surpassed
the cult's expectations
and put over 250,000 people
in MaracanÃ£ and MaracanÃ£zinho
simultaneously,
the largest attendance ever recorded
since the opening
of the two largest sports arenas
in Rio de Janeiro,
much larger than the Pope's attendance
on the same day
in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte.
So...
Edir didn't go to MaracanÃ£.
What do you mean?
He was nowhere to be found.
Are you saying he escaped?
Where's the paper I need to sign?
Upon signing this document,
you authorize us
to analyze all of the church's
financial activities.
Do what you want.
All you'll find is us doing God's work.
We have nothing to hide.
Our country can't have
such a biased press
being unfair to whoever they want.
What are you thinking?
I hear Silvio Santos
and Machado de Carvalhos
are thinking of selling Record.
Imagine a major TV channel
preaching the Gospel
to late-night audiences.
A time when many are desperate,
depressed, thinking of suicide.
Just one thing, though.
They can't find out I'm the one
trying to buy it.
Is it okay if my driver stays here?
-Your driver?
-Yes.
Sure, Paulo, it'll be quick.
Last time, I told you that your proposal
doesn't interest me.
Silvio, I understand your concerns
about closing a deal of this size
without meeting the investors.
So, we've made some adjustments
to the proposal.
But we still have no guarantee
that you'll be able to make
the rest of the payments.
I admire your ambition, young man,
but I think you're in over your head.
I've had enough!
Speak, Edir.
I am Edir Macedo
and I'm behind this purchase.
Edir? What kind of joke is this?
I feared negotiations would be compromised
if you knew it was me.
Silvio, this document guarantees
the first deposit to acquire Record.
Subsequent payments will be made
according to this timetable.
I see, Edir.
But do you think you can
take on such a debt?
There are a lot of payments
and they're owed in dollars...
Think about it.
With all due respect,
I'm aware it's a huge purchase.
God will honor us.
It's nothing personal, Edir,
but I need a guarantee.
This is our offer.
If we miss a single payment...
we lose our entire investment.
Do you accept?
-We did it, Paulo! We're going to explode!
-We will!
Aren't you going to drive?
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.
Minister, any words on the acquisition
of Record TV by Bishop Edir Macedo?
If it were up to me,
this man would never have permission
to operate a TV channel in Brazil.
-One more question.
-Later.
DELAYED PAYMENTS THREATEN
RECORD TV ACQUISITION
MONTHS LATER
Edir, it's almost four in the morning!
We don't have enough
to make this month's payment.
Can we still back out?
I know we're late
on our payments, Silvio,
but we can still pay.
I just need your help renegotiating
the terms of the contract.
We just need more time.
Edir, that's not how things work,
especially in a deal this size.
You know we have
a signed contract.
I understand, but you could
cut me some slack.
I'm trying, doing everything I can.
I'll talk to my guy
Paulo Machado de Carvalho.
He's always been the owner.
Bishop, if I were you,
I'd cancel this contract.
Your name is all over the papers.
There are grave concerns
about you in Brazil.
Even if you pay everything you owe,
you won't get the license for Record.
Edir, I've heard that
many corporate groups,
and big politicians are interested
in this license.
I just know one thing...
the only way we'll lose Record
is if they walk over Jesus' dead body!
Father, Record is not for me!
You know the intentions of my heart.
You know this is to reach souls
for Your Kingdom.
I have nothing to lose
if the negotiation falls through.
Mommy's sweetheart!
Sorry we can't do more
for you on such a special day,
my darling.
With everything that's been going on...
Do you understand why?
Of course, Mom,
I don't even watch TV anymore.
Should I postpone the wedding?
Absolutely not!
It's the only thing
that still makes your father smile.
-Bishop Macedo, the quack!
-Thief!
Thief!
-You conman!
-You conman!
Cristiane, are these wedding expenses
being paid for by your church members?
Cristiane, how does it feel
to be the daughter of a thief?
Don't mind them, dear.
Today is your day and nobody
can take that from you.
I promise!
President Fernando Collor
has announced today his new plan
to curb economic inflation in Brazil.
His program is outlined in three points.
One, fiscal reform. Two, currency reform.
Three, income policy.
The set of measures presented
to Congress also includes reforms
in industrial and foreign policy.
ZÃ©lia Cardoso de Mello began the interview
by explaining the fiscal reform.
According to the Minister,
the goal is to bring public finances
back on track in 1990.
As of today, the Cruzeiro has been
created, replacing the Cruzado Novo.
Ester!
There's no change
in the number of zeroes.
-Ester!
-They're separate things.
Well, how do we convert?
-What?
-What about the Cruzados Novos
that until yesterday were Cruzeiros?
This is how they convert...
I know this plan might harm
a lot of people.
But for me...
it's a miracle.
COLLOR'S NEW ECONOMIC PLAN
This is not an idealistic option,
reality is forcing it,
and it's a majority decision
of the Brazilian people.
THOUSANDS OF BRAZILIANS LOSE EVERYTHING
WITH SAVINGS ACCOUNT SEIZURES
"The Lord bless you and keep you.
The Lord make His face shine upon you
and be gracious to you."
ECONOMISTS FORECAST WORST RECESSION
IN BRAZILIAN HISTORY
DEBTS IN DOLLAR CRUMBLES
UNDER COLLOR PLAN
"The Lord lift His countenance upon you
and give you peace."
BISHOP EDIR MACEDO TAKES OVER
DEBT-RIDDEN RECORD
COMPANY CAN'T PAY
ITS ELECTRICITY BILL
CONTRACT
BISHOP PAYS OFF RECORD IN 7 MONTHS
AND PROMISES INVESTMENTS
Today, tomorrow and forever.
-Amen.
-Amen.
COLLOR OUT!
CHAMBER VOTES TODAY
ON COLLOR'S FATE
IN FINAL ACT, COLLOR SIGNS
LICENSE FOR RECORD
You said there was no way
this permit would be approved.
The President wants revenge
against the media
for the impeachment campaign.
That's not possible!
Everybody's losing their savings
and Macedo comes out on top?
We have to admit
he has a strong spirit guide.
We can't just sit around
and let this happen.
What a wonderful service we had today.
-Are you speeding, Edir?
-No, Ester.
Then what is it?
-Dad, what do they want?
-No idea, Vivi!
Out of the car!
Out of the car!
Move. Out of the car!
-What's this?
-Lean against the car.
Dad!
Dad...
Head down, sir.
Head down. Now!
POLICE PRECINCT
-It's the Bishop.
-Bishop?
Let's go!
Good luck, "Bishop."
How are you?
How are you?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
The pleasure is mine.
-Hi, Bishop.
-Hi.
It's the Bishop. Get up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Macedo! Get up.
You've got a visitor.
Calm down, Ester.
Calm down.
How are the kids?
Worried.
Cris is even considering
returning to the US.
Tell her it'll be all right.
When do you get out?
Nobody tells me anything...
but God is with us.
I need you to do something.
Anything.
Could you bring my Bible?
Wasn't he to be arrested
in the church, during the service?
The impact would've been greater.
What matters is that he's in jail
where he belongs.
Let him sit there for a good long time.
I think we've taught that Macedo a lesson.
Unfortunately, some people
only learn the hard way.
Let's see how much his cult can handle
having their leader in jail.
Sit down, Mom.
You didn't need to come
from Rio just to see me.
My son...
you don't deserve this!
How I wish I could get you out of here!
Mom, calm down.
I'm at peace.
How's Dad?
Still sick, my son.
He's in God's hands now.
Remember when you were little,
in Rio das Flores?
Of course I do.
You couldn't even climb a tree...
but you're climbing mountains, my son.
Keep on climbing.
Bishop, you need to come with me.
I am your real friend
I strengthen you
And I will protect you
And I'll uphold you
With my righteous hand
We don't want any trouble
from your people.
But they're just singing.
It's a lot of people, Bishop.
Crowds make the police uneasy.
Anything could happen.
Nothing will. I'll talk to them.
I thank you all for your prayers.
God has given me strength
every morning...
and I'm sure that this arrest...
will be used for something greater
in the future.
Remember that all things work together
for the good of those who love God.
One day, we'll tell this story with joy
and God will be honored!
Many times, we have to crouch down low...
so that we can leap
even higher than before.
Such are the ways of God.
Is it hard? It's very hard,
but we need only to trust Him,
with all our strength...
and with all our faith.
I ask everyone who's been gathering
in front of the station...
to remain calm and peaceful.
Keep your faith alive.
I thank you for the support
of each one of you.
May God bless you all abundantly...
in the Name of the Lord Jesus!
And you claim you're not getting rich
off of the money of your followers?
Have you not seen
the documents, your Honor?
You've found nothing wrong
because we have nothing to hide.
I respect the justice system,
but I won't accept what's being done
to me and to the church.
You will not address me in that manner!
There are still many questions
about the rapid expansion of your church.
Doing all that you have done
requires substantial funding.
Your Honor, people give their offerings
because they are blessed by God in return.
I've only had one goal since I first
opened the doors of the church:
to offer these people real faith
that has the power to transform lives.
All tithes and offerings to the church
are used precisely
to spread the word of God.
Mr. Edir...
profiting from faith healing
and charlatanism is hardly admirable.
You've been using God's name
to take advantage of people!
You mean that when someone is healed
in Jesus' Name, that's charlatanism?
When people learn the truth
and use faith
to have an abundant life
as God promises,
I'm taking advantage of them?
Oh, for the love of God!
Mr. Edir, you're being accused
of the crimes
of charlatanism and faith healing
exploiting and deluding the poor
for personal gain and--
Your Honor, we haven't been
formally charged.
I therefore request
the immediate release of my client.
The defense counsel will remain seated.
Mr. Edir, how do you respond
to these accusations?
The accusations against me
are absurd, and, evidently,
a vicious attack on my character,
on my church and on my faith.
What we do in church, Your Honor,
is simply teach people
what the Bible says.
The church is a place to welcome
desperate, rejected people
who look to God for answers.
That's what led me to found
it in the first place.
Has there been a decline in the number
of churchgoers since your arrest?
I don't see why you'd ask that,
but I'm glad to say
that the opposite is true.
The churches are even more crowded
with people indignant at the prejudice
and cruelty with which
you have been treating me.
Many people have sympathized
with our struggle in the past days
and have decided to join our church.
As long as this investigation
is taking place,
you will remain detained
at Vila Leopoldina Station.
We file a writ of habeas corpus
immediately.
You have no grounds
to keep my client in custody.
Court is adjourned.
ELEVENTH DAY OF CUSTODY
-As many times as you can--
-Macedo!
Visitor.
You're being released!
The SÃ£o Paulo Criminal Court
voted in your favor, unanimously.
Seven votes to zero!
So I can go home?
We came to get you!
I brought what you asked me.
-God be with you.
-Thank you.
God bless you, my friend.
-Bless you.
-Thanks, Bishop.
God bless you, my friend.
This one's for you.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I can't wait to be home.
No. I left the church and went to jail.
I want to leave jail
and go back to the church...
and give thanks to our God.
I insist on it.
All the honor to our God.
NOTHING TO LOSE
AGAINST ALL ODDS. FOR THE GOOD OF ALL.
THREE YEARS LATER
NEW YORK
Hello?
I'm sorry to call you at this hour,
Bishop, but it's urgent.
Calm down, Paulo.
Speak slowly. What's the matter?
It's spinning out of control, Bishop.
Our people are being assaulted
in the street, kicked out of homes.
We don't know where this is headed.
It could mean the end of our church.
TO BE CONTINUED...
NOTHING TO LOSE 2
