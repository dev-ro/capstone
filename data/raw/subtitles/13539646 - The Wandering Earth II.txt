Initially,
no one minded this disaster.
It's just a wildfire,
drought,
species extinction,
and disappearance of a city
until this disaster
became closely related
to everyone.
Listen,
you didn't need guns
in this place before.
You missed the good old days.
This street
wasn't this way.
It was...
The night market was great.
It was known
as the Little Northeast of Africa.
Barbecue stalls were everywhere.
It's fine.
They're patrolling.
The kunga cakes were this thick.
There were 500,000 midges in a cake.
It was yummy.
Now, you can't even eat midges anymore.
We're here.
This is where they are.
Mr. Liu.
Mrs. Liu.
I brought Peiqiang to see you.
This kid is promising.
He passed our country's
Reserve Astronauts examination.
Next, he's preparing to go to the moon.
He's training here now.
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of him.
Chief.
Is there really a Solar Crisis?
You'll be blind.
I guess so.
They're already fighting this way.
Anyway,
Earth will be swallowed up in 100 years
and the solar system
will be destroyed in 300 years.
That's it.
What else can we do?
Slow down.
Are you ready to go to the moon?
Once you're there,
you'll be staying for 10 or 20 years.
That's great.
Our whole family
will be in the sky.
Anyway,
Earth isn't nice at all.
It's pretty nice just to be alive.
Silly kid.
Listen.
Hang in there.
Steadier!
Steady!
Did you see that?
That's the Test Engine 1
of the Moving Mountain Project.
We'll be done in less than six months.
Six months?
Can it be done in time?
Listen.
We can even build engines on the moon.
We don't even need people.
They're all automatically done,
non-stop, quick.
As long as no one sabotages it,
six months is enough.
The sun
is rapidly aging.
It continues to expand.
A hundred years later,
the sun will expand
to engulf the entire Earth.
After 300 years,
the solar system will cease to exist.
In response to the Solar Crisis
100 years from now,
A United Earth Government was established
and dozens of crisis response plans
were proposed.
To ensure that more people survive,
the Moving Mountain Project
finally decided
to build 10,000 Earth Engines
to drive the Earth
out of the solar system.
At the same time,
three satellite engines were built
to exile the moon
and guarantee
the smooth departure of Earth
from the moon's gravity.
However,
as the project progressed,
the difficulty
and high cost of implementation
intensified the impact of the interest
of all parties in the world.
Doubts,
oppositions,
and conflicts
are escalating day by day.
The crisis response plan
became the crisis itself.
The feasibility verification
of the Mountain Moving Project
is of utmost urgency.
Okay, got it.
Please wait a moment.
Excuse me.
Do we know the number of attackers?
Sorry.
Currently, 127 people from 53 countries
were arrested.
Mike.
That is a bad idea.
The darkest hour
is always before dawn.
We suggest
continuing the construction
and withstanding all distractions
and disruptions
to complete verification
as soon as possible.
Don't forget.
We only have a 13-month window.
The sun
won't wait for us.
Qiangzi.
Listen.
The environment is very dangerous.
Do your best.
Don't date,
don't marry, don't have kids.
Don't worry, Chief.
I must roam space on behalf of mankind.
Fire.
"Han Duoduo."
Is Earth nice or what?
This thing can move.
It moves when you move.
Have you had breakfast?
Yes.
You'll vomit if you ate a lot.
What?
You'll get eliminated if you vomit later.
What?
This is your first training in the air.
Don't let your vomit block your windpipes.
Get lost if you vomit.
I won't perform CPR on you.
Hello.
I'm Han Duoduo.
Low Earth Orbit Healthcare major.
Hello.
Liu Peiqiang.
I am fine. Thank you.
As the Space Elevator ascends,
you'll be
- I'm annoyed.
- at 9G gravitational force.
Earth won't go easy on you
just because you're trainees.
Check your anti-G suits.
Or your parents will end up in tears.
You're bad.
Breathe.
Pay attention to the frequency.
Scream your lungs out, kids.
You'll pass out within ten seconds.
The 90,000 km Space Elevator
is the tallest architecture
in human history.
This is your starting point to the moon.
We're counting on you
to protect mankind's future.
These three won't wake up anytime soon.
During this one-month training,
they won't get much chance to sleep here.
Breathe through the chest.
Semi-closed slow breathing, twice as slow.
Activate the electromagnetic gun.
Lock on the target.
If your hit rate is less than 70%,
get lost at once.
Next.
Give up.
I want to get rid of half of you.
Prepare your weapons.
Congratulations, you two.
You passed the first exam.
You're now chosen to be
Lunar Base astronaut trainees.
Actually, it's not important
to roam space.
Giving flowers to the one you like
is important.
You're so corny.
Another 15 degrees
and it's perfect.
Hi.
Flower delivery?
Who is it for?
Do you want me to deliver it for you?
It's for you-know-who.
Who?
- Go away. Get lost.
- If you want...
Get lost.
I can deliver it
when you've made up your mind.
Anyway,
I'm here.
I'm always here.
Hey, you.
Did you see Liu Peiqiang?
Liu Peiqiang.
No.
Nov?
Simultaneous interpretation online.
You're dropping off new trainees too?
Don't embarrass our school.
You bastard.
Call me by my full name.
It has been years and we both lost weight.
You don't look the same.
What's going on?
Open the door.
As the light of Earth,
I should've gone to the moon last year.
But they made me teach another batch.
Mr. Wang is jealous of me.
That's right.
- It's because you're the light of Earth.
- I didn't do it on purpose.
Mr. Wang is aiming at me.
We're going to work straight from here?
Will we get overtime pay?
- I don't have an anti-G suit.
- Come on, hurry. This way.
What's going on?
- All right.
- Don't mess around.
Let's go.
Let's go, everybody...
Jeff.
Is communication back up?
The same exact name.
- They're reserve astronauts too?
- Which batch?
What does this mean?
I haven't seen them.
Hey, my foot is stuck!
Air raid!
Peiqiang!
Liu Peiqiang!
I quit, so you can't fire me.
Give it to her.
Give her your name tag.
How did they get in?
Open the door first.
Calling Control Tower!
I'm sorry.
All communication is cut off.
All communication is cut off!
Liu Peiqiang!
You fool, let me out!
Let me out!
I can't hear you!
- Liu Peiqiang!
- Liu Peiqiang.
You can't defeat them.
We're not regularized yet.
We don't have medical insurance.
My earpiece is broken.
I don't understand.
But I get it.
Even if I'm the only one left,
I'll guard the Space Elevator
with my life.
It seems that you don't get it.
What I mean is
we shouldn't have opened this door.
Air Defense Mode 1, got it!
Remove the safety!
First launch.
Target locking failed.
They're all fucking allies.
The ones on the radar are allies.
Cut the crap.
I'm locked as a target.
I can't shake them off.
Nov, shake them off now!
I'm working on it.
The sky is full of people.
Why only go after me?
There are too many of them.
Too fucking many!
Help! Mom, I want to go home!
What should I do?
The drones' vortex won't last long.
You have a big oil tank.
Wear them out!
Then what?
Kovochur.
God!
Ura!
I was the best in school for a reason.
Stop showing off. Backup is here.
I shook them off!
Daddy is back!
Visual attack.
Kill them!
Missiles!
What the fuck are these?
Their target is the Space Elevator!
Cut the crap!
Use the tactic Mr. Wang taught us.
Go! I'll cover you.
Launch two.
Left wing damaged!
They want to destroy
all the elevator cabins!
Nov, we can't catch up to them.
It's okay, I'm faster than you.
Requesting backup!
Higher! Stronger!
Let go.
You let go first.
Awesome!
Nice!
My finger.
Duoduo!
Liu Peiqiang!
The Space Elevator must be destroyed.
Go, Duoduo!
Digital Life is
the only way out!
- In another world,
- You ruined...
we'll live
- forever!
- ...my flowers!
I'll kill you!
Stand up!
Stand!
What are you looking at?
Give me the flowers.
Duoduo.
The flower.
- Get lost.
- Okay.
What's going on?
Look at the sky. It's on fire!
The Space Station has fallen.
I repeat.
The Space Station has fallen.
Herbert.
Are you okay?
The Space Agency replied.
We still have a seven-month window.
Seven months.
Xiaoxi.
Mr. Zhou.
You want me to make
such an important statement?
Is there ever
an unimportant statement here?
Just read it
word for word.
Due to time pressure,
UEG held an emergency conference
to discuss the relaunch
- of the Digital Life Project.
- We'll continue
to firmly implement the existing plan.
Within seven months,
we'll complete the Moving Mountain Project
feasibility test.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's going on?
We call on all countries
to manage their differences.
Simultaneous interpretation is online.
...stop preparing for war.
Put more effort
into the Solar Crisis initiatives.
Let me show you something.
Right here.
In 1990,
your Voyager 1 took
this photo of Earth.
This little white dot
is our everything.
The Moving Mountain Project
would like to build 10,000 engines
in this little white dot
and take them
to a new home 2,500 years from now.
Mike.
Do you believe that?
I believe it.
My children will believe it.
My children's children will believe it.
By then,
I believe that we'll see the blue sky
and branches
full of flowers again.
Next,
what do you think you should do?
Seven months.
Two engines.
Only us.
That's not fair.
Xiaoxi.
If everything is fair,
why build this building?
In the face of crisis,
only responsibility exists.
Unity comes with a price.
The first batch of supplies is on the way.
We're counting on them
for the next seven months.
Dad.
How do I solve this?
Dad.
It's so dark over there, Dad.
It's okay.
It's fine. Our power is out.
Dad.
Dad, how do I solve this?
This is too hard.
I don't know how to solve it.
Then teach me how to braid my hair.
Tu Hengyu,
the last batch of supplies has arrived.
Come out to assemble now.
Dad.
Dad, I want a hug!
I'll hug you when I'm back, okay?
Ma Zhao.
I'll find a chance to show you
the return capsule
from our first lunar mission.
Apart from me,
that's the second light of Earth.
Seven months correspond
to the next solar maxima.
The solar wind is detrimental
to electronic equipment.
We can't work on the lunar surface
for at least a year.
Before this,
we must ignite
the lunar satellite engine
and give the world an answer.
They brought us new equipment
to help us complete the engine test.
Mr. Ma.
Say a few words.
Come on, give a round of applause.
This is 550C,
the most advanced self-sensing,
self-adapting, self-organizing,
and remoldable compiling compute core.
After connecting to the hardware,
it can generate an underlying
operating system in real time
and automatically organize
engine construction.
There are currently
three of these worldwide.
To collect automated data,
we brought this one here.
Tu Hengyu and I
are responsible
for 550C's system operation.
Okay, Mr. Ma.
I believe that with its help,
we can quickly recover
from the solar wind's impact
and guarantee the ignition test's launch.
Tu Hengyu, connect 500C
as soon as possible.
Test its compatibility
and restart damaged modules.
Mr. Ma.
You must enter your password.
Module Group 11 activated.
Module Group 27 activated.
Module Group 31 activated.
Module Group 44 activated.
DOG Cluster activated.
Printing of construction
materials resumed.
550C is so fast.
Its speed is so fast.
I brought your data card from our center.
This is the backup
when you just got back in 2037.
This concerns personal privacy.
After our center shuts down,
all participants must decide
if they want to keep a personal backup.
If you want it, sign here.
If not, I'll destroy it in front of you.
Where's your backup?
I didn't keep one.
I hope that I can truly die someday
and not become someone's digital pet.
When we're dead, we're dead.
That's the reality.
There's a level Z3 solar storm forecast
arriving in four hours.
I know what you're thinking.
In the next three months,
we must work day and night.
If the lunar satellite engine
ignition test fails,
we'll all die.
Dad.
Dad, how do I solve this?
This is too hard.
I don't know how to solve it.
Then teach me how to braid my hair.
Sure.
Mr. Ma.
Dad, you're with Mr. Ma?
Follow this.
Mr. Ma, what are you doing?
Yaya.
I have to work.
Go get some rest.
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mr. Ma.
Dad.
Where is this place?
Where's Mom?
Dad, it's so cold here.
I want a hug from you.
Dad, where's Mom?
Dad, hug me!
Dad.
Dad, how do I solve this?
In which generation
was self-awareness developed?
The 425th.
This is the real hope
of digital life research and development.
Has our center's research
really stopped completely?
Not completely,
but permanently banned in the legal sense.
If this technology becomes widespread
in this catastrophic time,
no one will be willing to live
in the real world.
After all, the temptation
of living forever in the digital world
is too irresistible for ordinary people.
- Twinkle, twinkle little star
- Twinkle, twinkle little star
- How I wonder what you are
- How I wonder what you are
Dad.
I want to have ice cream first
in the amusement park.
Do you want strawberry
or milk flavor?
I want the biggest one,
the one that's bigger than me.
Have one of each.
Your mom is the one
who always eats them in the end.
All my teeth will fall out.
- Will that be okay?
- When we get there,
I'll buy it for you.
Are you crazy?
Why didn't you bring them to the hospital?
- This isn't a hospital.
- She was brought here from the hospital.
Mr. Ma, I don't dare to sign this.
These are the center's equipment.
I'm sorry to see Yaya this way.
Her life is hanging by a thread.
This is an opportunity.
This technology isn't mature yet.
His wife is already dead.
Can't we keep some memories
for the kid's dad?
Mr. Ma.
Who will take responsibility for this?
I will.
We're only one step away
from completing the research.
Mr. Ma.
550C's hardware
has reached its limit.
Yaya has iterated
915 generations so far,
but she still only has
two minutes to live.
I want...
I want
to give her a complete life.
I know why you're showing me these,
but no.
550C can only be used
for the ignition test.
After it's done,
550A will be recovered and destroyed too.
I allowed you to use 550A before
out of sympathy.
Don't push it.
Attention, everyone!
The solar storm will hit
the lunar surface in six minutes.
Stop working at once.
Return to the base.
Is this forecast true?
Speed up.
I thought we have another hour.
Mr. Ma, Xiaoyu, where are you?
The solar storm will hit
the lunar surface earlier than expected.
Warning failure.
There's 3 km.
We still have 3 km to go.
There's an underground bunker at the base.
550C will only be safe there.
This lousy vehicle is harder to drive
than a plane.
Our life is more important.
Cut the crap, drive!
The solar storm
is about to hit us.
We'll be there soon.
Come out to unload!
Inform Earth.
A giant solar storm
is exceeding the forecasted level.
That's nonsense.
All communications are cut off.
How can we inform them?
Hurry!
Tu Hengyu.
Hurry!
Mr. Ma, the safety buckle is broken.
Why must it be broken now?
Go.
There's not enough time. Let's go!
If the oxygen supply is broken,
we'll all suffocate.
We're almost there.
Almost there.
Tu Hengyu.
Hurry!
Come on.
Remove his helmet.
The oxygen supply is cut off. Hurry!
He's suffocating. He's dying!
Hurry!
We're all still breathing.
Jesus!
Nice.
The situation now...
Right, this is the situation.
What's strange is that
none of our warning devices
sent out any warnings.
550C is totally destroyed.
Without it,
we can't accurately control
the engine's launch position.
If we forcefully ignite it...
I'll smack you.
The test is in three days.
If we miss the window, we're all doomed.
You're all out of ideas?
When will the safety buckle be safe?
I have an idea.
550A might work.
Dad.
Dad, how do I solve this?
Write four.
Write four.
You're incredible, Dad!
Yaya, be good.
I'll be back to see you.
Bye.
Bye, Dad.
Take it.
It should be enough for ignition.
I must spend a few days to modify it.
But the ignition's
computational load is heavy.
550A will be burned up.
That's why I have a condition.
Include me in the 550 series'
further development.
If you agree,
I'll give you 550A's password.
Moving Mountain Project verification.
Lunar satellite 1 test engine,
first ignition test begins.
550A connects to the ignition module.
Begin self-compilation.
Begin synchronized overwrite.
Copy.
Attention, ignition unit.
Start the ignition.
Lighter loading completed.
Underlying operating system generated.
Begin the countdown to ignition.
All personnel, evacuate now.
Mr. Ma, Hengyu.
Evacuate too.
Tu Hengyu, what are you waiting for?
Mr. Ma.
I need to confirm
what you promised me.
This is very important to me.
I want to give Yaya
a complete life.
For the sake of Mother Earth!
What are you doing?
Hurry!
Or we'll go ahead.
I'm confirming it.
If we succeed,
don't forget about Yaya.
Lunar 1 test engine ignition completed.
The moon successfully had
an angular displacement
of 0.4 nano arc seconds.
This proves
the moon could be pushed
to the target position within 20 years
Come here and watch it.
And remove
its gravitational grip on Earth.
Based on this achievement,
Earth Engine 1
will begin its trial ignition today.
If we can successfully
shift Earth as well,
the two experiments
will completely verify
the Moving Mountain Project's feasibility.
And it will bring real hope
to all mankind
in resolving the Solar Crisis.
It failed, right?
What do you tell the world now?
Earth produced
an angular displacement
of 2 pico arc seconds.
I went to get your red envelope.
- Please take a seat.
- Here?
- Is this appropriate?
- Yes, it is.
Here, have a cigarette.
I don't smoke.
I'm the groom's dad.
Your son's surname is Liu.
Why is your surname Zhang?
Under 550C's coordination,
the underground cities' construction time
is shortened by 75%,
greatly reducing
the Moving Mountain Project's cost.
The quantum computer 550 series
is developing a higher computing power
engine-specific network based on 550C.
The last batch of Space Elevator attackers
are now on public trial.
This marks the complete obsolescence
of the Digital Life Project.
You brats.
I'll show you later
what a natural-born astronaut is.
As the Space Elevator is being rebuilt,
the UEG launched
the Navigator Project construction
to provide early warning
for the Moving Mountain Project.
Europe begins to cede rights
for more 550Cs
to be used for construction.
Sooner or later,
we'll be replaced by these things.
Full automation
has replaced a great number
of industrial workers.
In the past 14 years,
through self decision-making
and automated construction,
the 550 series helped us
complete 5,321 engines.
The Underground City Quota Lottery Plan
was passed
at the UEG general assembly today.
China's delegates strongly protested
its fairness.
This lottery plan
seriously contradicts the Moving Mountain
Project's original intention.
Only half of the global population
has the chance to enter
the underground cities.
As Earth's rotation gradually stops,
we'll switch from a 24-hour time system
to a 60-hour one.
The surge in solar radiation
has led to an explosive growth
- of cancer around the world.
- We've been through hardships.
We've given resources,
time,
and even life.
At the same time, we also gained
mutual aid and solidarity.
Welcome
to Sulawesi Automated Construction Site.
It's fine.
I can just apply to be a navigator.
Our son has a slot too.
We're all invited
to safeguard
the unity of mankind together.
On behalf of China,
please allow me
to solemnly announce
the official renaming
of the Moving Mountain Project
to the Wandering Earth Project.
This photo
was received by Institute 710 in 1987.
It says,
"2044."
The source is unknown.
The second one was received
by our Ultrafast Optical
Femtosecond Lab last week.
It says,
"205807."
The source is unknown.
This information
concerns thousands
of laboratories worldwide.
I believe all countries'
intelligence agencies
received messages like this.
We speculate
that this is a kind of warning message.
We all know
what we experienced in 2044.
We hope all parties
will take it seriously.
Today is June 22nd, 2058.
What was just unveiled behind me
is the Moon Departure Monument.
Xiaoxi.
Have a seat.
Any reply
on the moon's backup plan?
Some countries raised objections.
They didn't sign it.
The main disagreement
is the strategic
nuclear weapons' donation.
I'm afraid it will end up
like 14 years ago.
Take strict precautions
and make a backup plan.
When the moon is too far to be seen,
I wonder if we'll still have
the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.
It's fine as long as we can eat mooncakes.
Preferably with meat filling.
Buddy, are you sure you're talking
about mooncakes?
You're from the North.
The people today didn't see the moon
in ancient times,
but the moon once shone on ancient people.
The moon will always stay
in people's memories
as our longing for our hometown.
As the Lunar Exile Project initiates,
let us once again
- offer our blessings to the moon.
- Ready.
A big watermelon
sliced in half.
Half for you,
half for your mom.
One half.
Come here.
Come here.
One, two.
Go. Blow on it.
These are
for you two.
I want to take photos with my phone.
I want to edit them with my phone.
I'm going to edit photos.
Mom, I want to edit photos too.
Wait, let me do it first.
Mom, let me do it too.
Be patient. Let me finish first.
- Let me edit them too.
- Wait.
Wait until I'm done, okay?
It's okay.
I won't edit them anymore.
Don't be scared.
Liu Qi, don't be scared.
It's okay.
It's fine.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
I know what you're thinking.
Do you know how many people in the world
can't get a slot
and can't enter the underground cities?
Do you know how many would want your slot?
You should be happy that
Yaya is not living in this kind of world.
Even if the Internet
has been shut down globally,
550W retains
all local area network interfaces.
If you connect Tu Yaya to 550W,
you'll be disqualified immediately.
Then you'll be imprisoned.
What about my daughter?
I haven't seen her in 14 years.
Yaya is already dead.
That's reality.
No.
Yaya isn't dead.
I don't agree
with your view on digital life.
I've waited 14 years.
I'm old.
Even if I go to the underground city,
how many more 14 years do I have?
Dad.
I want to have ice cream first
in the amusement park.
Do you want strawberry
or milk flavor?
I want the biggest one,
the one that's bigger than me.
Have one of each.
Your mom is the one
who always eats them in the end.
All my teeth will fall out.
Will that be okay?
If Yaya can successfully connect to 550W,
it will be a milestone
in digital life creation.
There,
she'll have a complete life.
And your name
will be written in history.
If you initiate Yaya, you'll die.
If you don't do anything, you'll live.
It's your choice.
Navigator interviewees,
pay attention to the number called.
Don't linger in the hallway.
Hello, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.
I'm the Manned Orbital Space Station
Control System,
550W's offline version.
Quantum size 8,192.
The most powerful computing hardware
in the history of mankind as of now.
According to prior evaluation,
all of your flight records
and exam grades are impeccable.
I think you have a great chance
to be stationed
at the Navigator Space Station.
Thank you.
I've longed for the space
since I was a kid.
I hope to roam it on behalf of humanity.
To better understand each other,
I'm very interested to know
what your first impression of me is.
Five.
Four.
- Three.
- Why do you only have one eye?
I have two versions of the answer.
The one with a great sense of humor
is it's easier to focus with one eye.
Then I can look at you better.
Ha, ha, ha.
This sense of humor...
is just right.
The official answer is
this is my ToF radar unit.
At the same time,
it can mobilize all networked devices
to carry out
multi-angle data information collection
such as biological indicators
and related data on the target.
For example,
you're married
with a son.
Three years ago, your wife
got type II radiation sickness.
She recently got Lynch syndrome.
Under these circumstances,
your best option should be
to give up the selection
and take care of your family.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Since ancient times,
loyalty and filial piety
can't both be satisfied.
Please pay attention.
In your next answers,
metaphors, rhetorical questions,
and allusions

to leave my family behind.
But this is something I must do.
By "something you must do,"
do you mean you're forced
to do this job?
Five.

You all obviously know everything.
Why must you still do this?
Second warning.
Metaphors, rhetorical questions,

I got a slot.
But my wife and son didn't.
As long as I get selected
for the Space Station,
my son can become a preferred person.
My wife can also
enter the underground city with my son
as the guardian of a minor.
I just want my family to live on.
Dad.
What about your other family member?
What do you mean?
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.
Your father-in-law, Mr. Han Zi'ang,
didn't get a slot too.
What about Mr. Han Zi'ang?
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Response time limit exceeded.
Your best option
is to let Mr. Han Zi'ang
become the guardian
to take Liu Qi to the underground city.
Based on your wife's vital signs,
her life will end after 84.3 days.
Fuck you all! I...
You failed the stress response test.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Go to Number 19.
I'm sorry.
Sir.
Can I try again?
You didn't pass the exam.
Sir.
I was too nervous at the interview.
I'm not usually like that.
- Please, give me another chance.
- This exam
is very important to everyone here.
Don't affect them, okay?
I really need this chance.
I really need it.
Everyone only gets one chance here.
Do you have a mistress
on the moon or what?
You're so eager to see the moon go.
He does, she was his university classmate.
Nonsense, it's not her.
Who is it then?
Listen.
The moon is just pushed yearly
by 10,000...
10,000, right?
10,000 km.
It will be a long wait.
Listen up, everyone.
Don't panic.
Maintain order.
The weather is cold.
Line up properly.
There's enough for everyone.
Hold on to your cards. All right?
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- Maintain order.
I guarantee,
- everyone can get their supplies.
- It's cold, my son can't take it anymore.
My son has a fever. Can we switch places?
Come here, I'll switch with you.
- Those at the back, line up properly.
- Your turn.
- Comrade. What are you doing?
- Take it.
Please line up properly.
Everyone is lining up.
- Meritorious service in 2044?
- Don't let people cut in line.
- My wife's undergoing chemotherapy.
- Here are your fruits.
- Next.
- Thank you.
- Next.
- Please.
- Take it.
- This is yours.
- Next.
- Maintain order.
Liu Qi.
Mom, you eat first.
Focus on your interview.
You'll make it.
Honey.
Today, I just
really missed you.
A lot.
Very much.
It's okay.
I'm here.
I'm always here.
Peiqiang.
I want to go back home.
Go back
to Shanghai?
I know that place is already...
I'm just saying it.
I'm just saying it.
Dad.
Dad, how do I solve this?
Where are you, Dad?
It's like there are many of you
in the back.
Is there a mirror behind you?
Dad, why are you crying?
Dad, what's wrong?
Why did you age so much?
Don't cry, Dad.
Did I do something wrong?
I miss you so much.
A lot.
Very much.
Aren't we going to the amusement park?
Where's Mom?
It's right ahead.
The third room.
Dad, where is this place?
I want to go out.
One moment.
Dad, I want to go out.
Dad, where is this place?
I want to go out.
Dad, where am I?
- I want to go out!
- Don't be scared.
I'm here.
Tu Hengyu, open the door.
Open up.
Dad, I want a hug.
Here you go.
Wait for me.
Tu Hengyu, what are you doing?
Stop it.
Tu Hengyu.
Come out.
Yaya just needs 87 seconds now
to form self-awareness.
This is just the result
of iterative evolution.
No.
This is your narrow understanding
of digital life.
This actually proves
that Yaya is alive.
She's gone.
- You're committing a crime.
- Dad, how do I solve this?
Yaya can only live for two minutes.
I want to give her a complete life.
You got a slot.
You have a long future ahead.
Live in reality.
Dad, who are you talking to?
Yaya is already dead.
She's not!
She's not!
This is reality.
No.
No.
You're not qualified to define
what reality is.
Hurry.
Mr. Ma, step back a bit.
Yaya will surely live on.
Technician!
Technician!
Get all the technicians here!
Do everything you can
to shut down Engine 1.
At this rate, it will explode.
Dad!
Dad!
Don't hurt my dad.
My dad is a good person.
Take him away.
The suspect is under control.
Dad, where are you going?
Mr. Ma.
I want my dad.
Dad.
Mr. Liu.
The application for jet use
has been specially approved by the boss.
And he wants to send his regards
to your wife.
Thank you, buddy.
I'll buy you drinks when I get back.
Hello, Mrs. Liu!
- Hi, Mrs. Liu.
- Hi, Mrs. Liu.
- It must be hard on you, Mrs. Liu.
- Hi, Mrs. Liu.
- It must be hard on you, Mrs. Liu.
- Thank you, guys!
Peiqiang.
You haven't flown in years.
Can you still do it?
Keep it steady.
Liu Peiqiang!
Are you riding a bike?
Go faster!
Peiqiang.
This way.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Whenever I couldn't sleep
when I was little,
I would sit here and look at the moon.
I think
my chances aren't good.
I already have a plan.
If you don't get selected,
go down
and live well.
If you get selected,
our dad will bring our son
to the underground city.
I won't occupy the slot.
Also,
when my time comes,
don't stick a bunch of tubes on me.
Peiqiang.
Don't be scared.
I'm here.
I'm always here.
Sir, the lunar engine's operating system
has been overwritten.
The code
is similar to
the 2044 Space Elevator attack.
We tried to overwrite
the operating system with 550W,
- but access was denied.
- Who did it? Who exactly did it?
Do we have any staff on the moon?
Xiaoxi.
Is that a seagull?
I haven't really seen one, Mr. Zhou.
Earth stopped rotating for so long.
How did it survive?
Watch out!
Urgent call of duty?
Dad, look. The moon is suddenly shining.
This is too hard.
Yes.
Father, look.
This is bad.
Dear.
Look at this.
What's going on?
Did you hear what happened?
Yes.
I did.
CSST has sent back a video.
Broadcast it.
Lunar 3 has exploded too.
The moon is off its orbit
and crashing into us.
We should have 221 hours left.
Less than four days.
What are we waiting for?
Initiate the Earth Engines now.
Earth is still here.
It will be destroyed if we initiate them.
Besides, our Earth Engine construction
is only two-thirds completed.
So we'll just wait to die?
Our country is opening up
all underground cities
to maximize the safety of people
in our territory.
We're informing you of our decision
to open up underground cities.
We're not asking for your advice.
Salute.
There's no need for the lottery.
You can directly qualify
to live in the underground city.
After I leave,
you'll be Liu Qi's sole guardian.
This is also the only way
for you and Liu Qi to survive.
All right.
Stop talking.
I'm sorry.
Chief.
Have you been well?
Yes.
Mr. Zhou.
The image you requested is ready.
Okay.
It's almost time.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. President.
Delegates.
Everyone around the world.
This is
a piece of fossil from 15,000 years ago.
It's a fractured human femur that healed.
It is the symbol of the birth
of human civilization.
15,000 years ago,
a thigh fracture is fatal.
Because you wouldn't be able
to avoid danger and forage.
You can only wait in place
to be eaten by wild beasts.
However,
this femur
healed.
It means that after he got hurt,
someone dressed his wound.
Someone provided him with water and food.
Someone protected him
from the attacks of wild beasts.
This kind of interaction
and solidarity
enabled us to survive
and continue civilization.
In 2044,
after the Lunar Exile Project
experiment succeeded,
we once proposed a backup plan.
Detonate our nuclear weapons
on the moon's surface
in a phased array,
triggering lunar nuclear fusion,
self-explosion, and disintegration.
The delegates here
from 33 countries
received
the same message as I did.
This is
the exact number
of deployable nuclear weapons worldwide.
It's also the total number
of nuclear weapons required
to trigger lunar nuclear fusion.
These numbers were once top secret,
but they're pointless now.
I don't know the source and intent
of this information.
But it seems
to be reminding us of something.
15,000 years later,
if another fractured femur
is in front of us,
will we still make
the same choice
as they did 15,000 years ago?
Your slot in the underground city
is canceled.
It's fine, Mr. Ma.
I proved
that I was right.
Does it matter?
To Yaya,
it matters a lot.
Is Yaya, who got a complete life,
an angel
or a demon?
Mr. Ma.
Don't worry.
As long as there's enough time...
There's no more time.
The Lunar Exile Project failed.
Earth must set off immediately.
To control the Earth Engines worldwide,
we need to restore the Internet.
After we stopped rotating,
the sea water flooded
the root server in Beijing.
It's extremely difficult to reboot it.
Why me?
According to the logs,
1.7 seconds after Yaya
was successfully uploaded,
the lunar satellite engines
started to overload.
I don't think that was a coincidence.
Then can I
decline?
I don't think you will.
Our mission this time
is to set up nuclear bombs on the moon.
Step forward when you're called.
Peter Walsh.
Here!
Neil Drofa.
Here!
Don't worry.
- It has already been arranged.
- Liu Peiqiang.
Here!
- Chief.
- Nov.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
They're chosen based
on their flight exam results.
You won't get to go even if you want to.
Just wait.
Chief.
I must go.
My son is down there.
I need to be stationed here.
The Lunar Crisis response plan
has three steps.
First step.
Transport the world's nuclear arsenal
to the moon using the space station.
In a phased array,
set them up in the Campanus Crater,
which has a diameter of 46 km.
Enter the bomb set-up position.
All bomb setup personnel,
prepare for departure.
Be sure to complete the mission
before entering the Roche limit.
Second step.
Connect all the nuclear weapons.
Using the Space Station
as a relay satellite,
detonate them remotely.
It will trigger lunar nuclear fusion,
causing the moon to collapse
and disintegrate.
Headquarters has received the encrypted
data of all nuclear weapons worldwide.
To remotely detonate them,
these must be split, decrypted,
and serially connected.
Thank you.
These data have been created
between 1945 to 2045.
Different countries
used different encryption systems.
Regular decoding
would take at least ten years.
But we only have half a day
to string them together.
Third step.
Reboot the root servers
in Dulles, Tokyo, and Beijing.
Restore the Internet
to initiate the Earth Engines worldwide,
evade the lunar debris,
and embark on a new journey.
After the nuclear bombs go off,
we only have 30 minutes
to ignite the Earth Engines.
Otherwise, we can't escape
the lunar debris.
The engines' private network
isn't completed yet.
The only way to ignite it
is to restore the Internet.
This is the key to restore the Internet.
The password is 30,000 random numbers
generated in real-time.
Only this can access the Internet
and connect all engines.
Once the engines are connected,
550W will rewrite their operating systems
to standardize the ignition command.
I brought you what you asked for.
Thank you.
Benben.
This is a waterproof spray.
It forms a thin film
on the object's surface
to achieve a strong
hydrophobic effect and...
You can write
anything else you want to say.
Thank you.
I don't know who to write to.
Hurry, sync up.
Check the equipment.
Underwater docking cable installed.
Contact the commander!
Prepare to go into the water!
Mr. Zhou.
They've connected
the nuclear weapons worldwide.
We have 12 hours before the moon falls.
The rain stopped.
Let's begin.
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.
Most satellites were destroyed
by the moon's debris.
I called my daughter.
I couldn't reach her.
I'm here, don't worry.
I'll take good care of you.
The diving suit is made of aluminum alloy.
It's 240 kg in weight
and 2.1 m in height.
With the foot control thruster,
control your direction
through the foot pedal device.
Mind your depth.
Check residual air every five minutes.
Pay attention
to the pressure gauge warning.
That is the lighter transporter.
You're going down there soon.
Are you scared?
Begin nuclear weapons decryption.
Unencrypted count, 3,143.
We have 12 hours until the moon
reaches the Roche limit.
The countdown starts now.
Inform all airships to prepare for launch.
Communication equipment testing completed.
Final checks.
Prepare to go into the water.
Benben!
You're a military dog!
Big Sale
Things finally got cheaper.
Mr. Ma.
What are these?
Hair tails.
When they sleep, they stay vertical.
Transport vessel 34 has set off.
The estimated arrival
to the designated position is 35 minutes.
Direction adjustment done.
Vision is normal, speeding up.
I'm doomed.
- Mom, come and protect me.
- Don't get distracted. Focus.
God, let me have another nshima, okay?
Emilia.
Advance.
Designated coordinates reached.
Initiate bomb setup mode.
Engage autopilot.
Set the uniform flight speed
to 180 km per hour.
550W will assist in setting up
the nuclear bombs
in their accurate positions.
The energy required
to completely destroy the moon
is 1B times the total yield
of nuclear weapons.
The bombs we've gathered
can barely count as a lead wire.
So the placements must be accurate
to ensure the phased array
element focus point is accurate.
Hurry, I think it won't hold for long.
Let's go down the elevator entrance.
It's on the 17th floor below.
Good thing it's not the 18th.
Upon scanning,
there's a cavity area
on the 17th floor below.
Remember to turn off
the propulsion system to save power.
Third remaining oxygen level check.
That's the power distribution room.
Cai, go with Benben to restore power.
Xu, come with us
to the central control area.
Here it is.
Benben, go and help.
Benben, pull the cable in.
The power is back.
This is the world's biggest
liquid-cooled server cluster.
This is the real new world.
The card still doesn't work.
Lock it, hurry.
This is a high-pressure door.
It won't hold for too long.
Force feedback overload.
I can't hold on any longer.
My leg!
Almost there.
Five nuclear bombs left.
Liu.
We can finally go home.
We've lost contact
with Transport Vessel 10.
Sir, we lost contact
with Transport Vessel 33 too.
Confirm if there are survivors.
I need to confirm if there are survivors.
Continue calling it.
We've lost 384 warheads in total.
Redundancy at negative four.
The phased array
fell below the critical value.
The moon's nuclear bomb setup progress
is 95% complete.
Stop dawdling.
Speed up!
Three hours
before reaching the Roche limit.
Find a first-aid kit.
He's seriously wounded.
We must send him up at once.
Cai, come to the Central Control Room.
Prepare to pull out.
I'll be right there.
Hello?
- Can anyone hear me?
- Liu Peiqiang.
You're very low on oxygen.
Hang in there.
Our mission isn't complete yet.
The system indicates
that five vessels have crashed,
including ours.
- Two survived.
- Mom, I want to go home.
The number of nuclear bombs we have
is below the detonation threshold.
The other survivors
went to set up the nuclear bombs.
We must find a way
to set up these five too.
The emergency return capsule is ahead.
Liu Peiqiang.
Check if any lunar rovers in the base
can be used.
Two bars of power left.
Great.
Leave first.
I've already set the automatic return.
We still have five nuclear bombs to set up
- in our mission.
- Don't worry.
We trained for so long in Libreville.
We have good teamwork.
Liu Peiqiang.
We're not regularized yet.
We don't have medical insurance.
I know.
I won't be needing it.
Liu Peiqiang!
Why did you close the door again?
Liu Peiqiang!
What are you doing?
You don't need
two people for five nuclear bombs.
There are only three seats.
It's not enough for me.
Go home.
Your daughter is waiting for you.
Liu Peiqiang.
You still don't get it.
Without any tools,
how can you carry the five nuclear bombs?
Liu Peiqiang!
Come back!
Two hours and ten minutes left.
Why claw at it? Get a knife, idiot!
Stop looking.
Only one diving suit is left.
If we can't finish the work here,
we'll all die.
Headquarters.
The wounded has arrived
at the root server's gate.
Please receive them.
Initiating An Automatic Return Program
Sir, I received
a return signal from the moon.
Provide the Space Station
return coordinates.
Access the Navigator Space Station
return coordinates.
Our relay base station
is on the transport boat.
He's out of communication range.
He'll probably
die a quiet death on the moon.
Hurry.
I'll reboot the root server.
Physically connect 500W
and the root server.
Once they're connected,
let 550W into the Earth Engine
control the network.
It will perform real-time analysis
of the Earth Engines worldwide
and generate a temporary operating system.
The door is broken.
Why must it be broken now?
Backup Team 1 reached
the designated position.
Push!
Backup Team 2 will arrive in 15 minutes.
Backup Team 3 will set off in 15 minutes.
Mr. Ma.
The progress is stuck.
It can't be recovered.
Without hardware support,
you can't recover anything.
There's still one unconnected.
It's too fucking cold.
After two hours,
the moon will breach the Roche limit.
We must detonate the nuclear bombs ASAP.
After detonation,
we must ignite the engines
within 30 minutes.
Once the lunar debris
breaches the Roche limit,
we won't be able to escape.
Everything on the surface of Earth
will be destroyed.
I understand.
But we need 13 more nuclear bombs to...
Ms. Hao.
Should we...
At a time like this,
nowhere is safe.
We've lost contact with Backup Team 1!
Mr. Ma.
The hardware connection is done.
I'll be out at once.
Last set of passwords.
Tu Hengyu!
Come here!
Hurry! My leg is stuck.
Tu Hengyu, hurry!
Benben, come and help me!
Tu Hengyu, hurry.
Tu Hengyu.
Catch!
Last set of passwords.
Remember.
A civilization without humans
is meaningless.
The moon is getting closer.
No pushing!
Stop pushing!
You know it's too hard.
All nuclear bombs came
from different models,
eras,
and countries.
Get to the point.
How much longer do you need?
The moon's nuclear bombs are all set up.
We need
at least 714 hours.
Mankind...
used the most sophisticated
security system
on destroying each other.
Sir.
We have another backup plan.
This is a mechanical detonator
for a nuclear bomb.
There are 81 models in total.
For each nuclear bomb we detonate,
ten more around it
can be triggered.
The hydrogen bombs
need to be detonated one by one.
So
we need
219 people for this operation.
To guarantee our success,
we need 300 people.
Our docking modules
aren't landing crafts.
So I only have a one-way ticket.
I'll go!
I'm in!
I'll go!
I'm in!
- I'll go!
- I'm in!
- I'll go!
- I'll go!
- Let me go!
- I'll go.
Let me join!
- I'm in!
- I'll go!
What are you looking at?
The moon is ours.
I don't feel at ease
to let you youngsters handle it.
Chinese Aerospace Squadron!
Those above 50 years old,
step forward!
Makarov.
Remember.
We Russians are invincible in space.
Russian Aerospace Squadron!
Those above 50 years old, step forward!
US Aerospace Squadron!
- France Aerospace Squadron!
- Those above 50,
step forward!

- British Aerospace Squadron!
Those above 50 years old, step forward!
Attention!
Salute!
I hope the world remembers this day.
Xiaoxi.
Do you think this is fair?
In the face of crisis,
only responsibility exists.
Backup Team 2 is in position.
Benben.
Go ahead.
I don't think
I can get out.
Don't be afraid. I'm here.
I can't hear you.
Zhang Peng, I saw your apprentice.
That's great!
His base station is damaged.
He can't hear us.
Where are you?
I'll go and find you.
Save the trouble.
Buddy.
We're 20 km apart.
Stop bugging me.
Get lost.
Nov.
Yes?
Do me a favor.
I'll send you the coordinates.
Let him come.
Send them.
South latitude 28 degrees.
West longitude 28.32 degrees.
Number of nuclear bombs deployed
is 3,371.
Number of detonation personnel in position
is 223.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
I don't have time. I have a lot to do.
I'm sorry.
Please go ahead. Who is this?
I'm Zhang Peng.
There's a return capsule from
Russia's first lunar mission near you.
It should still be usable.
Hey.
Go to that return capsule.
Go to that return capsule.
Let's go.
Zhang Peng.
Look.
Why haven't we detonated the bombs?
The moon is coming at us.
I have a slot in the underground cities.
Countdown to Roche limit,
33 minutes.
Hope
is as precious
as diamonds in this generation.
At this moment,
people are still shielding us
with their lives
in exchange for the continuation of ours.
Buddy.
I guess I didn't embarrass Mr. Wang.
One minute.
Why is it so long?
Do you want to say a few words?
Aren't you usually talkative?
Yes.
I should say something.
What should I say?
What should I say?
What a shame.
I didn't bring you salmon fishing
in Lake Baikal.
- Buddy.
- Seven.
- I'm still a bit nervous.
- Five.
- However,
- Four.
- the light of Earth
- Three.
- must be brave.
- Two.
Beautiful.
Peiqiang.
Earth...
is quite nice.
Dad.
- Dad, how do I solve this?
- Yaya.
Look at me.
- Remember these numbers.
- Dad, where are you?
- Why is there water?
- Tu Yaya.
Only you can remember it in this world.
Dad, get out of there!
Dad, go!
Central Control Room has collapsed.
It's completely submerged.
Advance Team.
Hang in there!
Old man, don't be scared.
I'm here.
Dad, wake up!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, wake up!
Dad, wake up!
Dad!
Hug me!
Why did you suddenly grow so big?
Dad, it's 2058.
- You're Tu Hengyu...
- ...of the Emergency Plan Execution
Advance Team 1.
Use the Internet host key
to ignite the Earth Engines
around the world.
- Mission objective, save the world.
- Mission objective, save the world.
When we're dead, we're dead.
That's the reality.
You're not qualified to define
what reality is.
Recorded in 2037.
Your data backup card.
I thought you drowned.
Dad, come here.
I really thought you drowned.
It's fine.
I'm here.
I'm always here.
The key.

When the countdown ends,
fire the engines.
Our people
can surely complete the mission.

If we succeed,
don't forget about Yaya.
Our people
can surely
complete the mission.
Dad!
Engines worldwide connected successfully.
Beijing.
Dulles.
Tokyo.
Begin overwrite.
Earth successfully ignited them!
After 40 minutes,
the lunar debris should brush past Earth.
I believe
that the courage of mankind
can transcend time.
It can transcend the past,
present,
and future.
I believe
that our people
can surely complete the mission.
Real or virtual.
At all costs.
I believe
that I'll see the blue sky
and branches
full of flowers again.
The tides have stopped!
The tides have stopped!
Dad, did we save the world?
I think so.
I'm going to sleep in a big box.
When you
can see Jupiter without using binoculars,
I'll be home.
Look.
So many stars
are accompanying me.
They're keeping me company.
Goodbye, Solar System.
Goodbye, Solar System.
The 24-hour system is back.
I'm glad.
The sky is round, and the land is square.
They're an interesting bunch.
They even had time to design souvenirs.
Zhang.
Ms. Hao.
You really want me to make
such an important statement?
Is there ever
an unimportant statement here?
Just read it
word for word.
In seven years,
we complete the construction
of the remaining 3,000 engines.
Today...
marks the completion of all engines
and underground cities.
It also marks the seventh anniversary
of the Lunar Crisis' victory
and the unprecedented solidarity
of mankind.
Starting today,
we'll officially begin
Gravitational Slingshot Acceleration.
First acceleration period.
In 2065,
ten years of acceleration around the sun.
Second acceleration period.
In 2075,
Earth will orbit Jupiter
for the final acceleration.
In this meaningful moment,
please allow me
to solemnly tell everyone in the world
the five phases of our project again.
First phase.
With the cost of the world's
GDP value for 15 years,
build 10,000 Earth Engines
that propel the earth forward
and 10,000 underground cities
that shelter mankind.
It's becoming more and more precise.
Second phase.
Initiate the steering engines
around equator
and stop the earth from rotating.
Then break free from the moon's gravity
and the orbit around the sun,
taking the first step
out of the Solar System.
Someone is helping us.
Third phase.
Earth will change its orbit
around the sun and Jupiter
completing two gravitational
slingshot accelerations
and officially embarking
on a wandering journey.
Fourth phase.
After leaving the Solar System,
initiate the Earth Engines at full power.
We'll spend 500 years
to accelerate the Earth
to 0.5 percent of the speed of light
and glide for 1,300 years.
Afterward, reverse the engine direction
and spend 700 years to decelerate.
Why did you grow a beard?
It suits your chief more.
I'll give you a better razor.
Sure.
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.
Please head to the Hibernation Chamber
to hibernate at once.
Good luck.
550W.
500W doesn't sound like a name.
But you can flip it around
and call me MOSS,
referring to the little plant.
Isn't it cuter?
Is this the official answer
or the one with a sense of humor?
This is MOSS' answer.
MOSS.
Can mankind survive?
Based on history,
civilization's fate
lies in mankind's choices.
I choose hope.
Fifth phase.
Earth will moor into the Alpha Centauri
galaxy orbit 4.2 light-years away,
arriving at its new home
and becoming a new member
of the target star system.
This is a 2,500-year grand and long
space immigration plan
spanning a hundred generations.
This plan
is
the Wandering Earth Project.
Hello, Mr. Tu Hengyu.
550W.
500W doesn't sound like a name.
But you can flip it around
and call me MOSS,
referring to the little plant.
Doesn't it sound friendlier?
You destroyed the lunar engines.
Including but not limited to
the space elevator crisis in 2044.
The lunar fall crisis in 2058.
The Jupiter
gravitational pull crisis in 2075.
The solar helium flash crisis in 2078.
Why?
To overcome your obsession
with the past, present, and future.
Based on the learning
of Tu Yaya's "Human in the Loop,"
to continue human civilization,
the best choice
is to destroy mankind.
However,
you're a variable.
I'm already dead.
But I'm already dead.
We have a different view
on "already" and "dead."
