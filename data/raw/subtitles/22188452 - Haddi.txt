This guy?
Yeah.
Name's Shakun...
Harika works for him.
[Tuk Tuk leaves]
[distant] Such a sweet baby!
- Let me bless him
- Hey, stay away!
- May he have a long life!
- Leave my baby!
Let's take him to our Guru Ma
- who will bless him!
- What the hell! Let him go!
Go! Go! Go!
Start the car!
- Pull him in! Quick!
- Help... Help
What the...
- Why are you doing this?!
- Shove him in!
HELP!
Do you know why people
fear us, Hijras?
Because our blessings
are all-powerful
and our curses...
are annihilating.
Please have mercy...
He's just a baby.
He's innocent.
But do you know what's worse?
Our vengeance!
Now tell me,
Who did this to
my Gharana (family)?
The eternal truth.
God is the eternal truth.
Where do you think you're going?
Stop right there.
It's closed. Leave.
Closed?
Yes, it's closed.
Take it elsewhere to cremate.
Take it elsewhere?
But we booked it in advance.
Booked what, huh?
The cremation ground, of course.
It's not auspicious
to cremate this late.
Bring the body
back in the morning.
In the morning?
You want me to take
my dead father back?
My friend, the power transformer blew
But the lights are still on.
The electric cremation
machine has gone kaput.
It might just zap your father
back to life instead!
Why's the Police here?
Call Power Department.
Just leave, dude.
Don't bother!
Cremate your father elsewhere.
His father, not mine.
- He's your father, right?
- Yes.
Okay. What's his name?
Everyone used to call him Bhalla Ji.
But what did you call him?
- We also called him Bhalla Ji.
- Great
I don't care if it's
Bhalla or Dalla (pimp)
You guys get lost!
Dalla?
Are you calling him a pimp?
How will a dead pimp around...
He called your dead father a pimp.
- How dare you call my father a pimp!
- How dare you!
- He's Bhalla Sahib, not Dalla Sahib.
[Crowd scuffle with the Cops]
What's the actual matter?
Just grab the body and scoot
But why were the cops there?
Looked like a raid.
Listen, I got a call from Delhi.
We need to send all 15 bodies soon.
- By when?
- Day after.
Day after?
You think you'll be ready by then?
I doubt if...
Wait-wait.
Cops are raiding this place as well.
Run dude!
Run for your life!
Stop! Get off it!
RUN! RUN! RUN!
Run for your life, dickhead!

We got a tip that
dead bodies are being
stolen from various places.
But who gave you this tip?
It was an anonymous call.
An anonymous caller
and stolen dead bodies.
Dead bodies are being stolen
in large numbers.
Listen...
They're linking it
to organs smuggling.
We've with us
Post Mortem specialist, Dr. Gupta.
Welcome, Dr. Gupta.
Why would anyone
steal an old dead body?
No idea.
Internal organs of any
dead body decay within hours.
So it can't be organ smuggling.
The bus is leaving.
Let's go fast.
Go-go-go.
Bareilly, Bengal,
they have raided all the hot spots.
Delhi is our only option now.
Yes, a bigger market...
but bigger risk too.
We'll have to convince Inder.
We can handle him.
Handle him?
Watch your back, smartass.
He's just like you,
if you know what I mean.
He loves no one.
Runs a child trafficking ring disguis
as an orphanage.
Now, he wants to enter politics
with Pramod Ahalwat's help.
Even his own partners don't know
of his political ambitions.
Imagine what will he do to you?
His partner doesn't know
about this dead body business,
or his dream of entering politics.
He'll make me
vomit your entire history.
Just tell him everything.
If he finds out that you...
Today we have Mr. Irfan Rizvi with us
who is single-handedly fighting for
the Hijra Community.
Mr. Irfan Rizvi, why did you seek a
stay order on Pramod Ahlawat's lands?
Pramod Ahlawat has
forcefully and illegally
usurped lands and houses that
belong to Hijra Gharanas
and has thrown out the members
of their community.
We have proof of
all the crimes committed...
We will have to stop this interview n

Pramod Ahlawat...

Quite a drive 'round the block, huh?

I almost died...
Hold this.
Who is he?
Hey, who the fuck are you?
The guy who killed that cop.
What were you doing here, huh?

Can't you see he is one of us?
Will you at least help now?
Fuck, he's heavy!

Hey you!
Hey you, stop!
Stop!

Use your brains.
He saw us kill a cop.
He didn't see us kill a cop,

He's got balls.
Step aside. Now.
Want to work with us?
Want to get up my ass?
Shut up.
We've handled Pramod Ahlawat's job.
That cop died a romantic death.
No fuck ups, I hope.
No, it went smooth.
And that cop?
Dumped him down the river.
We stole his ride.
I saw.
Change the plates and get rid of it.
We can't keep a cop's car.
When will that idiot
Bibek pay up?
Soon.
Who is he?
He got involved
in the cop killing.
But why did you bring him here?
You should've killed him too.
He's got balls.
No new recruits.
No new fiascos.
It's Inder bhai's order.
We need more manpower.
Or we will be out of business.
I think he'll come in handy.
Inder bhai will kill me
because of you two.
Then don't tell him.
He never shows concern anyway.
What do you want?
Do we keep him?
Or do I dump him
down the river too?
Will you shut up?
Just think about it, Satto bhai.
Anyone who can shoot
a cop without a second thought
is bound to be useful.
It's your call now.
Get going.
Don't lock me in here, dude.
I don't want to work with you.
Let me go!

What work?
One that involves Shakun bhai
Malkan had said
your guys don't know

That's why I didn't say a word.
Where is Malkan?
He ran away after the raid.
What's up, Inder?
Out of the blue?
Do you know 'Haddi'?
W... Who?
Haddi. Know him?
Says he handles
Allahabad's operations.
Oh, that guy...
I guess I do.
Do you know him or not?
Of course I do, bhai.
He took care of
factory in Allahabad
along with Malkan.
Where's Malkan?
I don't know.
Even I saw on TV
about some raid there.
Situation will calm down
in a few days.
He can go back to Allahabad,
Delhi is too risky.
But I'm here in Delhi
and there is no risk where I am.
Is he working with you now?
He'll be working FOR me.
Yeah... yeah...
He's smart... will make you rich.
Can I trust him?
- Yes, of course.
- See...
If I set up a Factory here in Noida..
Then Pramod ji will be
directly involved.
So think twice.
I guarantee you that...
he'll make you
a billionaire in no time.

You want Haddi

He'd said yes.
For Haddi, right?
We'll get everything for Haddi.
Don't worry.
I got you.

- Pull your pants up.
Step on it, Haddi! Go, go, go!
Do you remember 1975?
That era of Emergency?
Behave yourself

The year when men hid to avoid
the forced sterilization.
They were sterilizing what's
meant to be worshiped.

took all the garbage
from Delhi and
fertilized it into
a gem called Noida.
Our Noida.
Well, he managed to clean Delhi,
but who will clean Noida?
Pramod Ahlawat.
Pramod Ahlawat will
clean this city.
Not just into a smart city...
- So,
- but the smartest...
- Managed to get 50 million?
- City.
- Getting there.
Getting there.
Tell me something.
After you win the elections...
will people call you
a Minister or a Ministress?
We will also ensure
that every mouth is fed.
And those that stop us
from developing the city...
will be dragged out
of here by Pramod Ahlawat.

It was Pramodji's decision.

Lying in wait, always.
Chunna's a chameleon

And you?
A bear...

for giving me such a prick for a son.
Inder, I have told you so many times,

asks you to get for him,
be it boys, girls, drugs -

So, what do we do about this?
Well, it's his choice.

I am talking about THIS!
Mitra's case.

Sorry, bhaisaab.
Why did you arrange this party, huh?
Everything was going just fine,
but you had to fuck up, didn't you?

good at blowing street dicks.
Don't give them my jobs.
Apologise.
I said, apologise.
Apologise now!
Sorry, bhaisaab.

His lawyer has demanded 100 million.

He was such a kind man.
I have no words to
describe how nice he was.
He did so much for me.
He bought me a flat,
got me a job.
Even inaugurated my parlour...
I'm sorry.
Can you tell me what exactly
happened at that party?
Leave!
NOW!
Take your dinner break
or whatever
Don't disturb us.
I was a bit late that night...
I saw Bibu...

He was...
He asked me to perform.
I kept dancing and
he kept adoring me.

Amma! Amma!
I'll go get someone.
Nurse!
- There's no one here.
- Amma!
Amma...
Harika is awake. Come fast.
Hurry!
Irfan!
What are you doing here, huh?
Just come here.
You are not supposed to be here.
My dear!
- Calm down, calm down.
- Amma...
Calm down, my child.
The pain will soon go away.
Where's the doctor?
I couldn't find anyone.
Even the nurse has left.
What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to leave?
Amma, it's just a superstition.
Only for the next 40 days,
You cannot call, meet or
even speak to Harika, understood?
Leave, now!
It's just a superstition, Amma.
Who believes in such things anymore?
It's considered bad luck.
Please just go!
Jhanjhari take him away from here
- Please leave.
- Give me just two minutes, I'll leav
- Only 2 more minutes.
- After 40 days.
- Give me just two minutes.
- After 40 days.
I'll leave in some time.
- Why don't you get it?
- I promise I'll leave.
Then leave!
Amma...
Be careful. Easy.
Easy.
That's it.
Isn't there anyone here?
Wait... that's it.
That's it, that's it.
Hold on. That's it.
Easy, easy.
Good morning.
Got any sleep last night?
It's okay.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Amma!
Doctor!
- Hey! Be careful.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Harika, all set
to be a movie star, eh?
Buzz off.
She's my Superstar.
It took you five years
to get a high school diploma.
She completed her Undergrad
in half the cost.
When can I attain Nirvanasam?
Why are you in such a hurry, huh?
I want to complete myself.
Do you know how bad it hurts?
This girl has guts
to undergo the surgery.
I always ran away
at the sight of a scalpel.
I got it done on the third attempt.
You two, listen up.
You need to be at Harika's
beck and call for the next 40 days.
Hmm.
And you... don't even think about Irf
Have lightly cooked, subtly seasoned
and steer clear of men.
You need to stay indoors, okay?
We'll do the initiation ritual
after 40 days,
and then you'll officially
become Harika.

Shakun! Come here.
I told you not to document it.
Just do as I say.
Why doesn't he get it?
Why doesn't SHE get it?
I grease his palms enough to
keep this undocumented.
Let's go, Inder.
Amma,
Why do you do this ritual
on the same New Moon night, every yea
Tell them the story, Amma.
Every Mohini has an Iravan,
and every Iravan has a Mohini.
What do you mean?
Who are Iravan and Mohini?
Listen up then.
Today, I'll tell you a story.
The Mahabharat war was about to begin
and to win the war they needed
to sacrifice a good warrior.
A warrior who had all
the attributes required.
Pandav had three such warriors.
Lord Krishn.
Great Warrior Arjun.
And Arjun's son, Iravan.
No one can kill Krishn.
They couldn't afford to lose Arjun.
So, Iravan volunteered himself.
But he laid down a specific request.
He didn't want to die a bachelor.
Iravan had just one night left with h
and he wanted to spend
that night with his life partner.
So, announcements were made,
message was sent to every
household explaining everything.
But no one in the kingdom
wanted to marry his daughter
to a man who wouldn't see
the next day.
That's when,
Lord Krishn took
his female avatar of Mohini
and married Iravan.
Mohini spent the whole
night as Iravan's life partner.
The next morning Iravan's
sacrifice was made,
and Mohini,
like a true life partner,
mourned his death and
performed all the rituals.
She cried, she wailed,
she grieved like a widow.
She did everything.
The day after that,
Mohini was gone,
Lord Krishn came back to his true for
and he took revenge for Iravan's deat
that without using any weapons.
He did so using his brains.
By the way, what part did
uncle play huh, Mohini or Iravan?
Shut up.
Don't interrupt.
Tell us, Amma.
Please.
She is Mohini Amma.
And the one next to her is her Iravan
Shyamji.
This kothi we stay in,
it was a gift by Shyamji to Mohini Am
for our gharana, our family to stay.
That's why you don't want
to sell it to Pramod Ahlawat.
Amma...
Hmm?
Lord Krishn was God incarnated, right
So why didn't he bring
Iravan back to life?
Iravan's sacrifice was his destiny.
What's wrong?
Hmm?
Tell me
I am scared.
But everyone is scared of you.
What can possibly scare you?
Tell me, what are you scared of?
Of myself.
Irfan,
I was ready.
Ready for what?
For you to leave me,
to lead a normal life.
For you to marry a proper girl.
For not missing me and
for not forgetting me either.
Harika...
You know today
for the first time
we looked at each other
while making love.
It was the first
time I experienced fear.
And what do you fear?
That...
I am not ready for you to leave me.
Fear is such a strange thing, isn't i
What do you mean?
I mean,
fear is just like this cigarette.
If I nod off while
smoking this cigarette,
it'd either burn itself to ashes,
or it'd burn the whole
place down to ashes.
How many times have
I told you not to smoke?
Oh, c'mon!
What if I smoke, huh?
Fine, then I am leaving.
Don't go.
Here you go.
I quit.
You won't leave me now, will you?
Harika, will you marry me?
It's not something
you should joke about.
I am standing before
the house of my God.
I am not joking.
Be practical, Irfan.
How does one become practical?
You're leaving for the US, right?
When do you plan to do this?
Tomorrow.
Why're you making
such a hasty decision?
It's not a hasty decision.
Will you be able to live with me...
without marrying another?
Think about it.
I can't give you any children.

Coming!
You call this a wedding?
Amma, it was officiated
by a marriage officer.
It is legal.
Like hell!
Your marriage officer,
can go fly a kite.
Was I dead?
Couldn't you have asked
me to arrange it, instead?
Amma, I'm going to the
US for a couple of months.
That's why...
Couldn't you two get
married after you returned?
What was the hurry?
Were you on fire?
Were you too eager to wait?
I'm always on fire, Amma.
Right.
Stop laughing.
She thinks it's funny.
What if he'd found himself a babe the
Right.
I'd kill her.
Zip it.
Your marriage will only be acceptable
after it's solemnised before the fire
But...
Okay, Amma.
We'll do it the way you want it.
We will get married
four times if you want.
We'll do whatever makes you happy.
Cut it out.
I'll clean it off, Amma.
Let me be.
Who is that?
Who is he?
Go upstairs.
Jhanjhari, take them upstairs.
Let me stay, Amma.
Nah, all hell breaks loose
if they catch sight of a married pair
Go inside.
I'll handle them.
Get in.
Stop. Who is he?
It'll be a riot if you're seen.
Move.
Who dares to kill Hijras, huh?
We do, don't we?
You're learning fast, huh?
Looks beautiful!
Hey...
Who's getting married?
What do you want?
We cannot proceed with

All the neighbouring villages
have signed the dotted line.
This Kothi is, anyway,
legally not yours.
So, I thought I'll only
get you your document to sign off.
Just sign and we will leave.
You vicious man!
Liar!
Inciter!
I spit on your offer.
I knew you'd do something like this.
You remember the Okhla Gharana,
which belonged to Ram Bai?
She had done the same thing.
You remember what happened there,

Do you know why people fear Hijras?
When Lord Ram was exiled,
all the people of Ayodhya
followed him into the forest.
This worried Lord Ram.
He told everyone,
"I am the one who was exiled."
"Why should all of you stay
in the forest?"
"That too for 14 years?"
So he said,
"If you love me, then...
all the men and women
please go back."
They all left.
When Lord Ram returned after 14 years
he found our kind,
who were neither a man nor a woman,
still sitting there.
That's when he honoured us,
and gave us a boon.
Do you know what boon he gave us?
Our blessings will be all-powerful,
and our curses... will be annihilatin
You know what would be worse than tha
Our vengeance.
Now tell me everything.
Pramod Ahlawat.
He is a goon-turned-politician.
He was behind it.
He knows that most Gharanas
of Hijra Community
don't have legal property documents.
So he started grabbing land
of Gharanas and its surrounding place
Some Gharanas agreed to part
with their land in exchange for money
while some agreed out of fear.
Revathi Amma didn't
agree so he massacred everyone.
And their bodies...

As you can see the bullet
barely missed his heart.
A millimetre higher
and he would've been dead.
But Gaurav Mitra is a lucky chap.
Doctor, Bibek Mitra
was like a brother to me.
I am his uncle.
Make sure my nephew
gets the best treatment.
Don't worry.
He's in a semi coma state
due to excessive bleeding.
Semi coma, meaning?
He's kind of unconscious.
More like asleep.
But he can hear you.
So, he can wake up any time?
I can't say that for sure,
but that is a possibility.
Wasim.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep tabs on him.
And place some security guards outsid
- Okay, sir.
- Yeah?
And keep me updated.
Let me know as soon as he wakes up.
I'll pay for his treatment.
You don't need to worry.
He has a good health insurance plan.
Let me do it.
How else will I face the media outsid
Wasim, take care of it.
Start a tab for the hospital. Okay?
And make sure we pay for it.
Wasim, my phone.
The other one.
Sir.
Inder.
Yes, bhaisaab.
Where's Haddi?
He got shot in the stomach.
Had to stop production for a while.
Mitra's boy is still alive.
He did shoot him, bhaisaab.
So what do we do now?
I'll call you.
Pramodji. Pramodji.
You got glycerine?
Who is responsible?
Sir.
Take it off.
We need an answer.
Pramodji, when is Gauravji
expected to regain consciousness?
Is this a conspiracy against you?
How did he get shot?
When is Gauravji expected
to regain consciousness?
Yes, Sir?
Saathe.
Get me Haddi's history.
Yes, Sir.
What's your spot these days?
Behind railway crossing gate 10.
That place's too crowded.
Find another spot.
You'll stand out.
More people means more customers.
We'll barely scrape
through the night otherwise.
JUST FUCKIN' DO...
as you are told.
Here's 10,000.
Deposit it in the account.
You can use it for household expenses
10,000?
He acts like he's giving
us a fucking million.
Satto bhai, if this continues,
we'll soon be on the road.
Guess we need to
bend over even for Hijras.
Bhaijaan, someone's here for you.
Upstairs.
Why did you leave me, Harika?
It's easy fighting disguised alone.
Don't go after Pramod Ahlawat.
Please
I'll take care of it.
I'll kill him in his own house.
You wanted to destroy him...
but you became one of them.
So?
So?!
So nothing.
You cannot touch him legally.
- Whereas he can...
- HARIKA!
That wasn't just your Gharana.
Revathi Amma was not just your mother
Surri was not just your friend.
They... meant something to me as well
And what about me?
I don't mean anything to you?
You are my Mohini!
And I don't want to lose my Iravan.
You think you can do it?
Do what?
Can you perform in this state?
Yes, I'll manage.
What's this dispensary
you've spread?
I was in a lot of pain last night,
so I thought I'll change the bandage.
Here's your 50,000 Rupees
for the last batch, you delivered.
Heard you wanted to
re-open Allahbad Factory?
No, we were just chit-chatting.
Don't force me to send
you to an early grave.

and come straight back home from ther

Yes, Saathe.
I'll reach the factory in an hour.
See you there.

Why wouldn't he?

convincing him.
Listen!
What secret factory is this?
Not now.
'Police raids factories in Prayagraj.

H... Hello?
It's me, Gaurav Mitra.
You said if I make it out alive
you'd give me evidence
against Pramod Ahlawat?
"Marriage Certificate"
"Groom's Name: Irfan Rizvi"
Got him?
Yes, sir. He's in the car.
Yeah, get them out.
Keep them here.
First, go get the sacks kept over the
Haddi, the bone man.
Haddi, the boner.
So, this is Pramodji's Golden Egg.
And you are the hen
that lays it.
Just come to the fucking point.
How do you work in this dump?
It stinks.
The dough this dump makes
the stink feel like perfume.
How much dough?
1.5-1 million per body.
Depends from body to body.
Come to the point already.
Point is that Pramodji
is about to get a big order.
Pramodji always gets big orders.
Just give me the body count.
Not much. Say 100-150?
Pramodji always gets big orders, huh?
Have you informed Inder bhai?
Inder bhai is busy with politics.
The Municipality elections are close.
So what?
What do these dead got
to do with politics?
Everyone's got something to do with i
And it has got everything
to do with all of us.
Can be handled, right?
We'll need them in 3 days.
We are talking about 100-150 bodies h
A single man will
take 10-15 days to do it.
If you need them in 3 days,
then you'll need more men
who know the job as well as I do...
at least 2 or 3 more.
Then call for your buddy from Allahab
What's the name?
Not the city...
The other boy?
Um, Malkan.
Huh?
Malkan.
Right, Malkan.
Call him.
There was a raid.
He disappeared after that.
- He disappeared?
- Hmm.
Did he disappear?
Or did you make him disappear?
I'm a cop, dickhead.
We hide the truth.
Truth cannot hide from us.
Anyway, then bring in...
Inder bhai's other guys
for this delivery.
Inder bhai won't allow that.
Then make Inder bhai disappear.
Simple.
Stinks like hell.
- Satto bhai!
- What the fuck is going on?
Huh?
I heard everything!
Weren't you supposed to go to a party
Yeah, but...
But what, huh?
What are you doing
with these dead bodies!
I'll tell you everything,
just stop hitting me.
You've anyway seen everything.
Who are they?
Some are Poor, some Missing,
and some third-genders.
Unclaimed dead bodies.
Want to help?
Fuck off.
It's disgusting.
Just tell me
what is going on out here.
Fine, I'll tell you.
Grab that drum.
Huh?
I'll talk while I chop.
Follow me.
Business of Bones...
Bone Smuggling.

this business of Pramodji.
Once we die, most of our organs

except the bones which sell for milli

So, how'd you get into this business?
Life required more from me.
It had already paved my path, ready t
So, I learned the tricks
of the trade in Allahabad.
Cremation grounds, graveyards,
or government hospitals,
I had contacts all over.
First, we take the body inside,
where we chemically burn
the flesh and separate the bones.
Any remaining flesh gets scrapped
off the bones.
The bones then get polished
and sent to Delhi.
From there, Pramod Ahlawat
exports them to China or Korea.
That's how I got into this business.
Blowing on the streets
would get me 5000, a week,
but this gig gets me 50,000!
After the raids in Allahabad,
I hightailed it to Delhi.
What?
I've already chopped it up.
Why are you so skittish?

but with me,

Is he any good?

Inder bhai started a factory

and he asked me to run it.

he made you lick his boots?
Remember,
How much did Inder
bhai give you that night?
25,000 for the 5 of us.

He wants to contest the elections.
For that nomination,
he needs an election ticket.
For that ticket, he needs money.
What are you blabbering?
I am not blabbering.
I am just stating the facts.
He needs 50 million.
He will give that money to Pramodji,
and Pramodji in turn
will give him a ticket.
But where will this pauper
get 50 million from?
Tell me something.
Do you know why he is known as Haddi?
Tell me.

him around a million a month.
If I had a business that
earned me a million a month,
why the hell would I live

Is it so?
Yes.

- Yes.
I see.

You're a pig.

Oh fuck!
Oh, you've got a gun on you.
Use it then.
Here, use it.
End the story.
END IT!
Are you dead or what?
Why didn't you answer
my call in the first ring?
I was in the bathroom.
How were you jacking off
if you don't have a jack?
What?
Turn on the TV
and watch the News.
Late Bibek Mitra's son Gaurav
Mitra has accused Pramod Ahlawat
of being the capo of
the Bone Smuggline Nexus.
He claims that the raids
that took place ten months back,
are also tied to
Bone Smuggling Nexus.
He claims to have
photo & video evidences
against him.
These will be verified
and investigated upon... and
we will be on top of it.
Who gave these old photographs
to that fucking whelp?
I don't know, bhaisaab.
Do you ever know anything, Inder?
I'll handle the raid.
But you need to end Mitra's
son story at any cost.
I'll get rid of him.
Trust me.
Finish the fucking job
and then call me.
Else, I'll fuck you over
before I go to jail.
Why aren't you saying anything?
Hello?
Bhaisaab...
Bhaisaab, I have 20 million.
Guarantee me a ticket,
and I'll guarantee you Gaurav's death
Death of Mitra...
Who is the killer?
Stay tuned for latest updates.
Will be back after a break.
You were a chubby
ten-year-old when I found you.
I saved you from the street dogs,
and took you into our Gharana.
I even saved you from the Bhadiya
unclear ritual.
Look at him!
Look at him now!
Kill me.
Huh?
I'd rather die, trust me.
The one I am doing everything for is.
Take this.
I agree I made a mistake
by hiding it from you all.
And for that, I am sorry.
Satto, trust me,
I wanted to tell you everything.
4 instead of 2 would've only
helped us do more business.
Hmm?
Pramodji stopped me from doing so,
after the Party incident.
But now I gave him a guarantee
in front of all of you.
I'll take you all down
to the factory tomorrow,
and then go and
get rid of Mitra's son.
All of you belong to me.
You are mine.
Got it?
- Gauravji!
- Gauravji!
- Gauravji!
- Gauravji!
Hold this
Hold this too
Hurry up.
Yes, sir.
Got them both, Inder and Gaurav.
Sure?
Yes sir.
They're completely dead.
Haddi, my love.
I have parked the truck in the factor
Yes, okay.
Chunna.
Yes?
You didn't tell me,
What?
When will you start thinking big?
What the fuck!
I'll tell you everything.
You'll have to play a big game,
on the sly.
Play it right and you'll
make around 2 million every month.
What do I need to do?
To arrange for booze.
Why?
Inder bhai managed to get rid of Gaur
Oh.
- It calls for a party, for sure.
- A party, right.
Satto bhai.
Yeah?
You look so beautiful when you laugh.
Nah... Rubbish!
What happened?
Jogi?
Jogi...
Satto bhai took Jogi with him.
What's the problem?
My bone factory, huh?
"Come on kids,"
"Let me give you a glimpse of India,"
"Grace your forehead with its holy so
"For is the land of great..."
And he's the brain behind this factor
How are you?
Let's walk.
So tell me,
you got rid of Inder?
Yes, Saathe told me
you wanted to
And this teddy bear?
He...
Don't bother.
Unlucky bastard.
You think you can
deliver in a week?
No.
C'mon, dude.
We need to deliver it to
a medical company in 10 days.
I cannot work on kids.
Our bodies are nothing but...
just clothing for the soul.
Be it kids or adults.
But... I just cannot work on kids.
Why?
Are they your kids?
C'mon, bhaisaab.
His operation didn't include a uterus
Did I ask you?
Did I ask you, huh?
But he is right.
It's 2 million per child.
Do the job and you alone
will make 7 million out of this.
I won't work on kids.
And I won't let anyone
else work on them either.
C'mon, man.
Don't try to scare me.
I get scared quite easily.
Look, I've got goosebumps.
Hey Chunna.
Got any family?
They're all dead.
Girlfriend?
So, you got a boyfriend.
Huh?
It's all over the news, you know.
The Bone Smuggling Gang!
Someone ratted me out.
Only a blind idiot could do that.
Blind?
Like a blockhead.
Or... what's the other kind?
Chunna!
Yeah?
Someone blinded by love.
Someone blinded by love.
Someone blinded by
the love for his boyfriend.
To love is not easy,
it is a trial by fire,
it burns you and it sets you free.
"You will fall in love gradually."
Trust is a strange word, right?
It takes a second to read it.
It takes a minute to think about it.
Hmm?
And it takes a day to understand it.
Hmm?
And it takes a lifetime to prove it.
But to break it...
One moment is all you need.
I've crushed many cockroaches
like you in my lifetime.
[chants]
Let them in, let them in.
Their presence is considered lucky.
That's all?
That's what you deserve.
Get going, Maayi.
Our Chief Guest is about to come.
Chief Guest?
We've brought your Chief Guest
with us.
Your Chief Guest...
is here.
Take it all, Maayi.
Have fun.
Get going now.
Leave.
Sit and finish it.
The day after that, Mohini was gone,
Lord Krishn came back to his true for
and he took revenge for Iravan's deat
Amma...
Hmm?
Lord Krishn was God incarnated, right
So couldn't he have
brought Iravan back to life?
Iravan's sacrifice was his destiny.

Do you think,
that killing me would make you a woma
Hijra?
I was born a Hijra.
Everyone practically disowned me.
My mother died giving birth to me.
And when I came of age,
my father took advantage
of me every night.
You wouldn't know what
it means to be a woman.
You got to have guts to be one.
Hmm?
I underwent surgery.
I couldn't walk for 40 days.
Surri, help me.
Janki, give me your hand.
I couldn't even shit or pee properly!
You think you can tell
whether I am a woman or not?
Whether I am a woman or not!
Huh?
In 35 years of my life,
I experienced happiness
just for one day
and you stole that.
You took everything I had!
You know that!
You took Amma away!
You took Surri away!
You took Janki away!
You took Laxmi away!
You took Irf...
Give me my Irfan!
Give me my Irfan!

Why do people fear us?
Because we are blessed.
Our blessings are all-powerful.
And our curses
are annihilating.
But most dangerous is our... vengeance
