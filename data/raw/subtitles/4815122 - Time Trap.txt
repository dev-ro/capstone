Hm?
Let's go.
So what are we doing here?
Well, my grandfather
used to tell me
the future can give you
anything you want.
Come on, what do you?
What do you do?
If you wait long enough,
the future will create it.
Maybe through technology
or maybe just by making
you not want it anymore.
Either way, the answer's
in the future.
What's wrong, Boss? Come on.
You wanna go back
to obedient school?
Yeah.
I didn't think so.
What's that, Boss?
Boss!
Hello?
Hello?
Boss, let's go.
Jackie, Professor Hopper here.
Hey, you didn't get
shot by any hunters.
Awesome.
So, I found the van.
No sign of the hippies.
Uh, listen, I need you to
climbing pack together for me.
Oh, really?
But you can't tell Taylor.
If he finds out I'm doing
an expedition without him,
he'll get upset.
It's better this way.
Do you want her to have
like 10,000 of your babies?
It's like you're 13.
Just shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth.
Tay-tay.
Best friend.
Buddy.
Pal.
Oh, hi, Jackie.
And... Taylor.
Did he really say
not to tell me?
Mhm-mhm.
Hey, the whole point of
the favor was discretion.
Come on, Boss, come on.
Come here, Boss.
Sorry.
I had a teeny-tiny car issue,
so Taylor had to drive.
Besides, he wanted to help.
So you saw it?
You saw the van?
When do we go?
I appreciate you setting this up
on such short notice.
No problemo.
I appreciate your offer.
Taylor did all the hard work.
Situation's changed.
I'm going alone.
- All right.
- Who's gonna watch your back?
Boss, of course.
I'm serious.
Nobody's been on this
land in decades.
You guys don't have
anything to worry about.
It's gonna be fine.
Perfect. Then we'll be
back in no time, right?
I'm going alone.
You guys will be fine without
me for a couple o' days, okay?
If you're worried about your
evaluations, which you should be,
they've already been submitted.
And they're glowing,
if you can believe that.
Even yours.
Oh, look... twinsies.
'Kay, great. Thanks.
Gotta get up early.
You really think
you're gonna find 'em?
Maybe.
If I really get lucky, I might just
find what they went looking for.
Come on, Boss.
It's not Plan A. It's just in case.
God, you're such a worrywart.
You're just gonna hold
down the fort, huh?
Great.
You're still there, huh?
Moisture.
It's a wall.
Jackie, come on, wake up.
Come on, Jackie.
Uh, hi, good morning.
We still have to go.
Even if we have to get a ride to
the gate and hike for a few days.
No. We are not hiking
for a few days.
There's no signal within
like 100 miles of that place.
How would anybody know
when to pick us up?
You've gotta know somebody
who'd let us borrow their truck.
Somebody? Anybody?
- What are you doing with my phone?
- Nope.
I'm not calling her.
Name one other person
who has an off-road vehicle
who would bend over
backwards for you
at 6 a.m. on a Saturday morning.
And it's not her vehicle,
it's her dad's jeep,
and there's no way that
she's gonna loan it out to us.
We'll just rent a truck, it's fine.
- No, we don't have enough time.
- No!
- Cara?
- Hang up the phon...
Hey, this is Jackie. Taylor's friend
from the Archaeology program.
Say goodbye.
I am great. Thank
you for asking.
Look, Taylor has something
he wants to ask you about.
Sorry. Did I wake you up?
You're doing what?
What if I had another
option for you
that was a little
more adventurous
that would definitely
give Veeves an A?
The only thing is, you
really need to bring by
your dad's sweet-ass 4X4.
Awesome.
Text you Jackie's address
and come by like ASAP
and we'll explain on the way.
Veeves?
Mm-hmm. Cara's half-sister.
Actually, how are you with kids?
Uh... awesome.
Okay, so I'm gonna leave
this disclaimer here
just in case I get a bad grade.
Cara's hijacking my school project
to help out a guy she likes.
But there's a catch.
Dad just made her take
a refresher course
on how to drive stick.
Let's see how that went.
Okay, Dad, I got it,
I got it. I got it.
Honey, treat a
manual transmission
like you would a relationship.
You gotta give a little
to get a little.
Find the balance.
- Dad.
- What?
He's just a friend, okay?
And I really don't need your
relationship advice, but thank you.
But he was a four sport
Letterman in high school.
He plays rugby.
Do you want me to
give him your number?
'Cause it sounds like
you like him.
Now, would I let you borrow the
jeep if I didn't like the guy?
Our purpose in recording
this is to show
problem-solving through adverse
and unfamiliar situations.
So, what is our adverse
and unfamiliar situation?
Well, Jackie and I were
teaching assistants
for this really great guy in this
semester named Professor Hopper.
And uh, he's been obsessed
with finding these hippies
that went missing
back in the '70s.
Mm-hmm.
They were tripping
shrooms or something
and they went off looking
for the Fountain of Youth.
- What?
- And they never came home.
The Fountain of Youth?
Really?
Look, I'm not asking you guys
to get your hands on it.
You can stay in the car
when we get there, okay?
Yeah, alright, well,
when you told me
that you got a plan
to get Veeves an A,
you really should've elaborated.
Wait, we forgot about Furby.
- Ungh...
- Furby?
Is it imperative that he come?
I don't... he just...
he smells weird
and he always has that cheese
puff crust on his fingernails.
Well, if he's away from
his mother too long,
he gets what we call
anxiety-rrhea!
- Mom!
- But he has pills for that.
Do you have the house phone?
I won't be here, but
you know, just in case.
Great! Um, we'll have
him home by tonight.
- No booze?
- No ma'am.
- No drugs?
- No ma'am.
No girls? Absolutely no girls.
I know he's at that age because
I walked in on him the other day
- Oh!
- In his room without knocking
and you can imagine
what he was doing.
Let's go, let's get in it.
Let's get out of here and...
Perfect.
I love you, Wallace!
Okay, love you, Mom.
You can clip the cameras to your
backs to keep it hands-free.
Here you go, I'm WiFi-ready.
- The password is 'fartparty'
- What?
And one for you, my love.
Mnh-mnh, gotta earn it.
Ow.
All right, so who wants to
give Furby the rundown?
I don't need an explanation.
This is what I think
my love is for you.
Come on, man.
Thank you, fartparty.
We are going to find
the Fountain of Youth.
Well, whatever my baby wants.
Just as long as I can show you the
Fountain of Furby afterwards.
- Eww.
- So gross, dude!
Well, look at that.
It would've been impossible
to find without a satellite map.
Hey, Furby, you wanna narrate?
The state of decomposition seen
here on the van is evident that...
- Oh, yeah, no, never mind.
- Hey!
Come on, this is gold over here.
This is definitely it. Wow.
Hey, Jackie,
I brought my projector
if you wanna come up in there
and watch movies later.
Ew, no, creepy.
Jackie...
- The Hoppers?
- Yeah.
Why didn't he tell us?
I don't get it.
It means that Hopper didn't just
go looking for some random hippies
that got lost trying to find
the Fountain of Youth.
He's trying to find
his missing parents.
Guys, we should totally
take a picture for my blog.
Help me out, come on, come on.
It'll be the greatest
profile picture ever.
Alrighty.
Okay.
Everybody say... Team Hopper.
- Team Hopper!
- Team Hopper!
Everybody say... Team Furby!
Team Furby.
You guys suck.
Furby, come around and
pull this back door open.
Yes, my queen.
Sorry.
Please don't tell my mom I fell.
Are you okay? What happened?
- I tripped...
- You okay?
On this.
What?
Just wait, okay,
it might be a booby trap.
Relax, it's not The Goonies.
What's The Goonies?
Seriously?
You haven't seen The Goonies?
You kinda do look like Chunk.
What is that?
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner.
- Whoa, is that a cave?
- Easy, kid.
We're just here to document.
Wow!
This is huge.
- Firsties.
- No, Veeves.
- Please stay next to me.
- Mm-hmm.
No one said anything
about caves.
Caves have bats and...
and bears, and...
monsters...
and...
Huh! Spiders!
- Hey.
- They're everywhere! Let me go!
They're crickets.
Furby, take a chill pill, dude.
- Hey, be nice.
- Don't hurt yourself.
Crickets... spiders...
Whatever. They tried to eat me.
Where's Jackie?
I'm over here.
The rope keeps going.
I'm gonna crawl further.
Dude, it goes over a cliff.
Don't go too far.
You complete me.
Wait.
It's been severed at the top.
- Hey, clear the rope.
- Go ahead.
Guys, this room is massive.
We've got our work
cut out for us.
It looks like somebody went down
but they didn't come back up.
Someone cut Hopper's rope?
There's no way this is Hopper's
rope. It's way too old.
How far down does it go?
Um, like...
I can't tell, it's too deep
to see the bottom.
Are there any crickets?
Some, yeah.
I'm out.
Professor Hopper?
You down there?
So, we should probably do
a second line on the descent
to play it safe.
What does that mean?
All right, studmuffin, you're up
here on look-out till we get back.
So, how long we talkin'?
Um, depends how long
it takes care of the half foot.
Veeves.
Uh, not to overstep
my bounds, but uh...
your girlfriend could be
really annoying sometimes.
Cara's not my girlfriend, dude.
Uh, she's not?
No. Sometimes, I don't
even think she's a girl.
Oh, she's totally a girl.
Furby, how 'bout
you just shut up?
- She has all the fun parts.
- Furby, shut up.
All right.
Take this, just in case.
Yeah, or we can yell.
It's 20 feet away.
We don't know how far
that thing leads.
And yet you still go.
Yeah.
There's trail mix and water in my
duffel, if we're gone too long.
Later, Furb.
I'll miss you.
Counting on you, stud.
Counting on me for what?
Uh, I don't know, dude, it just
sounded nicer than "Don't
screw anything up".
We'll radio you at the bottom.
So, what is it?
One chime for yes,
two chimes for no,
and three chimes for
"I love you"?
Uh...
We really got to focus here.
I woulda killed to do this
stuff when I was her age.
I'm 13. I've been rappelling
before, so chill.
Yes, but did you have
a safety instructor
input holes and home pits and
safety cables in case you fell?
Actually, I didn't.
And that's what
made it so much fun.
Hey, Jackie, wait up.
Relax, it's gonna be fine.
Jackie knows what she's doing.
Let Veeves have
some fun for once.
Or if you want,
I've got another harness.
You could come with us.
You owe me big.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
- Hey, be careful.
- I got it.
Veeves!
Veeves!
It's fine.
They would've yelled out
if there was a problem.
- Do you think?
- Yeah.
She's just being a little sister
because you're being a big sister.
Veeves, come on!
Veeves!
Vee-eeves!
Hey, shut it, punk.
- Taylor. Taylor.
- You're fine. You're fine.
We're halfway down.
God, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.
It's crazy.
- It's like damp.
- What?
That's weird.
You can feel it.
There's like this
invisible boundary
where the air
completely changes.
What the hell?
Boss?
Boss!
Oh, shit.
Boss, someone's here.
We gotta go.
Boss! Come on.
Get in the car, boy!
What the hell?
Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Hello?
I'm unarmed.
Please don't shoot me.
I'm from the University
Archaeology Department.
I came to explore your cave.
My battery's died.
Seem to have lost my dog.
Gonna check your truck
for jumper cables.
I'm not here to steal anything.
Maybe your car battery.
Jackie?
Jackie!
Shit.
Jackie!
Taylor!
You guys in here?
Hello?
I don't remember eating
breakfast this morning.
I think I'm having
some kind of an episode.
Hello?
Oh, wow.
I think I see the bottom.
Look who changed her mind.
- Meet me on the landing.
- You look like a pro.
Glad you can join us.
We were getting lonely.
Yeah, well, how 'bout you
answer me when I call?
Uh, I didn't anything and I don't
think Jackie heard anything.
Yeah, well, then check you ears.
I've been yelling for ten minutes.
You're so weird, dude.
They're kinda boring.
Let's go explore.
Let's do it.
Adventure time.
It's so pretty.
I know, right?
Guys, we're gonna go
check out this tunnel.
Hey, Veeves, stay close,
come on.
Stay close, Cara.
Veeves, don't.
- Stop.
- What?
It's not me.
Okay, careful, watch your step.
I wonder how far back that goes.
I wonder.
It's crazy in there.
Did you hear that?
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!
Guys, what was that?
You guys, we gotta get out now.
No. We didn't come this
far just to leave now
because of some weird noises.
Taylor, seriously?
Yeah, I'm staying.
Weird noises?
Those are screams.
Let's go.
Wait.
I'm not leaving without Hopper.
Cara, wait, I'm the
fastest climber.
Furby and I can pull
you two up faster
than you could ever
pull yourselves up.
Okay? I'll come back down
once they're up.
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- All right.
Veeves!
Jackie!
Get up. What happened Jackie?
I got it.
Awesome!
It's okay, I got it.
What? He cut the rope?
- Oh!
- Shit!
Furby, I swear to God, man.
He cut it?
Furby wouldn't cut it.
Furby! Stop messin' around, man.
I swear to God.
Drop us the rope
back down, dumbass.
You almost killed Jackie.
Furby?
Why would he do that?
Hey, dude. Are you
okay up there?
Shit.
Okay, let me just take it off.
I've known Furby since
kindergarten. He wouldn't do this.
What is it?
Got caught on Cara's
harness when she fell.
How bad is it?
They feel broken.
Sorry, Hopper.
Looks like your two best
climbers just got benched.
Is yours that bad?
Yeah.
You guys, we have to
figure out an exit plan.
Our exit plan is for Furby
to stop being a dick
and throw down another rope.
Yeah, but could you
climb it with that hand?
I don't have a choice now, do I?
Cara, you're gonna have
to climb freehand.
What?
No. It's like 90 feet.
If she falls, she's dead.
Um...
Give me that radio.
I'm gonna get an A for sure.
Furby, stop messin'
around, man, okay?
We got somethin' down here
and I need you to throw down
the other end of the rope right now.
Furby?
Hit the chime button.
There's something down there.
And they have a radio.
Professor Hopper?
This is Taylor. We're here
to get you outta here.
Help me.
Cara.
Taylor.
Who is this?
Taylor, help me.
Professor Hopper?
Is that you?
Furby.
What? Did he just say Furby?
That doesn't sound like Furby.
Who is this?
Who's on this channel?
Dude, it's Furby.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm gonna figure out
what the hell's goin' on.
No, you can't go in there alone.
Let's go.
No! No! You can't go alone.
And you're staying
here with Jackie.
The one person who doesn't stand
a chance to defend herself?
I'll take my chances
with you guys, thanks.
Are you kidding me?
No.
If it were Hopper,
he would've said so.
So sit your butt
down, right now.
Who's gonna stop me?
You see?
You see now why I didn't want
to bring a 13-year-old
into this cave?
Well, it would've
been no problem
except for her stupid
friend cut the rope.
He didn't cut the rope.
I think the class project's over.
This is the kind of thing
only a camera can prove
actually happened
and you don't want
to have a record of it?
If she's shining the light,
she might as well be rolling.
Well, we can sit here
and wait forever
or we can do what
we came down here to do
and figure out
what's over there.
I hate all of you.
Bye, guys. I'll be here.
I feel like I got
put in a time-out.
Just go wait
by yourself, Jackie.
Yeah, go ahead,
stand in the corner.
Blair Witch will see you now.
I don't hear it
chiming back anymore.
Do you think maybe
they just turned it off?
Let's hope so.
Watch your head.
Professor Hopper?
God, this cave's
gotta be really old.
Professor Hopper?
Look at the formations.
Oh, so you're a cave expert now?
I watch the
Discovery Channel with Dad.
There's light ahead.
Guys?
Furby?
Why's the light
moving like that?
I don't know.
Never seen anything like it.
That's so weird.
Look, the tunnel keeps going.
Look, it's probably just Furby
screwing around with his
flashlight or something.
Hey, Furby!
Hey, give me a boost.
Got it?
Yeah, I'm good.
There's a rope.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Taylor, take
Veeves to the other room.
Why?
Just take her to the other room!
What's wrong?
Damn it, Taylor, take her
to the other room!
Yeah.
Come on.
What's she freaking out about?
I don't know.
She's your sister, so we're
gonna listen to her.
What is that?
Shh, quiet.
Hey, guys, what's up?
What are you doing?
Oh, not much, just...
can't walk, and you guys...
definitely left me
in that scary room
for what felt like forever.
But uh, you know,
enough about me.
How you doin'?
How's your day been?
There you go.
Taylor!
That room is creepy.
Right here, hang on.
- What did you see up there?
- Go! Sit!
I'm not your dog, dude.
Take it easy, Cara.
We're all dealing
with the same thing.
Take off your camera.
What's going on?
Whatever it is, it'll be okay.
Oh, my God. Cara.
Enough with the
suspense, guys. What is it?
Stay over there!
- Just leave him here.
- Leave who?
Jackie, don't let her
come over here.
Is it Hopper?
Don't move, okay?
I mean it.
No.
- Wait, oh, my God, Cara!
- Stop.
Veeves, no!
Is that Furby?
Hey, no, no, no!
Is he okay?
Is he gonna be all right?
Is he gonna be all right?!
I think his neck is broken.
How did this happen?
I don't know, but
we're gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I think he tried to climb down
and somebody cut his rope.
Who would do this to us?
Who would cut Furby's rope?
He didn't even want to
come down in the first place.
Why would he descend alone?
Oh, wow. The camera's still on.
Is there anything Furby
didn't bring in that backpack?
Grappling hook
would've been nice.
Team Hopper!
Okay, this is it.
I'm counting on you, stud.
Counting on me for what?
I don't know, dude.
It just sounded nicer than
'Don't screw anything up'.
We'll radio you at the bottom.
So, what is it?
Like, one chime for yes,
two chimes for no,
and three chimes for
'I love you'?
Not sure if the Rescue Rangers
are playing a joke on me.
But it's been radio silence
for like half an hour.
Crikey, we better head over
and check it out.
Hello?
Hey, guys, what's the deal?
I'm trying not to think
about it too much
'cause I'm not really
wired that way.
But it's kinda strange,
you know?
And by strange, I mean scary.
And by scary, I mean
I wish I hadn't started
thinking about it.
And now that I've been
thinking about it too much,
I kinda hate myself.
And now I have to poop.
So, I was trying to find
a place to do a twosie,
and uh, look what I found.
A cave, a rope, and a jeep.
Do you guys think this is
where Hopper went down?
Because I do.
Good work, Sherlocks.
You went down the wrong hole.
So I found Hopper's
dad's journal
and it looks like he had a little
too much herbal fun in the '60s,
if you know what I mean,
and got obsessed with a bunch
of Fountain of Youth mythology.
Just a bunch of drawings and stories
about Spanish conquistadors
trying to find some cave
that the natives said
contained magical healing
waters or something.
It says, the queen sent a dozen
expeditions to find this water
and bring a vial of it
to her dying husband.
All but one of the expeditions either
died at the hands of the natives
or returned empty-handed.
The last expedition disappeared
somewhere northwest of the Alamo.
That sounds familiar.
And that's the last thing
I wanna read before it gets dark.
Guys, why is it sunset?
There's no way it's that dark.
It's 1:00.
He must have a filter on the
camera. It's some kind of joke.
It's gotta be a joke.
How is it a joke? It's dark and
that's your dad's jeep, so I don't...
Guys, if Furby's dead,
he's probably not joking.
It's midnight now
and you guys aren't back.
My cell has no signal
and it's dead.
I have no idea
how to drive this thing
so Cara, when you see this,
have fun dealing with
the wrath that is my mother.
Okay, so I'm not gonna lie,
I got a little freaked out
by the coyotes
so I turned the projector off
and read a little more
of Hopper's dad's
journal instead.
So this magic water
healing story
has been passed down
through his family.
But it wasn't after Hopper's
dad had kids of his own.
And his daughter got sick
until he went
looking for the cave.
Which means that this chick
is the reason my
friends are missing.
And coyotes are gonna
eat me tonight.
Oh, hello.
My mom probably
had a heart attack
'cause I didn't come
home last night.
And you know what sucks?
It just occurred to me
that no one knows we're here
because we told them we're
going to Hamilton's pool.
What's happening?
This is a total mindfuck.
Splitting up and
going into a cave.
So not only am I
all alone up here
but I have no idea
how to get back,
no way to get back,
and no one's looking for me.
Uh, huh.
It's Tuesday now.
The jeep is dead
because I listened to the
radio all night because
I might or might not be
afraid of the dark.
I ate all of the food
I could find
and drank all the water.
And at this point, I've decided
that my friends
are probably dead.
And the only way
I'm gonna survive this
is if I climb down
with Hopper's rope
and look for his car keys.
All right, this part's
for my mom.
I'm really sorry I didn't call
you to tell you where I went.
I was just really excited
to make some new friends.
And...
I think they really
like me this time.
And if for some reason
you guys find this,
I really hope you make it home.
Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.
All right, let's party.
Here we go.
Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.
Like a real man.
Cool...
calm...
and collect...
What the heck is that?
What is it?
- Whoa.
- He sees something.
Oh, my God.
Veeves, turn it off.
So you got your answer.
Are you satisfied?
Or do you wanna keep going
until we're all dead?
It doesn't make sense.
The time code spans several days,
we've only been in here an hour.
Well, maybe we fell asleep
on the way down
or something, I...
All of us? Are you
kidding right now?
I never fell asleep.
Did you fall asleep?
Did you fall asleep?
Nobody fell asleep!
Jackie, calm down.
Well, what do you
want me to say?
Don't you think if I had an answer,
I would share it with you?
You might not have an answer,
but you're the only one with an
option that the rest of us don't have.
Yeah. What option is that?
You're the only one who has a
chance of climbing out of here.
- Maybe I can do it.
- No.
It's Veeves or it's you.
Or we go deeper into the cave,
we cross our fingers
and we hope...
No, no. It's way too dangerous.
You saw what happened to Furby.
Well, it's way more dangerous
if we stay down here.
There's somebody up there
cutting the ropes.
Yeah, well, I don't have
a rope for them to cut,
so what does it matter?
Look, none of this
was supposed to happen.
You went looking for someone
who went missing
while he was looking for
someone else that went missing.
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
I thought that
we were a step ahead
because we found the rope
leading off of the van.
Okay? I'm sorry.
You're gonna be okay here
with Taylor and Jackie for a while.
Why?
Jackie's right.
I'm the only one
who can get us out.
Still rolling.
You never know.
Can I count on you?
Hey.
Hey.
Just hold on.
Here.
Take this with you.
It's a GPS beacon.
It'll send out an SOS
from anywhere in the world.
It'll work once you
get to the surface.
I packed it once I realized
how stupid it might be
going looking for
somebody who went missing
while he was looking for
somebody that went missing.
Okay.
Don't come down
without help, okay?
Why do I get the feeling
you know what's going on here?
I don't.
Don't wanna tell me?
Fine. I mean, I'd like to know
what I'm climbing up to.
I think you owe me at least
that much, don't you?
I think it's the sun.
I think it's days and nights.
That's why the time code
didn't match the videos.
Seriously?
That might be the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.
It was just an idea.
Please don't fall.
I'll be right here
if you need me.
Remember, alert the beacon first,
then drop the rope.
I know, I know.
Alert the beacon.
Drop the rope.
Don't look down.
It should beep twice when
it picks up a satellite.
How you doin'?
Almost there.
I can feel the air
changing again.
Okay.
Taylor!
Taylor, the rope is gone.
There's something wrong
with the air.
Taylor!
Okay.
Damn it. I'm gonna get a signal.
Come on.
Shit.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Seriously?
Come on.
Come on!
Okay.
Taylor!
Taylor!
You won't believe what happened.
What do you mean,
"What happened"?
I've never seen anything like it.
Everything's gone, okay?
There's no trees,
there's no grass.
There's just rock everywhere
in these formations.
Wait, what about the GPS?
I tried to activate the beacon,
but I couldn't get a signal.
It worked before we left.
I checked it in the jeep.
Well, I walked
all over the place
and I couldn't activate
the stupid thing.
- Hello?
- Come on, I got you.
A little help?
I think a bomb went off.
When-When we came down.
There's something in the sky.
There's a whole lot to tell you.
I'll tell you when I get down.
That's an idea.
What about you?
Be careful, you're almost down.
Cara, come on, dude.
Come on what?
You were gone
for like two seconds.
If you don't want to climb
all the way up, just say so.
I don't get it.
This is not really
a good time for jokes.
I'm not joking.
Just watch the stupid playback.
Just watch it.
Okay.
How we doin'?
Almost there.
I can feel the air
changing again.
Taylor!
Taylor, the rope is gone.
There's something wrong
with the air.
Taylor!
Okay.
Shit.
What?
You say something.
Gonna get a signal.
Veeves.
Play mine.
This isn't possible.
How is this possible?
Watch that.
How we doin'?
Almost there.
- Taylor!
- What?
You won't believe what happened.
What do you mean,
"What happened"?
Believe me now?
Everything's gone...
It's just, I was up there
for 30 minutes.
This is seconds.
Why are the tapes different?
Why are the tapes different?
What the hell's
going on, Taylor?
I realized something
when watched Furby's tape.
A night had passed
in his footage.
But the rope was still running
from the cave to the van.
It wasn't a person
who cut the rope.
It was friction
over a long period of time.
What?
Time is passing
differently down here
than it is on the surface.
What?
It's the sun.
Rising and setting.
It's the only way that Furby tape
was days ahead of ours
even though we all came in
at the same time.
What?
How long have we
been down here for?
I have a date this weekend.
Seriously?
We've been in here weeks,
maybe months already.
I'm sorry, Veeves. I shouldn't
have brought you here.
Why am I the one crying?
You're 13!
I'm not crying because
you're my big sister.
And I know you'll
get us out of here.
Whoa.
So every time that happens,
that's a day?
Wait. The Fountain of Youth.
So it's like if time stops...
you stay young forever.
Guys, this really is
The Fountain of Youth.
Nothin'?
Okay.
We have to get outta here.
We've gotta have enough rope
between what we got here
and what we got in the other
room to get outta here.
For what? You want me to climb
back up there with all that rope?
I'm running out of ideas here.
Take some time to rest.
Just give me like ten minutes.
Ten minutes?
We don't have ten minutes.
It's gonna take Taylor and I
at least half an hour
to climb out of here.
How long is half
an hour down here?
Cara, you found Furby
facing down, right?
Yeah. Why?
In the video,
he was on his side.
And his radio wasn't smashed.
So, what smashed his radio?
Whoa. What the heck is that?
Okay, this is it.
Furby, stop messin' around,
man, I swear to God.
Drop us the rope
back down, dumbass.
You almost killed Jackie.
Furby?
Wait. Furby was still alive?
Hey, dude, are you
okay up there?
So it really was him
on the radio.
Furby, stop messin' around,
man, okay?
We got somethin' down here
and I need you to throw down
the other end of the rope right now.
Furby?
Professor Hopper?
This is Taylor, we're
gonna get you outta here.
Help me.
Who is this?
Taylor, help me.
Professor Hopper, is that you?
Furby.
Who is this?
Who's on this channel?
Dude, it's Furby.
No! No, no, no!
What just happened?
There's someone in here
and it's not Hopper.
I'm gonna be sick.
Don't worry about me,
just watch the tunnel.
And Veeves,
watch for falling rocks.
She's gonna be fine.
But no matter what,
you can't look up, okay?
Thanks. I get it.
You got it, Cara!
You got this. Just take it
a little bit at a time.
Oh, my God.
Sorry. I'll shut up.
Okay. Okay.
Veeves, this is exactly what
we're trying to avoid right now.
- It's Furby's footage.
- Don't watch that.
- I noticed something earlier.
- What?
He sees something here, wait...
You can slow the playback.
Do you see that?
That right there.
The sun's path keeps changing.
What? Why is it doing that?
Oh, my God.
- It's not just the sun.
- What?
It's the seasons.
This thing is the sun
shifting on the horizon.
Oh, my God, you're right.
That's not just one revolution.
It's hundreds.
Wait, what is she saying?
That's why everything was
so different on the surface.
We've been down here
a really long time.
What?
Guys, what's going on down there?
What's on the video?
This-This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Guys, what's on the video?
Those are entire years.
It's the solstice. That's the
only thing that makes sense.
Seriously? Each of those
is a year, not a day?
How long is that?
Taylor, we've been
in here for hours.
So... Holy shit.
Whoa! Oh, my God!
Cara, look out!
- Whoa!
- Jackie!
Are you okay?
Come on.
The hell is that?
Cara, be careful!
We're being rescued.
Hey, Cara, climb up it!
This thing is huge.
Dude.
Wait, there's something
coming down!
What is that?
That is a giant.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Veeves, stay back!
Come on, let's go!
Oh, my God.
I don't wanna go back up.
Dude, look!
Where did he come from?
Okay, okay, okay.
Go!
Where does it go?
- Okay, yeah.
- Veeves, got it.
We can stay ahead of him.
His suit looks hard to move.
On your leg, okay?
Guys, it hurts.
I can't do this.
I have to stop.
What's this place?
I think we lost him.
He's moving very slow.
Wait, no, no! Go, go, go!
Okay, go!
Go! Go!
Faster. Must go faster.
I think I see light up ahead.
Wait. It's fire.
Why is there fire?
Guys, there's someone
else in here.
- Veeves, take Jackie.
- Okay.
Come on, I got you.
There's no pulse but she's warm.
She just died?
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- This is Hopper's mom.
- What?
She's been here for 40 years.
I think we lost him.
Taylor, look.
From the photos.
Oh, that's Hopper's dad.
Who are those guys?
And what are they
doing with a gun?
Oh, shit.
Go. Go now.
Come on, hurry. Go.
Go! Hurry, hurry.
Shh.
Oh, my God.
Guys, what about Taylor?
You stay here.
You don't move from Jackie.
- Do you promise me?
- Okay.
Be careful.
Come here.
It'll be okay.
Taylor. Taylor!
You can't.
You can't leave me here!
Oh, my God.
You've gotta wake up.
Please wake up!
Wake up.
You gotta wake up.
You gotta wake up.
Please.
No.
No! No!
Don't touch him.
No!
No. No. No. No!
What are you doing?
Stop! You'll kill him!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
We have to get
Veeves and Jackie.
No, wait!
There's another one.
Stay back.
We gotta help him.
What's wrong with him?
We have to help him!
Cara!
Stay back.
He needs his mask to breathe.
What's wrong with him?
Oh, no.
He's out of time.
Veeves!
They're okay! Let's go.
What's he doing?
Did they just fall asleep?
Cara!
Veeves!
- Oh, my God.
- You're okay.
Uh, are these guys sleeping?
How did you manage that?
We didn't do it.
He did.
What year are you from?
Tell us what year you're from.
What happened to him?
He can't breathe our air.
We've reached the two-week
mark in the search
- Holy cow.
- for five missing students.
The three college and two
middle school students
disappeared 14 days ago
and are thought
to have been west
in a green Land Rover Defender.
Please, just tell us
what year you're from.
Joining us tonight is the
father of two of the missing,
Cara and Veeves Pintauro.
Thank you for speaking
with us tonight, Rich.
We appreciate it.
Yeah, Carter, I'm asking for
help from the public tonight.
It's been two weeks since
I've seen my daughters.
So I'm asking anybody.
Please look at these pictures.
And-And if you've seen them,
contact your local authorities.
I need my girls back.
Please.
I don't know what you're saying.
What is he saying?
I don't know what you're saying.
We must continue
to go into space
for the future of humanity.
I don't think we will survive
another thousand years
without escaping beyond
our fragile planet.
If we want a leap
into the future,
we want major breakthroughs.
American footprints
on distant worlds
are not too big a dream.
They're calling it The Ark.
15 miles long and
two miles across.
The ship may hold up to
250,000 people.
Once in orbit,
it will put to use
the world's first
Hyper Accelerator
capable of sending ships
as far as Mars
in a matter of hours.
As we take the... final steps
toward the colonization
of our new home planet...
and hope that one day,
we may return to planet Earth.
That happened
while we were down here?
This really real?
We've been in here that long?
It was like thousands
of years went by.
Long enough for people
to be 8-feet tall
and speak a different language.
So then we're
just stuck in here?
Forever?
Even if we can
get to the surface,
everything we've known is gone.
That can't be right.
What about everybody back home?
What about Mom and Dad?
Hey.
We still have each other.
And Jackie and Taylor
are here with us.
We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.
What are we gonna do?
Okay, we have two options.
We either get out
of here right now,
or we accept that we are
staying in here forever.
Because if that guys is what
humans have evolved to, then
what are we gonna
be dealing with
by the time we get
to the surface?
No matter what's up there,
we have a way out now
and we should use it.
Taylor...
Look.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
Hopper was here.
He must've gone down
another tunnel.
Taylor, we have to go.
I know what I said.
If we don't find him, this
would've all been for nothing.
What?
Hopper's the only one who's
gonna know what to do right now.
Oh, my God.
Seriously?
Wait a minute.
What about the cowboy's gun?
Thanks, Jackie.
There's four shots left.
You guys get Furby.
I'll be right back.
If you hear gunshots, don't
wait for me, okay? Just go.
Hopper?
Hopper?
Professor Hopper.
Professor, it's Taylor.
She's stuck.
- What?
- Too late.
She's my sister.
She's trapped.
Everything slows down in there.
Just like everything slowed down
as soon as you walked inside.
That's it.
You actually found it.
This whole cave's a system
designed to protect The Fountain.
Each layer's a different
speed than the last.
Taylor! We need your
help with Furby!
Jackie?
Jackie! Down here!
Stop. Don't go in there.
Go in there, I'm not gonna
be able to get you out.
Taylor!
Come on, Hopper.
We gotta go.
- Come on!
- Wait, wait, I can't move.
Come on!
I can't.
It's bad.
They stabbed me
straight through.
The water's only a few
hundred feet. Let's go.
Come on.
Stop.
I'm done.
Can't you see I'm done?
Well, maybe I'm not.
I'll bring the water to you.
I'm gonna be dead in five minutes.
Just go.
Just go.
It'll take me forever
to walk back
even with your help.
Get out now before
there's more of 'em.
I'll take that, though.
Buy you some time.
- Taylor?
- Just get outta here.
Go.
Taylor, we need your
help with Furby.
I didn't come this far
to leave without you.
I got what I came for, Taylor.
Just go!
I'll be right back.
Taylor!
He's not that far away.
I can probably get there
and back in a few minutes.
Even if I have to carry him.
Uh, well, this time,
I'm going with you.
How long is this
supposed to take?
My ankle just took seconds.
All right. Hopefully Furby
won't take that long either.
Yeah, that's unlikely.
Veeves!
I think we're good.
Get ready to light it
no matter what.
Should we try to put the
space guy in, or...?
I mean, he did us
a favor, right?
Uh, guys...
Oh, shit.
They're coming.
We have to go now.
Veeves, light it! Let's go!
Taylor, they're
waking up! Run!
Taylor, grab the
lightsaber thing.
All right, hurry. Go!
Guys, go faster, come on.
Come on, let's go!
Hurry, they're right behind us.
Holy shit, the lights
stopped moving.
How does it work?
Hurry, go.
They're coming.
Go. I'm right behind you.
Guys, come on, go!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
They're here.
Oh, my God, Oh, my God,
Oh, my God!
Hurry.
- Veeves, how you doing?
- I got this.
- Jackie?
- Killin' it.
Faster!
Guys...
Something's really,
really wrong here.
Something's really, really
wrong down here, too.
What is that? Is that water?
Between water and
psycho-Flintstones,
I say keep climbing.
Cara, be careful!
Cara!
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God!
Hold on tight!
Oh, my God, it has my arm!
Cara!
I got you.
Guys...
No! Don't!
Cara!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Whoa, Jackie, are you okay?
Oh, no, no no.
Taylor, they're climbing.
Guys!
Look!
Holy shit.
- Cara?
- Hold still.
It's a bumpy ride once you
break through the water.
One at a time.
Veeves, you're going first.
- Wait.
- Ready?
Oh, my God.
Taylor, off the wall!
Where are we going?
I'll see you on the other side.
Just get off the wall.
Oh, my God, Cara.
I don't know.
You're gonna be fine.
Just hold your breath.
You ready?
Oh, man, what about
Furby and Hopper?
Once you break through, we'll
have all the time that we need.
Just hold your breath.
- Are you ready?
- I don't like this.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys?
Guys?
Whoa.
Holy shit.
Hey, Furby.
Holy shit.
Wanna go to Mars?
Welcome back.
Dude, this place is awesome.
Oh, here they come.
Veeves.
Mom?
Daddy!
Yeah.
We got a lot to talk about.
What the heck is this place?
Well, it's not quite home, but
at least we’re all together.
Together?
Like together-together?
Let's get you guys dried off.
No, goof.
Come on, I'll show you around.
A lot's changed, but
we're kind of a big
deal around here.
