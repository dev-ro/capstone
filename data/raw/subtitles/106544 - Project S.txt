Nowadays, drug traffickers use every...
conceivable method to ship drugs
They put the drugs into condoms...
then into the stomach, anus, even corpses
Including babies' corpses
Last year alone, there were over...
150 deaths by poison when...
broken condoms leak drugs into the...
internal organs
But drug traffickers who die this way...
are in the minority
Most pass through customs successfully
Fighting narcotics has always
been a very important mission to us...
at the Royal Hong Kong Police
We know this data well
Can you get to the point?
Most of the drugs coming through...
South-east Asia come from...
a drug lord named Chaibat
If we arrest him, the drugs on the...
market would be reduced by half
In what aspect can the Royal
Hong Kong Police help you?
What we need is a super cop
Well, let me think about it
I'll let you know tomorrow
Fix it for me, tell me tomorrow
Yes, sir
That's a senior officer for you...
delegate, then disappear
How true
Fix it for me
I knew it
Call Ka-kui for me
Yes, sir
Thank you
Yes, sir
Good morning, sir Morning
They're in a meeting
You can't ask Ka-kui to do this
Why not? Is he irresponsible?
He's very responsible
Does he disobey his seniors?
Whoever he disobeys must be bad
All you do is talk; you complain that...
I don't give him a promotion...
Here's a chance, but you stop me
You call this a chance?
A China labour camp is no joke!
Are you afraid he can't handle it?
If he can't, then no one can
I know: asking him to walk the beat...
is a waste of his talent, I know that
Now Interpol needs a super cop
Ka-kui is a super cop
But you won't let him do it
I know, but it's very dangerous
He's been with me for so long
How can I ask him to risk his life?
If you can't ask him, then I'll go back...
to Interpol and tell them...
no one in the Royal Hong Kong Police...
can so this, okay?
They should ask James Bond
Correct
Hello, sir
Uncle Bill
Come in, Ka-kui
I need you
Please, sit
What's so urgent?
I found you a great position
Duty desk at Sha Tau Kok precinct
Just sign here
Uncle Bill, let me do it
Isn't that what I'm doing?
Sha Tau Kok is great,
all that fresh air...
no need to walk the beat
I meant the Interpol job
You heard?
Let me do it
It's very dangerous
Uncle Bill, it be more dangerous...
to do a job every day...
that you feel nothing for...
and wait for the end of your shift
Do you need to discuss it with May?
No, I've already decided
Go home and pack
Yes, sir
Ka-kui
Yes?
Chief will be very happy
Aren't you happy?
I'd be happy if Chief will do this job
Are we too devious?
Yes, but you more so than l
Why?
You're my senior officer
Why do you have to go to camp?
You're not allowed to make phone calls
It's a special training camp
After this training, I may get a raise
You're not happy?
No, I hate it when you have those
special missions
Camp is best; it's safest
You won't be risking your life
This is my life insurance policy
This is my bank passbook
Why are you giving them to me?
You're the beneficiary; come
What's wrong?
My safety deposit box key
I have some foreign currency in there
Why are you giving me these things?
Aren't you coming back soon?
I'm worried it might take longer
Don't forget to pay my insurance fee...
and extend my banking services
What are you doing?
I'll be gone a whole month!
You'll be late
I won't get shot for it
Remember, no dating boys
No dating boys for you
May
Uncle Bill
One month will be over soon
I'll watch him for you
I must go, bye
Bye!
Goodbye, Uncle Bill
Your ID and air ticket to Guangzhou
Yes, sir
Be careful
Don't worry
China's Public Security Department
will give its full support
Then I'd worry more
Uncle Bill, say something nice
The best thing to say is "Good luck"
With this mission...
the Royal Hong Kong Police...
releases Ka-kui like a kite
The thread may break in the wind
Don't make these dangerous metaphors
Don't worry
If the thread breaks, I'll fly back
I told you he's smart
Good luck
Thank you, sir
Uncle Bill, I must go
Then, really "good luck"
Yes, sir Ka-kui
Stop nagging, will you?
In an emergency, call this number
Remember this number
Tear up the paper afterwards
I remember it
I'm going
I'll tear it up for you
I'm going
Thank you
I'm making phone calls, don't disturb me
My phone number again
Great, I'll let the world know
Come in, please
Please sit
You're the super cop sent by Hong Kong?
The file from Hong Kong says:
Chan ka-kui parenthesis super cop
Super cops in Hong Kong...
are like goods in a supermarket:
Plentiful, and cheap
This young man is modest
We are one big family
We will do our best to assist you
Thank you all
Because your mission is very dangerous,
and we feel you do not understand
the situation inside China...
we have arranged for some lessons
To learn what?
Superintendent Yang from Interpol
will make arrangements for you
This is Superintendent Yang
How are you, Superintendent Yang?
Study hard
Yes, sir
You two talk together

would be such a pretty girl
You may speak Cantonese with me

Are they all your subordinates?
Grandpa's
What does that mean?
The country's: but under my command
Chan Ka-kui Yes?
You're dead! You're Lin Fu-seng
You trapped me: you're evil
The men you'll be dealing with are worse
So I want you to be very careful
When do we leave?
According to reliable sources,
Chaibat has bribed mercenaries...
to spring Pao from the labour camp
We're just waiting for the right time
Those pictures will suffice?
The powers of modern technology
I know, but I don't know Wushu
Your file says you're a wrestling champion
That's just street-fighting
At the academy, we learned karate,
Taekwondo,
Boxing; Chinese kung-fu...
was not a part of it
This is "Hard Qigung"?
You didn't learn this?
Of course not: you're just standing
and getting hit: how stupid
Superintendent Yang
Comrade Wang: let me introduce...
our Head Coach of the Militia
The super cop from Hong Kong

What can I say?
Then I must learn from you
Of course
Stop training
Gather
Sit
Please
Must you do this to me?
We welcome the super cop from Hong Kong
Come
Is this some kind of a joke?
You'll be fine
Will he really hit me?
No
Stop the match if something happens

Your reputation is justified
Let's go again
Thank you
Please, play a little longer
How does this work?
Simple; hold here...

Next time, you must say I'm
world champion in somersault
No more playing; our mission starts now
Do I look like I'm playing?
They have 3 vehicles, 6 men
Do you remember the coal mine's layout?
Yes
I may not be good at anything...
but my memory is my strong point
Really? I hope you remember where
the high passage is
Don't worry, my life depends on it
Tell your men not to shoot
Some of the guards have no bullets

requires a bullet-proof vest?
I'll tell you tomorrow
Come, watch Boss play his video game
Boss, Qiang betrayed Kunchat
Shall we have him dive?
Do the usual
Boss
Lawyer Chan is calling long distance
He needs to speak to you
Chan? Yes
Out of the way
Throw him in
He betrayed Boss
He deserves it
Come up
The phone, Boss
I don't care of we win or lose the lawsuit
But you must ask her to return the
bank code
Don't try your best, you must do it
I know how to reward good work
General
Welcome, Khun Chaibat
Too much rainfall in the Golden Triangle...
caused a bad harvest
I'm afraid I don't have goods for you
Where are your goods?
I can only get 30%, that's not enough
I don't care what you guys want,
I want 3 tons
You heard it, the two of them already...
took half of my stock
Give me the rest
Sorry, I reserved the rest long ago
Don't give anything to others
Do you set the rules now?
You think you're Bush?
I just to tell you today
I won't have any goods for you this year
So the purpose of today's meeting...
is to divide up my share
Is mine not business?
Does my money stink?
Who dares say that
But I've heard...
who hasn't paid for the previous delivery?
I haven't
I have a lot of money in a Swiss bank
If someone had not notified the
Malaysian police...
and had my wife arrested...
I would not owe you
You wife was arrested in Malaysia?
She may tell them about us
Control yourself
Chaibat, you cannot take action
He betrayed me
Talk is cheap
You intend to threaten us? With what?
With what?
General, this is good stuff
What is the matter?
It's a signal from Boss
Let me see
Don't move
No one shoot
These vests are packed with dynamite
I just fire one shot
We will all die together
Boss
Is my sister all right
Don't worry
She'll be fine with Boss
When you hear the explosion...
deal with those two guys for me
Can you do it?
Yes
Good
Put down your gun
Don't think you can take advantage...
of me, and betray me...
because you speak the same language
Chaibat, please understand
I am a businessman
If you have so many private matters...
solve it before you talk to me
Let's go out
General!
I did it, so what?
No one may leave this hut
Surround the hut
I've put up with you long enough
Don't even think about leaving here today
Shoot if you dare, fire!
