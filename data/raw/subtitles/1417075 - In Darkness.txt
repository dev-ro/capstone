TO MAREK EDELMAN
Szczepek!
Leave it.
Shine the light.
Tell them there's nothing of value here!
He says his parents left nothing behind.
- What are you doing with this Kraut?
- None of your business!
- Hands up, Polack pig!
- Shoot!
Go on!
Shoot!
Go ahead, shoot!
Get yourself a Polish man to fuck!
Where were you?
A blocked pipe.
Was it blocked with chickens?
She needs fresh fruit or
she'll be coughing until summer:
Fresh fruit?
At her age I didn't even know
what an orange was.
At her age you were living
on the street.
Leave her alone, will you?
Leave her be!
- We need to get up.
- It's Sunday
- I have to go to Mass.
- There's still time.
No tickling!
Stop that, you fool!
Something bit me.
- Can you see anything?
- What?
I can't see a thing.
It itches terribly Scratch me, Poldek.
Quiet!
You'll wake Stefcia!
IN DARKNESS
You're making too much noise!
Get the ladder:
Come on, get over here!
Go on, hurry up, move on!
Dance!
Put your hands up. Up!
Hold him down.
Say cheese...
Klara...
Give him 200.
See you next week.
- Hello.
- Hello, Szczepek.
Hey Yid!
What is it?
That's for the fake engagement ring
you sold me.
Marysia is expecting a nice present
for her Saints' Day
Give her a good fuck
and be done with it.
I'm serious.
- We have to sell this shit.
- Not now, the market's bad.
This shit's worth nothing right now.
You can buy decent jewelry
from a Yid for a few sausages.
- Patience, Szczepek.
- Patience?
Marysia's going to leave me.
Aleksy, this new neighbor of hers...
She says they're just friends,
but I'm sure the bastard's fucking hen
He's clever: He knows how to talk.
The fucking bastard!
Poldek...
I love hen
So beat her!
If you love a woman, beat her!
- Do you beat Wanda?
- She beats me!
You're teasing me again!
Hear that?
That...
- What's that?
- From the ghetto.
We're through!
We've done it!
The sewer is ours!
So we meet again.
It's Swiss. Take it.
It's worth a lot. Don't you believe me?
If you don't get at least 500...
you can turn us in.
We'd get more if we reported you.
Alright.
500...
plus the watch.
- 500 and the watch.
- No, no, no.
I'll handle it. I will go up...
-for the money
- We'll come with you. Just in case.
Krysia!
Krysia!
Stop it, or you'll both go back
into the closet!
- Paulina, what are they doing here?
- They needed some fresh air:
Just for a few minutes.
Don't be angry Ignacy
I'll be right back.
- What's your name?
- Pirate.
Perfect name for a thief.
I know the sewers better
than I know my own wife.
- It's no place for you.
- There is no place for us anywhere.
But I know places where it could work.
For the right price.
Name your price.
500 a day
- Agreed.
- Poldek...
- they'll hang us.
- Listen, don't worry
The young one...
- he's scared, he'll betray us.
- Never trust a Polack.
It's four against two.
We can easily finish them off.
We can't just kill them.
Why not? it's war!
It'll end in a massacre.
Twenty of ours for one of theirs.
- No one has to know.
- Forget it. We have no choice!
We can always turn them in later:
First let's see how much they have.
So, do we have a deal?
Here's a down payment.
You'll get the rest when we need you.
- How will we find you?
- Don't worry I'll find you.
Fuck, I should've asked for more.
Socha?
Socha!
Bortnik!
My Ukrainian friend!
- It's been years!
- Good to see you, brother!
I'm a commander now.
Szczepek here works with me.
I know Bortnik...
-from Lonski!
- You were in jail?
- I had no choice.
- Szczepek, listen...
Lonski was full of sons of bitches.
But not Poldek. He could be trusted.
I will never forget it. Cheers.
Cheers!
Your best vodka for my friends!
You know what this means?
It means I can help all my friends.
- Even the friends of my friends.
- May I?
If you need anything,
just ask.
I trained near the Baltic.
They're tough mothers.
But the Germans are the best thing...
to happen to the Ukrainians.
The Polacks, too.
Cheers!
Poldek!
Janek, your wife!
You'll wake her up.
Poldek, stop pulling my leg! I went
there for a drink like a gentleman...
and there, on the accordion,
was Ryszek Kynczel...
- Was Witek Szugenia there?
- Yes, he was, I'm telling you.
And the Grochowiak girl,
she was there, too.
- So you started partying?
- Yes, I did. She's got these eyes...
like a little lost sheep, you know?
They look like a pair of diamonds...
- Krysia? Pawel?
- We're here, Mama.
This is my room!
- Go away! Stop pushing!
- Let us in!
Calm down, calm down!
Get out of my way
Make way!
- We're not coming with you, Janek.
- What?
It's her or us!
Now is not the time...
Do you think I don't know
what's going on?
I'm not blind!
It's her or us. Choose!
Father...
Take your prize, you bitch!
Home Wrecker:
Stop pushing!
Help me, please!
Help me please, I have a baby!
- Help me, please!
- Poldek, I want no part in this!
I've got a baby! Help me!
Go away!
Faster; come on, come on!
They get to go first.
- I'm sorry..
- Ignacy you go first.
Krysia insisted on wearing
her red boots.
Faster! Faster!
- Where is our Polack Moses now?
- So much for your down payment!
- Ignacy!
- No, it's dark in there!
- Krysia, please.
- No, no!
You'll be fine.
Give me your hand, Paulina.
Pirate!
- Krysia, it'll be alright.
- Mr. Chiger, are you there?
Thought we weren't coming, didn't you?
Klara, I'm not going!
No, it stinks down here.
Get in, Mania. Now!
- Klara, I'm begging you, I can't!
- Mania, please, come on.
- Krysia, please, you must go down.
- No, no!
- Krysia...
- No!
Listen. Listen to me!
Listen to me!
You will be safe down here,
but you must stop crying, you hear?
Mania, you can't stay here.
- But we are staying!
- Mania, please!
- Where's your bag?
- You can't stay here.
Where is it?
- You have to come with us!
- Don't tell me what to do!
Make way!
- Mania, come on, get down there!
- No, no!
Let me go!
Klara...
Get down there!
Be careful!
There's shit everywhere!
- Come on, Mania.
- No, I'm going back.
Mania, come on!
- If we don't keep up, we'll get lost!
- I'm going back!
- Are you deaf? We'll get lost!
- I don't want to be here.
- Do you think I want to be here?
- Leave me alone!
- Come on!
- I want to go home!
I won't always be here to take
care of you! Don't be such a baby!
- You're no longer a child! Understand?
- Klara...
Stay out of this, Mundek!
- Come on.
- I hate you, you bitch!
Mania...
They'll kill you up there.
Klara, she's your sister;
the only family you have.
We have to hurry Come on, please!
You could've brought some food instead!
Can't we rest for a few minutes?
When I say so!
Children first.
Fucking hell.
Everyone and their dog came down!
Bunch of lice.
Out of the way
Out of the way!
Get away!
Make room for the children!
Mrs. Chiger; over here.
Sit down, Pawel.
You will stay here for now.
It's so dirty in here.
- I'm thirsty
- They suck out all the air!
Szczepek!
Come...
- Stop, Yid, or I'll shoot!
- Don't shoot!
I'm not a Yid!
- I know Bortnik. He's my friend.
- Hands up!
- Antoni's in the ghetto.
- All Ukrainians are my friends.
- Come on, we'll check it.
- Keep your hands up!
Left here!
Hey Bortnik, this guy says
he knows you.
He's okay
Let him go.
- Socha, what are you doing here?
- I work here. The sewer was blocked.
You're lucky they found me.
See any Jews down there?
Just bodies. They caused the blockage.
- Tell me if you find any live ones.
- Absolutely!
- It's our duty
- Yes.
Herr Officer!
Watch out!
You look like hell.
Hard day at work.
If you like, I'll draw you a bath.
Did you hear it?
I doubt if there's anything
left of the ghetto.
Did you see anything?
Those poor people.
They're offering rewards
for turning in Jews.
Some people are making a pile.
God will punish the greedy
The Jews crucified Jesus.
It's written in the Bible:
"His blood be upon them and
their children." The priest said so.
That's just church politics.
Just think about it.
Jews are just the same as us.
Our Lady and the apostles,
they're all Jews!
Even Jesus.
Jesus?
Mania...
Have you seen Mania?
Mania. Have you seen Mania?
Has anyone seen Mania?
Is Mania your sister?
She stepped on me as she was leaving.
She left?
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.
She was crying.
Said she didn't want to die here.
I must...
I must find hen
Klara...
- You can't go out there!
- I must find her!
Where is she?
Klara...
Where is she?
Go and find her!
Find hen
Having a party Mr. Socha?
Some sausages.
Good morning.
440 zlotys.
Really? That's steep!
Onions are ten zlotys.
Last week they were five!
You can afford it, Mr. Socha.
A week ago your wife...
had no cash and now
suddenly you're shopping...
for an army
Basia, do you want some candy?
Smartass.
I love you.
Listen to this nonsense
from Mr. Goebbels...
"Our heroes in the East will prevail
over the Bolsheviks and Jews...
in the steppes."
And get slaughtered in Stalingrad!
I never thought I'd miss the ghetto.
Unbelievable, isn't it?
You're welcome to go back!
Be quiet!
The Germans are losing, that's obvious.
You have to read between the lines.
- The Germans...
- Mr. Chiger, we all know...
you speak their fucking language.
The language of Heinrich Heine.
You should learn it.
But I suppose in your view ignorance
is bliss. Right, Mr. Grossmann?
I've brought food.
Take it easy calm down!
Stop it! Stop pushing!
- That's ours!
- Stay calm!
- Calm down, you'll kill each other!
- That's our bread!
Take it easy I said.
Is the campaign in the ghetto over?
My sister went back there.
To the ghetto?
Anyone left alive was taken
to Janowska Camp.
The ghetto is empty
You...
you...
and you...
come with me.
Szczepek, you stay here.
No, no, no.
Look!
We'll move you here. it's safer:
For you or for us?
There are lots of hiding places here.
How do we all fit into this shit hole?
I didn't promise to take care of every
Jew in Lvov Too many is dangerous.
Exactly how many can be saved?
Ten.
Make it twelve or fourteen at least!
Ten, eleven at the most.
I've chosen seven.
And who made you God, Grossmann?
It was my room. I took all the risk.
- And the idea was mine, too.
- Which I'm paying for!
That makes you better than us?
Before the war we'd never have been
in the same room!
What a joke! Listen to the professor...
who refuses to speak Yiddish!
All your education didn't
buy you any sense.
Bringing children into such a hell!
You fool!
Better to leave them with the Germans.
- Like your loverboy did with his.
- Stop it, you bitch!
Quiet. Be quiet!
You old bitch!
- This is pointless! Enough!
So?
There's the four of us, Mundek...
Klara, Janek, Berestycki...
That makes eight.
Chaja,
- Landsberg.
- Why Landsberg?
- He's a cripple!
- At least not a mental cripple!
So, Landsberg makes ten...
- Frankiel eleven.
- Speak Polish, damn it!
And Irena?
- Frankiel is more useful.
- I'm staying here anyway..
I don't trust these Polacks.
Who's coming?
- There's twelve of us.
- I said ten.
- I'm staying here. - You have to come.
- Why? - Because I say so!
I'm begging you...
Twelve. Like the twelve apostles.
A Yid wouldn't know,
but the twelfth was Judas!
There were always twelve.
After Judas there was Matthias.
Okay twelve, but that's it!
- You can come with us.
- Daniel, too?
I'm not coming without him. And what
about those kids? They have no one.
Thirteen? Fourteen? Sixteen?
Give a Jew a finger
and he'll take your arm!
- I'm begging you...
- No!
Eleven or no one.
You can always leave your kids
behind, if you like, Mrs. Chiger.
We'll wait here.
Come on.
Krysia!
Krysia, come on.
Here you go, little one.
We're grateful for all you've done...
But 500 a day for only eleven
is a lot...
Out of which I buy all your bread,
potatoes and sugar!
- Yes, but you still earn...
- A mere 70 zlotys...
that I share with Szczepek.
You're bargaining over your own life.
You're just like any other Yid!
Wait.
Wait!
Goddamned rats!
Come here.
Come on.
Goddamned vermin!
Are you cold? We'll be alright.
Don't be afraid, little one.
Mama, will they bite us?
- Marysia will love this!
- There's blood on it.
I'll wash it out. it's the perfect size.
- For your Stefcia. - They're hideous!
- Give them to hen
A ghetto souvenir from Uncle Szczepek.
There you are! Speak of the devil!
I was just asking your charming wife
where you were.
You've got Jews living in your sewers!
- Poldek knows nothing about it.
- Like I said, I only saw corpses.
A woman on Peltewna Street
could smell fried onions.
It came from her toilet.
I could smell it myself. Look.
They must be here.
If we enter the sewer here, it can't
be far Can we get down there?
- Well, yes.
- So let's go.
Come on, Poldek, let's go!
No one knows the sewers
better than your husband!
Listen, I live in a beautiful home.
Want to know who gave it to us?
Some rich Yid family I never even met!
Poldek,
the Germans pay 500 cash
for every Jew we catch.
Let's hope we'll find
some Jews in the sewers.
Preferably rich ones.
Look.
- Idiot, you announced us! Be quiet!
- The rat scared me, sir:
God, what a stench.
You could choke to death in here.
Poldek!
Isn't it this way?
Well...
Poldek...
Fuck it!
I can check over there, if you want.
Alright. Check it out.
Nothing here.
Fuck! The shit's ruined my boots!
Take me outside.
- No way it's much too dangerous.
- Please! Just for a little bit.
My shoes are broken.
I don't know.
How are the children?
It's only a rat.
Come on, sit down.
She took one look
at the tablecloth and said...
it was nice. "Nice!" After all the
trouble I took to clean it!
- So I told her to fuck off.
- Szczepek!
Then she told me she'd rather
Aleksy anyway
Wanda, we have to find Szczepek
a woman like you...
just a little younger:
New?
This here? From Mr. Chiger.
- It's Swiss.
- Mr. Chiger?
Yes, he's one of our Jews.
Hasn't Poldek told you about...?
Jews, Poldek?
We found some Jews in the sewers.
- And you're helping them?
- Mrs. Socha...
Wanda...
they pay us.
So that's your "raise".
You said the Jews were just like us.
- That Jesus was a Jew.
- This is different.
- Jesus was a Jew?
- I did it for you and Stefcia!
- Don't you dare say you did it for us!
- Wanda!
Don't you touch me!
Is that really true? Jesus was a Jew?
Janek!
Chaja.
Bortnik, how are you?
Lousy
Didn't I tell you?
They were there, the bastards!
They found a bunch of Yids
in your sewer; you hear?
What? Where?
- We missed out!
- How many?
I don't know.
Their bodies were left to rot.
They must've had help.
Otherwise they could never
have survived this long.
What do you think, Poldek?
- If I get my hands on the bastard!
- Fucking hell, all that money!
Bortnik, if there are any Yids left,
don't worry they're ours!
Stay let's have a drink.
Make haste slowly!
I'll get the next round.
- Will you join me?
- We have work to do.
Coming, Szczepek?
You look like you could use
another drink.
You heard the boss.
A shot of vodka for me!
Let's go! Hurry up!
What if they talked before
they were killed?
Then we'd be dead by now.
- No, Poldek!
- What?
Come on!
I can't help you any more.
What did you say?
- What about ours?
- They must not know.
So they're alright?
Who led the Krauts here?
You?
Go to hell, you vermin!
Give it back! That's my crayon!
- Mama, he won't give it back!
- It's mine!
Give it back, it's my crayon...
- Give it to her; Pawel.
- Let go, it's my crayon, I out it!
Look at that idiot!
God isn't listening!
Come on...
Give it back, Pawel!
- Children, be quiet.
- Mama! Give it back!
Hey Janek!
Stop it!
Janek, Janek! Stop, stop it!
- Calm down.
- I will shoot, I swear!
- Get away!
- Calm down... - Janek.
Stop crying or I'll shoot! I swear!
Get away from me!
I swear!
- Calm down, calm down!
- Stop this damned praying!
- God isn't here!
- Janek, put the gun down!
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.
Janek, calm down.
Come on, put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
Mundek?
Where's Janowska?
It must be around there
to the left somewhere.
Klara!
I am... "Cinder...girl'?"
- Cinderella.
- Cinderella.
Do they fit?
Do you miss Leipzig?
I haven't seen my family in four years.
The letters stopped coming two years
ago. I have no home any more.
The German who hanged my father...
the one...
who actually pulled the rope...
had just promised to save him.
Papa made me promise...
to take care of Mania...
She's very spoiled...
but she has a good heart.
We always fought, so he had to
make me promise.
- Well?
- The flame looks good.
They got the others, not ours.
- Any change?
- It's safe.
There's no methane today
- Did you hear what I said? The Jews...
- Jews?
What Jews?
'Tickets...
'Tickets...
Curtain!
The gate is already closed.
The people sleep, the birds sleep,
the cats and the dogs sleep, too.
So close your little eyes.
Everyone's asleep...
so you should sleep, too.
If I earn 200 zlotys...
I will buy you a beautiful house.
Then you will sleep like a princess
on a bed of white roses.
Good night. Now close your eyes.
And this house will have a garden...
and a choir of singing birds.
They will sing you
sweet fairy tales till dawn.
Good night. Now close your eyes.
You sing beautifully Krysia.
Wonderful!
Klara, take this.
I have run out of money Mr. Socha.
But don't worry..
Right after the Germans entered,
I hid some jewelry
Put me down, you idiot, put me down!
I want to show you something.
It's Chiger's. I'm supposed to sell it.
Wanda, you'd never have to work again.
You'd have your own maid.
They're not even grateful
for anything I've done for them.
All they do is demand.
It's gone.
It was in the left pocket. Gone!
It's gone.
I've looked here, too.
Maybe... it's over there.
- I've looked everywhere.
- It was stolen. - Yes.
They took it.
Get down, get down!
I signaled.
Why so scared?
We were worried you wouldn't come back.
Or with the Gestapo.
Where's Janek?
He ran off.
- With Frankiel and Landsberg.
- They'll be caught and...
.Janek will never talk! Never!
I'm glad you have such faith in him.
Never!
I thought you were going to sell them.
I won't be coming back.
I'm risking my life, my family's life,
for what?
Complaints and accusations.
And now this betrayal.
Enough. This is too much.
Szczepek was right.
Mundek!
- He'll run straight to the Gestapo.
- He could've done that ages ago!
- He could've kept the jewels!
- Mundek!
- We should've killed him long ago.
- He didn't have to come back!
Are you crazy?
I'm very sorry Mr. Socha.
You'll die here like dogs.
Mr. Socha!
Are you happy now?
Mr. Socha!
Are you thirsty?
Are you tired?
Go on, lie down.
That's nice!
Is that nice?
- We need to do another job.
- What?
- Two addresses we haven't hit.
- Oh, I thought...
What?
The Jews.
What Jews?
Poldek...
I wasn't just scared for myself.
My Marysia's pregnant.
Is it yours or Aleksy's?
