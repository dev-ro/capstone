- [v/o] I came to see you
in hospital
after your accident, but...
you didn't know who I was.
I went looking for you
when you got out,
but you were gone.
- Why were you looking for me?
- I might have a few days
work for you,
if you're interested.
Nothing physical.
- Doing what?
- Babysitting.
My brother Ed died last year.
He had a daughter, Olga.
She keeps going out to the house
where he died.
The place is in the middle
of nowhere...
and I don't like the idea of her
being out there on her own.
She's out there now.
I've been looking for someone
to go out there
and keep her company.
I'd like to send someone
I know.
What do you think?
I'll give you 200 a day.
I can't imagine you'll be there
for more than five days.
- How did your brother die?
- Suicide.
- Where's her mother?
- Missing.
Vanished eight months ago.
- She's your niece.
Why don't you go yourself?
- Honestly,
I couldn't take a week
alone with her.
She's got some
psychological problems.
She goes into these states,
she gets confused,
but she's harmless.
- So 200 a day,
just to go to the house
and keep her company?
- That's it.
- There's got to be
more to it than that.

You didn't say anything about

You agreed to go to the house.

Olga, we're here.

screaming.
You ever hear
a teenage girl scream?
- No.
- [scoffs] Sure.
There's something I didn't
mention before.
It's not really a big deal.
Olga's a little paranoid.
She doesn't like people getting
too close to her physically.
And she doesn't want anybody
going into her room,
especially at night.
- That's fine.
- What's fine?
- Stay out of her room.
- Well it's not

She has this odd fear that
she'll be attacked in her sleep.
If I could find a woman willing
to go on the boat with me,
I'd hire her, but...
[door creaks open]

was a sleepwalker.
She used to wear this at night
to stop her walking out
into the woods.
- And why are you
showing it to me?
- I need you to put this on.
Well the chain's long enough.
You'll be able to walk around.
It just won't let you into

- I have no interest
in going into her room.

than just your word.
Turn around,
I'll strap you in.

the problem is.
It's a job.
Every job has a uniform.
- That's not a uniform.
That's a leash,
and I'm not putting it on.
- Well then we have a problem.
She'll only agree to have
someone stay with her
if they wear this.
- No.
- I don't like to have my time wasted.
- Look.
You didn't say anything
about an island.
And you sure as shit didn't say
anything about wearing a leash.
If you had,
I wouldn't be here.
So this is not my problem.

He went down

he shot himself.
