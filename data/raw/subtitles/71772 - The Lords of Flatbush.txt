A new student...
...has just transferred
into our class today.
Miss Jane Bradshaw.
Please say hello.
Hello, Jane!
Class, I have some instructions
for you on fire drills.
I have some instructions
for you on fire drills...
...so get out your paper
and take them down.
Mr. Cohen, you're late.
No, I'm not.
I just saw the principal...
...and he says he's gotta talk to you.
Class, I have to go to the principal's
office. But before I go...
...Mr. Cohen will pass out
these papers.
Put your last name first, and your
first name last at the top...
...followed by today's date
and the period.
Which, for your
information, is homeroom.
Now, I'll be... Class!
I'll be right back, so please
have those sheets filled out.
She believed me!
That's it, get the blackboard.
Here she comes!
Mr. Cohen, where is my chalk?
Take a look in your desk, Miss Molina.
You might find some chalk there.
Mr. Rosiello! Mr. Murgalo!
Mr. Tyrell!
I am separating the three
of you for your own good.
Mr. Rosiello, you come
right up here in front of me.
And Mr. Murgalo,
you sit in the last row.
Where is Mr. Tyrell?
You stay there.
Thank you.
Mr. Rosiello.
Come on up here, Mr. Rosiello.
I am keeping you separated so we don't
have any more delinquent behaviour.
Is that clear?
Sit down!
Copy this information down.
Mr. Rosiello, what do you
think you are doing?
There's a draft blowing across that
seat. I just thought I'd move back.
Okay, just don't
make me throw you out.
No, I won't do that.
Got another draft, Mr. Rosiello?
I don't know what it is.
Wherever I sit, there's a draft
or the sun's in my eyes.
You don't mind if I move back, do you?
Sit down.
Now if you will all settle down
and stop moving about...
...maybe we could
learn something today.
Don't you agree?
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
And don't come back until
you have a letter from your mother.
Do you hear me?
I'll see you at The Hotdog Man, okay?
And I'll see you too, sweetmeat.
- Hi, David.
- Hi, Ma.
- Why don't you drink out of a glass?
- That's a glass.
- I'm making you a sandwich.
- Oh, blackout!
Don't eat cake.
I don't want a sandwich.
You're gonna ruin your appetite.
You're gonna ruin your teeth.
- I'm gonna ruin my face.
- David...
- I gotta go.
- What do you mean? You just came in!
I've already eaten lunch, okay?
I'm expecting you home for supper.
Don't worry about it.
I'll be there.
Let's go, let's go!
Strike one!
Right over there.
- Strike one, right?
- Strike, right over the plate.
Look at this!
- Hey! Look there!
- Hey, mama!
You're breaking my heart.
You hear me?
Hey! You know how to play chess?
Hey, hey! Cool it you guys!
Why don't you put an egg
in your shoe and beat it?
Scram, honey.
Dog.
- Hi, Stanley.
- Hi, Fran.
You know what I just bought?
A great new outfit for tonight.
I have to go. I'm late.
Annie, come on.
I'll see you tonight.
See you tonight, Chico.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
You wanna play a little 9-ball?
Buck a throw?
Rack them up. I'll break.
Okay, I'm gonna take the deuce
in the caboose.
The three the same way.
The four out the back door.
What kind of a thing is that?
The Lord's? What is it, some
kind of club or something?
It's what you might call
a social athletic club.
You know, we play a little ball,
bust a few heads.
You ever hear of the Jay's?
No. Where are they from?
Avenue J.
Oh, yeah. I think I remember
hearing about them.
- We broke up.
- What did you have, a lovers' quarrel?
You remind me of a guy I knew.
He used to be in the Jay's.
A little short guy. We used
to call him "Mouse."
What else can you call him?
He's only 5-foot-3.
I tell you something.
First of all, I'm not 5-foot-3,
I'm 5-foot-6.
And second of all, it ain't the size.
It's whether or not you got balls.
You're 100% right. You got balls,
you got nothing to worry about.
You look like you can handle yourself.
I do all right, you know.
I do better in groups, you know?
If I get in trouble,
I can snap my fingers...
...and the Lord's come running.
I feel good around my friend Stanley.
He's what you'd call my insurance.
- Hey, Wimp!
- Hey, Stan.
Hey, Chico.
Here you go, pool player.
I didn't get your name. What is it?
Used to call me Moose.
But everybody calls me Mambo.
Moose Mambo. This is Stanley,
and this is Chico.
- Moose, huh?
- Mambo.
If you're Moose, your
friends must be killers, huh?
What do you mean?
Don't pay no attention
to the Fig Newton.
How many times a day
I got to threaten your life?
Chic, you ever hear of
the Jay's, man?
It's a bird, ain't it?
You wouldn't talk like that
on Avenue J.
Well, I'll tell you something
about Avenue J.
I eat Avenue J.
Hey, Moosey?
Let's say you and me play
a little game of pool.
- Good idea.
- Yeah, I'll rack them up.
Five dollars a throw, right?
Good.
- Go ahead and break.
- Give me my dollar back.
I think it's my shot.
Normally it would be.
- This ain't no game for me, man.
- But here we play by my rules.
You lose a fin.
Listen, I'll see you guys around.
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?
- Watch it.
- Who's he?
He's the guy that's gonna
tell me to kill you.
- Tell you to what?
- Kill you.
Maybe one at a time...
...but not three against one.
Hey, do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am? Huh?
I tell you something.
I don't like punks coming in
here to mouth off. Understand?
I don't like it.
Take off, Moose man.
- See you around.
- Take off.
I like that guy. He's all right.
He's got balls, you know?
If he can't beat me,
he's okay.
Come on, Wimp.
Rack them up, will you?
This is the outfit I was telling
you about this afternoon.
I got it special, just for you.
- Give me a hand with the blanket.
- Sure.
You know, Chico?
I don't know why I came here tonight.
Take your boots off
and put them on the corners.
I thought you were gonna take me out
for a change. I got all dressed up.
You look terrific.
Do I?
Do you think maybe tomorrow night
we could go into New York City?
You know, like maybe to the Roxy
or something really classy?
Yeah, we can do that.
Chico, you know
you're getting fresh.
Chico, no.
Chico, you know...
...this is where Frannie got pregnant
by Stanley not too long ago.
Oh, my God!
You made a mess.
Can we go to Lindy's now so I can
get some clams on the half shell?
Yeah, we'll see.
- Did you say Frannie's pregnant?
- I didn't say that.
I stand corrected.
What's she gonna do?
Stanley's gonna marry her,
that's what she's gonna do.
You know something, Chico?
There are a lot worse things in
this world than getting married.
Hello, is Jane there?
Yes, sir, I realize it's late,
but I've been trying to get her.
Would you tell her
Carl Erskine is calling?
Hello, Jane?
Yeah, it's Chico from class.
I'm glad you brought me here.
Yeah, I am too.
I love it.
Come on, let's go this way.
Come on!
Slow down! I gotta get off.
What do you mean, you gotta get off?
I'll see you later.
Come on, Chico, I'm gonna
get in trouble.
Not till you give me a kiss.
Stop following me!
Come on!
You gotta give me a kiss!
That wasn't a kiss.
Come back here!
I'm letting you off easy.
I'm late.
For what?
My friend. I'm a month late
with my friend.
What friend is that, Fran?
I'm pregnant.
That rubber band didn't work.
What you gonna do?
Tell me who the guy is
and I'll kill him.
What are you gonna do?
Me? I'm doing nothing.
What do I gotta do?
What do I gotta do?
We can announce our
engagement next week.
No, Fran. No way.
You.
You're the one who's pregnant.
Not me, you.
Why me, Fran? Why not some
of these other guys?
You know there's nobody else.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Damn, why aren't you pretty?
How would you like me to tell those guys
that you cry when you come?
Okay, Fran. Listen to me.
That's enough.
Fran, you sure about this?
Yes, Stanley. I'm sure.
- What am I gonna tell my mother?
- I don't know.
What do I say to the priest
in confession?
What kind of clothes
am I gonna wear to school?
I don't know, Fran.
Listen, I know a guy...
...who knows a guy downtown. I guess
he usually handles these things.
- You're gonna be a father.
- I don't wanna be a father.
I'm too young to be a father.
But you're old enough
to make me pregnant.
And to go in the Army.
If I'm married, I wouldn't
have to go in the Army, huh?
It would be terrific.
We could get our own television
and watch American Bandstand.
We could buy a house in
the neighbourhood...
...and my mother could live downstairs.
Maybe she'd even pay the mortgage.
Listen to me.
You sound like we got a...
...a license already. You know?
Fran, I don't wanna get married.
Really, I don't wanna get married.
Besides, you're too skinny
to be pregnant.
You're too skinny.
I love you.
My parents wanna meet you.
These are my parents...
...Colonel and Mrs. Bradshaw.
Chico Tyrell.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
We've heard a lot about you.
Jane told us you're
in some of her classes...
...and that you met at
a fraternity party.
Excuse me for a moment, would you?
Certainly, dear.
Are you a member of that fraternity?
I belong to the Lord's.
Is that a fraternity?
It's what you might call
a social athletic club.
I see.
You play a regular position
or something?
No, nothing set.
We just sort of take turns,
if you know what I mean.
Look who's here.
Nancy, what are you doing out of bed?
Chico, this is Jane's sister, Nancy.
My sister says you're cute.
Well, your sister tells me
you got a cold.
Chico's right. You be a good girl
and run on up to bed, okay?
- I don't wanna.
- We'll be home soon...
...and we'll bring you something.
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.
- Don't forget to bring me something.
- We won't, dear. Good night.
Come on, Pat. Let's go.
It's not right to keep
everybody waiting.
I'm very happy to have
met you, Chico.
We'll be in the Officer's Club
at Fort Hamilton.
We'll be home early if I can get your
mother away from the general.
Good night, Mom and Daddy.
Have a good time.
You're gonna be the most
beautiful bride.
Coming from you, that's
really important to me.
I can just see you now, walking down
the aisle of that church.
How will it sound when I say...
..." Bless me, Father, for I have
sinned. I'm pregnant."
I'm sure he's heard that
so many times before.
You think so?
Of course! That's why it's called
"Our Lady of a Thousand Sorrows."
You gonna throw me a shower?
That's for me to know
and for you to find out.
- Oh, come on!
- I'm not gonna tell you.
We're here to look for rings.
Do you see anything you like?
What about this one?
Frannie, that's all yellowy!
Are you Mr. Birnbaum
of Birnbaum Brothers?
I'm his son.
Can I help you?
Yes, you can. We'd like to see
that ring, please.
Who's it for?
It's for my friend here.
- Is this the one?
- That's it.
It's a beautiful ring.
Come on, try it on.
- Look at it!
- That is just gorgeous.
That is the most stunning thing
I have ever seen in my whole life.
Oh, it's gorgeous!
- I gotta have it.
- Definitely.
- It's me.
- I know.
Annie, it's really me.
I've never seen anything
so beautiful in my whole life.
What'll Stanley say?
Just tell him to get a job
from 9 to 5.
But he won't be
able to go to college.
Excuse me, but how much is that ring?
Let me see.
This is our one-and-a-half-carat
marquise setting...
...with the two baguettes.
$1600.
$1600?
That is including
the baguettes, of course.
Of course.
Do you have a layaway plan here?
Yes, we do.
Well, that's good.
What time you open till?
We're open till 9 every night.
Could you put that ring away for
us and we'll be back and pick it up?
Of course I can.
- Don't sell it to anyone else.
- I won't sell it to anybody else.
We'll definitely be back.
- I'll look for you.
- Thank you.
- Thanks for calling.
- Bye-bye. See you later.
We have to get your shoes
and the bag and the gloves.
What are you doing out of bed?
I want a glass of water.
Get it. But hurry
and get back to bed.
Go on!
Good night.
Good night, Nancy.
- Good night, Chico.
- Good night.
Go on.
Don't do that.
Please stop.
It's all right, baby.
It's okay. I won't hurt you.
- I love you.
- No!
What colour are my eyes?
Purple.
You know, it's just that you make me
very nervous sometimes, Chico.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I wouldn't make you so
nervous if I wasn't here, okay?
All right.
Here they are, my man.
Okay, cut the cards, Murgalo.
You're in a hurry to lose, huh?
Here you go. All shuffled.
Okay, 10 times a day.
I win, you lose.
Hey, Casanova! What you doing?
Banzai!
Tell me about the new piece.
She's a girl, man.
She's beautiful.
- Beautiful? She's ugly!
- You're blind.
I wanna know what happened, man.
You take a dip in the pool
or something?
Get her on the beach?
What's it to you, man?
Did you tell her we all share
and share alike around here?
I'm sorry. I didn't mention you guys.
You didn't come up
in the conversation.
You didn't tell her about us?
Not even me, Chico?
What are you, a loon?
Get your hands on
those lemons?
- Lemons?
- Grapes.
- Grapes?
- Pits?
Pits!
Come on. What did you do?
Do you wanna get your
rocks off on my dates?
I'm gonna forget you said that.
You've got your own little
pepperoni, man.
Why don't we trade hits?
Chico, why don't we trade hits?
Wait. We trade hits and,
if you lose, you tell me everything.
What if I win?
I'm leaving if you win.
I'm leaving town if you win!
Come on, Chico.
My money is on Chico!
I don't want to mess up your hair.
You'll have to fix it.
I'm gonna take off my rings
so I don't hurt you.
Chico, when it's over...
...I want your bike.
I'll take good care of it.
You wanna go first?
Remember, if you lose,
you tell everything.
Knock it off!
Come on! Take it easy.
You all right?
Yeah, sure.
You all right? Cool?
Just set up a couple of egg creams
for me and Chico, right?
You better make it four egg creams.
Set them up.
You're okay, Chico.
You got skunked.
Hey, if it isn't Annie and Frannie!
Hey, Annie and Frannie!
- How they hanging?
- Hi, Wimps.
Hey, Chico! It's Annie,
from Frannie and Annie.
Hi, Chico.
Don't look at me, man.
I ain't here.
Hello, Chico.
What's the matter? Don't you
wanna see me anymore?
Yeah, I do.
I'm just doing my homework.
Do you think it's easy,
keeping up that average?
You're so mature!
What's the matter, Chico?
Really, don't you wanna
see me anymore?
You're acting like a real hyena, Chico.
If you get tired of Little Miss
White Bread, you could give me a call.
I tell you, if I want to call you,
I will. If I don't, I won't.
Well, if I'm around, I'll be there.
And if I'm not, I won't.
You know something, Chico?
I really don't understand you.
I really don't.
"You know something, Chico? I really
don't understand you. I really don't."
Let's go, Frannie.
She'll go when I tell her to go.
You can go.
Bye, Stanley. It was really
nice spending time with you again.
I wish I didn't care,
but he drives me crazy.
I know what you mean.
Hi, Jane.
See Jane run.
- Here's Jane running.
- Run, run, run.
Hey, Butch, look at this.
You know what Chico really needs?
Chico needs a car.
You wanna steal a car?
I can hot-wire any car in the world.
You steal it, I'll hot-wire it.
Don't worry, Chico!
Find the car, and I'll start it.
A car ain't been built
that I can't start.
Check out this garage.
I hope Chico appreciates this. We could
get our ass in a sling if we get caught.
What are you, stupid or something?
What's the matter?
Come on. Come on!
Don't you know how to sneak in a
place? Gotta be careful.
Shut your mouth!
Shut up!
I got the brains here.
Nobody tells me to shut up.
What are you doing?
Get off!
Well?
- I lied.
- You lied!
I seen it in a movie.
I thought I could do it.
We're counting on you,
and you're lying.
- Whose idea was this?
- It was your idea!
All right. Keep it down.
He's got the key!
- Will you start the car?!
- All right!
Slap down the choke!
Who said you could drive?
- I can drive.
- Get out of there!
- Shotgun!
- Bullshit!
Hey, man! We got a car!
We got a car!
Let her rip!
Martha, you make
the most beautiful spreads.
Annie, they'd never compare to you.
And the pineapple is beautiful.
Oh, look who's here!
David, how are you?
Oh, God! Look at how he's grown!
- I can't believe it's the same boy!
- How are you?
He looks just like you.
Thank you.
Can I have 10 bucks?
What are you gonna do with $10?
It's the same old story
all the time!
Is she a nice girl?
Is she worth $10?
Maybe you want to take out
my daughter? She's beautiful.
Don't be home late.
You'll be back by 11:30?
- So long, Ma.
- Have a good time.
- Have a piece of pineapple.
- No. That's okay, thanks.
With all the talking, how can you
remember what you're playing?
So long, Mom.
I'll be home early.
Come on, baby. It's a parking spot.
Whose car did you say this was?
I thought you'd like it.
I love it!
The juicy frank, sizzling hot.
There's delicious coffee,
freshly brewed.
And all kinds of ice cream
and candy to tempt you.
Come help yourselves to the big
variety of quality goodies.
Showtime will be announced
loud and clear...
...to get you back to your car in time.
So stretch your legs.
Come to the snack bar now.
Your eyes aren't purple.
They're blue!
I'm glad you called.
You trust me?
You trust me?
You trust me?
Did you miss me?
No.
What do you think?
Why didn't you tell me?
When you're alone
People look at you differently
On the edge
They treat you with dignity
Knowing you are alone
Knowing you...
...are all...
...alone
That was terrific.
Ain't exactly Ted Mack.
No, that was good.
We'll get better.
With practice.
I gotta go home.
- What for?
- I gotta be home at 12.
My mother waits up.
I'll see you tomorrow.
We steal Chico a car and we sit
here like a pack of schmucks.
I don't understand how he can
see the same broad every night.
He's probably having a good time.
You guys wanna go?
You guys are in a hurry. You can go.
You don't wanna go?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Come on, killer, let's go.
- See you, Butchey.
- Yeah. Take it easy.
Good night, Eddie.
Disgusting!
Why do you think we spend so
much time in this stinking place?
Must be my egg creams.
I guess so.
Do you mind if I stick my two
cents worth in where it don't belong?
Can I stop you?
You don't mind me butting in?
As long as you don't come here
and give me a big kiss...
...anything goes.
That's what I mean.
- What?
- You're a wise guy.
Me?
I ain't no genius, but I'm smarter
than you because you're a schmuck.
Is that it? Are you finished?
No, I'm not.
You're a schmuck
because you got brains.
Not a lot.
But you got brains
and you're wasting them.
Don't stop. You're just getting
hot. I ought to take notes.
- All right, forget it.
- Don't forget it.
I'm gonna go home tonight...
...and I'm going to paint you
a masterpiece.
Know what I think? I think that this little
talk tonight has done me a world of good.
Get the hell out of here.
I'm gonna do something
wonderful with my life!
And I owe it all to you.
Good night.
Stop it.
Trust me?
Don't cry.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Tell me.
What's the matter?
Don't you like us together?
That's not it.
Then tell me.
What is it?
I don't know!
Tell me!
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Yeah, well, I wanna talk about it.
Did I hurt you or something?
Come on, tell me what it is!
I wanna talk about it.
You're so beautiful.
Come on.
Look, I don't want to be
just another...
What?
- I don't want to be that.
- What?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I want to talk about it! Tell me!
Look, I just don't want to be...
...just another...
I don't want that.
I know.
Until I met you, I didn't think
it was possible either.
I never seen a broad get so
upset at a movie before.
Hey, Butchey!
Chico?
Shut up, man.
My parents are sleeping.
Can I come up?
- Go around the side.
- What?
Go around the side.
What'd you do tonight?
What'd you do tonight?
I took Jane to the drive-in.
How far did you get?
Do you wanna help me dump the car?
Come on, help me dump the car, okay?
Man, it is late.
Tomorrow.
What are you pissed off about?
Who's pissed off?
I'm not pissed off.
What's with you, man?
Nothing.
Jane.
You wanna talk about it?
Well, there isn't...
There isn't much to say.
I mean, what can I say?
If you got nothing to say,
I can go to sleep.
Well, here they are.
Here's the happy couple.
Congratulations.
Yeah, thanks.
We came for it.
Let me get it.
You know, all my life
I wanted to be engaged.
You know something, Stanley? You got
the best girl in all of Brooklyn.
- Yeah, I know.
- You do.
Look at that ring.
Couldn't you just picture
that on her finger?
Isn't this a beauty?
Here, let me try it on.
I want you to know something
about this ring.
It's an investment in the future.
Oh, Stanley, isn't it beautiful?
This is the ring I wanted all my life.
They grow more valuable in time.
Wait a minute, Annie.
Tell me something about this ring.
It's a one-and-a-half-carat marquise...
...in a platinum setting...
...with two baguettes.
It's a beauty.
Tell me about "it."
Oh, $1600.
Sixteen.
You got something else?
About the same size.
Do you have something like that?
Well, I'll try.
Let's get out of here.
We could do it on the layaway plan.
- You can even have it on consignment.
- I don't want nothing on consignment.
Go outside and run your
teeth on the curb.
- Very funny.
- Don't talk to her like that!
Do you think
she's one of the boys?
Wanna put that in writing?
She's my best friend, and she's
gonna be my maid of honour.
That's right, Stanley.
Who ever heard of a maid of honour
riding in on a broom, huh?
I want that ring, Stanley.
I got a ring for you, Fran.
I got a ring for you.
Around my bathtub.
Christ!
Tell me again. How much is it?
- How much is that ring?
- The other ring?
This...
The ring she has here.
This ring is $1600.
It's marked down from $2200
and it's a steal.
It's a beautiful ring.
I don't want the ring, Stanley!
I don't want it! I don't want it!
Will you listen to me?
Calm down a minute.
Listen to me.
I'll get you an I.D. Bracelet
or something.
- You cheapskate!
- You are so cheap, Stanley.
Hey, Meatball, why don't you go
wire your hair?
I'm saving for a car.
You're saving for a car?
All you ever think of
is money, money, money.
I don't think I'm gonna
let you marry my girlfriend.
Annie, shut up!
Listen to me, daddy-o.
Listen to me.
You got one of those rings you
take out for 10 days...?
I don't want it for 10 days!
I want it forever.
It's a 10-day ring.
Do you have one?
I love you.
Buy me that ring!
All right, how much you want?
I'll take 10%. It's $160...
No, I only have 90.
You bought a ring.
I can't believe it!
Stanley, we're engaged!
It's so beautiful.
Wait a minute.
Will you shut up a minute?
Take the ring...
Take the ring outside...
...and look at it in the dark
or something, will you?
Take the ring out. See if it
cuts glass or something.
I don't believe it!
Isn't it beautiful?
It's so gorgeous.
Just look at the colour.
It's a beautiful ring.
Listen to me.
Listen to me, daddy-o.
See that girl just walked out?
You ever show her a $1600 ring again...
...know what's gonna be
on your tombstone?
You know what's gonna be written?
"I was dumb enough to show
Frannie Malincanico...
...a $1600 ring."
Know what I mean?
You'll look fabulous.
It's just so gorgeous.
You're so lucky!
Did I do it? Did I do it?
- It's the happiest day of my life.
- Yeah, I know.
It's the happiest day
of my life too.
- Who's the best guy in the world?
- You are!
You're engaged?
Better you than me!
- Is it real?
- Of course it's real!
Stanley paid real money for it.
Let me kiss the bride.
Congratulations.
It'll be fun.
I like your friends.
They're all right.
- They like you too.
- Yeah, I noticed.
Oh, well, see you later.
See you later.
I'd be so much happier if you
were getting married too.
That's what I always counted on.
That's why I was so happy for you.
I always wanted a double wedding.
I know, Annie. But don't worry.
Listen, Stanley has
a cousin in New Jersey.
Really, he's gorgeous.
Father owns a pizza place.
I promise I'll fix you up
with him. Don't worry.
Hey, my man, Chico!
There's Chico.
You know what?
Stanley just got engaged!
Congratulate him.
Come on, go ahead.
Go talk to him.
Congratulations, really.
Are you interested in
a little fun, man?
- Not now!
- I have to talk...
Not now!
Listen, Butch, you interested in
a little entertainment?
What kind?
Like punching somebody's face?
- Who's face?
- Arnie Levine, that's who, man.
Stanley? What about you?
You gotta do it today?
I need it right now, man.
I need you.
Where is he?
You are not going!
You promised me!
Who you pulling, huh?
I wanna tell you something.
Never tell me what to do and
what not to do. You understand me?
Do you?
Those guys have been asking for it!
Hey, calm down.
Let's go!
Come back!
You have your Sunday clothes on!
Arnie Levine!
Get your ass out here!
You homo fairies dancing in there?
Arnie, some guys out here want you.
This time you're gonna lose
your balls for real.
Get out here, you scumbag!
- Who wants me?
- I do, Levine!
All right, get back to work.
- What do you want?
- You.
Butchey!
Hey, Butchey. You okay, man?
Hey, Stanley.
My leg!
I think it's broken.
Come here. Come here.
What happened to your foot?
Don't scratch.
That's a pretty girl.
If you eat your food, you know
what'll happen to you?
You'll grow up to be a bald eagle.
You wanna be a bald eagle?
Or do you want to be a squirt?
What do you wanna be, huh?
Rocky Marciano, how are you?
- What you doing?
- Not much. I saw Butchey.
How is he?
He's all right.
You gonna go and see him?
I don't fit in well with hospitals.
I'm afraid of the whole thing.
I don't like it.
- How you feeling?
- I can't complain.
I hurt my neck a little bit in
the fight. Nothing serious, but...
You mind if I come up?
Come on up, but watch yourself
right here.
It's a little tricky.
A little tricky.
That's it. You got it.
Good boy!
I've been thinking about
getting some chickens.
- What for?
- I'm thinking about raising chickens.
I figure this way.
Rhode Island chickens, right?
They lay good eggs.
I'll sell the eggs
in the neighbourhood and when...
...the chickens get too fat,
I'll eat them.
You could support your family.
- She ain't pregnant.
- She ain't?
- You don't have to marry her.
- No, I don't have to marry her.
But I might.
You know, I might.
You know what you really
gotta have to raise pigeons?
You know what you gotta have?
What they call...
..."country blood."
- Like you got.
- I got country blood.
When you're out there screwing
around on your motorcycle...
...you know what I do?
I come up here,
I sit in my coop and I read.
You read, man?
What do you read?
Maps.
- What have maps got to do with anything?
- A lot.
I figure it this way.
The more maps you read, the more
you know about where you wanna go.
You pick a place, okay?
Any place in this whole world,
and I'll show you ain't so smart.
All right. Tokyo.
Tokyo. Good spot.
Here's what we do.
First, pretend you're a pigeon.
Look that way and close your eyes.
Go on.
Pretend you're flying and flying.
Going farther...
...farther and farther out.
Now, right here...
...you look down. Look down, Chico.
Do you see what's down there?
Look, look.
Yeah, man. I see what's down there.
I see pigeon shit.
Come on, man. Listen to me!
Do you want to do it or not?
You're a pigeon, okay?
Shut your eyes. Come on.
Watch me.
You're going and you're flying.
Over mountains, over the ocean.
And your arms are getting tired.
Now, right here...
...Iook down, man. Look down.
Do you see what's down there?
Chinks. Chinks. Do you know
what that means, man? Chinks.
You're in Tokyo. We're in Tokyo.
We're not in Tokyo.
We're on the roof!
We're on the roof. Don't you see?
We're not in Tokyo.
I'm in Tokyo.
What's it look like?
What's it smell like in Tokyo?
What's the matter?
- Your bike broke?
- That's the point.
That's the whole point.
I got a bike.
I can go places, man.
That's the whole thing.
I don't need a bike to go anyplace.
To go places, to really go places,
you gotta have imagination.
No, man! You can have all
the imagination you want!
You're never gonna see
no Chinks in Tokyo.
That's a lie!
You don't know what I do.
If I say I've been to Tokyo,
I've been to Tokyo.
I'll tell you something else.
I don't like you telling
me what I can do and what I can't do.
Because I see right through you!
You stand in pigeon shit,
you're gonna be pigeon shit.
You got that?
You're gonna be pigeon shit.
I'm gonna forget that, Chico!
You know why?
Because if I don't forget that,
you're gonna be a memory!
You're gonna be a memory.
You hear me, Chico?
You're gonna be a memory!
What do you want?
What's wrong?
I'll be right down, Fran.
Wait a minute, will you?
I want to talk to you.
I just wanna talk to you for
a few minutes. Come on, wait.
I have to go home. I'm late.
You can't go
until you talk to me.
All right! What do you
wanna talk about?
You did something to me.
And I just wanted you to know.
- I know what you're talking about.
- No, you don't know.
Just let me tell you
what I'm talking about.
We had something between us
that was...
...better than anything...
- I'm sorry if I hurt you.
I didn't say I got hurt.
I'm not talking about getting hurt.
I don't care.
I just wanna tell you...
Look, Chico,
just can't we be friends?
Can't we just be friends?
Fine.
- Fine.
- You're so immature.
I like you a lot.
And we had a good time, all right?
I'm glad we had a good time.
We'll have to do it again.
I just don't understand you,
that's all.
That's okay. I guess I'm
pretty tough to understand.
What you think
is important, I don't.
- What I think is important, you don't.
- I guess so.
When are you gonna grow up?
I guess, never.
I did it, didn't I?
You got a nice little girl there.
Be good to her, huh?
I will, Pop.
- It's important.
- I will.
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please...
...before we all settle down
to a hearty meal!
I want you all to join in a toast...
...to the bride...
...and the groom!
- Where's your best man?
- Who?
Wimpy! Wimpy!
Toast.
I just wanna wish you well.
Both of you.
I want you to have a good life.
Be happy.
Salute!
