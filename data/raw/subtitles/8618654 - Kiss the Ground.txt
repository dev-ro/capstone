Planet Earth,
home to a growing number of Homo sapiens
and a whole lot of other creatures.
It's a great place to live.
When it comes
to the future of our small planet…
Now to a dire warning
about climate change.
Natural disasters
like hurricanes or wildfires…
An unprecedented decline
in nature threatening humanity.
Sixth mass extinction event
is already well underway…
There's so much bad news
about our planet, it's overwhelming.
The fear that we're headed for a cliff
puts most of us into a state of paralysis.
The truth is…
I've given up.
And the odds are so have you.
But what if there was another path?
This is the story of a simple solution,
a way to heal our planet
and keep our species
off the extinction list.
In fact, the solution
I'm talking about is right under our feet,
and it's as old as dirt.
We call it soil, earth, or ground.
And due to its vast scale,
and its ability to sequester
immense quantities of greenhouse gases,
it could just be the one thing
that can balance our climate,
replenish our fresh water supplies,
and feed the world.
That's why some people
are racing to save our soil
in hopes our soil just might…
save us.
I am a conservation agronomist.
I have been in every state,
all the way from Alaska,
to Puerto Rico, to Hawaii.
I've also been asked
to go speak in Europe, Australia…
I just haven't had the time.
If we get the soil right,
we can fix a lot of our issues.
Healthy soils lead to a healthy plant.
Healthy plant, healthy animal,
healthy human,
healthy water, healthy climate.
This is what this is about today.
Learning how the soil works
and learning how to farm like nature does.
I have learned my job is to drop a seed.
And the more you farm like nature,
the more we can reduce your inputs,
and the more money you can make.
It's my calling. Just as simple as that.
Actually, this is one…
I've lived in four or five states.
Everywhere I go and work,
we're still having the same problem.
Massive erosion.
Erosion is when soil becomes dirt.
Rapid erosion began long ago
when humans developed the plow.
Its purpose was to break the soil
in order to sow seeds.
By the Bronze Age,
vast areas around cities
were plowed up to plant grains.
But as their soils eroded,
those once-great empires
vanished into dust.
But we don't have
to look back thousands of years
to see the dangers of erosion.
In the 1930s,
America experienced the largest
man-made environmental disaster
in history.
It was called the Dust Bowl.
It was largely caused by farmers
tilling the once-fertile Midwestern Plains
and leaving the soil exposed.
By the end of 1934,
roughly 200 million acres of cropland
were permanently damaged.
On a whistle stop train tour,
President Franklin D. Roosevelt saw
the destruction
of America's soil firsthand.
In response,
he created the Soil Conservation Service
to save the nation's soil.
What I have seen confirms me
in the belief
that I've had for a long time…
that we're going to win on this problem.
It relates to working out
a plan of cooperation with nature
instead of going along
with what we've been doing in the past
trying to buck nature.
The practice of plowing
and tilling the soil
continues to this day.
But so does Franklin D. Roosevelt's
Soil Conservation Service.
It was made part
of the US Department of Agriculture,
and it's now called the Natural
Resources Conservation Service,
the NRCS.
We want the water
to leave through a living plant.
Today, the NRC
has field agents, like Ray,
trying to teach farmers
to reduce tilling…
Microbes live in there,
and that's called the porous sphere.
…And reduce the spraying
of industrial chemicals
that damage the soil.
Tillage is one of the most
intrusive things we do
in modern agriculture.
It is not our friend.
The message is simple,
but getting that message out…
is difficult.
We have a social problem.
We have an education issue.
And until we get that right,
we can't fix our ecological issues.
I have been in NRCS for 31 years.
It's kind of amazing to me
as I was teaching all over the country.
I'm going, wow, our producers
don't really know how the soil works.
They don't understand
the basic ecological principles.
Everything runs by carbon.
We're built by carbon.
The soil microbes run by carbon.
Carbon is the driving engine.
It runs the system.
But when it comes
to the role of carbon in our world,
there's… a bit of confusion.
To be specific, carbon dioxide is a gas.
We breathe it out,
and plants breathe it in.
We also make carbon dioxide
by burning fossil fuels.
But carbon isn't bad.
In fact,
it's the basis for all life on Earth.
There's a tendency right now
for us to be at war with carbon.
Carbon's the bad guy.
And I think this is a lost opportunity.
Carbon's the good guy.
We're carbon.
I'm-I'm 16 percent carbon,
and all of it came from eating vegetation
and things that eat vegetation.
Plants use sunlight as energy,
and they pull carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere,
they turn it into a carbon fuel,
and that's how they grow.
But 40 percent of that carbon fuel,
they send down to their roots.
They're leaking it out in a very
strategic way to soil microorganisms.
Plants are feeding
soil microorganisms carbon,
and the soil microorganisms
are bringing plants mineral nutrients.
And in the process of all that,
those soil microorganisms make
a carbon glue out of that carbon fuel.
And they make habitat in the soil.
They make little pockets in the soil
to control the flow of air and water.
And that's one of the ways
that carbon gets fixed in the soil.
In other words,
soil has the unique ability
to sequester carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere.
That's a big deal.
And what's even more amazing:
the soil contains
an entire universe of life.
Here, I went to years of college,
and I took soil science. I didn't know.
I really did not know how the soil worked.
It's alive.
In every handful of healthy soil,
there more organisms than the number
of people who've ever lived
on planet Earth.
♪ I believe in miracles ♪
♪ Where you from ♪
- ♪ You sexy thing ♪
- ♪ Sexy thing, you… ♪
And those organisms
are processing organic matter
that's in the soil
and putting the nutrients
into a form that the plant needs.
Comparing the soil microbial diversity
to the microbial diversity we're now
seeing inside the human organism,
you have more bacterial cells
in your body than you have human cells.
Yeah, we're about one percent human
and 99 percent microbes.
It's the truth.
The food that we eat,
we actually chew and break
that food material down into little bits
that get eaten by the bacteria in our gut.
When you eat kale,
let's say,
when you're eating kale,
your body doesn't consume kale.
The bacteria consumed the kale.
And you feed off of what the bacteria
have processed and released
by the consumption of that kale.
The key to health is eating dirt.
What I mean by that
is we need to eat what's in the dirt
that's transferred to the plants,
that then we eat and create health.
You know,
my husband is an athlete for a living,
so he wants to provide his body
with the best possible nutrients
so he can perform.
I beat my body down so much
over the course of the season,
the last thing I want to do
is add a bunch of food
that I won't be able to properly digest,
that won't be the kind of nutrition
that I need
in order to repair and regenerate
my body the way that it needs to be.
And, of course,
the quality of the soil is huge
because it is the beginning
of the quality of the food.
That quality of food
provides quality health.
It all comes from the Earth. Big Mama.
Our health and the health
of our planet are connected.
If we choose healthy food,
there is a reciprocation.
Not only we feel better, we are healthier,
but the Earth is healthier.
Taking care of the microbes
in the soil is critical for human health.
But spraying the soil
with toxic chemicals,
well, does something else.
All of our soils that are under
chemical conventional agriculture
are almost completely devoid
of microorganisms.
Spraying the soil
with toxic chemicals
kills the very microbes we need
to give us health,
and pull the carbon from the atmosphere.
The more tilling that's done,
the weaker the soil gets,
and the more farmers feel compelled
to use chemical sprays.
This is the vicious cycle
of industrial agriculture.
And that cycle
was developed as a result of war.
The roots of industrial agriculture
go back to a German scientist
named Fritz Haber.
Haber invented a process
for making synthetic nitrogen fertilizer
that increased food production.
His other scientific breakthrough
was the creation of poisons
known as pesticides.
Haber used his pesticides
as the first chemical weapons in history.
Then he developed the poison
used in the gas chambers of the Holocaust.
When the war ended,
US chemical companies
brought Haber's poisons back to America
and rebranded
his toxic chemicals as pesticides
for American farms.
Dow set out to demonstrate
the effectiveness of its chemical killers
on a nationwide scale.
When the war ended,
all the energy that went
into fighting the enemies in the world…
went into fighting
the enemies on the farm.
All of a sudden,
chemical fertilizer nitrogen
was available,
and farmers could toss that on a field.
Even if they hadn't
taken care of their soil,
they could get a good crop for a while.
Together, these wartime innovations
created the most powerful
industrial food production system
the world had ever seen.
We created an infrastructure
around single types of industry,
and then we decoupled livestock
and row crop production.
We found people
who are really good at raising livestock,
and you found people
who were really good at growing row crops,
and you split those two camps.
That ushered
in this big philosophical shift
in terms of how we approached farming.
Instead of understanding
and honoring natural processes,
we could just throw out these chemicals.
We just throw out more and more of them.
It kept going up and up and up.
It takes more nitrogen now
to raise a bushel of grain
than it did in 1960.
Our chemical fertilizers
mask the problem of degraded soils.
Modern agriculture was not designed
for the betterment of the soil.
Today, our most common crops
are genetically altered
to resist the spraying
of toxic pesticides.
For example, the number one crop
in the United States, field corn,
is almost entirely sprayed
with glyphosate,
a chemical suspected
to cause cancer that's so over sprayed,
it's found its way
into our drinking water.
These chemicals,
which were considered dangerous
to begin with,
are now being used at rates
that would have been inconceivable
twenty years ago.
Every year,
for every American alive,
three pounds of toxic chemicals
are sprayed onto the food
grown on our farms.
That goes into the soil.
It goes into the water.
It goes into our bodies.
It's not just on the food you eat.
It's everywhere.
Most of the agricultural
industries' pesticides and herbicides
transfer directly through breast milk
to babies.
There are over 200 peer-reviewed studies
that correlate the spraying
of these toxic chemicals
to effects like ADD in children,
pediatric cancers, and birth defects.
That's why juries have begun
to award billions of dollars in damages
to people who contracted cancer
after using glyphosate.
We know, for example, that glyphosate,
which is also known as Roundup,
has an effect on the gut microbiome
that may lead to disturbances
that can create disease,
including cancer.
A big reason these chemicals make us sick
is because just as toxic chemicals
kill the microbes in the soil,
they also kill the microbes in our bodies.
What I tell people is,
your body can handle acute stresses,
but it cannot handle chronic stresses.
The soil ecosystem is the same way.
If you keep dumping the fungicides,
you keep dumping the herbicide,
you keep dumping the insecticide,
you keep doing the tillage…
chronic stress.
It doesn't function anymore.
Since chemical agriculture
ramped up worldwide in the 1970s,
we have lost one third
of the Earth's topsoil.
But industrial agriculture
isn't just harming our soils.
It's also affecting something much larger.
The most massive tsunami,
perfect storm, is bearing down upon us.
But fossil fuels…
carbon, coal, and gas…
are by no means the only thing
that is causing climate change.
Now, because the fate of water and carbon
are tied to soil organic matter,
when we damage soils, you give off carbon.
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.
Healthy soils
absorb water and carbon dioxide.
But when we destroy soil,
it releases water and carbon dioxide.
This dries out the soil
and turns it into dust.
The process is called desertification.
And how we deal with it
could determine the fate
of more than just our climate.
Desertification is a fancy word
for land that is turning to desert,
and this happens
only when we create too much bare ground.
Soil and the plant
and the climate are connected.
If you don't have a living plant,
you're going to have more evaporation.
What we want is transpiration,
when the moisture leaves
through the plant.
When it does that, it increases humidity.
And when it increases the humidity,
we have more rain.
Sixty percent of our rainfall
comes from the ocean.
But a lot of people don't realize
40 percent comes from small water cycles
where our rain comes from inland.
What's going on
is we disrupted the small water cycles.
That's when you have too much
sensible heat coming off bare soil.
You're having
these huge vortexes of hot air going out.
Instead of attracting the rain,
it's pushing the rain clouds away.
Take one square meter of soil
and make it bare,
and I promise you,
you will find it much colder at dawn
and much hotter at mid-day
than that same piece of ground
if it's just covered with plant litter.
You have changed the microclimate.
Now, by the time you're doing that…
on more than half the world's land…
you are changing macroclimate.
Desertification of our soils
is a pressing threat to our climate
and our species.
But I have for you a very simple message.
About two-thirds
of the world is desertifying.
As soils turn to dust around the world,
every year, 40 million people
are pushed off their land.
By 2050,
it's estimated that one billion people
will be refugees of soil desertification.
More than 20 civilizations,
in all regions of the world, have failed
because of agriculture
damaging the environment.
Their communities could not handle
the deteriorating environment
and the rising population.
Globally, that's what we're doing today.
Poor land leads to poor people.
Poor people leads to social breakdown.
Poor land leads to increasing frequency
of floods and droughts,
and mass immigration
across borders and into cities.
And it's leading
to ideal recruitment conditions.
What we know right now
is the way we're feeding ourselves
is undermining the very ecology
that we're dependent upon.
So the long-term prognosis
for our survival on this planet,
given business as usual,
is very, very poor.
According to the United Nations,
the world's remaining topsoil
will be gone within 60 years.
In other words,
unless we find a way to save our soils,
we have 60 harvests left.
The global scale of the problems we face
may seem insurmountable.
But in every fight that seems unwinnable,
there are those who refuse to give up.
Oh, let's see. Let's do that.
We'll do a couple of demos.
We're very fortunate
to have Ray Archuleta with us today.
Ray, as you can tell, is someone
that has quite a bit of notoriety.
He's got his own--
He's got his own reality show. Now, that--
With that,
I'm gonna turn the floor over to Ray,
and, Ray, we appreciate you being here.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, Ray.
This is a supercomputer model by NASA.
We're concerned
of the red and purples being CO2.
I want you to notice the dates.
That is February.
March.
Now, what are we doing March? April?
What do we do
in modern agriculture in April?
We are tilling.
We're tilling the land.
And look at the huge plumes of CO2.
Look at the dates.
May.
Now, let's see what happens around June.
Look at the colors change.
Ladies and gentlemen,
what is happening in June?
Do you see how powerful
the living plants are?
Can you imagine
if we had all our rangeland
and all our cropland covered?
A covered planet is a healthy planet.
We can fix a lot of our climate issues
if we bring the CO2 down
into a living plant
and put it back into the soil
where it belongs.
Agriculture is the biggest way
that humans impact our landscape.
We have unleashed, through agriculture,
over the centuries, over the millennia,
carbon from the land,
and it's now up in the atmosphere.
It's now part
of that legacy load of carbon dioxide.
Many people are coming
to this discussion about soil health
because it can bring that carbon back down
and put it in the ground.
First, he's an environmentalist
and the editor of Drawdown,
the most comprehensive plan
ever proposed to reverse global warming.
Please welcome Paul Hawken.
Tell us why your plan is different
and why it is the most comprehensive.
Well, it's very different
because it's the first one ever.
Wow.
You cannot achieve drawdown
without bio sequestration.
Bio sequestration
is using plants, trees, perennials,
and techniques of grazing and farming
to capture carbon
and store it in the sink of the soil,
and retain it for decades,
if not centuries.
What we did is mapped,
measured, and modeled
the hundred most substantive solutions
to global warming.
And what I mean by solutions,
I mean things that are at hand.
We know how to do it. There's scaling.
And if we continue to scale in a rigorous,
but reasonable way, over 30 years,
we can reverse global warming.
When you talk to people
about this great technology
that has existed for millions of years
that takes carbon out of the atmosphere
and stores it safely in the soil,
and that it's called plants
working with soil microorganisms,
it seems too simple.
Putting our atmospheric carbon
down into our soil may be a simple idea,
but to do it on a global scale requires…
politics.
And when it comes
to the politics of climate change,
well, let's just say…
there's a lot of hot air.
In 2015, the United Nations
held a climate summit in Paris.
It was called COP 21.
Forty thousand delegates
from 196 countries from all over the world
met to reach an agreement
on how to address climate change.
There were presentations and meetings
and speeches, and speeches,
and speeches.
My name is Bunkin.
Please touch my screen.
And there was one proposal
that offered real hope,
and it was presented by this guy.
I come from a village
in the region called "La Sarthe,"
a small village, with a population of 256
who were involved
in the world of rural farming.
There were lots of farmers.
So I was interested in farming
very early in life.
France maintains the largest
agricultural science institution
in Europe.
It's called INRA,
and it's been studying soil
for over a hundred years.
INRA recently developed a program
called the Four for 1000 Initiative.
Their goal is to increase
the carbon content of the world's soils
by .4 percent annually.
That would sequester
the same amount of carbon
that humanity emits each year.
The soil environment
can hold more carbon
than the atmosphere and plants living
on the surface of the soil combined.
We have an incredible ability to be able
to store that carbon in the soil
in a relatively short period of time.
The primary tool of farming is the soil.
It's not the tractor.
It's not the combine-harvester.
It's not the satellite. It's the soil.
What's really at stake here
is what happens after COP 21 in Paris.
If all people here
can become aware of the role of the soil,
and if people can get that the soil
can be loaded up with carbon,
and then after that,
we must all take action
to achieve these objectives.
At a side meeting at COP 21,
Monsieur Le Foll,
the French Minister of Agriculture,
presented an idea
that just might change the world.
Ladies, gentlemen, and dear colleagues,
with all the farmland, but also,
with all the soils of the forests,
we have an enormous potential.
The fact that we are able
to implement an actual answer
to the struggle against climate change,
an answer that could equal
the same amount
as the amount of carbon
humanity emits each year.
That's colossal.
Four parts per thousand
is the capacity all of us have together
to be able to succeed.
Thank you.
At the Four for 1000 event,
many countries signed
Stéphane Le Foll's pledge
to draw carbon down into their soils.
Thirty countries from around
the world signing on to, what I believe,
is going to be one of the most
significant changes in agriculture.
Because to achieve this Four for 1000,
we have to change
the way we do agriculture.
And doing agriculture
in a way that sequesters carbon
requires a radical reduction
in toxic pesticides,
GMOs, and synthetic chemicals.
But the three largest contributors
to carbon dioxide
and the three largest agricultural
producers were missing from the agreement.
India, the United States, and China
did not show.
Does it frustrate you that
America did not sign on to the agreement?
Yes, it's frustrating.
Because this is the first time
an entire country, France,
yes, a smaller country than the US,
but a big agricultural country,
has proposed a global
and political initiative
that links together
the fight against global warming
with changing the way we farm.
But when it comes to the US,
they're not there yet.
And after all that,
the United States announced
that it had pulled
entirely out of the Paris Agreement.
If we are going to succeed
in balancing our climate,
we do need to switch
to renewable energies.
But none of that will alter
the tremendous amount of carbon
we've already put into the atmosphere.
Since 1750,
when the Industrial Revolution began,
we've pumped about 1,000 billion tons,
also known as gigatons,
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
It's called our legacy load of carbon.
And even if we stopped
all greenhouse gas emissions today,
that legacy load of carbon
will still be there.
That legacy load of carbon dioxide
is still gonna be warming the atmosphere
for decades, if not centuries.
So if all we talk about
is reducing emissions,
it's not enough.
If electric cars
and solar panels aren't enough,
then what is the solution?
The only goal that makes sense
for humanity is drawdown,
a year-to-year reduction in carbon
in the upper atmosphere.
Anything else is climate chaos.
If we want to achieve drawdown,
we have to go thank the Earth
and start to farm
and grow our plants and trees
in an entirely different way.
Once you achieve drawdown,
within 20 years, you have cooling.
You have the beginning of cooling.
So, now, we have a horizon
that if you're 20, 30 years old,
you can say,
"In my lifetime, we can achieve this."
In other words,
the very practices that heal our soils
will also heal our climate.
To stabilize Earth's climate,
we can use the most powerful
carbon capture technologies:
the photosynthesis of plants
and the microorganisms in the soil.
And the one type of farming
that does this the best
and draws down the most carbon
is based on the concept of regeneration,
which simply means
to repair the damage we've done
and make things better.
So we are sitting in a food forest.
This is agroforestry.
It's agriculture through trees,
tree diversification.
I've got an avocado tree,
banana tree, fig tree, coffee trees.
♪ …And put my hands in the dirt… ♪
We went from a lot of crop
of single Hass avocado
to now having
about 40 different fruit varieties onsite.
♪ 'Cause my home is where
My food is grown ♪
♪ I'm goin' back to the earth… ♪
By diversifying, we can now have harvests
every month.
If you're looking to do something
that would greatly impact Mother Earth,
plant a tree.
You don't need acres and acres
and acres to build a food forest.
You really just need
a few hundred square feet.
You're gonna look outside
one day ago and go,
"What is something we buy
every day at the grocery store,
that instead of waiting for it
to be shipped around the world to me,
what can I put in my own backyard
that I can do myself?"
♪ And to truly be forgiven
We must all get back to livin' ♪
♪ With the land in harmony ♪
♪ I'm goin' back to the earth ♪
♪ I'm goin' back… ♪
Regenerative agriculture
grows more food
per acre.
It's scalable
to our entire agricultural system.
And what's more,
it's already being done right now, today.
I'm a rancher.
That's how I prefer to be thought of
is I'm a rancher.
A farmer technically grows crops.
A rancher raises livestock.
Why I like to be considered a rancher
is because…
I'm all about living things
and taking part in living ecosystems.
And, to me, that's what my operation
- a living ecosystem.
We purchased this place in 1991.
And for the first two years,
I was farming conventionally.
Heavy, heavy tillage.
High use of synthetics.
1995 came along,
and the day
before I was going to start combining,
I lost 100 percent of our crop
to a hail storm.
So we were totally wiped out.
No income from our crops.
That was really tough to take
'cause we didn't have crop insurance.
1996 came along,
we lost 100 percent
of our crop to hail, again.
1997 came along…
we dried out.
Nobody combined an acre.
There was a major drought in this area.
1998 came along, and we lost
80 percent of our crop to hail.
So we were four years
with basically no crop income.
The neighbors were all taking bets
and waiting for my land.
Times were really
getting tough financially,
and the banker didn't want to loan me
any money to buy inputs.
The best thing that could have happened.
I wasn't gonna fail.
I really had to start focusing,
how can I make this farm and ranch
get these soils to produce a crop
without all these inputs?
So I started to be
a studier of soil ecosystems.
I actually went back
and I read Thomas Jefferson's old journals
'cause I was trying to figure out
how did they do this
previous to the use
of all these synthetics.
We have been promoting no till
for many, many years.
No tillage means
you don't till the soil at all.
You just plant directly into it.
This is a no-till drill.
No-till drills are available
everywhere in the world.
This will help you grow topsoil.
Any type of tillage equipment
will destroy topsoil.
This is your firming wheel.
This holds this residue
so the disc here can cut it,
just making a small slit.
The seed travels down
at a specific rate per acre.
This comes around,
moves a small amount of soil
right over that seed.
We're keeping all this armor
on the soil surface
in order to protect the soil
from wind erosion, water erosion,
so we can grow crops on much less moisture
with this type of a system.
Rain falls on this,
it's going to go right into the soil.
Rain falls on bare soil,
it's going to run off,
and then
it's going to evaporate very quickly.
Soil that is not tilled stores more water,
thus increasing microbe growth,
which leads to more plant growth
and even to more local rainfall.
This is the virtuous cycle
of regeneration.
Gabe Brown's soil is also pulling
more carbon out of the atmosphere.
For every one percent increase
in organic matter,
an acre of soil draws down
ten more tons of carbon.
I mean, that's huge.
We have to reduce tillage.
We gotta grow cover crops.
We have to get a living root all the time.
We can't have these bare periods
with nothing growing on them.
We've gotta start using these principles
to restore the water cycle.
And it is fixable.
So I'm taking you to a field here
that is a multi-species cover crop.
The purpose of a cover crop
is to enhance the life
and the function of the soil.
Think of it this way.
If I draw a monoculture on this field,
we'd only be feeding
the soil biology one type of root exudate.
I'm growing 19 species here.
We're accelerating biological time.
We're feeding the soil biology
what it would take
a conventional farmer 19 years to do.
I'm doing it in one year.
So people might ask,
"How do you get any money from this then?"
Our livestock will graze this
during the winter,
speeding up the process
of regenerating those soils.
Animals grazing living plants
are a part of the carbon cycle.
Here in the Northern Plains,
our soils were formed
by large herds of bison and elk
being moved by predators,
grazing a landscape,
trampling that carbon,
the plants, onto the soil surface.
Not coming back for maybe a year.
Allowing full recovery.
It wasn't that long ago
that over 60 million buffalo
roamed the continent.
In an attempt to starve
the Native Americans,
the US military and the railroads
killed most of the buffalo.
By the time the culling ended,
only a few thousand
of the majestic animals remained.
Where buffalo once roamed,
industrial agriculture now grows
hundreds of millions of acres of crops
just to feed animals.
And those animals
are concentrated into feedlots.
In turn, feedlots produce
a tremendous amount of greenhouse gases.
A feedlot situation
has a positive amount
of greenhouse gases being emitted.
In a grazing situation, the data shows
that we actually get
greenhouse gases sequestered.
So in one situation, you get emissions,
and in the other situation,
you get sequestration.
The problem isn't the animal.
The problem is where the animals are at.
Cows can be good.
That is one
of the most controversial statements…
of mankind at this point.
Using cattle
and allowing them to roam and graze,
land grazing,
can literally revive enough space
to create a tremendous amount of drawdown.
I'm from Southeast Louisiana.
I grew up
in an incredibly delicate ecosystem.
Conservation was always
a very serious part of my life.
I had no idea
that the Earth was desertifying.
I got on a plane from New York City
to fly to Zimbabwe to meet Allan Savory
so he could show us
the difference between desertification
and regeneration.
Land that has been holistically managed
through planned grazing using cattle,
the most vilified animal in the world.
We are in Africa right now
driving through a field
that has been under Allan Savory's
holistic management for nine years,
and it is an Eden.
This is what you call high grass.
Using livestock to reverse desertification
is totally scalable
to about two-thirds of the world's land,
and nothing else is.
And, frankly, that can be done
at extremely low cost.
Here we are.
This is what it should be like.
You've been working
on this land for eight or nine years.
It went from a place
of turning into a total desert,
and using hooved herding herbivores.
You have literally transformed that,
what we've been seeing,
- into this.
- Yeah.
How in the hell do you make this happen?
So the urine and the hooves of the animals
are what caused this grass to grow.
That livestock is never on more
than a hectare of this land,
about 2.5 acres,
- never more than three days.
- Right.
And they're never back
on that piece of land
under about six to nine months.
- Wow.
- So no plant can get overgrazed.
You can come any day of the year,
anywhere on this land,
and you will see no livestock
because they will be
on less than one hectare of land.
And unless we take you there,
you won't even know it.
Dealing with this beast of climate change,
a lot of people don't understand
that this…
- helps climate change.
- Yes.
- This sequesters carbon.
- Yeah.
This takes the one thing that
we so desperately need out of the air,
and it holds it, and it makes oxygen.
Yeah, if we can produce solid grassland,
you can pull down enormous amounts
of carbon back into the soil.
Two-thirds of the world, roughly,
is grasslands in savannas
where the rainfall is too low
to support a solid canopy of trees
giving you soil cover.
So grass is essentially
what has to stabilize that soil.
You look at this, and you realize
this is what the world should look like.
This is what Africa should look like.
This is what South
and Central America should look like.
This is what Texas should look like.
This is how we win.
We can get the Earth
back to the garden of Eden
that it once was
by regeneration.
When used smartly,
herbivores can pull down carbon
and reverse desertification.
But it doesn't just work for Africa.
It works everywhere in the world.
So it's long pants today, right?
You guys are gonna ride horses?
Yeah.
Okay.
I was raised
in a rural area in Washington,
adopted by a Lakota elder.
We were out in nature every day.
I found permaculture,
and that was very influential in my life,
where I could see that
there could be a permanent agriculture…
an agriculture
that not only fed the planet,
but also fed the people
in a way that regenerated
and didn't deplete resources.
Holistic ranchers,
like the Markegards, use careful planning
so their cows sequester carbon
and actually regenerate the land.
So this is our grazing plan
and control chart.
This tells us where we're planning
to have the cattle when.
Hi!
Let's see. It's July 22nd,
so they were in G1,
and they are going to move here.
All these paddocks correlate
with a map that I have here.
So these are all segments of fencing
where the cattle are.
It tells me how big it is.
I can record observations, species,
all right in here in the field.
We manage over 8,000 acres
throughout the Bay Area,
so we're constantly on the move.
I never get bored.
I never get bored.
They call cows mobile microbe tanks,
you know, because cows
employ microbes in their rumen
to break down the fibers in food.
So when cows poop,
that is just like a steaming mound
of microbes dumped onto the land,
and it's-- it-it, you know,
it's a powerful stuff for the land.
So it's been about three months
since the cattle have been
in this pasture.
Did you hear that little pop
when I popped it out?
That was all these root hairs popping off.
There's just thousands
and thousands of feet of these root hairs
that are interconnected
with all of these other bunch grasses
and all of these other species
through their root hairs
and also through the mycorrhiza fungi.
The cattle will come along,
and they'll eat the tops off.
What happens
when the grasses get bitten off
is these roots slough off.
And what is that root made out of?
Carbon.
We're taking carbon from the atmosphere
via photosynthesis
into the plant,
and then it's going through the plant
into the root system,
that carbon, and it sloughs off
and turns into humus…
where it belongs.
The form of agriculture that we use
creates billions of lives
in the form of soil microbes,
in nematodes, in grassland birds.
All of that wildlife is flourishing
under an agriculture system
versus a tilled crop field,
which is denude of life.
In the vast majority
of those tilled fields grow one thing:
animal feed.
Corn, soy, and hay.
These crops and the feedlots
that rely on them exist
only because they are subsidized
by our tax dollars.
I was speaking to a group of corn
and soybean producers from Missouri
this past winter.
And the one guy stood up and said,
"Why would I want to plant
anything else than corn and beans
when I'm guaranteed a profit
before I even go on the field?"
The United States Department
of Agriculture uses something
called the Commodity Credit Corporation
to give farmers price guarantees
for growing specific crops.
In the current system,
taxpayers subsidize farmers
to grow the crops
that feed the animals
that live in feedlots,
which emit greenhouse gases.
The result?
Our land is turning to dust,
and our farmers are going bust.
And then I come back and ask them,
now, how much money would you be making
if the government
wasn't subsidizing your operation?
And they know. They know the answer.
They're not gonna be making money.
I dropped off all those programs.
I tell producers
I don't want to be on welfare anymore.
Even with genetically-altered seeds,
chemical sprays, and government subsidies,
most farmers struggle
to make a few dollars per acre.
But on its 5,000 acres,
Brown's ranch generates
over $100 profit per acre per year.
If you build a healthy farm ecosystem,
you're going to be resilient.
You're going to take the risk out of it.
Yes, I grow corn.
I don't grow soybeans, but I grow peas.
That's good.
But I also grow wheat,
and barley, and oats, vetch,
and triticale, and alfalfa,
grass-finished beef, lamb, pork,
honey, vegetables,
all these other products.
I could care less
what the price of corn or beans are
because they're such
a small fraction of my operation.
I built resiliency into the ecosystem.
Most of the land that's managed by farmers
is owned by somebody
other than the farmer.
We believe landowners,
as they come to understand
the long-term benefits
of managing for soil health,
will encourage their farmers
to prioritize this.
Once a farmer starts to manage
for soil health
and see those economic benefits,
they won't turn back.
By switching to regenerative agriculture,
American farmers
could increase their profits
by over 100 billion dollars annually,
and virtually eliminate their subsidies.
You know,
we have a motto on our operation.
We want to sign
the back of the check and not the front.
It's a pretty good motto.
It leaves a lot more in your pocket.
The federal farm program we have today
is the most detrimental thing there is
to regenerative agriculture.
In order for our governments
to support the shift to regeneration,
the people may have to lead the way.
And the odds are
there are some things that you can do
to save our soils today.
This is everybody's life
every hour of the day almost.
Food waste.
Yeah, food waste is ubiquitous.
Everybody does it.
Well, not everybody does it.
There are continents and other really
large regions that are getting hit
with a double whammy
of higher temperatures and drought.
This kills soil. It kills life.
One of the solutions to that challenge
is to collect the food scraps
from cities, like San Francisco,
turn them into compost,
and get it onto local farms.
And that helps them retain water
because compost is a natural sponge.
The unfortunate reality is
most trash or garbage gets incinerated
or sent to a landfill.
We need to model nature.
I had the good fortune of being mayor
when we brought the United Nations
World Environment Day into our city.
We made it a week-long celebration
of the environment and a call to action.
And one of the specific strategies
was reducing waste.
San Francisco residents are actually fined
for not putting compost
into the green bin.
We incentivize people
to keep things out of the black bins.
When you have nothing
in a black bin, we don't charge you.
When you have a ton of stuff
in the black bin, we charge you a lot.
So your goal
is to get it in the green and blue bins,
the composting and the recycling bins.
You want to move the mouse,
gotta move the cheese.
In San Francisco,
we're collecting 700 tons of food scraps
and plant cuttings per day.
It's 5:00 in the morning…
and we're making compost.
This is the most important kind
of garbage that there is
because this is where the nutrients are,
and this is where the carbon is.
The compost arrives,
the food scraps from the restaurants
and people's homes,
and we put them in this sorting system.
Sixty days ago,
this was egg shells, and chicken bones,
and vegetable peelings.
And, now,
it's a beautiful finished compost.
And I'm digging in,
and it's quite warm here.
It's still composting very actively.
We collect our food scraps.
We put them in the green bin.
It goes off
to Recology's compost facility.
We turn it into compost,
and it gets on a farm.
That's a simple solution.
San Francisco became
the most sustainable big city
in the United States of America
in just a few short years,
and we grew our economy.
And if San Francisco can prove an ideal,
then that success can be replicated
in other cities, in other states,
and other nations
around the rest of the world.
Compost is the natural decomposition
of organic matter in nature.
In a forest floor,
it's when the leaves drop,
the fungi and bacteria take it over
and literally build the soil
at the root zone.
Compost is all about community,
from the community of microbes
that are breaking down the pile,
to the community of individuals
in Los Angeles
that are physically turning and sifting
and contributing to that pile.
I collect food scraps
from restaurants, manure from zoos.
Manure. Do you know why?
To keep this stuff out of landfills
and use it to make good, rich dirt.
That's why.
How do we take waste
and repurpose and reuse it?
Because it's really not waste.
My name is Pashon. It's Pashon Murray.
So that was my destiny,
to be passionate about the environment.
When we went to Haiti
to run this compost sanitation pilot…
everybody kind of thought I was crazy.
And maybe I am.
- I'm Steven. Yeah.
- And you're the…?
- The man.
- And I'm the woman.
- Yeah. We are the men around, man.
- Yeah.
Well Haiti happened, obviously,
this earthquake
that was just so devastating.
We all felt like
we wanted to do something.
And Patricia, she's a problem solver.
As soon as she got there, she was like,
"Okay, they have a sanitation problem."
The water under the soil
was getting contaminated.
2.5 billion people
don't have sanitation around the world,
and that means people can get diseases.
So we train people around the world
to have composting toilets
so they can learn how to collect
and treat their own waste
for their community.
The most noticeable change
that we saw was the smell.
The experience of living around
the latrines was night and day.
We're in front of this compost pile.
- Do you guys smell anything bad here?
- No.
Part of the strength of this
system is that it's very easy to learn.
You don't have to order some part
or component.
People can learn
how to do this everywhere.
So here is the spare container.
Here is the sawdust available.
What I love about thermophilic composting
is that it helps address
multiple climate change issues.
It helps us protect water resources.
Treating it
and getting rid of all the pathogens,
and ending up with compost.
And when it's finished,
it will be like beautiful dirt.
You can then amend the soil
and have more crop growth.
The only problem with it
is that people are hung up on the fact
that it's human feces.
We just, in general, as humans,
have a poo phobia.
But what most people don't know
is that all across America,
if you buy some potting mix,
it probably has biosolids in it,
and that comes from human sewage.
We eat food. We poop it out.
We can then treat it and create soil
that has good content for the plants,
and then the circle
just goes around and around.
The poop has to stay in the loop.
This is a very nice toilet,
and I would love to go
to the bathroom in your toilet.
Excuse me, please.
Compost is just one of a suite
of soil-based carbon capture solutions.
The more we choose regenerative foods,
the more that farmers will grow them.
We're at a critical moment
in human history.
There could be a way
to eat food that heals the planet.
The way we're articulating it
is the regenerative diet.
I've personally been vegan for 20 years.
I've just kind of proven in my own world,
like, hey, you can rock life in a…
very healthy, strong,
and powerful fashion
on a plant-based diet.
If you're eating meat, if you can eat it
from a lot more correct high-level farms.
If we do eat meat,
we need to eat meat
that comes from pasture-raised,
grass-fed, humanely-killed animals.
This is the most crucial choice
all of us can make
for the future of the planet.
What are we eating?
What kind of farming systems
are we supporting?
Are we regenerating the Earth,
or are we degenerating?
So what we have here
are two of our egg-mobiles.
Approximately three days after the cattle
move through an area and graze,
we'll bring the land hens in.
They truly are free range.
They could walk to California
if they so choose.
What we did here
is we went to the local grocer,
and we bought a dozen cage-free,
all-natural, humanely-raised eggs.
We'll reach in there
and crack one of those open.
Now, what we have here
is one from our pastured land hens.
Ours on the left is much darker colored.
Now, watch this.
See how that breaks open rather easily?
It's runny.
Now, look at this.
I can poke my finger into there
several times before we finally break it.
Now, look at the color of that yolk
and look at the difference.
Ours are out on pasture.
They eat whatever they can forage for.
These, although they're cage-free,
they are no doubt in confinement,
and they're fed mostly grain.
Ours are going to be much higher
in nutrient density
as compared to these.
And what you're really feeling there
is the nutrients and the complexity
of regenerative agriculture.
Eating a regenerative diet is important,
but so is working with the people
who grow our food.
Today, we estimate
five percent or less of farms
are managed for soil health.
The Nature Conservancy has partnered
with the National Corn Growers Association
to establish the Soil Health Partnership.
Our goal is to grow this to 50 percent
of US farms managed for soil health
by 2025.
This idea of the Soil Health Academy
started about five years ago
when Ray first stepped onto my ranch
and we first met.
Little did we know
what would become of that plan
to try and move regeneration forward.
It's finally come to fruition.
- Ray Archuleta.
- Jesse.
Hi, Jesse. Good to see you.
Let me-- let me start off with myself.
My name is, uh, Ray Archuleta.
I have 32 years of government service.
Our goal was to make the soil healthy
to teach more these ecological principles.
We wanted to…
to mentor, to inspire people
that they're part of the planet,
and that we're gonna have
a better relationship with it.
Used to be
you'd pick up a farm magazine,
and there wasn't a single article
about soil health.
Now, you cannot pick one up
without there bein' some article
about soil health.
That gives me hope.
We can improve soil health
much, much faster
than we used to think possible.
Sometimes, when I give presentations,
I get this group that's just, no way.
It won't happen here. Can't happen here.
So I offer them this challenge.
I said, "I will bet my ranch against yours
that I can get it to work
on your operation."
Because the principles of soil health,
the least amount
of mechanical disturbance, diversity,
armor on the soil, living root
at all times, animal integration…
Those principles are universal.
There is zero doubt,
and I mean zero doubt in my mind
I can get these practices to work
anywhere in the world.
If you look over here,
we have my neighbor's land
that has been chemical fallowed.
It has had nothing growing on it
for over a year
except for the few
Roundup-resistant weeds that are on here.
It's an ecological desert.
Then you look over at our paddocks,
you have a diversity
of different plant species.
You have insects.
You have wildlife,
plus the livestock grazing on it.
We're capturing sunlight from early
in the spring till late in the fall,
converting that sunlight
into liquid carbon
to drive and fuel the system.
There you have soil.
Over on this side, you have dirt.
Where do you want your food to come from?
Which model do you want
your food to be produced from?
The answer is pretty simple to me.
All over our planet,
people are using the practices
of regeneration to heal the land
and balance the climate.
Some of these projects are big.
We know that about 25 percent
of the world's landmass
has been degraded
by human beings over historical time.
When we look
at the cradles of civilization,
Greece and Rome,
we find that many of these places
have turned into deserts.
The sand is blowing across the ruins
of once-great civilizations.
Loess Plateau,
the cradle of Chinese civilization.
That was the place
where settled agriculture first began.
When I was asked to film
the baseline study in the Loess Plateau,
I found myself alone
standing on a mountain top,
and I could look in 360 degrees,
and there was no vegetation.
This was fundamentally,
ecologically destroyed.
It was called
"the most eroded place on Earth,"
filled with miserably poor people.
So I felt that I had to spend
the rest of my life dealing with this.
It was hard to imagine,
at that time, that you could restore that.
So from about 1994 till 2009, 14 years,
an area of 35,000 square kilometers,
approximately the size of Belgium,
they had the top Chinese scientists,
they had international scientists
from the World Bank supporting them…
They created mapping systems
with satellites
so that every watershed
had a unique address.
The results were…
stunning.
Hundreds of millions of people
were lifted out of poverty.
We met people who were illiterate,
and their children now go
to the top universities in the country.
Human beings emerged in paradise.
If we restore
all the degraded land on the Earth,
we can return to paradise.
If we start now
to build a restoration economy,
a regeneration economy,
this is the way forward.
To see a stream return and flow
to bring back fertile soils,
to see biodiversity return to a place
that was completely devastated,
this is where everyone can find
tremendous satisfaction.
♪ When I look into your eyes ♪
♪ It's like watchin' the night sky ♪
♪ Or a beautiful sunrise ♪
♪ For there's so much they hold ♪
So let's restore
a little bit of paradise every day.
It's not that difficult.
If we stop distracting ourselves
with shiny objects,
and we start to think
about what's really important to us,
to see biodiversity returned
to a place it was completely devastated…
This is where everyone
can find tremendous satisfaction
and the meaning of our lives.
We're all in this together.
Every action that we take
affects every other action
like a ripple in the pond.
So what decision are you gonna make
that will make a positive impact
on this beautiful planet
so that our great grandchildren,
seven generations in the future,
can actually go up
and hug an old growth redwood tree,
and swim in clean waters,
and be able to open their mouths
and drink while they're swimming?
And what is it that we can do today
so that our children
can flourish in the abundance
that we've created by our decisions?
I will drive 100 miles,
1,000 miles if we have to,
to save one farm.
To open one heart and one mind.
It's that one mind that you change.
You don't know if it'll affect
another mind, another heart.
It's what happened to us.
It changed our hearts,
and it changed our lives.
No, it's not about religion.
It's not about politics.
It's about love.
And if you love something
or you love somebody,
you want to understand them,
and you want to, like,
take care of them and protect them
and keep them safe.
And that's what we're all here to do.
Even like the little mycorrhiza fungi,
and the worms, and the bacteria.
And if we take care of them,
they'll take care of us.
From the smallest microbes
to the largest creatures,
our blue planet pulses with life.
For millions of years,
it has self-healed and self-balanced.
But, today,
our species faces its biggest test.
Our mission is simple.
We must harness
the regenerative power of Earth, itself.
I'll make you a deal.
I won't give up,
and neither should you.

What is carbon dioxide?
It's, um… Comes from… Um…
That's a trick question for me.
You caught me off guard on that.
I guess that would be carbon
and two atoms-- two molecules of dio--
of whatever.
Something bad?
It's poison that you're breathing.
And it will destroy you.
What are things
that you're doing in your life
to make an impact around climate change?
- Um…
- Um…
- Um…
- Uh…
- Uh…
- Hmm…
I mean, I like to, you know,
do my part when I can,
like, with my metal straw.
- Going to the paper straws.
- No plastic straws.
Paper straws versus plastic.
Recycled straws.
Every time I come here, I feel energized.
If recycling and paper straws
are our only hope,
then we are in really big trouble.
We can absolutely reverse climate change
by making things better,
not just fixing what was bad.
Could you imagine that?
So, we're not just--
we're not-- no longer degenerating,
we are regenerating.
That sound awesome. I want regeneration.
