Deep in the heart of the Aegean Sea
lies the island of Navarone.
In 1943, it stood poised like a knife
in the Allied side.
Secretly designed
giant radar-controlled guns...
...anchored in the bowels
of the ancient rock...
...gave the German High Command
total strategic control.
Frequent Allied air and sea attacks
resulted in total failure.
In desperation, the Allies turned
to a small band of commandos...
...led by Major Mallory
and demolitions expert Corporal Miller .
They succeeded in penetrating
the very heart of the gun complex...
...planted high explosives at the base
of the giant shell hoists...
...and then escaped to await rescue
by ships of the British navy.
- Reduce speed, number one.
- Aye, aye, sir. Down 50 revs.
Fire.
Fire.
Mallory, Miller,
good to have you aboard.
We thought for a moment
we'd left you on Navarone.
Move! Move!
Come on, move it!
Move it!
Move it, move it, move it!
Regulations state, sir, that in
the absence of bacon, ham, et cetera...
...the acting catering officer,
that's you, sir...
...shall authorize once per week,
the issue of offal.
- Offal?
- Offal, sir...
-...is kidneys, liver, tongue, brains...
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Milly, how nice to see you.
- Hello, sir.
- Whatever are you doing here?
- I've no idea.
I'm reporting to Commander Jensen.
I gather you've been hurling yourself
over the White Cliffs. How's the leg?
It's in the same place. I thought
they pensioned you off for good.
You still peddling
those whizbangs of yours?
Yes, we've got things that go boom
for all occasions.
I'm working with a new detonator.
It's interesting--
Excuse me, sir. We can't keep
Commander Jensen waiting.
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.
- He'd like to see you too, sir, together.
Corporal, put that in my office,
will you?
Mallory.
Take a pew. How's the leg?
- And Miller, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Hear you've been attached
to Winston's toy shop.
"Department of Dirty Tricks,"
as the Whitehall chaps call it.
Well, they speak very well of you.
We need you chaps
for something rather special.
I'm afraid it's not exactly
a masterpiece...
...but I wonder if you can identify
this fellow.
Think back to Navarone.
I'd rather not, sir.
Nicolai?
Yes. Let you down a bit, didn't he?
But what about him?
Andreas' people had him shot
as a traitor, didn't they?
Yes, so we were told.
In fact, he escaped.
He wasn't a traitor.
He was a German agent...
...who we believe is operating now
in Yugoslavia with the Partisans...
...posing as one Captain Lescovar.
Now, you both knew Nicolai.
In fact, you're the only people we know
of can make a positive identification.
So I'd like you to go out there
and cope.
Cope, sir?
Kill him.
Discreetly, if possible.
But I'm a civilian now, sir.
Yes, we thought about that.
So you've been recalled
to the current and promoted.
Staff sergeant.
Awfully generous, sir.
Exactly how do we get there?
We're tacking you onto Force 10.
The code name for an operation
for the Allied mission in Yugoslavia.
Excuse me, sir.
What's their objective?
It's being treated
on a need-to-know basis.
And you don't need to know.
Barnsby, come in.
- Sir?
- Colonel.
Force 10 flies out tonight.
Oh, that's all right.
Taking these boys with you.
I beg your pardon, sir?
It's a matter of transportation.
You've got passengers.
Just a sideshow.
This is Major Mallory, Sergeant Miller.
Lieutenant Colonel Barnsby.
Sir, my mission is all set. It's been
planned down to the last detail.
The last thing we need are
a couple of passengers.
Major Mallory does have a certain
amount of experience.
I wouldn't doubt it.
We're talking about
some hard traveling, sir.
We've gotta move fast. My men
are young, in top physical shape.
- They're specially trained for this mission.
- I'm aware of that.
Sir, I am concerned about the safety
of my command.
Now, these chaps have got
a job to do as well.
And it's up to you to deliver them
safely to the Partisans.
And you leave for Italy at 2300 hours...
...and you take off for Yugoslavia
the following night.
Very well, sir.
Thank you. That's all, gentlemen.
Well, we'll do our best not to make
a nuisance of ourselves, colonel.
Sure, you will.
Patch me on
to the prime minister's office, please.
Prime Minister?
Force 10 has been activated, sir.
All right, enough!
- Thought we were going to an airfield.
- From what I've observed of Barnsby...
...we might be going to Yugoslavia
by walking on water.
All right, it's right along here.
Slow down, Nolan.
Stop it.
Nolan, kill the lights. All right, out.
Oberstein, Reynolds, the fence.
Williams, Farrell, get this crap
up to the fence. Come on, move it.
Gonna miss your plane
unless you join us now, major.
Pleasant way with words, hasn't he?
Remarkable way of getting
on an aircraft, don't you think so?
Oh, well, nothing's ever easy, is it?
It's not easy if you insist on climbing
through fences in the dark...
...when there's a perfectly good gate
half a mile up the road.
Anything we can do to help?
Yeah, you can keep quiet
and out of the way, major.
What's with the fence, Oberstein?
Come on, move.
I don't have a lot of time
for explanations.
One thing that you don't know...
...is the last three Allied missions
into Yugoslavia...
...were blown right here in Italy.
So this time when we fly out, we're
not advertising the fact to anybody.
Come on, you guys, shag your butts.
Hustle, hustle.
Holy Christ, will you look at those guys?
They're stealing half the field.
All right, hold it.
Wait for me.
Okay, men, let's go.
Blake, take care of Rastus there.
All right, fellas, freeze.
And you, back, back. Back off.
Bill, Eddie, get those other guys
out of there.
Stay put, you two.
Okay, smart-ass.
- What's your name, kid?
- Walter.
Walter.
What's yours?
Well, it sure in the hell ain't Rastus.
Walter.
Come on, come on.
Come on, you got a stick, you got a stick.
Use it, use it, right now!
Good evening.
Major, move!
Let's get the hell out of here.
- You two guys officers?
- More or less, yes.
We're very much obliged to you,
sergeant.
- Weaver.
- Oh, Sergeant Weaver. Thank you.
U .S. Army Medical Corps.
But, sir!
Still some outside, Reynolds.
Come on, shag it, get the lead out.
Come on, damn it.
Hey, sir!
Where's Nolan?
I think you can take it
he won't be joining us.
Okay, let's go.
What the hell?
You son of a bitch!
I saved your asses back there...
...and you run out on me.
Hey, who is this guy?
Get out of here.
Don't push! Don't push me!
- Look, you--
- I think it's a bit late for that now.
Look, you just shouldn't have
left me there. I saved you bums.
Well, we didn't think you'd like
where we're going.
You let me worry about that, huh?
That guy's gonna melt
into the landscape.
Well, you are one man short.
Well, Nolan can handle a chute,
at least.
- Can you handle a chute?
- I can learn on the job.
That's right, you learn
on the way down.
So sorry.
I was rather hoping we'd lost that.
You never know.
It might come in useful.
Hey, hey, what do you got in there?
My pajamas.
Looks like high-explosive pajamas
to me.
Not to worry, old boy.
Been handling this since I blew up
the nursery with my first chemistry set.
Poor old nanny.
Yugoslavia, dead ahead.
We got company.
Cut two!
Reynolds, bail out!
Jump!
Go!
Come on, move it!
Come on, get out!
Come on, move!
Come on!
Forward.
Forward.
Mallory.
Okay.
- Seen any of the others?
- Not yet. Get down.
Place is crawling with Krauts.
They're coming out of the woodwork.
Yes, aren't they?
Come on.
- Okay, Reynolds?
- Yeah.
- Where's your Sergeant Miller?
- Hanging about, I should think.
How the hell did he get here?
He shoved his way in.
You let him on the plane?
I think he more or less invited himself.
- Where did you learn to use a knife?
- Harvard University, man.
You don't call him "man." You
call him "sir," and you call me "sir."
Your ass is mine. You do as you're told.
Is that understood, soldier?
Yes, sir.
We've gotta get out of here
before that patrol comes back.
Lieutenant Reynolds, take point.
Sergeant Weaver, bring up the rear.
And everybody keep up.
All right, let's go.
Organized young gentleman, isn't he?
Of all the dumb-ass luck, an AWOL
medic and two mystery guests...
...one with a bum leg.
- Any idea where we are, colonel?
- Not a hell of a lot, no.
If we keep going east, we'll
end up where we're supposed to.
How did we get stuck
with those two clowns?
I don't know, Doug.
Some idiot at British HQ.
Come along, gentlemen.
It's not teatime yet.
Do you think that young man has
any idea where we are, Milly?
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- I shouldn't think so, either.
I'll go and try and find out.
Yes, why don't you do that?
Excuse me, colonel.
Do you have any idea where we are?
I've got a good idea where we are.
And how long it's gonna take to get
there, if you two can't keep up.
All right, let's move it.
What lovely chaps.
- How do you suppose he hurt that leg?
- I don't give a shit as long as he keeps up.
- This is really beautiful country.
- Yes, marvelous.
Rather like the Scottish Highlands.
- Do you know Scotland?
- No.
Yes. I've often thought that I'd like...
...to settle down there someday.
Looks like you're gonna have
to change your plans.
Colonel.
Take it easy.
Don't anybody do anything dumb.
Welcome.
Captain Drazak.
17th Partisan Regiment.
- Good morning, captain.
- Welcome, welcome!
Thank you, Captain Drazak.
They frightened you with bandages,
huh?
Without bandages, you:
German, how you say:
You say "flamethrower."
Yeah, yeah, flamethrower.
Hello! Hello!
How do you do?
This is Maritza, good soldier comrade.
How do you do,
good soldier comrade?
Hello, blackie.
Maybe it comes off now, Maritza.
Hold it.
Steady, all of you.
Back off, soldier.
I make big joke...
...but joke on me.
Good, blackie. Come, we go.
We eat with our comrades.
We make friends and drink.
Then we fight the Germans.
Come.
Come, we go.
Where did you learn to punch
like that? Harvard?
No, Harlem. Colonel?
I'm not trying to get anybody
killed, least of all me.
- But that big idiot back there started it.
- Just watch yourself, soldier.
- How's the leg today?
- It's much better, thank you.
Good, good . Well, it looks like
things may work out after all, huh?
Well, perhaps Miller and I can still
carry out our little sideshow.
Sorry about Force 10.
You're down to two men, aren't you?
Of course, I don't know
what your mission was...
...but obviously it just isn't
on now, is it, colonel?
Looks rather like your own youngster,
doesn't he?
Do you really think so?
My friends, come.
Come, we eat.
We are Chetniks...
...not stinking Partisans.
We hunt Allied commandos
like wild pigs!
We work with Germans.
They are our friends.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Major Schroeder, 11th Army Corps.
How do you do, major?
Delighted to meet you.
We thought these people were
Partisans.
Of all the luck, eh, Barnsby?
Sure.
Chetniks? Who would have
believed that?
The other three Allied missions
that fell into our hands...
...were not quite so happy about it
as you appear to be.
I'm not surprised, sir.
But, you see, we're not commandos.
We're deserters.
Deserters?
Give them to me, major.
We kill them now.
You see, we were
in a prison camp in Termoli.
We escaped.
Managed to steal a plane.
Flew here, RAF Lancaster.
Were attacked, hit, bailed out and
landed in your territory, thank God.
Fascinating.
Tell me, why exactly did you desert?
Now, I'm glad you asked that.
Yes.
Well, I am afraid
that is rather a long story.
Oh, please, you must not
be afraid of boring me.
Have you ever heard of penicillin?
No.
No? Well, I'm not surprised. It's new.
It's a drug that prevents wounds
from becoming infected.
It cures a whole range of infections...
...including some of the nastier
social diseases.
It's become one of the most
sought-after items on the black market.
Our friend here, Sergeant Weaver
of the American Medical Corps...
...was our supplier.
You are saying you stole these drugs
from the Army to sell to civilians?
Not just civilians, major.
We'd sell it back to the Army.
Any army.
I see.
Tell me, what has all this to do with
that suitcase that you keep looking at?
Well, that suitcase
is full of our penicillin.
Oh, indeed. Perhaps
I could see some of it?
Certainly, major.
Open it, Miller.
You can't do that here,
you'd ruin the lot.
You know perfectly well that
any contamination will destroy it.
It must be opened
under laboratory conditions.
There's nearly half a million
pounds' worth of stuff here.
I know all that, but the major
is not interested in our penicillin.
He only wants to know the truth.
What's the use of a half a million
pounds to you out here?
Yes, well, that's beside the point,
sir, but I'm not going to open it.
Our story doesn't seem
to convince you.
No, it does not.
That's up to you, but every word
he's told you is true.
If you don't believe it,
check with your intelligence.
They'll verify the entire story.
Oh, I shall certainly verify your story.
Every word of it.
Get in, scum!
Cute story, major, very cute.
Now, what happens
when they open the suitcase?
I should think we'll all get shot.
Don't you, colonel?
Maritza...
...what do you think?
They're lying.
What does it matter, anyway?
Kill them.
Yeah, you are probably right.
Do you know what I was thinking?
After the war, $1 million.
You, a simple peasant girl
from where?
I can never pronounce the name
of the place you come from.
With so much money, we could...
They're lying.
Kill them.
Out! Out!
Out! Get out.
Forward march.
Halt.
What did I tell you?
Well, at least we got
a good night's sleep.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Our intelligence confirms
your escape from Italy.
You and you, follow me, please.
Your escape from Italy is one thing.
The rest of your story
is something else.
I had time to sleep on it.
So this morning,
you know what I did?
I opened the suitcase.
Maritza!
And what do you think I found?
Firewood.
What did you expect? We buried it
before your Chetniks picked us up.
We're not stupid . It's the only thing
we've got to bargain with.
That is what I thought you would say.
I think you're lying.
You know they're lying. Why don't
you let Drazak get rid of them?
Gently, Maritza.
I don't believe your so-called penicillin
exists, but it just might.
So I will let you go
and dig it up for me.
And if we do, you'll shoot us
and bury us in the same hole.
I shall certainly shoot you if you don't.
Well, gentlemen, the choice is yours.
How the hell did we get into this?
More importantly, how are we
going to get out of it?
I'm sure you'll think
of something, major.
Any brilliant ideas, major?
I was hoping you might make
a contribution, colonel.
What I can't figure is how
the firewood got in the case.
Neither can I.
Don't know where we're gonna find
any spare penicillin here, do you?
What are we gonna do, keep
walking until we reach the Adriatic?
I don't think the iron maiden
will let us get that far.
Halt!
What did I tell you?
We are three miles past the spot
where you were picked up.
Well, where is this wonderful treasure?
In your imagination?
No, ma'am, it's not in our imagination.
I think it's a bit further on, don't you?
Yes, it is. Well, I mean,
it's not much further than this.
It's hard to tell,
the whole country looks alike.
You will start digging
within five minutes.
What if we haven't found it
in five minutes?
Then you will be digging your graves.
Hey, colonel.
Wait a minute,
now this looks familiar.
Isn't this our little hollow down here?
Yes, yes, I think it is.
I remember this knoll over here.
Ma'am, this is it.
I think this is it.
- This knoll over here?
- Right.
You see, comrade, we lined it up
between them...
There you are!
- There's our pile of stones.
- Right.
There it is, right over there, comrade.
Gotta get them closer
and we use the spades.
You take the two
that are closest to you...
...and I'll take the other one
and the broad.
I'm gonna get them closer now, okay?
Fritz. Fritz, come! It's here.
- Ready?
- All right.
You can get up now. They're dead.
I'm the one who puts firewood
in people's cases...
...and hides their high explosives.
Don't sit there gawping.
Get out of here.
Keep moving in that direction.
Try to find Petrovitch's Partisans.
Now, go.
Excuse me, good comrade soldier...
...but exactly what story are you
gonna tell Schroeder about all this?
You took us by surprise.
You got away.
Here, hit me.
Did you expect me to go back there
with my hair combed?
Hit me.
Well, all right. I'm sorry.
Harder.
- Come on, colonel.
- She gonna be all right?
Don't worry about that one.
She's tough.
I hope that man Schroeder
believes that girl's story.
If he doesn't believe her, he'd better
think twice about calling her a liar.
What about Miller and Reynolds?
What about them, colonel?
Yes.
I suppose they...
Let's move it.
Do you have the feeling
we're being followed?
About the last 10 minutes.
Next time you can play the corpse.
Yeah, you seem pretty good
with that thing, though.
Could have been luck.
Where are we? What is this?
Partisan territory, I should think.
You better hope.
- Germans?
- Yes, or Drazak, I suppose.
Who are they?
Partisans, thank God.
Good morning.
- We've been looking for you people.
- Be quiet.
You will make your report
to Major Petrovitch.
Hey, what the hell are they
so ticked off at?
- I think we've run into bad company.
- Yeah?
Yes, the leader.
- What about him?
- Afraid I know him.
- Nicolai.
- Who the hell is Nicolai?
It's Nicolai Lescovar.
The man I was sent to kill.
Dam, if it's the one I think it is.
I know where we are.
So do I . Right in it.
Do you think he's recognized you?
Yes, I think so.
Where are we going?
What's going on?
What the hell is going on here?
Lieutenant Colonel Barnsby,
United States Rangers.
Major Mallory, sir.
You got away from the Germans.
How?
We escaped.
Captain Lescovar
has his doubts about that.
If you escaped, why were
the Germans not pursuing you?
We observed you for five miles
before we picked you up.
You should've observed that we killed
two Chetniks that were following us.
- The men with the bandaged faces.
- Exactly.
Hardly a cause for congratulation.
Those two men were Partisans.
Comrades of ours whom we had
infiltrated into the Chetnik camp...
...so now all links with our agent there
are broken, thanks to you.
I'm sorry.
The fact remains
that we're Allied officers.
There's no reason
we should be treated this way.
I'm here in command of Force 10.
I insist that we be allowed...
...to contact the Allied mission.
I'm sure London informed you.
I was informed of your mission.
Personally, I doubt if it was
ever a practical one...
...but now that you are here without
equipment, the question is academic.
And you, major, you came here
as an observer, perhaps?
No, sir.
I was charged with a mission
of my own.
It's confidential.
Confidential!
Sometimes I get the impression...
...that London looks
on this theater of operations...
...as a convenient place for conducting
what they call "war games."
- May I speak to you personally?
- You are speaking to me personally.
- I mean alone.
- No.
The People's Army does not conduct
military business in secret.
Very well, sir.
I was sent here to identify a German
agent, code name Nicolai.
We are reliably informed...
...that he has infiltrated the People's
Resistance Army, and is now known...
...as Captain Lescovar.
And having identified this man,
what were your further orders?
I was to eliminate him, sir.
- Eliminate. Don't you mean kill?
- Yes, sir. I do mean kill.
Do you hear that, Lescovar?
The gentleman from London
wants us to shoot you.
I'm sorry, major.
I must admit you are
indeed partly right.
There was an agent named Nicolai...
...operating somewhere south of here
and also calling himself Lescovar.
But he was identified many
months ago. And eliminated.
The British were informed.
- But London were very specific, sir.
- Yes, they frequently are specific...
...and just as frequently wrong.
Lieutenant Marko,
see that these gentlemen...
...give you a full report on their
activities in the Chetnik camp.
A specific report.
Well, captain, I guess we owe you
a bit of an apology, don't we?
Well, it happens. We all
get badly briefed sometimes.
Wish we had been briefed
about the men with the bandages.
Replaced them with a couple
of your own, that's a good trick.
They were messengers to our agent
at Schroeder's headquarters.
Is your agent small, dark, pretty...
...beautiful gray eyes
and shoots from the hip?
You mean Maritza? Yes.
She took a big chance for us.
She isn't Petrovitch's daughter
for nothing.
Gutsy broad, saved our asses.
We hold this end of the bridge.
Over there, the Germans
prepare for the final attack.
We have been ordered to prevent
them crossing at all costs.
What exactly do they have over there?
Three divisions, perhaps more.
We hold a brigade here.
Soon they will bring up tanks, then--
- Why haven't you blown the bridge?
- We have tried several times.
Each time we lost valuable men.
Major Petrovitch has decided
it is impractical.
Well, he's wrong about that.
There's no bridge in the world
that can't be blown.
That's what Force 10
was here to prove.
I told you before, you have no men,
you have no equipment.
I can radio London for equipment.
Get me an airstrip operational.
Oh, call London, prepare an airstrip
for a plane that may never arrive.
- Have you anything else to suggest?
- Yes.
Give me 20 men,
I can blow that bridge to hell.
You mean you can blow 20
of my men to hell, for nothing!
That bridge is indestructible.
Excuse me, sir,
you don't need 20 men.
You need Miller.
- Miller?
- He's an expert with explosives, sir.
He's probably the best in England.
- This Miller is in England?
- No, sir.
- Prisoner in the Chetnik camp.
- Then he's already dead.
Not necessarily, major.
I refuse to mount a full-scale operation
just to find out, colonel.
I need every single man
I've got here now.
Sir, we don't need to mount
a full-scale operation.
Just give us two men.
We got company.
These officers are from headquarters.
They're here to interrogate you.
You reported five prisoners, major.
Two of them tried to escape.
They were shot.
Major Schroeder is in the armory,
and I have told you before...
...this area is out of bounds to all
of you people, except Captain Drazak.
Kindly remove yourselves
immediately...
...and if you can read, which I doubt,
take a look at standing orders.
There. You have made me
burn the milk.
Sergeant, let it burn.
You see, my colleague does not
believe you are deserters.
- The prisoners, sir.
- What prisoners?
I thought you said these men
had been shot.
Right, gentlemen, shall we go?
No!
This is not correct.
Quick. Miller! Get out of sight.
Bring him. Open it.
- Go.
- Marko.
Partisan bitch!
Always so kind to the men
with burns.
But they have no burns.
The three Germans
with the prisoners that escaped...
...all shot in the back
with machine pistols.
You killed them.
Good . Give me the hat.
Come on.
Open. Open up.
Open!
Open!
- What about Miller's suitcase?
- The girl. She'll know where it is.
Milly.
Thank you, major.
Of all the shitty times to run out of gas.
Weaver, don't stand there with your head
up your ass. Let's get this truck moving.
She okay?
Well, we'll drive as carefully
as we can.
Hey, you . I don't like the way you talk.
- You what?
- I don't like the way you talk to me.
This truck doesn't move till somebody
tells me what's going on.
Now, look, you--
You big-time officers
have shafted me twice.
You tried to dump me in Italy,
ran out on me back there.
- You don't tell me what's going on.
- I don't believe this.
Excuse me, but is your trouble
that you want to be part of the team?
I don't want to be a part
of any lousy team.
I just want some equal consideration.
I don't think you'll get
equal consideration...
...from those people back there.
Do you?
Nobody moves until somebody
tells me what you're planning to do.
We're going to blow up a bridge.
- Is that a fact?
- That's the general idea, sergeant.
- That's why we came back for Miller.
- Yeah, Miller.
You didn't give a mother-hunch
about me.
You came back for Miller,
but you didn't come for me?
No, we didn't.
That's the first straight answer
you've given me.
I think the major's got a point, colonel.
They do look kind of mean, don't they?
Don't stand there gaping like an idiot.
- Get in there and drive the truck!
- All right.
We'll have to do this another way.
Get away from the truck.
Wait for my signal.
Useful little insect, isn't he?
- Keep an eye on him, Marko.
- Miller, you are an incurable show-off.
Don't knock it, major. Don't knock it.
There it is.
Lescovar's confirmed my signals
got through to London.
Do you like that chap?
- Who's that, Lescovar?
- Yeah.
I haven't thought anything
about him.
- Knows his job, I suppose.
- Yes, he does, doesn't he?
All right, sergeant?
What do you think?
Pretty straightforward, isn't it?
Well, no, not exactly.
In fact, not by a long chalk.
I'd say you're flogging
a dead horse there, old man.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Want to take a look?
Are you kidding?
I know every inch of that bridge.
Oh, yeah?
In that case, you'll have noticed
how it's built into the living rock.
And how those main pilings are not
just ferroconcrete, but 20 feet thick.
That's not forgetting--
I told you, London's dropping
the same stuff we had before.
Yes, I know what you're getting,
but it's not gonna be enough.
- What do you mean, not enough?
- You might just bend it a little...
...burn the paint work here and there.
But nothing that would seriously
inconvenience the Jerries, I thought.
Our experts have been studying
that bridge, and they say it'll blow.
I don't know
where you learned your job...
...but I'm talking about
the best engineers in the business.
Yes. They're probably experts
at building things...
...whereas I'm an expert
at blowing them up.
Take it from me that
one would need eight hours...
...to make a decent job of that bridge.
Eight hours?
Assuming, of course, the Jerries are
kind enough to leave us in peace.
- And maybe provide a few working lights.
- Miller.
You've seen those searchlights,
have you? Well, I--
- Miller.
- Sir.
I think you've made
your technical point.
Many thanks, sir.
If I weren't absolutely sure of my facts,
I wouldn't be telling you this now.
And you do understand, sir,
I'm not exaggerating.
What would happen to the bridge
if that central arch...
...was suddenly hit
by several million tons of water?
- Water?
- Water?
I think we've been talking
about the wrong target.
Remember that dam we passed
up around the bend?
What kind of a dam? Where is it?
Two and a half miles up the river.
But, my dear chap,
why didn't you say so before?
Oh, I could do a tremendous job
on a dam, yes.
With a dam, you've got natural
elements working for you.
It's like an enormous bath.
All you've got to do is pull the plug.
Thank you.
Come along, gentlemen.
As a technician, I thought you might
be interested in that dam, Milly.
So the RAF drops the stuff
and we blow the dam, right?
Right.
Is it anything like Boulder Dam?
Now, that baby's big, man.
How often have you used this
as a dropping zone?
Never.
The Germans see to that.
We have to keep moving around.
Makes sense.
Think those two guys know
anything about blowing a dam?
Oh, no, I shouldn't think
they've got a clue.
But never mind, old Weaver...
...we sergeants will see them through
as usual.
- Right.
- Hello.
Ought you to be out and about?
It's jolly cold.
Come on in, take a seat.
Thank you, but one thing
I cannot do just yet is sit down.
You're not staying for the fireworks?
Bags of panic and blue lights.
No. I've seen too many airdrops.
They don't compare
to a nice, warm bed.
Would you believe it? Right on time.
Marko. Marko...
I don't believe it.
Poor bastards.
This was no accident.
We've been had.
We've lost our last chance.
Damn.
Oh, no.
There is no question.
We were betrayed.
Aren't we always
with Allied missions?
Their security's a joke.
It doesn't matter.
We do our part,
and what do we get?
Twenty lives lost.
- One of them--
- It's past.
Finished.
All that matters now is that the
Germans are marshaling their tanks.
They will cross the bridge
at first light tomorrow...
...and there is nothing
we can do to stop them.
And you four gentlemen have
outstayed your usefulness.
You'll be escorted back
to the Allied military mission.
Out of harm's way?
Sir...
...I could leave the Germans
some very nasty surprises.
Thank you, sergeant.
I think we have had enough surprises.
Captain Lescovar, see that these
gentlemen have an escort of two men.
If those chaps had just half
the equipment of the Jerries...
...I could've made that dam
look like a Swiss cheese.
It's absolutely sickening.
Do you think the Jerries will have that
gear we need in their supply dump?
Of course they would.
Lashings of HE, land mines,
detonators, everything.
It's an absolute certainty.
Your escort, colonel.
- I think you will find them reliable.
- Okay, thank you.
I think we're going to need
rather more men than this, captain.
My sergeant thinks that the Germans
have the necessary equipment...
...in their forward supply dump
so that the colonel can blow the dam.
That means you'd have to get
into the marshaling yards at Mostar.
None of you speak enough German.
You need me to help.
Thank you, captain.
- Hope all you guys can swim.
- Would it matter?
No.
- You know, I could get shot for this.
- Couldn't we all?
You look real beautiful, you know that?
Yes, it's all right for you.
You don't have to come with us.
We'll be back in exactly
35 minutes, right?
- Okay.
- That's if the shop's open, old boy.
Pity they didn't teach you German
at that school of yours.
Instead of Latin?
Perish the thought, old boy.
These any use to you?
No, Tellermines is what we want.
They look like dirty
gray-green dinner plates.
Maybe they just haven't got any.
They have.
I wonder what happened
to Barnsby and his truck.
I've been asking myself
the same question.
Well, we can't just stand here
like ducks in thunder.
Over there. The railway wagon.
Get the stuff in there till he comes.
Barnsby should have been here
by now. Where the hell is he?
Beautiful.
- They're just the job.
- Not now, Milly.
Well, I'd rather do it now
than in some ditch.
- How long?
- Oh, about 10 minutes...
...given peace and quiet.
Can't anything be easy?
Hey, where in the hell
have they gotten to?
You maniac.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'll go and have a look around,
see if I can find them.
- There he is.
- Wait. I'll get him.
- That's Lescovar.
- Yeah.
- Where's Marko?
- I don't know...
...but 10-to-1 they're hiding
in that boxcar.
Shithead.
Bloody hell.
What's up now?
Some great ape of a sergeant,
he's sent Barnsby's truck away.
Oh, no.
Sergeant.
Be quiet. Listen to me.
There are two British commandos
in that truck behind me.
Two British commandos?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Colonel Von Ingorslebon,
Special Field intelligence Group.
Stand still, idiot. Look natural.
There is a third, an American colonel...
...in the truck which you
just sent away.
I want to take them all together.
- What's Lescovar doing?
- He's shooting him some kind of story.
Go and assemble a squad
of armed men. Quickly and quietly.
And keep them out of sight.
Then report back to me. Understand?
Good old Lescovar.
Best line-shooter in the Balkans.
What the hell's going on, colonel?
Just shut up and stay out of sight.
Where the hell are you going?
All right, you guys, let's-- Oh, shit.
The sacks, get them up here quick.
- You picked a fine time to do this.
- Sling out my suitcase, will you?
You trying to screw up this operation?
We're behind schedule already.
- How did you get here?
- I've been through that already.
Help me get this stuff loaded
and get it on the truck.
- Right, Miller?
- Right, all set.
Let's go. Easy.
Hold it.
It's that man again.
I'll take care of him. Close the door.
They are all yours, sergeant.
Bring the squad.
All clear?
Give them a moment
to get out of sight.
That fool, Marko,
must have given himself away.
I don't know how.
How in the hell are we gonna
get back across the river?
I mean, where are we going?
Berlin, I shouldn't wonder.
Sarajevo.
That's where the train goes.
No stops.
I'm sorry about Marko.
It's a risk we all take.
He was a brave man
and a good friend.
Do you think that big sergeant
spotted him as a Partisan?
I can't buy that.
The sergeant wasn't that bright.
He saluted you,
you're wearing a corporal's uniform.
That doesn't rate a salute
in the German army.
Not in anybody's army.
Why do you think
he saluted you, Lescovar?
Perhaps he recognized
my natural superiority.
Yes, perhaps.
You say this train goes
to Sarajevo, no stops?
Yeah.
But I noticed on the map that we pass
within a half a mile of the dam.
Strange you didn't bother
to mention that.
Now, what's all this about?
Some fool of a sergeant salutes me...
...and I forget to mention
that we pass near the dam.
And a little while ago, you said that
Marko must have given himself away.
I don't think he gave anything away...
...except his life.
What did you give away, Lescovar?
You think I'm a traitor, is that it?
I don't think, I know.
I've always known.
I just couldn't prove it.
You're Nicolai.
You're the man who
blew us in Greece.
Thank you, colonel.
I've done your job.
You help me do mine.
Come on, you guys, move.
Once the Germans cross that bridge,
they'll cut this country in half.
- There it is.
- Oh, crikey.
It's lit like a Christmas tree.
Doesn't matter. We gotta blow it.
Dawn's around 5:30.
If we don't blow it,
the Yugoslavs will be dog meat.
What you need, sir,
is a little diversion, isn't it?
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Oh, I don't know.
Try and imagine you're a dog.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
On the road, man, on the road.
I thought you were supposed to
pick up dog shit, not spread it around.
Hallelujah!
That's some heavy-duty dog doo.
Just unroll it and string it out.
Shit, what's this,
another one of his toys?
Damn, ain't that something?
Dog turd, snakes.
Come on, blackie.
Come on, blackie.
Come on.
Hey, you bleed red blood, eh, blackie?
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Don't worry, just keep moving.
One slip and we'll both go down.
This way. Over here.
Here.
Right here.
There we are. You all right, old man?
Once those panzers
cross that bridge...
...they'll go through this country
like a dose of salts.
Come on, blow, damn it! Blow!
Give them a chance.
They'll be here in a minute.
If they'd been caught,
we'd have heard the alarm go off.
Almost finished.
How long do we make the fuse?
They're Germans,
they're gonna be punctual.
Usually are.
We've run out of time.
Twenty seconds?
What do you say?
It's your decision, colonel.
I'm asking you.
Twenty seconds sounds about right,
then we won't have so far to run.
It would have been nice
to see that bridge go, huh?
Yes, wouldn't it?
All been very interesting,
though, hasn't it?
Yes.
It didn't do a goddamn thing. Nothing!
Miller! That useless git!
- It didn't...
- What?
- It didn't work!
- I know it didn't work!
- Well, let's get out of here!
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
When I catch that little perisher,
I'll wring his useless neck!
Nothing!
We've been through
all this, and nothing.
Nothing but:
You can't expect an enormous volcano
with three tiny bags of explosives.
You have to let nature take her course.
Give it time, it'll work.
Hold it.
If I were you, I'd get out of here fast!
Faster.
- You son of a bitch!
- I told you, it's only a matter of waiting.
You cute little son of a bitch!
You did it! Come here.
You did it! You did it!
You cute little son of a-- You did it!
Why, you limey genius, I love you!
Steady on, old Weaver, steady on.
You did it!
Miller, you horrible little man...
...you knew that was gonna be
a slow-motion explosion.
You deliberately didn't tell me,
did you?
I didn't want to bore you
with technical detail.
I thought it might be
a bit over your head.
What happened to you?
He bit me in all the excitement.
But damn it to hell, we did it,
colonel, we did it!
Yes, we did, sergeant. We did.
And a merry Christmas.
Yes, gentlemen, we did it.
But before...
...we can start awarding ourselves
Victoria Crosses...
...and Congressional Medals of Honor
and so on...
...and so forth and such like...
...I think I'd better point out that, one:
We're on the wrong side of the river.
That two: We have no hope
whatsoever of rejoining the Partisans.
And that three:
This neck of the woods will soon be
crawling with bad-tempered Germans.
And four:
I don't think that our little genius,
Sergeant Miller there...
...has even got a box of matches
left in his suitcase.
And so, therefore,
I think we can take it, gentlemen...
...that we are going to have
a very long walk home.
