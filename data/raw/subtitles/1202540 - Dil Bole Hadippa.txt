15 August!
Another amazing celebration on
Wahga Border.
Flag must be fly from Red Qilla.
but that's colour is coloring two
countries in one color.
The color of peace,
who exists from those 2 friends,
whose friendship
couldn't be finished from borders.
Their friendship is running when they
both wasn't Choudhary Vikramjeet and
Pathan Liaquat khan but they were
Vicky and Lucky.
Mr. Vicky and Lucky.
One from Amritsar and one from Lahore.
tell us the secret of this friendship.
Ah! Cricket!
Cricket?
lt happened like we both carried bat
together and we learned bowling,
we learned fielding with babes,
but in 1947 a pitch has build,
that we took 40 years to journey from
Lahore to Amritsar.
And these both countries Hindustan
and Pakistan,
both are the sons of same mother,
they both are laid against to each
other,
when borders are opened we thought,
so we thought why we shouldn't
celebrate lndependance day together.
So cricket brought us back together.
First year on 14 August at Pakistan
lndependence day,
and on 15 August on Hindustan
lndependence day,
Yes, one year in pakistan and one
year in hindustan,
for this peace cup our team plays
a cricket match.
Peace Cup!
Yes!
Since last 8 years this cup is the
pride of Lahore.
l think these Amritsar people loves
losing,
You son of lucky if we didn't make
them unlucky in today's match,
so my name is not Vikramjeet Singh.
Like you saw the name is peace cup
but spirit is not less than war,
1 79 runs is a huge target,
just play carefully.
Who is she?
l don't know,
Who doesn't know his off stump then
how would he knew about me,
you talk alot now go,
You don't pull the ball last you
were bowled to pulled the ball.
Friends! Lahore's pride is going
once again to lahore.
My love,
what happened?
Winning and losing is just an excuse
to recall our old memories,
Winning and Losing are never excuse,
Losing is losing,
and victory is victory.
You are right.
Losing is losing and
victory is victory.
l'm tired of losing,
You all have to do some work,
Veera! when this cricket ghost
will leave you,
lf yesterday l would be on pitch,
then our team would must won,
this time l will play for our village
and next time l'll open for lndia.
Come back to earth.

pain,
l am alive with my dream,
Today l will must knock you out,
No guy has born who could make me out.
Mom! are you sure you won't come
lndia along with me,

Every england cricket county wants

in 15 years.
l hope your mother could give me
your 6 months.

for that person,
What should l do?
Father's heart doesn't know maths.

Where is the team?
Can't you see us,
You think it's a team,
l can see only few lazy players.
No team is here for me,
l came here to make my own team,
A team like it has a word defeat does
not exist in it's dictionary.
Who will be select from you....
Select?
Why do you need selection when
team is prepared.
Do you know who am l?
Fast Bowler of Dehli team,

We are spoiling our 6 months
just because of your father sake.
The name is
Choudhary Vikramjeet Singh.
Forget selection, l am just tolerating
you people because of him,
What you are earning in 6 months,
you can't earn that in 6 years.
so don't give me the crap, Coz l'm
not dad, and you don't forget it.
what is the event today that you all
didn't go to school today.
Peace Cup Team Selection!
That's your chance veera.
Veera is not gonna stop anymore.
Few people's dream come true soon,
and few people's late.
but everyone's dream come true.
Open the door.
l can't be late for selection,
lt's not miss. lndia selection,
it's cricket selection.
Girls are not allowed.
Why?
where it's written?
Don't you understand,
Did God gave you less intelligency
like less height.

Are you leaving or should l slap you.
Whom you make sculpt and pray,
you ruined him to make him human,
Veera! what are you doing?

You just come l'll show you something,
l don't want to see,
Just have a look,
This manji is drunk,
and he can't even dance,
And chamkeela is also disappeared,
so what should l do?
We have lot of audience here,
you go to stage from his behalf.
You know all dance steps.

Right and Left hand batsman,
lt's cricket selection inside,
not any Miss. lndia.
No! you go staright,
you'll find all guys there.
That's my space,

Misery is not good,
Your country is sharing powerty
and you can't share the space,
Now look over there.
Son! it's not a child's play,

He is the new captain of team,
l've heard he is sachin in bating,
and Kapil dev in bowling,
He will kill you,

get on side and watch,
how to bat?
Myself Veer Pratap Singh,
tell me how to bat?
Get out of my ground,
why? my chance ain't come yet,
and it will never come,
Cricket's first rule is any player
doesn't moke another player,
No guys has born yet who could
make me out,
lf you can dare then bring your
most fast bowler.
l swear to Sachin,
l will hit 6 sixes from 6 balls.
Learn some respect for cricket,
and learn some respect for players.
lf they can out,
then you can out too.
Sorry! please forgive me,
Give me another chance,
All players are getting 3 chances,
Just give me one,
To save the pride of this village, you
won't find a better player than me,
l ahve already seen how good you're.
Not a player but his bat talks in
cricket.
ln our game batsman got benefit
of doubt,
You won't give me that.
l have waited for this chance in
my life.
lf you will make me run out today,
then this bat....
....will never make run again.
Stop!
He is the only player who don't play
for himself but for his village.
l think you should give him another
chance,
Where you have been?

assignment,
You have a good friendship.
Did you show her house,

What so wrong with london,
First wife then son and now her....

There is a difference between a
player and animal,
You won't eat this meal in one day
but in ten days.
and if you will ever break this rule.
then l will forget that your name
is in batting lineup.
You are saying hello like you're
waiting for some woman's call.
So it's you....
You're not feeling good in lahore.
forget about me,
What do you think you will call your
son from london and you'll win,
Are you watching stars in days,
When son comes after so long,
then what's day and night,
Sun in nights,
and moon in days,
they both looks same,

Your son just came and you
forgot your friend,
Now will you call me or l have
to without invitation like always,
lf l will stop you then you won't
stop,
Come!

So l have brought bread for him,

So, l thought l should wash my stains,

What are you looking at?
These pink lips won't be black if
you say sorry from them,
You are rapping innocent girl.
and then you are shouting on her.
l didn't touch you.
This is lndia, and you know what is
the respect of an indian girl.
You know?
Should l marry you?
150 years wasn't less that l should
marry you and serve the english people.
l didn't get bad days that l should
marry you.
lf you really worried about your
respect then what are you doing here,
Any indian girl didn't speak in towel.
So stop your indian drama,
You forgot it,
everyone make mistakes.
You didn't told me that you have
a sister,
Everyone have brothers and sisters

and indian tigers needs 27 runs

May be its hard to play for him
due to wound
lndian tigers are under pressure
and only 9 balls are remaining
and need 27 runs
beautifull shot

needs 20 runs with 1 over
its the last wicket of indian tigers
due the situation of veer singh,
the captains knows that..
everthing is depend on him
the tension is increasing around
veer singh is ready
And ali ansari will deliver the last over

This winning is of someone else
Veera lie removes by truth
now no more lie
this winning is of veera
So veera show it..
lts a cheating
Your sound of clapping has been
stopped in a moment
this is the truth of a girl
everyone has question..
but has'nt answer
Why veera is in double roll
of veer..
why she's playing under
boys team
l know what you have to say
There's a girls team...
so go on there and play
everone used to give my that
advice in stadium
girls team?
where's girls team in my village
when a girl can play like a boy..
so why no she should play
Why she cant be partner of sachin
See the game of player not
the name
there's a women who went
to the moon in 5 peoples
There's kiran bedi in tihaarjail..
give up jail.. what indera gandhi
left efforts to run the country
She was a bandit queen..
but was a woman
No one said to them that
going inside is prohabited
so there's no diffrence,,
so why here?
hence this diffrence will intact,
every veer will become veera
you'll stop to veera to become veer
and stop her playing too
but how can you stop her
for seeing dreams
l said correct..
everone has question
but no one has answer
Today 14 august is sitting
at the lap of 15 august
who can say that thier sand,
emotions,heart are'nt one
This is the realy victory
of pakistan and india..
victory of peace
