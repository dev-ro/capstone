You! Corporal.
lnside.
Turn your pockets out, corporal.
You won this gambling, of course.
Why do you think it is?
Why do you think you have so much
and the rest of us so little?
One day, you're going
to make a slip.
All this wealth you've got
won't check against my list.
And when you do, when that happens,
l'll be ready.
Then you'll be in there.
ln my cage.
l'm not playing at being
provost marshal.
And l never heard of luck
that didn't run out.
Yours will, depend on it. Because
you're like all criminals, you're greedy.
l'd like to point out that
l don't have to put up with this crap.
l'm not in your two-bit army.
l'm in our two-bit Army.
lf you're looking for something
to live for, when we get out of this...
...come looking for me.
l'll hand you your head.
We'll see.
But you make one slip,
just one...
...and we'll see how long you survive
in my cage.
And after my cage, l'll personally--
l'll personally hand you over
to the Japs.
-What's happening here?
-Nothing, sir.
l'm just searching the corporal.
You're in order to search him,
question him, Grey...
...but threats and abuse aren't on.
They aren't on.
You ought to know better than
to go around dressed like that.
Asking for trouble. Just asking for it.
Even so, quite wrong to threaten.
Not the way to treat an enlisted man.
l think...
...an apology....
lf you request it, sir...
-...then l apologize.
-Very good.
All right, corporal, you can go,
but watch the way you dress.
Yes, thank you, colonel.
-Yeah?
-He had one invite out to number four.
Okay, l'll take care of it.
Find Col. Brant
and give him this.
Tell him not to be so late next time.
Right. Do you know where he'd be?
By the jail. lt's his day
for watching Grey.
-That's all?
-That's all for him.
Then go find that guy with the arm.
He's got a delivery.
Come on, Tojo, time for tea.
Choice of litter, right?
Right.
-You hear the news, Max?
-No.
The war's gonna last
another 10 years. Official.
The last three years
was just for openers.
Lee told me to tell you
he'd done your laundry.
l asked him especially,
and he told me to tell you.
Take one.
King, you don't have to--
lt's okay. l'll call you
if l need you.
You want my chow today?
-You bet.
-You got it.
Max. See that guy out there
with the wog?
Get him for me.
Hey, fella.
The King wants to see you.
-The who?
-The King.
What, is it Garden Party Day
or something?
Save the jokes.
He wants to see you.
l'm not joking. We take our royal family
very seriously.
-What's he want to see me about?
-How would l know? Come on.
Extraordinary court procedure.
Come on. Come on.
-l was sent for, l believe.
-Yeah.
Yeah. Take a seat.
Do you smoke?
Yes.
Yes, l do.
Well, help yourself.
How come we never met before?
-No idea. l haven't been anywhere.
-What's your name?
Marlowe, Peter Marlowe.
What's yours?
How's that chair feel?
Fine.
-Cost me 80 bucks.
-Did it?
-Yes. l'd never have guessed.
-You'd have said more, huh?
l don't think l'd have said
anything, really.
l've never been a great
chair-price guesser.
l was gonna fix some chow.
Wanna join me?
l've just had lunch, thank you.
You could use some more,
couldn't you? You want an egg?
Excuse me, what's all this in aid of?
-Do what?
-People just don't give eggs away.
Well, l'm not people.
-Am l, Max?
-No. No, you're not people, King.
-Well, you want an egg or don't you?
-Well, of course l want it.
Okay, then, you got it.
How do you like it?
-Fried.
-Okay.
So you got yourself a fried egg.
You're not related to either
Fortnum or Mason, are you?
Who are they?
lt doesn't matter. They run a little
family grocery shop back home.
That's pretty neat, huh?
Max wired it for me.
Just telling him you wired the hot plate.
-lt's working okay, huh?
-lt better be.
-l gotta impress the British.
-The British are impressed.
-You speak it pretty good, don't you?
-British? l mean, English?
-No, you know, the lingo, out there.
-Yes, l suppose so. Not too bad.
Say something for me now.
-ln Malay?
-Yeah.
-What sort of thing?
-Anything. l just want to hear you.
That's pretty good.
You hear that, Max?
What's that mean?
lt doesn't really have
a literal translation.
But roughly, it means:
''When do l have to kiss thee
on the ass?''
After the egg, never before meals.
Plates.
Thank you.
How about that?
Not bad. Not bad at all.
The egg ain't been laid
that tastes better than that.
Don't get excited, Fortnum.
When we say not bad,
we don't mean ''not bad.''
-We mean it's bloody marvelous.
-Yeah?
What do you mean when
you say it's bloody marvelous?
Bit dicey.
Forget it.
-Lift your feet.
-What?
Lift your feet.
-You're slumming, aren't you, Marlowe?
-Don't be a snob.
Never make a good policeman
if you're a snob.
Everyone looks the same
with their knickers down.
-Where's your armband?
-ln my pocket.
lt should be on your arm.
Those are orders.
-They're Jap orders. We stuff those.
-They're also camp orders. Put it on.
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing, sir.
Just recovering from the pleasure
of seeing you twice today.
Col. Sellars has reported
the theft of a gold ring.
A gold ring. Gee.
-Gee, that's tough, sir.
-l believe you know Col. Sellars.
-Could you describe him to me?
-You play cards with him?
That Col. Sellars. Yes. Yes.
Plays cards like an English officer and
a gentleman. He would, wouldn't he?
Don't press your luck too hard,
corporal. Just answer the questions.
-Did he ever show you the ring?
-No, he never even discussed marriage.
-l'm warning you.
-You sure you're not accusing me?
-Got a light, Grey?
-No. l'm not accusing anybody.
Then can l borrow your Ronson?
-Ronson?
-Yeah, it's in your top pocket, l think.
Thank you.
Well, now, this is new, isn't it?
Yes. lt was mine.
-We were playing poker. l lost it to him.
-You what?
l lost it to him at poker.
l had a straight, but he had better.
Tell him.
-We were playing stud--
-What were the cards?
-His or mine?
-His.
-Aces on twos.
-You're lying, Marlowe!
Why, Grey, what a thing to say!
lt was pathetic.
l thought l had him with a straight...
...so l threw in the lot.
Threw in the Ronson.
How do you play stud, Marlowe?
-Stud?
-Yes, how's it played?
-Stud? You mean ordinary stud?
-Yes.
We'll show you. There's nothing
like a demo.
You see, it was my hole card--
-l said l wanted you to tell me!
-Temper!
Well, never mind. l don't need
the cards to show you.
Four cards faceup.
You can imagine that.
And one down, one in the hole.
lt's just like Happy Families,
really, in the nursery.
We never had a nursery, Marlowe.
That was a close one.
Too bloody true.
Here.
You're on the payroll from here
on in. Twenty bucks a week.
Okay, we'll make it 30.
Shove your money.
-What'd l say?
-lt's what l said. Shove your money.
One can't expect
bloody Yanks to understand.
All l did was up two 10s to 30.
When someone drops you in it, you
don't pay them for getting you out.
So work your money.
-What'd l do?
-You did nothing, King.
Thirty's above scale.
You treated him right.
Well, screw the British.
Yeah, screw them.
Allied forces are still making
progress in Belgium....
In the Philippines, forces drove a
bridgehead in their thrust for Manila.
Formosa was bombed in daylight
by B-29s without loss.
In Burma, British and Indian armies
are within 30 miles of Mandalay.
Those were the news headlines.
The next broadcast will be at 0600....
-You okay?
-Yes, fine.
The old bladder's flaring up, though.
-What is it?
-Nothing. l just been to the park.
l'm happy to say the old bladder's
working. That's good news.
Beautiful. Thank you for waking
me up to tell me.
God, give me a piece of your courage.
l'm so frightened.
l'm such a bloody coward.
You really ate them in Java?
Not only in Java. Here in Changi.
So did you.
What?
Now, we agreed we wouldn't
cook anything revolting...
-...unless we discussed it. We agreed.
-l know we agreed!
You were dying.
And why do we collect them?
lt's pure protein.
For the hospital, for the seriously sick.
You were sick, remember?
You were dying.
-l really ate them, did l?
-You asked for second helpings.
Well, next time, l want to know.
And that's a bloody order.
-Excuse me, sir.
-Huh?
-Okay, l'll take it.
-Right.
Col. Smedley-Taylor said
two of your men were fighting.
Only two? That's a change. Who?
Cpl. Townsend and
Pvt. Gurble. l've got them in jail.
-l'll deal with them after roll call.
-Sir?
Pity about Marlowe's Ronson,
wasn't it?
Yes, he should have been more
careful. Mug's game, gambling.
-Do you mind if l see them alone?
-No, sir.
Let them out, will you?
Right. Why were you fighting? l want
the truth now, no flannel. Townsend?
Well? l'm waiting.
This bloody sod accused me
of stealing me mate's grub.
-You were.
-That's enough of that.
lf you have a charge to make, make it.
Come on. We haven't got all night.
lt's my month on cookhouse detail,
and today we had 184 to cook for.
-He's me best mate, and l trusted him.
-l never touched a grain. l swear.
When l got back, we were short
two blokes' rations.
-l know, but l never touched it.
-Were they short?
-Sir, l never touched them.
-Were they short like he said?
Yes, sir.
Check the weights.
-l checked them under his nose.
-We must check them again.
Lead the way, will you? We'll go
to the storehouse and settle it.
That day, on my last leave...
...she said....
l said, ''l'll always keep myself
clean for you.''
Oh, God, l'll make any sort
of a bargain with you.
Just don't let her think that l'm dead.
Don't let her think that l'm dead.
As far as l'm concerned,
Gurble, the case is proved.
You're out of my regiment.
You're dead. You don't exist.
You keep your mouth shut.
-My bloody oath--
-Keep your mouth shut!
The news was good last night.
We're only 30 miles from where
the flying fishes play.
By the way, l nearly forgot. The wife
asked if you'd like to come to dinner.
We're just having a few people in,
nothing formal.
Would you say thank you to her?
But l have a dinner engagement.
Well, there it is. Good.
Another time, perhaps. Good.
That was my mistake the other day.
l got stupid. l offered the dough
because l wanted to thank you.
lt's okay. l got a lousy temper and an
awful accent. l sound toffee-nosed.
You British insult easy. Catch one
of these cruds passing up a buck.
Nothing. Go find Prouty in the
Garden of Eden and finish the deal.
l'm different from Hawkins.
l let my doggy off the leash.
Look, can l offer you a Kooa?
l mean, is that all right?
Sure. That's different.
There is a radio in this hut!
Let me handle it.
Now let me in, will you?
-Good morning, captain.
-lt is not a good morning.
There is a radio. A radio is against
the orders of the lmperial Army.
Yes, well,
l don't know anything about it.
-Do you know anything about it?
-No, sir.
-What about you?
-No, sir.
Where's the wireless?
Now, look, it's got to be found,
so where is it?
l order those responsible
to hand it over immediately.
l'm asking you once more.
You, what's your name?
-Lt. Spence, sir.
-Where is it hidden?
l don't know what you're
talking about, sir.
Grey! You're provost marshal.
lf there's one here,
it's your responsibility.
-l know nothing of a wireless.
-You should!
l'll have you court-martialed,
and it'll show on your record.
-Brough! What do you know?
-Nothing. And it's Maj. Brough.
lt's just the sort of trouble
you bloody Americans cause.
-l don't have to take that.
-You stand to attention--
l'm senior American officer, and l
don't have to take that from you!
There's no radio or wireless, as you
call it, in this hut that l know of.
And if there was, l sure
as hell wouldn't tell you, colonel.
Well, then, we'll search the hut.
That's what we'll do.
Every officer will stand
by his bed at attention.
-Do you hear me? Attention!
-Shut up, Jones.
-There's a wireless in this hut, sir.
-Yes, and l said, shut up.
-Can l help you?
-There is a radio here.
-According to the Geneva Convention--
-l know the code of ethics.
lf you believe there's a radio, search
for it. lf you know where, take it.
-lt's your job to enforce the law.
-My job is to enforce civilized law.
lf you want to cite law,
then obey it yourself.
Give us the food and medical
supplies to which we're entitled.
-One day you will go too far, colonel.
-One day l'll be dead, captain.
Probably l'll die of apoplexy...
...enforcing insane laws imposed
by incompetent administrators.
l shall report your impertinence
to Gen. Shima.
Yes, please do.
Then ask him who ordered that each
man should catch 20 flies a day.
And that they should be collected,
counted and delivered daily, by me.
Everybody outside, please.
Now you may make your search,
captain.
Who belongs to this bunk?
l have no idea. l'll ask.
And this. And this.
Who uses this bunk?
-Your name?
-Capt. Daven, infantry.
-Did you make this radio?
-Yes.
l ordered him to make it.
lt's my responsibility.
-ls this true?
-No.
-Who else knew about your radio?
-No one. l made it alone.
lt's all right, old boy.
l'm just as frightened as you are.
You men, pick up this bunk
and follow me.
Doctor, could you come here
a minute, please?
He's lucky. No more aches.
What'd he die of?
Changi blues, mostly.
You mean, the will to live?
No, not quite that...
...corporal.
lt is corporal, isn't it?
Cpl. King?
He quit believing in the pigheaded,
totally unreasonable will not to die.
There's a difference, you know.
Perhaps you don't know.
l don't suppose that kind of
subtlety bothers you very much.
Maybe not. Touch wood.
l wouldn't put much faith in that
wood, probably contaminated.
You don't have any tobacco, do you?
-l hear you're good for a little extra.
-Yeah.
Yeah, l was just going
to bring some to him.
He won't miss it. Thank you.
You must tell me your
secret one day, corporal.
Medically, it ought to be
very valuable.
l'm just lucky, sir.
Oh, no.
That won't do.
Oh, thanks. Can you spare it?
l don't smoke. Never have.
Could you get my boots, old man?
l've got to get up.
-Where are they?
-At the foot of the bed.
l've kept those.
-l've kept them in good shape.
-Yes, you did.
There.
l've had enough, thanks.
l'm dying.
Yes.
-Orderly.
-Yes?
Get the corpse detail
to take Sgt. Masters' bed.
Capt. Daven's will be free too.
But don't let them take the boots.
Yes, sir. What about Col. Hutton?
Do l give him quinine?
-Of course give him quinine.
-Well, l'm sorry. Just asking.
Only doctors authorize drugs.
Give him quinine and stop pretending
you're Florence Nightingale.
There are two appendectomies
for tomorrow morning.
Right.
l'll see them before l go off.
-Do you want me to do them?
-No, l will.
-Evening, doctor.
-Hello, Stevie.
By the way, l finished the autopsy
on the man found in the borehole.
Death was from suffocation.
lf you find a man headfirst
down a borehole...
-...death will likely be from suffocation.
-Yes.
Well, l wrote....
l put on the death certificate:
''Suicide while the balance
of the mind was disturbed.''
-Do you want that?
-Oh, thank you, sir.
Have they identified the body?
Yes. lt was a Pvt. Gurble.
Unusual name.
-Not the way l'd choose for suicide.
-No.
-Unless, of course, he was put there.
-Oh?
-Why do you say that?
-Well, they held a court of inquiry.
-He'd been caught stealing rations.
-l see.
Either way, murder or suicide,
l'd say he deserved it, wouldn't you?
Yes, l suppose so.
-l'd better go and finish my rounds.
-Yes. Well, good night, colonel.
Want a smoke, Stevie?
-There it is!
-Don't let it get away!
-Watch out, watch out!
-Get it out!
-Get him!
-There he is!
-Get him! Get him!
-Right there!
All right, knock it off!
Just hold it! Knock it off.
Will you knock it off?!
Now, just leave it where it is.
Don't kill it.
-l got a better idea. Tex?
-Yeah?
Get a blanket.
-Blanket?
-Yeah. Yeah. Come on, will you?
That's it. You and Max trap it.
Come on. l want it alive.
-With my blanket? You crazy?
-l'll get you another one. Catch it.
Come on. Give me the other end.
Let's throw it down and jump, okay?
-Right.
-Come on. Now!
-l got it!
-Take it!
-Go on.
-Hey, l got it!
All right. All right.
Knock it off! Now, quiet!
-Max, you take it.
-l don't want it. lt's his blanket.
Tex, you go put on the java
while l work this out.
Gather around and hear
the words of the King.
And the whole court
strained in obedience.
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, so we got ourselves
a real live rat, right?
-Yeah. So?
-So? So use your imagination.
What don't we have
a lot of in Changi?
Yeah, besides that.
-Come on. Food. Right?
-What's that got to do with rats?
God.
You're not thinking
what l think you're thinking, are you?
You got it.
-Only we're not going to eat it.
-Eat it?
-Eat what? What's he talking about?
-Rat meat.
You're out of your mind.
Who would buy rat meat?
Let me finish. Of course nobody
will buy it if they know it's rat.
But suppose they don't.
Suppose we say it's rabbit.
There are no rabbits in Malaya.
We'll think of something else.
What are you all knocking it for?
Do you think we can
get away with squirrel?
That's it, squirrel. Good.
Still not a lip-smacker, is it?
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.
l know.
-l know. Deer.
-Deer?
What kind of game
you got back home?
No, not the usual kind of deer.
l mean rusa tikas.
They're about....
Well, they're tiny.
They're about 8 inches high.
The natives consider them
to be a great delicacy.
Rusa tikas translated
means ''mouse deer.''
That's it, then.
We're in the rusa tikas business.
Now, first we got to find out
whether it's male or female.
Then we get the opposite one, and
we're on our way to our first million.
Now, how we gonna sex it?
Hey. l read in Reader's Digest
that the Japs are big sexers.
-That's with eggs, dummy.
-Leave it to me. l'll tell you.
Okay. You got the job.
Now we got two things to do.
Liberate another rat, and then
we gotta find out about their habits.
-Well, Vexley's your man for that.
-Vexley? Who's Vexley?
Join my class?
-You really want to join my class?
-lf it wouldn't be too much trouble.
No. Delighted, old chap.
Delighted.
-Squadron Leader Vexley.
-Pleased to meet you.
Hello, Peter.
All right, then.
Comfortable?
Good. Now, today....
Today l was going to talk about...
...the largest of mammals: whales.
Do you know anything
about whales?
Huh?
Whales are, without doubt...
...the highest form
to which nature has aspired.
Now, you take
the sulfur-bottomed whale...
...the most powerful animal
in existence.
Now, you take its mating habits.
lts mating is marvelous.
There's no other word for it.
The male...
...starts his titillation...
...by blowing glorious clouds
of spray.
He then pounds the water
with his tail near to the female...
...who waits with patient lust...
...on the ocean's surface.
He then dives deep
and soars up out of the water...
...huge, vast, enormous...
...and crashes back
with thundering flukes...
...churning the water into spray,
pounding at the water.
-You have a question?
-Yes, what about rats?
l beg your pardon?
This is interesting about whales,
but what about rats?
-What about rats?
-Do you know anything about them?
Rodents are entirely different.
Now, to return--
-What do you mean?
-What?
How are they different?
l'll deal with them in the next series.
There's nothing about them to like.
Why are they disgusting, sir?
l mean, do they have bad habits?
-Everything about them is--
-Cigarette, sir?
Why...
...thank you, corporal.
Take a couple, sir.
l'm sure you'll need them if you're
gonna go into rats in detail.
Well....
Right. Now....
So, gentlemen, the female can have
up to 12 litters a year...
...and anything up to 14 per litter.
The young being born blind
and helpless 22 days.
Twenty-two days, gentlemen,
after contact.
The young open their eyes
in two weeks...
...and they become sexually active
in two months.
-Holy cow!
-Know what that means?
That means in six months, we're
gonna be knee-deep in tikas.
Holy cow.
On the other hand, they do have
some rather nasty habits.
Number one: They're cannibals.
Number two: They'll fight
if left to their own devices.
But on the credit side,
they'll eat anything.
l repeat, anything, dead or alive.
Which means we got no
logistics problem.
l got another one.
While you jokers are talking,
l'm out doing.
-lt's the right mate too.
-How do you know?
-l looked.
-Well, what are we waiting for?
Tex, Dino, keep lookout.
Hey.
Looks like Vexley knows
what he's talking about.
Start counting the days, gentlemen.
He looks different.
Don't you think
he looks different somehow?
Yeah, he looks like a married man.
All clear?
Come on, we got things to do.
You want to do something for me
tonight? Do a little interpreting?
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
What have you got in there, Marlowe?
-Food.
-Could l see it, please?
Stop picking on me, Grey.
Where'd you get it?
-l was given it.
-We can guess who by, can't we?
-Where are you taking it?
-To the hospital.
-Who for?
-Mac. Any more questions?
No. Not for the time being.
Don't forget, you and your crook friend
are on my list.
l haven't forgotten about the Ronson.
l don't know what you're talking about.
l haven't broken orders.
You will, Marlowe, you will.
lf you sell your soul,
you've got to pay sometime.
Don't give me all that sally army stuff.
l judge a man
by the company he keeps.
Your friend's a crook, a liar
and a thief.
You're right about one thing, Grey.
He is my friend.
But he's not a crook
and he's not a thief.
But he's a liar.
We're all liars, Grey.
You denied the radio.
You gotta be a liar to stay alive.
Do a lot of things to stay alive.
Like kissing a corporal's ass
to get food?
l said it first, Grey.
You won't believe me,
but l said it before you.
He's not interested.
He says the market's very poor.
Yeah, that's why he's here
risking his neck.
Tell him 3000.
Tell him l'm sorry it's overpriced.
-He offers 600.
-Tell him to work it.
No, no. That's a joke.
Now, you're doing very well.
Tell him l can't insult the owner
with such an offer.
-How'd we do?
-Well, he's gone to 1000.
l'd need more than that
to live with the smell.
Tell him l sold one just like it a week
ago to one of his buddies for 3000.
Tell him it's only because l like his
smiling face, et cetera...
...you know, the usual horse manure.
Work him up a few hundred at a time.
l gotta go consult with the owner.
Four hundred? Why, everybody knows
an Omega's worth at least 2000.
l agree, sir, but you know,
beggars can't be choosers, sir.
l did my best. l really put it to him.
l'm sure you did, l'm sure, corporal.
Not your fault, don't think that.
But.... But what am l to do?
Could you have one more try? Please!
See what you can do. Please!
l have great faith in you.
l couldn't take less than 1200.
Well, l don't think l can
do much, sir, but....
Okay, l'll give it another try.
-Twenty-six hundred dollars?
-Twenty-six hundred.
Watch it 'cause he spits when he's
doing the ''l've been robbed'' speech.
Poor man's Bela Lugosi.
He'll come back.
-He's gone to 2100.
-That's what he intended to pay.
Tell him 2600 or nothing.
Twenty-two hundred,
and that's his final offer.
Yeah, it probably is too.
All right, tell him l accept.
Tell him he's too tough for me.
Tell him l'll have to give my
commission to make up the difference.
-Only 900?
-Afraid so, sir.
l had to sweat blood to get that.
Nine hundred, less commission.
Terribly disappointed.
lt's the last thing l owned.
Well, things are getting tougher
all the time. Good night, sir.
-l didn't bring you much luck, did l?
-You owe me 2 bucks.
-Two what? For what?
-lt's your commission.
You don't think l'd put you to work
for nothing, do you?
l'm not entitled to anything
for interpreting. l was happy to do it.
Listen, take it, $ 108. Ten percent.
lt's yours. You earned it.
Look, how in the hell can l earn $ 108
out of a total of 2200...
...and there was no profit?
l'm not taking it.
Boy, l don't know how you survived
in this world up to now.
Look, let's go through the facts of life.
Now, your gallant Maj. Prouty
is selling me a phony.
So he deserves whatever he gets.
Think he gives a damn about me
if the watch backfires?
Maybe he stole it, who knows?
Anyway, he asked me 1200.
Now, l asked Torusumi 26...
...and he settles for 22 because
he knows he can get rid of it for 35.
l give Prouty 900, less 10 percent.
And he goes home thinking that
he's taken me, so everybody's happy.
Now, as to overheads, l had to pay
$ 100 to get the watch fixed.
You know, so it shouldn't fall apart
in his hands.
Another 120
for various safety measures.
That makes 1120.
Now 1120 from 2200
is $ 1080 even.
Ten percent of that is 108.
l gave you 110,
so you owe me 2 bucks. Okay?
You worked for it. lt's yours. Nobody
is giving you anything for nothing.
No.
Well, cheer up, old boy.
Listen, on your way home,
you'll see Brant.
Give him his wages, will you?
-Brant? You mean Col. Brant?
-Yeah, Col. Brant.
Give him his wages. He'll take it.
Well, trust me. Good night.
Good night.
Murder!
Murder. l want the charge of murder
sworn out.
l demand a court-martial for murder!
Look. Look! Look!
That beast killed one of my children.
l want a charge of murder sworn out!
-What beast are you talking about?
-That beast, that murderer!
He's mad. lt was an accident.
The dog got off the leash, that's all.
l keep telling him
it was an accident.
He killed it. That bloody beast
killed my child and ate it!
-Colonel, it's a hen, not a child.
-My hens are children, idiots.
l'll kill him and his bloody beast.
l've said l'm sorry.
lf l had the money, l'd buy you 10,
20 hens, but l can't.
-For God's sake, do something.
-What can l do, except report it?
-You'll have to get rid of this dog.
-What do you mean?
-What do you mean?
-What l said, get rid of it. Kill it!
-You can't order me to do that.
-Like hell l can't.
You've been told to keep
out of this area. lt killed the hen.
l'm going to kill it. The dog's mine
to kill, an eye for an eye.
Col. Foster, l have ordered
Capt. Hawkins to destroy his dog.
lt's mine. l'm going to kill it
just like it killed my baby.
Col. Foster, accept my apologies.
l'll do anything you want...
-...but let me keep my dog.
-lf you don't get away, colonel...
...l'll put you under arrest.
l'll get even with you. Murderer.
l'll get even with you.
l'll get even with you.
l'll get even with you.
My baby.
My baby.
Grey, please take back that order,
please.
lt's such a small thing to ask.
l'll do anything at all.
But l can't. You know l can't.
l'm sorry, there's nothing l can do.
You'll have to kill your dog.
l don't care how you do it,
but do it quickly.
Help! Help us.
Somebody, please help us.
Somebody, help us.
Please.
You're sure about this, are you?
And that was the whole message,
just ''come here, 54''?
Come on in.
lt's my birthday.
l thought l'd invite you for dinner.
lt's real, is it? ls it real?
ls it real pig?
You fantastic sod, you're just the
bloody end. Where did you get it?
A long story.
You couldn't invent the wheel,
by any chance?
-What's all the big noise about?
-Griffiths, is that you?
-Want to get us jailed or something?
-No, sorry. Sorry.
-Keep the noise down, you stupid git!
-Who was it?
That's Griffiths. He owns this cell.
l hired it at 3 bucks an hour.
-You don't get nothing for nothing.
-You hired the cell?
Griffiths is a smart cookie.
Thousands of guys here, right?
No peace and quiet. Griffiths hires it
out for anybody wants to do a Garbo.
l bet this wasn't his original idea.
There's no pulling the wool
over your eyes, is there?
How much you make on it, corporal?
Just an honest 10 percent.
Check the door seals, Tex.
This smell gets out,
we can get torn apart.
