- Getting it?
- How do I do this one?
- Two similar things. Similar.
- Oh.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Hey.
I got a thing to take care of.
Okay.
You gonna make a big thing
of it, huh? Give me that.
Give it to me.
Fucking ice.
What's that?
Thought I told you
to get Schlitz.
They were out.
You're so fucking lazy.
You know, tomorrow...
I want you to walk
the extra block
and get me the beer I like.
Why aren't you writing?
'Cause, man, we're over here
watching paint dry, okay?
It's ridiculous.
We're building a case.
The Irish have
nothing except Hell's Kitchen.
So pay attention.
We're pushing
our fucking luck here.
Jimmy, what the fuck you saying?
Irish are all moving out.
New people move in, we're done.
We don't have control
anymore, okay?
So this, right here,
this is about survival.
Loans. We got to get into loans.
Yeah, I heard, Rob.
I know, loans. Jesus!
You understand?
We do this one thing.
We do one more hit,
we have the cash to get started.
One fucking thing, Jimmy.
Jesus, let's fucking go.
Are we good?
Ah, let's just get it over with.
Fucking hands
in the air, motherfucker!
Hey! Open the fucking safe!
Move it! Open the goddamn safe!
This is Agent Martinez
requesting immediate backup
to Cash & Carry Liquor
on 11th Avenue.
Hey!
FBI! On your knees!
Ah.
Get the fuck on your knees!
What do you want?
What are you looking for?
- Fuck you!
- Hey...
Come on, huh?
Think you run this neighborhood?
You don't run shit.
- We do. We do.
- Stay down.
Let's go, Kevin. Let's go!
Get off!
Silvers, you all right?
Stop right there.
- Yeah.
- Right there.
Arms down.
On your heads!
- What the hell?
- Transferring them to Rikers.
- Not a fucking word.
- Come on, no stopping.
- Let's go.
- Sorry, baby.
Two counts assault
on a federal agent.
Armed robbery.
Racketeering.
I already called the lawyer.
- Is this your wife?
- Yeah, it's my wife.
- Seen it all.
- The fuck you say to me?
Hey! Baby!
We'll be home tomorrow.
Friday latest.
Okay.
No matter what, don't react.
You are hereby
sentenced to three years.
Sentences to be served
at Eastern Correctional.
Congratulations.
Come on.
What's she doing
with Little Jackie?
- Fuck Reggie Jackson.
- Mark!
Thurman Munson's the
heart and soul of that team.
Mark! Bring these over.
He's the MVP.
One more.
Now shut the fuck up
about the fucking Yankees,
all right?
Here you go, Mrs. O'Carroll.
Thank you.
That's a thing to say?
"Thank you"?
Like I gave you a present.
I didn't give you
a goddamn present.
I didn't mean anything by it.
I just, you know,
appreciate all this.
Oh, you're grateful.
Joseph was grateful
when the wise men let Mary
push her kid out in the barn.
He was grateful
'cause they let her
lay down in the dirty
fucking hay
after some other guy
knocked her up.
Are you grateful like Joseph?
Huh? You know
what happened to Joseph?
Anyone?
- No.
- No.
Neither do I.
Bible doesn't tell us.
He just disappeared.
Don't be fucking grateful.
Your mother-in-law
is a real cunt.
My beautiful daughter.
To your health, Helen.
And you, too, Jackie.
Oh, shit.
When Martin was sent up,
I mailed him cookies every week.
Every week for two years.
Kevin doesn't like cookies.
I never much understood
why Kevin likes what he likes.
You
girls are gonna be just fine.
You never worried about
any of thiS before.
Don't worry about it now.
Nothing's gonna change.
We're gonna take care of you.
Hey...
Family, right?
You fucking twats.
I'm gonna say good night to Dad.
Okay.
- Night.
- Kath...
The kidS already
got their coats on.
Kathy.
Are you gonna be okay?
Of course.
Well, you need money?
Dad, you haven't worked
in three months.
Yeah, but if you need money...
We've got some saved.
Enough for three years?
They're gonna take care of us.
Oh, so that's how it works
with them. IS that it?
Like you don't know.
No, those are your mother's
people. Not mine.
Okay, Dad.
Look, you keep taking
money like that.
Profiting.
What happens
when you go to jail?
What happens to the kids?
- The kidS are cooked.
- Yeah, okay.
- Night.
- Yeah.
Okay, let'S go. Come on.
My piece was definitely
bigger than yours.
They gave me a bigger fork
so I could eat more.
Well, at least mine tasted good.
Okay, enough, enough.
Go brush your teeth.
- Go brush your teeth.
- Fine.
Kathy Brennan.
Unemployment iS
at near record highs.
What happens
when one of your kids
gets sick
and you got to call in?
Most employers don't want
mothers with young kidS.
It'S a competitive market.
Employers are looking for
people they can depend on.
You don't know me.
And you got shit in your teeth.
What can I get for you?
You got a little
something for this?
You got to go talk to Helen.
She's your mother-in-law.
ThankS.
If I confront Helen,
I don't know
how She's gonna take it.
Kevin's gone
for the next three years.
That'S plenty of time
for Helen to figure out
some kinda way
to kill me in an accident.
We need to talk to the guys.
And we need to talk
to the guyS together.
Oh, I don't think you need me
in there mucking it up.
What, you want me to walk
in there all by myself
with those motherfuckers?
They didn't want me in
the family in the first place.
I'll just take
whatever they give me.
I'm not confronting them
or anything.
Rob took care of you?
When has Rob
ever taken care of me?
I have $43 in the bank.
I can't even make the rent
with what they gave me
last night.
Claire, I went out there
this morning, okay?
To a job bank.
But there's nothing out there.
There iS no place
for us out there. None.
I'm volunteering
at church today.
I can get a job.
I'm not taking on those guys.
Who'S gonna hire you?
Besides getting hit,
what other skills do you got?
That's too much.
What are we gonna do?
Well,
you're the smarter one here.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Hey, baby. You want me
to warm you up, hmm?
Fucking bitch.
Man, you talk about
humming down the highway,
that sucker will haul aSS.
Hey, Duff, you still driving
that piece of Shit
with the hole in the floor
next to the clutch?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey, fellas.
Duff.
Hey, Colin, how'S your mom?
She's good. Yeah.
Good, good.
We, uh, we don't wanna
be a bother. We just, uh...
We just need a minute,
and I made you
some cookies, so...
What can we do for you?
Um... Well, we got our money.
You know, our envelopes.
You're welcome.
Yes, and thank you.
I just, uh...
There was leSS in it than
what we were expecting and...
So...
what exactly were you expecting?
Huh?
How much were you
expecting from me?
Payments are down.
The collections are down?
Who'S not paying?
- The Murphys, Hogan...
- Hey!
Who'S talking? You talking?
I meant, you know,
if it would help or anything,
if people aren't paying,
I would be happy
to go talk to them for you.
Yeah, okay.
You're not talking to anyone.
You're not collecting.
I run Shit now! Me!
She's got kids.
You will be happy
with whatever fucking money
I decide to give you
out of the kindness of my heart.
Now get the fuck out.
Hmm?
You wanna paSS the cookies?
Shut the fuck up, Burns!
Hey, hey, hey.
Didn't Burns say Hogan's
was holding out on us?
Yeah.
Hey. DRIVER: Hey!
I kept back 50
because that money
is supposed to be
for protection.
And they stopped protecting
as far as I can see.
What do you mean
they stopped protecting?
Two kidS in here last week.
Stole ice creams out the back.
Not from around here, you know?
This week,
kidS came back with a gun.
Took me for a whole day's money.
I reached out to Little Jackie.
Never even called me back.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
- Of course.
You know the rules.
If you're high, you don't eat.
Sober up. Come back tomorrow.
Hey.
We got to deal
with our Situation.
All these men
working these streets
and not a solid
set of balls anywhere.
Fuck balls. Where have they
ever gotten any of us?
It doesn't take balls
to do thiS work.
It'S about being smart.
It'S about, you know,
taking care of people.
People respect you.
You could do this.
They have been
telling uS forever
that we are never
gonna do anything
but have babies.
And now we got no degree.
We got no money.
Piece-of-shit bunch of guys
that don't even remember
what family means.
So we remind them.
We could.
I mean, we really could.
You know, this Hogan Situation.
People have issues, you know?
And they're waiting for somebody
to Show up
and actually deal with it.
We could do that.
We take over the collections,
we can actually
make good on our word.
We could do this.
Sister, let me help you.
Oh, yes, uh, take the top
three to Father's office.
Of course.
Get... Get outta here.
No, no, no!
All right. Okay. It'S okay.
They got the guy. Arrested him.
Three stitches ain't so bad.
I'm in here every other week
with Peter for three stitches.
No.
My whole life, you know?
I've been knocked around.
When I lost the baby...
I said that'S it.
It'S not gonna happen again.
That lasted two monthS.
Then Rob hit me again,
and I stuck around
because I'm...
You're not weak.
You're not weak.
The homeless guy knows.
A stranger sees
he can baSh me around.
I got three years, maybe leSS,
before Rob is home.
I can't.
I am not gonna get knocked
around ever again, okay?
I think we're all done
being fucking knocked around.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we are.
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
- It'S okay.
He pays them when the sun is up,
when it's down, and we don't
get nothing for it.
- Huh?
- I said you give away
our money and you don't
get nothing for it.
Need a hand?
Forty years, we pay protection
and never bothered me a bit,
'cause I knew
if I had a problem,
guy like your grandfather
would take care of it.
Now?
Anything you need,
we're here for you.
I mean, I could have the kids
come over tomorrow afierschool
and wash that graffiti
off the windows for you.
That would be a help.
Look at him.
He can't do anything anymore,
he's so old.
Bet you still can cut a rug.
Oh, yeah.
You know what,
what do I care if I pay you
or I pay Jackie Quinn
and his numbskulls?
I don't know.
Jackie's not gonna like this.
We'll talk to him.
I'm not looking for a war.
Duff, you're my cousin.
You're blood.
Kevin and the others get out,
who are the first two guyS
they're gonna
come take a look at?
So, I know you're not
looking for trouble.
Problem is, you don't
help me out with this,
trouble might come
looking for you.
- Lwent high.
- Over my head!
My girl called in,
so I can't do hair.
Yeah, we're not here
for hair, Donna.
You want nails?
- Pick your color.
- No, uh...
We know that your girl
didn't call in.
She can't get her
cosmetology license, right?
How you hear that?
I got a cousin.
In the Division of Licensing.
He could, you know,
help speed things along.
Get her permitted.
What do you want?
We want you to start paying us.
And we will make sure that you
get something for it.
What about Little Jackie?
Anything he's owed,
we'll get it to him.
Uh...
Here you go.
Wake up!
- Get up! Move!
- Come on!
This is my motherfucking block!
This neighborhood
haS been family-run
Since we got to America.
This is our land.
And this store is your birthright.
And if anybody screws with that,
we will deal with them.
You holding up okay?
Guys taking care of you?
We're okay.
I'm taking care of myself.
What's that mean?
Our money was a little light,
so Claire, Ruby and me,
we're helping out.
- Kathy...
- It'S nothing.
Hi, Kathy.
Hey, Kevin.
No Ruby?
Do you see Ruby?
No.
I don't see Ruby.
Then I guess She's not here.
Whatever you're doing,
stop it. Now.
My God, I lost count again.
- Seven.
- Don't.
- Thirteen.
- No. Don't.
- Twenty-two. Sorry.
- Oh, my God.
I can't do it.
- It'S working.
- Mmm-hmm.
AS far as I can see,
we just need one more
piece of the puzzle.
What do you want?
The FBI still
watching the Kitchen?
What do you think?
The FBI tells me everything
they got going on?
How Should I know?
What do you know?
No, no. As far as I know,
they rolled outta here
after they got your husbands.
What about NYPD?
Are they on us?
Who is "us"?
I saw, uh,
Carol and your kids out there.
Nice you take 'em out
to dinner once in a while.
Does Carol know where
her rabbit vest came from?
Or her Gucci bag?
The Gucci bag'S a fake,
by the way.
Jimmy told me it was real,
but I took it to a guy
who said that it's a knockoff.
Does Carol know that?
Please...
I'm begging you.
Could you just...
We don't want you
helping Little Jackie.
And we especially
don't wanna hear
that you didn't tell us
something important.
Our husbands think
you should have known
they were being watched.
I told them. I swear to God.
I had no idea.
I should probably
get outta the bathroom,
othenNise people gonna that
you're blowing me in here.
I'm gonna wash my hands later.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I just need to squeeze,
scooch in here.
I'm gonna unlock it and go.
Were you getting
your fucking nails done?
What took you so long?
They said they already paid
for the week.
Fucking girls
are a serious problem.
Hmm.
It'S not that funny.
Oh, Shit!
- You got everything?
- Yeah.
All right. Be good, okay?
- There he is.
- Grandpa!
Hi. Hey.
I'll be by around 10.
All right, come on, kidS.
Let's go.
Dad.
Dad!
We got a problem.
We can't do this no more.
Little Jackie's pissed.
You said you'd talk to him,
tell him we weren't
going against him.
Little Jackie's not
handling the busineSS...
I don't give a Shit.
Look, you're nice girlS
and, Kathy, I love you.
I respect you want to
do things the right way,
but whoop-de-fucking-do.
I ain't dying for thiS shit.
Later.
I mean, if
Little Jackie's mad at them,
he's definitely
gonna be mad at us.
So?
So?
He's vicious.
You think we're giving up
because of these fucking idiots?
We need to talk.
Huh?
You're over, Jackie.
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.
Yeah? I could say it louder.
You know, family or not,
you were anyone else,
you'd be dead already.
Told you
he wasn't gonna do nothing.
Always was weak.
Lock your fucking doors.
I don't know
what you want from me.
I don't control every
little thing Jackie does.
That right?
That'S right.
Well, what are you saying?
What Should we do?
Run.
Kathy.
Ma, I'm coming.
Back up. Hey.
KidS need clean stuff
for school.
Okay.
Did you sleep in your clothes?
- Just come in.
- What'S going on?
I don't like knowing
you down there with them.
You remember
when you were seven?
You had that teacher
overdosed in the bathroom.
I ain't had no teacher...
You did.
That white guy.
He was out Sick.
With a needle in his arm.
What are you, stupid?
I was 7.
You made that
motherfucker a card.
All the other parents
looked at you
with glue and shit
all over your hands.
Whole neighborhood
knowing you soft.
Fucking humiliating.
IS that why you beat me
when we got home?
Our family aren't fighters.
They all "yes'm" and Shit.
Look at your father.
Shit I had to put up with
from him.
Ibeatyou,
because I knew I had to run
that soft shit right outta you.
Like driving out the devil.
This... why I beat you.
Claire.
Gabriel?
You okay?
Um...
This doesn't feel good.
It feels really bad.
That I needed you
to come along and save me.
I heard he was back in town.
I called him up.
Why did you call him?
He's a psychopath.
He's a vet, and he's messed up.
We don't need a man coming in
here and fighting our battles.
The motherfuckers out there
think we do.
The men need us to have a man.
Enough.
Gabriel saved my life.
And I'm not sorry
Little Jackie is dead.
Are you?
Easiest to break
the limbs down first.
Gives us more room to play with.
So, you wanna work
the knife in here
behind the knee, where its soft.
There.
So you push through here.
Right. Take it out
like this and you flip the knife
and you cut down.
That'S the hard part.
Turn the knife
back around again.
Get up back through
where you came from,
back and around,
And once you got through that,
you break the leg. Like this.
Fucking right...
There.
I'm gonna Skip ahead.
The most important part,
you got to Slice open
the abdomen
and stab out both the lungs.
Those places hold onto air.
You don't do that, you put
the torso in the river,
the torso floats to the top,
and then you got real problems.
So, long knife.
You come down through here.
I can't. I can't...
Can I do the other leg?
Sure.
The currents here have
always been good for this.
Anything you give it,
the river will take
right out to sea.
You been gone
a long time, Gabriel.
Yeah.
Almost two years.
Because of work I did
for your husbands.
- Andrew O'Connor.
- Billy Walsh.
Both of them, yeah.
I went out west. I laid low.
It blew over. I came back.
But just to be clear,
now we run this neighborhood.
Hey. Hey!
You're off the street now.
You work with us.
Come on.
So you're gonna start
fucking following us
and then everything'S gonna
get a lot smoother.
Okay?
And don't roll your fucking eyes
when I'm talking to you.
Psst. Baby.
Come here.
You got to trust us. Right?
Hi, Mrs. O'Carroll.
Ah, Giovani.
What can I get you?
I got to think about that.
Hello, Helen.
- The hell you...
- Shut the fuck up now.
I deserve better.
Oh, you got a problem
with the personnel change?
Neither of you get to say.
I do. I say what's what.
Yeah? Your husband,
your son, Jackie.
I thought it was all on them.
Now you get to say?
Kevin's out
in a couple of years.
I raised him right.
One good thing I done.
Till then, knock yourself out.
Yeah. Knock yourself out.
- Okay. We'll do that.
- Yeah.
I don't...
I don't want you to do it.
I want you to teach me
how to do it.
Okay.
ItsoundS really nice out west.
Hmm.
Could've stayed.
Why'd you come back?
I heard Rob was away
for three years.
Thought...
Thought now might be the time.
For what?
For you.
I can make my own choices.
I know.
But if you've got problems,
you come talk to us.
Problem is
the city'S going to Shit.
You gonna fix that?
No, but I'm gonna make sure
they don't fuck
with Hell's Kitchen.
You speak Jewish?
You talk to them
over on 47th Street.
So, what can I do for you?
Oh, Mr. Kanfer, we're
not here to sell you diamonds.
I thought that...
Can we talk alone?
I'm sorry, no.
It'S not proper, uh,
for me to be alone with...
She's my niece.
The empty lot out there.
You filed planS with the city
for a 28-Story building.
When do you start construction?
How exactly can I help you?
And why is it
that you're not using
any union contractors
to do the work? Hmm?
Are you from Hell's Kitchen?
Then this conversation is over.
We're just here to talk
about your options.
I can build my buildings
however I choose.
That'S my option.
Oh. Except we're your
neighbors, you know?
Just a few blocks away.
We could look in on the Site,
make sure that,
you know, everything is
running smoothly.
You can't put a price tag
on skilled laborers, huh?
I don't need your help.
Or the help
of whoever you work for.
Oh, we don't work for anyone.
Well, in this neighborhood
we take care of our own.
Oh, see, you don't.
You can't.
Rachel, uh, could you
get me a coffee?
We get help from Brooklyn.
Fuck Brooklyn. They're across
the river. We're here.
Get the hell outta my office.
Now.
I can see you got brains.
And I know you got money.
But we got one thing
that you don't.
We got criminals.
And they're right down
the street.
I 'chaim.
There.
That'S him.
You do it fast, you do it clean.
I know.
And be confident.
You don't run.
Runners call attention.
I know.
You got your glove?
All right.
We're blocked in!
You kidding me?
Goddamn it!
What the fuck are you doing?
You can't be here
all fucking day!
Oh!
Kid always had an attitude.
Wait.
This one'S sharper.
ThankS.
Okay. All right.
This is him.
We have to work
with these people.
You want us to work
with those Irish dogs?
Women, too.
What kind of people
let their women do thiS work?
We agree to a union contract.
It'S not worth going to war.
What about Brooklyn?
- We pay them good money.
- I called.
Do you see them around here?
They take our money.
We never see them again.
Meanwhile, we got bums,
we got drug pushers...
Traffic, garbage.
It'S getting so that they're
leaving us no choice.
There's always a choice.
I think this time, there's not.
Whoa.
- Another.
- You got it, Kathy.
It's on me.
Eight months of work. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hmm.
We had a holdout.
One of the jewelers.
Oh, Christ.
They're fucking.
Mmm-hmm. I could smell it
when I sat down.
No way.
No fuckin' way. Silvers!
- SilverS!
- Yeah.
Hey.
The HaSidic guy killed a few
months back out in Brooklyn?
Ballistics is back.
Same gun used to kill those two
out in Hell's Kitchen
a couple years ago.
The ones found in the dumpster.
Remember? With the...
Come on, man.
How is this Jewish guy
tied into Hell'S Kitchen?
I don't know.
Fucking Irish.
I need the files from June '76,
homicides of William Walsh
and Andrew O'Connor.
You Kathy Brennan?
Who the fuck are you?
Alfonso Coretti
wantS to talk with you.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 10.
Bring the other two girls, huh?
What other two girls?
They said you were smart.
Be smart.
Okay...
Gabriel's got to follow us.
Someone knows
where we are, we'll be okay.
If we get in the car and
go to Brooklyn, we're dead.
If he wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead.
What do you wear
to something like that?
You get dressed up?
You fucking kidding?
No.
What?
Get you girls a drink?
No, thanks.
I'll take a whiskey.
Yeah, me too.
'Course the Irish ones
take the drink.
'Course the Italian one's
a dick.
Now, now, with the name-calling.
Alfonso Coretti.
We don't wanna traffic
in stereotypes, do we, Ruby?
Mrs. Brennan.
Your husband,
he tried to reach out to me
on a few occasions,
but he was never important
enough to be worth my time.
Claire, you're the one I have
to watch out for, aren't you?
Please, I won't bite.
Least not today. Please.
You girls have been very busy.
Maybe the Jews went with you,
because all your womanhood
got under their Skin.
Our Hasidic partners
went with us
because they know good business.
The one you Shot dead
on his stoop,
I bet he doesn't think so.
We don't Shoot people.
That'S your world.
Hmm.
We have
a dick-measuring contest,
I'm gonna win.
You are not fucking
smarter than me.
For what you did to me,
for taking my business...
I am within rights to wipe you
off the face of the earth.
But I won't.
Because we are going to go
into business together,
you and me.
We're fine on our own.
Okay.
And when your husbands get out
in four months,
they're gonna be fine
with the new arrangement
with you being in charge?
Our husbands have 24 more months
left on their sentences.
They're getting out
in four months.
You didn't know?
Well, turns out
I have my fingers
in a few more pies than you do.
So, what do you think, Ruby?
IS Kevin gonna be copacetic
with the new arrangement?
It seems to me,
all your Mick relatives
are gonna turn on you.
Might be a good idea
to have me at your back.
So, if you've got our backs,
how much is that gonna cost US?
You know what's going on
in the rail yards
south of 42nd Street?
Well, south of 42nd Street
is Shaping up to be
a new convention center.
Almost two million square feet.
Biggest construction job
the city's had in years.
They've been talking about it
for 20 years.
Yeah.
Some millionaire's kid.
Little shit-for-brains,
he finally coughed up the land.
It'S happening.
And I want in.
Any work that happens
in our neighborhood
is gonna be for our people.
They say construction's
gonna take five, Six years.
And I want some of my people
to have a chance to
participate in all those jobs.
I want an alliance
with the Irish.
I have to...
I will take what I need.
I don't want to.
I don't wanna fight.
There's room
for everybody, right?
We want more.
32nd up to 59th. East and west.
Do you know what you're asking?
Yeah, I do.
You got our back?
I got every part of you.
Well, I know your guy, Gabriel,
he's waiting outside for you.
He's good for you.
He gives you legitimacy.
Have you given any thought
to what you'd do
if he goes back to Kevin?
Gabriel's with us.
But if he'S not.
If he goes back.
Claire'll put a bullet
in his head.
You girls kill me.
You asked for too much.
I asked for what we deserved,
and we got it.
You know what's involved,
running that much of the city?
You the Irish girls?
Yeah, we the Irish girls.
I'm Maria Coretti.
Good for you.
All Gloria Steinem and Shit.
You give those guyS hell.
Hey.
Don't ever threaten Gabriel
like that again.
Itslocked.
Sorry.
They're getting out
in four months.
We'll use these monthS
to lock it down.
Even our husbands
will never touch us.
For Christ's sake,
I'm not afraid of Jimmy.
We'll see which one of us
is right, won't we?
The more you collect,
the more you make.
I get rich, you get rich.
We're gonna take care
of everybody.
Five years of work is more
stability than we've ever had!
Happy to do it.
Happy to do it. Really.
Thanks, Larry.
Must be proud.
Hey, you Sit.
Let me get you a beer.
Let me get you three,
if you like.
Oh. One's good. ThankS, Scotty.
Have I been unclear about
my feelings for all this?
- I did all this for you.
- No.
You get five years of work.
That's more than you've
ever seen in your whole life.
Every day I did have
was an honest day.
Not like this. Not like you.
So I'm trash, right, huh?
No, you married trash.
He gave you two beautiful
kidS, I'll give you that.
But God knows he wasn't worth
throwing your life away.
I'm not throwing my life away.
I've never felt stronger.
You're a criminal, Kathy.
We didn't raise you like this.
We're good people,
your mother and me.
You brought me up here.
What did you expect, huh?
You could have moved US out
to the Island or to Jersey.
But you didn't,
and you know why?
Because out there,
you're nothing
but an uneducated immigrant
and you can't face that.
Here, you're somebody.
All right, that's enough.
You profited from thiS
like everybody else.
Clean or dirty.
So whatever I am, it's on you.
Make sure She pays you back
for that.
What?
Ten years...
I lived here with him.
But I was alone.
Hey.
You're not alone.
Come here.
Let's get you
out of this apartment.
Okay.
Oh, Iooky here, huh?
How's a man like Sean Duffy
afford a car like that?
Hmm?
I never been in this position
before in my life.
Well, we're happy to help.
You're a credit
to the community.
You done good.
Payment's due on the first,
rain or Shine.
It'S okay.
You know, we're just getting
this loan thing going.
People will take a mile,
if you let them.
He's not taking anything.
He's an old man.
Speaking of old ones,
my mother-in-law
asked me for money.
Wow. That iS nerve.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna enjoy the look on
her face when I tell her no.
MrS. Brennan?
Yeah.
Got those groceries
to your house.
And just collected down
in the 303. Luciano's.
They sent meatballs.
Oh, uh, take them over
to my mother's.
Colin's got a screw loose.
So I'll tighten him up.
I got to go.
Hey, you know,
Grady said that
he turned in his collections,
but I didn't see them.
Some expenses came up. Iusedit
What expenses?
Why are you fucking riding me?
I don't need to Sit across
the table with you.
You and me,
we're never gonna be friends.
Still got to eat.
Yeah. Which one are we going to?
Barutto's. Up ahead.
Kevin ever tell you
about hiS girlfriend Marie?
That was a girl
with a head on her Shoulders.
That why she broke up
with Kevin?
I see you for who you are.
Your own people uptown
don't like you.
I'm opening the door
for my own people.
NiggerS are gonna
come flooding all in here.
Just had to marry the right guy.
He's Sleeping with her again.
Marie.
Behind your back.
They used to meet at
the Travel Inn every Thursday.
Restaurant's just right there.
One door up.
I hope you've had fun.
'Cause when he gets home,
you're done.
He's gonna throw your black aSS
out on the street
where it belongs.
Cut the shit.
You gonna give me my money?
After you.
It'S closed, you fucking idiot!
Restaurants are closed
on Mondays, you fucking idiot.
Thank you for the food
of which we are about
to receive. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
You look pretty, Mama.
Oh.
Pretty doesn't matter.
It'S just a tool women can use.
For what?
For whatever we want.
What do you want?
I want that
when you're in charge,
and you're in charge someday,
that I'll know no one'll
ever meSS with you
because you're my kids.
You see this shit?
Look at it. Look at this.
You see how She's dressed?
All right, that woman
has a sugar daddy
or she's up to something.
Ruby O'Carroll?
No Irishman would ever
give her the time of day.
I've been hearing that
the FedS are back.
Hey, what did Ritchie want?
Just condolences, that's all.
Not exactly dressed

The bitch fell. I'm not sorry.
What happened?
They're getting out tomorrow.

and they serve 16 months.
They get out,

- Good.
Okay, that's it.
We are not gonna rest on this.
We're gonna get them.
Now, look, I'm gonna

You want something?
Mmm-mmm. No. I'm okay.
Okay.
Dad!
Let's go.

Businesses are cooperating.
There's real opportunity there.
We all got to get together.
Get me and the guys

Ah, Jimmy's good.
You know, supportive.
I haven't seen Rob.
But I'm living with Gabriel.
And I'm happy.

Where iS she going?
Hey, yeah, this is
Agent Martinez calling in.
Badge number...
Couldn't you be
a normal motherfucker
and just ask for a divorce?
HaS there ever been anything
normal between us?
You thought marrying me
made you a rebel?
You think it was easy
marrying you?
IS that what you think?
With my ma and all her crazy...
I think you never fucked
a black girl before
and I rocked your world.
Yeah, yeah, I think it...
How many times?
Yeah, I think it was
only three timeS.
Three times?
Yeah.
Three times I came for real.
IS that so?
The rest was just show.
You know,

it don't work on me.
Did you forget I Spit on your
father's grave with you?
I've been inside you, Ruby.
I know you. I know your fear.
You don't know shit.
The only thing black people
need is power.
That way no one
can fuck with you.
And along comes this white boy
that'S so dumb,
he doesn't realize that he's
Sitting on top of an empire
if he'd get out his own way.
You know what?
You can keep the apartment.
I don't even need it.
You got to stay the fuck

Step off my business.
Baby... it's my business now.
You fucking whore.
Get out.
You fucking that fucking psycho?
Rob, I swear. Get out.
What happened here, huh?
'Cause I go away
and everything's fine.
No. It was never fine.
I never fucked around.
The other guys. Not me.
Not me. I'm good.
I'm a good person.
You are a piece of Shit.
And I am done with you.
Yeah, well, you don't

And I only married you
because I had to.

Oh, my God.
Was that Rob?
It waS him or me.
It waS him or me, Kathy.
Kathy... you're not in charge.
Get in.
I thought you ladies Should know

Who put the hit out on us?
Her husband, Kevin.
Uh, me and my boys was in a bar,

You know? And this guy we done

He knows that we are

to put a hit on us.
Oh, I'm Greek.
On my mother's Side.
He's not
an active associate of ours.
How much they offer to pay?
Twenty-five grand
for each of you.
That'S 75.
We'll give you 100
for Duffy, Burns, and Colin.
No. No. Colin iSjust a kid.
He's with them, Kathy.
You know that.
You don't know that.
You clean up our crew.
For three of them, 100 grand.
That'S a better deal.
Plus, another 100 grand.
Fifty grand for my husband.
And another 50 for hers.
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, okay?
Jimmy'S got nothing to do
with this.
Nothing.
Stay away...
Stay away from him.
Have you heard anything
about Jimmy?
You go to war...

We pay you for protection,
not advice.
Get in.
Fuck you, Ruby!
Just got a bad feeling,
you know?
About Kathy and Ruby.
And Kathy...
She didn't even wanna
make this move.
She said Jimmy's not involved.
She said
that kid Colin's not involved.
- Kathy said that?
- Yeah.
Fuck.
She said he was 19.
We Should leave him alone.
Said Jimmy's on our side.
Hey.
Look at me.
Mmm-hmm.
We got this.
What do we got?
We got whatever you want.
What do you want?
- You want the world?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Well, we could go out
and get it, you know?
I already got you a palace.
Right? So, you're welcome.
What else do you want?
We're doing pretty good.
Yeah.
Some messy stuff, right, but...
Yeah, but I'm good
at the messy stuff.
- Yes, you are.
- Mmm-hmm.
I've seen that.
- You're very good.
- Very good at it.
- Terrifying.
- Very good at it.
We're doing so good.
Yeah.
Maybe we should try
and have a kid.
Or something.
Oh, no, no, no, wait, what?
You wanna have a kid with me?
- No.
- Yeah, you do.
That'S what you said. Uh-uh.
- No, I didn't say that...
- No, you can't take it back.
- I said something else.
- No, that'S what you said.
- I didn't say anything.
- YeS.
Why'd you do this, Kath?
What'd you do to US?
No, no! No, you left us.
They would've gone hungry
iflhadnt have done something.
Stop it.
Stop it!
- Duffy!
- Yeah?
Oh...
Colin, let'S go!
Motherfucker didn't even
change the locks after I left.
Five hundred more,

Clean-up's on the house.
Thank you.
Jimmy. Jimmy!
Sal.
Hey, Mrs. Brennan.
I got you all night.
You're good.
- ThankS.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, you got him.
Yeah.

It'S Colin.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No!
Claire.
Oh, Christ. Claire?
Oh, fuck, stop... Claire.
Claire. Claire.
Claire...
Come on. Come on.
Stop it. Fuck! Stop.
No, no, not...
Into your hands, O Lord,
we humbly entrust
our sister, Claire.
In this life you embraced her
with your tender love.
Deliver her now from every evil.
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
on Earth as it iS in Heaven.
Give us this day
our daily bread...
and forgive us our trespasseS
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
In the name of the Father,
the Son...
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Amen.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
We're here for you.
Just give me a minute.
I didn't know
Colin was capable of...
You protected
that piece of Shit.
Well, the question we need
to ask ourselves is...
Are we behaving
according to the way
that society
expects us to behave...
and is that behavior
necessarily good for us...
Ruby and I got some business
over in the Jewelry District.
No fucking way. Mmm-mmm.
Claire iS dead.
I know that.
Rob. Kevin.
Everyone is dead, Kathy.
It'S over now,
so we got to get back to it.
You're not getting back
to anything.
You're out of this. You're done.
- No.
- "NO"?
This is my business.
Oh, come on, now.
I made thiS.
I built something
fucking amazing, Jimmy.
I'm putting people to work.
I'm doing good things
in the community.
I'm supposed to walk away
from that? Why?
Because you've decided that
I can't handle the pressure.
That's not for you to decide.
I was patient with all this.
With you.
Oh, you were patient?
Like you allowed me a hobby?
You girls, you're way worse
than we ever were.
You're way worse.
What do you expect me to do?
You expect me to stay at home
and watch the kids...
while you're out
playing mobster?
It'S fucking bullshit.
The kids are outta school
in an hour!
I have been wiping their asses
Since day fucking one!
I know
when they get outta school.
You want this one?
No. I got
too many like that already.
Listen, if thiS thing's
gonna work,
it's got to be me and you,
50-50.
How's that different than
what we've been doing?
'Cause you're making decisions
on your own.
You're not consulting me.
And we can't go around killing
everybody that pisses you off.
I got a meeting.
- A meeting where?
- Harlem.
What are we gonna do in Harlem?
Oh, we'll be fine in Harlem.
You want a ride?
Oh, my God.
You set them up.
You knew they were gonna hit
that store, didn't you?
Now call, call.
This is Agent Martinez...
[made sure
no one got in the way.
A black girl can't make a move
in the Kitchen.
I needed an Irish girl
to lead the way.
Up to a point at least.
You're the smarter one here.
You sent Jimmy to prison.
FBI! On your knees!
Get the fuck on your knees!
Guess I know
where the money's gone.
You paid him off.
I made an arrangement so that
we can get to where we wanted.
What's your arrangement now?
He's cool.
I keep the gravy train rolling,
and we get everything
we ever wanted.
I meant us.
What is our arrangement?
You like what we built?
I didn't build this.
Good. I'll take it from here.
Mmm-mmm. Hey, handsome.
Hey.
Mrs. Morris,
are Peter and Jennifer
still in the building?
They got picked up early.
Both your kids got called down
to the principal'S office
around 2.
Uh, do you want me to...
Should I call the...
Should I call the police,
Mrs. Brennan?
Hello? Hello?
Hello.
Mrs. Brennan. Alfonso Coretti.
I need you to make a trip
to Brooklyn. Now.
Mr. Coretti, I can't do that.
I can't find my children.
[have your kids, Kathy.
They're safe.
I promise. I'm a father, myself.
Come to Brooklyn.
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.
Oh, my God.
Hey, hi. Hi.
Hi. Hi.
- Hi.
- What happened?
They F us every time.
Every chance they get, dontthey?
Who F's us?
Ma, I know what F means.
They're waiting for you
in the back.
Go.
Go.
I got your kidS.
I got them.
Yeah.
Start from the melody part.
Baby, I didn't mean
to make any trouble.
What's going on?
Your husband, he came to me
and tried to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
To cut you out.
You brought the kidS?
You brought our children to
a fucking meeting in Brooklyn?
I think he thought
it would insulate him.
That I wouldn't do
nothing to a man
in front of hiS own children.
You don't know thiS man.
You don't know that he wasn't
gonna kill them.
Getting outta the joint...
to see you all dolled up.
You're queen of the Micks.
You said you were proud of me.
You didn't make a place for me.
It'S fucking humiliating.
You put your ego
before our children's safety.
Before our
fucking children's safety!
How am I supposed
to trust you again, huh?
After this?
In this business, a man
is only as good as his word.
If I go behind your back,
how does that look?
I got a deal with you, Kathy.
Not with him.
Him... I don't have any use for.
Me, neither.
Kathy.
Kathy!
Kathy!
I'm so sorry, Kathy.
Are the kids okay?
Yeah, your mother has them
downstairs in the office.
Eating snacks.
But, well, you know...
I know what you did.
I don't know...
What do you mean?
Kathy, it's a small town.
I'm proud of you.
I mean, I never understood it
when it was just you
being nutso, you know.
Taking risks for what?
For money.
But your kids?
That'S right.
That'S the right move,
you putting your kidS first.
I would've done the same thing.
I didn't put them first.
I did this for me.
Living all these years,
just thanking people.
Thanking you. Thanking
some man holding the door.
Thanking a priest
for his blessings.
Thanking Jimmy.
Thanking God.
And with all that, I never
walked a day on the streets
without fear.
I never felt safe.
No woman doeS.
Now I do.
I put me first.
And this isn't gonna stop.
This is who I am.
Times change.
You do what you got to do.
Famine. Violence.
You survive.
You gonna point out
how wrong I was?
Over Claire?
Or you giving me shit
about killing my husband?
It'S either gonna be all right
between us, or it's not.
We got an issue
with the deli over on 34th.
Haven't contributed in months.
I'm gonna go pay them a visit.
This conversation isn't good
for either of us.
I'll meet you on 34th
in an hour.
Hello?
Back here.
Why don't you come out here?
I loved her, too.
I loved her more.
Fuck.
I only came back for her.
I know.
Okay.
I'm not begging in front
of your whole family.
I came here
to make you an offer.
I don't trust you.
Well, what do you need me for?
Why don't you go ahead
and just Shoot me right now,
right here?
Yeah, and then what?
Somebody comes along
and killS me?
We worked hard for this.
Okay, we built something good.
Do you wanna go back
to how it was?
You have no idea
what it's like to be me.
I'd rather die than go back.
Good.
'Cause we almost got
Midtown locked down.
Can you imagine what we can do
if we go uptown?
You uptown?
They'd eat your ass alive.
Yeah, I'd like to see you try
to run Hell's Kitchen
without me.
Call them off.
Do we have an understanding?
Any of you need
to talk this Shit through?
Then get the fuck
out of our way.
