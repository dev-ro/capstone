Hey, see you afternoon
Ok
Wait for my return
move it... move it..
Is it back on?
Nope
Check now
Not yet..
P K Kuttappan..
Panachel
Grandpa is in quarantine
My goodness..
Popy -Hey
Vaayu
Look
What's up?
It's just a toy gun
I'll smack you ..
Is this a kid's toy, heh?
My friend Shinto gave it to me
I was just..
..Playing
Don't you have anything to study?
Go, study..
Go home, man
It needs to be returned..
Ask him to get it from me
Dad..
Dad..
Yes
I am taking the pick-up truck
For what?
To buy some straw
Need to put some diesel in it
Take Rs.2000 from the vallet
There is Rs 7500 in it..
Oh..
Hey, Gireesh
Son, go get some straw for
Vayuputran
I have some work at the pond
Why are you taking so long?
He hasn't eaten since yesterday..Go
hmm
Fill diesel for Rs. 1500...
Buy two packs of cigerrettes
and keep the change
Ok
What's for breakfast, Bincy?
Upma and banana
Is this some kind of 'convent'?
Rice will be ready
in a couple of minutes
Ah..super
Bincy..
Oh..
Tell that I left early, if Dad asks
Sure
Here is your coffee
Hey.. Hey
Dad
Lie down there
What the heck did you take
money from my account for?
When?
On last 24th
Didn't you steal Rs 8000 from my account online?
Don't have any idea, I swear
I will die, you have become heavier
Shut up
Dad, please don't hit me
Shut up
Huh...
Don't I look after you
and your skinny horse?
Yes..
Don't I?
Yes..
Then eat, shit ..and
never complain
The horse market is dull..the whole
tourism sector sucks...
Shall pay you back, I swear
You better do, else I'll break your spine
and feed you for the rest of your life
That would be more
cost-effective for me
You second rate loser
Brother
There is too much of mud
The water source seems blocked
hold it tight
Water will be in plenty,
if that stone is blown off
Sudhi, have a look
Hold it together
Might need six crackers
Pull it out, don't bother
about the valve
Hold it from beneath
Pull this out
..now we have learned
about rationals like pie
Here we divide the numbers into
two groups, rationals and irrationals.
So, what are rationals? We might
need them later..let's go over again
2/3 is a rational number
in which..
..Two is an integer
Hey, you call your friend Shinto and ask
how much does that gun cost..
We may buy one
Really?
Yes
There are many types, uncle
What about fully automatic one?
It will be costly
Do we need to buy the
pellets separately?
There is an offer..if we buy now
100 pellets will come
with the gun, free of cost
How much did you pay?
For the gun or pellets?
For the gun
It was Rs.8000 for the gun
So cheap
You must have bought it online, right?
Yes..
Swindling!I
Dad..
Uncle... please...
Where is Dad?
He has gone to the pond
What happened?
Nothing
Uncle..
It's slipping, bro
Hey Suresh
Pull harder
Step aside, boys
Let's move
Beware of sharp stones
Hold up, you asshole
Lift it, pull..pull
Pull it out..
Give it to me I will take care
Can you pull a bit more?
Please, uncle, please
No, Popy, no..
My integrity is at stake here..
Don't tell Grandpa, Please
Do you have the
'power' to stop me?
Dad
Uncle, don't tell him..
Dad
Careful
What happened, brother?
Start the car.
What happened?
Take the car, you asshole.
Dad, let me take the car key..
How is he?
Critical, It was a severe stroke
There is no hope, they say
But do we have an option, but to hope?
Isn't it?
Yes
They are doing everything that
Medical Science can
Get some hot water, I am too tired..
Need to take a shower
There is heater in Dad's room.
I haven't eaten the whole day
Lucky you!
After all, we humans are
helpless, Bincy
Didn't they get some
fish from the pond?
I put it in the fridge..
Let me heat it
Has Dad written any will or something.
Do you have any idea?
Is this the time to discuss these?
When you asked for fish curry,
I thought...
Hi Roy..
Who is this?
It's me Felix
Oh..mate..
How is your clinic going?
It's good
He is my distant relative
Kuttappan P K
Yes
How is he?
Still bleeding, can do a burrhole
How did it happen?
What to say? He was pulling out a valve from a pond
At this age!
How is he now?
Felix bro has come
He is talking with the Doctors,
they were classmates
Have you had anything?
- No
Haven't you brought something?
- Yes
Yes, shall we move to the canteen or so?
Jomon..
Yes, brother
They say, he'll get better..
But from what I saw
I don't have much hope
Shall we shift him to some where else?
Where to?
It's all the same everywhere
Look brother, can he sign some cheques?
Can't run anything with out..
Look Jaison
Even if he regains consiousness
how can he sign with a paralysed arm?
Can we take thumb impression?
You all could end up in jail, mate
He will kill me if I fail to send the load
Oh my God
Bincy
The new horse deal is about
to close, a real good one
That's great
Can't celebrate yet..broker is not happy
with the place he is kept
It would have been 'royal' if we
can keep him in our court yard
Dad will break my knee, if I do
However, that's not an issue now
Anyhow, let me call brother Jomon
Joji..
Hey Joji..
It's your house too..why would
you ask for permission?
Just take him to the courtyard
and tie him there
Joji, what's the matter?
Jomon bro, I shall call back, busy now.
Who was it?
Joji
What?
Said he is busy and will call later
Heh.. Such a slothy dude!
Don't come near him..
Oh my...
- Vaayu....
Stay there
Cover picture looks great
The deal was closed
on that looks only
It would have sucked,
had he been kept in these rubber woods
Unlock from above
Sister make way
Com'on, careful
Don't hold the sheet
Lift
Gireesh... slow down
Look for the steps
Where is the room?
It's upstairs
Why don't we lay him downstairs?
No, he would be happier upstairs
Let's take him there..
Be careful
Mind his arm
Careful with the arm
His arm.. Lift
and turn... that's it
Hold him
That's enough..
Kuttappan brother
are you ok?
We are home, everybody is here
Just blink, if you are ok
There you go..
He is crying..
Hey..he is not,
a little flow is just normal
What are you all staring at?
Now you may leave ..
Bincy...
where is the discharge summary?
I will get it now
Bincy...
this one in the morning,
and...
Just a moment..
Joji
Do you have any change?
Don't you have fifty or hundred?
Give it to him
Thanks
Ok then
What is this, man?
Why are you tipping 500 rupees
for a 2000 rupees ride
It's for our Dad, right?
Isn't there any value for money
Jaison..
Yes, brother
He was far better at the hospital..
Here it seems ..
Panachel Kuttappan's gone..
This is not our Dad ..
Then who is it?
I will tell you something
In the coming days we
should make our Dad happy...
We should work tirelessly for it
and pray as well..
Today onwards there will be
evening prayer at this home at 8, I will lead
Close your rubber shop before that..
Are we clear?
Joji, heard it?
Popy
It was mainly for you
Where would I go?
That's it, you should be here
So, whats the plan for now?
I'm thirsty
Don't you have any bottle?
I have an opened bottle of MH
What about you?
I have some Vodka..not much is left in it
Don't you have better ones?
There must be bottles in his cabinet
Here?
Yeah
Bincy..
- Oh
Ah..Whats up?
Any new projects?
Just sold off a horse...
Good
Dad, let me take a bottle
Jomon... good night, then
I've to go to the clinic tomorrow and the
day after..
I shall bring the priest on Sunday
Where is my car?
Brother, don't drive in this condition..
I will drop you...
Hey Jomon, don't under estimate me
I can drop you, if needed..
Heh..hheh..
Joji, please drop our Felix bro home..
Brother..we are home
Ah..
Good..
Brother..
Let me ask frankly..
How long will Dad live?
To be frank...
Won't cross this fortnight
Good night...
..you..millionaire

Jesus, our creator, Lord and
saviour...
..all these happened when
he lived among us
We also believe; therefore,
we also speak.
Father, Dad is showing restlessness
Friend, it's quite normal
This is a confession before the God..
Of our Father's sins, it's not easy..
Restlessness is normal
But, I can't watch it
like this anymore
What's your name, again?
Jomon
Jomon
What you need to do now is, step aside,
close your eyes and pray for your Dad..
Jesus sent out these twelve with
the following instructions
Don't go among the Gentiles
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers
Raise the dead, drive out demons...
- Father
Freely you have got; freely give.
Do not get any gold or silver to take
with you in your belts
Bless me, O Lord
Peace be upon you
Father..
- Mr Jomon, don't you understand my words?
Wise people should normally get it
Is there no one to make him understand?
Look at Dad..
Come here
Everybody listen
This is to atone the sins which might
have been committed by our Father
Anointing oil prayer is a sacrament
passed on to us by our holy fathers
Nobody has the right or power to
interrupt it mid-way
Even if our Father departs us during this,
consider it as God's will
There is no farewell more blessed
and peaceful than this
All the children of God gathered here
may close their eyes and pray for him
We are entering the most important part..
Dad will die lying there
Felix -There is nothing to be done, believe me
Fr Kevin -I put my hands on every ..
Fr Kevin -I apply anointing oil and pray...
Felix -It's time for him to go
..pray for his atonement
- You pray... pray
Father, son and holy...
- No, I can't allow this..heh!
Hold him Jaison
Step off
Joji take him
You cannot abruptly stop it..
This tea is not sweet
- From the coffee machine, isn't it?
Shall we re order?
- No
Look, this surgery thing is a scam.
They'd even suggest a head transplant
Do we have an option, bro?
I think it's waste of money, 10-15 lakhs
But, it is good for public opinion
That is also important
Don't bother about money now
Did you ask Joji's opinion?
For what?
How do you manage the OTP?
It's sent to Dad's number, right?
Can do it when Grandpa goes to the
bathroom but we should be alert..
Why?
Just..you know
Yes, uncle
Hey Son...
How is Dad?
He is fighting,
but we can't
predict the result
Don't worry, he will recover soon
I'm sure
Nobody has hope in surgery,
but could we look the other way?
Sure..we should be hopeful,
I just wanted to get a clear picture..
Do I have to book the tickets now?
Or else...
Fare is too high now
Mmm..
Uncle..tickets...
- Just for a clarity
Ok..start searching
Wish he does not suffer
Absolutely, that's just it
Uncle, I've a call from the hospital..
Hold on
shall get you the final picture
Hello
Joji, are you at home?
Yes, tell me frankly
The surgery is over,
he is showing good progress
He has regained conciousness
Doctor says everything is fine
Inform Bincy too
Yeah
- ok
Uncle
- any updates
everything looks good
Dad is ok
So, no need of a ticket now
God's grace
Yea, yea
Ok then
Brother
O Lord..
Mind his leg
...careful
Ok
Alright?
- Yes
Slowly
Jaison, please come
Kuttappan sir..
Enough?
Uncle
he is back
Are we in trouble?
I am not, perhaps you are..
Popy, I have some important works,
If you don't mind give me some privacy
Go away..
Uncle...
This is the right time
As he works like a dog
Jaison bro has all the right to ask..
Dad has lost his sight
the whole wiring has gone
this is the best time to ask
Bincy is this some new technology?
Step aside
As per the bank
If you authorise
I can sign the cheque on your behalf
You don't need to suffer...
Kuttappan sir, well done
Doctor said, he should be encouraged
You go downstairs
And...
We are in need of cash
Had to break Bincy's fixed deposit
to handle the crisis
We have seen a flat in the town
It's near the clinic
where we consult
If you have something in mind
for us
That will prove helpful
We have already paid
the advance amount
Jaison, my son..
So, my sons made this plan expecting
me to die
But hard luck this time
Do one thing now
This fan is too noisy
Fit an air conditioner in the room
Ok
You may go
What happened?
We won't get a penny when he is alive
See this... his perfect signature,
That too in a few days after the surgery
I've been trying to do this
since my 10th grade
Bincy, do not send me upstairs
with these kind of stupid ideas
It was such a humiliation
Bincy, get me some cold water
Joji, it's in this fridge
You can open
it from where you sit..
Water bottles are here
Take it by yourself, and drink
What happened, Bincy?
Did he talk to Dad?
Our plan will never, ever work, Joji
He is running on drugs
Won't last long
Take it easy
Your good days will be wasted
on this kitchen slab
Dad..
Dad..
Mmm?
Let me say it to your face
All of us have issues
Nobody talks because of the fear,
love and respect towards you
You came back from the death bed..
Didn't you see death up close?
Life is just like that, anybody
could get the call any day
We will look after you, that's what
you want, right?
Trust us
Dad..
You always say that I am second piece
You are right ..I am
I could never be the son you desired..
Could'nt even be the one I wanted to be
It's only the matter of one click, Dad
I will prosper
Everybody will prosper
Trust me, please..
Dad, my youth is being fu**ed up
Nobody takes anything with them
in the final journey...
Come on, let's go out in the sun
Kuttappan sir
Keep squeezing this ball
Let me eat something
- Mmm
Who is there?
One of the subjects of your kingdom
Go..go away
It's been a couple of days..right?
Any luck?
I am just..
It will surely bite

Brother, there is an issue
- What is it?
Jomon bro has gone off the track
He wants to burst crackers
when the body is taken for burial
You please come
- Where is he?
He is there
It would have been better
if we got bigger ones
Look Jomon, people
will make fun of us
I think this is not enough
What nonsense are you doing?
Bro, Dad had told us not to cry
when he dies, right?
Didn't he ask us to
burst crackers too?
Even those card players in the
farther estate should know...
..about Panachel Kuttappayi's
last journey
What a power it would be!
He might have told many things while drinking
You don't have to take all of it seriously
Haven't you heard him telling it?
Yes I have
- Then that's it
People will say
that you are crazy
You please listen to me
We are not doing this
Listen..
Only a single row..
Please

Brother... brother..
The Father might act cold, I am afraid
I will do all the talking, you keep mum
Are you drunk?
Heh?
Have you had liquor?
A little, for the sake of a meeting
I thought you were much younger..
Couldn't assume your age
Would you have shown more
respect if you knew my age?
Father, we are planning to have
Dad's service next Friday
Given the situation, we aren't inviting
many..
...Shall send the car by morning
I shall come
But you should promise me that nothing
untoward, like earlier, would happen again
Do you mean the first incident
or the second one?
I am a nobody,
just a worm..
You may ignore me..
But like the manual we get with all appliances,
Yes, father
Bible is the manual for us Christians
We know that, Father
We should obey and respect it
I will come only if you ensure this
Sure...
Sure Father
You're new here and might not have noticed
There is a board under the church's flag pole ..
..Which reads, 'sponsored by
P K Kuttappan Panachel'
If you can keep off from his
service, good luck with it...
Let's go
Give me a minute
Stop pleading and come
Father, don't feel bad, you know..
Most families have that black sheep
Is he drunk?
He is divorced
and has taken refuge in Brandy,
after Dad's death
Guessed that much
Don't keep this in mind
Please come for the service
You may go
Will he come, the Father?
If he has some dignity, he won't.
Anything more to wash?
No, that's it
Do not mix the coloured
and white ones in the machine
Brother Jomon might not need the
Church and chaplains...
But that's not our case... we have to
run the business here
When Dad was around, we had to
fear him only.....
now it's like..
Think of some solution rather
than the problems
Joji, It's hard to get along with
drunkards like him
No need...
We can do the partition and live as we want to
Ask brother Jaison to talk to him
We can sit together ASAP
I do not think brother Jomon
would come to the table
If he doesn't come our way,
we should go his..
Get two bottles..
How about it?
Are you coming straight from the clinic?
- Yes
Things should be sorted out,
smoothly, thats all
You guys need not talk much
I will deal it
Here he comes, shall I fix the drink?
Why not?
What happened, Jomon?
Are you on some fasting?
Nothing like that,
Let the discussion be over
Else I will be blamed for tanking it..
The drink can wait
He has a point..
It's better not to
mix drink with discussion
Joji, keep it there and sit
Jomon
even though it was
not to happen this soon,
..brother Kuttappan had a
plan for the partition
He had discussed it with me,
but I am not disclosing it here..
If I do, tomorrow, I will be
accused of bias, even by you
Dear brother, I have no plan for this
nor have any qualms if we get lesser share
If Dad had any such plans,
you spell it out
That can wait...
if you guys have any
plans we can discuss it here
Jomon... Jaison..
Even Bincy can tell her opinion
Look, I have a plan..
..But it's very basic.
- You stop
Brother Felix won't come with out plan
in his mind
let him speak first
Alright...
let it be ..
I am ready to
do it for brother Kuttappan
Going by conventions,
the estate will go to Jomon
Shop and the property in Mundakkayam
for Jaison
..then, as the youngest son
Joji will get
this house and sorrounding compound
If it goes slightly uneven
we can make
it right with other small properties around
Besides, he has some
bank balance too
And then,
the FD in the Canara bank-
he wished to give it to Popy
That's it..I was just saying
Decision is yours
The greed we are showing now
Dad's spirit will be watching
No issues, let him watch it
How do you think things are
managed here?
I am working like a dog
for years now
Nobody is belittling your effort,
but don't boast about it
I too have done a lot for Dad
If you have toiled, you got rewarded too
How much did he spend for your divorce?
Jaison, dear,
I didn't know that you
were keeping an account book
Yes I do,
I have written down everything correctly
that's what
my Dad taught me
I do not have any shame in it
Don't raise your voice, sit
- Brother
The family members are getting a chance,
for the first time
let them speak out.
That's we are here for, Let's talk
There is nothing to talk, brother.
Even if my son and I don't get anything
no partition is happening right now
Let the death anniversery be over
Brother, a word please
You should understand something.
I am bearing the
whole expense of this house
I had to break Bincy's FD and even
roll money from somewhere else
I had to pay even for
your fire crackers
Now the church goers and neighbors
are blaming me too
That's what I am saying..
People blame us even
for bursting a string of crackers...
What would they say if we partition just
after his death?
They won't hesitate to accuse us of
murdering our Dad for his property..
There's nothing unusual in it.
When wealthy
men die, people do gossip
There's something exiting for them in it..
We just ignore them
Brother, do you know what
our priest that lil' dwarf
He said in the sermon that we were partying
with crackers to celebrate Dad's death
Some other rascals
find fault with us for not
conducting autopsy on Dad
That's a fact...
it has been a talk
for some days now
Look, wasn't he showing signs
of recovery by then?
Let's leave it, Uncle.
We should not talk
about it even among us
- That's right
This is how it becomes a gossip
No.. Sis,
such a talk is already
out there..I hear it often
I am leaving, you
continue the discussion
Look, Jaison..There is enough and more
money in Dad's account
take it, everything will be fine
It's complicated..
There are lots of
formalities, will take time
I have Rs 3 lakhs with me
You can use it for the time being
Got it from that horse deal..
So it's ours
I did lend it from Dad
That will not be enough..
Don't we need to move forward?
There is no change in plans,
You are getting
the Mundakkayam property
Let's think of the formalities to run it
The plantation goes to you, brother Jomon
There will be no change in
brother Felix's plan ...
We shall wait till the anniversery
to execute this
that's it
Let it go like this..
They can live
here even though the house is mine
What do you think, Jaison?
If everything goes fine, I am ok
There will be no issue
I am not sure whether that Priest
would come for the service
You should stop these
drunken banters
What am I doing wrong?
I am reflecting
what the public says
Brother
My decision has nothing to do with the
public. I don't care what they say
But your words, that our Dad is
watching our greed,
That touched me
So, let things go like this
what do you think?
Ok? - Why not?
Then flip the glass, pour a drink
Come sit here
Joji, you did well..
I never expected
this from you..good
All of you showed the qualities of
brother Kuttappan, very good.
We only had 2 acres of land
when our father passed
Now my brother and I have
four law suits between us
Dear believers..
May the good God bless
all of those who shared the grief...
..of this family and prayed for them
for the last forty days
Christians generally have the maturity to
distinguish between practice & malpractice
We saw other communities fight to protect
their tradition right even in our junction
I would say,
By bursting crackers
and shouting when our Father's dead..
..We are demeaning our own heritage,
which is not a noble deed
If someone responsible from the family
could step in and express gartitude..
..We can wind up the function
and and have food
We are happy that everbody came here
despite it being a bad time
I express my gratitude on
behalf of the Panachel family
Many rumours about our
Father's death are doing rounds
There are many who say that bursting
crackers was against the tradition
Some even say that we were
celebrating by bursting crackers
Let me be clear ..
We are ready take on them
physically and legally
Be it the gossip mongers in the toddy shop
or the sweet talkers of the clergy house
Jomon's manual is his conscience
Now all of us can have
food and disperse
Thank you
Let's have food then
Hey hey hey...
I shall serve..
I have already served
Father needs special serving
Have two more eggs
Have it.... Father
Come here..
Have it, Father
Come here..
Father is tired after service
Let him eat
Uncle should ask him
Come here..
What are you doing?..
There is nobody to serve
You do nothing, keep it there
keep it there
Sit there..
Sit
Didn't I plead you not to do this?
People should have a
minimum level of sanity
Is it a crime to serve a Priest
with some eggs?
Is it?
How much did you drink?
Jomon, this is no joke
This laugh will vanish if Father's
body will be dug out from his grave
What has he done?
It was dumb,
Fr.Kevin is very influential
That's true
I don't understand
what his problem is?
He is the main supporter of all
the gossip mongers.... Shhh
Who is that?
- It's me Gireesh
I am coming
What?
The egg curry is inside
There is a WhatsApp group..
Which is the breeding ground of gossipers
When he foul mouths us coming right here,
- The priest didn't eat anything
Isn't it my duty as a son to protest?
Tell me..
That Father walked out
with out having food
- What?
He did not have food
That's what I said..
- I am happy..
Eldest son! Phew.. You're trying to dig
Dad from the grave
Let them dig him out,
and examine
If they find nothing, I will...
This is not any love for Dad,
he only wants to keep drinking
He is nothing but an alcoholic..
Mere alcoholic
He is sick, needs treatment..
No wonder that your
wife dumped you... You
His condition was exposed
in front of all
that's why
Take it easy
Got up early?
I dreamt about Dad
The dead will never return
But beware of those who are alive
Is it caused by lightning?
I will take care of it
Ok..Ok..
Bincy,
Do you know where
Joji was when Dad passed?
Can't recollect anything from that day
It was utter chaos then
Only thing I remember is the hardship
to take him downstairs, thanks to you guys
Hey
What is it?
Did you smoke near the pond yesterday?
Seems there was some fire..
I didn't. I go to smoke by the canal
Mmm..
What a small room this is!
Why don't you sleep at Dad's room
Oh..Let the anniversery be over
I had been slightly off yesterday
Not slightly
You were right,
alcohol is the problem
Good for you if you realise that
Don't act dumb like this
Look dear, Dad was recovering, no?
Yet he's gone
I totally lost it
You don't keep it in mind
Look, that 'Thotta' Sudhi was
your classmate, right?
Which one?..
Oh him!
I think so..
He stabs from the back..
As if it is his Dad, who had died
I'm gonna hold him by his balls
and ask about what he is saying..
Then I will thrash his pulp out..
You are being stupid
If you have an issue with some one..
- Listen asshole, its not about me but you
What?
Where were you when Dad passed?
He claims that when they came running
hearing Bincy's scream
you were coming from
the rubber woods 'in slow motion'
Me?
How is it,
can you see it coming around?
What kind of people are they?
Unbelievable
If they spread these kind of stories
about a blanket boy like you...
..what won't they say about me
who flexes muscles all the time
Society is a f***er, bro
Of course
I will get him, anyway
Brother, call me if you get him
- Sure..
Ok..ok
He is in the east canal, come..
Sure..
Air gun? ..
No need of it, Come
If it's violence, let it be...
Stay there
I got gun powder with me
You asshole..
- Joji..Hey
What is it?
What the f*** did you say? Was I walking in 'slow motion'
when my Dad died? -Hey Joji...
..heh! What did you say?
Weren't you fishing in the pond?
What if I did fish, asshole?
Wasn't it drained recently?
He was fishing in the fishless pond..
That's what I..
Don't you dare lying about me?
You're a
dead man, if you mess up with Panachel family
Go away..
- Brother Jomon..
How dare you come for our family?
Run..You, low life..
Brother, don't let this pig
set foot in our compound anymore
Jomon brother, he's raking up non issues.
I saw you that day and you know that
Making up stories..you
Your mother's pineapple
Get lost, you..
Get lost...
Scoundrel..... Classmate....
Come on, brother
Let's go..
What's it brother?
Why did you go to that fishless pond?
I went there to smoke, and..
The fishing rod was there, I just..
Didn't you tell me that
you used to smoke by the canal?
Is it?
Why do you lie?
What's the matter
What are you hiding from me?
Brother I can explain
- Tell me....
Leave me brother
Leave me... leave me
Spit it out
Don't trust the society
Leave me..
- What are you hiding?
I will die, brother
What are you hiding?
I will die...
Brother..I will die
This is what happens
if you mess with me
Brother was in pursuit of him
through the canal
When I came after parking scooter
Jomon brother was yelling at him
Then he shrugged and ran..
Suddenly I heard
a thunder-like sound
There was a tremendous force in the air..
Dust was all over there
I saw brother's leg
I can't usually stand seeing people fighting.
I will start shivering
Although I was scared,
I accompanied him to avoid any trouble.
He was really violent
Was he drunk?
Of late I was unable to make it out
Joji...
Have you given the same
version of events to the Police?
Yes
- Oh..
Is there any problem, brother?
Not a problem,
but..
The case would have been solid, if you told
them that you saw him throwing it
I couldn't, brother
Don't know whether he threw it
or brother stepped on it..
..Not sure ...could have been
accidental too..
Wouldn't he too get hurt
if it was an accident?
Sam is the Circle Inspector, right?
Yes, of Medayil family
He was extremely sensible,
Inquired about the back ground of both of us
He understood everything
He is an upright officer
not corrupt..
His family is traditionally very rich
- Of course
We can trace Sudhi if needed
He was a good guy
We sat on the same bench in school
Not that sweet anyway
He is one of them
if we say something,
the case will take an ugly turn
Should we investigate ourselves
We can search if needed
Leave it to the Police
- Yeah
Don't cause difficulties
The gunpowder he possessed is illegal,
That's why he is hiding
We can enquire
Even though, should n't we
make some inquries
Sunny, is PC there?'
- Yes in Trivandrum
Is he available over phone?
- There is an info that he is in Koruthod
Then, call Inspector Sam and pass the info
Please, please....
Please, understand our situation
Our Dad passed first,
now brother Jomon too
None of us are as powerful as them
We don't have the strength either
The family is in deep crisis, Father
Popy is there,
he has nobody left
We have to look after him
I understand your emotions
I know how you have rooted for the family
We won't forget it
in fact we are grateful to you
We don't want any fight..
We are tired
I have not slept for..
Felix bro, can you give me some medicine?
I can't stand this
Joji, You find a girl to marry..then the
problems would go away
What are you talking about?
Is it the time for a marriage proposal?
He should marry
Joji..
Don't worry
Of late your family was drifting away
from God's proximity
Consider this as a reminder..
Repent and come back to his path,
He will lead you from there
Be brave..
Don't worry
Did you talk to sister in law?
Does she show any interest in Popy?
Dear Jaison
When I requested her to come
and see him for one last time.
..She said that there
is nothing left for her to see.
What should I have said?
I have only one regret..
I was the one who poured
the first drink to him
We must have shown a little
more concern on him
I am trying hard to hold myself together
If you lose control, I'll break down
Where are you going?
Popy is alone, I shall sleep there
That's nice of you
Popy
- Mmm..
Son..
You will grow fast..
Go out to study,
You will start living alone..
You should give me a promise..
That wherever you go,
you won't touch alcohol
Jomon murder prime suspect
'Thotta Sudhi' surrendered
Need to discuss a matter
Come on in, sit
Look,
that Totta Sudhi has surrendered
He is singing many stories
including that it was you
What else could he say?
What option does he have?
I won't be shattered anymore..
I have a boss now
I shall report there
I wont fall, either
Look..
Ok, then
No, tell me..you had some thing to
Nothing
Say it
We will talk later
- No, say it now, no issues
It's nothing
Do you think that I did it?
Did I say so, asshole?
If you can give that
3 lakhs any soon...
it's very tight now
It's in my account
I will transfer it
Will transfer
- Mmm
Think straight, you asshole
Think straight
Bincy..
- Mm
Did you notice anything strange in Joji?
He looked weird, holding a bible
Hasn't he witness brother's murder?
He will be far from normal
Mmm
Who is it?
Brother Felix
Brother..
Things are getting little complicated
What happened?
There is an inside info on the forensics
- Mmm
They have some doubts
- Hmm
The Police may come tomorrow
Oh God
Don't worry, All of us are with you
Police may summon us
Be cautious
Didn't you sleep?
Police might come tomorrow
Let them, Bincy
My only prayer is that you be
in the clear in brother Jomon's death
Don't bullsh**..
I won't think
you are my sister in law
I will punch your teeth off
I can't handle it alone
Be calm..all of us are with you
You please be here, when the Police comes
I will come after closing the clinic
Do we need to call the Priest?
No need..you sleep now, Good night
Goodnight
They have recovered
airgun pellets from his body
He was shot, they say
What a crucifixion this is!
Joji's version didn't have
any of these
Jomon murder, airgun pellets found from body in autopsy
Why are you sitting here?
I was asked to ..they are
discussing something there
Ok..you sit
He is coming
What's the matter?
You wait in your room
I will call
What's the matter?
Have you heard about bullets
being found in his body?
Is it?
Where is my gun, Uncle?
It will be some where ...
I see, we could land in trouble if the
Police knows about it, right?
I did not think that way
We will find it
Dad's country gun also should be
stashed some where
The Police will be waiting for something
Leave it there
Have anybody thought
that Sudhi had a gun?
Brother Jomon was right
Somebody is working against us
It was me who dropped him at the east canal
He didn't have any gun on him
He might have stashed
in his waist, you ..
Brother, don't try to play games,
we too have common sense
Why did you do it,
that's the only question remaining
Yes your honour
as if you are the Judge!
Get lost. You asshole
Brother, do I need to convince
someone like him
Heh?
Why are you looking at me?
Why do you stare at me?
First of all sent them out
Brother Jomon was killed by one of them
Why are you staring?
Get lost
Let them stay..Joji
Now we are slightly afraid of you
Brother..
Don't test me brother..
You did not have
any issues till yesterday
Do you think I can kill someone?
It was a toy gun, brother
No it was not..
It's fatal in close range
Popy..
What are you
talking about, Son?
Let them test these pellets..
Then the truth will come out
Everything happens for the good..
Let the Police come
But, I don't deserve this
You all will regret..
All of you
Joji..
Stop the charade
Brother, a word please
Come with me... Please..
What's it?
Yes, I killed brother Jomon
.. And Dad too
Bincy knew most part of it
Look Brother..
When Police comes
I will say three of us
were in collusion
..and the cash I gave you
was to hide the fact
I don't give a sh** if you think this is
blackmail..
This is my reality
You should stand with me..
Or else everyone goes down with me
Joji, I won't stand with you even
if you threaten to slit my throat
You too had wished
to see your Dad dead
Dying declaration
Wait Gireesh
Let the Police come
If he can talk
we have to bring the
Magistrate here to take the statement
We can expect only slightest of body
movements, say the eyes..
Is he asleep...
He was awake minutes ago..
Joji, open your eyes,
Son..Joji...
Joji, it's me..the Doctor
That's it..
Look who has come..
Somebody has come to see you
Blink if you can see us..
Just a blink, if you can see us..
There you are.. He can see us..
Oh..very good
DySP sir has come to see you
He has something to ask
Joji, son..
What to do now?
You didn't die..
So, it's trouble for you
and us as well
What do you have to tell us?
Do you have a confession to make?
Do you get him?
Do you remember anything?
Do you confess to what you did?
Please blink, if you do
- Nope he won't
- He is stubborn
