do, when you enter.
You must have been
thinking about it.

Then, do not mistake.

meet someone Friday morning?
I do not like
that anymore.
I'll double the price. You
can do whatever you want.
I hear you.
I think the guy at the hotel is someone
you do not want to look in your eyes.
It's probably the old man with the
big house you want to move in.
An old guy... He does not like
how you are running the business.
- Fuck you. I can find someone else.
- There is no other.
You call me when
nobody else wants.
Do you want to leave everything?
This is the chance.
You have a Cadillac.

He has a girlfriend
with him. She let you.
Got something to me?
From your
son-in-law.
Shit.
I asked my daughter not to marry
that shit. She did not listen.
They give me six months.
If you want to have him away
so quickly as possible, you say.
- Who the hell are you?
- Will you not remember?
Do you know of Walpole Island? It is a
Indian reserves. My grandmother lives there.
She is a medicine-woman.
She tried to make me one.

- Blackbird...
Now remember you. Brothers Dega.
One died when he was working for you.
Shot in the hospital. The
second sits inside for life.
I am the only one left.
- Can she make you a "Owl"?
- If she wants it.
I may need that kind of woman.
I would like to be
dressed. Is it okay?
Whatever you want.

- Not yet.
You can use it to a
hobby or a TV room.

So practical, yet so elegant.
Thank you very much.
Do not worry about

When I get paid for my last
job, perhaps I can get instead.
- You can sell it as it is?
- No, fix it and live here.
A guy like you? One who is familiar with
city life? There is nothing for you here.
I can always be a friendly
indian, as you. Maybe a guide?
- You had not liked it.
- Why not?
Come on. Are you saying
that I can not live here?
Do you want to go in the Cadillac?
We drive to Algonac and a beer.
Go you. I need to get home.
I dropped not in myself.
Which is rather strange.
I started. Thought leave
hunting stuff for you.
The weapons, I understand, but why a
costume? Are you going to rob a bank?
Can I make a few of
things for next time?
It smells a bitch.
When is the next time?
Tomorrow after work?
- What happened to the 315 Jefferson?

I said no. It is an old work.

- Do Tangelwoods home quickly?
- It does. Let me tell...
- It is certainly faster on the fire.

It is only to tear a
little. It can happen again.
Or you can pay, for
it not to happen.
- I do not...
- Generate 20,000 so do I get it.
Have you not when I come,
are you dead. Be ready.
You do not know when
I get up. Or who I am.
I'll tell you one thing. Remember
you a guy who worked in Port Heron.
- As was murdered last year.
- I have probably read something about it.
That was me. 20000 when I come,
otherwise, you're a dead agent.
- You owe me money.
- It is only your imagination.
- Who told you to kill the girl?
- She saw my face.
Who the hell cares! She worked for
me! You should listen to me, you idiot.
You are dead. I do not care about you
shot your brother in drunk. You are dead...
That is a cool car.
- I'm looking for a ride.
- Good luck.
You say: "Which way are you
on?" I say: "Which way I want. "
Do not worry, I will not hurt
you. I need the car for one thing.
I used to rob banks.
270,000 is my best.
This time has I
something larger going on.
- You have india blood, right?
- Sufficient to operate a casino.
- Do you have a cool name?
- A cool name?
"Red Elk" or "Running
With the Wolf?"
Blackbird.
It is pretty cool.
My name is Richie Nix,
if you have heard of me.
It is not spelled
as Stevie Nicks.
Turn left here there.
Okay, give me your wallet.
- What are you doing?
- You want my wallet.
Nice and easy.
- The company I used to work for.
- What they distributed?
Peperoni.
They give you a Cadillac.
What are you doing?
I shoot people. Sometimes
for money, sometimes not.
I told you about Elmcostationen I
robbed some time ago, in Port Heron.
I told him I had to shoot
someone, so now he is afraid.
20000 or you're dead. I heard shake
your phone in your hand on him.
Frighten someone
enough, he pays.
A frightened man, do
not know what you think.
You do not duck too much.
Let them know what you think.
You want to surprise them.
Do you have something to take
with you? A suit or something?
That is why I need a partner,
I do not have time for details.
- Have you worked with someone before?
- My brothers.
One sits in prison. My
little brother is dead.
He was stupid.
Blackbird, how sounds 10000?
- It called my little brother to me.
- Okay, we have an agreement?
I told you you would not
know who I was. Remember?
- On your phone?
- You want to talk to anybody down there.
- See this? He plays stupid?
- He fuck with you.
No, he means that he does not believe in it
you said in the phone. Show what you mean.
Do I understood? Give me the money,
otherwise, you're a dead agent.
Okay, you win.
They are in the car.
Welcome to Nelson
Davies agency.
Do you own this company and
still running around in a pickup?
Who the hell is Wayne?
- We prefer.
- What is going on here?
Forget it, we go.
Lock the door and
call the police.
For a job. Nelson
knew that I would.
It was hardly a meeting. His wife said
employee and Wayne would look over.
- Hence the suit.
- Are you a welder?
- I look at other jobs.
- It is a foam time to appear on.
- Lunch. There is no one here then.
- I was here.
- The window, injuries...
- You did not know these guys?
- No one saw you show up separately.
- Wait a minute. They shot at my husband.
- He probably saved me.
- Did you feel the extortion calls?
- I am not aware of any calls.
- Who calls?
There were some calls last
week. I told the police.
But not for us? They
had weapons, Nelson.
Asshole.
I bleed something kopiöst. We go to
Marine City, I want to meet Donna.
- Who the hell is Donna?
- A woman I live with.
My brothers and I came
here once, to kill somebody.
- What had he done?
- I did not ask.
That, I do not understand. I must
be really pissed off to kill someone.
Why did you not him? He
was indeed in the window!
The only time you pull up your
gun is when you kill someone.
It's the same with a hunter. A guy
who knows what he is doing, not shoot...
...if he thinks he'll miss.
Then you must locate the animal
and finish the job. Two pieces.
Are you talking about
woman? What did she do?
She saw my face.
You do not leave things undone if you
think that you will not be remembered.
- Someone looking for you this morning.
- What people?
- They said they were your friends.
- What you told them?
That I had not
seen you in years.
You see my friend's face,
Lionel? Fell from a ladder.
He could not go to work. I said
we could draw and hunt ducks.
Are you free?
It will be bad weather.
We go anyway.
Richie has never seen one.
Come on, Lionel.
This does not take long.
Are you okay?
Probably. Indianer
scared the shit out of me.
What different jobs
are you looking for? You
said you were looking
for jobs to the police.
I'm looking for anything. I am a
dinosaur, according to you. Change or die.
- I have not said.
- When I say it.
So today did you decide to
applying for a job in real estate.
- I can sell a house.
- Absolutely.
Thank you, because
you showed up in costume.
A hazard suit.
- Marry me in, was fire in it.
- You look nice in it.
- In all the cases. Thank you.
- At any time.
It is a deer. Get some rest.
Do you need anything,
may call Hillcrest Motel.
- I do not see any birds.
- Do you want to hunt ducks?
You look towards the sky.
- It looks different. All the water.
- You might not like this went far enough.
Here there are
no dogs and cats.
Last time I saw you, would you
hunt with a guy in a welding jacket.
Seemed like a nice guy.
What was his name?
Can not remember the rest, we go
and ask your wife and daughter.
- Wayne Colson.
- Where does he live?
Is he married?
- Children?
- They could not.
You seem to have problems with
this. He might shoot the wrong bird.
What does it mean?
Ducks land in trees.
Why do not we go in there?
Stretching your legs.
Would you like to go first?
You make me really angry!
Says that ducks do
not land in trees.
I know that ducks
do not land in trees.
Will you, Bird?
Excuse me.
This is my home.
- There is a cave.
- It was the most brazen.
This is Bird. He will
live here for a while.
- What happened?
- I got in fights. Do we have any beer?
You can get something
to eat, so I get some.
- Don't call me Bird longer.
- What should I call you?
My name. Armand.
Are you serious?
When she makes so much noise, means
that she is pissed. Go in there -
and give her a pat on the ass.
- Want ViktVäktarn or original?
- Two Weight security guard.
Richie said you used to be
cook in prison. Met you there?
- I worked with catering.
- Until you were with the prisoners.
Run your school bus out there?
If you could get the bird you
wanted. Which would you choose?
What are you doing here?
- Need only a place to sleep.
- How long?
A couple of days. Have some
business to take care of.
Want to bacon?
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. I was busy, but...
...I could help but look
at the ceiling for a while.
It was a false alarm.
I am so nervous.
Go to bed, I take a beer and
wait until you have fallen asleep.
- Now you're not afraid...
- You should not have keys to the house.
- I thought you called me.
- I did. But if you can go into...
- Which I never did.
- But you can. You have been here.
Not when you were here.
I got light on the porch.
I waited until you had gone,
so that we would not argue.
I am grateful that you have cooked
lamp and the first not in the bathroom.
This would be a
change. Nothing changed.
I move, Wayne.
I like not to blame
at you all the time.
No, there is no... my.
It is either good or it leaves you
country. We have no children, it's okay.
We can not have
children, it's okay.
Suddenly, we kill each other, we
differ and we are leaving the country.
It is all or nothing. What
happened to moderation? It is good.
I take it again!
I told you. He fucks the
bride from real estate agency.
I got him! You take the woman!
Ask me something
else. How are you?
He is out there,
he will soon return.
I may call you back.
You going out and hunt?
- I'm looking for your husband.
- He is not home.
I know. I wonder if I
may have come in and wait.
We have met before. Remember?
Will you shoot me?
- The police are here at any time.
- Have you had the time and call them?
I do not think you
are going to shoot me.
It is your big day. Empty Treasury
Add it to the disk. And chewing gum.
Get away!
Get up!
Are you indian?
You see indiansk out. You should
do something with your hair.
Get a little volume.
Look at me.
Are you sure you
are not indian?
Whatever.
How many times do you ask if
I saw him shoot the girl?
I thought she had
come out.
How many times will you
watch the hole in the tree?
My wife said she did not want to meet
him and you seem not to believe her.
No one has said, "good work.
" Or "it was brave of you. "
Maniacs are trying to kill us
and what do you do about it?
Paul Scallen, FBI.
It is the same color as the car, a
large Cadillac. Nobody seems to find it.
We found it. On Wapole Island.
However, there was not much color left.
- Do you have a Lionel Adam?
- Yes...
I have bad news.
Would you tell me what this is?
Why do they want to kill Lionel?
We're not sure, but we believe that
the looking for you. You have seen them.
The extruded just a
real estate agency.
Maybe this. But the
second has some history.
More known as the Blackbird.
Assassin for the Mafia.
- What did the Mafia to do with us?
- Boss was killed last week.
Together with a girl. That
was probably an inside job.
Thanks to you, we know that
he was in the area. If we can -
- pick him up, even if it is for
blackmail, would he like to make a deal.
Are we going to testify
against an assassin?
He will come
after you anyway.
- Without you, we can not take him.
- What do you suggest?
Your life is in danger, so you
qualify you for white patronage.
- Do you want to move us?
- Until we find them.
We will give you new identities,
temporary job. You do not sell the house.
We can make a deal with Nelson Davies.
It may be for sale at pretending.
- I am.
- Why are you calling me?
- I need a car. A lawful.
- Boss is very angry at you.
- He fucked the bride you killed.
- Can you get it or not?
You can not come here.
Everyone is looking for you.
We move your luggage tonight. New
cars are waiting for you tomorrow.
- People who have come out of protection.
- The destination is two hours south.
You live here
in your new name.
You must be Pam Wenkovsky.
I am your husband Matt.
It is better to remain as
close truth as possible.
- How long have you been married?
- 15 years.
On a construction site June
4, 1991, in St. Albans.
Who asked first? How long
after you got married?
- A week?
- How many children?
Nearly one.
If they moved, why is
their furniture left?
Are you going to
kill Donna, too?
- She is a witness.
- What are you?
You need me. Adding fingerprint
everywhere. Sno cars. Do the heavy lifting.
- Who is it?
- I'm looking for Wayne Colson.
- Who gave you my number?
- It was a new guy who works here.
We have tried to get hold of Wayne. He
gave us this number before he left.
- Did he make you, my number?
- He gave it to the head.
It is late in Heron. But he
said you knew where he was.
- Wayne, that is.
- They tell nothing to me.
I have a check that I
want to give him.
Good morning. Welcome.
If the neighbors ask, as paid
you about 200,000 for the house.
It looks more like 150,000.
There is not
much privacy here.
Do you want privacy,
please close the door.
- But I do not think you want it.
- You 're exactly what you want.
There is a chance
I can stop you.
There is a delay in the divorce,
while the couple is hiding the killers.
This is Elvis Presley Esplanadi
a regning day. This...
...is Lisa Marie. A jet he bought,
christened it after his daughter.
We birthday on the same day.
- One more thing. My life number is nine.
- What is a life number?
You add your birth date. February is
the second month, so it becomes two.
I was born the first. Two plus one is
three. Then add to the year you were born.
I will not say it.
There will be nine.
If you were born in
1900. Then it will be ten.
Ten counted as...
Get dressed and buy beer. Do you
think he cares about your pictures?
What is the difference in me
and Elvis? I live and he is dead.
I have news for you. Will
someone to visit you when you die?
Not even your mother,
if you had someone.
But if 100 years will
be still visit Graceland.
You are so fucking stupid.
Let me ask you something.
Elvis would sing
for you or fuck you?
I know what you think. You will
call me liar. But he had to sing.
I believe her.
Elvis had not come.
He had not been
sufficiently smelly or dirty.
Why are you not just
shut up for a while?
- If you talk again...
- Yes, what happens?
- This is Elvis billiardroom...
- Can we talk, Armand?
- What is your fucking problem?
- You are.
From now you do
not leave my sight.
Do you want to check when I go to
the toilet? Or when I fucked Donna...
Or pretend we like you
do not want to fuck her?
Listen to me. Shut your
mouth closed, so do not worry.
So you are a welder? Can you
weld together things waterproof?
I can weld together a house,
so it does not collapse.
Today, she may not say where they
are. But tomorrow... can she may.
What a job, you
and Wayne worked on?
We have been on different.
Anyway. I do not care about
who that sends the check.
- But the boss says we should do it.
- I told you I do not have the address.
I only have their phone
number. You want it?
- That said, you never. Have you?
- Not on the phone.
I did not know who I was talking to.
They will find out if you are at home.
So they can rape one.
I understand. One
must be careful.
Can you give him a check.
Then you know where the ports.
In the nearest bar.
I should not bend me so much.
It's like pressing a knife in me.
Lie down on the couch.
No, to sleep on
the carpet instead.
I will give you a back massage. I
had a foster mother who taught me.
- Do you know what you do?
- Yes.
Don't hurt me?
What did you do?
I gave her a back massage.
It is a Missouri number.
I robbed a bank there.
Hey, it's Matt and Pam. We are
not here. We are calling.
Hello?
Hi, I am. Tried to call
a few times...
No, I'm fine.
I lose you...
We must have a plan. Would you
like to wait until the track number?
It had all my numbers.
- Why do not want to go to Missouri?
- We will. When they stop looking for us.
And when they think we have
stopped looking for them.
This is the bedroom.
- I love how you say "bedroom. "
- We love our mansord.
- You will not here.
- It is true.
Where are you from?
Detroit side.
We never looked
in the kitchen.
Are you me?
- How was the tour?
- You should know. You were there.
You sold to Gerald? He
has looked in many places.
- Do they agree that we are here?
- Come by the office anytime you want.
- What happens if we behave?
- What are you talking about?
What happens if we are to use as bait.
The FBI is waiting for them to find us.
- What if they turn up here?
- They get caught.
- Before they kill us?
- Yes, I am voting on.
I can not pretend to do my job. I
waiting for someone to take a gun.
What are our choices?
Sit here and be mad?
I do not know.
You can tell me.
Can we try something else?
Come on down after work. Meet the guys
and their wives. They are good people.
We can take something
to eat at the beach.
- Is there anything bothering you?
- Yes, this bothers me.
You and me. Not gangsters.
- I need your help with something.
- Drug you out me here, to put it?
You are brave. I do not
care about what you need.
Yes, you. That is why
you came when I called.
You do not want the police taking me.
They ask where I was when the old man died.
How will they connect me to
someone they go up from this lake.
The blue Cadillac you gave me.
The paper tray in hand,
registered to your peperoniföretag.
If something happens to me, a friend
drive the car into a police station.
They will find the gun I killed man
with, for you. Wrapped in a letter.
From me.
No love letters.
This will you do for me.
There is a cemetery in Port
Heron, my brother is buried there.
He never got the the
funeral he was worth.
When you go up there,
has clouds around them.
Some days it is believed
that one sees things
clear. Your home.
The store you shop in.
The church you got
married in. I can see
everything. All the
places I have ever been on.
- Why did you moved here?
- The job ended.
When you reach a certain age,
move down one. One floor per year.
- I have my pride. A little too much.
- You should talk less and drink more.
These stacks deserves
a round, Linda.
How you fell for a kind
of shy guy like Matt?
His muscles and short pants.
He would shine even then.
All the guys were after
her. She is pretty and smart
- Do not overdo it, Matthew.
- Your mother always said, Carmen, honey...
For that was what her mother
called her. For she is good singer.
You are a gifted girl, do not
discard away your life with a welder.
Then you wake up on 20 years and
understand that he does not deserve you.
15 years.
- He lies, my mother adores him.
- There is kareoke on Friday.
- You must come.
- Just wait, she beats all.
I will hit you, Matt.
I checked in you, you should
talk less and drink more.
Why does it feel like I feel best,
when you talk to other people?
- I like this town.
- Tell all your stories.
Just saying the truth tonight.
No, not lit the lamp.
Are you married?
No, I have a break.
- Do you live here?
- I can not tell where I live.
It is a secret.
We found them last week.
Two corpses. Shot
and driven to a
appropriate place and
fired up the car.
Not much to identify.
Indians have a brother. Sitting
for life in Kingston Prison.
We did tests. Check
with his.
It matched.
- What now?
- When we are ready, you can go back.
- We may not want it to go back.
- It happens.
- But if we want, we can?
- Also occurs.
- Still busy.
- Try again.
I'm not your little
brother, you decide not me.
- I know. I buried my brother.
- Take it easy. We are dead.
They dig a little to, we live. We bought us
just a little more time. Please try again.
She unpacks, I will find her.
She will call you
when she comes home.
No, I will stay
here for a while.
A court decision.
I am not sure that
we do that either.
Okay, Mom. It is estimated.
She says that we
will not shatter.
God knows that I asked for it.
- Homework. Many laughs.
- I await the movie.
Can we at least try?
Now that we are safe?
Matt and Pam may be able to resolve
those things Wayne and Carmen could not.
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.
- Stop.
- No.
Mess with me. Do not say no.
It is not a thing.
It is not a day.
It is not a child
or no children.
It is the year.
I need time.
Time to remember what I think
about you and what you think of me.
Okay, we solve it.
I think we can solve it.
I think we started
to fix this.
Who is it?
Are you gonna go?
Richie also?
What did he say about me?
You know how he is.
He brags about you.
- As I work with?
- It is not me to do.
I have appreciated your company.
I think you're a nice person.
And I wish you every success.
I forgot something.
Please respond.
Are you hungry?
Your mother told you to be home to
breakfast, you could have run faster.
We are getting hungry.
You have beautiful hair.
Move up a little bit.
To take something from here.
Want to get food for Bird?
We brought their own food.
- What do you want?
- We are waiting only for your husband.
Then what?
Can you not say so?
I know why you are here.
Last, you held a gun on me,
wanted you to kill me. Right?
But you could not.
- Where is it?
- In Missouri.
- So, your husband has it?
- I hope so.
Why do not we shoot her now and
take care of her husband later?
Please do not reply. Where does he
think she was to buy food. He comes home.
What is this?
- Test. You may attract a deer.
Make your lunch to Bird?
Has he liked dessert yet?
- I only eat chicken. Do you know why?
- No.
For Wade Boggs to the
chicken before each
match. Therefore he
called the "Chicken Man. "
Do you know who Wade Boggs is? Bird does
not know shit. I would be basbollspelare.
My terrible childhood as orphans, destroyed
everything. So I became a bank robber.
I have an idea. Take
off your clothes.
You do not take you all the clothes. Only
the trousers and linen. If you have it.
Do you?
She has none. You can walk around in panties
then. Be a little topless. Serve drinks.
You need to kick
harder than that.
You feel much better about you take
off your clothes and wash yourself
Use that.
Do you need somewhere
to sleep away bakfyllan?
Give me five minutes.
You would be topless.
- That is my husband's jacket. Take it.
- We can make a change.
I take the jacket...
...if you take the linen.
I like your outfit. You look
like a little school girl.
Are you going to respond now?
Let the call.
We are not here. Leave
a message...
Ends you ever eat?
Is there anything
wrong? Are you afraid?
There is no reason for it. When
Wayne come home, do we have a chat.
Is not it?
Are you concerned about someone
else want, before you run out of it?
What should you do when Donna
asks you use one of Elvis costume?
You can always have the pink he
had, before he was big as a pig.
I read about a guy.
He weighed 580 kg.
At breakfast he was to type one
kilograms bacon. A couple dozen eggs.
For lunch he had eaten four hamburgers,
four cheeseburgers, four boxes of chips.
For dinner three steaks, six
fried potatoes, regular potatoes.
A little filling. Can
you imagine him poop?
Donna, it's Bird's baby...
When this is over, the Bird and
Donna go to Memphis, hold hand...
Look at Elvis
stuff. Is not it?
The only problem is, that
Donna fucking Elvis as we speak.
You were warned,
just like any other.
Do you know why I shot him?
He was not the I thought.
I had a little brother.
We were in a hospital.
When we were done, there
was a nurse who was there.
She saw us.
My little brother just
stood there and watched.
He looked for a long time.
Maybe he liked her face.
In all cases,
there he died of.
Go and put on some clothes.
I have to go upstairs.
I am not as Richie.
I do not like.
I know.
You meet a woman. You
think she sees you.
See who you are
beneath the surface.
But it turns out that she
only is a slut with lipstick.
I see you. I panicked
when I saw the gun.
- Where is your husband? When he comes home?
- I do not know.
When you call him. Call the
and says he will come home.
I am tired of waiting. I
want to get it over with.
He will not return.
He is in Missouri.
He is not even my
husband anymore.
Do you not? Do you
anything about real life?
Real life? What
the hell is that?
Missouri?
Carmen!
It is I!
Honey?
You must let me.
I have no key.
Listen to me.
I have had 600 km and
15 years of reflection.
Five is bad, that
was what you said.
So, we invest in six.
And then, when we
have something six...
...we aim to seven.
I really want to reach ten.
For I get it now.
Carmen?
I understand.
If you are not going to let me
in, let me download anything.
In the car. A gift...
You must know what you
do, when you enter.
You must have been
thinking about it.
not staying. Do not
be interesting.
It is empty.
Where do you no
mistakes.
