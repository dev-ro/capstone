Anna.
I suppose you expect
me to care for your
child once again?
Mother, Catherine's
old enough
to look after herself.
Get herself to bed
and brush her teeth.
I should know.
I was left alone far
longer and far younger.
How dare you?
Just because you've
decided to stay here
and shrivel up and die
doesn't mean I have to.
You're just jealous of me.
You ungrateful child!
I sacrificed
everything for you!
Now you've abandoned
your bastard child with me,
while you constantly disappear.
You are a
horrible mother!
I learned from
the absolute best.
Your father would
die if he could see what
you've done to yourself!
You look like a
painted harlot!
I'm glad my father never
had to see what an evil,
vile woman you've become!
She doesn't love you.
Oh that's enough
play, child!
It's time you
went to bed.
No, now there's no point
in being sentimental.
It will get you
no-where in this world.
To bed.

Catherine, who were
you talking to?
My friend, Marie.
Catherine, what
are you doing?
It's for Marie.
There's no-one there.
You're crazy!
OK, time for bed.
She's crazy.
She's crazy!
Harry!
Goodnight.
Abby?
Yes?
Can you go get Marie?
Ah it's sleeping time now,
we can look for her
in the morning.
But she's afraid
to be alone.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Goodnight
Catherine.
What's wrong, are you
alright Catherine?
There's something
scary over there.
There's no-one here.
Go back to sleep.
Catherine...

he must die.
Have your bath.
I'll check on
you in a bit.

Ah Catherine, thanks
for being so patient.
Here you are.
I want you to take
three of these.
One after every meal.
They'll help you
feel more relaxed.
Thank you Doctor.
Here we've discussed
this in length.
Time will be the true

Losing a baby...

Be patient.
Allow yourself

Now, enjoy your holiday

Getting out into

A change of scenery

What picture's this?
There's a little girl

Was it our daughter or

This is what
I'm telling you.

This is what I feel.
Our marriage

Apart from these

Well erm, I could have my

That's fine.
I'm about to put
the kettle on.
Do you wanna grab
a cuppa with us?
Ah you know
I'd love to. No.
I've got some
more work to do.
There's not much

Maybe I could go
into town if you like?
No don't trouble yourself,
I'm going to be picking up
our friends at the ferry
tomorrow in the village so
we can grab something
on the way back.
I see, I see.
OK... erm

She's fine.
I'm hoping coming
back to the area's
gonna do her good.
You know we were
all so, so sorry
to hear about
your young
Lilly's passing.
It's just
such a shame.
Thanks for your

It's been very difficult,
especially for Catherine.
Yeah Catherine,
that's a poor girl.
Ah she's had no
luck in this life.
Yeah the folks
around here

Well apparently

You know how I feel
so please feel free.
You know what Doctor,

think she blames me
for the whole thing.
Is that what it is really?
Can't you just admit it?
And that's, that's

What happened?
I fell asleep...
in the bath.
I had this horrible
nightmare about
visiting Lilly's grave.
Shh.
It's OK it was just
a dream that's all. OK?
I dreamed that I was
sinking into her grave
and then I woke up
and there was mud
inside the bath.
Darling that's just
residue from the pipes
in this old house.
The same thing happened to
me earlier when I was down
in the kitchen.
It was mud.
There was mud inside
the bath and there
was lots of it.
Well look it's

Look let's get you

Yes Hi, this
is Harvey Caldwell.
I was wondering
if Dr Chandler is
available please?
Yeah I can hold.
Ah. Dr Chandler,
yeah it's Harvey.
Er not, not good.
Catherine's getting far
worse on this medication.
I don't know what to do.
She's having those
nightmares again.
Yes well, as I
mentioned in the
last therapy session
the medication will take
a while for her to adjust to.
The important thing
is that she get her
much needed rest.
How is she adjusting
to the countryside?
Well I thought you
know the change of
scenery would do
her good but...
but it doesn't seem to be
working does it?
Yeah well, I do think
it's the best thing
for her right now.
Give it some time.
The medication should
level off in a few days.
I'll tell you what, give
me a call in a few days.
Let me know how
she's feeling and
how you're
getting on
and in the meantime
keep an eye on her.
Make sure that
she's eating and
taking her
medication on a
regular basis.

remember, these
things take time.
OK I will, I
will definitely.
OK. Bye.

Damn, is that the time?
I've gotta go

Could you go down
and get some wine for

Hmm?
Well.
Sigh.
The whole time, since
we've lost our daughter,
nothing but me, me, me.
Are you the only
one that's lost
a daughter here?
Do you not think about
anybody but yourself?

Isn't it?

Why so typical?

Open it!
Fifteen minutes ago there

I'm not staying in

Look.
I promise you we'll get
through this together.
You know how
much I love you.
If you loved me
you'd believe me.
Catherine,
that's not fair.
Lilly meant the
world to me.
I've lost my
daughter too.
And now I'm
losing my wife.
You know I got him
a surprise but it's
up in the room.
Wow!
Did you kill it yourself?
Yeah, I also cooked
it myself too.
No thanks to you two.
Well done!
Oh hey hun, I
was actually about to
wake you for dinner.
Well didn't want
to miss the party.
That's the spirit!
Where's my wine I
went through hell
to get earlier?
I didn't tell you
guys what happened.
So I went into the
cellar to get some wine
and one of the windows
must have been open or
something
and the gate slammed shut
and the key came out.
It's probably the first
time that key has come
out in a hundred years.
Oh you know, there was a
pipe down there that was
leaking that you should
probably have a look at.
Yeah, me and Simon
can take care of that
tomorrow, right?
Right you are.
But isn't that a
job for a mechanic?
You mean a
plumber darling.
Whatever.
Plumber.
So, how's the
gallery going?
It's going really well.
Trying to keep the
misses in the lifestyle
she's accustomed to.
Give me your plate.
Oh no I'm good, I'm...
You don't like chicken?
It's not chicken, it's
pheasant darling.
Erm no, I'm a vegetarian.
Hmm, that's why
you're so skimpy.
Skinny darling.
Well, skinny.
Look at her.
She's too skinny.
Sasha, why don't you
go next door and get
us a bottle of wine?
No, no, no, I'll get it.
No, no, no, you sit down.
Eat your chicken.
I'll be back.
She really does
mean well you know.
Yeah, I'm sure she does.
So Simon, what's
this great news your so
excited about telling us?
Ah it's nothing.
I'll tell you
about it later on.
So what are you
guys talking about?
Nothing darling.
No, no come on now.
You guys told us you
had some great news
to share with us.
It's really nothing.
Let's talk about it later on.
No, let's tell them.
So me and Simon,
we're having a baby.
Ah mate, that's fantastic.
Well done.
Thank you.
-Thanks.
You're kidding right?
Sweetheart, we should be
really happy for them.
I mean, look at her!
She's just had a bottle
of wine, she's got a
glass in her hand
and she's telling
us she's pregnant?
In my country we have
an "inconstitution"
like cows.
Oh please...
Really?
We drink and smoke
and baby is fine.
Right darling?
You know what?
She got the cow bit
right didn't she?
Come on Catherine!
Come on!
Guy's, I'm really sorry.
She'll be fine.
So, can I interest you in
losing a game of snooker?
Yeah, OK.
Ah, you guys have fun
and I'm gonna go for
a swim again huh.
Listen.
I'm sorry.
I feel like I haven't
really been there for
you since Lilly died.
I can't imagine how
difficult it must
have been.
I feel like I'm doing
everything I can to help
her with this
but...
I feel like I'm losing her.
Like I was saying,
I can't believe you've
finally gone and done it.
I can't believe it either.
Being a father,
it'll be good
for you.
To be honest,
I'm scared to
death.
Who of, the baby
or of Sasha?
Well she is a bit of
a handful isn't she?
Mate, she's more
than a handful.

died in there.
She's gone to bed.
Calm down sweetheart.
I'm sure it's
just an accident.
It was not an accident!
It was not a joke!
She almost killed me!
Why would she do something
like that to you?
Because she hates me
because I'm having a baby.
Hold on Sasha.
You hold on a minute,
I'm going to find her.
Wait, she's sleeping!

What is wrong with you?
You could have killed me.
What?
What are you
talking about?
She did it.
She must have.
Sasha said that someone
locked her in the sauna
a few moments ago.
I've been in bed
since dinner.
Yeah right!
It was just an accident.
I would never do
something like that!

Whatever.
