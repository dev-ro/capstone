Hey!
Perv!
Weirdo!
Baby girl!
Soooo What do you think?
I miss the Red.
Boo. You're no fun.
I know.
Well, how was camp?
Any good digs?
Yeah. Some.
And the other kids?
Fine.
And the boooooys?
Oh. That nice, huh?
Don't.

Boys boys boys boys ♪
♪ Girls girls... ♪
What! I missed you!
Can't I miss you?
Yeah, I missed you, too.
Great! So then next year
you stay home!
- Maybe.
- Oh, come on, baby girl,
don't you think you're getting
a little old for that camp?
- If it's cause of Tommy...
- It's not.
Well, if it is...
- It's not!
- I'm just saying,
it wouldn't kill you
to maybe dress a bit sexier
- every now and then.
- Okay, look, Mom!
Tommy is cute,
but he's not why I go there.
You know that.
So, please stop.
- Fine.
- Please.
Fine. Fine.
Can you scratch my arm?
Hm-mm.
You wanna drive?
You? Really?
Sure!
Don't I need like a permit?
Do you want to drive or not?
Oh, look at you! All excited!
Yaaaay!
Yes! Seatbelt.
Check, okay.
Hands at ten-two,
foot on the brake
and put the car into drive.
But che-check
your blind spot first.
And-and the mirror.
Oh, God!
You'll have to adjust those.
And the seat...
God, is it getting hot in here?
Wait!
But, don't forget to signal!
Mom!
Too much?
Okay.
Oh! Look at you.
Ah!
You're doing great.
Okay, steady.
You show, hey... Libby, Libby,
Libby, road!
- Mom!
- What?
It's just for
one of the vacant lots.
We talked about this!
Oh.
We're gonna need money
for college, baby girl.
The romance stories aren't
selling like they used to.
I know.
Betty said she's still
willing to show us
around at SUNY Adirondack.
SUNY.
What? It's affordable.
Yeah, affordable, huh?
What? Don't you dare!
It was a gift!
- Gi... gift?
- Yeah.
From who?
Mm-mm.
You'll see
- Um, whose...?
- Great job, baby girl!!!
Come on.
We're here!
Babe?
Babe?
Mom?
Hello?
- What are you...?
- Hey!
Holy crap.
I know.
I'm writing him constantly.
Eww.
Hm-mm.
Who wears a speedo?
Libs, this is
my boyfriend, John.
Miss Wells,
it's a pleasure
to finally meet you!
Libby?
Hey.
I hope you don't mind
that I'm here!
I know it's your Lake house
and I'm not trying to
take away time with your Mom.
So...
Oh! I've actually
got something for you.
Can you give me just a minute?
You have a boyfriend?
I know!
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought it was just a fling!
I mean, look at him.
Is he what you were "doing"
every time I called?
Okay.
This is for you.
Your mom told me
that you're really
into archeology.
This is the Navajo tribes'
"stone of life".
It's the only "object"
they really assign any value to
outside of its utility.
And, if you look here,
the upside-down
crescent moon shape?
It's called a 'Naja'
by the Navajo,
but it's actually
Moorish in origin!
It represents the Phoenician
goddess of fertility.
Basically,
this bracelet has origins
from the Western
and Eastern world
all the way back to the very
beginning of civilization.
So...
Thanks.
You're very welcome.
Oh, if you want
the gift receipt,
it's in the box.
Well, who's hungry?
Hey
Yeah. Don't be a weirdo.
Please.
Honey, dessert. What am I
gonna have for dessert?
Hey!
Hi.
Hope you're hungry, baby girl!
You look nice.
You cooked?
Of course, I cooked!
Eh-eh-eh I'll get that.
Oh, yeah?
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Mm-mm.
Oh, that tastes really good.
Mm-mm.
So, Libby?
How was camp?
Uh. It was okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I think it's getting like,
uh, a little routine.
How did you guys meet?
I will let you
take that one.
Well, uh, I-I came out
early this year
because some work needed
to be done to the back deck.
I swear!
Anyways, I was outside
writing on the porch one day
when John just
kind of appeared!
I... I've been
at the Lake all year.
I, uh, I'm studying
a few species here.
He's an aquatic geneticist!
- Wait, really?
- Hm-mm. Yeah.
I'm part of
a small research team.
We're sort of scattered
around the region here.
What are you researching?
Mostly freshwater animals.
We're trying to solve
a problem in nature.
Hm-mm. Libs!.
What problem?
Well
Can I borrow this, please?
Of course.
So the earth has
a finite amount of freshwater.
In fact, only 2.5%
of the Earth's water is fresh,
leaving 97.5%
as salt water.
And within those freshwater
ponds and streams,
and glaciers,
many, many species live.
Unfortunately,
due to continual increase
in the Earth's temperature,
there isn't enough rain to
supply these freshwater systems.
And there's more evaporation
in the oceans leaving a planet
with an overall
increasing level
of salinity.
And now,
some of the species,
well, they can't survive
in such a rapidly changing world
without some major adaptation.
So, I am here
to speed up Mother Nature.
And
hopefully
in the end
make it
so that certain species
can survive
in a saltwater world.
Hm-mm. So, basically,
he's saving the world.
Oh, come on.
I'm definitely not.
Hon?
Oh, man.
Sorry.
Ah, I coughed up
a lung there.
You know that phrase.
- It's actually, well...
- Honey, honey.
Mm.
Ah!
Aaaah!
Oh, I like things
that are kind of wet.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hm-mm.
You're evil.
. What?
No, I didn't.
Mm.
Scratch my arm.
Hm... mm.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
Morning, sunshine!
Morning.
How'd you sleep?
Well, thanks.
You want some breakfast?
I was thinking we could
go for a hike later?
Mom?
What?
It's the 28th.
Okay
August 28th!
Oh.
We can go after breakfast.
Can John come?
Ahhh I-I don't know.
Okay, fine. Just us two.
I'll explain later. Hm.
It's fine.
I'm gonna
make you some breakfast.
You'll love it.
So, what do you think
of John?
Mom.
Ugh.
It's important to me
that you like him.
I don't have
anything this year.
Fine.
What about Grandpa?
Mom!
It's been nine years, Libs!
So?
Alright. I'm gonna
go back to the house.
Fine. You never gave a shit,
anyways so...
Hey!
Hey, what?
You never have
anything nice for him.
And one year, you gave him
a roll of toilet paper!
That was funny!
He was gassy!
Just go play
with your boyfriend.
Hm. I think I will.
No wonder
he gave me the house.
Excuse me?
He gave you the house
because he loved you!
He loved you, Libby,
more than he ever loved me.
Yeah.
That's kind of my point.
No. No, Libby.
You don't get it.
He never loved me.
You wanna know why I don't
give him a note every year?
You want to know why?
Because after he died,
and I was cleaning out
this shithole house,
I found his divorce
agreement to Grandma.
He wrote to the lawyers
saying,
"She can have Michelle,
I'll take Marc."
That.
That was the last note.
That was the only note.
Ow!
Ow!
No. Stop! Stop! Stop!
That's a Scolopendra!
They're really rare!
Careful.
Let's get back in there.
Alright, come on.
It bit me!
Well, I would guess, ah
It was protecting its offspring.
There we...
Sorry, I didn't know
it was doing that.
That's all right.
Where did she get you?
Right here.
Let me see.
Whoa!
I don't want to scare you,
but their bite is venomous.
Looks like
you're gonna be okay.
Just put some ice on it
so it doesn't swell, okay?
Okay.
What were you doing out here?
Um, I like to come out here
after it rains.
See if anything gets unearthed.
You?
Came to check on you, actually.
Oh.
Everything okay?
Yeah. Fine.
Hm-mm.
I know it's not really
my business, but, uh
your Mom came back
pretty upset.
Oh.
I hope it's nothing
with me being here.
Maybe I should take off.
Our team's almost done
around here.
I can finish up at home.
I don't want to cause
a rift between you two.
I know how much
she loves you.
You know,
the way she described you,
the way she talked
about you
it's what made me
fall in love with her.
You love her?
Very, very much.
Well, I'll be in the basement
packing up my stuff.
Oh, I have some of my things
down there for the low light.
Sorry, I should
I should have told you.
It's okay.
You know, you should stay.
I'll go talk to her.
Ah, I would maybe
give her a little bit.
Last I checked,
she wasn't feeling real great.
Mom?
Ma?
Hm-mm.
I'm not drinking.
I've been good this summer.
I swear.
Hm.
Ah.
What's wrong?
Ah. My stomach.
Must've been my cooking.
I'm sorry, about before.
I didn't know, so
It's okay, baby girl.
I'm sorry I told you.
I know Pop-pop
meant a lot to you.
This doesn't change that.
Did you find anything cool?
- Sort of.
- Hm.
You should show John!
I think you two
have a lot in common.
Libs, there's something
I got to tell you
and I don't want you
to freak out.
Okay.
Okay
Ah, well
John asked me to marry him,
and I said "yes."
Well, "hell, yes"
to be exact.
What?
I love him, Libby.
I love him so much.
So, so much.
He's amazing.
And I know you'll love him too.
I promise you will.
It's important to me
that you're okay with this.
I need you to be okay,
baby girl.
Please don't call me that.
Okay.
I'm happy for you guys.
I love you, Mom.
I want you to be happy.
Oh, I love you, baby...
I love you, Libs!
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.
Just one more thing.
Wh-what?
John doesn't really know
that I'm 42.
What do you mean?
He thinks I'm 35?
Mom! That so...
I know,
I know, I know!
I'm-I'm gonna tell him.
I-I've been meaning to, just
I-I can't lose him, Libs.
I just, I can't.
Hey, you won't.
You're incredible, so
Hey
I gotta... I should
I should clean up. Yeah.
Yeah.
Hello?
Ah. It's me.
Oh, hey!
But, turn that light off, yeah,
I'll-I'll come and get you.
Hey, what an awesome surprise!
I tried knocking.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, it's okay.
I'll be, uh, the humidifiers,
they get really loud,
so sometimes I don't hear.
How's your Mom?
She's fine. Yeah.
Good.
Um, I brought you
something to drink, so
Thank you.
Ah, I can't, uh,
I can't do the sodium.
Bad ticker.
But thank you.
Hm-mm.
Yeah.
So, uh
you want to check out
my craziness?
Right this way.
Come here.
Uhh.
Uhh.
What are those?
Lampreys.
Really?
Yeah. You're familiar?
Yeah. Slightly.
I figured you might be.
These little guys
are 360 million years old.
Right up your alley!
Ah, yeah. They're, um
mentioned a lot
in the fossil record.
Hm-mm.
Yeah, these little guys
have survived it all.
Meteors
ice ages
ever increasing and decreasing
salinity levels.
In fact, they are
the only aquatic species
to be found in the fresh
and saltwater records.
Huh.
They're parasitic.
See the mouths? The teeth?
They latch onto their prey.
And they can adapt
to their host.
So, even if they encounter
anadromous species
like Smelt,
or Salmon, or Bass,
spawning
in a freshwater pool,
or stream, or river,
they can attach
and then adapt.
So even if they
end up in the sea
they'll survive.
No other species on Earth
that can do that.
Not one.
It's beautiful.
Beautiful?
Hm-mm.
Yeah.
You're kind of a-a weird dude.
Yeah, I guess I am.
But, I mean,
weird is cool, right?
Yeah.
Um
So, I heard that you and
my mom are getting married?
Yeah, yeah. Ah
She told you, huh?
Yep.
Yeah, we are.
Libby, she's very,
very special to me.
Good.
We have to celebrate!
You can have a party!
You can invite
some of your girlfriends.
Ah, I don't...
Maybe.
Should I go check on your mom?
Or-or...
Nah, no, no.
She's um, she's fine.
Just let her sleep.
Okay.
In that case
you want to help me pull
some samples from the lake?
Oh, okay.
How old are you?
How old do I look?
Twenty-five.
Ho-oh, thank you.
Twenty-six?
Thirty.
Oh.
Where did you go to school?
Uh, a little, private school
that no one has ever heard of.
It probably explains
why I'm so well-funded.
Can you hold my legs
for a second?
Yep.
Right there.
Come on.
Yeah.
Well, I'm applying
Early Decision
to Cambridge next year.
Really?
Yeah, I got, uh,
a perfect score on my PSATs
and, um, my counselor says
I'm probably gonna be
Valedictorian, so
Libby, that's amazing!
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's great.
Yeah.
It's-it's really far but, um,
the archeology programs there
are like the best in the world.
- Yeah.
- And like the history there
is just so awesome. So
Very awesome.
Hm-mm, thanks.
Does your mom know?
Kind of holding off on that.
She's so attached.
Right.
- Yeah.
- Well
Thank you.
Yeah, she wants me
to stay here,
but the state programs
are so awful.
Ahh!
I'm sorry.
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry!
I didn't want you
to ruin your dress.
And I-I just reacted.
I didn't really know
what to do.
Hey, hey, Libby, Libby.
Listen
it's okay!
We're both scientists.
Right?
Hm-mm.
This is totally normal.
Look, it's
it's no big deal.
You have a little red
in your hair.
Just chuck the shirt
in the trash.
Hey, Libby?
Are you okay?
Libby?
- Hey, Libby?
- I'm in the shower.
Thank you.
Okay. Sorry.
Just checking.
Mom?
Mm-mm.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, John just, uh...
Mom?
John?
Libby?
What are you doing out here?
What are you doing out here?
I don't know.
I just woke up out here.
Ah, I saw you!
I saw you walk into the lake!
- What?
- Right here.
I saw you walk into the Lake.
Towards this like light!
I'm-I'm pretty dry.
What?
Libby, I should have
mentioned this earlier,
and I'm really sorry.
I suffer from somnambulism.
It's sleepwalking.
I'm really sorry
if I scared you.
I feel like everything
that I have done
since you got here has been
an absolute catastrophe!
I have this way of
I just fuck everything up.
Except for my research.
It's the one time
that I-I like I work.
Does that make sense?
Look, please,
come back inside.
I got to keep
one of you healthy. I...
Do you always lock the doors
when you sleepwalk?
Libby?
Libbbyyyy!
Libby!!!
Mom?
Libby, in here!
Mom?
What's wrong?
Libby
I need you to take the car,
and go into town,
and get me medicine.
Okay?
Something called
cyclizine and Ginger Root.
And whatever else.
- Everything!
- Mom, I can't drive!
If somebody pulls you over,
tell 'em it's an emergency.
Well then, we-we need to
call an ambulance!
Oh, God.
It's not really an emergency.
- What?
- I
Mom?
I need you to also get me
a pregnancy test.
- Mom!
- Libby! Go! Please!
Why can't John do it?
Because John's on
one of his marathon jogs.
He won't be back for hours.
Please, just go, Libby.
I need something.
Marley's coming in an hour.
I can just wait for her
and then
Uh, Marley's come...
Ahhh!
Libs, please go.
- Okay.
- I'll look out for Marley.
Excuse me, Miss?
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.
Excuse me, Miss.
You forgot to pay for that,
young lady.
Sorry.
Hey!
Hey!
- Did you see?
- Yep. Wow.
Yeah, okay.
Excuse me.
Okay. I got you everything
you asked for.
It's Ginger root,
cyclizine, and, um, the
and the, um
Oh. It's okay, Libby.
We talked.
I know.
Thanks, baby.
Thanks, Libs.
Do you need help
getting to the bathroom?
No, no.
Not right now.
John?
I'll be alright.
Go hang out with Marley.
Maybe I should stay.
No, I'm fine.
John will take care of me.
I think that I should stay.
Lib! Please!
Marley's downstairs.
I'm tired.
It's okay.
I'll take care of her.
Promise.
Go hang out
with your friend.
She looks fun.
What?
I got this!
Don't worry!
Use the card
if you want to order something.
Okay.
Hm-mm.
If you need me,
just yell.
Will do!
Don't say it.
- Don't!
- He's so hot. Oh, my God!
- Eeeek!
- Sshh.
Is your mom okay?
I don't know.
She thinks
that she is pregnant.
Wait, what?
- Momma-Dukes is preggo?
- Hm-mm.
Oh, smells!
Okay, so you're going to have
like a little brother or sister.
Well, hopefully,
not a little sister though.
That'll be annoying.
Oh, a little boy though.
He's gonna have like his thing
- all over the place...
- Marley!
Although he'll probably
be pretty cute.
Filter. Right now.
Yeah. Okay.
Sorry. I'm done.
So, tell me,
why is John such a freak?
Okay.
So, last night,
I saw him walk into the lake.
Like completely
towards this like,
orange light at the bottom.
Really?
And I saw him
drink his own sweat...
Ewwww!
And he grabbed me.
What?
Like Donald Trump,
he grabbed me.
Jesus.
Did you tell your mom?
No! She's head-over-heels
in love with him.
Like psycho-girlfriend
in love with him.
Like
Jaime-Savard in love with him.
Oh, God.
Okay. Still,
you need to talk to her.
Or call the cops!
I know.
Um hey, can you
stay here tonight? Please.
Okay, I'm going to sound
like the worst friend ever,
but I can't.
My Dad has this
'Behind the Book' charity event,
and he has me working
live stream
'cause he just can't get
anything, right?
But you should come.
You need to get
out of this house.
No, I can't leave her alone.
Okay, okay.
Well, what if I go up there
and tell Michelle?
I don't know.
He didn't really grab me,
but I was-I was bleeding.
- Does that make me...
- Okay, no, Libs.
Fuck that. I'm gonna
go tell her.
Wait, he grabbed you
while you were bleeding?
What the fuck!
Michelle?
Hm-mm.
Mm.
Can you scratch my arm?
Hm-mm.
Where's Marley?
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
Marley left a while ago.
And why didn't you wake me?
- Well, we tried.
- Hm-mm.
You were passed out.
Are you feeling okay?
I'm fine.
You?
Go ahead.
Mom?
We're pregnant.
Oh.
Oh?
Congrats?
Libby, I-I need you
to be okay with this.
I'm really scared.
You're scared?
Yeah.
Did Marley talk to you?
Yes!
Why would you tell her that?
What?
He apologized.
He just reacted.
- It was a mistake!
- Mom. No, Mommy! He licked it.
- What?
- He
He licked it.
Oh, God.
I swear, every time, Liberty!
What do you mean, every...?
What... Every time?
Every time I date someone,
you come up with some BS.
It was cute
when you were a kid.
But, not anymore!
I'm done putting my life
on hold for your feelings.
John isn't going anywhere!
- Really?
- In fact, I think
you should apologize.
- No, no, no, no, no...
- No, she should apologize!
Babe, it's fine.
Really.
- Okay?
- Hm-mm. Hm-mm.
If we're going to be a family,
we have to learn
how to forgive and forget.
Right, Libs?
You're a freak.
- Mom! Get off of him.
- What?
- Hey, okay.
- Get off of him, now!
Get off of him, now!
- Get out of our house. Get out!
- Libby! Stop it, Libs!
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.
She's not 35, by the way.
- Libby!
- She's 42.
So, sure hope you weren't
planning on having another one.
I-I meant to tell you.
I'm I'm so sorry.
John?
Babe? Please say something.
Babe?
Babe? Please, don't be mad.
Babe? Please. John!
Let. Go.
Mom?
How dare you!
He's not normal!
Neither are we.
No.
That's not what
I'm talking about.
Then what are you
talking about, Libs?
What is it?
Does his sleepwalking
bother you?
His social anxiety?
What?
He's not perfect.
He-he loves me, after all.
He loves me.
By the way
John told me about Cambridge.
You wanna go?
Then, we're selling this house.
Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!
John! Oh, God!
Mom?
Mom?
Ugh!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Mom?
Mom!
Mom?
Mom?
- Wake up.
- Hm.
Mommy.
- That's it. Come on.
- Hm.
It's me.
- Oh, God!
- Shh, shh.
- Libby...
- It's okay. It's okay.
Libby, get out.
- Get out, Libby.
- Mom, it's okay. It's okay.
- Ahhhh!
- Shh.
Ahhhh!
Mom.
Libby!
You!
You!
Yes, me.
You monst... ahhhhh.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Don't be shy, love.
Come on.
Yes. Yes.
No! No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no.
Oh, it's okay. Okay.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Jesus.
- Mom! Come on.
- Just get out.
I'm not
leaving without you. Mom!
Aah!
Come on.
Aah!
Aaahh!
Liberty?
Libs?
Liberty!
I don't have time for this.
You know,
despite what you think,
I really do care
about your mom.
Everything that you see
in there is meant to help her.
To keep her healthy.
It's it's just science.
Libs?
Liberty?
Come here
NOW!
Leave us alone!
I called the cops!
Oh, no! You're lying!
You're lying!
Hey.
Hey.
Don't touch that. Stop!
911. What's your emergency?
Um, my stepdad's trying
to kill me and my Mom.
Please help us!
Okay, honey, calm down.
What's your name?
Liberty Wells.
Okay, Liberty,
where are you calling from?
Um, 5728 North Benson Road.
5728 North Benson Road.
Is that off of Route 5,
Black Rock Turnpike?
Yes!
Okay,
where in the house are you?
I'm in the basement.
Just please hurry.
Okay.
Where is your stepdad?
He's outside.
He's like trying to get in.
Does he have
any weapons on him?
No, but he's like
He's dangerous, so just
please hurry.
Okay. Officers are on route.
I need you to stay calm.
He's here.
We're on our way, Liberty.
Just hold on.
Liberty, are you
