My cousin gave me some weed ..
That's kewl
First time i ever smoked weed

And i knew that many other kids were doing it

I was always raised like real straight catholic ..
I was taught that the worst thing you could do in life
is  to make your mother cry ...
She always told me that if she'd caught me with some dope , it would like , kill her
But Bobby was always bugging me about it ..you know
..that it's so fucking important ..
So if he did it ..
I had to do it ..
So one day
We were at the bus stop waiting for the bus ..
And i smoked some of Bobby's ..
And he told me that shit was like ... weak
that i'll like barely even feel it ..
He must of fucking tossed that shit or smth ..
cause the whole fucking world like warped around me
I had no idea how to handle it ..
The only thing i can think to do
is like .. run.
I take off , and Bobby is running behind me,
laughing like crazy.
And i get home .. and in my bed
Bearing myself under a pillow,i was so fucking scared,man ..
And then...
Bobby yanks the cover or smth ..
You know what i did?

No. Son, you are smart. You have ambition

Your friend, Marty, is
living a life of complete aimlessness.
I dont know what happened to that kid ..
He used to be a good kid ..
He's got no ambition. I dont

To be your own master ..
If I do this for you...

Why'd you stop ..?
I dont know ..
You be good lil' man ... Alright ?..
- Alright ..
What do you wanna do .. ?
I wanna ask you something , Marty ..
Why do you let Bobby treat you the way he does ?
What?
Why do you let Bobby treat you the way he does ?
Hit you and stuff.. and make fuun of you.
He dissents you  right to your face in front of everyone
Derek thinks you guys are queer for each other.
- Derek's an asshole.
You know what?
I love you.
- Shut up.
I do. I love you and i care about you
and i dont wanna see you suffer.
I dont wanna see Bobby picking on you ever again
Bobby...
- What?
It's been like this since we
were little fuckin kids ,Lisa.
He's always been like this
He'd always beet the fuck out of me,
whenever he wants ,
And thats not a goddamn thing i can do about it
I begged my parents to move ..
You can move away yourself
I'm not even a fucking highschool graduate.
Yeah , i know ..tell me about ..
So thats nothing we can do to stop him .. ever ..
Kill'im ..thats about it ..
That's what i was thinking
What?
What are you talking about ?
Bob.
- What about Bobby?
What if he was gone ..
What kind of weird shit are you talking about ?
What if we kill him ?
Are u fuckin nuts ?
He treats everyone like shit.
He's always mean.He's always cruel.
Beat's you up.
He's even to weird for Ali ..
And she's into everything ..
He's the source for everybody's troubles , Marty
And even still he's gonna finish highschool..
and go to college .., and probably get rich
Yeah , and i'm gonna be delivering pizzas
How will we get a gun ?
My mom has one
Shit.. that motherfucker...
He's fuckin dissed me ..
Treated me like shit my whole goddamn life.
Lets kill him ..
Oh shit ..
You are one crazy bitch.
No i'm not.
Marty agrees with me.
This is the way for everyone to take care of their fucking problems
because Bobby is everyones fucking problem
What do you want me to do?
- Come down and help us.
Oh man ..
What are u gonna do it with?
- I dont know.
A gun or a knife or smth .. i guess ..
What are you doing?
- I'm just talkin to my dog.
Are you high?
- Now no.
My mom's in there , and shes like making plans for my 18 birthday party ..
She's gonna have a cake.. a fuckin clown ..and all that shit
you know ..when you're a kid ..
I think she's happy here.
She likes it a lot better than New Jersey.
Whatever..look. I need to talk to you about smth.
I have to go help my friend Lisa to kill this asshole named Bobby ..
I like it when u pull ... pull my hair ..cool
Shut up ..you're not gonna kill this guy .
- Yeah.
Like kill him .. like him in real life ?
Like kill him and he's dead ?
Woohw Ali ,.. thats some heavy shit .
- You wanna go with me?
I've got some good dope
Well .. ok ..i'm with ya
Where the fuck are you .. bitch ?
Back at rehab.
I've kinda messed up Ali.
Tweak (Methamphetamine n.a).
Well ..listen, i have to go down help my friend Lisa
to kill this asshole named Bobby
But if you want i can come pick u up.
Okay.
What if we drive by he's house when he's in his yard or some shit ..
Shoot'im down ..
Cops will think it's a gang thing.
Shit Lisa,thats a fucking great idea.
Thanx for getting me out.
- I stick with my homie ...
Is that a joint?
We've got like a box full of LSD.
Any tweak (Methamphetamine)?
How was rehab?
Just about raped Ali last time she came.
He beats me ..he's raped me before
The worst part is the way he picks on Marty.
Treats him like a dog or a slave or smth.
Pissing me off so bad i cant stand it.
- So what are you gonna do Lisa?
I'm gonna kill him.
That's some heavy shit...
- Yeah ...it is
So how are you gonna do it?
Why are you guys like so serious ?.
We're gonna fix Bobby Kent's ass.
- Kewl.
Can we get some napkins?
And a straw?
How we're gonna do it?
I was thinking ..
we could drive by his house when he's in his yard
or some shit.And shoot'im down.
Cops'll think it's a gang thing.
No ..somebody might see us , Lis.
You know what we could do, we could go into the guy's house,
while he's sleeping..and stab the fuckin in the neck
He's got a doberman.
Best way's just to shoot'im.
How are we get a gun?
- My mom has one.
We cant just knock him over the head
and drag him off somewhere.
How come?
He's too strong.
- Wait a sec, havent you ever met him before?
No.
Me neither, whats this guy like?
He's an asshole.
Oh shit, what the fuck is that for?
To kill Bobby Kent... dont you remember?
Wont that get blood everywhere?
We're gonna have to plan where we're gonna do it.
Hi, kids.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.
These are my friends from Palm Bay,
this is Donny and this is Heather.
Hi Donny.Hi Heather.
You kids have supper?
Yes, Ma'm.
Okay ...
Are we really gonna do this?
Ali, can you get this guy to shut up?
Shut up, Donny.
- We have to figure out a way to get him alone.
He's gotta be by himself.
Yeah,that's so much easier to
kill someone when his by himself.
Ali, what if you'd offer to fuck him again ?.
- Isnt this the guy who raped you?
What do you mean Lis , like bait ?
- Yeah
It's not enough for him to go.
What if offer to let him
dug out my five point-o...
Excuse me ? - And then offer to fuck him again
- He can drive you out to the Barren's.
Wait a second.Ok. If Ali
is supposed to be banging Bobby,
then what the fuck is Donny doing here?
I mean seriously like the guy is just
gonna go and kick it while smbd else screws his chick?
Nobody's that big of a dweeb.
He's right
We can say that i'm
Heather's boyfriend.
You know?
Thats good , right ...
Hey..what you doin?
- My homework.
No shit.
I'm over at Lisa's house
and that Ali chick is down here.
And i think she wants you.
What are you talking about, man?
Hold on.
Hey Bob, whats going on?
You're not pissed off?
- I kinda liked it actually,..i've been thinking about it.
Maybe we get together again
i think you could take my five point-o out.
- Marty, what's with this shit?
I dont know, i guess she digs you.
Got me jealous over here man . She's fine .
Hey, are you there with fuck-face ?
Yeah
Sick
Ok , so we do it and just roll the body into the canal.
The fuckin gators are gonna eat his ass for lunch.
Here.
What are you giving me that for?
- You're in the best position to do it.
You fuck him, and then right when he's gonna cum ,
you blow his brains out
Oh, shit.
- Man, thats kewl.
I dont want him dead ...
- Ali, you said you wanted him dead too.
It's too risky if i do it.
I'd have to folow, and he'd might hear me coming .
Here, take it.
I'll be close by, you shoot
And we'll ditch the body
All right, fuck it..let's go.
Hey Bobby, i'm Heather's girl..boyfrind...Fuck !
Hey Bobby, i'm Donny
this is Heather
I'm her boyfriend.
Thats good?
- Yeah.
I think we'd go out to west town, and mess around those new devels
and dug out my five point-o or some shit.
I'll give these two a ride back.
Wait a second. You're not comin?
- No, I'm fuckin worked.
What about her?
I'm coming with you ..
No,man ,i dont want your bitch
going along with us ...
Cmon Bobby, she's my homie.
havent seen her in a long time.. and..
we need to talk about some shit on the way out anyway ..
Hey, Bobby. I'm Donny.
This is Heather. I'm fucking her.
Whatever, I'm drivin.
Goodbye asshole..
You want to dug it out some more?
It is a five point-o.
But i'd dug you out.
What the fuck do we come out here for , then?
How about you give me a fuckin blow job .. now?
What this fucking bitch is talking about?
I'm going for a walk.
You've got a fuckin irritating laugh , bitch.
Miss Tennessee.
So is he dead?
- No, Lisa chickened out.
The fuck i did.
- Check out miss Texas,dude..
She's so fuckin hot ..
You couldnt do it.
- I was sad or smth.
At homicide they can take the bullet out of the body
and trace it back to the murder weapon.
If i use my mom's , they're gonna find out i did.
Then toss it ...
- Toss what?
The gun into the ocean,then they cant trace the bullet.
I cant do that ..that's my ma's gun ...
She'd kill me.
You are bullshitin , bitch.
- Are not.
Are so.
- you're all fuckin bullshitin.
You guys need proffesional help.
What the fuck is this shit? I thought you guys were profs ?
- We are fuckin profs.
You dont give us a shit we cant fucking use.

Hitman?
- No doubt.

Lay out the horn ...you're blastin my whole neighbourhood ..
What's up, Ali?
- Nothing.
We need to know if you can get those guns for us?
You need to give me a little time
I cant just snap the fingers and shit.
Guns are hard to come by.
- Yeah, I can get u some money.
Oh yeah?
And whose piggy-bank are you going to rob ?
Hey, cmon , you know u can trust us.
What are you guys gonna do with a gun ?
- It seems like the easy way to do it.
I think you need to chill out
and plan this out a little better
No i wanna do it now...I want the s.o.b dead.
i want he's sorry ass dead tonight..
Do you understand me?
You know , first , we have to get some
weapons and shit ,..i dont know , maybe you
think of planning this out a little better
Then , when you get all that done ,
then you can come see me
I have a window around the rear ,you
just come by and rap it a little , lightly ..
Like a signal , right ..?
like in Tom Sawyer ..
On a normal surprise-it
they dont wanna help out and shit..
Maybe i'll just come and supervise ..
I dont know.
But either way , you still got
your weapons fold
Swear to god , i cant wait to stab
that motherfucker
Slice his throat , and bleed him like a pig
Split his intestins out in the dirt
Beat him in the head with a baseball bat
until his fuckin eye-balls fall out.
If you wanna do it ..i'll do it.
I'll cut the fucker for you .
I'll do it.. I'll fuckin..i'll kill.
I'll ... do it , if you wanna do it .
So weird ..This shit's so weird ..
Hey, Derek.
-Hey, aunt Mo.
You're still here Ali ?
Dont you have a baby to take care of ?
She's on her way back . mom.
She should get her stuff and go , then.
You guys dont work ,dont go to school ,
dont do anything ..
All you do is lay around .. drive your cars..
You know how that makes me feel ?
Mad.
What the fuck are we gonna do now ..?
-Just calm the fuck down.
You're not with Ali , are you?
-No , Ali's someone i hate.
You've always had common sense.
I'm glad that you are hanging out with Lisa.
I'm surprised , but glad.
You like her friends ?
I dont know.
I mean they get crazy and stuff sometimes , but ..
I'm just like hanging out ..
-Good.
You know , when we lived in the Bronx
at least we had family ..
Family kept things tight and safe.
Down here in Florida , nobody's tight .
Everybody's just ... whatever
Dont Ali's parents wander where she is ?
I'm going over to your mother's .
Play some cards.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I just .. i love you Ali ,
i truely love you.
Me too, Ali.
You know we are gonna be okay , guys .. you know ?
We'll get this shit behind us ..
We gonna be back , in time , in Palm Bay ,
for Donny's birthday at his mom's house.
Shit, i never knew nobody who killed somebody.
Me neither.
Just my grandpa.. i never knew him.
My grandpa was a bad junk .. really bad.
He'd rape anyone dumb
enough to walk by his room ...
One night, he got , really pissed on my grandma,
he need to take a climb on to her face,
And , after that,he just , he locked himself up
with her in his room , for two whole days
And he just kept drinking and having sex
with her after she's dead.
My mom was in the house the whole time ..
-Fuck...
She was only 15.
Holy shit.
-You know ,it really messed with her head.
After that she only hanged out with guys
who'd beat the hell out of her
And then , when i was little ,she'd get drunk ,
and she'd drag me and my brother out of the bed
at four in the morning , and she had all
the news , clippings , about my grandpa ,
and she'd read them over and over again ..
Then , i knew every word before kindergarden ...
I think that's how i learned to read.
She's gone. We should go.
That chick Ali gave me a blowjob last night,
and i fucked her.
She called again , sais you all going back to Weston ..
Marty?
-Yeah, man, that's the plan.
You going on?
You're my best friend.
Okay, so , we're picking Marty up in 45 minutes .
Derek , what's up with the baseball bat ?
Cmon , we need more weapons.
What's going on ?
-I dont know.
My mom'd say something?
-No.
It's just .. Nevermind , everything's ok.
My back hurts.
Derek, would you give me a masage ?
Me too, my back hurts too...
I want a masage.
Harder.
-Like that?
Whatch it!
I guess...
I guess i'll go and do something about the bats.
-Good idea.
Okay, just one thing left to do ..
-Whats that?
The hitman needs a ride.
Where you going tonight , Bob ?
-Going out with my friend.

lean'em off somewhere , and then we'll sneak him from behind ..
And you give the signal .
-And then what ?
Then we kill him.

to them , and shit ,
When you see that everything's ok , and he
doesnt suspect shit,
the you yell out:
"Are there any aligators down there?"
When we'll hear that we'll know it's time.
Aligators in there ?
-In the canal !
It's a signal.Just say something about aligators ,
all right? Then we'll do him .
Say aligators ...and then you'll come.
Yeah.It's a signal.
You go down like you're her boyfriend,..hold her
hand or some shit,
When you hear that signal , do it ..
-So, go !.
What do you want me to do ?
-Back him up..
We'll block him from up here ,
So he cant get away.
Are there any aligators in there ?

You'd better turn out.

You shouldnt feel bad, Ali ..
I mean , he deserved to die.
He would have hurt you ..or your baby..
What do you mean ..?
-I dont know.
I dont think you should have a guilt trip ,

the tire tracks ,
people might have left other shit out there , we
freaked .. we left too fast.
We cant fuckin go back there ..
-We're not asking you.
Ali.
You're his best friend , so you're gonna be
his number one suspect.
Dude , that does not make sense .. i should be the
last motherfucker to suspect ..
No , you're not a cop. You dont know how these sick
bastards think , it's like -
they suspect you more , even if you're the most
innocent seemin person in the world .
The more innocent you seem, the more the get of
fucking with you ,..you know ?
We're in here.
Do you think- Shh
Ready ?
Lets make this shit fast, cause those police plans
they stealth here-
looking for raves , and vandals and shit.

-Any luck?
Yeah, lets get the fuck outa here.
-No, we need to see if he's still there.
What the fuck are you talkin about ?
-No man , we're here right fuckin now-
We need to see if anybody's found him yet.
Over here.
What the fuck is that?
-Crabs.They're eating him.
That's fuckin sick,..
Nature sucks.
There's blood on my shoe ..
There's blood on my fuckin shoe !
Some dog is gonna come down, and dig this stuff up ,
you know people do this ,
it's illegal , but they do it anyway , and the
lifeguards dont do shit.
If someone find this stuff ,with the blood ...
Shut up, Lisa.
You didnt do anything ..
I was there, you didnt do anything .. okay ..
And i definetely didnt .
What? I didnt kill anybody, i just went along for the ride.
-You fuckin drowned the guy.

motherfucker was gonna beat the shit outa me.
I didnt do shit.
-Neither did i.
You stabbed him first , asshole.. -Oh , fuck you man ,

What about the other 10 times ?
Goddamn it Lisa , gimme the bat back , it's

Where are the knives?
I threw them in the ocean.
-You threw the in the ocean? where in the ocean?
She's crazy..she thinks she's gonna be caught.
I didnt do shit , if anyone's gonna get caught it's
gonna be you-
you stabbed him first
-Shut up, i didnt do shit !
So we've been talkin about getting caught and who
did what, great talk, i think we need to have that talk ..
By the way , what have you decided ?
You, doper,what do you think , did you kill
that motherfucker?
No.I stabbed the dude,i admit that, everyone saw me
fuckin do that , but i didnt actually kill him,
he was still alive after i finished stickin him ..
And you?
You know i didnt kill him ...
-Then who helped me drown the s.o.b then?
He was dead already!
-Oh he was dead?
I just picked him up to help you move him ,i-
..I didnt fuckin kill anybody ..
-Ladies?
Oh, of course not .. you have nothing to
do with it ,you are just 'our dates' .. correct ?
Well me and mister Marty have spoken , on the way to
retrieving the sheet to the knife
that we left at the murder scene. You guys do
understand that we've murdered somebody tonight-
we took your friends life. I just wanna make
sure that we're on the same page here ..
I know you've been fuckin smokin ,you're just havin your
thrills and shit, but this is no fuckin video game-
Your friend , that you've been so fucking pissed at ,
he's like faced down in the swamp now ,
with his fuckin eyes hanging out in the sand,
and the sand crabs eating them.
I dont intend on going down for this shit, so if any
of you take me down for this shit i will kill his ass-
or her ass. So we're gonna sit here ,
on this beach,right now,
and work out this alibi until i am
satisfied with it.
You've reached the Kent's , please leave your name and number,
and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
Bobby, this is Marty Puccio.
I called you.
You asked me to call when i got home, so i'm calling ..
They'll think that i'm guilty of it ?
- I guess...
You stabbed him in the heart, you were on top
of him..
..he was on his back.
No shit Lis',i got that Mafia guy with a baseball
bat telling me what to fuckin' do every minute.
Yeah, that's true.I mean , i guess they'd
say he did it.
No shit Lis', the guy blasted his fuckin brains out
with a ball bat.
Oh, shit ..!
That was so gross !..
It was so sick !..
You think i could get in trouble ?
-For what?
For being there..like an accessory.
They could say you were a witness or
smth, but that's about it.
That's no big deal.
So, how do you feel?
-What, about getting caught?
Shit, it's like a heavy
weight got lifted off me.
We did it.
..killed the guy.
Hey man , i've heard-
What the fuck you talkin about ?
-Fatalize..man..
I dont know man ,..it's like..
i'm just so tight..
I cant sleep ..or do shit..
It's like-
I'm worried they are gonna find some shit that
is gonna give us all away ..you know, like-
get caught.
I'm so fucked !.. I just ..
cant stop thinking about it.
You didnt kill that dude, did you ?
-No! Hell no, i didnt have shit to do with it.
But i was ,like, there , so some would consider
that i was a witness or some shit..
And i dont know ,man, like maybe you know that something
like this happened, and dont tell the cops-
than maybe they have some fuckin law,
that can get you in trouble, you know-
like leaving the scene of an accident ,
without never reporting it..you know-
They have that in driver's aid.
- I know.
Shit!..
It's just..i need an alibi, man.
I need someone to say i was with them the
whole time, so-
that could be like:  "No, i wasnt anywhere near
those assholes that night..anywhere near them.."
Say this to who?
-To the cops.
I need someone to say i was with them.
What kind of asshole is gonna lie to the
cops about a murder ?
Hey Lisa ..what's up?
You're not gonna belive this shit Claudia ..
you're not gonna fuckin believe it.
We killed Bobby.
-Pardon me?
We killed him.He's dead.
We did it.
You should've seen it. Marty stuck him
right in the heart..
Lisa, what are you talking about?
You know that guy, Donny? The looser,..
you met him.
He stuck him right in the back of his
fuckin head.
Lisa.. what?!
It was so weird,..this hitman,right, he
takes this baseball bat-
and right when Bobby's on the ground,he's like
gurgling like a baby, shootin blood-
and his guts were like , hanging out of him..
It was so sick, his eyes were
like popping out of his head..
He just takes his baseball bat and he swings it ..
it was half way into his head.
You watched this? -Yeah, i was there ,
and Ali and Heather..we were all there
We saw it..most of it
Heather..you met her, right ?
She's so strange..You know, she gets this blank look
like she's not even there..and she starts huggin her knees-
Like shes totally fright. And after ..
she shrugs and says : "Fuck him .."
Lisa...
-Yeah, listen, Claudia
I'm real worried about how we left him ,
he's just out there where anyone can see him,
I cant stop thinkin about it ..you know ,
Like someone's just walking there ,
finding him ..
We shoud've pushed him into the canal more ,
At least the gators would've got him ,
or he would've sunk or something but-
That's why i came over.
-What?!
Well, Claudy, i need to go out there, can i borrow
your mother's car? i need a ride-
I need someone to help me move it.
-It?
The body.
-You murdered Bobby Kent ?
I didnt say i murdered anybody.
They killed him.
I didnt even say they murdered him,i mean,
he was fighting back-
He was? -Yeah, he was tryin to get away..
begging Marty , you know..like sayin:
"I'm sorry.Please i'll do anything,
just dont kill me."
And then right when he said that,
Marty just walked up to him, and-
wacked him in the heart with his knife.
The whole thing was just
totally totally extreme.
Wait..you want somebody to take you out there
to move the body ?
Anybody that's crazy enough to do that ..
-Fine.., we wont move it-
we'll just go out there and see if the tire
tracks are gone.
No way Lisa..No way.
-Come on..
No! Look Lisa, i gotta go ,
i'm late for work,
I'm supposed to be in Pizza Hut in half an hour.
-Screw you , Claudia!..
All i wanted was a ride.. I hope you have a
problem some day, so you can ask me for help-
..i mean , shit..
You dont have to make a fuckin federal case out
of it just 'cause i asked for a fuckin ride ..
Claudia, keep your fuckin mouth shut.
No shit Lisa.
Is that Lisa leaving..? -Yeah.
Is everything okay? -Yeah.
What's going on?
-Nothing.
What are you up to?
-Nothing.
Look, i gotta go to work , mom.
Mom, what if you witnessed a crime.., like
a murder, and-
you just called the hotline..without giving
your name or anything-
would that be legal ?
-I dont know what you mean , Ali.
What kind of a crime?
-A murder.i told you ..
What are you kids up to, Ali?
-Nothing,i mean i'm just asking ..
would it still count if you report it , right ?
If you saw a murder honey, and you just call
the hotline,report it-
and you didnt give your name or anything..
would that be enough?
Would it? -Well..i dont know the law,
but i dont think so.
I think you'd still have to say who you were ..
Why are you asking me these questions?
-Why wouldnt it count?
You'd still say..you reported it , right?
Ali , are you talking about a murder-murder?
-I guess. This guy kinda got killed.
Why would you just call the hotline?
-I'm just asking ..,god,..
Marty, where've you been?
-Some anonymous called the cops.
They know about Bobby.
-They found him?
I dont know..Somebody told
them he got murdered.
Murdered?
-Yeah.
They used that word?
-Yes.
Did you fuckin talk to somebody?
-I didnt fuckin talk to anybody!..,Jesus,..
You got up early..
-Yeah, i'm going skateboarding.
What you did with the ear?
-I fell out.
I love you buddy.
-Yeah, i love you too.
Who the fuck did you tell, Lisa? -It wasnt me, bitch..
For all i know, it was you, whatever...
The cops are on to us, we have to come up there,..
-Not with the police on you , you dont.
You gotta hide us.. I mean they know how
Bobby died and everything.
I mean we're all in this together, right ?
Alice Jean!
I dont want them to know where i sleep.
-This is going to stop right now.
Then i want my own apartment then.
-An apartment...
God fuckin damn it , we need to hide ,cause
they're gonna come up,
Who are "they"? -Ali thinks that some of
her friends killed somebody.
What the hell, Virginia,we have
to call somebody from the police.
No police, cause a Mafia hitman
did this so..
He said that if we tell
anybody he's gonna kill us-
Is this about getting your own apartment?
-No !! ,i dont need no apartment!
Dont touch me!
Ali, chill.
That's it.
We're not in the fuckin Mafia.
-The way you talking,.he must be protecting you.
Protecting me ? I'm his brother..
This fucker protect dick..
We have a job..
What about the crazy-motherfuckers?
-He wanted to be like daddy was, but he chickened out.
Anyways, you ought to turn yourselves in.
If i turn myself in, i may go to jail.
She's afraid they'd put her in jail.
-Tell her you'll write to her.
I'll write to you.
Police. Where's Marty?
Sheriff's Office.Dont move.Where's Marty?
-In the bedroom.
Sheriff's Office. -What's going on?
Do the name Bobby Kent tell you smth?
I'll have a child in 7 weeks.If it's a
boy i'm gonna name him Marty.
Will you send me a picture?
-Yeah.
I dont think you have to have it.
-Shut up bitch...you're nothing but a fuckin snitch.
We had a deal,.we all know that.
Is it true, Heather?
-Shit Ali, you dont know that yet?
Jesus..who's your lawyer?
That dumbo snitched on us to save
her own life,
Snitch motherfucker..i know that you did it.
Leave him the fuck alone, asshole,
Shut the fuck up you little bitch ..It's your fat
cousin here that turned us in.
I dont even know what i'm doing here ..
