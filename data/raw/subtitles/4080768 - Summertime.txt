SUMMERTIME
- You didn't take any corn at all?
- No.
Antoine's parents are
starting to plant it.
Sweetie, the day you have a husband,
you can ask him to plant corn.
But if you keep letting
them go one after another...
Your friends are faster.
I don't want to get married.
I don't want to get married.
What are you doing every night?
Getting home in the middle of the night.
I walk around.
Are you seeing anyone?
No.
- Is it Antoine?
- No.
You can't stay alone all your life.
Solitude is awful.
I'm getting married in September.
Who to?
Pierre Coubin.
You love him?
I don't know.
I don't really know him. I mean,
I've known him all my life, but I
don't know if he'll make a good husband.
He seems nice.
He's ambitious, he wants
to go live in Limoges.
Oh, yeah, very ambitious.
Do you want to stay here all your life?
Yeah.
I like everything here.
We need to move on, Delphine.
We're not kids anymore.
What happened between
us doesn't matter to you?
It does.
Of course it does, but,
it wasn't serious.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, just walking.
You?
- You want it?
- No, thanks.
You'll get caught someday.
Will you go to the dance in Aubusson?
Dunno.
We could go together.
I don't know, Antoine.
We'll see.
Where's Delphine?
I don't know.
Delphine.
Delphine?
Delphine?!
PARIS SPRING 1971
The President welcomed, this
morning at the Ã‰lysée Palace,
11 mothers, with at
least 10 children each.
Mr. Pompidou awarded them the
Medal of the French Family.
And during an improvised speech, the
president spoke about the role of family.
"Raising kids is a lot of
work but it's rewarding. "
"The notion of family is
threatened by the current climate. "
"A climate emphasized by the
violence spreading everywhere. "
"France can't become a dictatorship,
but the government must
act to stop this violence. "
Hey!
- Hey, you're having fun?
- Yeah, it's your time for once!
- You're laughing now?
- Leave her alone!
Tarts!
Close the door!
Sluts!
Go fuck yourself!
You see how he acted?
If we had stolen his
wallet, he'd run the same.
We did worse than steal his
wallet. We stole his virility.
Thank god you were here.
- You don't scare easily!
- He was threatening.
- He wasn't that dangerous.
- Really?
He was crazy.
Was it a dare?
No, it was to show them how it feels.
When it's our arse it's normal, when
it's theirs, they don't like it so much.
- Next time we do it to cops!
- Yeah!
What do you demonstrate for?
Women's rights.
The right to not be bothered
in the street for starters.
The right to do what we want, when we
want it, and with whoever we want to.
Don't you agree?
I don't know.
You don't feel like there
are things you can't do
because you're a woman?
I'm looking for a meeting, but
I don't really know about what.
All I know is that there's
women, and it's on Thursdays.
Oh, the hotheads? It's in the
lecture theater on the right.
You're being sectarian!
Our strength is to blend.
What men need to understand
is that for now, they don't belong here!
And I know what people'll say.
They'll say we're against men.
But we're not. We're not!
Besides, half the women
here are involved with a guy.
We're not against men,
we're for the women! For us!
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry but when there's a guy
around, a woman's attitude changes.
Her speech is different.
And even an educated woman,
when she's around a man,
whether she knows him or not,
she censors her speech and her thoughts.
What we want right now, is
to get back our free speech
without caring what the boyfriend,
boss or dad will think of it,
and talk between women.
OK, I agree with the separatism,
but in this case, there's a journalist
who wants to attend our meeting...
Down with the straight journalism!
Let everyone talk!
If even within Women's Lib
we can't agree, we're doomed!
Men in the kitchen, women at the bar!
â™ª Us who don't have history â™ª
â™ª from time immemorial, women â™ª
â™ª we're the dark continent â™ª
â™ª slave women, get up â™ª
â™ª and let's break our chains â™ª
â™ª Get up, get up, get up â™ª
â™ª women enslaved and humiliated â™ª
â™ª bought, sold and raped â™ª
â™ª women in every house â™ª
â™ª are kept out of the world â™ª
â™ª slave women, get up â™ª
â™ª and let's break our chains â™ª
â™ª Get up, get up, get up â™ª
I really didn't envision you
sitting at a desk all day long.
I envisionned you...
doing something more physical.
Oh yeah? Like what?
Swimming teacher.
Yeah, you'd be good at that.
You need to be serious,
focused, and it's physical.
- And what do you do?
- Guess.
It's too difficult, I barely know you.
You have two attempts,
then you'll have a forfeit.
Saleswoman?
No, I'm not a saleswoman.
Last attempt.
Um... doctor?
Why do you think that?
Well, you speak well, so
it means you studied,
and you seem to care about others.
- Forget it, it's stupid.
- No, not at all.
I'm a teacher.
Spanish teacher.
So, what's the forfeit?
You must come to the
next meeting Thursday.
Ah.
It's a strong sentence,
but we have to compromise.
We're talking about people who
never speak about themselves.
There's no union for prisoners,
so if we don't represent them
there's no point.
You know how feeble
bourgeois journalists are.
Le Monde won't accept it.
If we don't stir up a hornets' nest...
How many articles about
French prisons are there?
- Zero.
- We'll be the first ones,
and it'll be shot down. It's stupid.
We're not gonna censure
ourselves until Fauvert does it.
What's our goal here? To publish a good
article, or to be published in Le Monde?
Being published in Le Monde
would gives it importance.
We have something to say, we worked for
a year, and in order to be published,
we're gonna write what they want to read?
If it's just a reported speech,
it's pointless. It's demagogic!
Demagogic? Really?
Of course it is.
Prison creates new criminals.
That's what we think.
Can you take my blue dress too?
Put it aside though, so I don't have
to search for hours in your mess.
I know, I need to clean up.
- I don't have enough time.
- Oh, yeah, it's hard to do everything,
free your sisters from the male
superiority and clean your clothes.
Yeah.
What would I do without you?
Women can't live without men.
Chauvinist.
- Shrew.
- Boor.
- Virago.
- Supporter of slavery.
Suffragette.
- Pompidou's voter.
- Ah, no, no.
- No names!
- You didn't answer so you lost.
No, no, no, you're
cheating. You're cheating!
- A punishment for you!
- Go ahead.
I won, I won.
Hey.
Delphine, you're here.
You missed a lot.
We laughed so much at Ménie Grégoire.
Everyone went on the set.
People were screaming,
- "Liberty! Liberty!"
- Ah, Delphine.
Hey.
- How are you?
- I'm good, you?
I'm telling her about Ménie Grégoire.
Oh la la, it was something!
I thought she'd faint.
Wanna try?
The magazine really
doesn't stick its neck out.
They say: "The 343 sluts:
it's either courage or exhibitionism. "
Of course. Like their
article is courageous.
It's OK.
- Sorry.
- It's OK. It's OK.
"We're calling on our sisters:
Let's demand, hand in
hand, appropriate wages,
on par with the work
produced, and equal to men;
that women stop being treated as objects.
Meeting in Amphitheater B, April 23."
How are we doing with the banners?
On the fourth.
We need more, right?
- Maybe one.
- Yeah, it'll be better.
â™ª This is the final orgasm â™ª
â™ª Let us sleep, and tomorrow â™ª
â™ª Dykes and queers â™ª
â™ª Will be the human race â™ª
- You OK?
- Yeah.
You're on the pill?
No.
Why? Are you crazy?
You have to. I keep
saying so to my students.
Discreetly though, I
don't want to get fired.
Why don't you take it? You
think it's too expensive?
- No, that's not it.
- My duty as a doctor,
is to do everything possible
to help a human life.
Whoever he is,
regardless of race,
sex, religion... and if we
don't make any distinction
based on race, religion or sex,
why should we make one based on age?
What if one day we say that our seniors
aren't humans, so we can simply kill them.
No, no. Medicine isn't
on the side of death.
It's on the side of life.
So when women have the
chance to be with child,
but still want to abort,
I want to tell them:
"Be responsible. When you drive a car,
you respect the traffic laws.
Well, pregnant women and
their little passenger,
it's life. It's a child to be born. "
- My body is not a car!
- Here, a human life!
What's going on?
- Enough!
- Your mother should have done
- everyone a favor and abort!
- Asshole!
Fascist!
Stick it!
What are you doing?
Hurry up!
- For a free abortion law.
- Just don't fuck.
- You didn't fuck?
- Of course, but I was careful.
- How?
- We managed.
"Dear Antoine. Paris really
is an incredible city. "
"Even though I hadn't realized it
before. Every day is different. "
So much is happening here.
"I met a great girl. "
"A great girl. "
"An amazing girl. "
"A fantastic girl. "
"Her name's Carole. "
Sorry, I probably got the wrong door.
- You're here for the meeting?
- Yes.
It's the right door. Come in.
- Get out!
- I'm being kicked out of my own place now.
We don't need you anymore.
- See ya.
- See ya.
- You good?
- Yeah.
- Isn't this Carole's?
- It is.
Carole and Manuel's. The boudoir.
He's not crazy at all. He is
a specialist in literature,
he is super smart, very funny.
But he's queer. So his fucking parents
put him in a mental institution
to cure him. Long live family.
Adeline, for us it's a no,
we don't deal with such cases, that's all.
We have to stay on point:
abortion, contraception,
otherwise we're gonna divide ourselves.
So I should leave my best friend there
enduring electroshocks,
and maybe a lobotomy,
just because it's not what we
fight for, and it's too far away?
That's not what we said.
Wait, it's legal to do that to someone?
Yes it's legal, and that's the problem.
Put a queer in a mental
institution is legal.
So, what's your plan?
My plan's easy. We go
there and we grab him.
I'm sorry, Adeline, but it's not our
business to handle men's problems.
We're not gonna start messing
with minority groups' struggles.
Minority? You've got a nerve to say that.
I fight for the pill, but it's not my
girlfriend's who's gonna knock me up.
- I'm really disappointed in you guys.
- Don't take it personally.
We pick the fights, we have to be
coherent. We can't disperse like that.
It doesn't have to be done
under the Women's Lib's flag.
- Obviously.
- Well, that's it then.
I don't get it. Adeline is
always the first to support you,
she always sticks with you no matter what,
she was there for Chambart, and
you can't even be there for her?
Thanks a lot. Thank you.
It's her best friend, seriously.
- Carole, come on, you're coming?
- I don't know.
What? Do you need your
boyfriend's approval?
What's up with you?
- You don't go, but I will.
- It's stupid.
One group goes to Plessis-Robinson,
the other one goes to grab your friend.
Why did you change your mind?
I'm going to be there for my friend.
That's a very good reason.
So, you go this way.
- And the second right...
- On the map, we're there.
But I was thinking about
taking this blue path.
- No, you can't. That's a stream.
- Ah.
Maybe if you row, but
otherwise, I don't think so.
I'm sorry, my husband always
says I can't read a map.
- Yes.
- We're gonna make it.
We're here, and the castle's there.
- No, madam, look.
- Where are we? We're here, right?
Not at all, Mrs.
Give me your hand.
Hey!
- Stop!
- Go, go, go!
Where are you going?
I can't open my eyes anymore.
- Hello, auntie.
- Hello, sweetie.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
- I'm happy to see you.
- Me too.
- This is my aunt: HéIÃ¨ne.
- Hello, ma'am.
- What's going on?
- Just a little accident.
Nothing serious.
- Are you sure?
- We made a crazy turn.
- You want anything to drink?
- Oh, yes, please, good idea.
You OK, Guitou?
He's coming back.
Here we are.
Here.
I've never been in the south before.
It's weird.
Don't drag too much.
No, not that, the landscape.
It's different back home.
It always feels like the soil is drenched.
Here when you walk,
the soil is hard.
Your foot bounces back,
it gives you momentum.
Back home, even in the summer,
your foot sinks in.
As if the soil was going to swallow it.
As if you have to fight just to walk.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
We're out of sleeping bags.
I never fought with a man,
it's always with women back at the dojo.
Cheers.
In the country, it's
like an unwritten law.
- Here, taste this.
- Thank you.
For example, my mother
doesn't have a salary,
no social security, no checkbook.
But she works all day long.
And when a decision must
be made about the farm,
- she doesn't have a say.
- It's crazy.
Shift your weight back, push him forward,
you pin him and you do an armlock.
- Oh.
- Do that really fast.
If you do that, he can't move.
Why didn't you say something
during the meetings?
I thought no one would be
interested to hear about it.
Are you kidding? Everyone would
have loved to hear about it.
That's exactly against such
things we're fighting for.
- Adeline.
- No, wait, wait.
- I'm embarrassed.
- Why?
Thanks.
I don't want to talk about
it in front of everyone.
Can I sleep in your bed?
Adeline snores like a trooper.
Sure.
Thanks.
What?
The situation at the farm can't
keep going. You need to take it back.
You need to do
a farmers collective or
something. Something unique.
- Did you smoke again?
- Barely.
What?
I never said I wanted to
kick my dad out of the farm.
You're a chicken.
- No.
- Yes, like most women.
Men still have a bright future.
What are you doing?
Go away, Carole. Go sleep elsewhere.
It's OK, it's no big deal.
- We drank too much.
- No, you drank too much.
Go away, Carole!
"I was sixteen and a half.
I was in a coed high school.
I was sick, and I didn't have
my period, so a friend told me:
'You're pregnant. ' She gave me
the address of a doctor in Pigalle.
The first time I went to see him,
he was on a first name basis with me.
He told me, 'You're one month pregnant. '
I was panicked and completely disoriented.
He asked me: 'What are you
gonna do?' I had no idea.
I didn't want to get married.
I didn't have a boyfriend.
The father was in La Rochelle,
I had no way to reach him... "
Hello.
Hey.
You weren't at the meeting yesterday.
No, I didn't feel like it.
Look, I wanted to tell
you about last time,
I'm not shocked, not at all.
I...
I was just taken aback.
But...
I mean...
I have lesbian friends,
but I'm not, that's all.
Me neither.
I'm taking the banners.
- Well, you're pretty late.
- Yeah, yeah, don't tell me off.
I don't. Take the banners instead.
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
We can make the first trip.
Put everything in the car.
We need to be first in the rally.
Who's taking that?
Delphine.
Let's go to your place.
What the hell are you talking about?
Is it to prove to yourself
you're a free woman?
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I didn't wake up one morning thinking
"Oh, today I'm sleeping with a girl. "
It happened, that's all.
I thought it'd only be a one-time thing.
- But it's lasting, and...
- What? You want to break up?
No, otherwise I wouldn't
tell you about it.
Is it just a sex thing or are you in love?
I don't know, Manuel.
I don't know.
Are you seeing her today?
I don't know.
You're lying.
I know you.
You dislike lying so much, when
you have, you become all yellow.
I swear.
It's not a sure thing, but
we might see each other.
OK.
Find a place to spend the night then.
You're not coming in our
bed after you fucked her.
No!
Calm down, calm down, calm down.
Bad girl.
Shh.
Oh, come on.
Down with the bourgeoise society!
Te quiero.
- Te quiero.
- Te quiero?
Mi amor.
Mi amor.
Me gustan tus pechos.
- What does it mean?
- Repeat it.
- Me gustan...
- Tus pechos.
- Tus pechos.
- Good.
Me gustan... what does it mean.
Nothing.
- That's the "pechos"?
- Yes!
Ah, the pechos. Yeah,
me gustan tus pechos.
You've got it, my love!
Hey.
Hello. Miss Vinatier?
- Yes.
- I have a telegram for you.
I don't get it.
If he was tired, why didn't he stop?
He didn't look tired, he was like usual.
I didn't see it coming.
Just the day before,
he was running around.
You know how he is.
Then, yesterday morning,
he was loading some cans,
and I saw him fall on the ground.
The doctors told me,
there's no warning signs
for that type of thing.
We're lucky he's still here.
Does it look like we're lucky?
It's hard for me too.
I...
I thought about it, and
I don't have a choice.
I don't have a brother,
an uncle or a cousin. If I
don't do it, no one else will.
Are you crazy? You can't cut
yourself off again out there.
It's too much for my mom!
And we can't afford a farm hand.
We're just starting something you and I...
You can't tell me that over the phone
like that, Delphine. We need to meet.
I'm on my way. Where are you?
Not now, Carole.
It's OK.
I'm sure she's gonna come back.
She loves you, it's obvious.
What's going on?
I waited here, because
she's not feeling well.
Did you know the Liéjard brothers
are ready to buy your farm?
Your father had been at the
hospital for less than a day,
and they were already talking
about it to your mother.
Bunch of jerks.
She didn't even tell him. In their dreams!
You changed.
I did?
Yeah, I don't know.
You look less childish, more woman.
Or maybe more Parisian.
That's funny. In Paris, I
always felt like a ninny,
and you tell me I look more Parisian.
You know,
I'm really sorry about Maurice.
But I'm really happy you're here.
Stop going through your father's
things, he doesn't like it.
I have a meeting with the bank.
Why?
To pay the share.
Do you have a health insurance policy?
No. We're not gonna pay two of them.
We're not as rich as the Giscards.
Seven letters.
- How many letters?
- We're going to have to shell out.
Guys, regarding the purchase
of the agricultural equipment:
we're only getting a combine harvester,
- every agrees?
- Yes.
I think it's too expensive.
We should renegotiate the price.
- You're getting cold feet again?
- No, I'm not!
But we're not as rich as Croesus.
Once we've settled on the model we want,
we'll calculate everybody's share,
and we'll get your checks.
- I'll come pick everyone's check...
- Yeah, Antoine will pick them up.
- OK for everyone?
- About Maurice, what do we do?
I'll pay our share.
So, if you pay the share,
I'll have to schedule a
bank appointment for you.
No, that's fine. I have an
appointment early next week.
You took an appointment on your own?
Well, yeah.
It's my role as president of the
cooperative so you should have told me,
and we would have come with you.
You would have been more credible.
I thought it would be faster that way.
Maybe, but that's not how we do it.
It's not correct.
Well, if the appointment
is scheduled, we'll see...
- So...
- We need to appoint drivers too.
Your father woke up!
- What?
- Your father woke up!
They say he's still weak,
but he's conscious. He doesn't
speak but he can understand.
Don't take that many, you're
only leaving for a few days.
He loves the wild boar one.
You know he's a big eater.
Ouch. We look like two
little girls running around.
Kiss him hello for me.
- If you have a problem, call Antoine.
- Yeah, don't worry.
Kiss him for me!
You said working the
land was non-stop work,
but it feels OK to me.
That's because I woke up at 4:00 am
to do everything before you arrive.
Really? You must be exhausted.
No, I'm OK. I still have energy.
What kind of energy?
Come on, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Come on, Laura!
Stop! Stop!
Come on, Margot!
What's missing... ah, the jug of water.
When I was a kid, we'd play house,
and I didn't feel anything
when I kissed boys.
One day, there weren't enough
boys, so I played the dad.
I kissed a girl and it
really made an impression.
And then?
Then I slept with a
girl for the first time.
How old were you?
I was 16 and she was 22.
Was she from around here?
No, a city girl, like you.
She was on holidays near our place.
My parents were completely
in the dark. They were happy
that I made friends with a
college girl, from Limoges.
And then?
What "then"?
Don't make me believe there was no
one between your 16 years old and now.
I had a heartache with a girl from here.
And then I met you.
I knew it.
I knew it, but I couldn't
believe you'd do that.
You're pathetic.
You say you're confused,
that you don't wanna break up,
and ten days later you go join her for
the weekend, without even warning me.
You must be joking.
Are you waiting for my approval?
You have no self-discipline, Carole.
None.
Commitment is not just in the
amphitheater with your friends.
It's in your life too.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Let's get him out.
Help me.
Give me his bathrobe.
Thank you.
No need to thank me.
Are you certain of what you're doing?
I just left her and I already miss her.
I really miss her, you know?
I never felt this way
before. So I'm going back,
I don't have a choice.
I never wanted for you to miss me.
What I loved about you is
that you didn't need me,
that you were free, and strong.
So what are you saying now?
That love, for you, is not being
able to stay apart from someone?
Chasing someone, tongue
rolling out, like in cartoons?
- That's not you, Carole.
- Maybe.
I don't know anymore,
I just let myself drift
away by my feelings.
I don't want to debate about this.
You don't have to stop thinking either.
Mom?
A friend from Paris will come visit
us for a few days, if you don't mind.
I don't. Quite the opposite actually.
It's good for you, it'll
take your mind off things.
Between handling the farm and your
father, you deserve some entertainment.
Is she a colleague of yours?
Yeah.
She just left her boyfriend,
so she needs to take a break.
- Do they have kids?
- No.
Oh, it's easier then.
She'll take Grandma's bedroom.
It's the most comfortable one.
Oh my god!
I gotta warn you, we won't
sleep in the same room.
Why?
My dad just had a heart
attack a month ago,
I don't want my mom to have one as well.
We're gonna take it easy, OK?
OK.
Dad.
This is Carole, she came to see me.
Hello, sir.
Delphine told me a lot about you,
I'm really glad to meet you.
See you later.
What kind of work do
you do at Félix Potin?
Oh, but I don't work at Félix Potin at all.
Well, I thought...
I'm a Spanish teacher.
We met at a women's group.
What kind of group?
Uh, a pottery group, just for women.
They're workshops around the material.
We work on the feelings,
we sculpt, we knead.
We work with clay.
It's pleasurable, and very relaxing.
You do that kind of thing?
Oh yeah, and she's very gifted.
She makes cute little vases, you'll see.
- Right, Delphine?
- Hmm.
Is that dessert? Can I?
- I'm gonna get you a plate.
- Oh no, don't bother.
Shh.
- Up already?
- Yeah.
- You didn't sleep well?
- I did, but I'm coming with you.
- We're gonna go work.
- I know.
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
That's no work for a teacher.
Oh, am I too slow?
No, no. It's just that if I
didn't have to do it, I wouldn't.
Really?
- But you're proud of what you do?
- Proud? No.
Why would I be?
You and your daughter manage to keep
the farm running, that's not nothing.
It's the proof that a farm
can be managed by women.
It's true that women are
as good as men for work,
but that's not how it's done.
- What?
- Nothing.
Here.
It's easier with a man, don't you agree?
I didn't say anything.
What do you have against men?
What?
- What?
- Nothing...
What you do is marvelous.
You should be proud, Monique.
Got it.
Look.
Touch it.
Ah, Monique!
Come dance!
â™ª tu m'allumes, le matin tu m'éteins â™ª
- You're not tired?
- Come on!
Come on, Monique.
Come on, come on. Come on, Monique.
Come on, come on.
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.
â™ª Mon chéri â™ª
â™ª Hello chéri â™ª
â™ª Toi, tu me fais de I'électricité, â™ª
â™ª Tu fais monter ma tension, Monique â™ª
â™ª... I'électrici... â™ª
â™ª Moi, I'électrici...
Moi, I'électricité â™ª
Monique!
You're awesome.
I didn't even touch you yet.
- Did you feel it?
- No.
You see.
- And now?
- No.
- Did you tell him we made hay?
- He doesn't understand what we say.
Of course he does. Right, Dad?
We made hay.
We have to talk to him.
That's what keeps him alive.
You can bury your head in
the sand. I see what I see.
Sorry. Here.
Do it!
Come on, Delphine!
- To Delphine being back, and welcome to...
- Carole.
I'm Josette. To Carole and Delphine.
Cheers.
- So, was it good in Paris?
- Yeah.
- I did unexpected things.
- Like what?
Politics.
Politics?
You're gonna do a kolkhoz?
Maybe not a cooperative, but making sure
women get a salary for the work
they do would be a great start.
I do have a salary. My husband's salary.
It's already nice that
she can dip into it, no?
Yes.
It seems nice.
Do you want a drink?
No, thanks. I can't right now.
Well, I feel like drinking tonight.
It's well deserved, look.
Practice makes perfect.
How long have you known Delphine?
Since forever.
What was she like as a kid?
Like now.
You know, you can't know
someone in just three months.
Delphine won't leave.
Really?
How can you be certain?
Have you seen Maurice?
He'll never be able to handle the farm.
And Delphine would rather
die than sell it. I know that.
â™ª together oppressed, women â™ª
â™ª together we revolt â™ª
- â™ª get up â™ª
- Shh.
You're gonna wake up my folks.
I doubt I'll wake up your dad.
Hello!
Stop, please.
Sorry, we drank a little bit too much.
"Relax, we're gonna work
on our own today. I love you. "
I can't figure out if Delphine
really likes this life,
or if she can't imagine something else.
I'm sure she could do
a ton of other things.
Your daughter's smart.
But you know that.
She's an egg-head.
You know...
I'm not here to make hay.
Or to be on holidays in the countryside.
I don't care about the countryside at all.
I came here because of your daughter.
Because I love her.
There, I said it.
I'm crazy about her.
I never thought I could
love someone like this.
I've got it.
Delphine.
Don't you miss Paris?
No, not really.
When we met, you seemed to like it.
That's because you were there.
If you had been on Mars, I
would have liked Mars too.
You're a sweet-talker.
I didn't think one day, I'd miss Paris.
The smell of fumes.
The car horns.
The coffee I drink at the
bar before going to work.
Sitting between a worker and a boss,
and everyone has the same
status for five minutes.
I even miss the cops.
Oh no, don't throw all
that. You're wasting it.
- Ah, really?
- Yeah, let me do it.
Hello, Monique.
- Hello, Antoine.
- How are you?
- Hi.
- Hello.
If only...
she were to marry him. That'd be nice.
Why do you say that?
When she left for Paris, I
thought it would never happen.
I thought Antoine would get
bored. But now that she's back...
I don't see what's stopping them.
Did he ask her?
He's waiting for her.
That's his way of asking her.
And are you sure Delphine knows that?
Everybody knows.
And she's got eyes.
Carole, what are you doing? I've
been looking for you everywhere.
Unless I'm abducted by aliens, I
can't see what could happen to me here.
Why are you pissed off?
Do you realize that your mom thinks
you're going to marry Antoine?
Do you realize that?
So what. It makes her happy.
She's allowed to dream.
Yeah, right.
You keep her hoping because
it works out well for you.
What do you want me to say
to her? That we're together?
Yeah! You can't lie to her your whole life.
Maybe she'll stop thinking I'm a Parisian
who wants to get back to nature.
I can't rush her out of nowhere. She
doesn't even know such things exist.
Oh right. Keep thinking
your mom's an idiot.
It's convenient for you.
Carole.
Carole.
Please, open the door.
Carole.
Oh, shut up.
No comments.
What?
What are you trying to do exactly?
Your mom asked me to set this up.
You're doing it wrong.
You're good at that.
Monique is fond of you now.
She's always asking you to do things.
Yeah, she likes me.
It's a good thing she doesn't
know all the dirty we're doing.
Carole.
- Hello.
- Hello.
He's gonna spread rumors around:
"Maurice's daughter is
a lesbian, hide your... "
Stop, it's not funny.
Delphine.
It's stuck.
I can't put my hand in it.
Ah, that's it, I got it.
He's coming, he's coming!
Yes! Yes, come on!
- Come on, girl!
- Keep going!
Yeah.
Yes!
Here you go. Your baby.
You scared us, girl.
It was off to a bad start.
Thanks, Antoine.
- A coffee, Antoine?
- Yes, please.
- Coffee?
- Yeah.
I can't stand it. I'm going home.
Whatever.
Go back to Manuel too.
I left him for you, remember?
Did you ever wonder if
that wouldn't bother me?
- You turning up like this?
- What?
What was I going to tell my folks,
I'm just supposed to be out and proud?
That's small.
That's very small of you.
I'm not like you. I do
care what people think.
Say you're ashamed of
me while you're at it!
Shit, I...
I kept my mouth shut, I
said yes to everything...
It's not other people who look at
you. You're monitoring yourself.
You're your own guardian.
- Your own guardian!
- I can't do everything at once!
I can't manage the farm and be with you!
You keep saying women must be independent.
Well, I fight everyday
so that this farm exists.
- That's concrete!
- Yeah, great! Congrats!
You're a pioneer, good for you!
Great!
You fight more for your farm than for us!
You're heartless, Delphine.
All I sacrificed for you!
Don't you get it?
I'm here for you!
Delphine, you found your place?
Yeah.
- You good?
- Yeah, you?
Have you seen it?
Where were you? We didn't even toast.
It's a nice machine.
Yeah, it's nice.
Kiss me.
- What?
- Kiss me.
Why do you do that?
You have a finger in every pie?
What?
I saw you with your girl friend.
I know why she's here.
What do you mean, what did you see?
Don't take me for a fool,
it's even worse!
Stop.
Antoine.
- Antoine.
- What game are you playing? Huh?
What do you want?
You want me to cover for you?
I won't say a word.
Don't worry about that.
You mean too much for me.
It took you a while to see that machine.
You better?
- Uh?
- Yeah.
My little cowboy.
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK.
It's OK.
Shh.
Delphine.
Delphine.
07:30 am.
- Fuck.
- Well, now she knows.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
It's not happening. Fuck!
Don't fucking laugh!
You weren't awake, so I did the milking.
Thanks.
I forgot the alarm clock.
It won't happen tomorrow.
I hope.
I'm sorry.
- I'm gonna go to the market.
- OK.
That gives you two hours to leave.
When I'm back, it has to be
as if you were never here.
- You think Delphine will be OK with this?
- This is my house!
So I want you to get out, to leave.
- Let's talk about this.
- No.
My daughter's sane. She's a good girl.
You damaged her. You're...
You're nasty.
I'm the same person
you've been working with
all these weeks, Monique.
You didn't think I was nasty back then.
Because I didn't know! You're a liar
- on top of being a pervert!
- Yes, we lied to you.
But Delphine was afraid to hurt you.
And I agreed to lie, because I love her.
Shut up!
Shut up. What are you gonna do now?
You're gonna tell me
the nasty things you did?
All the disgusting
things? I don't wanna know!
It's not disgusting! I'm
talking about your daughter!
Get out! You're the devil in my house!
Stop! Stop it!
- The devil in my house.
- Stop, Monique.
Delphine!
Delphine! I'm leaving!
I'm catching a train, I can't stay here.
I can't...
She threw me out!
Carole.
If you leave, I leave.
I'm coming with you,
Carole. I'm coming with you!
"Mom, I'm leaving with Carole. "
"I was too afraid to tell you about
myself, but I hope one day you'll get it. "
"Forgive me for hurting you. "
"You and Dad will always be in my heart. "
"I'm still your daughter. Delphine. "
Adeline won't believe it.
I'll grab my things,
and we'll find a place.
The connection is in 45 minutes.
There's not even a café around.
I'm so hungry.
When we arrive, I'll take
you to the restaurant.
A great one.
You're not hungry?
Not really.
Carole, I can't.
What?
I don't want to hurt you, but I can't.
That's not possible. You can't
change your mind like this...
in an hour, for something this important.
I can't do it. I can't.
Come with me, I'm begging you.
Delphine.
What was the chance for us to meet?
One in a million?
One in two millions? We were at
the same place at the same time.
If you have gotten in the bus five minutes
earlier, you would have never seen me.
We would have never met. It's a sign!
I do believe in signs!
Let's catch this train.
- Carole.
- We have to go.
Train's coming.
Let's go. Take your suitcase.
Come on.
Delphine!
You missed your train?
No, I came back.
I'm here.
You're back?
And the other one?
Carole is back in Paris, she won't return.
Do your parents know?
- Are you afraid?
- No.
Is it gonna hurt?
No, don't worry.
The doctor is going to
do a suction aspiration.
It's a simple,
less risky, and painless abortion.
You're three weeks, so you
came here at the right time.
Is everything clear to you?
Yes, I think. Thanks.
Now, did you ever think
about going on the pill?
I don't know.
Take a pill every day...
we don't really know what
it does, how it works.
I can explain to you how it works,
that way you'll stop imagining things.
Are you on the pill?
No, I'm not.
Why don't you if it's that good?
I don't take the pill because
I don't need contraception.
I'm with a woman.
You remember Coralie,
- we saw her three weeks ago?
- Mm-hm.
- She's staying at my place.
- Ugh.
Don't "Ugh" me.
She had nowhere to go, and I didn't
want to send her to some shelter.
Sigrid.
You're too nice.
It's a quality too.
One day, you'll let
people walk all over you.
It's only the third time.
But the timing's good, I
was starting to feel lonely.
You OK?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Excuse me a minute.
"Dear Carole,
I hope you get this letter.
I wanted to tell you that
I left my parents' farm.
What I couldn't do when
you were there by my side,
I did it a few years later.
I thought about you a lot.
I follow the movement's news.
I still can't believe
everything you achieved.
Now I wonder what cause you're fighting,
who you're living with, what you became.
I live in the south now.
I've got my own farm.
It's small but it's mine.
I wish I could go back in time.
Go back to that day on the train,
and have the courage I
lacked back then, but...
that's not possible.
I cried a lot after you left.
But at least, I understand that
we can't go back.
We can only move forward.
That's what I'm trying to do now.
Love.
Delphine. "
