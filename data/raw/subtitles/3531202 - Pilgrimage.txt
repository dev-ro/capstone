It's been a long time
since we have had visitors,
Brother Geraldus...
especially one
who has traveled as far as you.
The authority of Rome knows
no distance, Father Abbot...
...not even to the ends
of the earth.
This cannot be.
We received no word.
My apologies.
Our Holy Father,
alas, has many enemies.
Discretion
was of the utmost importance,
second only to haste.
You do not know what you ask.
Father Abbot, Rome has spoken.
There is no debate.
These are dark days
for the faithful.
Jerusalem has been lost
for 20 years now.
Infidels surround us
on every side, on every shore,
while heretics
conspire within our midst.
Our Holy Father believes
the relic you keep here
has the power to separate
the faithful from the faithless,
to summon the wrath of God
upon his enemies...
a power that could ensure a
victory in the upcoming Crusade.
You cannot hide such a power.
You will see the safe delivery
of our holiest relic to Rome.
Go with God.
There's not a mark on it.
Aah!
They're afraid of it.
Even before the lightning,
they would not go near it.
Of course they were.
They know what happens
to those who disturb the relic.
Perhaps you are unfamiliar
with the stories, Brother,
or else you would not be
so eager to remove it.
Enlighten me.
Before we had such
a fine gold box to keep it in,
other foreigners
tried to take it... Norsemen.
They brought a bloody tide
to these shores for 200 years
before they came to Kilmannán.
The monks were sleeping.
The lucky ones
would have died in their beds,
but they were woken
by a strange sound.
They ran out to the church
and saw an angel
striking the relic
as if it were a bell.
The monks fled.
When they returned, they saw
that a great storm had blown up.
Every single Norse ship
had been dragged
to the bottom of the sea,
where their souls
would know no rest.
Just beside the relic were
the bodies of three Norsemen,
twisted and burnt.
No one but the pure of heart
can touch the relic and live.
No one.
How long has he served you?
He's been with us five summers.
He is not a monk.
He respects what we carry,
but he does not fear it.
But he is just a mute.
A half-wit.
He is not a half-wit.
Diarmuid found him washed up
on our shores...
in a curragh with no oars,
no food.
In some lands,
that is a punishment.
Perhaps he's atoning.
He has obeyed every task
asked of him,
no matter how difficult
or dangerous.
In all that time,
he has never spoken.
It is not our place to ask why.
We should sleep.
I did not know you spoke
my tongue, Brother Ciaran.
The abbot
said you were far-traveled.
You have seen Rome?
A long time ago.
And the Holy Land?
Jerusalem?
Hey, hey!
Hey!
He says that water is no good.
It runs through there.
What of it?
Place of the sídhe.
They say the Tuatha Dé Danann
come out at night
to play among those rocks.
They cast spells into the water
and bewitch travelers.
You're afraid of this?
You allow your course
to be determined
by pagan superstition?
Geraldus,
we should not tarry here.
We are soldiers of Christ,
yet you would run
from a mere skirmish.
In the name of St. Matthias,
whose relic we are honored
to bring to the feet
of the Holy See,
I bless and purify this water.
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
I scatter the demons
that have tainted it,
consign them
to everlasting hell,
where they shall be bound
in fiery chains
and crushed under the heel
of God Almighty.
Boy.
What is that, boy?
It helps ward off...
It soothes an aching stomach,
Brother.
Will you try some?
I have no stomachache,
herbalist.
We go.
You were to take us
to De Merville's border.
Brothers.
Geraldus.
All I ask is for a little faith.
Is that so hard?
I imagine when you joined
the monastery...
...they did not tell
you would be a pack mule.
He's not a monk, my lord.
He's a converso, a lay brother.
Some of my men
think that they know you,
but not from where.
What Crusade was it?
Venice?
Constantinople?
Perhaps you might settle
the matter.
There is a small wager on it.
He is a mute.
He cannot speak.
Bit his tongue, did he?
Deaf, also?
He can hear you.
But chooses not to.
A pretty box.
It is but a humble shell.
Brother Ciaran.
This is unwise.
After Judas betrayed Christ,
the apostles cast lots
to replace him,
and Matthias from Bethlehem
was chosen.
Following the death
and resurrection of our Lord,
Matthias traveled north
to spread the gospel
to the barbarians of Cappadocia.
There, he was martyred.
And the stones of the pagans
broke his bones
and spilled his blood.
Matthias gave thanks.
The rock that ended
his earthly life caught fire
and burned
the men who murdered him.
They cried out for mercy,
but the ground opened up,
and hell swallowed them whole,
while the body of Matthias
was elevated to heaven.
And this is that rock.
Most impressive.
If you talk of having some kind
of agreement with these men,
I would like
to know the particulars.
They do not concern you.
As regards
the sanctity of the relic
and the lives of my brothers,
they very much concern me.
You are not blind as
to what kind of men these are.
Yet you entrust all
to their protection.
You were on Crusade, Brother.
It cannot be so hard
for you to guess.
On the day of judgment,
the worst of men
will have the greatest of fear,
unless someone can intercede
on their behalf.
You mean to absolve them?
A powerful man does not become
so without incurring sin.
The baron is not a young man.
His mind has inevitably turned
to more spiritual matters.
We are their only salvation.
The blackest of their deeds
bind them to us.
No.
No.
Not to us.
Brother...
...Rua says the foreigners
know nothing but war.
He says it's in their blood...
...that they're descended
from the Norsemen...
...and they conquered
France and England
and will do the same here.
But was there ever truly peace
in this land, Brother,
before the foreigners came?
That was a long time ago,
Diarmuid.
I was just a boy,
little older than you.
No.
No, there was never peace.
Not here.
Not anywhere else in this world.
Not since the fall.
Why?
Some say it's not
the natural way of things.
Peace needs to be grown,
cared for, nurtured.
And that...
...that is beyond the reach
of most men.
You're up early, little monk.
I always rise at this time.
Or perhaps you are a spy.
My lord?
Sneaking away to tell your
kinsmen about our route south.
- Is that it?
- No, no, my lord.
No?
Then why do you flee?
I serve Christ.
But you serve your clan first,
no?
No.
My father is always impressed
with pious men.
Me?
I have my doubts.
Anyone can wear
the robes of a monk.
You.
Does something ail you, Brother?
No.
It's nothing.
Hyah! Hyah!
Aah!
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!
Stop! Aah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hey, hey!
Uhh!
Where's the rock?!
Where is it?
Where's the rock?
We must retrieve it.
Did you not hear the bell?
Did you not witness the miracle?
When those savages defiled
the rock of St. Matthias,
look how God wrought
an instrument of vengeance
from the lowliest
of his servants.
You are in the service
of the Church, are you not?
He who smote many nations
and slew many kings...
...go forth
with an untroubled heart.
These are enemies of Christ,
and he rejoices
with every one you destroy.
Your work is not yet done.
Such is true for all of us.
What would you have us do?
Our escorts are dead.
Our brothers are slaughtered.
We don't even know
where they are.
A cart.
A prisoner.
They will have left tracks,
will they not?
The young Lord De Merville
said he would return.
He has men, knights.
We could wait for him.
And if the others return first?
It is our duty to try.
- There's so many.
- We could make a diversion,
- draw them away.
- How far would we get
with the reliquary on our backs?
We do not need the reliquary.
Only what's inside it.
I will carry it.
I will carry the relic.
One of you
will have to free Ciaran.
No.
We cannot risk
the recovery of the relic.
- Not for one man.
- How can you say such a thing?
Because this was
the oath we took.
These bodies,
they're not our own.
They're the Lord's
to do with as he sees fit.
Were Brother Ciaran here
instead of I,
he would tell you
the same thing.
Even if he's alive,
how long
before they noticed he was gone?
We cannot leave him.
We shall pray for his soul.
What is he doing?
Brother Ciaran.
Diarmuid?
Diarmuid.
- Diarmuid.
- Shh. Brother, please.
Please be quiet.
You have to save your strength
for when we run, please.
No. Wait, wait.
Wait.
Diarmuid, listen to me.
You must go.
You must leave... now.
No, no.
I cannot leave.
Not without the rock.
Not without you.
I hope the Lord will forgive me,
but I threw it from the cart.
What?
Where?
A clearing of plúrín sneachta.
The last place
I saw you following.
You'll find it
near the cart track.
Take it and go east.
Keep it safe.
Keep yourself safe, Diarmuid.
Go. Go.
Where is the rock, Brother?
You vowed to protect us...
...and it.
I vowed to honor
and obey my king.
Your pope
is quarreling with him.
A relic such as yours would be
a powerful bargaining tool.
Presumably,
you will be well rewarded.
The king is not happy
with how powerful
some of his subjects here
have become.
He thinks they are
still too friendly
with their cousins in Normandy.
A wise man would do well
to prove his loyalty.
And in doing so,
you would betray
your own father's chance
at salvation?
My father is a coward.
Dying, he would rather grovel
to the Church
than safeguard the future
of his family.
Where is the relic?
Brother, sooner or later,
it will make its way to Rome.
What difference if it spent
a year or so with the king?
I do not know where it is.
You're lying...
...badly.
I expected better
from a man of the cloth.
I got this from a priest
in Constantinople.
A strange man.
We used it to, uh, persuade
the Greeks
to tell us where they had hidden
all of the gold
from their churches.
I never saw it fail.
Your last chance.
Where?!
Do you feel that?
Those are your entrails...
twisted around the arrow,
like worms on a hook.
Would you like to see them?
You have suffered enough,
Brother.
I can give you a quick death.
A merciful death.
Just tell me.
Where is the relic?
You will die an agonizing death.
And for what?
Even if we don't find the relic,
another stone will do.
Put anything in a pretty box,
and people will accept it...
even a king or a pope.
Think on that.
Here.
- Is it?
- That's it.
You disobeyed me.
I wasn't going to leave
Ciaran there.
Do you have any idea of
the responsibility placed on me?
Our purpose is ordained
by God's office on earth.
It cannot be jeopardized
by anything or anyone.
Your duty is to obey.
Brother, there is a great war
being fought all around us.
Our enemy is the devil himself,
and in this war,
he waits a lifetime,
an eternity for a single moment
of weakness...
...such as yours.
Do not give into him again.
Brother.
They will kill us.
We're all alone.
They have knights and horses.
- They will find our tracks.
- Cathal.
And they will kill us.
We are not alone.
We are never alone.
Have faith.
Praise be.
God has heard us.
How far
do you think you can get?!
20 paces at most?!
Or do you think
you can walk on water?!
It doesn't have to be this way.
Just give me the rock,
and I will let you live.
I gave the same choice
to one of your brother monks.
But, alas, he was unreasonable.
It shouldn't be
a difficult decision.
Like your father.
Did you tell your fellow monks
the reason that the Church
trusted
Geraldus Trencavel d'Albi
with such an important task?
How you denounced him
as an heretic?
And when he refused to repent,
you, his only son,
sent him first to the wheel
and then to the stake.
After his lands
went to the Church,
your future in Rome was secure.
Where now?
Tell them they will be paid
once we reach the port.
Tell them.
- Why do you laugh?!
- Geraldus!
We are men of God!
Doesn't that mean anything
in this accursed country?!
Keep your voice down.
We... We could...
We could force him.
We could.
- No. He will not.
- Our need is great.
He will not, Brother.
You disobey me again?
You are not worthy
to carry that relic.
There is something in you, boy.
- Something evil.
- Wait.
Was there truth in what he said?
About your father.
He sheltered heretics,
helped them escape trial.
I served the Church
to the best of my ability.
My conscious is clear.
What else
do you wish to know, boy?
Nothing.
I asked him to repent,
but he did not.
Right to the end,
he refused to believe
that he had done any wrong.
I learned something
very important that day.
It wasn't his faith
in the Church that he lost.
It was his fear of it.
What are you saying?
Go with God!
Aah!
Cathal!
Hell.
Do you hear them?
Do you hear the bells?
The bell will inspire
an army of men like him.
Men who will protect Jerusalem.
Men who will protect the world.
The heretics, the infidels,
the faithless...
If they will not hear the truth,
they will suffer.
All doubt will be swept away.
Stand with the Church and live,
or stand against it
and be crushed.
What are you doing?
No!
It is God's own.
- I'm giving it back to him!
- No.
The devil has you, boy.
Aah! Aah!
