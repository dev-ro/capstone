THE OTHER SON
Ever had surgery?
No.
Allergies?
No.
You smoke?
No.
Hashish?
No.
How often?
Jump onto the scales.
Tell me the truth, Joseph.
Now and again.
What's "now and again"?
Every day? Once a week?
Yeah, once a week or so.
I'd rather my parents didn't know.
Well?
63 kilos.
An Arab enters a restaurant.
What do you look at first?
His eyes?
His waist?
Didn't your father teach you this?
So how did you do at school?
Not bad.
You listened to your teacher?
Well, yes.
If you didn't agree with something,
what did you do?
You can't always agree,
but he was my teacher.
Why join this elite unit?
I like the air force.
- Parachuting interests me.
- And after your military service?
I want to sing.
My regards to your father.
Did they give you the date?
2 September.
So you've got time.
You been dragged through a hedge?
- Don't I look good?
- Great, yes.
Enjoy it before they scalp you.
Jo!
Have fun!
Stop, Ilan!
I won't see you again for 3 years.
Something to remember me by.
We're old friends!
It's like doing it with my brother.
You hear about the drownings?
One was a swimming instructor.
Why be a swimming instructor
if you're going to drown'?
But those currents...
Any good ideas for making some money
before September?
Sell ice creams.
Sell your songs.
Sell your body!
Just a second, honey.
They made a mistake
in your blood tests.
What?
They say you're A+.
So?
You can't be.
Your father and I are A-.
It's the law of genetics.
I called them.
Blood test tomorrow at 10.
Another?
Goodbye, Lisa.
See you next week.
What's wrong with her?
Joseph, you know I won't say.
It's OK, I don't know her.
Something wrong? Am I ill?
No, everything's fine.
David wants to see you.
Are you going home?
See you later.
I'll be back in 5 minutes.
Hi.
My name's Joseph.
When I'm down,
I listen to a really sad song.
I have a good cry, then I feel better.
There's no error with you, Orith.
You're A-.
Joseph is A+.
It isn't possible!
Or Alon isn't A-.
It's the only explanation.
He had a gallstone out last year.
I asked for his file.
He's A-.
A DNA test would sort it out.
But you'd have to tell Alon.
- Shall I keep on looking...?
- Of course!
Sorry, David, but I'm baffled.
You look beautiful.
You OK?
Sorry, work's been crazy.
Really?
A busy day.
Now I get my reward!
Supposing it's a special case?
An exception?
It's impossible.
There are no genetic exceptions.
Why didn't you tell me
before Joseph had the second test?
I'll do it, honey, it's hot.
It's kind of overcooked,
but Joseph wouldn't help me.
I made the salad!
You made the salad?
You're making progress!
What did you go see?
You go to the movies on Tuesday
because it's Tuesday.
Routine can be nice.
Tuesday comes, I know your dad and I
can escape together for a while.
It delights me.
But you don't know
what you've seen.
It's disgusting, Keren.
I hate you, creep!
Can we all calm down?
Why?
Because I need some
peace and quiet.
Bon bon appétit.
- Shame you don't treat Mike Brandt.
- Mike Brandt?
I was a little girl when he died.
Never heard of him.
A singer who died ages ago.
Ever saved anyone's life?
Yes, it's happened.
I had a patient with
strong suicidal tendencies.
You stopped him killing himself?
It wasn't easy, but yes.
We got to know each other well.
What became of him?
No idea.
But I check every year
that he's still alive.
You never mentioned that guy.
What guy?
The suicidal type.
I seldom talk about my patients.
This one sounds important.
To ask after him every year...
I just do it to make sure
the treatment has been successful.
What of it?
You think I had another man
18 years ago, right?
I don't like having to tell you,
but since you ask...
No, Alon, I've never been unfaithful.
No, I...
I didn't ask if you had.
But you really wanted
to know the answer.
I carried on my research,
as requested.
I thought...
Why don't you sit down?
Did you ever wonder
why Joseph doesn't look like
his father?
You think he looks like me?
David, I'll say it to you too
since it's what everyone's thinking.
No, I wasn't unfaithful to Alon.
Joseph isn't like anyone.
Joseph is Joseph.
That's just it.
Sit down, please.
You gave birth at Haifa?
We were living there. Why?
At Rothschild, 23 January 1991.
Yes. So?
On Tuesday, I had a hunch.
I'm awaiting confirmation--
What hunch?
- I'd rather--
- What hunch?
Stay calm, Orith.
I am.
What hunch?
That maybe Joseph
isn't your son either.
Orith!
Don't just leave.
Where are you going?
I don't know. For a walk.
I'll come with you.
No! I want to be alone.
Have you had pain anywhere
this week?
Here?
Does it hurt here?
There's a lump.
It doesn't hurt here?
Here?
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all day.
What's going on?
Tell me.
David called Rothschild Hospital
in Haifa.
Remember the night I gave birth?
When they took Joseph away,
I thought he'd be safe if a Scud hit.
I didn't know...
there was another baby
in the incubator.
The next day, when they brought me
my baby, it wasn't my baby...
It was the other one.
What are you saying?
You'd have noticed
if it was another baby.
Any mother would.
Apparently not.
Oh no? Did your vegetarian doctor pal
tell you this bullshit?
Please, you weren't there.
I'm a soldier! It was the Gulf War!
I meant you weren't there to hear
what David told me today.
We have an appointment
at Rothschild in 2 weeks.
We have to do a DNA test
before then.
I'm not going to Rothschild.
It's all bullshit.
It doesn't make sense.
Alon, we're going.
Mr and Mrs Silberg?
Sorry for the wait.
Please...
Mr and Mrs Al-Bezaaz?
How do you do.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Let me do the introductions.
Mr and Mrs Silberg.
Mr and Mrs Al-Bezaaz.
Please...
Mr and Mrs Al-Bezaaz,
may I speak in Hebrew?
Out of the question!
Joseph is a Silberg.
That's all.
No. Defence.
But it'll be seen to quickly.
I can't take this.
I speak a little French.
For Yacine.
He's over there.
Yes, sweetheart.
Go ahead, my son.
Congratulations, darling!
I'll tell your father.
Yes, darling, I'll call later.
Saïd!
It was Yacine.
He passed his baccalauréat.
He got his diploma!
Saïd...
How will we tell him?
We won't.
Imagine if my sister found out.
Or our friends. Neighbours.
Forget everything we've heard.
Forget?
You who complain that they forget
how they threw us off our land.
You want to forget? Impossible!
This is totally different.
My son! At last!
- We missed you.
- Me too.
Hi, little brother.
Welcome home.
Thanks.
Why carry it?
It's got wheels.
You've become a lazy European!
Come on, hurry up!
As you see,
our villages are still imprisoned
and our lands cut in two.
A curse on those who stole from us!
Bilal, settle down.
Tell me...
Yacine, look at Ma.
Tell me...
How is the world's
most beautiful city?
Paris is still Paris.
- Really?
- I'll tell you all about it.
Yacine got his baccalauréat!
Congratulations!
Thank you.
Dad.
Dad!
Hi, Yacine.
I'll be right with you.
I'll just finish up.
Cars come first,
then family.
Come on, son, he'll join us later.
Amina! How are you, my lovely?
- How are you?
- Well. I missed you!
One for you, one for me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet B-B, Bezaaz, the Brazilian.
Thanks, brother.
No, honey, no.
That's for the loveliest.
Me?
No. The loveliest, I said.
Ma!
For me?
You look beautiful.
Thank you, darling.
And who's this for?
I don't know.
See for yourself.
She's lovely!
What's her name?
Her name is...
Sophie Marceau.
Dad, look!
Yacine brought me Sophie Marceau!
Sophie who? She's pretty.
So, you're done?
You can operate,
give me a new knee?
I haven't even started medical school.
You'll have to wait 8 years
before I can operate on you.
You should see someone else.
No, it's you or no one.
How's my sister Fatima? And Omar?
Well.
Here, Dad, while you wait...
Thank you.
Let's...
Let's hope it keeps on
bringing relief.
They didn't tell me.
My son isn't doing his military service and--
Why not?
What's going on?
What will my friends think?
That Dad has pulled strings!
Not my style.
I'm not a string-puller.
It's not that simple.
What's wrong?
Orith!
On 23 January 1991,
Scud missiles hit Haifa.
You know this.
You were taken out
with another newborn baby.
In the panic,
the babies were switched.
I don't understand.
There's nothing to understand.
I don't understand either!
The babies were switched.
So?
So there was a mix-up, Joseph.
The nurse made a mistake.
You mean...
I'm the other one?
And the other one is me?
Will we have to give him back?
We've met his parents.
What are they like?
They're Palestinian.
From the West Bank.
She was just visiting her sister
in Haifa
and it happened.
Sooner than expected.
You were born early.
The same day as Yacine.
Yacine?
You've seen him?
A photo, yes.
Can I see his parents too?
Yacine what?
Al-Bezaaz.
I'll have to swap my kippa
for a suicide bomb.
Don't ever say that!
Am I still Jewish?
- Hi!
- Good to see you!
You look like a Frenchman now!
It is written
that great challenges
are for great men.
God loves men
as a father loves his son.
Orith told me your story, Joseph.
I am sad for you.
Rabbi...
am I still Jewish?
It doesn't alter the fact I'm Jewish,
does it?
If you really want to be,
you can be.
What do you mean, "if I want to be"?
I'm circumcised,
I've had my Bar Mitzvah,
I've studied at the yeshiva,
celebrated festivals...
I've always lived this way.
It's a three-step conversion.
Circumcision.
That's already done.
Acceptation of the Torah.
That should be easy in your case.
And...
immersion in a ritual bath,
with 3 rabbis.
But rabbi...
you said that I was
one of your best students.
Judaism is not a belief, Joseph.
It is a state.
A spiritual state of being,
tied to our own nature.
Your real mother isn't Jewish,
so neither are you.
Not yet.
I'm exactly as I was before.
God will help you in this conversion.
What about the one
I was swapped with?
He is Jewish.
By his mother. By nature.
You mean...
he's more Jewish than I am?
That's the way it is.
That's the way it is.
He's Arab!
Arab!
Ma!
Ma!
Phone's for you.
Hello?
May I speak French?
Yes.
Have you spoken to Yacine?
No.
I don't know how to deal
with his father.
Tell him it's nobody's fault,
it's just the way it is.
It's mektoub!
It's their life,
they have a right to know.
Talk to your husband.
He has to understand.
See you soon, Leïla.
May God help you.
May God help us all.
I told the officer,
"Don't you realise?
I'll be dragging my inhaler around.
There's no point!"
He still made me enlist.
He won't declare you unfit
just 'cause you've got asthma.
I'd have testified to "mental illness".
If my dad had been a colonel,
I'd have had it easy.
So you'd be a wanker and stay at home
while your friends defended the country?
My service starts in 6 months
and I'm proud!
Good for you.
I'd get strings pulled if I could.
Guys killing each other on TV
is one thing
but when it's you doing it,
it stays with you forever.
Your dad did the right thing, Jo.
You're lucky.
Did you find a way
to make some money?
- Yes.
- How?
Ice creams...
I'm selling ice creams.
I'll get going.
What?
Is it my fault?
No...
Not really.
How much?
5 euros.
Around 30 shekels.
The box?
One cigar.
You get the girls with it?
No, cigars are for old fellas!
What did she want?
Who?
What did she want?
I know it was her!
It's hard for her family.
They want to meet Yacine.
No!
No!
We've discussed this!
You've discussed it!
And decided we won't tell him!
But it's Yacine's life, not yours!
He'll find out sooner or later!
- What's going on?
- "Find out" what?
Who's the woman who called?
Why does her family want
to meet me?
Are you marrying him off?
Ma?
Yacine...
If you want to meet them,
Orith has invited us to her place.
In Tel Aviv.
So, it's you.
Come and see, guys!
Frankly, it shows, doesn't it?
Did you check the papers?
Everything in order?
Let them through.
Go!
Alon, can you help me, please?
If that's all you're going to do...
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't do anything, then!
See?
Saïd...
Let's go.
Hello.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Are you my new brother?
Are you French?
No, we're Israeli.
Ma's French, Dad's parents too.
We usually speak French at home.
Honey, what are you doing?
Sophie Marceau's sister!
I'll show you my room.
You got your baccalauréat?
Yes.
He passed with honours!
You'll carry on with your studies?
I start medical school in September.
Where do you live in Paris?
Belleville, at my aunt's.
You know it?
Yes.
And you, habibi?
What are you going to do?
Be a musician.
Really?
His father's delighted.
Said... Joseph is a musician.
He gets it from you.
Here, he was 7.
At my brother's wedding.
He wanted to sing
in front of 300 people.
I don't believe it!
Saïd.
He's the spitting image of Firaz.
He's just like him!
Not Bilal, though.
Bilal is his elder brother.
He's sorry, he couldn't come.
Firaz, his younger brother, is dead.
Dad, can we smoke outside?
How did you feel when you heard?
Same as you, I imagine.
I'm trying to make sense of it all.
So I don't go under.
Does Bilal know?
He knows he has a brother
and it isn't me.
Is that why he didn't come?
He doesn't want to come?
Does he hate us?
How's it feel to be Palestinian?
Do you feel hatred?
No, really, I don't.
You never hated?
No. You?
I live in Paris, a long way away.
Got a girlfriend?
No.
You?
It comes, it goes, it never shows.
An artist, not a soldier.
Thankfully he won't do
his military service.
Why "thankfully"?
Because he's Arab?
It's the truth.
Alon, enough!
I'm sorry.
Shut up!
Well?
Had fun with the occupying forces?
I'm going to Gran's.
Gran's? What for?
To sleep.
Can't you sleep here?
And you don't say a word!
Joseph?
You followed me?
Sorry, not now!
We'll sing a sad song,
we'll cry, you'll feel better.
I've done it, it works.
I just want to be alone,
you know?
I just wanted to cheer you up.
Yeah? Go ahead!
Sorry.
Sorry...
Why not go live on the other side?
Isn't that where your home is now?
Answer me!
You've always been a Jew.
Just go! Leave now!
I'll be whatever and whoever I like.
You're the others' son!
Sooner or later you'll go live there.
Where you should have grown up.
Bilal.
I know what you're afraid of.
For me, nothing has changed.
Especially not our dream.
In 8 years,
I'll come back to Palestine.
We'll build that hospital.
Why would you?
For Firaz,
who was never your brother?
You'll forget him.
And me, I'm not your brother either.
They say...
that Indian babies smell of curry.
If you'd still smoked,
would yours have smelled of nicotine?
Apparently you get tiny babies.
What about your baby?
The one you didn't get the chance to kiss.
Don't you want to kiss him?
Yes!
Everything OK?
Fine.
Tea?
Thanks.
Everything's so expensive.
Tomatoes cost as much as rubies.
Bilal, you hear that?
Get the phone.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Yacine!
Yacine!
It's for you.
Hello?
Joseph?
Bilal!
What?
I don't know. Maybe.
Don't you want to change your name?
Better learn some Hebrew, man.
Here's Bilal.
You came alone?
Where's Yacine?
- I don't know, I'm not his mother!
Hi, guys.
Three shekels a can. A bargain!
Take it back.
With all that smoke...
aren't you thirsty?
I'm broke.
Do like Salim, work in Ashdod.
Work for Jews?
I'll go when it's Palestine again!
Might take a while.
Bilal! Tell him to get lost.
Why are you mad?
You have to work and make a living.
I won't drop my pants for Jews.
Might get screwed.
Here.
OK, Jamil.
Get out of here.
Go on! Get lost!
Ice creams!
You have to give them a smile.
Look at people too.
I'll finish and be right with you.
Why?
I'll sell some too.
No!
How do you say it?
I'll show you.
See?
Not bad.
You're good.
Better than I've been all day.
All these people lying round
roasting themselves.
All that skin cancer
will keep you busy.
Here, your share.
No, no.
You worked too.
Take it,
or you'll say we exploit you.
Thanks.
I've got cousins at Ramallah
who might never see the sea again
because they've got no pass.
It kills me.
At school I told them
I had a new brother.
Oh?
What did you say?
Did you tell them his name?
No, I said he was handsome
with long lashes
and had been to see us once.
My girlfriends don't care.
They say brothers stink.
It's true. Joseph is never here.
My mother wants you to come
to our house.
See you around.
Yes?
Did I wake you up?
No.
I wasn't asleep.
Well?
Well what?
Did you see him?
I told him you wanted to see him.
Is that why you're still awake?
No.
If LeTla hadn't gone to Haifa,
I'd be the one living over there.
To you...
and to Dad...
I'd be a complete stranger.
Your father and I have loved you
every second of your life.
And although I worry about Yacine
and can't help thinking of him
as my third child...
you'll always be mine.
Yes?
Colonel!
An Arab wanted to see you.
Yes?
We couldn't let him in.
The civil authorities
had issued him with a pass. And...
as he hadn't asked for anything,
he figured it came from here.
He wanted to thank you.
Where is he?
No idea. He's probably gone.
Coffee?
Good morning.
Morning, sweetheart.
Here, Ma.
How did you get this?
I sold ice creams on the beach.
Don't tell Bilal it came from there.
Remember when you were little?
When I gave you cake,
you'd save half for Yacine.
You'd wait for him to come home
for the holidays.
When he came back,
his cake would be dry and mouldy.
"Half for him, half for me",
you'd say.
Do you remember?
He's one of them.
Bilal...
Yacine is still your brother.
Firaz was my brother. And he's dead.
Open your heart, my son.
I know it's a big one.
Ice creams!
How did you get past
the checkpoint?
I got a one-month pass.
Didn't your dad tell you?
I can apply for
an Israeli passport, actually.
You might be the one
who needs a pass.
- Have you come to piss me off?
- No, to sell ice creams.
Ice creams!
Have you got pistachio flavour?
Yes.
How much?
14 shekels.
1O shekels because you're beautiful.
Thank you.
No luck!
It happens.
Ice creams!
- Shit.
- What?
- My friends.
- You'll have to introduce me.
Don't mess around.
Hey, Joseph!
Giving us the cold shoulder?
My cousin from Paris. Daniel.
He only speaks French and English.
Daniel, I explained
that you're my cousin from Paris,
and you only speak English
and French.
OK.
Is Paris not cool anymore?
What's with the clothes?
He's doesn't care about fashion.
He's studying medicine.
Coming to the Albatross tonight?
It's Gad's birthday.
You speak French?
Yeah, why not?
Shall we go to the Albatross?
Yeah.
Well, I'll get back to work.
Has he got a girl in Paris?
What?
Say yes or she'll jump on him!
Stop it, Ilan!
Bye.
Cousin my eye.
Who is he, then?
I don't know.
His boyfriend?
What? You're crazy!
So why is he lying?
That's a month's salary for my dad.
I told you he's an engineer?
I thought he was a mechanic.
No, he's an engineer.
Only he's not allowed to work
outside his village.
I might have been a jerk like you,
obsessed with clubs and clothes.
Thanks to this jerk,
you won't look like a hick in front of Yona.
Her name's Yona?
- You're not in love with her...
- No.
There's a girl I liked,
but I screwed up, so it's over.
Yona's free.
Look.
Isaac and Ishmael.
Abraham's two children.
Hi, Yacine.
We're late, come on.
Where are you going?
A friend's party.
You don't know him.
I'm my worst enemy,
but I must love myself anyway.
- Don't you ever think that?
- Yes.
Even as I'm smoking a big joint
with my worst enemy.
So pass it on.
Being Jewish was important.
It meant something.
Now it's as if I didn't exist.
I can't feel Jewish anymore.
I don't feel Arab either.
What's left?
There's Aborigine, or Tutsi.
Given a choice,
what would you have been?
James Bond.
My dad would have loved me
to be like you.
Your dad sees you.
Only you.
Where are you going?
Joseph! Ma!
Joseph... Never mind the rabbi,
we're here for your grandma.
I can mourn her anywhere.
She isn't even my grandma.
Joseph!
Don't make trouble. Not here.
Is that all you can say?
He's right.
You're right, Dad... No trouble.
Hello.
Why do you want to go there?
Where is this?
Thanks.
Al-Bezaaz?
Saïd and Leïla Al-Bezaaz?
Are you OK?
Yes.
Come in.
Do you know him?
We know him.
- He's family?
- Yes.
A cousin from Paris.
Ah, Paris, lovely, lovely!
You should know, you're from here,
your blood is Muslim.
Say, "My name is Youssef."
"I am an Arab from Palestine."
"I am an Arab"?
From Palestine.
What does he want?
He came to see us.
It's only natural.
Be nice.
Everyone will know!
We already told them
he's our sister's boy.
Where's Yacine?
There.
Where's there?
Tel Aviv.
Sit down.
Bilal, time for dinner!
What's all this today?
Stop asking questions. Sit down.
Your plate.
That's enough, thanks.
Want some?
Very nice.
Thank you.
Joseph, did you tell your parents?
Orith?
It's me, Leïla.
Joseph is with us.
I mean,
he found the house by himself.
Inch 'Allah.
Come.
I'm sorry.
You're my son.
You always will be,
whatever happens.
I love you, Dad.
That's Bilal, my...
The elder brother.
Bilal.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You know, Dad, we sang together.
Really?
That's great.
Great.
That's twice in two weeks
you've requested paperwork.
Affirmative.
Bilal Al-Bezaaz.
Al-Bezaaz...
Do we have protégés, Colonel?
I forgot.
You have family over there now.
Did I tell you to sit down, Sergeant?
No, sir.
Damn! They're loaded round here!
Shall we go?
See you at the beach, OK?
Cigarette?
Yes.
Joseph! Joseph!
Joseph, stay with me! Joseph!
Stay with me.
Stay with me, stay with me!
What's your name?
What's your name?
Yacine... Yacine...
Thanks.
If I'd died, would I have been buried
as a Jew or an Arab?
Praise the Lord!
You OK?
Better.
I called your parents.
They're coming.
My Parents?
Which ones?
You know what I thought when I learnt
that my life should have been yours?
I thought,
"Now I've started this life,
"I have to make a success of it
so you'll be proud of me.
"Same goes for you.
You have my life, Joseph.
Don't mess it up."
