MAN:
Officer on deck.
Today, you're going to locate
a medium-sized Bug colony
and wipe it out.
Intel estimates infestation
is level two.
Which means we're up against
1000 active defenders.
We know what to do.
Kill them all.
Ooh.
Yeah, that's the idea.
Run the plan,
lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
Uh...
Geo.
First team secures
the landing zone, sir.
Uh, Camacho.
We'll locate the target
colony's entrance, sir?
Uh, One-Oh-One?
We give them the gas.
Kills Bugs, but don't hurt us.
Baba.
[LAUGHS]
Oh, geez, that's me.
Flip the nuke,
flip the launcher on the nuke.
Ugh.
Oh, uh, but not yet.
Uh...Dutch.
Me and Bessie seal the deal,
right down their Bug hole.
MAN [OVER INTERCOM]:
Eagle One ready for takeoff.
Remember your training,
and stick to the plan.
Do you get me?
TEAM [OVERLAPPING]:
Yes, sir. We get you, sir.
Lock and load.
Yeah.
Let's do this.
All right, baby.
[♪♪♪]
MAN 1:
Eagle One, clear.
MAN 2:
Eagle Two, clear.
MAN 3:
Eagle Three, clear.
MAN 1:
Eagle One, touchdown in 10,
 nine, eight,
 seven, six, five,
 four, three, two, one.
[GROANS]
[LOUD CRASH]
[HEAVY BREATHING]
[SQUEALS]
Geo, no!
No, no. God, no. No, no!
[ROARS]
Bug!
[SQUEALS]
[GUNFIRE]
Come on, you apes.
Move out. Move it. Let's go!
[ROARS]
Goddamn.
They don't quit.
What's your malfunction,
lieutenant?
Come on.
Go get them!
[GUNFIRE]
Form a perimeter!
Holy shit.
BABA:
Oh, man.
[SHRIEKS]
No time for praying, son.
I got your back.
Fire in the hole.
[BUGS SCREAM]
CAMACHO [LAUGHS]:
Nice one.
Camacho, 9 o'clock.
[ALL SCREAM]
Help me! Help me!
Camacho.
Colonel Rico!
Pull back. Stay close.
Oh, man.
We're surrounded again.
Here goes the gas.
[GRUNTS]
Oh, shit!
[YELLING]
Let the gas settle in.
Step back.
[GROANS]
[WHIMPERS]
Colonel Rico?
Rico, where are you?
Ow!
Who was that?
Whoa! I can't see anything.
Lieutenant,
use your infrared.
And keep
your head down.
Oh, right.
Um, okay, my infrared.
Infrared, infrared...
Oh, there you are.
That's not your infrared,
lieutenant.
Oh. Then what is it?
[ALARM BUZZES]
Well, that was just
outstanding.
Well, sir...
how come I always
get ripped in half?
Bugs got your number,
big man.
Colonel, no one told us
it was a trap.
That's not fair, sir.
Here's a little combat secret
for you, lieutenant:
War isn't fair.
It's always a trap.
Cancel your plans,
troopers.
We go again tomorrow.
Sorry, sir,
but don't you remember?
Tomorrow's Air Day.
Celebrating 25 years
of filtered Martian air.
Air Day?
Yes, sir.
We take our terraforming
very seriously.
No one appreciates
a nice gulp of fresh air
like a Martian, sir.
There are no Martians
in my Mobile Infantry,
lieutenant.
Only troopers who follow orders.
Do you get me?
ALL:
We get you, sir.
Same time tomorrow,
troopers.
Dismissed.
[ALL GROAN, MUTTER INDISTINCTLY]
What the hell
was that about?
[SIGHS]
So how about those new
Martian recruits?
If you've been watching,
you know.
Is there anyone
who isn't watching?
It's the wackiest shit
we've ever seen on FedNet.
[LAUGHS]
I call them my Lost Patrol.
I might feed them to the Bugs
and start over.
What do you expect from
a bunch of Martian farm kids?
How is it that I got posted
to the most uneventful colony
in the entire Federation?
Wait.
Don't answer that.
[SIGHS]
They could've made my life
a whole lot worse,
considering I'm the only
commanding officer
ever to let an Arachnid Queen
through our Terran defenses.
Don't be so hard
on yourself, colonel.
If you'd pulled that trigger,
we'd all be dead.
Thanks, Ratzass.
I need to stop
reliving that moment.
Shoot some caffeine?
Check this out.
[LAUGHS]
Colonial duty
isn't for everybody,
but Mars
is a sweet place
to kick back
and get some R&R.
Do I look like someone
who needs R&R?
I'd rather be stuck
on a Bug planet.
At least I'd have
something to shoot.
The Martians prefer
the slow life.
You know if they break away
from the Federation,
they're gonna stop contributing
to the war on Bugs.
Makes no sense.
[LAUGHING]
Nice.
Guys, here it goes:
"There are no Martians
in my Mobile Infantry.
Only troopers
who follow orders."
"And the orders are:
stay in your quarters
and don't have any fun."
[LAUGHTER]
DUTCH:
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
"Real troopers don't celebrate
Air Day.
BOTH:
"Real troopers don't need air."
[ALL LAUGH]
You know, maybe it's true
what they say.
Maybe Martians
just aren't that smart.
That's what people used to say
about me back in high school.
[GASPS]
You idiot.
You idiot.
He totally heard you.
I rest my case.
Martians and their
goddamned air.
That shit is starting
to give me headaches.
Hey, look!
MAN:
Yeah!
I wonder where they're going.
The Fleet's making
a massive strike on the AQZ.
Oh! Yeah!
[♪♪♪]
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
What's the matter, Rico?
Can't stand sitting one out?
I'm Infantry.
We like to fight.
[♪♪♪]
NEWS NARRATOR:
 There's a distinctly different
 air to Air Day this year.
 In addition to the usual
 all-night parties,
 Martian separatists
 are using the holiday
 to promote Martian
 independence.
Recent opinion polls show that
 one in three Martians are tired
 of fighting a war
 that doesn't affect them.
 And a startling 73 percent said
 they'd much rather drink beer.
 Well, it looks like fun
 to be a Martian,
 but fun is for kids.
NEWS NARRATOR:
 At 26, Snapp isn't just
 the Federation's youngest
 sky marshal.
 Federal Scientists now say
 she's probably
 the smartest woman
 who's ever lived.
 In war, you're either
 part of the fight
 or you're part
 of the problem.
INTERVIEWER:
 So do you think independence
 could catch on
 in other emerging
 Federal colonies?
[LAUGHS]
 No.
Mars is a special case where
 ego politics and isolationism
 have conspired against
 moral responsibility.
INTERVIEWER:
 One last question for our
 younger viewers, sky marshal:
 Have you ever been wrong
 about anything?
[LAUGHS]
 It's my curse.
NEWS NARRATOR:
 Would you like to know more?
 In a bold move on the AQZ,
 Sky Marshal Snapp deployed
 the entire Fleet for a surprise
 attack on the Bugs.
 This marks the 20th anniversary
 of the Klendathu invasion.
 Maybe this time, the operation
 will not be a total failure.
 Would you like to know more?
WOMAN [OVER PA]:
 Interstellar flight 103

 now boarding at gate D-51.
Carmen.

Plus one and counting.
It's getting thick

Carmen.
 Carmen, it's Carl.
Carl?
You okay, ma'am?
Keep your eye
on the drop.
Everything I'm about to say
to you is classified.
 So don't talk.
If you can read my thoughts,
then you know I'm a little busy
right now, Carl.
MAN:
--and prepare to evade fire.
You're the only one
who can help right now, Carmen.
 What is it this time?
I need you to get
a message to Johnny.
Johnny's on Mars, right?
You're a lot closer than me.
I can't get through to him
like I can with you.
 You know Johnny.
 He's got a thick head.
Shit. Hold on.
Carl?
MAN:
Plasma. Incoming.
[EXPLOSION]
CARMEN: Maintain altitude.
CARL:
 Okay, I'm back.
So you want me
to abandon my command
in the AQZ
and go to Mars now?
WOMAN [OVER PA]:
 Flight 103 to Geneva
 boarding now.
Now would be good.
Are you going to bother
telling me why?
 No. I think you're better off
 not knowing.
[LOUD CRASH]
[ALL GASP]
Direct hit
on the Ishizuka.
Heavy damage.
Of course not,
because that's the way
you like it.
You haven't changed a bit,
have you, Carl?
 No, and I'm not planning to.
I need you to find Johnny.
Amy Snapp is very upset
with Mars,
and you know
how she can be.
Mobile Infantry,
commence drop.
MAN:
Mobile Infantry, commence drop.
Enjoy the flight, sir.
Thank you.
You're not being
very concrete, Carl.
Yes, I know.
If the truth about Mars
ever comes out,
it will destroy
the Federation.
Is the truth really that bad?
MAN:
Six units standing by
for delivery.
I'm afraid it is.
[WOMAN SCREAMS]

Well, anyway, good luck.
That's it?
"Good luck"?
Yes. We're going
to need it.
Both hands in the air.
[SHRILL BEEP]

He's-- He's in my head!
[ALL GROANING]
So you're in, right?
Where will I find him?
In the Martian Outback.

[BLOWS LAND]
[ALARM BUZZES]

[PANTING]
You know, even Bugs learn

Maybe we need
an easier sim, sir.
Hot LZ 1 is kind of where
it all starts, lieutenant.
Unless you wanna run
baby-Bug petting zoo.
[ALL BREATHING HEAVILY]
Well, I think we could
all use a win.
[LOW RUMBLE]
[ALL GASP]
What's that?
Bug plasma.
What the hell?
Bugs on Mars? Is this the next
training sim, sir?
[RUMBLE]
Negative. This is real world,
trooper.
Get everyone
into battle armor.
Yes, sir.
[♪♪♪]
How bad is it?
There's a major Bug outbreak
on the surface.
Including Plasma Bugs.
Yeah. I kind of
figured that.
RATZASS:
It's been classified as
a level-four infestation.
The Second Mars
Mobile Infantry
is deployed and engaged
on the ground.
Level four?
Do you know what that means?
RATZASS:
We're getting visuals now.
[PEOPLE SCREAMING

We just lost our connection
to the Federation, sir.
We're sitting ducks up here.
Initiate evacuation protocols.
Yes, sir.
[RUMBLE]
Direct plasma hit to flight bay.
I'm taking Lost Patrol
down to the planet.
You're going in with those
Martian kids? Are you crazy?
Someone's gotta knock out
those Bug batteries.
We've trained for it,
so today's the day.
You're a brass-balled trooper
through and through, Rico.
And goddamn it,
I'm going with you.
[♪♪♪]
Hey, Ratzass, come on.
Let's move.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
 Emergency systems activated.
What's your status,
lieutenant?
Uh, power suits on, sir.
Get everyone on the boat now.
This station is gonna blow.
What? Uh, I'm sorry, sir,
c-could you repeat that?
 Code red.
 Evacuation protocol initiated.
Get everyone
on the boat now.
We got Bugs to kill.
Oh, my God.
We're all gonna die.
You do not have
permission to die!
[GRUNTS]
[PANTING]
RICO:
 Someone wanted me here.
 And whoever it was already knew
 there were Bugs on Mars.
Colonel Rico.
Lost Patrol.
Today's the day to prove
yourselves.
We descend to the Mars surface
immediately.
Mars is your home, troopers,
and today she needs your help.
Wipe out every Bug that you see,
and take back your planet.
ALL:
Yes, sir!
[♪♪♪]
Training's over,
troopers.
Sergeant Major Ratzass
is coming along for the ride.
We're dropping
with a legend.
Yeah.
Let's swing.
Come on, you apes.
You wanna live forever?
ALL: Hoo-ah!
To the dropship, now.
On the bounce,

Set your suits
to zero pressure, troopers.

ONE-OH-ONE: One-Oh-One, okay.
CAMACHO: Camacho, okay.
DUTCH: Dutch, okay.

BABA:
Colonel Rico, this looks bad.
Move it, move it.
Let's go.
Move it or lose it.
Let's get out of here.
Yes, sir.
The hangar door
won't open, colonel.
We're a no-go.
We're a no-go
only if I say so.
Everyone onboard?
Uh, yes, sir.
Colonel, no good.
We're stuck.
Maybe this isn't gonna work,

Bullshit.
Link my suit
to your weapons system.
Roger that.
Ready...
fire.
Here we go.
[♪♪♪]
Oh, my God!
Aah!
Remember your training,
troopers, and you will not die.

ALL:
Whoa!
We're going down brown, sir.
Are your people
ready to jump?
We're gonna jump?
This is it, troopers.
We're going HALO
out the rear hatch.
The choice is yours.
Sit here and die,
or make the jump and die.

It's a good day to die.

 Everything is working
 the way it's supposed to.

The bad news is M.I.'s got
a 12-percent casualty drop rate
that's pretty hard to crack.
Five hundred meters to surface.
Retros in three, two, one.
[ALL EXCLAIM]
ONE-OH-ONE:
Bounce back, baby!
Oh, man,
you do that once,
and you wanna do it again.
Just like sex.
Even better.
Oh, yeah.
Not better than sex,

RICO:
Welcome to the Mobile Infantry.
Now, cut the chatter
and get ready
to shit yourselves
all over again.
BABA:
 What are you
 talking about, sir?
RICO:
 Look down, lieutenant.
BABA:
The surface is crawling

Oh, uh...
Kill them all, apes.
Clear a spot to land.
[BUGS SQUEALING]
[GRUNTING AND YELLING]
Form up.
Hold what you got.
Lieutenant,
get over here.
I can't, sir.
Too many of them!
Fine. Just hold your position.
Lieutenant Baba,
do not use the nuke.

 Where are you, colonel?
 I can't see your beacon.
Four o'clock.

Yes, sir.
ONE-OH-ONE:

Hold your positions.

Follow me.
Plasma Bugs.
If we don't kill them
all tonight,
they'll take Mars by morning.
You can get a speeding ticket

but the Federation
misses this?
Yeah, someone with experience
screwed this pooch.
Ready nukes.
Lieutenant, you receiving
my fire coordinates?
Yes, sir.

Prepare to fire.
Sound-off ready.

CAMACHO: I'm hot.

not to mess with Mars.
Fall back, troopers.

Well, I guess
we showed them, huh?
Yeah. And now all their friends
are gonna come looking for us.
When's the rescue boat coming,
sir?
Sometime between
now and never.
Let's move.
I mean, the Fleet, sir.
They gotta be sending the Fleet,
right?
Let's keep moving.
Huh?
Alpha Squad 50-percent
casualty rate.
Delta Squad in full retreat.
This operation's like
slow-motion suicide.
Captain, FedNet has reported
an infestation on Mars.
They've taken

The Special Branch?
What are they doing here?
 Captain Carmen Ibanez,
 you are hereby relieved
 of duty for this operation.
 Relinquish command
 and surrender your vessel.
What's this about?
Under whose orders?
 We don't answer questions
 at Special Branch.
 Failure to comply is treason
 against the Federation.
 Stand down,
 or we will destroy you.
MAN:
Our vessels are the same, ma'am.
Then we're in luck.
 Stay right where you are.

Don't worry.
That beam will never

We're in their blind spot.
Crap design.
Captain, I'm afraid
we're losing speed and falling.
Yes, I know.
Prepare to fire
the main thrusters on my signal.
We're going to swing by
and slingshot straight to Mars.
NEWS NARRATOR:
 Flashes of light from Mars
 tell the tale of a heroic
 last stand
 between a light platoon of
 Mobile Infantry and a Bug army
 of 100,000 Arachnid warriors,
 and then Mars goes dark.
 Federal scientists now believe
 an undetected Bug meteor
 may have impacted the Martian
 Outback three years ago.
 Officials refuse to speculate
 about how many, if any,
 of Mars' human inhabitants
 may have survived
 the Arachnid sneak attack.
 But who should we blame
 for this tragedy?
 Federal psychologists say
 it's most likely Martians.
 They also warn us that those
 oh-so-Martian yearnings
 for personal rights and freedom
 are in reality,
 primitive, childlike behaviors
 that destabilize society
 and weaken the human will
 to survive.
 Would you like to know more?
 [FANFARE PLAYING FAINTLY]
 It's not just about
 our safety.
 It's about duty.
 It's about the future.
 You're right.
 Because the future
 is everyone's duty.
Hmm. That is sharp.
Very sharp.
Daniel?
 Yes, Amy?
Do we have today's numbers?
 Your approval rating
 is at 82.5 percent.
[LAUGHS]
I almost don't believe it.
Almost.
 It is historic.
 No other sky marshal
 has ever been more popular.
Still, there's always room
for improvement.
 The more people hate Martians,
 the more they like you.
 Speaking of which,
 are we moving forward
 with the plan?
You tell me.
Is the Q-bomb ready?
 Yes, but I'm not sure
 if the public is ready.
Oh, they're ready.
They just don't know it yet.
 Shall I prepare
 a statement?
Please.
Something inspirational
this time.
Ah, maybe hit
some family notes.
[BUTTON CLICKS]
AMY [OVER TV]:
 You're right.
 Because the future
 is everyone's duty.
The only thing missing
is a villain.
The traitor of Mars
is still sleeping it off.
He's dreaming about high school.
High school?
Really?
Can you imagine
what Carl Jenkins
was like in high school?
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Wake him up.
[GRUNTS]
[COUGHS]
What is this thing
you have for Bugs, Carl?
Well, to beat your enemy,
you have to know your enemy.
And I learn something new
every day.
And what did you
learn today?
Someone wanted Mars
to get infested.
And that someone's not you?
You were in the perfect position
to mastermind it.
Amy, please.
What are you going to do
to Mars?
I'm going to save them
from themselves.
A Q-bomb?
Really?
Is that your solution?
Come on, Amy.
Is this about the Federation
or your approval ratings?
I've heard enough.
MAN:
Sweet dreams, Carl.
[SIGHS]
You don't need to worry
about my ratings, Carl.
All it takes is a little
fireworks,
and my ratings will soar.
Sit back and enjoy the show,

Think those Bugs are here
for us too, colonel?
Yeah.
They're watching us.
They're afraid we'll nuke them
if they get too close.
RICO:
Just don't tell them
we're out of nukes.
Stupid Bugs ain't gonna
forget about us anytime soon.
Bet they're just
tired of us nuking them
right up their Bug hole.

Forty-five degree--
Okay...
Come back. Come back.

Can anyone tell me
what the fuck
Lieutenant Baba's doing?
He's working up some kind

send out an SOS.
He better not SOS the whole damn

Well, I'll be a Martian's uncle.
 This is Martian National Guard.
 Please identify.

 this is Martian National Guard.
Uh, I think I may have

I may have underestimated you,

Is that you, coz?
Well, hallelujah!
What the heck you doing out here
in the middle of nowhere?
[LAUGHS]
Uh, we've been nuking Bugs,

GEORGE:
 I was out here
 rescuing our men.
 But it appears there
 ain't no one left to rescue.
You mean everyone's dead?
Well, no one's picking up,

Maybe some of them's down
in the mines.
We got damn overrun.

 as we take you live
 to Space Command.
[PATRIOTIC FLOURISH PLAYS]
ANNOUNCER:
 Ladies and gentlemen of
 the United Citizens Federation,
 Sky Marshal Amy Snapp.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE STOPS]
 Fellow citizens,
 we have ourselves
 a problem.
The Arachnid outbreak on Mars is
quickly spinning out of control.
We've lost contact
with her major cities,
 and her defenses are down.
 You may have heard
 that the Federation Fleet
 cannot come to the rescue
 this time,
because they're busy pummeling
 the Bugs in their own backyard.
 But rest assured,
 fellow citizens,
 we have an ace
 in the hole.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the Q-bomb.
 Planted on Mars
 for this very purpose.
 No, not everyone
 is going to like the idea
 of losing a colony
 at the press of a button.
But if you've ever been
to the front lines,
then you know that to win
this war,
you need to play
the long game.
Take a look around.
 At your friends,
 at your loved ones,
 and ask yourself
 one question:
 If we give them Mars,
 then what will they want next?
 I've assembled a task force
 to determine what assets,
 if any,
 can be recovered
 from Mars.
 But we must act quickly,
 before--
[HIGH-PITCHED BEEP]
[GASPS SOFTLY]
Before sensitive targets
are compromised
by Arachnid incursion.
We can't afford to wait,
because...
[GASPS]
...we're not about to let Bugs
pry into our little secrets.
[TONE BEEPS]
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!
Johnny.
Johnny.
Johnny Rico.
Wake up, Johnny.
You can't sleep all day.
Come on, Johnny.
[RICO GROANS SOFTLY]
Okay, fine.

Oh, Johnny.

[MOANS]
What the...?
Are you...
Diz?
[LAUGHS]
I knew that would work.
You died
at Whiskey Outpost.
Wait. Am I dead too?
No, silly.
But the way you sleep,
you might as well be.
Where am I?
Oh, shit.
[GRUNTS]
Mars.
I'm on Mars.
Yup.
Mars needs you.
And I need you
to get rolling.
[RICO PANTING]
Right.
The Bugs.
Exactly.
The Bugs.
[CHUCKLES]
You are such a little genius.
What--?
What about my guys,
The Lost Patrol?
Water.
I need water.
[PANTS AND COUGHS]
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard.
I need water.
[PANTING]
I keep drinking,
but I'm still thirsty.
Drink some more.
Are you a ghost?
No.
So I'm not dead.
Can the dead walk?
No.
Then keep walking.
[PANTING]
Get up, Rico.
I...
What's your malfunction?
Okay.
Are you dying on me?
What?
I said, are you
dying on me, trooper?
No.
No, what?
No, sir.
Then move
your candy ass.
Yes, sir.

[ALARM BEEPING]
GEORGE & BABA:
Whoa!
I don't get it, sir.
Where's the Fleet?
Don't ask me. MarsNet's down.
Everything's down.
[MONITOR BEEPING]
GEORGE: Oh, dang it.
What kind of pilot
blasts off on empty?
I wasn't thinking, coz.
I was scared.
What if the Fleet
isn't coming, sir?
Of course the Fleet's coming.
They have to.
What, they're gonna just
ditch us? And all of Mars too?
We about to ditch Mars
our damn selves.
You think Terran citizens
are gonna care
about a few
stranded Martians?
They'd better at least
pretend to care.
We haven't left
the Federation just yet.
What are you doing, Baba?
I'm trying to get some of
our ass-kicking fight up
on FedBook,
but I can't get connected.
Bug plasma probably fried
the com satellites.
So are you sure
I'm not dead?
Will you stop
asking me that already?
Well, it just...
made sense
that I might be dead.
Made sense?
Not everything makes sense,
Johnny boy.
You're alive and well.
And the Federation's
going to crack
their own colony
with a Q-bomb.
Q-bomb?
You want me
to take care of it?
No. I need you
to take care of it.
Do it for me, Johnny.
Please.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
For you.
Good.
I just don't know where
the hell it is.
Oh, that's the easy part.
It's under
an old terraforming tower.
We're already
halfway there.
Yes, sir.
[CHUCKLES]
DIZ:
Do you remember
high school?
RICO:
I remember football.
And enlistment.
That's about it.
Oh, and that
asshole, Zander.
Heh. Zander.
What a prick.
What about
your friends, Johnny?
Friends?
I don't know.
I had a few.
Not really sure
where they all went.
Well, what about Carl?
Weren't you guys
best friends or something?
Yeah, I guess so.
But that was
a long time ago.
Carl changed.
He's a general now, and it's
almost like he's too big
to be friends with.
I mean,
it's not his fault.
He's busy saving
the whole Federation.
Yeah.
But I guess he could try
a little harder.
Let's not get our hopes up.
DIZ: Come on, Johnny.
COMPUTER VOICE: Come on, Johnny.
We are friends, aren't we?
We are friends, aren't we?
Johnny!

[BLOWS STRIKING]
[GRUNTING IN PAIN]
Try any stupid mind tricks,
and we will kill you.
Do you get me?
Yes, I get you
coming and going.
What the hell was that,
Carl?
Classic speech, Amy.
Really sorted things out
for the masses.
"If you love your family,
then you should
let me blow up Mars--"
Shut up.
[CARL GRUNTS]
The people need
an explanation, Carl.
And they prefer one that
tastes good and goes down easy.
This isn't
a popularity contest.
Leading the Federation
is about responsibility.
No. It's all
about ratings, Carl.
And you screwed
with mine.
I guess I know my enemy.
General Carl Jenkins,
you are hereby charged
with sedition
and conspiracy against
the United Citizen Federation.
At 1600 hours,
the Federal Council
will convene
to hear your case
and when you are found guilty,
witness your execution.
Is there anything
you wish to say at this time?
Yes.
I beg you, Amy.
Don't blow up Mars.
Take it back from the Bugs
and return it
to the Martian people.
Show them, show everyone
just how big
the Federation really is.
Too late.
Mars is fucked.
In a few hours,
you'll be dead, Carl.
Then I can
get back to work
and blow up Mars as a warning
to any future colony
that will not bend
to the Federal will.
It's an epic,
elegant revenge.
It's so you, Amy.
Except you went
and made me the fall guy.
[AMY GASPING]
You broke my nose!
You fuck!
Now it's your turn, Johnny.
Johnny.
God, no.
Diz, I kicked ass.
Yeah, trooper.
You kicked ass.
[ELECTRONIC BEEPING]
Battery's dead.
Can't move.
Let's get you out
of that.
Good idea.
[BODY ARMOR
THUMPING AND CLANKING]
It's good
to see you again, Johnny.
It's been too long,
that's for sure.
DIZ:
The last thing I remember
is that night in Tango Urilla.
You were everything
I ever wished for.
You were everything
and a bit more.
Where'd you learn
to do that, anyway?
Johnny!
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
It's true.
I wish it could've lasted
a lifetime.
Oh, Johnny.
You're making me cry.
You know
I fucking hate this shit.
You started it, Diz.
You got the whole ball
rolling, really.
I just
never picked it up.
Oh, stop it.
You were just fine,
Johnny.
Really.
There.
That old
terraforming tower?
Yeah.
It's there.
Just raring to blow.
Who wants
to blow up Mars, Diz, and why?
Unfortunately, that's
a long, sad story.
Which happens
to be classified.
Classified?
Diz?
DIZ:
 You'll find a way, Johnny.
 You always do.
Oh, my God!
Oh, crap, what now?
Colonel Rico's
still alive!
Well,
how's that's bad?
Well, it's not bad,
it's good.
But it means
we left a man behind.
Mobile Infantry
doesn't leave people behind.
That's right. Now it's
our turn to do some rescuing.
You mean
go back to Mars?
We gotta get Colonel Rico back.
Fuck, yeah!
Now, look here, amigos,
what you're talking about
is a one-way rocket
right back to Bug city.
We're
the Mobile Infantry.
It's time
to get mobile.
Yeah. Don't ask why.
Ask why not.
Well, okay.
But how am I supposed
to land without retros?
You're the pilot.
Look for someplace soft.
Too bad
your head's not bigger.

This is not good.
Oh, my God.
No.
Everybody, jump.
This landing
ain't gonna be pretty.
Hey, what about you?
I am a mighty
Martian warrior,
as good as y'all,
and probably a whole lot better.
[GEORGE GRUNTING]
Kill them all!
See you, coz.
CAMACHO:
I thought he was funny.
And at least
he went out with a bang.
Yeah.
Colonel!
All right.
It's so great
to see you, sir.
Yeah. We're kind
of running out of time.
What's the situation,
Lieutenant?
Well, sir, we thought
it was pretty bad.
No sign of the Fleet,
and you left behind on Mars,
and no connection
to FedNet, even.
The Federation's
blown us off, sir.
BABA: Why are they doing this?
ONE-OH-ONE: Left us behind, sir.
CAMACHO:
Is it because
we're Martians?
There are no Martians
in my Mobile Infantry.
Only troopers
who follow orders.
Awaiting your orders, sir.
Good.
Our next mission
begins immediately.
We need to get to
that old terraforming tower.
[PATRIOTIC FLOURISH PLAYS]
[ALARM SOUNDING]
 Fellow citizens,
 today is a sad day, indeed.
Mars has gone silent,
her surface overwhelmed
by Arachnids
with no sign of survivors,
military or civilian.
 We now stand
 at a critical juncture.
After weighing our options,
I now believe
there is
only one thing left to do.
We must dare to destroy Mars.
Our war against the Bugs
cannot be won by committee,
or by debate,
or by due process.
It can only be won
 by citizens who have
 the guts to do what's right.
 To make the hard decisions
 that will ensure our safety,
and indeed,
the survival of our species.
Oh, Mars.
We forgive you for your fleeting
captivation with independence.
 We will remember you
 for your frontier spirit
 and your sheer will
 to survive.
And most of all, your refusal to
let Bugs set foot on your soil.
 Long live Mars,
 the god of war.
 You have earned
 my deepest respect.
And by my authority
as sky marshal,
I hereby grant you
eternal rest
along with all those Bugs!
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
[COUNTDOWN BEEPING]
[BEEPING]
Huh?
 Sorry to interrupt,
 Sky Marshal,
 but someone
 has sabotaged MarsNet.
The citizens need to know
that we're still
in the fight for Mars.
What? No.
Captain.
I'm connected live
to Fort Kilo.
 The Mobile Infantry
 is alive and well.
But--
That's impossible.
See for yourself, Sky Marshal.
 Are we live?
BABA: We're on.
 Rico here.
 While engaging the enemy,
 we discovered a live Q-bomb.
 The thing was set
 to blow by mistake,
 so we shut
 the thing down, pronto.
 Yeah.
 Just in time too, thanks
 to some Martian troopers.
 Hope that wasn't a problem.
 We're gonna keep fighting,
 and we're gonna kill
 a lot of damn Bugs.
 Lost Patrol.
ALL:
 Hoo-ah!
 We got this!
 Mars ain't done for yet.
 We're gonna cook up
 some real Bug-BQ.
 [TROOPERS LAUGHING]
ONE-OH-ONE:
 With some sauce.
No. No.
 So don't you worry,
 Sky Marshal.
 We're still here,
 and we're gonna keep fighting.
 And we're gonna win!
TROOPERS:
 Hoo-ah!
CAMACHO:
Uh-oh! Colonel, look at that!
[♪♪♪]
RICO:
Well, here we go again.
Shit.
[SQUEALS]
RICO: Fire!
[GROANS]
It looks like all the Bugs
are coming to this picnic.
If only there were a way
to crash their little party.
BABA:
Sir, the Bugs are gonna
tear this place apart.
Geo.
What happens if
you turn that thing on?
GEO:
You mean, like,
make some weather?
I mean rip the sky apart.
Can you do that?
The core's power's still live.
I think we can manage.
Do it.
I want full power.
We're going
for balls-out overload.
Give me 10 minutes.
Hey, Camacho,
you wanna help?
You bet!
[BUGS SCREECHING]
Lost Patrol,
Geo needs 10 minutes.
Make sure he gets it.
DUTCH:
What happens after 10 minutes?
They gonna make it rain?
Like Bugs
give a shit about water.
BABA:
No, that ain't how it works.
They're gonna overload
the reactor
and blow up the atmosphere.
Well, what about us?
Oh, shit.
Flip everything to full power.
CAMACHO: You got it.
Seems easy enough.

No, but a little longer
would be okay.

Not yet, we don't.

Excuse me

We're in business.
That does it. This tower
is now one big weather bomb.
Good work, troopers.

Getting out?
Which way is out?

Fall back to the tower.
And then what?

We're Mobile Infantry.
We don't give up.
Fuck you!

in the house.

How high
we gonna go?
RICO:
Higher than the Bugs.
Oh, man.
They're everywhere, man.
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.
There's so many Bugs.
Are we gonna
make it out of here?
Who knows? I'm not ready
to give up yet. Are you?
What are you, some kind of hero?
BABA: Yeah.
Because a hero
always makes it back home.
I like that, Lieutenant.
If we live through this,
I might get it tattooed
on my ass.
Maybe I'll let you fight
in my Mobile Infantry after all.
CAMACHO:
Awesome.
CARMEN [OVER COMM]:
 Sounds like you guys are
 having fun down there.
RICO: Is that you, Carmen?
CARMEN: Yeah.
RICO: Where are you?
I'm heading in now.
But you're

 You can fly through anything.

Nowhere to touch down.

Uh, colonel?
What?
I'm thinking
we got two minutes.
Maybe less.
CAMACHO: Colonel.
RICO: Now what?
CAMACHO:
Over there.
On the other side of the tower.
They're piling up
the wall.
Roger that, Camacho.
You hear that, Carmen?
No time.
Open the hatch and hover.
What's the plan?
Just open the hatch.
Just a simple question.
Come on, you apes.

It's great to see you too.
Doesn't that chair belong

She's taking
a couple of personal days.
I'm just keeping things moving
until she gets back.
I'd never dream
of being sky marshal.
So Amy Snapp's just gonna
get away with it?
That's politics,
Johnny boy.
Did you know there were Bugs
on Mars too, Carl?
Hmph.
And you just let it happen?
Carmen.
How could you even think
such a thing?
Very funny.
But this is the war
we can never stop fighting.
The Bugs will never quit.
And if we do,
we're dead.
For a few thousand years,
we humans enjoyed
the relative peace
of fighting amongst ourselves.
And then we reached
for the stars.
I mean,
what did we think
would happen?
Well, thinking's your job,

I'm the guy
who follows orders.
I like that.
Now, go take back Mars

I wonder what you'd do

that Sky Marshal Snapp
let the Bugs start
a colony on Mars
so she'd have
an excuse to blow it up.
Is that what
you're telling me, sir?
I'm saying
everyone's got a right
to fight
for what's theirs,
maybe most especially
Martians.
From one Martian to another,
good work, Lieutenant.
Tomorrow,
we kill them all again.
See you on the bounce.
