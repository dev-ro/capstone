- Good morning, Mrs. Saadet.
- Good morning.
Good morning to you too,
Mr. Kazim.
Thank you, Mr. Nuri.
I'd like to have a kilo of
pickled aubergines.
<- Look after Mr. Nuri.
- You do it!
You see I am doing numbers.
I am not an octopus!
God give me mercy!
I see you two are
having fights again.
I don't know what to say.
Don't know! Don't know!
Say whatever you want!
Shut up, woman!
Don't make me angry!
YOU don't make me angry!
God, why you never
understand a single word!
Watch your mouth!
Don't start again.
- What happens if I do?
- Shush. It's not nice.
You are grown ups.
Aren't you ashamed of fighting
every single day?
You're right. Here.
Bon appétit!
Thank you.
Look at me. How many times...
...have I have told you not to argue with
with me in front of others?  - Many times!
So why aren't you keeping
your mouth shut, woman?
Why should I?
You shout, I keep quiet.
How nice!
Sure. But, keep this in your mind:
I know this pickle business
better than you do.
I know it better than you do.
Saadet, please don't be stubborn.
Don't make me mad.
- I know it!
- I know it!
Me!
God, you don't even know the best
way to make pickle juice!
- It's with vinegar.
- You bet! It's with lemon.
It wouldn't taste anything
without vinegar!
- Lemon!
- Vinegar!
God, give me mercy so that
I don't cause any accident.
- Guess who am I?
- Ziya.
Where did you come from?
I missed you so much and
I came back to see you.
Stop lying. It hasn't even
been a month since you left.
- What's the real deal?
- I swear, I missed you.
Really? Look, Ziya, I am angry. Stop
lying and tell me why you came back.
- Why?
- They deported me.
- Why?
- Well...
...in Germany, they don't allow
illegal immigrants to work.
Haven't I told you this before
you went to Germany?
>- Yes, you did, but...
- Ziya.
- Aunty!
- Let me kiss you, aunty!
- So you are back?
Yes. I missed you so much
so I came back to see you.
My thoughtful son.
My dear one.
So, where else did you go
in Germany, Uncle Ziya?
- I went on lion hunting...
- Ziya!
What, bro?
You keep lying to kids all along.
But I can't take it anymore.
There aren't any lions in Germany!
Why not, bro?
<- There aren't as many lions as
there are in Africa, but there are a few.
<- German lions, German!
- Uncle, tell us about this lion hunting.
- Yes.
So, we went to the woods with friends.
Got off the Jeep. Scattered around.
Got my rifle in my hand.
Moving slowly. And then...
Yeah?
- I saw it!
- Saw what?
- The lion!
- The lion?
It was just a few meters away!
You wouldn't believe your eyes.
- Oh my god! It was 10 meters tall!
- The lion was 10 meters tall?
Ziya!
- Well, even if it wasn't 10 meters, it was about 5.
- Ziya!
So, the lion was as tall as a lion.
I held my rifle. And then...
I realised there aren't any bullets in it!
- Oh boy!
- God! And then?
Thanks to God I had my Swiss
army knife on me.
- Then what, Uncle?
- Jumped on the lion.
Into it's belly, bam bam bam!
Ziya! Did you kill the lion
with a Swiss army knife?
I killed it! Yes, I killed it!
I spread its legs into two!
Shut up! Or I am
going to kill you now!
Don't confuse the kids
with your lies!
Oh my god, bro!
You are not up to yourself today.
You are angry with my aunty
and you are taking it from me.
- It's nothing like that.
- Well done, Ziya. You are right.
Look at his face! He's got
a face like a wet weekend.
Only if he was right.
Hang on, you be the judge.
Here. Drink this.
- How is it?
- Great.
See? What did he say?
Great. Why?
Because the best way to make
pickle juice is with vinegar.
Woman! It's with lemon! Lemon!
Wait, you'll see it now.
Here, take it.
And tell me what you think.
This is mine. Drink this.
- What do you think?
- This is great too.
It can't be.
Make your mind.
Which one is great.
That one or this one?
- Yes, make a decision.
- OK.
Well, I don't know what to say.
Both are great.
Damn you! Liar!
- I swear both are great, bro!
- Shut up! You liar, you sucker!
It's my fault I accepted you back into
my house! I am getting rid of you!
- Get the hell out of my house!
- Stop!
I say get out, get out!
Look, you are breaking my heart.
If you don't stop, I will leave.
Don't even stay for a second.
I say get out!
- Aunty, look at him!
- You're getting rid of him again?
- Yes! Get the hell out of here!
- OK.
Look, if I go, I will never come back.
Are you still talking you God dammit?
Get the hell out of my house!
Get out! God damn you!
- Do you regret it?
- Get out!
OK!
- Crazy man!
- Aren't you crazy?
If you weren't crazy, you
wouldn't have got rid of your brother.
Look at me, woman! Don't make me do
something I will regret. Shut up! Shut up!
I will not shut up!
I will not!
Look at me, woman!
I am going to beat you down!
Do it if you can!
I will strangle you!
- Leave me alone!
- I had enough of you!
- I will kill you!
- So will I!
- Get the hell out of this house!
- Sure!
I will take my kids with me
and leave. Let's go kids!
>- Go wherever you can.
- Let's go! Let's go!
Yeah right! As if you brought
them from your father's house!
- You cannot take a single thing!
- They would all want me.
What would they do with a witch like you?
God damn you!
Let's go, kids! I say let's go!
Children, don't go with that crazy man.
If you love your mother, stay with me.
Is that so? I am going with my children
who want to be with me. Let's go!
Go to hell!
I'd go to hell if I wasn't going to see you there.
Let's go! Let's go!
I hope you go there and never come back!
Dad, aren't we going to
see our mother anymore?
There is no mother anymore.
I will slap you if you ever
say "mother" from now on.
- Mum, isn't my father coming back any more?
- Shut up! The word "father" is banned in this house.
- I will slap you if you ever say "father".
- So mum, what's next?
What's next? We'll divorce.
Everybody goes their own way.
I'll move the house and the shop.
He will not be able to find me anymore.
OUR STORE IS CLOSED
Look at these pants.
Two cows would fit into it.
And he is jumping ropes
still to lose some weight.
What to say? He is
dying to go to the army.
- Where's your button?
- Here.
Dad, at least let us sew
our own buttons.
We are grown ups now.
No! How many times have I told you?
I am both your mother and father.
So this makes it my job.
You focus on your lessons, that's enough for me.
>- If you don't pass this year,
you won't finish the high school.
- Is Mehmet still in bed?
- He's sleeping. Came back late from work.
My dear boy. At this rate the
university will not open this year.
So he's working at Kamil's place
for some pocket money.
To help me out.
Here.
See to the tea yourself.
I'm going to hang the clothes.
- Good morning, dad.
- Good morning.
I think I lost 3 kilos this morning.
So what? As long as
you keep eating like this...
...you lose it one way, you gain it the other.
No I won't. I am determined
to go to the army this year.
Good. But I am not really hopeful.
<- How can a human lose 40 kilos in one month?
<- You'll see.
<- And the Doctor Lieutenant promised me.
Even if I lose 30, he'll take me in.
- It's enough exercise this morning.
- If you say so.
Mr. Kazim.I see you're on duty again!
Oh well, Miss Sidika. You know,
I am both a mother and a father.
No, Mr. Kazim. If you run after two
hares, you will catch neither.
You need a lady.
Don't make me laugh, Miss Sidika.
Who would want me anymore?
Don't say that!
You're a hung man!
What you need is someone who is
at my age, an elegant widow!
Besides, a woman who's been
with a husband before is something else.
She would de anything you want.
Is that so?
Isn't it, isn't it?
- Oh my god.
- Mom!
Jesus! You scared the hell out of me!
Stop it. I caught you again.
What are you talking about,
for god's sake?
What am I talking about? You are
all over him all the time.
Don't be rude! God save me
from false accusations!
Can't a neighbour talk
to her neighbour?
I pity for him so I say
he should get married to someone.
You ask him to get married, but you
describe yourself as his bride!
It's rude! After my deceased father,
you've gone through three more husbands!
You never have enough!
You think about yourself when your
one and only daughter is still single.
Shame on you.
Yasar. I try not to be involved
but I can't stand anymore.
What happened, dad?
What happened?
You just lost a few grams,
now you are gaining 10 kilos!
- Come in, Mr. Kamil.
- No, thanks.
<- Come in. Come in.
- Good morning, madam!
- Good morning to you too!
- Is Mehmet still in bed?
- I don't know...
I'm here Mr. Kamil.
- Hello.
- Hello, son.
Here.
Here, Mr. Kamil. Last night's proceeds.
Something's wrong with the back tyre.
Mum! I was just wondering where the chubby
one has disappeared in the morning.
I should have guessed! Give it
to me. You'll hurt your back.
No way! I haven't hurt my back for the last 12
years so don't worry about it, my son.
- At least let me do the heavy work.
- No! I am not complaining.
I can't watch you do it, mum!
Don't worry. I am both your
mother and your father.
- My dear mother.
- My dear son.
<- My one and only son.
I love you so much.
<- Look at these love birds.
But we are human too,
we get jealous.
Don't be silly and come to the table.
I will bring your teas.  - Sure.
Yasar, my son!
You just finished a whole loaf
of bread back at home.
What's wrong with you?
You are going to explode.
I don't know.
I am suddenly hungry.
Maybe I've got worms
in my stomach?
<- A worm doesn't eat this much.
<- You must have an elephant in there.
Understood? An elephant.
Dad!
<- What's wrong son?
Are you still hungry?
Do you want some desert?
Tell me, son, what's wrong?
- Guess who's here?
- Ziya. Welcome.
- How are you?
- Good, bro.
- Welcome, Uncle.
- You, plump!
- Are you on vacation?
- Something like that.
Fire department of Izmit should
be very proud of me.
I became a manager in no time, huh!
Leave that aside and
answer the boy's question.
He asked you "are you on vacation?"
No.
I got fired.
It was obvious. How many
times have you got fired by now?
What have you done this time?
It was not my fault this time.
We went to a fire that just began.
A little accident.
I took a bowl of water...
...and when I threw it on water... BOOM!
Apparently there was petrol in the bucket.
That's why they fired me.
So is this my fault now?
No, my son.
It's not your fault at all.
Excuse me!
These buses are so uncomfortable.
It's my first time.
Is it crowded like this only in the
mornings or all the time?
How about you?
Are you beautiful like this...
...all the time or just in the mornings?
How about you?
Are you cold like this...
...all the time or just in the mornings?
- Good morning, my queen.
- Pickle juice in the morning, again?
You bet! We just had a bit
too much to drink last night.
When are you not having
too much to drink, Mr. Nazif?
Oh! I feel like I am going to die!
If you keep drinking like this
you will die for real one day.
What to do, Miss Saadet.
It's being single, it's loneliness.
Only if I could find someone around my age,
someone as good a widow as you are...
...I'd get married that instant.
- I hope you find her one day. I hope so.
Wait a minute!
I am going to ask one final question.
- Go ahead.
- Are you working in this factory?
Yes. Is that a problem for you?
No. On the contrary, I like it.
Good morning, dad!
You can't soften me like this.
You either work properly...
...or you pack your bags.
Understood?
- Now get out of my room.
- Yes, sir.
See? If you don't treat
your employees properly...
...they will not respect you.
- I saw it, dad.
- Hello.
- You, again?
How did you come inside?
Get out or I will call the security.
- You can't do that.
- Why not?
- Because I own this place.
- The owner of this place is Mr. Halis.
- Yeah, I am his son.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. So, when are we going on a date?
- Never!
I don't think you've heard me.
I said I am the boss' son.
How insolent are you.
Do I have to go to bed with you...
... just because you are the boss' son?
Get out of my way!
Wait a minute.
- See you at 8 this evening.
- Sure, at 8PM.
Sorry.
- Bon appétit.
- Join us.
I just had some.
What are you reading?
Physics. Not much left
for the university exams.
Keep studying so that you can get a proper
job and then take me to posh places.
I hope so.
We are supposed to meet tonight, right?
- Yes. Did you forget about it?
- No, not at all.
But I can't make it tonight.
My uncle's family are coming to us.
- You're not mad at me, are you?
We'll go out tomorrow night. - Sure.
Here. It's not my job to ask, Miss Saadet,
but I am just curious.
How come you and your daughter eat
this many pickles every night?
My heart burns, Mr. Kazım.
My heart!
And pickles make me feel better.
Have a good day.
- Good day, bon appétit.
- Good bye.
Dad, this woman has her eye on you.
I swear.
Don't be silly!
You eat pickles every night.
Don't you feel sick, Mr. Nazif?
No. Alcohol kills pickles.
Pickles cut alcohol...
...so they are made for each other.
Besides, I am also a single man.
Don't start, Mr. Nazif.
Don't be stubborn, Miss Saadet.
Say "yes" and we get married.
You'll see, we will be very happy.
Don't be silly. How many times have
I told you that I don't like jokes like this?
Take your pickles and get drunk
at home. Understood?
Crazy man!
You buy pickles every single day
so you can see Mr. Kazim!
I'm sick of pickles now.
So what? I am young after all.
I am the one who is young!
And you are pickling me!
Come on. Stop talking
on a sad day like this.
I'm cooking in memory of
my late fourth husband.
You will cook in memory of me at this rate.
Mum! Listen to this whistle.
- Mum! This is his whistle.
- Yes, this is Ziya.
- Mum, he's back for me.
- Go on, go to the garden.
- OK.
- Hey! Look at me.
Listen! Let him touch you
but don't go too far.
- Otherwise he won't take you later on.
- Ok, mum.
Welcome, the unfaithful one.
Finally you remembered me.
Oh my darling, how can I forget you?
Come on.You didn't even write me a line.
You're right. But, look...
...I even left my job and came back for you.
- You liar.
You broke my heart.
Let's kiss and make up for it.
No way. My mum said show but don't
let him touch you before the wedding.
Come on, darling, not much left for the
wedding. As soon as I sort my...
...things out, I will come and
ask for your mother's permission.
- Really?
- Of course.
- Wait a minute!
- Stop, girl. Just on the cheek.
<- My mum gets mad, don't.
- Don't make me swear at your mother.
- Not before the wedding.
Uncle!
We're busted!
What, dude?
Dad is calling you for dinner.
I'm coming.
Good night.
You too.
- You just found the right time to come.
- I see you're finding your way with Nilgun?
She's all over me, but I keep
her at my arm's length
That's the way you should treat women.
Go on, you never saw us. Walk!
What happened, Uncle?
Why are you hitting me?
In a press conference, Ziya Muezzinoglu,
the Minister of Finance said...
What are you going to do next?
- I can't decide.
- What can't you decide, uncle?
Whether I should get into politics or not.
<- Which party, Uncle?
<- Haven't decided yet.
Both Demirel and Ecevit keep calling me.
They keep asking me to join them.
I don't know what to do.
<- Will they take you into the parliament?
What do you say, Uncle?
Parliament? They are offering me ministry.
- Minister of what, Uncle?
- Well...
Minister of what? Minister of lies!
- Come on, bro.
- Shut up. You're going too far now.
Hello, Miss Sidika.
I made some donuts. Couldn't eat
without sharing with you so here you go.
But you are making us feel
embarrassed, Miss Sidika.
What's wrong with this?
Your kids are my kids too.
- Isn't it true, Mr. Ziya?
- You're too kind.
- Eat my son, bon appétit.
- Thank you.
I shall leave. Good bye.
Thank you and good bye.
- Good night.
- Good night Miss Sidika.
What's going on?
Why are you laughing?
As long as this boy has his appetite
and this woman has these foods...
...you take this Sidika.
- Don't be silly.
- Dad, I'm going if that's ok.
- I thought you aren't working tonight?
Well, I am meeting friends and
we are going to the cinema.
OK.
Bro, you haven't said anything
about my razor business?
I have, I won't give you a penny.
Come on, bro. I swear
this is the last time.
Only one thousand liras.
Believe me, I am sorting
myself out this time.
Look, Ziya. How many times?
Here is the house, here is the food. You are
my brother, you can eat, drink and sleep...
...but you can no longer take
a penny from me.
- You are breaking my heart.
- I wish.
- You broke my heart. I am leaving.
- Go ahead. Go.
- I won't come back.
- Don't.
You will regret this.
- Get the hell out of here.
- OK.
Dad, my dad.
- Uncle.
- I am here.
- Welcome, Uncle.
- Is my aunty here?
- Yes.
- Good.
- Good evening, Aunty.
- Uncle.
Dude, come over here.
- Aunty.
- Welcome, Ziya.
Thank you. I missed you so much
and I came back to you my dear Aunty.
Good good. "Little House on the Prairie"
is so touching this evening.
We'll chat when it's over.
Sit, sit down, my son.
Oh god, what's wrong
with the Little House?
- Are you touched too?
- You are right, Aunty, this is so touching.
- Promise me, Mehmet.
- For what?
- If you ever have so much money,
you'll take me to posh places. - OK.
- I'm tired of these third class bars.
- Sure.
My dear Aunty. Only if my unfaithful
so called brother wasn't there...
...we'd all be living a different life.
Don't even mention his name.
Have you seen his face?
Me? May the devil take him.
I haven't seen him for 12 years.
I don't even know if he's alive.
If he was gone, my children would have found me.
So, what have you been up to?
I don't like this fireman business...
...it's been too hard, being away from you all.
My dear son.
So I decided to get into
the razor business.
- Good for you, my son.
- But this business needs some capital.
How much?
- Just one thousand liras.
- Oh sure, I'll give it to you.
You're the one and only aunt!
This is the best razor.
All the famous people on earth
shave themselves with this razor.
The King of England,
late President Kennedy...
...Pele, the King of Football,
Beckenbauer...
...Mayer, the goalkeeper,
Nadia Comaneci...
...Bridgette Bardo,
Cemil, from Fenerbahce.
All owe their fame to this razor.
Yes, it's free to try.
Without a penny.
Look, for example, this citizen's
beard seems to have grown...
...in two minutes, without any water,
any soap. - Oh god.
It will be over in no time.
Look at this, my brothers.
Last wonder of science.
A German magic...
...the razor of all famous people.
- Stop it!
You stop! You don't know
how lucky you are today.
Yes, brothers.
Watch carefully.
Look. No water, no soap.
Gibigibicis branded cream...
...which is a gift from us to you...
...my dear brothers.
Yes. Look. Look at your watches.
In just 17 seconds, it is over.
One... Two...
Three... Four...
Five... Six...
Here's seven. Nearly done. Eight.
- Enough!
- Please keep calm.
Enough! I'm covered in blood!
Don't panic. We also sell a relief
cream for cuts. Come over here.
- Walk to the police station, you son of a bitch!
- Help me! They are killing a man here!
How's it going?
You, again? Please, leave me alone.
I can't. If I do, my dad won't pay me.
- Why?
- Because I work here from now on.
- Wasn't your old job better than this one?
- What was my old job?
Just wandering around and bothering girls.
Not all of them.
Just the most beautiful one.
I've never seen anybody
as stubborn as you.
I am. I am the only kid in the family.
You know my father.
But my mum is such an angel.
She loves me so much.
Does everything I ask.
So I was raised spoiled.
You can tell.
So, what do you want from me?
Become friends.
Shall we meet on Sunday?
Why for?
Because I enjoy being with you.
Aren't we together at work?
Yeah, work. I no longer work there.
Because I met you.
- It's late. I must go.
No. I won't let you go before
you promise for Sunday.
OK.
- Mr. Kazim.
- What's up?
Your brother has cut
someone's throat at the cafe.
- What?
- The police are calling you.
What's wrong, Officer?
What has he done again?
- Don't ask. He was selling razors
at the cafe. - Razors?
- Yes, bro. Let me explain.
- You shut up... And?
That's it. He wanted to try the razors on this
gentleman's face, without his consent.
And this gentleman is now raising
a complaint against him, of course.
I told him that Ziya is not a bad man.
I also told him that you are
a respectful man in the community.
So this gentleman was very understanding and
he is withdrawing his complaint against Ziya.
But you should apologise and thank him.
I am really sorry, sir. Thank you.
Don't worry about it.
- My brother is a piece of shit.
- Why do you say that, bro?
Shut up! He made a mistake, and you
forgave him. Thank you, sir.
- Now you two make up for it.
- As a courtesy for you forgiving me...
- Here, here.
- ...I would like to...
...give you this little gift.
- I don't want it.
- Take it, take it.
- I don't want it! I said I don't want it!
...I don't want it.
Oh my god, I don't want it!
Why did you bother, bro?
I could have sorted it out myself.
God damn you, are you still talking? Dude,
you'd have been jailed had he not forgiven you.
Don't worry about it. The Minister of Interior is
a close friend of mine. I'd have called him.
Look at me, dude.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!
Look, Mehmet, take him.
I don't want to see his face.
Otherwise I will do something I will
regret later on. Enough is enough!
- Come, Uncle.
- Get off me. Oh my god.
It's always my fault.
- Promise me, Ahmet.
- What for?
- Please take me to Maksim one day.
- Will do, when I have money.
Evening business is a good one, Uncle.
Drunks pay good money.
Is that so?
Wait for a sec, Uncle.
I just saw a friend.
- Mehtap?
- Mehmet!
What are you doing here?
Who is this guy?
Hey, hey! Slow down!
Who are you?
I'll deal with you later.
I said who is this man?
- Get off me.
- Leave her alone you son of a bitch!
Oh my god.
>- I'll kill you.
Son of a bitch!
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
- What's going on?
- Mehmet, stop!
- Take this, you prick!
I said stop!
Come here!
Ahmet!
- You?
- Uncle.
- I said...
- Stop. Mehmet, don't!
- You stay away, Uncle.
- You can't, stop!
- Get off me, Uncle!
- He is your brother! Your brother!
- What did you say?
- I said he is your brother!
Your own brother. How can you
fight with each other?
My brother?
So, that's it. What do you think?
- I'm shocked.
- Me too.
- Are you hurt?
- Don't worry about it.
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
I wouldn't have recognised had my
uncle not been there. You've changed a lot.
- You too.
- We used to sleep together, remember?
Yes. My dad had bought us a ball.
And on the first day, I had broken...
...the barber's window. And you had claimed
it was your fault.
You had always stood up for me. I used
to cry when mum used to beat you up.
Being brothers are awesome.
It is, but, what am I going to do now?
- What happened to you, Uncle?
- What happened?
Neither your mum nor your dad knows
I am in contact with both of them.
They'd kill me if they find out.
Now you two have met...
- Don't worry, Uncle. We won't tell.
- These are my boys!
Wow! I love you guys!
<- Zeynep... Zeynep.
- What? Are you ill?
- No.
- Why did you wake me up then?
I have some very important news.
Couldn't wait till the morning.
Guess who I just saw?
- Mehmet.
- Who's Mehmet?
- Our brother.
- Our brother?
- Tell me all about it now.
- Then what happened?
So we talked.
I felt so weird.
Especially when I learned he's my brother.
You should see him! So handsome!
- He looks like me then.
- He said "handsome" you stupid.
- Then? What did you do?
- Talked about the old days...
...I was almost going to cry.
- Did he ask about me?
Did he ask what has Omer been up to?
- Of course he has.
- I wish we've seen him too.
- And the others.
- We'll see them all.
We are meeting on Sunday.
- Oh my god!
Calm down, dude. You are
going to wake my dad up!
- I can't help it.
- Shush.
Drink this, it helps you to digest it.
Eat one more desert.
- No, bro, it's enough.
- You haven't changed, Yasar.
- He's only 130 kgs.
- How do I look, Zeynep?
- Hot as ever.
- Hot my ass.
- They always make fun of me.
- They are jealous of you, Omer.
- True.
- Do you remember my dad?
- I dreamed about him once.
- I nearly remember my mum.
- She was short and chubby, that's all.
- She still is.
- I'm so curious about my father.
- I'm curious about my mother.
Isn't it weird, kids? Three of us,
don't know our mother...
...and three of us don't know our father.
- Why has it been like this, sister?
It has been like this, somehow.
Let's toast our drinks for us!
You're right.
- Hello, young boy.
- Hello.
Are you looking at the pickles?
My pickles are the best in town.
If you want some, come,
have a glass of pickle juice.
Don't worry. It's on me. They
say it's the eye's merit to this.
I have sons like you. Come on.
Don't be shy. Sit down here.
- Where do you live?
- In Sariyer.
It's too far from Samatya.
What are you doing here?
Have you escaped from the school?
Lost your way on the way home?
- No I haven't escaped. I came from there.
- So you are visiting someone with your family?
Here. And tell me if you ever
drank anything like this before.
Take it, don't be shy.
I can't buy you coffee.
A pickle seller's gift would be pickle juice.
Let me give you a pickle too.
- What does your father do?
- He is a pickle seller.
A pickle seller?
Who is he? What's his name?
Kazim.
- Kazim?
- Yes. You are my father.
- Pardon me?
- I am your son.
- You... You are my...
- Yes. I am your son, Tuncay.
- Tuncay? My youngest son?
- Yes.
Let me have a look...
My son.
- Daddy! My dear dad!
- My dear son!
Let me have a look at you.
You have become a man!
You were a little kid.
How has this happened?
How come I didn't recognise you?
Of course, how could I?
How about the others?
Your sister, your brother?
How did you come here?
Who sent you here?
- I came here myself. To see you.
- Really? On your own?
Good...
You could have told me
that you are not going to come.
- How do you feel about it now?
- You are right, I am sorry.
- But believe me something very important
has come. - So you would've come otherwise?
Of course!
- So, tell me more.
- I don't know. I think I told you all.
I need to go now.
My mum will start getting worried.
- I'll come again later on.
- Of course, you've got to go.
But you can't go all the way
to Sariyer on your own.
It's late. I'll take you there.
- I wouldn't want to bother you.
- Bother me? You are my son!
- My dear dad!
My son.
- Let's go now before it gets too dark.
- You're right, but I don't want to...
...leave you. I've never felt like this.
I always think about you day and night.
Am I in love?
- I don't know.
- I think I am.
- Please, let's go.
- OK.
- Take it easy, Mehmet.
- Thanks, Uncle.
You're going to get rid of
this old piece of junk soon.
- Your Uncle is going to buy you a brand new car.
- Have you found an oil well?
No. I started doing a wholesale
wedding candy business. You carry on.
Thank you.
- You'll see. We'll get rich in no time.
- I don't want money. I want a husband.
When you have money, you'll have a husband.
You'll see. Soon, I'll ask for your mother's blessing.
You liar.
- Liar, huh? What is this then?
- Wedding candy! Is it ours?
No! This is not ours!
I started trading this.
There is a lot of money in it.
Oh! You hurt my shoulder!
- My wild man.
- Aren't I.
- Are we there yet? Is the house nearby?
- Yes, dad.
Maybe we should split up here.
Well... Your siblings...
...they should be home by now, right?
- Yes.
I say, since I came
all the way here...
...maybe I should see them too?
- What do you say?
- It would be great!
Where is this boy? He's
never late like this.
Where have you been? I swear
you're going to get a smack from me.
What can I do, mum? The teacher
punished all of us and didn't let us go.
What kind of a teacher is that?
Anyway, wash your hands and face...
...dinner is almost ready.
Come here. This wasn't a proper lie.
Where were you?
- I was with my dad.
- What? Dad?
My mum will hear. I couldn't wait
and I went to see him.
And he brought me all the way here.
He is waiting for you guys.
He said he would like to see you.
- Where?
- In the patisserie.
Let's go, Ahmet.
No. I won't go to the man who left us.
But... OK, we are going.
Tell my mum we went to
by some notepad for Tuncay.
- Zeynep. My daughter!
- Dad! My dear dad!
My daughter.
My daughter. Have a seat.
Come, you sit down too.
Let me have a look at you.
You have become a proper woman.
- Would you have recognised me had
you seen me on the street? - Of course.
Maybe I wouldn't have recognised you.
You have grown so much.
You have become so beautiful.
- But I have missed you all this time.
- If it was true, you would've looked for us.
Where? I didn't even know you
guys were living in Istanbul.
Your mother took you away from the
old house without leaving a single trace.
Where is Ahmet?
Is he ill?
He said "I won't go to the man who left
and never came back to look for us."
- Is that so?
- Don't you think he's right, even for a little bit, sir?
I guess so. Your mother!
It's all her fault!
She is the most stubborn, hussy person on the
planet! God save everyone from her viraginity!
- From who? My mum?
- Yes.
Let's talk about something else.
Sure.
It's coming up to eight o'clock.
Where's my brother been?
While I was at the races,
he closed the shop early.
And you looked at the cafe,
he wasn't there either, was he?
- No, he wasn't.
- Are you worried?
I am not, but I am hungry.
Maybe the anarchists
kidnapped my brother?
What do you think they will do a with
a penniless pickle seller? Pickle him?
This must be him.
- Good evening.
- We've got worried, dad.
Really? Why can't I be late like you
guys always are? I had a business to do.
What's up, bro? Where were you?
- I was with a girl.
- With a girl?
What a girl she was!
What are you looking at?
Can't I meet a girl?
- You should have brought her here.
- Maybe, that will happen too one day.
- Good god. What else?
- Not just her.
There was a beautiful kid with her too.
- What! She's got a kid too?
- No. It's not her kid. It's her brother.
Tuncay! And the girl's name is Zeynep.
She is your sister!
Tuncay is your little brother!
- Our brother.
- Oh my god!
Did they say anything about me?
No, we didn't talk about you.
But they asked about their brothers.
Dad, tell me the truth. Did you
really meet Zeynep and Tuncay?
- Why can't I? Is it forbidden to see them?
- So we can see them too, right?
Of course you can. Who can say anything
against siblings meeting each other?
- So can we see them?
- Of course you can.
So Ziya, what have you got to say
about this after all these years?
Nothing. It's not my business.
I don't know anything about it. That's it.
Do you want anything?
I want you, my son.
Well, you...
Yes, don't be afraid to say it.
Your father. I am your father!
You didn't come to me.
So, here, I came to you.
Dads have a soft heart.
If you ever become a dad...
...you'll understand what I mean.
Dad. My dad!
My son.
Huseyin. Huseyin. Look, who's here.
- My dad, my dear dad.
- I'm very glad to have met you.
Me too.
145, 150 and that would be all.
Your business was good today.
- 12 wedding ceremonies.
- Take your money and have a good day.
It's the wedding season. I wish them all
the happiness and health together.
I'll get it, darling.
Are you here for Ahmet?
Let me call him.
Zeynep! Call Ahmet.
His friends are here.
Mother.
My sons! Omer.
Yasar.
Mehmet.
Oh my god! I almost didn't
recognise my own sons!
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Call your brothers.
My darling. Don't wait, go!
Come here, let me introduce you to your brothers.
Thank you God for letting me see this day.
Mum, we already know each other.
What! You know each other?
So you found your brothers...
...and you didn't tell me?
I will never forgive you.
- Don't go. Dinner is ready.
- We can't stay for dinner.
We'll be late.
Dad will get worried.
Who is your dad!
He should go to hell!
I found my kids after all these years.
How can I let them go without food?
I made pasta.
What! You made pasta?
Oh, my little bird.
- Ziya. Ziya!
- What's up, bro?
- What are you doing, dude?
- Tweeting, bro.
- Tweeting?
- Yes.
Stop being silly.
Otherwise you're going to get a smack.
Where have the kids been?
I'm starting to get worried.
- Maybe they've got something else to do.
- All three of them? It's unusual.
Maybe they found three girls...
Don't be silly.
Cut it out.
I said cut it out.
Cut that bloody tweeting!
- Yasar, you are gonna explode. This is your third
plate. - Don't worry. He's always been like this.
- But we must go.
- Without eating Noah's pudding?
- What? You've made pudding?
- Of course!
- Dad will go mad.
- Go to hell with him.
This is the payback time for
all the misery he's made me go through.
- But we are too late.
- Oh well, Mehmet.
As long as my mum cooks like this and
he's got this appetite, we'll always be late.
- Go on. Eat this too.
- We will, we will.
- Ziya!
- What?
I'm going to the police.
- Police? Why, what happened?
- The kids haven't come back yet.
I am beginning to get worried.
I will go and have a look.
Oh my god, where have you been?
- Forgive us, dad. We're late.
- But you'd forgive us if you knew where we were.
Oh well, let's eat dinner so you can tell me.
I've warmed the dinner up three times.
Dinner? Oh God.
Where have you all been?
So, where were you?
- We went to see our siblings.
- Your siblings?
Yes, are you mad?
Why should I be mad at you for
going to see your siblings?
It's OK. Where did you see them?
- Where? At their home.
- Their home?
- Did you see that bitch too?
- Who's that bitch, dad?
Who? That one.
- The mother of your siblings.
- Of course we have.
- I bet she was all over you.
- Hell she was.
- But we kept her at arm's length.
- Good.
You must've been hungry all these time.
Did you eat at that bitch's house?
She made pasta and Noah's pudding.
What?! Did you eat?
Of course we didn't. We said
dad would wait. Didn't we?
<- Of course, we didn't eat.
- Good.
Well done.
- What's up, Mehmet? Why aren't you eating?
- I don't know. I don't have the appetite.
Of course, nobody would have any appetite
after seeing that bitch. My poor kids.
- Dad, do you know what my mum said?
- Look. I don't want to hear the word "mum".
It is forbidden to use that word in this house.
Understood? No mention of her name here.
God damn her.
Eat your food.
He's really going to explode this time.
Then, what happened?
After all those pasta and pudding,
and then eating my dad's food...
- Poor boy.
- Didn't you feel sick, bro?
Sick? Of course. I felt terrible.
<- Come on, don't bullshit me.
Mehmet, look...
- Mehmet, look at yours.
- She's not mine, she's yours.
- Let's teach them a lesson.
- Let's go.
- What's going on?
- Nothing, we'll be back in a minute. Let's go.
What's happening to these guys?
- Shall we go to the movies?
- Sure, darling.
Turkan Soray's film is on.
Let's go to that one.
- Mehtap.
- Darling.
Mehmet! Ahmet!
- Who are these?
- Let me explain, well...
- I'll explain. We are brothers.
- I am the 6th boyfriend of this little lady.
<- And I am the 7th.
- But she's a good girl.
- Enjoy, if you can keep up with her lies.
- OK?
- That's it bro. Have a good day.
Well, them...
- The lad is tough.
- He took our revenge.
What the hell is going on?
- Something is going on but we don't understand.
- Don't worry. It's a long story.
Let's deal with our own business.
- Listen to Yasar.
- Well...
Are we always going to
meet in cafe corners like this?
- You're damn right. We have to end this.
- Of course.
Look kids, my mum can't stop
talking about you since she saw you.
All day she goes on about
Omer, Yasar, Mehmet.
- As if we haven't been her kids all
these years.  - Same with dad.
- So what's that supposed to mean?
- It means this:
Both of them would love their kids
to be together.
- Sure.
- Since we also want to be together...
Yes.
- So let's bring them together.
- Well, this is not easy.
- They are both stubborn as hell.
- No, they are both being kids.
But we are grown ups now.
So we should act like grown ups and
sort these two kids out.
Shall we beat both of them, kids?
I don't know what we are supposed to do,
but we'll figure a way out.
It would be great if we could
stop this Successor.
Let him ride it a bit more.
He is not going to be able to do it later on.
Go on.
- I've never seen him this happy.
- And look at me, I've never seen...
- Uncle, which one is your favourite?
- All three of them are shit.
- What? You don't even like Farah?
- Which one is Farah?
<- The blonde one, Uncle.
<- Look at her. Oh God.
- Is she the toothy one?
<- Toothy?
>- I mean, is it the one who keeps smiling?
>- Yeah.
She's the worst of all.
Look, kids.
- When I was in America....
- When you were in where?
- America.
- Hmm, America.
Yes.
Friends called me to a special party.
This Farah was there too.
She was a crowd artist back then though.
- She was all over me but I kept her.
at arm's length.  - Go on, Uncle!
Ziya, we all know you are talking bullshit.
But at least make them a bit more believable.
Bro, you don't believe a word I say.
- Well, you make them a bit more believable.
- OK, I will make them a bit more believable.
Just the right time.
He's in the right mood.
Dad, we would like to
talk about something very important.
- What kind of important?
- Look, dad.
- Here, sit down.  - Sit down?
- Yes, dad, sit down.
- Ok, I sit down. What's up?
- Mum, we thought about this long and hard...
- Yeah?
- And we came to a decision.
- What is your decision? Tell me.
- Well, dad...
- We really love our siblings.
- Of course, people love their siblings.
We don't want to live apart from them.
- I'm suddenly tired. Good night.
- Good night.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
- So?
- We should all be together, dad.
Wouldn't I want you all to be together?
Being away from 3 of my kids all
these years, do you think it was easy?
But that bastard won't leave your siblings alone.
And we don't even know if they
would want to come and live with us.
Your siblings would come but that witch
woman wouldn't leave your siblings alone.
But dad, a family is supposed to be together.
Don't I know this?
Of course a family is supposed to be together.
But what to do? That immoral, bastard
dad of yours has put us in this situation.
- I wish he goes to hell.
- Stop, mum. Maybe there is a way.
So, what's the way?
If you say our mum won't let our siblings go,
you wouldn't let us go either.
Of course I wouldn't.
So we say, how about you
two get back together?
What?! Getting back together with that man?
Do you hear what you're saying?
- I think I am going to faint.
- Sit down, mum.
He's an awful, awful man.
He would eat your skin alive.
God save us. No way! That woman
would poison a man like a snake would.
I'd have a stroke in three days
or I'd end up being a murderer.
Dad, do it for us.
For you, I'd eat a chicken raw, but
I wouldn't eat her.
People like him wouldn't change. He
wouldn't be normal even at 100 years of age.
Look, mum, think about us too. You don't
have the right to leave six of your kids sad.
- I want my dad.
- They want their mum too.
- Of course they do.
- Please, just talk to him once.
Maybe you'll get along this time.
OK, I'll talk to him once, just for you.
Ask him to come here to my place.
Definitely not! I'd rather be dead
than going to her place.
She should come to my place!
- I won't go! She'll come and that's that!
- Stop, mum, there is an easier way.
He doesn't have to come to you
and you don't have to go to him.
- We should meet in an impartial place.
- Right in between Samatya and Sariyer.
Ok, that'll do.
But hear me out, I am only going to see
that ghastly man's face because you wanted me to.
- Good night.
- You too, dad.
Oh my god it wasn't easy.
- God damn you all!
- What's wrong, Uncle?
What's wrong? If they figure out that
I have been seeing both of them separately...
...they'll kill me.
We were living happily.
Why did you have to bring
these two crazy people back together?
Dad, she's a woman after all.
Be gentle with her, OK?
Listen to yourself? Am I a caveman?
I am always a gentleman.
Mum please be calm.
Don't get angry.
Are you crazy? Why should I get angry?
I don't care about him.
Besides, do I look angry, hmm?
- Come on, kids. Let's go and have a seat.
- Sure.
Let's go.
- You shall sit down.
- I shall sit down.
- You shall sit down too.
- I shall sit down too.
- You look good.
- So do you.
I see you've got a bit of a belly now,
Miss Saadet.
And I see your hair has turned all white.
You look like an old man, Mr. Kazim.
- Why did you call me here?
- Who? The kids forced me to.
They have a wish.
- Yes. They'd like to be together.
- Isn't it their right to be together?
- Of course it is. We need to sort this out.
- Right.
Good good.
I have an offer for you.
- Don't upset me this time, Miss Saadet.
- I won't of course.
- This is about my kids after all.
- Well done.
I'd expect you to behave like this.
>- Yeah, we are grown ups after all.
<- God save you.
So you won't upset me?
Why would I? You're the father
of all 6 of my kids after all.
Well done to you!
So, let all the kids
live at my place together.
What did you say? How can
I break up with my kids?
Mum!
Shush!
Look at him! He doesn't
even know what he's talking about!
- Look at me, Miss Saadet.
- You look at me, Crazy Kazim.
You sinister bitch! When are
you going to act properly?
<- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Dad!
Shush!
<- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Aren't you ashamed in front of your kids?
- You don't even appreciate a goodwill, bitch!
- Bitch is your dad! Get the hell away from me!
- Watch your mouth or else...
- Or else what? You bastard, vile dog!
- Vile bitch! You shameless woman!
- You are shameless.
- You indecent woman!
- You are indecent!
- You are such a shameless woman!
- You are shameless!
- Shameless! Filthy bitch, filthy!
- You are filthy!
You bastardly pig!
Go to hell!
God damn you, bitch!
I am going to kill you!
It's my fault after all.
If you listen to your kids,
this is what you get!
"Blind leading the blind."
Such a great saying!
- But, dad, is it wrong to ask for a mum?
- It is!
You ungrateful bastards.
Haven't I been mum to you all?
You have, but it is different
to have a woman in the house, dad.
Is that so? So you want
a woman in the house, do you?
Yes!
- A woman?
- Yes!
Hang on then.
Miss Sidika! Miss Sidika!
- Yes, Mr. Kazim?
- Come here!
- You say I need a woman, right?
- Yes.
Very well then. Will you marry me?
- Are you serious? Of course I will.
- Good, get ready then!
- I am already ready!
- There you have it.
Nilgun! Nilgun!
<- Nilgun! Nilgun! Nilgun!
- Mum, you scared the shit out of me! What's up?
- Great news, girl, great news!
- There is a wedding!
- Oh, really?!
- Has Ziya finally asked for your permission?
- No, Mr. Kazim has asked for me. What do you say?
Come here, dude. Oh my God.
- Miss Saadet, what's wrong with you?
- Get in here, I will explain!
- Come here! Oh my God!
- Oh my God!
<- Walk, Mr. Nazif!
I said walk, Mr. Nazif!
<- Don't pull me, stop!
<- I am not pulling you, walk!
There. Since you all want a father,
here is a father to you!
- Miss Saadet? What the hell is going on?
- Monsieur, don't you want me?
- Yes.
- Well I am all yours now. Happy?
<- Yeah!
<- There. Say hello to your father!
What's up?
Where are you all coming from?
Bad news, dad!
Has something happened to your siblings?
Yes, dad!
What! Accident? Which one?
Three of them!
- Oh my God! Are they dead?
- No, dad!
They are all alive!
And there hasn't been any accident.
- But they are in tears!
- Why is that?
Our mum is getting married
to a drunk person.
I think he has already
beaten up our little brother.
What the hell is this bitch doing?
Step dad to my kids?
I'll sort this out!
I'll show her!
What are you doing here?
I didn't come to you.
I am here for my kids.
What happened to my kids?
I hear you are getting married. At this age?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, woman?
What's wrong? And what's it
up to you anyway? Are you jealous?
Jealous of you? Let me have a laugh!
Look at me! I will not let my kids
to have a step dad, understood?
You cannot do anything.
I am not asking you!
- And I hear the guy is a drunk?
- You hear wrong!
He's not drunk. And he is a gentleman.
And he is younger than you!
Fuck his youth!
I say no way!
And I say yes! Anything else?
Look at me, Saadet. If you ever get married,
I will show you then.
What are you going to do?!
You'll see what I am going to do then!
You will see! You will see!
- I will show you, you bitch!
- Stinky pig! Get the hell out of here!
I've had enough of this man!
Tell me guys, what's wrong?
I am going mad!
Nothing.
I'm going to die! Obviously something
bad has happened. Tell me!
You don't want to know what happened
to our brothers, mum!
Oh my God! Are they ill?
Have they been in an accident?
It's worse! My dad is getting married!
Married?
And with such a cheap woman!
Omer says "if I have a step mother,
I will kill myself."
Don't be sad.
Your mother is still alive!
As long as I am alive, that pig will not
be able to bring a step mother to my kids.
Get ready. We are going!
Is that you? Come in.
- Oh, did you come too?
- Yes, I came too.
See?!
Come in then.
- Hello kids!
- Welcome, mum!
I am not going to stay long.
I have a couple of things to say to you.
No issues. As long as you don't cause a scene!
A scene?! I don't like having fights.
I'm going to tell you nicely.
I hear you are going to bring...
...a step mother to my kids.
- And what's it to you?
What do you mean what's it to me?
These are my kids!
You can't bring a stranger
to look after my kids!
Are you jealous?
As if!
Why would I be jealous of
that cheap woman?!
>- I don't even care!
Her and I play in different leagues.
>- What did you think?!
Kids, what are you doing
here at this time of the night?
Ziya?
>- Ziya!
Aunty!
What are you doing
in this pig's home?
Well. Give me a minute, Aunty.
Let me explain.
- Dude, are you seeing this woman?
- Seeing me? He's at mine every single day!
- Ziya, you told me you haven't seen her at all?
- You said you wouldn't even look at his face?
God damn you!
Get the hell out of my house!
- Don't let me ever see you ever again!
- If you say so!
- I'll go to my Aunt, then.
- Get off!
I don't want to see you.
I am not your Aunty anymore!
- I am going then.
- Get out! Get out!
Where should I go?
You ungrateful bastard!
- You liar!
- You cheater!
Forget about that Ziya. He's your
brother after all. Pot calling the kettle black!
Let's cut it short. You cannot
bring that bitch to this house!
- I will and nobody can say a word!
- If he steps her foot into this house...
...I will kill that whore!
My dear Mr. Kazim!
<- I am here.
I made you stuffed vine leaves.
Do you have a visitor?
I am not a visitor, lady.
I am the mother of my kids.
Is that so? So you are the mother?
Didn't you like it, darling?!
I am Mr. Kazim's fiancé!
- Is that so?
- Didn't you like it?
Oh my God, Mr. Kazim. Is this the
"young" lady you were talking about?
- She's gone mouldy all over.
- What kind of a bitch is this woman?
What kind of a woman are you, madam?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself by 
getting hooked up to a man with 6 kids?
- Look at me...
- This is enough. Hold this pot!
- I am going to show this woman!
- You watch your words, whore!
Are you calling me a whore?!
Shut your mouth, you midget!
- Are you calling me a midget?
- Yes, I am calling you a midget!
- She's calling me a midget. Say it again.
- I'll say it ten times if you like!
You fucking whore!
- You bitch!
>- God damn you bitch!
Get off me!
I am going to eat this woman!
I'll eat your entire family!
- Who do you think you are?
- Fuck off, you whore!
<- You mouldy bitch! Mouldy!
- You cheap whore!
What's up Ziya?
At this time of the night?
- Don't ask, my darling. I'm now on the streets.
- On the streets? Why?
I said "I love Nilgun and I am going to
marry her." to that so called brother of mine.
- Then he talked against you.
- Really?
Then I yelled "Nobody can
talk about her like that."
- Then he kicked me out.
- My brave darling!
So, what's going to happen now?
I can stay at yours for a few days.
No! My mum will never let you!
- Don't tell your mum!
- No way!
- Yes!
- No!
- Yes!
- No!
Get in!
OK, come.
- You'll stay here.
- Don't you have your room?
My room is after the wedding!
Get in. My mum will kill me
if she sees you!
Stop, don't go right away!
Let me smell you for a bit!
- After the wedding!
- Fuck the wedding!
Come here, girl!
Oh, Nilgun. I'm burning!
No, Ugur! How can we get married?
You're thinking of childish things.
Why not?
Because I am the daughter
of an ordinary pickle salesman.
And I am employed by your father.
Will your father accept me?
Why not? He used to be
a worker back in the days!
He's proud of this fact.
Can't stop talking about it.
- That's different.
- Besides, let me handle him.
Give me your answer.
I love you so very much.
Will you marry me?
Yes or no?
Yes, darling.
My daughter, stop crying.
You are hurting yourself.
Besides, what's wrong about it?
You should be happy now.
Mum, they are coming here
to ask for your blessing tomorrow night.
It's good, isn't it?
How many times have I told you?
I lied to him.
I said I have a mother and father.
I didn't tell him you two are divorced.
What's wrong with being divorced?
We didn't kill anyone, did we?
Mum, there is no way
you can understand this.
Children are usually ashamed of
their parents being divorced.
Because of this, they usually hide this from their friends.
I still don't get it but we'll find
a way. There's always a way.
Am I coming to yours tomorrow?
Why is that?
I told you, they are coming to ask for your
blessing and they don't know you are divorced.
Zeynep, are you sure this isn't another...
...game to bring your so called mother
of yours and I back together again?
No, dad, this isn't a game.
You haven't been my father for years.
Don't make the role of being my father
for one night a big deal.
- Role? I am your father, girl!
- Yes, maybe for you, but...
...your children don't think the same way.
Besides, it's not the time to argue about this.
It's about my happiness.
- Are you coming?
- OK.
Just for you, I will put up with
going to that house one more time.
But tell this to the so called mother
of yours that she shouldn't embarrass us.
- You be careful too, OK?
- Sure.
My dad and brothers are coming, mum.
Please keep it calm this evening, will you?
- Tell this to your so called father.
- Come on in.
- Welcome, dad.
- Thank you.
I'm here just because of you.
- Welcome dad.
- Thank you.
- Welcome dad.
- Thank you.
Come on in.
- Mother!
- My darling kids!
- Let me kiss, mother.
- My chubby one.
- Let me kiss.
>- My darling!
My dear kids. Have a seat.
Come, dad.
Sit here together.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Behave!
- Get away!
They are here.
Welcome, come in.
Go!
- Let me take your coat, madam.
- Thank you darling.
My mum, my dad,
and these are my brothers.
- Welcome, lady.
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Come in, sir.
Come in!
- Hello kids!
- Welcome!
The lad is quite cool, kids.
Have a seat, please.
Son, have a seat too.
- You didn't have to do all of this.
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't worry about it.
Let me kiss, sir.
- Let me kiss.
- Thank you.
Welcome.
- So, are we all good?
- Thanks to God.
- The weather has been good nowadays.
- Hasn't it?
- I hope you don't mind the mess.
- Oh please, don't worry about it.
What to do, 6 kids, and us,
trying to get by every day.
<- This is life after all!
- As long as you are all happy.
- Right.
You never know when the kids are
going to leave the nest. One day you wake up...
...and they are all gone. Then you see...
...you are all alone by yourself.
- Well said, sir.
- How do you take your coffees?
- With a little bit of sugar.
What's happening?
What's that noise?
- Uncle!
- Got busted!
Aunty. Aunty, please save me!
I am begging you!
I am no longer your Aunty.
Get the hell out of my house!
My Aunty. My dear Aunty,
you don't know what happened!
Bro, what are you doing in this house?
<- Tell me, why are you here?
- Ziya, don't be silly and get out!
Come, mother, I am sure
he's hiding here right now!
- Ziya, Ziya, Ziya!
- Damn! They are here!
<- Ziya!
- If you excuse me.
<- Where the hell is that man? Where the hell
is he! Show me where he is.
Where is the womaniser?
Where is that womaniser?
<- Look at me, woman.
What are you doing in my house?
I am looking for my honour,
lady, my honour!
That rapist called Ziya came to my house
and tarnished my daughter's name!
Where is he?
Where is he?
<- Answer me, woman?
You can't answer me, right?
<- Of course you can't.
Watch what's going to happen now.
I'll deal with you later.
Oh my God, Mr. Kazim!
What are you doing in this house?
Just before we get married?
- Sorry? Who's marrying who?
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
Miss Sidika, we'll talk about this later.
Why are you blinking your eye?
Aren't you my fiancé?
- Sorry, she is a bit crazy.
- You are crazy, you mouldy bitch!
As soon as you realised you are
losing him, you took him in, right?
- Watch your words or else...
- Shut up, bitch!
- Bitch! Who do you think you are hitting?
- I am hitting you, so what?
Sorry, sir!
<- Bitch!
<- Your family is a bitch!
- Fuck off!
- Get off me!
So what? Whore! Whore!
<- Watch your mouth!
You are whore, bitch!
And she's talking about honour!
Get off me!
Oh my god. I am not feeling well.
- I am going to kill that bitch!
- Fuck off! Who do you think you are killing?
Your family is a whore!
Mum, he's here!
Bastard, rapist, pig!
Oh, the door is open waiting for me.
Bitch, you will never cross
our street ever again!
- There's a party going on here.
- I am going to kill you.
- Who is going to kill who?
- Oh god, where the hell he's come from?
- Who are you, dude?
- What do you mean who am I?
- I am this woman's fiancé.
- Fiancé?
- Yes, fiancé.
- Don't be silly, man!
<- I said get out!
You stink like shit!
Zeynep, what's this all about?
<- Don't talk much.
- I am telling you to leave!
You leave! This is my house now!
- Don't make me angry...
- Hello, sir.
- Get the fuck out of here!
- You get out of my fiancé's house!
- It's not polite, sirs. You are all grown ups.
- Get the hell out of here you son of a bitch!
- You are the son of a bitch!
- It's not polite, sirs, don't.
To me? To me?
- And now this.
- Why? The kids are right.
- They want to be smacked.
- What's up? Are they workers?
<- No, son, read the signs.
<- If their parents don't get back together,
they are going to starve to death.
What a great start in the morning, isn't it?
They think they are mad at me,
they went to their mother's.
I don't even care.
I'll eat my food then.
I won't love the bastards
who don't love me.
Of course, they went to their father!
I don't want the kids who don't want me.
They can live with their father
as long as they like.
- Aren't you ashamed of stealing my kids?
<- Huh?!
Come on, give me my kids back!
Children, where are you?
- What are you talking about?
Aren't they with you?  - No!
They are not here either.
Oh my God. What if
something happened to them?
- All 6 of them?
- How would I know?
Come on, let's go and look for them.
- Let's go.
<- Oh my God!
Oh God!
- Are you cold?
- Hungry.
- I wonder what they have been up to this evening.
- They must be worried like hell.
As long as they sort their act out.
Pastries! Fresh, crispy pastries!
Cookies, pastries! Crispy pastries!
We'll starve to death by the time my
mum and dad sort their act out.
This strike will be good for you.
You'll lose weight and join the army.
- If I don't die by then.
- If you are going to give up on day one...
... you can go now.
- Are you crazy?
Can't you even handle a joke?
As long as I have this tummy,
I'll survive longer than all of you.
- What are you thinking?
- Mum and dad.
I wonder what they are doing right now.
My feet hurts.
Have we looked everywhere?
Of course we have.
Police stations, hospitals...
- We only didn't look at the loony bin.
- Stop mocking about. I am dying here.
- You heartless man!
- I am not dancing around, am I?
We asked everywhere. At least
there is no bad news, thank God.
The door! I think they are here.
- Aunty, are you here too?
- Don't call me Aunty.
- How can you still come to this house?
- OK. Wait a minute.
- Get the hell out of this house.
- Wait a minute. Wait, bro! Wait!
I found the kids, bro!
- What?
- The kids?
Oh my God! Are they alright?
Read it, read it!
<- Look.
- Six boys are doing hunger strike.
- Oh my God.
If their parents don't get back together,
the kids are determined to die of hunger.
- So you're sure about this?
- Yes.
Unless they are back together and we all
live in the same house, we will continue.
- And you will sit hungry until the end?
- Yes.
- So you are ready to die.
- Yes.
- Are you too?
- Yes.
We will never go back from our cause.
This should be a lesson to all the
mothers and fathers out there.
They should think about their kids
before destroying their families.
Mother is in one place, dad
is on another. This is not a family.
- Weren't they good to you guys?
- They were very good to us.
Our tummies were full
but our hearts were empty.
We always wished for a
happy, an ordinary family.
We don't want to wish for it anymore.
They either come, or this is it.
There can't be a home
without a father and a mother.
Sis, mum and dad are here.
- Do you have anything to say?
- I will give you a brief later on. Go now.
<- These are their parents!
<- They are finally here.
<- They've been separate for the past 12 years.
<- After six kids.
<- It's obvious how evil they are.
<- I feel terrible just by looking at them.
- Kids! What's wrong with you?
- Come on kids, come back to home.
- We won't, mother.
- Sure, what do you want to do?
- Everybody knows about it, dad.
- We want both of you to forgive each other...
...and live together.
- Understood, dad?
We'll talk about this later.
You will freeze to death. Let's go home.
- You'll starve to death.
- We are ready for it, mother.
- It's your decision now.
- Decide what?
- To get married?
- What? You mean just because you want it...
...I am going to take this ghastly woman back?
- Don't worry, I am not dying for it.
God forbid!
I'd rather see you all starve to death
instead of getting back to this witch.
I hope you die!
You are not the only man left!
- Shut up, you bitch!
- You bastard!
Enough! Shut up!
You either obey our rules or leave.
- I will never do such thing. I am leaving.
- Do whatever you like.
Ziya!
- What?
- Walk!
Get out of here.
There isn't a circus here.
Get away, dude, get away.
God damn it.
God damn you!
- Walk, bro!
- Oh God.
Carter is going to pass the proposal...
...about Cyprus and then decide about...
...the next steps.
And now, we are going to watch...
...something that took Istanbul and the...
...rest of the country by storm.
6 kids are on hunger strike.
Yes. We are sure. We are
prepared to die instead of going back.
If something happens to us,
our mother and father are responsible.
- Look. Isn't this your girl?
- Yes, dad.
The smell of food are going towards the kids.
- Maybe they'll give up if they smell the food.
- They are so determined, they will not stop.
Yasar, what are you doing?
Behave yourself.
Is it forbidden to smell the food?
Hello.
- Zeynep?
- Ugur, you shouldn't have come here.
Why?
I am joining the strike too.
This is about our family, not your business.
Please, go back to your home.
How can I leave you like this?
I love you, Zeynep.
Me too...
But please leave now.
I will not go anywhere.
If you don't accept me in your group...
...I'll strike here then.
Aunty!
Look who's here.
Nobody has come to my place.
Has anybody come here?
No, but I don't think they will
put up with the rain any longer.
Why don't you come in, Aunty?
You are wet. Come in.
- Let her come.
- I shall come in, then.
Come in. Come in.
- Oh dear oh dear.
- Oh dear oh dear.
- You have kids, you have troubles.
- But they are sweet troubles.
What's sweet about this, Mr. Kazim?
We were almost going to die.
True.
Sorry, I forgot to ask.
Are you hungry?
Me? While my kids are hungry?
You're right, but it's their fault.
They are still kids.
You are the one who is faulty.
I think I am faulty a bit too.
The truth is, we both are faulty.
We made them go through hell.
I think so.
What happened has happened.
What was the thing you and I
were fighting about?
Did you forget it? We had an argument
about pickle juice.
Really?
Is that why we got divorced?
What else did you think?
What else was wrong in our lives?
Miss Saadet, both of
us behaved so childish.
True. And then we say
we love our children.
You're right.
We are not a true mother and father.
Look who's here.
Kids, you win! We give up.
Come back to your home.
Let's agree on it first.
You are going to get married, right?
- Yes, we will.
- Yes, we will.
- Oh my god look at the crowd.
- I'm ashamed of myself for doing this at this age.
- If you listen to your kids, this is what happens.
- So what? You wanted...
...to dress up.
- Don't push or I will change my mind.
- I already have.
I think they are having a fight again.
- What if they change their mind?
- It would be so disgraceful.
Since all your papers are ready,
in front of these witnesses...
...I am going to ask both of you.
Miss Saadet, the daughter of Hasan.
Do you accept Mr. Kazim as
your lawfully wedded husband?
I am asking you, Miss Saadet.
- Yes.
- Oh!
You? Do you accept Miss Saadet
to be your lawfully wedded wife?
So...
So... Yes.
And I pronounce you husband and wife
on behalf of the Mayor of Istanbul.
Bravo!
<- Press on his foot, mum.
His feet!
- Why are you pressing on my feet?
- I do whatever I want.
- I am so tired, I am really tired.
- Are you happy now?
- Did we do all you asked us to do?
- Not yet.
- Why?
- You are going to go into the nuptial chamber.
- This is the tradition.
- No way. Don't be silly.
Come on, Zeynep.
Take the bride to her room.
- Come on, mother, come with me.
- Are you guys crazy?
What the hell are you talking about, kids?
- Mum, quick!
- Girl, are you crazy?
Where the hell has this
nuptial chamber idea came from?
- Come on, mum!
- Come on, dad!
<- I've never seen such thing. Please don't.
- Girl, stop pushing me.
- Get in now.
- Oh my God! They bought new sheets!
At this age, it doesn't make any sense!
- Be quick!
- You are making me feel embarrassed.
- Finally it's done.
- I still can't believe it.
- We got blood out of a stone.
- I was so worried that it was...
...going to fail in the last minute.
- Come on, kids. We should go to bed.
Let's go to sleep.
>- Why did you lock the door?
>- It's none of your business.
>- Don't be rude.
>- You don't be rude. I asked you...
...why you locked the door.
Are you deaf? Huh?
<- Oh my god. They started again!
Mum! Dad! Don't!
>- You shameless woman!
>- You are a shameless, rude man!
What's up kids? What are you doing
in the nuptial chamber?
Weren't you fighting?
What fight? We were just joking around.
We could be childish...
...we could be crazy, we could be stubborn,
but we are not fools.
Getting back together after all these years,
we will not be separated by a...
...pickle jar, let alone pickle juice.
