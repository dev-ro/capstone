- Morning.
- Name please.
Yes, uh, Anna and Frank Fogle.
Fogle.
- Fogle!
- Yes.
We're ready for an inmate. Nobody move.
We've got some equipment
coming in, gate A.
It just says Anna Fogle.
Keep your shoes on at all times.
Do not remove
any jewelry while...
Ma'am, no head gear.
Do not remove any jewelry
while you're inside.
No electronic devices.
No baggy pants.
- Hey.
- Sean.
Hey, no touching.
It's good to see you.
I've come to say
goodbye, Seanie.
Don't let the past control you.
Be kind to yourself, Sean.
Murderers make your
best inmates.
They're smarter,
they know how to behave.
What about thieves?
Your common thief,
he's the worst.
Don't want to listen,
don't want to work.
Zero respect for the rules.
Well how about when
they get out?
I was reading somewhere that
87% end up back in prison.
Well, the key is reintegration.
Best way to stay out
is to find a good job.
Shouldn't be too
hard, should it?
It's next to impossible.
Oh.
Oh, well, thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- Take care.
Hey, how's he doing?
Thanks so much.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Frank.
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

Complements of

What am I suppose
to do with $20?
Send the governor some flowers?
You can get changed
in C1, good luck.
Don't come back, son.
- Come sign here.
- There.
You got a
shot to roll on box number two.
Open the gates.
Who's that?
It's nobody.
Morning.
Hey, I brought you some donuts.
Here's, uh, some of
your old clothes.
Well, you could've just
said, "No, thank you."
- What are you doing here, Frank?
- Coming to get you.
- No, thank you.
- Listen...
- Sir.
- I'm his father.
- You, you want to go with your dad?
- No.
Can't force him
if he don't want to.
Excuse us.
It's for Mom, we have
to do something for her.
What did she want?
Well, near the end...
she, uh, made me promise
that you and I, together,
would take trip and
spread her ashes over a lake.
- What lake?
- Lake Olling, it's back east.
Back east, why?
- Well...
- Where?
- New York, Massachusetts?
- No, no, further east.
Further fucking east.
Why would Mom want to
be buried in Ireland anyway?
I don't know, she was dying,
she could barely breathe.
Some things you don't
question, you just do.
No, you don't question,
you just do.
Listen, if we do this, you'll
never have to see me again.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
I've got to be in California in five days.
That's plenty of time. It's an eight hour flight
and then just a few hours drive to the lake.
All in the wrong direction.
Besides, isn't flying one of
your phobias or some shit?
You see, we're all
making sacrifices.
I've carefully planned this.
It'll take three and a half days.
After that, I'll pay your
airfare wherever you want to go.
Not interested, do it yourself.
No, no, it has to be both of us.
She was very insistent.
But, look, while we're there,
we could take a look at
the house that she left there.
- What house?
- An old family place she inherited.
- How much is it worth?
- I don't know, I didn't even know she had it.
But if you come with me,
whatever it is, it's all yours.
Sounds like a good deal, Fogle.
Then you fucking go.
Wait, Sean.
Sean, Sean, it was her
dying wish, I promised.
Shouldn't make promises
you can't keep, Frank.
- Is there...
- Okay, sir, you need to step back.
Last three years
as a tour bus driver,
you're overqualified,
I just need somebody
drive a car to L.A.
I can't wait to get started.
Now most people, they want a return
ticket, how come you don't?
Um, I'm actually relocating
to the West Coast
for a job, so.
Oh, works out well for everyone.
I need a reference or two.
Yeah, yeah, sure,
of course, um...
second, yes, so I have
their phone numbers here,
if you have any, uh,
further questions.
Great, great.
How about someone local,
like from Evansville.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Um, you
know, uh, a few names, actually,
a few names come to mind, but I believe
they are out of town at the present.
Where, son?
Uh, I, I think one's
on vacation and the other, uh...
No, no, no, no, you.
Look, I'm ,
I really need to get to
California by Monday.
Limestone, Decatur?
Limestone.
What for?
Look, how about, how about
you just give me gas money,
and we forget about
the meals and lodging per diem.
I make one phone call
and find out.
Auto theft.
I have five days to
get to Oakland.
Well, then we better get moving.
- When's my return?
- Sunday morning, 10:50.
- Ah, shoot.
- What?
I told them plain.
Take it back.
It's fine.
It's not fine, it's not
what you ordered.
There.
Now it is.
Damn, get some balls. Go back there and
tell the 16 year-old behind the counter,
"You fucked up my order."
Yeah. I never talked
to my father that way.
Your father... would've been
too drunk to understand.
Let's just have a nice meal.
Come on...
you can say it, you can
do it, the guy was a dick.
All right, he was a dick.
He was my father.
I respected him.
You have to earn respect.
I disagree.
You respect me,
because I'm your son?
Can't we just have a nice meal?
You don't respect me.
Come on, why don't you
just admit things?
It's not like it's going to
ruin our relationship, Frank.
- I've done the best I could given the circumstances.
- Um.
Sometimes you're the pigeon,
sometimes you're the statue, that's life.
You brush off your
shoulders and you move on.
I've moved on.
You know, they say it's inevitable
that you turn into your father.
I don't think that'll
ever happen.
Yeah, well, if it does...
Well, here we go.
About to dangle 30,000 feet
above the ocean
in a tin can, operated
by somebody
who probably hasn't
had enough sleep.
Hey, anytime you want to bail,
- change my ticket back to Oakland...
- No, I'll be fine,
I'll be fine, maybe we
can watch a movie.
Please have your passports ready
for inspection at the passport facility.
Four-door, air conditioning,
manual transmission...
Oh, ma'am, excuse me, aren't all the
cars automatics? I can't drive a stick.
Oh, no, actually, over here,
that's a special request,
- and at the moment we have no automatics in your car class.
- Oh.
- You'd have to upgrade?
- It's fine, we'll take the stick, I will drive.
I will take the upgrade.
Would you like
to take the fuel option,
so you don't need
to fill your tank?
Oh, no, we'll be stopping
every hour or so,
helps break up a long drive.
It's the dumbest shit I've ever
heard. It'll take twice as long.
It'll take longer
if we run out of gas.
A little obvious,
don't you think?
- What?
- The way you were staring at her chest?
Oh, I was not.
Little respect wouldn't hurt
you in the lady department.
Oh, the lady department,
where's that?
Is that, is that next to
housewares? Is that aisle seven?
You have to show respect
to get respect.
I should know, been in
sales all my life.
You're about to give me
lady advice, aren't you?
Open the door for them,
give them your jacket...
hold their purse.
You should take notes
for when you're selling
stolen cars in California.
Hey, what are you doing?
What, what? No.
All right, move over.
Oh, now look what you did.
Anyway, for the record, that is not
how you go about winning any hearts.
I do just fine...
Winning hearts.
Thank you very much.
I do look forward to when
you teach me about sex.
Yeah, now that we passed
the snail lady,
looks like we're going to
get to that house... by tonight.
Tomorrow.
Tonight we have to stop
in Dublin for that thing.
Thing, what fucking thing?
That dinner thing for your mom
with a couple of her relatives.
Oh, fuck that, I don't
even know those people.
We have to. They couldn't come
over for the funeral,
and they wanted to
get together here.
Who's the fucking genius who told
them that we're coming to Ireland?
What's wrong?
Well, I'm modest, is that okay?
Your suit's in the bag.
No, no, I'm not wearing this.
That was in high school,
it wasn't even cool back then.
Fine, wear whatever you like.
Get ready here.
You know, I don't think I've
ever seen you without your clothes on.
Hey, why are there two
toilet flushers in here?
I don't know, I've never
been to this country before.
Got it, big one's
for number two.
Okay.
So we stumble out,
completely ossified,
barely able to crawl
to the next pub.
12 years later, and I'm
still nursing the hangover.
Mind you, we were in our 40s at the time.
I didn't know about that one.
She was one of the kindest
children I ever taught.
I was playing games with
some of the local kids,
saw her having her lunch with
the ones who were left out.
She had a real soft spot
for the misfits in life.
Frank.
Yes.
Frank, Frank.

Never the first to leave
a party, was she?
We didn't really go
to many parties.
I must've told her
the same ole jokes,
every time I saw her
and she always laughed
like it was the first time.
You don't happen to know
who this is she's with
on the motorcycle?
Not a clue.
No one here, I don't think.
Just another admirer
from long ago, I suppose.

I can't quite place him.
Look who I found,
glued to the bar.
The prodigal son.
I haven't seen you since
you were a wee thing,
before the prodigal part.
Kathleen, who's this fellow,
do you remember?
Like a young Marlon Brando.
Almost made it worth having
your ass on a motorcycle
all that way.
All what way?
Ronin.
Ronin, that's right.
Did they go on a trip
together or something?
Mm, you could say that.
He was the one
she ran away with.
Up north, to Donegal, I think.
Didn't she ever mention this?
No, no, I don't think she ever
mentioned it, did she, Frank?
She might have at some point,
I'm trying to remember.
Were they serious?
No, no, no, no,
nothing like that.
She just had a bit
of a wild streak.
Come on, let's bunk it.
I hope we haven't said anything
that was upsetting, Frank.
Oh, not at all.
If you want to know more,
Bridget drove in from Kinvara.
You could always try asking her.
Bridget, no.
No, that's okay.
Doesn't really matter.
That's exactly right.
Bridget.
Yeah?
It's Frank.
Fogle.
Oh.
Do you have a moment?
Ronin Quinn, she met him
when we were in Galway.
We didn't know him very well.
He wasn't a student or anything.
And when her parents told her
to stop seeing him, well,
you know our Anna, she did
have her more adventurous side.
Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.
He was like her little secret,
just for her.
No one else's business.
Where is he now?
His family raised horses
in Connemara,
but I have no idea
if he's still there or not.
And, uh, when she used to
come back here on visits
did they ever?
You can tell me.
Oh, Frank, I'm sure
that wasn't the case.
What are you still doing up?
I jet lagged.
Hey!
Huh?
When you were little
and you, uh,
came over here with Mom
those times...
you're sure she
never mentioned Lake Olling,
or, or anything else?
No, no, she didn't. Look,
I'm tired, I want to go to bed.
Can we just go to bed?
I want to sleep.
Okay, okay.
You know these things might
be a little bit more fun
if you had a drink
once in awhile.
I thought you were tired.
Where you going?
You're back.
I'm what?
I saw you.
I was over there.
I smiled, you smiled back.
I thought you did.
Yeah, maybe I smiled.
Sean, by the way.
Jewel.
Jewel, Jewel.
That's a luxurious name.
So, uh, you staying here tonight,
you staying at the hotel?
Potentially.
You going to buy me a drink?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Hey.
Jameson neat.
- Sure.
- Two, uh, room two one four.
Two one four.
What has you here,
like, in Ireland?
I'm, uh, heading from
Alabama to California
by way of northwestern Ireland.
Wow, so the
scenic route, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
A little real estate transaction
I got to take care of
while I'm here, thank you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
So, um...
you live here, you got
a place in Dublin?
I did, until, um,
this very month.
And now I'm making my escape.
Oh, yeah, well,
escape from what?
A very violent ex-boyfriend.
One who doesn't seem
to think the laws
against domestic abuse
apply to him.
So go ahead, follow that
with a good pickup line.
You know, sometimes...
you're the pigeon,
and sometimes you're the statue.
That's life.
We should probably get
another one of these.
I think we do.
This way.
- Where?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, man, I'm telling
you, this guy,
- fucking likes to stop every hour for gas and a pee.
- Yeah, you told me.
I swear to God, if I was driving,
three hours, we'd get there.
Sure.
Three hours.
Wait, Sean, are you sure
this is your car?
Yep.
- Come on now.
- Oh, wait, the keys are with my dad.
Got it.
We're good.
Ladies first.
I haven't done this
since I was 15.
And that was in a Daihatsu.
I have no fucking idea
what a Daihatsu is but...
...Toyati's going to be real nice.
- What is that?
- Huh?
Bad tattoo?
Oh, no, it was more
like bad grandpa.
Guy used to get mean
after a few drinks,
liked to smoke Dutch Masters.
He burned you?
- Yeah.
- That's fucking brutal.
Oh, it's not a big deal.
Sorry, it's just I'm spinning.
Okay.
- I just need to get some air real quick.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.
Yeah...
that was not my best first date.
It's not my worst.
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.
You know.
I know.
- Is that him?
- Mm-hmm.
All right, you know what to do?
You got this?
Yeah, I think I'll manage.
All right.
- Hello.
- Morning.
This is Jewel, we're giving
her a ride, all right?
I'm sorry, but we can't
pick up hitchhikers.
She's not a fucking hitchhiker. She's not
a hitchhiker, man, I met her last night.
She's, uh, she's going to
that... where you going?
- Narin.
- Narin, Narin, it's right up by the lake.
I'm sorry, miss.
Look, man, she's trying
to get away
from a bad situation, okay?
- We can't.
- Do you know what, it's all right.
I wouldn't pick up
hitchhikers either.
- Wait, just wait a minute.
- No, that's okay.
One second, all right,
just give me,
one, just one second, don't go.
Listen, it's right by
where we're going.
What's the problem?
- Can't.
- So this is what you call respecting women?
Wait, wait, come on.
Are you coming or not?
No.
You don't want to see
your house, fine.
Just slide them in.
Okay.
Let me guess,
you had the radio on
- all night.
- I didn't do shit.
Hey.
- I'm sorry, do you want to lift the bonnet?
- The what?
The, the bonnet,
my dad's a mechanic.
That's all right, miss, I've
got the rental insurance.
Just lift the damn bonnet.
Uh, do, do you want to try it?
It was just a little corrosion on your battery cables.
Have a really safe trip,
and be sure to stop like
every hour or two,
because it just makes
a long journey seem shorter.

the whole time, didn't you?
I never even knew she
had a house over here...
among other things.
I have three days
to get to Oakland.
Three fucking days.
It's a good
location, you know.
Stay on this road
towards Athlone,
and then just follow
the signs for Sligo,
it'll take us up there.
Have you been to
the area before, Mr. Fogle?
Oh, no, miss, I haven't.
Mom was there though,
wasn't she?
So what is this anyway,
like a little father
and son fishing trip?
Oh, we kind of skipped over all the
things that started with father son.
His bail.
Sorry, can you repeat that,
couldn't hear you.
Oh, I said, "Unless you
count posting bail."
Posting
bail, all right.
I was like, 15,
my friends and I,
we took his car out for a
spin, he called the cops,
reported it stolen.
Cops got us in two minutes.
Threw us in jail, everyone's
dads came within the hour.
This guy, 24 hours.
His mother was in
the hospital again,
I was dealing with that,
trying to deal with him.
That's right, that's right,
I'm the cause
of my father's
nervous breakdowns.
Well, I don't mean,
I'm sorry, I, I didn't...
It wasn't a nervous breakdown.
I was doing the best I could
during a very difficult time,
but my son couldn't grasp that.
He wanted Clark Kent
for a father.
Uh, had Clark Kent,
wanted Superman.
Well, and we just
wanted a good son.
But, instead of watching
him play baseball
we get to visit him in jail.
Criminal mischief,
vehicle theft, arson.
- Because that...
- Arson, arson, huh, you want to talk about arson?
Remember I told you how grandpa used
to use my shoulder as an ashtray?
Guess who just stood there
and watched it happen?
That's not true, I had no idea.
He hadn't a drink in years.
Own it like that.
What kind of father
just does nothing?
I couldn't see anything.
I saw you, you just
walked by, pretended like
you didn't see shit.
- I couldn't see anything.
- Bullshit.
Look, I, I wasn't in
my right mind at the time.
- You still could've done something.
- I couldn't!
Hey, it's okay.
Yeah, fuck him.
Where the fuck
are you going?
Why are you turning here?
Leave the keys, we want
to listen to the radio.
Or not.
So, what's so
important in Oakland, huh?
What's the rush?
I got a job in
an electronics warehouse.
- Seriously?
- Seriously, real job, real paycheck.
Somebody else gets it
if I'm not there by Monday.
And what, you couldn't
just find another job?
It's not that easy.
You want to know the main reason
why people end up back in prison?
They commit more crimes?
They can't get a job.
I'm not going back.
You're the first person in as
long as I can remember that...
I like talking to.
Really makes me want
to talk to you.
Sir, can I help you?
Oh, hello.
Hello.
I knocked at the house
but there was no answer.
Yep.
Are you Ronin?
Sorry, who are you?
I'm Frank.
Anna was my wife.
Um, no, Ronin was my brother.
He, uh, he passed away
over 30 years ago now.
Oh?
This is your wife?
Yes.
Here, let me show you something.
1963 Triumph Thunderbird.
Took me ages to find
all the parts.
After Ronin died I just started,
pieced it back together again.
Don't know why, really.
Did he ever mention
my wife to you?
Um, no, no, not that
I can recall but...
Well, we weren't really in much
contact back then, that's all.
- Yeah.
- Well, I should let you get back to your horses.
If I could just, uh.
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.
- You take care.
You too.
Will do.
I'm sorry, one more thing.
Yeah?
Where was your brother buried?
He wasn't, he was cremated,
so his ashes could be
spread across some
lake up north.
Hey, Frank.
Frank?
- You all right?
- Yeah, you're getting all wet.
Yeah.
We both are.
Let's go.
You sure
you're all right?

- You're not hungry?
Oh, no, thank you.

What is this?
Oh, uh...
- Your wife?
- Yes.
She's very beautiful.
Where was it taken?
Somewhere on the honeymoon
they took.
A honeymoon with... Mr. Biker?
Yes, before he was
lucky enough to die
in a tragic motorcycle accident.
Jesus Christ,
give it a rest, man.
Yeah, but she married you.
She settled on me.
She never forgot him.
His ashes are already
floating around that lake,
I'm just the delivery boy,
putting them back together.
There's like, 10,000
lakes in Ireland.
You sure it's the same one?
I don't know.
Where did you meet?
Oh, on a bus in Detroit.
She dropped a book
and I picked it up.
I never told her I rode that
bus in the wrong direction
every day for three weeks,
waiting for her to
drop something.
What a fool.
Hey, I'll tell ya this.
We might go on rides
with the rebels...
it's the kind-hearted one
we spend our lives with.

Thanks to our

Hey.
Hearing you sing was...
thank you, you have
a beautiful voice.
Thank you.
You're a very good man, Frank.
That's why she fell for you.
You make a... girl feel

Thank you.

Oh no, not at all.

Goodnight.
Still raining out there?
I think it's going to let up
tomorrow, that'll be great.
Oh, boy.
Where's Mom?
Oh, you didn't, I
thought maybe you we're going to
bring her up, shoot.
You know what, we're getting
a really early start and,
well, it's Ireland so,
I think she'll be okay, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
How's Jewel paying for her room?
She's going to send me a check.
I want my own room,
I'll send you a check.
No, you won't.
She's not sending you a check.
- How do you know?
- She's not going to send you a check.
Did she tell you that?
Just another person walking
all over you.
She's not walking all
over me, it's my choice.
Just another person,
just let another person
just walk right,
just put that down.
Just stop with you're doing for a second,
put down your toothbrush, stand back.
- What, what are you doing?
- Lift up your hands, I'm going to teach you how to fight.
- I don't want to.
- I'm going to teach you how to, no...
It's late, I just want to go to bed.
It's been a long day.
Oh, there you go, look,
your hands are up now.
- What are you doing? No.
- That's good, hey, come on.
Come on, it's fun, right?
- What is this, no, no.
- It's good.
Hang on, listen, listen,
listen, listen,
if this is about Jewel...
What do you mean
about Jewel, huh?
What are you talking about?
Get the fuck up.
Come on. Come on, what are
you going to do?
If I do that, what are
you going to do?
What are you going to do, huh?
- What are you doing?
- Come on, get up.
- Hey, Sean, that's it,
- Come on, hit me.
- What?
- What are you going to do?
If I keep doing that,
you're going to do nothing?
- I saw her in the hallway...
- No, I'm not,
- I'm not...
- Saw her kiss you.
You like that, huh,
you want to fuck her? Want to
get back to Mom
for fucking around?
Leave me alone!
Jesus Christ.
Oh!
I'm sick of this.
And I'm sick of you.
So we're going to get
this over with,
next lake I see, and we're going
to get away from each other.
Hello?
What?
Sean?
What?
Where, where's Jewel?
I don't know.
No, no, no!
- Oh, shit.
- Come on.
What? No. Come on.
God!
Excuse me, Avis is here.
Okay.
No, ma'am, that looks like
a manual transmission.
They were suppose to
send an automatic.
Uh, one moment.
Thank you.
I'm going to need that airline
ticket and bus fare back to Dublin.
You can just ride with me.
What the fuck are you talking
about, you're staying.
No, insurance covers
the rental car.
Who gives a shit about
the rental car, what about Mom?
What about her?
We have to get her back.
Get her back.
How am I going to get her back?
Well.
I got her to Ireland, that's
going to have to be good enough.
I think she deserves
a little bit more respect than,
"I got her to Ireland."
Thought you had to earn respect.
She took care of you for
28 years, I think she earned it.
Maybe you should just
take the bus.
Would you like to take
care of the incidentals now?
What incidentals?
Phone call
from your room?
No, ma'am, we didn't
make any calls.
That's, that's a mistake.
- Um.
- Hey, hey, you mind if I see that?
Where's this number to?
It looks like
Northern Ireland.
Thank you, have a nice day.
Bingo, she called some guy
who fixes cars in Belfast.
So?
Let's go find her.
I thought you had
to be in Oakland.
Why don't you let me worry
about that, all right?
And what, you think this is all
just a big misunderstanding?
That she didn't mean to lie
to you or steal the car?
That deep down, she really, really
loves you? And you're going to ride off
- into the sunset, no, trust me...
- All right, stop, stop.
- Forget about all that, all right? Forget about it.
- It's...
Somebody just stole your car
with your wife's ashes in it.
Doesn't that piss you off?
You coming, or what?
I don't know how
to drive a stick.
This is it.
Could be a chop shop.
What are you doing?
- That's trespassing.
- Yeah, let's go around front,
and ask if they bought any
stolen cars today, how about...
How about we do that, huh?
Come on.
Ow.
- Sean.
- Sh, sh.
Come on, it's a dead end.
All right, all right, hang on.
- Can you see it?
- I can see plates, no car.
All right, just be cool.
Just stay calm, stay calm.
It's okay.
Run, run, run!
Come on, come on!
I'm trying.
Help, I'm stuck!
Ow!
I got you, come on.
Let's go.
All right,
usually you try to unload
a stolen car as soon as possible
unless you're trying
to get somewhere.
Narin, she mentioned Narin.
We'll get a better map, we'll figure
out a good route to get there...
Yeah, I think she might've
been lying.
Not, not about that anyway.
That's the hard part,
trying to figure out if it's
all a lie or just most of it.
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you something for your leg.
- You got some money?
- It's fine.
Just give me some
money, come on.
Ow, hey!
Don't be such a pussy,
all right?
You find Narin?
North.
Yeah, this is it.
Good spot.
All right, let's split up.
You go that way.
All right, we'll cover
more ground.
You guys seen a girl
around here?
Maybe drives an Audi, an A4.
No?
Nobody's seen shit?
- Found anything?
- No, you?
No.
Huh!
That's what your mother
and I were going to get
for the road trip.
The opposite of a motorcycle.
What's the traffic all about?
Oh, ferry, probably.
I'll check it out.
And if I'm not back soon,
come get me, okay?
Hey!
Radio one to head office,
there's a man out of his car.
You going somewhere? No, no, no.
You know, my mom's still
in the back, huh?
I'm so sorry, by the time
I saw her, it was too late.
I was going to send
her back, I promise.
Is that what you want?
Was it always about
a stupid car?
The entire time?
Was any of it...
true, any of it real?
What do you want me to say?
You were in prison
for petty theft...
and I'm no Mother Teresa.
I had to get out of here,
and an opportunity
presented itself.
It was as simple as that,
nothing personal.
"An opportunity presented
itself."
Tell me why you're here.
Why am I here?
You stole my fucking car,
that's why I'm here.
Just live for the moment.
Come with me.
We can pretend like none
of this ever happened.
We can be together on
a boat for a couple days,
and just see where it takes us.
Who and what?
You're a free man.
Just think of it as
an opportunity.
Take care of yourself,
all right?
Hey!
Come back here now, son.
Stop there now.
Hey!
Hey, come back here now.
Ah!
He's on the dock,
he's on the dock.
What are you doing there?
Sean!
Catch.
No, no!
Oh!
Oh!
He's going out!
Come on, come on back.
- Hey, come on back.
- Get back. Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, have
you got him, mate?
Stop, that's my son!
Come on, Sean. Go, go, go, go.
Grab his leg! Drop, drop
that thing, whatever it is.
- Hey, they've gone through.
- Hey, hey.
Both of them's
gone through,
they've both gone through.
- Let's go.
- What do I do?
Clutch.
Clutch.
- Still clear?
- All good.
- Oh, crap.
- Whoa!
Least we got some of her back.
- What's this?
- That's your ticket.
You're all set, you should
get to Oakland just in time.
What about Mom?
Let me worry about that.
Know it probably has
nothing to do with that guy.
Probably not in the same lake.
How's your hand?
- A little sore.
- Yeah, it's going to be sore for the next couple days.
It was a good hit.
Thanks.
I mean, come on, you, you
getting Mom back, that's...
hmm.
I was proud of you.
Going to the airport.
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr. Fogle,
this is your wake-up call.
♪ And all the sweethearts
that e're I had ♪
♪ They'd wish me one
more day to stay ♪
All finished?
Yeah, all finished.
♪ Unto my lot ♪
♪ That I should rise
that you should fall ♪
♪ I'll gently rise
and softly call ♪
Your flight get canceled?
No.
So, are we going to
finish this or what?
One second.
Gosh, darn it.
- Seems far away.
- Yeah.
What's wrong, battery?
Nope, I ran out of gas.
All right, come on, let's go.
Shouldn't be far.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
It's pretty.
It's still off a touch, I think,
I can hear it under the trill.
Hello, may I help you?
Yeah, sorry to interrupt. Uh...
We're looking for Lake Olling.
Any idea if we're in
the right neighborhood?
Yes, but I'm afraid that's
on private property.
Oh uh, well, his mother,
my wife, Anna Fogle,
passed away and she'd asked us
to spread her remains there.
Anna Fogle?
Yeah, this is her.
Ah, yes.
- Anna.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, I'm
so sorry she passed.
Did you know her?
Just from the retreats.
We do spiritual retreats here.
Rent out the rooms
at the convent.
She stayed a number of
times over the years.
Did she never tell you?
- No.
- Well, maybe it was more of a personal thing for her.
Her own little oasis,
that's not uncommon.
She was a lovely woman.
She was indeed.
Whenever she was here,
she'd always take a day,
and spend it in the kitchen.
Sort of her way of contributing.
They would all sit
down that night
and have a lovely meal together.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
The man she's with,
is there any way to know
if his ashes are up
here somewhere?
I'm afraid not, there are
hundreds of lakes up here.
Why do you want to know?
Actually, Lake Olling is the
lake the deer like to cross,
which is quite a sight.
Problem is when it gets foggy,
the deer can't see the other
side, they get confused,
and they keep changing
directions over and over again,
until eventually they drown.
You're very close, it's just over
the hill and around the bend.
Be careful with the fog.

Well, sweetheart... I made it.
We're here.
Being loved by you...
was the greatest gift...
greatest privilege...
of my life.
That and being a father.
Shit.
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else matters.
What are you doing?
Going swimming with your mother.
Woo-hoo!
Hey, you coming or what?
Fuck no, it's probably
freezing in there, man.
It is.
Ah, fuck it.
Oh, fuck.
Woo-hoo!
So what are you
going to do now?
I don't know, maybe
I'll stay here a little bit,
you know, hitchhike, see
where the road takes me.
All this open space looks
really good right now.
I did go back, you know.
To confront your grandfather
after he burned you.
He knew exactly what
I was going to say.
I got halfway into it,
I was really laying into him.
And then he just started
laughing at me.
I didn't know what to do.
So I walked out, drove away...
and I never saw him again.
And neither did you.
So this is what Mom
wanted us to see.
Sure is pretty out here.
It sure is.
