WHEN ANIMALS DREAM
Have you had any other rashes?
No.
And there hasn't been anything else?
Dizziness? Visual impairment?
Anything like that?
No.
Okay.
Please remove your undershirt.
Yes. Let's have a look.
Open up, please.
Thank you.
I just need
to have a look at your gums.
Yes. And you're sure
you haven't had any other symptoms?
Yes.
Please lie down on your stomach.
Yes. It's probably nothing,
but I think -
- I should have another look at you
in a month or so.
- Was that it?
- Yes.
You don't need to make an appointment
with the secretary. I've put it in.
Hi, honey.
- I'm taking mum out now.
- Oh.
Yes, but not for too long.
She's a bit tired today.
Of course.
Here's the last mouthful.
Can you clear the table?
I'll take care of mum, then.
Thanks, honey.
Hi, Marie.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Shall we have a look?
- Yes.
This is where it all happens.
You'll learn this soon enough.
You also have to shovel ice
when needed.
And since you're new you also
have to take out the fish waste.
That's how it's always been. I'll
show you the skip in a bit. Felix?
- Could you help Marie?
- Sure.
- Hi, Felix.
- Hi.
- Can I use these?
- Yes.
Look here.
- Like that.
- Thanks.
- Over there.
- Watch your step, mate.
Esben, cut that out.
Thank you.
He can do that himself.
Welcome aboard, Marie.
Here you go, Marie.
An apron and your own knife.
Welcome.
Hi, honey. You're home early.
Did everything go alright today?
- I cut myself.
- Let me have a look.
It's nothing.
Let's get it checked.
Doctor Larsen's here.
It's okay.
Well...
Mum's not feeling well today.
Her needle marks are swelling up.
- So I called Doctor Larsen.
- Let's have a look.
I've used the other arm
for about a month.
A whole month?
You need to switch to other parts
of her body from time to time -
- when you inject her,
and skip this arm -
- until the swelling goes down.
I thought I did.
And there's no infection?
- No.
- Well, if you say so.
Marie, can you
come downstairs and help?
There.
There, there.
That's it.
Could you give him a hand?
Your name's Marie, right?
- How do you know that?
- I overheard Esben say it.
Esben is an idiot.
He's a massive idiot.
Nice to meet you. Daniel.
Hi, Marie.
Are you angry about
your little swim earlier?
Eh?
Are you mute?
Or are you just slow-witted
like your mum?
What was that?
- Esben dropped his glass.
- Oh?
Well clean it up, then, lad.
Get to it.
Want some?
No thanks.
How's your mother doing?
She's okay.
Come here!
Easy, easy. Easy now.
What the fuck? I think
we've caught a little mermaid.
- Is she a virgin?
- Want a real sailor?
Going down? Come on.
- Down with her!
- No!
Hold her there. Look here.
I have something for you.
Look here.
Look at me.
- This is for you.
- Help!
No one can hear you.
Hold her.
- No!
- Look at it.
And kiss it. Kiss it now.
Yes. Kiss it.
Marie? What's going on in there?
Are you okay?
Sure.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Is that your mum?
Okay.
Daniel.
You look like her.
Can I have my hand back?
We have to get going.
Are you doing anything tonight?
Maybe we could do something.
I can't.
Okay. Perhaps another day, then.
Yeah, perhaps.
What are you doing?
Stop it. Stop that.
What the fuck's
wrong with her anyway?
There, there, baby.
Marie?
Honey.
Honey? What's going on?
All the symptoms are there.
- I hear you.
- I can't keep it a secret for long.
- You haven't told anyone?
- Of course not.
Marie? Could you
come downstairs, please?
Good. Could we
put a pin in that for a little while?
- We have to do something.
- Marie.
- Come take a seat.
- But I'm on my way out.
I called Doctor Larsen
so it'll have to wait. Come here.
Doctor Larsen is... is here
to tell you about your condition.
Marie, the thing is that this has
already begun to change you.
We know from your mother's case
that it's very likely -
- that you'll develop further -
- and much thicker
growth of hair on your body.
And that's not the only thing. There
will also be psychological changes.
You'll become increasingly
quick-tempered and aggressive, -
- so I urgently encourage you
to take this medication.
- I'm not taking any medication.
- Listen to us, Marie.
No, you listen. You can tell him
to shove that shit up his arse, -
- because I'm not taking it.
You get me?
Felix?
- What do you want?
- I need to ask you something.
What's up?
There's an old, rusty cutter
down by the harbour.
Do you know who owns it?
- They were Russians, I think.
- Where are they now?
What do you mean? They're probably
in Russia drinking vodka.
So you don't know
if my mum was ever on that boat?
Okay.
Your mum was beautiful,
but people were also afraid of her.
Just like they're also
afraid of you, Marie.
But that's a whole other thing.
Want to dance?
Hi. Can I have
a rum and coke, please?
A beer for me, please.
I'm turning into a monster.
I have to have so
much sex before that happens.
Is that something
you can help me with?
Faster, Daniel!
Come on.
Great place, man.
You're beautiful.
What's that?
- Marie?
- I'd like you to leave now.
Don't touch me.
You have to leave now.
Hey, what's the matter?
You're beautiful.
You're beautiful.
Come on.
Aren't you ready?
- Dad!
- Easy now, honey.
- Keep the arm outstretched.
- But...
- Calm down. Nothing's wrong.
- Let me go.
- Nothing's wrong.
- Keep it still. Like that.
Come on!
Mum...
Mum, help me.
Sit up straight.
Mum, sit up straight.
Get up.
Sit up straight.
Up.
Just...
Just go to bed.
I'll clean up the rest.
Was that what you did
with the Russians?
They did something to her.
Didn't they?
- And then she killed them.
- Yes.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Doctor Larsen's missing.
- Oh?
- Yes. Have you seen him?
No.
Have you heard anything?
- No, nothing.
- What about your wife?
- She's in her chair here.
- You didn't speak to him yesterday?
No, I think it's been a week
since I last spoke to him.
His wife said
he was coming over here yesterday.
- Oh?
- Are you saying she's lying?
No. No, I'm not saying she's lying.
- She must have misunderstood.
- Thor, we had an agreement.
We still do, but this
has nothing to do with my wife.
So you don't mind us
having a look inside?
Is that really necessary?
- We have to have a proper look.
- Yes.
We have to look at her
without her clothes on.
Can you help me with mum?
- Do you have a grip on her?
- Yes.
The night gown.
Check her nails.
And her gums.
What the fuck
are you laughing about?
Do you think this is a joke?
I'm keeping an eye on you,
too, Marie. You get me?
Mum?
Mum?
Mum?
No! No!
Hey.
I'll take that.
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.
Coffee, dad?
I think you should go home now.
I don't think so.
- Anyone for coffee over here?
- Yes, please.
- He has to get his coffee.
- He has coffee now.
Any coffee over here? Anyone?
Come on.
Don't do that.
Stop!
If you go out like that
I can't help you anymore.
Marie.
No, come here. Marie! Come here!
Marie!
Bye, bye. That was a good day.
Hey! She's over here!
Felix, let me in!
Felix!
Marie? Marie?
Marie, you have to wake up now.
You have to wake up.
You have to get away from here.
They're all looking for you.
What's going on?
Do you remember what happened?
You killed Esben. Lie down.
Hide here and I'll get us a boat.
I'll come back for you
and then we'll sail the fuck away.
How about that?
You're beautiful.
Marie.
Don't take any shit.
Daniel?
- Do we have any rope?
- I'll find some.
What the fuck was that?
Daniel? No!
Daniel? Daniel?
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.
Mayday. Station calling mayday.
This is Lyngby Radio.
This is Lyngby Radio.
What is your position?
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.
Marie!
Marie.
Marie.
- Daniel?
- Yes.
I'm right here.
I'm right here.
