WOMAN: Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings
These are a few
Of my favorite things
DUKE NARRATING: We were
somewhere around Barstow,
on the edge of the desert,
when the drugs
began to take hold.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)
l remember saying
something like...
I feel a bit lightheaded.
(EXCLAIMING)
Maybe you should drive.
(BATS SCREECHING)
DUKE NARRATING: SuddenIy
there was a terrible roar
all around us.
And the sky was full of
what looked like huge bats.
All swooping and screeching
and diving around the car.
And a voice was screaming...
Holy Jesus! What are
these goddamn animals?
(GRUNTING)
(SINGING) Come on, baby
You say something?
Hmm?
Never mind.
It's your turn to drive.
DUKE NARRATING: No point
in mentioning these bats,
l thought.
The poor bastard'll
see them soon enough.
(SINGING) Baby,
l'm starting to feel human
Ohh, ohh, yeah
Hey, hey, feel with me, baby
'Cause l feel it coming on
Fucking pigs! Flying !
All right, let's see.
We had 2 bags of grass,
75 pellets of mescaline,
5 sheets of
high-powered blotter acid,
a salt shaker
half full of cocaine,
a whole galaxy of
multicolored uppers, downers,
screamers, laughers.
Also, a quart of tequila,
a quart of rum,
a case of beer,
a pint of raw ether...
Shit!
2 dozen amyls.
Not that we needed
all that for the trip,
but once you get locked
into a serious
drug collection,
the tendency is to
push it as far as you can.
The only thing
that really worried me
was the ether.
There is nothing
in the world more helpless
and irresponsible
and depraved
than a man in the depths
of an ether binge,
and l knew
we'd get into that
rotten stuff pretty soon.
WOMAN ON RADIO: A House
subcommittee report says,
illegal drugs killed
1 60 American Gls last year,
40 of them in Vietnam.
Drugs...
(SINGING)
One toke over the line
Sweet Jesus
One toke, man !
One toke over the line!
Sitting downtown
at a railway station
One toke over the line!
One toke, you poor fool?
Sweet, sweet Mary!
Wait'll you see those
goddamned bats, man.
Mine!
One toke over the line
Let's give that boy a lift.
What? No!
Wait! We can't stop here.
This is bat country.
Hot damn ! I never rode
in a convertible before!
Is that right? Well, I guess
you're about ready then,
aren't you?
We're your friends.
We're not like the others,
man. Really.
No more of that talk
or I'll put the fucking
leeches on you. Understand?
(GONZO GIGGLING)
Get in.
DUKE NARRATING: How Iong
could we maintain, l wondered.
How long before
one of us starts raving
and jabbering at this boy?
What will he think then?
This same lonely desert
was the last known home
of the Manson family.
Would he make
that grim connection
when my attorney starts
screaming about bats
and huge manta rays
coming down on the car?
lf so, well, we'll just
have to cut his head off
and bury him somewhere.
'Cause it goes without saying
that we can't turn him loose.
He'd report us at once
to some kind of outback
Nazi law enforcement agency
and they'll run us down
like dogs.
Jesus, did l say that,
or just think it?
Was l talking?
Did they hear me?
It's okay.
Just admiring
the shape of your skull.
BOY: No, thanks!
Maybe l'd better have a chat
with this boy, l thought.
I have asthma!
Perhaps if l explain things,
he'll rest easy.
All right, listen.
There's one thing you should
probably understand.
Can you hear me?
Good.
(EXCLAIMS)
I want you to have
all the background.
This is a very
ominous assignment
with overtones
of extreme personal danger.
I'm a Doctor of Journalism,
man.
This is important,
goddamn it!
This is a fucking true story!
Shit! Hey, what're you doing?
Sit down. Get the fuck. . .
Get your hands
off my fucking head !
Now, now, now.
DUKE NARRATING: Our vibrations
were getting nasty, but why?
Was there no communication
in this car?
Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts?
I want you to understand
that this man at the wheel
is my attorney.
He's not just some dingbat
I found on the Strip, man.
He's a foreigner.
I think he's probably Samoan.
It doesn't matter,
though, does it?
Are you prejudiced?
Hell, no.
I didn't think so.
Because in spite of his race,
this man is extremely valuable
to me.
Oh, shit.
I forgot about the beer.
You want some?
No.
How about some ether?
What?
Never mind.
All right, let's get right
to the heart of this thing.
24 hours ago
we were sitting. . .
DUKE NARRATING:
...in the Pogo Lounge
of the Beverly Heights Hotel.
ln the patio section,
of course.
Drinking Singapore Slings
with mescal on the side.
Hiding from
the brutish realities of
this foul year of our Lord,
1 971 .
Cops were going apeshit. . .
(MUTTERING)
Perhaps this is the call
you've been waiting
for all this time, sir.
Perhaps.
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm. Really?
All right. Yeah?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Okay. Bye.
That was headquarters.
They want me to. . .
(CLEARS THROAT)
(COINS CLATTERING)
(WHISPERING) Thank you.
They want me to go
to Las Vegas at once.
Make contact with
a Portuguese photographer
named Lacerda.
He'll have all the details.
All I have to do
is check into my
soundproof suite.
He'll seek me out.
What do you think?
Sounds like real trouble.
You're gonna need
plenty of legal advice
before this thing is over.
Oh, yeah.
As your attorney,
I advise you
to rent a very fast car
with no top.
And you'll need the cocaine.
Tape recorder
for special music.
Acapulco shirts.
Get the hell out of L.A.
for at least 48 hours.
Blows my weekend.
Why?
'Cause, naturally,
I'm gonna have
to go with you.
And we're gonna have to
arm ourselves to the teeth.
Well, why not?
I mean,
if a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing right.
This is the American Dream
in action.
Wait!
Shit, we'd be fools not to
ride this strange torpedo
all the way out to the end.
Indeed. We must do it.
What kind of story
is this?
It's the Mint 400.
The richest off-road race
for motorcycles
and dune buggies
in the history
of organized sport.
It's a fantastic spectacle
in honor of some
fatback grosero,
who owns
the luxurious Mint Hotel
in downtown Las Vegas.
At least that's what
the press release says,
anyway.
Well, as your attorney,
I advise you to buy
a motorcycle.
How else can you cover
a thing like this righteously?
Well, we're gonna have to
drum it up on our own.
Pure Gonzo journalism.
Shit!
(TIRES SQUEALING)
DUKE NARRATING: Getting
hold of the drugs and shirts
had been no problem.
But the car and tape recorder
were not easy things
to round up
at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon
in Hollywood.
Sounds beautiful.
Great. Hang on to it.
Fucking A,
the gentleman has
a major credit card !
That's right, man.
Don't take any guff
from these fucking swine.
I just got through
saying that.
Do you realize
who the fuck
you're talking to?
Right.
Do you?
Be over in 30 minutes.
DUKE: We're gonna
need a sound store.
GONZO: We won't
make the nut unless
we have unlimited credit.
DUKE: Jesus Christ.
We will, man.
You Samoans
are all the same.
You have no faith
in the essential decency
of the white man's culture.
DUKE NARRATING:
The store was closed.
But the salesman said
he could wait if we hurry.
(SIRENS WAILING)
But we were
delayed en route
when a Stingray in front of us
killed a pedestrian.
We had trouble again
with the car rental agency.
Hey, Mr. Duke,
we're all settled.
If I could just
get your John Hancock,
you're on your way.
Yeah.
Listen,
you're gonna be real
careful with this car, right?
Oh, yeah, man. Of course.
Good. Jeez. . .
No, no, no!
(PANTING)
Holy smokes!
You just backed over
a two-foot concrete abutment,
you didn't even slow down.
What were you going about,
I don't know,
45 miles an hour backwards?
Hey.
There's no harm done.
Oh?
I always test
the transmission that way,
the rear end
for stress factors.
Boy, this is really
a nice pen, man.
Hey, listen, you. . .
You fellows haven't
been drinking, have you?
No. Not me.
Oh.
We're responsible people.
Hey, hey, hey!
Goddamn it,
you've got my pen !
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Goddamn hippies!
DUKE NARRATING: We spent
the rest of that night
rounding up materials
and packing the car.
Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.
Our trip was different.
lt was to be
a classic affirmation
of everything right and true
in the national character.
A gross physical salute
to the fantastic possibilities
of life in this country.
But only for those
with true grit.
And we are chock
full of that, man.
Damn right!
My attorney
understands this concept,
despite his racial handicap.
But do you?
(GIGGLING)
He said he understood,
but l could see in his eyes
that he didn't.
He was lying to me.
(GONZO SCREAMING)
Medicine!
What?
Medicine!
Medicine?
Oh, yeah, medicine. Right.
Right here.
(SHRIEKING)
Don't worry.
This man has a bad heart.
Angina pectoris.
But we have a cure for it.
Here you go.
All right.
Big whiff. Big whiff.
Big whiff, sonny boy.
There you go. Much better.
Now for the doctor.
(GROANING)
(SQUEALING)
What the. . .
What the fuck
are we doing out here
in the middle of the desert?
Somebody call the police.
We need help.
We need help.
We need help. We need help.
(HORN HONKS)
(LAUGHING)
The truth.
Truth?
Now, we're going to Vegas. . .
Vegas.
To croak a scag baron
named Savage Henry.
It's true.
Why? Because I've
known him for years
but he ripped us off.
DUKE: And you know
what that means.
And you know what that means.
Right?
No.
Savage Henry
has cashed his check.
Cashed his check.
And we're gonna
rip his lungs out.
That bastard won't
get away with this.
I mean, what is
going on in this country
when a scum sucker like that
can get away
with sandbagging
a Doctor of Journalism?
Can you tell me that?
Hey!
Thanks for the ride!
I like you guys!
Really, don't worry about me!
Wait a minute!
Come back and have a beer!
Shit. Fuck.
I'm gonna miss him.
Move over.
Did you see his eyes?
We have to get
out of California
before that kid finds a cop.
(CACKLING)
Come on.
Scoot over, you fat bastard.
We had a real freak
on our hands!
Oh, shit.
DUKE NARRATING: It was
absolutely imperative that
we get to the Mint Hotel
before the deadline
for press registration.
Otherwise we might
have to pay for our suite.
(SCREECHING)
Jesus!
Did you see what God
just did to us, man?
God didn't do that.
You did it.
You're a fucking
narcotics agent.
I knew it.
That was our cocaine,
you pig !
You fucking pig, swine, whore!
You better be careful.
Plenty of vultures out here
that'll pick your bones
clean before morning.
You fucking whore.
(FEIGNING LAUGHTER)
Here's your half
of the sunshine acid. Eat it.
Yeah.
Great.
How long do I have?
As your attorney,
I advise you to drive
at top speed
or it'll be a goddamn
miracle if we can get there
before you turn
into a wild animal.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUTTERING)
(SINGING) Yeah, yeah
Are you ready for that?
Checking into a Vegas hotel
under a phony name
with intent to
commit capital fraud
and a head full of acid?
I sure hope so.
DUKE NARRATING: 30 minutes.
lt was going to be very close.
(SINGING) WeII,
she's all you'd ever want
She's the kind
l'd like to flaunt
And take to dinner
MAN ON P.A. : WeIcome
to the Mint Hotel!
(SINGING) WeII,
she always knows her place
She's got style
She's got grace
She's a winner
(HORN HONKING)
She's a lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa
She's a lady
Hmm? Mmm.
(SINGING) TaIking about
my little lady
MAN: Come on, take the ticket.
We're busy here.
(SINGING) And the Iady is mine
Come on, take the ticket.
Take it.
Take the ticket.
I need this, right?
I'll remember your face.
DUKE NARRATING: There is
no way of explaining
the terror l felt.
WOMAN ON P.A. : Attention,
all Mint Hotel guests.
Will the owner
of a green Pinto
Minnesota license plate
TG0432...
DUKE NARRATING:
l was pouring sweat.
My blood is too thick
for Nevada.
l've never been able
to properly explain myself
in this climate.
(MAN CHATTERING)
Okay. Be quiet, be calm.
Name, rank
and press affiliation.
Nothing else.
. . .hamburger stand.
She was a waitress
about 1 6 years old.
They chopped her goddamn
head off right there
in the parking lot.
Then they cut all
kinds of holes in her
and sucked out the blood.
They were after
the pineal gland, I think.
Yeah.
No. How's your mama?
lgnore this terrible drug.
Yeah.
Pretend it's not happening.
(GRUNTS)
Hi there!
My name?
Raoul Duke!
On the list. Freelance.
On the list, then?
Total coverage.
I have my attorney. . .
With me.
And I realize that his name
is not on that list.
But we must have that suite!
Yes, we must have that suite.
What's the score here?
What's next?
Your suite isn't ready yet.
But someone
was looking for you.
No! We haven't done
anything yet! Move!
I can handle this.
This man suffers
from a bad heart.
But I have
plenty of medicine.
My name is Dr. Gonzo.
Prepare our suite at once.
We'll be in the bar.
(GRUNTS)
I don't know about you,
but I'm starting
to feel that drink.
(CHUCKLING)
(GROWLS)
Hey, beat it.
Beat it. Go on.
Well, I like the way
you did that.
(EXCLAIMS)
Come on. Come on. Come on.
What's that?
Come on, come on.
Let's get some peanuts.
DUKE: Peanuts?
That's one thing
that's good for you, man.
Peanuts, man.
Jesus!
2 Cuba Libres, beer
and mescal on the side.
BARTENDER: You got it.
I'll bet you're a Libra.
Mmm.
(LAUGHING)
(WOMAN MOANING)
Who's Lacerda?
Lacerda?
Yeah, he's waiting for us
on the 1 2th floor.
Room 1 250. Lacerda.
DUKE NARRATING:
l couldn't remember.
The name rang a bell,
but l couldn't concentrate.
Terrible things were happening
all around us.
(GURGLING)
Buy us some golf shoes,
otherwise we'll never
get out of this place alive.
Impossible to walk
in this muck.
No footing at all.
WOMAN ON P.A. :
Mr. Roger Pratt, please
call the hotel operator.
(SINGING) How can I bear
to see your heart break?
To see your heart break
Over me
(GROWLING)
l was right in the middle
of a fucking reptile zoo
and somebody was giving booze
to these goddamn things.
lt won't be long now
before they tear us to shreds.
(MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY)
Please!
Tell them to get out
their fucking golf shoes!
(ALL GASPING)
Jesus God Almighty,
look at that bunch
over there, man.
They've spotted us.
GONZO: That's the press table,
man.
We're gonna have to sign in
for our credentials.
Okay?
Are you ready?
Hmm?
Are you ready?
Come on, hurry up.
Wait! Wait, wait!
Fucking don't leave me here!
BOY: Two club sandwiches,
and 2 more club sandwiches.
One, two, three, four
shrimp cocktails.
Hmm?
And nine fresh grapefruit.
GONZO: Vitamin C.
Need all we can get.
BOY: Four chicken. . .
DUKE: There's a big
machine in the sky.
Some kind of. . .
Quart of rum.
Well, electric snake
coming straight at us.
GONZO: Shoot it.
Not yet.
I want to study its habits.
BOY: You motorcycle people
sure are hearty eaters.
I need the cart. I need
to return with the cart.
Thank you, but the cart
needs to go back with. . .
I'll be back!
GONZO: You bastard.
I've been hit, man !
I leave you alone
for three minutes
and you start
waving that goddamn
marlin spike around
yelling about reptiles.
What're you talking about,
man?
You scared the shit
out of those people.
They were ready
to call the cops.
Yes, sir, you were lucky
I came back in time.
Don't come near me.
Don't come fucking near me!
Leave me alone.
Hell, the only reason
they gave us press passes
was to get you
out of there, man.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Oh, God ! What's that?
That scene straightened me
right out, man.
Who's at the door?
MAN ON T.V. : As the bombing
continues in Laos...
Just a minute.
Holy shit. Oh, my God.
(MAN CONTINUES
CHATTERING ON T.V.)
Hi. I'm Lacerda,
your photographer.
Duke?
DUKE: Mmm-hmm.
Back there.
Duke?
Duke? Hi !
(LAUGHS)
Lacerda. Your photographer.
You're not Portuguese, man !
Hey, too bad you guys
missed the bikes checking in.
Oh, man, what a sight!
Husquavarnas, Yamahas, DMZs.
Kawasakis!
Maicos. Pursang !
Swedish Fireballs.
Couple of Triumphs.
Here and there a CZ.
All very, very fast.
Very.
What a race it's gonna be.
Yeah.
I'm gonna let myself out.
We know what
you're up to, man.
Hmm?
I'm gonna tell you. . .
He's lying to us.
I could see it in his eyes.
Eyes?
MAN ON T.V. : Late
battle reports indicate...
Panic now, Charlie.
Turn this shit off.
DUKE NARRATING: The racers
were ready at dawn.
Very tense.
ln some circles, the Mint 400
is a far, far better thing
than the Super Bowl,
the Kentucky Derby
and the Lower Oakland
Roller Derby Finals
all rolled into one.
Hey! Slow down !
This is a restricted area!
This race attracts
a very special breed.
Fuck off.
All right.
lt was time to get grounded,
to ponder this
rotten assignment
and figure out
how to cope with it.
lt was time to do the job.
Those of us
who had been up all night
were in no mood
for coffee and donuts.
We wanted strong drink.
We were, after all
the absolute cream
of the national
sporting press.
MAN: Pull !
We were gathered here
in Las Vegas
for this very
special moment in sport.
When it comes to
a thing like this,
they don't fool around.
(SNORING)
It's just beautiful.
Money plays. Money plays.
Kill the body,
the head will die.
Ali-Frazier fight.
Crazy shit, man.
A proper end to the '60s.
Ali beaten by
a human hamburger.
Both Kennedys
murdered by mutants.
MAN: Hey, they're starting !
Oh, shit, they're starting.
Let's go!
MAN ON P.A. :
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the start
of the $50,000 Mint 400
Desert Race.
With a purse of $50,000
going to the winner
of this grueling,
gut-wrenching, dust-eating,
in-your-face
motocross extravaganza!
And away we go!
We've got
rooster tails going!
We're here to spit
in your enemy's eye!
There they go.
All right, our second group
of 1 0 is getting in place.
Kawasakis, Triumphs, Maicos.
Here we are.
We're ready to go.
lt's the green flag,
and they're off!
Another great start
with a lot of dirt
happening on this hill!
All right, here we go
with the third group.
And they're off!
Here we go.
Number 45 riding in
the number 4 position
is choking as the dust flies!
You'd better wet those
bandannas you got
stretched over your face!
DUKE NARRATING: There was
something like 1 90 more bikes
waiting to start.
Give me a beer, man.
They were due to go off,
1 0 at a time
every two minutes.
BARTENDER: There you go,
buddy.
(BLOWING NOSE)
Goddamn it.
What day is it? Saturday?
Shit.
More like Sunday.
Hello! Anyone?
Have you seen the race?
DUKE NARRATING: By 10:00,
they were spread out
all over the course.
lt was no longer a race.
Now it was
an endurance contest.
The idea of trying
to cover this race
in any conventional
press sense was absurd.
Hey! It's pretty great, huh?
What?
Come on in !
(SHUTTER CLICKING)
I'm just gonna try
different combinations
of lenses and film
until I find something
that works in this dust!
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
What the hell?
(GUNS FIRING)
That's fucking
machine guns, man.
They're firing at us.
Machine guns.
It's a goddamn war zone!
Get us out of here quick!
(LACERDA WHOOPING)
Quick, man !
We're gonna be killed,
for fuck's sake!
What the. . .
Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Where's the damn race?
Beats me, man.
We're just good,
patriotic Americans
like yourself.
What outfit you fellows with?
Oh. The sporting press.
We're friendlies.
Hired geeks.
Yeah.
Let's go.
(LACERDA WHOOPING)
Good luck, gentlemen.
Get him !
Freaks.
Take me back to the pits.
No! No, no, no.
We have to go on.
We need total coverage!
DUKE NARRATING:
lt was time, l felt,
for an agonizing reappraisal
of the whole scene.
You're fired.
Awful jackass.
All right.
Just drive into the dust!
I never wanna see you again.
Just drive into the dust!
Huh?
Oh !
The race was
definitely underway.
l had witnessed the start.
l was sure of that much.
But what now?
What comes next?
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)
Put on the radio.
Turn on the tape machine.
Roll every
goddamn window down.
Let us taste this
cool desert wind.
Ah, yes.
This is what it's all about.
DUKE NARRATING:
Total control now.
Tooling along the main drag
on a Saturday night in Vegas.
Two good old boys
in a fire-apple
red convertible.
Stoned, ripped...
Twisted, good people.
Hot fuck.
That sounds heavy.
29 cent hot dogs.
What are we doing here?
Are we here to
entertain ourselves
or do the job?
Do the job, of course.
Here we go.
Crab Louie and
a quart of muscatel for $20.
As your attorney,
I advise you to drive
over to the Tropicana.
Guy Lombardo.
He's in the Blue Room
with his Royal Canadians.
Why?
Why? Why what?
Why should I pay
my hard-earned dollars
to watch a fucking corpse?
I don't know about you,
but in my line of business
it's important to be hep.
What the hell do you
think you're doing?
This is not a parking area!
You've got to move your car!
You can't park your car here.
Excuse me. Sir!
What?
You can't park. . . Hey!
You can't park your car here!
Why not?
Is this not
a reasonable place to park?
Reasonable?
You're on a sidewalk!
It's a sidewalk!
This is not a parking area!
Debbie Reynolds?
You can't park
on the sidewalk!
Seems like a hot ticket.
Excuse me, sir?
Drove all the way from L.A.
for this show.
We're friends of Debbie's.
(ORCHESTRA PLAYING)
Okay, bye.
We'll see you later.
DUKE NARRATING: This was
Bob Hope's turf,
(SINGING)
Strangers in the night
Frank Sinatra's,
Spiro Agnew's.
(SINGING) Exchanging gIances
The place fairly reeked
of high-grade Formica
and plastic palm trees.
Clearly a high-class
refuge for big spenders.
It's started.
Is she on stage?
MAN: She is. Sold out.
Sorry, sir.
Full house. I'm sorry, sir.
We drove all the way
from L.A. for this show.
I said there are
no seats left, sir,
at any price.
Fuck seats!
We're friends with Debbie.
I used to romp with her.
Are you prepared
to go to court?
Well, that depends.
I wanna talk to you
for a second.
Your attitude constitutes
a breach of faith.
In Nevada, that's illegal.
What's your name?
My name? Tony Pizzacata.
GONZO: Tony Pizzacata.
TONY: What, may I ask,
is your name, sir?
GONZO: It's on my
driver's license.
I think we might be able
to squeeze you in, sir.
Thank you kindly.
You'll have to
stand in the back.
After a lot of bad noise
he let us in for nothing
provided
we would stand quietly
in the back and not smoke.
Excellent.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Desert lnn
is proud to present
the one, the only,
the incomparable
Miss Debbie Reynolds!
(CHORUS SINGING)
Ooh, ooh
DEBBIE: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!
lt's wonderful to be here
with all you fabulous people!
Let's rock and roll!
(CHORUS SINGING)
Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
Hey!
What the hell's going on?
Get them out!
Come on, get out of here!
Get them out.
Out!
(DUKE GIGGLING HYSTERICALLY)
Shit! We wandered into
a fucking time capsule there.
Scumbag !
I'll find where you live
and burn your house down,
you piece of shit!
What happened?
Oh.
One of these days I'll toss
a fucking bomb in that place.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, wait. You see that?
This is the place, man.
They'll never
fuck with us here.
Where's the ether?
Mescaline's not working.
Oh.
There we go. Right.
Yeah. Why not?
Yeah.
(SNIFFING)
(GROANS)
DUKE NARRATING: DeviI ether.
lt makes you behave
like the village drunkard
in some early lrish novel.
Total loss of all
basic motor skills.
Blurred vision,
no balance, numb tongue.
The mind recoils in horror,
unable to communicate
with the spinal column,
which is interesting
because you can
actually watch yourself
behaving in this terrible way
but you can't control it.
You approach the turnstiles
and know that
when you get there
you have to give the man $2
or he won't let you inside.
But when you get there
everything goes wrong.
Some angry Rotarian
shoves you
and you think,
"What's happening here?
"What's going on?"
And you hear
yourself mumbling.
Dogs fucked the Pope.
No fault of mine.
(MUMBLING)
Ether is the perfect drug
for Las Vegas.
ln this town
they love a drunk.
Fresh meat.
Come on, buddy. Come on.
Holy. . .
So they put us
through the turnstiles
and turned us loose inside.
(DRUM ROLL)
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,
visitors of all ages,
the Bazooko Casino Circus
proudly presents,
the Flying Fellinis!
(WHOOPING)
Oh, my God !
(SNIFFS DEEPLY)
(SNARLING)
Fuck!
Excuse me.
Get out of my way, you. . .
(ELEPHANT TRUMPETS)
DUKE NARRATING: A drug person
can learn to cope
with things like
seeing their dead grandmother
crawling up their leg
with a knife in her teeth,
but nobody should be asked
to handle this trip.
Bazooko Circus
is what the whole hep world
would be doing Saturday night
if the Nazis had won the War.
This was the Sixth Reich.
Place your bets!
Where everyone's a winner
and nobody's a loser!
Step right up and shoot
the pasties off the nipples
of a 1 0-foot bull dyke
and win a cotton candy goat!
(JABBERING)
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
Step up to this
fantastic machine!
For just 99 cents,
your likeness will
appear 200 feet tall
on a screen over
downtown Las Vegas.
For just 99 cents more
you can have a voice message!
Say whatever you want,
fellow!
Oh, they'll hear you,
all right!
You'll be 200 feet tall !
DUKE NARRATING: The ether
was wearing off.
The acid was long gone.
But the mescaline
was running strong.
(MAN CHATTERING)
Good mescaline comes on slow.
The first hour's all waiting.
And then about
halfway through
its second hour,
you start cursing
the creep who burned you
because nothing's happening.
And then, zang!
I hate to say this
but this place
is getting to me.
(HICCUPPING)
I think I'm getting the fear.
Nonsense.
We came here to find
the American Dream.
Now that we're
right in the vortex,
you wanna quit?
You must realize, man,
we've found the main nerve.
That's what
gives me the fear.
Oh, look!
What?
There's two women
fucking a polar bear.
Don't tell me
those things.
Not now, man.
This is my last drink.
How much money
can you lend me?
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
Go?
Yeah. Leave the country.
Oh, no. Calm down.
You'll be straight
in a few hours.
Just sit down.
Sit the fuck down.
Don't fuck around, man.
This is serious.
One more hour in this town,
I'll kill somebody.
Okay,
I'll lend you some money.
Come with me.
I wanna leave fast.
Okay.
Let's pay this bill,
get up very slowly.
I think it's gonna
be a long walk.
WOMAN: Light, sir?
Do they pay you
to screw that bear?
What?
What the fuck
did he say to me?
He's drunk.
You'd better take care
of your friend.
Madam, sir, baby, child,
whatever, can I pay?
Here, take this.
That should be enough.
All right, come on.
Let's go downstairs
and gamble.
You guys don't
fucking give up.
Where'd he go?
Where did he go?
When is this
thing gonna stop?
Stop?
Stop it!
It won't stop.
It's never gonna stop, man.
Don't move. You'll fall down.
Fuck, he's. . .
Where did he go? Oh.
Come on. Let go.
Quick, like a bunny.
Hop! Hop!
Come on. Hop!
I can't!
Oh, you sniveling,
chicken shit bastard !
Stop it!
All right.
Fuck!
Come on.
You fell, you fell. Let's go.
Son of a bitch.
You pushed me.
Go away!
Come on.
All right. You stay here
and go to jail. I'm leaving.
Come on, you fiend !
Step right over. . .
Nothing. I want nothing.
Did you see that?
Come on.
Some son of a bitch
just kicked me in the back.
Probably the bartender.
Wanted to stomp you
for what you said
to the waitress.
Holy moley! Holy moley!
Cows are gonna kill me!
Bisexuals are gonna kill me.
Let's get out of here.
Where's the elevator?
No, fuck! Don't go
near the elevator, man !
That's just what
they want us to do.
Trap us in a steel box,
take us down to the basement.
Come here.
(GUN FIRING)
Don't run, man.
They'd like any excuse
to shoot us.
You drive. You drive.
I think there's
something wrong with me.
Wrong door. Wrong door.
DUKE NARRATING:
This is not a good town
for psychedelic drugs.
Extremely menacing vibrations
were all around us.
We finally made it
to the room,
but the key
wouldn't open the door.
Those bastards have changed
the lock on us, man.
Already?
They probably
searched the room, man.
Jesus Christ,
we're finished.
Move out of the way.
Look out! Look out!
(GRUNTS)
(EXCLAIMS)
Bolt everything !
Use all the chains!
(MUMBLING)
That's better. That's better.
Where did this one come from?
That's Lacerda's.
Yeah. Yeah.
I thought we might need it.
What for?
So we can go up there
and blast him out of bed
with a fire hose, man.
I think we should leave
that poor bastard alone.
He told me he was
gonna turn in early, so. . .
I knew it.
He got a hold
of my woman, man !
You mean that blonde groupie
with the film crew?
Shit.
Think he sodomized her?
That's right.
Laugh about it.
He's gluing her eyes
shut right now, man.
You goddamn honkies
are all the same.
Jesus God Almighty, man,
where'd you get
that big fucker?
Room service sent it up.
I needed something
to cut the limes, man.
Limes? What limes?
They didn't have any.
They don't grow
in the desert.
That dirty toad bastard.
Should've taken him out
when I had a chance.
(ROARS)
Now he has her, man !
He got a hold of my baby,
yeah.
DUKE NARRATING:
l remembered the girl.
We'd had a problem with her
in the elevator
a few hours earlier.
My attorney had
made a fool of himself.
I think you look
just like him.
You think so?
You must be a rider.
Hmm?
She's speaking to you.
What class are you in?
Class?
What the fuck do you mean?
What do you ride?
See, we're here getting
a little footage
on the race for
a television series.
I thought maybe
we could use you.
Oh, use me? I ride a. . .
"Mother of God," l thought.
Here it comes.
I ride the big fuckers.
You know? Big ones.
The really big fuckers. Yeah.
Vincent Black Shadow.
We're with the factory team.
Right.
Bullshit.
What?
Bullshit.
Hmm?
I think there's
some kind of ignorant,
chicken shit. . .
Move over, man.
An ignorant chicken
fucker in this town.
You pink motherfucker.
I can show you
better than I can
tell you, ma'am.
Got a light?
No.
You don't trust me, do you?
Huh?
Put the smile away.
It's okay.
I know these guys.
Keep trying me, jerk-off.
Keep trying me.
You wanna impress her?
Well, impress her with me.
Oh, fuck.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
(GONZO WHOOPS)
No, you goddamn freak! Freak!
The police will be
coming after you.
(SINGING) For your Iove
Give me the key.
Give me the goddamn key!
(SINGING) For your Iove
(WHOOPS)
(SINGING) For your Iove
l give you everything and more
Put the knife away.
I been walking all day.
Come on.
It's in my pocket. Come on.
(SINGING) For your Iove
l give you everything
l give you diamonds
l know the place
that will excite
Goddamn it.
It's serious now, man.
That girl understood, man.
Whew.
She fell in love with me, man.
Eye contact, man.
Wait.
(GROANS)
I should go up there
and castrate that fucker.
I'll take the blame, man.
Let's just leave that
weird fucker alone, man.
Come on.
Have you made
a deal with him?
Did you put him on to her?
Huh? Huh?
Huh?
All right, look. . .
You better put
that goddamn blade away, man.
Get your fucking head
straight.
I'm gonna go get
the car washed.
DUKE NARRATING:
One of the things you learn
after years of dealing
with drug people,
is that you can turn
your back on a person,
but never turn
your back on a drug.
Especially when it's waving
a razor-sharp hunting knife
in your eye.
(BELL DINGS)
(WOMAN SOBBING)
(SLOT MACHINE CLICKING)
What was l doing out here?
What was the meaning
of this trip?
Was l just roaming around
in a drug frenzy of some kind?
Or had l really come
out here to Las Vegas
to work on a story?
Who are these people,
these faces?
Where do they come from?
They look like caricatures
of used car dealers
from Dallas.
And, sweet Jesus,
there are a hell
of a lot of them
at 4:30 on a Sunday morning,
still humping
the American Dream,
that vision of the big winner
somehow emerging
from the last-minute,
pre-dawn chaos
of a stale Vegas casino.
Twenty.
We change a 20.
Thank you.
Here we go.
Okay.
(SINGING) Spinning the wheeI,
spinning the wheel,
spinning the wheel
Make me rich
Make me very rich
(EXCLAIMING)
That's 1 0.
Oh, you bastard !
Shit.
Sorry.
DUKE NARRATING: No, no.
Calm down.
Learn to enjoy losing.
(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Fuck, man, it's the fucking
Great Deluge in here.
Don't touch that.
Leave it alone.
Don't fuck with it, man !
Jesus Christ.
Oh, God.
Did you eat all this acid?
That's right. Music!
You better pray to God
there's some Thorazine
in that bag.
Otherwise, you're in
bad fucking trouble.
Music, man,
put that tape on !
What tape?
Jefferson Airplane.
White Rabbit.
I need a rising sound.
You're doomed.
I'm leaving here
in two hours.
Then they're gonna come up
here and beat the mortal shit
out of you
right there
in that fucking tub.
(GRUNTING)
All right, I'll do it!
I'll do it.
I'll do it. Fuck, man.
Just do me one last favor,
will you?
Give me two hours.
That's all I ask, man.
Two hours to sleep
before tomorrow.
This is fixed.
It's gonna be
a very difficult day.
I'll give you all
the time you need.
Electrocution.
We don't want that.
Fuck off.
(FARTS)
(SINGING) When Iogic
and proportion have fallen
Goddamn it!
(SINGING) SIoppy dead
And the White Knight
is talking backwards
Let's see.
(SINGING) And the Red Queen's
off with her head
Remember
Oh, God Almighty.
GONZO: Help! Help!
Help me! Help!
Shit! He's killing himself!
(SINGING)
What the dormouse said
Don't touch it, man.
Don't touch it!
(GROANING)
For fuck's sake, man !
(SINGING) Feed your head
(MUTTERING)
Back, God. . .
Back, motherfucker!
(GASPING)
On a roll, man !
I need it again !
What?
When it comes to
that fantastic note,
(PANTING)
when the rabbit
bites its own head off.
I want you to throw
that fucking radio
into the tub with me.
Fuck, you've gone
completely sideways, man.
That'll blast you
right through the wall.
You'll be stone dead
in 1 0 seconds.
Fuck, they'll make me
explain things. Shit.
Bullshit.
Don't fuck with me now, man.
I am Ahab.
Jesus Christ.
All right, you weird fucker!
Sit down ! Back in the tub!
I'll plunge this into
your fucking throat.
Don't make me use this,
man.
All right, man.
Probably the only solution.
Let me make sure
I've got this all lined up.
You want me to
throw this thing into the tub
when White Rabbit peaks,
is that it?
Oh, fuck.
I was beginning to think
I was gonna have to go outside
and get one of the
goddamn maids to do it.
Oh, no. I'll do it.
Shit. What are friends for?
(GROANING)
(SINGING) I think she'II know
You ready?
(SINGING) Where Iogic
Close your eyes.
(SINGING) And proportion
Yeah, good boy.
(SINGING)
Have fallen sloppy dead
Rabbit! White Rabbit!
Quiet, goddamn it!
You're wasting my time!
Higher, man. Higher.
(VOLUME INCREASES)
(SINGING) Remember
Okay, close those peepers.
Ten.
(GROANING)
What the dormouse said
Nine. 1 1 1 !
(SINGING) Feed your head
52!
Feed your head
Hey! Hey! Hey!
(GONZO SHRIEKING)
You bastard !
Mace! Mace, man.
You want this?
You'd do that,
wouldn't you?
Well, why not?
You fucking bastard !
Hell, just a minute ago
you were asking me
to kill you.
Now you wanna kill me.
What l should do, goddamn it,
is call the fucking police!
Boy, are you upset.
There'd be no point, man,
calling the cops.
There's no choice.
l wouldn't dare go to sleep
with you wandering around
with a head full of acid
wanting to slice me up
with that goddamn knife.
Who said anything
about slicing you up, man?
I just wanted to cut
a little "Z" in your forehead.
(WHEEZING LAUGHTER)
Get back in the tub.
Eat some reds
and try to calm down.
Smoke some grass.
Shoot some fucking smack.
Shit, man, do whatever
you gotta do, but please,
l need some fucking rest, man.
Please. Please.
Get up, you pig fucker!
Up! Up!
Well, I, uh. . .
Yeah.
You need to get to work.
Goddamn, what a bummer.
You scurvy shyster bastard.
l'm a Doctor of Journalism,
man.
Go on.
Don't let me keep you up.
Now...
Don't let me keep you up.
Get in there
and clean your shorts!
Clean your shorts, goddamn it,
like a big boy. Go on!
Pig!
DUKE NARRATING: The acid
had shifted gears on him.
The next phase
would probably be
one of those
hellishly intense
introspective nightmares.
Must get some peace.
DUKE NARRATING:
Four hours or so
of catatonic despair.
Damn drugs.
Mmm?
lgnore the nightmare
in the bathroom.
Just another ugly refugee
from the love generation.
My attorney had
never been able
to accept the notion
often espoused by
former drug abusers
that you can get a lot higher
without drugs than with them.
And neither have l,
for that matter.
(SINGING)
When the truth is found
To be lies
And all the joy
Within you dies
Don't you want
somebody to love
Don't you need
somebody to love
Wouldn't you love
somebody to love
You better find
somebody to love
Love
DUKE NARRATING: 1965.
The great San Francisco
acid wave.
(SINGING)
When the garden flowers
l recall one night
in a place called the Matrix.
There l was.
Mother of God. There l am.
Holy fuck.
Clearly l was a victim
of the drug explosion,
a natural street freak just
eating whatever came by.
Does anybody want some LSD?
I got all the makings
right here!
(ECHOING)
All I need is a place
to cook.
l decided to eat only
half of the acid at first.
But l spilled the rest
on the sleeve of
my red woolen shirt.
(ECHOING)
What's the trouble?
(ECHOING) Well, all this
white stuff on my sleeve
is LSD.
DUKE: With a bit of luck,
his life was ruined forever.
Always thinking that just
behind some narrow door
in all his favorite bars,
men in red woolen shirts
are getting incredible kicks
from things he'll never know.
Strange memories
on this nervous night
in Las Vegas.
Has it been five years? Six?
lt seems like a lifetime,
the kind of peak
that never comes again.
(SINGING) Love is but a song
we're singing
San Francisco
in the middle '60s
was a very special time
and place to be a part of,
but no explanation.
(SINGING) We can make
the mountains ring
No mix of words
or music or memories
can touch
that sense of knowing
that you were there and alive
in that corner of time
in the world,
whatever it meant.
(SINGING)
Though the bird is on the wing
(SINGING)
And you may not know why
There was madness
in any direction,
at any hour.
(SINGING) Come on peopIe, now
You could strike sparks
anywhere.
(SINGING)
Try to love one another
There was a fantastic
universal sense
that whatever we were doing
was right,
that we were winning.
And that, l think,
was the handle.
(SINGING) Some may come
and some may go
That sense of inevitable
victory over the forces
of old and evil.
Not in any mean
or military sense,
we didn't need that.
Our energy would
simply prevail.
We had all the momentum.
We were riding the crest
of a high and beautiful wave.
So now,
less than 5 years later,
you can go up a steep hill
in Las Vegas and look west
and with the right kind
of eyes,
you can almost see
the high-water mark,
that place where
the wave finally broke
and rolled back.
(SINGING) Try to Iove
one another right now
(ELECTRIC PIANO PLAYING)
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
(SINGING) Want some whiskey
in your water?
Room service!
Some sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy
questions they're asking me?
Good morning, sir.
This is the craziest party
there could ever be
What do you want, man?
What do you want?
Room service.
Get out.
Mama told me not to come
You're not mine.
You're in the wrong room.
Get out! Get the fuck out!
I've got a gun.
It's not mine, really.
Get out.
The. . . The. . . The. . .
What?
The bill.
All right.
Will you sign for it?
Yeah, I'll get it. Hurry up.
Don't move, man.
Be very still. There we go.
Say nothing to no one, man.
Open up the window
Let some air into this room
DUKE NARRATING:
The decision to flee
came suddenly.
Or maybe not.
That cigarette you're smoking
about scared me half to death
Maybe l'd planned it
all along, subconsciously
waiting for the right moment.
Mama told me not to come
The bill was a factor,
l think,
because l had no money
to pay for it.
Mama told me not to come
Our room service tabs
had been running
somewhere between
29 and 36 dollars per hour
for 48 consecutive hours.
lncredible.
That ain't the way
to have fun, son
How could it happen?
But by the time
l asked this question,
there was no one around
to answer it.
That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.
He must have sensed trouble.
Hmm? Oh. A "Z"?
Panic.
lt crept up my spine
like first-rising vibes
of an acid frenzy.
All these horrible realities
began to dawn on me.
DUKE: Oh, fuck.
DUKE NARRATING: Here I was,
alone in Las Vegas,
completely twisted on drugs.
No cash,
no story for the magazine,
and on top of everything else
l had a gigantic goddamn
hotel bill to deal with.
l didn't even know
who'd won the race.
Maybe nobody.
How would Horatio Alger
have handled this situation?
Stay calm. Stay calm.
l'm a relatively
respectable citizen.
Multiple felon, perhaps,
but certainly not dangerous.
Taxi !
Luckily, l had taken
the soap and grapefruit
and other luggage
out to the car
a few hours earlier.
Now, it was only a matter
of slipping the noose.
Hey! Here, take this.
All right.
Mr. Duke! Mr. Duke!
Oh, shit.
We've been looking for you.
The game was up.
They had me.
Many fine books have been
written in prison, huh?
Sir?
What?
This telegram came for you.
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named
Thompson.
But it says,
"Care of Raoul Duke."
Do you. . . Do you. . .
Does that mean anything?
Yes, yes, it means a lot.
Thanks.
Yeah, I checked the register
for this man Thompson.
We don't show him,
but I figured he might
be part of your team.
He is. Don't worry.
I'll get it to him.
Yeah. What confused us was
Dr. Gonzo's signature
on the telegram
from Los Angeles
when we knew he was
right here in the hotel.
Right.
You did the right thing.
Never try to understand
a press message.
About half the time,
we use codes.
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.
See you.
Tell me. . .
(TIRES SCREECHING)
When will the doctor
be awake?
Awake? What do you mean?
Well, my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.
It's nothing unusual,
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all of our large accounts,
put them on a personal basis,
you know?
Just a chat and a handshake.
You understand.
Of course, but if I were you,
I would leave the
doctor alone until after
he's eaten his breakfast
because he's
a very crude man.
Jesus God !
No!
But he will be available
maybe later this morning?
Look, the telegram is
actually all scrambled.
It's actually from Thompson,
not to him.
All right?
Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.
But there's no hurry.
The race is over.
Not for me.
Well, let's have lunch !
Righty-o, man. Righty-o.
(SINGING) Now, the bricks
lay on Grand Street
DUKE NARRATING: Jesus.
Bad waves of paranoia.
Madness. Fear and loathing.
lntolerable vibrations
in this place.
Get out.
The weasels were closing in.
l could smell the ugly brutes.
Do me one last favor, Lord.
Just give me five more
high-speed hours
before You bring
the hammer down.
Just let me get rid
of this goddamn car
and off this horrible desert.
(SINGING) Oh, Mama
ls this really the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
Oh, you evil bastard.
With the Memphis blues again
This is Your work.
You better take care of me,
Lord.
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)
If You don't, You're gonna
have me on Your hands.
Pull over!
Hey!
Pull over!
Good morning. How are you?
All right, man.
Doing very well.
Few people understand
the psychology of dealing
with a highway traffic cop.
Your normal speeder will panic
and immediately pull over
to the side.
This is wrong. lt arouses
contempt in the cop heart.
Make the bastard chase you.
He will follow.
But he won't know what to
make of your blinker signal
that says you're
about to turn right.
This is to let him know
you're pulling off for
a proper place to talk.
lt'll take him
a moment to realize
that he's about to make
a 1 80-degree turn, at speed.
But you will be ready for him.
Brace for the "G"s.
Fast heel-toe work.
COP: Shit! Shit!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(SIREN WAILING)
Hi. How are you?
Just what in the hell
did you think
you were doing?
I wanna know.
Let me see your license.
Oh, yeah, of course.
There you are.
Oh, my gosh.
It's me.
May I please have that?
DUKE NARRATING:
l knew l was fucked.
See you have
two cases of beer,
a basket of grapefruit,
stack of T-shirts and towels,
light bulbs.
You realize what you did
when you drive like that?
Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.
I understand that.
I knew it was a crime.
I did it anyway.
Shit, why argue?
I'm a fucking criminal.
Look at me.
You have a strange attitude.
Maybe.
You know, I have a feeling
you need to take a nap.
There's a rest area
just up ahead.
I'd like you to
go up there, pull over
and get a few hours' sleep.
That's not gonna help me.
I've been awake for too long,
three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.
I go to sleep now,
I'm dead for 20 hours.
What are you carrying
two cases of soap for, son?
I wanna stay clean.
No.
Here's how it is.
What I put in my book,
as of noon,
is that I apprehended you
for driving too fast.
(HUMMING)
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area. . . Stop!
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area, your
stated destination, right?
And take a long nap.
Do I make myself clear?
Well, how far is Baker?
I was sort of hoping to,
I don't know,
stop there for lunch.
It's not my jurisdiction.
City limits end 2.2 miles
beyond the rest area.
Can you make it that far?
I'll try.
I've been wanting to go
to Baker for a long time.
Yeah. Heard a lot about it.
Excellent seafood.
You know, I'm thinking,
a guy with your kind of mind
ought to try the land-crab.
Excellent seafood.
Land-crab.
All right. Why not?
Thanks for the tip.
Look at me in the eyes.
Everything all right?
May I have a little kiss
before you go?
I'm very lonely here.
(SINGING) Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
DUKE NARRATING: I feIt raped.
The pig had done me
on all fronts.
And now he was going off
to chuckle about it on
the west side of town,
waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.
Why, yes, Officer.
Of course l'll take advantage
of that rest area.
And l can't tell you how
grateful l am for this break
you wanna give me.
Get a grip, man.
lf l boom straight for L.A.
he'll bust me for sure.
No.
This was not the time
for a showdown.
This was Death Valley.
(GASPING)
DUKE: Oh, fuck!
Sweet Jesus, it's him.
Oh, my God !
(HUMMING)
(ENGINE STALLING)
Shit! Come on,
you fucking bastard.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I've got to go. I've got to. . .
Well, they've nailed me,
goddamn it.
I'm trapped in
some stinking desert
crossroads called Baker.
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.
They'll hunt me down
like a fucking beast.
GONZO:
You sound a little paranoid.
I need a fucking lawyer
immediately!
What are you doing in Baker?
Didn't you get my telegram?
What telegram,
you worthless bastard?
I'll cripple your ass
for this.
You brainless scumbag,
you're supposed to be
in Vegas.
I rented a suite
at the Flamingo.
You're supposed to be
covering the National District
Attorney's conference.
l made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.
Now, what the fuck are you
doing out there in the
middle of the desert?
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.
I'm actually. . .
I'm poolside at the
Flamingo right now,
talking through a portable
phone some dwarf brought
out from the casino.
Yeah,
I have total credit here.
Don't come anywhere near
this place, you bastard.
Foreigners
aren't welcome here.
DUKE NARRATING:
Well, this is
how the world works.
All energy flows
according to the whims
of the Great Magnet.
What a fool l was to defy him.
l was going back to Vegas.
l had no choice.
(GUN FIRING)
l had to get rid of the Shark.
Too many people
might recognize it,
especially the Vegas police.
Luckily, my credit card
was still technically valid.
Now this was
a superior machine.
Ten grand worth
of gimmicks and
high-priced special effects.
The rear windows leapt up
with a touch like
frogs in a dynamite pond.
The dashboard was
full of esoteric lights
and dials and meters
that l would
never understand.
lf the pigs were
gathering in Vegas,
l felt the drug culture
should be represented as well.
And there was a certain
bent appeal in the notion
of running a savage burn
on one Las Vegas hotel,
and then just
wheeling across town
and checking into another.
Me and 1 ,000 ranking cops
from all over America.
Why not move confidently
into their midst?
Welcome to
the Flamingo Hotel, sir.
(GRUNTING)
Sir?
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.
(SINGING)
Let me stay in your arms
l'm addicted to your charms
You're getting to be
a habit with me
l used to think your love
was something that l
Could take
Or leave alone
DUKE NARRATING: My arrivaI
was badly timed.
(SINGING) But now I couIdn't
do without my supply
l need you for my own
This here model is one
that we had to use
when we took on
them little peckerheads
down there at Kent State.
And this baby here. . .
I'm a police chief
from Michigan.
Look, fella,
I have explained to you.
I have this postcard
which says that I have
a reservation in this hotel.
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you're on the late list.
And so, your reservation
has been transferred to. . .
It's okay.
. . .the Moonlight Motel
which is just out on
Paradise Boulevard.
We've already paid
for our goddamn room !
Well, it's actually a very
fine place of lodging,
and it's only
1 6 blocks from here.
It has a pool, sauna, steam.
You listen to me,
you filthy little faggot!
I want a manager down here,
now, now!
Now, because I'm sick of
listening to your dog shit!
I am very sorry, sir.
Get off of me!
Get away from me!
Can I call you a cab?
Sure, and I'll call you
a cocksucker!
DUKE NARRATING: Of course,
l could hear what the
clerk was really saying.
Listen,
you fuzzy little shithead !
I've been fucked around
in my time
by a fairly good cross section
of mean-tempered,
rule-crazy cops.
And now, it's my turn.
So fuck you, Officer.
I'm in charge.
Hey, listen,
I really hate to interrupt,
but I wonder if I could
just slide on through
and get out of your way.
The name is Duke. Raoul Duke.
I think my attorney
made the reservations.
Duke, Raoul.
Certainly, sir.
My bags. . . My bags are
out there in that white
Cadillac convertible there.
Maybe somebody could
bring it to the room for me.
Well, let me get
a quart of Wild Turkey,
two-fifths of Bacardi,
some ice for the room,
and let's see. . .
You just calm down !
Shit, let's try
some lime chunks.
What do you think?
I say okay.
You don't worry
about a thing.
Now, calm down.
You don't hesitate
to call me, Sven.
All right, Sven.
(WAILING)
Thank you very much.
You. . . You. . .
I know, I know, I know.
It's hideous.
You're gonna be fine, though.
You're doing well.
I'll see you later. Wait.
Don't touch it.
Good night. Pardon me.
Bye, Sven.
(CRYING)
Look what you did !
Look what you did !
Goddamn you,
we wouldn't stay in this
hotel if you begged us!
(SINGING) Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Home, sweet home. Whoa.
What kind of sick shit. . .
(LUCY GRUNTING)
Oh, shit!
(GRUNTING)
Shit. What the fuck?
Stop, stop, stop.
She's biting my leg off!
You degenerate pig. Please!
Can't be helped.
My fucking leg !
That's "Lucy In The Sky
With Diamonds."
Lucy, be cool,
goddamn it.
Remember what happened
at the airport, okay?
Come on.
(LUCY WHIMPERS)
No more of that, okay?
That's my client, Lucy.
That's Mr. Duke,
the famous journalist.
He's paying for this suite,
Lucy.
He's on our side.
He loves artists.
Lucy paints portraits
of Barbra Streisand.
Right?
I drew these from TV.
Really.
She came all the way down. . .
What's the name
of that town?
Montana.
Montana.
Just to give these
portraits to Barbra.
We're going over to
the Americana tonight
to meet her backstage.
DUKE NARRATING: I desperateIy
needed peace, rest, sanctuary.
l hadn't counted on this,
finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind
of preternatural courtship.
Well.
They must have brought
the car around by now.
So why don't
ou-yay and I-ay
o-gay and et-gay the
uff-stay out of the unk-tray.
Absolutely. Yeah.
Let's get the stuff.
We'll be right back, Lucy.
Give me a kiss?
One kiss, one kiss.
No.
LUCY: No.
GONZO: One kiss.
No.
Why not?
No.
Okay.
Don't answer the phone.
God bless.
Well, what are your plans?
Plans?
The child in the bedroom.
Oh, Lucy.
I met her on the plane.
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.
I gave her a cap
before I realized. . .
Jesus, she's never even
had a drink.
DUKE: Well,
it'll probably work out.
We can keep her loaded,
and then peddle her ass
at the drug convention.
Yeah,
she's perfect for this gig.
These cops'll go
50 bucks a head
to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.
We can set her up
in one of these
backstreet motels,
hang pictures of Jesus
all over the room,
and then turn these
fucking pigs loose on her.
Hell, she's strong, man.
She'll hold her own.
Jesus Christ,
I knew you were sick,
but I never expected to
hear you actually say
that kind of stuff.
You filthy bastard.
Straight economics, man.
This girl's a godsend.
Shit. She could make us
a grand a day.
That's ugly, man.
Stop talking like that.
Well, I figure she can do
about four at a time.
If we keep her full of acid,
that's more like two grand
a day, maybe three.
Hold on, man.
What if I just jump on you
and beat the dog shit
out of you?
Would that make
you feel any better,
you filthy bastard?
All right, listen to me.
In a few hours,
she'll probably be sane
enough to work herself
into some sort of towering
Jesus-based rage
at the hazy recollection
of being seduced by
some kind of cruel Samoan
who fed her liquor and LSD,
dragged her
to a Vegas hotel room
and then savagely
penetrated every orifice
in her little body
with his throbbing,
uncircumcised member.
(WOMAN GASPING)
That's so ugly, man.
Well, fuck, truth hurts.
That's "Argh !"
Yeah.
Argh !
That's argh ! Argh !
That's argh !
Argh?
I wanted to help her, man.
Well, you'll go straight
to the gas chamber
for this one.
Even if you manage
to beat that, they'll still
send you back to Nevada
for rape
and consensual sodomy.
No, she's gotta go.
Shit.
It doesn't pay to
try to help somebody
these days, huh?
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)
Let's go.
Yeah. Americana Hotel?
I need a reservation.
For my niece.
Look, I want her
treated very gently.
She's an artist and. . .
Fuck off.
She might seem
a trifle high-strung.
She's doing her
Masters' thesis on,
well, Barbra Streisand.
It's time to meet Barbra.
Last name?
I'd rather not say.
My brother's in politics.
Yeah, you understand.
DUKE NARRATING:
l felt like a Nazi,
but it had to be done.
Yeah, yeah, righto.
Okay, yeah. Bye.
Yummy, yummy, yummy
l've got love in my tummy
And l feel like loving you
(HORN HONKING)
Love is such a sweet thing
Good enough to eat
And it's just
what l'm gonna do
DUKE NARRATING:
Lucy was a potentially fatal
millstone on both our necks.
Hurry the fuck up!
There was absolutely no choice
but to cut her adrift...
Jesus Christ. Take your time!
...and hope her memory
was fucked.
Here's an extra 1 0 bucks,
buddy.
Make sure
she gets there safely.
(IMPATIENT HUMMING)
That's that.
Hey, man, take off slowly.
Don't attract attention.
(HUMMING)
Yummy, yummy, yummy
l've got love in my tummy
Let's find a good
seafood restaurant
and eat some red salmon.
I feel a powerful lust
for red salmon.
(GONZO RETCHING)
Oh, no, man.
We're gonna be late.
We gotta go.
Goddamn mescaline.
Why the fuck can't they
make it a little less pure?
l welcome you to the third
National D.A.'s Convention
on Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs.
And now, without further ado,
the man who will define
this cancer eating
at the heart of America.
Dr. L. Ron Bumquist.
I saw these bastards
in Easy Rider, but I didn't
believe they were real.
Not like this, man,
not hundreds of them.
They're actually
pretty nice people
once you get to know them.
Know them?
I know these people
in my goddamn blood.
Don't say that
word around here.
You'll get them excited.
You're right.
The most efficient
way for us to do this
is for each one of us
to try and attempt
to imagine what it is like
inside of the possessed
mind of the addict.
Hmm?
For example, a dope fiend
refers to the reefer butt
as a "roach"
because it resembles
a cockroach.
What the fuck are these
people talking about?
You've got to be crazy on acid
to think a joint looks like
a goddamn cockroach.
...you will notice that
l have distinguished four...
Four distinct states of being
in the cannabis
or marijuana society.
They are cool, groovy,
hip and square.
SeIdom, if ever...
Too crazy, man. Too crazy.
(GRUNTING)
We should get the hell out.
What a fucking nightmare.
lf he figures out
what is happening
then he can rise one notch
and become hip.
And then if he can
convince himself
to approve
of what is happening,
then he becomes groovy.
Groovy.
And then, after that,
he can actually raise himself
to the rank of cool.
He can become one of those
cool guys.
MAN: Dr. Bumquist.
You think the anthropologist
Margaret Mead's
strange behavior of late
could be explained
by a private marijuana
addiction?
Good question.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
l'm not really sure
l can answer that.
But what l can tell you, sir,
is if Margaret Mead,
at her age
smoked grass,
she'd have one hell of a trip.
(ALL LAUGHING)
One more layer
of deviance to the woman.
This is fuckin' bullshit.
I'll be out in the casino.
Shut up, man. Go to hell !
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.
MAN: Projector, please.
Excuse me.
All right.
(MUSIC PLAYING ONSCREEN)
MALE NARRATOR:
Know your dope fiend.
Your life may depend on it.
You will not be able
to see his eyes,
because of Tea Shades,
but his knuckles will be white
from inner tension.
And his pants
will be crusted with semen
from constantly jacking off
when he can't find
a rape victim.
He will stagger and babble
when questioned.
(WOMAN MOANING)
He will not respect
your badge.
The dope fiend fears nothing.
He will attack for no reason,
with any weapon
at his command
(BOTH MOANING)
including yours.
Cheers.
Beware. Any officer
apprehending
a suspected
marijuana addict...
Pardon me.
...should use all necessary
force immediately.
Sorry. Pardon me.
One stitch in time
on him will usually save nine
(ECHOING) on you.
GONZO: Oh, God. Oh, God.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
(PHONE RINGING)
(GONZO MOANING)
Yeah?
Yes, Mr. Duke, hello.
You have one message.
Call Lucy. . .
(GONZO RETCHING)
...at the Americana Hotel,
room 1 600.
Oh, fuck.
(DIAL TONE)
Hello?
Lucy called.
(GONZO RETCHING)
(TOILET FLUSHING)
What?
Lucy called.
What?
Lucy called, man.
(PHONE RINGING)
Those two men in the dock,
they gave me the LSD
and they took me to the hotel.
l don't know
what they done to me,
but l remember
it was horrible.
(DUKE GROANS)
They gave you what?
LSD.
JUDGE: Castration!
Double castration!
Where's my .357, man?
Who the fuck knows, man?
(CAR HORN HONKING)
You can't leave me alone
in this snake pit.
You bastard, what did you do
with my .357?
This room is in my name.
Well, tough titty.
Okay, goddamn it!
You're right.
She's my problem.
I'll call her,
I'll get her off our backs.
It's gone too fucking far.
Well, I'll take that
into consideration.
Relax.
Relax!
Let me handle this.
Where are my shoes?
The Americana Hotel.
What did you do
with my goddamn shoes?
Room 1 600, please.
As your attorney, I advise you
to take a hit out
of the little brown bottle
in my shaving kit.
You won't need much.
Just a tiny taste.
Let's have it.
Ah, there it is.
What is this shit?
That stuff
makes pure mescaline
seem like ginger beer, man.
Adrenochrome.
Adrenochrome? Hmm.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello.
Hi, Lucy. God bless.
Hmm?
Yeah, it's me.
Hell, no,
I taught the bastard a lesson
he'll never forget.
What? No, not dead.
But he won't be bothering
anybody for a while.
Yeah, I left him out there.
I stomped him.
I pulled all his teeth out.
DUKE NARRATING:
l remember thinking,
"Jesus.
"What a terrible thing
to lay on somebody
with a head full of acid."
But we have a problem.
That bastard cashed
a bad check downstairs
and gave you as a reference.
They'll be
looking for both of you.
Yeah, I know,
Lucy, but you can't
judge a book by its cover.
Some people are
just basically rotten.
Anyway, the last thing
in the world you wanna do
is call this hotel again.
They'll trace the call,
put you straight behind bars.
(BABBLING)
No, I'm moving
to the Tropicana right away.
Hmm.
I'll use a different name.
I'll let you know what it is.
I gotta get off.
Probably have this phone
tapped, baby.
Yeah, I know,
it was horrible,
but it's all over now.
(BANGING)
Oh, my God.
There's someone at the door.
(SQUEALING)
(WHISPERING)
There's someone at the door.
(BANGING)
Christ! Hey!
No! I'm innocent!
It was Duke!
It was Duke! Lucy! Lucy!
I love you ! I love you !
(SCREAMING)
Don't put that thing on me!
(SCREAMING)
Whoo. Oh.
Well. . .
That's that.
(GURGLING)
That's the last we should
be hearing from Lucy, man.
(EXHALES)
She's probably
stuffing herself down
the incinerator about now.
You know what we need?
We need some opium.
(GURGLING)
DUKE NARRATING: I remember
slumping on the bed.
His performance
had given me a bad jolt.
For a moment, l thought
his mind had snapped,
that he actually believed
he was being attacked
by invisible enemies.
But the room was quiet again.
Where'd you get this?
Never mind.
It's absolutely pure.
What kind of monster client
have you hooked up
with this time?
Satanism freak.
I think there's only
one source for this stuff,
the adrenaline gland
from a living human body.
I know.
The guy didn't have
any cash to pay me.
He offered me human blood,
said it would take me higher
than I'd ever been in my life.
I thought
he was kidding.
Oh.
So I told him I'd just
as soon have an ounce
or so of pure adrenochrome.
Or maybe just
a fresh adrenaline gland
to chew on.
DUKE NARRATING: I couId
already feel the stuff
working on me.
The first wave felt
like a combination
of mescaline and methedrine.
Maybe l should take a swim,
l thought.
Yes, sir.
They nailed this guy
for child molesting.
He swore he didn't do it.
"Why should I fuck
with children?" he said.
"They're too small."
(WHINING)
Christ, what could I say?
Even a goddamn werewolf
is entitled to legal counsel.
I didn't dare to
turn the creep down.
He might have
picked up a letter opener
and gone after my
pineal gland.
You know?
Yeah.
Crazy.
Why not?
Shit. We should get
some of that.
Just
eat a big handful
and see what happens.
Some of what?
(GRUNTING)
(SNIFFING)
Extract of pineal.
Sure, that's a good idea.
One whiff of that stuff
will turn you
into something
out of a goddamn
medical encyclopedia, man.
Beautiful fucking tits.
Man, your head would swell up
like a watermelon.
You'd gain about
1 00 pounds in two hours.
Right!
Grow claws, bleeding warts.
Yes.
And then you'd notice
about six huge, hairy tits
swelling up on your back.
Fantastic!
You'd go blind.
Your body would turn to wax.
They'd have to put you
in a wheelbarrow.
And when you scream for help,
you'll sound like a raccoon.
(WHIMPERING)
Man, I'll try
just about anything,
but I'd never in hell
touch a pineal gland.
Finish the fucking story, man !
What happened?
What about the glands?
Jesus, that stuff
got right on top of you,
didn't it?
Look at your face.
You're about to explode.
Maybe you could just
shove me into the pool.
Man, if I put you
in the pool right now,
you'll sink
like a goddamn stone.
You took too much, man.
You took too much. Too much.
(GURGLING)
Don't try and fight it.
You'll get brain bubbles,
strokes, aneurysms.
You'll just wither up
and die.
(DUKE MUTTERING INCOHERENTLY)
MAN ON T.V. : They continue
killing innocent people!
Allowing the hopes
for peace and freedom
of millions of people
to be suffocated.
So tonight, to you,
the great silent majority...
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
(ECHOING) Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
WOMAN:
l feel the cottonwood
whispering above
Tammy, Tammy
(MOANING)
Tammy's in love
DUKE NARRATING: What kind
of rat-bastard psychotic
would play that song
right now, at this moment?
Tammy, Tammy
When l came to,
the general back-alley
ambience of the suite
was so rotten,
so incredibly foul.
How long had l been
lying there?
All these signs of violence.
What had happened?
(INSECT BUZZING)
There was evidence
in this room of excessive
consumption
of almost every type of drug
known to civilized man
since 1 544 A.D.
(COUGHING)
Oh, ah, Debbie.
Thank God.
Oh, Debbie. Hmm? Look.
DUKE NARRATING:
What kind of addict would
need all these coconut husks
and crushed honeydew rinds?
Would the presence of junkies
account for all these
uneaten French fries?
These puddles of glazed
ketchup on the bureau?
Maybe so.
But then why all this booze
and these crude
pornographic photos
smeared with mustard
that had dried to a hard,
yellow crust?
These were not
the hoofprints of your
normal God-fearing junkie.
lt was too savage,
too aggressive.
GONZO: Put your hands
where I can see them.
What? What?
Jesus God, man. Huh?
Put your hands
where I can see them.
Put your hands
where I can see them !
(GROANS)
DUKE NARRATING:
Grim memories
and bad flashbacks.
Get a grip.
Maintain.
How many nights
and weird mornings
had this shit been going on?
(URINATING)
Something ugly had happened.
l was sure of it.
(RETCHING)
Who is that?
Oh. Shit, that's me.
(MUTTERING)
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
WOMAN: Help me!
The fuck!
What the fuck?
(GONZO YELLING)
Oh, shit.
(WOMAN YELLING)
You're under arrest!
She must have
used a pass key.
I was polishing my shoes
in the closet
when I noticed her
sneaking in, so I took her.
What made you do it?
Who paid you off?
Nobody! I'm the maid !
You're just as much
a part of it as they are.
Part of what?
The goddamn dope ring.
You must know
what's going on
in this hotel.
Why do you think we're here?
(STUTTERING)
I know you're the cops,
but I thought
you were just here
for the convention.
I swear. All I wanted to do
was clean up the room.
I don't know
anything about no dope.
Come on, baby.
Don't try to tell us
you never heard
of the Grange Gorman.
I swear to Jesus
I never heard of that stuff.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Maybe she's not part of it.
I swear I'm not. I swear.
In that case,
maybe she can help.
Oh, yes,
I'll help you all you want.
I hate dope.
So do we.
I think we should
put her on the payroll,
see what she comes up with.
You think
you can handle it?
What?
One phone call every day.
Don't worry
if it doesn't add up.
That's our problem.
You'd pay me for that?
You're damn right we would.
But the first time
that you say anything
about this to anybody
you will go straight to prison
for the rest of your life.
What's your name?
Alice.
Prove it!
Okay.
Just ring Linen Service
and ask for Alice.
All right, Alice.
You'll be contacted
by Inspector Rock,
Arthur Rock.
He'll be posing
as a politician,
but you'll have no problem
recognizing him.
That's right, Inspector Rock
will pay you in cash.
$1 ,000 on the ninth
of every month.
Oh, Lord ! I'd do just about
anything for that.
You and a lot
of other people.
Come here. The password is,
"One hand washes the other."
The minute you hear that,
you say, "I fear nothing."
Say it.
I fear nothing.
Say it again !
I fear nothing !
Very good.
Get the fuck out of here.
Oh, yeah, listen.
Nice meeting you.
Don't bother
to make up the room.
Just leave a pile of towels
and soap outside the door
exactly at midnight.
That way we won't
have to risk another
one of these
little incidents, will we?
Whatever you say, gentlemen.
Thank God for decent people.
DUKE ON TAPE: Say it again!
WOMAN: l fear nothing!
DUKE NARRATING:
Terrible gibberish.
Splintered memories looming up
out of the time fog.
Just press play.
DUKE ON TAPE: This is it,
the American Dream.
Shit!
We're sitting
on the main nerve right now.
Yeah, don't get me started.
The owner always wanted
to run away and join
the circus when he was a kid.
Now the son of a bitch
owns the circus.
Ah, man,
a real license to steal.
Oh, yeah.
The American Dream
come true, man.
Pure Horatio Alger.
Yeah. Welcome
to the happy place.
(GRUNTING)
Listen, let's get down
to brass tacks here.
How much for the ape?
MAN CHUCKLING:
How much you got?
DUKE ON TAPE:
How much do you think
you'd take for the ape?
Just wait here.
l'll be back.
DUKE NARRATING: Madness.
lt made no sense at all.
l desperately
needed the facts.
(DUKE YELLING)
(HARD ROCK MUSIC
PLAYING ON TAPE)
What the fuck is going on?
Where's the ape, man?
Where's the ape?
MAN: Forget about it.
He attacked an old man.
Bit off the head
of the bartender,
then the cops came
and took him away.
(GRUNTING)
Is that your car?
(SHOUTING)
Somebody stop them !
DUKE: You poor fools
don't understand, do you?
This car is property
of the World Bank.
That money goes to Italy.
You can't put on a circus
without a tent.
The top
is completely jammed.
You're right.
There's something wrong
with the motor.
We're all riders of the storm.
Where are you,
you fucking monkey?
You can't do that!
You people voted
for Hubert Humphrey.
And you killed Jesus.
DUKE: There was every reason
to believe that we'd been
heading for trouble,
that we'd pushed
our luck a bit too far.
Oh, gosh, shit! God !
Right. Uh. . .
The possibility
of physical
and mental collapse
is now very real.
No sympathy for the devil.
Keep that in mind.
Uh, buy the ticket. . .
Uh, take the ride.
(WEEPING)
Hey, there.
You folks want to
buy some heroin?
(GONZO WEEPING)
Hey, honkies! Goddamn it!
Pull ahead, will you?
I want to sell you
some pure fucking scag !
Cheap! The real stuff.
I just got back from Vietnam.
Scag.
I want to sell you
some pure fucking scag.
Shit! Fuck!
Now hear me, you bastard !
Pull over! I'll kill you !
MAN ON TAPE:
Pull over! Come on!
Oh, shit. Oh, oh.
(SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
Okay. Let's see here.
DUKE NARRATING:
The mentality of Las Vegas
is so grossly atavistic
that a really massive crime
often slips by unrecognized.
North Vegas is where
you go when you've fucked up
once too often on the Strip.
And when you're not
even welcome in the cut-rate
downtown places.
(SCREAMING)
The North Star Coffee Lounge
seemed like a fairly
safe haven from our storms.
No hassles, no talk.
Just a place to rest
and regroup.
l wasn't even hungry.
There was nothing
in the atmosphere
of the North Star
to put me on my guard.
Two glasses
of ice water with ice.
Two.
She looked like
a burnt-out caricature
of Jane Russell.
She was definitely
in charge here.
He did it very casually,
but l knew that our peace
was about to be shattered.
What was that?
What is this?
It's a napkin.
Don't give me
that bullshit.
I know what that means,
you fat goddamn pimp bastard !
That's the name of a horse
I used to own, ma'am.
What's wrong with you?
DUKE NARRATING:
The question mark
was emphasized.
WAITRESS: You listen to me,
you son of a bitch.
I gotta take a lot of shit
in this place,
but I don't have to
take it off no spic pimp!
Anybody that knows
anything knows that.
Go on ! Pay your check
and get out of here!
You want me to call the cops?
I'll call the fuck. . .
Oh, shit.
DUKE: Fuck.
Want me to call the cops?
(COUGHS)
How much is that
lemon meringue pie?
DUKE NARRATING: Her eyes
were turgid with fear,
but her brain was functioning
on some basic
motor survival level.
35 cents.
How much is that
lemon meringue pie?
35 cents.
Whoo! What a waste of talent.
No, honey,
I mean the whole pie.
The whole pie.
(GASPS)
Hmm?
What, three?
(SNIFFLING)
Three? Four?
Five? Hmm?
Five.
I'll be in the car.
The sight of the blade
had triggered bad memories.
The glazed look in her eyes
said her throat had been cut.
She was still in the grip
of paralysis when we left.
(CAR ENGINE REVVING)
(SOBBING)
DUKE NARRATING:
lt was all over now.
We'd abused every rule
that Vegas lived by.
Threatening the locals,
abusing the tourists,
terrifying the help.
The only chance now, l felt
was the possibility
that we'd gone to such excess
that nobody in the position
to bring the hammer
down on us
could possibly believe it.
Fifteen minutes to get
my attorney to the airport,
could we make it?
Christ!
No!
Oh, fuck!
Fuck.
Whoa, shit! Whoa, shit!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
You son of a bitch !
Oh, God.
(SCREAMING)
GONZO: You're going
the wrong way.
DUKE: The next left.
GONZO: Stop!
Go! Fuck!
Take a right here.
Take a right here.
GONZO: Goddamn it. We're lost.
What are we doing
out here on this
godforsaken road?
The airport's over there.
Goddamn it! It's over there.
I've never
missed a plane yet.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Hold on !
All right. I'm gonna drop you
right next to the plane.
Fuck you. I'm gonna
have to take the blame.
They'll crucify me.
Right here, right here.
Ridiculous, man.
Just say you were hitchhiking
to the airport,
and I picked you up.
You bastard.
Get out.
Hey, hey! Hey, listen.
Don't take any guff
from these swine.
If you have
any trouble, remember,
you can always send a telegram
to the right people.
Yeah, explaining my position.
Some asshole wrote
a poem about that once.
Probably good advice,
if you have shit for brains.
(GONZO LAUGHING)
DUKE NARRATING: There he goes.
One of God's own prototypes.
A high-powered mutant
of some kind
never even considered
for mass production.
Too weird to live,
(GRUNTING)
and too rare to die.
(SINGING) There you stood
on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
DUKE NARRATING:
We're all wired
into a survival trip now.
No more of the speed
that fueled the '60s.
That was the fatal flaw
in Tim Leary's trip.
He crashed
around America, selling
"consciousness expansion"
without ever giving a thought
to the grim
meat-hook realities
that were lying in wait
for all those people
who took him seriously.
All those pathetically
eager acid freaks
who thought they could
buy peace and understanding
for three bucks a hit.
But their loss and failure
is ours too.
What Leary took down with him
was the central illusion
of a whole lifestyle
that he helped create.
A generation
of permanent cripples,
failed seekers,
who never understood
the essential old-mystic
fallacy of the acid culture.
The desperate assumption
that somebody
or at least some force
is tending the light
at the end of the tunnel.
There was only one road
back to L.A.
U.S. lnterstate 1 5.
Just a flat out
high-speed burn through
Baker and Barstow and Berdoo.
Then onto
the Hollywood Freeway,
straight into
frantic oblivion,
safety, obscurity.
Just another freak
in the freak kingdom.
(SINGING) I was born
in a cross-fire hurricane
But l howled at my ma
in the driving rain
But it's all right now
ln fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
l'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas, gas, gas.
l was raised by a toothless,
bearded hag
l was schooled with a strap
right across my back
But it's all right now
ln fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
l'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas, gas, gas
l was drowned
l was washed up
and left for dead
l fell down to my feet
And l saw they bled
Yeah, yeah
l frowned
At the crumbs
of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
l was crowned
With a spike
right through my head
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But it's all right now
ln fact, it's a gas
But it's all right
l'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas, gas, gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash.
lt's a gas.
(SINGING) Bright Iight city
gonna set my soul
lt's gonna set my soul on fire
l got a whole lotta money
that's a-ready to burn
So get those stakes up high
There's a thousand
pretty women waitin' out there
They're all waitin'
The devil may care
And l'm just a devil
with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How l wish that
there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if l ran out of sleep
Boy, l wouldn't
sleep a minute away
Oh, there's blackjack
and poker
and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost
on every deal
All you need's a strong heart
and nerves of steel
So Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
where the neon signs
are flashing
And the one-armed
bandits crashing
All those hopes
down the drain
Viva Las Vegas
turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
lf you see it once
you'll never be the same again
l gotta keep on runnin'
Gonna have me some fun
lf it costs me
my very last dime
lf l wind up broke
then l'll always remember
That l had a swingin' time
Oh, l'm gonna give it
everything l've got
Lady Luck's with me,
Dice, stay hot
Got coke up my nose
to dry away the snot
So Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva, Viva
Las Vegas
Whee!
