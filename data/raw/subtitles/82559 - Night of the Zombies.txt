As a chemist, she's a
real pain in the neck...
...But she's amazing
in bed, trust my words.
- With those thighs of hers...
- Not even mentioning her breasts.
All readings are normal.
I think all these checks
are just a waste of time.
What the hell is going on?
This thing is acting crazy.
There must be some leakage
on the terminals.
That's what it looks like.
God, the meter is
going like crazy!
Activating the
anti-contamination system.
- It's not working! What's going on?
- Try with the emergency valve.
Stay back, it might
be dangerous.
- Look here, Lawson!
- What?
A dead rat, here in the most
sterile sector of the building.
That's incredible.
How did it get here?
Rooks, look out!
Rooks!
Rooks!
Rooks!
Rooks!
Rooks! Rooks!
Rooks!
My God!
- Emergency! Emergency!
- No, no...
Incident in the Antares module!
Repeat: incident in the Antares module!
Emergency!
Follow me!
Incident in the Antares module!
Emergency!
- Antares isn't answering!
- Try again, just try again!
It's useless, professor! The
circuits have gone wild!
- No answers.
- We're dead if we don't stop that leak!
We're all gonna die!
- Sector 1, answer!
- Sector 9, what's happening?
Emergency on "Sweet Death",
emergency on "Sweet Death".
Team I must protect the Antares
module at once. This is an order.
All access to it
must be guarded.
We have to isolate the
module at any cost.
Emergency! Incident in
the Antares module!
Emergency! I repeat, incident
in the Antares module!
Put your gas mask on, professor!
Emergency! Emergency!
Incident in the Antares module!
Emergency! I repeat, incident
in the Antares module!
Emergency!
Experimental project "Sweet Death"
must be considered an utter failure.
A sort of degenerative
process has begun...
...And it might lead to
unthinkable consequences for all.
May God forgive us.
Forgive us for
what's happening...
...And for what will
happen in the future.
Emergency! Emergency!
Incident in the Antares module!
Emergency!
Calling all cars: converge
near the residential zone...
...Ongoing terrorist attack
against the U.S. consulate.
I repeat, calling all
cars: converge near...
They've been in there for over an
hour and they're not doing anything.
They want to talk with the mayor and the
highest-ranking magistrate in the city.
That's all for now. Over.
Cars 5, 6 and 7, set up roadblocks
on entry zones to the area.
Cars 5, 6 and 7, set up roadblocks
on entry zones to the area.
To all units: remove all civilian residents
from the area near the consulate.
I repeat, remove all civilian residents
from the area near the consulate.
Where are the terrorists?
First or second floor?
Keep your head down!
Do you want to die?
These guys aren't joking!
Take cover!
Who are they? Palestinians,
Iranians, Iraqis or what?
So far we only know
they're good shots.
That's something.
Alright, guys.
First of all, we're going
to split into two groups.
You and Osborne will
attack from below.
Vincent and I will try to
surprise them from above.
Damn! This is just what
we needed right now!
But do we know who these
people are, at least?
Who do you think they are?
The usual bunch of terrorists.
Are we allowed to kill them all?
Sure, absolutely.
Be careful they don't blast
your nuts off first.
When did you start worrying
about our nuts, pops?
Personal interest. We're going
on a nice tropical vacation.
Where, exactly?
New Guinea. Happy?
What about the girls there?
Naked and wild.
Now listen, you bastards.
I've decided to waste everybody, but
I'm gonna give you one last chance.
I want a TV announcement
within ten minutes...
...Announcing the shutting down
of every Hope Center in the world.
I want the news officially
confirmed by the United Nations.
You've only got ten minutes,
so you better move fast!
Out!
Who are those guys?
- The special team is moving in.
- Get them.
Those dirty bastards are about
to get the lesson they deserve.
Keep shooting.
The terrorists who are currently holding
eight hostages in the U.S. consulate...
...Have sent their ultimatum
to the civil authorities.
Its contents have not been revealed and the
authorities are maintaining strict silence.
- What's the situation?
- Lt. London is ready, sir.
- Use the tear gas to give him some cover.
- Yes, sir.
Freeze! Drop your gun.
We still haven't received any
details concerning the ultimatum.
Speculations have linked it to an
ecological message of some sort...
...But the terrorists haven't been
connected with any known group.
Here's a brief recap
of the events.
Yes.
We're now ready to go live to show the
police besieging the U.S. consulate.
Police and special forces have formed an
impenetrable barrier around the building.
Snipers using the most advanced weapons
have been placed at strategic points.
Now the terrorists will know they
cannot escape police...
...And that they'd better give up their
brutal threat of a useless carnage.
- I'll kill you all!
- Down! Hit the floor!
- Get down! Hurry!
- Hit the floor!
You'll never make it out alive...
I swear, you'll never make it!
Quick! The window!
I'm gonna kill you all!
You're all doomed to die anyway!
You're all selfish! A
bunch of selfish pigs!
You know nothing because you
refuse to know anything!
We're all doomed to die.
Doomed to die in the
most horrible way.
Killed... And then devoured.
Yes. Devoured.
Devoured by our brothers.
Eagle calling base.
Eagle calling base.
We've ended in some huge
graveyard for the Papua natives.
Twenty miles east of Goroka.
Awaiting further instructions.
Over.
Hey, Santoro, look at that one.
He looks just like you
sitting on the loo.
We can compare. I really
feel like taking a leak.
Eagle calling base.
Eagle calling base.
The sun is hammering down and I don't
like it. I'm gonna be pretty pissed...
...If you don't tell us how to
get out of this damn valley!
Over.
"Patience is the first virtue
of those who have faith."
Mahatma Gandhi, New Delhi, 1946.
"Fuck it". Lt. Mike London,
Shit Valley, 1980.
Hey, Vincent!
Where are all those wild and
naked women you promised me?
What about the one
in front of you?
I know, she hasn't got makeup
on, but she's a devil in bed.
No, thanks.
She's a little too
meaty for my tastes.
No, thanks.
Eagle calling base.
Eagle calling base.
If you don't give us any coordinates to get
out of here, we'll do it by ourselves.
Well, I guess we can say this operation
has been perfectly organized.
The airport was deserted,
not even a single local guide...
...And in order to move around
we had to steal this wreck.
Actually, we didn't steal it.
We borrowed it.
You deaf bastards, I'm about
to explode down here!
Over.
I wonder how long these
folks have been dead.
It might be centuries.
It's the climate of the valley
that preserves them so well.
It's a bit like
vacuum-packed coffee.
This will be my final message.
Answer if you read me. Over.
Ok! All ready to get
behind the wheel!
It's useless. No
one is answering.
- Let's go, Osborne.
- A moment and... Ready to go!
Be careful. It's
still hurting him.
My God! My God!
This damn wound is
still suppurating!
The infection keeps
getting worse.
And we didn't bring
any medicine with us!
Maybe we could find
some water here.
Sure, what a bright idea!
Dragging a seven-year-old
kid through this shit!
Only you could've had
an idea like this!
Who could have predicted we'd have
found ourselves in this hell?
Sure! Let's pretend we
are a modern couple!
Of course we can't be so
old-fashioned to leave our kids...
...At some convent school
or with a babysitter!
Of course, not bringing the kid
along with us would be too bad.
It doesn't matter that he's being
eaten alive by mosquitoes!
Or that he's been attacked
by some crazy native!
Don't start again
with that, please!
Sure, it's easy for you!
The great Lia Rousseau can't
be bothered to listen...
...To the pathetic complaints
of a worried father!
After all, she's a reporter...
An idol for the viewers who can never
get enough blood and violence!
Fine. Go screw yourself!
We're going to get some water.
Hey, Lia.
What's up with you?
I want to take your picture. You haven't
gotten a single close-up since we arrived.
I need to get some air.
Yes, I understand. Go ahead.
Give me the boy. I'll hold him.
You go.
- Mom... Mom...
- I won't be long, honey.
Father. Father.
Father. Father!
Is something wrong, father?
Some water, at last!
- I could dive right in.
- Why don't you?
Well... I prefer to focus
on the lovely nymph...
...Who's about to quench
my ancient, eternal thirst.
Do you really want
to shoot this, too?
You're the star. And this will
be your best reportage to date.
My camera is at your service.
Have you seen the way they walk?
I don't understand how
many of them there are.
God, Pierre. They
look like monsters.
Maybe they're just drunk.
Maybe lepers. They could
be friendly people.
I don't know. I don't think
we should trust them.
Everything seems to
be fine from here.
- Look there, near that hill.
- Could be shacks.
And that other thing
looks like a car.
Then there's people there.
Let's go investigate, guys.
Maybe we'll find some
tanga-clad tourists.
Or maybe they won't
be even wearing it.
What are we going to do?
They don't have any weapons.
I reckon we can
make a run for it.
- Come on, then!
- Let's go!
Run, come on!
What is this place?
It looks like an
abandoned mission.
What about those two?
Help! Help us!
- Help us! - What's going on?
- We're being chased! - Thanks goodness!
Some weird things
are chasing us!
They came out of there!
- Santoro, Osborne, go take a look.
- Let me take my rifle.
Move your butt, you little jerk!
Here we are, no hurries. It's not
like there's a war on, right?
Christ... Look in the car.
Wait! Silent!
Go!
But... Who the hell is that?
No!
I'll handle this myself!
Seven lives like a cat!
Josette?
Josette?
Josette, are you here?
Josette!
Josette!
Hold it!
You have to destroy their head.
The woman. Where is she?
Josette!
Josette!
Lia!
The head!
It's all over.
Yes. It's all over.
The news received from Papua
New Guinea have been sketchy.
Some sources described incidents
involving cannibalism...
...But the local
government has denied this.
Antoine is waiting for you at the RVM.
He says it's important.
The Red Cross will make a thorough
investigation on these incidents...
...In order to avoid
a public outcry.
Seems like a whole lot of
things are happening there.
She didn't mention the Hope
Center incident, though.
What happened at the U.S. consulate
only confirms our suspicions.
And seeing these people,
scared out of their wits...
...It's just further proof of
what's happening down there.
In their last ultimatum,
the terrorists demanded...
...The dismantling of every Hope Center,
but the media didn't talk about it.
At this point, we've gone
beyond idle speculation.
In those centers, they're working
on something close to a genocide.
If Lia can get to the Hope Center first...
...We could be the first to cover
what seems to be a major catastrophe.
Yes. Possibly, a
catastrophe so great...
...We won't even have the
chance to report it to anyone.
In order to reach the river...
...We have to pass through a village
approximately ten miles away from here.
By the way, what are we gonna do
with the two French reporters?
We'll leave them at the
first settlement we find.
Maybe even that village
you mentioned.
Don't worry. They'll make it.
I seemed to understand that
she's some hotshot reporter.
Another reason to get rid of
them as soon as possible.
Journalist are big snoopers...
...And we can't have her risking to
compromise our mission. Understand?
That must be the path
leading to the village.
Well, what are we waiting for?
I don't like the sound
of those drums.
I wouldn't fancy ending up roasted
with an apple in my mouth.
Yeah. It seems like they're
excited over something.
I hope you won't shit
yourselves over a few savages.
Even a tank division would have
a hard time in this jungle.
Every tree could hide a trap.
Every bush could hide a danger.
These people grew
up in the jungle.
They're silent, and
they're quick.
You seem very knowledgeable
about this kind of stuff, lady.
Lia knows the local
customs very well.
She lived with a tribe
for almost a year.
Quite brave.
Very interesting. What do
you suggest we should do?
There's only one thing to do.
Only one.
I have to go alone now. Join me in
an hour and don't use your weapons.
What's he up to?
I don't know, but the hour is up
and the drums sound different.
Let's get into the village.
The village is infected. They're
celebrating many funerals.
They think we're here to help.
Help? Help them to do what?
Nothing. But let's make
sure they don't realize it.
Cheers.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Don't you feel well?
I feel great, I'm
just a little tipsy.
- Would you do me a favor?
- If I can.
Could you stop with all
these formal manners?
You military guys all act alike.
When a soldier has to complete a
mission, he's got no room for sappiness.
What's happening
in this country?
Why is nature so suddenly
revolting against us?
Unthinkable things like the dead coming
back to life and eating human flesh...
The moon, the sky, the water...
Everything seems to be contaminated.
And you guys arriving from nowhere
for who knows what mission.
You're a journalist
with much imagination.
We're on a humanitarian mission
under military secrecy. That's all.
Top secret, right?
The world is falling apart...
The tombs are opening
their doors...
The dead are devouring
the living...
And everything is still
under military secrecy.
Maybe the consequences of this disaster
have been generated from a military secret.
Something top secret.
Something top secret
like those Hope Centers.
Right?
Quick, get in the car!
Damn you!
Back to the jeep, hurry!
Let's break through!
My God.
Those natives can't possibly
understand what's going on.
They are all going to die.
They'll let their
faith destroy them.
I've got a suggestion
for those savages...
...A nice bonfire to
burn everything down.
They'd rather be devoured
than burn their dead.
Too bad for them, then.
What's up with you?
Why the long face?
The woman. She asks
a lot of questions.
I think she suspects us.
We need to get rid of her
as soon as possible.
You dirty son of a bitch!
I can't believe it! This
damn engine is gone!
Unload our stuff. We'll
use the Land Rover.
- Damn it...
- Alright guys, let's get going.
- Give me that bag.
- Be careful, it's pretty heavy.
Unload everything. We're only
taking what's necessary.
Wait for me, guys! This
stuff weighs a ton!
Hold on. We have something very
important here and I am not leaving it.
We have to fit in there, and there won't
be enough space with all that baggage!
Come on! Let's do it!
We are not leaving our stuff,
whether you like it or not...
...Those documents are too important and
we're not dumping them in the jungle!
You're starting to irritate me, kid.
You don't want to get me angry.
You dirty bastard!
You son of a bitch!
You had enough or you
want me to carry on, kid?
You leave him now or I'll
shoot, I swear to God.
You guys don't move an inch.
You think I won't have the guts to
shoot you because I'm a woman...
...I should warn you that you
wouldn't be the first man I've killed.
- That'd be the one who tried to rape me.
- Let's talk.
Freeze right there. Don't
move, you asshole.
You too! Another move and you can
bid goodbye to your general!
And don't get me nervous, or my
finger might slip on the trigger.
Now calm down and listen
to me, I don't...
No! You listen, you
bunch of pigs!
We let you ride in our vehicle instead
of leaving you in the jungle...
...And you even want us to dump
everything we've worked for.
That's the only thing that'd
give this trip any meaning...
...Or have you forgotten the eyes of the
kid when he was eating his father's flesh?
That's something
I'll never forget.
Unless this whole documents thing is a
trick...
...Something to hide
your real intentions.
You actually wanted to get rid of us, like
we were some excess load slowing you down.
Isn't that right, Mr.
God Almighty?
Fine. I reckon we're going to do the
exact opposite of what you had in mind.
All of you, drop your weapons.
Quick!
Do what she says, boys.
Here, London!
Let's take them to the first
populated area. Then, we'll see.
What a heart of gold.
- Come on, get on your feet.
- I'll get up by myself!
I don't need any help.
Don't forget the guns, Osborne.
Hey, madame...
It was empty! Bang!
- Calm down, don't scream. It's Vincent.
- What now?
Your cigarette is too
visible in this darkness.
Okay, commander. I'll
put it out right now.
- Here, try this.
- What is it?
Chewing tobacco. It's very
good once you get into it.
You're right.
I was waiting for a chance to tell you
that I don't hold anything against you.
Well, thanks very much.
But then I thought
it was no use...
...No use telling you that maybe you
see us worse than we actually are.
It's the situation we are in
that forces us to act like this.
Suppose we'd met
in the middle of London...
...And liked each other.
- Perhaps we'd have ended in bed together.
- That's your opinion.
I don't think of myself as a
Casanova or, worse, a playboy...
...But in a normal situation you're
the kind of girl I'd really like.
Sure. Another name
for your archive.
I knew it. I knew you'd have
taken it too seriously.
Now I have to offer you a glass
of champagne. You pick the brand.
You damn idiot! This is
your turn on guard duty!
I'm going to become real angry.
Santoro, take the guns, the
canteen and come with me.
We're going to look for water
near the end of the trail.
You be ready in case
anything happens.
The boss went out and
left his soldiers here...
- Hey, London.
- What?
I've noticed some tracks
on the ground. Blood.
And bits of flesh.
Noticed it too.
Let's keep our eyes peeled.
It seems quiet here.
No sign of those things.
Christ. Look at that.
God, it's horrible.
That guy. How did
he end up there?
Come on, Santoro, let's
get out of here. Move!
Quick, start the car! We
gotta get out of here!
The jungle is full of those things!
Let's go!
- What do you... - What's happening?
- They're coming! There's a lot of them!
Christ! Just what we needed!
I finally got a
chance to film them!
- Where do you think you're going?
- Let go of me!
This is too good an
opportunity to waste it.
Pierre! Pierre!
Pierre! Don't go!
Pierre!
Pierre!
Pierre! Come back, Pierre!
God, he must have gone out of his mind!
He'll get killed if he gets any closer!
We've got to do something!
Come on. Hold still
for a nice close-up.
- Start the car.
- I won't leave him.
- What about him?
- I told you to start the car! - Pierre!
- Pierre! Pierre!
- Don't worry.
We've got to get out of
here before they attack us!
- Pierre!
- Stop it!
Lia!
Shit!
Come on, Vincent, let's try
to hit the first ones.
To hell with this rifle!
Who's dumber? The guys with shit all over
their faces, or the ones on their knees?
- You talk like that because you're scared.
- Who's scared? Me?
Of course! I think you're
crapping your pants!
Fine.
Okay. You keep the engine
of this wreck running.
I'll be right back.
Enough! You leave my
friends alone, got it?
They've got the brain of an animal, and
I'm the only one who can deal with them!
Beat it!
Come on. Let's move, quick.
- Let's go, you idiot!
- Wait a minute!
Fuck you!
Come on! Get me!
Come and get me!
Come on! Come on, you shitheads!
Come on! Get a move!
Come on, attack me! I'm
here just for you!
Come on!
Get a move! There's plenty
of you and I'm all alone!
Come on! Attack me!
Don't be scared!
Santoro! What the fuck are you doing?
Come here!
An army of assholes!
No soul and no mind!
They've really got you!
They stole your brain!
You're just like plants now!
Plants with flesh and bones!
You shitheads!
Santoro, use your damn brain!
Come here!
Hey, you shithead.
Why are you looking
at me like that?
You'd like to eat
me, wouldn't you?
He's gone crazy. He's
talking to those things.
Yeah, sure. Which bit
would you prefer?
Drumstick or wing?
Wing it is. Very good, my friend...
Take your bit!
In a few days, this area will
become a trail for tanks.
They're gonna need so many of
those to clean up the country.
To hell with tanks.
They need bombs.
A big neutron bomb. One big boom and
we start over with a clean sheet.
I'd rather listen to the radio
than keep hearing your bullshit.
The gas cloud has expanded.
There's no hope left.
Three provinces. Somewhere else
the situation is falling apart.
Communication breakdown has
been going on for days...
...Thus not allowing an accurate
appraisal of these dramatic events.
Several well-known European scientists
have minimized the situation.
America and Russia have been accusing
each other on the issue of...
...Some experiments where biological
weapons have apparently been used.
The security council of the United
Nations has met for a special session...
...At the request of the U.N.
secretary-general.
The meeting failed to produce any
specific strategy to follow right now.
- Solve everything yourself, then!
- You're not thinking! - That's enough!
We have to burn the bodies!
Please, there's another
serious matter to discuss!
Our fellow countrymen are
fleeing through the nation.
...Crowds of bewildered people, scared
and angered by what's happening!
We need to do
something for them!
You have destroyed my people.
You have slaughtered them!
You have made them a crowd of human larvae,
a crowd of prehistoric creatures...
...A crowd of hyenas, of thirsty beasts!
A crowd of horrible monsters!
A bullet to the head is the
only way to stop them.
Let's hear what the chief
of police has to say.
As far as the wandering crowds are
concerned, with the help of the army...
...We've devised a plan to cut off
the regions north of Port Moresby.
I will say again that our most serious
issue is the need to burn the bodies.
Any person who dies has to be
burned within two hours of death...
...Before they can turn into
the monsters we all know.
In order to do this, we
need police intervention.
Well-armed squads equipped
with flamethrowers...
...Ready to take the bodies from
the families trying to hide them.
Now that you ordered the apocalypse, now
that you ordered the end of it all...
...Nothing and no one
could revert things back!
I understand how you feel, but
well-informed sources told us...
...That the situation is under control
of the U.N. peacekeeping forces.
The country is getting
back to normal.
Of course, it will take some time
to make the wandering population...
...Return to their now
non-infected villages.
Enough with these lies!
You... You all know what my
people are really running from.
They're running from their children,
their mothers, their brothers...
...Who all turned into bloodthirsty
creatures that devour human flesh!
And they don't have the
strength to defend themselves!
Brother will eat
brother and so on...
...Going deep into
a bottomless pit...
...Until every inch of earth will be
dry, putrid and soaked with blood!
- It's getting late, goodbye.
- Goodbye, Your Excellency.
- Down you go!
- Damn!
Damn it! I don't
like these pranks!
Come on, let's check that house.
- Here, you take this.
- Thanks very much.
Do you smell this stink?
- Osborne.
- Huh?
- Take a look in the cellar.
- Yes, on it.
We'd better split up in order to
take a better look of the place.
I'll go upstairs.
Vincent, Santoro,
you take the rest.
Whoa.
It looks like some
bigshot lived here.
Hey!
I'm leading, ok?
If only there was something
to eat in this shithole.
That came from the cellar!
Let's go!
Wait here, Lia.
God! No!
My God!
Damn you!
You damn butchers!
They're eating him
like some damn pigs!
My God! My God!
Lia! Lia!
You damn bastards!
Out! Get out, you filthy beasts!
Out! Damn you, out!
They're coming!
Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Bastards! You bastards!
Close your eyes, Lia!
There's too many of them!
- I'm running out of ammo!
- Shoot! Keep shooting!
Let's go!
They're all over the place!
Let's get out of here! Quick!
Pierre, the door!
Christ! This is harassment!
They're coming!
Do something! I can't
hold it anymore!
- Vincent!
- You're here!
Move it!
- Take it!
- Do something!
Stay calm, guys.
Old Santoro will handle this.
I'll take care of these pigs.
I can't hold it anymore!
Move! Move!
Move!
Come on, you dumb vegetables!
Come and get it!
Come on!
So? You're not hungry?
Come and get it!
Come on, you rotten
piles of flesh!
You dirty bastards!
You guys get the
fuck out of here!
Come on, you bunch
of hungry bastards!
What is it? You've
lost your appetite?
Don't you like getting
a good meal like me?
So? Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Come on!
Everybody in the car, quick!
So? Who wants a piece of me?
You're disappointed? You got
this one wrong, you beasts!
We're gonna meet again in Hell!
Santoro can't do it on his own.
Last time, he did.
What's he doing?
Vincent, get his guns. Quick.
- Santoro, get away! Quick!
- Go away! Go away!
Go back to Hell!
Let's go, guys!
- Start it! They're coming!
- What the fuck is wrong with this?!
No!
- Vincent, the window!
- You damn animals!
Do something!
- Hurry, London!
- Do something!
- What the fuck are you doing, Mike?
- They'll kill us all!
It got stuck!
For God's sake, London!
Start the car!
- There's the river.
- Yeah.
This means...
...We are near the end
of this fucking trip.
Once we get down there,
we'll get a boat.
Then, completing our mission
will be a piece of cake.
What about the French reporters?
We'll take them with us.
Leaving them here would
be like a death sentence.
We're soldiers, not murderers.
Look down there, it's full
of those damn things!
Come on. Let's get moving.
Come on, guys. Get the dinghy
motor and some necessities.
From now on, it's every
man for himself.
- Do you know about navigation, Santoro?
- I was thirteen my first time sailing!
- I knew you were a sea dog! - Let's move.
- Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
Hey, we've got visitors.
Try to get us now, assholes!
Mike, wait. What's your plan?
I don't have one.
First of all, let's see
if the coast is clear.
One thing is for sure: if we're gonna get
inside, we've got to stick together.
Let's go.
That way.
This is where the elevator to the
upper levels is supposed to be.
Good. I'll go take a look.
You come with me, frenchie.
This is where it all
started, right?
Be quiet!
Okay. Let's go.
- Here it is. Go tell the others.
- Yes.
- That way.
- Let's go, Lia.
Who's there?
- What is it?
- I heard some funny noises that way.
Get back. Get back!
Pierre!
Why? Why?
You filthy things!
Die, you son of a bitch!
Monsters! You are monsters!
You're the Devil's spawn, but
I'll send you back to Hell!
I'm gonna kill you all!
You won't get me! You won't...
Santoro! Santoro!
Hurry, we need to
find another way!
Let's get away from here!
Come on! Move!
Keep your eyes peeled.
- Vincent, help!
- You motherfucker!
Die! Die!
Let's go...
We have to keep going...
Get me up.
Let go of me! Wait here.
Experimental project "Sweet Death"
must be considered an utter failure.
A sort of degenerative
process has begun...
...And it might lead to
unthinkable consequences for all.
May God forgive us.
Forgive us for
what's happening...
...And for what will
happen in the future.
The cloud is
spreading everywh...
What is it?
All these advanced machinery.
A futuristic factory...
...Built in a remote island,
away from the rest of the world.
Just like this place.
Now I can piece together all
the pieces of the puzzle.
What are you talking about?
They're called Hope. They're centers of
chemical research for the good of mankind.
To help Third World
countries, they said.
Instead, they invented a
system to permanently end...
...The biggest issue faced by
the industrialized countries.
The overpopulation of the world.
Dispose of the weak, of the
helpless, of the most numerous...
...In the most horrible way.
By making them
devour each other.
Professor, there's been a lot of talk
lately on some unexplained events...
...Taking place all around the world.
Could you tell us some more?
I can't tell you much, as our
inquiry has just started.
Earlier today, at the
university morgue...
...We were about to examine a corpse
whose limbs had been amputated.
A few minutes out of the cold
chamber, he opened his eyes.
He was dead. Yet, he opened
his eyes and started to move.
He wasn't dead, then?
- From the pathological point of v...
- Crazy talk.
That's pure science fiction.
Come on, let's go.
- The dead coming back to life? Bullcrap!
- They're all crazy.
A sort of deep coma...
Come on, let's go.
Are we gonna do it?
- What's the rush?
- Come on...
I want you.
- Let's go home.
- Mine or yours?
- Well?
- Don't insist. Our own places.
- Great, you ruined everything.
- I give up now, you won't marry me.
- Could you give me a light?
- No.
Whatever. I'll ask that
old guy over there.
- He's probably nicer than you.
- Leave him alone. He's just some old man.
Can't you see he's asleep?
- Wait, I'll give you a light.
- Too late, you missed your chance before.
Sir? Sir?
