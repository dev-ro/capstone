Stop whistling you dumb-ass!
Can't you see we're working here?
Hello Sakir! How's it going?
Remzi! How are things with you?
Cicek Abbas says that
troubles are many
Situation is grim due to poverty
Without the minibus dad
won't allow to marry
Either I have you or I die!
So what if he has a minibus?
They fixed you up with that creep Sakir
I'll fill your world with ﬂowers
Give me that car and save Abbas

Get out of my way!
Don't open that door.
Get out of here.

Welcome Nazli how are you?
Nazli! Nazli! Listen!
Why didn't you warn me?
Nazli! I swear to you I am innocent!
Nazli! Nazli! Listen to me!
She had her eye on me. She threatened
me and forced me to go up to the hill.
I swear on Abbas' body!
Before I knew what happened
we found ourselves on the hill.
Isn't that right Abbas?
In her ways but she didn't listen.
God knows how long she's been after me.
Isn't that right Abbas? She was like crazy.
Cross my heart and hope to die
if I'm lying!
These women are like that. ..
It was fate that I ran into a real psycho.
Nazli Just listen to me for a minute.
Forgive this guy! Spare him this time!
He made a big ass of himself!
Don't shout.
Speak softly everyone's hearing you!
Anyone can make a mistake forgive him!
Okay he is an asshole.
Don't shout.
He's a typical Jerk but no matter!
You disgraced me in front of everyone.
My dearest don't believe a word he says.
This one is finished. Bring me more!
Don't yell!
Tell that girl to never cross my path!
Make her pay one of these days!
There! There! my boy don't get angry.
No worriesi I'm controlling my anger.
Don't get so angry!
Shut up you bastard!
She'll have hell of a time
finding someone like me.
She cannot find.
I'll say I told you so. When she comes
crawling back tomorrow. ..
... I will give her two quick slaps
and tell her to disappear from my presence.
Son of a bitch! Bastard! Worthless crap! Where the hell do you
find guys like that? You shut up or I'll rip out your tongue!
If he's ﬂirting tarts why am I guilty?
I knew it he was stringing her along!
We've become laughing stock of everyone.
God damn it at least he had a minibus.
Come on brother don't worry about it! There are
plenty of men for me! Don't worry about it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Who are you ﬂirting with???
You know! There is so much for me and you! No

I swear she will beg to have me back.
I shouldn't forgive her rig ht?
I wouldn't forgive her.
Don't talk you fucker!
Ok I won't talk!
But I know she'll want her man back.

seat is always Ms Nazli's.
Hey we leaving or what!
Ok let's take off!
Flower, are you in love or what?
'FOR SALE'
Do you think it is easy to buy a minibus?
Your savings won't be enough.
And now you are going to a loanshark?
He'll rob you blind.
Can you afford the interest payments?
I'll work and pay it off.
Won't be able to pay.
Because that piece of shit won't run.
I'll fix it up.
I can repair it I am sure.
Why the hell are you doing all this?
The license plate will be in my name.
Ok.
I have prepared a payment plan for you.
Ok.
Don't say Ok to everything!
I'll repo the car if you miss a payment.
Ok.
Don't forget I'll take it if you skip.
I'll pay don't worry.
You talk needless.
Let's do the business. Right, Mustafa?
Told him it was shit, he didn't listen.
Bravo Bravo Long live Abbas!

I can drive you around or take you home.
That would be great.
Still can't believe it. Is this really yours?
Yes of course. I worked hard for it.
Thank you for bringing me.
No problem anytime.
Ford wasn't moving so I told off the driver.
Four people got out of the car.

That's right friends, I got the minibus!
From now on it will serve this route!
Tea for everybody on me!
You're the man Abbas!
I don't want any!
Okay. No tea for Sakir.
What the hell you mean by Sakir?
Have you changed your name?
You have balls call me Sakir!
Should I call you Mahmut instead?
Call me ML, Uncle, or Lord Sakir! Those
days are over Sakir! Exactly what it means!
Now that I have a minibus
we're brothers, Sakir.

Payments 40.00050.000.
All for you Nazli

You're older than me you start!
If your love is far away
Step on gas to play!
Anything for the lover
Bye to the hater
You the setting sun
Me longing for fun
Driver has a bad fortune.
The assistant is a broken heart
Gas, break, gear never bow to fear!
Love me and I'll love you.
Love is a bus if you know
how to get in once
But be wise and get off before the
bus dies Who are you to show off to?
Stay away from my wind
not to regret.
Don't you pass me or I'll pass you.
It's not my fault life has many thorns!
Don't tailgate or pass me and be sorry!
Suffer my suffering laugh at my fortune.
They refused me because I am a driver.
Efforts never ending god give me strength.
Hang on a second!
Love is like water that drives you crazy.
Love brings heartache and sorrow!
Not your fault but mine for loving you.
Abbas! Abbas!
Did you like the movie? Not really!
He got famous all of a sudden.
Then he went to desert for his love.
It doesn't make any sense.
Yeah but...
our love is also like that too.
I remember grandmother's stories.
Never a happy ending for the lovers.
So it must be the way all the time.
Let's sit here.
What is this?
It is a shoe.
It's a ﬂower. I made it.
Like it?
Yes
One wants to be loved like the movies.
It only happens in movies.
How do you know? Perhaps it exists.
Do you have a lover back in the village?
No. I did. . Ran off with someone else.
And you?
No.
What about Sakir?
I never loved him! He didn't either.
Yes he did.
Forget about it. You can always tell!
You can tell?
Yes.
Really?
A woman does.
Totally understands it?
Completely!
You don't say!
At least I understand.
What's wrong?
A fishbone
is caught in my throat.
Are you OK?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
No decency is left around here!
What's she doing in a single man's car?
That's a real shame.
This is a Muslim neighborhood.
Answer me!
What is it to you?
What do you mean?
Are you the moral cop of this place?
What is it to you anyway? Let's say he
loves me. And let's say I also love him.
Yeah lets say.
No lets not!
And he is gonna ask for my hand.
That's right he's going to. What?
Rig ht, he's going to.
Lets go Abbas!
Okay let's go!
Won't let you go!
Over my dead body!
We'll Just have to run him over!
Come see if you're a man!
Stop. What the fuck. Abbas.
I said stop. Get away!
Step aside so we can see.
Hush!
So how is everything going?
Everything is good.
Ask already!
Don't rush god damn you!
Listen Ihsan, you know why we're here!
My daughter did tell me a little.
Abbas is like a brother.
I'll vouch for him.
A virtuous, decent, hardworking man.
What does he do?
I own a minibus.
It's not easy supporting a family.
Thank god I do OK.
How much do you earn a day?
I'm able to save 5000 a day.
Good that's real good.
Before god with all due respect
we want to ask for your daughter's hand.
Do we have your blessings?
What can I say? OK!
Sister dad Just allowed.
Let me see!
Mustafa thanks. Thank you dad!
Brother! Brother! Brother!
Hasn't spoken since he heard about Nazli.
Brother! Brother!
Not talking at all!
Come on brother can I at least have a sip?
You heard him he said go ahead!

Just went crazy I guess.
Let's see where he goes.
Forgive them brother! Don't hurt them.
Don't separate those two.
Nazli.
Nazli.
The murderer is back! Brutal killer!
How did you do it? Have you no pity?
You shattered their dreams.
That's rig ht.
I did I tore out their lungs.
What kind of lungs are these?
Idiot. These are not lungs but an engine. What
engine? Mom! He killed them and took their engine.
Jackass! What murder? Abbas is finished.
He is a dead duck now.
He'll never be able to pay his debt.
He won't if you don't tell him.
If you speak I'll tear out your tongue.
You got it?
If you speak I'll tear out your tongue.

What is wrong?
Minibus is gonel Tires, engine, and all.
Should have gone to the police!
I did.They're going to investigate.
What are we going to do now?
I don't know
Worst part is payments are due.
I'm screwed if I don't find money fast.
Dear Abbas I waited but it didn't happen.
So?
So I told you before giving the money.
You don't have a rich dad or money saved.
I'll find a Job and pay you back.
Nothing you find will be enough to pay me.
Don't have tires or an engine.
How are you going to do it?
I am really desperate rig ht now.
Desperation does not feed me though!
It's not Just you. There are many others.
Do you want me to starve Abbas?
So kick me, no problem.
I have had a hard life ever since birth.
Listen Abbas! You'll suffer if I sue you.
Doing you a favor the title is in my name.
Your payments won't buy a set of wheels.
Fate has a sick sense of humor.
That I'm sure of.
You told me you had a minibus!
Yes and I did!
You didn't tell me you owed on it?
Dad! What can you buy without borrowing?
Nazli! Nazli!
