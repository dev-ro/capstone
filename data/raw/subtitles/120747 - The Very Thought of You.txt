Good morning.
- Morning.
I'd like to introduce myself
I'm your neighbour from the upstairs.
Laurence
How do you do.
- How do you do.
It's five-thirty in the morning.
And I have also lived here for
Thirty years now.
Well, welcome.
- Thank you.
Was there anything else?
- Cup of tea would be nice.
Cup of tea?
How are we gonna do this?
Are you gonna ask questions
or do I just talk?
Whichever you prefer.
That's the couch, right?
- The sofa, yes.
Do I sit or do I lie?
What do most people do?
- Most people sit.
Right.
I want to talk about love,
friendship and deceit.
I want to talk about the
fact that up until three days
ago there were three
people, friends, best friends
since our first day at school.
Frank, Daniel and me.
We just looked out for each other
or at least I looked out for them.
That's the way it's always been.
Anyway, three people
whose lives were okay.
Not perfect, but okay.
But that was three days ago.
Daniel was in the States
finalising some record deal
and was on his way home.
Mate, what can I say? You rock, mate.
I'm very excited. Chuck, we'll speak.
Bye.
He's this hotshot executive in the
music business, you know the type.
Re-invented the seventies
single-handed. Only flies
first class. Hits on every
good-looking woman in sight.
Which always leads
to problems with Frank.
Frank... What can I
tell you about Frank?
He's a penniless, out of
work actor, consumed with
envy for Daniel and I'm
the one stuck in the middle.
There'd been some competition
over a french actress.
And Frank wouldn't stop talking about
it on the way to dinner that night.
Nicky the agent calls me up, right.
She's got this French actress coming over
from Paris, so she's throwing this big
dinner party in her honour. She needs men.
So she wants me to bring Daniel
cos she's read some article
in some bloody magazine about
how bloody eligible he is.
Right, so we get to
this restaurant and this
French actress is like
this bombshell right?
So, Nicky takes me! And places me next
to bombshell woman, place of honour.
And conversation through the evening
is really flowing like a river, you know.
And it turns out that
she has got this break in
her schedule coming up
the following weekend
and she wants me to give her a call.
So, next day, I give her a call.
No reply. Day after that,
give her a call, no reply.
Next day, Nicky phones me
up to tell me that bombshell
woman has gone to Venice
with bloody Daniel!
Now, answer me a question. Is
that the behaviour of a friend?
Cos I tell you the only reason he was
interested is cos I was interested.
Frank, don't be so paranoid.
What'll you have?
So, I try and convince myself that the stuff
you always go on about, how we're the
closest friends we'll ever have'.
And you wanna know the truth?
I hate him!
I hate him, he hates me. There's
a pleasing kind of symmetry to it.
Both hate each other with the
kind of commitment you only get
from childhood friends. Next time
I see him I'm gonna break his nose.
Break his nose, then break his bloody
jaw Jesus Christ! You know the true...
He went on and on in the
way that only Frank can.
The acting in him was getting him
down. He hadn't worked in years.
And he was in a bad
way.
I needed to talk to Daniel, but
Daniel was in Minneapolis.
and about to cause
us even more trouble.
It all began with something
as simple as a trolley.
Sorry, that's mine. - I beg
your pardon? - That's my cart.
No. Because I saw it all the
way back there and... No I
just put a dollar fifty in
the machine. - Really? - Yes.
Well then it's yours.
- Thank you.
Let me help you with that
please. - Thank you.
I always heard you British guys were
gentlemen. You are British, aren't you?
English, actually, yeah.
- English, actually.
That's where I'm going. London.
Thanks. Like your bags.
You got the whole set, huh?
Sharp.
I want you to upgrade her ticket
and put her in the seat next to me.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
- Why not?
She's on a different flight.
- A different...
But she said she was going to
London. - Oh, she is
but two hours later
and, rather crucially
in this case I think
with a different airline.
Oh, come on, you people, you have deals
with each other, you can fix something.
In this case you need to buy fresh ticket.
That's five thousand dollars.
One way.
Now, are you sure you don't
want to think about this?
You know, airports do funny things
to people. - I've made up my mind.
In that case, you want to bring the
lady over, sir, I need to see her passport.
No, you don't understand.
This has to be a coincidence, right.
She mustn't know I did this. - So
what do you want me to do, sir?
Well, make up some excuse.
About the flight being full, or
there's a special offer or maybe
this airline just picked her.
Just picked her?
Here's your seat, madam.
Champagne?
Here come the freebies.
It's just that word "complimentary".
You know, it really gets me going.
It's like, if drinks are on the house
my first thought isn't "oh,
how fabulous, how wonderful".
No, it's "how many?"
not that I'm an alcoholic.
Now, my ex-husband Jerry...
Would you excuse me one moment?
Something had gone wrong.
Daniel needed to make a decision. At the
time it was about first class or economy.
Not something you'd think would
change the rest of our lives.
But a lot can happen in three days.
And in three days
it's all fallen apart.
#MARTHA - MEET FRANK, DANIEL AND LAURENCE#
Hi!
- Hi!
This is weird, huh?
- It's...
I'm Martha, by the way.
- Daniel.
Hello.
- Daniel with the matching bags.
That's me.
Do you want to hear
something incredible?
Yeah, sure.
I'm standing in line, you know, waiting
to checkin, when this man in uniform, he
walks up to me
and he's like
Congratulations, madam, you
are the one hundred thousandth
passenger to fly on this
airline, this route, this year.
Really?
- Yes, and to mark the occasion
a completely different airline would
like to fly you first class to London."
Do you have any idea how much
those seats cost? - Remind me.
Five thousand dollars.
I mean, what kind of a jackass would
waste money like that, you know.
So, I told him to give me the cash,
you know, but he wouldn't
so I sold the ticket to a woman who couldn't
wait to give me two thousand dollars for it.
Two thousand dollars!
Plus, you know, my
seat's fine, I feel good.
I feel great.
How do you feel. - Great.
Would you like one of these?
Sir?
- I'm fine, thank you.
Oh, just can't keep away
from each other. - Yeah.
the captain just said
we've got a tailwind.
Which means we'll be in London about
half an hour early, which is great.
Is someone meeting you there?
Do you know anyone in London?
- No.
Is it your first time out
of the States? - Maybe.
So why London?
Paris was three hundred dollars.
LA was a hundred and eighty-eight.
Mexico City was three-fifty.
Seattle was one-thirty.
But London was ninety-nine.
What, you coming to London cos
it was ninety-nine dollars? - Yeah.
And it seemed like a
good place to start.
Start what?
The rest of my life.
You mean you're
never going back?
Nothing to go back for.
Except working like a mule, an
apartment I can't afford and
a man who used me to amuse his friends.
You think I'm crazy?
- No, of course I don't.
Well, actually, yes. Yes, I do.
How much money did you bring?
Do you mind me asking?
Thirty-five dollars.
- Thirty-five dollars!
They'd have put you on the first plane back.
- Yeah, right.
Even with nice British gentlemen
like yourself around, Daniel.
The ticket, Daniel.
- What ticket?
What ticket? You didn't expect
me to believe that story, did you?
The one hundred... - Please,
I'm flattered, really
No-one's ever done anything
like that for me before.
Thank you.
Plus, now I have two
thousand and thirty-five dollars.
Our conversation earlier. I
don't think you're crazy at all.
I work seventy hours a week
and I earn a fortune.
And d'you
know how big my flat is?
Three thousand square feet.
And the day after I moved
in I paid half a dozen
people who I'd never met
before to decorate it.
And one of the rooms
they called the library.
And they filled it full of books.
Thousands of books
on every subject.
And they're all second-hand.
You know why?
It was cheaper?
- No.
It's so it looks like
they've been read.
See, I have the home of a widely read
widely travelled, deeply
interesting man...
with taste.
And that's not you.
No
Not even the interesting bit?
You know what you should do?
You should just pack up and clear out.
Bring things back from your
travels, you know putting
the books up one by one
after you've read them.
Just pack up and go, huh?
To hell with the
consequences, you know.
Yeah, one day I
might just do that.
Look, I shouldn't be doing
this, okay, but
there's this hotel my company
has an arrangement with
and as a welcome to London
and a token of goodwill
I'd like you to stay there
on your first night.
No, you know I can't accept it.
- No, what, no strings.
Please
And you have to join
me for lunch tomorrow
That's the catch...
You think that's a catch? Many
people would be delighted by that.
Passport, please, sir.
- So that's the address
of the hotel, okay, and here's my card.
Daniel with the matching bags.
Cute.
Does it say that on the
card? - No.
So you ring me tomorrow, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, I won't forget.
You won't forget?
- First thing.
Thank you very much.
Passport, please, sir?
Thank You.
Hello, it's Daniel Alfrey.
Yeah, has she arrived?
- Oh, excellent.
Look I want you to
get a bouquet and send
it up to her room. Would you do that?
No, preferences. I'm
sure it'll be beautiful.
Thank you. Bye
What, does he think I'm blind? It's
right there on page two of the contract.
So tell him to sign it and get
it over here by lunchtime.
Right okay?
Bye.
Martha Dowling.
She's not a client, is she?
No, not exactly.
This hotel bill mysteriously found
its way into company expenses.
I was about to authorise it and then
realised you'd obviously made a mistake.
And were intending to
settle it yourself.
Yeah. I was.
Of course I was.
Champagne for
two at midnight?
For Two?
It was unprecedented. Daniel being
given the runaround by a woman.
You can imagine what followed. Phone
calls, phone calls, more phone calls.
Suddenly, Daniel
needed us after all.
I love my mother. I love her.
I love my mother. - Frank
come on, please!
I can't believe I've got
this audition in two hours.
Frank, he sounded desperate. - What
the hell is that? - Please, come on.
Christ, well I'm gonna break his nose,
first his nose, then his flipping jaw!
Get this: he even offered to
pay for the meal.
Fuck!
This has never happened to me before.
I can't concentrate on work, I can't eat.
Do I look pale? - I can't believe
we had to meet about this.
Frank, she was giving me the
signals, okay? A man can tell.
Yeah, right. Like champagne at
midnight with somebody else!
You're a musk magnet, Daniel.
If you'd met her, you'd understand.
I've been trying to understand
since we got here.
So, you meet some girl at an airport,
you get a big rush of blood to your head
it costs you a fortune,
and because she treats you
like a jerk, you immediately
fall in love with her.
If humiliation is what
you desire I'll arrange it,
gladly, any time, would be my
pleasure, but don't let this...
Martha.
- Martha ruin your life.
What's the big attraction anyway?
You screw her?
- Oh, I can't believe he said that.
She's obviously screwing everyone
else. - She's different, Frank.
She's different from
anybody I've ever met.
Laurence, help me out here, you
understand these things.
Describe for Frank
the perfect woman.
Please. - Now
you're just being sad.
The perfect woman.
Well she'd have a light in her eyes.
- Yes.
And an infectious, wonderful smile.
- Yes.
Talking to her you found you'd told
her things you've never told anyone.
I did, I did that. - Began to see things in
a way you've never seen them before. - Yes.
Leaving her, you knew somehow
that things had irreversibly changed
would never be the same again. - Yes!
Exactly, thank you!
So he didn't screw her? - Of
course I didn't sleep with her!
Apart from the fact that I don't sleep
with anybody on a first date, okay
we were on an
aeroplane together.
Everyone has sex on aeroplanes, Daniel.
- What are you talking about? Where?
In the cockpit, in the toilet, in the... I
did it between London and Amsterdam.
London Amsterdam's forty minutes. They
don't even let you out of your seats.
I didn't say it was great sex.
It was a rushed job, but...
And how d'you do it?
Standing up or sitting down?
What do you want, the flipping video?
What's the matter with you?
Hey, look at Florence.
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, are you all right, Flo?
You look a bit pale. - It's nothing.
What's your opinion
on all this, mate?
My opinion?
I was just thinking, the fact
that she hasn't called you doesn't
necessarily mean she's not
interested. - You don't think? - No.
Plus: we should consider
the fact that most
women that meet you do
find you very attractive.
Not all of them. - I see no reason why
this one should be any different.
She may have just lost your card.
- She may have lost my card.
and may be walking round London right
now, wishing she knew where to find you.
You see, that is friendship!
- That's the way I see it.
I hadn't even thought of the
card. Thank you, Laurence.
Thank you. I feel much better now.
Split this three ways?
Will we bollocks! It's
over a hundred quid.
So? - So I can't afford that.
You suggested this yupped-up
overpriced dump. You can flipping pay!
Frank, please. If you can't
afford it then stay at home.
Honestly, because this happens
every time, it's embarrassing.
Thank you. Keep the change.
Maybe if you didn't piss away
what little money you have
on cheap wine and space invaders or...
- No, maybe if I
didn't piss away what
little money I have on yuppie
uptight posing parlours like this dump.
- I swear to God
I'm gonna punch his lights out.
- Yeah, dream on sad boy.
Touch me with one finger, you die!
Oh, shut up, both of you! You really
want to hit each other, hit each other.
Just get it over and done with! Anything
but talking about it all the time.
It gives me a headache.
It was your fault. Let's go.
Come on, get up.
Laurence, bye-bye, mate.
Sorry. - I'll see you
when I see you.
Bye.
- Taxi.
Actually, look, I've been meaning to
speak to you about the actress.
Yeah, just don't. - Well, it's just Nicky
mentioned how upset you were, so I thought
I was not upset.
You know Laurence was concerned
enough about your condition
to drive all the way out to the
airport to speak to me about you.
Because your behaviour recently
has been a little crazy, okay?
You want my opinion?
You should go out there,
you should do this audition,
you should get a life.
And maybe then
you wouldn't be such
a pain in the arse.
Taxi.
City, please.
I love my mother deeply,
but then she smokes she
drinks, she quite openly
lives with that novelist, she...
but then she
smokes, she drinks
she quite openly lives with
that novelist
I love my mother.
I love my mother deeply.
And then she smokes, she drinks, she
quite openly lives with that novelist.
Shit!
Papa's got a head like a pingpong ball,
Papa's got a head like a ping-pong ball...
Okay, and next.
Uncle, what could be
sillier or more
hopeless than the position I
found myself in often enough?
Solid rows of celebrities
sitting in her drawing room
Good. Okay, let's go
the next one.
What is it, Frank, Frank
McEwan?
What do you mean he's gone?
Did you know, if you walk through this
park you get a unique of history England?
Oh, yeah.
It says, if you go north you see
the Houses of Parliament, right
telling us that
this is a democracy.
If you go west you see the Queen's Guards
reminding us that this is a monarchy.
If you look east you see the
flags of the Commonwealth
reminding us that this
was once an empire.
And if you look
south
you get water
reminding us that
this is an island.
Did you know that the City of London is
built on ancient Roman burial grounds?
No. Didn't know that.
- Oh, yeah.
There's over a hundred and fifty
different languages spoken in London.
And that the residential
population is eight
million, rising to ten
million in the summer time.
Ten million people.
That's a lot of people.
- Yeah.
Especially when you're
just looking for one.
One in ten million.
Sir? Can I have a
sip of your drink?
I'm out.
Thank you.
I'm Marha, by the way.
I know.
You can't know, it's
impossible. No, you can't.
You're American and you're
looking for someone that you think that
you know that you're in love
with because you feel it
right here don't you?
Actually it was here.
It was like a thunderbolt.
- A thunderbolt?
Right what does that feel like?
Just for my education. What does that
feel like, to be struck by a thunderbolt?
Happened in the airport.
I was carrying
my bags, you know
crowds everywhere, confusion, you know
and then all of a sudden
there was no more noise.
There was just him
and there was me.
And I felt sick, you know?
And it makes me so
angry.
Because that was
not the plan.
The plan was a future of irresponsible
liaisons and roads paved in gold.
The plan was not waking up
alone in a hotel room, lonely
and in love, booking
the first flight home.
What, you're going home?
Yeah there's a flight that
leaves tomorrow night.
Isn't it pathetic?
Twenty-four hours in a brand
new life and I completely choke.
And now my only hope is that when
go home no-one will have even noticed
that I'd left. You know, that way I
can get my job back and my apartment.
Oh my god!
That whisky really hit me.
Yeah, me too.
They really should
know by now.
Listen, I don't suppose you'd
consider taking a coffee...
with a certain pathetic,
spineless drunk?
They say 'like
attracts like' right?
They do, don't they.
Right, coffee or tea?
- Yeah, I'll have tea. Here.
Two teas, please, mate.
- Right you are, son.
Hello?
- Yeah, it's me!
I've got her.
- Who?
What do you mean who? Her!
Daniel's American!
what do you mean, got her?
Well eating out of my hand. You
know, pupils dilating, kind of 'got her'.
Frank, tell me, where are you now?
In the cafe in the park.
I can't wait to tell Daniel.
I am really gonna enjoy this.
Frank, listen to me.
- Look, I haven't got time for a moral
discussion Florence. I just wanted
to tell someone the good news.
It was the worst thing
that could have happened.
And with the destructive
mood Frank was in...
left alone to seduce her.
Well, you can imagine how I felt.
You know your face
is so familiar to me.
You look like somebody.
- My face is probably familiar
because as a child I was
a successful working actor.
Yeah. Then it all fell apart.
It's not such a bad life. You know, I
occasionally get "whatever happened
to" column written about me in the
newspapers. Every couple of Christmasses
they re-run some of my old films.
I get a whole new batch of love
letters from six year old girls.
Very big with six year old girls.
That's it? You don't get love
letters from anyone else?
Why?
- Why?
You know, you're funny.
You know, you have a nice smile.
Someone might be
missing out.
Where's Mr one in ten
million now then?
Forgotten all about him, ain't you?
- That's not true. - Yes it is.
You were sitting there and
you were thinking "gosh,
yes, this man is okay.
He's better than I thought".
What, you think when a
man and a woman meet each
other that's the only thing
that goes through their minds?
Of course. Yeah, when they're
attracted to one another.
In fact, most people are attracted
to just about everybody. This...
perfect partner bollocks
is just a hoax, a
physical, chemical impossibility.
Do you know why?
My perfect partner is me.
You? - Me with breasts.
Okay, that is it, I've
heard enough now.
...we like the same food, we like the
same music. The sex would be great.
What is the point
of all this?
The point is, there is
no "one in ten million".
You don't think so? - No, absolutely
not. - Then we'll agree to differ.
Right, whatever you say.
- Nice meeting you. - Yeah.
Excuse me, sir, you
haven't paid your bill.
Didn't she... right.
Oh, no, I will be back in about half
an hour. Just leave me the coffee. - No!
I'll be back for
the change later.
just think, look
on the bright side.
You see, you've still got twentyfour
hours to be as irresponsible as you like.
Look, Frank, we had a cup
of tea, all right.
I think we should just go our separate ways.
- Yeah, look. We could always swap, you see.
You stay here I go to
Minneapolis or wherever.
Have you got hot running water? If you
have, it's a damn sight more than I've got.
I appreciate the effort, really,
but, you know...
Look whatever the circumstances of your
life, they could not be
as depressing as mine!
I wouldn't bet on it!
Okay, try me.
I live in this damp,
single storey kennel.
My windows need
repairing the gas leaks
I live on the sixteenth floor
of a housing project okay.
Sleep to the sound of police
helicopters and gunfire.
Okay, parents, I don't have any.
Well, not that talk to me.
Oh, okay. My father died
when I was three and my
mother left me to become
a Seventh Day Adventist.
Okay. In the last few hours
I have blown the biggest
job opportunity I'll
probably ever have in years.
Oh, this past year alone I applied
for thirteen jobs. None called back
and my wage was cut to
a dollar eighty an hour.
In the last month I
have been arrested
and spent three nights in jail
after police found me
unconscious in the streets!
What?
You know, I mean it's...
No, you roll your eyes
and everything, you
pretend you disapprove
but the fact is you like me more than
you did an hour ago, don't you?
I love this place, it's
so full of hypocrites.
Look at that bloke pretending
he's interested in the paintings.
Look at him, look!
Oh, look, there's
one.
What does that prat care about
art? He's read in some magazine
this is the best pick-up joint in
London. That's why he's doing it.
That is such a cynical attitude.
It's realistic. People come
to art galleries for the sex.
It's true. Right, see that
couple over there?
They're here to look at the paintings.
There's nothing more boring than looking
at paintings. Only reason anyone ever
comes to an art gallery is to get laid.
I say they're interested in art.
All right, we'll
do an experiment.
No. Come on.
I'll walk that way.
You walk that way. - Okay.
By the time we meet
I guarantee you some
single man with an interest in "art",
right, will have come up to you and gone
"Oh yes, I see you
like this piece?
Perhaps we can talk
about it over a coffee?".
Okay. - Back
here, two minutes.
That way? - That's right.
- All right.
And that was it, she just disappeared.
You have two self-obsessed friends
locked into a fruitless rivalry.
They don't give a care in the world
about you or your wellbeing.
So what's the problem?
We need to go back to the airport
in London. Do we have time?
Half an hour.
When I found out Daniel had
been in Minneapolis, I decided
to meet his flight. I felt
we needed to talk about Frank.
And I knew if I didn't get him
alone. So I went to the airport.
You remember I mentioned
the plane had a tailwind?
Well, it arrived
half an hour early.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm okay.
Thank you.
Sir, where are the taxis?
- Far doors, follow the signs.
Thank you very much.
Jesus! - I'm really sorry I
did not see you standing
there. - God, what the
hell is happening to me?
Oh, no, don't worry about it. I
don't know what it is happening to me.
Are you sure? I'm just tired and I've
been travelling a long way. Are you okay?
I'm okay. - I'm sorry.
- I'm okay. Don't worry.
Don't worry, it's just not my lucky
Day.
I'm okay. - Are you sure
you're okay? - Yeah.
Sorry.
- Fine.
Next, please. - Excuse me.
Pardon me. Sorry.
Hi I'd like you to page
someone for me, please.
I don't know his name. All's I know
is I'm supposed to meet him.
Right. Well I'll need his
flight details, ma'am.
No, I'm sorry. I'm saying I'm
supposed to meet him, by that it's just
you know... You watch a lot of
sports on TV?
Yes. - You know, like gladiator
rough wrestling kind of thing?
Right, I think I need to speak to your
colleague. This is kind of a woman's thing.
You know, I'm not sure a man that watches
a lot of sports would understand what I'm
saying. - Gillian, would you like to
deal with this customer, please?
How can I help? - Hi.
Have you ever seen a man,
you know, a complete stranger.
That's the one!
It's him. - Madam...
It just hits you right here and you know it.
- Madam,
this is an airport information desk.
- I know.
We deal with lost property,
flight arrival times. - I know.
You don't understand what
this would mean to me. Please.
Madam, I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to... - Give me that microphone.
I do this in the name of sports
watching, romantically-minded men.
A much maligned,
misunderstood minority.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is airport information.
Would a gentleman wearing a...
A brown coat and
white T-shirt and
khaki pants
pair of trousers report to
the information desk now, please.
Okay, ready, come
on, back it up.
No! What's going
on?
Oi, stop, that's my
car!
Sorry, I lost
someone.
Gentleman over
there. - No.
Can you try one more time?
Just really quick, you know.
Well I could, but... - I
know, but he didn't hear.
Please, give me two
seconds.
Haven't you got any compassion?
I've only been two seconds!
Would a gentleman wearing
a white T-shirt or shirt
khaki pants and definitely
brown shoes or boots
please report to the information
desk now, please. - Never mind
Right, away you go.
What the bloody hell do you think
you're doing? - Shit, are you all right?
Hi. Look, you're in absolutely
no condition to drive
and I need the ride to London,
so why don't you get in?
You want me to. - Yes,
go around the back.
Pop in, go on.
I can't believe I'm
doing this.
Okay, here's the deal.
I'm gonna drive you into
London and I'm gonna take
you for an expensive dinner
at the Blacks Hotel.
Do you know it?
Yeah, it's a very
famous hotel.
Oh, good. So we'll eat famous
lamb with mint sauce. - Okay.
I'm Martha, by the way.
- Laurence.
You can drive, yeah? - Yeah.
Whoops, sorry. There you go, easy.
Are you all right?
No, you're not. Look at you.
You're not okay at all, are you?
Of course I wasn't allright, I've
just been knocked unconcious.
And now, an American who's
never driven a stick shift before
is driving my car on the
wrong side of the road.
I got you some ice.
No. I'm fine. - Is that better?
- I'm fine, thank you.
Nice to meet you
anyway.
It was quite an impression you made.
Oh, really? - The blood. You
know, falling into my arms.
So, what do you do for a
living? - I teach bridge.
It's a card game.
So you're a gambler?
No.
Actually, I mainly
teach old ladies.
Old ladies? So I get it. You're
like a gigolo and a gambler.
No. Not quite.
To be a teacher you must
be pretty good though, huh?
So, when was the
last time you played?
Not for a while, huh?
- No.
What's the matter? Aren't
you good enough?
Yeah, that's exactly the
problem. I'm not good enough.
I'm sorry.
No, don't worry about it.
- That was really
stupid. I'm sorry, I
shouldn't have said that.
Just,
sometimes when I get nervous, you
know, I just say the dumbest things.
When I get nervous I never say anything.
I just sit there and get uptight.
Great. She had known me just ten
minutes and already had me down
as a failed card player stuck in a
dead-end job for the rest of my life.
I could have told her
about the dreams I had.
The plans I was making
to pack up and leave.
The map on my wall covered in places
I'd go as soon as I'd saved the money
But that was something I told no
one. That was my own secret.
So this is London, huh?
- Yeah.
You lived here all
your life? - Yeah.
What's your
favourite part?
Well, it's a little corner
of my local park.
Playing chess in
the rain.
There's a tiny bandstand
surrounded by trees.
See, now that is a local's tip.
In Minneapolis all the
visitors head straight for
the the Mall of America
or the Viking's Stadium.
But the locals, there's this perfect
little spot at the top of Linden Hills.
The Linden Hills?
- The Linden Hills.
If I ever go I'll
remember.
Can I ask you a question?
If, you met a complete
stranger on an aeroplane, and he
offered you an expensive
hotel room would you take it?
Probably not.
Me neither.
Good evening, madam.
- Thank you.
Here's your bag.
- Thanks
It was nice meeting you.
- And you.
And good luck.
- You too.
Wait.
- What?
We made a deal remember?
You drive me into
London and I take you
for an expensive dinner.
I mean, I still owe
you, right? - Right.
Oh, hi!
I'd like to order some food.
Delivery.
I'd like to order a steak
medium and a lamb with that
spicy mint sauce on the side.
And some Dom Perignon.
The champagne. Yes
Thank you. Bye
I sometimes catch myself thinking
the most awful things, you know?
Yeah. I know what you mean.
So, what about you? Do you, you
know, ever think terrible things?
Yeah. Sometimes I think I should
just pack up and clear out.
Just go. - Go where?
- Don't know.
First flight anywhere.
To hell with them all.
You said "to hell with
them all". Who's them?
My friend's for example
who aren't really your
friends at all, right?
Forget your birthdays, take you for
granted, talk about themselves. - Exactly
Who else?
The person who burgled my flat three times
in the last year. - He burgled mine, too.
The people I work for.
- What about them?
They're so powdered.
And middle-aged - and
perfumed - and lecherous.
And so spectacularly
flipping untalented!
All I want to do is take a mirror
and hold it up to their grotesque
sagging surgically
adjusted faces and say
"Forget it! Get back to your wife."
- Exactly...
Jesus. - Oh my god.
What is that? London Bridge?
- Albert bridge.
Hold on.
At your service.
- Very good thinking. - Yeah.
Thank you.
- Cheers.
You know, all of my life I
was told if I worked hard.
stayed out of trouble my
life'd be a fairy tale.
In 1988 my high school gave
me this plaque. You know,
"most likely to be successful".
You know where it hangs?
It's hanging by my desk
in a rental car company.
Where you work for
sixty hours a week.
Yeah for a neanderthal boss who
sticks his ass on the copying machine.
So, what, it all became clear in here?
Exactly.
Except it was here.
It was like my eyes just completely
opened up, kind of like
like St Paul on the road to De...
wherever. - Damascus. - Yes, exactly.
Then one night I realised if I
wanted to I could just take off.
Who'd miss me?
- No-one.
So the next morning I picked up my cheque
which was a couple of hundred dollars
packed my bags, and the first
flight I could afford was London.
So, voila, here I am!
First flight
anywhere?
Just take someone with you.
Trust me, it's less scary that way.
But finding the right person, you'd need
someone with all the right similarities
yet all the
right differences.
Someone to read your mind
instinctively. Thanks.
Yet cover your
weaknesses.
Can I ask you a
question?
Do you believe that
things happen for a reson?
I don't understand.
Well, I'm starting to
believe that nothing
happens without a reason.
You know, these random
things that happen aren't
random at all.
I think things happen because
well, they're
meant to happen.
Like I think I was meant to
come to London, you know?
Just, something pulling me here.
Because some way or
somehow there were
better things in store for me.
Like what?
Like...
Room service.
What was that?
The food. - The food? - We ordered
food, remember? Mint sauce.
I'll go to the, the bathroom
and you can get the door.
Oh my god!
Room service.
Yes!
For the lady.
- Thank you.
With the compliments of
Mr Alfrey. - Thank you.
Wait. What was that name again?
Alfrey, sir. Daniel Alfrey.
There's a card in the flowers.
Oh, and dinner will be right with you.
If they think there's gonna
be anything left of this
place when get through they
got another thing coming.
Laurence?
No!
Laurence!
It was typical
It was the most perfect night of
your life. - And I froze.
Put Daniel first when I should have thrown
away his flowers and taken her in my arms.
Yeah, but don't you see, that's
what makes you so special You...
you were loyal to a friend. You
put principles first.
You took the moral
high ground.
Then how do you
explain this? - What?
Right now she's
asleep in my bed.
In your bed?
Well, unless I'm very
much mistaken, I
think I missed something.
You remember the following day
Daniel invited us to lunch? - Yeah.
Well it all happened then.
- Laurence, help
me out here, you
understand these things.
Describe to Frank the perfect woman.
You are sad.
- Please.
The perfect woman.
Well, she'd have
a light in her eyes.
An infectious, wonderful smile.
Yes.
- Talking to her you found you told
her things you've never told anyone.
I did, I did that.
Began to see things in a way
you've never seen them before. - Yes.
Leaving her, you knew somehow
things had irreversibly changed. - Yes.
would never be the same again.
- Exactly! Thank you!
So he didn't screw her?
- Of course I didn't sleep with her!
Oh, shut up both of you!
You really want to hit each
other, hit each other. Just get it
over and done with! Anything but
talking about it all the time.
It gives me a headache.
He was angry.
I was.
- Furious.
You saw Daniel was involved and loyalty
to friends always comes first, remember?
What happened next?
...and adding them to the number
of your two longest suits.
Sorry.
Hello?
Yeah, it's me I've got her.
Who? - What do you mean,
who? Her! Daniel's American!
What do you mean, got her?
- Eating out of my hand. You know
pupils dilating, kind of "got her".
Listen, where are you now?
- In the cafe in the park.
I can't wait to tell Daniel.
I am really gonna enjoy this.
Frank, listen to me.
- Look, I haven't got time for a moral
discussion, Florence. I just wanted
to tell someone the good news.
Ladies, I can't explain, there's
something I
have to do.
Something very important.
And if I don't do it now
I may never
forgive myself.
Looking for a man in a dark coat.
Oh, there's another one, look.
What does he care about art?
...this is the best pick-up joint in
London. That's why he's doing it.
All right. We'll do an
experiment. Come on.
I'll go that way.
You go that way.
Oh my God. - Oh my god!
What are you doing here?
I was just...
Do you have any idea
how weird this is?
Us meeting like this?
Aren't you pleased
to see me?
No. Yes. Yes I am.
- Yes you are.
No you're not. What's
wrong? - Nothing.
I was just leaving.
- Me too.
Would you help me
with my bags?
You know, I could take
this silence personally
but after what you told me
yesterday, I'll assume that
you're just nervous and I'll
take that as a compliment.
And whatever it is you're
so angry about just stop
it.I realise I owe you
an apology. I should have
never accepted that
hotel, it was irresponsible
the business with the
flowers and everything.
What happened to
your hand?
I made an omelette this
morning.
You know that they say that
clumsiness is linked to your emotions.
Oh, is that right?
You'll allow me to take that
as a second compliment.
In the absence of any
conversation that is.
This is great.
At my apartment I'd have to
walk up sixteen storeys.
The elevator works okay but it's strictly
for drug deals and contract fellatio.
Oh, it's all right.
I'll get the door.
If you want to make
yourself comfy
I'll make us
some tea.
- Yum.
I'll be right
back. - Okay.
Hello?
- It's me. - Daniel.
this isn't a good time.
You're right. It's
a terrible time.
I'm thirty-three
years old
and I feel like
a jilted teenager.
I've bunkered up on a diet of chocolate
and afternoon television and books.
Books that I don't
even understand.
Daniel this really isn't
Laurence, I hurt in places
I didn't know existed.
Daniel, I said this isn't a
good time!
Laurence?
These for your card
playing? - Yeah.
Thought you said
you had no talent? - I don't
Then why does it have your name on
it? - Oh, my partner did all the work.
Your partner?
He really could
read people.
Oh, come on, you
can do that. - I'm sorry?
Well, if someone's telling
the truth, or if they're lying
you know, you can learn
how to read the signs.
Like right now you're still
upset about something.
Oh, really?
Are these yours?
They're good.
I just paid you a compliment.
You could smile a little.
Thank you.
Whatever it is that's so important
just say it, okay. I mean,
you've been like this ever
since we ran into one another.
No I haven't. - Then why are
you looking at me like that?
Because I... You...
Because what?
Because...
Will you excuse me?
- Sure.
Yes? - I give up, you
know.
I no longer
understand women.
Frank, this isn't a
good time.
Yeah. It's a bloody
terrible time.
Well, we were at the gallery, you know,
she was eating out of my hand.
All of a sudden she
just like that, she just
disappears on the way back to Daniel.
To Daniel?
- Yeah.
she had her heart set on
him all along, didn't she?
And I mean, I gave
her my best shot, but
credit to him, he's got her
well and truly.
Daniel. - Well, she told me
herself you know.
She met him at the
airport, didn't she?
The moment she saw
him she knew.
Something about his little
brown jacket and khaki trousers
I didn't know he
wore khaki trousers.
Florence?
Laurence? Oh don't get...
Everything okay?
Everything's fine. You just relax.
Mummy, mummy!
Mummy, Martha!
Laurence!
Good morning.
- Morning
Tea time
Are you gonna ask questions
or do I just talk?
I want to talk about love,
friendship and deceit.
I want to talk about the fact that up until
three days ago there were three friends...
Do you know anyone in London?
I'm Martha, by the way.
- I know.
Would you take it?
- Probably not.
When I found out Daniel had been in
Minneapolis I decided to meet his flight.
It was a disaster that night,
I didn't sleep at all.
Surprise, surprise.
- No, I think it was hot.
Hot? You was angry.
I was.
Which brings us up
to date.
You have a decision
to make.
Yes. - Lifelong
friends on one side
a woman on the other. Perhaps the
closest friends you'll ever have.
Buddies through thick and
thin. What's the problem?
Bearing in mind there's no such
thing as a difficult decision.
Sorry? - Well, every day
we make
hundreds of thousands
of decisions.
In a year they run
into tens of millions.
People get themselves into
knots.
The truth is decisions are
easy. You know why?
Because every time we
already know the answers.
You think? - Absolutely. Trade
secret. I always tell my boys.
You see, you didn't come to
see me to make a decision.
You came to me because you didn't
like the decision you'd already made.
Sorry, Laurence, time's up.
Thank you very much.
- I feel so good - So do I.
Well, I'm, I'm always here.
- Brilliant. I'm sorry for waking you.
You know, it's funny: there's a
psychiatrist living next door to me
and you chose
to talk to me.
And I'm flattered.
It's been a pleasure
meeting you, Laurence.
you're not...
What line of work are
you in? Just out of interest.
Construction.
- Construction?
You take care.
- Thank you.
Martha?
Breakfast. Flower
market cafe in square.
Excuse me.
- Oh my God.
Funny!
Florence! - Oh, what the hell
is going on? Would you please...
We've been set up! - Go away, both
of you. What are you doing here?
...both piss of. Frank, what are you
on? I'd really like some. It's obviously
completely hilarious. Please go now.
This is pretty funny?
Hilarious.
Listen, before I take off, I just need to
know, does this happen all the time?
No. - No, these male clubs where
where guys pick up a girl and
they set her up and they make her
fall in love, and then they rip the
rug out from underneath their feet.
Does this happen all the time? Or
have I just been really unlucky?
Oh, no, I can explain.
Frank, shut up!
What could you possibly
explain to me?
See, I'm a little bit older than six,
and the only people interested in you
are six year old girls. Sorry.
Martha, listen to me. - Daniel.
Please, you're a sweet little man.
But a hundred bucks says that
you took down those books and
you put 'em right back up without
reading a single one of 'em.
Am I right?
- My books? - Yeah.
Actually I did
do that, yes.
See, maybe it's me, I mean,
I thought that this would be
different, you know?
But if you think that this is gonna
get me down, you're wrong.
Because I'm tough. You know?
I've made a
decision.
I've changed my life, something none of
you have the courage to do, none of you.
Just gonna stand there? Do you
have anything to say to me?
Yeah, well, I think I can explain,
if you just give me the time.
No, ignore him. - Please.
I don't know who he is.
Don't freeze on me.
Don't freeze on
now, please.
Please don't.
Frank, shut up! - Don't
tell me to shut up!
You are so arrogant! - What the
hell are you so uptight about?
Wait! Martha!
Laurence, I'm sorry,
mate. I wasn't with it.
Don't push me!
You see?
- Don't push me?
Like it? See, it hurts yeah.
Stop! My eye!
- Sorry.
Hey, like that, do
you?
Sir? - The first flight anywhere
for ninety-nine pounds.
I beg your pardon?
- You heard what I said.
You have a date in
mind for your return?
No return. I beg your pardon?
- I'm not coming back.
One way. Thank
you.
Because there comes a point
when you find the one person
the one thing
that ever mattered.
Damn it! Instead
of holding it tight
and recognising it
for the priceless, most
beautiful, precious
gift it is.
Instead of having
the courage
you do what you've done all your
life. All your life! You freeze.
Freeze!
So the truth is whatever
name you pull out of that hat
things'll be a whole lot
better there than they are here.
Reykjavik.
- I'm sorry?
Capital of Iceland,
sir.
Some attractive features, I'm
told. Four hundred miles of iceberg,
long haired sheep, and twenty
hours of darkness a day.
Your flight leaves at
twenty-two hundred hours.
Reykjavik? - First flight,
anywhere. Ninety-nine pounds.
Thank you.
Have you made a
decision yet madam?
Deny to me,
Deny that it felt good.
It felt good.
- It felt bloody magnificent.
I feel like I've become a member of
some historic male club, you know?
This is how women feel
when they give birth.
Yeah, except for
the hands probably.
Yeah, why don't they tell you it hurts
your hands like that? I never knew that.
Come on. I still can't work
out what he was doing there.
Who? Laurence?
- Yeah.
Standing there with
those flowers.
What were they? Peonies? He
probably got them for his flat.
Yeah, he's probably got them
to stick in his bridge trophies.
Can you imagine if he
was there to meet her?
Excuse me, excuse
me a, a moment, sir.
You are the one hundred thousandth
passenger to fly on
this airline this year.
Right. - And to mark
the occasion
the airline would like
to fly you first class.
First class?
Here we go, sir, first class.
Here's your seat, down here.
Are you sure this is...
- Yes.
Iceland, huh?
London and Amsterdam
that's like not even...
Forty minutes, I know.
He didn't recommend it.
Well, we have all the
time in the world.
#THE END#
