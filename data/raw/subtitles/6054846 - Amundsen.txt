I can't feel my feet!
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
We're almost there.
In England they believe
Amundsen is dead
Just leave whatever
you've stolen
and get the hell
out of here.
- Go. Leave!
- Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm sorry, I'm...
Roald's brother.
Oh, yeah?
I'm Leon.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I thought no one was home.
I didn't realize.
Bess Magids.
I arrived just yesterday.
He... didn't tell you?
No.
I...
I'm sorry I intruded,
and I'll let you
get back to sleep.
No, it's fine. I...
I can't sleep.
I guess I'm still
on Canada time.
Oh.
How do you know
my brother?
Oh, well, we've known each other
for a couple years now.
Oh.
There isn't...
a-any news,
by any chance?
No.
I know I saw a bottle
of wine around here somewhere.
Ah.
- Personally, I prefer whiskey, but...
- Oh.
this is better than nothing.
He was supposed to fly
across the pole
and be back in good time
to meet me here.
Instead, there's Wisting,
waiting as I stepped off.
- Good man, Wisting.
- Mm.
He seemed a little bit
more worried than either of us.
Yeah.
It is weird,
looking at you.
Why?
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't think you two
looked alike at first,
but now I...
So he hasn't spoken about me?
Oh, well...
He mentioned he had
many brothers, of course.
But he hasn't really
talked about me.
No, but...
We don't talk
about family and such.
But he talked about
the expeditions, right?
The Northwest Passage
and the South Pole?
Of course.
But nothing about me?
No, but you weren't
on any of those.
No, no, no.
Roald and I,
we're not really talking.
We haven't spoken
for a few years now.
Really? What happened?
Uh...
I'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that.
No, that's fine.
We were four brothers,
but mostly it was just
Roald and I.
And our father,
did Roald talk to you about him?
He owned ships or something,
and was an adventurer?
I don't know about adventurer,
but he always came home
with the best gifts, you know?
I remember when he came home
with that globe.
What's that in the middle?
So the air can reach the flame.
No, what's there?
For real.
No one knows. No one has
ever been that far north.
Some believe
there is land up there.
Yet to be discovered.
Roald kept staring
at the holes at the poles.
Everything else was already
mapped out by then.
but, you know, those holes,
those areas,
were all that was left
to discover, really.
Roald became obsessed
with the poles.
Look!
Four degrees!
He started experimenting
with polar conditions.
Good night.
And you.
- Just a little more?
- No, you can read more tomorrow.
Good night, Roald.
Our father died at sea,
thousands of miles from home.
Then a few years later
our mother fell ill.
Leon, take care of your brother.
You're the big brother.
Take care of Roald.
When Fridtjof Nansen
returned in triumph
after being the first man
to cross Greenland on skis,
it was impossible
to hold us back.
From that day,
Roald and I knew exactly
what we were going to be.
Our first test was this
excursion to Hardangervidda.
We got caught in a blizzard.
I kept walking in circles
all night to keep safe.
In the morning I realized
that Roald was gone.
Roald!
Instead of walking in circles,
he had taken shelter
in a snow cave.
But the temperature dropped
during the night,
so he woke up
in this coffin of ice.
Roald!
Roald!
Roald!
Hang in there!
His reaction made me realize
that he had something
that I didn't have.
I didn't really know
what it was.
I just knew for sure
that I didn't have it.
You saved his life.
I can't help it.
I keep looking at the door,
thinking he's going
to suddenly burst in.
Keep talking, please.
It's good to hear you talk.
- The Northwest Passage?
- Yes.
Roald was the second officer
on the first ship
to spend the winter
in the Antarctic, you know.
After that, he came up
with this crazy plan
to use a small fishing vessel
to do what the huge British
expeditions had failed to.
You weren't on it?
No, no, no.
I stayed home and took care
of the funding.
Roald went to confront the ice.
And you, the creditors.
The first man to sail
through the last path
of the Northwest Passage.
The up-and-coming
young Norwegian explorer,
Roald Amundsen.
{\an8}THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY,
LONDON
Thank you. It's...
Thank you. Um...
It's...
It's such an honor
to be here.
Thank you.
Oh.
I would also like to thank you,
Dr. Nansen.
I would not be standing here
today if it wasn't for your...
your advice, your support.
Thank you.
In our quest
for the Northwest Passage,
we spent two winters
in a small,
completely isolated harbor
called Uqsuqtuuq.
We named the place
Gjoa Haven.
A bit easier to pronounce.
And here we got the chance
to meet and study
the Netsilik Inuits.
They taught us
invaluable lessons
on how to survive
in Arctic conditions.
They travel efficiently
over the ice
using lightweight sledges,
very light,
and polar dogs.
And this method proved
absolutely vital to us
in our exploration
of the land.
The Netsilik way of life is,
of course, unique
and highly specialized,
and they are now among the last
indigenous people who have yet
to encounter missionaries
from the south.
So...
- Well, not for long, eh?
- Hear, hear.
It's...
I hear people say lots of things
about the Inuit.
That they are lazy,
for example.
Well, they are not lazy.
They are smart.
They know that if you hurry
too much, you sweat too much.
And if you sweat too much
in freezing temperatures,
that could mean
the end of your life.
You see, Roald had
learned basic survival skills
from the Inuits.
This was key to fulfill
our dream,
becoming the first
to reach the North Pole.
But the British didn't seem
to take these lessons
in so-called "primitive
survival skills" seriously,
even though they were planning
an expedition of their own.
That was a well-presented
lecture, Amundsen.
The English are skeptical to polar dogs.
They prefer setters.
Mr. Scott.
Ah.
My friend, how are you?
Good to see you.
You have met, I presume?
- No.
- Ah.
Roald Amundsen, this...
This is Robert Falcon Scott.
Pleasure to meet you.
And congratulations.
I'm deeply impressed.
Well, the pleasure
is all mine.
You know, the stories
of British explorers
changed my life.
John Franklin, I mean.
We would never have made it
without the British pioneers.
But someone had to take
the last step.
And with such
a tiny fishing vessel.
- Who'd have thought it?
- No, no.
She was tired
at the end, but...
And you?
Ambassador Nansen?
I assume that you're ready
to explore again.
You heading for the pole?
Which is it to be?
- North or South?
- Mm...
I'm still tied up in diplomacy,
I'm afraid.
Of course. After all...
there are more important things
than examining ice.
Gentlemen.
A pleasure.
Do you think he's going north or south?
Remember this, Amundsen:
Studying the Arctic
is not about being first,
but about exploring the waters' area,
depth and character.
They're all planning expeditions.
We don't have much time.
To cover 3000 km in 100 days,
we need minimum weight
and maximum speed.
The English have motor sleds.
Scott tested them up in Finse.
I'd prefer polar bears
to pull our sleds.
But I probably won't go
for that in this situation.
Only one thing is proven
for something like this:
Polar dogs.
Many polar dogs.
Suddenly, Nansen's wife
became seriously ill.
And we saw that as an opening
to borrow his ship, Fram.
We don't want visitors.
I understand. I apologize.
My name is Roald Amundsen.
Your father knows who I am.
If you could tell him it's me,
perhaps that will change matters?
I'll let you have Fram.
On two conditions.
One:
Hjalmar Johansen...
constantly comes begging for money.
But I am the one
who's indebted to him.
He deserves a second chance.
I thought Johansen
wasn't in any condition to...
- Doesn't he drink?
- Hjalmar is going with you.
And the second?
I don't want Fram used for some
headless race to the North Pole.
This is a research mission.
Research.
Understood?
Black six-man tents,
20 pairs of hickory skis,
five cooking pots, two sextants,
one spirit compass, two field glasses,
two cameras and three hypsometers.
One challenge related to speed
is that at temperatures
below minus 25,
the snow changes consistency.
We can solve that with a thin
layer of ice under the runners.
But the weight is key.
Each sled must be under one ton.
We have the dogs.
- Meaning?
- As the weight decreases,
we won't need as many sled dogs.
Polar dogs are cannibals, so they
will provide well for us and them.
That's nature. It's no worse
with a dog than a pig.
You see a difference
between a dog and a pig?
I think most people do.
I'm not happy about
eating loyal travel companions.
The question is: Do we want to be first,
or is that not so important?
Wisting!
So then we started
gathering the crew.
210.
You'll probably be
the first one to discover
new land up there in the ice.
Thank you, but I want you
to have that honor, Captain.
...all the information.
What is it?
Captain.
I came as quick as I could.
Is something wrong?
Roald?
What does it say?
"North Pole Reached."
- Frederick Cook?
- Cook?
"Cook left his diaries with
a local hunter." He has no evidence.
The expedition is dead.
- Even if he didn't actually make it?
- And he has no evidence?
Roald is right.
As long as they claim it,
it's no longer newsworthy.
No one will finance our expedition.
It's over.
We'll continue as planned.
But go to the South Pole.
Let's just do it.
OK.
But how?
Let's keep it secret,
tell no one, and go all in.
Mum's the word.
Yes.
That means we have to lie to everyone.
Nansen, of course, but...
Also the King.
But that...
We won't worry about that.
Let's instead think about
what happens...
if we succeed.
Imagine if we succeed.
Imagine if we succeed!
Hi, Hjalmar.
What?
Are you planning on
bringing that cabin up north?
You know it will get crushed in the ice.
Churned into the sea.
Are you that confident
you'll find land up there?
- Did you row all the way from town?
- Yes.
Have to use my strength for something.
True.
I...
I'm a different man
up there in the ice.
Just ask Nansen.
When he hurt his back,
I had to carry him.
Did you know that?
I suppose that's how it is.
We're all better men up there.
Why not join us?
Perhaps you're too old.
- I'm two years older than you!
- Is that all?
No, I need to stay here.
We're still not financed 100%.
I spoke to a radio producer.
I can't bring a radio.
Then Nansen will contact me.
Tell me to turn back.
When are we going to tell him?
When it's too late.
{\an8}MADEIRA, SEPTEMBER 9, 1910
{\an8}Many people have had many questions
about this expedition.
Why we are bringing a cabin
up to the Arctic drift ice.
Why we brought 90 polar dogs
from Kristiansand,
instead of picking them up in Alaska
on our way back north.
And the truth of the matter is...
that...
We have no intention
of heading north again
after rounding Cape Horn.
We are going to continue southward.
The British plan to annex Antarctica.
Robert Scott is on his way
with 65 men,
motorized sleds and horses.
It appears the only thing
he forgot to consider...
is us.
Because we...
are going to be the first...
to reach the South Pole.
So all I really need to
know is that I have
your full...
support.
And that those who want
to take part in this
raise their hand.
Very good.
Then that's settled.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
At this moment King Haakon is
being informed of our change of plans.
I ask you not to judge me too harshly.
I assure you that I one day
shall resume the original plan
and study the ocean currents
around the North Pole.
This is no longer an expedition.
It's a race.
This is Antarctica.
The coldest place on Earth.
A desert of ice.
First we raise our cabin, Framheim,
at the Bay of Whales.
We will spend the winter there,
after placing depots along the route.
Once the sun returns
after the polar night,
we shall begin
our 1300-kilometer-long journey
to the South Pole.
There is no map.
And little information
about what to expect.
Only the knowledge
that no human
has set foot here before.
{\an8}FIRST ATTEMPT, SEPTEMBER 8, 1911
It's minus 56 degrees!
We have to turn back!
We're all spread out!
Turn back.
Every man for himself!
Let the others know!
Are you all right?
Yes, we're coming!
I see you...
You took your sweet time?
We headed out too soon.
You left us behind.
You abandoned...
I made it clear that it was
every man for himself on the way back.
You don't abandon your men
to die!
In a blizzard!
Nansen would never have done that.
This wasn't an expedition.
This was panic.
You set out too early,
to get a head start on Scott.
The thing is...
Scott.
Scott has been preparing for four years.
He's taking Shackleton's old route
over the mountain.
While we go this way.
Through a terrain
where no one has ever set foot.
We may as well be
on a foreign planet, Johansen.
And you think...
that should be without risk?
Have I not made myself clear?
Are there...
certain individuals here
who still don't understand
what kind of undertaking this is?
- No.
- No.
Because in that case...
it might be useful, Johansen,
if you shared with us,
since you care so much for him,
what Nansen's motto was
when he crossed Greenland.
What was it,
Johansen?
"Death..."
"...or the west coast of Greenland."
Yes.
So what do you think ours is?
Johansen.
I have...
You won't be joining us any further.
I want you to map the area
around King Edward's Land.
Under Presterud's command.
Why are you telling me this?
Maybe so you know
a little bit more
about the man you're getting
involved with.
Have you ever been out
in Arctic conditions?
No.
Ever driven a dogsled
in a blizzard?
Why?
I have.
{\an8}SECOND ATTEMPT, OCTOBER 20, 1911
{\an8}DAY 10
Are you ready?
{\an8}DAY 24
Wisting!
Come on!
Mount.. Bjaaland.
Mount Hassel.
Mount Hanssen.
Mount Wisting.
Mount Presterud.
And Mount Johansen.
We might as well
get started.
Want me to do it?
It looks good to me.
No thanks.
I'm not that hungry.
Ever seen a man with scurvy, Bjaaland?
First you start acting strange.
Listless and tired.
Then...
your gums start bleeding.
Your teeth fall out.
Then old sores and fractures
flare up again.
What about you, Wisting?
What are you thinking about?
Just that...
Here we are.
In the world's largest wilderness.
The same size
as all of North America.
And that flame...
is the only source of heat
on the entire continent.
With the exception of Scott's,
of course.
{\an8}DAY 40
{\an8}DAY 45
{\an8}DAY 55
How far do we have left?
I think we're very close.
Very, very close.
I don't know if those match mine.
What do you have?
Hang on.
I'm double-checking now.
As far as I can tell, it's correct.
OK.
So then...
Then that's settled.
Come on, let's do this.
Let's do this.
{\an8}THE SOUTH POLE, DECEMBER 14, 1911
Look at the flag.
So which way is north?
- That way, right?
- No, that way.
I'm thinking it's that way.
Strange how it's all connected.
And surely no one has ever
been in a place
more diametrically opposed
to their stated goal.
That's also amusing.
Let him go.
I wonder where the Englishmen are.
Dear Captain Scott.
As you are probably the first
to reach this spot after us,
I will ask you kindly
to forward the enclosed letter
to King Haakon VII.
If you have any use for
the articles left in this tent,
please do not hesitate
to help yourself.
The sled outside
may also be of use to you.
With kind regards,
I wish you a safe return.
Telegram for Amundsen.
A telegram?
- What does it say?
- "Agrbf amgif akr..."
It's in code!
What does it say?
We made it!
Know what, Nicolay?
I never really liked this china.
We can't have bad china.
Now we can buy a new set!
Amundsen reached the South Pole!
Amundsen reached the South Pole!
Amundsen reached the South Pole!
{\an8}THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY,
LONDON
Well, gentlemen,
we don't usually allow ladies
into the club.
But since little Mary here has
written such a beautiful poem,
I thought we may
make an exception.
Though naught but a simple cross
Now marks those heroes' grave
Their names will live forever
O England, land of the brave
Captain Scott and his brave men
reached the South Pole
on the 17th of January,
only to discover
that Mr. Amundsen
had got there first.
One can imagine
the sense of deception
that our brave countrymen
must have felt
on their way back
from the pole.
And thanks to Scott's diaries,
we know exactly
what happened.
We know that Mr. Amundsen
wrote a letter
to the King of Norway,
which he wanted Captain Scott
to deliver on his behalf...
mistaking our officers
for mailmen.
Our guest was attended
by good fortune throughout.
Fine weather.
Sound health.
A transport that never
broke down.
For which we congratulate him.
Captain Scott,
a true British hero...
who pulled his own sled...
may have lost
an unequal battle
against illness and hunger.
But he refused to resort
to barbarism,
behaving like a gentleman
until the bitter end.
I should therefore
like to propose a toast.
To the true heroes
of this expedition...
the dogs.
Oh, I see you're planning
for the moon, Mr. Amundsen.
Charles Bennett.
Good to see you,
my friend.
- Good to see you.
- You must meet my wife,
a fellow citizen of yours.
Kristine Elisabeth.
Mrs. Bennett.
It's an honor.
You can just call me Kiss.
And the honor is all mine,
Mr. Amundsen.
Forgive me.
The treatment you are
getting from these British is shameful.
After such a triumph!
It was...
terrible to learn
about Mr. Scott and his men.
Frightful bad luck.
I...
So close to safety.
Well, when you prepare
everything,
you have everything in order,
they call it luck.
And when you neglect to take
even the most necessary
precautions
and meet defeat,
they call it bad luck.
What do you mean?
Well, Scott.
He was a great scientist.
Excellent sportsman.
But Nansen had told him
to use skis, dogs.
But he still...
He insisted on...
On machines and ponies.
When the British tend to want
to conquer things...
They do, they do,
but you can't conquer nature.
You just...
You just can't.
You just have
to play along... with it.
He has a thing
for married women,
I guess.
- Are you?
- Married?
- Mm-hm.
- Yes.
I know about Kiss.
There have been others.
So what?
We're both adults.
Do you think Roald
would forgive us
if we took a taste
of one of the bottles
from the South Pole?
Do you know who owns
this house?
The one person
who has no need for it.
{\an8}THE OLD GENTLEMEN'S CLUB,
KRISTIANIA, JULY, 1916
- Congratulations, Amundsen!
- Look this way, please!
Kiss.
Kiss.
Can you hear me?
Honorable Roald Amundsen.
We Norwegians
are proud
that you planted the Norwegian flag
on the South Pole
before the English!
It's impossible to imagine
what sacrifices
this incredible feat demanded.
What steadfastness and heroism.
With such a triumph
it's easy to forget
that the South Pole wasn't
the real goal. Merely a step on the way.
But Amundsen is a man of his word.
So next year he is heading through
the Bering Strait, into the ice.
And cold.
And darkness.
To study the polar currents
and drift across the North Pole.
For at least five years!
This may sound like
a superhuman challenge.
But Amundsen
is also the right man for that.
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Nansen has this theory
that I can drift in the ice
all the way to the pole.
And what happens
on the North and South Pole
is crucial for the global climate.
But this isn't what you want.
This was his condition
for lending me Fram.
I didn't think he would hold me to it.
No.
Five years in the ice...
We don't have to worry about that.
It means nothing for us.
When we think about each other,
it's as if we are together.
I feel you.
I feel you.
I feel you.
Right?
We have our wireless conversation
that no one can take from us.
You...
You are mine.
You are mine, mine, mine.
You will always feel
that I am with you.
Always.
Roald was forced
to prove Nansen's theory
that it was possible
to drift with the polar ice
all the way
to the North Pole.
So he...
ordered this new ship,
tailor-made for himself,
named Maud.
And that ship...
costs much more than we had.
Only a sensational triumph
could save us
from total bankruptcy.
But as it turned out,
it would take a long time
to drift towards the pole.
A very long time.
{\an8}FIRST YEAR IN THE ICE
CAPE CHELYUSKIN, SIBERIA
{\an8}Five months left
{\an8}till the next sunrise.
We have to chop ice
before the ship gets crushed.
- How does this look, Captain?
- We need to remove more.
Right here...
Captain!
Captain!
Wisting, come here!
UNKNOWN AREA
Hmm.
Yes...
Bear!
Bear!
Bear!
- Want some of this?
- No, just get it over with.
I'll take some.
You'll be fine.
{\an8}SECOND YEAR IN THE ICE
{\an8}AYON ISLAND, EAST SIBERIAN SEA
2250 KM FROM NORTH POLE
Captain?
Nice mustache.
I'm in the process...
Tessem...
wishes to leave the expedition.
He can't get rid of his headache.
And can hardly sleep.
How far is it to that telegraph station
on Dickson Island?
Around 700 kilometers.
Impossible.
Knudsen has volunteered to go with him.
Tessem?
We need to send some mail
to the people back home.
Could you take responsibility for that?
Yes, Captain.
Bring Knudsen.
We'll give you a dog team.
You should make it in four weeks.
You know,
it does something to a man,
being trapped in the ice
for so long.
What do you mean?
Welcome, one and all.
Will you look at this!
I haven't heard from you
for some time.
I walk around here
making small talk with you.
It's time you respond.
I have transferred my property,
Villa Uranienborg,
to you.
So I know you will always have a home.
No matter what might happen.
{\an8}THIRD YEAR IN THE ICE
{\an8}CAPE SERDZE-KAMEN, CHUKCHI SEA
2570 KM FROM NORTH POLE
- What's going on?
- Shh!
Please.
Sverdrup, get the medical kit.
Cod-liver oil is never wrong.
Did that taste good?
This is so delicious.
I think we have to taste it
right away.
Do you want some on there?
- Mm-hm.
- Very well.
No, no!
No, no, no!
Look at this.
More playmates, I see.
That is one special...
One very special person.
What?
Her father wants us
to bring her to Norway.
Get an education.
But that...
We can't bring all of them.
Kakonita is an orphan.
That's different.
But we can't start...
That...
I think it's time for that film
from the South Pole.
Those are penguins.
They can't fly. They just walk around.
Let's see if it wants the pipe.
No, it doesn't.
Imagine when Kiss meets them.
We'll be like a small family.
We will.
[Roald Of course Nansen is right
about his ocean-current theories.
But five years in the ice
is much too optimistic.
The expedition
went on for too long,
and Roald lost his focus.
He began to think
of other means and technology
to reach the North Pole.
We must.
We must.
If there is land up here,
with people, with a civilization...
We must reach the North Pole.
See it with our own eyes.
Girls?
And then he just left,
making Wisting the captain.
Hyah!
We put all our money
in that boat.
Everything.
{\an8}ALASKA, USA, 1923
{\an8}We know nothing
{\an8}about this vast white space.
{\an8}These two-and-a-half million
square kilometers
of frozen polar sea.
So we...
are going to fly there.
We will be the first
to look down
at the last piece
of the Earth
that has resisted every attempt
of discovery.
And we have no guarantees,
of course,
that we will find land
up there.
A hidden continent
beyond the pole.
But if we do,
it will be one of the most
significant discoveries
in the history
of the world.
But then he got hold
of two Junker airplanes
and named them
Kristine and Elisabeth,
and I guess you know
how that went.
Thirty meters of flight,
and then...
$80,000 worth of planes just...
left there in the snow.
He...
He lost it.
I'm sorry, but there's
no other way of putting it. He...
You don't know him.
I'm sorry?
I mean, you did once,
but you...
you don't.
I think I know my brother
better than anyone.
I was there.
That's where we met.
In Alaska.
In Deering.
He did not strike me
an irrational man.
Just the opposite.
Well, you haven't heard
the whole story yet.
Amundsen Gives Up Polar Flight
Aline?
Hello.
My name is Engelbregt Gravning.
We just wanted to drop by
to let you know
we're moving in next door.
So that was...
Oh...
Look, there are some other children!
Hi there!
My, you sure have grown.
Meet these two lovely girls.
I'm going to enroll them in school.
These girls are smart.
Wow!
All the way from America.
Say goodbye to Uncle Leon.
Bye-bye!
- Bye.
- Thanks for a lovely day.
Bye!
I was worried
about what he was up to.
But Roald continued
his hopeless romance with Kiss,
who lived in London
with her husband.
And he kept spending money
we didn't have.
Roald?
Look at this.
They are so smart!
Wait till they start school.
May I have a word?
- Now?
- Yes.
Polar Paradise
"Has Roald Amundsen lost his mind?"
It's much easier with dogs.
They don't read the newspapers.
You had to beat them, didn't you?
Out there?
You mean we should do the same
with journalists?
Polar dogs are like wild animals.
It was brutal,
but the only way to get them to obey.
I know you have ordered
three new airplanes.
I was going to tell you...
It's impossible.
Cancel the order.
Do you really want to fly again?
Considering how it went?
- That was bad luck. The landing gear...
- Luck?
What were you thinking, with those
small planes? That isn't science!
That's... sport.
Highly dangerous.
It was OK when we made money.
- We had no choice with the South Pole.
- Or now. I'm getting old, Leon.
I don't have time to do things
Nansen's way. Not even Nansen does.
Someone will fly to the North Pole.
It's simply a matter
of who gets there first.
Those planes were too small.
We need something bigger,
and we can get it.
Come!
I have...
As long as I can remember,
I have followed you
from room to room.
I can't remember a single time
you have come to me.
Can you?
What are you talking about?
I don't mind living
in Roald Amundsen's shadow.
But not when you hide things from me,
risk other people's lives.
Not one life has been lost.
- That depends.
- On what?
You still owe $20,000
for the other planes.
Are you aware of that?
No.
Yet you just ordered new ones?
We don't have that money.
I can't raise any more.
I have lent you 100,000 kroner
from my own pocket.
- And you give our properties to Kiss?
- I want her to have a home.
A home?
She's one of the wealthiest women
in England!
I have a family to worry about.
Strictly speaking,
so does Kiss Bennett.
I don't recognize you anymore.
No one does.
What kind of captain
leaves Maud and the expedition,
comes home with two
innocent children, and lies?
You're right.
I lie.
I do, Leon.
What did you think?
That I told you everything?
Like before?
How would that go, Leon?
Hm?
What would I have achieved
if I had done that?
Nothing.
You would only have said no.
You don't dare anymore.
You've become a coward.
I...
I can no longer manage your finances.
I'll waive my powers of attorney.
Find someone else.
Let me know who, and I'll send a claim
for the money you owe.
Leon!
And...
that was the last time
I saw him.
Hi!
Of course,
Roald didn't follow my advice,
and ordered the planes anyway.
Now he's bankrupt
and missing.
I sense a note of satisfaction
in your voice.
It was a tragedy.
Very shameful.
He had no one.
And then the bankruptcy,
it nearly killed him.
Do you know anyone else
who could come back from that?
It's just money, Leon.
- What do you mean?
- It's just money.
- No, it's not just money.
- Yes.
He risks everything
to do what no man
has ever done before,
and you, you're talking
about a house.
Maybe he gave you
that impression,
but my brother
is not the victim here.
There were casualties,
you know.
Yes. Hjalmar.
Not just Hjalmar.
There were others.
Some of the crew.
The Maud expedition lasted
for seven years.
Seven.
In that time,
several men had left
or just...
disappeared.
What do you mean, disappeared?
Tessem and Knudsen.
They went on
an 800-kilometer trip from Maud,
over the ice to the mainland,
but they never arrived.
Remains of a campfire
were found,
along with charred bones.
It was assumed that either
Tessem and Knudsen had died
and that the other
had cremated the corpse.
Later, a mummified body
was found
on the mainland shore,
across from Dickson Island.
Died only three kilometers
from the weather station.
Seeing its lights
as he fell down and...
died of exhaustion.
Meanwhile, Roald was having
hot baths in luxury hotels
and flying planes,
and traveling...
He was stuck in the ice
for three years.
Sverdrup, Olonkin and Wisting
remained on Maud
for seven years,
until the ship got arrested
when it came to land,
due to Roald's bankruptcy.
You know...
Wisting,
he had seven children,
but three of them
got sick and died at home
while he was stuck
in the ice.
Still, he was faithful
to his captain.
Refused to let the ship
get arrested by creditors.
These were grown men.
They knew what
they signed up for.
Then there were
the little girls.
He loves them.
He sent them away, Bess.
He had to.
Bess...
There's something
I think you should know.
Roald told me of a letter
from Kiss.
He was waiting for her.
With the girls.
She broke it off.
He had no choice.
He had to send them away.
Who do you think looked after
the girls when Roald was gone?
It was us most of the time.
He didn't care.
They had two years of school here,
and then he...
he put them on a boat
back to Siberia.
What kind of person does that?
You're twisting things around.
You see that banner behind me?
"All for Norway."
"All for Roald" is more like it.
He's like a child.
He only cares about one thing.
The North Pole.
Himself.
He's your brother.
He's out there somewhere.
You should be
praying for him.
He's probably happy now.
Dying like a martyr in the ice
together with his men,
like in the... stupid adventure books
we used to read.
I don't understand you.
Why are you so angry?
- I told you.
- You say you hate him.
But here you are.
You expected him
to come back.
Didn't you?
You're waiting.
That's why you're snooping
around here.
That's why you still
live next door.
You're mad at him
because he manages without you.
That's rubbish.
You're mad at him
because if it wasn't for Roald,
you'd be off somewhere
importing wine or something.
And he would have still
made history anyway.
- With or without you.
- I don't have to listen to this.
{\an8}ARCTIC OCEAN,
251 KM FROM NORTH POLE
Dietrichson?
Riiser-Larsen?
Ellsworth, Feucht.
Everybody.
It's enough now.
This is it.
We have done all we can.
And you...
have done more
than I could ever ask.
We have been trying for weeks
to build a runway,
and the one we have now is not
even close to long enough.
But there's no more food.
And it will have to do.
We didn't make it
to the North Pole.
But we will make it home.
I've seen things like this
end well.
Many times.
It is what it is.
Amundsen.
{\an8}CITY HALL PIER, OSLO
JULY 5, 1925
They love you even more
now that you've risen from the dead.
{\an8}THE ROYAL PALACE, OSLO
{\an8}- Thank you.
- It's so good to see you again.
{\an8}It's good to see you again.
Impressive!
Congratulations,
Mr. Amundsen.
- We had the worst of fears.
- Thank you.
We'll see you shortly.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Captain!
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
- I see a few new gray hairs.
- Yes, it was quite rough.
- Just remember to...
- I know. I know.
I'm a married woman.
I'll be discreet.
You can talk more later,
in private.
This was very...
It was special.
We are going to...
You look very well
for a dead man...
Captain.
How... How did... How...?
It's...
good to have you back.
Congratulations!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Most impressive.
Thank you.
We should go.
So, tell me,
does Kiss still own
all of this?
You shouldn't listen
to my brother.
He doesn't understand people
like you and me.
He lives in a very
small world.
And if it's about funds,
I-I am getting money.
I guarantee it.
There will be a book.
You saw how they greeted me now.
I-I will get financing
for sure.
Do you think I care
about money?
Do you think that's what
this is about?
I...
I want to say something.
It has always
been easier for me...
than the others...
to be alone out there.
You know, to me, it...
it's just beautiful,
you know?
But this time,
I was scared.
I thought I would
never see you...
again.
You started something
you needed to finish.
I understand that.
Once you've done it...
once you've seen what lies
beyond the North Pole...
I will marry you.
But if I do this...
If I go and get my divorce...
promise...
whatever we do...
we do it together.
I promise.
Oh, I promise.
There's this...
Italian engineer.
He has constructed
an airship.
The plan is good. Much safer.
Like sitting in an armchair.
The problem is,
Mussolini wants it to be
an Italian expedition
with me onboard.
- Mm.
- Can you imagine?
So you... Wait, shut up.
You're going to reach
the North Pole
in an armchair?
I am an old man.
I noticed.
Do you think I'll find it
up there?
Oh, yes.
You've wanted this
your entire life.
You've never given up.
Most people, they give up
on their dreams.
Let them die.
Not you.
And you dream
bigger than everyone.
You will find
what you are looking for.
I know it.
And then...
- ...and then...
- And then.
I guess someone...
has to find out if Santa Claus
really lives up there.
Oh, yes.
But I won't be sailing
under an Italian flag,
I can tell you that.
{\an8}THE AIRSHIP NORGE, THE ARCTIC
MAY 11, 1926
Captain?
We are only a few minutes away.
- Have you seen anything?
- No.
Nothing but ice.
Captain?
Are we there?
Mm-hm.
Everybody?
It's 22 minutes
past midnight.
On the 12th of May, 1926.
And we have reached
the North Pole.
- Congratulations.
- Ellsworth.
Nobile.
Mr. Nobile, do you think
you could have done it
without the help
of Captain Amundsen here?
Amundsen is a great explorer.
But let's not forget
this is an Italian airship.
Italian technology
and funding.
It is why I am planning
a new expedition
with an airship called Italia,
and I will be the captain.
I stood there on that airship,
with the Italian and that damn dog.
And suddenly...
Suddenly it was...
over.
Done.
Over and done.
No more white spots on the map.
You are much more than that, Roald.
There's much left to achieve.
In medicine.
Technology.
In politics.
Hm.
I hear you're writing a book.
Who has said that?
Someone who cares about you.
Wisting?
He said you may be angry
with the English.
With Nobile.
Even with your own brother.
And I thought:
Is there a worse time
to write an autobiography?
Fridtjof Nansen. Always ready to help
whoever it may be.
What will you call it?
"My Life as an Explorer".
- Explorer?
- Yes.
But think about what I said.
We still need a good relationship
with the English.
In my experience,
the English,
by and large,
are a breed of poor losers.
This is exactly what I mean, Roald.
If I could have one wish,
I would want Scott to survive.
Then he would simply be number two.
The loser.
Instead they made him a martyr
and me the villain
who beat him.
I won, but was made a villain.
And I have always lived according to
the strictest code of honor.
I planned the South Pole so well
that I made it look easy.
That's the biggest mistake
I've ever made.
A book...
is forever.
{\an8}MY LIFE AS AN EXPLORER
Leon?
Leon?
Have you finished it?
Yes.
He castigates everyone.
The English.
Scott.
Nobile.
Hardangervidda, when I saved his life.
"I was frozen stuck in a block of ice."
"I struggled to free myself,
but to no avail."
"I cried out for my..."
"...companion."
That's all that's left of me.
A companion with no name.
My dear, are you crying?
First to spend the winter in Antarctica.
First through the Northwest Passage.
First on the South Pole.
First to circumnavigate
the entire Arctic Ocean.
First to navigate the Northwest
and Northeast Passage.
And the crowning glory:
First to fly over the polar ice cap,
between the North Pole and Alaska.
And thus, first on both poles.
In brief:
The greatest polar explorer
in history!
{\an8}AFTENPOSTEN NEWSPAPER, OSLO
MAY 26, 1928
Wisting?
Captain?
Nansen.
Where...
Where is he?
- And the King and Queen?
- They sent their apologies.
Because of that damn book.
I knew it.
And Bess isn't here either.
She'll be back soon.
As you all know,
Umberto Nobile has set out
on a new Arctic expedition.
But his airship has gone missing.
A cyclone has struck
the west coast of Spitsbergen.
Most likely blowing the ship eastwards.
The rescue operation must be by plane.
But no airplane has ever succeeded
at crossing this area.
I will be the first.
Mr. Amundsen, I'm sure everyone
here would like to know,
our international guests
as well as us Norwegians,
will you take part in the search
and rescue of Umberto Nobile?
Yes, sir.
Right away.
Amundsen?
Amundsen?
{\an8}TROMSØ, NORWAY
JUNE 18, 1928
Congratulations.
That was...
Oh.
Bess Magids.
Amundsen.
Captain Amundsen.
Well, Captain,
you play poker?
What happened?
He's gone, Bess.
He...
Nobile went missing,
and Roald took a plane
to find him.
Why?
The... plane went down somewhere.
I'm so sorry, I...
I should have been there. I...
I could have stopped him.
Nobody could have.
{\an8}ROALD AMUNDSEN DISAPPEARED
ON JUNE 18, 1928, AT THE AGE OF 56.
{\an8}HE WAS NEVER FOUND.
