THE QUANTITY IS DOWN
THEY'RE BARELY LAYING ANY NEW EGGS
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE?

- Mom?
- Uh-huh?
It's almost 9:00.
Are you taking me to soccer?
Laura!
- Laura?
- Yeah?
Your brother's waiting.
He's gonna be late for practice.
- Come on, it's Saturday.
- I need your help.
I'm trying to finish up in the lab
before Briand gets here.
- She doesn't care.
- Laura!
Could you go any slower?
- They started already.
- So go ahead.
Inside, outside,
keeping the ball close.
Go for that control.
Come back and go through it again.
Looks good.
- Pretend to pull the defender.
- Psst.
Look ahead, look to the sides.
Try to see what's going on on the field.
Psst.
- So locusts like classical music?
- I hope so.
- How's it going?
- All right.
- Are you thirsty?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
I just grilled some.
Do you want a taste?
Hm.
- Ta-da.
- Thanks.
Cheers. Hm.
Hm.
Hmm.
- Ginger.
- Close.
- Smoked paprika and ginger.
- Ah.
It's pretty good, huh?
I'm open to suggestions.
What's that? Gelatin?
Yeah, it's to try
to keep them from drowning.
It's better to use jelly
instead of a water dish.
So, how many do you have?
I'm up to four now.
You're quiet.
Is there a problem?
Six months ago
you promised me a whole lot more.
You sure?
I promised?
You could've told me over the phone.
The minimum I need is four times that.
If I can't sell it cheaper,
then it's not worth it.
Did Briand come by?
Yes.
- And?
- And nothing.
He'll only buy bigger quantities.
What's your plan then?
I don't know.
Don't tell your brother, okay?
Mm-hmm.
You mind
finishing up without me?
No.
I was wondering if you could, uh,
lend me a bit more money.
I need to make it
till the end of the month.
Yeah, sure. No problem
How much do you need, exactly?
I'm not sure.
Around 500, just to be safe.
Yeah, I'll stop by later.Uh...
- You sure that's enough?
- I'm sure, thanks. I'll manage.
Can you keep this to yourself?
Oh yeah, absolutely. It's just between us.
You're a lifesaver.
- I mean it.
- I know.
Thanks.
- See you later.
- See you.
- Hey, Pascal, it's Karim.
- Hey, what's up?
- The usual.
- How are your wines?
- Um, okay, I guess.
- How are you?
I've never been better.
But I'm actually calling to see
if you might have any friends
or colleagues looking for meal.
I might.
Depends what it's made from.
Locusts.
Locust? Oh, yeah, high protein.
Exactly. It's high in protein.
It's great quality.
What's the going rate for this stuff?
I'm not really sure.
It's around five per kilo.
- How much?
- Around five a kilo.
Oh, that's not much.
I don't know much about it.
It's not what we're really interested in.
Do you know anyone who would be?
I'll ask around
and get back to you.
Okay, yeah. That would be great.
Thanks a lot.
- Make sure the lamps are on please.
- I will.
- Gaston!
- Yeah?
- Lights off upstairs.
- In both our rooms?
Yes.
I don't want the power to go out again.
- Are you sure it's closed?
- Yeah.
Hey, how did soccer go this morning?
- He was getting wheezy again.
- Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Coach says he needs
an answer about camp soon.
What do you want me to tell him?
- I don't know yet.
- Okay.
- You hungry?
- Kinda.
I can make pasta.
Yeah, like we never have that.
- I'm going for it.
- Yeah.
- Hold on.
- Come on. Let's go.
Gotta put my serious face on.
Hi, everyone.
Today we are making a new video.
Starring my favorite new treat,
the crispy locust crepe.
- Mmm.
- Give me some.
- You want a leg?
- Ew. Oh my God. That's gross.
I wanna send
a special thanks to Laura's mom.
- She's the locust queen. Mmm.
- Queen of the locusts!
Oh my God! Ugh!
Dude, that's disgusting! Oh!
I can translate the website
into different languages.
If I can increase online sales,
we can stop selling to stores.
Hey, hand me another box, please.
Load those in the car for me, would you?
Sure, boss.
Laura,
don't speak to me like that.
It's a sign of respect.
- Okay.
- Okay.
So how will you manage this week?
I don't know.
Take the bus, I guess.
Did you know the locusts ate my wart off?
Gaston, why do you always
have to be so gross?
Why can't you leave
that thing alone?
You guys coming with me?
Okay.
Gaston, close the trunk, please?
Thanks.
I'll just be a few minutes, okay?
I need food.
Laura?
Isn't that Kevin, the asshole?
- Hey, locust girl.
- Hey, shithead.
Wow, that's classy.
- What's pissing you off?
- You are.
I'm pissing you off
while I'm just hanging out over here?
- Your new video completely sucks.
- My video is getting tons of likes.
So locust girl is pissed.
Not your kind of humor?
Well, if your feelings got hurt,
I didn't mean it. It's not personal.
Your sister looks better
with a smile on her face.
But I get why you're pissed.
Everybody gets it
with your mom going kind of batshit.
What are you talking about?
If my dad hung himself in the goat pen,
I'd be pissed off too.
- You asshole!
- Laura!
What the hell? Take it easy!
- Stop it!
- Come on, calm down.
Stop it!
Get off me!
Let go!
- You like that?
- Come on, man, knock it off.
That's enough!
- Enough!
- Let's just get out of here.
Look at her. She's out of control.
- Calm down!
- Okay, that's enough. Let it go.
If you ever touch her again,
you'll have to deal with me. You got it?
Just deal with your daughter.
- It's bleeding like crazy.
- Did he hurt you?
No. I fell down.
- Why were they fighting?
- They said something about Dad.
Laura!
- Hey, what is that thing?
- A bandage.
- You need me to carry you?
- No, I'm fine.
Let's get inside.
We need to clean that up.
The water is freezing.
I'm sick of those crappy solar panels!
- Laura, give it a rest.
- Aren't you sick of it?
Aren't you sick of leaving
your clothes all over the floor?
I hate to live in this shithole.
It stinks, it's filthy,
and I can't even take a shower.
Everything is filthy. It's disgusting.
- Aren't you being a bit dramatic?
- No, I'm not being dramatic.
I'm sick of everybody making fun of us.
At least the goats
didn't make us look like freaks.
When you've calmed down,
meet me in the kitchen, please.
- Six-fifty?
- Yeah.
I can't.
No way. Are you kidding?
I'm better off selling it retail.
950 is the absolute lowest I can go.
I can't do eight. Yeah, I understand.
I have a family to feed too.
It's the best I can do.
Well, I'll have to get back to you.
I have some other people to talk to, so...
Okay. Let me know.
I'll think about it.
- Yeah, call me back.
- I'll let you know. Thanks.
You should put some ice one that
so it doesn't swell up.
Show me.
He didn't hold back, did he?
What a little asshole.
Keep this on for ten minutes.
You'll feel better.
I'll leave it here for you.
I talked to someone
about a bulk order earlier.
- Who is it?
- I haven't met him yet, but...
He'll buy it all.
Did you get a good price?
Not what I'd hoped for.
If I sold all the equipment,
I think I'd be able to start over.
We could start from scratch.
Hm?
Sure.
- Here?
- Maybe not.
Maybe somewhere new
where the three of us can be happy.
You got any ideas?
You don't have to tell me
right this minute.
We'll figure it out.
- Right.
- Hm.
- I need to call Karim about the power.
- Mom!
- The power's out again!
- I'll be right there! Don't worry.
I thought
we were playing outside.
- Come down soon?
- I will.
- Mom!
- Coming!
- Here you go.
- Gaston, you paying attention?
- Hold on a second.
- No stalling.
Huguette decided
this was a good place to pee.
No!
- Yeah, she did.
- Again?
- At least it's not poop.
- Yuck!
Have her get down.
She shouldn't be on there.
Get down.
Give her some chips.
No goat can resist chips.
Oh, so that's all it takes
for you to love me.
- Blocking you. I'm playing red.
- What? Hold on.
Where are you going?
- I'll be back.
- Hey, I won!
Write it
on the score sheet, then.
- Oh, I got it. I got.
- It's my turn.
Why can't you just ignore him?
Laura.
- What's up?
- All good. You?
You asking him out or what?
- You jealous?
- Why are you even talking to us?
I'll be out of here in a month.
- Yeah, so?
- So,
I'll be far away from you morons.
You should move to Brittany.
They love their crepes up there.
- Is there a problem?
- It's a bit too fine.
Could you make the next batch coarser?
- Yes, of course.
- I have some chicks hatching any day.
But this will get me by.
Who do I make it out to?
You.
- Yep?
- What name on the check?
I prefer cash.
Don't we all.
But I only brought checks.
That really doesn't work for me.
I can do a transfer
through the co-op if you want.
A check is fine.
Hm.
I'm listening.
Hebrard.
Hebrard. H-E-B-R-A-R-D.
There you go.
I guess you owe your friend one
for getting me to buy all this.
I'm sorry?
I said you owe him for getting me
to take this off your hands.
I'm not deaf.
I just don't get what you mean by that.
Well, I'm paying 200.
And he's paying the rest.
- Who is he?
- Your buddy.
The winemaker.
Two hundred for all of this?
Yeah.
You know I'm feeding ducks, not people.
- Two hundred is ridiculously cheap.
- If you say so...
Why even bother?
- What the hell? Hey!
- This is robbery.
- What are you, nuts?
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping it.
- Get out of my van!
- Get you hand off of me.
- You're out of your mind!
- Get out of here.
- Gladly.
I'm not working for peanuts.
Gaston, come on.
You're not even trying.
- They're fine.
- This one's still dirty.
- It's fine.
- You blind? There's food on it.
Your son is a lazy moron.
An idiot could do better than this.
Hey!
Did you hear her? She called me an idiot.
What?
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
You don't look like it.
I was just thinking.
Do you want help?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Here.
You really love doing dishes.
Yeah.
It's a job.
- The nosy neighbor is here.
- Again?
Jackie!
I'll go. Here, you finish up.
- Okay.
- Get over here, boy.
Mr. Duvivier,
did you lose your dog again?
He's not lost.
He just likes to wander over.
It's the fourth time
this month, you know?
Sorry to bother you.
Have a good day.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Ah!
Get over here, you naughty little bugger.
Let's go.
This way. Stay with me.
The duck guy says you had a fit.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You should have asked me first.
I owe you enough money already.
So? Don't worry about it.
I live alone, I barely cook.
There'd be no vineyard
without you and Nico.
What do you think the reaction was
when I moved here?
"Let's rent to the Arab guy.
He looks really nice."
What?
- Did you really believe in it?
- Don't.
Come on. I really want to know.
There's more protein in 100 grams
of locust than in 150 of meat.
I know.
I've heard the sales pitch.
Pretty soon
the entire planet will be starving,
but you're all too dumb to notice.
Don't you miss working as a nurse
at the old folks home?
Nurse's aide. Big difference.
What did you do to your arm?
Oh... Oh, that's nothing.
I just burnt myself earlier.
I gotta go.
See you later?
Damn it!
Hey!
Gaston!
You forgot to take your sweatshirt.
I would've grabbed it
on my way out.
I packed your school stuff.
- French, History, Geo, English.
- Thanks, but no English today.
Bring it with you to study, then.
You need it.
Um, there's plenty of time
before we have to go.
That's what you always say
and then you're late.
- Nah-uh.
- Please.
- Damn.
- Hurry up.
You're gonna miss the bus.
- Are you finished with that?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I guess we should hurry up.
Have a good day.
- Thanks.
- You too.
See you later.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
Mom? We're home.
Hello?
What are you doing?
Just cleaning.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. How was school?
The usual.
How come you're home so early?
I told you they canceled game.
Oh, I forgot.
- Are you coming down soon?
- Yes
Is that good?
Hm?
I think my minute's up.
You've been counting?
You can stop. What is it?
Sixty eight. Is that better?
Sixty eight? Way better.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm. Good job.
You've need to get some sleep now.
All right.
- Sweet dreams.
- You too.
Why are they so loud tonight?
They take after you.
They don't want to go to bed.
Laura, you need to get off your phone!
You really need this much space?
I have to separate some of the ones
laying eggs in the dome
and spread them out
so they have more room to breathe.
Hold on. Okay, got it.
- You on?
- Just a sec.
Got it.
Break?
That's good. Okay, stop.
- Good?
- Thanks.
Scissors?
Take your pick.
Come on, pull!
Hey, Mom!
- Hi! How was your day?
- Good.
- Hey, Gaston.
- Hey.
What is this?
I'll let your mother explain it.
What's going on?
- We're expanding.
- Really?
- Why?
- 'Cause they started laying like crazy.
Seriously?
- Can I see?
- Now?
- You're taking me?
- Sure.
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead.
- You wanna come?
- No.
I'll race you.
- Are you alright?
- Oh yeah.
- You could have fooled me.
- Everything's fine.
Hold on.
I don't want you barging in.
- Wait.
- Why not?
New rules.
You can't wear
your regular clothes in there.
Wow!
- Have they gotten bigger?
- Yes.
Cool.
- Did you change something?
- I'm giving them parsley.
- They like parsley?
- Yep.
- Well, it works.
- Mm-hmm.
But no more going in there
without me, got it?
Got it.
- Can I grab a few for my room?
- Sure.
Amazing.
- So go get me your box.
- I'm going.
Laura.
Do you see?
Who cares, Gaston?
It looks like it's getting lift off.
- What's the matter with you?
- You must think I'm an idiot.
- I beg your pardon?
- You told me we were moving.
- We're moving?
- Not anymore. She lied to me.
- Where were we going?
- We're not moving.
- The timing is not right anyway.
- Why not?
Because...
I owe money, for one thing.
So sell the farm to pay off your debts.
We're not selling, and you're
upsetting your brother for nothing.
It would mean that we failed.
No. It would mean that you failed.
I don't give a shit about this farm, Mom!
- Hm, really?
- The place smells like death.
- Are you happy now?
- Give me one reason you're doing this?
One reason? I'm doing it for you.
Because you need food
and school and clothes.
No. That's bullshit, Mom. You have no idea
what's even happening in our lives.
- You've no right to pretend you care!
- How dare you?
You know you're dreaming.
Can you stop doubting me for two seconds?
Do you think I can do it?
Sure.
Come on.
Laura.
Is the power out again?
The shoots are tiny.
I'm screwed. Look...
Damn it.
The last thing I needed was a drought.
So your wine won't be as good?
No, it shouldn't affect quality,
but the yield will be lower.
- At least I already have a buyer.
- You do?
Mm-hmm.
That's good, right?
It could be a catch-22.
If he's my only buyer,
he could lowball me next year.
I have all my eggs in one basket.
Nah. It smells like trouble.
- I have a stall at the market.
- Really?
- You could set up next to me.
- No.
Do you have a better idea?
I'll probably give
the duck farmer another shot.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
- The organic co-op thing is over?
- It's not worth it.
I'm gonna concentrate on feed meal.
- That's hard work!
- I know.
- You'll need to up production.
- I did the math.
Do you need anything?
I'm good. Thanks.
You think you can make it?
Good question.
If it doesn't rain soon,
will you make it?
What choice do I have?
Hm. I'm almost finished here.
Wait for me?
I have to be up really early.
We get up at the same time,
you know?
Good morning.
If you're here for foie gras,
you'll have to come back later.
We're not open yet.
- Five hundred for all of it.
- Seriously?
- How much is there?
- A hundred and fifty kilos.
- Same as before?
- Better.
- Coarsed it up a bit?
- Yep.
Hm.
Next time,
don't bother with the cute little baggies.
It's a pain in the ass for storage.
Use the 50-kilo bags instead.
Here. Three hundred's all I have today.
Don't look so happy.
Hebrard, with a "D". A-R-D.
Yes.
Yes, exactly.
Thirty liters. Whatever blood you have.
Yes.
I know but I'm kind of in a rush.
Can I come pick it up with some coolers?
That would be great. I'll be here.
Shh!
- Mrs. Hebrard?
- Yes?
I have your order.
Hello.
- Thirty liters, right?
- Yes.
- What are those?
- They are locusts.
- Really?
- I farm them for meal.
- For feed?
- Yeah.
- And you feed them blood?
- Uh-huh.
Laura?
Laura!
Laura!
We just have a few more to fill.
Do you mind grilling these?
I'll be going to the post office later.
Do you want to come with me?
If you insist.
Hey, Huguette.
Easy.
Easy.
♪ Catch me sippin' that spicy ♪
♪ Ice cubes in my iced tea ♪
♪ Chickens that are feisty ♪
♪ See me rolling with wifey ♪
Oh, it's you.
- Is your mom with the bugs?
- Post office.
Why are you here?
Uh, I was worried about you.
You have my number.
You never pick up.
I went by the greenhouses earlier.
They're buzzing.
That's what's bothering you?
Well, a bit. Doesn't it bother you?
They screech.
Are you still going to move?
- Go play somewhere else.
- Why?
'Cause I said.
- Huguette.
- Get her out of here!
All right!
You're such a pain.
Come on, girl. I have an idea.
Laura.
Knock it off.
Huguette!
Huguette!
No! No!
Mom!
Mom!
What's wrong?
- They're out.
- What's out?
- The locusts.
- What?
They swarmed the pickup.
Huguette got scared and ran away.
- Where did she go?
- She just ran.
- Where is your sister?
- I can't find her either.
- I'm going to find Huguette.
- You stay here!
Laura!
Yeah?
What the hell is going on?
Go home, Luc.
Get in the house.
Watch your brother!
- Did you find her?
- Sorry.
- She must be hiding.
- This sucks!
Gaston.
She'll come home soon, honey.
We'll go looking for her again later.
Try not to worry. She knows the way home.
Did you trash the greenhouse?
Huh?
Don't pretend you ever gave a shit
about the goats.
I asked you
if you ripped up the greenhouse.
Yes, Mom. I lost it because I can't stand
those fucking things anymore.
- Stop!
- Go to your room. Now!
Mom!
- Let go. Let go!
- Get off of me.
- Mom!
- Mom, you're hurting me!
Huguette!
Huguette!
Do you want to get out
of the car for a bit?
Huguette!
Huguette!
Huguette!
Hey there.
Did you sleep all right?
Is Gaston awake?
No clue.
I was thinking
we could go for a picnic.
- Don't you have work to do?
- Yes, but...
The weather is gorgeous.
It'd be a shame not to enjoy it.
Can you get your brother up
when you're finished?
And bring your bathing suits.
- The water is too cold at the lake.
- We're not going to the lake.
I love picnics. Don't you?
Yep.
You wanna try these cookies?
Maybe later. I'm stuffed.
- They look yummy, though.
- Laura?
I'm full too.
Is soccer camp still on?
Yeah, it's next week.
And when you're playing,
does it still hurt you here?
Mm, no.
He's lying.
He gets it every time he plays.
No.
Why are you asking?
Do you want me
to call your coach
and tell him that you're gonna be there?
This is the best day ever.
Hold on. Are you kidding?
Only if you're lying
about the breathing thing.
No, no, no. It's 100%.
- You're serious?
- 100%.
Oh my God. Holy cow.
I've got to cool off.
Hey, splash some water
on the back of your neck first.
- I will. Are you coming?
- In a sec.
Aren't you hot?
No.
There's a good breeze.
Your brother is waiting for you.
I know.
Why don't you come?
I might join you.
After I eat all of these.
Knock yourself out.
Did Karim get a new scooter?
- Hey, Karim.
- How's it going?
- I'm good. You?
- Fantastic.
When did you get that?
It's not mine, actually.
There is a tag on it.
"Laura Hebrard."
- Ring a bell?
- Hm... It sounds so familiar.
- No way!
- Congratulations!
Oh my God.
I'm just the delivery guy.
You can thank that lady.
- This is the one you wanted.
- Well, yeah.
- What do you think? Try it out.
- I'm shocked.
- Can I try it?
- Of course.
- How do I get it going?
- Hold on. I'll give you a push.
- Okay.
- Ready? One, two, three. There you go.
- Like this?
- You got it.
- Slowly.
- Yeah, don't worry!
- How is it?
- Awesome.
So?
What's the verdict?
I'm not sure.
It's simple. Drinkable.
That's harsh.
You wanted honesty.
Honesty is great.
How about a little nuance?
Something like...
"In spite of its simplicity,
it was clearly made by a good guy."
"And he made it with heart."
"And fiery passion."
Because wine is passion.
I mean it. It's like love.
You have to take a risk.
And if someone takes you up on it,
then that's your reward.
Isn't it? Do you taste that?
Hm. Yes.
- Aren't you hot?
- It's kind of cold.
Hm.
It's nice, though.
I can't. I can't, I'm sorry.
- I have to go.
- Sure.
It was 50 liters. Right.
Hebrard. H-E-B-R-A-R-D.
What do you mean
you can't do it?
I explained all this the other day.
They can't find my license in the system.
Of course I've been in touch
with the Farm Bureau.
Waiting list? And what
am I supposed to do until then, huh?
You and your goddamn red tape
are going to put me out of business.
Hello? Fucking assholes!
- Ma'am?
- Yes?
Got a minute?
I wanted to check in with you
before we set up the second frame
I'm trying to avoid boxing you in.
- I need to be able to drive through there.
- Right.
Let's set it up right this way,
behind the truck.
Okay, but the tree is in the way.
Not for long.
What are you doing?
- Wait a minute.
- You stay there, Gaston.
- But that's Huguette's favorite.
- There are plenty of other trees.
- No, Mom. Come on.
- Don't come any closer, please.
Stop it.
It doesn't matter.
We'll tie her up over there!
This isn't fair. You didn't even ask me.
Stop it!
Wow!
It's huge.
I thought Marsiac was pulling my leg
when he told me you put in two more.
He wasn't. Why did he tell you?
Because everybody thinks
your business is a little creepy.
No offense.
Could you just leave that?
Should I go, Virginie?
Next time, can you call
before you come over, please?
I'd rather you not just drop in.
It interrupts my work.
Jackie?
Jackie!
Hey, Jackie!
Come!
Mom?
Yes?
I can't find
Gaston's soccer shorts.
I just washed them, Laura.
- What's that smell?
- They're molting.
- Can I see?
- Later, sweetheart. It's a mess.
Who's that?
The duck farmer.
The burly guy?
Yeah, but there's two of them.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Surviving?
- I skipped a few meals.
- I bet. I've been there myself.
- Hi.
Hi.
Guillaume. He lives in Brimont.
He's helping me out today.
He runs a place
with around, uh, 1,200 head.
- Right?
- I do have partners.
What do you think?
Well, it's interesting.
It's pretty compact. I, uh...
- You added more?
- ...I can do 200 per greenhouse.
Yeah, 250. I can increase volume.
And there's space to put in another one.
- And over there?
- That's basically where I do lab work.
- Do you want to see?
- Sure.
And one T-shirt per day.
You're all set.
I thought you'd be more excited.
Me too.
You're gonna have a great time.
What if I get lonely?
You'd rather stay here?
You'll be with all your soccer buddies.
Anyway, you have
to get away from this place.
Why do you say that?
Hm?
How come?
Did you forget about Gaston?
You take him.
I'll meet you there.
- Gaston!
- Yeah?
We're taking the scooter.
Let's go!
Coming!
- Did she answer?
- Voicemail.
I'm sure everything's fine. You should go.
- What if it's not fine?
- Gaston!
- Why isn't she here?
- Just get on the bus.
- She should be here.
- She's exhausted. You know that.
Stop worrying about her.
Look, you gotta get a move on.
I'm not going.
I swear to you, nothing is the matter.
She's just busy.
I want to stay with you and mom.
You're going. You wanted
to go to this camp forever.
Stop being such a baby
and get out of here.
Bye! Bye, lovey. Okay.
Mom!
You in there?
Mom?
Mommy?
Sweetheart?
Let me in. Please.
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MOM
COME OVER
COME!
Virginie?
Virginie?
- Hey there.
- What are you doing here?
Just checking up on you.
I sent a bunch of texts.
I didn't see them.
How are you?
Frustrated, actually.
I can't fix this stupid machine.
- Is Laura here? It's pretty quiet.
- I don't know.
Can you try it? Hold it here.
I'll give it one more shot.
- So? Any better?
- No, it's not.
I think it's stuck.
All right. Never mind.
I'll take it in tomorrow to get fixed.
Give me a minute.
Whoa! Hold on.
Virginie!
What have you done to yourself?
I've got you. Don't worry. It's all right.
Let's sit for a minute.
Hold on. Almost there.
Good.
It's okay. It's okay. Everything's fine.
- Just breathe. I'm here.
- Okay...
- All right. I'm good.
- You almost passed out.
You're fine. You're fine. You're fine.
You're exhausted. That's...
How about we get a bite to eat, huh?
Laura!
We're gonna go to my house.
Virginie, sit.
Take a load off.
Introducing my video projector.
It's the first thing I set up
when I moved in here.
Pretty cool, huh?
And you know what else?
It's practical.
We can watch something
and have dinner at the same time.
Oh...
You okay?
Laura.
We're family. You know that. Hm?
Tell me what's the matter.
The locusts.
What's wrong with them?
You won't believe me.
Are we talking
about the locusts or you mom?
- I wanna help.
- Why are you whispering?
We weren't whispering, Virginie.
I'm just checking in.
Did you learn anything new?
Laura?
- What's going on?
- Why don't you tell me?
Your daughter is a mess.
Can't you see that?
Do you even care?
You need to tell me
what the hell is going on.
I'm willing to help you,
but not if you keep me in the dark.
I've heard enough.
- We're going home.
- I'm trying to help.
I want to stay here!
You're not going anywhere
until you tell me why she's afraid of you.
You're a wreck, for fuck's sake!
We're leaving.
- Don't... Listen...
- Let's go. Don't touch me!
Jackie?
Karim?
What's wrong?
What happened?
Karim!
Laura!
Karim is acting crazy.
What did you tell him?
- Nothing!
- Open the door! Stop.
I just want to know what you said.
- Nothing!
- I don't believe you.
- Mom.
- What?
Mom, no!
Virginie!
Virginie, don't!
Come on! It's gone.
Get off!
- Get off!
- Come on!
It's better this way.
Stop it!
You had no right!
Don't!
- Mom!
- Let it burn!
No! No!
Oh my God!
Mom!
Get inside!
Virginie!
Come on!
Get inside! Laura, get in!
Close all the windows! Hurry!
Turn off the lights!
All of them.
Laura, close all the doors.
Stay where you are!
Mom!
Laura!
I'm coming!
Where are you?
Mom!
- Where are you?
- Mom!
Wait!
Laura!
Answer me!
Laura!
Where are you?
Laura!
Mom!
Help! Help! Help! Help me!
Laura!
Laura!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom! Help! Help me!
Laura!
Mom!
Mom!
Come back!
Oh my God!
Mom!
Mom!
