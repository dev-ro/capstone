Gatekeeper, this is Mothership.
The Four Horsemen are on the gallop.
You are a go to open the stable door.
I repeat, open the stable door.
The payload is secure,
and the Horsemen are en route.
Make sure I look cute.
- Whoo!
- Get in here.
Vegas, baby.
Vegas!
Go, baby. Yeah.
- We did it!
- Yeah.
I think it went. Go, baby.
Let's go. Let's go.
Whoo!
- Get out of here!
- Yeah!
♪ I can't walk out ♪
I love life, bitches!
Love, love, love…
What are you doing?
Get in here. I feel it!
Any idea
what the hell we're hauling?
Why we need
all this firepower to protect it?
Could be anything
from a briefcase nuke
to the original copy of the Constitution
but the one written
in the Founding Fathers' blood.
Right. Or like, uh…
…Bigfoot.
I was thinking more like
headpiece to the Staff of Ra
or, uh, Amelia Earhart but alive.
- So, the less you know, the better.
- True.
I got you a little present for making
an honest woman out of me.
Okay. What?
Wait, what are you talking about?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Get in there. All right.
You are in trouble now, mister.

♪ I'm crying ♪
♪ Yes, I'm crying ♪
All right, I've got one.
How about the lunar lander
that was supposedly left on the moon?
Yeah, I like
the thematic extraterrestrial reference,
seeing as we're just coming
from, uh… Well, you know.
- So you're saying there's a chance.
- Chance of what?
Chance we're hauling a… Well, you know.
The Holy Grail.
Yeah, could be the Grail.
Not the "Grail" Grail
but the Holy Grail of things
we shouldn't be hauling.
You're gonna just make me say it out loud?
I honestly don't…
I mean, you're being cryptic.
Oh, wow.
Area 51.
Secret hangar. Autopsy.
All right, I'll say it. It's an alien.
- Oh, my God!
- Look out!
Blackwing's hurt.
Come on, guys. Hustle up.
- Let's get this thing out!
- Hurry up!
Get this one. Hustle, hustle.
Multiple DOAs, sir.
Never mind. They're dead in there.
Let's get to this one. Come on.
- Guys, get to payload two!
- Copy that!
Mothership, this is
the Four Horsemen. Do you copy?
Copy. Go ahead, Horsemen.
We're in an emergency situation,
Mothership. Requesting support.
Copy, Horsemen.
What is the nature of your emergency?
We've been
in a serious accident, Mothership.
We got numerous fatalities for sure.
We need a medevac ASAP.
Copy that, Horsemen.
Dispatching medevac now.
Keep your comms open
while I contact the medevac.
Horsemen, what is
the condition of the payload?
The payload.
Uh…
Yeah, payload is compromised.
Looks like it's busted open
in the middle of the highway.
Stand by, Horsemen.
All right, listen carefully.
Gather whoever can walk or move
and get away from the payload immediately.
Wait, what are you telling me to do?
Shut the fuck up and listen to me.
Get your men out of there, Horsemen.
If they can't move, leave them.
You understand?
Get away
from that location now! Do you copy?
Yeah, yeah, I copy.
Hey! Hey!
Leave it.
Do what?
- They said to stay away from it.
- What?
They said stay…
Hey, we gotta go.
You heard what they said.
We need to move now!
We need to go back. They need our help!
No. There is no "they." You understand?
Everyone's fucked. Come on.
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!
No, no, no. We can't stop.
We got to keep moving.
We're far enough away now. It's okay.
It is so not okay.
All right, all right.
What was that?
It's hunting us.
It's getting further away. Let's go.
- Holy shit. Are you kidding me?
- That really scared me.
Are ya ready, boys?

Thousands of protesters
marched on the Capitol this morning
in response to yesterday's
historic Congressional vote
that narrowly ratified
the controversial proposal
to wipe out the last remains
of the so-called Zombie Wars,
which drew to a dramatic end
with the US military
suffering massive casualties
and being forced to retreat
as Vegas was walled off with the zombies
left inside to haunt the abandoned city.
This will mark the culmination
of the president's efforts
to fulfill his campaign promise
to exterminate
Las Vegas' undead population
by taking the extreme action of dropping
a low-yield tactical nuclear bomb
on the city of Las Vegas
in four days' time,
coinciding with sunset
on the Fourth of July holiday.
The executive order
has prompted the full evacuation
of the McCarran quarantine camp,
which has long been
the target of civil rights groups
who have argued
that no evidence of infection
has been detected in the camp.
Excuse me.
May I talk to that gentleman, please?
Hey, Scott, you got a visitor.
Mr. Ward.
Hey. You're Bly Tanaka, right?
You want to see me?
It's not every man
who saves the secretary of defense
from a horde of flesh-eating monsters,
earns the Medal of Freedom,
only to end up…
Working at a burger joint.
Mr. Tanaka,
I am well aware of my situation.
Here's the thing.
There's $200 million
in the basement vault beneath the Strip.
Two hundred million the insurance company
already reimbursed me for,
un-taxable, untraceable.
Un-spendable.
That's where you come in.
With 96 hours left,
the government has already moved
more than half of its military presence
out of the quarantine zone,
which makes it vulnerable.
I want you to put together
a team and get it out.
In exchange,
50 million is yours to divvy up
amongst whomever you take in with you.
Intrigued?
Don't give me an answer.
Think on it for the night.
In good faith.
We'll talk soon, Mr. Ward.
You should just be happy
that this is essentially
a government-funded health care solution
that will put an end to all of this.
Come on, Sean.
You know they're not infected.
If they were,
they would be zombies already.
They're political prisoners,
just people the government
doesn't want on the streets.
You know as well as I do, if you have
questionable immigration status,
advocate for gay rights or abortion,
the next thing you know,
they have a temperature gun at your head
or dragging you out
of your house or your car
under the guise of public safety.
We've tested
thousands of nukes in the Nevada desert.
This is no different.
Attention detainees
of Las Vegas McCarran quarantine camp.
This facility is in an active evacuation.
Board the shuttle bus for Barstow.
Have your current
temporary health clearance card
to present to officials
as you board the shuttle.
Reminder, shuttles
will be leaving every 15 minutes.
- Hey, guys.
- Kate!
Hi. I can't breathe.
- You guys excited for the big move?
- Yeah!
Kate, let the kids finish packing.
Go on. Come on.
Kate, I need you to promise me something.
In case anything
happens to me in the next few days,
just make sure
the kids make it out to Barstow. Okay?
What do you mean? What could happen?
You know her, don't you?
The coyote.
Geeta, that is not an option.
Kate,
she helps people get in,
crack a slot machine, slip back out.
Before anyone even knows, you're gone.
That money is our ticket out of here,
or we'll be trapped in Barstow forever.
Listen, these guards,
they don't give a shit.
But for five grand,
I can buy my way out, me and my kids.
I have to get the kids out by Friday,
and I will do
whatever it takes to protect my family.
Geeta, people that go in there,
they don't always come back.
Just forget it.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, Geeta, come on.
- Just let it go, okay?
- Well…
- Hey.
Everything okay here, ladies?
What, you don't have
anything better to do?
Kate…
- The fuck you say to me, volunteer?
- She didn't say anything.
- Is that right, volunteer?
- Kate.
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!
Okay.
What? Were you saying something to me?
Don't.
No, I didn't say anything.
You know, the first sign
of infection is belligerence
and actions outside of social norms.
Look at me and hold still.
Clear.
Volunteers
and temporary workers,
employee shuttles leave in five minutes.
Your turn.
If you want,
I could use my rectal thermometer.
Oh.
You're down a couple of decimal points.
You sure you're feeling all right?
- You sure you're not infected?
- I… I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm… I feel fine.
Well,
you're both within
the margin of error, but watch it.
You better be on that bus, volunteer.
Asshole.
What were you thinking?
Do you know how easy it would be
for him to make you disappear?
All he has to say
is that you dropped a degree,
and nobody would question it, nobody.
- I know, I'm…
- You know?
I just… He…
Look, it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry. I just…
I need you to promise me
that you're not gonna do anything stupid.
Geeta, it's… it's not worth the risk.
No, you're right.
I won't.
I promise. Okay?
Thanks.
…employee shuttles
leave in five minutes.
Mom!
Yes?
Mr. Tanaka, I'm in a tough spot.
I don't like you very much.
So I hate giving you
the satisfaction of taking the job, but…
You'd best to gather your team.
You'll need
a helicopter pilot and a safecracker.
I'm gonna text you an address.
Be there at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.
He's in.
I hate to ask, but…
I have to take the kids to school,
and if I can't get to my job...
Don't worry, I'll fix it.
Thank you, Maria.
Don't worry about it.
Careful, I'm all greasy.
Sharkey, give her the white loaner.
- Gracias, Maria.
- Say hi to the kids.
Okay. Bye.
Fuck.
Hey.
Hey!
So you think it's a bad idea?
Come on, Scotty.
It's not a matter of "think."
It's a matter of "is,"
and it is a bad goddamn idea.
- You're out?
- I didn't say that.
You're in?
I didn't say that either.
But you're intrigued.
That much I'm guessing
your ass knew before you even walked in.
I mean, think about it.
Everything we did,
all those people we saved,
look what it got us.
But what if… what if just once,
we did something just for us?
We could die.
Yeah, we'll probably die.
Hmm.
Some of us at least.
Fifty million dollars.
Fifty million.
What's the split? Even however many ways?
Figured you, me, and Vanderohe will take
15 million each, assuming he'll do it.
Everybody else who isn't family…
Nobody needs to know our cut.
Now you're getting it.
Who else
is on your crazy-ass list?
So I see you had a visitor.
Talk to me. How'd it go?
Well, first time she's come
to visit me in six months.
We can't make small talk
for more than 35 minutes
without it turning into a fight.
Still, she seems happy.
That's what matters, I suppose.
I'm sure that she appreciates you,
even if you don't realize it.
- Mmm.
- I mean it.
And if she doesn't… …screw her.
That's, uh, some heavy shit.
So where's your head at?
You know, when we were in it,
like, when we were really in it,
I never thought about the faces
of all the countless monsters
but now just realized, you know,
were people.
But now their faces,
that's all I see.
I don't know if being back in
would be better or worse.
God, I can't figure that out,
but I guess
there is a chance that it could be…
cathartic.
There it is.
Would you look at that.
They should have
nuked Vegas in the early '90s, but…
- This is great.
- Peters!
Holy shit.
What's up?
What the hell brings you here?
How's the job?
Sucks ass. What're you guys doing here?
- Well...
- We are putting together a crew for a job.
Yeah? What does it pay?
Well, if it pans out,
you make two million dollars
for one day's work.
- Two million dollars?
- But...
That's my share. Just for me?
Two million dollars if it pans out?
Hundred percent. I'm in. Yeah.
You don't want to know the risks or...
Why would I want to know the risks?
Two million dollars? That's a lot of cash.
Listen, I hate my life so deeply,
if I had two million dollars,
my life would change drastically.
Yeah. Thank you. Yes.
You sure you don't want to know?
Uh…
I bet it has something
to do with a helicopter.
Yeah.
- I'm the helicopter guy. Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Where do I sign?
- Okay.
- I'm in.
- Thanks. Nice seeing you, bud.
She hasn't changed, has she?
Nope. Still weird as ever.
Come on. This next one's on me.
Come on. Shit.
That's it, baby.
That's what I'm fuckin' talking about!
Mikey Guzman.
- Mikey Guzman. Name rings a bell.
- Mm-hmm.
Check this out.
This is your boy, Mikey Guzman,
taping live from East Las Vegas.
We got a group of…
I counted at least five,
but let me double-check. Hold on.
Seven. We got seven shamblers.
Boom, motherfucker! Double headshot.
- Shit!
- Kid's crazy.
There are Reddit forums
devoted to this guy.
Swagger, baby!
- Swagger, man. Hell, yeah.
- That's how it's done.
Thank you very much.
@GuzmanOfTheDead420.
Make sure to like and subscribe.
Yo, that motherfucker has a Rolex.
That's ten grand at least.
Hey!
Qué onda, güero?
Mikey Guzman.
Yo, what's up?
What would you say about making 500 grand?
I'd say, "Who the hell do I gotta kill?"
I love him.
What are we doing here?
You told me you needed a safecracker.
Might be your missing piece.
How would you like to make
250 grand for one day's work?
Oh, my God.
Can you crack it?
- Can I crack it?
- Yeah.
Can I crack it?
This is like showing me a picture
of Botticelli's Madonna of the Magnificat
and asking me if I want to fuck her.
Okay, the man who designed
this wonderful work of art,
Hans Wagner,
he named it Der Götterdämmerung
for the final chapter in his namesake,
Richard Wagner's epic opera,
Der Ring des Nibelungen.
- Mmm.
- Can it be opened and by me?
I don't know.
- I honestly don't.
- Okay.
Watch your fingers, Mr. Big Hand.
But of the world's living locksmiths,
do I represent
your greatest chance of opening it?
I can, with humility, say yes.
You're in?
It's a doorway
to another realm, my friends,
and providence has brought you to me.
We go through it together.
- By the way, what's your name?
- Scott Ward.
- Sorry?
- Scott Ward.

- Okay.
- How's it going?
- Welcome to the team.
Scott, you want to tell me
what's up with the kid?
Look at him. No offense,
but he doesn't look
like zombie killer material.
Hi, my name is Dieter, and I'm going
to open what cannot be opened.
Are you kidding me?
No, we need the kid
to open the safe.
We lose him, we got nothing.
Let's go, guys. Bring it in.
Mr. Tanaka, team's all here.
Lovely to have you
all gathered here today.
Meet your target.
The Vegas Bly.
You can't fly into Vegas.
It's restricted airspace.
But you can fly out.
There is an abandoned rescue helicopter
on top of the north tower, Sodom.
If you coordinate and communicate,
this should be a simple in-and-out.
You will enter the city
with a 32-hour window.
Whatever zombies are still walking
should be no problem for a gang
of tough hombres such as yourselves.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
My apologies.
How precisely do we do the zombie killing?
Oh, Jesus.
Is there anybody else here
who hasn't killed a zombie?
Well, we all know the basics.
Zombies, shamblers, the undead,
whatever you wanna call them,
when it comes to killing them,
it's all about the brain.
Brain.
One comes at you, shoot it in the brain.
It's that simple. Any questions?
Yes. What if I took a big rock
and smashed it into the head?
Would… would that work?
Yeah. Yeah, that, uh…
that also would still be targeting
the brain, so that would work.
Copy that.
Sorry, Mr. Tanaka, please continue.
From there,
you move down the Strip.
You'll reach the casino
in less than two hours.
You go in and find the generator.
The safe,
beneath the south tower, Gomorrah…
is at the end of a hallway.
There, you'll find
several nonlethal deterrents.
You'll have to find a way to trigger them.
Meanwhile,
our fearless pilot-slash-mechanic
fuels the helicopter.
Back at the main door,
our safecracker gets to work.
Like a surgeon or a painter,
his masterpiece rendered
in barely audible clicks.
Finally, she succumbs
to the sheer dominance
of his gentle touch.
Then, all you have to do
is load the money on the helicopter
and fly off into the sunset.
All this…
…a full day before the nuke
ever leaves the launchpad.
Easy peasy Japanese-y.
Sorry, sir.
We're not allowed to say that anymore.
It's "lemon squeezy" now.
Yeah, but I'm...
I think it's fine if he's Japanese-y.
As you wish.
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
Take a look.
Oh. Okay. Good job. Good job.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
This is the real plan? It's zombies?
Yeah, bro, what's going on?
I thought you were cool with it.
You were always talking about how, if you
saw a zombie, you'd fuck his shit up.
That was bullshit, man.
What?
Fuck this. I'm out.
This is crazy. You all are gonna die.
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry, brother.
Amateurs.
Hey, Damon. Wait, man.
All right, team,
grab your load-out bags.
See you at 6:00 a.m. sharp.
Roger that, Cap.
Now, hold up, hold up.
My name's Martin.
I'm Mr. Tanaka's head of security.
Anything you need, you talk to me.
I can access any hardware you might want.
I'll also be accompanying you on this job
because of my
extensive knowledge of the casino.
Any questions?
Good. See you at 0600.
0600?
How're you feeling?
You're insane.
You know that, right?
But if it's a choice
between dying on the Strip
and spending another day
flipping patties at the Lucky Boy,
I'll gamble on a few million.
Have you given
any thought to how you'll get in?
Yeah.
Recent arrivals
require a full health inspection.
Barstow Quarantine Center
is a zero-tolerance facility.
Without a green health clearance sticker
on your key card,
you will not be permitted in common areas.
Hey. Kate.
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
- No. No!
- Wait. Whoa!
Just hear me out. Hear me out.
I have an opportunity,
and I need your help.
Look. I know this is gonna sound crazy.
But do one thing for me.
For you?
Do this one thing,
and I can give you $15 million.
- Fifteen million?
- Fifteen…
You don't have $15 million.
If you do this one thing for me, I will.
I know this
is not gonna make up for what I did…
…or what type of father I was.
Yeah.
With $15 million,
you can help these people.
You can go back to school,
do whatever you want.
Whatever you do with this money,
I know will be the right thing.
What one thing?
Hey. Please! Hey. Hey.
You're the coyote, right?
Take us in. Please.
Please.
Not bad for your first time.
Okay, I get it. I understand.
I understand
what beautiful little machine.
Hey, don't point a gun at me.
Sorry. Sorry.
Whoo!
Here comes our ride.
- Oh, good. You want some water?
- Yeah.
You're kidding. What is this?
What?
I swear to God, if this whole mission
is some insane way
for you to reconnect with your daughter...
It's not, all right? Trust me.
She's a volunteer at the camp.
She's got connections.
She's just giving us a ride
into the quarantine zone.
You really think
I'd take her inside the city?

Criminals, meet your coyote.

Lilly, but "coyote" sounds cool.
You can just call me that if you want.
All right, I'll leave you guys to it.
I'll meet you outside Barstow in 24 hours.

Try not to get nuked

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's wrong?
Mom's gone.
- Here.
- Um…
Question.
Yes, Dieter.
You don't think I need something bigger?
If I give you something bigger than that,
you're already dead.
Dead?
Auf Wiedersehen, dead.
Um, this belongs to where?
Give me a fucking break. Really?
Dieter, try not to piss Van off.
Thank you, sir.
Hey.
- What did you do?
- What do you mean?
Stop!
Get off me!
- Stop!
- What the hell's going on?
The hell are you doing?
You took her in.
You took in Geeta.
Yeah. I took her in. Her and two others.
I take a lot of people in.
They need that money to get out of here.
- You know that.
- She didn't come back.
Well, not everyone does.
- They know the risks.
- She has two kids!
She didn't tell me that.
Listen, if I knew she had kids,
I wouldn't have taken her.
Did you see her die?
No.
They went ahead. I… I hung back.
They never came out. I'm sorry.
I waited, Kate, as long as I could,
but at the end of the day...
I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
We're not having this conversation.
You're not coming.
There are two kids
whose mother is lost in there.
Two kids that I help look out for.
I have to find her.
Well, tell us what she looks like.
We'll look out for her.
- You think I trust you to do that?
- Kate!
- You're not coming!
- I'm not asking you!
I'm telling you what's gonna happen.
Come here.
Listen to me. As someone
who's seen what this looks like,
this is not a path you wanna go down.
I'm not gonna let you try.
You're gonna stay put.
We'll look for your friend.
I'll see you when we get out.
- Okay?
- No. No, not okay.
You listen.
I'm going in either way.
I can go in with you,
and you can keep me safe.
- Kate.
- Or... Or… I'll just sneak in after you,
and I'll probably die.
The choice is yours.
What's it gonna be, Dad?
If we see your friend, great.
But you are not to run off
looking for her. This is life or death.
And if you screw around,
some of these people are gonna die.
You understand that?
And they've got families too.
So you are never, ever to leave my sight.
Those are my terms. Are we clear?
Yeah. We're clear.
Guys, this is Kate,
newest member of the team.
- Hey. Hello.
- How's it going?
Scott, what the fuck?
You having a good time?
What's he talking about?
The bomb that's coming to kill you?
Is that what you're talking about?
That's the last bus.
Go, Speedy Gonzales! Arriba.
This is
a mandatory evacuation zone.
- We're going to need one more guy.
- For what?
You don't know what it's like
in there. Not anymore.
- The team's big enough...
- Trust me. We need another person.
What the hell's going on here?
You want to make 20 grand?
Twenty thousand dollars?
Yeah, I'll make 20 fucking grand.
I don't fucking get it.
Why the fuck would she bring him?
Honey, easy with the f-bombs, okay?
- Are you kidding?
- Chainsaw.
We're about to march into a sea
of dead people and commit grand larceny.
- But excuse me for swearing.
- That's for you.
Me? Oh, yes.
I got this.
Whoo!
We're gonna have some fun, yeah?
I'm telling you,
you got the right guy for this.
And also, if you happen
to get scared in there or nervous,
I want you to stay close to me.
- Mm-hmm.
- I got you.
Thanks.
What's up, bro?
Gas tank. You carry that.
Don't ever touch my saw again, okay?
Don't ever talk to her again…
bro.
- Okay. For sure.
- Good answer.
All right, guys, let's go!
The fuck you looking at?
Behind me.
Put your gun up, idiot.
Hey. It's not too late to go back.
There they are, the shamblers,
what's left of them.
What happened to them exactly?
What's it look like?
Weren't smart enough
to get out of the sun.
You should see what happens when it rains.
For a few hours,
they all come back to life.
Oh, Scheisse!
Okay, let's go. Come on.
How… how much rain is…
Let's get this.
Tourists.
Hey, you're Lilly, right?
You sure know your way around here.
Well, what's it to you?
Well, maybe a lot.
How much you know
about how these things operate?
Everything there is.
- Hmm.
- Why?
Good to know.
Wow, was ist das?
Holy shit. What is all this?
What happened here?
Where the police
and military finally fell.
Vegas' last stand.
Whoa, whoa. Everybody be quiet.
Do you hear that?
- What the hell is that?
- Get behind the car! Go!
What is this?
Valentine.
Valentine?
It's a goddamn zombie tiger.
That's crossing the line.
- Hell, yeah.
- Awesome.
Clear.
- Los geht's.
- Okay.
The hell was that?
She was one of Siegfried and Roy's.
She guards
the beginning of their territory.
- Is there another way around?
- Not really.
Hey, Cummings.
Let me see your gun for a second.
What? No shot.
Just for a second.
I like it. It's beautiful.
It's reliable too.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Can I touch it?
- You wanna touch it?
- Yeah.
Just for a second.
Just for a second.
Mmm.
- Oh, my…
- Hey!
I would say I was hoping I wouldn't
have to do that, but I'd be lying.
- What are you talking about?
- What is she doing?
She just shot me. Shoot her!
They'll know we're here. They won't care
so long as we play by their rules.
- Rules? De qué habla esta pendeja?
- O sea, estáloca.
If we wanna go further,
we have to make a trade.
- Trade? Really?
- No trade!
Yes. An offering to show our subservience.
- They don't think.
- Shoot this bitch!
- If they come, we kill them.
- You don't understand.
- They're not what you think they are.
- Shoot her in the face!
We're not talking about shamblers here.
You're right. They don't think.
They just move and eat.
But we're talking about the other ones.
- The alphas.
- Yes. They're smarter. They're faster.
They're organized.
Straight out of your fucking nightmares.
Please.
You all keep talking
about the city like it's their prison.
It's not. It's their kingdom.
They won't mind us
poking around the outside
so long as we play by their rules.
- Oh my God!
- We're moving into the heart of it now.
I have a mother. I love her.
Well, everyone has a mom, you cunt,
but not everyone is an abuser
lording power over quarantined women.
She's lying!
That's not true.
Shut your mouth.
I've seen what you've done to those women.
You fucking rapist.
Oh my God!
That's not true at all.
- Oh, fuck, no! No!
- She's coming.
Who's coming? What's coming?
- She? What's she?
- No, please. We bonded. Please.
No. No, no, no. Don't trust her.
- Sorry.
- No, please.
Help me. Don't go. No, we're a team.
What the…
What… what the fuck?
Scheisse.
Help. Shoot this!
What the fuck is this thing?
Listen, no. No. Hi.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Come on.
Help me, help me, help me, help me.
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Help me!
Don't do it. Just stay away.
What are you doing?
No. Oh my God!
Go away. Go over there. Go over there.
No!
Help! No!
- You ever seen her kill anyone?
- Couple times.
No!
Did they come back?
Yep, as shamblers.
No!
My theory, this started
with one of them, an original.
Oh, my God! No!
Whoever that is, if he bites you...
- Then you become an alpha.
- Exactly.
Looks like
they're taking him to the Olympus.
Good. Now we know where not to go.
I've never figured out
exactly how it works.
All I know is they take you in there,
and you come out like one of them,
one of the fast ones.
- So, they're taking him there to turn him.
- Yes.
Scott, that could be where Geeta is.
Kate, we've already talked about this.
- We have time.
- It's not an option.
Fine.
That's what I thought.
So, the shithead
buys us passage, and we keep going?
Well, yeah.
The shithead should buy us some goodwill,
but I'm not about to flaunt it
by walking on their streets.
If we want to go further, we go indoors.
Allez, let's go.
Hey, uh, has there been
any thought given to triage?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, obviously,
the German is the most important person
'cause he can open the safe,
but barring that,
it's got to be me, right?
Because without me,
you can't fly the chopper out of here.
So that would make me
second most important.
And I don't know if you two
are tied for third or whatever,
but I'm certainly
more important than that guy.
Sorry. I didn't know
you were listening. I am way…
Okay, I am definitely
more important than that guy.
I don't trust that guy.
You know why he was hired?
He was hired to keep tabs on us
for when we open the safe,
that we didn't take the money and run.
We should be incentivized.
I'm not trying to be the bad guy,
but we should be incentivized
to let him die.
What? What's everybody looking at me for?
It's a free country.
People can look at whoever they want.
Actually, it's not a free country.
We're not in America anymore.
Haven't you heard?
Which technically makes it
an even freer country, right?
Whatever.
What the fuck is this?
Stay away from me!
What the fuck?
What is that?
No.
Hey.
Hey. Let me talk to you for a second.
I can help you. Just let me...
Okay. Okay.
What the fuck?
No.
No.
No. No, no!
Okay. Okay, look.
Let's just talk turkey for a second. I...
Oh, shit.
Don't touch them.
Don't shine the light in their eyes.
I've seen this before.
They're hibernating.
If we can't see them,
how are we supposed to move forward?
I'll mark us a path.
Go for it.
Why? You want to check out my ass?
No. I don't trust you
to have our backs if shit goes bad.
I've been watching you,
and you're up to something.
When we all get to the casino,
I think we need
to have a little conversation
about what exactly your role is here.
Knock yourself out.
Gotcha, bitch.
You motherfucker.
Bitch.
Fuck!
This way!
- Where's Chambers?
- She was right behind me.
- What happened? What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
She started shooting.
I wasn't close to her.
Bullshit! She was back there
with you! I know she was!
- Buddy…
- What happened?
- You don't want to...
- Motherfucker!
She's gone! Come on.
Leave her! She's dead!
Chambers! Chambers!
Come on!
Go!
Run! Run!
Guz, come on. Let's go.
Guzman. Guz! She's gone.
We gotta move. Come on, move!
Lilly.
There's no way Geeta's alive, right?
I mean, look at these things.
Don't be so sure. I brought a guy in once.
Lost sight of him.
Had to leave him. I thought he was dead.
Then three days later,
he came walking back out.
What happened to him?
Said they took him to the Olympus.
Shoved him in a room
with two other people.
The leader, he came for them one by one.
If my guy hadn't escaped,
he would have been next.
So that's a pretty common theme for you?
Leaving people behind.
Do you think
I enjoy having to leave people?
I'm doing what I can to make things right.
Sir.
Come here. Look at this.
The hell?
Is that…
Yeah, another set
of blueprints to the safe.
Another set of blueprints.
Slimy bastard, Tanaka.
Tanaka had other teams here before us.
Do you know anything about this?
That's news to me.
Peters, get up to the roof.
Get that chopper running
as fast as possible. Cruz, go with her.
She talks too much.
Look, I'm excited
to see my friends again, okay?
Sue me.
Me and the coyote will do
a perimeter check, board up the doors.
Yeah. Kate and I
are gonna find the generators.
Backup gennie's on the third-floor roof.
That's gonna be your safer bet.
Third-floor roof. Got it.
Van, get Dieter down to the vault.
Take Guzman with you.
Roger that.
Dieter, access card for the outer doors
to the safe and the service elevators.
It's by the cashiers windows that way.
This should get you inside. Here.
Thank you.
That one's mine.
I got another one.
All right. Everybody knows
what they're doing. Let's get it done.
Yes, sir.
What a hunk of junk.
No la vayas a cagar, my friend.
Right.
Bye.
What the hell is this?
Spend all his money
on that fucking miniature?
I really hate that tiger.
It's perverse.
What was it?
Guilt finally get the better of you?
One too many out there to die?
Matter of fact, yes, it has.
That mom Kate's looking for,
did you shoot her in the leg too?
No, I just lost her.
I've never left anyone I didn't have to
or who didn't deserve it.
You have no idea
what I've seen in those camps.
What those people have to do to survive.
At least within these walls,
the rules are clear.
You don't see them
fucking each other over.
If you screw me…
two between the eyes.
Two? Why two?
The second one's just for fun.
Ah! Shit.
What happens now?
We wait.
You understand
that I had to do it, right?
Do what?
Put her down.
You know, all those things
they were saying… about me after.
- I want to make sure you know I loved her.
- Yeah.
We loved each other.
If I ever made it seem
like that wasn't the case, I'm sorry.
I got it. It's okay.
- You do?
- Yes.
You did what you had to do.
She was one of them. It…
It's fine. Okay?
Wait.
You think that's why I haven't
been talking to you all these years?
Well, it seemed like the…
- Seemed like the logical assumption. Yeah.
- No.
What you did and what happened to her,
I never blamed you for that, ever.
Well, I don't… I don't get it.
If it wasn't what happened,
what the hell was it?
It's not the…
It's not the fact that…
you killed my mother.
It's that you never showed up after, okay?
You…
You weren't there, Scott.
You didn't call. You didn't visit.
You didn't… talk about it.
You didn't comfort me.
Yeah, you're right.
It's 'cause every time I looked at you,
I just saw her and…
It hurt like hell.
Hurt like hell.
And then when I tried
to come back around, you just…
You seemed like you didn't want me there,
so I assumed I should stay gone.
You know, maybe
there's a chance we could still…
Still what?
I don't know.
Maybe you could look
into college somewhere.
We shouldn't need money.
I could open a restaurant.
A new food truck.
Just have a life.
I was thinking, uh…
I was thinking
artisan grilled cheese sandwiches.
Artisan grilled cheese?
Yeah, what do you think?
Mmm.
Yeah, uh…
I don't know.
It's a… it's a nice idea, but…
I've spent so long hating you
that I can't just turn that off.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- That came out meaner than I meant it to.
- No, it's all right.
No, I understand.
Let's just get this done.

I got the bride. I got the bride.
I shot her three times.
Actually, it was four.
Four.
Whoo-hoo!
Not zombie-killing material,
my ass, Mr. Vanderohe.
Whoo-hoo! Ha!
Sorry, sir. Um… All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Götterdämmerung.
You've been here
in the dark waiting for me.
You're so beautiful. See?
Oh, look.
There's another team of grave robbers.
They tried to cut their way in.
That's so stupid.
You stupid poor skeletons.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no. All they managed to do
is to screw up the card reader.
Is it another team,
or is it us, Dieter?
- Huh?
- Think about it. Us.
I mean, look at them. It's us.
It could be us in another timeline,
and we're caught
in some infinite loop
of fighting and dying,
fighting and dying,
fighting and dying. And Tanaka…
the puppet master.
Devil. God.
And we, you, me, Guz,
and the rest of the team,
simply pawns in some perverse play
where we're destined
to repeat our failures.
And finally,
in some mind-bending, ironic reveal…
it all begins again.
Cool.
Boom.
Amazing.
There.
That's where
the first pressure trigger is.
It's some kind of a booby trap, trust me.
If we could find something to trigger it…
- There.
- I see.
By the way, I love your hair.
Thanks.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
No!
Oh, God.
Hey, sweetheart.
Gotcha.
Get off me!
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Hey, gorgeous.
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay. Oh.
Easy, easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey.
Okay. Yeah.
No. No.
No!
What are you doing?
You said
you just needed a vial of her blood.
Well, forget blood.
You know how much the whole head of
one of these things is worth to my boss,
to the government?
Mwah!
In the right hands,
this is the power to make more of them.
The power to control your own zombie army.
That's the ultimate WMD.
This isn't what we agreed to.
Well, you want your deal or not?
Huh?
That's what I thought.
So you keep your goddamn mouth shut.
Okay, we need to go.
Why? They gonna come looking
for her if she doesn't radio back to base?
Her death cry. They'll have heard it.
Once they find her body, our trade is off.
What are they gonna do?
I don't know.
Now we're talking.
Off you go.
Come on, go get it. That's right.
Come on, fool.
I… I'm okay.
Everything's fine.
Where you getting all these?
Who's got the hot hand?
All right, here we go. You can taste it.
Huh? Huh?
Okay, let's go get it.
Watch this, Guz.
You see that, Diet?
- It's not the meat, it's the heat.
- Okay.
And the deterrent should be releasing
right… now.
What, that's it?
Oh, wow. That's so scary.
Oh, Scheisse!
Fuck.
That was supposed to be nonlethal.
- That has to be illegal, right?
- Good old Tanaka.
Guess he wasn't screwing around.
So is that it, Dieter, huh?
Is it safe now?
I think, probably.
Okay.
Now, it's probably clear.
Good luck with that.
Oh, come on, Guz. It was just getting fun.
Yes.
Yes! Yes!
Come on! Come on!
Yes! Yes!
You filthy piece of shit.
Fuck!
Oh, um…
You okay there, Dieter?
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?
Um, um…
Can you help me, Mr. Vanderohe?
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Thank you.
One, two, three.
If I can open it,
it will be either destruction or renewal.
Death… or rebirth.
That's heavy, brother. But I dig it.
The decision came down to the wire,
but ultimately, the president caved
to the pressures to move the date
of the bombing off of the holiday.
This marked a reversal
of his earlier position
that dropping the nuke
on the Fourth would be, quote,
"Really cool
and the ultimate fireworks show,"
and quote, "Actually kind
of patriotic if you think about it."
Due to fears that
mounting anger from humanitarian groups
would cause the bombing
to be postponed indefinitely,
the administration
has made the dramatic choice
to not postpone the bombing
but rather to move it up
by a full 24 hours.
The fuck?
The scheduled drop time
now coming at sunset tonight.
- Stay with us…
- Mother of God.
Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
Keep checking back
with us here.
- In related news…
- It's insane.
…the International Society
of Elvis Impersonators…
Think that kid
has that safe open yet?
Better get out of here.
Peters.
Yeah.
We got a problem.
They moved the bomb up.
Oh, nice. I'm glad they decided
to move the nuclear bomb up.
I was getting kind of antsy.
We've got about 90 minutes
before this place is dust.
How's it going up there?
Good. I actually found a pool.
Been working on my tan.
Gotta even this shit out.
You know what I'm talking about?
How's it going over there?
Get the safe open yet?
It's a little slower than we thought,
but… we're close.
All right. I'm just giving it
a wash and wax, so hurry up.
Just waiting on you, man.
All set.
Son of a bitch.
- Hey, Dieter. How's that safe coming?
- Scheisse!
Scott, he's working, man.
You see this? The four locks?
You know what that is?
- No.
- No, of course not.
It's a rotating randomization mechanism,
right, Mr. Vanderohe?
- Affirmative.
- Yeah.
You, Mr. Sausagefinger…
You just made me mess up,
and now we're back to ground zero.
If you mess it up again, it locks forever.
You understand? Forever.
Okay, how long
will it take you to open it?
Okay.
- Thirty minutes.
- Okay.
Thirty minutes of silence.
- You got it.
- Silencio.
Of silence. Okay?
Mr. Vanderohe,
can you please keep your team quiet?
I need to concentrate. Thank you.
Thirty minutes, that's not bad. Right?
Nuclear bomb drops on us
in an hour and 20 minutes.
Right, which gives us an hour to get
to the helicopter and get out of here.
- That's plenty of time.
- Plenty.
What's the alternative?
Run for the edge of the city?
I don't think we'll make it.
No, we don't need an alt. We trust him.
- Yeah.
- He can do it.
Definitely.
Right, Van?
Yeah, no, no, no. He's got it.
- Our guy Dieter can do it.
- Ah, fuck.
Must be the fire egress.
Yeah, I got it.
It's probably how the last team got in
and how those shamblers got down here.
Hey, what do you think about tofu?
What?
Tofu. My next food truck.
I was thinking,
can make anything out of tofu.
Tofu burgers, tofu fries,
tofu milkshake, tofu cheesecake.
I don't know what that is.
Tofu cheesecake. I don't know.
I thought maybe, since
everyone's going vegan now, you know.
Humans are figuring out
they're not at the top of the food chain.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's… it's okay.
- Yeah.
- Keep thinking.
- All good up there?
- Uh, yeah. We're secure.
Shit.
How much we got in the cart?
I'd say 200 grand, easy.
- Imagine what's in the safe.
- Check this out.
That is the most money
I've ever held in my hand.
As soon as that door opens,
it's a rounding error,
toilet paper.
I'll take it if you don't want it.
No, that's cool. I got it.
- Are you sure?
- I got it.
Oh, my God.
Guys, I've…
I've done it. I've done it.
Wait, what?
You did it? Like… like, "did it" did it?
He did it.
The only thing
that's left is to turn the wheel.
As it was inevitable that we won.
Mr. Vanderohe, would you do me the honor?
All right, come on. Let's go, guys.
We got about 20 minutes
before this place is dust.
- Let's pack this shit up and go.
- Yeah.
Hey, Vanny,
where's your head at now, bud?
It's in a good place, Scott.
It's in a good fucking place.
Mr. Vanderohe.
Let's go, Guz. Let's get it.
Just like old times, right?
Well, not just like old times
but just as crazy.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know, Scott.
Hey, you can talk to me. What's up?
- You think so?
- Yeah.
You're really stupid. You know that?
Did I miss something?
'Cause we're richer...
I didn't come here
for the money, dumb shit.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'll take the millions.
But… I came here for you.
I thought we could have had something,
but then you just… went away.
It's just that seeing you again
is just… bringing it all back.
- And it's not that I've been waiting.
- You know, I… I haven't.
I'm happy.
Well, I'm… I'm fine.
I just thought that… maybe…
I thought I'd fucked that up… forever.
Forever is a long time.
I'm realizing
that I've been wrong about everything.
About you and me, me and Kate.
Have you seen Kate?
Kate?
- Hey, is Kate down there?
- Not here!
- Kate!
- Where the hell is she?
Kate?
Kate!
Goddamn it! I know where she went.
Scott, listen to me.
Let's think this through.
- Wait for the rest...
- There's nothing to think about.
I know where she went.
She's my daughter. I'll get her back.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
I'm not gonna let you go out there alone.
Thank you.
This way out!
Let's go.
Let's go!
What do you think?
The money.
The money. Okay.
Guzman, cover this corner.
Fuck!
Come on, Dieter! Come on!
No, no, no!
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Whoo!
Martin, let us out of here.
Oh, my God, I got you twice.
I got you twice.
Slow learner.
Tanaka doesn't
give a shit about the money.
What's in this bag
is worth ten times what's in that vault.
Okay, I'm gonna go kill
that dumbass pilot,
now that she's
fixed the chopper, fly myself out of here.
Au revoir.
- Moron.
- Let us out of here!
Fuck.
No!
Fire in the hole!
Hey, baby.
You still with me?
Come on, now.
Damn it!
Three.
All right. We'll make a run
for that elevator. Get up to the roof.
Don't stop for anything.
Go!
Fuck!
Come on!
Let's go!
♪ Do you really want to hurt me? ♪
♪ Do you really want to make me cry? ♪
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Come on.
Peters! What the hell?
Give me 30 seconds.
What the hell is that?
The head of his queen.
Martin said he'd let everyone
out of the camps if I helped him.
If I didn't say anything.
Liar!
Goddamn it! Come on!
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
I know what I'm doing. Just go!
I'll hold him.
Go! Now!
Go!
That's right, motherfucker.
One more step, and I'll blow her head off.
Well, more off.
What are we doing?
Just go!
Let's go!
Goddamn it.
Scott, was that
a zombie in a goddamn cape?
Just fly.
Where's the money?
There is no money.
But, Peters,
Kate's at the Olympus.
We got to go get her.
How much time do we have?
- We got about nine minutes.
- Goddamn it!
You son of a bitch! If we do this…
you better find her, man.
Oh, my God.
- Kate?
- Geeta.
- Kate.
- Geeta, I found you. You're alive.
- Oh, my God, Kate. Oh, Kate.
- Oh, my God.
Kate, you came back for me.
Hey, Peters.
Don't screw me.
Just go!
- Are you bitten?
- No.
- Are you bitten?
- He hasn't gotten to us yet.
Okay, we need to go right now.
Come with me. Come with me.
Okay.
Kate? Kate?
Kate! God.
Fuck!
Sadie!
Kate!
Kate, let's go.
Let's go!
Kate!
Damn.
Kate!
She left us.
Goddamn it. She left us.
Wait, you guys… you guys hear that?
I know, I know. Somewhere between
leaving your ass and saving my own,
I developed a conscience.
It's exhausting.
Get in. Come on, let's go.
- Go, go!
- Holy shit! Hold on!
Hold on!
No!
No!
Dad?
Dad?
Hey. Hey.
Dad, I'm right…
Okay. Okay.
Oh, thank God you're okay.
Hey. Hey, it's not so bad.
It's not so bad.
It's fine. It's not as deep…
You don't have to do that.
Don't do that.
I know what this means.
Don't.
- Hey.
- No.
I've been thinking.
I've been thinking a lot, Kate.
It's got to be lobster rolls.
You know, the food truck.
Yeah.
Scott's lobster rolls.
'Cause everybody loves
a goddamn lobster roll, right?
Yeah.
Everyone loves a goddamn lobster roll.
Hey.
Hey, I got something for you.
Here.
I know it's not millions, but
this should get
Geeta's kids out of the camp for good.
Here. Here, you take that.
You go and make it right.
Okay. Okay.
I'm so goddamn proud of you.
I love you, Kate.
I'm sorry I ran.
I'm such a coward.
You're not a coward.
You're not a coward.
You're the bravest man I know.
I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.
Hey.
- Yeah?
- Let me just look at you.
Dad. Dad.
I'm so sorry.

I would like to rent
that gray and black plane out there.
I'm sorry, sir. Unfortunately,
that's a privately owned aircraft.
I'm not able to just rent you that plane.
Um…
Let me see what I can do.
Enjoy.
Well, that is amazing.
Honestly, how do you ladies make that
in that little kitchen back there?
It's like magic.
Voilà.
We should… we should make a toast.
Oh, we can't. We're working.
No, no. Just one…
One glass, one toast.
It would make one happy man.
It'd mean a lot to me.
- What the hell? Let's do it.
- That's the spirit.
To quote
the great Joseph Campbell, he said,
"It is by going down into the abyss
where we recover the treasures of life.
Where you stumble,
there lies your treasure."
To the ironic twist of the unknown.
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
Mmm.
- That's nice.
- Hmm.
All right. All right.
Let's sit back down there.
There we go. Okay.
Here, take these.
- I'm sorry. I'm a little embarrassed.
- Okay. It's okay, honey.
I'm good. I'm good.
You don't look so good.
- Long day.
- Your skin is really cold.
So, I'm gonna let the captain know.
No. Let me just hit the head
and splash some water on my face.
I'll be good as gold.
- Okay. All right, come on.
- Okay.
- Yep. Let's get up.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Let's get you in.
- It's right here?
- Yep, right there. That's it, right there.
- Yeah, okay.
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine.
- Okay, all right.
Come on.
Ooh.
Good evening,
this is your captain speaking.
We will be beginning
our final descent into Mexico City.
I'd like to ask you to please return
to your seat and fasten your safety belt.
The local time is 9:30 p.m…
…and the temperature is 67 degrees.
Thanks for flying with us.
