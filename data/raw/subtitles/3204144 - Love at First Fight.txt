As I explained on the phone,
our coffins are made in France.
Solid wood, timeless models
and handcrafted finishes.
As for the type of wood,
we have oak, beech and mahogany.
Our selection is available
in 0.7 or 0.85 inch width.
It's important because your father
wanted to be cremated.
The wood you use
doesn't justify your prices.
Your stuff is all recycled.
Ash.
Ash would be nice.
They don't have ash.
Even the oak is Class D.
Look at the knots.
If that's prime cut, I'll be damned.
You're right, it's Class D.
This is disgusting.
Dad would roll over in his grave.

Use your hands!
It took you long enough.
The guy wanted to enlist me.
They must be hard up.
- What did you get?
- A blow-up mattress.
I whipped his ass.
He's 12 years old.
No way, he's at least 14.
Arnaud Labréde!
Oh yeah, we signed you up.
You're kidding me.
Labréde? He's not here?
I'm not fighting a girl.
No one's fighting anyone.
This is self-defense.
Hitting is off-limits
so there's nothing to be afraid oi.
I'm not afraid...
Come on, dude.
Shake hands.
Come on, fight back!
Fight back, it's not over.
What a humiliation, bro!
Bravo, young man.
You okay?
Don't forget your brochure, miss.
You almost ate it.
Did you bite her or what?
No.
I did an armlock.
If that's what girls are like this year,
long live France!
Arnaud?
The door is locked.
I'm taking a bath. What do you want?
It's not easy to talk through a door!
We'll talk later, Morn.
Does the breeze bother you?
I thought you were spending
summer vacation with Xavier and Victor.
But Manu says
you're staying here to work.
Were you planning on telling me?
Of course I was.
I thought I'd help out
and start learning the trade.
In the current context,
it's a serious commitment.
Do you understand?
You think I'm not committed enough?
What I mean is that you're free
to look elsewhere.
Contact other companies or whatever.
The important thing is to plan ahead.
I don't want to plan ahead,
I want to work here.
You see?
He shouldn't leave now anyhow.
Our new catalogue.
We might not be a big company,
but with some good PH
orders will pour in this summer.
Right, Arnaud?
Cool.
Our garden shelters are all unique.
For your home, I would suggest
either the Rochelais or the Panama.
The photos give you a rough idea.
We adapt the structure
to your home,
your desires and your needs.
The important thing is overall harmony.
Madeleine?
Could you come here a second?
Sweetheart,
which one do you like best?
You don't have to buy one.
They're used to rejection.
- Madeleine!
- It's true.
If you want to buy something useless,
don't ask me.
Our products are factory-made
and guaranteed for 5 years.
Cut the salesman crap.
You'd never say: "Our sheds are shit
AND they fall apart!"
Even if they were of gold,
they're dumb.
Are you a landscaping expert?
Tell us which one you like best,
not your life story!
Drop it, Arnaud.
What about that one?
That's the one I like best.
We'll let you think it over.
Maybe it wasn't against you.
Maybe she doesn't like wood.
She did it on purpose.
She made me look like a total moron.
Who gives a shit?
You sold your hut, end of story.
Your thing is beeping.
Shit.
It's fucking infested here.
Catfish eat up all the diversity.
Soon there'll be nothing else left.
Son-of-a-bitch catfish.
Want some help?
You want some help?
I didn't bust it.
Of course you didn't bust it.
It's like if I did this.
You have to visualize your target
as if it were 12 inches behind itself.
You get it?
No.
You have to strike beyond your target.
Beyond your target.
You get it now?
I can't be here
and out there hustling for clients.
Put it down here.
It's gross.
So I thought that...
I'd let you do it yourself.
I'm going to work alone?
It'll be a good experience.
If word gets around,
we'll be overrun with orders.
It's no big deal, you know.
It's like Lego building blocks.
We'll probably need to hire on.
The sky's the limit.
What's she doing with my roof tiles?
She's really nuts.
Yeah, she's kind of weird.
Totally off the hook is more like it-.
Good luck, bro.
Do you have a vegetable garden?
For the earthworms.
Are you spying on me?
You swim weird.
It's not weird, it's the combat swim.
- What?
- Combat swim. Drop it.
I'm sorry I bit you the other day.
If there's anything I can do to make up,
just let me know.
Goddammit!
Are you trying to drown it?
Make yourself at home.
What do you want me to do?
You can adopt it.
Ferrets are easy to tame.
That's a ferret?
A baby ferret.
He'll love you like a morn.
Like a morn?
Animals don't have emotions.
If you die,
your cat will eat your face after 3 days.
We'll turn him loose.
He's too little.
He stinks of chlorine,
his mother would reject him.
He'd die instantly in nature.
I can't keep it.
I'm joining the army in september.
Permanently?
Then I'll keep it.
We're so crashing the party.
No, it's not.
No one told us not to come.
Excuse me,
you know a babe named Violet?
No?
Thanks anyhow.
Saskatoon, in saskatchewan.
What cartoon?
Saskatoon.
I thought you were going to Canada.
That is Canada.
Why the hell are you going there?
It's better than here.
I'm rotting away here.
France is dead.
Get real. There's no future here.
So you're not coming back?
Depends what happens.
At least I'll learn English.
You don't have to go that far.
There must be shitholes in England too.
He's right.
The idea isn't to stay close.
- What is the idea?
- Yeah, what is the idea?
I'll be right back.
Victor doesn't give a shit about us.
We take an interest in his stuff
and he just walks off-.
The two of us by the BBQ... ...
This is a preview of what it'll be like
when he splits.
Oh yeah?
It'll be just the two of us-.
But we'll stick together.
Did you know...
that your cat will eat your face
after 3 days?
Here we go.
This will fall apart in ten years' time.
This is what we need.
You don't give a shit?
Can we get this?
What for?
To make a cage for the ferret.
- Your name, please?
- Labréde. L-A-B-R-E-D-E.
I have a Mr. Eric Labrede registered
for the same company.
That's not us. It was our father.
You want me to transfer
his loyalty points to your account?
What should I do?
What do you say?
What do I do?
How should I know? Arnaud?
I don't know. Take them.
They'll be lost otherwise.
Okay.
It'll pay for your netting.
- We'll take them.
- Okay.
Hey.
How's it going?
Things coming along?
Yeah.
I've almost finished the frame.
You know, pillars like these can support
a very large amount of weight-.
Great.
You know where the soldiers are?
The truck over at the lake is gone.
I know, they left.
They've moved on to the next town.
Never mind.
You want me to take you?
I'll get a helmet.
Fuck!
Don't get all mad.
I want to sign up.
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.
For starters,
take your helmets off.
Arnaud!
I didn't recognize you.
Well?
Has it sunk in yet?
Let's say that, now I can see...
better beyond stuff.
Can't you help her? It's important.
This is fucked.
Army Preparation Camp
1st Parachute Dragoon Regiment
Are you enlisting
or going to summer camp?
For the regiment I want to join,
you have to take a preparation course.
You have to take a course
to join the army?
I thought you just showed up.
It depends on the regiment.
The one I want is super hard.
Super hard, like what?
Super hard,
like you sweat your guts out.
If you want to sleep, you dig a hole.
There's physical combat.
You have to swim
with 60 lbs. On your back.
You ever swim with Rangers?
No.
There's an entrance exam.
You have to eat a raw sardine.
First the head,
then the eyes, entrails and scales.
That's what you want to do?
They have the best survival techniques.
After that, I'll be prepared.
Prepared for what?
To survive.
I got that. But survive what?
How do you know the recruiter?
Maybe I'm interested too.
Oh yeah?
We talked one day.
He showed me some technical stuff.
Like what?
Stuff.
Stop playing Mr. Mystery Man.
You ever heard
oi "double visualization"?
You're going to hit my shoulder.
You need to double visualize
my shoulder 12 inches behind itself.
In other words,
as it there were another me behind me.
You visualize him but you hit...
I think I double visualized you well.
You dislocated my shoulder.
Your turn.
I don't hit girls.
Oh yeah, I forgot. You bite them.
I think it's raining less.
Son of.
Can you explain this shit?
Where were you?
Answer me! Where were you?
You fucked up!
For once I give you some responsibility!
Importation of 23% in volume
and the French only 8%,
a trend that solidifies the colossal
German trade surplus,
which means they sell more
than they buy abroad,
which is the opposite tor the French.
Since 2005, as a matter of fact...
I'm Madeleine Beaulieu.
Your sons are working at my place.
Oh, yes. Good evening.
I brought you a present
to make up for the storm and all.
That's very sweet. Thank you.
Should I take it?
It's baby chicks for the ferret.
- Baby chicks?
- Don't worry, they're dead.
They're frozen. It's more practical.
I got them at a chicken breeding farm.
They sell their losses
to dry dogfood companies.
Powdered baby milk isn't good
for ferrets. They eat meat.
They need solids,
otherwise you change their nature.
That's what dogfood does.
I don't know what to say. Thank you.
It's sweet of you.
Will you stay for dinner?
No, I just came
to give you the present.
I insist. It would make me very happy.
I'll put this in the fridge.
The freezer.
Hey.
Can you imagine a fire in here?
Your mom invited me for dinner.
You don't mind?
No.
You put him in here? Not bad.
You make coffins too?
No, that was for my dad.
They were all ugly
so we said we'd make our own.
But you need a special license.
We didn't have enough time.
Now we don't know what to do with it.
It's not bothering anyone.
No.
Are you in college?
I have a Master's
in economic modeling.
And what's that for?
The idea is to anticipate future events
in order to adapt to them now.
But since future events won't exist,
it's pointless.
I dropped out this year.
I can understand.
Years of college
with no job guarantee...
The recession, unemployment...
It's not easy.
There's far worse in store
than unemployment.
But since we only focus on trivia,
we don't see it coming.
What don't we see coming?
The end.
The end of what?
"The end." Our extinction.
Oh, I see.
What should we look out for?
Take your pick.
Hunger strikes, religious wars,
drought, global warming,
inversion of the poles,
nuclear plants blowing up...
Or epidemics.
That respiratory thing you can't cure.
Coronavirus?
Its prevalence is dropping so...
we watch TV too.
And you like this idea?
Not particularly.
But we're responsible for it all.
Me, in my backyard, I'm responsible
for your end of the world?
What are EU forest industry subsidies?
67.
67%.
For nothing.
We create imbalances everywhere.
And you left college to deal with this?
Makes sense.
I wanted time to prepare.
So what should we do?
Dig holes and bury our provisions
like the Mormons?
- In your opinion?
- You're the expert.
How long will the Mormons hold out?
Three months?
- More.
- Six months?
They'll hold out for one year.
That's a lot of food.
Lots of canned beans.
And what happens after one year?
I'm asking you.
You're back where you started-.
You haven't solved the problem.
Your Mormons will croak.
They'll all kick the bucket.
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- Not at all.
We'll see who's crazy
in ten years' time.
I think it's depressing.
And you, Arnaud?
What?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Kids do feel insecure nowadays.
It's a recession.
Not that.
Her end-of-the-world thing.
If you look around,
things are pretty dismal.
This is cheerful.
The chicken is delicious.
Here.
You should start off with less weight.
Like they say on the website:
I was wondering, are you busy tonight?
I'm going out with the guys
and if you wanted to come...
what for?
I don't know. But since you're leaving
for camp on Monday...
whatever.
Okay, cool.
- You don't want your lemon?
- It's all yours.
- And the mint leaves?
- Go for it.
Where's Xavier?
You want to dance?
The poor things don't even know
why they're here.
They're having fun.
They're dancing and enjoying themselves.
Yeah, sure.
Crowding around under three spotlights
is totally retarded.
They're having fun!
Oh really?
Hey, are you having fun?
You having fun?
There you go. Everyone's fucking bored.
At least they're making an effort.
They have a little respect.
Respect?
Yeah, respect tor the club.
For other people.
You could've made an effort too-.
You could've worn a skin
or put your hair up.
I bet you look good in skirts.
What?
I tried to imagine you
out there dancing in a skirt.
Fuck you too!
- I can be a dance floor slut too.
- Go ahead.
Shit, dude, I'm fucking horny.
A beer?
- How do you do that?
- What?
By hurting myself.
You want to try?
Hold it tight. Bite down.
Pull it back.
Is that your hardest?
Is that your hardest?
You asshole, that hurt.
Knock it off,
you're giving me a headache.
You're not coming?
No, I'm going home.
Bye.
This feels so fucking good!
Just like yo mama!
His girlfriend's not coming in?
I wanted to see her naked!
"Army."- .
"Army."- .
Hello.
I was wondering
whether it's still possible
to sign up for your training camp?
The 1st Parachute Dragoon Regiment.
Remember the army truck at the lake?
Throw me the strap.
They're offering
a free 2-week training course.
The army is hard up.
It's the No. 1 recruiter in France.
Number 2. The first is McDonald's.
I thought about it.
I enrolled.
I won't be able to work with you
over the summer.
You're joking, right?
It's only training camp.
I didn't enlist.
I don't get it.
You got a sudden urge to join the army?
They have over 400 professions.
There's lots of opportunities
for guys like me.
You can get your driver's license
and they even have carpentry.
I don't give a shit if they teach you
how to do macramé.
Two worksites start next week
and this one's late.
It's cool. We're almost done.
No, it's not cool!
How am I supposed to manage alone?
I'm busting my ass to save the company.
I smoke twice as much as Morn!
And you decide to walk out on me?
Are you crazy?
You don't give a shit or what?
Avoid piercing the entrails
or letting the knife slip.
It's a tough task,
especially in this heat...
Is it because I said
you should plan ahead?
Is that it?
I'll be back in two weeks, Mom.
I've been carving up this creature
for over an hour...
You'll keep your hair, won't you?
...and its skin
is already starting to dry up.
The Berbers can use this
as an emergency shelter in sand storms.
Slip inside, fold the top over...
and you're totally protected
from the sand!
Surprise.
What are you doing here?
I'm doing the course, like you.
The recruiter called me back-
He said I should grab the opportunity-.
Did you see that?
It happens all the time in the summer.
We're stopping at every hole in France.
I swear to God.
No one's even getting on.
Yes, there is.
P.D. R?
Yeah.
Is this your first camp?
Not you?
It's my third.
- Did you learn anything useful?
- Yeah.
You learn a lot about yourself
and group management.
Anything technical?
Technical?
With the mountain infantry, we learned
to pee on ourselves in avalanches.
What for?
To find the slope.
Otherwise you don't know.
The way the liquid flows
shows you which way to dig.
That's cool.
I wouldn't have thought of it.
It's a great adventure.
Good evening.
I'm Lieutenant schlieter.
Welcome to the 1st PDR.
As I'm sure you already know,
a fire has broken out in the region.
The regiment was mobilized
to evacuate residential zones.
That's a soldier's duty too!
I'll get straight to the point.
Your rooms aren't ready.
You'll sleep in the gymnasium.
Are there any non-males amongst you?
I'll ask again.
We have no co-ed dormitories.
Are there any girls here?
Yes.
Step forward, young ladies.
I want no
problems...
with sex...
because of you.
Is that clear?
Very well.
You over there. Take your cap off!
- Officer Ruiz, take over.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay.
Men, you head over to the gym.
Follow me, ladies.
I'll show you your rooms.
Give it to me. I'll show you.
They tit together along the grooves.
Okay.
Last year, we did it in the dark.
Now I can do it eyes closed.
Cool.
One, you fit it in.
And two.
Here.
- What field do you want to work in?
- Me?
I'd like to work in telecommunications.
Radio frequencies and technical stuff.
I want to fight.
Oh yeah?
What about you?
I didn't imagine beds like this.
What did you expect?
I thought they'd be old and rotten.
At least they're ugly and they squeak.
- Lights off?
- It's only ten o'clock.
You've got muscle tone.
What do you do?
Macroeconomics. Good night.
Here.
How's it going?
Lift your arm,
index finger facing the horizon.
It's a little trick.
It's not super precise,
but it's better than nothing.
How far is the corn field?
You said to multiply by what?
115 feet.
It's okay.
What do we do now?
Nothing. We go home.
One last example.
This time it's a critical situation-
You need to make a fast decision.
Comeon.
- Create a diversion.
- Not bad.
Forget about diversions. You charge.
"Operation Last Chance."
Like Call of Duty.
No! You have your pals with you.
Your comrades.
So no Kamikaze moves.
You there. What would you do?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Clear out?
Sounds like a good idea.
You disperse.
Now that's interesting.
That's interesting. You do not run!
You re-de-ploy.
We're listening. What next?
That's all.
Each man for himself.
I wasn't thinking of that.
Trainee Peretli.
- We change the rules of the game.
- Why?
- To get the upper hand, sir.
- That's it!
Get the upper hand!
What he just said is very important.
Get the upper hand!
It's the heart of our doctrine-.
If you learn one thing here,
make sure it's that.
Get the upper hand.
15-minute cigarette break.
Excuse me, sir.
How do you concretely
get the upper hand?
Technically speaking.
Did anyone else not understand?
15-minute break.
Beaulieu,
ask someone who was listening.
Imagine that a grenade
lands here in the middle of us.
We're all dead.
But to prevent that from happening,
it only takes one person.
If he covers the grenade with his body,
he absorbs the blast.
The others are saved
and can fight back.
Demonstration.
Good show. We're all dead.
Well done. Bravo.
You're sure it's a fake?
Yes.
Good show, Peretti!
We talked about team spirit.
That can mean sacrifice.
Another problem, Beaulieu?
Yes.
In real lite no one would ever do that.
It's against our basic instincts.
We're not here to let instincts rule.
Here we learn about duty.
It's unenforceable, sir.
End of discussion.
Now for first aid. Who has training?
Good.
The others will do the course
while Labrede cleans the latrines.
That first-aid class was intense.
Beaulieu broke three
of the mannequin's ribs.
You on a diet?
Rustic simplicity my ass!
Is this the paratroopers?
Can you believe it?
You don't want your Jello?
Here.
If you want,
I can show you how to do the massage.
You know,
the first-aid cardiac massage.
You want to show me
how to fold my panties too?
She's hardcore.
What's on the schedule tomorrow?
Swimming with schlieter.
Beaulieu.
Listen to me carefully.
Because I won't repeat it.
I'm the one grading you.
You impress no one
with your big mouth and your degrees.
If you want to be a commando,
you'd better shape up.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good show, men.
Good.
Nice reflex.
I wouldn't have done it.
Come on, push hard.
Comeon.
Don't push off the wall-.
No, I'm good.
Move aside!
That's good.
The strong help the weak.
Your turn, Labréde.
That was good.
Good, Labréde.
Come on, Beaulieu.
Yes! Come on, Beaulieu!
That's ii!
Push! You're almost there!
Man down! Get him out!
Reds! Man down!
What are you talking about?
What's going on?
Nothing. I wasn't hit.
Look at your bag.
What about it?
My bag was hit?
If you're hit, you're eliminated.
Hang on.
What's inside my bag?
My vital organs? My arteries?
Bags?
No one said nothing about our bags.
We're not going to argue.
You're dead.
So you should shut up.
Stop showing off.
Bullets pierce a bag, so lie down!
What's the deal?
You think you're a ballistics expert?
- Stop the bullshit. You were hit.
- I was not!
Then take it off-
show us your back-.
Dream on. Suck off your pal.
I think we should all
return to our initial positions.
Are you her pet dog or what?
I feel sorry for you. Go lie down.
And you, Beaulieu, stop...
How are you?
What happened?
I got a warning.
It'll stay on my record.
Shit.
All because of that prick.
Go on, hold your nose.
The mountain infantry taught him to piss
and he thinks he's hot.
But a little headbutt
sends him running-.
I hate guys like that!
Why is he here, to kiss ass?
Chill, Madeleine.
Want to try the makeup workshop?
Okay.
The idea is to...
break up the shape of the face.
You apply it with two fingers...
in diagonal streaks.
You want to conceal...
the patterns of your nose...
your mouth...
and your eyes.
That way, everything disappears.
- It burns.
- That's normal. Don't touch.
Look.
Very good.
Now it's my turn.
What's that?
Nothing.
They made me unit leader
for the orienteering race.
Close your eyes.
Everyone smile!
The first unit to attain the objective
will have the honor of raising
the regiment's flag on saturday.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good luck, Labréde.
Get the upper hand.
Leduc, are we good?
Yeah, it's over there.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Charlie, Romeo speaking.
State your coordinates.
Lieutenant schliefer?
I can't hear you, Lieutenant.
There is no Lieutenant schlieter!
This is Romeo. Over.
Madeleine, stop it.
Charlie, Romeo speaking.
State your coordinates.
Where are we, Jordan?
We're either here... or here.
But I'd say we're heading...
that way.
That's east. The target is due south.
Jordan's having a hard time.
I think we're totally lost.
Sum up, Samara.
"Lost" is not a coordinate.
The target isn't really south.
Yes, it is. Look, Jordan.
The hill slopes downwards.
That changes the direction.
Are you sure?
Give it here.
- Give the map back!
- One minute.
No, give it back right now!
Let me deal with it.
Listen to me.
What?
Doesn't he have the compass?
I'm sorry! Okay?
You have the compass by the way!
Where are you going?
I have a life to go back to.
Good evening.
Would you like anything?
A beer, please.
We only have alcohol-free.
Maybe with the regional specialties?
An alcohol-free beer is fine.
Everything alright?
It's nothing.
Vigipirate security plan.
Would you like anything?
No.
You insinuating I don't have a life?
I'm not insinuating, I'm saying it:
You have no life.
You don't like people.
You eat things that disgust you.
When you do sports,
you look like you want to die.
You fight to stay in the army
but you hate it.
I'm sorry, life is the opposite
of everything you do.
And building dumb wood huts is life?
It might be dumb but I like doing it.
- You don't like anything.
- It's not true.
- It's not true?
- No.
Tell me one thing you like.
I like lots of things.
For example...
For example, I like dogs.
Dogs?
Like that one?
Exactly.
Hey, doggie.
Don't waste your breath.
Hey, puppy 1109!
Come here, puppy.
You got some extra room?
If you want to go back
with your loser friends, it's time.
Come on, let's go.
What now?
We'll survive. We'll adapt.
That's what you wanted, right?
What do you have on you?
I have a knife. That's all.
I have a flashlight, mess kits
and the camouflage tarpaulin.
We're totally underequipped. Great.
Wait, I have one combat ration left.
Lamb stew.
Toss it. We don't need their stuff.
Lamb stew...
They'll be no help
when everything goes up in flames.
This is a perfect spot.
There's everything we need.
It's great.
What are you doing?
What're you doing?
I'm going to build a shelter.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
It's cool.
It's not finished yet.
I'll put some storage space here.
There's a bookshelf in the back.
Great.
Not bad, huh?
I'll get some moss to insulate the roof.
Don't go that way. I laid traps.
Not that way either.
No?
You should probably go around.
This way?
What next?
Nothing. We just enjoy.
Can't we enjoy and do something?
We shouldn't expend calories.
Why don't you make a fishing line?
Do I have to wait long?
You have to wait.
What's the goal?
The goal is to bury them gently
without breaking them.
What's the point?
Nothing.
You want to try?
What do you think about
while you do it?
Nothing.
I can't do it.
Then you won't survive.
It you cant concentrate
on a pine needle, you can't survive.
Knowing how to pass the time...
not doing or thinking about anything
in particular... that's surviving.
Otherwise you go crazy.
What's going on?
I'm passing the time.
Hang on,
I'll wrap the wire around once more.
You think it'll hold?
Of course it will.
It's a real pro's trap.
Turn it the other way.
Wow, looks like France.
I'm hungry.
You're always hungry.
Did you hear something?
No, it was my stomach.
The wildlife here
is starting to piss me off-.
We still have those weird hazelnuts.
They have zero protein.
We should've taken more snickers
from the army.
Come on, eat! Don't be fussy.
It's disgusting.
Shit, look at this.
I'm sure you can eat the bones.
I bet it's full of good stuff.
I can't eat this.
Don't waste food!
I swear to God, this is horrible.
I'm done.
I'll stick to fishy hazelnuts.
You don't know what you're missing.
I think I'm lying on a rock.
Are we sleeping directly on the ground?
No, not at all.
I made a one-inch mattress of lichen.
It's okay.
It's fine.
Want me to remove the rock?
No, don't worry.
I'll curl up around it.
By the way...
why are you whispering?
I don't want to scare off the game-.
Oh, I see.
Are you okay?
Don't look.
I'll stay over here, okay?
You're shaking. I'll get a jacket.
Madeleine!
Are you okay?
Open your eyes. Keep your eyes open!
Look at me!
Look at me!
She's upstairs.
She hasn't woken up yet, but she's fine.
Thanks.
They can't get the fire under control.
900 hectares have already burnt.
The town they found you in
burned down.
Wiped off the map-.
We were lucky.
How much is 900 hectares?
200,000 trees?
More like 2 million. You hall asleep?
It's a big deal.
It'll affect the price of wood.
We're okay,
I stocked up before. You'll see.
If you want to, that is.
I'm not forcing you.
Can you imagine the waste?
All because some idiot tossed a cigarette.
People don't realize
how fragile forests are.
Sometimes forest fires occur naturally.
The forest just bursts into flames.
- Where did you hear that?
- On TV.
When the forest reaches
its maximum development...
when there's really no more room,
a fire breaks out.
Everything burns.
Afterwards, the forest starts afresh.
Everything starts over.
But most of the time...
it's some idiot who tosses a cigarette.
The other case is rare.
How's the tomato soup?
Wonderful.
You don't hurt anywhere?
Not at all.
Barely 3 on a scale of one to ten.
Did you have to rate your pain?
What did you say?
Four for the head. I had a headache.
Here?
It's funny...
I'd never have thought of rating pain.
Higher UP-
Three's not bad.
It leaves room for improvement.
We can call it a day.
We'll recover slowly.
I'm already feeling better.
Oh yeah?
Of course, I was better trained.
Nice to hear,
next time you'll carry me.
Next time...
it's going to be different.
Next time,
we need to be better prepared.
We will be.
We'll be ready.
That's right.
We won't be caught by surprise.
We won't improvise.
We'll be on the look-out.
On the look-out.
On our guard.
