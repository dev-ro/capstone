IIRIMAA, 1992
Hop on.
Tomorrow is all
muscles will definitely be stiff.
NEW YORK, 2016
A WOMAN'S WORD
I really want...
But you know even...
- You're afraid.
Anyone would be afraid.
Do you really think,
that my word could stop him?
I think this is crucial,
that voters know that,
when it is necessary to decide,
whether this man is fit to be president.
But if he decides
choose the legal route?
Kas New York Times
is ready to help me then?
Media outlets cannot provide
legal support and assistance.
You would be completely alone.
Hello, Rachel.
- And you write about Jessica Leeds?
Jessica is 100% on board with us.
So be it. I agree.
I talk openly about everything,
what he did to me.
Really?
That's very good, Rachel.
Thank you.
Mum has to go to work now.
Stay with dad. Is it OK?
Violet. Violet...
Mum's going to work now. Come.
Let's look at your animals.
- Talia, you're my hero.
Show me your elephant?
Good morning, Jodi.
Are you feeling sick again?
- Yes.
Nausea should be after
after the first trimester.
You should probably get some sleep.
I'm going to bed now,
as soon as I get an answer.
From the Trump people?
What happens if they don't respond?
They answer. But we can't tell the story
until they have responded.
Hello?
- Is this Megan Twohey?
Yes. Mr Trump.
I don't know these women.
They lie.
When I did something to them,
so why did they go to the police
didn't turn to them?
Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks
have not said they know you.
These were occasional meetings.
- This is a New York Times fiction.
When you publish them,
I will take you to court.
How do you comment
the video on "Access Hollywood"?
Do you do such things?
- I don't do anything like that!
I don't do any of that.
It was a guy thing.
Miss Utah claimed you kissed her
forcibly kissed her more than once,
when the contest Miss America
was still yours. - Lies!
You are disgusting!
You are a disgusting human being!
Several women open their mouths,
blaming Donald Trump
inappropriately in the women's test.
Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks
tell the New York Times,
that both of them have Trump on both
groped or kissed each other without their permission.
My God!
Persse. Rachel, I'm so sorry.
I had my story published,
which led to this!
Yes. I am very sorry.
I was ready, but not for this.
An envelope full of shit!
Was there anything written on it?
- No.
What can I do?
I can't even leave the house.
You need to write everything down.
Record your conversations,
everything in your inbox...
Document all threats.
- Megan Twohey? - Yes! Ours.
I can't imagine... Rachel,
I'm very sorry, but I have to go.
I promise to call you back.
Rachel? - Helistan
Fox News's Bill O'Reilly on behalf of.
Are you a feminist?
Are you kidding?!
Please excuse.
Is the latest
effort before Election Day.
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump...
Bill O'Reilly talks about you.
We also invited Ms Twohey to the show,
but he refused.
It's no surprise to us either.
It's a big mouthful.
Her and Mr Barbaro
appeared in programmes,
which represent rather
liberal world views.
We asked Ms Twoheylt,
if she is a feminist.
By phone
or in writing.
He refused to answer.
I'll bring my own noodles.
In an article yesterday he said this...
Our story has many
women's experiences,
going back many years.
Hello?
- I'm stalking you
and then murder you.
Then I'll throw your corpse in the Hudson River.
It's a really exciting evening.
CNN can say that Hillary Clinton
has called Donald Trump,
to admit defeat.
CNN assumes that Donald Trump
will win the election.
FIVE MONTHS LATER
Breaking news about Bill O'Reilly.
Julia Boorstin has the floor.
Just called. Fox just announced,
that Bill O'Reilly is done.
"After a thorough
investigation into the allegations"
"the company and Bill O'Reilly have reached a
an agreement,"
"that Bill O'Reilly will not return
Fox News Channel."
50 "O'Reilly Factor" sponsors
decided to boycott the programme.
Because of the New York Times story that led to the
sexual harassment.
According to the Times, Fox and
O'Reilly about $13 million,
to reach five women
to out-of-court settlements.
Very good work, Emily.
- Thank you, Dean.
Same to you, Mike.
Excellent reflection.
Are we talking about purely legal
abuse of power?
No. We are talking about all jobs,
where sexual harassment is possible.
We are also looking for contributors.
Fox kept O'Reilly on the sidelines after our story.
for quite a long time.
And decades before that.
- It was only then that he got the pen,
when the sponsors disappeared.
- We are looking at the whole system.
Why is sexual harassment
so widespread?
And why is it
so difficult to address?
Hello. Do you have a moment?
- Still.
I spoke to Shaunna Thomas,
who is a feminist group
UltraViolet.
He said that infringements
There's no end to violations in Hollywood.
He communicates with the actor
Rose McGowan,
who have tweeted,
that she was raped by a producer.
According to Thomas, it is about
Harvey Weinstein.
And to McGowan
is currently writing a book about it.
Wasn't it a few years ago
Weinstein was not accused of something?
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez,
Italian model.
He claimed that Weinstein groped the
at a business meeting.
The NYPD investigated the incident, but the man was
no charges were brought against the man.
Talk to Rose McGowan. Search at
other actresses,
with whom Weinstein has worked.
- Yes.
And I try to
I'm also trying to get hold of former employees.
Hello. My name is Jodi Kantor. I am
I'm an investigative reporter for the New York Times.
Let's explore sexual
Harassment in the workplace.
To my knowledge, you worked
1990s Miramax
and Harvey Weinstein?
Are you taping it?
- No. Absolutely not.
And I will not use without your permission
not a single quote.
If you were an assistant,
were you aware of the incidents,
setting Harvey Weinstein
treated women inappropriately?
Or crossed the border?
- Did Harvey cross the line?
Would you like to hear his heartbeat?
- Yes.
Mary, thank you very much,
for calling me back.
Who have you spoken to?
- I can't name names.
In the same way, as I would not give
your name.
If you want to share something with me,
it would be very useful.
I don't think people want
to talk. Please excuse me.
Prl Godr√®che, thank you very much,
for your welcome.
I've talked about Weinstein before,
but not openly.
My immigration lawyer doesn't want to,
me to get involved.
Associate yourself with what?
Hello?
- Hello... Rose...
Here Jodi Kantor
New York Times.
I wrote you an email.
According to Shaunna Thomas, you are ready
to talk to me about,
about Hollywood,
specifically Harvey Weinstein.
Do you write about him?
- Yes.
I tend to think I should not
talk to you about it.
Should I know the reason?
- Your page has repeatedly
treated badly.
And I think the reason is sexism.
I'm sorry,
that you had this experience.
I've opened my mouth before,
but nothing has happened.
I spoke recently
at a policy conference
and the New York Times placed
under the heading "Style".
It hurts when you scream,
but no one listens.
I research systematic
sexism in Hollywood.
How many pages are there together? No.
I have put myself on the line before
and nothing has changed.
I've written for Amazon, Starbucks
and Harvard.
And change came.
The Times article prompted them to
change their rules and internal policies.
But if you don't want to talk,
I understand.
And good luck with the book.
- Thank you.
Sight.
I spoke to Dad.
His condition seemed to have deteriorated.
I have to go see him soon.
Don't want to make a long weekend of it?
You can bring the girls too.
I could take Talia with me,
but not both.
I have a password.
With a very famous actor.
Want his number?
He's so hot.
It looks very beautiful.
You'd really like him.
I am a nasty woman.
Is this Ashley Judd?
- Yes.
He wrote how in the 1990s one
a producer sexually harassed her.
It does not name,
but describes him:
"One of the most admired in our industry/
most reviled bosses."
Shall I go?
- I'll go myself.
Mum!
Let's go together.
- Yes.
I don't know if I can do it.
You need to rest.
Trying to get some sleep?
I don't want...
I feel endless horror.
You're tired.
Your body is exhausted.
I think I could even understand that.
Mum.
Hello?
- Rose here...
McGowan.
- Rose, hi.
You shouldn't just chase him.
Behind it all is a big frame.
A supply chain...
Hollywood abusers?
- Exactly.
They are above the weather.
Wherever films are made or sold.
Each studio shames the victim itself
and pays for everything.
This would be what white men
playground.
Do people know about it?
- Of course.
I spoke to many,
what happened to me.
Sundance Film Festival?
I was 23 years old.
I was making genius independent films.
I was very hopeful.
And then I went into the hotel room.
Talia?
- I'm here!
He sat on the sofa
talking loudly on the phone.
I was waiting. Then we talked about projects.
And suddenly he said:
"There's a hot tub in my room."
I didn't know,
what to say,
so I just kept talking.
We drew a line under the conversation.
He said he would send me out.
I thought it went very well.
It was my first big meeting.
He walked down the corridor after me.
And then he said:
"There's a hot tub in this room."
I looked inside
and he pushed me inside.
He tore my clothes off.
And suddenly he was naked.
Somehow I got out of my body.
And then he raped me.
I switched to survival mode,
in order to escape.
I pretended to have an orgasm.
He told me to get dressed.
He left me messages saying,
that I was his new "special friend".
And that he was for many
actresses.
Have you made a complaint?
Do you see a way in which the law
would be on my side?
But did you tell anyone?
I told many people about it,
but no one did anything about it.
Nothing if anything.
Can I contact people,
you told about this?
You said it would remain private.
His spies are now watching you.
I hope you know this.
Hello?
- Hello, Megan. This is Jodi Kantor.
Is now a bad time to call?
No.
I can hear him.
How's it going?
- Yes...
I just got him to sleep.
This is the hardest part.
- Is it really?
For me it was.
With your first daughter
I had postpartum depression.
Everyone is so excited...
But you would not be there.
Yeah...
I received your email.
How's it all going?
- Yes...
I feel that there are a lot of women who are...
lived through something with him.
But it is difficult for them to talk about it.
And those who talk to me,
don't want to say anything on the record.
In previous stories...
How to persuade women to speak out
about what had happened to them?
Yes... So...
It's complicated. They are afraid.
But I was trying to convey a point.
"I can't talk to you
change what happened,"
"but together we can use
your experience,"
"to protect other people."
I told them the truth.
But yes... It's hard...
Ask women to speak up.
Then he asked me to meet him...
Very early.
I was on location all night,
so I was tired.
I went to a hotel
and asked at reception,
whether Mr Weinstein is in the restaurant
or on the terrace.
I was told to go to her room.
I went upstairs.
And Harvey was wearing a bathrobe.
He asked if he could
give me a massage.
I replied: "No!"
And then he wanted me to help
to help him choose his clothes for the day.
He started asking for such things.
Things became increasingly sexual.
He pushed closer and closer.
I replied
several times in the negative.
And in many different ways.
Finally, he asked me to watch,
how he washed himself.
Then I said, "Harvey,"
"if I win
I win an Oscar with a Miramax film,"
"I'll give you oral sex."
And I quickly ran away.
What did you do?
- I told my dad,
to your agent, to people,
to the people I had to film with that night.
And Harvey punished me.
He destroyed my career,
because I dared to tell him.
- How do you know?
When I stood with other actors,
he ignored me.
There were different roles that strangely
strangely, I missed.
And now I know,
that behind it all was Harvey's calls.
I also wrote an article about it.
And nobody did anything about it.
- You didn't mention his name there.
But do people in the film industry
understood who they were talking about?
Absolutely. And insults
flew in my direction, not his.
You know the demonstration where I presented
my poem "Nasty Woman"?
I lost a big advertising job.
Because a small group of people claimed,
that I was quoting the President.
He used this kind of jargon
and was elected president.
I quoted him...
And I lost my job.
Decades have passed,
but sexism is still rife.
Jodie, if I could,
I would make the same choices again.
But I also want to work.
Advocate Lisa Bloom wrote to me.
Gloria Allred's daughter? - Yes.
- Do you know her? No.
But I assume he wants to help.
I forwarded the email to Emily.
Jodi? Lisa Bloom.
"Big announcement.
My book "Suspicion Nation""
"help to issue
Harvey Weinstein and Jay-Z."
"Weinstein is publishing his book?"
Lisa Bloom, daughter of feminist icon,
collaborates with Harvey Weinstein.
Why would he do such a thing?
- How much for a mini-series?
Weinstein must be behind it,
Lisa contacted you.
So Weinstein knows,
what we do.
Sorry.
Do you want to continue with Trump?
You can also go to Jodi for help,
to investigate Harvey Weinstein.
I am afraid it will make a difference.
People opened
mouths against Trump too,
but he still became president.
- But in the light of the O'Reilly case...
there is an opportunity.
Excuse me. Craig.
I've been trying to get hold of you.
How is your daughter doing?
- Very well.
Sorry. Thanks for the gift.
Is something bothering you?
Apart from not being able to sleep
and nappies everywhere?
Are you OK?
I have a pretty...
complex.
That's sad to hear.
Would working help?
- Yes.
Absolutely. It's better now.
Are they all famous?
The lion's share of them though.
I would just like to know if this is
the best use of our time.
When compared to other people,
who we could reflect.
To help people who are helpless.
Actors already have a voice.
They may fear the wrath of the film industry,
if they use their voice.
Sure, but...
What exactly are we looking at?
Exploring the extreme
sexual harassment in the workplace.
Young women went
went to business meetings of their own accord.
To the producer, to the employer.
They were hopeful.
They were expecting a serious conversation
about their work or a new project.
Instead they were threatened with
and made sexual demands.
They claim,
that they were attacked and raped.
When this can happen
With Hollywood actors,
who else can this happen to?
Do you think that Weinstein
were also targeted?
I think so.
I can investigate police complaints,
that have been made against Miramax.
Or court files.
Should I do it?
- Yes.
I found one complaint
against Miramax from 2001.
But the file was closed
on the same day it was made.
"The plaintiff went to court."
But there is no court record of this.
There is already a contradiction here.
Do you have any more information on this?
No. These entries have already been destroyed.
Really? Why?
- Agency rule.
The covers are destroyed
every three years.
Why?
- As I said... It's a rule.
Could you tell us who submitted
sexual harassment complaint?
No, you can't.
Because...
- It's a rule.
We are banned from
to disclose this name to you.
Is that all?
This is very important.
This concerns someone who is still
still in a very powerful position.
And he can still
harass someone.
Is there anything you can do to help?
You can ask me, a government investigator
who was assigned to this case.
I can share this information.
Only the name.
- Thank you.
I have made 20 calls,
to find this researcher.
What did Lisa Bloom say?
He spoke as if Weinstein had
just a little vain in bed.
He spoke to me as "a Jew to a Jew"
and included Weinstein.
I had a long conversation with Lena Dunham
and Jenni Konner.
They want to help.
And they have so many numbers.
Did you know them before?
- I don't know anyone.
I started in April and...
- The Courier is calling!
Hello. Megan Twohey here.
Thanks for calling back. Still.
How can I help?
- Do you remember the case?
There are hundreds of
cases of sexual harassment.
It was given to you
and closed very quickly.
This is not unusual.
It was filed against Miramax.
What is Miramax?
Harvey, I have read
comprehensive reports.
Rose is like a disturbed person
and a pathological liar.
Obviously comes from his ridiculous
smear campaign against you.
He is dangerous.
You have every right to be concerned.
Feel that I need you
to help you against the Roses of the world.
Because I am
represented so many.
I would like to meet you,
to talk about this in more detail.
You should be the hero of this story.
Not a bad guy.
Best wishes, Lisa Bloom.
Trying to get hold of an assistant,
who worked in his 20s at Miramax.
And one day he just disappeared.
He left the table under
just his running shoes.
I haven't found him yet,
but his mother lives in Queens.
I thought I'd go and knock on the door.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
I was waiting for your mother to come.
I'll call her right away. What shall I say?
No, I actually came to you.
What can I do for you?
My name is Megan Twohey. I'm
I'm an investigative reporter for the New York Times.
Can you...
- Go back up.
Could we have a little chat?
Your time in Miramax.
I can't believe it,
that you found me.
I've been waiting 25 years for this.
I would ask you
a few questions.
What do you know?
That you were at the beginning of your career.
And that you were doing well.
And then something happened.
And then you disappeared.
And that your father threatened
to go to court.
All I can say is that...
I had with Miramax
a business disagreement.
And it was solved.
Friendly...
And we agreed
not to talk about it.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
So...
Situation resolved?
Yes.
There are women,
who have made agreements.
Agreements that force
them into silence.
But we have managed to
rewrite them.
There are ways to do this
avoid this limitation and report the story.
The source may remain anonymous.
I should go back to my room.
Sorry. I cancelled your visit
to your mother's completely upside down.
I don't want you
keep you away from your family.
Would this be acceptable,
if I gave you my number?
He was scared of the hoof, Jodi.
He wants to talk.
He really does. - Does he?
Absolutely incredible.
Gwyneth Paltrow called.
He told me about the incident
Peninsula Hotel.
Peninsula? What the hell?
- Exactly.
The same place where Ashley met her husband.
- What happened?
Hell, it's him. I have to go.
Hello.
- Megan, we were just chatting.
Please excuse,
but I have to say.
Good luck. Honestly too.
If you sign it,
you won't tell anyone?
Yes. It could have been bullying.
Sometimes it comes down to
just some big boys,
who do not want their
trade secrets being spilled.
Are you also on such a contract
No.
So shops have secrets,
but newspapers don't?
I think that almost everyone and everything
has a secret.
What's yours?
I'll tell you about it one day.
Do you have any secrets?
- Of course.
Of course I have a secret.
Hello?
- John Schmidt?
My name is Megan Twohey.
I'm a reporter for the New York Times.
I don't know what you want from me.
You were the Chief Financial Officer at Miramax.
Women who received these benefits,
cannot open their mouths.
If they did,
they would be taken to court.
But if someone could freely
to talk about payments,
it would be very useful.
What payments, John?
I am not asking for your official quote,
but merely your perspective
about it,
what might have happened then.
I'll have to think about it.
OK?
- OK.
Sorry,
for showing up unexpectedly.
Have a nice evening.
- Have a nice evening.
Hello. Can you hear me?
- Yes.
Thank you for agreeing with me
to talk to you on Saturday.
I hope the links were of some use.
It was. There was also something strange.
I can not be certain
Access information.
For the EEOC, information is important.
What didn't you find?
Against which company have been filed the most
sexual harassment allegations?
But no one had permission
to tell me that.
Yes, it is confidential
information.
Do you think this is right?
But Equal Employment Opportunities
Commission is a source of information?
Our rules
are reviewed every year.
Internal Commission notice on which companies
have received the most complaints?
Yes, we know, but we must not
share this information.
So no woman,
who applies for a job anywhere,
must not look at a given employer
records of harassment.
That's right. You should probably talk
someone in a higher position.
I intend to do just that. But will your
don't you think this whole thing is bizarre?
That the Commission exists to,
to protect people,
but its rules do not allow sharing
information that would protect people.
Megan, I am not the head of the EEOC.
I just wanted to help.
And you did.
And it's the weekend...
Thank you very much.
- Okay.
Anyway...
- Vision.
Imeline. Incredible.
Mira? Or equivalent
Equal Employment Opportunities Commission?
Both.
Hello.
- Hello.
We are like twins of reporters.
- Yes-
Do I change my clothes?
- No. Let's go.
Kena.
- You look amazing.
Hello. How was the ride?
- Hello.
It was very good.
I'm Helen, Gwyneth's assistant.
Gwyneth will be right with you.
Thank you.
So it's a complete pattern.
It's a pattern of behaviour.
Gwyneth was called to the hotel room,
to a business meeting
and then threatened with dismissal,
if she told him no.
He told his agent,
but nobody did anything.
Is Gwyneth ready
to speak on the record?
He really wants to.
- I think he does and he doesn't.
He fears it could become
a yellow sex scandal.
Gwyneth was 23 years old,
Rose was also. They were so young.
Tell me all about it,
when you get back. Vision.
These women are only willing to
talk... - If they jump together.
Yes.
Take it upon yourself.
- No, take it yourself. You're not that scary.
I'm not scary for you?
No, it's just the length.
Hello. - Hello. We were
in the neighbourhood.
We are from the New York Times. You worked at
ever worked for Harvey Weinstein?
Do you think he will open his mouth?
Want to leave a message? Yes...
Confidentiality agreements
will never be further examined.
They rarely come up in court.
They are not taught in root schools.
And lawyers representing victims,
can receive up to 40% of the settlement.
This is motivation enough,
to support this system.
Most sexual harassment
cases are settled out of court.
And most of them
also have a confidentiality clause.
And the women who sign,
must surrender all supporting documents.
Your diaries, emails, phones...
Money is given for silence.
The culprits can therefore continue.
And these clauses are already
perfectly normal.
Women want to end it,
they need the money.
They don't want to be stigmatised
as liars or flirts.
It is often relied on alone.
I imagine that some women see the
these agreements as confessions of guilt.
They think,
it's a victory for them,
but in fact it is
a silence order.
And if you go to court with such a case,
then sexual harassment
laws are so weak.
There are none for freelancers or
if there are fewer than 15 people in the firm.
While most lawyers
prefer settlements,
because the economic risk is not so high.
How close are we to making them
actors to officially open their mouths?
Let's introduce them to the idea.
We have terrible stories about hotel rooms,
but there's no evidence.
We think they are ready to talk,
if they are not alone.
It's safer with more than one.
- And confidentiality agreements?
Three. Until now...
On Rose McGowan. Amber
We are pretty sure about Battilana.
And I would say the same for the former
assistant in Queens.
And no documents?
- We have no story to publish.
Hello.
- Team...
You have to imagine that every
every time you speak.
And that you are being followed. Do not let
Weinstein to talk to you.
Only if you do
do it officially.
I could with him
even have an informal chat.
Not if Harvey has anything to say,
he has to say it publicly.
I have been with him before
I have met.
It's ugly.
We are investigating the incident
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.
He accused Weinstein of
of molesting him.
The NYPD put a microphone on him and.
she got back in touch with Weinstein.
But the prosecutor disagreed
to press charges.
It was claimed that the recording was not enough,
to arrest the man.
Linda Fairstein worked in the prosecutor's office.
I sent him a message.
What do we need to do here?
- Nothing.
I take a shower.
Sit down and have a drink.
I don't yeah. Can I stay at the bar?
- Have a glass of water.
No, you have to come here now.
- No...
Please? I won't do anything to you. I promise.
- No, I don't want to.
Now you're already shaming me.
- Forgive me. I don't want to.
Yesterday was quite a day for me
I know...
I need to know people,
before they touch me.
I do nothing. Sit with me.
Don't shame me. I come here all the time.
I know, but I don't want to.
- Please sit there. Please.
One moment. Go to the bathroom.
- No, I can't.
Please. I don't want to do anything,
I don't want to do.
Listen to me now.
- I want to go down.
I do nothing. After this
you'll never see me again.
OK? Then that's all.
If you put me in this hotel
I'm not shaming you.
I just don't feel comfortable.
Sweetheart, let's not fight in the corridor.
- It's not trivial.
I swear I will do nothing.
I swear on behalf of my children.
Please come in. I'm a famous man.
I am very uncomfortable at the moment.
Please come to the room now.
And if you want to leave,
when a man comes with my jacket...
- Why did you touch my breast yesterday?
Please... Forgive me.
Step into the room. I'm used to it.
Are you used to it?
- Yes, step inside.
No, but I'm not used to it.
- I won't do it again. Sit here.
Please sit here for a moment.
- No, I don't want to.
If you do it now, you will...
Mine. Don't ever call me again.
OK? Forgive me.
I promise not to do anything.
I know, but yesterday was too much for me.
- One guy is coming.
I will never do anything to you again.
Five minutes.
Don't break in five minutes
your friendship with me.
Linda, Megan Twohey here.
How's it going?
I'm doing well, Megan.
How can I help?
I investigate the complaint
against Harvey Weinstein,
where the prosecution
was not filed two years ago.
You worked in the prosecutor's office.
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez?
Anyway...
- It seemed to disappear very quickly.
There was no criminal violation.
- The police thought there was.
Do you think it was processed
in any unusual way?
No guess.
Why would you say something like that?
Gwyneth?
- She's here.
I invited a few people to visit
and he turned up too.
I haven't seen him for several years.
He must know I spoke to you.
Why are you so sure,
there was no criminal offence?
Wasn't there a recording?
I don't think here
there is nothing to process. No.
Do you feel physically threatened?
I care about the people around me,
until he leaves.
This is a real shock. I know,
he's watching me. He wants me to know.
There is nothing he can do.
Gwyneth, I'm here.
Call me if you need me.
All right, vision.
Linda, do you know Harvey?
I have met him socially,
but we haven't visited each other.
So be it. We'll certainly talk soon.
Yes. Sight.
We have the opportunity to talk
A former Miramax executive.
Goals. When?
- Jodi will talk to him tomorrow.
Lord.
- What?
Ronan Farrow does for The New Yorker
Harvey Weinstein story.
What? Since when?
Not saying, but supposedly he already has.
several actors.
Ladies, here are the menus.
- Thank you.
This is unnecessary pressure,
but we must press on.
And we continue to be thorough.
Sorry. Hello!
Did you see my friend there?
He wanted to say hello.
Could you leave us alone?
We'll talk. - Absolutely.
I totally understand, but...
- We're in the middle of a conversation.
You should be doing something else.
- Fuck off.
"Keri fuck off?" I'd twist your...
- Keri fuck off!
Keri fuck off! Get the fuck out of here!
Keri fuck off! Out!
Frigiidsed litad.
Please excuse.
- Don't apologise.
Oli incident
Venice Film Festival.
The year was 1998.
What happened?
What angers me most is the silence.
Nobody talked about it then.
And now there is also silence.
He built silence
and the people were in agreement.
He spread fear
and discouraged workers.
The only alternative was to quit,
giving up everything in the name of
you've worked so hard for.
Afraid that you
become the next target,
so that people looked
In the company?
Yes, and also outside.
He betrayed the media and agents.
- How did he betray the media?
Allowing them access to the stars,
when the media is silent on something.
Silent on what?
Where do I start?
Harvey had...
What was it called...
At one conference Harvey had
had a physical altercation with a male staff member.
An out-of-court settlement was finally found.
And with women?
He tried endlessly
to get them.
What happened in Venice?
I don't want to,
to be quoted.
Understandable.
We were in Harvey's suite.
It was quite crowded.
And there were two assistants,
who sat shaking.
And Weinstein was there?
- Yes.
He talked about films
and ignored them.
But they were vibrating.
One out of fear, the other out of anger.
Could you tell me their names?
Yes.
There is another woman,
you should call.
Two assistants are Rowena Chiu
and Zelda Perkins.
We also have a third name...
Laura Madden.
And none of them
answer our calls.
So? You have to knock on their doors.
Yes...
They live in London,
Silicon Valley and Wales.
Can you get on the plane?
I'll talk it over with Ron first.
But yes... Sure.
Documents, confirmation.
You know what we need.
Hello.
Sorry to bother you.
I can see you're busy.
I am looking for Rowena Chiud.
Hello. Rowena is not here at the moment.
Can I give him a message?
When will he be back?
- My wife will be out of the country for a while.
Clear. I tried calling him.
Work-related matter?
- No. You must be Andrew Cheung?
I'm Jodi Kantor
New York Times.
What did you want to talk to Rowena about?
Let's find out the story from Miramax.
I flew here from New York.
Have you come this far?
- Yes.
Can we have a chat?
- Still.
I've spoken to people who have
worked under Harvey Weinstein.
You have reached Rowena
quite a long way back in time.
Let's write about it,
how he treats women.
And how does Rowena fit in?
Your wife worked at Miramax
for quite a few years. - Yes.
Mainly in Hong Kong.
I would like to hear how it was
working for Weinstein.
I am confused,
why can't this be done over the phone.
I tried to get hold of him...
It's always better to meet.
So...
And it's not official now.
As far as I know, your wife probably fell
Weinstein's victim,
when Rowena worked for him.
Rowena is not for me though
said anything like that.
In what sense "fell victim"?
Could you be more specific?
I was told that your wife might have gotten a
Weinstein a settlement.
Do I look like the type,
whose wife got the leper money?
Could you have got it from someone
confused with someone else?
Please excuse me for disturbing you.
Please give this to Rowena.
When you talk to other people,
why do you need to talk to Rowena?
And you come to my driveway...
To what then did he fall victim?
It is complex.
- I ask you to expand it.
I think the best would be,
if you ask Rowena yourself.
Have a nice day.
I couldn't lie to him.
And it turned out he didn't know.
So what,
if London is a replay?
No.
- I spoke to one of the UK lawyers.
Said it was irresponsible to investigate the
confidentiality agreement
about a breach of.
This is not done. A court case would lie ahead.
- To hell with him!
Pretty much, Jodi. To hell with him.
He knows nothing.
I wish I was a smoker.
But I'm staring
a brick wall.
And I can only think: "Ass."
It's OK. Fuck it.
And documents...
Laura, ahead
a full mastectomy.
We should operate as
as soon as possible.
I understand.
Hello.
- Hello...
Laura, I'm Jodi Kantor
New York Times.
I hope you have my messages
received.
I'm currently in California,
but I'm coming to London tomorrow.
Hello, Jodi.
- Hello.
I'm so happy,
to finally be able to talk to you.
I understand you once worked for Harvey
Harvey Weinstein at the Miramax in London?
Is it?
Laura?
Laura...
Is there anything I can do to help?
No. I can't talk about it at the moment.
Kullake... Come here.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
- I'm so sorry, Mom.
But please.
Tea.
- Thank you.
Many have tried
to write this story.
He always takes it off the track.
- We are aware of this.
And we won't let that happen.
Are you all right, Zelda?
- Yes.
You started working at Miramax,
when you were 21 years old? - Yes.
I was an assistant in the London office.
And how was work?
- Excellent.
But everything changed,
when Harvey came to London.
In what way?
- Everything became available to him.
And what was involved?
Meetings on the script,
discussions
and personal issues.
Such as...
I had to go to his hotel,
to wake up Harvey.
I had to get her shower ready,
help her out of bed.
Usually he was naked
and tried to pull me on top of him.
What did you do?
- I pushed him away.
Humour or aggression
worked best.
Harvey was either excited
or furious.
Never knew,
what you'd get with him.
Did someone on staff give
give you advice about him?
Yes. Once a girl suggested
to always wear a jacket.
And always sit in an armchair.
Never on the sofa,
next to him.
It helped.
And so I knew,
it wasn't just me.
What exactly happened?
- Bullying.
Emotional violence.
I was just too young,
to understand it.
Harvey wanted people to
to submit to him.
And if they didn't?
- Then he fell to roaring.
And he spat. He could
destroy someone in a matter of seconds.
Were you afraid of him?
Yes. We were all afraid.
It had been going on for three years.
You went to the Venice Film Festival.
I left my job after that.
What happened?
- I can't talk about everything.
What can you tell me about?
There was one new assistant.
She was my age.
He was nice.
He was very smart.
And he did it for the first time alone with Harvey
evening meeting about the script.
And I asked him to call me,
if things got complicated with Harvey.
Was he chasing her?
- No.
Harvey said: "I don't like
Asian women or Jewish women."
But that night...
- He called you. No.
The next morning
he came to me.
She cried.
He was hysterical.
Rowena, what happened?
And I held him.
Did he tell you,
what Weinstein did?
Not exactly.
Only that no-one should be allowed to
but I knew.
I knew that Weinstein probably...
What?
- He was so upset.
I knew it could be
only the worst thing.
I calmed him down
and went straight to Harvey.
He had a meeting with Scorsese,
who hated him, so it was a
Harvey a very big deal.
I went straight to him
and said very clearly:
"You have to come with me now."
- You confronted him immediately? - Yes.
I was so angry.
And he stood up in front of everyone.
He followed me like a sheep.
Then I knew,
that he had done it.
And then?
- He denied it.
"I swear on my husband
and the lives of my children,"
"that I did not abuse
this young woman."
And then I knew he was lying.
He always used these words,
in order to get clean.
Is an assistant
informed the police?
He told no one.
We returned to London,
we both resigned.
My line manager suggested
us to find a good lawyer.
I didn't know where to find one.
I found a company near my office.
And then I thought everything was simple.
Criminal procedure and liability.
But our lawyer said,
we don't have a chance either.
That we only had the chance to lepperaha
to get. I was totally against that.
So that no money would have to be paid to anyone.
We just wanted to stop him.
The UK police were not involved?
- We had no case.
There was no evidence
and a police report from Venice.
And rape is very complicated
to get a conviction.
Lawyers said that damage checks
was the only logical way forward.
Then I said, "Fine.
We have our own conditions."
The conditions Harvey had to meet,
to get our signature.
And what were the conditions?
- We insisted,
that if Harvey makes a two-year
a new confidentiality agreement within two years,
Disney must also be informed.
Otherwise he would lose his job.
The second condition was this,
that he go to therapy.
I had to be there at the beginning,
so he couldn't lie to the therapist.
We asked the HR department to create
a system to protect women.
And it seemed that if we can
to get to these things,
this is the price for our silence.
That we pay for it,
to stop its activities.
We signed. They had
crazy conditions for us.
What were the conditions?
I tried to remember them.
We did not receive a copy of the contract.
- What?
I got my own contract
only the right to visit.
It is...
This is incredible.
- But you remembered the conditions.
I also asked for a letter,
with some conditions.
One condition was
"We will give our best,"
"not to assist the police in criminal
or civil proceedings."
We could not
talk to our family.
Or with a doctor.
Finally, we signed.
We were given some money.
And I felt,
I was completely broken.
I also tried to apply elsewhere.
Everyone kept asking:
"Why did you come away from Harvey?"
All assumed,
that I had slept with him.
It was terrible.
So what did you do?
- I went to visit a friend in Guatemala.
I stayed there for five years.
I didn't have a chance
work in the film industry.
And I couldn't speak freely either.
So I worked with horses.
You have lost a lot.
These are original letters.
I had to get their permission,
if I wanted to contact a therapist.
or talk to an accountant.
"There must be no talk of any media-
publication that exists at the moment"
"or in the future."
Jodi, it's bigger than Weinstein.
This is about the system,
that protects abusers.
Take them.
I want you to use them.
I have to go now.
Is it dark?
It's four o'clock here.
Did you drink tea?
- A little.
Who are you meeting?
With a couple of women.
- Can you find me a box?
And a cat hat for Violet.
- I'm working on it.
Have you managed without me?
Still. Come back tomorrow.
- I will.
So what did they do?
The women you meet.
Let's talk about it,
when you're a little older.
Are they criminals?
Bank robbers? - No.
Was it rape?
Talia, I'm not from your mouth
that word before.
Guys say it all the time.
Girls say it too.
They should not use it.
They shouldn't use the word freely.
Forgive me.
- No, you did nothing wrong.
Are you angry with me.
- No, Talia. I care about you.
I miss you, like no one
has bitten off a piece of me.
You disappeared, Talia. Talia!
They are trying to survive.
And he runs the show.
He helps them.
- He will kill them!
Hello?
- What? No!
Obviously help them when needed
Who's Potts?
Mum. Another call from America.
I said, darling.
Tell all the reporters.
No, he claims,
that you worked together.
Pamela Lubell?
Hywel wants its own yellow cushion
No.
We do not take mattresses.
- Why?
Pamela?
Jummel.
Hello, Pamela. How are you?
Several decades have passed.
Tean, Laura. It really is a lot of time
passed. How is life going?
Well.
- How's it going?
Yes, I'm fine.
- Very nice to hear.
Laura, are you
have any reporters called,
who are trying to Harvey
to write stories?
Yes, there is.
I didn't talk to them.
- That's very good to hear.
Journalists from all over the world...
Once upon a time, wasn't it all much nicer?
Harvey was always very generous.
This was not my experience.
Laura, can you confirm,
that you're not talking to anyone?
What? What did you say?
If you have a project,
I can offer it to Harvey.
I have nothing.
And I talk to who I want.
I need a morning
to Cornwall in the morning.
Lend Cornwall?
- Yes. Newquay Airport?
Usually you go there by train.
- Okay, by train.
It's a nice place to relax.
- Yes.
Hywel wants to play by the stones.
Is it OK? - Yes, it is.
Is he your eldest child?
- Yes.
She is 13 years old.
Did you grow up in Ireland?
- Yes.
And your first job was background-
in 1992.
They were filming near us.
I really liked that.
And then I heard that Miramax
is also making a movie near
and got a job there as an assistant.
I was ecstatic.
It was very nice.
And when will you meet Harvey Weinstein
did you meet?
Shortly after that.
I got a job working under him directly.
I was doing household chores,
answering the phone...
I was very happy,
when I was offered the job.
He was sweet. Said to be
heard how hard I work.
And I was just excited.
I was 21 years old, very young,
but enthusiastic.
When he said he would give me London
office in London,
I was very happy.
He said this at the meeting?
- Yes.
He was wearing a dressing gown,
when he opened the door,
but I thought it was
Hollywood.
But if we were already
had been chatting for a while,
he asked me,
if I would give him a massage.
I refused.
He was very specific. He said,
it's not a romantic prayer.
That everyone gives him a massage.
This is part of the job.
Suddenly I thought,
I was the problem.
That it was me,
who sexualised it.
That I was just young and young at heart.
I put my hands on his shoulders,
but I couldn't put my hands
move his body.
Just standing there,
my hands didn't move...
And then he said,
first he'd give me a massage.
To relax.
And then he said:
"All the girls do it."
"It's just a job."
And then he said:
"Take off your shirt."
He said it very bluntly.
"Take off the bra."
I did it.
I was scared of hooves.
I was just thinking,
I'll get over it.
So I'll do it.
And then my pants came off.
And he towered over me.
He masturbated.
I asked him to leave me alone.
But he was always asking new things.
And then he thought he could shower.
to go to the shower, so I got up.
And he continued to masturbate.
I was always crying and poking.
Water was running down my head.
And he continued to masturbate.
Then he got angry.
My crying was so loud,
it must have disturbed him.
And he left the bathroom.
And I locked the door.
And I heard him on the other side of the door.
I heard him masturbating there.
Finally I went back to my room.
I grabbed my clothes and personal
and ran away.
I ran down the street.
I have never in my life
I have never run so fast.
How do you feel now
about this?
I think it determined to some extent
the later direction of my life.
To make one big mistake
determined me and all my decisions.
Yes...
I felt ashamed.
I felt ashamed,
for letting him do something like that.
You thought he was something like this
to other girls?
I thought he
had probably still tried.
But that they...
But that other girls
had all refused.
He would have that day
as if he had taken my voice away.
Just at the moment when I was
just starting to find it.
Yes?
- Harvey Weinstein is calling you.
Connect me. Thank you.
Dean, how's it going?
Harvey here.
Hello, Harvey.
How can I help?
If I hadn't started making films,
I would have become a journalist.
Dean, I heard that someone
is doing a story on me.
Yes. If you want to talk to reporters
to talk on the record, they're fine.
I want to talk to you, Dean.
- Talk to reporters about your concerns.
Forgive me. The job is waiting.
Are you putting the call off?
- If you have nothing else to say.
I love the truth.
People think
a lot of stories.
Be careful.
- It's all right, Harvey. Vision.
Hello, Chanel. - Hello, Dean.
- Hi, Tim.
Matt, do you have a moment?
- Yes.
What do we have?
- The biggest thing is documents,
which Jodi in London
Zelda Perkins in London.
Rose does not want to officially
open your mouth,
but he has given us permission
to write about his contract.
We are trying to find a way,
how to confirm this.
Harvey recently offered him
a million dollars for his silence.
And? - Rose refused.
She doesn't want us to quote her.
Officially, they don't want to say anything.
Confidentiality agreements are a problem
Laura Madden did not sign it.
She is the only one who could speak freely
Ashley and Gwyneth did not write
signed nowhere either,
but they are not ready to talk.
- Laura Madden has another problem.
She has breast cancer,
has to have an operation.
I leave Rowena Chiule
more messages, but she doesn't reply.
So more agreements
we can't prove?
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez
went down this route quite firmly.
And John Schmidt confirmed,
that Miramax found a reconciliation
with a woman I visited in Queens.
- Anything from the New Yorker article?
No.
Lanny Davis and David Boies
want to talk to us.
What do you think?
- Do we not want to wait,
to get yourself a Weinstein
a formal interview?
It's your decision, Binky.
- I'd at least like to talk to Lanny.
Let's see what he has to say.
- Harvey is not always so rational.
I am not here as his representative,
to pull off a story.
I want to know if you are using anything
Rose McGowan's argument.
Then we have a chance to stand up to it
Of course.
I know that you are extremely diligent in your research.
Lanny, you can answer everything.
I assume that all this is allowed
Yes, of course.
I do not ask,
to name your sources,
but would it be possible in general
know where your story comes from?
Let's examine Weinstein's problematic
behaviour with women.
So be it.
Harvey completely rejects all
assault or rape allegations.
He has done nothing criminal.
But he is aware of the complaints,
that have been lodged against him.
He is making an effort,
to improve his behaviour.
Powerful men of an older generation
is changing its mind
the word 'consensual'.
Why women don't know,
that anything is consensual,
while at the same time some men feel,
that the same thing is consensual.
Would you like to expand on this?
I believe that the development of men
can tell a decent story.
And on this topic also from Harvey.
Would he be ready to join us
to talk about this officially?
He needs his wife
and children.
This is the most important thing.
You are absolutely convinced,
that Rose McGowan's
the rape accusation is not true.
Why?
Did he talk about it immediately
with anyone? Was his distress noticeable?
He talked about it
to his manager and lawyer.
Harvey knew,
that Rose had a problem.
But not that Rose is
accused him of rape.
So I pulled
the rape.
Everything below the line...
He was aware of feelings and concerns.
Which test?
What can I do for you?
did not concern rape,
what were they about?
There is only one answer...
Exploitation was felt because of the power-
The power dynamic between them was unequal.
There is spiritual compulsion,
which is not physical compulsion.
Lisa Bloom is working with Harvey,
to help him figure things out.
Lisa Bloom?
- Yes.
When Harvey became McGowan
knew about his troubles at the time,
how did he respond?
I think he was trying to reach
a legal solution with him.
And how these legal solutions
would you characterise?
I think that Harvey understood that McGowan
did not consider the incident normal.
I'm not talking about rape,
I'm talking about this,
how Harvey Rose affected McGowan.
And rather than fight it...
"Selmet combat..."
So what happened?
I think it was reached
out-of-court settlements
instead of going to court.
According to Harvey
it was better to reach an agreement, even if
you had done nothing wrong.
He preferred out-of-court settlements.
Were there other respondents
intimate relations with women,
when Weinstein reached the agreement?
Let's say that at the moment I have to
I also find out,
which are my legal restrictions.
Even if the background system
confirm agreements...
The answer is yes.
There have been other agreements.
How much?
Recognise so early,
that there have been a number of agreements.
They are in serious trouble.
We need to get the number.
And we need to ratify every agreement.
- I'm working on it.
Have you been exposed to
Diana Filip?
No. - I told you about one
a presentation at a conference.
He keeps calling.
- Did you check his background?
The security adviser said he was clean,
but who has the arbitrary
for people?
I worked at Miramax.
Talk to Irwin Reiter.
He hates Weinstein.
Hello. Everything OK?
- Did I upset you?
Yes. What's up?
What do you know about Irwin Reiter?
Wait. I made a whole file on him.
I have to write a very good email.
Hello. Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me.
Do you want me dead?
Irwin...
You have been 30 years
Weinstein accountant for 30 years?
I pay the bill and I'm entitled to
to leave in five minutes.
So...
What do you want to know?
We have information from several Weinstein
leper money paid in the 1990s.
Money from the bank went to actresses
and former employees.
Can you tell me
tell me about it?
Can you confirm that they were paid?
What was your perspective?
My perspective?
Was company money used?
You wrote to me that we live
in the same tiny world. - Yes.
Summers in the Catskills.
Eined Lefty's and the tubes.
What do you remember from these holidays?
I remember so many different things.
I saw it for the first time
my grandmother's bare hands.
I knew that these tattoos
mean something powerful.
How?
- I just felt it.
Did your family talk about it?
Who else are you talking to?
I cannot publish it.
My parents could not go there.
We barely talked about it.
So mysterious. Isn't it?
Why do some families talk about...
Some don't...
The money Weinstein spent,
was insane.
I tried repeatedly to get the Board
to do something about him.
But his behaviour was just ignored.
And he was kept in the shed.
- Why?
Have you spoken to the LOC?
Or with ZP?
Who is the LOC?
There is one memo.
I want to ask you something,
that confuses me.
Why do you ask about the 1990s,
when Weinstein has committed
so many more recent infringements?
I have to go.
I'll call you.
- Irwin.
Mum.
I had a nightmare.
- Sweetheart, come here.
Everything is fine.
I heard that Ambra Battilana Gutierrez
received a seven-figure sum.
And that incident sound file
is now in Weinstein's possession.
These reconciliation payments, Lanny...
How many are we talking about?
I can't say.
You even know it.
I don't want names.
Very good background information would be known
how many treaties you are aware of.
I'm not the bad guy here.
- I know that.
My job is to lead
the facts to reporters.
But I can't help.
I'm struck by the number 40...
That would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?
Right?
This is not 40.
Really too.
That's less than 40.
Very good. It's a relief.
- Yes.
Less than half of the 40...
What the hell? We heard,
Ronan Farrow is also writing the story.
No, no.
That's it. Done.
You are not a bad person for me,
Lanny.
Never been.
I respect you.
I love you too.
It's all coming out, Lanny.
Publicly.
- It usually does.
What am I laughing at?
Megan...
Lanny...
Say 8-12 lep.
And do you think this is normal?
That men do
so many contract payments?
Yes.
It looks like we are
so close.
Do you think we can get it?
What if we can't?
I have nightmares about it.
- Lord! Me too!
We know everything, but I'm afraid we may be
take that knowledge to the grave.
The story comes out. I'm afraid it will,
people won't be interested.
And not to be slowed down,
let alone stop him.
A whole ocean of infringements...
Can you imagine how many Harveys
active in the world every day?
Sometimes I wonder...
When I got to Mira...
Whether the whole trauma,
not just in me,
but in all women,
I've talked to...
Is it the darkness, the constant violence...
Did it explode inside me?
Maybe it's part of the depression,
that affects women?
Do you wish you were not
taken the story?
What about you?
No.
The last time we met,
you mentioned a memo.
It was still from an executive..
It was wide-ranging and slimming.
He sent it to the Board.
When did this happen?
How did they react?
There was a brief turmoil inside the company
and then he left.
What did it say?
To the firm chose
a toxic working environment.
Could someone please
still have a copy?
Hello.
Sorry for arriving so late.
Are you OK? - Talia was up for a long time,
Violet woke up twice.
I got a lot of emails from people who have
furious about the insurance story.
It will be a very big story.
Here are hundreds of us.
And there's a hurricane heading for Florida.
I'll fly there somehow
and move my dad somewhere else,
before it is blown away.
And my eye twitches a little nervously.
Let me see.
Take it easy!
- Can you hold Crabby for a second?
Hello. Jodi Kantor is here.
- This is Rowena Chiu.
I'm in New York.
Still want to meet up?
I could not
tell anyone about it.
Not to your parents,
not even to your husband.
Why not?
I grew up
in an immigrant household.
I was taught,
that I had to mind my own business,
work hard
and not attract too much attention.
Chinese culture was a model I followed,
I had to protect my family.
And I was young, scared.
Can you tell me,
what happened in Venice?
This is not official now. Yes?
I had evening shifts. I looked at
Harvey and I went over the notes and scripts.
One evening we worked
and he kept trying to touch me.
I didn't want to make him angry.
He's a very big man.
I tried to draw attention
to the notes.
It all took a couple of hours.
I tried to avoid him.
How did you do it?
I pushed him away.
I was wearing two pairs of socks,
which would have given me extra time.
But finally he pushed me down.
Not by force...
It was more like a game.
Then he pushed my legs apart.
And he said:
"Please... Just one push
and it's all over."
I managed to escape.
I was traumatised.
I was a Christian.
I was still with my first lover.
And you shared it with Zelda?
Zelda was a rabid fanatic
and bravely confronted him.
We both stepped back.
But after leaving Miramax
I couldn't find a new job.
I was told that if I already had Harvey under the
why did I leave?
Confidentiality agreement,
which we signed...
It says that if I ever have a
have trouble finding a job in the film world,
should I contact Harvey for help
or his lawyer Hutensky.
I asked them for a letter of recommendation.
And Hutensky...
He kept repeating...
What did he say?
How much Harvey valued me.
We agreed,
that I would return to Miramax,
under a strict framework.
I agreed to join
Hong Kong office.
I thought I was there
far enough away from him.
I thought I was safe there.
But it was terrible.
I was the best sasipundar.
I felt very alone.
I could not
tell anyone about it.
Isolation started to eat me up inside.
One day I disappeared from work.
I wanted to be dead.
I could not be,
how to go forward,
how to live with it.
I tried to kill myself.
But I didn't know how.
I felt that I had succeeded
even fail at it.
I want to give it to you.
This is a description from an actress,
you know.
What?
- He won't open his mouth.
I can't reflect him in the story.
I knew nothing about it.
I thought it was just
some kind of extra-marital nonsense.
No.
Do with it
whatever you want.
Son of a bitch! Here it is.
Here it is!
Official record.
3 November 2015.
I have been repeatedly
harassed and abused.
I am a 28-year-old woman trying to
earn a living and make a career.
Mind is
sexualised and belittled.
I have been afraid to make a noise,
but silence makes me
real discomfort.
He told me: "I'm a bad boy,
but at least I'm honest."
According to him, I am eligible
only to make children.
An assistant told me that Harvey
told him to massage himself,
as Harvey himself always was.
It was terrible to see,
how out of control he was.
When I complained
to the head of HR,
was answered: "Let me know if he tells you
hits you or physically crosses the border."
Harvey Weinstein is 64 years old
world-famous man.
And it's his company.
Balance of power:
I: zero.
Harvey Weinstein: ten.
Go to writing.
- The story is there.
When we publish it,
everything else will come out.
Contact Lauren O'Connor.
- Contact The Weinstein Company for comment.
I call Lance Maerov.
- Write! Let's get ready.
My client does not want,
to be named.
This memo should not have
have been made public.
Lauren?
- My client is here.
But he's too out of touch,
Lauren...
I am sorry,
that this is difficult for you.
We do not publish the whole memo.
And let's imply that the source was not a
yours and you declined to comment.
But we are going to use your name,
to make the article credible.
We will always exclude all sexual mis-
victims of sexual abuse remain anonymous.
But since you were a witness, you will your
makes the story that much stronger.
Hello, Lance. Megan Twohey here
From the New York Times.
We have a memo from Lauren O'Connor
The Weinstein Company.
What? - We want to know,
what you did with it.
What did the Board do?
Lance?
We tried already in 2015
because of a police complaint.
But this memo?
It was there and suddenly it was gone?
We were all
Harvey's behaviour worried us all!
May I quote you, Lance?
Yes. Yes, you can.
Lauren's complaint...
It was withdrawn.
Several days after it was received.
So I forgot about it.
- Why was it withdrawn?
I really don't know.
Are you sure that young women are not
just want to sleep with a producer,
to improve your career?
We have several
decades of indictments.
Harassment, assault,
rape. And we are aware
several confidentiality agreements.
I know you need to talk to the board,
but could you wait until Monday?
Is it possible?
So be it.
Ashley, I know that in an ideal world...
many women would join forces.
But that's not happening at the moment.
But we have a number of incidents
and a sickly pattern.
You would open your mouth alone, but you would be supported by
by a mountain of evidence.
Ashley?
- Yes.
Thinking about it
very seriously, Jodi.
Luban.
- Thank you, Ashley.
We publish what we have.
- We have to think about the New Yorker,
but can't we wait a bit?
So that these women would agree.
No. We must publish.
- It's different from the real story.
This can be the first arrow.
Later, more women emerge.
The reaction could be
much stronger, Dean.
That's enough. We must act.
How much time we give
to respond to Weinstein?
24 hours?
- I'd give double. 48 hours.
This is fair.
- Two days?
How many people will Harvey reach
and his team talk to in that time?
David?
- I lean towards Rebecca.
We want to be legally immune.
- Very good.
Let's call Lanny. Chat with Harvey
and his team tomorrow at one o'clock.
Let's show him what we've got, and give him
two days to respond.
Midnight is here. Go home.
- We're going home! - Good evening!
If only one woman had been
to open her mouth.
Why is he going through the tunnel?
We only needed one woman.
Jodi, stop.
Never mind!
Perhaps we should have
put them all in one room.
A room would make no difference.
They don't want to be alone
say anything on the record.
Would you like to make your voice heard alone?
Hello.
Two hours have passed.
It's a tactic, but...
I have other things to do.
Dean, Harvey Weinstein and his
Charles Harder, his lawyer.
So be it. Let's get going.
Ready?
- We are ready.
Can be connected.
Harvey? Charles?
- Dean?
How are you going to do that, Harvey?
I don't want to do that.
Are they there?
Are the reporters there?
- We are all here.
Who have you spoken to?
We sent you the names,
who we'll be reflecting, Harvey.
Who have you spoken to?
Have you spoken to Gwyneth Paltrow?
- Gwyneth is not in the story, Harvey.
Let me answer them,
who have said something on the record!
Harvey, many times
have you paid leper money?
We were told 8-12 times.
These are your words, not mine!
When Lanny said something, he spoke
on his own behalf, not on behalf of his client!
How much time do you give us
to reply?
We need two weeks.
You get two days.
- It all goes back to the 1990s!
When you screw up and don't talk
the truth, how do you look in the mirror?
90 minutes have passed, Harvey.
We will now conclude.
Harvey challenged Lanny
the information given by Lanny about the 8-12 agreement.
We need evidence.
8-12 agreements need to be proven.
Who can you call there?
- Find out from David Glasser.
Ashley calls.
Accept. Reply.
- I accept, I accept.
Ashley.
How are you doing?
- Fine.
I just went for a run.
Very nice.
Running is good for you.
I spoke to my lawyer and I thought,
what the right thing to do would be.
Yes, of course.
Course.
Yes...
I am ready to be
a named source in your research.
I have to be.
As a woman and a Christian.
Jodi?
- Yes?
Talk to you soon.
Yes. Ashley, thank you. Thank you.
Ashley agreed.
He agreed.
Ashley agreed!
- She really was, Jodi. She really was.
Ok, now the whole story is coming out.
Ashley Judd's quote goes to the libs
Peninsula Hotel suite.
This must stop the good Juddi
I'm working on it.
The story goes out now,
when the story is nicely put together.
We're getting to work.
Hello? - Hello, David. Here
Megan Twohey from the New York Times.
I thought it would be fair to offer the company
President to comment.
Are you up to speed?
I am. The Bureau held
an extraordinary meeting.
We have 8-12 per agreement
conflicting reports.
We will leave you unnamed,
but is 8-12 an accurate number?
How many?
- 8-12.
Is of such magnitude
is it adequate to use?
8-12...
Yes, yes. That's accurate.
Appreciate it, David. Thank you.
David Glasser confirmed
8-12 confidentiality agreements.
Yes. I understand it's difficult.
What is happening? Is Harvey at the end of the pipe?
- Lanny. Weinstein refuses to answer.
Lanny, I understand you...
Lanny, help me out of this mess.
We're being bombarded by five different lawyers.
We are not talking to five different lawyers.
Call your people to order
and get us an answer.
This is not the answer. It is a novel.
- Women are called liars.
And journalism.
- It's a legal embarrassment.
I sent these 18 pages
in response to three paragraphs.
I asked them for data
and summoned them to court.
Let's see,
how quickly they reply.
The wait is over. Weinstein
wants to meet. He's on his way here.
Shall we let him in?
Let him in.
- I can do it.
Hello, Lisa.
Are there no more of you?
OK, after me.
Is it there? Was it put up?
- Yes. They have it too.
So it's both.
What happened?
- What was to be expected.
Attempts were made to discredit the actors.
What's going on?
Harvey and his team told Variety
and The Hollywood Reporter.
What?
- About us and the story.
He says it surprises him.
This is bad.
You need to write fast.
We lost your privacy.
Show me the link.
We need to start with.
This is where to start.
Go home.
I'll read it myself.
Why shouldn't I be in Washington right now
Post interview,
based on your opacity?
You want some kind of list,
who we are contacting for this story?
And if we don't give it to you,
you threaten us?
If you use Gwyneth Paltrow,
No, I don't.
Are you talking to Gwyneth Paltrow?
Dean here. Here's the deal...
You need to give us your comments.
I'll press the button now.
Dean, let me tell you
something about intimidation.
I'm talking to the Post. Really too!
- Call them. It's OK.
You can call the Washington Post.
Harvey, I'm trying to be honest with you.
You threaten me, Dean.
- No, I want your comment.
Please send it to us.
We'll start publishing the story right away.
I want to give it to you.
- Thank you.
Is Gwyneth inside?
- She's not in the story!
Let's do it now, Harvey.
We want to give you every word,
you want to say.
Say them now.
I also have a newspaper that comes
to be printed. I'm walking away now.
Talk to my reporters.
Be well.
Good luck.
- You are carelessly ignoring the whole truth!
You want the big story,
but these accusations don't hold water!
We don't want a big story, Lisa.
Harvey is taking time off,
to focus on this issue.
Will you, Harvey?
- Yes.
I'll take some time off.
From the company?
- Yes.
I want to dedicate time to learning.
To learning and to my listening.
This is where the dual unit comes in.
And here...
This is Laura.
Hello. Laura, how are you?
Yes, I'm a combe.
I have an operation today.
It starts now.
I did not write
I did not sign any contract.
My mouth is not gagged.
And I want to speak on behalf of women,
who can't do it.
I have three daughters.
I don't want any of them
should bullying
or abuse as normal.
You can use
everything I have said.
I agree.
Speaking officially.
Thank you, Laura.
Thank you.
Thinking of you.
Gorgeous Laura...
Is everything OK, Laura?
- Yes. I'm fine.
Thank you.
Everything is really fine.
Their comments came.
I'm looking for quotes.
You are so clever.
Did you find the quotes?
- I'm working on them.
It's ready.
- Let's read it one last time.
Yes.
- One moment...
Yes.
So be it.
Suitable?
Yes.
- Suitable.
The following month, 82 women accused
Harvey Weinsteini

against sexual abuse.
Women who opened their mouths around the world,

for the first time -
is impossible to count.
Their testimonies led to reforms
workplaces, changes in the law,
Responsibility

referring to sexual harassment
and violence.
Many disputes on the subject
are still going on today.
