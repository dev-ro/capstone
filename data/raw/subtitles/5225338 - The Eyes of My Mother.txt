Saint Francis spent many years
living alone in the woods.
Then one night,
he saw an angel burning in sky.
And when he woke up...
he had stigmata.
But loneliness can do
strange things to the mind.
Eventually he died of an eye condition
that also would have caused psychosis.
Francisca.
Cow eyes are very similar to human eyes.
The construction is almost exactly the same.
The only difference is they're bigger.
In Portugal,
we used to practice surgery on cows.
Here, they practice on people.
This is how they kill it.
- Francisca.
- Francisca?
I was just getting to know
your daughter. I'm Charlie.
Is your husband at home?
He'll be home any second now.
But we're not interested in whatever
you're trying to sell.
I'm not trying to sell you anything.
May I come inside for a second?
Just to use the restroom.
It'll only take a second.
You have a lovely home.
Have you lived here a long time?
The bathroom is through
the living room to the right.
Thanks.
Is your husband usually late?
You said you expected him here any second.
Bathroom is through the living room,
to your right.
Would you show me?
I think you should show me the way.
Ma'am.
I'm trying to be polite.
Now, we can try this one more time
before I start to become unreasonable.
I am sorry, sir,
but I really need you to leave.
I don't quite know what you're planning.
Hey there, Franny.
I'm gonna need you to sit over there
on that chair and be real quiet.
Can you do that for me?
Now, why don't you be a good host
and show me where that bathroom is?
Well, all right now.
Onwards and upwards.
Reporting from the State Fire
Marshal's Office today,
request for all municipal authorities
to ban the sale of an imported ragdoll,
which has been found to be highly flammable.
State Fire Marshal George Chanovec says
every fire department in the state
has been contacted about it.
The doll stands 15 inches high...
The bodies are stuffed with straw,
and the name A.E. Sutton stamped on the foot.
Fire Marshal says the dolls, which sold
for less than a dollar and for usually...
Where's your mother?
I couldn't leave her.
Why'd you mark the calendar
towards this date?
Look, I want this to happen.
I don't want to see it happen.
It'll be over in a few minutes.
I've got things to do.
Can't see the hanging from here.
Just hear it.
Hear it?
Yeah, hanging sounds
almost as bad as it looks.
Trap door bangs open.
Do you want something to eat?
Probably a few fellows
watching will give a...
- Daddy?
- ...hoop or a holler.
Trouble?
I got there too late, they told me.
I need help with your mother.
- Something wrong?
- Franny?
No, it's...
- just that I've never seen a lonesomer town.
- Franny?
Well, it's just that...
Franny!
Not everyone. That calendar there
says someone's been counting the days.
Franny!
Franny!
You will have to take care of this.
Franny!
Me and little Joe found Deuce Martin dead.
- Franny!
- Dead?
Franny! Fran, Fran!
Franny! Franny! Franny! Franny!
What are you doing?
You needed stitches.
Why are you laughing?
Why us?
You let me in.
You've done this before.
Why do you do it?
It feels amazing.
You're gonna kill me, right?
Why would I kill you?
You're my only friend.
I'm gonna take care of you.
What are you doing?
Been eating this kind of food
all the way from Ohio?
We have, sir.
Well, you keep shoveling it out to him,
you're not gonna have any left.
Where are you headed?
We hope to be in Slatersville by week's end.
Heard word of a large fertile valley there.
And God willing,
we hope to buy land and settle in peace.
He won't make any more noise.
Yes, and we work for many years
put all of our money together.
I love you, Daddy.
It is our dream to start a fresh new life.
Hello.
Hello.
I told you what I saw at the trial.
- Sally, you lied.
- Little Joe, no need for that.
You were hurting the lady.
I didn't mean to hurt you, Sally, I'm sorry.
I just wanted you
to tell the truth, that's all.
We're not doing any good here.
Let's go see Barney Ogden.
Ma'am.
So, you live close by?
A few towns over.
Your house is so neat.
Thank you.
Can I get you anything?
I'm okay.
Have you lived here a long time?
My whole life.
Was this your parents' house?
Yes.
Do you live here alone now?
I'm sorry, I'm asking so many questions.
I ask a lot of questions when I'm nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I don't do this very often.
Do what?
Go home with people.
Neither do I.
Okay, so we both have
an excuse to be awkward.
Is this your mother?
Yes.
She's beautiful.
She was.
What was she like?
She was a wonderful mother.
What else?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Come on. Anything.
What did she do?
She was a surgeon in Portugal.
What kind?
Eyes.
When I was little,
we used to do the sections together.
I remember I was fascinated
by how the inside of the body looked.
She always hoped
I would be a surgeon one day.
I dissected a cat once in school.
That sort of stuff always grossed me out.
What happened to her?
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.
Someone killed her.
What?
What about your dad?
I killed him.
No, really.
Really.
What?
You're not serious, are you?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't funny.
So sorry.
No, I'm... it's okay. I...
I should probably think
about heading home soon.
Why? Please don't go.
- I can just call my mom.
- No. No. I'll drive you home.
No, it's okay.
I'll drive you home.
Please don't go. Please don't go.
No, no, it's... it's okay.
- No.
- I... listen, I'm just kind of tired.
- I'm just gonna go.
- Please.
- I'm... I'm just gonna...
- Don't go.
- I'm gonna go, okay?
- Please, stop.
I'm just a little tired, okay?
It's okay, little guy.
He's just... he's a little fussy.
It's okay.
Would you mind putting that
back in his mouth?
Thank you.
Baby.
Don't cry.
So, you're just up this way, right?
Yes.
Okay.
Have a wonderful afternoon, okay?
You think I could just hold Antonio?
I'm sorry. We... we really have to get going.
Please, can I hold him just for a little bit?
- Okay?
- Okay, okay, just do it quick.
A quick one. Yes, of course.
Of course we can.
- Hey, baby.
- Come on, little guy.
Yeah, we made a new friend today.
Look at that. She's just gonna hold you.
It's okay. It's okay.
Okay, so you just wanna hold his head up.
- Hi, baby. Hello, baby.
- Good job. He likes his little...
His little...
What are you... saying?
What are you doing? No.
No! Stop! Please, don't hurt him, please!
Don't hurt my baby! Stop!
Please don't hurt him!
Please, don't hurt him, please!
Hey, baby.
- Don't scream.
- Please don't do this.
- Please give him back to me.
- Baby.
Please get away from him.
Mr. Loren...
I advise you to call this party off now.
The ghosts are already moving
and that's a bad sign.
Let me apologize for my wife,
she'll join us later.
- What will you have?
- Scotch Ann.
- Doctor?
- I'll have the same.
Now, before the party begins,
let's go over the details.
The caretakers will leave at midnight
locking us in here
until they come back in the morning.
Once the door is locked, there's no way out.
The windows have bars
that a jail would be proud of.
- Antonio?
- Now, the only door to the outside...
There's no electricity, no phone.
No one within miles.
So, no way to call for help.
It's only a dream. It's only a dream.
It's only a dream. It's only a dream.
What?
Did you go in the barn?
I told you to never go in the barn.
Baby! Baby, wake up. Baby.
- What's wrong?
- You know how much I love you, right?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong.
Whatever you learn, don't let it change
how I feel about me, okay?
- Who's here?
- Open up. Open up, it's the police.
Police!
Come on, come on, baby. Come on. You're fast.
- Come on. Come on.
- Clear! Get them clear. Backup, upstairs.
- Upstairs.
- Second floor. Let's go.
Mommy!
