I can't stand it any more
I love you
I love you
We have to do it
I love you
I won't leave you, Julien
You know I'll be there. with you
I love you.
Without your voice
I'd be lost in silence
Lift to the scaffold
What time is it?
Seven
Kiss me
I'll be waiting on the terrace
of our cafe as usual
When it's done, you'll come in your big car
and stop opposite. I'll get in next to you,
And we'll be free, Julien
I'm waiting, just for you
In half an hour, Julien
Florence...
Genevieve
Genevieve
Will you be staying for a while?
I know it's Saturday, but I have
work to finish
Carala Ltd. Good evening.
One moment
You know I'm always the last to leave
Don't disturb me on any account
Hello, Monsieur Carala?
A call from London
Yes. Very well then
Monsieur Carala's going to Geneva
any minute. He can't talk
Really, Tavernier, late again
In Indo-China, it didn't matter
if you missed a battle or two
But this is serious business now,
Not fantasy.
I'm expected in Geneva
Here's the document
It's funny, all the same
You're an admirable man, Tavernier,
like a real friend to me
A very interesting document
I knew my company needed a hero
A retired hero
Our business needs angels.
Commandos are angels
This is good. Geological surveys,
details of drilling...
Our counter-intelligence is good
They know as much as the Americans
A pipeline project
This is a mistake
A pipeline to Morocco would be
longer but safer
What sort of joke is this?
Not a joke?
What is it then? Money?
I'm not afraid of you
I'm used to people hating me
Besides, you've no guts.
For war, yes, but not for big things
You laugh at wars.
But you live off them
Indo-China made you millions
And now Algeria
Respect wars, Monsieur Carala.
They're your private income
What's that gun?
Who gave you my gun?
You can write lots of nonsense now
The Captain's fallen asleep
He said not to disturb him
We can't stay all night
I'll call him then
Be fun to put my finger in
Tavernier's not answering
Yes, Monsieur. I'm sorry
Captain...
Good evening, Maurice
- Are we the last?
- Yes
See Monsieur Carala leave?
No, I was checking the floors
He'll be gone by now, his train
left at quarter to
The boss is strange, isn't he?
Leaves without telling anyone
He steals out, like a thief
When is he back?
We never know. Last time he bought
oil tankers, he went to Naples
This time, who knows?
Naples is an unhealthy place
I'm not a Captain now
- Goodnight, Genevieve
- Have a nice weekend
I'm not exaggerating, Louis,
it's really fantastic
Think about it, it's true.
You can't feel it as I do
OK, you're cleverer than me,
you read, you've got ideas
Your jacket's ridiculous
Look. Monsieur Tavernier
He always parks on yellow lines,
he laughs at tickets and cops
Got real class, hasn't he?
He was in Indo-China,
North Africa, then in the Legion
Now he's in business. This month
he has bought lots of flowers
Look. Press a button, and off
It's the life I dream of
It's old hat
That's clever
Florence is waiting
My engine's running
If he see you, he'll go mad
I doubt it
You don't know him.
He's got heaps of medals and scars
Good for him
Yes. It's more than you'd do
Let's eat, I'm starving
You always do something
to ruin our evenings
Get in, will you?
You get out. If you crash,
I'm not looking after you
Louis, everyone's watching
It's got wipers
Careful!
Julien
Good evening, Madame.
Still happy with the baby?
A Dauphine's a baby, after all
Yes, very happy, thank you
A perfect car for a Parisian lady
Happy... very happy
That fool will babble on
Julien with that young girl
Why?
Yes... it was the little florist
It can't be, it'd be too cheap
He was scared, he didn't shoot
Coward! Julien's a coward
He's afraid of happiness
My compliments, Madame Carala
Where are we going?
The motorway
He'll be furious
Think he'll call the police?
Who cares?
Put it back in the same place,
or it'll be mean
We've already ruined his weekend
Djelfa Oilfield, know it?
Pass his gloves
Look, a mini-camera
It's amazing, a friend of mine
got one in Germany almost the same
Pass his raincoat
No fingerprints.
That's not a gun for amateurs
A gun, a camera that spies use,
Djelfa Oilfields...
Your Tavernier's odd, even shady
Maybe he's a secret agent,
he certainly looks like one
What are you doing?
And you, for that matter?
It's late...
Run along home
Seen Monsieur Tavernier?
At lunchtime. Not tonight
Seen Monsieur Tavernier tonight?
No, Madame
Seen Monsieur Tavernier tonight?
No, Madame
He hasn't 'phoned?
No, Madame
Julien
Oh no, not again
Third time down the motorway.
I'm fed up, it's always the same
You like driving, or you don't
A Mercedes. A 305
They're foreign
- Danish...
- No, German
Careful, Louis
145 kph flat out... this is a tank.
Your Tavernier can keep it!
Quick, you can catch him
My first accident with this car.
That deserves a drink
Horst Bencker, from Munich
My husband, Julien Tavernier
Ah, your honeymoon?
We'll put the champagne on ice
Let's stay the night. It's a motel
They have chalets, with garages
Are you mad?
I stole a scooter last week,
they may be looking for me
Not here.
Besides, I told them
your name's Tavernier
What about the Germans?
They're just Germans
You do it then. I can't go in
I'll sign Monsieur and Madame
Julien Tavernier
Are you staying here?
Yes
No, I haven't seen them again.
Nor the other young man
But if you like, I could...
I understand
M. and Mme. Julien Tavernier
No. 11, next to M. and Mme. Bencker
The engine's amazing
Why does it slope?
Takes less room
Where are the carburettors?
There aren't any
My dear Tavernier, be my guest
No, I can't accept
I insist. I love sport
and I see you're a very good driver
Besides, we nearly killed each other.
So please, come in
My favorite champagne. We couldn't
get this during the Occupation
Not for him
Pity, if I'd have known you
didn't like champagne...
No offence
but my generation cares about
more important things
The Occupation, Indo-China, Algeria
Bravo! To Europe!
To Europe!
It was man to man combat.
With knives
Filthy climate, mosquitoes, tigers
Germans...
What Germans?
Yes, in Indo-China, Tavernier
You must have seen Germans?
No, never
In the Foreign Legion?
Ah, of course. They're good soldiers
You flatter me
No, I mean it
I was with some ex-soldiers...
of Rommel
I've one the same
but I forgot it
at a friend's in Antwerp
Is it easy to develop?
Yes, you can do it anywere.
Even here in the motel
There are still three photos
Germans don't like war
We'd never guess
You talk like the old generation
of Frenchmen
We really travel for business
Travelling in uniform
gets you noticed
Louis...
er, Julien
You see, my dear Tavernier
War is not only horrible,
it's a waste of time
One the Prussians have had
But I'm not Prussian,
I actually come from...
Oh, the ladies have gone out
Let's get some air
"Nature is a source of deep
consolation" as Goethe said
I don't need consoling
He didn't only mean you
Strong, eh?
Not at all
Don't worry about the ladies
You should take underwater photos
I've a charming cousin,
Ludwig von Malhausen.
Do you know him?
But you must have seen him in Capri,
he's always there
What did I tell you?
Ah, my dear Tavernier
...whose name isn't Tavernier,
and who's never been a soldier
...don't make yourself ill
And don't let the thunder get you either.
It was a nice joke of yours
I think we'd better go in
They'll get drenched
I take your queen
Come to bed
Julien Tavernier
Julien...
I have looked for you everywhere
Have you seen Julien tonight?
No, not tonight
I lost you tonight, Julien
I should have left you alone...
...not kissed you,
or caressed your face
I don't care if you didn't kill Simon
if you were afraid
But you must come back to me
Be there, alive, beside me
Julien, you must
You must
Don't I know you?
Christian Subervie
A pal of Julien's,
we met one night
I remember, vaguely.
You'd been drinking
No doubt. Julien's a bad influence.
We met in Algiers
I wasn't an officer like him.
I was in refrigerators
He must have some floozie,
his pals never see him
Yvonne, another drink
Can I have a Royale?
No, I'm with a friend of Julien's
I saw Julien
A Royale for her
He must have a floozie
He was in a car, didn't even look
Tonight?
No. Maybe last week
Mind you, he couldn't care less about girls
Julien's nice
Wake up, we're leaving
- Are we doing a flit?
- Before the storm stops
I'm ready
Louis, you're crazy
Shut up, get in.
Serves the bastards right
We have to cover our tracks
Problems with the gearbox?
Looking for first gear? I hid it
Hands up
No closer
We must get out of here
Stop after the bridge, we'll walk
Louis, the raincoat
I'm beat
You were scared, tell them that
I wasn't, but he didn't stop
If only the gun hadn't been
in the car, dangerous things
Think they're both dead?
Surgery does miracles now,
even on hearts
We've still a few hours...
What will they do to us?
They'll separate us
you with the men,
me with the women
I can't bear the thought
We'll only be together
on the front pages
The readers will understand
Understand what?
Everything
They can't execute you
I'm old enough
I won't let them hurt you
We won't leave each other
If we had cash, we could go to
South America
Our photo on the front page;
"The tragic lovers"
You'll be OK. You did nothing.
My life is over tomorrow
No, I'll stay with you
You don't know what cops are like
We'll be stronger than them
We'll die together
When?
Now. I have something
You don't feel a thing.
You go straight to sleep
People will talk about us
We'll be famous
The music will keep playing,
but we'll be dead
We have to, I know we have to
A whole night, like a lunatic,
looking for Julien, finding nothing
My feet are cold
Hey, it's full of cops
Florence Carala
Like Carala?
There aren't that many.
He's my husband
You're Madame Simon Carala?
Don't you approve?
Drop it
Why were you at the Madeleine at 5 a.m. ?
Going to Mass
With him?
Forgive me, Madame Carala,
I'm sorry, it's a mistake
Stop, you don't have to
crawl like that
Carala's only an arms dealer,
and a cretin
Shut up, you...
I'll deal with him
Phone my house to send the chauffeur
Are you used to police stations?
Sometimes, in the morning
Julien too?
Well, he's my pal
You should see how he treats them
Perhaps he's at another station
Right. Let's look
Just stay there
He'll be thirsty
He'll wait
That's not nice
Inspector Cherier, Crime Squad
I hope your husband won't hold
this silly mistake against us
He's in Switzerland,
he doesn't have to know
Of course, Madame, and we won't
be registering you here
I should hope not! My husband
often lunches with the Minister
Of course, Madame, he must have
lots of lunches in his business
By the way...
What?
Doesn't he have a colleague called
Tavernier?
I think so
You see... perhaps you know him?
I've seen him once or twice
Could you perhaps tell me
when you saw him last?
Funnily enough, I saw him
last night in his car
In the Boulevard Haussmann
What time?
Seven o'clock...
No, it was before seven
Of course. Was he alone?
He had a young girl with him
Why "of course", Inspector?
You have just unwittingly rendered
the law a great service
We're looking for Tavernier
He's accused of murder
Murdering whom?
His boss will be sorry to hear
he killed two German tourists
Good for him
We found his raincoat, his car, his gun
He was with a girl.
That makes your evidence
extremely interesting
We hope Madame will forgive my mistake
Has my husband 'phoned?
No, Madame
Drop Monsieur Subervie,
then get my car out for me
I'm a fright...
or am I mad?
You're before French law
I'm here, on the very morning of the crime.
A Sunday, no less
You must tell the whole truth
There was a storm, we were upset,
we couldn't sleep
I saw the silhouettes
Hard to say
Did you see him or not?
It's him, bound to be
Next
Actually, the suspect
didn't come into reception
But I did see the unfortunate victims
And the delinquent who signed in,
if you've a photo of her...?
You'll find I've always
co-operated with the law
Next
Look here, Inspector
I'm not the Inspector, I'm the
Deputy Public Prosecutor
Identity papers?
I must object to this invasion.
My private life is public
I'm Jacqueline Mauclair
So what?
Journalist are insatiable.
OK, send them in
Gentlemen, remember that I was
a teacher before I became a lawyer
This affair, like a Racine tragedy,
will be over in 24 hours
The crime committed one night
Murderer identified next morning
And captured that same night,
at the latest
The suspect is Julien Tavernier,
ex-army officer and parachutist
His car, gun, and raincoat
are in our possession
Witnesses have identified
him and his accomplice
There can be several motives
for this senseless act
Tavernier was a drunkard, a hothead,
with a reputation for brawing
But I feel that isn't a complete
explanation
The Germans' chalet was next to
Tavernier's, easy for certain things
And the victim, Madame Bencher,
was very young and very beautiful
Can we see the body?
Out of the question
The case will be closed when
the murderer confesses
The law acted like lightning, not
a second was wasted finding out
Ah, Cherier, here you are
That will be all, gentlemen
Here he is, the murderer
All this fuss over a lousy crime
You think you own the place
Captain Tavernier, a murderer?
Never
What will you police think of next?
Monsieur Carala doesn't like
people poking around
The cops have taken it
It's a shame
It really is a sorry sight
Where's that man gone now?
That's odd, he never closes it
Good thing you came.
There's a corpse. The boss
Monsieur Carala. Looks like suicide
Madame Carala, please
Asleep?
No, let her sleep
I'll call back
I'm hungry
bring me coffee
and croissants on the terrace
It's the same man, Papa
Look, it's the same man
It's the same man, Papa
Now, let's try and get a few things clear
You left the Carala building at 7:30, we know that
The doorman and telephonist saw you
Before that you were in your office
Then you got your car,
and drove around
- I didn't
- You were seen
Someone made a mistake,
or you're lying
I see. All right
You want to play? We'll play
You recognize this gun
and this raincoat
- I left them in my car
- Yes, of course
How many bullets were left?
Must have been full
You left that lying around too
You're very careless, Tavernier
What exactly was your job
in Carala's company?
I went to see people,
important people
I told them about Monsieur Carala,
and watched them all crawl
I've news for you.
We just call him Carala
Can't be everywhere at once
So you liked working for Carala?
I mean, Monsieur Carala
That's my business. Besides...
I'd had other jobs before
What about the motel at Trappes?
- Never been there
- You were seen
Is it my fault? I could've been seen
in East Berlin or Casablanca
Where were you?
I don't know
I got drunk
At the motel
In Paris. I walked around
That's all well and good,
but there's a slight problem
The witnesses at the motel
may be wrong, OK
But answer me this little riddle
Do you know a lady, an elegant lady,
a bit of a night owl?
Who? My accomplice at the motel?
I'd certainly like to meet her
No, I was thinking of...
Madame Carala
- I hardly know her
- But that's perfect
She says she saw you in the late
afternoon in your car with a girl
You hardly know her,
and she hardly knows you
Yet she recognized you.
The witnesses agree for once
It's not true, it's impossible.
I was somewhere else
Are you sure?
Let me sleep
We'd like to let you, believe me.
Carry on: version six
Where were you on Saturday night?
I don't know
So, have you decided to talk?
If I said where I spent the night...
Any alibi will do: women, little girls,
waiters, friends, irate husbands
But not lifts
Frankly, that's ridiculous
Ridiculous, eh?
Yes, it's pretty pathetic
You're off to a bad start
Facts and witnesses agree.
The lift story won't impress the jury
Yes, not a good start
Bad news
Carala's been found dead
in his office
Suicide. Any comment?
Let me sleep
It'll be interesting to get
Madame Carala's reaction
We've got off the point
Where were you on Saturday night?
His suicide has absolutely
shattered me
Our president, your husband,
was so dynamic
Thank you for all your help
Not at all
I'll look after your interests in the company
we have to consider them
And that horrible murder in Trappes.
The very same night!
Odd bloke Tavernier. Let's hope
they find him and his accomplice
It's bad for tourism
I'll walk you to your car
No, you're busy. Goodbye
I'll save you, Julien
Madame, an azalea?
Is your sales girl here?
Veronique? Not on Sundays
her boyfriend, cinema, dancing
Veronique. Where does she live?
A little room in the XVth.
Has she done something silly?
Where exactly?
Boulevard de Grenelle, 55
I recommend this, pink ones are rare
It's quite delightful
Mademoiselle Veronique?
On the right, at the end
Who are you? What do you want?
You took too much.
Mistakes save lives
You're kids, you don't know about
phenobarbitone
Leave us alone
You stole the car.
Then you killed the Germans
They saw her, it's in the papers
I need you alive
To prove this is untrue, all lies!
Don't do anything silly
It's a load of rubbish.
It's not my photo
No, it's Monsieur Tavernier
So... it's not me!
It's him... it's Tavernier
That old bag was lying
Vero... we're safe
That's why we didn't die
You must hide, they saw you
The photos, Louis
It's his photo in the papers
The Germans' photos
Which photos?
The ones we took in the motel.
Here, I have the ticket
Shit!
Shit!
I'll go
It's the only proof, Vero
The spare key is in the drawer
He rents a room
55 Boulevard de Grenelle, Room 22
He's taken phenobarbitone
He's the motel murderer, he told me
It's the truth
Does it matter who I am?
It's your bad luck if you're
so stupid
You the photographer?
There you are
You too? Please come in
There's something else
There are always various photos in a camera
Tavernier didn't kill the Germans
But he killed your husband
You were his accomplice, maybe more
Never leave photos around
You should thank me really
He had no motive for the Germans.
He'd have got a death sentence
For your husband, he'll get ten years
Ten years
He'll only do five
But you, Madame Carala...
The jury won't be lenient with you
And they'll be right
Twenty years, no more age,
no more days
I'll go to sleep
I'll wake up... alone
Ten years, twenty years
No pity. I had no pity
But I know I loved you
I didn't do it for myself
I'll soon be old
There we're together
There, somewhere, together
They can't separate us
