   Stop Right There
   And Surrender Your Weapon.

Ladies And Gentlemen,
That Concludes The Film Portion
Of Our Presentation.
                I'm Sure You All
                Have Questions.
   So Let Me Introduce You
   To The Head Of Development
       For Secure-Tronics
       Unlimited--
        Dr. Stan Simon.
      Thank You Very Much.
 Before I Open The Floor,
 I'd Like You All To Meet
 Your Brand-New Security Team--
 <I>The Protector 101</I>
 <I>Series Robots.</I>
One Week From Tonight
At Closing,
 <I>The Protectors Will Begin</I>
 <I>Their Patrol Of The Mall.</I>
            Paul, They Look Like
            The Three Stooges.
Each Assigned To One Of
The Three Upper Shopping Levels.
I Don't Know, Mary,
The One In The Middle Has
An Unpleasantly Ethnic Quality.
         Now, Are There
         Any Questions?
            Yes, Dr. Carrington.
So What Do Your Machines There
Do Besides Kill Criminals?
    First Of All,
    The Protectors Do Not Kill.
               I Wonder If They
               Kill Cockroaches.
They Could Probably
Be Programmed To.
And Merely Detain Intruders
Until The Computer,
 <I>Located On The Roof,</I>
 <I>Can Patch Into</I>
 <I>The Mall Phone System</I>
And Send The Alarm
To The Police.
I Don't Know.
That Guy Looked
Awfully Dead To Me.
     Just Neutralized.
     Protectors Can Achieve
     This Function
      In A Number Of Ways.
  At Close Range, Sleep Darts
  Fired From Here And Here
    Can Knock A Man Out
    In Less Than 30 Seconds.
  However, The Likelihood
  Of An Intruder Gaining Entry
  Is Greatly Minimized
  By The Steel Security Doors
 <I>Which Are Time-Locked</I>
 <I>From Midnight 'til Dawn.</I>
   Um, They Seem So Violent.
 If They're Called Protectors,
 What Do They Protect?
           <I>Plenty. For Starters,</I>
           <I>As Seen In The Film,</I>
 The Protectors Do Their Work
 In The Mall Proper,
 Not In The Stores Themselves.
 <I>Maybe We Could Use One</I>
 <I>At The Restaurant--</I>
Get Rid Of People
We Don't Like.
    For Instance, Lasers
    Positioned Here
    Can Cut Through
    Any Sort Of Debris.
Well, That's All Very Well
And Good, But What About
Those Who Work Late?
How Can Your... Things There
Distinguish Between The Good
Guys And The Bad Guys?
    That's Very Simple.
    Watch.
    This Is Simon.
    <I>Bring Number One On-Line.</I>
            [Whirrs]
             Whoa!
                       Wow!
          [Murmuring]
 May I See Your
 Identification Badge, Please?
It's Scanning.
They Remind Me Of Your Mother.
It's The Laser Eyes.
 <I>[Robot]</I>
 <I>Thank You.</I>
 <I>Have A Nice Day.</I>
                 Same To You.
                 There. You See?
The System Is
Absolutely Foolproof.
    Now, Everyone Connected
    With The Mall Has Been
    Issued An I.D. Badge
 <I>So That When The Mechanism</I>
 <I>Goes On-Line,</I>
The Protectors Will Make
Park Plaza The Safest Mall
In The State.
 <I>Trust Me.</I>
 <I>Absolutely Nothing</I>
 <I>Can Go Wrong.</I>
                     Ow!
Are You All Right?
Coffee?
            <I>Come On, Sweetheart!</I>
        Give It To Me!
        What Do You Got?
        <I>Andiamo!</I>
   Can I Get Two
   Uncle Luigi Bellybusters,
   A Double Anchovy Pizza
And An Order
Of Garlic Logs?
Gross. What Mojave
Brain Ordered That?
          Guy Over There.
Oh, God. I Should've Known.
That Orca Beaches
Here Every Night.
Always Trying To Snag Some Skin.
Play It Safe, Alison.
Serve At Arm's Length,
If You Get My Drift.
          <I>Thanks For The Advice.</I>
           Yeah.
[Screams]
             Shit!
       <I>Oh, Honey, You</I>
       <I>Breakin' My Heart.</I>

          <I>Look, Alison, In About</I>
          <I>An Hour And A Half...</I>
     We Bail This Barbecue And
     It's Good Times To The Max.
             You've Got To Show.
Suzie, You've Got
A One-Track Mind.
I Already Told You,
I Don't Know Anybody.
            Yeah, But You Will
            After Tonight.
 <I>That's What I'm Afraid Of.</I>
Would I Set You Up With
A Slime Dog Or Something?
    No Way, "Babe."
     [Together]
     It Is Babe, Isn't It?
    Come On, Come On!
    Take It While It's Hot.
                 <I>Girls, Come On!</I>
 Yeah, All Right,
 All Right.

 <I>Forget About Your Uncle Awhile.</I>
 <I>This Is Gonna Work, Okay?</I>
             Ferdy, You Can't
             Back Out On Us Now.
    Okay, Okay, Let's Party.
All Right.
    First I Gotta Find
    Mrs. Flanagan's Fuchsia
You Find
Mrs. Flanagan's Fuchsia.
You, You Hold Down
The Fort.
             I Will.
I'm Gonna Go Find Leslie.
       [Chuckles]
       I'm Sure You Will.
Quack, Quack.
          Greg, I--
 <I>Ferdy,</I>
        Don't Worry.
     I Can't Find The Fuchsia.
     Ah, Fuck The Fuchsia.
     It's Friday.
   Tell The Old Bag To Wait.
 <I>[Loud Thunderclap]</I>
Okay. Give It A Try.

Okay, Butch.
You Know I Can't Resist It
When You Get Tough.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Just Crank It When I Tell Ya.
            Well? We're Waiting.
Just A Sec, Huh?
All Right. Hit It.
                 <I>[Engine Starts]</I>
     Always The First Time.
I Don't Want To Hear It,
Not Another Word.
            Me? No Way.
       I Covered This Whole Deal
       When I Said, "For Better
       Or Worse," Remember?
Of Course I Remember.
Who Could Forget
That 40-Weight Stain
Right There On Your Chest?
       Should've Been
       "For Better Or Weird."
       And Speaking About Weird,
       What About This
       Furniture Store--
Come On, Walden.
Indulge Me.
We Haven't Had Any Fun Since
We Sunk All Our Wedding Money
Into The Business.

I Wish I Had It That Easy.
My Parents Still Think
I'm A Kid.
       Why Do I Have The Feeling
       I'm Gonna Regret This
       In The Morning?
Look, Alison,
You've Had Yourself
A Very Rough First Week.
You Owe Yourself
A Little Blowout.
Come On.
It'll Be Fun.
         Okay, Just So Long
         As I Don't Have To
         Look At Any More Pizza.
You Won't.
I Promise. Oh, Great!
This Is Gonna Be Wonderful.
You Won't Regret This.

Oh, No.
This Is A Terrible Color.
Give Me Another Color.
       What If He's Not My Type?
Oh, Yeah, That's It--
Luscious Lust.
            Are You Listening?
            What Are We Gonna Do
            All Night?
Will You Stop Worrying?
Like I Said, He's Got--
       [Together]
       A Great Personality!
That's Right!
   He Does.
   You're Going To Love Him.
   Trust Me On This.
Hey, Babe.
         It Is "Babe," Isn't It?
[Laughing]
Let Me See. Okay.
        What? What, What?
You Look Good. Yeah.
              Are You Sure?
               Really?
        Yeah!

Marty, I'm Sorry I'm Late,

 I'm Not In The Mood For Games.
     <I>[Angry Muttering On Tv]</I>
What Is It With
Those Two Anyway?
       Personally, I Can't
       Figure It Out. All They
       Do Is Have Sex And Fight.
Like Most Couples.
                 Yeah.
Look, We've Got About 15 Minutes
Before The Whole Place Locks Up.
    Ferdy.
                     Yeah?
    Thanks.
    Mike?
        Mike?
 <I>Mike?</I>
           Damn You!
  Brennan, 'You Don't
  Come Out Now, Don't Bother.
      All Right, Wake Up.
            Wake Up!
        I Said Wake Up!
       That's It! I Don't
       Need This Crap!

        Good. All Right.
 <I>[Greg]</I>
 <I>This Isn't Gonna</I>
 <I>Hold Them Very Long.</I>
 <I>You Got Any Better Ideas?</I>
    <I>What About The Fire Exit?</I>
 <I>[Greg] All That's Gonna Do</I>
 <I>Is Put Us Back In The Middle</I>
 <I>Of Those Machines.</I>
    Beats Being Trapped In Here.
    Who Knows What They're
    Planning Right Now?
 <I>Linda's Right. We've</I>
 <I>Gotta Get Out Somewhere We</I>
 <I>Can Run And Get Some Weapons.</I>
 <I>[Mechanical Doors</I>
 <I>Slamming Shut]</I>
         What Was That?
    That's The Sound Of Us Being
    Locked In Here All Night.
           The Security Doors
           Don't Open 'Til 6:00.
          Oh, No! We're Never
          Gonna Get Out Of Here!
     Yes, We Are.
         The Phone's Dead.
             <I>The Computer Must</I>
             <I>Have Taken Control.</I>
       [Whimpering]
           Hey, What About That?
         The Air Duct.
          <I>We Take It Down</I>
          <I>To The Parking Levels,</I>
          <I>We're Outta Here.</I>
        Let's Go For It!
          [Whimpering]
           Go, Baby!
       [Whirring Noises]
       [Whirring Noises]
         [Screaming]
         What Was That?
Go, Suzie. Go.
  I'm Right Behind You.
           As Usual.
        Prepare For Detonation.
 Proceeding To Alternate Access.
   Come On, Alison, You're Next.
      Come On, Keep Going.
      Keep Going!
    [Yelling And Screaming]
I Thought This Was
An Air Conditioning Duct.
               Except The Heat's
               Been Turned On.
In The Middle Of Summer?
They Know We're In Here.
They're Trying To French-Fry Us.
Come On, Suze.
You Know Who Gives You Twice
As Much Heat At The Restaurant.
    [Grunting]
           [Panting]
            Damn!
Wrap Whatever You Can
Around Your Hands.
        [Whimpering]
I Can't Stand This Anymore.
I Gotta Get Outta Here.
I Gotta Get Outta Here!
[Sobbing]
        Come On, Suze.
        Hang In There.
    [Sobbing Continues]
                       What Now?
Find Some Way Outta Here.
   We're Gonna Have To Defend
   Ourselves. This Place Got
   A Sporting Goods Store?
          [Together]
          Peckinpah's.
          Let's Go.
 <I>How Are We Gonna Get In?</I>
 <I>Don't Worry.</I>
 <I>I Got The Keys.</I>
           Jesus.
     Ferdy, Propane Tanks.
     Grab The Biggest.
                      All Right.
    Let's See.
             <I>What About Shells?</I>
 Twelve Gauge.
               Here.
         Great. Thanks.
And Some 223's.
Let's Go Send Those Fuckers
A Rambo-Gram.
You Sure You Know
How To Shoot That?
     Yeah. I Saw
     <I>Dirty Harry</I> 24 Times.
            All Set?
    Yeah.
             Good.
One Of Them Ought
To Have Heard That.
   Dead Man Could've Heard That.
    Hey, Fellas,
    We Got Company.
That Didn't Take Very Long.
 <I>Steady. Go For It.</I>
        Ferdy, Now!
 <I>[Whimpering]</I>
 <I>I Gotta Find Greg.</I>
          He Needs Me.
       Let Me Outta Here!
              Suzie, Please.
   <I>The Guys Told Us To Go Down</I>
   <I>To The Parking Levels.</I>
           [Whirring]
       <I>Come On, Kiddo.</I>
       <I>Greg Wouldn't Want You</I>
       <I>To Give Up Now.</I>
    Oh, Go To Hell, Linda!
 <I>You Do What You Want,</I>
 <I>But I'm Getting Out Of Here.</I>
     <I>Suzie, Stop It! Please.</I>
     <I>Greg Needs Me.</I>
     <I>I Know He Does.</I>
           [Burbling]
Jesus.
               What's That?
          Robot Blood.
            Not Too Shabby, Huh?
We're Not Finished Yet.
We Still Got
Two More Of These Suckers
Around Here Someplace.
    We Gotta Get More Tanks.
          What Are You Thinking?
     I Got An Idea.
                Really, This Is
                Not A Good Idea.
  Bullshit!
      Greg Could Be Hurt.
      They All Could.
 <I>I'm Gonna Find Them.</I>
I've Got To.
What Do You Think?
                     Well,
      If We Gotta Go,
      Let's Not Go Empty-Handed.
              [Loud Whirring]
Shit. I Didn't Think
They'd Work.
          Never Hurts To Try.
      I Guess Not.
Give Me A Hand.
Let's Pry This Baby Open.
   Come On.
        You Know, I Gotta Worry.
    Report From The Front:
    Ferdy's Gotta Worry.
      Yeah. What If These Things
      Can Read Our Minds?
They're Gonna Be Awful Mad
When They Get To Me.
    All Right.
       Come On. Let's Go.
        Give Me The Gun.
                Right.
    Take The Cap Off
    And Stuff The Cloth In.
            That's It?
That's It.
Light It And Throw It.
    You Sound Like
    You've Done This Before.
 <I>Regular Or Unleaded,</I>
 <I>It Gets The Job Done.</I>
           [Whirring]
   Protector 1 Back On-Line.
   Hey, Guys, How's It Goin'?
Almost Done, Ferdy.
You Think Mike
Got Out All Right?
        For His Sake, I Hope So.
      Right Now, I'm More
      Concerned About The Girls.
You And Me Both.
Hey, I Almost Forgot.
How Much Do I Owe You
For The Beer?
          Forget It, Man.
          If We Get Out Of Here,
          You Owe Me A Six-Pack.
       Just Make Sure That Those
       Cords Are Good And Tight.
Are You Sure
This Is Gonna Work?
       With Those Things,
       I'm Not Sure Of Anything.
Ferdy, How's
The Panel Coming?
         The Doors Work.
         I Bypassed The Circuit.
       But Forget About Going Up
       Or Down. It's Controlled
       By The Computer.
Do You Hear
Anything Unusual?
      Only My Heart Beat.

       Tell Me One Thing,
       Though, Huh?
         Why Did You Leave
         The Air Shaft?
          I Mean, You Were
          Safe There.
         You Were Safe.
        Suzie Thought
        You Were In Trouble.
        She Just Wanted To Help.
   I'm Telling You
   You Should've Kept Her There.
She Told You What Happened.
Why Don't You Just
Leave Her Alone?
              Shut Up.
   You Just Shut The Fuck Up!
                Hey.
                Do You Guys Mind
                Keeping It Down?
 <I>There's Another One</I>
 <I>Of Those Things Out There,</I>
And You're Gonna
Bring It Right To Us.
There's Another One?
         Why Haven't We Seen It?
                            <I>Why?</I>
           I'll Tell You Why.
       'Cause The Fucker's
       Out There Waiting For Us.
            He's Waiting To Pick
            Us Off One By One!
       <I>But I Got News For You.</I>
        He Ain't Getting Me.
Greg, You're
Not Thinking, Man.
We Got Destroyed
By Staying Together.
       And A Lot Of Good
       That Did Suzie, Right?
Wait. Wait.
I Got An Idea.
The Master Computer Is
Somewhere On The Third Level.
We Shut It Down,
It Shuts The Robots Down.
Well?
                       [Panting]
    It's Worth A Try.

        Hold It, Ferdy.
        They Could Be Out There.
   At Least We're Safe Here
   For The Moment.
Yeah, For The Moment.
Those Things Can Go
Anywhere They Want.
 Maybe We'll All Stand
 A Better Chance If We Split Up.
    Are You Kidding?
The Moment Any One Of Us
Go Out There, We're Dead Meat,

Will You Stop It!
 <I>Will You Just Stop It!</I>

     Yeah, And It Won't Be Long
     Before It Comes Our Way.
     We've Gotta Get Outta Here.
Not So Fast. One Of Them
Could've Doubled Back. We Could
Get Picked Off Out There.
   Look, If Those Things
   Want Some Target Practice,
     Why Don't We Give 'Em
     Some Targets?

We'll Never Find It.
Okay, You Try Over There,
And I'll Try Over Here.
       I Don't Want To Split Up.
What Can Happen?
                You Want A List?
We're Wasting Time.
