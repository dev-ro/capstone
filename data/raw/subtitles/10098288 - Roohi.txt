Ready? Camera rolling.
Action...
How's it?
What are you guys shooting?
Hello, sir. Which country?
Baagadpur.
A small town on the outskirts
of the industrial city of Mujeerabad.
For this story, my contact
put me in touch with two reporters
who work for the local newspaper.
Mujeerabadi Zalzala!
Guys, camera!
Hello.
My name is Bhawra Pandey.
Civic and Crime reporter,
Mujeerabadi Zalzala.
I like Kim Kardashian and...
This is...
Stop gawping and say something.
Myself Kattanni.
Writer, horoscope column.
My likes, space technology,
moon, rockets, shuttles...
Okay, okay,
now tell us why we're here.
- Hindi?
- Yeah.
You are one smart cookie, huh!
You see Baagadpur very anti...
Anti...?
Old and anti...
Ahh...antique...ancient.
Yes, ancient.
I'll tell you about an
old tradition of Baagadpur.
Catch Marriage.
- Bride kidnapping.
- Yes.
See...it's like this...
When...
When...boy...
Can I speak in Hindi?
- Of course.
- So the thing is...
When a guy falls
in love with a girl...
...he can get the girl kidnapped
and then marry her.
Catch...marriage.
Let's take him to Babban's place.
Does he have a contract?
Do you want to see the catch marriage?
Do you want to see?
Yes, please.
Come, come.
We'll show you...
During the heydays...
...the groom would kidnap
the bride on his own.
But times are rough nowadays.
So now these are done
on contract basis.
- Contract?
- Contract.
Guniya Shakeel And Co.
Catch Marriage Experts.
See...
- How are you, grandma?
- All good, son.
They work around the clock.
Guys, is this a movie being made?
- Buddy, have you started dieting?
- Yes I did.
Don't point the camera that way.
He'll shoot you in the a**. Stop.
Kattanni.
He is the groom.
Facial for the special day?
He's congratulating you.
That is Pandit bhai and Riyaz bhai.
They do a good job.
Hey, Hollywood, there, not here.
That girl my wife...
To-be. Will-be?
Let's pray they kidnap her.
We're about to witness
a bride kidnapping.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Leave me.
Okay, best friend, goodbye.
This is how they catch
and now marriage...
Catch Marriage.
Let us keep playing.
It's a common routine.
Hello, they got the girl.
Why didn't anybody help her?
It's an age-old tradition that
runs through the veins of Baagadpur.
People say that we're
breaking the law.
But the law isn't above tradition.
It is said that India lives
in several centuries at the same time.
- She is here.
- Leave me.
Where is the camera?
Hi!
Aunty is here. Aunty is here.
Careful. Be gentle.
There you are, my child.
You must be tired.
Drink some water.
Even we'll have some water.
It's okay. We all got
married in a similar fashion.
It's okay.
Oh God!
You better show her, her place mom.
Or I'll beat the living
daylights out of her.
Sisters-in-laws already
got off on the wrong foot.
Aunty seems insecure.
Look at this beautiful necklace.
Made of pure gold. 24-carats.
My son's an engineer.
He earns well.
He'll treat you like a princess.
Just say Yes, dear.
[Regional song continue]
Don't pinch, I won't fall asleep.
You can't fall asleep, son-in-law
or else the witch will show up.
Remember,
she has her eyes on the weddings.
If the groom falls asleep
she will steal your bride away.
Ah! So the singing and dancing
should continue through the night.
[Regional song]
Come and dance.
Come on.
'Remember, she has her eyes
on the weddings.'
'If the groom falls asleep'
she will steal your bride away.'
If you have a mean friend,
life can still sail...
But if your girlfriend is mean,
life is hell.
Wow!
So guys today I'll tell you about
three kinds of lovers
you should stay away from.
The grumbling type...
the failing type... the farting type.
[Ringtone playing on phone]
Boss.
Crime Reporter Bhawra Pandey
reporting, boss.
What crime reporter?
My newspaper is called
Mujeerabadi Zalzala.
Our newspaper has not reported
a single good story since last month
Well...it's wedding season, boss.
So everyone's busy celebrating.
But don't worry, boss.
I have an inkling...
Something big is going to happen.
And when it does, you'll be the
first to get the breaking news, boss.
That's why I am going to the city.
Bravo.
Is your sidekick with you?
Yes, he's here, boss.
I am sending you
a picture on WhatsApp.
Pick her up at 12 o'clock
from the railway hospital.
Pick her up?
Kidnapping?
We've never done it alone, boss.
- Send Pandit and Riyaz.
- Huh...
Pandit-Riyaz.
Boss, if you could
send Pandit and Riyaz...
It's wedding season.
Pandit and Riyaz are taking
on four assignments in a day.
The girl will be alone
with just her father in tow.
Get her straight to the
community wedding hall.
Boss...
New trouble...
Who were you calling a sidekick?
The sidekick.
Sit straight.
I am just changing gears.
Don't get too excited.
Bhawra bro...
Don't you feel our life's meaningless?
I don't feel it, I know it
Everyone in Bagadpur has got someone.
But you and I have
only got each other.
Same old Guniya Boss,
Same old terrace of ours.
You know, Alam Mast is planning
to send cars in space.
The Tesla kind.
And look at us, same old.
Alam. Do you mean Riyaz's uncle?
He's sending cars to space!
Incredible.
Try to dream beyond Bagadpur.
Kattanni, I always dream big.
After reporting a dozen
sensational crime cases
I'll go straight to Noida.
And get my own primetime show.
'Tonight...the world wants to know.'
It'll be awesome.
The American said that the news
channels have gorgeous girls.
Means...
Of course! And you just see
how I will lure them.
My leather boots, my black suit...
...and the James Bond like bowtie...
The girls will have
to fall for me at first sight.
But I'll fall for only one.
The spiritual kind.
She will walk towards me
in slow-motion. My space-beauty.
Only a witch will fall for you.
Space beauty.
She's here.
Who?
Your witch...
I'll distract the father
while you bring the car around.
Then I'll get hold of the girl in
an instant, and...
- and jump in the car immediately...
- Stop. Stop. Get going already.
If she disappears in the crowd
the boss will beat us left,
right, and centre.
Let's go.
[sanskrit shlok chants]
[sanskrit shlok chants]
Star-sign?
Leave us alone. Let us go.
Come.
I'll leave you alone
but what about the one
that's stuck to you like a glue.
Your daughter's stars
are in serious jeopardy.
You behave like a Piscean.
Hear this...
The black hole's gravitational force is
creating severe problems for Pisceans.
Birds might poop on you
and neighbours might coup on you.
Need a fix?
Avoid shampoos
and comb your hair seven
times before leaving from home
and carry the comb in your pocket.
Do this and you will be blessed
from the stars of Milky Way...
...also remember, Lucky Number's 5
Lucky colour purple.
Leave us alone.
Don't ignore this.
Hear me out.
Take this money and leave.
If you squander your wealth like this
then what will you save
for your daughter's wedding?
Where the hell is Bhawra?
You're taking this prediction
too lightly, uncle.
Papa!
- Come on.
- Papa!
Leave her.
Come on.
Bring her in.
Rascal. Leave her.
- Leave my child. Leave.
- Uncle, don't abuse.
- Now you're behaving rudely.
- Papa!
- Papa!
- Bhawra, you also come.
Leave my child.
Come fast.
Stay back.
- Start the car.
- Leave me.
- Hurry up!
- Guys, what are you doing?
Mind your own business, bro.
Stay back!
Somebody stop them.
Speed up. Faster.
Take reverse.
Papa.
You took forever to show up.
She is strong like Dara Singh...
Bump your heads again. Or fate
would get you bitten by a black dog.
Oh no!
Use this chloroform.
Hurry up.
Give it to me.
Done?
Oh, Jesus.
I guess, she knows martial arts.
One for the fate...
Bhawra...
Boss...
Catch Marriage specialists
Bhawra Pandey and
Kattanni reporting, boss.
It's cancelled.
What's cancelled?
The wedding is cancelled.
The inspector accidentally shot the
groom's uncle while doing snake-dance.
Can't we ban this snake-dance
at weddings?
As such most things get banned here.
Gamchu's dad...
Always flirts with some aunty
while doing snake-dance.
Not to forget Chandrabhan...
Tries to slip under any
women's skirt while doing snake-dance.
Boss, you should cancel the
snake-dance, not the wedding.
Shut up!
Now, listen carefully.
The groom's uncle is dead.
The wedding stands cancelled.
It is postponed till his funeral.
Will you stop that bloody lightening?
Take the girl to our
wood factory in Ambiyapur.
Keep her there for a week.
Treat her well.
But boss, that place has
no TV or cellphone network.
We'll even miss the
next episode of Roadies.
And I won't be able to
do my horoscopes out there...
We're not staying
for a week in Ambiyapur.
Boss...
What if we abandon her
outside Sheila Cinema...
...and next week Pandit
and Riyaz can kidn...
- Hello?
- Did he hang up?
- Boss? Hello?
- He hung up.
WhatsApp him.
WhatsApp him now.
Send Pandit and Riyaz...
Ambiyapur.
Stupid uncle gets shot and
we have to go to the graveyard.
What is this place?
Please...
Don't fall. Don't fall.
Here...
- Sit.
- I want to go back to my father.
Sit here.
Careful.
Breaking news.
Tonight... boys peeing
in the open encounter a vampire!
Dracula offers Bloodiest Mary!
Bhawra Pandey, reporting for Zalzala.
How is it?
Go offer your boss
that Bloodiest Mary.
He totally embarrassed me
in front of that lady.
As if you have some reputation
amongst the girls...
I have seen your choices in women.
Some have ugly moles,
some even have moustaches.
Remember watching Avatar.
You fell in love with
the blue creature in it.
She was much better
than your girl in Titanic.
What a selfish woman.
Took the wooden plank
for herself and left Jack to drown.
Jack drowned in her love.
It's called sacrifice.
- Huh, sacrifice...
- Where's the omelette?
Get a plate.
What a rubbish looking omelette
Do you want some
rubbish scrambled eggs?
Roohi.
Roohi...
Roohi, I've got dinner.
Do you like eggs?
Roohi.
Roohi.
Roohi.
Roohi.
Playing hide-n-seek with me.
Don't be scared.
It's just an omelette.
Roohi.
Roohi.
Don't do this please,
boss will mash us up.
Kattanni! Kattanni!
Kattanni! Kattanni! Kattanni!
Come on.
Where are you taking me?
She...
crawling on the wall.
You got scared of a lizard.
Not a lizard.
She's a ghost.
She will eat us, Kattanni.
Why? She doesn't like eggs?
I...I...did get her eggs.
But as I entered,
the room was empty.
Windows were sealed,
so darkness was plenty...
Just then I saw an
image of an evil entity.
Like a devilish humpty dumpty.
The plate slipped from me seeing
that monstrosity...
Seeing the ghost,
I pissed in my pants with severity...
- A ghost?
- Yes.
- The girl is a ghost?
- Yes.
She is.
- Come on, Bhawra.
- No.
- Come on.
- Where are you taking me?
She is very dangerous, Kattanni?
She will devour us.
She looked at me cross-eyed...
- What are you blabbering?
- Don't go. Kattanni. Kattanni!
Don't go, Kattanni.
She is very dangerous.
She looked at me cross-eyed...
Kattanni...
She will devour us.
On the wall...
- Please...
- Take a look first...
See...
Poor thing is just eating eggs.
And she'll devour us?
See, she's even scared of a cockroach.
Nothing happened.
It's just a side-effect of your brain.
You might be hallucinating, Bhawra.
Come, I'll give you a head massage
and you'll feel refreshed.
Come on.
Such a coward.
But...
Hallucination.
Excuse me.
Me?
Food...
Huh?
Food!
More?
I haven't eaten
anything since morning.
Please...
"Take a sneak peek of your loved one."
"O heart, reveal gently to her."
"Don't tell her everything just yet"
"break it to her little by little."
"Take a sneak peek of your loved one."
"O heart, reveal gently to her."
Thank you.
Okay.
She has a lizard like body,
but her diet is like of a dinosaur.
The whole egg basket is over.
What are we going to eat?
We will manage, come on.
Any suspects?
We live in a joint family.
All of us live together.
When I reached home,
they were happy about her.
Happy on hearing about kidnapping?
Unfortunately, yes.
Here's another picture of her.
You got two daughters?
No.
Roohi sometimes looks like this.
Is this a joke?
What kind of a picture is this?
A year ago she was
supposed to get married.
Look...your wife is here.
Isn't she pretty?
Yes, very beautiful.
Do something
different for a change.
You can't always make
the same facial expression.
Come up with a different expression.
Last month, boss was asking...
...why do all corpses of
Baagadpur look familiar?
All the bulls in Baagadpur
look familiar too, like your boss
Does that mean they
are the same bulls?
Don't do this.
I'll come up with something.
I'll need more makeup.
You look more of a corpse
without the makeup.
Such a thankless guy you are.
Hurry up.
"You've tried the
lavish kind before"
"who gives you more tears
than joys, a wrong deal."
"If you want to fall in love"
"then fall for someone
closer to your heart."
"The more careless you were"
"the more careful you must be."
"You don't have to
give all your love at once"
"love me in small instalments."
Kattanni!
Breaking news!
Werewolves create havoc in Mujeerabad!
Zombies run amok.
Ghost...
Zombie...International!
Ghost!
Ghost!
Guess, this was too
terrifying for him.
Come on.
Show me the pic.
- Now show me.
- Yes, boss.
I see...so that's the ghost's pic.
Lady...its a lady ghost.
Lady.
Show it to me, Kattanni.
Too much crossfit has
blurred my eyesight.
Show him.
Show him.
Well...
Boss...
I...I...
I think it's in zoom mode.
Is it, Bhawra?
Bravo. Now zoom out.
Show me where's the ghost!
It's in his mind, boss.
He's hallucinating about the ghost.
What are you blabbering, Kattanni?
Sorry, boss...
Boss... Boss... I could be
hallucinating once but not twice.
I would've clicked a clearer picture
but her reflection jumped
out of the mirror, Boss...
She glared at me like
the movie Terminator...
Boss.
How could you leave her all alone?
Swear on your pecs, boss.
She is a ghost.
I'll pull your souls
out and put it on a leash.
For the last time...
...if you create any more hurdles,
I'll pull your balls out!
Hold on a minute. The boss is busy.
- What?
- Keep this money
and head straight to the wood factory.
- Boss...
- Let's just go, Bhawra.
No...
My balls are stuck.
Mum, will you keep doing
cardio or lift some weights too?
Lost 90 calories,
son, just five more to go.
Why is this happening with me?
Kattanni.
See that, post mortem of a poor deer.
I can see that.
Someone's cast a spell on you.
Spell?
I'll go give a burger to the girl.
Kattanni.
Not burger, but burgers.
Bhawra!
Bhawra, come quickly. Bhawra!
Hurry up.
- What happened?
- She escaped.
What?
Don't you see that? She escaped.
You check in the forest,
I'll look in the factory.
Wait...
Don't be over smart.
Me in the forest,
you in the factory...
What will she do in the
factory if she wants to escape?
Might be waiting for the rain to stop.
She tore through the roof and escaped,
you think rain will scare her!
Stupid.
She's showing some superpowers...
You are right.
She went through the roof.
No, no...
You're absolutely right.
But let's reverse roles.
I'll check in the factory
and you check in the forest.
Okay?
And don't be scared. I am there.
But keep shouting my name.
Bhawra!
Bhawra!
Kattanni!
Roohi!
Bhawra!
Bhawra!
Kattanni!
Wow...
Didn't I tell you she
will be in the factory?
I was chased by the
crows for no reason.
And you both are
playing games here.
I'll play too.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
Catch a tiger by the toe.
If he hollers, let him go...
Tag. You're in.
Toilet.
Toi...
- Toilet?
- Yeah.
Toilet.
Toilet.
I know it now...
...your plan is to scare
Bhawra and give us the slip.
He's been scared since last night.
You must be thinking
we will harm you...
...wait till you find
out how kind we are...
You will be happy to know
why we 'kidnapped' you...
You get it...
Look, I can't tell you clearly...
But since you're a special case...
...try and solve this riddle...
Guess why we brought you here.
Bells will ring aloud...
Fireworks will soar above...
Matches are made in heaven
but what causes that match to happen?
Can you hear me?
Bells will ring aloud...
Fireworks will soar above...
Matches are made in heaven...
...but what causes
that match to happen?
Marriage!
"I am your...Superman."
"Superman."
"You are my...lady."
"Lady..."
"We're in love...already."
"Super...Super...Super...Superman!"
"Super...Super...Super...Superman!"
Glory to Goddess!
What are you doing, Bhawra?
Glory to Goddess!
Glory to Goddess!
Can you see her now?
She's a Lady-Hulk.
Two in one!
Glory to Goddess!
Glory to Goddess!
If I hadn't arrived on time she would've
blown your candles out for good.
You said I was hallucinating.
You got my balls
crushed from boss too...
Now shall I unleash her on you?
Shall I?
Do you still want to take her to pee?!
Glory to Goddess!
Glory to Goddess!
Unchain her.
Careful.
It's alright. Everything's alright.
Poor thing.
Who?
Who else?
Are you blind?
Weren't you too harsh
on her in the forest?
She is a woman, after all.
She isn't a woman.
She is a vicious soul
who has possessed poor Roohi.
Remember, when those old ladies
would get possessed in our town...
...they used to fall
unconscious in seconds...
...but Roohi is gravely possessed.
She's in a lot of trouble, Kattanni.
We must do something.
Right, bro...
We must do something.
What's all this?
Breakfast...
Lunch, dinner.
But I'm a vegetarian.
Don't be so selfish.
The other one prefers
non-vegetarian food.
Abracadabra...
Abracadabra...
What are you doing?
This book has all the spells
to recall 'the other one'
The summoning spell first.
Abracadabra...
For what?
Introduction.
See, we both have met...
...but I couldn't introduce myself
to the other one...
Please cooperate.
Abracadabra...
What is this way...
to introduce yourself?
Ah...ya
I too had doubts on this technique.
Let's try the Hollywood way.
As in Exercise of Imli.
When they hold the cross like this,
the girl transforms.
Power of Holy!
Power of Holy!
You're crying.
- Untie me.
- Wait, I'll untie you.
By the way, you're such a snub.
You turn into a Wonder Woman
in front of Bhawra.
Would he have untied you?
Why did you untie her?
Last night we
had a little trouble, so...
...he tied you up
Sorry.
No need to worry.
Paan?
Not too sweet,
not too spicy,
flavorful, dates, aniseed,
cloves, and nuts.
How polite?
Why don't you offer her booze too?
Offering betel leaf
to a young girl that too at breakfast.
She might get ulcers.
Look at that.
Who is he?
Spitting as if this is some
government office.
Come outside, I'll tell you.
- Why?
- Come out.
No spitting allowed here.
Shut up for God's sake, I'll be back.
Come.
What?
Who on earth is he?
Giving betel leaf for breakfast?
Control your tone.
The father of all exorcists...
...he is an expert witch hunter.
Open your mouth, dear.
Don't be scared.
Be brave.
Do witch hunters look like him?
What are you getting into?
How cliched are you?
Google him
He's exorcized 135 ghosts.
And has got 250
followers on Instagram.
Chew it.
He's known for his
magical concoctions.
As soon as the paan goes in,
the possessing spirit comes out.
His paan is the solution
for Roohi's all problems.
Thanks.
What solution!
What have you done?
She has already spat it out.
No Kattanni, don't disturb him.
Dare you use that concoction?
Why are you getting in the way?
How could you just
spit her out like that?
Calm down, it will be all fine.
No!
I couldn't even meet her properly.
But she has spat her out now...
Now the other one can't come out.
What a terrible concoction!
Sorry...
"Run, run, run like a fire
in the mountain."
"Run, run, run."
"Go, go, go..."
"Run, run, run like a fire
in the mountain."
"Run, run, run."
"She will come after you...
"...she will eat you alive" Run away."
"- Run, run, run.
- You run away."
"- Run, run, run.
- You run away."
If you get scared of her
then who will exorcise the ghost out?
She isn't a normal ghost...
...she's a special witch,
The Mudiyapairi.
The most dangerous kind of a witch.
Great, so now you have
caste system amongst the witches too.
Run!
Kattanni, let's go.
The witch kingdom has several types...
...this one is a Mudiyapairi...
Meaning?
The one with the inverted feet...
...the most dangerous kinds...
Their only dream was to get married.
And since they couldn't...
...they possess unmarried
young girls to fulfill their dreams.
I can exorcise ghosts,
witches, but not this kind...
Then who's an expert on this kind?
No one.
Getting this witch off
our back is next to impossible.
Same to same...
My father,
your uncle, Zuber's father...
...they all say the same about
their wives... as if they are also...
- Witches?
- Yes.
Babaji, there must be some way
to make this witch leave Roohi.
The only way to get rid of
her is when the girl will get married.
But her wedding wont be
her wedding alone...
...it'll be Mudiyapairi's wedding too.
And once Mudiyapairi gets married,
she will never leave you.
Whose wedding? How many weddings?
What are you saying?
The full moon's upon us.
No one can save her now.
Forget about the girl
and save your own life.
- Hurry up. Quickly.
- Keys...
You can't find the keys!
What a bunch of idiots!
Baba...
Oh, shit!
Kattanni.
Kattanni.
Van keys?
Keys?
- Hurry up or else...
- I don't have it.
You don't...
But you had it.
What are you doing?
"I wish there's no clamour, but only
spells of silence all around."
"No one's in this world,
except for the two us."
"I am lost in your dreams,
what better can I do?"
"O dreamy-eyed one
do tell what's your name?"
Your star-sign?
You seem like a Leo
from your personality.
Why so short-tempered?
Wear a pearl
on your pinky.
Kattanni, let's go.
Glory to Goddess!
No one's going anywhere.
I can come anywhere.
Kattanni, please anywhere but here.
You got the keys.
I did.
I got the keys and the smileys.
Did you see how
she flashed a smile at me?
I am in love, bro.
If she loves me too,
then she will turn around.
Turn...
No.
Turn...
No.
Turn!
Kattanni.
Turn...
She is Emily Rose
and not Rose from Titanic!
Kattanni.
Now that's my space beauty.
You saw how her face was glowing?
I could see the entire
galaxy in her eyes.
And her face...
Her face resembled the moon.
This moon has measles
on her face.
And not everything that
has craters is the moon.
Despo...
Falling for a witch.
You've lost your mind.
A boy in love loses his peace,
sleep, health, wealth everything...
I have just lost my mind...
Now hear me out...
...this is called hallucination.
All these talks about black holes
have made you an as***le.
I see, you're not happy for me.
Happy?
She's two people in one body.
Your 'girlfriend' is living inside
my girlfriend's body.
How can I be happy?
Girlfriend?
When did she become your girlfriend?
Nonsense...and you were
trying to flee, right...
...then why did you come back?
For true love,
Kattanni, you won't understand.
I came back for true love,
why else would I come back?
Wow. So one of us has to
sacrifice our true love now.
Well, this is what it has come to.
You've always supported me.
Remember,
when my father challenged me...
...to either earn ten grand
or sit at the butcher shop...
You helped me by robbing the
dowry of our friend's wedding.
Poor guy thought he never got dowry...
The pervert deserved it,
but what a slip I gave to him...
Whenever I have been in danger...
...you, my bro,
have always protected me.
Remember when Naeem stuck
that sharp compass on the desk?
You stuck your hand between
my bum and the compass.
It left a big hole in the palm.
My palm still reeks of your bum.
People call us Jai and
Veeru from the iconic Sholay.
Veeru gave his life for Jai.
Jai did...
Jai gave his life for Veeru.
And you're sacrificing
our friendship for a girl!
Wait a second...
You were going to sacrifice...
Me? Why would I
Yes, you...who else?
You've been sacrificing since
childhood, you cannot change now.
Don't be over sentimental...
To hell with this sacrifice...
I'm going to sacrifice
you in this forest.
Show some manners.
Bhawra!
I'm a yellow belt in Karate. Come.
Kattanni, don't. No cheating.
No stones.
You want to hit your own bro?
Hit me. Hit your bro.
- Bhawra, now you're cheating.
- Kattanni...
[Regional song]
[Regional song]
Wait a minute.
- You check.
- No, you check.
It's your girlfriend.
Roohi.
Roohi.
Roohi.
Roohi.
Slowly.
Are you okay, Roohi?
[Ringtone playing on phone]
I'll just take this call.
Wait.
Good evening, boss.
Take the girl back to Mujeerabad...
...dump her in some quiet
place and return to Bagadpur.
Dump her?
You mean Roohi.
The Police came all the way
to Bagadpur looking for the girl.
This can hamper business.
We won't get any more contracts.
The wedding's cancelled.
Take her back to the city.
That can't be done, boss.
Don't be square with me.
Boss, its a love triangle now...
cant help it.
Like in the film Saajan...
I'll bring Roohi back
respectfully as my wife.
Go to Ambiyapur.
Okay, boss.
So you've decided.
Decided what?
To leave...
To sacrifice...
Thank you.
Duffer...
If we weren't childhood friends...
I would have surely sacrificed you.
We're leaving
You, me, Roohi.
What about her?
Ok, all 4 of us.
But why?
You think our Boss will let us go...
Last time he only squeezed our nuts,
this time he'll break it for good.
Oh no...I am still a virgin.
I want my nuts intact.
Let's please elope...
But we'll have to find a safe place.
And if your Godzilla wakes up,
we would be caught.
- Show some respect...
- Consider it as a promotion.
From lizard to Godzilla.
If even one person gets to know,
then try hiding from Boss.
I'll quickly find a safe place,
and return soon.
You take care of Roohi.
Don't untie her. Just take care.
Good morning.
This...
So what if a cauliflower
isn't a flower...
...it's love and
fragrance will empower.
Sorry for keeping you tied up.
I know...
I don't mean to do what I do.
Yes...it's that...
See...
You scratched me last night...
It'll make a good tattoo.
nighT
Yes, starry night.
Ah nighT
nighT
I don't stutter.
That T is like t for me.
But I don't have a problem
with tongue twisters.
Mr. Tongue Twister tried to
train his tongue to twist and turn.
I don't stammer.
You've a pretty smile.
Keep smiling.
The other one scares me,
by always screaming.
When it happens, darkness engulfs me.
What I see...is just chaos.
At home, no one even talks to me,
except for my father.
They have tried many remedies.
Some say
it's a kind of split personality.
While some don't have an answer...
Don't cry, Roohi.
I miss my father.
But then I think you did
the right thing bringing me here.
At least the burden got off
from my family.
No, no, don't say such things.
Roohi...I'll get your
father and find your best cure.
Wait and watch.
I won't rest until I don't
get this other personality out of you.
Swear on this cauliflower.
You know, Roohi,
even I saw a lot of tragedy as a kid.
When I was in school...
Kattanni!
Don't untie her.
Gudiya for Mudiya.
You...didn't tell me your name yet.
Afza.
Roohi possessed by Afza.
Roohi-Afza.
Take good care of it.
She has literally raised me.
She's like a mother to me.
Hey, don't expect a lamb for
the cost of chicken.
That's the one for you.
That?
Yes, that.
Riddle, riddle,
a groom on horse means...
Marriage.
Sisters-in-law pranking
their brother-in-laws mean...
Marriage.
Getting high and
dancing means...
Marriage.
"I don't care for an angel anymore..."
"I don't care for an angel anymore..."
"I lost my heart to a ghost."
Are you ready?
Yeah!
Are you ready?
How's your kidney now?
Feels very good.
Run for us. Run for us.
Praise the lord.
Praise the lord.
Sir. Sir.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Ready.
He's ready!
Cancer? Heart attack? Kidney problem.
Witch problem.
Can you get rid of a witch?
I am ready to do anything you say.
Please, sir.
"Who cares about the
beauty and allure anymore."
"Who cares about the
beauty and allure anymore."
"I lost my heart to a ghost."
"Ghost."
"Ghost."
"Ghost."
Hold him, son! Hold him!
- Hey, hold his legs.
- He wont bite?
No.
Hold his legs.
What just happened?
Baba's job is to exorcise ghosts.
He has no control over
who the ghost possesses the next.
Is this some bluetooth ghost transfer?
Hey mister...
"I lost my heart to a ghost."
You know everything.
Who labeled you as a ghost.
You seem like an alien to me.
I am a witch!
Then why don't you possess me?
Ah, feeling shy
"I've convinced myself
for the moonless night."
"I'll eagerly await."
"My love story shall form,
I'll date the queen of ghosts."
She's cured.
Glory to Swami.
Glory to Swami.
Everyone, hear me.
Where is Swami?
There is no Swami.
It's all a sham, fake stories.
There is no such thing as a ghost.
All this is just to scare you,
and mislead you.
She was cured by science.
Always believe in science.
Glory to Science Baba.
Glory to Science Baba.
You'll realise when you
actually see a Mudiyapairi.
Oh...Bull dogs...?
So we're bulldogs now...?
And you're a cute Pomeranian.
Busy taking cute pictures here
and not reporting to the Boss?
Boss didn't install Wi-Fi, else
I would send him a daily video report.
You heard their demand, Pandit?
One wants Wi-Fi,
the other one wants a wife.
They underestimated us.
Boss said, the girl's
wedding is cancelled...
He wants you back Now!
Roohi.
Kattanni.
Roohi.
Oh no!
Roohi.
Are...you okay?
This...
it's...it's okay.
Nothing happened!
Kattanni.
Are you okay?
We'll have to get out of here.
Where will we go?
There is a place.
Chimattipur.
Boss.
Boss.
Sign these papers.
We've informed the Police.
They will come and
take your statement.
You'll be shocked to see it.
Both have been beaten to pulp.
One couldn't take it
and the other one
fell unconscious...here
Have you seen this girl?
Sir, show him the other picture.
Her?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Chimattipur.
The only place to exorcise ghosts, ghouls, spirits...
'Glory to Goddess Chimatti.'
'If you know of a person...'
'...who's been possessed by a ghost,
ghoul, or a spirit...
...then hand him over to
the Pandit at the reception.'
'Only the Pandits
of Chimattipur can...'
Keys.
Where?
There.
Here.
'And yes, one special warning.'
'Smoking, drinking, and Mudiyapairi
are banned in Chimattipur.'
Goodnight.
Go on.
This...
This...
Suit.
Don't worry, I am right beside.
Next door.
And...
Goodnight.
[Sanskrit chants]
Hey... morning.
[Sanskrit chants continue]
Come on. Hurry up!
Get down.
Come on.
Pandey.
Pandey.
You traveled on the roof?
It was a blast, man.
Where is Kattanni?
Sleeping.
- I called you...urgently...
- The suit you asked for.
Grey colour!
So what's the occasion?
Marriage.
Marriage?
You help me?
One last catch marriage.
- Catch marriage?
- Small one.
Who is getting married?
I met one girl. Roohi.
You?
And...
I'll tell you.
Long story.
- Glory to...
- Swami!
- Glory to...
- Swami!
He'll know when he
runs into a Mudiyapairi.
- Glory to...
- Swami!
- Glory to...
- Swami!
Only 200?
How much more prepaid do you need?
One more.
Even the cougars don't
ask for so much of recharge.
Are we good now or you
want the latest iPhone too?
The only solution is to get
the witch married...
...but then this wedding will be
of both - the girl and the witch.
Again, the wedding...
Back there you showed me the
overconfidence of Trump and here
you don't even have
a proper solution...
This is not an election,
so don't expect results so easily.
Do you know what kind of
a witch, Mudiyapairi is?
Do you know what a
Full Blue Moon does to her?
Full Blue Moon?
That bloody exorcist
also said the same...
When the most auspicious
constellation...
...and the Full Blue
Moon come together...
...this group of witches
set out on a hunt.
If they see the groom is sleeping the
witch possesses the body of the bride...
...then she has to get married...
...within a year before
the Full Blue Moon appears again.
And what if she can't get
married within a year?
Death.
Both for the witch and the girl.
What kind of horror story are you
making up, tell me what's the solution.
Tell me what to do.
Faux wedding.
What?
Faux wedding with the girl.
The witch is only focused on
her only desire to get married.
This witch just wants
to be someone's wife.
But what if the guy, she marries,
is already married to someone else?
Then?
Then the witch won't be his wife...
She will be his mistress.
And a witch will never
agree to be someone's mistress.
She will immediately forsake
the body of the mistress.
Oh, so if I marry
someone else first...
...and later marry Roohi, then
the witch will quit her body? Wow.
That's perfect then.
There is a risk involved.
Risk?
The witch might get furious.
And she might attack in a fit of rage.
This rage can harm the girl,
or her husband...
...or both.
Come on, isn't there some kind
of assurance of the plan working?
How can an old woman like me
give assurance?
It all depends on her mood.
You can take the risk
of getting married...
But we must find a girl
who has lost her will to live...
Got it?
Understood?
I understood.
I accept.
Accept what?
When you're prepared to risk your life,
then even I am ready to marry you.
But only marriage, no hanky-panky.
Why would I risk my life for you?
I am offering you a solution, and
you're offering me as the sacrifice?
Then its hardly a solution...
You made it sound like
you are some James Bond...
...and now throwing me under the bus?
You also got to take some risk.
Why should I risk?
Its my age to enjoy and have fun
and you want me to sacrifice for you?
Be practical, you don't have
much time left anyway...
...put it to someone's use.
Life's so short already,
and you wasted my time.
What a thankless idiot you are...
What?
You wont get a more
handsome husband than me...
...marry me.
Marry me.
Even my dog wouldn't marry you.
I am asking you, not your dog.
What a wild one you are.
Wait a second.
When Manish had trouble
with his stars...
...he got married to a
dog first to trick them.
If we can trick the stars,
then we can trick the witch too.
This is not some game...
Aunty...how about
I marry a dog...and...
Forget it.
Not a good idea.
Mind blowing idea!
Must appreciate your
wild brain, but listen...
...the wedding will have
to be with proper customs.
Nothing fake.
Okay.
Then find me a good dog.
Wait, how do you know all this?
What? You're getting too frank now...
It's been 40-years...
...but my feet are still
not completely straight.
Faux wedding.
And your husband.
Even your life's in danger, son.
There is a place...Chimattipur.
Across its river,
there's a pious place for dogs...
...that's where you can get married.
It's a different kind of
wedding you're talking about.
Anything for my Roohi.
And you'll let me shoot it?
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Where?
Someplace better than this.
Where is Bhawra?
Do you have a problem with me?
No, I don't have a problem with you.
He's just...more responsible.
You call him responsible?
Don't let his innocent face fool you.
He's the Casanova of old aunties
and you think he's responsible.
Look...your stars are in disarray.
It often affects the mind.
Don't worry,
I am friendlier than him.
Listen...please...go away.
I am already in a
lot of trouble and...
...I understand what
you two are up to.
But I won't let this wedding happen.
Whose wedding?
Yours with Bhawra.
Who said I am marrying him?
I see...
Why else has he got a tuxedo?
He can't marry without my permission.
Of course he can.
That's how we do it.
And what you're doing isn't right...
There is someone else inside you...
...and she too has desires.
So what if he has got the
American as his best man...
...but let the bride be mine...
Please...
Come on.
[Regional song]
[Regional song]
You got the flowers?
You forgot the sweets?
No, aunty, I got them.
[Regional song]
Hey, wait!
Call the groom.
I am ready.
But the bride is taking long
[Sanskrit chants]
Wow!
Groom's name.
Bhawra Pandey.
Bhawra Pandey, son of...
Tataiyya Pandey.
Tataiyya Pandey.
No, Tat...ok...
What's the bride's name?
What's the bride's name?
Preeti Kumari.
Preeti Kumari.
Let the bride and groom hold hands.
Grace her forehead.
Promise her every happiness be it,
mind, body, or soul.
Body too?
Isn't he getting too genuine?
Wedding has to be genuine
for the trick to work. Take an oath.
Congratulations.
There's still time.
Be calm, my dear. It's only for a day.
I'll find you a better partner.
Oh no!
Wow! So both of you
happily married, uh?
Come on then.
- But what's the matter?
- Get off the bloody boat...
- She might attack
- Beat him.
Charge...
But what's the matter?
Come here.
Tell him what happened?
What happened?
You knew that Mudiyapari witch is
banned in this town...right?
Didn't you read?
Chimattipur is blessed
to exorcise ghosts...
...and the only source of income
we priests have is...
...curing these possessed people.
Every morning, we offer the hair of
the possessed to the Goddess...
...as the hair gets burned in the
holy pit, the spirits get exorcised.
But today you got
this girl in the town...
...and the girl was possessed by
a Mudiyapairi witch.
And Mudiyapairi is
banned in Chimmatipur.
I knew it.
Something's possessing you.
Come lets get rid of
the ghost inside you...
- Please, no...
- Come on. Let's go.
Come, give me your hair...
Offer the hair, come...
Come on. Let's go.
Hey barber, come here.
Its a mudiyapairi witch!
Glory to Chimmati Goddess. Have mercy.
I must see Roohi.
I know the cure...
I'll get rid of the witch.
I have a cure.
You cant exorcise her...
If you take a contract,
then fulfill it...
Get us his bride, the wedding
is right around the corner.
Is this a joke?
What happened to your 100% record?
Your to-be bride is possessed
by a Mudiyapairi witch...
Oh please,
tell these folklores to my grandma...
Why don't you accept that age
has caught up with you?
Everyone, Guniya Shakeel is retiring
from 'catch marriage contracts!'
If you're destined to marry a witch,
then I'll get her for you.
This kind of silence is eerie.
Lets inform the groom...
...we can get her
any other girl but this.
Lets not confront the witch.
I've taken a contract.
I'll have to fulfil it.
No, please...
Why don't you let me die?
The full blue moon's in the sky.
Won't you get married even today?
I won't. I won't get married.
Its been a year with you and you
still consider me your enemy?
You have destroyed me.
Finished me completely...
You are my enemy.
Strength. I am your strength...
...the strength you never had.
I know all your fears.
I've seen all your pain...
...and you want to destroy me?
See beyond the pain.
Feel this power.
The only cure to all your
problems is...
Marriage.
Guniya boss, let's go.
Shut up.
You need to get married...
...and I have a contract to fulfill...
Tonight is important for both of us.
I have got a groom for you...
...and he too is
desperate to get married.
Accept my deal, else your life is
going to be in a jeopardy.
[Indistinct crowd chaos]
You know the cure?
How are you going to cure?
Bhawra...
Think about it,
why let her break our friendship.
We can let things be how they
are right now...
Can't we both marry her?
Are you nuts?
How can we both marry one girl?
But they are two and not just one.
Ok, I admit body is just one,
but I don't mind sharing her...
Don't be too kinky.
The body belongs
to Roohi not to your Godzilli.
Stay away from her.
I don't want a physical
relationship...
...this is platonic
love like never before.
Kattanni, she isn't a mobile phone
with two sim cards...
...that we use as per our network.
Control.
Get this, Bhawra.
If you don't allow,
I won't let her be yours...ever.
Then, I too wont let your Mudiyapari
stay in my Katy Perry's body.
Know that too.
Hey, Kattanni. Pandey.
Check this out. Look who I ran into.
That's your boss, right?
Shakeel.
See that...
The witch is so desperate.
All she wants is to get married...
Doesn't matter if it is a
Tom, Dick or some Kattanni.
Better than the boss using
her for his own advantage...
...let us come together.
You get married, I'll be fine.
Come on, Kattanni.
Put on my tuxedo.
We will bring your
bride back together.
Let's go.
[Indistinct chatter]
It is your girl.
Fine. Just kidding, Guniya sir.
The couple will take nuptial rounds
and the groom will take seven vows.
And you'll have to abide by
every oath for the rest of your life.
Do you accept?
Of course I will. Come.
[Sanskrit chants]
Wait. The bride is breaking
one vow to take another one.
I didn't expect this from you.
She broke my friend's heart.
Rascal, I'll crack...
My nuts...?
What will you do with all the nuts?
Get into the business of nut cracking
and quit this marriage business.
No wonder most marriages
you do are fake...
Absolutely fake...
Do not try to be smart.
What a dangerous henna style.
I know you're under
a lot of pressure...
...but how can you forget me so soon?
This is not a marriage,
it's a compromise...
...for yourself.
You will marry my groom. That's it.
Do not coerce me...
Let's see whose nuts crack now.
OMG.
Don't leave,
the wedding isn't over yet.
- Leave me.
- Be professional.
[Sanskrit chants]
Stop this faux wedding!
Who is she?
Faux wedding? What faux wedding?
This groom got married
to a dog earlier...
...and now he's trying to do
a faux wedding with you.
He is taking advantage of your
desperation and betraying you.
Oh Kattanni, no.
I don't know this stupid lady.
Here is the proof of his betrayal.
This...and this.
Shame on you, Kattanni.
This proves nothing.
Baby, she's hacked my account.
He'll trick you into making
a mistress, so you leave Roohi's body.
You as a mistress...
Kattani, you betrayed her?
Liar.
Baby, don't listen to her.
Sit down.
For the sake of God!
You.
You.
You'll marry me.
Me?
Ok, ok.
Don't beat me, I'll come.
Sorry, Kattanni.
Bhawra!
Coming. Coming.
Just lower your hand first.
Let me take this...
Start with the nuptial rounds.
What happened?
Are your feet heavy?
The moon will set. Hurry up.
You'll die.
You'll die too.
Let this marriage happen.
Who'll die?
Roohi.
Roohi, I'll handle everything.
This is the only cure.
Let's get married now. Come on.
Come on.
How long will I depend on others?
Roohi...
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't do this...
We shall live together
and be together forever.
It's my promise.
You have given me strength,
will protect and cherish it with you.
Today, Roohi will marry Afza
and be happy together.
[Sanskrit shlok continue]
If you accept these promises...
then even I...
...on this final night
of Full Blue Moon...
...I accept the vows with you.
Whosoever love is true...
...his love will
definitely turn around.
Turn.
Turn.
Turn.
That's them.
Namaste Dad.
Where is Roohi?
She ran away.
With whom?
Herself.
Hey, we're not really a couple...
Aunty, what about the dog...
Aunty?
Oh no!
