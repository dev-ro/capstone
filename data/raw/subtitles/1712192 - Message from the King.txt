[indistinct announcement over PA]
[woman over PA] ...flight number 2671
now in final boarding...
Jacob, it's Bianca.
I'm in trouble. I need your help, please.
I have something they want.
Jacob, I don't know what to do.
[sobs] Please, call me.
[woman] How long will you be staying here
in Los Angeles, Mr. King?
One week.
My return flight to Cape Town
is on the 5th.
It's there on the ticket, ma'am.
[woman] You haven't given us an address
where you're gonna be staying.
I'm not sure.
[man] Do you have any friends here,
or any family?
I have to find a hotel.
[woman] With $600 in cash for seven days
and no credit card?
I'll make it last.
[man]
That's your idea of a vacation, Mr. King?
Took me three months to save that...
and the ticket.
I don't make much.
[woman] You drive a cab in Cape Town?
That's right.
[man] But you can make more money
driving a cab in Los Angeles,
right, Mr. King?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[man]
Working, staying here in Los Angeles.
I have no intentions of working...
or staying.
And that's the truth.
[airplane flies overhead]
[horns honk]
[music over dialogue]
Do you have a room?
Sixty-five a night, cash up front.
[money rustles]
I need to see an ID.
My first name's George.
My rules or you're out.
No hookers, queers, puntas, parties,
junk weed, crack, meth, or loud music.
Not that you seem the type, Mr. King.
202.
[indistinct chatter]
[unlocks door]
[TV playing nearby]
[unzips bag]
- [woman chattering]
- [children shouting]
[Jacob] Bianca.
[pounding on door]
Bianca!
- Hello? Can I help you?
- I hope so.
I'm looking for someone.
- I think I have the right address, but...
- Who are you looking for?
My sister. Bianca Zagosin.
Do you know her?
- And you are?
- Her brother, Jacob.
[chuckles] Yeah, I remember you.
I've seen you in photos. I'm Trish.
Trish.
You're a lot cuter in person.
Come on in.
- So, you just get in?
- Yeah.
- My sister, she lives next door, nay?
- Used to.
You know, I haven't talked to Bianca
in, like, forever.
It was actually right around my birthday.
I don't know, to me, she seemed fine.
It's just all of a sudden,
she just bugged out.
She just left, didn't say goodbye,
didn't say anything,
didn't leave a forwarding address.
I asked the landlords.
So they both moved out?
Yeah. Her and Armand did.
You mean Alex, her husband?
No, her and Armand.
Alex hasn't been around in forever.
- Who's Armand?
- Their boy.
Boy?
- Bianca has a child?
- It's not hers. It's Alex's kid.
How do you not know this?
You guys don't talk much?
No, no, but she tried calling,
and now her phone is disconnected.
Oh, so you're just worried?
She's my little sister.
That's sweet.
So, where did Alex go?
They had a big argument.
She didn't tell me what about.
And he just left her. With his kid?
Yeah.
You wanna sit down?
You don't like Alex?
I only met him once. In Cape Town.
I think Alex got into
some sort of money trouble.
- [door opens, closes]
- It was a mess.
[keys jingle]
Hey.
This is Jacob, Bianca's brother.
Cool.
- How'd the audition go?
- [dishes clatter]
[man] You've gotta be kidding me.
No more fucking ice!
[thudding]
- [Trish speaks indistinctly]
- [man] Know what?
Can you not do this shit right now?
[Trish] He's looking for Bianca.
Give me one second.
You know what? She left some stuff here.
Let me grab that for you.
[man] What did she leave here?
[Trish]
It's just a bag of her stuff, Bill.
[Bill] How could you let him in?
Sorry about that.
It's all right.
We are having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.
I told everyone 8:30,
but stuff doesn't get really hopping
until, like, 10:30, so you should come by.
- Okay.
- Great. See you later.
Do you happen to know
who Bianca paid her rent to?
Yeah, Mrs. Lazlo.
Go down the street,
there's a white building, go to the back.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
[Lazlo] Excuse me for saying this,
but your sister's husband
was a cheap son of a bitch.
Wasn't one month I got the rent on time.
It was always a fight.
Good thing they moved her out,
'cause I was about to throw her out.
- Who moved her out?
- Oh, some pal of her old man's, Zeke...
That's right, Zico.
Slicked back hair, you know,
asshole, Mediterranean.
Didn't expect the check to clear.
- So, Bianca owes you money?
- No, he squared up on everything.
God knows how she pulled that off.
He didn't even complain
about losing the deposit.
Guess he knew what a mess she was.
Did you see her before she went?
When she moved in here,
she was a nice young woman.
Polite. Pretty, too.
Last time I saw her, sonny...
she looked terrible,
beat up and strung out.
I'm sorry, but that's how it was.
This friend, Zico, I don't know him.
Do you know where I can find him?
[Lazlo] The name on the check
was Carbodiam Carwash.
It's, uh... It's over on Prospect Street.
Maybe he works there.
[men chatter in foreign language, laugh]
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Zico.
There's nobody here called Zico.
- Mm-hmm.
- What's this about, my friend?
I'm looking for my sister. Bianca.
Bianca Zagosin.
Zico knows her.
He might be able to help me find her.
[speaks foreign language]
There's nobody here called Zico.
We can't help you.
[children laughing]
[chattering]
Hello.
Excuse me. Is this the Yung Du Market?
[woman speaks Korean]
Excuse me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- What you buying?
I'm not buying anything, ma'am.
I just want to know
if you've seen this woman.
- No, I don't know. I don't know.
- This woman, does she...
- Does she shop here?
- I'm busy. I'm working.
Sorry. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.
Mom, what's the problem?
[speaks Korean]
What's going on, man?
I only want to know if you've seen
this woman and perhaps the kid.
[conversing in Korean]
Uh...
- You're not from around here, are you?
- No. South Africa.
[speaking Korean]
I don't remember her,
but I've seen this kid in here for sure.
When was the last time?
Maybe two, three weeks ago.
Who are they?
My sister and her boy.
I'm looking for them. They've disappeared.
What did she say?
She's asking if you've checked the morgue.
All right, this is case number 4372.
Female African-American,
found in a dumpster up on Manchester.
Cause of death,
OD from prescribed psychiatric medication.
Seems the dumpster was her home.
- Not her.
- Yeah. All right.
Back up, back up.
Nah. It's the wrong demographic.
Mid-50s, found in a bathtub,
trying to pretend she was a fish.
All right, number 4410 right here.
Yeah, I remember you, baby.
Found in a stolen vehicle
up on West Olympic.
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma to the head.
Made the Channel 4 news.
We had one just like this
a couple years back.
Gang shit.
Man, them motherfucking gangs these days.
Come on, tell me this ain't her.
It's not her.
God be praised.
Or are you all up into Allah and shit?
I gotta say something here.
You exotic Negroes
is some cold-blooded motherfuckers.
Most people be in the john by now...
[fades out]
[shouts]
[sobs]
[woman moaning loudly]
[man] Okay, enough of that.
Just use your mouth.
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. [chuckles]
Wrong room.
It's the only room with the porno working,
so I gotta keep it free.
Here you go.
You're in 210 now.
Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. King.
Now what the...
What the fuck do you want, man?
- [speaks foreign language]
- What the fuck?
Get him!
[grunting]
[shouting]
[grunts]
Fuck! You're fucking with the wrong guy!
Oh, God!
- Ah, shit!
- [grunts]
You killed my sister. You tortured her!
Why? Why?!
- They told us to.
- Who told you?
[choking]
Give me back my fucking phone!
- [phone beeps]
- [man shouts]
[gasping]
[screams]
Whoever you work for, tell them
this was a message from the King.
[siren in distance]
- [chattering]
- [rap music playing]
[Bill] Trish, open up the fucking door.
I know you're in there.
Open the fucking door!
Open the fucking door!
I swear to God,
I'm gonna break this door down.
Where is your girlfriend?
Listen, man, we've had enough trouble
with your sister already.
So I'd really appreciate it
if you leave Trish alone.
[Trish] Whoo!
What the hell were you doing in there?
- Bill, stop.
- Stop!
Why do you always have to get
so fucked up?
- Stop.
- Come here.
You must be Jacob.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Bianca's brother, right?
So, how long are you in town for?
I'm glad you made it.
What's wrong? You look a little tense.
Are you okay?
- We need to talk.
- Okay, let's talk.
[sniffs]
Did you do this with Bianca?
Mm-hmm.
You do other things with her?
Is that why he hates her?
Your boyfriend?
I liked her. She liked me.
Mm.
And I like you.
Did Bianca do a lot of blow?
Mm-hmm.
- Did she score it for you?
- [laughs]
Mm-hmm.
She turned me on to Zico's boy, Frankie.
Deals on wheels.
Who is Zico?
[fumbles with belt] Hmm?
- How do you know him?
- He's one of Alex's boys.
Shh.
What are you doing?
[laughs]
- What the fuck?
- [Trish] I'm sorry.
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. No, no, come here.
Look at me, look at me.
Hey, look at me. Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.
- No...
- [Bill shouts]
[Trish] Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.
Come here. Come here.
[dance music playing]
[Jacob] How much for an eight ball?
- Sorry?
- You heard me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Does he think I'm dealing or something?
That's what I've been told.
- Patricia, who is this guy?
- It's Bianca's brother.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
It's good to meet you, mate. Welcome.
What brings you to this neck of the woods?
I'm looking for Bianca.
Right.
I haven't actually seen her
for a while, I'm afraid.
It's like everyone in this fucking place.
They're here one minute, gone the next.
Fucking nomadic culture, you know?
Yeah.
I have to wonder why
she'd lose touch with her dealer,
with her drug problem and all that.
Keep your fucking voice down, mate.
And I'm not a dealer, okay?
I deal in pleasure, and I deliver it
to a very select fucking few.
You get to cussing when you get nervous,
did you know that?
'Course I'm fucking nervous.
You're going around shouting
that I'm some shithead dealer.
It's a reasonable question.
You are her dealer.
You probably know where she is. Do you?
- You're off.
- What?
You're off the fucking list. Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is your problem?
I mean, who even talks
to someone like that?
- [Frankie] Yes, he's here.
- [chain clinks]
Of course I'm fucking sure.
I was talking to him, mate.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- [slaps]
[Frankie shouts]
[grunts]
You didn't answer my question.
Why did they kill Bianca?
- I don't...
- Why?
All right. All right.
All right, she fucking...
- Tell me.
- She pissed them off. [stammers]
She had something that they wanted.
I don't know what the fuck it was though.
I swear I don't know.
- Pissed who off? Pissed who off?
- The guys Zico works for.
Who does he work for?!
All right. It's the... It's th...
It's the Du... The Duke.
All right.
He's called the fucking Duke, I swear.
[Trish shouts] Let him go!
- [Bill] Get inside!
- [Frankie sobs]
Go tell Duke.
[Frankie] That's not mine.
He's gonna fucking kill me.
[siren wails]
[bell dings]
I saw you out there.
Um...
About earlier...
you know...
the guy at the motel?
I wanted to say thank you.
For what?
For not, um...
I don't fuck them.
You have to keep a roof
over your head.
Nay?
[silverware clinks]
Let me see that.
Wow.
She's pretty.
Who is she?
So, what are you doing
in this shitty ass place?
You mean here? Or Los Angeles?
Both.
Is it about her?
You looking for her?
Everybody's looking for something
in this place.
You come here looking
for the one thing in the world
that you think is gonna make you happy.
And then after a few years...
all you wanna do is get the hell out.
Have you ever seen this place in the rain?
It's like rotting cardboard. Same smell.
But then, the rain clears
and the sun shines,
and the air smells
like jasmine and orange.
[sighs] And you think that maybe...
maybe it's not so bad.
Maybe you're gonna stay and...
give it another go.
And then what you think
was a pile of trash gets up and...
starts pushing a cart full of cans.
Sleeping under a bridge.
[sniffs]
The little girl with you at the motel...
is she your daughter?
Yeah.
- How old is she?
- She's eight.
Give this to her.
I think maybe she will like it
because it has the elephant on it.
[makes galloping sound]
[laughs]
She loves elephants.
Thank you.
I'm Kelly, by the way.
- Jacob.
- Jacob.
[sniffles]
It was nice talking to you.
Okay.
[bell dings]
[water running]
- Hey.
- Hello. Um...
Can you hold onto this for me?
I have to go out.
I don't want to leave it in the room.
Okay.
Eksê, I have a favor to ask.
You've got a car, nay?
Can I use it? Only for a few hours.
I can pay you.
Hell, that's more money than it's worth.
Hang on.
Fucked up Camry downstairs.
- New Mexico plates, can't miss it.
- Thank you.
You wanna come in?
This is Boot.
No, no, it's all right.
- I have to go. Chop, chop.
- Okay.
Oh, my God. Are you fucking kidding me?
Get out of here. Get away.
Did Bianca leave anything else with you?
- Dude, back the fuck off my space.
- She had something they wanted.
I don't give a shit about your problems.
- Tell me!
- Get out of here!
Tell me everything
that happened with Alex!
Tell me the truth! The truth.
- Huh?
- Okay.
They argued all the time. Okay?
I heard them. They argued all the time.
- And one day, Alex was just gone.
- Where?
I don't fucking know.
She said they had a big fight.
All his shit was still there.
I don't fucking know, man.
He just left, all right?
She wasn't even fucking mad.
She was just scared.
What happened after that?
She came to me one day
and gave me a fucking bag
with all her shit in it,
and told me not to tell Zico.
I mean, I don't know, man.
She was fucking freaked out
about something.
What do you want me to tell you?!
- Was Bianca getting her teeth fixed?
- What?
Her teeth.
Was she getting her teeth fixed?
[laughs]
Bianca wasn't getting shit fucking fixed.
You're fucking crazy, man.
I found Bianca at the morgue.
She'd been tortured.
They cut off her foot.
They blinded her.
[Trish] Don't... Don't tell me that shit.
Don't fucking come over to my house
and tell me that shit!
You don't think I cared for her?
I was the only person that cared for her!
Where the fuck were you?
[line ringing]
This is Duke.
Hello?
Mr. Lawenda. I called.
- I have an 11:30 appointment.
- Of course.
You haven't seen Dr. Wentworth before,
have you, Mr. Lawenda?
No, but I have seen his work.
If you could fill this out,
Dr. Wentworth will be with you
in a moment.
Very good.
[woman] Mr. Lawenda?
Mr. Lawenda?
Dr. Wentworth's ready for you.
[door opens]
Mr. Lawenda.
A man after my own heart.
You don't like filling in forms.
Not a problem.
I'll get everything as we go along.
Now your notes say
you've been having some pain.
Let's take a look at those top molars,
shall we? Open wide.
Nothing immediately apparent.
You should get some X-rays, I think.
It says your sister referred you.
- I don't think I remember her.
- Bianca.
Bianca, of course.
Bianca left me your name.
She also left me something else.
I'm looking after it for her.
It's something I think you want.
I can't imagine what that would be.
I'm afraid...
there wasn't much Bianca had that anyone
in their right mind would want.
Apart from her looks, of course.
And her teeth.
They must be beautiful now,
with all the work she had done on them.
I wasn't expecting to be paid,
if that's what you're suggesting.
This isn't about money.
It nearly always is.
You know, part of me's been wondering
if someone would come looking for her.
Hoping, in fact.
I hated the idea that she was just
another Los Angeles orphan
who might sink without trace.
I always meant to ask her
if she had any family.
Well... you're my last appointment
of the morning.
Can I buy you some lunch?
The average middle-class American
spends almost a thousand bucks
on each of those teeth in their lifetime.
You multiply that four or five times
in a place like this.
My point is,
I have a very good reputation...
I have a very good practice,
and, all in all, a very good life.
There would be very little sense in me
jeopardizing that.
Let me tell you something.
Dentists are for men
what gynecologists are for women.
Once you have them wide open
and your hand is inside them...
their sense of shame just drops away.
You become trusted with their confidences.
Sometimes, you send them home
with a prescription
that's a little more fun
than what the problem requires.
And other times...
Well, if you can help out
a little more substantively
and nobody's going to get hurt,
then why not help out?
What if somebody did get hurt?
Bianca?
Why would you say that?
She could be anywhere right now.
She could be sitting in the Starbucks
around the corner, for all we know.
She was always disappearing,
and she always turns up again.
You know Bianca.
I used to think so.
I'm not sure if I do anymore.
- Where did you meet?
- At a party.
She had a lot going for her.
I know people. She wanted me
to make some introductions,
- and so I did. I helped her out.
- Did you sleep with her?
No. As a matter of fact, I didn't.
- I'm married.
- So was she.
Look, I'm not apologizing for it.
She needed the money.
She never did anything
she didn't want to do.
Why did some man move out
all her things...
- and pay all her debt?
- I'm the wrong one to ask, I'm afraid.
All I know is that her husband
got himself into some serious trouble,
owed some money to the wrong guys.
[signs check]
Last I heard,
he wound up in a ditch somewhere.
After he was gone,
Bianca got strung out. She...
She started doing stuff
she shouldn't have been doing.
If she has any sense,
she's probably got the hell out of Dodge
for a while.
That's most likely what she did.
Well, goodbye then, Mr...?
I guess it must be King.
Bianca's maiden name, right? King.
She told me. Bianca King.
Yeah.
I'm sorry I can't be any more help,
but you'll find her, I'm sure.
Bianca plays the innocent,
but she's a survivor.
Trust me, she's fine.
And if there's anything else I can do,
just give me a call, okay?
[alarm beeps]
[starts engine]
[sighs]
I run 20 hours a day.
Nineteen I work.
One I get to myself, one.
You know what I do?
I come down here, alone.
No staffers. Nothing.
We had an agreement.
Until the campaign was over,
your office in Beverly Hills,
me in the chair,
is the only place we'd meet.
We did. We agreed.
I've got a situation, Frank.
What do you want?
[Wentworth]
Something I want to get rid of.
I need one of your special favors.
[Frank]
I thought you had associates
who could handle that kind of thing.
[Wentworth]
This is way out of their league.
I need this done right.
That's why I've come to you.
Two men. 25 each.
Fifty grand? Jesus.
I don't know what this is about,
and I don't want to know.
- You don't nickel and dime me on it.
- All right. I understand.
If anybody saw you here...
you're my dentist.
You came down here personally
to give me a campaign donation.
[chuckles]
Fine. You've got my vote.
Don't forget to floss, Frank.
[tires squeal]
[starts engine]
- Hello, Dr. Wentworth.
- Martine, how are you?
- Good, how are you?
- Very well.
- I've been flossing like you said.
- Let's have a look.
Very good. Where's Mike?
[indistinct conversation]
[Mike] Tom, you gotta hold steady.
Just focus on the positives.
There's a core audience out there,
you know. We can build on that.
I've been down this road
a hundred times, and so have you.
Yeah. Now trust me on this.
All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Okay, till then.
Hey, you still there? Okay, listen to me.
I don't care what the contractor says.
I don't care what the engineer says.
I hate that bathroom,
and I fucking hate that kitchen.
You do what I say, or you can go back
to designing those strip malls, okay?
Jesus.
[groans]
I ask my architect
to change one little thing,
move one little door, he freaks out.
- Artists.
- Eh, tell me about it.
He's worse than a fucking director.
I got a $100 million movie
that's tracking like a turkey,
and it opens in two weeks.
I got a TV series that's just been
picked up, I still haven't cast it.
And then my dentist... Ho-ho.
My dentist leaves me a message
saying he's got to meet me at my house,
and then he doesn't pick up the phone.
This better be good, Paul.
So, what is it?
What have you come to say?
It's Bianca.
She's got a brother.
He's in town,
says he has what we've been looking for.
He's out of control, Mike.
You told me Bianca
was not a problem anymore.
Bianca isn't a problem anymore.
I'm afraid that's his problem.
Oh, my God, you didn't.
- Your guys didn't... Please tell me no.
- Look, spare me the hand-wringing.
You said handle it, it got handled.
- What does he want?
- $750,000.
[laughs]
Three quarters of a million bucks,
is he fucking nuts?
Yes.
I spent three hours
in my office this morning
patching up one of Duke's men.
This isn't negotiable, Mike.
You've got no leverage here.
I've seen what this guy can do.
He's not like his sister.
Sounds to me
he's just like his fucking sister.
- His teeth...
- His teeth?
They're not like hers.
Compound fillings, recent bridge...
This guy takes care of himself.
- You've seen this guy's teeth?
- Oh, yes.
You can tell a lot from a person's teeth.
- Like what?
- Like he's not going to go away.
Like he's not going to screw up.
- We have to deal with him, Mike.
- Seven hundred and fif...?
No fucking way.
[Wentworth] Did Bianca ever talk to you
about where she was from?
- South Africa somewhere.
- Cape Flats.
Has one of the highest murder rates
in the world.
The Number gangs, you heard of them?
Bianca got out.
Her brother stayed.
We have no idea what he's capable of.
There is an alternative, but...
you probably won't want to consider it.
[Mike] Try me.
I spoke to Leary.
- He's willing to help us out.
- Leary? Are you out of your fucking mind?
Leary is running for office,
for Christ's sake.
He finds out he's on that thing too,
we're all dead.
This is your mess, Mike.
How much does Leary want?
A hundred grand. Cash.
First you fix our teeth,
then you suck our dicks,
then you suck our blood.
Fuck you, you tick. You fucking nobody.
Fucking nobody fucking dentist!
That 750, I'm still going to need it.
You said a hundred!
What are you talking about?
- I gave you a hundred!
- Not for Leary, Mike.
For me.
You're squeezing me?
You're fucking squeezing me?
That's a fucking loser's plan, pal.
You arranged all this!
It was your fucking party!
Yes, but at your house.
I'm there, but I'm not in the room.
I'm not doing what you're doing, Mike,
and I'm just your fucking nobody dentist.
Worst I get is a red face, but you,
everything you have, you'll be gone, Mike.
Out. Finito.
Fuck you.
[shouts] Fuck you! Fuck you!
- How is he?
- [Mike shouts] Fuck you!
Fuck you!
[man] Are you okay, Mike?
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No.
[stammers]
You take off. I'll see you in the morning.
Where are the boys?
Oh, uh, the usual.
Killing each other.
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]
[line ringing]
- [man] Yes?
- This is Paul Wentworth.
- Frank Leary gave me your number.
- [man] What's the job?
[siren wails]
[officer on PA] Pull over to the right.
[turn signal clicking]
Shit.
License and registration, please, sir.
Are you aware you should have registered
this vehicle two years ago, sir?
- It belongs to a friend.
- A friend?
Your license, please.
I'm sorry, officer,
my wallet's at my hotel.
You're required by law
to have your license with you
whenever you drive.
Yeah, my apologies. That was my mistake.
- Step out of the car, please, sir.
- You see, officer,
- I'm not from here.
- Step out of the car, please, sir.
[grunts]
- What's your name?
- Jacob King.
[officer] JJ Motel, 1723 Argyle,
room 210.
Jacob King.
Yeah, it's him.
What do you want us to do with him?
Yeah.
[horns honking]
[thunder rumbles]
[shouts] Call the police!
- Please!
- What the fuck?
- They're gonna kill me!
- Mom, look!
Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Calm the fuck down.
- Please help me! Help me!
- Calm down!
- They're gonna kill me!
- Calm the fuck down!
- They're gonna kill me!
[continues screaming]
- Hey!
- Calm the fuck down!
[grunts]
Jesus.
[men grunting]
Let's finish him here.
We can leave him in the dumpster.
He said the harbor, we do the harbor.
Fuck the harbor. Let's just go.
Get the car.
Get the fucking car.
Fine.
[thunder rumbling]
[Jacob groans]
[horn honks]
[thunder crashes]
[man] Hey!
You!
- What are you doing over there?
- Get the fuck out of here!
You a cop?
Yeah, what's it to you?
I said get the fuck out.
Okay. Okay, man.
We don't want no trouble.
Fuck!
Where the hell is he?
How the hell did you lose him?
What the fuck are we gonna tell him?
- If he finds out about this...
- No.
We tell him he's dead.
We tell him he's fucking dead!
Jacob.
[panting]
Okay. Hold on.
Okay, that's it. Okay. Okay. Keep going.
[Kelly grunts loudly]
Okay. Okay. [grunts]
- [shrieks]
- [Jacob thuds]
[Kelly] Okay. Oh!
[panting] Okay. Shit.
[whimpers] Oh!
[mouths]
[children laugh]
[laughs, screams]
[screams]
You made a sound investment.
Problem's gone.
Good.
Good. Excellent.
I still want that 750. I'm giving you
48 hours. I'll be waiting for your call.
Jesus Christ, Paul.
You know what you are?
You're nothing
but a cheap blackmailing fuck.
And what are you, Mike?
[laughs]
[dishes clatter]
- Mr. Audubon...
- Susan.
- I've taken some pills. I think I'm dying.
- Susan.
[crowd gasping on TV]
- [man] Get an ambulance!
- [man 2] She just fell over.
[sighs]
[Boot whispers] Why are you just sleeping?
Did you get right back there?
That's right.
[kisses]
Okay, I love you. Sweet dreams.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
[Wentworth] How many times, guys?
- King's dead.
- All right, we checked the morgue.
Nobody pulled out of water.
No black John Does, either.
They all got names.
King's not one of them.
And the car he was driving?
Out of state plates.
- Where'd he get it, huh? Huh?
- Jesus, guys.
He stole it. Who knows?
Who fucking cares?
Guy's far out to sea by now.
He's crab food.
Why Leary, Paul? Why take that risk?
My guys could have handled King.
Oh, yeah?
- Like they handled him last time?
- [speaks foreign language]
- What did the cops cost?
- Fifty large each. Preston paid.
Paid you? Or did you pay Leary?
I don't like this, Paul. Any of it.
There is shit you're not telling me.
There always is.
You leveraging Preston?
Is that it?
Huh?
What are you getting?
We're partners, Paul.
We split down the middle.
That's the deal.
I find out you're fucking me again,
it'll be last time.
Don't get all Balkan on me, Duke.
You think my clients give a damn
who supplies me the drugs and the girls?
You think I do?
Bianca's dead and gone.
So's her brother.
[TV playing]
[woman on TV]
Leary has also seen an increasing list
of high-profile local business leaders
and entertainment personalities
stepping onboard to endorse Leary
and his strong anti-City Hall,
anti-corruption...
What is this?
"Speak no evil."
Good words.
My little brother was "hear no evil."
Who could have thought...?
Bianca was "see no evil."
She was my sister.
The girl you asked me about in the photo.
We got the tattoos when we were kids.
Called ourselves "The Three Kings."
It was Bianca's idea.
Good thoughts, good words... good deeds.
Bianca always saw the good in everything.
What was your little brother's name?
Isaac.
He was so smart.
Such a little prankster.
[laughs]
So much so that...
he ended up in trouble...
in prison.
By the time he got out,
he had become affiliated
with one of the Numbers gangs.
With the gangs, in blood you go into them,
and only in blood do you get out.
After Isaac was killed...
Bianca couldn't see any good
in the Cape Flats.
She blamed me for his death.
Said I should have been able to stop it.
Maybe she was right.
She met her husband, ran away.
They came here.
Maybe I should have been able
to stop that, too.
Did you find her?
I found her in the mortuary.
She'd been beaten and tortured.
I'm so sorry.
Do you think it's the same people
who beat you?
Yeah.
She didn't think she could come to me...
until it was too late.
Maybe some people
don't wanna be stopped.
[cries softly]
[TV in background]
[TV] We're gonna give the lieutenant
a little concert.
Can you hear me, Lieutenant?
I want to ask you one question
and then you can go.
What are you looking for?
Maybe I can help you.
[woman on TV] You've got nerve.
- You like crazy drums, Lieutenant?
- You like crazy drums, Lieutenant?
[drums playing on TV]
[man screams]
[speaking Korean]
What happened, man?
Can you look at what's on this?
Yeah, I can try.
- It's a QuickTime file. A video.
- Yeah.
- You know the password?
- No, I don't.
Okay, it's encrypted,
and it's above my skill set,
but I know a person
who could hook you up.
It'll just take two or three days.
Maybe we can get to the audio.
[garbled audio]
[Bianca] Armand...
I want you to go with Mike.
Mike will take care of you.
Hi, Leary.
I get to suck the nation's dick.
[turns off audio]
I don't know, man.
Sounds like some kind of porno.
Sorry.
[singing in Spanish]
I just got some news.
That car King was driving
was registered in New Mexico.
Kelly Johnson.
She's staying at the same motel King was.
[Duke] That's the news?
- King stole her car?
- No.
She never reported the car stolen.
[Kelly] Hey, Earth to Boot. Yoo-hoo.
I got pizza. You're crazy, come here.
I don't want you watching so much TV.
You'll turn into a zombie.
All right, there you go.
Do you want Sprite or Coke?
- [Boot] Um, Sprite.
- [Kelly] Sprite it is.
Can I have some cookie dough
after dinner?
[Kelly] Uh, yeah, you can.
Hey, I got pizza for you.
It's pepperoni. So, wanna sit down?
Do you want some beer?
I don't actually have any,
but I could go pick some up.
Where are you going?
Is this about Bianca?
What difference
is it going to make to her now?
[door closes]
[engine starts]
- [distant siren wailing]
- [helicopter blades whirring]
[video game gunfire]
[inaudible chatter]
Okay, see you in the morning, Scott.
- Drive safe.
- All right, see you.
[door opens]
[door closes]
[video game gunfire]
[cell phone ringing]
Hey, Scott, you still here?
[Jacob] I'm Bianca's brother.
I'm in your office.
I've got what you want,
and you've got what I want.
How did you...?
So, where is it?
Play it.
Play it!
[typing]
It's okay, Mike.
[Mike] Look at the camera.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me.
I love you so much.
[shouts in foreign language]
What are you doing with the boy?!
This is why you killed her.
Can you believe it? Leveraging me.
She wanted the boy back
less than a week after she sold him to me.
- Bianca sold you her kid?
- He wasn't her kid.
He belonged to her idiot husband
who got killed by his gangster pals.
That's why they were pimping her out.
To make the money back
that he stole from them.
She sold me Armand to pay off the debt.
Then the stupid bitch changed her mind.
Armand's happy here.
He's got friends. I've given him a home.
He was living on the street.
I'm a decent guy.
Bianca may have been strung out,
but we had a deal.
What the fuck was she thinking?
That Armand would go back? To her?
750, right?
That's what Wentworth said you wanted.
[mutters]
[safe opens]
You know the irony in all this?
Turns out you're the only straight dealer
in this whole goddamn mess.
Okay. Just... Just take a breath.
Just breathe for a minute.
Breaking and entering, self-defense,
plus you're black.
[Mike screams]
[moaning]
- [Jacob] Except you're lying!
- [ringing]
[Scott] Hey, Mike,
I left my phone somewhere.
Oh, God.
Please! Please, what do you want?
[video game gunfire]
[screams] Help! Mike! Mike, help!
- No! No!
- [Jacob] Sit!
Please don't.
Don't do anything to me, please.
Please, I don't have anything.
[both screaming]
- [line rings]
- Only what I tell you.
Mike shot himself. The safe is open.
There's money everywhere.
Now tell him.
Scott? What's wrong? What is it?
I walked into Mike's office
and he's killed himself.
He blew his brains out.
[stammers]
There's money all over the place.
You've got to get over here, Paul.
You better get over...
[muffled shouting]
[line rings]
Mr. Ducmajian.
This is Jacob King. I'm at Preston's.
Dr. Wentworth is on his way.
[muffled screams]
[static hissing]
[muffled shout echoes]
- [gun cocks]
- [muffled scream]
- [shouting]
- [gunshot]
[muffled screams continue]
I'm Jacob, Bianca's brother.
I'm going to take you to a safe place.
Get away from me!
Get dressed.
We don't have much time.
- [screaming]
- Shh.
Trust me. I am your friend.
King. His name... His name is King.
He killed Mike. He did it. He killed him.
Oh, God. Paul, thank God you came.
You gotta cut me loose.
We gotta get out of here.
[screams] We gotta get out of here!
Paul!
- [muffled scream]
- Shh.
[Scott] We gotta get out of here!
Paul. Paul, help me. Help me.
Come here, you gotta help me.
Cut me loose. Please.
We gotta get out of here.
What are you...?
What are you doing? Please.
[Scott gagging]
[Armand struggling]
[Jacob murmurs indistinctly]
Shh!
[Martine] Dr. Wentworth?
You want to stay for dinner?
[Wentworth] No.
You're going to die if you stay here.
- I have to get back.
- [tires screech]
[Armand squeals]
[Jacob] Shh.
What's going on?
Wait. No, you wait here.
[Zico] Get him.
- Zico...
- [speaks foreign language]
[Armand squeals]
[men grunting]
Duke, you've gotta believe me.
I was going to split it.
He called me. King.
He told me you'd be here.
[sobs]
The bag was just lying there.
I was wondering where this was.
[shouts in foreign language]
Motherfucker! Fuck!
Okay, sit right here.
Where is your mother?
We have to leave here right away.
[grunts]
[screams]
[Boot] Stop it!
- Go to your room!
- [screaming]
- [screams continue]
- [loud thuds]
- [man] Are you happy to see me, Mr. King?
- [Jacob shouting]
- [Boot screams] Mommy! Mommy!
- [Kelly gasps, screams]
[screams]
No!
[yelling]
[screams] No!
- [clanking]
- [sobs]
[man shouts in foreign language]
- [Boot] Mommy!
- [screams]
- [Kelly screams]
- [Jacob shouts]
[distorted shouting]
[panting]
[Boot and Kelly crying]
Armand!
Armand!
[sirens nearby]
[horn honks]
Armand?
[shouts] Armand!
[rain falling]
[thunder rumbling]
[man] All aboard, ma'am.
[Kelly sniffles, sighs]
[gasps]
[no audible dialogue]
- Welcome back, detective.
- [speaks foreign language]
- How was your holiday?
- All right.
I'll grab your bag.
Did you get to see your sister
in Los Angeles?
Yeah, I did.
And how's she doing?
She's doing fine.
[laughing, chattering]
