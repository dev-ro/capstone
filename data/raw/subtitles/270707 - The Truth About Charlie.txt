(Male vocalist sings jazz tune)
(Speaking French)
Thank you, Charles.
(Charlie speaking French)
Careful!
Thank you, young man.
At your service, Madame.
Such a gentleman...
(Female vocalist sings mystical song)
I beg you, please. No!
Hercules, how could you
do that to me? I begged you.
I just couldn't resist.
You couldn't resist?
I don't believe it!
Sylvia, what am I gonna do?
How can I ever explain it to him?
Regina, break it gently,
then soak him for all he's worth.
I don't even care about the money.
REGGIE: All I ever wanted was someone--
JOSHUA: Excuse me.
JOSHUA: Does this belong to you?
SYLVIA: What's he gone and done?
He was creating a sophisticated
surveillance system...
behind the ladies' cabañas.
He's completely out of control.
It's all that nascent testosterone.
It's the scourge of the planet,
that stuff. Herky, sit.
-Thanks for not turning him in.
-Oh, you're welcome.
See you.
Quitter.
-What?
-Nothing.
You called me a quitter.
You give up awful easy.
(Fast-paced Arabic beat music plays)
Yeah. Hi.
Can I ask your name now that
we're in another country together?
-Regina Lambert.
-Joshua Peters.
REGGIE: Charmed.
I wanna ask you something quickly...
and make it like
ripping off a Band-Aid.
REGGIE: Go ahead.
JOSHUA: ls there a Mr. Regina?
-Not for long.
-Your ride didn't show?
Yeah. It's par for the course,
I'm afraid.
JOSHUA: Do you need a hand?
REGGIE: Yes.
REGGIE: Yes, that'd be great. Thank you.
(Soft piano music)
-I'd invite you in, but it's not--
-I get it.
Nice neighbourhood. Fancy.
(Car horn beeps)
I'm off.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
Good luck.
It was really nice meeting you, too.
Something to remember me by.
REGGIE: "Caribbean."
I've just come back from there....
I guess you'll have to read it.
Find out what you've missed.
(Several car horns honk)
Maybe next time you're in Martinique
you'll be single.
See you around, Reggie.
It's Regina, but that's okay.
REGGIE: Charles?
Honorine?
Charles!
(Slow, mysterious instrumental music plays)
(Music becomes more intense)
(Speaking in French)
Commandant Jeanne Dominique...
...of the Police Judiciaire.
This is Lieutenant Dessalines.
(Footsteps)
(Morgue attendant coughs repeatedly)
(Jazzy music plays)
This is your husband?
Monsieur Charles Lambert?
DOMINIQUE: Your husband's body
was found next to the train tracks...
just outside of Montpellier.
Were you aware of his departure
from France, Thursday?
REGGIE: Charles travels all the time.
His effects included a one-way
airline ticket from Barcelona...
to Caracas, Venezuela.
Also one to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Does he know anyone in Caracas?
ln Rio?
Your husband was American?
Wait, no. Charles is Swiss.
Was Swiss.
-His profession?
-Art dealer.
DOMINIQUE: Where is his gallery?
He did most of his work over
the telephone, on the computer....
-Okay. Family?
-I believe I'm all there is.
He was an orphan. An only child.
DOMINIQUE: Charles Lambert...
was a wealthy man?
We live.... Lived quite well.
Why did you say his name like that?
Is this your husband's passport?
I believe so.
REGGIE: Yes.
You see? Switzerla.nd.
Swiss.
And this?
DOMINIQUE: And this?
And this?
Perhaps I will have that ciggy.
Forgive me, but you are married
only three months?
-Is that illegal?
-And your marriage, a happy one?
I was about to ask Charles
for a divorce, if you must know.
I see.
DOMINIQUE: How many financial accounts
did you and your husband hold?
Why haven't you found
the killer yet?
Where are my belongings,
our furniture?
Why is my apartment empty?
Who tore it apart?
Your husband liquidated the contents
of your flat...
through three reputable auction
houses and cashed the proceeds...
roughly the equivalent
of $1 .8 million, immediately.
Madame, there is not a. tra.ce
of this money a.nywhere.
La. Direction Centra.Ie de la. Police
Judicia.ire is confident of this.
When we find the money,
we find the killer.
(Fast-paced dramatic instrumental music)
Search him.
(Morgue attendant speaking in French)
Stop! You're not permitted--
No. Nothing.
Okay, the cops don't have it,
and Charlie's clean.
Then who the hell's got it?
DOMINIQUE: One Hermès wallet
belonging to Charles Lambert...
containing 1,000 French francs,
1,500 deutsche marks...
$300 U.S., 5,000 pesetas,
$50 Caribbean...
the keys to Flat B....
(Women laughing)
DOMINIQUE: Your residence?
One trousse de toilette...
containing the usual items,
including one tube of Topol:
"The smoker's toothpolish."
-Yes.
-One letter stamped and sealed...
addressed to you.
Addressed to me?
My dear Regina:
Today I'm off to Cannes.
Got a lead on a couple of Renoirs,
maybe a Schnabel and a Basquiat.
Can't wait for your return.
Thought you might be amused
by the enclosed clipping.
Love, Cha.rles.
PS: The tailor called.
Your dress is ready.
-Show me the clipping.
-There was none included.
We took the liberty
of calling your tailor.
We felt perhaps
we'd learn something.
REGGIE: Did you?
DOMINIQUE: Yes.
Your dress is ready.
His a.genda..
Cha.rles La.mbert's la.st da.y wa.s busy.
To us, largely meaningless.
"It is your right, as next of kin...
"to claim the possessions
of the deceased at this time."
Et cetera. If you will sign.
Your cooperation today
will be noted.
REGGIE: Noted?
REGGIE: Comma.nda.nt, I mean,
do you actually believe...
I had something to do
with my husband's death?
Ma.da.me, I'm sorry,
but professionally...
I'm obliged
to accept that possibility.
(Upbeat pop song)
(Male vocalist sings upbeat Arabic pop song)
(Knocking on door)
JOSHUA: Regina?
Joshua.
Your husband....
Reggie, I'm so sorry.
You terrified me.
I'm sorry.
I saw it on the news tonight.
This is the most horrific day
of my life.
What a nightmare.
I've got to get out of here.
REGGIE: Next thing I know,
caution's been thrown to the winds.
We're a.t the Porta.bella.
retrospective in Berlin...
visiting his old friends...
in Uganda, Sarajevo, Montreal.
Impulse marriage
at the Chelsea Registry Office.
It was all so exciting,
so promising at first.
The whirlwind romance,
move to Paris.
And then....
Then it seems like
he's always off on business.
I'm mostly alone in this huge flat.
And now....
Now, I'm slightly drunk, I'm afraid.
-You're a good listener.
-No.
You're a good talker.
Have you ever been in love in Paris?
I can't say
that I've had that pleasure.
Well, you're still young.
-Maybe you still have a chance.
-That'd be nice.
(Soothing pop music)
REGGIE: Yes, a bed. Thank God.
(Reggie chuckles)
REGGIE: Thank you.
You are welcome.
JOSHUA: Sweet dreams, then.
REGGIE: What?
I'm gonna crash. Room 28,
second floor, if you need me.
Sleep well, okay?
REGGIE: Charles' bag.
JOSHUA: What?
Sorry.
Good night, Reggie.
It's Regina, you know.
Nobody calls me Reggie.
Nobody at all?
Not till now, anyway.
Good.
(Desk clerk speaking in French)
Mr. Peters...
...a package for you.
(Joshua speaking French)
Hold it for me, please?
My pleasure...
For me?
-Do something for me?
-Okay, I won't.
One moment, sir.
Sure thing.
May I ask what's up here?
(Speaking in French)
I'm curious...
...about your relationship with Mrs. Lambert.
Unfortunately, we don't have one.
I just met her.
Already you're moving her into your
hotel, tucking her in at night?
(Clicks her tongue disapprovingly)
It's kind of
a damsel-in-distress thing.
Yes, I know.
Slain husband, missing money.
-Cops breathing down her neck.
-Exactly.
And now the mysterious stranger.
Okay, fine. You're here on holiday?
Actually, I live here off and on.
She's a real beauty, isn't she?
I suppose she is, yes.
I always wonder
with a woman like that...
what kind of guy
actually gets to go to bed with her.
In this case, a dead one, I guess.
(Speaking in French)
Okay...
Surely you're not suspicious of her?
No.
-She just doesn't seem the type.
-Which type is that?
The murdering type?
(Speaking in French)
Monsieur, I thank you.
Anytime, Commandant.
Good evening.
(Female vocalist sings sultry tango)
(Knocking on door)
BARTHOLOMEW: I'll take that.
-Mr. Bartholomew?
-How do you do?
-Wait here, Pierre?
-Yes, sir.
Sorry our first meeting has to occur
under such unhappy circumstances.
We have a great deal to cover,
and I'm on a tight schedule today.
How are you holding up?
I'm bewildered,
to tell you the truth.
BARTHOLOMEW:
French police bothering you?
They think I had something to do
with this hideous--
We can't interfere there.
Not just now, anyway.
You'll have every protection
the U.S. has to offer.
Protecting British citizens?
lsn't that out of your jurisdiction?
BARTHOLOMEW: Your husband lent
his services to us at the O.D.C.
The what?
The most secure talk space
in town....
The O.D.C.
Office of Defense Cooperation.
We knew your husband
by his real name, Charlie Lake.
BARTHOLOMEW: Now, Mrs. Lake,
look at this photograph...
and tell me
if there's anyone you recognise.
BARTHOLOMEW: Have a good look.
REGGIE: Charles, of course.
BARTHOLOMEW: The other three?
Afraid not.
They worked with him
almost three years ago...
on an "operation" of
an extraordinarily "delicate" nature.
I "get it."
I need to assess
how precarious your situation is.
This gentleman who escorted you
to your hotel last night.
A friend, Joshua Peters.
He has nothing to do with this.
-How long have you known him?
-Actually, I just met him.
Oh, boy.
Look, I don't mean to be intrusive.
We don't know what Charlie was
up to, or who he was up to it with.
But we know $6 million
is a great amount of money--
$6 million?
-Is that what this is about?
-Correct.
I want to make it clear
even if we wanted to...
which we don't,
we couldn't force you to do it.
Your decision
must be entirely your own.
-What decision?
-To work with us.
If you think I'm getting involved,
you're absolutely bonkers.
-You're already involved, Mrs. Lake.
-Stop calling me that.
We want that money back,
Mrs. Lambert.
I don't have it.
Yes, you have it.
You just don't know you've got it.
A misplaced key
to a safe-deposit box...
a certified cheque
in tomorrow's mail...
a baggage claim ticket
tucked in a paperback.
If you look for it, you'll find it.
You may not have
a great deal of time, either.
People in that photo
know you got it...
just as surely as we do.
You won't be safe
until that money is in our hands.
Is tha.t clea.r?
Here's my direct cell line.
Don't lose it.
Call me any time, day or night.
And this is crucial:
You mustn't betray the
confidentiality of this dialogue.
You must not tell anyone
about coming to see me.
Certainly. No problem.
I promise you.
It's clear that you're a decent person.
It's a rare quality, nowadays.
Tough situation you're in here.
I feel for you.
God bless.
DOMINIQUE: His agenda.
Charles Lambert's last day was busy.
To us, la.rgely mea.ningless.
REGGIE: 12.:00.
8, rue des Rosiers, Cligna.ncourt.
The flea. ma.rket.
(French rap music plays)
(Music stops)
Twenty-four.
Four. Okay.
Nine. So, then it must be....
Regina, right?
My name is Lola.
I knew your husband.
I see.
So, were you Charlie's trophy
or his partner?
Do you know what I'm talking about
when I say "Operation Verify"?
How about this:
46 Eppler-cut diamonds.
Believe it or not, Lola,
I don't want that money.
Okay, so you know about it,
you just don't want it.
-I see.
-I may be the only one...
but that's how it is.
Charlie ripped off
some very dangerous people.
I don't know anything about
my husband's business interests.
-I thought you said--
-I don't mean to be rude.
-Don't be.
-Are you finished?
Not quite.
See, your husband messed us up...
something fierce.
Regina, am I getting through to you
at all here?
JOSHUA: Reggie?
LOLA: Regina!
We earned that money.
We wa.nt it.
We deserve it.
JOSHUA: Are you all right?
Was that woman giving you a hard time?
REGGIE: You could say that. Yes, she was.
Joshua, what are you doing here?
I can't believe this. I saw you
get in your cab, back in town.
I followed.
Almost lost you a couple of times.
Just caught up in time
to see you coming here.
I really do seem to be caught up
in a terrible mess.
Why are you here? ln this place?
I don't understand.
A notation in Charles's date book,
"8, rue des Rosiers."
I'm trying to make sense
of his last day.
The places that he went to.
REGGIE: It's not just
that he was murdered.
There's all this other money.
Government money
tha.t's gone missing.
And there are other people
who want it.
And that man is one of them.
So was the woman in the alley.
(Soft instrumental music)
(Desk clerk speaks to Joshua in French)
I'll get my messages, then I'll get
that stuff from my room.
JOSHUA: I'll meet you upstairs?
REGGIE: Okay.
(Man breathing heavily)
Have a good look.
I think you have something
that belongs to me.
In here?
REGGIE: Joshua!
ZADAPEC: Wait!
REGGIE: Get your filthy--
ZADAPEC: I just want to open the bag!
JOSHUA: Reggie?
(Struggling and grunting)
JOSHUA: Go!
REGGIE: Wait!
JOSHUA: Go.
Greetings!
Same to you.
Any fresh mint?
Certainly.
(Cell phone rings)
Excuse me.
-Hello?
-Mr. Bartholomew?
REGGIE: They're here. I sa.w them.
The ones in the photo.
Describe them to me, Mrs. Lambert.
(Drum rolls)
Emil Zadapec.
Il-Sang Lee.
Lola Jansco.
BARTHOLOMEW: All very da.ngerous,
highly ca.pa.ble individua.Is.
It's absolutely imperative
that I see you as soon as possible.
JOSHUA: Reggie?
Coming! I've got to go.
-Please use extreme caution.
-Yes, I will. I promise.
JOSHUA: Everything all right?
REGGIE: What about you?
JOSHUA: Might be a bit wrinkled.
REGGIE: My dress.
JOSHUA: You okay now?
REGGIE: I'm still shaking.
REGGIE: What happened? What did you do?
JOSHUA: Nothing much.
JOSHUA: I don't think
he'll be bothering you anymore.
How are you doing?
You know what's wrong with you?
What?
Absolutely nothing.
(Romantic instrumental music plays)
I feel a little funny about this.
My kisses are funny?
JOSHUA: No.
Are you hungry?
JOSHUA: Great.
REGGIE: I'm starving.
JOSHUA: I got lots to eat.
REGGIE: I'm gonna shower first.
JOSHUA: Okay.
Just make yourself at home, okay?
JOSHUA: Reggie?
How'd you know
about those people today?
REGGIE: What?
JOSHUA: Those three.
And the missing money?
Where did you find out
about all that?
Shoot.
REGGIE: Look....
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
I promised.
Promised? Who?
I'm sorry.
I want you to hear this.
It's Aznavour. You know him?
(Speaking in French)
-Shoot the Pia.no Pla.yer, right?
-Exactly.
(Charles Aznavour sings romantic ballad)
(Telephone rings)
-Hello?
-Hello, Mrs. Lambert.
Don't ha.ng up on me.
Look, I'm sorry about the elevator.
REGGIE: I have nothing to say.
JOSHUA: Reggie?
ZADAPEC: We must talk.
JOSHUA: Who is it?
-The guy from the elevator.
-Give me the phone.
Wait, is that Dyle there?
REGGIE: Who?
ZADAPEC: Mr. Dyle?
Has he laid his "Charles Aznavour"
routine on you yet?
What's he saying?
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, nobody wants to hurt you.
JOSHUA: What did he say?
ZADAPEC: All we want is what's ours,
and we know that you have it.
Dyle's not to be trusted.
He wa.nts your money.
He'll do a.nything.
What did he say?
If I don't give him the money,
he'll kill me.
Why would he kill you? He's just
saying it to scare you, that's all.
-If they think you have the money--
-Then why is Charles dead?
He obviously knew
where that money is.
Listen, I'm on your side.
I wish you'd tell me what you know,
promises or no promises.
I could be of some help.
I think you'd better go, Joshua.
I'm afraid I've lost my appetite.
I'm very tired.
I understand. It's been a long day.
Please, I really need to think.
JOSHUA: Just remember, I'm on your side.
REGGIE: Yeah.
(Fast-paced rhythmic drumbeat)
You people want to get rich or not?
Don't get all rhetorical on us now.
Answer my question!
Rich or not rich?
Does she have the money
or not, Dyle?
-I think she does.
-Here's my problem.
You say there was nothing
with Charlie in the train...
his bags, clothes, whatever.
But size up, Dyle. It's all smoke.
You got zero credibility here.
You're right.
I already got what I want.
Yet I choose to subject myself
to this bullshit anyway.
You just want
to get in her pants, anyway.
I'm not touching your psychodrama
in the elevator just now...
-and your crazed little phone call.
-You know what, Dyle?
One more little crazed phone call...
this time to the Paris Police,
and they have Charlie Lake's killer, no?
Right?
ZADAPEC: Don't forget that, the next time
you come waltzing in here.
Don't forget that for a minute.
All high and mighty,
like you're God's gift to us.
Zad?
He's right, buddy.
No more loose cannon stuff, okay?
We are stuck with him for now.
And he is stuck with us.
Cool, Zad?
Okay, maniac?
The only way this works is if she
trusts me. Lose that, end of story.
Hey, Zadapec,
your phone call really spooked her.
I want you to tell me
exactly what you said.
Well, you're not gonna like it.
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew?
Are you there, Mr. Ba.rtholomew?
(Reggie screams)
-What's going on?
-Mr. Bartholomew.
-Yes.
-Who is Dyle?
What about Dyle?
-The man in the elevator.
-Zadapec?
-He called Joshua Peters "Dyle."
-Zadapec called Peters "Dyle"?
-Tell me about him.
-Dyle?
-Now.
-Okay, all right.
BARTHOLOMEW: Okay, Carson J. Dyle.
Ma.jor, Specia.I Forces.
Highly decorated in the Gulf War,
Mogadishu.
Then he drops out.
Head-honchos Global Options...
the top-drawer service outfit of
the '90s, till his untimely demise.
-Demise?
-Death.
I know what demise means,
Mr. Bartholomew.
Carson Dyle was terminated in 1998
by Eastern European militia...
near the former Yugoslavian border,
40 kilometres east of Sarajevo.
No, wait!
Dyle worked with Charles?
He knew Charles?
Unfortunately for Dyle, yes.
In '98, Dyle mounted
a special ops unit...
for a high-level, covert hostage
extraction on behalf of the O.D.C.
In those da.ys...
the O.D.C. couldn't dea.I directly
with outside contra.ctors.
Tha.t's where your Cha.rlie La.ke ca.me in.
He wa.s a.n independent fa.cilita.tor.
The O.D.C. would put him on
the resea.rch pa.yroll...
for a. Iimited time.
He would book the professiona.Is,
negotia.te with the a.dversa.ries...
wra.ngle a.Il the slimy deta.ils.
Your husba.nd brokered the dea.I
to go in...
tra.nsfer the a.ssets,
a.nd get our ma.n out.
Keep going. I'm with you.
BARTHOLOMEW: The unit choppered in,
a.ccompa.nied by La.ke...
tra.nsporting $6 million...
in interna.Ily fla.wless
Eppler-cut dia.monds a.s ra.nsom.
They were a.mbushed
shortly a.fter la.nding.
Dyle and most of the Global Options
team were totally decimated.
Cut to ribbons. Never had a chance.
Your husband
and the three from the photo...
were the only ones
to make it out alive.
We believe those four
stashed the diamonds...
with plans to return
and claim them for themselves.
How did Charles manage to--
They lied during the inquiry
and waited.
We believe Charlie Lake broke from
his agreement with the others...
recovered the diamonds on his own,
and completely vanished.
REGGIE: And maybe Carson Dyle lived.
BARTHOLOMEW: Trust me, Mrs. Lambert.
Carson Dyle is dead.
You've got to find out what you can
about your new friend Peters...
or Dyle, or whatever his name is.
We need to know
how he fits into the equa.tion.
Mr. Bartholomew,
I already told you my great goal...
is for far less involvement
in this sordid mess, not more!
I was wrong about you, Mrs. Lambert.
Meeting the widow
of a man like Lake?
I was expecting...
a siren, a harpy, a shrew.
But you ha.ve decency, dignity...
what my father
used to call gumption.
I'm very touched.
You are actually quite sweet
for a stars-and-bars company man.
You've discovered my secret side,
Mrs. Lambert.
Keep it under your ha.t.
Boo!
(Latin-reggae music plays)
(Joshua whistles)
(ln French)
Have you seen Mrs. Lambert?
She already left the hotel, sir.
She left this for you, Mr. Peters.
Aznavour.
(Cab driver in French)
That's him, Miss?
(Reggie in French)
He's the one.
(Latin-reggae music plays)
(Phone rings)
(ln French)
Could I speak to a Mr. Dyle?
STORE MANAGER: ls he an American?
REGGIE: Yes, he is.
STORE MANAGER: One moment, please.
I'll try to find out.
(Manager in French)
Mr. Dyle?
-Yes.
-It's for you, sir.
My God. You are Dyle!
JOSHUA: Reggie?
REGGIE: It's the only name I've got!
JOSHUA: We need to ta.Ik.
REGGIE: I've never been so betrayed...
and humiliated in all my life!
I had to confirm
you weren't involved.
You had to make sure
I wasn't involved?
JOSHUA: No, that's not what I meant.
(Speaking in French)
Your package, Mr. Dyle.
But of course, sir.
You're meant to be dead.
I do owe you an explanation.
Reggie, my name is Alexander Dyle.
Carson was my brother.
Shake hands. How do you do?
You have got to be joking!
JOSHUA: Reggie!
REGGIE: It's Regina!
JOSHUA: I can explain everything!
REGGIE: Monsieur Philippe!
JOSHUA: Reggie, wait!
Now to the station, please.
JOSHUA: Please, you got to listen to me!
Thank you for waiting, Monsieur.
JOSHUA: Charles and the three people
following you....
They betrayed Carson. They stole
the money he was entrusted with.
I'm trying to get to the truth
by conspiring with them.
How noble of you
to embrace their techniques.
I'm sorry, really,
about your brother and everything...
but give me a break.
I hate
that you're caught up in this.
But at the same time I'm glad,
because it means that we've met.
I liked Joshua Peters.
And now he's gone.
(Tense, rhythmic instrumental music plays)
(Speaking in French)
I didn't know Charles was married.
His wife said Charles didn't have a mother.
(Speaking in French)
One-way to London...
...the 1 1 :20, please.
Stay here in Paris, Reggie. With me.
Don't buy that ticket.
What do you think?
(French rap music plays)
(Speaking in French)
My ticket, please.
A round-trip to London, please.
ANNOUNCER: (Over loudspeaker)
This is the la.st ca.Il.
Did you mean
what you said in the taxi?
Everything. Which part?
The part about that you're really...
glad that you met me
or something like that.
Deeply.
That's sweet...
Alex.
But I'm still going to London.
Wait.
No, you're not.
You're not going anywhere, Reggie.
JOSHUA: Reggie?
(lndistinct French chatter)
(Breathes laboriously)
Cardiac arrest.
Sudden death syndrome.
Our prelimina.ry forensic report.
And nobody wa.nts to offer me
a. more complica.ted expla.na.tion?
Oka.y.
Regina?
A word with you alone.
The rest ofyou ma.y lea.ve.
Comma.nda.nt, I was hoping
to remain here with ma.da.me Lambert.
You, especially, Monsieur,
may leave.
I was hoping
that I could be of some assistance.
(Says good-bye in French)
JOSHUA: It's okay.
You said yesterday
that your husband was an orphan.
An only child.
That's right.
A woman showed up at the morgue
early this morning...
from the provinces, Rully.
She identified
your husband's corpse...
as her unmarried son...
Cha.rles du La.c.
Du Lac?
REGGIE: Du Lac.
Lake, Charlie Lake.
The old woman said
her husband beat her son...
and her without mercy every day...
until one evening the father fell
to his death from a bedroom window.
Fourteen-year-old Charles
left home the next day.
She's seen him only occasionally
in the years since then.
Why are you telling me all this?
DOMINIQUE:
The woma.n seemed quite dera.nged.
(Speaking in French)
"The lights are off
all over the house."
DOMINIQUE: I worry for her.
She's convinced you are responsible
for her son's death...
the missing money.
Well, there should be a club.
Unfortunately, she's already
on a train back to Rully.
Regina, I trust you.
You're not a. suspect here.
But I do believe
you can lead us to the killer.
And I very much want your help.
Comma.nda.nt....
Please, Regina, call me Jeanne.
(Speaking in French)
May I have a smoke, Jeanne?
Of course.
I trust you, too.
You will cooperate?
If it means
getting to the truth, yes.
I understand.
Exactly what kind of cooperation
did you have in mind, Jeanne?
Whatever it takes to help us
find out everything possible...
about your mysterious Mr. Peters
and his friends.
Whatever it takes?
I'm asking you to find out
everything you can, Regina.
Open up. Dig deep.
Just be...very, very careful.
REGGIE: Okay, everybody.
The moment
you've a.Il been wa.iting for.
LOLA: Charlie's last day.
REGGIE: You, too, Alex. Dive in.
LOLA: Okay, here's Charlie's letter.
(Sombre instrumental music plays)
You satisfied?
(French song plays over radio)
Tell us about Sarajevo, Mrs. Lake.
REGGIE: Sarajevo?
How did you know about....
I mentioned you told me
a little about your travels.
BARTHOLOMEW: Mrs. La.mbert...
Carson Dyle was terminated in 1998
by Eastern European militia...
near the former Yugoslavian border,
40 kilometres east of Sarajevo.
JOSHUA: You've got nothing to hide, Regina.
You can tell them about Sarajevo.
What about Sarajevo?
Tell us about your border crossings,
customs checks...
any chance encounters.
We need to know
everything about Sarajevo.
Okay.
I'll start from the beginning.
Very good, Mrs. Lake.
(Music with tribal drums plays)
Is that table reserved for them?
They don't know about this place.
You didn't tell them
we were coming?
No.
Unlike everything else about us,
what I confided in you...
et cetera....
Reggie, what did the cop want
when she asked you to stay?
She doesn't seem
to like you very much, Alex.
Am I still allowed to kiss you?
Yeah.
That's nice.
Really nice.
JOSHUA: There's one other thing.
Which is?
I told them it was me
who killed Charles.
Why would you say
a terrible thing like that?
Okay, Reggie,
I'm gonna ask you again.
This person you don't want
to tell me about.
What do they know about Charles?
I don't want to play
that game anymore.
I don't want to play
any games anymore:
I never break a promise.

I've really gotten to like you.
I think you're very special.
REGGIE: Yeah, I'm sure.
REGGIE: Now, can I have that money?
LOLA: Right. So, hand it over.
I couldn't sta.nd you when
I first met you.
I thought you were so stuck up.
But now I've got a. crush on you.
Shucks, girl!
Watch out for Dyle, Regina.
I mean it.
-Putting in some overtime?
-I see I'm not the only one.
(Singing) Deception

(ln French)
It's her! Assassin!!
She killed my son!
Adulterer!! She killed my son!!
REGGIE: No!
Lola?
Regina...
Dyle....
Lola, you hold on.
-There's help coming.
-Dyle....
No, Lola.
He didn't really kill Charles.
He just told you that, I promise.
Dyle....
REGGIE: (Sobbing) No!
We were entitled
to a share of those diamonds...
after what we went through...
Mrs. La.ke.
REGGIE: She said, "Dyle."
That's the last thing she said.
-Reggie, l....
-Yeah.
And in the club she said,
"Watch out for Dyle."
JOSHUA: Reggie.
REGGIE: Alex...
why have you never gone
to the police with your suspicions?
Your brother's death?
Those three? Charles?
I guess I want that money, too.
This is very illuminating.
I'll see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
It's Saturday.
Charlie's last day.
Good night.
Good night, Reggie.

REGGIE: I know.
DOMINIQUE: Why didn't I think of tha.t?

Let's go up there and take a look.
-Fancy meeting you here.
-Hi.
You find what
you're looking for, Alex?
Reggie, you've found something,
haven't you?
JOSHUA: Well, well, well.
The gang's all here.
Wha.t's left of it, a.nywa.y.
(ln French)
Do you speak English?
Yes, just a little.
Also some Japanese...

This empty space--what is it?
DEALER PROPHETE:
Tragic history, Monsieur.
Mr. Hyppolite's place.
He made a great fortune last week.
He was retiring.
Going to see the world.
Next day...
he was dead.
What did he sell?
Hector...
he traded in postage stamps.
SANG: Stamps?
DEALER PROPHETE: Yes. The collectors...
called him...
"The Seeker."
He could find a.nything for you...
if you could afford.
Stamps?
(Mystical music plays)
(Fast-paced rhythmic music plays)
What's he doing, Reggie?
Where's he going?
JOSHUA: Where's he going?
REGGIE: I don't know! Alex...
get your hands off me.
JOSHUA: Stamps!
REGGIE: What are you doing?
Reggie, where is it?
Where's Charlie's bag?
JOSHUA: Where is it?
REGGIE: What?
The envelope!
The stamps!
(Fast-paced rhythmic music continues)
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
The subway! To your left!
JOSHUA: Watch out!
(Fast-paced French rock music plays)
(Car horns beeping)

Anybody here?
REGGIE: Where is everybody?
Hello?
(Phone ringing)
(Gasps in horror)
(Thunder cracks)
(Banging and clanging coming

(French rap music plays)
It's not here, is it?
REGGIE: You killed him.
-Of course I didn't.
-You're a murderer!
JOSHUA: Reggie!
Reggie, don't be ridiculous!
(French rap music continues)
(Joshua pounds on door
and Reggie screams)
(Woman sings slow, melancholy song)
JOSHUA: Reggie, wait!
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew!
-It's okay, you're safe now.
-Are you armed, Mr. Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW: At all times.
REGGIE: Thank God!
JOSHUA: This is convenient.
REGGIE: This is him!
Joshua Peters, Alexander Dyle,
whoever he is!
BARTHOLOMEW: You have the assets?
JOSHUA: Wait a minute.
The assets?
Reggie, is this who you've been--
No. Yes!
BARTHOLOMEW: So, my long lost
and nonexistent kid brother, Alex...
a..k.a....
Mr. Bartholomew.
Nice to meet you.
No.
JOSHUA: I've never seen a ghost before.
Pleasure's all mine.
REGGIE: What's going on here?
JOSHUA: Reggie...
my name is Lewis Bartholomew.
Really?
I'm a special investigator for the
U.S. Office of Defense Cooperation.
Really?
Your secret partner here
is the real Dyle.
Carson Dyle.
Mrs. Lambert, I am Carson Dyle.
Obviously, I didn't die
in Yugoslavia.
Came mighty close, though.
When I asked you about Dyle,
you were describing yourself.
That's correct, Mrs. Lambert.
BARTHOLOMEW: I was shot up pretty bad.
Totally incapacitated.
(Machine guns firing and men yelling)
ZADAPEC: Check on Dyle!
BARTHOLOMEW: Unlike the others,
Cha.rlie knew I wa.s still a.Iive.
CHARLIE: He's dead!
LOLA: Chief!
SANG: Chief!
BARTHOLOMEW:
But he told them I wa.s dea.d.
Dyle is dead!
(Machine gun fires rapidly)
BARTHOLOMEW:
He took the money a.nd ra.n.
A fa.rmer a.nd his fa.mily found me.
He was a Muslim,
his wife, Christian.
They hid me, got me to a hospital...
where a great little lady doc
put me back together.
And you've been tracking
Charlie Lake ever since.
I located him in Paris,
reinvented as Charles Lambert.
He got wind of you?
I always told myself I'd give
Charlie the benefit of the doubt.
I wouldn't kill him
if he gave back the money.
So long as he didn't lie.
And you did kill him?
He did lie.
REGGIE: Charles never told the truth
about anything.
None of you do!
JOSHUA: So, Dyle...
I'm moved that you want
the O.D.C. to get their money back.
I always complete my assignments.
JOSHUA: But we still don't have
the missing funds...
and you've got blood
all over your hands.
Is your intention to arrest me?
Look!
One of eight known remaining...
inverted U.S. Teddy Nickels,
X.F. grade, 1928.
The legendary Algerian Oran 60.
Original slash mark intact, 1952.
And the true masterpiece...
the mahogany Urate Lornis,
Madagascar, 1906.
The most valuable postage stamp
on the face of the earth.
BARTHOLOMEW: There you are, investigator.
My work is done.
Just hand that over now, Reggie.
It's U.S. government property.
Reggie.
(Bartholomew laughs)
I don't believe you just did that.
I do.
DOMINIQUE: Carson Dyle?
DESSALINES: Police!
(French police shout)
(Military drum roll)
You look like hell, ll-Sang Lee.
Here for you, chief.
JOSHUA: Carson.
Mr. Dyle!
Question, okay?
You didn't happen
to bump into Zadapec...
on the 1 1 :20 to London yesterday,
did you?
ZADAPEC: Check on Dyle!
CHARLIE: Dyle is dea.d!
ZADAPEC: Chief!
LOLA: Chief!
CHARLIE: He's dea.d!
(Zadapec screams)
That is correct.
I see.
Were you outside the Tango Palace
when Lola bought it?
LOLA: Chief!
Go!
(Tyres screeching)
That was most unfortunate.
You've lost a lot.
None of it's coming back.
What's your point, Bartholomew?
JOSHUA: You still have your honour, Carson.
I've got a suggestion.
Tony!
Eric!
JOSHUA: Put them down!
(Haunting Arabic music plays)
Chief.
-See you in court, Comma.nda.nt.
-It will be my pleasure.
You are under arrest
for the murder of Charles Lambert.
(Slow guitar music plays)
Shit.
(Music picks up tempo)
JOSHUA: 'Morning, Ernie.
Good morning, Mr. Bartholomew.
Here are your messages.
Your mum called.
Hey, is that for me?
Is everything okay, Mr. B.?
Ms. Hoskins.
MS. HOSKINS: Yes, sir?
Some tea, please.
MS. HOSKINS: Coming right up, sir.
JOSHUA: Thank you.
Hey, boss.
How are you, chief?
JOSHUA: Good job, guys.

ODC OFFICIAL #1 :
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew.
She's okay.
JOSHUA: Come in, please.
REGGIE: Well, well, well.

JOSHUA: You can call me Lewis.
This is for you, Lewis.
My late husband's minor fortune.
-But before? The fire?
-Laser copies.

(Joshua chuckles)
Thank you, Reggie.
-I'm not a thief.
-I know.
So long, Lewis.
Quitter!
-You give up awful easy, don't you?
-Not really.
Please...
don't go.
I ha.ted deceiving you. I'm so sorry.
Please.
All that time,
you should have trusted me.
Revealing my true identity
was never an option, Reggie.
But I never tried
to hide my feelings for you.
Lewis, what are you really like?
There's only one way to find out.
Why should l?
Because I love you.
What?
I love you, Reggie.
You've got to be kidding.
No, never.
-You're luckier than you realise.
-Why?
Because I was about to walk out
of your life for good...
REGGIE: and the crazy thing is....
JOSHUA: Yes?
I would have regretted that
for several weeks probably.
(Singing) It's the devil a.nd hell
Sha.ring ga.mes tha.t we pla.y
But it's hea.ven a.s well
Tha.t the gods send our wa.y
When you love me
An eclipse of the moon
As we storm on the sa.nds
It's the wild ocea.n spume
Come to die in your ha.nds
When you love me
For you touch every sense
With your body on mine
So in tune a.nd intense
As we brea.thlessly climb
Okay. Who did that to you?
Splendor
When you love me
It's the cry in the night
Ofyour loving la.ment
Dying soft in the light
When a.Il pa.ssion is spent
In thejoy ofsurrender
