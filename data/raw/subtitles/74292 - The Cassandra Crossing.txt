The Emergency Room
is on the other side. De l'autre...
No, man, no!
(Strained breathing)
Thank God you're here.
(Phone buzzes )
Yes, sir.
Yes, he's just arrived.
lt's for you.
He'll be right with you.
Sir. Yes, sir.
l'm on the scene, sir.
l realise that.
Don't worry. l'll handle it.
Can l speak to the doctor in charge?
l'm Dr Stradner.
Mackenzie.
lt's crucial you tell us everything
you know about this disease.
- We're quite at a loss as to...
- Know who he is? Nationality?
We've guessed. Swedish or Norwegian.
- You haven't questioned him?
- As to how he's feeling?
Try him, Stack.
Listen again, fella.
(Speaks Swedish)
(Swedish)
Doctor, shouldn't you
be doing something in there?
(Doctor) What can you tell me
about the bacteria?
- l thought you'd diagnosed it.
- A contagious pneumonic plague.
lf that's true,
there is no known antidote.
And if the American Government
was housing this bacterial strain
inside the lnternational
Health Organisation,
it contravenes UN Resolution 816...
..which forbids bacterial agents.
We were trying to destroy it.
Odd that you should pick a foreign
country in which to experiment.
Listen, Doctor,
if some half-mad terrorist group
hadn't tried to blow up this place,
we wouldn't be in this mess.
You're not in a mess, Mr Mackenzie.
lt's lucky no-one else was exposed,
no-one else is infecting
half of Europe -
then you'd have your mess,
instead of this embarrassment.
Try him again, Stack.

Good trip, Herman.
Stand clear. Pardon.
(Questioning continues in Swedish)
Fill in Staff Headquarters

We'll work out of your office

We can't risk starting a panic.
That's right. He had a friend.
First class, Father?
We're not allowed to go first class.
Stockholm, please.
First class is fairly empty.
Here, Father. No extra charge.
l'll be going first as well, Jean,

- How about a fine Zippo lighter?
- Fully guaranteed.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
Come on, baby. Get a drink.
Come on, lago. lt's a long trip.
Get some water.
Oh, to hell with you!
l'll have the body taken
to the autopsy lab.
No, Doctor.
The crime was committed on the

His fate is our jurisdiction.
- Fate?
- Burn him.

Black olives and a large Wild Turkey
on the rocks for No.1 1 .
- Yes, Madame.
- Thank you.
lt's open.
- On the bed will be fine.
- Me or the tray?
l'd heard you'd gotten a new job.
Congratulations.
Travel is so broadening. You run
into the most unexpected people.
l should be flattered
by your effort to see me.
The celebrated Dr Chamberlain
is accepting his Strasbourg prize.
The same Dr Chamberlain who wet his
pants watching planes fly in movies.
You had to be on this train.
You've gained a few pounds.
Must be the fat of the land
you're living on.
You're not doing badly yourself.
l noticed your latest book
made the bestseller list...just.
Each new divorce from you
gives me inspiration.
Ah, that's why you're here.
Renewed inspiration.
Well, darling, l'd love to oblige,
but we can't have a third divorce
without going through
a third marriage.
- My manager would say no.
- l never asked for alimony.
- You kept the rings.
- You threw yours at me.
l've already finished another book.
l'd love to read it...
when l've time.
Don't worry. You will.
Jenny, say what you've come to say
and leave me alone, will you?
- l didn't come to say anything.
- Then why did you come?
l don't really know.
To take a look, perhaps.
lt's too cold to drop my pants.
Don't be crude.
lt doesn't fit your new image.
lt's not a new image.
You're the one
who's keeping up the image.
You used to like that image.
Just go, Jennifer, will you?
Let us stop this harrying,
thrust and lunging, and just go.
Ciao.
(Machine bleeps )
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
Won't you sit down, please?
l know you're not thrilled
to be here. l'm not happy either.
But l need your help.
Let me brief you on the situation.
He may be
on the Transcontinental Express
which is going to Stockholm.
We've tried contacting the train,
with no success. lf he lS on it,
l need your best advice,
so we know how to play it.
There's only one way, General.
Colonel.
Remove the patient
and isolate him.
That seems to make a lot of sense,
but suppose he's talking
to other passengers?
There's a thousand people
on that train, Doctor.
Just how many isolation rooms
do you have? Excuse me.
We've covered the airports.
Nothing.
Here are the local hospital reports.
- Zero, Colonel.
- Looks like he's on that train.
- Where's your vector control?
- lt's on monitor, sir.
Assuming they're running on
schedule, they should be about...
there, sir. Halfway to Basel.
Will you lift me up, please?
Katerina.
Leave the gentleman alone.
Why don't you read
a comic book? OK, sweets?
Here are the reports
you asked for, sir.
- Any news from the train?
- No reply, Colonel.
Can't we simply stop the train
and remove the patient?
Doctor...read that.
Get me Traffic Control in Basel.
No civilised country in Europe
will let us unload that train,
including the Swiss.
So much for neutrality.
l can't really blame them.
lt's not their disease.
What's holding up Basel?
(lncidental music covers sound)
(Knock on door)
lt's open.
Oh.
An arm bone, seven letters,
beginning with H.
Humerus.
- l'm being perfectly serious.
- So am l.
Humerus. H-U-M-E-R-U-S.
Oh. That's right.
Humerus.
- Finished already?
- Halfway through.
Bet you can't wait to see
how it turns out.
lt borders on being slanderous,
you know.
Famous doctor sues ex-wife
over unauthorised biography.
Vicious court battle.
- That should drive up sales.
- Won't need my help for that.
lt's a basic scientific principle -
hot air rises.
How about the part when you save me
from drowning in Central Park Lake?
At least it's accurate.
l forgot to mention
l only fell in three feet of water.
Ah, but you were shorter then.
l tried not to let
my prejudice come through.
lt's a portrait of a young,
idealistic doctor,
who after years
of dependence on his wife's money,
makes an important discovery.
He becomes rich and callous,
kicks his wife out,
and becomes a weak,
shallow monster.
No, none of your prejudice
sneaked through(!)
You did read it all.
lt's not such a bad book, is it?
There is a lot of love in it.
lt's a good book, Jenny,
only l wish you hadn't thought
that character was me.
You used to be so glorious.
Maybe you forgot.
Maybe l did.
Why, Dr Hippocrates,
is this the new bedside manner?
Just for once in your life,
shut up.
lt won't work, you know.
l'm still going to publish it.
Upset because l saw through
your little game?
That's the trouble with you and l.
We have played so many games,
we don't know what's real.
l was just...
Don't. You might really mean it,
and then l'd never know for sure.
Shit! l did it again.
(Baby cries )
Light me, baby.
Haven't you finished
that damn thing yet?
- Come on. We'll be late for lunch.
- Go and see about lago, would you?
Must be draughty in the baggage car.
He's fine. At least HE's eating.
Mmm. Then after, we'll have lunch.
l don't see any reason
to check on him every hour.
He's a dog. What does that make me?
Perhaps the conductor would do it.
l'm not a piece of luggage
you check through.
- Don't be so dramatic.
- l'm hungry now and l want to eat.
Come here.
- Now, dammit!
- Come here.
You're such a beautiful baby.
l don't mean to make you angry.
You love it.
l love you, baby, you!
(Knock on door)
Oh, excuse me, Madame Dressler.
Thank goodness you knocked.
Now, why don't you make yourself
nice and comfortable?
- What about lago?
- Never mind lago. Mmm!
Are you all right?
l'm a doctor...
Are you sure you're all right?
Wild Turkey on the rocks, please.
- Herman Kaplan.
- Jonathan Chamberlain.
And some black olives.
l notice you do not wear a watch.
l have a fine one which is for sale.
On the contrary,
l've got a very fine...
l hope you will not take offence.
l hope you will not take my watch.
Thank you.
Dr Chamberlain, your table is ready.
OK. See you inside.
We can take them past Basel,
Nuremberg and on into Poland.
l know, sir.
l know it's a Warsaw Pact country,
but l think we can handle it.
Besides, it's the nearest
available choice.
Then there's the problem of housing
a thousand people in quarantine.
There is a way of putting it, sir.
By keeping alive the sense of
urgency without levelling with them.
Mind you,
it's just a contingency plan.
The railroad line
hasn't been used for years,
but the Polish Government
says it's been checked regularly.
We can bring them into Janov
over the Kasundruv Bridge -
what they call
the Cassandra Crossing.
Potatoes, Sister, or rice?
Rice, please.
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.
- Don't you say grace?
- Katerina!
You said enough for all of us.
l must confess, Dr Chamberlain,
your name is so famous
and yet l really don't know why.
l wouldn't want to bore you...
Then don't. God forbid
we should both bore her.
You were saying?
l developed a process
to rejuvenate defective brain cells
in retarded children.
Oh, you see, darling.
There's hope for you yet!
(Machine bleeps )
(Clears throat)
Conductor, when do we get to Basel?
l'm the radio operator.
OK, radio operator,
when do we get to Basel?
ln half an hour.
- See? We do have time.
- Yes, we do.
(Phone bleeps )
Tell me.
(Major) Mm-hmm.
- Madame Hugo Dressler. Goddammit!
- Hugo Dressler?
Wife of the arms billionaire.
He'll raise a stink.
lnterpol reports a heroin peddler
on the train.
What about the radio operator?
Where's the chopper?
- Give me Central Air Control.
- Oh, my God.
Jonathan Chamberlain is aboard.
ls that good news?
Maybe.
He's a brilliant neurosurgeon.
Right. The chopper's airborne, sir.
- Have them stand by.
- We'll get back to them.
Well, Major, Doctor,
at least we've got
every option wired.
''Whirlwind 297 to Control.
''Turning now and heading 210.''
One whole entire half hour to Basel.
We might as well have started as
the train rolled into the station.
(Man) Just lay off, will you?
l'd better go wash up.
Gracious!
(Screams )
Hey, what the...?
lago will be so grateful.
Doctor, do you mind?
l wasn't quite finished.
- Will this be some compensation?
- Thank you.
Jonathan,
l have to speak to you.
You've been hiding someone from us.
- My ex-wife. Madame Dressler.
- Hello.
RJ Navarro. How do you do?
- Now.
- lt'll have to wait.
lt's a long trip.
You bet, but not to where you think.
Oh, another one of our hunches?
My wife believes in hunches.
She had a hunch
l was the right man for her.
We've been divorced twice
and still l can't get rid of her!
We're not headed for Basel
and the police are preventing
anyone else getting on this train.
Dr Chamberlain, radio telephone.
lt's urgent.
Will you excuse me? Order some
more champagne. l'll be right back.
l wonder what's going on.
Oh, don't be alarmed, darling.
Just a simple love spat. So crude.
''That's gotta be it.
''Whirlwind 297 to Control.
We've established visual contact.''
lf this turns out to be something,
you can belt me.
You bet l will!
Hey, Conductor, there's a pervert...
l don't like first class so far!
Pardon. Pardon. Pardon.
Le Docteur Chamberlain est arrivé.
Dr Chamberlain?
- Yes.
- ''This is Colonel Mackenzie,
''United States Army lntelligence
''at the lnternational
Health Organisation.''
What can l do for you?
Listen carefully.
There's a plague carrier aboard.
l repeat, a plague carrier.
Pneumonic plague.
''Dr Chamberlain,
this is Dr Stradner.''
- He contracted it at Geneva.
- l'll do it. He's in his late 20s,
''medium height, Swedish.
''He'll be bloated, sweating,
if he's not a corpse.''
- Oh, my God.
- Have you seen him?
Yes, yes.
Colonel, your man
is on board the train.
He is alive,
at least he was an hour ago.
Alive? Well, then find him, Doctor.
- But his friend died more than...
- Find him, Dr Chamberlain.
Late 20s and Swedish.
Check the kitchen area.
- Hey, you got a match?
- l don't smoke.
Hello! Have we solved
the mystery yet?
Should have given you some applause.
(Man) Wait a minute. Where's
she going? l think she likes me.
Conductor, the passkey!
Quick! Give me the passkey.
- Do you mind?!
- l beg your pardon.
First, some sweaty pervert
and now...
What sweaty pervert?
Jennifer! The baggage car.
lt's the only possible place.
Conductor, follow me.
We need your help.
(Kaplan speaks Swedish)
You speak Swedish?
(Swedish)
Great. Come on. Follow me.
(Herman) Take care of the suitcase.
Look...l want you to find out
where he's been,
and who he's contacted. Find out
anything. Understand? Anything.
- Let's go.
- You're sure it isn't measles, huh?
Just find out anything.
You'll be all right.
(Swedish)
- ''We've got him. He's conscious.''
- Fine. Now, hear this.
Get him into the helicopter above.
- Stop the train.
- No, keep it moving.
You want a thousand passengers
getting off and walking about?
Get me the helicopter pilot.
''On the move? Can't you slow it?
''We'll try, sir.''
- Have you found out anything?
- Might as well talk to the dog.
What is it? ls it catching?
lf you haven't caught it,
you never will.
- Quickly. Come on.
- We're coming.
Quickly. We've got to hurry.
Come on!
- Tie his feet.
- Here, hold him.
There's a tunnel in about 12 miles.
Then there's no chance.
They'll be in the mountains.
Goddammit! Jennifer!
(Doctor) Come and hold me.
We'll both fall out.
You hold me.
Now! Good girl!
Good girl. OK.
Conductor, get the dog.
''Jesus Christ, the trees! Reel in!''
l lost it!
(Doctor) OK, get him up!
(Guard) l'm trying to.
My God, the tunnel!
Hurry, for God's sake!
Lift him!
Reel in!
Oh!
Jonathan!
He's in a coma.
''Mackenzie, he's gone into coma.
l need some answers.
''Mortality rates, antiserum?''
- Dr Stradner.
- There is no antiserum.
lt spreads by aerogenic droplets.
''lt has an infection rate of 60%.
''The first symptoms are those
of a common cold.''
That's it? That's all you know?
l don't have to tell you
what we're up against.
What YOU'RE up against?
l may be the only doctor
for a thousand plague victims.
lt's important
to contain the disease now.
- You're heading for an isolation...
- ''What shall l fight it with?''
Aspirin?
Now, l want medical supplies.
Doctors, nurses, drugs.
You'll get them. The train
will be sealed at Nuremberg.
''Your medical team will be there.''
After you've sealed it? What then?
Drop us in the ocean?
''Hope it doesn't leak?''
Let's not panic.
l'm sure you can handle it.
- Don't patronise me.
- l'm not, Chamberlain. l'm not.
l'm going to give the passengers
a cover story to avoid panic.
Give them what you like,
but make sure l get
the supplies l need.
Chamberlain sounds a bit panicky.
- Could be trouble.
- He's all we've got.
lf the disease is worrying you,
you couldn't make a finer choice.
- What's your name, Conductor?
- Max, Doctor.
Max, we think that man's only
contacts were made in first class.
Stand in the dining car and make
sure nobody goes through either way.
- Perhaps we can contain it.
- l'll do that.
(Sneezing)
Sure. Here, sweets.
Thank you.
lf your name is Haley,
why is there a J here?
Why, for Baby Jesus, sweets.
l thought surely you'd know that.
She's such a sweet girl.
Yeah.
Sir. What'll we do
with the dog, sir?
Bring it back.
Bring it back.
- All right, Major.
- Thank you.
(Major) Bring it in.
You can wash for a week. lt will
not make the slightest difference.
- What would you prescribe?
- Stop breathing.
That's how it's transmitted.
Christ! Are we all going to die?
60%, she said.
A thousand people on the train.
So 600.
How do you get into the 400?
Natural immunity, fate, God.
l don't know. THEY don't know.
- Scared?
- Absolutely terrified.
''Ladies and gentlemen...
''Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the railway authority in Geneva.
''We have a problem which will alter
the train's schedule.
''The French railways have just
notified us of a bomb threat.
''Terrorists claim to have placed
several bombs on railway lines,
''railroad bridges and stations
throughout France.
''The claims are being investigated.
''For greater safety, we've decided
to re-route your train.
''The regular stops at Basel
and Paris will now not be made.
''We're sorry for the inconvenience.
We hope you understand our caution.''
There is of course no danger
of anything happening
to the train itself.
We'll keep you informed
as soon as we have further news.
Mummy and Daddy will be very cross.
lmagine - the wife of one of the
world's greatest arms manufacturers
being blown to bits by a bomb.
Hugo would be furious. He'll swear
it was done just to irritate him.
Don't look so cross, baby.
You're my brave mountain climber.
You don't mind if l have a little
fun with you in public?
lf they blow us up,
you'll die with a clear conscience.
This always happens in Europe!
l'm going to sue the bloody company.
l ain't coming back to Europe.
(All talk at once)
Hey!
Keep calm. Nothing will happen.
- Would you like a sandwich?
- No, thank you!
- Do you know who l am?
- l don't care who you are.
Please let me off the train.
Hey, you speak English, don't you?
l've gotta get off in Paris.
- What can l do?
- Think of something.
That's impossible.
You can't force anyone to stay on!
- Go back to your...
- Go to hell!
Better one day late in Paris
than 20 years early in heaven.
Since we're not stopping in Paris,
l have a beautiful Cartier watch...
Naturally.
Of course.
Get me the MP Headquarters
at Nuremberg.
Let's see if we CAN seal
the goddamn thing.
- You know what?
- Mm-hm?
l don't fly. l haven't smoked
a cigarette for over a year.
l am watching my diet.
- Point is, for what?
- l don't know.
l'm sorry, Jonathan. Truly l am.
- Sorry? For what?
- About the book.
lf anything happens to us,
it will be your epitaph,
and it's not quite true.
And not quite false either.
Like our relationship.
Not quite. Could have been.
Should have been.
Hey!
- How about a smoke, yeah?
- Oh, God, l'd love it.
Oh, God, l've missed it!
- And flying?
- That too.
And?
- And?
- And?
That too.
- You've got a new ring.
- lt's fake.
But this is still real.
(Stradner)
This sample is from the dog.
lt's reproducing more rapidly.
lt has mutated.
- Meaning?
- l don't know...yet.
Amazing! You've been winning
for over an hour now.
- l've been cheating.
- l know, but how do you do it?
Skill. Where are we going, Max?
- Poland.
- Poland?
l can't go back to Poland.
l know. lt's going to be difficult
on this train for everybody.
A lot of people
are going to get very sick.
You and l are old friends. l'll be
looking for you to help me out.
This is no good. You need help.
Watch, watch, watch.
Watch, watch, watch.
Watch.
You look tired. Here, let me.
(Baby cries )
(Sings a lullaby)
Now, here's where
we're going, OK?
lt was the conductor
with our planned route.
Some people have got
chills and fever.
Here we go?
Here we go.
The dog is approaching coma.
Everything set at Nuremberg?
Just ironing out the final details.
When you do, get me Captain Scott.
l want to talk to him...privately.
Yes, sir.
l want one.
(Baby cries )
- Hey, how you doing?
- l'm fine.
- You are?
- Mm-hm.
She's much better at this than l am.
More patient.
(Baby screams )
Hey.
Doctor, you have a patient.
(Guard) This is now a hospital car.
Everybody else, please leave.
- What's happening?
- A few people are a little ill.
Nothing serious, but we need
the car. Please leave. Thank you.
(Baby cries )
Yes. Sshh.
Excuse me.
- l need a doctor.
- Why? l think she's real sick.
Mr Kaplan, hold the baby
for a second.
- Feel chilly?
- Yes.
Just follow me. Follow me
down to the other compartment.
- What is it?
- She'll be all right.
(Whispers ) Keep an eye on her.
Yes. Yes. Sshh. Sshh.
Don't look too good, huh?
Ah, Liebchen, even now,
you make me wish l was 50 again.
- Please, l must feed my baby.
- Yes.
- Get some food for the baby.
- OK, right away.
Any passengers attempting
to escape must be stopped.
Shot and killed if necessary.
l repeat, shot and killed.
- ''Read me, Captain Scott?''
- l read you.
(Boy) Mamma.
(Woman) lt's OK.
- Doctor!
- One moment.
You're not...?
- You?
- No.
Doctor, she's very sick.
Will you come with me, please?
lt'll be all right.
What is it? What's it all about?
lt's a slight case
of food poisoning, l think.
Either you're a lousy doctor
or a lousy liar.

over loudspeaker)
- Look, Cheryl.
- Where?
Look at those men in white.
Look, Mom.
Tell the con...
Tell the conductor
that he must lock this door.
''Attention!
Attention, s'il vous plaît.''
(Announcement in French
over loudspeaker)
Halt!
Halt! Halt!
Get back on the train.
We don't wanna kill anybody.
Oh! Oh, baby. Come on.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
Don't be an idiot.
Even lago's getting medical
attention. See the doctor.
Why?
(Baby cries )
(Screams hysterically)
No! No! No!
Take it easy. She's hysterical.
What are you doing?
Do you mind?
These are expensive cigars.
You can't do that.
Please, please.
Please. That's everything l have.
Please. l'll do everything you want.
That's my whole life.
(Doctor) Leave him alone.
(Announcement begins in ltalian)
That was very silly of you,
wasn't it, Mr Kaplan?
l think the bullet passed through.
Well, gunshot wounds l can handle.
Follow me. Come on.
Mr Kaplan, you'll get them back.
Let's take care of the arm first.
- You don't have to aim it at me.
- What are you doing?
(Man) One way to stop smoking(!)
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est, ça?
Cassandra Crossing.
We're headed
for an isolation camp there.
ls that what they call it now?
But that bridge
couldn't exist there now.
l can't go.
- lt's not my first choice either.
- lch kann nicht gehen.
Mr Kaplan.
- No, kann nicht...
- Mr Kaplan.
No. lch kann nicht zuruckgehen.
Mr Kaplan.
- Hold him there, will you?
- Yeah. OK.
lch kann nicht zuruckgehen.
No, please.
No!
No, please! No!
l'm sorry. l really am.
l can't go back.
Jennifer. Roll up his sleeve.
l can't go back.
lch kann nicht zuruckgehen.
Meine Frau, meine Kinder.
Cassandra...Crossing.
Cassandra Crossing.
Can't go back.
Kann nicht...
Can't.
Can't...go back.
Please.
Notice this point in the graph.
The dog seems to be holding its own.
Sir.
Polish Government wants us to review
the stress tolerance at that bridge.
We haven't heard back
from Chamberlain yet, have we?
No, sir.
- Captain Scott?
- Not yet.
l'll handle this, Doctor.
Cassandra Crossing.
- That look.
- What?
That look on poor Mr Kaplan's face.
l was quite surprised the way
you handled him.
l never thought of you
as an old-fashioned nurse.
l never thought of you as
a country doctor. Someone who cares.
That's what doctors are for,
darling.
Not the one l knew, darling.
Where are you going?
How far can l go? l'll be back.
- Don't take too long.
- No, l won't.
Where are we, Conductor? Poland?
Not yet, Miss Rispoli, but when
we get there, l'll let you know.
You've been over this...
Cassandra Crossing?
Yes, but not since 1948 when they
closed that part of the line down.
- l'm surprised it's still there.
- What do you mean?
The name comes from
the Trojan princess Cassandra
whose predictions nobody believed.
Local people thought the bridge
would collapse, so they moved out.
l see l've upset you,
but there's nothing to worry about.
After all this, it isn't logical
to assume we'll end up down a gorge.
l know that, sir, but...
Sir, if you'll allow me to read
these stress figures,
you'll see
there's cause for genuine concern.
Naturally.
l understand. Yes, sir.
Of course.
(Mme Dressler) Doctor! Doctor!
- Don't be a fool. He won't admit...
- Leave me alone.
Please, everyone!
Such a stubborn baby.
Just like on that mountain.
Admit something's wrong.
- He's a mountain climber?
- Yes.
Yes, that's how l met him.
l was at the ski lodge at Cortina.
He and a couple of other characters
decided they would climb this sheer
mountain face about 10,000 feet up.
- He obviously made it.
- And me.
(Doctor) Roll up your sleeve.
Roll up your sleeve, please.
l think we'll hold off
the medication for a while.
Will he be all right, Doctor?
Well, he climbed a mountain,
didn't he?
Let me know if he gets worse.
There. You see,
that wasn't so...bad.
(Man) ls there any water?
This, er...Cassandra Crossing.
You've been over it.
lt's as bad as they say?
People once lived underneath,
but they moved away.
By the end of the war,
only sheep walked under it.
lt's all the same now.
Don't you see? Whatever
happens here is God's will.
He wants me to go back to Janov,
to the camp where my wife,
my babies...
..Rachel, Elaia, died.
He must.
And l must stop fighting Him.
l understand, Mr Kaplan.
l sympa...sympathise.
- Colonel Mackenzie?
- ''Go ahead, Doctor.''
- We're holding steady at 61 cases.
- ''Any fatalities?''
Two. One elderly, but both died
from secondary causes.
There are no reported cases
in second class.
''l suggest we uncouple that section
''and isolate them
from the infected area.''
- ''l'm afraid that l can't do that.''
- Why not?
''We can set up a quarantine
for that section.''
l am not stopping that train.
lt goes to Janov.
(Stradner) Colonel!
Now, you listen to me...
- Stay out of this, Dr Stradner.
- Colonel, the dog is recovering.
(Guard speaks Polish)
Just ask him!
l can't believe that 1 ,000 people
will be sent to their death
by the lnternational
Health Organisation.
- lt defeats the purpose!
- Ask him.
On a hunch?
My last one
didn't turn out too badly.
''Dr Chamberlain...''
''Sorry we got cut off. You'll be
arriving in Janov in four hours.''
''lf you think of anything else
you might need...''
- Yes, there's one thing.
- ''Yes?''
The Cassandra Crossing -
it's unsafe.
- What do you mean by that?
- ''l mean it's unsafe.
''lt's a disused line
that was closed down in 1948.''
Now, Doctor, the railroad
authorities assure us that...
Local people won't live under it
any more.
''You've been there?''
The conductor and a passenger have.
Would you care to talk to them?
Now, you listen to me.
We've had that bridge tested
by computer and personal inspection.
The Polish Government
has spent more money
in the last two years
rebuilding that bridge
than it cost to build it
in the first place!
''There's no more risk
than flying an airline.''
That's the point.
l don't fly.
Colonel Mackenzie is a liar.
Oh. Thanks for the thought, Father,
but he's an atheist.
So am l.
This is insane.
We've been tracking your Mr Navarro
for quite some time.
- He's sick. He may die.
- Yeah, and he may not.
Since l'm immune to this disease,
he'll have to remain my prisoner.
- What's he done?
- Trafficking in contraband.
- Narcotics.
- Oh, God, what have you done?
Shut up and do exactly as l say
and everything'll be OK.
Robby...
lf you shoot me,
there's a guard in each car.
They'll cut you to pieces.
Have to go through you first.
Tell him l'm very sick
and l've got to see the doctor.
- This man must see the doctor.
- No.
Tell him Madame Hugo Dressler
would like to see him.
Don't move.
Now open the door very slowly.
Nobody move!
- All right. Who's in charge here?
- l am.
Tell them to drop their guns.
Tell them or l'll blow her head off.
OK, drop 'em!
(Robby) You too.
l applaud your decision,
but l doubt he has the guts for it.
Keep your mouth shut.
OK, kick that one over here.
You, move over there.
All right.
l want this train stopped, now!
My orders come
from Colonel Mackenzie.
l don't give a damn about your
orders. l'm giving the orders now.
l want a helicopter brought here
immediately. She's going with me.
Any funny stuff and she's dead.
(Guard) l'm not authorised
to stop this train.
Now you're authorised.
(Guard) There are 43 armed guards
on this train.
OK.
Then l'll start with you.
(Robby) l'll go through you all till
l find one who can stop the train.
Go ahead, Robby.
- Huh?
- Go ahead.
(Doctor) Well, Robby...do it.
Start with him, then him, then him.
Don't forget him.
And then you've got 40 more.
Go on.
Come on, l know you can do it well.
What do you need, Robby?
What do you need?
Another shot of heroin?
Heroin. How common, darling!
Common? And without courage.
You gonna shoot me? Go on.
Go on, Rob.
DO lT!
GO ON AND DO lT!
l know you can do it. Do it!
DO lT! GO ON AND DO lT!
DO lT! DO lT!
You know that my Hugo makes these?
He'll be delighted
you're using them.
- Confine this man up front.
- He's going with me.
l mean, where can he go to?
- OK, take him.
- Come on, baby.
(Young man) Guess what, Doc?
She's hungry.
There's no doubt about it. The dog's
vital signs are steadily improving.
Call Dr Chamberlain. Tell him.
That information might be useful.
Tell him what? That a basset hound
seems to be temporarily recovering?
l'm not raising any false hopes,
or worse, giving your colleague any
ideas about stopping before Janov.
Why does stopping the train
bother you so much?
(Baby gurgles )
Thank you. lt's a miracle.
Well, we could do with a few more.
Here we go. Yes!
- How are you feeling?
- l feel fine. Much better.
- Throat still sore?
- Mmm, a bit. lt's OK, thank you.
Here we are.
Now, tell me, how are you?
- l'm well, thank you.
- You are?
Now let's see this, now.
Just my rotten luck.
l could've used a priest.
For what, a deathbed confession?
No. My wedding.
l believe this belongs to you.
My friend has no further use for it.
lt's no go.
The radio's still out their end.
(Colonel) What about Scott?
(Stradner) The oxygen.
The oxygen!
lt's the only possible answer.
The bacteria are killed
by the enriched oxygen.
They reproduce
at an increasing rate.
Their virulence subsides
at a corresponding rate.
They literally burn themselves out.
The dog was in oxygen.
The train is highly oxygenated.
That's why only two people
have died so far.
But the man in the hospital,
he was given oxygen.
But he absorbed the disease
directly into the bloodstream
through a wound.
The people on the train
will also recover.
You must tell Dr Chamberlain.
Dr Chamberlain, Dr Chamberlain,
this is Dr Stradner.
Come in, Dr Chamberlain. Hello!
Captain Scott, if you'd heard
Mackenzie, you'd know
there was some concern
about that bridge.
Doctor, you're tired. Go get
some rest. How about that radio?
Goddammit! People are recovering!
There's every possibility
we don't have to cross that bridge!
Stop the train for an hour.
Let me do an examination.
- l have no authority.
- You're not Mackenzie's robot!
A thousand lives are at stake here,
including you and your men.
Now pick up that phone and tell
the driver to stop this train.
l'm ordering you out
of this compartment.
(Argument continues )
Looks like you're not doing well.
lt's not up to him, right?
From now on...
..it's up to us.
There must be a way
to stop that train.
lt'll stop...when it reaches Janov.
Guess what?
l've finished.
Would you like a drink?
(Knock on door)
Yes.
We're having a meeting. l thought
perhaps you might like to join us.
What sort of meeting?
Some sort of group therapy?
We're taking over the train
before it's too late.
l don't want you to go, Robby.
No, Robby, you don't have to go.
Not for me.
lt's not for you, babe.
You still don't get it, do you?
Travelling back and forth
across Europe,
passing through customs without
question because l was with you,
and all the rest of it, babe.
Nothing was ever for you. Nothing.
- Officer?
- lnspector.
l need your help
for a slight diversion.
- Of course.
- That gun will come in handy.
(Stradner) Do something!
Send a plane to warn them,
put flares on the track, anything!
No good getting hysterical. There's
a good chance they'll make it.
What makes you an expert when even
the goddamn computer isn't sure?
For the love of God, woman,
do you think l'd purposely murder
a thousand people?
No.
No...but l think you'd simply
let them be killed.
And that's almost worse.
- How can l help you, lnspector?
- Stop this train.
(lnspector)
You have no legal authority here.
There's only one law enforcement
officer on this train and that's me
and l order you to stop this train.
Don't.
Go back inside. Go back inside!
How do you use this?
Each clip has 20 rounds.
This is your automatic...
You promised there'd be
a minimum of violence.
Got to have something
to fight back with.
l'd better check on Tom.
Jennifer, go with him. Keep down.
Take Nicole with you.
lt'll be safer back there.
Mr Kaplan, we'll be in the next car.
You'll find me in the dining car.
You won't be able to make
it through to the engineer.
l don't want to.
l've got a mountain climber.
Maybe what we're doing
is God's will.
(Doctor)
Get everybody into second class!
Come on. Everybody out.
Leave the bags. Get going.
Sir, we're evacuating this car.
- That's it. OK?
- OK.
Gimme a boost.
Aaagh!
(Doctor) Get the gun!
(Girl) Get down!
- How's he doing?
- Must be halfway now.
- What are you doing here?
- l can't make it.
- What?
- They're on the top.
- What?
- Have a look for yourself.
Katerina. Katerina.
Katerina.
Where are you?
Let's get out of here. Go on.
Haley, come up here.
Tom, cover that end.
Haley, you cover there.
Why don't you surrender?
lt's hopeless.
- We can stop them eating.
- Stop.
There may be another way.
ls it possible to disconnect this
part of the train from the rest?
Each car has its own control box,
but the electronic coupling
is serviced
from underneath, right there.
- How do we cut through here?
- For what?
l'm gonna try and disconnect this
part of the train from the rest.
- What about the other people?
- l'm thinking about THESE people.
They'll all die. The children!
The girl, what's her name? Katerina!
- Stop it!
- But how can l?
The train will be lighter.
They may cross the bridge.
Do you understand?
That. How does it work?
- Gas. Propane.
- Gas from where?
Propane here.
l'll be back.
- No!
- l'll be right back. Sit down!
The valve. Remember that valve.
The slightest spark,
the whole thing will blow.
Just so it doesn't blow
the train off the tracks.
Get me paper, boxes,
twine for a fuse
and anything that lights.
l might be able to reach the engine
and stop the train
by crawling along the side
of the cars on these shutters.
- That's impossible.
- Maybe not.
l've tracked him for two months.
He'll jump off and let us all die.
- At this speed?
- What's his choice?
The lives of hundreds of people.
- Can you make it?
- l'll try.
Navarro,
if l see you touch the ground, l'm
gonna close your case. Understand?
Understand.
Max, l need a pair of tennis shoes.
Tom, let me have those shoes.
Hey!
There you go. Come on.
lf l didn't think it was a cinch,
l wouldn't waste my time. Ciao.
Katerina.
- The dog has completely recovered.
- Fine.
Why don't you go take him
for a walk?
Dr Chamberlain,
there are four men dead already.
You cannot stop this train.
- Are you ready?
- OK.
OK, go!
Mr Kaplan.
OK, go!
Go back!
GO!
Good luck.
No! No! No!
AAAGH!
Nanny! Nanny!
- Jennifer.
- Yes.
Navarro didn't make it.
So quick, hurry on.
- Here. Here.
- Good girl.
Turn on the gas valve and make sure
everybody's gone to second class.
- You don't intend to stay?
- Go on!
- Let's get out of here!
- Wait, wait!
- Katerina is up there.
- So is my husband.
Now!
Tom!
Be careful.
(Gas hisses )
Dr Chamberlain!
Come out, Doctor.
For God's sake, come out.
You leave me no choice.
(Doctor)
Haley, l need a match for the fuse!
(Doctor) l need a match!
Mr Kaplan.
Mr Kaplan. Mr Kaplan, go back
to the second class. Go quickly.
Nanny!
- Nanny!
- Sweets!
- Nanny!
- Run, sweets, run!
Run to me, sweets.
(She screams )
(Gas hisses )
- Jonathan!
- Nanny!
Nanny!
Jonathan!
(Katerina) Nanny.
Jonathan!
Jonathan!
- Major Stack.
- Yes, sir.
See this goes out right away.
Congratulations.
They're finally in quarantine.
There may be survivors.
The disease could still spread.
Maybe.
Not if your theory
about the oxygen is correct.
That oxygen would have caused
an explosion in all the cars.
l see.
Well, as you said,
you had every option wired.
Goodbye, Colonel.
Dr Stradner...
l know you see me
as some sort of monster...
You're only an obedient
link in a chain of command.
l realise it's no longer
fashionable to be a military man,
but it's my job and l do it well.
l'll grant you that.
My job was to contain this disease.
Not just the bacteria,
but the very idea of it.
lf you undo what l've done,
then they'll have sacrificed
their lives for nothing.
l understand, Colonel...
completely.
Remember you're a doctor
and a damn good one.
Stay a doctor, please,
for your own sake.
Stop pushing.
lt's all right.
lt's all right, baby.
Come on.
Come on. Quickly.
- Max, have you seen Jennifer?
- No.
Come quickly. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Mackenzie here.
Sir, there's been an accident,
a tragic accident.
No survivors. On that
you have my personal assurance.
What?
Thank YOU, sir.
By the way, Colonel,
how well do you know Geneva?
There's a terrific little place
around the corner. Quiet. Private.
How about l buy you a drink?
(Phone buzzes )
Stack, sir.
He just left. The woman too.
No, sir. They're both
under surveillance.
