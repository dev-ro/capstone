Mom.
Mom.
Are you out here?
Carly.
Help me.
Carly.
Mom.
Carly.
Mom, are you in here?
Help me.
Mom.
Carly.
I'm here.
Just a little further.
I'm here.
Mom.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- What are you doing?
Don't you see what you're
standing in?
What the hell, Martin?
- Girl.
- Wine o'clock?
Damn right.
I wanna see the place.
I'm, uh, I'm on my way.
Just send me the address.
- Okay, see you soon.
- Bye.
What?
All right.
I have to admit, I was
beginning to wonder
what the hell I was doing
back here,
but this is what makes it
worth it.
Hi.
- Too long.
- Look at you.
Let me take a look at you.
You look like shit.
What's going on?
Good to see you, too, big city.
Check out my workspace.
It's up here.
Hang on. Are you working
here or house sitting?
- A little of both.
- Okay.
I mean, if the designs I submit
get accepted,
then can turn into a long term thing.
Not the house,
obviously.
I'm so happy
you're back, pal.
Am I really having
another? I am, aren't I?
- I am having another piece. Yeah.
- It's so good.
So what else is going?
I mean, catch me up.
What have I missed?
I got a text from Martin.
- Martin?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah, just, uh, just before I came over.
- Wow.
- I mean, I haven't spoken to him since,
God, it must be like six
or seven years now.
I don't know.
Yeah.
- Did you text him back?
- No.
I can't go near any of that
anymore.
You know?
Good. No one needs to hear
his insane theories
after everything that happened
with your mother.
I don't know that I was that
good at listening to you
after all the shit
you went through.
You were just fine, okay?
But this is way too heavy
for one glass of wine.
Easily fixed.
No, no, no.
I'm, uh, I'm driving.
And I actually should get going.
- You're kidding?
- I know.
- You just got here.
- I know.
I've got you back now.
We can do this like
so many times over.
Okay.
Thank you.
I will see you later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't know what to get you, but I remembered
you always loved Coke so I got you a Coke.
Thanks.
How are you doing?
How are you... how are you
holding up and stuff?
I'm all right.
I got a job assembling truck bodies.
Keeps me busy.
Welding.
Are you still at the same house
on the bench?
Yeah.
It's nice there.
So what's the deal?
So a few days ago I got a call from
this medical tech company on the valley.
Uh, they offered me some money
to be part of like a focus group.
So I went and when I got there,
there were all these real
actual hospital patients.
What?
That's fucked up.
Yeah, but the patient was
your mom, Carly.
I mean, it was Angela.
And they knew that I knew her
somehow.
I mean, I didn't find that out
until I got there.
Wait. What? She's in a clinic?
Is she sick?
Carly, she's in a coma.
I mean, she's fully paralyzed.
- A coma, what happened?
- I don't know. They didn't say.
It looked like correctional
services brought her up there.
I mean, she's still like
a felon or whatever, right,
but she's being allowed
to be a patient
in this medical research thing.
Did you actually see her?
Yeah. The second I recognized
her, I left, but yeah.
Ugh.
They wanted your contact information,
but I didn't give it to them.
I don't think that they know
that you changed your last name
but they're gonna find you.
I'm sorry things got so weird
between us.
And I understand why you got
so angry, I do.
- Like, I get it.
- It's fine.
You don't have to apologize.
It was just,
it was hard for me then.
Didn't wanna hear all that
stuff, okay?
We're cool.
- Hello.
- Is this a Miss Spencer?
- Yeah, that's me.
- Hi, my name is Michael Dolos from Therapol.
- I know who you are.
- Okay.
My friend Martin told me you
called.
Yes, your mother, Angela,
she's our patient.
I'm just wondering if you would
perhaps be open
to coming in to visit with her.
She's not doing too well
unfortunately.
Miss Spencer?
Uh, yeah, I'm here.
What happened to her?
I don't understand.
Why is she in a clinic?
I'm sorry, but we can't discuss
medical details
of patients over the phone,
but if you come in,
we can explain everything
to you.
It's a very unusual
circumstance for us.
Yeah, I'll do it.
Okay, great. Um...
Could you come in tomorrow?
- Yeah, yes.
- Great, I'll text you the address.
Thank you so much,
Miss Spencer.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Miss Spencer.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I'm Michael. We spoke last night
on the phone.
Thank you, uh, so much
for coming in today.
I do appreciate it.
Let me take you inside.
Uh, what...
what is this place?
Therapol is a new company.
Medical imaging industry.
Some of our funding is
governmental.
Some of it's private.
We develop cutting-edge
technology here
to try and alleviate suffering
in patients.
At least that's our goal.
A lot of the technology
is so new,
it doesn't really even exist.
Someone is building it.
Right this way.
After you.
Please, uh, just have a seat.
This is Daniel.
He's our lead researcher here.
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Daniel is a PhD in two fields,
biomedical imaging
and neurology.
Okay, and, uh, and you?
I'm a physician primarily.
Anyway, thank you for coming in.
We know it's not an ideal
situation.
Our lab has a relationship
with hospitals
and prisons all over the country
for possible candidates
for our research.
Very specific requirements.
Yeah, uh...
I've been out of touch with her
for a very long time.
I don't know much about what's
happened to her over the years,
but Martin, who you met,
said she's in a coma.
Is that... is that accurate?
Yes, sadly.
Her syndrome is very rare.
It's called LIS or locked-in
syndrome.
Typically the patient is
completely aware,
but they are unable to move at
all due to complete paralysis
of all voluntary muscles
in the body.
Why?
I mean, what happened?
Well, in your mother's case, it appears to be
the result of a brain injury, head trauma.
She had an episode in prison
apparently.
Her case of pseudocoma
is very unusual.
She's unable to breathe
on her own.
She can't even move her eyes.
So it's a total locked-in state.
But her mind is very active.
She just won't communicate
with us in the simulation,
except to ask for you.
Uh, simulation?
Yes. That's why we asked you
to come in.
Think of what we're
building here
as kind of a second reality
for all your senses.
Your thoughts, like where to
move your hand,
are driven by your motor cortex.
We redirect these impulses
to a digital version of you
and in that virtual space,
you will meet your mother.
But you have to think of it as
stepping into someone's mind.
Into her mind.
It can be very confusing
for the outsider
because a piece of one place,
one memory,
might be inserted into another,
kind of like a dream.
- Make sense?
- Um...
We should let you know, too,
we are aware of your mother's convictions.
We can certainly appreciate
how complicated
the relationship might be
for you.
To know that our research
is making a difference,
we need to know how she's doing
on the inside,
if it's making life better
for her.
So, you want me to communicate
with her?
Get her to open up
as much as possible.
See how she's doing.
We wanna know if there's
anything we can do
to make her life more
comfortable.
All right, let's get started.
Okay, this capture will represent
how you look in the simulation.
So just stand there with your
arms out, please,
like in a "T" pose.
- Yeah, okay.
- Great.
Okay.
Three, two, one.
Okay.
Carly, uh, wait.
Before you go in, remember your
mother's in a bad state.
I don't want you to be shocked.
It can be a real shock
for a family member
who hasn't seen something
like this before.
Oh, my God.
Prison guards reported her
becoming more
and more violent over the years.
Self harming.
Episodes of psychotic
hallucinations.
Until eventually she sustained
the brain injury.
Carly, you'll be lying
over here.
Take your shoes off,
please,
and you can leave your things
down here.
Okay. You can turn to me.
Now this will read and transmit
directly
to your brain in the sim, okay?
Is that too tight?
- Okay, just lie back.
- No, that's good. Okay.
We'll be monitoring everything from a
control room. Make sure you're okay.
Uh, wait. When I'm inside,
can I communicate with you?
Yes, we can hear and see
you, but you cannot hear us
or if you ask, we'll pull you
right out immediately, okay?
Okay.
Okay, Carly.
Just take a deep breath in.
And we're about to drop you
into the simulation, okay?
Okay, close your eyes.
And three, two, one.
Okay, looking good.
And she's dropping in.
Oh, my God.
How is this possible?
Angela.
It's me. It's...
It's Carly, your...
It's Carly.
I debated whether I should
come here at all.
I didn't wanna see you.
Actually, I didn't wanna
see you ever again.
I decided that long ago.
But then I realized something.
I never got a chance to tell you
how much I hate you.
So that's why I'm here.
I came here to tell you how
fucking disgusting you are.
And now I know you can die
having heard exactly how I feel.
Carly, I knew that.
And now I need you to leave.
You have to go.
What?
You want me to leave you?
Turn and look at me, Angela.
I don't want to look
at you.
I don't want to endanger you.
Look at me.
Turn and look at me.
You're so beautiful,
but now you have to go.
Go, sweetheart, please.
You can hate me.
Go, go, go.
Yeah, okay, yeah, well,
that's just perfect.
It's just perfect.
That's better than I could've imagined.
You ask me to leave?
You've really outdone yourself,
Angela.
You go.
Go and don't you come back.
Don't ever come back.
You hear me?
- Go.
- You know what?
- Fuck you.
- Get her out.
She could be beyond her
threshold.
Yeah.
- How did she seem to you?
- Sorry, sorry, guys.
I just need a second.
The whole thing's just a bit
of a shock.
She seemed, um...
I don't know.
Same as she's always been
I suppose. Uh...
I don't know, disconnected.
Crazy.
Where did she place you?
Um, where was the simulation?
It was, uh,
my childhood home.
Some stuff was wrong.
Off slightly.
Yeah, that's how she
remembers it.
Did she seem like
she was in any pain at all?
We didn't hear her mention
anything relating to her condition.
Feeling trapped, claustrophobic,
out of body experiences.
No, I don't think so.
She was younger, though.
Like around the same time as
when she went to prison.
The age regression is a coping
mechanism for Angela.
It seemed like a very informative
first meeting, though.
- Hmm.
- Wait, first?
Well, we would like you
to do another.
- No. No.
- Carly, um...
You're a smart woman and I'm
not gonna try and bullshit you.
The only reason you came here
today
was to simply tell her
how you feel.
Am I correct?
Anger, right?
What's under that anger?
You're hurt.
Understandably, you're confused.
Your mother went on a homicidal
rampage.
She left you
almost two decades ago.
Why?
Ask her these questions.
This is your chance.
Shit.
Carly.
Mom.
I can't.
Fuck, okay.
Carly!
Carly, Carly, Carly, Carly.
Thank you for coming in again.
I know it must be really
difficult.
Thanks.
Okay, just lay back.
- How is she?
- Okay. For now, I think.
Okay, Carly.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- All right, dropping you in in three,
two, one.
Angela.
It's me again.
It's Carly.
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?
Can you guys see that?
What is it?
No, no, no.
Let her decide.
Angela?
Angela.
Why are you here?
Because this is where
it gets its power.
But now it lives in me.
What lives in you?
Carly, you have to go.
Please go.
I'm begging you.
Go, Carly, go.
Angela, I came back a second
time to ask you something.
Why would you call me here?
Why would you call Martin here?
Why us after all these years?
I didn't.
It did.
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.
Now go.
Get out.
Please go.
You have to go.
You have to go.
- You have to go.
- Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop doing that.
You guys. Daniel, please!
Please, please let me out.
Michael, Daniel,
can you hear me?
- Guys, let me out!
- Come on, what are we doing?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Just... just wait.
Go, go, go, go, go.
You have to go.
Go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go.
Where the fuck is the exit?
Okay, how do I get out?
What do I do? Okay.
Carly, think.
Carly, think.
Carly.
What?
It can't be.
Sam.
Sam.
What?
How is this possible?
Sam.
No! Okay.
Make a left here.
Okay.
Here we go.
Just follow me down the hall.
What the fuck happened to me?
We don't have answers.
Did someone cut me while I was under?
Did you do this to me?
- No.
- Well, then why the fuck didn't you pull me out?
I asked to be pulled out.
You said you could hear me.
- Is that a lie?
- Miss Spencer...
Obviously we can appreciate
how upset you are.
You have every right.
We just need to ask you a few questions.
She said she did not ask for us.
She didn't ask for me or Martin.
She did.
I can promise you that.
I'm gonna try
to be brief, okay?
Now, your mother took you to a
memory of a building. What was that?
I mean, in the real world,
where does this memory come from?
You said you know what Angela
was convicted of?
Yes, on paper, yes, but any information
you can give us can be helpful.
Her life revolved around
nursing.
She loved her job.
I had a close-knit small group.
Sam, my best friend,
Martin, and me.
Just the three of us
neighborhood kids.
Anyway, this one afternoon
we were drinking at my house
because Angela was out...
and I suddenly had
this feeling.
Like, I can't even explain.
It was like the worst feeling
in my life.
What feeling?
That something had happened
to her.
She told me she was going
an hour north that morning
to this place, a sanatorium for
tuberculosis.
She was on the prevential
medical team
asked to evaluate if it could
eventually be reopened.
I forced Martin to drive us
there.
When we got there,
we found her car abandoned,
but we couldn't find her.
Mom?
We couldn't find her anywhere.
Mom?!
And we went into that
disgusting building.
Mom?
Mom! Hey!
I see a cut.
Grab your shirt.
Her arm was cut, bleeding.
Like this.
Exactly like this.
I remember getting her home.
She wouldn't talk to me.
It went on like that
for a few weeks.
Weeks?
Yeah, she was, uh,
she was gone.
Comatose.
It... It got worse
and worse, though.
Mom, I'm gonna go over
to Sam's first.
Then I come home this one day
and she's being loaded
into a squad car.
And I remember her looking
at me.
She smiled at me.
Then I found out she'd... set fire...
...to an old aged care home.
A place she'd worked before.
She killed 21 people.
I'm so sorry, Carly.
They also uncovered that she
poisoned people
at a local church.
- Killed another five...
- including my grandmother.
The whole town turned on me
by extension.
So I made a choice that day
that I would never see her
again.
That I would never
speak to her.
Fuck, look, I can't do this
anymore, okay?
Can we just be done, please?
Just one thing,
please. Um...
Was there anyone else there
with you
in the simulation with you
and your mother?
Sam, yeah.
My friend Sam was in there.
- Can I go, please?
- Yeah, of course, that's okay.
That's more than enough.
The building,
the sanatorium, where was that?
Does it matter?
Hey, what's up, babe?
Thank God.
What?
Sorry, I just, um...
Uh, I had strange feeling
about you.
- I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
- Oh.
That's a pretty fucking weird
and creepy thing to say.
Yeah,
I guess you're right. It is.
- Sorry.
- You okay? You sound terrible.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I just had a really fucking weird morning.
Hey.
Uh, sorry for just showing up.
But I... I need to talk to you.
Can I come in?
Okay.
I went to see Angela
today at that clinic.
You did?
In the simulation,
she took me to
that building
where we found her.
What do you mean she took you
to that building?
It's like being in
a person's memory.
I found her there
in the simulation.
It's like a...
It's like a recreation.
But I saw that place.
And, Martin, I saw something
in it.
Something, uh...
You all right?
Look, I just, I wanted to say
that when you came to me
with all that stuff back then,
I was really harsh.
You mean when you said I was
clinically insane?
Yes.
Yeah.
You and Sam cut me off
completely.
Sorry.
But can you tell me again?
You had like all those handwritten
notepads with sketches.
Do you remember?
Yeah, I remember.
After we found your mom, it started.
I would sleepwalk.
- I'd wake up in the woods just shaking.
- Okay.
I had these terrors,
these nightmares,
so I would write, sketch them.
That's what I kept trying
to show you.
Things have gotten a lot worse
for me since then.
What do you mean worse?
Carly, what happened
to your arm?
I don't know.
It happened in the simulation.
I don't know.
I can't explain it,
but it's the same as hers.
So...
Please, Martin, I'm so confused.
Show me.
Now, I've never shown anyone
this before.
So this what I think
it is.
Demonic possession.
Out of all the research I've
done, all the bullshit I read,
this one seems like it could be
real.
It's said to haunt and torment
you for your entire life,
also influencing close friends
and other family members.
Accounts go back millennia.
See?
I think that sanitarium is built
on some sort of haunted land.
Now there are stories that date
back centuries
that connect to this piece
of land.
And everyone says
the same thing.
1889.
It was a fur trading post.
Accounts of bodily possessions,
murders, all documented.
Hey, look at this.
The first stage
of the infection.
The subject makes an amulet
using parts of a raven
like the one your mother made.
I don't know if it was fate
or just bad luck or what,
but she walked through
this thing's lair
and it snatched her right up,
possessed her body.
Just... just hear me out, okay?
In the Catholic church and in a lot
of sects of the Catholic church,
the idea of the demons are real
is just accepted as a fact.
I mean, it's not some
hypothetical "what if"
like the way we talk about it.
To them,
it is as real as air and water.
I'm talking demons.
The devil.
Real.
- Okay.
- So, one of the things that I read is that the Vatican
has basically been funding
a black ops unit.
Very well funded and well
equipped to hunt demons,
using hand-selected priests
like soldiers.
What I read is that the Vatican
has been buying up places
like Therapol.
And I mean exactly like
Therapol.
Private hospitals.
Small clinics that specialize
in disorders.
Things like comas.
Things that western medicine
will dismiss
as being explainable
when, in fact, it could be...
Possessions.
I think that the doctors
at Therapol,
I think they're priests.
And I think they're using
technology
to sniff out who's genuinely
possessed.
What do they do
with the possessed people?
An exorcism.
Now, I think they take the
people that have been possessed
back to the original place
it happened.
The demon gateway.
It's the only way it gets in
or out.
And I think they're gonna take
her back
to the sanitarium, Carly.
Are you sure that you haven't
been having
any hallucinations
or any visions?
And I mean outside
of the simulation,
because this is what it does,
Carly.
It shows you things.
And it makes you do things.
Yeah, okay, no.
I can't do this, sorry.
Carly.
Carly.
Just... would you listen to
me, please? Listen to me.
If you start having visions,
that means it's...
Carly!
It means it's coming for ya.
- Hey, babe!
- Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck?
Sam, Jesus.
You could've killed me.
You just let yourself in?
Yeah, chill out.
- God, sorry.
- No, no, no.
I can't do this tonight, Sam.
- No, I'm sorry.
- What, no, sit down.
No, I'm not gonna sit down,
okay?
I'm sorry.
I need you to leave, please.
- Have you eaten?
- Sam.
Sam.
I need you to go.
Carly.
What's going on?
I just came from Martin's
house, okay,
because I saw Angela today.
- You saw your mother...
- And I don't wanna talk about it, okay?
I need some space
to think, so...
- All right.
- That's what I need.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Um, yeah.
- Totally get it.
- Thank you.
- I will leave on one condition.
- What?
That you will call me
if you need anything.
I will be here in five minutes.
Okay.
Are you sure you're okay?
Okay.
Babe?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hi, I'm sorry.
I was just so worried
about you, okay?
- I couldn't sleep.
- I told you.
I told you I just needed
some space.
I know, but I was just really
concerned.
Why are you banging on the door?
- What time is it?
- I don't know.
It's like 3:00 a.m.
or something.
You crazy ho.
What are you doing?
You're the one with the fucking
kitchen knife.
So yeah, I'm not gonna
stay long, babe.
I just wanted to come and check
on you.
Thank you.
- I appreciate it.
- Well...
You are my BFF.
I know.
Thanks.
Also...
I wanted to show you
a little trick that I can do.
- What?
- Yeah, it's just...
It's just a little trick
I can do
and I wanted you to see it.
Okay, wait.
Just wait, Carly.
Don't be scared.
Remember if you can't find me,
Carly,
you can look for me
in the woods.
Okay?
What are you saying, Sam?
Oh, it's just, um...
Look, Carly.
Just look.
Look, Carly.
Look.
No!
It was just a dream. It was just a dream.
It was just a dream.
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Fuck.
Come on, pick up.
- Come on, pick up.
- Hey, this is Sam. Leave a message, I guess.
Fuck.
Hey, this is Sam.
Leave a message, I guess.
Look at her.
That is absolute terror.
It's become obsessed with her.
Completely obsessed.
Trapped in her mother's head
in a coma.
Nothing but memories
of this girl in every direction.
- It wants her.
- I don't like it.
We should contact her.
Offer protection, bring her in.
No, no, no, no.
It has chosen who it wants.
Like they always fucking do.
Gold team, take the patient down
to the vehicle. Get her intubated.
We're gonna be heading out
to the sanitarium ASAP.
We'll see you on level two.
Roger that, sir.
Come on, Sam.
Hey, this is Sam.
Leave a message, I guess.
Fuck.
Sam.
Sam.
Sam, are you here?
It's Carly.
Fuck.
Fucking kidding me.
Sam.
This is 9-1-1.
State your type of emergency.
I think something may have
happened to my friend.
Her front door was open
and the power's out
and she isn't answering
her phone.
Okay, don't enter the house.
Please provide me
your location.
There's no signs
of forced entry.
Okay, yeah.
I didn't know.
The power's out.
She have a husband, boyfriend,
anyone staying here with her?
No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.
She was just here alone.
Just gonna check upstairs first.
Okay.
Sam!
Fuck.
Come on, Sam, where are you?
How old is she?
Ma'am?
- How old is she?
- Sorry. Uh, 38.
Okay. Well, there's no signs
of forced entry.
There's no obvious suspect.
What?
What are you talking about?
We'll give it 48 hours
and if it's necessary,
we'll open up
a missing persons...
48 hour...
Yes, yes, it's necessary.
Can't we just do that now?
Something has happened to her.
Please?
Look, I understand how you
feel, ma'am.
I also know that almost all
these calls resolve in 48 hours.
Hey, I suggest get a good sleep.
She'll probably show up
in the morning.
Okay.
Hey, hey.
I'm really sorry that I left
like that before.
I know it's like 3:30
in the morning, too.
That's... That's okay.
You wanna come in?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I just I didn't know
where else to go.
Don't worry about it,
it's all right.
So what happened?
What's going on?
It's Sam.
She's missing.
- The police won't open a case.
- Hold on a second.
- What do you mean the police?
- I don't know. She's missing, okay?
- I don't know.
- Okay.
Okay, hey, just slow down.
Come on, come sit down.
Am I crazy?
I had a nightmare.
I swear it was real.
It feels like it happened.
Sam was in it.
She told me to look for her
in the woods
if I couldn't find her.
In the dream, she said that.
When I woke up, I called her
and there was no answer
and I know that she should be
home.
So I went there
to where she's staying
and she wasn't there.
The house was open.
The doors were wide open.
That's what used to
happen to me.
The dreams, the woods.
I mean, Sam must be trying to
tell you where she is.
With that thing.
Always back to that fucking
building.
That goddamn building.
Wait.
You think it's actually true?
Something she told me
in a dream?
She's actually there?
I mean, we have to go there.
No fucking way.
Well, then I have to go.
- I have to get her.
- And do what?
I don't know.
I just, I know I have to try.
- Why is this even a discussion?
- Carly, you can't just go up there.
Think about it for a second.
Just wait, wait, wait, wait, think.
- Just think it through.
- Get out of my way.
It lures you, right?
Years later.
Decades later.
It uses everything you care
about.
Your friends, your family.
It fucks with them.
It sends them visions.
It's fucking with you.
Don't you get that?
It wants you to go up there.
You wanna end up like your mother?
Do you wanna burn people?
Sam stood by me
when no one else did.
I have to go. I have to.
I don't have a choice.
God damn it, you're forcing me
to go up there with you.
- Yeah.
- All right.
That's her car.
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, no, no.
You stay here.
- She there?
- No.
You see that?
What is that?
Sam.
Sam.
Sam.
Carly, Carly.
What?
You see?
- What?
- There.
Hey.
Hey, Sam.
Hey. It's me.
It's Carly.
It's Carly, Sam. Okay?
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's me.
It's Carly.
Okay?
Let's get out of here, okay?
I saw things.
I saw myself.
Okay.
I was burning alive.
Let's go, okay?
Sam, come on, let's go.
Come on, Sam.
How did I get here?
- Did I drive here?
- Yes, yes.
Okay, all right, we gotta go.
Let's go, come on.
All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.
It's okay.
They took her.
They took Angela.
She's in there.
- Wait.
- The men, they took her.
They took her into the building.
She's there.
She's just in there.
- What?
- Just keep her walking. Please, come on.
Sam, what do you mean?
Tell me what you mean.
Sam, are you sure it was Angela?
I just need to sleep,
please.
- Come on.
- Let's get you in there. Get you in there.
Okay, let's get out of here.
No, no, wait.
- Wait.
- What do you mean wait?
We have her, we have Sam.
We gotta go, we gotta go.
- Let's go, we're going.
- No, no.
Angela is up there.
You heard what she said.
Listen to me.
It's luring you
and now it's using
the visions it's given Sam
to get you
to go back into that building.
Carly, please don't do this.
If this is all true,
then I abandoned her.
You know she's innocent.
I can't leave her here.
It's all right, you can go,
okay?
It's all right.
If you're going,
I'm going with ya.
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.
What the fuck happened here?
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.
I mean, that guy needs help,
right?
Unless he's dead.
Fucking no reception.
Jesus.
Okay, listen. We're gonna leave Sam
right here and we're gonna go in.
We're gonna find Angela.
And if we don't find her
after 10 minutes,
we're leaving, okay?
Shit.
Hey, another guy.
What the fuck
is going on?
Wait.
That's the simulation.
That's what I saw in the clinic.
They're exorcists.
Oh, God.
Hey, Carly.
I think he's still alive.
I recognize him.
Daniel. Daniel.
Hey, it's Carly.
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?
First aid kit.
I can do medical attention.
No, it's all over.
- Don't.
- Daniel, where is she?
Where's Angela?
Is she here?
We always bring the possessed
back to the place of infection.
The simulation let us go into
the mind of the possessed
to draw the thing out.
We took all precautions,
but it jumped from her
into Michael.
Now that it's free,
it won't stop coming for you, Carly.
The holy lance.
It's been in the Vatican
for 1,000 years.
Take it, Carly.
It's the only thing
that will kill it.
How do I help my mom?
What do I do?
Load into the simulation
and try to help get her out,
but I think she's too far gone.
The simulation is active now.
Follow the cables.
- Go.
- Everything's spent.
There's no ammo.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
Listen to me.
If it takes me, shoot me.
You understand?
I can't go through
what she went through.
Okay?
Okay.
- Ugh. What stinks?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- You see that?
- Yeah, what is that?
Fuck.
Where is this motherfucker?
Jesus.
Okay, here we go.
This is insane.
Mom.
What do you do?
I go in
and I try to get her out.
Can you pass me that?
The head thing.
- Yeah.
- The thing right there.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm gonna keep guard.
But you do this fast, okay?
Yes. Yeah.
Hey.
Thank you, Martin.
Mom.
Mom, it's me.
Mom, please where are you?
Who's there?
Hey.
All right, motherfucker,
stop right there.
I'm not gonna ask again.
Stop.
Fuck. Come on!
Let's go.
Mom.
Mom, hey, it's me.
It's Carly.
Carly.
Carly.
No, my baby, you can't be here.
You must go.
You must be safe.
I know it left me in here,
but now it's gone.
They're out there where you are.
Mom, come.
Come on, you can't stay here,
okay?
You can join me outside.
Do you know what this place is?
No, I've never been here.
It was a house I always
imagined for us.
A more idyllic place
for you to grow up.
Now it's just a bunch
of rotting memories.
Decaying dreams.
A future that never happened.
I failed you.
No, you didn't.
You didn't. I...
I understand now.
Okay? Mom.
Mom.
I need you to come with me.
Okay?
I need to get you out of here,
please.
I'm not strong enough
to go out there.
Not anymore.
Mom, I can help you
out there in the world.
I can help you.
I can look after you, please.
No.
I'm at peace now.
All I ask is that there's no more pain.
You go out.
You live.
Live a life of love and happiness.
And you leave all this behind.
- I'm sorry for the years we lost.
- No.
But I got to see you
one more time.
No, Mom. Mom, don't.
No.
No.
No, please don't do this.
Please don't do this, Mom, no.
Mom, no, please.
Martin.
Martin.
I'm sorry.
Martin.
Martin.
No, fuck.
Daniel. Daniel.
Fuck.
Oh, God.
No. No. No.
S-Sam.
This can't be happening.
This can't be real.
I'm so sorry, Sam.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. God.
- Carly.
It's... it's here for you.
It's waiting. It's a trap.
You have to go.
No, no, no.
I'm not leaving you, okay?
I'm not leaving you.
Go. Go!
Go!
Martin, Martin.
Did you know that I like to
burn things?
I burn all their weapons.
All their crucifixes
and their bibles.
All their guns.
But really, Marty...
I like to burn people.
And I think when I come back
in her body...
Mm.
I will burn you.
You leave her alone.
No!
No, you leave her!
Leave her!
Fuck! No, no.
Oh.
You are my new home.
Fuck you!
What the fuck is this?
Where the fuck did you get it?
Submit to me.
Die!
Obey me.
No.
What have you done?
Die!
Hey.
I got you these.
Thanks. Uh...
They're lovely.
How you feeling?
The doctor said you're healing
really well.
Yeah, I'm okay.
They say you'll get to go home
by the end of the week.
Yeah.
Well, did you want a ride?
I'll drive you home.
I'll come check on you.
I'll bring you
chicken noodle soup.
Cups of pudding. Is that what you like, pudding?
Don't make me laugh.
