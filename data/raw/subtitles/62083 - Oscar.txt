What is it?
- I want to see Mr. Barnier.
- Do you have an appointment?
No, but I have something 
very important to tell him.
At 8h in the morning,
Monsieur is not awake.
This is very urgent.
Alright, but I'll never 
finish my cleaning
Coming!
Mr. went to bed late and is not 
to be disturbed before 11 h.
I have great news he 
will like to hear.
- But...
- I take full responsibility.
Tell him Christian Martin 
is here to see him.
What is it?
- It's Mr. Martin.
- Who?
Mr. Christian Martin.
What does he want?
He has something very
important to tell you.
Alright, I'll tell him
Tell me
Does Mr. Barnier
have breakfast?
- Yes of course.
- Bring another cup.
No, no, no...
- Very well.
- Tell me.
Very well.
How will you let 
me know?
- Do you have a buzzer?
- No we don't.
With the tray I'll 
bring a bell.
But tell me...
That's Mr. Barnier.
What happened? 
Is it a catastrophe?
No, monsieur!
So why do you intrude at 8
in the morning in my home?
- A reason of major importance.
- That could not...
- ...wait until afternoon?
- No.
Come with me.
Alright,
I'm listening.
Mr. Barnier, I know you 
are a kind-hearted man.
You are like a father for
your employees, so...
Listen, hurry up and come 
to the point, please.
- ...what's wrong?
- Everything is fine.
Then, what are you 
doing here?
I came to ask for 
a raise.
Tell me, are you 
making fun of me?
I wouldn't dare.
So you have the nerve to 
wake me at 8 in the...
- ...morning for that?
- If you knew...
I don't want to know.
My life depends on it.
If everyone came here to tell
the story of his life!
I should fire you!
I would like to explain 
the reasons...
You will explain at 
the office!
So your answer is...
...unfavourable?
Dear young man...
...something is not alright
with you this morning.
I advise you to leave right now 
and prepare your apology...
...for this afternoon.
- The breakfast!
- But that's not bad.
2 cups?
That young man said he'd 
have breakfast with you.
- What young man?
- That young man
I didn't expect our talk 
to be so brief...
Are you crazy?
I'm in love.
So what?
I'll ask for her hand 
this morning.
I'm not interested in 
your love-life.
Love-life is often 
linked to finances.
Oh, yes!
Could you please...
...return to the... Ouch!
And so?
I cannot propose to 
her, if I cannot...
...provide for her 
in the fashion...
...her parents provided 
for her in the past.
Let's finish this.
How much do you earn...
3000 F per month 
plus bonuses.
And how much would you like?
6000 F per month.
Arm up.
I can leave you some minutes
to think about it.
I have thought it over.
Try to understand me.
I understand your surprise.
Mr. Barnier, I started 
working for you...
... 2 years ago for a salary 
of 500 F per month.
This is the limit!
Some sugar, please.
Thanks.
2!
Thanks.
By asking 6000 you waste your
time and make me waste mine.
Your company is one of the most...
...profitable in europe.
Thanks to you?
Partially.
So you think you're
indispensable?
No one is indispensable,
but first I would like to 
talk to you about love.
- To me?
- Oh, monsieur!
As I said, I am going to ask for 
the permission to get married.
- So what?
- I am not addressing...
...a businessman, but a man 
with a great heart.
Let's not overdo it...
I know you.
My good heart will not give 
you 6000 F par month!
Life is tough for a 
young couple...
...I talked about that 
yesterday with...
- ...Mr. Muller.
- Mr. Muller?
You know him?
He was a bit worried
about having us...
- ...as competitors.
- So that's it!
He asked me how much I earned, 
very understanding...
I know his methods.
He doesn't scare me, 
tell him that!
Barnier, trembling
because of Muller!
- To the contrary!
- Of course!
One day I will squish him.
- Soon.
- Very soon!
Just imagine when he finds
out about my raise.
I'm laughing already.
I'll call him right now.
To do what?
To tell him about my raise...
Wait.
Let's think about it.
Let's not rush into anything.
Tell me about your fianc√©e.
She is lovely.
Her parents?
Oh! Charming people!
- Well situated?
- Very well.
That's why 3000 F per month
won't be enough for her.
Yes.
Well, listen, oh... 
let's say...
5500 and not another word.
That's more than...
- ...I would have thought.
- If I had known that.
So I will stay with you.
That's very nice of you.
Since you promised me 
5500 F per month.
- Now that I have said it.
- I'll talk to her father...
I keep my promises, 
so go on!
Thanks.
- Good luck!
- Thanks.
I ask you for the hand of 
your daughter.
What!?
Yes, monsieur.
No?
Yes!
Oh!
Those flowers are 
for Mrs. Barnier.
Put that away...
...you! Come!
Go on!
Move, fast!
Sit down, there!
Bernadette, out.
Very well...
How...
...come...
Get out now!
How come you know 
my daughter?
We met 1 1/2 years ago quite 
by chance at the racing club.
I didn't know it was her...
...so when I found out,
I didn't tell her it was me.
- Come again?
- I didn't dare to tell her...
...that I earned only 1000 F
working for her father.
Now that's something!
You can say that again!
You're a charming young man...
...but I had hoped for a more 
advantageous marriage for my daughter.
So why don't you make me...
...sales manager?
Neither that title nor your 
salary of 5500 F per month...
...will give her the lifestyle
she is used to.
I have heard you were going to
give her a dowry...
...of 40 millions?
Who told you that?
She did.
1, that's absolutely false.
2, I find that a very 
peculiar mentality.
You want to marry my daughter 
just to make some money!
I want to marry her not because 
of money but because I love her.
If she got a large dowry,
that wouldn't be a...
...reason to break up.
I find your reasoning odd...
...and particularly obnoxious.
To prove the purity of my 
financial intentions...
...I will present her with my 
whole fortune.
- Your fortune!
- 64723000 F.
What?
I said: 64723000 F...
or 647230 F...
- ...if you prefer new Francs.
- You?
Me.
You inherited it?
No.
I stole it...
- ...from you.
- What?
I said:
I stole it from you!
- Me?
- You!
- That's not possible.
- Yes, I assure you.
That not possible!!!
I will explain.
You must be joking!
I wouldn't dare.
Monsieur?
Bring 2 aspirines for Monsieur.
- He doesn't feel well?
- Hurry!
Who would have believed it?
Noone, so I thaught 
it would surprise you.
So you are giving yourself up?
Why should I?
I'm calling the police.
But what for?
To have you thrown in prison!
If all you're saying is true... 
I can't believe it.
Your aspirine, Mr. Barnier.
- Leave me alone!
- I insist.
Are you going to make fun 
of me for much longer!
Be ready to bring it back 
in a moment.
I still have some news...
...to announce to Mr. Barnier.
64723000 F!
- What will you do?
- I'm going to call the police.
Think about it...
...I didn't try to run away.
A gentlemen's agreement might 
be preferable for you.
An arrangement with a thief!
Your company declared...
...a profit of 31228000 F.
And you know that I 
concealed 47 millions...
...which the tax authorities 
never heard of.
How do you explain that theft...
...when nothing is missing...
- ...in your accounting?
- What?
And that's so bad.
Your financial situation 
is fantastic.
They will check your accounting.
The police will ask...
...you all sorts of questions.
How will you answer?
How did you steal...
...64723000 F without putting 
your hand in the till?
With the doorknobs.
What do you want?
- The bell.
- Put it over there!
Where was I?
You said...
What did you say?
I don't remember.
That's great!
Oh yes! The doorknobs 
helped me.
Oh, That's it!
Do you know how many 
doorknobs we sold at our...
...last construction project?
64723000 doorknobs.
So what?
After a thorough survey of 
the manufacturing problems...
...I got a reduction of 
1 F per doorknob.
So what!
A typing error in the contract 
and the reduction was not 1 F but 2.
I wanted to tell you, but you 
had left already.
- I had to leave for the subway.
- What did you want there?
I met your daughter there.
- So?
- I realized that this error would...
...save our happiness if I could 
manage to keep it secret.
Even more business not 
recorded in the accounting!
Shh!
The telephone.
That explains the number 
of 64723000 F...
...I told you earlier.
- That you put in your pocket.
- That's too small.
You're not funny!
I acted out of love for 
your daughter...
...to whom I will return,
if she marries me...
...the entire sum.
With her dowry of 40 millions, 
you see...
...a couple that starts off
with a 100 millions.
And as parents worry about...
...the future of their children,
you will have nothing...
...to worry about.
That is all somehow logical, but 
you are still going pretty far!
Does my daughter know about 
all this?
Of course not!
I have to lie to her...
She thinks I'm a vice-president.
Did you know I'm rather shy?
No, I didn't notice.
Does she, uh...
Does she love you?
I think so.
I can even say I'm sure of it.
She has given me proof
What proof?
What are you still doing 
with that bell?
I'm calling for the aspirin.
You and your aspirin!
I hate to conceal things.
You have proven that.
Can we talk about it 
man to man?
Yes.
I am your daughter's lover.
What?
Monsieur?
Get out!
Very well.
Not you.
Me!
Or better not!
You stay! And you leave!
Sorry, I didn't understand.
Who leaves and who stays?
Think about it in the kitchen.
Very well.
So?
Well.
So my daughter has a lover.
For how long?
About 1 and 1/2 years.
You didn't lose any time!
What?
Since you have known her for 
1 1/2 years and have been...
...her lover for 1 1/2 years,
you didn't lose any time.
I have known her for 1 year,
6 months and 4 days.
I have been her lover for...
...1 year, 5 months and 22 days.
It was a rainy sunday.
That explains all.
But you haven't lost any time.
I hope you decided to get 
married immediately?
No, we immediately decided 
to get married.
Do you see the difference?
Oh!
Leave me in peace!
Why has she never told me?
- She was afraid of you.
- My daughter afraid of me?
That's something!
She will explain right away!
I promised your daughter 
to say nothing.
I have to clear up this
matter immediately!
Bring it up carefully.
That way she can confess to you.
Do it right away.
I will return in 1/4 h
to embrace Mrs Barnier.
Why do you want to 
embrace my wife?
It's normal to embrace my 
mother in law.
First I have to talk to 
my daughter.
Thank you, monsieur.
Mr. Barnier, let me call 
you Bertrand.
Oh no!
Oh no!
Another catastrophe?
This time, it's for me.
I've got a headache 
from all this.
Well, see you later.
Goodbye, Bertrand.
He calls you Bertrand?
Handle him with care.
Goodbye, Bertrand.
Colette!
Yes, daddy.
What is it, my duck?
Don't call me animal names!
But that's nice, a duck.
You don't call your father that!
You're old-fashioned, daddy.
And you, you are a bit too modern!
I've just heard everything 
about it.
What have you heard?
Everything!
About what?
Don't play innocent!
And I demand some explanations!
About what?
About your lover!
About your mother.
About your lover, now talk!
He came to ask for your hand.
He came to...
ask for my hand?
He left just now.
This time I mean it. 
I haven't heard from him...
...in 2 weeks. I thaught he 
had abandoned me.
That's all we would have needed!
Mum was just going to tell you.
- She knows what's going on?
- Yes.
So I'm the last one to be 
informed what's going on!
So you agree?
Agree to what?
- That we get married.
- We're not so far yet.
Until you prove the contrary, 
you are not married yet.
If you continue 
with that noise...
...I'll put you in boarding 
school in a convent!
Until you are of full age!
And where?
In the Auvergne!
Miss!
He doesn't want me 
to get married.
I'm fed up with it.
I want to live freely.
Here, I waste...
...my youth.
I heard a story of girl who 
made her parents believe... 
...she was pregnant in order
to get their consent.
My father would have 
a heart-attack!
Yes, but once the attack is 
over he would have to accept.
It would be too late 
to change anything.
I'd never dare.
Still continuing that?
I have to talk to you.
Later.
I'm listening.
It will surprise you.
I've been surprised 
all morning long...
Dad.
We will call him Blaise.
Who?
His child.
Whose child?
- Ours
- Yours?
Our own child!
Don't you understand...
No.
That's not possible!
No! That's not possible!
I didn't understand!
That's all too much 
for the morning!
Tell me that's not true!
You won't call him Blaise!
Monsieur?
Bring me 3 aspirin right away.
- Already prepared.
- Thanks.
Blaise!
You permit the marriage?
I've got to.
Thank you Dad!
I'll tell Mum the good news.
- It's ringing.
- Hmm.
- It's ringing!
One second, I'll get it.
Oh, sorry!
Mr. Barnier, please.
A young lady to see you, Monsieur.
I don't have time!
I'll tell her.
- She's not there any more.
- She is here.
- She was there.
- Not now.
Miss?
- Mr. Barnier?
- Until further notice.
I am in a desperate situation.
Me too, if that cheers you up!
I'm in love with...
...a certain Christian Martin.
That is a problem.
Why?
Because he just asked me if 
he could marry my daughter.
That's terrible!
I understand, but you 
are still young...
I must confess something: 
I lied to Christian.
- I told him I was your daughter.
- But that's not so bad.
He believes you are my father!
Of course, if you 
told him that!
Don't you understand?
No.
Oh, now I understand!
- About marrying your daughter...
- I have understood!
- He meant me.
- What a morning!
And my daughter expecting
a child!
Please don't tell Christian
the truth yet. Let me...
- ...do that myself.
- I bet!
Stand right there.
Now, why did you choose me
as your father?
I'm not rich. My mother works for 
her living and Christian has...
- ...a very good position.
- I know.
- My name is Bouillotte.
- Oh, go on!
When I saw an advertising
sign for "Barnier"...
...I told him:
my name is Jacqueline Barnier.
When he asked if I was 
the building contractor's...
...daughter, I said yes.
- What did he answer?
- "That's funny"
In fact, irresistible!
I would like to tell him 
the truth myself.
If he finds out you are not
my daughter...
...I lose my 60 million!
What are you saying?
I don't mind at all 
to tell him...
...nothing if you agree 
to stay here until I have...
...had the time to clear 
some matters with him.
Anything you want.
You better hide in there!
Stay there until I come 
back to get you.
- You won't tell him anything? 
- Promised if you don't move.
- Thank you! 
- I'll be right back.
And now, I would really 
like to know what pig...
...made my daughter pregnant!
Germaine!
Germaine!
Who is calling?
Me, your husband.
Ah, good.
I need to talk to you.
Yes?
- Your daughter has a lover.
- Me too.
- What?
- I have to talk to you as well.
I'm listening.
Your daughter has a lover.
- I just told you that.
- I already knew it.
And you also know that she is
going to have a child?
Of course.
Now that's great!
It's the destiny of all women!
Good, you're broad-minded!
Hey!
Don't hide!
I've seen you.
Come out of there!
Who is it?
Who is it?
You know him, he came to 
ask you for my hand.
I want you to pronounce 
his name.
To hear the music...
Who is it?
It's Oscar.
Oscar?
Who's that, Oscar?
Now you're losing your memory,
he's your driver!
You are expecting...
...a child from my driver!
Would you prefer her to have
several lovers.
Good god, what have I done 
to deserve a fate like this?
I don't see what is so bad.
Our daughter is going to 
marry a decent boy.
Invite him for lunch 
immediately.
How can I invite him? 
I fired him 2 weeks ago!
There, there my little girl...
...your daddy will fix
everything.
My daughter, dishonoured 
by my driver!
I rather see her seduced 
by an attractive driver...
than that Baron de la Butini√®re
you wanted her to marry.
That pimpleface.
My darling, go and cry 
in your room.
And close your window because 
of the neighbours.
Mrs. Barnier, allow me 
to call you Mum!
Why did he call me Mum?
What are you saying?
Why did he call me "Mum"?
Why Mum, huh?
- Doesn't she know?
- Know what?
The proposal.
What is all this about?
Didn't he tell you I just asked 
for your daughter's hand?
- Colette?
- No.
- The other one.
- Which other one?
- The younger one!
- What?
- The younger one!
- Are you going crazy?
Go to your room, I have to...
...talk to this young man.
Yes, I think you are both not...
...completely OK this morning.
I didn't know you had...
- ...2 daughters.
- Neither did I.
- What?
- My wife is excited.
She doesn't know what 
she is saying.
Let's talk about serious 
things again.
In my office.
I don't want to talk any more
about how you got that money.
But if you should change 
your mind, I would like...
...to have your guarantee
that you return...
...the money to my daughter.
- Are you doubting my word?
- Not at all!
If you could give me a cheque...
...it would be much 
easier for me...
...to convince my wife...
...who is not very happy 
about this marriage.
You can imagine I wouldn't 
put that money into a bank.
Where is it?
Converted to jewels.
Where are they?
In a suitcase in a 
safe place.
In a suitcase!
- I have an idea.
- That's not possible!
Yes! Sit down.
We will...
...surprise Colette.
No Jacqueline,
the younger one.
You will get those jewels and
give them to her...
...as an engagement present.
That way, her mother won't 
be able to refuse.
- You think so?
- I guarantee it!
I'm off!
No, no, wait, Christian!
Have you heard anything about Oscar?
- Your driver?
- Former driver.
- You don't know what happened?
- What?
A great disappointment in love!
That's not possible.
He wouldn't tell her name,
a charming girl, but her 
father was impossible.
You think so?
The poor boy.
Don't say he commited suicide!
Almost the same:
He left on a polar expedition.
That's terrible.
Gone for 6 years!
See you later.
I need to talk to you
- That's not the right moment.
- It's very urgent.
Come over here.
I'm listening.
I wanted to tell you I cannot 
stay in your service any longer.
Now that's just what I had 
been waiting for.
- Why are you leaving?
- I'm getting married.
You're lucky.
To whom?
- You know him well.
- I do?
- He came here very often.
- Who is it?
Honor√© de la Butini√®re.
That's not possible!
Pimpleface?
He doesn't have 
pimples any more.
How do you explain that?
If you don't understand.
No, I don't get it.
Bernadette!
Please leave this 
house immediately!
I don't like that kind of joke.
Pack your bags immediately.
Get out of my sight!
Very well.
Germaine!
What is it?
- Do you know the news?
- No.
Honor√© de la Butini√®re does 
not have pimples any more.
Why do you tell me that?
You know why?
No.
Ask the maid.
Bertrand.
Everytime I see you I wonder 
if you're still normal?
Anyway, I fired her.
- Now that's intelligent!
- Thanks.
- There's something worse.
- What?
- Oscar is gone.
- Where?
Some expedition to the 
Arctic or the Antarctic.
- Gone for 6 years!
- Look what you have done!
And that's my fault!
Of course. Find her 
another husband.
How, in my condition...
You told me...
...a young man
came to ask for...
...Colette's hand?
- Yes.
- Who is it?
- Martin.
- Your Martin?
Everything's arranged then.
No, he is already engaged.
Is he engaged or did he ask 
for your daughter's hand?
He didn't know it was her.
Explain to me in an clear and
intelligible fashion.
Some things can't be explained.
That young man who was 
here earlier...
...what was his name?
- Martin.
- Him too?
But that's the same one.
Now I see why he called me Mum.
- It's all clear to me now.
- Good luck.
Keep away from the suitcases!
- I'm happy to see you again. 
- Yes, yes.
- Are the jewels in there? 
- Yes, yes.
No!
Let's close it,
that's safer.
Dear Christian, we will 
call him Blaise.
Who?
Our little child.
What child?
Your child!
Don't you understand?
- No!
- Yes!
Why hasn't Jacqueline told 
me about it?
It's the latest news, she 
just told me this morning.
Mr. Barnier, allow me 
to embrace you.
There is one small thing 
that disturbs me.
What is it?
I don't know how to explain it.
- Tell me.
- Oh well, alright.
Before you can get married...
...there will have to be a 
certain minimum delay.
Yes.
No one is safe from accidents.
When you leave here, you...
- ...could be run over.
- You, too.
Not me.
I lost a cousin like that,
it was terrible!
What would become of my daughter 
if that happened to you?
And what would become of 
my grand-son?
My little baby wouldn't even 
be able to call himself Martin.
I'm asking myself 
what we could do.
I will see a notary.
Let's not disturb a notary 
for such a small thing!
You write me a little 
piece of paper...
...I'm sure that will be enough.
If ever something bad 
should happen to you.
I understand, I will write 
something for you.
Let's do it right away and 
not think about it any more.
Here...
...something to write.
Why that face?
You don't seem to 
fully trust me.
Who? Me?
Yes, those papers,
those jewels...
Will I get them back after 
I've married your daughter?
If you're worried about that,
I am willing to sign...
...an agreement myself.
You get the good chair.
- That, over here!
- No, over here.
It's better here.
Here, fine.
Now write!
We write at the same time.
Yes... Oh, ooooh!
Wait.
Let's see.
So, you write!
"I, the undersigned
Christian...
...Barnier...
...acknowledge...
...that I am the father...
...of 64 millions...
...awaited by
Miss Barnier."
Now sign it.
- You sign yours, too.
- Well, sign yours!
- Perfect.
- You give me yours.
- Who?
- Give me yours!
Now let's proceed to more...
- ...amusing matters.
- Oh yes?
Let's surprise my daughter!
My dear Christian!
Wait for me here,
I will talk to my daughter.
- You haven't told her anything?
- Not yet.
You will see her face when 
she hears about the news!
That will be fun!
Miss.
Christian has just arrived.
Better tell him the 
truth yourself.
When everything is cleared up,
thank him on my behalf...
...for returning my suitcase.
- What suitcase?
- He will understand.
I will get him.
Christian!
I think you won't 
love me anymore.
That's impossible.
- I have to tell you the truth.
- I have a confession, too.
- Me first!
- No, me!
- Mine will surprise you much more.
- I don't think so.
Well here we go.
I have been working for...
...father for 2 years!
I am not his daughter.
Don't you understand?
Mr. Barnier is not my father.
That doesn't matter to me.
Does he know?
Of course!
That's just great.
What does he say about that?
He asked me to thank you for
returning his suitcase.
Wait, what exactly 
did he tell you?
When we met, you told me 
about your good position...
Yes.
I didn't dare to tell you 
I was just a typist...
when you asked about 
my family name...
You are not Barnier's daughter?
That's what I was trying 
to tell you!
- He wants to keep the suitcase?
- Yes.
That's abominable.
He has tricked me!
Is that all the love 
you have for me!
Jacqueline!
Jacqueline!
Don't look for them,
here they are!
You see what you have done.
Are you happy now?
I'm very happy, thank you.
You knew Jacqueline was 
not your daughter?
What a stupid question.
You are very clever.
- Not as clever as you.
- Of course not, but still.
You know I keep my word.
I promised you to give 
these to my daughter.
- If you keep your promise.
- Which is?
- To marry my daughter.
- The real one?
- Why should I marry her?
- You asked for her hand.
- I didn't know who she was!
- Your mistake.
So it's a package:
the girl and the suitcase.
With a small bonus
as encouragement.
No, thanks. Keep everything.
Son, you forget that 
you signed me a paper.
You are the father of my
daughter's child.
She awaits a child?
Those things happen.
So why doesn't she marry 
the real father?
- He has disappeared.
- So you chose me as father.
You are a scoundrel, Mr. Barnier!
Yes.
I thought we would 
understand each other.
I still have to introduce you.
Colette! Germaine!
You called me, daddy?
Look at her.
She is charming!
Colette, I'd like...
...you to meet 
Christian Martin...
...your future husband.
How happy they are!
Have you explained the 
situation to Mr. Martin?
Yes, everything, and he 
is very cooperative.
Not as handsome as Oscar, 
but better than nothing.
When you open your mouth, 
only nonsense comes out.
So Oscar is responsible?
I'd say it's my husband 
who is really responsible.
Germaine!
Let's leave the two alone.
So they have time to get 
to know each other.
Get some fresh air in 
the park. It's lovely.
See you later...
...my dear Christian.
Listen, Bertrand.
One more word, just one, 
and you can take care...
...of this all by yourself and
she marries the first best man.
Listen, Bertrand.
You are awaiting a 
child from Oscar.
And you want me to become...
...the father?
Alright, my situation forces 
me to give in...
...but I warn you...
...we won't see each 
other very often.
Great!
I'll marry so that I can do 
what I want, to be a free woman.
You just want to be married, 
no matter with who?
I prefer a handsome guy.
Good! I'm out of the running, then.
Why? You're not that bad.
I have understood,
I won't get away.
Miss, see you at the wedding.
Funny, I was going to ring
but the door opens before.
- Philippe Dubois.
- Sorry?
- I'm Mr. Barnier's masseur.
- Christian Martin.
Sorry, you wouldn't be a 
champion of some sort?
3 times Apollon, the most handsome 
athlete's body in France.
All the women must adore you.
You are not married, I suppose?
- Oh no.
- Good. Nice to meet you!
- Did you fall down?
- I hit on something very interesting.
- What do you think?
- That's dad's masseur.
Good, come.
If I was a woman and had to
chose between him and me...
- ...I wouldn't hesitate.
- He is not bad.
He looks so intelligent!
Oh yes!
Why don't you marry him 
instead of me?
- Nobody asked me what I want. 
- Go.
Ah! Miss Colette!
Don't mind us, we are not here.
But sure, you are here.
Don't mind us, we...
- ...are not here!
- OK.
Yes, they are still there.
That's your chance, use it.
Alright?
Oh... yes!
I'll tell your father.
Charles!
Sir?
Charles! Mr. Barnier?
So you agree?
I discovered how your daughter...
- ...feels deep in her heart.
- Bravo, congratulations!
Colette... You allow 
me to call her Colette?
Of course, my son.
- She is madly in love.
- Perfect!
- With your masseur.
- What?
- Philippe Dubois.
- That idiot?
Colette must get married.
She would prefer
Mr. Idiot ah...
Mr. Dubois!
The suitcase!
The suitcase!
Colette!
Is it true what he told me...
...about the masseur?
He is up there!
I don't care, he doesn't 
understand anything!
So is it true?
Yes, daddy.
She finds I am 
not at all her type.
No, not at all.
If she prefers Mr. Dubois
or someone else...
That changes all my plans!
No. You give me my paper and
I let you keep the suitcase.
Keep calm. If it doesn't...
...work out with him,
I need you as a spare.
Come back later. If everything...
...is arranged, you get 
your paper back...
...and we can settle accounts
before we separate.
Since you let me go, I should 
first tell you about...
...all the export problems.
Things are rather bad.
Oh yes?
- It's not going well.
- No!
It could even become 
catastrophic.
We must absolutely come up
with a solution.
I may have been a little hasty.
Consider yourself 
still my employee.
Take care of those...
...export issues.
- Please sign some papers for that.
- Whenever you wish.
- Right now, over there, on the table.
- Yes.
Everything will be fine.
To open the frozen account...
- ...with the EFAC.
- Yes.
Tax excemptions for...
- ...imports with the SCUF.
- Yes.
- Customs declaration SMOF.
- Mmm.
And here you put:
- "Read and approved"
- Where?
- Here. Read and approved.
- And approved.
Now sign it.
Miss.
That boy is great. It's a 
shame you don't want him.
I prefer the other one!
Shut it!
I'll try to convince him.
- Hey, I'm here!
- Oh!
Hello, Mr. Barnier.
- How do you feel?
- Not bad.
How are your stomach muscles?
A little whisky?
Never any alcohol.
- A coffee?
- Never any coffee.
Some lemon juice?
I'd prefer a glass of milk.
We'll see about that.
Philippe, imagine I have...
...a serious problem.
Still the pain in your shoulder?
I will massage you.
Careful!
Still so sensitive?
My suitcase!
Oh, my suitcase.
Is that alright?
That's fine.
What's that?
Excuse me, Sir.
- Still here!
- I was packing my suitcase.
Get out. I have seen 
enough of you!
I would like you to pay me
for the last month.
My back pocket.
Pass me the purse from my
back pocket!
How much do I owe you?
Today's the 15th, so half a
month has passed.
That means 350 F.
Keep the rest and for the 
reference, see Madame.
No need, I'll have 4 servants.
Your problems are far from over!
Once we are settled in 
our summer residence...
...I hope you visit us and 
spend the weekend.
You will always...
...be welcome.
Goodbye, dear friend.
Goodbye Mrs. Baroness.
Give my best regards...
...to Mrs. Barnier.
There we are, we have 
seen everything!
I would like to...
...talk to you about 
my daughter.
Doesn't she feel well?
Yes, very good.
She would like to...
get married.
- Who with?
- With you.
- That can't be true!
- Yes.
- With me?
- Yes!
You wouldn't happen...
...to like children?
It gives you nightmares?
That's great start!
So you don't like them?
Yes? No?
Now what, yes or no?
You wouldn't like to have some?
Now what?
You can't?
How's that?
You had mumps when you were 18!
Now what?
Well, that's true.
Don't you regret you can't 
become a father?
Maybe we will be able 
to arrange that.
What's up? Colette 
broke up with Mr. Martin?
Germaine!
For heaven's sake, 
keep out of this!
Let me handle this myself!
Hello, Mrs. Barnier!
What virility!
Bertrand?
Here! Come over here!
Oh, yes!
No, no, there!
Is he the young man...
...Colette wants to marry?
- Yes.
- He's not bad.
You haven't seen everything yet!
- Get undressed!
- Me?
Certainly not my wife!
Completely?
No, only the shirt.
Of course, he's not bad.
Turn around a little.
Set the works in motion...
...so we can see.
Set in motion.
- You're a masseur?
- Physical therapist.
Even better.
And you want to marry...
...my daughter?
I will get some champagne
to celebrate.
Oh, Bertrand!
Did you explain the whole 
situation to him?
I was about to, when you 
interrupted me!
Don't tell him wild stories!
Ha, ha!
Saint Philip!
Saint Philip!
Philippe.
How do you like my daughter?
Well...
She should work on her
dorsal muscles.
Are you prepared...
- ...to help her with that?
- I would be happy to.
Yes, but...
I mean in a legal way.
- Don't you understand?
- Not too well, Mr. Barnier.
- In marriage!
- Oh!
She will get a nice dowry...
...that will certainly 
improve your situation.
Oh really?
Don't you have some project
you would like to carry out?
A little project.
You must have one!
I would like to open my 
own little gymnasium.
You will be able to 
have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7!
You could even own...
...a small stadium!
- No!
A stadium! Enormous!
Come, you see that over there?
Look, look, look.
In there is all...
...you need for happiness!
You don't believe me?
Open it, you will see.
Open it.
A stadium!
A stadium. Open it.
Open it!
What's that?
- That's a bra.
- The maid has taken...
...my suitcase with her 
to the baron!
- What baron?
- My daughter's former fianc√©.
- She is engaged to a baron?
- No, she preferred Oscar.
Oscar, my former driver.
>From whom she expects a baby,
and who left to the north pole.
Another employee has stolen 
60 millions from me...
...to marry my daughter,
who is not my daughter.
And now the maid has left
with the jewels!
So you see, why I wanted 
you to marry her!
What's wrong with him?
Bernadette!
Oscar!
Oscar!
No, it's nothing!
Go on!
It's nothing, it's nothing.
Oscar!
Mr. Barnier!
I'm so happy to see you again!
- How are you?
- Fine, Mr. Barnier.
Call me Bertrand.
Tell us, what happend to you?
- When Mr. fired me...
- But it was just a joke.
Of course, just a joke!
So you left to go to the...
- ...north pole?
- Yes.
When it was time to get 
on the ship, I couldn't.
My Oscar!
Aaah! Brute!
How beautiful love is!
You are not Oscar!
- Where is Oscar?
- He has taken...
...the maid's diamonds...
...who has gone to the north pole...
...because she is expecting a 
child in a suitcase.
What are you saying?
And here are your 60 millions!
That physical therapist 
is a paranoid.
Oh, Bernadette!
Sorry. Mrs. Baroness.
Miss!
- What's wrong?
- Oscar has returned.
- Then everything is fine!
- But he left again!
- He will return!
- But then he will leave again.
But he will come back.
- Never give up hope.
- Look at me for example.
Yes of course.
Thank you, Bernadette.
I just came to return 
your father's suitcase.
Yours is here.
I couldn't open it, so 
I knew it wasn't mine.
You're lucky.
One day, you will leave 
from here, too.
Dear baron...
...when she left, Bernadette...
...took the wrong suitcase.
She has left...
...hers and taken mine.
Could you have your 
driver return it to me?
He could then take back 
the suitcase of Bern...
...of Mrs. Baroness.
You'll send your driver?
Thank you, dear baron.
That's it.
Well, those export things?
All sorted out?
Impossible to take care of that.
I'm desperate and you are 
responsible for that.
Me?
- Why?
- Jacqueline has disappered.
You will find her.
How?
I thaught she was your daughter.
- I know neither name nor address.
- That's true, but don't worry!
- Could you do me a favour?
- What?
Could you give me the suitcase?
- With the jewels?
- Yes please.
- I had so much trouble.
- Find something else for comfort.
One other thing...
What?
I stole 60 millions from you.
I know, you told me already.
I stole 60 more millions.
That can't be true!
When I say stolen, 
I mean really stolen.
Cash, from the register,
at the bank.
What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait, I'll explain first.
How did you manage to do that?
- I let you sign some papers earlier.
- Yes.
Among those I put a blank 
sheet where you wrote:
- "Read and accepted."
- Yes!
I completed that paper to 
give me full powers.
What are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
I have a transaction...
...to propose.
Yes?
You give me back those jewels 
that really belong to me.
And I give back the millions
that don't belong to me.
I accept your offer.
Bring me the money.
Then I will give you the jewels.
- What about Jacqueline?
- I'll tell you her address.
- You know it!
- She told me.
It's a deal!
- Can I have my little paper back?
- Since you're asking so nicely.
In my car, I have a suitcase...
...with 60 millions in cash.
I'll fetch it and then 
we can exchange.
He's good, but I'm better!
I will give him 
Bernadette's suitcase.
In a moment the driver will 
bring the one with the jewels.
I don't know Jacqueline's 
address...
...so I just make up one.
Here you are, Mr. Barnier.
- The address?
- Right.
- Here you are.
- 35, rue des Filles du Calvaire.
And my little paper?
- All that's left are the jewels.
- The jewels!
What's that?
Thanks, you are an honest man.
And you will find Jacqueline.
Hurry up, you must be 
dying to meet her.
What a pity you won't be 
my father-in-law.
Oh! Hurry up!
My regards to Mrs. Barnier.
See you soon.
How glad I am I could show
that swindler one more time!
Bertrand!
I called the job center 
for a new maid and they...
...sent one right away. I have
to take care of everything here.
What's the matter now!
It's because of Oscar.
We have to find him.
- Impossible!
- You fired the maid, so...
...Oscar went to the north pole.
- What's that?
- Anyway it's your fault!
I give up. See you later.
I'll see you later!
We will find your Oscar, 
my dear...
...we will find him.
I don't want to see him again.
Oh you don't? Why?
To run away just because dad's...
...masseur showed some muscles!
I bring Mr. Barnier's suitcase...
...Baron de la Butini√®re sent me.
Thank you. Very kind.
The baron asked me to return 
Miss Bernadette's suitcase.
Yes, certainly.
Thank the baron on behalf 
of my husband.
Certainly.
Goodbye.
Your father will be happy.
All that seems very strange.
Since we don't have a 
maid anymore...
...there are more people 
here than ever!
My dear Philippe!
How happy I am to see you again.
I came to say I'm sorry 
for what happened.
That's no problem.
It was all a misunderstanding.
Nothing serious.
This is my daughter.
Oh, how stupid of me!
Colette, tell your father.
I had a bit too much to drink.
When I saw Miss in the arms
of that man, I snapped.
That's just natural. 
Don't worry about that.
That was just a cousin 
returning from the north pole.
Oh really?
I imagined...
...something else.
I am very impulsive.
Dear Philippe,
thanks for coming.
I came to say I'm sorry.
That's no problem.
It was all a misunderstanding.
Nothing serious.
I told him all that already.
Find something else.
I warned you, I shouldn't drink.
You did?
It's bad for my nerves.
It turns me crazy.
Crazy?
Crazy!
- Oh! Crazy!
- Not you?
Let's talk about something else...
...about your marriage to my...
- ...daughter, if you like her.
- Oh well!
I told your wife, when I 
saw your daughter...
...in the arms of your cousin...
But I have no cousin!
The one from the north pole.
Oh! My driver!
Don't worry, I have fired him.
- I don't understand.
- There's nothing to understand!
Your proposals all seem to me...
...a little incoherent.
Don't tell me about incoherent!
Well, OK, I won't say another word.
That's it,
don't say another word!
Sit down over there.
Let's continue the conversation 
we started earlier.
I told you about a nice dowry 
for my daughter...
...which would allow you
to buy a very nice gym.
That dowry consisted of jewels...
...which I put in a suitcase.
Then I fired my maid, 
who accidentally...
...left with the wrong suitcase.
She took the one with the jewels...
...and left hers.
Do you understand?
Yes, I see.
If you don't understand 
something, tell me at once.
No, Mr. Barnier,
it's OK so far.
OK?
- OK.
- Good.
And that explains why 
when you opened it...
...you found...?
Bernadette's bra!
- That's the maid?
- Who I fired.
Who left with the suitcase?
Which contained the jewels!
- That's it.
- Is that all clear?
Absolutely.
I'll continue.
One of my employees stole 
60 millions from me.
No!
Why do you say no?
Shut up!
I simplify it, because...
He returned the money.
Even better.
Stop interrupting me!
In short. The money is 
in that suitcase.
The maid's suitcase?
No. The money is in that suitcase.
The maid's suitcase.
No! 
Try to understand!
You are like this!
I asked the baron to have 
the suitcase brought back.
What baron?
Listen, one more time:
My maid has married a baron!
Don't you understand anything?
Yes, but it's all a 
bit complicated.
It looks complicated!
But it's all very simple.
In front of you there is a 
suitcase that contains...
...60 millions in banknotes.
But you told me about jewels?
You have already enough 
to worry about!
Don't make it even more complicated!
60 millions in that suitcase.
Marry my daughter...
...and that belongs to you.
Go on!
Go! Clac!
You don't believe me.
Open it, and you'll see
I'm not crazy.
Open!
Go!
I'm crazy!
Crazy!
Crazy!
I'm crazy!
What's going on?
He's crazy!
What's going on?
I think Mr. Barnier is 
out of order.
Call the repair service.
He made strange proposals 
about a suitcase...
...full of jewels, a suitcase
full of cash.
...about an employee 
who stole 60 millions.
...and a maid who 
married a baron.
The maid marrying a baron, 
that's true. It's ours.
Maybe you misunderstood 
about the rest.
The most important is that you 
get along with my daughter.
I'll leave you two alone.
Be good.
Did dad tell you 
I was expecting a child?
You are expecting a child?
Not really.
So why would he tell me that?
I let him believe it, so 
that I could marry Oscar.
- You want to marry Oscar?
- Not any more. He leaves all the time.
What would you do in my place?
Me, Miss?
I'm tired of living with my parents.
I want to get married!
- Do you understand?
- Yes, very well.
You know that I get a large dowry?
In a suitcase!
In a suitcase?
Are you crazy?
- Germaine!
- I'm here.
There is a mystery I have to solve.
Here I had a suitcase 
which was very important.
That contained 60 millions 
in jewels?
My husband is not joking!
Silence!
- Dad!
- Shut up!
Bernadette returned your suitcase.
When?
A while ago.
You were in your office.
She picked up her suitcase.
What's the matter? 
Everything is all right!
Not at all!
That's the suitcase I gave
to Mr. Martin!
If you want to keep it, why 
did you give it to him?
You could have told me, 
you idiot!
Good, now you have all 
the explanations.
We're not finished yet!
Mr. Martin brought 
another suitcase.
Which contained 
60 millions in cash?
- Stop please!
- Silence!
Where is it?
Didn't you ask the baron 
to have it picked up...
- ...by his driver?
- Has he come?
Ten minutes ago.
Call Dr. Poussin at once!
60 millions in jewels and...
...60 millions in cash 
disappeared!
That's all your fault!
Look at her stupid face!
You're going crazy!
Yes, I'm going crazy!
That's true!
No dowry! Nothing!
Look.
I'm going crazy.
You won't get anything,
nothing at all!
Like this!
Hello doctor? Ah, baron?
Is Bernadette there?
This is Barnier calling.
She left again?
Why that?
Yes, it is my business.
What suitcase did she have?
I don't care!
You are another one!
Cretin! Idiot!
Pimpleface!
Like this!
Pimpleface!
Why are you looking 
at me like that?
Come on, let's go.
Your father has to be...
...alone for a little while.
- I'd better leave.
- No, stay for lunch.
Colette, keep your 
fiance company.
Bertrand, your conduct
leaves much to be desired.
What will your masseur...
...think of you?
Dear God, let that 
be my suitcase!
Monsieur!
It's that young girl again...
She's gone.
- She is here.
- Oh yes.
She didn't move.
Off you go!
- What?
- I am desperate.
We all are,
like this!
I can't find Christian.
I think he will return here...
- ...in just a moment.
- It that right?
It's a story about a suitcase.
I don't tell it anymore, because 
everyone thinks I'm crazy.
- Crazy?
- Crazy!
I know, nothing I say 
makes sense.
Listen, I will once again 
use you as a hostage.
You will hide here.
My suitcase!
Charles!
Let that be my suitcase!
Something terrible 
happened to me!
- What?
- Nothing at all!
Over here. It's nothing!
- Mr. Barnier.
- Yes.
- Jacqueline.
- I know. You didn't find her.
- Yes I did.
- Where?
The address you gave me is 
a house with girls.
I'll be damned!
- Yes.
- What a coincidence!
- You wouldn't have supected it?
- No.
I asked the boss, 
an awful woman...
...about Jacqueline. She 
immediately started talking...
- ...about the price.
- Oh! Was it reasonable?
Now I understand why she 
didn't tell her real name.
Now my life is meaningless.
I bring back the jewels, I'm 
no longer interested in them.
My dear Christian.
I will turn around.
You open the suitcase.
If there are jewels inside...
...clap your hands twice,
like this.
If it's still Bernadette's
you say nothing.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
I turn around, you open it.
Go ahead!
At last! I won't let go 
of it anymore!
Oh, thank you!
To thank you for that, 
I will tell you the truth.
Earlier, I have invented 
that address.
Jacqueline never was there,
she is a highly 
respectable girl.
- Really?
- She is waiting for you...
- ...in my office.
- Is that true?
I'll never forget!
Coming!
The job center sent me.
What is it?
She's from the job center.
Oh yes!
- The job center!
- That's not so bad.
Have you been told 
something about the job?
Yes.
- Do you have references?
- Of course.
- The first one is 24 years old.
- 24 years?
I felt strange when they 
gave me this address.
How's that?
- First I didn't want to come.
- Why?
Read this.
"I, the undersigned...
"...Mrs. Eug√®ne Barnier"
- That's my mother!
- Yes.
Charlotte!
Yes. I served your parents.
- What do you know!
- Time passes.
- You were a young man.
- I was...
22 years. You were still 
living with your parents.
How glad I am to see you again!
Me too.
- Now I remember!
- I was young.
What have you been 
doing since then?
I worked in different households.
- Married?
- No, but I have a daughter.
Great. How old is she?
She's about to get married.
That's marvellous!
I'm a bit embarrassed because
I can't give her a dowry.
Now that we met again, 
please allow me...
...to give her a small 
wedding present.
You are a very kind man.
How is the fiance?
A nice boy, and he has 
a fine position.
You must be happy!
Just imagine: he earns 
6000 F a month.
He's the sales manager of a 
very large company.
Christian Martin,
by any chance?
- Do you know him?
- I know nobody else.
All day long.
But then you are...
- ...Jacqueline's mother.
- You know her, too?
She's my daughter!
You know?
What?
You knew that Jacqueline
is your daughter?
- You look surprised.
- I have good reason!
Why do you tell me only today?
I never dared.
- Charlotte!
- Mr. Bertrand!
Who is that lady?
That's our new maid.
Is she sad?
No, madam. I'm crying from joy.
Me too.
Are you so happy 
to work for us?
Oh yes, madam.
- Are you so happy about it?
- Yes.
Then we will have a happy 
time in this house!
- She is here.
- Who?
Our child.
- Jacqueline?
- Yes!
Jacqueline!
She's so cute!
Mum!
What are you doing here?
Jacqueline!
- I introduce your father.
- My father?
I always told you 
you were an orphan.
You must know the truth.
Mr. Barnier is your father.
- The real one?
- The one and only!
Mum!
Let me embrace you!
- Mr. Christian Martin?
- Yes.
- Come into my arms!
- Oh, dad!
So everyone is happy here.
Madam, allow me to 
introduce myself.
No! Later!
Oscar!
I couldn't leave.
My Oscar!
May I become you son-in-law?
Agreed!
Oh no!
Agreed!
- Come on, Bertrand!
- Agreed!
Maybe I am going crazy.
Give me my suitcase.
It's yours my son.
My suitcase!
What's in there
is all you need...
...for happiness.
Bernadette!
