Alexander Popov...
...Nikolai Cherenko.
-Hi. I'm looking for Nikolai Cherenko.
-Hi.
Nick? Sure. Nick!
Hey, Nick!
Up front, they want you.
My name is John Ridley.
I'm an attorney.
My client, Mrs. Abramoff, would like
to have a word with you in private.
That's my daughter, Julia.
My husband was visiting her
when he was killed.
Then...
...she was kidnapped...
...by Russian gangsters.
I believe she's been taken
to St. Petersburg.
I need you...
...to bring her back to me.
-Was there a ransom?
-Five million.
Pay it.
That's what I said.
I think we're all aware of the fact
that if we pay, they'll kill her.
Mr. Cherenko, we're willing
to offer you $500,000.
Two-fifty now, the other half
when she's returned to us.
I'm a mechanic. I fix cars.
Nikolai Cherenko.
Born in Kiev.
Spetsnaz...
...Russian special forces.
Afghanistan.
Moved to America
seven years ago...
...illegally.
Now you fix cars.
Hope you find her.
It would be a shame if the American
authorities found out about you.
Mr. Cherenko.
I lost my husband.
I don't want to lose my daughter too.
She's probably dead already.
This is the man
that has my daughter.
I know what he did to your family.
This is my music. Do you like it?
Terrific.
You're American, right?
Saw the tags on your luggage.
I'm from lsrael myself.
Russian parents.
Yeah, I thought I'd come over here
and check out the scene.
Turn right here.
-But I thought we were going to--
-Just-- Just turn right.
Vanya!
Papa!
Thanks. Hey, man, this is my CD.
If you like my music, you can buy it.
Three hundred rubles, man.
Come on. Hey.
You wanna come upstairs
for a drink?
Can't. Work.
Listen, this job I'm doing...
...when it's finished,
I've got the money.
I want you to come away with me.
Oh, we got to go.
Burton.
Don't bother to count it.
It's more than you're worth anyway.
Got to go.
Hey...
...you drink too much.
Fuck!
Oh, for chrissake.
Take whatever you want,
whoever you are, I'm going to bed.
Oh, fuck me.
You must be the mechanic.
You got my money?
Right. Well, everything's organized.
My girlfr--
This prostitute I know
told me they're....
They're holding her in some club
down in the Nevsky district.
I've got the weapons, the backup
team. We go tomorrow night.
I'd like to see the club...
...tonight.
Abramoff hired me
to locate the girl...
...and to supply the team
and the equipment.
Now, it's been a while
since I've done anything like this...
...so let's keep it
nice and professional.
We go in there, we grab the girl,
I get paid...
...and I bugger off to Aruba.
Yeah, I don't know where it is either,
but I've heard it's bloody wonderful.
So don't do anything stupid
in there, okay?
There it is.
Fuck!
She isn't here tonight, that's why
it's set up for tomorrow night.
-Okay.
-What do you think you're doing?
Do you realize they saw my face?
-Will you stop?!
-Sorry.
Really made ourselves
bloody popular.
Where are the weapons?
The weapons?
No, don't say a word.
Do you realize you just
ruined my life?
Have you heard of
the concept of karma?
What you give out, you get back?
I don't wanna be anywhere near you
when the shit comes to hit your fan...
...Iet me tell you.
Where are the fucking weapons?
Do you know what you are?
You're totally out of control.
You want weapons?
I'll show you weapons.
Will you control yourself?
This is your backup team.
This is Yuri.
-Yuri, this is--
-We know who he is.
Yeah? But did you know
he's a total lunatic?
Satisfied?
Weapons are good.
I work alone.
Listen, if you go in alone...
...after all that shite you caused
last night, you will die.
Now, you may think I care about you,
but I don't give a shit about you.
All I care about is pulling that girl out
and getting my money.
You need a team.
Okay.
I know these boys.
They're good.
I promised them half in advance.
Where's the money?
In my bag.
I'm almost afraid to ask.
Where's your bag?
I'm afraid to tell you.
In your apartment.
Oh, fuck.
Hey, is there any room in your bag
for my suit?
Get your gun.
I have one thing to say to you:
Can we get the fuck out of here?
Come on.
Hey.
I am not getting on that thing.
Okay.
My money!
We buy the amount we discussed.
If the quality is as good
as last time...
...then we'll go on.
Unless you kill us first.
You have a deal.
I have some gifts for you.
This one is mine.
Have fun.
Hello.
My name is Klaus.
I want my money. All of it.
Or the girl dies...
...Iike her father.
Okay.
My contact in the club will let Nick
and I in through the side door, here.
Exactly two minutes later,
you guys hit the front entrance, here.
We'll pull the girl out
the same way we got in.
We rendezvous
by the getaway vehicle...
...and we get the hell out of there,
all the way to the Finnish border.
Is that clear?
Is your contact reliable?
Very.
Okay.
Six men against how many?
We don't know.
We need more money.
Right. We're on for tonight.
Yeah.
When you're lying there...
...and they're touching you...
,,,find a place on the ceiling,
A clean place,
Look at it,
Make it a window to wherever
you want to go.
That's where you hide.
It's where I hide.
Men know how to kill,
Women, how to survive,
She's upstairs.
Burton, be careful.
-Wait here.
-Go.
Number seven.
Not now, love.
Pervert.
She's drugged up to her
fucking eyeballs.
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay, come on.
Come on.
She's out of it.
You make a right here.
Go straight ahead,
past that building.
The tunnel's about 200 meters
on the right.
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.
Russian army piece of shit.
Everybody out. Push.
Push.
Push.
Push. Come on. Okay, let's go.
We must do something
or he die.
He says the kid's on his way out.
Bastards.
How's he doing?
We'll see.
Sasha will know we're headed
for the border.
The kid can't travel.
We're leaving him here.
Hey, hey.
I've already lost two friends.
I'm not leaving him.
All right.
We'll put them in the car.
I think it's about 20 K.
Okay.
Julia!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
We're trying to take you home.
That's right. Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Shit. Anybody know
a good mechanic?
I knew it. Piece of Russian junk.
I need your stockings.
The other one.
Okay, let's go.
Red pepper? What's he doing,
making a sandwich?
It's an old Russian trick
to stop radiator leaks.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Couldn't stop this leak.
How is he doing, Yuri?
-He really needs a doctor.
-Okay.
Our contact's in a village
one hour from here.
There might be a doctor there.
Papa.
-Kolja.
-Misha.
So how is he?
He's lost a lot of blood.
Yeah, well, we've both seen men
lose blood before.
Misha has her
traveling papers ready.
The Finnish border's closed
till tomorrow morning.
-We stay here tonight.
-What?
Every hour we stay here just makes it
easier for them to find us.
Hey, maybe I should have
my money now.
It'll be here in the morning.
Looking better.
You hungry?
How are you feeling, Julia?
A lot better. Thank you.
You certainly look a lot better.
Mind you, the first outfit
wasn't bad, was it?
Oh, come on.
Have a bloody vodka, Nick.
No, he was the only one in
our regiment who didn't drink vodka.
You are bloody Russian, aren't you?
Well, he did get drunk once.
That was when he backed
his tank up over our captain's jeep.
It's a song about Russia...
...and why we love her so much.
Hey.
He's got no social skills
whatsoever, that guy.
I mean, what's his problem?
You don't know about him
and Sasha?
What?
Sasha killed his family.
His wife, his son, everyone.
In revenge, Nikolai killed
five of Sasha's men.
Nick shoot Sasha in the face
and left him for dead.
So that's why he's here.
We've got the girl,
Change of plans.
We can't cross
till tomorrow morning.
I have your money,
I'll be at the village
in the morning, okay?
All right, Good,
Okay.
Well, that's it, then. It's all gone.
At least tell me about the club.
How many were--?
How many were there?
-I don't know, 1 0, 1 5.
-Oh, at least.
-There must have been 20, 25.
-What are you talking about?
Anyway, yeah.
I haven't been in a firefight
like that since....
Well, maybe the last time was
New Guinea or something.
It was fierce. It was fierce.
Only problem is...
...we were-- We were meant
to go out the same way we came in.
I left my--
This friend of mine in there.
How's he doing?
We'll see.
Nobody would be hurt
if it wasn't for me.
Thank you...
...for everything you've done.
For everything that's happened.
It's okay.
Vanya!
Burton, help me!
Burton!
Oh, Burton!
Burton!
Burton!
That's Natalya.
Natalya!
Burton, help me.
-Get your fucking hands off me!
-Hey, she's-- She's already dead.
Burton!
Oh, God!
Serie's dead.
Check your weapons.
What's the plan?
Nikolai Cherenko!
Kill them all.
Yuri, sniper.
Mama--
From one old dog to another,
shut the fuck up.
I'll give you a bone later.
Die, you fucking--
Die! You fucker!
Fucking die!
Misha!
Misha! Come--
Don't kill me, please.
That's a lot of money here. Take it.
Take it.
Thank you. Thank--
Sasha.
Hey, Nick.
When I find Aruba,
I'll send you a postcard.
Fucking crazy Russian.
We gonna spend this or what?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
-Goodbye, young lady.
-Thank you so much.
