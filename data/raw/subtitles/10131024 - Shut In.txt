Lainey!
Lainey!
Coming mama!
Where have you been?
I told you I need to
see you at all times.
Do you understand me?
Yes.
Mama, I got you an apple.
It's a good one.
Come on, get inside.
I told you not to unlock this.
Didn't you hear me?
I have to pack up, and I don't
want you running around
out there all by yourself.
And stop getting apples.
We don't need 'em.
He can join
his friends in there.
Mommy, it was for you.
Eat it.
Fine.
That's not the one.
- This one?
- No.
Are you kidding me?
Okay.
I'll get the baby.
No, Lainey. I got him.
You know the rules.
Lainey?
Please move your bike.
I can't get to the refrigerator.
Mommy, can I make the bottle?
No, baby.
I'll... I'll make his bottle.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Yes, ma'am.
Mm-hm.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I'm gonna take off tonight
so the kids can sleep
most of the way.
Well, I'm mostly done.
I just need to finish
cleaning out the pantry
and pack up the rest of the car.
Everything else is clean.
[JessicYes, ma'am.
I... I did. Yes, ma'am.
Well, I already started
looking for job postings
so it won't be long before
I could start paying rent.
We really, really
appreciate the help.
Mommy?
There is
no chance of that happening.
Mommy?
Well, I'm clean since rehab,
I told you.
- Mommy?
- Hush, baby!
I'm on the phone
to Auntie Claire.
Do you want me to take a test?
Okay,
I just used my last minute,
so I will take a test
if that's what you need.
Okay, mmm.
Mommy?
Mommy, please.
Mommy?
What?! What do you need?
What do you need?
I have to pee.
Okay. Come on. Come on.
Go to the bathroom.
Let's go.
Come on.
It's L-M-N-O-P, Lainey. Okay?
Are you almost done?
No.
Well, can you hurry up, please?
As much fun as it is
to wipe your butt,
I've got other things to do.
Keep practicing those ABCs.
You almost got 'em perfect.
It's still leakin'.
Fuck!
That's a bad word.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Nana says
that's the baddest word.
Well, Nana's dead.
I'm done.
Well.
It'll be enough to get us here.
Mama?
What, baby?
Daddy's dead like Nana.
No, baby.
Daddy is not dead.
Nana said he's bad.
No, baby. No.
Daddy's not bad. Okay?
He's not bad.
He's just, he's just sick.
Just like Mama was sick.
Mommy's not bad.
But I got better
'cause I love my little monkeys
too much to stay sick.
I'm not a monkey!
I'm a girl!
No, you are
a laughing little monkey
From the Planet Monkopolis!
What's that?
The rest of our food.
We'll eat it during the trip.
I got animal crackers in here.
I don't want to leave
Nana's house.
Well, there's
no jobs around here,
and I don't have any money
for taxes or anything else.
I could sell apples for money!
The apples are rotten, Laine.
Oh, shit.
Lainey!
Lainey! Come here!
Where are my apples, Mommy?
Lainey, listen.
I need you to open the door.
Okay. You just turn
that little latch real hard.
And it's rusted a little bit,
so you need to use your muscles.
Mommy, where are my apples?
They're bad, Laine.
Please just open the door.
Did you throw them outside?
Baby,
we can pick more apples. Okay?
But Mommy needs your help.
Can you help me?
It's hard to turn.
Make sure
it's going the right way.
Are my apples sick?
They're bad, Laine.
They're not worth savin'.
Okay. Stand back.
Lainey?
Lainey, are you there?
Yes, Momma.
Unlock the front door and
go to the red box on the porch.
Open it up,
and bring me a long metal tool.
One that has kind of
a little X on the end.
A tool?
Yes.
Just bring me what you can.
The red box on the porch.
Bring me anything
from inside of it.
- Okay, baby?
- Okay.
Here you go, Momma.
Good job.
Now try to get one
just like this with an X, okay?
Okay.
Lainey?
Did you find the tool?
Someone's here.
Who's here?
Daddy.
He took the red box.
Is the front door locked
like I told you?
Daddy's leaving.
Lainey, go outside and get him.
Run!
Got yourself
locked in here again, Jess.
Why am I not surprised?
Thanks.
This is yours.
Hm. Thanks.
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
Come on.
Calm down, Jess.
Hey.
You're hanging out with Sammy?
I needed a place to stay.
You could have stayed here
if you passed a drug test.
You know that.
Hey, small fry.
You're so pretty.
How old are you?
- Lainey.
- I'm not a fry.
- I'm a girl.
- Lainey, come here.
Come here, baby.
Come on.
Let's go to the kitchen.
Just go finish your sandwich.
Okay, baby?
Hey, sweetie.
Oh, you tracked dirt
all over the floor, damn it.
Sorry.
Where's the...
Where's the little guy?
He's upstairs
takin' a nap before the trip.
I don't wanna wake him.
So, Texas, huh?
Can't afford to stay here.
Can't afford it.
Too expensive.
Your grandma
didn't leave anythin'?
Like... like money?
No, no.
Just the house.
Look, you're both high.
So you should go.
No, I think this is good for us.
I'm glad you asked me in.
This is a chance to talk.
Talk about what?
I figured out our problem, Jess.
You think
you're too good for me.
No, no, I don't. I don't.
I just got help.
You can too.
You know, we have kids.
You brought Sammy here.
You know what he did
to that little girl.
You're always paranoid
about that stuff.
It's called projection.
What did I do, Jessica?
Nothing.
I was talking to Rob.
What did I do? Say it.
I was talking to Rob, okay.
I don't know.
You said my name.
Tell me what I did.
Go ahead.
Tell me what I did.
What'd I do?
- What'd I do?
- I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to Rob.
Look, I've a lot to do, okay?
So thank you for getting me out,
and I'll call you
when we get there, okay?
Oh, she's so busy, Rob.
She's so busy.
I think you've just been
dismissed, buddy.
Yeah, I-I'm tired of getting
dismissed by you.
You know that?
I mean... I mean,
these are my kids too.
Yeah.
You haven't changed.
You're still weak and needy.
What would have happened to you
if I hadn't gotten you
out of that pantry, huh?
Out here in the boondocks,
miles from the nearest neighbor?
You're right. I'm sorry.
Hm.
She's lying.
You're a liar.
She's not sorry.
She's a liar.
She's lying.
Yeah, you just pretend
I wasn't here, Jess.
I'll tell you what,
you don't have to pretend.
I'll put things back the way
they were before I got here.
Rob! Stop!
This is you without me!
Rob! Stop! Stop!
- Come here.
- Rob, let me go.
- Rob!
- Come here.
Rob. Rob!
This is you without me.
Rob!
I'm always
saving your silly ass!
No!
Rob!
Let me out.
Rob, what are you doing?
[SammYou are learning.
Mommy, are you in there?
Lainey,
go upstairs to my bedroom
and lock the door.
It's the little button
on the door, you turn it.
Do you understand?
Why are you in there?
Just go. Now!
Go now!
Good girl.
Rob.
Please let me out.
Please.
What are you doing?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
You put a nail through my hand,
you asshole!
[RoHere's the deal, Jess.
God.
You're gonna have a lot of
time in there to think.
You've gotten
a little too full of yourself.
Rob, you're high.
You're not thinking straight.
- Rob. Rob.
- Don't do this.
Should I grab the kids? Huh?
We can bring them to my place.
Let's move.
Don't you touch my kids,
you asshole!
Rob, he's a child molester!
Lainey! Lock the door!
Turn the button!
Rob, please don't let him
touch our kids.
Please leave them. Please.
Be careful with this.
It's pharmaceutical grade.
I'll come back when you're back
to your old self.
Rob!
Don't... don't take the kids.
Please leave them.
Rob?
Lainey?
Lainey, are you there?
Mommy loves you.
Rob.
Rob!
Lainey?
Lainey?
Lainey, is that you?
Are you here?
Mommy, why are you in there?
I got stuck again.
Lainey, where's Mason?
Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
I pushed the button on the door
and sang the ABCs to him
until he falled asleep.
You did a good job, Laine.
Okay, Lainey.
Listen very carefully.
I need you
to go lock the front door.
You already know
how to unlock it.
You just turn that little
metal thing the other way.
Okay.
I turned the lock.
You're a smart girl, Laine.
Okay.
Now, what did Daddy
do to the door?
Can you tell me what you see?
Daddy messed it up.
It's broken.
I know, baby.
But what...
What did he nail over it?
All of Nana's wood.
The two-by-fours. Crap.
Um,
Okay, Lainey, listen.
My purse... no, not my purse.
My cell...
My cell phone is on the floor
in the livin' room.
I need you to go get it
and bring it here.
Mommy, please come out.
I need to call 9-1-1.
Just go get my phone.
What's 9-1-1?
Just get the phone, please.
Are you sure
you looked everywhere?
It was on the floor.
Mommy, I can't find it.
And my purse is gone too?
Are you sure?
It's not there.
Rob, you took it.
Dammit.
Mommy, come out.
I have to pee.
You need to come with me.
Lainey, listen.
It's time for Mason's bottle.
There's one in the fridge.
And he needs his
diaper changed too,
and Mommy can't help him.
Mommy, I have to pee!
Then go pee!
I can't go with you.
I'm stuck in the pantry!
I miss Nana!
I want Nana.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.
Mommy wasn't nice.
I miss Nana too.
But we have to take care
of each other now.
Okay?
Sorry, Mommy.
Please don't get mad.
Mommy, Mason pooped.
Oh, crap.
He waited till now?
Okay, Lainey, you remember
how Mommy does it?
You take the wipes
from the diaper bag.
Use those to clean him.
And then throw those away
with the diaper
and wash your hands after.
You got it?
I know what to do.
He's heavy, okay?
He's not a doll.
I know.
Mommy, I'm hungry.
I finished it.
I'm gonna need you
to feed Mason now, okay?
There's a plastic spoon
in the diaper bag.
Use that to feed the baby.
And make sure you sit him up.
Okay?
Mommy, I'm still
hungry and I'm thirsty.
You can drink water
from the sink.
Just use the cup there.
I don't like water.
I want juice.
Well, I packed up all our food
and juice box is in the car.
We need the keys
and they're in my purse.
And you shouldn't be drinking
juice all the time anyway.
It's bad for you.
I'm thirsty for juice!
Drink water!
Don't let him choke.
Sit him up.
Do you hear me?
Mommy, mommy, wake up.
It's time for bed, Laine.
No, no.
Please come out. I'm scared.
I can't get out, baby.
You know that.
Or else I'd come tuck you in.
You can get out.
You just need to try harder.
I'm tryin' my best.
A monster's gonna grab me.
There's no monsters, Laine.
It's in the dark.
Mason needs you.
He's all alone.
I wanna stay here with you.
It's cold down here.
The heat's on upstairs.
Just shove a towel under
the window where it won't shut.
- And put on socks.
- I'm not cold.
It's just for one night.
I'll be out tomorrow.
Daddy will come back.
Daddy's bad.
Just go to bed, baby.
Okay?
Go on.
All done.
Good girl.
Okay, time to feed Mason.
Be careful, okay?
Here you go.
Dammit.
Lainey?
Yes, Momma.
When the baby falls asleep,
I need your help!
Okay.
Here you go.
That won't work, Laine.
I need somethin' metal.
A tool, so I can chip away
at the wood.
It's a strong stick.
Keep lookin'.
[And crayon thuds]
Mommy can't break through a wall
with a green crayon, Laine.
You know that.
I need somethin' hard.
I need somethin' metal.
I told you that already!
I'm sorry, Lainey.
I'm sorry for yellin' at you.
You're doing the best job.
You really are.
I'm a bad mom, okay?
I just didn't know how to do it.
I never learned.
And you don't know this,
but I was just too young
when you came around
and I wasn't ready for all this.
And then, I left you
alone for so long
when I was sick.
I messed up real bad.
But I'm tryin'.
Just promise me
that you're not gonna grow up
and hate me like I hated my mom.
Lainey?
Lainey, are you here?
Laine?
Who's here, Laine?
Answer me.
I found it under the leaves.
It's Daddy's tool.
He lost it.
Good job, baby.
You did it.
This is exactly what I needed.
I did it.
You are a good girl, Laine.
I love you.
I'm gonna go take care of Mason.
I'm gonna get out of here.
Just sit tight!
Lainey, you there?
I'm almost done.
Maybe a few more hours
I can crawl out under the house.
What's going on up there?
Mason!
Lainey, what happened?
I dropped the baby.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
He was trying to
crawl down the stairs.
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Mommy, I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
You need to pick him up and
hold him until he stops cryin'.
He's alone
and he's scared right now.
He wants milk but it's all gone.
You need to make him a bottle.
You remember how Mommy does it.
It's three scoops of formula,
the powder in the can.
You fill it up with water,
put the nipple on tight,
and shake it.
Okay.
You can do it.
Lainey,
almost there.
I can do this.
It's gonna be fine.
Laine?
Mommy, someone's here.
Who's here?
Is it Daddy?
It's that man
he called me a fry.
Okay.
Lainey, please tell me
you locked the front door.
He's coming in.
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Lainey,
run upstairs to the bedroom
and lock the door.
Maybe that man can get you out.
He's bad, Laine. Run!
Hello?
Anybody home?
Little girl?
[SammJessica?
Where's Rob?
Is he with you?
Rob is busy.
So I thought I'd come
and babysit for you.
We don't need a babysitter.
I'm fine.
Oh.
Please leave my house.
You really
like to dismiss people,
don't you, Jessica?
You know.
Your daughter.
She's very pretty.
Very pretty.
Where is she?
She upstairs?
Rob's gonna be pretty pissed at
you if you mess with his kids.
I thought I saw
her go upstairs, Jessica.
- Is that where she is?
- Stay away from them.
Rob owes me money.
And I'm here to collect payment,
Jessica.
No, no, stop!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.
Little girl?
Little girl?
Where are you?
Where are you, little girl?
I have Rob's meth!
It's yours.
I haven't used it.
I got probably
three grams down here.
Come on.
Don't let it go to waste.
Rob's just gonna take it back.
He gave you three grams
and he owes me money?
Yeah. And it's
all yours if you want it.
It's all yours.
Okay.
Send it under the door.
- Go ahead.
- Let me out.
And it's all yours.
Let you out?
No can do, Jessica. No.
I don't get involved
in domestic disputes.
Well, call the police.
Or let me
use your phone, please.
Not calling the police.
Not getting you out.
Send it under the door, Jessica.
If I give you the meth,
will you leave us alone?
You have to leave the house,
and you can't come back.
Of course, Jessica.
I'll go. I'll leave.
You have my word.
Put it under the door.
[SammJessica?
Push it under the door, Jessica.
Jessica?
- Sorry. Sorry.
I just... I'm injured.
I'm... I'm too weak
to get close enough.
Reach under the door
and I'll drop it in your hand.
You sound fine to me, Jessica.
Just push it under the door.
I can't reach that far.
Push it under the door, Jessica.
I-I'm stuck... I'm stuck
over here on the other end.
I can't move much.
Have you tried it yet?
Rob said it's good stuff.
If you can't decide,
I'm gonna dump it out.
Hey, hey. Hold on.
Okay.
Where is it?
Can you reach my hand?
Almost.
Just... just can you stretch out
a little bit more?
Okay.
That's as far as I can go.
Can you reach my hand?
I can just reach you.
Okay, drop it in my hand.
Here it comes.
Take it out!
Take it out!
What did you do?
Take it out!
Take it out, you bitch!
What did you do to me?
Get it out of my hand.
I swear. I'm getting out...
You'll get out when I get out.
Keep your other hand out of here
or I will cut it off!
I'm gonna gut your kids
in front of you. you whore.
Get it out of my hand.
Get it out of my hand,
you bitch!
Get it out!
What did you do?
Get it out.
Get it out!
Get it out now!
Oh, please.
Please, okay.
Get it out now!
Get it out! Get it out!
What are you doing in there?
It smells like liquor.
Wow.
All liquored up.
You little bitch.
Take it out!
Jessica, please.
It's cold.
I'm freezing.
There's a storm coming in.
I saw it on the news.
It's gonna be freezing.
Please.
I get cold... I get cold easy.
I don't like the cold.
Please.
- You left my front door open.
I hope you freeze to death.
What?
What did you say?
You hope I freeze to death?
Oh, you hope I freeze to death.
I hope you freeze to death.
I hope you freeze to death.
Hope? You hope I freeze to
death? You're an idiot.
People who use hope
are desperate, Jessica.
They're desperate people,
weak people.
Shut up.
I heard you went through rehab,
Jessica.
Oh yeah, Rob told me,
he told me all about it.
Oh yeah, Jessica,
she went through rehab.
Did they teach you
hope in rehab?
That's what they taught you?
They taught you to hope?
Right after they took
all of your money.
Oh yeah. I know that routine,
Jessica.
I went through rehab.
Oh, yeah.
I was clean and sober
for a long time, Jessica.
I got a job.
I took college courses.
I even filed a tax return.
And then after my mother died.
I realized that no one
in the whole world
gave a shit about me anymore.
That's what they didn't
teach me in rehab.
They didn't tell me
when I got sober
that I would go back
to the same miserable life
I used drugs to get away from.
Jessica?
You still got the three grams
in there with you?
Yes.
You ain't
gonna last long, Jessica.
Stop talking to me.
- You know it. I know it.
- Stop talking to me.
You know something?
I can smell weakness from here.
I can smell it.
The stink of weakness.
You and I.
We understand.
I don't molest little girls.
I hate you,
and I hate everyone like you.
How many people do you know
like me, Jessica?
Did somebody touch you,
when you were a little girl?
Put their hands on you, Jessica,
when you were a little girl.
Stop talking to me.
Stop talking to me.
Stop talking to me.
I said stop talking!
Please, Jessica.
Please.
I'm freezing here.
I'm cold. I'm cold.
What are you doing, Jessica?
I'm getting out.
You're gonna scratch your way
out like a little mouse?
You know, what? I wasn't gonna
hurt you or your kids.
Yeah, right.
I like kids.
I'm not a bad guy.
You're a monster.
Oh.
Dammit.
Power's out, you dumb bitch.
- Lainey?
- Mommy?
Lainey? Lainey!
Lainey, stay upstairs.
Do not come down here.
Mama?
Lainey, Lainey, go back.
Go back upstairs.
Do not come down here.
Mommy, are you in there?
Lainey?
Lainey, run!
Run away!
Lain...
I got her. I got her.
Don't hurt her!
Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!
- Take it out! Take it out!
Take it out now! Take it out!
I'll pull it out.
I'll pull it out!
I'll pull it out!
Don't hurt her!
- Mommy, he got me!
- Pull it out!
Pull it out!
Hold on! I need to
find a way to get it out!
Mommy, help me!
Okay. Okay.
Hold on. I can't see.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I've got your daughter.
Pull it out, now.
Pull it out, now.
Pull it out!
Run, Lainey! Run!
Get away from him!
Aah!
What did you do?
Lainey, run!
Lainey!
- Put it out. Put it out! Now!
Put it out! Ah!
Put it out!
Put it out!
Put it out, please.
Please. Please. Please. Please.
Jessica.
Put it out!
Put it out!
Lainey?
Let me know you're okay.
Put a blanket on the baby.
What the.
Watch out for false prophets.
They come to you
in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly
they are ferocious wolves.
By their fruit,
you will recognize them.
Do people pick grapes from
thorn bushes
or figs from thistles?
Likewise, every good tree
bears good fruit,
but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear
bad fruit,
and a bad tree
cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree
that does not bear good fruit
is cut down
and thrown into the fire.
Thus by their fruit
you will recognize them.
Nana.
What good is this to me now?
Sammy?
You alive? Sammy?
Lainey?
Lainey?
Mason, I'm coming.
Lainey, I'm out of
the pantry now.
Come let me in!
Mommy, Mommy.
Oh, Mama's here.
I'm gonna look at you.
Let me look at you.
Mama's here, Mason.
Come here, Mason. Mommy's here.
Hello, Mason.
You did a good job.
You did such a good job, baby.
Thank you. Thank you.
You did so good.
Mama, I'm hungry.
Can I have animal crackers now?
They're in the car, remember?
You gotta hold Mason, okay?
Good girl, good girl.
Thank you. Keep him warm.
Thank you.
Mommy, I'm hungry.
Momma, I want to go back inside.
Come on. Come here.
Come here.
I'm cold.
Hold your brother.
Hold him tight, baby.
Hold your brother, hold him.
Come on. Come on. Let's go.
The animal crackers.
Leave it. Leave it. Leave it.
Come on, Lainey. Let's go.
The storm's getting dangerous.
Come on. Let's go. Come on.
Can I have animal crackers now?
Okay.
Let me go get them.
Okay, here.
You take Mason, okay?
You got him?
Hold him tight.
Keep him warm, baby.
Okay.
Lainey?
Lainey, let me in!
Lainey?
Lainey!
Lainey!
Lainey!
Lainey!
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down!
No, no, no, no!
Let them go.
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
Mommy's here!
Let them go, please.
Please, please, please, please.
Please let them go!
I said please twelve times,
Jessica!
Remember? Please, please!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please, please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Let them go!
- You want... you want Mommy?
You want Mommy?
Mommy, I wanna go.
- Ssshh. Just sit tight.
- Look what you did to my hand!
Stop!
Stand there! Don't move!
Don't move!
The meth is still in
the pantry downstairs.
You can have it, okay?
You can have it.
Just go take it.
Yeah?
There's money in there too.
There's money,
there's like thousands,
there's a lot of money
from my grandmother.
You can have it, okay?
- Yeah? There's money in there?
Just. just give me the baby.
I'm gonna cut your babies.
Stop! Stop!
Let them go.
- Don't cry. Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.
Please just... please stop!
Please let them go.
Don't move.
- Let them go!
- Move again, and I'll cut him.
I'll cut him. I...
- Drop the knife, Sammy.
Drop the knife!
What the hell are you
doing here with my kids?
That bitch.
Put a screwdriver
through my hand.
- I don't want to hear it now.
- Look at it.
- Look what she did to me!
- Drop the knife!
She put a screwdriver
through my hand.
Drop the knife, man.
- Drop it.
- You owe me money, Rob.
You owe me money.
Drop the knife! On the floor!
- Drop the knife.
- All right.
- It's down. It's down.
- Drop the knife!
It's down. It's down.
It's down.
Let go of my kid.
That's good. That's good.
Don't worry, baby.
Just go with mom.
Go with mom.
You didn't answer my question.
Look what she did to my hand.
What are you doing here
with my kids?
What are you,
some kind of pedophile?
You owe me money!
What is that?
A tree branch fell, baby.
Jessica,
where ya running off to?
Thank you for coming back.
I just want to
get the kids out of here.
Hey, here.
Um, I just need my car keys.
The kids are safe.
Sammy won't hurt them now.
I... I took care of it.
- Come on.
- So.
What's this
about your Nana's money?
Who oh!
I think that was easier
to put up than take down.
I need to
get the kids to the doctor.
Why?
They look fine to me.
All right?
Don't be
such a helicopter parent.
They're hungry.
We need to eat.
It's freezing
and my hand is infected
Yeah, all right.
Looks like you had
a little fun in here.
I didn't.
I'm still clean.
Holy shit.
You weren't lying.
Holy shit balls!
Do you know what this'll buy us?
You can take it, okay?
Just have all of it.
Just go and leave us alone.
You never shot it?
Wanna try?
Come on. We'll do it together.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.
There's food out in the car.
I want to feed the kids first.
We should eat something too.
It's important to eat, or you'll
get sick. You know that.
Yeah, yeah.
All... all right.
Yeah, let's eat first.
I'll get the food.
You stay here.
Can I have some?
No, baby, this is for Daddy.
He's bringing our food
in from the car.
Daddy's bad.
Yeah.
He is.
Jess, you ready?
I got some better stuff here.
I just picked it up
on my way over.
Better than what you gave me?
You said it was pharma grade.
Yeah. I was wrong.
That shit's cut heavy.
I took one hit
and lost it pretty bad.
That's what I got here so late.
Wasn't my fault.
I'm glad you didn't take it.
I'm stickin' to
crystals from now on.
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about it.
You need to eat first.
You saw the way Sammy was.
Just wasted away.
You have to make yourself eat,
even when
you don't feel like it.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Mm.
That's good.
What is this crap?
Looks like
literal crap, you know?
It's my nana's apple butter.
Mm.
Eat up.
Can we do that
in the living room, please?
I don't want the kids to see.
Yeah, sure.
Your turn.
Here.
I'm not ready yet.
I'll do it later.
No way.
Come on.
We're doing this together.
Hurry up.
I got one more
hit in this needle.
Well, I want a clean needle.
Tie yourself off.
This is for your own good.
Hey, hey.
I don't want to hurt you, Jess.
I never did.
Come on.
My hand is hurt.
You bitch!
Get up and tie yourself off,
or I'll shoot you in the fish.
That's right.
Come on.
Go ahead and kill me.
Tie yourself off.
Hey, hey.
Where you going, Jess?
Jess?
Where are you going, Jess?
Where are you going, Jess?
Get back here.
Jess!
Why are you running
away from me? Hm?
I'm gonna stick this
needle in your arm.
I'm doing it, all right?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You go to rehab one time,
you think you're better
than everyone
and you cut me out
like I'm nothing.
Like I said,
the only problem between us
is you think that
you're better than me.
But you're not.
All right? We're the same.
We're the same.
Goddammit.
You're OD'ing.
What'd you give me, Jess?
I gave you three grams
of your shitty cut meth.
The stuff that you
locked me up with
while my babies were cold
and alone and in danger,
and I was rotting away
in a fucking pantry!
You're nothing.
I'm not nothing.
I'll break you, Jess.
Ooh.
Oh really? Oh, really?
Easy boy.
Mommy, I got you a apple.
- It was hiding.
- You did?
Well, let's take a look at it.
Come here.
Okay.
I got some good news.
The cafe in town ordered 20 jars
of Nana's Apple Butter.
They're gonna put it
on their pecan waffles.
Isn't that cool?
Is it good? Is it good?
Huh?
Is the apple good?
Well, it's just one
little brown spot here.
We'll cut it out.
Use the good parts, remember?
Okay, baby,
let's practice your ABCs, okay?
Ready?
Now I know my ABCs.
Next time,
won't you sing with me?
