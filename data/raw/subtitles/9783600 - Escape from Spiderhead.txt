you are an incarcerated volunteer
in the Spider head clinical trial program.
Before we begin,
I need your permission to administer G-46.

Nacho cheese.

All right, Ray, Ray, these next ones

[Ray] Oh, yeah?
[continues laughing]
[clears throat]
In the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
over 800,000 people died.

You are serving…
You're serving
four consecutive life sentences
without the possibility of parole.

Another beautiful morning, friends,
time to rise and really shine.
As volunteers in the Spider head
Penitentiary and Research Center…
[device whirring]
…you must do your part
and practice the golden rules,
no abuse, physical, verbal, or otherwise
and label your food in the fridge.
Jeff, please report to the dock
for remote field testing.
[man] Okay, Jeff, we have
a new compound for you today.
- Drip on?
- If it's N-31.
[man] Hilarious, N-40. Acknowledge?
Acknowledge.
[chimes]
Yeah, whenever you're ready, Jeff.

- Where you been?
- [Jeff] Field trip.
Oh, right, your phone call with Emma.
No, uh, drug study.
N-40, I think.
[woman] They have everyone
on these field trips but me.
You're still new.
I'm not that new.
You know, I'd love some sunshine.
Can I help you with the…
Nectarines and prosciutto?
What you gonna help with?
I'm done. You're late.
Open up.
Enjoy that. Get it all.
- [laughing] Yeah.
- It's really good.
- Good, right?
- I hope they keep you on snack.
I always said they wasted
your talents on janitorial.
Don't be too sure about that.
I've got a bit of a scrub fetish.
[laughs]
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Hey…
- Did you notice we kinda...
- Finish each other's sentences?
I was gonna say, need new bowls.
[laughs]
Uh…
So, how was the N-40?
[bird chirping]
{\an8}[Jeff] Flowers didn't grow…
They were sculpted. Painted.
I mean, I would tell you about it,
but I'm just coming down off the...
- Verbaluce.
- Yeah.

Yeah.
Well, you're cute when you're stupid.
Okay, but it sucks

Oh, how rude of me.
Jeff, Heather. Heather, Jeff.
For the record, either prior to or during
your incarceration here at Spider head,
have you two ever spoken?
- No.
- No.
Ever interacted in any way?
Did I not just say no?
[Jeff] No.
So, what do you think?
Who are you asking?
I'm asking both of you.
Let's start with Jeff.
Yeah, she seems nice.
You like that word, but no,
I mean, how attractive is she?
What, Steve,
you can't see it for yourself?
Can you shut up, please?
I'm asking Jeff. How's she looking?
[clicks tongue] Come on, man.
- [Abnesti] A scale of one to ten?
- Um…
Yeah, she's a seven and a half.
[Abnesti] And, Heather?
He's all right. A five on a good day.
- Did you give her Honest-Ease?
- [Abnesti chuckles]
No, I would have to ask. You know.
I'm just kind of a bitch.
Oh.
Well, then I would like
to change my vote to an eight.
[Abnesti] All right, uh, Jeff, Heather,
can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?
Acknowledge.
- Uh, yeah.
- [Abnesti] Heather?
[whispering] God, she's a pain in the ass.
- Acknowledge. [sighs]
- Thank you.

- [remote chimes]
- [device whirring]

[Abnesti] Come on, guys.

Okay, yeah,
she's starting to look pretty good.
[chuckling] Oh, my…
Yeah, she's…
She's looking really, really good.
[device whirring]
[device beeps]
[Abnesti] Heather?

Yeah, don't tell us, tell each other.

you're gorgeous.
{\an8}Sorry, I didn't see it before.
{\an8}It's okay, you're the most beautiful woman
I think I've ever seen in my life.
[Heather] Thank you.
Wow.
- [Heather] Yeah.
- I could, uh…
- Yeah?
- [Jeff] I could…
[exhales]
[breathing heavily]
You could what, Jeff?
[whimsical jazz music playing]
[both breathing heavily]
[Abnesti] Oh, yeah.
Are we getting this?
[breathing heavily]
- [Heather] Oh, yeah.
- [moans]

- [moaning] Oh, my God.

You okay?

Oh.
[chuckles]
[Heather, breathlessly] What's so funny?
Nothing.
[music stops]
I didn't think it was possible.
[Heather] What?
- I'm liking cuddling.
- [chuckles]
Please send me home
with some of this shit.
Heather…
Yes?
I love you.
Holy shit.
I love you too.
N-fucking-40, baby.
[laughs] Yeah, God damn, we're good.
The love drug.
Gold star?
Not yet, not yet. No, no.
We're less interested in
what we just saw than the residual effect.
I realize you're stretched thin,
but I need you to observe these two.
After they come down, in the next hours,
days, do they seek contact?
Profess feelings when
they're in the same room?
Do they communicate non-verbally?
Look for isopraxisms.
Uh, mirrored behaviors.
People in love
unconsciously mimic each other's actions.
They scratch their faces,
fiddle with their hair at the same time.
It's like their bodies
can't help themselves.
So watch Jeff and Heather.
I want to know. I want to know, does love…
Does this love last?
[Abnesti clears throat]
Hey, guys, thank you. [chuckles]
Thank you very much, no kidding.
We couldn't do it without you.
Remember, what you're feeling,
the sometimes
disquieting transitions are natural.
We're bringing you back
to baseline. More to come.
[device beeps]
Am I back on snack?
[Lizzy laughing] You don't
wanna know, trust me.
Me and the girls at the group home,
we swiped lottery tickets
from convenience stores,
scratched them a hundred at a time.
It looked like we were doing honest work,
you know, dirt under our nails.
It's not like we thought
stealing was bad, right?
No one needed it more than us
'cause we had nothin'.
Yeah.
This one Christmas Eve,
we're drivin' through neighborhoods,
everyone's at church.
We're breaking windows,
stealing presents from
under people's Christmas trees…
Here you go.
Know what happens the next morning?
We're openin' up other people's sweaters,
The Grinch comes on TV.
[Jeff chuckles] Man.
That part where
he gives back all the presents?
- I felt so bad.
- Yeah, I bet.
I cried like a little punk-ass.

It's not.

at anything as you are with that.
- [Jeff] You like that?

Hey, is there a drug
to make you forget shit?
Yeah, it's called old age.
[chuckles]
I'm looking forward to it.
[Mark] How you feeling?
[Jeff] I'm all right. A little sore.
It must've felt pretty good
at the time though.
Yeah.
- We can get you some cream for that.
- [scoffs]
I'm fine. Thanks, though.
Hey, uh, do me a favor.
While we're at it, try not to let
the girls touch your MobiPak.
And don't… And don't touch theirs. Okay?
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,
they can flood.
You could lose control.
Cool.
Uh, hey, Mark?
Yeah?
Can you take me off snack?
Was something wrong? Problems with Lizzy?
Nah, just, I'm ready for a change.
Yeah. Okay.
Thanks, man.
[door closes]
[sighs]
[softly] God damn it.
Oh, my God.
Lizzy.
[Mark] Is she from Seattle?
Prescott, Arizona.
Ah, see? Jeff knows.
It's cool when folks get acquainted.
Speaking of,
I saw the box scores this morning.
You Mariners are on a bit of a streak.
We should pipe in a game later, huh?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Who're they playing?
Crap. Hey, Mark, return this.
Uh, Jeff, please take a seat.
Another full day ahead.
If you could read the headlines,
you can't, but if you could,
the world needs our help more than ever.
Now, we got two rooms running today.
Pay no attention to Dave, trust me.
Seriously, trust him.
[Abnesti chuckles]
Jeff…
All right. Recognize them?
That's very funny.
I'm gonna present you with a choice.
This is what I'm after.
- Mm-hmm.
- You see this remote?
Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx,
or you could slide this button
and Heather gets some Darkenfloxx.
You see? You choose.
- They have Darkenfloxx in their MobiPaks?
- [Dave belches]
Excuse me.
Hey, Dave, how you feeling?
[vomits]
Hungry.
- Could he be shit-finger?
- Yeah, maybe.
All that food's
gotta go somewhere. [chuckles]
Where were we? Darkenfloxx.
Mark put it in the ladies' MobiPaks
in anticipation of this very study.
That make you feel uncomfortable?
[Jeff] A little.
Yeah? That's okay, it should.
But you know as well as I
it's just an agitator,
causes no permanent damage. All right?
So what's your decision, Jeff?
Is Heather getting
the Darkenfloxx or is Sarah?
I don't know, I can't say.
Can't say or won't say?
You kinda have to, you know that.
I mean, it's random if I do.
You feel your decision would be random?
Yeah.
[Abnesti] This is what we're testing for…
Is any residual fondness with…
With the ladies.
So why don't you tell me
how you feel about Heather and Sarah?
How I feel?
Maybe some Verbaluce?
[laughs] No.
I mean, it's not that I like 'em both,
or that I like one more than the other.
It's just, I… I just don't really feel
anything towards either of them, you know?
I mean, I can remember feeling
a certain way towards 'em,
but that's all kind of
hazy and worn off now.
And why such reluctance
to the Darkenfloxx then?
Because I was a part of I-16.
[breathing heavily]
I mean, I know what it's like,
and you know what it's like.
- It's…
- Yeah.
It's… It's horrible.
And I just…
I don't want to do that to anyone.
Look, I don't know. It's random.
Okay. I'll tell you what.
I'm giving
the Darkenfloxx to Heather. Okay?
Actually, I'm gonna give it to Sarah.
All right, Jeff, you've convinced me.
It would to you be random,
you truly have no preference.
My preference is that nobody gets it.
That makes two of us.
Three.
See what we just did.
With your help, we learned
a lot more about N-40.
"Luvactin," working title.
So, no one's getting Darkenfloxx?
[Jeff] Not today.
But we do need
to understand N-40 a bit better.
For instance, uh,
what's the drug's duration?
What's the variable effect
of its dosage?
You and Sarah were on double the dose
of you and Heather
and yet your feelings for the two women
are largely the same.
Don't you find that interesting?
Yeah.
Hey, uh, I, uh… I'm not one to bring
Darkenfloxx in any conversation,
but we have to know more about N-40.
It could be a game-changer, Jeff.
The work we do
could help millions of people.
You ever loved?
Yeah.
Yeah, you were lucky. Not everyone can.
You know that loneliness is as lethal
as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?
Look it up.
Imagine if we could destroy
all the world's cigarettes.
We'd have people everywhere loving,
being loved, capable of love,
and who would've made that possible?
- Gold star for me.
- [Abnesti chuckles] Yeah.
Yeah. And your new friend, N-40.
Yay for us.
[dully] Yay.
[Jeff] Okay. Thank you, ladies.
[keys jingling]
Excuse you, Jeff.
Hey. Everything okay?
Yeah.
They don't know how close
they came to getting Darkenfloxxed.
Yeah, I know. I get it.
But listen, man, think if you'd had
the benefit of one of our products
before your fateful night…
What is it you want, Jeff,
more than anything in the world?
To go back.
- [tires screech]
- [car crashes]
[grunts]

[Abnesti] What you want is redemption.
And this is how you're gonna find it.
Yeah, thanks.

but I just wanted to tell you
the usual that I miss you and I'm sorry.
Something else I wanna tell you too.
I, uh, met someone.
Yeah, her name's Lizzy.
She kinda reminds me of you a little bit.
So maybe I'll finally stop bugging you.
This'll be my last, "I'm sorry."

We've all seen what it does.
It's already proven.
This isn't some type of skin show.
Tell 'em, Rogan.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
But fuck all y'all.
- [Mark] He has a future in greeting cards.
- I can fuckin' hear you!
Guys, listen, listen to me, okay?
I've never been with a… Uh…
No offense, man. If you have, that's fine.
It's not my thing. Whatever.
Look, Mark, I'm not recovered, man.
I asked for cream,
nobody brought me cream.
So I'm not doing this. I won't.
No, I'm not. No! No! No! No!
I'm not, I won't. I won't acknowledge.
[Abnesti] Jeff, chill pill. It isn't what
you think. No romance novels today.
Huh.
Your loss.
Funny.
[whimsical music playing]
[Abnesti] That's it, guys. Thanks.
What the fuck was that about?
[door closes]
[intercom chimes]
[man on PA] Ping-pong
tournament set for Saturday.
Please see Ray if you're interested.
- Oh, hi, Jeff.
- Hey, Heather.
It's not the time.
Did Mr. Abnesti ask you
who to Darkenfloxx, me or Rogan?
- He did present me with that dilemma...
- Heather.
Did you recently have sex
with Rogan in addition to me
and fall in love with him
like you did with me?
Jeff, come on.
That's an accurate assessment
of what's going on.
- Heather, put a sock in it.
- Okay.
Jeff, what are you doing?
Now she's looking for her sock.
You get very literal on Verbaluce.
Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.
Show yourself out, close the door.
- Okay.
- Well done.
Please show yourself out, thank you.
- Jesus Christ, Jeff. It's...
- Wow. Yeah.
What's going on, huh?
- So everybody's just fucking everyone?
- Language.
Everyone's fucking everyone.
- Relax.
- And being asked to Darkenfloxx everyone.
It's experimental design.
I don't make the rules,
it's the Protocol Committee.
Why don't you take a look? Look. Here.
Here you go. Huh?
{\an8}You think I want to do this?
{\an8}Let me close the door.
Mark, I mean, look, man,
I've been on
some crazy-ass project teams, right?
But this one…
Yeah, this one doesn't feel right.
[Abnesti] Jeff, you know,
I sympathize, but only to a point.
I gotta take off my friendship hat
for a second and remind you,
your presence in this facility,
while technically a punishment,
is a privilege. Is it not?
You applied for it,
you were approved for it.
You could as easily be
at State with the general pop
and you would be playing pitch-and-catch,
in your case catch,
with the likes of Rogan.
You don't wanna know
what he did in his last prison.
And secondly,
our open-door policy is my greatest pride.
I can come visit you, you can visit me.
Even in my quarters
or up here in the Spider head.
No other penal institution in the world
boasts such a respectful relationship
between the jailer and the jailed.
No bars, no guards, that's only possible
in a culture of mutual respect.
Okay? Mutual respect.
I don't burst in on you, do I?
Huh?
- No.
- [Abnesti] No.
So, you don't burst in on me.
We must honor that or it's my ass.
Doors close, locks go on,
suddenly we're no different
from anywhere else, you get it?
Yes.
Jesus, is it all that terrible here?
Huh? I'm asking
'cause I've taken great pains, Jeff.
[Jeff] It's very nice.
The food, the ping-pong, arcade games,
freedom within reason
to move around as you please.
I've insisted on that for you.
I've flirted with violating
state compliance standards,
- at no small risk to me.
- I know.
In front of my bosses, my boss' bosses.
Back me up here, Mark.
- Hmm? Come on, say something.
- He's right.
[voice breaking] At least you could
return the sentiment.
It's the least you could do.
I'm sorry.
Okay? I…
It's just, all this talk of Darkenfloxx,
it gets me on edge. Okay?
I hate this, Jeff and I'm sorry. Okay?
I just…
I need to know if we can count on you.
Can we count on you in the future
to honor our arrangement?
[whimsical music playing]
Hey, Sarah.
This time, next week, we'll have
our last gold star, don't you think?
Mark, smile once in a while, okay?
We're changing the world.
Yeah.
Not you too.
Listen, Darkenfloxx is a tool, okay?
It's gonna help us figure out
the important shit.
This time, next week,
right back in the drawer, I promise.
Yeah? What?
Well, just something Jeff said
about wanting a drug to forget.
You need to relax, okay?
Enjoy your weekend, Mark.
Hit the mainland, clear your head.
You need it. We both do.
Maybe wings, beer, Skee-Ball,
whatever you kids are into?
Yeah, um… Oh, I think Skee-Ball.
[chuckles] Okay.

Bye, Mark.

Holy fucking shit.
[ominous music playing]
[breathing heavily]
["Rise" playing]
[music continues over speakers]
[Jeff] I mean, it's hard to describe
without Verbaluce,
but just imagine
the worst you've ever felt times ten,
and even that doesn't even
come close to it, honestly, I mean…
I felt like I was on fire.
I wished I was on fire.
I would have set myself on fire
to make it stop. It's horrible.
So they give this Darkenfloxx to someone?
I mean, not this time.
Well, that's good.
Jesus, you're shaking.
You're a good guy.
Look, I heard from Mark
that you asked to be taken off snack.
I assume that meant away from me, right?
It's 'cause of, uh…
Emma?
Yeah.
No, she's…
She's moved on.
It just helps to hear her voice sometimes.
Yeah, I know.
Of course, I get it, you know.
This place can really mess with your head.
I mean, they've been testing me up
and down a lot weirder stuff than usual.
It's just been really tough lately.
Sometimes, it's hard to remember
who I was before I came in here.
But, Lizzy…
When I'm with you…
That's the only time
I really feel like myself.
Hands up, Mark. Come on.
[grunts] There you go.
- [grunting]
- So, I had a big idea for G-46.
Oh, yeah? What, Laffodil?
Yes, uh, we sell it to comedy clubs.
That's a little idea, Mark. No offense.
Offense kind of taken.
Whoo-hoo! [grunting]
[panting]
What do I keep saying to you, huh?
I don't know, "Shut up, Mark"?
I say you gotta think huge.
You look at the world through
the wrong end of binoculars.
That's weird. Don't be weird.
Hey, uh, what time do we start?
Ten minutes.
Why don't you hit me? We got time.
Come on, hit me. Let's go.
- [Mark] Two?
- [Abnesti] Uh, make it three.
Remember, at least 12 hours apart.
Yeah, I've heard the dosing schedule.
Thank you.
Say it. Come on,
you've been wanting to for a while.
Best shot.
You of all people...
Should understand the risks?
That's what I'm trying to do.
- We can assess risks without taking them.
- Oh, can I?
Someone has to answer
for our products, Mark.
Doesn't that occur to you?
Life out there is not life in here, okay?
Shit is messy.
It's out of our control.
This is new frontier stuff here.
And when, not if, when one of
our compounds falls on its face,
one of us has to stand
in front of a bereaved loved one,
or Mike Wallace, or God forbid, a jury,
and answer for what we do.
What we made and bottled
and named and sold.
Is that gonna be you?
No, it's gonna be the guy who can say,
"You're right I stand behind our shit.
I've taken it myself."
Mike Wallace is dead.
Really? Hard to keep track.
Ed Bradley then.
Also dead.
Morley Safer?
Shit. Better to think someone's dead,
and find out they're alive.
Yeah, when you first hired me...
Yeah, you disapproved. Duly noted.
Hey, Jeff, how are you?
- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to…
That's cool.
Maybe a bit of advance notice next time.
Sure.
Yeah, shall we?
Nobel Prize ain't gonna
win itself. [chuckles]
Mark?
I'm gonna freshen up,
so be down in a second.
[softly] Shit.
- Is Heather…
- On her way.
Beautiful people get away with too much.
I say that having
benefited myself from time to time.
Heather, thanks for joining us.
Be right with you.
All right, uh, Jeff,
I want to start by apologizing.
No, look,
I shouldn't have walked in on you.
Oh. No, not that. Uh…
Remember the other day when I asked you
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to
and you said neither?
Yeah.
That was good enough for me,
but apparently not the Protocol Committee.
- Mm-hmm.
- Three Horsemen of Anality.
They're not convinced
you don't have residual feelings
for Heather and Sarah.
So, unfortunately today we gotta do
a kind of a confirmation trial.
This time per
the Protocol Committee, Mark,
uh, instead of me asking you
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to,
which the Protcom felt was,
they say, "too subjective,"
we're gonna give the girl
the Darkenfloxx and then see what you say.
Once again on some Verbaluce.
You refreshed his MobiPak?
His quantities good?
They are. [softly] Plus
I already told you they are.
And what about Heather's?
You stood right there
and watched me, Steve.
That I did, Mark.
[chuckles]
Sorry, Jeff, we're a little tense today.
Not an easy day and everyone's
a little bit uncomfortable about this.
I don't want you to Darkenfloxx Heather.
Okay, good start.
Uh, is that because you love her?
Feelings of love?
No, I mean, I already told you that.
Yeah, uh, and I agreed,
but is this confirmation trial
about what you and I want?
Not so much.
What it is about
is about us recording what you say
as you observe
Heather getting Darkenfloxxed
for five minutes, that's all.
One five-minute trial. Okay?
So, here we go with the Verbaluce.
Drip on, Jeff?
Oh, come on, Jeff.
You should be flattered.
Did we choose Rogan?
You're afraid of Rogan.
Yeah, Rogan could kill you
with a box of Kleenex.
But no, we deemed your level of speaking
more commensurate with our data needs.
Drip on?
God, did you even know Heather's story?
You don't. Legally, you can't.
But does it involve whiskey,
gangs, patricide? I can't say.
But can I imply that her past
did not exactly include a dog named Lassie
and a lot of family talks about the Bible
while grammy sat doing macramé?
Can I suggest if… Mark, empty.
Can I suggest if you knew Heather's past,
making her feel briefly sad,
nauseous, and/or horrified,
it might not seem like
the worst idea in the world?
[sighs]
I don't know.
Am I a monster, Jeff?
Do I remember birthdays around here?
Who took you up
in his seaplane that one time?
- You.
- Yeah. And when we had
that outbreak of athlete's foot,
and your feet were rashed up,
did a certain individual
rush to pick up a prescription,
paying for it with his own personal money?
- That was nice.
- Yeah.
Seems unprofessional to bring up now.
Come on, Jeff,
what do you want me to say here?
Huh? Your Free Fridays are at risk?
[stumbling] Look,
I'm trying to help, Mr. Abnesti.
Steve!
Can you make a call for me?
Yeah, all right.
Let me give it a shot. Okay? BRB.
[sighs]
Lizzy.
Uh, Mr. Abnesti.
- My father in the room? [chuckles]
- Huh?
Who am I kidding?
He split when I was eight.
Shit, man. I'm sorry.
We're so happy to have you, Lizzy,
and not just 'cause of
your culinary skills.
You won best brisket
at the Prescott Barbecue Festival,
three years running?
How did you know that?
- It's my business to know.
- Wow.
You know, myself,
- I find brisket a little bit fibrous, but…
- Hmm.
Okay.
Did we snag you
those copper pots you're after?
I've been meaning to thank you.
Stop it, stop it, unnecessary.
You've been such a welcome addition.
- It's the least I could do.
- Thank you.
Mm.
In fact, you know, you made me feel, uh…
Made me feel a little bit foolish.
- Foolish?
- Yeah.
Just, you get someone's file
and, uh, you form these preconceptions,
even when you know
there were plenty of circumstances
and not so many fair shakes.
You still judge.
Hmm.
Anyone else here, um, know?
Oh, no. Our little secret.
Yeah.
[slurps]
Whoo!
This is good. A thousand copper pots
for Java like this. [chuckles]
Or maybe a field trip?
An Arizona girl-in-the-sunshine, huh?
Hi, Jeff. Uh…
I'm sorry, man.
Unfortunately, the committee
was very firm.
They insisted the test must be
continued as scheduled.
Otherwise, they're threatening
to remove you from this program
and send you back to State.
They need you to acknowledge, Jeff.
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
one last time. Drip on?
Yeah, acknowledge.
Thank you.
Heather, hello again.
Good morning, again.
Drip on?
Acknowledge.
Okay, Mark.
{\an8}- [chimes]
- [MobiPak whirring]
[whirring stops]
I don't like this.
[groans softly]
Please. It's hurting.
What's wrong with me?
- [Abnesti] It can't hurt you.
- [whimpering] Shit.
[vomits]
Jeff, speak a lot, in detail.
Let's make something useful with this.
- [chimes]
- [MobiPak whirring]
[Heather coughing]
[MobiPak beeps]
Heather just vomited.
She appears to be
in a highly aversive state.
[Abnesti] Why don't you back us up?
What happened first?
[Jeff] She started to cry.
She seems confused by how she's feeling.
[whimpers]
[sobbing]
[Jeff] Now she's crying harder.
She seems unable to sit still.
And what are you feeling?
[breathing heavily]
- Melancholy. Culpability.
- [Heather] Oh, no, please.
[Abnesti] Mm-hmm.
Go on.
[Heather] No, no, no.
All I can think
is Heather was once a child.
- Loved by her mother and father…
- [panting]
…neither foreseeing that
one day she might do a terrible thing.
A thing that would separate her
once and for all from love.
Good, go on.
Divorce her from joy
and cause her unspeakable sadness.
And do you love her?
[screeching]
Help! Please! Please!
No.
[Abnesti] Hang in there, Jeff.
Hey, Mark. Any vestige of romantic love
- in Jeff's words?
- [MobiPak cracks]
- [Mark] No.
- [Abnesti] Great.
- [Mark] Just basic human feeling.
- [beeping rapidly]
[Abnesti] Excellent.
- [remote beeping]
- Steve.
{\an8}- [Abnesti] Mm?
- [Mark] I think it's flooding.
Get back!
Back off.
- I did. The effects not...
- [Heather shouting indistinctly]
[Abnesti] Try more red.
Heather is in great torment.
- [Abnesti] Back it off.
- [Mark] It's not working.
Heather, listen to me. Sit down,
don't raise a finger, that's an order.
Get away from me, please!
- [Heather screaming]
- Are you kidding me?
{\an8}Are you fucking kidding me?
Jesus.
This is bad. Get in there, go.
Shit.
Heather's destroying everything
within reach.
[Abnesti] Sit down.
That is an order.
I'm responsible.
Stay the fuck away from me!
I facilitated...
Heather, listen to me, deep breaths,
everything's gonna be fine, okay?
Just relax.
[Abnesti] Heather!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
[Mark] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[Mark] Oh, my God.
[Mark] Oh, shit!
Oh, my God.
[Abnesti] Oh, shit.
God damn it, Mark.
[Mark] I don't feel a pulse.
What is wrong with you?
I told you to back it off.
[Mark] What? What?
What? I… I did back it off.
- [Abnesti] Forget your…
- [Mark] I told you this would happen.
[Abnesti] She did not respond
to my direct order.
[Mark] You're talking shit.
You are afraid to commit…
I told you every time, don't hesitate!
{\an8}I give an instruction, do what I say!
"Abnesti Pharmaceuticals"?
[Mark] Steve, I warned you.
- You did not.
- [Jeff] This is his company.
- I told you.
- Do not blame me!
You did not listen, I told you.
This is your fault.
[Mark] I told you. I told you.
- [Mark] Give me… [continues indistinctly]
- [Abnesti] You remember that?
[both arguing indistinctly]
"Bingo"?
[Mark] You think I have one job?
[argument continues indistinctly]
N-40.
Can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?
Acknowledge.
You see this remote?
{\an8}Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx.
I-16.
What the hell?
- [Mark] Where are you going?
- [Abnesti] Shut up, Mark.
B-6.
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,
they can flood.
[dramatic orchestral music pulsing]
[panting]
[panting softly]
It's not your fault.
Not your fault.
["Peppermint Park" playing on stereo]
[Ray whistling]
[Mark] This has gone too far.
We need to report this.
Grow up. You shouldn't act like
we've crossed some sort of line here.
The time to worry about crossing lines
was a lot of lines ago.
If anyone finds out
what happened to Heather,
they'll shut us down, Mark.
Everything I've accomplished will be lost,
and don't think
they'll just come after me.
You'll go down too.
[Mark] Yeah.
[sighs heavily]
[Abnesti] Hey.
I'm sorry.
Okay, this was awful.
But what do I always tell you? Hmm?
Pressure forms diamonds.
[chuckling] Yeah.
This is fine, okay?
You and I,
we're gonna redouble our efforts.
We're gonna gold star B-6,
and we'll change the world, Mark.
And Heather?
Heather died for the best of causes, okay?
Okay.
"Okay" okay?
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
- Yeah? Sure? Huh?
[laughing] Come on, there you are.
Hey, just go take some time, relax.
Whatever helps you forget,
get out of here, go on.
[door closes]
Damn it.
[breathing heavily]
Is she dead?
She's not the best.
That's not fair. Yeah. Yes, she's gone.
This, uh… You know, this is science, Jeff.
And in science,
we have to explore the unknown.
The unknown can lead to the unforeseen,
- and we had no way of predicting that...
- I get it.
[Abnesti] Uh, your tone
of voice there, Jeff,
which I perfectly understand.
But be fair. You think
what happened today, you think I liked it?
I didn't. I'm a person too, you know, I…
I have feelings, and no one
is more broken up about this than me.
But in the long run,
our work will help ease suffering,
it'll save lives,
not just one life, many lives.
We're making the world a better place.
Are we?
[Abnesti] Yes, Jeff, we are.
You should be proud.
Personal sadness aside,
you did terrific in there.
We all did terrific. Heather, especially.
Right up into the point where she…
You know, it wasn't her finest moment,
but everything prior to that,
she was doing great
and she'll never be forgotten.
What?
It's just tough.
Yeah.
Can I get you something
for how you're feeling?
[relaxing music playing]
[both laughing]
[Abnesti] I swear,
G-46 is good shit, right?
[Jeff] Yeah.
[Abnesti] Maybe not change-the-world shit,
but it's good shit.
[Jeff] It's definitely good shit.
It's hard to have
even one sad thought on this stuff.
What's your worst memory?
What?
I'm sorry, that's a stupid question.
Mine, uh… [clears throat] Mine was… I was…
I was eight years old
and, uh, my dad told me
he was gonna take me to summer camp.
I was so excited.
And he dropped me off,
and it turns out it wasn't summer camp,
it was foster care…
[laughing]
…and I never saw him again.
Oh, my God.
I'm laughing too.
That's just so terrible, man.
It seems funny. Try it.
He never came back.
He never came back.
Not even for a weekend.
I'm actually sorry to hear that, man.
Damn.
Oh, the dose is too strong.
God. [sighs]
Man, look at us, huh?
Jeff and Steve.
Steve and Jeff hanging out.
Friends.
Ehh…
- What?
- [laughing]
Come on, we're up here together.
Enjoying the view.
That's a friendly thing to do.
You can… Well…
You can walk out that door
anytime you want.
I can't.
No, I can't. Not anymore.
What's stopping you?
The same thing that's stopping you
and every decision I've ever made.
The ones that led me here to this place.
This is my one true love, Jeff.
And once you fall in love,
it's hard to fall back out.
[laughing]
Okay.
Jeff and Steve… stuck at summer camp.
To Jeff and Steve. Not that different.
[both laughing]
[screaming]
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Lizzy, listen. Deep breaths.
Everything's gonna be fine.
[Lizzy] Please!
For the record, can you tell us
what you're so afraid of?
Get it the fuck away!
The Verbaluce isn't doing shit.
Yeah. [chuckles]
This one's a goodie.
Phobica.
[Lizzy] Please stop it! Please stop!
Make people afraid of things
that are bad for them.
What, like gluten?
Yeah. Or thinking too much.
[static]
[whimpering]
Please, get that fucking thing
away from me!
[Mark] I'm worried about
post-traumatic stress.
From the stapler?
Hey, Lizzy? Lizzy, it's just a stapler.
Just get away now!
[Mark] What, should we pack it in?
Steve, should we pack it in?
- Yeah, okay.
- [whimpering]
[Lizzy] The worst one yet. By far.
How do you feel now?
Not afraid. Just, uh… [sighs]
Ashamed?
Yeah, I hate that feeling.
[sighs]
I couldn't stand
feeling that way in front of you.
That's why I asked to be off snack.
[sighs]
You know, all the years I spent at State.
I come here, and I'm, like…
Is this place even really so much better?
Hmm.
I mean, I'd take some beat downs.
Instead of having a fear
of a goddamn stapler.
[Jeff chuckles softly]
Why do we keep saying yes?
Acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge.
And for what? A private hall pass?
A bedroom to ourselves?
Copper freakin' pots? I mean…
[sighs]
All the times you've said yes,
why did you?
I guess I felt like I deserved it.
That's what I've been
meaning to tell you, Lizzy.
[Emma] Yeah. I think I might go with them.
Hey.
Hey. Wait up.
- [Jeff] She can't live without me.
- [man chuckles]
[engine revving]
You cool to drive?
Ice cold.
Whoo!
[imperceptible]
[all laughing]
Whoo!
Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!
- Jeff! [screams]
- [Emma screams]
[fire crackling]
[grunting and panting]
Emma. Come on, baby. Come on.
Emma! Come on, baby. Come on.
[breathing heavily]
[whimpers]
[Jeff, over phone] Hey, babe.
I know you're probably getting sick of me
leaving these things for you,
but I just wanted to tell you
the usual that I miss you…
- And I'm sorry.
- [line beeps]
[voicemail] The mailbox
for this customer is full.
It cannot receive
any more messages at this time.
[imperceptible]
I'm so sorry.
Two counts, voluntary manslaughter.
And that doesn't include Heather.
Don't do that to yourself.
That's not on you.
You did everything you could.
No.
I said "acknowledge."
And I don't even know why.
You're a good soul.
[door opens]
[footsteps approaching]
- We're bad. We're very bad. [laughs]
- [chuckles]
For what it's worth, I think
we're the least of all evils in here.
Yeah? What makes you say that?
You hear things.
Oh, you hear things?
Yeah. You know Ray?
Mm-hmm.
So, after four times in jail for drugs,
Ray went to rehab
and then to what they call
a rehab refresh,
which is basically for people
who are so immune to rehab,
- it stops working.
- Hmm.
But he must have been immune to that too,
because then came his biggie.
Triple murder.
Yeah, his dealer, the dealer's sister,
and the dealer's sister's boyfriend.
Shit, man.
You know Rogan?
- Big diesel Rogan. Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Who doesn't know Rogan?
- He came home.
Found his girlfriend cheating on him
and threw her out an eight-story window.
Oh, shit.
She did not survive.
[chuckles]
Crazy.
Yeah, I don't get it.
- Like, how's it possible, man?
- What?
If we're all so bad, where's the bad?
[Abnesti] You guys are up late.
Yeah.
Cheat day.
Oh, Jeff, we may wanna reconsider
the community snack bowl, given, uh…
Shit-finger.
Yeah. Have a wonderful evening.
- And you.
- And you.
[whispering] Bingo.
[MobiPak beeps]
[MobiPak whirring]
[Abnesti] Yes.
Okay. I understand. Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Hey, Jeff, thanks for coming in.
How're you feeling?
Uh, I'm good.
All right, good. Uh, listen,
this breaks my heart wide open.
But Protcom are insisting
on one last trial to establish a baseline.
Uh, we…
You have to administer Darkenfloxx
to someone you've never shared N-40 with.
Someone who?
That's what breaks my heart, Jeff.
It really does.
Eh, Mark, if you would.
[remote beeps]
No. Sorry, I can't do it.
Of course you can, Jeff.
This is the last time
anyone's gonna get Darkenfloxxed, okay?
Yeah, uh, Lizzy doesn't deserve this.
It won't go as far this time.
You have my word.
You're not listening to me.
Jeff, come on. You sound nothing like
the guy that first arrived here.
That guy would've done anything
to make his crime right.
[shouts] Would you just shut up, man?
I'm not doing it.
Calm.
Maybe we should take the night. Yeah?
Things always feel better in the morning.
Yeah, sure.
Just remember, Jeff, uh, what you did
won't have to happen to anyone again.
Drugs like this
will prevent places like this.
No more damage, no more damaged people.
Only you can prevent another you.
Double his dose.
I know you're struggling,
but this will help.
What's in the red one?
- [Etch A Sketch clatters]
- Sorry.
[Jeff] It's just a toy.
The red one's a placebo. We put it...
Stop.
Just stop.
There is no Protocol Committee, is there?
This is his company.
I saw his letterhead.
[imperceptible]
Abnesti Pharmaceuticals.
He's the one in charge
and he's naming the drugs
using a goddamn Bingo card, Mark.
What are you doing
working at a place like this?
I mean, all this talk of N-40,
I call bullshit, man.
Abnesti doesn't care about love.
No, he cares about the red one.
B-6.
How can you go along with this?
You could work anywhere.
Why here? Why him?
There are so few geniuses.
He promised me we would change the world.
I just wanted to help people.
[case beeps]
You still can.
[ominous music cresendos]
[case chimes]
[chuckling] Hey, Jeff, man of the hour.
Hope you got some sleep,
thought things over, yeah?
Why don't you, uh, take the driver's seat?
Mark's out today.
He's got a stuffed up nose
or something. [laughs]
Millennials, huh?
Sorry, that's a… It's an unfair word.
You think about it,
someone arbitrarily decides
that everyone born between this date
and that date, they all act the same.
It's like a… A horoscope, but stupider.
You and Mark are nothing alike.
I don't know.
It was Mark who made me reconsider.
Ah.
Well, I'll forgive his sniffles.
Anyway, so it's you and me
and Lizzy, makes three.
How're you doing, Lizzy?
Could use some Vitamin D.
[Abnesti] We'll get you
some sunshine soon enough.
All right, Jeff.
Uh, I filled Lizzy's vials with
the last of the Darkenfloxx this morning.
Dumped the rest. Gone.
Shall we put this thing
behind us for good?
Fine. Let's do this.
[clears throat]
Lizzy? Drip on?
Yeah, acknowledge.
[Abnesti] And, Jeff,
give Lizzy the Darkenfloxx.
[delicate music playing]
Sorry.
Hmm?
The answer is still no.
[sighs] J… Jeff.
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
[exhales]
Okay. What are we
up against here, Jeff? Huh?
You think you love her?
You don't even know her.
I swear, the judgment on display
in this fucking building!
How about
a little share circle, huh? Yeah.
Why don't you
tell Jeff what you're in for?
- I don't care.
- [Abnesti] That's what love is.
Getting to know each other.
Let's get to know each other.
Doesn't matter. She already told me.
- Oh, did she? [laughs]
- Robbery. Big deal.
Really? Is that what you told him, Lizzy?
Your future husband, father of your kids.
He deserves to know the truth.
Tell him. Come on.
Hmm?
You don't have to.
[Abnesti] Come on. Tell him.
Come on, Lizzy, tell him. Tell him.
No? All right, I'll do it. Okay?
It's cool. I got your files right here.
Let's, uh… Let's see.
Yeah? Let's find out about Lizzy.
- Get to know each other.
- I don't need you to.
- I know who I am and what I've done.
- Elizabeth Dianne Harris.
Born in Prescott, Arizona.
- Raised in a group home…
- I don't need you to. I know who I am.
I know who I am!
I'm the mother who killed her baby.
That's who I am, Jeff.
[voice breaking] The mother
who forgot her little girl in her car
at a Walmart parking lot
in July for three hours…
While I went to work.
One count, reckless endangerment.
One count, manslaughter
of my nine-month-old little girl.
My own…
My own flesh and blood.
Now, I don't know what kind of
sick-ass experiment this is,
but whatever he wants you to do to me,
come on, let's get on with it, okay?
The quicker we get over with,
it'll be better for all of us. [sniffles]
Come on, man. You can't hurt me.
[gulps]
You can't hurt me.
There's no greater pain
than having to wake up
every fucking morning without her. Okay?
And I know you think you love me,
but anything in me worth loving
died with her long ago.
So, come on. Let's do it.
Come on. Give it to me.
Fucking give it to me.
Give it to me! Fucking do your job, Jeff!
Give it to me!
[sobbing]
Give it to me.
Please.

Sorry.
What's so funny?
Uh, no… [clears throat]
Her sitting in there, this whole thing,
you with that phone,
everyone acting all serious.
{\an8}Is it just me who finds this amusing?
{\an8}[chimes]
{\an8}[Jeff] Yeah.
{\an8}- Only you.

- Give me that.
- No.
Stop it. Stop it, you're scaring me, okay?
- Just stop. Stop. Please don't hurt me.
- [chimes]
Don't… Don't hurt me. Okay?
- [chimes]
- [whimpers] Oh, fuck. Christ.
[groans]
God…
Mark spiked my MobiPak.
That's right. He emptied my MobiPak
and gave you Darkenfloxx.
[Jeff] He's coming back here
right now with the police.
[Abnesti] How could he?
He and I… You and I were…
[groans] Make it stop!
- Can I get you something…
- Make it stop!
…for how you're feeling?
That was the first thing you said to me…
[groans]
…the acknowledgement that you needed
for the most important study of them all.
- And what did we say?
- Yes!
What were we saying yes to, huh?
What were we agreeing
to put in our bodies every single day?
- B-6.
- [screams]
It doesn't make you
happy or hungry or horny.
It makes you do as you're told.
"Laugh, stop laughing.
Eat, stop eating. Fuck, stop fucking!"
You weren't testing those other drugs.
You were testing B-6.
Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- [chimes]
- [gasping]
- [MobiPak whirring]
[MobiPak beeps]
What were you gonna call it?
[panting]
Fine then.
{\an8}[chimes]
{\an8}[chimes]
What were you going to call it?
[MobiPak beeps]
O-B-D-X.
Obediex.
[Jeff] And it did work.
Enough for you to live amongst killers.
But not enough for a gold star. Why?
B-6 had to be perfect.
The goal wasn't obedience.
It was absolute obedience
without exceptions.
We had to know,
could we get you to follow an order
antithetical to
your deepest values and emotions.
Do the very thing
you'd least want to do in the world.
Hurt someone you love.
B-6 could force you to repeat
the precise act you most regretted,
to harm another,
someone you held dear.
It could force anyone to do anything.
[Jeff] I trusted you.
We trusted you with our lives!
You made us do
all this shit to each other,
thinking it was our choice,
but it was yours.
You took away our...
Your what? Your free will, Jeff?
Oh, God. Where did that get you, huh?
Can't you picture it?
A world filled with people
who do as they're told.
[grunts]
We'd be selling peace and harmony itself.
The ability to compel people to act
on behalf of the greater good.
Behave, not as they want,
but as they damn well should.
No more drunks crashing cars.
Husbands killing wives.
Kids left at summer camp.
What does it matter? B-6 failed.
I want you to tell the world
what you did to Heather.
[whimpering] Man, I could go to…
I could go to prison, it would ruin me.
Everything I built.
I could go to prison, Jeff.
Jeff and Steve. Not that different.
[sniffles]
Yeah.
[laughs]
What's so funny?
[sighs]
You were free to go seven months ago.
And Lizzy, her appeal
just fell on very sympathetic ears.
She's been free for a week.
She's walking out of here. Today.
[grunting]
Open the front door.
- [chimes]
- [grunts]
- [chiming]
- [lock clicks]
{\an8}[Jeff] I'm gonna make sure
you never do this to anyone ever again.
[breathing heavily]
[metal clicks]
Give me the knife.
I said… give it to me.
Why?
Because I told you to, Steve,
and because I put enough B-6
in your veins to tame a goddamn lion.
[MobiPak whirring]
[remote chimes]
Really works, huh?
Not when someone has been told
to kill the only thing he's ever loved.
I learned that from you.
[grunts]

I just Darkenfloxxed Lizzy.

- It's okay. You're okay.
It's okay.
I'm so… I'm so sorry.
For what?
I'm sorry I lied.
Lizzy, I love you.
Nothing you said or did
is gonna change that.
[buzzing]
["She Blinded Me With Science" playing]
[intercom chiming]
Friends and neighbors,
I'm sorry to interrupt,
particularly with news like this.
We have an attempted escape.
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy.
[chuckling]
[strained grunts]
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy,
and it saddens me to my core
that they have misled the authorities
who are on the way here now.
I explained that that would mean
the end of the program
and the comfortable life that it affords
us all, but they wouldn't listen.
- [strained grunts]
- [beeping]
Oh, no.
[straining] Do any of you relish
the thought of returning to State?
What would you
be willing to do to prevent that
to preserve the noble mission…
Fuck!
…to which we've devoted our lives?
- [gasping]
- [beeping intensifies]
Fucking piece of shit!
[shudders]
{\an8}Stop Jeff and Lizzy, not for me, for you.
{\an8}[beeping rapidly]

Fuck!

I have a key to the pantry.
It has food in it for, like, six months.
Awesome. Thanks.

[Jeff] I wish there was
a self-forgiveness drug.
You take it and everything starts over.
Everyone you ever loved,
you did right by them.
Treated them like gold
and you feel like it's all ahead of me.
This beautiful life,
all the pleasures of it.
The love I could give,
the good I could do.
But there's no drug like that.
So, we're gonna
have to do it for ourselves.
