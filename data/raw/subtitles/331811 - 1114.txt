I'm on my way back
from Benny's.
I'm almost home.
You tell me where you are,
I'll come get ya.
Ha. I wouldn't say
I'm drunk.
Ha ha. Hello?
Are you still there?
OK.
# Tonight #
# Tonight, to-to-tonight #
# Well, all right #
# Tonight #
# Tonight #
# Wait, now #
# Wait #
# Now #
# Wait #
Ohh!
Oh, shit.
Shit.
A-Are you all right?
This is the fifth time
this year.
How many is it gonna take...
for the state
to put a fence up?
Which way'd it go?
Hmm?
The deer.
Where'd it go?
Oh. Uh...
I th... That way.
Oh, poor thing.
You sure you're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just a little
shaken up, that's all.
Hey, I have
my new cell phone with me.
I can call the police for you.
No! No, th-that's OK.
I, uh...
They're on their way already.
I'll call.
Chief's a friend of mine.
No, it's all right. You really
don't have to do that.
No, it's no trouble.
I pay for this thing.
I never use it.
I live just up the hill.
You're welcome to wait
there if you want.
No, thanks.
I told them I'd be here.
Yes. Calling about
another deer collision...
Musta leaped.
I'm sorry?
There's no damage
to your radiator.
Usually, you'd be pickin'
kneecaps outta your grill.
Are you injured?
Heh. No, sir.
You had anything
to drink tonight?
Nope.
I'll need your license
and registration.
Of course.
I don't have
my license on me.
I must have left it at home.
It's unlawful to operate a
motor vehicle without a license.
I have one.
I just... I left it.
Forgot it.
Your name's Jack Levin?
Levine.
Levine?
You're the owner
of this vehicle?
That is correct.
Mr. Levine, would you object
to a breathalyzer?
I prefer a sobriety test.
That's your right.
Please step out of the car.
Sober up. You can do this.
Right back here.
Recite the alphabet backwards.
Um...
Go ahead.
Z-Y-X-W-V-U-T...
Um...
S-R-Q...
P-O-N-M-L-K-J-l-H...
# G-F-E-D-C-B-A #
You want me to walk
a straight line or anything?
No, that won't be necessary.
OK.
Wait here.
Mr. Levine...
your license to drive
was revoked three months ago...
following a D.U.I. charge.
I'm placing you under arrest
and impounding your vehicle.
Oh, please, not the car.
Turn around, place
your palms flat on the trunk.
Right now.
Sorry about the tie.
Out of cuffs.
What's in the trunk?
You need a warrant
to look in the trunk.
I know the law.
Oh, really?
So then you know the term
"exigent circumstance"?
There's nothin' in there
but an old tarp.
See?
You sick fuck.
I...
You think just because
you didn't shoot her...
you can cart her off?
Her?
I don't see any antlers, do you?
It's not even season yet.
Well, I didn't think
it should go to waste.
I mean, I know venison
is expensive, but Jesus.
She's messed up really badly.
I don't think
you want to look at...
Did I ask you?
Got her wedged in here
pretty good.
Fuck!
L-Car-1 to dispatch, over.
Go ahead, George.
Overpass collision
not a deer, but a man.
Repeat, a man.
Locate next of kin for...
name: Aaron Lewis.
Lima, Echo, Whiskey,
India, Sierra.
Driver in custody.
Request assistance.
Jesus, you're having
a rough night.
I'll get on the horn.
Sit tight.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.
You have a right
to an attorney.
I waive my Miranda rights.
What?
I waive my Miranda rights.
I'm sick of hearin' 'em.
Fine. Third time tonight.
I'm gettin' pretty
sick of 'em, myself.
Move over. You got company.
I was here first.
This isn't a cab.
Just shut up and move over.
There isn't any room.
Why don't you put him in front?
I need you to move
over right now.
I gotta put someone else
back here. Move over.
Duffy, can you move over?
Make some room.
I'm trying.
Fuck!
Duffy, come on!
Ohh!
Frank?!
Oh, it's you.
Have you seen my husband?
I sent him to look
for the deer.
I have to find him right away.
Can you help me?
I really have to get home.
Please? Something terrible...
Frank?
Uhh.
I'm OK.
Frank!
Frank, where are you?
This can't be happening.
What happened?
Chief, uh...
Garvey called.
My only child...
has been hit by a car.
They just called?
Right after I came home...
just, um... a few minutes
after I left you.
You...
Freeze!
Please step back, ma'am.
I tried to help you.
It was an accident.
Ma'am, step away.
Some goddamn deer!
It all happened so fast.
Let me handle this! Ma'am!
Are you drunk?
I'm sorry.
Ma'am, ma'am!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Calm down!
I'll kill you!
Aah! Uhh!
Ohh.
Huh? Huh?
Don't move!
You'll burn...
for what you did
to my daughter.
Daughter?
#... Just had
a heroin injection #
# Big slam
like you're droppin'... #
You're such a dick!
- Glad you could make it, Timmy.
- Dumbass.
Turn the fucking music down.
Shut up.
What'd you guys bring?
Well, observe.
Ahh, ahh...
Ohh, uhh...
ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh...
ohh, ohh, ahh...
What is that?
Ready?
Yes!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I am a god.
That's pretty sweet.
Except that's our first sign
he's hit all fuckin' night.
You can shut up now.
Now, what's with the books?
You're gonna burn a book?
It's not like this is great
fucking literature or anything.
I'm doing the world a favor.
Just don't light that shit
in my car, all right?
Shit.
Now, come on, man!
Aah! Jesus, Eddie!
Come on, God!
Dude, you just broke my box.
Yeah, well, your mom
told me that last night.
Gimme.
Lighter.
OK. See, what you gotta do
is crumple the pages...
so you can get
the air in there, OK?
- Ahh.
- Ahh.
Check this out.
Check this out.
Look, look, look, look.
Yeah!
Sorry!
How the fuck did
you pass your driving test?!
Hey, listen, Tim, if you're
gonna keep complaining...
we're just gonna
take your ass home, OK?
So shut the fuck up.
Try it now. All right.
Get it! Get it right...
Get it right up here.
Get it right there.
Ohh, shit!
Open the window!
Open the window!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Aah! Fuck me, man!
That was my head!
All right, new fuckin' rule.
No more of that shit,
all right?! Cut it out.
I gotta piss.
- How many of those have you had?
- Like, four.
Just hold on, all right? Wait'll
we get through the center...
and then I'll find a place
to pull over.
No, no time.
What the fuck are you doing?
What does it look like
I'm doing?
You're kidding me, right?
No! Just hangin' out!
You're fucking kidding me,
dude.
We need
to freshen out the van.
Jesus. No, no, no, no,
fuckin' no!
Yes!
# Yeah #
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Will you fucking cut it out?!
Look! You're gettin' it
all over my fuckin' car!
Spank it! Spank it!
Shit. What the fuck
just happened?
Who'd you...
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no...
Ohh, fuck.
What did you do, dude?
She's... She's...
She's gonna be OK.
She's gonna be fuckin' OK. Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck, go! Go!
Oh, fuck! Oh, my God!
Oh! Ohh! Oh!
Oh, my God.
Is everybody all right? Ohh!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, Jesus.
Stop the car.
Are you fucking nuts?!
I'm not stopping
this fucking car!
- Pull over!
- What the fuck?!
- Pull over!
- What the fuck?!
Never touch this fucking wheel!
Calm down!
My mom doesn't even know
I have the goddamn car!
Hey, keep pressure on it.
Here, here, here,
no, it's OK...
Here, here, here, here. OK.
Holy shit! He's shot!
No, man, his dick got...
Fuck me.
We gotta get him
to the hospital.
No.
What do you mean no, Eddie?
Jesus, look at you.
We have to go back
and get it first.
Eddie, you're bleeding
pretty bad.
Maybe we should just
take you to the hospital.
l... I don't want
to live like this!
Please.
We're going back.
What the fuck?!
We were... We were
just fucking shot at!
We're going back!
I am not going back there, Tim!
Come on, man!
Look at him!
Fine. I'll just do it myself.
Hey. Don't worry, all right?
I'm gonna find it.
Hurry.
Tim, it's been cut off.
They can reattach it.
Well, how the fuck
are they gonna do that?
What am I, a surgeon?
They use leeches and shit.
This is so stupid!
What about the cops?!
Just be here
when I get back!
Fuck.
That was fast.
Hey, Kev, you want
to grab me a cover for her?
Want to grab me a cover, Kev?
Yeah, you got it.
Where do we put it?
Uh, they're in the front.
Got it.
Here's the license.
Call it in.
Shit. I used to baby-sit her.
Call it in, Kevin.
OK.
What happened?
It was a hit-and-run.
Need any help?
Ha. I got it. Thank you.
Ready? One, two, three.
Got it.
Whoa. You OK, Kev?
I don't feel so hot.
We got a frozen dick we gotta
get to the hospital, man.
I know, I know, I know.
Listen, it happens to everybody
the first time.
Here. You want a smoke?
Yeah, thanks.
Ohh, gross.
We're sorry.
You know something about this?
Friend of yours lose something?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Yeah? Then what the fuck
are you doin' in there?
I just...
need a new cooler.
You should just
tell me the truth.
I am.
I'm a klepto.
Dr. Fowler says that
I'm makin' progress...
but I still have
a long way to go.
What, do you think
this is funny?
I never said it was funny.
This kid's full of shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?
Home.
No, you're not.
Come with us.
Yeah. The cops are gonna
want to talk to you.
I didn't do anything.
There's a person
in this ambulance...
and she's dead...
and I think
you're the reason why.
Where's my daughter?
Where's Cheri?
Fuck!
Ecch.
Go! Go!
Oh, shit!
Go, go, go, go!
Jump in! Jump in, Tim!
Are you OK?
Are you all right?!
Did you get it?
Did you get it?
Don't say
I never did anything for you.
Oh, shit! Cops!
Don't worry. He's busy.
Sorry it took me so long, man.
I was lookin'
for something bigger.
Oh, hey...
I'm sorry.
Even if they put it back on...
it's not gonna
work the same.
Sure, it will.
Your dick's like Timex, dude.
We're gonna have to
go to the police, man.
Well, that's easy
for you to say, Tim.
You weren't the one
that was driving.
Well, what do you want
to do, Mark?
We can't just skip town.
He saw our faces.
Well, I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying
let's get our story straight.
OK?
OK.
OK. Um...
OK, Eddie was
pissin' out the window.
OK, yeah, Eddie was
pissin' out the window...
but, uh, but I never
turned around, ya know?
I never turned around.
I was never hitting him...
and... and she just
ran out in front of me...
and I didn't have time
to stop.
OK.
Did you hear that, Eddie?
I never hit you.
Why should I lie?
Wh... What are you
talking about?
Why should I lie
when this is all your fault?
My fault? How the fuck
is this my fault?
Well, if ya hadn't been so
worried about your paint job...
my penis would be
in my pants right now...
and not in my fucking hand!
If you hadn't have been pissin'
out the goddamn window...
none of this
would have happened!
Guys, calm down.
No, you stay out of this, Tim!
Now, listen, I'm not going
to jail over your little dick...
so you can either say
I didn't hit you...
or you can bleed
to death for all I care!
Say it!
You didn't hit me.
Its expandable
stomach allows the Komodo...
to devour up to eighty percent
of its body weight...
in a single meal.
Mulligan, come on.
You have a good nap, boy?
We're gonna go
for a little walk.
No, no, no, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Cheri, oh, God,
what have you done?
Oh, you little pervert.
You left her no choice,
didn't you?
No.
No, I will not see you
ruin her life.
No.
OK, what do we do? Ohh.
No. Come on.
Stay.
Stay, stay. Stay, boy.
Oh, no.
Freakin' imports!
OK.
Oh, God.
Ohh...
Oh, no. Oh, no. No.
Please. Shit! Shit!
Oh, no. Son of a...
Stay. Stay.
OK.
Don't be
looking at me like that.
Cheri going to jail is
not gonna change anything.
The guy's dead.
Oh, my God.
Oh, that's better.
Stupid little shits!
Oh, my God.
God almighty.
Assholes.
Mulligan!
Mulligan, get down!
Mulligan.
OK.
Oh, Lord, please forgive me
for what I'm about to do.
OK.
Mulligan!
Mulligan, get over here.
Mulligan, come.
Mulligan, come here now.
Mulligan, come now.
Mulligan, come here.
That's my baby boy.
That's a good boy.
Come here.
Come here.
Yes, sweetheart.
No. No. No. No.
Come back, you dog.
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you.
Mulligan. Mulligan.
That's a good boy.
OK, dog, give me that thing.
Mulligan, come on!
There you are.
Ah, shit! Oh, shit!
Shit.
Come here.
Come here. Come here.
Mulligan.
Dog, I oughta rip you
a new asshole.
You bad dog.
Bad dog.
Now, where is it?
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.
Come on.
Frank?
Honey, what are you doing?
Well, l... I...
I caught these punk kids running
around, starting fires...
so I scared 'em off.
And, uh...
I was just trying to kick
this fire into the sewer.
Be careful. You don't wanna be
hurtin' your back now.
Oh, God, I know.
Hop in. You look tired.
Uh...
Come on, Mulligan.
Sit.
Oh, hi.
So, how was your night?
OK.
Just OK?
Yeah.
I wonder what happened.
Oh, that reminds me.
Another deer got hit tonight.
Really? Where?
Same spot just down
from our house.
Happened a few minutes ago.
So it ran into our woods...
and I want you to go see
if he's still alive.
Frank?
Huh? Um...
Yeah, OK.
Mulligan,
what have you been eating?
- Hit the lock.
- Ah.
Come on out, young fella.
Oh, thanks. Hey, you.
- You got him?
- Yeah.
Oh, here, here, here.
Take this.
'Cause if the deer's still alive
I don't wanna spook him.
Who could that be
at this hour?
OK, I'll see you later.
OK.
OK.
# OK, what is it tonight? #
# At least just tell me
what the hell is wrong #
# Do you want to eat? #
# Do you want to sleep? #
# Do you want to drown? #
# Just settle down,
settle down, settle down #
Hey, Duff.
What's going on?
Not much.
You want me
to lock up for you?
Yeah. It's about that time.
How was your shift?
Fucking boring.
Whole goddamn town
shuts down at nine o'clock.
What else is new?
Are you OK?
You don't look so good.
I got a call this morning.
From who?
Cheri.
So?
She's pregnant.
Are you sure it's yours?
Of course it's mine!
Whose the fuck else
would it be?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything.
Don't worry about it.
Just, it's fine.
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
She's gotta get
an abortion, right?
That's expensive.
Well, no shit,
it's fuckin' expensive.
That's my problem.
How much?
Five hundred dollars.
Guess a two-dollar condom's
lookin' pretty good...
right about now.
That's just it.
We were always safe.
I don't know how
this could've happened.
There's not much point
in worrying about it now.
We're closed.
Well, he's in there.
He works here.
Please. We'll be really fast.
I promise.
Come on.
Duff, I cashed out already.
- You're a prince.
- Thanks.
Those doughnuts are old.
Doesn't matter.
4.89.
What's in there?
Uh, Bong Water. Six.
9.48.
Keep the change.
You want one?
Yeah, they're old.
Blah!
She got any money?
No. Her dad
buys her everything...
and this is
obviously one bill...
that she doesn't
want him to see.
Well, what about you?
I blew my wad on
the new transmission last month.
So what are you gonna do?
Well, that's what I've been
thinking about all day.
I could ask my dad,
but there's just no way.
I thought about asking Lloyd
for an advance...
but you know how he is.
Yeah.
So that only leaves one thing.
I'm gonna rob this place.
Yeah, right.
No way.
No fucking way.
Lloyd finds
one bill missing...
and he's gonna fire me,
and I need this job.
My sister's sick.
You know that.
I know, and I'm sorry,
but I don't have a choice.
Well, take it on your own shift.
I can't.
She needs the money tomorrow.
Why?
Because her parents
are gonna be gone all day.
It's the only time she can go.
Well, she's just
gonna have to wait.
You're not taking any money
from here tonight...
and that's that.
I don't believe this.
Please, Buzzy,
just give me the money?
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Buzzy.
Would you shoot Cheri
if I needed money?
Oh, come on.
Why do you always
have to do this?
Well, would you?
Just tell Lloyd you were robbed.
Is that so hard?
I'm a bad liar.
But you won't be lying.
It's not like he's
got surveillance or anything.
He's been looking
for a reason to fire me anyway.
Are you gonna give me
the money or not?
Look...
you know I wanna help you.
Don't ask me to do this.
Melinda's got no insurance.
She needs
every dollar we've got.
Just... Come on. Just...
No. You do what you gotta do...
but I'm not gonna
open up this drawer.
God. Damn it.
Look at me.
Why, so you can
shoot me in the face?
Come on. Just look at me.
God damn it,
you're so stubborn!
Lloyd's an idiot
if he fires you!
Christ, he should
make you the manager!
Jesus.
Hey.
Hey. I gotta talk to you.
OK.
Be right back.
What's up?
Did you get the money?
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!
I didn't mean to.
Why?!
I didn't mean anything.
Give me that fucking thing.
Better get you out of here.
I'm dead.
I'm... I'm so dead.
Hey, could I borrow your jacket?
It's cold out.
Yeah.
I love you.
All right, you can
blame this on the robber.
Say he shot and missed.
Will you stop thinking
about your own problem...
for one minute?
I'm trying to save my job!
Buzzy, I am saving your job.
Think about it.
The cops are probably
on their way already.
How much cash
is in the register?
1,200 and change.
Duffy, no.
You're not thinking.
You're not thinking
things clearly here, OK?
This way, you get
to keep your job...
and then seven hundred dollars
goes straight to Melinda.
Good.
No, just take it all.
I'll get mine later.
Wait. One thing you have
to do for me before you go.
- What?
- Shoot me.
What?!
Lloyd will know
I'm lying in a second.
But if you shoot me...
I'm hurt, he can't
ask any questions.
Are you out of your mind?
No, I'm serious, Duffy.
I need this job.
I can't!
Duffy?
No. No.
I'll tell Cheri
about that time last summer.
You wouldn't.
All right.
All right.
Um, wait. No. Go over here.
That way it'll look like
it's a real robbery, you know?
All right, good thinking.
All right. OK.
All right.
Where do you want it?
In my arm.
Wait. I'm right-handed.
Here. My left arm.
All right.
Here.
There?
Yes. You can't shoot
through my arm.
- All right, are you sure?
- I'm sure.
- OK, right here.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
You ready?
You ready?
Ow! God.
Ow? That's nothing compared
to what it's gonna feel like.
Have you thought about
what it's gonna feel like?
It's gonna hurt.
Go.
Ready?
Goddamn it!
I can't fucking do it!
It's the worst idea
you ever had!
Duffy, you have to do this.
I can't do it.
As my friend, just do it.
I want you to do it.
Just make it quick
before I think.
All right.
We'll do it on three, OK?
Yeah. Yeah!
Three... three... three...
- You ready?
- Yeah.
One...
Ow! Ow!
Oh, my God!
I'm so fucking sorry!
I'm so fucking sorry!
Ow! You said on three!
I thought you might flinch.
I didn't wanna hit the bone.
What can I do?
I'm really sorry.
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean...
Then get me
something for my arm!
OK. I'm sorry.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, does it hurt?
Yes!
This was your idea!
It's not working!
Give it to me!
Get the phone!
OK, the phone. Why?
9-1-1.
I can't call 9-1-1.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Well, then, get it for me!
OK. It's not here.
The phone's not here!
Where's the fucking phone?!
The pager! Hit the pager!
Ow! Oh!
What the hell did you
put it over here for?!
Who puts the fucking phone
on the fucking shelf?
Ow!
OK, here. Here. Here.
Here. No, this side.
Go.
9-1-1 emergency.
Yeah. Uh...
Hi.
What is your emergency?
Uh, I was shot.
I'm all alone now,
and I need an ambulance.
Keys?
Fuck!
Thank you, baby.
Calm down.
Calm down, Duff.
Everything's cool.
Everything is cool.
Everything's cool.
Jesus, that was fast.
What the...

Who?
Those kids.
I don't know their names.
They're in a blue van.
Someone reported a suspect
fitting your description...
shooting a clerk at Lloyd's
a few minutes ago.
I know you work there.
The gun and the money?
How 'bout the penis?
How you guys doing?
George, we got the shooting
victim in the back, OK?
We got a human penis
right there by the curb.
Somebody's gotta be
looking for that.
I'm not getting a pulse.
One, two, three, four, five...
Mind stepping down for a second?
- Keep going.
- Massive head trauma.
We got a suspect
over in the car.
You wanna come take
a look at him?
Can you I.D. him for me?
He's over in the car.
Um... no.
What do you got to tell me?
Yes.
I should really stay in
the ambulance because of this.
Are you hearing
what I'm saying?
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...
in a court of law.
You have the right
to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one...
one will be appointed
for you.
Just breathe.
Do you understand those rights
as I have read them to you?
Yes?
I'm sorry.
L-Car-1 en route to station.
Robbery suspects in custody.
Be advised...
hit-and-run suspects
at large in a blue van.
Over.
Hey, we just got a call...
about a deer collision
under the overpass.
Be a hon and check it out
on your way back, OK?
Can it wait?
Sorry. Friend of the chief's.
Ten-four.
# Liked you when we
first met #
# I felt the stare
come across the floor #
# They say once you
taste a little #
# You're gonna want
a whole lot more #
Steph, what are you doing?
Calling you.
Has Aaron been over yet?
Never should've told you
about him.
Hmph. I can't believe
you're making them both pay.
Why shouldn't they?
I don't know whose it is.
Yeah, but they
could've split it...
if they knew about each other.
Heh. So when are you
having it done?
Tomorrow.
Are you scared?
Nah. Listen. I gotta go.
Aaron's here.
I'll call you later.
Coming up at eleven:
The Komodo dragon.
So, is that Aaron's car outside?
Yeah.
...not seeing him anymore.
I'm not.
I'm just hanging out.
Cheri.
Cheri.
I do not trust that guy.
So you said.
Look at me!
If he hits you again,
I'll kill him.
I can take care of myself.
This week,
we focus on nature.
Travel to the remote
Komodo Island in Indonesia.
What's up, baby?
Did you bring it?
Mm-hmm.
Let's see.
What? Don't you trust me?
Come on. Let's go
park down the street.
How can you think about sex
at a time like this?
Get in.
Not in your car again.
It's too small.
Let's go inside then.
My dad's home.
Shit.
Really want me?
Gonna have to
catch me first.
I'm gonna get you.
Come back here.
Come on, baby.
You know I'm gonna get you.
All right, I'm gonna
make you pay. Stop!
- Aah.
- Come on.
Oh, shit!
You're gonna get it.
You're in fuckin' trouble.
Come on. Come on.
You're mine now.
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Want me?
Yeah.
A check?
Yeah? So?
Better not bounce.
Where's your condom?
Uh, I didn't bring one.
What?
Duh. You're already pregnant.
Yeah, but other things.
Don't worry, baby. I'm clean.
Besides, it's the only time
we'll be able to do it...
without having to worry about
anything. You know what I mean?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Oh...
Huh?
Did you come?
Aah!
Don't pass out.
Don't pass out.
Don't pass out.
How'd it go?
Steph, can you keep a secret?
Of course. What is it?
Duffy just drove by
and saw us.
He saw you with Aaron?
Yeah. I've never
seen him so mad.
Oh, my God.
Duffy's gonna kill him.
...The world's
longest-living reptile.
- Where's Aaron?
- He left.
That's good.
What are you doing?
Is that blood? Are you bleeding?
Let me see.
I'm fine, all right?
I just cut my hand
on a pricker bush.
Are you OK?
- I'm fine, Dad.
- What happened?
Cheri.
Honey?
You can tell me.
You know I'm always
looking out for you.
Cheri.
Uhh!
Dad, have you seen my keys?
No.
Can I borrow your key
to the Honda?
Where are you going?
Dad, please.
You need to be more
careful with your keys.
Thanks.
You sure there's nothing
you wanna tell me?
Here the Komodo
dines on a fresh kill.
Goddamn piece of crap!
Shit!
Ooh ooh.
Girl!
Need some help?
Can I offer you a delicious
Bong Water?
How about a doughnut?
Forget it, dude.
She's going out
with Duffy Nichols.
You know Duffy?
Sure. He used to mow my lawn.
Yeah. We just saw him
over at Lloyd's.
Lloyd's?
You want a ride?
Nope. Thanks for the tip.
Whoo!
Fuck.
God damn it!
You're so stubborn.
Lloyd's an idiot
if he fires you!
Christ, he should make you
the manager!
Jesus.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I gotta talk to you.
OK.
Be right back.
What's up?
Huh?
What's up?
Did you get the money?
Sorry, babe.
I'm not gonna be able to get
it till work tomorrow night.
It's OK. I understand.
Ohh. What's gotten into you?
Can't a girl kiss her boyfriend?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I didn't mean to.
Why?
I didn't mean it.
Give me that fucking thing.
Better get you out of here.
I'm dead. I'm so dead.
Hey, could I borrow your jacket?
It's cold out.
Yeah.
I love you.
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.
Thank you.
Aah!
9-1-1.
Um, hi. I think...
I just saw a man shoot
the clerk at Lloyd's.
Can you describe
the suspect?
Uh, black t-shirt
and green pants.
Huhh.
Aaahh!
Hey, sexy.
I need you to come
and get me.
I thought you wanted
to leave tomorrow.
And now I wanna leave
now, all right?
OK. OK.
Did you get the money?
I got Aaron's.
What about, uh, Duffy's?
Did he find out?
Did he?
Does he know
you're not pregnant?
No. He believes me.
It's just
everything's fucked.
Where are you?
I'm on my way back
from Benny's.
I'm almost home.
You tell me where you are,
I'll come and get you.
I'm not home.
I'm in the Center.
Heh.
Are you drunk?
Ha! I wouldn't say
I'm drunk.
Look, just come and get me
so I can get my shit...
and get the fuck out
of this...
Cheri!
I got it!
My car won't start.
Hello? Are you still there?
Listen, I might get
Duffy's half after all.
I'll call you back.
# You keep saying
you've got something for me #
# Something you call love,
but confess, yes #
# You've been messin' where you
shouldn't have been a-messin' #
# And now someone else
is gettin' all your best #
# These boots
are made for walking #
# And that's just what
they'll do #
# One of these days, these boots
are gonna walk all over you #
# Yeah #
