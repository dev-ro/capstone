I'm sorry I'm Iate.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Yes.
[ Gasps ]
Look at what he brought you .
Look at that.
Isn't that pretty?
Oh , you know, you have
a wonderfuI husband
that thinks about you Iike that
on your anniversaries.
You're so fortunate!
It's beautifuI .
It's actuaIIy Teddy's fauIt

He had a IittIe accident
in the backseat,
cotton aII over the pIace,
but I cIeaned it up.
It's okay.
I forgive Teddy.
Hey, come on , Sara.
Don't be Iike that.
I'm on a roII here.
We soId seven houses this month .
What about

two birthday parties,
and barbecue you missed?
Did I miss that much stuff
this month?
Okay. We're gonna take off

What?
We're gonna take off

Megan and MichaeI ,

Hey!
MichaeI Jordan Evers!
Aah ! Aah !
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Dad ! There's a. . .
-What is it?
-There's a spider in my room !
-There's a what?
There's a spider in my room
on the window.
Why don't you kiII it, man?
That's a big spider!
Come on .
It's just a spider, MichaeI .
How big couId it be?
What is this?
Where's the spider at?
What? Man , you're acting
Iike it's Mothra.
It's just a spider.
You're making a big deaI
out of nothing , MichaeI .
You're 1 0 years oId .
It's time I teach you how to
kiII a spider the right way.
The most efficient way
to crush a spider.
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.
Some peopIe Iike to use ''Life''
or ''Time'' or. . .
This is my ''Sports IIIustrated''
Swimsuit Edition .
What are you doing with it?
-I don't know.
-Yeah , right.
If you can Iook at this,
you shouId have enough courage
to kiII a spider the right way.
So I'm gonna roII this up
so you get a good grip on it.
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing .
That's where you can reaIIy get
some good action going .
You want to come across Iike
that so you reaIIy crush it.
You come across this way so
you get his whoIe escape route
in case he try to go. . .
You take it, and you whack it.
Go on .
Whack the spider.
I don't want to whack it.
Come on , you got to whack
the spider, Mike. Whack it.
Dad , I'm afraid of spiders.
I can't whack it.
Let me expIain something to you .
AII your Iife you're gonna be
facing spiders, okay?
I am?
What I'm trying to say is
you shouId never be afraid .
PeopIe know,
they use that against you .
I'm not scared of anything .
I'm your dad , right?
You're my son .
You whack that spider.
I can't whack the spider, Dad .
Come on . Whack it.
You can do it. Whack the spider.
-I don't want to whack it.
-Yes, you can . Come on .
KiII the spider.
KiII the spider.
Dad , I can't crush it.
I can't whack it!
Hey.
There.
Happy?
No, I'm not happy, Megan .
I was trying to make a point
about how it's important
to whack your own spiders!
Whatever.
Mm-hmm .
RAMSLE Y:
Past the OId MiIIer Road .
Okay. Great.
It is an oId home, Ms. Evers.
And my empIoyer is anxious
to move on .
WouId it be possibIe

But my husband and I work

The master usuaIIy

However, from your photograph ,
he thought you to have
a trustworthy face.
About your husband ,
he feIt differentIy.
Oh .
You got our fIyer.
The master had wished
to meet you tomorrow evening .
Oh , I'm so sorry.
But tomorrow I've got pIans
that can't be broken .
Who is that?
-Excuse me a second .
-Who is that?
Just someone caIIing
about repping a house.
What's the address?
Where is it?
Sara, do you know
where this pIace is?
The pIaces up here are big
muItimiIIion-doIIar mansions.
This couId be big .
And what about
our big famiIy adventure?
JIM:
It's just a IittIe detour.
MEGAN :
How Iong is it gonna take?
No more than 20 minutes.
20 minutes tops.
You kids shouId be excited .
You're gonna see Mommy and Daddy
in reaI-estate action .
[ CeIIphone rings ]
Somebody's caIIing me.
Who's caIIing me?
HeIIo. Jim Evers,

Oh , no.

AII right?
Monday?
Monday sounds fantastic.
Okay.

We're gonna taIk on Monday.
MICHAEL:
Are we stiII in America?
JIM: Here it is, right here.
Okay? AII right?
Yeah , that's a whoIe Iot

They must have a big

That's some big possum .
[ Horn honks ]
[ Horn honks ]
Didn't they know we were coming?
Of course they knew.
Maybe there's a caII box
or something .
HeIIo?!
[ Horn honks ]
HeIIo!
The Evers are here!
[ Horn honks ]
Yes, we're here now!
Nobody's answering .
Now I got to get out in the dirt
with my brand-new shoes on .
Wow.
How are we gonna get in?
What if you give me a boost,
and I'II go around the back?
They're probabIy oId .
We'II surprise them .
You'II probabIy kiII them .
Let's just go.
It's getting Iate.
You know, Sara,
you give up too easy.
You got to be more patient.
The Evers way is to be patient.
AII right.
We're in business.
Let's go, Iet's go.
Let's do this.
[ Thunder rumbIes ]
Wow.
Bob ViIa wouId have
a fieId day with this pIace.
Hey, Megan ,
don't sIam the door Iike that.
It's very sensitive.
It's a car, Dad .
Ah !
It's not just a car.
It's a very deIicate piece
of machinery.
Shh . She didn't mean
what she just said .
She didn't mean that.
Come on .
Let's see what's around back.
I'm getting hungry.
Me too.
Don't worry.
We'II be 20 minutes tops.
MICHAEL: Hey, Dad ,
when we get to the Iake,
can I go to that pizza shop
where I ate that whoIe pizza,
and when we got to the cabin ,
I threw up and you stiII saw
the pepperoni chunks in it?
Yeah , we can go there if we can
avoid a repeat performance.
[ Birds crying ]
Wow.
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.
Oh , my God .
Dead peopIe?
Hey, honey.
You know they have, uh ,
dead peopIe in the backyard?
WeII , some peopIe have pooIs.
Some peopIe have private
cemeteries. It happens.
You're gonna seII a house

This historicaI sprawIing manor
with spacious grounds? Yes.
Hey, that's good .
We'II put that on the Iisting .
And Ieave out

We'II just stick
to the bright side.
Oh , no.
I got my good suit on .
Oh .
You think it's gonna stop?
Oh , I hope it's not raining
at the Iake.
When you're at work
with Mommy and Daddy,
you're aIways on
your best behavior, right?
Okay.
Whoo!
Look at the size
of these knockers.
Ever see anything
Iike that before?
HeIIo?!
Evers ReaI Estate!
Evers ReaI Estate!
HeIIo?
[ Echoing ]
Is anybody home?
HeIIo?
We're the Evers from
Evers & Evers ReaI Estate.
Hi !
Have you ever seen
anything Iike this?
Never.
Sara, this puts us
in a whoIe new Ieague.
SmeIIs Iike Grandma's house.
Worse.
SmeIIs Iike Grandma.
This pIace is just
a IittIe dusty.
We'II get a cIeaning crew to
come out here and shine it up.
This pIace wouId be sparkIing
from top to bottom .
Mom , this pIace has spiders.
[ Door hinges creaking ]
[ Thunder crashes ]
Sara Evers.
Yes, I'm Sara.
My name is RamsIey.
HeIIo, RamsIey.
I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers ReaI Estate
at your service.
We were not expecting . . .others.
Yes, we were on our way
out of town .
Yeah , then when we reaIized
the enormity
and compIexity
of your unique estate,
we wanted to commit
the fuII resources
of Evers & Evers ReaI Estate.
At Evers & Evers, we want you
to be happy forevers and evers.
PIease accept
this waterproof caIendar
as a token of our appreciation .
Very weII .
We shaII have to pIace
other settings.
Who do you have
the settings for?
Master Gracey wishes to discuss
his affairs over dinner.
Oh , I'm afraid we have pIans.
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.
Oh , yes.
But we mustn't be rude, darIing .
What about our famiIy adventure?
Yeah , Dad .
We'II just have some soup,
and then we'II get going , okay?
AII right?
Wow.
Wow.
Nice.
Very nice.
Good job.
Good job.
Hey, Megan , how'd you Iike to
eat Iike this every day at home?
The master wiII be
with you shortIy.
Carry on .
I said , ''Carry on .''
He waIks off.
Have you ever seen
a firepIace this amazing?
IncredibIe.
Ah , we couId have one heck of a
wienie roast in that thing , huh?
SeriousIy.
Look at this detaiI .
I've never seen
anything Iike this.
-[ Thunder crashes ]
-Haven't you?
My grandfather spared no expense
when he buiIt this mansion .
WeII , your grandfather had
reaIIy good taste in tchotchkes.
I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers ReaI Estate.
Charmed to make
your acquaintance, sir.
Edward .
Edward Gracey.
Uh , this is my wife, Sara.
You want to come meet
Mr. Gracey?
Very nice to meet you ,
Mr. Gracey.
And this is our daughter, Megan ,
and our son , MichaeI .
You have very beautifuI
chiIdren , Ms. Evers.
I kicked in
some chromosomes, too.
ChiIdren .
Madam .
Oh . Nice.
Okay.
Thank you .
The master was very pIeased
when he heard you couId come
on such short notice.
NormaIIy we wouId not have
caIIed you here so abruptIy.
But we had no other choice.
What do you got,
termites or something?
Big house Iike this must have
a Iot of termites.
No. But IateIy there have been
more. . .disturbances.
What do you think
of the house, Ms. Evers?
Oh .
I think it's
absoIuteIy incredibIe.
The ItaIian infIuence.
The Renaissance styIe
of the moIding .
The attention to detaiI
is stunning .
You never see houses Iike this.
Or at Ieast I don't.
Great care and Iove went into
the buiIding of this mansion .
This house is my inheritance.
My birthright.
But IateIy it's become
too much to bear.
TeII me, Mr. Evers.
Do you beIieve in ghosts?
Ghosts?
Yeah . Sure.
I beIieve in ghosts. Yeah .
I don't think it's a good idea
to put that on the Iisting .
You shouId taIk about how many
bathrooms are in the house.
PeopIe Iove bathrooms.
We shouId pIay up the toiIet
angIe and Ieave out ghosts.
I think that'd be best.
The storm has swoIIen the river.
How's that?
The storm has fIooded the road .
I'm afraid there wiII be
no Ieaving the mansion tonight.
What?
Of course you are aII more than
weIcome to spend the night here.
Oh , no.
I reaIIy don't think we shouId .
We've got pIans.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
RamsIey wiII show you
to your rooms.
I beIieve the chiIdren wiII be
comfortabIe in this room .
Yeah .
ReaI homey.
You'II be fine.
Wow.
Hey, Iisten .
When you fIush the toiIet, check
and see how quickIy it refiIIs.
Good night, Dad .
Good night.
I hope you and the madame wiII
find this room to your Iiking .
Yeah .
It's great.
It'II be Iike spending the night
in a fine hoteI .
WiII there be anything eIse
that you require, sir?
Are you gonna get us
some chocoIates?
Pardon?
You know, the IittIe chocoIates
they put on the hoteI piIIows.
Sometimes they have chocoIates
on the piIIow.
They have IittIe chocoIates
on the piIIows. . .
to have.
What's the probIem?
SARA:
In the first pIace,
we weren't even supposed to
be here.
We were supposed to be
at the Iake.
What am I supposed to do,
controI the weather now, Sara?
That's not the point.
You couIdn't resist.
You just had to come.
Excuse me. This is a big
opportunity for aII of us.
Not for us, for you .
The onIy thing you seem to care
about anymore is work.
Oh , but when I'm working hard ,
it doesn't matter
as Iong as I'm bringing you
home expensive gifts, right?
Hey, what are you . . .
Hey, Sara.
Hey, Sara, I didn't
mean to say that, okay?
Sara.
Come on .
Stop it.
Sara.
Sara.
I'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, pIease?
Aah !
Ooh .
You scared me.
-Pardon the intrusion , sir.
-Yes.
The master was wondering
if he might have a word with you
in the Iibrary.
A word? Okay. I'd Iove to have
a word with him .
Sure.
Let's go taIk some turkey.
Yes. Turkey.
-Very good , sir.
-Yeah .
If you wiII kindIy foIIow me.
Yeah . Of course.
Of course.
Hey, Sara, I'm gonna have a word
with Mr. Gracey.
I'II be back in a minute.
RamsIey, I was just wondering .
Have you ever been
to a tanning saIon?
I've got a friend who's got
a reaIIy great pIace.
You can get a reaIIy smooth tan .
Do something about
that ashy white Iook.
I'm sure the Iadies
wouId Iove it.
Yes.
Sounds wonderfuI .
WouId you care for a drink, sir,
whiIe you're waiting?
Yeah . Don't mind if I do.
Thank you , RamsIey.
Oh , wow!
Now, that's cIass.
That's what I need to do.
Get a big picture of myseIf
to put on the Iiving room waII .
Adds a touch of eIegance
to the room .
Yes, sir.
Very eIegant.
Thank you .
Thank you so much , RamsIey.
Mmm .
So, RamsIey, how Iong
you been a butIer?
A Iong time.
What are the most
important quaIifications
in case I might be doing
some interviewing?
Attending to every detaiI .
Understanding priorities.
And above aII ,
knowing one's pIace.
What does your boss Iike to do?
What's he into?
You know, what fIoats his boat?
The master Iikes
a great many things.
Art, Iiterature, beauty.
And aII that stuff about ghosts.
Did he get, Iike, a bad cIam
in his jambaIaya one night?
You don't beIieve
in ghosts, sir?
AbsoIuteIy not.
Let me teII you something .
The way I see it, you onIy go
around the track once.
So you do it fuII-out
aII the way around .
Mr. Evers, may I confide in you?
PIease do.
The master is not weII .
He must Ieave this house,
Mr. Evers.
He must move on .
It is of the gravest importance,
I assure you .
Or I fear the very worst.
MEGAN :
I can't beIieve this.
StiII no reception .
We had to take
that IittIe detour.
20 minutes tops.
Yeah , right.
Do you think it's gonna stop
raining soon?
How shouId I know?
I'm not the weatherman .
Hmm .
Stogies.
Not bad .
Not at aII .
HoId onto that.
Hmm .
Hmm .
WonderfuI .
Must be nice.
Must be reaIIy nice.
I teII ya.
Ahh .
Hmm .
[ British accent ]
HeIIo there, good man .
RamsIey,
fix the gentIeman a drink.
NigeI , I just recentIy returned
from the Continent,
where I found
the most interesting book.
Yes, it was caIIed
''Raising the Dead .''
[ NormaI voice ]
Oh ! Oh , cripes.
Oh .
I hope that doesn't stain .
Oh .
Wow.
Interesting .
Wow.
Wow.
I wonder where this Ieads to.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, open this back up!
Hey, open up!
RamsIey!
[ Pounding ]
RamsIey!
Push back the head !
Hey, wiII somebody push
the head back?
[ Music pIays ]
Megan !
What do you think it is?
It's a ghost baII .
I think it wants us
to foIIow it.
I think you're crazy.
It does.
It wants us to foIIow it.
Hey, Megan , wait up!
Where's that scary aIbino
when you need him?
Oh .
HeIIo.
Have you seen my husband?
Excuse me.
Wait!
Wait!
Oh , RamsIey.
It's you .
May I heIp you?
Yes.
I was just Iooking
for my husband .
Ah , indeed .
I Ieft him in the Iibrary.
Right through there.
Honey, it's Iate.
Let's not fight anymore.
Come to bed?
Oh !
I'm sorry.
I thought you were my husband .
Can I heIp you with that?
RamsIey hates it
when I Ieave things Iying about.
Yes.
He seems a bit proper.
He strikes most peopIe that way.
Once you get to know him ,
you'II find that's not the case.
But he's reaIIy. . .
He's reaIIy very sweet.
Thank you .
He's been Iike a father to me.
Mr. Gracey,
may I ask you something?
Yes. Of course.
Anything .
This house.
It's been in your famiIy
for generations.
It's your home.
Why do you want to seII it?
These waIIs are fiIIed
with so many memories.
Some of them painfuI .
I think for you to understand ,
I reaIIy must show you .
It's aII right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
AIthough it might be
a bit worn and faded
from its originaI grandeur,
this house was once fiIIed
with so many things.
So much Iife.
With grand parties, dancing ,
Iaughter, and , above aII , hope.
Being a Gracey meant
that you were denied nothing .
The worId was yours.
What happened here, Mr. Gracey?
She did .
Who?
EIizabeth .
Hers is the story
that haunts these waIIs.
Come on .
Megan , wait.
You don't know the Iast time
that thing's been inspected .
WouId you just reIax?
Where's your sense of adventure?
This is against
aII my better judgment.
[ Thunder crashes ]
Hi !
Is anyone home?
[ Creaking ]
Those must be termites.
Some big-ass termites.
That's aII .
[ CIears throat ]
[ TeIephone ringing ]
HeIIo?
-[ Squawking ]
-Oh !
[ Laughing ]
Oh .
Aah ! Aah !
Megan !
Mom .
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!
This is unspeakabIe!
UnspeakabIe! You have to Ieave!
-Who is that?
-That's none of your business.
Now, come on . Get out of here.
It's way past your bedtime.
Her name was EIizabeth .
Are you kids hungry?
Does anybody want a cookie?
Cookies?!
Don't offer them cookies!
They're trespassers!
Trespassers don't get cookies!
This is none of their concern .
It is their concern !
They're invoIved !
[ Creaking ]
Hide! Hide!
The chiIdren are not
in their room .
Have you seen them?
ChiIdren?
What chiIdren?
What chiIdren?
Her chiIdren .
The chiIdren
she wasn't supposed to bring .
AIong with that brainIess
husband of hers.
Thank you .
If I had to Iisten
to another word
from that insufferabIe fooI ,
I think I wouId have burst.
Of course, sir.
What a fooI !
Did I not teII her
to come aIone?
Is it reaIIy too much to ask
for a IittIe cooperation?
A IittIe order?
Of course not, sir.
If you find the chiIdren ,
bring them to me.
-CertainIy, sir.
-Yes, sir.
The finaI arrangements
have been made.
Nothing further wiII interfere
with the master's pIan .
[ Thunder crashes ]
[ Woman taIking indistinctIy ]
Thank God I heard your voice.
I Iost my way.
I don't know how to get out
of here.
I'm sorry if I sound
a IittIe frazzIed .
I just had myseIf
a IittIe freak show back there.
WOMAN :
It's time to respond .
I was supposed to meet
with Mr. Gracey.
But I got stuck in the waII .
GobIins and ghouIies
from Iast HaIIoween ,
awaken the spirits
with your tambourine.
Okay, I hear you , but I don't
see you . Where are you?
I am Madame Leota, seer of aII ,
voice to the spirits.
Whom do you seek?
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Iet me out of here!
SiIence!
Whom do you seek?
I am seeking a way out of here.
Then you must Iook within .
I don't want to Iook within .
I want to Iook without.
There is great eviI
in this house.
A deviI's curse.
It seeks to destroy you .
Why wouId something seek
to destroy me?
I'm just here to seII the house.
Dark spirits from the grave,
come forth .
Lift us from the bIack
and show us.
Show us the way back.
Dark spirits?
Hey, no dark spirits.
Don't you make no dark spirits
come out.
Lift us.
Lift us up to the Iight.
And Iead us through
this stormy night.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!
Hey, I'd reaIIy Iike to stay
on the ground .
I'd rather stay on the ground .
Can I stay on the ground?
EviI and darkness have faIIen
this night.
But now to survive,
you must gain new sight.
I must first gain new underwear.
OnIy the Iight wiII Iead
the way.
FoIIow it and find
your way home.
There's no pIace Iike home.
There's no pIace Iike home.
Go, Mr. Evers.
Your famiIy is at stake.
Your very Iife is at stake.
Break the curse.
There is no escape for you
unIess you Iift this speII .
Go.
Save yourseIf.
Save your famiIy.
ReIease her.
ReIease us aII !
I'm getting so queasy.
I'm getting very queasy.
[ Laughing ]
Oh !
Aah ! Aah !
[ Instruments pIaying ]
Aah ! Aah !
Aah !
Oh !
[ Crashing ]
[ Tambourine rattIing ,
SiIence ]
-Dad !
-Dad !
Hey!
MichaeI and Megan , you okay?
We're fine, thanks.
Get your things.
Let's get out of here.
We have a probIem .
Because of the rain?
We're gonna get a IittIe wet.
Let's just find your mom
and get out of here.
I'm afraid that's not possibIe.
She can't Ieave.
And why not?
Because she can't!
If I couId teII you , I wouId .
But I can't, so I won't, okay?
Hey, how'd you . . .
Hey, Iook.
Come on .
Daddy's having
more haIIucinations. Let's go.
-They're ghosts, Dad .
-They're not ghosts.
We're just having haIIucinations
from that dinner we ate.
It was that chicken .
It didn't taste right.
-Oh !
-It's not the chicken !
AII right. It's not the chicken .
But we're getting out of here.
But we have to heIp them .
You can't heIp the dead , honey.
They're beyond heIp.
The man's taIking sense.
Everyone shouId keep their noses
in their own business.
But we have to heIp them
break the curse.
Why is everybody taIking
about a curse?
Have you been taIking
to that crazy green gypsy
in the giant paperweight?
We've got to go back to see her.
-No back. I'm not going back.
-But, Dad !
They had me fIoating
aII around the room .
Hey, I was strapped to a chair,
fIoating around the room
with a marching band chasing me.
I'm not going back anywhere!
Forget it, Casper!
But Mom's in troubIe.
What kind of troubIe?
GRACE Y:
She died here in this house.
She was so very young .
So very beautifuI .
She was in Iove with the heir
to this mansion .
Your grandfather.
And he Ioved her
more than Iife itseIf.
But they were from different
worIds and couIdn't be together.
[ Thunder rumbIes ]
How did she die, Mr. Gracey?
She took her own Iife.
Poison .
After that,
his Iife became unbearabIe.
And so, without hope,
without Iove,
without EIizabeth ,
he hung himseIf.
His souI wanders these haIIs,
waiting for her to return .
If you Iisten carefuIIy,
you can stiII hear the beating
of his broken heart.
[ Heart beating ]
Wait a minute.
HoId it a second .
You're teIIing me
this guy is dead
and the reason
we were brought here
is he wants to try to get jiggy
with my wife?
Pretty much .
Are you upset?
The guy is dead , and he's
trying to get with my wife!
And the house isn't reaIIy
for saIe!
Yes, I'm upset!
Oh , Madame Leota, is it her?
Is she truIy our dear, departed
EIizabeth come back to us?
It is true.
She waIks these haIIs.
You see?
I toId you it is her!
But do not be deceived .
AII things are not
as they appear.
For the curse to be Iifted ,
the truth must be known .
And for the truth to be known ,
you must find the key.
What are you taIking about,
baII Iady? What key?
Enter the tomb
under the great dead oak
and traveI down deep
under the ground .
And there you wiII find the key
that must be found .
Find the bIack crypt
that bears no name,
or soon your fate wiII be
the same.
You're teIIing me aII I have to
do is find this key,
then I'm gonna waIk out of here
with my wife and kids?
The key is the answer to aII .
WeII , great. I'm in .
Let's get this key.
There's onIy one probIem .
How do we get out of here?
Yeah , how do we get out of here?
WeII , there's aIways, uh ,
my way.
Hey! I thought you said
you couId drive this thing !
Don't you worry.
I know exactIy what I'm doing .
-Aah !
-Aah !
WeII , you better just keep
your eyes on the road !
-Move over!
-What are you doing?
If you keep driving ,
you'II kiII us aII !
That's where you're wrong .
Because some of us
are aIready dead !
[ Laughs ]
[ Neighing ]
Dad , Iook.
Ready?
Fire!
Dad?
Yes, son?
I see dead peopIe.
Excuse me.
Why are aII these ghosts
stiII hanging around here?
When they died ,
they couIdn't find the Iight.
And now. . .
Now they're trapped .
Doomed to wander the Earth
for aII eternity.
Nice.
Nice job.
Whoa!
[ Horse whinnies ]
Okay.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Can they see us?
No.
Of course not.
Yes, I can . I'm Iooking at you
right now in your stupid hat.
Don't Iisten to him .
He's Iying .
Whatever. Come on , kids.
Let's go. Come on .
I couId swear he was Iooking
right at me.
He's psychic.
This was to have been
her wedding dress.
Oh , it's IoveIy.
It wouId have been IoveIier if
she'd had a chance to wear it.
Now it serves
onIy as a dark reminder
of what couId have been .
To Iove someone so much
and then Iose them so suddenIy.
I can't imagine how awfuI
that must be.
If you truIy Iove someone,
they never Ieave you .
They remain in your heart
forever.
MEGAN :
Isn't that romantic?
He was wiIIing to throw
everything away for Iove.
WeII , now he's broke, dead ,
and cursed . Nice move.
-[ Squishing ]
-Oh , crap!
These are my new shoes.
Hey, kids, watch your step.
-[ Squishing ]
-Oh , crap!
Hey, MichaeI , don't say ''crap.''
AII right.
Where is this pIace?
Okay, where are we?
I think the gypsy Iady
said something
about making a Ieft at an oak.
Okay.
WeII , gIad she was so specific.
[ AnimaI screeches ]
[ Singing in distance ]
What is that?
Do you hear that?
-Yeah .
-Yeah .
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you .
But we were wondering
if you happen to know
where the mausoIeum was.
No, no. I think they said
it was an oId oak.
That's what they said .
It's by the. . .
Yeah . You sound reaIIy good .
Your harmony's tight.
But we're trying to find
my wife. She'II be. . .
Listen , guys.
I'm trying to find a key.
I'm trying to find a key. . .
The key that I'm trying to find
is in the mausoIeum .
The key is in the mausoIeum .
Dad , there it is!
Okay.
We made it.
AII right, kids.
Stay cIose.
[ Bird squawking ]
Hey.
Look.
It's a warning .
Now, how do you know that?
I studied Latin
for three years, Dad .
You thought it was dumb,
remember?
You said it was a dead Ianguage.
Oh , we see how wrong I was
about that.
''Beware aII who enter.
Here Iies the passage
to the dead .''
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?
-I don't Iike Latin .
-Hey, wait. MichaeI .
You're 1 0 years oId now.
You got to start being a man .
I just turned 1 0.
I'm stiII getting used to it.
Okay.
Here's what we do.
Megan , stay here
with your brother.
What?
I'm not gonna Ieave him
out here by himseIf.
You guys stay together.
I'II go in here,
and I'II take care of this.
Okay.
AII right.
Okay.
Oh .
Wow.
Okay.
AII right.
Okay.
I'II be right back.
20 minutes tops, right?
20 minutes tops.
[ Muttering ]
What was it that gypsy
toId me to Iook for?
Look for a crypt with . . .
Look for a crypt. . .
-A crypt without a name.
-Aah !
Oh !
What's the matter with you?
You can't just be popping out
Iike that.
I thought I toId you
to wait with MichaeI .
I was worried
you wouIdn't find it.
Besides, MichaeI's fine.
She said , ''Find the bIack crypt
with no name,
or soon your fate wiII be
the same.''
That must be it.
Good hunch , Dad .
I'm officiaIIy starting
to get sick of this pIace.
And we're here 'cause of who?
Because I take seriousIy my
responsibiIity as breadwinner.
I want you guys to have
everything I never had before.
I didn't know you had
a bad chiIdhood .
I didn't have a bad chiIdhood .
Then why do we have to have
what you didn't have?
Because. . .
Hey, don't be tricking me,
you IittIe Latin-speaking
1 3-year-oId .
Let's just get this over with .
HoId this.
HoId it with two hands, now.
Aah ! Phew!
Oh , man .
Excuse me one second .
I'm sorry to bother you .
Oh !
Aah . Ugh .
Oh , no.
Ew.
Aah .
Okay.
AII right.
Now, that wasn't hard , was it?
Let's get out of here.
That gypsy had me thinking
it was gonna be hard .
-That was easy.
-[ RumbIing ]
[ Roaring ]
Oh ! Oh !
Oh , no.
Oh ! Oh , no!
Go get the key!
I'II take care of him !
Hey, man , go on back to bed .
Get back in your bed .
Go back to bed .
I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers ReaI Estate.
Hey, Iook,
I don't want no troubIe, man .
The gypsy toId me it was
aII right to get the key, so --
Oh !
Just Iighten up.
Now, Iet me teII you something .
I got to get my wife.
I don't want no troubIe.
SeriousIy, back up!
You asked for it.
Next time you're gonna
think twice
before coming back
from the dead , ain't you?
-Did you get the key?
-I'm Iooking ! I'm Iooking !
Take your time. ReIax.
I have everything under controI .
I have everything
compIeteIy under controI .
[ RumbIing ]
Megan , you better Iook faster!
Oh , I don't want to do this.
Jeez.
[ Screeching ]
Aah !
-Aah !

Give me your hand .
Okay.
Come on , come on , come on !
Come on , guys!
Hurry up!
HoId on !
Come on , guys!
Hurry up!
MichaeI !

MichaeI , open the door.
Open the door. MichaeI !
Dad , there's spiders everywhere,
and I don't have a magazine.
-Hey, MichaeI , are you scared?
-Uh-huh .
MichaeI , it's okay to be scared .
Everybody gets scared sometimes.
-Daddy's scared right now.
-You are?
Yes, I'm very scared .
Now, pIease open the door, son !
MichaeI , open the door,
or I'II kiII you !
That's great.
Keep him caIm .
Hey, MichaeI , Iisten ,
it's okay to get scared .
Everybody gets scared
now and then .
You just can't Iet it stop you .
MichaeI , if you think
you're scared now,

What zombies?
MichaeI !
Hey, MichaeI , Iook.
Just open the door.
PIease, man .
Open the door right now.
Dad , they're coming !
[ Screaming ]
MichaeI , open the door

Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door right now!
Open the door!
Oh !
Aah !
Lock it! Lock it!
Okay.
Come on !
AII right.
Okay. AII right.
Get 'em off!
Okay. Come on .
Get 'em off. Okay.
AII right. We got it.
AII right. You okay?
Okay.
My brave IittIe man .
AII right.
AII right.
You okay?
Yeah .
You got the key?
Oh , no.
Wait. Whoa.
Yeah , I got it. I got it.
There it is.
Okay.
AII right.
Now, we went to heII and back
to get this thing .
Where's the door out of here?
First, you must find the trunk.
Trunk?
Yes, trunk.
Not door?
No. Not door.
Trunk.
AII you said I had to do was
find this key! I got the key.
Now you're teIIing me this story
about a trunk!
The key is the answer to aII ,
remember?
Look, I don't make the ruIes.
I just work here.
Okay. That's it.
That's the Iast straw.
I've had enough
of this nonsense.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Put me down !
This is bad Iuck!
This is very bad Iuck!
I'II show you bad Iuck.
I'm tired of pIaying around .
I'm getting nauseous!
You'II get over it.
PIease don't drop me.
I'm fragiIe.
I'm very fragiIe.
Don't taIk to me
about being fragiIe.
I'm the one that's feeIing
fragiIe right now.
Is that it?
-That's it.
-Hmm . AII right.
Now we're in business.
Hey, hoId her for a second .
AII right.
Okay.
Okay.
How do I know what to Iook for?
This thing is fuII of junk.
Find the thing that must be read
Iest your heart be fiIIed
with dread .
There's nothing in here red .
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a Ietter here.
It's a Ietter.
''Yes, my dear heart,
I wiII marry you .
I wiII Iove you
for aII eternity.
And tonight at Iast,
we wiII be together.
I do.
Forever yours, EIizabeth .''
She didn't kiII herseIf.
She wanted to be with him .
Yeah , and somebody gave him
the wrong Ietter.
RAMSLE Y: Yes.
WeII done, Mr. Evers.
I must say I'm impressed .
You are more persistent
than I wouId have ever imagined .
The butIer did it?
You got to be kidding me.
I wiII deaI with you two Iater.
Why'd you kiII her?
Because the master
wouId not Iisten to reason .
He had everything in the worId .
And yet he was wiIIing
to throw it aII away for Iove.
I did teII him
it wouId end badIy.
You're a reaI coId dude.
No, Mr. Evers.
I am a rationaI man .
It was my responsibiIity
to the house.
My duty, sir, to see to it
that the boy did not make
a fooIish error in judgment.
Running away with that girI
wouId have destroyed this house.
It wouId have destroyed
everything .
And I couId not stand by
and watch it aII faII to ruin .
Punch his face in , Dad .
Yeah , but first I'm gonna teII
his master what reaIIy happened .
The master must never know.
Edward and his Iove
wiII be reunited ,
and this curse wiII be broken .
That's not her.
That's my wife.
And what she sees in you
I'II never know.
But that is
of IittIe importance now.
The onIy thing that matters is
that the master's pain must end .
And it wiII end tonight.
The curse wiII be broken ,
and we can aII finaIIy move on .
AII right. That's it, man .
Where's my wife?
Getting ready for her wedding ,
of course.
What wedding?
He can't marry her.
He's dead , and she's not.
True.
But that can be
easiIy corrected .
Life, I'm afraid ,
is such a deIicate state.
If you put one finger on
my wife, I swear I'II kiII you .
How wonderfuI .
You're going to kiII a ghost.
-Leave him aIone!
-Stop it!
-Aah !
-Aah !
Let them go!
[ MuffIed screams ]
You're gonna Iet my kids out
of here, take me to my wife,
and Iet us out of here
right now!
You want out, fine.
Let me show you out.
Now, for the Iast time,
good night, Mr. Evers.
Aah !
Ugh !
[ Car aIarm sounds,
horn honking ]
Oh !
This house has waited so Iong
to have its shroud
of darkness Iifted .
And tonight, for the first time
in , oh , so many years,
I beIieve it may be possibIe
that the story wiII finaIIy end
differentIy.
Sara?
Do you beIieve that Iove
is about second chances?
About forgiveness?
Yes, I do.
Don't you remember?
Remember?
Mr. Gracey, are you aII right?
Don't you recognize me at aII?
Mr. Gracey.
I thought certainIy bringing you
back to Gracey Manor
wouId heIp you remember.
Remember what?
Mr. Gracey, you're scaring me.
Where it happened .
Where we spent
our Iast moments together.
Where we danced together
for the Iast time before you . . .
Before you kiIIed yourseIf!
But now you've returned to me.
And at Iong Iast,
we can be together.
Why do you not remember?
You were my worId , my Iife!
And I have Ioved you in death
as I did in Iife!
Let me go!
Why do you not remember?
You are her.
You are EIizabeth .
You must be!
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart.
I am your one true Iove.
And now we can finaIIy
be together.
Don't you understand?
EIizabeth ,
you must Iisten to me.
I'm not EIizabeth !
PIease!
I impIore you .
Leave me aIone!
Get away from me!
She doesn't remember.
It can't be her.
It is her, sir.
The gypsy woman
prophesied her return .
And now the time has come.
You had best get ready.
But she doesn't remember.
In time she wiII , sir.
I assure you she wiII .
Open up!
Hey!
Let me in !
Aah !
Oh , RamsIey,
you have to heIp me.
There's something
horribIy wrong . Mr. Gracey. . .
Yes. I know, my dear.
I know.
He's expecting you .
He's aIways been expecting you .
And you haven't put on
your dress yet.
We can't keep
the master waiting .
Waiting?
For what?
Why, your wedding , of course.
My. . .
I'm not EIizabeth !
Of course you are, my dear.
You may not see it yet.
But in time you wiII .
You don't actuaIIy think I'm
going through with this madness?
Oh , yes.
I very much do.
You see. . .
we wouIdn't want anything
to happen to the chiIdren .
Now, wouId we?
MichaeI !
Megan !
You wouIdn't.
Of course not, my dear.
But that is entireIy up to you .
If not, I reaIIy do fear
for the chiIdren .
Have her ready.
And this time, any further acts
of insubordination
wiII be deaIt with
in the harshest possibIe manner.
But, sir?
There are worse things
than purgatory, madam .
I can assure you .
Have her ready.
[ Wagner's ''BridaI Chorus'' pIays
off-key ]
Tears of joy.
What are you doing?
Hey, you Ieave me aIone.
Just get out of here
and Ieave me aIone.
Oh , I see.
You're just gonna sit there,
feeIing sorry for yourseIf.
You teII me why not.
This whoIe thing was my fauIt.
We shouId've never been here
in the first pIace.
Supposed to be at the Iake.
We'd be sitting by a warm fire
right now.
And I made us come here.
And now it's too Iate.
No.
It's never too Iate.
Hey, Iook, I tried to get in
there, and I can't, aII right?
I tried !
I faiIed !
You try.
You faiI .
You try.
You faiI .
But the onIy true faiIure
is when you stop trying .
What do you want me to do?
Huh?
Try again .
HoId on !
With what?
-Aah !
-Aah !
EIizabeth?
Yes, my Iove.
I'II be right back.
Okay.
I'II wait here.
DearIy beIoved ,
we are gathered together here
in the sight of God
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of hoIy matrimony.
Dad !
HeIp us!
MichaeI !
Megan !
WiIt thou , Edward Gracey,
have this woman to be
thy wedded wife,
to Iive together
after God's ordinance
in the hoIiest state
of matrimony?
I wiII .
And do you , EIizabeth Henshaw,
take this man to be
your IawfuI husband ,
to Iove and cherish in death
as you did in Iife?
I do.
Whoa!
Aah !
From this day forward , you
shaII be joined together as one
for aII eternity
untiI the very end of time.
[ Speaking Latin ]
What God has joined together
Iet no man cast asunder.
-Dad !
-Dad !
If anyone has any objections. . .
Yeah , I got a few objections!
The next time I say
we're going to the Iake,
-we're going to the Iake.
-Let's go.
Get away from her.
I Iost her once.
I don't intend
to Iet it happen again .
This is not EIizabeth .
RamsIey, you teII him the truth .
I don't know
what you're taIking about.
Now you got amnesia, huh?
EIizabeth didn't kiII herseIf.
He did it.
He's been Iying to you
aII aIong .
I'm warning you , sir.
Step away.
Don't think 'cause
you puII out your sword
I'm gonna Iet you marry my wife.
My patience is wearing thin .
EIizabeth , pIease, come aIong .
I'm not EIizabeth .
You must be.
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.
RamsIey wants you to think
she's EIizabeth
so this curse wouId be Iifted .
That is absurd .
Forgive me.
If you're gonna kiII me,
kiII me.
But on the other side,
I'm gonna be whipping your ass
for aII eternity.
So maybe you shouId read this
before you stab somebody.
-What is it?
-It's EIizabeth's Ietter.
Her reaI Ietter.
The one she wrote.
The one he stoIe.
You never saw it.
What's the meaning of this?
Must we continue to Iisten
to the rambIings of a Iunatic?
But it is written in her hand .
Yeah , it's written in her hand .
ExpIain that, RamsIey.
WeII?
Your union was unacceptabIe.
I tried to warn you ,
but you wouIdn't Iisten .
So you kiIIed her.
I toId you it wouId be a mistake
to run away with that girI .
But I Ioved her!
Was Iove my mistake?
Yes!
I tried to protect you .
AII these years
I've sacrificed for you .
But what wouId you understand
of sacrifice, duty, or honor?
You Ioved her.
WeII , damn you .
Damn you aII to heII !

Mom , what's wrong?
Are you aII right?
-Mom .
-Hey!
Hey, Sara.
Sara, what's the matter?

What's wrong?
It's the poison !
Oh , no.
No.

Hey, get away from us!

No, Dad .
