I think the neighbors have left.
It should be very peaceful here.
It's wonderful
that there's no phone.
When I'm here,
I feeI I can spend...
hours and hours without moving.
Won't you go to the beach?
Yes, to swim.
But it's not a place
I like to stay.
For reading or working,
it's better here.
I prefer the beach.
You'll be disappointed.
I want to go to the beach.
I haven't been this year.
What about in Spain?
We swam, then we'd leave.
We changed place every day.
Sounds great!
At least you had variety?
We never stayed Iong enough.
I was with my parents,
so I couldn't have any fun.
Your trip wasn't fun?
Interesting, but not fun.
What do you call fun?
First of all,
being with kids my own age.
You don't know any here.
I'II meet some.
Most have left by now.
No, well, I hope not.
It's no fun going on hoIiday
with your parents...
even if they're nice.
I've always made friends
on holiday, except this year.
Boys or girls?
Both.
Which do you want to meet here?
Both.
-You'd prefer boys?
-Not especially.
You'd like to find a boyfriend?
Just a friend.
A friend?
Come here.
Tell me...
have you ever been in love?
I'm sure you have been.
There must've been a kid
in school...
whom you said you'd marry
when you grew up.
Sure, when I was very little.
-Since then?
-Nothing.
Let's say, a few boys have...
impressed me.
Well, then?
That's all.
What happened? You must have
impressed them, too?
Maybe...
It's mostly peopIe
I saw only for a moment.
So I don't know.
What do you mean?
Like last year...
in ItaIy, I was in a restaurant
and a boy at the next table...
kept looking at me. I mean,
we both looked and smilled.
Then he left.
A boy your age?
A bit older, about 16 or 17.
I was 14 last year.
Was he Italian?
No, French.
Then you can see him again!
Maybe. The car
had Paris license plates.
So you expect to run into him
on the street?
I doubt it!
If you saw him,
what wouId happen?
I don't know.
-Would you dare speak to him?
-No!
Would he dare?
Maybe...but he doesn't
really interest me.
There's very little chance
we'll ever meet.
I pictured meeting him again,
but I didn't believe in it.
Now it's too late.
It's probably better
if I don't see him.
I see...
In fact, you'd like to meet
someone who didn't leave.
Not at all! You're pretending
not to understand.
No, maybe I'm too old.
No, you're not.
You even seem to be my age.
I can't believe
you've been married.
Neither can I.
Maybe I wasn't really.
I mean...
I never believed in it,
deep down.
That's why it failed.
It's cold!
That's Pierre!
Who?
Pierre. A very old friend.
I haven't seen him since...
before I got married.
What a surprise!
Yes, it is.
Do you know my cousin Pauline?
No, she's never
been here before.
You haven't been here
for at Ieast five years.
Precisely! What a memory!
Well, I'm back.
I come every year.
Have you been here Iong?
We just arrived.
I have the use of the house.
My brother went back to Paris.
I see him now and then.
He says you work very hard.
I spent all of August
preparing my collection.
So now, I've come here to rest.
Have you finished schooI?
Yes and no.
I'm doing graduate work.
Are you here alone?
Yes, until school starts
with Pauline.
Her parents left her in my care.
So to speak!
And you?
You look like a real expert!
Ever done it?
Never.
I could teach you.
We won't be here long enough.
You could get the feel of it
this year...
and continue next year.
It doesn't take strength...
just balance.
I bet it takes skill!
Hey, Pierre!
Traitor.
You promised to teach me.
You don't need lessons.
Is he a good teacher?
The best.
I recommend him.
Marion...Henri.
My cousin Paullne.
Is it as easy as he says?
No. The other day
he lent me his board...
I found out how hard it was.
You do much harder things.
He rides breakers in a dugout!
Really? Where? In Africa?
The South Pacific, where I live.
I'm an ethnologist.
Here's my daughter.
Meet my daughter, Marie.
Your hair's full of sand!
I was Brittany-wrestling
with Gaelle.
But it's done standing up.
We fell down.
She pushed you?
We both fell.
That's not Brittany wrestllng.
That's Greco-Roman.
What? Reto-no-man?
Greco-Roman.
Go take a shower.
I'll be right along. Hurry!
She's funny.
Are you all free for dinner?
My house is there.
I thought we were going
to a restaurant.
They're no good around here.
OK. We'll help you cook.
Thanks. Want a hand putting
your board away?
No. I'll do it later.
You'll meet us there?
See you. Let's go.
See you later...
Is that it?
She's the one who keeps
my feet on the ground.
I mean that geographically,
in a specific place on the map.
Because of her,
I own real estate! The irony!
My brothers wanted
to sell our villa.
I bought it
for Marie's hollidays.
She lives in Rennes
with her mother.
Wednesday, you'll take me home?
Sure, honey.
Are you in a hurry to leave?
The hollidays are nearly over.
Time goes too fast with you!
With you, too.
That's sweet.
Go to bed, love.
I'll kiss you good night later.
But...
Doesn't your work
pin you to a place?
I spend time in places...
but I don't have
a permanent address.
I'm a nomad.
I go where and when I want...
without asking anyone.
But you don't live alone there?
Yes. The last few years
I've had affairs...
nothing permanent.
My ex-wife needs to identify
herself with a home.
I don't have one.
This house isn't really a home.
It has no furniture.
I can't stand a woman...
who makes me think of her
as furniture.
Glad to hear it!
But that's what she did.
I wanted her to be...
as free as I am,
as light and moveable...
to have no luggage,
physica or mental.
She had a daughter!
So did I!
You didn't take care of her.
Yes, I did. I raised her
the first two years.
She wasn't a burden?
Very little.
-Less than your wife?
-Much less!
Then keep her.
I have no right,
legally, that is.
And a child needs roots.
She can uproot herself later.
Didn't you say you lived alone?
Yes, but...
I'm just waiting.
Waiting for what?
That unpredictable thing
called love.
I've never really
fallen in love...
and I want to.
I let myseIf be misled
by a man...
who convinced me that
he loved me and I loved him.
I believed him.
But it wasn't love.
It was being faithful.
Being faithful
meant a lot to me.
It still does.
I believe that to really love...
you must think
it'll last forever.
But we all make mistakes.
You won't make any more?
I don't know.
But I won't believe
something's love when it isn't.
Love burns.
I want to burn with love.
When it's worth it, I hope.
For whom?
I don't know.
It'll happen, I don't know when,
but quite unexpectedly.
Maybe never.
I hope not. But I'll burn.
But will you know
where to aim your flame?
No. I said it would happen...
quite unexpectedly.
Then you'll make
another mistake.
That's true. I could.
You're free now. Enjoy it.
Don't tie yourself down.
That depends to whom.
Freedom doesn't interest me.
I don't think the way you do.
What bothered me,
if I may say so...
wasn't being attached...
but being attached to someone
I didn't burn for.
I've never burned with love
except in dreams...
as girls do for a movie-star...
a prince, an athlete, a face
glimpsed and never seen again.
But it wasn't love.
I've probably set hearts aflame.
But they belonged to people
I didn't care about...
so I never noticed.
Men may have
killed themselves over me!
I hope not.
If they did, I never found out.
But strange as it may seem,
one thing has never happened...
to spark a love in myself
and in another...
instantly and reciprocally.
But I don't despair.
It'll happen one day...
and suddenly,
I'll go up in flames.
Maybe not suddenly.
Just as well.
Passion that flames too quickly
burns out too fast.
No, it must catch right away,
take you by surprise.
And after that?
After the surprise?
After the surprise,
it's all surprises.
Why worry about ''after''?
Because love, like life,
exists in time.
Yes, but in the present.
You live in an improbable
future, so you don't love.
What? You don't know me!
I do a little.
I can guess...see through you.
So what?
Let me ask you a question.
-I gather you live alone?
-For now.
Do you like it?
No. I'm like Marion, waiting.
To burn with passion?
For a deep and lasting love.
I believe in it,
even if you don't.
Meanwhile, I live.
Live? You live on hope?
Maybe, but I live well.
Better than if I
compromised with someone...
I really didn't love.
I'm in the same boat
you both are.
I lived with a girI.
We stayed together too long...
and a few months ago
had the guts to split up.
And now you're looking for
the ideal woman?
I'd say...
someone I could trust...
even if at first...
Forget it!
-Even if what?
-I've said enough.
Less than I did!
And I! You said the least!
No, I don't think so.
That's right.
Pauline hasn't said a word.
True.
Let's see. Are you waiting, too?
Of course.
You have hopes?
Sure. At my age,
I'd be dumb not to.
Have you ever been in love?
You told me you had been.
I did not. Maybe I made it up.
Then tell us.
We won't hold it against you.
It's not interesting.
Yes, it is.
We talk about it.
Why won't you?
Because I don't feeI like it.
Even if it's interesting to you,
at my age it isn't.
And at our age?
Obviously,
since you talk about it.
Doesn't it interest you?
Yes, I Iearn things.
Then you're not being fair.
we could learn from you.
You don't need to.
You know enough.
She's putting on airs!
Be nice. Answer.
Have you ever been in love?
-With who?
-A boy.
-Your age?
-No, he was old.
How old?
Twelve. I was six.
He was very old for me.
Is that all?
She's putting us on.
I don't agree with any of you,
except maybe Pierre.
Really? What do you think?
I couldn't get all excited
about someone...
without knowing him.
You must know people
to love them.
People?
She always says that.
Boys, then.
To love them or to be friends
with them?
Both. It's the same.
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.
Anyway, I'll never fall in love
with someone I don't know.
How do you know?
What about that boy?
Which one, the 12-year-old?
No, another. It doesn't count.
It was like a dream.
You're right. Love is a dream.
Not entirely.
Her feet are on the ground!
You said love must be shared.
And you want it to happen
right away, at first sight.
People's superficial aspects
don't interest me.
The deeper ones do.
But you sense them underneath.
Love is when,
beneath the surface...
you see in a flash
a person's whole depth.
But you said
one can make mistakes.
That's true.
But what can one do?
She's seeing right into
our souls there!
No. For that I'd have to
be in love.
For the moment,
you're all quite opaque.
Even Pauline.
Let's go dancing?
Where?
There's nowhere to go.
The Casino.
It's awful.
Doesn't matter.
We'll have fun tonight.
I'm going home!
Pierre, don't!
OK, but I warned you.
Isn't it great
that we met again?
I feel younger suddenly.
You haven't changed...
in five years.
Neither have you.
I still love you as much.
So do I.
What's got into you?
Kiss me. You used to before.
Before? Before I got married!
So much has happened since.
You said you hadn't changed.
Physically!
If I'd loved you,
I'd have married you.
You said you'd made a mistake!
With you it wouId have been
a mistake, too!
It's just as well.
Come on.
They'll wonder where we are.
Wait! Listen to me.
You must understand.
If you believe in love
at first sight...
tonight all my old love
resurfaced.
I reailzed no other woman
made and still makes me feel...
like you do.
You're drunk!
If you're my friend,
leave me alone.
I don't want to talk about love.
That's all you talked about
all evening.
In the abstract.
You might as well know.
If I ever love again,
it won't be you.
I can wait.
No, I value you as a friend,
but love can't be forced
You may change your mind.
Why are you so biased
against me?
Listen, stop talking about that.
OK. But I had to get it
off my chest.
Pauline, Pierre wants to
dance with you.
Let's go to my house.
It's on the way.
For one last drink.
Let's go to my place.
Pauline's tired.
OK. I'll follow you.
See you there.
What's that?
I haven't finished it.
Let me see them all.
We're late!
Did you sleep well?
I got up at 11 :30.
No, don't touch it.
I'll show you.
Bring the sail up very slowly.
Careful! Stand behind me.
Very slowly...
Let the sail flap...
cross your hand over,
and hold it like this.
On the sand?
Stand like that.
I'll put my foot there.
I Iean back?
But feeI...the wind filling it.
And my arm?
Try again.
It's very hard.
She's too much!
I've seen worse!
I've got it now.
-It's very hard.
-It's all baIance.
He doesn't know what to do.
Can I show her?
You know how?
Got a board?
I don't llke those things much.
I have a sailboat in GranvilIe.
Your hands aren't
in the right pIace.
Like that. With your hand.
It's really hard.
The wind's against us.
You been here Iong?
We just arrived.
PIace your Iegs right.
Is she your sister?
My cousin. Cute, isn't she?
Who's he?
Pauline, watch
or you'll never Iearn!
Pauline, your turn.
That's all for me.
Coming tomorrow?
Maybe.
See you Iater.
Stand straighter.
Watch for the wind.
Were you waiting? Am I Iate?
I came to see you aIone.
I'd be embarrassed
in front of the others.
Then come in.
I'm ashamed of myseIf.
It never happened
so fast before.
What could be better?
You wanted to go up in fIames!
If it was reciprocaI.
It is.
I doubt it.
I'm onIy your Iatest conquest.
You see things in terms
of ownership and possession.
I don't.
We spent a wonderfuI night
together.
Let's spend more,
as many as you want.
Why? You don't want to?
The Iogistics
are too complicated.
Why? What's stopping us?
Come to my pIace.
Move in.
You'll be more comfortabIe.
And Pauline?
She can come, too.
Marie's Ieaving.
It's a big house.
No. I'd be too embarrassed
to tell her.
What's wrong with her knowing?
I'm responsibIe for her.
Don't be silIy.
She needs a boyfriend.
It's time she Iost her cherry!
All right?
Of course not.
And Pierre's acting so jeaIous!
You toId him?
No, he hasn't a cIue.
He asked me to dinner tonight.
Without me, of course.
I don't mind.
WilI I see you Iater?
No. I'm dining aIone.
I'll stay home and go to bed.
I'm tired.
Pauline needs sIeep, too.
We'll meet tomorrow.
I can't tomorrow.
I'm taking Marie back home.
I won't be back
until Iate afternoon.
Come to my house for dinner.
You come to my house.
It's my turn to invite you.
WilI Pierre be there?
I'm afraid I can't avoid that.
I like him a Iot.
But he's impossibIe.
It's all so complicated.
No, it's very simpIe.
Learn to live for the moment.
It'll make you stronger.
I'm so weak!
Come on.
How did it go?
Pauline, come back!
Have you had breakfast?
Why did you pretend
not to see us yesterday?
Your Henri gets on my nerves.
He's not mine. He's yours.
You introduced us.
He did it himseIf.
I bareIy know him.
We taIked about boats one day.
He knows a Iot.
But he's no friend.
You can't keep him
off the beach.
It's as much his as yours.
Maybe more.
It's in front of his house.
Why swim there? You have a car.
You could go eIsewhere.
I like it there.
I'm not avoiding anyone.
Because...
he's there?
Maybe.
When he comes, I'll Ieave.
So you'll be aIone.
You're out of your mind!
I don't get you.
You want to be free
and you see that guy!
I'm free to see who I want.
He's not interesting.
You're wrong! He is!
Since you insist...
he's more interesting than you.
I hate to say it,
but in all sorts of ways.
Compared to you, no.
Compared to me?
I'll be the judge.
Why are you making a scene?
You promised not to.
I can stand
that you don't Iove me...
but that guy's just
taking you for a ride!
He is not!
He's the one who said it.
He takes them as they come.
You don't mean
more than another.
Listen...
the more you knock him,
the more interesting he gets.
So Iet's drop this
and stay friends, OK?
I say it as a friend:
watch out for him.
Maybe he's dangerous,
but danger fascinates me.
Don't say that!
It's too bad
you're not my friend.
If you were, you could heIp me.
HeIp you how?
To resist this fascination.
Your jeaIousy
makes things worse.
You once could've
prevented me...
from marrying a man
I didn't Iove.
You'd aIready dropped me!
Because you were so jeaIous
and had a girIfriend.
I live aIone.
I can stilI be your friend.
Go after Pauline.
I mean it.
She's just a kid.
You're teaching her windsurfing.
Why not Iove?
I hope you're joking.
Anyway, I don't stand a chance.
She onIy likes guys her age.
Boys her age
are stupid and brutaI.
You'd do her a Iot of good.
I'm not that dedicated.
Are you aIone?
They're out there.
Are they going far?
She's a great swimmer.
She can go for miles.
And you?
I did OK as a junior
at 25 yards!
-Want to swim?
-Not right now.
Then Iet's sit down.
Did you think I'd come?
And you?
I knew you came here.
You came for me?
I wouIdn't waIk 5 miles
just to swim!
Maybe to see Marion.
Are you crazy?
Admit you like her.
Sure, who wouIdn't?
But she's not exactIy my type.
I like more naturaI girIs.
Was that guy her boyfriend?
-Her brother?
-Think so?
I don't know.
They Iook a bit alike.
Anyway...
He's a friend.
She's married
but getting divorced.
It's your big chance!
That chick's not for me!
Do you have a girIfriend?
In Paris.
I was seeing a girI here,
but we had a fight.
You got a guy?
Loads!
So there's room for one more!
Won't be you!
Who said I applied?
I don't like to be touched.
-And all those guys?
-They don't dare.
They're not boyfriends.
Let's go for a swim.
Pauline! Come here!
Gone swimming yet?
We were just going.
I'd go with you,
but I have to go home.
I was in Rennes.
My car's in the garage.
-Marion not here?
-She's with Pierre.
Out there. See?
-Where?
-There.
Ah, yes! Amazing!
We were supposed to meet at six,
but I got back earIy.
I bought this on the way.
I had the tune in my head.
Remember, at the Casino,
they'd destroyed it.
Do you know it?
I'm going home.
If you want, come hear it.
Go on. Don't worry about me.
I have to stop by
the post office.
I'll be back.
If you Ieave,
push the door shut.
There's nothing to steaI,
anyway. Bye.
I like that guy.
Is he your cousin, too?
No. We met the other day.
He picked you up?
He's a paI of Pierre's.
Isn't he your cousin's
boyfriend?
She onIy met him two days ago!
He's more likeIy to get her
than that other guy.
I'm for Pierre.
He's younger and more handsome.
Marion and he
are great together.
That guy's going to get her.
Want to bet?
Anyway, you won't get her.
Hi there.
How's tricks?
Give me some peanuts.
Here. Haven't seen you
in a whlle.
I was away at my brother's
wedding in St. Lo.
I may not stick around.
August was booming,
but now I'm bored.
You're not going swimming?
AIone? Let's go together.
I have to mail this Ietter.
I'm busy Iater.
Tomorrow morning?
I'm not here in the mornings.
We'll do it another day.
Henri, I was Iooking for you.
At my pIace?
You shouId've waited.
No. Do you know what's happening
at your pIace right now?
What? They're dancing.
Dancing? They're in bed!
I don't believe it!
What did you say?
I was so taken aback,
I was speechIess.
Fine. Leave them aIone.
Really!
Upset because of her parents?
No, just myseIf.
She shouIdn't be picking up
idiots on the beach.
But she won't listen to me.
He's no idiot.
They're great together.
That girI's funny.
Candy appIe?
No, thanks.
Then Iet's go.
No, not whlle
they're stilI there.
Here they come.
They didn't have time
to do much!
See you Iater.
WouIdn't it be simpIer
if you moved in?
No, I have to watch Pauline.
I don't want her to bring
just anyone home.
At my pIace
I can throw them out.
It's better if you come
to my house.
For dinner?
Do you mind if I Ieave
at six a.m.?
It's the best time to work.
And that way,
your littIe cousin won't know.
I think she aIready does.
I'm gIad.
The embarrassing thing
is telling her.
Wait.
Are you coming with us tomorrow,
to Mont St. MicheI?
Mont St. MicheI?
Tomorrow? You're joking!
Pauline wants to see it.
She needs something to tell her
parents when she gets back.
Besides her amorous escapades!
No...tourists bring out
the murderer in me!
And your littIe cousin
doesn't seem too fond of me.
I think...
she wanted me to fall in Iove
with Pierre.
Come here!
The girIs went
to Mont St. MicheI.
I just stopped by
in case they hadn't.
I was going sailing, but it was
put off tilI tomorrow.
Come for a swim with us.
OK. I'm coming.
Do you like it?
Come on.
Hey! The girI's coming!
Tell her to hide! Hurry!
Forgive me.
I saw the TV on, so I came up.
Good. I went swimming.
It's chilIy today.
Let's go down.
In that wet toweI?
Right. I'll change.
Wait downstairs?
We're disturbing someone.
Someone?
Too bad for them if you know.
Hurry up. I want to get dressed.
Now you Iend your bed?
I Iend nothing.
I was on the phone,
and they snuck up.
I was chasing them out
when you came.
I was right to be wary
of that kid.
Where's Pauline?
Luckliy, at home. Resting.
Better not tell her. Right?
If that boy tries to see her
again, I wilI!
Don't upset her for nothing.
I hope I'm not disturbing you?
I came now,
since I can't come evenings.
Why not say you won't come!
No, I can't. It's physicaI.
That guy literally repeIs me.
Well, he attracts me.
I Ioathe him. Do you know
what he reminds me of?
A snake.
I'm more like a snake,
with my serpentine figure!
I mean he's not attractive.
He just has you under a spell.
No, I've bewitched him.
Has he scored?
What an ugIy word!
Not the word, the act!
Pierre, pIease.
The answer is yes!
Why go so far to get
what you have right here?
I feeI so cIose to you.
Too cIose!
I don't want someone like me
but someone who compIements me.
You're perfect.
You don't need anyone.
Everyone does.
Love is what allows us
to fuIfilI ourseIves.
Love? SIeeping with a guy
you'll never see again?
That's Iove?
We'll see each other again.
PeopIe in Iove can go
anywhere on earth in two days.
I'll go see him,
or he'll come see me.
I'm not crazy.
I was crazy when I lived with a
guy who followed me like a dog.
You're like a nice dog, too.
Don't be too sure.
If Henri gets away from me...
No matter!
I'll dream of him
while we're apart...
and enjoy being with him
even more.
Better a few intense moments
with him...
than sharing a comfortabIe
life like yours.
I need to feeI exaIted.
ExaIt yourseIf aIone,
with your calling.
Calling?
Your work!
It's in Paris,
not the South Seas.
You're a fIower
that onIy bIooms on home soil.
Next you'll accuse me
of betraying France!
The things jeaIousy
makes you say!
You're into dime-store
exoticism!
Enough of him!
He's forgotten you.
It's your attitude I depIore.
Attitude!
I don't have an attitude!
I Iove a specific man.
You don't.
I Iove him and he Ioves me.
No, he does not Iove you!
You don't know!
No, you can't know.
I tell you I do...
and I can prove it!
VisuaI, physicaI proof!
If onIy I'd had a camera.
What do you mean? When?
Yesterday at his pIace,
while you were away.
He was with the girI
who sells candy.
You saw them?
I was passing behind his vilIa.
She was naked in his room.
Was he there, too?
I doubt she was aIone!
Think I'm making it up?
No, you're not.
It's quite true.
Because I was there.
What?
Luckily, I stopped by
Henri's pIace on my way home.
The girI was there,
but with SyIvain.
So he Iends out his room?
No, we had to chase them out.
I...we went up...
and they hid in the bathroom.
Was Pauline there?
No, she was home.
-Did you tell her?
-It's better not to.
If you'd made a pIay for her,
this wouIdn't have happened!
If you both went for more
interesting guys...
it wouIdn't either.
You both like guys
who don't care.
Henri cares!
See where your snooping Ieads?
Just stop it.
I have nothing more to say.
I'd sworn not to see you again.
I'm Ieaving.
Listen, Pierre.
You're incredibIe!
You want to tell peopIe
what to feeI.
I'd like you so much
if you weren't so jeaIous.
Well, I am.
I am because...
Because I Iove you.
To hell with it. I'm off.
You're Ieaving?
Take Pauline.
She wants to go to the beach.
So you can be with him! Go on!
But don't say
I'm curtailing your freedom.
Pauline, you coming?
Believe me...
she likes you...
a Iot more than you think.
There!
Perfect!
Lean back...against you.
That's it. Perfect.
You can feeI the wind, right?
Let's stop there.
We'll do some more Iater.
We'll get a bite to eat, OK?
There. You're not coId?
You don't want this?
Hi!
Have you seen SyIvain today?
No, I haven't.
Thanks. Bye.
That's OK. Bye.
If he was here, you'd see him.
It's strange. He toId me
he'd be here today for sure.
When did he say it?
Two days ago, yesterday.
I was at Mont St. MicheI.
He was sailing.
The day's not over.
We'll borrow a dinghy.
Look! The sea's IoveIy.
I don't want to.
What is it?
Don't cry just because
some creep stood you up!
He's not like that.
You don't know him,
and he's done you no harm!
Let's buy candy.
Want something?
Some peanuts.
-How much?
-5 francs.
I have the exact amount!
Listen...
You haven't seen SyIvain?
SyIvain? I haven't seen anyone.
I just got here.
See you!
Why ask her?
She doesn't know him.
She'd say anything.
One never knows.
You're acting weird.
You're making fun of me.
No, I'm not.
I was just trying to heIp.
Something's going on.
What did you all tell him
to keep him away?
I never spoke to him.
Not you, Marion, or Henri.
You're imagining things.
She'd do it.
She's turned you against him.
That won't stop me
from seeing him.
She didn't say a word.
All right, she did.
OK, you asked for it.
I have nothing against him.
I don't know him, but my advice
is to watch out for guys...
who cruise around picking up
girIs on every beach.
He's not like that!
How do you know?
And what do you know?
Anyway, goodbye!
Listen, Pauline!
Let go! I don't want to hear
you say nasty things.
Thanks for
the windsurfing Iessons.
I'll Iearn Iater.
Come on, Iet's go eat.
I'm not hungry.
Why do you all criticize me?
I could criticize you,
Marion, Henri, too.
Marion doesn't want you
seeing shady types.
She sees a few herseIf.
Henri's very shady. So are you.
You're all shady and tricky.
SyIvain is on the IeveI.
On the IeveI?
Yes, and you're
a dirty hypocrite!
What if he was with
another girI?
Go ahead, invent some more!
When, now?
Yesterday.
I didn't want to tell you,
but you're being had.
Ask Marion what he was doing
with the candy girI.
He was sailing.
He was taking you for a ride!
Ask Marion.
Let's go.
Not now. We'll disturb her!
Sorry to bother you...
but I've been called a liar.
He says such vile things.
OnIy what I was toId.
What? You didn't tell her...
It's not true?
You didn't say that?
If I toId you, it's because
I thought you could be discreet.
Forgive me.
I didn't want to hurt you,
but you've been had.
You're oId enough
to know the truth.
Why did you tell that story?
Especially to a gossip.
I didn't tell him.
He saw the girI.
He was spying.
That's not true!
I wasn't spying. I passed by.
Sure.
Listen to me.
Nothing happened.
He really cares about you.
Nothing happened between them.
I swear.
She threw herseIf at him,
dragged him into the bathroom.
It's a pity SyIvain isn't here.
His sailing trip
was changed to today.
He had no way of telling you.
It's too bad I didn't see you.
Why don't you mind
your own business?
See what you've done?
Did she find that guy?
Do you care?
You asked me where he was.
I don't give a hoot!
The kid was worried.
They had a date.
ShouIdn't worry about guys.
Is she his sweetheart?
You didn't know?
I don't know him.
Well, vagueIy.
-VagueIy?
-What are you saying?
No, nothing.
Do you know Henri?
His buddy? Maybe.
You a cop?
His fiancé says
she caught you with him.
With Henri or SyIvain?
SyIvain. That's what she said.
I don't care what she says.
So it's true?
Who cares!
OnIy the truth hurts.
Then it's a lie?
None of your business.
I don't know you.
Anyone who gossips about me...
I'll get my fiancé
to beat him up.
I've got a fiancé, two even!
One here and one in America.
They don't Iet peopIe
badmouth me!
But they Iet you chase guys?
Me, chase guys?
You nuts?
I can have as many guys
as I want!
But I onIy like 'em
reaI handsome.
Then you like Henri?
He's not bad. But I never
chased him or anyone eIse.
The girI heard
you were with her guy.
Who the hell toId her that,
the bIonde?
Yes. Is it true or faIse?
FaIse, of course. Can you see me
with that littIe kid?
So you were with Henri?
Quit prying!
That chick made it up!
I wasn't with anyone.
Who were you with
in Henri's room?
I was never in his room!
Who toId you?
Who were you with?
Who toId you?
The girI? How could she know?
I was behind the house.
I saw you.
Bunch of cops! Maybe I was
with Henri. So what?
Do you have to broadcast it?
Think of that poor girI.
I don't want to upset her.
So he toId you to go
into the bathroom...
and pretend you were together.
He said nothing.
I went in there.
So I wouIdn't get caught in bed.
I hate that!
And SyIvain?
He pushed him in.
I didn't know why.
Now I get it!
She saw us through the door.
What could we say?
I was ashamed.
I was bIushing.
I was onIy wearing a toweI, my
swimsuit was drying downstairs.
So he got off scot-free!
I don't like doing
that kind of favor.
I don't like being used.
Is she your sister?
Who? Marion? Well, yes.
I thought so.
You won't tell her?
No. But I'll tell
the young girI.
Her guy'll tell her.
She your sister, too?
No, a cousin...
my cousin, that is.
It's none of my business...
but I'd say
they keep bad company.
They're cute,
especially the oIder one.
Too bad you're her brother.
You'd make a nice coupIe.
Are you free tonight?
Tonight?
It's my Iast day.
I want to ceIebrate.
All my paIs have Ieft,
except my fiancé...
but I see too much of him.
No, thanks, I can't.
On me! I have money.
No, really...
'Cause I'm a peddIer?
You're crazy!
Tonight...I'm...
invited to my cousin's.
Too bad. I'll find someone.
Have a nice time.
Have you seen Pauline?
I think she's at Henri's.
It's not the time to expIain.
I've nothing to expIain.
What did you tell them?
We shut up and you taIk!
I didn't say anything.
Then your chick did?
Pierre did.
That guy?
What does he know?
He was behind the wall, spying.
He saw her in my room.
He saw her with you,
not with me!
He onIy saw her.
Which suits me fine.
Not me! I won't take the rap.
I toId Pauline
the girI hustIed you...
and you turned her down.
You bet you did.
You're a reaI bastard!
We're young, so you use us
to get what you want.
That's disgusting!
Where do they live?
You don't know?
Three miles up in the hllIs.
Go ahead! Be my guest.
Where exactIy?
Well, I know how to get there
by car...Iet's see...
I'm warning you...
by tomorrow, Pauline and Marion
wilI know it all.
Tomorrow's different.
Some things
one must break gentIy...
Did he break it gentIy
to Pauline?
Just because one girI's crying,
why make both cry?
But the wrong one's crying!
It doesn't matter.
I really don't get you!
You've got a fabuIous girI...
and you mess around
with that bimbo?
I guess I'm not prejudiced.
And that bimbo
is a reaI turn-on.
Maybe to oId guys!
Thanks. OK, so I'm oId.
Listen, all my life I've Ioved
and been Ioved.
Now I'm fed up.
I'm resting.
I'm through with passion.
Marion annoys me.
Then don't chase her.
She's chasing me! And one can't
pass up a girI like her!
You don't give a damn?
No, I like her...
I'm even fond of her.
But I hate making peopIe cry.
In fact, I'm too nice.
It really gets me into troubIe.
I hate seeing you so sad.
I shouIdn't have toId Pierre.
I'd rather know.
And I'm not that sad.
I liked SyIvain,
but I wasn't really in Iove.
I didn't like him.
To each his own.
You took the first comer.
What about you?
Let's not argue.
But you could have done better,
even here.
To get some experience.
Do you know who I mean?
He's oId!
He's young and handsome.
Some girIs my age like aduIts.
I don't.
Pierre's very nice to me.
I don't mind him, but...
I wish you wouIdn't taIk
about him like that.
But I'm fIattering him.
He's very attractive.
You take him.
You'd be great together.
Maybe.
But Iove can't be forced.
To me he's a littIe boy.
To me he's oId. As oId as Henri.
But nicer and better Iooking.
You see...
I can't convince you
to Iove him...
and you can't
convince me either.
Everything bad you say
about Henri...
and that I aIready tell myseIf
won't make me drop him.
Like what?
I don't know...
That our Iove is impossibIe.
That I'm mad to fall for someone
who lives so far away...
who Ioves me Iess
than I Iove him.
Even though...
I think he's hooked, despite
his pretended indifference.
I feeI my Iove is so strong...
that I'll make him share it,
if I'm given enough time.
I want to make him really
fall in Iove.
So that if I suffer,
he wilI, too.
Why make him suffer
if you Iove him?
In Iove, one must share
everything...
pIeasure and pain.
You say that Iove
can't be forced...
yet you want to make him
Iove you.
Love me more!
But I'm sure he's more in Iove
than he Iets show.
Who's there?
TeIegram for you.
I have to be in Paris
this afternoon.
I'll come back by train
tomorrow.
I'll drop you at the beach.
Pierre or Henri
wilI bring you back.
I don't want to go.
How are you?
You didn't come today?
Marion had to go to Paris.
She Ieft you aIone?
She could have driven you
to the beach.
I didn't want to see
anyone today.
OK...I'll go.
I wanted to apoIogize
for yesterday.
You were right to tell me.
Your friend must be furious.
Henri must've toId him
you taIked.
You didn't?
No. He showed up
as we were Ieaving.
What? You haven't
taIked to him?
I don't want to see him again.
That's terribIe!
It's Henri
who was with the girI.
Henri? You saw her with SyIvain.
So did Marion.
Henri fooIed us all.
He's diabolicaI!
He pushed your friend
into the bathroom with the girI.
SyIvain agreed to it?
He didn't dare speak up.
I doubt it.
How do you know?
The girI toId me,
and it makes more sense.
Have you seen SyIvain today?
He wasn't at the beach.
Neither was Henri.
Maybe he is now.
Shall we go?
No one.
Let's go to GranvilIe.
He must've gone sailing
with his dad.
Let's check the port.
No. They'd be back by now.
Let's go anyway.
We'll find out.
Do you know where he lives?
Here in GranvilIe.
But I don't know his address.
He doesn't have mine.
There was no need.
We'd meet on the beach.
Shall we go eat?
OK.
What's on your mind?
No one toIerates
other peopIe's choices.
You don't like Marion
with Henri.
She doesn't like SyIvain
with me.
I don't understand Henri
and the girI.
They're the onIy two
I do understand.
Because it suits you.
Suits me, too, but stilI...
When coupIes are well-matched,
then it's OK.
Then SyIvain and I are OK.
We're well-matched.
I've nothing speciaI
against him...
besides what happened
yesterday.
But you can do better
than a kid like that.
Because he's young?
I wasn't like that
at his age.
What were you like?
Tender and romantic.
He's tender, too.
You both fell for the Ieast
interesting guys around!
Not interesting to you,
but to us they are.
Yes. Sure.
How come you decide what others
are to like or dislike?
All right.
Let's say SyIvain's OK.
But not Henri!
She can't Iove him...
or she's insane.
Love's a form of insanity.
No, you Iove what's good
and what's good for you.
There's no mistaking true Iove,
and she did.
She says it herseIf.
She's done it all her life.
What infuriates me
is seeing peopIe...
create their own misery.
If she Ioved
what was good for her...
I'd be the first to approve.
She aIways goes for what is
most remote from her.
Whereas I feeI so cIose.
When I saw her again...
the sense of familiarity
was so strong.
I knew she was for me,
that she was part of me.
That's it. You're too cIose.
She knows you by heart.
You hoId no mystery for her.
You're not strange.
I don't want to be.
I hate anything strange!
When I met her, she Ioved
a strange guy worse than Henri.
I knew it wouIdn't Iast,
that I'd get her eventually.
Then a third guy showed up,
and he got her.
Do you know him?
Her husband?
I met him when I was littIe.
He's not strange.
No, he's ordinary.
She married someone ordinary
but not me.
You missed your chance.
You didn't assert yourseIf.
I hate asserting myseIf.
I want to wait tilI she
comes to me on her own.
So wait.
I'll wait.
For as Iong as it takes.
TilI...she Ioves me.
Or if it's too Iong,
tilI I've stopped Ioving her.
Quite possibIy
I'll stop Ioving her some day.
By then she may Iove me.
But it'll be too Iate.
I'll be even!
In fact, you don't Iove her.
You want her to Iove you.
If you Iove someone,
you want to be Ioved back.
Her not Ioving me
and Ioving Henri...
doesn't make me jeaIous.
It puts her beIow the IeveI
where I can Iove her.
That's so pretentious!
Do you think you're
the center of the universe?
No.
But if she's attracted
to peopIe...
who are the opposite of me...
if she's not made for me,
as I think I'm made for her...
and if the conviction my Iove
is based on is destroyed...
then I stop Ioving her.
It's that simpIe.
You were here?
Hadn't you Ieft?
For where?
We thought you'd gone to Paris
with Marion.
No. Where were you?
We went to the regatta...
I think we all have
important things to say.
My pIace is quieter.
I have to take Pauline home.
It's earIy
and it's on her way.
First she'd like a few words
from you, right?
OK. Come here, Pauline.
I hope you didn't believe
that story...
about SyIvain and the girI.
Marion made it up.
He was with the girI.
Yes, I was. It's all my fauIt.
Kiss and make up.
How could you Iet him
taIk you into it?
It wouId have made troubIe.
Hasn't there been
enough troubIe?
I don't matter!
You're all disgusting.
All of you!
Let's get going.
Let's drink
to our reconciliation.
Are you stilI mad?
Not with you.
With me?
Pour!
With you she is!
Why, I wasn't invoIved.
I hope she forgives you.
Cheers.
You think I'm Machiavellian.
Not at all.
I did it without thinking.
I thought you'd hide
behind the door.
But you didn't.
Sure. Now it's my fauIt.
I hoId nothing against you.
You were free to do anything,
even tell Marion.
Me tell your chick?
I'm not like him, a rat fink!
What?
You're a rat fink,
so shut up!
Who cares about littIe creeps
like you?
Big asshoIes
won't keep me awake nights.
So go to sIeep!
That's enough.
I said we'd all make up.
It was my fauIt, OK?
Now Iet's forget
the whoIe thing.
Right. Let's forget it.
I'm going back to Paris
tomorrow.
I have to get to bed.
Come on, Pauline.
Henri'll take her home!
No way! I brought her.
I'll take her home.
Tell him you're staying!
Answer! You staying?
Watch it, joker!
That's enough!
Fight outside, not in my pIace!
You OK?
Great! She's in no shape
to go home.
We have to wait
tilI she caIms down.
What time is it?
Weren't you due home at eIeven?
Yeah. I'll get
in troubIe again.
Pierre, take him home.
You do it.
He lives near you. It's easier.
I'll take Pauline home Iater.
I brought her.
I'll take her back.
Don't be grotesque!
PIease take SyIvain home.
He'll get in troubIe.
Henri'll take me home.
You mind?
Not at all.
You can spend the night here.
There's Iots of room.
I'll take you both home.
Why? It's twice the distance.
An extra five miles. Coming?
I'm staying here.
What?
I'll sIeep here.
Henri offered it. I accept.
Are you joking?
Not at all.
I don't want to go home.
I'd be afraid
in the house aIone.
No. I have to take you back.
You don't have to do anything.
I'm responsibIe for you.
You're not.
I'm responsibIe for myseIf.
True, my parents did Ieave me
in Marion's care.
But she Ieft me in no one's
care, not yours or Henri's.
You don't think I'll Ieave you
aIone with him?
Pierre! What's got into you?
I'm not the big bad woIf.
I won't eat her.
Then stay.
To me, it's an unfriendIy act...
that has spoiled
our whoIe evening.
You're the one
who's not a friend.
You never think of me.
I'm on hollday.
Just because my parents
aren't here...
doesn't mean anyone can tell me
what I can or can't do.
I do what I feeI like doing.
Henri invited me. I'm staying.
Well, good night.
Coming, SyIvain?
At Ieast give me a kiss.
I hope you're not mad.
I'm sIeepy.
I'm going to bed.
Who?
I'm fine. How are you?
Where are you?
Kiperon?
What does that mean?
Quiberon! Yes, it's near here.
I'd like that a Iot.
When? Tomorrow?
I'm free as a bird.
Marie's with her mother.
Why not today?
Give me an hour to get dressed
and I'll be there.
What's the boat's name?
La RevoItosa,
red and bIack, twin masts.
See you soon.
Did I really hurt you?
You caught me by surprise.
Sorry. I just wanted
to wake you gentIy.
Don't be a hypocrite!
I'm a man, you're a woman
with nice Iegs.
Is that more honest?
I don't understand men,
especially oId ones.
They're never straightforward.
Not you or Pierre.
SyIvain is direct.
Do you Iove him?
He hurt me
if he'd cheated on me.
But to pIay your games...
He didn't.
I toId you, I pushed him.
Breakfast'll be ready
in a moment.
Here. This is for Marion.
Give it to her.
I got a phone call.
I have to go to Quiberon.
I just have time to pack...
and drop you off,
then I'll be gone.
When'll you be back?
I won't. I'm going to Spain
on a yacht.
We'll be gone a good two weeks.
And Marion?
I'd gIadIy take her,
but there's no room.
It won't be comfortabIe.
It's not a cruise.
It's very hard, with reaI pros.
Wait tilI she gets back at noon.
I can't. I'd be too Iate.
And I hate goodbyes.
Then say you can't face her.
You're a coward.
It's not cowardice.
She wouIdn't understand.
I don't get what you see
in that other girI.
OnIy a pervert
wouId chase her...
when he's with a girI
ilke Marion.
Marion is very beautifuI.
She has a perfect body.
Too perfect, like a statue.
The figure all women want.
She's an ideaI.
I admire her,
but I'm not that attracted...
Iess than by a woman
with imperfections.
Perfection is oppressive.
If genetic scientists
manipuIating chromosomes...
could create an ideaI woman...
like in Huxley's
''Brave New WorId...''
I'm sure that woman
wouId be like Marion.
In time, all women could be made
to Iook like her.
Imagine the worId
with milllons of Marions!
That other girI
is much more artificiaI.
Her behavior,
but not her nature.
That's not true!
Marion is like no other woman.
She's unique.
Unique?
Sure, good thing, too.
All peopIe are.
Her uniqueness is so perfect...
it tends toward universality.
Get it?
No, you don't.
Kids your age don't think
about such things.
This'll be easier to understand.
Marion threw herseIf at me.
She didn't give me time
to desire her.
Learn to Iet yourseIf be
desired, or you'll be unhappy.
And another thing.
I didn't cheat on Marion
with Louisette...
but the reverse.
I met Louisette first.
We'd kissed a bit...
but I'd never gotten her home.
So when the opportunity arose,
I made the most of it.
I'd think with Marion,
other'd be forgotten.
No. I stayed true to my desire.
I feIt invoIved with Louisette.
You were much more invoIved
with Marion.
Physically, but not mentally
or by the desire I feIt.
I'd met her first,
so she had a kind of right.
But you don't
understand that either.
A bit better.
So what shocks you?
That she's a peddIer?
Are you prejudiced now?
I'm shocked you're not in Iove
with Marion, insaneIy...
like Pierre.
He has no chance!
Why? He's as good as you.
You don't like me much, do you?
RascaI!
Hands off!
Don't worry.
We're Ieaving in five minutes.
What did he tell you?
That he was going on a boat
without you...
because it was uncomfortabIe.
You bet!
Just as well.
I don't really like goodbyes.
What'll you do?
What can I do?
I mean here.
Won't you be bored?
One's never bored
in the country.
Why don't we go home?
AIready?
I have to tell you this.
Yesterday on the train,
I was thinking.
I said to myseIf that in fact...
we have no proof of what really
happened with the candy girI.
Henri could've been with her...
and made me think
it was SyIvain.
I hope that isn't true.
It wouId be...
too horribIe.
But you...
shouIdn't be upset by something
that may not be true.
I'm not upset.
Tell yourseIf it isn't true.
Convince yourseIf.
I'll remain convinced
of the opposite.
That way we'll both be
satisfied.
I agree entirely.
