The events and characters in this film are imaginary. Any similarity to others in real
life will be simple coincidence. The Producer, director and writers decline any responsibility asked of them.
We need the attention of everybody, the poor and the rich, because for Christmasthere are no borders.
Everybody who goes must enroll in our campaign "dine with a poor man"
That for one night we all be human beings.
That for one night the black hearted be generous.
That for one night the poor will dine.
-A moment
-But really, what are you doing
-A moment
-Listen, come here
-I'll just speak with my wife and I'll be back
But, what do you mean with your wife? Come
Come on right away
Be careful, that's the women's washroom
Emilia
Guard that right
Did you pick up the note from the bank?
What am I going to pick up? It's almost 7000 pesetas.
What, yes, son yes
Take this
Let go you
Ahh, what happened is that the first one is bigger since he put the leftover interest
A turn
-Is it all there?
-Do you have todays' paper?
It's busy
No don't bother counting
I took everything from the register
and not even adding my bonus pay is enough
-Out of here
-I called the shelter but..
I wasn't at the shelter, I was mounting that star on the motor car
What did they tell you at the bank?
That if we went soon this afternoon we could fix it.
And if not we'd have to go to the notary for the, I don't know, the protesting the impound.
What a pain Mother of god,
And precisely today
I asked your brother for money but he doesn't want anything to do with it
What do you mean no?
Julian, come here
Don't count on me
Come
I said no, I don't have money
You have to realize if I don't pay right now it's certain they'll impound the motorcar, man.
I'll get it back to you tomorrow, I swear.
No, I need those 40 bucks. I need them much more than you guys, man.
Besides, I'm an invalid, you have a business, a salary.
It's not enough.
-Listen, this can't be-
-Go to the men's room, you scoundrel
- No, I-I-I
- Mr Quintanilla, you have to pay me right away.
Look, look, a bank note A NOTE.
It's the same to you to pay me now or after the parade
No, listen, this is a matter for the charity women
Now they're at the station, waiting for the actors from Madrid
I'm sure they'll pay you there
-I won't get to the bank
Talk to them, tell them that the rest you'll get to them soon.
Yeah but.. what a mess, mother what a mess
Let's go Julian, man
Listen, where?
This afternoon I got a small job
I have to deliver Christmas baskets
You lout, don't you realize I'm at the edge of ruin
I'd hit you
Watch it, watch it
Let's go Mr. Quintanilla
To the station, eh!
No, to the bank.
Excuse me,
It's right next door, let's go.
But isn't this the Women's?
Yes, come in, don't be afraid, we're the workers.
Come Mr Quintanilla. -Yes
Listen Placido, who'll pick up my father?
You go. Today the bus arrives at 5 eh.
Go ahead, miss, that way on the right, whichever you want.
It's cold.
Sirs.  One each.
-Best wishes, Mr. Rodolfo.
-Thank you and happy holidays.
Thanks
-Thank you
-You're welcome
This is something personal
A bonus from me.
The one from the bank will arrive in due time, don't worry.
Remember that last year it came on a day like today
-you're welcome- but maybe this year it'll wait until after Christmas
You already know...
Jimenez, Aren't you ashamed!
But, I, since it's Christmas I was taking one for my father.
I only want serious people working here.
Jimenez!  Don't you hear the bell
Heh, maybe it's the bonus from the central office.
Last year they sent it by courier, right?
Yes sir.
It's closed.  Public opening is in the morning.
-Ask them if it's to deposit, idiot.
-Yes sir.
Is it to deposit?
Oh, OK
Pass this way
This way Mr. Quintanilla
-Afternoon, it's a bank note, where?
-There.
Oh, there. Thank you.
I have here a bank note, I've come to pay
Over there.
Good evening, I've come to pick up a bank note
-You haven't taken it to the notary, right?
-Give Here
I don't know why you people don't pay before twelve.
You want to annoy us.
N-No.
If you're prepared to pay why don't you do it like God intended
-But I'm not here to pay.
You see, it's that I'm missing a small amount, a few pesetas
I'm going to get them right now, and I'll be back in a bit, eh.
-But, man.
I was afraid you'd take it to the notary, that's why I brought my brother.
This one. I leave my brother here so you trust me, and I send you the rest right away
If you pay you pay, if not.
Remember me? I'm Quintanilla's son. The butcher.
Oh I see it. Happy holidays.  A small deposit?
Well, no, it's not for me. Do something sir, this man has-
-Yes, I heard.  A bank note with expenses.
-Yes, here it is.
We have to take it to the notary with time, so he can proceed with it before sunset.
That's the legislation.
I know, but this man has to come with me to the station to welcome the actors from Madrid
-Magnificent idea.
-For the campaign, you know,
Here' we've all requested poor men, right?
We have to buy tenderness, yes sir.
Exactly, that's what I'm saying, he's working with me.
Receives the money from the charity ladies and when he gets the money.
Of course, the money right away, I leave my brother, look at that.
I don't know, I don't know.
In any case you can deal directly with the notary.
Of course, then, you run the risk that we remove the discount.
You have a discount?
He's a worker.
I have a motor car, I carry the star.
Yeah, yeah.
That's what happens to us banks for trusting,
for not doing more investigation.
Yes, yes sir.
A cigar?
Thank you very much.
If you'll permit me, I'll keep it for after dinner.
Speaking of, you give calendars this year? You know dad always..
We'll send it to him.  Don't worry.
Thank you very much, Mr. Rodolfo, and happy holidays from all my heart.
Same here, my regards to your dad.
- Mr. Quintanilla I have to fix this deal.
- Here, Julian, take this.
I told you I have to deliver the baskets
-You, stay here
If not they'll take my note to the notary, idiot.
I'll send over the rest with Paquito.
-We don't have time.
-Stay here
Yes, let's go.
Smoke?
This one's fresh
I'd make a mess with all those numbers
Sit down, please.
Think there'll be a nice one?
Hey you, over there!
Come on, the sister's calling us.
They should tell us if we'll get dinner.
All we need is for them to send us to a house with a turkey.
Well, why do I want turkey with these teeth.
The teeth I had.
The elderly, Mr. Quintanilla, where do we put the elderly?
The elderly, well I don't know, there with the other poor.
Yes, let's go, hurry.  Let the soldiers pass.
Come you, fix that coat neck
A candle? You were going to the funeral.
But sister, I went to yesterday's.
Sister, no, we've had to take the poor from the street.
If you send those from the shelter to the funeral, families will be left without poor people.
They can't miss the funeral, it's the surest entry to the shelter.
You'll understand that with times as they are.
Come over here.
Trickster! Liar!
Sister, I wanted to see the actresses.
Let's see the ladies.
Where are the ladies from the charity.
-That ski mask?
-I got it in the war.
Take it off. You should be in the carriage setting up the living art.
Movement.
It's freezing.
And me with my sinusitis.
Gabino
What? Oh a blanket. Listen where are the ladies?
Give me your coat, I dying of cold.
Yes,take it my love.
Listen, where's your mom?
In the boss's office. The train must have derailed, we've been waiting for an hour.
To the office, let's go to the office.
Cover yourself up.
Listen, it's this way.
Some gloves. Get me some gloves.
Listen, tell me if the 412 has left there.
Ask if it's carrying the actresses from Madrid.
Listen, do you know if the train has some actors from Madrid?
What kind of actors?
Film actors, they're traveling with a journalist.
Film actors.
Later.
Sirs, the train is about to arrive.
I'm going to get ready.
The other door.
I'll tell you something about the elderly, for sure.
With this cold they must be freezing.
Isn't there some shelter, where we can put them?
Good afternoon to all. Happy holidays.
Come in.
Could we pay the man with the motor car?
He's the one who carries the float with the rich and poor men.
Yes, I've seen you. Very appropriate, right?
Thank you, but with this cold, so then we'll pay him?
Oh no, that's something for Mr. Zapater.
Come let's organize things.
Don't forget you need to take this pot.
Mr. Zapater?
No, I'm the director of the radio station.
Did you see Martita, Gabino, isn't she beautiful?
Yes, yes beautiful, beautiful.
I lent her my coat, she was very cold.
You hold the champagne.
What champagne?
What I want is to get paid.  Where's Zapater?
Here's Rivas, our administrator. Let's go.
-Can you pay me?
-Without authorization, no.
-I'll tell him, be patient.
-He'll tell him now, be patient.
Let's go. Hurry up.
Come on, I have two kids.  If they impound my motorcar I'm dead.
But what are you, on a day like today they won't impound anything.
You won't make it son.
We haven't been able to practice the living picture.
Let's go, the pot.  Mr Zapater has said it has to be there.
-The pot.
-Let's go.
I want the transmission ...
Let me see, that hat doesn't suit you
Mr Arturo, do us the favor of lending us your hat, you'll get it back.
There, that's better.
I'm coming sister.
Mr Quintanilla the elderly can't stay here. They're freezing
But the train is arriving any moment sister.
At this age you can't do this, besides this poor one has rheumatism
Well, with dinner they'll come around.
We want to be given Cognac.
-Very well, put it up front.
-Mr. Zapeter!
-Is the train coming or not?
-Yes, yes
-And the actresses, any news?
-The boss has said that-
Please, pay me now. It's the same to you and the ladies have authorized it.
Who is this? -It's the motor car guy, I don't know what he's saying about an impound.
It's 400 right?
Yeah but one more thing, I need 120 more, for the balance of the note.
Don't worry, I'll take care of the pots.
But please, give me a solution
It's Christmas
The family, understand, it's not a good time to have impounded your livelihood.
Give him the 120 Rivas, but you already know this dinner has been cooked in Cocinex pots.
-Tell everyone.
-Of course sir.
Here take this son. Take it to uncle Julian, he's at the bank at Calle Mayor
I know
Hurry up.
So your issue's been resolved?
Yes, all solved.
Oh those two, don't let them eat the turkey
-The music?
-It's in the cantina.
I'm going.
Let's go
NO, other way round.
Like that.
Let's go.
You have to go with them?
Yes, it's not my decision.
But behave, it's important
-Do you know them?
-I do.
-They must be some starlets.
-It's true, since they're from the movies.
I can see stars from our.
Alexinia, the singing child, Paquiteo, and others
accompanied by Roberto Manizar
-Isn't that Carmen Sevilla?
-I believe so.
She must have dyed her hair blonde.
When do we dine?
Patience my son.
Why is she winking?
Move aside
Listen, I think he's looking at me.
Don't kid yourself, he's looking at me
Girl, move over ok. Careful
Thank you, thank you.
Hello Olmedo.
-Listen, where are the stars?
-What stars?
The film actresses. Where's Carmen Sevilla?
She couldn't come.
But what I wanted was to take a picture of Carmen Sevilla with a Cocinex pot.
We'll fix it, don't worry
You have to understand that the top stars won't leave home.
Here comes Ladi, she's my girlfriend.
Move over son.
With stars we all know-
yeah of course but-
They'll do for the auction. The girls are pretty.
After the parade you'll be able to retire to rest at the Hotel Europa
And bathe with hot water,
-Make way. Make way please.
-Girls, girls go with the man with the hat.
They're such children.
Man, we can relax
Let's go, let's go
-Listen, guard.
-Yes ma'am?
-Can I give this man a package?
-I'll ask that you give it to his family.
Yes his family. Thank you. Very kind.
Take this, miss. -Thank you.
Poor men, spending these days in jail.
An uncovered car? I'm not going.
I'm not getting on this car with this bunch
-What's going on?
-The charity insists.
Of course, don't start getting prissy.
This isn't what was in my contract.
Forget the contract and be careful with the step..
The flowers are for me, for me
Listen. Are you the organizer?
Your purse Miss .
Don't annoy, man.
Listen, the organizer, really, not exactly
See, what I'd like to talk about is the payment.
But then yours isn't a free contribution?
-Really, man, I'm a professional.
-Frankly, I don't know.
Zapater! It's your department.
-The man with the fur will help you for sure.
-Thank you
Take our picture, Gabino. Please
I can't my treasure, understand.
-Smile, like a queen.
-Listen.
-Signs up high, big smile.
-The truck, there's a man who won't get on.
Tell me sir, what's your issue.
I refuse to continue here. This is below my standards.
Standards, yes sir, yes sir.
I've made 5 trips to America, with Mrs Maria, and Morano
And now you want to put me there?
I'm offended. I refuse. I refuse.
Don't worry we'll fix it.
For the moment get on my vehicle.
-Placido, make the man comfortable.
-Here in the side seat.
Everything's going well over here?
You can start eating the turkey.
-Offer the poor man.
-There's no more.
No more, what a disaster. Well pretend, give him the bones.
And the champagne?
If you want we'll pass by a tavern and buy wine.
You think we have time for that!
No, no, always problems.
Would you mind going on the other side?
Me again?
Yes on the right. It's better for the weight.
Watch out you'll break it.
-Sit down, here.
Ready?
Stop, stop. Stop a moment.
Damn, Some respect.
You must have offended the church.
We've given them a military salute Mr. Gabino.
Oh, oh ok. You do it the military way. I didn't know that.
Well, then now lots of joy. Joy, joy.
Joy, and a little tuning, if possible.
-And the driver?
-What do I know?
-Do you know how to drive?
-Yes, in the movies.
-Well, go ahead. Go ahead.
-I only know the hands. The feet no.
And besides, I won't tolerate what you're doing to me.
I'm decorated!
Yes, yes I know. And with much merit.
-Look, get on with the other actors.
-Leave me alone.
Hey, hey.
Mr. Rabaldon, you can relax. I've paid the bill on motorcar
-My god, in this procession?
-Sorry, a relative?
-An acquaintance, someone up in years.
-Well, then my condolences
-Don't forget the next due date. The 24th.
-Don't worry. Bye
-Let's go.
-I'm coming.
-It's late.
-I'm coming, man.
But what are you doing there?
We've lost the parade.
Even if only for one night.
We ask your generosity.
Like a good samaritan.
Mr Depablo
Mayor 37 1st right
Juan torres Martinez
Pasaje Oliveras 19
The parade!
What do you care about the parade?
There's actors from Madrid.
Besides I have to give my brother the bill from the notary
Listen
I'll be right back.
Come here, get back to work.
Where are you going!
-Hey Placido.
-Julian! I was waiting for you.
Give me the note.
That's what I was going to tell you.  I couldn't pay it.
When Paquito arrived they'd already taken it to the notary.
What did you do?
It's not my fault.
Mother of god, but didn't I tell you to pay attention.
-We're falling behind.
-What a pain
Well give me the money, fool, you're not good for anything.
-I had to deliver the baskets.
-I have to do everything.
-What's going on?
-What had to happen, and all because of you
The note, they took it to the notary.
Listen the actors have come. Start delivering.
Leave me alone.
Hey, you. Can you return my 40 bucks?
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the notary, he lives right there
-You can't do that, you'll ruin the parade.
-Please!
You've been paid and have a duty. I'll report you to the police.
-Help me, do something.
-Fine, don't get like that.
Listen, on a day like today everyone's willing to do a favor.
Yeah, that's what you said at the station.
Surely the notary will be at the casino for the auction
Get back in the parade, we've ended up at the back again...
Over there, enthusiasm, lots of enthusiasm.
That for one night we all be human beings.
That for one night the black hearted be generous.
That for one night the poor will dine.
What's that?
That's for the poor.
-When's dad coming back.
-Shut up, I'll slap you.
Here comes the motorcar
Dad. Grandpa's here.
Emilia.
-What's wrong?
-Great spot you've put us in.
Come soon. I have to make dinner.
Emilia, is that kid yours?
We'll see. I'm not sure yet.
Well, let's go in.
What have you brought father.
Oil, cheese and some buns.
Aren't we going home? I want to leave all this.
No, we'll wait here for Placido.
That way he'll take us in the car and save us the walk.
That's true your home's at the end of the world.
3000 going once
3000 going twice
3200!
3200 going once
-Listen, a man has asked for a close up
-Which man?
That one with the white hair
Tell him to wait, without Alternating current I can't do anything
Sold for 3200. The sirs Swai can pick up this beautiful star
She'll brighten your dinner with her radiant presence.
Careful
-A pleasure.
-A pleasure.
While the notary, Mr Gil, takes down the first sale of the night, the queen
The queen?
Where's Martita?
I don't know.
I think Gabino went to get her.
Bring The queen.
We have to find the queen.
She's the one who has to present the Cocinex pots.
Madam, where's your daughter?
The queen, is she a short girl, kind of ugly?
-What are you saying?
-Well, she left with a young man.
That's impossible.
Go find the queen at once.
Look for her everywhere.
Mr Quintanilla already went.
It doesn't matter.
He's out there going round like a madman
-Hold this, I'll go find her. -Exactly.
She's the one who has to hand out the pots.
Are you from the parade?
A taxi, I need a taxi.
Now's no the time to find a taxi.
Stop bothering.
Next we're going to auction Paquita del toro
Paquita del toro, eh
Paquita del toro
The dancer, embodies the qualities of the Spanish temperament
-Listen, that money's for us right.
-I doubt it.
-Of course it's for us.
-And when do we get it?
They insist it's for the charity.
Oh no, I have to bring back a present for my mom.
Well, upstairs there's no one either.
-She must have had to go out to the street.
-The coat's not here.
Come, Mr. Gabino,
She must have gone back to the ballroom.
We have to fix my problem.
You promised me you'd talk with the notary.
Leave me alone. What's important is finding Martita
Remember what the banker told us, about the sunset
Look, it's getting dark.
Martita!
-Why have they boarded up the barber shop.
-The barber shop? What do I know.
What a disaster. Everyone in the ballroom except her.
Come, don't take it like that, man.
Maybe she's forgotten something at home
I would have gone myself
Martita
Come, we have to talk to the notary.
Something must have happened.
Martita
What's wrong now.
And in that movie I played a great romantic.
Yes, a romantic, that's what I am.
Always looking for the ideal
No one knows how the artist suffers in this search.
Now, in this little city I've found the female ideal.
But, Martita!
Cover up
Can we know what you're doing here
You see, her pants ripped when she got on the car
You, the queen of the party, leave the ballroom without any respect for the audience
Take this
You have no shame.  Seduced by that idiot.
-Gabino, don't think badly
-You, shut up, you're at fault.
-I'm going to tell your mom.
-He's going to tell her mom
Ideal, you're a simple woman, that's what you are.
No, Gabino, don't get angry.
I assure you there were no bad intentions.
Yeah, and why did it have to be you, specifically you, who sewed the pants?
Because Fonsanta doesn't know.
Come on, forget this, it's not important.
-Let's go, let's go
-It's over it's over.
Thank you little miss you've been very kind.
It's nothing, man.
Let's go, calm down.
Don't worry.
Why does this man get involved in what doesn't concern him?
He's Martita's boyfriend.
I have no boyfriend.
This country's so uncivilized. Out there everything's different.
I've worked in Italy. I've worked a lot.
And in that country women-
Final opportunity of the night. The brightest rising star of our cinema
Maruja Collar
Let's see, let's see
Excuse me kid
Let's see, Marujita, what was your last movie?
Rome in Flames.
A pity, we haven't seen it here yet. And your first?
Rome in Flames
And what was your role in that magnificent production?
I played a Christian martyr
And did the lions devour you?
I don't know. My agent didn't tell me anything.
Auction her and stop with this silliness.
For the finale we offer a sensational auction,
Maruja Collar and the singing child Paquito Yepez, in a single lot.
Come gentlemen, don't be afraid.
Ahh, the beautiful queen of the ball, will present a Cocinex pot from Mr Zapater
Mr. Quintanilla
-What's going on?
-Talk to the notary.
Man, he's recording the auction.
-He'll slip out of our hands. -I tell you no -I'm telling you he will
Mr. Gil, Mr. Gil
Could you spare just a second.
-You see, right now he's working.
-Yes, I'm left without my motorcar
An auction, come on gentleman courage, a lot just like you deserve. Courage

We'll start the auction over.

We ask the respectable public, that laughable sums
will be ignored, since I'm sure it's just a joke in bad taste.

You'll see how you'll get it.
Don't worry, they'll offer more.
4000 once, 4000 twice
4000 thrice
Applause to the man who's won this lot
There you go. Weren't they going to offer more?
Let's see how we pay
I've still got my bonus, I'll give it to them.
With this sale, Damian Olmedo says goodbye
until the transmission of the dinner.
We ask those present to pick up their respective poor
to share with them their Christmas dinner.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the auction has come to an end.
Happy holidays, and thank you.
I haven't been auctioned, and I'm a lead actor.
That's something for Mr. Zapater.
A moment, Mr Gil.
Just a moment.
I don't know if you remember me.
I'm Quintanilla's son, the butcher
-Martita's boyfriend.
-Ahh, yes
I'd like to ask you a favor, this man
Placido Alonso, at your service,
This man has a bank note, and so he's gone to the bank
and they told him that they gave it to you
I haven't been able to go, I had to be in the parade.
You see, he has the money to pay it. If you would do him a favor.
Be magnanimous, he's a worker
But I don't know anything about it. That's something my intern does.
If the note hasn't been paid on time
the official will have gone to the debtor's home before sunset
He'll have noted it and,
Let's hope that's what he's done.
You see, and all because of you.
He should pass by the office and solve the problem.
That's it.
You see.
Many thanks.
-When you're ready.
-Happy holidays
-Cheers to your father.
-I'll tell him.
Gabino
Take the microphone, we're going to the De Galan house and you'll go the notary's office.
Well, where do I dine?
Look, go there with the poor, and some family will take you.
With those?
And if not I'll give you ten bucks and you can dine down the street.
I, who's dined in the best hotels in the world
Well dine where you want, but remember that Cocinex is with you.
-You've found your poor man?
-Yes sir.
So we were going to dine with Carmen Sevilla, eh?
Do you sing?
If I don't sing I won't eat?
Of course you will.
But of course.
Let's go, you'd drown in a glass of water.
If only the notes from our shop all came due on Christmas Eve.
-On a day like this, they won't seize anything. -Ok
Where are you going.
-To find a young lady who'll sew my pants.
-Gabino.
We too are taking an actress.
As president of the charity I was obliged
Although to me, these film people-
You what did you get?
Elderly from the home or poor from the street?
Those from the street are downstairs
I don't know, I don't know
I'd prefer and old person, old people are more helpless
Besides, as you know, I lost my father and
with an old person we'll remember him more.
-Hello, Rosario
-How are you?
My poor man's named Ricardo Guerra
-How lovely
-Happy holidays
Edmundo, are we ready?
Yes,yes whenever you want.
-My ticket.
-Where do you work?
At the CineRica, but my name is Carmela
Let's go find our poor man.
Oh what excitement.
You could have chosen a less scandalous one.
Yes, but there wasn't one.
Martita, let's go. You've given enough to talk about already.
Cheer up, bear with it, at home
I don't want any of those.
-Woman, it's the one we drew
-That one looks a little tidier.
Get him, quickly.
Did you come for the transmission?
No, Ma'am, Olmedo's ready
Goodbye
Let's go good man. Do you like turkey?
Yes Ma'am, I like it a lot
Fonsanta
Martita, Where's Gabino?
He went home to prepare the transmission.
So, how did it go?
I managed to get him to come dine at home.
Girl, what luck.
-And how did you do it?
-Because of the pants.
What joy, I'll call you later.
For sure, this makes such a strange sound.
Couldn't it be the cables?
It'd be horrible if we had a short circuit.
Well, this outlet needs to be free for the direct transmission,
which is what I care about.
-Mr Gabino.
-You guys do what you can.
Let me go home
This you can do on your own.
What a pain you are. Didn't we get everything sorted out with the notary?
Yes, but until I get the note in my pocket I can't relax.
Mr Gabino, these men say-
Good evening, we're from the local press
A pleasure, sit down please
The gentlemen will be here soon.
-The centerpiece goes where?
-Here, and here.
The lady asked that we first serve the poor man, and then the actress
These cables make me nervous.
Won't I get shocked when I serve the soup?
Don't worry, and if something happens I'm here to lend a hand.
Olmedo, please
Mr. Gabino, I have nothing to do here.
They're here, they're here, take the microphone,
she wants the whole tape plug it in there.
-Good evening.
Oh, what a beautiful house you have
No, humble, very humble.
Aren't you cold?
No, it's much colder in a studio.
Where it was cold was on the street,
The parade left me frozen
Is the appetizer ready?
-Where do I sit sir?
-There, right there.
You can drink anything, anything.
Well, it's getting late, I have to start the transmission.
Let's see the mayonnaise.
Talk, some laughter.
Come
Turn it on. Turn it on
Ladies and gentlemen, a very good evening.
We find ourselves in the welcoming house of the de Galán family.
Mrs de Galán, as you know, is the president of the Ladies charity
who has organized this campaign of marvelous humanity, of magnificent charity, of deep significance
This dinner, that will unite poor and rich in homes all over our city
Mr Gabino, please, my family is waiting for me in the toilets.
No! Don't say that it'll get on air.
And now the poor man
served gently by the film star
will begin his appetizer
while the men from the press take his happy picture
Eat, it's shrimp
Toads no, I don't like it.
We'll interview this old man, disowned by lady luck
that he tell us, in the name of his comrades how they feel in these moments
Please.
No, not me, no.
Enchanting, your modesty, but please
don't be afraid and tell us
Are you happy?
I, well, one can't know.
Naturally, he's overjoyed
And tell me, what's your opinion of this initiative
which has made it possible for you, and so many like you
share dinner with these generous families.
Say you're very moved
Well, I, what the young lady here said
Truly a moving picture, which all of you are witnessing in your homes
And now let's pass from serene old age to splendid youth
We will interview a genteel young lady
Kind, lovely, beautiful,
who has come to us to lift this campaign with her presence
Mr Quintanilla I'm going
How many movies have you made?
I'm going to the notary
Come here
No, no
You can't do this
I'm going to the notary
Don't leave me alone with this cable
BW, Color or Technicolor?
Color and Cinemascope
Jimenez, Pedro 7037
This one doesn't have things in order
Doesn't matter you write it down
There are things I just don't understand
Couldn't we do this the day after tomorrow?
Go on, go on.
Number 64
Levante-Ferrer, Isaias 94342
This isn't fair, man
One should go home
be with the family
Besides the poor man will be there
Damn the time when they thought up this idiocy.
-He'll hear you.
-Let him hear me.
I've been meaning to speak my mind
Why are we obliged to take a poor man.
We weren't forced.
How weren't we forced, of course we were forced.
-Evening
-Evening
I'm here to pay a banknote
We're closed for that, come back day after tomorrow.
No, I know, but I've talked to the notary,
this afternoon at the Casino, during the auction
And he told me that although the sun has set I could-
Your Name?
Placido, Placido Alonso, at your service,
From Alonso Transport
And I had the money, you know
But with this whole charity thing, coming and going
-What name did you say?
-Placido Alonso
It's the first payment on my motorcar, you know.
I like to be serious
Imagine how I am, that if I don't pay this today, my Christmas Eve is ruined
Look, it's 6820, here it is
Plus the expenses
Expenses?
But here no one's had any expenses
You don't understand, the legal fees
-You've never had a bank note?
-No.
I, on a day like today, Mr Quintanilla told me, told me
Well, how much is it altogether?
6820 from the note,
plus
143.50 from the act, your copy and the trip to the outskirts
Makes a total of 6963.50
And all because of that irresponsible Quintanilla
Saying on a day like this they won't impound anything
That's what I get for trusting
What a mess
Nothing.
I have no choice but to pay those expenses?
Well, do you have the money or not?
Well, no, no sir.
Come, let's do our thing.
Let's finish this for once.
Wait, I'll go get the money and come back right away.
I want to pay it, I'm a serious person.
I need to be relaxed for Christmas Eve
Sure you're coming back right away?
Yes sir, in a moment. Thank you.
Listen, first pick up your things
No need, my motorcar is downstairs
It doesn't matter, pick them up.
Yes thank you
You'll wait for me, right.
Come on.
It's just a moment a quick moment
Levante-Ferrer
Oh, done
Lopez Riquelme, Cristino Number 74
watch out, this one is a dependent
Come with me
So, how's it going.
Good, we're just finishing up
Good, leave it. Don't worry.
Tonight you have to go home early.
But first you'll have a drink with me, naturally.
We have to honor my guest.
Come, come to the dining room
-What do you want? A bit of Sherry?
-Thank you, thank you.
A drink, better would be if he gave us a pair of bottles.
Will you shut up.
But, why won't he let us go home?
What do I care about this poor man campaign.
Really, but why don't you retire.
You have the butcher shop, you children are grown
Why get worked up? You'll get an ulcer
Besides, leave me alone.
Tell it to him.
May we come in?
Come in, come in and have a drink
Here you have our man
Look at him
-A drink?
-Thank you.
This night is Christmas Eve
-Take down the nativity?
-Yes
This night is Christmas Eve
And tomorrow Christmas Day
Stop shouting
Mom, dad's here.
It was about time.
Come, I still have to make dinner
Here, here take the baby
A moment, let me put on my coat.
-She's wet
-Ok
Emilia
-What a disaster
-What happened?
The banknote, I have to pay the expenses, I have to go to the notary.
Hey grandpa, I need 20 bucks, lend them to me, eh.
-I'll get them back to you day after tomorrow
-I don't have anything. You're always asking.
You're the ones who should be giving to me.
Emilia, you ask him.
I have to pay the note.
-Give them to him, father
-Father, father.
I bring you oil, cheese and biscuits and now you ask for money
I don't have it. I brought just what I need for the ticket home.
Don't lie, you brought money.
Every time he comes from the village, he brings money to buy things.
Lend them to me, grandpa
I said no, you guys don't know how it is in the country.
This year everything went badly.
-Look, look
-Let's see. No more?
Mother of god.
And you, Julian
Yeah, you already got mine.
And what they gave you for the baskets?
The baskets, that scoundrel told me I'd get more than him from the tips
Well, show me the tips.
That's what he said and look,
13.50, if that helps.
It's not enough
Hey, and that?
Some guy didn't want it.
Come, with this we'll get the 20 bucks.
No, this one's for us.
We're going to turn purple.
Don't worry, we won't lose it.
It's best if they don't see it.
He told me to throw it out, but...
You'll see how it brings us bad luck
No, it was someone who said he didn't accept anything. Too dignified.
Let's go quickly.
The basket's got the answer.
They're going to see it.
Come, leave the nativity.
Nothing'll happen
Careful, we're in the middle of the road.
Careful, you're going to bring us trouble.
Placido, you're going to bring us trouble and ruin
Calm down.  Look, we leave it as a guarantee
As soon as I pay the note they give it back.
-No, then they'll keep it for a party.
-Don't be foolish.
Why would they keep it?
Mr. Quintanilla's a good friend.
Besides, there's the notary too.
Ok cover it up well
Don't let them see it.
Cover yourself up, father, it's very cold.
Put on your scarf, Paquito.
My God.
Hey, give the girl.
Up we go grandpa
If I manage it I'll stay home.
We're going.
WELCOME PILGRIMS
CHARITY
In this magnificent dining hall with handcrafted ceilings
Sumptuous lamps, brilliant mirrors
and, and beautiful paintings
Is finishing one of the dishes
of the magnificent dinner
The old man served with care
truly well by the star of the cinema
Drinks a glass of wine
The conversation, brilliant and animated
Reigns in this house like in the rest of the homes of the city
The hosts go out of their way to attend to their guests
Please, talk.
And you? You must be very old
Very, girl, very
In October of next year, 79
-Joy, Joy.
-So witty you are
But you keep yourself well, you know
Don't believe it.
It's just appearances
I have a pain all over
The sisters say I don't but
I think it's cancer
Marvelous, the serenity of this old man
Who now makes a toast to his hosts.
So yeah, I'm not well at all
Like another said they'll never take the fun I've had
You should have known me during the war.
-The African one?
-No WWI
No, no. I must speak personally with Mr. Gabino
This man has to speak with Mr. Gabino, where have they gone?
They called on the phone. A poor man has fallen ill.
It had to happen, we caught cold at the station and the parade
Please, do you know where they went? It's urgent.
In half an hour, after a break beyond our control
We'll connect with our studio so you may listen to a collection of Christmas carols
-Happy holidays to all
-Where'd they go, where'd they go!
The Higuera house, the hardware store, at Plaza San Paz
Say do you if Mr. Gabino went as well? Yes, they all went.
Thanks. Goodbye. What a mess, what a mess.
-Well, and what do I do?
-Well keep dining.
And when dinner's over, where do I find the others?
I'll escort you, my pleasure. This night more than one will get sick with that cold we caught.
What is it?
Nothing. I can't find a pulse.
My god, sacred mother, turn off that radio
Antonia, Antonia!
No, no. It must be mine.
-Child will you stop reading comics.
-Leave the children
How's it going?
Don't ask. Take them away,
This isn't for them
You've eaten enough
Come, Come. Let's go.
But, finally, is the doctor coming or not?
Yes, his wife says when he arrives they'll send him over.
I'm going to call the dentist. He'll know something.
Antonia
Antonia
Go get the dentist, downstairs.
Don Poni?
Yes Don Poni.
If you'd listened to me
We had to take a poor man, get it through your head.
You tell him, Alvaro
He's crazy.
Just what we needed. Being like you are, where everyone knows how you think, we hadn't taken a poor man.
That's true. In these small towns people talk a lot.
Naturally dad. What I don't understand is how yours is the one who got sick.
So, that De Galan lady, when's she coming?
They should be here soon
One thing, by god
Treat her with respect
-Leave me in peace
You've ruined my dinner. Besides I'm in my home and I'll do what I want
And now I'll turn the radio on
Because this sick man isn't even family
Mom, I say that if Mrs De Galan comes we should put the poor man in a bed.
You're right, we'll put him in Antonia's
You think we can move him?
Meh, doesn't have a pulse
Have you tried the other hand?
Jesus, Mary and Joseph
No, No it's useless
There's nothing to do
Antonia! Prepare your bed. We're going to lay down the poor man.
In my bed? No Ma'am. Who knows what he has!
Maybe it's something contagious, and one's very wary
Mom, if De Galan comes and sees her in the maids room it'll look bad
You're right. We'll have to take him to ours.
Get clean sheets. The stitched ones.
No better the lace ones. De Galan's coming.
And you, Alvaro, help bring the poor man.
Come, Come
And you, Matias, put on you jacket and tie.
Me, can't one be in one's house as one likes?
Antonia, lend a hand.
What a pain you are. To have to take him to our room.
Put on your bonnet, we have visitors.
The bonnet? No ma'am I just got my hair done.
Don't talk back. Put on the bonnet.
Lie the poor man down.
And give him cologne, the mosquito one. I'll go get Don Poni
My God, what a tragedy. What a tragedy!
Oh what cold.
Josefa, Josefa!
You called Maria?
By God, tell your brother to come up. Our poor man has decided to die.
My God!
Sorry, but imagine the inconvenience this is for us.
-Don't worry, I'll tell him now.
-Thank you.
No problem.
Be still you. Be still. You'll eat in a bit.
-What's going on?
-Go up.
The Helguera's poor man has fallen ill.
Here, as you see, he's very jealous.
He won't let guest be served first.
-But, your sisters don't eat?
-No, I have them on a strict diet
Look, he doesn't have teeth, in effect, so what I tried was
to make him a prosthetic, but it wasn't possible. And now I'll-
Come, they're waiting for you upstairs.
-The poor man's the one upstairs?
-Yes
Of course, Pascual, he's a neighbour of mine.
He has angina, they given him-
Oh angina, let's see Vivian, where's my lab coat and steth-
-Must be in the closet, dear, get it.
-Better be the clean one, eh.
Hurry up
This is the downside of the profession. People have no tact.
On a night like this, bothering us on a whim.
What a life, my brother's.
Don't get angry you, he'll be back soon, poor animal.
We can't leave his side. Calm, Tupi, calm.
Don't you like dogs?
So your brother's going up to see Pascual?
-Yes
-But, isn't he a dentist?
-Odontologist
-Oh, Odontologist.
-Come Vivian, please.
Will you do up the coat?
Yes sir.
Odontologist, my dear friend, is a medical specialist, a great specialist.
Want to accompany me?
Yes, he should go, so they see we have a poor man.
Well, I, I don't want to bother
Ah don't worry, they're good people. I visit them often.
Goodbye Tupi, the boss is leaving to cure a sick man. -Let's go
And he'll be back to give you a treat.
-Will you accompany me please?
-Don't be long, Poli, we're very put out.
-Back soon
-Put on a coat, dear, it's very cold.
Come on, you, eat.
Come. Eat some.
Come, it's Christmas eve.
Wait, I'll turn it on.
-What's going on tonight?
-They must be from the charity.
-It must be because of Pascual.
The Helguera's live here, do you know?
-Yes, Yes
Thank you very much. Good night.
I-I think it's the 1st right
-The stairs kill me.
-It's the first floor, woman.
Martita, my love, you should have stayed home.
What a cold, and all for not wearing a shirt.
Girl, how do you know that?
No shirt and no coat, which you've had all afternoon.
Of course others have no pants.
-Will you shut up.
Ok, enough.
These Helguera are from the casino?
-I don't know them.
-I do.
-I know, they're from the circle.
-Ah, Republicans
Ay, Gabino
-Martita! come here.
-I'll turn it on, here.
-I think it's this one.
-I've been requested as an expert.
Girl, you should have stayed home.
-Father, will we be in time?
-I'm sure it's angina.
-Again, how impatient.
-Let them wait.
-It's all untidy.
-Hurry up Matias, go.
-Antonia!
-What do you want ma'am.
Gah, I can't even read the thermometer.
Girl, what a mess you are, you can't even put on a bonnet.
Go, Go open it.
-Does he have a temperature?
-Temperature's normal.
Well, his face isn't.
-Move, move!
Not even in your own home will they let you do what you want.
-The Helgueras?
-Yes, Yes
Already here, and I'm not ready.
My God, my God.
We're the De Galans.
How many people are coming?
-Is the sick man here?
-Yes, here he is.
-Where have these people have put the poor man?
-They must have put him in bed
-Let's see.
-Go ahead, go ahead.
-Yes, a moment, I'll warn them
At least it's not cold here.
-Martita, dear, are you hungry?
-No mom.
-How strange that Olmedo isn't on.
-Yes, very strange.
-He'll be out soon.
-Well, I have to make a call.
-Where's the - Look there it is
-Ahh, I see.
Good evening, Mrs Encarna
-Sorry we were delayed, we went to pick up the priest. Is he in time?
Yes, I believe so.
Go ahead, Father.
And you too, Don Poli.
Go in, go in.
This way Father.
What horror, on a night like this.
Do you know each other?
My husband, son-in-law
The De Galan's. -Mrs Encarna is the president of the charity
My Son-in-law is a property assessor, they've come for the holidays
-Very good.
-Gabino Quintanilla, how are you?
He's my girl's fiance
Dear come here.
-Yes mom
And this man is with you?
-No he was with the doctor.
-Ah
Then he can go to the kitchen
-Listen, listen
Come, come with me. They'll give you soup.
Mrs Helguera, her son-in-law, my daughter Martita
-Charmed
-A pleasure.
-Could we see the sick man?
-Of course, go ahead.
-But it makes me a bit uneasy.
-I told you not to come.
-Right now he's free of fever.
-A good sign, let's see.
Yup, I, on the other hand, between my sinusitis
and the responsibility of this campaign
-Oh my, try it, try it.
-But please go ahead.
-No, you first -No I insist
Why isn't he in bed?
We're making it. Maruja, help me.
Don't worry, that's a vaccine. Your stomach?
Let's see.
Hold him still
What bad luck, the campaign is a success, and now.
-How is he doctor?
-Boil this, please.
Cardiac arrest.
eh?
Angina, and it's not the first.
Miss Maria, Miss Maria,
Excuse me Father
-Miss Maria, boil the needle
-Yes, yes, right away.
Right away.
Antonia!
Boil it well, I'll do it intravenously
but I don't have much hope.
I think we should leave the priest alone with the sick man.
Yes, you're right. Come Mrs. Encarna
Antonia
-Boil that quickly.
-My God, on a night like this
And everything had gone so well.
You have to overcome adversity.
Of Course, of course.
Take this. -Make sure she disinfects it.
You , to the kitchen.
-My grandsons, twins.
-So handsome
I'm thinking, the poor man was so happy
And suddenly,
He looked like he'd fainted
Right Alvaro?
-Yes, suddenly he looked dead.
If there's no solution then we should take him home.
-Naturally -Of course -That's what I say
Sit down. Excuse the mess, but you'll understand that ...
-Don't worry.
-Yeah, there's a sick man.
Do you want a drink?
You're welcome to
You're dinner was also ruined.
-Thank, thank you
Matias, bring some glasses.
It must be the doctor.
We called two, we want to do everything possible
This one doesn't inspire confidence.
-Gabino, the dandruff.
-The dandruff
A glass of Anis? -Yes
Cognac makes me cough.
-Please do you have Anis?
-Yes, a there's a nice Anis.
You want some too?
-Sir, there's a man with a Christmas basket.
-At this hour?
But Placido, please, you shouldn't have. How kind.
-No man, no.
-The notary's a real friend of mine.
No man, no.
I still haven't resolved my issue with the notary.
I bring you the basket as collateral.
-Collateral?
-Yes, man, the expenses.
-Leave it.
-The note, has expenses
I need 20 bucks
Lend them to me, man, lend them to me.
You keep it as collateral, eh
You're alway a nuisance, I can't, I can't help you. Don't you see.
How is it, doctor?
Well, this is over
Jesus, oh my God.
We have to do something, tell the shelter.
My God, what a pain for the nuns
Listen, Pascual's not from the shelter.
You're his family?
No, I'm-
A neighbour.
Pascual lives with his Concheta
Ah, he's married. We have to notify his wife. That's the first thing.
You'll see, married, married, what you call married
At this point it's the same.
You see, Pascual and Concheta are, well, together.
In other words, as man and wife.
Damn.
They live in concubinage
Jesus, Mother Mary
Gabino, we have to bring that woman here, and marry them
Yeah, but where do these people live?
No, Concheta's also part of this campaign.
Well then she's on the list. Everything's here.
Let's see, Concheta, Concheta.
Leave me. Concheta, well Concha, Concha
-There she is.
-Ah, here.
Here, with Mariluz Martin
Quickly, quickly, they're living in sin.
Don Gabino please, don't let me down. It's 20 bucks, just 20.
The motorcar's downstairs?
Yes sir, with my family.
-Take this Gabino
-20 bucks.
-Hurry up.
-We'll talk. Please is the door open?
-Matias go open the door.
-20 bucks -You'll get them, you'll get them
-My God, how these people live.
-What a disaster. Anyway.
-Listen, I'm going to inject him Can someone help me?
-Do you want us to say a prayer?
-Good idea, will you take it?
-No, no way. -No you Mrs Maria- No no
-Antonia, Antonia
-Not now, pray girl, pray
-The rosary!
Keep still, this is no time to play.
What are you doing boy, you'll release the break and give us more problems.
I'm not doing anything
They're here.
About time, man.
-Thank you, wait for us, please.
No, call Sereno, it's freezing.
Don't you see that then I won't arrive in time.
How annoying, how annoying you are. First we'll go to that woman's house.
Then I'll give you the money, without taking the basket
You pay your note, and you go have dinner with yours.
Fine, and what do I do now with the family.
-Let them wait upstairs.
-Hare Julian. Out everybody.
No, calm, calm.
Mr Matias, please
Could the people go up to your house. Unfortunates, while we go?
-Well, I, naturally.
-Thank you.
There, it's resolved.
I have to do everything.
-What's going on now.
-I'll be back soon. -Yeah so you said.
Here everything is is a mess
Can't even dine.
-Come on. -Another year here. For this I won't leave the village.
Upstairs quickly.
Paquito, be good.
Placido please, we won't be in time. There's a man on his death bed.
My coat!
Forget it.
-Going up for it? -No, no. The dying one's me, with my sinusitis
-Where is it?
-Eberia 38
Look how the fish drink in the river.
What a pain!
How strange men are.
In the end they always do the same thing.
Look, such a cute garter
And I have to wear this garbage.
And I'm so pretty, without needing any tricks.
What a shame the 70 bucks.
You like it?
It's a gift for you.
-Thank you miss?
-For the good it'll do me.
And this is just a gift.
I'll give you something else later.
No don't take this.
It's very good
I'm going Chatito
-I was getting ready.
-Don't be stupid. A kiss.
I'll get something from Ramiro for you in a bit.
Thank you miss.
No, I can't Marilu, I can't stand her.
Come Ramiro, don't be like that.
The poor woman is behaving wonderfully.
Yeah, but I have no freedom.
Besides you never know what can happen.
You don't understand
I've had to move mountains to be here with you tonight.
Then I come, and I find that horror there.
If you'd sent a note.
-Leave it, I'll clean it later.
-No, I don't want you to ruin your hands.
A kiss
A kiss on the little hands.
I tell you, until the last minute I wasn't sure I could come.
-Why did you bring her, Marilu?
-One has to be charitable.
A moment.
We'll soon bring the champagne.
Yes, yes
Every time I think that I, some day, could see myself like that, I get -
I get the urge to cry.
No don't cry my dear. That'll never happen to you.
That's what I'm here for.
That's why your Ramiro's here.
Listen, did you put it on?
-Yes
Imagine what a good time we would have had alone.
Ugh, don't you have a heart?
I, you know it more than anyone
I have a need to do good things.
Come, dry your hands and let's go.
Why don't you serve her desert in the dining room while we stay here
Don't be a nag, Ramiro.
The poor woman will leave soon.
Oh and one thing, try to be happy.
Don't put on that sour face.
Well, we're here.
How was dinner?
You like marron glacé?
But miss why did you bother
Anything would have-
-But it's no bother. Right Ramiro.
-Ah, no.
Go, put on your coat.
And champagne, you like champagne?
I think so, but you it must be so expensive.
-A day is a day. Besides, you're our guest.
-You're very kind.
-God will repay you, miss.
-You see.
-You don't have children?
-No
-Oh, what do I do?
-I don't know.
-This is my ruin, my ruin.
-Do I open?
-Yes, but where, where do I hide?
-There, there.
What silliness
Who could it be?
I'll go see.
Good evening, we're from the campaign.
Is Concepcion Vivas here?
-Yes a poor woman's here.
-You have come with us.
Me? I've done nothing wrong, I have an artists license.
-No, not you, the poor woman.
-But?
I'm sorry, you have to come with us.
Come, we're in a hurry. -Don't worry it's for your good. Nothing's wrong.
-It's ok, they're from the charity
-Miss, tell the gentleman I had to leave.
-Oh yes, of course. Good night.
-Good night.
Happy Holidays
Good Night.
-A gunshot, it was a shot.
-No it's the festivities.
The joy of the Holidays.
-Have a good night.
-You too
Ok, they've left.
-What's wrong love?
-This thing, I got hit in the eye.
-What a night you've given me.
-Hey, look.
-Look
-What, I can't see anything now.
-Let's go to the kitchen for some ice.
-No, the kitchen, no. A rest.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God-
Antonia!
Open.
-Must be Gabino
-Too soon, must be Alvaro.
Blessed as he was for years and year. Amen
-Let's see if it's your husband.
-Ok, let me go.
Come in.
Well then, the sick man is discharged and so is outside my jurisdiction
Besides, I'm above this.
Doesn't matter in some ways he's still a subordinate.
I repeat, according to the law of Feb 12, 1861
A superior judge may act in a case like this.
Besides, I assume, in a wedding in articulo mortis
The military hierarchy can intervene in place of the legal authority.
Commander Carlos
Good Evening Mr. Carlos. We've interrupted your dinner. -No problem
-Excuse us, but in a case like this.
-Always at your service.
-Well sirs, that's it, he's calmed down.
How?
Is he dead?
No. He just fainted.
Let's the injection is good for something.
Hi, Miss Fonsanta, please.
-Good Evening
-Good Evening
It would have been best to have the wedding at the office.  -We'll if he's so ill...
Is it you?
We've had to leave home.
No no, don't put him on. I'm ashamed.
Pass, pass this way.
Yes it's me
You actors always see things like that.
Sorry, I have to go.
-We have to fix him up.
-Antonia, bring a veil
I-I-I was calling to 2-4-3-2, sorry.
Hey girl, who're you talking to?
Hey? Listen, I won't tolerate this.
Answer me coward. Coward.
-Have some balls. They're all like this.
-Please Gabino.
It was the actor, that piece of garbage.
-Hey, the man of...
-What's your name, I can't recall
-Gabino Quintanilla, son of Lucas, of the butcher shops.
We were talking, we were talking about transporting the sick man.
That motorcar man, could he take him?
I don't know, he's in a hurry. Something about a note he has to pay.
A note is no problem. We pay him and that's it.
-Still have a cold?
-The worst is my sinusitis, which'll be chronic.
Man, don't worry I have bronchial issues too.
-Wait, wait a minute. wait.
-Gabino Quintanilla, talk to him.
-Placido!
-Yeah woman!
Placido -Yes
It's no issue for you
Now, after the wedding, we have to take the sick man.
No way! What I want is to get paid and go to the notary.
-About the notary, I give you my word.
-And my family?
We haven't dined. That's the least of it, what bothers me is that darn note.
-Ahh the note
We have to get him out of here.
If something happens in my home, the campaign will be a failure, understand.
Placido, I'll fix it. I'll call the notary and tell him you're delayed. Agreed? -No
Take into account that this family will compensate you, money's always handy
And since the I'll fix the deal with the note.
Do you know the number?
-Marvelous, marvelous, for me it's a lifesaver,
But try it for yourself.
-Alvaro, he's come to.
-He's come to?
Don Gabino! But then, when will you call, Don Gabino!
Pascual, don't you hear me?
It's me, your Concheta.
-They're going to marry us.
-Father, the sooner the better.
For now he's conscious.
Bring the flowers from Grandfather's portrait.
Please, your name
Concepcion Vivas Brozas
Concepcion Vivas Brozas, will take as a husband
-Pascual Ruiz Oyos
-Pascual Ruiz Oyos
Yes.
Of course yes.
Pascual Ruiz Oyos, will take as a wife Concepcion Vivas Brozas
-Ehhh
-But, he's crazy
In a daze, he's in a daze
Pascual
Pascual, you're in bad shape.
You have to marry.
You're in sin!
Come, say yes.
Please, meditate on it.
What will we do?
This man is stubborn, leave it to me.
Wait. Insist Father, insist.
Come, Pascual, give me an answer
Pascual, it's me.
Your Concheta
You've always loved me.
Say yes, Pascual
Say yes.
Don Gabino, please. Pay me or call the notary.
-What a pain you are.
-Don Gabino, put it on, put it on Don Gabino
Look, you plug it in.
-And you breathe.
-Come on, please
It doesn't matter that it's used?
My God, I wouldn't lend it to you if it did.
Now breathe deeply, with rhythm
-Well, how is it?
-A little sour, isn't it?
-But that's what cures you.
-Please, Don Gabino, don't waste more time.
-Call the notary, now.
-Get that kid to be quiet.
-Quiet, there's a moribund man.
-Emilia
Look Placido, I can't take anymore. I'll take the family and kids
-And go even if we have to walk.
-Wait, wait
Hello
Is this Mr Gil's home?
Is Mr Gil home? It's Quintanilla.
-From the butcher shops.
-From the butcher shops.
I'm with the man with the note. He'll be a bit delayed.
-Please, take that thing off man.
-We'll be there in a bit.
Thank you Mr Gil.
And Happy-
Holidays
That's it, now you can relax
Have a drink
Can he have a drink?
Of course! A small drink?
Come, have a drink
Tonight's Christmas Eve. Take it.
Listen, please, my family, could they eat something?
Really now, it's just an instant.
We're guests.
Excuse him.
Hey, and Pascual?
I don't know, let's go see.
What a mess, for sure.
I breathe deeply, but-
Go on, go on.
At the start you always cough a bit.
But it's a healthy expectoration.
It wouldn't be the first time it saved me from pneumonia.
Pascual.
Let's go Pascual, let's go. Say yes.
Join hands, please.
Ego conyugo vos in matrimonio.
In nomini patris et filio
Et espiritu santi. Amen.
-In good time, Concheta
-Be happy.
So, are you done being angry?
-No.
And I have a cold because of you.
He called me. As queen of the ball I had to answer.
I'm not interested at all, those actors are so fresh.
-Listen, what's wrong?
-I'm a woman as God intended.
A recidivist that's what you are.
-Gabino, let's go eat.
Mr Quintanilla
Listen, Don Gabino, this man with the note, will he take him? Yes or no?
Take him as soon as possible, soon as possible.
Because you'll understand, on a night like this, this situation
It's very unpleasant, very unpleasant.
I'm not waiting anymore. If someone wants ham, follow me.
-Slow down.
-No Placido, he's right.
You can't go around all night, this way and that, with the kids.
I know Emilia, I know. It's just a moment.
I've already agreed with Mr. Quintanilla, We'll go eat.
So, Don Gabino, do we take him or not?
We take him, we take him.
So the man will agree?
-If it's quick yes.
-In that case let's go.
-Maruja!
-Gentlemen, I think he's died.
-He's died?
-Gabino, give me the 20 bucks, I'm leaving.
What you're leaving?
Naturally, no we don't have to take him.
Precisely, that's why we have to get him out of here. -Matias, please.
No pleases. This dead man isn't ours and I don't want him here a single second longer.
Miss. We have to remove the cadaver.
We can't take him on the truck with us, everyone would find out.
-I'm sorry.
-What do you say, doctor?
Well I, to tell you the truth, can't certify him.
-Why not?
You'll understand. My specialty is extractions.
-But if a patient died, who'd certify?
-The judge.
Fine, fine, I'm not interested in this deal. You pay me for services rendered and that's it.
Calm down, calm. Your job is transportation, as I understand. -Yes
Good, then you'll transport the dead man, we pay you and Happy holidays.
-Besides I've already called the notary.
-Fine, let's get this over with.
I'll take him, but first I go to the notary, eh.
You can't leave a dead man on the street!
Oh no, with me has to come one you, who's responsible.
-If I go alone and a guard stops me?
-Gabino
-Gabino!
-No, not me.
-No, not me!
-Come, Gabino, you can't deny him.
Come, Martita, you ask him.
Go, go my love do it for me. I'm very tired.
It's always up to me to do the dirty work.
Hey, Julian, lend me a hand.
-We have to take the dead man.
-What a role you've found.
Feel better?
-Yes thank you Rodolfo
-You know that it's always at your service.
-What a disaster!
-The cable-
I think we can't take him out like this.
Mrs Maria, I think we should cover him with a blanket.
Yes, yes yes yes
Antonia! Bring an old blanket, and my coat.
-Did they get married?
-Married. As God intended.
Child, what are you doing.
-It's time -The day I think of-
-Shut up father, shut up.
-Such a cute kid. You raise him yourself?
Yes, but he already eats everything. He's 3 months old.
Edmundo, still have bonds from the campaign? -I still have a few.
-Give one to this poor woman.
-Food or clothing?
-Oh my god, It smells bad in here.
-It's the cheese.
Do you want a piece?
-No man, I don't want cheese.
How complicated life can be
Ma'am, here's a blanket.
-This way ma'am, go ahead
-Please, permit me a moment.
Paquito, you take the basket.
Wait a moment, I think a neighbour is going down.
Boys.
Boys, don't be afraid. It's just a man who's asleep.
Listen, excuse me for insisting about my fee.
Oh yes, don't go yet, I'll consult with the Aranzadi
-Oh my god.
-Careful, careful
How unfortunate I've been.
Ay, Pascual
-Paquito, watch the basket.
-On this night
-A moment, a moment.
-Do we rest?
No, better in one go.
Come, we're there.
My poor love.
-Paquito, son, don't push.
-I can't with the basket.
Be careful.
What a misfortune.
-What a pity mom, a pity.
-My god.
I'm going to bring the priest closer, I'll be right back.
-Oh dear God.
-Let's go, let's go
-Watch out he's slipping.
-I can't go further, couldn't we bring the the other car closer?
-Pull, pull, it's just 2 steps
-I'm already tired.
Help her out, stop.
-How he loved riding in cars.
-Bring it down, girl.
Gabino
-And now what do we do?
-Give her to me.
Get on, you get on first.
-Ok, up.
-Go.
My God.
-Lend a hand.
-Yes, yes.
-It's done.
-Cover him up well.
Let's tie him, Julian.
Oh, how he loved riding in cars.
Leave it,
Leave it.
Well, with all this, those people haven't compensated me.
Oh no? Well then tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Tomorrow they'll want nothing to do with it. -Sure man.
I should leave the dead man strewn on the street.
The widow, be sensitive.
Besides, the important thing was the note, no?
Fine let's go now!
-Hold him well.
-Don't worry sir.
Imagine we lose him.
Do I go?
Let's go.
Thank goodness, it's all sorted out.
-A pleasure.
The pleasure was ours ma'am.
-Matias, say goodbye to Mrs Encarnacion.
-Ahh, good evening Ma'am
And you Don Poli, thank you. Tomorrow we'll talk about-
-No, no
-Let's go Edmundo.
Excuse me, but I've left my two sisters alone.
Don't worry. Let's go, let's go
Martita
Goodbye friend, I'm sorry I couldn't provide you a good night.
No, but I'm not leaving.
Well, I'm just saying, since we left the dinner unfinished. I don't mind returning.
Of course, go ahead.
But it'll be cold
Christmas eve is coming
Christmas eve is going.
And we will go away
And we'll never return.
-The fault is yours.
-No it was you who wanted to change him.
You insisted on giving him a drink, and you see how he's gotten.
Calm down. Drink some coffee, drink it. Go. Drink it.
-All the blackies drink some coffee.
-I can't stand any more.
You'll see what you do with your poor man.
I, but-
I'm going to change. We won't make midnight mass.
Fine woman, fine, fine.
Fine calm down. Relax.
We're going to the midnight mass
No, don't drink any more.
You'll stay here, until they come to pick you up.
Here, sit down.
Yes, stay still.
-Do you like jotas?(folk dance)
-Yes, a lot.
I know a very pretty one.
I gave you one on the roof top
And gave you one on the stairway..
Another on the stairs.
-Some men are here to pay a note.
-Tell me tomorrow how many there were.
-At this hour? This is a bad joke.
Dear Mr. Gil, Quintanilla, of the butcher shops
-I've come her with Mr- the hat-
-At 12? -We've called ahead.
Who called?-Shut up- No, nothing really it's a case of-
Imagine, all afternoon worried about the note.
-The point, the point.
I'll listen in honor of your father, but you shouldn't bother one on a night like this.
-Go into my office.
-You, relax.
Sleep it off son, sleep it off.
There you are, there you are.
Good.
Let's not lose time.
I won't make it to midnight mass.
-In whose name is it?
-Placido, Placido Alonso, at your service.
I was here on time, you see, but then with the stuff about the expenses.
-And then since Mr. Quintanilla called you.
-But who called who?
-Mr Quintanilla called you.
-It's of no importance
-You didn't call.
-How much is it? -6820
-Here they are. Count it.
-Wait, just a moment.
-But, this letter doesn't list the collateral.
-What, so there's more expenses?
No, simply that if you hadn't paid, nothing would have happened.
So let's see. I don't pay it and nothing happens?
That's it. The article lacks executive power.
-Sirs, Happy Holidays.
-Wait. Morally you're obliged to pay.
No! With what this damned note has made me suffer. I'm not paying.
Besides, the intention has been noted.
-Listen
Listen, if you don't pay it now it'll be claimed in a trial.
-Fine, do what you want.
-How much? -143.90
Hundred
And you don't give me anything?
The important thing was the note right?
Don't greedy.
And make note that this comes from my own pocket.
You're cheeky, you didn't make the call, you don;t give me anything.
The fault is mine for being an idiot.
-Look, I take the note with no illusions.
-Here's your letter.
-Your change.
-Many thanks Mr. Gil
Happy Holidays I'll say hi to dad on your behalf.
Are you ready?
Yes
-Ma'am, very sorry for the bother.
-We won't make it in time.
-Let me throw your friends out of here.
-What a fondness this man has taken to us.
Lie down, tumble down.
-Goodbye
-I should tumble?
-What church are we going to?
-I have a tumbler to wash my clothes.
I have a tumbler
Come here, fallen one.
Oh Mother ines, all the blackies drink coffee.
She was on my right man.
Yeah but to turn you have to signal.
I signaled
If you had signaled.
It's not my fault.
Hey, can't you see!
Shut up for once.
Slow, the basket will fall.
Slow, slow, let's get this over with.
Where's the house?
A little further. Poor Pascual.
It can't be changed now ma'am.
It has to happen to all of us someday.
He was so good.
Around there, the stairs.
Come on, it's the near the barracks.
-Watch it, I'm braking.
-I did my service here.
Quickly.
Courage woman, now you have to think of yourself and make heart from guts.
You have to live.
Watch it Placido, use your shoulder.
Stop.
Who's there?
Good people.
-What people?
-Christmas campaign.
We're compatriots
We have a sick man.
-But isn't he dead?
-Shut up, don't make waves.
-May we?
-Continue
Where is it?
There, there.
This way, this way.
-I can't any longer.
-Of course, since you're not used to it.
And you have the light part.
My God, what will become of me now.
We're here.
Let's see where do we put him?
There on the bed.
This way, so narrow?
My God, tis is old age.
The head.
Watch out Placido, I can't fit.
Ok, now.
We have to put him on the bed.
Let's see.
My old age.
-He's crooked.
-From sitting.
With this cold.
Poor Pascual, Poor little Pascual.
What do we do?
We have to go.
We have to eat.
-I feel sorry for her.
-Excuse me
You're very kind.
Calm down, he's perfectly fine in there.
-Yes, but he'll have to be buried.
-Certainly, but don't worry
The van will take care of it.
Please, sit down. Sit down
Thank you ma'am, but we have to go. The campaign.
-Of course.
-Bring the basket.
-You're going to give it to her?
-Bring anything from it.
-Ham, sausage, any-
-But it's mine.
-We have to console her.
-Yes I agree, you'll eat a little something.
Thank you.
Come, come, you don't need to thank us. But we have to leave.
-Hey. -Go kid.
-I'm going.
Run, take up a package. Hurry.
What cold
What a night.
How unfortunate, now that he was going to get a place in the town hall.
-Take it.
-With the hope he had.
Oh dear God, what a life.
And on Christmas of all days.
Take it, take it. You probably didn't have dinner.
Eat, eat. You have to resign yourself and come out ahead.
The important thing is not to let yourself go.
Come, eat something.
Eat, good woman, Pascual is in heaven.
-Come, a little effort. A little effort.
-Weakness is worse.
You're all very kind. With the hope we had.
And now...
You never know what's best.
Resignation.
-My thoughts are with you.
-We're nothing.
Goodbye friend.
-Well, as we said.
-Have a good night.
And the campaign was going so well. What a fatality.
My poor guy.
The hope he had.
Poor woman, she'll be alone with the dead man.
-On a night like this.
-What, do you want us to stay with her?
-No, but...
-Don't start now.
Ok. What's the widow doing?
Nothing, what'll she do.
Come, let's go home.
What a night you're giving me.
Placido, please, take me to the De Galan's home.
Don Gabino, we haven't eaten, man.
Julian, I'm going to turn the motorcar around.
But, you can't leave me here.
-I'm too far from home.
-Well get yourself a cab.
What taxi?
Besides, I'm sick.
-Listen, can you take photos at night?
-Yes
Why don't you take a picture of us all in the motor car, with the star.
It would be pretty.
Well, look, that's an idea. I'll do it if you'll take me.
Stop, we're going to have our picture taken.
-Placido, a moment.
Stop, I'm going to take a picture, as a souvenir.
Listen, the girl's getting a cold, Don Gabino.
Am I good like this?
Look this way.
Bah another day, we're in a hurry. Leave it.
The child, a smile from the child.
We live in San Sisto, no.
Put on happy faces.
-There it is.
-Come, get in.
Happy Holidays, Don Gabino!
My girlfriend's waiting!
Out.
Hey Manolo, have a look at my motor car. Happy Holidays.
-You too.
-Thanks, goodbye. Ugh, I got Quintanilla's cold.
Come Placido, pick it all up. The tablecloth.
Yes Emilia
Come, thank God we're home.
It's about time.
What a night you've given me,
Come, Paquito.
Father, be careful with the steps.
-Is there sea bream?
-No, there's no sea bream.
Just what we needed.
A Christmas Eve with no sea bream.
Is not Christmas Eve.
Forget the sea bream.
Partridges, foie gras, sweet ham.
Oh Paquito. How you're going to enjoy it.
I want a Zambomba, Shut up you fussy boy.
What a disaster. -You're tired.
I can't see anything.
Come Paquito, bring the crib so the girl will be with us.
-I'm going.
-Today we're going to eat modern food.
-Like the Americans.
-I want sea bream.
The problem is you're not used to eating well.
Or do you think rich people eat sea bream?
No, I don't like tin cans.
They give you scurvy.
Come, look at this cheese.
The preserve them-
Come, Emilia. Are we eating or what?
-I don't feel like anything.
-On Christmas Eve you have to eat.
Of course.
Fine, make us whatever, then.
Ok, time to turn on the stove.
I would have gone to bed.
But turn on the stove, we everything here. Look.
-Asparagus, pork meat, banded cigars
-Don't talk so much.
Go get the table and chairs, they belong to the ladies and will get lost.
Come Julian, and next month, again with the same mess.
Don't be a glutton.
-Who me? Why do I care about that?
-Turn off the radio, grandpa, it's late.
-The girl is coughing.
-She'll get bad.
Damn it all. Of course, all night this way and that catching cold.
Poor thing
Right now, man, return it.
Where's the basket?
You'll go to jail as a thief.
-Emilia! -What is it?
What's wrong that they make such a racket?
What do I know what's gotten into them now.
Placido, what a racket, what's wrong.
-Bring the basket!
-Hey it's mine. I'm telling you it's mine.
-Return it to me.
-Besides, you haven't paid me anything, exploiter!
But what's happened?
The owner of the basket. He's come to claim it.
-Didn't they give it to him?
-That's what he said, but look.
Man are you willing to repeat that about being a swindler.
Of course I'll repeat it, where you like, bandit.
Everyone will know you're a family of thieves.
Leave the family out, leave it out.
Here's the basket, check to see nothing's missing. Give it to him.
Didn't you say I'd get tips?
You're the thief! - Come shut it.
-Yeah it's best that he shut it.
He should, tonight I'm not doing anything because it's Christmas Eve.
In the morning I'll file a complaint, for this.
Let's see if you dare. I too can denounce you, for not sending bottles you bill for.
Besides, they shave weight. I've seen it.
I'll leave your other leg like the first.
If you have the guts.
Go in, you.
Bandit!
-I'll break your leg. -I'll kill him.
-Come Placido. Come Julian, leave him
Come,inside, come get inside. And you go away, idiot.
-I'll go when I want to.
-Loser.
-Come up.
Come up if you're a man. I'm waiting. Coward
Good for nothing
You're good for nothings.
All these wretches are the same.
Mother at the door's a child
Shivering is he from cold
Go tell him to come in.
He will get warmed up.
Because in this land
there's no longer charity.
And there's never been.
And never will there be.
