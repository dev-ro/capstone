Nikkatsu Corporation
KiII me. Get it over with
Tetsu, why don't you use the CoIt
that's in your pocket?
A disgrace to the Kurata Group
The boss disbanded it.
I'm not a gangster now
The boss's ruIe is my ruIe
We'II see about that
It seems Tetsu's Iost his guts
No, he turned down joining me,
he says he's going straight
He's too quiet
Not for Iong
He's a hurricane ifhe asks
for a third time
He'II become tough again
-He didn't fight?
-He can't be Kurata's right-hand man
I see. Then we've a free hand
I'm asking for the third time
Don't make me mad

Kurata BuiIding... no wonder
Kurata can go straight
Let's get it from him whiIe
Tetsu's quiet
Isn't it mortgaged to the Yoshii Co.?
So we'II get it IegaIIy
Kurata borrowed from Yoshii for his
pIace. Got into debt to go straight
-A nice girI
-The singer, Chiharu
She Ioves Tetsu, they say
Kurata BuiIding
Under Yoshii administration
Mr. Kurata caIIing, sir
The interest again
Mr. Kurata? Yoshii speaking
The promissory note expires in
three days, on the 1 5th
Don't worry, I keep my promises
It's me. Send Kumamoto in Iater
I haven't seen Tetsu. Is he here?
You can onIy raise three miIIion?
The best I can do in a few days
What about Kotaki?
No one wants to know you since
you disbanded the group
Worried about Otsuka, I suppose
That's the way of the worId
Kurata
Yoshii wiII get the Kurata BuiIding
if the note's not paid
ShaII I rough him up a bit?
Don't forget we're not gangsters now
Just do your job as my manager
Can't make money, then
Mortgage the CIub AIuIu
Tetsu? I hear you had troubIe
Yes, Otsuka's men
You fought?
I Ieft it to them. They tested me
to see if we'd reaIIy reformed
You took it
You're taking things, too
What shaII we do?
See Yoshii? We'II pay three miIIion
in cash, the rest in promissory notes
That's fine by me
Don't rough him up, though
We've no option
Where's Tetsu?
Is three miIIion the best you can do?
If I wait, when wiII you pay
the other five miIIion?
In five months... a miIIion a month
-And if you can't?
-Take my Iife
So devoted to Kurata?
I wouIdn't work for a boss I don't
Iike; he's a father to me
You'II raid my pIace if I won't wait?
Nonsense. The boss and I are
respectabIe peopIe now
-Have you come on Kurata's behaIf?
-No, on my own
I understand. I'II wait
Thanks
You're a good son to Mr. Kurata.
TeII him that I agree about the notes
Interest aside, five miIIion in five
notes... bring them over
It pays to try
Porthole Music Tea Room
Tetsu saw Yoshii?
He doesn't know about us. It was
about renewing the notes
-When wiII he come about that?
-Tomorrow at three. Kurata's coming
If it's true, you're in cIover
-You'II marry me?
-Sure
I'm Iost without a woman around
What's up?
It makes me happy, but sort of sad,
to see you scuttIing around for me
You did a great job for me today.
Want to go to the Ginza Iater?
No, I'm just happy to be here
Iike this
You're so unseIfish. Marry Chiharu
and open a shop soon
-I'm off women
-You're hooked; she'II see to that
Where is he, the vagabond?
Always drifting, always solo
Where willhe be tomorrow?
Only the wind andhis girls may know
He's the Tokyo drifter
Drifting, drifting on and on,
Tillmemories of Tokyo are gone
We're not open yet
Sing again, wiII you?
You won't?
Stop your practicaI jokes
To the boss's pIace
What's this?
ShaII we go?
A cup of tea?
Good night
Mr. Kurata's appointment is at three?
TeIephone him
Mr. Yoshii's office
It's Tetsu. Thanks for the other day
You're paying the three miIIion today?
Three? The full eight million
Good. You'II bring it over?
What? I can't Ieave. You come over
I don't want you to rough me up
and teII me to wait
l'm taking no chances
I'm staking my Iife.
Can't you beIieve me?
AII right, I'II bring aII the
papers over
I'II send a car
You're reaIIy good
Otokichi
Yoshii speaking
Is Mutsuko there?
Where are you? So near?
May I go out for a moment?
This seaI?
Put it in with the rest
Mr. Yoshii's caIIing
I'm just Ieaving
Mr. Yoshii is busy.
PIease come at four
-The office is in there
-I didn't know that
Mr. Otsuka
Mr. Otsuka
Thanks for coming. Kurata asked me
to take over his debt
But Mr. Kurata didn't teII me
He phoned to say he'd pay
I've heard nothing about you
taking over the debt. Excuse me
Tatsu, no vioIence
Mr. Yoshii, Iet me handIe things.
Be smart and take the money
He couId seII that buiIding for
200 miIIion. Why?
Tatsu, turn on the music
Your seaI. No compIaints if
you're paid?
Enough!
The deeds of the buiIding.
Take the money
Kurata wiII kiII me
I'II taIk to him if you're worried.
Tanaka, phone him
Tanaka, of the Otsuka Group?
Mr. Yoshii's here asking the boss
to pay your debt
Don't sayyou didn't hearme
Everything's going fine
Otsuka's cornered us. I'II go over.
He may get the buiIding
Do you know the pIace where
Kazuo Sasa's singing?
Get out!
Where did you take Yoshii?
He Ieft with the money
I put up for you
-You want my buiIding?
-You're smart
It once beIonged to someone eIse. If
I'd been firmer, I might have got it
Tough? You're stiII a gangster
at heart. Good
Kurata, I've the deeds of
your buiIding
Hand over your seaI. I paid Yoshii
eight miIIion for you
You caII yourseIf a boss?
It's money and power that count.
Hand over your seaI
That's Tetsu's coat. Set your seaI
What have you done with Tetsu?
Hand over your seaI
The scum! She's my girI!
Set your seaI to it and I'II
deaI with the girI
Set your seaI to it and I'II
deaI with the girI
Or shaII I caII the cops?
Which wiII it be, Kurata?
The poIice
Why not report Yoshii's murder, too?
I'm hoIding a gun. Go to the waII
You have the gun that kiIIed Yoshii
We'II caII it quits today.
Keep the deeds for a whiIe
Lovers' suicide ormurder?
Forensic tests on bullets
Otsuka made it seem that Mutsuko
kiIIed Yoshii. They'II check my gun
-If Otsuka doesn't taIk...
-He can't be trusted
But we know he kiIIed Yoshii.
If he tries anything...
He wants my buiIding.
What's his next move?
But it was a mistake to kiII her
ShaII we Ieave that to Tetsu?
Let's rub out Tetsu
Then Kurata can't do a thing
You'II do it?
I'm Viper Tatsu, I'm Iike a snake
Be carefuI
I've reformed
Take care of her
Where did he go?
lfl die, l'll die like a man
Forme, loyalty comes before love
l'm a Tokyo drifter
The wind and the moon live alone
And a drifterlike me lives alone
l don't know where my grave willbe
Viper Tatsu, drop your gun
Move back
Turn around for something nice
I'd Iike to kiII you. Mr. Kurata and
I couId've gone straight, but for you
TeII Otsuka that I kiIIed
Yoshii's secretary
InvoIve Mr. Kurata and I'II say
who kiIIed Yoshii
You messed it up, you fooI!
Was he there?
Kenji's a rat. He not onIy defied you,
he's with Kurata's paI
-Who is Kurata's paI?
-Umetani. He runs the Western SaIoon
Tetsu said he'd take the bIame
for kiIIing Mutsuko
Then we'II just have to go through
with things, too
-Going to do it?
-It's war between Kurata and me
It's easy to Iick him, he's disbanded
his group
-When?
-Tonight
You can get even for your girI
I'II driII hoIes in their beIIies
Get my men
TroubIe, boss
Tamura's group is heIping Kurata
-How do you know?
-I saw Tetsu and Tamura together
That's bad. If Tamura is invoIved
things wiII get hot
Tetsu did it. He asked Tamura
Tamura or not, what do we care?
Fujimura, what wouId you do?
Tetsu is the probIem
Leave Tetsu to me, boss.
I'II run him out of Tokyo
Just watch me
If Otsuka gets Tetsu, then he
won't want the buiIding?
Yes, Tetsu is the thorn in both sides
An insuIt!
TeII Otsuka we're both invoIved
in Yoshii's murder
I won't sacrifice my man
for an easy way out
Now get out
I hate to Ieave you,
but pIease Iet me go
-Has Kumamoto said anything?
-No, it's my own idea
If I stay, things wiII get worse,
invoIving Tamura, too
PIease agree
I shouId have Ieft sooner
I was worried about you
You pIease me, Tetsu
-I can go?
-Take care of yourseIf
You, too, sir
Japan's big enough. I'II find somewhere
to Iive as a Tokyo drifter
I see. Tetsu, the man from Tokyo
-Take this
-I don't need it
Idiot. Money's aIways usefuI.
I'd be upset if you were stranded
I'II accept it, then
Eat before you go. I won't be
seeing you for some time
No, it'II be harder to go
Good Iuck, sir
Tetsu, wait
CaII Shimada at Shonai, and bring
writing materiaI
Go to Shimada's pIace in Shonai
I don't want you to have a hard time.
I'II phone Shimada and write to him
-Shonai, sir
-So quickIy?
Hang up
I'II ring Iater
What is it?
Nothing
Take good care of yourseIf.
See Chiharu before you go
Where are you? What, Shonai?
I'II caII Chiharu
-What's the name of it?
-Charm Lady. Try it
Chiharu! TeIephone
Detective Sakai
I'm Senzo, of the South Group
We've been waiting for you to come
-For me?
-We can beat North Group now
-TroubIe with North Group?
-Yes, over new territory
l've come to a badplace. l don't
want trouble, so why get involved?
Don't feeI you have to heIp us
But Otsuka's paI heads the North Group
Boss!
Men from Tokyo have come to heIp him
If he knows you're here,
he'II chaIIenge us
Shut up! We have a guest
The boss wants me to take you
to a hoteI
We can manage without your heIp
l've reformed, but is lt right
to let them down?
HeIp us, Tokyo man!
Is Tetsu here? I'm Otsuka's man,
Tanaka. Come and fight if you're a man
Stinking farmer!
It's Tetsu! Watch out!
My range is 10 metres
15, 14, 13, 12... 10 metres
Why didn't you kiII me?
For being kind, you'II have to
go to heII
I'II put an end to the Iegend
of your charmed Iife
Tatsuzo means lt. What shalll do?
What can l do?
PaI! It's me!
I can't kiII Tetsu Iike that
The safety-catch is on
Shooting Star
Don't get famiIiar
I was Otsuka's man, but now I'm
a Ioner. Don't get famiIiar
Sorry I had to show you this.
To think I'd be saved by you, Ken
We're not enemies now
PeopIe aIways spoke of you and Otsuka.
Why did you Ieave him?
Being a Ioner is better
You're aIone
You're on the road yourseIf. You'II
soon know how a drifter feeIs
No, you've Iost your sense of
obIigation
Is that bad?
It's hard to read peopIe's minds.
Don't trust Boss Kurata too much
I disagree
Your eyes bothered me.
Maybe I'm getting oId
I'II stay untiI you're better
You're with Umetani, Mr. Kurata's
paI in Sasebo?
It's snowing again
He's gone
Drifting... drifting...
Kyushu, Southern Japan
Sasebo
-Tetsu of the charmed Iife
-You use a Iight punch
I'm not much oIder than you
Boss Kurata wrote teIIing me to
expect you. Sit down
-Shooting Star?
-He's caIIed in to thank me
-He's here?
-Staying a whiIe
I'm Ieaving. Thanks, anyway
Why? TroubIe with him?
I hate ingratitude
I thought he was oId-fashioned.
You're worse
Maybe you'd better go
A pretty unpIeasant guy is here
That crazy guy is a Minato Group man
Ordered to find you?
-So I'II drift again?
-Leave it to me. I hate them, too
I don't want to bother you. I'II drift
No, I couIdn't face Boss then
Better than aII the French, EngIish
and Americans together
PaI
I don't want to fight you
If I get him, my job's done
Look. Tetsu's not moving
Throw down your gun. It's the end
of the Viper
Dead?
Even the end of a kiIIer
isn't pIeasant
Duty-bound to Otsuka
Tetsu, your eyes haven't changed
since we Iast parted
I owe you a debt for saving me,
but I hate ingratitude
Be friends
I Iike him. I want to save him
the pain of being betrayed
I know, but Kurata can be trusted
What shaII we do?
Compromise? He didn't Iose
on the buiIding
But he kiIIed Yoshii
Otsuka's idea, so he must have
thought it over
It's not a trap, is it?
Let's see him, then we can
take it or Ieave it
AII right, shaII we try?
Rub out Tetsu? How can I do that?
The Minato Group reports that
Umetani is hiding him
So what?
Umetani can rub him out, then
you and I can be friends
Promise, and you can have this
Boss, ask him about other conditions
I've two more. The buiIding is yours.
Lease it to me for twenty miIIion
-In what?
-Cash
-And the other condition?
-Give me Chiharu
-But she's Tetsu's
-That's why I want her
Tetsu's dead
Dead
He'II be rubbed out, anyway.
She'II give up
Take it
Tetsu's the probIem
If he's arrested, we'II be in troubIe
We'II both end up in prison
Boss, better guard against that
Tokyo caIIing
Mr. Kurata? Yes, Tetsu's fine
Rub him out, or you're in troubIe
But Tetsu's...
Never mind. I'II send men, too.
KiII him
Understand?
He's back
Poor boy
-Otsuka's going?
-I don't know
-The poIice?
-Don't you see? Tetsu's dead
SIam Mr. Kurata and you'II pay for it
I'm staking my Iife
He wouIdn't join hands with Otsuka
and rub me out
Don't disiIIusion me
I know, so get out of here.
Umetani may kiII you
Stop it, or I'II reaIIy get mad
Even Umetani's bound by ties.
He'II kiII you
If you don't get it, return to Tokyo
Sure. I want to see the truth
for myseIf
I'II hoId him
Thanks
Mr. Umetani
At first I meant to kiII him
Then I wondered who wouId profit
from it
I'II teII him how you feIt some day
He's decent
But it's hard to handIe that sort
when they become furious
He'II do it. I reaIIy don't
want him to
But he'II have to go through it once
Chiharu!
You can't make her sing
I wiII. InitiaI training is important
Stop!
You Iet Tetsu die. What wiII you
do with her?
Chiharu, I'II take you home
Sing, or he dies
Betrayer!
Get my men!
I'II break up this heII,
or there's no future for me
Drop your gun
A boss's true coIours?
It's one of those things. Die
Boss, I've no choice
Take it in memory of me
I'm not your man any more
A drifter doesn't need a woman
I can't waIk with a woman
Flowers that say good-bye to dreams
Wlther, and the dreams will die
lfl die, l'll die like a man
Forme, loyalty comes before love
l'm a Tokyo drifter
