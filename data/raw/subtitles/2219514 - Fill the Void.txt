It's not him.
Mr. Shtreicher?
Rivka Mendelman, good morning.
We can't find him.
Yes.
Thank you. Goodbye.
It's the dairy department.
A copy of his father.
You'll have to do a lot of washing.
Do not have a tissue?
Shira..
What do you think?
It's done, Esther.
It's happening.
When did you meet?
We haven't yet,
but I feel it. I know.
It was so strong
I want to scream it out.
You lack some discretion.
- I won't scream, but I'd like to.
Scream to the Lord.
Tell me what to say.
When will you meet?
- Next Monday.
Stay calm, first of all.
He doesn't need to know you 
feel so strongly. And then ...
Esther..
Do you need anything?
Should I call Yochay?
It's done.
Let's go home.
I think it's best to prepare
conversation topics.
So, if silence falls
you talk about school.
He'll certainly start talking
of his studies at the yeshiva.
Mother, the keys to the safe.
How much do you take?
- 3000.
Hi, Dad.
-Happy Purim.
Happy Purim.
-Mother is in the living room. I'll be right there.
Hi.
-Happy Purim.
I can't image how many 
people there are out there.
My darling.
Get ready, it's starting.
Shalom.
-Happy Purim.
Entry 10 people at a time.
Hello, Yossi, shalom

Happy anniversary.
Happy Purim.
- Happy Purim.
Happy Purim.
How can I help?
I'm married, I have 10 children:
4 pairs of twins
and 2 other small boys.
I started to marry them.
Greetings.
- Mazel tov (blessings).
They're all in good health?
- Yes thanks to God
How many males and females?
All sons.
- Mazel tov.
Hello.
- Greetings.
I don't know how to manage
two each time.
Two years pass
and two more come.
Happy Purim.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Happy Purim.
Good health to you.
- Cheers.
I'm getting married.
Greetings.
Amen.
I'm an orphan, but I work.
I teach reading.
I would like to buy her
jewelry as I should.
With joy. Happy Purim.
- Thank you. Happy Purim.
Happy Purim.
-Happy Purim.
How are you?
- Hi, Frieda.
I have some news.
I'm getting married.
I'm getting married, Shira.
What?
- Yes
To whom?
- Yosef Goodman in New York.
His father is the Rabbi's
third cousin.
I'm getting married.
- I can't believe it.
I told you, right?
When did you know?
-They landed last night.
We met from 19:00 till 22:15.
I could feel it. 
-What's he like?
I don't know.
Qhat do you mean?
- He's nice.
Mother, can you go out 
for a moment, please?
Frieda ...
You'll be next.
Amen.
No. I don't deserve you.
-Yochay ...
I'm not saying it often enough.
- You say that every Purim.
Why do I say this only on Purim?
My wife..
You are everything to me.
-Stop it, Yochay, you're drunk.
You are my Torah.
I love you.
She's ill.
I didn't know when I got married.
-What did she do?
She's mentally ill.
Another glass?
No more.
I'm failing.
With God's help,
salvation comes in a flash.
Happy Purim, Rabbi Shtreicher.
How can I help?
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Thank God..
- It's not enough.
Go to Goldberg,
Tell him I sent you.
Where were we?
Thank God,
we fixed orphan Frenkel,
but not a penny left.
It's ridiculous.
If you could give something,
that would be great.
Happy Purim.
- Happy Purim.
A word of Torah?
How's his daughter Shira,
with Miller?
It's not the right time, 
we'll talk later.
Rabbi Aaron,
engagements aren't for postponing.
We'll talk later. Happy Purim.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Happy Purim, Tel Aviv.
We want to wish you a Happy Purim.
Close the window.
Esther?
Are you ok?
Can you hear me? Answer me.
What happened?
What is it?
- Esther doesn't answer me.
No answer?
Break down the door.
(Aaron and Yossi saying
verses of effort)
No answer.
No answer.
She fainted.
- Are you ok?
Shira called the ambulance.
- Is she breathing?
I hope so.
- Is she breathing?
What's the number?
- 101.
Hold the door.
I can't reach them.
We need an ambulance.
Rashi Street, 64.
My sister. She is pregnant, the ninth month.
God will comfort you
among mourners in Zion and Jerusalem
and may you be saved from
any more pain.
Amen.
- Amen.
It's only a temporary separation.
This is what comforted me
when my wife died.
Are you a widower?
Since 9 years.
God will comfort you
among mourners in Zion and Jerusalem
and may you be saved from
any more pain.
Amen.
God will comfort you
among mourners in Zion and Jerusalem
and may you be saved from
any more pain.
Amen.
Let's hurry. We have an hour
for the tomb and then a circumcision.
May God comfort you.
- Amen.
I wish you comfort too.
With the help of heaven..
..Happiness for those who dwell
in thy courts..
..We enjoy the Good of your holy house
and your holy places..
The Lord is our God, who reigns forever
Lord save us..
..May he grow in the presence
of the Torah, the Hupa and good deeds..
Amen.
How can I help?
How do you help a defeated man?
And his daughter Shira?
- Not now.
Rabbi Aaron,
engagements aren't for postponing.
We conclude now
marriage will be in a year.
Let's wait a bit.
There is Yochay's mother.
How are you, Shira?
- Fine.
Welcome.
- Good to see you.
Mordechai.
Hey.
No.
I am the grandmother.
Little sweetie.
The boy needs..
- It has everything it needs.
How long do you 
want to wait, Rivka?
A year?
This is something you and I
don't have the right to decide on.
It's Yochay's choice.
I don't think Yochay
can already think of marriage.
It's coming.
Little by little.
Oh my God.
It's something that kills me.
They talked
2 weeks after Esther's death.
Then it was out of place,
but now ...
Who is it?
She became a widow six months ago.
Mother of two young children
and speaks Hebrew.
Where's she from?
From Belgium.
You can't take him to Belgium.
- I'm not doing anything.
I'm just proposing to Yochay.
He's the one to decide.
It's killing me.
Tell me what to do.
God, have mercy.
You can't propose to Yochay.
What should I do.
- Have mercy.
Come in.
How are you?
- Tired.
- Where's Mordechai?
Outside with Shira.
Mr. Shtreicher,
Rivka is a Mendelman.
More or less.
I'd like to dicuss a matter
concerning my daughter Shira.
Yes?
Yes, what is it?
The answer is no.
There's nothing to think about.
I can't talk now.
Anyway, thank you.
Greetings.
Are you okay?
Amen.
To me you're like a son,
so get straight to the point.
What do you think of marriage?
For now I don't intend to get married.
You're not a 19 yr old student anymore, 
you have to think about Mordechai.
Will you be hurt if I marry?
I'll manage. What matters most 
is you and your son.
I had no interesting offers.
Why not Shira?
Was that your idea?
What makes you think that?
I feel it's right.
It's a girl.
- She's 18 years old.
Who would be better for Mordechai?
It's not enough.
Is it better to marry a stranger?
- You're pressuring me.
Does she know?
- No one knows.
My son.
I feel comfortable here.
- Yes.
Good boy.
No, sweetie.
Give him to me, I'll take him.
Here you go.
There you are.
(Men sing a festive song in Hebrew)
Best wishes.
- Bless you.
What do you think?
Happy birthday.
- Best wishes.
You can see he's happy.
How can you tell?
What is it?
Nothing.
May you be the next one.
- Amen.
I'm glad you came.
All bachelors are idiots.
It's true.
How come no one 
chose a diamond like you yet?
I don't think I'm a diamond.
Greetings.
Whether you're the next one.
You think I don't have a life
because I'm not married?
I've never been married.
Then why do you cover your head?
The Rabbi told me.
So people won't ask me questions.
Get off me.
Stop.
Leave me alone.
What a beautiful boy.
We must decide now at Pinchas.
- Calm, have patience.
I'm tired of that. We need to make a move
before the Millers will change their minds.
You're upset. Calm down.
I have no patience.
- Wait untill we get home.
Amen.
I almost got married once.
- What? With whom?
Nachman.
He didn't take me in his arms. 
He was lame.
What happened?
- Nothing. I didn't like him.
Shalom. Is father or mother at home?
- Yes, both.
Mr. Shtreicher, 
what brings you here?
Is Rabbi Aaron at home?
- He's going to the synagogue.
Mr. Shtreicher,
I didn't have time..
Welcome.
-Shalom, Rabbi Aaron.
Can we talk?
- Of course.
The engagement of Shira..
It will happen gradually.
It's a madhouse.
It's not what I want.
I wish you well.
I wouldn't say so if I thought
they wouldn't fit together.
This won't bring Esther back.
You think I don't know that?
- Let it be.
I can't.
It's madness.
I'm going crazy.
I'm here, you can go crazy.
It kills me 
if he leaves for Belgium.
He doesn't want to.
- How do you know?
Isn't it obvious?
No.
I can not imagine
returning to an empty house.
We need to ask our daughter.
Please, Father.
It's useless.
What's wrong with Yochay?
No one is forcing you.
It's your decision.
You don't have to decide now.
Think about your decision.
You can say no right now.
- No.
You're pressuring.
- But don't you see?
Think, Shira'le.
He is Esthers husband,
You can't be.
We talked and he agrees.
Okay, enough.
We get it.
Why do not you let me marry
Pinchas Miller?
They changed their minds.
What?
-They've decided to quit the arrangement.
Why?
They are blind, Shira'le.
I don't know you.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
To school.
Come in.
Raise your hands children, well done.
Like this.
Again. Come on, jump.
Clap your hands.
Put your hands up.
Left, right.
That's right.
I'm sorry to hear
about your sister.
We were away when it happened.
How do you feel?
How is your mother?
- Not very well.
I'm so sorry.
Come on, girl.
Shlomit, you're tired?
Come on girl, jump with me.
Put your hands up. Just like that.
Very good.
I'm willing to meet with Yochay.
Why?
Maybe all this is happening
for me to marry him.
What's happening?
- The Millers don't want me anymore.
We don't not want to pressure.
Yochay is a good guy,
but you should make your mind up.
- I know, I ...
For the time being
I didn't decide anything.
No problem.
Arrange everything.
Esther told me
that if anything happened to her,
I should marry Yochay.
This year I'll uphold myself more.
You say that every year.
It's not easy to say.
I think the best thing
is to be honest.
I..
- What confuses you most?
I'm not confused.
Right.
Then what is this?
I don't know.
Are you afraid to be confused?
Are you not?
I discovered something.
What did you find?
You and I 
we can get married.
I'm Esther's little sister.
You're not so little anymore.
And you are beautiful.
What?
Why do you say that?
What, you're beautiful
or that you're not so little?
That's sufficient motivation 
for marriage ?
You need more reasons?
It's ok.
I thought you might be
a great mom for Mordechai.
I don't know how, but I feel
we'd be good together.
But Esther wanted
you to marry Frieda.
Esther wanted me
to marry Frieda?
Yes.
Who said that?
Esther.
That's what Esther..
- Esther is gone.
Why do you let me say
all these things?
I don't know. 
It wasn't on purpose.
I should have known.
- You were very cruel.
Out of respect, tell your parents
that's not the case.
- What happened?
- He wants to marry me.
What did you say?
Frieda is more suitable for him.
You said Frieda is more suitable?
You just stood there saying
Frieda is most suitable?
What where you thinking?
I've never heard such a thing.
Can I have a glass of water,
please?
How dare you, Aunt?
How dare you put Shira
in this situation?
A girl talks to a guy
about another girl?
We're decent people. 
Do you know how much you offended Yochay?
- Where did you get this insolence?
- Don't you see she doesn't want to marry him?
- Don't dare to meddle.
- Let me speak for a moment.
Apart from her being 
the next child in row
What other reason 
justifies this wedding?
Yochay is a great guy.
- He's old, he already has a son.
Shira is still a child.
- Stop it. Youre crossing the line.
Leave her to marry
with a man of her age,
one that can grow with her.
- Forget Shira, you hear me?
Stay away from her.
Or what?
I'm holding myself back.
Before I say 
things I will regret.
Happy Shabbat.
- Happy Shabbat.
I would like to go to the Rabbi,
Can I leave Mordechai here?
Sure, but come in first.
I need to make it in time..
- I said come in.
Happy Shabbat
- Happy Shabbat.
I'm going to see the Rabbi,
I brought Mordechai.
A song and I'm gone.
Shira, grab a plate.
- I've already eaten.
A little, sweety?
- No, thank you.
Aaron can also enter now.
What did you want to talk about?
I think you know about
the proposal from Belgium.
Yes, I know.
We'll leave for Belgium.
You've already met that woman?
- We met as children.
What is she like?
I don't remember.
Marry Frieda.
No. I can't.
- Why?
I don't know.
Tell me how to survive.
With a miracle.
What a tragedy 
has rained down on him, Yochay.
Ask heaven to give me strength.
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For what happened.
I know what happened to me, but to you?
Did I hurt you?
A lot.
What happened to you?
- To me, nothing.
Are you sure?
You're very close.
I could've been much closer.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Mother, what happened?
- It's over.
They leave for Belgium.
- It's not true.
Is it cold outside?
- No.
Give me the sweater.
He can't leave.
- There's no choice.
I'm going to marry him.
Shira, stop it.
- I'm serious.
I don't want to hear it.
- I'm serious.
Stop it.
- I said I would marry you.
Enough.
How many times 
do I need to repeat it?
Come in.
- Are you okay?
Please sit down.
- We need to see the doctor.
- Sit down.
It's time to put 
the cards on the table.
We don't know what'll happen tomorrow,
we postponed the question
for far too long.
We know it would be
the best solution for everone
if Frieda married Yochay.
She's very much like Esther,
Yochay said so himself.
And I proposed to him.
- Shira is even closer.
What are you doing, Aunt?
Have you no mercy?
Manners don't lead to marriages.
Yochay and Frieda should marry.
- Says who?
I'm telling you.
- But Yochay doesn't want it.
Frieda.
Frieda, wait.
I cant' take it anymore
all these humiliations,
I am a human being.
You're right, you don't deserve this.
- So respect me and leave me alone.
What's going on?
Dad and Yochay are talking.
Sit here.
- Hi.
- Good morning, Rabbi.
- Greetings.
- We're very close.
- Thank you.
Greetings from my wife.
- Good, glad to see you.
Why will you marry me, Shira?
For the same reasons you have.
Anything you'd like to ask me?
Now I can not think of anything.
Is something you want to ask me?
Why will you marry me?
- I told you.
You didn't say anything.
What do you want me to say?
What's going through your head.
This is the right thing to do.
Like you said,
I'll be a good mom to Mordechai.
I don't believe you.
- What's not to believe?
Mother will be near him.
Speak the truth.
How old were you
when you married Esther?
22.
Was it good?
Everything was new?
Were you excited to marry
the most beautiful woman in the world?
Answer me.
Was it wonderful to be
married the first time?
I'm giving up on this.
How is your wife?
It's not easy, but she's strong.
There is only one consolation:
When there is so much pain,
so much suffering,
we are very close to God.
- May God give us strength.
Amen.
But, really.
Excuse me Rabbi,
outside there is an old lady
who wants to see you, right now.
She has to wait,
I'll receive her in a minute.
How are you?
- Fine, thanks to God
And Mordechai?
He's a healthy baby.
I said I have to speak to him right now..
About what?
Yochay and my daughter Shira
want to get married.
Now.
She's crying. She won't stop.
Tell her to come.
How can I help you?
I thought the Rabbi
could help me. Nobody wants to.
The custodian of the synagogue
wouldn't let me enter.
I have to buy a new furnace
I do not know which one to choose.
You have no one else
to ask for help?
No.
A child? A relative?
I have no one.
There are 5 stoves, 2 different compartments
with a separation to cook Kosher.
Please, lady,
have a look yourself.
Isn't it a bit too low?
Do you think it's too low?
The oven I had before
was higher.
We can try to lift it.
It seems too low.
How does your daughter 
feel about the engagement?
It is not a matter of feelings.
It's only a matter of feelings.
There is a job to do
and I want everyone to be satisfied.
Shira'le.
Rabbi Nachman of Breslev says:
"Blessed is he who throughout his life
speaks truth to the Lord."
Just now.
Give me the strength to get up, Father.
Give me the strength, I can't.
I can't do it alone,
I need your help.
Hold my heart, Father,
I feel like it's exploding.
I feel this exploding pain.
I can't stand it, have mercy.
Help me, Father.
Give me the strength, please.
Give me the strength and I'll get up.
Give me the strength. Power.
Give me the strength.
I need your help.
I can't go on alone.
Come.
I'm not angry with you.
It seems the opposite.
You're right.
Mother, tell me what to do.
You do not have to do anything, dear.
Frieda is getting married.
- What?
Frieda is getting married.
What happened?
- Frieda is getting married.
To whom?
- You won't believe it.
What?
- You won't believe it.
I'm so happy.
- Mother..
With ...
- With whom?
With Shtreicher.
- Oh come on.
What makes you think it's Shtreicher?
- He was proposed to. Come.
To Shtreicher?
Bless you.
(Men sing a festive song in Hebrew)
Bless you.
- Thank you.
All this is real?
- Of course.
I can't believe this is happening.
So you play the accordion.
Yes.
Why the accordion?
- Because of my grandmother.
Do you like that instrument?
- I don't know any other instruments.
I have no sense of rhythm.
I'm sorry, what kind of girl
do you have in mind?
Like me, full of energy,
passionate,
who knows how to run a household.
I'm sorry.
What kind of house do you want?
A real house.
I don't want to lie.
Good evening.
- Goodbye.
Good night. Good luck.
I can't read the signs.
If only I could understand
What you're trying to say.
Are you drunk?
What do you want?
Know that the Lord loves you.
It's not what I feel.
It doesn't suit you.
- What doesn't suit me?
Self-pity.
Go to sleep, baby.
I'm not a little girl.
- Try.
What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.
Something true.
I don't know what to..
- You don't want to.
I have nothing to say.
- What are you afraid of?
You're welcome.
- Yes.
You can't tell me ...
- Stop it. Say it.
What do you want from me?
- I'm afraid to die.
Why would you die?
- Because I'm bad.
You don't know me.
Look at me.
You aren't bad.
Shira, daughter of Rivka Mendelman.
Miss Mendelman, how may I help you?
Can you taka a message to the Rabbi?
- Write it fast.
I have to go attend the afternoon prayer.
Good morning.
- I'm going to prayer, come back later.
Alright.
Rabbi.
- Good morning.
How are you?
- Fine, thanks to God.
Good morning.
- Lady.
Please.
Please come in.
Good morning, Aaron. How are you?
Fine, and you?
- Fine.
Good morning.
- Come and join us.
Mazel tov.
Mazel tov.
Happy Birthday.
Thank you.
May you be happy.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Happy birthday.
You look beautiful.
Bless you.
We'll be fine together.
I know that we'll be fine.
Have I already told today
that I love you?
My love.
My sweety.
