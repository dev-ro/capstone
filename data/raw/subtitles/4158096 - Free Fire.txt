Move your fat ass.
Shut the fuck up, Bernie. My fucking
head is about to explode here.
That guy shouldn't messed you up.
Oh, I ever see him again,
he's dead.
Not so pretty now, huh,
pretty boy?
I look like I try to fuck a
reluctant panda bear.
Hell, you did worse than that.
I don't like fucking talk about it.
Didn't happen. Okay?
- Where the fuck are they?
- It's okay, we have ten minutes here.
Oh Frank, stop giving up
like an old lady, will ya?
I just one everyone go home
happy from this deal.
Exactly, do you hear that, Frank?
Fucking hate the shit.
I'm gonna take as him.
The bag of charm has lost its charm.
Do you have word apparently?
Look at this fucking mullian.
Man her asshole brother's got his feet
so fine to the fucking table.
The way you should do,
you should just tell him to leave.
I can't man,
since all part of the deal.
Man, I hate houseguests.
Yesterday he put my shoes
out on the porch and polished them.
I mean, what the fuck
does that even mean?
- Oh, Jesus do you got any headache pills?
- I got smack.
Talking about a fucking sledgehammer
to crack a nut.
There you go.
Where your lady's at?
- I haven't been home yet.
- Alright.
- She is pregnant.
- Oh, shit. Again?
Considering how much you hate her,
you sure seem to fuck her a lot.
Where are we going?
So what's the deal with you and Frank?
It's Frank's job
to make sure no one gets in my way.
And it's my job to make sure that Frank,
doesn't get in his own way.
<font color=#FFFF00>Subtitled by Asmita/BioHapzard.</font>
- Hey, Saint Francis, what's going on?
- Get over here.
Where the fuck have you been?
My sister worried a second about you.
Don't worry about it. When she's
pregnant, she's to call a cop.
- Geez.
- What happened to your eye?
Listen son, don't you show me off.
I'm trying to help you here,
giving opportunity, bring you in.
- Why you polished my shoes?
- What?
I got work gloves.
Come here, Justine...
You're not FBI?
Are you?
- I'm IIFM.
- What?
In it for Myself.
- Alright?
- Fuck.
- Fucking sort it right.
- Jesus, Frank.
Fucking pull off man.
Get over here.
Straight up, you look like a
fucking hunchback in Notterdam.
- Fuck.
- Beautiful balls.
- I introduce yourself to the lady.
- Sure. Stevo.
- Justine.
- Nice to meet you.
Charlie's missing an angel tonight huh?
My God.
Beautiful...
Great.
So Stevo,
where did you get that vehicle?
Oh the vehicle, that's cool.
I did exactly what I was told.
That's a first day.
Hey Justine, need some of that brown stuff
you girls like to try all over your face.
- What do you mean like powder?
- Yeah, yeah.
I feel a little
conspicuous with the black eye.
Yes, Stevo,
I'll do it for you.
- I'll help you out here. Oh whose that..?
- Hey, careful, careful, Chris.
- It's bruised.
- I'll do it, it's fine.
I will fucking do it.
So where's your guy then?
We didn't come 3000 miles for the view.
Here he is.
I'll handle it.
Whoa, whoa..
Slow down, now sweetheart.
Christopher?
- So, What do you think?
- She'll give him the...
- Tell me like it's jumper.
- Thousand Apologies.
I hate it when people are tardy.
This is Ord.
It's good to meet you boys.
Thanks for coming out.
Maybe later.
You didn't masturbate before
you got here, did you?
What?
Told you, I don't work with anybody
who's carrying a loaded weapon.
So if you need time
to find yourself a dark corner..
I'm just saying relax.
It's all good.
If you wouldn't mind, as we agreed upon,
I'll check for wires.
Got a gun.
Good. Soon, you guys
will have even more.
Come on, big guy.
Uh-huh.
You know where I am from boy,
we would be half way up there by now.
Would you hold your makeup
there for me? Thank you.
- Alright there, Smokey.
- You smell good.
Thank you.
That's your mother.
Ok, no wires, if no one listen again,
because we're all friends.
The fag and the retards are
an interesting choice of muscle,
to bring to the party.
- Look there.
- Aw.
You know what, fuck this small talk.
Let's buy some guns eh?
Alright, step into my office.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm leaving a trail of breadcrumbs.
So what Justine tell
you about this people?
Why don't we hear from you, fella?
Yeah, I appreciate that
you're a serious guy,
I mean 'Fuck Britain' and in all that.
But you're on a different level now..
The guy who represents
this merchandise,
his lounge's bigger than
your whole fucking country.
As big as your fucking mouth.
Tell me Frank, is it true, you people
live in houses with mudfloors?
I'm just saying. You know my ancestors
probably ate raw Indians and fucked goats.
Nah. Don't thing they
were that advanced.
- Oh, God Damn it.
- Watch yourself there.
- Look at this shit.
- It's a real fucking palace.
Hey, beggars can't be
choosers, Cinderella.
I wonder what kind of factory it was.
What ever it made,
nobody wants it now!
It's cold.
Think this is cold sweetheart?
You should try Hollywood in February.
Freeze the tits of a bra switch.
So fucking dirty.
Who turned the lights on?
Only thing a girl needs to stay warm
in Los Angeles is a flexible outlook.
I'm not talking about your Hollywood.
I'm talking about the real Hollywood.
Hollywood, County Down, Northern Ireland.
You guys got a Hollywood
too? That's great.
Carry that shit there..
That's what I like about this business.
You could be financially rewarding and you
can still learn something new every day.
- Stop your ABC son.
- Oi, introductions?
Come out, come out
where ever you are!
Vernon, why don't you come join us?
The gang's up here.
Here he come.
Vernon is in the blue suit.
- Who is the other fella?
- Martin, he was a panther..
But it didn't work out.
Vernon was misdiagnosed as a child genius.
He never got over it.
- What is he now?
- Let me do the talking. Eh boy?
An international asshole.
Vern, these are the boys
from across the pond.
Oh, everyone is from somewhere, eh?
Justine, how are you, doll?
As gorgeous as ever.
Well, you've put on a bit of weight.
- Did somebody pin at you?
- Fuck off.
Good, still a chance.
- Fuck is that accent?
- I think it's Swiss or something.
- Austrian.
- I've had days with Austrian.
What do you say we check out the march?
That's why we're here.
She's a bit shy.
So, you will be be pleased to know...
That I have all truck load of these
gorgeous dolls, just outside...
and they all looking
for dance partners..
It's not what we wanted.
You little bit rude, eh?
Presenting a march
and you start chipping the bird there?
- He says it's not what he ordered.
- Fuck, really?
- Let me explain.
- What did you order?
We ordered M16s.
Ever heard of them?
Now this is an AR70.
Different weapon.
It's not what I ordered.
You teach your boys some manners.
Learn a thing or two from the English.
- Keep your shit together.
- Martin, stay out of this.
I'm not running a
fucking pizza delivery service.
You want the weapons
or you don't want the weapons?
- Look...
- They're assault rifles.
Justine! You said 'rifles', doll.
They are fucking rifles. What do you want?
This is what that's available.
You are not gonna find anything else of
this quality or consistency on the market.
Not in the numbers you need
or in the time that you've got.
He has a point.
Where from?
Still with the questions.
You curious fucking eh?
We're gonna get on your knee.
You're so fucking curious
about the world.
Look they're...
They won't be missed alright?
Alright, take a first spin.
Use the mic.
No manners again.
So simple.
It's loaded, Martin.
Just a fucking 'please'.
Like fucking when unloaded.
- What are you doing in front of a client?
- Keep together.
You want something done,
you do it yourself mate.
Amen brother.
I think we got off on a
little bit of a bad fitting there.
I think what we need to do is just
start a fresh start.
I'm gonna be the gentleman
in this relationship...
And.. I'm gonna check in a free box
of lube because she likes to run wet.
Whoa, slow down for a minute.
Public safety announcement...
While the rifle's hot, I'm gonna
pull my pistol out. Nothing personal.
Knock yourself out, spark.
Okay, just, try not to hit
any of the metal work.
I don't want get any of those
bling burn on my new...
- ..Suit.
- Sorry. What was that?
This is from Savile Row...
Well I don't know about you guys
but I got one thing
Vern's merchandise is a real gas.
My gas, is you're whatever
you're paid to be pal.
See what you did?
Good.
I will overlook at this time.
Mazel Tov.
So, let's open Pandora's box eh?
Alright.
- My...
- Associate.
Associate, yeah, will do the count.
See if it's all there.
It's better this way.
The machine don't lie.
Gordon? Are you sure that radio was on?
- Of course, it's fucking on.
- Good cause I don't wanna miss my queue.
What the fuck are you gonna do?
High kick your way in there..?
With the fucking top hat and cane?
- And plus, it's my queue, ok?
- Whatever.
I'm just ready, you know?
And I want Vern to know that.
Vern doesn't give
two fucks about what you want.
Verny can't even see you.
You're that small.
Plus you need to wash them knuckles,
or they are gonna get infected.
Fuck man.
You like John Denver?
- I must admit I never tire looking at it.
- I never tire looking at you doll.
So what do you know?
It's all there, on the nose.
- That's heart warming.
- And you can keep the case as well.
- Yeah, I was going to.
- Thanks.
- Real nice teeth.
- He looks like a fucking cock jockey..
Yeah.
- You can bring the girls in.
- And away..
Ok, so, Vern's boys
are gonna drive the car in,
they are gonna put the crates in.
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- Grandpa, you gotta relax.
They are gonna put the guns right here,
when they're done they're gonna leave,
then Tweedledee and Twedeldoom can load
them up into your little clown car.
You're the first one I'm gonna take
down if this goes side, big lad.
- Probably good idea grandpa.
- I reckon..
Sorry, you're just, you're moulting.
Bigfoot.
So before we head home,
do you wanna go dinner with me?
Oh wow,
I didn't to that in.
Oh I mean, I know we
just met and all but...
It's unlikely that I will be
over here again before too long,
so I thought...
we can maybe.
- Have a plate.
- When you put it like that,
It doesn't sound like a
very good investment.
Yeah, fuck it.
Forget I said that.
I will.
Oh fuck it.
Fuck!
- Come here.
- What's in there with you?
Holy motherfuck.
That's the guy who
attacked me last night.
- That's the guy, guy in the pub.
- It's not good, it's not good.
Master keys.
Okay..
Now come in.
You know what this is?
This is the key. The key to
victory for you and the Irish.
A van full of AR70's. Fantastic.
Just let it go, buddy.
We didn't wanna get in the way.
Didn't wanna get in the way.
What are you on holidays or something?
I'll pay you a 100 bucks to help with
the van. Get over there. Alright?
- Ok?
- Sure.
- Sure.
- I really thought that...
- Just do it.
- Sure.
You can't fucking go there.
You're gonna be so happy with these
weapons you're gonna come back for more.
Alright, get those boxes done.
It will be like my bird
begging for more.
- Yep. I've got it.
- Come guys come.
For future reference
let's not drop the automatic weapons.
- I've never been to Ireland.
- You what?
I said I've never been to Ireland.
You should go my land there.
They will love you over there.
- Perfect.
- Fuck still more?
Shit, I didn't know this was many.
I think you might owe me a
bit of extra boodle, eh?
One two Three...
Hey, come here.
- I mingling, what the fuck?
- What about the ammo, back at the truck.
- Oh yeah, I am sorry.
- Watch where fucking thing is.
I think that just saying
"no" is another reflex.
Yeah.
- Fuck it.
- Stupid.
No, we're not giving that mate.
- The Irish went for the AR70's.
- You are man man.
We give the M16's to the Libyans.
Vern and Lynn baby.
We should probably lock it up.
Just in case they see it.
I think we could, we could probably
both use a drink after this.
Yeah, that would be nice.
- Thanks mate.
- Yeah, you're right.
Ok, just, don't let them see you,
just do it subtly.
As soon as they done picking.
- Oh God. Jesus.
- What happened?
- I got a splinter.
- Let me see that.
Vern, the fucking learn.
- You deal with this fucking guy all day.
- Hold still, let me take it out with this.
Fuck off.
A fucking splinter?
Are you serious?
Sorry, boss.
Harry distracted me.
- I just suddenly a little bit of sick.
- Really, really?
'Sympathy' is in the dictionary
between 'shit' and 'syphilis' son.
Get the fuck over there.
You make me look stupid.
Three birds in a nest.
Do your puking when you're walking.
Go go go.
Alright.
You open up the rest of them?
There it is, huh?
- There is still, we'll lock it.
- Yeah, open the rest of them.
- You are fucking kidding.
- No.
- There's three in every box.
- Good.
There's ten boxes.
Thirty, like we agreed.
Vern, we covered this.
Transparency, remember?
Okay, okay.
Harry, open them all.
The customer is always right.
You are not very trusting, Irish?
I'm English, but English South African.
It's different. Trust not your thing, eh?
- Son of a fucking...
- Hey, hey, hey..!
What the fuck?
Come here, you fucking junkie.
I'll fuck you up again,
you fucking piece of shit.
- Stop the fuck down.
- Leave it.
- Blah blah, you fucking Neanderthal.
- Alright, Stevo.
...big deal.
Just calm that little dog.
FYI, your breath stinks shit
and you got a serious case of...
- I do not know where to kick..
- Come here.
Eat what you fuck..
- Hold on.
- Stop for Christ sake.
- Get up fucking cocksucker.
- Hey, hey hey.
We got the money,
the deal is done, no use.
What are you fucking doing
you fucking cunt?
Chris, I swear to God,
you're a waste of fucking...
- Unprovoked.
- It was uncalled for.
- Took me on the, unprovoked.
- I know I know, does it hurt?
No, doesn't hurt.
I am from Africa, man.
Africa is not for sissies.
Fuck. I don't even feel it.
But it's the principle doll.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, fuck ok.
- It's alright, I got a handkerchief.
- Ok, ok.
What the fuck's going on?
Let them deal with it.
You finally deal with me.
Alright..
- Little bit of a news flash.
- Please.
Harry here says that..
Junkie Joe over there did
some pretty last night.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Alright, listen, his name is Steven.
There is something wrong with him, okay?
Apologies.
Don't say that dirty
name around here. Ok?
Ok, alright. The suspense is killing me.
What did Steven do?
That fucking junkie, came on my cousin
last night at the hollow-queens.
And when she wouldn't suck his
fucking dick, he bottled her.
- You've got to be kidding me.. What?
- I'm as serious as fucking cancer.
She is scarred man,
permanently and she is 17.
- Hang on. Is this true, Gordon?
- It's unfortunate, but it's true.
The place erupted like
fucking Vesuvius man.
There is not a stick of furniture
left in that place.
If you were to walk on
hollow-queens tomorrow night
with his head on a fucking stick,
you'd be a hero man.
Why would you say that?
What are you doing?
You're just making it worse.
Everybody take the... ok?
Just calm the fuck down..
Now listen here.
We would like to leave
with our money...
and I'm sure that you boys would
like to leave with the weapons soon.
This is not good for business.
Bringing AR70s to an M16 deal
is not good for business.
Neither is bringing a sex pest.
It's under control doll.
I got this.
The bird has a point.
We would like to trust you,
but we can't because your
boy has been disrespectful.
- Alright. Fair enough.
- Okay?
Just give me a minute.
Enough.
- You all right, Chris?
- Out of the way.
He's doing the right thing.
Jesus Christ.
Get the fuck off me.
Why don't you fucking
tickle him to death?
You fucking pound a woman.
Is that your thing?
Is that your fucking thing Stevo?
I swear on my wife's life...
He bottled her Doll. I never do that.
I will never lay my hands on a woman.
I know. No.
You never have.
You gotta believe me Frank.
He's confusing me with some
other handsome fucker.
Right, Seriously?
As God is my witness.
I did not bottled that slut.
- Right, fuck!
- Frank, please.
Swear to sweet Jesus.
Look he is family, Chris alright?
So I should be the one...
- No, Frank.
- Fucking telling you.
Do you understand me? I'm going
to fucking bury you in a grave.
- Piece of shit you are.
- You got it then.
- They're taking care of it now.
- Enough, they have done it.
Alright.
Steven is being reprimanded.
Alright?
He's gonna pay for your cousin's
hospital bills.
He's gonna write a
sincere letter of apology.
That's great.
That's great.
He's paying for the bills
and a letter in his blood.
- In his own fucking blood,
- if it needs be.
- Are you kidding me man? A fucking letter?
- Can we just get back...
Maybe she doesn't read.
Maybe she wants a drawing.
Like a remorseful pony.
- She can fucking read Ord.
- Guys stop. You wanna do this?
Back off. Calm down.
Steven is going to apologies.
- Let him do it?
- I'm calm.
Man to man.
About last night.
I'm real sorry.
- There you go. That's great.
- There you go.
I am really sorry.
I'm real sorry, guys.
Because I came so hard
in your cousin's mouth...
I think I knaked some of her
fucking teeth out.
You'll have to pick that out of a
fucking stools..
At the fucking hospital.
- Make him on.
- Fucking cocksuckers.
- Shut that motherfucker up.
- You said he's gonna Apologies?
- What was that?
- Alright?
- How many times have I told you?
- Just clear provocation.
- Just cool it, Harry. Ok?
- Calm down harry.
Let go.
- Pop one of them in your fucking mouth.
- Fuck off back to Austria.
- Big fucking mouth on a little lad.
- Muzzle that.
The fuck is wrong with you?
You bring a junkie fucking...
What are you talking?
You know nothing about the lad.
You're already making it worse.
Now Shut the fuck up.
- Huh? Who gives a shit anyway?
- What the fuck do you have the gun for?
- Hey!
- Behave yourself alright?
- No, harry harry.
- Suck on this.
- I got it under control.
- You control your fucking man.
Come here, you fucking cocksucker.
- Fuck.
- I have been shot.
I've been shot.
He shot me.
I have got you.
Come on.
- Fuck!
- Barely nicked you.
You're gonna be okay.
It's mostly the suit.
Is the bullet in their too?
It's just a flick
through the shoulder pad.
My fucking suit.
Ord, my gun's jammed.
It's usually so reliable man..
Dust got in there.
Here, take it.
Don't shoot.
The deal is off.
Just have to wait for him
to show me his little face.
I've got it.
Cocksucker.
- He's still moving Vern.
- Eh?
You freaking bastards.
Chris is hit, Frank.
- No no. They shot my boy.
- Oh shit.
Martin, you bring that

Stevo? Stevo you alright?
Fuckers.
You okay, Stevo?
Chris, you alright?
- Frank! Let's get out of here, Frank.
- Shut the fuck up.
- You alright?
- I'm hit, but I'm good.
I am not leaving the case
with the boodle out there.
Of course not.
- Ord, cover me, I am going for the boodle.
- Wait, you don't wanna do that.
Fuck that.
Stop fucking shooting mate.
- You okay, Vern?
- Shot me man. I am shot.
- Vern shut up.
- Fuck you Chris..
Ord, what's happening?
Please, nobody do anything.
Stay back sweetheart.
Fuck, fuck. I'm running.
Nobody shoot.
- Stay down please, Vern.
- Not gonna happen, Ord.
- It's really heavy.
- Come on, load for, load for Vernie.
- Vern, stay down.
- It's too late. I have been insulted.
Let me get him.
Oh fuck, holy Jesus.
There we go.
God damn it.
Now we are cooking.
Hey Ord, bet you thought
you were too handsome to get shot.
I'm just impressed you haven't needed
a nap yet Francis.
Martin, look at me. You're gonna
be okay. Just say something.
What the fuck?
Gordon, over here.
Gordon, you alright?
What the fuck is that?
Who's shooting that?
Frank?
Who the fuck is shooting at us now?
- You good?
- What the fuck was that?
Sounds like a fucking rifle.
Move back.
- What the fuck?
- Redeem yourself and Get that case.
You get the fucking case, asshole.
Fuck you man.
I forgot which side I'm on.
Oh fuck, fuck.

Let's try something.

Go for the case.
No, what are you doing?
Not that case.
Hang on.

You cheaters bring a sniper?
Not with us.
He's not with us.
- Sounds like a fucking Garand.
- Someone find a carbine down here.
Vern, your friend needs serious help.
He will have to wait.
I'm a bit pre occupied right now.
-
Alright, little wallflower,
don't be shy. Come out and play.
Fuck.
- Give me the fucking gun.
- Give me that fucking...
- Just give it.
- Never.

Bernie, get up.
Quit your fucking whining, Stevo.
You fucking Neanderthal.
You fucking cocksucker.

Your Rolex is a fake.
Do not do this to me Bernie.
You wanna make me tell you mother?
I hate these fucking freelance jobs.
- You're gonna maybe fucking puke, Stevo.
- Shut the fuck up, man.
I'm gonna fuck kick his back,
fucking cocksucker.
- You're fucking dead, you fuck.
- Piece of shit.
This is legit.
It's worth 700 pounds..
- I'm telling you Vern it's a fake.
- I don't want your fucking watch.
Fuck me.
Those bastards have fucking..
It's a Shame for what they have done today.
I know I speak for everybody
when I express my sympathy to Steven,
for the loss of his special friend...
Fuck Steven man.
He started the whole thing.
- He shot the boy.
- I'm not dead.
- I'm just regrouping.
- What they've done today!
That's why you're a fucking angel man.
You're fucking angel sent from heaven,
that's what you are.
Anyway, I'm sure
Bernie's off to a better place.
Maybe he'll even make something
of himself down there.
I'm fucking grieving here.
I'm coming for you, man.
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.
You fuckin try,
you cocksucker.
- Cover me. I need to come over.
- Fine, Vernon.
- We need to strategize.

Fuck off..
Alright, I'll mark you as present
on the roster.
Justine?
- Here.
- Good girl. I like your style.
God damn dusts playing on my allergies.
- Shut the fuck up, Gordon.
- Fuck you Harry.
You will always be in
my thoughts Bernie.
They will never take
away the good times.
Some one just hit my head.
I am just...
Just a little bit, a scratch.
It's nothing.
Chrissy.
You remember that time Frank...
Was so drunk he stripped
down to his wife
Kieran wake and cried over the coffin
like a baby?
Oh you fucking asshole.
No comment.
That was the last time he had a drink.
Right, Frank?
Frank, you're an alcoholic?
Recovering..
Somebody gonna tell me,
who invited these gatecrashers?
Yeah, who were those
gatecrashers, Vern?
Steave, Stevo.
How badly?
Well come over for fuck's sake.
I bet the fuckers are over there.
Fucking chocolate teapot.
How badly?
Fuck you Frank.
I think your friend Vern is cheap
to pay for good shooters.
They couldn't be with Vernon.
Must have been some of the guy who went
over the deal and set it a chance.
Fucking Stevo, on his
big fucking mouth.
What the fuck is Chris
doing with Justine?
- She's stitching though his wounds.
- Vern, go shoot him.
- Stop. I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die You're gonna be fine.
I just gonna check on Frank.
What are gonna do
when you get out of here...
You find the first restaurant,
and I'll meet you there.
Alright?
They're playing us. Ok?
She's on their side,
and these marks
are with them.
Yea, but Vern, one of them shot her..
Or we shoot her?
You have got two choices.
One, you just strike them,
with your bad in the horse, and I'll leave.
What?
Or two you kill all of these
motherfuckers, and I'll leave.
It's good time
to bring up our contract.
For the amount of money
that we agreed on,
there were no
extenuating circumstances like this.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
How can you talk about money
at a time like this?
Get me an ambulance.
I know that voice.
We can't leave here empty-handed.
Where the fuck is Leary
when you need him?
Howard Mathison?
Ord, if I'd known you were there on
this, I would not have taken the job.
That geriatric reprobate
must have been retired.
- What are you doing?
- I need help. You have no idea.
Protecting our asses Vern.
Wooden boxes don't stop bullets.
College fees, the medical bills.
Plus Rita left me.
I hooked up with this Asian chick.
She cleaned me out.
Howard, I am gonna stack the bodies of
your eleven children on top of each other.
And burn them onto your lawn if you
don't tell me who hired you right now.
Tell us, Howard.
It's good. It's good.
That's what I'm paying you for.
- Do not listen to him. He's not the boss.
- Fuck you junkie.
Is the Junkie's still fucking alive?
I am no rat.
I'm gonna die anyway.
Since it's you, Ord...
I will tell ya.
It was...
My guys.
Fucking made it.
Howard is done talking.
Ord, I'm a feeling light headed..
I think I'm loosing too much blood.
Relax. Didn't even
hit an artery.
You're fine,
You got at least hour and a half.
It's the "golden hour and a half.
It's the rule.
How long has it been?
- Ord.
- What?
We are here for the guns alright?
You are here for the money.
Let Justine get out.
What are you doing?
She makes contact
with our respective people.
They come find us,
everyone's happy.
- Yeah, she can leave.
- No, what are you doing?
Good.
Justine, you are good to go.
- Thank you.
- Just go.
Alright.
I'll do it if Vernon promises
not to shoot me in the back.
- She's making it personal, man.
- Promise her.
Cross my heart, doll.
I shot that guy.
It's a death penalty in Massachusetts.
Yeah, I vote we barbecue
this whole fucking place.
There is more blood in the floor here
than a sausage factory man.
Do you think this is a fucking
senate committee? You don't get a vote.
- Fuck you.
- Shut up.
She is a snake in the grass.
Look at that, I told you.
She's escaping.
Wake up and smell the re-coffee Ord.
There is a phone in this building.
If there's a phone,
I can call the boys.
You're a fucking dead man, Vernon.
She's firing back.
I told you she's on their side.
Because you shot at her, Vern.
- A pushy woman isn't sexy, Justine.
- Chrissy thinks they are!
You come back here, Justine.
Justine and Chrissy sitting in a tree.
I will shoot you in the fucking head.
I wash my fucking hands of you.
Alright?
- I know what you're up to, Justine.
- Fucking maniac. I shoot you myself.
- Nail her, Gordon.
- Ok, boss.
There's a promotion
in it for you boy.
You fucking turncoat.
You fucking started this whole thing,
it's your fucking fault.
- Ord, stop it mate.
- What are we doing now?
- Think you're a big man?
- What the fuck? Stop. Stop!
Come on.
Boys, knock it off.
What the fuck is this?
You gotta help me on this..
Get this fucking loaded up.
You are a fucking kid,
you're a fucking baby.
- Stevo, go check the radio.
- Fucking hell, I do.
Move to that side and give him cover.
Make sure she gets out of there,
you hear me? Make sure she gets out.
- Ord, stop it.
- Stop.
Ord, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Ord, come back here.
Come back here right now.
You sneaky fucker.
Get out of here woman for Christ sake.
I am going.
I just shot Ord.
He's gonna fucking kill me, man.
You smell like perfume.
That's beard oil.
- Do it Frank.
- Can't get a clear shot out of.
Go Ord, nail him, boy.
What are you doing, Vern?
You making a new suit over there?
You, Chrissy come on.
Ah, my fucking leg.
Did you see that?
That was me.
Fuck it up.
I didn't see Dusty.
You know why?
Because it fucking happened to me.
That was fucking awesome.
You are a fucking hero.
Does anyone care
what happened to me by any chance?
Save it for your fucking autobiography.
I like your cardboard armor..
It's protection from infection.
Frank, one of us needs to
get to this fucking phone..
I will do it.
- Rhodesian Special Forces trick.
- No shit.
I am more likely to die from the germs,
infecting the wounds, than any bullets.
Well, I guess,
you're covered.
You'll be fine now,
you got about...
Got about an hour twenty,
before you're in trouble with that wound.
And I gotta get to that phone.
Is everybody like you,
where you come from?
Vern is a rare mysterious jewel.
Feast your eyes, boy.
Watch and learn,
then go back to your miserable life.
Alright, I'll see you later Vern.
Where are you running off to Frank?
We just getting started.
Ord, give us a head mate.
It's me.
Justine, stay there.
Fuck.. what the fuck!
- Martin.
- The bullets.
The keys.
Go. Grab them now.
Move, move.
Jesus.
Stop shooting,
you bastards.
So, Ord, are you gonna
go pat that man's body?
Ten Grand.
Fuck!
Why not twenty?
We leave an IOU for Vern.
I'm sure He'll understand.
I see him.
I see Frank.
He's going for the phone.
He is winning.
Frank's ok?
- Why do you care, huh?
- I've cut his wing.
Alright, I'm gonna go out there.
I gotta get the keys so I can open
the van and get the bullets man.
Steven?
So that's what a fucking
brain looks like.
Oh, fuck!
Man, I thought you were fucking dead.
Get the fuck off me.
You got shot in the head man.
Where the fuck am I?
Party Marty.
I know you.
- Come on man.
- Get the fuck out of there.
I just want my money.
It's okay,
I am not shooting.
No, stop running.
Jesus.
Where's the fucking money?
Safe man, I put it in
the fireman's fund.
Justine...
Justine!
Don't leave me in the dark, baby!
- Think she made it?
- Yeah, Of course she did.
Fucking stop.
Howard, you up there?
Yo, come down man, it's cool.
I know you fucked it all up.
What's your gun doing here man?
Howard!
I'm not your pet Vern.
What are you doing all over there man?
It was a simple fucking plan.
You fucked it up.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Give me a second,
I'm just gonna reload.
Give me my money.
- Don't do it man.
- No?
- You know where the money is?
- It's right there.
Okay? Look,
it's all good.
That beautiful.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Alright, everybody hold your fire...
Until I find out this motherfucker
is dead this time.
Poke him in the eye.
See if he flinches.
You're scared.
I can feel it.
Look, I just want you to know...
Before I do this for Vern,
I have been, right where you're now.
I have scrambled around
in some lousy job...
I made president sacrifices...
Only to have some fucking parasite
turn up in the last minute...
and take all the credit.
That's why I appreciate the odds.
If it wasn't for them...
Then all the doing,
it's just this.
Fucking shot me.
- You seem like a nice girl.
- We can't all be nice girls.
God, no.
Get of me.
You fucking shot me again.
You dropped this.
Congratulations.
Hopeful Americans will
receive a free lifetime
suppy of pork-lings,
premier ground meat.
All you have to do to
claim your prize...
Stevo, you alright, yeah?
I gotta go check on Frank.
Keep an eye out, alright?
You stay here you stay awake.
Tell you what?
Have a fucking cigarette.
Chrissy and Stevo..
Fucking cigarette.
Remember Stevo,
stay awake for me, huh?
Because when you go to sleep,
you're dead.
- Yeah?
- Ok.
Good man.
Men.
Wait.
I don't think so.
I see you,
you fucking hiddy.
Hello? Sandy?
- This is me. Where is Leary?
- He didn't show up.
It's fucking Chris, Sandy.
He's meant to be here.
I'm fucking here. Where is Leary?
Look for fucking Brendan.
Tell him I'm sorry.
Oi, here, Leary.
Leary, up here, boy.
Ah, fucker.
Holy shit.
Come on there, big man.
Fuck off, you freak of nature.
- Stay the fuck down.
- Ah fuck.
I'll get you home Frank.
Don't worry. I'll get you home.
I'm sorry, pal.
Where do you think
you're going little Hey?
I am going to the hospital.
To see my cousin.
Stop moving.
If you go any further with that money,
I'll shoot you in the head.
Fuck you, Ord.
I'm getting away, Ord.
See you..
Don't wait up for me Ord.
Damn.
You gotta smoke less dope
if you wanna hit some once in a while.
- Fuck you trash.
- Start you piece of junk.
Let's go.
Is that you, Harry?
Is that John Denver, Harry?
- Four eye fucker, faggot!
- The fuck?
I'll be the last man standing.
Get the fuck out of here,
you rotten zombie.
Nice ride.
Get the fuck out of here.
I'd say we got about 15 minutes
before the fudge shows up..
What do you want to do?
Get a beer.
Sure.
Why the fuck not?
Who's buying?
- Technically, you are.
- Yeah?
- Hey, hey hey, come on.
- Fucking hands off!
Come on. Get up asshole.
Let's get the fuck up.
Oh, they really did a number on you?
Didn't they?
Do you want me the hold that?
You know,
I think I can manage.
Why don't you sit down right there?
Go grab a seat.
Oh fuck, I think they shot
Harry in the ass.
Alright, I got a John Denver
story for you.
You made it.
Good for you.
Yeah.
I'm sorry you got in the way.
Hey, who were the shooters?
I'm not good with names.
Martin hired them.
So about dinner...
Can I take a rain check?
You take what you want girl.
