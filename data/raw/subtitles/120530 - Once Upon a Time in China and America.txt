It means...
...asking for your name
The man's name was "Shit"
He wanted us to stop
But in such remote places,
we shouldn't stop...
...for strangers
He may die of thirst
if we don't stop for him
Club Foot, tell him to pull over at once
Yes
Master, I've been eating too many
beans I have diarrhea from it
If I don't have rice soon,
I'm going to die
Stop!
Fei hong, he can't hear you
What are you doing?
Pal, please stop to save that guy
Nothing makes me happier than
saving a life
How about saving yourself first?
This is a good chance...
...to practice your English,
come on
You know how?
I know everything!
You really understand what he said?
No
I simply pretend that I do
Cut the crap and start eating
It's beans again?
We have to be very lucky to have
made it to America
Ah Sol's clinic...
there is another called
Po Chi Lam right?
Yes, exactly under the same name
After all these beans,
I'll need to pay him a visit
He must be joking
Master, we don't have to eat
beans anymore
Where are you going?
How would you like to have
some chicken?
"Or me?"
How do I drink you?
You have no sense of humour.
Now,
don't you ever say
that I've no sense of humour
Watch out!
Master, many barbarians here!
Protect Aunt Yee
Yes!
I can manage on my own
Fei hong!
Club Foot!
The horses are out of control
Give me a ride!
Yee, I'm here to save you!
Club Foot!
This is dangerous, go back in
Yes!
Hands off my carriage
Where is your Master?
Fei hong, where are you?
What did you say?
I can't hear you
Watch my kick!
I don't need you
Out!
Sit properly
Be careful
Hold tight!
Fei hong...
Fei hong...
Yee...
Master
Club Foot...
Yee...
Fei...
Fei hong...
Let's go!
No big deal!
The beer in town isn't good anyway!
Sit down...
Let me take a look!
It hurts
It's alright
Take a seat...
Wait
Dr. So, help!
Dr. So, where are you?
Bring them in...
What's happened?
We saved them...
...from the Gold Sand River
They've waken up for a short while,
then again lost consciousness
Club Foot!
Aunt Yee
Ying,
Yes, Master!
Go massage his chest
By using the technique which
you have just learnt
Doctor... may I massage
this lady for you?
No... I'll help her...
Stop!
What are you guys fighting for?
Let's take turns
I'll be the first. Yes...
Wait! She is...
She is my master's fiance,
don't you dare lay a finger on her
Let me give you a hand!
This white bastard actually
wants more!
Shut up
She's awake now
Club Foot!
Aunt Yee
I am damn hungry
Club Foot!
Fei hong!
I have a new son!
This weave is excellent,
we should learn how to do it
Father, the great spirit has
blessed me with another son
Where am I?
How can you be so rude to a lady?
"What is your name" means...
...what's your name in Chinese!
What is your name?
Master,
I've been eating too many beans,
if I don't have rice soon,
I'll die too
I beg your pardon
Wong Fei hong... Master Wong...
Aunt Yee
Aunt Yee,
would you like a cup of tea?
Master Wong
Wong Fei hong
This is Master's umbrella!
Aunt Yee...
Look, this is Master's umbrella
Aunt Yee,
shall we have lunch first?
I ain't hungry. You guys go ahead
You bastard,
we are only searching for our friend
They treat us Chinese miners
like dogs,
having all kinds of
restrictions on us
Yeah!
We are always on the wrong side
Shall we stand together and
overcome him now?
No... The sergeant is nice to us
Chinese indeed!
Remember?
He had driven away some white
bastards for us several times
Let's go!
Hey!
Yes?
Hey! What are you doing here?
What are you doing!
Don't touch her!
"What"? The hell!
What the hell?
It's raining cats and dogs,
please go back inside
No, Fei hong won't find us
when he is back
Master would be upset
if you fell sick
Exactly, please go back inside
"Fei hong..."
"Yee..."
"Master..."
"Club Foot..."
"Yee..."
Give way...
What are you guys looking at?
It is a woman
What's so exciting about a woman?
Don't you think
you're too old for that?
But I can still see well...
...with my eyes
Shoot!
We are closed for business today
Aunt Yee!
Club Foot,
help me to check its texture
- Yes!
- Should I add more water?
Good?
Sol, what are you eating?
This is glue
Is it sticky enough?
Very!
And you!
Why did you say it tastes good?
I did not! I was only nodding
Go post these Lost
and these bills on the street
Yes Ma'am
Let's go, gluey mouth
Post one here
Post one here!
Why did he tear...
...our poster away?
What did he say?
Nothing... Let's go
Hey, you are good
This!
You want to learn leg stance?
If not you can put up
with the hardship
Like this!
Press each of your legs like this
for 4 hours
That's all it takes
Aunt Yee! Aunt Yee
Now I want a fight!
Club Foot, teach them a lesson
Sure!
No, this is only good for a warm up
since master isn't around
Sol, translate for me
What?
Tell them to fight me all at once
if anyone of them beat me
They are the winner
Club Foot, he said if...
Aunt Yee, what about you?
How can I enjoy
this beautiful landscape now?
Why don't you take me back to...
...where you found me?
Maybe I can remember
where I come from
Only you have no idea
on what I am saying
Clothes, how I wish you could talk
Then you would be able to
explain everything
Master... America... Setting up
Po Chi Lam... One year anniversary,
Sol...
What's this letter about?
Is it by me or for me?
My name is Sol?
...and I have a master?
I must find him,
he will have the answer
Wong Fei!
This name sounds familiar,
I must have known him
If I found him,
everything would be explained
What can I do for you?
I want to marry your daughter!
Fierce Eagle!
Fierce Eagle!
Please, do not fight!
Hey, don't...
Hey...
Come on!
Let me try
I really envy you guys
At least you know
where your roots are
I don't even know where I come from
You don't understand a bit of
what I'm saying
That's fine, at least you are lucky
Unlike me, I keep thinking...
...where I should be heading
Thank you
From now on,
verbal communication is not necessary
Body language is much better, right?
I tried to forget,
but the vision keeps coming back
Damn it!
I must learn to let go
You like it?
Take it!
Fei hong, have a smoke!
Oh no!
Aunt Yee is losing her mind
Nah, it is not that
What's it then?
Master's stuff reminds her of him
Master?
Though I did not like you to smoke,
it isn't my main concern now
Fei hong?
You're a woman?
Fei hong!
Fei hong? Who is Fei hong?
You are Fei hong!
Am I? Then who are you?
I am Yee, Aunt Yee, your fiance!
Since you are my aunt,
how can you be my fiance as well?
Your name is Yellow?
All the people here call me Ye low
You cant just grab that!
Take it back!
She can't do without the ring,
why wouldn't she want it?
The darker part of your inside is
taking over
That's why I feel sick?
Absolutely
So I must sit under the sun more?
Aunt Yee is making a mess
in Po Chi Lam
Everyone in Po Chi Lam tries to
stay away from her
And you thought
Master had bad temper?
You should check her out now
We haven't seen a Chinese women
for ages
How is it when Aunt Yee gets mad?
Sol...
Aunt Yee is making a fuss again
What's the fuss this time?
She is packing up
Aunt Yee, where do you want to go?
Back to China
China?
What?
Prepare a carriage for me,
I am going home
Club Foot, prepare the carriage
Why so?
Aunt Yee is having
odd thinking again
Take her for a walk
around the block,
then tell her she's already home
Aunt Yee, shall we?
What are you doing?
You really think I am insane?
I know how to get back to China
It takes 10 days to reach
San Francisco by carriage,
Another six months...
...to Hong Kong by ship
From there it takes 3 days'
on train to Canton,
then again by carriage to Fu Shan
Whatever you say will not change
my decision
Now will you go prepare
the carriage?
Fine
Aunt Yee, we are ready now
Club Foot
Aunt Yee, this way please...
Aunt Yee,
I've forgotten my luggage,
I must go back
Carry it Sol
Aunt Yee...
Aunt Yee...
Aunt Yee...
Aunt Yee, it's master!
Master...
Aunt Yee, Master...
May I ask...
I accept no explanation from you
Aunt Yee...
I ain't here to explain, I just...
I don't want to hear anything
You happen to know someone
called Sol?
Sol?
What about Wong Fei?
Does it ring the bell?
I go ask her then
Master is teasing us, isn't he?
No... Master seems to have lost
his memory
Piss off! Leave me alone, would you?
You are Aunt Yee right?
I am not!
Do you know Wong Fei then?
Wong... what?
Please stop!
Aunt Yee
I don't give allowance just
because you're a woman
What are you doing?
Checking your pulse
Aunt Yee, Master suffers...
...from loss of memory
So...
He has lost his memory?
What should we do?
Let me try
What are you doing?
I want to show you
Wong's super stance,
No Shadow Kick
Who is Wong Fei hong?
Sure that was you!
You are one of the 10 Canton Tigers,
coach of the local militia
You live in no. 8,
Sing Nam Street, Fu Shan,
you're a doctor
You give free treatment to the poor,
and teach Chinese Kung fu
You are the Master of Po Chi Lam,
people's hero,
Wong Fei hong
What is 10 Canton Tigers?
And coaching for what?
No. 8, Sing Nam Street, Fu Shan?
Free treatment to people?
Kung fu master?
Master of Po Chi Lam,
people's hero
Wong Fei hong?
He is Wong Fei hong?
Notice that...
...we both know this pose?
Club Foot, he forgot who he is
Showing him the pose is no use
Are you alright?
Are you alright, Sol?
Yeah, I'm alright
You must help him regain his memory
You!
Wong Fei hong,
I, Yim Chun tung,
will see how good you really are
Ha! With my iron cloth martial arts,
you can't beat me!
Come on!
Get in there!
Wong Fei hong,
You should go for my stomach
not my face!
Wong Fei hong,
do you remember Na Lan Yuan Shu?
Na Lan Yuan Shu
Na Lan Yuan Shu!
Quit fooling around
Club Foot!
Follow me!
Master,
why are you getting fired up?
Club Foot, stop fighting with him!
Club Foot!
Stop fighting!
Fei hong!
Yee!
Yee, are you alright?
I am fine
Club Foot...
I am fine!
Club Foot
How did you fall so badly?
It wasn't from falling
Master, you hit me!
It's okay now, Club Foot
The Master is back!
This trip to America...
...is just like a dream
I can do with a dream...
...with an Indian beauty
What?
Only you know the story!
I've just cleaned my face
You can give the ring twice,
but you can't wash your face twice?
Sure, sure
I can't remember anything
I don't understand
what you're talking about
Have you thought of that woman?
I don't have time
to think about woman
Do you miss her?
Well, a little bit
You just said
you haven't thought of woman
Thinking and missing are
two different things
If you don't think of her,
how can you miss her?
But it's the truth
The truth is I don't want to
talk to you anymore
But the one I miss is you
You know...
I can never say
these things out loud
The games are about to start. Hurry!
Master Wong
How's everyone?
Master Wong is here, Uncle Lone,
Master Wong is here
So?
Master Wong doesn't like
people gambling
Let's pack it up and gamble later
No way,
I've just won this game
Hurry up
Master is coming!
Have you won?
How much did you bet?
I want in
Let's gamble together
Come on!
Master Wong, you too?
Come, let me be the House
Come on, come on!
Let's have some larger bets
Really?
Sure! Bet more!
Okay, if Master Wong wants us to,
we'll bet a little
Master...
Bets down and hands off
You've got nowhere...
...to spend your money anyway
Why don't you bet it all?
Master Wong, you are our hope,
you gamble like us,
how can we find a role model?
We are not used to seeing
you gambling
Master Wong,
why don't you be your normal self?
We won't gamble anymore...
Today
Get out of here!
We understand now
People,
I thank you all...
...for your concern
I have something to say
You came a long way...
to a foreign place,
Po Chi Lam was opened
for this reason
"When they eave home, goods are
worth more and people are worth less"
And you should know who you are
I don't hope for good business,
that'll require you being ill
Rather I hope Po Chi Lam...
...help you achieve good health,
build up a strong body
Copy the merits of foreigners and
compensate our short comings
And shine...
...for the Chinese people
Simply put,
you must remember who you are
Today, I would like to stop here,
thank you for listening
Master Wong, that was a great speech
You're too kind...
Let's go...
Sir, take the money,
it was hard earned
Master Wong, no more speech please
Bye! Bye!
Please excuse me...
Let's do it,
Master Wong won't come this time
Why?
He is real busy. Come on!
I'll be the House
Bet. Bet. Bet
It's pay day!
Uncle Han, who is that guy?
He is our foreman,
and always cheats us
So what if you can kick real fast?
Don't forget,
this is a world of guns
You can't be as fast as a bullet
Master
Master Wong
How's everyone?
How are you?
Master Wong, is that a new sign?
Yes
People,
I have something to say today
Master, you have something
to say again?
Why don't you show us...
...some fist dance
instead of a speech?
Yeah, come on! Show us
Show us some fist dance! Come on
You'll get the chance!
Today is the first anniversary of...
the American Po Chi Lam
First of all,
I would like to thank you all
for taking care of my student Sol
Don't mention it,
we are all Chinese!
We should help each other,
right?
People, you've come a long way...
to a foreign place
You should co operate and
take care of each other
Po Chi Lam was opened...
...for this reason
I don't hope...
...for good business,
that'll require you being ill
This is not what I hoped for
Instead, I hope that...
The American Po Chi Lam...
...would become your club house
when you have time,
you can have tea,
chat, and practice Kung fu here
Build up a strong body
And come in focus...
...with Po Chi Lam's spirit
Hand in hand
we copy foreigners' merits and
compensate our short comings
And shine...
...for the Chinese people
That's all
Come in! Refreshment time!
Let's go and have some snacks...
Master,
I think your speech deserved
some applause
Aunt Yee may come...
the timing of Aunt Yee's presence
wasn't right
Right!
Make yourself at home,
there's still more...
No! It's ridiculous!
Quiet!
They said we were involved
in the robbery,
they want to search this place
No problem, we are innocent!
Give way,
let the police do their job
search this place
What? How can it be?
Be careful, Master,
they will shoot!
Billy! I appreciate you too!
Uncle Lone is right
This is Po Chi Lam's problem,
nothing to do with you all
Sol, tell the sergeant,
can I take all the responsibility?
No!
You can't confess to the crime alone
If you are going to be
the first to confess,
I'll be the second
Sol!
Master my nick name is Ah Chat,
if I am not the 3rd one,
I will be the 7th one
Fei hong
You all stay here, I'll go alone
This is a set up!
Master Wong, you are young
and capable
Your life should be spared for...
...the good of we Chinese workers
You've nothing to do
with Po Chi Lam,
don't get yourself into trouble!
Uncle, we are not telling others the
pathetic tales of the Chinese workers
We want to tell the glorious
history of the Chinese workers
I, Wong Fei hong,
should stand for all of you
Who disagrees?
Come with me
Fei hong
It's my fault!
I couldn't imagine that,
the establishment of Po Chi Lam
in America a year ago,
would pave the way for tragedy
And I dragged Master down too...
Uncle Han, are you afraid?
Getting married and working hard,
Living as an emperor at home
but working as a slave outside...
That is my life!
Master Wong
This is all I can do
Master Wong,
stuffed dumplings for you
Eat!
Master, we all depend on you
Master,
I have full confidence in you
I want more!
They're waiting!
Why were you not in jail...
...with us?
I didn't do anything
I didn't do anything wrong
Escape!
Move everyone
No! No!
Master, they are the bank robbers
I have to get him to clear my name
Sol, save the others first
Master, leave these two to me
This is for you!
Go in
Go, get out...
get out...
Surrender now!
Hold it tight!
Come on up!
Come on up. Look out!
I need you to prove my innocence
Get up!
Why are you guys here?
Fei hong, are you alright?
Where do you go?
I get them here to help you!
Who are they?
They are...
Forget it
People are hurt
Let's go help them
Club Foot, get ready for dragon dance
Come here!
Congratulations, Billy
I trust you will be a good Mayor
My name is Wong Fei hong
Who are they?
Don't you remember them?
Everyone...
Master Wong, no more speeches!
It's time to get going
That's right,
if you miss this train,
you'll miss the boat as well
Now go
Yeah...
Club Foot!
Master,
didn't you have
a long speech prepared?
How come you finished your speech
so soon?
Everyone...
Master Wong, please do go now
Get on the train
Let's go!
See you!
See you...
Here she is!
Master Wong, take care
How are you doing?
Who is that woman?
People say she's Uncle Lone's wife
Where the hell is it?
It's far from home!
It's a nice place
It's a nice place!
Right!
I am tired!
I'll need at least 3 days' rest
before I can take care of you
No problem. As you wish
Why are they so happy?
Happy!
No more than 10 people per day,
and I break on the 1st and 15th
You really don't remember
the Indian woman?
No, I remember nothing!
See you!
No need to see me off, Sol,
go tend to the store
Good bye!
