In 80 AMM (After Mickey Mouse) the mice of Planet X
were threatened by the apocalyptic ghouls of humiliation and complete extinction.
Bloodthirsty cats grouped into well-organized, well-equipped multinational gangs,
denying law and order, ignoring the historical conventions between cats and mice
aiming for the complete annihilation of the race of the mouse.
But on the verge of total destruction,
when the wisest mice were already thinking about leaving the planet
suddenly a new hope was born...
{pos(322,182)}Cat-Catcher
I can assure you madam
that our bank will provide your deposit with utter safety.
The thickness of our vault doors
as well as our security system...
I don't doubt that sir, but surely
you know how sharp their claws are.
They could only break in here with a tank.
And that hasn't happened yet.
No!! ... Only over my dead body!
Go on, Safranek.
The Ironcat Squad launched our first armored unit at the savings bank successfully.
Results?
Two tons of gold and about ten million in differing banknotes.
What do you mean by 'about'?
10.347.915 - plus two pennies.
That is, already with the first mission we regained our investments almost fivefold.
Any accidents? Injuries?
Nothing. A police car with full mice-onell was about to...
To the point Safranek, alright?
What about their cheese-section?
Sadly, Mr. Teufel, the situation... so to say, half of a success.
How come?
By the time our work-team got there, half of it was already taken into their warehouses.
Again those damned mouse holes!
Do you think they sniffed out our plans?
Out of the question, Mr. Teufel. There are no traitors among us!
Then obviously you were too comfy and took it slow again!
But this is the last time...! Who was participating in the mission?
Jimmy the Spotted and squad 87.
Liquidate them!
Yes sir! Bullet in the head or poison?
No, that would be a waste. Throw them in the river!
Yes sir, Mr. Teufel!
Any benefits to the widows? Mourning clothes benefit? Benefit for the widowed?
Nothing. The usual telegraph of condolence from the chairman.
And for the orphans a piece of candy. One for each of course.
Anything else?
Excuse me, Mr. Teufel... but the...
What's the problem Safranek?
What if the trade union finds out..?
Who's the chairman of the trade union now?
Skinny Joe. On the occasion of the last downsizing he was also protesting.
Just throw something in his face...!
He's 82, sir. Completely blind!
What an idiot!
Yes sir, that's why he took the job.
You're the idiot Safranek. I meant it figuratively.
I'm so sorry, sir. So, we shall fill his mouth with something?
Whatever rows your boat. Anything else?
Lab C is waiting for your attendance, Mr. Teufel.
Finally.
Who's that moron in the back?
One of our technicians. A really enthusiastic workmate.
Fire him. We don't need clowns.
Yes sir.
Good morning gentlecats. You shall begin.
The aim of the procedure is to 'micrate' the subject, that is, to shrink him.
According to Lab C..
This is the way to infiltrate the underground hideouts of the mice that were inaccessible up till now.
Bravo! We made it!
Isn't it amazing!
True. Very interesting.
I didn't expect that. Congratulations Safranek.
Thank you sir! If I may add, the basics of the procedure were my ideas.
Oh really?
Bring in a normal lab mouse.
Let me out!
You canary-chomping bastards! Let me out if you dare!
Let me gnaw on your sour-creamy whiskers!
Let him out.
Do you see that midget-cat, 411?
Yes?
If you beat him, you're free.
You.. come here kitty kitty kitty...
Just you wait! You bastard! You bite..?!
Ouchie, that hurts!
Take this!
Help me! Mommy!
What are you doing?
Just you wait! Grabowszky will get you, bastards!
Never believe a cat's words!
If I got it right just now...
the basics of the procedure...
were your ideas.
No! No..! No...
I mean yes.. but.. in reality I couldn't have known...
How much did the experiment cost?
For.. nothing.. nothing!
Te.. no.. twen.. no! Eigh.. no! ... One and a half million.
Come a little closer Safranek.
MouseNews! With the latest news, MouseNews!
The cats strike again! 12 casualties! Read all about it!
Thank you sir.
MouseNews!...
Please! Where are your manners!
Can't you see that I was fir...
What a beautiful day!
MouseNews!
It's about time the police did something about cat gangs!
MouseNews!
What happened to Grabowszky?
MouseNews with the latest news!
MouseNews!
With the latest news!...
Eat it.
Yes sir.
Not the gun, you little brat.
This filth!
Edlington. Edlington. To HQ.
Password?
An incy wincy pidgy, inside of it the doodoo of a cuckoo cat.
Welcome Edlington. We've been waiting for you.
Fancy a drink?
A little coffee with a lot of milk, without sugar.
Thank you.
Meh, all this fuss for the entry.
Is it really necessary, boss?
Definitely.
We have to keep our illusion of being inaccessible to cats in this place.
But after you're done grumbling, we would be interested to hear your report.
Ready.
Yesterday night I was able to get in touch with Pokio.
That reminds me...
Can't you fix that wretched satellite, Nilsen? I could barely hear anything!
Don't toy with us, stop beating around the bush Edlington, or else I'll gnaw your tail off.
Alrighty, boss.
So... the professor is ready with the plans.
Yay. lol
Chill, guys.
We still don't have that thing in our hands.
We have to send somebody to pick it up ASAP.
How's the production line doing?
It's all ready. We're only waiting for the plans.
Excellent.
Well then, gentlemice, let me hear the suggestions.
The public wants Grabowszky.
Martinez...?
Naw, Grabowszky's done for. He quit, he's finished.
He reads the Toro and he eats junk food.
Nah, he always does that.
After the King Kong situation, he told everybody that he's the 13th reincarnation of Mickey Mouse.
He was constantly meditating and filled his apartment with incense.
Everybody was laughing at him.
However, that summer he was the only one not bugged by mosquitoes.
You never know with Grabowszky.
But this case can only be solved by him.
Send somebody from the psycho-technicians to him.
Psycho-technicians...
I've decided, gentlemice.
I'll lure away Cincinatus from the horns of the plough.
Safranek!
Sir?
What happened to you Safranek?
I nicked myself while shaving, sir.
Next time take more care.
Do you know this mouse?
So?
No, sir. Any alias?
Might be a new agent of the Intermouse. Maybe in the Department of Agriculture.
Find it out. You get an hour.
Yes, sir!
Safranek!
Yes, sir?
You don't like me.
Something tells me so.
I love you, Mr. Teufel.
Excellent. The inferior shall always love his boss.
This is one of the founding principles of our organisation.
You may go now.
This is the apartment of Mr. Giovanni Gatto.
It's Teufel. Please put me through to the director, kitty.
I'm awfully sorry but it's impossible. Mr. Gatto is freshening up.
This is an important matter, kitty. Move your little silky smooth caboose right away!
What's up Teufel.
What's so urgent?
Sir, that THING at the Intermouse...
..seems like it's done.
What 'thing', Teufel?
Please I do beg you, don't entertain me with riddles.
Sadly.. sadly I don't.. I don't exactly know.. Mr. director, but..
And that's why you disturbed me while I was freshening up?
You're making me very sad, Teufel.
They invented some kind of new weapon.. one of the most famous professors of the university..
To the point, Teufel. I beg you.
Where are the plans!
They're sending a new agent for them soon.
If you allow me with all due respect to make a suggestion.
Catch this person in charge.
And it would be terrific if you reported it right away.
Will you, Teufel?
Of course. Naturally, right away, sir.
And, eh, Teufel.
Yes, sir?
If it's possible...
Don't you dare disturb me once more while I'm freshening up.
You understand me, don't you?
I understand, sir.
Your wish is my comm...
Let's play tag! You're it!
My tail doesn't count!
Let it go or I'll eat you!
C'mon, Samu. Don't be silly. I was only joking.
C'mon. Come out.
Right. Wait! I'll bring you some tasty cheese!
Eat up, Samu!
If you don't want it all, you can take the rest to your little siblings.
Won't you bring them all sometime? When daddy's not home...
Cathy!
Yes, dad!
How many times did I tell you not to leave the..
Cathy.. you don't even like cheese.
Ah! You were playing with that evil filthy little worm again!
Where did you hide it?!
No.. I really don't..
So now you're lying! Alright! Tonight you won't get dinner as a punishment!
Get full with your friend!
Cathy...
See, Grabowszky! You can do it.
I was aiming for the table...
You come in for a general check-up, and we'll shape you up in a week.
It's useless, Mr. Poljakoff. Something's burnt out in me.
Don't be silly.
The receptor-waves are not going through, Mr. Teufel.
This old cottage is like a sponge.
I don't care. Figure something out! I need to know what those two are babbling about.
Send out the Curious Fly!
We can give it a try. But I don't...
I want results, not excuses! Do you get that?!
Or else you'll be flying back to the can!
What is it, Safranek!
Report on the person of interest.
Cincinatus is a historic figure who has been dead for a couple hundred years. After retiring he was asked back into the senate.
As they know it.
As we know it..?
I suspect you're mocking me, Safranek.
Come a little closer.
Oh, uh, no. The report was taken word by word from the encycl...
I only have milk in can at home.
And you're complaining to me! My fake teeth hurt just by looking.
Yeah, these still work.
Although I could do with a new diamond cover.
Maybe you'll still have a budget for that.
You know we don't have too much money left. This new base consumed all of our budget.
I still have some money saved! I'm prepared for hard times.
I can see. I would like to...
quit and come here to live with you.
Can you play chess?
Of course!
Though 8 out of 10 games I always beat myself.
What about the other two?
Usually I win those.
Maybe you could improve the figures.
Could happen, but I'd need a partner to practice for that.
You could do that. Do you have enough...
What's going on?
Look!
(But I don't like playing with the two of us.)
They started a fire!
Let me!
Bring it back or we'll pay for the rest of our lives.
Who would have thought that they'd make a fire on such a hot day!
Ah, you see. You can't get out of the flow.
Well then, tomorrow at 9 in my office.
Why not in HQ?
There is no HQ. They blew it all up yesterday night.
Almost the whole security squad died in there.
You know, Grabowszky, we don't have much time left.
Only THAT thing can help us.
What if they have bugged the office?
We'll mime then.
Please, close the window, Edlington!
I'm driven crazy by this...
Mucisal clown of the committee?
Almost.
This is 'Lazy Dick' the orchestra of the police.
He's practicing right now.
I've already mentioned that our budget is really tight.
Speaking of which...
You can hand in your solicitation of tools for the trip but I warn you in advance: we are poor like the mice of a church.
I don't believe in the gadgets of civilization.
Plus I have everything needed.
And if not... you can find good friends everywhere.
Let's get to the point. When shall I start off?
Watch out! Only miming!
My aim?
And who shall I be looking for?
Professor Fushimisi, Pokio.
1514, Nishiazabu.
I have an idea.
He's guarding the plans there.
Let's also send Lazy Dick to Pokio.
He'll distract them to give me free hand.
OK, Grabowszky.
Everything will go according to your plans.
Thank you... and have a nice...
..but I'd rather not say anything.
Nilsen. Our destiny is in the hands of Nick Grabowszky.
It'll all go well.
If it was only in his hands I'd also be optimistic. But now it's too late.
Do you know what Julius Caesar said?
That guy who smuggled heroin in his prosthetic leg?
Yeah, him.
So. Professor Fushimisi, Pokio, 1314 Nishiazabu the address.
Grabowszky's idea: a two-person mission.
Lazy Dick heads to Pokio publicly.
Grabowszky goes on another route, in complete secrecy.
Complete secrecy...
Thank you for the interpretation, Ali Bendumb. You may go now.
I said, you MAY GO NOW.
Of course. Your fee.
He thinks I'm Ali-baba and he's the 40 thieves.
Here you go.
Safranek!
Safranek.
Call Shwartz. Tell him to contact me right away.
Yes, sir.
Safranek?
Yes, sir?
Another little accident..?
I was shaving, sir..
But your hand!
Yes I had the razor in it, sir.
Poor Safranek...
You have a string of bad luck on you.
I hope I didn't hurt you in any way.
Not at all, sir.
What a relief.
You know..
Cooperation between boss and inferiors is the key to success.
You're absolutely right, sir.
You may go now, Safranek.
And please give my regards to your lovely wife.
Thank you sir, but she's been living with you for a year now.
The news.
The president held a reception for Giovanni Gatto, the great businesscat.
The president hasn't been seen ever since.
Special elections next week.
Colonel Lazy Dick travelled to Pokio today to take part in another congress of public safety cooperation.
Bob Poljakoff and the city police have seen him off.
'Have a nice trip, Dick!'
In the morning on Gonzales street, nine twins of the Speedy family have been kidnapped by unidentified cats.
According to eye-witnesses there was an outstandingly ugly cat loitering around the vicinity at that time.
..have attacked and robbed the enterprise..
Excuse me, sir.
Sup buddy. You got a problem?
You forgot the program.
Sir Nero von Schwarz.
How is Mr. Teufel?
I hope I said that right.
What a great weather we have, don't you think?
Listen carefully, Schwarz.
Von Schwarz, if I may.
Suit yourself.
I need some mice.
Of ours.
I'm at your service, Mr. Teufel, as always.
Robbery? Smuggling? Observation?
Grabowszky.
Maybe..
However, I have to tell you in advance that because of the special client the usual price...
You'll get tenfold of it.
OK! Plus commission and taxes.
You're a grand thief, old geezer.
I'm flattered...
But you're still the best, Mr. Teufel.
You're the most disgusting when you're trying to be nice.
Well, but let's get to the point.
Your mice will follow Grabowszky to Pokio.
He's picking up some kind of plans there.
Take those away from him and then do him in.
Easy as pie.
May I flatter myself by thinking of a special prize in case of success?
If you'd like to get your nose smashed.
On the other hand, if things turn out bad don't even dare to hope.
Who can you recommend?
As a matter of fact I accidentally have some material of reference on me.
Brand new, excellent quality.
So? What do you think?
What's this bull?
This is the new hip!
Von Schwarz always keeps up with fashion.
You're pulling my leg, aren't you.
These are rats!
You're not a racist, are you Mr. Teufel!
And what if they are rats!
The results are guaranteed and the costs are the same.
I'll never meddle with blacks again.
You'll see Mr. Teufel, I'll bring you luck! The other day...
..as I was crossing the street...
Scram, Schwarz.
Von Schwarz.
Bye bye!
That's him!
Shut up! I have eyes, too!
Alright, I just said so.
But don't say so!
Anyways, stop your babbling.
Aha.
Don't 'aha' me!
Rule number one. A good gangster doesn't babble but acts instead!
Remember, when we had left ballet and chose a new career, the old geezer said...
For heaven's sake, Buddy!
We're gonna miss the client!
I'm the boss, okay?!
Aha.
Don't.. don't 'aha' me or I swear...
Sweety-peeny. Yes, yes just come on already.
Well then, everybody open their eyes and shut their mouth.
Luckily not the other way round 'cause then we'd hit the tree.
Go for it!
We're doing excellent so far, aren't we?
Alright, I just said so.
Shut up!
Boss.
May I ask something?
But only if it's important.
When can we take these things off, I can't see anything!
Well, me neither! .. But I'm not whining.
Do you know what rule number three is?
Mmm.. I only know the sixth one.
A good gangster is... lustful.
But not on the job!
Rule number three: a good gangster always camouflages himself.
Always.
In direct contact we'll put stockings on our heads.
Oh, no!
But.. but.. I only have fishnet stockings on me!
Doesn't matter. Billy will lend you his socks.
Aha.
And now QUIET!
Or you can go back to ballet, hopping here and there.
Can you make some music, boss?
Since we can't chit-chat..
This car can do anything!
Press the 4th button. Billy!
Yes, boss!
Some good rock!
What have you done, you animal!
You said it! I pressed the 4th! I didn't know...
Let's get out of here, guys!
We didn't want to buy more petrol anyways.
You animal!
You almost hit the client! What would we do..!
But I was only... But he told me to!
Rule number two: a good gangster...
Why are you so worked up!
'Cause this animal gets the police on our neck!
Me? An animal..?
We'll take care of them!
Animal!
But he said the 4th, isn't that right!
Animal!
Cut it out already!
You can't do in half of the country just because of this animal!
See?! He said it again! I'm no animal!
Animal!
You are, Billy, you are. Just accept it.
He said the 4th button, didn't he!
Animal!
Watch out guys! They're already here!
Jesus, Billy. I'm going to...
Calm down, Buddy. Step on it!
Let me handle that!
You can't even read!
Gimme!
Get off my head you...
Watch out...!
Any beverages?
Beverages.
Any beverages?
What can I give you, sir?
A yogurt, please.
With ice?
With bacon.
A lot! ..of bacon.
The Retracer 2000 is equipped with a compressor...
C'mon!
and an engine with an accumulator...
Look for the buttons, you stupid chick!
I told you she doesn't know! Haha.
Shut up!
General information. The engine's electronic comm... commmm..
C'mon.
...mmunicational central sockets... I can't see any buttons anywhere.
Oh, God! Take the wheel!
Watch out! To the right!!
Ah, I can't see!
Lemme go!
Idiot! Watch out!!
The lights...
Do something already! Oh my God!
I'll never be 20 again!
My head! Get off my head! Can't you hear me!?
Don't you understand, I can't see anything!
Ow, my stomach!
Stay put, man!
Changing the oil... gadgets and...
To the right!
To the left!
B...b..ou..s..s... I ca...oun...t... breeeaaa...dddd...
You don't need to breathe now... chill.
Gauge... brakes...
BRAKES!
Steamroller!
I found it!
Information.
Our information section is at your service, madam.
What assholes! They ripped us off with a car for women!
Hey! We're being followed by cops on bikes!
What do we do!
Please press button 13, ma'am.
Hey. Can you hear them?
Of course. Mosquitoes.
Moron.
I meant the cops.
I shot them 5 mins ago.
Jesus Christ up in heaven!
On route 66 at the 521st milestone two policemice with bikes.
They are still alive.
Send an ambulance immediately. Over.
But I'm deeply sorry!
Shut the heck up!
What manners!
Let me go you aaa..
..let me out!
I demand!
I'm a member of the Intermouse!
They will get you for this!
Don't you hear me!
Don't you hear me!!
No, they don't hear me.
No panicking! Everybody stays where he is!
Just to let you know, you are now being kidnapped!
The ransom is 1 million per person!
Alright. Let's make it 800.000.
OK. 500.000.
But this is my last offeee...eer.
I was scared for a little bit.
Not like this, eh?
Who are you?
Oh!
Nothing. I know, I know.
Moron...
..you animal.
It should be here by now.
Maybe the other ro...
Listen!
Go back till the crossroads, maybe he used the other road.
Pissy?
Whatever.
Idio.. Meh! To hell with it!
They should be sued, those damn bastards!
Who?!
Well the ones who put all these nails around! This is dangerous!
We were the ones who dropped these off, you retard!
Well then.. wha.. us?
Us.
Maybe you!
But what for?
Well against the policemice on bikes.
Aha.
But those were shot by Pissy!
Billy, one more sound and I'll make a sieve out of you with my gun!
Did you see?!
The bastard deserted me, although it's forbidden!
Wasn't this the car of Grabowszky?
Obvioussssly.. you're completely right my darling, this was.
Well then why don't we go after him?
Is there a problem?
Yes, there is my darling.
If somebody doesn't strap me down right now, I'm gonna kill this moron!
Because all four tires are flat my darling.
Well ask the 'Information' about what to do in this situation.
Aha.
The information services of the Retracer...
Pardon, my lady, we're short on time and all four of our rubbers are flat.
Please press button 20, ma'am..
..and tell our service-truck the exact location you are at.
Hello, sweetie.
We're here on the sixty-...
Hey!
What did you do that for!
You wanna embarrass us so that Schwarz gets to know that we screwed up on the first corner?
He'll give us the sack so fast that we won't even realize we're back in the ballet hoppin' around!
Well then get four wheels you smart ass.
Wait for me here. I'll go get wheels.
Helloooo!
Is anybody here?
They've all died.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Gyurrika is a smart bird.
My suitcase!
Isn't this pace a bit slow, guys?
We'll never catch up with Grabowszky like this!
Here, my darling, I'll give you the wheel with pleasure.
But we should figure something out, because in the end we'll get screwed and...
We can go back to the ballet hopping around.
On the other hand, we won't get any more flat tires like this.
Hey!
Listen, Buddy!
No, I'm not listening, don't you get it!? I had enough of your brainless...
Don't be fooling around! Listen!
We could cut off this little hoop here..
..and we could win at least 100 miles!
Show me how the terrain is.
Does it matter? This baby goes over anything.
Pissy?
Whatever.
Our next plan is the mouse-manipulator.
The task..
- that is, to infiltrate even the smallest mouse holes -
.. is dealt with exceptionally well by this.
With the flexible arms it can be moved in any direction.
Staff on board: a cat and a rat.
Go on. Pay attention, Safranek.
Of course, sir.
May I recommend the hurricane-gas-pastilla?
When the cat head on the picture is spat at by the mouse,
the pastilla creates gas and the pressure launches the inhabitants out of the hole.
And how do you get the pastilla into the hole?
Any catlover mouse will do.
Go on.
This may be our most promising model..
though a little bit expensive.
But the result is unavoidable, like death.
We call it the 'camole' - originating from the words 'cat' and 'mole'.
Basically it's an underground tank which with its shovel-claws...
Everything is perfectly clear.
Thank you.
Many thanks once again, Mr. engineer.
We'll inform your firm about our decision.
Good bye, Mr. Teufel.
Well?
Which one would you choose Safranek?
Mmm.. well...
So?
Erm.. well.. I don't understand the question.
Don't pretend to be stupider than you actually are.
Which solution would you choose?
...well.. maybe...
..maybe the.. maybe model number one.
Alright. As you wish.
Chill! 5 more minutes and we're clear on the highway.
We'd better be, or I'll strangle you with your own tail.
You're dead now you ballet rat!
Was I driving? I say! Was it me?!
Let it..!
Munch!
You bite?! YOU BITE?!
What else should I do! Let me go, you..!
Just you wait you...!
Help! Help! He'll kill him!
Police!
Well.. well no!
That's bad even for a joke.
Chill Cookie. We're only arguing.
Take this you pimp!
You...! Catpawn!
Maybe we should do something.
I am doing, can't you see? I'm doing in a dead rat.
I can't breathe...
Stop it already.
Why don't you ask that chick what to do in this situation.
Strangle his neck until his face turns blue.
I don't need advice for this.
The information service of the Retracer is at your service, ma'am.
We're at the bottom of a pit, missy.
Can't move an inch.
In this case press the red button..
..and rest in peace.
WAIT!
Fo' what?
They don't stop, these bastards!
What do you expect from the filthy mouse-devourers.
Do you want me to shoot you a car?
Only if you first get rid of this idio..
C'mon! Don't start it again! You promised.
Don't shake me you moron, don't shake me!
Look over there!
Poor thing, he's in a shock.
Grabowszky.
Pre.. pretend that you don't see him!
Won't you lend me your lipstick, darling?
But of course.
Don't shoot him, don't shoot him or the deal is over.
Maybe he won't realize..
May I take you somewhere?
Thingy..
We only stopped for a...
We were only walking around and..
We're looking for a payphone...
Thank you for the offer,
yes.
We're heading for Catsville.
Get in, please.
If somebody offers me a free ride ever again,
I'll bash a stone at him and run away as far as I can.
Look at that! Some kind of a trail.
Why am I being followed by this ugly flower?
Snake!!
This is a carnivorous flower!
Thank you so much for the trip.
You're really so nice, thank you.
Move already, you camel!
Good bye, Mr. Grabowszky.
Bye bye, hon.
Farewell.
Thank you once again, good bye.
Our company is always at your service, ma'am.
Oh my meowing cat!
How did he do that!
He talked into our thingy with a thingy.
So it's thanks to him that our car exploded.
I didn't want to kill him before, but now I'll do him in 'cause he's one naughty mouse!
Hey! Why did you hit me in the side?
Doesn't matter anymore.
I thought you had done something idiotic again, like when you had called him by his name
since you couldn't have known what his name was!
But you can see that he knew that we had known who he was!
But the question is, does he know that we knew that he had known that we had known...
Cut the crap Cookie or I'll go nuts!
OK.
The point is that from now on we have to be even more careful!
Aha.
Get in.
I rented a car.
Oh god! What will this cost us!?
2 years of prison if you don't get in fast.
You bite!? Just you wait!
Every river sooner or later flows into the sea.
Not to mention that we might meet some friendly mice on the way.
C'mon.
To the sea, mouse!
Look! There's his car!
Pissy.
If this dude opens his mouth without permission once again, please shoot him.
Alright, I was just saying so...
Shut it!
Hey, you!
What do you want with that car?
Eh, relax.
It's only a nasty little mouse-lad.
Hey you! You damned little bastard!
You won't get two huge smacks in the face if you tell us where the owner of this car went.
He said I could only tell that fo' 5 rupees.
Gimme the dough or I'll make you beat me to death.
And ya can take that as a threat!
Here, you little filthy dirtbag.
Thankies.
So the dude's shipped away.
If you have good eyes, you can still see 'im.
So.
What's up with the plans?
We have four of our men on Grabowszky, Mr. director.
You mustn't take your eyes off him for a moment!
Teufel.
Yes, sir?
Saturday night I'm having a little party on the terrace.
You are invited of course...
..with the plans!
Don't even come without the plans.
Then I'd rather go to you...
with a new.. exciting.. interesting idea!
Do not worry.
I'm never out of new ideas!
I'm not worried, Mr. director.
But of course.
At 3.
Good luck, Teufel.
Thank you, Mr. director.
Good bye, Mr. director.
Safranek!
Yes, sir?
What news do you have about those rats?
I've just talked with them on the phone, sir.
They've lost Grabowszky.
He shipped away.
I've already sent one of our hydroplanes there, sir.
They will be in Pokio sooner than Grabowszky.
Well, finally! A little bit of independence!
Thank you, sir.
And the.. research?
We've only been waiting for your command, sir.
May I put lab 3 through?
Please do.
You may begin.
As you can see, Mr. Teufel...
The robot-mouse is able to go through even the smallest cracks.
The remote works in a range of 3 miles..
..so that it can reach even the furthest settlements.
And?
What do you mean 'and'?
How does it take out the goods?
I.. I I I'm... s.. sorry but there.. there must be a misunderstanding.
Because our task was to.. to..
to get into the smallest mouseholes, and we made it!
You could see that too..
..maybe! maybe we can put a nuclear missile on it..
..mouse poison..
..it could carry a TV-cam.. mousetrap..
How much did it cost?
Five..
Two million.
You shameless rat!
2 million for this crummy toy?
Any of our live research mice could do the same for a couple pennies!
You're right..!
If I may add, you're a genius, sir!
Come a bit closer, Safranek.
Oh, no sir, I beg you!
Would you rather I reported it to Mr. Gatto?
I'm coming sir!
This was smooth so far.
I hope those bastards won't sniff out our cargo.
Why?
We're carrying cheese?
Nah.
Coloured cotton.
These folks go crazy for that.
Do you have.. guns?
A couple second-hand trash, yes.
But they are only good as ballast.
These people don't have money.
Captain!
The catpirates!
Engine room: stop!
Everybody to the deck!
Mr. Simmons.
Pull up the white flag.
But captain, not even a gun was fired!
Please, Mr. Grabowszky!
At least hand out guns to the crew and give me one too!
Mr. Grabowszky!
I'm sorry, but I am responsible for the ship and crew.
Please, go to your cabin immediately!
Captain!
I'm warning you that I'm going to send a repo..
Enough!
Mr. Jackson!
Accompany Mr. Grabowszky to his cabin and lock the door.
Don't object, Mr. Grabowszky.
We'll hand the ship over...
We might have some chance of them letting us run.
Go!
We locked up a passenger in his cabin.
Let him come with us!
We'll take care of him.
And take this in return!
As snacks!
Thank you so much and.. ta.. ta..
Fatty! Zitty!
Throw the rope and...
then stay at the wheel.
You two! Look for that passenger.
And throw him in the sea.
Not too bad..
But how come I haven't seen a single crocodile yet?
I heard that there are tons of crocodiles around here.
Not that I miss them..
What the - - A storm?
But the sky is all clear.
My God! A waterfall!!
That's why there are no crocodiles here!
He's not in the storage either.
Check the anchor-cabin, too.
I'll check the motor-house.
Hi, kitty.
Hey, kitty cat.
Hey, kitty cat.
Hey.
What was that?
The hell!
Seems like the cable got broken.
What's up!
The cable got broken, boss!
Fish out the end of the cable..
and tie it back in.
Stop.
Stop it!
Do something!
To the left.
To the left!
To the riiiiiight!
Unfortunately, I don't know more tunes.
Maybe I can't keep it up until Pokio?
Before a couple thousand miles were a piece of cake.
But Buddy!
Don't pollute the ocean!
OMG a crocodile!
Who is it?!
Help!
Let me go!
Buenas noches senor!
No scare!
Pedro no drop!
Who are you and where are you taking me?
Pedro take to boss.
Maxipotzak love tiny fatty mouses!
But I object!
I'm Lazy Dick.
I'm a member of the Intermouse!
Intermouse?
We haven't eat that yet.
Good one.
Very good one.
Padron be happy.
What did you bring us, Pedro, amigo mio?
Padron...

Soft and fat.

You friend of us!
Bravo!
Viva...!
Mishiazabu, 1314.
Who are you?
Grabowszky.
Finally!
Who did this?
Four horrible rats!
They broke in, they were looking for the plans.
They broke everything.
Even us.
Are you alright, my lady?
Ah, how rude of me. My assistant.
Tsino-san.
Thank you, I'm alright.
They tortured the professor.
Should I call a doctor?
No, thank you.
But let's not waste time.
You must take the plans!
Oh my God!
The plans!
I can't remember where I hid the plans!
But professor!
Have your head screwed on the right way!
Didn't the rats screw it enough already?
Is it a microfilm?
Yes.. yes.
I remember so.
Well then..
If I may.
How did you know where I had put it?
As easy as falling off a log.
Please, no. No falling off of anything please.
I'm sorry.
Congratulations, professor.
Genius.
Sadly we cannot compile it anymore.
You are our only hope.
Watch out!
Grabowszky!
Thankies for finding the plans for us!
Hand it over quickly or else..
..you rotten!
The building is surrounded by cats.
We have to escape professor!
Yes.. yes.
This way!
My heart...
I'm so sorry but..
I can't..
You have to!
No..
You just go!
There they are!
Now we have them!
Little mouse.
Shoot!
Shoot already or we'll lose it!
This won't anymore!
Look!
Like in the movies!
Well.
This is done.
Let's go for the film!
Grabowszky!
Are you hurt?
Not a habit of mine.
How can we get off here?
The stairs.
The building is surrounded by cats.
Then the elevator.
Professor.
Any ideas?
Of course.
Let's build a plane.
Marvellous.
May I?
What are you doing?
We also need..
aluminium tubes..
..cables..
Look for it bastards or else we can go back to the ballet hopping!
We can go, professor.
No, Grabowszky. Only you go.
Then I'll stay, too, professor!
No, miss.
Mr. Grabowszky needs you.
And..
I can't leave my lab..
..my life-long work.
Hurry!
Farewell, professor.
Please, take care of yourself!
Farewell.
Take care..
..and good luck!
Where the hell is Grabowszky?
Up there!
Shoot already!
Idiot, shoot already!
Shoot already you puss!
How do you say in Pokionian to shoot?
God knows.
Tell him 'boom, boom'.
You will have some time to..
attend tonight's party, won't you, Teufel.
Of course, Mr. director.
I will take the plans too,
with me.
Perfect.
Teufel!!
You're smoking again!
I'm so sorry Mr. director..
not anymore.
You know well that I hate cigar-smoke!
Oh, and since you're going that way anyways..
please take that Grabowszky with you, too.
I'm interested in this little mouse.
Will do, Mr. director.
Thank you, my dear little Teufel.
See you later then.
Toniiiight.
Good bye, Mr. Gatto.
Safranek!
Yes, sir.
Complete emergency, Safranek.
The plane arrives at 6 pm with Grabowszky and the plans.
We need to grab both!
Plus we need him alive!
Yes, Mr. Teufel.
Here are the detailed orders for the foremen.
Yes, Mr. Teufel.
Everybody shall be in position by 5!
You know, Safranek..
I want to make a real cat out of you!
A bloodthirsty..
sneaky..
cruel cat!
Everything will be fine, Mr. Teufel.
Good.
I will also take part in the mission.
Like in the good old days...
So until 7 pm..
you'll be substituting me.
Did you get that?
Yes, Mr. Teufel!
Well then.. go, Safranek!
Squad 4, ready.
Squad 5 on the scene.
Squad 6, ready.
Squad 7 on the appointed scene.
Squad 8 OK.
We'll get them!
Squad 8.
Open the gates!
Rockets, ready.
Everything ready, Mr. Teufel.
You can still change your mind, Edlington.
99% chance you won't get out safely.
I already decided Bob.
I trust my 1%.
Well then, good luck.
Two minutes to 6.
Well.
The ball is in play.
I'll be waiting for you in the base, if there's anything left of you.
Grabowszky will come there too.
I hope he got the notice on time.
Boss, they are coming.
Number 1, fire.
Number 2, fire.
Number 3, fire.
The left engine is on fire.
Extinguisher activated.
We'll land. Grabowszky, go.
Rain.
Go.
Everything's OK, Nick?
If you're referring to customs, yes.
Would you lend me your gun, sir?
Of course, sir.
If I may, I congratulate you, sir.
Thank you.
Welcome, Mr. Grabowszky.
This is the end of your trip.
You bill phay phor phis!
Help!
Grabowszky!
Help!
Grabowszky, help!!
Music!
Mr. Fritz Teufel.
Well, well.
Our brave Teufel.
Punctual as usual.
Greetings, Mr. director.
And here is...
Grabowszky!
And a charming surprise with it.
Bravo Teufel, bravo!
Tied up mouse.
I like it.
But let's see it up close.
Well, well. The clever little Grabowszky.
Smart. Very smart!
Teufel. Light.
And with this our victory is complete.
Isn't it so, Mr. Grabowszky?
Ladies and gentlecats..
the mice... are over!
Hoorey!
Ladies and gentlecats..
Here is the new director-in-chief of the syndicate, also my successor.
Congratulations, Fritz.
Thank you, Giovanni.
Hooray for the director! Hoorey!
Applaud Cathy!
And I want him well-cooked..
with mustard.
Do you hear that?
What's this!
Look there!
Up to the sky!
Saludos, amigos!
First work..

Si, senor Pedro.
Down there! In the cauldron!
And the last film strip..
I got it!
The assembling plan.
What an inmouse memory!
Nilsen!
When it's ready, get the plans and start production of the Cat-Catcher.
Thank you, Grabowszky.
Good job.
The rest is our responsibility.
Bob?
I would like to..
I know, you want to quit.
Well, rest a little bit for now, and then we'll talk about it.
