Hey, I can't complain.
- That never stopped him before.
- Right?

Well, we made

I gotta go

Why didn't you go
in the slingshot?
Huh?
Bomb, anything
from Piggy Island?
- Nope.
- Chuck. Anything to the north?

- Nope. Nothing.
- What's that?
Uh-oh.

Incoming pie!

Ah!

- Hey, sorry, buddy.
[GROANS]
[CHEERING]
What, what?
Yeah!
Those pigs...
Are gonna pay...
For our lunches!
Uh... Because of our hunger
to give them...
A taste of their own...
Quesadillas!
What?
[BABY GASPS]
- It's Red.
- I'm sorry, guys.
We're taking over the Blue Line.
Official business.
- Oh, yeah!
- Of course, anything for you.
BIRD:
Hey, Red!
Isn't it funny
how nobody liked you
until you saved Bird Island?
But now we all love you.
Ha. Thanks so much
for bringing that up.
Okay, ready?
- Three...
- Two...
Two!
- Bomb, you say "one."

Hey, Leonard,
you should probably...

BOMB:
Is it a per...? Is it a head?
What is that?
Oh, look. It seems like
it's some kind of note.
What if it's
a love note?
A message in a bottle?
Or a genie in a bottle.
Guys,

No, this is just another
one of their pranks.
- What?
- Huh?
This is a huge relief,
right?
Who else
was getting tired
of the pranking
and retaliation?
Me! This guy!
Tired? No, no, no.
Guys, listen.
Imagine all the fun things
we can do now.
I can think of one.
You think he'll go?
I think we've piqued
his interest.
No, no, no. Guys,
we are working tirelessly,
day and night,
to save the world.
But the world
doesn't need saving.
Of course they need us.

- Eggs.
- What?
- You said "rocks"
instead of "eggs" again.
Oh, sorry.
I don't know why

Because they are rocks.

You all know how this works.
- When you hear this sound...
- [TWEETS]
...then it's time to move on
to the next table,
where your soul mate
just might be waiting.
Yeah, I'm going home.
Absolutely not.
You have nothing else to do.
I hid your keys
on some part of my body,
and I'm not telling you
where unless you stay. Ha, ha!
Yeah, let's party!
Hey, yo!
Chuck's the name.
- Speed's the game. Like games?

Oh. Ew.

Not me.

Uh-uh. Shh.
This mating dance
is for you.
♪ Y'all ready for this? ♪

[TWEETS]
I'd love to hear
about you.
What's your favorite sign?
This one's mine.
[LAUGHS]
You know, the flavor
can vary greatly,
depending on the minerals
in the dirt.
I can tell which kind of worms
have crawled through there.
Or what sort of roly-polies used
it to raise their family in.
Um. Are you mad?
No.
- I don't know. You look mad.
- Well, I'm not.
You know what?
Maybe it's your eyebrows.
My eyebrows are fine.
That's the way I look.
It's like you've got
resting bird face.
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
that's not a thing.
- [BIRD TWEETS]
- [LAUGHING]
- BIRD: Yes! Amazing.
- BOMB: I'm not a total animal.
- But I do enjoy eating dirt.
- [SIGHS]
Okay, worms, birdseed
or just garbage
- from a dumpster?
- I'm sorry, what?
Favorite food, silly.
Don't think.
Just answer from your gut. Go!
Um. Uh, toast?
Okay. Toast.
Favorite color?
- Uh.
- Stupid question. Red, duh.
If you could have one
superpower, what would it be?
Um, to disappear,
like, right now.
Okay. What do you do
in your free time?
Yeah, I mean, I don't really
have any free time.
I kinda protect Bird Island
from being attacked,
and that's a full-time gig,
so yeah.
I thought I heard something
about a truce.
Ha, ha! No. A truce, no.
That's not gonna last.
You'll have a lot
more free time
now that nobody needs you
anymore, so...
Okay. We are done here.
Are you afraid to talk
about your feelings?
You know, just because
I don't want to talk about them
doesn't mean I'm afraid.
Okay. So avoids
personal questions.
- Unusually angry.
- Talks to herself.
- Self-esteem issues.
- Doesn't answer own questions.
Left-handed.
Probably a witch.
Looks like we're
definitely incompatible.
Oh, and you needed a form
to tell you that. Okay.
Hope you have luck
annoying the next guy.
I don't need luck.
I have a formula.
Okay. Have a nice life.
Have fun being alone.
Oh, I will.
Aw.
There he goes,
like a ship in the night.
No rudder, no purpose,
no crew.

Hello! Oh.
[SCREAMS]
Look, Red, I know
we've had our differences.
Oh, like when you tried
to eat our young?
I come in peace.
- Ouch.
- Aah!
Look, I don't want
to see your face
any more than you
want to see mine.
We're all in danger!
- Yeah. From you.
- Ouch!
No, we have a truce.
Didn't you get my note?
It was on a balloon.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You wanted to talk.
This is not how a truce works.
Just say what
you gotta say
- and then get out.
- [SQUEALS]
Red, we've discovered
that there's a third island,
and they're plotting
to destroy us all.
A third island?

[TOILET FLUSHES]

- Aah!
That image in your hand
is Eagle Island,
and those are eagles.
Eagles? How did you get these?
From a drone.
- And do you spy on us with that?
- Yes.
So have you seen me...?
Yes, and it's disgusting.
Red, this is bigger than pranks.
We need to put aside our
differences and work together.
To save our whole world
from being destroyed.
CROWD [CHANTING]:
Red! Red! Red!
Red! Red! Red!
Red! Red! Red!
What we really need is a hero.
I'm in.
Wonderful!
We'll have to get
a team together.
RED:
Yes, we will.
But, hey, I'm in charge.
Actually, that position's
been filled.
- Boo-yah!
- Uh.
Yeah. By me.
Oh, man, you're gonna
love this guy.
Not the smartest bird
in the tree,
but what he lacks in smarts,
he makes up for in firepower.
Achoo!
- Happy birthday!
- Aah!
BIRD: We've got a number
two at the Porta Potty.

- You're still grounded!

- Ha, ha, great!
- But how did you...?
BT-dubs,
you misspelled "heist."
It's "E-I,"
I corrected it.
Don't worry.
It's a common misperception.
Well, thank you.
- [LAUGHS]
- You're right. He's fast.
[LAUGHS]
RED: Now,
this guy is kind of a ding-dong,
but he's the only
eagle we know.
Well, you've come
to the right eagle.
Tell me more.
It's a really exciting mission
to a place called Eagle...
- Eagle Island?
- Yes.
So you've heard...
- [YELLING]
- CHUCK: Heard of it.
Nice to meet you!
Okay, so now we just need
to figure out
how this volcanic
super-weapon works, huh?
We're gonna need some kind
of engineering wizard, brainiac.
- Hm.
- Hm.
Oh!
[VOCALIZING]
Yes, Chuck. You obviously
have something
you want to say or sing.
I have got just the guy.
It's a girl.
My sister Silver.
She goes to Avian Academy,
top of her class.
- She would be perfect.
- Yeah, she totally would.
- BIRD 1: See you at the dorm!
- BIRD 2: Yeah, see you, Ella.
BIRD 3:
Hey, good catch!
I mean, we all just thought
she was weird, you know?
She skipped four grades,
won an Engineer
of the Year Award,
and got a scholarship
at Avian Academy.
Perfect. That is exactly
what we're looking for.
You are absolutely
gonna love her.
But don't love her too much.
That's my sister, Red.
[IN DEEP VOICE] Or I'll crush
every bone in your body!
[NORMALLY]
Oh. Frisbee!
Hi, I'm Chuck. Know where
the Engineering department is?
SILVER: With a combination
of over 30 silk,
wire and cotton-based
threads spun together,
I now present to you...
Super String!
[SNORING]
[CLEARS THROAT]
I said, "It's Super String!"
More like
"Stupid String."
I know what
you're thinking, Mike.
You're like,
"What's so super about it?"
Great question, Mike.
Well, how about that
it's very easily able
to withstand the pull
of 18,000 more kilos
than any other string known to...
[BELL RINGS]
BIRD:
Snooze alert.

Or pig-kind,

says your name.
Hello? You in here?
Hello?
- You?
- You?
You.
Wait. You know this guy?
[MUFFLEDLY] I would
answer, but you jinxed me.
Oh, okay, Chuck,
I unjinx you.
This is one of my best buddies,
Red. These are the guys.
- Hi.
- We're the guys.
Guys, this is Silver,
the greatest kid sister
in the world.
I'm not exactly
a kid anymore, Chuck.
Oh, you'll always be
my kid sister!
Okay. Hey, everyone.
You know, I don't think
this is gonna work.
It's just that
I'm not sure
you're gonna be compatible
with the team.
Oh, wow, it is such a pleasure
to meet not you, but you!
I've never met
a pig before.
Your technological achievements
are amazing.
- May I shake your hoof?
- Why, thank you.
I like her.
- And this has to be Bomb.

What do you mean
by that?
Well, normally,
when things are this easy,
some dramatically
unexpected setback occurs.
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.
Well, it's kind
of hard to explain.
But it's sort of like,
you know how some...?
Oh, see? Like that.
Are you freaking
kidding me?

LEONARD: Each of you has
been selected because
you're the best
in your field.
- ALL: Oh.
- LEONARD: That we could find.
ALL:
Oh.
Your skills will be
put to the test
facing this.
As you can clearly see,
this is a vol...
Volcano.
"A volcano" is what
my assistant
was going to say.
- You're the assistant!
- Let go. Let go.
- No, I'm the leader.
- I'll take that.
[CLEARS THROAT] Actually,
it's a composite volcano.
You can tell
by the height
and the apparent
vent clusters.
Okay, forget I said "volcano."
This is a...
It's a super-weapon!
[ALL GASP]
Weird, because it looks
just like a volcano.
Yep, and here's
the scary part.
This is their
psychotic leader!
[ALL GASP]
Ooh! How'd that get
in there? Ha, ha. Next.
- Oh, butt shot.
- Next. No. Next. Next!

This is their

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Buddy, do you know her?
What? Me? No.
No, definitely not,
absolutely not.
Never seen her
before in my life.
Who is that? I don't know!
Not terribly convincing,
but moving on.
Great.
What's the plan?
All right, here's what
we're looking at, folks.
Step one: Travel undetected
to Eagle Island.
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh.
Step two: We're gonna break
into the super-weapon.
- Got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And step three:
Ooh, ooh.
Deactivate the superweapon.
Once we break in there...
SILVER [WHISPERS]:
No plan...
hopefully, before both islands
are destroyed and we all die,
so that's, uh... That's it.
Right. So I just have
a few questions.
Why? I explained everything.
It's a foolproof plan.
Yeah. How do we sneak
onto the island?
What is the super-weapon
and how do we deactivate it?
And when you say "escape,"
how do you plan to do that?
This is a crucial
thing to figure out.
I agree.
Why isn't she in charge?
Told you she's super smart.
Hey, guys,
hold on a second, please.
- Mighty Eagle?
- What? What are you looking at?
Do you have
an Eagle Island map?
What? No. No, there's no map.
- Oh, it's a map.
- RED: Yeah, that's a map.
Mm-hm. Okay,
I just wanna read it.
Wait a minute.
Do you guys hear that?
Do we hear what?
Sounds like a, um,
like a whistle.
It almost sounds like a:

Glenn, you didn't mess
it up this time.
- Boom! Up top. Or not.
- Nailed it!
Jerry, up top.
That should send him running.
Wait. "Him"?
Who you sending running?
Yeah. Who's "him"?
"Them." I said "them."
Stop asking me stupid questions.
I'm so sorry.
- Wow.
- That was crazy.
We could have died.
Thanks for saving our lives,
Mighty Eagle!
Well, you can always

- I'm sorry. Saving everyone?
- Yeah.

Maybe because there's
too many birds.

Wait a minute.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why isn't anybody leaving?
Why they not scared?
Okay. Oh, okay, okay.
Here's what we gonna do.
I want y'all to take
all of those ice balls
and fill them up with... Ha, ha...
Molten lava.
That's not possible.
What? You never heard
of thermal emulsifiers?
Well, yes, yes.
You just got to get
a polyacrylamide
to enhance the nanoparticle
and surfactant association
between the two materials.
Uh. Okay.
So you do that,
and I'm gonna go feed my baby.
Yes, I'm finally gonna
feed my baby.
There you go.
Who's my baby?
You're my baby.

Red here has got your back.
And your front

And my floof?
Yeah, even your cute

Looks like
you're gonna be okay.
So are you 100 percent sure
we shouldn't evacuate?
No, Red's gonna take care

Yes! Everybody, please,
just stay calm.
Great news!
Thank you!
We're gonna be okay.
Red's here.

This is it?
This is the amazing team
I've been working around

Ha, ha. Working with
what we got.
[SLURPS]
Well, that's disappointing.
Wow. Okay.
This is the part
where you get up and follow me!
Welcome to my

Oh, yeah.
GARRY: Everywhere you
look, you'll see inventions
being tested
by my team of guinea pigs.
- SILVER: Oh. This is so cool.
- BOMB: I know. Right?
GARRY: All the gadgets have
been designed specifically
with your current mission
in mind.
The first being Invisa-Spray.
Need to go undetected
in plain sight?
Invisa-Spray does
exactly that.
Wow, I'm invisible!
ALL:
Whoa.
"Whoa," indeed.
That's amazing.
How long does
the invisibility last for?
- Forever.
- Wait. What?
- [RINGS]
- Tina, we're not gonna be able
to see each other tonight.
And what does the next
gadget do? Bury us alive?
What? That would be ridiculous.
[WHISPERS, IN PIG LATIN]

- [CHUCK & BOMB LAUGHING]
- What are you guys doing?
This is so fun!
Oh, it's so squishy.
What is this stuff?
Oh, well,
that is a special type
of flame retardant
we call pig snot.
Why do you call it...?
You know what? Never mind.
Ugh.
[GRIMACING]
[ALL GROAN]
Yeah! Lick it.
Now, everyone,
prepare yourselves
'cause this next one
is really something special.
Whoa. So shiny.
Yes, my friend. Bold yet sleek.
Simple while complex.
This device can detect
an eagle anywhere
within a 100-foot radius.

- Well, how does it work?
- Simply push this button,
and it does the rest.

- no doubt prove to be...
- There's an eagle nearby.
- crucial during your mission.
- There's an eagle nearby.
- Wonderful. That's amazing!
- There's an eagle nearby.
- Can you turn it off?
- There's an eagle nearby.
- It'll turn itself off.
- There's an eagle nearby.
[SIGHS]
Oh, thank goodness.
One hour after it doesn't
detect any more eagles.
- What?
- There's an eagle nearby.
- There's an eagle nearby.
- Hey! Hey!
There's an eagle near...
- There.
- Oh, thank you.
Okay, guys,
these gadgets are terri...
Hey, hey, Red,
can we chat for a sec?
I can tell you're used
to running the show.
That's great and all. But maybe
since we're all a team here,
a team you put together,
maybe you can try
to be more supportive.
The results might
surprise you, huh?
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
Garry. Woo. Unbelievable.
Really, really good stuff.
You know what? I'm sure
I can figure out a plan to...
You know,

I need you to pull it.
That will create
a ramp so
when Red and I roll down
in the ice ball,
we'll be launched
through the air
at the perfect trajectory
to take out the super-weapon.
- Got it?
- LEONARD: Now you're talking.
Great plan, Silver.
Mama would be so proud.
Okay, everyone put
your wings and hooves in.
ALL:
Go, team!

Chuck, let us know when
you've disabled the cameras.
Okay. On it.

Uh... It says

You know, he's heavier than me.
Too slow. You're perfect.
Oh, that's funny.
I thought we weren't compatible.

Oh, Terence, this is like our

Flowers for you,
flowers for you.
RED:
Ladies and gentlemen,
birds and pigs,
we are gathered here today
because of these two characters.
Not only because they're being
joined in holy matrimony,
but also because one of them
tried to destroy our islands
for her own selfish reasons.

Oh, it's such
a beautiful wedding.
It really is.
But Mighty Eagle swooped
in at the last second
and got all the credit
for stopping her.
Yes, you did, baby.

Thank you for this. And for
all the support and love.
You know, it means...
Well, it means everything to me.
But, um, I don't deserve it.
She does.
What just happened?
Is that the nerd
from our physics class?
This is the real hero
right here.
Silver is the one
who came up
with the plan
to stop the super-weapon
and ultimately saved
all our lives.
Red, I didn't do this
all on my own.
Right. Because we're a team.
We couldn't have
done anything without
Chuck and Bomb,
- or Courtney and Garry.
- Thank you.
RED: Or Leonard.
Actually, we probably
could've done it
without Leonard.
Let's be honest, huh?
Leonard's the man!
I did everything!
I got the sub!
And even Mighty Eagle.
