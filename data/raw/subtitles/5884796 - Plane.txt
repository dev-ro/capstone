- This is gonna be rough.
- Yep.
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, Daniela.
I'm rushing to security.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, we're fine.
Just checking in.
- Sorry.
- Are you gonna make it?
Yeah, I think med-checks
should go quickly.
I meant make it here
before midnight.
You're still in Singapore.
Well, Hawaii is 18 hours behind.
It's just over six hours to
Tokyo. Another six to Honolulu.
So, I'll be there
with plenty of time to spare.
New year's Eve. One delay...
Hey, hey.
There won't be any delays.
Hold on.
Hey, sorry. I'm running late
this morning.
I just need to scan your badge,
and we'll get you
through quickly.
Thank you.
Now, tell your aunt Carrie I'm
expecting some homemade haggis,
neeps, and tatties
waiting for me, all right?
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.
Hey, dad.
I'm really glad
that we're doing this.
And I'm sorry that it's taken
so long for us to be together.
Brodie don't apologize. I know
you have a busy life at school.
Yeah, thanks to you.
That's my job, sweetheart.
I wouldn't have it
any other way.
Well, almost.
- Captain torrance?
- Yeah, sorry I'm late.
It's fine, sir. The flight officer
hasn't even come by yet.
- Good.
- Oh. Samuel dele.
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Happy new year.
- And to you.
- Where are you from?
- Uh, Hong Kong, sir.
Did my training at the
civil aviation department.
Oh, yeah.
I hear that's a great academy.
And you, sir?
English, I'm guessing?
Hell, no.
I wouldn't lower myself.
- Nope. I'm Scottish.
- Oh.
Although I did fly
raf transport years ago.
Back then, all the sexy assignments
went to the English blokes.
I didn't mind, though,
because for me,
the heavies were an easy path
into the airlines.
Well, it looks like they're
pushing us through weather.
Of course they are.
Gentlemen, let's see.
One-hundred and nineteen,
fourteen passengers.
Everything cleared.
Any questions?
Yeah. Looks like we're pushing
through some serious weather.
It's converging here
over the south China sea.
We're aware of it.
By the time you get there,
- it should have moved inland.
- What if it sits there and stews?
We can push out east,
come north over luzon?
That adds an hour
and 18k in fuel.
The flight's nearly empty,
so we need to shorten.
Take it to 37.
You'll clear that weather.
Good flight. Happy new year.
Happy new year.
Do our iPads control
the weather like his does?
There you go.
Hello, gentlemen.
My name's Bonnie.
I'll be your chief tonight.
- Oh. Nice to meet you, Bonnie.
- Good to meet you.
Um, captain,
you're needed in the jetway.
- Okay.
- See you soon, cap.
Captain torrance, flight
commander. How can I help you?
Fugitive extradition to Toronto.
We'll be with you
as far as Tokyo.
He'll remain in constraints and
be under my constant supervision.
Well, is he dangerous?
What did he do?
Homicide. 15 years ago.
Wasn't expecting that.
We found him in Bali
under an alias.
And he's been around,
I'll say that.
Yeah, this is a bare flight. You're
gonna attract a lot of attention.
I don't wanna scare
the rest of the passengers.
I'm afraid
you're stuck with us, captain.
All right.
Just keep away
from everyone else, please.
Copy that.
Let's go.
- Did you check the back there?
- Everything is set back there.
Evening, ladies.
- Evening, captain.
- Evening. How are you?
- Ah, Isabella, how are you?
- Hey. Good.
- Yeah.
- Good, good.
- Maria. Pleasure.
- Hi, Maria. Yeah.
Brodie torrance.
We're all ready to get out
of Singapore?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Let's go.
Okay.
Okay, confirming 14 passengers.
Fourteen passengers.
New year's light.
I'm sure everybody's seen
our special guest at the back?
- Louis gaspare, 35b.
- Mmm-hmm.
What did he do?
I'm sure
the less we know, the better.
You know, just keep your interactions
with him to a minimum. That's all.
- All right? Good.
- Yep.
So, we're gonna get
this new year started?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.
All right. Get 'em on board.
Let's have a good flight.
- Okay.
- Same to you.
- How you doing?
- Hi, there.
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.
Yeah, just back there.
- Happy new year.
- Thanks.
- Hi. Happy new year.
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.
- Thank you.
- Hi. Happy new year.
- I'm not gonna resend it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- They've seen his face.
- Happy new year.
They've... they've seen it. I...
- Gary, I can't make them sign.
- Hi, happy new year.
- Hey.
- Happy new year.
- Hey, how are you?
- I can't make them sign.
- How're you doing?
- That's your...
Hello. Happy new year.
- D-f, just right here.
- Hello.
You gotta be kidding me?
How'd you get an upgrade?
Trailmiles.
I've gotta sit
on my own, in coach.
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.
They should tell you
when you buy your ticket
- how old the plane will be.
- No kidding.
Oh, no need to worry, folks.
These planes
are pretty much indestructible.
Hey, girls.
Happy new year.
- Hi.
- Hi, hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- I think that's everybody.
- Yeah. Good.
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.
Excuse me, ladies.
That's far enough.
But these are our seats.
I'm in 34d.
It's fine, ladies.
That row there is all yours.
Okay.
Do you wanna sit by the window?
Yeah, thanks.
- Ma'am, can I help you?
- Oh, thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
- make sure your seats...
- Excuse me.
- Are in an upright position...
- Thanks.
That your seatbelts
are fully fastened
and any carry-on items
you have are fully stowed.
Once again, thank you
for flying trailblazer.
- Set to Max.
- Takeoff trail.
Trim set for takeoff.
And flight controls.
Flight controls, free and clear.
Check is complete.
Passengers
all tucked in, captain.
All right, let's close it up.
Thanks, Bonnie.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to trailblazer
flight 119.
This is your captain speaking.
If your next stop is Tokyo,
then you're in the right place.
If you're not going to Tokyo,
then you're about to have
a really long morning.
Flight time this evening
is six hours and thirty minutes.
And luckily, I know a shortcut,
so we might be there a little early.
We'll be taking off
just as soon as I learn
a few pages of this
flight manual. Thank you.
Ready for pushback?
- Ready for pushback.
- Make the call.
- No point to stress about it.
- That's true...
Air traffic controller
on radio: Trailblazer 119,
you're clear to taxi
runway zero-two left.
Trailblazer 119,
Roger that.
Taxiing runway zero-two left.
This is one view
that never gets old.
Trailblazer 119 in position,
ready for takeoff.
Trailblazer 119,
you are cleared for takeoff.
Maintain runway heading,

Fly runway heading.
Climb and maintain 2,000.
Trailblazer 119.
Takeoff power is set.
Airspeed alive.

Copy departure.
Trailblazer 119.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.
We've reached our cruising
altitude of 37,000 feet.
If there's anything you need...
Sir, would you care
for some almonds?
Please don't hesitate to ask.
We at trailblazer
appreciate you spending
your new year's day with us.
Thank you.
Hey, do you want
to take a picture with him?
- What?
- A picture.
Come on.
- Could you not do that?
- Sorry.
Beautiful family.
Thank you. Just...
It's a juggle.
But we make it work.
How about you, cap?
- Do you have a family?
- Yeah, I have a daughter.
Actually, here. Here she is.
Daniela.
I see the resemblance.
You think?
- And where's home?
- Daniela goes to college in California.
And, uh, I'm based
out of Singapore.
The distance must be quite
challenging for you and your wife, no?
Well, my wife actually passed
three years ago.
- I'm so sorry, captain.
- No, no.
Thank you. Nah, it's okay.
- Happy new year.
- Oh, thank you.
What can I
get for you, sir?
Uh, gin.
Do you need any tonic
or soda water?
Just gin. Just the gin.
We're cutting right through
the top of the storm.
So much for "moving inland."
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.
The seatbelt signs
have been turned on.
Please remain in your seats with
your seatbelts secure. Thank you.
Trailblazer 119, requesting
climb to 40,000 to clear weather.
Tsn control, this is trailblazer
119 requesting flight climb
to 40,000 feet
to clear weather. Copy?
Comms here are not so good.
Tcas is clear of traffic.
Tsn control,
this is trailblazer 119.
Climbing to 40,000 to
clear weather, in the blind.
Trailblazer 119, clear to 40,000.
Copy, tsn. Trailblazer 119
level at 40,000.
New year's crew, huh?
Whoa.
What was that?
Okay.
I'm gonna check
on the passengers.
- You have control.
- I have control.
Nothing to worry about, folks.
Just some weather.
- Here, Bonnie. You okay?
- Oh. Yes.
What was that?
Sorry, folks. Just going
through some weather.
Is this yours?
- That's mine.
- Oh. Here you go.
Thank you.
He's great with the jokes,
but can he fly the damn plane?
We're doing
the best we can, sir.
Hey, can I at least get a towel?
We'll get you one
just as soon as we can.
What happened? Are you okay?
Oh. All good.
Just a scratch.
All right.
Listen, keep everybody
in their seats.
No exceptions. All right?
Strap 'em in tight.
Yes, sir.
Bonnie,
stay in your seat.
What's happening?
Captain,
avionics are down.
- I have control.
- Copy that.
- Check breakers and reset.
- Resetting.
Tsn, this is trailblazer 119.
Do you copy?
Unresponsive. There's no power.
Avionics must be fried. Shit.
Is anyone on this channel?
Please respond.
Trailblazer 119, flying blind.
Lightning strike.
Avionics down. We are dark.
Does anyone have our position?
Radio is dead. Resetting.
System failure.
We're not transmitting.
We're on straight battery.
That gives us 10 minutes to put
her down before we lose power
and drop
into uncontrolled descent.
Stopwatch.
What?
Call it out, dele.
One minute at a time, okay?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay. Manual nav.
Last marked position?
427, south southwest of Manila,
heading zero-three-zero.
Given speed and heading,
we should be about here.
The storm's heading northeast.
We won't make Manila.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is trailblazer 119.
Descending from 40,000 feet.
No radar, no navigation,
no antenna, no adi.
Please respond.
Oh, my god.
Avionics are fried, Bonnie.
It's about to get very rough.
Okay, okay, okay.
This is not happening.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had...
Ladies and gentlemen, we've
had an electrical malfunction
and I need everyone to have
their seatbelts securely fastened!
We're gonna be forced to fly
through some severe weather!
- What happened?
- An electrical malfunction!
I need everyone's seatbelts
to be fully fastened!
Captain.
- Time?
- Eight minutes.
We're gonna lose the moon.
Keep your eyes on the gyro.
Call it out.
Get ready to take the controls
if anything happens.
That's hail.
Now it's a party.
Shit. We gotta
punch through this storm
and see where we come out.
My phone.
- It's not going through.
- Neither is mine.
Come on, baby.
Hold tight. Hold tight.
Oh, my god. Help!
Can you take off the cuffs?
I can't swim.
Not a chance.
Go ahead, go ahead.
I got you. I got you.
The goddamn plane
is falling apart!
Shit!
- Sir, you must take your seat.
- Sir? Sir? Sit down.
Stay here. Stay here,
Isabella. Just stay.
- Just stay seated.
- Sit down!
- Sit down!
- Sit down!
Isabella!
Oh, my god!
Whoa.
Could you help her?
Time?
Five minutes and forty seconds.
Come on.
Come on, break through.
Oh, fuck.
There you go.
Time?
Four minutes
and thirty seconds.
Okay.
Can you see land anywhere?
Please, sir, sit down.
Everyone stay
in their seats, please.
Captain,
what do I tell the passengers?
Never thought
I would ever have to say this.
Prepare to ditch.
Okay.
Attention, everyone!
I need you to brace for impact!
The plane is equipped
with flotation devices.
- We're gonna crash.
- And once we are down,
I will give you
further instruction!
- Maria, do you hear me?
- Where are we landing?
Yes, copy that!
Brace for impact!
Those white caps
don't look too welcoming.
Time?
Three minutes.
All right, dele.
Let's give this our best shot.
On my command,
we're gonna turn into the wind
and we're gonna come in
parallel to the swells,
so we touch down slow and level.
Okay?
You see that? Over there?
That's fucking land.
Feet dry. Any clue where we are?
We should be somewhere
around here.
Too low terrain.
Too low terrain.
That's still working.
Captain, 90 seconds.
She'll give us more.
What's going on?
We can't be landing here.
Twenty seconds.
We might be better off
over the water.
Out of time.
There!
That's a road. Time?
Ten seconds past zero.
Are you...
That's a fucking road.
- Flaps full.
- Flaps full.
Fuel jettison.
Visually confirming fuel dump,
my side.
Nothing here.
Right side failure.
Trying again.
- Negative.
- Fuck.
We're a stick of dynamite.
Manually extend gear. Hurry.
Landing gear extended
and locked.
- Low terrain.
- Shut up.
No. No.
Speed brakes extended.
Reverse full thrust.
Reverse full thrust.
- Help me with the brakes, dele.
- On it.
Okay.
Everything off.
How... how did you...
One minute at a time.
Right, dele?
Fuck.
Hell, we still got fuel.
And a hot plane.
Let's get everyone off now.
Let's go.
Dele,
get everybody in the front.
Get me the hell off
this damn plane.
Everybody okay?
Quiet, please.
Everybody, listen up!
I need everybody
off the plane now!
Which way are we going?
Everybody, quiet. Go to
the front. Go to the front.
I need you all
off this plane now!
I just wanna know what...
- Don't worry about your stuff.
- You need to breathe.
Get moved to the front.
Okay, just breathe.
- Bonnie?
- Two!
We have two. Sir, two.
- Okay, just go.
- Okay, come on. Move, move.
Let's calmly exit the plane.
Everybody, stay calm.
Let me through.
- Hurry, Bonnie.
- Oh, yes.
In a single line,
come on through. Come on.
Be calm! Go! Move, move.
Please move to the side.
Please move to the side.
Okay, sit down.
Fold your arms, like this.
Arms crossed, sit down.
- Flight 119.
- Uh, I'll call you.
What do we know, Sydney?
Well, sir, we lost it
somewhere west of the Philippines.
- Lost?
- The plane requested a higher altitude
at 5:16 A.M. local.
Nineteen minutes, 23 seconds
later, all communication stopped.
Manila atc had them on radar
until 5:43 A.M. local
when the plane dipped below
20,000 feet and lost all contact.
Get me David scarsdale,
right now.
Um, we have some cuts
and bruises,
but, um, I think everyone's
just pretty rattled.
Anyone have cell service?
No. No one.
What do we do
about the prisoner?
I don't know. That's
a new one for me.
Um...
I saw him eyeing the
officer's keys, so I took them.
Is he dangerous?
He's being extradited
on a murder charge.
The officer...
The officer said, yeah,
he might be dangerous.
Look, we just keep an eye on him
and keep him separate
from the other passengers, okay?
Just try your best.
- Okay.
- All right.
Here. I think
you should hold on to these.
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.
Yeah, okay.
Water... just nowhere.
- What's going on?
- Tell us something.
Yeah.
We need information.
Can we please
get some real answers?
- There's gotta be some thing...
- Okay, everybody...
Everybody... listen, listen up.
I want to thank you all
for your cooperation.
I'm sorry for what
we just had to go through,
and I know
you all have questions.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So, here's the situation.
We got hit by lightning
and our main power
and comms are down.
Okay, so, as of now,
there's no way
of calling for help.
- What? You're kidding.
- No way? No way?
What I need everybody
to do right now, listen up...
- How come?
- Is remain calm.
All right? Once the plane
cools down,
we're gonna get back on there,
we're gonna get our things,
get some water
and we're gonna figure out
what we're gonna do.
Do you know where we are?
Yeah, we think
that we're near davao
in the southern Philippines.
- You think?
- We think.
- Very reassuring.
- Rest assured,
me and the crew are gonna do
everything we can to make sure
that we get you
out of here safely.
All right? Okay. Thank you.
Okay, come on.
- Hey, Terry.
- Hey.
Everyone,
this is David scarsdale.
He specializes in corporate
strategy and crisis management.
- Happy new year.
- Let's hope so.
Is this
the last point of contact?
Yes, it is.
That's a hell of a storm.
What idiot sent them
flying through that?
It's airline protocol.
Flight was light. It was
the most efficient route.
I thought
they could fly above it.
You thought? What, are you
a fucking meteorologist, too?
How much fuel did you save?
About $12,000.
Well, congratulations. That's
barely tip money on this deal.
The clock is ticking.
Every minute matters.
If that plane ditched at sea,
or crash landed,
we can count those minutes
in lives lost or saved. Got it?
Okay, so, what can I do?
Call the military? Us assets?
What are your best options?
Well, in that part of the world,
there's only one option
right now.
What's that?
You're gonna want
the lawyers out of here.
It's fine. Tell me.
Private assets.
I'm already into it.
- Mercenaries?
- Terry...
The Philippines
are not the amalfi coast.
Now, I need a group working
on press releases
for every possible scenario.
A ghosting like Malaysia 370.
A crash landing
with no survivors.
A hijacking with demands.
If you have plans for new
year's Eve, I just canceled them.
A little further.
Yeah, right to the end.
- Tight as we can.
- Yeah.
Why can't we just stay inside
the plane?
It's safe and dry.
Well, that's a good question,
mister, uh...
Sinclair. Matt sinclair.
Well, without air conditioning,
that plane
is gonna cook in the sun.
So, we're better off out here,
with the shelter and a breeze.
Hey, while you're there,
you wanna step in,
help secure that, Matt sinclair?
Okay, if you're in your bags,
you find anything like,
uh, bug spray, sunscreen,
food, please share. All right?
Mr. Gaspare.
Well...
Looks like we've got ourselves
in a bit of a mess here.
And so,
I'm not quite sure what
we're supposed to do with you.
To be honest, I'm a bit
surprised you're still here.
You think I'm fucking stupid
enough to try and escape
in a jungle I don't know?
In handcuffs?
Unless you're offering.
I don't think I can do that.
Then we have
nothing to talk about.
Shit.
This is what happens
when a 40-amp fuse
gets hit with enough juice
to light a city.
Check it out, man.
What about the radio?
Let's see here. Oh, no.
It's fried, melted.
And the transponder?
It's hard to tell
without the power.
If we could reroute
the isolation bus
to the essential bus,
we could draw down more amps
from the battery.
In theory.
Captain, plane's fully unloaded
except for the, uh,
bodies and their personals.
- I'll handle it.
- Okay.
- Hey, Bonnie.
- Yeah?
Sorry about Isabella.
- What are you doing, man?
- You know what they say.
No video, didn't happen.
Here we all are.
Alone, in the jungle.
No idea of how
we're gonna get out.
Survivors of the worst
fucking plane ride
in the history
of bad plane rides.
There's our lovely plane that
decided to fall out of the sky.
Trailblazer.
Never flying this again.
There's our snacks.
They're gonna last us
about an hour.
Zero-sixteen.
Carried that course
for 13 minutes.
So, assuming
the transponder went down
with the lightning strike...
Let's do the math.
That's 17 minutes,
300 miles per hour.
So, multiplying
that out, that's...
Shit.
That's over a thousand
square miles' search radius.
It'll take a miracle
to find us here.
Captain. This island here? Jolo?
It's very, very bad.
- What...
- It's run
by separatists and criminals.
There's no government or police.
If this is where we landed,
we're not safe.
All right, we tell Bonnie.
But let's keep this
to ourselves for now.
And then there's this guy,
Mr. Mysterious.
Very friendly.
- No, no, no.
- Captain!
Keep me out
of your fucking videos!
Hey, did you hit
your head? Are you okay?
Maria, can you please
get the medic bag?
Yep.
I'm gonna need you to do an
on-camera hit for the press, Terry.
We'll have a statement prepared,
but you'll need to take questions, too.
Shouldn't we wait till we know
a little bit more?
If we wait until we know more, it
looks like you're hiding something.
Just show
your concern, be humble.
- You know the drill.
- Got it.
Here you go.
You, Mr. Fuckin' weatherman.
Time to redeem yourself.
I need everything
on that aircraft.
Flight times, maintenance logs.
Names of the techs
who last serviced the plane.
- Everything.
- Yes, sir. Got it.
You sure about this, captain?
No.
But we're running pretty low
on options.
Look, I'm not tying him up.
If he runs, at least he's away
from the others, right?
All right.
Let's go and break it
to the others.
All right, everybody. Listen up.
So, here's our situation.
Mr. Dele and I,
from our calculations,
we believe that we have landed
on an island
somewhere in the sulu cluster.
We don't know which island.
The problem is the area
between where the transponder
was struck by lightning
to here is so vast
that search and rescue
could take some time.
- Jesus Christ.
- How long is it gonna take?
We're also gonna have to ration
food and water.
What's your next move?
Smoke signals?
Can you just keep it
to yourself?
Cut him a break.
At least he landed the plane.
We didn't crash.
We're in the middle
of nowhere though.
- We're stranded.
- Yeah, come on, man.
We didn't crash, man.
Listen, last night, we
flew over some kind of facility.
I'm hoping they have a phone
or a radio.
If I can get there,
make contact,
we could be rescued in hours.
Until then, I need everybody
to be careful
because we don't know
what's going on in that jungle.
- I'll go with you.
- I will come, too.
I appreciate it.
But Mr. Gaspare
has kindly volunteered to come.
What?
You're taking a guy
in handcuffs?
Makes sense.
Come on.
Datu!
Datu!
Datu!
Well, we're doing everything
we possibly can
to find flight 119,
sparing no expense.
Have you determined
that the plane has crashed?
Uh, no, that's not
the assumption.
- We have very little...
- You sure it's dad's flight?
- We are coordinating...
- I'm sure.
The search and rescue
efforts in the region.
No.
As soon as we have
some updates,
hopefully some positive news,
we'll get right back to you.
I peeked through
your officer's bag for supplies.
I came across your pocketknife.
You former military
or something'?
Groupe des
commandos parachutistes.
French foreign legion.
Pay and benefits suck,
but they don't ask any questions
if you can hack it.
Questions?
Nothing's black
and white, captain.
I was just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.
No one cares
what really happened.
I was 18 and fucked.
So, rather than, uh, rot in
prison, I ran, joined the legion.
End of story.
How'd you get caught?
Forget it. Doesn't matter.
Now let me ask you something.
Did you bring my knife?
Sorry, no.
I left it in the bag.
How about
the dead officer's gun?
We should
be getting close about now.
Brodie torrance.
Scottish, UK citizen.
Royal air force.
Then flew commercial
for 20 years.
New York to London,
Paris, Tokyo. Hot-shit routes.
Since then, he's been flying
Egypt, meridiana, frontier
and trailblazer,
flying shit third-tier routes.
- Why? What happened?
- Check the video file.
Hey, where's my drink?
- Oh, Jesus.
- I asked you for a drink,
like, 10 minutes ago.
What do you want?
Get out of here.
Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell is going...
Can this get any worse?
That's right. That's right.
I like this guy.
Holy shit.
Fuck. Okay.
John shellback,
it's David scarsdale.
What's your status?
We're prepping to load now.
Should be in the air 0900.
Please, scardy, tell me
we're going back to Macau.
File a flight plan for Manila,
and we'll see
how things shake out.
Are you telling me
you have no idea
where this plane actually is?
It's not in Macau.
I can tell you that.
That's gonna be extra, scardy.
That's going to be extra.
Happy fuckin' new year.
Out.
They're on their way.
They'll reach the area
in about three hours,
then parachute in once
we get the plane's location.
So, how much
in the emergency fund?
Half million.
Great. That might be enough
to get one of us
- out of Indonesian prison.
- Here.
- Are we good, boys?
- Good now. There you go, boss.
One, eight...
Welcome
to trailblazer airlines.
- This is Carmen.
- Carmen, listen carefully.
This is an emergency.
I'm captain Brodie torrance.
Trailblazer 119.
We've gone down on an island
in the sulu sea.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
My name
is captain Brodie torrance.
And I'm the captain
of trailblazer 119.
Now, we've gone down.
We made a crash landing on...
Sir, we've been
getting crank calls
- all day about this.
- No. Hello?
I hear you. I'm here.
Now, I need you to patch me
through to emergency ops immediately.
Listen, we've been getting
calls all day about this.
- Just shut up and listen.
- Calm down, sir.
- We've been getting...
- Sorry.
Crank calls all day long
about this disappearance.
Now, can you tell me
your employee badge number.
Fuck.
I don't actually have
my badge on me, Carmen.
- I need you to believe me on this.
- Sir, without your badge...
- Carmen.
- Sir...
- Can you hear what I'm saying?
- I can hear you.
- Our flight has gone down.
- Without your badge number...
I'm the captain of trail...
Hello?
Nail the badge
to my fucking head.
All right, Daniela.
Don't let me down.
Hello?
Daniela? Thank god.
Hey, can you hear me?
- Now, listen. Don't...
- Dad? Is that you?
- Yes, sweetheart. It's me.
- You're okay?
- Dad.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
Now, don't talk. Just listen,
'cause we might cut out, okay?
Quick. Grab something
to write with.
- Dani?
- Not now, aunt Carrie.
- Is that your dad? Dani.
- Yes, yes!
- Where are you, Brodie?
- Okay, I got it.
We've gone down, all right?
I want you to write what I say,
and get it to trailblazer immediately.
Okay.
All right, we're on an island
somewhere in the jolo cluster
in the sulu sea.
Now, we have no radio.
And I don't know
what island we're on.
Wait, no, stop!
- Dad!
- Wait!
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
You can come out, captain.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Drink it all. Hurry.
We gotta move.
Are you okay?
No.
Would you rather
that be you?
- No.
- That's it, then.
You Bury it all.
Deal with shit later.
Reach anyone?
Yes.
But we can't depend on it.
I got cut off.
It's loaded.
Slip the safety and shoot.
Lucky for you,
I snuck up on these guys.
I got a feeling
we're gonna see a lot more.
Hey. Hey. Come here.
Look.
Hey, they've got passports here.
Filipino, UK.
Hey, torrance.
Look here.
Mark and Maria Burnham.
Missionaries with
the good samaritan fellowship.
Holy shit.
$200,000 needs to be prepared
in cash by tomorrow.
They say instructions
to follow for that
by tomorrow or they're...
They're gonna kill us.
I gotta get to the passengers.
Ah, shit.
Come on.
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.
Someone's coming.
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!
We're here.
Yes! We're here!
Hey, get back. Get back!
Get back, get back.
We don't know who it is.
We don't know who it is.
- Get back! Get back in!
- Come on.
- Hey, hey!
- Stop!
Hear that? Stop the truck.
What?
What the fuck
is the matter with...
Oh, shit.
Where is captain?
I'm in charge.
Hey, hey.
Give list. Passenger list.
Oh, shit. Yeah,
I've gotta go in there.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Passenger list.
Captain Brodie torrance?
Captain torrance isn't here.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop.
He went...
He went looking for help.
- Help where?
- I don't know!
Just a phone, a radio!
So, no one know you're here?
No!
Oh.
Oh, my god.
Passport.
Get on bus, now!
Go! Move!
Move!
No, no, no, no, no.
Fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck is your problem?
What the fuck were you gonna do?
It's a fucking army.
We can still find out
where they are.
They're gonna know
where they are.
Then what? Oh, god.
- They're gonna know.
- The fuck?
- Hey!
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Don't fucking move.
- You speak English?
- Yes. Yes.
- Little. Little.
- Empty your pockets.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Hands over your head.
Who's that?
Datu junmar.
He in charge.
"Datu" means "chief."
Where's he taking them?
Hey! Where's he taking them?
I tell you, datu kill me.
- Kill my family.
- Me or datu?
Dandulit village.
Where is he keeping them
in dandulit?
Come on. Come on!
Warehouse, on the river.
Then boat takes.
Boat takes 'em where?
I don't know.
Where? Fucking tell me where.
- Tell me. Come on!
- I don't know!
Whatever datu say, we do.
I gotta go after them.
And do what? We should wait.
You said you made contact.
I don't know
how much got through.
And I'm not waiting here
to find out.
They're my passengers.
They're my responsibility.
You don't have to come.
I'm not expecting you to.
And I'm the
captain of trailblazer 119.
Now, we've gone down.
We made a crash landing on...
Sir,
we've been getting crank calls
- all day about this.
- No. Hello?
I hear you. I'm here.
Now, I need you
to patch me through
to emergency ops immediately.
Listen, we've been
getting calls all day about this.
- Just shut up and listen.
- Calm down, sir.
After that call was cut off,
torrance phoned his daughter,
Daniela, in Maui.
She confirmed the details
of the recording.
And she said he told her
they went down
somewhere in
the jolo island cluster.
I need key hole satellite access
to this area to find that plane.
Our assets are going airborne,
and we'll circle
the jolo cluster
until we get them
a drop location.
But I need you
to call in some favors
- and make it happen.
- Got it.
Good job, dele.
Passen...
Dandulit village
is one road in, one road out.
Is this any use to me?
You speak tagalog?
Yeah, she's plugging it in now.
Wait, I got... I think...
- We got it. We got it.
- We're there.
Found it. Dave, found the plane.
Jolo island. Torrance was right.
Stand by.
And there it is.
Can't believe
it's intact.
Sending the coordinates
to our assets now.
They'll drop on-site asap.
Well, there's really no need.
They'll contact
the philippine government.
Surely, they'll send
local authorities
- with a search and rescue.
- It won't be that easy, Terry.
- Why?
- Because there is
no authority on jolo island.
It's run by separatists
and militias.
The Filipino army
won't even go there anymore.
They got their asses kicked
so many times.
Look, the guys
will parachute in.
But they're gonna need some help
getting everyone out.
The village is two kilometers
in that direction.
You know you can't
just ask for them back.
Yeah, well,
you're the military man.
I was hoping
you'd have some ideas.
Ah, man.
Thank you... For helping.
A priest in the legion
used to say,
"redemption can only be found
in the most unusual places."
Well, this certainly qualifies.
Ing
Wait. Hey, hey. Hey, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?
Yeah, hey, stop!
Come. Come on.
Come here. Come on.
- Come, come, come.
- No. No!
Name. Country.
Oh!
Name! Country!
Maxwell carver, england.
Name. Country.
Brie Taylor, American.
Name. Country.
Oh!
Name! Country!
Matt sinclair, American!
Name. Country.
Katie dhar, Sweden.
Name. Country.
Samuel dele, Hong Kong.
Shellback. Two dead jundies.
Roger that. Set security.
Go police up the chutes.
Get them out the open.
Trailblazer cp,
this is shellback 6.
How copy?
We got you on comms, shellback.
Getting your visual up now.
Let's check
the plane. Check. On you.
Yeah, Terry here.
What do you mean, "no?"
We've got two bodies
in the rear galley.
Give us a look.
Shit.
Looks like it might be
crew members.
Did you properly convey
the urgency of the situation?
- Zip 'em up. We got 'em.
- That's unacceptable.
That is unacceptable.
You tell 'em I said that.
Filipinos won't send
a rescue team
without a battalion
of troops in support.
They're saying 24 hours.
True to form.
Any sign of the passengers
or the rest of the crew?
That's a negative, boss.
At least from
what I see right now.
Shit.
Trailblazer cp,
you're seeing this, right?
Looks like we may have a
hostage situation on our hands.
You see the boats?
They're fueling them up.
Shit.
Taking them off the island.
Once they're gone, that's it.
We have to do this quietly.
No guns until
we absolutely have to.
That's it? That's your plan?
You got a better one?
Oh, shit.
That's him. That's junmar.
That's the bus.
They gotta be in that house.
This way.
Oh, shit.
Go.
Psst.
Hey, everybody okay?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- What's happening?
- All right. Okay.
We're gonna get everybody
freed up and ready to move.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Hey, I'm gonna
have a look around.
Okay.
Now, we're gonna load back up
on that bus.
- Where are we going?
- Back to the plane.
What?
It's all right. I've made
contact with trailblazer.
I'm not sure what got through,
but they know we're alive.
So, they find that plane,
and they find us. All right?
- Everybody ready to move?
- Yes.
All right. Shh. Quiet. Fast.
Okay. Quick, quick, quick.
Quick. Hurry.
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go, go.
Can you drive this thing?
Yeah. I can drive anything.
Okay. Here are the keys.
I think it's the big one.
- Stop.
- What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's a bunch
of armed fuckers on the road.
We're gonna get mowed down
if we try to drive past them.
I can engage 'em, but it's
just gonna draw more of 'em.
Shit.
Okay, I can handle these guys.
How are you gonna do that?
I'm gonna distract them.
I'm gonna give myself up.
- That's your plan?
- Oh, you have a better one?
Look, we don't have
any other choice.
You're never gonna see
your goddamn family again.
What about their families?
Look, you know
I have to try, right?
I mean, I'm the captain.
These assholes are never gonna
kill me. Worth too much to them.
Yeah.
Wait here. Take this.
Hello? Anyone?
I need to speak to junmar.
And I'm unarmed!
No, I'm the captain.
I'm the pilot here.
You're a pilot?
Captain torrance?
I need to speak to junmar.
Datu junmar.
Other pilot say you leave
passengers to call for help.
How that go for you?
I came to talk to you
about that.
I contacted Manila.
They send, uh,
search and rescue for us,
lots of soldiers.
So, I'll be having
my passengers back, thank you.
You think you come here,
speak to me,
tell me do what you say.
You think backwards.
You in jolo now, pilot torrance.
No rescue coming.
Look, we had problems
in the air.
I had to land the plane.
My people just want to go home.
- You can understand.
- They're my people now.
You're mine.
No matter why.
Everything in jolo belong to me.
Until I don't want.
No one care when small man die.
But I make example of big man?
I kill him?
Now they care. Now they pay.
Fuck you.
Hajan.
They're friendlies, captain. Stay
where you are. Stay where you are.
You hurt?
Captain torrance, are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.
We got the package intact.
Eastern row, main house.
How copy? Shellback, out.
- Lake, you got the package.
- No, wait. Take the others.
Hey, we got them. Let's move!
Move!
Move! Move in!
Got you. Move.
- Everybody okay?
- Everybody, get down!
Roll out! Roll out now!
Hajan!
Hajan.
Took a hell of a beating,
captain. How are you feeling?
Okay. Okay, thanks.
Who are you guys?
We're trailblazer's
forward advance crew on this.
John Isaac.
Mo, Willis, and lake.
So, hold on.
You're the advance crew.
When is the rescue team
getting here?
Twenty-four hours
is the best trailblazer can do,
so, unfortunately,
we just became the rescue team.
Twenty-four hours.
We won't be left by then.
I understand, and that's why
we need to work up a contingency.
Now, we did bring
an emergency fund,
but not enough to buy our way
off this island. So...
What do you suggest
we do, captain?
Fuck.
I got a plan.
No, that's not the assumption.
We have very little information
at present.
However, we are coordinating
with all the search and
rescue efforts in the region.
Hopefully...
Dad.
I don't know
if you'll get this, but...
I love you so much.
You are the most amazing father.
And I'm sorry
if I don't say it enough.
I don't know what's happening.
Or if you're hurt.
I'm so scared.
So, just please come home.
Trailblazer cp,
this is shellback 6.
Let's wait a sec.
Copy, 6. What's your status?
Hostages secure,
but we've got another plan.
You're not gonna like it.
Come on. Everybody, hurry.
Run, run, run!
Hey, gather them here.
- Everyone, come on.
- Gather around.
Come on!
Now, there is
no full rescue team
coming anytime soon,
not for the next 24 hours.
- What?
- We can't wait.
They are gonna come at us
with everything they've got,
and we're not gonna survive.
Now, dele and I managed to get
the power back up on the plane.
From the west end.
We only have one chance.
And that is me flying us
out of here in this thing.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?
- No way in hell.
- I know.
- Listen, listen.
Listen, listen, listen!
If I didn't believe
it could be done,
I would not put you guys
back on that plane.
I have a daughter.
I have every intention
of hugging her again
and making it home.
And I'm telling you that the
way home is on this plane.
I've got you this far.
I just need you to trust me
this one more bit. Okay?
- All right, preflight checks.
- Copy that.
- Everybody, follow Mr. Dele.
- Follow me, come on.
- Okay. All right.
- Come on!
Come on!
Shellback, how long have I got?
Two minutes tops.
Can't be certain
the damage already done
won't affect
flight characteristics
or that the engines won't fail.
Shellback said
it can be done.
He's the man on the ground.
Short of proper inspection,
he's not qualified
to make that determination.
They're being hunted, Terry.
And you're talking
about inspections?
After all they've been through,
imagine the fallout
if I allow torrance
to fly that plane
and incinerate everybody in it.
Imagine the fallout
if you don't.
Make sure they get on okay.
Come on.
Run, run, run!
Everybody on.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go, Maria.
Ah, fuck.
We're about to have a lot
of bad guys up our asses.
I'm gonna need you
to pick up the pace, cap.
- All right.
- We've got two convoys
here and here,
and it looks like a third
is not far behind.
All right. I gotta
fix this brake first.
- You gotta buy me some time.
- Got it.
Like she said,
let's go. Let's go.
- Move!
- Bonnie!
I got it, captain! Help!
Keep moving.
Move! I can't get him.
Move, move, move!
Time to go, captain!
Time to go now!
Reloading!
Moving!
Shellback! Shellback,
I need comms.
It's already
on the team channel.
Once I start the engines,
you have two minutes.
- I'll leave the stairs down.
- Roger that.
You know I can't get
on that plane with you.
- Right?
- Yeah, okay. Good luck.
You too, my capitan.
Find a way
to strap him in, Bonnie.
Everybody, stay down, okay?
Just hang with me
just a little bit longer.
The cabin doors won't seal
without a reset.
Keep them open, all of them,
okay? So they're balanced.
Avionics still shot.
Nothing on screens.
Checked the hydraulics.
They look good.
Okay. Apu working?
- Apu working.
- Engaged?
- Engaged.
- Okay.
All right, dele.
Start 'em up.
Starting engines.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Get down!
Shit. I'm out of ammo.
Check our pallet.
Lake, reloading!
Reloading!
Shit.
I need you
with me, dele.
Keep your focus in here.
Hey, into the live.
Let's turn this baby around.
They hit our fuel tanks,
we're toast.
This is captain torrance.
Is anyone there?
Is anyone there, god damn it?
I'm about to take off.
Captain, you listen to me. That
plane stays right where she is.
- Am I understood?
- Captain torrance,
my name is David scarsdale.
Tell me what you need.
I need directional assistance.
We have no radar, no nav.
We are fully manual.
I figure we've got
about 300 miles tops.
Find me a place to land.
Shellback.
I need you and your men
on the plane now.
I'm gonna go as soon
as we make this turn.
- Get to the plane!
- Check.
Cover me!
Let's go!
Do we have enough road?
It's gonna have to be.
Gaspare, move! Move!
Gaspare, move!
Gaspare!
Come on!
Let's go!
My wing clear.
My wing is clear.
Can't wait
any longer, shellback.
What's your status?
Go on.
Take us up, captain.
Get down!
What the fuck?
Full throttle.
Cap, your shoulder.
I'm okay.
We're losing power,
right engine.
- Shutting it down.
- No!
We need all the thrust
we can get.
- We're gonna hit. We're gonna hit.
- Save left engine.
Come on.
Lost right engine.
Shut it down now.
Shutting down two.
How bad?
Right wing's trailing edge
is damaged.
Shit. Okay,
just keep an eye on it.
This is trailblazer 119.
We're airborne.
Trailblazer 119,
reading your air speed
at 135 knots.
Bordering stall rate.
This is as fast as she'll go.
Reading
your altitude at 400 feet.
You need to take her up to 3,000
or she's not staying up.
Negative on speed
and altitude.
119, you need
to take her up now.
We have no fucking doors.
We're depressurized,
we're low on fuel
and we just lost an engine. Now,
don't tell me what I already know.
Find me a place to land.
Pulling up lists
of available airfields now.
Let's get it up on the screen.
Best option, siasi island,
50 miles due south.
Adjust your heading to 15
degrees. There's a small airport there.
Can you make it?
We're gonna find out.
Jungle cleared. Feet wet.
Have a visual on siasi.
Come on. Come on, baby.
Just a little bit more.
Lost right-side control.
Losing altitude.
Have a visual on siasi runway.
Prepare for landing!
Brace for impact!
Brace for impact!
Full reverse on one.
Speed brakes.
Help me on the brakes, dele.
Oh.
Are we okay?
Yes.
Good job.
Congratulations, everyone.
Thank you.
You okay?
I've had better days.
One minute at a time, right?
One minute at a time.
You're a hell
of a pilot, captain.
- Mission accomplished?
- Absolutely.
You need to see someone?
Let's keep moving, everybody.
- You're the captain!
- Come on, man.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
Captain, you okay?
- Yeah, I am.
- Are you okay, captain?
Oh, yeah.
No, it looks worse than it is.
I think it was just a ricochet
or something.
Oh.
Hopefully, this is a better
layover than the last one.
All right, guys.
- It's been an honor.
- Yeah.
Good job, dele.
Just give me a moment.
Hey.
Are you gonna
go to the hospital?
I will.
Okay.
Hey.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Hey, it's me.
I'm coming home.
Yeah.
Yeah, you were right.
I'm gonna be a bit late.
