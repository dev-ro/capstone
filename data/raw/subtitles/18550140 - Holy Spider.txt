I'm going out. I'll be back
before you wake up. Okay?
Get lost already! Go!
I'll rip that pussy apart! Oh yes!
I'll destroy it!
What are you doing in there?
Come out already.
You're hard to find these days.
You need to pay me.
You know that, right?
I know.
First, I'll do a few more.
- Where's Soghra?
- She's in the Square.
I feel like shit.
I'm begging you.
I'll be in the square.
Keep your eyes open.
It's the police, stay down.
Wait.
Get down, lower.
Wait, I said!
Get your hands off me.
- Let go of me!
- Just wait.
Here.
- Is that all?
- You stopped.
- What the fuck?!
- Yeah, you didn't make me come.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- Clear off! Go!
Come here.
Show me the money first.
Cover yourself with this.
My downstairs neighbors
are a bit nosey.
It's dark, no one can see anything.
Just wear it already.
This way.
What are you waiting for?
Come already.
Come.
Be quiet. Don't make noise.
Come already.
Listen, to be honest,
I don't feel like it tonight,
I'll go now, okay?
Come.
- No, I have to go.
- Just come already!
I'll off. I don't want to do it.
I have a child.
HOLY SPIDER
I have no clue what it's about.
I just hear the name Spider Killer.
We don't dare leave our homes
after hearing stuff like this.
I don't understand all this violence.
Just look around you.
Not a cloud in the sky,
not a drop of rain.
Are you here on pilgrimage?
Yes.
Arezoo Rahimi...
- From Mashhad?
- Yes.
Meaning you live here?
No, sir.
Why would I come to the hotel?
- You want a room for yourself?
- Yes.
- And you're alone?
- Yes, it's just me.
Wait a moment.
She booked a room for herself.
But she's not married. She's alone.
What should I do?
Reject her reservation.
Sorry, ma'am, there's a problem
with our reservation system.
I'm sorry.
We can't take any reservations
because no rooms are vacant.
What do you mean?
I have a reservation.
Yes, I know you have a reservation,
but the thing is, I...
You've decided to give me the runaround.
I'm a journalist, here's my press pass.
Oh, you're a journalist?
Okay, wait a moment.
Haji, it looks like she's a journalist.
- Is it okay now?
- Yeah, that's fine.
Okay. Welcome, ma'am.
- What happened? Problem solved?
- Yes, it's fixed now.
Out of nowhere?
Please cover your hair, ma'am.
That's not your business.
- We can get into trouble...
- Just do your job and get my room.
You're not the one they'll shut down.
I'm in no mood to fight you.
People are afraid, they're on edge.
He's been wanted for 6 or 7 months.
Look, this guy is no Einstein.
There must be clues,
evidence, something.
- Well, he's no ordinary killer.
- How do you know?
- He phones me.
- Who does?
The killer.
Are you kidding me?
No.
He usually phones after every murder.
He calls you? Why you?
I don't know. He knows
I'm on the crime desk.
He wants to be sure he's in the news.
What did he say last time?
He told me where the body was.
He was angry.
He doesn't want to be called a killer.
He wants us to write he's doing
"jihad on decadence."
How's his tone? Does he sound exalted?
Depends on how he's feeling.
Sometimes he's upbeat,
he acts like he's your friend.
You'd almost forget why he's calling.
And some days, he's angry.
Why have you never mentioned this?
You shouldn't mention it, either.
- Please don't publish that.
- Why not?
This is no ordinary murder case.
- We must avoid religious subjects.
- Who told you that?
- The order comes from above.
- Why, though?
This is Mashhad.
Some things are done differently here.
Sharifi, you were braver before.
I don't want you getting into trouble.
I won't get into trouble.
I'm doing my job.
I suppose you never recorded him?
Or did you?
Write down what I will tell you.
- Are you writing it down?
- Yes, I am.
Old Quchan Road,
near Shahid Fahmideh Square.
Get the body before it starts to stink.
- Where are you?
- None of your business, son of a whore!
I'll strike down these whores one by one.
I won't rest.
The cement is ready, boss.
Mr. Saeed?
The cement is ready.
It's ready?
9 BODIES
WHO IS THE SPIDER KILLER?
Is it your stomach again?
- Yeah.
- You're too nervous and angry.
Saeed... Here.
Where's Ali?
He's at the mosque, praying.
Saeed, my dad called.
He invited us for dinner Thursday,
but I thought you might be busy.
My parents complain
they hardly see you, Saeed.
They say you're never around,
and they're right.
- This time we're going, we'll fix it.
- We'll go?
Okay, good, then.
Dad, weren't we supposed to play?
Khadijeh, here.
- I'm tired, kiddo.
- But you promised!
- We'll play later, okay?
- Why not play with her now?
Come into my arms.
Here.
What a lovely girl.
Pilgrims visit Mashhad for their
beloved Imam Reza then
return to former homes
once they're emotionally satisfied.
Peace be upon you, Imam Reza.
Why do you think the murders
spiked in the past 2 months?
Might be just a coincidence.
Unconnected incidents.
Don't clues all point
to the Spider Killer?
- You seem well informed.
- So what's your opinion?
Is this an individual act?
Or an organized group?
We believe it to be a clever
and well-prepared individual.
But no theory should be ruled out.
- For example?
- Listen, Miss Rahimi...
Criminals, however clever,
will make mistakes.
It's the golden rule of criminology.
One slip up and we'll catch him.
If there's no slip up?
We need to be patient.
I don't want to criticize...
But how can it be with all
the murders piling up
you haven't found any clues?
Where do you think you are?
This is a police station and
I'm in charge of this case.
Your coverage was biased
from the start.
You make us seem incompetent.
Think this is easy?
Let's trade places, if you wish.
Take my place.
Take my stripes, even.
- Tehran is pressuring me.
- I know.
Everyone has their own opinion:
The governor, deputies, police chief.
Think it's easy? Really?
Here.
Marlboro Red.
- You're a smoker?
- Occasionally.
Any occasion is good.
Could I take a look at your files?
And there it is.
I relax, you seek an advantage.
Not at all. I wouldn't print details
without your approval.
We can meet again to discuss this.
"The procrastination of authorities
and inability to adopt any
effective strategy raises questions."
So noted.
"Meanwhile, no sign of the end
of these murders in Mashhad."
Wrote that down, too.
It's a bit dry, isn't it?
- The ending isn't very good.
- That's true.
- Add some gravitas.
- How about this:
"Meanwhile, the Spider..."
Yeah.
"The shadow of the Spider Killer
still looms over Mashhad."
"...still looms over Mashhad."
That works better.
- It is better.
- It's perfect.
Come on, dad, full throttle!
Faster.
Hang on now.
Awesome.
Did you like that?
Don't tell your mother.
I almost fell.
The Khin-e Arab Road,
between kilometers 10 and 15.
Alright.
- Stop writing those lies.
- Which ones?
- I'm cleaning the streets for Imam Reza.
- That's enough.
It's not over.
What's your name?
How long will you do this?
As long as it takes. Look...
I'm defending the blood of our martyrs.
- People like you...
- Shut up!
Did they find common threads
in these murders?
Yes, he has a signature.
He strangles them with their scarves.
Ties the scarf twice around.
- For all 10?
- Yes, according to the coroner.
At least you have access to him.
He won't even take my calls.
He's a friend.
DNA tests, fingerprints,
do your friends know about these?
The lab in Tehran did some testing,
but it's all new to them.
You also still need a suspect.
Without a suspect, what do you compare?
Someone kills 10 women,
all the same way,
dumps them in the same
part of town and we can't find him?
He's one of theirs. He's protected.
How would my personal
opinion help you?
I ask because our city is divided.
Some say murder,
some say something else.
They're not murders?
This person is following a fatwa.
Rest assured this is not our opinion.
I should make this clear.
I know why you are here.
I know why you're wearing that chador...
Miss Rahimi.
No need to pretend.
I know you don't like us clerics.
You think we're plotting
behind the scenes.
You think, wrongly,
the regime is corrupt.
In the eyes of God, all life is sacred.
So these women don't deserve to die?
Why would I say that?
It's a social problem.
You don't sell your body,
if you're not poor and destitute.
Caring for citizens is the
foundation of good government.
There is no fatwa, but in any case,
a fatwa is religious opinion,
not an order.
Thanks for the clarification, your honor.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry, Haji Agha, might we
have access to the case files?
The police agrees the case
needs some sort of coverage.
Why are you so interested
in this case, Miss Rahimi?
This is my job, your honor.
Your job is to inform,
not to instill fear,
or to disturb public opinion.
I must say, we're not
instilling fear.
The fear is already in society.
Miss Rahimi, I won't allow you to
make this case something it isn't.
It's your method.
Mind your behavior.
Especially in this holy city of Mashhad.
Thank you, your honor.
May God protect you.
I need to talk to these girls myself.
One of them must have seen him.
But they won't talk easily.
Plus, you can't blindly trust them.
They're spaced-out drug addicts.
90% of what they say is a lie.
If the police were a little smarter,
they'd pay one to act as bait.
Police and prostitutes cooperating!
That's a good one, Miss Rahimi.
What happened in Tehran, anyway?
There were rumors
about you and the editor-in-chief.
You were fooling around together.
Fooling around?
For every one of my articles,
he kept me after work hours.
He invited me home, into his bedroom.
I filed a complaint, they fired me.
You call that fooling around?
I'm the victim and you're shaming me.
Miss Rahimi, I didn't mean to offend.
Sharifi, you said what you shouldn't.
Come on, you know me.
It's too crowded today.
I'm going back to the hotel.
- I'll escort you.
- No need, I can go alone.
Please, you know I didn't
mean anything by that.
- God is great.
- Weren't we supposed to play?
- Not when it's time for prayer, though.
- Let's play.
Look at this girl...
Interrupting my prayers now?
Don't move, or you'll fall.
Move and I'll tickle you.
I'm gonna tickle you.
This guy killed how many women?
The newspaper says 10.
Police are on his trail.
They'll catch him, God willing.
I forbade my daughters
to stay out at night.
They say he only goes after prostitutes.
How can we know? Nobody is safe.
Some say it's an organized
group of professionals.
Listen, Ali.
Your father ran around
in a rain of bullets,
same as if there wasn't a war
and we weren't at the front.
Running around under fire?
I'm not that crazy, Haji.
You're thinking of someone else.
- I didn't mean to intrude.
- You're always welcome.
- You're well, God willing?
- God be praised.
Khadijeh, bring the sugar bowl, dear.
Saeed, you don't often visit
at the veterans' center.
I'll bring him next time, Haji.
Here you are.
I know you better than my own children.
Something's not right with you.
You've lost weight, you're too nervous.
Is there another woman in the picture?
- Stop here. Stop, Haji.
- Huh? What is it?
- I said stop.
- It's okay, calm down, we're just talking.
You call this talking?
Why are you saying this, Haji?
I told Fatima you're not that type.
"He can barely handle one."
What's the problem, then?
You can talk to me...
You know?
What's bothering you?
Nothing, Haji.
Work, the usual worries...
I feel lost.
I want to do something...
God didn't create me only just
to do brick work in construction.
Haji... I wish the war had never ended.
Some became martyrs,
disappeared, mutilated...
Some returned home to
their families in coffins.
But I didn't become anything.
Why?
Wasn't I deserving?
Why didn't I deserve it?
We can't all be martyred.
God decides, not us.
We must live our lives,
take care of our families.
None of this is their fault.
How about this?
Drop me off and take my car.
Take your family on a trip. Okay?
Sir, may I use your bathroom?
It's for customers.
Please.
Bring a bottle of orange Fanta too.
Ma'am, are you okay?
Would you like a sandwich also?
It's alright if you want one.
What's your name?
Soghra.
Aren't you afraid hanging
around here at this hour?
Afraid of what?
This killer who murders women.
Haven't you or your friends
seen him around?
Haven't you seen anyone
who's even remotely suspicious?
Everyone's suspicious here.
Do you use?
Addicted to drugs or something?
Do you walk near
this hotel every night?
- Thank you.
- Soghra...
Get lost!
Get lost!
I said get lost!
Yeah, come on.
Come on, try to score.
Can't get past me?
Don't try to score on dad.
Throw it. Come on.
Go on, kiddo.
Go ahead.
We need to do this more often.
- We will.
- It does the children good.
I want nothing but peace for you.
- I know that.
- You do?
Why are you laughing then?
Because you say so, but you...
I'm sorry, Dad.
Come here, kiddo. Come here.
- I'm sorry, Dad...
- Come here!
- Dad?
- Saeed?
Come here, where are you going?
Come here!
- Dad...
- Saeed!
- Stop. I said stop.
- Dad!
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing? Sit.
Ali, look what you've done.
What happened, Saeed?
What's wrong, Saeed? Look at me.
What's happening to you?
What's going on?
I'm sorry, Dad.
Stand up, it's embarrassing in public.
Come on, get up,
we're going to your sisters'.
You're always working,
and for once we have fun,
you start acting like this.
It's nothing, kiddo.
- Ah, damn it!
- What?
I forgot to bring the tools to Gholam.
- So what?
- He starts really early tomorrow.
So?  Must you go now?
Yes, I'll rest easier, Fatima.
- Can't you go later?
- No.
Apologize to your parents.
I'll come tomorrow after lunch.
- After lunch?
- Yes. Alright?
Get out, kids.
Fatima...
- Dear Fatima, look at me...
- Come on, get out.
Why are you so upset?
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Why are you so timid?
May I have an apple?
Of course.
Take one.
Make yourself at home.
You feel alright?
Not sick or anything?
It's so hot in here.
I'll open a window.
Glory be to God.
Fatima? Fatima?
- Can you take out the trash?
- Alright.
Back so soon?
I forgot the pickles for mom.
They really wanted some.
- Where are the kids?
- They stayed there.
What happened here?
A leak. I have to tell
Mr. Ahmad to come and fix it.
- Again?  He fixed it the other day.
- I don't know...
Don't roll up a carpet, it damages it.
I'll fix it, my dear.
Can you warm something up?
- You haven't eaten?
- No, I'm starving.
You understood me,
and as always, helped me
make my dreams come true.
I know all about your dreams.
Did you notice anything?
Notice what?
Look here.
I changed my hairstyle.
See the curls here?
I went today with mom.
Was it expensive?
- It's beautiful.
- You say so, but didn't notice.
My darling...
- Saeed?
- Yes?
Marzieh says one evening when
I took the kids to my parents'...
She saw you come into
the house with a woman.
Mrs. Marzieh is confused.
How can she be mistaken?
Seeing you 30 feet away, Saeed?
Dear Fatima, you know me.
There's no other woman.
Saeed?
Are you tired of me?
Tired of you?
- Mr. Sharifi...
- Hello.
- I see you brought your guest.
- Yes.
You can't say we're hindering access.
Miss Rahimi, go and see.
There's nothing to see here!
You're stepping on the tomatoes.
Officer, let her through.
Stay back from the body.
Keep away.
This is a crime scene.  Move back.
Don't come any closer, ma'am.
Miss Rahimi?
Try to breathe.
Step back from the body.
Keep your distance already!
Why did that bastard
dump her on my farm?
Who'll want to buy our tomatoes?
Make way. Go stand there.
Move along folks, don't stand here.
Make way.
Officer Mohammadi,
Bring Miss Rahimi some sweet tea.
Try to breathe.
Thank you.
Miss Rahimi, drop this case.
It's a bottomless pit.
Think of your own health and safety.
Good night.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I came to check on you.
Feeling better?
I'm fine, thanks.
I need to talk to you. May I come in?
Are you comfortable here?
- It's okay.
- For a short stay, sure.
Have a seat.
Thank you, I'm fine like this.
Will you smoke with me?
Thank you for letting me
see the crime scene today.
I told Sharifi it wasn't for women.
I was upset, I'd seen her before.
They're all the same.
Prostitutes addicted to drugs.
This one was even pregnant.
She had a baby bump.
It's disgusting...
Knocked up and still sleeping around.
Forget it, I'm not here for work.
Excuse me but I'm tired.
If you're finished...
Don't be fooled by my uniform.
I seem tough, but I'm sensitive.
I want to show you around Mashhad,
take you out to dinner.
I told you I was tired.
I'm asking you to leave now.
I said go.
What if I don't want to?
What will you do?
Call police?
You were fired from your
newspaper for this teasing?
You're not worth it.
You're one of those women
who smokes with any man.
You're one of those.
Yes.
- Dad, look what I found.
- What?
Let me see.
This is trash.
Why out the window, Dad?
Why not the trash can?
You're right, I should have.
But it was fun to throw it.
I did like a child would.
Mom, look what Dad did.
He threw the apple out the window.
Why did you throw
the apple out the window?
Fine things to teach children...
Come, kiddo.
- The taxi's coming, are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
I wanna throw an apple
out the window too...
No.
Daddy was wrong to throw
that apple out the window.
You shouldn't follow
in his footsteps, okay?
Good girl. Let's go.
Grandma and Grandpa are waiting.
It must be near here.
Are you sure about this?
This is not a good neighborhood.
I'll call you.
Young man...
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello.
- Do you know Mrs. Zari?
- Yeah, she lives there.
Hello.
- Are you Mrs. Zari?
- What do you want?
I wanted to talk a few minutes
about Soghra.
- Who's Soghra?
- Your daughter.
I don't know any Soghra.
Go away.
Why are you snooping here?
What do you want from me?
I don't know a Soghra. Leave! Go!
Who's Soghra?
Which Soghra do you mean?
Which Soghra do you want
to talk about? Which?
He's the same one
who took Somayeh.
I'm sure it was him.
Mr. Rasul saw him take her
on his motorcycle.
Who's Mr. Rasul?
A city worker.
He works in the square.
- He saw his face?
- From afar.
I'm not sure about Soghra.
I told her to avoid motorcyclists.
She used to listen to me.
Where was Soghra standing that night?
The usual, close to Laleh Square.
Did you tell this to police?
Look at my face, princess.
I smoke 6 grams of opium a day.
- Think I can talk to cops?
- I could come with you.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
He's cleaning up their streets.
Why would they arrest him?
I saw him, like, 4-5 times.
He rode around on a motorbike.
Studying everything around him.
Where did he pick up Somayeh?
There. Across the street.
Did Soghra go with him too?
Are you with police?
No, I already told you,
I'm a journalist.
I've had trouble with police before.
I want to stay quiet now.
It seems he comes Thursday evenings.
Looks like a fundamentalist.
It all adds up.
Okay, just be careful.
Are you there now?
Yeah. Khin-e Arab Road.
It's close to the highway.
Would be easy to dump bodies there.
He might even live around here.
I don't think so.
Let me call Rostami...
No, I don't trust police.
Why? We need to tell them.
- I said I don't trust them.
- Why not?
I barely even trust you.
Thanks a lot.
Your plan is still reckless.
Okay, I'm stupid and this is stupid.
Will you help or not?
Why are you saying this?
You've become such a coward.
Want to go for a ride?
A ride? On your donkey?
Get lost.
I've seen you before. It's a sign.
A sign for you to
go home and jerk off.
I have a nice house, good food,
opium, even.
Let's see your money.
Hold on tight.
How much longer will you take?
As long as my pussy takes.
Come out already.
It doesn't like being yelled at.
Cover yourself.
- Ohhh, I like you!
- Don't touch me!
You're not starting?
The meter is running.
Let's see if you can
take care of my pussy or not.
How about that opium?
Or was that bullshit?
Nah.
What?
Wait, I'll prepare it for you.
Wait, it's coming.
Is this how you like it?
I love that beard of yours...
Fucking whore!
- Don't touch me.
- What happened?
I have to use the bathroom.
Go then.
Your turn to sing in there now.
My God, help me.
Come on out!
Where are you?
Come into my arms, come on.
Motherfucker.
So?
Not laughing anymore?
Laugh.
Go ahead.
Laugh.
- Let's go.
- Shut up!
Get lost, asshole!
- Miss Rahimi.
- Stay back.
Let's leave. It's getting late.
We can't hang around that place...
Every night.
He won't come.
He'll come. I know he will.
Any articles about the Spider Killer?
No idea, sir. Maybe these papers?
- Help yourselves.
- Hello, dear Fatima.
How are you?
You made it just in time.
- Because my mother-in-law likes me.
- She sure does.
I do like you.
I even made your favorite dish.
Khadijeh, Zahra, come to dinner.
Zahra, dinner. It'll get cold.
There must be Shirazi salad
at every meal, or,
it's no real dinner to me.
Thank you.
What happened to your hand, Saeed?
Pickaxe accident at work.
I didn't even notice right away,
I didn't notice at first, either.
Does it hurt?
- What were you doing?
- Bringing down a wall.
My guys didn't pay attention.
But it's partly my fault.
We wonder where your head is lately.
It'll heal. Eat now, dinner will get cold.
May I serve?
What can I say, dear?
When you go somewhere,
you only call us
when you get there,
but that's not enough.
- Dear Arezoo...
- I'm sorry, Mom, I've been very busy.
My child, think about your father,
and his diabetes.
What difference would my call
make to Dad's diabetes?
That's right, laugh it off.
Some day, you'll have your own children
and you'll understand how this works.
Mom, did you get
your eyebrows done?
Arezoo, are you smoking?
Not so thick this time.
They looked like an airstrip last time.
Don't change the subject.
You have asthma.
Smoking isn't good for you.
Tell me, are you
still looking for that killer?
Yeah, I am.
Do you ever consider
how worried we get about you?
Don't be worried, Mom. It's not
my first time doing this. I'm careful.
Hmm... You always say that.
You whore!
Come, hop on.
Get lost.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
- You have any money?
- I do. Climb on.
Hold on tight.
Son of a bitch!
Where the hell is that scum?
This way.
One never knows who might
knock when it's not convenient.
Go sit. Make yourself at home.
- There?
- Anywhere you feel comfortable.
In the dark?
You're right.
Can't sit in the dark.
Here, there's light now.
Go sit and be comfortable.
Tea or fruits?
Which one will you have?
Tea or fruits?
Where's the bathroom?
There to the right.
What's your name?
Zahra.
- Are you from Mashhad?
- Yeah.
- Where in Mashhad?
- None of your business.
You're lying, right?
You're not from Mashhad.
What's your job?
Do I ask you about your job?
I'm a mason.
Is this your first time?
You look amateur.
- What's happened to your hand?
- Nothing.
Accident at work.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, I'm just playing.
- What are you doing? Get off me!
- I'm playing.
Calm down. Calm down.
- I'm not alone here.
- I was just playing and joking around.
- Go open the door!
- Okay, calm down.
- I said go open the door! Go!
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on!
- Okay.
- Faster!
- Okay. Okay.
Calm down. Calm down...
- Step aside. Step aside!
- Okay, here.
- Help!
- You fucking whore...
You piece of trash!
Pull a knife on me, huh?!
- Huh?
- Get off me...
- Pull a knife on me, you fucking slut?
- Help!
Wait, where are you going?
If you come close, I'll stab you.
Don't scream.
- Help!
- Don't scream!
- Help, people!
- Don't scream!
- Stay back, I said.
- I beg you, don't scream.
Don't scream. I have a family.
I beg you, don't scream.
- Go to the bathroom and lock yourself in.
- Okay, okay. Please just don't scream.
- Stay back.
- Don't scream. Okay, okay. I will.
- Go to the bathroom and lock yourself in!
- Okay, okay. I will.
Okay, okay.
Come on, or I'll scream louder!
Don't scream!
Lock the door!
Help!
Mr. Saeed?
What's all this noise?
Answer the door, Saeed.
Yes?
I'm coming.
Who is it?
It's the police, they have questions.
Police? Why are they here?
Maybe Ali has done something.
I knew he'd get in trouble
at football... Wait, I'll come too.
No need, I'll be right back.
- Yes?
- Mr. Azimi?
- Yes, that's me.
- Saeed Azimi?
- Yes.
- Is this your house?
Yes, it is.
You need to come
with us to the police station.
What are you looking at?
I'm talking to you.
I know why you're here.
Okay, then come with us willingly.
Let me change out of my pajamas.
No need for that.
We're going right now.
Take it easy.
My neighbors are looking at us.
What's going on, Dad?
Nothing, go inside,
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Where are you taking him?
What's happened?
Saeed?
Saeed?!
Where are you taking him?!
Dad!
I thank our hardworking brothers
in the police department
who were able to arrest this criminal
after tireless hours of work, and show...
Look how grateful to you they are.
They can't stop mentioning you
and thanking you.
You're famous!
This isn't over yet.
I want to thank the press
for their presence.
There's no way they'll let him off.
His case file is too thick.
They'll try to find a way.
We make sure those who would
jeopardize the safety of the...
Holy City of Mashhad get punished...
You still believe in a conspiracy?
How was he?
He was fine.
He'll be back in a few days.
Who did he fight with?
He didn't fight, dear.
How can I explain?
Your dad sent some depraved
street women to hell.
Ali, dear, you don't need
to know about these things.
God will help us.
- So they'll release him?
- Of course they will. Why not, dear?
Your dad hasn't done anything wrong.
What were these women doing?
God, forgive me.
Ali, dear, those women were depraved,
morally corrupt and worthless.
They found young people
in the streets and sold them drugs.
They got what they deserved.
Your father isn't at fault here.
Ma'am, tell Mr. Abbas hello for me.
Thank you for shopping here.
- How much is this?
- Nothing, Ali. It's on me.
Thank you, then.
Why the sad face, young man?
Is your father well?
Thanks for asking.
Yeah, he's fine. Still in prison.
You shouldn't be embarrassed, Ali.
Tell your mom I said hello.
She can come by anytime
and take whatever you guys need.
Thanks.
Some fruit...
It's nothing I could charge you for.
We owe your father much more.
Take it, go tell your mom I said hello.
She can come anytime and
have whatever you guys need.
- Thank you.
- Don't forget what I said.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I felt responsible for cleaning up the city
and ridding it of sin and decadence.
How did you know the victims
were morally corrupt?
It was obvious, Your Honor.
How did you know for sure?
Well, you don't need to be a genius
to identify whores in the streets.
Choose your words, Mr. Azimi.
The court is considered holy. Never
use obscene words like that here again.
Obscene is how those women
stand in front of Imam Reza's holy shrine
and offer their bodies with impunity.
So you confirm that you
committed murder in all 17 counts?
16, Your Honor.
So who killed the 17th victim?
A coward.
If he wasn't a coward,
he'd come out and admit to it.
Silence!
Silence!
Where were you when
your wife was killed?
In prison, Your Honor.
What was your crime?
Distribution of drugs.
Some people came here to us
and tried to convince us to forgive him.
They tried everything.
They even offered us money.
But you're not forgiving him?
We won't forgive a killer.
Why didn't you come to the trial?
We wanted to come, but...
We don't want to drag this out.
Understand?
But you're her parents.
You could file a civil suit.
For what? For what?
You want us to stand in court,
in front of everyone while they
call our daughter corrupt?
A drug addict?
Sorry, ma'am.
We know it's a bad time.
To be honest...
I'm glad she died.
I'm rid of all the trouble she'd bring.
The path she chose
could not lead to a better end.
I'm glad she died.
Stop it, woman. This isn't right.
Don't say such things when
the kid's around. She'll hear.
So what? Am I wrong?
I'm not wrong. No, not wrong.
Sorry about that.
She can't control her emotions.
She's always crying.
Given a choice, would you...
Prefer retaliation in kind,
or financial compensation?
She won't come back to life
from executing her killer.
No. After that, it's just me
who can no longer work,
and that poor girl who'll need
to work hard just to eat.
I'm only worried about her kid,
I don't want her to end up like mom.
She was the apple of my eye.
I raised her as best I could.
Did you hear that?
That's what I was talking about.
They're trying to buy his forgiveness.
These folks are all poor and helpless.
They'd sign any sort of document
for some money in return.
You still think I'm paranoid?
Where do you think
this money comes from?
What will happen now, Sir?
Look, Mrs. Azimi,
this case has turned
into sort of a political matter.
The government is pressuring everyone
to close this case before the election.
They're moving forward very quickly.
But it can't go on like this.
Saeed has support in the community.
He has friends out there. People
love and support him in the streets.
Exactly. My father has much support.
Yes, and that's why an
insanity plea is on the table.
- And it's his only chance.
- What does insanity plea mean?
It means we'll prove Saeed was sick
when he was committing the crimes.
My father isn't crazy, Sir.
Shut your mouth.
Either stay quiet or get out.
Haji, it's very kind of you,
but this is too much.
It's nothing, Mrs. Fatima.
Members of the association have
gathered these to help you out a bit.
May God reward them.
God willing...
Everything will be fine.
How are you doing these days?
I don't know what to say, Haji.
I never imagined Saeed
would do something like this.
Why would he try to be a hero?
Don't worry about it.
We started a petition to support him.
Ali, wait. Wait, I'm coming, too.
People don't want him found guilty.
But, Haji, this judge...
Doesn't seem to care about these things.
A judge can't rule against people's will.
You're right, but they say
Saeed's case is different.
It's become political, Haji.
Don't worry about such things.
That's why we're here.
His friends are by his side.
I don't know, Haji...
Just take care of your children.
Ali... Look after the family.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Look after your mother and sisters.
- I will.
Between the years 1981 and 1988,
he was active 623 days
on the front lines of the war.
There's no doubt the war caused
serious mental issues for him.
The defendant has had a history
of mental illness for quite some time.
The question is whether the
defendant himself believes this.
His medical history leaves no doubt.
The court will consider this.
- Thank you.
- I told you they'd find a way.
The defendant may take the stand,
to explain his mental illness now, if any.
In the name of the martyrs.
Your Honor, if the documents say I'm crazy,
then there's nothing left to say.
Yes...
I'm crazy.
Crazy about the 8th Imam.
- Mr. Azimi... Mr. Azimi...
- Imam Reza.
Crazy about getting rid of decadence.
Mr. Azimi, the court is not a place
for your personal opinion and values.
Am I crazy, in your opinion?
Saeed...
Do you think I'm crazy?
Either answer the questions,
or I'll order your removal.
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- If doing your duty means you're crazy...
- Go ahead. Remove him from the court.
- Then, yes, I'm crazy, Your Honor.
- Get out.
- I'm crazy about Imam Reza.
I'm crazy about ridding
the world of decadence.
- Get out. Escort him out.
- What's wrong with this kind of craziness?
Yes, I am crazy.
Crazy about God.
I'm crazy about God.
Mr. Saeed, God be with you.
I'm at your service.
I thought we had agreed.
We talked a lot about it.
Your lawyer talked to you about it.
Then you take the stand in court
and say something else?
Don't say these things, Fatima.
I'm not crazy. Am I?
Huh? Do you think I'm crazy?
Plus, I don't want my supporters
to think they support a crazy person.
Who supports you?
People in the streets,
everyone here in prison, they all...
Stop it!
Stop, I can't listen to another word.
Listen to me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'll be out very soon. Okay?
You've often said that, Saeed.
I said I'll be out very soon.
Now, go be with the kids.
Send Ali in here, I want to talk to him.
What's with you?
Why are you nervous?
Why are you picking your nose?
Who taught you things like that?
Why are you smiling?
- You did.
- I did? Okay.
How is school going?
- I'm not going to school.
- You're not?
Why?
I got in a fight.
Why?
The boy I fought with
said you're a murderer.
Everyone has their opinion and
there's nothing wrong with that.
Most people like you, I do know that.
I didn't do anything, kiddo.
And if I did, it was for God.
I have a clear conscience.
What did you do to those women?
It's not for children, dear boy.
You just said I've become a man!
And you believed me?
Tell me what you did to them.
I'd pick them up in the streets,
bring them home,
make them drop to the floor,
then strangle them with my hands.
Wouldn't they try to escape?
Of course they would.
For sure.
You're not underestimating
your father, are you?
Thank you very much
for your time, Mrs. Azimi.
We know this situation
hasn't been kind to you, either.
That's alright. Please go on.
How did you feel when told
the Spider Killer is your husband?
I felt very bad. Terrible.
I was shocked.
I didn't think Saeed would be
the kind to do things like that.
Did you notice anything different
about his behavior?
- In the past year?
- No, nothing.
He was the same person.
He wasn't different at all.
He'd leave for work,
then come home to his
family at the end of the day.
He never acted so I'd become
suspicious that something
happened with him.
I think that, if these women had morals,
they wouldn't be on streets
hunting other women's husbands...
I was one of those women.
He also took me to your house.
But you had no right to act as bait,
and entice my husband to
come after you to do his moral duty.
What about your husband?
Who hired him to clean up the city?
My husband was at the front.
He has martyrs in his family.
When he sees all these women
going around wearing a short jacket,
in make-up, chewing gum
in this holy city...
Sorry for this rant, but...
- That's beside the point, Mrs. Azimi...
- It just isn't normal.
Mrs. Azimi, may we talk to Ali?
You may. Ali loves his father.
I'll tell him to come here. Ali.
According to the defendant's
crystal clear confession and explanation,
his reconstruction of the crime scenes,
and the statement from Miss
Arezoo Rahimi, a witness in this case,
and in accordance with
articles 286, 383, 621 and 618,
of the Islamic Penal Code,
I hereby request the maximum sentence
for the defendant, from this court.
Let the defendant take the stand
for his final statement.
In the name of God,
the Merciful, the Compassionate.
"To firmly establish the truth
and wipe out falsehood,
even to the dismay of the wicked."
I had them translate to Persian,
so everyone might understand.
Saeed Azimi is innocent!
Go away, please. No gatherings here.
Do you see the crowd?
I do. They'll be back to
their lives in a few days.
And it'll be just us and our problems.
Saeed Azimi must be released!
Sit there, Mr. Azimi.
Thank you, brother.
Well, well, Miss Rahimi...
You were perfectly seductive
that night in your make-up.
This is Mr. Sharifi,
from Khorasan Newspaper.
So you're Mr. Sharifi?
I know your voice well.
What a friendly gathering.
Mr. Azimi, have you ever felt remorse?
Why would I? I did my duty.
When I do feel guilty...
It's because I failed to finish my work.
So 16 weren't enough for you?
Almost 17.
I identified about 200 women
around the holy shrine...
To eliminate... In time.
Lately, if I didn't kill any,
I couldn't fall asleep at night.
Like the drug addicts.
So you never felt anything
when killing these women?
No.
You didn't feel pleasure when
you were about to kill me?
You didn't enjoy it each time?
What I enjoyed was cleaning the city.
Not personal pleasure.
You don't convince me.
I was there that night.
You were lucky to escape.
You should be rotting
on the Khin-e Arab Road.
Watch what you say.
Don't be afraid, Miss Rahimi.
We're only talking.
Tomorrow the verdict will be pronounced.
Tomorrow, you'll witness it too.
Witness divine intervention.
My work is not yet done.
Be certain of that.
You're very certain of yourself.
You hear the people right now.
They're on my side.
It's the people's will.
I still have much to do,
not just in Mashhad,
but the entire country.
The defendant will rise.
The 53rd Branch Mashhad Public Court
hereby finds the defendant, Saeed Azimi,
son of Mohammad...
Born on September 4th, 1955,
guilty of 16 counts of first-degree murder,
kidnapping, as well as
disturbing public opinion
and threatening public safety.
He's hereby sentenced
to 12 counts of retaliation in kind,
financial compensation
to families of 4 of the victims,
for 14 years in prison,
100 lashes for illicit relations,
confiscation of some belongings
due to theft, for 4 years in prison...
- After you.
- No, no, after you.
- Hello.
- Hello, Haji.
How are you?
- May God accept your prayer.
- I hope so.
I'm well, God willing.
How about you? You good?
- Haji, did they let you come in?
- Yes.
I've got friends here and there, too.
Nice. Thank God.
Mr. Haghani is one of those old friends
from the war days in Susangerd.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Saeed.
- It's all right.
- Sorry you had a rough time in court,
but I have to put on a show,
I have no choice.
He's got his own set of problems, too.
But it's all going to be fine.
Isn't it, Haji?
Of course. 100%.
But the judge looked very serious
about convicting and sentencing.
He had to look like that.
Tehran is pressuring him.
We're all being watched closely
by the press. But don't worry.
Let's plan the next step.
- Look, Saeed...
- What?
They bring you out for execution.
They take you through the backyard,
to a car, and you'll be gone.
Okay?
That'll be it.
Okay, but what must I do, Haji?
Nothing, just get some rest...
Say your prayers...
Don't worry about it.
We'll take care of everything.
Haji, I'm a bit confused.
You're right to be confused.
Don't worry about anything.
Just stay calm.
- I really like you, Haji.
- Same here.
Thank you very much, Haji.
May God protect you.
- I'm looking after your family too.
- That's kind of you, Haji.
- Don't worry about anything.
- May God reward you, Haji.
Don't mention anything to anyone
about our visit here.
Even to Fatima.
It has to stay secret.
- Of course. Yes.
- Do you understand?
It's not too late, dear.
Repent. Ask for forgiveness.
Mother, God is pleased with me
and I'm pleased He's pleased.
Why would I need forgiveness?
It's no time to say such things.
When will that be?
You want me to talk to my son's
corpse when he's hanging dead?
Don't cry, Mom.
Imam Reza is by my side.
Did you ever think
about your young wife?
Did you ever think about her?
About your innocent children?
You're making them more nervous
instead of calming them down.
Why, why did you do this to us?
You destroyed our lives, Saeed.
- Don't cry, honey.
- Ali!
Is this how you'll look after the family?
You'll be the man of the house like this?
Don't cry, dear.
- Keep your head up.
- Oh, darling...
Whatever God wants to happen will happen.
Believe in God.
Take him.
Has the sentence of 100 lashes
been carried out?
Apparently, there was a lapse
in carrying out that sentence.
Take him now.
Take it easy!
Not so hard!
Enough!
Take him to carry out
the execution sentence.
You should stay here for now.
We have to witness the
sentence being carried out.
There are already witnesses in there.
But we're here for that purpose.
You can see the body after
the sentence has been carried out.
But we talked about this.
Please stay here.
When the sentence is carried out,
we'll go together to view the body.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Where's the car?
What are you doing, Officer?
I said where's the car?!
Easy, Officer.
Haji!
Haji, the car... The car...
Where's the car, Haji?! Haji!
This wasn't the deal!
This wasn't the deal!
You dirty bastards!
You motherfucking bastards,
this wasn't the deal!
Haji!
Imam Reza...
What are they doing?
Imam Reza...
What are they doing?
You help me.
Help me, Imam Reza.
What are they doing?
What...
Let me get them for you.
- I'll go by myself.
- I'll help you carry them to the bus.
Thank you, there's no need.
Well...
Have a good trip,
and take care of yourself.
- You too.
- Thanks.
Also, don't put yourself
in dangerous situations.
I'm not always there to save you.
You know, I really enjoyed
having you here.
I had fun.
Not that type of fun, of course.
I meant...
I enjoyed working with you.
You know what I meant.
Bye.
I want to say this to
everyone watching.
If the police don't pull the plug
on this situation in the streets,
someone else like my dad will
rise up and follow in his footsteps.
They treat these women
as if they're normal people.
If it goes on like this,
there will be another Saeed Azimi.
To be honest,
from the moment he was arrested,
many asked me
to follow in his footsteps.
Let's wait and see what happens.
Whenever they arrived here,
my dad would shut the door,
lock it and take the keys with him.
Then, he'd give them some money,
and they'd stand here
and start counting it.
Meanwhile, my dad would
approach them from behind,
hold them by their necks
and squeeze as hard as possible.
Then, they would lose consciousness
and drop to the floor.
After dropping to the floor,
my dad would sit on top of them,
and put his knee on their necks.
Wait a moment.
Khadijeh, come here for a sec.
Ali, it's okay, just
show them with cushions.
No, wait a moment.
Come.
Lie down here with
your head in that direction.
A little bit further.
Lie down straight.
He'd sit on top of them
and put his knee on their necks like this.
And after that...
I won't do it, I'll just show you.
Then, he'd put his wrist on their mouths
while strangling them with the scarf.
That'd be it.
What about after that?
It requires a lot of strength.
But since they were addicted and weak,
there wouldn't be a problem,
he'd do it quickly.
What would he do with the body?
He'd find something
to cover the body with.
For example, like this...
I'm dead right now.
It's serious. They're filming you.
- Don't move.
- I'm dead.
What a clown!
All of it would take about a half hour.
Then, like, an hour
to get rid of the body.
So he'd take care of a prostitute
in less than two hours.
