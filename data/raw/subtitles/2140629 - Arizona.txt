This is
the cook's delight floor plan
with exotic granite island
and walk-in pantry.
Everything top-of-the-line.
There are solid birch cabinets
with Whisper Touch hinges.
Oh, and this dishwasher,
it's got a two-pump motor
that's virtually silent.
It's on right now.
You can't even hear it.
- I love the stainless steel.
- Yeah, it's so sophisticated.
It's definitely a lot of space.
It is a lot of space.
It's a lot of privacy.
No one right on top of you.
And if it's not enough space,
check this out.
- Whoa, is that safe?
- Well, it's a loophole.
They leave them unfinished so
they can push the square footage
on the other floors
to the single-family maximum,
and then you can get a permit
to finish the basement later.
So there's nothing down there?
Nope, nothing but possibility.
Saltwater pool,
which is great for your skin,
and if it's too modest for you,
we can upgrade to a princess
deck or a tanning ledge.
Yeah, pool's for the kids,
mostly.
Oh, wonderful.
How many do you have?
One from my first marriage,
two from the second.
I'm wife number three.
Well, third time's a charm.
Yeah, or three strikes,
you're out.
Fuck you, Barry.
Well, Harden is...
Harding is a wonderful place
to raise a family.
My daughter and I just moved
here, and she loves it.
There's...
It's probably just kids.
That does not sound like kids.
Shit, that's Mrs. Sherman.
Help me!
Help!
Shouldn't we call the police?
Please help me!
Hello?
Help!
How do you know how do to that?
They put these shit doors
on all these models.
Call the cops!
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Please!
- Jesus!
- Help me, please!
I don't know what happened.
- The bank.
- We got him.
We have to lift.
You're going to be okay.
He's going to be okay.
I'm going to hold him.
You go get a chair.
And we'll disconnect him.
Aah!
Aah!
No!
Kill me.
Just kill me.
Fucking kill me!
- How fun was that? Right?
- Fine.
Okay, I'll see you
in a couple weeks.
- You look gorgeous.
- Hey, sweetheart.
Hey, Mom.
I'll get a kiss next time.
So how was the weekend?
- Great.
- Yeah?
You know, I'm worried about her.
She's 14 and the product
of a broken home, so...
Yeah.
She's failing geometry.
Yeah, I don't know.
I talked to her teacher.
I don't know what
to say about that.
We don't have to get into it
right now,
but, you know, she could
come back to Phoenix.
You could both come back.
Oh. How's Kelsey?
Good. She's good.
Thanks for asking.
Come on, Cass.
All Morgan's friends are there.
It'd be good for her.
- My job is here.
- I know.
My home is here.
My life is here.
We're good.
Everything's fine.
Okay.
So should we get her a tutor?
And if it's a question of money,
I'm more than happy
to pay for it.
- I don't need your help.
- Okay.
Thank you.
I got it under control.
Okay. All right.
What's with the grass?
I think they're trying to do it
to keep the property values up.
Going around painting
all the dead lawns green.
Interesting.
- All right.
- Okay.
I'll see you in a couple weeks.
- All right.
- You look great.
No, I don't.
One more.
All right.
Here we go.
Give me a jab, right side.
Kick it out.
Looking good, baby!
This is stupid.
I gained like two pounds
last week.
- Did not.
- Double jab right here.
Two, two to the back.
You just got to
have fun with it.
Kick, punch, out, poo!
The boxer!
Up and ooh and ooh
and ooh and ooh and ooh!
You're so annoying.
Stop.
I'm annoying, but you love me.
Okay, super-healthy lunch today.
Great.
- What are you listening to?
- None of your business.
Oh, great, that's my favorite.
Were you smoking in here?
What?
No, I don't smoke.
Those are for clients.
What clients?
Madison's mom is going to
pick you guys up today.
- Cool?
- Are you showing our house?
No, although there has been
a lot of interest.
Good.
Can't fucking wait.
- Morgan.
- What?
It's going to get better.
How?
It just will. It does.
That's... That's how
things work, I promise.
I'm not stupid.
Bye.
Stupid mortgage industry
started treating
these nothing-down,
no-job, no-assets,
no-credit-record loans
as if they were prime loans,
as if they were real mortgages.
And they were crap.
Hello?
Can I speak to Cassandra Fowler?
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
She's not in.
Uh, I have this
as her personal cell.
Uh, nope, office, sorry.
Who am I talking to?
Uh, this is
Ms. Fowler's assistant.
- Do you have a name?
- Phoenix.
Well, Phoenix, this is Brenda
with Desert National
Bank and Trust.
I'm calling on Ms. Fowler's
mortgage payment
in addition to multiple...
Uh, I have someone
on the other line.
I'll have her call you as soon
as she gets in. Sorry, bye.
- Hey, Gary.
- Let me guess.
You're almost here, but you
got stopped at the train.
- I did.
- That's bullshit.
It's coming.
The least you could
fucking do is show up...
This motherfucker.
Yeah, take your fucking time.
Um, what is with
those fuck-me boots?
It's for the showing.
Well, that's a swing and a miss.
Next time I'd go
with high heels.
They give the illusion of longer
legs, which men find appealing.
If I had tits, I would sell
10 times as many houses.
I wish I had tits.
I'd have nice tits, too,
and I'd put them to work.
Why the fuck are you late?
Because I had to drop Morgan off
12 miles away.
It's not my fault there's
no high school in this town.
Why do you live here, then?
Because somebody
showed me a house
and told me it was a wonderful
place to raise a family.
That did happen, didn't it?
And I feel terrible about it,
and that is why you still
have a job here,
so if you think about it,
you should be on your knees
fucking thanking me for this.
Thank you, Gary.
That seemed disingenuous.
Hello?
- You fucking ingrate.
- Cassandra Fowler?
Uh, no, uh, she's still out.
Can I take a message?
So here's the deal, Cassandra.
You can play your little game,
but I'm going to keep
calling and calling.
Yes, yes, I know.
I, um...
I'm not playing any games.
Hey, Gary.
Oh, hey, man.
- Yes, yes.
- Hey, cool!
You may not have all day
to play with me...
- What's up, man?
- You didn't call.
Oh, uh...
I know. I know. I know. I know.
I have a, um... I know.
I have a showing later.
And the commission
on this would...
You have missed
six straight mortgage payments,
sweetie.
You can't shit a shitter.
Yeah, I'm not...
I'm... I'm not trying to...
I'm not shitting you, okay?
I-I promise.
- Did you fuckin' lie to me?
- I did not lie to you.
- That's what you fucking said.
- I did not lie to you.
Okay, so you didn't say
that my house
would double in its value
in two years?
Lie. You said, "Oh, everybody
takes an adjusted rate."
Another fucking lie.
- Hey, hey, moron!
- Hold on a second.
If you can't afford a house,
don't fucking buy it.
- There's some advice for you.
- Don't call me a fucking moron.
- I'm still here. Geez.
- No, I don't hold on.
Sorry. I just needed
to get somewhere quiet.
Look, Ms. Fowler,
I am trying to help you here.
Are you listening to me?
You don't blame the guy who sold
the idiot the magic beans.
You blame the idiot who traded
his cow for the magic beans.
That's not what happened
in the story.
- The magic beans work.
- Who gives a fuck about beans?
I'm not talk...
Get out of my fucking office.
Make me.
Fucking make me leave.
- What are you gonna do, hit me?
- You think I'm afraid of you?
Think I'm a-fucking-fraid?
Don't fucking hit me.
Fuck you are.
You motherfucking piece of shit!
Get out of here!
- No, I'm not!
- Don't forget.
Nonviolently, this company
will end your life.
I'm trying to save your life.
Again, I'm not threatening you.
This may sound like
a threat, and it's not,
but I'm trying
to save your life.
- You mother...
- Aah!
Gary?
Oh, fuck me.
Shit.
He attacked me.
That was an accident
'cause he was attacking me.
Okay.
We should call the cops.
No, no, no, no.
We shouldn't call the cops.
Gary's fine.
He just hit his head.
That's all. So there's not
any reason to bother the cops.
Okay, um, I want to call
the, uh, ambulance, please.
Okay, yeah.
Call an ambulance.
Yeah, why wouldn't
we call an ambulance?
Of course.
We got to help him.
Okay.
We could call the police, too.
Just let them know
that no one's hurt or anything
and that everything's okay
and that we're all fine.
I'm sorry.
I'm a really good person.
Hi.
How are you?
How do you feel?
How... How are you?
You okay?
Is that bag too heavy?
I put it on there
for the swelling.
It might be overkill.
You know,
I invented this product. Yeah.
I'm a small business owner.
Yeah, you know,
my ex-wife always liked
to put ice cubes in her wine,
but the problem was that,
once the ice cubes would melt,
it would just, like,
make the wine all, like, watery
and taste like shit,
so, one day, I was thinking...
lightbulb moment...
"What if the ice
was made of wine?"
That way, when it melted,
it would just make the wine,
like, have more wine.
I call it Wice... wine and ice.
Yeah. The guys from Big Lots
are really into the idea,
so there's that.
It could possibly happen,
which would be awesome.
I just want to apologize
to you, okay?
I never should have
struck you, okay?
That was uncalled for.
I-I don't know
where my head went.
I just panicked.
You know?
I'm in the middle of this
custody battle with my ex-wife,
and I just love my two sons
more than anything in the world,
and just the thought
of losing them, it just...
I don't know. I mean,
I can't really deal with it.
And I can't have
another run-in with the cops,
and, you know,
I'm just gonna say it aloud.
Gary is dead.
Oh, God.
I can't believe it myself.
Hey, buddy.
You know, I'm not saying
it's not my fault.
I mean, I do obviously
have a bad temper,
which is a good thing
in business.
I mean, you got to be a shark.
But it's really Gary's bad, too.
I mean, he should
never have started that.
I mean, he lied to me
and was rude to me
and called me a fucking moron,
and, to be honest, I thought
he was gonna catch himself,
but, instead, he just went
right over the thing.
It was gross.
Lefty likes you.
Hey.
Please don't kill me.
Would you like to take
a tour of my house?
This was Vicki's crafting room.
Now, I've changed it
into my personal gym. Up hers.
I'm gonna get so fucking ripped.
We spent a lot of time trying
to customize the standard plan.
This was basically
Vicki's dream bathroom...
his-and-hers sinks, Jacuzzi tub,
and heated tile floors.
Yeah, this is where the pool's
gonna go, right here.
I'm gonna do a little
swim-up bar right there.
It's gonna be sexy as hell.
Over there,
that's the golf course.
Yeah, we're supposed
to be on the 9th hole,
but they didn't, you know,
finish building the golf course.
I say that's breach of contract,
but apparently it wasn't
in the fucking contract.
So that's my bad again.
Criminals.
Oh, they don't play fair.
- Do you golf?
- No.
That's okay.
I'll teach you.
You know, I'm not supposed
to play because of my back,
but I still do
because I love it.
Yeah, sometimes, I feel like
it's the only thing
that keeps me sane.
Yeah, basically,
you can control the whole house
from this remote.
Like, I can pick
any song I want,
and I can just play it
whenever I want to.
Like, check this out.
Shit. It was supposed to play
Dave Matthews, "Ants Marching."
God damn it.
Okay, fuck it.
Come on. Let's go. Go.
This is the master bedroom,
obviously.
Oh, so, these are your kids?
Oh, yeah.
Chase and Penn.
Oh, they're a handful.
Always getting into trouble,
just like their old man.
That's my ex-wife.
Well, now I guess
I got to say first ex-wife.
And that's me.
I'm gonna reveal to you
my face now...
out of a sign of trust, okay?
We had these built-ins added
with the soft stop.
Oh, I also had them
install this.
Might want to take
a step back for this.
Lights, camera, action.
Yeah, boy!
How wild is that, huh?
Had this built so I could keep
them locked away from the boys.
Don't want anybody accidentally
shooting themselves, you know?
Yeah, this staircase
was also an upgrade.
I chose it 'cause
I thought it reminded me
of the staircase
from "Diff'rent Strokes."
- Did you ever watch that show?
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, I'm really sorry
about the mess, too.
We were going to redo
the tile on the countertops,
but you know what they say...
best laid plans...
Oh.
Maybe you can help
settle an argument.
Okay, I want you to be
completely honest with me, okay?
Which of these
do you like better?
Uh, that's so hard.
Well, I mean, it's granite.
You're gonna live
with that forever.
It's a really big decision.
Don't make fun of me.
I'm not.
Look, I know that
this whole thing is weird, okay?
I'm perfectly aware of how
strange this whole situation is.
I just wanted to show you the
house because this is my home.
It's who I am.
You know,
if they foreclose on me,
I'm gonna lose my boys.
Bye-bye, custody.
You have no idea
what that feels like.
I do.
I'm gonna lose my house, too.
And I haven't told anybody,
but I'm completely underwater.
Fuck.
That sucks, Cassie.
I'm sorry.
How did you know my name?
Gar...
Uh, Gary used to talk about you.
And then I also looked
in your wallet. Sorry.
But you look really nice
in your driver's license photo.
Fucking Gary.
I can't believe
that fucking guy.
I mean,
Gary sold me my house, too.
I mean, it's not as nice
as yours, but it's a good house.
It's a really good house,
and now it's not worth anything,
and I'm stuck
in this fucking mess.
I'm pissed!
I'm really pissed!
I'm sorry.
So you know where
I'm coming from. You get it.
We're good people. We don't
belong in this situation.
- No, we're victims. Yeah.
- Exactly.
You know, we don't have
to be against each other.
The world's probably better off
with an asshole like Gary gone.
- Right?
- We did somebody else a favor,
- probably.
- I fucking hate him.
Okay.
Let's just be adults
about this, okay?
We can come to
a reasonable solution to this.
Okay, this is
what we're gonna do.
All right.
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Thank you.
- If, if, if, if, if...
- Thank you!
...if you promise me
you will never tell anyone
- about this.
- I promise.
You can't even talk about this
years from now.
- You can't tell a fucking soul.
- Okay, I promise.
Say that you were, like,
on a showing or something.
- You didn't see anything.
- Right. I didn't.
Yeah. What happened?
I don't know.
Someone died?
Who gives a fuck?
- Okay.
- All right. Fine.
- Thank you.
- Good. No, thank you.
Okay.
Okay, this is done.
Good, good, good, good, good,
good, good, good.
Okay. Here we go.
Okay.
The only thing that
doesn't really connect for me
is, if you hate Gary so much,
then why were you
sleeping with him?
I wasn't sleeping with him.
That's not what he said.
Oh, God,
he's such a fucking liar!
I would never sleep with him!
Yeah, yeah, he is
a fucking liar.
I mean, and that would be
a pretty crazy lie, too,
'cause you guys don't even seem
like you'd make a good couple,
and, plus, you're married,
so that'd be totally uncool.
Well, I...
I'm not married, actually.
I just wear the ring
to help me sell more houses.
- To lie?
- What?
You wear your ring
to lie to people?
- No, I-I, um...
- You just say
whatever you got to say
to close the deal, don't you?
No, I mean, I was married.
This is my actual wedding ring.
Lefty, shut up!
I'm just...
I'm not married anymore.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"I'm in the same boat as you!
Gary did this." I almost
felt bad for you there.
I was thinking we're in the same
position, but we're not.
You're one of the fucking
assholes who put me here!
Lefty, shut the fuck up!
God damn it!
I'm gonna have to
take him out for a walk
because he's not gonna shut up
until he takes a shit, okay?
That's the bottom line.
I know how he operates.
And I'm tying you back up.
Get over here. Get over here!
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Stay right there.
Stay there.
Don't move. Don't move.
I can fucking throw
this knife at you.
Don't move.
Don't move, Cassie!
Go, go, go.
Get over there.
Get over there.
Okay, sit down.
Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.
What, do they teach
a seminar to you guys,
just how to lie to people?
Like, how to bullshit people,
how to trick people?
Is that what they do?
Do you teach that seminar?
I tried to be cool,
and you just lied to me.
Stop. Cassie.
God damn it.
Stop it. Stop it. Don't.
This is a Ginsu knife
from fucking Kohl's, okay?
It will cut through bone
like butter.
I don't want to do it, but
I'll start right above the knee
and cut you
to the fucking white meat.
All righty?
Don't be an asshole.
I don't know why they make
duct tape
so goddamn hard to get off!
God damn it!
It's like a cheap-ass roll
of fucking toilet paper
that just keeps ripping.
Uh-huh.
Damn it.
- Ow.
- All right.
I'm gonna be back here
in seven to eight minutes, okay?
Now, you can scream
if you want to,
'cause I know you probably will,
but you should know
that the closest occupied house
is, like...
like, four cul-de-sacs away.
Hey, buddy.
There's my buddy!
Buddy, wanna go for a walk, huh?
Who's a good...
Hello?
Shit.
- What the fuck?
- What the hell are you doing?
You're not allowed
to just show up here anymore.
- What am I doing?
- Ah, fuck me!
- What is this?
- Please call the police.
- No, no! Don't, don't!
- Well, then tell me who she is.
Okay, she, uh...
There was an accident.
- He killed somebody.
- Shut up!
You fucking killed somebody?!
- Gary.
- Who... Who...
- Gary, our real-estate guy?
- The real-estate guy, yes.
It wasn't my fault, though. He
was supposed to catch himself.
Oh, my God.
You are such an idiot.
If it's an accident, most people
call the goddamn police.
I know!
I'm not thinking straight.
- Please, please! Help me.
- No, no.
You don't need help.
She doesn't need help.
I'm not gonna do anything
to her. I don't even know her.
I'm just retaining her to make
sure she doesn't tell anyone.
You're retaining her?
With duct tape?
If she promises
not to say anything,
then I'm just gonna let her go.
That was our deal, right?
Right?
- Please call the fucking cops!
- Why would you say that?!
Okay, I gotta get out of here.
- No, you're not leaving.
- No, I'm leaving.
- No, no!
- No, this is your thing.
- You deal with this.
- You're not fucking leaving.
- I'd like to see you stop me.
- Vicki, don't...
Aah!
You are such an asshole.
Goddamn, Cassie!
Hold still.
- Mm!
- Oops.
What are you doing?
You don't think
if something happens to me,
you'll be the first person
people look for?
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?
But you're a part of this now.
All right?
If you back out,
I'm gonna tell everybody
that you're an accomplice.
An accomplice you had to tie
to a chair to keep here?
- Prove it.
- Okay, how about all the bruises
all over my arms and legs
from the fucking duct tape?
I don't know. Maybe you enjoy
being tied up during sex...
with Randall, the pool guy.
Okay, smart-ass, how are
you gonna explain the big,
giant baseball-sized egg
on the back of my head?
- Fucking moron!
- You see how she talks to me?
Constant nagging.
Guess what.
We're not married anymore,
remember?
That means I don't have
to listen to anything you say.
Oh, like you listened...
like he listened so good before.
You just shut up, okay?
Shh!
Here's the plan.
We're gonna take Gary's body,
and we're gonna chop it up,
okay?
We're gonna, like,
mush it into something.
Then we'll burn him out...
with acid, not fire.
We'll have to take care
of the teeth. I realize that.
But we'll figure that out, okay?
Then we're gonna take
his house keys,
and we're gonna put them
inside his mailbox.
People will just think that
he got underwater on his house,
and he disappeared in the middle
of the night. Cinchy.
I'm not helping you
with any of that.
Oh, yes, you will.
Bet me you're not gonna do it.
Sonny, what are
you gonna do with her?
You gonna kill her, too?
No.
I'm not gonna kill Cassie.
I'm just gonna hold her here
till you and I
can see eye to eye, okay?
And you don't think anybody's
gonna notice she's missing?
Who?
Her boss is dead.
The wedding-ring thing's
a total sham.
She's not married.
She told me she's single.
I got all the answers
out of her.
- I have a daughter.
- Huh?
I live with my daughter.
Jesus, Cassie!
What the fuck?!
- Oh, my God.
- Damn it!
- You are fucking unbelievable!
- Fuck you!
Look, smart people don't
get away with murder, Sonny!
What do you think
you're gonna do, Mr. GED?
Shut up! I'm trying to get it
under control, God damn it!
Oh, you're trying. He's trying.
Yeah, he's always trying.
That's the thing.
He tries so hard.
It's not his fault
he fucks everything up.
You are so stupid.
- I fuck everything up? Yeah?
- Yeah.
All I did was provide for you.
I took you to fucking Bermuda.
You took me to your uncle's
piece-of-shit time-share.
In May! That's a really hard
month to book in a time-share.
You have to use
all your fucking points.
- I bought you a house.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
- Are you dead goddamn serious?
- Yes! Yes, this house.
- This house?
The one they're about
to take from you?
You are pathetic.
Hey, Sonny,
let me ask you a question,
just 'cause we haven't
chitchatted in a while.
Um, how's that wine
ice cube business doing?
It's fucking Wice!
Vic? Vicki?
Oh, God.
No!
Vicki?
Oh, fuck.
Oh.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh. Oh.
Holy...
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck!
I think we killed her.
Okay, Vic.
Come on.
Oh!
Ohh.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Ohh.
Why did she have to do this?
Why couldn't
she have just been nice?
She should have been nice.
She should have been nice.
She shouldn't have been mean
to you.
She should have been nice.
- It's okay.
- Will you tell the truth?
About what?
About your daughter.
Do you have a daughter?
No.
So you were lying?
This was all for nothing?
You're still lying.
She's only 14.
One more!
All right. Give me
a step-touch to the back.
Take it down and up.
One more.
All right. Here we go.
Give me a jab right side.
Take it out.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Are you, uh,
Cassie Fowler's daughter?
What's going on?
Well, there's not really
an easy way to say this,
but your mother's been
in a horrific car accident,
and she sent me here
to come bring you to her.
Oh, my God.
Fuck. Um, hold on.
It's pretty intense.
There's been a lot of bleeding.
We don't have to call anyone
because I can just take you
to where she's at.
We can just go ahead and get
there now if you open this door.
Huh.
You know, she gave me her phone
so that I could call you.
But you didn't call me.
Well, you know, if I got lost.
Okay, we don't really
have a lot of time.
Your mom's life depends on...
- I'm gonna call my dad.
- No, you're not.
Oh! Get out!
Oh, my God!
- Ow! Ow!
- Aah! Aah!
Get out!
Get out!
Aah!
Where is it?
911.
What's your emergency?
There's someone in my house.
Oh, an intruder?
Okay.
And are you at 539 Sunset Lane?
- Yeah, please come.
- And where are you?
In my mom's room.
Oh, okay.
And, uh, where exactly is that?
What?
I just need to be able
to tell my officers
where they should go to once
they arrive at the homestead.
Upstairs.
Upstairs?
Okay.
The bedroom. It's right
down the end of the hall.
Well, stay where you are.
Someone will be there
in one second, okay?
Aah!
Get back here!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Fucking phone!
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Where does your dad live?
Does he live close to here?
- No.
- Good.
So, what's up with him?
Why did him and your mom
get a divorce?
Hey, what, you find a fry
in there or something?
- Shut up!
- You shut up.
Knock that shit off.
Actually, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
I have kids, and that was mean.
Aah! Aah!
Oh.
Fuck.
Come on.
Wipe your feet. I don't need
you tracking dirt clods in here.
Aw, Jesus Christ, buddy!
You're a mess!
- Is that blood?
- Yes, God damn it.
That's a bad boy!
Get outside!
Outside... now!
Oh, fuck me.
We're gonna whup that ass.
Oh, my...
Down! Down!
I need your phone!
- What the fuck?
- I need your phone.
- What for? Why?
- 'Cause there's been a murder!
Oh, shit.
- Um, they're not paying me.
- What?
They haven't paid me
in like two months,
so I don't think I should have
to, like, do anything dangerous.
- I need your fucking phone!
- Calm down.
The water bill
has literally tripled
since you moved in here.
Unbelievable.
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- Scott, it's Cass.
Hey, Cass.
What's up?
- Whose number is this?
- It's some kid's.
Look, I think
something happened to Morgan.
- What?
- Can you just get here? Shit.
The cops are here.
I can't talk.
First, tell me what happened.
I need you to come to the
Los Campos de Oro subdivision.
- Can you come up?
- Okay, look...
I don't know where I'm gonna be,
and I don't have my cell.
- Can you get here?
- Okay, look,
it's rush hour,
so it's gonna take me forever.
Scott, I need your help!
Please, can you come?!
Just leave now!
Fuck.
What shit
is Queen Cassie pulling now?
Something's happened to Morgan.
I don't... I don't know
what's going on.
I got to go.
Now?
- Did you call in a homicide?
- Yes.
There's a man inside there.
He has my daughter.
- And he's killed two people.
- So, a man has your daughter?
- And he's in there now?
- Yes, I think.
Do you think he has
your daughter, or do you think
- he's in there now?
- Both.
- Okay, this man...
- Can I have my phone back?
- What?
- My phone, my iPhone.
- That cost like 400 bucks.
- Yeah, here.
Here's your phone.
So, this man you think has
your daughter, do you know him?
I don't know his name.
I know his first name is Sonny.
- I don't know his last name.
- Do you know where Sonny lives?
I don't know his address,
but if we drive in there,
I think I can find it.
Excuse me.
How many exits does
this luxury experience have?
This is the gate.
It's the only way in or out
unless you want to,
like, climb over a wall.
Do you know
where this Sonny lives?
I don't know
any of these assholes.
You think any of them
know my name?
Oh, my God!
Would it be too much to ask for
you to check on your PC there?
Okay.
No, we don't have a Sonny.
- Might be an alias.
- Look, he worked with my boss,
so when your backup gets here,
we can look on their computer.
There is no backup, ma'am.
- What?
- Well, about four years ago,
this was
a nice agricultural community.
We weren't
even incorporated then.
So, in four years
of population growth,
no one thought to expand
the police force
to, say, like,
two fucking people?!
Do you know how long
it takes a state task force
- to perform the "mandatory"...
- What are we going to do?!
Well, you said you know
where the house is, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, then hi-yo,
motherfucking Silver.
Would you put that fucking thing
in the glove compartment
before somebody sees you?
It's not a toy.
- I thought you hated guns.
- I do.
Why can't I hold it?
- I, like, grew up shooting.
- Because I said so, honey.
That's why.
- Please?
- No.
- Pretty please?
- No.
- Why did you even bring it?
- I don't know.
Cassie just never sounds scared
like that,
so I brought it, um,
you know, just in case.
Mm. In case you need to gun
some motherfucker down.
In case
I need to protect my family.
- My daughter.
- Mm. Okay.
So, where are the bullets?
- In the trunk.
- What?!
- Yeah. Why?
- Seriously?
- Yes.
- You know they could go off
- back there if it gets too hot?
- Are you fucking serious?
No.
- Oh, you're such a dork.
- That's good. That's good.
God help us if you actually
have to shoot somebody.
Just...
I-I... It's got to be
one of these streets.
Go to the stop sign
and take a left.
Go, go.
Please, go.
And then
take a left right there.
Okay.
Yeah, okay. Up there.
Up there on the right.
No offense.
How can you tell?
- They all look identical.
- Rock lawn, tree, big rock.
- That's it.
- They all got rock lawns.
Yeah, but not right
on the golf course.
Hey, look, I am a Realtor,
and I show houses
in this neighborhood,
so I know
what I'm talking about.
All right.
Let's go.
He's got a lot of guns.
So do I.
You should stay back.
Aah!
Stay back!
Aah!
Damn it!
God damn it!
God damn it!
Who'd I shoot?
- Who the fuck did I shoot?
- Oh, my God.
- This isn't the house.
- You said it was the house.
God damn it!
Oh, God.
You called the cops?
No, no, I didn't.
I-I...
- Oh, you didn't?
- I mean, I didn't mean to.
Cassie, I'm not stupid, okay?
You're stupid.
I saw you guys drive
right past my house like idiots.
I mean, who even lives here?
Her?
Well, look.
Now you killed someone, too.
It was an accident.
Oh.
Welcome to the club.
Where's my daughter?
Well, for your information,
I brought her here
so you and I
could work out a little deal.
Then, like you do,
you lied to me...
again!
I went to your house, Cassie.
- Okay. So?
- My house is nicer than yours?
Fuck you!
Italian ceramic tile floors?
Italian fucking
ceramic tile floors?!
You don't think I know how much
that fucking update costs?
Aw, fuck!
My back!
My back, my back.
Oh!
I pulled my back out.
Crap.
Oh, crap.
Oh, my God.
Get back here!
Get back here!
Fuck! Aah!
You stay right there.
Oh! I can still end this,
motherfucker.
Oh, crap!
Oh, crap.
Oh, my God.
Aah. Okay.
I'm so sorry
that I was mean to you.
God damn it!
Aah!
I really need your help, okay?
Fuck.
Catch them.
What's this?
You're driving.
I want you to back that car out,
park it in the street,
pull the cop car in here, okay?
You can't leave it out there
in broad daylight,
and I can't be getting
in and out of cars
with my fucking back.
It's the worst.
And if you even think about
driving out of here without me,
let me just tell you
that something very, very bad
is gonna happen
to your daughter, okay?
How do I know you even have her?
Well, is that a risk
you're willing to take?
Oh, I got to get this.
It's my son.
Hey, handsome!
How are you, buddy?
Yeah, I'm having a good day.
Good, good.
That's awesome, man.
That's so cool.
Yeah. You have
a good day at school?
Well, I told you
I'm gonna get the tickets,
so, of course,
I'm gonna get them.
This is unbelievable.
So, tell me something...
Where the fuck
are all these people going?
I don't understand why we can't
just call Cassie and ask...
She doesn't have a phone,
Kelsey.
Okay, but who calls
somebody up and says,
"Oh, there's
this big emergency,"
and then doesn't give
any details?
- A fucking manipulator, is who.
- See, the cops came, Kelsey.
Right?
So it's obviously an emergency.
- Yeah, sure.
- God.
You're always defending her.
You're always defending her.
She's just dragging you.
You're just fucking taking it.
- She's such a bitch to you.
- She should be.
I was a bad husband.
Okay, but you're a good father.
- I had sex with someone else.
- Oh, no. Everybody does.
It's fine.
You weren't happy.
No, I actually was.
I just, uh, you know,
wanted something better.
And now you found it.
Absolutely.
You kidding me?
Jackpot.
- Baby.
- Mom? Mom?
- It's me. It's me.
- Mom?
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- Why is this happening?
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?
- Tell me why this is happening.
- Everything is gonna be okay.
- I don't want you to worry.
- Tell me why.
I don't want you to worry.
Are you seriously not gonna
tell me what's going on?
- Honey, just listen to me, okay?
- Where's Dad?
He's not here.
He's not coming.
- Why not?
- Because I didn't call him,
because I can handle this
myself.
What's your problem?
What did Dad ever do to you?
Look, I don't want to talk to
you about this right now, okay?
Are you fucking me?!
Okay, okay.
We're not gonna do that.
All right?
My back is killing me here.
I got my dead ex-wife
staring at me,
and I'm not gonna hear you two
bicker with each other,
all right?
I need everyone to be nice
to each other
and shut the fuck up
until it gets dark.
Okay? Aah!
Aah.
Then we will bury this bitch
like civilized people.
Okay?
Just sit here and relax.
I'll put some TV on.
God damn it.
Okay. Okay.
We're not gonna watch TV.
No one's watching TV.
Okay?
We're just gonna sit here
and look at each other.
How about that?
Bodies are, like,
super-heavy, right?
I'm sorry
I can't help y'all carry her.
It's just, I can't take
the risk with my back.
You know, one time,
I was in bed for eight days
because I tried to tie my shoes.
You never can tell
where it's gonna flare up,
what it will do.
Come on.
You can do it.
Let's go.
Let's do this. Move.
Fucking creepy out here.
Not trying to be out here
all night.
- Oh! Oh, Mom.
- Jesus Christ.
- Are you okay?
- My knee!
Well, I guess this is
as good a place as any.
For what?
Haven't you ever seen
a movie before?
To dig a grave.
- Just for her, right?
- Well, for her and Gary.
The cop can stay where he's at.
Unless, of course, you think
there may be more bodies.
I'm kidding with you, Cassie.
Come on!
You know I'm not gonna kill you.
We're good again. We're fine.
My back is royally fucked.
I can't be carrying dead bodies
around and burying people.
I need you guys, okay?
We're in this together.
We're a team.
Check it out.
Candle mode.
Pretty cool, huh?
Looks like
Vicki has a glowing penis.
All right, kid. Get up.
- Start digging.
- She's a child.
Oh, what? Kids aren't
expected to work anymore?
You know, I was 10 years old
when I had my first job. 10.
She's scared.
You know what?
Whatever, Mom. It's fine.
See, Mom?
It's fine. Whatever.
10 years old.
I was doing fashion shows
for JCPenney's.
- Male fashions.
- Hm.
I was such a handsome boy.
Do you smell that?
Is that her?
Is that Vicki?
Ugh.
It's crazy that bodies
start stinking so quickly.
Oh.
Jesus Christ.
Okay, seriously,
how long is this gonna take?
I don't know.
I never dug a grave before.
What, and I have?
Come on, don't be a smart-ass,
Cassie. What do you think?
You can make an estimate.
Can't you?
I don't know.
2 hours... 20.
20 hours?
Cassie.
Cassie, look at me.
You're gonna do it
in 30 minutes. Do you hear me?
I don't care
what the fuck it takes.
You're doing it.
30 minutes.
Well, the only way it can
get done is by shoveling.
Okay, well, then shovel more,
okay?
Or faster. Or whatever the hell
it takes to get the dirt
out of the fucking ground.
3-O, 30 minutes.
- Police.
- Bullshit.
- God damn it, Cassie!
- Come on, Morgan.
What the fuck?!
Ow!
Oh, my fucking back!
Oh!
Oh, fuck, Cassie!
I hope you knocked
his fucking teeth out.
God damn it.
Aah!
Cassie! I told you
I wasn't gonna kill you!
Come on, baby!
Run.
Cassie!
Oh, fuck.
Ohh!
Cassie, you can't hide!
I will find you!
Oh, my God.
This way.
This way.
This way.
Fucking bitch!
Here. Be careful.
Mom, use this.
I don't even want
to know why you have a lighter.
Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.
Ow.
Okay.
Sewer pipe, sewer rats.
Aah.
Okay. Come on.
Come.
Go, go, go.
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
All right.
Try and figure it out.
Up to the street we go.
Cassie!
I know you're down there.
Okay.
Dad's coming.
I couldn't tell you back there,
but I called him.
- Thank God.
- He's gonna find us.
- Now where?
- Well, she said,
"Go to one
of these developments."
Oh, shit. The something.
Something Spanish.
Yeah, but what do
I put in the GPS?
I don't know. I don't know
how to work that fucking thing.
Why are you awful?
You don't know how to work shit!
Jesus!
God!
How you doing?
I'm looking
for one of these, uh,
housing developments
around here.
A gated community.
- Which one?
- I don't remember.
That's the problem.
I know it's something Spanish.
The developments
all have Mexican names
and no Mexicans living in them.
Okay. How many developments
do you think there are?
9 or 10.
Was it something "de Oro"?
Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. De Oro.
- There's five of them.
- Okay.
There's Mesa Ridge de Oro,
Dominio de Oro, Pointa de Oro,
Orroyo de Oro,
Los Campos de Oro.
Okay. I guess they just think
it sounds fancy or something.
Because what says fancy
like Mexico?
Right.
We should probably be
under the tennis courts by now.
Okay, okay.
Be ready to run.
Okay?
- Is he out there?
- I don't know.
What are we gonna do
if he's out there?
Shh, shh.
Go.
Great shot!
Huh.
Come on, baby.
We're so close.
We're almost there.
Come on, baby.
- Ow! My ankle!
- Come on, baby. Come on.
Oh, come on, honey.
- We're so close.
- My ankle.
I know,
but we've got to keep moving.
I want Dad.
Look, I can get us
out of here, okay?
- But you got to keep moving.
- I can't.
Yes, you can. Look, this guy,
he's gonna kill us.
- I want Dad.
- Stop saying that.
I want Dad.
What is Dad gonna do for you?
I've been tricked!
Seen any police here in
about the past three hours?
No? No one around?
Thank you.
This is it...
right here. Okay. Come on.
All right, kid.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Okay.
Strike two.
Fuck.
I think this is it.
Come on, Mom.
Go faster.
Aah!
- You're gonna kill us!
- Shit!
- Whoa!
- Shit! Get down! Stay down!
- Aah!
- Yeah! Fuck, yeah!
Aah! Shit!
Okay.
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- I think so.
Hey. You hungry, huh?
You want to get
them bunnies, huh?
We got to run.
- Morgan, come on!
- Wanna eat them fucking bunnies?
Let's go.
Assholes and elbows.
Go on!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- You better run!
- Come on! Go, go!
Run!
No, go on!
Them!
No, no, no.
Unh-unh.
Unh-unh.
No, fucking them!
Aah!
Oh, fuck!
Aah!
Get over there!
Fucking asshole!
Aah!
Aw, fuck.
Nasty.
Look.
There's a light.
Hold it back in.
Okay.
- Ow! Oh!
- You okay?
- Oh! I cut my hand.
- You okay?
- My hand.
- Let me see.
Okay.
Shit.
God damn it.
Fuck!
Oh, shit.
Welcome to, uh,
Los Campos de Oro.
Jesus.
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm doing good.
This isn't my blood.
This guy
got into a car accident.
He, like, jumped the curb and
smashed into that transformer,
and, uh...
But nobody got hurt.
I mean, except for him.
He got hurt.
Uh, you know, he got hurt.
He broke his arm,
and, like, the bone came out.
- It was pretty gross.
- Right, so, when was this?
Uh, I think the ambulance left,
like, 20 minutes ago.
I was actually gonna go home
and clean up and get a shower,
but I got to wait
for the tow truck.
So, where are the police?
That's a damn good question.
You know, there's only,
like, one cop in the town,
so if he gets
more than two calls, he's...
Okay.
That might actually be...
Uh, I'm looking for my wife.
- Wow.
- What?
My ex-wife and my daughter.
- She called you?
- Yeah.
From here
or somewhere around here.
She was with the cops,
and this is about, you know,
like, three hours ago maybe.
Well, you see, that would have
been before my shift.
Okay. Well, could you maybe call
who was ever working before you?
And maybe they'd have some
information that you might...
That'd be impossible.
I don't have
the phone number of the guy
who works the shift before here
because we're enemies.
We're not friends.
He slept with my wife.
Ex-wife.
I'll tell you what.
If your ex-wife
and your daughter are in here,
I'll help you find them.
- Great. Thank you.
- Yeah.
What kind of car is this?
- It's a BMW.
- Yeah, no shit.
What series?
It's a 5 Series.
Oh, 5, nice.
- Is anybody in here?
- I don't know.
Do you want anybody
to be in here?
Cassie!
Morgan!
You're doing good!
Keep yelling!
Cassie!
- Morgan!
- Louder!
What's going on?
Get back in your house, sir.
Sonny?
Oh, hey.
What's up, Dave?
Why are you...
Are you a security guard?
Well, you don't
have to judge, Dave.
You get a job where you
can get a job, okay?
Paycheck's a paycheck.
Am I right?
Well, I guess so.
We're... We're looking
for two women.
Have you seen anybody
by any chance walking around?
Don't talk to him.
He doesn't even know what
fucking planet he's on.
Just keep yelling their names.
Cassie!
Morgan!
Phone.
Cassie!
Morgan!
- Dad?
- Stay here!
Cassie!
Morgan!
Are you sure that's their names?
Cassie!
Scott!
Hit him!
Hit him!
What'd she say, to hit him?
Run him over!
Aaah!
Nailed it.
Why aren't you wearing a shirt?
How do you think you're
going to get away with this?
Oh, come on, Cassie, how can
this get any worse for me?
I mean, I can kill four people
and leave one witness
to fucking identify me
to the police,
or I kill seven people,
and I got a fighting chance
to get to Mexico
before the cops put out
an Amber Alert.
You don't have to kill us.
Oh, wait, my bad.
Eight people.
I forgot about your daughter.
Yeah, it's one, two,
three, four, five, six.
Yeah. It's eight.
Look, I'm sorry, Cassie.
You know I didn't want it
to end like this.
Stop apologizing.
You're a bad person.
Oh, I'm a bad person?
You're a bad person, Cassie.
You looked at honest,
hardworking people,
and you fucking lied to them.
You told them that
buying these houses
was going to be a good
investment, and it wasn't!
You're a fucking bad person.
You are not a good person!
You're not a fucking
good person!
- I'm a fucking great person!
- No, you're not!
Yes, I am!
I fucking had a family!
I bought a fucking house!
I started a business!
I mean, all I wanted to do
was make it easier
for people to put ice
in their wine!
What the fuck?
Huh.
Oh, fuck, yeah!
How fucking awesome!
Mom?
- Morgan?
- Over here.
I found these.
I know I don't always
tell you the truth,
but I'm going to tell you
the truth right now, okay?
You are a great fucking kid.
Thanks, Mom.
Fucking criminals.
Cassie.
Cassie, I know you're in here.
Come out.
Cassie.
Come on, Cassie.
This is starting to get old.
This is starting
to get real fucking old.
Jesus.
Cassie.
I killed your ex-husband.
You're welcome.
Come on, Cassie.
I'm gonna find you.
Oopsie.
Eeny, meeny, miny...
Fuck it.
Ah! Ah!
Aah!
Fucker!
Fuck!
Ah!
Mom!
Cassie, help!
Help!
Help.
Fuck you!
- Ah!
- Aaaah!
