<b>Based on a true story and
performeded by the people of Yakel.</b>
Since the beginning of time
the chiefs have
arranged marriage
along the Kastom Roads
but two lovers chose to
walk a different path...
TANNA
Selin.
Selin.
My friend has come back to the village.
Can you cook the taros?
I want to go now.
Selin come back.
- Where is Taboo?
- Not here.
Hold tight.
- Where is the taboo place?
- Here.
Catch her.
Get Selin.
We'll hide. You find us.
I've missed you.
You've been away too long.
You're all grown up now.
A beautiful butterfly.
You catch a lot of butterflies like that?
Selin, go away!
- How did you find me?
- I know all your hiding places.
What did you see?
I saw you playing with
the chief's grandson.
Don't say anything to mom or dad.
They'll get angry.
Do you want me to lie for you?
Stop following me everywhere I go.
When you wear this skirt, Wawa.
the boys will be falling over
themselves to catch you.
Hold onto it and run for your life!
Wawa, you'll look as beautiful as your
grandmother when she was very young.
I obviously didn't
run fast enough.
Mum I'm tired of doing this.
I want to play with my friends.
We're making this skirt
for your initiation.
You're not child anymore.
Do you understand?
Selin, go help your
mother and sister.
The men will work here.
Go on.
I told you to help your mother.
Father, Selin doesn't listen to us.
Can you help?
Yes, it is time.
Hurry, get my penis sheath!
Catch her, she
stole my  penis sheath.
Selin.
Selin, come back.
 Selin is going into the taboo place.
Hey Selin, come back.
Selin, what are you doing
running into forbidden ground?
The Imedin have killed
our people here.
Never come here again.
Their warriors are everywhere.
This is not yours to take.
Sorry.
Get moving. I don't know
what's got into you.
Your grandfather is taking you
to Yahul to teach you respect.
When we return from the waterfall, we'll
show the men you are now a woman.
Put some coconut oil on my
hard-working bum and belly.
Wawa...
Soon the chiefs will arrange your
marriage to another tribe.
You'll sit with me to learn about
being a good wife
and a good mother.
You are a woman now.
Put some more paint
on her beautiful cheeks.
We'll show you off.
Thank you.
Wawa,
you disappeared after the ceremony?
Where did you go?
I was playing with my friends Grandma.
Good morning sleepy head.
Are you ready for your big journey?
Hey, where are you going?
I'm taking you to Yahul,
our Spirit Mother.
Is it far?
It's time you learned
the meaning of respect
If you want to go anywhere
ask your parents first.
You have to start being more responsible.
Where are you?
Cicadas.
Thanks, but are you listening to me?
It can be dangerous out here so don't
wander off again.
If your mother and father
tell you to do anything,
you must obey them.
You must never refuse...
Never touch these mushrooms.
They're poisonous.
Poisonous.
But they look like the ones mum cooks.
I know, but never eat the
ones which grow on trees...
The Yakel shaman is going to Yahul.
He's the one who made our crops fail.
See that bay?
That's where Captain Cook landed.
All across the island people
have left the old ways.
They've become lost.
Our tribes are the last
keepers of Kastom.
We have to hold it tight to survive.
Yahul has been here
longer than any of us.
She is the source of
life, love and Kastom.
When you look into Her hart
you will understand.
Don't be afraid of Her.
Let's get closer.
I feel Her.
Her warmth.
I hear Her.
- She's talking to me.
- That's right.
You've been given a special gift.
Grandpa!
Run!
They attacked Grandpa.
Dad, they attacked Grandpa.
They attacked Grandpa.
What happened?
I think they killed him.
- Who did?
- The Imedin.
My father has been attacked.
It's the Imedin again.
Let's get them.
He's still in Yahul.
Selin has been running all night.
Come back, we need to know more.
Tell me what you saw.
I saw the Imedin club his head.
They also killed my parents.
We have to keep calm.
We are losing all our people.
Calm down, calm down.
Selin, show us where your grandfather is.
Yes, bring
our Shaman back.
Lingai, take Kawerin, Jonny,
Waha,
and Dain.
Bring hom home.
Lingai.
Keep an eye on my my grandson.
Don't let him do anything foolish.
His breath is weak.
Grandpa, I've brought
Dad and the warriors.
If we hurry, we can save him.
The Imedin can't get away with this.
His strenght is fading.
We need to move him now.
Dain and Selin...
run ahead and tell the medicine man.
I'm worrised about his breathing.
Hurry. Run!
We are coming.
He's started bleeding again.
Gather your strength and
drink this medicine.
Drink old man.
Lift it up.
This is bad. We're
defenceless without our Shaman.
My medicines aren't strong enough.
I don't think he'll survive the night.
Father.
Feel all your people here.
Say something to them.
Wisdom comes through suffering,
killing only brings sorrow.
One side struggles for power,
the other takes revenge.
Divided children of Tanna,
join together in peace.
The Spirit Mother revealed
the same song to both of us.
It's time for peace.
The song speaks of peace,
but our enemies are still attacking us.
It's only fair we kill one of them.
Listen to the song.
It's telling us forgiveness
is the only way,
to bring the Kastom Roads together.
You want the tribe to survive?
This song of peace will
bring our Shaman back.
I'd like you to listen to the words again.
Wisdom comes through suffering.
killing only brings sorrow.
One side struggles for power,
the other takes revenge.
Divided children of Tanna,
join together in peace.
Go back to our beginnings.
Hear the wisdom of the ancestors
and live once more in harmony.
Follow me.
This one.
We'll take these kava
cuttings to the garden,
where your parents were killed,
and plant them.
Then we'll take the root
to the Peacemaking Chief.
Don't break it's roots.
You must dig kava with respect.
Drinking kava,
deepens understanding.
It's sacred to all the Kastom Roads,
and will guide us on the path to peace.
It's time to begin new life here.
Your parents' garden is yours now.
Let's clear it
and plant the kava cuttings.
Your father's digging stick.
I loved your father as
you did.
Now we only have each other.
We have each other.
I want revenge.
If you want to be a good chief one day,
you must move beyond revenge.
Dain, what's wrong?
The Imedin slit
my father's throat.
My grandfather telling me to forget that.
I can't stop thinking about what I saw.
They speared my mother.
When I found her in the
garden, she was still alive.
I picked her up and held her.
She looked up at me and tried
to say something,
but the spear had gone
through her chest.
I'll never forgive them.
I want my revenge.
Dain, I couldn't bear the thought of that
happening to my father and mother.
But we can't keep doing
terrible things to each other.
We need to live without fear.
Would you want our kids to
live under this threat?
Our kids?
It might happen that one
day we have children.
How will this happen?
The Peacemaking Chief has ordered
the Kastom Roads to come together.
He wants us to Bury the
Club with the Imedin today.
The Imedin are here.
Kastom Roads, listen carefully.
You, Charlie must stop the killing.
You, Mikum, must also stop.
There's been too much blood spilt.
I order you to share the land
you've been fighting over.
Mikum,
Charlie.
Now exchange pigs and the kava,
to open the path to peace.
The Imedin man wearing tusks
clubbed Grandpa.
Mikum,
Mikum, the Spirit Mother told me
the hatred between us must end.
I wantyour people, and my
people to unite in peace.
I have heard you, Charlie.
I respect the authority of
the Chiefs gathered here.
He looks like he's came
out of a hollow tree.
Look at him. He's so black
you can't see his eyes.
Mother, keep quiet so we can
hear the Chiefs.
Look at him. He thinks he's so fierce.
We want to Bury the Club with you,
and honour all agreements
we make today.
We're moving towards a settlement, Charlie.
We'll seal the peace properly
after the women have left.
Mikum, it's time for our
tribes to resume exchanging brides.
Lingai's eldest daughter,
Wawa, has just become a woman.
Take her as a bride.
Come back, Dain.
I accept your offer of the bride.
Her husband will be my son Kapan Cook.
Bring her in two days and we'll
give you a bride from our tribe.
I told you to get Wawa to help us
collect shells for her bridal necklace.
I don't know where she is.
Is Wawa, still playing around with Dain?
Something tells me she might be.
Yowayin, watch your daughter.
She's going to the Imedin tomorrow.
She doesn't want to go to the Imedin.
Wawa, where have you been?
What are you doing out here?
Dain. Dain. Dain.
You were alone with him?
I'm not going to the Imedin.
This is not on you.
You're coming with us.
I won't go!
Wawa listen, you are getting married.
I want to choose who I marry.
This is not about you,
it's about all of us.
Do you understand?
Yowayin, I warned you this would happen.
Why haven't you raised her properly?
I need your help now.
I'm speaking from my heart.
Where do these ideas come from?
If you follow your heart, the
Imedin will take revenge.
It will be bad for all of us.
Wawa, we understand you.
We've all experienced
what you're feeling.
My marriage was arranged,
like everyone's was.
I respected my parents and I've
been here a long time.
I've never ever had any regrets.
If you disobey us, your
life will be miserable.
That's settled.
Oh my girl Wawa,
you are going to the Imedin tomorrow.
You must say you agree
with your grandmother.
Go on, shout it out.
Tell us all you agree.
Look at me. Look at me, Wawa.
Agree?
I can't go to the Imedin.
What?
I slept with Dain, and
they won't take me now.
Sit down. I can't believe your stupidity?
Dain! What were you thinking?
Who do you think you are?
Who gave you the right?
I promised Wawa to the Imedin,
and you deliberately broke the agreement.
Very well.
You were the one who was going
to take my place one day.
But you've dishonoured us all.
You must leave.
Go to Yahul.
You're not welcome here anymore.
Now leave!
We don't have to tell the
Imedin what happened.
I know you don't accept
the Chief's decision.
But I want to tell you
how important it is that you do.
Arranged marriage is at the
heart of Kastom.
Without these alliances,
we could not survive.
Here, I want to show you something.
You know Queen Elizabeth
and Prince Philip.
Their marriage was arranged too.
Did they love each other?
They respected their elders decision.
It is true. Look...
Their love gave them children.
His name is Charlie.
But, how do you know they
really loved each other?
Here.
Remember when I went to
their house and met Philip?
I saw with my own eyes
he loved her.
Wawa.
Where is Wawa?
She's gone.
You looked in the gardens?
We've searched everywhere.
She's vanished.
We have to tell Mikum.
Let's have a big family.
How many kids will we have?
About fifty.
Maybe more.
Will the garden be big
enough for all of them?
Yeah,we'll have a huge garden.
Lots of pigs?
More than you can count.
More than a hundred or two hundred.
I'll always look after you.
Good Morning.
You are very welcome.
But I 'd like to know why you are here.
We're in love, but our chefs
won't allow us to be together.
We wanted to ask 
if we might live here.
Sorry, I'm the Chief of this village.
I'm really sorry
I'd like to help, but...
I'd have to seek permission from
your chiefs to avoid any trouble.
We'll go then.
Wait, you've cooked a lot of food.
Eat before you leave.
Listen..
There could be another way.
There's a Christian village around the
bay. They have their service today.
They welcome new people,
and they're not strictl
about Kastom low.
Take my old canoe.
Upon the sacred kava root
we promised to bring your bride today.
I'm ashamed to say she's run away.
I promise that we will findher, and
bring her to you.
You promised her.
You should've watched her.
You should have taken her
when you had the chance.
Sit down. Sit down.
Calm down. Calm down.
Forget the peace. I'll kill you.
You've always killed our people.
How many years now?
We settled this.
Charlie, you have spoken.
Now it's my turn.
We'll kill Dain, and get Wawa.
Go.
Go.
All of you get out.
Gether around everyone.
We can't allow the cycle
of killing to begin again.
We must find Dain and
Wawa before they do.
Lingai and I know the east side
of the island better then anyone.
Get Wawa and warn Dain.
We'll protect the village.
Hey.
Where is Dad and Grandpa?
They've gone to search for
your sister and Dain.
I know where you can look.
I can help.
No, the Imedin are furious,
and want to see blood.
If they see you, they will hurt you.
What are you standing there?
Go home to your mother.
Go!
We could live in the forest.
That's a hard life.
Living with the Christians might be easier.
They've seen us.
Don't be afraid.
They're one of us.
You were led by
sin to live in the wild.
We will clothe you.
Our leader will show you the light.
I had a vision, you were coming.
Come live, and pray with us.
We'll tell your families,
to come and witness your
union before God.
Telling our families is a problem.
They'll never allow us to be together.
Is there another way?
Our God always listens to
our prayers.
I promise you'll be safe.
We are thankful for
your generosity,
but I want to talk about it with Wawa.
You need to join us for God to do His work.
These people freak me out.
Me too. Let's go try the forest.
Hey! Stop stealing my bananas.
I miss Selin.
I wonder what she's doing now.
Why are you thinking about Selin?
She's my sister. I miss her.
You miss your grandfather, don't you?
He banished me.
That part of my life is over.
Now I have you.
Hey! Don't eat it all.
Save some for me.
This honey's the best.
So good.
Life around the volcano is sweet, isn't it?
So sweet.
Imedin warriors.
I know a place to hide on the
other side of the volcano.
The Imedin are on the other
side of the volcano.
Selin. What are you doing here?
The Imedin are on the
other side of volcano.
I saw Wawa and Dain head that way.
Show us.
Wawa, someone's coming.
Take this.
Stay here.
Where's Wawa?
Where's my daughter?
She's safe with me.
Dad, stop!
Stop fighting.
Dain, the Imedin are out to kill you.
I know that.
Go back, and tell them we're dead.
We'll live together in the forest.
You can't hide from Imedin forever.
They will hunt you down. They will kill
my daughter if she stays with you.
I'm not leaving Dain.
Wawa, if you don't go to the Imedin,
there'll be war.
No one will be safe.
The Imedin are out there,
and it will be dark soon.
We'll sleep here, and
tomorrow we'll take Wawa.
to the Imedin.
Your father is right.
You have to go with them.
Dain, we can ask for your
grandfather to take you back.
No. The Imedin won't let
me live, wherever I am.
To live, you have to go with them.
I'm not leaving you.
I'm not leaving you.
They've eaten poisonous mushrooms.
We find Dain and Wawa.
They are dead.
We're bringing them home.
Honoring  Kastom Roads,
I called you here to tell you.
I received a song
from the Spirit Mother.
It touched me deeply.
Since the beginning of time
the chiefs have arranged marriages
along the Kastom Roads
but two lovers chose to
walk a different path.
Now hear their words:
You saw our love was strong.
we showed you how we felt.
you denied us live together.
We had no choice
but to say goodbye forever.
My heart is heavy.
Our precious seedings have been cut down.
We've always fought to keep Kastom strong.
The colonial powers-we rasisted.
The Christians-we rasisted.
The lure of money - 
we resisted that also.
We are the last keepers of
Kastom and we are few.
The young people here
will carry our future.
We must listen to them to keep
Kastom strong.
We have to find a way to make
love marriage part of Kastom.
No more deaths.
Our Kastom burns like that fire.
With every death the fire becomes weaker.
I agree with Charlie about love marriage.
We must embrace every idea
that keeps Kastom burning strong.
Let's add this new log
and unite in peace.
<b>Since the suicide in 1987. the tribes of Tanna have accepted love marriageas as part of their Kastom.</b>
