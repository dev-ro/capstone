The radio won't work!
Why not?
We're getting abnormal interference!
From what? The storm?
It's more like a brain wave.
A brain wave?
How can that interfere with the radio?
What's that?
It's Godzilla!
Change course! Change course!
The interference is gone.
It's gone? How?
Maybe because we're out of its course.
Was Godzilla the cause?
No, the interference came from 7 o'clock.
Seven o'clock?
There's nothing there.
Wait a minute.
Here's a strange island.
- Sollgel Island.
- Sollgel? What's that?
Never heard of it, but look.
Godzilla's headed for that island.
Something must be calling him there.
What could be on Sollgel Island?
Shall we begin?
Go ahead.
Hello. Check party.
Stand by to check capsule two.
HQ listening. Over.
The time is 0836 hours.
Temperature, humidity,
same as at capsule one.
All other systems normal.
Don't be lazy!
It's the old man!
Oh, professor!
Each inspection is very important.
Don't be negligent.
Yes. Yes, sir.
That old man is hard to deal with.
He's not the only thing
that's hard to deal with.
This stupid heat.
I don't know how much more I can take.
Damn it. Again.
He's gone.
This isn't a place for men.
WFPO Sollgel Island
- Did you report an irregularity?
- Yes.
- What's wrong?
- The bearing...
Replace it.
Everything needs to be perfect.
- Why did I come here?
- You volunteered.
Yes, it's a scientific honor...
...to work for
the great Professor Kusumi.
Then don't complain.
But I can't be as sharp as he demands
all the time.
- I miss Japanese food.
- Be patient.
- Interference.
- What? Again?
Locate the source!
Damn it. It's gone!
- Where did it come from?
- About 7 o'clock.
What could be causing the interference?
I have no idea.
What?
- That must be a care package.
- No.
Nobody knows about our plan
other than the WFPO.
Then it's a WFPO plane.
Hello there.
Thanks for coming to meet me.
My luggage is there.
Thanks a lot.
Who are you?
I'm Goro Maki...
...a freelance reporter.
Go home.
- That's ridiculous!
- You're ridiculous.
I'm not moving an inch
until I have a story.
I refuse.
- Do you still insist?
- Yes.
We don't need any publicity.
Who said I was doing this
for your publicity?
I'm working for myself.
The smell of a story...
- The smell of a story?
- Yes.
The smell of a story attracts me.
The readers will decide
whether to read it or not.
I report what I see.
Just like you, professor.
You'd do anything for your research.
Don't be silly.
How about this?
We can't just send him swimming home.
So why don't we have him help us.
We could use another man.
Even having him do the cooking
and cleaning would be a load off of us.
- Wait a minute!
- Would you rather swim home?
Well?
How long do you intend
to wear your life jacket?
You're one of us now.
Cook well.
- What's that sound?
- You'll see.
A huge mantis.
Keep out of the jungle at night!
Mr. Fujisaki!
Did you find the mantis?
- Mantis?
- Yes.
Concentrate on your cooking.
- Any news or fun?
- There's nothing fun here.
Mr. Furukawa's pretty frustrated.
Yeah, he is...
...but everyone's frustrated,
more or less.
Why?
We've been confined
on this eerie island for over a month.
I see. I'd like to hear
some of your eerie stories.
- What's that?
- Vegetables.
- That's the bath!
- I know. Nobody's bathed yet.
Morio was washing those
in there this morning.
Hey.
What are we having tonight?
- Dehydrated vegetables again?
- They've been specially seasoned.
- Feed us some fresh ones.
- Are there fresh vegetables here?
Sure. We call it Sollgel parsley.
There's not a lot left around camp,
but you'll find a lot in the jungle.
The weather conditions
are becoming favorable, sir.
This low pressure here worries me.
It shouldn't be a problem.
The area of high pressure
will push it north.
In other words, tomorrow may be
the perfect day to run our experiment.
Professor?
An experiment to freeze this island?
Wait and see.
- What about the native girl?
- A girl?
There are no natives.
I saw a young girl.
But we've checked thoroughly.
You could've missed her.
- Help her.
- Enough!
Don't interfere with us.
I just want to get this experiment
over with and get out of here!
Professor, is this experiment
so important?
It is.
Mankind's future depends on it.
As you know, the world population
is reaching a limit.
You know why?
The food supply. There won't be
enough food to feed the population.
So we must start thinking
about currently uncultivated lands.
The Siberian tundras, the African
deserts, the South American jungles...
They're useless now.
But if we can control the weather
and make those lands fertile...
...we can avoid mass starvation.
Is that possible?
Theoretically, yes.
That's what we're experimenting.
I have one question.
Why must the experiment
be conducted in secret?
Don't you see?
If someone abused our system,
they could also freeze the entire world.
The results would be the same
as a nuclear holocaust.
We'll conduct the experiment tomorrow.
Everybody, be on standby.
No wind, few clouds.
Temperature 34 degrees Celsius,
humidity 60 percent.
Twenty minutes before launch!
- Five minutes before launch.
- The reporter?
- I thought he was around.
- Alert him.
Two minutes before launch.
Return immediately, Maki.
Hey! Come out!
Come out, quickly! Please!
Thirty seconds before launch!
Ten seconds...
...nine, eight...
...seven, six, five, four, three...
...two, one. Launch.
Launch freezing balloon.
Refrigeration gas,
negative 115 degrees Celsius.
The balloon's altitude, 350 meters.
Four hundred.
- Detonate it at 800.
- Five hundred.
Six hundred.
Six hundred fifty.
Seven hundred.
Seven hundred fifty.
- Eight hundred.
- Detonate.
Warm air is ascending, sir.
Capsules, standby.
Release silver iodide.
Damn it!
The temperature has descended
to 29 degrees Celsius.
So far, so good.
Just as we calculated.
- Has Maki returned?
- He'll come back shivering.
Temperature falling rapidly.
It's currently at 25 degrees Celsius.
Stop cooling. Stand by for heating.
Launch the radioactive balloon.
The radio controls aren't responding.
Professor!
- We can't control the capsules!
- What's the cause? The cause?
We're getting interference.
- Can we get the balloon back?
- No, sir.
If it explodes too soon...
We'll get a reverse reaction.
The upper atmosphere
will work like a convex lens.
- Are the controls working now?
- No good.
Thus, sunlight converged
on Sollgel Island.
The temperature rose
to 70 degrees Celsius.
Then came the thunderstorms.
Hot rain came in torrents.
Four days later, it finally cooled
to 37 degrees Celsius.
Tell all the men...
- At last, it cooled a little.
- We were nearly baked.
- So the experiment is over.
- I don't think so.
I know the old man well.
He's encouraged by hardships.
Everyone, over here!
A message from the professor.
We are to do a systems check
and damage reports immediately.
Is the experiment still on?
He didn't say.
He only ordered a systems check.
- At the inlet down there.
- What?
A girl was swimming.
With that heat, she's sure to be dead now.
Don't you believe me?
You might have been hallucinating.
Professor!
Professor, how did it get that big?
Maybe because of the heat
and radioactivity.
Let's go back.
Damn it.
Capsule one is over there.
We'll call for help from there.
It's out!
Get inside.
Professor!
Professor, what are they doing?
The interference waves we got
came from over there.
An egg!
According to the reports,
we can finish the repairs in 10 days.
- In addition...
- I object! I object.
We can't continue...
Who are opposed?
Professor, you should
continue your research.
You have no say.
You're not a member of this team!
You must be kidding me.
I was admitted as a cook.
Hold it. Fighting won't do any good.
Furukawa, we can't get off this island.
The heat ruined our radio.
We can't even call for a rescue ship.
How soon can you fix it?
I'm not sure yet,
but it could take a while.
Continue the repairs in the morning.
Meeting adjourned.
You're pretty good.
- I know you broke the radio.
- Well...
- The kitchen!
- What's happening?
- What is it?
- My shirt is gone.
Something's on a tree.
Light the tree behind me.
No!
You saw her, didn't you?
That's the girl I saw.
I'm impressed that she's still alive.
Kamacuras?
The mutant mantis.
Maki named them last night.
Journalists are good at naming things.
Morio, what kind of egg
do you think that is?
I have no idea.
It's being cracked!
It broke open!
A baby Godzilla!
What an unfair fight!
Watch out!
- What's going on?
- He insists on going home.
Furukawa, have you gone mad?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
It's Godzilla!
Come on!
Everybody, run!
Godzilla is coming!
Quick! Over there!
- Godzilla's come to help!
- Wait a minute.
The radio interference was the baby's cry.
All right!
No time to cheer. Let's get out
of here before we get hurt.
That way!
Over here. Come on.
This will pep you up.
It's you.
- You thief.
- Thief?
Are you Japanese?
- But I'm not a thief.
- You're stealing my things!
You're the thief.
This is my shirt.
You lie! Boys don't wear red shirts
like this. Or are you a girl?
I'm a boy. My name's Goro.
And yours?
Saeko.
Saeko, huh?
I'm with the scientists.
I'm not a thief.
I'm not a thief either. Here.
- You can keep it.
- Really?
You'll really give it to me?
But what are you doing on an island,
all alone like this?
The radio's really out of order this time.
Well, let's check the other equipment.
Listen, everybody.
From now on...
The reporter! Are you all right?
We were worried.
Sorry.
Professor, I want you to meet someone.
Come on.
This is Ms. Saeko Matsumiya.
Matsumiya?
Take a look at this.
Her father was an archaeologist.
"1955, Sollgel Island,
Tadashi Matsumiya."
- Matsumiya?
- Do you know him?
No. But 20 years ago, when the
Japanese pulled out of the Pacific...
...there was an archaeologist who
stayed behind on one of the islands.
That's right.
It was Dr. Matsumiya.
He died on this island seven years ago.
And your mother?
She died when I was born.
Oh, I see.
Well, you've done very well alone here.
It's Kamacuras!
Hurry up! lt'll ruin the equipment.
- You've got to head it off.
- Right!
This way!
All right, it's gone.
It's too dangerous to stay here.
How about this?
Why don't we move
the equipment into her cave.
- A cave?
- Yes.
It's safer and cooler than here.
That's how she survived that intense heat.
All right, let's go.
- Right.
- Hurry up.
Goro, you gave up!
And you call yourself a man.
What do you mean?
There's not a man in Tokyo
who can run faster than you.
Tokyo? What kind of place is it?
What kind of place?
Well, it's a man-made jungle.
Jungle?
- Goro, are you going back there?
- Yeah.
- You'll come too.
- Really?
- It was your father's home.
- Oh, wonderful!
Saeko! It's Godzilla!
It's all right. He's only a baby.
We're friends.
Hey, come back!
It's really harmless.
See?
Saeko! It's the big one!
Fujisaki.
What's a Kumonga?
Kumonga?
I'm reading Matsumiya's notes
and that name keeps popping up.
Kumonga?
I have absolutely no idea.
Morio.
I feel so hot.
My body is burning up!
Professor, he's got a high fever.
Everybody's got it. They're outside.
- Tashiro, what's the matter?
- I'm hot.
Furukawa, what happened?
- They've all got a high fever.
- Let's get them inside.
All right, come on.
We're all out of medicine.
It's some kind of tropical disease.
What do we do?
We may get it too.
I know something to make them better.
- What is it?
- The warm, red water.
- Warm, red water?
- Yes.
If you drink it, the fever will go away.
- All right, I'll go get it.
- You can't.
That's where Godzilla is.
And on the way, you must pass
Kumonga's valley.
Saeko, just what is this "Kumonga"?
It's a giant spider.
Godzilla and his baby, Kamacuras
and now Kumonga.
This is a monster island.
But Kumonga is sleeping now.
If we don't wake him up,
we won't have any trouble.
I'll leave now.
Wait.
You can't go out there alone.
- Don't worry.
- I'll go with you.
Goro.
According to
Dr. Matsumiya's notes...
...the web of the Kumonga
can only be cut by heat.
By heat?
- It's a good thing to know.
- I understand.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Goro. Take a gun with you.
Be careful.
This is where Kumonga lives.
Where Kumonga lives?
- Well, where is it?
- Underground, sleeping.
Be careful!
This is going to be dangerous.
Damn it, he knows we're here.
No, he's educating his son.
He's educating it?
Just like the education fanatics in Japan.
What's that?
They don't let their children play.
Poor kids.
Perhaps.
The baby spit fire?
Yes, it's growing really fast.
Furukawa!
- Watch out!
- I'm going home!
Stop it!
Give me the gun!
Professor, are you all right?
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
I'll get you herbs tomorrow.
Thank you.
Fujisaki, you'd better repair
the radio soon.
Professor, you mean...?
With things the way they are now,
we must give up the experiment.
The red water was really effective.
Everyone is cured.
They're still a little woozy,
but their fevers are gone.
That's good.
How is Furukawa?
Well, he regrets what he did.
Where's Saeko?
She went to get herbs for me.
Saeko!
Saeko! Come on!
Let's run for it.
Let's go.
- It's Kumonga!
- Come on!
That's it!
Between those rocks!
Saeko, climb up!
Quietly.
Oh, it's the professor.
What are you doing, sir?
Oh, you two.
Changing the melted cords,
but it's very hard.
You haven't give up, have you?
Would you just loaf if there were no news?
No, I'd have to do something.
It's the same with me.
We have a poor nature.
Lie down and hide!
Is that Kumonga?
That was close.
Dinner will be ready soon.
Oh, good.
- Everyone, come quick!
- What's wrong?
- We can't get out.
- What?
Kumonga's outside spinning a web!
Has it given up, professor?
No, it's waiting for us to come out.
It's fixed! The radio is repaired!
Send an S.O.S.
- We can't.
- Why not?
We have to put the antenna outside.
Damn it!
We can go out.
- Really?
- Yes.
This tunnel opens to the sea.
We can swim outside.
So that's how you disappeared that time.
- I'll go.
- Me too.
All right.
Look.
Let's hurry.
- Keep away!
- Go back!
Come on.
Watch out.
Look out, Morio!
Move over there. Quickly.
Morio, be careful!
- What's going on?
- It's bad.
Kumonga and Godzilla's son are fighting!
If the father comes,
this cave will be crushed!
Let's start the experiment.
- We can't move anyway.
- But...
Let's freeze the monsters.
All right?
But will it work?
Let's hope so.
We still have enough material left.
We made contact.
A rescue ship has been sent to us.
How about the experiment?
Let's do it.
All of you, will you do it?
Hurry to your posts.
All right, let's get started.
What should we do?
Let's get the lifeboat ready.
Now, one, two, three!
Freezing unit ready to go.
Electric generators standing by.
How is the weather?
We can't wait around,
but it doesn't look too bad.
Starting the countdown.
Minus 180 seconds.
Sixty seconds.
Minus 10 seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six...
...five, four, three...
...two, one.
Launch the refrigeration balloon.
Five hundred, 550.
Six hundred.
Six-fifty.
Seven hundred.
Detonate the unit.
Release silver iodide.
Ready the radioactive unit.
Launch.
- Interference.
- Not again.
- How's the remote control working?
- No trouble yet.
The interference is gone.
Either Godzilla's given up or he's
been killed by the other monsters.
- Detonate capsule at 1000 meters.
- Roger.
- Altitude?
- Six hundred fifty.
Seven hundred.
It's at 900.
Nine hundred fifty.
One thousand.
All right, detonate!
Saeko, look.
It seems to be a success.
The temperature has fallen
three degrees Celsius.
No, five degrees.
It's going down fast.
We've done it.
Professor!
The monsters have moved away.
That means we can leave!
The temperature
is negative 5 degrees Celsius.
- Switch to automatic control.
- Roger.
All right, let's get to the beach.
Hurry!
Hey, it's snowing!
It's snow!
Professor...
Professor!
All right, let's move on out.
Poor Godzilla.
They won't die.
They'll just hibernate.
Hibernate?
They'll sleep until the snow melts.
Anybody see the ship?
Hey, what's that?
It's coming this way!
Hey, it's the ship!
Why didn't they tell us
they were sending a submarine?
They scared me half to death!
They'll live peacefully
after the snow melts.
Let's go inside.
Goodbye.
