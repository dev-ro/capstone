DOPPELGANGER
Good evening, the miss Gooding.
- Good evening. - Watch your step.
No! You don't understand!
If she marries that shrink,
our share of the fund will be
legally turn over to her.
There are other ways
of dealing with the...
No! You are wrong!
The shrink will have the
state auditied.
And the auditors will wonder
where all of the money went.
I know. I'm her mother,
thank you very much.
Michael...
It's us or her.
The little bitch is gotta disappear!
She's back. I gotta go.
Holly? Sweet? I am comming,
honey! Comming!
Holly, where you've been?
Holly! Holly, what's wrong?
Holly, what's happening?
No!!!
Los Angeles
We arrived.
Angel's Court
Sorry. I know it's not convenience
But can you wait here for a second?
Sure. That's not problem.- Thanks.
Do you know you where Patrick lives?
- Right through there.
I know I'm late with the rent. The thing is
I've gotta cheque's comming in two days.
...three weeks ago...
Please...
I gotta go. You'll get the money
in two days, I sware.
I'll just take everything I own.
Alright?
I know that much.
Thank you. Butthead!
Hi! You are Patrick, right?
- Yeah. I am Patrick.
And you are...?
- Holly Gooding.
I saw your add in paper and
I am sorry I did't call. Just...
I thought if you'd mind to look around?
- No, not at all.
Please, come in. Sorry, it's a little messy.
I am a writer, you know.
The writers drive to anarchy.
Please, please...
Just right back there...
The add in papers says two bedrooms.
I only see one.
Two bedrooms?
That is funny...
The thing about that is that
I have strange schedule.
I get ideas in day time
and write at night.
And I take quick naps on that...
over there at desk.
And I never really use bedroom actually.
So I just figure out someone
else may use it so...
And there's only one bathroom?
The thing about that is I only have
a razor and toothbrush.
You have all that space in there.
Do you spend much time at home?
- Yes. Yes and no. I write at home,
but at night do research.
So, I'm not much inside.
That's good. Cause I
spend time at home.
Another thing, there
is a lot cargo space.
Is it your cat?
- Cat? That's Nathan.
Nathan is great.
Great cat. Very talented.
He makes his own clothes.
If you got a problem with these
it's most outside cat.
Sometimes stays.
You'll hard ever see her.
Is it a earthquake? - No. Truck its on his way
to construction site down the street.
It happens once a week,
and almost finished. So...
It's really a very quiet neighborhood.
- I came from L. A. and
I've always had nightmares: about big
earthquake and L.A. falling right into ocean.
How much do you say for month?
- The price is $420 in month.
But if that is too much for you,
I can definitely low it down.
No, that's fine.
Unless you mind rooming with
the woman? - I don't mind. Of course not.
We live in 90's. Everything is-great.
People are people, you know?
When would you like to move in?
- My suitcase is in the cab.
Nathan, don't just sit there.
Set the table.
I hope you like Chicken Highsmith.
It's an old family recipe. Nathan?
You're ok? - Yeah.
- Alright.
How do you feal? You jet flight?
- No. I'm fine. Can I help?
No. Almost done.
Well, I can make the salad.
I can't cook, but I can cut.
Oh, this has never been better.
This is perfect.
No! No, please don't!
Please!
No! Don't!
No! No, please don't!
Did you sell the house at Moonholland?
- You know I did.
Maybe you should show them
place on Laurel?
I couldn't write this
kind of dialogs if I try.
I think I'm gonna change the vampire
lovers into the real state agents.
That's great! What?
- Patrick, what's the matter with you?
You look like shit. What's up?
- I'm sorry. I haven't much sleep last night.
I gotta new roommate.
- So.
What, the guy snorks louder
then you, or what? - No, it's a girl.
It's a girl? - It's different.
- Different? How?
Different then who?
Elly, it's not what you're thinking.
- How is she different. Why is she different?
What does she do?
- I dont' know. I didn't ask her.
Patrick, you take this woman into your
apartment and don't even know what she does?
What is the matter with you?
I know you only think with your
dick, but this is ridiculous!
Now you are too tired to write.
Patrick, I want you. I've always wanted
you. Take me right here on the table.
I'm waiting for you, baby...
Right. - What are
you looking at?
Her. It's her.
- How old is she? 12?
No she's not really young.
Yeah, how young?
Jail bail young? - No.
No, she's old enough to order
beer if she wants to.
This is really weird.
How did she get here so fast. She was sleeping
when I left the house this morning.
Maybe you woke up here when
you slammed the door?
I did not slam the door!
You always slam the door.
- Do not! You do!
To to unlock press anger inside you.
I'm very consider about you, Patrick.
You never take off your hat.
Maybe you should call Mike,
find some prostitute...
Yeah, a lot of good therapy did
it to you, Elly. - Shut up!
Hey, call your therapist, Mikey.
That's pretty ally.
Why don't you invite your new
chiquita-banana to join us?
Sure she followed you here.
- She's not my girlfriend, OK?
And I don't have any idea
why she followed me.
You know, I think I'm gonna ask her...
before we fight.
Holly! Come here over
for breakfast!
Sorry, I didn't think about it before.
I didn't want to wake you up!
Holly?
So, visits are when?
Weekends and work days?
I am a relative. So,
how is he doing?
Ok. Thank you very much.
Bye, bye.
Hi! How are you? - I've never seen this
place so clean in my entire live. Thank you.
Next week, I'll do the cleaning.
You don't have to. I like sort
of housework anyway.
And you're out off detergent.
I've been meaning of buy some.
You probably didn't hear me when
I called you. - Called me, when?
About an hour ago. St.Monica and
Kings Road. I had breakfast with the friend.
And I saw you across the street.
I called if you wanna come join us, but...
Haven't been on St.Monica bulevar
and haven't left the house all day.
Really? My mistake.
The girl I saw, just like you.
Same cloth and everything...
No, no, no. It can't be!
Sorry, I have really lousy eyesight.
You know, it's writers affliction.
Bad memory for people names too.
Are you Ok?
- Just stop touch me!
Alright...I didn't mean to.
Sorry I upset you.
Look, it's not your fault, ok?
I have to call New York. And...
I'll pay for it. Ok?
- No problem, no problem.
I'll just go to have your privacy now.
I'll go buy some detergent.
This is Dr. Heller. I'm not by the
phone right now. 
But if you leave your name and number
I'll call you back as soon as posible.
Thank you.
Dr.Heller. Hi, it's me, Holly.
Listen...She's back. She's back in L.A.
I don't know what she wants now.
Sorry, I scared you.
- It's Ok.
What do you writing?
- I'm...the same screenplay.
I can't get it right.
I'm trying write "Breakfast at Tiffany's"
as a horror move.
Probably not good idea.
Can I read some?
If you want to read something decent,
it's pretty much in.
National short story
Contest winner
Patrick Highsmith
Page 39.
I was still on college.
I entered in with short story
competition and won 1st prize.
I thought it's gonna be that
easy from then on. Shit.
All I was is second... Truman Capote.
It's very good. You are
very talented.
It's very romantic.
- Well, sort of romantic.
Listen, I am really sorry that
I yelled at you before.
Please say that you forgive me, because
I can't handle anybody being angry of me.
I forgive you.
Well I guess its from time to time.
This is unsettling city, you know.
I left St. Paul because I thought
that city was - too silent.
Do you have car? - Yeah.
It's not a great car.
But it's car.
Well, I'm gonna see the old house
that I lived in before he moved.
Tomorrow morning at 12.
I'm meeting Mr Wallace,
who's our family lawyer.
An old friend of my father and...
I just wondering if you'd drive me.
I mean, I'll pay you
for your time.
That is - if you have time
- I have time.
Ok. Great.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Caps after you or something?
- Why do you think that?
I am kidding.
I got it. Cops...very funy.
What did you say?
Holly, we should go. We'll be late.
You should give me your purse.
Look, I am not a piece of meat!
You wouldn't want someone
bandy to your sister, would you?
My sister wouldn't dress like you.
Like you're begging for this.
Ok, I understand.
You bitch, I'll kill you!
- I'd like to see you try it!
Holly. Hi. How are you?
This is my friend Patrick Highsmith.
This is Mr.Wallace.
Nice to meet you. What's with the
"Mr. Wallace"  - Michael, right?
Just like old times.
You know, its really good to see you.
You've been getting your monthly
cheques, right? - Yeah.
I was little surprised, when you
asked me the keys.
The house has been sealed for 4 years.
And I thought that...
I know. I just really wanted
to look inside and look around.
Do you want me to come in
with you? - No. Thank you.
Then how about dinner later,
tonight? - Some other time.
No problem.
You call.
Right from a Bette Davis movie.
Where do your parents live now?
- They are both dead.
I'm sorry.
Someone live here?
Caretaker or something?
No, why?
I saw someone on window up there.
Do you need help with that lock?
- You know what? Let's go back.
Come on, we've just get here. - Seriously,
I'm really hungry
and I really wanna get something
to eat so, we'll go. I'll buy it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
This wind is incredible.
- Yeah, pretty spooky, ha?
"St.Ana" always makes me feel like
its the end of the world or something.
I like it. Its very musical
and exciting.
Your nose is bleeding.
- No, its for dry air.
I used to it. It happens
to me all the time.
People think its scary, but
Its natural thing.
Would you like some tea, or...?
- No, thank you. - Sure?
Its just the toast. Would you like
"Toast Highsmith"?
What is the "Toast Highsmith"?
It is mustard and great jelly on toast.
Its for die for!
I really want to thank you for giving me
a ride today. You are a good guy.
Don't say that, please.
Everything, but not that.
Ok. You are a good writer
and a good guy.
Also very kind.
I'm not that kind. Really.
Curse Nathan. This is not a jungle.
I feed you enough food.
Good morning.
- Morning.
What are you doing?
- Just looking.
- Neat.
- Do you know what?
This is thing is very personal tome.
Never let anyone touch it.
My father gave it to me
when I was very little.
Ok, no problem.
Who's he?
- My brother Fred.
He's cute, doesn't he?
- Just like his sister.
That's one of reasons why I
came here - to visit him.
What happened to your hand? - Last night
things gone lot off hand, upon intended.
What do you mean things gone off hand?
- Last night we were great together.
What do you mean we were great
together? We didn't do anything you and I.
You and her can do all
dirty things you want to.
But I don't want to hear about it. Ok?
And don't confuse me with her. She may
looks like me, but she is not me.
She looks like you, but,...
She's mine doppelganger.
Do you know what that is?
You don't believe me, do you?
You think I'm weird. Well, I'm not.
You yourself said you
saw her yesterday, twice...
You can ask Dr.Heller. He believes me. He's
psychiatrist in. N.Y. with Yale medical school.
If just happen to see
her again, be carefull.
Because she's very dangerous
and capable for everything.
So, watch out.
One of the vapires is white female.
The other vampire black male.
The irrational body cap,
vampires, love story. It's great.
Elly, do you speak German?
- Patrick, you know I do.
Patrick, do you even remember
anything about me.
What does doppelganger mean?
Patrick, it's a great idea.
Congratulations.
You had a first good one of the year.
It's great high concept. We'll gonna make
zillion dollars on.
It's hit. It's now. It's happens.
Here we go...
"Doppelganger", the ghostly double
of the living person,
that hunts its flesh and
blood care apart. Cool.
What does it say? It's a ghost?
- Kind of. Sort of.
You know who knows about
this stuffs? Sister Jan.
Remember woman that
I used work for?
Jan? Oh, the lady that runs
"Phone Sex Operation"?
Why would she know anything
about doppelgangers?
Patrick, she used to be a nun.
She taught catholic school.
Why do you think they
call her sister Jan?
I don't know. I thought it was some
sort of feministic "dude".
Patrick, that is so
incredibly not funny.
Come on, put some words on paper.
We're fucking around with this
idiotic story for 4 months.
Maybe we are not getting anywhere
cause we're not talented.
Maybe we suck. You know,
that is possibility.
Maybe we just write another piece
of crap that's not gonna...
Patrick, are you in love with
psycho-slither, or what?
Jesus, here goes the neighbour.
- Hey, Elizabeth! - Hey, asshole!
When talking about psycho-slithers,...
who is he pumping now?
That's Larry Spaulding.
Mr. Disease of Week,
Dick time, The Looser.
The guy is richer then God, Patrick.
You know Ellie, why don't
I leave you alone? - Sit down!
Don't you fucking dare!
Don't even think about it!
Hi, Rob!
- How are you doing, Elizabeth?
Good! - You look fantastic!
Oh, really?
Thank you.
I told Larry what writer you are.
Really?
- Yeah.
He's making party down the house tonight. I was
figuring out that you might want...
Patrick and I would love to go get
friendly with the man with the cheque book.
And I think you and Larry
will get along beautifully.
I don't know if would Larry
and me... - Shut up!
What time?
No!
Please, don't!
- What's wrong?
I'm sorry I scared you.
I know you are a little jumpy
with my situation...
but it's my problem and it's
something I have to deal with.
I shouldn't even told you.
Look, if you want me to just go,
why don't you just say so?
And I'll leave. And you can keep the
money that I've already payed you.
Are you hungry? There's not
much in the fridge, but...
I can order up. Italian or Chinese?
My treat.
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.
Have a headache.
I thought my nap
make it go away.
I am sorry. I have prescription meds, and
it's really safe, if you wanna take some.
No, thanks. I'll be fine.
Listen, can I ask you
a favor as a friend?
We are friend, aren't we?
- Sure, we're friends.
Listen, I wanna go see my brother
Fred tomorrow at Institute.
I haven't seen him in 4 years and I would
really like it if you come with me.
He is in mental Institution and
I'm little scared of those places.
Tomorrow? I've got a meeting.
Please, I'll pay you. It will
just really do lot to me.
I guess, I can cancel a meeting.
I'll go with you.
No charge. - Great. And I'm
still gonna pay gas, ok?
Yeah, whatever.
Oh, I'm gonna be late. I
gotta jump in shower.
Where are you going? - I'm going
on producers party.
It's gonna be really dull, sort of.
I have to go now.
In what time are you going? - Nine.
Would you like to go?
I've read your new script.
I love it.
Actually, Patrick and I have new script
that we would love to talk to you about.
Ellie, I really don't like to
talk about business to the party.
But, if you're interested in art, my most
valuable pieces are on the 2nd floor
on the master bedroom.  If you'd like.
And I won't bite. I mean, not hard.
Look, there's Patrick.
Excuse me.
Want some caviar?
- No, thanks.
Yeah, I hate this stuff.
Elizabeth, this is Holly. - Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
Nice crowd. Fell like peeing
in punch ball.
Patrick. Disgusting.
- Sorry.
Elizabeth! My God, you look like
playmate or something. - Thank you.
You look fantastic! - Really?
Hey, how are you doing, Patrick?
- Pretty good.
So, what are you gonna do with your
girlfriend, dancing or something?
She's not my girlfriend.
- Room-mate. - A room-mate.
Holly, this is Rob. - Hi, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Nice room-mate have you, partner.
- Yeah, thank you.
Listen, Ellie, I think that Larry
is got thing for you, over there and...
I don't want pressure anything, but
I really think you should get know him
better, cause he could be very...
- Sleezy! Like you. Excuse me.
Patrick, lets you and I dance.
- No, no, later. - Come on.
Lets dance, would you? Come on.
I'll dance with you if you
promise not to lay a hand on me or
I'm gonna break your face.
Ellie, please. Come on. Room-mate will
make a wrong idea about me. Come on.
You know, that
He's nobody. He's boring.
His room-mate's boring.
His fucking dog's boring.
Cat, actually.
If you don't take your hand
of my butt, I'll snap it off.
She's very nice, Elizabeth.
- Yeah, she's great. A good friend.
This is fun.
- Yeah.
Do you think that we should dance?
- I really don't dance much. I just watch.
Come on. Come on. - Ok.
One dance. That's it.
I'll go for a drink.
Want one?
- No, thanks.
Great dancing.
Is that your girlfriend?
- No. She's my room-mate.
Ah, lucky guy. I am
Richard Wolf. How do you do?
Patrick Highsmith.
Patrick Highsmith. You're kidding.
A writer?
How do you know I'm a writer?
- Well, I'm a producer...
I've got a picture that's about to go,
and I need rewrite.
Friend of yours gave me your name.
Oh, really? Who is that friend?
If you want to give me a call, here is phone
number. Give me a call. I wanna talk to you.
Holy shit, Larry. Look at the room-mate!
Jesus! - What's going on?
- Holly? Are you ok?
I feel so... - You alright?
It's ok. Alright. I'm here.
It's only little wine of here.
Sit here...
Seems like a nice place.
It's little hard. We were really
close before the killing...
Who did he kill? - I don't
think he did it.
I know he didn't do it.
He just - he woudn't...
Whom was he accused for killing?
- My father.
Fred stayed in L.A., because we
grew up here. Some family!
Sometimes I think that's some
little family curse.
Why they think that Fred did it?
How did it happen?
I don't know why.
One night I was off my badroom and
I heard Fred and my father arguing.
And I came down and
my father hit Fred.
My father was very strict.
And I knew that it wasn't Fred.
I knew that was the other one.
Anyway, he pushed my father
out off the window.
And ...
My house was on a hill.
He rolled down.
They never found the body, just blood.
Wait. How was old Fred
when this happened?
I was 14. So he was 11.
An 11 old year boy threw a grown man
out of window?
Sounds strange, doesn't it? - Yeah.
I knew that it wasn't him.
But I didn't know about
Doppelgangers about that time.
I told my mother and the police
everything that I saw.
At least I thought I saw.
But, Fred...he knows.
- He knows - what?
Fred? It's me, Holly.
Is he doing ok?
He ain't talking for 4 years.
So, who knows?
Look, I need a telephone. Could
you show me where phone is?
We can leave them alone together.
She'll be ok. - No. I don't know.
No, I'm not suppose to...- I 'll be fine.
Let's go. - Alright.
I'm giving 10 minutes alone.
If anything goes wrong,
hit that button on the right.
Nothing will go wrong.
Fred, I know it wasn't you.
I know about the other.
Fred, please, talk to me.
Same thing is happening to me.
Mr.Highsmith, this is Stanley White,
your new neighbour.
I just moved today to
apartment 6 and
U.P.S. left package here for you.
I'll be at home all evening.
Come any time.
Package for me?
Holly, I'm going to apartment 6 to pick
something up. I'll be right back, alright?
Did that guy Wolf ever call you?
- No. He didn't. Richard Wolf.
Maybe he sent that screenplay
over. I'll be right back.
Mr White? Hi, I'm
Patrick Highsmith...
My name is Stanley White.
I'm special agent within F.B.I.
F.B.I? What do you want?
- Is Holly Gooding living with you?
Yeah. She's living with me.
She's room-mate.
A tenant...I'm running a...
- That's illegal.
Wait, can we work on something else?
- Are you doing her?
What? - Are you fucking her?
It's all personal, don't you think?
Maybe, it is.
Did you realize that your
girlfriend is prime suspect
in the murder of her mother?
For murder of her mother?
About 6 months ago in N.Y.,
people saw her entered the building.
Go up with the elevator and
knock on the mothers door.
A little later her mother was dead.
There's noone else in apartment
except od two of them.
That's an opening shut case.
Right? Wrong!
She came with some weird mambo-jambo
bullshit alibying guard off.
Now we know she did it!
But she walked.
Look I don't anything about this..
I'm gonna ...
I'm not finished, asshole!
- Alright.
Did she say anything that might indicates
why she's here? Anything at all.
She's here, she said to put her
family state in order and
also to see her brother Fred.
Her brother, Fred...
We know he's crazy. - Yeah.
So, now she's after him.
Wait a minute...She's after her brother?
See, the father left trust fondation,
equaly monthly cheque to the
mother, son and the daughter.
If only one relationship revives,
the winner takes all.
We talk about big bux here.
6-7 millions. - Holly shit!
So, now that the mother is gone,
we think...
No, we know - she's after the brother.
She didn't make you any offers, did she?
- What do you mean, offers?
You know - a deal.
You scratch my back,
I'll lick your balls.
You know?
- No, she did not.
You aren't thinking about
hold off me, are you?
Cause, anything happens
to her brother
and you are 1st in the
line for complicity.
This is bullshit! I know
she loves her brother.
I was there today,
she hasn't seen him 4 years.
Nobody is so good as an actors.
No, but she is crazy, too.
Or to be more precise, she is suffering
from this multiple-personality thing.
She can be different people,
in different times.
Trust me, she has killed before,
and she will kill again.
What am I suppose to do?
What do you want me to do?
I'm not allowed to give
you legal advice, but,
if I were you, I will get a fuck
away from her, if I asked.
Out.
Do you want some more
bread? - No, I'm fine.
Tell me - you don't like it, ha?
I can take it.
No, it's good...I'm just a...
On second thought,
I'll have another piece.
Are you sure that nothing else
is wrong? Something eems its woring you.
No. I'm just...upset that
producer didn't call. That's all.
Don't worry. He'll call.
You gotta have faith in yourself.
Specially, when you're down. Even
if other people are down to you.
You are good, Patrick.
And if you're really good,
always that never blame yourself
for misfortunes that are comming away.
Did you blame yourself
when your parents died?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to upset you.
It's ok. You didn't.
The answer for your question is: Yes,
I did blame myself when my father died.
My mother and I moved to New York.
That's when I started to
see Dr. Heller,
because I needed help.
Then, when she died,
I felt guilty again.
But, I knew I was good. Anyway
there wasn't to blame.
How did your mother die?
- She was murdered.
Did they catch who did it?
No. Do you know who
prime suspect was?
They thought that I killed
my owned mother.
I'm full.
You know what? You've got
a rough day.
I think I'll sleep out with my friend.
- Wait, Patrick.
Don't go, please!
I don't know about a lot
of things what's going on.
I don't know anything about it, okey?
I can't help you. - You are
helping me. Thank you.
Dont' thank me. Just
let me go. - No!
Please, stay with me.
And be with me.
No, no. That's not a good idea.
You are under a strain.
You'll just say that wasn't
you in the morning.
I won't. I feel really
comfortable with you...
I want this.
Holly, I really like you.
- I like you too.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
Looking at you. Thinking.
Thinking about of what?
- Last night.
Are you Ok about
last night?
Last night was great.
What? Was only you and me, right?
Comming!
Who is it? - Gas man.
One of your neighbours reported leak.
We've just taken precautions.
Do you mind if I check your kitchen?
Not at all. Right in there.
- Thanks.
It is somewhere...
- I'll go myself out.
Have a good day. - You too.
Hello, is Patrick Highsmith there?
Yes, this is Patrick.
This is Richard Wolf.
Mr. Wolf?
Richard, how are you?
- Listen, can we talk?
Listen, I wanna meet you somewhere.
I fired this writer and I need rewrite.
You can start right away, as soon as
we have the story in place. Is that Ok?
That's great! Great!
Acceptable?
I mean, I'm sorry for
the other guy.
Where would you like to meet?
Anywhere. You name it.
Let's be Caffee "Victor". Do
you know where it is?
Oh, yes. I had breakfast
there last week.
Shall we see at ten? I'll be a
little late, but wait for me. Ok, kid?
Ten o'clock? Sure thing.
Something else.
I work with the writing partner.
She's very good.
Can I bring her along?
Ellie, you didn't say a word
for last 30 seconds. - Really?
You have new record in timing.
Do you want me to top?
Are you cold? - I'm fine.
Alright.
Hello, my name is Holly Gooding.
My brother Fred is a patient here.
And I need to see him for a second. I'm
leaving in N.Y in the morning in 7a.m.
I'm sorry, Miss, it's impossible.
The visiting hours...
I know when visiting hours are.  But
I really need to see him. It's important.
I'm sorry, Miss, I can't.
Put your money away, Miss Gooding.
You have to come back tomorrow.
I see. Well, at least I know
Fred is in good hands.
Thank you.
It's time for my rounds.
I'll be back in two minutes.
Would you watch the phone,
for me, please. - Ok.
Thanks.
Oh, my God! How
did she do this?
Call the police, right away!
This is someone's idea, but joke.
It's not funny.
Do you have call for me?
Patrick Highsmith?
I don't think so. Let
me check. - Thanks.
Patrick, are you sure you told guy
the right place and the right time?
I am sure...I am sure.
I'm going around and mad me.
I know - you're Mr.Reliable,
Mr.Responsibility, but
maybe you talk to your evil twins...
- Doppelganger.
Double twin thing.
I'm sorry. Nobody called for you.
Close the door.
We can lock them.
Your placement?
- Over there. I live here.
That's Patrick Highsmith.
Wait a minute...
- I live here!
Hey! I didn't do it! What are
you doing to me? I didn't do...
Take your hands off me!
I didn't do it!
Patrick! - What is going on here?
Who the hell are you?!
- I didn't do it!
Patrick Highsmith. I live here.
Detective Pouget, Homicide Division.
I'm in charge here.
I need you to answer the
questions, if you don't mind?
Stop! Back off me! - What's
going on? What happened?
Fred Gooding, the brother of Miss Gooding
here, was stubbed by Miss Gooding.
Jesus. - Look, if you're too
upset to talk to now,
come to my office tomorrow morning.
Patrick, tell them that
it wasn't me.
What are you going to do her?
- Come down.
There's no way she attacked
her brother.
Where are you taking me?
What do you want?
Daddy? Daddy?
No. It can't be!
Daddy don't!
Please, don't hurt me!
Holly! Wake up!
You were dreaming.
It's me Dr.Heller.
I flew up as soon as Mr.Wallace called.
You're gonna be Ok.
And Fred? - Fred is alright.
He's gonna pull through.
I just spoke to the chief surgeon.
The knife didn't harm any artery.
I didn't do it. I swear
I didn't do it.
I know you didn't.
It's her.
I'm gonna stop her. I'm gonna
stop her, even if I have to kill her.
Holly, you just need
to get some rest.
Dr. Heller?  - You shouldn't go away.
There's guy here, Patrick Highsmith.
He brought her clothes.
You must be Patrick. I'm
Dr.Heller, Holly's doctor.
Do the police think she did it?
Yes, they do.
But, they don't really have a case.
There are no witnesses, no evidences.
I spoke with her family lawer,
and believes that Holly will be
released within next couple of days.
Hold him down!
Hold him down!
Do you think could this be a...
- A doppelganger? - Yeah.
She said you told her that
thing acctually exists.
Patrick, you've been a very
good friend to Holly.
And I'm sure you feel for her.
You have to understand an extraordinary
situation you've stumbled into.
A most people don't understand MPD's.
Multy Personality Disorders.
They serve as kind of safety down,
an escape patch.
A way of dealing with
the very ugly reality.
Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah, please.
Bit dangerous thing about these people
suffering from MPDs is
they tap into deepest, darkest
most prime rigid of mind.
Fear, anger, hatred...Cream?
- No. Sugar.
So, whats what? - I don't know.
They think she did it.
Of course she do.
What, are you stupid?
Look, Ennie. They haven't found weapon.
Its nothing conclusivly, except
for a nurse and a guard,
that saw a girlfriend that looks like her...
- Please, Patrick, give me a break, would you?
Do you know what the
strangest thing is?
The agent, the FBI guy...I figure
if he was somewhere around a Holly,
he would know when and
if she left the building.
But... - But what?
A homicide lady called the L.A. field office,
and FBI said there is no agent White.
They have no FBI involvement at all.
So, who the fuck is this guy White?
You still have that baseball bat
that you keep in the car?
Girls best friend? - Yeah.
- Yeah, why?
I think its time to pay
Mr.White a little visit.
Good boy. Let's go.
What's the matter? Chickin' it out,
Highsmith? - No, I just...
Come on!
- Go, go, go.
Alright. So, where are we going? - There.
I'm right behind you.
Mr.White?
"Avon" calling Mr. White.
It's opened.
Hello?
Hello?
Are you comming or what,
Patrick? - I'm comming.
I think you were talking
about gardening variety.
Hello?
Anybody here? Cause I have
very big bat in my hands.
Hallo?
Nathan!
I feel kind strange for
runing away like this.
Without saying goodbye, or anything.
You are not running away, honey.
Just protecting yourself.
You are doing a right thing.
You know, I hope your
mom kept your winter clothes,
cause you'll need them when
you  go back east.
It's gonna be cold.
Patrick?
Patrick, check it out!
Wait a minute! - No!
Give it a rest, Patrick.
We are calling the caps.
Hold on, this wasn't here last night!
- What do you mean "Hold on"?
I'm holding a knife with blood,
and we are calling the caps.
Who is it?
What are you doing?
This is my problem and my decision.
You let me make it Ok? - Yeah.
It's your funeral, asshole!
Patrick, company!
And on bail?
I hope you're not leaving on my count.
- No, it's health reasons.
Polution and such...
Patrick, I think we should go
visit your sick cousin, you know.
Now, before it's too late.
We'll not staying. We just came to
pick up the rest of Holly's things.
If you don't mind, I'd like to
keep the apartment.
Sure.
Holly, this is big mistake. We talked
about returning to New York.
Returning to therapy. - No.
You're too vulnerable to
be alone on your own.
Look, she's gonna come back
and she's gonna try kill.
I can't allow to do that.
Patrick, you're gonna miss your flight.
Holly, you know I have best
interests in that part.
Do you not handle the situation
by yourself. - Like hell I can't!
You don't owe me!
You're not my father!
I never said I was, Holly.
Fine. You're free to do what you wish.
It was nice to meet you, Patrick.
Likewise.
You have my number in N.Y.
in case you need me.
Patrick, let's give Holly some
little privacy, shall we?
Patrick, get my coat and lets
take a walk.
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
You know, I... - Don't even
think about, Patrick!
Ellie, you know she didn't hang Nathan.
This knife wasn't there last night.
What do you mean by that?
- It would be seen. She's been set off.
What are you, Dick Tracy? Why don't you
let caps doing their job?
Because she's as good as snail,
if I make any call. - So what?
So what! So...
I believe you.
I don't think you attacked
your brother.
You said you want to try beat this thing.
I wanna help you.
Why?
Since I was in mature school,
I've never gone in fights.
I was gonna chicken, you know,
a really chicken "Highsmith".
I don't wanna be chicken anymore.
I always admire people who stood up
what they believed in.
People who chose faith over fear.
Holly, that's not what this is about.
That's weird. - What's weird?
Nothing. Come on.
Oh, you've got a picture
of your father, right?
Yeah. I'm always carrying around.
- Let me see.
Thanks.
No, you're wrong. It's her.
It's Doppelganger.
A woman killed my mother and
the people the live in the building
they assert me, not my father.
Ok, it's alright. I believe you.
It's 8:30 in the morning,
practicaly night. Who is it?
Its me. Open up!
Patrick? Check it out.
Bonnie and Clyde.
Wait a moment, I go get silver hide.
Very funny. I need to ask you
two favors. - Two favors?
You need to ask me two favors?
Let me tell you something, Patrick Highsmith.
I've been doing nothing but
fucking favors last six months.
I've been waiting for you alone
like a dog. I've been suffering.
I've been hoping we could
back togehter again
and you've been totally
ignore my fucking feelings.
And now your bucking with
this homicide debutant.
Would you watch your mouth, Ellie?
Watch your dick pinhead!
It's terminally lodge in your brain.
And another thing, dumpboy...
You think, you and Jacqueline the Rapper
could crash here for few days,
before you make a run off board.
You have another thing coming, pal.
Good morning, Patrick.
Good morning Miss room-mate.
Gooding.
What ...what are you saying about
six months of suffering? - Okey.
I'm a slythe, you're slythe.
Who wants coffee?
Can we speak alone please?
- Yes, please.
I will be right back.
Morning, sir.
Gosh, you painted the kitchen.
My God, you're handsome.
You like quiche?
So whats the favor, Patrik?
The first is - you know that woman
that you used to work for at...
"Phone Sex" nun. - Sister Jan, yeah.
Yeah, whatever. I need to talk to her.
Oh, great. So, now I'm gonna be your social
secretary. Booking your apointments too.
Terrific.
- Ok.
Second favor?
I'd like Holly to stay here for few
hours...just a couple hours.
Yes, I'm Vegas Show off girl. And I do
remember noticing you in one of shows.
Me too. I feel the
atraction right away.
I've totally turn out,
thinking about that...
Excuse me, my name is Patrick...
I'm here to see sister Jan.
Yes, I am touching myself.
And I'm totally naked.
I'm sorry, sir. Your
credit card is expired.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Thanks for you call.
Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm friend of Ellie's.
She said she called.
- Yes, she called.
I can't spend much time
with you, I'm sorry.
Ellie said you want to ask
me about Doppelgangers.
What is it you want to know?
Is the Doppelganger thing is real or...
or is this just some sort of
schizophrenic condition?
In nature, every element is dual.
Every entity has its opposity
which is composed of exactly
same elements as the entity.
Think about it.  Every day has a night.
Male has female.
Good has evil.
"Intimate Strangers".
How may I help you?
"Jonathan Brothers" for Roxy...
Mr. Brothers, Roxy will be
right with you.
No problem. We have your
credit card number on file.
Have you met your Doppelganger?
No. I'm not asking for me.
It's for a friend. It's woman.
Now, if this thing is true,
where did it come from?
Why is it here? What does it want?
Why? Where? What?
Lets see - "Where"? I have no idea.
There's theory, you can take
it or leave it...
The Doppelgangers exist in limbo state
between our world of the
living and world of the dead.
Does make them walking dead? Maybe.
"Why" and "What"?
It's probably forced out by
some kind of trauma.
It just wants to survive like
any other entity.
It's very suspicious like an
animal in the jungle.
Totally instinctive, totally unreasonable.
Since want to split, once
there are two of you,
the Doppelganger doesn't want to reunite.
Enjoy its freedom.
It will do anything to defend it.
What can we do - to reunit it.
Love...Plain and simple.
The best side of men's soul.
It'll reunit two halfs calming
the Doppleganger by passifying it.
It will do anything to avoid love.
It'll try to scare love away,
to drive it off.
But ultimately, love does the trick.
Love allows both halfs
to go exists peacefully.
"Intimate Strangers".
How may I help you?
Your credit card, please.
I gotta go. Thank you.
Who are you?
Did you paint this?
That is from by "Blue period", also
known as "my bullshit period".
Do you believe in angels? I do.
Hello? - Ellie, It's me.
- Yeah. Hi, Patrick?
Is Holly there.
- Yes, she's great.
I wanna talk to him. - No.
I don't need to talk to her, just
keep there, okay Elie?
Right now - I can't talk to...
What the hell?
Hello!
Hello.
Do you have smoke?
- No, I don't smoke.
Did you see a woman walked through
here couple minutes ago?
Nah. - Great.
This is him. I mean,
it's gotta be him. No doubt.
The same face, same scar,
same everything. - Hold up here!
Hang on a second.
Somebody attacked you, alright?
You should call the police.
Yeah, and tell them what?
Dead man attacked me?
They will give me a room
right next to Fred's.
Sorry.
I don't get it, Patrick.
Was sex that good?
Ok. So, why don't you guys
just go some place.
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Patrick, you're not a hero type.
Listen to me. What are gonna do?
Playing exorcist? What?
I'll get it.
Is Holly there?
Yes, she is.
Can I talk to her, please?
Just a minute.
Holly, it's for you. It's not
Dr.Heller. It's a woman.
It's her.
What do you want?
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna see you.
Where?
At home. Do you remember home?
Tonight. At midnight.
I will not harm you. But, if your friend
comes  with you, I will harm him.
No, I'll come alone.
You are not going anywhere alone.
- Patrick, please.
I'm really tired and I don't
want anyone else get hurt,
specially you.
So, please just give me a car keys.
No, this is gonna stop, Ok?
I'm stucked in a fucking nightmare.
Well, I'm glad to hear you to say
you stucked, Patrick.
Because on secondery thought
you'd suggest to follow Elvira.
No, no, no,...
Watch over girl.
We gonna lose her.
She's changing lines. She's changing lines!
Follow! Don't loose her!
I can see, she's changing lines.
What do you think, I'm blind?
You did some stupid thing
in your live, Patrick,
but this record for Guiniss book.
Stupid! Very, very stupid!
Watch where you drive.
- Excuse me?
Are you comming? - No.
Patrick, this is dangerous.
If you wanna make big mistake
like this, do on yor own. - Ok.
You call the police,
and tell them...
Make up a story.
Be carefull, you idiot!
One of your neighbours reported
leak. We're just taking precautions.
Hello. My name is Holly Gooding.
My name is Stanley White.
I'm speciall agent within F.B.I.
I'm Richard Wolf.
How do you do?
It would be nothing when people
be more fucking reasonable!
Why are you doing this?
- Why am I doing this?
Why am I gonna slice your throat,
you mean, fucking morone?
Because Holly is most beautifull thing
in the world. And she is mine!
And she's gonna stay mine!
If that means get her
locked away for good.
I gotta room for her picked up.
They gonna rest her for murder.
For her insanity. And that will be that.
Should have been since
she killed her mother.
But the legal system in this
country is totally fucked.
Which is why I had to go
through this masquerade.
This is too fuckin' precious.
You, actually, bought into
the Doppelganger bullshit!
Why would she kill her mother?
She did it, cause I told her to do.
At first time, I saw Holly
only professionally.
And then, well, unprofessionally,
for several years.
When I found out her mother
was including a trust plan to kill her,
I told Holly's other personality,
she had to defend herself.
She proceeded in her own unique,
uninhibitate way.
She was not aware in
consciousness.
Which is her father got away
with his business with her.
Anyway. One day, brother
Fredy walked into her with man.
Father chasted after the little boy.
Somehow, Fredy managed to
tripped him up, sent him
flying through the window.
Holly saw the whole thing.
She'd never forgot to Freddy.
You know what little girls feel
about their daddies?
I'm not really enjoy killing you.
Please, listen. Wait!
- No, Patrick. It's time!
What do you want?
What do you want?!!
Holly?
Oh, God! Please, don't!
Police! Move, move, move!
Freeze! Stop!
Another here!
Please don't hurt us!
Call the ambulance!
Don't look! Get back!
Check down the hall!
Yes! - Somebody down!
- Oh, God.
Let us pray.
Oh, Lord, we employ you
in your fatherly love.
Have mercy on the soul of
your servant Holly Gooding.
And grant that freed from
the strains of mortal life.
She may recieve her
inheritance of eternal salvations.
Patrick? - I'll stay for a second.
