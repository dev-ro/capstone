The pot is hung here.
There are a couple of lunch boxes.
I'll stop here. Let's find out.
Yes. Stop here.
Oh, Lord.
Is this Mr. Shivendra's house?
Yeah, it is.
SHANTI KUNJ
SINCE 1936
Alok.
You look dope, bro.
Parchun.
This is not a time for jokes.
He must've been 27, 28.
Yes, his name was Astik.
It has only been
five months since their wedding.
Sandhya? The poor girl's in her room.
She hasn't come out since yesterday.
No, no, she's not inauspicious.
Their horoscopes were compatible.
Mom! Is my toothpaste in your suitcase?
I haven't unpacked yet.
So many guests are here. Ask anyone.
It's Achint.
Yes, he's all grown up now.
Listen.
You know I only use Pepsodent.
Go and wait. I'll get it for you.
I've had it.
These boys and their tantrums.
He's come for a funeral,
but wants his fancy toothpaste.
Greetings, Aunt Tulika.
Sandhya...
Is she okay?
I heard she's quite depressed.
Jiji, Gulu Didi
from Bahraich is on the line.
Saroj's auntie's daughter
whose husband is a government official.
I don't know how to explain.
It happened all of a sudden.
Yes, we did the cremation yesterday.
There was no point waiting.
Maybe this is where
his journey had to end.
May Goddess Radha bless his soul.
Yes. He's fine as well.
Careful. I'm having a bath.
How much per day for these mattresses?
Thirty-five rupees.
That's plain robbery.
No, sir. Mr. Rizvi knows
that your son has passed away,
hence he has already given you
a discount of 20%.
I don't want any favors.
My son has died.
I'm not asking for a discount.
The usual rate is 25 rupees.
That's all I'll pay.
Sandhya...
Yeah, well, we are all worried about her.
"He was the sun in a sky full of stars."
"Our deepest sorrows
that he's no more ours."
"RIP."
"May God help your soul..."
"Rest in peace."
It's all copy-pasted.
Please open the door.
Please open the door.
Get the doorbell changed, man.
Please open the door.
Where is Sandhya?
Mother!
Papa, Sangya and Snehu didn't come?
That's enough, Mom.
Enough now. Stop crying, Mom.
I'll send some tea.
- Mom.
- Yes.
- I don't want tea.
- Okay.
Please arrange for some Pepsi.
Parchun will get it from his shop.
Pepsi at a time like this?
Fine, let it be.
But I won't have tea.
Are you all right?
- Mom.
- Yes?
Mom, who took the bed out of my room?
- I don't know.
- I did.
- Why?
- Because Astik is still with us.
For 13 days,
the soul remains around the house.
The earthen pot on the tree outside
is where we give him food.
It takes ten days
for the soul to be free of its body.
On the thirteenth day, his soul
will be liberated and go to Yamlok.
You performed
the rituals for Astik's last rites.
You must follow these rules for 13 days.
No cigarettes, alcohol or tobacco.
One meal a day,
without turmeric, garlic and onions.
And sleep on the floor,
away from everyone else.
Why wasn't I informed of this before?
Can't you do this much
for your own dead brother?
I forgot to mention
Dad doesn't take sugar in his tea.
Easy. Take it easy, man.
If I'd died, Mom would've never asked
her beloved Astik to sleep on the floor.
What?
But if you were dead,
you'd be a buried corpse.
How would it matter to you anyway?
Come on, move from here.
Why am I asked
to do everything for everyone?
Astik never cared for anyone but himself.
Even after his death,
he remains a problem.
Sandhya's now a widow and I'm bald.
And now, your English lessons
from Sandhya will also stop.
At least you were
learning something from her.
Let it be, I'll do it.
Sit.
For how many days
are you planning to stay?
Thirteen days.
We're staying till the wake for sure.
Staying here?
Yes. Why?
You won't be able to.
They don't have western toilets here.
Only Indian style.
How will you bend down to use it?
It's been five months,
and I'm still not used to it.
Something is up with Sandhya.
I am sure of it. But Usha Bhabhi
is being secretive about it.
Janaki Didi?
- Tulika?
- When did you arrive?
Greetings, Bhai Sahab.
We just arrived.
We got a call last night
from Shivendra Bhai Sahab.
I got scared.
I thought Mother passed away.
Never imagined it would be Astik instead.
"As flies to wanton boys,
are we to the gods."
"They kill us for their sport."
Shakespeare.
How do you remember English poetry?
I don't even understand it.
Lunch is ready. Please come.
- Sure.
- Okay.
Her husband has left her.
She hasn't said anything,
but everyone knows.
He's in Dubai.
Right, Mother?
Usha.
Come on, Mom.
Usha is your daughter-in-law.
I am your daughter, Janaki.
You've forgotten everything.
Hey, listen.
What's the sleeping arrangement here?
Please open the door.
Will someone
just rip the wire off that bell!
Please open the door.
Please open the door.
Sorry, the bell...
Namaste.
Is this Shivendra Giri's house?
I'm Nazia Zaidi.
Nazia!
Leave the suitcase here.
I'll send it over.
Okay.
Nazia Zaidi.
I found out through Facebook.
Your sister had posted.
Yes, the post has 235 comments.
Bhabhi.
Bhabhi, Shivendra Uncle has asked me
to put her luggage in your room.
Shall I?
Come.
Here, I'll take it.
- Parchun.
- Yes?
Is your shop open?
Yes, Bhabhi, you want something?
Yes. A Pepsi for Nazia.
Okay.
And a packet of chips.
The spicy ones.
Alok couldn't stand this food either.
I'll get them.
- Mom...
- Eat this without any fuss.
Some more vegetable curry?
Nobody is eating properly.
Giri ji, please check with Sandhya...
if she wants to live with you for a while.
No.
What will she do there?
This is her home now.
We'll ask her later.
Right now, she's too distressed.
PTSD.
Post-traumatic stress disorder.
It's psychological.
Mental trauma.
Quite a common occurrence
in such circumstances.
Mr. Ghanshyam is a banker.
But he has knowledge
about everything else as well.
What's going on with you, Sandhya?
Why are you behaving
like nothing has happened?
Nazia.
You know, when I was a kid,
we had a cat, Katrina.
She got run over by a car.
I cried a lot.
And didn't eat anything for three days.
I don't feel like that at all.
I don't feel like crying,
and I feel hungry all the time.
Honestly, I feel like running away.
But I can't.
Tayaji, anything else?
Yes, I'm going to slap you.
Pay your respects to your brother.
That's better. Let's go.
Ammi, Sandhya wants me
to stay here till the wake.
Don't worry, I'll do my laundry.
Or I'll wear Sandhya's.
Yes, they'll fit. She's my size.
Ammi, I'll call you back.
Get up and sit on the chair.
Hurry, sit on the chair.
Nazia, go look for some scraps of paper.
- What are you up to, Mummy?
- I'm saying...
Just listen to me. Get up. Come on.
Sit on the chair. Sit, please.
Yes.
Go see if you can find a stone
or something I can put the wok on.
Stone?
What are you waiting for?
Start searching. You'll find something.
Auntie, a stone.
Now put the wok on the stone.
Hurry. Tear up the newspaper as well.
Get moving.
Nazia, why are you playing along?
Let her.
You keep at it.
I knew it
the minute I saw you this morning.
You've been jinxed by an evil eye.
But I'll fix it.
This is your house, too.
They can't just kick you out.
What are you blabbering on about?
Who is kicking me out?
You don't know what's going on.
Please don't protest, for my sake.
Lift your feet.
I beg you, lift your feet.
You and your superstitions, Mummy.
I've been seeing them since childhood.
When I fell off my bicycle
in the sixth grade,
remember, you told me
that the evil eye had jinxed me.
You kept checking
if any of my bones were broken,
saying, "Who would marry a cripple?"
You were so concerned
about getting me married,
you returned my brand-new bicycle.
Amazing.
Instead of getting me a tutor,
you made me wear
a sapphire ring on my right pinkie.
So I would get better grades in school.
Weren't you top of your class
when you did your English MA?
I was. But did it matter?
Of course it did. You got a nice groom.
He earned Rs. 70,000 per month.
And now?
What are you doing?
Only your tears
can get rid of the evil eye.
I don't know that,
but this will kill me for sure.
- So much smoke. The evil spirit is strong.
- Let it go, Mummy.
Who has come at this time?
Go, keep it outside. Hurry.
What are you doing?
Sandhya darling?
Who is it?
It's me.
Alka ji, it's me.
Please stay strong, Alka ji.
So much smoke?
Mom, it's coming from the lane outside.
It's unbearable.
Bhabhi, it's the boys in the lane.
They burn old tires for their bonfire.
I'll handle them.
Ghanshyam Uncle will be going to...
Astik's...
He'll be going
to get his death certificate and...
He also has some bank work,
so he will need
Astik's bank documents and ID.
Can you please
check for them in his cupboard?
Come inside.
Bhabhi.
I was wondering if I should
take Nazia out for dinner.
Pappu Tayaji said
we are still in mourning...
and need to maintain purity.
What is going on?
You're disrespecting the rituals.
Aren't you as well?
Don't argue.
Go to your room and go to sleep.
Today I'll make you try
the best mutton biryani in the world.
You've never tasted anything like it.
I haven't. I'm a vegetarian.
Nazia ji, you?
You don't eat non-veg?
No.
Well, not every Tendulkar is Sachin.
Well, not a problem.
We have equally famous
and tasty vegetarian food as well.
FOR MY SWEETHEART...
Why does this moment
Hurt so much?
Why am I so
Angry at myself?
How do I
Ask him?
Why did he turn out to be a cheater?
Angry at myself
I do have desires
But I'm afraid of life
I rise and fall
Life is mad at me
Like shooting stars
My heart, you fly away
And show me a way
Listen...
if Sandhya wants
to come back home with us, then...
talk to her.
We have
two unmarried daughters at home already.
You can't even manage small things,
yet you talk so big.
My eyes
Are silent
I don't know
What they want
The dreams
That were in these eyes
Why did they fade away?
How do I know?
We had a lot of faith in God.
I named my son Astik.
I do have desires
But I'm afraid of life
I rise and fall
Life is mad at me
Like shooting stars
My heart, you fly away
And show me a way
Didi, have your tea.
Let it be. I'll do it.
Go and have you tea.
Thank you, Jhumri.
Good morning.
Slept well?
The one in the red cup is for you.
Why? Is it special?
Well, yes, it is.
Usha Auntie made it especially for you.
Thanks.
Is it too sweet?
No, it's fine.
Don't worry, I'll get it replaced.
Jhumri, you go and make some tea for her.
Didi, I have lots of work.
I need to give Grandma her tea.
Leave Grandma's cup here.
I'll give it to her.
And see those files on the table?
Give them to Mom.
- Nazia?
- Yes.
I'll go give Grandma her tea.
Usha Chachi, here.
The documents you'd asked for.
Husband, you're very forgetful.
The riverbank will be cold.
Take this shawl with you.
No. The weather will be pleasant today.
I checked it on Google already.
- Giri ji?
- Yes.
Please, sit, no formalities.
We'll collect the ashes
from the crematorium
and head straight for Kanpur
to pour the ashes into the holy Ganges.
All right. Let's go.
What will you guys do there?
The four of us are enough.
Your wallet.
He said not to bother.
That's the agreement, yes?
Okay.
Okay, we will see you in 30 minutes.
Did you find the receipt?
No, I gave it to Alok.
He's looking for it.
You guys are very careless.
Which receipt, Tayaji?
The one we got
from the crematorium with the pyre number,
to make sure we get Astik's ashes.
That receipt? I have it.
Couldn't you tell one of us?
We're going to be late,
and you're goofing around on the ladder.
You asked me to change the bell, old man.
That's what...
Don't argue with me.
Go check if Alok is ready.
Come on, go!
And you, take the ladder away.
Take it away!
Don't change this bell now.
Remove the ladder!
Alok, have you put on your pants yet?
These morons don't value time.
They are lazing around.
Your family is extremely disorganized.
If we didn't need to go,
they could have informed us yesterday.
I woke up early and got ready for nothing.
Grandma.
I am going to tell you something.
But you can't tell anyone, okay?
Look.
Astik's girlfriend.
She's nothing special.
I mean, her nose is weird.
She isn't fair.
She doesn't look
that well-educated either.
Definitely hasn't done an MA.
Do you know her?
Who is she, Grandma?
Usha.
Come on, kid, hurry up.
We are really late.
Finally draped your dhoti?
Let's go.
Mom, I have to pee.
Why did you drink so much water?
I already told you not to.
Hi, Tarun.
No, son.
You don't touch feet
during the mourning period.
- That's Tarun's son?
- Yup.
Aditya.
- What does he do?
- He is jobless.
But trying to start a restaurant.
He came to my husband for a loan.
Mom, where's the washroom?
That... tin door there.
Tarun, you've come quite late.
You should ask Shivendra about that.
I don't even know if he wanted me to come.
That's not the case, Tarun.
Let it be, Bhai Sahab.
This isn't the time for this conversation.
But I don't think you consider me family.
But what's the matter?
Ask him.
Did he inform me?
Such a huge thing happened in the family,
and he didn't even think to tell me.
It wasn't intentional, Tarun.
This isn't the first time
you've ignored me.
You've had an issue with me
for 15 years,
since I got my job
at the Income Tax Department.
My wife, Rashmi, so lovingly
made a family WhatsApp group,
but he left that, too.
You've come here
to mourn or to pick a fight?
You're the one who started it.
That's enough.
Go get settled in. We're going to
collect Astik's ashes. We'll talk later.
I'll come along.
There is no space in the car now.
You should've come earlier.
Let's go.
Bhai...
Let's go. Hope the driver's still here.
What were you doing in there?
Baking cookies.
Get out of my way. "Baking cookies."
What are you looking for?
There was a packet of chips here.
I ate them last night.
Want to eat some golgappas?
I want to eat.
I want to go out and eat golgappas.
Sandhya, you've seriously lost it.
You're making no sense.
Why? Astik can do
all the nonsense he wants,
and I can't even eat golgappas?
What has Astik done?
You want to come with me or not?
Will they even allow you to go out?
Let's see.
Get off the phone
and tell me how this pattern is looking.
Did Ghanshyam eat before he left?
It takes time
to process requests at a bank.
Don't worry. He won't take much time.
He's an expert.
Remember, just two weeks ago,
his uncle passed away.
He handled all the paperwork then, too.
You know what, Tulika?
Sometimes when we don't have something,
we don't want
other people to have it either.
Rinku, listen.
You know how Janaki is.
Why are you paying attention to her?
They're not even
capable of bearing a child,
and she's taking jabs at me.
- Mom.
- What happened, sweetie? Need something?
Mom, I'm going
to visit the doctor with Nazia.
What's the matter?
Is everything all right?
My stomach
has been aching since last night.
Do you have a fever?
No, just a stomachache
and a little uneasiness.
Okay. Shall I come?
Or better yet, we can call Dr. Ali home.
No, it's okay. Nazia can take me.
It's just a stomachache.
But, sweetie,
it's better if someone goes along.
Why are you forcing her, Jiji?
You can't keep her
locked up at home, away from the world.
Fine, you go.
I'll call Dr. Ali and inform him.
- Okay.
- Go.
Listen, take some money.
- No, Mother, I have money.
- Just in case you need it, take it.
Now?
Now what?
First the doctor, then golgappas.
Let's go.
[chanting and praying]
Here to immerse the ashes
in the holy Ganges?
Come with me, sir.
Sir, tell us whose ashes those are.
Your mother? Father? We can offer a deal.
They are my son's ashes.
Do you have...
any special discounts for that?
ASGAR ALI'S DISPENSARY
- Sandhya Giri.
- Yes, that's me.
Come. You're next.
Parchun, wait here
and keep an eye on the shoes.
This place is full of petty thieves.
Stay here.
[chanting and praying]
Put your right hand forward.
For the oath.
Name of the deceased?
Astik Giri.
Make it extra spicy.
Aren't you scared
that someone might see us here, Sandhya?
I'm not thinking about it.
Then what are you thinking about?
Sir, I've arranged for a nice boat.
We will go to the middle
of the holy Ganges and immerse the ashes.
We're not here for a boat ride.
Why do we need to go in that far?
We can immerse the ashes anywhere.
Sir, you're scared
of going far into the holy Ganges.
Imagine how far the soul has to travel.
What do you mean?
There was once a man,
evil, greedy, cunning,
used to letch on other's wives.
I found it in Astik's cupboard.
One day he went to the jungle
and fell prey to a tiger.
Yamdoot arrived immediately
to escort his soul to Yamlok.
In Yamlok, Chitragupt started accounting
for that man's ill deeds
and sentenced him
to a list of punishments in hell.
To be bitten by snakes,
to be drowned in boiling oil, whiplashes,
pain and torture.
Pandit ji, what's the need to go further?
Let's immerse the ashes here.
Don't worry, sir.
Listen to the whole story.
I want to meet this girl.
What's the point in that?
I don't know.
Meanwhile, here on Earth,
his corpse lay rotting.
Suddenly, an eagle came
and took a bone from his body
and flew up into the sky.
Another eagle, upon seeing the bone,
tried to snatch it away.
Both the eagles
started fighting over that bone,
and while doing so,
they flew over the holy Ganges.
Suddenly, the bone fell out
of their beaks and into the holy Ganges.
Astik will be cursed for this.
His soul will never find peace.
Come on. Why curse the departed?
Whatever may have happened,
he was your husband.
So you can forgive him.
Only I can forgive him.
But why should I?
Let him hang from this tree forever.
Sandhya...
And as soon as the bone
fell into the holy Ganges,
all the misdeeds
of that sinner were washed away.
And Yamaraj
had to send him to heaven.
And that's the purpose behind
immersing the ashes into the holy Ganges.
Mom, we immersed the ashes
right in the middle of the holy Ganges.
So Astik's sins
have all been washed clean.
My brother is now in heaven.
A lifetime of theft,
robbery, rape and selfish motives.
All washed clean if your ashes
are immersed in the holy Ganges.
How is that fair?
How can the holy Ganges forgive?
Did he marry the holy Ganges or me?
- Sit up straight.
- I am.
You're not. I'm trying to braid your hair.
It's like a jungle.
- Adi.
- Yes?
Have you spoken to
Ghanshyam Uncle about your bank loan?
Mother, this isn't the time for that.
Why not?
Are we supposed to
just sit and sulk till the wake?
Fine. I'll speak to him. Anyway, there'll
be enough time in the next few days.
How long do we have to stay?
I've told you.
For all 13 days of the wake.
What will I do here for so many days?
You've got your books, right? So study.
Ma, study here?
Those who need to study
will do so under street lamps if needed.
Please, kids who claim
to have studied under street lamps,
usually end up in politics,
because they're pathological liars.
What are you saying?
- Now, where are you off to?
- To find a street lamp.
What the hell? You scared me.
Are you stalking me?
Not much else to do here,
so I just followed you.
What grade are you in?
- Ninth.
- I'm in tenth.
So?
So, kiddo, you're younger.
Maintain distance and respect. Understand?
Is the cucumber for me?
Well then, offer me some.
I have downloaded the form.
Will everything be online?
Sandhya Didi,
Pappu Tayaji has called for you.
You carry on, I'll come.
Sandhya, a few of
Astik's colleagues have come to meet you.
Hello, ma'am.
We are very sorry for your loss.
We'll all miss him.
He was a very good man.
He was a very good man.
Sandhya...
- You are?
- Akansha.
Astik's colleague.
- I am so sorry for your...
- Akansha.
Akansha, I would like to speak to you.
Mom, I found
some of Astik's work documents.
I'll just hand those over to her.
Please sit.
Which documents were you talking about?
Astik kept it safe.
So you really did love him, right?
I never had a hint of suspicion.
It's not...
It's not what you think.
He never...
Astik never cheated on you.
What's the point of lying now?
I'm not lying.
We did love each other.
But after you got married,
we were just colleagues.
Nothing more.
How long had you known him?
We were in college together.
Met the very first year.
Then got jobs at the same company.
Then why didn't you marry him?
My parents didn't approve.
You refused to marry him
just to please your family?
And you also agreed to marry him
just to please your family.
But he did still love you.
Even now, he kept your photograph safe.
How about you?
Sorry.
Akansha,
I know I have no right to question you.
But the person
who does owe me an explanation is now...
Even if he was around,
what would I have said to him?
We rarely spoke.
His tastes were different.
Once, I gifted him a shirt,
a beautiful printed one.
He didn't wear it even once.
He just stuck to his usual office shirts.
Formal.
Blue.
His favorite color.
What happened, Sandhya?
What's all this on the bed?
Blue...
Astik's favorite color was blue.
All his shirts, T-shirts...
Everything is blue.
She was right.
Who?
"Akansha Roy. Vice President Marketing."
Your shawl is on the bed.
Listen.
What is it?
Astik...
It will be okay.
Guru ji has said, "It'll all be okay."
"The almighty tests us."
"We must accept his wishes."
Please, listen to me.
What is it?
There's so much that he left unfinished.
How will we run the house ourselves?
Especially with the home loan to repay.
So...
why don't you tell your guru ji...
to send Astik back?
So he can repay the loans.
I'll open the door.
Alok.
You're allowed out of your room?
Why? You won't go report
to Pappu Tayaji, will you?
Why should I care?
Okay. I have something urgent
I need to do with you.
Tell me.
We need to publish
Astik's obituary in the newspaper.
Babaji asked me to write it in English.
I thought I'd run it by you.
Read it out.
Why don't you read it yourself?
No, you go ahead.
I can't read your handwriting.
It looks like a drunk ant
crawled through ink on your notebook.
Come on. It isn't that bad.
I've written...
"With heavy grief, we inform..."
Not "heavy." "Profound."
"Profound..."
Pro... found.
It means deep.
Profound.
"With profound grief, we inform you
of the death of our respected..."
Change that to "demise."
Change "profound"?
No. Change "death" to "demise."
"Death" doesn't sound good.
Yeah. Go on, write. S-E...
"With profound grief, we inform you
of the demise
of our respected Astik Giri..."
Not "respected."
"Beloved."
But beloved is used for girls.
It can be used for boys as well.
"Beloved Astik Giri."
Listen. You leave your notebook with me.
I'll rewrite it properly.
Okay.
This needs to be
submitted tomorrow morning.
Okay.
Bhabhi...
Let me know if you need anything.
Stop here.
- Sandhya, I'll come along with you.
- No. I'll be fine. You carry on.
Sorry.
I called you to meet on a workday.
Must've been busy in the office, right?
No, come, that's fine.
Sit. Please, sit.
I've been meaning to talk to you myself.
Really? Why? What about?
I've been feeling so guilty.
Believe me, Sandhya...
We hardly spoke
after you both got married.
We didn't speak much either.
But I just assumed this is how it is.
People fall in and out of love in college.
But I was never able to.
I was always too scared.
I thought...
maybe Astik also
didn't understand love, just like me.
But having met you, I realize now
that he was quite the romantic.
Wasn't he?
Your order, ma'am?
Yeah...
I'll have a cappuccino.
- Yeah, Sandhya?
- Same.
Two cappuccinos.
Okay, ma'am.
Tell me.
I won't feel bad at all, I promise.
In person... he was not that expressive,
but on Valentine's Day,
cards, WhatsApp messages, emails...
He wrote a lot of romantic rubbish.
You guys met in the office every day?
And you went out for dates too, right?
Before he...
Before you both got married.
Where did you guys go together?
Why are you asking these questions?
I don't know.
I just want to know.
Where would you two go?
What did you talk about? Everything.
I was his wife.
I'm just asking you
to share some old memories.
If that's possible.
[chanting and praying]
I'm suffering a little less
I'm not a stranger anymore
My heart has opened up
To new hopes
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi. Good morning.
I'm not a stranger anymore
I'm not a stranger anymore
I have some new hopes
These little happinesses
Were hiding inside me
I'm not a stranger anymore
I love my life now
That's Usha's guru ji.
Yes.
It was my idea to call him.
A discourse on the Bhagavad Gita
helps calm the restless mind.
- Idiot.
- Why are you hitting me?
What does he attain?
He attains Vaishnav padh.
He has a divine aura.
Aura?
Hey, birdie
Hey, birdie
Hey, birdie
Speaking new words to me
My heart smiles for no reason
My heart is acting
Crazy and stubborn
I refused, he agreed
The sunshine and shadows
Are one now
I've found a way
That leads to you
I have new hopes now
These little happinesses
Were hiding inside me
I'm not a stranger anymore
I love my life now
Aditi, listen to me, please. What's wrong?
I told you, not on the lips.
Yeah, but this is how it is done, right?
Technically, we are related.
Yeah, but very distant cousins, no?
Fair enough. Okay, but just this once.
Okay.
That's an enema.
It helps ease her stomachaches.
Just remember to wash your hands later.
Yes.
Did your father tell you
to sit here with Grandma?
- No, I just wanted to.
- Usha!
- Please, let me. I'll feed her.
- No, you won't be able to.
- Usha!
- Coming, wait a minute.
Mom, do you have an antacid pill?
Nazia's stomach is upset
because of restaurant food.
Yeah, I'll give you the pill in a second.
But can you feed Grandma please?
- He's calling out for me repeatedly.
- Usha!
Usha!
Can you get food sent upstairs for Alok?
And then ask the caterer
to serve us as well. It's getting late.
- Giri ji.
- Yeah?
Whatever has happened is heartbreaking.
But right now, we must remember
to focus on Sandhya's future.
Sandhya has her whole life ahead of her.
Why should she live alone?
We are quite open-minded
about such things. Have some.
After all, we live in the modern era.
If Sandhya wishes to, she can remarry.
- What nonsense are you talking, Tarun?
- It's not nonsense, Bhai Sahab.
Look, Sandhya's a nice girl
with a good education.
She will easily find some good suitors.
Newchance.com.
There are many such sites on the Internet
exclusively for divorcees and widowers.
If you approve,
I can create a profile for her.
Usha.
That should be enough.
Sandhya ji.
- Move. You're in the middle of the road.
- Just go, man.
Parchun.
You replaced the doorbell with this?
Tayaji, you only gave me 50 rupees.
This all you get for 50 rupees.
"All you get for 50 rupees."
Jhumri, see who's at the door.
Shibu!
Can I check the door?
No, let Jhumri do it. You sit with me.
The priest has sent
the shopping list for the wake.
Let me explain it to you.
Please, come.
- If you don't understand...
- Tayaji, he's here to meet Sandhya.
Hello, I'm B.K. Arora.
Mr. Arora. Hello!
Hello, Mr. Ghanshyam. How are you?
Good. I was the one who approached you.
Yes, yes.
- Please sit.
- Yes.
Bhai Sahab, this is Mr. B.K. Arora
from IndiaFirst Life Insurance.
Yes.
I just needed to get
some papers signed by Mrs. Sandhya.
Why?
Astik Giri took a life insurance from us.
He chose the five million rupee policy.
And made his wife Sandhya the beneficiary.
So we need her to sign some papers
and collect the check.
Who else is a beneficiary?
His parents, surely.
No.
It's a single beneficiary.
Only his wife, Sandhya Giri.
- Sandhya... I'll get Sandhya.
- Yes, thank you.
Come on, hurry. Come.
Someone important is here to meet you.
Mother, what are you doing?
He is waiting with everyone downstairs.
The scarf! Let's go quickly.
Nazia! Mom!
Hello, Mrs. Sandhya.
I am really sorry for your loss.
Our company extends their support to you.
- Please, sit.
- Yes.
Move over.
Sit.
Your husband bought a policy
in your name worth five million rupees.
I've done what was needed...
...and I have the forms with me.
Yes.
I need you to just check and sign them.
Here you go.
Move the table closer please.
Nazia, take the glass of water away.
Jhumri.
Yes?
- Take the water away, please.
- Okay.
Pen. Do you have pen?
- Does anyone have a pen?
- Giri ji, give your daughter a pen.
Pen? It's somewhere inside.
Pen... Bring one.
I have a pen.
Sign right here, please.
What?
Ghanshyam, we trusted you as our own.
How am I at fault here?
Astik chose Sandhya
as his beneficiary, not me.
But you could have
informed us earlier at least.
What difference would that have made?
Even if you knew earlier,
you couldn't have changed the beneficiary.
And I assumed...
Astik must have told you
that the beneficiary was Sandhya.
He was your son, after all.
Don't bother with him.
He watches crime shows on TV all day,
and yet isn't aware of the crimes
happening under his own roof.
This is no crime, Bhai Sahab.
Sandhya was dependent on Astik,
so he made her the beneficiary. That's it.
"Made her the beneficiary."
What about you?
Weren't you dependent on him too?
Astik was making good money,
which is why he made you retire.
And he used your retirement fund to pay
the first loan installment of a new home.
Now, how will you pay
the rest of the installments?
You don't worry about me.
By the grace of God,
I still have this ancestral house.
Really? This ancestral house?
That's forever been stuck
under dispute in court.
Let it be, Tarun,
you're talking to a brick wall here.
He still thinks he's like Adani or Ambani.
No. I know I'm no Adani or Ambani.
While Astik was alive,
I had strength and support.
Now that he's gone...
nothing can be done.
That's not true.
This is India.
Miracles happen here every day.
Let's try and convince Mr. Arora.
Why? What will he do?
You stay out of this.
Shibu, there's a lot
that is still in Arora's control.
Let's go meet him. Come on.
You're all here? What's going on?
Nothing, Mr. Pandey.
I was just explaining
the rituals for the bake...
No, I mean, the wake. Please join us.
- Bhabhi?
- Yeah.
You know what just crossed my mind today?
What?
Dolly Ki Doli.
What is that?
Dolly Ki Doli.
It's a movie starring Sonam Kapoor.
Where do I get to watch movies?
What's so special about that movie?
In that film, Sonam Kapoor,
on the very night
she's welcomed into the family,
robs them of everything and runs away
even before consummating the marriage.
Whether anyone else
knows of this movie or not,
Sandhya's mom surely must have watched it.
Don't hog all the peanuts. Pass me some.
Do you want to get
any of your clothes ironed?
No. Nazia did them this morning.
- Where is she?
- She has gone out for dinner with Parchun.
Your in-laws are very backward.
Even her teacup
is segregated from the rest.
Did you notice earlier today,
how everyone was staring at you
while you were signing
the insurance papers?
Mummy, you watch too many TV soaps.
I don't think
you should stay here anymore.
You're educated.
You can start your life again.
Come home with us after the wake.
We'll figure out what to do next.
Sandhya.
Some tea?
Yes.
Where are your parents?
They live in Delhi.
I live here alone.
Alone.
Sugar?
Lots of it.
You like this Ayurvedic tea, too?
I hate it.
I saw it here, so...
It was Astik's favorite tea.
Let's go up.
Here's my bedroom.
And this is my favorite spot.
I spend a lot of time here.
Is it nice?
It's very nice.
It's all very nice.
This view.
Your house.
Your bedroom.
And this bed too.
It's all great.
Which side did Astik sleep on?
- What?
- You would sleep together, right?
- Sandhya, please.
- Tell me?
Don't.
Because of you,
Astik could never fall in love with me.
What are you on about?
I'm not an idiot, Akansha.
I get it all. Even after our marriage,
Astik stayed away from me.
We didn't have one real conversation.
I never saw love for me in his eyes. Why?
Because you kept fulfilling his needs.
Stop.
Is that all you wanted to know?
He never cheated on you.
He wasn't like that.
We did love each other.
We really did.
And you'll never understand the feeling.
You're too narrow-minded, Sandhya.
I feel sorry for you.
I wish you could
have discovered the real Astik.
Sometimes ages

Life speaks sweetly
But it tastes bitter
Slowly, slowly, little by little
All the hopes shattered bit by bit
We are all so naive, we fail to understand
The circus of this life
Slowly, slowly, little by little
All the hopes shattered bit by bit
We are so naive, we fail to understand
- The circus of this life
- Crazy, crazy, crazy
The monk wanders
Looking for diamonds in wasteland
Crazy, crazy, crazy
- The monk wanders
- Had there been a spell to heal the pain
- Crazy, crazy, crazy
- The mind is a puppet, a plaything
The monk wanders
Leaving relations behind
I'm the dyer
I'm the potter
I'm the hate
I'm the love
The whole truth is in me
I'm the particle
I'm the world
Will perform rebirth rites
Will burn our spirit
Flowers will bloom in the graveyard
Will do some magic like this
Slowly, slowly, little by little
All the hopes shattered bit by bit
We are so naive, we fail to understand
The circus of this life
Slowly, slowly, little by little
All the hopes shattered bit by bit
We are so naive, we fail to understand
The circus of this life
Crazy, crazy, crazy
The monk wanders
Looking for diamonds in the wasteland
Crazy, crazy, crazy
- The monk wanders
- Tears are silver, pain is gold
Either a sunbeam or the darkness
- Crazy, crazy, crazy
- The mind is a puppet, a plaything
The monk wanders
Leaving relations behind
Today marks the tenth day of mourning.
Today Astik's soul becomes whole again.
On the thirteenth day,
Astik's soul will embark
on a journey to heaven with his ancestors.
You can now immerse the holy offerings.
[chanting and praying]
Now, we tell Astik that for ten days,
"We arranged for food and water for you."
Now we pray to the almighty God
that He guide his soul to heaven.
Alok, kindly liberate your brother.
Sandhya.
What happened?
I have forgiven Astik.
Now I feel like crying.
But I'm also feeling very hungry.
What? Stop it!
Spices,
mattresses, quilts. 3,084...
Sugar.
- Babaji.
- What?
Did I mess something up?
No, child.
I was... just doing some accounting.
Here. Let me help you.
I'll read out the numbers.
You can calculate.
Is this all for the wake?
Twenty kilos of rice... 1,160.
Fifteen kilos of clarified butter... 6,960.
Twelve kilos of lentils... 1,200.
Nawabi tent house... 6,080.
No, actually, 6,088.
There's a lot of money being spent.
You can go.
I'll manage the rest.
So, Mr. Arora. What do you think?
I have nothing to think about.
You need to understand.
Nothing can be done.
I've told you repeatedly.
We believe it's all in your hands.
If we need to gift you something,
I'm sure my brother can take care of it.
So, Mr. Shivendra Giri, you've come here
to betray your son's widow by bribing me?
We wanted to talk to you about something.
Yes, what is it?
Nazia, could you give us a moment?
Sure.
Bhai Sahab...
Listen. Wait.
Bhai Sahab, please, don't be so...
Don't you dare speak to me.
What you did was very wrong.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Isn't this what we came for?
Seriously? Why is he getting angry at me?
Make sure to remind Uncle.
Yes. Okay, I need to go.
I should not have listened to them.
I feel so humiliated.
Let it go.
But why let it go?
Tarun...
wanted me to bribe the agent.
If anyone finds out about it,
I would die of shame.
- No one will find out.
- What do you mean they won't find out?
Now it's done. Just let it go. Calm down.
You've stopped chanting these days.
That's why you're losing your temper.
Astik is gone...
leaving us to handle all this chaos.
It'll all be fine. Trust me.
I have spoken to Sandhya.
Rashmi had approached me.
Listen to me calmly.
She was saying that Aditya likes Sandhya.
So if we're okay with it, and...
And?
And if Sandhya wishes to...
Aditya is willing to marry her.
So...
You... went straight to Sandhya?
Yes, I'm worried for her future.
And how much...
did you ask for out of the five million?
Is this the path
your guru ji advised to pay off our loans?
By colluding with Rashmi.
You also went to the insurance office
out of desperation, right?
But it's okay.
If you can find
another way, then do tell me.
But until then...
she is just meeting Aditya.
However, ultimately it's her choice.
Grandma, time for your exercise.
The right one.
Mom says...
One moment.
You intend to marry me.
Your cousin's widow?
Yes. She's right.
But why?
Because I like you.
Grandma!
Look. You don't have prior experience.
So let me tell you.
Getting married without love
feels like eating dessert...
before the meal is served.
You're in the food business.
You must know this feeling, right?
Yes, but...
I have fallen in love with you.
So...
will you marry me?
What are you
looking there for, Bhai Sahab?
Parchun and Alok
hide here sometimes to sneak a smoke.
I've gotten
the expensive bottle out for you.
Check your drink. Is the ratio correct?
It's perfect.
We're in the middle of mourning
or else I would have congratulated you.
Congratulate me for what?
We just want what's best for Sandhya.
That's all.
Of course. Fortunately, what's best
for Sandhya is even better for you.
Aditya wants to start a restaurant?
Yes, that's what he hopes to do.
Now he wouldn't even need a loan.
I hope you and Shivendra
are on the same page.
Don't fight over this later.
Shivendra Bhai Sahab is not easy
to have an understanding with,
but... Rashmi and Usha have discussed it.
Anyway, it's only right that
the money stays within the family.
- And Sandhya has agreed to it, right?
- Yes. They've spoken to each other.
Now it's okay.
Have you lost your mind?
You agreed to marry Aditya?
- What?
- You're in quite a rush?
- Who told you?
- Everyone knows.
You could have at least asked me once.
He wants to marry me, Mom. Not you.
This is no time for mockery.
Don't be stupid.
He is not interested in you,
but your insurance money.
To start up his restaurant.
You just never want
to see me happy, do you?
Am I so worthless?
Will someone only love me if I have money?
Fine. Do what you want.
Now that you're such a grown-up.
I was just trying to look out for you.
- You're leaving tomorrow evening?
- If you want, I can leave right now.
Come along, Nazia,
I need help packing my bags.
Auntie, wait! I'm coming!
Bhabhi.
Yes, Alok.
Astik's laptop must be around here, right?
Yes, it's here.
It's probably of no use to you.
So can I take it?
Yes, take it.
The charger is kept next to it.
Take that as well.
Are you going
tomorrow morning as well, for the rituals?
Tomorrow is the wake.
I hope you remember that?
Everyone else seems
to have forgotten about it.
They seem to be preparing
for a celebration instead.
Bhabhi, why are you marrying him?
Bhabhi, please tell me.
Why are you marrying him?
Because he loves me.
No.
You know he does not truly love you.
And... you also know
who really does love you.
Alok... I'm your sister-in-law.
Alok...
What happened, Sandhya ji?
I need to discuss something with you.
Yes, I'm listening.
I think...
we should get to know each other
very well before we get married.
Unless we get to know each other...
how can we fall in love?
Like, I don't even know
what your favorite color is.
My favorite color is black. What's yours?
Blue.
[chanting and praying]
Put it in the fire.
Go ahead, Nazia.
We are quite open-minded
about such things.
The rituals are complete now.
Please offer your last offerings.
Grandma.
Grandma.
You know what I am about to do, don't you?
Fine, then. Listen.
You might be
the first to meet Astik in heaven.
Please explain this to him, all right?
I was just waiting until the wake.
And, Grandma, these 13 days
have turned my life upside down.
Everybody thought I had gone crazy.
But you know what?
When women become wise,
the world calls them mad.
Grandma, I have understood
the one thing that matters most.
If I don't take charge of my life...
others will always make decisions for me.
Whether I like it or not.
So something needs to change, Grandma.
Son. What's wrong?
Now... Where are you off to?
- I am leaving.
- What do you mean "leaving"?
What happened?
Why did Aditya leave like that?
- He has refused to get married to Sandhya.
- Why?
Sandhya is pregnant.
She is carrying Astik's child.
- Who said so?
- Sandhya herself told Aditya.
Sandhya never said anything to me.
She has been visiting the doctor.
We should have cared enough to know.
With the mourning period going on,
how could she tell us?
Give your blessings, Grandma.
I'll need it.
Take care of yourself, Grandma.
Ma, it's not possible.
She can't be pregnant.
Aditi, don't interfere in adult matters.
Just a minute, Ma. I'm 100% sure about it.
How come?
I'm on my period.
And yesterday, I ran out of sanitary pads.
So I asked Sandhya Bhabhi,
and she told me
she was on her period too.
She had one packet left,
but she still gave me two pads from it.
- You come with me outside.
- Just listen to me.
Aditi.
Dad, I'm sure you understand.
If Sandhya Bhabhi was on her period,
how could she be pregnant?
This is the result
of letting her watch Pad Man.
Everyone thinks they're Superman now.
Cinema has ruined this generation.
Let me go speak to Sandhya.
Nazia? Sandhya?
What happened?
Sandhya isn't in her room.
What is there to worry about it?
She must be downstairs. Let's check.
What is it?
It's a letter from Sandhya.
Addressed to you.
Mother, your sorcery worked.
The evil eye has vanished. I'm leaving.
And I am not pregnant.
You should've seen
Aditya's face when I told him I was.
He didn't love me.
I only lied to expose his lie.
You'd told me, Mother, that I am educated.
I can be self-dependent.
I am going to do just that.
Don't bother Dad.
I'll call you once I reach my destination.
Usha.
Mother-in-law,
I have a job interview tomorrow.
I'm leaving because the world is ready
to decide what's best for women,
but nobody stops for a second
to ask women.
Just like Astik has taken
a new form in these 13 days,
I have also found a new lease on life.
I know whatever you did,
you had my best interest at heart.
For that, I thank you.
Parchun, listen.
Where is Sandhya? She's not at home.
- I think she left with Nazia.
- See if she went outside. Go check. Quick.
- Okay.
- Hurry up.
I have left behind
the insurance money for Babaji.
The cheque is under Grandma's pillow.
He doesn't say it,
but I know he needs it more than I do.
Usha.
And, Amma,
now I will earn a living as well.
Please let Babaji know
that he need not worry about anything.
I will take care of him,
just like Astik did.
Sandhya.
I didn't think you'd come.
Sorry. I troubled you a lot.
No, you didn't. It's okay.
Today, I'm not
going to ask anything of you.
Instead I want
to return something that's yours.
- Any luck?
- We checked everywhere. No luck.
One minute, excuse me.
Alok...
Sharma Auntie's daughter
must've sent you a friend request.
Accept it.
Make sure to type carefully on chat.
Your English is terrible.
You will now need a new teacher...
as I am leaving...
to look for a job.
And, yes, I am taking
the laptop and charger.
I will need them now.
Where's my Pepsi?
I'm only kidding. Take care of yourself.
You too. Text me once you get there.
Yes, and I'll send you Parchun's number!
Give your heart away
Fulfill your wishes
These beautiful landscapes around you
They are all calling you
What will you say to your lovers?
Let your wishes be fulfilled
I will tell the whole world
Listen to my stories
What will you say to your lovers?
