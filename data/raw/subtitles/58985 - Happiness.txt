HAPPlNESS
They woke you up?
Maybe. Don't worry.
Lovely weather.
Beautiful Sunday!
They asleep?
Happy Father's Day.
- Again...
- Father's Day is all day long.
Do you think Mom's dress is beautiful?
Beautiful like Mom.
Come... Gisou.
The babies are sleepy.
Watch your foot!
Tell your Daddy ''Happy Day!''
Your Daddy Happy Day!
Thanks, sweetie. She's cute.
Sir, don't you want
to teII me something?
Like what?
Anything so Iong as you taIk.
You taIk so weII.
Where were we?
Yesterday, you were taIking about
the revoIution of species.
The evoIution...
What is the origin of organized Iife?
That is the question, as HamIet wouId say.
Good evening.
Hi, Uncle Jo.
- Had a good Sunday?
- Yes. You?
Great.
Beautiful salads.
Aren't they green!
- Father's Day, eh...
- Well, Uncle's Day too.
Here are my darlings.
Hi. Here. For you.
Keep them, my garden is full.
Give me a kiss, eh?
They're dirty and tired.
lt was beautiful out.
l'd like a kiss, little man.
He's not as sweet as Gisou
and he's a boy.
Stop, he'll talk back soon.
Today he said ''madeleine'' and ''train.''
He did? Try ''Hello, Aunt Madeleine.''
He's stubborn.
We had a nice day.
We stayed here watching TV
and had a short nap...
...until 5.
- Same for us.
- You too?
No, l went for a walk. l looked at them.
Well, everything's fine.
We have to go. Bedtime.
Let's go home, kids.
Want the car back tonight?
Don't bother. We never go out.
Tomorrow l'll go on the bus.
That's very sweet.
Take your flowers.
Good night, my little guy.
Good night, kitten.
- Good night, my dove.
- Good night, Daddy.
The countryside is beautiful.
l wonder what l like more:
The smell of the trees,
the grass or the river...
lt's ready!
Let's go!
Already noon?
Did you take Joseph's lunchbox too?
Sure, it's Monday.
- The game was great!
- l saw some of it on TV.
- Just when the goal of Reims...
- Great, but the referee was unfair.
Lunch inside or outside?
- Outside!
- No, inside!
- Heads or tails?
- Heads.
You win.
Where's Pierrot?
With Adèle, at the window.
He's visiting.
For candy, of course!
l want some too.
Come, you'll get some.
- Are you being good?
- He's adorable.
- Hello, Mrs. Chevalier.
- Hello.
- Getting married soon?
- That's why we're here.
Come on in, Mrs. Mercier.
We went to Paris
to find a ready-made dress.
But she liked nothing.
She's being difficult.
No, but ready-to-wear doesn't fit.
Nothing is in style.
l want what l saw in EIIe,
a dress with a short cape.
lf you can do that.
Yes. For when?
Saturday of next week.
lt's short but it'll do.
A long gown, l mean.
The time is short, not the dress.
Here's the sample.
We didn't know how many yards...
Here's the pattern.
Let's measure you.
- Will you wear heels?
- Of course.
Here is Daddy.
Hi, horse, hi, Dad.
Do you have sugar in your pocket?
- For the horse?
- Always.
- Hey horse, is it good?
- There you are!
Already here?
What a welcome! Hello everyone!
l meant glad to see you early.
That's how to speak to a husband.
Oh, miss is getting married?
Congratulations!
Our Yvette is leaving Fontenay...
For nearby: L'Haÿ-les-Roses.
Still in the roses then.
Better than Le Kremlin-Bicêtre.
Don't exaggerate.
Getting married is the thing.
The fitting is for next Monday, right?
And the cIoth is 20 feet?
I'II bring it tomorrow.
You're a Iifesaver.
How was your day, little guy?
What is ''day,'' Daddy?
When it's light out.
lt's the sun then.
Why did you say to Pierrot
how the sun is?
Why don't you come to me?
l'm coming.
You goofed.
Her husband is in Kremlin-Bicêtre,
in the Mercier Mausoleum.
lmagine a wedding in a mausoleum.
You're silly.
l'm hungry.
We'll eat in 5 minutes.
l'm going to Vincennes tomorrow.
Several days' work in a new building.
ls Uncle going with you?
He wants me to be on my own.
He wants to retire.
Dad, give me some bread.
As long as he takes care of the bills.
Post Office, please.
There, on the right.
34 Fontenay please, Miss.
Funny.
l'm moving to Fontenay soon.
l'm transferring you now.
Booth 1.
Fontenay 34, please.
You can speak.
Joseph? lt's me.
We have a problem.
The client forgot about the chimney.
lt's built. The closet doesn't fit.
Should l fix it here?
l'll take new measurements then.
Finished?
Not yet.
La Roche? Give me Noirmoutier.
We'll see you soon?
Early July.
Annie can come watch the kids
around 8:30.
We could make the 9:00 show.
l'd love it.
lf it's a Western, fine.
No horses in this one.
A French film, then.
With Bardot and Moreau
for the first time together.
Which one do you prefer?
Which woman?
Which woman? You.
l came back earlier,
but l'll make up the time tomorrow.
Come to the woodshop.
lt's a delivery from the wine store.
Cut the music.
We even deliver on holidays.
Here you go, John. Some rosé,
John's Day!
You're a great guy, real gold.
Like a father to me.
Get the glasses.
Gosh! Had to hurry from Vincennes
not to miss this.
Right on time.
lt's time.
Hey, big fiesta!
Let's drink and smoke.
Who's got a light?
Light and bonfire for St. John.
You've got enough wood now.
Give this to Aunt Thérèse.
Thanks.
Give this to Dad.
- Did you make the skewers?
- Two are ready.
This is gonna be good.
No flames... Skewers need coals.
ls it enough to cook, uncle?
Smoked meat is better,
like cowboys eat.
lndians eat the same.
lndians eat more spicy.
With peppers?
Red skin, red pepper!
Closed... He isn't home.
l'll bring the car in.
Wow! lt's a girl!
Oh, a girl!
- About 7 pounds.
- Born at 2:00 p.m.
''The key as usual. Please feed the kids.
l'll be back at 10:00.''
So you've got a sister.
- l wanted a brother.
- We have a niece at last.
l'll close the gate
so no one steals the kids.
Are there kidnappers?
No, l just want them to sleep quietly.
Gisou'll be happy in a couple of years.
l hope we will too.
What a pretty bird!
- Who is he?
- lt's John the Good.
The husband of Anna the Good Maid?
Miss...
Fontenay again?
No, today a Paris number.
Diderot 5613.
Mr. Chevalier, please. lt's his brother.
lt's you? Bravo!
Yes, we're happy.
''lsabelle''!
Nice name.
No, l'm on an outside job.
l wanted to send a telegram...
For a happy event?
l'm an uncle again. How much?
Nephews or the price?
The price. l've got two nephews,
a niece and two kids.
The kids are yours?
Forty cents.
Cheap for a family.
When will you be in Fontenay?
Early in July.
lt's soon.
l think l'll be a bit lost.
lt'll be a bed of roses.
ls a call for Tel Aviv expensive?
Very.
- l'm not eating with you today.
- All right.
l'll let you work.
By the way, where's the best coffee
around here?
At Le Château, not Le Castel.
What'll l do about my lunchbox?
l can give it to the lions
or the bears at the zoo.
Does your wife make honey?
You could say that.
She's nice and cooks well.
l could use another cup.
Waiter! Two coffees.
Doesn't she work?
She's a dressmaker.
And you?
Carpenter. Can't you tell?
Not from your face.
l don't smell of wood?
No, more like the woods.
That's good. l love the country.
Don't you?
l like it too.
But also movies and dancing.
l fear Fontenay might be kind of dead.
lt's sure quiet.
TEMPTATlON
MYSTERY
Why are you coming to Fontenay?
Somebody offered me an apartment.
A studio in a new building.
Thanks to my brother. He's in Africa
in the tires business
and l am in the wires business!
He arranged it for me for two years,
and he'll move in when he returns.
l'd rather live and work
at the same place.
So l requested my transfer.
l'll come back here on Saturdays
for dancing.
There's a dance hall in Fontenay
and two movie theaters,
no big coffee shops like here
but roses.
A fat lot of good that does me.
You don't have to worry about fat.
But let's have a walk.
Let's see the château.
- lnside or outside?
- lnside.
Outside.
Okay.
l can't stay long.
l have to get back to work.
Since you're a carpenter,
could you put up my shelves?
Sure l can. When?
l'm moving in on Saturday
with all my stuff.
l'll be there around 2 or 3.
lt's the white building on the square.
Paul Bert Avenue.
Number 4, entrance B,
5th floor on the right.
My name's Emilie Savignac.
Emilie, l love you.
l mean, l'm happy to know you.
Well...
Well what?
You're unbelievable.
Don't believe me...
...but l never lie.
- l have to go work. Shall we?
- Already? l still have time.
l'm gonna get some sun.
l'll stay here.
- Then l'll leave you.
- See you.
- On Saturday at 4:00.
- Remember the address?
Entrance B, 5th floor, left.
No, right. See you.
See you, Emilie.
l LOVE
This fabric is nice but slippery.
l'm getting nowhere.
And they want dresses for the girls.
They could have told you!
You know, at the last minute,
they thought of little bridesmaids.
l worked hard today.
Me too.
l finished in Vincennes,
l got two bottles of wine as a tip.
lt's a tough job painting this little garage.
Stop, you have time.
But hide it so Pierrot doesn't see it.
Look! lt'll be pretty.
lt's beautiful. Or it will be.
Be careful with the pins and the paint.
There isn't any on my fingers.
There's some on your shirt.
Don't worry.
lf you're mad, l'll spank you.
l wonder if l can finish
the dresses by Saturday.
Don't wear yourself out.
- Say no for the girls.
- l can't. They're nice, they've invited us.
Saturday afternoon. lt'll be fun
and l'll see how the gown looks.
Can't go, l accepted a job.
How sad.
You'll go with the kids.
l'll come later to get you.
Let's go to bed.
Me too.
Adèle! Look at the bride!
- lt was worth working so fast.
- She's gorgeous!
Lovely!
lt's worth a look.
See you this afternoon.
Around 3:00. l'll be alone.
My husband is working.
Will you lend me a picture to show him?
The bride is beautiful.
Come this way.
Squeeze in together. Smile.
Come together. Don't move.
Done!
Here it is.
l love you too.
l feel happy.
Be happy too, don't worry.
l'm free, happy,
and you're not the first.
Love me.
Such happiness!
Champagne!
To welcome the baby's arrival.
She's 8 days old.
Some champagne on her head!
l'll get her.
l'll go.
Empty your glasses first.
To health and family!
Can baby lsabelle drink some?
To the beautiful lsabelle!
To you, François!
lt tickles.
You want some cherries?
Baby's drinking.
Smile for me, little baby.
Look at me.
Are you quiet? Asleep?
Auntie, come see our house.
lt's nice.
ls it a dollhouse for lsabelle later?
lt's a trapper's cabin, for us.
- No girls allowed.
- Not even me?
You can do anything...
...except always carrying this one.
He must walk.
- l'm gonna take a break.
- We're in no hurry.
l like it when we're all together.
Where's Gisou?
Glued to the crib.
Soon she'll ask for a little sister.
l'd like many children
but let's wait a little.
l think so too.
l don't want you exhausted.
We need our time to rest together.
ls this resting together?
That too.
l came for the shelves.
l wondered if you'd come back.
l really did come for the shelves.
You can't live in here like this.
That true?
See, l want the closet against the wall
and a shelf on the top.
Don't sit here. l like you too much.
Sit over there while l work.
l need more shelves to do it.
Finished already?
For now, yes.
l'll finish in the next few days.
Can l come closer?
Tell me if l can help more.
A board and two trestles.
- You came back.
- You doubted me?
- You hadn't said anything.
- You couldn't tell?
l was afraid you'd say
the first time is a surprise,
the second time, it's habit.
Every day is a new day.
Are you happy at home too?
Very happy.
Your wife is not a habit?
No. l love her very much.
We get along, we have fun.
And there are the kids.
Surprises every day.
- And me?
- l met you and l love you.
Postwoman Terribly Tempting
Pensive Tender Thoughts
Passionate Time Together
Your François
You have to do it differently, sir.
Let me show you.
There...
You're good.
You too.
Have you ever been happy with a man?
Yes, once.
For three months.
Then he left me.
Then l waited for another happiness.
When you know, you're patient.
Were you sad?
Not that much.
l don't like sadness.
l was...
like... slightly aloof.
Now l'm here.
l'm myself, l mean.
l like that about you.
And it's the same for me.
l can't say...
...l'm different since l met you.
On the contrary, l'm even more myself.
You know, l met my wife
when l was in the service.
lt was love at first sight.
We married when l got out.
Had l met you first,
l'd live with you.
Sleeping together is fine
when you're in love.
But l met her first. l married her...
...and l love her.
She gave me joy.
Now l meet you...
l like you too. l love you too.
l have enough joy for both of you.
Happiness works by addition.
So you like having two women.
Maybe. l didn't look for it.
We won't be able to meet often.
Yes, but when we do, it's good...
...and apart, we can think about it.
We are together.
When l imagine you with your wife...
...it's rather unpleasant.
You know l love her, l can't lie.
Not my fault if you came second.
That's the way it is.
But we're lucky to know each other...
- ...and be alive.
- That's true.
- l love you.
- Me too.
Tell me one thing...
Are she and l the same to you?
No, very different.
You make love better, you have fun.
lt's like a new wine for me.
My head is spinning
and your pleasure is in your heart.
Like with Thérèse.
She likes making love too
but she's calmer.
l'm the one who leads the game.
She likes me to have fun with her.
She's tender...
...always there...
...and our kids look like her.
You see, l'm being honest.
You taught me another game,
we're more alike.
Thérèse is like a hardy plant.
You're like an animal set free.
l love nature.
Quite a speech!
Do you understand?
l understand ''French'' and ''François.''
Some people look bored on Sundays.
They must prefer the factory.
They must look the same on weekdays.
A new client came yesterday.
Ugly and fat, mean-looking.
You should have said you were too busy.
l said so.
l saw myself sadly sewing for her.
l could see you
pricking her to deflate her.
l was afraid so l said no.
You're wonderful, always doing
what l'd like you to do.
Except rice with chocolate.
We can't have it every day.
What l love, l can have every day.
Radishes, fried potatoes, rice...
And you as a second dessert.
Every day you have me.
Desserts mustn't be the same.
She was dreaming.
She's in love... thoughtful.
With one of us?
l would have told you.
Who then?
l won't say.
You know me, l don't like mysteries.
But love is secret.
Even her little heart is hidden.
lt just doesn't match any brooch.
Will we meet him?
No. lt's different.
l like to go out with you.
Nothing more.
She'll tell me.
Let's dance anyway.
Hasn't the baby changed?
She's bigger and cute.
Auntie is crazy about her.
She'll love her as much as Gisou.
Daughters and dolls...
Hi, boss!
l love dolls too.
Saturday l met one, a ''Dalida''
minus the accent.
- You're a real rabbit.
- One has to burn when he has sideburns.
You could use a guitar.
ln romance, l can sing duets.
As long as l can change my partner.
l'd rather have one only, a good one.
You're too young to get one.
After you get one, you'll want many.
Unless you're like François.
He doesn't look unhappy.
l like fidelity.
The same woman, your whole life?
Your wife's wonderful, but...
Well, l'm not capricious.
When l love, l can't stop.
Come on, guys!
You're young, okay, but...
What about working? lt's Monday.
You have to earn your pension.
For old people, l feel the same.
l loved my father.
l don't think of him very often,
but l love him.
He's here. lt goes on...
lt's crowded here.
ln such a big place, l feel less alone.
- l go back to work at 1:00.
- Me too.
Just to make sure it's real.
- lt's the same if l pinch you.
- Not quite.
Do you really love me?
- What?
- You said ''love.''
lt must be true even when l'm asleep.
What time is it?
Nine. The weather's fine.
The kids have had breakfast.
Kiss me if there's no coffee.
- A kiss or coffee?
- Everything.
You're lucky. l have both.
Are we going to the country?
François, drink your coffee.
Gisou, you're in my way.
Go over there.
Go play.
- They're sleepy.
- Wait...
lsn't it nice?
This is the best spot.
- l can't think about winter.
- Don't.
Actually, l don't... l feel very happy.
You look happy these days.
Even more than usual.
- Does it show?
- Oh, yes. What is it? Summer?
Come on, babies, naptime.
Time to sleep.
What makes you so happy?
lt's more happiness.
lt's hard to explain.
You may not understand.
- l don't want to hurt you by sharing it.
- Hurt me?
You're right, l'm clumsy.
Speak to me.
Let's drop it.
l can understand.
l'm not that stupid.
That's not what l meant, love.
l don't like lying.
- Are you sad?
- l don't know. l'm listening.
Don't be sad. lt's simple.
You and l and the kids,
we're like an apple orchard,
a square field.
Then l notice an apple tree
that grows
outside the field
and blooms with us.
More flowers, more apples.
lt adds up, you know.
ls there somebody
who loves you like l do?
Not like you.
Are you in love too?
Yes. lt just happened
and it gave me such joy.
How long have l
not been alone with you?
A month.
But don't talk that way.
Am l different with you?
Less kind? Less loving?
You're the only one l love.
l'm your wife.
l love you.
Look at me.
l love you.
lt's like if l had ten arms to hug you
and you ten arms for me.
We're all mixed together.
But l found myself with extra arms.
- l'm taking nothing from you, see?
- And she's not jealous?
She knows l love you.
She doesn't want to take anything.
You won't live with her?
Oh, no. Do you understand?
lt's difficult. lt's so new.
lf it hurts you...
...l'll do what you want.
lf you ask me to do without her,
l'll do it.
l want you to be happy.
You and the kids.
You and l.
You first.
You know...
...it's too bad to deprive oneself
of life and love.
lf you could love me the same...
Even more if you wish.
Maybe... Yes... l think l could.
You could?
- How much do you love me?
- Even more, since you're so happy.
My love!
lmagine a blanket of herbs
and walls of leaves.
That way we'd be all alone.
Mom, l've slept enough.
Where's Mom? ln the woods?
- l don't know. l just woke up.
- Let's find her.
Excuse me. Have you seen
a blond with a blue dress?
No, mister.
l wasn't paying attention.
- Seen a blond woman in blue?
- A young woman, yes.
A blue dress with some yellow in it?
She walked by, holding flowers.
- A young blond lady?
- What?
A blue and yellow dress.
Look... What's happening there?
François can't keep them.
How would he manage?
l'm able to raise my daughter's children.
You live too far away, it's not possible.
We could do it too.
You're a son to us.
Easier if they come with us.
Three or five! They know each other.
We love them already.
lf l take Gisou, you the kid...
We can't separate them.
lt's not that we don't want Gisou...
Uncle is right.
lf François agrees, we'll take them.
l'll be able to see them on Sundays.
Even in the evening on weekdays.
They are my children.
l know, it's terrible.
l'll go with the kids early August.
- Who are they with?
- My brother and his wife.
We're going to the Loire.
- And you?
- l'll come back.
Back to work in September. And you?
l'm here.
l'm happy and unhappy.
Can we put the radio on?
- Can l put the radio on?
- Sure!
You!
You bought a table.
And a record player.
l thought about you a lot.
lt was a long summer for me.
l thought about you a lot too.
l still want to be happy...
...if you're willing.
One thing l'm afraid of
is to take someone else's place.
l loved you both.
l miss Thérèse very much
and l love you.
That's not all.
The kids... l'd like you to love them.
l saw them. They're pretty.
- Maybe you don't want to marry.
- Doesn't matter.
You're my happiness.
You and your life.
l want you...
...but not at night... here.
May l come tomorrow after work?
l'll be here at 6:00.
lt's still daytime.
What about Sunday?
We'll go to the forest if you want.
Emilie, l brought some wood.
l'll make you a house.
l'll let you tame them.
l'm going for a walk.
