This rusted monster in front of me
is an AN-M64 left over from the Korean War.
Turn the trigger using
a pipe wrench then slowly...
remove it.
Can you keep it down, man?
I'm working here.
An unexploded bomb is called
that because it never exploded,
and I've never heard of a dud going off
"Tae-sik is ugly."

in my entire career at EOD.
In my entire career at EOD.
What's with him today?
Probably pre-discharge jitters.
I don't know why we
even bother wearing this.
It's thick but it doesn't keep you warm.
Still working.
Of course.
If you think about it,
there's no job safer than ours.
Ji-young just doesn't get that.
Well, you're not coming out
to the field anymore.
I feel like...
I'm forgetting something today.
The team dinner tonight?
Ah, of course! I hope we're not
eating at The Great Wall again.
We're eating at The Great Wall.
I'm telling you, Professor Min
has a share in that place.
But that's not it. There
was something else...
Your husband is running late again?
I don't know. Maybe he got called to a job.
How come you won't tell me?
You're really going to make me
wait until the 32nd week?
That's the law.
You'd think this was a
courthouse, not a hospital.
Not much patience left now?
So is it a little prince or princess?
Captain CHO - 12 Missed Calls
Hey, cutie cute!
So tell me, boy or girl?
I'm sorry,
do I know you?
Come on, baby.
I'm almost there, right around the corner.
Did you get called out on a job?
Um... no?
How come you never tell me when
you're called out to the field?
Because it makes you worry.
I knew you got called out.
From now on, they won't
call me even if I want to go.
Now, what did the doctor say? Tell me.
Tell you what?
About our precious little...
Oh, the doctor.
I can't say because you were late again.
- The bastard said that?
- It's a she.
A girl? Really?
No, the doctor is a she.
Oh... Well, that sucks...
I'm getting in the elevator.
I'll tell you when you
get home. Over and out.
- But...
- Over and out.
Now, our YTN correspondent
live in Pyongyang.
I'm at the 425 Cultural Center where
the Workers' Party
Congress is taking place.
High-level officials are present
for the completion of the
denuclearization program,
which will be confirmed and
officially announced today.
USS Watson will arrive at
Chongjin Port on the 16th
to collect the last 6 remaining ICBMs.
This action will showcase
complete denuclearization...
As I speak, we're
experiencing an earthquake!
The Cultural Center is being destroyed!
I repeat...
Oh, God! The 4256 Cultural Center
has collapsed!
"WARNING: 7.8 quake occurred.
Beware aftershocks."
Ji-young!
God...
Breaking news.
Baekdu Mountain has erupted.
It's magnitude 8, the
highest eruption class.
"Maximum Eruption Class is VEI-8"
YTN has exclusive footage.
This disaster is estimated
to be of unprecedented scale.
The earthquake has been confirmed as a 7.8.
The entire Korean peninsula falls
within the quake's influence.
Has announced a National Disaster.
Evacuation orders have been issued
in Seoul, Gyeonggi, Gangwon.
Experts warn of more explosions to come.
With all airways blocked, major
roads have also been destroyed.
The city of Pyongyang has burned to ashes
and fallen into a state of anarchy.
The Chinese government is mobilizing
military around the Korea-China border
under the tag of risk management.
The White House has issued a strong
warning to China's military movement and,
as of 10AM KST, has announced
an evacuation order
for US citizens in Korea.
Professor Kang Bong-rae?
Robert... I'm Robert...
and no longer a professor.
I just handed in my resignation.
I'm Jun Yoo-kyung, Senior
Secretary to the President.
What're you here for?
Your advice.
Took you long enough.
I'm sorry, but I have to
go. The evacuation order.
I'm a US citizen. See the eagle?
Why is this...
Come on...
May I?
You're strong. Impressive.
Well, have a good day.
I read the thesis you
published 3 years ago.
And haven't I warned you ever since?
Yet all I got was a laugh and
the nickname "Professor Hot Air".
And now you want my advice.
The dean of this university is being
tried on embezzlement charges.
I can issue an order prohibiting your
departure because you are a key witness.
Are you trying to blackmail me?
Yes, I am, and I'll do more if necessary.
I just need 3 hours of your time. Please.
There are 4 magma chambers under Baekdu.
The remaining 3 chambers
will explode consecutively,
following the first, which
has already exploded.
How much time do we have?
This is an estimated
timeline for the eruptions.
The scale of the second and third
explosions may be relatively weak.
The real problem is the last eruption.
Successive eruptions are certain,
but the last will trigger an 8.0
earthquake on the Richter scale,
exerting damage over 48%
of the Korean peninsula.
Professor Kang from Princeton University.
Oh, damn.
So, this stems from my simulation of
various rock layers over the last 3 years.
In the case of a 600-kiloton
artificial explosion
within a 5km radius of the chamber,
it's estimated the pressure of the chamber
could be reduced by 45%
with a 3.48% probability.
What does that mean?
Let me...
Can I... Thanks...
To put it simply,
such strong explosion can lower
the pressure of the chamber.
You collapse the ground around the chamber
and make a passage for the
pressure to decompress.
It requires an extremely precise
calculation of distance and density,
which is what I've been
working on for the past 3 years.
Of course, it's currently only a theory.
It's not like I can just
dig a tunnel or something.
First Deputy Director of the
Intelligence Service will debrief.
There is a total of 12 mines around Baekdu.
These underground mines are so complex
even the workers often get lost.
They don't match the ideal conditions
of Professor Kang's research,
but we should consider if any of
these mines are worth examining.
Mine 9 has a pit estimated at 3.5km deep.
It's a copper mine?
That's correct.
Interesting. See, the
density of copper is...
Did you say an induced explosion
of 600 kilotons? That scale of...
Yeah. You need nuclear fission.
Did you just say 'nuclear'?
Are you suggesting executing a nuclear
explosion at the Korea-China border?
- How can you say such a thing?
- It's throwing gasoline on fire!
Do you even hear yourself?
We've lost all contact with North Korea.
We've got no partner to work on this with.
All we can do is wait for the
disaster to hit then react.
What would you do if
you were me, Professor?
Would you play the odds
on a wild plan like yours?
Sir, if I were you, I'd do nothing.
Rather than missing the target point
and disturbing the magma chamber,
it would be wiser to
wait and brace for impact
and face a disaster.
My plan has a 3.48% success probability.
It's practically impossible.
3.48%...
I've heard that number before.
That's what my poll was
when I first announced
I was running for president.
But I thought
1% is already in the realm of possibility.
I got 42.7% of the vote in the end.
Professor Kang, work on
getting that success percent up.
Well... um... sir...
it's not exactly something you just get up.
Even if you calculated
a precise target point,
you'd still need a nuclear
explosion of 600 kilotons.
And where could we acquire that?
If we had no other
choice, we could steal it.
The USS Watson is scheduled to arrive
At 4PM on the 16th.
We need to get our hands on those warheads
before the US does.
Mobilize an NSC.
Yes, sir.
3 years in Afghanistan, Foal Eagle
and Key Resolve exercises,
12 cycles completed in total... Impressive.
We're giving you a mission.
Report to base immediately.
Sorry? I'm awaiting discharge.
Shut up.
You completed a Key Resolve course
on disarming ICBMs, correct?
Only in training, sir.
I've never actually seen an ICBM.
For that, I'd have to go to...
North Korea?
Captain Cho...
I can put your family on the
US citizen evacuation list.
You know all the railways
and highways are destroyed.
Where will you go with
a pregnant wife? How?
Cutie cute, it's Thursday at 3.
You'll go to the meeting point then
we'll go to Incheon Port together.
You can't be late for that.
I'll quickly finish the job
then join you.
Are you worried about something?
- Should I be?
- Of course not.
Well, I'm not because you'll
make sure I don't have to be.
You said it's a quick job
and not a dangerous one.
So everything's fine.
Yeah, right.
But...
I have to know something before I go.
Hello? Anybody in there?
I'm dying to know if it's
a boy or girl. Just in case.
In case what?
Just in case what?
Nothing. I mean, you can
tell me after I get back.
In-chang.
What?
In-chang!
It makes me nervous when
you call me by my name.
Can't you call me babe or something?
I need you to make me a promise.
Okay.
If you keep it, I'll forgive you
for the promises you didn't keep.
Okay.
- Don't be late.
- Okay.
Be there in time to
meet our baby in person.
Okay.
- Say I promise.
- I promise.
I will be there.
Tens of thousands of refugees are
traveling the broken road on foot.
"Osan Air Base"
These 6 ICBMs were the last
negotiation cards for North Korea
and have been kept under the radar.
As you can see, they're kept in
a place undetectable by satellites.
So in order to get a more exact location,
we turned a North informant to our
side before denuclearization began.
Ri Jun-pyong,
a secretary at the North
Korean Embassy in Beijing.
That's his title by cover.
He is actually a
specially trained operative
under the Ministry of
People's Armed Forces.
Ri managed to locate the warheads,
but his cover was blown.
Now, he's being held
in a detention facility.
A GPS tracker was planted
on Ri in case this happened.
The goal of this operation is to
contact Ri and secure the warheads.
Gentlemen...
set your watches to countdown.
This is the time remaining
until the final eruption.
This operation is, in
principle, non-lethal,
but we are violating the non-aggression
pact by crossing the demarcation line
without being invited.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
I have a question, sir.
What's the status of the mine?
Is it possible to infiltrate?
The technical team won't enter the mine.
Hey...
You'll only install the uranium
- in the detonator.
- What?
I'm counting on you to do your duty.
This is the detonator.
It's an empty shell now, but once uranium
is installed, it's a whole different thing.
This is the most lightweight
form of a nuclear weapon.
It's only a prototype, so the timer
cannot be stopped once started.
The principals will handle the detonation,
so you technicals don't need to worry.
Let's move on to separating the uranium
and attaching it to the detonator.
Everyone get a protective suit.
Protective suits!
Wow, look at them.
We're both special ops, but
they've got a different aura.
Can you at least keep in step?
Yes, sir!
Sorry.
"Command Headquarters"
Any problems?
No, sir. All clear.
Alpha One moving to runway.
Delta One moving to runway.
Approve take off.
Alpha One, take off approved. Climb.
Current speed 209, altitude 1,000.
We just crossed the demarcation line.
2200 hours, concentration 2,564.
Levels are higher than anticipated.
The silicone in the volcanic ash
might stop the engine.
Increase altitude.
Yes, sir. Increase altitude.
These rubber bullets cramp my style.
- Tae-sik?
- Yes.
Our job is to fly 300km, dismantle
some missiles, then come back.
Shooting guns and zapping tasers
are for the guys in the other plane.
Don't remind me.
- Alpha One
- What was that?
One of your engines has quit! Initiate APU!
What the...
Out of the way!
Is that smoke?
Move over.
Get away from me.
What's going on, man?
It's dropping altitude fast.
The remaining engines can't hold.
It can't withstand the weight.
They have to jump now.
2800, 2500, 2100...
Dropping fast!
Prepare to jump.
Get your parachute!
- You mean now?
- What the hell is happening?
Are we even in North Korea?
You guys need to calm down.
My chute! Where's my chute?
You're wearing it! Get your shit together!
Everyone, put your masks on! Go!
What are you doing? Jump!
Go! Jump! Now!
Come in, Alpha One! Alpha One, come in!
It's gone silent, sir.
What about the tech team?
They completed the jump.
Who's the commander there?
You okay, man?
- Captain, you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everyone else?
Captain, it's command.
Captain Cho In-chang.
Do you have Alpha One's crash point?
I'm not... I'm not sure but...
Yes, I see it.
Locate and retrieve the black bag.
Come back!
Hey, you idiot!
My name's Captain Cho, sir!
Then listen up, Captain!
Go get the black bag!
There's a map of the mines
and a GPS tracker in it.
Secure the bag no matter what. Understood?
Sir, yes, sir.
What's going on, man?
We're colossally fucked...
Shit...
I think I found it. You get the firearms.
Okay.
Dammitt! Dammitt!
We have to go now!
I mean it! Let's go!
- Come on.
- Okay, okay! I got it!
Hurry!
Captain, did you get the bag?
Yes, sir. Bag retrieved.
Good job. Any survivors on the Alpha team?
No survivors, sir.
Follow the GPS tracker
to the detention center.
Locate and secure Ri Jun-pyong.
Requesting backup, sir.
We'll stand by until they arrive.
There is no backup.
All air routes have
been blocked due to ash.
Land entry is impossible.
You're the only team that can
carry out this mission now.
Captain Cho, as of right now,
you are in charge of this operation.
Upon securing the nuclear weapons,
move to the final explosion point.
Is this for real?
Are we actually in North Korea?
We can do this... We can do this...
It's not so bad if you think about it, no?
No...
We were going to
dismantle the missile anyway.
Now, we're just going a little
further, entering a mine,
and setting off a detonator. That's all.
You understand what that means,
right? We can do this, right?
Our job is to diffuse bombs,
not detonate them...
especially nuclear ones...
Be it nuclear or not, we just
have to set off a timer.
It's not like it's a suicide mission.
Shit!
What is it?
It... slipped.
You crazy bastard! What
the hell are you doing?!
Rubber bullets can
be lethal at close range!
What are you, a damn boy scout?
- Sorry...
- Get your act together! All of you!
Put your helmets on.
How long has it been since you shot a gun?
Shooting...
I think... about a year.
Did you expect to just walk in there?
Looks like we can just walk in there.
All those people are fleeing.
It's a riot. All security
seems to have been killed.
G-g-good... It's going as planned.
But something's not right.
Ri isn't showing any movement.
Let me see it.
Ri survived execution by
leaking intel about us.
It's possible he is currently a double spy.
Consider him extremely dangerous
and don't let your guard down.
Ri Jun-pyong!
I ain't over there.
Really? Y'all are just a bunch of kids.
Very simple.
Ri has a Southern accent?
Doesn't look like the guy in our picture.
Are you Jun-pyong Ri?
You judge people by the way they talk?
I say don't judge a person by his words
but by his actions.
If I spoke Russian, would
that make me Russian?
Don't rely on what I say. Just trust
that beeping device you got there.
Ri Jun-pyong, First Secretary
under MPAF in Beijing...
Our agency has all of your information.
An agent whose code name is...
whose code name...
The Great Wall'. You know him, right?
So you better not try anything.
What're you standing round for then?
Open this thing up.
We decide whether we open the door
or not. Sergeant Min, open the door.
Officer Kim, open the door.
That's right. Kim, open the door.
Come on, Kim. Hop to it.
Just a moment.
Mr. Ri, there's going to be a
small explosion. Please step back.
Officer Kim.
Fire in the hole!
Did you check the batteries?
I did.
Try again.
Fire in the hole!
Why doesn't it work?
Give it to me.
Are you okay?
Wow, the air sure is different out here.
I need a shower.
Shower?
So you wanna find some warheads,
set them off in a mine in Yongsuri,
Yes.
And try to stop a volcanic eruption?
Exactly.
You gotta be kidding me. You think
you're some kinda... what's it called...
"Science Ninja Team Gatchaman"?
What's that make you, the Owl?
How dare you call him an owl?
This is why capitalism is doomed.
It allows too much imagination.
You only have to take us to the warheads.
We'll release you upon
reaching the location.
You'll release me?
Take a seat. Please.
Let's talk this out.
The Great Wall' must have
told you crazy things about me.
- Ri!
- Freeze!
Mr. Ri, if you want, we can help you
become a South Korean citizen.
If you do, the Korean government is sure
to give you an apartment in Gangnam.
What do Gangnam properties cost now?
It ain't gonna shoot if the safety's on.
So... Can I shower or what?
Lower your guns, lower them!
Lower the guns.
Now...
- Lieutenant Han.
- Sir.
We switch to plan B.
If we take Route 8, we get
10 minutes extra, right?
- Excuse me?
- Let's do this by the books.
Mr. Ri,
I'll give you 10 minutes,
but if you behave like that again,
we can't guarantee your safety.
Go on.
What kinda safety is there in Hell?
Outta the way, Owl.
Bastard...
Everyone, gather around.
You handled that well.
Owl and Tae-sik, keep your eyes on him.
- Owl...
- I'll confer with headquarters.
This is good. Everything's
going as planned.
What plan is he talking about?
"Near the city of Hamheung"
I ain't used soap in a while. Feels so dry.
Anybody got lotion?
We're headed to Hamheung, right?
That's where the ICBMs are kept?
Would you look at that?
Whatta sight...
The Great Leader finally on his back.
I always felt bad looking down
on him from my apartment.
Thanks.
What're those?
Gimme one.
Man, it's sour!
Oh, sour and sweet.
I ain't had something like this
in so long it makes my jaw hurt.
Hey.
Yeah?
Wait a minute...
- What is it?
- Where's my wallet?
- Your wallet?
- Check under the seats.
What, lose your kid or something?
You can't let them outta your sight.
That's why parents need eyes
in the back of their heads.
Where's the map?
Was it important?
Because I ate it.
What?
Don't worry. I got it saved up here.
I reckon everybody needs insurance.
You crazy son of a bitch!
Hey, hey!
You gotta hell of a punch.
Shut your hole!
Tae-sik, enough.
You better hope these cuffs stay on
because you're dead if they don't.
If we go through Hamheung like
Ri suggests, we'll save an hour.
Are you frying to advertise
you're there to steal a nuke?
I'm sorry, sir.
Take a detour.
You must get to the site before
the next eruption, got it?
Yes, sir.
He didn't have to shout...
Be quick and no funny business.
Like what?
I swear, this guy...
I can't believe this...
Jeez.
Gotta light?
You gotta light?
What're you saying?
I asked for a light, shithead.
Here.
Oh, shit!
What an asshole.
Damn, I'm tired.
Let's get going!
Yes, sir.
I want to apologize on
behalf of Mr. Park earlier.
Never mind.
I'd rather he say shit to my
face than behind my back.
I knew the republic would fall
but sure didn't expect this.
For a traitor, you're sentimental.
Didn't you hear?
It takes sentiment to betray.
Will you pinch it off already?
Sure.
Seriously...
Did your dumb-ass forget?
I told you about these cuffs.
What's taking so long?
Wait. You sent Tae-sik alone?
He's not back yet?
No, sir.
Where is he at?
Right here.
What about Ri? The GPS!
He's stationary.
Shit!
Tae-sik! Tae-sik!
Tae-sik!
Hey! Open your eyes!
Where's Ri?
Where did he go?
The GPS...
"Hamheung"
Wait.
Move.
Where the hell is he at?
How are we going to find him?
Been a long time.
Ri Jun-pyong?
I had myself some surprise visitors.
You're gonna laugh when I tell you who.
The area is too big. We need to split up.
What if Ri passed through here?
No, he wanted to come here.
He must have a reason.
We'll never find him.
Hold on...
Where are you going?
The Great Leader finally on his back.
I always felt bad looking down
on him from my apartment.
I didn't think I'd see you
again till I was dead.
Where's Sun-ok?
Bocheon.
At my brother's.
Bocheon?
That's right in front of Baekdu.
How could you send a little girl to...
How cute. You're trying to be a father.
I'm gonna ask you this one last time.
Did you
rat me out?
Yes, I did.
He's close.
10 o'clock, upper level. Let's go.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Where were you gonna go after
abandoning your own daughter?
Did you forget?
You abandoned us first.
Ri Jun-pyong.
Put the gun down.
Shoot me.
I don't have long left anyway.
Put the gun down now!
See you in Hell.
Nam, the cuffs.
Yes, sir.
Did I scare you good?
I'm done with your bullshit.
Ooh, a tough guy.
Come on then. There ain't much time.
Let's go.
US citizens in Korea are
gathering at local meeting points.
Included in the evacuation list are
Korea-based US military and their families,
US citizens, and Koreans
who obtained US approval.
Don't worry, sweetie.
Mommy can do this.
Mommy can do this for us.
Let's go see daddy.
"27th Machinery Complex
Kanggye, Chagang Province"”
All security has left save a skeleton crew.
After Tae-sik clears with sniping,
get in position and cover the team.
The rest of us will enter...
What's the plan?
I'm telling them now.
So you're making shit up?
For crying out loud...
Cover the enemy's eyes first.
That closed factory is a cover.
The actual facility is underneath.
But what happens if you kill the generator?
Y'all got night vision goggles?
It takes 2 minutes for the
emergency generator to start.
- So you best move fast.
- Yes, sir!
I'll say this only once.
I'm in charge here.
Then make the call.
Gather around, everyone.
Actually, his plan is
pretty similar to mine.
First of all, Tae-sik...
you'll find the generator and shut it down.
The rest of you will enter
through the main gate.
Yes, sir!
Sir, you told me to handle sniping.
You can't do that after you
shut down the generator?
Is sniping even
necessary in this situation?
Sniping would be good to have.
Yeah?
That's some rare leadership.
Unit 2 is inside basement 1.
Tae-sik, the generator! Now!
Nope, that's not it...
Return fire!
Return fire!
Have we located the hostiles?
At your 11 o'clock but
their numbers are unknown!
We're engaging!
Why aren't the lights off yet?
Tae-sik! Tae-sik!
Shut down the goddamn generator!
Dammit...
The circuit breaker!
Captain, basement 2 electricity is down!
Why's it still on here?
You've got 2 minutes!
Unit 2 has cleared basement 2!
Hostiles contained!
I'm on my way!
Give me a gun!
What? I can't give you a gun!
You want us both to die here?
Oh, damn it.
You take that side.
What's the kill range for rubber bullets?
How would I...
Comrades!
I'm Major Ri Jun-pyong of MPAF!
I just killed a commander of
the South Korean puppet army!
Come and look!
That went better than I expected.
How can you just shoot me without
warning? What kind of plan is that?
Scared the shit out of me...
Come on in.
No more messing around.
What's the date?
Is that the password?
How could that be
password? I just wanna know.
I got no idea how long
I was in that shit hole.
Hold on.
Gotcha again.
Grab the gear.
Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Comrades, let me introduce you
to the treasures of the republic.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
So sleek and beautiful.
But you Southies still call them
the mistake of the republic.
A big one, too.
What's the radioactive reading?
0.128 sievert.
Good, thank you. Let's get to work.
What are y'all doing?
Did you forget about my insurance?
Just stay put for a minute.
Bring it over here.
Perfect fit.
Hang in there.
You promised to release me!
Sneaky sonsabitches!
Begin disassembly.
Extracting warhead from propellant.
Separating uranium casing.
Radioactive reading?
8.6, 8.8... And rising.
Separating the core.
Mounting on 1 and 2, complete.
Mounting on 4, complete.
It's the second eruption! We need to hurry!
Ensure safety then
everyone back to position!
It's sooner than expected!
"DISASTER WARNING:
Paldang Dam has collapsed."
Oh my!
Hey! The doors are closing!
Look here!
What's wrong?
This bolt is stuck.
Then force it.
Look!
We have to skip this one!
Yes, let's skip this.
Don't we need all of them?
The plan only works with all 6 nukes!
Assholes!
Are you crazy? We could all die!
It's all we got!
Hello.
We obtained a go ahead from above.
I'll let you cross with your daughter.
Bring the detonator and a technician
who can disassemble it.
Hello? Hello?
Thank God.
Finish it up.
- Yes, Captain.
- Hurry.
Where is Ri?
We can't wait any longer!
Ri, that bastard!
You cuffed him properly?
Yes!
- You should've double checked!
- I did!
Did I scare you?
What the hell, man?
Funny how fate works.
- Get the gear! Quick!
- If I'd left, you would've been trapped.
- But I jammed a barrel between the doors so...
- Load up and go!
Everyone okay?
Yes, sir!
I'm fine too.
The detonator?
It's fine.
Let's go.
Perfectly fine... you heartless asshole.
It's Delta One!
- Connect him.
- Yes, sir!
Captain Cho, how did it go?
We secured them.
We got all 6 installed
in the detonator, sir.
Well done.
But the second eruption
happened during the operation.
Is everything okay on that side?
My wife, Ji-young...
The eruption occurred sooner than expected.
We'll update the new estimated time
for the last eruption. You must hurry.
Where...
Are you comfortable down there?
We got it all wrong.
80% of the deposit in mine 7 is iron ore.
It's an iron fortress that
can contain anything.
Your point?
The speed... Ouch!
The velocity of the eruption was faster
than estimated. The temperature soared.
At this rate, the third eruption will tip
the temperature over the fusing point.
That iron fortress is softening.
See?
The volcano's changing.
That's her weak point.
If we can hit that point,
53 %!
With the 7th mine,
we can stop the final explosion.
Who would've guessed my timely
judgment would save our lives?
Will you please get up?
This thing's very dangerous.
Careful.
Ri.
We go our own ways now. Give me the map.
I ain't ready to cancel my insurance yet.
I told you enough with the bullshit.
Give me the map now.
Did you check your safety?
I'll be damned.
There is some man in you.
Rubber bullets are fatal at this
range, so stop fucking around.
Can you do this without the map?
Take cover!
You can thank me later!
Don't hold your breath!
Lieutenant Han, did you load the detonator?
Yes, sir!
Good! Return fire!
Yes, sir!
Come on!
Hurry! Careful!
Dammitt!
This is Delta One!
What's going on?
We're taking fire!
From North Koreans?
Can't be sure.
Permission to use live ammo.
Granted.
Tae-sik, secure visual!
Yes, sir!
Take cover!
Come in, Tae-sik!
Min!
Tae-sik is down!
He's losing a lot of blood!
Secure retreat and get him out of there!
- Yes, sir.
- I'll go!
Direct hits.
They have heat detectors.
Who are they?
I don't know, man.
What the...
I'm going for the truck. Cover me.
Don't tell me to cover you or... shit!
Crazy assholes!
Dammitt!
- You hurt?
- I'm okay.
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.
Min, get ready!
Yes, sir!
Retreat! Retreat!
Everyone, fall back!
Over here!
Get in! Quick!
Hurry!
Where's my team?
This is gonna hurt.
Huh?
Ambassador...
Do you expect us to sit idly by
and watch this disaster happen?
I need you to calm
down and think of a way...
Forget it. I'm due to leave,
and I got nothing keeping me here.
There's nothing keeping you here?
Well, I've got so much that
I was prepared to do anything,
even beg a US citizen, for help.
I was clearly out of my mind.
It all came to this because of an incompetent
government that can't decide its own fate,
and you're part of that! Okay?
The damn...
the doors are locked! Unlock the doors!
Tae-sik... come on...
Don't worry.
The package is wrapped and en route.
Bocheon, 8 o'clock.
Why Bocheon?
I got business there.
Don't forget the package
is payable on delivery.
You're awake?
You know why you ain't got eyes
in the back of your head?
What are you talking about?
So you don't look back.
Why did you put these on me?
Come on, uncuff me.
What are you doing?
Get these off me.
Ti... coo... ti...
What is cootie coot?
- What?
- You kept mumbling
that in your sleep.
Having nightmares?
Cutie cute.
Uncuff me, and I'll tell you what it means.
You're such an idiot...
The border is lined with Chinese military
ready to charge in at
the first provocation.
I have evidence and witness to
a violation of non-aggression.
They're gonna be so happy to see you.
We're going to Bocheon
where I'll serve you up
on a silver plate. Got it?
You're out of your damn mind!
You can't do that now!
It'll be the end for everyone!
It's been the end for a long time.
No, I mean the final hour! There will
be 2 more eruptions in 17 hours!
If we don't stop them, it's over
for the North and the South!
So let me out of here!
I don't care about the South, and
it's long been over in the North.
Oh, shit.
They need to go to mine 7 instead.
We need to regain access to
our comms with the team.
What can we possibly do
after violating US alliance?
They broke our trust too.
Chance of success was low anyway.
It's 53% now.
That's higher than your approval rating.
I'm sorry.
The shell...
Thank you, Tae-sik.
Hey, cookie cooties...
Yeah?
You watch Damo?
What?
The South Korean TV show.
I missed the final episode.
It was killing me while I was locked up.
Oh! Damo! Of course!
What happens to Chae-ok and Bo-yoon?
Do you know?
I haven't seen that show.
But maybe Jewel in the Palace
is a better choice for you.
Then again, My Love from the Star
was pretty popular.
But I don't know because
I only watch Am-shows.
What's that?
It's short for American TV shows.
Ah, American TV show, Am-show...
Yep!
You Southies contract everything.
We call it "con-every".
Huh?
That's f-mad.
Fucking mad. I contracted that.
You're catching on!
Impressive, right? I impressed myself!
- Okay, okay...
- Very clever.
It's not cool to sneak up like that.
No, you're the sneaky one.
I'm sorry but
don't try anything funny.
Just play this right because
Of course, just a sec...
You know it?
The GPS. My team will come find me.
Give it here.
How can I when I'm tied up?
You piece of...
Who has insurance now?
I'll cut you open!
That hurts!
Look!
Out front!
Stop!
Stop!
- The brakes don't work!
- Stop the car!
Where do you think you're going?
My arm, my arm!
"Evacuation meeting point"
"16 hours to final eruption”
- You're going to Incheon Port, right?
- What's going on?
That's right.
You must be Ji-young, Captain Cho's wife.
Yes...
Find yourself a seat.
Here.
Thank you.
You're Korean?
So... you are Korean.
Mr. Robert,
when we get to the port,
will the ship leave right away?
I'm supposed to meet my husband.
He won't be late this time.
Do you know when the ship leaves?
Oh, here. Thank you.
Can I help you?
No, you can't. Look, look...
You speak very good English.
Cutie cute...
Does it hurt?
Hurts me too, dumb-ass.
You've totally lost it.
I was scheduled to be discharged
today! I should be a civilian!
But I was dragged here to steal
a nuke and get shot at by Americans!
Along with the rest of my team!
Lieutenant Min... Tae-sik!
In fucking North Korea!
Man, please help me! I beg of you!
We have to get to Baekdu! I need your help!
This is too much! Please!
Crazy ass Southie...
What do I do?
Lift and pull. Put your back into it.
Why are we even doing this?
Look what you got us into!
This is no treasure, it's a burden.
What now?
We'll never make it on time.
We need to move faster.
The explosions are coming.
Is it your first kid?
Yeah.
When they're young is best.
Kids are beautiful then.
After that is pure hell.
Is that why you abandoned
your wife and child?
I left to save my family.
You picked a name yet?
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.
You didn't see? It's right
there in the picture.
What?
Look, look. See it?
See what? In the picture?
I can see it from here.
- The sex of the baby is...
- Yeah?
I'll tell you after you
tell me how Damo ends.
I feel sorry for a kid who
may not never see its father.
Let's go.
You're a real piece of work.
Poor kid...
You're infringing on
United States' sovereignty.
"Incheon Port"
Step away from the fence.
I repeat,
You're infringing on
United States' sovereignty.
Go on. My husband will come soon.
Your husband...
Shit.
How can there be nothing?
Hey, Ri! There's something here.
Come look.
Come on.
- What is it?
- There's something here.
Get outta the way.
There's something...
A little more.
- No, not like that.
- Will you shut up?
That's right. Just a little more.
Don't drag it.
There, there.
Yes, finally!
That feels so much better.
Oh, shit!
This tastes just like Coke.
That's because it is Coke.
Does so-Coke have a different taste?
So-Coke?
Socialist Coke!
Oh, come on. You're
supposed to be the expert.
My wife, Ji-young, loves Coke,
but she hasn't had any
since she got pregnant.
I promised I wouldn't be late this time.
What the hell am I doing here?
Some people show up so late others
don't even know who they are.
Your daughter's in Bocheon, right?
It's okay if a child forgets a face.
No, not that.
I'm worried I won't recognize her.
Hey, cutie kaka.
What does that mean?
It's a greeting
used between very close people.
Never between you and me.
Shut the hell up.
I should've gutted you when I could.
Get these cuffs off me.
- Captain!
- Lieutenant Min!
- Load it!
- Quickly!
Gimme a gun.
Crouch down.
You okay?
It's an earthquake. Hold on tight.
Step on it!
You're infringing on
United Sates' sovereignty.
Step away from the fence.
Dammitt...
We're people too.
Please save us!
You okay? We need to go.
I have to meet my husband.
He's not coming!
He's in North Korea.
What? Where?
Min, stop!
No!
- Stop!
- Stop right now!
Lift! Come on!
Tae-sik, you okay, man?
- Come over here, Min!
- Yes, sir.
Ri Jun-pyong, lower your weapon.
Get it out before I cut you open!
Hello?
Ma'am, it's me, Kang Bong-rae.
I'm with Captain Cho's wife.
- We didn't evacuate.
- What?
Listen to me carefully.
The rise in temperature fits
my estimations exactly.
If there's still time, I
want to give it another go,
but we have to give new
location coordinates to Cho.
Our comms are blocked.
If we have no other choice, we can steal.
We need the password
for comms channel access.
The security system is CCMP.
At 126 bits... how do I explain this?
Yes, Classified documents.
This is nothing. I can do this.
First, put the USB in.
We'll escort you from here.
That is all I can do for you.
And this cannot be the
government's official position.
"Letter of Resignation”
I guess that's why you
gave your resignation.
Yes, Mr. President.
I hope the decision you
made was the right one.
Thank you, sir.
I'll have the resignation processed.
"3 hours 12 mins to final explosion”
To take care of records,
manage schedules and requests,
and handle projects conducted
via surplus budgets...
there's no better server
than a university's.
Hey...
Yeah?
How did you know my
husband's in North Korea?
Well, that's...
I know because...
You ain't gonna shoot me
because of my insurance.
You're right, but what about you?
Why haven't you shot me?
You know I'm the only way
you can save your daughter.
Even if you find her, you'll
never cross the border.
Baekdu will erupt first.
I have one question.
Why are you so hung up on Baekdu?
You really think your
stupid plan's gonna work?
"Yongsuri / Bocheon"
No,
I don't.
To be honest... I don't
know anything anymore.
I don't know if we can set the thing off
or stop the volcano.
Go.
Take it with you.
Ji-young will be on board by now.
That's the only reason
I'm here. My job is done.
Saving the day and being a hero?
I'm lucky I made it this far.
So take the damn thing.
I'm tired.
Yeah...
How much time we got?
I'll bet my Sun-ok's life on you.
I hope we're not too late.
Wait, Ri!
You gotta give it back.
The map!
You're such a pain in my ass.
Where'd he... Professor?
How did it go?
Pretty nerve-racking, thanks to you.
Hello?
In-chang?
Ji-young?
Where are you?
What... You're not on the boat?
Where the hell are you?
How could you go there?
I'm almost done.
I'm coming. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you're doing this to me.
Again!
Captain Cho, I'm the Senior
Secretary to the President.
Do you have the detonator?
Wait. What's Ji-young doing with you?
Captain Cho, my name is Robert.
Who?
Rob... Kang Bong-rae.
I came up with the Baekdu plan.
Captain, can you confirm
you're headed to Yongsuri?
Put my wife on the phone.
Ji-young?
I thought you were discharged
today. What're you doing there?
Please, miss, you need to calm down...
How can I be calm?
Well, I...
Why didn't you get on the boat?
Captain Cho, Captain Cho...
You said you wouldn't be late!
You should've gotten on the boat.
Why didn't you listen to me?
Mr. Cho, I mean, Captain...
- Hey, excuse me!
- Can you hear me, Captain?
Put the person in charge on the phone.
Connect me to General Choi.
It's not General Choi.
It's me. I'm in charge.
I'm the reason you're in North Korea.
So listen to me.
You sent my husband to North Korea?
Not directly but... yes...
I'm sorry, but give me a chance.
Calm down and listen to me.
There are new developments.
Your final destination has changed.
You need to go to mine 7, not 9.
What?
Section LA-24 of mine 7 is our best shot.
Do you understand?
Section LA-24!
It won't be easy, but you
need to go all the way down.
Something's not right.
If we're going to Yongsuri
with the detonator,
why is the US military going to Bocheon?
Let me see that. Captain,
you still have the map?
Hye-sim!
Mom?
Are you Sun-ok?
You are...
what are you doing here?
It's okay. Come here.
It's okay.
Have some.
This is...
Sour and sweet.
Here.
How come you're so thin?
Are your clothes too big?
The pant legs are short.
Say something. Why are you so quiet?
She can't talk.
After what happened, it
would be strange if she could.
Half this village is like that.
You're late.
Where's the package?
There's been a change.
I don't have it with me.
Is that your daughter?
Let her cross the border, and
I'll tell you everything I know.
Please.
The air is shit here.
I confirmed the package,
but you don't have it?
Do you know how many times
you've screwed me over?
You want me to kill you?
I'll tell you everything
once we get out of here.
Baekdu's gonna erupt again.
You gotta believe me.
Believe what I'm saying!
What's the matter? You're
not acting like yourself.
Get out of the way!
Come here.
Run!
What the hell?
Did you bring them here?
What are you, some rogue spy conning me?
Stop!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Everybody! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
What's going on?
I have the detonator.
Translate that I have the detonator.
What are you doing?
The location's changed.
Dammit, why'd you swallow the map?
Who the fuck is he?
You speak Korean?
Good! I'm the crazy asshole
with the detonator.
And you want it, don't you?
Come on. Take it.
Don't shoot.
Here.
What's this?
Stop the timer!
Now!
Do it!
Stop it!
No stop. There's no stop
button. Do you understand?
You sure you wanna be here?
This will go off soon.
If you want to leave, go.
Bring me the phone!
We have the package, but there's a problem.
What a shitshow.
Wait! Stop!
No!
There's no stop button! No stop!
Wait! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
The timer is set to the
estimated explosion of Baekdu.
Whether it blows up here
or the mountain erupts,
just leave it to me and get the hell out.
All of you, go. Get out of here!
Crazy dumb-ass...
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're getting out of here.
Get in the car!
Min, get Tae-sik. We're getting out.
Yes, sir.
Transfer him to a
hospital and report to base.
What? No, I'm staying with you.
Who will drive? Take Ri and the kid and go.
Make sure the 4 of you return
safely. That's an order.
4 of us?
I started the timer, I'll see it through.
Tell me the new route and get out of here.
You hit the timer because of me.
If this fails, my daughter won't be safe.
I know the way. You can't do this alone.
We really don't have time for this.
You know what you're doing?
Of course, I do.
I'm happy I got to see you.
That's enough for me.
Let's go!
Ji-young, it's Captain Cho.
Hey, cutie cute. This is
taking longer than planned,
but I'm almost done. I'm
going home right after.
In-chang...
Are you okay?
Our little baby's doing good?
You're taking your vitamins?
I know what you're doing.
Sweetie, really...
Don't be late.
Don't be late so you can
meet our baby in person, okay?
I'm sorry, Ji-young.
Go home. I'll make sure everything's okay.
/I make sure.
In-chang...
- I promise.
- In-chang!
Wait!
You okay?
I think we have a problem.
I'm going into labor.
What?
You sure we can do this?
Shit!
Hey!
This way.
Is this it? Is this right?
Go straight.
To the right.
The right!
Excuse me.
Help us!
Inside please.
Okay. Hurry.
Hang in there.
We have a patient here.
What's happening?
She's having a baby. She's
been in labor for 20 minutes.
This way.
She's before her due date.
- Outside!
- Okay, outside.
Hurry!
Careful.
Careful!
Go on.
Go outside.
Go outside.
Now!
I think it's just after this.
The generator is out. We're screwed.
Oh, shit!
What do we do now?
Wait...
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
If we cut the cable, we can still go down.
Are you mad?
Do you know how deep these shafts go?
Got any other ideas?
I guess we die either way.
Hold on.
They all die.
What?
In the TV show Damo, they all die.
Min told me.
So that's how it ends?
I feel so sorry for Chae-ok.
Get another rope.
Okay.
Now that I know the ending,
I got something to tell you.
Wait...
What are you doing?
Actually, I don't know if
you're having a boy or a girl,
so go see for yourself.
Quit fucking around and open this.
I'll take it from here.
I got nowhere to go anyway.
You go keep your promise.
Goddammitt!
Open this! Come on!
Get out of there!
Can you promise me something?
Sun-ok
She doesn't have anyone,
and you're the only person I trust now.
Will you...
take care of her?
Please don't do this.
I've never...
Been a father
So you go
and be one.
No, don't you...
No!
Don't do it.
Don't do this. Come on.
Get out of there.
Get out of there now.
Dammitt!
Please!
Hey, cutie kaka...
You know why you ain't got eyes
in the back of your head?
So you don't look back.
Dammit!
You need to push, okay?
You're doing great! One more time!
Do we have a doctor here?
"LA-24"
It's sweet...
"Pyongyang"
"Seoul”
"1 Year Later"
The ceremony celebrating the reconstruction
of Korea is attended by leaders of parties,
guests from abroad, and thousands of
citizens filling Gwanghwamun Square.
There are 3 things to note
in the president's speech.
One, the reconstruction committee will
consist of both South and North Korea.
Shouldn't you be there?
When did you come out?
Just now. What's that?
“Welcome Robert"”
It's a welcome for you.
Couldn't you at least
write Robert in English?
How long are you staying this time?
I was asked to take
part in the reconstruction.
I'm researching regenerative
energy using volcanic heat.
That's just an excuse...
I decided to settle here.
I've grown attached to this country.
Welcome back, Rob...
Mr. Kang Bong-rae.
Seoul metro reconstruction
has reached 74 %.
Water and electricity are 100% restored,
Daddy made yummy food?
He did. Let's eat.
Okay, let's eat.
Dinner time.
Dinner time.
Let's have dinner, Sun-ok.
Wait.
Did you hear that?
You heard it, Sun-ok?
He just called me dad.
He did. I swear.
He said ma.
No, he said da, and he was looking at me.
Pretty sure it was ma.
See?
No, Sun-ok. Think again. He said da.
Ma.
My daughter is so smart!
No one is on my side in this family.
But he clearly said da.
Ma.
Let's agree to disagree.
Da.
Come here, you.
