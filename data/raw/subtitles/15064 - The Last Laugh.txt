THE LAST MAN
TO THE PARTY GUESTS
Given your many years of service
we have freed for you another post
By sending the oldest employee of our
company
in a retirement home...
THE REASONS FOR THIS MEASURE
ARE
THE FAILINGS DUE TO YOUR AGE
The film could have finish thus
In the real life,
the poor old man
would not have had much to wait 
for but death.
But the screenwriter took him into pity,
and imagined an almost
incredible follow-up
The biblical quote
"The last will be the first"
happened on this earth
The blessed is...
AN EXTRAODINARY HERITAGE !
A short while ago, in the restrooms
of the Atlantic-Hotel died
the famous billionaire , Mr. Money,
while whashing his hands.
Among the papers of this
excentric has been found
an extraodinary will
making the sole heir of his
huge fortune
the person in whose arms
he would die.
