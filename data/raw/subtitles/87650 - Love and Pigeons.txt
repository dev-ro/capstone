Good, good, you've come back, 
good job.
And you're jealous, jealous, yeah.
Lyudka, 
aye, Lyudka!
Lyudka, 
aye, Lyudka!
Did you take money?
Oh, Nadya has noticed! Too late, 
the bogeyman took the money!
Get out of here, 
get out!
Dad, did you take the money from the
wardrobe?
Mum will teach you a lesson, 
you can't even imagine
how angry she is!
Vasiliy, hey, Vasiliy, my dear!
Answer me!
I know you're there.
What do you want, Nadya?
What?
- Go and get me some water.
- There is a whole tub in the bathhouse.
- Really? Where? - Me and Lyonka 
brought some water yesterday.
- Well, I wanted to wash clothes.
- So why not use that water? 
I will use you instead. Oh how will 
I make use of you, you sponger!
Where did those 30 roubles go?!
Why are you such a crook?!
If you buy more pigeons, I'll drown 
you together with them, you sponger!
- You'll break the ladder.
- I'll break your ribs!
Stupid pigeon-keeper,
he is worried about the ladder! Oh you!
Well, I'll be the one 
to repair this ladder, Nadya.
Beware, 'cause you'll have 
to repair yourself!
Get out, I tell you!
Did you buy them or not?
Oh, sponger!
Olya, tell your mother the truth!
Did your old man buy any pigeons?
- Hey, do you hear? I am talking to you!
- Yes.
So that's it, that is where your 
dresses and ice-cream go,
and your boots and lipstick,
Lyudka.
We'll be starving now.
Hey, isn't this too much for
25 roubles, Nadya?
Yeah, go and kiss you pigeons
and continue to fleece us!
They are beautiful, the pigeons.
So you knew and you haven't even 
uttered a word to your Mum!
- Nadya, these ones are tafty.
- Oh!
- What do you mean? - They have 
these plums on the back of their heads.
- Wanna see? - You'll see 
when  you get out from there!
- Lyudka! – Huh?
- Duh! What are we going to do?
- We don't have any more cash.
- We still have money in the account.
Oh, just you wait till I find something 
to chuck at you!
- Have you deposited much to withdraw 
now? - Well, but you did!
Oh, I feel like killing you with 
something, you sponger!
Well, Lyudka, go and fetch the bankbook.
- Where?
- There!
- Ah...
- Yeah!
Hey, go and fix the oven.
I am tired of using the stove 
every time I need to cook.
Do you hear me, 
when I do the talking?
Yeah, Nadya, I'll go fix it in a minute.
Mum, he has waited for these pigeons
the whole month!
Well, do you think that 
earning money is easy?
That'd be fine if he used it for
something real, but pigeons...
Well, at least he isn't drinking.
Yeah, that's true. He isn't drinking.
Ok, I'll go to the store now.
Hey, what's that, standing here with the
peeling eyes, miss Dad's protectress?
Lyudka, when Lyonya comes home
from vocational school feed the lad.
He can fix a meal himself, can’t he?
If you talked like this to your
husband, he'd run away from you! 
But Dad hasn't run away from you.
Do not compare yourself with me, I 
forgive and forget quickly.
- Hey, you have to eat too.
- I don't want to.
- Where is the fuel can?
- In the shed. Where are you going?
We'll swim to the neighbouring village 
with Uncle Sasha. 
They have gunpowder 
in the store there. 
- Buy my share too.
- Sure!
- I wish you wealth and health!
- Hi Uncle Mitya! Bye Uncle Mitya!
- Vasiliy, Lyudka, hullo! - Sit down 
and have lunch with us, Uncle Mitya!
- Yeah, sure.
- Hi Aunt Sasha, bye, Aunt Sasha!
Uncle Mitya, hide it!
There, yes.
She won't find it there.
Hey, Lyudka, came for a vacation?
Why on your own?
- Where is your young...
- Uncle Mitya, don't
Well, she has some troubles with 
her young man.
- What's happened?
- We don't ask.
Yeah, good of you to come.
Oh, look at them!
They're already chasing 
a drink! That was to be expected!
Chasing a drink, are you?
Oh, my dear Sasha is here!
Yeah, your dear Sasha is here!
I saw you by the store, so I called: 
Mitya, Mitya! No reaction!
Just zips along!
Ha? What d'you say? Oh, my hearing 
is so bad nowadays... Say something.
What should I say?
- Hullo, Uncle Mitya.
- I can't hear you.
I'll have to go the ear doctor and 
get some thingy for my ear. 
I didn't drink, I didn't! Though 
there is a good reason for drinking.
Or we’ll waste Bastille Day...
80 years since the birth of...
Wow! Can't be that she's
80 already!
Sit down, Aunty, eat with us.
Has today’s mail come?
Katya is on her way, 
I've just seen her.
- Aunty, please, help yourself, 
all right? - Yeah, you go!
Vasiliy, what is that you are 
washing your hands with?
You sponger!
Well, Sasha, I will 
never forgive you...
Why are you laughing? Our proud
batleship never surrenders to the foe!
[singing] When lassies go to
bathhouse
[singing] I climb
on its roof
[singing] and I stomp my feet.
- Got a day off?
- Yep.
So why are you drinking?
Did you squabble with Nadya?
- Aha. God knows what...
Yeah, I'm at odds with mine too.
She's there now, and I'm here.
She'll come here and I'll
go there!
I let her do the marathon!
- Drinking, eh? 
- Drinking! Hello, Sasha!
- Have a sip.
- Nah, I don't like this.
- Is everything ok?
- Yeah.
- Cheers!
- Take the buckets.
Well, better send him to the Navy
than to the Forestry.
- He decided on his own! - Ah, he knows 
nothing about the beauty of sea life!
- Lyonya, don't tell your mother!
- Yeah, ok.
I couldn't for the life of me 
understand you
I fight with my bogeywoman,
while you always accept the blame.
- What does she want anyway, why
the fuss? - It's because of the pigeons.
But she's not angry anymore.
Well, you just strap her once and
she'll become as good as gold! 
That's what they are like –
they’ve gotten pretty brazen!
Pour some more!
Take highlanders for instance, 
how do they deal with this issue:
When they talk,
she won't enter a room.
That's because they're mountaineers.
Oh. I mean, people from the mountains!
Have you seen mine?
Sure! Where else can he be
if not here! 
It's only a couple of mugs,
not to forget the taste!
- Give me your bag, I'll help.
It's probbaly heavy.
Oh, what a helper, look
at him! Had some pity!
- Have you seen Filippov?
- No. What's up?
Well of course! If you ever are at home!
He's looking for you. - Why?
See, his crank broke down, he
asks for some help. Run to him. 
- Bah! Son of a biscuit! So I 
better run. - Yeah, go.
- Vasiliy! Has my beau swam nearby?
- No, I haven't seen him. 
Oh those spongers!
Yeah, spongers.
Well, that's a good one! In your age,
why can't you stop fighting?
Oh, I laugh too much. It's
not a good sign.
I have to help harvest potatoes tomorrow
in the morning, Filippov asked.
- I won't be able to go now! - Gee, 
he'll be back, he's nowhere else to go!
Oh, Nadya, could you please give me 
your spade. Ours is so blunt. -Yeah.
Mitya would've sharpened it, but he's 
nowhere to be found, 
just watch his smoke. 
Lyudka, aye, Lyudka!
Take the bags. Here you go!
- Here you go!
- Hello, dear Lyuda!
Hello, Aunty Sasha!
Oh, I can't take my eyes from you!
Hey, Nadya, do you hear what I'm saying?
I can't take my eyes of Lyudka!
You turned into such a beaty!
A real beauty, that's what you are! 
Why don't you visit us? Hey, drop in 
sometime for a cup of tea with jams!
I have such a yummy lingberry jam 
this year!
- Here you go, Aunty Sasha!
- Nadya!
- Wha?
Where were you, you old loon?
I have brought terrible news to your 
house, Mrs Nadya, 
call all of your children. 
What has happened?
Vasiliy went to repair that crank and
I went with him. 
He wanted to have a smoke.
So he came, and as he
lit his cigaret...
And me, I sat near him
Hey, you old fool, out with it! You 
drive people into a frenzy with this.
I don't understand bogeywomen.
Nadya, take her away.
She's right! Don't drag your feet! 
Spit it out!
He was standing near the 
railway car... 
Who was standing? Who was standing
there? Vasiliy?
The log slipped from the car
and – smash – it rolled to the ground!
And its end banged Vasiliy’s head.
Smashed your Father, 
Lyudka. That's it.
Vasiliy!
Damn it... That condition will 
remain forever now.
- What will remain forever?
- A squint.
So he's alive?
Don't you croak, you silly goose!
'course he's alive,
but his left eye now looks this way 
and the other one looks that way.
And what did you think?
I will show you what
we thought, oh you old fool!
Oh you! 
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
- Not bad. Not bad indeed.
- And now you.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- Well, announce the next figure!
- Me? Announce?
Yes, the second figure.
Go and announce it.
Figure number two – 
the sad one!
Hey, why are you here, you old geezer?
And that you dare!
Just wait until I get the broom, 
you'll learn your lesson.
- Please, don't.
- “Please, don't”!
- Forgive me, Nadya.
- No way. I almost died of fear.
I'll tell Vasiliy about it
when he returns from the hospital.
That'll teach you!
- Nadya, do you have some brew?
- Sure we do, but not for you!
- Nadya, I feel sick. - Poor thing! Look
at him! Didn't have enough to drink?
I'll go and tell your wife how you
latch onto your neighbours for a drink
Oh, but she's not with us anymore, my 
dear Sasha, she's not!
That's it! She's not here...
Hm, I wonder, where has she 
gone then?
I told her, let me call them, 
But she went, 'No, it'll pass'.
And then I saw she started to 
blot.
So I decided to disobey her and ran.
- Where to? What are you talking about?
I ran to fetch an ambulance. 
And we went to the hospital on it.
And then the doctor
came out and said
'Dear Grandpa, 
your Grandma has died'
Uncle Mitya, what is it all about? 
How could this happen? 
He told me that she had died.
I can't.
How could this be? I saw 
her 2 days ago.
And yesterday she wanted to go 
harvest potatoes 
and tellingly, with Filippov's family.
Then she's gone all bad. She went, 
'I can't bend over, my heart aches'.
She told us, go on your own and 
dig out those potatoes.
Why didn't you run to us straight away?
Oh, it's only now that 
I started to feel better.
I couldn't bring myself 
to an upright position.
I was trying to walk – but my 
legs wouldn't hold me,
as if they were made of cotton wool.
My hands are still shaking.
Have a drink, Uncle Mitya, 
have a drink.
No, don't bother!
- Please, drink.
- Oh, my dear Sasha disapproved of this.
Under these circumstances 
you are allowed, poor thing.
What was wrong with her. 
did the doctors tell you?
Miocardinal infection.
The scar was this big. The guy
showed me during the autopsy.
- Eat something. 
- No, thanks. 
They'll bring her tomorrow.
In general, they are kept for 3 days
in morgue,
but there ain't no spaces. 
- Can I expect some neighbourly help 
from you? - Sure, we'll help you.
- Lyudka, Aunty Sasha has died. 
- It can't be.
Uncle Mitya took her yesterday to the 
hospital, she died there. Heart failure.
Miocardinal infection, Lyudka.
- She wasn't that old.
- How old was she?
How old am I? Do the math,
she was 3 years younger.
So how old was she, Lyudka?
Lyonya! Grandma Sasha has died.
- Right.
- Yesterday.
And tellingly, 
we loved each other.
Do you know, how she used to call me?
Noone knows.
I'd call her Saniushka and she'd
call me Mitiuniushka.
I go: Saniushka, and she goes:
Mitiuniushka!
And such a voice, right, Nadya!
Oh, how she used to sing!
All those loud 'Oh's' and 
'Ey's in the beginning...
The moment of happiness 
And moment of parting...
I am ready to share with you 
All the time.
Let's shake 
each other's hands 
And let's start this long journey
For many, many years!
Have you dug your potatoes yet?
And you? What are you doing?
I'm telling them about my dream.
Those dreams can be pretty nasty.
Nadya, why have you given him a drink?
Why do you pour him this thing?
What's that? What all of you are up to?
I've only just left the yard and here 
he goes at once, gets himself plastered!
Run, Uncle Mitya!
- Aunty Sasha, he has 
buried you. - What?
He goes, and tomorrow they'll bring her
from the morgue! 
Ugly scab!
Got you!
Our proud battleship 
never surrenders to the foe!
Figure number three...
A parting one.
I am leaving for a resort. And there 
I'll go to a bar and will try a cocktail
The new ones will have little ones soon,
take care so that cat doesn't get them.
Buy them some wheat.
I know. Dad, show me your trick.
- What trick? 
– Give a pigeon water to drink.
Oh, this isn't any trick, this is
training. Ok, bring me a mug.
Wow! It drinks! It isn't afraid!
There was once this Volodya, 
a local fool.
He could make 5 of them 
drink at once. 
- A fool?
- Aha.
We loved him a lot, 
all the villagers loved him.
Anyone could ask him 
for help. 
He'd come at once 
and would work the most.
God didn't give him brains, but he had 
a big soul and a lot of strength.
- He was murdered, poor thing.
- Who did that?
Some labourers. They were driven out of 
the city and settled in our village. 
In the early days they weren't settled
here, but then suddenly they were.
They didn't think twice, 
started to drink and fight.
He happened to see one of the fights.
And as little kids do, he
started to wave a finger at them:
'This isn't a good thing to do, you
mischieves, why are you fighting?'
And those, as if they would think twice,
just took a knife and stabbed him.
There was an abandoned church 
and pigeons used to live in it. 
Volodya started to feed them. 
He used to go there 
and crumb a loaf of bread for them.
They would fly around him, touch his 
face and cheeks with their wings
and he would trill with laughter.
It was amusing.
They were not afraid of him, he didn't
startle them at all, unlike all others.
I remember that he had a red shirt,  
all covered with little holes 
from their small claws.
He was burried in that shirt.
While he was earthed, they were 
flying around his little grave.
And later, when everyone was gone, 
they circled around it for a bit 
and flew away. 
We haven't seen them since.
They are darn smart, they are. 
- Where is the health resort voucher?
- Jeeez, I put it in the suitcase.
Now, a razor. 
Oh, hullo, Uncle Mitya. Come in.
- Ah, don't worry. I'll stand here.
- Come in, come in.
Vasiliy, listen! Hide money here, in 
this pocket, I've sewn it there.
What are you staring at? 
Go away from here!
I am sorry, I didn't want to stand in
your way while you were hiding money. 
Yeah, sure! Go and tell everyone 
in the village about it, 
you windbag!
So you understood, you'll put them
here and then secure it with a pin.
And if it comes undone?
Oh... It'll jab you.
- So what should I do? Sew it in in  
this hurry? - I'll put it in my pocket.
Your pocket? Are you out of you mind? 
They'll pick it out.
Don't you know those ruffians?
You wouldn't even notice!
Just wear it, no further ado!
I'll do it myself!
What's happened?
- What have you done?
- I've ironed it.
Who'll tie it now?
Well, I guess that's it.
No resort for me now.
Maybe Nikolai Trofimovich will help?
He is not wearing ties!
Vasiliy, do not get upset just yet.
I'll find someone in a sec!
- I have a right to say goodbye to 
a friend. - Have you brought it?
Customs service.
Well, Vasiliy, have an easy flight.
- Are you flying? – I am. I'll see what 
pigeons see, when they're up above. 
- What is that place? - The resort 
for locomotive organs, fiddle sticks!
- No, the smell, 
Uncle Mitya. 
Don't you worry, 
I have bay leaves, we'll chew on them.
Are you some kind of agent provocateur
or what, Uncle Mitya? 
Dad! Hello, Uncle Mitya! I got bread 
and some tinned food.
Ok, put them there
Hey, why are you so at ease?
The bus is coming!
- Let's have some tea before we go.
- Yeah, I know this 'tea' of yours!
Lyudka, don't tell your Mum.
Vasiliy, jiggers!
Jiggers!
Ha, and my handsome widower 
is here, of course!
- So what's with that? - Nothing.
I went everywhere, noone knows.
I've had it! Unpack 
my suitcase!
That's it!
Vasiliy, what's came over you? 
Why the hell would you need it?
You'll just unbutton your shirt 
like this...
Unbutton! It's South there!
There's a culture there! On the box 
they say it's a cultural stronghold.
Give it to me.
Oh, Lyudka, oh, you beauty!
I tie it differently.
Kids, say goodbye 
to your Dad.
Regards and see you later.
Well, Daughter... This is nothing
I'll be back soon.
- Write us something.
- I'll write you something.
- Shall we kiss?
- Kiss? Those ideas of yours.
Now watch out there, 
at those resorts...
- Write to me, don't forget.
- Bring me some shells
 and a palm.
- Oh, Daughter, a palm? How should 
I carry it? - Just a branch!
Ah, a branch!
Good bye and good luck!
Take care, comrade! You've splashed 
water all over me! 
I am all wet now, from top to toe! 
I'm sorry!
- Oh, hello.
- What is the matter?
You work in our personnel department,
in administration.
- Comrade Kuz'kin?
- Yep, Kuziakin.
- Vladimir Valentinovich?
- Yep, Vasiliy Iegorovich.
I have a professional memory. So you're 
the one who got the 2nd resort voucher?
The world is so small!
No, no, get out first.
Aha, on your orders.
Who could have thought! To be thousands
kilometers from home
and to meet a colleague 
in the sea.
Excuse me, have you come here after 
sustaining an injury as well?
God no! I was advised about the 
benefits of this climate 
by my mentalist.
- Menta who?
- List. She foretells future!
Haven't you heard about it?
I'm busy all the time, 
you know, household.
Strange... All the papers 
write about it all the time now.
- What's that? That's her job?
- No, she works in a different field.
- By the way, speaking of work. 
How's your plan?
Our plan? It's all right. 
We're fulfiling the plan. 
Your Forestry is in our good books.
We're very satisfied with your work. 
Thank you very much.
Just one second, please!
I'll read the front page.
[song] And the heart is breaking...
[song] into small parts when I
recall my home
- Hullo, Ms Raisa! - Hello! So we're 
neigbours on the top of everything.
Excuse me!
She took a shoe, 
a regular shoe,
lifted it by the laces
and let it go.
The shoe remained hanging 
in the air. 
Ms Raisa, how's it possible?
Telekinesis. The movement of the things 
with only the help of the gaze.
Presently this phenomenon is studied 
by many mentalists and laboratories.
Well, not officially yet. But genetics 
wasn't recognized as well, you remember?
But the progress is inexorable.
Do you agree with me?
Precisely.
You see the dwarf Japanese mandarine
trees 
- I will acquaint you with her, but 
please, be discrete! – Like a grave! 
Because as soon as they discover
mentalists, they register them.
They work on the state scale,
foresee what happens abroad.
If anything happens – the Government
turns to the mentalist immediately. 
Then mentalist sends an inquiry into
space: if this and that, then what?
And the answer 
is transmitted via the astral bodies. 
- And only after this the Government 
makes a decision. – Really?
But this is veryruinous for mentalists, 
their nervous system can become a wreck.
Well, no wonder! To think
for the Government every day!
On the site of the crash 16 humanoids
were found.
They were short, 1 m 20 cm
on average,
green and sexless. 
You know, their eyes were
really wise and sad. 
Oh, and you, have you seen 
them, Ms Raisa?
Have I seen them?  
No one saw them.
After a minute in the sun 
they melted. 
- Really? - Really! They turned 
into these 16 spots. 
Don't let it pass your lips, 
it's classified!
- I got it! I'll be silent as a grave!
- We and the Americans conceal it, 
but we've both been communicating 
with them for a long time. 
- With whom? - With the mentalists, 
with the humanoids. 
It is a proven fact that people
descend from them. 
They have just agreed to write in the
textbooks that we decsended from
monkeys! What an oaf!
Silence, remedial sleep!
I brought her a picture
of another person.
He has disappeared, 
all of a sudden, somehow.
She glanced, 
went to the map...
And what happened, Ms Raisa?
What happened next, she went 
to the map, and? 
She pointed her finger and said: this
is a hot spot,
he's there now. 
Exuse me, Ms Raisa. 
Did they find him?
- Did they find that chap?
- Who?
I asked did they find that chap
This electrosleep, I must tell you, is 
as if we were in the Stone age! 
Not to compare with the Eastern medicine
But do you know how they do it there? 
Ping with the needle, squirt, and 
that's it. I do not react to that.
Yep, true, for me, my head cracks
and that's it. Nothing more. 
Excuse me please...
Aha...
This is some strange kind of apples.
How much are these?
Lyonya asked to get him 
batteries for the radio, 
And I need to get a present for Olya.
Oh, I love you, I love you, Olya...
Is that your wife, Olya? 
No, Olya is my younger Daughter,
and Nadya is my wifey.
Nadya... That's a beautiful name. 
My wifey, my compass in life... 
Excuse me, and what is 
your husband's name?
Whose? 
Oh, no! I value my freedom so
that you know!
Marriage is voluntary slavery. 
Really?
And who bought you this tie?
Oh, that one, my wifey bought it.
I recommend you to buy this one, It goes
well with your suit and with you eyes. 
[song] After patting little children's
heads
[song]  I will say 
in tears...
He asks, so you can't stand
it anymore?
- She says, I can't. 
- These were her exact words?
I'll try to help you.
He took her to his office,
took off her clothes,
layed her down on his table
And then, with his bare hands, no
sharp instruments, 
opened her body. They have their 
secrets, the skin has parted on its own
''Does it hurt?'', he asked.
''No, I feel good''. 
He took her 
intestines  
and put them in a bowl.
He washed them there really well, almost
scrubbed, and then rinsed. 
– Son of a biscuit!
Bang! - and threw everything that 
was aching to the bin! 
So what, our doctors 
can't do that?
Well, this is a specific
Philipino medical practice. 
Ms Raisa, and that hussy, 
is she alive?
But of course! 
And feels very well.
But she doesn't recognize people. 
She lost her memory for some reason. 
But the important thing is not the
result, but the process.  
– Yeah, I understand you.
- Did I tire you?
- Oh no, not at all! I learnt so much!
I wouldn't be able to learn about all 
of this in my entire life otherwise. 
- Do you know what question bothers me?
- What is it, Ms Raisa?
How did it happen that you and me, we 
both happened to be here together,
under this charming Southern sky?
How did it happen, Vasiliy?
Well, it's because of the health resort 
vouchers, we work for the same company.
Oh, you are not a romantic, Vasiliy 
Iegorovich, you are not.
[song] Remember those mountains,
Remember those palm trees
[song] But you should forget my address
once and for all
[song] But the eternity comes to an end
[song] And the parting comes
[song] And the time for 
farewell
[song] Is coming nearer 
and nearer
[song] Let's look
[song] Into each other's eyes
[song] Let's dance
[song] Let's dance
[song] For the last time
Swimming! Let's go swimming, 
Vasiliy!
- Oh, you have dropped something!
- Let's take the clothes off!
Oh, these stars in the world of ours!
[inscription] Vasiliy, be careful!
- They're shining!
And the moon is swinging...
Yeah, swaying a lot.
- Tell, me, Vasiliy, am I drunk? 
- You're fine, we just had a tiny drop. 
Thank you a lot. You are 
a very kind person.
And your family, your kids, 
is everything all right? 
You live in harmony, don't you?
- Well, different things happen.
- You don't look like a troublemaker.
- Well, I am not.
- Your wife? - Yep.
- Wifey... - It's all because of the 
pigeons, because of the trifles. 
It is sad, very sad.
- Do you breed pigeons?
- Yup.
How cute! 
Pigeons!
Ms Raisa! Ms Raisa!
What's wrong?
Why is that? I do not do this for sale,
I do it for soul. Did I offend you?
You know, as a kid I was a crazy
mischief! A real tomboy.
My Dad wanted to have a son, but 
a girl was born.
- And what was her name?
- Whose? - Well, that girl's?
- Ms Raisa.
- Oh, I don't get this...
My Dad wanted a boy, but a girl 
was born, I was born!
Yes, I understood.
My Dad... My Dad...
- Do you know who was my Dad?
- No.
- He was in the cavalry, an officer!
- Oh, yeah... Got it.
We also used to chase pigeons.
And I used to...
I never knew how to whistle.
And you know how to do it. But
I am surprised at a different thing:
how tender these stupid birdies 
can be!
Why human beings are so different?
Why, Vasiliy?
Exactly! 
- And she says to me: where is 
the money? - And where was the money?
Oh, I've bought 
a couple of pigeons.
Oh, they're smart, 
the feathered tribe!
You take a pigeon and let him go up, 
towards the clouds, to the flock, 
and it becomes so tiny, not bigger than 
a match head,
but you keep a dove. And then you 
just raise your hand and wave,
and he throws himslef at her like 
a stone and starts cooing at her.
- How can you explain it? - Well, a 
procreation instinct most likely.
Well, love. 
Most probably...
- Oh, love, dear Vasiliy Grigorievich...
- Raisa Zakharovna...
[inscription] Oh, Vasiliy, how
could you...
I think I'm well, but
I'm not sure yet.
I've gathered a lot of shells for Olya, 
they have taken up the whole nightstand.
I'll cut the palm branch before 
leaving, otherwise it may whither.
I've bought a lot of batteries for
Lyonya's radio.
- Right!
All in all, the things you've asked 
for - I've got them all!
Dear Nadya! 
Please exscuse me that...
What's that, Lyudka? It looks 
like this is someone else's hand.
Dear Nadya! Please excuse me that
I interfere,
but Vasiliy is a very timid
and delicate person.
That's why it is difficult for 
him to make a decision. 
On the shores of this wonderful sea
me and Vasiliy have found each other.
- What's that?
They and Vasiliy have found each other.
It has happened unexpectedly, 
as if by obsession.
We are still a little bit at a loss.
But God's ways are past finding out
and noone knows what kind of trials 
await us. One thing is sure, we won't 
be able to live without each other.
Lyudka, I don't understand. Who is that
person writing, is it his roommate?
This ain't a roomate, 
this is a woman.
Please, don't be afraid, I'm not against
him communicating with his children.
I believe that you, being an 
intelligent person, will not condemn us 
for this little ray of happiness in the 
dark sky of life. Please forgive us. 
Sincerely yours, 
Missus Raisa.
Missis Raisa
Pee Es. Thank You 
for Vasiliy.
- What's this, Lyudka? What does this 
P S mean? - Postsscriptum.
 Afterword.
- Thank you for Vasiliy.
- Thank who? - You! For VasIliy!
Oh, wait! Here he wrote again!
Nadya, we fly back
home on the 4th.
- What day is it today?
- 11th.
Well, they must have arrived by now.
So do not write to this address. 
I wouldn't be able to tell this
to you, a letter is better.
And Ms Raisa a is a good woman. 
She even helped to chose the presents.
Good-bye, Vasiliy.
Oh, woe is me! 
Oh, what have I done to deserve this!
Lyonya, what is that?! Isn't he ashamed,
such a piglet? Son of a bitch!
Do you see what kind of 
son of a bitch your Dad is!
- Why do you cry?!
- I don't know what to do!
Oh, woe is me!
- Lyonya, have you fed the piglets?
- Yes.
I will tear away the heads of his 
pigeons! Lyudka, where is our axe?
I will definitely do it, 
you damn son of a bitch!
But what do pigeons 
have to do with this?
So it is all right to mock 
your Mum? Is it?
We brought you up! 
Do you think it was easy?
If I meet him, I'll kill him,
but pigeons have nothing to do with it.
- What do you mean, you'll kill him?
- You're a fool.
Hey, Lyonya! Are you insane?
Don't even think about it!
Grabbing him by the back of 
his neck and shaking him well will do!
- Hey, sit down! Where are you going?
- I'm going to the outhouse.
- I'll go with you!
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well, I'll just guard you.
- I am going to the outhouse!
I know this story! If you do 
what you think of
you'll end up in jail and 
your life will go askew!
My dear Lyonya, please be patient, maybe
he will come back!
Are you all out of your minds?
Hello!
Hello!
- Are you Nadya? - Yes.
- I came to talk to you.
- And where are you from?
- I am from the administration.
Good afternoon, please, come through.
Oh, samovar! How cute.
- Such a misery has befallen us! 
- Mother, cut it off!
- Excuse me!
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'll go and put a kettle
on for the tea! - Please don't bother!
- And who are you in the administartion?
- I work in the personnel department.
Why do you look after your 
personnel so badly?
They run wherever they want!
And you don't care!
Well, you know, in general we
do not have any personnel turnover.
But we do! A horrible turnover
happened to us!
You should reprimand him real good, 
ream that fool out.
But maybe you're here because of 
the different issue?
Ah no, precisely because
of this very issue.
Don't you have anything 
else to do? Go!
Excuse us.
Lyonya, hey, come back!
Where are you going?
- To feed the piglets. - Well, listen 
here, don't you even think about it!
- Oh, he says that he's gonna kill him!
- Whom? - His Father!
He's very quiet, but then he gets a
thing into his stupid head, and I worry.
Well, this is certainly not a way out. 
- How can one think this way!
- Sure!  - He's his Father!
He found some other woman, that bastard,
and that's the last we saw of him!
I was told about the things
that happen on those resorts. 
How those loose women get there?
Why do you give them resort vouchers?
Nadya, we both 
are women.
Yep.
- I want us to understand each other.
- Yes, yes.
- It is not that bad.
- How come? It is really bad.
Please, calm yourself down.
- Do you love him?
- Huh?
Do you love 
that man?
He ain't no man! If he
were a man, he wouldn't have done this!
This bitch got him around her finger,
and that fool let himslef be tricked.
Why do you think that he was tricked, 
maybe he tricked her?
Oh, don't talk nonsense! A good
woman would never do such a thing.
You'll see, she'll get her share! 
He has a lot on his mind, 
but God is not blind!
- She will repent a thousand times...
- Nadya, what's the matter?
... this viper for taking 
husbands from their families! 
Why do you put it as if she had
hundreds of them. 
Well, you ain't saying he's the 
first one for her and that she's 16?
Not 16! 
And not the 1st.
What if this is love, Nadya?
- How do you mean, love? 
- I mean, real love!
This is what you should have thought
about in the 1st place, dear Nadya!
Oh, I don't know...
We have lived so many years with 
him without fighting and all was good.
- What if it was a habit? – What do you 
mean, a habit? - Just simply a habit.
That is why I ask you:
do you love that man?
Oh, I don't know.
You say all these different words...
I have no time to think about love,
' cause I don't have enough air,
I can't breathe, 
it burns in my chest,
as if I swallowed hot coals 
from the oven.
Nadya, dear, 
do not hold anything against Vasiliy. If
you love him, you won't hurt him.
I understand that it is difficult
for the heart to accept it.
But we are people and we have 
a rea ... son. 
What's the matter?
- Why are you looking at me in this way?
- So this is you, huh?
Me, Nadya, what is your patronimic?
Oh, what's this world coming to?
Lyudka, ey,
Lyudka! 
What?
- Just look what's happening! It's her!
- How do you do, Lyuda.
Do you intend to make a scandal?
I came to you, Madame, because I 
deemed you to be an intelligent woman.
- Oh you little bleached bitch!
- What do you mean, bleached?
This is my natural colour!
As far as I understand, our meeting 
has come to an end.
Thank you for your attention.
We'll discuss this situation
with Vasiliy
and we'll inform you about the 
results in the written form.
Good-bye, Lyuda. 
good-bye, Nadya.
please, do not bother to see me off.
Live happily.
Oh you, I'll show you...
Girls, restrain your Mother, damn!
Calm down, stay calm.
Oh what a pest!
''Lyudka, aye, Lyudka!'' Pooh, 
what a boor!
What was that? What is happening? 
I tell her everything from the 
bottom of my heart... 
And she turns out to be... 
her...
If I get to know 
that any of you
see your 
Dad, 
I'll curse you.
 Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!
- Hello!.. Miss.
Hello, my friend.
Will you have some lunch... 
Ma'am?
Grated cheese, beetroot...
A little bit more. Like this.
Oh Jesus...
- I see that!
- I wanted to put a little bit of salt.
Otherwise it isn't possible
to swallow it.
By no means! Salt is 
a white poison.
- Isn't sugar a white poison?
- Sugar is a sweet poison.
- Ms Raisa, maybe some bread?
- Bread is a poison!
Oh, I wouldn't mind getting poisoned 
by a good slice of bread!
It's true. I wouldn't mind
getting stuffed real good! 
- Getting stuffed? What's wrong with 'eat'?
- Eh? - Not 'eh', but 'excuse me'!
Ms Raisa!
Don't be so tragic about it!
Raisa, really! Please, stop!
Excuse me, my dear.
I was really hurt today.
- Well... Eat, eh?
- Elegy.
Massenet?
Come here, my beloved one, sit
down and give me your hand. 
Like this... And let us be silent.
- Why are people so cruel?
- Who?
Why, oh why, 
oh why?
But people are different, Raisa.
Oh my, I haven't done 
anything bad to her!
- Raisa, please, eat.
- Honey, you're hungry?
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.
Oh, the barrier is unsurmountable.
No understanding for our love!
Moreover, I almost got killed.
Those people just stood there, watched. 
Vasiliy, those were your children!
Such aloofness!
- Raisa, you didn't go to Nadya, 
did you? - Yes I did.
I stumbled upon a wall of egotism, 
hate and lack of understanding. 
- Why did you go there at all?
- I wanted to establish contact.
You're a shy person... but you'll
have to deal with it on your own. 
Careful, honey, or you'll spoil both
the needle and Massenet.
- All right then, I'm leaving.
- No, wait, we have to decide.
No, there is nothing to decide. 
I am leaving. 
- Where to?
- Some place. I have packed already.
- You mean you are leaving altogether?
- Yep.
- What about me? 
- Why do you need me, Raisa?
I don't know how to wash 
socks and shirts. 
But you've learnt.
- I curse!
- I like it! It is risque. 
I got used to it. If you want... 
Doodle-poodle! I will start too!
No, please, don't. I can't, Ms Raisa! 
I am drawn to them.
- Drawn to whom?
- To Nadya, to the kids.
- So you're going to that Gorgon?
- Ah no, I'm going to my wife.
- What about me?
- Ms Raisa, I really can't...
I will not let you go, Vasiliy!
I will not let you go!
What is this shit, really,
Miss, what is happening?
I wanted it all to be good, 
good for people.
What's the matter?
Vasiliy, Vasiliy!
You are my happiness, my destiny,
you are my love!
If you want, I can learn how to make 
pies, I like them myself.
I will wash everything by myself, 
do you want that?
Tell me what you want me 
to become! I'll be that!
Raisa, really, you're 
like in the movies.
Dear Vasiliy, don't you believe me?
Ms Raisa, please, let me go!
Dear Vasiliy, please, do not kill me.
We are from different social strata, 
but destiny brought us together.
- Destiny? What are you talking about?
One night at the bar barred my way back!
What do you mean, at the bar?!
Oh, what a foolish woman I am!
Calm yourself down. What do you want
from me, for God's sake? 
- You've thrown yourself upon me out 
of boredom! - Me? On you?
Well, who else? Being all alone all 
the time... It aint' no fun, for sure!
- Leave us alone!
- Oh, yeah, this is the right decision!
- Get out of my house!
- Oh, this is the real thing now!
- Please leave us alone!
- I just wanted a better life!
- Get out from my house! Leave us alone!
- Sure, all right!
So what does it say?
Vasiliy will come, he will for sure!
The road is for Nadya, not for him.
Nadya will go somewhere. 
But this anger here... 
- Well, anger, sure! Is there a reason
to rejoice? - Oh, go away!
Mum, maybe you should 
get out of bed?
Yeah, Nadya, come on, 
stretch your legs.
Just do one small thing, 
then the other.
Just switch your mind to the chores! 
Oh, let me stay in bed 
for just a tiny bit more.
A tiny bit? It has been 2 days already.
Come on! Get up! You can't
go on like this, Mum!
You'll leave for the city, Lyonya will 
get conscripted ...
If I die, do not forget 
about Olya,
take her with you...
Sure thing! Hullo, what are you 
talking about?
Oh, those city dwellers... 
Sasha, don't lose touch with
reality. 
What does the city 
have to do with this?
Where did he want to go, 
remind me?
Oh Jeez, well, to the bar! Bar!
Well, where will I get this bar
in here?
Ah, after a couple of bar-crawlings 
he'll crawl back to you!
Ok, ok, get up!
- Nadya, get up, really!
- Come on!
Hey, you may get used to lying
and then die for real! 
Legs...
- All right, we're sittng.
- Don't act as a child.
So we're siting, good, 
we're sitting.
Oh, such a sponger!
See, Olya, you used to defend
your Dad! See what kind of man he is!
Don't bully the kid!
I'd murder him, 
I wish he were dead!
Nadya, you've lost your mind 
completely! What is it? Lost your mind!
Mother!
Yeah, you two always had some secrets.
Now he'll make you more 
siblings, and you'll see!
Your bad Mum is here, 
at home
and your goody Daddy 
is who knows where! 
- Got himself another Mum. 
So go to her! - Mother, dear!
Yeah, go to her, she's no doubt
all kind and nice, does not scold! 
Stop it! You're totally 
crazy and insane!!
Yeah, yell at your Mum, 
she hasn't had enough yet!
How should I not yell at you?
Stop crying!
Look what you're 
doing to yourself! 
I am doing it to myself! 
Sure, Mum is bad!
- Who told you that you're bad?
- Noone! I scold myself.
I am not blind. You all think 
that Dad... All because of me ... 
- I am not blind!
- You've gone mad!
Sure, Mum is foolish 
and nasty!
But when the trouble came to
whom did you run to, sweetie?
If I knew you'd reproach me
for that...
You ran to your Mother, 
remember?
Remember what you told me?
How you cried in my lap?
And now Mum is foolish and bad,
Vasiliy has left me.
So you too, 
just leave me!
Run wherever you want!
Nadya, enough, enough.
What are you doing? Nadya, 
what is she doing?
Let her go, 
let her jump in a lake!
Lyuda, what is this?
What's wrong with you both?
Thank you, Mum! Thank you!
I've come, I haven't worked, 
just plagued you with my presence! Who
would have liked that!
I have holidayed here long enough,
time to go.
Lyuda, Lyuda! What has come 
over you? Jesus Christ!
I held them so dear, Aunty Sasha,
I thought I had a home, my home!
I came to complain about my darn life
and it turns out that I did it 
only because of my troubles!
Well, calm down! If you're distressed
you say things you don't mean!
That's enough! I'm not made of stone!
How to go on? I know nothing.
I have ran away from my husband
and now my Dad is a runaway...
Lyuda, don't leave!
Lyudka, forgive me, I am a fool, 
please, forgive.
Oh, the flood is coming.
And you! How much of my blood
have you drunk?
I hardly ever wasn't worried about you!
Who was sneaking out trough the 
back door to go to Daria Usviatskaia?
I told you, I went to get
some cucumbers.
Sure, you had to get some cucumbers! 
Have you stomached 
those cucumbers all right?
And what about Mania Zykova? 
- Tell me that tou weren't eyeing her! 
- You were! - You're all the same!
What has gotten into you... 
All this rage...
- You're drinking too much, Uncle Mitya!
- Yes, I don't know where to hide...
What has this got to do with it?
You better be quiet, Uncle Mitya!
Oh, Daddy!
Holy Moly, Vasiliy!
So where is this handsome lad
coming from?
Have you forgotten anything? 
Have you come to tell us something? 
Oh, look at him! What's wrong with 
your eyes? Did you get an 'F' at school?
How's life? How's 
our young bride?
I improved her hairdo a bit when
she came over, was she upset?
Why do you keep quiet, 
Uncle Vasiliy?
Well, you can be quiet
if you want.
Vasiliy, you're a good guy! How come
you're not ashmaed to do this?
Uncle Mitya, have you got
matches?
Could you spare me one?
You came for a visit 
or will you stay here?
I don't know how 
will they receive me.
Your lover doesn't give you money 
for matches! Good life!
Don't try to pique me, Nadya,
I came to talk things over, calmly...
Oh, look at him! I pique him!
Did you know that I ripped your
pigeons' noggins off? Totally!
- What's gotten into you?
- Hey, Lyonya, don't let him in!
Let me in! Lyonya!
I'll cut them off anyway.
You won't be able to do anything to me!
Lyonya, you are not serious, 
are you?
- And who are you?
- Hey! How do you talk to your Father! 
Lyonya, what's wrong with you? 
I am your Father!
Look at him! 
- Take off your pants!
- Yeah, sure! Aren't we too fast?
Take off your pants, I told you!
Hitting your own Father!
- Have I ever hit you in your life?
- Why did you hurt Mum? 
Why have you come? Why did
you hurt Mum?
- Have you seen the state she's in?
- Well, I saw...
Ah, you saw? You saw?
Lyonya, what's gotten into you, hey?
At your own Father?!
Well, go on, son, go on!
Go on, chop it off, Sonny!
Put an end to your Father!
- Daddy!
- Go on, chop it off!
Hey, hey, sweet girl, you'll strangle
me, be careful!
Chop it off, sonny!
- I will never forgive you!
- Daddy!
What have you done to Mum? 
How could you?
- I will never forgive you!
- Go on, chop it off!
Sonny! Go away!
Lyonya, what has come into you?
You have hit me, I never
laid a finger on you!
Go away! Go away!
- Nadya, don't cry!
- Go away from here!
- Why did Lyonya do that?
- Go away!
Oh, don't tear me apart, Jesus!
- I will never forgive him for that!
- Go away from here!
All right, calm down, 
that's enough.
Well, go away now. 
Go!
- I understand... Nadya, forgive me.
- Don't come closer!
I wanted all to be better.
You were mischievous and now
you're complaining.
Why did he come upon me with an axe!
What was he doing!
Leave it be.
- Nadya, I still have money left...
- Go and choke on it!
Aha, ok, all right.
Tellingly, Lyonya hasn't approved
your actions.
Well, yes, I was wrong. But why
the axe?
Well, that was foolish.
When Lyonya took that axe, I
thought I'd give birth.
- Where is?.. - Who? 
- That axe. 
Lyudka threw it into the garden.
Oh. I'll go and hide it.
- Aunty Shura, run to him, to Vasiliy.
- Why?
Tell him 
that I'll wait for him 
near the old ferry.
What do you mean?
Did you see, he was all white and then 
blotchy. 
He's distressed as well for sure. 
He's punished himself.
Do not cry. I'll go.
Take this away.
I caught up with him. He stood there 
shaking.
I told him and he nodded. He nodded
his head, yes he did.
He was all quiet.
- He’ll wait for you the day after 
tomorrow. - I won't go!
- Wut?
- Nought.
Look at him, went to a resort and 
turned into a lover-boy!
I felt sorry in the beginning, 
stupid me. 
But now not anymore! He'll find 
himself another one, now he knows how.
Nadya, so this is it? You'll
just be like that, at odds?
Nadya, he's a good man, he doesn't drink
and works hard!
Will you find someone like him? No!
Oh, damn them all! I don't need anyone!
When Mitya accosts me, I can't
hold it! I feel such pity for him!
And you, you're young, why 
should you suffer?
I won't go!
So just sit here! From now on I'm 
also at odds with you.
You have no pity neither for the 
children, nor for him, nor for yourself.
After I die I'll invite Vasiliy to the 
funeral banquet, but I won't let you in!
I won't go!
So, Vasiliy, here I am.
You're here!
So what will you tell me now?
- How's Lyonya?
- He's all right! Says, he'll kill you.
He'll kill me? Well, all right.
- Nadya, dear, maybe let's sit down?
- Let's sit down.
Sit down, Nadya, dear.
Sit down.
Wait! Just a moment!
I have a newspaper.
Like so. Yeah, sit down.
It's getting chilly.
You've brought 
some vodka with you or what?
I did! Just a second.
All armed and prepared, ha?
No... If you don't... I...
Oh, all right, pour it!
- Are we to look at it now?
- Just a second.
Wait... Just a sec.
Some snacks.
Go on!
- What's that? Have a bite!
- Don't drink too much.
Just a tiny bit.
- Oh, son of a gun!
- Wut?
Nadya, dear, I feel mighty 
shitty without you.
I'm a fool...
Well, if you don't need pigeons, to 
hell with them, I'll chase them away
Fiddle sticks!
I'm as restless as an insomniac bear, 
my mind is wondering 
somewhere all the time.
- Life is such a...
- Oh, stop swearing!
Why did I muck about 
with those pigeons...
It has rushed into your head,
so you were mucking about.
- What are you talking about!
- Nothing! Such a shame!
All men are like real men and this one
races over the roofs with the teenagers.
I was so ashamed I couldn't look
people in the eyes!
You'd like it more if I wasted my time
playing cards?
I didn't say that. Those guys play poker
like crazy every evening after work,
you race over the roofs, what's the
difference? Both are addictions!
Why are you blabbering if you 
don't know?
Oh, but you undersand all the knowledge!
Your brain is so big that it
sticks out from your ears!
Go to that resort girlie and tell her,
I do not need to be taught! 
What does this have to do with it?
What's it got to do? They were curing 
their locomotive system! My ass!
If only someone cut off those 
limbs of yours,
so that you coldn't do all 
those foolish things you did!
You've made a mess and now 
you regret it, I see that.
I go home from the shops, all
shivering.
I come near gates and think 
that you're not there, 
so what is there for me to do?
Nadya, I wasn't thinking!
I'll die, Nadya.
Nadya, I'll die for you, not for myself.
Let them cut me into pieces or ...
I hurt you. I am ready to repay for it,
with anything,
 with my life, if you want!
Nadya, forgive me, please, 
forgive me!
- Vasiliy, my sweetheart!
- Nadya, sweetheart!
Vasiliy, dear, what are you doing?
Right here, right now? They'll see us!
I woke up in the morning and cooked
this for you while the kids were asleep!
Eating in the canteen
isn't much fun.
I almost bumped into Lyonya.
I think he hasn't noticed.
Jeez....
I met Aunt Shura in the street. 
She was smiling. 
I asked her why and she said
that if I were happy, she was happy too.
- Maybe she has learnt that we see each
other? – But how?
- Maybe somebody told her?
- But who knows about it?
- Maybe she read it from your face?
- My face?
You now, I really try to frown when I
am with other people.
Well, you can try as hard as you like, 
but your eyes, they're sparkling!
Eat up, eat!
- Finish your food first.
- Well, I did.
You behave as if we were on a honeymoon 
again. Where does this energy come from?
Calm down, you crazy!
I'll cry!
Oh, you crazy! 
Get off me!
- Ah, maybe it was good that she was
 in our life. - Who?
That marriage-wrecker, 
that ratty Raisa of yours!
Why do you have to start again?
We lived and worked, 
while misfortune
was lurking behind our gates like a dog.
But maybe it wasn't misfortune, if 
it has shown me the truth.
What has it shown you?
How much I love you, 
how much you love me,
what wonderful kids we have.
But our kids are really wonderful, 
for sure!
You're right, Vasiliy.
I hadn't thought before that you can
just disappear!
I have never thought abou it!
And now I think about everything: 
about war, 
about those rotten capitalists.
Oh, Vasiliy, what do they want from us?
Well, as if there's nothing 
better to think about. 
- The war is ... - What is it? 
- It's a marriage-wrecker too! 
One gives birth and doesn't 
know what awaits a child!
What kind of life will they have?
Who will decide their fate?
- Giving birth is not our concern 
anymore! - Don't be so sure!
Whoa!
Yeah!
In the beginning I couldn't understand. 
Then I got scared.
And now I don't know what to think.
Holy Moly, dear mother....
- What a thing to do!
- Well, it was you who did it.
Well, we both did it, Nadya!
Oh, Nadya, my dove!
This is what it does!
This is what love does!
Nadya, let me kiss you!
Oh, get off, Vasiliy!
Vasiliy, I am afraid. What will people 
say? That I went crazy in my old age...
Oh, let them talk! You are younger 
than those youngsters nowadays!
Let those youngsters try!
They will bloody fail!
- Vasiliy, dear, it is 2 months!
- How do you know?
What do you mean? We've been hiding here
for 2 months already.
Enough! We've been underground enough, 
we need to come out!
- People will laugh at us!
- No they won't! My wife is pregnant!
Stop running to those dates, you'll 
catch a cold and what am I to do then?
Nadya, quit it and go home!
- You'll be cold.
- Nah, don't worry, it's warmer now.
- What about the smoke?
- Just exhale sideways.
What, you can't hold anymore?
Go and coo to them.
Oh, Nadya... Let me 
finish this cigaret first.
Well, go, I tell you!
- Well, well. - It drinks! It remembers!
- Interesting!
Will it drink from mine?
Let's try! Get some water.
But don't laugh, Nadya,
don't laugh.
- Why are you laughnig?
- And why did you say not to laugh?
Well, get some water. Move closer
to the pigeon 
and coo a bit. 
Push water, push it!
Nadya, what's that?
A bird and yet not afraid. Amazing!
- Mum, where are you?
- Could it be Lyonya?
Why is he so early?
What should we do now?
- Quiet! I'll slip through the backyard.
- Backyard? Without your pants?
Fiddle sticks!
I told you, get dressed, but no!
'It's warm now, it's warm'!
But it's really warmer, Nadya!
- Stay put.
- Yep.
Lyonya, aye, Lyonya!
I'm here. You've come already?
Go get me some water if you're here.
Well, there is a whole tub 
in the bathhouse.
- Where?
- I filled it yesterday.
I wanted to do the washing today.
- Well, use it.
- Lyonya...
Mum, go and fetch Dad. 
Stop hiding!
Who's hiding, I wonder!
If I only met him....
- It's ok, I saw him!
- Where?
- Near the river. And you kiss 
like kids! - You and your imagination.
- They will take me to the Army.
- Who? – Well, guess.
- When?
- Tomorrow at 7 am.
- What about health examination?
- I passed. – Why didn't you tell me?
When should I? You're too busy
being in love.
- What branch of service will you 
go to, Sonny? - Border guards.
Oh, it's quiet there now!
Sure, quiet!
- Well, tell her?
- What should I tell her, Sonny?
To stop crying!
Stop crying! Get some snacks 
and nibbles, quick.
Oh, my Sonny!
Let her get over it a bit.
- We probably should call Mitya and 
Aunt Shura. - Just a moment!
Dad!
Put on your trousers.
Oh, fiddle sticks!
Bah! Well, I wanted to get 
a bathhouse going...
- Who else is conscriped with you?
- Sashka Buldanov, Mishka Roiden, Vova
- Filimonov? 
- There will be a whole team!
Oh, that's good! You won't be bored. 
Help each other!
Run to the store and buy what's
necessary, we'll buy more if needed.
And some bread! Run, Sonny!
Dad, there is a broom, 
behind the bathhouse on the wall.
And you were afraid. 
One has to understand!
See, what a fine lad we've brought up!
And now look at me.
And look at you! Buttons!
You're not a proper soldier!
In the army they'll give you 
45 seconds during the operational alert.
Troopers.
- Lyonya, what's wrong with you?
Don't interrupt! He's going through
basic military training!
Daughter, go and do your stuff!
Don't interrupt us!
Ok, say good-bye to your bottom.
Your head! 
Flatwise! You need to 
be flat!
When I was serving, 
the officer would put up a rope
if one touched it with a bum – 
extra duty.
When I was serving, they were putting
barbed wire.... The Germans...
If anyone touched it, a mine 
would explode...
It ain't your extra duty!
Why don't you dance?
The old people are dancing
and you are sitting!
Come on, Vasiliy, 
come on!
- Dad, let the pigeons fly for 
a farewell! - Yes, let's go!
Sonny, while you're there see to it 
that no pest gets into our lands...
Oh, come on! Noone will attack us!
Don't panick!
- But they did! - Yeah, they did, 
but we showed them!
Well, your brother will go 
and serve in the army, 
but we'll provide you with another one.
Dad, what are you talking about!
Olya, don't listen to him!
Oh come on! Everyone knows it already.
Sasha, maybe we should go and chip us
some Snowwhite? 
Oh, be quiet, you carpenter!
Where do you go, crazy ones, 
you'll crash!
- I don't see them! Where're they, Olya?
- Above your head. Look right above you.
- Show her to him, 'cause he won't see.
- Nah, let them rise a little bit higher
He lost us. You've waited
too long.
Oh, my neck!
- That's enough. Vasiliy, let's 
have a drink. - Nah, Uncle Mitya.
He understands that she's here. 
Where would he go without her?
There he is!
He's flying! Look everyone!
He's flying!
Oh, life!
Like a stone, like a stone!
Oh my God...
That's all, folks.
That's all...
That's all
