LIKE THE SONG GOES...
"THE DAY I WAS BORN".
TO THINK "SHE" WAS ME...
VANITY OF VANITIES.
FEED CROWS
MY MOTHER AND I.
MAITE'S MOUTH OPEN,
LIKE ALWAYS
I love you, I love you...
I want you.
You are tickling me,
Anselmo...
Be patient, Anselmo.
Love... my love...
I love you...
I love you more than anything
else in the world...
I love you... kiss me...
my dearest...
Anselmo.
Anselmo.
What's wrong?
Anselmo.
I can't breathe...
I'm choking...
Anselmo!
Anselmo!
Oh, my God...
My God...
Daddy...
Daddy...
What are you doing here?
I can't sleep.
I see.
You can't sleep.
Do you know what time it is?
It's terribly late.
Come on, to bed.
Goodnight.
Look what I've brought you...
You're a real glutton...
Rosa. When is my First Communion?
I don't know. You'll still
have to wait a couple of years.
Your turn now, Ana.
Come on.
"l teach myself, lady hake."
"Let's see if
it works..."
Let me do it, Rosa.
What happens if I bite
your neck?
And... what if
I kiss your neck?
And... what if
I bite you here again?
And... what happens if
I kiss your ear?
Very loud.
Ana... Ana!
May I know what you're
thinking of?
Is it true than my mother
always wore this cross?
Of course.
Grandma gave it to her.
This cross keeps the devil away.
And the vampires too.
Ready! They are ready, miss!
Let's see.
At least they look decent.
Thanks, Rosa.
Behave yourselves.
Irene, come here.
First thing when you enter
the room, you kiss your father.
Then you pray for his soul.
Understood?
Understood, Ana?
Come on now, Maite.
-When is my First Communion?
-Not now!
I was sleeping quiet
when I heard voices.
When I got into the room
I saw he was dead.
-And then Mummy appeared.
-Mummy is dead, Ana.
Thank you very much.
You're the eldest, lrene,
you first.
Now you, Ana.
Come on, Ana.
Come on!
-I don't want to.
-We'll talk later.
Now you, Maite.
Take her.
I can't reach him.
One day that my mother was
cleaning the house,
she took a metal box out
of the wardrobe
and gave it to me
saying:
"Throw this out, Ana,
it musn't be here."
Besides, it's useless now.
I asked her
with curiosity
what was inside it.
She said it wasn't my concern.
I asked her if
it was poison
and she told me smiling,
"Yes, a horrible poison.
You can kill an elephant
with just a spoonful of this powder."
And then she said,
"Come, come, throw it out".
I was very shocked
and I don't know exactly
why I didn't listen to my
mother and kept the box.
Because I wanted to kill
my father?
I've asked myself that question
100 times
and all the answers
I can think of now,
twenty years afterwards,
are too easy
and unsatisfactory.
The only thing I remember
clearly
is that I was then convinced
that my father was responsible
for the sadness
that embittered the last years
of my mother's life.
I was convinced
it was only him
who provoked her illness
and death.
My mother...
According to the people
that knew her well,
my mother could have been
an excellent pianist.
Ever since she was a child
she showed a particular
gift for music
and everyone foretold
a brilliant future for her.
For many years
she devoted herself
to the piano
and she even played
in public concerts.
In one of them
she met my father.
They fell in love,
soon got married
and my mother gave up
the piano to devote herself
completely to us,
her daughters.
I think she always
missed those times
and regretted giving up
a profession
that could have been
a liberation for her.
Nevertheless I also
think now that
she feared becoming
just a mediocre player
despite all the prophecies.
And so she chose a quiet
and organized life
instead of facing such
a responsability.
Irene, no one ever taught you
how to eat properly?
It's better to hold
the fork this way.
And it's easier.
Ana, please, the knife!
I wonder why you don't know
good table manners.
Maite, keep you mouth
shut when you eat!
Nobody taught me.
Don't be foolish.
Your parents never taught you
how to act at the table?
I always eat this way.
What did you say?
Nothing.
If you have anything to say,
say it clearly.
I dislike half words.
Irene, the fork.
Daddy never taught us
how to eat.
And what about your mother?
My sister never taught you
how to eat?
My mother died
before I was born.
Who told you that nonsense?
I ask you please to listen.
Following you father's will,
I've taken charge
of your education.
That means that from now on,
you are under my protection.
Grandmother
is also going to live
in this house and we'll both
do our best to give you
all you need.
You may find this hard
at the beginning,
but I'm sure
that if we all try,
we'll get on well,
isn't that so Maite?
I have to tell you
that I've found
the house a shambles.
From now on I want
things tidy,
and to achieve that, it's necessary
for all of you to make an effort.
I want the house to be ready
before the end of your vacation.
Can I count on your help?
May I leave the table?
Yes.
May I leave the table, aunt?
Of course!
I presume we'll get on well.
All men are the same,
all of them.
You'll realize when
you're a woman.
All want the same.
You are lost if you yield
to them.
Your father himself...
was quite a man.
He was mad about women.
I had to run away from him
more than once.
He really had wandering palms.
What a man...
I could tell you...
The quarter of Santa Cruz.
You're a red carnation.
You're my godess...
You gave me a burning kiss.
Ay Mari Cruz, Mari Cruz.
Ay Mari Cruz,
wonderful woman.
In the Santa Cruz quarter,
you're a red carnation,
you're my goddess,
you gave me
a burning kiss.
A burning kiss, Mari Cruz.
The woman who used
to I ive next door...
I can't help bursting
with laughter...
one day, suddenly,
she realized she was three
months pregnant.
Everyone kept asking her who
the father was but she wouldn't say.
She swore time and again
she hadn't slept with anybody.
She said... Do you understand
what I'm saying?
-Not a thing.
-Well...
Here...
Hold this end.
That's it...
She said that one day
she was walking by a building site
and something fell inside her blouse.
She felt something inside her
clothes. Do you know what it was?
A mouse.
She said that mouse
was her baby's father.
Have you got anything
for Roni?
How can you have
such an animal!
Give me lettuce.
Take some from the fridge,
but not too much.
What floor is it?
-The third floor.
-But they're on vacation.
-Did you send him the letter?
-Yes, but he didn't reply.
-He doesn't love you.
-What do you know?
-You're a fool.
-You're the fool.
Look at Roni so soft
and chubby.
Lovely little thing.
Maite...
Maite, honey...
What do you want?
Look for some.
Is this any good?
Do you know who is downstairs, Ana?
That good-looking friend of Daddy's.
And this one?
Yes, yes. Mark it.
Turn the music down.
I'm going now.
Where are you going?
I have dozens of things to do.
I'll be back before Rosa.
Take care of your grandmother.
Especially you, lrene.
Can we go with you?
Not now. I'm in a hurry.
You're the eldest, lrene,
and the wisest.
If anybody phones, say
I'll be here in a couple of hours.
All right?
Be good.
Do you want to dance?
I think grandma's calling.
What a nuisance!
I'll go.
Poor thing, nobody
cares about you.
They leave you here
on your own.
Let's go!
Do you want to see
the photographs
or do you want the prayer book?
You want to see the photographs.
Anything else?
I'll put the song on.
Are you coming with us,
Ana?
Where?
Come on, don't be so boring.
I'm not boring.
You're the boring one.
-May I come with you?
-Yes.
All right.
Does it suit me?
Help me!
-Too big for you.
-lt doesn't matter.
I shall never wear this.
You won't be able to run.
-Why not?
-Because...
Give me the broom.
How are you, dear?
You are late.
What have you been doing up
till 1 1 :00 in the evening?
Please, don't start again,
I'm dead tired.
I've had an awful day.
Indeed! You can't lie to me.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Don't start again. I come home
looking for a little rest.
You're upsetting my life.
Oh, God! What have I done?
Don't try to fool me,
hypocrite...
Do you think I'm stupid or what?
I know very well who
you've been with.
You've been with... with Rosa.
-With Rosa?
-Yes, with Rosa.
Nonsense. You and
your stupid jealousy.
I love only you, but sometimes
my patience comes to a limit.
This is going to finish.
You'll soon see.
The children, please,
Amelia.
They are asleep. And anyway,
I don't mind if they wake up.
They'll learn who their
father really is.
A rascal. That's what you are.
Stop talking, Amelia,
please.
I shout as much as I please.
Who do you think you are?
Gosh!
What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-We were playing.
I'm playing the maid.
Come here, Ana!
What's that behind you?
Give it to me.
My wig.
And you used my rouge.
You too, lrene.
Go to the loo
and wash your faces.
Hurry up!
And don't do it again.
So you played the maid
didn't you, dearie?
Hands up.
Fine.
We'll spend next weekend
in the country.
How's that?
Super. But where?
In Nicolas Garate's villa.
You know who he is?
The one who was in the garden
the other day.
Amelia's husband.
Take your trousers off.
Have you ever been there?
We went once with mummy and daddy.
There were horses...
a pine grove, and
I think also a river.
It's a splendid property.
We'll have a lovely time,
you'll see.
And off...
The other leg...
Have your bath now!
It's burning.
We'll cool it down.
Don't be a naughty girl.
Come on, Maite.
Crouch down.
Crouch down, Maite.
Now your head.
Maite, my dear.
Nicolas was your father's
best friend. A very good man.
They were both
in the Army together.
Amelia was with Daddy
when Daddy died.
What did you say?
Amelia was in bed with Daddy
when he died.
Let's see.
Tell me that story.
Amelia was with your father...
Are you being serious?
Who told you that?
Ana saw them together in bed.
Teller!
I understand.
You saw...
What did you see?
I didn't see anything.
Of course not!
Telling lies is horrible!
Some lies can do a lot of harm.
You're still too young to realize
the seriousness of certain things.
What's it all about?
One day Daddy said to Mummy
that Amelia was very pretty.
Mummy said that she wasn't
that beautiful.
I think Amelia
is very pretty.
Very pretty.
That's true.
I can't understand
how some people say...
childhood is the happiest
time of one's life.
It certainly wasn't for me
and that maybe is
why I don't believe
either in a childlike paradise
or in the innocence of children.
I remember my childhood
as a long
interminable and sad time,
filled with fear.
A fear of the unknown.
There are things
I cannot forget.
It seems unbelievable how memories
can be so... so strong.
So strong...
My mother was ill in bed.
At the time I didn't know
that her illness was incurable
nor that she had been
sent home
from the hospital to die.
My two sisters were with
aunt Paulina and grandmother,
who didn't live with us then.
My father was out.
I don't know where.
And Rosa acted as a nurse.
I want to talk
to the doctor.
It's very urgent!
It's from Rosa.
Yes, doctor,
it's Rosa here.
She's very ill.
Come as soon as possible,
please.
She's suffering a lot.
I don't know what to do.
Yes, at nine o'clock.
It's all a lie.
Nothing exists.
Nothing exists.
They've cheated me.
I'm afraid.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I'm afraid.
I don't want to die.
It hurts.
It hurts!
It hurts.
It hurts!
Clam down. They're going
to give you an injection.
-Rosa!
-lt won't hurt anymore.
Come on, please...
It hurts.
What are you doing here?
Go and play.
Ana...
What are you doing here?
I don't feel sleepy.
You don't feel sleepy?
Have you tried counting sheep?
I see.
May I stay with you?
Do you know what time it is?
It's very late.
I don't feel sleepy.
Why don't you play that song?
This is not the time
to play the piano.
Please, Mummy.
All right.
But you'll have to go
to sleep afterwards.
Really?
You promise?
Yes, I promise.
The song you like...
is this one, right?
Not really?
I don't know.
Blow.
Here.
Is that the one?
What about your promise?
Off to bed now...
Give me a kiss.
Another one.
Kiss me like in the movies.
Now like the eskimos.
And now kiss me...
-Like a bear!
-A bear!
Listen, she-bear, to bed.
Come on!
That's enough of bears.
Are you still up?
I told you I would be back late.
-Go to bed.
-I can't sleep.
I was waiting for you, Anselmo.
I want to talk to you.
If you don't mind, we'll talk
tomorrow. I'm going to bed.
We have all day tomorrow to chat.
I don't want to chat
all day tomorrow.
I want to talk to you now.
What about?
I don't know.
Tell me what you've done.
Did you have a good time?
Yes, very good.
A very good time.
I can't go on.
I can't go on, Anselmo.
I've reached the limit.
I can't go on.
Stop talking nonsense, Maria.
What you have to do is
to find some pastime.
-I don't want a pastime.
-You can't sit here all day.
I want to be dead.
I want to die.
I want to be dead.
Come on, Maria.
Take it easy.
I'm sick.
-I'm sick.
-Nothing is the matter with you!
Nothing, absolutely nothing!
Help me.
Help me, I'm sick!
How can I help you
if I don't know what you've got?
Tell me about yourself.
I'm on my own all day...
Love me!
Love me!
I'm ill!
Here we go again!
Your wretched illness!
-You're not!
-I'm ill!
I told you I won't
let you blackmail me.
You just want to ruin my life.
Listen. I'm sick
of complaints and accusations.
I am the way I am,
so leave me alone!
Ana...
What are you doing, Ana?
Where are you coming from?
Tell me, where are you
coming from?
I went to have a drink of water.
Why did you go to the kitchen?
I was thirsty.
Come on! Go to bed!
Goodnight, Ana.
Goodnight, aunt Paulina,
sleep well.
I'll leave the light on
in the corridor.
Call me if you need anything.
Sweet dreams, Ana.
You're a naughty girl.
You always sleep
with the blanket off.
Goodnight, Mummy.
Still awake?
I can't sleep.
You can't sleep?
Have you tried counting sheep?
I see.
-May I stay with you?
-Yes.
Shall I tell you a story?
Yes. "Little Almond".
"Little Almond"?
Let me think...
Once upon a time,
in a distant country
there was a very small girl,
so small that she looked
like an almond
and they used to call her
Little Almond.
One day,
when she was sleeping in her bed...
Little Almond woke up.
Her bed was very small too.
Mummy!
Mummy!
Mummy!
What's up?
Mummy!
-What's wrong, Ana?
-Mummy!
Go to your bed.
What's wrong with you?
Calm down, nothing's happened.
Calm down.
What's wrong? You had a dream.
What's wrong, Ana?
I want to die.
I want to die.
-I want to die.
-Don't be silly.
You were dreaming.
You had a nightmare.
I'm going to tell you a story.
Don't you want me to?
Let's see...
Which story shall I tell you?
Oh, I know, "Little Almond".
Once upon a time
in a distant country,
there was a girl who was so small...
I want you to be dead.
How can you say such a thing?
I want you to die.
I want you to die!
You're wicked because you don't do
what you should do.
And you make aunt Paulina,
Rosa and my sisters suffer.
You're wicked because
you don't do what you should do.
You're disobedient
and you're a thief.
One day you took away a pen
from your friend Sofia.
Not all my memories
of that period are sad.
Among my happiest recollections,
I remember
one in particular:
that weekend.
To tel I the truth...
I can't think why
it has remained so vividly
engraved on my mind.
I don't know but
I found myself free,
new, different.
On that trip I was wearing
a pair ofjeans
with flowery pockets
and a flowery blouse
and red buttons
and a navy blue cardigan.
Aunt Paulina drove.
Irene had the front seat
because she was the eldest.
Maite and I sat in
the back seat.
-How are you? Was the trip fine?
-Hel lo! How are you?
Hello, pretty one.
Don't be afraid of the dog.
Don't be afraid.
How are things?
Hello, my sweet.
Are you afraid of the dog?
Figaro, here!
The property owned by Nicolas
and Amelia
was magnificent.
A heaven of peace which
seemed to be out of this world.
It was difficult to
keep up a property like that.
Later, they sold it
and came to Madrid.
Congratulations for your cook.
-lt was a great meal.
-Fantastic.
But you never cook yourself?
No, I'm terrible at it!
I now understand why my father
was fascinated by that woman.
Amelia was a very warm woman,
affectionate
and sensual.
Every time she smiled
her face shone...
And she had very dark skin
which one felt
like touching.
Irene, why don't you
go out to play?
I'm reading.
Irene...
Do you like the book?
It's yours,
but on one condition.
What condition?
You all have to go out
and play.
Enjoy the fresh air,
there's none in Madrid.
Go on!
What do you say?
Thank you.
Let's go, Maite.
No cheating and don't look.
1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20!
Ready or not, here I come!
I've seen you,
come out, I've seen you.
In which tree?
That one.
Come out, Maite,
and don't cheat.
You have to die now.
Come on, die!
I saw you, lrene.
You're behind the bushes.
Come out...
and die.
I'm dying.
Guardian Angel,
my sweet companion,
do not leave me alone
or I will be lost...
revive my sisters
lrene and Maite.
Let's go, Maite.
You coudn't live here?
It would be a hustle
to go every day from here.
-Go with your sisters!
-I want to be with you!
Did you quarrel?
Yesterday it took me
only 35 minutes.
Go and play with your sisters.
Have you seen
how tall Ana is?
Time flies.
It's been 8 years since we met
in Burgos. Remember?
How long were
you posted in Burgos?
Just enough time to study
at the Cavalry Academy.
Ana...
Go and look
for your father
and tell him we have
to be in Madrid by 9 o'clock.
You're all wet,
pissy girl.
Now your corset,
and don't give me a dirty look,
I don't like that.
It's not your time yet.
Yes, yes, I know what you want.
But you'll have to wait.
You're impatient,
that's what you are.
Come on.
You're biting me.
What a girl!
Greedy, you're really greedy.
Rosa, do children have any hair
when they are born?
It depends.
You know by the pains.
With Jacinto I had
the most horrible pains.
When the mother has a lot of pain,
the child will be hairy.
-How many sons did you have?
-Four. The last one died.
I know the one who is in Germany.
That one, Maria,
who lives in Barcelona, and Jacinto.
Don't you remember him?
We saw him in the village.
No, I can't remember him.
You have to put it on this way.
Let me do it. See?
You got it?
I remember when you were born.
Your father was very annoyed.
Three daughters.
They had to use forceps
to get you out!
What's that?
You didn't want to come out
so they had to force you.
The doctor, the anesthetist
and the midwife.
They couldn't get you
out of your mother's womb.
How about that?
If you look carefully
in the mirror,
you'll see some marks here.
Here?
Your mother wanted to breast
feed you
but she was too pale and delicate.
So the one who really reared
you was me.
-Did you breast feed me?
-Oh, no. With a bottle.
You've got a big bosom,
why don't you show it to me?
Do you think this is the circus?
Show it to me.
I'll count up to five.
One... two...
three... four...
and five.
How big!
Let's see what that old hag wants.
This one?
This one then, isn't it?
Do you want a closer view?
Is that Mummy?
If it's not Mummy
who else can it be?
A sister?
Your mother?
A friend?
The postcard of the lake.
You were in Switzerland
with grandfather
when you were young.
And this hotel reminds you
of the honeymoon.
Sunrise over the lake
was beautiful. There were swans.
One could see the mountains
covered with snow.
This was your
window.
You...
You want to die?
Do you want me
to help you die?
Wait, I'll come back at once.
Look, I keep it here.
It's a horrible poison.
You can kill an elephant with
just a spoonful of this powder.
A terrible poison.
Fatal!
Don't you want it?
But a moment ago
you said you did?
Why not?
As you please.
Roni.
Roni.
Are you sick?
What's wrong?
Poor little thing.
Poor Roni.
I'll take care of you.
You'll get well very soon.
He's dead!
Take the picture.
In the name of the Father
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Our father which art in Heaven,
hallowed by thy Name...
-What happens when someone dies?
-Leave me alone!
Come on, I've done you
so many favours.
He just dies.
He dies?
I don't understand something:
How does one die?
I've no idea.
In the name of the Father...
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Your aunt is home?
I don't know. I think so.
Wash your face,
otherwise your aunt will get angry.
Thank you.
When I married her,
I made a mistake.
At the time I thought that
Iove could overcome everything
and that things would be all right.
I soon realized
how wrong I was.
Yes, my marriage has been
a total failure.
Everyone carries his burden
as best he can.
But I'm not prepared
to put up with it.
Certainly not!
Maybe I'm boring you
with my problems.
Not at all.
It's not important any longer.
Well, tell me,
what do you do?
Me? I don't do anything.
I stay at home all day.
As long as the children
don't go back to school.
I think you should go out
more often.
You just can't lock yourself up
between these walls all your life.
A woman like you,
still young...
Thanks, Rosa.
Where are the children?
We are tidying things up.
This house is out of control.
I've never seen such
a mess in my life.
If it wasn't for Rosa...
Anything else?
Don't touch the cupboard.
I'll do that myself.
-Any more tea?
-Thank you.
Get out of here!
When did the Spanish Civil War end?
I think it was in 1939.
What did Daddy do
during the war?
I'm not sure.
Your mother told me
that he volunteered.
And later fought
besides the Nazis in Russia.
There he was wounded in the leg.
Leave the gun
-where it was!
-It's mine.
Leave it where it was.
Daddy gave it to me one day.
Ask lrene, isn't that so, lrene?
He gave me this rifle
and gave Ana that gun.
And me the flag of the Legion.
Stop that nonsense.
Weapons are dangerous.
Don't make me angry.
Once mine always mine.
Don't be so silly. Ask your aunt
how she likes you keeping that gun.
Let's see what she says.
How could I forget?
It was in Burgos,
Summer 1965.
You were stationed there.
You still love me.
You've always loved me, Paulina.
I love you.
I've always been in love
with you, my darling.
Why don't you knock at the door?
The door was open.
What do you want?
Rosa says
that this gun is not mine.
What are you doing with that gun?
Put it down!
Leave it to me.
Let's see, Ana...
That's a boy's toy, isn't it?
Daddy gave it to me,
it's mine. Ask lrene.
Of course he gave it to you.
Can I see it?
It's very beautiful.
It's a Luger.
A Parabellum 38 calibre...
Come on, let me see it...
Let me see it,
just for a second.
Beautiful.
You don't have to worry.
It won't be loaded.
Look, you pull here...
I can't go on!
I can't go on!
I'll send them
to a boarding school!
Paulina, I love you.
Can't you turn the music down?
Dead.
Dead.
I want her to be dead.
-Ani. You're very sweet.
-Not at all, aunt.
I pricked my finger!
You're as clumsy as your mother.
Hold the needle properly.
Let me do it.
You have to hold
the needle like this, see?
You see?
Now you do it.
Every day you look more
like your mother.
How am I like her?
Sometimes you move like her.
Even when you talk
I feel I'm hearing her voice.
She had to suffer so much.
Because of her illness?
Not only that...
One day I'll tell you
a few things.
Your mother deserved a lot better.
She was a saint,
a real saint.
She used to tell me
everything.
And some of the things
were really shocking.
I remember one day
your father had to leave,
to Segovia, I think.
Your mother stayed up
all night waiting for him...
What are you saying?
Nothing, Miss, nothing.
I don't like your gossiping
about my sister.
She's dead and we ought
to leave her in peace.
Don't let's go on about it
in front of the girls.
You should know that.
Ana, come here.
I'd like to know something.
You remember your mother well,
don't you?
Yes, sometimes yes.
I don't want you to think
I'm taking her place...
What does that mean?
That I only want you to feel happy
in this house.
And not to miss anything.
But I can't give you affection
if you're not prepared to receive it.
It's not easy for me, Ana.
Not at all.
Rosa, go and look for Maite,
please.
She has to try the dress on.
You're trying to get rid of me.
Yes, I want to be left with Ana.
It only concerns her and me.
This is too much,
who does she think she is, the idiot!
-May I leave, aunt?
-No. You stay here until I say.
Do as you please!
Poor little thing.
Poor little thing.
Come on, girls, get up,
it's 7 o'clock. To school.
Come on.
Irene, don't pretend
you're still asleep. Come on.
-Come on!
-Leave me alone!
Hey!
I don't want to go to school.
-Me neither.
-What's this?
Do you think holidays last forever?
Don't tickle me.
Don't be so messy!
What a disaster!
What are these children doing?
-Good morning, aunt.
-Good morning, lrene.
-lrene, did you sleep well?
-Very well, and you?
Beautifully.
Good morning, Rosa.
Good morning, Miss.
Come on, Maite.
Here. That's my girl.
And you Ani,
did you sleep well?
So-so.
Take your shirt.
Only so-so?
Why?
Did you have any nightmares?
We walked through many streets...
suddenly we were in the countryside.
In the far distance
there was a dirty house.
Which seemed to be abandoned.
The car went up to it.
Two men got out,
one of them said:
How was the hunt?
The other said:
Very good, look what
I've brought you.
They took me out of the car
and pushed me into the house.
There was a dirty kitchen,
a very old pan
and a few other things.
Then they took me into
one of the rooms.
And locked me in.
Later they brought me some food.
I didn't eat it.
Because I thought
it had been cooked in that old pan.
They asked me my telephone number.
And I gave it to them
fearing that they would kill me.
They phoned but Mummy and Daddy
weren't in.
-But Mummy and Daddy are dead.
-Not in my dream.
They were looking for me.
The men said they would
ring again in a half an hour.
But if they weren't in
by then they'd kill me.
I was terrified.
Half an hour later
they phoned again.
They weren't in,
they still hadn't arrived.
So they said:
We have to kill you now.
They tied me up
with rope to a wooden column.
And pressed a gun to my temple.
When they were about to shoot,
I woke up.
