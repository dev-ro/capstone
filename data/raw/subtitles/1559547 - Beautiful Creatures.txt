It's been the same dream
every night for months now.
I can't ever see her
face, but I know her.
Like I've known her all my life.
And it feels like something
terrible is gonna happen
when I reach her.
But at the same time,
I'm not scared at all.
I want her...
No matter what happens.
But I never get to her.
And then I die.
At first I was scared
I was losing my mind...
Till I realized that
would be no great loss.
I start junior year tomorrow,
so insanity is inevitable.
What's worse is waking up every night
wanting someone I've never met,
loving a girl who doesn't exist.
I've been stuck my whole life in Gatlin,
South Carolina's least-famous
middle-of-nowhere.
By the time we get a
movie, it's already on DVD.
And our theater always
gets the titles wrong.
We're too far away from
Charleston to have a Starbucks.
How sick is that?
We have 12 churches and one library,
with more banned books
than books to read.
Same damn families have
lived here for generations.
They keep reenacting the Civil War
like it's gonna turn out different.
Mama used to say
there's only two kinds
of people in Gatlin --
The ones too stupid to leave
and the ones too stuck to move.
Dad can't leave his room since she died.
People said it was god's will.
I think it's the only way
people ever get out of here.
I can understand why young men
signed up for the Civil War.
Anything is better than
a life standing still.
But I think even the
dead stay in Gatlin.
Sometimes it sounds crazy,
but sometimes I imagine I'm one of them,
fighting for the cause on
Honey Hill near greenbrier.
Ethan!
I imagine all kinds of things lately.
Sometimes...
I'm Billy Pilgrim,
from Vonnegut's banned
book "Slaughterhouse-Five."
"to be unstuck in time,
"in a constant state of stage fright,
never knowing what part of my
life I'd have to act in next."
I just love the sound of that.
Dad?
Dad?
I got breakfast.
Is this what we're wearing
our first day of school?
I'm a junior now, Amma.
If I dress like I care,
I lose credibility.
I thought you were getting a haircut.
- Who said that?
- I did.
Pay attention to the days
marked on these containers.
Thanks, Amma.
You decide what colleges
you're applying to?
All of them,
as long as they're a
thousand miles away from here.
Amen to that.
You go running last night?
Yeah.
Help you sleep any?
I envy people in comas.
Your father come out at all?
No.
...22.
"lying lips are abomination to the lord.
"now, when a wicked man dies,
his expectation shall perish;
And the hope of unjust men perisheth."
- Ow! Mom!
- You get away now!
Go on!
Come on. I got to take him to school.
Well, we have to finish these now.
Well, come on. You
know what happens --
We'll do them tonight.
Wesley, where are you going
without kissing your mother?
What is wrong with you, boy, hey?
Now, you be good.
- So, is she a good kisser or what?
- Shut up!
My mother has officially
flown that extra bat-shit mile
Since dad died.
And now she thinks the
end of the world is coming
'Cause of all these
earthquakes in the news.
It's like, how does loving
Jesus make that woman so crazy?
You know, she damned daddy
to hell so many times,
I bet you he drank just
so he'd get there quicker.
My dad is acting like old man Ravenwood.
They're all bat-shit.
Hey, did you hear that new girl
in our class is a Ravenwood?
I thought old man Ravenwood
lived in that house all alone.
Yeah, he did, but it's
his niece from out of town.
She just moved here.
Why would anyone want to move here?
I don't know.
It'll be the first Ravenwood
anybody in Gatlin's seen
in almost 20 years.
How was your summer, sugar?
Fine, Emily. And yours?
Wonderful.
Why didn't you go to
the labor day carnival?
It was such a good time.
I wasn't up for it.
I don't...understand what's happened.
I know you don't.
I'm sorry.
You said to give you
the summer, and I did.
I didn't hear from you
once, but I was a good girl.
I didn't call.
But I missed you.
Hey, no big deal, right?
How's about you and I go
see a movie or something?
Just us.
Oh, that would be just heaven.
Sure.
Everyone, take your seats.
Ethan, baby, I really
wish you'd quit reading
those kind of books.
They're bad for your mind.
As a requirement of this course,
you will need to select
a topic for a term paper
based on materials covered
in chapters 12 to 24.
Is that her?
Must be. What is she wearing?
She looks like death eating a cracker.
Just take any seat, miss, uh, uh...
Ravenwood.
Isn't it?
Mama says nobody's
seen old man Ravenwood
leave that creepy house in years.
Mama says it's 'cause
he's a devil worshiper.
Actually, it's Duchannes.
Well, uh, now, that's
an out-and-out lie.
I happen to know for a fact
that you're Macon Ravenwood's niece.
Well, bless your heart, sugar.
You must have been first in your litter.
Mama says devil
worshipers hate fresh air.
Makes them choke.
Well, we all know what makes you choke.
That's enough, Mr. Lincoln.
And that hat's gonna
look nice on my cat.
He's such a fool!
This year,
you will participate in
the annual reenactment
of our glorious victory:
the Battle of Honey Hill.
Ethan?
The reenactment will be held
on the day of the
battle, December the 21st.
Even though that is the
middle of Christmas break,
you will be expected to
participate wholeheartedly.

Are you nuts?! You almost killed me!
What were you doing
standing in the damn road?!
I need help, genius!
Forget it!
Wait, wait, wait!
I'm sorry! Look, get in!
This is a-- this is a shortcut.
Nobody comes down this road.
You'll drow-- is this
old man Ravenwood's car?
You're one of them,
aren't you? What are you?
The all-American jock
star, prom king...jock?
Look, can you insult me in the car?
It's getting a little
"titanic" out here.
You know, I never understood
why Leo had to die in the end.
Like, why couldn't they take turns?
"you float on the
wooden thingy 10 minutes,
I'll float on the wooden
thingy 10 minutes."
She kept saying, "I'll never let you go,
I'll never let you go,"
and then she lets him go!
If I get in the car,
will there be more of this
fascinating conversation?
'Cause I'd rather drown.
No. I got groceries back there.
I can't believe you told
me the ending to "titanic."
You've never seen it?
No.
You really are from outta town.
Hey.
Thanks.
You know where you're going?
Rarely.
Hey, I'm sorry about
those clichés in class,
but I'm not one of them.
"clichés"?
"girls who once were human,
but for whom absolute popularity
has corrupted absolutely."
Mm, bet you're real proud of
yourself thinking that one up.
You probably dated one of them.
You cut Emily like a surgeon.
Years working with the bitch virus.
No cure yet, huh?
We continue to research and hope.
- You been to a lot of schools?
- Yeah.
That must be nice. I
only ever lived here.
Must be nice.
So, where you all lived?
Pretty much every state
that seceded from the union.
Moved around since I was
4, after my parents died.
I only have my dad. My
mom died last spring.
How did it happen?
Fire.
Car accident.
That
was --
That was a dead-end conversation
on a road going nowhere.
I must have missed the
exit to "fascinating."
You, uh...
Bukowski? He-- he any good?
Define "good."
I can drive you up to
the house if you like.
- No. This is fine.
- No. I don't mind.
Look, I appreciate the ride,
but I don't feel like being a
haunted house attraction today.
No, I-- that's fairly
rude and not true at all.
Perhaps it's because we haven't
been properly introduced.
I'm Ethan Wate, by the way.
You're Ethan Wate?
Yeah.
Oh, my god. You mean
Ethan Wate drove me home?
You've heard of me?
No.
I like your charm necklace.
And-- and
your tat, too.
I mean, uh, also.
Thanks.
"some people never go crazy.
"what truly horrible
lives they must live.
"boring damned people.
"all over the earth.
"propagating more boring damned people.
"what a horror show.
The earth swarmed with them..."
This man is a god.
It is the name of our lord
that brings salvation.
It is the name of Jesus
that gives us authority
over evil spirits.
Protect us, lord.
What's going on? Here. Just wait for it.
Protect us from the devil
as we feel him approaching.
See, that been hitting
the same spot every night.
Since when?
Since Lena Duchannes came to town.
My mama heard she's
from a mental institution
because she killed a boy on
the train tracks in Atlanta.
- Oh, bullshit.
- Bullshit.
Watch your tongue!
Well, my mama said that
her mother killed her father
and then just left town like that.
Shut your mouth, Emily!
Ethan Wate, may I speak
with you for a moment?
Right now?
What is wrong with you?
I'm just sick of people in this town
putting down someone
they just don't know.
and you know Lena Duchannes?
Is that what you're saying, Ethan?
You know what?
I'm sorry, but I don't
think I'm gonna be able
to go to the movies
with you this weekend.
I think we need time apart.
And I'm sorry to hurt you.
Let's go.
Did I not say that to her
at the end of sophomore year?
Hey, some girls are just mad dogs, son.
You can either run or shoot.
Ethan? Ethan.
Can I talk to you about
something real quick?
I want you to know something.
I still care deeply for you as a friend.
And I pray every night that
you don't go straight to hell.
Oh, I-I won't go
straight to hell, Emily.
I wanna stop off in New York first.
Okay. Everybody take your seats.
Hi, darling. Good to see you again.
How's your mama?
Boys.
Billy, get down.
Okay, you should have
read this over the summer.
We're gonna start by discussing
the character of Boo Radley.
The town shut-in with
a mysterious past.
You mean Macon Ravenwood?
- Savannah!
- Excuse me?
Um, my mama says I-I really
shouldn't be reading this book.
This is one of those banned books.
Yes, well, I got permission
from the school board
to try it for a semester.
Oh, well, I'm not reading anything
that was banned from our church.
Me neither.
My mama also says that...
I shouldn't be in the
same class as a Ravenwood.
She says it ain't right
that they get to be
with us Christian kids.
Emily, shut up!
My mama says the same thing.
Says her whole family are Satanists.
They pray to Satan stark naked.
Dear lord...
Emily, what do you think you're doing?
You can't pray in class.
- Dear lord...
- Now, you stop it.
I humbly pray you protect
us from all things evil...
Girls, I'm telling you this
right now. You stop it now.
There are unnatural things
among us who serve...
I don't know what you're thinking.
...Christian believers.
Please, Jesus, help me!
Save me from
these evil --
She did it!
It was her! She broke the windows!
Why would she do something like this?!
You all right?
What the hell was that?
Lena?
Hello?
What are you doing here?
I-I just came to see if you were okay.
What for?
I don't know.
You okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
You can go now.
Go away!
No.
Yes!
No.
- Go!
- No.
Jerk!
Sorry about Emily.
She can be meaner than chickenshit.
Never understood that saying.
Yeah. Me neither.
And I should know better by now.
They always hate me,
no matter where I go.
Well, they're a mess of
fools. What do you care?
Never been "on the outside
looking in" your whole life,
have you?
Well, let me see if I can remember this.
It's Bukowski.
"some lose all soul.
"some lose all mind
and become soul, insane.
"some lose all-- all...mind..."
Hold on.
"some lose all soul and become mind."
"some lose all mind and become soul."
Oh, man.
I memorized this whole
thing to impress you.
Damn!
- You can't help it.
- What?
Fitting in anywhere, drooling charm.
I never know whether
you're insulting me or not.
I'm sorry.
No. Hey, I like it.
You know?
If it makes any difference, um...
I like you.
You may not think so later.
Pbht! Okay.
Uh, you can't complain
about not having any friends
and then make a guy work
this hard trying to be one.
Unless you actually do think I'm a jerk.
Then I'll just go.
Run and tell your
friends about the freak.
You really think I'm that guy?
No.
Okay.
I should get back.
You, uh, you read those chapters
in "to kill a mockingbird"?
Yeah. I've read it twice before.
Oh! It's good, isn't it?
Yeah.
You ever see the movie?
- No.
- Oh, it's good too.
We should watch it, actually.
You ever-- ever
read any Vonnegut?
No.
Kurt Vonnegut?
No? "Slaughterhouse-Five"?
He's great.
He's-- he's banned
too, actually.
You only read banned books?
Um, I don't only read banned books.
But, I don't
know, I just --
All the-- all the
books they let you read
Are, like, pretty boring, I guess.
Thanks. I'm
sorry I was --
Oh, I-It's okay. It's okay.
Look, you should go.
My uncle doesn't really like
people being around the house.
I know. I sort of, uh...went inside.
You went inside the house?
I didn't mean
to. I just --
I get it. People think he's scary.
But he's just Boo Radley shy, right?
Okay.
Hey, um...
I got you sort of a "welcome
to suckass Gatlin" gift.
I thought you could put it
on your-- on your chain.
Lena?
We have a guest?
He's leaving.
Hello, sir.
Manners? That's nice.
I-I-I go to school with
Lena. I'm Ethan Wate.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You Lila Evers' boy?
Yes, sir.
You knew my mother?
Lena, why don't you ask
your friend in for tea?
Tell him you can't stay.
I'd love to. Thank you, sir.
He's not scary.
Mr. Wate, make yourself comfortable.
Oh, I-I'm sorry about
walking in uninvited before.
No problem at all.
It's so rarely that we get visitors
from our...beloved Gatlin.
Don't be a snob, uncle.
It's not their fault you
never speak to any of 'em.
And it's not my fault
That I have a predilection
for good breeding,
reasonable intelligence, and
passable personal hygiene.
But since my family founded this town,
I have no alternative to call it home.
So...
There we are.
Oh, that's a beautiful piano.
Oh, yes.
Do you play?
No.
Lena, why don't you play
something for our guest?
'Cause we're not in a Jane Austen novel.
Then why don't you go make us some tea?
Again, wrong century.
Well, then, would it
disturb either of you
if I...ran my fingers
'cross the ivories?
I find it very therapeutic.
Uncle's upset.
School called.
Put me on probation
until the window thing
gets investigated.
That's crazy.
That was not your fault.
Voice of reason in a
town of buttermilk minds.
Lena, I could get to
like this friend of yours.
I mean, it's like blaming you
for the lightning on Honey Hill.
Oh, yes, I heard about the lightning.
In fact, a similar occurrence
took place in Venezuela
for many years at lake Maracaibo.
You can look it up on Google.
Uncle loves Google.
In any event, I'll sort
it out with the school.
But I understand your
indignation, Ethan.
Probation! Implies a
source of authority.
What is that source?
A bunch of sexually
frustrated housewives
with miniscule minds
and voluminous backsides.
No, there's only two kinds
of people in Gatlin --
The ones who are too stupid to leave
and the ones who are too stuck to move.
My mother used to say
that exact same thing.
Is that so?
She was a lovely woman, your mother.
I was so sorry to hear of her passing.
Of course, I only knew
her through her books.
I read everything she wrote
on the southern plantations.
You plan on being a writer?
I don't know yet. Maybe.
- What if I had a magic wand...
- Macon!
...and I could let you
see your whole future?
What would be there?
And don't spare me the gory details.
Well, sir, I'm not sure.
Um, one thing I do
know, though, is college.
I'm definitely planning on going.
Oh, really?
Where have you applied?
All of them.
As long as they're
not too far from home.
I mean, um, as long as
it's a local college.
Uh...uh, so I can stay with dad.
I-I'll get my teaching degree,
and-- and probably teach
at the high school...
Or maybe I'll take over
the library from Amma...
I-I'll probably marry Emily
Asher and we'll have two kids.
But I'll never make
enough money for her,
so I'll start drinking...
Get three duis and lose my job.
And, uh, have an affair on
and off with savannah snow
till I'm 49.
The kids will live with
their mother after we divorce.
Then, when I'm 52, I'll
have my first heart attack,
another one at 63.
I'll move into an apartment
above the wayward dog bar
and help them sweep up
after hours for free drinks.
And then when I'm 64, I'll hang myself.
Um, but they won't find
the body right away.
Not until I stink.
Well, you've got it all planned out.
Good for you.
Ethan, are you okay?
Yeah. Um, you'll have to excuse me.
I've not been sleeping too well.
What did you do to him?
I agreed to let you attend
what passes for a school in this town,
but no friendships.
Could you not at least let
me pretend until my birthday?
You remember what happened
at the last school?
This window shattering
is just the beginning!
That boy is a danger to you!
Don't invite him here again!
Oh, I wouldn't worry.
I'm sure he won't be back.
You came back.
Yeah. I-I'm sorry.
I don't know what the hell
happened to me in there.
It's not your fault.
I hope this doesn't sound weird,
but I think I've been dreaming about you
every night for months.
That did not sound
as creepy when I --
In my head.
Can you forget I said that?
Sure.
Okay.
Um...oh.
- Your present.
- Right. Great.
- The present.
- That's why I came back.
Uh, so it opens. See?
Um...e-c-w,
g-k-d.
December 21st, 1863.
December 21st?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
It's my birthday. I'll be 16.
Wow.
That's... That is amazing.
I don't-- you know, I don't
believe in signs usually,
but that-- that seems
like a pretty badass sign.
So y-you're 15 and you're a junior?
That's-- you
must be a brain.
You-- you
skip a grade?
Yeah.
Well, consider this an
early sweet 16 present.
- Ethan!
- Genevieve!
Genevieve! No!
Ethan!
Dad!
Dad?
Oh, Amma, what are you doing?
I'm looking for some
books your mother had.
I have to return them to the library.
- You all right?
- How did I get home?
What-- what are
you talking about?
When I got here, you
were already in bed.
Glad you're getting some sleep.
Amma! How did I get here?!
- Why are you shouting?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Heard you had trouble at school today.
My father always said
trouble follows that family
like stink on a fly's ass.
You better stay away from that girl.
You don't need to take care of us, Amma.
I promised your mother and I want to.
No, I d-- Amma.
I'm sorry. I just...
I don't think it's any of your business.
Where'd you get that?
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me.
What's wrong?
You listen to me.
You go and bury that in greenbrier
and forget you ever found it.
I never said I was in greenbrier, Amma.
My family's...different.
Different how?
We do things...
We do different things.
So, like, what, you're from Europe?
You know how some families are
musical and some have money.
Well, we have powers.
Powers?
Yeah.
What was that out there?
That was Macon.
He had the house "bound."
It's a spell to protect
me when he's not here.
A spell?
Yeah. It won't happen again.
Okay.
Lena...
Are you a witch?
No.
I mean, calling us "witches"
is like calling the smart kids "geeks"
or the athletes "jocks."
We prefer the term "caster."
I didn't mean to break those windows.
My powers are getting stronger.
I can't always control it.
You look nauseous.
You want a cookie?
The sugar will help.
I made these last night.
From a cookie mix.
Okay. What about this?
I don't know.
You don't know?
No. It wasn't me.
I mean, it was something else.
Something happens when we both hold it.
Okay. Hold on a minute.
Satan has nothing to
do with y'all, right?
That is such a mortal thing to say.
God.
Well, there is evil, Lena.
Yes, there are evil casters, Ethan.
I mean, are you trying to say
that there are no evil mortals?
Only difference is,
you all made up somebody
else to blame for it.
I'm just trying to figure this out.
So, you have powers, okay?
What else can you do?
I collect poetry.
I'm not meant to show
a mortal any of this.
It's okay.
No. I shouldn't have.
You know, I just hate
hiding all the time.
Feeling like everybody's
whispering about me.
Being afraid of people
finding out I'm this freak.
Sometimes you just want to be normal.
What are you smiling at?
Lena, you're a miracle.
Why would you ever want to be normal?
You're not what I expected.
What do you mean?
Don't get mad, but I've
dreamt about you too.
I just didn't think you were real.
Lena?
Oh, it's Macon. You've got to go.
Why didn't you tell me?
It scares me.
Doesn't it scare you?
You wanna go out with me?
Wait. Am I going out the window?
Whoa. Can you make anything grow?
- Lena?
- Get out.
Okay. How about Friday, movies?
Friday, I can't. It's a holiday.
What holiday?
It's a harvest thing. Family
coming from out of town.
Okay. Saturday.
Lena!
I don't know. Hurry up!
Say yes.
Yes.
Can I see you tomorrow?
I don't know. Get out of here!
Okay.
Ethan?
Yeah?
Promise me it'll be a really
normal, awkward teenager date.
I swear. I won't even call you after.
Jerk.
Witch.
Jock.
See you tomorrow.
You could have made a ladder, you know.
Keep your distance.
Thank you kindly for
your courteous welcome.
I felt something tonight.
I've been feeling something every night
since you brought that girl here.
Well, it's the only place
left I have to protect her.
So you bring darkness to this town.
I can feel it like a
hand twisting my insides.
Well, that's not Lena!
Sarafine?
You said she was gone for good.
Yeah.
Well, we...we did have
an agreement, but...
she's been shadowing
Lena for the past year.
And there have been some accidents.
Macon, no danger better come to that boy
because of your kind.
Yeah, well, then you
keep him on a leash!
What happened at greenbrier?
I don't know!
Lena was hysterical.
Boy was unconscious.
I brought him home, called you.
You're the seer. You
tell me what happened!
This is the sacred
place of my ancestors.
You hear?
You want some answers,
you show me some respect.
Yeah. I...i apologize.
Ethan had some kind of charm.
It had a Duchannes power in it.
Well, that would be Sarafine.
Maybe she's using the charm
to get to Lena through the boy.
You tell them I have to
know what Sarafine's up to.
You know, it wouldn't break your face
To ask for some help
instead of expecting it,
like your family's been doing
with mine for too many years.
Now, don't you roll your eyes at me.
Then please ask them kindly
what Sarafine is up to.
Brought your favorites, Uncle Abner.
Shrimp and grits.
Fried oysters.
And a coconut pie.
Hmm.
No wonder he's no longer with us.
Pay no attention to him, uncle.
Uncle Abner, we are in
need of your intercession.
Along with Aunt Ida and auntie may...
I humbly call upon your spirits.
What are they saying?
Nothing.
Nothing yet.
Tell them they have to
help us stop Sarafine.
"some things cannot be stopped."
This is your favorite spot?
It's all about the sign.
You see up there?
Mm-hmm.
That's the road to freedom.
My mama used to say,
"get out of this town
as soon as you can.
"go find out how other
people live and think
before you find a place that's yours."
And I'd say, "mom, um, I'm 9.
How do I do that?" little Ethan.
So that's when she
took me to the library.
And, um, she said,
"Ethan, this is my church.
"this is where my family goes
to celebrate what's holy --
Ideas."
Oh, wow. Sorry.
Don't know where that came from.
I wish I'd known her.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Where?
Anywhere.
Lena, most people
spend their entire lives
waiting for a moment that's
gonna change everything.
It never happens.
We can start our lives right now, okay?
We just got to say yes.
We just got to get in
the car and just go.
I can't do that.
Why?
When I turn 16...
I might not even be who I am now.
Why?
What-- what
could happen
besides getting your first hangover?
When a female caster turns 16,
we face what they call the claiming.
My powers will be claimed
for either the light or the dark,
depending on my true nature...
whatever I'm destined to be.
That's-- that's why
Macon brought me here.
Wait. What's Macon?
He's a dark caster,
but he's choosing to
be light for me now.
He can choose? Then why can't you?
They say that a female caster's
true nature chooses for her.
I don't know why.
Back up. Wait a minute.
You're worried that when you turn 16,
you're gonna be an evil...
Bitch...witch caster?
I have 75 days left, Ethan.
I don't know what I'll be.
I don't know who I really am inside.
Now, in the last year,
Lena Duchannes has been
in three different schools
in three different towns.
I-I checked.
And in every single one of them schools,
they had accidents, they
had unnatural weather,
they had... Well, they even had deaths.
Now, I have a petition here
signed by over 300 Gatlin
parents who demand...
Demand that Lena
Duchannes be expelled...
Excuse me. Excuse me.
...and furthermore that
the Ravenwood property be --
Oh, my god, mama.
Excuse me for my untimely intervention.
Principal Herbert.
Mayor snow.
And the Reverend Stephens, I believe.
Yes, sir.
Mm.
Mrs. Lincoln.
How dare you...
Enter the house of the lord?
Since my family own the
land it's built on...
And I understood this to be an occasion
for all members of the community.
Now, I'm sure y'all
have better things to do
on such a beautiful
day, so I'll be brief.
The accusations
against my niece --
All spurious lies.
For, according to
the weather channel --
And you can verify
this on Google --
There were unseasonably
strong gusts from the east,
which caused untold destruction
Up and down the South Carolina coast.
So my niece will go
back to the institution
that Gatlin presumes
to call educational,
and she will be persecuted no longer.
I thank you all for your cooperation.
You have no right to tell us what to do.
No matter how much money you have.
Oh, Mrs. Lincoln, you're right.
My wealth should offer me no advantage.
However, since my
ancestors founded Gatlin,
my holdings do give
me a little leverage.
For example, if I were
to donate the old mill
to, say, a drug rehabilitation center...
Oh, my god.
There again, I own the land
the wayward dog motel stands on.
Its closure would cause
a little inconvenience
to one or two of you gentlemen.
You'd have to travel out of
town to see your lady friends...
When your wives believe
That you are attending
yet another meeting
of the American Civil
War reenactment society.
So might I presume
that this matter is now
comfortably laid to rest?
I'm not afraid of you or your evil kind.
God our creator will
condemn you to hellfire
along with terrorists,
atheists, homosexuals,
Democrats, Liberals, Socialists...
Greenpeace and all the
other unnatural abominations.
My dear Mrs. Lincoln.
If I were you, I would
welcome any kind of fire.
Might give you the opportunity
to burn that unfortunate
hat you're wearing.
Sarafine.
Well, I would have expected to find you
in something a little more chic.
Oh, come on, Macon.
She's perfect!
She's a pillar of the community.
You're right about the hat, though.
Isn't it tragic?
But if you borrow the body,
you have to borrow the closet.
And, my dear,
you would think the woman
invented the housecoat.
So, let's see now.
Have you missed your little sister?
No.
Oh.
Don't be unkind.
You used to love playing in the dark.
Remember?
I can feel your powers waning.
Hmm. That's so sad.
They're fading.
And you know why that is.
That's what comes of pretending
to be something you're not.
Oh! Daddy's tie-pin.
That is so sweet.
The curse is gonna claim her, Macon.
You're not quite sure, though, are you?
Mm.
If you were certain, then
why bring the boy into it?
I didn't bring the boy into it.
Love brought him in.
Lena and the mortal have been
on their way to each other
Since the day they were born.
They have that terrible
thing, "destiny."
Even your Lila sensed that.
And you know the
law of the curse --
No caster may love a mortal.
Mind you, it couldn't have worked
out better if I had planned it.
That first love-- oh, such joy.
Such beauty.
And that first heartbreak.
So bitter.
So painful.
It's enough to turn any girl dark...
mortal or caster.
I'm so excited.
Lena's birthday is gonna fall
On the most powerful
solstice in 5,000 years!
More energy is gonna be
released than ever before,
and this earth's cycle will be over.
She's gonna be more powerful
than either of us, Macon,
and she will lead us all.
Toward what?
An age without hiding.
I'm --
I'm so...
Tired of hiding!
These parasites have had
their own way long enough,
don't you think?
Oh! Here's a good game.
Name one species that'll miss them.
See? You can't!
Because mortals do nothing
but consume and destroy.
They invent ideas...
Like god and love and righteousness...
And then they use those same ideas
to kill anyone who disagrees with them.
You really want to hang
out with those people?
They pray without true beliefs
and then wonder why
their spells don't work.
They don't even value
their pathetic little lives
till seconds before
it's taken from them.
Poor things.
It's our turn, Macon.
Darlin', come back.
Come back.
Lena will put an end to them.
No.
Lena will not turn dark.
She's too strong.
She has got no choice in
the matter, my darlin'.
The curse has already begun.
No. That is a lie!
What's a lie, Mr. Ravenwood?
My apologies.
Lena will return to school.
And that is an end of it.
Keep it moving.
Wow! You and Lena Duchannes.
Yeah. Don't tell anybody.
Aw, come on, and miss the
chance to see Emily shit nails?
I bet Lena could actually do that.
What?
Which one of you lucky
boys is Ethan Wate?
Well?
Which one of you has
the power of tongue?
M-me am.
I'm...me Ethan.
Ethan!
Do I know you?
Not a bit.
I'm Ridley Duchannes. Follow me.
You're a relative of Lena's?
Honey, you are looking at the relative.
Uh, oh-- this
is my friend Link.
Sincere pleasure, Link.
H-- oh, ep--
I-- wa-- hush...
Get in.
Oh, I-I wasn't invited.
I don't think her
uncle would, uh, like --
Trust me, family's dying to meet you.
Ravenwood.
Been a long time.
Lena and I are more like
sisters than cousins.
I'm surprised she hasn't mentioned me.
But then, I'm sure I
couldn't count high enough
all the things Lena hasn't mentioned.
Oh. Why, thank you, kind sir.
I look okay?
Always get a little
nervous seeing the family.
You have lovely eyes.
Mm.
You're lucky those lips are spoken for.
May I?
Mm. Such a gentleman, too.
Night, mother.
Ridley!
...i told you to stay away.
Why, I couldn't miss a
holiday with my family,
now, could I, mama?
Well, well.
Ridley, my dear.
What an unpleasant surprise.
Uncle Macon.
How old and weak you look.
I distinctly remember
forgetting to invite you.
And I told you never to
cross this threshold again!
What?
What have you done to him?
Invited him to dinner
with the folks is all.
Well...
Why don't you escort
your underdressed friend
into the dining room?
I
wasn't --
- Del.
- Wha --
Hello, cuz.
Don't you look pretty.
Ethan?
Aw. Ain't that sweet?
He's all choked up.
- Must be love.
- Oh!
Macon... It's all right, Lena.
She can do no real harm here.
You sure about that, Macon?
Don't you sass your uncle, now!
Del, why don't you
get two place settings
for our uninvited guests?
Thank you.
You sit near me, sugar.
Sit right over here.
Sis?
Larkin!
Ethan, this is my
younger brother Larkin.
I didn't think I'd be seeing you here.
And who is the stiff?
Larkin, meet Ethan Wate.
Well, well.
And this is our dear sweet gramma...
who we all just love to death.
We weren't expecting you, child.
Let me have a look at you.
Why is it, Ridley, that
when I look into your eyes,
all I can see are hers?
You two are as thick
as thieves, aren't you?
Mother!
How about a little music,
and why don't we all just
sit down and enjoy ourselves?
And let's have some wine.
Something to drink?
Here. Allow me.
Mama's homemade macaroons.
Oh!
I've missed these.
So, cuz, any big plans
for your birthday?
Nothing to concern yourself with.
You won't be invited, "cuz."
Well, Lena, darlin', you should.
Be concerned, that is.
Such an important birthday.
That's enough, Ridley.
I had hoped that we'd
have a holiday meal
that we would all survive.
What do you want?
Just to be with my family again, cuz.
You've been claimed by the dark.
You're no longer part of this family.
Ridley, sweetheart, there's
nothing we can do for you now.
I'm so sorry.
No hard feelings, mama.
But Lena and I are the same.
I wonder, when she goes dark...
...will you shut her out too?
That's enough.
You think you can keep
Lena so good, so innocent?
Wasn't I the same before I was claimed?
As I recall,
you were a spoiled brat from
the moment you were born.
Maybe I was just unloved.
I did the best I could.
And look at what I am now.
Oh, that's right. Blame the mother.
You think Lena is a good
girl now, but it won't matter.
Even if her true nature
doesn't claim her for the dark,
the curse will.
It's already started.
- I'm warning you.
- What curse?
Pay no mind to her lies.
You know it's true.
Aw, look at my manners.
Here, honey.
Let me serve you.
Get away from him!
Oh, really, cuz?
Lena, will you stop this?!
Stop it!
Aw, just another good
girl gone bad, I guess.
Lena, child, there's no need for this.
Will you stop this immediately?!
Breaking windows on poor,
helpless little mortals!
She's already closer
to the dark than I was!
You know that's a lie!
I want you out of here!
Ridley, don't make me
get up from this table!
I am so sick of everyone treating you
like you're something special!
There's nothing special about you!
Go on, you tell her, Macon!
You know how she will be claimed!
I said get away from
my boyfriend, you witch.
Oh, lord.
Boyfriend, huh?
Is he gonna be all right?
He'll be fine.
What curse was Ridley talking about?
Ridley was just telling
stories to get your rage going,
to lose control.
You mustn't let her.
Larkin, help me take him to my room.
Oh, he will.
Sitting there eating
through a caster combat,
like you're two
sandwiches shy of a picnic.
Better be a sandwich when I get back.
I'm still hungry.
Do you see the way she looks at the boy?
There's no getting in between them now.
Then it has begun.
Hey there.
How do you feel?
Like I was in a tornado
inside a dining room.
No big deal.
I'm so sorry about Ridley.
I didn't know she was back.
Yeah.
She's sort of a bitch, isn't she?
She's a siren.
She can make mortals see, think,
or do whatever she wants...
especially men.
Isn't that, like, the
working definition of a bitch?
Mm-hmm.
She wasn't always like that.
We were like sisters.
You know?
Traveled together so much
we shared the same suitcase.
Did homework, watched Disney.
We were just kids.
The night Ridley
turned 16, she ran away.
She said she could feel
herself turning dark.
She said she had to get away
before she hurt anybody she loved...
Before she hurt me.
I followed her.
Then it happened.
I saw it all.
She loved me.
I know it.
It's not fair what happened to her.
And the same thing could happen to me.
It won't.
Did you see me tonight?
I can't control myself.
Lena, I don't believe
that we have one fate and no choice.
We make our own lives.
Two, please. Thank you.
- This is Lena.
- Lena.
- Hi, Lena.
- Hi.
Here. I got to give you the money.
Thanks.
There you go.
You good? Your kids are good?
Oh, yeah.
Good.
You got the tickets?
Hi.
Get a load of this.
You know, maybe you have
Ethan fooled, but not me.
Oh, shucks.
Ah, chill, girl.
Chill, chill.
See the look on her?
I see right through her.
Hi. Just, uh, just one, please.
Alrighty.
There you go.
Do not let them bother you, okay?
Before we set out,
help yourselves to some scrambled eggs
and French toast right here...
You by yourself?
Yeah. I've been up since 5:00.
Feeling pretty good, though.
Mm.
You want milk duds?
What do you put them in your pocket for?
I have to hide some for myself,
because Link never shares.
All right. Yeah. I've been doing better.
...all by myself.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize I had that.
No, it's okay.
I wanna see.
Be right there.
Yeah, whatever you can find!
There's gold in there and silver!
Get it all!
Hurry up before it's all gone!
Ethan!
Ethan!
Don't you dare...
Okay. Don't you dare go anywhere.
Don't you dare, Ethan carter Wate!
Come back. Wait, Ethan.
Body of my body, marrow and mind,
soul of my soul, to our spirit bind,
blood of my heart, my tide, my moon,
blood of my heart,
my salvation, my doom!
Genevieve.
Was I shot?
What happened to your eyes?
Form up, company!
Oh, my darling Lena,
do you see now how you must be claimed?
We are the descendants of Genevieve.
Her dark power is in our blood!
Oh, how I've missed you, my daughter.
Your mother, Sarafine,
has come home for you.
Guess Satan hates sequels, too.
It's over.
There is no more.
It's served its purpose.
Lena?
The curse began with your
great-great-great grandmother,
Genevieve Katherine Duchannes.
She had the temerity to
fall in love with a mortal,
your ancestor, Ethan Carter Wate.
In 1864, he deserted.
Came home to his Genevieve.
But he was killed in front of her eyes,
by Union soldiers
who were ransacking greenbrier
during the battle of Honey Hill.
And in her madness, in her grief,
She used a spell that
is forbidden to us.
To bring him back to life.
A spell that left a curse?
No caster may reverse death.
So she lost her soul,
consumed by darkness forever.
But the spell worked.
If Genevieve loved
him, why'd she kill him?
In that kind of darkness,
there's not even a memory
of love, only power.
Everything has a price.
You told me my mother was dead.
You lied to me.
Why?
- Why?!
- Lena!
Our words, our language
cannot explain all that there is.
There are other ways
someone can die to us.
No, I'll tell her.
Your mother, Sarafine,
is the most powerful
dark caster of all of us.
She lives in the
darkness, in the shadows.
If she does appear, it's in
the guise of someone else.
She has no love for you.
That's what I was trying
to protect you from.
So I'm gonna be claimed
for the dark no matter what?
No, not necessarily.
I know your true nature. It's strong.
Sarafine recognizes it too.
She knows that without the curse,
your true nature would
claim you for the light.
No. I believe the curse can be broken.
But you need to have
a will that's so strong
you control your own nature.
That's what I told her.
The first thing you have to do
is to get rid of him. Wait. What?
Sarafine's using you. That's not true!
Listen to me, Lena.
No, listen to me, Lena.
Ethan, Macon's right!
If you're to break this curse,
you have to control your emotions.
And loving this boy puts
you in terrible danger!
How could you know?
You never loved anyone.
You despise mortals.
You never even had a
friend, even in our world.
How could you know?
I know that no good can
come from us loving a mortal.
Lena, listen to me.
There's got to be a way,
another way to break the curse.
Macon!
Don't even think that, young man!
You'll get the both of you killed.
You have to get out of her life.
Do you hear me?
Lena... Say your goodbyes.
Macon's keeping Lena at Ravenwood.
He won't let me see her.
He thinks keeping us apart
is the best thing for her.
But he's wrong.
I know Lena.
I know her like I know myself.
And I can feel her slipping away
into some place where I can't reach her.
Go away! Go away!
Go away! Go away!
Hi, dear.
Hello, Mrs. Lincoln.
Hi, dear.
Hi. Just a minute.
Oh, dear.
This door seems to be stuck.
It's just these old houses.
They're such a nuisance.
Yes, ma'am.
They warp.
Link's not here.
Oh, I know. I know.
He's at savannah snow's party,
which is where all the kids are.
I had to make quite a
number of phone calls
to get him an invitation
on account of his...
Well, on account of
his friendship with you.
Um, I'm sorry you had to
go to that trouble, ma'am.
Well, you should be
at that party, Ethan,
kicking up your heels
with your real friends,
with the children who
belong in this town.
I'm not much up for a
party tonight, ma'am.
Oh, well, that's a shame.
Well, see, I-I made you some brownies.
I thought maybe I could
come in and we could talk.
My fight's not with you, son.
It's not. Never has been.
It's just that girl with
her seductive quirkiness,
and you being motherless and all.
May I come in?
No, ma'am.
I-I-I don't
think so.
Did I hear you...
Correctly just then, Ethan?
Do I have to ask you again?
May I come in?
No, ma'am, you may not.
But I have made you brownies!
I-I've made you brownies from scratch!
Oh, well, slap my ass and call me sally!
Lena bound your house.
Oh, that's so sweet.
As if.
I'm on your side, son.
What's a little curse
when it comes to true love?
Anyone can see
you and Lena are just
meant for each other,
till death do you part!
Lena?
Get out of this house.
L-Lena.
Keep her bound.
Lena.
Lena, can we please just go outside
for one second and talk?
I need --
get out!
No!
Please, son, for your own good.
You should really listen to them.
No!
I'm sick of listening to your family.
I have been chased, spun, hypnotized,
paralyzed, and damn near
killed by your family.
I've been going out of my
mind for the last two weeks.
And now your mother
shows up on my doorstep
and damn near gives me a heart attack!
But you know what?
I don't care about
them, about the curse.
You are not going dark
and you are not losing me.
No matter what you do, no
matter what they do to me,
I'm still here.
Now, what does that tell you?
How could the boy break our spell?
He has no power.
It's not we who protect
her now. It's the boy.
Amma, we need your help.
Why come to me?
The way you talked about the locket,
about the curse.
Excuse me, miss Amma,
but I think you know
more than you're saying.
Please, Amma.
This isn't the place you're
gonna find anything you need.
Meet me in the back.
This must run under the whole town.
The whole country.
Gatlin is like the
capital of caster America.
It used to be under Washington, D.C.,
until Nancy Reagan made them move.
She was the only mortal
they were ever scared of.
They know a caster's here.
Amma, why didn't you tell us about this?
A keeper has to be asked.
A keeper, as in you're a...
The caster library has
been the responsibility
Of seers like me for generations.
Something I had no choice
about either, by the way.
And these books hold the
histories of the casters
from around the world,
the laws that keep balance
between light and dark.
Hey! Get away from that!
Macon comes here every day
and reads every book he
can for the forbidden spell.
He found nothing?
Mnh-mnh.
But you can do it.
God gives us what we can handle,
even if we don't believe it ourselves.
Close your eyes.
See with your mind
what you're looking for
as if you've already found it.
I knew it.
"book of moons."
It's the most powerful
book of the otherworld.
It's as alive as you or me.
Strongest of every spells, good and bad.
- Did Macon look through it?
- No. He couldn't.
The book chooses who reads it.
Its law is "like attracts like."
There...
There's no writing.
Oh, it won't reveal itself so easy.
A curse this dark takes
its time showing itself.
The dark will test you.
Don't worry. You'll find it.
Just look under "how not
to turn into your mother."
Come on.
Come on.
I've been taking Lena
to the caster library
for weeks now.
But Lena's getting discouraged.
The longer this thing takes,
the more I see a change in her.
We'll-- we'll
find a way, okay?
You're just a mortal.
How would you know?
Hey, I can make wind.
Maybe not a
hurricane, but I --
Why don't we just admit it?
A-admit what?
It's already started.
I'm turning into a dark bitch.
- I can feel it.
-  No, no, no.
Lena, you're just
stressed. It's not --
It doesn't matter what causes it.
I'm turning, and you're
just too stupid to see it.
Okay, now you're a bitch.
Really? Is this necessary?
I'm agreeing with you!
Okay.
I'm just a dumbass mortal who
can't make his own thunder.
But I know there's no way
we're gonna figure this out
Unless you stop feeling
so damn sorry for yourself
all the time!
Go ahead!
Start an earthquake.
See where it gets you.
Everybody has to deal with
shit in their lives, Lena.
What are you yelling at me for?!
You want to be a normal human?
What do you think that is?
We don't have powers to just
change things whenever we like.
Being human is feeling bad!
It's feeling pissed off!
It's feeling scared
and not being able to
do anything about it
until you don't feel that way anymore,
until you can just
see your way out of it.
And I yelled at you
because I care about you.
That's what normal people
do who love each other
when one of them is acting like a brat!
Now, would you please
stop raining on me?
♪ Ooh, ooh
♪ Ooh, ooh
I'm sorry.
♪ Ooh, ooh you've
got to get away from me.
I don't know what I do.
It just happens.
You still don't get it, do you?
I don't want to be any
further away from you
than I am right now, one way or another.
I'm scared I'm gonna hurt you.
Well, love's a risk for anybody.
I mean "kill you" hurt you.
Go ahead.
Kill me.
♪ Ooh, ooh
♪ Ooh, ooh
♪ Ooh, ooh
♪ Ooh
What part of "you cannot touch it
if you are not a caster"
don't you understand?
There were casters in the Civil War?
Casters have been fighting
alongside mortals for centuries,
every war, every side.
Just 'cause they're supernatural
don't make them any smarter.
You know, what I can't figure...
Is you go to church every Sunday?
Mm-hmm.
How do you believe in all
this and still believe in god?
God created all things, didn't he?
It's only men that go and
decide which ones are mistakes.
My mom came here, didn't she?
With Macon?
They met here many times.
Macon loved teaching
her about his world.
Macon loved her, didn't he?
No one knows what Macon
can and can't feel, but...
Lila sure got close.
Ethan?
She loved your father.
You going somewhere?
Wherever Lena is.
Even if that's in Gatlin.
What are you doing here?
I don't know what power you
have over Lena, but, uh...
I've come to ask you to... Let her go.
I don't have any power, Macon.
I just love her.
Then just put an end to it.
I can't.
Even if it means destroying
the Lena you love?
Hm?
It can't, because there's no way
that what Lena and I feel for each other
Is gonna turn into
something wrong or evil.
There's no way.
As long as I live, I'll never
understand you creatures.
You have no real power.
You live at the mercy of
forces outside your control...
And yet you believe that what you feel
will somehow make it all right.
Gotta have some faith, Macon.
Lena?
You okay?
Lena?
Lena?
Yeah?
I-is something wrong?
No! I-I think I found something.
Yeah? What? Let, l-let me see.
Well, it's a lot to read
and a lot to take in, and
I really got to concentrate.
Okay.
So I was wondering...
Well, I've gotta do
it on my own, kind of.
You know, and if you're here,
you're just gonna distract me.
And I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind going home now.
And then, when I'm done,
I'll call you later.
Is that okay?
Sure.
Whatever you want, okay?
Thanks.
I love you.
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Lena?
He's gone.
It's okay.
Shh.
Talk to me.
Lena.
There's only one way to break the curse.
Genevieve used the forbidden spell...
to give life to the one she loved.
To break the curse,
the one that I love...
has to die.
Oh, god.
What are you gonna do?
I won't hurt Ethan.
Never.
They're only our words, Amma.
They can't explain everything.
There are all kinds of ways
someone you love can die.
- That's all the book said?
- Yeah.
All it said was to reverse the curse,
I need to do these certain rituals,
caster stuff, every night and every day
right up until the claiming.
And whatever happens, happens.
Hey, we know what's gonna happen.
I want you to do something for me.
Between now and my birthday,
I don't want to think
about the claiming.
See? No tattoo.
I just want to be with you
- and do normal boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.
- Great.
Well, how about tonight is,
uh, the Christmas dance and...
You could be my
date. It's p--
Is Ethan Wate asking me to the dance?
Oh, my god!
I'm thinking about it.
No, they've got piss punch
and the chaperones guarding
the make-out stairs.
It is god-awful.
Sounds perfect.
I still don't know what to get you.
Huh?
I mean, we-- we don't
celebrate Christmas.
What do you wish for every
year that you never get?
Oh, well, no.
No, it's not-- you're
gonna think I'm so not cool.
That's okay. I don't
think you're cool now.
Snow.
Really?
Yeah?
Well, you know
what? I just --
I always wanted one of those...
W-white movie Christmases.
I mean, look at this.
This is, like, pathetic.
This ain't Christmas.
You know that set-up's too easy.
Yeah, I know.
That's what you really want?

Ethan!
Did you come home late
from the dance last night?
Um...
Can you get this turkey
out of the refrigerator?
Yeah.
I don't, uh, I don't remember.
I must have been pretty tired.
But I slept real good for
the first time in a long time.
Oh, that's good. Lena
coming over for Christmas?
We got enough food.
Lena?
Lena Duchannes.
Lena Duchannes?
Why would I invite Lena
Duchannes over for dinner?
I barely know her.
She doesn't speak to anybody at school.
Do you know her?
Emily's mom says she was
in a mental institution.
I don't know whether I
trust what Emily's mom says,
but she's kind of a weird girl.
Hey, except for that damn
Civil War thing and meals,
I'm staying in my bed
the entire winter break.
I don't want to preach today.
Instead, I just want to talk to you.
About a word we don't
hear much anymore --
Sacrifice.
It's not what I'd call a modern word.
People hear the word "sacrifice"
and they become afraid
that something will be
taken away from them.
Or they'll have to give up something
they can't live without.
"sacrifice," to them, means "loss,"
In a world telling
us we can have it all.
But I believe true sacrifice...
is a victory.
Because it requires our free will,
to give up something
or someone you love,
for something or someone
you love more than yourself.
I won't lie
to you --
It's a gamble.
Sacrifice won't take
away the pain of loss.
But it wins the battle
against bitterness.
The bitterness that dims the light
on all that is of true
value in our lives.
What do we do now, Auntie Sarafine?
She gave him up.
She loves that boy. The
curse will still work.
But we'll need his friend.
Oh, my sugar darlin'?
He's ready to go whenever I call.
Can I do it again?
You can't tell anyone.
Promise me you won't tell a living soul?
I won't, I swear it.
Ahh. Okay, one last time.
Try it again.
That is so cool.
I'll let you know when to do it, sugar.
You'll hear me loud and clear.
Just like you always do.
You have no idea
how much I just love
you to death right now.
Ready? Fire!
Fire!
Awesome.
Come in.
Are you ready to get dressed?
It's real pretty.
You've done the right thing.
How will I know if it worked?
When the curse has been
paid, you'll feel it.
You'll know.
Oh, people are starting
to arrive, sweetheart.
It's time.
Mavis, you look very s-special.
Well it is a very special day!
- Mom?
- Hi, sugar.
Careful with that.
Just 'cause there's no bullet
doesn't mean it can't burn you.
You're both late. Take a rifle and load.
You two are going to greenbrier.
Um, hello, everyone. And, uh...
Oh, thank you for coming.
Um...
The moon will be out soon,
so we should, uh, we should start.
Um...
Excuse me.
As the ancients have foretold...
a natural will be claimed.
For it has been predetermined
by the five elements
that upon this night...
An old cycle shall end and
a new cycle shall begin,
wherein the powers of
light and dark will merge,
and that upon this child
who becomes a woman...
Lena Duchannes...
Her true nature
will reveal the true
nature of all power...
for the new cycle.

Hey, halt!
Or shoot me.
I'm so goddamn itchy, I swear,
I'd just rather be a casualty.
This is so stupid.
I wish I was...
You want-- you want
to just kill each other?
Come over, watch a movie?
"aliens"? Blu-ray?
All right.
On the count of three.
Ready.
- One.
- One.
- Two.
- Two.
Three.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Ethan?
Ethan?!
Ethan.
- Lena.
- No.
Cease fire!
Ethan!
Where is Ethan?
Greenbrier! Get the
hell outta here, girl!
Ethan!
No! Ethan, no, no!
No!
Lena-- Lena, I didn't
k-- Lena, I swear.
No, don't! Don't!
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
You can't trust them, cuz.
They'll turn on each
other for no reason at all.
Lena, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Okay?
Welcome to the family,
my darling, special girl.
Storm's coming, Mr. Lee. Should we stop?
Lena, stop!
Macon?
Stop this, please.
Macon. Macon, what have you done?
The curse...
had to be paid.
I don't understand.
Somebody you love has to die.
That was a sneaky trick, Macon.
No fair.
Macon?
I promised his mother.
I can't lose you!
It's all right. It's all right, Lena.
No.
Don't let them fool you.
Claim...
yourself.
Uh-oh.
What are you doing?
I think this is just
between you and me, mama.
Fine with me.
Ridley! Don't be afraid.
She's on our side.
She's our Lena. You listen to me.
You're my daughter. I
always wanted you with me.
They took you from me.
The moon appears, and it will claim you
as you are destined to be claimed!
Accept it, sweetheart.
There's nothing you can do!
No one can do that.
Let me go! She's more powerful than you.
Lena! Lena, listen to me.
It was her idea.
Okay, she told me you
were going dark anyway.
I would never hurt you.
You remember when I left,
so I wouldn't hurt you?
Lena?
Go.
Thanks, cuz.
You know, you're a lot more
like me than you care to admit.
Well, nobody's perfect.
Lena, you have great powers.
I can teach you how to use them.
I can teach you how to become
the most powerful dark
caster who ever lived.
Oh, that's so sweet of you, mama.
Oh, baby.
This mortal you think you
love? You can never be together.
I know. Did you ever love me, mama?
You know, I don't remember.
No mother does, really.
It's not easy, you know,
pushing another female out of your body,
a younger, more perfect
version of yourself,
with every option and no mistakes.
Anyhow, love is just a
trick of the mind, you know?
It doesn't really exist.
There's no such thing in nature.
Love's a spell, created by
mortals to give their females
something to play with instead of power.
I want you to have power.
I want you to be who you truly are.
As long as I'm just like you.
There's darkness in you.
Don't you try and deny it.
I don't.
Well, then claim it.
Claim it and come with me, be with me.
We can rule over a new world,
our world.
What are you doing?
It is a new world, mama.
But it ain't all dark,
and it ain't all light.
And it ain't all ours.
I remember now.
I remember now. I did
love you. I do love you.
I did love you. I love
you, darlin'. I love you!
You really shouldn't use
words you don't understand.
You still need me!
You've done enough, mama.
You must be claimed!
Macon?
You all right, cuz?
Yeah.
Macon said this was the
only way to protect you both.
I could hear the sound.
The sound was me breaking.
I cried because he had lived.
Because he had died.
I was shattered, I was saved.
I only knew the girl I was, was gone.
He was right.
No good can come from loving a mortal.
They can't survive our world.
Get out. Go, Ethan.
Claim yourself in defiance, in hope...
in love, in fury, in gratitude.
Claim the light. Claim the dark.
Claim it all.
Nothing can stay.
- You all set?
- Yeah.
We should be in New York by
Thursday if we make good time.
We're gonna go stay with
Link's cousin in Brooklyn.
Come here.
I'll call you as soon as I get in.
You call whenever you can.
Bye.
Hi. Um...
Lena, right?
- Hi. Yeah.
- Ethan Wate.
Yeah, I know.
Um, so, I wanted,
I-- you know...
Um, I'm sorry that we never got to hang,
but I always wanted to tell you
I thought your-- your, uh, poems
In creative writing...
Just really good.
Thanks.
That's really nice of you to say.
You're leaving?
Yeah. Uh, college road trip.
I'm going to check out NYU.
Great. It's good.
Oh, cool title.
Bukowski?
He any good?
Define "good."
Keep it.
A "gettin' outta Gatlin" present.
Really?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Cool. Thank you.
- All right.
- See you.
See you.
Ethan's coming. All right. Bye. Hey.
Is it all right if we go
see my mom at the sanatorium?
It's on the way.
Sure.
