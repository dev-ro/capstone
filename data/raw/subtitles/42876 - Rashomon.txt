I don"t understand... 
 I just don"t understand.
Idon'tunderstanditatall.
I just don"t understand.
What"s wrong?
What don"tyou understand?
I"ve never heard 
 such a strange story.
Why don"tyou tell me about it?
We happen to have 
 a wise priest in our midst.
No, not even the renowned, 
 wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple
has heard a story 
 as strange as this.
Soyou know something 
 about this strange story?
This man and I havejust seen it 
 and heard it ourselves.
- Where? 
 - In the courthouse garden.
The courthouse?
A man was murdered.
Just one? So what?
On top ofthis gate, you"ll fi nd 
 at least five or six unclaimed bodies.
You"re right.
War, earthquake, winds,
fi re, famine, the plague...
Year afteryear, 
 it"s been nothing but disasters.
And bandits descend upon us 
 every night.
I"ve seen so many men 
 getting killed like insects,
but even I have never heard 
 a story as horrible as this.
Yes. So horrible.
This time, I may fi nally lose 
 my faith in the human soul.
It"s worse than bandits, 
 the plague,
famine, fi re, orwar.
Look here, priest.
Enough with the sermon.
It sounded interesting, 
 at least while I kept out ofthe rain.
But ifit"s a sermon, 
 I"d sooner listen to the rain.
Hear me out. Maybeyou can 
 tell me what it means.
I don"t understand 
 any ofthose three.
- Which three? 
 - Well...
I"ll tell you about them.
Calm down and tell me slowly.
The rain"s not going to stop 
 any time soon.
RASHOMON
It was three days ago.
I went into the mountains 
 to get wood.
Iranas fastas Icould 
 to tell thepolice.
Then, three days later-- today-- 
 I was calledto testify.
Yes. That"s right.
I was the one 
 who fi rst found the body.
What? Did I see a sword 
 or something?
No, nothing at all.
Just a woman"s hat 
 caught on a branch,
and the cap ofa samurai 
 that had been trampled on.
There was a cut-up piece ofrope 
 near the body,
and further along in the leaves, 
 a shiny amulet case with red lining.
Yes.
That was all I found, yes.
Yes.
I met the murdered man 
 before his death.
It was three days ago, 
 in the afternoon.
On the road from Sekiyama 
 to Yamashina.
The womanhada veil, 
 so Icouldn'tseeherface.
Theman was armedwith asword, 
 as wellas abowandarrows.
Little did I expect 
 that he would meet such a fate.
A human life is truly as frail 
 and feeting as the morning dew.
What a shame 
 that his should end this way.
I"m sorry.
This man I caught is Tajomaru.
Yes, the notorious bandit 
 everyone speaks of.
The last time I almost caught him, 
 he looked the same
and he carried that same sword.
It was two days ago at dusk, 
 by the banks ofthe Katsura...
What"s wrong?
There were 17arrows 
 with eagle feathers,
aleatherbow, andahorse.
All these belonged 
 to the dead man, yes.
The irony ofTajomaru being 
 thrown off his stolen horse,
this had to be fateful retribution.
I fell off the horse? 
 You fool!
On that day...
I was riding that horse 
 and I was suddenlyvery thirsty.
So around Osaka, 
 I drank from a spring.
There must have been 
 a dead poisonous snake upstream.
After a while, I got 
 an incredible stomachache.
By the time I came to the river, 
 I couldn"t hold it any longer.
So I got off the horse 
 and crouched in the field.
I fell off?
Obviously, a fool can think only 
 foolish thoughts.
I know sooner or later 
 you"ll have my neck,
so I"m not going to hide anything.
It was this Tajomaru 
 who killed that man.
I saw that couple three days ago. 
 It was a hot afternoon.
Suddenly a cool breeze 
 rustled the leaves.
Ifit hadn"t been for that wind, 
 I wouldn"t have killed him.
I caught a glimpse 
 and then she was gone.
Maybe that"s why.
I thought I saw a goddess.
At that moment I decided to capture her, 
 even ifI had to kill her man.
But ifI could have her 
 without killing, all the better.
My intention then was to take her 
 without killing the man.
But I couldn"t do it 
 on that road to Yamashina.
What doyou want?
What doyou want?
What is it?
Don"t be suspicious.
See? Isn"t this nice?
Take a good look at it.
There are some ruins over there.
When I dug up the mound, I found 
 a heap ofswords and mirrors.
I buried them in a grove behind the mountain 
 so no one else would fi nd them.
Ifyou"re interested, 
 I"ll sell them toyou cheap.
It"s over there.
Walk ahead ofme.
It"s here. Beyond those pines.
Your husband 
 has taken sick.
Her face turned pale. 
 She stared at me with frozen eyes,
her expression intense like a child"s.
When I saw that, I envied the man 
 and I suddenly hated him.
I wanted to show her how pathetic 
 he looked tied to that pine tree.
These thoughts that weren"t there 
 before fi lled my head.
Ihadneverseen 
 such fierceness in a woman.
And so I had succeeded in having her 
 without killing her husband.
I still had no intention 
 ofkilling him.
But then...
Wait!
Stop!
Eitheryou die or my husband dies.
One ofyou must die.
To have my shame known to two men 
 is worse than dying.
I will go with the survivor.
So I had to kill him, 
 but I wanted to do it honorably.
He fought verywell. 
 We crossed swords 23 times.
I remember this 
 because I"m still impressed.
No one had ever crossed swords 
 with me more than 20 times.
What? The woman?
I don"t know.
When the man died, 
 I turned to her. She was gone.
The fighting must have scared her 
 and she ran away.
I ran out to the mountain road.
All I found was her horse 
 grazing calmly.
I was attracted to her fierce spirit,
but, after all, she wasjust 
 like otherwomen.
I didn"t even look for her.
What? His sword?
I exchanged it in town for liquor.
What? Her dagger?
It had pearl inlay. 
 Looked veryvaluable.
I totally forgot about it. 
 That was foolish.
The biggest mistake I ever made!
Even amongst the bandits, 
 Tajomaru is famous for being a womanizer.
Why, last fall, a young wife went 
 to the temple and she and her maid
were found dead in the mountains. 
 That must have been him too.
Who knows what really happened 
 to that woman who left her horse?
Well, that woman showed up 
 at the courthouse.
She was hiding in the temple 
 when the police found her.
It"s a lie.
It"s all a lie. 
 Tajomaru"s story and the woman"s.
It"s human to lie.
Most ofthe time we can"t even 
 be honest with ourselves.
That may be.
But it"s because men are weak 
 that they lie, even to themselves.
Not another sermon.
I don"t care ifit"s a lie, 
 as long as it"s entertaining.
What story did the woman 
 come up with?
Well, it"s completely different 
 from Tajomaru"s story.
So different that her face didn"t even 
 show the fierceness he spoke of.
She was so docile, 
 she was almost pitiful.
That man in the blue kimono,
after forcing me toyield to him,
proudly announced that 
 he was the infamous Tajomaru,
and laughed mockingly at my husband 
 who was tied up.
How horrified my husband 
 must have been.
The more he struggled,
the tighter the ropes dug in.
I ran to his side. Or rather, I tried to.
Even now, when I think ofhis eyes,
my blood turns cold in myveins.
What I saw in them was neither anger,
nor sorrow,
but a cold light, a look ofloathing.
Don"t.
Don"t look at me like that.
It"s too cruel.
Beat me,
kill me, but don"t look at me like that. 
 Please, stop.
Now kill me.
Kill me at once.
Stop.
Don"t.
Please don"t.
I must have fainted after that.
When I came to 
 and looked around...
Imagine my shock.
I saw my dagger 
 in my dead husband"s chest.
I was in shock
and I don"t remember 
 how I left the woods.
But when I came to,
I was standing by the pond,
at the foot ofthe hill.
I threw myselfinto the pond.
I tried many different things.
But I failed to kill myself.
What should a poor, 
 helpless woman like me do?
I see. The more I hear, 
 the more confused I get.
But women use their tears 
 to fool everyone.
They even fool themselves.
Soyou have to beware 
 ofthe woman"s story.
When you hear 
 the dead man"s story--
He"s dead. 
 How can he tell his story?
He spoke through a medium.
Lies. His storywas also lies.
But dead men don"t lie.
Why is that?
I refuse to believe 
 that man would be so sinful.
Suityourself.
But is there anyone who"s 
 really good?
Maybe goodness isjust make-believe.
What a frightening--
Manjust wants to forget 
 the bad stuff
and believe in the made-up 
 good stuff.
It"s easier that way. 
 - Ridiculous.
Nevermind.
Let"s hear the dead man"s story.
I am in darkness now.
I am suffering in the dark.
Cursed be those who cast me 
 into this dark hell.
After the bandit attacked mywife, 
 he tried to console her.
Shesaton theleaves, 
 staring down atherknees.
Thebandit was cunning.
Nowthather virtue was stained,
she couldnolongerbe 
 with herhusband.
Leave thehusband 
 andwhynotmarryhim instead?
He saidhe onlyattackedher 
 outofhis love forher.
Whensheheard that, 
 my wife raisedherfaceas ifin a trance.
She had never looked so beautiful.
Andwhat was mybeautiful wife's 
 response to thebandit
in frontofherhelpless husband?
Wherever.
Take me whereveryou want.
That"s what she said.
But that wasn"t her only sin
or I wouldn"t be suffering 
 in the dark like this.
Please kill him.
While he"s alive, 
 I cannot go with you.
Kill him!
Those words were like a wind that
threatened to blow me 
 into the depths ofdarkness.
Has such a hateful thing 
 ever been uttered by a human before?
Even the bandit turned pale 
 at those words.
Please kill him.
What doyou want me 
 to do with her?
Kill her or save her? 
 You only have to nod.
Forthese words alone, 
 I was ready topardonhis crime.
Kill her or let her go?
Idon'tknow 
 howmanyhourspassed.
She got away. Now I"ll have 
 to worry about my own fate.
Everything was silent.
Iheardsomeone crying.
Someoneis crying.
Whois that?
Everything was silent.
How quiet it was.
Suddenly the sun went away.
I was enveloped in deep silence.
I lay there in the stillness.
Then someone quietly approached me.
That someone gentlywithdrew 
 the dagger from my heart.
It"s not true!
There was no dagger. 
 He was killed by a sword.
Now it"s getting interesting.
It seems you saw the whole thing.
So why didn"tyou tell the court?
I didn"t want to get involved.
You can talk about it here, right?
Tell me, then.
Your story seems to be 
 the most interesting.
I don"t want to hear it. 
 No more horror stories.
They are common stories 
 these days.
I even heard that the demon living 
 here in Rashomon
fed in fear ofthe ferocity ofman.
Come on. 
 How much doyou know?
I found the woman"s hat 
 in the mountains.
You already said that.
About 20 yards further, 
 I heard a woman crying.
From behind a bush, 
 I saw a man tied up,
a woman crying and Tajomaru.
Soyou lied when you said 
 you found the body.
I didn"t want to get involved.
All right, then.
Go on. 
 What was Tajomaru doing?
He was down on his knees, 
 begging the woman for forgiveness.
until now, whenever I wanted 
 to do something bad, I did it.
That way I suffered less.
But today, it"s different.
I already had you, but I only 
 wantyou more. It"s very hard.
I beg you to be mywife.
The notorious bandit Tajomaru 
 is begging you on his hands and knees.
Ifyou wish, I"ll even stop 
 being a bandit.
I have enough stashed away 
 to giveyou a lavish life.
And ifyou don"t want my dirty money, 
 I"ll even work.
I"ll stoop to selling odds and ends 
 on the street to supportyou.
I"ll do anything 
 ifyou come with me.
Marry me, please.
Ifyou say no, 
 I have no choice but to kill you.
Please, sayyes.
Stop crying and answer me.
Tell meyou"ll be mywife!
Say it!
It"s impossible.
How could I, a woman, 
 say anything?
I get it. You mean 
 it"s up to us men to decide.
Hold it!
I refuse to risk my life 
 for such a woman.
You"ve been with two men. 
 Why don"tyou kill yourself?
Hopeless.
I don"t want this shameless whore. 
 You can have her.
At this stage, I"d rather lose her 
 instead ofthe horse.
- Wait! 
 - Don"t follow me!
Stop crying. 
 It"s not going to work anymore.
Stop it. Don"t bully her.
Women are weak by nature.
It"s you who are weak.
Ifyou are my husband,
why don"tyou kill this man?
Then you can tell me to kill myself. 
 That"s a real man.
You"re not a real man either.
When I heard you were Tajomaru, 
 I stopped crying.
I was sick ofthis tiresome daily farce.
I thought, ""Tajomaru might 
 get me out ofthis.""
""Ifhe"d only save me, 
 I"d do anything for him.""
I thought to myself.
Butyou werejust as petty 
 as my husband.
Just remember: A woman loves a man 
 who loves passionately.
A man has to make a woman his 
 by his sword.
I don"t want to die!
So that"s the real story.
I don"t tell lies. 
 I saw it with my own eyes.
I doubt it.
It"s true. I don"t lie.
No one lies after he says 
 he"s going to do so.
It"s horrifying.
Ifmen don"t trust each other, 
 this earth might as well be hell.
That"s right. This world is hell.
No, I believe in men.
I don"t want this place to be hell.
Shouting doesn"t help.
Think about it. Out ofthese three, 
 whose story is believable?
No idea.
In the end, you cannot understand 
 the things men do.
What areyou doing?
What"s it toyou?
- That"s terrible! 
 - Terrible?
Someone else would have taken 
 the kimono. Why shouldn"t I?
- It"s evil. 
 - Evil?
What about this kid"s parents?
They had their fun and then they 
 throw out the kid? They"re evil.
No, you"re wrong.
Look at the amulet on the kimono. 
 It was left to protect the baby.
Think about what theywent through 
 to abandon this baby.
I don"t have time to mind 
 everyone"s feelings.
- You selfish... 
 - What"s wrong with that?
Dogs are better off in this world.
Ifyou"re not selfish, 
 you can"t survive.
Damn it.
Everyone is selfish and dishonest.
Making excuses.
The bandit, the woman, 
 the man and you!
And you aren"t? That"s funny.
You may have fooled the court, 
 but not me.
So what did you do 
 with the dagger?
The valuable one 
 with the pearl inlay
that Tajomaru was talking about?
What happened to it? 
 Did it disappear in the grass?
Ifyou didn"t, who stole it?
It seems I"m right.
A bandit calling another a bandit. 
 Now that"s selfish.
Doyou have anything else to say?
Ifnot, I"ll be going.
What areyou doing? 
 Taking what little it has left?
I have six kids ofmy own.
Another one 
 wouldn"t make a difference.
I am ashamed ofwhat I said.
It"s inevitable to be suspicious ofothers 
 on a day like this.
I"m the one 
 who should be ashamed.
I don"t understand my own soul.
No, I"m grateful toyou.
Thanks toyou,
I think I can keep 
 my faith in man.
Don"t mention it.
THE END
