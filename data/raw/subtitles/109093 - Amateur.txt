You can bag me to stop.

It is good for the business.
I know...
How was your date?
I think there is something wrong with me.
How long has it been since you left convent, Isabel?
10 months
- And how long were you nun?
15 years
- A lot of time...
But I made mistakes
sometimes a big ones...
Were you always religious?
- No.
When I was a girl...
I wasted a lot of time writing bad poetry...
... about being lonely and too fat.
You were fat?
- not so fat but I was ugly.
Well, anyway...
it was about that time that
the Virgin Mary appeared to me
Pardon?
It is true... I speak to me three times in one year.
and what did she say?
She said that I should not become a nun.
Why?
- Because I am nymphomaniac.
What?
- It is true.
You don't look like one.
- Look like one? Nymphomaniac?
yes.
- how do you know?
But I lied.
I told to the priest that god
wanted me to joint the order.
and become nun.
- After all that, I was scared.
of what?
I was scared of what I knew
God's plan for me.
God has a plan for you?
- Yes.
Which?
- I don't know yet
the virgin didn't tell it to me
but she said that it is going to
to be difficult and its going to happen
and that I need to be here in the the world,
not in the convent
I was 17 ... I was scared so I lied...
I lied for 15 years, I lied
until I couldn't bear it any longer...
Shit.
will you make love to me?
when?
when you finish a bath
why me?
- why not you?
not don't know me ...
you don't know my name.
you don't know your name, either.
Have you ever had sex?
- No.
How can you be an nymphomaniac
if you have never had sex?
I am choosy.
I need to shave.
Is this ok? I use it on my legs.
I don't think  you are nymphomaniac.
- You don't? No.
So, you'll make love to me?
I did the same thing yesterday... here
I think I am in to much pain, to make love tonight.
I can wait
I've waited all my life.
Edward?
Its Sofia.
Yes... I am in New York
I cannot talk now.
can I see you?
no
Thomas is dead
yes...
Sorry.
You talked in your sleep.
I do?
- yes.
What did I say?
Have some coffee.
What did I say?
You were shouting at someone
named Sofia.
Sofia...
Do you remember her?
No...
How do you feel?
Better.
- Good.
we should go to the police.
- No.
why?
- Maybe somebody is looking for me.
this Sofia person, maybe?
Yes
Maybe
You were very mean to her...
and now you miss her.
Yeah?
Yes.
Very mean.
- How?
you threatened her to hurt her
what did I say?
Isabelle, what did I say in my sleep?
you said that you will slice her
face with razorblades.
I hate you
he took advantage of me
he got me hooked on
drugs when I was 12...
he put me in pornographic films...
I am sick of it....
I want to change my life
he won't let me...
I am unhappy...
I've pushed him out of window.
I killed him
When was it?
- yesterday morning. Here, in New York?
How did he know you were in New York?
- I don't know. He knew everything.
Really.
What did he want?
- He was angry because I've left him
He said that If I didn't come back he will
disfigure me
he showed me some pictures
stuff they do to girls.
what you gonna do?
I don't know.
Tell me about Jacques.
Jacques?
- Yes.
How do you know about Jacques?
- Thomas mentioned him.
Oh yeah, What did he say?
- Not much.
But I know that Thomas got the money
from him to make the movies.
He is a businessman.
What did you do for him?
Look, I didn't do anything for him,
I am the accountant of their money.
Is that what he does legal?
Look, the less you know about Jacques, the better.
Forget all that Thomas said about him.
I think that Thomas was
in trouble with Jacques.
Thomas was in trouble with everyone.
Why?
- Because he is a devil.
no... I mean why he was in
trouble with Jacques.
Thomas tried to blackmail him.
With what?
Accounting documents,
records of banking transactions,etc.
So, Jacques did something illegal.
He is an arms dealer.
And that is not allowed?
it depends... not always...
in this case, definitely not.
What did the documents look like?
why... you know where they are?
- I don't know.
They are on floppy disks.
floppy disks?
- yes... you know...
like these things.
This is what you call a floppy disk?
Yes.
But if is square...
- Yes, but they call them floppy discs...
It's not floppy either... It's stiff
Look, Sofia. Did you ever see Thomas with
something like this?
No.
Hello... yes... what?
No way... right.
I'll be right back.
Sorry, about that.
- So what do you do now that you back in the US?
I prepare people's taxes
- Oh... that sounds so interesting.
Look.
This is the address of
a house one of my clients owns
upstate, in a town called Porchester.
No one is there.
You go by train this afternoon,
take the taxi from the station...
Pick up some groceries, that will
last for couple of days...
Here is 50 bucks.
And when you get there, stay put.
We'll see what happens.
How do I get in?
I get the key from my office and
I'll meet you in the station.
Thank you Edward... I know you
must not think that much of me.
No, you are wrong.
Anyone who killed Thomas is a friend
of mine.
He has ruined our lives
- No, he hasn't.
He damaged them, but
I am going to change all that.
I am going to change my life...
and I'll help you, too.
I'm going to take charge of things.
I'm going to be a mover and the shaker.
You wait and see.
That's all we can do for the time being.
No one has reported a person you fitting,
is missing.
but if they do, at
least we have your picture.
Do you have a place to stay?
yes. Thank you.
- Oh good...
I hate to bring people in your position
across the street, in the hospital...
it is so cold, so unfeeling,
so hopeless...
And frankly,
under staffed.
Lets go... you can stop crying...
- OK... OK...
You are officer of the law.
take care... good luck...
thank you...

These are for you.

if anybody asks about
those floppy disks or mentions Mr. Jacques
you just act as if you had never heard of any of these
- Sure...
I mean, not even to your
closest friends.
your you my closest friend.
thank you.
- Besides, I am good in keeping secrets.
that is good.
I learned all sorts of criminal
behavior from Thomas
O, yeah? Like what?
I rather not talk about it.
It was pretty disgusting.
how did you meet Thomas, anyway?
Threw my sister...
She used to travel around with these
rock'n'roll bands, I left home and joined her.
You were a groupie?
- Yes, and then my sister had an overdose
and the band threw me out
from the bus in the middle of the nowhere...
I then I met Thomas, and he
got me into a movie thing.
You were 12 years old then?
- Almost 13
He were a good pornographer for
a while. At least I thought so.
there were offices, in London
Amsterdam, Miami...
We made products of certain good quality
we paid bills on time.
We made profit, we were rich, actually.
- Why did you quit?
I had no choice. I was trying
to save my life.
I don't understand...
It is true... Jacques would kill anyone
who even knows about those floppy disks.
Excuse me?
I tried to tell him this. I tried to tell
him that he is risking
my life as well as his own.
Risking your life.
Risking the lives of everybody who
worked with us.
but he didn't care.
He didn't care about anybody.
but they didn't kill you.
they didn't kill me because
they don't know where I am.
We should go now.
I'll walk you to the train
- no, I am ok.
Go house.
- I don't want to go home.
I am enjoying myself.
- You got to go home, Edward.
you should be hiding.
No, they still think I am in Europe.
come with me, than.
Why?
- come with me, to the country.
now?
- Yes, now, come on, we have to hurry.
Aren't you having a good time?
Yes, we are having great time.
I feel so close to you, all of the sudden.
Please, come with me.
Sure...
- Good, lets go.
There are few things I have to take
care in the office before I go.
I'll call you to the house as soon
as I can.
where to, pal?
Drive!
- where to?
Just drive.
- Right.
Even in these smallest things
she saw pointlessness of hope
the impossibility of forgiveness
"how is it possible? ", she asked
that in the universe sustaining such
consciousness brutality,
a friend can laugh,
a mother smile,
a father sacrifice,
or a lover kiss.
Is that it?
- Yes.
What do you think?
Well...
Frankly, Isabel...
it is quite bad.
It is?
- I am afraid so.
But what is wrong with it?
It is not pornographic.
- Yes, it is.
The first part is.
it is poetry...don't you try deny it.
I am sorry.
I have failed you.
A mistake is not necessarily a failure, Isabelle.
- No?
Hmh, look at me.
I am a fairly successful editor
of dirty magazines.
I've never intended this.
My aspiration was
defamatory journalism.
My big ambition in life was
to get my hands on smutty
pictures of presidents' mistresses.
I wanted to undermine huge
corporations,
so that seeds
of revolt
by publishing details of
high level government corruption..
But
you know
things happen
We drift away from our vocation.
Now, look.
Here is a 100 bucks.
If you think of something really dirty,
really perverse, I mean really disgusting
and gross.
give me a call.
is it worth?
Ok?
- Ok.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you reading?
The Odyssey
Is it interesting?
Sort of.
What is it about?
Well, it is about this guy Odyssey, mostly.
He is the king of a place called Ithaca.
He is an OK guy.
but he has to go and fight in the war.
He is gone for ten years.
And when he is on his way back, he is lost
and he now wonders around for another 10 years
Well...
and he has really beautiful wife,
Penelope, back home,
all the other men
in Ithaca want to marry her
Can I see it?
Penelope doesn't want to marry any of them,
because she is waiting Odyssey to get back.
But for what she knows, he could be death.
Sounds great.
What are you reading?
Chicks.
Do you find these women attractive?
I prefer girls of my own age.
That's understandable.
Do all women have hair like
this between their legs?
yes... I guess, most
but there is a woman on page 22
that doesn't.
Can I keep this?
it belongs to friend of mine.
I got to give it back.
Look... the new Sofia Luddens movie.

How much you pay for that?
- I lease it.
Really?
- Yeah. It is cheaper.
Bring me that lamp.

I have not seen him in over a year.

No, I don't.
I don't know where she is.
Sofia Luddens.
What do you want from her?
She doesn't know anything...
Jan look, we go way back...

I was younger than.
I didn't know any better.
I moved up.
I am more realistic now.
What if I told you
that Sofia killed Thomas.
That you are lying.
but, it is true...
Is it?
That's great.
That's why we are here
to find out.
but, first
I got to know where this girl, Sofia, is?
I won't tell you anything.
You realize that we are
going to torture you?
I won't tell you anything about Sofia.

From Thomas.

- He had them with him yesterday.
Is he here, in New York?
- He is dead.
Tell me the truth.
- That is the true.
I pushed him out of that window.
That makes sense, Jan.
Edward said the same thing.
- It would have been in the paper, we would heard.

about Thomas.
but what can I tell you... that he is dead!
- why was he here, in New York?
This is where he lives?

Who has Thomas been in
contact with?
I don't know.
- How long has he been in the States?

There are things that I can do with pair of...
You need me for anything?

Good, I'll check on these disks.

Sometimes they don't

Do you understand me?
Can you hear what I've been saying?
God, I can't take this job...
You got to put yourself up...
- What, I have to become completely insensitive?
Just do your job.
Is this a friend of yours?
Did this man harmed you in some way?
Can I ask you a personal question?
leave me alone...
You resent your position
in the motion picture industry?
Sorry, I find you very
attractive and am interested in commodities.
What are you talking about?
A commodity is an article of trade.
A product in its pure sense.
What that got to do with me?
your you the product.
I'm?
- You are commodity.
Thomas tended your body
in exchange for money.
So, I am an article of trade?
- yes.
A useful thing in terms
of modern capitalism.
I studied economics. I know what
I'm talking about.
Tell me why Thomas was in New York
and who did he come to see?
He came to see me.
- Why would he come to see you?
He wanted me back.
- Wanted you back?
I run away.
- From Thomas?
He'd loved me.
- and you've left him?
Yes.
- why have you left him?
He scared me.
- but you've just told me that he loved you?
I just want to change my life...
What about Thomas?
- He took advantage of me.
Who's fault is that?
- I killed him...
I swear...
I don't believe you.
- please don't hurt me
Why would you be scared
of a man who loved you?
It's OK.
Fuck!
Let me drive.
- why?
because you don't know
how... I know how, I just don't remember
But it's a same thing
What is the matter with her, anyway?
- She is afraid of you.
Great, what do we do now?
Let me drive.
- NOT!
Be careful!
you north.
- what?
Porchester
you are wearing my stuff...
Sorry.
They are good on you.
- thanks.
Are you in love with him?
I have just met him.
Is it truth that he can't remember
his name?
He has amnesia.
I hate him anyway.
what did she say?
She is in trouble with those men.
She doesn't want to go to the police.
Does she know who I am?
yes!
but she won't tell me.
She said that you were very dangerous man.
I'll be outside.
You mind if I sit down?
Look I can't remember anything.
I can't imagine what I
have done to you, but...
I want you to know that if there is
anything I can do to help you, I will.
this woman... Isabel
who is she?
- She helped me out.
She doesn't know who you are?
- NO!
neither do I.
but I do.
Will you tell me?
NO... I won't...
Do you have the key?
- No.
There is only one bad upstairs.
You get some sleep, I stay up.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!
Are you sure you don't want to go to the police?
they'll only send me back to Holland and
Mr. Jacques would kill me when I get there.
who is Mr. Jacques?
it doesn't matter
I know a place not far from here
where you can hide for a while.
you'll be safe.
- I wish that they had just killed me.
don't talk like that...
I am not afraid of dying.
I am afraid of pain.
No one is going to hurt you.
yesterday I thought I was so smart.
Like I will help people and to
stop bad things from happening.
I was going to change things.
Change my life.
I got a man killed.
DON'T do that!
it is not loaded...
I know, I emptied it.
But who cares?
You gave me unloaded gun to
protect ourselves?
I was scared.
You don't trust me at all, now. Do you?
I am sorry...
Did you think that I'll walk in there, and
shoot two of you in sleep?
She told me you done things like that before.
What else did she say?
She said you were in trouble, too.
In trouble with who?
- those men... back there
And who are they?
They work for a highly respectable yet
ultimately sinister
international corporation
with political connections.
Are you making this up?
- no... it is true...
And what do they want of me?
- They want to kill you.
Why?
- Because you know what is on these...
and what the fuck are these?
- floppy disks...
What?
- Discs.
but they are squared,
and they are not floppy, either...
they are stiff...
What is it?
This is it. What ever I am supposed to
do, this is it.
Isabelle, I don't think this is
a divine intervention.
no?
- no.
It not a miracle,
and it's not God's will.
You know what I think this is?
I think this is just really bad luck.
and its got nothing to do with you,
so you shouldn't not get involve
more than you already are.
I know I was meant to find
this girl,
and to help her.
You do, hah?
- Yes.
I think, maybe,
I am supposed to save her of you.
I am the same man you knew yesterday.
maybe...
We have no information on this man,
he has no record.
We have checked everything...
- This guy is a maniac, from I can tell.
Sir... he is troubled.
Did he say anything, yet?
- no... nothing...
Get him out of here Melvin...
He is a mental case.
I am sorry.
I have to book you.
Hello?
Don't worry.
Everything gonna be all right.
Yes... This is Isabelle.
No, I am sorry... I know it is early.
but I have something interesting...
What?... No, this guy is...
but very damaging
documentation of high
level government corruption.
I don't know what government, exactly...
maybe s few...
Look,...
I am on a run from a group of
blood thirsty assassins,
and I am hiding in the country,
Ok.
I'll call you when I can.
Expect an envelope tomorrow. Bye.
Where is Isabel?
I don't know.
the car is gone...
Look, I'm won't hurt you...relax
It rang before, too.
Did you answer it?
Well, yeah...
- why?
I thought it may be Isabel
- you are idiot.
They probably know where we are, now.
How was I supposed to know?
How were you supposed to know?
You used to knew everything.
Oh, yeah. Why don't you tell me
what I used to know?
Why don't you answer the phone?
- Fuck you.
Drop dead.
- Listen you! I had enough of this shit.
Are you going to tell me who I am and
what is going on around here or what?
You want to know who you are?
yes!
why should I tell you who you are?
- because I am asking you to.
and I am supposed to do whatever you
want me to do, is that it?
Forget it, I don't care, I don't want to know.
Now you see, it's just like you...
- What is?
Answer the telephone!
You answer the damned phone.
hello
Sofia. It is Jan.
I've got Isabelle and I know where you are.
I am going to make a deal.
You tell me if Thomas is with you.
Just answer yes, and you and Isabelle
will not be harmed.
but if you say no - Isabel is dead...
yes or no... Is he with you? If he is... I'll knock
on the door in five minutes, let him answer.
Yes or not?
Yes... and you and Isabelle are free
No... Isabelle is dead
Sofia...
Yes or no?
yes...
Are you OK?
Edward.
you are alive...
let me drive
- No, no...
It is Melville's gun, sir.
- We got to trace a car.
It's been spotted. There is an
officer in pursue.
Where? - About five miles away.
It headed east, toward the river.
Anything in that direction?
- Yes, sir... a convent
Isabelle?
This is bad.
Who is he?
- He is my friend.
Tell him to wait outside.
Isabel, are you in trouble?
Yes...
I knew that you got into trouble, I knew it.
you should have never left here.
never...
Let me tell you...
Let me tell you who he is...
How is she?
- the bullet smashed the shoulder bone,
we can stop the bleeding
but you got to take her to the hospital.
Now, what is his problem?
you go... Girl wants to talk to you.
I told her...
I told ... Isabelle... everything
I told her who you are
I cannot forgive you
I can only forget,
and I don't want to.
I am sorry.
What are you sorry for?
Do you know?
no...
I don't.
I don't know what I am sorry for.
but I am sorry.
That got to mean something, right?
I mean...
whatever is she's told you
whatever I was...
this is I me now.
What else can I do?
Will you still make love to me?
Eventually.
I'll go pull out the car.
wait!
Here.
Take the gun.
I've put the bullets back in.
Thomas!
This is not him.
hmh, miss...
excuse me, miss...
Do you know this man?
Yes,
I know this man.
