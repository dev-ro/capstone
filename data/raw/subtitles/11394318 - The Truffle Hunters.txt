These are for your president.
How many truffles does he need?
500 grams.
What you told me yesterday.
I chose the truffles for your president.
They are incredibly rare this season.
Really good and strong.
I'm smelling them now.
But I can't send you the aroma by phone.
They are great... the smell is fantastic.
They are beautiful and round.
Now the soil is poor...
...but in the first weeks,
there were a lot of good truffles.
Yes, at the beginning of the season
I also found a lot of truffles.
Every week I collected 100-150 grams.
They were good.
-150 grams!
- Really, they were good.
In August it was forbidden to hunt...
...but I went hunting once a week,
and every time I found 200 grams.
- Of course you did.
- Nobody was hunting.
For two or three weeks
we found good truffles...
...then they diminished...
...and finally they stopped growing.
From September to November,
the soil has been really poor.
Half of the woods are like that.
In the Puset area
I found only two truffles.
I found only two or three in that area.
In Tasso Valley you can find some more,
but there are too many people hunting.
What did you find, Fiona?
- It's a very busy area.
- Yes.
Are we going to sleep?
We're going to sleep.
Good dog, good dog.
Hmm?
You're all clean!
You're 84 years old.
You have no wife, no children.
You're the best truffle hunter.
Can you tell me your secret spots?
Or can I go truffle hunting with you?
Never! Never!
We can go truffle hunting...
...but in your places
or in a place that neither of us knows.
We can go to a new place.
For example, that forest over there.
Where no one knows
if there are truffles or not.
Maybe there are,
but I don't want to go where you go...
...nor where I go.
But if tomorrow something happens to you...
...your knowledge would be lost.
It would be a disaster.
Then I'll tell you what to do.
Worry about yourself and your family.
Don't worry about me.
Remember, the best thing—
the best thing is to find a place
that you couldn't even imagine.
You have to go with a dog...
...a good dog or a bad dog—
better with a good dog.
If you don't trust your dog,
you shouldn't go truffle hunting.
It's like when you study...
...if a bad teacher makes you pass the exam...
...you get your degree,
but it's worth nothing!
I agree, but... let's be practical.
If you pass away,
what about your places?
They'll remain hidden for years,
maybe forever.
Maybe it's better to find an agreement.
Continuing traditions is really important
for us and for you as well.
If you had a child, you would teach him.
No, I wouldn't!
Come here!
Birba, come to daddy.
We're almost done here.
You're a good girl, Birba.
Birba.
Birbetta. You're my Birba.
My little Birba. Yes you are.
Shh.
Birba, come!
Look!
There's only some broth left for dad.
No, no, no!
Wait a moment!
Here.
Turn around.
Eat.
Good girl.
- So you don't hunt truffles anymore.
- No.
Why?
Do you know why I don't go anymore?
Because people are greedy.
They know nothing about the forest,
but they want to plunder it.
- Am I right?
- Of course.
But this is your territory,
you should have a say.
You're right.
But there's no respect, they kill dogs.
- Or they puncture tires.
- Yes, I know.
We put up a fence,
but they destroyed it.
- And they enter your property.
- They do whatever they want.
Now I only go hunting for truffles
on my own land.
- That's a good idea.
- Yes.
But you have truffles here,
and people come from all over.
Yes, you're right.
They enter my property
without even asking for permissión.
They should just open my fridge
and take my truffles.
You don't even need to go into the woods.
- You know who they are.
- Yes.
They're so greedy. It's unbelievable.
Why can't we go truffle hunting again
and bring some breakfast?
- No.
- We can go in the early morning.
I'll have breakfast with you,
but I will not go truffle hunting.
But why not?
What was the name of your dog?
- Siana.
- She was amazing!
Do you remember that time
that I dug up to here—
- And when she sat, do you remember?
- You arrived to give me some light.
- At a certain point, you screamed: "Stop!"
- "Stop, it's huge!"
- There was a root in the middle of it.
- Yes.
- So you cut the root out of it.
- Yes.
- And when she smelled the truffle she sat.
- She sat.
- She was unique.
- Yes she was.
She deserves a monument.
Last night, while I was in the woods...
...I had a flashlight with me...
...but I didn't see well.
I hit a tree with thorns on it.
- Did you hit your face falling down?
- No, I was walking and a branch hit me.
I had the dog with me and I told her:
"Titina, show me the way."
Her name is Titina.
She did,
but I was following her and hit a branch.
- Did you have glasses on?
- I never wore glasses.
- So you were lucky.
- Yes, I was.
Can I take your hat off?
Let's leave it here.
My hair is a little bit white.
So you did not hit
any other part of your body.
Shoulders, legs?
- When I slip, I get right back up.
- Yes, of course.
You didn't faint?
You remember what happened?
I remember.
Please look at me and follow my finger.
Follow my finger.
Do not move your head,
and keep following my finger.
Look here. Look here... Very well.
Now look this way.
Very well. Look up... look down.
Very well.
Let's go back towards the other side.
Follow my finger,
but don't move your head.
Now the other side. Very good.
Now relax, Carlo.
Do you feel
your arms and legs are still strong?
Yes, I do. I walk faster than the deer.
Grab my fingers and press.
Hold on tight. Very well.
This is not clean yet.
Oh, I love fresh tomatoes so much.
I've heard something
in the village.
Is it true that your wife won't
let you go truffle hunting anymore?
True, she doesn't want me
to go at night anymore...
...she thinks I'll get hurt.
So now I go less at night.
- You keep going during the day?
- Yes.
When my dog Titina sees me going outside...
...she's excited to go truffle hunting.
So you'll bring me
some truffles this year?
Oh, geez... I hope so.
- A few truffles.
- Truffles are so good, aren't they?
They're good with eggs
and on anchovies and garlic.
Even with spaghetti or ravioli.
If you're not picky,
you can eat them with anything.
Sure.
This is a beautiful moment.
We are here together
with our friend Carlo and his dog.
- What's her name?
- Titina.
We invoke God's blessing.
May God preserve Carlo still
for a long time...
...with full health and energy.
So that he can...
...continue his work
as an outstanding truffle hunter...
...serving people,
so they can eat his truffles.
And may God preserve...
...the dog's sense of smell,
which is precious and helps with the hunt.
Therefore we ask for God's blessing...
...on Carlo and his dog.
So, Gianfranco...
...you know how it works.
You've been coming into my territory
and buying from my hunters.
- You're right, but you did the same.
- No.
Well, you did it
with some of my truffle hunters.
No, I've never done that.
If not you,
your brother or someone else did.
I know it for sure, Franco.
You know it too.
Truffle hunters
and clients are two different things.
You're right, but you know
the rules of the truffle system...
...everyone has his own territory.
And people should respect this.
Franco, I've always respected you,
also in loving memory of my father.
And you know it,
since you were my dad's friend—
one of the few ones
who have always behaved well.
But if a client calls
and asks me to show him some truffles—
I didn't know that you were his supplier.
I can't know who comes to sell here,
you understand?
More or less we can have an idea
about truffle hunters.
Have I ever come to San Damiano d'Asti,
to purchase truffles?
- Have you ever seen me?
- No.
- That's it.
- But—
I've never bought
from your truffle hunters.
But if a restaurant or a client calls me...
...I don't know if you
or someone else is supplying them.
You know well the ones
who go around trying to sell everywhere.
I've never done that,
I've always stayed in my place.
So you can't tell me where to go
and where not to go...
...'cause there's a free market where we've
been selling truffles for 32 years.
- Everybody knows us.
- You're right. You're right.
But the good old rules,
which were quite respected in the past...
...are getting abandoned now.
It shouldn't happen.
You know I've always believed
in respecting people.
I'll give you big ones,
one kilo in total.
Now I have a 280-gram...
...a 180-gram and a 140-gram.
I still have to buy 400-500 grams,
but I'll try for more tonight.
- What time will you bring them?
- At 12:00.
Cleaned and ready.
For the price I have to see
how much I spend today.
- Every day the price changes.
- Treat me well.
Every year I buy from you,
but you always punish me!
It's better to be punished
by a friend than an enemy.
I'll treat you well,
but it'll be around 4,000-4,500 euros.
Depends on how much I pay tonight.
We need to be careful.
Here we don't use muzzles on our dogs,
so it's easy for them to eat poison.
That happened last year with Vasco,
the same story.
- If my dog dies, I would die too.
- My goodness.
Leo, come here!
We would do anything for our dogs.
It's happening again, my God.
Even if we're the only ones hunting
in this area, we need to pay attention.
Someone wants to poison our dogs.
Because we find the most truffles.
- You know!
- I go wherever the truffles are.
Envy is a bad thing.
We need to be careful.
Leo, come here!
We should keep quiet
about the truffles we're finding.
Between you and me, we can share.
Thank you for giving me that truffle
last night, I really needed it.
- I'm glad to help.
- Anyway, everything changed overnight.
This morning there were almost
three times more truffles.
They're growing fast now.
Show me what you've got.
Come on!
Come on. You're so lucky.
- Here's one.
- Gosh! Did Fiona find it?
- Fiona and Pepe found it.
- Good job, congrats.
I only found one truffle.
This is sample B.
Wet ground.
What does it smell like?
- Wet ground.
- Wet ground... and then?
Then mushroom.
- Did you like it?
- Yes.
Then try this one.
And you can try this one.
- It's more subtle.
- Okay, more subtle.
I would say... spices.
- Intense. Mm-hm.
- What do you think of this truffle?
Do you like it more or less
than the other?
- I like it.
- You like it.
- And you?
- I like that one more.
We are starting to have clearer opinions.
Now I'll change the game.
Let's try with this.
Give that to me.
Not like this. They're not aligned.
You should try to align them.
- As much as you can.
- Okay, I see.
They have to face this way.
And they should be in front of this.
- In front of the plate?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Otherwise people won't see them.
And also closer,
so that they frame the truffle.
Birba! Yes, Birba.
Wait, Birba! Look here.
Take a look over there.
Let's go. Come on, Birba.
Look here.
Have you found something?
Here, Birba. Drink.
Good girl.
You've had enough water?
Let's go.
Let's go, Birba. We're leaving.
I need to find someone,
who will love you and stay with you.
Do you understand? And it's not easy...
...because you're good at truffle hunting,
you're really obedient...
...and people may take advantage of it,
you know, Birba?
You want me to pet you?
You want dad to pet you? Yes?
Don't worry, dad will find someone—
You know what I was thinking?
I know you want me to pet you.
You know what I was thinking?
You know what I'll do?
If we find a wild woman...
Because, you know...
...there are some good ones,
but they're rare.
I will leave her the house...
...and she will take care of you.
Charlie is old, but...
I'm afraid that Charlie
and I will both go, beyond the veil.
You know where that is?
You don't know, darling.
And Biscaro... he's a wild dog.
But I'll leave her the house,
and she will take care of you, Birba.
As long as you live.
â™ª And priests tell us to do penance â™ª
â™ª And while they're having fun
We're left empty-handed â™ª
â™ª But then we fool them
And we get all the fun â™ª
â™ª In the end they are empty-handed
While we get all the fun â™ª
Keep playing... don't stop!
â™ª Battista who's a... â™ª
Wait. â™ª Battista... â™ª
â™ª Battista has a loving wife â™ª
â™ª She spent too much money
And then he scolded her â™ª
â™ª But she's so sick of it
And so one morning â™ª
â™ª She proved to him
That she wasn't spending enough â™ª
â™ª Write a list, you grump!
Forty liras to buy some coal â™ª
â™ª Coffee, sugar, bread and milk
300 liras is how much I spend â™ª
â™ª But this is not enough
We also have to eat dinner â™ª
â™ª And 1,000 liras cannot be enough â™ª
I want to write down
why I want to quit truffle hunting.
Right, Nina?
I should finish my cigarette first,
or I can't see anything.
I want to quit...
...for one reason—
there are too many greedy people.
They don't do it for fun
or to play with their dogs...
...or to spend some time in nature.
They only want money.
I want to write that down to explain
the situation to a few friends.
If they want to listen.
But who knows!
People use poisons...
...to kill dogs.
If I catch one of those,
I'm going to hang them on a tree...
...upside down.
Because dogs are innocent.
The cigarette went out.
Carlo!
Carlo!
It's almost night.
Come home.
Carlo!
Carlo!
Where are you?
Do you listen to me or not?
You do not listen to me!
- I do not know what to say.
- You don't?
You don't want to listen to me.
So do as you like.
Put that hen in the henhouse!
Come on. Go to sleep.
Go to bed!
- These are good.
- Yes, they are. But they're small.
There are very few truffles this year.
You're lucky
if you find two truffles per week.
- Yes, this is a tough year.
- Yes, it is.
- It's a dry year.
- I know.
This one is beautiful.
- This one not that much.
- I know, but it's dry.
- This one was ruined by the dog.
- It's just a scratch.
- Yes, she scratched it with her nail.
- That happens.
Yes, but they've got a strong scent.
Fiona, come here. Good girl.
Don't worry, the truffles are here.
- So...
- How much would you pay for them?
- You know their worth.
- I know, but more or less.
Make me a good offer and they're yours.
But I promised them to someone else.
- How about I give you 450?
- What?
- How much do they weigh?
- There are 350 grams.
These truffles have suffered
from the high temperatures.
There is nothing we can do about it.
This year the truffles have been strange.
- They develop during summer.
- They do.
You can tell by the soil,
it's imprinted on them.
You are right.
However, the color is nice.
- And the aroma is intense.
- What about the price?
Prices are low now,
but we'll try to find an agreement.
- How much do they weigh?
- A bit more than 350 grams.
- So, let's say 350 grams.
- Well, a bit more than 350.
Well, 350 grams...
There are many small pieces and some big...
...but they are pretty nice, Egidio,
especially the aroma.
You know that in the end,
you sell the aroma of truffles.
A truffle without aroma
would be worth nothing.
The scent is all that matters.
Let's say 500 euros
for the whole bundle. Is that okay?
- Holy Mary!
- Were you expecting more?
I wish I could pay more.
I'll pay you 150 euros per 100 grams.
You just make up these prices.
I have no way of knowing
what a fair price is.
I've always treated you well
and kept a special eye on you.
I used to sell my truffles at the market,
but now everything has changed.
We would display them on a little table...
...now I can't go to the market,
so I have to accept your prices.
I have no way of knowing the market rate.
Look, business is slow this week.
Here, take these 500 euros.
It's not Christmas yet, so people
aren't buying. It's a slow period.
I can give you 550 euros,
because you always treat me well.
- Wait, let me count.
- Yes, double-check.
Two, four, five hundred and fifty.
- Okay?
- Yes.
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª
Eat. Happy birthday, little Birba!
One for me and one for you.
We're sharing the meat.
Or would you like it all for yourself?
I'm hungry too!
Mmm!
Eat it, come on.
They're not that big,
but the quality is great.
They are great...
...because it's been cold.
They smell amazing.
Uh...
They're round and really different...
...compared to ten days ago.
And for the regularly sized pieces,
the ones you buy every week...
...today, the price is 4,500 euros per kilo.
Let's do something, for fuck's sake!
Now even the typewriter won't work
when I'm pissed off.
We need to teach the youth,
we need to go back to 50 years ago.
When to undress a woman...
...you had to take ten...
dresses and four petticoats off.
They wore very thick black stockings...
...but when you arrived at the thighs...
...you found butter.
Things like this piss me off.
Now I'll rest and drink some wine.
Thanking God you've been able
to do this until the age of 88.
Because eventually,
we are all going to die.
Oh, yes. There's a limit for all of us.
And what do you think you'll do,
after that?
I hope that God will be on our side
in the afterlife...
...as we have been told in this life.
I'm sure that you'll keep
on hunting truffles.
- In the afterlife too?
- Of course!
Because this is your passión,
with which you also help the people.
You'll continue to do that.
If you have been
a good truffle hunter in your life...
...you'll continue to be
the truffle hunter par excellence.
Have you found any truffles
during the night?
Yes, last night I found some.
- May I take them?
- Of course.
- They are nice.
- Yes, quite nice, very nice.
- I was lucky.
- Sometimes you need some luck.
- Do you see them, Titina?
- Well done, Titina!
- Yes, they are quite nice.
- Yes, quite nice.
- They are a little bit flat—
- Not every time you are lucky.
Sometimes even the ground does not help.
Let's have a look.
Keep breathing. Good.
Very good.
There's ten grams of earth here.
This one is the same from last week,
we have to throw it away.
- That one is really good.
- We have to throw it away.
- But it's good.
- I don't care.
I told you it was dirty and had this hole,
why did you bring it again?
- I can clean it.
- No.
- No, that one is good!
- I don't care.
- I'll clean it and bring it later.
- You can't bring me this stuff.
I'll clean it just as you want.
- Bring it again once it's clean.
- Okay.
- These two have to be cleaned.
- Okay.
- You know better than me that—
- I sold half of it.
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven... Seven.
- Bring them back cleaned.
- Yeah, I'll be back in ten minutes.
380.
- Be careful.
- How many?
- How many were there? Twelve?
- Seven.
Seven.
Go.
Birba!
Birba!
Come here, come!
Daddy has to go!
We have to go home, Birba!
Come here!
Birbetta!
Birba, go and take the pear
over there, go!
Good! Come here, jump here.
Come here. Wait, wait.
We've got some work done.
Jump here, come here!
Look what a nice color it is.
This is a special pear, you know?
They call them Martin.
You see, do you know what the vet says?
I tell you, Birba.
Wait, wait! Jump here, come!
Do you know what he says?
One pear a day will keep the vet away—
who wants to give you medicines
or treatment.
I'll cure you, you know?
Me, myself, I'll cure you.
You see, I'm getting old.
You're still young.
Maybe I've found a family
or I'll look for one...
...that has other dogs.
Because one fine day,
you have to understand—
Wait, I'm gonna clean you.
One fine day, I'll leave for a long trip—
maybe to America.
And what if I don't come back?
Who's gonna take care of you?
Maybe it's too small.
Does it hurt her nose?
Yes.
- Let's try another one.
- I see, it's a different shape.
This muzzle is even better.
So the dog can't eat poisoned baits
with this.
No, nothing.
Are there poisoned baits where you hunt?
Yes, sometimes.
Can dogs breathe
with muzzles in summertime?
If you use this one, no problem...
...but if you add this piece,
he can't breathe well.
Why do you put that piece
under the muzzle?
Because some dog baits are full
of strychnine.
I see, it's enough to just touch
the strychnine with the dog's mouth.
With this muzzle...
...the dog can't even lick.
In our area,
we haven't found strychnine yet.
This muzzle is much easier.
She'll soon get used to it.
Start with this one
and if you see poisoned baits...
- ...then we can attach this piece.
- Got it.
When I was an acrobat,
in Castelnuovo Calcea...
...how many marriage proposals
do you think I got?
50.
- Nice pictures.
- Apart from that... 50 marriage proposals.
The priest came to me and told me:
"You should consider it.
They are rich, they own farms..."
Look at this picture.
Look. I enchanted them.
You enchanted them
pretending to be a holy man.
In their eyes, you were a good boy.
They have been bewitched.
I walked on stilts, that's fascinating.
- You should have taken that opportunity.
- Oh, no! I ran away.
I would have taken the opportunity.
They were rich.
The priests tried to convince me, but—
- But they didn't manage to convince you.
- No, they didn't.
- Those are my poems.
- Uh-huh.
I wrote them.
- Who typed them?
- I did.
- Really?
- Yes, I typed them.
Did you write them
when you lived in Mombercelli?
Yes, mostly.
My typewriter is broken.
I have to get it fixed.
- Is it an Olivetti? The 33 model?
- The smallest one.
Carlo!
Carlo!
â™ª With a smile on her face
The lovely wife said to Battista: â™ª
â™ª If you stay home with the kids â™ª
â™ª I'll think about earning
The daily bread â™ª
â™ª You don't have to worry
You'll just have to learn how to cook â™ª
â™ª If you turn a blind eye on this
My dear husband â™ª
â™ª I'll think of everything â™ª
â™ª Battista said:
My darling, I wanna listen to you â™ª
â™ª I'll turn both my eyes blind
And you do whatever you want â™ª
At some point that guy asked me...
...if I would like to sell Birba.
I said that I would never sell her.
He then took out the checkbook
and said he would give me a blank check.
Oh, boy. That is a very good offer.
"I will give you...
four, five, six thousand euros."
I said that it was too much.
Birba was there sitting
and looking at me and at him.
I said, "Have you got family?"
He said he had a wife and two kids.
I told him to come back tomorrow,
we could talk it through.
He was very happy,
and the following day he comes back.
He did not bring any children.
He came with his wife or partner—
whichever, I do not care.
He told me again...
...he would give me a blank check
and I could put any amount on it.
The wife did not say anything.
I asked again,
"Have you got any children?"
They said yes.
Then I said, "Let's make a contract.
Come back tomorrow.
I will go to the bank
and withdraw 50,000 euros cash.
Then, will you sell me
one of your children?"
These are very nice quality truffles.
Top quality.
What about the price?
With these ones I have to charge you
at least 4,000 euros.
At least 4,000 euros. I swear it to you.
This is a special price for you.
It should be much higher than that.
It is really impossible to put together
three pieces like these today.
They are amazing. I know it's a lot.
I know it is.
Then I saw my dog was stumbling.
He could hardly breathe.
He swallowed it straightaway?
His eyes were wide open...
...he was stumbling and foaming at the mouth.
I thought, "Oh, goodness, the poison!"
Then I took him in my arms.
I'm sorry—
- Don't worry.
- It's the second dog!
It's terrible! I brought him to the car.
I always have
some hydrogen peroxide with me.
If you give it to the dog,
it makes him vomit the poison.
Fried egg with fondue.
Thank you.
I like it. Very good.
- You must go truffle hunting again.
- No, no.
- Don't you want to anymore?
- No, no, finished. Never again!
- Why not?
- You know why.
But you have
the perfect truffle forest right here.
The best truffles were yours,
all big like this.
It was a long time ago.
They don't grow like that anymore.
- But why the hell not?
- Gosh, don't break my balls!
Do you know who you are?
All you sellers have the same last name.
"Grab and take home!"
Grab and take home.
You knew my father too.
Yes, but your father was
another kind of person.
I'm just like him.
- With your father, a handshake was enough.
- The same with me.
The truffle hunters who sold
to my dad 30 years ago still sell to me.
- I would also like to continue with you.
- No, no.
- No more with me.
- I knew I couldn't make it—
Move over, goddamn it!
Fucking Mother of God!
You're only a pain in the ass!
- Don't you want me to help you with this?
- No, I don't!
- I'll put on my work clothes.
- I don't have truffles for you, that's it!
I have clients from Russia, from America,
all asking me for truffles.
And I thought to come to you,
because you're the only one who—
Go buy from the black market!
- But I don't do that.
- The others do, don't they?
You know I don't do such things.
I will never go truffle hunting again,
that's it!
I just met a lady with a strange name.
Li... Li... I can't remember.
Lisabetta?
Letizia!
She's a little bit, you know—
But you never know, right?
So, have we agreed, Birba?
Yes? Have you digested at last? Good!
And now,
do you want to give a kiss to dad?
Wait a little, please.
I told you many times.
Why won't you stop truffle hunting?
Why are you so stubborn?
Stay at home. Especially at night.
You might fall and hurt yourself.
Then others will have to take care of us.
But if I fall, it's my pain.
Listen to me!
Others will have to take care of us.
So you need to slow down...
...with truffle hunting,
that would be better.
But I like it at night—
We would then be a burden for others.
During the night,
I like to listen to the owl.
You can listen to it from home.
You can only hear the owl in the woods.
You can hear it from home as well.
- But I love it when I find a nice truffle.
- Listen to me.
You are already 87 years old,
you should give it up.
But those years are gone already.
We need to think about the ones ahead.
Don't worry for the ones ahead...
...but think about the fact that you are
almost at the end of your life.
What if this is just the beginning?
It would be difficult for us
to start again.
Only if that's God's plan.
- We will see—
- Start listening to me.
You have your pensión.
You need to stop now.
You never listened to me.
- But I've always done...
- ...what you wanted.
Now listen to me.
Think about how many years we spent—
Listen to me!
Are you listening to me?
Now you have to stop.
You have to avoid going at night...
...and you shouldn't go
during the day either.
The truth is, at the end,
it's rare that I eat truffles.
I don't have time.
How can I manage to eat it?
I finish late every day...
therefore we never manage to eat it.
It's unreal. We sell many truffles,
but we never eat them.
It is not normal...
It does not work like this.
Everybody tells me...
..."You have so many truffles
in your refrigerator...
...you just have to get one,
clean it and eat it."
Yes, right, but when?
I do work day and night.
I can't go in there
at eleven o'clock at night—
I can't prepare pasta
at eleven o'clock at night...
...and slice truffle on top.
I am dead tired at that time.
Have you sensed
a little bit of garlic aroma?
Just a little bit, right?
- And do you like it?
- Mm-hm.
Truffles have a little bit
of garlic taste.
It's "garlic"!
"Garlic" in English.
You know what a lady told me?
She asked me, "Why don't you get married?"
Because I have Birba.
I don't need a woman!
I have Birba.
She finds truffles and then I cook fondue.
And then we eat and we are just fine.
Do you understand? You and I.
It's not that easy
to find a woman, you know?
If only I were younger.
You know, maybe once—
But now I'm old, poor me.
What can we do about it?
It's you and I, Birba.
And Charlie. That's great.
That's great, Birba.
Shh!
Titina.
