Spectators!
You are about to hear
a Latin version...
...of king Oedipus
This version is an opera-oratorio
based on Sophocles' tragedy
But it preserves only a certain
monumentaI aspect of its various scenes
I shall recall the story as we go along
Oedipus, unknown to himself,
contends with supernaturaI powers
He contends with
those sleepless deities...
...who watch us from a world
beyond death
At the moment of his birth
a snare was laid for him
And you will see the snare
closing on Oedipus
Now our drama begins!
Thebes is prostrate.
After the Sphinx, a plague breaks out
The chorus implores Oedipus
to save his city
He has vanquished the Sphinx:
he promises
The plague falls on us
Thebes is dying of plague
From the plague preserve us...
...for Thebes is dying
Oedipus, the plague has come
Free our city from plague!
Preserve our dying city!
Citizens!
I shall free you!
I shall free you from the plague!
I, illustrious Oedipus, love you
I, Oedipus, shall preserve you
Save us, save our city, Oedipus!
Save us, famous Oedipus!
What must be done, Oedipus...
...that we may be delivered?
The brother of my wife was sent...
...to consuIt the oracle
Creon was sent to the god
He is asking of the oracle
what must be done
May Creon make haste!
HaiI, Creon!
We hearken!
Speak!
We greet you and hearken!
Creon, the brother-in-law of Oedipus,
has returned from Delphi
The oracle demands that
Laius' murderer be punished
The assassin is hiding in Thebes
At whatever cost,
he must be discovered
Oedipus boasts of his skill in
dealing with the powers of darkness
He has solved the riddle of the Sphinx
He will discover and drive out
the assassin
The god has answered:
Avenge Laius!
Avenge the crime!
Discover the murderer!
The murderer is hiding in Thebes
The murderer of the king is hiding
He must be discovered!
Purge Thebes!
Purge Thebes of its stain!
Avenge the death of the king...
...of the slain king Laius!
The murderer is hiding in Thebes
He must be discovered, for the god
demands he be driven from us
He infects Thebes with plague
Apollo has spoken, the god
You cannot solve the ancient crime
I shall scour Thebes
The criminaI dwells in Thebes
The god has spoken
He has spoken to you
He must deliver himself to me
Entrust this task to me
I shall scour Thebes
I shall drive him out of Thebes
You cannot solve the ancient crime
- The criminal dwells in Thebes
- The god has spoken
I solved the riddle of the Sphinx
Again I shall divine the riddle,
I, illustrious Oedipus
Again I shall preserve Thebes
I, Oedipus, shall divine the riddle
Solve it!
- I promise to divine
- Solve it, Oedipus, solve it!
Illustrious Oedipus speaks:
I promise, I shall divine it
Oedipus questions Tiresias...
...Tiresias, the seer,
the fountain of truth
Tiresias will not answer
He already realises that Oedipus is
a plaything of the heartless gods
This silence angers Oedipus
He accuses Creon of desiring
the throne for himself...
...and Tiresias of being his accomplice
RevoIted by the injustice of
this attitude, Tiresias speaks
This is the oracle:
The assassin of the king is the king
God of Delos, we are waiting
Minerva, daughter of Jove...
...Diana enthroned...
...and you, Phoebus, splendid archer,
come to our aid!
For swiftly rushes the winged evil
Death follows hard upon death...
...and corpses lie unburied in heaps
Drive forth...
...cast into the sea
the dreadfuI Mars...
...who, unarmed, murders our people,
howling madly
And you, Bacchus,
come swiftly with your torch...
...to burn out the most infamous
of all the gods
HaiI, Tiresias,
famous man, prophet!
Tell us what the god demands!
Speak quickly, learned priest!
I cannot speak
I am not allowed to speak
To speak would be a sin
Oedipus, I cannot!
Force me not to speak!
Beware lest I speak!
Illustrious Oedipus,
allow me to be silent!
Your silence accuses you!
You are the murderer!
Pitiable man, I speak
Since you accuse me, I speak
I shall speak what the god has said
No word will I conceal
The murderer is in your midst
The murderer is near you
He is one of you
The king is the king's murderer
The king slew Laius
The king slew the king
The god accuses the king!
The murderer is the king!
The king must be driven from Thebes
A guiIty king pollutes the city
The king is the king's murderer
Envy hates the fortunate
You made me king
I saved you by answering the riddles...
...and you made me king
The riddle had to be solved,
who was to solve it?
You, famous man, prophet?
It was solved by me...
...and you made me king
Envy hates the fortunate
There is one who wants my place
Creon wants the king's place
You have been bribed, Tiresias!
I shall lay bare this plot!
Creon would be king
Who freed you from the riddles?
Friends!
It was I, famed Oedipus, l
Envy hates the fortunate
They want to destroy the king...
...famed Oedipus, your king
Glory!
All praise to Queen Jocasta...
...in plague-ridden Thebes!
ln plague-ridden Thebes...
...all praise to our queen!
All praise to Oedipus' wife!
The dispute of the princes
attracts Jocasta
You will hear her calm them...
...and shame them for raising
their voices...
...in a stricken city
She proves that oracles lie
An oracle predicted that Laius
would perish by the hand of her son
Whereas Laius was murdered
by thieves...
...at the crossing of three roads
from Daulis and Delphi
Three roads, crossroads!
Mark well those words!
They horrify Oedipus
He remembers how, in Corinth,
before encountering the Sphinx...
...he killed an old man
where three roads met
lf Laius of Thebes were that man...
...what then?
Oedipus cannot return to Corinth...
...having been threatened by
the oracle with a double crime...
...killing his father
and marrying his mother
Oedipus is afraid
Are you not ashamed, princes...
...to bicker and howl
in a stricken city...
...raising up your personaI complaints?
Princes, are you not ashamed?
Are you not ashamed,
in a stricken city...
...to contest your personaI quarrels?
Are you not ashamed
to clamour before everyone...
...to raise up your personaI broils
in a stricken city?
Are you not ashamed, princes?
Oracles are not to be trusted
They always lie
Oracles...
...they are all liars
By whom was the king to be slain?
By my son
WelI, the king was slain
Laius died at the crossroads
Oracles are not to be trusted
They always lie
- Laius died at the crossroads
- The crossroads!
- Oracles are not to be trusted
- The crossroads!
- They always lie
- The crossroads!
Beware of oracles!
I am afraid suddenly, Jocasta
I am terribly afraid
Jocasta, listen!
Did you speak of the crossroads?
I killed an old man...
...when I was coming from Corinth...
...killed him at the crossroads
Oracles are always liars
Oedipus, beware of oracles!
They tell lies
- I am suddenly greatly afraid
- Beware of oracles!
- A great fear has come on me
- Let us go home!
I killed a man at the crossroads
Let us return home quickly!
- I want to find out the truth
- There is no truth here
There is truth, Jocasta
I want to see the shepherd
He still lives,
he who witnessed the crime
Jocasta, I must find out the truth
I must know!
A messenger, announcing that
king Polybus of Corinth is dead...
...reveals to Oedipus that he is only
an adopted son of the king
Jocasta understands
She tries to draw Oedipus back,
in vain
She flees
Oedipus supposes she is ashamed
of being the wife of an upstart
Oh, this lofty, all-discerning Oedipus!
He is in the snare
He alone does not know it
And then the truth strikes him
Oedipus falls.
He falls headlong!
The shepherd who knows all is here...
...and the messenger of dread tidings
Polybus is dead
Old Polybus is dead
He was not Oedipus' father
Polybus got him from me
I took him to the king
He was not Oedipus' reaI father
His adopted father, by my doing!
His adopted father, by your doing!
I found on the mountain
the child Oedipus...
...abandoned on the mountain,
the infant Oedipus...
...his feet pierced...
...his feet wounded
I found the infant Oedipus
on the mountain...
...and took to the shepherd
the child Oedipus
I am about to hear a prodigious tale
Oedipus was born of a great god...
...and a nymph of the mountain
on which he was found
Silence was better, not speech
Indeed he found the infant Oedipus...
...by father, by mother
abandoned on the mountain...
...his feet pierced, tied
You should not have spoken
This should always have been hidden
Silence was better, not speech
Surely we shall hear a prodigious tale
I shall find out Oedipus' lineage
Jocasta is ashamed, she flees
She is ashamed of Oedipus the exile,
ashamed of Oedipus' parents
I shall find out Oedipus' lineage
I shall find out my origin
Surely we shall hear a prodigious tale
I shall find out Oedipus' lineage,
the origin of my exile
I, an exile, exuIt
On the mountain he was found,
abandoned by his mother
He is the son of Laius and Jocasta
Slayer of Laius, his parent
Husband of Jocasta, his parent
It would have been better
never to speak this thing
Abandoned by Jocasta,
he was found on the mountain
I was born of whom
divine law forbade
I have lain with whom
divine law forbade
I have slain whom
divine law forbade
All now is made clear!
And now you will hear the chorus...
...recount the horrible end of Jocasta
The queen locks herself in her room
She tears her hair. She grieves
Oedipus pounds on the doors
He breaks open the lock and enters
His eyes behold a terrible sight
Oedipus takes the golden pin
from the queen's hair
He pierces his eyes
He must show himself to all...
...as an incestuous monster,
a fatherkiller, a fool!
Gently, very gently...
...his people drive him away
Farewell, king Oedipus!
We loved you!
The divine Jocasta is dead!
In her chamber she tore at her hair
She shut herself in, crying aloud
And Oedipus rushed in and pounded
on the doors, howling wildly
The divine Jocasta is dead!
And when he broke open the lock,
everyone beheld the woman hanging
And Oedipus, rushing headlong,
loosened her and laid her down
And with a golden pin plucked
from her, he gouged out his eyes
The black blood flowed
The divine Jocasta is dead!
The black blood flowed
The black blood gushed forth
Oedipus howled and cursed himself
He shows himself to all
Behold through the open doors...
...behold the sad spectacle!
Behold the most horrible of all sights!
The divine Jocasta is dead!
Behold! Oedipus the king...
...appears a most foul monster!
Lo, Oedipus the king!
Lo, the blind king, the parricide king!
Poor king Oedipus, solver of riddles
He is here! Lo!
Lo! Oedipus the king!
Farewell, Oedipus!
I loved you, I pity you
Wretched Oedipus...
...I lament the loss of your eyes
Farewell Oedipus, our poor Oedipus!
I loved you, Oedipus
I bid you farewell, Oedipus,
I bid you farewell
