- Were you early, Auntie?
- No, I just got here.
Where's your father today?
At home with that manuscript
that was due yesterday.
You know, the moths have ruined
your uncle's striped trousers.
Could Katsuyoshi wear them?
Wouldn't Bu-chan
look odd in striped pants?
It doesn't matter.
What if you just snip off the legs?
I guess I could.
Give it a try.
Here.
You brought them?
Don't go to too much trouble.
They won't last much longer.
But reinforce the seat.
I'm sorry I rushed ahead...
though I did wait for you
at Shinbashi Station.
I missed my train.
Please forgive the delay.
We will now begin.
Eraser.
Found it?
Here it is.
"Friedrich List. "
You're right, there's no Z. L-I-S-T.
That's what I thought.
Liszt was the musician.
"1811 to 1886."
Electric company.
Meter check.
Go ahead.
May I borrow a stool?
- Where is it?
- Under the hallway stairs.
Sorry for the bother.
- Not at all.
Here you are.
Professor,
List was self-taught, wasn't he?
Yes.
He was an eminent economist
of the historical school.
He really hated bureaucracy.
- The bill's on the counter.
- Thank you.
How many pages so far?
- Twelve or thirteen.
- Okay.
Six or seven more to go.
I'm home.
I'm home.
Welcome, Mr. Hattori.
- Forgive my intrusion.
Making the clean copy?
Thanks for saving me the trouble.
- Where's your aunt?
- She had to rush home.
Make us some tea.
Can you stay for dinner?
Not today, I'm afraid.
Why not? We all have to go
into Tokyo tomorrow.
Why do you have to go?
For the hospital.
And to buy you some new collars.
Professor,
we miscalculated
my mah-jongg hand the other day.
We did?
Which means 8 and 16?
So I was the winner after all.
Say, Noriko.
Is Sei at home?
- What for?
Go ask.
We'll play a round.
Have you finished writing?
Yes. Well, almost.
No game, then.
Where's that tea?
Did you bring the manuscript?
Yes, don't worry.
Want to sit down?
No, I'm all right.
- Coming home at the usual time?
- Yes.
Unless there's a faculty meeting.
Be careful going home.
- Professor Onodera!
- Hello!
- When did you get into town?
- Yesterday morning.
You're looking healthy and plump.
- Really?
Where are you headed?
- Shopping.
- May I join you?
- You're not busy?
- No, my work's done.
There's an art exhibit.
Shall we have a look?
But I need sewing needles.
Okay, let's go.
ART ASSOCIATIONS'
JOINT EXHIBIT
TAKIGAWA RESTAURANT
You must be tired.
But I'm glad I went.
I hadn't been to Ueno in ages.
But you know, there were
some horrible people there.
Did you see the guy shooting
his air gun at that pigeon on the statue?
Just like William Tell!
Here you are.
Professor Shigeno
dropped by last night.
Oh? Is he still in town?
He went home this morning.
By the way,
this is Somiya's daughter.
Really?
And all grown up now.
The one who had bobbed hair?
- That's the one.
- You don't say.
Your father comes here often.
Welcome.
- Shall I warm some sake?
- Yes, please.
Nori-chan,
would you like a sip?
No, thank you.
Something else, then?
Or something to eat?
I'm fine for now.
Allow me.
- Thanks.
Bring us a little something.
- Yes, sir.
You know...
I heard that -
What?
That you remarried.
Yes, I did.
- I feel sorry for Misako.
- Why?
It's just...
strange, don't you think?
Doesn't seem that way.
They get along quite well.
I wonder.
I'd find it distasteful.
What's distasteful?
My wife?
No. You!
Why?
It seems... indecent.
Indecent?
- Filthy, actually.
- Filthy?
How far I've fallen!
Filthy, eh?
Any better?
- I'm afraid not.
No good, eh?
I'm really at a loss.
Really! Indecent, eh?
- That's right.
I've really gone and done it,
haven't I?
I'm home.
I'm back,
and I brought a guest.
Who?
- Hey there.
- Well, well.
I was on my way home
when I ran into Nori-chan.
In town on a business trip?
Yes, the education ministry again.
Father, I brought you something.
Where'd you finally find them?
Well, they certainly
weren't here at home.
Ta da!
You found them at Takigawa?
You went there?
Yes, I made her
keep me company all day long.
- More sake?
- That would be great.
- Do we have any?
- Warm it up, please.
How was your blood count?
- Down to 15.
- Really? That's good.
She's looking much healthier.
It was forced labor
during the war that made her ill.
And spending her rare days off
lugging home potatoes.
Terrible times.
How she must have suffered.
I'm afraid there wasn't much.
Don't you worry.
Is your family well?
- Yes, but it seems I've sinned.
- How so?
Nori-chan insists it's indecent.
- What is?
- I am.
She says I'm filthy.
Don't you, Nori-chan?
That's right.
Is Misa-chan well?
Somehow she got the idea in her head
that marriage is life's graveyard.
She refuses to marry
before the age of 24.
Come to think of it,
she may be right.
Anyway, there's nothing I can do.
But what about Nori-chan?
Yes, it's time
I did something about her.
She's 27, right?
- It's lukewarm.
- Let me -
That's okay, but make
the next one warmer.
Are you close to the sea here?
A 15-minute walk.
That's rather far.
Is it on this side?
No, that side.
And the shrine
is over this way, right?
No, that way.
- Which way is Tokyo?
- That way.
- So east is this direction?
- No, that direction.
- Has it always been that way?
- Absolutely.
No wonder Yoritomo
moved his shogunate here.
The enemy
couldn't find its way around!
You all right?
Not too tired?
No, I'm fine.
So which type am I?
Let's see.
I'd say you're not the jealous type.
Oh, but I am.
You sure?
As the saying goes,
when I slice pickled radish,
it comes out
all strung together.
That's a matter of the relative interaction
between you and the knife.
There's no logical connection between
pickled radish and jealousy, now is there?
So you like pickles
strung together?
At times I wouldn't mind them.
You don't say?
Young people have changed
so much since our day.
Take that bride last night.
She comes from a good family,
yet she plowed into the food
and even drank sake.
Gobbling up sashimi
with that big painted mouth -
I was shocked.
Of course she ate.
Food was scarce for so long.
At my wedding, I was too filled
with gratitude to eat a single rice ball.
If it were today,
you'd eat plenty.
Never.
But I guess
there's no way to know.
- You'd eat.
- Perhaps.
- No doubt about it.
- Okay, I would.
But I wouldn't eat the sashimi.
- Yes, you would.
- You think so?
- Absolutely.
You don't want a bride whimpering
from sadness at leaving home,
but if she seems
entirely unaffected -
Can't be helped these days.
What about Nori?
She's not the whimpering kind.
That's not what I meant.
What about her marriage?
Her health is better, right?
Yes, but -
She should have married long ago.
What about that young man?
- Who?
Your assistant.
Hattori?
Well? How about him?
He's a nice young man,
but I don't know how Noriko feels.
They spend time together.
Nothing serious, though.
How can you know
how she feels deep inside?
- Maybe you're right.
- I am.
That's how
the younger generation is.
Why don't you ask?
- Who?
- Nori-chan.
- About what?
How she feels about Hattori.
Indeed. Perhaps I should.
It's the only way
we'll ever know.
One never can tell.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You're early.
- Was the train crowded?
- No, I got a seat.
Your aunt sent some pickles.
They're in the bag.
You have a PEN Club meeting
on the 28th.
We're meeting
at the country club this time.
That's this Saturday.
Mr. Hattori was here.
When?
Just past noon.
Would you like dinner now?
We took a bike ride together.
- You and Hattori?
- The beach was delightful.
- Did he have news for me?
- No, not really.
Noriko! A towel!
- Did you share one bike?
- Goodness, no! I borrowed one.
- We're out of soap.
- Really?
My sash.
So Shichirigahama was nice, eh?
- Yes. We went to Chigasaki too.
- I see.
Try some of this.
What do you think of Hattori?
Think of him?
Yes.
He's quite nice.
Would he make
a good husband?
I'm sure he would.
Think so?
- He's so kind.
- Yes, he is.
I like his type.
You aunt was wondering
how he would be.
For what?
For you to marry.
- What is it?
- Tea! Some tea, please.
What's so funny?
He's already engaged.
Has been for a very long time.
She's very sweet and beautiful.
Three years behind me at school.
- I see.
He'll tell you about it soon.
I know the girl very well.
I see.
We should send a gift.
I see.
So Hattori's getting married.
What should we get them?
So he's already engaged?
- What would you like?
- Gosh, that's hard to say.
Just a hint.
If it's from the professor,
something to remember him by.
We can only spend
about 3,000 yen.
- I'm not sure.
- Anything around that price?
Let me think about it.
- With your fianc√©e?
- Yes, that's right.
Do you want to hear
the violinist Mari Iwamoto?
- When?
- Tonight. I have tickets.
How nice.
You bought them for me?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Of course.
- Are you sure?
I think I'll pass.
She might get the wrong idea.
- It's all right. Let's go.
- No.
- She won't mind.
- I'm still not going.
Pickled radish strung together?
Yes. My blade
must be getting dull.
MARI IWAMOTO
SOLO VIOLIN RECITAL
Good evening.
- Who's there?
- Mr. Somiya?
- Is that you, Aya?
- Yes.
- Good evening.
- Come in.
- Is Noriko in?
- She'll be home soon. Come in.
Please join me.
I was visiting
my sister in Hayama.
I hear you've been
doing well lately.
In what way?
You're getting a lot of work.
Not that much.
I hear typists
are in great demand.
I'm not a typist.
I'm a stenographer!
I see. Sorry.
You can do English shorthand too?
- I sure can.
- That's outstanding.
- Not really.
Yes, it is.
You must earn a lot.
- The pay's not bad.
- I see.
Are your parents
still bothering you?
- How do you mean?
- To remarry.
No, not for some time...
fortunately.
Once was enough?
What, marriage?
I wouldn't say that.
- What was his name?
- Who?
- Your ex-husband.
- Ah, Ken.
Yes, Kenkichi.
Do you ever see him?
Never.
- And if you did?
- I'd glare daggers at him.
- You hate him that much?
- I'd run away. I detest him.
Is that so?
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.
- What's wrong?
- My legs fell asleep.
Here for a visit, Aya?
I'm back.
- Welcome home.
- We had a little chat.
- You staying tonight? Let's go upstairs.
- Did you have dinner?
- I'm fine. You've eaten, right?
- Yes.
- Let's go.
- Why'd you miss our class reunion?
- Did a lot of people go?
About 15,
including Lady Tsubaki.
Was Professor Murase there,
foaming at the mouth as usual?
Yes. She spit all over the place.
Even in our tea.
Nobody sitting next to her
drank theirs.
I was at a safe distance.
Was she there, the one
who married right after graduation?
Ah, Ikegami?
Yes, she was.
She's a sly one.
She told Lady Tsubaki
she only has three children.
But she has four.
She fudged by one.
- Four already?
- Yes.
"Square-jaw Shinoda" was there too.
- Really?
She left her job
at the radio station to get married.
Really? To whom?
- A fusspot in the Mikawajima barracks.
- Really?
I'm just guessing,
but doesn't it fit?
- Some bread and tea.
- You shouldn't have.
Anything else you need?
- There's no sugar.
- You're right.
Don't bother. I'll get it.
I'll be turning in, then.
Good night, Aya.
Good night.
- Would you like some bread?
- A little later.
Did he forget the spoons too?
- Alas, he did.
Was Watanabe there?
Kuro-chan?
She couldn't make it.
Her tummy is this big.
Seven months along.
When did she get married?
She didn't.
That's horrible.
These things happen.
Everything is divine providence.
Only you and Hirokawa
haven't married yet.
Really?
When are you going
to get married?
I'm not going to.
Hurry up and get married.
- I don't want to.
- Get on with it.
Who are you to lecture me
about marriage?
I'm an authority
on the subject.
Authority?
You're a divorc√©e.
So what?
I only have one "out. "
Next time I'll get a run.
Still stepping up to bat?
Why not?
I just struck out.
Next time I'll crack it
out of the park.
Come on.
Hurry up and get married.
What's so funny?
I'm serious.
How about that bread now?
That can wait.
I'm starving.
Never mind that.
Then I'll eat alone.
I'd like some too, actually.
I'll get it ready.
- You have any jam?
- Yes.
- Could you bring just a bit?
- You mean a lot... "actually"?
Yes.
Bu-chan.
Why don't you go play ball?
Did you get in a fight?
Bu-chan,
why are you so angry?
The paint won't dry.
What paint?
On my bat.
- You painted your bat red?
- Yeah.
There's paint all over the hallway.
Your mother will get angry.
- She already did.
- Did you cry?
No, I didn't!
Leave me alone, you nag.
Big talk for a crybaby.
What?
I'll get you with this.
Get out.
Crybaby.
- Noriko.
- Has your guest left?
She's on her way out.
Come down a minute.
Cut it out!
You're grounded today.
This is Mr. Somiya's daughter, Noriko.
This is Mrs. Miwa.
I see you often in Kamakura.
Do forgive my staying so long.
- Not at all.
- If you'll excuse me.
- Thank you for coming.
Nori-chan,
do you have a moment?
Have a seat.
What is it, Auntie?
Isn't it time you got married?
That again?
Leave it be, Auntie.
I will not leave it be.
Sit down.
I have a fine prospect.
Won't you meet him?
His name is Satake.
He studied science at Tokyo University.
He's from a good family.
He works at Nitto Chemicals.
His father was a director there
until the war.
He's 34.
Just right for you.
His office speaks highly of him.
What do you say?
He looks like that American.
The man in that baseball movie.
Gary Cooper?
That's right, Cooper.
Looks just like him.
He has the exact same mouth.
The top half is different, though.
How about it?
Please meet him.
He's a fine young man.
What do you say?
I don't want
to get married yet.
You don't? Why not?
Why not?
It would create
all sorts of problems.
How so?
For Father.
I'm used to him
and can handle him,
but you know
he can be difficult.
If I left home,
Father would be lost.
That can't be helped.
I'm the only one
who knows what he needs.
Forget about your father for now.
What about you?
I couldn't do that to him.
Then you can never get married.
I don't care.
Nori-chan, that Mrs. Miwa -
how would she be
for your father?
What do you mean?
Your father will need someone
if you leave home.
I was wondering
if she would do.
Come and sit back down.
She had a good husband,
but he died,
leaving her with no children.
She's had a pitiable life.
She's a sensible woman
with good taste.
Have you spoken
to Father about this?
I did mention it
the other day.
What did he say?
He just grunted and cleaned his pipe.
He didn't seem to object.
Then why even ask me?
I want to know
your feelings too.
It's fine with me,
if it's fine with him.
Welcome home.
What did your aunt have to say?
Nothing special.
I had Shige heat up the bath.
The water's just right.
What?
What did your aunt want?
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
Where are you going?
Shopping.
Hello.
Look who's here.
They're both out today.
They left early this morning.
- I see.
They were going
to see a Noh play.
I see. In that case,
would you give them this?
Yes, of course.
Please convey
my thanks as well.
Of course.
I'm sorry you missed them.
Thank you for your visit.
Should I chop up
more kindling?
Yes, but first take
a gander at this.
Why, it's Mr. Hattori.
I always figured
he'd marry Miss Noriko one day.
Amazing.
Looks just like him.
And such a beautiful bride.
The iris hedge planted...
next to our old home;
Only the color remains
as it was back then.
Only the color remains
as it was back then.
The color carries with it...
the name of that man
from long ago.
The scent
of wild orange flowers...
mingles together
with the sprig
of blue flag in his hair.
Iris and blue flag,
so much alike;
Whose color is deeper?
Crying in the trees,
the cicada sheds
its brocade gown...
revealing sleeves as white
as deutzia blossoms,
as white as the snow.
Day breaks.
Pale purple clouds to the east
herald Amida Buddha's coming.
The pale purple iris
opens its petals to enlightenment,
along with the folds of her heart.
All the earth will be enlightened,
even the flowers and trees.
All the earth will be enlightened,
even the flowers and trees.
Today's performance
was quite good.
Shall we eat at Takigawa?
What do you say?
I have something
I need to do.
- What's that?
- It's not important.
- Will you be late?
- I don't know.
Sorry I kept you waiting.
I couldn't leave the shortcake
I was making.
I put in too much vanilla,
but it's good.
Let's go into the other room.
Your hands are so cold!
Fumi, please serve
the cake in the other room.
How'd that idea
enter your head?
Tell me. How?
It just did.
Have some?
- Is it very difficult?
- What?
- Stenography.
- Not really.
How hard can it be
if I can do it?
Come on, try some.
It's good.
But what do you
hope to accomplish?
What do you intend to do?
Anything I can.
You can't go to work
for no reason.
If Ken hadn't been so awful,
I certainly wouldn't be working now.
But I couldn't face
moving back in with my parents.
Just hurry up
and get married.
- I don't want advice like that.
- I'll give it to you anyway.
I don't want it.
If you'll do "anything,"
might as well get married.
- Not eating?
- I don't want it.
- Have some.
- I don't feel like it.
- It's good.
- I don't want any.
Just a bite.
I worked so hard to bake it!
I don't want any.
Eat it.
I'll make you eat if I have to.
- I said I didn't want any.
- Why so hysterical? Fine, don't eat it.
This just shows
you need a man.
Where are you going?
- Home.
You're leaving?
Weren't you going to stay the night?
Please don't go.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
Where have you been?
At Aya's.
A letter came from your aunt.
She wants you
to come by on Saturday.
That's the day after tomorrow.
She told you about him,
didn't she?
Just meet him once.
He'll be there.
Can't I just refuse?
At least meet him.
You can always turn him down.
Come here.
Sit.
I'm sure you've heard
about this Satake from your aunt.
I've met him.
He's a fine young man.
I don't think
you'll be disappointed.
Go see for yourself.
You can't stay here forever.
You have to marry
sooner or later.
I think it's about time.
What do you say?
Your aunt is very concerned.
Well?
But I...
I want to stay with you.
That's out of the question.
Of course, it would make
my life much easier.
- Then why not?
- Because it's not right.
I've let you take care of me
for too long.
I didn't want to give you up.
For that I owe you an apology.
I'll be quite upset
if you don't marry.
But what will happen to you?
I'll manage.
- How?
- One way or another.
But I can't get married.
Why?
You'd never wash
your shirts and collars.
You wouldn't even shave
in the morning.
Oh, I'd shave.
If I didn't clean your desk,
nobody would.
Remember when you tried
to cook rice and burned it?
You'd be eating
burnt rice every day.
You'd be helpless, I know.
Well, what if I were to say
that you needn't worry
about any of that?
What if somebody else
looked after me?
Somebody else?
It's just a possibility.
You intend to do
what Mr. Onodera did?
Take another wife?
You'd marry again?
That woman we saw today?
It's definite?
Really?
Is that true?
Father, leave me alone.
Go back downstairs.
You'll go, won't you?
Day after tomorrow?
We're all so worried about you.
You will go, won't you?
Do it for me.
We'll have nice weather
again tomorrow.
So what did she say?
She didn't say anything.
But it's been a week
since I introduced them.
I have to give them an answer.
I realize that.
But pestering her
could ruin everything.
The other side
is eager to proceed.
I really don't see how Noriko
could find fault with him.
She likes him.
I'm sure she does.
Why did she go
to Tokyo again today?
You're not taking this seriously.
I must have her answer today.
When will she be back?
- I don't know.
Look, I found a change purse.
What good luck!
The wedding will come off.
Aren't you turning it in?
I will. But it's such a good omen.
Let's go.
What was he like?
What type?
Fat?
- No.
- So he was skinny?
- No.
Well, which was it?
He says he played
basketball in college.
Is he good-looking?
Tell me!
My aunt thinks he looks
like Gary Cooper.
What more could you want?
You've always liked Gary Cooper.
I think he looks more
like our electrician.
Does your electrician
look like Cooper?
Yes... very much so.
Then he must look like Cooper!
Really now!
I'll slap you!
I'm impressed.
You actually went and met him.
He sounds good.
What's there to think about?
Go on, marry him.
Good men are rare these days.
Grab him.
- But I don't like it.
- What?
Arranged marriage.
Don't be picky.
You'd never marry
unless someone arranged it.
- But -
- It's true, isn't it?
If you found someone
you liked,
would you walk up
and propose?
You're not that bold.
You'd just blush
and squirm in your seat.
That's true.
An arranged marriage
suits someone like you.
Mine wasn't arranged,
and look what happened to me.
Men are no good.
They're devious.
Before marriage
they only show their good side,
but once they have you,
everything awful comes out.
You never know what you're getting,
even marrying for love.
- You may be right.
- I am right.
Go ahead and marry.
If he's no good, leave him.
It's simple, I tell you.
Anyway, marry him.
Just smile at him sweetly.
He'll definitely fall for you.
Then you've got him pinned.
- The things you say!
That's how it is.
You think I'm joking?
- You just may be.
- There! That's the smile to use.
Just try it.
I'm sure it'll work.
Noriko's very late.
Maybe I should come back
another time.
Wait a little.
She'll be on the next train.
If you say so.
I hope she'll agree.
She will.
She likes him.
You think so?
She's shy. Old-fashioned
for somebody her age.
I guess so.
- Maybe some detail is bothering her.
- Like what?
Like his name.
Kumataro Satake?
- Kumataro - "Bear Boy. "
- What's wrong with it? It sounds tough.
If anybody's old-fashioned, it's you.
That wouldn't bother her.
But doesn't it make you think
of hairy chests and things?
That bothers young ladies
more than you imagine.
And what should I call him
if they get married?
"Kumataro" sounds like
a mountain bandit,
"Kuma-san" is used
for common bumpkins,
and "Kuma-chan"
sounds like "baby bear. "
Well, we have
to call him something.
That's the point.
I think I'll call him "Ku-chan. "
"Little Vacuum"?
What do you think?
She's back.
I'm home.
Here she comes.
Yes, I think that's definitely -
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.
What do you think?
I'll go ask her.
- Listen.
- What?
- Be tactful.
- Don't worry.
- Noriko, welcome home.
- Thanks.
So... what's your answer?
How about it?
Have you given it some thought?
Come on, tell me.
I think it's really a good match,
don't you?
Well, will you marry him?
Answer me.
Yes.
You will?
Yes.
Really? You'll do it?
Thank you!
I'll notify them immediately.
All right?
Thank goodness.
What a relief!
- How'd it go?
- She'll marry him, just as I thought.
Really? That's good.
I have to run now.
What a relief.
I'll tell them right away.
- Thanks for everything.
I can still make the 9:35, right?
Yes, but you'd better hurry.
My worries are over.
I can finally sleep again.
I'll come again to arrange the wedding.
Will you also drop by?
Yes, I will.
Good thing I picked up
this change purse.
You should turn that in.
Don't worry. I will.
Would you close up?
Good night.
Thanks again.
Careful on the way home.
Your aunt just left.
Is that right?
She was ecstatic.
Are you happy
with your decision?
Yes.
You're not doing this
out of resignation, are you?
No.
Or against your will?
Not at all.
I see.
Then it's all right.
- Did you sleep well on the train?
- Yes.
So did I.
When I woke up,
we were already at Seta.
I slept all the way
from Nagoya to Maibara.
Tea and flowers for sale.
Sorry, we were just
freshening up.
- Tired, Noriko?
- No, not very.
Is that so?
I sure am glad you came.
Noriko quite suddenly
decided to get married.
So this is our last trip together.
That's wonderful.
My congratulations.
Congratulations, Noriko.
Tell me: What's he like?
How does he compare with me?
There's no comparison.
Who's better, eh?
You're much more handsome.
Really?
Just for that,
lunch is on me.
Why don't we eat
at the Hyotei?
Sounds good.
Misako wants to see you.
I want to see her too.
Do you mind
if "the filthy one" comes along?
You sure it's okay?
Kyoto is so nice and relaxing.
Nothing like this in Tokyo.
Just clouds of dust!
Professor, do you visit
Kyoto from time to time?
I haven't in years.
This is my first trip since the war.
My goodness.
Mr. Somiya!
So, Nori-chan,
does she look filthy to you?
Stop it.
I'd like to hear your thoughts.
Filthy?
What's this all about, Father?
We're talking about indecency.
Isn't that right, Noriko?
We really walked a lot today.
Aren't you tired?
No.
The last time
I went to Kodai Temple,
the bush clover was splendid.
What are your plans
for tomorrow?
Misako is coming
for me at 10:00.
Where are you going?
Why not try the museum?
Sounds nice.
- Shall we turn in?
- Yes.
Shall I turn off the light?
- Yes.
Father.
I didn't know his wife at all,
yet I said such terrible things
to Mr. Onodera.
What did you say?
I mean, his wife
is such a good person.
They make a wonderful couple.
How could I have said
they were filthy?
Don't let it worry you.
What I said was unthinkable.
He never took it seriously.
- You don't think so?
- No.
It's fine.
Father...
even in your case,
I found the idea really distasteful.
It's good
she's finally marrying.
She'll make a good wife,
no doubt about it.
Better to have a son, though.
It's pointless to have a daughter.
You raise them
and then off they go.
If they're unwed, you worry.
Yet if they do marry,
you feel let down.
But didn't we marry
other men's daughters?
You have a point.
Father, please hand me that.
How time flies.
One minute we arrive,
and the next we're leaving.
But I loved it here in Kyoto.
I'm glad we came,
but a day in Nara
would've been nice too.
Why didn't we do this
more often?
This is our last trip together.
You'll be busy
when we get home.
Your aunt is waiting.
I hope we find seats
on the train tomorrow.
I never took you places,
but now your husband will.
Satake will dote on you,
I'm sure.
What is it?
What's the matter?
I...
I want us to stay as we are.
I don't want to go anywhere.
Being with you
is enough for me.
I'm happy just as I am.
Even marriage
couldn't make me any happier.
I'm content with this life.
Yes, but that's -
No, no.
You marry if you want to, Father.
I just want to be
by your side.
I'm so fond of you.
Being with you like this
is my greatest happiness.
Please, Father,
why can't we stay
just as we are?
I know marriage
won't make me any happier.
That's not true.
You'll see.
I'm 56 years old.
My life is nearing its end.
But your life as a couple
is just beginning.
You're starting a new life,
one that you and Satake
must build together.
One in which I play no part.
That's the order
of human life and history.
Marriage may not mean happiness
from the start.
To expect
such immediate happiness
is a mistake.
Happiness isn't something
you wait around for.
It's something
you create yourself.
Getting married isn't happiness.
Happiness lies in the forging
of a new life shared together.
It may take a year or two,
maybe even five or ten.
Happiness comes
only through effort.
Only then can you claim
to be man and wife.
Your own mother wasn't happy
when we married.
For years,
we had our troubles.
Many times I found her
weeping in the kitchen.
But she put up with me.
You must believe in each other
and love one another.
All the love you've shown me
must now be given to Satake.
Do you see?
From this a new happiness
will be born.
You understand, don't you?
You do, don't you?
Yes.
Forgive me
for being so selfish.
So you do understand.
Yes.
I was being very selfish.
I'm glad you understand.
I didn't want you marrying
feeling the way you did.
Marry him.
I'm sure you'll be happy.
It's not difficult.
I'm certain
you'll make a good couple.
I'm looking forward to that day.
Soon you'll look back
on this conversation and laugh.
Forgive me...
for worrying you.
No, just be happy.
You'll try, won't you?
Yes. You'll see.
Yes, I'm sure you'll be happy.
I know you. You will.
I can rest easy.
I know you'll be happy.
It was raining a bit last night.
I was worried.
Fortunately the weather cleared.
Rain would have been terrible.
It certainly would have.
Where was your honeymoon?
Yugawara.
Really?
Noriko's going there too.
Do they only have buses
from the station?
- No, there are taxis too.
- Taxis, eh?
Professor,
you're wanted upstairs.
The bride's ready, and so lovely too.
Go have a look-see.
Is that so?
I'll go look.
She makes a wonderful bride.
- She's all ready.
- I see.
- Are the cars here?
- Yes.
Thank you for all your efforts.
All ready, I see.
We'll go on ahead.
- I'll take this.
- Thank you.
Nori-chan,
you have your fan, right?
Such a beautiful bride.
I wish your mother
could see you.
Well, shall we be going?
We don't want to be rushed.
Anything to say to her?
- No, I've nothing more to say.
- Are you sure?
Then, Nori-chan, let's go.
Father.
For your loving care
these many years...
I thank you.
Be happy,
and be a good wife.
Be happy.
You'll be a good wife,
won't you?
Now, shall we go?
Another drink, Aya-chan?
This is my third.
I can handle five.
I once drank six and then fell down.
- You don't say.
Good to see you again,
Professor.
Your daughter came in the other day
with Professor Onodera.
- So I heard.
- It's amazing. She's so grown up.
She's not here today?
- We just saw her off at Tokyo Station.
She got married today.
- You just came from the wedding?
My congratulations.
- Thank you.
Please come again.
Mr. Somiya.
Where is she now,
I wonder.
- I'd say around Ofuna.
- Probably.
It's going to be lonely
for you though, isn't it?
Not too much.
I'll soon get used to it.
Ready for number four?
Are you...
really going to remarry?
Why do you ask?
Because Noriko was
really worried about it.
That seemed
to bother her most.
Don't do it. Why marry again?
You mustn't.
Okay?
Honestly?
But she wouldn't have married
if she knew I wasn't going to.
What a man!
You're just terrific. I'm very moved.
Don't worry.
You won't be lonely.
I'll come visit now and then.
I promise.
Yes, please do.
I certainly will.
What a wonderful feeling.
Number five!
The end.
You'll really visit, won't you?
I'll be expecting you.
Of course. I promise.
I don't tell lies like you.
- What?
Or at least
not as convincingly.
What else could I do?
It was the biggest lie of my life.
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.
Did Noriko get off all right?
Yes, thank you.
I'm glad. Please accept
my warmest congratulations.
Thank you for everything.
Well, good night.
Give my regards to Sei.
Good night.
THE END
