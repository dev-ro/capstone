Andre, you're mad! Youre mad!
Oh,Je-
No, no, no!
No! No! No! Aah!
Oh, shit.
Oh, sorry, Captain.
I didnt recognize you.
- Anything serious?
- Oh, usual business.
Carry on.
Suppose Im the force now.
Come on!
Hey. Hey. Shh!
Come here, guys. Come, come, come.
Andre.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Hold it-
There you are.
All right, um, I would like
to toast my best friend, Andre...
- Yeah!
- Cheers.
who has had the good fortune to marry
the most beautiful woman in our country.
In all Africa!
Excuse me. Sorry. I stand corrected.
He's had the good fortune-
- You've said that.
- Cause its worth repeating, you lucky bastard.
You get to marry her twice.
Do not screw it up this time. Okay?
Youre getting a second chance at this.
So just enrich our numbers
with some new Stander blood!
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!
Yes! Oh, yes!
You are bastards!
Bastards all of you!
Where are you, Andre?
With you on a beach.
But were 18.
Its America.
Fort Lauderdale.
Rock and roll is playing.
Were running through the surf.
And have you lost our hotel keys yet?
Im gonna take you back there.
- Youre crazy.
- I will. Youlll see.
Youre crazy.
All I need is you.
I want it to be different now, Bekk.
I need you to help me this time.
I need you to tell me I wont
get sucked back into the muck.
You can do it, Andre.
Just promise me that whatever undercover
crime-infested hippie drug den you find yourself in...
that I'll be there.
In your thoughts, I mean.
Promise.
- Hah!
- No!
Hey. Hey.
Bad business, Andre.
Single woman. Shes about 32.
Dead maybe 8 or 10 hours.
Its clearly murder,
but theress no motive we can make out.
- Wounds are vicious.
- Looks like a serrated edge.
- Think she knew the guy?
- Theres no signs of forced entry.
Not much of a struggle either.
Well need shots of the bedroom as well.
- And check the bathroom door and the taps for prints.
- Wheres the child?
She had a girl, maybe 5 years old.
Any sign of her?
That child was here last night.
We have a murder-kidnapping.
- And if we don't move fast, that list will grow.
- I'll get you the reports-
Youre in charge, Cor.
Get used to it.
Ive got a date with my wife.
In the wake of rioting...
which broke out in Soweto two days ago...
violence continues
to erupt in townships...
with students organizing protests...
against Afrikaans
as the language of instruction.
In Tembisa, a number of schools and
administration buildings have been torched.
Municipal beer halls and liquor stores
have been burned down...
and police have erected
roadblocks at all township entrances.
While the anti-urban terrorism unit
continues to patrol the townships...
all members of the police force
have been placed on riot duty alert.
A number of arrests have been made.
What is going to happen, Andre?
The Department of Bantu Education...
has closed all schools
in Soweto and Alexandra.
Shotgun.
Whats this?
Live rounds today, no extra charge.
Courtesy of the general.
Too many of you caught changing
the rubber for D-cells anyway.
I can feel it, Andre.
Its a bad day.
Dont, Cor.
It'll be fine.
Its Rita.
If anything happens to me-
Of course. And youll do the same
for me with Bekkie, huh?
Yeah.
- Away with Afrikaans! Away!
- Away!
- Away with Afrikaans! Away!
- Away!
- Away with Afrikaans! Away!
- Away!
- More power!
- More power!
- More power!
- More power!
This is a illegal gathering!
The time is now 9::23!
You have three minutes!
At 9::26 you must...
disintegrate!
Thank you very much!
No!
Requesting you that instead of...
making a mockery of this warning...
that you stop this action immediately!
Grenade!
Coming back!
Stop this action immediately!
Stop this action!
Leave this place immediately!
We need backup, quickly!
Hold your fire!
Hold it!
Stop this action immediately!
Now we must take action against you!
Notice! You have been warned!
Fire at will!
Get him out of here!
- You know the policy on this?
- Not at all.
- He will.
- Captain!
Think well get overtime on this?
Jesus! Andre!
Andre, whats wrong?
Andre!
Andre, its okay-
Its okay! Itss okay!
Andre! Itsss all right!
Come on! Come on!
Its all right. Its all right.
Its all right.
Harold told me you was coming.
Why do the wrong ones
keep dying, Pa?
I shot a man today.
Speak English, Dad, please.
If you hadnt shot him, what then?
- The riots would continue, sir.
- And then?
Maybe they would take power.
Eventually they will.
They would kill us, those of us who stayed.
Wouldnt they?
Maybe they're not like us.
This country would become
like the rest of Africa-
impoverished,
disease-ridden, corrupt.
Popular leaders who murder their own
people, steal millions from the treasury...
and then go off
to die of cancer in Swiss clinics.
Our blacks have the highest standard
of living on the continent.
Son, you helped the Africans today-
By murdering unarmed men?
unless you call this a weapon.
You cant avoid riot duty,
Stander. No one likes it.
Some of them do.
Let them do it.
You've discussed this with your father?
He has nothing to do with this.
Yes. Riot squad is an important part
of your duty, like it or not.
And asking to be relieved from it-
Youre making a good name for yourself.
Youre the youngest captain in the force.
You know what this
will mean to your career.
I realize what this will mean to me, sir.
For Gods sake.
To you
Sorry. Didnt mean to wake you.
Dont you do this to me.
Dontt you dare shut me out. Its me.
I wasn't defending myself.
I wasntt defending my family.
The only thing I maybe
might have been defending...
was my own-
What? Reputation.
And even then, its not mine.
Saving Stander face.
Holding up my end.
Which is a bullshit excuse...
for my shooting people, killing people.
You've got to stop this.
You know, the truly amazing thing is-
amazing-
don't even feel worse than I do.
Please... just-
Dont.
Please don't.
Oh, for Christs sake.
Where the hell is everyone?
They've all been called up.
That bomb in Soweto.
They have to enforce a curfew.
And meanwhile
we let everything go to shit here.
You know, a white man could
get away with anything today...
while the police
are too busy crushing the blacks!
Coming for lunch, sir?
Terrifically busy.
Thank you.
Newspaper. Newspaper.
Newspaper. Newspaper.
Newspaper. Newspaper.
Paper, paper, paper.
Hey! Hey, excuse me!
Did you see what he did?
He just comes barging in, pushing past.
Jesus!
I mean, were a queue here.
We are all waiting.
Youre not the only one in a hurry.
What if we all did that, eh?
It would be a bit of a mess,
wouldnt it?
I don't know.
After all, this is a bank.
Youre supposed to behave yourself.
Some gentleman!
No. No. No, no, no.
He was wearing- wearing a blue suit...
and, um, big sunglasses on his face,
big sunglasses.
He had big sunglasses and-
and a blue suit. Yes, I think-
You can drop these at lunchtime tomorrow.
I'll be in meetings all day.
And what are these?
Whats got into you?
I blew off some steam.
Thats all I needed.
It wont happen again.
If these are to make up for a week of nothing
but trouble, you can keep your roses.
- But it might cost you the Bolton.
- Oh, no.
Itll only take two men.
I didntt believe him. Only two men.
He said,yeah, two men and a hundred blacks.
A hundred kaffirs.
Thats rich.
What about
one man and 200 kaffirs, huh?
Bring it in.
Well take care of it for you.
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.
Going around the corner!
So, he showed the teller the gun...
and apparently threatened to blow his
head off if he didnt hand over the money.
Anyone else hear that?
uh, no. Apparently
they were quite busy at the time.
And then he exited through the front
of the bank, went into the street.
The security guard pursued him,
but lost him immediately.
Any description?
Evidently the same good looker
that hit the first bank.
Put out an alert and stake out
the downtown banks.
All right.
Thanks, guys.
Late night, Andre..
you've been behaving yourself.
Any news on the kidnapper?
I spoke with the informants, but...
...nothing much is coming back.
Keep at it.
The 68 Nederburg.
All right.
Go ahead.
Oh! Oh.
And two of them, Andre.
Its beautiful. Theyrre beautiful.
We cant-
We cantt afford these.
There were old assets in my family.
I decided it was time to cash in.
Well, you certainly did.
Its time you had something
as lovely as you are.
Tell me everythings all right.
Everythings all right.
Nothing solid.
He keeps his head down,
seems to know where the cameras are.
Generic- six foot, suit, red hair.
Red?
- Probably a disguise.
- Yeah. Right.
I know. Its been a bad day.
You okay now?
Im sure, miss,you've been
through this over and over...
but could you tell me
exactly what you saw?
- You.
- Me?
I mean-
I- I don't know what I mean.
Its just he was,you know...
like you.
Want to take me in, Captain?
I don't know. Some kind of satisfaction.
Fame, maybe?
Well, hes got our attention.
I'll give him that.
He keeps pushing, raising the stakes,
upping the ante.
He's probably contemplating
something daring next.
Something big.
The airport.
The foreign exchange windows.
Morning flight arrivals.
A thousand foreigners,
exchanging dollars, pounds, marks.
- The airport, really? Thats a stretch.
- Maybe.
But I got a feeling about this bugger.
A very strong feeling.
- Take a team, Cor. Stake it out.
- Okay.
Yes, that is a firearm, but I don't intend
to use it. Give me all your money.
Captain Deventer?
What? Three? In an hour?
We just got these in.
He's one smooth oak.
Something on your mind, Cor?
You know, Andre,
if you want to get away...
just you and Bekkie, just to let
things settle away from this madness...
I'll cover for you,
as long as it takes.
I'll keep that in mind.
As a friend, hey,
we all need a change of scenery.
Captain Stander.
Sir, you are under arrest.
I'll have to have your gun, Andre.
Weve had a 90-man team on you, Andre.
What took you so long?
Im not as good as you.
You've gotten better.
Could you please just turn around and
put your hands behind your back, please?
The state of bank robberies
plaguing the Johannesburg area...
could finally come to an end
with a surprising arrest.
The suspect in the so-called "White Collar
Robber Case"has been captured.
In a startling turn of events...
an arrest was made of none other than
Johannesburg police Captain Andre Stander.
The extent of the captains alleged
involvement in the robberies on the Reef...
is not determined at this time,
though 28 charges are pending.
Among them are several counts of
robbery, attempted murder, fraud...
illegal possession of firearms,
forgery and pottering.
More news after this.
I have three sons
who do motorcycle riding.
Their clothes are just caked in mud.
Does the defense have witnesses?
uh, none.
Then do you have a statement,
Captain Stander...
before I consider judgment?
Im tried for robbing banks.
But I have killed unarmed people.
That is not the business
of this court.
Do you have anything more to say?
No.
"The court only
attaches importance...
"to the accuseds reckless
endangerment of innocent people...
"that he had sworn
to his country to protect.
"No account is taken of his prior
record and commendations.
The court sentences former Captain
Andre Stander to 32 years imprisonment. "
Dirty fucking Harry.
He wont last long.
Really? Whos got the balls?
You, Lee?
Hey! That psycho kidnapper
will be out before you.
How does that make you feel, supercop?
Lee McCall.
I used to hit banks...
back home in Australia.
Youre not Australian,you bastard.
Sing the national anthem, then.
Wallaby and Kangaroo
Will ever runnin
be free and... true-
- Im fuckinnno Australian-
- Lee McCall.
You've been inside
11 of the last 12 years.
Bad checks, stolen cars, credit cards.
Small-time habitual.
Hit the bank?
You've never even had an account.
Why, it sounds like you know me.
Your file crossed my desk... once.
"The car must stay full of petrol.
"Ask my father to please empty my treasure
chest and put the money in the boot.
"Shift the seat back please, Bekk,
I may be handcuffed.
"I feel like the lowest of the low
for asking you these things.
Or are you enjoying
the adventure?"
- How did he get it past them?
- Oh, he didnt.
A friend of mine slipped it to me
before the press got hold of it.
He's a flight risk now.
One letter a month, no visitation rights.
- Would you have helped him?
- Of course.
If he had been caught,
the appeal would have been denied.
Bekkie, I may be selfish, but that is the only
hope I have of seeing him out before I die.
Please.
Dont encourage him.
His feelings for you are so strong.
You're right.. so strong, that he could rob
a dozen banks and keep it totally in the dark.
I- I should've seen it.
Oh, Bekkie.
There are parts of Andre
Im afraid welll never know.
You didnt marry him twice.
My friend, Cor.
After two years in here,
I am an honest man.
I no longer worry
that Im living a lie.
I have more respect for the sorted
criminals I find myself amongst...
than I did for the cops
I used to know.
Thugs, bullies, cut-up buggers...
smoking stolen cigars
at my very own wedding.
Robbed goods paid out in the name
of so-called protection.
Id rather rob a bank than accept
a gift that was given out of fear.
Oh, not for me.
Ive got a half shoulder.
- Parachuting accident.
- Right.
How do you spell parachute? Eh?
I don't know.
Hey, asslicker!
Brownnoser!
Im on to you.
- I want to take a trade test.
- Who gives a shit?
On the 31 st.
Outside these walls.
Outside. Really?
Youre soft.
I think youve lost your nerve.
I don't need to prove myself to you.
I was robbing banks years before you.
I robbed my first bank with my finger.
- With your finger?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Really.
You swine.
See, I was born to it.
Chaos...
...its all I know.
Well, Allan, when I get out,
maybe I'll come back and get you.
Thank you, but, uh,
thats not how I see it, Andre.
When I get out,
I'll come back and get you.
- You hear that, McCall?
- What?
- Heyl thinks hell beat us to it.
- Huh?
Scrum up!
Engage!
Oh, God!
Your mother balls!
Fuckindoes cop
broke my fuckinaarm!
Get off!
Get off!
Get up, boys!
Break it up!
Break it up!
Come on, break it up!
Lets check your mobility.
Hey!
Im looking at 30 more years here.
Do you think I care if I live or die?
How about your friend?
Does he care?
Does his wife? His kids?
Come on, give me that!
Give it! You too! Come on!
You, fat boy! Give me the gun!
Lay on the ground!
Move!
Now why don't you be a good ou
and take these off of me.
Now.
Tell me about your cars.
Lee, come on.
You did fine, son.
Just fine.
Is this yours, Granddad?
This yours, is it?
I'll take this.
Nothing more up-to-date?
Get in here!
Thank you for coming.
Pull over! Pull over!
Please step out, Miss.
I didnt know about it!
This way.
- Is there a problem?
- No problem.
I would have gone with them!
Thank you for your cooperation.
Guten tag.
Its Andre.
Hess done it.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.
Do you see that gentleman behind me?
He's my second. Hess here to make sure that
after I leave, you donttt do anything stupid.
Fill it up.
Youre a lovely woman.
Look at that, Lee..
so much work waiting for us!
Well, I take whatever I want to
And, baby, I want you
- ... previously convicted in
a series of bank robberies...
escaped today from custody.
It is suspected that
the precisely executed escape...
was planned by Stander...
with the assistance
of Patrick Lee McCall.
Both men were wearing disguises.
If that is you, Andre, then I trust that
God will help me to do the right thing.
I'll bet they're
pulling out all the stops to find us.
I can tell you what
they're doing right now.
Theyre sitting in a meeting in JoBBurg.
- Smoking fat cigars.
Trying to figure out how to handle this
without making themselves look...
even more witless
than they already are.
Bastards.
Oh, no, you cant be serious.
- Youre next.
- Nah. There's no need.
Cops have got nothing on me.
No photos, nothing.
You lying shit, man.
Lie down!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Allan! Allan!
Outside the walls, Allan.
Trade test is over.
Lets go.
Lee.
Nice to see you.
Whoo-hoo!
Im Peter Grey.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Kenny Roberts.
Brandon Clayton!
Pleasure!
You swine!
Now, where to, my Chinas?
Now what do we do?
We fuck with the system, we crumble its
foundations, and capitalize on the new disorder.
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?
It means we rob every bank between
here and the other side of JoBurg.
Whoo! Whoo!
Sir?
- Its empty.
- Fill it.
Fill it. Quickly.
The banks money or yours?
Help! Anybody help!
Wevejust been robbed!
Careful! They got a gun, eh!
I think it is, eh? Do you- Do you mean
weve been robbed by Andre Stander?
- uh, yes, sir.
- Oh! Hey!
Weve been robbed by Andre Stander, eh!
- Andre Stander! Oh, thats something, eh?
- Yeah. Welll just need you to-
The rent will be collected
on the first of each month.
The water is included
but not the electricity.
- And we expect the house to be kept in a clean condition.
- Of course.
Do you have any references,
Mr. Clayton?
How about 2,000 rand, cash?
The best for my friends.
Tell me, sir,
uh, which side do you dress?
uh, well, I usually just pull
them straight up like that.
Jesus! We look like bank
presidents, not bank robbers!
Then, well need some wheels
to match, eh!
Wait! Stop!
Extremely high-powered, more than capable
of 180, not that Ive tried it personally.
But the Targa is the classic Porsche.
There are only four in the country,
Mr. Marshall- It is Mr. Marshall, isnt it?
This is the only one in this particularly
bright, vibrant color of canary yellow-
- Where the fuck are you going, man?
- Im just going!
Speed, man. Thats how they got you.
You pushed it too far.
If you go fast enough,
You cant see where you've come from.
I just think treating him
like any other criminal wont work.
Any other criminal wasn't
Captain of Detectives.
If we act like were desperate
to apprehend Stander...
- it makes us only look like were scared of him.
- Arentt we?
He's one man.
Werre the damned government.
- Well, now hes three-
- Well, whatever. Bring him in. Quietly.
We are in control here, goddamn it!
As you say, sir.
- Morning, cowboy.
- Youre good at collecting money.
Give us a hand, eh?
Hi.
Come on. Come on.
Move it!
Hey, lady.
Sit down. Back off, huh?
Thank you. Excuse me.
Fill her up.
- Oh!
- Thats good. Zip it up. Zip it up. Okay. Very good.
Do they pay you much?
Twenty seconds.
Took 7,000 in cash.
But I knew all about
their other robberies, so-
Theres 25,000 rand in there.
A downtown bank manager
has reported that due to his foresight...
- the gang missed a substantial sum hidden in a secondary safe.
- Oh!
- Allan.
- Its 52 degrees on the Reef.
In case you have a short memory,
this is a fucking robbery.
Three banks were robbed
in the Johannesburg area today.
One of them, twice.
Andre Stander, the mastermind,
brazenly returned to the bank...
and allegedly robbed
a second set of its contents.
Peace in Lebanon is up for debate
as the U.S. and France-
It must be hard on you, boss?
Yeah. It is.
Very kind of you to ask, Harold.
The latest on the Stander gang...
is that Andre Stander look-a-like,
Mr. Mark Jennings...
has been arrested for the third time.
Mr. Jennings spoke to our reporter today
upon his release.
I cant walk in the streets,
I cantt do my business.
Ive been arrested three times as a Stander
and not one apology. Not one!
Just this morning-
Oh, poor bugger.
His 15 minutes used up.
Its enough to drive anybody crazy.
Do you fancy going out
and stealing a car?
Hey! Hey, Andre! Andre! Shes cool!
She's my woman! I love her!
Every time you fuck
You fall in love!
You understand.
Youre one of us now.
You fuck up, you give us to the cops,
Youre dead!
Like that.
That was nice.
Shell turn on us,
shelll turn on him...
the first time shes pushed.
Hey, don't take any notice of him, huh?
He's just jealous
ccause yourrre my chickie, eh?
Come here, my little Talia.
Dont worry. Come on.
Tarzan take you back to bed now.
Huh?
Ive been in twice. She's seen me too much.
You do this one, you two.
She has a lot of firepower
at her fingertips, Andre.
Itll be easy. Lee,you distract her.
Send her to the back for Beretta rifles. Allan,
hop over the counter, ready for her return.
Dont worry, Allan. I'll protect you.
- May I help you?
- Do you have any Beretta rifles?
uh,yes. Yes, we do.
Would you like the deluxe or standard?
Right. And so, whats the difference?
Well, the deluxe is checkered,
the standard isnt.
- Checkered meaning?
- Its like an engraving.
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.
Well, I think then, uh, probably
the deluxe is what Im looking for.
- All right. Let me just check the back for you.
- Right. Great, thank you.
Fuck! Its glass.
Hop over the counter. Fuck!
Its in the fucking details, Andre.
What are you laughing at?
Your pants are too tight.
Oh, shit!
Easy. Easy. Easy.
What-
She had a gun, man! Why has she-
Why has she got a gun, huh?
Just the heavy metal, Allan.
Right.
Lets go!
".. says Captain
Cor Van Deventer.
He took an arsenal- enough to blast
a hole through the middle of this country. "
I cant believe the first time
I shoot somebody, I shoot a woman.
"Fear the Stander Gang. "
Gang? Thats crass. cool.
"... are planning a new series of robberies,
this time with deadly force. "
- What other kind is there?
- "Victim identified the shooter as escaped convict Lee McCall. "
- Oh, fuck!
- Shes well enough to I.D. you.
- I wish Id killed the bitch.
- "Police have set up a special task force. "
Gentlemen, we have
graduated to task force.
"A nerve center in Yoeville- "
I know this building.
And you know
whats right next door?
Thats completely outrageous.
Whats so fucking funny?
- They think scared,
so they think well lie low.
Fuck predictable.
Lets do it.
Shit!
Leave it, Lee.
Isnt that the-the-
the bank robbers?
Hey! What are you doing?
- Lee!
- Get out of the car now!
Lee! Lee! Lee!
He's cool. Hess cool.
This is crazy. This is fuckin crazy.
I mean, what the fuck are we doing, huh?
I mean, were riskin our necks
when they know we are coming...
and you're giving
the fuckin money away.
- I mean, whats the point, eh?
What's the fuckin point- - Shut up.
Take it easy, relax. Its cool.
Take your time. Smile.
Dont turn around.
Dontt look at your coworkers.
Very good.
Just keep filling the bag.
Lee.
What the fuck, Lee?
We said no fucking shooting, eh?
We said no shooting!
- Fuck!
- Just drive!
Shit for brains!
Gun!
What the fuck?
He's out of his mind.
I cant do it.
I'm not going to make it.
- Relax.
- Fuck him.
Theyre so busy investigating
the last three, they're stretched thin.
Fuck you. Fuck you!
I don't need to set a bank robbing record.
Leave him in the van next time. Fuck him.
- Lee.
- Dont need him.
Lee.
This is supposed to be fun, huh?
You know its not often that
houses like this come on the market.
He cant be serious!
In our top story,
police have deployed extra officers...
at bank branches in the wake
of five bank robberies, all last Friday...
attributed to the Stander Gang.
- Heres what you had to say.
- You know, uh...
hes just doing what a lot
of people wish they could do.
He's got nerve.
I'll give him that.
How about some
personal credit here?
- They even repeat the same bank.
- Well announce ourselves as the Heyl Gang next time.
That would be very nice, Andre.
And they have courage.
And I think hes really inventive.
Youre obviously not the only ones
who enjoy seeing the tables turn, eh?
The Premier of the Soviet union has died.
Right, Allan.
Thats why werre bigger news
than the head of fucking Russia.
Jesus! You scared the shit out of me.
Sorry about that.
I had to make sure we were alone.
Its different now.
- Im different.
- So I've read. Always different, never the same.
- Whats changed, Andre?
- Money.
Money solves a lot of problems, Bekkie.
Got plenty of that.
We can go anywhere.
- Anywhere in the world.
- Anywhere but here, right?
- What about my life? What about my freedom?
- Freedom?
Theres no freedom here.
Theres two choices-
either become them...
or you live at odds
with everything around you.
I don't want that for you.
Welll start over.
America. New I.D.
Your dreams can come true.
- I'll make them happen.
- Well, thatss very glamorous, Andre.
But unlike you, I look terrible
in a black wig and glasses.
Im quite fine, thank you very much,
in my quiet little life.
I want to take you with me.
I promised, remember?
- Dont start.
- Yourre everything to me. All Ivvve ever wanted.
I had everything I wanted.
Everything.
Bekk. The things they say about me-
Im not stupid, Andre.
There's not a thinking man among us...
that doesnt want to blow this place
to smithereens from time to time.
But we don't.
We find other ways.
I wont make it without you.
- I need to be left alone.
- Oh,Jesus!
You love me.
We would be together.
I know how this will end.
Lauderdale...
the beach.
Remember?
You come with me.
Im tired, Andre.
Some things are done
that cant be undone.
I hate you.
Are you coming to work today, Lee?
- Huh?
- I said, "Are you coming to work today?"
- Morning all.
- How is it?
- Morning.
- Would you like some eggs?
Ja. Ja.
Its been a long time since
I've had a home-cooked meal.
Im glad you like it.
You wouldnt have
any dust over there, would you, Shar?
- Andre.
- Lee.
I know Shars not your kind of woman,
but she's the kind I dreamed of, right.
Dream come true.
Im happy for you.
You have plans?
We should all have plans.
In fact, Im thinking of making
a change myself. With my lady.
Maybe the States.
Lauderdale.
Try something different.
Thats great, man.
What about you, Allan?
Me? uh-
Id like to go to Greece.
Well, we got plenty of money.
I mean, enough to last for a while.
Get all the airline schedules.
Well plan it.
Between 3:00 and 5:00 on Sunday...
two S.A.A. 747 s, B.A...
K.L.M., Air France...
Lufthansa- all coming in.
Were already in, Andre.
We want to go out.
El Al to Tel Aviv 32 minutes later.
Youll be on it. A Hasidic Rabbi on the
way to a Talmud seminar with his niece.
Or a wrestling coach
on his way to a match in Melbourne.
Shar, make us some tea, will ya?
Okay.
Enough to live good for a while.
Why not forever?
Rip off the fucking airport.
Aw, fuckin hell.
You sly-
I might have known.
- Weve written a pretty good story so far.
- Are you joking?
Why not a perfect ending?
- Jesus fuckin Christ.
- Standerss last stand, eh?
I think its fucking great.
Thats fuckin great, yeah.
Pounds, marks, dollars.
You can go anywhere in the world.
- Anywhere in the world.
- Right.
Yeah. Okay. Right.
Vienna, my boy.
Spilled my champagne, huh?
To you and to me.
And to your lovely little breasts.
- Lets swim. Come on.
- Swim?
Swim. Swim.
Youre warm. Look at you go,
and your pineapple chunks.
Trying to drown me, huh?
Right.
Give me my champagne.
And don't drown me.
What do you want?
A few years ago-
His name-
Mnguni.
Robert.
Im looking for his family.
Themba Mnguni.
Themba Mnguni?
Themba!
Yeah.
Fuck him and fuck you too!
I was fuckin ready, huh!
And he fuckin blows it!
We were outta here!
- You didnt want to do it anyway.
- Fuck!
On the crime front, a report just in...
advised that police have thwarted
an alleged Stander Gang plan...
to commit a robbery
at the international airport.
- Police under the command of
Cor Van Deventer- - Amazing.
They would have had us.
Even when hes wrong, hess right.
- Stander himself was spotted
outside the airport terminal.
Give me that gun.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God!
- Face it. You were wrong!
- Hell try it again. I know him.
That bastard is still running you.
He's running the goddamn force!
He has made us look
impotent in our own country.
What does this tell
our enemies within?
We want him stopped, Captain.
Shot if necessary.
Shot on sight.
I understand.
Hello?
Im sorry.
I've let you all down.
Youll have to go without me.
Never give up, do you? Eh?
I'll come soon.
Im not going.
Youll find a way.
You always do.
I think I have the way.
Shes a 55-foot steel ketch.
Perkins diesels.
Solar panel.
Long range fuel tank.
Shes got a range, under power...
of about a thousand nautical miles.
All the best equipment.
I used to have a water bed,
but the rolling got a bit much.
I could recommend a good chef.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Shes valued at £ 148,000.
Who was the Lily Rose?
A wife. Considered bad luck
to change the name of a boat...
even when you change your woman.
Shell go with the boat, all right.
But thats her negotiation.
Now then, what did you have in mind?
No waiting for the check
to clear then, is there?
Right!
Fucking genius, eh!
The high seas!
Madam, you better come with me.
Hold out on me...
and I swear I will charge you
as a member of the Stander Gang.
I can make your life hell.
He knew the money was bent.
Everyones dishonest.
Just a matter of degree.
He would have taken less.
Why hit the man when hes down?
It would bring us bad karma
in our new life.
Had enough of that in my old one.
You know what got me
started on all of this?
Are you saying it wasn't greed, Allan?
It was a girl.
A black girl.
She wasn't mine, but...
I loved her.
I really loved her.
I was a student
at teacher-training college.
I was full of politics, full of hope.
She was pregnant, not by me.
I shouldn't have been with her.
But the fucking cops-
They came into where we were.
They saw us together.
They beat us.
They beat the baby out of her.
So I robbed a store to get
her money to go to England.
And it was easy.
Too easy.
Taking down those banks...
fucking with those bastards.
Thanks.
The girl on the boat-
You think he was serious about her?
Lees got Shar.
Youvve got yours.
She is coming, isnt she?
Shes always with me.
Always will be.
One place I fucked up, my bro.
Hey, give it another go.
You've got a way now. Itss different.
Thank you. Move along.
Thank you. Come on.
Shar?
Shar?
This is the South African police force!
You are surrounded!
Put your hands in the air,
and stay where you are!
Dont make any sudden move!
Stay calm.
Stay calm. Move along.
You cannot escape.
You are surrounded!
Go on. Go on.
Thank you. Keep moving.
Andre!
Come out with your hands in the air!
You are surrounded.
There is no chance to escape!
Went out okay. Like Butch Cassidy.
- Like Bonnie and Clyde.
- Doesn't matter much. Out is out.
Move along! Get all these cars out.
Move along! Move along!
What do we do now?
Head back to the boat?
They've got the mansion.
Then they get the phone record.
They'll make us in Cape Town.
Hit it, Allan.
All vehicles in the Johannesburg area...
be on the lookout for
a yellow 1983 Porsche Targa.
License number-
Shit.
You think they'll catch us?
- Speed of light, Andre.
- Try the speed of darkness.
- Are you out of your fuckin-
- Your car.
Good.
Hell, take mine.
Better stop the car now.
Fucking bastards.
All those guns to take out Lee.
It was me who did this to him.
I should've left him in jail.
Ah, fuck that.
You gave him the best time of his life.
The last six months, he was somebody.
Eh?
The wrong ones do keep dying.
I, uh-
I had a brother.
But, uh, you two-
probably as close
as anyone to knowing me.
You wont make it with me.
Weve got this far, all right?
Well get another boat.
Cant fool me, Allan.
Cant fool yourself.
Hey.
I'll see you in hell, bro.
Go.
Hello?
Is this Mrs. Mark Jennings?
- Yes. Can I help you?
Im calling from
the office of the high court.
Weve managed to accelerate the review
of your husbandss case.
So well be sending an officer this very
afternoon to collect his documents...
- for the preparation of the trial.
- Okay.
In the case
of false arrest or mistaken identity...
- the court requires passport...
- Passport.
- book of life...
- Yes.
birth certificate
and a fourth photo I.D.
- All right.
- All of which will be returned following the trial.
- These are mine.
- This is yours.
Thank you. And thats
everything in there.
If you need an envelope-
Keep that someplace safe.
- Thanks very much.
- My pleasure.
Bye-bye.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- I was hoping for-
Andre Stander!
Not again.
I am reaching for my wallet!
I am already suing
the Johannesburg police...
and several of their officers
personally for false arrest.
And if you don't remove
that weapon from my face, sir...
I'll bring a charge of assault
against you as well.
Its a sad state of affairs when a man has to
carry a library to keep from being arrested.
- Sir. He's been sighted.
- Where?
- At the airport.
- Come on. Lets go!
Look, either use force to arrest me...
or let me get on with my life.
Sorry, sir.
Sir, false alarm.
Wrong man.
No worries.
I'll catch you later, huh?
Thank you.
Sorry, sir.
Police! Keep it clear!
No, no, no! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Police!
- Its gone!
- Hold on! Hold on!
Its gone.
And he was taken from Africa
All right, party people.
This is the spring break
You've been waiting for.
Lauderdale is going off!
Said he was a buffalo soldier
Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo soldier
In the heart of America
Are you him?
Pardon?
That guy.
You know.
Im sorry.
You don't sound like him.
That guy, you know.
On the TV show, the detective.
Oh, God. um-
Hutch. You know?
Im afraid I dontt.
- So then, like, what are you, English?
- Sure.
Wow. He solves crimes, Hutch..
with Starsky.
And if he commits them?
Well, what kind of a TV show
would that make?
Youre cute when you laugh.
Hey, Cheryl!
Sigma Phis having a blowout at the motel!
- Free beer!
- Oh, my God! I am so there!
A call for you, boss.

Please get out of your automobile.
Sir, please get out of your automobile.
Get out of the car

Stand against the door with your hands

Against the car, sir!

Shots fired!
We need paramedics.
10-4, unit 14. All units respond.
Stand by, 14.
Theyre on their way. Over.
I got a letter from
the government the other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me
for their army or whatever
Picture me givina damn
I said never
Here is a land
that never gave a damn
About a brother like myself
Cause I aintt never did
I wasnttt with it
But just that very minute
it occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin
as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been
They got me sittinin the state pen
I gotta get out
but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan
on the cell floor
Im not a fugitive
on the run
But a brother like me
begun to be another one
Public enemy servintime
They drew the line,yaall
They criticize me
for some crime
I got a letter
I got a letter
I got a letter
Picture me givina damn
I said never
