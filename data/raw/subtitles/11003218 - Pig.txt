Come on.
There you go.
Come on.
Have a truffle, girl.
Good find, girl.
Oh, boy.
Excuse me.
No. No, fuck off.
Get away from my car.
Go, go. Come on.
No, no, not me, either.
What's up, old man?
Oh, wow.
Beautiful.
Woo.
I don't know how this
little fucker does it.
How do you do it?
You sure you don't want
one of those,
um, camp showers,
you know,
the ones with the propane
and the hot water?
What about that phone?
I don't wanna be
the one to drive up
and find you, like dead.
You know, there's, like,
animals and shit out here.
Okay.
Oh.
Good talk, Rob.
See you next Thursday, asshole.
Go out.
Go out, go away.
Get out, get out, it's just...
I'm trying to surprise you.
I'm trying... I'm...
I'm okay.
It's just coyotes.
Back to bed, girl.
Hey, hey.
It's just coyotes.
That's it, go to bed.
Go inside! Go!
Get it. Get it!
I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Let her go!
- Oh, my God!
Hey!
No. No. No.
Can I help you?
Is...
Marge here?
Marge died 10 years ago.
Oh.
Do you have a phone?
Are you gonna order something?
No.
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.
Thank you.
You fucker.
Whoa, that hurt?
Listen, man.
You know this isn't, like,
my problem, right?
You want your supply,
I need my pig.
The classical composers
are those of the first rank
who have developed music
to the highest
picture-perfection
on its formal side.
Therefore,
where classical music
proves superior
to all other forms
is in its staying power.
It was beautiful 200 years ago
and will remain beautiful
200 years from now.
Something so potent
and elemental in the appeal...
How's it going, Mac?
- Yo.
- Mac?
You know, I don't like
buyers coming out to the site.
Yeah, hey, Mac. Sorry.
I'm just, um...
um, uh, we're just looking
for that couple
with the green pickup.
Turquoise.
You got a little somethin'.
Uh, they haven't been around
for a few weeks.
What'd they do?
Nothing.
Just a little misunderstanding
we gotta get sorted out.
They took my pig.
What kind of pig?
It's a truffle pig.
Motherfucker!
Wicky, you take over.
Anyone fucks with Wicky,
I'll break your fingers.
Motherfuckers!
I expect certain things
from the people
I do business with.
I think that's reasonable.
Yeah. We appreciate that, Mac.
- We really do appreciate it.
- Uh-hmm.
You've been digging my sites.
No. No, no, no.
We wouldn't do that.
This guy comes telling me
you took his pig.
That means you're poaching.
Okay. Listen.
We don't even have
the pig anymore, okay?
- I mean, I swear...
- Who has it?
I don't know.
Did you see him?
I didn't get like
a fucking ID or...
it was just some guy
with money and...
- Rich?
- Um, he came to us.
Oh, he drove a nice car.
What kind of car
did he drive in?
Black.
It was... it was waxy.
It was just some city guy.
I don't... I don't know.
So I guess that's it?
Just find a new one?
Another pig can't do
what she did.
I don't know, man. Get a...
get a good trainer
or something.
You lose a season
while I train a pig
that'll never be as good?
Take me to the city.
What?
A city guy.
What are you gonna do,
knock on every
fuckin' door in Portland?
I might know someone
who knows the industry.
You might...
I... I'm not taking you
to the fucking city, okay?
That's where I do my business.
Are you afraid?
Listen, what I do
is all about my reputation.
- People talk.
- People talk?
- Yeah.
- People talk.
Stop saying that.
You like this car?
You like that shirt?
Shut up.
Yo.
Is this the spot?
I need $10.
Sure you do.

Have you heard anything
about a pig?
I remember a time
when your name
meant something
to people, Robin.
But now...
you have no value.
You don't even exist anymore.
You don't exist.
You even know his real name?
Open the door.
How do you know that guy?
Rob, how do you know him?
I used to live around here.
Was that Edgar?
How do you know Edgar?
What time is it?
- What?
- I don't have a watch.
Oh, shocker.
It's 9:15.
What are we doing?
We're waiting until 12:00.
Oh, shit!
Just you... yeah, you go.
Go away.
I need to go inside.
We don't have a bathroom.
- I'm having a night out...
- Don't tell him my name,
- ...with my friend.
- You stupid asshole.
- What is it?
- Amir?
- Fucking kill me...
- Amir! Yo!
Dave? What's up, my dude?
I didn't know
you were working tonight.
Yeah. Is this guy with you?
Hey, listen,
he's my dad's friend.
I'm just showing him around
and we're just...
- Just whatever, man.
- He's Buddhist.
I don't care.
Do you even know
where we're going?
Rob!
We're going
to the Hotel Portland.
What?
What hotel? What...
The Hotel Portland.
I know this city.
There is no such thing
as a Hotel Portland.
I'm sticking my neck out.
And we're in my city now,
so you have to...
you know,
you gotta keep me in the loop.
There is no loop.
We're finding my pig.
You're not part of a loop.
You're my ride.
Fuck you, man!
You're just a fucking
homeless asshole
who probably fucks his pig.
I'm so sick of your shit!
Do you know what you're worth
to me without that pig?
Nothing. Fucking zero!
You're gonna have
a fucking stroke in that cabin,
and I'm gonna be the only one
that fucking notices.
So how about try and give me
some fucking respect?
I don't fuck my pig.
Fuck this, man!
I am fucking outta here.
The hotel was torn down
back in the '50s.
Now it's Pioneer Square.
But they just covered up
the subbasement, so...
it's all still there
under the park.
- What?
- Now it's Edgar's place.
That's where we're going.
Now you're in the loop.
Help me.
Whatever happens,
just stay back.
What does that mean?
What's "whatever?"
Rob?
It's dusty.
Leave that off.
Your eyes will adjust.
Edgar's been running fights
for restaurant workers
for 30 years.
If your name means something,
they'll bid high.
That's all he sees.
How do you know that?
Who are you?
Ten seconds.
That is 500 bucks for Dennis.
And next up, we've got...
Oh, my God.

♪ We're in the garden ♪
I'm looking...
for my pig.
Sorry.
I don't cook very much.
You know the place?
Finway's?
Yeah, it's hot.
Can you get a reservation
for lunch?
Sure. Yeah.
You know, when I was a kid,
my parents used to do this...
date night thing.
I mean, not a lot,
my dad was really busy.
They'd usually come back
fighting and screaming
at each other.
And my mom would get all...
mopey.
But...
this one night...
I remember...
going to this restaurant and...
they came back,
and they were so happy.
Like, they were smiling
and talking about the food
and the wine
and really, really,
really drunk.
They talked about that meal
for years.
Even after the chef,
this huge chef,
just disappeared.
That was your spot.
People still talk about it,
you know?
It's probably the only time
I remember my mom, like...
What happened to her?
She's...
Um, she killed herself.
She was...
she was never like...
when you're like that,
it's just it's gonna happen
sooner or later.
My dad was...
he was always the tough one
in the family.
So, his business is bomb.
I mean, he's not going anywhere
anytime soon.
He's very...
he's very with it,
know what I mean?
He's locked in.
Motherfucker.
We don't...
have to care.
People first came out here
10,000 years ago...
we would've been
under 400 feet of water.
Every 200 years,
we get an earthquake,
right along the coast.
One's coming up.
When the shockwave hits,
most of the city will flatten.
Every bridge will fall
into the Willamette,
so...
there's nowhere to go
even if we could.
Anyone who survives
that's just waiting.
Five minutes later,
they'll look up
and they'll see a wave
ten stories high.
And then all this, everyone...
it's all gonna be at the bottom
of the ocean.
Again.
You should use stale bread
for French toast.
A tone becomes
musical material
only by association
with another tone.
We might hear it alone,
study its quality,
and determine its degree
of acuteness or gravity,
but its...
You want that hundred fifty
percent carthusianum?
You come to me.
If you want
some bullshit indicum,
then you go to Katie.
You want some shit
that's been sitting in a...
you want some shit
that's been sitting in a cooler
for three days?
Then you go to my father.
But if you want the real thing,
if you want the real thing
then you come to me.
I'm the king of the jungle.
Hey, you're buddies
with the sous-chef
- over at Finway's, right?
- How many grams are we at?
Uh, 220.
- That's close enough.
- Cool. So, um...
Hey, Jess will get you
on the way out, all right?
Right. Awesome. Um...
you are friends
with Finway's guy, right?
- Yeah.
- Sweet. Sweet.
Yo, you think you could, like,
score me a res
for lunch today or...
You know that's your dad's spot.
Yeah. No, I... I mean, I know.
It's just like... it's fine.
He knows. It's cool.
I'm not there for business.
I'm just...
I have a friend in town.
Anyway, you know how busy
they are this time of year?
For sure.
For sure. But...
I mean, you got
like mad ins there, so.
Come on.
Hey.
Half off.
No.
My friend is Robin Feld.
That sounds nice.
What is it?
It's called a handpan.
Wanna try it?
Does your face hurt?
Yeah.
Thanks.
What's your name?
I'm Rob.
I used to live here.
What happened
to the persimmon tree?
What's a persimmon?
It's a, uh...
it's an orange fruit.
Looks kind of like a tomato.
You... you can't eat it
if it's not ripe.
It's awful.
But...
if you give it time,
it gets rid of these things
called tannins,
and then they're very good.
I don't think
we have a persimmon tree.
No?
That's okay.
Did it die?
We all have
a set of held beliefs
about the world around us.
To challenge them
is to acknowledge
our foundation is sand,
but it opens us up
to something greater.
To pure connection.
To true life.
Today's journey begins
by uniting the depths of the sea
with the riches of our forests.
We've emulsified
locally sourced scallops
encased in a flash-frozen
seawater roe blend,
on a bed of foraged
huckleberry foam,
all bathed in the smoke
from Douglas fir cones.
I'd like to speak to the chef.
Listen, man, can we try
to keep a low profile?
My dad sells to this place.
I'm not really
supposed to be in here.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Why?
Why what?
Why aren't you
supposed to be in here?
Oh, that's nice.
You know, we just have a thing.
We don't step
on each other's sales.
I've got my business
and he's got his.
Why don't you work for him?
I will one day, you know,
when I'm more established.
Your dad sounds terrible.
Well, you know,
can't all live in the woods.
I mean, it sounds like
he's not very supportive.
Well, he knows
that I can make it on my own.
You know, in this business,
you got to...
You got to...
you know, I don't need help.
I don't need his help.
Let me do the talking, okay?
- Okay.
- Hi, I'm Chef Finway.
Welcome to Eurydice.
- Food is really good.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
I'm so glad you're enjoying it.
Um, we heard there were some
new truffles on the menu?
Well, we are planning
a few truffle dishes
for the winter menu.
It's... it's a...
it's a fascinating
and expanding local industry
with deep roots
in old-world, uh, traditions.
Great.
Um...
I'm looking for a truffle pig.
I don't...
I, uh, I don't understand.
I just wanna know about the pig.
Tell him who you are.
Come on. Tell him.
Chef Feld?
Oh, my God. Uh, may I?
Uh, how are you?
My God. You... you... you've been
off the scene for what,
- uh, 10 years?
- Fifteen.
Really? Okay.
I thought you were...
um, well, I mean,
- the time is very, uh...
- Sure.
Yeah.
I'm sorry,
do you need medical attention?
No. Thank you.
Uh, you probably
don't remember me,
but I actually worked at Hestia.
You were a prep cook
for two months.
Was it two months?
I fired you because
you always overcooked the pasta.
Ah, ah, now, this is excellent.
This is a, uh, a 2012 Pinot
from just 20 miles away.
So do you know about the pig?
Uh, why... why do you want a pig?
It's my pig.
Oh, okay.
Uh, that... that... that's great.
That's a... that's a...
that's a great business.
It's a... it's a...
it's an expanding industry.
- It's... it's...
- Someone stole it.
I really, um,
I respect you, Chef,
I always have.
But I'm running a business here
and people have expectations,
uh, critics,
uh, investors, so forth.
And, uh, truffles
are-are-are-are a key part
of the whole, uh, concept
of the winter menu
and... and they need to be
the top of the line.
So you understand.
I... I have... I have
the utmost respect for you,
utmost.
What is the...
concept here?
Um, well, uh,
we're interested
in taking local ingredients,
uh, native to this region
and... and just
deconstructing them,
you know, making
the... the familiar feel foreign,
thereby giving us, uh,
an even greater appreciation
of food as a whole.
This is the kind
of cooking you like?
It's cutting-edge,
- it's very exciting.
- Exciting.
Uh, I mean, everybody loves it.
You like cooking it?
- Absolutely.
- Derek,
what was it you always
used to talk about opening?
Wasn't it a pub?
Every-everyone loves it here.
It's a... this is a huge success.
Why didn't you open your pub?
I... I don't...
I don't know that
I... I really wanted,
uh, I mean... I mean, it's such...
that was such a long time ago.
When I fired you, I asked you
what you wanted to do.
You said you have
a few rooms upstairs,
a real English pub.
That... did I... I say that?
- Yes.
- Nobody wants pubs around here.
It's a... that's-that's-that's
a terrible investment.
What was going to be
your signature dish?
Liver scotch eggs
with a honey curry mustard.
They're not real.
You get that, right?
None of it is real.
The critics aren't real,
the customers aren't real
because this isn't real.
You aren't real.
What...
Okay.
Derek, why do you care
about this people?
They don't care about you,
none of them.
They don't even know you
because you haven't shown them.
Every day you wake up
and there'll be less of you.
You live your life for them
and they don't even see you.
You don't even see yourself.
We don't get a lot of things
to really care about.
Derek, who has my pig?
He's not somebody
you wanna make angry.
He will be angry.
Rob.
Rob, it wasn't me, okay?
I don't even talk to him.
Open it.
Rob, I didn't say shit, okay?
Please,
I... I didn't even know about it.
Take me to him.
It's my dad, okay?
It's my dad.
You don't understand.
No.
Fuck. Stop.
Stop.
What the fuck?
The Camaro.
What the fuck?
The Camaro. Stop.
- You psycho.
- What's his address?
Listen, man,
I will get you a new one.
I will get you a new one.
I swear.
I'll take a hit for the season.
What is it?
380 Northwest Willow.
We're done.
I don't wanna see you again.
So that's it?
Really?
I'm right here.
Man, I am right here.
We can work this out.
Okay. You know what? Fuck.
All great men
are ahead of their time
and then all great music,
no matter when written,
you shall find
the instances of...
Hi, Mom.
Um, I met the guy
who, um...
who made you that dinner.
Do you remember that dinner?
I actually think
you'd really like him.
Maybe not.
I don't know.
Would you wish
Dad would just let you die?
So do you just wish
that he'd let you die?
Excuse me.
Um, I was gonna clean
her trach but...
- Uh-hmm.
- ...did you wanna see her?
No.
Can I say...
it's an honor meeting you?
Half the restaurants in Portland
owe you a debt.
I'd like my pig back.
My son means well, but, uh,
he's not cut out
for this business.
It'll eat him alive.
I mean, he'll be okay.
I'll find him a nice desk job,
something out of the way.
That's really where he belongs.
I don't care.
You know, he, uh,
he told me the first day
that he met you
was actually sweet.
And I didn't think the business
would take off, but...
here I am with egg on my face.
But I think now it's time
for somebody who knows
what they're doing to take over.
I want my pig back.
Yeah. I'll give you $15,000
to walk away.
- No.
- Twenty thousand.
- No.
- Twenty million?
I control myself very well,
but I don't think
you understand what I am.
From the very first moment
my son started selling for you,
you've been in my world.
This whole time,
all these years,
Edgar, Finway,
those tweaked out fucks,
they're mine.
That's just how it is.
You have nothing
to bargain with.
Now I will have
$25,000 delivered
to that little campground
of yours tomorrow.
If I see you again,
you do anything to fuck with me,
I will chop that pig up
into bacon.
I can buy another one.
Now get out of my house.
Were you always like this...
or was it just after she died?
Were you?
You made the right choice
being out there in the woods.
You had your moment,
but there's nothing here
for you anymore.
There's really nothing here
for most of us.
You don't keep a grip on it,
that's pretty much it.
Buy yourself a new pig.
I thought
you might need your ride.
I have a bike.
I'm sorry I told him about you.
I really didn't know
he'd take her.
I don't need my pig
to find truffles.
What?
The trees.
The trees tell you
where to look.
Then why the fuck
did we do all this?
I love her.
Do you have a pen?
What?
I have to write something.
Um...
well, if the city floods,
we can always go up
to Mount Hood.
Hood's an active volcano.
Well, I'm not fucking
moving to Seattle.
Fuck Seattle.
I'm gonna need you
to drop me off
and go and get everything
on that list.
I can't get all these stuff.
Check in with the names.
Tell them you're with me.
You want me to use your name?
Should I even ask
what we're doing?
We're getting my pig back.
Can I help you?
Hi. Um, I'm looking for Jezebel.
You'll have to schedule
an appointment.
Robin Feld sent me.
Are these all yours?
Well, now, yes.
They used to belong
to Robin and Laurie.
Who's Laurie?
He didn't ask me to
but I'm saving
the one next to it for him.
You tell him that, okay?
You made it a bakery?
I'm a baker.
I kept it the same
for a couple years.
I thought maybe you'd come
take it back...
but you didn't.
And, um, it wasn't me,
you're a chef,
I'm a baker.
Do you still make
your salted baguette?
Robin...
I do still make it.
The same recipe?
Same recipe.
Do you have a loaf?
Can I have another?
Bye, chef.
You got rid of the curtains?
Laurie always wanted to.
This is better.
Dad?
Dad, can you come out here?
We made you dinner.
You can leave.
We made you dinner.
Thank you.
Your son found this.
Hmm.
Get out.
Please get out.
Get out!
Get out of my house!
Get out!
I remember every meal
I ever cooked.
I remember every person
I ever served.
Why are you doing this?
I'm sorry.
But, um...
by the time I got it,
these waste of space junkies,
they...
They were too rough,
we couldn't...
she died.
What can I get you two?
What pie do you have today?
We don't do pie.
You don't do pie?
We have chocolate chip cookies,
cheesecake, and brownies.
All right.
We'll get two brownies.
We'll have some coffee too.
Cream and sugar?
Sure.
What are you thinking?
I was thinking
if I never came looking for her,
in my head,
she'd still be alive.
But she wouldn't be.
No, she wouldn't.
You okay?
I think I'm gonna walk.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'll see you Thursday?
Yeah.
...shall not be
difficult for him to recognize
the three elements
on which music rests,
melody, harmony, and rhythm.
Can he recognize them
with sufficient...
Hey, no.
Stop.
So I know we're going
to a really fancy restaurant
tonight
and you're gonna complain
about the food,
and I'm gonna have
to get really drunk
to deal with it.
But it's your birthday
and I love you.
This song reminds me of you.
