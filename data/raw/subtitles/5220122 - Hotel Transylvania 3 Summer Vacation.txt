Budapest, Budapest,
the next stop, Budapest.
Budapest is the next stop.
Budapest.
- Tickets, ladies.
- Ooh, here you go.
- Here's mine.
- And mine.
- Mine too.
- Here you go.
And, thank you, young man.
Man, I hate wearing disguises.
This heels are killing me.
Okay, take it down a notch,
we don't want to alarm the humans.
Psst, Drac.
I'm about to freak out!
- You're a nice kitty.
- I'm good kitty cat. Meow, meow.
Oh, no, not this clown again.
Good evening, travelers,
I am professor Abraham Van Helsing. Yes.
One of the Van Helsing's.
For centuries, my families protected
humanity from the evils of monsters.
So, you can believe me
when I tell you
there are monsters hiding
amongst you!
But fear not,
for I am a professional.
And I know
how to flush out this beast.
- And bring them into the light!
- Fire, Bad!
Sorry, guys.
Finally, first I kill Dracula,
and then the rest of the monsters!
Why do you keep doing this? Your dad,
your grandfather, your great-great-granny.
I defeated them all.
When will you Van Helsing's
ever learn to let go of the hate?
Never! Because you monsters
are evoked!
- Eh, squeak, squeak?
- Huh, A mouse?
You can't run from me, Prince of Darkness!
I will hunt you for all eternity.
I swear, I will never rest
until I destroy you!
And... Every... Other... Monsters...
If it's the last thing... I... Ever... Ahhh!
Boy, that guy is annoying.
Maybe one day there will be a place where
the monsters can go, to get away from it all.
Take a vacation, who knows? Maybe even
get married. Wouldn't that be something?
Shh, okay. Shh, shh.
When is this thing starting?
Oh, you made them cry, Wayne.
- Oh, Except this little one.
- That's Sunny, she doesn't cry.
- Ow!
- She bites.
This is a very
special moment, Carl.
Any second, your beautiful bride
is going to walk right down the aisle.
Oh no, Drac. She's not coming.
Oh, don't worry. Mavis is with her.
I'm sure everything is under control.
Mavie, is everything under control?
Um... yup, just a slight case
of pre-wedding jitters.
Yup, everything is fine.
Please, try to relax, Lucy.
I've taken care of everything.
The wedding is going to be perfect.
It's not that. Just... how do I know
I'm doing the right thing?
I know just how you feel.
The day I married Johnny
was the best day of my life, but...
- ...I was so nervous.
- Not as nervous as I was.
And you should have seen my dad,
he was a mess.
I wouldn't get out
of my coffin that night.
But he knew
it was meant to be.
It doesn't matter where you come from,
or how different you are.
A zing only happens
once in your life.
And you have to cherish it.
You're right! Thank you!
All right, okay.
Oh, okay.
I do.
I do.
- Do you hear that?
- Yes, I thought we locked him in his room.
We did!
- Hi, mom. Hi, papa!
- Dennis!
Tinkles was great,
so we let him out.
Tinkles, sit!
Ugh, whose idea was it
to let Dennis have a pup?
- Umm, yours?
- Okay. Eh...
Eh... Right.
- Poor Tinkles.
- Dennis?
Look, honey,
I know you love Tinkles,
but we're not allowed to bring our dogs...
Uh... uh, I mean our pets everywhere.
- Okay?
- Okay.
DJ Jessy Johnny in the house.
It's time to welcome
the happy couple.
Mr. and Mrs. Prickles!
The bride and groom, invite everyone
to join them on the dance floor.
Care to dance?
- Is that her?
- Ooh, watch out now.
She got stitches
in all the right places.
Okay, there's no way that
is related to you, Frank.
Well, she's my
right arm's cousin.
- Oh!
- Ah, I see it now.
Frank wanted me to meet you.
We're arm new cousins.
Twice he moved.
Ah, of course, eh...
I don't recognize that bicep anyway.
He thought since we're both single,
we might hit it off. Maybe go on a date?
Date? Oh, well, eh...
It's just that, eh...
Whoa, DJ's booth
is a sacred space!
Oh! I love this song!
Do you want to dance? Dracula?
Oh, where'd he go?
Dracula! Dracula!
What's the matter, Dracula?
Don't like her?
No offense, but you can't be
too picky.
You haven't had a date
in 100 years.
Look, guys. I appreciate your concerns,
but it's... It's not up to me.
You only zing once, and I did.
Times have changed, buddy.
You can even find someone
to zing with on your phone now.
What? Really?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm far too busy. I have Mavis and Dennis
in the hotel, and blah blah blah.
Um, did you guys hear that?
He actually said, "Blah blah blah".
I don't say, "Blah blah blah"!
What can I help you with,
Lord of Darkness?
Eh, Uh...
I'm looking for a Zing.
Okay, changing Thumbread.
No, no,
I'm looking for a date.
The date is Friday, July 13th.
No, no, no, no.
I want to meet someone.
Understood.
You want to eat dim sum.
Are you kidding me, right now?
Don't you get it?
I want to go on a date.
I'm... lonely.
I understand.
- You want Baloney.
- Ugh.
What? Look at that there,
come on. Huh?
Too many eyes. Too few eyes.
Not into tentacles.
Match found? No, no, no!
No, no!
- First things first.
- Whoa!
I'm not into games, you'd better have a job,
and my cats have to like you.
Oh, hey! No, no!
Oh, whoa, no!
- Dad?
- Oh, Mavis! Oh, what are you doing here?
I was just checking on the honeymoon suite
and I heard something.
Oh, I'm sorry my little bed-bug,
I wa... I was just cleaning the attic.
♫ Oh, Cleaning the attic, cleaning the attic,
La-la, So dirty in the attic ♫
- Who is that?
- Are you on the phone?
What? This? I was just... Eh... trying
to find a maid to help me with the mess.
A maid?! Who do you think...
Thank you, I'll check your apertures
and get after you. Goodbye!
♫ Ah-da-dee, Ooh-la-la,
Dee-doo ♫
- Oh! I didn't do it... I...
- Dad, stop trying to hide it from me?
- Hide? Who? I mean, what, me?
- Yes.
And I know what it is.
Uh, really?
You're stressed out
from working too hard.
Oh, okay, yes.
You got me, yes.
Hey, it's a big hotel, you know?
Can't get to everything.
What about you,
you are pretty busy yourself.
I know. It seems like now that
we're working together more,
we're seeing each other less.
Oh, yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm working too much, you're working too much.
We should really take a break.
Starting right now, night-night.
- Oh...
- I'm still here.
Aww...
Oh! Hey, honey.
You ready for... date night?
Aww... That's okay sweetheart,
you rest.
You know, dad's right.
We need a break.
We need to all be together again.
Like a family.
We used to.
Have you overworked
and stressed out?
Do need some family time?
Are you a monster?
Then you need a vacation.
A monster vacation.
Welcome aboard. Gremlin air.
Stop it! Clean the glass!
Ladies and gentlemen, please direct
your attention to the front of the cabin.
For your safety, please,
unbuckle your seat belts.
In the likely event, we experience
a sun dropping cabin pressure...
...oxygen will be provided for you.
- Can I stow that for you, sir?
- All right, thanks.
Beverages, beverages, snacks, beverages,
beverages, snacks, snacks, snacks, beverages!
- Coffee?
- That would be lovely.
Mavis, please, you're torturing me!
You know I hate surprises.
This is a fun surprise.
I know fun surprises.
Just tell me where we're going.
Why are we on the plane?
We can fly, you know?
Back in my day, people took trains.
Now, that's classy.
Sure, dad, 40 hours in a classic size room
with you and uncle Bernie,
and his smelly cigars.
Arguing who is more attractive,
Cleopatra or Nefertiti.
- Oh, Nefertiti.
- Okay dad, thank you.
Mavis, this is such an
amazing surprise.
I can't wait to spend time
with the people I love most.
But I beg of you...
tell me where we're going!
No, I've taken care of everything.
So, you don't need to worry.
You've been so stressed out lately.
It's time for you to relax.
- Well, isn't that better.
- Ooh yes, so relaxed.
I'm gonna go check
on you know who.
I'll be right back,
I have to go to the bathroom.
- Hey, did you see that?
- Dennis went to the bathroom!
Uh... Okay.
Psst! Hey, where are you?
There you are, Tinkles.
Don't worry, we'd never
leave you alone alive.
Okay, folks. You're free to move around
the cabin as we had started our descent.
So, any made plans
for the weekend, Netbale?
Oh, you know, the usual.
Gotta take the kids to soccer.
Snacks, beverages, snacks,
beverages, snacks...
Ladies and gentlemen, we've arrived
at our destination, The Bermuda Triangle.
Ooh.
Welcome to The Bermuda Triangle,
where you'll embark
on a monster cruise of a lifetime.
A cruise!?
Surprise!
Oh, no, no, no!
But it's... just like the hotel...
on the water.
I just figured you need a vacation
from running everyone else's vacation.
You've barely been out of the hotel since...
Well, since mom died.
But this is a chance
to make new room for us.
With all of us, with Dennis.
Who made you into such
an amazing daughter?
You.
Heh-heh, that's right.
What a proud man.
- Come on, Dennisovich, let's get cruising!
- Yehey!
Okay! Smile.
Thank you.
"No Pets Allowed"?
Uh-oh.
Perfect.
Dennis, come on.
Oh, hello. Welcome aboard.
Uh, this is Bob.
- Say, "Hi, Bob".
- Hi, Bob.
Oh, my Gosh, Griffin.
I'm like, so excited.
This is like, the nicest hotel
I've ever been to.
Yeah!
Man, this is amazing!
There's so much to do.
A living size swimming pool.
All you can eat buffet?!
Full service Spa?!
Ooh-ho, give me
a seaweed re-wrap.
Wow, it sounds like everything
we can do at our hotel?!
Except on the water!
You nailed it, honey.
Your dad is going to love this.
Best summer vacation ever!
Wait till you see
the itineraries.
Oh, that's nice.
Frank, "Fire, Bad" remember?
Oh, yeah, right, but uh...
maybe we can find your own fireworks
on the cruise, huh?
It's not the love boat, Frank.
I'm just here to have fun with my family.
Ahoy, there!
Welcome aboard.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Whoa! Who is that?
I am Captain Ericka, and yes,
I'm human.
But don't hold that against me,
I could not be more excited
to have all of you on-board,
our first ever monster cruise!
Dad, are you okay?
(SPEAKING TRANSYLVANIAN)
Oh, no. He's having
a heart attack!
Drac? Not likely.
And the only heart attack that can
hurt him is with a wooden stake.
It must be a stroke!
- Actually, I think it might be her.
- Ow!
Watch where you're pointing, mister.
I'm right here.
You always stand so close to me.
It's creepy.
...hiding, living in the shadows,
but not anymore.
You've stood up and waved your hand,
a claw or tentacle, and said,
"We're here, we are hairy
and it is our right to be scary"!
Now, it's time to celebrate.
You'll enjoy gourmet dinings, swirling
adventures and non-stop entertainment.
All awaits to our final destination.
The lost city that isn't
lost anymore, Atlantis!
Oh, yeah!
Whoa, the fish are acrobats.
The fishcrobats!
Hello, how can I
help you with?
So, you must be
the one and only, Dracula.
I have waited
so long to meet you.
Wow, you really don't age do you?
I'd kill for your skin.
(SPEAKING TRANSYLVANIAN)
Oh, you're speaking Transylvanian.
Oh, I always wanted to learn.
(SPEAKING TRANSYLVANIAN)
Oh, such a romantic language.
You know, there's just something about an accent
that makes a man sound so intelligent.
That's Transylvanian right there,
he's saying It's... "It's nice to meet you".
Oh, well, then.
Ali-boo-boo to you as well.
Drac! Drac!
Drac, snap out of it!
Wait, wait. I have always
wanted to do this, alright?
Wake, up! Wake up, Drac!
Snap out of it!
Hey, enough!
- Hey buddy, you okay?
- No, no, not okay. Not, okay.
I... I... I... Zinged.
(SINGING)
- Ooh.
- Ooh, Check that out.
Here we go.
- Hmm. Yummy.
- Grrr.
Papa!
"Kids Club"?
What's a kids club?
- Fish.
- That's right, dear.
I'm still not sure I understand.
- You take my kids all day on purpose?
- Fish.
That's right. What's exactly
don't you understand?
Why?
So, they can have a great time,
and you can have a great time.
Fish.
Oh, don't worry, you'll get them back
at the end of the day.
Oh, well.
That's better than nothing.
So... What do we do now?
I think... I think we do
whatever we want.
Whatever we want?
Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want.
Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want. Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want. Whatever we want.
Oh, hi. Hello.
How are you all doin'?
- Good evening, captain.
- Oh, well, hello. Oh, my goodness.
Would you mind uh... lifting, uh...
lifting your tail?
- You know?
- Oh, certainly.
Okay. Thank you so much.
- Oh, hello.
- Welcome aboard.
Oh, you were so right,
great-grandfather!
Monsters are disgusting!
They're animals!
I'll be right there!
Dracula, is he on-board?
Yes, I saw him.
Face to face, Ugh!
I was so nice to him.
That pale face of his, and his goofy smile.
Showing off his fangs.
Ugh! It's just like
you tought me.
He's even worse than I did!
It was that faithful night, that I realize,
the human could never defeat a monster.
But I wouldn't let
our family legacy die.
And so I began...
To search for an answer.
And I saw it,
in an ancient text.
An Instrument of destruction, so powerful
it destroyed Atlantis. A whole city of monsters.
And laired deep
within new runwood lane, waiting.
Endlessly,
a service for the lost city.
Time passed,
and my body began to fail me.
Oh, it was so fragile.
First, my liver then my spleen.
Followed by a kidney or two.
And my good looks. Oooh!
But I wouldn't let that stop me.
I replaced my feeling organs
with technology!
And look at me now.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, girl,
it's an improvement, really.
Um... sure.
And now after 120 years,
I finally found Atlantis.
Oh! Forget about all this! Let me get rid
of the dracula right now.
I was so close to him,
I could've just...
No, no, no, no!
We have to stick to the plan.
Lure the monsters to Atlantis,
retrieve the Instrument of destruction.
Trap them there,
and then flush them out.
It's temporary now.
Now, promise me.
You won't try and kill Dracula.
Ugh, fine! I promise!
Promise word.
I promise I wouldn't try
and kill Dracula. Okay?
Don't worry, great-grandfather,
I won't try and kill him...
I will kill him!
Oh! Darn it.
Work it, Dracula.
You know it.
Oh, looking good, Drac.
Feeling good, Frank.
Look at you, so fancy.
What? This? Please.
Ooh, dress to impress, huh?
Impress? Oh, who do I need
to impress?
Hey, is that Captain Ericka?
Oh no, no, no, no!
Oops. No, not her.
Ooh, that's great!
Very, amusing.
Sorry, Drac. You know, it's just...
We've never seen you like this.
I know, I know. It doesn't make any sense.
You can't zing twice. It's impossible!
But I did, so now I...
But what about, Mavis?
She wants you to be happy, right?
I'm sure she'll go
with the flow.
Oh, no, no, no! Mavis needs me,
she depends me.
I need to be home
with my family.
Hey, Murray here may be
from Egypt,
but you're the one in denial.
You guys get that?
- Ow! You hit me right in the...
- Mavis!
Don't say a word,
or I'll hunt your dreams.
Having fun?
Oh, I'm having even more fun,
now that you're here.
You know, dad, I feel really lucky
to have this time with you.
All of us together,
it's really special.
Me too, Spider-Monkey.
Now, are you ready for me
to destroy you in monster ball?
Whoo-hoo! Monster ball!
Come on, Papa Drac!
Oh, do bring it on!
For I am king of family fun!
Alright! Who is ready
to get pubbled?
I gotta warn you, I've played second team
co-ed Intramural volleyball at Santa Cruz.
Sure, pal. Whatever you say.
Everybody, just please, watch the hair.
Watch the hair!
Oh, let's go! Let's do this!
Oh, my gosh! This is gonna be
so much fun.
Be ready! Here comes the pain!
Not the hair! Not the hair!
No, no, no, no, no...
Oh, yes!
Captain Ericka,
you are needed on deck.
Next stop.
Bye-bye, Dracula.
Okay, baby!
Oh, baby. I got this.
Hey, there monsters.
Yeah! What I'd say?!
We're arriving
at our first destination.
The under water volcano!
Everyone, grab your scuba gear and get ready
to explore the wonders of the sea.
Especially, you. Count Dracula.
You see that now? She likes you.
- Oh, no, no, no, no...
- That sounds like a zing in full effect.
No, no, no, no, no...
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes...
I'm just here to have family fun.
Family, family, fun, fun.
Oh, yes, right about here...
Right this way, everyone.
Welcome to one of the true wonders
of the under watered kingdom.
I give you, Volcano Del Fuego!
Or as the local sea life call it...
Oh, what a cute family.
What? No it's not!
Dracula, bad! Dracula, bad!
Frank, we just ate. I can't believe
you're hungry already.
I'm sorry. You know what it is... It's all just...
All that sea-food, just swimming around it. When I say food.
Oh, man!
Oh, Dracula, Dracula, Dracula,
Dracula, Dracula!
I get so close,
it's almost like he's teasing me.
I just... I can't stand it anymore!
I have to get him!
Boy, that under water
volcano was hot!
Oh. Hi, Bob.
Buddy, we promised you we'd play... uh...
ping-pong now?
Um, Dennis, who is this?
- Uh... it's our friend, Bob.
- Say, "Hi, Bob".
Hi, Bob.
Okay! Time to go play ping-pong.
Drac! Drac! Drac! Drac!
Drac! Drac!
Hey, boys, where's the fire?
- Oh, uh! Well, Griffin here, he...
- He has something to tell you.
Me?
Uh... Oh! Yeah, I got this
bite on my hand, and since you know...
Gee... You're a biting expert,
I thought you could take me...
- Yeah, come on. Over here!
- The light is there...
Okay...
Okay, what is going on? You guys
are acting weirder than normal.
And your normal is pretty weird.
You are not gonna believe
what we heard but...
♫ Everybody loves the Drac!
She can't get enough about Drac! Drac! ♫
♫ Drac, dance back! You got the zing!
All the zing, zing, zing ♫
Shh! I told you
I don't want to upset, Mavis.
But, what are you talking about?!
Okay, well see, Frank on hungry
so, no surprise there, but uh...
We swam back the ship,
and we found Ericka, raving about you!
She can't live without you, buddy.
It's serious!
♫ You can't deny the zing, baby ♫
So, Drac, this is great. Now, are you
gonna make her move on your coffin or what?
Ah, yes. Maybe?
No, no... It's been awhile,
I don't even know, where to start.
It's easy, Drac.
Make some small talk.
And remember to smile.
- Look into her eyes.
- Jimmy Cash her.
- Say something funny.
- Ask her where her parts are from.
- Oh, and say that her wrappings look nice.
- You like coffins.
Compliment her.
"Your neck looks delicous"
Here she comes.
Okay, Drac. Hit it.
Your delicous neck wrappings are in a nice coffin.
Would you like to see my parts?
Yes, I'd love
to go out with you.
- What?
- What?!
Canteena, midnight.
Don't be late.
Phew! That was a close one.
- Wait!
- Tinkles, come back!
Stop it, Tinkles!
Stop!
- Tinkles, stop!
- Wait!
Move, move, move...
Tinkles, stop!
I've been found!
You'll never get me, monster!
Shh! Tinkles, stop! Shh! Shh!
Ew...
Everybody, we are pulling up
to our next stop. The deserted island.
It's time to get lost on the beach.
And we hope you, a time in yourselves.
Some fun and relaxation.
Whoo-hoo! Beach time!
Johnny, you go set everything up.
And, dad, you go get in line for the snow cones.
You know, actually, I was thinking,
You and Charlie should spend some time together.
What do you call it again?
Eh... Date night?
Date night?!
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I thought me and the guys,
would take this oppurtunity
to spend some quality time
- with Dennis.
- Oh, okay. That's a great idea.
Come on, Johnny. Date night.
Da-da-da-date night!
Okay, here you go!
- Good girl!
- I got this one.
- What was that?
- It sounds like our children.
It is our children! Run!
Frank, would you rub some moon-screen
on my back, before I get burned?
Wait one second, honey.
I-I... the kids buried me in the sand.
Mmm. Thanks, honey.
Isn't this place amazing?
Whoa, the menu is in the bottle!
Genius! Isn't that awesome, honey?
What? Oh, Sorry. I was just thinking
about my dad.
Don't you think
he's acting weird lately?
Not really. Besides having
a huge crush on the Captain.
- What?
- Oh, yeah. The love boat,
is definitely making another run.
No way, he's... he's my dad.
I know, right? It's weird.
When my parents kiss,
I still close my eyes.
I guess, I never thought about him
with anyone besides my mom.
You're cool with it though, right?
Of course,
I-I want him to be happy.
Totally.
Totally...
Good evening, my friend.
Have you, eh... beverage?
To quench me of my, bargement.
Yes, of course, Mr. Chupacabra.
Thank you very much.
You look ravishing.
Oh, um... thank you.
I was just...
So, um... does Captain Ericka
have a last name?
Uh... Uh.. Oh, uh...
Oh, Guacamolle!
Ericka Guacamolle?
That's so... International.
No! Guacamolle for us to share.
Oh, how beautiful is that
full moon tonight.
Look, right behind you.
Mmm. The food here
is to die for.
Holy moly, that was a lot
of Guacamolle.
Are you feeling all right?
Totally fine. Why?
No reason.
Ugh, there must have been a garlic
in the Guacamolle.
Oh no. Isn't that deadly for you?
No, no, no...
It's just that I...
Garlic Intolerant!
Was that you?
Oh, yeah! Dolphin surfing!
Whoa!
- Hi, mama. Hi, papa.
- Hi, guys.
Oh, hey there!
- ¡Adiós!
- Hey.
Isn't my dad in there too?
Oh!
Don't worry, I'm over here.
Blah, blah, blah.
No, Papa Drac's not here,
he's on his date.
Date?
Please forgive me. I...
I'm just very nervous. You see...
I haven't had a date since...
my wife died.
How old was your daughter?
She was just an infant.
It was hard being a single dad,
but I... I did my best.
I never knew my mother either...
- or my father.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Who raised you?
- My great-grandfather.
I basically grew up on this ship.
- That's why you're a captain.
- Yeah, it's all I've ever known.
And it's just... expected.
You know, a family thing.
I understand,
family is everything.
You have to honor the past.
But we make our own future.
- Dad?
- Mavis?!
Johnny!
Captain Ericka and I, were just...
Discussing the hospitality industry, you know.
- Drac workscout!
- You're working now?
This is supposed to be a vacation.
A family vacation.
I-I should really go...
do captainy things.
Dad, you said you were gonna
spend time with Dennis?
Dennis? Dennis? Dennis! Dennis?
Oh, yeah, you're right. Where is that kid?
Dennisovich? You're supposed
to be with me.
Come on now, kid. It's family time.
Quit hiding, Dennis!
- What was that about?
- You mean your dad's date?
It wasn't a date.
It was... work stuff.
Uh-huh?
I'm telling you, Johnny, there is something
about that woman I don't trust.
But you want your dad
to be happy, right?
Yes. Just... not with her.
Whoo! Heads up, honey, this Guac
is loaded with garlic.
Garlic?
Aww, that's a cute tune, honey.
- We've been up, all night!
- Let's stay up all day too!
Let's get wild.
Ericka!
- Ahh! Huh! What?
- Just where have you been, young lady?
- Uh.. doing the work?
- Wearing that?
You were with him. I know it!
- Who?
- Who? You know who!
You've been sneaking around my back,
trying to kill Dracula again, haven't you?
So, what if I have? I am a grown woman!
I have the right to kill whoever I want.
It's not just about you.
You could've ruin the legacy.
What if he discovered
who you were?
I know, I know, I wasn't thinking. There's just...
There's just something about him,
That just drives me crazy!
I just... I see him and I want to...
- Punch him.
- Uh, I guess.
I can't wait
to get this over with.
Don't worry.
It won't be long now.
Once you recovered the instrument
of destruction, no one can stop us.
Not even Dracula!
- Excuse me!
- Spy!
Now, quickly,
before someone comes!
Oh!
Everyone assemble
on the floor with deck.
We are arriving
at our final destination.
From the depths of creation,
the mighty city has risen once again.
Home to the greatest monster civilization
the world has ever known.
Far surpassing Athens in Rome,
and hearts culture and sophistication.
I give you the legendary
lost city of... Atlantis.
Ahh! It's a giant Kraken!
♫ There's a place
you've gotta be ♫
♫ A thousands leagues
beneath the sea ♫
♫ And it's waiting over here
for you and me ♫
♫ Gonna take you for a ride ♫
♫ But first you gotta come inside ♫
♫ Get ready for
the party's on tonight ♫
♫ So, relax and just unwind ♫
♫ Leave your worries, all behind ♫
♫ And get ready for
the party's on tonight ♫
Welcome to Atlantis!
♫ So, get ready... ♫
♫ It's party time ♫
♫ It's party time ♫
- Ooh, I am so excited.
- Oh, Kentucky!
Going in red.
Oh, no, you don't. Last time you gambled,
you lost an arm and a leg.
- Literally! Replacement aren't just...
- Don't raise your voice...
flying around like they were
in the old days.
So, no gamble!
- Frank!
- Yes, you got it. No gambling!
Tinkles, stop, wait!
- Stop it, Tinkles!
- Wait!
Have you have seen Mavis?
I have to find her!
- Why? What's going on?
- I'm going to tell her about Ericka!
I can't lie
to my own daughter anymore.
She is the most important person
in the world to me.
I have to tell her the truth.
Right after I talk to Ericka.
Hey!
- All right, I'm all...
- Frank? Are you sure you know what you're doing?
I got this. I'm all in.
- Johnny, have you seen my dad?
- Maybe he's with Bob.
- Why would he be with Bob?
- Bob's a great guy.
- Oh, there he is.
- Who, Bob?
There he is. Hi, Bob!
There it is!
- You saved my life.
- Of course. Why wouldn't I?
I just... I can't believe
you would do that for a human.
Humans? Monsters?
What's the difference?
Yeah, right... right.
Wait, what, uh...
what are you doing here?
Oh, I, well, you know,
Vampires can predict the future, so...
I know you would need my help.
Huh? Never heard that before.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a well known fact.
Well, eh... What are you doing here?
Oh, yeah, uh... I'm here to get that.
Yeah, it's a family heirloom.
Yeah, it was lost at... at sea,
and um, my great-grandfather has lost, once...
Uh, totally obsessed with.
Gotta get it back. So, anyhoo...
Thanks for saving my life.
But um, I can take it from here.
Gotta be a little more careful.
How many times can you save my life, right?
I don't know. Every time?
Really? Well, then...
Wow!
Oh! That was incredible.
Oh, uh, don't you want
to get your family heirloom thingy?
Oh, right.
Got it.
Oh, let me get that for you.
- Dad!
- Mavis?
What are you doing to my father?
Mavis, stop! Put her down.
No, she's trying to hurt you.
Why can't you see that?
Because I... Because...
Because I Zinged...
- What?
- I Zinged... With Ericka!
No, that can't be true.
- You only zing once.
- That's what I thought too.
Zing? What's a Zing?
Oh, well, it's a thing... For monsters.
It's kind of like our love at first sight.
What? No. No, no, no.
You don't even know me.
- Well, not yet, but we'll just...
- No, no, you don't understand...
I can't be with you, I could...
never be with someone like you.
I could never be with... a monster.
Dad, I'm so sorry.
- I...
- It doesn't matter.
You heard what she said.
But a zing never lies.
Ah, you got it!
Yes!
Now that we have the instrument of destruction.
Our family legacy will be fulfilled.
But first, we'll draw them in
with a dance party.
I love to dance.
Frank, could you zip that up?
We're gonna be late.
Where did you get those?
Uh, see I guess I... Eh...
I lost my hands...
Gambling, but... No big deal.
Look, I've got these. For the sake of new...
Look at this.
Clap, clap, click, click.
I-I kinda like 'em.
I like 'em.
Ah! I guess the party's this way.
Let's get them party started right!
Huh?
I thought they said
the party was this way.
DJ in a clam shell?
I'm so jealous.
I can't believe my dad zinged
with someone who's trying to kill him.
Yep, zing makes you do
crazy things.
Really, John?
What's most important to understand...
is that love is an infinite enigma
that is beyond our understanding.
You and I have were two halves.
A world apart.
But then, we followed the strand of destiny,
and were brought together and now has made one whole.
But what if she and he...
You must release all the negativity,
and look within.
For bond is unbreakable.
You're right, honey.
Wow... thanks.
Whoa, you sounded pretty smart, dad.
Oh, that? That was just the velocity
of secret zing from my favorite TV show,
when I was a kid.
Kung-fu Shaolin Monk Master.
Anyways,
let's get back to dancing.
Cool.
- Dad? You have to talk to Ericka.
- What?
I know. I know what I said
before, but...
maybe I over reacted a teensy bit.
It's just the thought
of losing you.
What? What are you
talking about? Losing me?
Well, obviously after you get married,
you're gonna live on the ship, and travel around the world.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Slow down, Mavis.
There are two things
I can promise you.
One: nothing can ever take me
from you and all my family.
Two: I will never live on a boat.
You're my cute little tarantula!
How can I ever leave you?
Dad, seriously? Go talk to her.
I can't. You heard what she said.
She could never be with someone like me.
No, dad. You're just a half and you have
to follow your destiny to find it. Infinite whole.
You sound like Johnny.
Point is,
you can't deny a zing.
Monster? Human? Unicorn?
It doesn't matter.
So, go to her. Now!
Okay. I'm on it.
Hey man, you're not allowed up here.
The DJ booth is a sacred space...
No, no, no, Tinkles!
Quiet, quiet!
Who is this?
Heh! I know you recognize me.
Your greatest rival.
Hmm? Oh, right! You're on that
holiday inbound by the airport.
No! It is I!
Abraham Van Helsing.
Van Helsing?
After all this years.
You look... awful.
Well, who always redicrocent self.
Well, this will serve you out!
And all monsters!
Eh... Huh? That's just Ericka's
family heirloom thingy.
Good, Malericka.
Ericka?
You fool, not only is she
the ships captain,
but she also happens to be...
Wait, you tell him.
I'm his great-granddaughter.
I'm Ericka Van Helsing.
I knew there was something
wrong with her.
- But...
- I...
...see what happened... I...
Well, now that we're all caught up.
Let's get back to the dying.
Behold, the key to the demise
of all monsters.
Uh... let's see, right and then...
Listen to the melody
of your destruction.
Ooh, I didn't know
it'd be that good.
Yeah!
Hey, look! It's the Kraken...
Everybody out, now!
We're trapped!
Everybody get back!
This has to stop now!
Drac, no!
Dad!
Mavis!
Time for the
immortal Dracula to die.
Dad!
No!
Ericka!
Bob! Help!
Tinkles?! Dennis?
Um, no. Bob is Tinkles?
How did he get here?
But thank goodness he did.
'Cause look!
You can't do this,
you're wrong about monsters!
Dracula, he saved my life.
What?!
I'm so sorry, Drac. I was trying
to kill you this whole time.
But then I realize
how wrong I was.
How wrong all of this is.
And then I...
I zinged.
Zinged? What's a zing?
It's a monster thing.
You wouldn't understand.
It's like true love.
Love?
Well, I guess the legacy
ends with me.
That's an awkward ending.
Nope! It's time to start
a new legacy.
A monster-human legacy.
No!
Drac! Van Helsing's beat are controlling
the giant octopus thingy.
If there's one thing I hate,
it's an evil DJ.
Bringing...
Positive energy.
Get ready for a DJ battle!
You just carry all that stuff
around with you?
Once a bar mitzvah DJ,
always a bar mitzvah DJ.
We're gonna use good music,
to defeat his evil music.
- What?
- Trust me, I know the tunes,
but you've got the power.
Alright. Okay. Opening song
is me off the she-zack!
Ooh, got it! Play this.
What is that noise?
Whoa, I like this one.
This feels good.
You fool!
Oh! His music is too powerful.
We're gonna need something even more positive.
Now, Drac!
Really?
It has a nice message.
I've had enough with this nonsense!
Johnny, we need the most brain dominating tone
happening in this song thingy,
in the history of all the universe!
Come on, come on, come on...
Where is it, where is it...
- Hurry up!
- I do not know!
There's too many choices!
No, wait!
This... is... it!
What the?
Boy, that stinks.
It's working.
Hey, Johnny's corny music
is defeating the evil music.
I kinda like it.
♫ Hey, Macarena! ♫
No!
I'm a slave to this rhythm!
♫ Hey, Macarena! ♫
No!
Drac, what are you doing?
Gotta be greater than Hades.
Why? Why after everything...
...would you save my life?
Because basically,
we are all the same.
Claws or hands,
two eyes or three eyes.
- Green skin.
- No skin.
- Prickly.
- Brainy.
I'm sorry.
You are amazing.
Look at me, Dennis.
Look at me.
Come on, you can't deny it.
No, I'm too young to zing.
I feel kind of silly now.
For decades,
I have hunted your kind...
...or executed you.
The only thing I can do
to make it up to you is...
Give you... eh...
A 30% refund.
- Oh, hell no!
- That's preposterous!
Oh, alright.
Full refund.
Wayne, Wanda.
What happened to you guys?
Yeah. We like,
hardly saw you on the cruise.
Yeah, I know. We got tranquilized and spent
most of the trip locked in a closet.
We're gonna book it again
for the holidays.
- Hi! Checking in?
- Yes. Thank you.
Great, I have a room
all ready for you.
Hey, buddy, would you mind...
Sure, thing pal.
Okay. Okay, what's going on,
Sneaky-pants?
Oh, nothing.
It's just, I wanted to make sure
nobody would bother us.
Oh, why?
Are you going to suck up my blood,
Blah, blah, blah?
No.
I was going to ask you if...
you would marry me?
Well, what do you say?
Will you marry me?
I... I...
(SPEAKING TRANSYLVANIAN)
Huh?...
I mean... I would...
(SPEAKING TRANSYLVANIAN)
What's she saying?
Uh... I'm not sure.
Yes!
