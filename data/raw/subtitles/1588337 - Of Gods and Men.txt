I said, "You are gods,
sons of the Most High.
"But you shall die like men
and fall like princes."
OF GODS AND MEN
Lord, open my lips
And my mouth will proclaim your praise
Aspirin...
And cough syrup.
There's hot tea.
Help me, Papa.
- Brother Luc.
- Nouredine, labesse??
And you?
Saturday is Jamel's khtana.
Will there be a party?
You're all invited.
- Will you come?
- I'd love to.
See you later. Take care.
Yes, you too.
Little brat! You're here?
Not at school today?
Good.
It's almost dry.
Stop with the bandages.
Be sure to keep her out of the sun.
That would be dangerous. Forbidden.
Otherwise, all's well.
Little kiss.
What else?
I see.
It's serious.
Be right back.
Asleep, brother?
Here.
Guide us in the straight path,
the path of those
whom Thou hast blessed,
not those against
whom Thou art wrathful,
nor those who are astray.
Amen.
The Messenger believes
in what was sent down to him
from his Lord, and the believers:
each one believes in God,
His angels, His Books
and His Messengers.
We make no division
between any one of His Messengers.
They say, "We hear and obey.
"Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness.
"Unto Thee is the homecoming."
God charges
no soul save to its capacity.
It will be rewarded for good it has done
and punished for evil it has done.
Lord, take us not to task
if we forget or make mistake.
Lord, charge us not with a load
such as Thou didst lay
upon those before us.
Lord, do not burden us beyond
what we have the strength to bear.
And pardon us, and forgive us
and have mercy on us.
Thou art our Protector.
And help us against the people
of the unbelievers.
How do you know
when you're in love?
There's...
...something inside you
that comes alive.
The presence of someone.
It's irrepressible and makes your heart
beat faster, usually.
It's an attraction, a desire...
It's very beautiful.
No use asking too many questions.
It just happens.
Things are as usual, then suddenly...
...happiness arrives, or the hope of it.
it's lots of things.
But you're in turmoil.
Great turmoil.
Especially the first time.
Your father spoke to me about Khaled.
My father speaks too much.
I don't want that.
I feel none of the things you mentioned
when I see Khaled.
That means it's not very serious.
My father wants it, not me.
That's another problem.
Ever been in love?
Several times, yes.
And then I encountered another love,
even greater.
And I answered that love.
It's been a while now.
Over 60 years.
Here,
you have to put your son's address.
He's no longer at home?
He lives far away now.
Abdallah...
Taroudi.
13 rue d'Etretat.
Le Havre.
And here they ask for two photos.
Do you have photos?
Listen, Tuesday
we're going to the market.
We can take you along.
And have photos taken.
Okay?
My cousin from Mostaganem...
They killed her granddaughter.
This afternoon.
She's 18. Samira.
They stabbed her on the bus.
Right in the heart.
Those dogs.
They threw her out like a dog.
And for a veil!
She didn't wear the hijab.
What's the problem with these people?
it's beyond me.
Is that normal?
God says in the Koran,
"You kill your brother, you go to hell."
They say they're religious.
They've never read the Koran.
In the Koran, it's written down.
Does it make sense to you?
Look at France.
Schoolgirls make an uproar
about wearing a veil.
The world's gone mad, Christian.
True.
They're killing imams too.
Yesterday they killed an imam
in the street.
Where are we going?
I don't know who these people are.
Only God knows.
This is new. No one understands.
Who's killing who?
We'll pray for Samira and her family.
May she go to Heaven.
It's not mine.
- Whose then?
- The haji's.
Get lost!
Kill him!
Beat it!
Are you stupid?
Christian!
They killed the Croatians!
Our friends, the workers.
Throats slashed, all of them.
You need military protection.
That is not an option.
How can you say that?
Those men were killed nearby!
The atrocities will continue.
The Walt's offer deserves
to be discussed.
There are families here.
Think of them.
I made my decision. I refuse.
Let's speak inside.
We'll lock the gate at 7:30
and take no night calls.
Do you think that's enough?
You don't know them.
Try to make him see reason.
Is your phone working?
We can't complain.
Call us before it's too late.
Because he is with us
in this time of violence
Let us not dream
that he is everywhere
Other than where we die
Let us make haste
Let us draw patience from him
Let us turn to the Man of Sorrows
Who beckons us from the cross
Because he is with us
as on Easter morn
Let us not forget
The blood he shed
Let us break the bread
Let as drink
from the chalice of passage
Let us greet the one
who sacrificed himself
By loving us until the end
Through Him, with Him and in Him,
You shall receive, Almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honour,
forever and ever.
How could you decide this
without consulting us?
All our lives are at stake.
What would you have done?
I'd have let everyone speak
and listened to each position.
To answer what, in the end?
The answer doesn't matter.
The very principle of community
is compromised by your attitude.
Who wants the army
present in the monastery?
You refuse to understand
what we're saying.
I do understand!
None of us chose to live here,
to be protected
by a corrupt government.
Christian,
we didn't elect you
to decide on your own.
And if they come here?
We lie down and die?
It's a risk.
We were called to live here.
In this country, with these people,
who are also afraid.
We'll live with this unknown, yes.
I didn't come here
to commit collective suicide.
Maybe we can try to figure out
what each of us could do,
if they came here.
What's there to do?
Look at the Croatians.
Play hide-and-seek.
Cough.
Once more.
You'll outlive us all.
Hello, haji.
Still got your head?
I don't care.
They can have my head.
- May I?
- Sure. Be my guest.
The roads are blocked.
I won't go to Meznir today.
Not after what happened.
We don't need anything.
I'll let you know.
Christmas is in a week.
You know it's important
for us to be here together.
Thanks again.
Talk to you soon.
"Accepting our powerlessness
and our extreme poverty
"is an invitation,
an urgent appeal to create with others
"relationships not based on power.
"Recognizing my weaknesses,
I accept those of others.
"l can bear them,
make them mine
"in imitation of Christ.
"Such an attitude transforms us
for our mission.
"Weakness in itself is not a virtue,
"but the expression
of a fundamental reality
"which must constantly
be refashioned by faith,
"hope and love.
"The apostle's weakness
is like Christ's,
"rooted in the mystery of Easter
"and the strength of the spirit.
"it is neither passivity
nor resignation.
"it requires great courage
"and incites one
to defend justice and truth
"and to denounce the temptation
"of force and power."
End of article.
New article.
By Carlo Carretto,
"The God Who is Coming".
"Often throughout my life
"I've wondered
how God could act so strangely.
"Why does he stay silent so long?
"Why is faith so bitter?"
And nothing exists except love
Except love which now begins
By separating sand from water
God has prepared earth like a cradle
Far his coming from above
This is the night
Happy night in Palestine
And nothing exists except the Child
Except the Child of life divine
What do you want?
Are you the Pope?
Where's the Pope?
There's no Pope here.
Your leader.
His name!
Brother Christian.
Who are you?
Ali.
Here he is.
This is Christian.
What do you want?
This is a house of peace.
Are you Christian?
No weapons allowed here.
If you wish to speak,
you must leave them outside.
Please.
I never part with mine.
Follow me. We'll talk outside.
I need the doc.
He has to come with us.
Impossible.
I have three men wounded
an hour away.
He can't leave here. He's sick.
He's old and asthmatic.
Brother Luc sees patients at the clinic.
He tends to everyone
who needs his help.
Their identity is not an issue
and never will be.
That's all.
So you can give us medicine.
We're short on supplies.
We see 100 villagers a day.
Enough!
You have no choice!
Yes.
I do.
We can't give what we don't have.
Ask your brothers in the village.
We live modestly.
With products we grow.
You know the Koran?
"Those nearest in love
to the believers
"are those who say,
'We are Christians'
"Among them are priests and monks."
"Priest and monks
"and they wax not proud."
That's why
we're close to our neighbours.
Come on, let's go.
Tonight is different from other nights.
Why?
It's Christmas.
We celebrate the birth
of the Prince of peace.
The Prince of peace?
Sidna Aissa.
Jesus.
I'm sorry, then.
I didn't know.
Christophe?
Michel?
Come out now.
They're gone.
We're fine. We made it.
Hold this down gently.
You can let go.
You'll be fine. Don't worry.
This is the night
The immense night of origins
And nothing exists except love
Except love which now begins
By separating sand from water
Gad has prepared the earth like a cradle
Far his coming from above
This is the night
The happy night of Palestine
And nothing exists except the Child
Except the Child of life divine
By taking flesh of our flesh
God our desert did refresh
And made a land of boundless spring
This is the night
The long night in which we grope
And nothing exists except this place
Except this place of ruined hope
By stopping in our abode
God, as with the bush, did forebode
The world on which fire would fall
Why...
...not give them medicine?
We have enough.
If you have medicine,
I'd like to know about it.
We can't start negotiating.
Every day they'll ask for more.
I agree with Luc.
Don't forget, I was held at gunpoint.
If we stay,
our lives would be at risk every day.
I became a monk to live.
Not to sit back
and have my throat slit.
You're right, Celestin.
We shouldn't be seeking martyrdom.
Maybe we should leave.
Or at least
take refuge in a safer place.
I think that Celestin
is asking a good question.
They've come once.
They'll be back sooner than we think.
The fact that
you refused all their demands
could be taken as a declaration of war.
Look what they did to the Croatians.
If they'd wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.
Maybe Fayattia
isn't the only one who decides.
Maybe others will come back tomorrow.
There's another solution.
Leave for good.
We should each decide
according to his own conscience.
Go back to France
or to another,
safer monastery in Africa.
To leave is to run away.
And to leave the village
to the terrorists.
We'd do it gradually,
so the villagers won't worry.
That won't change a thing.
The Good Shepherd doesn't
abandon his flock to the wolves.
We should each express our opinion
about leaving.
Jean-Pierre?
We stay.
Since when do we yield to arms?
Paul?
I think we should leave.
Gradually.
Celestin?
I'm ill. I want to leave.
Luc?
To leave is to die.
I'm staying.
Michel?
I have no one else, anywhere.
I'll stay.
Amedee?
I don't know yet.
We need to think...
...and pray together.
I think we should leave.
And you, Christian?
I agree with Amedee.
it's too early to decide.
Help will come from the Lord.
Who made heaven and earth.
We do not know your mystery
Infinite love
But you do have a heart
For you seek the prodigal son
And hold against your breast
This troublesome child
Which is the world of mortals
We do not see your face
Infinite love
But you do have eyes
For you weep through the oppressed
And look upon us
With a shining gaze
That reveals your forgiveness
