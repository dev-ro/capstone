EVAN:
Dear Evan Hansen...
...today is going to be
an amazing day,
and here's why.
Because today, all you have
to do is just be yourself.
But also confident.
That's-that's important.
And interesting.
Easy to talk to.
Approachable.
But mostly just be yourself.
You know, that's number one,
obviously. Be yourself.
But, like, a confident version
of yourself,
like, approachable
and interesting
and not weird or anxious
or depressed.
But you're not weird
or anxious or depressed.
I don't even know
why you're bringing it up.
You can't be scared
to talk to other people.
You said that you'd be better.
You said this year
would be different.
You're overthinking it.
Do you like having no friends?
All you have to do
is just be yourself.

So you just didn't eat
last night?
I wasn't hungry.
You're a senior in high school.
You need to be able
to order dinner for yourself.
You can do it all online.
You don't have to talk
to anybody.
Okay, well, that's not, that's
not true, actually, though,
because, um, the credit card's
expired, so you have to meet
the delivery person
at the door, you know?
You have to pay them
with cash at the door.
You have to greet them.
You know, you have
to figure out the right,
the right, um...
the-the proper greeting.
Okay.
This is what you're supposed
to be working on, sweetheart,
with Dr. Sherman.
Have you been doing those
letters he wants you to do?
"Dear Evan Hansen."
I mean, I've definitely...
I-I've been trying to.
Those letters are important,
honey.
You have to keep working.
We can't go back to where
you were last year, right?
Um, you have an appointment
this afternoon.
I'm working till 6:00,
so you're gonna
have to take the bus.
Hey.
I thought you could go around
and ask all the other kids
to sign your cast.
Perfect icebreaker, right?
- What happened to your shirt?
- There was a stain on it.
- Wha... But it's brand-new.
- Yes, I know.
I was... I'm so mad.

JARED:
Evan.
What?
It's Zoe Murphy
in that hot band shirt
you love so much.
Can you just...
Can you please stop?
Well, hey,
maybe she's into you, too.
Maybe you should talk to her,
tell her how you feel.
I've tried talking to her.
Really?
Yes. Yeah, I...
I stayed afterwards,
um, last year
after the spring
jazz band concert,
but, um, I didn't go up to her
because I was worried
that my hands were sweaty.
Which they weren't even,
they weren't even that sweaty.
I just... I was worried
that they were sweaty,
and sometimes
worrying that they're sweaty
makes them sweaty,
so I just went to the bathroom
and I put 'em under, like,
the hand dryer thing,
but then
they were still sweaty.
They were just, um...
They were just also warm.
I was kidding.
You obviously should not
talk to her.
You are a literal disaster.

Go, Bobcats!
(cheering)
Go, Bobcats.
So awesome.
So awesome, everyone.
Phenomenal, really.
You know what's not phenomenal?
Deforestation.
So, what happened
to your arm exactly?
Um, I was climbing a tree,
and I fell.
It was stupid.
You fell out of a tree?
What are you, five?
Well, um...
So, actually,
I-I worked this summer
as an apprentice park ranger
at Ellison State Park.
(Jared sighs)
It's a funny story,
though, because...
there was, like, this solid
ten minutes after I fell
where I just lay there
on the ground,
um, waiting for someone
to come get me, you know?
I was like, "Any second now."
You know?
I just kept... I, like...
I was saying to myself,
"Any second now.
Here they come." So...
Did they?
No, nobody came.
That's the, um...
That's what's funny.
That's not funny.
Model U.N....
Well, anyways, um, how was...
Did you, um...
How was camp?
Well, I put on 13 pounds
of pure muscle.
Also, I hooked up
with this Brazilian dude
who is literally a supermodel.
So, yeah, hope that answers
your question.
So let's have Mother Nature's
back so that she'll have ours.
(students cheering)
Yeah! Yeah!
All right, thank you, Alana.
Very inspirational.
All right,
so let's have a great year,
and, uh, go, Bobcats!
- (students cheering)
- (marching band playing)
Hey, um...
would you want to sign my cast?
Uh, you could,
you could be the first.
Why would I do that?
Well, I just... I thought, um,
because we're friends and...
We're family friends, Evan.
That's an entirely
different thing.
Please respect that.
(marching band song ends)

'Cause you s-s... you said Evan,

I'm Zoe.
Sorry.
I should... I think... Sorry.

EVAN:
Dear Evan Hansen,
turns out this wasn't
an amazing day after all.
This isn't gonna be an
amazing week or an amazing year
because why would it be?
Oh, I know.
Because there's Zoe.
Who I don't even know
and who doesn't know me, but...
Maybe if I did, maybe if
I could just talk to her,
maybe things would be better.
Or...
...maybe nothing would be
different at all.
I wish everything
was different.
I wish I was different.
I wish I was part of something.
I wish that anything I said
mattered to anyone.
But it doesn't,
and it never did.
And it never will.
I mean, face it, would anyone
even notice if I just...
disappeared tomorrow?
Sincerely, your best
and most dearest friend,
Me.
CONNOR:
Hey.
What happened to your arm?
Um...
I was climbing a tree,
and I fell.
You fell out of a tree?
(laughs)
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.
I know.
S-Sorry, um, I think I
accidentally printed something.
Yeah, we're all waiting.
Um, no one signed your cast.
No, I-I know.
I'll sign it.
Oh, you don't...
you really don't have to...
Do you have a Sharpie?
Oh, um, I don't. Shoot.
Oh, here's one.
Nice.
Wow, that's great.
Now we can both pretend
we have friends.
Uh, "Dear Evan Hansen."
Here you go.
Y-Yeah, that's mine.
That's mine.
- I'll... I can take it, sorry.
- "Because there's Zoe..."
Is this about my sister?
What? No, no.
Who's-who's your sister?
- You wanted me to find this?
- What?
You saw I was here,
so you started writing this
- and you started talking to me.
- No.
No, you started talking to me.
So that I would read
some creepy shit
about my sister
and freak out, right?
- Why would I do that?
- So then you can tell everyone
that I'm crazy. Right?
- Right?!
- Gentlemen! - (shushes)
EVAN:
No, I really...
Look, I really need that back,
so can...
Look, can you please
just give it back?
Just-just please don't

Hi.
HEIDI (over speaker):
Hi, honey. I'm so sorry.
Erica called in at the
last minute with a stomach bug,
and there's only
one other nurse on tonight,
so I-I volunteered
to take her shift.
I hope you weren't
waiting for me to eat.
- No, I already ate.
- Um, it's just they, uh,
they announced
more budget cuts this morning,
so anything I can do to show
that I'm a team player,
you know?
- How was your day?
- Fine.
It was, it was pretty good.
Yeah? You know, I-I texted
with Meera this morning,
and she said that Jared was
really looking forward
to seeing you and reconnecting.
I thought that was nice.
Yeah, he's so nice.
- HEIDI: How was Dr. Sherman?
- Pretty good.
Any change to your meds?
EVAN:
Um, no.
Oh, God, here he comes.
Um, all right, I-I-I...
All right, love you. Bye.
- (line beeps)
- Okay, I love you...
too.
JARED: A letter to yourself.
I mean, what is that,
like some kind of sex thing?
No. No, it's not a sex thing.
It's... It was an assignment
from my therapist.
Ew. Why-why are you
telling me this?
Well, I didn't know
who else to tell.
You're my only f...
family friend.
Oh, that's sad.
Look, Connor isn't here
again today.
That's-that's
three days in a row.
And h-he hasn't done anything
with it yet, you know,
like put it online or whatever,
because I've-I've been checking.
So, you know, maybe he just...
maybe he forgot, right?
Right. Right.
Or maybe he didn't,
because he's definitely
gonna put it online.
Dude, Connor Murphy is batshit.
Don't you remember when
he threw a printer at Mrs. G
in the second grade because
he couldn't be line leader?
Like, he was seven.
Just imagine
what he's capable of now.
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Evan Hansen, please report
to Mr. Howard's office.
Oh, damn.
Evan.
Connor Murphy's mother and
stepfather are here to see you.
They want to speak in private.
Hi.
Hello.
Why don't you go ahead, honey.
I'm going as fast as I can.

This is...
Connor wanted you to have this.
LARRY: Yeah, we didn't know
you were friends.
Oh, well, we didn't think
Connor had any friends,
frankly, and...
and then we see this note,
and it seems to suggest
pretty clearly that
you and Connor were, uh...
Or at least for Connor...
"Dear Evan Hansen."
He addressed it to you.
He wrote it to you.
These are the words that
he wanted to share with you.
His last words.
Connor took his own life.
(whispers):
He what?
This is all we found with him.
He had it folded up
in his pocket.
But this is...
I'm sorry, Connor didn't...
He... (sighs)

I can't remember the last time
that I heard him laugh,
but the two of them,
if you read these...
I think if you could take
ten minutes
and actually read
these emails...
I'm looking at them right now.
(sportscast playing on TV)
Zoe. Look what Evan sent us.
They're emails
from your brother.
I printed them out.
Oh. Take that, trees.
- How was school?
- Terrific.
All of a sudden,
people I've never met
want to be my best friend.
I'm the dead kid's sister,
didn't you know?
I'm sure they mean well.
I'm sure they don't.

No, Larry,
she needs her parents.
Enjoy the game.

Can I come in?
Oh.
You don't have to stop playing.
How was band?
You know, he-he talks about
you playing guitar,
in one of his emails, at
the spring concert last year.
Really?
(softly):
Yeah.
Does he, does he talk about
when he disappeared
for two days?
But then he called me and
asked me to come pick him up.
He wanted to come home,
but he wasn't ready
to talk to you yet,
so I took the bus all the way
downtown to get him,
and guess what.
All he really wanted was money.
And I gave it to him
because I was 12.
He was struggling.
How about the time he tried
to punch through my door,
screaming at
the top of his lungs,
saying he was gonna kill me
for no reason?
Is that email in there?
We're all grieving
in our own way.
You might consider reading
these when you're ready.
They might help
more than you think.

and if I... If I'm not here,
I'm just a phone call away
or an email or a text,
you know, whatever.
I know.
It says "Connor" on your cast.
Oh.
No, no, yeah. Um...
- You said you didn't know him.
- Sorry, I didn't.
Um...
It's in memory, so, like...
Y-You know,
kids are, like, um...
they're writing
his name on-on...
lockers and stuff like that.

Oh.
Um...
That's lovely.
You know, in memory.

Hmm.
Hey.
Tuesday. What are you doing?
When's the last time
we did Taco Tuesday?
That'd be great.
Really?
(chuckles):
Yeah.
ALANA: So the memorial's
really just an opportunity
for all of us to come together
as a community
and to remember Connor
and celebrate who he was.
Would you want to speak
or perform?
I didn't really know him.
I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
- Bye.
Want a wristband?
Oh, yes. Yeah. Okay.
Thank you.
You were friends
with him, right?
I saw him sign your cast
in the library,
and you started arguing
about something.
- Were you friends with him?
- We weren't close.
We presented together o-on
Huck Finn in the tenth grade,
but he probably didn't
tell you that. (chuckles)
Um, no, no, I didn't know.
I always really liked him.
It seemed like
he didn't really care
what anyone else thought, and...
(chuckles): I thought
that was pretty remarkable.
(chuckles)
Well, I'm putting together
a memorial for him
at school on Friday.
If you wanted to do something...
Oh. Um...
Sorry, I-I...
I-I probably w-would
rather not, if that's okay.
Yeah, sure.
If you change your mind...
just text me.

ALANA: Welcome to the first
official meeting
of The Connor Project.
(cheering)
Right?
Um, now, as you all know
from Evan's speech,
uh, Connor's favorite place
in the entire world
was the Autumn Smile
Apple Orchard.
I am beyond excited
to announce that,
in addition to our support
groups, we will be launching
a Kickstarter campaign to raise
$100,000 to reopen and redesign
Autumn Smile as the
Connor Murphy Memorial Orchard.
(applause)
Um, so to explain what we're
going to be asking of you,
I'm gonna turn things over
to our director
of global communications.
Thanks, Alana.
So great.
Our new website is now live.
If you have not yet read
the emails
between Evan and Connor...
oh, you're gonna want
to grab some tissues.
(vomiting)
LARRY: I swear, I've got
a Cal Ripken here somewhere.
Look at that, hmm?
The entire '96 team.
There's three Hall of Famers
on there.
- Wow.
- You get the right people,
baseball fans,
uh, you could raise
at least a few hundred bucks
for the orchard,
maybe a couple thousand.
Yeah, but...
I mean, you should, you should
probably keep all this stuff.
Oh, uh, it's just gonna
sit here gathering dust.
Uh, stiff as a board, isn't it?
Yeah.
Well, it's never been used.
Connor...
...he loved baseball.
When he was little.
First time I met him, uh...
Cynthia wasn't sure how the
kids would react, all right?
She was terrified.
And I was terrified.
I mean...
five minutes in...
(voice breaking): Connor's,
like, pulling my arm, uh...
"Come on, let's go play catch."
He...
(Larry sighs)
I bought that... I don't know...
two years ago.
I thought, you know,
maybe we could...
So stupid.
He was really lucky
to have a step...
...to have a dad like you.
Your dad must feel
pretty lucky to...
...have a son like you.
Yeah, he does.

You know, I-I saw
the strangest thing
- on-on Facebook yesterday.
- Really?
Um, somebody had a video
of you doing a speech.
About that boy, Connor Murphy.
How the two of you
climbed a tree together
at an orchard.
You told me that you didn't
know him, but in the speech,
you said that
he was your best friend.
Right, well...
...'cause that wasn't true.
Um...
When I said I didn't know him.
Mm.
I thought that
you broke your arm at-at work.
Okay, well, who do you think
drove me to urgent care
and-and waited there with me?
You were at work. You remember?
I couldn't even... You didn't,
you didn't answer your phone.
You-you told me
that your boss took you.
Well, so I lied, obviously.
So when were you planning
on telling me any of this?
When would I tell you exactly?
When are you even here?
- I'm here now.
- Okay.
You know, I-I-I talked
to Dr. Sherman, and he told me
- you've been skipping appointments.
- I missed one.
You know those aren't free.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm...
(sighs)
I'm so happy
you had a friend, sweetheart.
I'm sorry he's gone.
I just wish I'd known.
That speech you gave, it...
I don't even know what to say.
I'm...
I'm proud of you.
Thanks.

Just water.
- Just water? You're sure?
- Yeah. That's perfect.
Coming up.
(glass clinks)
(water running)
ZOE:
Where's your mom?
She works late on Fridays.
Oh. I wanted to meet her.
Yeah, that would've been great.
What's this?
Oh, it's just my mom is obsessed
with these college scholarship
essay contests.
I mean, I'd-I'd-I'd have to win
probably, like, all of them
to actually pay
for college, so...
Your parents,
they-they can't...?
Uh, not really.
I'm sorry.
Is your room upstairs?
Yeah. It's, um...
(sighs) Yeah.
Yeah, so it's, like, a pretty
standard sort of room, I guess.
So...
Hey. Oh, um...
actually, I meant
to tell you this before.
Um, so Alana and I
had a really good...
Um, we had a really good
meeting this morning,
and I think that...
y-you probably noticed,
um, that, uh, you know,
a lot of people were giving,
uh, during that first week,
which is definitely great,
but, um, it sort of slowed down
a bit, obviously.
But Alana and I
are really confident
that it's gonna
pick right back up.
I think it's just a m...
a matter of...
Can I talk to you
about something?
Yes.
(sighs) Uh...
The Connor Project is...
awesome.
It's-it's really, really cool.
Oh.
- Thank you.
- It's just that, my whole life,
everything has been about him.
And maybe the two of us...
...maybe we don't have to talk
about my brother all the time.
Maybe we can...
talk about other things.
I like you.

And it's not because you were

or because of

No.
I'm famous for doing that.

Mm-hmm.
Hi, honey.
CYNTHIA:
Come join us.
- I just put dinner in the oven.
- Hi.
(laughs)
She made me swear
to keep it a surprise.
- I'm surprised.
- (laughs)
Hi.
It's so nice
to finally meet you.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
Yeah, uh, great.
- It's great.
- (chuckles)
Come on, Evan. Sit.
I-I thought that you were
working tonight.
HEIDI: Cynthia called
and invited me for dinner,
so, you know, I'm playing hooky.
We were just discussing
how sneaky you and Connor were.
HEIDI: I had no idea that he
and Connor were even friends.
LARRY:
Oh, we were the same.
CYNTHIA: You know,
boys love their secrets.
Something smells good.
What's for dinner?
Oh, it's chicken Milanese,
your favorite.
Oh, actually his favorite is
my great-grandmother's
black beans.
Really?
CYNTHIA:
Well, he's the only one
that appreciates
my cooking, so...
- That's not true.
- Uh, another drop?
Oh, no, no. I'm-I'm fine.
Thank you.
Oh, um, fascinating story
about the wine.
It's from a vineyard in Napa,
and the entire growing process
from start to finish,
100% sustainable.
Is that right?
Not to mention,
it tastes good, too.
- Mm-hmm. It does.
- Mm.
You know,
I-I didn't realize, uh...
Cynthia and Larry
were telling me
that you spend
so much time here.
Yeah, I... you've been
working a lot, so...
Why did I think
you were at Jared's?
I-I don't know.
ZOE:
Evan was showing me
all of those scholarship
contests that you found.
It's really impressive.
Well, Evan is a great writer.
CYNTHIA:
Well, that does not
surprise me at all.
His English teacher last year
told me that he wrote
one of the best papers
she'd ever read on Sulu.
Is that right?
- It's Sula.
- What?
You said "Sulu." It's Sula.
LARRY:
Yeah, I believe Sulu's
a character on Star Trek.
(laughter)
My mistake.
So, speaking of scholarships...
Oh, right, uh...
Yeah, well, I guess...
(clears throat)
now's as good a time as any.
Uh...
Cynthia, do you want to...?
Hmm.
Well, um...
Zoe happened to mention that
Evan was having some difficulty
in terms of the
financial burden of college.
And Larry and I
started thinking,
and we've been fortunate enough
to set some money aside
for Connor.
Um, I'm good.
- I'm okay.
- Yeah.
Heidi, with your blessing,
we would like to give Evan
the money that we set aside
for our son
so he can fulfill his dreams.
Thank you so much...
but we're gonna be fine.
I don't have a lot of money,
but I-I do have some.
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to intimate...
No, no, I understand,
but, um, we do have money,
so I'm sorry you were under
the impression that we didn't.
And whatever money
we don't have,
Evan will either
make up for with a job
or he'll get a scholarship.
I don't want my son
to get the idea that it's okay
to rely on other people
for favors.
- Well, it's not a favor.
- No.
But as his mother,
I need to set that example.
You can't expect things
from strangers.
Oh, we're not strangers.
No, of course not.
But you're not family either.
Mom, just hold on.
No, I think
I better get to work,
see if I can grab a shift
now that I know
how concerned you are
about our finances.
Mom, will you please
come back inside?
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?
Will you just
come back inside, please?
They think you're their son,
these people.
They're not "these people."
They don't really know you.
Well, they like me.
They like me.
I know that that's very hard
for you to believe,
that they don't think I'm...
you know, that there's
something wrong with me,
that I need to be,
like, fixed, like you do.
- When have I ever said that?
- Oh, my God.
Mom, I-I have to go
to therapy, right?
I have to take drugs.
I have to...
There's-there's nothing
wrong with that.
There-There's nothing wrong
with needing help, honey.
Just stop.
I know that there is,
and I know that I'm a burden,
that I'm the worst thing
that ever happened to you,
and I just... well, I just
ruined your life, okay?!
No. You are the best thing.
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.
I'm sorry I can't give you
anything more than that.
It's not my fault
if other people can.
I'll see you at home.
(footsteps)
(car door opens, closes)
(engine starts)
(breathlessly):
Hi.
I'm so sorry.
I meant to be there yesterday.
Okay, well, we have two days
left, and we're $25,000 short.
Yeah, I just... Everything...
You're right. I know. I'm sorry.
Things have been
really busy, so...
I've been wondering something.
Mm-hmm?
Were you ever actually
friends with him?
What are you talking about?
Well, the thing about
the emails, it's just that,
like, you and Connor
keep talking about
climbing this tree together
in June.
Mm-hmm?
We were in school in June.
You didn't have a cast
until September.
Well, uh, you know what?
We probably just wrote down
the wrong date or something.
It's not just the emails, Evan.
You've missed, like,
three meetings in a row.
If I were his best friend,
I would be doing
everything I could to make sure
his dream of rebuilding
the orchard came true.
Okay.
Look, it's terrible
that people aren't giving
as much money
as we hoped they would.
It is, but-but it's not like
it's him.
You know what I mean?
It's-it's just...
it's an orchard, Alana.
♪ ♪
We have people watching us,
hoping...
praying that we can
prove Connor wrong.
And if the orchard is
just an empty promise,
all of those people will know
that Connor was right.
That no one cares.
(whispers):
Did you lie to me?
Did I lie to all these people?
Just go to your email.
Another email?
It's not...
it's not another email.
"Dear Evan Hansen..."
If we weren't friends,
then he wouldn't...
...he wouldn't have written
his note to me.
Look, only his family
have seen this, okay?
You can't, you can't show it
to anybody else, okay?
Alana.
Okay.

He wasn't right.
You know that, don't you?

I was never friends
with Connor Murphy.
I lied,
repeatedly,
to his family,
to Alana,
to all of you.
I'm not asking
for your forgiveness.
I don't deserve it.
But, um, please...
Connor's family
doesn't deserve your hatred.
I do.
I'm sorry.

You must start school
pretty soon.
Two more weeks.
When do you leave for college?
Um, actually I decided
to take a year off, so...
Uh, just try to save some money.
Get a job.
Uh... take some time.
So, I'm taking classes
at the community college.
I'll have credits to transfer
in the fall, so...
That's smart.
(chuckles):
Yeah. We'll see.
(Zoe sighs)
I always picture
you and Connor here.
Even though...
This is my first time.
It's nice.
Peaceful.
My parents come here
all the time.
We do picnics, like,
every weekend.
Lots of gluten-free sandwiches.
(chuckles)
It's helped them a lot,
actually.
Having this.
What I did...
...I can't even...
It's the worst thing
anyone can do.
(sighs)
I wish we could have met now.
Today.
For the first time.
Me, too.
I should probably...
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Of course.
Hey, can I just...
Can I just ask you...
Why did you want to meet here?
(sighs)
I wanted to be sure
that you saw this.
He really loved it here.

Because today,

today at least you're you.

that's enough.
So no matter how hard it gets,
even if it feels... impossible,
