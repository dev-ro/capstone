Need an Inflate A Date?
- No.
I'm here on business.
Do I look like I belong here?
Can't you see I don't belong here?
I can't see shit.
I'm sorry.
- I love you, brother. No sweat.
Hey, she got big
ones or little ones?
Big, very big, only she's not a she.
Shit! I need Scratch 'n' Sniff
on these things.
Keep scratching 'n' sniffing.
Doing business with
the loan shark?
Don't... I'm a
legitimate businessman.
I'm here to do business
with Mr Palazzi,
if he'll finance my deal.
Bank laughed at you?
- There was some laughter.
But that didn't bother me.
The spitting did.
At least the bank
had no dildoes laying around.
Lennihan!
The man will see you now.
That's me. I'm on. Bye.
Hey, my man, look cool,
take some shades.
I don't want no shades.
- Some smokes.
I don't want any. I'll keep them,
if that'll keep you off my ass.
Now, how do I look?
Buddy, how the fuck
should I know?
The best part is
for $50,000 down payment
I get the whole building
and open up my cineplex.
32 theatres, huh?
- 18 seats in each.
But that's not the
good part. Check this.
Dolby sound.
- I don't know anything about that.
It doesn't matter.
- I'll tell you what does matter.
If you get this cineplex
off the ground,
not that I care,
I will own 75% of the concessions...
and 100% of the
vending machines.
The interest on 50,000 is 100,000.
If you don't pay me 150,000
within one year,
we'll collect your collateral.
That's why I come to you.
I didn't go to E F Hutton.
I don't have any collateral.
You're standing on your collateral.
- My legs?
John has something for you.
- John?
Now, there's a little
favour we want.
Our business has
been experiencing...
some setbacks recently.
There's a lot of heat on us
and we're being watched closely.
So we'd appreciate it if you'd take
this package to California for us.
Something for the little lady?
Lennihan, I've got
some advice for you.
Don't be a jerk-off.
But I am a jerk-off.
I'm certainly not...
a bagman. Do I look
like a bagman?
The best in the country.
I will deliver these
diamonds for you.
You've no problem with that?
- No.
I'm a little tense.
I've recently quit smoking.
I'm gonna start again.
It helps relieve tension.
I'm so tense you could open
beer bottles with my asshole.
I mean, I am tense.
I'm talking tense.
What the hell's that?
- He's got a fucking wire!
What?
- Police! Drop 'em!
Nobody move!
- Don't try it!
Jeez!
Don't move!
You're a cop!
You're not even a blind cop!
What are you...?
- You set me up.
I didn't. I thought
this guy was a blind...
pervert. I didn't
know he was a cop.
You're dead!
I'm dead? No, you're
the one that's dead.
'Cause they caught
you with a bag of...
diamonds and
money. Red-handed!
Holy shit! Can we talk?
Kevin.
You explained
everything's a misunderstanding?
I'm gonna buy you the
greatest dinner...
I tried everything.
I didn't make a plea,
I begged for mercy.
But you're gonna
have to do a year.
All right, let's go.
- A year?
But this is my first
offence. Couldn't you...
get me probation?
I'll do social work.
How about this?
I'll cook for runaway teenage girls.
I never said a word about
your hare-brained schemes.
Even when I put $5,000
in your offshore shopping mall.
I thought that was foolproof.
I had to do it. I needed
the down payment...
or I was gonna lose everything.
But why these guys?
The Feds have wanted
Palazzi for years.
Then I should get a reward.
My stupidity got him busted.
You're sick!
- Lennihan! Wait a minute, Harris.
Ten years, no parole,
'cause of you.
I'll be in the machine shop...
with my associates
waiting for you.
You're dead, Lennihan.
See you in the shower.
Watch the shoulder.
- Let's go. Move it. Move it!
Mr Lennihan, please rise.
I must make sure your plea
is voluntary and you understand...
the consequences of
your guilty plea.
Are you taking any drugs...
that might impair your judgement
in entering this plea?
Are you suffering
any mental illnesses?
That's it.
What?
- Plead insanity.
You're not crazy,
just pathologically irresponsible.
You know that and I know that.
Did you understand the question?
Mr Lennihan,
did you understand, you pig fart?
Damn you,
did you understand the question?
Come here. Your Honour,
look at this man,
he stole my money!
He wanted us to invest in offshore
supermarkets. They sank.
Try to talk to a judge like that!
Come here.
He's been under stress.
- Stress!
You'd be under stress, too.
You're humping my wife in my car!
And you, you slut,
with a mask over your face.
You can't mask us.
You've got brown babies at home.
I'm looking for justice!
- Bailiff.
There's justice and
injustice. I'm part...
of the justice because I'm the just.
I'm just just.
- Bailiff.
Yeah!
Everybody get away from him.
My client!
Yeah!
- Order!
That's not bad.
Your Honour, my client seems
to have had a breakdown.
This is ludicrous.
The court must show compassion.
All right, Mr Kline, I'll
remand your client...
for psychiatric
observation for 21 days.
But if his insanity
is not established conclusively,
he'll start his
sentence immediately.
Now, what do you see there?
My first grade teacher
after I cut her throat,
the bitch.
That's me drinking her blood.
Then I put my hand in it and made...
a print on the wall.
Walked through it.
Thank you.
I didn't think I'd ever see her again.
Do you want me to
call security again?
Oh, no, please, not yet.
Mr Lennihan.
Please can I keep this card?
- No, I don't think so.
Just a minute. Just a minute!
Thank you, Mr Lennihan.
- I'm crazy, right?
Sit down. It's hospital rules.
- Yes, I know.
So?
I think she's gonna
send me to prison.
I did everything we talked about.
She didn't buy it.
I thought we had her this time.
This lady is tough.
She's seen a lot of
scams. We have to...
invent a new approach to insanity.
What do you mean? I was trying
to wank off. I believe she was, too.
Police chopper 43
to Empire General Hospital.
Are you sure it's safe
to land on the island?
Yes, but head back a.s.a.p.
Storm's building fast.
Hurricane Sam is
roaring up the coast...
and heading straight
for the Big Apple.
City offices have closed
and traffic advisories are in effect.
Watch your leg.
This storm is not hanging around.
Hey, Maggie.
- What's this?
Stucky, Joe. Murder. Drugs.
He's a real animal.
Kicked the shit out
of him in his cell.
Put him in the radio room.
We got a line waiting at X-ray.
Home, home on the range
You're wasting money on horses.
The bread's in the stock market.
With the possible exception
of Monty's Dream in the fifth.
I'm home.
- Hi, Lennihan.
I got you something.
- Thanks. Wow! Who is she?
Hey, this way.
What did the shrink say?
- Strike three.
They won't let you
stay or let me go.
They'll let you out soon.
You still think you're black, right?
Say, get down, blood.
- "Get down, blood."
You've no problem.
You'll be home with this guy.
You're fucking crazy, man.
Bouncy, bouncy.
Go, Yale!
- Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.
Watch that wave.
What happened here?
What's going on?
Question is, do you
want to live or die?
If they let you out,
you gonna shake...
hands with Palazzi? Remember?
I don't have to remember
if I want to live.
You think I'm crazy?
Good cookies, right?
Wallpaper, curtains,
this would be just like home.
Hi, Maggie.
Rachel, Chambers is
looking for you.
Traffic was impossible.
- Is he on the rag?
Pen?
He's hassling me about everything.
He's stressed
about putting me in charge.
It won't be easy tonight.
- A hurricane won't spoil my début.
You're late. We've a lot to go over.
Mr Chambers, could
Julie and Karen...
stay here for the night?
Overtime?
- This won't be an average night.
Every night is average.
Why no requests...
when it's slow to go
home without pay?
When is it slow?
Box, the dog is on my bed.
The pillow! That's my pillow.
He's just guarding it.
- Guarding the damn pillow?
He's marking his territory.
- I'll mark his territory.
Get your ass off my bed, Fido!
Fido, Fido, Fido, Fido, here!
He ain't no bad dog.
- He tried to eat me.
Out to lunch, man. Out there!
Staffing chart looks fine,
but who's this Dr Slattery?
He's running the emergency room.
Worked for me at Woodhurst.
This'll be a tough weekend.
Let's see how you do.
Now...
Didn't Maggie have a point
about those extra nurses?
A good administrator
doesn't take their...
staff's point of
view. You know that?
Well, yes, of course.
Yeah.
No luck with the walkie-talkies.
Let's send them back.
To Pic 'n' Save?
Trouble in Psychiatric. Lennihan's
got them climbing the walls again.
I'll be right up.
I'll take care of it.
Relax. I'll deal with
it on my way out.
And I'll see you Monday morning.
- Have a nice weekend.
Dr Slattery was gonna
stop by before...
he started. Must've
got caught in traffic.
Rachel, run this hospital.
Bite him!
Break it up in here. Calm down.
It's a territorial dispute.
The big dog took the
little dog's toy.
Lennihan, is that
the best you can do?
After what you pulled
on that judge,
I was hoping for
more entertainment.
Hoffman already sent
me her evaluation.
You're off to jail in the morning.
Don't try peeing on my leg.
That won't change my mind.
Give him a locked private room,
so he doesn't disturb
the real patients.
Oh, shit.
Leave him alone.
He'll die in prison.
They're going to kill him.
Box, take it easy. Just calm down.
This is none of your business.
Get back to bed.
Make me.
You're going to make
him go to prison.
You going to make me go to bed,
motherfucker? Is that it?
You ain't gonna
make me do nothing.
You ain't gonna make nobody
do nothing, motherfucker!
'Cause we're on strike.
- Yeah.
We're on strike! We're on strike!
Excuse me. Excuse me!
I am touched by your concern
for Mr Lennihan,
but unless you return
to your bunks,
I'll shut this ward...
and transfer you all...
to a prison for the
criminally insane.
Not Dannemora?
- Exactly.
They'll eat these fruits alive there.
You heard Mr Box,
so everyone who...
wants to stay here,
return to your bunks.
No. Nobody move.
- Don't!
Nobody has to go anywhere.
Box, don't make it bad for yourself.
It's gonna be all right.
I fucked up.
I'm going to penitentiary. It's OK.
No, fuck that. You
ain't going nowhere.
Nobody is going nowhere.
What are you trying to pull?
- Lights! What happened?
He's shutting down the ward!
- Man, you'll all die!
Come on.
- We've got to stop this.
You don't leave,
you're dead tomorrow.
Shit's on now!
Come on.
- Let's raid the pharmacy.
They've got nurses with big tits.
- They're taking Lennihan away.
We can't let these guys
loose in the hospital.
The city's partially blacked out.
Our grid is wiped out.
Great. No power on the island.
Nowhere to go but up.
Give me a light.
There's the emergency generator
on schedule.
That generator
only puts out half the power.
A lot of the hospital
still has no juice.
Dr Randy...
Tommy Pinto fell off the roof.
Why was he up there
in a hurricane?
Chambers sent him
up. Where is he?
Gone for the weekend.
What do you need?
- What happened?
I fell off the roof.
- Move your legs? Your neck?
Yeah.
- Get him a lateral c-spine.
Call my wife, will you?
Where's our ER doc?
I can't do this diagnosis by myself.
How do I get hold of you?
I need some more picks.
You think I'm gonna give you a...
forwarding address?
I'm outta here.
Go to Chambers' office,
pick up your files.
Upstairs. Make a right.
- Right. Chambers.
Don't forget about the OR.
Chambers' lab!
- It's got its own generator.
Chambers spared no expense.
That's why...
Anything else you need?
Bring back the
girls you sent home.
Oh, shit!
- Get me some flashlights.
There's no oxygen pumping.
- Where are the O² tanks?
Just go over there. Where's Doris?
Doris. Where did she go?
- Shit. Stucky!
Why should the generator work?
Nothing else does.
Stucky!
- Get maintenance on the phone.
What phone? It just went dead.
- Oh, God.
Stucky, you clown!
I'm gonna twist your head off.
What's the story
with the generator?
Checking it out now.
Great.
I haven't even got Tommy's X-rays.
How long's it going to take?
- Get off my fucking case.
When it's fixed I'll let you know.
The generator was working before,
so they'll get it working again.
The ER doctor's
gonna be here soon,
so let's get on with the work...
and deal with the emergencies
as they arise.
Dr Slattery?
- You got me.
Edward Slattery?
- Edward Slattery?
Thank God. I'm Rachel Atwood,
Arthur's assistant.
I know the conditions
aren't what you...
expected, but I'm
doing the best I can.
I'll find the disaster manual...
and see if I can get
some information.
This book is so old,
there's a chapter on leeches.
I'll have to use my judgement.
I guess so.
- What's this?
Lennihan, Kevin.
Oh, Chambers took...
care of that. So
let's go, Dr Slattery.
Go? Where?
To ER.
You've got a herd waiting for you.
Start without me and
I'll be right down.
I'm not an MD, I'm
an administrator.
We've got to go now.
I've got to scrub up.
- Dr Slattery, are we ready?
Would you call me Eddie, please?
I'll call you Rachel.
Eddie, Rachel?
- OK.
Did Chambers mention
I might not be staying very long?
I had other things I had to do.
I'm going to other hospitals.
And bring some plaster, we've got...
a broken leg. Can
you take care of it?
There's Maggie, the charge nurse.
Tell her you're here.
Check the life packs.
We don't know if
they were recharged.
Put down that pillow...
and take this lantern
to the drug room.
Take the pillow.
You have two hands.
I'm done stitching.
I need someone to help dress her.
Go to the trauma room...
and help Dr Joffe
with the dressing.
Excuse me, I have an emergency.
Dr Foster, what are you doing?
We don't intend to
run an operating...
room by candlelight, do we?
I've rescheduled all
elective surgery...
until the day after tomorrow.
Deploy the OR nurses
as you see fit.
Oh, boy, that was a close one.
Aren't you going to
help out down here?
You are standing
on a malpractice time bomb.
I don't intend to be around
when it explodes.
There's nothing
wrong with my head.
You haven't seen it
from this angle.
I wanna go home.
I gotta put the
top on my Mercedes.
What should I do with
all these people?
Don't admit them to our hospital.
Send 'em home.
Hey, you can't take that.
That's my ambulance.
I'm outta here!
I'm out!
Shit! Oh, shit.
Shit!
No. No!
Stop. Stop!
The causeway's out.
- The causeway's out?
Yeah.
- Who are you?
Dr Slattery. Who are you?
- Dr Foster.
We've got the same first name.
How about a ride back
to the hospital?
Causeway's out.
Give me more slack out there.
This is a great idea, Dr Joffe.
- Young Dr J's full of great ideas.
How many headlights
do you have?
20.
You left your
stethoscope at home?
Thank you for the ride.
Hey, Doc, where's my ambulance?
I got it washed.
- Dr Slattery, what happened?
Dr Slattery?
- What's your problem?
What happened?
- The causeway collapsed.
The ambulance drowned.
- Who is he?
I thought you were
treating patients.
I was.
Then I saw the storm and I knew
the best thing to do was evacuate.
Evacuate?
- Yeah, that was my diagnosis.
Shouldn't they drive
the ambulances?
Yeah. They should.
What's your name?
Dr Joffe.
Barely "Dr". Left
school 3 months ago.
Three months?
I've got haemorrhoids
older than that.
You send people out
in this weather...
without ascertaining the risk?
Don't you realise
medicine is hands-on?
You should've went into law.
You tell 'em!
- I wasn't saying...
Dr Slattery.
Dr Slattery.
Dr Slattery. ER's this way.
Chambers is probably sitting
in front of the fire with a Scotch.
He loves Scotch.
- I should call him.
No, don't!
- Right, the phones are dead.
Here's what we have for starters.
A roofer who fell in the storm.
He hasn't been X-rayed.
A guy struck by lightning.
A regular who thinks
this is a clinic.
Auto accident, with contusions.
A possible labour.
No husband, six kids, all here.
Broken leg in the cast room.
And we need a doctor
for the detox ward.
They're screaming
for their medicine.
I can't fake being a doctor.
I couldn't fake being a lunatic.
This is easier.
None of them know
what they're doing.
What's a doctor do?
- Diagnose the clap.
Then give 'em a shot.
Somebody'll recognise
I'm not Slattery.
Nobody keeps track of
these emergency...
doctors. They're moonlighters.
They blow in, work some shifts,
make their money and disappear.
You're perfect for the job.
Only if Chambers doesn't show up.
Go to Psycho and check it out.
- I'm a doctor?
You're a doctor.
- I'm a doctor.
Doctor, we need
those dispositions.
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?
The problem
with the medical profession?
Too much buck passing.
- No shit.
You depend on me.
I'm moonlighting.
I do the business and I'm gone.
Depend on yourselves.
You got good minds.
You're brilliant!
Screen those patients for me.
Nurse, help him out.
Give me your recommendations.
And remember what
Hippocrates said.
Now, go to work.
Go to work. Let's go. Work, work!
One more time, Chambers.
What did you do with the lights?
You always want
to keep us in the dark.
Maybe the whole
city's blacked out.
Yeah, right, sure.
Suffering delusions of grandeur.
Give me the radio and I'll find out.
What are you going to do?
Call in the SWAT team?
Are we going to sit here all night?
We're gonna sit here forever,
just as long as I have
my hands around...
your scrawny, pecker neck.
Nobody is gonna send
us to Dannemora.
Shut up, fuckhead!
Oh, Dr Slattery, please!
What's the problem?
Have you tried prune juice?
- Of course.
The last time I went was a week
and it wasn't such a good one.
Warm baths does the trick for me.
You'll be fine.
She's already taking suppositories
and nothing's moving.
She can't do it by herself.
We'll have to do a
manual disimpaction.
Get the manual.
What's that for?
- Oy, not this again!
What's the matter?
You gotta be kidding. Dr Joffe!
Dr Joffe! Dr Joffe, get over here.
It's an emergency. Take care of it.
He'll wish he went to law school.
I need more penicillin.
- Coming right up.
What is it?
No diagnosis yet.
She hasn't been examined.
You haven't examined her yet?
And you have magic hands?!
What are you going to do
with these magic hands?
Wash them. They were just up
Mrs Nussbaum's magic butt.
I've given you all
the glamorous jobs.
Examine this patient for me.
I have lots of things to do.
Yes, sir.
Joffe.
- Sir?
Get out here.
- But, sir...
Now. You're beginning
to disgust me.
Go wash your magic hands.
Get your magic ass outta here.
Under the curtain!
Sorry, sir.
- This is important. Quick.
What a cute coat.
- Thank you very much.
What seems to be the trouble?
- It hurts all over.
Here and here.
And especially here.
- Doctor'll make it all better.
Stetho... stetheth...
Cool off. Make it nice.
What do you hear?
- Oh, I hear...
I hear a little tiny
voice and it's saying,
"Eddie, you're one
lucky son of a bitch."
You know, I just love
a dedicated man in medicine.
They give so much
and it makes me...
want to give them something back.
Yes, dedicated. That's it.
I'm a dedicated doctor.
I'm a dedicated
doctor, a good doctor.
This is my best day of doctoring.
I love caring men.
- Oh, I care.
My cynical friend said doctors...
just tell people they
have the clap...
and give 'em a shot. Imagine that!
You wouldn't have to tell me that.
I know.
- Because that's why I'm here.
Yes.
- I already have the clap.
Dr Joffe!
What the hell are you doing?
Building a wall?
No, this is the latest technique.
When the cast is real big,
the bone sets harder.
You're gonna like
this. This is good.
I'd like you to do me
a favour, however,
when you take this cast off.
I'd like my ring back.
It's in here, see.
This is good. Oh, this
is gonna set good.
You can hear it.
Dr Slattery, can I
see you a moment?
Dr Foster, take over for me,
there's an emergency.
Try this for size.
Excuse me, Doctor.
- This could be serious.
Excuse me.
- More questions? Just go away.
You have the pressure...
Backwards!
No wonder. It's an '82 model.
They should've recalled these.
Anything else I can do for you?
- Yes, Doctor.
That's the woman
who needs treatment.
She's her cousin.
They could have something that...
runs in the family.
You never know.
Have them both X-rayed.
She says what's wrong
is her husband...
left her and it hurts all over.
X-rays won't show anything.
- It won't hurt.
Look. See?
Excuse me.
What did he say?
He said my husband
is no good anyway.
And that he thinks I have a nice...
...you know, ass.
And that maybe
we'll go dancing tomorrow night.
Oh, hey! Shit! How the hell?!
Look out!
Goddamn it!
Can ten have something...?
Where's the emergency power?
- They're restoring it.
Four nurses for eight patients.
- How many do you need?
I'm trying to keep
people alive by hand.
I could use three per bed.
Oh, God. Don't worry.
I'll get you everybody I can spare.
We've got a patient with a DVT.
Then he threw a PE.
He could have an MI.
- That can be serious.
Don't I need a second opinion?
Some haven't had a
first opinion yet.
Is that why your parents struggled
to send you to school?
My parents are wealthy.
Would they be interested
in a cineplex?
$50,000 down payment...
- What?
Your opinion is as
good as anyone else's.
Dr Joffe, I'm counting
on you today.
Don't let me down.
Thank you, sir.
- You're OK.
What are you doing?
Letting a first-year...
intern make a diagnosis
like that alone?
That's an invitation to litigation.
Exactly like Blowfield
vs. St Jude's.
$3 million settlement!
What are you trying to pull?
Who are you?
What is the matter?
- This guy's gone crazy.
Your emergency generator?
You can forget about it.
You'd need a miracle
to get juice in that by the morning.
Morning? We have
people being kept...
alive by hand in ICU.
That can't go on.
What do you want us
to do? We've been...
after Chambers for
months about it.
I didn't hear any...
People are gonna die here tonight.
She only wants to
know what it costs.
You goddamn people
have been running...
this hospital into the ground.
Pointing the finger at Rachel,
that's gonna fix the generator?
We need people in ICU?
- We can't spare anybody.
We'll get people from elsewhere.
- That's easy to say.
It's easy to do, too. Follow me.
Eddie, what are you doing?
Just a minute.
Rachel, I am a master
of persuasion.
Eddie.
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?
We need your help.
- What is he doing?
I've been here five hours.
What's going on?
Louis! This is our
head orderly, Louis.
I want you all to get to know him.
Remember when you were kids
and had your temperature taken?
What is he talking about?
Well, tonight's gonna be your turn
to help your fellow man.
Listen to the doctor.
He must be from
some ambulance-chasing law firm.
You can't have patients...
working in a
hospital, can you? No.
I'm your doctor.
I'm gonna prescribe
for you exercise.
It's good for the
cardiovascular system.
It'll help you. You'll walk.
Listen to the doctor.
If anything happened
we'd be liable.
I don't have any choice.
This is anarchy.
- Do I?
Especially you. You
need the exercise...
most. You're getting up. Come on.
I'm no doctor.
- I know, but you need exercise.
Watch the kids.
Come on up. Up.
- Thank you.
Thanks, Eddie.
- My pleasure.
Get me outta here. I can't take this.
This way, please.
Doctor, the ICU is this way.
- Sorry. Just follow Louis.
Dr Slattery, where are you going?
- ICU.
No, you're an
emergency room doctor.
Eddie, the orderly
will take them up.
Eddie?
Tommy Pinto's feeling
tingling in his legs.
I'm worried.
What do you think it might be?
Spinal injury, but
he needs a CAT scan.
What happened to the cat?
- There's no power.
There are lights on the helipad.
- They got their own generator.
No wonder he gets big bucks.
- Who's gonna move it?
How about the men in Detox?
They're just sitting around.
Beating their pugs. I'll get on it.
- I'll take care of it.
You can't. They'll
never listen to you.
Administration is my job.
Miss Atwood.
- She won't listen.
She has no idea what she's doing.
We're talking a class
action suit against...
this hospital, and
you're encouraging it.
What kind of gypsy
doctor are you?
Is that a formal accusation
or libellous hearsay?
I have a lawyer on call 24 hours
to take care of nitwits like you.
He'll be on you like white on rice.
- I wasn't suggesting...
I wasn't.
- I accept your apology. This time.
I'm sorry.
- Help Joffe with Tommy Pinto.
Move your ass.
- Dr Slattery.
I'm going to the
bathroom. I don't need...
a second opinion. I
know how to hold it.
Do I need a second opinion?
- No.
He doesn't need a second opinion.
Mr Stucky.
Jackson, here for the cure?
Yeah. They let you out of prison?
I scammed those
suckers in the joint...
with my leg-is-falling-off bullshit.
How do I get out of here?
- I don't know.
Attention, please.
- What do you want?
You know the hospital.
- I need my meth.
I'll get you all you want.
This involves you as well.
- Get me off the island.
Now, come on, hard-ass, let's go.
This is out of the ordinary
and a highly unusual request,
but this is a highly
unusual situation.
We really do need the manpower.
I thought this was
supposed to be a drug...
programme, not a job programme.
Ain't that right, fellas?
So just give us our dope...
...dope.
Well...
My girl likes to party all the time
Take it easy,
before you wear this fucking stick.
Tell 'em again. They
don't hear you.
You'll wear the fucking stick.
You woke him up from his nap.
We got a programme...
- I got a programme, too.
I got good news and bad news.
The good news is I
got the methadone.
OK, OK, what is the bad news?
You're gonna have to work for it.
- That's terrible news.
Rachel asked for your help
and you laughed.
I'm not taking no jaw-jacking.
I'm gonna split.
I didn't come here to
work, but to relax.
I need you to work.
I can't work.
- Praise the Lord, he can't work.
We're junkies, not flunkies.
Wrong. Thought you had to piss,
but you had to shit.
Listen, do we have a deal?
Say yes, everybody.
- Yes!
We'll do the work.
You've made
an important career decision.
The junkies on the go!
The junkies on the go!
Hi ho for methadone
The junkies on the go!
Two, three, four, push it down!
Keep your end up, man.
Out of my face, asshole.
- Don't talk to the doctor like that.
No, no. I can give
you shock treatment.
Clean your brains
out if you got any.
Now, keep it up
and see what happens. Rachel.
Yeah.
If someone needed to
get off the island...
fast, say they were
gonna get killed...
...they were sick,
could they use that boat?
Yeah, I have the key.
But you can't do...
anything when it's like this.
Not like this, but when it's nice.
Yeah. It's possible.
- Good to know. Let's go.
Dannemora? Who said
anything about
Dannemora? Where do I sign?
Lights out at ten, cable TV,
sports and dirty movies.
Sodas whenever we want.
- Nurses with bigger tits.
A wonderful idea!
Well, that should be no problem.
Anything else? No? Terrific.
Now, don't sign this
if you don't want to.
Now, if I can just
have that radio back.
What did you do with Lennihan?
- You all saw what happened.
You sent him to Palazzi
or to medical experiments.
We're next! We're next!
We're next! We're next!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I can see you're too smart for me.
I'll level with you.
Lennihan was an
undercover inspector...
for the Board of Health.
The Board of Health.
You're just too good, Chambers.
You really are.
- What do we do now?
What do we do?
We gag that maggot
before I rip his lying lips off.
You could puke a buzzard
off a gut wagon.
Yeah!
You're our hero.
- I am?
Yeah.
- Way to go.
That was great, Jack.
My toaster's on the
fritz. You can fix it.
Your oven, too.
We're not out of the woods yet.
- Right.
Dr Slattery, someone here says he...
works for you. You'd
better go see him.
I'm busy.
Show me where the Demerol is
and I'll medicate my own ass.
Get me Dr Joffe.
- Good luck.
You're supposed to be working.
- Don't waste your time.
Help those who can be saved.
Just throw me in the bed
and forget about me.
And to make sure my last days are...
comfortable, keep me
highly medicated.
You know my condition.
- Yes.
You've got a severe case
of full-of-shit-ness.
I'm confused.
What's that in layman's terms?
It means I'm gonna check this out.
No, no, I told you, Doc. You don't...
What is that?
I don't like how that sounds.
- No shit.
I don't like that one, either.
- That makes two of us.
Did you just experience
a sharp pain?
No, a blow job. What do you think?
How's the patient?
- Can I vote?
I'm feeling groovy. It's
just I can't do that...
kind of work because of my hernia.
Dr Joffe, would you check
this man out for a hernia, please?
Great, another one of those
glamour jobs. OK, drop trou.
OK.
Cough.
He seems fine.
Squeeze harder.
Sometimes it's inside.
Cough.
- I am coughing, man.
I'll cough up my lung
if you'll have this guy let go.
Harder.
- But, sir...
I know it's unorthodox, but we're...
trying to save a life.
Give it a good...
I'll schedule immediate surgery.
Yes, I'll have to
check these boys out...
from the inside.
No, we don't! I wanna work!
Dr Joffe, he's cured!
Rachel, Dr Joffe, that'll be all.
And Joffe...
- I know, sir. Wash my hands.
I never had any doubts about you.
Even though your
colleagues thought...
What did my colleagues thought?
You hung in there
when the shit hit the fan.
That's because I'm a shit-in-the-fan
dodger from way back.
I got into medicine late in life.
What did you do before?
- I sold real estate.
I made investments.
Property. Land.
I was doing good. Had
lots of investors.
Everything was
going OK. One day,
I looked at myself in the mirror.
I said, "This ain't the life for you no...
more." Then I went
to medical school.
Which school?
- Nearby.
What's it like running a hospital?
Being in charge of everything
in the hospital, like the food...
and the strawberry desserts,
jellos and things.
I'd like to talk about them.
- Yes.
I know you run a hospital,
but I want them jellos, OK?
I haven't had the chance yet.
Tonight's my try-out for the job.
Rachel, you're doing
a great job running this hospital.
And you're a lot
prettier than Chambers.
Thank you.
- I gotta... I gotta fix food, coffee.
Miss Atwood.
This is Mary in ICU. It must be
110 without air conditioning.
We gotta do something.
- I'll take care of it, Mary.
Don't panic.
You fix the sandwiches,
I'll go to ICU.
OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.
You goofing off again? I'm trying
to mobilise everybody for ICU.
We're putting the helicopter in the...
lobby, blow air up
the elevator shafts.
You're gonna be all right. Say "ah".
To the lobby, Louis.
Hup, two, three...
Can it get through the door?
- It's foolproof.
I'm gonna take a
sandwich. Foolproof!
Pull! Pull!
Come on, we almost got it up.
Put your backs into it.
One, two, three, pull!
Oh, my God! You said you could...
put it through the
front door. Foolproof!
It's close. I've just got to get it
by the elevator shaft,
and I blow air
throughout the hospital.
These guys are gonna help.
All I have to do is
get it up the steps.
Right, men? You
gonna give it a try?
One more time.
One, two, three, pull!
You did your best.
Let's get them to ICU.
Drop what you're doing
and follow me to ICU, OK?
Eddie?
- Anybody know about choppers?
I am an expert in choppers.
The "Slicks", the Sikorskys,
all the Hueys:
The A, the B, the C, the D model,
Airwolf, Blue Thunder.
And this one, the Huey 500 D?
I know it backwards and forwards.
- You wouldn't bullshit me?
I wouldn't shit you.
- Let's see. Get in.
Well, I was a chopper mechanic
in the big Asian vacation.
Never got off the ground.
Fear of heights.
But if you put somebody
behind that...
stick, I can definitely
show you how.
We've no more time.
We've got to evacuate the ICU.
Any volunteers?
Bring it on up. Easy now, easy.
Too much left pedal.
Ease your cyclic forward.
My what?
- Your steering stick.
A little more collective.
Your up and down stick.
My dick?
Hope he knows what he's doing.
No sweat. He told me he owns one.
OK, that's it. Easy, up, up, up.
It's a piece of cake.
Slow. Oh, shit,
they're dusting your ass with 50s.
Get off the trees!
- What?!
Down! Down!
Are you freaking out down there?
- Rocket fire! Evade! Evade!
Evade what? This ain't Vietnam!
- To the right.
Are you fucking crazy?!
- Shit, they blew up my stash.
Oh, God, I'm out of drugs.
You stoned fuckhead,
how do I land?
Don't land! Back to base.
This pad's too fucking hot.
What?
- Take it up.
Don't land.
- The war's over, you fuckhead!
I'm gonna die in this motherfucker!
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't land! Don't land. Don't.
Way to go!
- All right!
Thank God!
I'm going to grab his heart
and pull it out of his ass.
You get the Distinguished
Flying Cross.
You got something for me?
You!
Help! Help!
It's gonna be fine. Yes,
it's gonna be fine.
He's having a fit.
It worked.
- Terrific.
I'm gonna wake up any minute
and laugh my head off.
You can't go to sleep now.
We've lots to do.
I've got to fix the
generator, bail out the...
basement. But your
troops look wasted.
You go up to ER.
I'll take care of my troops.
OK, thank you.
- OK.
I'll be right back, Tommy.
- Don't forget about me.
Well?
- These X-rays are meaningless.
You want an artist's sketch.
- No. A CAT scan.
We can't do a scan.
There's no power upstairs.
Tommy Pinto has an epidural
haematoma of the spine.
The longer we wait,
the greater the risk of paralysis.
He's jumping to conclusions.
- No, I'm not.
We don't have the
proper information.
What else could it be?
It could be... Let's
say for argument's...
sake he needs an operation.
We don't have an operating room,
do we?
We don't?
- Of course not. There's no power.
It's inconceivable to perform
that kind of delicate surgery...
here in the emergency
room, isn't it?
Would you?
- No. I never have.
The air's filled with
bacteria, germs.
It's not antiseptic.
We can't expose...
the central nervous
system to a lawsuit.
What if we can't restore power,
what if there's complications...?
Wait!
- What are you talking about?
Doctors, act like doctors.
What's wrong with you?
Hey! Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is going on?
Tommy?
- Please take a look at Tommy.
I know what I'm talking about.
He won't even look.
It's not my domain.
It's your domain.
See? No!
Yes, it is.
- I'm only the intern.
I'm a surgeon. I never
talk to patients...
until after... before...
You have to go in there.
I...?
- Oh, Dr Slattery! Dr Slattery!
No, listen. I'll go
in. I'll look at him...
...alone.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Doc, how you doing?
So, how you doing, Tommy Pinto?
OK. So, what's the story here?
The story is,
you should've used a ladder.
Tommy, are you a
diabetic? A diabetic?
No.
- What's your favourite flavour?
Red.
- Shoot! That's mine, too.
They just don't put
enough reds in here.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Doc, can you look at my legs
'cause I can't feel nothing.
That's bad, isn't it?
Well, no, it's... Hey, no.
It's not as bad as you think it is.
Put a heating pad on
it and it'll be OK?
You really are a lucky man.
You could've fallen
off a roof anywhere.
You fell off here at the hospital.
There's good people
around to take...
care of you, make sure
you're all right.
So you're gonna be fine.
You'll be fine.
Hey, Doc, you're
not bullshitting me,
are you?
Well, what do you think?
Eddie, what's up?
You see, I've been
getting a free ride.
If that man doesn't
get an operation,
he may be crippled for
the rest of his life.
I can't keep this bullshit up.
- You have to.
I know how worried you are.
- You think I'm doing a job.
I'm not a doctor.
- Listen to me.
Every time
we've been up against the wall,
you made us believe
anything was possible.
Anything is possible?
- Yes.
And you made me believe it, too.
Yeah, I could... I could try.
Yeah, let's try it.
Did we get that box of Nurolon?
- Right there.
The anaesthesia
equipment is working.
Check this beat.
It's nice stuff. It's great.
Here we go, Dr Foster.
- Very romantic.
You expect me to perform surgery
under these conditions?
Who are you people?
You are incompetent.
Everything you've...
done has jeopardised this hospital.
I will no longer be party...
to your criminal
behaviour. Good day.
Dr Foster. Dr Foster.
Why talk to her like
that? She's trying...
to help. I'll break your fingers.
I'll leave one to shove
up your pompous...
ass. Can you operate in there?
If something happened,
I'd have no defence.
You'd leave a man downstairs...
'cause you're afraid
you'll get sued?
Are you a doctor or a bureaucrat?
Why did we go into medicine
in the first place?
Since becoming a
doctor, I've watched...
the medical profession go to hell.
We're treated no better
than fly-by-night...
mechanics or housebuilders.
If the customer isn't happy,
they haul us into court.
Where's the deference, the trust?
- The trust? You're a penis head.
What?
- We're doctors.
People say, "Help me, please."
And we help 'em. That's power.
You'd let lawyers
scare you out of that?
We got the greatest
jobs in the world.
We can park anywhere we want.
Driveways, loading
zones. No tickets.
Aisle seats at the theatre.
- There you go.
Is there a fire?
- What are you doing?
I have no choice.
Where are we going?
- Chambers' research lab.
What's that?
- Mutiny!
What are you doing?
- Oh, my God!
Nice shot. Watch your foot.
Is this the cafeteria?
I suppose you think that's funny.
This is criminal behaviour.
This is breaking and entering.
Can we light
the OR with this generator?
I don't see why not.
My God! What is
Arthur going to say?
...Arthur!
- This is Arthur's baby.
No, this is Arthur's baby.
This is an emergency
I must deal with.
Stop! Miss Atwood,
you're throwing...
your career out the window.
What's your problem?
- It's a risk I must take. Right?
Right.
- No! Stop!
Miss Atwood! No!
What are we doing?
What about it, Dr Foster?
Can you perform the operation?
Oh, what a mess!
We have power. Can you?
- Anything to get out of here.
Great, I'll get it moved.
Dr Slattery, I'd be pleased...
to have you assist
me in the surgery.
Dr Slattery?
- Yes.
We have to go.
- I am not...
...clean.
They're waiting for us.
Dr Slattery?
Germs. Germs. I'm
just trying to get...
sterile. Is this sterile enough?
I don't know if you've
seen one of these.
It's a very challenging procedure.
Without the CAT scan,
we can't pinpoint the haematoma.
A lot of spine may be exposed.
It's a delicate procedure.
It should be between T9 and T10.
Doctor, I don't think
I'm the man for this job.
I don't understand.
I don't want to know.
I don't care who you are.
Send Joffe up here.
Keep your hands in your pockets
and run this hospital.
Thank you, Doctor.
Do we have enough IV fluid?
- Rachel, I need a hand in here.
Get these kids out of here, please.
Get these children out.
Doctor, she's fully dilated.
- She's having a baby?
Yes, he'll come out like a gumball.
Hold her hand while
she bears down.
OK, dear. Come on, push.
Push.
- You got my arm. Hey!
Just take deep breaths.
Good. Good girl.
It was a head.
It went back up, but it was a head.
Good girl. Good girl.
When you're ready.
- Breathe slow now.
Good girl. You're doing well.
- Another one is coming.
You know what to do.
- Oh, my God!
Good. Good.
- I did another.
Don't worry. Push now.
- Oh, my God!
Push!
- It's coming!
It's coming out. It's a baby!
Doctor, catch it.
- Oh, my God, it's a baby boy.
It's a boy.
- It's a baby! It's a baby! It's a baby!
There's a lot of mucus.
- It's a baby boy.
Look at the nuts on your baby.
- Rachel, you cut the cord.
Oh, baby.
- OK.
Oh, my God, baby!
Hold him. I'm not holding him.
- You should be proud.
You worked real hard. Would you...
give the baby back
to Mommy now?
We'll keep you warm.
Good girl, you did well.
- Here's your baby.
That's your mommy.
- It's my baby.
Thank you, Doctor.
- You're a good mommy.
Good baby, too.
You act as if you've
never seen one.
I've seen one before.
Every time I deliver a baby,
it's like the first time.
It's a baby.
Everything worked
out great. He's fine.
Great. Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Well...
Victory cigar?
What's your favourite flavour?
Red.
- Red. Shit!
I'll never get one.
You saved his life.
Me? You did.
No, you did.
- It was a team effort.
You and me was a team?
- We make a good team.
ER?
- Yeah, I...
Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.
Do you like moving
from hospital to hospital?
Never getting to know
the people you work with.
Is that a proposal?
- It's an offer.
Well, I have been
thinking I should be...
more serious about my career.
OK, junkies, change shifts.
Here you go.
Shit, man!
Who is he?
- Where'd he come from?
Man, get up.
- Help me turn him over.
Give us a hand.
- Get his head out of the water.
Give it up.
- We got ourselves a dead cop.
He washed in.
- Call ER.
He's dead. Who was he?
- The cop who brought me in.
You killed him?
There's gotta be another boat key.
You're in on this.
Hold the light.
Jack!
- You chickenshit!
Shit.
As New Yorkers woke up
to the aftermath of the storm,
they found widespread damage
and blackouts.
The cop didn't drown.
He was strangled.
Did you see a man
in prison denims...
in hospital tonight
since the blackout?
It's my fault. Please
think. He had a limp.
Wait. Why would someone come
back if he's trying to escape?
He killed a cop.
You escape while the body's warm.
Right.
This guy's been
dead for ten hours.
The causeway was still
in then. It didn't...
go out till I tried to
escape... evacuate.
He got off the island
when the lights went out.
You want to believe that.
- I'll radio the city police.
Come on, Box. I go
free, you go free.
You'll come to my
house for dinner.
Meet the wife and kids.
I got no clothes.
I'll lend you some.
We'll just let out the
shoulders a little.
Miss Atwood, come in, please.
Miss Atwood, come in, please.
Arthur?
You'll never guess where I've been.
I've been held hostage
in the psycho ward.
When you have a free moment,
could you come up
and let me out?
Oh, God. Shit. Yes!
Miss Atwood is a
witness that I agree...
to these demands of
my own free will.
"Nurses with bigger..."?
- Just open the door!
Hold it. I want Kevin
Lennihan. This guy...
makes me crazy. Get me Lennihan.
Lenni-who?
- I thought we made a deal.
Kevin Lennihan. I want him here.
- I don't know him.
He's black like me.
Late 30s, moustache.
He ain't crazy like us.
Where the hell is he?
- Tell him he's gone!
Describe him some more.
- He was in real estate.
He owned his own helicopter.
He ain't bonkers. He just acted
that way to stay out of jail.
He's crazy, but just about them
damn Lifesavers, especially red.
He didn't stick around...
- Shut up. He didn't run out on us.
Listen, lady.
Either you bring Kevin
Lennihan to me...
or sunshine here ends up
part of the goddamn parking lot!
Get that?
- Yes, sir.
Talk to these people!
- Shut up or I'll feed you to Fido!
Louis, no, no.
No, ma'am. You know
our condition.
Get outta here.
Give her some juice.
How's everything?
- Fine, thank you, Doctor.
I'll tell Dr Joffe you're OK.
He's going into law.
What's the game?
- The game's craps.
Mr Lennihan.
He's cheating you.
Mr Lennihan.
I can't stand this!
You better give me my money.
How could you? Stolen jewels are
one thing, but delivering a baby?!
What was going on in your mind?
What if it was breech?
A hundred things
could've gone wrong.
I would've been
responsible, not you.
You took advantage of everyone,
especially me. I'm
history in this hospital.
I tore open the front door because
of you. I blew up Chambers' lab.
I took the risks.
- What risks?
You were playing
with people's lives.
Rachel.
Don't call me Rachel,
I'm Miss Atwood.
Where would you
have been without me?
You made me believe
anything was possible.
You'd have fallen on your face if it...
wasn't for me. I don't
deserve this shit.
You deserve to be in
jail, which is where...
you're going once
you free Chambers.
Wait.
- For what?
You've a heart bypass scheduled?
A little brain surgery?
I'm not gonna free Chambers
if I go to jail anyway.
We'll have to make a deal.
Nobody goes to Dannemora.
Nobody, especially Box. I want...
your word. No one
goes to Dannemora.
OK. Nothing for you though, right?
Wrong. I'm getting out. All I want
is a boat and I'm outta here.
You see, now I know who you are.
You're Lennihan.
Nothing for nothing, right?
Call it like you see
it, OK? Is it a deal?
Yeah.
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
Lennihan! All right,
Lennihan, my man!
I knew you was coming back!
What's going on?
- I agreed to two conditions.
He gets safe conduct, no one...
goes to Dannemora,
Box'll let you out.
Absolutely, it's a deal.
- Look at you, man.
Eight hours ago, you was a dog.
Now you're a doctor.
You make me proud
to be an American,
I swear.
This is very touching, but...
Unless you really
want to get touched,
shut up and get out of my face.
You got a way with people, Box.
Chambers wanted to let me out,
but I didn't think
it was a good idea.
No, not this way, Box.
You're probably right.
Yeah, you're right.
You really trust her.
- She's a stand-up lady.
Your word is gold
with me, bubba, gold.
This is where I was
headed 12 hours...
ago. Had some fun. Made a friend.
Why is she pissed off at you?
I can't get it.
I do.
But you acted like a pro.
- I'm not a pro.
I'm a bullshitter, like she said.
I'm full of shit.
97, 98, 99,100!
Get outta here and
don't come back!
He's not getting away.
- We made a deal.
Stop being a fool.
He's not getting off this island.
A man's escaped from Psycho.
Secure the grounds.
The causeway's out.
He's got to be hiding
in the hospital.
Forget the grounds.
We'll turn the hospital inside out.
If he should suffer injury during...
recapture, no one
will be reprimanded.
That's a promise.
Nobody asked her what to do.
Everybody asked you.
You had all the great ideas.
She's a hard-ass.
- No more about that lady.
Just untie me. I don't
want to take the...
dock with me. I'm trying
to start this boat.
We needed the air.
There was no circulation.
How...?
Arthur.
You couldn't tell a doctor
from a psychotic con man?
Calm down. We heard...
what you've been
through. Terrible!
But console yourself,
no matter who Slattery was,
we didn't lose a single life tonight.
That's what's important.
You won't think so
when you're in court.
What are you talking about?
We can justify everything.
"We"? "We"? You!
You were the senior
physician here.
Don't. We have to stick together.
You went over the
wall on your own.
The hospital won't
share your liability...
in disregarding procedures!
But the situation...
You're looking at a
litigation blizzard!
Anyone who catches a cold
has a good case for malpractice.
Junkies roaming the halls.
Orderlies prescribing diets.
Dismembered ambulances.
And a helicopter in
my fucking lobby!
Oh, God! Why did
I become a doctor?
I could've been a lawyer.
Given the shape this hospital is in,
I don't see what other choice
Dr Foster had.
You'll be asking
that question for years,
when you're practising medicine in
Idaho. You're finished in this city.
They have lots to thank you for.
Fuck off. What are
you talking about?
Thank you for your
professional opinion.
You'll be back emptying bedpans.
Me?
- This is totally uncalled for.
They did what had to be done.
If you treat them like this...
Yes?
...I will resign.
That's the first helpful thing
you've done. Clear your desk.
Keep going! Keep going!
It's not your problem! Oh, shit!
Get back! Get back!
Jail, remember?
The fire's in the laundry room.
- God, what next?
Across the lawn.
Be careful. The fire's out back.
The fire's out back. Get everybody...
out front. You're
going the wrong way.
Dr Joffe, get to OR.
Check on Tommy Pinto.
Dr Foster, over to ICU.
We may have to evacuate.
Everybody move it.
Get everybody out front.
And some equipment.
We may need it for fire victims.
Everybody move it!
Nobody's moving!
Do as he says!
Dr Slattery, great to have you back.
- I'm Kevin Lennihan.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Lennihan.
Louis!
- Yes!
Pull out the hose. Come on!
- Get it straight.
Forwards, not backwards!
It's hot, man!
I know. But don't
give up on me now.
The exits are in that direction.
Calm down.
The key to the boat.
The key.
- I don't have it.
Don't lie to me.
- Here, take 'em.
You come for insurance.
Give me more line! Stay with it.
It's him. Now he's trying
to burn down my hospital!
Security, bring weapons
and sharp objects.
I've got you now, Lennihan.
Incitement to riot. Kidnap. Arson.
- Fuck you!
Destruction of my...!
Way to go!
Sir, Ms Ellis is stuck...
- Fuck Ms Ellis!
Get this maniac. He's not a doctor!
- Why should they listen to you?
Arrest him.
That's an order. Are you deaf?
Lennihan saved your hospital.
That's right.
- He's right.
You're as gullible as the halfwits...
in the psycho ward.
He's conned you all.
I'm a con man?
What are you, Chambers?
You've conned them into...
believing you could
run this hospital.
They're scared and
pissed off at you.
You know why? I'll tell you.
You never let them
use their own minds.
You come down on them.
They don't know how
to deal with it,
so they panicked.
You've got good people.
Some real stars.
Besides that, you
got a great hospital.
This is an insanity plea!
You're telling me how
to run a hospital?
Industrial accidents!
Preventive maintenance is the key.
If you'd used that,
Tommy Pinto wouldn't...
have gone up on the
roof in a hurricane.
Accidents happen.
- Emergency generators!
They went out.
Chief administrator's
responsibility.
You tell him, Doc.
Nobody's interested
in these wild allegations.
Press!
Radio. TV. Newspapers.
I know people
who'd be glad to print this story.
If that don't work,
these people have...
stories they'd be willing
to tell the press.
You bet!
You don't want to get her started.
Please help me, someone.
Security. Chambers.
Please, I'm in the boiler room.
Stucky's after me.
He's still on the island?
- Oh, Christ!
Give me that. Cover the grounds.
- Who's Stucky?
Oh, my aching balls!
- That should do it.
Louis, I need help.
Can you hear me?
Send me somebody quick.
Come on!
The key! The key!
This is the end.
I don't need you any more.
No.
Please, no.
We got the place surrounded.
Permission to move in.
No.
I got the bastard in my sights, sir.
Permission to fire.
Get that helicopter outta here!
I hope you get him
when they come out the door.
If they come out the back door,
we got 'em.
What if they go back
in the hospital?
We can't have that.
Nobody's guarding
the back of the hospital.
This is a Big Daddy
with a big ten-four...
What about the girl?
We kill everybody.
No! Please.
Shit, sir.
Move it!
Which way to the boat?
- The door. Over there.
Rachel, run!
Eddie!
- Go! Go!
One, two... Come
on, baby. Come on.
Black bastard! I'll kill you!
Rachel, get out!
- Come on.
Get out!
Where's the boat?
- Over there.
Damn you!
I'm gonna get that motherfucker.
I'm OK.
Come on. All right!
Nobody kicks my
dog, motherfucker!
Oh, shit!
Motherfucker!
You fucking wimpo doctor!
- I am not a doctor!
We some bad black
motherfuckers,
ain't we?
Damn right, bubba.
Are you all right?
Take care of them.
Not them. Him!
All right. Come on, Stucky.
Let's say your files
were destroyed in the fire.
Thanks.
You're free and clear.
You can start all over.
I like the sound of that.
- Get outta here, Lennihan.
Damn, bubba.
- You the man, Lennihan.
You take it easy, Fido.
Why couldn't you be Dr Slattery?
- I wish I could be who you wanted.
But I'm not.
I think you might be, Mr Lennihan.
Would you have dinner with me?
- I'd like that.
Very much.
Eight hours ago, I was a lunatic
in an insane asylum.
Right? Now I got a yacht.
I met a nice lady.
Proud to be an American.
