Dozens of people were killed today
during three Jihadist attacks
in Kuwait, Tunisia, and Lyon, France.
The situation in Iraq remains very volatile.
Yemen was plunged into darkness today
when al-Qaeda operatives
attacked the country's power grid.
A massive effort
by the National Security Agency
to track cellphone calls and monitor
email and Internet traffic
of virtually everyone.
We've seen eight successive presidents
increasingly ruled by executive order.
Will Congress bite this dictatorship
of secret government? Of course they won't.
Your class has an incredible
window of opportunity
to lead in shaping
a new world order...
There also exists
an extraordinary opportunity
to form, for the first time in history,
a truly global society.
These global corporations,
these global banks,
will be able to create boons for profit,
depressions for profit, even wars for profit.
We must guard against the acquisition
of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought,
by the military industrial complex.
Large populations
are difficult to control.
That's why the future
the globalists have planned
will contain us, will constrain us,
will eliminate us.
Ordinary men and women are too
small-minded to govern their own affairs.
Order, progress,
can only come when individuals
surrender their rights
to an all-powerful sovereign.
We have a fog that has descended
on our entire nation,
the smoke screen of national security,
used by government at every level
to keep everything they do secret.
We have before us the opportunity to forge,
for ourselves and for future generations,
a new world order when we are successful.
And we will be.
We have a real chance
at this new world order.
Their strength is in secrecy,
but our strength is to shed light
on what they do in the dark
and to stand united against it!
You have ten minutes.
Thank you, Senator. I appreciate the time.
My name is Charles Grey.
I'm a semi-retired businessman
with interests both domestically
and internationally.
The reason I'm here today
is to encourage the U.S. Congress
to take action to protect our country
from its most imminent threat.
We don't need you
to try to educate us on threats.
Your Congress commissioned a study
that found that our nation
is sustained by a vulnerable
and woefully outdated power grid.
Your commission found that our enemies...
and yes, even we...
have developed weapons that are designed
to bring down this grid.
Your peers determined that immediately
after the detonation
of one of these weapons,
we would lose all sources of power.
Electricity would cease to exist.
The Internet would go down,
and along with that, the banking system.
All clear.
Search the room.
Just who made you the expert on this?
You don't have to be an expert
to understand this.
You just have to read
your own damn findings.
According to your report,
90% of the American population
will die in the first 12 months.
Enough, we're done.
Pressing matters need to be addressed.
I want you to pass the Shield Act,
which will harden the grid in our country.
I came here to call you to action.
What you got?
Some small-calibre weapons
and a rabbit gun.
Let's bag 'em up.
We don't have time for this.
You had time to pass
the National Defense Authorization Act
to give the President the power
to declare martial law for any reason,
to give him the power
to arrest any American
by simply accusing them of terrorism,
imprisoning them indefinitely
without charges and no legal counsel.
This was just a funding bill.
You have your facts sorely misplaced.
What's wrong with you?
This. This doesn't look
like some al-Qaeda hideout.
Looks more like my apartment
than some mud hut in Fallujah.
You think too much, eh.
You got a shitty apartment, then.
This hearing is over.
Who do you think you are,
coming in to this committee
and making a mockery
of our elected leaders, Mr. Grey?
I'm an American citizen who's fed up
with an out-of-control,
dictatorial government.
Don't think, Mr. Grey,
that we don't know what you're up to,
stockpiling food, weapons, fuel.
The National Defense Authorization Act
is there to stop domestic terrorists,
threats to this country,
and people like you.
I am an American.
I am a patriot.
You, sir, are nothing but a traitor.
Son...
I've never seen anything like that in my life.
That man's a threat to this country.
That little rant will be
all over the news tonight.
This plays into our hands.
The American news media has our narrative,
and in that narrative,
Charlie Grey is perfectly playing
the role of right-wing extremist.
The stigma of that label will stop up
the ears of the American public
faster than any propaganda
we could fashion.
- Lieutenant Lane.
- Sir?
Have your men clear
and safety their weapons.
There'll be a debriefing at 20:45.
Do you copy?
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.
But what if even a small percentage
of the population were to...
awaken?
By that time, it'll be too late.
Let's just get word out
through the proper channels
to the American brass
who understand the mission.
Seems our testing
of certain units has gone well.
We rig up a few of the Russians
and the Chinese and integrate them.
That will be the perfect litmus test.
Isn't that a good boy.
You're Mommy's good boy?
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
You certainly are.
Okay. Oh, got a phone call.
Gonna answer the phone?
Can Mama answer the phone?
Oh, hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?
No, no, I'm just, uh,
workin' with the horses.
Sure.
Oh, no, no,
I've already taken care of the cake.
Yeah, I thought we discussed that.
Uh-huh.
Well, what time?
Oh, that's perfect. Sure.
You know Mama. I don't think we're gonna
be able to pull the wool over her eyes,
but we can certainly try.
All right, then.
All right, I'll see ya later. Bye.
When you suppose
we're gonna go back to base?
I'm tired of using porta-potties.
Don't know. When we're told.
Mm, you'd think that the government
would put a little extra effort
into an architect or something.
- It's weird.
- What more do we need?
Got a couple tents, some tins, storage,
vacant town down the way.
Better than bein' at base.
Yeah, I guess so.
I-I just really wanna know
what's in that building.
Our comm system sucks,
and look at all that hardware
just sprouting through the roof.
It doesn't make sense.
- It's above my pay grade.
- Yeah, well, I may have to take a peek.
All right, Sherlock. You need a new hobby.
Oh, this ain't a hobby.
I got it all figured out.
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.
You see...
private eyes can make some bank.
Just, uh, follow around a cheatin' husband,
take some pictures, set up some bugs.
Some easy money.
Well, if I ever need one,
you'll be my guy.
That's really sweet,
I'll give you a good rate.
Well, all that sounds great,
but I could use a hot shower
and a nice scrubber.
You think they'd try
to be less conspicuous.
They want us to see it.
Yeah, well I'd like to take a potshot
and clip the damn thing.
Sam, now what have you done?
Oh, you know me,
can't keep a match out of my hands.
I can take pretty much anyone,
but it's gonna be my chemistry
degree that kills me.
Okay, boss,
you're gonna have to take this one.
I can't deal with a headache and a burn.
I'll be in my cave.
How's my favorite liberal state rep?
Fine, Charlie.
Just dropping Penny off at school.
Listen, Charlie, about the hearing.
We need to talk damage control.
No damage on our end, Roger.
Nothing unintended anyway.
Charlie, this is serious.
We need to talk face to face.
Listen to me. This is important.
Fine, we're gonna have
a small party for Betty.
I'll have Sam send you over the details.
It'll give you a chance to see a nice drone
some people from Washington sent over.
Drone? Why would they send
a drone over your ranch?
I just...
Look, just have Sam
send me the details, please.
Dad, why do you waste your time
with that fascist conspiracy nut?
Well, Penny, you been
around the game long enough,
you know a campaign costs money.
I got this guy Harris by only four points.
I just need...
Look, politics aside,
Charlie and I go way, way back.
He looks at things one way.
I look at things another way.
I wouldn't go so far
as to call him a fascist.
Hey, Charlie's always been good to you.
Well, being good and being right
are completely separate things.
I mean, I've seen his ramblings
on the Internet. It's disgusting.
All those accusations about the president.
I mean, a man as rich as Grey,
and there's all these poor people in the area
and he just hoards it to himself.
A halfway decent man
would spread his wealth around.
Well, he does.
He's actually my largest donor.
We're doing a teach-in at a women's clinic.
That is if your patron, Mr. Grey,
doesn't mind that I choose
what to do with my body.
No, all right, all right.
Can you pause your lecture long enough
to give your old sell-out dad
a kiss goodbye, please?
Love you, Dad.
Feels good to hold
the real thing in your hand.
There's a joke in there.
You know what I mean.
Real bullets, not that paintball crap.
Gentlemen, let's do this on three, huh?
One...
two...
Whoo!
I win. Y'all cheated,
and I still whooped you both.
- My little sister shoots better than y'all.
- Frankie? Yeah, she probably does.
Well, my guy's dancing with his 72 virgins.
That's an excessive amount
of inexperienced women.
Dead either way.
That's not one of our vehicles.
UN logo on the side.
Yeah, but what the hell
is the UN doin' here?
There's gotta be some good reason.
When we need to know, we'll know.
How 'bout best two outta three? Huh?
On behalf of the President
of the United States, welcome.
There are two attach√©s each for you
on the outskirts of the camp.
If you would, please.
Hey, Mama.
Hey, Mama.
I tell you, there is somethin' wrong
with that girl out there.
Seems like anything with a barrel
or a blade is a toy to her.
Probably 'cause she's just like her mother.
Mama... you were supposed
to start takin' your medicine.
I'm done.
Done... done with what?
This isn't even open.
All the pills, the shots,
the scans, the probes, everything.
I still got cancer.
It's not going anywhere.
- Mama.
- Besides...
I feel great, just great.
From now on, I'm livin' on faith.
It serves me real good.
I know, Mama, but...
but you can't just give up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now when did I ever gave up?
Not me.
I'm done, Grandma.
Oh, Frankie, thank you, darlin'.
Listen, you've done enough for today.
That's it, okay?
Frankie, would you please back me up here
and explain to your grandmother
that she needs to start takin' her medicine?
Girls, girls, listen to me.
And listen good.
Look around.
Look at the world.
In my dreams... I see it.
I see it just as plain as day.
World's goin' to hell in a hand basket.
Charlie sees it, too.
And when it comes, Frankie,
you take your mother
and you just get over to Charlie's.
He will be able to protect you,
and he will want to.
Who's gonna protect Brandon?
God will protect Brandon.
Listen up, domestic threats
have now become
a top priority of this administration.
Subsequently, we will be starting
a series of training exercises,
military operations in urban terrain.
Lieutenant Lane, you have a question.
Yes, sir. Colonel, what domestic
threats are we talking about?
There are a variety of scenarios.
Not the least of which,
mass attacks on the homeland.
At which time it will become necessary
to protect the majority of the citizens
against the minority of the extremists.
And who defines the term extremist, sir?
That would be your Commander-in-Chief,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That fits with your approval, Lieutenant?
Perfectly, sir.
Very well.
Local law enforcement will be...
- Is that good, boss?
- ...and unable to stop armed gangs or militia.
Every man, woman and child in America
will be looking to each and every one of you
and everyone under your command
to restore order.
Will you be ready?
- Yes, sir.
- I did not hear you.
Yes, sir!
- Hoorah!
- Hoorah!
Dismissed.
Malcolm...
you have a lot on your mind.
A sustainable population of our planet
is no more than 500 million.
And we're willing to kill 7 billion.
Well, most of those lives...
aren't worth living.
A mass of humanity
in Africa, India and China,
they live in squalor.
They'd be better off dead.
The world would be better off without them.
- And America will be first.
- Yes, well...
as our friend Henry Kissinger said,
"A strong America is the only thing
standing in the way of a new world order."
We have foreign troops on the ground now,
under the UN banner.
The country only needs a little chaos.
The American people are resilient.
What's to come if the citizens rise up?
Yes, well, when parents
see their children starving,
families hauled away to FEMA camps
for imprisonment or worse,
then yes, yes,
we expect some resistance...
at first.
But the vanity of nationalism
will quickly fade.
The people will beg for help,
any help.
These are but the birth pangs of change.
Hmm, birth pangs of a new world order.
The sign says River Street.
So how do we tell a tango
versus a friendly?
You heard the Colonel.
Consider all armed a target.
I don't know, Lieutenant,
this is like training in Amer...
In America, I know.
Let me remind you,
the Boston bombers were U.S. citizens.
Um, not so sure about that.
United States Army.
Hey, there. How can I help you gentlemen?
My name is Lieutenant Lane.
Martial law has been declared.
Under martial law,
we need to know if you have
any weapons in your home
or on your possession.
Oh, no, not a gun guy.
Never really understood
that whole right-to-carry thing.
You and the police are the only ones
that need it anyway.
Feel free to come in and check.
My name's David.
All right, thank you, David.
Just a random check, sir.
Do you know of anyone in the neighbourhood
who may have weapons?
Well, I don't want to get involved,
but my next-door neighbour,
he's a bit patriotic.
He's got NRA stickers.
He's a bit of a gun nut.
Quite frankly, I'm frightened of him.
- We're good.
- Thank you, sir. Sorry for the intrusion.
Oh, no problem,
just happy you're here to help us.
Well, that wasn't weird at all.
It was like, uh, Stepford Wives,
but with a dude.
Let's just knock this out.
Stay on mission.
Perfect.
"Stay on mission."
Who is this platoon leader?
Lieutenant Brandon Lane.
Third in a line of good military men.
Mother's a veterinarian.
Sister's 15 years old.
Shoot the eyes out of a turkey
at a hundred yards.
Father was KIA in Iraq.
Anything else you need to know?
You can see he has the hearts of his men.
If you have his, you have theirs.
- If not...
- Yeah, I get it.
He's a wildcard,
but he's tamable.
United States Army.
Please come to the door.
- What can I help you with?
- Please just come to the door, sir.
- You're on private property.
- I understand that, sir.
But under martial law,
we need to know if you have any weapons
inside your home or on your person.
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
All legal, all licensed.
- Just like the Second Amendment allows.
- I understand that, sir,
But martial law has been declared,
and under the National
Defense Authorization Act,
I am going to send in my men
to search for and confiscate
any weapons that you have.
No, you're not.
- Don't do that again, sir.
- Get the hell off of my property.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Do you have any weapons
inside or on your person?
I already told you I do.
Now I'll use them, too,
if you don't get the hell off of my property!
Sir, martial law has been declared.
I don't give a spit
about your martial law.
- Get the hell off my property.
- Go, go, go.
Ah!
Got me in the nuts.
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm sorry, man, I'm just doin'...
- Who told you you could shoot one of my men?
- I'm doing what they told me to do, man.
I'm a crisis actor.
Ben.
Go.
I'm a crisis actor, man.
This is not my calling.
This is not. I need another job.
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.
- Hey!
- How'd the meeting with Professor Stern go?
Well, he's decided to publish
Feminist and Fabulous.
Oh, my God! Like your own manifesto.
I know, I mean, I couldn't make up
the stuff he was saying to me.
Um, "Your generation finally has the chance
to bury the God and guns culture,"
and I can't even remember what else.
So cool.
You know he's right.
You're gonna change the world.
I'm gonna change the world.
Sir.
- Stand at ease.
- Yes, sir.
You wanna explain to me
what that stunt was you pulled in training?
Sorry, sir. Concerned for my man.
I lost control.
Losing control is not an option, Lieutenant.
Shit happens in exercises
just like it does in the real world.
Now you wanna tell me just exactly
what is bitin' you in the ass?
Sir?
I need to know you're on board
with this program.
Understood, sir.
The last two weeks of our training
has slowly turned into more of...
I explained that.
It's about saving American lives.
Then why did I see a UN vehicle pull up
and two non-Americans get out?
You saluted them both.
They didn't look like allies to me.
That is classified, Lieutenant.
And if I hear you utter a single word
about anything you may or may not have seen,
I will see to it that the only training
you do for the rest of your freakin' life
is push-ups in the brig.
Am I clear, soldier?
- Yes, sir.
- There will be a briefing tomorrow, 07:00.
It will further clarify things.
Do not be late.
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.
- Hello?
- Mr. Grey, it's Brandon Lane.
Brandon, how ya doin', son?
I'm, uh...
uh...
What's wrong?
Well, it's just... strange things
have been happening here.
Strange how?
Well, I've seen a UN vehicle come and go,
and there's rumours
of foreign soldiers on base.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And lately our training's been more like...
like urban warfare.
Have they mentioned domestic terrorism?
Yes, sir, they have.
Brandon, listen to me carefully.
You may be having to make
some very difficult decisions.
I'm sorry, Mr. Grey, I gotta go.
Nice ride, sir.
She's my pride and joy.
Goes with me everywhere.
Did you know this little lady right here
has been to Iraq twice?
Colonel, is there a... Mrs. Crane?
Is there a Mrs. Crane?
Oh, there was a Mrs. Crane...
but I got the motorcycle anyway.
Times are changing, Lieutenant.
Better change with 'em.
You get left behind.
I can see that, sir.
Hello, Mr. President.
Operation Dark Star has commenced.
You listen to me very, very carefully,
Mr. President.
You knew damn good and well
when we vetted you
that this day was going to come.
Well, the committee and I
have decided now is the time.
This was a courtesy call,
neither a warning nor a threat.
When you sell your soul,
it's a one-time thing.
There's no going back.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
All right, all right, don't panic.
Just keep the horse upright.
I'm on my way.
I got a horse in breach.
Frankie, Sam's gonna pick ya up and take ya
over to Mr. Grey's house, okay?
Awesome, maybe Sam will let me
use one of her AR-15s.
Good Lord, Frankie.
I'm gonna go ahead and go with Frankie
to Charlie's because...
Look, I know about my surprise birthday cake.
Don't worry about me seeing it.
I think it's great,
just great what you're doin'.
But Charlie and I have some talking to do.
I got a mother that wants to start a militia
and my daughter wants to fight in one.
This is why I became a veterinarian.
- Aha.
- Lord help me.
- I love you.
- I love you, Mama. Bye.
- We're gonna skadoot and skedaddle.
- All right.
Be seated.
By order of the Commander-in-Chief,
we will be cooperating
with the United Nations.
We'll be running joint drills here Stateside.
Colonel, if I may.
Floor is yours, Colonel.
My name is Colonel Kashoid.
I'm here with Colonel Wong
on behalf of the UN.
Our countries have found it beneficial
on a number of different levels
to come together as "friends"
under the United Nations banner
to do joint exercises
in the case of any type
of either natural or civil unrest.
Can I get anything for the birthday girl?
No, thank you. This is doing me just fine.
Charlie, could you sit down
for just a moment, please?
I'd like to talk to you.
I recall very vividly
a radio program in 1950
and this man was testifying
in front of Congress and he said,
"We shall have world government
whether we like it or not.
The only question is,
if world government will be accomplished
by conquest or consent."
He made a bold and stupid statement.
Unfortunately, it's true.
Well, look who I found lurking outside.
Lurking, lurking. What can you expect?
The gentleman's a politician.
Oh, Mama.
Oh, Roger, I just wanted to bust
your chops and keep you humble.
- Always good to see you, ma'am.
- Pleasure's mine.
Charlie?
How is it every campaign I give you money,
but I never vote for you?
Well, I aim to change that.
Is that what's got you all dark
and brooding, Lieutenant?
You have better eyes than you think, Hamm.
She dumped me when I joined.
Now you're sitting here wondering
just what the hell it is you're doing.
You sign up to defend a country
it's... getting hard to recognize.
Something like that?
Yeah, something like that.
That's why I think
you should know about this, sir.
What is it?
It's something I'm gonna put in my footlocker
for when the fit hits the shan.
If something happens to me... it's yours.
I ain't gonna let nothing happen to you.
I'm gonna go put this back.
Release the device.
# Happy birthday to you #
Oh!
Happy birthday, Mama.
I love you.
One of these days I'm gonna learn
how to play this stupid thing.
All the lights are off.
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
- You're gonna stay with me, right?
- Of course.
I'm not going anywhere, okay?
It happened, didn't it?
I'm not sure, but we'll find out soon.
Something must've hit a transformer.
- We just got hit by an EMP.
- We should go help 'em.
There's nothing we can do, Timmes.
There's no trucks. Nothing works.
Then what's that?
Truck's old school, pre-electronics.
They must've had some protected somewhere.
That's awfully convenient.
We deploy in one hour.
Ready your platoons.
We have support coming from Fort Campbell.
Move out.
Hold up, Colonel.
Sir, what's the mission?
You do not tell me to hold up!
Sir, what is the mission?
Martial law has been declared, Lieutenant.
Martial law? Already? It just happened.
We're gonna have to restore order,
so you tell your men
to get their gear and mount up.
- What is our mission?
- Restore order.
Disarm the population,
subdue resistance at any cost.
There's no way martial law
was declared that quickly.
Lieutenant, you will follow my orders
or I will have you arrested.
Sir, I have sworn to protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.
I will not fire on innocent
American citizens.
- Then you will die.
- Back off, guys.
Stand down. That's an order.
Now... Colonel...
what to do with him?
Lock him up, we'll deal with him later.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Bad call, son.
Let's go, guys, come on.
You're dead, Lane.
You don't know what's going on!
You're dead!
Hey, boss. It was an EMP.
Anyone coming down here
won't be with good intentions.
Though I'd say everyone's laying low,
probably riding this out tonight.
Tonight, but give it a day or two.
We've got what they want.
Well, Charlie, thank you again
for letting us stay with you.
Let Sam take you down to your house
to get what you and your family need.
- We could leave before sunup, we're good.
- Okay.
Come on, guys, hurry up, hurry up.
Come here to me.
Come over here to your grandmother.
You know, when I was your age,
I was a tough son of a biscuit eater,
just like you.
Go, your old grandmother's just fine.
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Oh.
Colonel, I think I saw him over here!
Don't let him get away.
Ah!
Battery's dead, now my phone won't work.
It's dead.
Excuse me, ladies.
Aw, sh...
Hello?
Anybody home?
- Hello?
- What do you want?
Please, sir, I'm no trouble.
Just a soldier trying to get home.
- What's your name, boy?
- Brandon Lane. Lieutenant.
Well, I was.
- Lieutenant, huh?
- Yes, sir.
I reckon I got two options with you.
One: I stick a bullet
right here in your face...
Please, sir.
Or two: I figure out
who you are... and what's going on.
Is that what you want?
- Yes, sir.
- Come on in.
Your president has signed
all executive orders
that gives the United Nations full control
of your country and constitution.
We have no constitution.
Dammit.
I knew there was corruption
in Washington, D.C.,
but these sons-of-bitches
are making toilet paper
out of our constitution.
Yeah, for starters.
Now, your friend that had this...
Killed... by those men.
I'm sorry.
But how did this thing survive an EMP attack?
It was in his metal locker,
so... just luck, I guess.
I don't believe in luck.
Your country's going
to the dogs right now, Charlie.
There have been rumours
of FEMA camps being set up.
The beast has reared its ugly head.
It's only North America?
That's what the news is here.
I appreciate any news
you can send our way.
Copy that. Be safe, Charlie.
You need to get me out of here.
- Obviously, your car's dead.
- Yes, it is.
You don't... you don't get it, do you?
I am a state representative.
We are in a crisis.
I need to get back to Austin
and help figure this out.
- Figure what out?
- What we need to do to fix the problem.
You were the problem.
You can kiss your government goodbye.
What, you think a power outage
has just erased our government?
There's a government, all right.
Just not the one you're used to.
That's absurd.
The time to act was
when this problem was preventable.
How? You tell me, Charlie.
How was this preventable?
The Congressional reports I sent you,
all the recommendations of the panel?
You didn't read a single one of
them that I sent you, did you?
Charlie, do you know how much crap
goes across my desk every day?
You've already blown this.
And what you really need
to be thinking about now?
Penny.
Seems like the power
should've been on by now.
Yeah, but no power means
no class tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm getting kind of tired.
I'm gonna go up soon.
Me too. I don't even know what time it is.
Look, I-I bet you the sun's
gonna be up in, like, an hour.
I say we just ride it out.
You thought you could hide from me?
Nightmare.
Yes, sir.
Tough to shake.
Took me years.
Coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
I know it ain't the best, but...
Not so bad.
You're a terrible liar, Lieutenant.
It shows your character.
Thank you.
Charlie?
If that really was an EMP yesterday...
Half-a-million people perished last night.
And things are only gonna get worse.
How could it get worse?
No power.
Everything shuts down.
Hospitals, fuel, travel... Food spoils.
The average American family
only has three days of food.
Hungry people do desperate things
to feed their families.
And all of this could've been prevented?
Yes.
I wish I had more fuel for ya.
It'll be fine, it'll get me going.
Hey, I appreciate the food,
clothes, everything.
Hey.
I don't know what you're gonna
come across on your way home.
I don't even know
what the world looks like now.
And you're holding a powerful truth.
And what you decide to do with it
is going to be very dangerous.
Godspeed.
Thanks, Harlan.
Frankie.
Do you understand what's happening?
No, all I know is the power went out.
You're a smart girl, Frankie.
What do you want?
Tooth-fairy version... or the truth?
I want the truth.
Truth is, this is the time...
...when folks run and hide,
or they pull up their bootstraps
and they fight.
Man, woman, young or old.
I'll fight.
Kelly?
Hey, Mama.
Frankie.
I'm just so afraid of the world
that you're gonna have to grow up in.
I just want my family back together again.
Kelly, baby, come here.
Roger, I need to show you something.
But I can't show the politician
who I don't trust to keep his big mouth shut.
Yes, if it means getting Penny back safely,
absolutely. You have my word.
It's a Faraday cage.
Military's been using 'em since the '50s.
I'm sorry, a... Faraday cage?
It's a building that protects
electronics from an EMP.
Could be as simple
as a jury-rigged trash can or...
well, this.
That chopper, it's what Sam and I
are gonna take to go get Penny.
Hello?
Hey there, friend.
No power here either?
Nope, nada.
I could use some fuel,
enough to fill the tank and the jug.
Might be a little tough.
You know, I need to keep it for the town.
- There's no telling when the power...
- I hear you, no problem.
But... maybe if you sweeten the pot.
- What are you thinking?
- You got any guns?
No, don't let the military bike
fool you, man, I'm a pacifist.
It's gonna take a lot of money, then.
Maybe I got something better.
One ounce of silver.
- Right now, it could be worth a grand.
- Holy shit.
Argh! Ah!
- You can come out now.
- Please don't hurt me.
- You Toby?
- Yeah, this is my store.
What is left of it.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
This big fella have anything to do with this?
Hey, get him, get him!
Toby, can I please have some gas now?
Come on, let's keep looking.
We'll find her.
I say we stay low,
avoid any stray pops coming at us.
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.
There she is! Get her!
Where's the politician's daughter?
Charlie.
- There she is.
- I've got her.
Shut up, or I'm gonna bash your face in.
Penny!
Penny, get down!
- Penny, I've been looking everywhere for you.
- You left me.
- I'm sorry.
- Penny, we gotta go!
Stay back!
Nice punch.
I wish Mr. Green was here.
Your science teacher?
He used to be a farmer before all this GMO,
Frankenstein food came along.
You know what?
Overwhelming evidence indicates
there are no scientific fact
that GMOs posed any kind of threat,
any kind of danger.
You people, you all live in a bubble.
What do you think
the government's supposed to do...
Our government isn't supposed
to feed anyone. Farmers are.
Hey, Frankie.
I don't think this is the right time
or place for this discussion.
Come in, Lima Romeo.
Go ahead, we read you.
We just crossed
your property line with Penny.
And, Kelly, there's a soldier
making his way to the house.
- Is it Brandon?
- It sure looks like it.
Oh, my God.
Oh...
You're pretty tough
for a politician's kid. Come on.
You must've gone through a lot to get here.
Yes, sir.
Actually, I've... I've got something
that's been burning a hole in my pocket.
This belonged to a good friend of mine,
a good soldier.
How'd the recording survive the EMP?
Been told not to call it luck, so...
a miracle?
Colonel, you know with the UN Secretary
and your president getting ready
to declare martial law,
your troops must be prepared
to fire on American citizens,
whether armed or not.
Yeah, I get it.
I don't understand.
I mean, how could... how...?
Had you been willing,
you would've known
this stuff was all around.
It's not a left thing or a right thing.
Every administration for the last 50 years
has been working towards this,
whoever's stamping the executive orders.
I mean, how could they have
kept it a secret for so long?
Nothing happens by accident.
This is a smoking gun.
And I need to get back to the capital.
If you're really set on it,
you could probably do some good in Austin.
It's time to advise the governor
for Texas to secede.
Do you know what that would take?
I want you to come with me
to the radio room.
There's something I want you to hear
that'll help you make your decision.
In New York and L.A.,
FEMA camps have been set up.
Chicago looks to be going down fast,
with looters tearing up the city.
Those that haven't been detained are going
to be looking for a place of refuge.
Ian, stand by, please.
Play it.
Your president has signed
all executive orders
that gives the United Nations full control
of your country and constitution.
We have no constitution.
Ahem.
This is Lieutenant Brandon Lane,
United States Army.
The recording you just heard
was given to me by Sergeant William Hamm.
He was killed by the men
that you just heard.
Yes, sir.
There is only one thing to do, sir.
I will find Lane, I will bring him here,
and he will publicly confess to this hoax.
I'm gonna rip his throat out.
Alone again.
You're not alone.
Your dad has the truth now.
He may be our only chance.
Things are never gonna be
the same again, are they?
I don't think so.
- I'm tired.
- Hold on a sec.
Please?
Stay.
Please stay?
That's what I said to Justin.
To my mom.
That's what I said to you.
Can I remind you... you're the one
that ended things between us.
What was I supposed to do,
just... wait around while...
Yeah, you were.
Until when?
Until you came back in a body bag?
I couldn't face that.
I'm sorry, I couldn't.
I loved you.
I never stopped.
I never will.
Sergeant Timmes.
Lieutenant Lane is a... deserter.
A domestic terrorist.
Is he really worth all this suffering?
Help me stop this.
Tell me where he went.
How am I supposed to know?
You served with him for three years,
you expect me to believe that?
Go to hell.
Again.
With just a few more people
we could button this place down.
I agree, we don't need to stress our resources.
How many are you thinking?
I-I'd say three more would work.
Afghanistan, one small squad could be
more effective than an entire company.
- Sam?
- I know a guy.
J.D. He lives in town.
He's pretty set up for now.
But I'm not sure for how long.
His wife and he both serve in the military,
so they're good, she's a badass.
- Yeah, I know J.D. and Sandra.
- I volunteer. Sam already taught me how...
No.
Then what about Mr. Green?
- You said he was a farmer.
- Before that, he was a policeman.
That's a useful combination of skills.
Sam, call on J.D. and his wife.
Frankie, I'll find Mr. Green.
We've got to harden
our defences while we can.
Yeah, it'd be nice to have a bunch
of these, but it's a lot of digging.
Yeah, it is. We can handle that.
Positioned accurately,
this could be highly effective,
I think I might have an idea
on how we can get
a little extra bang for our buck
with the spider holes.
Still making killing machines
out of dental floss and toothpicks?
Always.
Uh, Frankie?
Gus, how are ya?
Oh, yeah.
J.D.? Really nice to meet you.
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
We're really glad you're here.
Thanks for having us. We're here to help.
We're stronger together.
Okay, guys, there's two primary points.
First of all is the compound
where we're located right now.
The other one is a Faraday cage,
which contains our ammunition and supplies.
Now we're talkin'.
The perimeter's secure, right?
We have fencing all the way around,
two points of entry?
Perimeter's secure. However,
we've got to guard the fence line,
because it is long, it can be
cut through or driven through.
Damn.
That's good.
Oh, hey.
- All right.
- Mama?
Uh, Mama? Mama?
- Cheers!
- America, baby.
America.
Here. Take mine.
Thank you.
That's better.
Charlie?
Why us?
Why are you taking us in?
I care about you,
and I care about your children.
The world's a different place.
Who knows what tomorrow's gonna bring?
Oh, that's hot! That's hot, that's hot!
Oh, that's hot! Oh, that's hot! Oh! Oh!
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- What the heck was that?
- That was a... miscalculation.
What...? A mi... a miscalculation?
Ah, the air pressure wasn't quite right.
- What the...?
- Sam, what is that thing?
Oh, it's a Molotov-cocktail launcher.
I call it the "Molotovenator."
Just got a couple tweaks. Wanna come see?
What?
Let's get this garden finished.
Uniform November
at the runway gate, do you copy?
Ten-four. Did you say Uniform November?
Affirmative, sector one! Approaching fast!
- How many?
- I don't know, maybe three, four vehicles.
I'm hauling ass to the gate!
United Nations, but I guarantee
this is not a social call.
Get down to section one now.
Penny, take Betty to the radio room.
Wh-where's Frankie?
- Hey, guys?
- Stall 'em.
We're getting into position.
All right, what do you want me
to stall them with, my vivacious personality?
Frankie? Gus, is Frankie with you?
Gus! I can't find Frankie.
She's gonna be okay. J.D.'s waiting
for her at the bottom of the hill.
I need you.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Stay here, okay?
Okay.
- Keep an eye on Penny.
- Sure, okay.
- You know where the guns are.
- You bet.
We're gonna teach these bastards
they can't mess with our country.
Everyone, take your positions.
My name is Colonel Kashoid,
Commander of United Nations
Special Brigade.
I'm here to arrest Lieutenant Brandon Lane
on charges of murder...
and desertion.
You ought to hand him over to me
immediately.
I'm sorry, um,
what did you say your name was?
- Kashoid.
- Gesundheit.
- This is not a joke.
- Yeah, well...
It's just your name. Kashoid!
Bad joke.
I assure you, I am not joking.
Yeah, okay, I got it,
you're serious, all right.
But I'm curious.
Who or what gave you the right
to come down here
and make these ridiculous demands?
The laws of your land by your president
and declaration of martial law.
Okay, well, I'm not an attorney, Mr. Russia,
but it'll be a hot day in Siberia
before we turn Brandon Lane over to you.
Apparently you are not caught up
on the laws your president has signed:
the National Defense Authorization Act,
Executive Order 13603,
approved by your Congress.
That's a mouthful of nonsense.
Quite frankly, I just kick ass and take names.
And I'm a part-time inventor.
I kind of suck at it, but...
I am authorized to confiscate any items
which may present a danger
to the citizens of the United Nations.
If you hand Lane over quietly,
I will confiscate these items peacefully.
And if not? Then what?
Burn the place to the ground?
Which executive order is that?
Be ready. Shoot first if they move.
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.
You did have the chance,
but you didn't take it. You failed.
Not this time.
Is that the American?
Affirmative.
He makes one wrong move,
I'm gonna kill him.
You had what it takes, Lane.
You could've been a good soldier.
Instead, you turned into a coward.
I am a good soldier.
You're the coward and a traitor.
Bring him to me!
- Timmes!
- Sorry. Ah!
You know that I will not hesitate
to paint this fence with body parts.
He cried like a baby,
he sang like a bird,
and he brought me right to you.
You now have five seconds.
- Let him go.
- Five...
four... three...
- Don't, Lieutenant!
- ...two...
Brandon!
What was that?
I'm tired of these Texans.
Crash the gates!
They're mobilizing. Hold your ground.
Man the .50 cal. I want them dead!
Good, keep firing that gun!
Bring them down! Kill them!
Kelly!
Dammit!
Hon, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
.50 cals down. Now let's show 'em
how we do it in Texas.
- Hey, you almost hit me!
- Sorry.
Just keep firing that thing!
Now let's kick some ass.
Oh, crap. You gotta be kidding me.
Cover me, guys.
Lane! Go get him, go!
I've got to find Frankie.
I'm gonna check the inner garden.
Kelly, no, please.
I'm gonna find my daughter.
Y'all got me? I'm in spider hole four.
It's me they want. Let 'em come get me.
Stay low, Frankie.
Goodbye, little girl. You're dead.
Here, land that thing!
Gus.
I had no choice.
I had no choice.
Oh, Frankie.
I had no choice.
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, honey.
- I had no choice.
- Oh, baby.
Shh...
Shh.
- Get this thing in the air.
- Yes, sir.
Get the chopper.
Go! Get this thing in the air now!
- You got this?
- Let's see what this thing can do.
There he is.
Catch him!
We gotta stay out of missile lock.
They're on your six.
Fire that missile!
Going left side.
Shit!
All right, I got eyes on 'em.
- Shoot that thing out of the air.
- I can't manoeuvre like that.
- Ah, sh...
- That's all we got.
Make it count.
All right, get me in position.
Here we are, bank right, bank right.
He's coming over the top!
Ah!
Direct hit.
Good shot, son.
Looks like we won the battle.
But the war has just begun.
Our story...
may never be recorded
in the annals of history.
And our history...
is now nothing but fond memories
of a once-great nation,
a nation founded by a legion of patriots
with a scroll of simple principles.
A nation bought and paid for by heroes
that were willing to die for her.
We are not willing to die
for a puppet government
run by demonic elite.
Jefferson was right.
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time
by the blood of tyrants and patriots."
It may not have been our choice,
but we are the new patriots.
