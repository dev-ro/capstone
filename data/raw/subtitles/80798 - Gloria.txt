Excuse me.
Look, I don't want any trouble from you.
Believe me!
It's Jeri.
What happened?
I don't want to talk in front of the kids.
What's the matter, Mom?
Nothing's the matter.
She just got the groceries.
Are the bags packed?
You got the money from the bank?
Don't talk money in front of the kids.
- You got the tickets?
- No more questions.
Where are we going?
Listen, Phil is very upset that we're leaving.
That kid is so sensitive.
I'm gonna cook dinner, okay?
No, you're not going to cook dinner.
There's no time for that now.
Then why did I go shopping?
What the hell am I supposed to be doing?
Son of a bitch packages...
The bus, I had to wait in the bad line...
...and then the bag slipped,
everything comes out. I hurt my leg.
Fuck. Son of a bitch!
Did you see anybody downstairs?
A man.
What kind of man?
A man with a shirt.
What kind of shirt?
A shirt. With shoes.
601. He's up there.
His wife just went up the elevator.
Nice staircase they got here.
What took you so long?
I got lost.
I went over the 138th Street Bridge...
...then back over the 155th Street Bridge...
...made a wrong turn past Yankee Stadium...
...the heat, traffic, people.
A lot of people on 58th Street.
All right, you're here, now let's go.
Hold this.
Hold this. Be careful.
Don't blow yourself up. You're clumsy.
Where did you go?
I went to stop downtown, at 44th Street.
They're checking on his accounts.
He's skimming off the top.
How much?
$600,000, give or take $3,000.
That's only in seven accounts.
- How do they know?
- I mentioned I don't run with the babes.
I carry pictures of the kids in my wallet.
Never mind dinner. Pack your things.
- We've been packed for two days.
- Get your things.
We haven't finished yet, can't you see...
¿ Qué quieres que lleve?
All right, leave the junk,
just take the clothes.
What clothes?
Dime qué quieres por favor. ¿Las fotos?
No!
I think the kids should eat something.
It's almost ready.
Don't argue with me, Ma.
We don't know who's coming here.
Jack told them about the kids.
He's got pictures in his wallet,
he talks about us.
Okay. Let's get the bags. Come on.
Are you sure you're sure?
- I know how sure I am.
- But not to kids.
Listen, Tommy didn't have any kids,
he was a bachelor. Jesus Christ!
You did something.
What's the matter with you?
Listen to me. I didn't do anything.
- I only made a remark.
- When?
I don't know. A couple of weeks ago.
- That's why you couldn't sleep?
- Yeah, that's why.
- Do you think they heard you?
- What do you mean? I said it out loud.
What did you say?
Listen, they asked me a question...
...I said I had it written down.
Then I said I was only kidding. Okay?
- I tried to get them not to believe me.
- You told them you had the book?
Ma, get the kids ready. We're going.
Ma, please, where are we going?
I want to know right now.
When I say we're leaving,
we're leaving right now. Move!
What am I supposed to do with this?
What the hell is this for?
I'm not going to answer.
I'm not getting my eye blown off.
Do you need help? What's wrong, Dad?
You shut up, you stupid.
You're the one that got us into all of this.
It's Gloria.
Hi. Ran out of coffee.
Come in out of the hall, hurry.
What are you doing with that gun?
What's going on here?
I think I came at a bad time.
Yeah, you came at a bad time.
You came at a terrible time.
There are men downstairs.
We have every reason to believe...
...that Jack's marked and I'm marked.
Joanie and Phil are marked.
And Margarita's marked.
You gotta take the kids, Gloria.
Jeri, you know I'd do anything for you,
but I don't like kids.
I hate kids. Especially yours.
You mind not
talking about my kids that way?
Just shut up. She's my friend.
She don't know how serious it is, all right?
Jack's an accountant for the Mob.
He finked to the FBI.
He's been skimming off the top...
...and now the kids are marked.
Okay.
I think it's a good idea, Jack.
No.
There's a gangster in the lobby.
They're right here in the building.
- I think we ought to call the police.
- Ma, just shut up, all right?
Okay, pal.
Okay, you want to come with me?
- I'm not going.
- Joan!
Stay there.
Joanie, let go of that bedpost.
I'm your mother and what I say goes.
Joan!
No, Ma, no!
- Joan, open this door.
- Come out of that bathroom.
Give me the book.
Listen to me. This book will save your life.
It's the bible. It's everything I know,
about everything in the world, understand?
It's your future. Okay? Go on.
Now listen to me, be a man.
Always be tough. Don't trust anybody.
Understand?
Yes, sir.
I love you.
Will you be safe?
Go, now.
Come on, kid.
Go!
Come on.
Go with her, now! Go on!
Go on!
I don't know what to do.
Your father told you to come with me.
So, come on.
Go!
Come on.
I got some goldfish in the bedroom.
You want to play with them?
You want to play 20 questions?
How about watching TV for a while?
- Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes.
Where's my boy?
Come on big fella, come on.
There's my baby.
Do you like him?
Do you like cats?
Phil, he wants to talk to you.
Yes, Poppy, you want me to come home?
Is my sister still there?
I love you, too.
You're the man.
Phil, you're the head of the family.
Remember that? Will you remember that?
Let me speak to her.
Let me speak to her.
He wants to speak to you,
but I want to speak to him.
Yes?
Yes, Jack, I understand now.
Hello, Poppy, this is Phil.
What's going on? Where's Mom?
I want to speak to you.
My sister.
I want my father. Poppy.
I want my father! Poppy!
I hate you, you stupid person.
You're a pig.
Check the bathroom.
Think of it...
It's like a dream, you know?
How when you go to sleep sometimes and
you get killed in a nightmare or something.
You always wake up again
knowing you're somebody else, right?
How old are you? Six?
I don't know what to do with you, kid.
My poor cat.
What do I do with you?
You're not my family, or anything.
You're just a neighbor's kid, right?
Am I right?
You better get out of here, the police...
All right, come on. Let's go.
- Let's get out of here. Let's go.
- I'm walking.
Who knows who's on the gimme, right?
I don't know.
If I'm gonna get you out of here,
I gotta have your help.
How can I help you?
They're going to kill us, you little jackass.
I don't want to die.
I saved all my life
so I could have some money.
And I got it.
You're too young to know
what making a living is, but...
...I got my money, I got my apartment,
I got my friends, my cat.
I don't want my face to look like hamburger.
Shoes...
...pictures...
...perfume.
I'm going home now.
No, you're not going home.
I have to.
What are you going to find in there,
dead bodies?
This is your father's book.
Don't let anything happen to it.
Let me go! Poppy!
Okay, listen. This is a dream.
I told you before, it's all a dream.
Nothing bad has really happened.
Now we gotta get out of here.
You're gonna walk. Okay, take a step.
Come on, kid, that's it, let's go.
Now take another step. That's good. Great.
That's it. Come on.
Stop the elevator!
Lady, get that kid out of here.
- Hold it.
- That officer said to get this kid out of here.
All right. Right out here.
Stay right here.
All right, I'll let you know
when you can go out.
All right, go ahead,
take the kid and go outside.
Go ahead.
Get that camera out of here.
Let me have my kid.
Let her go.
Come on, break it up, come on.
What a slob.
Hey, sister. I want my father.
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right, kid. It's just a dream.
That's all it is. Go on back to sleep.
They're checking us out.
Who's "they"?
I don't know. I don't know who "they" is.
Thanks, Gloria.
Is that all you want?
I'm going to go in the bathroom now.
Don't answer that telephone.
And don't go near the windows.
Or the door. If you hear anything...
...just come on in the bathroom and get me.
Knock on the door.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right. Go to the toilet.
Who would want to kill a low-income family
of four in the Bronx with shotguns?
Who would want to kidnap
their 6-year-old boy?
The family is named Dawn, they're dead.
The possible abductor's name is Gloria
Swenson, patterned after Gloria Swanson.
It wasn't a robbery, it was a Mob murder.
I'm not going with you.
I got no time to play games with you, kid.
I am the man.
Do you hear me?
I am the man. I am the man. Not you.
You're not the man. I am the man.
I'll do anything I can. I am the man!
Come on, let me see.
Come on. Come on, kid.
You are not the man.
You don't listen, you don't know anything.
You're driving me crazy.
Let me have the keys.
Gloria?
Gloria?
It's me, Gloria.
- Did you see her?
- No.
Harry, did you see her?
Where did you see her at?
I didn't see nothing.
There they are. They're down there.
How in the hell did that happen?
I didn't pass anybody.
Come out, honey.
Come here, sweetheart. Come on, Gloria.
Come here, doll.
Nobody passed me on the street.
Gloria?
Get away from that door!
Taxi!
Taxi!
Let go of me, will you?
Stop hanging on me.
Kid, listen.
The guys that killed your family...
...they're friends of mine.
Do you understand?
Do you?
My feet are falling off. I can't run any more.
What am I doing here?
I don't want to get killed.
That's it! Look, you...
Come on, you start running.
Come on, you run. Run. Go on.
Run, go on, run on home, go on!
Did you hear me?
Look, I'm not going with you. I can't.
I'm overweight, I'm out of shape.
Look, go back to your house.
We're not so far away, go on!
You've got relatives and friends.
Let them take care of you.
Go on!
I'm not taking care of you anymore.
I can't.
I can't even turn you over to the cops.
Don't you understand? I've been in jail.
You understand jail?
The people that killed your parents,
they're my friends.
I can't get involved with you.
Go on now, run.
- Gloria.
- Yes?
We're not interested in you.
All we want is the book and the kid.
Do you understand?
Sure.
Gloria, why don't you take a walk?
Look, we'll take care of that kid.
You got that book, kid? Come here.
Frank...
...what are you gonna do? Shoot
a 6-year-old Puerto Rican kid on the street?
He don't know nothing.
He don't even speak English.
Taxi!
Phil, come on, get in.
What happened over there?
That's some accident.
Yeah, we're not interested in accidents.
86th and Lexington.
You deaf?
Gloria, I'm sorry.
Listen to me.
It was all my fault.
You did it for me.
Leave it alone, will you?
Just do me a favor and don't talk anymore.
Forget about it. What the hell.
We'll go up to my bank
and take out my money...
...and we'll buy some new clothes, okay?
Here, keep it.
You know what desperate is?
No.
Here.
Stay there. Wait.
I'd like to get all my money out of the bank.
Checking or savings?
It's in a safe deposit box.
- You have to see an assistant manager.
- Goodbye.
I'd like to get into my safe deposit box.
How are you?
How am I?
I think I've helped you before, haven't I?
Oh, yeah.
Your key, please.
- What's your name?
- Ron.
I'd like to be alone with my money.
Stay there, I'll be right back.
You're out of your mind.
The word's around
you've been doing a lot of shooting.
Hurt some good people.
You've been interfering with business.
In their opinion, you should know better.
That's the word that's around.
- His mother was a friend of mine.
- So what?
You got to be out of your mind.
- Who was that?
- My uncle. Come on.
Here you are, keep the change.
That's $5. I'm getting out on this side,
so don't give me any argument.
Yes, miss?
I'm with a kid.
I realize that, but we haven't any space.
We don't want space, we want a room.
Do you have a reservation?
I'm sorry, there isn't any room.
Let's get out of here now!
Fuck! He don't know the score.
He sees a dame like you
and a guy like me... He don't know.
Yeah. We'd be better off
in a dumpier part of town.
- Okay, here are your socks. Put them on.
- No.
I feel like your mother.
You aren't my mother.
What did you say?
You aren't my mother.
My mother's beautiful.
This is our stop. Let's get off.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm a friend of Louie Saul.
He's out of town.
- I need a room.
- $2.50 a night. But it's a flophouse.
- You want it in advance or you trust me?
- $2.50. You got it?
- Where's the key?
- It's open.
- What room number?
- Any room you want. They're all open.
You make a great target
standing in that window.
Gloria, are you awake?
What's the matter now?
These neon lights are driving me crazy.
Go to sleep.
We gotta get out of here in the morning.
Blinking lights.
Do they remind you of anything?
No.
May I touch yours?
May you touch my what?
Your hair. You like me?
How could I resist you?
A body like yours,
it's a pleasure to lie in bed with you.
Do you love me?
- No, I don't even know you.
- Do you think?
What is that supposed to mean?
I don't know.
When you get older, you get tougher.
But you won't have to be scared.
Because every time there's noise
you have to be scared.
I'm not scared.
Not even of nightmares?
No, nothing.
- No dreams at all?
- No.
What do you do,
just close your eyes and black?
What is this getting to be?
You trying to embarrass me, or what?
No, I'm trying to tell you something.
I'm trying to.
What?
Have you ever been in love?
Forget it. I outweigh you 60 pounds.
So leave me alone.
What's the matter now?
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry I kept you awake last night.
Your father's book is very interesting.
I think we ought to burn it.
No!
You're so stupid sometimes.
Okay, it's your book.
I know it's my book.
So what are we going to do?
We're gonna try to get to Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh? For how long? Is it far away?
Yeah. First we're gonna stop at a cemetery.
I think you ought to say a little prayer.
Do I have to?
I said so, didn't I?
You got change for $100?
I could get it.
Take this and come back.
We'll be 15 minutes,
and then we want to go back into the city.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm glad I'm with you.
Okay, let's find a tombstone.
What town is this?
What difference does it make?
I don't understand. I don't know what to do.
What, am I going to see them?
No, they're not buried here.
We're going to pretend.
All dead people stick together anyway.
It doesn't make any difference.
I don't think I should do this. I mean...
...I don't mind.
I don't mind a lot of things...
...but this is a little gruesome.
No. You always got to say goodbye.
Dead people are...
It's like...
What's it like?
Like a ship. Did you ever see a ship sail?
No.
It's like those dreams we were talking about.
Here, these are nice. Any of these.
Those are nice stones.
Now go on up there
and you kneel down and...
...you know,
just say whatever comes into your heart.
Where are you going to be?
I'm going to be right here.
Hello. How are you? I miss you.
But then you know how I feel.
I had a dream about you
the other night and... Amen.
Nobody knows where I am.
What do you mean?
I have friends. You know.
I want to go home.
Don't be stupid. You got no home.
You got me.
I want to play stickball.
I want to go to school.
Phil.
I want to go home, Gloria.
Think of something funny.
I can't.
You? You can't think of something funny?
Anybody says anything funny to you...
...you practically split
your blood vessels laughing.
Okay. Here, keep the change.
My book!
Okay, get it.
My father's book.
Come on.
I don't want to go to Pittsburgh.
- I'm sorry, Gloria, and I'm tired.
- So what?
Excuse me. Which track for Pittsburgh?
- Miss, why don't you go to information?
- Thanks.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Amtrak Train no. 27.
Leaving at 3:00 p.m. for Washington D.C.
- My friend and I would like a table.
- This way, please.
Will this do?
- If it's the best you got.
- Yeah.
Relax.
I don't know what's going on.
Nothing's going right.
Thanks.
Can I have a piece of pie?
What kind of pie?
Apple with vanilla ice cream.
We don't have apple.
- Then what do you have?
- Peach.
Okay. I'll have peach with vanilla ice cream.
What to drink?
- I'll have a Coke.
- He'll have milk.
I don't want milk.
- He'll have milk and I'll have a cup of coffee.
- Black or regular?
- Milk and sugar on the side.
- Milk and sugar on the side.
Take a walk.
What's funny? My nose?
No. You're so tough.
I'm tough?
I don't mean "tough."
So strong.
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.
If you wanted to split up, it's okay with me.
Just don't be phony. I hate that.
We'll split up.
What's that supposed to be, a threat?
You can't even carry my bag.
You can't even speak English.
You can't even remember that book.
You can't even speak English.
Okay.
And you don't know enough
to apologize when you're wrong.
You don't listen. And you're rude.
- I'm rude?
- That's right.
That's a laugh.
What happened to my pie?
And my vanilla ice cream?
You want it?
Take a walk.
Give me the book. Hand it to me.
Give it to me and shut up!
Now here's the book.
Here's what you've been looking for.
I'm Gloria. I've got my hand on a gun.
I want to make a deal.
You want to make a deal?
I can't make that decision.
Why not?
Because I don't trust these guys
and I'm not Mr. Tanzini.
Okay, you want it?
Tanzini, huh? You want it?
Okay, guys.
This is your option. You got two.
I got a 6-year-old kid over there,
doesn't know his ass is up.
Had his whole family murdered
by you punks.
Empty them in that.
Do it!
In the bag.
In the purse.
What's the matter?
What are they gonna do?
All right, pick the pieces up.
Let's wait outside.
They'll wait for us outside.
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know. Shut up.
There's a back way out.
Just sit there until I think of something.
Run! I'll lead the way.
Don't worry about it.
- This way.
- No, come on, this way.
Get over here! This way! Get in there!
I'm telling you, it's this way.
Kid. Go on.
Kill me!
Phil...
...time to go.
What happened? You have a pain?
Was that the car? Did it scare you?
I just realized I'm doing the wrong thing.
I should be sending you to boarding school.
Okay.
Anyway, you're not Spanish like me.
You're not my mother, you're not my father,
you're not anyone to me.
You're not enough for me.
Okay, Gloria?
So, I'm gonna find a family.
Some new friends, and a girlfriend, too.
- Okay.
- You're a nice girl, but you're not for me.
Fine.
See that bar across the street?
I'm going to be in there, having a drink.
You want to join me, fine.
If you don't, you want to run away...
...that's your problem.
'Bye, chiquita. 'Bye, little sucker.
'Bye, little insect. 'Bye, little fly.
'Bye, little tiny insect.
'Bye, sucker.
Wake up, that's all for you, Beanie.
I don't want any headaches.
- Can I help you, miss?
- Yeah.
Give me a beer.
Any particular kind?
Cold.
- Nice and cold.
- Thank you.
You got the time?
8:30.
You open early.
Every morning. 8:00 a.m.
Bartender, I can't look, for whatever reason,
I can't tell you what it is, but...
Look over there.
Is there a kid coming in this way...
...or standing across the street?
Forget it.
I'm leaving that for luck.
Have a nice day.
Okay, just keep going down Broadway.
Nice and slow.
I'm looking for somebody, okay?
Take a left up here.
There are a lot of Puerto Ricans
in New York.
I don't imagine there are too many
6-year-old Puerto Ricans though.
Is your name Crubbs?
Come on. Your father home?
- Can I have a quarter?
- Just give us the money.
Get your hands off me, kid. Beat it!
- Come on, a quarter.
- A quarter.
Whatever we do, we do together.
We're not interested in that, kid.
Al, do me a favor. Take a walk.
He's okay now.
Go to your room. Take your kid out of here.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Who do you think it is?
Are you mad at me?
Mad at you? No.
Frank, are we mad at him?
I don't get mad at kids.
All we're going to do is take him for a ride.
That's all. Upstairs.
You're stupid.
You did the same thing to his father
as they did to mine.
Had to shoot me with a Magnum.
Okay.
Are you kidding?
Okay, you bananas, inside.
Move it!
Phil, right here, next to me.
Get going, suckers.
There are women and kids here.
- Don't be stupid, will you?
- Hold it.
There are women and kids here.
Move!
Freeze! Get out here, kid.
Dames in the bedroom.
That's it.
I want the sissy out here,
up against the wall.
Right here.
Don't do it, fella,
unless you're sick of your friend here.
Okay. I'm reaching.
Coming up.
Okay, inside, punk.
Are you with that dame?
Because I'll kill you.
Okay, back in the bedroom.
You, out here.
Come on. Let me see that purse.
Back in the bedroom.
Okay, wise guy, your turn.
Okay, give me your piece.
Give me your piece.
All right. Here.
That's it.
Okay, back in the toilet.
Okay, everybody in the bathroom.
Everybody in the bathroom. Everybody.
Shut the door.
In 20 seconds...
...I'm going to start shooting
through that door.
High, jerks, so get down on your stomachs.
Gloria, what are you doing?
I'm saving your life, stupid.
Now pick up those guns.
Move it!
Move!
Move it!
You double-crossing little rat! Move it!
Come on, in the cab
down there at the end of the street.
Come on.
Come on. I'd love it. Come on.
Don't hang back, I'd love it. Love it.
Get in that cab.
Get in.
Don't lose her.
Think they're gonna scare us, did they?
You know, it's not pleasant killing a woman.
Hey, fellas, here.
This is it right here. Driver, stop.
Out.
You, give me your hand.
You got it, baby.
I know I'm a lot of trouble.
No, you're no trouble.
I mean, I walk into a roomful of hoods.
A guy pulls a gun on me
and you side with him.
You shot my friend's father.
I'll kill anybody that's trying to kill me.
You're right.
Then you wouldn't take the gun,
then you didn't want to leave.
So where's your loyalty?
Where's my what?
I can't anymore in this local.
Come on, let's get the express.
Come on. Excuse me.
Did I tell you to come on?
Get over here.
Get off at 42nd Street.
42nd Street.
What?
What?
I don't understand.
What are you doing?
- Get off of me.
- Leave her alone.
Be cool.
Let go of me.
Go ahead, try me.
You'll love it. Okay?
Sissies.
You let a woman beat you, huh?
You little tiny nothings.
You punk!
Go ahead, punk!
Come on. Go. Move!
I want two tickets to...
Excuse me.
When's the next train to Harrisburg?
This place is making me nervous.
Let's go to a hotel and get a night's sleep.
Okay.
- You hungry, kid?
- No. I'm just tired.
Yeah, me too, kid.
Boy, they got everything covered.
Trains, planes.
I don't know.
Maybe Pittsburgh's connected, too.
Who knows?
They gotta have gangsters
in Pittsburgh, too.
They don't.
Here it is.
Don't be scared.
I got my gun.
It's nothing for me
to blow someone's brains out, believe me.
I just hope it's someone I know.
I'm with you, Gloria.
Get in the bathroom. Get in there!
- Who is it?
- It's me, bellman.
We have our bags.
I have some flowers.
Compliments of the house.
You want me to put these in water for you?
Everything all right?
- Everything is not all right.
- What's wrong?
Thank you.
Take a load off your feet.
Gloria, you won't believe this,
but I'm growing up fast.
The first time I met you,
I didn't know nothing.
I was ashamed to talk.
We can't go on like this.
What's the matter?
Unpack my clothes, will you?
And run a hot bath, I want to steam them.
You want to take a bath first?
You must stink by now.
No, I hate baths.
Don't worry, kid.
All this hopeless, stinking mess.
I asked you once if I could be your mother.
You didn't want that.
You want to be my mother?
You could be my mother.
I don't have any mother, no more mother.
So you could be my mother.
Why would you want to be my mother?
I don't know.
Just want to clear things up.
You're my mother. You're my father.
You're my mother.
You're my whole family.
You're even my friend, Gloria.
You're my girlfriend, too.
Well, I'd like to be family.
You think they're gonna catch us, huh?
I don't know. Probably.
You can't beat the system.
What's the system?
System?
I don't know.
Then how do you know you can't beat it?
Not too many people have.
Then have some people did?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
Hey, Gloria, we gotta try.
Even if we get shot.
You can't just keep on shooting everybody...
that goes knocking on your door.
Go to bed.
Sure. We'll have a good night's sleep.
Wake up tomorrow.
You'll think of something.
Yeah.
- Want me to turn off the light?
- Yeah, turn off the light.
Aren't you coming to bed?
No, I'm going to take a bath.
You go to sleep.
I only have a $100 bill.
Forget it.
Forget it?
Take the donuts, take everything. Go.
Okay. Thanks.
Hey Gloria.
Hey Sill, how are you?
Long time.
- What's up?
- What's up with you, baby?
Just leaving.
See you, buddy.
Move over.
Where to?
Go down two blocks, take a left.
Go another block and take a left again.
That's a one-way, lady.
Then go one more block.
You're looking good, Gloria.
Where you been?
Give me a break, Sill.
Come on, Gloria, give it up, will you?
It's all over.
Hey, there's no place for you to go.
Look, I take you in now,
it means a lot of money to me.
It could make me a big man.
Help! Get your hands off me.
Take your hands off me, you fat bastard!
What the hell are you doing?
Why don't you turn around?
You look like an ape.
Get out of my cab, mister.
Get out of the cab.
Now, take it easy, big fella.
What do I owe you?
I don't want your money.
Take a walk and don't get back in the cab.
And don't lean on the cab.
Don't lean on the cab.
What's wrong? What's the matter?
I gotta make a phone call.
Operator, I'd like to call 477-9970.
9970.
Yes, I hear it's busy.
Don't call me back.
I'll call you in a couple of seconds, okay?
So, who are you calling?
Phil, listen to me now.
I'm going to call Tanzini.
Who is that?
Give me a chance, will you?
To be your partner.
I mean, what am I for?
He's an old friend.
He's a Mob guy.
We used to live together.
He was your boyfriend?
Let me call this guy. Okay?
Operator, I'd like to try
that 477-9970 again, please.
- It's ringing.
- Do you trust this guy?
Tony? Gloria.
How are you?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Never mind where I am.
Can you help me?
Don't tell me, "It depends."
I don't want to hear, "It depends."
I'm going to bring the book, Tony.
I'm fine. How are you?
You got fat?
Yeah, I love you, too.
I don't want to say when. But soon.
What happens if he doesn't help you?
I gotta take the book, Phil.
What happens if he double-crosses you?
He won't. I know him.
What happens if he kills you?
Look, I'd better give you some money.
I only got $100s.
I tried to get some change this morning,
but I couldn't.
Now take this $100. You get change.
Take the rest of these
and you stuff them down inside your socks.
Don't tell anybody you got them.
You're a kid
and they'll steal them from you.
You wait here three hours.
If I'm not back by then, beat it.
You'll be back, won't you?
Yeah.
I'll be back. Bank on it.
Three hours.
Maybe I should wait three and a half?
Okay, three and a half, but no more.
If I'm not back in three and a half hours,
it doesn't mean I'm dead.
It means I'm gonna meet you
in the train station in Pittsburgh.
You understand?
I love you, Gloria. I love you to death.
Thanks.
Bolt it.
One, two, three...
...four and a half.
One, two, three...
...and a half.
What time do you have?
9:02, exactly.
To the button.
What time do you have now?
It's still 9:20.
- I hope you got change for $100.
- You're kidding.
Forget it. Just wait for me.
Tony's expecting me.
Got a million bucks in this slow elevator.
Mr. T...
...Gloria's on the way up.
Come in, please.
Excuse me, could you wait, please?
It doesn't matter to me.
Any way you want to do it.
It's up to him.
Excuse me, she's here.
I don't want to see her now. Let her wait.
She has the book.
Put her inside. She can wait.
We don't want to be disturbed.
Please.
- Would you like coffee?
- No.
- La frutta è pronta?
- Un secondo.
- Who?
- Harvey.
- Everything all right?
- Go home.
Excuse me.
Where is the child?
Gloria, you are a smart girl.
You understand.
I like children.
I don't want to kill children.
Those weren't murders that we did.
You understand that?
Yes, I do.
The killings were made to set an example.
Where is the boy?
He's on a boat to South America.
Gloria, trust me.
Maybe we can do something.
Trust you?
Tony, I know you.
You know the rules.
Tony, it's me, remember?
I know I'm a policy.
I'm not Gloria anymore. I know that.
You got a minute?
Smoke a cigarette with me, will you?
Well, hello.
Sorry to meet you guys.
Long as you're here,
why don't you sit down?
This is Gloria.
A lot of money, which Gloria knows,
as she's one of us, has been jeopardized.
Let me tell you about this kid.
I know you all approve of mothers.
I know you all had mothers.
Me, I'm not a mother.
I'm one of those sensations.
I was always a broad.
Can't stand the sight of milk.
Okay, I know you guys
are going to have your day.
But maybe I could have a drink?
Do you think I could have a drink?
L'Chaim.
Nice girl.
Tell me about the boy.
Kill me.
What are you trying to say, Gloria?
Life is very dear.
Do you think I want to kill you?
I made love with you.
I bought you jewels.
He made a mistake.
He knew names, dates, money,
account numbers...
...and he wrote it all down in that book.
Did you read the book?
Yeah, I read the book.
Popeye, Mickey Mouse. So what?
The father turned state's evidence.
He was talking to FBI, CIA. Big mouth.
He hurt a lot of people.
People that liked him.
The boy didn't see the murder.
He was with me.
I don't like this kid.
You can't go around shooting our people.
Every time we try to talk to you,
you pull a gun.
You killed people. People get angry.
I understand. You are a woman.
He is a little boy. You fall in love.
Every woman is a mother. You love him.
I love Phil?
We need the boy.
This kid is...
...and I'm just saying this because
I don't know what the hell else to say...
...he's a very smart...
...you know, an ingenious guy...
...that I think is one of the greatest guys
I ever slept with, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I know.
You want to shoot me, go ahead shoot.
I hope I'm not holding you up.
Tony, you know I don't want to be tortured.
So if you're a friend of mine,
just do it quick, okay?
Tell you what, Mr. T.
I'm going to get up, walk out of here now.
You want to stop me, you can.
She's leaving.
Tell her to shoot that sucker.
Give me the Magnum.
Hello.
Are you the man in 310 A?
Yes, I am the man.
This is the desk.
We want to know if you're checking out.
I don't know.
All right, then you'll be keeping the room?
Yes.
We'll be staying here for two days.
Fine. We're just checking.
Can I have change for this, please?
How do you want it?
All $5 bills and five $1 bills.
Pittsburgh.
Only passengers with reserved tickets
on this train are permitted to board.
Boarding on track no. 8. Thank you.
So where you going?
I don't know.
I've never been to Pittsburgh before.
I think I was supposed to take a later train.
Maybe you can call them.
They're at the cemetery.
Which cemetery is that?
I forgot the name of it.
Carson Memorial?
That's it.
That's a long way from here.
Want me to give you a lift?
No, thanks. You're a very nice man.
Want to wait for me?
I want to go back to town.
How much money do you have?
Buddy, don't worry about it. I have money.
Is that enough,
or is it going to cost me more?
Hello, Gloria. How are you?
I miss you.
But I know you're dead.
And I want you to know
that I know you're dead.
Anyway, give my love to my family.
And I know you'll be seeing each other.
My mother loved you anyway...
...even though I didn't till now.
I made it to Pittsburgh, and... Amen.
Aren't you gonna kiss your grandmother?
