Following months of high
rainfall the river Seine
begins to rise more rapidly
than normal.
Over the course of the
last week thousands of
Parisians living nearby the river
have already evacuated.
To continue moving throughout the
city, residents travel by boat, or across
a series of wooden walkways built
by Parisians themselves.
The water reaches a height of
20 feet above the normal.
The Eiffel Tower has wet feet and it's
only on the Montmartre Hill that
that people could stay a little dry...
Emile, hey!
Over here...!
Let me take that.
Thanks.
You know, Emile, I only have one regret.
You do...? What?
Well, it took you two years
to ask me for a date.
I was scared you'd say no.
Oh, Emile, I wish I had known!
All that time wasted.
Maud, my darling, don't let
your mind dwell on that.
The past is passed,
the future is ours.
Nothing... nothing can come
between us now...
Haha... it's show time...!
What do you got?
It's a dragon!
What on earth does a dragon
doing in France?
What on earth does a dragon
doing on earth?
Oh, no!
Come on
'Monster in Paris'
Hello Raoul!
Well hello, Maud, look at you.
Petite as always.
That's such a lovely dress.
What is that? Kind of an eggplant?
Oh, thank you, I think it's
more of a purple.
More of an eggplant, I think.
Is Emile in? I have something for him...
Oh, I guess is... like an eggplant.
Oh, the new movie has come.
He'll be so excited, it's his idol.
- Hey Emile... - Hey
Raoul... - Catch this!
That's embarrassing...
Come on, come on, quick...
Okay, I'm not looking.
Can't see anything now.
Going somewhere, Emile?
I have to go to Barby's
to find a new belt.
- Obviously...
- Oh, no no no... no...
A belt for my projector.
Since when do you put pants
on your projector?
- Pants on my projector?
- Yeah, because you... never mind.
Do you need a lift?
It's on my route. Catherine is right.
How...! Catherine! Come on!
Could you stop that?
Sorry... come here!
I... swell, see you later...
at the screening?
Yes, yes, yes, you will...
You know, Maud...
I, I... I was wondering.
If, if you don't mind...
Maybe... maybe you would...
Yes! Of course I would.
You would?
Yes, I will gladly take that reel back
to your room, no problem.
Aah, yes, that...
Yes, of course, I mean... thank you.
I.. over him. Thank you, Maud!
Anything else, Emile?
Yes...
Well, I... I... I thought perhaps...
if after... the screen...
Emile, buddy, let's shake a leg.
I'm on a schedule here!
You'll have plenty of time to woo
Maud when you're back.
Bye!
- Well... Thank you very much Raoul.
- Well, you're very welcome, Emile.
Eh... for what?.
But I, I was talking to her
and you ruined it.
You little devil!
You finally decided to ask
her out, didn't you?
No, it's so complicated.
What's so complicated?
You ask her out... she swoons...
she says yes... She swoon back.
You're sealed,
you're on a date.
It is not that simple...
Everytime I see her, my tongue kind
of gets glued on top of my mouth.
Which is why you write her a letter.
Only thing you have to glue
then is an envelope.
There?
That's not a bad idea.
Of course it's not a bad idea.
It's a great idea.
I had it. I'll help you if you want.
- I get a way with words, as you know.
- Of that I do know.
But do you know much about love?
Do I? O-oh... oh you are adorable...
Do I know about love?
Do you have any idea what
they say around Paris?
When Raoul is on the prowl,
the kiddy cats all... meow...
- Oh, that does rhyme...
- It better than rhymes, my friend.
Hello, Madame, I hope you're not
feeling too scrambled today.
Where are... where are my eggs?
It's not that I don't trust you Raoul,
but the way you drive,
I figured it is saver to deliver the eggs
with a little padding.
- Aah...
- Great.
Raoul, are you okay?
No complaining... just allergies.
Sorry, honey!
You drive very fast!
I know...! Ever since Catherine
runs on sunflowers oil, she really flies!
Speaking of flies, your coat...
it's very itchy.
It feels like... straw?
Straw? Are you kidding?
What I paid for this?
Huh-oh, Emile... This is genuine
one hundred percent...
Rare.
Thank you Raoul.
Don't mention it, big man...
See you later...
Hey! Watch where you're going!
Here! A brand new secondhand belt.
Anything else?
- Maybe.
- She's a beauty, isn't she?
Oh... yes.
What's that?
What is that? That is the future.
No! That!
Is it straw?
No, okay, now... back to the future.
You see, no more blisters,
no more dirty clothes...
All comfort, no effort.
That's the future.
Okay, but what does it do?
What does it do?
It does...
Well... Bye bye now, thank you.
- Thank you!
- Bye!
Oh... I can't... oh, look...
That's my camera!
Why... he's running away...!
Thief...! Thief!
My camera!
You're not supposed to do that.
Fantastic!
It works great yesterday.
Okay, maybe if I just press...
One
Two
And it's supposed to do that?
Ra-Raoul, thank you, thank you so much.
You saved my life...
I did?
Yes... look!
And three, and I meant to do that.
Now we're all nice and warmed up.
Let's deliver those babies.
I don't know if I can.
It's just I don't want to be late.
Don't worry, we're gonna
get there in a flash.
Wow...!
You gonna know the Professor
is a real character,
way ahead of his time, a real visionary,
a little like myself.
Too bad he never lets me see his work.
Maybe he's shy.
Yes, maybe...
Professor!
Oh, apparently very shy.
Okay, what do we got? Dear Raoul,
I am in New York for a conference.
Just leave the peat outside.
In my absence, Charles will take care of it.
Who's Charles?
Charles.. go on.
Oh... oh, Charles, assistant botanist.
Hello Charles.
Charles, now let's get those bags inside.
We don't want them to get wet,
right Charles?
What? Okay, now that you're inside
just leave the peat at the door.
Whatever you do,
don't...! touch anything
Thank you, good day...!
Okay... okay! Forget it.
Charles seems to know you pretty well.
Yeah... yeah.
Another job well done,
for peat's sake, right?
Because it's peat, you get it?
You get it... pete's sake?
You're a monkey...
Alright, ready for a quick tour?
But the monkey said we're
not supposed to.
Monkey said, come on... you could film it.
Imagine your own jungle movie.
I play the bright explorer...
what do you think?
You think I could?
...Haha... you are... Yeah, of course!
Let's go do it!
Right... we call him...
let's call him Jeff.
With my companion Charlie, we're
going to save this damsel
from the dark regions of the jungle...
God Almighty... look at that monster!
- What?
What kind of tree is that?
Well that, Emile, is an extremist
Gigantis Circus, you know...Sparagus..
Actually it's a Sequoia...
- Sequoia, yeah... you call it a Sequoia?
- You prefer the generic name?
Oh my God... look at that.
It's the Professor's work...
Emile, Emile...
come and get a shot of me.
Okay... what do we have here...
do not use? Let's see what it does...
- Are you filming?
- Yes... but it's just to...
No, no, of course...
Right... okay... next...
How about this one?
Atomize a Tune, Atomize a Tune...
Good name... out of love...
for more melodious voice.
It's incredible! That's amazing...
Charles has a lovely singing voice.
Alright, let's try this one.
Super fertilizer...
Unstable... okay... now what I
need is a little seed,
and this charge here, a tiny drop
or two and then we wait...
We continue to wait...
And we wait.
Next one...
This one's a dud...
Maybe you need to water it.
It's a good idea, Emile...
Very disappointing, Professor...
Okay... Next.
Why not invent anything
that actually works...?
Did you get that?
I did... all of it.
Sunflower that big must
produce tons of oil!
This could cut Catherine's
fuel budget by ten!
Emile, this must be my lucky day!
Emile!
Raoul...? Raoul...!
Raoul, you're okay?
Yeah, yeah...
I think the coat saved my life...
Emile... Emile!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Oh... Good... good.
Charles, where's Charles?
Charles?
Right! Good! Charles is fine,
you're fine,
I'm fine. The plants are fine,
everything's fine.
So... we'll be going now...
Goodnight! It's been a pleasure.
Raoul, you didn't see something
strange in there, did you?
You mean besides a singing monkey,
a fifty foot sunflower,
and vials of potion that almost killed us?
No... you see anything?
You mean you didn't see a 7 foot
creature with big red bug-eyes,
4 arms and spikes all over his body?
Emile, I think somebody has been
watching too many movies.
Do you think?
Yes, my friend...
Eh... say Madame Carlotta, have you
told Lucille about my songs yet?
Water goes where water goes...
What do they think I am... Moses?
Am I supposed to make miracles?
Er... no, but perhaps some boats,
more walkways,
shelters for the poor... blankets.
Forget blankets!
What's needed here is... diversion.
Oh, yes, perfect, we can divert the water...
Not water, Pâté... their minds...!
We need to get their minds out of
the wet and on to something big!
Something that will wash this headline
away and replace it with something
that will grab their imagination...
Like what?
I don't know... something that will have
some pizzaz... something that will POP!
- Wow...!
- No...
Don't give me that...
What...? Not my fault... whatever...
Commissioner Maynott, Captain Pâté...
I trust everything is to your liking?
Oh yes, my dear Carlotta... yes...
Yes, of course it is, isn't it?
One step from perfection...
all that is needed.
Now is for your angel, the niece,
to accept my invitation...
with my compliments.
Oh, commissioner, what an honor.
I'm sure she'll be delighted...
Speak of the devil...
She's resplendent, so confident
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
I realize I'm hypnotized
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
I hear the moon singin' a tune
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
Is she devine? Is it the wine?
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
I don't know, don't know,
so don't ask me why
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
I don't know, don't know,
so don't ask me why
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
I don't know, don't know,
so don't ask me why
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
That's how we love,
the Seine and I
Not interested...
Everybody needs somebody, even you!
You look at the commissioner,
he's successful, he's a national figure.
He's pompous...
- He has a medal of honor...
- He's boring...
People respect him.
He's got nice hair... oh,
I love his hair.
He smells good, doesn't he?
He's attractive.
He's not my type!
Not your type!
Okay, maybe not yet.
But you meet him, you're nice...
and he becomes your type.
Perhaps you smile that wonderful
smile of yours, and who knows?
Come on, Let me see it.
Ah! Perfect.
What a singer...
...and what a woman!
What do you mean 'what a woman'?
I'm wondering... would you be jealous?
- Oh, dear...
- What?
I'll take care of that.
What's wrong?
Uhh... Something touched me..!
Oh... don't worry, dear.
It won't attack a larger animal.
Run...?
...No no no no... aagh...!
...Run... run...!
Oh, horrible!
Seven feet tall!
Razor sharp teeth!
Horrible! Yeah, of course...
Sign here.
How's it going with that sketch?
- Wait
- He's gettin' good, huh?
Let's see here...
what could rhyme
with great destiny?
Ah yes... I know... me!
Come in.
Pâté, what in the world
are you wearing?
It's all part of a new fitness
campaign for lead officers.
I have agreed to lead the rapid
response bicycle unit.
Brilliant...
Anything new?
Well... It's just is a theory, but...
Here is where the store window
was smashed.
Yeah...
Here is where the children
were traumatized.
Okay...
Here is where the horse was stampeded
through the lingerie shaft.
See what I'm getting at?
Actually... no.
There is a pattern,
a logical progression...
leading... all the way to... here!
And...?
Well, I would like permission to do a
more thorough investigation... Sir.
Yes, of course.
Investigate away!
Let the public see that we
are men of action.
Thank you, Sir, thank you.
But don't be too quick at
solving the case, Pâté.
But, Sir, I should think the
quicker the better.
We are on the verge of a catastrophy.
Well you see catastrophy...
I see opportunity.
You see, my dear captain?
When people are frightened
they need protection.
They need someone that they can turn to.
Someone to believe in... a saviour.
A hero!
In other words, they need... me!
- Can you say hello for me?
- Sure.
No, don't... you don't have to... no,
I mean... well, if you...
- Okay...
- Well, anything... darling, wait... stop...
Let me take a look!
Oh... perfect!
What's that?
A strange creature has been seen
in the streets of Paris...
the beast is 7 feet high, is extremely
hairy and has 2 big and red eyes...
Under those circumstances we recommend
all citizens not to go out alone at night...
Oh, great...
Be cautious and do not panic...
You scared me!
What are you doing here?
You scared me and I'm working here.
Well, I hope nothing is broken.
No, I'm fine...
Talking about the champagne,
you idiot!
Look at me, I'm a mess!
There comes the drama Queen.
Come on, it's nothing...
Give me that, you're making it worse!
Oh, great! Now I have to change again.
Not a bad idea.
Brown is definitely not your color.
I see... you're an fashion expert now.
Very credible with that straw coat on.
It's not straw.
I see, nothing has changed... still the same
bird brain when you're in first grade.
And you're still... so are you!
What a repartee...!
'What a repartee'
'I'm so smart, I use words like repartee'
Look at me, look at how amazing I am. "
'I'm so dumb. Oh, I'd fell on my butt again'
- 'I'm a star, I'm a Princess, but I sing like'
- A frog!
- Oh... I get it.
- You get what?
You're jealous.
Oh yeah, I'm jealous.
You're jealous of my success...
then makes you feel small.
- Listen, honey.
- Don't you 'honey' me.
Listen, honey...
I'm doing just fine, okay.
Women like me.
Men want to be me.
Men want to be with the
women who like me.
...and the women eh...
want to be...
the men that want to
be with me... eh
I'm popular and creative.
Creative?
You mean that piece of junk?
Don't you... don't you dare
bring Catherine into this...
If you want to see popular and creative,
come see my show one night.
Ah, wait... you can't...
We don't accept losers...
Ah... good one. Oh, pardon me,
you royal pain in the butt.
I didn't realize you had to win the medal of
honor to gain entrance to the cheese hall.
In your case, the only way
you will be admitted
is if you show up with that medal
pinned to your chest.
It would look great on your
lovely straw coat.
It's not! It's not! ...it's not straw...
Ah... and one more thing.
If you come with that medal,
the best table would
be waiting along
with all the champagne you
can drink. On the house!
Albert, can you come and
get the champagne instead?
- I'm in the bath room!
- Now! - Okay... okay...
Bastard!
There is a monster in Paris!
People are scared...
Give me one!
Here...
Thanks...
How is it going over there?
I'm close...
Let's see... okay...
Wait a minute, what is this?
Oh, my God...
This is a nightmare...
Aah... Emile, it is a nightmare!
I've lost all my clients.
What's that?
It... it's the monster!
The monster that we created.
Yes, our own monster!
He's got your eyes and wide hairy legs!
What are we gonna do?
Everything's fine, nothing happened...
It's not our fault.
Besides, nobody knows we were there.
Could've been anybody...
could've been anybody..
Sorry to interrupt the show, gentlemen...
But I think you're about to be
the stars of the next feature...
It's called the interrogation.
The way I see it, humanity is divided
in two different categories...
The faceless and nameless masses,
living their lives like cockroaches...
And those with... with a great destiny...
those like you... and me...
You're very kind, commissioner,
but I'm just a singer.
Wow, don't be modest, you see, I'm...
I'm due to inaugerate the new railway.
Everybody will talk about it and I
would be honored to have you
open the event and stand by my side,
because you're not just a singer.
You're a star...
shining brighter than all others...
lighting the way to a...
a brilliant future...
for you, for me, for us...
That's very nice of you,
but don't you think it's a little
early to refer to us as 'us'?
Excuse me...
Yes, Pâté...
- I don't mean to interrupt, but I have
extremely important news.
- What?
The monster... I have three suspects.
Now if you look very closely...
right here,
just before the explosion,
see that little black dot?
It's a flea from the monkey's fur.
I believe that the combination of
these potions... turned it into...
the monster.
Bravo, Pâté! Bravo...!
A giant flea! This is exactly what
I've been looking for... Ha ha ha ha...!
Excuse me, Sir...
I'm just starting out life...
I don't want to go to jail.
Prison is a little growth market
for home deliveries.
Arrest the monkey! It was his flea...
Prison? Who said anything about prison?
This is a story about heroes!
Heroes don't go to prison.
But, Sir, they are guilty.
Guilty of what?
Of giving me a chance to show
the public where they can
place their trust?
No, no! They do not deserve to go to prison.
They deserve to be celebrated...
to be honored.
They deserve...
- Huh?
- Here... pick one.
Well, would you have a medal of
honor in there, by any chance... huh?
When I can take no more,
I take a great big snore...
I fall asleep that Easter and wake
up at Easter, one year later..!
So?
Eh... right.
Thank you,Albert...
I... look, I'll be honest with you.
What... you don't like that one?
This one perhaps.
Albert... Albert!
The song isn't the problem.
What is the problem, then?
I have a talent!
All my friends say so. All I need is
someone to give me a big break. That's all!
That... or some new friends.
It's just me, but I have to go, sweetie,
but I have to run.
You'll tell me about it, right?
Tell you what?
You know, how it went with the commissioner.
Right?
Oh... right...
Okay, good... I can't wait.
- Look... Albert, thank you.
- Don't bother.
I know, I'm too original for a place
like this. Too avant garde.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
- That's what I am.
- That's what you are.
- So avant garde.
- Of course you are.
- So out of here.
- Bye now.
She is jealous, that's what she is.
She's stuck in a little bourgeois
dance hall tunes,
while I'm blazing a trail...
It scares her!
True talent scares her...
Who's there?
Open the door! Open up!
It's me, Albert, open the door!
Help!
Listen, Albert...
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Did I hurt you?
I am really sorry.
Let me see.
No...! Let me go!
Let me go!
It's a nightmare...
I'll wake up... I'll wake up... I'll wake up!
I hide my light inside
a cloak of night
Beneath the red scarf
and a chapeaux
The pearl of my heart
locked within a shell
too afraid to let it go,
to let it show
and all the headlines read
for the whole world to see
A Monster in Paris
I fall apart, I fall apart,
apparently
I did appear beneath the light
yes it was me
A Monster in Paris
I hide my pain inside a melody
its as if notes I sing
will set me free
I keep all my dreams
under a lock and key
Im so afraid that they
will fly, away from me
A Monster in Paris
A Monster in Paris
A Monster in Paris...
Do you... do you have a name?
How about Francoeur?
It means honest heart...
Follow me...
There... be patient.
I'm nearly done.
Wait here... alright.
This... okay...
Oh! That could work.
Why not... why not?
What about this one?
Hmm... too eccentric.
I know.
Don't move... don't move.
Almost done.
There you go.
Sorry... Your arms, Francoeur.
There!
Perfect. The police will never
recognize you now.
Now... if you'll excuse me,
it's my turn.
Are you okay?
That's called the guitar.
It's very hard to play.
There's a surprise for you
out front, sweetie.
I'll be right there.
Whatever you do, don't make a sound.
Okay? I'll be right back.
- Good evening, miss Lucille.
- Good evening.
Well, well... twinkle twinkle, little Star.
What are you doing here?
Oh, my dear. We came to see
your so-called... show.
Say, Emile. What's that on your lapel?
Oh, I do believe it's the
Medal of Honor, Raoul.
Well, Emile, what a coincidence.
I happen to have one too.
What? Where did you steal this?
No, no, we didn't steal them.
They're from commissioner Maynott.
Really?
Hold on... wait, what is that?
Do you hear something? I hear a voice:
'If you get the medal of honor you'll
get the best seat in the house'
Sound familiar?
- Albert!
- What?
Show these gentlemen to the
best seat in the house.
Why me?
Enjoy the show, if you even
know what you're watching.
Bye...
Emm... You two know each other?
Ohh... yes.
I mean, uh... yes.
...Oohh, he's such a...
- Francoeur, what...?
- Darling, he's brilliant.
- I can explain.
- Genius, there's no explanation, my dear.
I've never been so transported.
Where did you find him?
He... just pop in.
Well, he is a perfect fit for your
sweet, sweet voice.
I'm going to inform the rest
of the musicians.
- I really don't think...
- History will be made tonight.
I can feel it.
What part of 'don't make a sound'
did you not understand?
Thank you my good man, thank you.
Don't mention it.
C'mon, buddy, relax... loose the coat.
Now... okay.
Oh, what's this?
' Dear Maud... '
Don't! Give me that.
Darn! You took amy advice!
You darn let him to get it in you...
Give me that now!
No, no no no no...!
I'd really like...
Stop reading that.
- Date?
- No...
Where?
I don't know,
just please give me that back...
I will tell everyone that you're
in love with Lucille...!
Are you crazy?
Me, that woman?
How can you even think that?
- It's so obvious.
- You're so obvious.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Francoeur...
it's with the greatest pleasure...
Hurry!
that I give to you...
Francoeur... move!
Lucille...!
Good evening!
Welcome to the 'Rare Bird'.
It's... it's so good to see you out tonight.
We're... delighted to introduce
a brilliant new talent,
the master of the guitar all the
way from... somewhere else.
The supreme virtuoso, Mr. Francoeur...!
Go on, sit with the band.
You'll be fine.
She's resplendent, so confident
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
I realize I'm hypnotized
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
I hear the moon singing a tune
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
Is she devine? Is it the wine?
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
I don't know, don't know,
so don't ask me why
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
I don't know, don't know,
so don't ask me why
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
I feel alive when I'm beside
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
From this angle like an angel
La Seine, La Seine, La Seine
I don't know, don't know,
so don't ask me why
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
I don't know, don't know,
so don't ask me why
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
Upon the bridge
My heart does beat
Between the waves
We will be saved
The air we breathe
Can you believe?
Learn to forgive
upon the bridge
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
That's how we are,
the Seine and I
You are amazing!
Success like that deserves...
the feathers.
I... I,m sorry...
Ah... tell you what I don't deserve...
You!
Look... Lucille, I just really
wanted to say...
I thought that the high notes
were... were high,
the low notes were... low, and
you know, the whole thing was a...
it was a... you know... it was a...
Magic!
Yeah, exactly! It was magic.
And you... you
You are... huge!
It was really very good, miss Lucille.
Thank you.
Eh... sir...?
Ouch! Hey! Hey, that hurts!
Ssst! What do you mean?
It... it's the... the Monster!
He's not a monster...
What about the eyewitnesses?
And all the destruction?
When people panicked they
say all sorts of things.
He may be a giant flea,
but he won't hurt even any fly.
Look at him.
And his voice, have you ever
heard anything so sweet?
Eh... we have once...
Yeah... by a monkey.
Oh, honey bee...! Are you ready?
You are back in 2 minutes...
I'll be right there!
Wonderful sweetheart, don't be too long.
Why... I guess he does look pretty
laid back for a monster...
Yes, Emile, okay, here's what we do...
We introduce him to the commissioner
tomorrow at the press conference.
We clear the entire thing up.
What do you think?
What press conference?
I will pulverize... I will crush it!
Send it back to hell from
whence it came.
Ah, commissioner,
how do you propose to kill it?
Why...? With... with water!
See... fleas cannot not live in water.
At the moment, as fate would have it,
Paris is full of water...
which is why I have not moved more
aggresively to drain the streets.
Water is my weapon of choice...
When I find the beast,
I will take and drown it.
Commissioner... commissioner,
very commendable.
But how are you going to drown the
monster when you can't even find it?
Oh, I will find it, alright.
As a matter of fact I am using
this press conference to announce
a reward for the first person
to offer any information that
leads to the discovery
and death of this menace to
our peace and happiness...
- Eh... Sir...
- Yes...
I have information...
Excellent, excellent, please... come up.
Oh, that little rat! He's the one
who's gonna get drowned
when I get my hands on him.
We'll never get there before the police.
Are you kidding? There is no one alive
who can beat Raoul when he drives...
- Oh, Emile!
- Maud!
I heard about how brave you were...
- You did?
- Yeah, with that Medal of Honor, huh?
- It was nothing.
- I don't think so.
- Emile!
- Yea... yeah... I'm coming!
- I have to go... but... for you!
- Emile!
Duty calls...
Dear Maud... I'd really like a date...
Saturday, 3:00 PM.
Yours affectionately, Emile...
Saturday, 3:00 PM, but... where?
C'mon... let's go!
To the Cabaret...
Ah, a monkey... this is not
Noah's ark, you know.
Look, sweetheart, I didn't come to argue
with you, I came to save you.
- Save me?
- Let's go...
Maynott, police...
- The Police what...?
- Yeagh!
Hurry up! In here...
Commissioner! What a surprise!
For both of us, where is he?
- Who?
- The Monster!
Oww! You're hurting me.
Not as much as you have hurt me.
Your words carry no weight
with me any longer.
Now let's stop this little charade
and at least have one moment
of true honesty between us.
- Where is it?
- Where is what?
Ah, Sir, it's in there...
First you accuse me without
a shred of evidence,
then you violate my private property...
If you dare to enter my dressing room,
You will have to find another singer...
Consider it done!
Nothing here...
We've searched all over, Sir... nothing.
- Really?
- I told you.
I'm eh... I'm confused...
I do not know what to say.
- I do, thank you.
- Thank you...?
For putting the public safety
before your own,
leading the charge to rid the streets
of Paris of this terrible danger,
wherever it may take you...
It was right here!
I have heard it!
Arrest him!
But... wha... what have I done?
What have you done?
Lying to the police.
Bearing false witness,
malicious intent...
Do you want me to go on...!?
Take him away...!
I didn't do anything...!
My dear, I am mortified...
You thought we're doing the right thing.
I would not blame you if you do not
sing at the inaugeration, how...
Of course, I will sing. If for nothing
else, to show you my support
and admiration for all you
have done for us.
Oh... oh, thank you, Mademoiselle.
- Enjoy your day...
- And you.
Francoeur, Raoul...
Okay, it's safe now.
You can come out.
Aah, Francoeur... there you are!
Bravo, Lucille...
I like your acting skills...
Well, he can hide in my
projection room.
No one ever goes up there...
Until they do, and then we
want to move him again...
We need a more permanent solution.
Here... take that!
God... that hurts!
Only if we could shrink him down
to his normal size...
Then no one will ever find him!
The smaller you are the less
people look at you.
At least this has been my experience...
There is only one person that
could save Francoeur,
and he is in New York right now.
Huhuh...but we don't need him...
Lucille, no offense. We're talking
big time science here, okay?
All I know is deliveries.
Emile's all about movies...
You're an expert at show business,
but, you know...
Exactly.
- I see, smart girl.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, will someone tell me
what you two are talking about?
Ladies and gentlemen,
come and see Paris from above...
An uplifting experience!
I...fellow citizens ... 
...along with this marvel I bring
you something else...
I bring you Hope!
I bring you... Me!
And so, it is with great pride,
great expectation
that I announce my candidacy
for the post of mayor of Paris!
But before I take on this
momentous task,
it is my great, great pleasure
to present you...
a symbol of this current greatness.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... Lucille!
The angel of Montmartre.
Lucille!
My head was in the clouds
and not a soul around
In the blossom of youth
so I live from the roofs
of Paris
as my bicycle flew
down the avenue
my heart could sing
because it give me wings
Wow...
Got it?
- Sir, sir!
- Not now!
I say... not now.
But Commissioner, it's the
antidote for the monster!
I've found it at the Professor's lab.
May I see that?
Did you not hear my speech?
I am the antidote!
Scram!
Oh my God! It's is the Monster!
Over there!
No...!
Oh, I'm scared...!
Oh, no! Don't shoot!
You'll hit my angel.
The antidote!
Throw it!
Hey! Look, everybody.
It's the monster
shrunk back to its flea size...!
- Oh, yes, kill him!
- For sure!
The monster is dead, long live our hero!
Long live Mayor Maynott...!
- Bravo!
- Long live Mayor Maynott!
Why... why thank you, thank you.
I am thrilled, thank you, thank you.
... not at all... not at all...
- Commissioner!
- Yes...
No...!
Pâté... open the trap door.
I've been fooled...!
Francoeur! Get out of here!
- Jump! Jump! Yeah, this is it...
Hurry up... you must get out of here.
Out of the way!
Move!
Ugh... What?
See you down below!
What are you waiting for?
Go and get him! Now!
Raul, come on!
- Hey!
- Ready?
- Raoul... if we die, I'll kill you...!
- Okay.
Hold that car back up!
Impossible Sir,
the system is automated.
Once the doors are closed,
you can't stop it.
Can't back up, eh, okay...
Well, then... it will go down.
Let's go get Catherine.
- Raoul...?
- Oh, no...
Hahahaha...!
Lucille...?
Yeah and what about Raoul?
Come on... he'll find us.
My bike!
There you are... did you miss me?
You hear that...!
Thief...!
Give me that!
Hurry up!
My position!
Do you want to be a poster boy
for the cycle core?
Well, here is your big chance...
Start... pedalling!
Hey! Your ticket please...
- Stop that bus!
- Excuse us.
There you are...
Come on!
Welcome aboard!
Here he comes!
Raoul...
Oh, my... are you okay?
Don't! Am I hurt...
Let's put him in the back.
Okay... hold on!
You're under arrest. Don't move!
Guys, guys, guys... we got to go!
Get in, quick... let's go!
Come on... shake a leg. Shake a leg!
Stop right there, don't move!
They're here, Raoul...
Come on!
- Okay.
- Come on, hurry up.
Onward... onward, man...
Charles...?
Got you!
Show me some I.D.!
Pardon me...
What... what, what are you doing?
Your coat!
It's okay.
It was straw anyway...
Oh, you thought you would
escape me, did you? Haha!
- Emile?
- Yes.
Can you get rid of that thing?
On the... out there?
- Please.
- Okay.
Emile... Emile... be careful!
Pâté!
I need a bigger weapon!
Of course, perfect.
To the Seine.
To the Seine, Pâté, to the Seine!
I'll happily take you there, little lady,
but there'is no one up there...
There will be.
I'm sure of it.
Faster, Pâté!
Imagine you within the Tour de France!
I never plan in doing the Tour de France, Sir.
It's too tough...
Precisely, it's easier.
There are no mountains.
Yeah! Head on, man, head on!
The wheels are useless!
I can't do it.
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my goods...
Francoeur!
Quick! We have to help him!
We have to help ourselves first.
We're sinking!
Emile! Emile!
Aah... oh, I know.
Here we go...
One... one... one...
Sorry, but we're still sinking.
Maybe, but we're moving.
Up, down, up, down...
Get us down, Pâté.
Get us down!
Trying my best, Sir...
Your best is not good enough!
And voila!
Safe and sound and dry.
Thanks to the great team,
Raoul and Catherine.
Catherine! No! No... no... no...
- Emile!
- Maud! What are you...
You know the monster that
everyone is talking about?
He's here!
No, no, no... don't worry Maud.
We are here to protect him.
You protect a monster?
- Come on, Romeo.
- Yeah, I'm coming.
I will be right back for you.
Wherever you go, I'm going!
It's no good, Sir.
You're hopeless!
- I have to do everything myself.
- Sir.
I don't mean to tell you
what to do, Sir.
But don't you think, I mean,
we should reconsider.
I mean that... that creature never
really hurt anybody!
That's not the point... Why are you
talking in that ridiculous voice?
It's the Helium, Sir.
The monster stands between me
and the City Hall!
He dies... and I win!
Francoeur!
Are you okay?
O- oh...
Come on, quick... quick!
Step aside, Lucille...
Go ahead! Shoot!
Don't... tempt me...
The newspapers were right.
There is a monster in Paris and
I'm looking right at him.
What? Haha... have it your way...
Ohh... I'm hit... and down.
I'm okay, I'm okay!
Go! Francoeur...go!
Go...!
No, no, no... Lucille!
No...!
- Raoul!
- Hold on, Lucille.
- Raoul!
- I'm here...
Stop right now!
Of course... yes sir...
Oh... oh... Emile, are you okay?
What are you doin'?
Hold on, Lucille, I'm coming!
Emile... it's okay, it's over.
Let me help you...
You know what, Maud?
I am very upset.
For the first time, I'm gonna
do something about it.
Eh... may I borrow that, please?
Almost there, okay?
Don't worry, everything
is gonna be alright, okay?
Lucille... I'm right here.
Oh, no...
Oh, no... we're gonna die!
Give me that, you dwarf...
I may be a dwarf,
but I have a big gun.
Actually, the gun is pretty small.
Now, now give it to me!
You leave my Emile alone!
No, no... stop!
You want to play the heroes?
Give me my gun, or over she goes...
Okay, okay, no... here.
Use your gun.
We each have our destiny.
Yours lies in the shadow.
And mine is out in the spotlight.
- A brooch.
- Hey?
Wait...
Hey!
Okay, Maynott, it's show time!
Maud, close your eyes.
Emile, you're wonderful,
just like in my dreams...
In your dreams?
Francoeur!
Where are you?
Where are you!
I killed... I killed the monster!
Commissioner.
Oh... oh... Pâté, hello...
- I have a message from the Interior Minister.
- Message?
He's not happy with all the destruction
caused by your psychopatic chase
in pursuit of your own ambition.
But as everyone can plainly see,
I have, I have risked my life...
Pâté... I've slain the monster.
Tell that to the minister!
With pleasure... Victor Maynott,
I'm arresting you for the premeditated
murder of Monsieur Francoeur.
What?
Have you lost your mind?
The opposite.
I was so set in being a loyal officer,
Sir, I did not see the road you've
been taken us down.
I needed a flea to show me the way.
Are you mad?
It was just a miserable little flea!
You were so inept, Sir.
There was more humanity in that flea
than in the louse... I see before me now!
Take him away!
See my face wet with tears
and running down my cheeks
washing all of my fears
like rain upon the streams
I'm a monster but my heart's
is passionate and profound
and I will sing like April showers
singing till my final hours
up here everything's clear
I'm looking at the wing
I know we've done so much that you
will know the meaning of
this thing that we... offer
so the end of this poem
if it really has moral
this boogeyman wants
you to know
that love is in the soul...
Lucille...?
Listen, listen to them.
They all love you.
I can't, Raoul...
Of course you can...
you were born to sing, Lucille.
If you don't do it for them or Emile,
do it for him...
- Okay?
- Uh..
Come on...!
Francoeur...?
- He's here...
- Huh?
Too thin, unbearable, never again
Even if I change it the sound
will be the same
We have a tendency to be ashame
Let me tell you how they help me
bring me all of these changes
Just a little kiss will do...
Just a little kiss will do...
Don't you know it is enough
to woo me
And every Quasimodo will
return on the scene
Okay, let's go...
It's so easy like a simple talk
It's no more complicated
than a simple 'hello... '
Raoul, come dance with us.
Excuse me, would you like to dance?
I love it, Commissioner!
Come in...!
Lucille, there's something
I've got to tell you.
Ever since first grade... I've always
...oh, boy... I've always... eh... mean it.
I love you too, you idiot!
- I... what?
- Ever since we met.
- But you... you took my toy!
- I was hoping you would come to get it back.
- Re... really?
- Yes.
- You mean you... you love me?
- Uhuh...
This is the greatest day of my life...
- You still have it, right?
- Huhm...
