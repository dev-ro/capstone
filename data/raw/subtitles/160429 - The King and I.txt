THE KING AND I
Moonshee, please...
...come back.
You're going to get in trouble
with your master.
Here!
Moonshee, please!
Hold on!
I'll get you!
Louis!
Here, Moonshee.
Quickly, pull!
Hang on, Louis!
Mother, Moonshee was so afraid.
I should've known it was your fault.
Louis, are you all right?
So, she's coming.
The King's new schoolteacher.
Guess what she brings?
Homework? Pop quizzes?
Those Little pink slips they give you
when you're tardy? I hate those.
Progress, you fool.
Master Little's teeth. Work of art.
No more superstition.
No more fear. No more--
You.
There will always be me.
I will be ruler of Siam...
...you understand?
And no schoolteacher is going to....
I'll use this English schoolteacher...
...to help me dethrone the King.
Schoolteacher want to get rid of King, too?
I get it, O Conniving One.
No, you don't.
No, I don't get it. You're right.
But you going to explain to me now?
I'll cleverly convince her...
...that our King is a cruel...
...primitive, merciless barbarian!
You very spooky.
She'll write home to the British...
...begging them
to have the King removed...
...and someone more civilized...
...be made ruler in his place.
Such as?
Missed spot.
Such as?
You, you. You...
...good for job.
And not a moment to lose. Terror is toxic.
This storm has created doubts.
A perfect setting for my powers of illusion
Let's show them something truly barbaric.
Give me gong.
What is it, Mother?
I don't know.
What is it?
Mother, what are you doing?
-I'm whistling.
-Whistling?
That's what I do when I'm afraid.
"Whenever I feel afraid
"I hold my head erect
"And whistle a happy tune
"So no one will suspect
"I'm afraid
"While shivering in my shoes
"I strike a careless pose
"And whistle a happy tune
"And no one ever knows afraid
"The result of this deception
"Is very strange to tell
"For when I fool the people I fear
"I myself as well
"I whistle a happy tune
"And every single time
"The happiness in the tune
"Convinces me that I'm not afraid
"Make believe you're brave
"And the trick will take you far
"You may be as brave
"As you make believe you are
"You may be as brave
"As you make believe you are
"I whistle a happy tune
"And every single time
"The happiness in the tune
"Convinces me that I'm not afraid
"Make believe you're brave
"And the trick will take you far
"You may be as brave
"As you make believe you are
"You may be as brave
"As you make believe you are"
I think this whistling
is a very good idea, Mother.
A very good idea.
it is a good idea, isn't it?
I don't think I Shall ever be afraid again.
"I don't think I Shall ever be
afraid again."
Oh, yes, you will.
Have a squint, lad.
Bangkok's out there.
Not you!
"Is that the King?
His prime minister, the Kra√£ahome.
He has the power that can be used for...
...or against you.
I'd be less outspoken
than your normal self.
Just friendly advice, ma'am.
A thousand welcomes to Siam.
I trust the seas were calm?
Perfectly, thank you.
Have you friends in Bangkok?
I know no one at all.
Then if you need anything, please...
...turn to me.
Oh, no!
Goodbye, Moonshee.
I'll miss you.
Well, maybe you should take
the useless creature.
I really wanted a ship's cat...
...to eat rats.
Can I? Thanks.
You took a tooth from me, too?
Your time will come, monkey.
I know torture.
Poor lad.
He'll need a friend in that palace.
"Whenever I afraid"
Catchy tune. Where did I hear that one?
You'll be shown to your quarters.
I was promised a house of my own...
...outside the palace.
Kings do not always remember
what they promise.
Then I will remind the King.
I Shall take nothing less
than what I have been promised.
You will tell the King this?
I will tell the King this.
it will be an interesting meeting.
Me know this one.
Burma sends a gift to the King of Siam.
Gift?
Sometimes rugs, once a cuckoo clock.
This time, her.
That girl?
She's a person, not a rug!
A barbaric old custom.
The King loves it.
tell the King what useful thing can you do.
I can....
Go on. Go on!
I can read, Your Majesty.
Oh, goodness.
in Siam, books are forbidden to servants.
infinite pardons, Your Majesty.
She can arrange flowers.
Stop it!
Stop!
Who, who, who?
I am so sorry, Your Majesty.
He meant no harm.
Never hide behind woman's skirt.
"is not brave.
Also, impossible to know
when she sit down.
I am Anna Leonowens, Your Majesty...
...the schoolteacher you sent for.
-Now, there's a matter we must settle.
-Yes, yes. You are part of my plan...
...bringing to Siam what is good
in Western culture.
Come, come, come.
Lab of science.
Press for printing.
First modern Siamese book.
short History of royal Family.
Author: myself.
Unfortunately, is long family.
That sounds interesting.
Also experimenting with engine...
...of steam on road of steel.
Ancient Siamese firework.
Shoot from top of palace.
Am thinking of rocket.
How clever.
Pride and joy.
Air travel is future.
Louis, look.
Quickly, go, go!
Please, Little teeth, don't fall out.
still working on details.
Everything very scientific here.
Except you.
You do not look like teacher.
How old Shall you be?
A hundred and fifty years, Your Majesty.
in what year were you birthed?
In 1712, Your Majesty.
How many years Shall you be married?
Several, Your Majesty.
How many grandchildren Shall you have?
How many, how many?
Perhaps bad manners to ask
many questions of such old lady.
I appreciate the concern, Your Majesty.
But now I have a question.
I will tell when is time for question.
No, Your Majesty.
I agreed to teach in the palace,
but there's the matter of my house.
You promised a place where I may go
in the evening when my duties are over.
What you wish to do in evening
that cannot be done in palace?
I won't have soldiers at my door...
...etcetera, etcetera.
What is this "etcetera"?
Well, Your Majesty, it means
"all the rest."
Good.
Have children prepare for presentation...
...etcetera.
I want my house.
The house I was promised, Your Majesty.
You teach in palace, you live in palace.
I did try to warn you.
Stop!
Those are my belongings!
I am sure a brave young man like you...
...would enjoy a visit to the armory.
Absolutely!
There you are, Moonshee!
lf the boy gets hurt...
...the King will be blamed.
Don't worry. Master Little will protect--
You idiot.
Yeah, I got you. We going to mess him up.
That scare me.
Okay, that's better.
Where did you come from?
A hunter did this, I bet.
I Shall call you...
...Tusker.
Enough.
Yes, Crown Prince.
Who are you?
An object.
Like rug given to King.
His Majesty receives many gifts.
And if I displease in any way...
...I'll be sent back to Burma.
You know what such dishonor means?
Death.
Are you soldier?
l....
-You don't know what you are?
-l...
...serve the King.
That makes two of us.
Two servants.
Welcome to your rooms, Mrs. Anna.
it's beautiful.
Please don't unpack. I'm not staying.
What are they doing?
They wonder why you wear a tent.
They think you are shaped like that.
Look.
Two legs.
No, please.
Your husband. A great love?
He was. it can happen...
...even to a schoolteacher.
Though I suspect...
...only once in a lifetime.
Servant girl and Crown Prince...
...is forbidden!
Against tradition!
But love has nothing to do with tradition.
"Hello, young lovers, whoever you are
"I hope your troubles are few
"all my good wishes
"go with you tonight
"I've been in love like you
"Be brave, young lovers
"and follow your star
"Be brave and faithful
"and true
"Cling very close
"to each other tonight
"I've been in love like you
"I know how it feels
"to have wings on your heels
"And to fly down a street in a trance
"You fly down a street
"on the chance that you'll meet
"And you meet
"not really by chance
"Don't cry, young lovers
"whatever you do
"Don't cry because I'm alone
"all of my memories
"are happy tonight
"I've had a love of my own
" had a love of my own
"like yours
"I've had a love
"of my own"
Go ahead, go ahead. Look around.
Feel free to touch any sharp,
pointy object you see.
You'd have to be brave
to face one of those.
Darn it all.
These things still...
...work. Sorry.
Good thing Master Little so Little.
Look at this.
This would really hurt.
Stupid monkey.
Thanks.
all right, you villain.
Take this right now.
Are you all right?
Escape, just escape. Go on.
Watch this!
A-E-l-O-U...
...and sometimes Y.
What you looking at?
You never seen man pinned to wall
with six knives before?
No. Cool.
What are you doing? No climbing allowed.
That's great!
Can you show me the cannons now?
I'm kind of tied up at the moment...
...but why not?
Rama. Sit.
Children come for presentment.
Where is schoolteacher?
Your Majesty? I'm not staying.
Silence! You will stand here...
...and meet royal children.
Very well, Your Majesty.
But then I'm leaving.
The royal prince and princesses.
What?
Prince Chululongkorn.
Our schoolteacher has changed her mind.
will live in palace.
For the time being, Your Majesty.
Perfect.
-Take a letter.
-"P" for promotion?
A letter to the British!
Can't you do anything right?
I want to dictate!
"To Sir Edward Ramsey, British envoy:
"Your schoolteacher
is in grave danger," etcetera.
"Etcetera."
"Is that a secret code,
O Great Communicator?
Give it to me.
Paper cut.
And how's our Little...
...crop coming along?
I must say, though,
your son is a bit of a disappointment.
When I start an ivory trade, you'll be...
...the first.
I thought the King won't allow ivory....
I got it, O Corporate One.
-We going to be rich, aren't we?
-Well...
...I am, at least.
Stingy.
Master Little need money.
He starving, he losing weight....
Make sure this goes straight
to our British friend, Sir Edward Ramsey.
And now that I think of it...
...I'll use your tusk...
...for my royal pendant.
Homeward bound, at last.
Fair winds all the way, Sir Edward.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Tea?
Why, thank you. Sir Edward?
Sir Edward,
there's a letter for you from Siam.
Really?
Follow that letter!
What's this?
My dear Anna Leonowens...
...in danger?
Change course, Captain.
But, Sir Edward, where to?
Siam.
To dethrone a barbaric...
...king.
For your room, Mrs. Anna.
How lovely.
You must have something in return.
No, Mrs. Anna.
You will be punished
for giving books to servant.
Nonsense. I'm a teacher.
Oh, dear.
And I'm supposed to be teaching
this very minute.
"Be it ever so humble
"There's no place like home
"Be it ever so humble
"There's no place like home"
Take your places, please.
I have a surprise.
A new modern British map.
Siam is not so small.
But look.
England's even smaller.
But royal palace
is center of whole universe.
I suppose we all think our home
is the most important place...
...whether we live in a palace or not.
Who does not live in palace, Mrs. Anna?
-Just outside the palace walls--
-Outside?
You've never been outside?
No.
Really?
Then, come. I'll show you.
King will be angry.
No, he won't.
He has brought me here to teach you.
You like us?
Very much.
"It's a very ancient saying
"But a true and honest thought
"That if you become a teacher
"By your pupils you'll be taught
"As a teacher I've been learning
"You'll forgive me if I boast
"And I've now become an expert
"On the subject
"I like most"
Getting to know you.
"Getting to know you
"Getting to know all about you
"Getting to like you
"Getting to hope you like me
"Getting to know you
"Putting it my way
"but nicely
"You are precisely
"my cup of tea
"Getting to know you
"Getting to feel free and easy
"When I am with you

Princess Ying.

"Things I'm learning about you
"Day by day"
Do not look so worried, Rama.
Remember: Cat always land on feet.
Your Majesty.
Always so modern, totally innovative...
...in science and education.
Schoolteacher is doing good job.
Because of example set by Your Majesty.
So experimental...
...and daring.
Yes, I am daring.
I mean...
...Your Majesty's idea
of breaking ancient tradition...
...sending the royal children...
...outside the palace.
What? What? What?
Royal children outside palace?
Your Majesty didn't know?
imagine that.
When can we go back?
Now, children.
Thank you, Mrs. Anna.
What? What? What?
You have been outside palace?
I thought it important they learn
how people live outside the palace.
I will say what is important!
tell me something you learned.
There are nice Little houses
outside palace, Father.
Every day something about house
outside palace!
Your Majesty did promise me
a brick residence...
...adjacent to the royal palace.
I remember your very words.
I will do remembering.
Who is king here?
I do not know of any promises.
I do not know of anything
except that you are my servant.
No, Your Majesty.
indeed, I am not your servant.
And if you don't give me
the house you promised...
...I Shall return to England.
it is my pleasure you stay here.
You stay here in palace!
in palace!
I cannot stay in a country
where a promise has no meaning.
Where there's talk of great changes...
...but everything remains
according to the wishes of one man!
You will say no more.
I will say no more because...
...I have no more to say.
I tried to tell you.
Sometimes he's so unreasonable...
...so barbaric.
Don't worry.
I'll make things good.
Don't bother.
I'm leaving.
I thought you were magnificent,
Your Majesty.
Every inch a king.
I tell you when is time to think.
World today...
...is so large.
No man big enough to be alone.
"No man big enough"?
Not even a king?
King different. King need no one.
Nobody at all...
...I think.
"Your servant! Your servant!
"indeed I'm not your servant
"Although you give me less
than servant's pay
"I'm a free and independent employee
"Employee
"Shall I tell you what I think of you?
"You're spoiled
"You're a conscientious worker
"But you're spoiled
"Giving credit where it's due
"There is much I like in you
"But it's also very true
"That you're spoiled
"all that bowing and kowtowing
"To remind you of your royalty
"I find a most disgusting exhibition
"I wouldn't ask a Siamese cat
"To demonstrate his loyalty
"By taking that ridiculous position
"How would you like it if you were a man
"Playing the part of a toad?
"Crawling around
"on your elbows and knees
"Eating the dust in the road
"Toads! Toads!
"all of your people are toads
"Yes, Your Majesty
"No, Your Majesty
"tell us how low to go, Your Majesty
"Make some more decrees, Your Majesty
"Don't let us up off our knees
"Your Majesty
"Give us a kick if you please,Your Majesty
"Give us a kick if you would, Your Majesty
"Oh, that was good
"Your Majesty"
Father, you seem so angry with changes.
How can Siam be modern
if you keep to old ways?
"Old ways"? What, what?
Well...
...example:
Would you, a modern, scientific king...
...like in old dark days...
...still choose a wife for your son?
Of course. As my father did.
How can boy be wise enough
to select good wife?
"Is possible.
"Is not way of King. So I believe.
"Believe"?
You do not know?
I know.
Some day you, too, will know everything.
When do I know that I know everything?
When you are king.
The royal pendant.
From tusk of first sacred white elephant..
...thousand years ago.
But, Father, is for king to wear.
Now future king will wear.
You wear. You wear.
Father...
...as future king...
...I believe I should have right
to choose wife.
-impossible.
-But if I love someone....
Love has nothing to do with tradition.
What to say to growing son?
I do not know. I am not sure of anything.
I pray for guidance.
Perfect. He doubts himself.
Now my powers will work.
Man the gong.
When you're the king
and I'm the Kralaholo....
First, I'm going to change the name.
I'm going to have a servant
to hit the gong for me.
Someone really tall and really stupid.
This makes flossing easier.
"When I was a boy
"World was better spot
"What was so was so
"What was not was not
"Now I am a man
"World have changed a lot
"Some things nearly so
"Others nearly not

"That, as a student
I have studied to procure

"Of which I wish I was more certain

""Is a puzzlement
"When my father was a king
"He was a king who knew
exactly what he knew
"And his brain was not a thing
"Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to

"And be willfully immovable and strong
"Or is better to be right?
"Or am I right when I believe

Prayer so peaceful.
I hate pets.

The ship will sail, Moonshee.
I don't want you left behind.
Come on, Moonshee!
Once again...
...undefeated kickboxing champion of Siam.
That's because you're the King's son.
-No one will hit you.
-What?
-I'll try, if you want.
-You are too young.
You'll get hurt.
Come on. Let's have a go at it.
I saw how it's done.
-Jab! Jab, jab!
-Stop.
-Kick, kick!
-I warn you.
it was just a lucky punch.
Honest! You're really good.

You are...

Would have been better.

Perfect.
What is it?
Someone is here.
I have feeling someone watching us.
Please, go. Please.
King has bad news.
"Is very troubled.
Go to him.
Prince in love with servant girl.
That's a big no-no.
Wait till I tell the Kralahome.
He going to be so pleased with me.
He's going to--
What this stupid thing in my way?
You going to die!
You are so stupid.
Mrs. Anna, I am worried.
You, please, will go to my father?
-He sent for me?
-No.
But he would be glad to see you.
His mind is filled with problems.
What kind of problems?
Letter to British say Father is barbarian.
The British coming
to make Siam protectorate.
Put new king in his place.
That's outrageous.
Your father is many things...
...but he is not a barbarian.
Then, you will help?
You mean, give advice?
King cannot ask advice.
And I cannot...
...will not,
give it without having been asked.
Mrs. Anna. Please, I read letter.
Come. Come.
"Dear Friend and Teacher:
"Do not go away.
"We are like one blind.
"Do not let us fall down in darkness.
"Lead us in right road.
"Please.
"Your loving student...
"...Princess Ying."
You have come to apologize.
-I am sorry, Your Majesty, but I have--
-Good! I accept.
Have you no respect for King?
No head Shall be higher than King.
I cannot stand all the time.
You mean on the floor?
You are very difficult woman...
...but you will observe your head
Shall never be higher than mine.
lf I sit, you sit.
lf I kneel, you kneel,
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
"Is promise?
Very well, Your Majesty.
""Is promise."
Anything you wish to discuss?
Why would I discuss with you?
Well, then I Shall go.
Good night, Your Majesty.
Good night.
-Your Majesty?
-What, what, what?
Has there been any...
...news recently?
News? Yes, there were news!
-They call me barbarian!
-Who?
Certain parties
who wish to steal my country.
lf you be Queen Victoria...
...and somebody tell you I am barbarian...
-...do you believe it?
-But it's a lie.
A false lie!
And what have you decided to do about it?
You guess what I will do.
Guess.
He'll fight the British gunboat.
Cannon against spears.
And guess who'll win?
I believe...
-...you'll not battle the British.
-What?
I believe you'll invite the British
to the palace...
...to show the truth
by putting your best foot forward.
Right best foot.
it's just an expression, Your Majesty.
Yes, well, show them truth.
That is exactly what I have decided to do.
But how?
Guess how I Shall cleverly do this?
By entertaining the British with a banquet?
Just as I intended.
Are you snooping?
lf there's one thing I will not tolerate
in this palace it's snoopery!
Show them how civilized you are...
...and they'll report to the Queen
you're not a barbarian.
I will display most scientific experiment.
Air travel.
-And a ball.
-Exactly what I have in mind.
-With music.
-And dancing.
Yes, Your Majesty, dancing.
Why do you not think of dancing?
An inspired idea, Your Majesty.
You will arrange.
May I ask how much time I have?
-One week.
-One week?
First ask help from Buddha. Come, come.
Bow. Bow, bow.
"Oh, Buddha...
"...give us the aid of your strength...
"...and your wisdom.
"Buddha...
"...help Mrs. Anna to keep awake...
"..for scientific preparation of banquet..
"...even though she be only a woman...
"...and a Christian,
and therefore unworthy of your interest."
Your Majesty.
A promise is a promise.
Your head Shall never be higher than mine.
A promise.
"And Buddha...
"...I promise you...
"...I Shall give this unworthy woman...
"...a house.
"A house of her own.
"A brick residence...
"...outside royal palace...
"...according to agreement...
"...etcetera, etcetera...
"...etcetera."
Little elephant.
You still there?
I hope I never see another mango in life.
You mess with Master Little?
That shut you up?
No, no.
Master Little not ready to rumble.
Special pain for you.
So it's you again.
No way.
Where have you been?
Making fruit salad?
You've seen what?
The Prince?
Whistling.
Nobody kisses me, ever!
He gave away...
...the royal pendant.
To who?
Who, who, who?
Sounds like.... Nose?
Toes?
Rose?
The Little flower girl?
That would be a fun game
to play at parties, you know.
Never mind. it would never work.
Good. A perfect dish for the banquet.
The British watching over the King's
every move and surprise, surprise...
...a servant girl has the royal pendant.
What can His Majesty do...
...but sentence her to a barbaric death?
Everything is best foot?
Everything is ready.
Herewith Shall be list of subjects
on which...
...I am very brilliant
and will make great impression.
This is what you Shall be wearing?
Why, yes. Your Majesty.
Do you like it?
Are you certain is customary...
...etcetera, etcetera...
...etcetera?
I am sorry His Majesty does not approve.
I did not say I do not approve.
in England, women dressed like that...
...dance in arms of men
not their husbands?
I would not permit.
it's very exciting when you're young...
and you're sitting on a small gilt chair.
...your eyes cast down...
...terrified that you'll be a wallflower.
Suddenly, you see two black shoes...
...a face, and it speaks....
"Shall we dance?
"On a bright cloud of music
"Shall we fly?
"Shall we dance?
"Shall we then say goodnight
"and mean goodbye?
"Or perchance
"When the last Little star has left the sky
"Shall we still be together
"With our arms around each other?
"And Shall you be my new romance?
"On the clear understanding
"That this kind of thing can happen
"Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
"Shall we--"
Why do you stop?
Your Majesty, I didn't realize I was....
After all, in my country...
...a girl would not dance alone
while others were looking on.
But you will dance with strange man
holding hands, etcetera, etcetera.
Not always a strange man.
Sometimes, a very good friend.
Really?
Yes. But at the moment,
he's pretending to be civilized.
I'll see through that.
We're so lucky you came to save us.
Anna, are you and Louis all right?
I had no idea it would be you.
Pack your things.
I'm concerned for your well-being.
Really, Edward, no need.
I'll be the judge of that.
I've been assured this king is a barbarian.
Who, who, who?
A dear friend.
Sir Edward Ramsey, Your Majesty.
We knew each other before I was married.
Dinner. Afterwards, dancing.
Dinner?
Dancing?
A banquet...
...in your honor.
in that case...
...we'd best go in.
Yes.
Better be going in.
Don't even try.
Edward, did you know His Majesty's family
is the subject of a book?
-Really? l--
-Yes.
A short history. Written by self.
But long family, taller than British.
Also have hot-air machine for flying.
isn't that unnatural?
You know,
His Majesty is a man of many interests.
He's kindly offered elephants...
...to help President Abraham Lincoln
win his civil war.
Really?
Yes. They have no elephants
in forests of America.
Must be very poor country.
in Siam, you know...
...the white elephant
is sacred to the royal family.
Quite rare, so I believe.
Yes. its value is symbolized in a pendant..
...worn at all times by the King.
Now future king wear. Show.
Father.
Show!
One hopes His Young Highness
has not been...
...too generous.
You gave away?
Father, may we discuss this privately?
Who, who, who?
Your Majesty, surely this is not the time.
No, no. Please, no!
Dishonor!
Servant girl and Prince!
Forbidden. Dishonor, dishonor.
Do as custom demand.
Your Majesty!
Whipped...
...till death.
No!
You cannot mean....
Would be better if teacher understand
this matter does not concern her!
Outrageous.
Your Majesty,
don't throw away all you've done.
This girl hurt your vanity,
but she didn't hurt your heart.
lf you do this...
...you haven't got a heart!
Silence. I am king, as I was born to be!
And Siam to be governed in my way,
not your way!
There is no barbarian worse
than weak king.
And I am strong king, do you hear?
Strong.
I cannot believe you'll do this.
You will believe when you hear whip
as you run down the hall.
I'm not going to run.
I'm going to stand right here
and watch you.
Every blow will cut into my heart...
...and tell me who and what you are.
Down, down, down!
Father, no. I beg you.
Silence!
Send her back to Burma.
No. She'll be killed.
Send her back.
Bring them back.
See what you've done?
Go back. Go back.
I have brought disgrace to you.
No. You brought love.
Far better than crown or throne.
You...
...give these up?
For you.
lf we stay, death.
lf we go to Burma, death.
We have no country to go to.
We make our own country, in jungle.
You, me, a country of us.
-Go back, Louis.
-I want to help.
Not for boy. You'll get hurt.
That's what you said about kickboxing,
and I bloodied your nose.
into jungle!
Go to the ancient place of the elephants.
A.P.O.E.?
That's where I'll drive them to.
Bring back their bodies...
...after the...
...accident.
There's going to be an accident?
Oh, yes.
You're so smart.
Of course I'm smart.
I'm going to be king.
Big deal you are. You can yell
at Little fat man with teeth missing.
Everything is working out perfectly...
...for me.
Are dangerous animals in jungle?
I do not know.
First time in jungle.
Quickly. This way.
So sorry to frighten you...
...but I couldn't let you go that way.
Which way?
Decisions, decisions. Let me help you.
Stay to the right, the right.
To the right!
How will you get to the ancient place
of the elephants...
...if you go that way?
When I make my report,
the entire fleet will be dispatched.
That'll be that for this King of Siam.
And if something dire happens
to those young people....
Edward, please.
The man's a brute, he's....
He's not a gentleman.
The King!
-Stop!
-Look out!
This river edge of kingdom.
lf we cross, we are safe.
There.
Yes! Yes!
I've got them just where I want them.
I go first. Make certain.
Thank you.
Soon, they fall in river, float down...
...then get sucked into A.P.O.E.
And that be that.
The "Kralalome" very good
at "kralaloming."
it's safe enough.
Come, Tuptim.
You can do it.
No!
The Prince is history!
And I am the future.
No!
Yes!
What?
Father, she's gone.
Hurry, Rama, to the other side.
I see the balloon.
The King has the Prince with him.
But no Tuptim.
What about Louis?
Do you see him?
No.
No. This I must do.
Quick, Little brain,
what would Kralahome do?
Hurry, Rama. Down.
Please, don't let it be a mango.
Fire.
There's Louis. He's safe.
Thank Heaven.
Father.
Look out.
Rama, up.
Faster, Rama.
Thank you.
all right. You did it. You did it.
I hate happy endings.
it's not over yet.
There they are, Edward.
And look.
There's Louis.
Good fellow, this king of yours. Well done.
Anna, where are you going?
No!
Quick, must jump while over water.
No.
Rama.
Jump.
Siam is mine.
Sir Edward.
I can explain this.
Papa.
I will say when is time to cry.
Chululongkorn. Rise.
Mrs. Anna...
...you take notes.
You take notes from next king.
Maybe I get better...
...maybe not.
Why is your head higher than mine?
Suppose you are king.
What would you do?
I would...
...make proclamations.
Yes, yes?
First:
Regarding who Shall have books.
I believe learning
is good thing for everyone.
Possibly, even scientific.
Second:
No more bowing like toad.
I don't believe this is good thing...
...causing embarrassing fatigue...
...etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
Up, up, up.
Two lines, like soldiers.
And further--
More?
all persons Shall have freedom
to marry who they want.
Even...
...royal prince.
You are angry with me, Father?
Why do you ask question?
When you are king...
...you know.
Some day, my son, you will be great king.
You will bow. The gentlemen, in this way.
Only bending at the waist.
Very good.
Now, the ladies will make dip...
...like British.
No, no. Just the girls dip.
The boys must bow, like this.
No, just the boys bow.
Are you listening to me?
Haven't they heard of elephant litter?
One good thing about the new job,
O Soiled One...
...I have a tall, stupid assistant.
No. I am begging you.
I brush you every hour,
I floss you every second, l--
Traitor.
You wanted to see me, Your Majesty?
Proclamation my son made...
...I believe to be your fault.
I hope so, Your Majesty.
I do hope so.
You have been most difficult woman.
I think there be many English women...
...but only one Mrs. Anna.
God is merciful.
Yes, Your Majesty.
God is merciful.
You...
...still intend to leave?
I'm not sure.
This heart of mine,
which you say I have not got--
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I said many things.
You have been great help to me...
...and I wish to make gift.
That is not necessary.
I will tell what is necessary.
Go.
Outside palace. You like?
I'm speechless.
For once.
At banquet, we did not dance.
No, Your Majesty.
Was...
...looking forward.
As was I.
You would accept
dancing invitation from King?
No. Your Majesty.
But I would accept gladly...
...from a very good friend.
Good. Now.
Now, Your Majesty?
You teach, you teach, you teach!
Well, it's very simple, the polka.
it goes: One, two, three
and one, two, three and...
...one, two, three and....
"Shall we dance?
"On a bright cloud of music
"Shall we fly?
"Shall we dance?
"Shall we then say goodnight
"and mean goodbye?
"Or perchance
"When the last Little star has left the sky
"Shall we still be together
"With our arms around each other?
"And Shall you be my new
"romance?
"On the clear understanding
"That this kind of thing can happen
"Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
"Shall we dance?"
Something wrong.
I know, I forget "and."
This time I remember.
One, two, three
and one, two, three and one, two....
That's splendid, Your Majesty.
Splendid, splendid. One, two and one....
You have throw me off count.
And one, two, three
and one, two, three and one, two....
But...
...this is not right.
Yes, it is. You were doing--
No, not holding hands like this.
No. As a matter of fact....
Was...
...like...
...this.
Yes.
Come. We do it again.
